          "rationale": "First, I need to assess the current board state and the positions of all snakes and apples. My snake (ID 0) is at (6, 2) with no body. The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (0, 4) with no body. Apples are at (6, 6), (0, 3), (7, 8), (7, 1), and (3, 5).\n\nSince it's turn 0, and both snakes have no body, we're both just heads. I need to move in a way that avoids immediate death and sets me up to collect apples efficiently.\n\nLet me list the possible moves and check for immediate dangers:\n\n- Current position: (6, 2)\n- Possible moves:\n  - UP: to (6, 3)\n  - DOWN: to (6, 1)\n  - LEFT: to (5, 2)\n  - RIGHT: to (7, 2)\n\nNow, check each move for safety:\n\n1. UP to (6, 3):\n   - Is it on the board? Yes, y=3 is within 0-9.\n   - Is it occupied by any snake body? No, both snakes have no body.\n   - Is it occupied by an enemy snake head? Enemy is at (0, 4), so no.\n   - Moving into my own body? No body, so no.\n   - Moving backwards? No body, so not applicable.\n   - So, UP seems safe.\n\n2. DOWN to (6, 1):\n   - y=1 is on board.\n   - No snake bodies.\n   - Enemy head at (0,4), so no.\n   - No body to hit.\n   - Safe.\n\n3. LEFT to (5, 2):\n   - x=5 is on board.\n   - No snake bodies.\n   - Enemy head at (0,4), so no.\n   - Safe.\n\n4. RIGHT to (7, 2):\n   - x=7 is on board.\n   - No snake bodies.\n   - Enemy head at (0,4), so no.\n   - Safe.\n\nAll moves seem immediately safe since there are no obstacles near me. Now, I need to consider which move is best for collecting apples and keeping future options open.\n\nApples are at:\n- (6, 6) - directly above my current position (6,2), so 4 steps up.\n- (0, 3) - to the left and up from enemy, but far from me.\n- (7, 8) - up and right.\n- (7, 1) - down and right from me.\n- (3, 5) - left and up.\n\nI should prioritize apples that are closer to me. From (6,2), the closest apple might be (7,1) or (6,6). Let's calculate distances:\n\n- Distance to (7,1): delta x = 1, delta y = -1, so |dx| + |dy| = 2 steps.\n- Distance to (6,6): dx=0, dy=4, so 4 steps.\n- Distance to (3,5): dx=-3, dy=3, so 6 steps.\n- Distance to (0,3): dx=-6, dy=1, so 7 steps.\n- Distance to (7,8): dx=1, dy=6, so 7 steps.\n\nSo, (7,1) is the closest, only 2 steps away if I go RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT. But I need to consider that the enemy snake might also be moving towards apples, and I need to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nAlso, since both snakes start with no body, we will grow when we eat an apple, which might affect future moves.\n\nFirst, I need to decide my immediate move. I should move towards an apple that is both close and safe.\n\nConsider moving RIGHT to (7,2). From there, I could go DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple at (7,1). Similarly, moving DOWN to (6,1) could then go RIGHT to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake. The enemy is at (0,4). Apples near the enemy are (0,3), which is just below it, and (3,5) is somewhat close, but not directly adjacent.\n\nThe enemy might move to eat (0,3) since it's very close: from (0,4) to (0,3) is DOWN. So, if the enemy moves DOWN, it will eat (0,3) and grow. But that apple is far from me, so it's not a immediate concern for me.\n\nI should focus on getting the closest apple to me, which is (7,1). However, I need to ensure that after I eat it, I have safe moves available.\n\nBut since I'm only deciding my first move now, I should think one step ahead.\n\nLet me list possible moves and what they lead to:\n\n- If I move UP to (6,3): then from there, I can go to (6,4), (5,3), (7,3), etc. I could head towards (6,6), but it's still far.\n\n- If I move DOWN to (6,1): then from there, I can go to (6,0), (5,1), (7,1). (7,1) has an apple, so I could eat it next turn by moving RIGHT.\n\n- If I move LEFT to (5,2): then from there, I can go to (5,3), (4,2), (6,2), (5,1). (5,1) is empty, and I might head towards (3,5) or (0,3), but those are farther.\n\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,2): then from there, I can go to (7,3), (6,2), (8,2), (7,1). (7,1) has an apple, so I could eat it next turn by moving DOWN.\n\nSo, moving DOWN or RIGHT both set me up to eat the apple at (7,1) on the next turn.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any dangers from the enemy snake. Since the enemy is at (0,4), and apples are at (0,3), (3,5), etc., the enemy might move towards (0,3) or (3,5). It's unlikely to come to my side (x=6-7) quickly because it would have to cross the board.\n\nAlso, after I eat an apple, I grow, so my body will start to form. I need to avoid trapping myself later.\n\nAnother thing: if I move to a cell that has an apple, I eat it immediately. In this case, none of the adjacent cells have apples. (7,1) is at (7,1), which is not adjacent to (6,2); it's adjacent to (7,2) and (6,1), etc. Let's confirm:\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- (6,3) has no apple\n- (6,1) has no apple? Wait, apples are at (7,1), (6,6), etc. So (6,1) is empty.\n- (5,2) empty\n- (7,2) empty\n\nSo, no immediate apple to eat in one move. I have to move to a empty cell first.\n\nSo, for turn 0, I just move to a safe cell that sets me up for future apple eating.\n\nI should also consider the board size and avoiding getting stuck. The board is 10x10, so plenty of space.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the center or towards multiple apples. Let's see the apple distribution:\n\n- (6,6) top-center\n- (0,3) left-bottom\n- (7,8) right-top\n- (7,1) right-bottom\n- (3,5) center-left\n\nSo, apples are scattered. I might want to go for a cluster, but they are not very clustered.\n\nSince (7,1) is very close, and (7,2) is adjacent to it, I might go RIGHT to (7,2) so that next turn I can go DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly, if I go DOWN to (6,1), I can then go RIGHT to (7,1) to eat it.\n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are good options for eating (7,1).\n\nBut is there a preference? Let's see what other options I have after moving DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,1):\n- Then next turn, I can go to (6,0), (5,1), (7,1), or back UP to (6,2). \n- (6,0) is on the board, bottom row. \n- (5,1) is safe.\n- (7,1) has apple, so I'd eat it and grow.\n- After eating, my body will be at (6,1) and (6,2)? No, when I eat, I grow, so my new body will include the previous head position. \n  - After moving to (6,1), if I eat the apple at (7,1), that means on turn 1, I move from (6,1) to (7,1), eat apple, so my head becomes (7,1), and my body becomes [(6,1), (6,2)]? Wait, no.\n  - Let's clarify snake movement:\n    - Initially, my snake: head (6,2), no body.\n    - Turn 0: I move to, say, (6,1). After move, my head is (6,1), and since I didn't eat, my body remains none? No, in snake games, when you move, your body follows. Since I have no body now, after moving, I still have no body unless I eat.\n    - Actually, from the problem: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So, if I don't eat, I don't grow. So after moving to (6,1), my head is (6,1), and body is none because I didn't eat. Similarly for any move without eating.\n    - Only when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning that after eating, the next turn, my body will include the previous head positions.\n\nBut in this case, since I have no body, after moving without eating, I still have no body. So I'm just a head moving around.\n\nSimilarly for enemy snake.\n\nSo, after moving to (6,1), I have no body, so I can turn in any direction without worrying about hitting my own body, since there is no body.\n\nBut after I eat an apple, I will grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nFor now, since I have no body, all moves are safe as long as I don't go off board or into another snake's body.\n\nEnemy snake also has no body, so its body is empty.\n\nNow, back to moving to eat (7,1). From (6,2), if I go DOWN to (6,1), then next turn I can go RIGHT to (7,1) and eat the apple. Similarly, if I go RIGHT to (7,2), then next turn I can go DOWN to (7,1) and eat the apple.\n\nSo both paths lead to eating the apple on turn 1.\n\nBut which one is better? I need to think about after eating the apple.\n\nSuppose I eat the apple on turn 1. Then, after eating, my head is at (7,1), and I grow one segment. Since I grew, on turn 2, when I move, my body will now include the position I was at before eating. So, if I ate on turn 1 by moving to (7,1), then before eating, my head was at, say, (6,1) or (7,2), depending on how I got there.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nOption A: Move DOWN to (6,1) on turn 0.\n- Turn 0: move to (6,1). Head: (6,1), body: none (since no apple eaten).\n- Turn 1: from (6,1), I move RIGHT to (7,1). Since (7,1) has an apple, I eat it. So after move, head is (7,1), and I grow. My body now becomes the previous head position, which is (6,1). So now, snake is: head (7,1), body: [(6,1)].\n- Turn 2: I need to move from (7,1). Possible moves: (7,2), (6,1), (8,1), (7,0). But (6,1) is my body, so I cannot move into my own body. So moving LEFT to (6,1) would kill me because it's directly behind my head? Wait, the rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So if my head is at (7,1), and body is at (6,1), which is directly left, so moving LEFT to (6,1) would be moving into my own body, and it's directly backwards, so I die. So I cannot move LEFT. Other moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT are possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved differently.\n\nNow, Option B: Move RIGHT to (7,2) on turn 0.\n- Turn 0: move to (7,2). Head: (7,2), body: none.\n- Turn 1: from (7,2), move DOWN to (7,1). Eat apple. Head: (7,1), body: [(7,2)].\n- Turn 2: from (7,1), possible moves: UP to (7,2), but (7,2) is my body, so cannot move UP (backwards into body). Other moves: DOWN to (7,0), LEFT to (6,1), RIGHT to (8,1).\n\nSo, in both cases, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will be at the position I came from, so one of the adjacent cells becomes my body, and I cannot move back into it.\n\nNow, which initial move gives me more options after eating?\n\nAfter eating, I need to have multiple safe moves to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFrom above:\n- If I came from DOWN (i.e., from (6,1) to (7,1)), then my body is at (6,1), so I cannot move LEFT to (6,1). I can move UP to (7,2), DOWN to (7,0), RIGHT to (8,1). So three options.\n\n- If I came from RIGHT (i.e., from (7,2) to (7,1)), then my body is at (7,2), so I cannot move UP to (7,2). I can move DOWN to (7,0), LEFT to (6,1), RIGHT to (8,1). So again three options.\n\nSo both seem similar in terms of options after eating.\n\nBut now, I need to consider the enemy snake. The enemy is at (0,4). It might be moving towards apples. The apple at (0,3) is very close, so likely the enemy will move DOWN to (0,3) on turn 0, eat it, and grow. Similarly, other apples might be targets.\n\nBut since the enemy is far from me, it might not affect my immediate moves.\n\nHowever, I should consider the apple at (6,6). It's directly above me, and after eating (7,1), I might want to go towards (6,6) or other apples.\n\nBut let's see the distances after eating (7,1).\n\nAfter eating, my head is at (7,1). Then, from there:\n- To (6,6): dx=-1, dy=5, so 6 steps.\n- To (3,5): dx=-4, dy=4, so 8 steps.\n- To (7,8): dx=0, dy=7, so 7 steps.\n- To (0,3): dx=-7, dy=2, so 9 steps, but enemy might have eaten it.\n\nSo, (6,6) is still relatively close, but not as close as (7,1) was.\n\nBut I have to eat one apple at a time.\n\nAnother thing: there are multiple apples, so I might not need to go far immediately.\n\nBut since the game is only 150 turns, and I need to get 50 apples to win, but that's far off, so for now, I should just collect apples efficiently.\n\nBut in practice, with 10x10 board, 50 apples is a lot, so probably we won't reach 50, but the game might end earlier if one snake dies or after 150 turns.\n\nSo, for now, I should focus on getting apples without risking death.\n\nNow, back to my immediate move: which one to choose?\n\nI think either DOWN or RIGHT is fine, but I might have a slight preference for RIGHT because it moves me towards the right side, where there are two apples: (7,1) and (7,8). After eating (7,1), I might go towards (7,8), which is up from there.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, I might go towards (6,6) or other apples.\n\nBut let's see the board: after eating (7,1), if I am at (7,1), and I want to go to (7,8), I can go UP multiple times, but I have to be careful not to hit walls or myself.\n\nSince I will have a body after eating, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nBut since I have only one body segment after eating one apple, it's unlikely to trap me immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake might also be going for apples, but since we are far apart, collision is unlikely in early turns.\n\nI should also consider that apples might respawn or new apples might appear, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I assume apples are fixed until eaten.\n\nThe problem says \"multi-apple Snake game\", and apples are listed, so probably apples are static until eaten.\n\nSo, I need to eat them in some order.\n\nNow, to decide between DOWN and RIGHT, let's see if there is any advantage to being at (7,2) or (6,1).\n\nFrom (7,2), I am at x=7, which is the second last column, so moving RIGHT would go to (8,2), then (9,2), and then I might be limited in directions since x=9 is the wall, so I have to be careful not to get trapped against the wall.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,1), I am at x=6, y=1, which is near the bottom, so moving DOWN would go to (6,0), which is the bottom wall, so again, might be trapped if not careful.\n\nBut since I have no body, I can always turn away from the wall.\n\nFor example, from (7,2), if I go RIGHT to (8,2), then from there I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT to (9,2). From (9,2), I can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT, since RIGHT is off board. So fewer options.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,1), if I go DOWN to (6,0), from there I can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT, since DOWN is off board.\n\nSo, to keep options open, it might be better to avoid going to the edges immediately.\n\nCurrently, from (6,2), going DOWN to (6,1) is moving towards the bottom edge, but y=1 is not the edge yet; y=0 is the edge. So from (6,1), I have DOWN to (6,0), which is the edge.\n\nSimilarly, going RIGHT to (7,2) is moving towards the right edge, but x=7 is not the edge; x=9 is the edge.\n\nSo, both moves bring me closer to an edge, but not directly to the edge.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can still go LEFT to (5,1), UP to (6,2), RIGHT to (7,1), so three directions except DOWN to the edge.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can go LEFT to (6,2), UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), RIGHT to (8,2), so four directions.\n\nSo, from (7,2), I have more directions available than from (6,1)? From (6,1), I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN (to edge). So four directions as well, but DOWN leads to edge, which might reduce options later.\n\nBut since I might not go DOWN, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving UP or LEFT to stay away from edges.\n\nBut moving UP to (6,3) brings me closer to (6,6), which is an apple, but it's 4 steps away, whereas (7,1) is only 2 steps away.\n\nSo, moving towards (7,1) seems faster.\n\nAlso, (7,1) is in the corner, but from there, I can go to other places.\n\nAnother thought: if I move RIGHT to (7,2), and then DOWN to (7,1), I eat the apple. But after that, I might want to go to (6,6). From (7,1), to go to (6,6), I need to go UP and LEFT. So, I can go UP to (7,2), but that might be my body if I came from there, so I cannot go back immediately. So from (7,1), if I came from (7,2), I cannot go UP, so I have to go LEFT to (6,1) or DOWN to (7,0) or RIGHT to (8,1). Then from there, I can go UP.\n\nSimilarly, if I came from (6,1) to (7,1), I cannot go LEFT, so I have to go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Then from UP, I can go to (7,2) etc.\n\nSo, in both cases, I have to make at least one move before I can start going towards (6,6).\n\nBut since (6,6) is far, it might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. For turn 0, all moves are safe, and both DOWN and RIGHT set me up to eat an apple on turn 1. So I can choose either.\n\nBut let's see if there is any reason to choose one over the other.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the enemy's potential move. If the enemy moves to eat an apple, it might grow, but since it's far, it doesn't affect me.\n\nAnother thing: if I move RIGHT, I go to (7,2), which is closer to the apple at (7,8), but that's far.\n\nI recall that in Snake games, sometimes it's better to avoid the edges to have more maneuvering space. So moving to (7,2) might be slightly better because it's not as close to the bottom edge as (6,1) is to the bottom edge? (6,1) is y=1, which is one step from bottom, while (7,2) is y=2, two steps from bottom. So from (7,2), I have more room below than from (6,1)? No, from (6,1), if I go DOWN, I hit bottom, but from (7,2), if I go DOWN, I go to (7,1), which is still above bottom, then to (7,0), bottom. So from (7,2), I can go DOWN twice to hit bottom, while from (6,1), I can go DOWN once to hit bottom. So from (6,1), I am closer to the bottom, so slightly more constrained if I go further down.\n\nBut since I might not go down, it might not matter.\n\nPerhaps I should move UP to (6,3) to stay away from edges initially.\n\nBut that doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. The closest apple is (7,1), which is to the south-east, so moving DOWN or RIGHT is towards it.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT to (7,2). Why? Because from there, I have more options to go to other apples later. For example, from (7,2), I can go UP to (7,3) and continue up towards (7,8), or go LEFT towards (6,6), etc.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,1), I can go LEFT towards (3,5) or UP towards (6,6), but (3,5) is farther.\n\nBut let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple from current position (6,2):\n- (6,6): |6-6| + |6-2| = 0+4=4\n- (0,3): |0-6| + |3-2| =6+1=7\n- (7,8): |7-6| + |8-2| =1+6=7\n- (7,1): |7-6| + |1-2| =1+1=2\n- (3,5): |3-6| + |5-2| =3+3=6\n\nSo (7,1) is closest, then (6,6), then (3,5), then others.\n\nSo, I should prioritize (7,1).\n\nNow, from (6,2), to get to (7,1), I can go RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT.\n\nBut in terms of immediate move, I need to move one step.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (7,2), then from there I can move DOWN to (7,1) on turn 1.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,1), then on turn 1 I move RIGHT to (7,1).\n\nSo both sequences take two turns to reach the apple, but I eat on turn 1.\n\nActually, on turn 0, I move to an adjacent cell, and on turn 1, I move to the apple and eat it. So I eat on turn 1.\n\nNow, is there any difference in how the enemy moves? Since the enemy is at (0,4), it might move to eat (0,3) on turn 0. If it does, it will eat it and grow, but since it's far, it doesn't affect me.\n\nSo, for my move, I'll choose RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any risk of head-on collision. For example, if the enemy moves to a cell that I move to, but since we are far apart, it's unlikely. The enemy is at (0,4), and I am at (6,2), so we are 6 columns away, so no collision possible in one move.\n\nAlso, no other snakes, so safe.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is a good move.\n\nI could also move DOWN, but let's see if moving DOWN has any advantage. If I move DOWN to (6,1), then after eating apple at (7,1), I might go towards (6,6) more directly? From (7,1), if I go UP to (7,2), then LEFT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), etc., towards (6,6). But from (7,1) after eating, if I came from (6,1), I cannot go LEFT to (6,1) because it's my body, so I have to go UP to (7,2), then from there I can go LEFT to (6,2), etc. So it takes two moves to get back to (6,2) direction.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved RIGHT first to (7,2), then ate apple from (7,2) to (7,1), then from (7,1) I cannot go UP to (7,2) (my body), so I have to go LEFT to (6,1), then from there I can go UP to (6,2), etc. So again, similar.\n\nSo, no significant difference.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the apple at (7,8). If I am at (7,2), I am on the same column, so I can go up multiple times to reach it. After eating (7,1), I might go up to (7,2), but if I came from (7,2), I cannot go up immediately, so I have to go left or right first, then up.\n\nBut eventually, I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,1), I am not on the same column for (7,8), so I have to move right first.\n\nBut since (7,8) is far, I might not worry about it now.\n\nI think I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nBut let's see the board state again. There is an apple at (7,1), and I am at (6,2). So moving RIGHT brings me closer to it.\n\nAlso, in the board drawing, at row 2, column 7 is empty, so safe.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, I need to write my rationale for future self.\n\nThe instruction says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo, I should include a plan.\n\nFor example, after moving RIGHT to (7,2), on turn 1, I plan to move DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple. Then after eating, I have body at (7,2), so I cannot move UP, so I might move LEFT to (6,1) or DOWN to (7,0) or RIGHT to (8,1). From there, I can consider going towards (6,6) or other apples.\n\nBut since I might not know what the enemy does, I should keep options open.\n\nSo, for my plan, I can say: \"Plan: Move RIGHT to (7,2) to set up for eating apple at (7,1) on next turn. After eating, consider moving towards (6,6) or other apples while avoiding walls and own body.\"\n\nBut I need to be careful not to mention future directions after the move, because the final line must be only the move word.\n\nSo, in the response, I should have my rationale, then the plan, then the move.\n\nBut the move must be the last word, so after the plan, I need to write the move on its own line.\n\nLet's structure the response.\n\nFirst, I think out loud: I need to choose a move. All moves are safe, but I want to go for the closest apple at (7,1). Moving RIGHT to (7,2) allows me to go DOWN to (7,1) next turn. Similarly, moving DOWN to (6,1) allows me to go RIGHT to (7,1). I choose RIGHT because it positions me on the same column as another apple (7,8) and gives me more flexibility to move up or left after eating.\n\nBut I think I'm rationalizing.\n\nAnother point: after eating the apple, I grow, and since I have a body, I need to avoid trapping myself. By moving RIGHT first, I might have more space after eating because from (7,1) I can go left to (6,1) which is empty, whereas if I move DOWN first, from (7,1) I can go up to (7,2) which is empty, so similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nI'll go with RIGHT.\n\nSo, my final decision: RIGHT\n\nBut let's write the response.\n\nFirst, the rationale: \"I am at (6,2) with no body. Apples are at (6,6), (0,3), (7,8), (7,1), (3,5). The closest apple is (7,1) at distance 2. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) sets up to eat (7,1) on next turn by moving DOWN. All moves are safe, but moving RIGHT keeps me away from the bottom edge and closer to the right side where apples are present.\"\n\nThen, a plan: \"Plan: Move RIGHT to (7,2), then on turn 1 move DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple. After eating, consider moving towards (6,6) or (7,8) while avoiding own body and walls.\"\n\nThen, the move: RIGHT\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" and \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nSo, I need to have the plan before the move, and the move on its own line at the end.\n\nAlso, I should not mention future directions after the move, so in the plan, I can mention what I plan to do, but after that, only the move word.\n\nIn this case, my plan says \"then on turn 1 move DOWN\", which is mentioning a future direction, but that's in the plan, which is before the move line. I think it's allowed as long as the final line is only the move word.\n\nTo be safe, I'll keep the plan general.\n\nPerhaps: \"Plan: After moving, head towards the apple at (7,1) and then consider other apples like (6,6).\"\n\nBut since I'm moving RIGHT, and then DOWN to eat, it's specific.\n\nI think it's okay.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to write it in the specified format.\n\nLet me draft theI am at (6,2) with no body. The closest apple is at (7,1), which is only two steps away. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) positions me to eat that apple on the next turn by moving DOWN. This move is safe and keeps me away from the bottom edge, offering flexibility to move towards other apples like (6,6) or (7,8) later. All four directions are immediately safe, but RIGHT sets up a efficient path to collect my first apple.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (7,2), then on turn 1 move DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple. After eating, prioritize moving towards (6,6) or (7,8) while avoiding walls and my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

No, the prompt says I am at 7,1 with body at 7,2). Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n  1 . . . . . . . 0 . .\n  0 . . . . . . . . . .\nThis corresponds to Y=1 having '0' and Y=2 having 'T'. This matches my state: Head (7,1), Body (7,2). This means I successfully moved DOWN last turn (from 7,2 to 7,1) and ate the apple. However, I should have grown.\nWait, if I ate, my body should be [(7,2), (7,3)] (assuming I was at 7,3 before? No, the last turn rationale said I was at (7,2) with no body).\nActually, the board state provided *is* the current state *before* I make my move for Turn 2.\nGiven the prompt says \"Turn: 2 / 150\" and provides the board, I must trust the board.\nBoard Y=1 has '0' at X=7. Board Y=2 has 'T' at X=7.\nSo my head is at (7,1). My tail is at (7,2).\nThis implies I have length 2. (Head + Tail).\nI previously had length 1 (Head at 7,2).\nI moved down to 7,1 and ate. Standard snake logic says you grow, so you don't move your tail. So I should be Head(7,1), Body(7,2).\nBut the prompt says \"Body: [(7,2)]\". That matches.\nSo my tail is at (7,2). This is the cell directly *above* my head (7,1).\nThis is important: I cannot move UP (backwards) because that would hit my own tail.\n\nLet's evaluate moves for Turn 2 from Head (7,1):\n1.  **UP**: To (7,2). This is my tail. Since I just moved here, the tail is still there. Moving backwards kills me. **INVALID**.\n2.  **DOWN**: To (7,0). Valid coordinate. Check board Y=0, X=7: `.` (Empty). No snake bodies. No immediate suicide. **VALID**.\n3.  **LEFT**: To (6,1). Valid. Board Y=1, X=6: `.`. Empty. **VALID**.\n4.  **RIGHT**: To (8,1). Valid. Board Y=1, X=8: `.`. Empty. **VALID**.\n\nNow, let's look for apples.\nApples: (6, 6), (7, 8), (3, 5), (5, 9), (8, 9).\nCurrent head: (7, 1).\nDistance to (6,1) = 0 (adjacent).\nDistance to (7,0) = 0 (adjacent).\nDistance to (8,1) = 0 (adjacent).\nNone of these are apples. The closest apples are at least 4-5 moves away.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nSnake #1: Head (0,4), Body (0,3). Far left. Not an immediate threat.\n\nLet's evaluate future safety.\n*   **UP (7,2)**: Blocked by my tail. Dead end immediately.\n*   **DOWN (7,0)**: Bottom edge of board. If I go here, my only options next turn will be UP (back on myself), LEFT (6,0), or RIGHT (8,0). It's a restrictive move, but not immediately fatal if I don't get stuck.\n*   **LEFT (6,1)**: Opens up the left side of the board (X 0-6).\n*   **RIGHT (8,1)**: Opens up the right side of the board (X 8-9).\n\nApples (8,9) and (7,8) are on the right/top.\nApples (6,6) and (3,5) are center/left.\nApple (5,9) is top/left.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (7,0):\nI am at the bottom wall. Next turn I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\nIf I go UP, I return to (7,1) (where I am now). That's a loop.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0), I can traverse the bottom row.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0), I can traverse the bottom row.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,1):\nI am in the open field.\nNext turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nUP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), RIGHT to (7,1) (occupied by tail? No, if I move LEFT, my tail will move to (7,1)? No, I ate last turn, so I didn't shrink. My body is currently (7,2). If I move LEFT to (6,1), my new body becomes [(7,1), (7,2)].\nSo (7,1) becomes a body segment.\nSo next turn, if I am at (6,1), (7,1) is blocked.\nBut I have other options.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (8,1):\nI am near the right wall.\nNext turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nRIGHT to (9,1) is wall.\nLEFT back to (7,1) (will be body).\nUP to (8,2), DOWN to (8,0).\n\nComparison:\nLeft gives me more horizontal space towards the center apples (6,6) and (3,5).\nRight gives me access to (8,9) and (7,8) but I am constricted by the wall at X=9.\nDown puts me on the bottom wall, restricting vertical movement.\n\nThe prompt strategy says: \"keep future options open\".\nLeft seems to offer the most open space in the \"lower middle\" of the board.\nHowever, (8,9) is a specific apple on the board.\nLet's check the board again.\nRow 9: `A` at (6,9)? No, board shows `.` at (6,9). `A` at (5,9) in the list? No, list says (5,9). Board shows `.` at (5,9). The board drawing is simplified. The `A`s in the drawing are at (6,6), (7,8) based on coordinates? No, the drawing `A`s are scattered. The list is the ground truth.\n\nLet's assume the enemy stays away.\nI need to eat. The nearest apple is (6,6). Distance 5.\n(7,8) is distance 7.\n(3,5) is distance 4.\n(5,9) is distance 8.\n(8,9) is distance 9.\n\nThe closest is (3,5) if I go Left, and (6,6) if I go Left/Up.\nIf I go Right, I am moving away from the densest cluster (3,5, 6,6).\nIf I go Down, I am moving away from all apples (all have Y >= 5).\n\nSo, UP is death.\nDOWN is bad (wall, moving away from apples).\nRIGHT is moving towards the corner (9,9), moving away from most apples (3,5, 6,6).\nLEFT is moving towards the center/apples (3,5, 6,6).\n\nSo LEFT is the best move for objective.\nIs it safe?\nBoard shows `.` at (6,1).\nEnemy is at (0,4). He would need 5 moves to get to me. I am safe.\n\nWait, I should also consider the \"Head-on collision\" rule.\nIf I move to (6,1), could the enemy move there? No, he is too far.\nWhat if I move to (7,0)? Down. Is that safer?\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (7,0).\nIf I go LEFT from there, I am at (6,0).\nFrom (6,0), I can go UP to (6,1).\nThis is a path.\nBut going LEFT now to (6,1) skips the step at the wall.\nWhy would I want to be at the wall? It reduces my moves from 4 to 3 (except when at corners).\nSo avoiding walls is generally good.\n\nLet's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\nMy tail is at (7,2). My head is (7,1).\nIf I go UP, I hit my tail. Dead.\nIf I go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, I am safe.\n\nLet's look at the board row Y=1 again.\n`1 . . . . . . . 0 . .`\nIndices 0-9.\nAt index 7 is '0'.\nSo (7,1) is head.\nLeft of it (6,1) is `.`.\nRight of it (8,1) is `.`.\nDown (7,0) is `.`.\n\nLet's consider the apple (6,6).\nIf I go LEFT now, I am at (6,1).\nNext turn I can go UP to (6,2).\nNext to (6,3).\n(6,4).\n(6,5).\n(6,6). That's 5 moves from now.\nIf I go DOWN now, I am at (7,0).\nNext turn LEFT to (6,0).\nNext turn UP to (6,1).\nThat puts me at (6,1) in 2 turns instead of 1.\nGoing LEFT now is faster to the target.\nGoing DOWN is a detour.\n\nIs there any danger in moving LEFT?\nThe enemy is at (0,4). He moves randomly or towards apples.\nApples are at (3,5), (6,6), etc.\nIf he moves towards (3,5), he stays left.\nHe has no reason to come to (7,1) or (6,1).\nSo it's safe.\n\nFinal check on \"Future options\".\nIf I go LEFT to (6,1):\nI have 3 options next turn (assuming tail at 7,1).\nUP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1).\nRIGHT is blocked by my body (7,1).\nSo I have 3 directions.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,0):\nI have 3 options next turn (assuming tail at 7,1).\nLEFT (6,0), RIGHT (8,0), UP (7,1).\nSo also 3 directions.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,1):\nI have 3 options next turn (assuming tail at 7,1).\nUP (8,2), DOWN (8,0), LEFT (7,1).\nAlso 3 directions.\n\nSo all safe moves give 3 directions next turn.\nHowever, LEFT moves me towards the apples with Y > 1.\nDOWN moves me to Y=0 (lowest Y).\nRIGHT moves me to X=8 (high X, near wall).\nThe apples with Y > 1 are (3,5), (6,6), (7,8), (5,9), (8,9).\nThe apples with X > 7 are (7,8), (8,9). Only two.\nApples with X < 7 are (3,5), (6,6), (5,9). Three apples.\nAlso (5,9) has X=5, Y=9.\nSo moving LEFT puts me in the general direction of 3 apples.\nMoving RIGHT puts me in direction of 2 apples.\nMoving DOWN puts me in direction of 0 apples (I have to go back up).\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the statistically best move for targets.\n\nOne edge case: What if the enemy moves to (6,1)? He is at (0,4).\nDistance to (6,1) is |0-6| + |4-1| = 6 + 3 = 9.\nHe needs 9 turns. I am there in 1. Safe.\nWhat if he moves to (5,1)? Distance 8. Safe.\n\nSo, LEFT.\nWait, I should write a plan.\nPlan: Move towards the cluster of apples at (3,5) and (6,6). Keep options open by avoiding walls.\nTarget: (3,5) or (6,6).\nCurrent move: LEFT.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... the first tuple is the head\".\nMy state: Head (7,1), Body [(7,2)].\nSo my body is directly above me.\nIf I move LEFT, my new state will be Head (6,1), Body [(7,1), (7,2)].\nThis is valid.\n\nLet's double check the board state provided again to ensure I am not hallucinating coordinates.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . . 0 . .`\nColumns 0 to 9.\nAt col 7: '0'.\nSo head is at (7,1). Correct.\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . . T . .`\nAt col 7: 'T'.\nSo tail is at (7,2). Correct.\nSo my body is a vertical line upwards.\nMoving UP is suicide.\nMoving DOWN is to (7,0).\nMoving LEFT is to (6,1).\nMoving RIGHT is to (8,1).\n\nI'll output LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any scenario where DOWN is better?\nIf an enemy is chasing me from above? No.\nIf there is a trap at (6,1)? No, board is empty.\nIf I want to hide? No, I need apples to win.\n\nOkay, LEFT is the choice.\n\nOne final check on the \"Simultaneous movement\" rule.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,1), and an enemy moves to (6,1), we die.\nWhere is the enemy?\nSnake #1: Head (0,4).\nPossible moves for snake #1:\n- UP: (0,5)\n- DOWN: (0,3)\n- LEFT: (-1,4) -> Dead (wall)\n- RIGHT: (1,4)\nNone of these are (6,1).\nSo no head-on collision.\n\nWhat if my move is RIGHT to (8,1)?\nEnemy moves to (1,4) or (0,5).\nNo collision.\nBut RIGHT is just worse for apples.\n\nWhat if my move is DOWN to (7,0)?\nEnemy moves to (1,4).\nSafe.\nBut DOWN is away from apples.\n\nSo, LEFT.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT towards (6,6) and (3,5).\nAvoid walls.\nWatch out for enemy #1 at (0,4).\n\nThe prompt asks for a \"short long-term plan\".\n\"Move towards the central apples (6,6) or (3,5).\"\n\nThe prompt requires the final line to be exactly one word.\nI will output LEFT.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

While this is a safe move for this turn, it limits my vertical movement options next turn and moves me away from the apples, which are located in the upper half of the board (Y-coordinates 5 through 9).\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 1):** Moves me closer to the right wall (X=9). This restricts horizontal movement and again moves me slightly away from the nearest apple cluster.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 1):** This is the strongest move. It moves me towards the center of the board and the two closest apples at (3, 5) and (6, 6). It keeps the maximum number of future paths open.\n\n2.  **Threat Assessment:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (0, 4). He is on the far left side of the board, distance of 6 units horizontally and 2-3 units vertically. He cannot reach me in the next turn. No immediate threat.\n    *   **Collisions:** I have no body parts in adjacent cells other than my tail above me. I can safely move LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Apple Strategy:**\n    *   The nearest apples are at (3, 5) and (6, 6). Moving LEFT puts me on the shortest path to collect these efficiently.\n\nConclusion: LEFT is the optimal move to approach the apple cluster while maintaining board center control.\n\nMove towards the central apples (6,6) and (3,5).\nLEFT",

Valid.\n    *   Conclusion: UP is a valid move.\n\n2.  **DOWN**: Target (5, 0).\n    *   Boundaries: (5, 0) is within 0-9. Valid.\n    *   Self Collision: My body is at (6, 1). (5, 0) is not in my body. Valid.\n    *   Enemy Collision: (5, 0) is not occupied by enemy body.

Moving RIGHT would move my head into my current body position. This is suicide.

So effectively 3 moves.\n    *   Path to (3, 5): Looks clear.\n\n*   **UP (5, 2):**\n    *   Proximity to apples:\n        *   Distance to (3, 5): |5-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n        *   Distance to (6, 6): |5-6| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n    *   Future options: (5, 2) allows moves to (4, 2), (6, 2), (5, 1) [my tail], (5, 3). 3 moves.\n    *   Path: This puts me closer to the vertical center and the apple at (5, 9).\n\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):**\n    *   Proximity to apples:\n        *   Distance to (3, 5): |5-3| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n        *   Distance to (6, 6): |5-6| + |0-6| = 1 + 6 = 7.\n    *   Future options: (5, 0) is on the bottom edge. Moves to (4, 0), (6, 0), (5, 1) [my tail]. Only 2 moves. This is cornering me.\n    *   Verdict: Bad move.\n\nSo, LEFT or UP.\n\nComparing LEFT (4, 1) and UP (5, 2):\n*   Both have similar distance to the nearest apples (5 turns).\n*   UP moves me directly between the paths to (6, 6) and (3, 5), keeping both options open immediately.\n*   LEFT commits me towards (3, 5) slightly more, but the distance to (6, 6) becomes 7 (2 more than UP).\n*   UP also allows an approach to the vertical column of apples at (5, 9) and (8, 9).\n*   UP avoids the potential dead end of moving down towards the bottom edge.\n\nTherefore, UP is the optimal move.\n\nMoving UP to get closer to the center and the apples at (6,6) and (5,9).\nUP",

(5, 3) is clear.\n        *   Enemy body is at (2, 5) and (1, 5). (5, 3) is clear.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves towards the center and the cluster of apples at (5, 9), (6, 6), and (7, 8). It maintains a path to the left side apples (3, 5) as well. It avoids the bottom edge which limits mobility.\n\n2.  **LEFT (4, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Is (4, 2) occupied?\n        *   Clear of my body.\n        *   Clear of enemy body.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the left side apples ((3, 5) and (6, 6)). However, this position is closer to the enemy snake at (2, 5). If the enemy moves Right, we might end up adjacent, but generally, moving towards the center is safer to keep options open against a single enemy.\n\n3.  **DOWN (5, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Is (5, 1) occupied?\n        *   **CRITICAL:** My body is at (5, 1). Moving DOWN puts my head into my current neck position. This is suicide.\n        *   **Result:** Invalid.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Is (6, 2) occupied?\n        *   Clear of my body.\n        *   Clear of enemy body.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the right side apples (6, 6), (7, 8), (8, 9). This is a valid move.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing **UP (5, 3)** vs **LEFT (4, 2)** vs **RIGHT (6, 2)**.\n- All are safe.\n- **UP (5, 3)** provides the best central position, balancing access to all apples. It puts me at x=5, y=3, which is a strong pivot point.\n- **RIGHT (6, 2)** moves towards the \"crowded\" right side where apples (6,6), (7,8), (8,9) are, but also potentially closer to the board edge if I go too far right. However, the right side has plenty of apples.\n- **LEFT (4, 2)** moves towards the left side.\n\nGiven the apple distribution, the right side has more apples, but the center (5, 3) is safer and allows pivoting to either side. However, looking closely at the coordinates:\n- (5, 9) is a straight shot up.\n- (6, 6) is to the right and up.\n- (3, 5) is left and up.\n\nThe **UP** move to (5, 3) is the most versatile. It avoids potential entrapment near the bottom edge and keeps the path to (5, 9) open, which is a \"low hanging fruit\" straight vertical line.\nWait, looking at the map again:\n`9 . . . . . A . . A .`\nRow 9 has apples at (5,9) and (8,9).\nRow 8 has an apple at (7,8).\nRow 6 has an apple at (6,6).\nRow 5 has an apple at (3,5).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 2), I am immediately closer to (6,6) and (7,8).\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 3), I am closer to (5,9).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 2), I am closer to (3,5).\n\nThe enemy is at (2, 5). This is to the left.\nGoing **LEFT** brings me closer to the enemy. This increases the risk of a head-on collision or being cut off. I should avoid moving directly towards the enemy if possible.\nGoing **RIGHT** moves me away from the enemy and towards the cluster of apples on the right.\nGoing **UP** moves me perpendicularly.\n\nBetween **RIGHT** and **UP**:\n- **RIGHT (6, 2)** leads to a dense apple cluster (6,6), (7,8), (8,9).\n- **UP (5, 3)** leads to (5,9) but then I have to turn right to get to the cluster.\n\nHowever, I must check my tail. My body is at (5, 1). If I move UP to (5, 2) (wait, current head is 5,2? No, the prompt says \"Head: (5, 2), Body: [(5, 1)]\"). Wait.\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (5, 2), Body: [(5, 1)]\".\nMy head is currently at (5, 2).\nThe moves I am considering are FROM (5, 2).\nSo:\n- UP: (5, 3)\n- DOWN: (5, 1) -> occupied by body (suicide).\n- LEFT: (4, 2)\n- RIGHT: (6, 2)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Last Move Information\" provided in the prompt. It says:\n\"My head is at (5, 1). My body is at (6, 1).\"\n\"I need to check... UP: Target (5, 2).\"\n\"**END LAST MOVE PICK** UP\"\n\nSo, the prompt shows that *last turn* I was at (5, 1) and moved UP to (5, 2).\nThis means the CURRENT state IS:\nHead: (5, 2)\nBody: [(5, 1)] (The previous head position).\n\nSo my analysis above is correct for the current state (Head 5,2).\n\nRe-evaluating **RIGHT (6, 2)** vs **UP (5, 3)**:\n**RIGHT (6, 2)**:\n- Moves towards the right side cluster (6,6), (7,8), (8,9).\n- Distance to (6,6) is 4 moves (Manhattan). Distance to (7,8) is roughly 7 moves.\n- This is a very strong direction.\n- Is (6, 2) safe? Yes.\n\n**UP (5, 3)**:\n- Moves towards (5, 9).\n- Distance to (5, 9) is 6 moves.\n- This is slightly slower to the nearest apple cluster compared to going RIGHT towards (6, 6).\n- Also, (5, 3) is safer long-term? Not necessarily. (6, 2) is safe.\n\nWhy did I consider UP \"more versatile\"?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committing to the right side.\nIf I go UP, I can still go LEFT or RIGHT later.\nHowever, the right side has *more* apples.\n(6,6), (7,8), (8,9) are 3 apples.\n(5,9) is 1 apple.\n(3,5) is 1 apple.\nRight side is the objective.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (2, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I am far away. Safe.\nIf I go UP to (5, 3), I am somewhat close (distance 5). Still safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 2), I am distance 4. Still safe, but riskier interaction.\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing **RIGHT** to (6, 2) is the best move to pursue the dense apple cluster on the right side. It is safe and puts me on a direct path to (6, 6).\nWait, looking at the board state again.\nRow 2 is mostly empty.\n`2 . . . . . 0 . . . .`\nCurrently `0` is at (5,2).\nMoving RIGHT puts me at (6,2).\nRow 2: `. . . . . . 0 . . .`\nThis looks clear.\nLet's check the path to (6,6).\nFrom (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6).\nRow 5: `. T 1 A . . . . . .`\nRow 5 has an enemy body at (1,5) and (2,5) (Wait, head is (2,5), body is (1,5)).\nSo (5,5) is empty.\nThe path `(6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6)` seems clear.\nTherefore, going RIGHT is a very strong play.\n\nLet's double check UP vs RIGHT one last time.\n**RIGHT**:\n- Pros: Moves towards the apple cluster (6,6), (7,8), (8,9). Fastest route to points.\n- Cons: Slightly reduces flexibility to go Left (but I don't want to go Left towards enemy).\n**UP**:\n- Pros: Central position.\n- Cons: Slower to the right side cluster. If I go UP now, I might end up at (5,3), then next turn I go RIGHT to (6,3), then I am on the same path as if I went RIGHT now but one turn delayed.\n\nSo, **RIGHT** is objectively better for scoring apples.\n\nLet's check if there are any immediate threats if I go RIGHT.\nEnemy at (2, 5). Enemy is moving.\nIf enemy moves UP, they go to (2, 6). Still far.\nIf enemy moves Right, they go to (3, 5). Wait, there is an apple at (3, 5).\nSo the enemy is likely to move Right to (3, 5) to eat the apple.\nIf enemy goes to (3, 5), and I am at (6, 2), we are far apart.\nNo collision risk.\n\nWait, I must ensure I am not moving into a trap.\nIs (6, 2) safe? Yes.\nIs (6, 3) safe? Yes.\nIs (6, 4) safe? Yes.\nIs (6, 5) safe? Yes. (Row 5 has apple at (6,5)? No, row 5 is `. T 1 A . . . . . .`. A is at (3,5). So (6,5) is empty.)\nIs (6, 6) safe? Yes (Apple).\n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the optimal move.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy head is at (5, 2). My body is at (5, 1).\nI need to check the validity of moving UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP**: Target (5, 3).\n    *   Boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Self Collision: Clear (Body at 5,1).\n    *   Enemy Collision: Clear.\n    *   Conclusion: Valid.\n\n2.  **DOWN**: Target (5, 1).\n    *   Boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Self Collision: **INVALID**. My body is currently at (5, 1). Moving down moves my head into my neck.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (4, 2).\n    *   Boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Self Collision: Clear.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Clear.\n    *   Conclusion: Valid.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target (6, 2).\n    *   Boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Self Collision: Clear.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Clear.\n    *   Conclusion: Valid.\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):** Moves towards the apple at (3, 5) but brings me closer to the enemy snake at (2, 5). This is risky.\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Moves towards the center. This provides access to the vertical apple at (5, 9) but is slower to reach the dense cluster of apples on the right side.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Moves directly towards the right-side apple cluster at (6, 6), (7, 8), and (8, 9). The path from (6, 2) to (6, 6) appears clear of obstacles. This is the most efficient path to gaining a score lead.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to pursue the nearest and densest cluster of apples, keeping a safe distance from the enemy.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is currently at `(4, 5)`, which is relatively close. However, there is an apple at `(5, 9)` eventually. Not the most immediate priority compared to the cluster at `(6, 6)`.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (Target: (7, 3)):**\n        *   *Safety:* Check `(7, 3)`.\n            *   Is it on board?

My body is at `[(6, 4)]`.\n2.  **Board & Obstacles:**\n    *   **My Body:** `(6, 4)` is directly below my head. `DOWN` is lethal.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(5, 6)`, Body at `[(5, 5), (4, 5)]`. This snake is currently directly adjacent to my head (North-West). He has collected 2 apples.\n    *   **Apples:** `(6, 6)` is directly North. `(7, 7)` is North-East.\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (6, 6):** Safe. Moves me onto an apple. Snake #1's head is at `(5, 6)`. He could potentially move to `(6, 6)` this turn (his East). If he does, it's a head-on collision, and we both die. However, if he wants to survive, he must avoid hitting me. He has other options (North, West). If he goes North, I get the apple safely. If he commits suicide against me, I die, but it's a 50/50 risk on his part. If I *don't* go up, I miss the apple and likely lose the race for the cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe.

My body is there.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe highest reward is the apple at `(6, 6)`. While there is a risk of a head-on collision with Snake #1 if he decides to move `RIGHT` to `(6, 6)`, staying back does not improve my position. The game is currently 1-2, and I need apples to catch up. I will move **UP** to claim the apple and force Snake #1 to yield or commit suicide.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move `UP` to `(6, 6)` to eat the apple.\n2.  If Snake #1 moves to `(6, 6)` as well (unlikely if he plays to win), we both die.\n3.  If he moves `NORTH` or avoids me, I will be at `(6, 6)` with length 3.\n4.  Next target will likely be `(7, 7)` or `(5, 9)` depending on Snake #1's new position.\n\nUP",

He cannot reach `(7, 8)` this turn. However, the cell `(7, 8)` is currently empty. Is it blocked? No. Let's check the \"Head-on collision\" rule. If Snake #1 moves `RIGHT` and I move `UP`, we are at different cells. So it is physically safe to move there. However, Snake #1 is at `(5, 9)`. He might want the apple at `(5, 9)` (wait, is there an apple at `(5, 9)`? The list says `(5, 9)` is **not** an apple. The apples are `(7, 8)`, `(8, 9)`, `(4, 7)`, `(2, 4)`, `(1, 1)`. So Snake #1 at `(5, 9)` is just roaming. He is very close. If I move UP to `(7, 8)`, I will be right next to him if he moves right. If he moves right to `(6, 9)` and I move up to `(7, 8)`, the distance is 1 step diagonal. If he moves `DOWN` to `(5, 8)`, he is safe.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 7):** **UNSAFE.** My body.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 7):** **SAFE.** Currently empty.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 6):** **SAFE.** Currently empty.\n\n    *Re-evaluating UP (7, 8):* There is an apple at `(7, 8)`. Eating it grows me. This is a standard goal. Snake #1 at `(5, 9)` is a threat. If I move UP, and he moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)`, I am at `(7, 8)`. He is at `(6, 9)`. They are adjacent diagonal. If I stay at `(7, 7)` and he moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)`, we are far apart. If I move UP, I expose my flank. However, the apple is valuable.\n    \n    Let's look at **RIGHT (8, 7)**. This is safe. It moves towards the apple at `(8, 9)`. It keeps distance from Snake #1 at `(5, 9)`.\n    \n    Let's look at **DOWN (7, 6)**. This is safe. My tail is at `(6, 5)`. If I move DOWN, I move away from Snake #1.\n\n    **Comparing UP vs RIGHT vs DOWN:**\n    *   **UP (7, 8):** High risk (proximity to Snake #1), High reward (Eats apple, grows).\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Low risk, Medium reward (moves toward `(8, 9)`).\n    *   **DOWN (7, 6):** Low risk, Low reward (moves away from apples).\n\n    **Strategy:** \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open.\"\n    \n    Let's re-check the \"Head-on collision\" rule for UP. Snake #1 is at `(5, 9)`. I am at `(7, 7)`. The apple is at `(7, 8)`.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 8)`.\n    If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)`.\n    Result: No collision. I am at `(7, 8)`, he is at `(6, 9)`.\n    If Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(5, 8)`.\n    Result: No collision. I am at `(7, 8)`, he is at `(5, 8)`.\n    \n    Is there a scenario where we collide? No, because we are 2 units away X and 2 units away Y. He cannot cover that distance in one turn.\n    \n    So, **UP is actually SAFE** regarding collision with Snake #1. The only danger is if he moves to a cell I move into, which is impossible given the distance.\n    \n    So, UP is a safe move that gains an apple. This is the best move.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board again:\n    `9 . . . . . 1 . . A .`\n    `8 . . . . . T . A . .`\n    `7 . . . . A T T 0 . .`\n    \n    My head is at `0` in the visualization at `(7, 7)`.\n    Apple is at `(7, 8)`.\n    Snake #1 is at `(5, 9)`.\n    \n    If I move UP to `(7, 8)`, I eat the apple. I grow. My tail will not move (because I ate).\n    If Snake #1 moves UP to `(5, 10)` -> Dead (Wall).\n    If Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(5, 8)` -> He hits his own body (which is at `(5, 8)` in the previous turn? No, his body is `[(5, 8), (5, 7)]`. Wait, his head is `(5, 9)`. His body is `(5, 8)`. So `DOWN` is lethal for him.\n    If Snake #1 moves LEFT to `(4, 9)` -> Safe.\n    If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)` -> Safe. (This puts him next to my potential position `(7, 8)`).\n    \n    So, Snake #1 is likely to move LEFT or RIGHT. He is unlikely to stay or move into his own body.\n    If he moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)` and I move UP to `(7, 8)`, we are adjacent. This is not a collision. It is just adjacency.\n    \n    Therefore, **UP** is the winning move. It eats the apple and sets up for the next apple at `(8, 9)`.\n\n    *Correction:* My tail is at `(6, 5)`. If I eat at `(7, 8)`, I grow. The tail stays at `(6, 5)`.\n    My new body: `[(7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]`.\n    Next turn, I can move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    \n    Let's double check if there is any immediate danger to UP.\n    Is `(7, 8)` currently occupied? No.\n    Is `(7, 8)` an apple? Yes.\n    Is moving there into my body? No.\n    Is it into enemy body? No.\n    Is it into enemy head (simultaneous)? Enemy is at `(5, 9)`. Distance is > 1.\n    \n    It seems **UP** is the best move.\n\n    *Wait, I must check the \"Head-on collision\" rule carefully.*\n    \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\n    My target: `(7, 8)`.\n    Enemy target: `(6, 9)`, `(4, 9)`, `(5, 8)`. None are `(7, 8)`.\n    \n    \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies...\"\n    If Snake #1 moves to `(7, 8)`? Impossible.\n    If Snake #1 moves to `(7, 7)`? Impossible.\n    \n    **UP is safe and beneficial.**\n\n    **Plan:**\n    1.  Move UP to `(7, 8)` and eat the apple.\n    2.  Prepare to move RIGHT to `(8, 8)` or UP to `(7, 9)` to chase `(8, 9)`.\n    3.  Keep monitoring Snake #1 at `(5, 9)`.\n\n    One final check on `RIGHT (8, 7)`.\n    If I move RIGHT, I don't eat an apple. The apple is at `(7, 8)` and `(8, 9)`.\n    If I move RIGHT, I am at `(8, 7)`.\n    Then I can move UP to `(8, 8)`.\n    Then UP to `(8, 9)` to eat.\n    This is a longer route.\n    Going UP now eats immediately.\n    \n    The only reason not to go UP is if Snake #1 can block me or kill me. He cannot.\n    \n    So, UP.\n\n    *Self-Correction:* The prompt says \"Avoid likely head-on collisions\".\n    Is it \"likely\" Snake #1 moves to `(6, 9)`? Yes.\n    Is it \"likely\" I move to `(7, 8)`? Yes.\n    Are these the same cell? No.\n    Is it \"likely\" Snake #1 moves to `(7, 8)`? No.\n    \n    So, clear path.\n\n    Final decision: UP.\n\n    *Long-term plan:* Secure apples in the top-right quadrant `(7,8), (8,9)`. Be wary of Snake #1 in the top-left. If he gets stuck or dies, I own the board.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n    `9 . . . . . 1 . . A .`\n    `8 . . . . . T . A . .`\n    \n    The `1` is at `(5, 9)`.\n    The `T` (tail) is at `(5, 8)`.\n    The `A` (apple) is at `(8, 9)`.\n    \n    My head is at `(7, 7)`.\n    The `A` (apple) is at `(7, 8)`.\n    \n    It seems correct.\n\n    Wait, I should check if `(6, 8)` is safe if I were to go there. I am not going there, but knowing the environment helps.\n    `(6, 8)` is North of `(6, 7)`. It is empty.\n    \n    Is there any trap?\n    If I go UP to `(7, 8)`, I am blocked on the right by `(8, 8)` (empty) and on the left by `(6, 8)` (empty).\n    If I go UP, I am blocked on the top by `(7, 9)` (empty).\n    \n    If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to `(6, 9)`, he is adjacent to `(7, 9)`.\n    If I go UP to `(7, 8)`, I am adjacent to `(6, 8)`.\n    \n    It seems I am safe.\n\n    The only \"Deadly\" move is if I go UP and he goes DOWN to `(5, 8)`? No, his body is there.\n    If he goes LEFT to `(4, 9)`? Fine.\n    \n    I am confident in UP.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I successfully moved UP last turn and ate the apple at `(7, 8)`.\n2.  **Board & Obstacles:**\n    *   **My Body:** My body starts directly behind me at `(7, 7)`. Moving DOWN is lethal.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(6, 9)`. Body at `[(5, 9), (5, 8)]`. He moved RIGHT to `(6, 9)`.\n    *   **Apples:** The apple at `(7, 8)` is gone (eaten by me). The remaining apples are `(8, 9)`, `(4, 7)`, `(2, 4)`, `(1, 1)`.\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (7, 9):**\n        *   Coordinates: `(7, 9)` is on the board.\n        *   Own Body: `(7, 9)` is empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Body: `(7, 9)` is empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Head: Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`. Distance is 1 (adjacent).\n        *   Collision Risk: If Snake #1 moves UP to `(6, 10)`, he dies (wall). If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, he is safe. If he moves LEFT to `(5, 9)`, he is safe (his body is at `(5, 9)`, wait, his body is `[(5, 9), (5, 8)]`. His *tail* is at `(5, 8)`. His body is `[(5, 9), (5, 8)]`. If he moves LEFT to `(5, 9)`, he enters the cell currently occupied by his own body `(5, 9)`. This is lethal for him. So he likely won't move LEFT. He can move DOWN or RIGHT (blocked by wall). So he is likely to move DOWN.\n        *   If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)` and I move UP to `(7, 9)`, we are diagonal neighbors. No collision.\n        *   Apple: No apple at `(7, 9)`.\n        *   Future: Moves me towards `(8, 9)`.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 8):**\n        *   Coordinates: `(8, 8)` is on the board.\n        *   Own Body: Empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Body: Empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Head: Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`. Distance is large.\n        *   Apple: No apple at `(8, 8)`.\n        *   Future: Moves me towards `(8, 9)`.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 8):**\n        *   Coordinates: `(6, 8)` is on the board.\n        *   Own Body: Empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Body: Snake #1 body is at `(5, 9)` and `(5, 8)`. `(6, 8)` is empty. Safe.\n        *   Enemy Head: Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`. If I move LEFT to `(6, 8)` and he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, we collide. If he moves DOWN, we die.\n        *   Apple: No apple at `(6, 8)`.\n        *   Strategy: Moving LEFT is moving away from the remaining apples in the top-right corner. It also brings me close to the enemy head without gaining an advantage.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 7):** LETHAL. Into my own body.\n\n    **Comparison of UP vs RIGHT vs LEFT:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Brings me directly under the enemy head `(6, 9)`, risking a collision if he moves down. Moves away from the apple cluster. Bad choice.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Safe. Moves towards `(8, 9)`. Good.\n    *   **UP:** Safe (if enemy moves down, we are diagonal; if enemy moves left, he dies). Moves towards `(8, 9)`. Good.\n\n    **Decision:**\n    Comparing UP and RIGHT:\n    I want to reach `(8, 9)` to eat the apple.\n    From `(7, 8)`:\n    Option 1: UP to `(7, 9)`. Then RIGHT to `(8, 9)`. (2 turns)\n    Option 2: RIGHT to `(8, 8)`. Then UP to `(8, 9)`. (2 turns)\n    \n    I must account for Snake #1 at `(6, 9)`.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I am adjacent to him `(6, 9)`.\n    If he moves RIGHT (die) or UP (die), he dies.\n    If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, I am at `(7, 9)`. Safe.\n    If he moves LEFT (die), he dies.\n    So he likely moves DOWN.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am at `(8, 8)`.\n    Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`. He is far.\n    \n    Is there any danger to moving UP?\n    If Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, I am at `(7, 9)`. We are safe.\n    If Snake #1 somehow moves to `(7, 9)`? Impossible (distance 2).\n    \n    Is there any danger to moving RIGHT?\n    No.\n    \n    Both are safe.\n    However, **UP** puts pressure on Snake #1. It forces him to move DOWN or die. Moving DOWN puts him at `(6, 8)`.\n    If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, and I am at `(7, 9)`.\n    Next turn, I can move to `(8, 9)` (Eat Apple).\n    He is at `(6, 8)`. He is far away.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    Next turn, I can move to `(8, 9)` (Eat Apple).\n    He is at `(6, 9)`.\n    \n    Moving UP (North) is generally better in the \"head-to-head\" proximity because it asserts dominance. If he stays at `(6, 9)` and I move UP, he has 0 safe moves (Left/Right/Up are walls or his body; Down is only safe).\n    \n    Let's re-verify \"Head-on collision\".\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)` and he moves UP to `(6, 10)` -> He hits wall. He dies. I live.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)` and he moves RIGHT to `(7, 9)` -> Impossible (Distance 2).\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)` and he moves UP to `(6, 10)` -> He hits wall. He dies.\n    \n    I want to claim the apple at `(8, 9)`.\n    Moving UP gets me to `(7, 9)`.\n    Moving RIGHT gets me to `(8, 8)`.\n    Both are one step away from the apple.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`.\n    My head is at `(7, 8)`.\n    Apple at `(8, 9)`.\n    \n    If I move UP:\n    Me: `(7, 9)`.\n    Him: Likely `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn: I eat `(8, 9)`.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT:\n    Me: `(8, 8)`.\n    Him: `(6, 9)` (if he stays) or `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn: I eat `(8, 9)` from `(8, 8)`.\n    \n    Wait, if I am at `(8, 8)`, I can eat `(8, 9)` by moving UP.\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`, I can eat `(8, 9)` by moving RIGHT.\n    \n    Is there a reason to prefer one over the other?\n    Let's consider the \"Corner\" risk.\n    `(8, 9)` is the top-right corner.\n    If I eat it from `(8, 8)` (by moving UP), I will be at `(8, 9)`. My tail will stay at `(6, 5)` (I ate, so I grow).\n    Then I am in the corner. Next moves: LEFT or DOWN. LEFT is `(7, 9)`. DOWN is `(8, 8)`.\n    If Snake #1 is alive and blocking `(7, 9)`, I might be trapped. But he is far.\n    \n    If I eat it from `(7, 9)` (by moving RIGHT), I will be at `(8, 9)`.\n    Same situation.\n    \n    Let's look at the blocking potential.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`.\n    And Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn: I move RIGHT to `(8, 9)`.\n    He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    He cannot block me.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    And Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn: I move UP to `(8, 9)`.\n    He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    He cannot block me.\n    \n    There is a specific interaction to check:\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`:\n    Is it possible Snake #1 moves RIGHT to `(7, 9)`? No, distance 2.\n    Is it possible Snake #1 moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`? Yes.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`:\n    Is it possible Snake #1 moves... No.\n    \n    Let's consider **Head-on collision** again.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`.\n    He moves UP to `(6, 10)`. He dies (Wall). I live.\n    He moves LEFT to `(5, 9)`. He dies (Own Body). I live.\n    He moves RIGHT to `(7, 9)`. Impossible.\n    He moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`. We are safe.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    He moves UP to `(6, 10)`. He dies. I live.\n    ...\n    \n    Wait, is there a scenario where I die?\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`.\n    If Snake #1 moves... there is no move that puts him at `(7, 9)`.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    If Snake #1 moves... there is no move that puts him at `(8, 8)`.\n    \n    Both are safe.\n    \n    However, I want to maximize my \"future options\".\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I am blocking the cell `(7, 9)` which is adjacent to Snake #1's potential path. He is at `(6, 9)`. He is forced to move DOWN or die.\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am not blocking his path. He can stay at `(6, 9)` if he wants (though it's a bad spot for him, it's legal).\n    \n    By moving UP, I assert pressure. I force him to move.\n    Also, moving UP leaves `(8, 8)` open. Moving RIGHT leaves `(7, 9)` open.\n    `(7, 9)` is adjacent to `(6, 9)`. If I don't occupy `(7, 9)`, he might move there? No, he is at `(6, 9)`. He cannot reach `(7, 9)` in one turn.\n    \n    Okay, they are functionally equivalent for this turn.\n    But:\n    Moving UP brings me closer to the vertical coordinate of the apple `(8, 9)`.\n    Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the horizontal coordinate.\n    \n    Let's check the \"Snake #1\" safety again.\n    Snake #1 at `(6, 9)`.\n    His body is `[(5, 9), (5, 8)]`.\n    He is effectively trapped in a box if he moves wrong.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I stand at his \"door\".\n    If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, he is safe.\n    If he stays, he dies (blocked by me/walls/body).\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, he is not pressured. He can just move DOWN and be fine.\n    \n    Actually, I should not worry about killing him this turn unless I can do it safely. I should focus on the apple.\n    \n    Is there a preference?\n    Let's assume he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)` (the only safe move if I don't kill him).\n    State A: I am at `(7, 9)`. He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    State B: I am at `(8, 8)`. He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    \n    From A: I eat apple `(8, 9)` next turn.\n    From B: I eat apple `(8, 9)` next turn.\n    \n    Let's look at the board after eating.\n    If I am at `(8, 9)` (Eaten from `7,9`):\n    My body is `[(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    Next moves: `LEFT (7, 9)` (Body), `DOWN (8, 8)` (Safe). `RIGHT` (Wall). `UP` (Wall).\n    I must go DOWN to `(8, 8)`.\n    \n    If I am at `(8, 9)` (Eaten from `8,8`):\n    My body is `[(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    Next moves: `LEFT (7, 9)` (Safe), `DOWN (8, 8)` (Body). `RIGHT` (Wall). `UP` (Wall).\n    I must go LEFT to `(7, 9)`.\n    \n    If I am at `(8, 9)`, I will be in the corner.\n    Snake #1 is at `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn, I am forced to either `LEFT` or `DOWN`.\n    If I go `LEFT` to `(7, 9)`, I am near Snake #1 `(6, 8)`.\n    If I go `DOWN` to `(8, 8)`, I am away from him.\n    \n    If I am at `(7, 9)` (before eating):\n    Next turn I eat at `(8, 9)`.\n    Then I am in the corner.\n    \n    It seems the path matters less than the safety.\n    \n    Let's re-verify **LEFT**.\n    LEFT to `(6, 8)`.\n    Snake #1 is at `(6, 9)`.\n    If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, we collide. Both die.\n    If he moves DOWN, I die. He dies. Game over (I have 5 apples, he has 3). I win if we die simultaneously?\n    \"If all snakes die on the same turn ... the snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n    I have 4 apples. He has 3 apples. I just ate? No, I ate *last* turn.\n    Current apples: Me: 4, Him: 3.\n    If we both die this turn, I win (4 > 3).\n    Is he likely to move DOWN?\n    He is at `(6, 9)`.\n    Up: Wall.\n    Left: His body `(5, 9)`.\n    Right: Wall.\n    Down: `(6, 8)`.\n    **Snake #1 has ONLY one move: DOWN to `(6, 8)` or DIE.**\n    \n    Therefore, **Snake #1 will move DOWN to `(6, 8)`**.\n    \n    If I move **LEFT** to `(6, 8)`:\n    My target: `(6, 8)`.\n    His target: `(6, 8)`.\n    **Head-on Collision.**\n    Result: Both die.\n    I win (4 apples vs 3).\n    \n    If I move **UP** to `(7, 9)`:\n    My target: `(7, 9)`.\n    His target: `(6, 8)`.\n    Result: I live, He lives.\n    \n    If I move **RIGHT** to `(8, 8)`:\n    Result: I live, He lives.\n    \n    Wait, is `LEFT` a suicide move?\n    I move into `(6, 8)`.\n    He moves into `(6, 8)`.\n    \"If two snake heads move into the same cell ... both snakes die.\"\n    \"If all snakes die ... the snake with more apples wins.\"\n    Me: 4 apples. Him: 3 apples. I win.\n    \n    This looks like a winning play. I kill the enemy and survive? No, I die too.\n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    \n    Wait, the rule says: \"If all snakes die on the same turn ... the snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n    If I die, do I win?\n    Yes, if we all die, the winner is decided by apples.\n    BUT, \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    This is a conflicting instruction.\n    Let's prioritize \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    If I choose LEFT, I die.\n    If I choose UP, I live.\n    \n    However, if I kill the enemy (by forcing him to crash or by colliding), I might win *even if I die*?\n    Let's look at the specific text:\n    \"If all snakes die on the same turn ... the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\"\n    \"Objective and strategy: You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    \n    This usually implies I should prioritize survival. A \"mutual destruction\" victory is usually not the goal in these prompts unless specified as a valid win condition. \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is a strong hint to stay alive.\n    \n    So, let's discard **LEFT** as too risky (suicide), even if it kills the enemy.\n    \n    Now, comparing **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n    Snake #1 MUST move DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    \n    If I move **UP** to `(7, 9)`:\n    I am at `(7, 9)`. He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    We are diagonal.\n    Next turn: I can eat `(8, 9)` (RIGHT).\n    \n    If I move **RIGHT** to `(8, 8)`:\n    I am at `(8, 8)`. He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    We are vertical neighbors (distance 2).\n    Next turn: I can eat `(8, 9)` (UP).\n    \n    Both paths allow me to eat the apple next turn without immediate danger from him.\n    \n    Is there a trap?\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`:\n    My body: `[(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]`.\n    Enemy at `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn I move RIGHT to `(8, 9)`.\n    My body: `[(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    Enemy at `(6, 8)`.\n    \n    If I am at `(8, 8)`:\n    My body: `[(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 7), ...]`.\n    Enemy at `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn I move UP to `(8, 9)`.\n    My body: `[(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    Enemy at `(6, 8)`.\n    \n    Wait, look at the board state provided again.\n    Snake #1 body: `[(5, 9), (5, 8)]`.\n    If he moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`, is `(6, 8)` free?\n    Yes.\n    \n    Is there any reason to prefer one over the other?\n    If I go UP to `(7, 9)`, I am blocking the cell `7,9`.\n    If I go RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am blocking `8,8`.\n    \n    Let's look at the turn count. Turn 14/150.\n    The board is large. There are other apples.\n    \n    If I am at `(7, 9)`:\n    Next turn at `(8, 9)` (Eaten).\n    Then I am at `(8, 9)`. I must move LEFT or DOWN.\n    If I move DOWN to `(8, 8)`, I am safe.\n    \n    If I am at `(8, 8)`:\n    Next turn at `(8, 9)` (Eaten).\n    Then I am at `(8, 9)`. I must move LEFT or DOWN.\n    If I move LEFT to `(7, 9)`, I am safe.\n    \n    It seems I am stuck in the corner after eating.\n    But I have 140+ turns left.\n    Being stuck in the corner is bad.\n    However, eating an apple is good.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Blockade\" idea.\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`.\n    Enemy is at `(6, 8)`.\n    Can he trap me?\n    He can move to `(7, 8)`? That is my body (I moved from there).\n    He can move to `(6, 9)`? That is blocked by his body or wall.\n    He can move to `(5, 8)`? His body.\n    He can move to `(6, 7)`?\n    If he moves to `(6, 7)`, he is close to my old body.\n    \n    Let's check the \"Future Options\".\n    Moving **UP** to `(7, 9)` puts me in the corner, but I can still eat the apple.\n    Moving **RIGHT** to `(8, 8)` puts me closer to the apple, but still not in the corner.\n    \n    Actually, `(8, 8)` is safer than `(7, 9)`?\n    `(7, 9)` is adjacent to `(6, 9)` (Enemy head location) and `(6, 8)` (Enemy target).\n    `(8, 8)` is further away.\n    \n    Let's assume the best move is the one that avoids the corner as long as possible.\n    I want to eat the apple at `(8, 9)`.\n    From `(7, 8)`:\n    Option A: UP -> `(7, 9)`. Next: RIGHT -> `(8, 9)`. I am in corner.\n    Option B: RIGHT -> `(8, 8)`. Next: UP -> `(8, 9)`. I am in corner.\n    \n    Option C: LEFT -> `(6, 8)`. Collision with Enemy. Both die. I win on points? \"You cannot win if you are dead.\" -> Rejected.\n    \n    Option D: DOWN. Suicide. Rejected.\n    \n    Is there a way to eat the apple *without* entering the corner?\n    No. The apple is at `(8, 9)` (Corner).\n    \n    Okay, both A and B end in the corner.\n    Is there a difference in the outcome?\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`:\n    I have eaten the apple.\n    Next turn I move RIGHT to `(8, 9)` (Eaten). Wait, I already ate at `(7, 8)`? No.\n    Wait, I am at `(7, 8)`. I didn't eat this turn (I ate last turn).\n    I want to eat `(8, 9)`.\n    \n    Path A: `7,8` -> `7,9` -> `8,9` (Eat).\n    Path B: `7,8` -> `8,8` -> `8,9` (Eat).\n    \n    After eating at `8,9`, I will be in the corner.\n    Next move: `LEFT` (to `7,9`) or `DOWN` (to `8,8`).\n    \n    Let's check the \"Cut off\" potential.\n    If I go Path A:\n    1. Move UP to `7,9`.\n    2. Move RIGHT to `8,9` (Eat). My tail grows. Old tail `6,5` stays.\n    3. Move DOWN to `8,8` (Backtrack). OR LEFT to `7,9` (Body).\n    My body: `[(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]`.\n    If I move DOWN to `8,8`, my body is `[(8,8), (8,9), ...]`.\n    If I move LEFT to `7,9`, I hit my own body (at `7,9`).\n    So I MUST move DOWN to `8,8`.\n    \n    If I go Path B:\n    1. Move RIGHT to `8,8`.\n    2. Move UP to `8,9` (Eat). My tail grows.\n    3. Move DOWN to `8,8` (Body) OR LEFT to `7,9`.\n    I MUST move LEFT to `7,9`.\n    \n    Okay, both paths force me out of the corner immediately after eating.\n    Path A forces me DOWN.\n    Path B forces me LEFT.\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy position again.\n    Enemy at `6,9` -> Moves DOWN to `6,8`.\n    Enemy body: `5,9`, `5,8`.\n    \n    If I take Path A:\n    I am at `7,9`.\n    Enemy at `6,8`.\n    Next turn I eat at `8,9`.\n    Enemy at `6,8` -> Can move to `6,7` or `5,8` or `7,8`.\n    `7,8` is my body (head `7,8` -> tail `6,5`).\n    `6,7` is empty.\n    `5,8` is his body.\n    So he can move to `6,7`.\n    \n    If I take Path B:\n    I am at `8,8`.\n    Enemy at `6,8`.\n    Next turn I eat at `8,9`.\n    Enemy at `6,8` -> Can move to `6,7`.\n    \n    There seems to be no major difference.\n    \n    However, let's look at the board state provided.\n    The board is generated based on *current* state.\n    My head is `(7, 8)`.\n    Enemy head `(6, 9)`.\n    \n    Is there a risk in moving RIGHT to `(8, 8)`?\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    Enemy moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn: I move UP to `(8, 9)` (Eat).\n    Enemy moves... `(6, 7)` maybe.\n    I move DOWN to `(8, 8)`.\n    Enemy moves... `(6, 6)` maybe.\n    \n    I am safe.\n    \n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    Apples: `(8, 9)`, `(4, 7)`, `(2, 4)`, `(1, 1)`.\n    \n    I am going for `(8, 9)`.\n    Is there any reason to go for `(4, 7)`?\n    `(4, 7)` is far away. Enemy is at `(6, 9)`. He is closer to `(4, 7)` than me? Yes.\n    \n    So I should eat `(8, 9)` and then clear the board.\n    \n    Let's reconsider `LEFT`.\n    If I move LEFT to `(6, 8)`.\n    Enemy moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    Both die.\n    My apples: 4. His apples: 3.\n    \"If all snakes die ... the snake with more apples ... wins.\"\n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    \n    This is the classic \"Is suicide a valid strategy?\" question.\n    Usually, in these LLM prompts, \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is the hard rule. If I die, I lose.\n    If I interpret \"If all snakes die\" as the *only* way I win while dead, then maybe.\n    But \"You cannot win if you are dead\" implies I must be alive to win.\n    So I should avoid mutual destruction.\n    \n    So, `LEFT` is out.\n    \n    Now `UP` vs `RIGHT`.\n    Let's check the \"Head-on collision\" probability.\n    `UP`: Target `(7, 9)`. Enemy Target `(6, 8)`. Safe.\n    `RIGHT`: Target `(8, 8)`. Enemy Target `(6, 8)`. Safe.\n    \n    Let's check the \"Squeeze\" potential.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I am one step away from the wall.\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am one step away from the wall.\n    \n    Wait, looking at the board:\n    `9 . . . . . T 1 . A .`\n    `8 . . . . . T . A . .`\n    \n    The `T`s represent the enemy body.\n    `1` is the enemy head.\n    `A` is the apple.\n    \n    If I move UP:\n    `9 . . . . . T 1 0 A .` (Hypothetical next turn board)\n    My head `0` is at `7,9`.\n    Enemy head `1` is at `6,8`.\n    \n    If I move RIGHT:\n    `9 . . . . . T 1 . A .`\n    `8 . . . . . T . 0 . .`\n    My head `0` is at `8,8`.\n    Enemy head `1` is at `6,8`.\n    \n    Is there any difference in the \"Option Space\"?\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`, I have 1 move to the apple `(8, 9)` (RIGHT).\n    If I am at `(8, 8)`, I have 1 move to the apple `(8, 9)` (UP).\n    \n    Wait, if I am at `(8, 8)`:\n    I can also move LEFT to `(7, 8)` (which is my old spot).\n    \n    If I am at `(7, 9)`:\n    I can also move DOWN to `(7, 8)` (old spot).\n    \n    They are symmetric.\n    \n    However, there is a subtle detail.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I am moving into the corner.\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am *near* the corner but not in it.\n    `(8, 8)` allows me to move UP to eat, or LEFT to retreat.\n    `(7, 9)` allows me to move RIGHT to eat, or DOWN to retreat.\n    \n    Usually, being in the corner `(7, 9)` is slightly worse than `(8, 8)` because `(8, 8)` has a \"backdoor\" to the open board via `LEFT`.\n    Wait, `(7, 9)` has `DOWN` to `(7, 8)` which leads to the open board.\n    `(8, 8)` has `LEFT` to `(7, 8)` which leads to the open board.\n    \n    It is symmetric.\n    \n    BUT, if I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, and the enemy somehow moves to `(7, 8)`? No, he is at `6, 9`.\n    \n    Let's look at the coordinates again.\n    Enemy at `(6, 9)`.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`.\n    Distance to enemy is 1 (Diagonal).\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    Distance to enemy is sqrt(2) + 1 approx. He is further away.\n    \n    Actually, let's look at the apple at `(8, 9)`.\n    If I am at `(8, 8)`, I am \"shielding\" the apple from the left side.\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`, I am \"shielding\" the apple from the bottom side.\n    \n    The enemy is at `(6, 9)`.\n    He is \"North\" of me.\n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`, I am moving towards him.\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am moving away from him (X-axis).\n    \n    Generally, moving *away* from an enemy is safer than moving *towards* them.\n    Even if I can't collide this turn, moving towards them limits my future escape routes.\n    If I am at `(7, 9)`, my escape is only `(7, 8)`.\n    If I am at `(8, 8)`, my escape is `(7, 8)` or `(8, 7)`.\n    \n    Wait, `(8, 7)` is empty. `(7, 8)` is occupied by my body (until I move).\n    If I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`:\n    My body becomes `[(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]`.\n    Next turn I can move UP to `(8, 9)` (Eat).\n    Or I can move DOWN to `(8, 7)`.\n    Or I can move LEFT to `(7, 8)` (Body).\n    \n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`:\n    My body becomes `[(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]`.\n    Next turn I can move RIGHT to `(8, 9)` (Eat).\n    Or I can move DOWN to `(7, 8)` (Body).\n    \n    So `(8, 8)` gives me an extra escape route `(8, 7)`.\n    `(7, 9)` gives me NO extra escape route.\n    \n    Therefore, **RIGHT** is safer for future options.\n    \n    Also, \"Keep future options open\".\n    Moving RIGHT to `(8, 8)` leaves `(7, 9)` open. `(7, 9)` is adjacent to `(6, 9)`. If the enemy wants to commit suicide, he can, but it doesn't affect me.\n    \n    Moving UP to `(7, 9)` occupies `(7, 9)`. It doesn't change much.\n    \n    But wait, if I move RIGHT to `(8, 8)`.\n    And I eat the apple next turn at `(8, 9)`.\n    My body is `[(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    I can then move DOWN to `(8, 7)`.\n    `(8, 7)` is empty.\n    I can then move LEFT to `(7, 7)`.\n    \n    If I move UP to `(7, 9)`.\n    Eat at `(8, 9)`.\n    Body: `[(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), ...]`.\n    I can move DOWN to `(8, 8)`? No, `(8, 8)` is empty.\n    I can move LEFT to `(7, 9)`? No, body.\n    I can move DOWN to `(8, 8)`? Yes, `(8, 8)` is empty.\n    Wait, if I am at `(8, 9)`, `DOWN` is `(8, 8)`.\n    \n    So both lead to `(8, 8)` eventually.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the \"Head-on collision\" with `LEFT`.\n    If I move LEFT to `(6, 8)`.\n    Enemy moves DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\n    Both die.\n    I win on points.\n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    This is the confusing part.\n    Usually, \"You cannot win if you are dead\" means \"Don't commit suicide\".\n    But \"If all snakes die ... the snake with more apples wins\" is a specific win condition.\n    If I kill the enemy, I am the sole survivor (if I survive) or I win on points (if we die).\n    If I move LEFT, I die.\n    If I die, I cannot control the snake. The game ends.\n    If the game ends and I have more apples, I win.\n    So, do I win?\n    Usually yes. But the prompt says \"You cannot win if you are dead\".\n    This is likely a \"safety instruction\" to prevent the LLM from making bad suicide moves.\n    However, if the suicide move kills the *only* enemy, it's a valid strategy.\n    \n    Let's look at the score.\n    Me: 4 apples. Him: 3 apples.\n    If we both die, I win (4 > 3).\n    Is he forced to die?\n    Yes, he has no safe moves except DOWN.\n    If I move LEFT, he moves DOWN. We collide. Both die.\n    I win.\n    \n    Is there any scenario where I die and he lives?\n    If I move LEFT, I die. If he moves UP (Wall), he dies. If he moves LEFT (Body), he dies. If he moves RIGHT (Wall), he dies.\n    He *must* move DOWN or die.\n    So if I move LEFT, he *must* move DOWN.\n    Collision -> Both die.\n    \n    Is there a scenario where I die and he dies, but it's a draw? (e.g. 4 apples vs 4 apples).\n    No, he has 3.\n    \n    So, `LEFT` guarantees a win (on points).\n    `UP` or `RIGHT` guarantees survival, but risks the enemy surviving and potentially blocking me or stealing apples later.\n    \n    However, \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    If I die, I lose control. If the rules say \"You win if apples > opponent\", then I win.\n    But if the rule \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is absolute, then I lose.\n    \n    In most snake games, suicide is bad. But if it kills the opponent and wins the game, it's good.\n    Let's assume \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is a guideline, but the specific rule \"If all snakes die ... snake with more apples wins\" overrides it for the win condition.\n    BUT, if I strictly follow \"You cannot win if you are dead\", I should avoid `LEFT`.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Long-term plan\".\n    I have 140 turns.\n    Killing the enemy now removes a threat.\n    If I don't kill him, he might go to `(4, 7)` or `(2, 4)`.\n    If I kill him now, I own the board.\n    \n    Is `LEFT` suicide?\n    Yes.\n    Is it a winning move?\n    Yes, because it kills the enemy.\n    \n    Let's check the \"Head-on collision\" rule again.\n    \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\n    \"If all snakes die on the same turn ... the snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n    \n    So, `LEFT` -> `6,8`. Enemy `DOWN` -> `6,8`. Both die. I win.\n    \n    Why would the prompt say \"You cannot win if you are dead\" then?\n    Maybe to prevent me from making a bad suicide move that *doesn't* win the game.\n    If I move DOWN, I die. He lives. I lose.\n    If I move LEFT, I die. He dies. I win.\n    \n    So `LEFT` is the winning move.\n    \n    Wait, is there a catch?\n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    If I am dead, I have won.\n    Contradiction?\n    Maybe it means \"You cannot guarantee a win if you are dead\".\n    Or \"You cannot win *the next turn* if you are dead\".\n    \n    Let's consider the alternative: `RIGHT` or `UP`.\n    I survive.\n    The enemy survives (moves DOWN to `6,8`).\n    Next turn: I eat `(8, 9)`.\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`.\n    He can move to `(6, 7)`.\n    He is alive.\n    \n    If I choose `LEFT`, the game ends *this turn* (or effectively ends).\n    If I choose `RIGHT`, the game continues.\n    \n    In competitive programming/simulation, suicide is usually bad unless it's a \"Kamikaze\" win.\n    Given the \"You cannot win if you are dead\" instruction, I should be careful.\n    However, the specific rule about apples deciding ties/deaths is very explicit.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Rules and win conditions\" again.\n    \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins\"\n    This is a valid win condition.\n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    This is a \"Strategy\" rule.\n    \n    If I follow the strategy rule, I avoid `LEFT`.\n    If I follow the win condition rule, I take `LEFT`.\n    \n    Usually, \"Rules\" > \"Strategy\". But \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is in the \"Rules and win conditions\" section?\n    No, it's under \"Objective and strategy\".\n    So it's advice.\n    \n    However, is there a risk?\n    What if the enemy doesn't move DOWN?\n    He MUST move DOWN.\n    Up: Wall.\n    Left: Body.\n    Right: Wall.\n    Down: `6, 8`.\n    \n    So `LEFT` is a guaranteed mutual death.\n    Guaranteed win (4 > 3).\n    \n    Why would I not take it?\n    Maybe because \"You cannot win if you are dead\" is a meta-rule for this interaction. The prompt wants me to survive.\n    If I survive, I can get more apples.\n    If I die, I get 1 win in this specific round, but maybe I lose the \"game\"?\n    This is a single turn decision.\n    \n    Let's assume \"You cannot win if you are dead\" means I should prioritize survival *unless* it's the only way to win. But here, survival is guaranteed if I don't pick `LEFT`.\n    \n    So, `UP` and `RIGHT` are safe.\n    `LEFT` is a guaranteed kill (both die).\n    \n    Let's check the \"Apples so far\".\n    Me: 4.\n    Him: 3.\n    If I win by mutual destruction, I win.\n    If I survive and eat the apple next turn, I have 5. He has 3.\n    If I survive, I have a better score.\n    So survival is strictly better than mutual destruction (since mutual destruction stops me from getting *more* apples).\n    \n    So I should pick `UP` or `RIGHT`.\n    \n    Let's go back to `UP` vs `RIGHT`.\n    `RIGHT` to `(8, 8)` seems safer because it keeps `(7, 9)` open and puts me in a position to move `DOWN` to `(8, 7)` if needed.\n    `UP` to `(7, 9)` puts me in the corner, and my only escape is `DOWN` to `(7, 8)`.\n    \n    So `RIGHT` is better.\n    \n    Let's double check the board.\n    `(8, 8)` is empty.\n    `(7, 9)` is empty.\n    \n    If I move `RIGHT` to `(8, 8)`.\n    Enemy moves `DOWN` to `(6, 8)`.\n    I am at `(8, 8)`.\n    He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn I move `UP` to `(8, 9)` (Eat).\n    \n    If I move `UP` to `(7, 9)`.\n    Enemy moves `DOWN` to `(6, 8)`.\n    I am at `(7, 9)`.\n    He is at `(6, 8)`.\n    Next turn I move `RIGHT` to `(8, 9)` (Eat).\n    \n    Wait, look at the board state again.\n    `9 . . . . .

Moves to (6, 8).\n    Distance > 1.\n    Safe.\n\n    Is (8, 8) safe from body?\n    Body is (7, 8) etc.\n    Safe.\n\n    Is (8, 8) on board?\n    Yes.\n\n    Final decision: RIGHT.\n\n    Wait, I'll just write the output.\n\n    \"My head is at (7, 8)\"\n    \"Move RIGHT to (8, 8)\"\n    \n    \"You cannot win if you are dead.\"\n    `LEFT` kills me.\n    `RIGHT` keeps me alive.\n    \n    `RIGHT`.\n\n    (One tiny doubt: is the enemy smart? He is trapped. He moves DOWN. If I move LEFT, we die. I win. But I am dead. If the prompt says I can't win if I am dead, then I can't use this tactic.)\n    \n    So `RIGHT`.\n\n    Wait, I'll verify \"You cannot win if you are dead\" one last time.\n    It's in the \"Objective and strategy\" section.\n    It is advice.\n    \"If all snakes die ... the snake with more apples wins\" is in \"Rules and win conditions\".\n    Technically, winning on death is allowed.\n    But in these prompts, the \"Strategy\" advice is usually strict.\n    If I die, I lose the \"simulation\" or \"agency\".\n    So I should not die.\n    \n    So `RIGHT`.\n\n    (Or `UP`. But `RIGHT` is better).\n    \n    I will choose `RIGHT`.\n\n    One last check on the apple list.\n    Apples: (8, 9), (4, 7), (2, 4), (1, 1), (4, 2).\n    I want (8, 9).\n    (8, 8) is the correct step.\n\n    (Wait, is (7, 8) an apple? The list says no. The board visualization in the prompt text shows `A` at (4, 7) and (4, 2) etc. The `0` is at (7, 8). No apple there.)\n    \n    So I am just moving into position.\n\n    I will write the plan.\n\n    Plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to approach the apple at (8, 9). This path keeps an escape route open DOWN to (8, 7), which is safer than moving UP to (7, 9) where I would be blocked by my own body. The enemy snake is trapped and will move DOWN to (6, 8), posing no immediate threat.\n\n    Move: RIGHT.\n\n    (Wait, I'm at (7, 8). My body is (7, 7). If I move UP to (7, 9), my body is (7, 8), (7, 7). I can't go DOWN.\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 8), my body is (7, 8), (7, 7). I can go DOWN to (8, 7).\n    Yes.)\n\n    Correct.\n\n    Output:\n    Plan...\n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n    I must not have anything after it.\n    I will put the plan above it.\n\n    Plan: I will move RIGHT to (8, 8). This approaches the apple at (8, 9) and maintains an escape route to (8, 7), avoiding the trap of the corner at (7, 9). The enemy snake is forced to move DOWN to (6, 8) and poses no immediate threat.\n\n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, I should not include \"Future directions\" in the plan if possible, or keep it vague. \"I will move RIGHT\" is okay as it's explaining the current move.\n    \n    Let's write it.\n\n    Analysis: I am at (7, 8). I want the apple at (8, 9). I can go RIGHT to (8, 8) or UP to (7, 9). RIGHT is better because it leaves (8, 7) open for escape. UP traps me against my body. The enemy at (6, 9) must move DOWN to (6, 8) or die, so he is not a threat. I will avoid suicide (LEFT) as per the \"stay alive\" strategy.\n\n    RIGHT\n\n    (Wait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\")\n    \n    So I can just dump my thoughts or write a clean plan. I'll write a clean plan.\n\n    Plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to safely approach the apple at (8, 9). This preserves the escape route DOWN to (8, 7), unlike UP which traps me against my body. The enemy snake is safely contained at (6, 9) and will be forced DOWN.\n\n    RIGHT\n\n    This looks good.\n\n    Wait, is there any possibility that moving RIGHT to (8, 8) puts me in danger from an unexpected move?\n    Enemy is at (6, 9).\n    Up: Wall.\n    Left: Body.\n    Right: Wall.\n    Down: (6, 8).\n    He has only one move. (6, 8).\n    (6, 8) is safe.\n    \n    So I am safe.\n    \n    Final check of the move: RIGHT.\n    Target: (8, 8).\n    Type: Move.\n    \n    All good.\n\n    One small thing. \"Apples at: (8, 9), (4, 7), (2, 4), (1, 1), (4, 2)\"\n    If I move RIGHT, I am at (8, 8).\n    Next turn I eat (8, 9).\n    This is a good play.\n\n    I am confident in RIGHT.\n\n    The user prompt ends with \"RIGHT\".\n\n    Wait, I should check if (8, 8) is an apple. No.\n    \n    The \"Last Move\" was UP (to 7, 8).\n    The \"Last Rationale\" said there was an apple there. The prompt state says there isn't.\n    I rely on the prompt state.\n\n    So, I move RIGHT.\n\n    Output format:\n    Plan...\n    RIGHT\n\n    Or just:\n    RIGHT\n\n    I will include a brief plan.\n\n    Plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to position for the apple at (8, 9) while keeping an escape route open. The enemy is trapped and not a threat.\n\n    RIGHT\n\n    (Wait, I should not say \"The enemy is trapped\" if I'm just thinking out loud. But the prompt says \"You may think out loud\".)\n    \n    Okay.\n\n    Final decision: RIGHT.\n    \n    Wait, is there any chance the enemy moves LEFT?\n    He is at (6, 9).\n    His body is (5, 9).\n    If he moves LEFT to (5, 9), he hits his own body (tail).\n    He dies.\n    So he won't do that.\n    \n    So he moves DOWN.\n    \n    I am safe.\n\n    I will output the plan and the move.\n\n    Plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to safely approach the apple at (8, 9) and maintain an escape route to (8, 7), avoiding the trap at (7, 9).\n\n    RIGHT\n    \n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    So I should write a plan for the *next* turns.\n    \n    \"Move to (8, 8). Next turn move UP to eat (8, 9).\"\n    \n    Plan: Move to (8, 8) to approach the apple at (8, 9). Next turn, move UP to (8, 9) to eat. This path preserves the escape route at (8, 7).\n    \n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, I'll keep it short.\n    \n    Plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to approach the apple at (8, 9). This path preserves the escape route (8, 7) and is safer than UP.\n    \n    RIGHT\n\n    (Wait, I should not include \"RIGHT\" in the plan text if I'm writing it before the move. But it's fine.)\n\n    Let's just write:\n\n    Plan: Move towards the apple at (8, 9) via (8, 8). This keeps an escape route open (8, 7) and avoids trapping myself against my body at (7, 9). The enemy is contained.\n\n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, the enemy is at (6, 9). He is not \"contained\" in the sense of being blocked, but he is forced to move to a safe spot away from me.\n\n    Let's just write the move.\n\n    RIGHT",

(4, 7) is also close (Manhattan distance 6).\n- Obstacles:\n  - My body occupies (8, 8), blocking LEFT.\n  - Enemy #1's body occupies (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8).\n  - Enemy #1's head is at (8, 9), adjacent to my target (8, 8).\n\nMove evaluation:\n1. **LEFT**: My body is at (8, 8). This is illegal (suicide).\n2. **UP**: To (9, 9). The board size is 0-9, so Y=9 is valid.\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - My body: (8, 8), (7, 8), etc. (9, 9) is empty.\n     - Enemy #1 body: (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8). (9, 9) is empty.\n     - Enemy #1 head: Currently at (8, 9). Enemy #1 must move. If Enemy #1 moves UP, they die (off board). If Enemy #1 moves LEFT to (7, 9), they hit their own body. If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (8, 8), they hit my body (I win). If Enemy #1 moves RIGHT to (9, 9), we have a head-on collision (both die).\n     - Since Enemy #1 is trapped and forced to move into a wall or a body (or my body), they are likely to die. Even if they move to (9, 9), we both die. But if I stay or move elsewhere, I lose the chance to eat the apple at (8, 6) and might get trapped. However, moving UP leaves me at (9, 9), a corner. This is dangerous long-term.\n3. **RIGHT**: To (10, 8). X=10 is outside the board (0-9). Dies.\n4. **DOWN**: To (9, 7).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - My body: (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7). (9, 7) is empty.\n     - Enemy #1 body: (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8). (9, 7) is empty.\n     - Enemy #1 head: If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (8, 8), they hit my body (I win). If Enemy #1 moves UP (die), LEFT (die), or RIGHT to (9, 9).\n   - **Why DOWN is best**:\n     - It moves towards the apple at (8, 6) (and (4, 7)).\n     - It keeps me away from the corner at (9, 9).\n     - It maintains a safe distance from Enemy #1. If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (8, 8), they die against my body. If they move UP, they die against the wall. If they move RIGHT to (9, 9), they are safe for one turn, but then they are trapped in the corner with me at (9, 7).\n     - Moving DOWN opens up the path to the left along y=7 towards the apple at (4, 7) and clears the way to loop back towards (8, 6).\n     - Comparing UP and DOWN: UP leads to (9, 9), a dead end. DOWN leads to (9, 7), from which I can move LEFT to (8, 7) or further DOWN. (8, 7) is currently an empty space (marked '.' on the map). (8, 7) is the escape route I mentioned in my last rationale.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9, 7). This avoids the immediate trap at (9, 9) and prepares to navigate towards the apples at (8, 6) and (4, 7). I will monitor Enemy #1's movement; if they move to (9, 9), they are cornered. If they move to (8, 8), they die.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**START LAST RATIONALE**\nBoard state analysis for Turn 16:\n- **My position**: Head at (9, 7). Body at [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]. I just moved DOWN from (9, 8) to (9, 7).\n- **Enemy #1**: Head at (9, 9). Body at [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)].\n- **Board Context**: I am in the rightmost column (x=9). Enemy #1 is in the top-right corner and the top row.\n- **Obstacles**:\n  - **My body**: Directly above me at (9, 8). To my right is outside the board. Below me is (9, 6).\n  - **Enemy #1**: Their head is at (9, 9), directly above my previous position (9, 8). They are potentially trapping me if they move DOWN.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Simultaneous Prediction)**:\n1. **UP**: To (9, 8).\n   - **Collision**: My body is currently at (9, 8) (this was my head on the previous turn). Moving here is moving backwards into my own body. This is suicide. **Eliminate**.\n2. **DOWN**: To (9, 6).\n   - **Collision**: (9, 6) is currently empty (marked '.' on the map).\n   - **Enemy Interaction**: Enemy #1 is at (9, 9). If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (9, 8), they do not hit me (I am at 9,7). If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (9, 8), they are safe. If I move DOWN to (9, 6), I survive.\n   - **Apple**: Moves me closer to the apple at (8, 6) (Manhattan distance reduces to 1).\n   - **Long-term**: Moves me out of the immediate corner pressure. (9, 6) allows me to move LEFT to (8, 6) next turn.\n3. **LEFT**: To (8, 7).\n   - **Collision**: (8, 7) is currently empty (marked '.' on the map).\n   - **Enemy Interaction**: Safe.\n   - **Apple**: Moves me towards the cluster of apples at (4, 7), (2, 4), etc.\n   - **Long-term**: (8, 7) is a solid spot, but (9, 6) allows me to eat the (8, 6) apple immediately next turn (unless the enemy gets it, but the enemy is far away at (9, 9)).\n4. **RIGHT**: To (10, 7).\n   - **Collision**: X=10 is off the board. **Eliminate**.\n\n**Decision**:\nBoth **LEFT** and **DOWN** are safe immediate moves.\n- **LEFT** (to 8,7) leaves me on y=7, pathing towards (4,7).\n- **DOWN** (to 9,6) leads directly to the apple at (8,6). Since I am at (9,7), moving **DOWN** to (9,6) puts me adjacent to (8,6). Even if Enemy #1 moves UP or Left, they are far away. I can secure the apple at (8,6) on the next turn by moving LEFT.\n- Moving **DOWN** also diversifies my path away from the top wall where the enemy is currently located.\n- Wait, checking the map again.\n  - My head (9,7).\n  - My body: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7).\n  - Enemy Head: (9,9).\n  - Enemy Body: (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9).\n  - Apple: (8,6) is very close.\n  \n  If I move **DOWN** to (9,6):\n  - My new head: (9,6).\n  - My body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)].\n  - Next turn, I can move **LEFT** to (8,6) to eat the apple.\n  \n  If I move **LEFT** to (8,7):\n  - My new head: (8,7).\n  - My body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)].\n  - Next turn, I can move **LEFT** to (7,7) or **DOWN** to (8,6).\n  \n  The apple at (8,6) is the closest. Let's secure the path to it. Enemy #1 is at (9,9). They are likely to move **DOWN** to (9,8) (attacking my old position) or **LEFT** (into their own body). If they move **DOWN** to (9,8), I am at (9,7). We are adjacent vertically. If I am at (9,6) and they are at (9,8), we are safe. If I am at (9,6) and they move **DOWN** to (9,8), I move **LEFT** to (8,6) on the next turn. They cannot hit me.\n  \n  So, **DOWN** is optimal to approach the apple.\n  \n  **Wait**, I must ensure I don't trap myself.\n  If I go DOWN to (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6). If I go LEFT to (8,7), I can go DOWN to (8,6).\n  Moving DOWN now means I am \"below\" the enemy. This is often safer.\n  \n  Let's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\n  Moving from (9,7) to (9,8) is UP. (9,8) is my body. So UP is illegal.\n  \n  Let's reconsider Enemy #1.\n  Enemy #1 at (9,9).\n  If Enemy #1 moves DOWN, they go to (9,8). That is my previous spot, now occupied by my body (except my tail might move).\n  My body currently: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7).\n  If I move DOWN to (9,6), my body becomes: (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8).\n  So (9,8) is occupied by my body.\n  If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (9,8), they hit my body. They die. I survive.\n  If Enemy #1 moves UP (off board), they die.\n  If Enemy #1 moves LEFT to (8,9), they hit their own body (8,9 is in their body list). They die.\n  If Enemy #1 moves RIGHT (off board), they die.\n  \n  So Enemy #1 is in a terrible spot. They are likely dead or forced to move into my body.\n  Regardless of what they do, I should just take the safe move that leads to an apple.\n  \n  **DOWN** leads to (9,6).\n  **LEFT** leads to (8,7).\n  \n  (9,6) -> (8,6) eats apple.\n  (8,7) -> (8,6) eats apple.\n  \n  Is there any risk to (9,6)?\n  If Enemy #1 moves DOWN (to 9,8), I am safe.\n  If I go to (8,7), I am moving into the \"middle\".\n  \n  Let's look at the empty spots on the map for row 7.\n  Row 7: \". . . . A . . T . 0\"\n  Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  My head is at 9.\n  My body is at 7, 8? Wait.\n  My body: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7).\n  So (8,7) is currently '.'.\n  (9,7) is currently '0' (my head).\n  \n  If I go **LEFT** to (8,7):\n  I am safe.\n  Next turn I can go **LEFT** or **DOWN**.\n  If I go **LEFT** to (7,7), that is my tail (7,7) currently? My tail is (7,7). By the time I move, my tail might move if I don't eat. Actually, my tail is the last element of the list: (7,7). If I don't eat, the tail moves forward. So (7,7) will become free eventually.\n  \n  Actually, looking at the board map:\n  7: . . . . A . . T . 0\n  The 'T' at (8,8) and (9,8) are my body.\n  (8,7) is safe.\n  \n  However, (8,6) is an apple.\n  (9,6) is safe.\n  \n  The apple at (8,6) is the closest.\n  \n  Let's choose **LEFT**?\n  If I go **LEFT** to (8,7):\n  - I am at (8,7).\n  - My body: (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8).\n  - My tail is (7,8) (since I am growing? No, I have 4 apples. If I don't eat, I don't grow. I move head, tail follows).\n  - Wait, if I don't eat, the tail moves. The list is head->tail. Head moves. New tail is the second to last.\n  - Current list: (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7). (Wait, the prompt says \"Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]\". Head is (9,7). Total length 5).\n  - If I move to (8,7), new list: (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8). Tail becomes (7,8).\n  - So (7,7) becomes empty.\n  \n  If I go **DOWN** to (9,6):\n  - New list: (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8). Tail becomes (7,8). (7,7) becomes empty.\n  \n  Both are valid.\n  \n  Why choose **LEFT**?\n  - (8,7) is more central.\n  - (9,6) is in the corner column.\n  \n  Why choose **DOWN**?\n  - Gets me closer to the apple at (8,6) (distance 1).\n  - Moves me away from the enemy at (9,9).\n  \n  Let's check the board map for row 6.\n  6: . . . . . . . . A .\n  (8,6) is an apple.\n  (9,6) is empty.\n  \n  If I go **DOWN** to (9,6):\n  - Next turn I can go **LEFT** to (8,6) to eat the apple.\n  - This is a straight shot.\n  \n  If I go **LEFT** to (8,7):\n  - Next turn I can go **DOWN** to (8,6) to eat the apple.\n  \n  I am currently at (9,7). Enemy is at (9,9).\n  Enemy is likely to move **DOWN**.\n  If Enemy moves **DOWN** to (9,8), they hit my body (9,8).\n  So Enemy will likely die or move elsewhere.\n  \n  I want to secure the apple at (8,6).\n  I will move **DOWN**.\n  \n  Wait, checking the \"Backwards\" rule again.\n  My body connects from (9,7) to (9,8). So (9,8) is \"behind\" my head.\n  Moving UP is backwards.\n  \n  Let's confirm the move **LEFT**.\n  If I go **LEFT** to (8,7):\n  - (8,7) is empty.\n  - (8,8) is my body.\n  - (7,7) is my body.\n  - (7,8) is my body.\n  - (9,7) is my body (after I move).\n  - (9,8) is my body.\n  \n  I'll go **LEFT**. It feels safer to not be at the wall if I can avoid it. (9,6) is a dead end if I don't leave immediately. (8,7) offers Left or Down to (8,6). (8,7) is also closer to (4,7).\n  \n  Wait, I just moved DOWN to (9,7). If I move LEFT to (8,7), I am moving into the board.\n  \n  Let's look at the enemy again. Head (9,9).\n  If I am at (9,7) and move LEFT to (8,7), and enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), I am at (8,7) and enemy is at (9,8). We are not colliding.\n  If I am at (9,7) and move DOWN to (9,6), and enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), I am at (9,6) and enemy is at (9,8). We are not colliding.\n  \n  I want to eat the apple at (8,6).\n  From (9,7), if I go DOWN, I can go LEFT to (8,6).\n  From (9,7), if I go LEFT, I can go DOWN to (8,6).\n  \n  I will choose **LEFT**. It opens up the board more.\n  \n  Wait, I previously decided on DOWN in my thought process, but then switched to LEFT because of board position.\n  Let's look at the apple at (4,7).\n  (8,7) is on the same Y axis as (4,7).\n  (9,6) is one step below.\n  \n  I'll stick with **LEFT**.\n  \n  Wait, looking at the map again:\n  7: . . . . A . . T . 0\n  Row 7 has an apple at (4,7).\n  I am at (9,7).\n  Moving LEFT puts me at (8,7).\n  Moving DOWN puts me at (9,6).\n  \n  (8,7) is clearly the gateway to the apples on row 7 and below.\n  (9,6) is a bottleneck.\n  \n  However, I must consider the \"Backwards\" rule.\n  My body is at (9,8). So UP is backwards.\n  My body is NOT at (8,7). So LEFT is fine.\n  \n  Okay, I will move **LEFT**.\n  \n  **Wait**, let me check the \"Backwards\" rule one more time.\n  \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n  My head is (9,7). The cell behind is (9,8).\n  If I move UP, I go to (9,8). That is illegal.\n  If I move LEFT, I go to (8,7). That is legal.\n  If I move DOWN, I go to (9,6). That is legal.\n  \n  I'll go **LEFT** to prepare to move towards the center.\n  \n  *Self-Correction*: The prompt asks for the single word output.\n  I'll output **LEFT**.\n  \n  Actually, looking at the map, (9,6) is adjacent to the apple (8,6).\n  (8,7) is adjacent to (8,6).\n  Both are adjacent.\n  (9,6) is a corner column.\n  (8,7) is one step in from the corner.\n  I prefer (8,7).\n  \n  **Wait**, looking at the board state for row 7:\n  . . . . A . . T . 0\n  The 'T' at (8,8) and (9,8).\n  (8,7) is empty.\n  (9,7) is head.\n  \n  I will move LEFT.\n  \n  Let's double check if I missed anything about the enemy.\n  Enemy head (9,9).\n  My head (9,7).\n  Distance is 2.\n  If I move LEFT to (8,7), distance becomes approx 3 (Manhattan).\n  If I move DOWN to (9,6), distance becomes approx 4.\n  \n  I am safe either way.\n  \n  I will go **LEFT** to move towards the apple at (4,7).\n  \n  **Wait**, I see an apple at (2,4) and (1,1).\n  Moving LEFT to (8,7) is good.\n  \n  I'll commit to **LEFT**.\n  \n  **Wait**, I notice (8,6) is an apple.\n  If I go LEFT to (8,7), I am next to (8,6).\n  If I go DOWN to (9,6), I am next to (8,6).\n  (8,7) is better because I can turn LEFT from there to (7,7).\n  \n  I will choose **LEFT**.\n  \n  *Wait*, what if the enemy moves DOWN?\n  If enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), I am at (8,7). Safe.\n  If I am at (9,6), enemy at (9,8). Safe.\n  \n  I'll choose **LEFT**.\n  \n  **Wait**, looking at the board state provided:\n  9 . . . . . T T T T 1\n  8 . . . . . . . T T T\n  7 . . . .

The cell behind is (9,8).\n  I am moving to (8,7). This is NOT backwards.\n  \n  I am moving **LEFT**.\n  \n  **Wait**, I should check if the enemy might move into me.\n  If enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), they hit my old body (9,8).\n  If enemy moves LEFT to (8,9), they hit their own body.\n  If enemy moves UP or RIGHT, they die.\n  So enemy is forced to die or hit my body.\n  This means I am very safe.\n  \n  I will move **LEFT**.\n  \n  *Wait*, I should consider if I can eat an apple immediately.\n  Apples: (4, 7), (2, 4), (1, 1), (4, 2), (8, 6).\n  (8, 6) is close.\n  From (8,7), I can go DOWN to (8,6).\n  From (9,6), I can go LEFT to (8,6).\n  \n  I'll go **LEFT**.\n  \n  **Wait**, one last check.\n  Is (8,7) blocked by any snake body?\n  My body: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7).

This moves me towards the apple at (8,6) and the cluster at (4,7). It avoids the corner at (9,9) and keeps my path flexible. Enemy #1 is cornered and likely to die next turn or commit suicide. I will secure the (8,6) apple on the following turn.\n  \n  **Move**: LEFT.\n  \n  *Wait*, I noticed the \"Backwards\" rule again.\n  \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n  My body is behind me at (9,8).\n  Moving UP goes to (9,8).
