No part of my own body (length 1, so only head).  \n2. Enemy snake #0 is at (1,7), far away.  \n3. All moves are within board boundaries (0-9 for both x and y).  \n4. No immediate collision with enemy's body (enemy has no body yet).  \n5. Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (1,7) could move to (2,7), (0,7), (1,8), (1,6). None of these are my possible next positions. So no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\nSo all 4 moves are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**  \nGoing LEFT to (3,5) eats an apple immediately, growing to length 2.  \nThat\u2019s beneficial because:  \n- Gains a point.  \n- Puts me ahead in apples.  \n- Still safe (no body to collide with except enemy head, but enemy is far).  \n- After eating, my body will be at (4,5) and head at (3,5). Next turn I can move DOWN to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,5) or UP to (3,6) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves into them, but enemy is 4+ Manhattan distance away.\n\nOther moves don\u2019t eat an apple now, delaying progress.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,5), move away from your new body segment at (4,5) \u2014 so DOWN to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,5) are good. Avoid moving back into (4,5) because that\u2019s your own body now. Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s position, which is far for now.\n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Length = 2.\n- Apples at: (6,3), (3,2), (8,3), (6,7), (6,0).\n- Enemy snake #0: head at (2,7), no body (length 1).\n\n**Possible moves from my head (3,5):**\n1. UP \u2192 (3,6)\n2. DOWN \u2192 (3,4)\n3. LEFT \u2192 (2,5)\n4. RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) \u2014 this is my own body segment \u2192 **not safe**.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\n**Safety check for remaining moves:**\n\n- **UP (3,6):**  \n  Within board? Yes.  \n  Occupied by my body? No.  \n  Occupied by enemy body? Enemy has no body yet.  \n  Risk of head-on collision? Enemy head at (2,7) could move UP\u2192(2,8), DOWN\u2192(2,6), LEFT\u2192(1,7), RIGHT\u2192(3,7).  \n  My target (3,6) is adjacent to (3,7) \u2014 if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,7), we don\u2019t collide heads (different cells). Only head-on if enemy moves to same cell (3,6). From (2,7) to (3,6) is not a single move (distance \u221a2). So no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n  \u2192 Safe.\n\n- **DOWN (3,4):**  \n  Within board? Yes.  \n  My body? No.  \n  Enemy body? No.  \n  Enemy could move to (3,4)? From (2,7), no.  \n  \u2192 Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (2,5):**  \n  Within board? Yes.  \n  My body? No.  \n  Enemy body? No.  \n  Enemy could move to (2,5)? From (2,7), DOWN\u2192(2,6), DOWN again not possible in one move. So no.  \n  \u2192 Safe.\n\nAll three moves are safe this turn.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n\nConsider proximity to apples:\n- Apple at (3,2) is closest in Manhattan distance from (3,5): distance = 3.\n- Apple at (6,3): distance from (3,5) = |3-6|+|5-3| = 3+2=5.\n- Apple at (8,3): distance 7.\n- Apple at (6,7): distance 5.\n- Apple at (6,0): distance 8.\n\nFrom (3,5):\n- UP (3,6): distances to (3,2)=4, (6,3)=4, (6,7)=2, (8,3)=6, (6,0)=9.\n- DOWN (3,4): to (3,2)=2, (6,3)=4, (6,7)=6, (8,3)=6, (6,0)=6.\n- LEFT (2,5): to (3,2)=4, (6,3)=6, (6,7)=6, (8,3)=8, (6,0)=9.\n\nDOWN gets me closest to apple (3,2) (distance 2). Also (6,3) is 4 away, not bad.\n\n**Future safety:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (3,4), my body will be at [(3,4), (4,5)].\nNext turn from (3,4), possible moves: UP (back to (3,5) \u2014 body? No, body at (4,5) and (3,4) tail? Wait, snake grows only if eats apple. I didn\u2019t eat apple this turn, so length stays 2, tail moves forward? Actually rules: If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment. If no apple, you move head forward, tail follows (no growth). So after moving without apple, body becomes [(3,4), (3,5)]? Let\u2019s check: head moves to (3,4), previous head (3,5) becomes neck, tail (4,5) disappears? No \u2014 Snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts into previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) vacates its cell. So after moving DOWN without apple: head at (3,4), body[1] at (3,5), tail gone. So (4,5) empty now.\n\nThat means next turn from (3,4), possible moves: UP (3,5) (now empty), DOWN (3,3), LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.\n\nEnemy at (2,7): possible moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. Could he move into (3,5)? From (2,7) to (3,5) not possible in one move. So safe.\n\nThus DOWN seems good for apple proximity and keeps options open.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (3,4), next turn aim for (3,2) apple via DOWN again to (3,3) then DOWN to (3,2). Watch enemy movement \u2014 enemy is far for now, but could approach. Keep distance from enemy head to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk.  \n- **LEFT (2,3):** safe, empty.  \n- **RIGHT (4,3):** safe, empty.  \n\nAll three moves are safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (3,2) distance 1 from (3,3). Moving DOWN eats it immediately. Eating apple now is good for score and growth.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (2,7) is far away, not an immediate threat to (3,2) or (2,3)/(4,3).  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n- If DOWN to (3,2) and eat apple: new head (3,2), body becomes [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] length 3.

It has no body, so only head matters for collisions.  \nPossible moves for enemy: from (3, 7) could go UP to (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 6), LEFT to (2, 7), RIGHT to (4, 7).  \nNone of those intersect my possible head positions this turn, except if I move to (3, 3) etc., which I\u2019m not. So no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (6, 3) \u2192 1 right, 1 up from head? Actually from (5, 2) to (6, 3) is RIGHT+UP, distance 2.  \n- (6, 0) \u2192 RIGHT+DOWNx2, distance 3.  \n- (8, 3) \u2192 3 right, 1 up, distance 4.  \n\nUP from (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 3) is closer to (6, 3) than staying.  \nRIGHT from (5, 2) \u2192 (6, 2) is closer to (6, 3) and (6, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**Future move availability:**  \nFrom (5, 3) if I go UP: possible next moves: UP to (5, 4), LEFT to (4, 3), RIGHT to (6, 3) (apple), DOWN back to (5, 2) (but that\u2019s my old head position, now empty? Wait, my body will follow so tail moves from (3, 2) to (4, 2), so (5, 2) will be empty next turn). Actually let\u2019s track:  \n\nIf I move UP now:  \nHead to (5, 3), body becomes [(5, 2), (4, 2)] because we don\u2019t grow unless eat apple.  \nSo next turn body: head at (5, 3), neck at (5, 2), tail at (4, 2).  \nFrom (5, 3) next turn:  \n- UP to (5, 4) free  \n- DOWN to (5, 2) is my neck \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT to (4, 3) free  \n- RIGHT to (6, 3) free (and apple)  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT now:  \nHead to (6, 2), body becomes [(5, 2), (4, 2)].  \nFrom (6, 2) next turn:  \n- UP to (6, 3) free (apple)  \n- DOWN to (6, 1) free  \n- LEFT to (5, 2) my neck \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT to (7, 2) free  \n\nAlso 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I move DOWN now:  \nHead to (5, 1), body [(5, 2), (4, 2)].  \nFrom (5, 1) next turn:  \n- UP to (5, 2) my neck \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN to (5, 0) free  \n- LEFT to (4, 1) free  \n- RIGHT to (6, 1) free  \n\nAlso 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo all safe moves give same future mobility this step.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term planning note:**  \nEnemy snake is far away (top left area), not an immediate threat. Focus on collecting apples while keeping body out of dead ends. The apple at (6, 3) is reachable in two moves from (5, 2) via RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT. RIGHT now gets me closer to (6, 0) as well if needed later. Going UP now also fine. But RIGHT seems slightly better because:  \n- It moves toward two apples ((6, 3) and (6, 0)).  \n- It avoids moving toward top center where enemy might eventually come.  \n- From (6, 2), I can go to (6, 3) next turn for apple, then grow, which may help block enemy later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:**  \nRIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Body at (6,7) (DOWN from head) and (5,7).  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (6,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,9): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7): its own body \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): empty.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nWe must avoid head-on collision: if enemy goes RIGHT to (7,8) and I go LEFT to (7,1), no conflict (different y). If enemy goes LEFT to (5,8) or UP to (6,9), no conflict. So head-on not an issue this turn because we\u2019re far apart.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n1. (8,5) \u2014 4 steps away vertically.  \n2. (9,2) \u2014 2 steps diagonally, but direct path?  \n3. (6,0) \u2014 2 steps diagonally.  \n4. (4,4) \u2014 far.  \n5. (9,9) \u2014 far.  \n\nFrom (8,1):  \n- DOWN to (8,0): puts me closer to apple (6,0): Manhattan distance from (8,0) to (6,0) = 2.  \n- LEFT to (7,1): distance to (6,0) = |7-6| + |1-0| = 1+1=2. Same distance.  \n- RIGHT to (9,1): distance to (9,2) = 1, but (9,2) is apple.  \n\n(9,2) is very close if I go RIGHT then UP next turn. But going RIGHT now to (9,1) means next turn UP to (9,2) \u2014 but need to check if that\u2019s safe next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \n\nLet\u2019s check each safe move\u2019s next-move options:  \n\n1. **DOWN to (8,0):**  \n   Next from (8,0): UP back to (8,1) \u2014 currently safe (will my tail move away? Let\u2019s see: my tail is at (6,3), after I move, body shifts: new body = [(8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3)]? Wait, length is 5: head moves to (8,0), then neck becomes old head (8,1), then (8,2), (8,3), (7,3) tail. So (8,1) will be body next turn. So moving back UP to (8,1) next turn would hit own body \u2192 not safe next turn.  \n   From (8,0) next turn: safe moves? UP: (8,1) body \u2192 no. LEFT: (7,0) empty. RIGHT: (9,0) empty. DOWN: out of bounds (y=-1). So only LEFT or RIGHT next turn. That\u2019s risky \u2014 puts me in a corridor with only 2 moves, possibly fewer later.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (7,1):**  \n   Next from (7,1):  \n   UP: (7,2) empty.  \n   DOWN: (7,0) empty.  \n   LEFT: (6,1) empty.  \n   RIGHT: (8,1) \u2014 will be body next turn (old head) \u2192 no.  \n   So 3 safe moves next turn. Good.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (9,1):**  \n   Next from (9,1):  \n   UP: (9,2) apple \u2014 will it be safe? Need to check if enemy could be there or my body: my body next turn: [(9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3)], so (9,2) empty. Enemy possible moves: none can reach (9,2) in 1 turn from (6,8). So UP to apple likely safe next turn.  \n   DOWN: (9,0) empty.  \n   LEFT: (8,1) body \u2192 no.  \n   RIGHT: out of bounds.  \n   So 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN). That\u2019s okay, especially if UP gets apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \n- DOWN (8,0) \u2192 only 2 moves next turn, not toward nearest apple except (6,0) which requires LEFT then DOWN, but that path may be blocked later by my own body.  \n- LEFT (7,1) \u2192 more options next turn, can go toward (6,0) or (4,4) flexibly.  \n- RIGHT (9,1) \u2192 can get apple (9,2) next turn safely, grows length, improves score.  \n\nGiven objective: prefer moves that increase chance of eating apples safely \u2192 RIGHT seems best: gets apple next turn for sure if I go UP then.  \n\nBut must ensure I don\u2019t get trapped after eating apple at (9,2): after eating, my length becomes 6, tail at (7,3) still. From (9,2), possible moves: DOWN to (9,1) body? Wait, after growth: new body = [(9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3)], so (9,1) is body, so DOWN not possible. LEFT to (8,2) body? (8,2) is body. UP to (9,3) empty. RIGHT out of bounds. So from (9,2) after eating apple, only UP is safe. That\u2019s risky \u2014 only one move.  \n\nSo eating apple at (9,2) next turn leads to possible trap unless tail moves away by then.  \n\nLet\u2019s check: If I go RIGHT now to (9,1), then next turn UP to (9,2) apple, length 6, body = [(9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3)], from (9,2) only UP safe. Then next turn from (9,3): possible moves: DOWN body, LEFT (8,3) body, RIGHT out, UP (9,4) empty. So again only UP. That\u2019s a death path along top edge.  \n\nSo maybe not good.  \n\nLEFT (7,1) is better for keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nFrom (7,1), can go to (6,1) then to (6,0) apple, or toward (4,4). Keep central flexibility, avoid edges until necessary.  \n\nGiven this, LEFT seems best for long-term safety and options.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

So only LEFT next turn \u2192 risky.  \n- DOWN to (7,0): next moves: UP (7,1) body \u2192 no, DOWN out, LEFT (6,0) apple (if still there), RIGHT (8,0) empty. So 2 moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT). LEFT leads to apple (6,0) if still there next turn.  \n- LEFT to (6,1): next moves: UP (6,2) empty, DOWN (6,0) apple, LEFT (5,1) empty, RIGHT (7,1) body \u2192 no. So 3 moves next turn, good flexibility, can go for apple (6,0) or toward (4,4).\n\nApple distances from (7,1):  \n- (6,0): Manhattan dist 2.  \n- (9,2): dist 3.  \n- (8,5): dist 5.  \n- (4,4): dist 6.  \n- (9,9): dist 10.\n\nClosest is (6,0), reachable in 2 moves via LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Avoid dead ends**  \nIf I go UP \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 only LEFT safe next turn \u2192 could get trapped soon.  \nIf I go DOWN \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 next turn only LEFT (to apple) or RIGHT \u2192 okay but limited.  \nIf I go LEFT \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 more options next turn, keeps central access.\n\nGiven my body layout, moving LEFT seems best for keeping future options open while moving toward closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note**  \nAfter LEFT to (6,1), next turn consider DOWN to (6,0) apple if available, else maybe toward (4,4) via (5,1) etc. Avoid top-right corner trap. Keep enemy in mind\u2014currently far away.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",
