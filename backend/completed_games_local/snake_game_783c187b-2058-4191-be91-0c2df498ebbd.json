Eating it would grow my length to 2, with tail at (8, 3).  \nIf I go DOWN to (8, 2), next turn my body will be at [(8, 2), (8, 3)], so my head at (8, 2) cannot move back up into (8, 3) (that\u2019s my own body then).  \n\nBut that\u2019s fine; I\u2019ll have other moves next turn from (8, 2): left to (7, 2), right to (9, 2), down to (8, 1) (another apple), up blocked by body.  \n\nAlso, enemy snake is far away at (1, 9), so no immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options after each move:**  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 eat apple, grow, next turn still 3 possible moves (left, right, down).  \n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 4) \u2013 no apple, but opens more space; next turn from (8, 4) all 4 directions open.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 3) \u2013 no apple, but moves toward board center.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 3) \u2013 no apple, near right edge, reduces future options slightly.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Strategy:**  \n\nEating early is good because longer snakes can block enemies later. The apple at (8, 2) is one step away, so immediate growth.  \nAlso, (8, 1) is another apple below (8, 2), so I could chain apples quickly.  \n\nRisk: going DOWN means next turn I can\u2019t go UP, but that\u2019s fine because DOWN again leads to another apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \n\nIf I eat (8, 2) now, next turn go DOWN to (8, 1) to eat that apple too, then maybe LEFT to (7, 1) to avoid trapping myself on bottom row.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gets apple, grows, sets up for another apple next turn, safe now.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating (8, 2), go DOWN to (8, 1) if safe to eat second apple, else LEFT/RIGHT to avoid dead ends.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, in Snake, after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so next turn my body will be: head at (8, 1), then (8, 2), then (8, 3). So yes, UP from (8, 1) next turn is blocked.  \n\nBut I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. That\u2019s okay.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \n\nAfter eating (8, 1), next turn go LEFT to (7, 1) to avoid bottom row trap and keep options open. Then consider moving toward center or other apples like (4, 7) or (7, 9). Avoid moving toward enemy until longer.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN to eat apple and grow safely.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait: my body after this turn: head moves to new spot, tail moves from (7,2) to (8,2)? Let's check: current body: [(8,2),(7,2)], head at (8,1). If I move LEFT to (7,1), body becomes [(7,1),(8,2),(7,2)]? Actually, snake moves: head to (7,1), tail segment at (7,2) disappears? No \u2014 growth only on apple. No apple eaten this turn, so tail moves: head to (7,1), then old (8,2) becomes new segment 2, old (7,2) becomes tail? Wait, standard snake: body segments shift: new head at (7,1), previous head (8,1) becomes segment 2, previous segment 2 (8,2) becomes segment 3 (tail), previous tail (7,2) is removed. So after moving LEFT, body = [(7,1),(8,1),(8,2)]. So (7,2) is empty next turn.  \n\nSo from (7,1) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,2) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,0) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,1) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,1) empty  \nAll 4 moves safe next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose move for apple and future options:**  \n\nRIGHT puts me at (9, 1) with 3 safe moves next turn, and next turn I can go DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple.  \nDOWN puts me at (8, 0) with 3 safe moves next turn, and next turn I can go RIGHT to (9, 0) to eat apple.  \nLEFT puts me at (7, 1) with 4 safe moves next turn but moves me away from closest apple.  \n\nGiven I want (9, 0), RIGHT is more direct (next turn DOWN to apple). DOWN also works but is symmetric in steps.  \n\nBut RIGHT now to (9, 1) means next turn I must avoid going RIGHT (off board), so only UP, DOWN, LEFT available. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away, so no immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT to (9, 1) to be adjacent to apple (9, 0). Next turn, go DOWN to eat apple unless something changes. Keep an eye on enemy moving toward other apples; they are far away now.  \n\nRIGHT",

So safe moves: UP and LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**If LEFT to (8, 2):**  \nAfter moving LEFT: head to (8,2), body becomes [(8,2),(9,2),(9,1)], tail (8,1) removed.  \nNext turn from (8,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,3) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1) empty (tail removed this turn, so empty now).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,2) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nLEFT gives more options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nLEFT keeps more future flexibility and moves toward board center, avoiding the right-edge trap. UP keeps me near the edge with fewer exits next turn.  \n\nGiven the priority is staying alive with options, LEFT is better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove LEFT now to (8,2), then consider moving toward apples (4,7) or (3,6) via a path that avoids the enemy (currently at (7,7)). Keep distance from enemy head and avoid dead ends.\n\nLEFT",

So (7, 5) is my body segment, so DOWN from (7, 6) would be unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 6) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 6) empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**DOWN to (7, 4):**  \nNext turn from (7, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 3) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 4) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 4) empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 5):**  \nNext turn from (6, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 6) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 4) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 5) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \n\nEnemy at (3, 6) is 1 step from apple (0, 7)? No, (0, 7) is at x=0, y=7, far. Actually apples: (0, 7) is far from enemy. Closest apple to enemy is (1, 5) maybe? Let\u2019s check distances:  \nEnemy (3, 6) to apples:  \n- (0, 3): dx=3, dy=3 \u2192 6 steps.  \n- (9, 0): far.  \n- (0, 2): dx=3, dy=4 \u2192 7 steps.  \n- (1, 5): dx=2, dy=1 \u2192 3 steps.  \n- (0, 7): dx=3, dy=1 \u2192 4 steps.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s nearest apple is (1, 5) (3 steps) and (0, 7) (4 steps).  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3, 5), then LEFT to (2, 5), then LEFT to (1, 5), it can eat (1, 5) in 3 turns.  \n\nI am at (7, 5), to reach (1, 5) I need 6 steps straight left. So enemy will get there before me unless it chooses another target.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Which apple should I target?**  \n\n(0, 7) is 4 steps from enemy, 7 steps from me (via left then up). Enemy might go for (0, 7) if it goes UP first.  \nBut (0, 3) and (0, 2) are on left side, maybe less contested if enemy goes for (1, 5) first.  \n\nIf I move LEFT now to (6, 5), I\u2019m closer to left-side apples and can decide next turn whether to go for (0, 3)/(0, 2) or try to intercept (1, 5) before enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \n\nMove LEFT toward left-side apples (0,3), (0,2), (1,5). Monitor enemy\u2019s movement toward (1,5). If enemy heads for (1,5), maybe aim for (0,7) instead by going up after reaching x=5 or x=4. Keep space, avoid getting trapped in left wall.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

So enemy will likely take (1, 5) this turn.  \n\nThus, I should avoid competing for (1, 5) and instead aim for left-side apples (0, 3) or (0, 2), or maybe (0, 7) if safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 6)**:  \nNew body: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)], tail (7, 5) gone.  \nNext turn from (5, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 7) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 6) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5, 4)**:  \nNew body: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)].  \nNext turn from (5, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 3) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 4) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 4) empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I move **LEFT to (4, 5)**:  \nNew body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)].  \nNext turn from (4, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 6) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 4) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 5) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible moves after eating apple (1, 5):**  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (1, 5) and eats apple, its body grows to length 6: new head (1, 5), body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]? Wait, careful: current enemy body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. If head moves to (1, 5), new body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)], tail (4, 7) gone? No, growth means tail stays, so length 6: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)].  \n\nSo (1, 5) becomes enemy body next turn. That means I should avoid moving toward (1, 5) in future turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nMove LEFT toward left-side apples (0, 3) or (0, 2). Avoid enemy\u2019s likely path toward (0, 7) after it eats (1, 5). Keep space from enemy head.  \n\nLEFT moves me toward left wall apples and away from enemy\u2019s immediate vicinity.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

No, that\u2019s not same cell.  \nWhat about if enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 5) and I move LEFT to (3, 5) \u2014 different cells.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT twice? No, simultaneous moves only.  \nOnly way to collide heads this turn is if we move into same cell:  \n- Enemy RIGHT to (2, 5), me LEFT to (3, 5) \u2192 no.  \n- Enemy RIGHT to (2, 5), me ??? not possible.  \nActually check: enemy at (1,5), me at (4,5). Only common cell reachable in one move: (2,5) not reachable by me in one move from (4,5).

Wait, enemy body: [(1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(4,7)] \u2014 (4,7) is enemy tail. If enemy moves, tail might move unless it grows. But enemy just ate apple last turn? Actually enemy apples: 5, mine 2. Enemy length 6, so last turn it grew after eating (1,5). That means (4,7) is not tail? Let\u2019s reconstruct: enemy head was (1,6), body: [(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(4,7)], length 5. Ate apple at (1,5) \u2192 new head (1,5), body: [(1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(4,7)], length 6. So (4,7) is still tail. So next turn enemy moves, tail (4,7) will disappear unless it eats apple this turn. So (4,7) might be empty next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t eat. But risky to plan for that. Safer to assume (4,7) is enemy body now, so UP from (4,6) to (4,7) is unsafe now. So next turn from (4,6):  \nUP \u2192 (4,7) enemy body now \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,6) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,6) empty.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 4)**:  \nNew body: [(4,4),(4,5),(5,5)].  \nNext turn from (4,4):  \nUP \u2192 (4,5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,3) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,4) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,4) empty.  \n3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (3, 5)**:  \nNew body: [(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)].  \nNext turn from (3,5):  \nUP \u2192 (3,6) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,4) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,5) empty (but enemy could move there this turn? enemy at (1,5) could move RIGHT to (2,5) this turn, making it enemy body next turn). That\u2019s a risk.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, possibly LEFT if enemy doesn\u2019t go RIGHT this turn. But that\u2019s uncertain. So maybe 2 safe moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible moves:**  \n\nEnemy at (1,5) with apples 5, likely wants apples (0,7) or (0,3).  \nFrom (1,5): safe moves are DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5).  \nLEFT to (0,5) gets closer to (0,7) and (0,3).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT, then (2,5) stays empty, so my moving LEFT to (3,5) then next turn LEFT to (2,5) would be safe.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,5), then (2,5) becomes enemy body next turn, blocking my path left.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nI want to avoid risky reduction of future safe moves.  \nUP gives only 2 safe moves next turn and puts me near enemy body.  \nLEFT risks enemy occupying (2,5) and reducing options.  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward apple (4,0).  \n\nApple (4,0) is directly below, 5 steps. I can go DOWN now, then keep going down, maybe grab it in a few turns while avoiding enemy. Enemy is far left, not near (4,0).  \n\nAlso, moving DOWN opens future options to go LEFT/RIGHT along bottom toward other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward apple (4,0) via DOWN moves while checking left/right options to avoid dead ends. Keep enemy on left side in mind; it may go for (0,7) or (0,3), leaving bottom apples for me. After eating (4,0), consider going toward (9,0) or back up safely.\n\nDOWN",

Actually from (1,3) to (3,3) is 2 steps RIGHT, 0 vertical \u2192 distance 2).  \n- (3, 4) is 2 steps away (RIGHT, UP).  \n- (4, 0) is 4 steps away.  \n- (0, 8) far.  \n- (9, 0) far.  \n\nFrom (1,3):  \nUP to (1,4) \u2192 distance to (3,4) becomes 2 steps (RIGHT, RIGHT).  \nRIGHT to (2,3) \u2192 distance to (3,3) becomes 1 step (RIGHT), distance to (3,4) becomes 2 steps (RIGHT, UP).  \n\nRIGHT seems slightly better for apple (3,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf **UP to (1, 4)**:  \nNew body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)], tail (2,1) gone.  \nNext turn from (1, 4):  \nUP \u2192 (1, 5) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 3) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 4) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 4) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf **RIGHT to (2, 3)**:  \nNew body: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)], tail (2,1) gone.  \nNext turn from (2, 3):  \nUP \u2192 (2, 4) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 2) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 3) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) apple (if still there) \u2192 safe unless enemy gets there same turn.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nEnemy is at (7,4), moving possibly toward apples (3,3) or (3,4) as well.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I\u2019m one step from (3,3) apple, but enemy is 4 steps away (|7-3|+|4-3|=4+1=5? Wait, enemy at (7,4) to (3,3) is |4|+|1|=5 steps). So I could get it next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.  \n\nUP to (1,4) is safer from enemy but farther from immediate apples.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer (length 8 vs my 6), I should avoid head-on collision risk. Currently no risk this turn, but if I go RIGHT and enemy goes LEFT toward same apple, we might meet at (3,3) next turn. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nBetter to go UP now, stay safe, aim for (3,4) or (0,8) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4), consider moving toward (3,4) via RIGHT then UP, or toward (0,8) via UP along left wall.

I should avoid risky head-on contests if possible.\n- LEFT both advances toward those apples and keeps more escape options than UP, so it is the preferable move this turn.\n\nShort plan (for next few turns):\n- Continue pressuring leftward to approach (3,4)/(3,3) while watching the enemy\u2019s intent.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after my last move (RIGHT).  \n\n**Current board recap:**  \n- My snake (ID 1): head at (2, 4), body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)], length 6.  \n- Apples: (9,0), (4,0), (0,8), (3,3), (3,4).  \n- Enemy snake #0: head at (5,4), body: [(6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (6,8)], length 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (2,4):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2,5): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4): apple, but check safety.  \n\nCheck RIGHT: (3,4) is an apple, so eating it is safe unless enemy head moves there same turn.  \nEnemy head at (5,4) could move LEFT to (4,4), UP to (5,5), DOWN to (5,3), or RIGHT to (6,4) but (6,4) is its own body so not allowed.  \nSo enemy possible moves: (4,4), (5,5), (5,3).  \nThus (3,4) is not a possible enemy head position this turn.  \nTherefore RIGHT is safe (no head-on collision, no body collision).  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (3,4) \u2014 1 step away via RIGHT.  \n(3,3) is 2 steps away (RIGHT then DOWN).  \n(0,8) is far.  \n(4,0) and (9,0) far.  \n\nRIGHT gets apple immediately, grows to length 7.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf **RIGHT to (3,4)** (eat apple):  \nNew body: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 7.  \nNext turn from (3,4):  \nUP \u2192 (3,5): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,3): apple (if still there).  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,4): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nIf **UP to (2,5)**:  \nNew body: [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 6.  \nNext turn from (2,5):  \nUP \u2192 (2,6): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,5): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,5): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf **DOWN to (2,3)**:  \nNew body: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 6.  \nNext turn from (2,3):  \nUP \u2192 (2,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,2): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,3): apple (if still there).  \nSo 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nSo DOWN limits future moves slightly more.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy movement and apple race:**  \nEnemy at (5,4) wants apples too.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4,4) this turn, next turn it could go LEFT to (3,4) if apple still there.  \nIf I go RIGHT now, I eat (3,4) this turn, so enemy can't get it next turn.  \nIf I don't go RIGHT, enemy might get (3,4) before me.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go for (3,3) if (3,4) gone.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision after eating apple:**  \nAfter I eat (3,4), my head is at (3,4) with body behind me.  \nEnemy at (5,4) could move to (4,4) this turn.  \nNext turn, if enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), it dies (hits my body). That's good for me.  \nSo eating apple now could lure enemy into suicide next turn if it follows.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nAfter eating (3,4), I'll be length 7 vs enemy length 8.  \nNext closest apple is (3,3) or (0,8).  \n(0,8) is far but maybe safer area (enemy far away).  \nBut enemy is long and might block paths.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets apple, grows, keeps good future options, and possibly sets trap for enemy.  \nUP avoids apple but keeps options open.  \nDOWN reduces future options.  \n\nBest is RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,4), if enemy at (4,4), be careful \u2014 enemy could move LEFT into me next turn (but that kills it). If enemy at (4,4), I could go DOWN to (3,3) for another apple, or UP to (3,5) to avoid possible head-on if enemy might move to (3,4) while I'm still there (but that's fine for me). Actually, if enemy moves into my head-on next turn, we'd both die only if heads collide in same cell \u2014 but if I move away and enemy goes to where I was, no collision. So I should move away from (3,4) next turn to avoid tie if enemy comes.  \n\nRIGHT",

They cannot move LEFT (their neck is (2,4)), so the square will be vacated \u2014 LEFT is legal but puts me adjacent to the enemy head and mainly contests the (3,3) apple, which the opponent can take immediately by moving DOWN.\n- UP -> moves to (4,5). Safe, keeps many escape options, but moves away from the nearby low-apple cluster.\n- DOWN -> moves to (4,3). Safe, moves me closer to the (3,3)/(4,0) apples while keeping multiple follow-up options and avoiding any likely head-on collision this turn.\n\nTactical assessment:\n- The opponent at (3,4) can take (3,3) immediately by moving DOWN. I can\u2019t reach (3,3) this turn if they go for it, so aggressively moving LEFT to fight them doesn\u2019t guarantee the apple and just increases proximity risk. \n- UP is safe but drifts away from the nearby apples and gives the opponent easier access to the cluster.\n- DOWN advances toward reachable apples, retains good escape choices (LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn except RIGHT into neck now), and doesn\u2019t create a head-on risk this turn.\n\nShort plan for next few turns:\n- If opponent takes (3,3), pivot toward the bottom apples (4,0 or 9,0) via an approach down the x=4 column, keeping space around my tail for escapes.\n- If opponent avoids (3,3) and contests my position, use positioning (and the fact they can\u2019t move LEFT) to avoid head-on swaps and force them into less favorable moves.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 the game state says my body is [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)] and head at (3,4). That\u2019s length 7 (head + 6 body segments). Yes, because I just grew from eating (3,4).  \n- Apples: (9,0), (4,0), (0,8), (3,3), (8,5).  \n- Enemy snake #0: head at (4,4), body: [(5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)], length 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (3,4):**  \n- UP \u2192 (3,5): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3): apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4): enemy head currently at (4,4) \u2014 but enemy moves simultaneously.  \n\nCheck RIGHT: enemy head at (4,4) could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT this turn.  \nIf enemy stays at (4,4) (by moving LEFT into (3,4)?? No, LEFT from (4,4) is (3,4) which is my head now \u2014 if enemy moves LEFT into (3,4) this turn, that\u2019s head-on collision \u2192 both die. So enemy might avoid that unless it wants to tie.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5,4) (its own body), not allowed.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (4,5) or DOWN to (4,3), those are safe for it.  \nSo enemy possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (into my head \u2192 both die), but maybe it won\u2019t choose LEFT if it sees suicide.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,4) and enemy moves UP/DOWN/STAY? Wait, enemy can\u2019t stay \u2014 must move one of four directions. If enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), we collide head-on in (3,4)? No \u2014 I\u2019d be moving to (4,4), enemy moving to (3,4) \u2014 different cells, no collision. So no head-on risk this turn if I go RIGHT.  \n\nBut if enemy stays at (4,4) by moving LEFT into (3,4)?? That\u2019s impossible because LEFT from (4,4) is (3,4), not staying. So enemy can\u2019t stay at (4,4) unless it moves RIGHT into (5,4) which is its body, so not allowed. So enemy must go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,4) and I go RIGHT to (4,4), we swap positions without collision.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe from immediate death (not off-board, not into my body, not into enemy body unless enemy stays at (4,4) \u2014 but enemy can\u2019t stay).  \n\nActually check: enemy body includes (5,4), so RIGHT from (4,4) is invalid for enemy. So enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4).  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,4) and I go RIGHT to (4,4), we pass each other safely.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (3,3) \u2014 1 step DOWN.  \n(4,0) is 4 steps away.  \n(0,8) far.  \n(8,5) far.  \n(9,0) far.  \n\nDOWN gets apple immediately, grows to length 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf **DOWN to (3,3)** (eat apple):  \nNew body: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 8.  \nNext turn from (3,3):  \nUP \u2192 (3,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,2): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,3): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,3): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf **UP to (3,5)**:  \nNew body: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 7.  \nNext turn from (3,5):  \nUP \u2192 (3,6): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,5): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,5): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf **RIGHT to (4,4)**:  \nNew body: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)], length 7.  \nNext turn from (4,4):  \nUP \u2192 (4,5): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,3): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,4): enemy body (currently) but enemy may move \u2014 risky if enemy leaves body there. Actually enemy\u2019s current body has (5,4) as first segment behind head. If enemy moves, that segment might stay or shift. Need to check: enemy head at (4,4) now, body: (5,4), \u2026 If enemy moves UP to (4,5), its body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), \u2026] so (5,4) stays as body for 1 more turn. So (5,4) will be enemy body next turn regardless of enemy move (since it grew recently? Actually enemy length 8, if it didn\u2019t eat apple, moving shifts body, so (5,4) becomes second segment, still body). So RIGHT to (5,4) next turn would be unsafe.  \n\nSo from (4,4) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN. LEFT unsafe (my body), RIGHT unsafe (enemy body). Only 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo RIGHT now reduces future options more.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (4,4) likely wants apple at (3,3) too. If I go DOWN to (3,3), enemy could go DOWN to (4,3) this turn, then next turn LEFT to (3,3) but I\u2019d have eaten it. If enemy goes LEFT to (3,4) this turn, then next turn DOWN to (3,3) \u2014 but again I\u2019d have eaten it this turn. So I should grab (3,3) now before enemy can.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4,3) this turn, and I go DOWN to (3,3), we\u2019re adjacent diagonally, no collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on after DOWN:**  \nAfter I eat (3,3), my head at (3,3), enemy could be at (4,3) if it moved DOWN. Then next turn enemy could move LEFT to (3,3) into my body \u2192 enemy dies, good for me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nAfter eating (3,3), I\u2019ll be length 8 vs enemy length 8 (if enemy didn\u2019t eat). Next closest apples: (4,0), (0,8), (8,5), (9,0). (4,0) is close but might be risky with enemy nearby. (0,8) is far but safe area. Could plan to go leftwards after eating (3,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gets apple, grows, keeps 3 safe moves next turn, and possibly lures enemy into suicide later.  \nUP avoids apple but keeps options open.  \nRIGHT reduces future options.  \n\nBest is DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,3), if enemy at (4,3), be careful \u2014 enemy might move LEFT into me next turn (but that kills it). I could go LEFT to (2,3) or DOWN to (3,2) or RIGHT to (4,3) if enemy not there. Prefer to move away from enemy head to avoid head-on risk.  \n\nDOWN",

But I can\u2019t guarantee it.  \nSo RIGHT is *risky* due to possible head-on if enemy moves LEFT.  \n\nBetter to treat RIGHT as unsafe unless I can be sure enemy won\u2019t move LEFT.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s body at (4, 4), (5, 4), etc., enemy\u2019s safe moves from (4, 3):  \nUP (4, 4) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (4, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (3, 3) \u2192 my head (if I stay) or empty (if I move).  \nRIGHT (5, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (3, 3) and I choose RIGHT to (4, 3), we swap positions safely.  \nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (3, 3) and I stay at (3, 3), head-on collision.  \nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (3, 3) and I move elsewhere, enemy goes to empty cell.  \n\nBut from enemy\u2019s perspective, moving LEFT into (3, 3) is dangerous only if I stay. Since I might move, it\u2019s a gamble.  \nGiven the risk, I\u2019ll avoid RIGHT to not gamble on head-on.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (4, 1) is 3 steps away (dx=1, dy=-2).  \n(4, 0) is 4 steps away.  \n(0, 8) far.  \n(8, 5) far.  \n(9, 0) far.  \n\nFrom (3, 3):  \n- DOWN to (3, 2) gets me closer to (4, 1) or (4, 0) via future moves.  \n- LEFT to (2, 3) moves away from those apples but toward left side which is less crowded.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\n**If DOWN to (3, 2):**  \nNew body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)] length 9 (since I didn\u2019t eat apple).  \nNext turn from (3, 2):  \nUP \u2192 (3, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 1): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 2): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 2): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**If LEFT to (2, 3):**  \nNew body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)] length 9.  \nNext turn from (2, 3):  \nUP \u2192 (2, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 2): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 1 safe move (DOWN). That\u2019s very risky \u2014 could trap me next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT is bad for future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (4, 3) likely will move DOWN to (4, 2) to chase apple (4, 1) or (4, 0), or RIGHT to (5, 3) to avoid trap.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 2), then from (3, 2) I\u2019d be adjacent horizontally next turn \u2014 risk of head-on if we move toward each other later. But I can avoid that by moving LEFT or DOWN next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT gives only 1 safe move next turn \u2192 too dangerous.  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward apples.  \nRIGHT is risky due to possible head-on if enemy moves LEFT.  \n\nBest is DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 2), if enemy at (4, 2), avoid moving RIGHT into it. Prefer LEFT to (2, 2) or DOWN to (3, 1) to go toward apple (4, 1) or (4, 0) while keeping distance from enemy head.  \n\nDOWN",

No, enemy would be at (4, 1), I\u2019d be at (4, 2) \u2014 possible head-on if I go DOWN and enemy goes UP same turn. That\u2019s risky.  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 1) and enemy goes DOWN to (4, 1), we are adjacent horizontally \u2014 next turn possible head-on if I go RIGHT and enemy goes LEFT.  \n\nBut if enemy goes LEFT to (3, 2) and I go RIGHT to (4, 2), we swap safely.  \n\nGiven enemy likely wants apple (4, 1), it will probably go DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose safest with apple chance:**  \nDOWN to (3, 1):  \n- Next turn from (3, 1), if enemy at (4, 1), I can avoid RIGHT to (4, 1) if I suspect head-on risk. Instead go LEFT or DOWN to stay safe and maybe get apple later.  \n- More flexible than RIGHT because RIGHT gives fewer safe moves next turn.  \n\nLEFT to (2, 2) avoids conflict but delays apple.  \n\nGiven scores tied (7 apples each), getting apple (4, 1) could give lead, but must survive.  \n\nBest: DOWN to (3, 1), then next turn assess: if enemy at (4, 1), I can go LEFT to (2, 1) or DOWN to (3, 0) to avoid collision and target apple (4, 0) instead.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 1), check enemy head position. If enemy at (4, 1), avoid moving RIGHT unless sure no head-on. Prefer DOWN to (3, 0) for apple (4, 0) or LEFT to (2, 1) to stay safe.  \n\nDOWN",

If the enemy tries to move RIGHT into (4,1) on the same turn, they would move into my body and die.

No, must choose a direction; if all moves kill it, it dies before I move into its cell? Actually, if enemy has no safe moves, it dies immediately at start of turn, so cell becomes empty before movement. But here enemy has safe moves.)  \n\nEnemy at (4, 1) possible moves:  \nUP (4, 2): its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (4, 0): empty, apple at (4, 0).  \nLEFT (3, 1): my head (if I stay) \u2192 would cause head-on collision if I stay, but if I move away, it\u2019s empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 1): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 1) and I move RIGHT to (4, 1), we swap safely.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 1) and I stay at (3, 1), head-on collision \u2192 I die.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 1) and I move DOWN/LEFT, no collision.  \n\nThus RIGHT is *immediately safe* because enemy won\u2019t be in (4, 1) after moving unless enemy chooses to stay (impossible) or moves RIGHT then LEFT back (impossible in one turn).  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each move:**  \n\n**If DOWN to (3, 0):**  \nNew body: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)] length 9.  \nFrom (3, 0) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (3, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board (y = -1) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 0): apple (4, 0) \u2192 safe (empty before eating).  \nSo 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**If LEFT to (2, 1):**  \nNew body: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)] length 9.  \nFrom (2, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (2, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (4, 1):**  \nNew body: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)] length 9.  \nFrom (4, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (4, 2): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4, 0): apple (4, 0) \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5, 1): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nSo LEFT gives the most safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (4, 0) is 1 step from (4, 1) or (3, 0).  \nFrom (3, 1):  \n- DOWN to (3, 0): then RIGHT to (4, 0) next turn gets apple.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 1): then DOWN to (4, 0) next turn gets apple.  \n- LEFT to (2, 1): moves away from nearest apples.  \n\nBut enemy at (4, 1) likely wants apple (4, 0) too \u2014 will probably go DOWN to (4, 0) this turn.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 0), apple will be gone before I get there next turn.  \n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (4, 1) and enemy goes DOWN to (4, 0), we are adjacent vertically; next turn if I go DOWN to (4, 0), enemy might move away, but if enemy stays at (4, 0) and I go there, head-on.  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 0) and enemy goes DOWN to (4, 0), we are adjacent horizontally; next turn if I go RIGHT to (4, 0), enemy could move LEFT to (3, 0) \u2192 head-on.  \n\nThus competing for (4, 0) is risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \nLEFT to (2, 1) gives more future options and avoids immediate conflict.  \nFrom (2, 1), I can target apples (0, 8) or (0, 9) later via leftward movement, or go down toward (9, 0) eventually.  \n\nEnemy is longer (9 segments) and may be more constrained soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT is safest now, preserves flexibility, avoids head-on risk with enemy who likely goes DOWN for apple (4, 0).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 1), assess enemy position. If enemy ate (4, 0), it will be at (4, 0) or moved away. Consider moving toward bottom-left apples or up toward (0, 8)/(0, 9) while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

Possible moves for enemy:  \nUP \u2192 (5, 1): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 0): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 0): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 1), it\u2019s moving toward apple (4, 5) area. If enemy goes RIGHT to (6, 0), it\u2019s moving toward apple (9, 0).  \n\nClosest apples to me:  \n- (0, 8) and (0, 9) are far top left.  \n- (9, 0) is far bottom right.  \n- (8, 5) is far right middle.  \n- (4, 5) is near enemy\u2019s body.  \n\nFrom (0, 1), I can go DOWN to (0, 0) then up the left edge toward (0, 8)/(0, 9) safely.  \n\nFrom (1, 0), I can go LEFT to (0, 0) then up left edge.  \n\nFrom (1, 2), I can go LEFT to (0, 2) then up left edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoiding enemy head-on risk:**  \n\nEnemy could go UP to (5, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 0). Neither threatens me directly this turn.  \n\nBut if I go DOWN to (1, 0), enemy could go RIGHT to (6, 0) \u2014 still far away.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 1), enemy is far.  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 2), enemy is far.  \n\nAll are safe from immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nI want to collect apples while staying safe. The top-left apples (0, 8) and (0, 9) are reachable via left edge. Going LEFT now positions me to go DOWN next turn to (0, 0) and start moving up the left column.  \n\nGoing UP now to (1, 2) also allows moving left to (0, 2) next turn, but then I\u2019m higher up left edge \u2014 still okay.  \n\nBut going DOWN to (1, 0) then LEFT to (0, 0) is also fine.  \n\nI think LEFT now is slightly better because it gets me to the left edge immediately, maximizing distance from enemy who is on the right side.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 1), go DOWN to (0, 0) to start ascending left edge toward (0, 8)/(0, 9). Avoid moving right into center until necessary.  \n\nLEFT",

More flexibility but no immediate apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting and enemy risk:**\n\nEnemy head at (8, 1). Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 0): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 1): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\nEnemy could go to (8, 2) or (7, 1). Both are far from me currently.\n\nClosest apples to me:  \n- (0, 8) and (0, 9) are above me along left edge.  \n- (5, 7) is far.  \n- (4, 5) is near enemy\u2019s body (dangerous).  \n- (8, 5) far right.\n\nFrom (0, 7) after UP, I can go UP again to (0, 8) apple next turn. That\u2019s a clear safe path away from enemy.  \nFrom (1, 6) after RIGHT, I\u2019m moving toward center but away from the left-edge apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan:**\n\nEnemy is longer (11 vs my 9 after growth), so avoid head-on collisions.  \nStaying left edge is safe from enemy for several turns.  \nUP continues toward apples (0, 8) and (0, 9) with minimal risk.  \nRIGHT gives more next-turn flexibility but moves me toward enemy territory and away from immediate apples.\n\nGiven enemy will likely move UP or LEFT, it\u2019s moving up or left from (8, 1), still far from me.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 7), go UP to (0, 8) apple if possible.

That\u2019s a dead-end situation \u2014 I\u2019d be forced RIGHT next turn, possibly into danger.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (1, 8):**  \nNo apple, no growth. New body: head (1, 8), then (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1).  \nFrom (1, 8) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (1, 9): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 7): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 8): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 8): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Much more flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy risk:**  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 3). Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 4): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 2): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 3): empty.  \nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nEnemy could go to (8, 4) toward apple (8, 5), or elsewhere. Far from me currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nUP gets an apple (9 total vs enemy\u2019s 10), but traps me at (0, 9) with only RIGHT next turn \u2014 that\u2019s risky if enemy approaches or if (1, 9) becomes dangerous.  \n\nRIGHT avoids immediate apple but keeps options open and lets me maneuver toward other apples (e.g., (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 7)) from a safer central position.  \n\nGiven enemy is ahead in apples, I need to survive to catch up. Being trapped in a corner after eating (0, 9) could end my game soon.  \n\nBetter to stay flexible, move RIGHT now, then plan to go toward (4, 5) or (5, 5) next turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 8), consider moving DOWN to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 8) to approach center apples while avoiding enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \n\nClosest apples to me:  \n- (0, 9) \u2013 2 steps away (UP then LEFT), but after eating it I\u2019d be trapped at (0, 9) with only RIGHT safe next turn.  \n- (1, 6) \u2013 3 steps away (DOWN twice then LEFT).  \n- (4, 5), (5, 5) \u2013 4\u20135 steps away.  \n\n(1, 6) is appealing because it\u2019s close and not in a dead-end.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (2, 7), next turn I can go LEFT to (1, 7) and then DOWN to (1, 6) to eat apple. That path seems safe and keeps options open after eating (1, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nEnemy has 11 apples, I have 8. Need to catch up safely.  \nAvoid going UP now because it leads toward (0, 9) trap.  \nRIGHT is safe but moves me away from (1, 6).  \nDOWN is safe and moves me toward (1, 6) and also toward central apples (4,5), (5,5) via a safer route (avoid enemy territory on right side).  \n\nFrom (2, 7), I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves next turn, so flexibility remains.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7), go LEFT to (1, 7) to set up eating (1, 6) the turn after, unless enemy movement changes risk.  \n\nDOWN",

Eating at (5,5) next turn is likely and desirable.\n- I must avoid hugging the right column (x=8) where my body lies; LEFT continues to move away from that crowded column.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move LEFT to (6,5), then LEFT again to (5,5) to eat the apple.

Wait, I have 10 apples, so length = 10 + 1 initial = 11 segments total. Yes, so tail is at (0, 8) now, but after moving without eating, tail moves to (1, 3) next turn.  \nFrom (1, 0) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 0): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \nSo safe next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n**If LEFT to (0, 1) (no apple):**  \nNo growth, tail moves to (1, 3).  \nBody: head (0, 1), then (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), \u2026 (0, 8).  \nFrom (0, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (0, 2): apple there, but check if body: (0, 2) not in body after tail moves? Tail moves to (1, 3), so (0, 2) is free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (0, 0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe next turn: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (2, 1) (no apple):**  \nNo growth, tail moves to (1, 3).  \nFrom (2, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (2, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 1): empty.  \nSo safe next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (6, 7). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 8): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 6): apple there \u2192 likely choice for enemy.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 7): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 7): empty.  \n\nEnemy could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \nManhattan distance from my head (1, 1) to enemy head (6, 7) is 11, so no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and future flexibility:**  \n\nApples: (0, 9) far, (9, 6) far, (0, 2) reachable soon, (4, 1) reachable, (6, 6) enemy may eat.  \n\nRIGHT gives 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward center and toward apple (4, 1) eventually.  \nLEFT gives 2 safe moves, but puts me near apple (0, 2) next turn (from (0, 1), UP to (0, 2) eats apple).  \nDOWN gives only 2 safe moves and traps me along bottom edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nEnemy is longer (14 vs my 11). Need to collect apples safely without getting trapped.  \nRIGHT seems best for keeping options open.  \nLEFT lets me get apple (0, 2) next turn safely if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.  \n\nCheck: If I go LEFT to (0, 1), enemy might move toward (6, 6) apple, not toward me. From (0, 1) next turn, I can eat apple (0, 2) and grow, which gives more space.  \n\nBut eating apple (0, 2) from (0, 1) means next turn after eating:  \nFrom (0, 2) after growth (tail still at old tail until move after eating), safe moves? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 1) now, next turn UP to (0, 2) eats apple, length becomes 12, body: head (0, 2), then (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), \u2026 (0, 8) plus new segment at tail? Actually eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so tail stays at (1, 3) until next move after eating. So from (0, 2) after eating, safe moves: UP (0, 3) empty, DOWN (0, 1) body (yes, body from last turn\u2019s position (0, 1) is now behind head), so DOWN unsafe, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 2) body. So only UP is safe \u2192 dangerous. So eating (0, 2) from left approach traps me next turn.  \n\nSo maybe avoid that.  \n\nRIGHT to (2, 1) keeps 3 options next turn, I can then go UP to (2, 2), then (2, 3), etc., working toward apple (4, 1) from above safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nRIGHT gives most future flexibility and avoids dead ends.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 1), choose among UP, DOWN, RIGHT based on enemy position. Aim to approach apple (4, 1) via a safe path, maybe (2, 1) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 DOWN to (4, 1).  \n\nRIGHT",

Tail is (2,8).  \n\nFrom (3, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (3, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 1): apple there, not in body.  \nSo safe next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (6, 6). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 7): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 5): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 6): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 6): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can only go LEFT or RIGHT. Manhattan distance from my head (2,1) to enemy (6,6) is 9, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (4, 1) \u2013 2 steps away (RIGHT then RIGHT from (2,1)).  \n- (1, 0) \u2013 2 steps away (DOWN then LEFT from (2,1)).  \n- (0, 2) \u2013 farther.  \n\nRIGHT to (3,1) puts me one step from apple (4,1) with 3 safe moves next turn, so I can eat it safely if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.  \nDOWN to (2,0) puts me one step from apple (1,0) with 2 safe moves next turn, but after eating (1,0), I\u2019d be at (1,0) with growth, tail still at (2,8), body behind me at (2,0) and (2,1), etc. That might trap me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \n\nEnemy is longer (16 vs my 11). Need to avoid being trapped.  \nRIGHT gives most options next turn (3 safe moves).  \nUP gives only 2 safe moves and leads toward top where my body is.  \nDOWN gives 2 safe moves and leads to bottom edge.  \n\nRIGHT seems best for flexibility and moving toward apple (4,1).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,1), if apple (4,1) still there, consider RIGHT to eat it, but check enemy\u2019s possible moves: enemy might go LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6), not toward (4,1) immediately. So likely safe to eat next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

Tail becomes (1, 2).  \n\nFrom (6, 3) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 4): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 3): empty.  \nSafe next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (2, 8): distance |5-2| + |3-8| = 3 + 5 = 8  \n- (0, 2): 5 + 1 = 6  \n- (1, 0): 4 + 3 = 7  \n- (6, 9): 1 + 6 = 7  \n- (0, 9): 5 + 6 = 11  \n\n(0, 2) is closest but blocked by my body along x=1, y=1\u20136. To get there, need to go around via left side, which is tight.  \n\n(6, 9) is far up but reachable via RIGHT then UP later.  \n\n(2, 8) is far but could be reached via UP then LEFT over several moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (9, 8). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (9, 9): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 7): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 8): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or LEFT. Manhattan distance to me is |5-9| + |3-8| = 4 + 5 = 9, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \n\nEnemy is longer (17 vs my 12). My body blocks left side (x=1). Right side is more open. Enemy\u2019s body is mostly in columns 4\u20139, rows 2\u20137, but my current position (5,3) is near that cluster.  \n\nUP to (5,4) puts me near enemy body at (5,5) and only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN to (5,2) only 2 safe moves next turn and near enemy body at (4,5)\u2013(8,5) region.  \nRIGHT to (6,3) gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward open column 6\u20139 top apples later.  \n\nRIGHT seems best for keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo RIGHT to (6,3) \u2014 keeps future flexibility, avoids immediate danger, positions for (6,9) later.  \n\nRIGHT",

After moving without eating apple, tail moves to (1, 1) (since body list order: head moves, last segment removed).  \n\n**If UP to (8, 5):**  \nNew body: (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) removed.

Path: from (8, 4), UP to (8, 5), then LEFT to (7, 5), then LEFT to (6, 5) \u2014 but (6, 5) is enemy body. So need to go around.  \n\nActually, (5, 6) is directly above (5, 5) which is enemy body. Enemy body occupies (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), etc. So (5, 6) is adjacent to enemy body at (5, 5) and (4, 6), but not occupied yet.  \n\nEnemy head at (6, 9) is far from (5, 6) for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (6, 9). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 10) off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 8): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 9): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 9): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6, 8), distance to me at (8, 4): 2 + 4 = 6.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5, 9), distance to me: 3 + 5 = 8.  \n\nNo immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety and plan:**  \n\nEnemy is longer (17 apples vs my 11). I should avoid getting trapped near its body.  \nUP to (8, 5) keeps me in open area, moves toward (5, 6) from the right side (safer than going left into its body zone).  \nLEFT to (7, 4) moves closer to my own body constraints and reduces future options.  \nRIGHT to (9, 4) moves to edge, fewer options next turn.  \n\nBest choice: UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 5), consider moving toward (5, 6) via (8, 6) or (7, 5) depending on enemy\u2019s new position. Keep distance from enemy body at (6, 5)\u2013(7, 5)\u2013(8, 6) area.  \n\nUP",

Tail at (2,1).  \n\nFrom (8, 6) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 7): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 6): enemy body (grid shows T at (7,6)) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 6): empty.  \nSafe next turn: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n**If LEFT to (7, 5):**  \nNew body: (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1).  \n\nFrom (7, 5) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (7, 6): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 4): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 5): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe next turn: DOWN only (1 option).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (9, 5):**  \nNew body: (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1).  \n\nFrom (9, 5) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (9, 6): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 4): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 5): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (10, 5) off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe next turn: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT give 2 future safe moves, LEFT gives only 1.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \n\nClosest apple is (5, 6) at Manhattan distance |8-5| + |5-6| = 3 + 1 = 4 from (8, 5).  \nPath: need to go LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT, but (7, 6) and (6, 5) are enemy body, so direct path blocked.  \nFrom (8, 5):  \n- UP to (8, 6) \u2192 then maybe RIGHT to (9, 6) \u2192 then DOWN to (9, 5) \u2192 then LEFT to (8, 5) is a loop, not toward apple. Actually (8, 6) to (7, 6) is enemy body, so can\u2019t go directly toward apple from (8, 6) except via (8, 7) then around.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 5) \u2192 then UP to (9, 6) \u2192 then LEFT to (8, 6) same issue.  \n\nSo apple (5, 6) is near enemy body, risky to go directly.  \n\nOther apples are far: (2, 8) distance 6, (0, 9) distance 8, (0, 2) distance 11, (1, 0) distance 12.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (5, 9). Possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (5, 10) off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 8): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 9): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 9): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5, 8), distance to me at (8, 5): 3 + 3 = 6.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4, 9), distance: 4 + 4 = 8.  \n\nNo immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \n\nEnemy is longer (17 apples vs my 11). I should avoid getting near its body.  \nUP to (8, 6) puts me adjacent to enemy body at (7, 6) and (8, 6) is empty now, but next turn LEFT from (8, 6) is blocked by enemy. Still, UP gives future options UP or RIGHT.  \nRIGHT to (9, 5) is near board edge but safe for now.  \n\nLEFT to (7, 5) is surrounded: UP and LEFT blocked by enemy, DOWN and RIGHT blocked by my body next turn \u2192 risky.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP moves toward top edge but away from my body cluster.  \nRIGHT moves to right edge but keeps more space from enemy body.  \n\nActually, from (9, 5), next turn I can go UP to (9, 6) or DOWN to (9, 4). From (9, 6), I could later go LEFT to (8, 6) if enemy moves away.  \n\nBut UP to (8, 6) also okay. Let\u2019s check immediate danger: enemy could move DOWN to (5, 8) then next turn be closer, but still not adjacent.  \n\nI think UP is slightly better because it keeps me closer to center than RIGHT (which traps me on edge).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 6), check if (7, 6) is still enemy body; if yes, avoid LEFT. Consider moving UP to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 6) to stay safe and circle toward apples (2, 8) or (0, 9) eventually. Avoid enemy body cluster around cols 4\u20137, rows 5\u20137.  \n\nUP",
