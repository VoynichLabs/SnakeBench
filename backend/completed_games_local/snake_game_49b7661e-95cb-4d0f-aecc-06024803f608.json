There's an apple at (6, 9) which is just one move to the left - this is very tempting\n2. However, I need to consider what enemy snake #0 might do\n3. Snake #0 at (6, 6) could potentially move UP to (6, 7), (6, 8), or (6, 9) if they choose to move up multiple times\n4. Moving LEFT to eat the apple at (6, 9) is safe for this turn since enemy snake #0 would need to move up 3 times to reach that apple\n5. Moving LEFT also puts me closer to other apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9) on the same row\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT to (6, 9) to eat the apple is the best move. It's immediately safe, gives me 1 point, and positions me well for future apple collection along the top row.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 9), I should consider moving left along the top row to collect the remaining apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9), while keeping an eye on enemy snake #0's movements. The apple at (6, 1) is far away and might be risky to pursue.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (6,6) with no body yet (only head).\n- Apples are at (3,9), (9,8), (6,9), (1,9), (6,1).\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (7,9) with no body.\n\n**Potential moves from (6,6):**\n- UP: (6,7)\n- DOWN: (6,5)\n- LEFT: (5,6)\n- RIGHT: (7,6)\n\n**Check for immediate death:**\n- None of these moves go off the board (all within 0-9).\n- My snake has no body yet, so no self-collision risk (even backwards is safe since there's no tail).\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (7,9), far away. Its possible moves: from (7,9) it can go UP (7,10) [invalid], DOWN (7,8), LEFT (6,9), RIGHT (8,9). So it might move to (6,9) which has an apple, or (7,8) or (8,9). There is no risk of head-on collision with me this turn because my head is at (6,6) and all my moves are to adjacent cells that are not (7,9) or its possible moves.\n\nTherefore, all moves are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe should consider getting apples and future options.\n\nApples:\n- (6,9) is directly above me (same x, y=9). From (6,6) to (6,9) is 3 steps up.\n- (6,1) is directly below (same x, y=1). From (6,6) to (6,1) is 5 steps down.\n- Other apples are far.\n\nSo going UP brings me closer to (6,9). Also, (6,9) is adjacent to enemy snake #1 at (7,9). The enemy might go to (6,9) to eat it (if it chooses LEFT). So if I go UP, I can potentially race for that apple.\n\nBut note: if I go UP one step to (6,7), I'm still 2 steps away from (6,9). The enemy is only 1 step away from (6,9) (if it goes LEFT). So it will likely get that apple first. However, if the enemy doesn't go LEFT (it might go DOWN or RIGHT), I might have a chance.\n\nAlternatively, going DOWN towards (6,1) is safer because no enemy is near. But it's farther.\n\nAlso, consider future options: from (6,7), I can go UP again to (6,8), then (6,9). Or left/right to avoid if needed. From (6,5), I can go further down to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut since the enemy is near (6,9), it might be risky to compete for that apple. However, if I don't go for it, the enemy will likely get it and grow.\n\nAnother idea: I can go RIGHT to (7,6). This doesn't directly go towards an apple, but it opens more options. But it doesn't help immediately.\n\nGiven that I have no body, I am very flexible. I should avoid direct confrontation with the enemy since it's equally sized.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple that is uncontested: (6,1) is below, and no enemy is near. So going DOWN might be good to secure that apple safely.\n\nAlso, (6,1) is 5 steps away, but if I go DOWN repeatedly, I can get it in 5 turns. Meanwhile, the enemy might get (6,9) and then other apples.\n\nBut to avoid risk, going DOWN is safe and gets me an apple without competition.\n\nAlternatively, LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6) are neutral moves that don't progress towards an apple quickly.\n\nSo best is to go DOWN towards (6,1).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move DOWN to secure the apple at (6,1) without competition.\n- Avoid the enemy near the top until I have more size.\n- After eating (6,1), consider other apples like (9,8) or (3,9) while avoiding enemy.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN moves me away from the top row apples but gives me more flexibility\n\n**Enemy snake #0 analysis:**\n- Snake #0 is at (6, 3) with no body segments\n- From (6, 3), they can move: UP to (6, 4), DOWN to (6, 2), LEFT to (5, 3), or RIGHT to (7, 3)\n- The apple at (6, 1) is directly below me, and enemy snake #0 could potentially move UP and then DOWN to get it\n- The apple at (9, 3) could be a target if they move RIGHT and then down\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- DOWN to (4, 8): This moves me away from the top row apples but gives me more flexibility.

It moves me directly onto an apple, which would give me 2 apples total and maintain my lead. This is the most direct path to collect another apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving left along the top row to collect the apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9) on the top row. This gives me a clear path with minimal risk of collision with enemy snake #0. After collecting these apples, I can assess the board state and decide whether to go for the apple at (9, 8) or (9, 3) based on enemy snake #0's movements. I should avoid moving down into the board where enemy snake #0 is positioned, as this could lead to a head-on collision or getting into a more defensive position.\n\nLEFT",

So moving DOWN would get me to (6,2) and then to (6,1) next turn if I continue DOWN.\n- The enemy is at the top (y=9) and far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nNow, consider all moves:\n\nUP: to (6,4) - safe (empty), but moves away from the apple at (6,1).\nDOWN: to (6,2) - safe (empty), and towards the apple at (6,1).\nLEFT: to (5,3) - safe (empty), but not directly towards any apple.\nRIGHT: to (7,3) - safe (empty), but not directly towards any apple.\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no bodies nearby and I won't go off the board.\n\nHowever, the apple at (6,1) is very close. Moving DOWN gets me closer to it. Since the enemy is far and I have no body, I can safely go for it.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (9,3) is to the right, but it's 3 steps away (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT) while (6,1) is 2 steps away (DOWN, DOWN). So DOWN is more efficient.\n\nLong-term: After eating the apple at (6,1), I'll grow to length 2. Then I can consider other apples. The enemy has a head start (1 apple already), so I need to catch up.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to get the closest apple quickly.\n\nDOWN",

Apples are at (9,8), (9,3), (2,4), (7,2), (0,5).\n\nSafe moves check:\n- UP: (9,3) - contains an apple! This is safe to move into. Even though it will become my body next turn, I'm not moving into my current body (which is at (8,2)), so it's valid.\n- DOWN: (9,1) - currently empty and safe.\n- LEFT: (8,2) - this is my current body segment. Moving left would be moving backwards into my own body, which is illegal and would kill me. Eliminate.\n- RIGHT: Off the board (x=10). Eliminate.\n\nSo only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nNow, UP leads directly to an apple at (9,3). Eating this apple would give me 2 apples (total 3, tying snake #1's score) and grow my length by 1. This is highly advantageous.\n\nDOWN to (9,1) is safe but doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately. The apple at (9,8) is far up, and (7,2) is behind me but that space will be vacated by my tail? Actually, my tail is at (8,2) and will move when I do, but (7,2) has an apple but is currently occupied by my own body? Looking at the board: my snake is represented by '0' at (9,2) head, 'T' at (8,2) body. The apple at (7,2) is shown as 'A' at (7,2), but note that my body segment is at (8,2), so (7,2) is actually empty and has an apple. However, moving DOWN doesn't get me closer to (7,2); it would require LEFT next turn, which might be risky if my body is there.\n\nBut UP is clearly better: immediate apple capture. Also, after eating, my head will be at (9,3), and my body will be at (9,2) and (8,2). Then I can consider moving UP further to (9,4) toward (9,8), or LEFT to (8,3), etc.\n\nNo risk from enemy snake: it is at (0,7) and moving in that area, no threat to me.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to get the apple safely.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START PLAN**\nShort-term: Move UP to eat the apple at (9,3). This ties the score with snake #1. Then plan to move toward the apple at (9,8) by going UP, but check for safe paths avoiding potential traps.

Moving backwards would kill me. Eliminate.\n- LEFT: (8,3) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: Off the board (x=10). Eliminate.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\nApples: (9,8), (2,4), (7,2), (0,5). \n- UP moves me toward (9,8), which is valuable and in a clear path along the top edge.\n- LEFT moves me toward the center, but (7,2) is below and would require DOWN later, which might be blocked by my body? Also, (2,4) is far and enemy is near there.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,7). It might move toward (2,4) or (0,5). Since it has a long body, it may be constrained.\n\nConsidering future moves:\n- If I go UP to (9,4), next turn I can go UP to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,4). This keeps me near the top and progressing toward (9,8).\n- If I go LEFT to (8,3), next turn I could go DOWN to (8,2) but that is currently my tail? Actually, my tail is at (8,2) but it will move when I do. After I move, my tail will shift: my new body will be (9,3) head, (9,2) segment, and (8,2) tail. So (8,2) becomes free? Not exactly: when I move without eating, the tail moves forward. But I just ate an apple, so I don't lose the tail. Actually, after eating, the tail doesn't move; the snake grows. So my body is now 3 segments: head at (9,3), then (9,2), then (8,2). The tail remains at (8,2) until I move without eating.\n\nSo if I go LEFT to (8,3), that is safe. Then next turn, if I go DOWN to (8,2), that is currently my tail? But after this move, the tail will still be at (8,2) only if I don't eat. Actually, since I just ate, the tail doesn't advance. So (8,2) is occupied by my body and will be for a while. Therefore, moving DOWN from (8,3) to (8,2) would be into my own body and kill me next turn. So LEFT leads to a potential trap: from (8,3), only UP and LEFT might be safe, but DOWN would be dangerous.\n\nGoing UP to (9,4) is safer for future options: from (9,4), I can go UP to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,4), both likely safe.\n\nAlso, going UP directly toward (9,8) is efficient. The enemy is not near me.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to progress toward the apple and avoid future traps.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START PLAN**\nAfter moving UP to (9,4), continue moving UP along the top edge to reach (9,8). Be cautious near the top-left corner where enemy snake #1 is active. Avoid moving into confined spaces without exits. Monitor enemy movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n**END PLAN**\n\nUP",

Eating it would grow me to length 4.\n- DOWN: (9, 6) \u2014 my body, unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8, 7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2014 unsafe.\n\nSo possible moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n**Apple at (9,8):** This is directly above me. Eating it is highly beneficial: I gain an apple and grow, and it's the closest one.\n\n**Enemy #1 (ID 1):**\nHead: (0, 6)\nBody: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)]\nIt is far away (left side of board). Its potential moves from (0,6):\n- UP: (0,7) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN: (0,5) \u2014 its body? Actually (0,5) is its first body segment (behind head), so DOWN is unsafe.\n- LEFT: off board\n- RIGHT: (1,6) \u2014 its body (third segment), unsafe.\nSo enemy can only go UP to (0,7). It cannot threaten me this turn.\n\n**If I go UP to (9,8):**\n- I eat the apple, growing to length 4 (head at (9,8), body becomes [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5)]).\n- Next turn, from (9,8), safe moves would likely be LEFT (to (8,8)) or DOWN (to (9,7) but that is my body? Actually after eating, my tail doesn't move until the next move, so after eating at (9,8), my body is still [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5)] so DOWN to (9,7) is unsafe. So only LEFT is safe? But wait: after eating, the tail doesn't advance until the next move. So when I move to (9,8) and eat, the snake becomes: head at (9,8), then segments (9,7), (9,6), (9,5). Then when I move next turn, the tail will stay put? Actually no: in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the move. So after moving to (9,8) and eating, the body becomes [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5)] (same as before because the tail didn't move). Then next turn, when I move from (9,8), the tail will not advance (because I grew, so the tail remains). So from (9,8), next turn:\n  - DOWN: (9,7) is my body (unsafe)\n  - LEFT: (8,8) is empty (safe)\n  - RIGHT: off board\n  - UP: off board\nSo only LEFT is safe. That would trap me along the top edge. However, I can plan to go left along the top and then down later. It's manageable.\n\n**If I go LEFT to (8,7):**\n- I don't eat an apple.\n- Next turn, from (8,7), I have more options: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7) but (9,7) is my body? Actually my body is [(9,6), (9,5)], so (9,7) is free? Wait, my current body is [(9,6), (9,5)]. So (9,7) is empty. So from (8,7), all directions except possibly into myself? Actually:\n  - UP: (8,8) empty\n  - DOWN: (8,6) empty\n  - LEFT: (7,7) empty\n  - RIGHT: (9,7) empty (since I moved away)\nSo going LEFT gives more future options. But I miss the immediate apple.\n\n**Comparison:**\nGoing UP gives me an apple and a point, but limits my next move to only LEFT (which is safe but reduces options). Going LEFT gives no apple but keeps multiple options open.\n\nHowever, since the enemy has 4 apples (I have 2), I need to catch up. Also, the apple at (9,8) is very close and low-risk. Even though it restricts my next move, I can handle it by going left along the top and then down when possible. Also, the enemy is far and not threatening.\n\n**Safety note:** Both moves are safe this turn. UP is safe because (9,8) has an apple (so no snake body there) and is on board. LEFT is safe.\n\n**Final choice:** I should take the apple to gain points and grow. The temporary reduction in options is acceptable given the gain.\n\n**START PLAN**\nMove UP to (9,8) to eat the apple. Next turn, I must go LEFT to (8,8) (only safe move). Then from (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8), etc. I should plan to work my way down the left side to access other apples. Enemy #1 is on the left, so be cautious when moving leftward.\n**END PLAN**\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n**My snake (ID 0):**\nHead: (9, 8)\nBody: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5)]\nApples collected: 3\n\n**Safe moves from (9,8):**\n- UP: (9, 9) \u2014 off board? y=9 is top edge, so (9,9) is valid (top-right). Currently empty? Board shows at (0,9) there is an apple, but (9,9) is not listed as having an apple or snake. From board state: row 9 has \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so (9,9) is actually the first cell in that row? Wait: coordinates: (0,9) to (9,9). The board display:\n  9 A . . . . . . . . .   -> this means: (0,9)=A, (1,9)=., (2,9)=., ... (9,9)=.\nSo (9,9) is empty. But it is on board.\n- DOWN: (9, 7) \u2014 my body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (8, 8) \u2014 empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10, unsafe)\n\nSo possible moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n**Apples:** There are apples at (2,4), (7,2), (5,2), (1,1), (0,9). The closest is (0,9) at top-left, but I am at top-right. To reach it, I need to go left along the top row.\n\n**Enemy #1 (ID 1):**\nHead: (0, 7)\nBody: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\nApples: 4 (one more than me)\n\nFrom its head (0,7), possible moves:\n- UP: (0,8) \u2014 empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (0,6) \u2014 its body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,7) \u2014 empty? Board shows at (1,7): row 7 has \"1 . . . . . . . . .\" so (1,7) is empty? Actually the \"1\" is at (0,7) (head of snake1). So (1,7) is safe.\nSo enemy can go UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7).\n\n**If I go UP to (9,9):**\n- I don't eat an apple (since (9,9) is empty).\n- Next turn, from (9,9), safe moves would be only LEFT (to (8,9)) because:\n  - DOWN: (9,8) is my body (unsafe)\n  - RIGHT: off board\n  - UP: off board\nSo I would be trapped at the top-right corner with only one move (LEFT).\n\n**If I go LEFT to (8,8):**\n- I don't eat an apple (empty).\n- Next turn, from (8,8), safe moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8). All are empty. So I have multiple options.\n\n**Comparison:**\nGoing UP leads to a dead-end next turn (only LEFT available). Going LEFT keeps multiple options open and allows me to progress along the top row towards the apple at (0,9).\n\n**Safety note:** Both moves are safe this turn. However, going UP is risky because it immediately restricts my next move to only one option, which might be dangerous if the enemy approaches. Going LEFT is better for flexibility.\n\n**Enemy behavior:** The enemy is at (0,7) and might move UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7). It is heading towards the top-left apple (0,9). So if I go left along the top, I might eventually meet the enemy. But for now, it is far.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I should move left along the top row to collect the apple at (0,9). This will require several moves: first to (8,8), then (7,8), etc. I need to be cautious of the enemy also moving towards (0,9). Alternatively, I can consider going down from (8,8) to access other apples later.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT is the better move because it maintains flexibility and avoids getting trapped. I can then plan to go to (8,8) and then either continue left or go down to access the apples at (7,2) or (5,2). The enemy has more apples, so I need to collect safely.\n\n**START PLAN**\nMove LEFT to (8,8). Next turn, from (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8) to continue towards the apple at (0,9), or DOWN to (8,7) to start descending. Since enemy #1 is also heading towards (0,9), I should monitor its position. Alternatively, I can go down to avoid head-on collision and target the apples at (7,2) or (5,2). My priority is to collect apples safely without dying.\n**END PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- **Apple Proximity:** The apple at (7,2) is directly below me. Moving DOWN twice (to (7,3), then (7,2)) is the most direct path to capture it. The apple at (5,2) is also in that general area. The apple at (6,6) is above me, but getting there would require a less efficient path right now.\n- **Enemy Position:** Enemy #1 is at (3,4). They are two moves away from a head-on collision if we both move LEFT. If I move LEFT to (6,4), they could move RIGHT to (4,4) and then we could collide on the next turn if we both move towards (5,4). Moving DOWN avoids this potential conflict entirely.\n- **Future Mobility:** Moving DOWN to (7,3) gives me excellent options. From there, I can continue DOWN to get the apple at (7,2), or go LEFT/RIGHT to approach (5,2) or (6,6). It keeps me in the open area of the board.\n- **Head-on Collision Risk:** The immediate risk is low, but moving LEFT creates a potential future risk. DOWN is safer in this regard.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN remains the best move. It directly progresses toward the high-priority apple at (7,2), avoids potential conflict with the enemy, and maintains strong future mobility.\n\n**RATIONALE**\nContinue executing the plan to secure the bottom apples. Priority is the apple at (7,2). Move DOWN to get directly closer. Avoid lateral moves that bring me closer to the enemy's path unnecessarily. After eating (7,2), assess the path to (5,2).\n\nDOWN",

There is no immediate collision risk. My move to (7,2) places me further from the enemy and in a safe corner of the board.\n- **Future Mobility:** After eating the apple, my tail will remain at (7,6) (since eating adds a segment to the tail). My new head will be at (7,2), with my body from (7,3) to (7,6). From (7,2), I can consider moving LEFT towards the other apple at (5,2) or potentially RIGHT to explore the right side of the board.

It is a guaranteed point and puts me in a strong position to pursue the next closest apple.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the best move. It secures an apple, increases my score, and maintains good future options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,2), assess the path to (5,2). Consider moving LEFT to (6,2) as a next step, but also evaluate the safety relative to the enemy's new position.

Apples are at (5,2), (1,1), (0,9), (6,6). Enemy Snake #1 head is at (5,3), body at [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)].\n\n**Safety check for each direction from (6,2):**\n- **UP**: (6,3) - Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN**: (6,1) - Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT**: (5,2) - Contains an apple, and is not occupied by any snake body. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT**: (7,2) - My own body segment. **UNSAFE**.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- **Apple Proximity:** The apple at (5,2) is directly to my LEFT. This is a guaranteed safe capture.\n- **Enemy Position:** The enemy head at (5,3) is directly above the apple. They could move DOWN to (5,2) on this turn.\n    - If we both move to (5,2), it's a head-on collision and we both die. Snake #1 has 5 apples, I have 4. If we both die, they win. **This is extremely risky.**\n- **Avoiding Risk:** While capturing the apple is my goal, a direct confrontation where I lose is not acceptable. I must avoid a collision.\n- **Alternative Moves:** Moving UP or DOWN are safe and keep me alive. Moving UP to (6,3) is interesting; it puts me one space away from the enemy but also one space away from the apple at (6,6). Moving DOWN to (6,1) moves me towards the apple at (1,1) and away from the immediate threat.\n- **Enemy's Likely Move:** The enemy will also see the apple. Their safe moves from (5,3) are UP (5,4) is their body, so UNSAFE), DOWN (to the apple, but risk collision with me), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3). They might avoid DOWN due to the collision risk with me, or they might take the risk hoping I don't go for it. It's a gamble.\n\n**Conclusion:** The safest and most strategic move is to avoid the potential head-on collision. The risk of dying and losing the game is too high. I will move DOWN to (6,1). This positions me to safely pursue the apple at (1,1) and gives me time to assess the enemy's next move. Let Snake #1 have the (5,2) apple if they dare take it; I can outmaneuver them later.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6,1), my goal will be to head towards the apple at (1,1) or (6,6), while monitoring the enemy's position. The priority is to stay alive and collect apples safely, not to engage in risky confrontations when I am behind on apples.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

If it goes DOWN to (4,1), still not immediately threatening (1,0) since they\u2019re far.  \n\n**Risk of future dead ends**:  \nMoving LEFT to (5,0): Next moves from there could be UP to (5,1) or LEFT to (4,0), possibly DOWN off board, so only UP/LEFT available. Need to check if that traps eventually.  \nMoving RIGHT to (7,0): From there, UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) (body still there but clearing next turn if we advance), possibly DOWN off board. But board's right side has fewer apples.\n\nLong-term: The apple at (6,6) is closer if I go up soon, but currently blocked by my own body at (6,1). My body will clear slowly.\n\nBetter plan: Head west toward (1,0) apple while avoiding Snake #1. Snake #1 is currently at (4,2), might go toward (2,9) or (1,1).  \n\n**(5,0)** is safer because enemy cannot collide head-on this turn and it progresses toward goal apples.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Now I need to choose my next move.\n\nLet's evaluate the four directions from my head (4,0):\n\n1. UP: to (4,1) - This is occupied by snake #1's body segment (from their body list: (4,1) is the first body segment of snake #1). So moving UP would hit snake #1's body and die. Invalid.\n\n2. DOWN: to (4,-1) - This is off the board (y-coordinate -1 is invalid). Invalid.\n\n3. LEFT: to (3,0) - Check:\n   - Is it off-board? No, (3,0) is within [0,9] for both x and y.\n   - Is it my own body? My body is at [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)] - no.\n   - Is it snake #1's body? Snake #1's body is at [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] - no.\n   - However, we must also consider enemy head movement. Snake #1's head is at (3,1). They can move:\n        UP: (3,2) - free?\n        DOWN: (3,0) - which is where I want to go LEFT to.\n        LEFT: (2,1) - free?\n        RIGHT: (4,1) - occupied by their own body.\n   So snake #1 might move DOWN to (3,0). If I move LEFT to (3,0) and snake #1 moves DOWN to (3,0), we have a head-on collision and both die.\n\n4. RIGHT: to (5,0) - This is my own body (the first segment behind my head). Moving backwards into your own body is fatal. Invalid.\n\nSo, only LEFT is potentially safe, but it risks a head-on collision with snake #1 if they move DOWN.\n\nBut we need to check if snake #1 has other safe moves. From (3,1), snake #1 can move:\n- UP to (3,2): free? Board shows no obvious obstacle at (3,2). It's not in their body list (which goes up to (4,4)), and not my body. Probably safe.\n- DOWN to (3,0): free? Except for the risk of me moving there.\n- LEFT to (2,1): free? No obstacle.\n- RIGHT to (4,1): occupied by their own body (first body segment), so invalid.\n\nSo snake #1 has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, if I move LEFT to (3,0), and snake #1 moves DOWN to (3,0), we both die. However, snake #1 has other options (UP and LEFT) which might be more appealing because:\n- There is an apple at (1,1) which is to the left and up from them. Moving LEFT to (2,1) or UP to (3,2) might be more attractive than DOWN to (3,0) which has no apple.\n- Also, snake #1 might avoid DOWN because it's close to the bottom edge and might limit options.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is risky but not certainly fatal. It is the only move I have that isn't immediately invalid (UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all invalid). So I must take LEFT and hope snake #1 doesn't choose DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: I need to get to the apples on the left: (1,0) and (1,1). But I must avoid snake #1 which is larger. I should try to maneuver around the bottom and left edges to collect apples while avoiding conflicts.\n\nGiven that I have no other choice, I must go LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Snake #1 body? Their body is not at (1,0). \n   - Apple? Yes, there is an apple at (1,0). So this move would collect an apple and grow.\n   - Also, snake #1's head is at (1,1). If they move DOWN to (1,0), we could have a head-on collision. But they have other options.\n4. RIGHT: to (3,0) - This is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). **Invalid (would die)**\n\nSo only LEFT is a valid move.\n\nNow, assess the risk of LEFT:\n- Snake #1 at (1,1) can move:\n   - LEFT: to (0,1) - free\n   - DOWN: to (1,0) - same as my target (head-on collision risk)\n   - RIGHT: to (2,1) - their own body, invalid\n   - UP: to (1,2) - free\n\nThey might choose DOWN to go for the apple at (1,0) since they are close. But they also have the apple at (3,3) and others. However, they are larger (apples:7) and might be aggressive.\n\nBut note: if they move DOWN to (1,0) and I move LEFT to (1,0), we both die (head-on collision). This is bad for me since I have fewer apples (4 vs 7). So I should avoid this.\n\nIs there a way to mitigate? I have no other moves. So I must move LEFT.\n\nHowever, I can consider their incentives: \n- They have an apple at (1,0) which is tempting.\n- But they also have a clear path to (0,1) via LEFT, which is safe and might lead to other apples (like (0,9)).\n- Moving DOWN to (1,0) risks collision with me, and they might not take that risk since they are winning and have more to lose? Actually, they have 7 apples vs my 4, so they might be more cautious.\n\nBut if they are greedy, they might go for the apple. However, they have many options.\n\nGiven that I have no choice (only LEFT is valid), I must take it and hope they don't choose DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (1,0), my head will be at (1,0) and I'll grow. Then I should move to (0,0) to avoid the center and then head up the left edge toward (0,9) apple. This avoids the larger snake in the center.\n\nSo I must move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",
