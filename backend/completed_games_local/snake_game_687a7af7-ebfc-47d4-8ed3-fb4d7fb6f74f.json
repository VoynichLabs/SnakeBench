Snake 1 is at (3, 3).\nApples are at: (3, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (1, 5), (7, 7).\n\nMy objective is to move towards an apple safely.\n\nCurrent position: (7, 2).\nSafe board boundaries: X in [0, 9], Y in [0, 9].\n\nPossible immediate moves and outcomes:\n\n1. **UP to (7, 3):**\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds.\n   - Collision risk? Snake 1 is at (3, 3). No direct collision risk with Snake 1's head or tail (since it's length 1).\n   - Apple? No apple at (7, 3).\n   - Distance to nearest apples:\n     - (8, 7): dist $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (7-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1+16} \\approx 4.12$\n     - (7, 7): dist 4\n     - (3, 4): dist $\\sqrt{(3-7)^2 + (4-3)^2} = \\sqrt{16+1} \\approx 4.12$\n     - (8, 0): dist $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (0-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1+9} \\approx 3.16$ (closer)\n     - (1, 5): dist $\\sqrt{(1-7)^2 + (5-3)^2} = \\sqrt{36+4} \\approx 6.32$\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 1):**\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds.\n   - Apple? No apple at (7, 1).\n   - Distance to nearest apples:\n     - (8, 0): dist $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} \\approx 1.41$ (closest)\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 2):**\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds.\n   - Apple? No apple at (6, 2).\n   - Distance to nearest apples:\n     - (8, 0): dist $\\sqrt{(8-6)^2 + (0-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4+4} \\approx 2.82$\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds.\n   - Apple? No apple at (8, 2).\n   - Distance to nearest apples:\n     - (8, 0): dist 2 (A bit further than DOWN, but closer than UP/LEFT to most apples on the right side).\n\nThe apple at (8, 0) is the nearest available apple.\n(7, 2) -> (8, 0) is a Manhattan distance of 3 (1 right, 2 down).\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 1) gets me one step closer to (8, 0) (only 1 step away using Euclidean, 2 steps using Manhattan). From (7, 1), I can move RIGHT to (8, 1) and then DOWN to (8, 0) to collect it.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 2), I'm 1 step away from (8, 0) in the Y dimension. From (8, 2), I move DOWN to (8, 1), then DOWN to (8, 0). (3 total moves including the first move).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 1), I'm 1 step away from (8, 0) in the X dimension and 1 in the Y dimension. From (7, 1), I move RIGHT to (8, 1), then DOWN to (8, 0). (3 total moves including the first move).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT seem equally good for reaching (8, 0) in 3 total moves.\n\nLet's look at Snake 1 at (3, 3). Snake 1 is likely aiming for (3, 4) (1 step away) or maybe (1, 5) or (8, 7).\nIf Snake 1 moves UP, it hits (3, 4) immediately.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves UP to (3, 4):\nTurn 0: Me (7, 2), S1 (3, 3). S1 moves UP.\nTurn 1: Me (7, 1) [if I choose DOWN], S1 (3, 4) [Eats apple]. S1 length 2.\n\nSince Snake 1 is likely to take the apple right next to it at (3, 4), I should focus on the apples I can reach. (8, 0) is my best bet.\n\nChoosing between DOWN and RIGHT:\n\nDOWN to (7, 1): Keeps me centered vertically between the two clusters of apples (bottom cluster (8, 0) and top cluster (8, 7), (7, 7)). It directly approaches (8, 0).\nFuture moves: RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nRIGHT to (8, 2): Puts me 1 step closer to the right boundary, which is good for accessing (8, 0) and the top right apples.\nFuture moves: DOWN.\n\nBoth are good. I'll choose DOWN to maximize the approach to (8, 0) and keep options open if Snake 1 moves aggressively towards the right side.\n\nPath 1 (DOWN):\nT0: (7, 2) -> DOWN -> (7, 1)\nT1: (7, 1) -> RIGHT/DOWN -> If DOWN -> (7, 0). Then (8, 0) next. If RIGHT -> (8, 1). Then (8, 0) next.\nIf I choose RIGHT at T1: (8, 1)\nT2: (8, 1) -> DOWN -> (8, 0) [EAT]\n\nPath 2 (RIGHT):\nT0: (7, 2) -> RIGHT -> (8, 2)\nT1: (8, 2) -> DOWN -> (8, 1)\nT2: (8, 1) -> DOWN -> (8, 0) [EAT]\n\nBoth involve 2 moves to reach (8, 1) and 1 final move to eat at (8, 0). Total 3 moves.\n\nI'll choose DOWN. It keeps me safer from any potential early congestion on the right edge, though collision risk is minimal right now.\n\nMy plan is to head towards the apple at (8, 0). (7, 1) is the next step.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTarget apple (8, 0). Move DOWN to (7, 1) then RIGHT to (8, 1) followed by DOWN to (8, 0) to eat it by Turn 2. Then proceed towards the cluster of apples at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n* Note: This move puts me 1 step away from the apple at (8, 0).\n\n### Strategic Analysis:\n\nI am aiming for the apple at (8, 0).\n\n* If I move **RIGHT to (8, 1)**: I will be 1 step away from (8, 0). Next turn I can move DOWN and eat it. This is the fastest route.\n* If I move **DOWN to (7, 0)**: I will be 1 step away from (8, 0). Next turn I can move RIGHT and eat it. This is also equally fast (2 total moves to eat).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN lead to eating the apple at (8, 0) on Turn 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the positions relative to Snake 1. Snake 1 is at (3, 4), body (3, 3). Snake 1 might pursue (1, 5), (4, 5), or one of the higher apples like (7, 7).\n\nDistances from S1 (3, 4):\n* (1, 5): dist $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} \\approx 2.24$ (Very close)\n* (4, 5): dist $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} \\approx 1.41$ (Closest remaining apple for S1)\n* (8, 7): dist 5.8\n* (7, 7): dist 5.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake 1 will move towards (4, 5) or (1, 5).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 4) (towards (4, 5)):\nT1: Me (7, 1) -> (8, 1) [if RIGHT] or (7, 0) [if DOWN]. S1 (3, 4) -> (4, 4), Tail (3, 4).\nIf S1 moves UP to (3, 5) (towards (1, 5) or (4, 5)):\nT1: Me (7, 1) -> (8, 1) or (7, 0). S1 (3, 5), Tail (3, 4).\n\nMy chosen movements (RIGHT or DOWN) are far from S1's likely path, so collision is not an issue this turn.\n\nSince both RIGHT and DOWN lead to collecting (8, 0) on Turn 2, I will choose RIGHT because it positions me closer to the right boundary, which facilitates moving towards the next cluster of apples (8, 7) and (7, 7) once (8, 0) is secured.\n\nPath:\nT1: (7, 1) -> RIGHT -> (8, 1)\nT2: (8, 1) -> DOWN -> (8, 0) [EAT] (Length 2)\nT3 onwards: Move towards (7, 7) or (8, 7).\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\nMove RIGHT to (8, 1) to set up for eating the apple at (8, 0) next turn (Turn 2, via DOWN). After eating (8, 0), evaluate the remaining apples and Snake 1's position, likely heading towards (7, 7) or (8, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

S1 is at (4, 4), looking for an apple.\nApples close to S1 (Manhattan distance):\n* (4, 5): 1\n* (1, 5): 4\n* (7, 7): 6\n\nGiven S1's current position and the presence of (4, 5) immediately above it, S1 is highly likely to move UP to (4, 5) and eat it this turn, becoming length 3.\n\n**Predicted S1 move:** UP to (4, 5) [EAT].\n* S1 new head: (4, 5).\n* S1 new body: (4, 4), (3, 4).\n\nMy move DOWN to (8, 0) is far from S1 and guarantees I secure my first apple.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 0) and eat the apple. My new length will be 2 (Head (8, 0), Tail (8, 1)).\n2. Next turn (Turn 3), I must decide between pursuing (7, 7) or (8, 7). Both are close.\n   - From (8, 0), the Manhattan distance to (8, 7) is 7 (straight UP).\n   - From (8, 0), the Manhattan distance to (7, 7) is $1+7=8$.\n   - The path UP towards (8, 7) seems more direct.\n\nTurn 3: Move UP towards the (8, 7) apple. (E.g., UP to (8, 1) or (8, 2)).\n\nThe move is clear: DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

(8, 7): Distance 7 (straight UP).\n2. (7, 7): Distance $1+7=8$ (LEFT, then UP).\n3. (6, 5): Distance $2+5=7$ (LEFT, then UP).\n\nThe easiest target seems to be (8, 7), which requires moving straight up the right edge of the board.\n\n**A. Move UP to (8, 1):**\n* **Advantage:** Moves closer to (8, 7) (Dist 6 now). Maintains a perfectly straight path for the future.\n* **Disadvantage:** None, strategically strong.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (7, 0):**\n* **Advantage:** Opens path towards the center or left side targets (like (1, 5) or (2, 6) later), and gets marginally closer to (7, 7) or (6, 5) if I decide to shift targets.\n* **Disadvantage:** Distance to (8, 7) increases to 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (9, 0):**\n* **Advantage:** Keeps me on the edge.\n* **Disadvantage:** Distance to (8, 7) increases to 1 + 7 = 8. Closes off movement options to the right.\n\nThe path UP towards (8, 7) is the most efficient and direct route to an uncontested apple.\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake 1 is at (4, 5), length 3.\nClosest apples to S1:\n1. (4, 5) - *Wait, (4, 5) is no longer an apple, as S1 ate it in the imputed history based on its current length 3 and head at (4, 5). Let's check the remaining list: (8, 7), (1, 5), (7, 7), (2, 6), (6, 5).*\n\nClosest apples for S1 (4, 5):\n1. (6, 5): Distance 2 (RIGHT).\n2. (2, 6): Distance 2 + 1 = 3 (LEFT, UP).\n3. (1, 5): Distance 3 (LEFT).\n\nS1 is highly likely to move towards (6, 5) or (2, 6).\n* If S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5), then RIGHT to (6, 5) (EAT) next turn.\n* If S1 moves LEFT to (3, 5), then LEFT to (2, 5), then UP to (2, 6) (EAT).\n\nGiven S1's current position (4, 5), moving RIGHT to (5, 5) targets the closest apple (6, 5) quickly, or moving UP to (4, 6) targets (2, 6).\n\nMy intended move UP to (8, 1) is very far from S1's immediate sphere of influence. There is no risk of collision.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nMoving UP to (8, 1) maximizes progress toward the apple at (8, 7) while maintaining safety and keeping options open.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. Move UP towards (8, 7).\n2. Next turn (T4): Move UP (8, 2).\n3. T5: Move UP (8, 3).\n...\n8. T10: Move UP (8, 7) and eat. Secure 2nd apple (total 3).\n\nUP",

The enemy snake is currently at the bottom right corner ((8,0)) and is moving horizontally from a vertical descent, far away from my position.\n\nI have two main clusters of apples to consider:\n1.  **Left Side:** Apples at (1, 5) and (2, 6). The closest apple (1, 5) is 3 moves away (Left x3).\n2.  **Right Side:** Apples at (6, 5), (7, 7), and (8, 7). The closest apple (6, 5) is only 2 moves away (Right x2).\n\n**Decision:**\nAlthough my previous rationale suggested turning Left, a recalculation of distances and strategic value favors moving **RIGHT**.\n-   **Speed:** It takes 2 moves to eat the apple at (6, 5) versus 3 moves for the apple at (1, 5).\n-   **Denial:** The right-side cluster is closer to the enemy snake's column (x=8). By moving Right, I can consume the apples at (6, 5), (7, 7), and (8, 7) before the enemy can reach them. The enemy is currently at y=0, while these apples are at y=5 and y=7, giving me a significant lead.\n-   **Safety:** Moving Right to (5, 5) moves me into open space. Moving Left to (3, 5) would place my head adjacent to my own tail at (3, 4), which creates a slightly tighter maneuvering space (though still safe).\n\nTherefore, I will deviate from the previous plan and head Right to maximize apple intake rate and control the side of the board closer to the opponent.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 5). Next turn, move RIGHT to (6, 5) to eat the apple. After that, navigate upwards towards the cluster at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

If S1 moves UP, it goes to (6, 6).\n\nThe path of S1, regardless of its choice between (7, 7) and (2, 6), keeps it far away from my snake in the column 8. There is no immediate collision risk.\n\n### 4.

The enemy is further away and I should arrive first.\n\n**Move Comparison**\n- **UP (to 6,6):** This move keeps the snake more central. The Manhattan distance to the next closest apple at (2,6) is 4 steps. It maintains flexible open space on all sides.\n- **RIGHT (to 7,5):** This move places the snake closer to the right wall. The distance to (2,6) increases to 6 steps. While it potentially blocks the enemy from moving left, it commits me to the edge and limits rotation options towards the left side of the board later.\n\n**Decision**\nI choose **UP**.

I have a significant positional advantage to claim the two clustered apples at (7,7) and (8,7). I can reach (7,7) in 2 moves and (8,7) in 3 moves. Snake #0 would require at least 5 moves to reach (7,7) and 4 moves to reach (8,7). By moving swiftly, I can secure both apples before the enemy arrives.\n\n**Move Comparison**\n*   **UP (to 6,7):** This positions my head at column 6. Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7,7) to eat the apple. This path keeps my vertical body segment at column 6. This is strategically superior because it keeps column 7 open and maintains a slightly more central position, which is beneficial for the subsequent plan to turn left towards the apple at (2,6). Staying at x=6 provides a better angle to loop back to the left side of the board later.\n*   **RIGHT (to 7,6):** This also allows reaching (7,7) next turn. However, it places my body further right (column 7), closer to the enemy's vertical path and the right wall. This could restrict my movement space slightly more than the UP option and puts me closer to potential interference from Snake #0.\n\n**Decision**\nI will move **UP**. This secures the safest and most flexible path to the apples on the right while maintaining distance from the enemy and preparing for a future rotation to the left side of the board.\n\n**Plan**\nMove UP to (6,7), then RIGHT to (7,7) (eat), then RIGHT to (8,7) (eat).

RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n* Boundary? Safe.\n* Self-collision? Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Strategic Evaluation\n\nMy primary target remains (8, 7).\n\n**A. Move UP to (8, 6):**\n* **Advantage:** Path efficiency. Directly heads towards (8, 7).\n* **Distance to (8, 7):** 1 move. Next turn I can eat it.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (7, 5):**\n* **Distance to (8, 7):** 1 (to (7, 6)) + 2 (to (7, 7)) + 1 (to (8, 7) or similar path) = 4 moves (Manhattan: 1 + 2 = 3, but requires non-optimal moves). This diverts me.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n* **Distance to (8, 7):** 1 (to (9, 6)) + 1 (to (9, 7)) + 1 (to (8, 7)) = 3 moves. This also diverts me slightly.\n\nMoving UP is the optimum move to secure the apple at (8, 7) safely and efficiently.\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Risk\n\nSnake 1 is at (7, 7), length 5. Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)]. S1 is now in the center-top portion of the map.\nApples nearby S1: (8, 7) (1 move away for me, 2 moves away for S1 if it goes RIGHT then DOWN/UP/etc, or 1 move away if it moves RIGHT to (8, 7) but that conflicts with the apple I am targeting). (2, 6) and (1, 5) are further west. (0, 9) is north-west.\n\nS1's likely moves from (7, 7):\n1. **RIGHT to (8, 7):** This is a direct apple grab. If S1 does this and I move **UP to (8, 6)**, we do not collide head-on, but S1 takes my target apple.\n2. **UP to (7, 8):** Safety/seeking (0, 9).\n3. **LEFT to (6, 7):** Moving into its immediate body segment. **FATAL**. (S1 cannot move LEFT).\n4. **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safety/seeking western or northern apples later.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7):\n*   S1 Head: (8, 7).\n*   My Head (if I move UP): (8, 6).\n*   Collision: **NO collision**. S1 eats the apple. I am one move behind.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (7, 8):\n*   S1 Head: (7, 8).\n*   My Head (if I move UP): (8, 6).\n*   Collision: **NO collision**. I eat the apple next turn.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (7, 6):\n*   S1 Head: (7, 6).\n*   My Head (if I move UP): (8, 6).\n*   Collision: **NO collision**. I position myself to eat the apple next turn.\n\nGiven S1's move history (eating (7, 7)), it is highly probable S1 will go for the next closest, most valuable apple, which is (8, 7).\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 6), and S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7):\n1. S1 eats (8, 7). Snek 0 is at (8, 6).\n2. I lose the apple, but the move UP is still safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 5):\n*   S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7). I lose the apple. I am now further away.\n*   My distance to (8, 7) increases to 3 moves.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5):\n*   S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7). I lose the apple. I am now further away.\n*   My distance to (8, 7) remains 3 moves.\n\nSince I am only 2 segments long and S1 is 5 segments long, I must prioritize getting apples regardless of S1's actions, as long as I remain safe. My plan was to eat (8, 7) on T9. If S1 is going to grab it on T8, I cannot stop it without initiating a head-on collision, which is impossible since we are not adjacent.\n\nHowever, let's look at the remaining apples if S1 takes (8, 7): (1, 5), (2, 6), (0, 9), (9, 3).\n*   My current location (8, 5).\n    *   To (9, 3): Manhattan distance 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   To (2, 6): Manhattan distance 6 + 1 = 7.\n*   If I move UP to (8, 6):\n    *   To (9, 3): 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (9, 5):\n    *   To (9, 3): 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN). This looks very attractive if (8, 7) is gone.\n\n**New Strategic Decision:** Assuming S1 takes (8, 7), I should pivot cleanly to the next best target, which is (9, 3). Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) sets me up perfectly for (9, 3).\n\nPath Comparison:\n1. **Move UP to (8, 6):** Best if (8, 7) is available. Next best target for me is (9, 3), requiring a move $\\rightarrow$ RIGHT to (9, 6), then $\\downarrow$ DOWN, $\\downarrow$ DOWN, $\\downarrow$ DOWN. Total 4 moves to (9, 3).\n2. **Move RIGHT to (9, 5):** Best path toward (9, 3). Next moves $\\downarrow$ DOWN, $\\downarrow$ DOWN. Total 3 moves to (9, 3).\n\nSince S1 already has 4 apples and is heavily favored to grab (8, 7) to reach 5 apples, I must assume a competitive move from S1. Pivoting immediately to (9, 3) is the most effective contingency plan.\n\n**Move Decision: RIGHT** to (9, 5). This keeps me safe and positions me to grab the (9, 3) apple in 2 subsequent moves, giving me my 2nd apple quickly.\n\nLong-Term Plan (Contingency for S1 taking (8, 7)):\nT8: RIGHT to (9, 5).\nT9: DOWN to (9, 4).\nT10: DOWN to (9, 3) and eat.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake (ID 0) is at coordinates (8, 5), which is 2 steps away from the apple at (8, 7) and 2 steps away from my current head position.\n\nBy moving **RIGHT**, I will secure the apple at (8, 7) this turn. Since the enemy is at (8, 5), the closest they can get to (8, 7) this turn is (8, 6). Thus, there is zero risk of collision on this specific move.\n\nSecuring this apple increases my apple count to 5 (vs Enemy's 1), further solidifying my lead. According to the win conditions regarding simultaneous death (\"the snake with more apples at that moment wins\"), maintaining a significant apple lead forces the opponent to play cautiously, as a head-on collision would result in my victory.\n\n**Move Comparison**\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 7):** **Best Move.** Immediately consumes the apple, score becomes 5. Safe from enemy collision this turn. Keeps options open to move UP or further RIGHT next turn.\n*   **UP (to 7, 8):** Safe, but allows the enemy to move to (8, 6), potentially contesting the apple next turn or making the area more dangerous. It yields the initiative unnecessarily.\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 6):** Moves away from the apple and closer to the enemy's potential path, constricting movement.\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 7):** Immediate death (collision with own body).\n\n**Decision**\nFollow the established plan: take the apple.\n\n**Plan**\nCapture the apple at (8, 7). Next turn, assuming the enemy moves UP to (8, 6) or stays in the lower right, I will likely move UP to (8, 8) to avoid getting pinned against the wall and to start rotating towards the top-left apple at (0, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is expected to move DOWN to grab the apple at (9, 3) or possibly LEFT, but in either case, they remain in the bottom-right quadrant for now.\n\nI have two potential safe moves: UP to (8, 9) or LEFT to (7, 8).\n*   **Move LEFT (to 7, 8):** This moves me towards the central/left apples faster but keeps me closer to the vertical center of the board where I might eventually encounter the enemy if they move towards the middle. It also requires navigating around my own body segments at y=7.\n*   **Move UP (to 8, 9):** This moves me to the top edge of the board. This path is extremely safe as it maximizes the distance from the enemy. It aligns perfectly with a route to the isolated apple at (0, 9). By taking the top route, I can secure the apple at (0, 9) without contest. From the top-left corner, I will then have a commanding position to drop down and collect the remaining apples on the left side ((2, 6), (1, 5)), likely arriving there before or at the same time as the enemy, but with a better angle of approach.\n\nGiven my significant lead (5 apples vs 1) and the game state (Turn 10/150), playing safely to guarantee points and survive is the winning strategy. Racing for the center apples risks a head-on collision or tactical error. Securing the perimeter is safer and robust.\n\n**Plan**\nMove UP to (8, 9). From there, proceed LEFT (West) along the top row (y=9) to collect the apple at (0, 9). This secures a point safely and positions me to dominate the left side of the board subsequently.\n\nUP",

(9, 3) is the immediate body segment. **FATAL**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Strategic Evaluation\n\nI am currently at (8, 3). The closest apple is (4, 5). MD = |8-4| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\n1. **LEFT to (7, 3):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 3 + 2 = 5. Keeps me on the Y=3 line, continuing west. Good progress, but potentially limits movement north/south later if I keep going west without turning.\n2. **UP to (8, 4):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 4 + 1 = 5. Moves towards the Y=5 apple line. Good orientation.\n3. **DOWN to (8, 2):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 4 + 3 = 7. Moves away from apples. Least desirable.\n\nComparing LEFT and UP: Both reduce the MD to the closest apple (4, 5) equally well (MD 6 -> 5).\n*   Moving UP to (8, 4) directly sets me up to potentially move UP again to (8, 5) or LEFT towards (7, 4) or (6, 4), and then turn up towards (4, 5). This seems like a good route.\n*   Moving LEFT to (7, 3) commits me further west, perhaps targeting (1, 4) or (1, 5) which are further away (MD 9 and 10, respectively, from current head), but they are less likely to be contested by Snake 1.\n\nGiven that I am close to the center column (X=4), maneuvering UP now gives me more options to reach (4, 5). If I move LEFT, I'll still need to turn UP eventually.\n\nLet's prioritize the direct route to (4, 5). Moving UP seems more decisive for that specific target.\n\n### 3.

MD = |8-4| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n1. **UP to (8, 5):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 4 + 0 = 4. Reduces distance by 1. Puts me on the Y=5 line.\n2. **LEFT to (7, 4):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 3 + 1 = 4. Reduces distance by 1. Continues west.\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 4):** MD to (4, 5) becomes 5 + 1 = 6. Moves away from apples. Least desirable.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are equally effective in reducing the Manhattan Distance to (4, 5).\n\n*   If I move **UP to (8, 5)**: I am on the Y=5 line. The next move could be LEFT (7, 5) or LEFT (6, 5), then to X=4. This seems like a smooth approach, giving me space to maneuver.\n*   If I move **LEFT to (7, 4)**: I am still on Y=4. I will need to move UP eventually to get to Y=5, or keep moving west toward (1, 4) or (1, 5).\n\nSince (4, 5) is the primary target and it sits on Y=5, moving UP to (8, 5) seems more direct for alignment.\n\nLet's check other nearby apples.\n*   (1, 5): MD currently 7. If UP: MD 7. If LEFT: MD 6. (LEFT is slightly better for (1, 5)).\n*   (2, 6): MD currently 6. If UP: MD 5. If LEFT: MD 7. (UP is significantly better for (2, 6)).\n\nGiven the proximity of (2, 6) and (4, 5), moving UP to (8, 5) provides better positioning for two of the closest apples.\n\n### 3.

UP to (6, 10): Boundary. **FATAL**.\n2. DOWN to (6, 8): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (5, 9): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (7, 9): Self-collision. **FATAL**.\n\nS1 likely moves DOWN to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 9). Both keep S1 far away from my snake at (8, 5) or (7, 4). No immediate collision risk.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan\n\nI will move UP to (8, 5).\n\nT14 goal: Continue west towards X=4. From (8, 5), I will likely move LEFT to (7, 5), then (6, 5), and depending on S1's position, cut down to (4, 5) or continue towards (2, 6).\n\nChoosing UP.\n\nUP",

This forces a path down the left edge of the board (column 0), which positions me excellently to approach the remaining apples at (1, 5) and (1, 4) from the outside wall, keeping my body compact and defensive.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move LEFT to (0, 9) to consume the apple.\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move DOWN to (0, 8) to exit the corner.\n3.  **Future:** Continue moving South along column 0 or 1 to contest the apples at (1, 5) and (1, 4).\n\nLEFT",

Next turn, I will be 1 move away from (2, 6). (3, 6) -> (2, 6) or (3, 7) -> (2, 7) or (3, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (2, 7). No, (3, 6) -> (2, 6) is the optimal path.\n   * Path: (3, 5) -> (3, 6) then T20 move to (2, 6) to eat.\n\n3. **Move DOWN to (3, 4):**\n   * Prepares for (1, 4). MD becomes 2.\n   * Moving down might be slightly less desirable as it restricts vertical movement to coordinate 3 if I continue left/right.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are excellent candidates, allowing an apple capture on Turn 20.\n\n*Strategy Comparison:*\n* If I go LEFT, I eat (1, 5) at T20. I will be at (1, 5). My body will now occupy (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5). Next, I can move UP towards (2, 6) or DOWN towards (1, 4).\n* If I go UP, I eat (2, 6) at T20. I will be at (2, 6). My body will occupy (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5). Next, I can move LEFT towards (1, 5) or DOWN towards (1, 4).\n\nThe apple at (1, 5) is slightly more \"contained\" by the wall. If I clear it, I maintain more central maneuverability for the remaining apples (2, 6), (1, 4), and (7, 4).\n\nLet's prioritize clearing the horizontal path first, moving LEFT.\n\n### 3.

RIGHT to (1, 9): Self-collision. **FATAL**.\n\nSnake 1 **MUST** move DOWN to (0, 8).\n\nS1 is completely out of range and poses no immediate threat. My move LEFT is safe.\n\n### 4.

The apple (1, 4) is at MD 3. This sequence is slightly less efficient for clearing nearby apples.\n\nTherefore, targeting (1, 5) first leads to a more efficient subsequent capture of (1, 4).\n\n### 3.

DOWN leads to an apple.\n\n### 2. Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nThe clear and optimal move is DOWN to eat the apple at (1, 4). This continues the efficient path identified in the previous turn's rationale.\n\n**Move DOWN to (1, 4):**\n* New Head: (1, 4). Length: 6.\n* Snake body will occupy: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5).\n\nAfter eating (1, 4), the closest apples are:\n1. (2, 6): MD = 3 (RIGHT, UP, UP)\n2. (1, 1): MD = 3 (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN)\n3. (7, 4): MD = 6\n\nThe apple at (2, 6) is the immediate next target as it is close and Snake #1 is not near it. (1, 1) is also accessible.\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Risk\n\nSnake 1 Head: (0, 7). Length 7.\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (0, 7):\n1. UP to (0, 8): Self-collision (body is (0, 8)). **FATAL**.\n2. DOWN to (0, 6): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (-1, 7): Boundary. **FATAL**.\n4. RIGHT to (1, 7): Safe.\n\nExpected S1 movements: DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (0, 6), they secure the corner and potentially move towards (1, 1).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (1, 7), they are moving generally towards the center.\n\nMy move DOWN takes me from (1, 5) to (1, 4). This move is completely safe regardless of S1's move, as S1 is far away. (1, 7) or (0, 6) poses no immediate threat to (1, 4).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nMove DOWN to safely consume the apple at (1, 4).\n\n---\n*Long-Term Plan (T22+):*\nT22: Head at (1, 4). Target (2, 6) (MD 3) or (1, 1) (MD 3).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 4): Closer to (2, 6).\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 3): Closer to (1, 1).\n\nSince (2, 6) is in the upper part of the board where Snake #1 is still active, securing that one seems prudent. (5, 9) is also slightly threatened by Snake #1. I should move towards the center/top to capture (2, 6).\n\nT22 Move: RIGHT (1, 4) -> (2, 4).\nT23 Move: UP (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\nT24 Move: UP to eat (2, 6).\n---\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Strategy & Analysis**\nMy head is at (0, 7). My previous plan was to move DOWN into column 0 to target the bottom-left apple at (1, 1). However, a deeper simulation reveals a significant risk: Snake #0 is at (1, 5) and is likely to move DOWN to consume the apple at (1, 4). From there, it has a shorter path to the (1, 1) apple than I do. If Snake #0 beats me to (1, 1), it effectively blocks the exit of column 0 at (0, 1), trapping me in a dead-end corridor.\n\nTherefore, I must abandon the column 0 plan. The best alternative is to target the apple at (2, 6) or shift towards the right side of the board where (5, 9) and (7, 4) are located. Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 7) is safer and more flexible than moving DOWN.\n- **Safety:** (1, 7) avoids the potential trap in column 0. It puts me in open space with escape options to the right (2, 7) or up (1, 8) if needed.\n- **Apple Access:** From (1, 7), I can still reach the apple at (2, 6) in 3 moves (Sequence: RIGHT -> DOWN -> RIGHT), which is the same speed as the DOWN path, provided Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 4) as expected.\n- **Contingency:** If Snake #0 unexpectedly moves UP to (1, 6), passing through (1, 7) allows me to peel off to (2, 7) and seek other apples, whereas being at (0, 6) would force me down the dangerous chute.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 7).\n2.  **Next Turn:** If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 4), move **DOWN** to (1, 6) to set up for the apple at (2, 6). If Snake #0 moves UP, move **RIGHT** to (2, 7) to avoid collision and seek other targets.\n3.  **Future:** Secure the apple at (2, 6) and then assess the path to (5, 9) or (7, 4).\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n* Self-collision? Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nI just collected an apple, making my snake length 6. Snake #1 is slightly ahead with 6 apples and is currently positioning itself high on the board (Head at 1, 7).\n\nApples distances (Manhattan Distance, MD) from (1, 4):\n1. (2, 6): MD = |2-1| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Target from previous plan)\n2. (1, 1): MD = |1-1| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3\n3. (7, 4): MD = |7-1| + |4-4| = 6 + 0 = 6\n4. (5, 9): MD = |5-1| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n5. (4, 1): MD = |4-1| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nThe closest apples are (2, 6) and (1, 1).\n\n**Option 1: Aiming for (2, 6) (UP/RIGHT direction)**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 4).\n* Rationale: Puts me in a good position to move UP towards (2, 6).\n* Next potential moves: UP to (2, 5), then UP to (2, 6) [Apple].\n\n**Option 2: Aiming for (1, 1) (DOWN direction)**\nMove DOWN to (1, 3).\n* Rationale: Straight path down for (1, 1).\n* Next potential moves: DOWN to (1, 2), then DOWN to (1, 1) [Apple].\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (0, 4)**\n* Rationale: Retreats towards the wall, seems less productive for capturing immediate apples.\n\nSince Snake #1 is currently at (1, 7) and extends up the left side, moving RIGHT and UP towards (2, 6) helps secure an apple that Snake #1 could potentially target if they move center/right. (1, 1) is relatively safe territory, as Snake #1 would have to move significantly down the board to contest that.\n\nMy plan continues to focus on securing (2, 6).\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Risk\n\nSnake 1 Head: (1, 7). Body [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]. Tail (3, 9).\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (1, 7):\n1. UP to (1, 8): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (1, 6): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (0, 7): (0, 7) is immediate body segment. **FATAL**.\n4. RIGHT to (2, 7): Safe.\n\nExpected S1 movements: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n* If S1 moves UP to (1, 8): Maintains current line, keeps distance from me.\n* If S1 moves DOWN to (1, 6): S1 is immediately next to the apple (2, 6). This is dangerous for my plan.\n* If S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 7): Moves closer to the center, slightly threatening (2, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 4), my head is at (2, 4).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (1, 6), they are 2 steps above me and 1 step from the apple (2, 6).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 7), they are 3 steps above me.\n\nIf S1 targets (2, 6) by moving DOWN (1, 7 -> 1, 6), then RIGHT (1, 6 -> 2, 6), they would capture it in 2 turns unless I am faster.\nMy path to (2, 6) from (1, 4) if I move RIGHT:\nT22: (1, 4) -> (2, 4) (RIGHT)\nT23: (2, 4) -> (2, 5) (UP)\nT24: (2, 5) -> (2, 6) (UP, EATING)\nTotal 2 moves, 3 turns.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN:\nT22: (1, 7) -> (1, 6) (DOWN)\nT23: (1, 6) -> (2, 6) (RIGHT, EATING)\nTotal 1 move, 2 turns.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN, they will beat me to (2, 6). I must adjust my target.\n\n### 4. Adjusting Target\n\nDue to high risk of losing (2, 6) to Snake #1, I should immediately shift focus to (1, 1), which is equally close (MD 3) and uncontested.\n\nPath to (1, 1):\nT22: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) (DOWN)\nT23: (1, 3) -> (1, 2) (DOWN)\nT24: (1, 2) -> (1, 1) (DOWN, EATING)\nTotal 2 moves, 3 turns.\n\nThis trajectory keeps me safe and secures an apple.\n\nConsidering the move DOWN to (1, 3):\nIt is safe from immediate collision. It clearly sets up the path for (1, 1).\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe predicted movement of Snake #1 (or even just the possibility of them moving DOWN) makes (2, 6) too high risk. Switching to the uncontested (1, 1) is the safer and more reliable option to maintain score parity.\n\n---\n*Long-Term Plan (T23+):*\nT23: Head at (1, 3). Move DOWN to (1, 2).\nT24: Head at (1, 2). Move DOWN to (1, 1) (Eating).\nT25: Head at (1, 1). Target the next closest apple ((7, 4) MD 7 or (4, 1) MD 3). Since (4, 1) is very close after eating (1, 1), that will be the next target.\n---\nDOWN",

LEFT leads into column 0, which is currently a dead end/cul-de-sac.\n-   **Position (2, 7):** This square is in a more open area (row 7). From here, I would have valid moves UP, DOWN (to the apple), and RIGHT. This offers significantly more tactical flexibility.

Move DOWN to (1, 2):**\n* This is a direct path to the apple (1, 1).\n* Next turn (T24): Move DOWN to (1, 1) to eat.\n* **Manhattan Distance to (1, 1): 1**\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (0, 3):**\n* Leads away from (1, 1). MD to (1, 1) becomes 4 (from (0, 3)). Not efficient.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n* Leads away from (1, 1). MD to (1, 1) becomes 3 (from (2, 3)). Not efficient.\n\nThe optimal move is clearly DOWN.\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Risk\n\nSnake 1 Head: (2, 7). Body [(1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]. Tail (2, 9).\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (2, 7):\n1. UP to (2, 8): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (2, 6): **Apple!** (2, 6) is an apple.\n3. LEFT to (1, 7): (1, 7) is immediate body segment. **FATAL**.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 7): Safe.\n\nExpected S1 movements:\n* S1 is highly likely to move DOWN to (2, 6) to eat the apple, as it's an immediate gain and high score pressure.\n* If S1 moves UP or RIGHT, it continues patrolling the top section of the board.\n\nSince I am moving DOWN towards (1, 1) in the bottom-left corner, and Snake #1 is confined to the top-center/left area, there is absolutely no risk of collision. The closest I will be to S1's current position is 4 steps (from (1, 2) to (2, 6) if S1 eats that apple).\n\nMy goal is clear and safe: move DOWN.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T24+)\n\nT24: Head at (1, 2). Move DOWN to (1, 1) (Eating apple, length 7).\nT25: Head at (1, 1). Target the next closest apple. Available apples: (7, 4) MD 7, (5, 9) MD 12, (4, 1) MD 3.\nThe next target will be (4, 1).\nT25: Move RIGHT to (2, 1).\nT26: Move RIGHT to (3, 1).\nT27: Move RIGHT to (4, 1) (Eating apple, length 8).\n\nThis plan keeps me focused on quick, uncontested apple accumulation.\n\nDOWN",

This wall physically separates me from the enemy's head, making a collision impossible on this turn. The enemy body segment at (2, 5) blocks my path further south but does not endanger the square (2, 6).\n2.  **Strategic Positioning**:\n    -   After taking the apple at (2, 6), I will be sandwiched between my body at (2, 7) (North) and the enemy body at (2, 5) (South).\n    -   However, the squares to the East (3, 6) and West (1, 6) are open.\n    -   Moving East (RIGHT) on the *following* turn towards (3, 6) is the superior option, as it leads to the large open area on the right side of the board where other apples (7, 4) and (5, 9) are located. Moving West leads into a narrow corridor.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Moving DOWN is safe, scores a point, and allows for a safe exit strategy to the open right side of the board.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn**: Move **DOWN** to (2, 6) to eat the apple.\n2.  **Next Turn**: Move **RIGHT** to (3, 6) to navigate away from the cramped left wall and enemy blockade.\n3.  **Future**: target the apples at (7, 4) and (5, 9).\n\nDOWN",

Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nThe clear goal from the previous turn was to secure the apple at (1, 1). Moving DOWN to (1, 1) achieves this immediately.\n\nThe board state shows Snake #1 is still far away:\nS1 Head: (2, 6).\nApples closer to S1: (7, 4), (5, 9), (8, 3).\nS1's move will likely be towards one of those or perhaps maneuvering away from the dense top-left where it just collected (2, 6) this turn (as predicted in the last rationale).\n\nSince (1, 1) provides an immediate score increase and size advantage (size 7), there is no reason not to take it.\n\nMove DOWN to (1, 1):\n* Gain 1 apple (total 6).\n* Grow to size 7.\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Risk\n\nSnake 1 Head: (2, 6). Body [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\n(A critical mistake in the last rationale's enemy prediction: the apple (2, 6) was eaten on T23 by Snake 1, which means S1 is now size 7, and its head *is* (2, 6), with the new segment at (2, 7). No, wait. S1's body listed is: $\\text{Head (2, 6), Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]}$. This implies S1 moved to (2, 6) *this turn*, T24, not last turn. Let's re-read the board state from T23's rationale:\nT23 S1 Head: (2, 7). Apples remaining: (2, 6), (7, 4), (1, 1), (5, 9), (4, 1).\nIf S1 moved DOWN from (2, 7) to (2, 6) on T23, it ate the apple (2, 6).\nNew T24 state: S1 Head: (2, 6). Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]. This body composition confirms S1 ate an apple. S1 is size 8 (7+1 segment growth). The provided body list has 7 segments, which plus the head makes 8 total segments. Apples collected is 7. This all aligns with S1 eating the (2, 6) apple on the previous turn.\n\nSince S1 is at (2, 6), its safe moves are:\n1. UP to (2, 7): Body segment. **FATAL**.\n2. DOWN to (2, 5): Safe. (Close to my old body segment (2, 5).)\n3. LEFT to (1, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe.\n\nS1 will likely move DOWN to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 6) to patrol for the next apple or avoid its dense body area.\n\nRegardless of S1's move, moving DOWN to (1, 1) is completely safe. The closest S1 will be to my head (1, 1) is if S1 moves to (2, 5), which is MD 5 away.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T25+)\n\nAfter eating (1, 1), my head will be at (1, 1). Length 7.\nNext closest apples: (4, 1) MD 3, (7, 4) MD 9, (8, 3) MD 9, (5, 9) MD 13.\nTarget: (4, 1).\n\nT25: Head at (1, 1). Move RIGHT to (2, 1).\nT26: Move RIGHT to (3, 1).\nT27: Move RIGHT to (4, 1) (Eating apple, length 8).\n\nThis plan maintains the strategy of quickly accumulating uncontested apples in the bottom half of the map while S1 dominates the top.\n\nDOWN",

My body is [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]. S1 moving to (3, 5) means S1 hits my tail. If S1 hits my tail *in its current location*, S1 dies. Since my tail is at (3, 5) and I just ate, my tail *remains* at (3, 5) this turn. S1 moving to (3, 5) is therefore dangerous for S1.)\n3.  LEFT to (2, 6): S1's body segment. **FATAL**. (Moving backward).\n4.  RIGHT to (4, 6): Safe.\n\nS1 is likely to move UP to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 6) to stay clear of the bottom half (where my snake is rapidly advancing) and potentially target apples (5, 9) or (7, 4). S1 just moved from (2, 6) to (3, 6), indicating a general movement to the right/up.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 6), my move RIGHT to (2, 1) is entirely safe from collision. The closest S1 would be is (3, 7) or (4, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves for ID 0:**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Advances toward the apple at (4, 1). This keeps me in an open area. Cost/Benefit: High benefit (clear path to next apple), no immediate risk.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 0):** Moves away from the apple, toward the bottom edge. This might be used if I needed to clear space or dodge an opponent, but neither is necessary now.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 1):** Moves away from the apple, toward the left edge. Again, poor positioning given the goal.\n\nThe best move is RIGHT, following the plan to secure (4, 1).\n\n### 3. Long-Term Plan (T26+)\n\nT26: Head at (2, 1).

Moving **DOWN** (3, 5) is technically valid (the opponent's tail will vacate that square), but it places me adjacent to the opponent's body segments at (2, 5), reducing safety margins.\n\nMoving **UP** (3, 7) is safe but places my head adjacent to my own body at (2, 7), leaving me with only 2 valid moves next turn (Up or Right), as Left is blocked by body and Down is backwards.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** (4, 6) moves into open space. It leaves 3 valid moves for the next turn (Up, Right, Down). It is equidistant to the primary target apple at (5, 9) compared to moving Up. Staying central at x=4 also prevents getting pinned against the top edge.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn**: Move **RIGHT** to (4, 6) to maximize freedom and distance from the opponent.\n2.  **Next Turn**: Likely move **UP** towards (5, 9).\n3.  **Long Term**: Collect (5, 9), then move down the right side to collect (7, 4) and (8, 3).

My specific goal is the apple at (5, 9) in the top center, and subsequently the apples on the right side of the board at (7, 4) and (8, 3).\n\nMoving **UP** to (4, 7) is a valid path to the apple, but it places my head adjacent to my existing body segments at x=2 and x=3, potentially creating a cramped situation on the left side. It also directs my body to form a barrier at x=4, which is closer to the current congestion.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 6) is the superior move for the following reasons:\n1.  **Open Space:** It moves my head into the widely open area (columns 5-9), maximizing freedom of movement.\n2.  **Alignment:** It aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple at (5, 9) immediately.\n3.  **Safety:** It increases the distance from the opponent (currently at y=1) and avoids the narrow corridor forming near (3, 7).\n4.  **Flexibility:** From (5, 6), I have 3 open neighbors for the next turn, allowing me to pivot if the situation changes, though the plan is to head UP.\n\nAfter collecting (5, 9), I will be at the top edge.

Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nMy last move collected an apple, growing my snake to length 8. I am currently low on the board (y=1). The remaining apples are: (7, 4), (5, 9), (8, 3), (0, 6), (3, 3).\n\nSnake #1 is centralized high (5, 7), likely targeting (5, 9) or moving towards (0, 6).\n\nMy goal is to move onto the main map, specifically heading towards the most accessible apple while avoiding S1.\n\n**Target Analysis:**\n1. **(3, 3):** Closest apple. Distance 3 via (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3) or (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2?), (3, 3). Seems like a good immediate target.\n2. **(7, 4) or (8, 3):** Moderate distance, slightly more risky as S1 might move right.\n3. **(0, 6):** Far end of the board, but currently unobstructed by S1.\n4. **(5, 9):** Very close to S1 (4 steps away). I am too far to contest it quickly.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 2):\n* I move toward (3, 3) and gain access to the middle of the board.\n* If S1 moves UP (to (5, 8)), it prepares to eat (5, 9).\n* If S1 moves LEFT (to (4, 7)), it starts moving towards (0, 6) or down the center.\n* If S1 moves RIGHT (to (6, 7)), it prepares for (7, 4) or (8, 3).\n\nMoving UP seems strategically sound to open up options and approach (3, 3).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 1):\n* This move is safer as it moves away from my long body segments on the left side (x=1).\n* It moves me closer to the right apples (7, 4) and (8, 3) if I travel up the x=5 column.\n* If S1 takes (5, 9), then I can pivot towards (7, 4) / (8, 3) or swing back left for (3, 3).\n\nLet's evaluate movements to (3, 3) (distance 3) vs (5, 9) (S1's target, distance ~10 for me) vs (7, 4) (distance ~7 for me).\n\nPath to (3, 3): (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3). (3 steps)\nPath to (7, 4): (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4). (6 steps if clear)\n\nSince (3, 3) is the closest apple and uncontested, I should prioritize it.\n\n**Choosing UP to (4, 2):**\nThis continues my ascent up the x=4 column, which puts me in a good position to either move LEFT to (3, 2) then (3, 3) or continue UP the center to intercept S1 or target (0, 6).\n\n### 3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nS1 Head: (5, 7). Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7)].\nS1 Safe Moves: UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6) **FATAL/Body**, LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7).\nWait, S1's body is [(5, 6), ...] so moving DOWN to (5, 6) is immediate self-snaking. S1 cannot move DOWN.\n\n* S1 Safe Moves: UP (5, 8), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7).\n\nIf S1 moves UP (5, 8): Closer to (5, 9). No threat to me at (4, 2).\nIf S1 moves LEFT (4, 7): Closer to (0, 6). No threat to me at (4, 2).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (6, 7): Closer to (7, 4). No threat to me at (4, 2).\n\nMy move UP to (4, 2) is entirely safe from S1, as S1 is currently far away (minimum distance 5).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nMove UP to (4, 2) to continue moving onto the central board and set up the acquisition of the apple at (3, 3).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT29: Move toward (3, 3). If S1 does not threaten the route, likely LEFT to (3, 2).\nT30: Move UP to (3, 3) to collect the apple.\nAfter T30, re-evaluate targets based on S1's position, likely focusing on (7, 4) or (0, 6). We must anticipate S1 targeting (5, 9).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nI successfully moved up to (4, 2) last turn. My primary current target is the closest apple at (3, 3).\n\nCurrent position: (4, 2). Target: (3, 3).\nPath to (3, 3):\n1. Move LEFT to (3, 2).\n2. Move UP to (3, 3) (collect apple). (2 steps)\n\nSnake #1 Head: (5, 8). S1 is heavily focused on the (5, 9) apple.\n\n**Predicting S1's move:**\nS1 head is at (5, 8). S1 body starts at (5, 7).\nSafe moves for S1: UP (5, 9) (Apple!), LEFT (4, 8), RIGHT (6, 8).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (5, 9), it collects the apple and grows. S1 will then need to figure out where to go next, likely towards (0, 6) or (7, 4).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8), it positions itself for other apples or attempts to block. Given the apple at (5, 9), UP is the most probable move for S1.\n\n**Evaluating My Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. LEFT to (3, 2):**\n* This is a direct approach to (3, 3).\n* Next turn, I can move UP to collect (3, 3).\n* Distance to (7, 4) from (3, 2) is 6 steps.\n* Distance to (0, 6) from (3, 2) is 4 steps.\n\n**B. UP to (4, 3):**\n* This keeps me central but slightly delays reaching (3, 3).\n* Next turn, I could go LEFT to (3, 3) (collect apple). (2 steps total, same as LEFT then UP).\n* This move might be useful if S1 moves LEFT to (4, 8), as moving UP gets me out of S1's potential path if S1 tries to cut down the centerline.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (5, 2):**\n* This moves me away from (3, 3) and closer to the right side where S1 might eventually head for (7, 4) or (8, 3). This is a less optimal move for the immediate goal.\n\n**Comparing LEFT and UP:**\nBoth LEFT and UP allow collection of (3, 3) in 2 turns.\n\n1. Sequence LEFT then UP: (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) [Eat]\n2. Sequence UP then LEFT: (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) [Eat]\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2), I am near my own body segments that extend down the x=1 column. However, the path is clear. It also positions me well for (0, 6) later.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 3), I am more central. This might keep me safer from S1 interactions, although S1 is high up. If S1 is going UP to (5, 9), there is no immediate interaction regardless of my move.\n\nLet's assume S1 collects (5, 9). S1 will be slightly longer now (L=9) and centered around (5, 9).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2):\nNext turn I eat (3, 3). My head is (3, 3), length 9. S1's head is likely (5, 9), length 9.\nI have immediate access to (0, 6) (3 steps away: (2, 4), (1, 5), (0, 6) or (3, 4), (2, 5), (1, 6)... need to check the board map).\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 3):\nNext turn I eat (3, 3). My head is (3, 3), length 9. S1's head is likely (5, 9), length 9.\nThis path brings my snake body slightly further left when collecting the apple, maximizing horizontal space for navigation post-apple.\n\nLet's look at the complexity of the board. My body is dense on the left (x=1 to x=4, y=1). By moving LEFT to (3, 2), I start moving along the boundary of my current body shape. This is fine, but slightly more restrictive than moving UP initially, where I gain vertical distance from my bulk.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 3):\nCurrent situation:\n 4 . T . . . . . A . .\n 3 . T . A . . . . A .\n 2 . T . . 0 . . . . .\n\nIf I choose UP: Head (4, 3).\nNext safe moves from (4, 3): DOWN (Self-snaking!), LEFT (3, 3 - Apple!), RIGHT (5, 3), UP (4, 4).\nThis ensures I can eat (3, 3) next turn via LEFT.\n\nIf I choose LEFT: Head (3, 2).\nCurrent situation:\n 4 . T . . . . . A . .\n 3 . T . A . . . . A .\n 2 . T . 0 . . . . . .\nNext safe moves from (3, 2): DOWN (3, 1 - Body!), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2 - Body!), UP (3, 3 - Apple!).\nThis also ensures I can eat (3, 3) next turn via UP.\n\nBoth moves prepare me perfectly for the next step. Since moving UP takes me further away from my dense body segments near y=1 and the turn is 29 (plenty of time), I prefer the UP move to gain vertical clearance and preserve flexibility in the centerline.\n\n### 3. Head-on Collision Check\n\nMy potential next positions: (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 2).\nS1 potential next positions: (5, 9) (Apple!), (4, 8), (6, 8).\n\nNo overlap or collision risk at all.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nMove UP to (4, 3) to approach the apple at (3, 3) while maintaining good board position and flexibility.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT30: Move LEFT to (3, 3) to collect the apple.\nT31+: Re-evaluate targets. S1 likely ate (5, 9). Priority is likely (0, 6), followed by (7, 4) or (8, 3). We will have length 9 and be positioned well to swing left towards (0, 6).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

Apples: 8.\n\n*Self-correction/Prediction Check:* My last move was UP to (4, 3). I predicted Snake 1 would move UP to (5, 9) and collect the apple there. Given the board state and S1's score now being 8 (one more than mine), this prediction was likely correct. S1 is now L=9, and its head is (5, 9).\n\nMy current goal is the closest apple at (3, 3).\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 0 at (4, 3))\n\nBoard state relevant to ID 0's immediate moves:\n* (4, 4) is empty (.).\n* (4, 2) is my body (T) - This is the immediate body segment behind the head.\n* (5, 3) is empty (.).\n* (3, 3) is an apple (A).\n\n**A. UP to (4, 4):**\n* Boundary? Safe.\n* Self-collision? Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe. S1 is at (5, 9).\n\n**B. DOWN to (4, 2):**\n* (4, 2) is the immediate body segment. **FATAL**. (Moving backward).\n\n**C. LEFT to (3, 3):**\n* Boundary? Safe.\n* Self-collision? Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n* **Apple!** (3, 3).\n\n**D. RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n* Boundary? Safe.\n* Self-collision? Safe.\n* Enemy collision? Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Immediate Goal & Strategic Evaluation\n\nThe target apple (3, 3) is exactly one move LEFT. This move is safe and guarantees I eat the apple, bringing my score up to 8, tying S1's score, and increasing my length to 9.\n\n**Move LEFT to (3, 3) [Eat Apple]:**\n* Head becomes (3, 3). Length 9. Score 8.\n* Critical information is secured: score tied, length tied.\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\nA. UP to (4, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 3): These moves delay eating the apple and allow S1 more turns to maneuver against me or grab another apple. Since the Apple is immediately available, it is strategically optimal to take it now.\n\n### 3. S1 Prediction and Collision Check\n\nS1 Head is at (5, 9). S1 has just grown to length 9.\nRemaining apples: (7, 4), (8, 3), (0, 6), (4, 8).\n\nS1 is at the top center. The nearest accessible apples for S1 are (4, 8) and (0, 6). (7, 4) and (8, 3) are also viable but a bit further/require more descent.\n\nPossible moves for S1 from (5, 9):\n1. DOWN to (5, 8) (Body segment - DANGEROUS, but not necessarily fatal if S1's tail moves out. Yes, (5, 8) is now S1's tail, since it just grew and moved UP from (5, 8) to (5, 9). **Wait, let's re-examine S1's body segments.**\n   S1 Head: (5, 9). Body: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7)].\n   The last segment is (1, 7). Since S1 just ate, its length is 9. (1, 7) remains. The segment behind (5, 9) is (5, 8). Moving DOWN to (5, 8) is collision with its own body segment. **FATAL.** S1 cannot move DOWN.\n\n2. LEFT to (4, 9): Steps towards (4, 8) apple or swing to (0, 6).\n3. RIGHT to (6, 9): Moves away from immediate apples.\n\nS1 is most likely to move LEFT to (4, 9) to grab (4, 8) next or position for (0, 6).\n\nMy intended move: LEFT to (3, 3).\nS1's likely move: LEFT to (4, 9).\n\nNo risk of head-on collision. S1 is 6-7 units away.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe move LEFT is safe, results in collecting an apple, and ties the score, which is critical since S1 currently leads.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT31: I will be at (3, 3) (L=9). S1 will likely be at (4, 9) (L=9) or (5, 8) (if the prediction about S1 moving DOWN was wrong, which I've corrected). Assuming S1 is at (4, 9), S1 is aiming for (4, 8) or (0, 6). I am in a good position to target (0, 6) (4 steps away) or (4, 8) (5 steps away, potentially blocked by S1). I should prioritize (0, 6) if the path is clear, as it is relatively safe entry into the bottom-left quadrant. We must also be mindful of the cluster of apples (7, 4) and (8, 3).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

The opponent (score 7) is well-positioned to take the apple at (3, 3) to reach score 8, but they cannot reach (4, 8) quickly because my body creates a blocking wall at row 6 (columns 2-5).\n\nThis wall protects my position in the top-left from immediate interference. It is safer to take the guaranteed point at (4, 8) to maintain the score lead than to race the enemy for the apples on the right side, which are slightly closer to the enemy's current position. After consuming the apple, I will have safe exits through the top-left area (e.g., towards column 0 or 1) to rejoin the rest of the board.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move **LEFT** to (4, 9).\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 8) to eat the apple.\n3.  **Future:** Navigate through (3, 8) -> (3, 7) -> (2, 7) or (3, 6) to exit the pocket, avoiding dead ends and maintaining options to target the next apple at (0, 6).\n\nLEFT",

(4, 8): Manhattan distance 6 (1 + 5). Straight path: R, UUUUU.\n3. (7, 4): Manhattan distance 5 (4 + 1).\n4. (8, 3): Manhattan distance 5 (5 + 0).\n5. (8, 0): Manhattan distance 8 (5 + 3).\n\nThe closest apples appear to be (7, 4) and (8, 3), and they are clustered together on the right side.\n\nHowever, S1 is at (4, 9) and is highly likely targeting (4, 8) right now, as it is only one move away (DOWN). If S1 moves DOWN to (4, 8), it grows to L=10 and takes the lead.\n\nThe next closest apple that is uncontested is (0, 6).\n\nLet's analyze directions from (3, 3):\n\n**A. UP to (3, 4):** Moves towards the center of the board, potentially positioning for (4, 8) or (0, 6). If S1 grabs (4, 8), I can move towards (0, 6).\n\n**B. DOWN to (3, 2):** Moves away from all immediate apples, potentially leading into the heavily populated body area (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1). This risks self-entrapment or a long path to (8, 0) eventually. Strategically poor unless fleeing a threat.\n\n**C. LEFT to (2, 3):** Moves directly towards (0, 6). Path: (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6). This is a solid, protected path.\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 3) sets a clear course for (0, 6).\nMoving UP to (3, 4) keeps options open but doesn't commit to a fast path. If S1 is going for (4, 8) (DOWN), and I move UP, I am still 4 steps away from (0, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 3):\nS1 moves DOWN to (4, 8) (L=10).\nI have a clear path to (0, 6).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 4):\nS1 moves DOWN to (4, 8) (L=10).\nNext turn (T32) I would move LEFT to (2, 4) to maintain distance from S1 and position for (0, 6).\n\nLet's model the path to (0, 6) vs (4, 8).\n\nPath to (0, 6) via LEFT:\nT31: (2, 3) (Left)\nT32: (1, 3) (Left) - My tail (1, 3) moves to (2, 7) or hangs. Since L=9, the tail (1, 3) moves to (1, 2), then (1, 1)... The space (1, 3) will be free.\nT33: (0, 3) (Left)\nT34: (0, 4) (Up)\nT35: (0, 5) (Up)\nT36: (0, 6) (Up) -> EAT!\n\nPath to (4, 8) via UP:\nT31: (3, 4) (Up)\nT32: (4, 4) (Right) or (3, 5) (Up). (4, 8) will be gone if S1 moved there. If S1 moves elsewhere, e.g., to (3, 9).\nIf S1 misses (4, 8):\nT31: (3, 4)\nT32: (4, 4) (Right)\nT33: (4, 5) (Up)\nT34: (4, 6) (Up) <- S1 body is here! (4, 6) is S1 body segment. Collision risk!\n\nThis confirms that attempting to go after (4, 8) is highly dangerous due to S1's presence (4, 9) and its body blocking the vertical approach (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, focusing on (0, 6) is the safer and more strategic option to secure the next apple.\n\nThe move LEFT (to 2, 3) is ideal for this purpose.\n\n### 3. S1 Prediction and Collision Check\n\nS1 is at (4, 9). S1 is L=9. The apple (4, 8) is next.\nS1 Safe Moves: DOWN to (4, 8) (Apple, L=10), LEFT to (3, 9), RIGHT to (5, 9) (Body segment (5, 9) is safe, it was S1's previous head position, but not the immediately preceding segment). Wait, S1's body segments are: [(5, 9), (5, 8), ...]. Moving RIGHT to (5, 9) is a collision!\n\nLet's check S1's body again: Head (4, 9). Body: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7).\nIllegal moves for S1: UP (Boundary), RIGHT to (5, 9) (Body segment), LEFT to (3, 9) (empty), DOWN to (4, 8) (Apple).\n\nS1 will certainly move DOWN to (4, 8) and eat the apple.\n\nMy move: LEFT to (2, 3).\nS1 move: DOWN to (4, 8).\n\nNo collision risk.\n\n### 4. Final Plan\n\nExecute the move LEFT to commit to the apple at (0, 6), securing a predictable path and avoiding immediate conflict with Snake 1, who is highly centralized in the top-middle/right.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT32: I will be at (2, 3), S1 at (4, 8) (L=10). S1 will likely pivot towards (7, 4), (8, 3) or swing back to (0, 6). I will continue LEFT towards (0, 6) via (1, 3), (0, 3) then UP. If S1 also targets (0, 6), I will try to beat it there or block its access. (7, 4) and (8, 3) remain as good secondary targets if (0, 6) proves too competitive or is eaten first.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

LEFT to (1, 3):** Tail position. Safe (The tail moves away: (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) ...).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Goal and Strategy Update\n\nSnake #1 is now at (4, 8) and has a clear immediate advantage in the center/right area, threatening (7, 4) and (8, 3).\nI am at (2, 3) and previously committed to (0, 6).\n\nDistance to Apples from (2, 3):\n1. (0, 6): MD 5 (2 + 3). Path: L, U, U, U (or L, L, U, U, U). Straightest path is via (1, 3).\n2. (3, 2): MD 2 (1 + 1). Very close.\n3. (7, 4): MD 6 (5 + 1).\n4. (8, 3): MD 6 (6 + 0).\n5. (8, 0): MD 9 (6 + 3).\n\nThe apple at (3, 2) is now the closest target. Eating it means I return to a tie in score and gain the lead in length (L=11).\n\nPath to (3, 2):\nUP to (2, 4) -> (3, 4) (R) -> (3, 3) (D - my body will be there, BAD).\nDOWN to (2, 2) -> (3, 2) (R) -> EAT! (2 moves)\nLEFT to (1, 3) -> (1, 2) (D) -> (2, 2) (R) -> (3, 2) (R) (4 moves)\n\nThe move DOWN to (2, 2) is the fastest way to an apple.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n\n**A. UP to (2, 4):** Moves towards (0, 6) but doesn't commit strongly. It's a delaying move.\n**B. DOWN to (2, 2):** Moves directly towards (3, 2). This is optimal for scoring quickly.\n**C. LEFT to (1, 3):** Continues the previous plan toward (0, 6). Path: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6). (4 moves).\n\nSince (3, 2) is only 2 moves away, and S1 is far away (MD 5 to (3, 2)), this is the best offensive option.\n\n### 3. Collision and Trapping Check\n\n**Move: DOWN to (2, 2)**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 2):\nNext turn I move RIGHT to (3, 2) and eat the apple.\n\nS1 is at (4, 8). S1 body segments are: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)].\nPossible moves for S1 (avoiding collision with its own body):\n1. UP to (4, 9) (Collision with immediate body segment (4, 9). Fatal.)\n2. DOWN to (4, 7). (Empty. Safest non-apple move towards the general center/right.)\n3. LEFT to (3, 8). (Empty. Moves towards (0, 6) or (7, 4) via top edge.)\n4. RIGHT to (5, 8). (Body segment (5, 8). Fatal.)\n\nS1 likely moves DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8). Neither move interferes with my path to (3, 2).\n\nThe board is open enough that moving DOWN to (2, 2) and then RIGHT to (3, 2) does not create any immediate self-trapping issues. My tail (1, 3) moves, freeing up space.\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nPursuing (3, 2) is the fastest way to score, tie the game, and increase my length, which is crucial for maneuvering later.\n\nT32: Move DOWN to (2, 2).\nT33: Move RIGHT to (3, 2) (EAT).\nS1 is too far away to contest.\n\nDOWN\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT33: I will eat the apple at (3, 2). Score tied 9-9. S1 will likely be moving towards (7, 4) or (8, 3) from (4, 7) or (3, 8). Since S1 is closer to the perimeter on the right, I should focus on the remaining left/center apples (0, 6) and then (7, 4)/(8, 3). After eating (3, 2), I will be at (3, 2), and look to move UP/RIGHT towards (7, 4) or (8, 3), or UP/LEFT towards (0, 6), depending on S1's position.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

I have successfully created a temporary wall along row 6 with my body, which currently separates the opponent (head at 2, 3) from the upper section of the board. However, this wall will begin to dissolve from the left side (tail retraction) over the next few turns, potentially allowing the opponent to move North.\n\nI have two valid moves: **DOWN** to (4, 7) or **LEFT** to (3, 8).\n- **DOWN (4, 7):** This square is a \"pocket\" surrounded by my body on three sides (East, South, North-after-move). Entering it would force my next move to be LEFT. This restricts my freedom significantly.\n- **LEFT (3, 8):** This moves me into an open area with three valid follow-up directions (Left, Up, Down). It maintains my high ground on row 8, keeping me safe from any sudden breakthroughs by the opponent through the dissolving wall at row 6.\n\nThere is an apple at (0, 6) which is the primary target for both snakes in this quadrant. The opponent is slightly closer but must navigate obstacles. There is also an apple at (3, 2) near the opponent, but it is situated inside a loop of their own body; taking it would likely trap them. Assuming a competent opponent avoids the trap, a race to (0, 6) is likely. Moving LEFT is the most efficient and flexible way to enter that race or intercept the opponent.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8) to maintain mobility and options.\n2.  **Short-term:** Continue moving West towards (2, 8) and (1, 8) to approach the apple at (0, 6). If the opponent reaches it first, I will control the top-left corner and can pivot East.\n3.  **Observation:** Watch if the opponent pushes North through columns 0-2 as my tail clears. Avoid colliding with them as they emerge from the lower section.\n\n**LEFT**",

This path is safe but adds an extra step to reach the lower section of the board compared to moving Left immediately.\n\n2.  **Objective (Apple at 0, 6):** \n    The apple at (0, 6) is the most strategic target.\n    *   **My speed:** Path (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 6) takes **5 moves**. I arrive on Turn 37.\n    *   **Opponent speed:** Snake 0 is at (2, 2). They are forced to move **LEFT** to (1, 2) this turn because (3, 2) is a deadly dead-end trap (surrounded by their own body) and other directions are blocked. From (1, 2), their fastest path to (0, 6) takes 5 additional moves. Total: **6 moves**. They would arrive on Turn 38.\n    \n    Since I arrive a full turn earlier, I will claim the apple. Even if we were to arrive simultaneously, I currently have more apples (9 vs 8), so a head-on collision or tie would result in my victory.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT is the most efficient and flexible move to secure the apple and maintain a winning position.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Current Turn:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 8).\n2.  **Next Turns:** Continue West to (1, 8) and (0, 8), then South to (0, 6) to eat the apple.\n3.  **Win Condition:** After eating, if the opponent is adjacent, I can leverage my score lead safely. The opponent is slower and cannot cut me off.\n\nLEFT",

Safety Check (ID 0 at (3, 2))\n\nI need to escape the tight cluster of my previous body segments.\n\nMy body segments (B1 to B9): (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1).\n\n**A. UP to (3, 3):** My body B3. **FATAL collision**. Moving UP is directly into the cell (3, 3).\n**B. DOWN to (3, 1):** My body B7. **FATAL collision**. Moving DOWN is into (3, 1).\n**C. RIGHT to (4, 2):** My body B5. **FATAL collision**. Moving RIGHT is into (4, 2).\n**D. LEFT to (2, 2):** My body B1. **FATAL collision** (Moving directly backwards).\n\nWait, I must re-examine my body segments after eating the apple.\n\nIf I were at (2, 2) and moved RIGHT to (3, 2) (eating), the body list shifts, and the old tail segment (1, 1) remains.\nNew H: (3, 2)\nNew B1 (2, 2). This was my old head position.\nNew B2 (2, 3).\nNew B3 (3, 3).\nNew B4 (4, 3).\nNew B5 (4, 2).\nNew B6 (4, 1). This is wrong based on old list: (4, 1) was B5 previously. Let's trace it carefully:\n\nOld Body (T33): H=(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1) [8 segments].\nT33 Move: Right to (3, 2). Grow.\nNew Body (T34): H=(3, 2).\nB1: (2, 2)\nB2: (2, 3)\nB3: (3, 3)\nB4: (4, 3)\nB5: (4, 2)\nB6: (4, 1)\nB7: (3, 1)\nB8: (2, 1)\nB9: (1, 1) (Tail)\n\nNow check possible moves from (3, 2):\n\n1. **UP to (3, 3):** My body B3. **FATAL**.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 1):** My body B7. **FATAL**.\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 2):** My body B5. **FATAL**.\n4. **LEFT to (2, 2):** My body B1. **FATAL** (Moving directly backwards).\n\nIt seems I have trapped myself completely by eating in a corner formed by my own body! This is a classic Snake mistake. I must have misjudged the collision check last turn, believing that eating the apple would shift the segments *just enough* to allow an escape.\n\nLet's re-read the environment update:\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (3, 2)\n  - Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)] -> This list is confirmed by the game state.\n\nLet's check adjacent cells for emptiness, assuming coordinates 0-9.\n\n* (3, 3) - Body B3. DEAD.\n* (3, 1) - Body B7. DEAD.\n* (4, 2) - Body B5. DEAD.\n* (2, 2) - Body B1 (immediately behind head). DEAD.\n\n**Conclusion: I am dead this turn.**\n\nHowever, since I am required to output a move, I must choose one direction. Since the outcome is certain death, the choice is arbitrary unless there is a chance of a head-on collision that could save me (if the other snake dies and I win by default).\n\n### 2. Situational Awareness / Collision Check (vs. Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 Head: (2, 8).\nSafe moves for S1 (assuming it uses its T33 body list: H:(3, 8), [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)].\n\n*If S1 moved LEFT to (2, 8) in T33*, then its new body segments are: H:(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6). Tail at (3, 6).\n\nPossible S1 moves from (2, 8):\n1. UP to (2, 9): Empty. Safe.\n2. DOWN to (2, 7): Empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT to (1, 8): Empty. Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 8): S1 Body B2. **FATAL** (Moves into (3, 8) which is B2, not B1, but still generally fatal unless (3, 8) is the tail, which it is not). Wait, B1 is (3, 8). Moving RIGHT into (3, 8) is a collision with B1. **FATAL**.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nS1 is far away (y=8, x=2). My head is (3, 2). S1 has no chance of hitting my head or body, and I have no chance of hitting S1's head or body, even if the move were safe for me.\n\nMy death is unavoidable due to self-collision.\n\nI choose a move arbitrarily, for example, RIGHT, as it moves towards the apple cluster on the right side of the board.\n\nFor consistency, I will choose RIGHT.\n\n### 3. Long Term Plan (N/A, I will die next turn)\n\nSince I cannot escape, I will choose a move and accept the outcome.\n\nRIGHT",

I do not need to take risks for apples, although moving towards them is a good heuristic in case the game continues.\n\n3.  **My Move Options**:\n    *   **UP (2, 9):** Moves to an edge. The apple at (3, 9) is adjacent, but (3, 9) is a \"hole\" surrounded by my body segments at (4, 9) and (3, 8). Entering (3, 9) would be a death trap. Being at (2, 9) is safe, but slightly restricted.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 7):** Moves into a safe square, but adjacent to (3, 7). The area east of (3, 7) (specifically (4, 7)) is a cul-de-sac formed by my body. Moving Down brings me closer to this clutter.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 8):** Moves into the most open region of the board (Columns 0 and 1). This path allows me to safely navigate towards the apple at (0, 6) along the left wall. It is the safest move with the most future flexibility.\n\n**Conclusion**: I will move LEFT to ensure survival while the enemy is eliminated.\n\n**Plan**\nSurvival is prioritized to trigger the win condition immediately.
