(7, 3) is an apple.\n   * **DOWN to (7, 1):** Safe.\n   * **LEFT to (6, 2):** Safe.\n   * **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Safe.\n\nSince both snakes are only 1 unit long, there are no body self-collisions to worry about, and no enemy body collisions. We only need to check boundary conditions and potential head-on collisions.\n\n2. **Check for head-on collisions:**\n   * Snake 0 is at (9, 4).\n   * If I move RIGHT to (8, 2), Snake 0 could move DOWN to (9, 3) or LEFT to (8, 4).

Snake 0 is slightly to the right of me, so moving right might slightly increase path overlap later, but we are too far for immediate concern.\n\nMoving UP to (7, 3) allows me to eat an apple immediately on Turn 1. This is the optimal starting move.\n\nMy plan is to move towards the nearest apples and try to grow quickly. (7, 3) is an apple, so UP is the move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** After eating at (7, 3), I will be at length 2. The next closest apples are (7, 7) or maybe (8, 6). I should continue going generally North or Northeast to clear out that quadrant of apples if Snake 0 doesn't interfere. Snake 0 is currently at (9, 4) and is likely to move down or left towards the center/bottom, or up towards (9, 7).\n\nUP",

Takes me toward apples at (8, 6) and (7, 3).\n- RIGHT to (10, 4): DEADLY - outside the board.\n\nAll three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) can reach an apple in about 3 moves. However, LEFT gives me the best strategic advantages:\n1. It moves me toward the center of the board, giving me more future movement options (4 directions from (8,4) vs only 3 from edge positions)\n2. It keeps me well-positioned to chase multiple apples in the upper-middle region\n3. It maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake\n\nThe enemy will likely move UP to (7, 3) to grab that nearby apple, but I'll be moving in a different direction toward the cluster of apples in the upper-right quadrant.\n\nStrategy note: Focus on controlling the center-right region where there are several clustered apples (6,6), (8,6), (9,7), (7,7), while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.

I just ate an apple at (7, 3) on the previous turn/setup move.\nEnemy Snake 0 is still length 1, at (8, 4).\n\nBoard size is 10x10, coordinates (0-9).\n\n**Game State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n\n*   **My position (Head):** (7, 3)\n*   **My Body:** (7, 2)\n*   **Enemy 0 (Head):** (8, 4)\n*   **Apples:** (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 5), (4, 9), (0, 1), (9, 7), (0, 3), (2, 5), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 7), (8, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (1, 6)\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 4):** Safe. (Boundary check: Y=4 is OK. No snake body/head there.)\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):** **Deadly.** This is my own body segment (the cell I just vacated). Moving directly backward is forbidden.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):** Safe. (Boundary check: X=6 is OK. No snake body/head there.)\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe. (Boundary check: X=8 is OK. No snake body/head there.)\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves based on Apple Proximity:**\n\nI am at (7, 3).\n\n*   **Apples Near Me (Euclidean distance approximation):**\n    *   (7, 7): Distance 4 (straight up)\n    *   (8, 6): Distance approx 3.2 (1 right, 3 up)\n    *   (6, 6): Distance approx 3.2 (1 left, 3 up)\n    *   (8, 3): No apple.\n    *   (6, 3): No apple.\n\n*   **UP to (7, 4):** Moves me 1 step closer to (7, 7). This is a good direction for future apples. No apple at (7, 4).\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):** Moves me 1 step closer to (6, 6) and (5, 8). No immediate apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** No apple. This move also brings me closer to the enemy Snake 0 at (8, 4).\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Head-on Collisions with Snake 0 (Head at (8, 4)):**\n\nSnake 0's safe moves are UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4), RIGHT (9, 4).\n\n*   If I move UP to (7, 4), and Snake 0 moves LEFT to (7, 4): **Head-on Collision! Both die.**\n\nThis is a critical risk. If Snake 0 moves LEFT, and I move UP, we collide at (7, 4).\n\n**4. Re-evaluating based on Collision Risk and Apple Goals:**\n\nI must assume Snake 0 is optimizing for apples too. Snake 0 at (8, 4) is close to:\n*   (9, 7) - 3 UP, 1 RIGHT\n*   (8, 6) - 2 UP, 0 LEFT/RIGHT\n*   (7, 7) - (1 LEFT, 3 UP)\n\nSnake 0 moving UP to (8, 5) or RIGHT to (9, 4) seems safe from me. Snake 0 moving DOWN to (8, 3) is safe from me.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (7, 4), it's aiming for the central apples or perhaps defending its territory. Since (7, 4) is one of the closest and most viable moves for Snake 0 to expand influence, I should avoid moving there (UP).\n\n*   **Avoid UP (7, 4).**\n\nRemaining safe moves: LEFT (6, 3), RIGHT (8, 3).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   No collision risk with Snake 0 at (8, 4) (closest possible move for S0 is (7, 4) or (8, 3)).\n    *   Sets me up to move towards (6, 6) or (5, 8).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (8, 3): **Head-on Collision! Both die.**\n\nSince (8, 3) is the single closest point for Snake 0 (1 move away) and is also my RIGHT move, this is high risk. Snake 0 might move DOWN to claim central/southern control.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT carry significant, immediate head-on collision risks:\n*   UP: Collision at (7, 4) if Snake 0 moves LEFT.\n*   RIGHT: Collision at (8, 3) if Snake 0 moves DOWN.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 3) is the only option that avoids an immediate 1-turn head-on collision with Snake 0, whose head is at (8, 4). Snake 0 cannot reach (6, 3) in one move.\n\nWhile LEFT does not secure an apple immediately, survival is the priority, especially in the opening moves where the board is wide open. Moving LEFT sets me up nicely to approach apples (6, 6) and (3, 5) or (4, 5).\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 3). Next, I should consolidate apples in the Northwest/Center quadrant (e.g., (6, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)). I need to monitor Snake 0's movements closely. If Snake 0 moves away (e.g., to (9, 4) or (8, 5)), I will continue North/West. If it moves South (e.g., (8, 3) or (7, 4)), I must consider how to block its access to central apples.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy at (7, 3) cannot move DOWN (into their own tail), so they can go UP to (7, 4), LEFT to (6, 3), or RIGHT to (8, 3). Moving LEFT to (7, 4) creates a small risk of head-on collision if the enemy moves UP.\n\nLooking at apples, the closest to me is at (8, 6), just 2 moves away. UP to (8, 5) puts me one step closer and positions me to grab that apple next turn.\n\nMoving UP is the best choice because:\n1. It's completely safe - no risk of collision with the enemy\n2.

(Moving onto a body segment is death, regardless if it's the tail).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (8, 5)):**\n\n*   Snake 0 is length 1. No body segments to worry about.\n*   Moves: (8, 6) [UP], (8, 4) [DOWN], (7, 5) [LEFT], (9, 5) [RIGHT].\n*   (8, 6) is an apple.\n*   (7, 5) is close to several center-left apples.\n\n**3.

Snake 0 cannot reach (6, 4) in one turn. Safe move regarding collision.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (6, 2):**\n*   **Apple:** No apple at (6, 2).\n*   **Proximity:** Moves away from most nearby apples located high up. Leads towards (8, 0) eventually, but that's far.\n*   **Collision Risk:** Safe.\n\n**C. Move LEFT to (5, 3):**\n*   **Apple:** No apple at (5, 3).\n*   **Proximity:** Good path towards (4, 5) (2 LEFT, 2 UP). Sets up for central apples.\n*   **Collision Risk:** Safe.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision & Collision Avoidance:**\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 5) and has an immediate apple available at (8, 6) [UP]. It is highly likely Snake 0 moves UP to (8, 6).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (8, 6), its potential expansion moves would be towards (7, 6), (9, 6), or (8, 7).\n\nI need to focus on securing apples on my side of the board and expanding length. (6, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), and (2, 5) are my immediate targets.\n\n*   Moving UP to (6, 4) directly sets me up for the apple at (6, 6) in two more moves.\n*   Moving LEFT to (5, 3) sets me up for the apple at (4, 5).\n\nSince I am aiming for the quickest apple, (6, 6) is only 3 steps away via UP -> UP -> UP.\n\nCompare:\n*   Path to (6, 6): (6, 3) -> (6, 4) [U] -> (6, 5) [U] -> (6, 6) [U, EAT]. Total 3 moves.\n*   Path to (4, 5): (6, 3) -> (5, 3) [L] -> (4, 3) [L] -> (4, 4) [U] -> (4, 5) [U, EAT]. Total 4 moves (or L->U->U->L which is 4 too).\n\nMoving UP seems locally optimal for immediate gain. It pushes me into the North-Center territory, which is currently less contested than the East (where Snake 0 is).\n\nI choose UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP to secure the apple at (6, 6). After eating (6, 6), re-evaluate based on Snake 0's position. My next targets will likely be (5, 8) or the cluster of apples (3, 5), (4, 5). Maintain control of the center-left side of the board.\n\nUP",

Move LEFT to (5, 4):**\n*   **Apple Potential:** Moves towards the (4, 5) and (3, 5) cluster. From (5, 4), (4, 5) is 1 LEFT, 1 UP.\n*   **Collision Risk:** Low, moves away from S0.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n*   **Apple Potential:** Moves away from immediate visible apples, except potentially (7, 7) (3 steps away via U, U, R).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Moves towards S0's territory. If S0 moves LEFT to (7, 6) and continues LEFT/DOWN, we might meet later.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n\nThe apple at (6, 6) is only 2 steps away from my starting position (6, 4). Moving UP to (6, 5) makes it 1 step away for Turn 4. Securing (6, 6) is crucial for widening the apple gap and increasing my length.\n\nLet's consider S0's likely moves and what they mean for (6, 6):\nS0 head is at (8, 6).\n1. S0 moves UP to (8, 7): Clears the way for me. S0 is now near (9, 7) and (7, 7).\n2. S0 moves RIGHT to (9, 6): Clears the way for me.\n3. S0 moves LEFT to (7, 6): This is the only move that puts S0 in competition for (6, 6). From (7, 6), S0 needs 1 LEFT to reach (6, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (6, 5) (Targeting 6, 6 on T4) AND S0 moves LEFT to (7, 6) (Targeting 6, 6 on T4):\nIf both try to land on (6, 6) on the next turn (T4):\nS1: (6, 5) -> UP -> (6, 6)\nS0: (7, 6) -> LEFT -> (6, 6)\n**This results in a head-on collision and both snakes die.**\n\nI must anticipate the collision risk. (6, 6) is only 2 steps from me, but also potentially 2 steps from S0 if S0 moves (7, 6) [L] or (8, 7) [U]. Wait, from (8, 6), S0 needs:\n*   To (6, 6): 2 LEFT (if S0 goes (7, 6) then (6, 6)) OR 1 UP, 2 LEFT (if S0 goes (8, 7) then (7, 7) then (6, 7)). The shortest path is 2 steps (L, L).\n\nSince S0 just got length 2 and is at (8, 6), the move LEFT to (7, 6) followed by LEFT to (6, 6) is a very tempting path for S0. Since I am only 1 turn shy of the apple itself after moving UP, the risk of a simultaneous hit is too high, especially when S0 is already trending West towards the center.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Avoid the highly contested (6, 6) and go for the center-left cluster.**\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) leads to:\n*   (4, 5) [2 steps: L, U]\n*   (3, 5) [3 steps: L, L, U]\n\nThis moves me away from S0 who is entrenched on the right side (8, X). Also, (4, 5) is relatively close.\n\nPath L: (6, 4) -> (5, 4) [L]\nNext turn (T4), I have options UP to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 4), or DOWN (4, 3) or RIGHT (6, 4).\nIf I choose UP: (5, 5). Apple (4, 5) is 1 LEFT.\nIf I choose LEFT: (4, 4). Apple (4, 5) is 1 UP. (Optimal path)\n\nTotal Path to (4, 5): (6, 4) -> (5, 4) [L] -> (4, 4) [L] -> (4, 5) [U, EAT]. Total 3 moves.\nThis is the same number of moves as the risky path to (6, 6).\n\nBy choosing LEFT, I increase my safety margin, occupy the center-left board, and target an apple with no foreseeable immediate competition from S0.\n\n(6, 6) is too risky due to the 2-step approach from S0 at (8, 6) via (7, 6).\nI will move LEFT towards (4, 5).\n\n**Revised Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 4) this turn. Next, move LEFT to (4, 4), then UP to eat the apple at (4, 5). After that, secure (3, 5) or look toward the high apples like (5, 8). This strategy prioritizes safety and uncontested apples.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) against Apple Proximity and Collisions:**\n\nMy Head: (5, 4).\n\nLast move rationale indicated a plan: L -> L -> U to grab (4, 5). I am currently at the first step of this plan (5, 4).\n\n*   **Apples near (5, 4):**\n    *   (4, 5) - 1 LEFT, 1 UP (Distance 1.41)\n    *   (3, 5) - 2 LEFT, 1 UP (Distance 2.23)\n    *   (6, 6) - 1 RIGHT, 2 UP (Distance 2.23)\n    *   (5, 8) - 4 UP\n    *   (4, 1) - 1 LEFT, 3 DOWN\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 (Head at (8, 7)):**\nS0 is closest to (9, 7) (1 RIGHT) and (7, 7) (1 LEFT). The apple (6, 6) is now 2 LEFT, 1 DOWN away from S0. It is likely S0 will move RIGHT to (9, 7) to secure that isolated apple, or LEFT to (7, 7).\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (4, 4):**\n*   **Apple Potential:** Continues the planned path to (4, 5). From (4, 4), (4, 5) is 1 UP. We can eat it next turn (T5). This is a 2-step path to the apple (L, U).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Extremely low. Moves away from S0.\n*   **Future Options:** Excellent. (4, 4) is central.\n\n**B. Move UP to (5, 5):**\n*   **Apple Potential:** This is 1 step closer to (4, 5) (1 LEFT) and also closer to the high apples (5, 8).\n    *   Path to (4, 5): (5, 4) -> (5, 5) [U] -> (4, 5) [L, EAT]. Total 2 steps. (Same speed as LEFT option).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Low.\n*   **Future Options:** Good.\n\n**C. Move DOWN to (5, 3):**\n*   **Apple Potential:** Moves towards (4, 1) (1 LEFT, 2 DOWN) and (0, 3) (5 LEFT). This feels counter-intuitive given the cluster of apples above (4, 5), (3, 5), (5, 8).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Low.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision (Comparing LEFT vs. UP):**\n\nBoth LEFT to (4, 4) and UP to (5, 5) get me to apple (4, 5) in 2 turns.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 4): Next turn, options are U/D/L/R. U leads to apple (4, 5). D is (4, 3), L is (3, 4). This position (4, 4) is highly flexible.\n*   If I move UP to (5, 5): Next turn, options are U/D/L/R. L leads to apple (4, 5). U is (5, 6). If I miss the apple, I am in a good position to go for (6, 6) (1 RIGHT, 1 UP) or (5, 8) (3 UP).\n\nThe move LEFT (to 4, 4) puts me closer to the left wall cluster (3, 5), (2, 5), (0, 5) faster.\nThe move UP (to 5, 5) maintains central horizontal position but commits to the upper half of the board, which is currently less contested.\n\nSince the goal set last turn was to secure the (4, 5) apple by moving L, L, U:\nCurrent position: (5, 4).\nNext move in the plan: L to (4, 4).\n\nThis path keeps the head (X) coordinate decreasing, heading towards the left wall. If I choose UP, I maintain X=5, and then on the next turn, I must turn LEFT to grab the apple, potentially making the turn radius less efficient for the subsequent apple (3, 5), which is 1 LEFT from (4, 5).\n\nPath L: (5, 4) --L--> (4, 4) --U--> (4, 5). Then, (4, 5) --L--> (3, 5) --EAT.\nPath U: (5, 4) --U--> (5, 5) --L--> (4, 5). Then, (4, 5) --L--> (3, 5) --EAT.\n\nBoth are 2 moves to (4, 5), and both are 2 moves from (4, 5) to (3, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize the original plan for consistency and safety, which targeted the (4, X) column.\n\nMove LEFT to (4, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT5: Move UP to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\nT6: Move LEFT to (3, 5) to eat the apple. (If apple (3, 5) is still available).\n\nLEFT",

Since S1 moved from (5, 4) to (4, 4) in the last move, the apple S1 previously ate was *not* at (5, 4) or (4, 4). S1 ate an apple previously, likely around T2/T3. The board state shows 15 apples remaining in the list provided, which is inconsistent with 3 apples having been eaten. I must trust the provided apple list and the displayed board IF they agree, and prioritize the calculated score/length if they conflict.\n\n    *   **Trusting the current turn's Apple list and Board:** The board shows 15 'A' spots, matching the list. This means the board state provided is accurate for *remaining* apples. If S0 scored 2 and S1 scored 1, 3 apples were consumed, and the list/board should only show 17 - 3 = 14 apples remaining.\n    *   I will assume the provided Apple list and the Board state visualization accurately represent the current location of edible apples, despite the score discrepancy implied by the total original apples (which is not explicitly provided, only inferred to be 17 if 15 remain and 2 were eaten). I will proceed with the 15 apples listed above. (Note: The apple at (7, 7) is definitely gone, as S0's head is there and it has length 3 and score 2; however, (7, 7) is not in the provided Apple list this turn, confirming it is indeed gone.)\n\n    *   **Apples near S1 (4, 4):**\n        *   (4, 5): 1 UP. **Primary Target.**\n        *   (3, 5): 1 LEFT, 1 UP.\n        *   (4, 1): 3 DOWN.\n        *   (5, 8): 4 UP, 1 RIGHT.\n        *   (4, 8): 4 UP.\n\n**1.

Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) against Apple Proximity and Collisions:**\n\nMy immediate goal, established previously, was to move LEFT to (4, 4) [done last turn] and then UP to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\n\n**A. Move UP to (4, 5):**\n*   **Result:** EAT Apple (4, 5). S1 length increases to 3. Score 2.\n*   **Immediate Gain:** Maximized.\n*   **Future Position:** (4, 5). Excellent position to move LEFT to (3, 5) next turn (if available), or continue UP towards (4, 8) and (4, 9).\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (3, 4):**\n*   **Result:** No apple. Moves further towards left wall.\n*   **Future Position:** Further from the direct target (4, 5). (4, 5) becomes 1 UP, 1 RIGHT. Delays apple by 2 turns instead of 1.\n\n**C. Move DOWN to (4, 3):**\n*   **Result:** No apple. Moves away from the apple cluster above.\n*   **Future Position:** Closer to (4, 1). This is a suboptimal move currently.\n\n**3. Decision:**\n\nThe move UP to (4, 5) secures an immediate apple and follows the established, successful short-term plan. This is the optimal move.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake #0 Projection:**\nS0 is at (7, 7). S0 ate an apple there last turn.\nNearest apples to S0:\n1. (9, 7): 2 RIGHT.\n2. (6, 6): 1 LEFT, 1 DOWN.\n3. (6, 8): 1 LEFT, 1 UP.\n4. (5, 8): 2 LEFT, 1 UP.\n\nS0 is likely to move to the side that offers the best immediate future. Moving RIGHT towards (9, 7) is a strong candidate, as it is an isolated apple that S0 can secure easily in 2 turns (R, R or U, R, D - depending on pathing). If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 7) or (7, 7) (which is a body segment unless tail moves), or DOWN/UP towards the cluster.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 7): S0 hits its body segment (8, 7) and dies, as (8, 7) is the first body segment (tail is (8, 6)). Wait, (8, 7) is not the tail, it's the second segment. Moving into any body segment but the tail is deadly. The segments are H(7, 7), B1(8, 7), B2(8, 6). If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 7), it dies. Therefore, S0 must avoid RIGHT.\n\nSafe moves for S0 (7, 7): H(7, 7), B[(8, 7), (8, 6)].\n*   UP (7, 8): Safe.\n*   DOWN (7, 6): Safe.\n*   LEFT (6, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 7): Deadly (hits its own body).\n\nS0 will likely target (6, 8) (U, L) or (6, 6) (D, L). A move LEFT to (6, 7) or UP to (7, 8) are plausible. S0's movement does not currently interfere with S1's move UP to (4, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT6: If (3, 5) still exists, move LEFT to (3, 5) to eat it.\nT7: (4, 5) is now (4, 6) (assuming no growth). Move towards the upper left apples (0, 5) or (2, 5).\n\nUP",

Since S0's length remained 3, they did *not* eat an apple. Their old tail (8, 6) must have moved to (8, 7) (if it was a body segment) or contracted. Looking at the enemy's previous body (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), if they moved to (7, 8) without eating: The new body is H(7, 8), B1(7, 7), B2(8, 7). The old tail (8, 6) disappeared. This confirms the new body is [(7, 7), (8, 7)]. Wait, the provided state says Enemy Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7)]. The body length *is* 3, meaning the tail (8, 7) is the one that disappears if they don't eat. Let's trust the provided state.\n*   **Apples remaining (14 total):** (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 5), (4, 9), (0, 1), (9, 7), (0, 3), (2, 5), (5, 8), (6, 8), (3, 5), (1, 6), (4, 1), (4, 8), (3, 2).

(3, 5): 1 LEFT. **Primary Target.**\n    2.  (2, 5): 2 LEFT.\n    3.  (4, 8): 3 UP.\n    4.  (4, 9): 4 UP.\n    5.  (5, 8): 3 UP, 1 RIGHT.\n    6.  (6, 6): 1 UP, 2 RIGHT.\n\n**A.

Next targets are (2, 5) (1 LEFT) or continue exploring the left wall (0, 5).\n\n**B. Move UP to (4, 6):**\n*   **Result:** No apple. Moves towards (4, 8) and (4, 9).\n*   **Future Position (4, 6):** Targets are (4, 8) (2 UP) or (6, 6) (2 RIGHT). This delays the immediate apple at (3, 5).\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n*   **Result:** No apple. Moves away from immediate nearby apples (3, 5), (2, 5).\n*   **Future Position (5, 5):** Closer to (5, 8) or (6, 6). Suboptimal compared to LEFT.\n\n**3. Decision:**\n\nMove LEFT to (3, 5) to consume the next immediate apple. This maintains high momentum and utilizes the gathered cluster of apples in the center-left.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake #0 Projection:**\nS0 is at (7, 8). Body [(7, 7), (8, 7)].\nNearest apples to S0:\n1. (6, 8): 1 LEFT. **Primary Target.**\n2. (5, 8): 2 LEFT.\n3. (9, 7): 2 RIGHT, 1 DOWN.\n4. (6, 6): 2 DOWN, 1 LEFT.\n5.

This is far from my head (3, 5) and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT7: From (3, 5), move LEFT to (2, 5) to eat the next apple, pending safety/availability.

The board state diagram appears to misrepresent the apple at (5, 9) as an 'A' in the board state *before* moves were made, but the narrative implies S0 ate it to get to (5, 9). I will rely on the provided apple list and update my understanding based on the current head/body positions. *Wait, let me re-evaluate the enemy move*.\n    *   *S0 Last Turn (T8):* Head (5, 8). Apples remaining included (5, 9). S0 moved UP to (5, 9) and ate.\n    *   *My Last Turn (T8):* Head (2, 5). Apples remaining included (1, 5). I moved LEFT to (1, 5) and ate.\n    *   The apple list provided for Turn 9 shows: (4, 9) is still an apple, but (5, 9) is NOT in the list. This confirms S0 ate (5, 9). (1, 5) is also NOT in the list. This confirms I ate (1, 5).\n\n**1.

Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) against Apple Proximity:**\n\nThe snake is currently at (1, 5).\n\n*   **Nearest apples:**\n    1.  (0, 5): 1 LEFT. **Immediate Target.**\n    2.  (1, 6): 1 UP. **Immediate Target.**\n    3.  (0, 3): 2 DOWN, 1 LEFT.\n    4.  (1, 2): 3 DOWN.\n    5.  (3, 2): 3 DOWN, 2 RIGHT (blocked by my body (2, 5)).\n\nWe have two 1-step apple options: UP to (1, 6) or LEFT to (0, 5).\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (0, 5):**\n*   **Result:** EAT Apple (0, 5). S1 length increases to 7. Score 6.\n*   **Future Position (0, 5):** Excellent access to (0, 3) (2 DOWN) and (0, 1) (4 DOWN). Also keeps options open back towards (1, 6) (1 RIGHT, 1 UP).\n\n**B. Move UP to (1, 6):**\n*   **Result:** EAT Apple (1, 6). S1 length increases to 7. Score 6.\n*   **Future Position (1, 6):** Excellent access to (6, 6) (5 RIGHT) or (4, 8) (2 UP, 3 RIGHT). Less direct access to the bottom apples (0, 3), (0, 1).\n\n**C. Move DOWN to (1, 4):**\n*   **Result:** No apple.\n*   **Future Position (1, 4):** Moves away from the dense apple clusters on the edge and potentially cramps the path back to the left wall if I want to harvest (0, 3)/(0, 1). This is the least preferred option.\n\n**3. Strategic Tie-Breaker (LEFT vs. UP):**\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are excellent moves. We need to consider which path offers better long-term harvesting and safety.\n\n*   **LEFT path (Targeting (0, Y)):** This path harvests the leftmost column (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 1). This is a safe area, far away from S0.\n    *   T9: (1, 5) -> (0, 5) (Eat)\n    *   T10: (0, 5) -> (0, 4) or (0, 3)? (0, 3) is 2 steps away. (0, 4) or (1, 5) (tail is leaving 2, 5, so safe).\n*   **UP path (Targeting (Y, 6)+ and then potentially (4, 8)):** This path harvests (1, 6) and then might move right towards (6, 6) or up towards (4, 8).\n    *   T9: (1, 5) -> (1, 6) (Eat)\n    *   T10: (1, 6) -> (2, 6) or (1, 7). This keeps me in the middle-top of the board.\n\nGiven the density of apples on the left wall ((0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 1)) which are relatively unthreatened, continuing down the left edge (Move LEFT) seems slightly more efficient for maximizing sequential apple eating and keeping distance from S0, whose head (5, 9) is currently focused on the top right area (closest apples: (4, 9), (9, 7)).\n\nIf I take (1, 6), I still have (0, 5) available, but if I take (0, 5), I still have (1, 6) available. Both leaves an apple 2 steps away.\n\nLet's look at the movement required post-consumption:\n*   If LEFT to (0, 5): Next target (0, 3) (2 steps: DOWN, DOWN) or (1, 6) (2 steps: RIGHT, UP).\n*   If UP to (1, 6): Next target (0, 5) (2 steps: LEFT, DOWN) or perhaps towards (6, 6) (5 steps E, 0 N).\n\nChoosing LEFT seems marginally better for isolating my harvest path along the safe left edge while still retaining easy access to (1, 6).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT9: Move LEFT to (0, 5) and eat.\nT10: Continue harvesting down the left wall towards (0, 3).\nT11: Continue harvesting towards (0, 1). Then look to cycle back to (1, 6) or (1, 2).\n\nLEFT",

Body [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 7. Apples: 6. (Ate (0, 5) last turn.)\n*   **Enemy Snake 0 (ID 0):** Head (4, 9). Body [(5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]. Length 7. Apples: 6. (S0 moved LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9). This move did *not* collect an apple, as (4, 9) is still listed as an apple. S0 is now on (4, 9), length 7.)\n*   **Apples remaining (15 total):** (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (0, 3), (1, 6), (4, 1), (4, 8), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 2), (1, 3).\n    *   Note: (4, 9) is NOT in the remaining apple list, even though the board diagram shows '0 T' at (4, 9) and the head of S0 is (4, 9). This implies S0 ate (4, 9) or the list provided is the *current* state of apples after an apple was eaten. Let's rely on the apple list provided: if an apple is not in this list, it's gone regardless of board depiction or previous moves.\n    *   *Correction on S0's length:* S0's body is 6 segments, Head is 1 segment. Total length 7. If S0 ate (4, 9) on Turn 9, its previous length must have been 6. If S0 *didn't* eat an apple, its length would have remained 6, and the board state body segments would have shifted. Given the body segment count (6) and head (1), the total length is 7. If the previous length was 6, then S0 must have eaten an apple, which should have been (4, 9). Since (4, 9) is not in the remaining list, I will proceed assuming S0 ate an apple and is now length 7, located at (4, 9).\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (0, 5)):**\n\n*   **Boundary Checks (0-9):**\n    *   UP to (0, 6): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (0, 4): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (-1, 5): **Deadly.** (Off board).\n    *   RIGHT to (1, 5): Safe.\n*   **Collision Checks (My Body):** My current body is [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)].\n    *   RIGHT to (1, 5): Hits body segment (B1). **Deadly.** (Since I ate an apple, the tail segment (5, 4) remains, and the segment (1, 5) remains immediately behind the head.)\n*   **Collision Checks (Enemy Snake 0 - Head (4, 9), Body [(5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]):**\n    *   No immediate collision risk.\n\nSafe moves for S1: UP, DOWN.\n\n**2. Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (UP, DOWN) against Apple Proximity:**\n\nThe snake is currently at (0, 5).\n\n*   **Nearest apples:**\n    1.  (0, 3): 2 DOWN. **Immediate Target (2 steps).**\n    2.  (1, 6): 1 UP, 1 RIGHT (2 steps total, but RIGHT is blocked by my body).\n    3.  (0, 1): 4 DOWN.\n    4.  (1, 2): 3 DOWN, 1 RIGHT.\n\n*   **A. Move DOWN to (0, 4):**\n    *   **Result:** No apple. Moves directly toward the next set of apples (0, 3) and (0, 1).\n    *   **Future:** From (0, 4), I can move DOWN to (0, 3) and eat next turn. This is a guaranteed apple sequence.\n\n*   **B. Move UP to (0, 6):**\n    *   **Result:** No apple. Moves away from the strong apple cluster below.\n    *   **Future:** From (0, 6), I could aim for (1, 6) (1 RIGHT), or (4, 8) (2 UP, 4 RIGHT). If I move RIGHT to (1, 6) next turn, I eat an apple.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nI have a choice between securing the immediate sequential harvest on the left wall (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN) or switching direction toward (1, 6).\n\nIf I choose UP:\nT10: (0, 5) -> (0, 6). Safe.\nT11: (0, 6) -> (1, 6). Eat Apple (1, 6).\n\nIf I choose DOWN:\nT10: (0, 5) -> (0, 4). Safe.\nT11: (0, 4) -> (0, 3). Eat Apple (0, 3).\n\nBoth paths lead to an apple in 2 turns. However, the DOWN path keeps me on the border, minimizing exposure and continuing the previous strategy of clearing the left edge.\n\nFurthermore, if I move DOWN, my previous head position (1, 5) and (2, 5) become available later, potentially making it easier to maneuver back up if needed, or transition to the interior.\n\nLet's look at potential enemy interaction. S0 is still focused high at (4, 9). The top right area is congested with S0's body. S0 will likely move right towards (9, 7) or down towards (4, 8). My current location is safe from S0. Since there's no immediate pressure, I should choose the most predictable and efficient harvest path.\n\nMoving DOWN to set up eating (0, 3) next turn is the most direct application of the bordering strategy started last turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT10: Move DOWN to (0, 4).\nT11: Move DOWN to (0, 3) and eat.\nT12: Move DOWN to (0, 2).\nT13: Move DOWN to (0, 1) and eat.\nThen, re-evaluate to target (1, 2), (1, 3), or cycle back up towards (1, 6).\n\nDOWN",

The current body listed is [(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. This body list *does* show the shift correctly: (0, 5) is the new first segment, and the old tail (5, 4) is gone. Length remains 7.*\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head (4, 8). Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]. Length 8. Apples: 7. (S0 moved DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8). S0 collected the apple at (4, 8) last turn. Length increased from 7 to 8.)\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14 total):** (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (0, 3), (1, 6), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 2), (1, 3), (8, 6). (Wait, the list has 15 apples. Let me recount the provided list: (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (0, 3), (1, 6), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 2), (1, 3), (8, 6). Total 15. The previous turn's list had 15 apples, and S0 ate one apple (4, 8). Either the Turn 10 analysis was wrong about the apple list, or the Turn 11 list is not fully updated. Let's assume the provided Turn 11 apple list is 100% correct, meaning (4, 8) is NOT an apple now, even if it was there before S0 moved. Let's rely strictly on the provided 15 coordinates.)\n\n**Apple Check (15 apples):** (6, 6)A, (8, 0)A, (0, 1)A, (9, 7)A, (0, 3)A, (1, 6)A, (4, 1)A, (3, 2)A, (4, 0)A, (5, 3)A, (6, 4)A, (1, 2)A, (9, 2)A, (1, 3)A, (8, 6)A.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (0, 4)):**\n\n*   **Boundary Checks (0-9):**\n    *   UP to (0, 5): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (0, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (-1, 4): **Deadly.** (Off board).\n    *   RIGHT to (1, 4): Safe.\n*   **Collision Checks (My Body):** Body: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n    *   UP to (0, 5): Hits my body segment. **Deadly.**\n*   **Collision Checks (Enemy Snake 0 - Head (4, 8), Body [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]):**\n    *   No immediate collision risk.\n\nSafe moves for S1: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\nThe snake is currently at (0, 4).\n\n*   **A. Move DOWN to (0, 3):**\n    *   (0, 3) is an apple (A).\n    *   **Result:** EAT APPLE. Length increases to 8. Score 7.\n    *   **Next Turn:** Head at (0, 3). Options likely include RIGHT to (1, 3) (apple) or DOWN to (0, 2) (empty). This is the optimal harvest path.\n\n*   **B. Move RIGHT to (1, 4):**\n    *   (1, 4) is empty (.).\n    *   **Result:** Move towards the interior, setting up for (1, 3) or (1, 2) or (3, 2).\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** The cost to get to the next apple (0, 3) is 1 move DOWN. The cost to get to (1, 3) would be 1 move RIGHT, 1 move DOWN (2 moves). If I move RIGHT now, I am 1 move away from the left wall, complicating the path to (0, 1). This move sacrifices the immediate guarantee for greater complexity.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 3) is a guaranteed apple, continues the pattern of clearing the left side, and keeps future options open for (0, 1) and cycling back up. This is the clear best move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT11: Move DOWN to (0, 3) and eat.\nT12: Move DOWN to (0, 2).\nT13: Move DOWN to (0, 1) and eat.\nT14: Move RIGHT to (1, 1).\nT15: Move UP to (1, 2) and eat, or UP to (1, 3) and eat, depending on pathing needs and internal congestion.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Remaining Safe Moves (DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\nThe snake is currently at (0, 3). We are clearing the left wall.\n\n*   **A. Move DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   (0, 2) is empty (.).\n    *   **Result:** Continues hugging the left wall, setting up for the apple at (0, 1) next turn. This is the path we planned. The body at (0, 4) will shift to (0, 3), keeping me safe.\n\n*   **B. Move RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n    *   (1, 3) is an apple (A).\n    *   **Result:** EAT APPLE. Length increases. Score 8.\n    *   This is a highly attractive option as it guarantees an apple immediately.\n    *   **Consequence:** If I move right, my head is now (1, 3). My next target would be (1, 2) (apple) or (0, 3) (my body segment soon to be clear, but still congested). This move pulls me away from the (0, 1) apple, which is critical for clearing the periphery. However, apple harvesting always takes priority if safe and efficient.\n\n**3. Comparison and Strategy Refinement:**\n\n*   **Option A (DOWN to (0, 2)):** 1 move until the next apple (0, 1). Costs 1 move, gains 0 score this turn.\n*   **Option B (RIGHT to (1, 3)):** 0 moves until the next apple (1, 3). Costs 0 moves (since apple is immediate), gains 1 score this turn.\n\nSince both moves are safe, prioritize the immediate apple (1, 3). This is closer to the current head position (0, 3) than any other apple.\n\n*If I move RIGHT to (1, 3):*\nHead (1, 3). Next targets: (1, 2) [Apple] or (2, 3) [Empty] or potentially returning for (0, 1) [Apple].\n\n*If I move DOWN to (0, 2):*\nHead (0, 2). Next targets: (0, 1) [Apple].\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 3) is objectively better as it grants an immediate apple score, setting us up nicely in the lower left quadrant where many other apples reside: (1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2).\n\n**4. Final Check for Collisions (RIGHT to (1, 3)):**\n1.  (1, 3) is on board. (Safe)\n2.  (1, 3) is not my body. (Safe)\n3.  (1, 3) is not S0's body. (S0 is far away near (4, 7)). (Safe)\n4.  S0 Head (4, 7). S0 could move UP (4, 8, hits body), DOWN (4, 6), LEFT (3, 7), RIGHT (5, 7). None of S0's moves approach (1, 3). (Safe)\n\nThe move RIGHT is sound and lucrative.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT12: Move RIGHT to (1, 3) and eat.\nT13: Move DOWN to (1, 2) and eat, continuing the harvest of the bottom area, or move towards (0, 1) if (1, 2) becomes dangerous. (1, 2) is an apple.\nT14: Move right/down to consolidate the remaining lower apples (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (8, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

S0 did not eat an apple (no apple at (4, 6)), so its tail (7, 8) was removed.)\n    *   Apples collected: 7.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14 total):** (6, 6), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 2), (8, 6), (6, 2), (3, 4). (Note: (1, 3) was eaten last turn.)\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 3)):**\n\n*   **Board Boundaries (0-9):** All moves are on board.\n*   **My Body Segments:** [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Safe? | Content |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---: | :------ |\n| UP   | (1, 4)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) |\n| DOWN | (1, 2)        | No collision.   | YES   | Apple (A) |\n| LEFT | (0, 3)        | Hits body (H->B1). | NO    | Body (T) |\n| RIGHT| (2, 3)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) |\n\nSafe moves for S1: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe goal is to harvest apples in the lower-left quadrant.\n\n*   **A. Move DOWN to (1, 2):**\n    *   EAT APPLE (1, 2). This is a great move. It increases the score and length immediately.\n    *   Next potential targets: (0, 2), (2, 2) (empty), (1, 1) (empty), (0, 1) (apple). Sets up nicely for (0, 1).\n    *   S0 is at (4, 6) and is no threat.\n\n*   **B. Move UP to (1, 4):**\n    *   (1, 4) is empty.\n    *   This moves S1 away from the high concentration of apples in the bottom band: (0, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (8, 0).\n    *   It risks getting trapped against the dense body segments (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5).\n\n*   **C. Move RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    *   (2, 3) is empty.\n    *   This is a neutral move, allowing S1 to pivot towards the central apples (3, 2), (5, 3).\n    *   It does not prioritize the closest apple and might allow the growing tail to block access to (1, 2) or (0, 1) later if (2, 3) is a dead-end direction.\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (S0 Head at (4, 6)):**\nS0 is far away and poses no threat to S1's immediate moves.\n\n*   S0's safe moves (considering its immediate body [(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]):\n    *   UP to (4, 7): Hits own body. Unsafe.\n    *   DOWN to (4, 5): Safe. (Hits my body (4, 5)? Yes. **Deadly for S0 if it moves DOWN.**)\n    *   LEFT to (3, 6): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (5, 6): Safe.\n\nS0 is likely to move LEFT to (3, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 6). S0 cannot move DOWN safely unless my body moves out of (4, 5). S0 is currently far from S1 (1, 3).\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN to (1, 2) is the optimal choice as it secures an immediate apple score, continues the planned harvesting of the bottom edge, and maintains mobility towards (0, 1).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. T13: Move DOWN to (1, 2) and eat. New head (1, 2).\n2. T14: Target (0, 1) [Apple]. Move LEFT from (1, 2) to (0, 2) [Empty].\n3. T15: Move DOWN from (0, 2) to (0, 1) and eat.\n4. Then focus on (4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe goal is to continue harvesting apples in the bottom band. The closest apples are: (1, 1), (0, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0).\n\n*   **A. Move DOWN to (1, 1):**\n    *   EAT APPLE (1, 1). Excellent, immediate score and length increase.\n    *   Sets up the head at (1, 1). Next target is (0, 1) (Apple) or (2, 1) (empty, towards 4, 1). This is the best move.\n\n*   **B. Move LEFT to (0, 2):**\n    *   (0, 2) is empty.\n    *   This sets up for (0, 1) (Apple) on the next turn. This is a good sequential move if (1, 1) were not available. Since (1, 1) is available immediately, moving to (0, 2) should be secondary.\n\n*   **C. Move RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) is empty.\n    *   Moves S1 away from (1, 1) and (0, 1). Only useful if setting up for (3, 2), (4, 1), or (4, 0). (3, 2) is the closest apple in that direction (2 squares away).\n\n**Proritization:** Moving DOWN to eat the apple at (1, 1) is the highest priority safe move.\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (H1 at (1, 2), H0 at (5, 6)):**\nS0 is far away and poses no threat. S0 is likely moving towards the central apples (6, 6), (8, 6), or perhaps exploring upwards. S0 is clearly focused on the upper-right quadrant now. S1 is focused on the lower-left quadrant.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Move 14:**\nThe optimal move is DOWN to immediately consume the apple at (1, 1).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. T14 (Current): Move DOWN to (1, 1) and eat. New head (1, 1).\n2. T15: Target (0, 1) [Apple]. Move LEFT from (1, 1) to (0, 1) and eat.\n3. T16: Target (4, 1) or (4, 0). Move RIGHT from (0, 1) to (1, 1) (now empty) or (0, 0). If going for (4, 1), move UP/RIGHT sequence. From (0, 1), UP to (0, 2) then RIGHT towards (4, X).\n\nDOWN",

The list of remaining apples also shows (7, 4) (as part of the final list: (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (9, 2), (8, 6), (6, 2), (3, 4), (3, 1), (7, 4) - Wait, the provided list in the input is 15 apples long. My count on Turn 14 was 14. Let's re-verify the input apples for T15.*\n    *   Input Apples: (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 3), (6, 4), (9, 2), (8, 6), (6, 2), (3, 4), (3, 1), (7, 4).

This seems consistent with the game environment.\n\n**Current Board Visualization:**\n(T = Snake 1 Body, 0 = Snake 0 Head, 1 = Snake 1 Head, A = Apple)\n\n 9 . . . . T T . . . .\n 8 . . . .

Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 1)):**\n\n*   **My Body Segments (B1):** [(1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Safe? | Content |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---: | :------ |\n| UP   | (1, 2)        | Hits body (H->B1). | NO    | Body (T) |\n| DOWN | (1, 0)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) |\n| LEFT | (0, 1)        | No collision.   | YES   | Apple (A) |\n| RIGHT| (2, 1)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) |\n\nSafe moves for S1: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nS1 is in the lower-left corner, continuing to harvest. The immediate target is Apple (0, 1).\n\n*   **A. Move LEFT to (0, 1):**\n    *   EAT APPLE (0, 1). This is the best move, securing another apple and lengthening the snake.\n    *   New head (0, 1). Next, we can move towards the (4, 1) or (4, 0) group, likely via RIGHT to (1, 1) then up/right.\n\n*   **B. Move DOWN to (1, 0):**\n    *   (1, 0) is empty.\n    *   This is a diversion from the immediate apple at (0, 1). It puts S1 closer to (4, 0) (4 squares away) but further from (4, 1) if S1 goes (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0). (0, 1) is a higher priority.\n\n*   **C. Move RIGHT to (2, 1):**\n    *   (2, 1) is empty.\n    *   This moves S1 towards (4, 1) (2 squares away) and (3, 1) (1 square away). This is a good sequential option after completing the (0, 1) apple.\n\n**Proritization:** Moving LEFT to eat the apple at (0, 1) is the highest priority safe move.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position (H0 at (6, 6)):**\nSnake 0 is far away and continues to focus on the upper/middle area. No collision risk or race for the current apples. S0 is likely targeting (8, 6) or (9, 7).\n\n**4. Conclusion on Move 15:**\nThe optimal move is LEFT to immediately consume the apple at (0, 1).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. T15 (Current): Move LEFT to (0, 1) and eat. New head (0, 1).\n2. T16: Target (4, 1) or (3, 1). Move RIGHT to (1, 1) (now empty).\n3. T17: Move RIGHT to (2, 1).\n4. T18: Move RIGHT to (3, 1) or UP to (2, 2). If (3, 1) is available (Apple), take it, then proceed to (4, 1) (Apple) or (4, 0) (Apple). We are strongly placed to clear the lower band.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe immediate goal is to access the cluster of apples at (3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), and (3, 4).\n\n*   **A. Move UP to (0, 2):**\n    *   (0, 2) is empty.\n    *   This is a safe setup move. From (0, 2), safe moves might be UP to (0, 3) (hits body T) or RIGHT to (1, 2) (hits body T). Oh, wait.\n        *   If H1 moves to (0, 2), the tail (4, 4) will still be there.\n        *   The new body segment list starts with (0, 1), then (1, 1), (1, 2)...\n        *   From (0, 2):\n            *   UP to (0, 3): Hits B1 (0, 3). NO.\n            *   RIGHT to (1, 2): Hits B1 (1, 2). NO.\n    *   Moving UP to (0, 2) appears to trap me into a corner, as my body is laid out at (0, 3) and (1, 2). I cannot proceed beyond (0, 2) safely on the next turn unless the body segment at (4, 4) becomes the new tail (which it will, unless I eat). If I don't eat, (1, 1) becomes empty.\n    *   Let's check the path: (0, 1) -> (0, 2). New B1: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)...]\n        *   Next move from (0, 2):\n            *   UP to (0, 3) is a collision.\n            *   RIGHT to (1, 2) is a collision.\n        *   This move is a trap! *Eliminate UP.*\n\n*   **B. Move DOWN to (0, 0):**\n    *   (0, 0) is empty.\n    *   This moves S1 away from the central apple action. From (0, 0):\n        *   UP to (0, 1) (will be B1). NO.\n        *   RIGHT to (1, 0) (empty). YES.\n    *   If I move DOWN, I can then move RIGHT to (1, 0), then towards (4, 0). This path is slightly longer but guaranteed safe and keeps me moving toward the apples.\n\n**Re-evaluating the desired path to (3, 1) / (4, 1) / (4, 0):**\nThe ideal sequence was:\nT15: LEFT to (0, 1) (EAT) [DONE]\nT16: RIGHT to (1, 1) (NOW EMPTY, since I ate). NO, (1, 1) is the immediate neck segment. Moving there KILLS ME.\n\nMy rationale on T15 was flawed regarding the immediate neighbor (1, 1) becoming safe. When you move to eat, the tail stays, but the *neck segment* remains your body. Moving into the neck is a fatal backwards move.\n\n**Therefore, S1 must break away from the body block (1, 1) and (1, 2) and (0, 3).**\n\nSince UP is also a dead end:\n(0, 1) -> (0, 2) [Safe]\nNext turn (T17), New H1=(0, 2). Body starts at (0, 1).\nSafe moves from (0, 2):\n1. UP to (0, 3): Hits B1 (0, 3). DEAD.\n2. DOWN to (0, 1): Hits B1 (0, 1, the neck). DEAD.\n3. RIGHT to (1, 2): Hits B1 (1, 2). DEAD.\n*(If I move UP, I die on T17. UP is not a viable starting move.)*\n\nOnly **DOWN to (0, 0)** remains as the sole non-trapping safe move.\n\n**3. Execution: Move DOWN to (0, 0)**\n\nThis move places the snake at the bottom left corner, freeing the head from the congested body area around (1, 1) and (1, 2).\n\n*   T16: Move DOWN to (0, 0). Length 12.\n*   T17: H1 at (0, 0). Body starts at (0, 1).\n    *   Safe options from (0, 0): UP (into (0, 1) neck -> NO), RIGHT (to (1, 0) -> YES).\n*   T17: Move RIGHT to (1, 0). Length 12.\n*   T18: H1 at (1, 0). Body starts at (0, 0).\n    *   Safe options from (1, 0): UP (to (1, 1) -> YES, now empty), RIGHT (to (2, 0) -> YES).\n    *   (1, 1) contains body (1, 1) from T16. Tail (4, 4) if no apple eaten. Wait, the T16 body is: [(1, 1), (1, 2)...]. If I didn't eat, the tail pops off (4, 4). (1, 1) is no longer part of the body when moving (0, 1) -> (0, 0) -> (1, 0).\n    *   The segment (1, 1) will be part of the body when H is at (0, 0).\n        *   H(0, 0). B: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)...].\n    *   If I move (1, 0) -> (1, 1), I hit B1 (1, 1). DEAD.\n\nLet's re-examine the body segment safety carefully.\n\nCurrent body segments: H(0, 1), B [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n\n**Scenario A: Move DOWN to (0, 0) [Safe move on T16]**\nNew H: (0, 0). New Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]. (4, 4) popped off.\n\nT17 from H(0, 0):\n1. UP to (0, 1): Hit neck. DEAD.\n2. RIGHT to (1, 0): Safe (empty).\n\nT18 from H(1, 0):\nNew Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)...]. (4, 5) popped off.\n1. UP to (1, 1): Hit B1 (1, 1). DEAD.\n2. RIGHT to (2, 0): Safe (empty).\n3. DOWN... OOB.\n\nThis path (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT) is safe and leads towards the apples (4, 0) and (3, 1), (4, 1). This is the only viable path to escape the congestion caused by eating the apple at (0, 1).\n\n**Scenario B: Move UP to (0, 2) [Eliminated by trap]**\nIf I move UP to (0, 2). New H: (0, 2). New Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3)...]. (4, 4) popped off.\nT17 from H(0, 2):\n1. UP to (0, 3): Hit B1 (0, 3). DEAD.\n2. DOWN to (0, 1): Hit neck. DEAD.\n3. RIGHT to (1, 2): Hit B1 (1, 2). DEAD.\nDefinitely a confirmed trap.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only safe and viable move that leads to further apple consumption is DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Next 3 turns):**\n1. T16: DOWN to (0, 0). Escape corner, prepare to move right.\n2. T17: RIGHT to (1, 0). Move along the bottom edge.\n3. T18: RIGHT to (2, 0). Continue towards the apple cluster at (4, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1).\n\nDOWN",

Tail (4, 5) pops off.\n\nNext turn (T18) from H(1, 0):\n*   UP to (1, 1): Hits B1 (1, 1). NO.\n*   DOWN to (1, -1): OOB. NO.\n*   LEFT to (0, 0): Hits B1 (0, 0, neck). NO.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 0): Safe (empty). YES.\n\nThis confirms the immediate necessary sequence: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0).\n\n(2, 0) is safe, and from there (T19), the snake can move to (3, 0) or (2, 1) (both safe) to navigate towards (4, 0) or (3, 1). The path remains open and directed towards food.\n\nRIGHT",

Long-term Strategy Check:**\n\nThe current cluster of apples: (4, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2). This is the best immediate feeding ground.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 0):\nNew H: (2, 0).

Enemy Consideration:**\nEnemy H0 is at (6, 3).\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   UP to (6, 4): Hits B0 (neck). NO.\n*   DOWN to (6, 2): Hitting apple (6, 2). Highly likely move.\n*   LEFT to (5, 3): Hits apple (5, 3). Likely move.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 3): Safe.\n\nIf H0 moves to (6, 2), it will eat an apple and start moving towards the bottom edge/center. This area is far from my current path, and there is no risk of head-on collision on T18.\n\nThe only safe and viable move is RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving right along the bottom bank to consume the apples at (4, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), and (3, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

Since no apple was eaten, the tail segment (2, 5) is indeed popped off.*\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (2, 0)):**\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Safe? | Content | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---: | :------ | :---- |\n| UP   | (2, 1)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) | Leads toward apples (3, 2), (3, 1). |\n| DOWN | (2, -1)       | Out of bounds.  | NO    | OOB     | |\n| LEFT | (1, 0)        | Hits body (neck).| NO    | Body (T) | Immediate neck segment. |\n| RIGHT| (3, 0)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) | Leads toward apple (4, 0). |\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 0):** This is a direct path to the nearest apple at (4, 0). Distance: 1 move to (3, 0), 1 more move to (4, 0) (Apple). This is highly desirable.\n*   **UP to (2, 1):** This move angles into the board. From (2, 1), the snake has options: (3, 1) (Apple), (2, 2) (Empty), (1, 1) (Body). It takes 2 moves to reach (3, 1), which is further than (4, 0).\n\nThe objective is to secure the cluster of apples at the bottom as quickly as possible. (4, 0) is the most immediate apple.\n\n**3. Enemy Consideration (H0 at (5, 3)):**\n\nThe enemy is currently at (5, 3).\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   UP to (5, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (5, 2): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (4, 3): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 3): Hits B0 (neck). NO.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 0). H0 is far away and not threatening the path to (4, 0).\n\n*   If H0 moves LEFT to (4, 3): Threatens the middle of the board.\n*   If H0 moves UP to (5, 4): Stays high.\n*   If H0 moves DOWN to (5, 2): Stays central.\n\nThere is no collision risk for my move RIGHT.\n\n**4. Decision:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 0) is the optimal path to secure the apple at (4, 0) on the next turn (T20). This maintains the momentum of clearing the bottom edge.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (for Turn 20 onwards):**\nAfter consuming (4, 0), the snake should aim for the cluster of apples just above and to the left: (3, 1), (4, 1), and then potentially (3, 2) or (6, 2). Moving UP from (4, 0) to (4, 1) (Apple) or LEFT/UP to (3, 1) (Apple) are the next logical steps. Prioritize securing the low-hanging fruit before moving to the center.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safe Moves (Prioritizing Apples and Enemy collision avoidance):**\n\nH1 can move to (4, 0) [RIGHT] or (3, 1) [UP]. Both moves result in eating an apple and growing.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 0) (Apple):**\n    *   Score: +1 apple.\n    *   New Head: (4, 0).\n    *   This keeps the snake low on the board, securing the bottom edge.\n    *   Future options from (4, 0): UP to (4, 1) (Apple), LEFT to (3, 0) (Body - not safe immediately), RIGHT to (5, 0) (Empty).\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 1) (Apple):**\n    *   Score: +1 apple.\n    *   New Head: (3, 1).\n    *   This moves the snake slightly inward.\n    *   Future options from (3, 1): UP to (3, 2) (Apple), LEFT to (2, 1) (Empty), RIGHT to (4, 1) (Apple). Extremely strong follow-up options, reaching three apples in two moves maximum if needed.\n\n**3. Enemy Consideration (H0 at (5, 2)):**\n\nH0 has several local apples: (6, 2), (4, 1), (3, 2), (7, 4).\nSafe moves for H0 (5, 2):\n*   UP to (5, 3) (Body - neck) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (5, 1) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   LEFT to (4, 2) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 2) (Apple) -> YES.\n\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (6, 2), it secures that apple.\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (4, 2), it approaches the central apples.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nThere is no direct risk of a head-on collision or collision with the enemy body regardless of whether I choose UP or RIGHT, as H0 is far away at (5, 2).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and RIGHT:**\n\nBoth moves guarantee an apple this turn. We should look at long-term apple consolidation.\n\n*   If I go **RIGHT to (4, 0)**: Next target is (4, 1) (UP). (3, 1) and (3, 2) are also available.\n*   If I go **UP to (3, 1)**: Next target is (3, 2) (UP) or (4, 1) (RIGHT).\n\nThe move UP to (3, 1) opens the path to a dense cluster: (3, 2) and (4, 1) are directly accessible from (3, 1).\nIf I move UP:\nT+1: H1 at (3, 1). Apples: (3, 2) [UP], (4, 1) [RIGHT].\nIf H0 moved to (6, 2), it is now at (6, 2). It might target the high apples or (7, 4). H0 is still not a competitive threat for apples (3, 2) or (4, 1).\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\nT+1: H1 at (4, 0). Apples: (4, 1) [UP]. (3, 1) [LEFT] is now blocked by the body at (3, 0).\nThis traps me slightly more, forcing the next move to (4, 1) or (5, 0).\n\nMoving **UP to (3, 1)** is superior because it provides immediate access to two more apples ((3, 2) and (4, 1)) on the subsequent turn, enabling rapid apple collection in this relatively safe section of the board, maximizing flexibility.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Note (for Turn 21 onwards):**\nSnake should move towards (3, 2) or (4, 1) next, prioritizing (3, 2) as it is directly UP, maintaining the upward sweep. Continue clearing the apple clusters on the lower left/center of the board ((3, 2), (4, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5)).\n\nUP",

Both are apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves leading to Apples:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 2) (Apple):**\n    *   Score: +1 apple.\n    *   New Head: (3, 2).\n    *   Future options from (3, 2): UP to (3, 3) (Empty), RIGHT to (4, 2) (Apple), LEFT to (2, 2) (Body T). This maintains upward movement towards another cluster (3, 4), (4, 5).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 1) (Apple):**\n    *   Score: +1 apple.\n    *   New Head: (4, 1).\n    *   Future options from (4, 1): UP to (4, 2) (Apple), RIGHT to (5, 1) (Empty), DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple). Extremely strong follow-up options, potentially leading to 3 apples in 2 moves: (4, 2) and (4, 0).\n\n**3. Enemy Consideration (H0 at (6, 2)):**\n\nH0 has local apples: (7, 4), (9, 2), (8, 6).\nSafe moves for H0 (6, 2):\n*   UP to (6, 3) (Body - neck) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (6, 1) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   LEFT to (5, 2) (Body - neck) -> NO.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 2) (Empty) -> YES.\n\nH0 is highly constrained by its body. It is likely H0 will move DOWN to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 2). If it goes RIGHT, it heads towards the right edge apples. If it goes DOWN, it might try to secure (8, 0) or move to the middle.\n\nCrucially, H0 is 2 units away from (4, 2) and 3 units away from (3, 2) and (4, 1). H1 can certainly secure the next apple without interference.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and RIGHT:**\n\nBoth moves are excellent. Let's compare the subsequent apple collection potential:\n\n*   If H1 moves **UP to (3, 2)**:\n    *   T+1: H1 at (3, 2). Next targets: (4, 2) [RIGHT] (1 unit), (3, 4) [UP+UP] (2 units).\n*   If H1 moves **RIGHT to (4, 1)**:\n    *   T+1: H1 at (4, 1). Next targets: (4, 2) [UP] (1 unit), (4, 0) [DOWN] (1 unit).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 1) gives us the immediate choice between two adjacent apples ((4, 2) and (4, 0)) on the following turn. This provides slightly better guaranteed apple density capture and helps clear the bottom-left corner more efficiently. The snake's body is positioned such that moving right then up/down helps straighten out the tail flow.\n\nLet's prioritize the densest local cluster cleanup. (4, 1) leads directly to (4, 2) and (4, 0).\n\n**Rethink:** If I go RIGHT to (4, 1), and then UP to (4, 2), I have cleaned up (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2). I can then look towards (3, 4), or drop back for (4, 0) if necessary, or move right.\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 2), and then RIGHT to (4, 2), I have cleaned up (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2). This is also excellent.\n\nThe difference is minor, but moving RIGHT to (4, 1) places the head in a strong central position to consolidate the four apples in columns 3 and 4 at y=0, 1, 2. (We already have (3, 1). We target (4, 1), then (4, 2), then maybe (4, 0) or move up to (3, 4)).\n\nI choose RIGHT to maximize local options and consolidate the apples in column 4.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Clear apples in the 4th column (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5). Then pivot towards the (3, 4) / (1, 6) area, leveraging the cleared space.\n\nRIGHT",

Both are apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake (H0 at (7, 2)) Movement:**\n\nH0 currently sits on (7, 2). Its neck is (6, 2).\nSafe moves for H0:\n*   UP to (7, 3) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   DOWN to (7, 1) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   LEFT to (6, 2) (Body - neck) -> NO.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 2) (Empty) -> YES.\n\nH0 has several local apples it might chase: (7, 4), (9, 2), (8, 6), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7).\n(7, 4) is 2 units up. (9, 2) is 2 units right. (7, 0) is 2 units down. (8, 0) is 3 units distance.\n\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (8, 2), it threatens (9, 2).\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (7, 1), it threatens (7, 0) and (8, 0).\nIf H0 moves UP to (7, 3), it targets (7, 4).\n\nH0 is not threatening H1's current targets ((4, 2), (4, 0)).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and DOWN (Apples):**\n\nWe are at (4, 1).\n*   **Move UP to (4, 2) (Apple):**\n    *   New Head: (4, 2).\n    *   Future options from (4, 2): UP to (4, 3) (Empty), DOWN to (4, 1) (Now body), LEFT to (3, 2) (Apple), RIGHT to (5, 2) (Body T).\n    *   This move sets us up perfectly to grab (3, 2) easily, consolidating three more apples in the vicinity: (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple):**\n    *   New Head: (4, 0).\n    *   Future options from (4, 0): UP to (4, 1) (Now body), DOWN (Out of bounds) -> NO, LEFT to (3, 0) (Body T) -> NO, RIGHT to (5, 0) (Empty).\n    *   This move severely restricts immediate safe movement. We must go RIGHT to (5, 0) or potentially wait for (3, 0) to clear, which traps us slightly at the bottom edge.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 2) is far superior because it:\n1.  Cleans Apple (4, 2).\n2.  Opens up movement towards Apple (3, 2) immediately (LEFT).\n3.  Keeps us away from the bottom wall (y=0) trap and closer to the central and upper apples (3, 4) and (4, 5).\n\nBy moving UP then LEFT, we secure three apples in three turns (assuming we already ate (3, 1) and (4, 1) and will eat (4, 2) and (3, 2)). This is the most efficient local farming route. After (3, 2), we can aim for (3, 4) or (1, 6).\n\nIf we need to circle back for (4, 0) later, we can, but prioritizing the less restrictive movement and denser cluster is key.\n\n**Selected Move:** UP\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue clearing the local dense apple cluster: (4, 2), then (3, 2). After that, assess if (4, 0) is safe to grab or if we should continue moving up towards (3, 4) and (1, 6). We need to maintain higher average Y coordinate to keep options open.\n\nUP",

RIGHT to (8, 2): Empty cell - SAFE\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nComparing options for optimal apple collection:\n- DOWN to (7, 1): Next turn can reach (7, 0) apple in 1 move. From there, (8, 0) apple is adjacent. Then continue up right edge: (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 4), (7, 8). This path collects 9 apples efficiently.\n- UP to (7, 3): Next turn can reach (7, 4) apple in 1 move. Good for the upper right cluster but requires longer travel to reach (7, 0) and (8, 0) apples.\n- RIGHT to (8, 2): Next turn can reach (9, 2) apple in 1 move. Positions well for right edge but slightly less efficient overall than DOWN path.\n\nThe DOWN path is most efficient - collecting apples at (7, 0) and (8, 0) quickly before working up the right edge. Enemy snake is on the left side at (4, 1) and poses no threat to the right side apples.\n\nStrategy: Go down to (7, 1), then (7, 0) for an apple, (8, 0) for another apple, then up the right edge collecting (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 4), and (7, 8) apples in sequence.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Enemy Snake (H0 at (7, 1)) Movement:**\n\nH0's neck is (7, 2).\nH0 is near apples (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 2), (7, 4).\nSafe moves for H0:\n*   UP to (7, 2) (Hits body B0, neck) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (7, 0) (Apple A) -> YES (Most likely move).\n*   LEFT to (6, 1) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 1) (Empty) -> YES.\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (7, 0), it collects an apple and its head is now (7, 0).\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (6, 1), it maneuvers along the bottom.\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (8, 1), it targets (8, 0).\n\nH0 is not currently a threat to H1. H1 is securing space in the (3, 4) quadrant.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and LEFT:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 2) (Apple):**\n    *   This is the intended move based on optimizing apple collection in this cluster.\n    *   New Head: (3, 2). Length increases to 16.\n    *   From (3, 2), future safe moves: UP to (3, 3) (Empty), DOWN to (3, 1) (Body, T), LEFT to (2, 2) (Empty), RIGHT to (4, 2) (Body, T).\n    *   Opens up movement towards (3, 4) (Apple) via (3, 3) or towards the left side (1, 6). Going UP to (3, 3) followed by UP to (3, 4) is a great path.\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 3) (Empty):**\n    *   Moves away from the immediate apple (3, 2).\n    *   New Head: (4, 3).\n    *   From (4, 3), future safe moves: UP to (4, 4) (Apple (4, 5) nearby), DOWN to (4, 2) (Body, T), LEFT to (3, 3) (Empty), RIGHT to (5, 3) (Body, T).\n    *   This is safe, but delays collecting (3, 2) and increases the chances that other segments might block us, or that we miss the opportunity to consolidate the local cluster.\n\nThe priority is to execute the cluster sweep strategy: (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 4). Moving LEFT to (3, 2) is the direct path for the next apple, increasing our lead and minimizing restrictive movement.\n\n**Selected Move:** LEFT\n\n**Long-term Plan:** After eating (3, 2), move UP to (3, 3), then UP to (3, 4) (Apple), securing the third apple in this local quadrant. This keeps us in the central-left area, potentially allowing us to target (4, 5) or (1, 6) next.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Enemy Snake Movement (H0 at (7, 0)):**\n\nH0's neck is (7, 1).\nH0 is near apples (8, 0), (4, 0).\nSafe moves for H0:\n*   UP to (7, 1) (Hits body B0, neck) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (7, -1) (Off board) -> NO.\n*   LEFT to (6, 0) (Empty) -> YES.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 0) (Apple A) -> YES (Likely move, continues eating low apples).\n\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0), it eats an apple. If H0 moves LEFT to (6, 0), it might try to target (4, 0). H0 is still far away from H1.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and LEFT:**\n\nMy planned strategy was to follow the cluster: (4, 2) -> (3, 2) (EAT) -> (3, 4) (EAT).\nTo reach (3, 4), I need to move UP to (3, 3) first.\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 3) (Empty):**\n    *   New Head: (3, 3).\n    *   This sets me up perfectly for the next turn: moving UP to (3, 4) and eating the apple there.\n    *   From (3, 3), safe moves next turn: UP (to 3, 4, apple A), LEFT (to 2, 3), RIGHT (to 4, 3, empty). DOWN is unsafe (3, 2 is body). This path is optimal.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 2) (Empty):**\n    *   New Head: (2, 2).\n    *   This leads me away from the immediate (3, 4) apple cluster and towards the long body segments on the left.\n    *   From (2, 2), moves: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1, empty), LEFT (1, 2, body T), RIGHT (3, 2, body T).\n    *   While safe, it breaks the immediate apple collection momentum.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP to (3, 3) maintains the ideal path to the next apple at (3, 4) and maximizes apple collection efficiency in this region. Given H0 is busy on the bottom edge, this move is safe and aggressive.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Turn 24 (Current): Move UP to (3, 3).\n2. Turn 25: Move UP to (3, 4) (Apple).\n3. Turn 26: Assess targets, likely (4, 5) or (1, 6).\n\nUP",

Evaluate Available Apples and Target Selection:**\n\nH1 is at (3, 4).\n*   (4, 5): 2 moves (RIGHT, UP) or (UP, RIGHT). Very close.\n*   (1, 6): 4 moves (LEFT, UP, UP, UP) or similar.\n*   (4, 8): 4 moves (UP, UP, UP, RIGHT) or similar.\n\nThe apple at (4, 5) is the most immediate and reachable.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake Movement (H0 at (9, 0)):**\n\nH0's neck is (8, 0).\nH0 is trapped in the bottom right corner with many body segments around it: (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2).\nPotential moves for H0:\n*   UP to (9, 1) (Empty) -> YES. (Likely target: (9, 2) A, or moving up the wall to the cluster near column 9).\n*   DOWN to (9, -1) (Off board) -> NO.\n*   LEFT to (8, 0) (Neck) -> NO.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 0) (Off board) -> NO.\nH0 is forced to move UP to (9, 1). This keeps it far away from H1 for now.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for H1:**\n\nSince the target (4, 5) is two moves away, I should start maneuvering towards it.\n\n*   Move RIGHT to (4, 4). This sets me up perfectly for UP to (4, 5) next turn, where I will eat the apple.\n*   Moving UP to (3, 5) is also safe, but slightly less direct to (4, 5), requiring a RIGHT move after. (3, 5) -> (4, 5).\n*   (3, 4) -> (4, 4) [RIGHT] -> (4, 5) [UP] (Eats apple)\n*   (3, 4) -> (3, 5) [UP] -> (4, 5) [RIGHT] (Eats apple)\n\nBoth sequences are essentially equivalent in terms of safety and outcome. I will choose RIGHT, as it moves me away from the wall of my own body (segments at (3, 3), (3, 2), etc.) and towards the center/right side where more apples are clustered.\n\n**Collision Check (Self and Enemy):**\nNo immediate collision with H0 is possible as H0 is moving UP at (9, 1).\nMy move RIGHT to (4, 4) is safe from my own body.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Turn 26 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 4), setting up for (4, 5) apple.\n2. Turn 27: Move UP to (4, 5) (Apple).\n3. Turn 28: Target the cluster of apples above (4, 5), such as (4, 8) or (6, 8), or potentially (7, 4) if maneuvering takes me there.\n\nRIGHT",

Map shows 'T' at (5, 5). **Collision!** |\n\n*Double-checking (5, 5):* Snake 0's body segments are: [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)].\nThe board shows 'T' at (5, 5) - this must be a rendering error or an implicit segment I am not tracking, or maybe it's the tail of H0 which is currently (5, 6) but is about to move. Let's rely on the board state. The board shows:\n`5 . . . . 1 . T . . A`\nThe 'T' is at (6, 5). (5, 5) is empty space ('.') on the board visualization.\n\nLet's re-read the board state description:\n`5 . . . . 1 . T . . A`\n(4, 5) is '1'. (5, 5) is '.'. (6, 5) is 'T'.\n**Correction:** Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) is safe!\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Target Apple Cluster:** The closest and most accessible apple is (4, 8), which is two steps up. There's also (3, 7) nearby. The area above is rich in apples: (0, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (3, 9).\n    *   (4, 8) is 3 steps away (via UP, UP, UP).\n    *   (3, 7) is 3 steps away (via LEFT, UP, UP).\n    *   (1, 6) is 3 steps away (via LEFT, UP, UP).\n\n*   **UP to (4, 6):** This directly progresses toward (4, 8). It keeps the snake centrally located and allows access to the dense apple clusters.\n    *   Future options from (4, 6): UP (4, 7), LEFT (3, 6), RIGHT (5, 6).\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5):** This moves toward the left side, which is slightly more constrained by my own body, but opens access to (3, 7).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 5):** This moves toward H0's territory. H0's body segment at (6, 5) and (6, 6) is close. If I move right, H0 might block me or threaten a collision if it decides to move LEFT or DOWN.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake Movement (H0 at (9, 2)):**\n\nH0's neck is (9, 1).\n\nPotential moves for H0:\n*   UP to (9, 3) (empty).\n*   DOWN to (9, 1) (Neck) -> NO.\n*   LEFT to (8, 2) (Body T). (8, 2) is part of my body map (8, 0 is H0's body). Checking map: (8, 2) is empty (.). Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 2) (Wall) -> NO.\n\nH0 has no immediate apple target reachable in one move. H0 will likely move toward (9, 5), (9, 6), or (9, 7) (all high up). Moving UP to (9, 3) seems most natural, or maybe LEFT to (8, 2) to move around its own corner. Since H1 is far away, we only need to worry about H0's body segment at (6, 5) and (6, 6). Moving UP keeps H1 away from H0's long vertical tail segments (6, 5) and (5, 6).\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nMoving UP to (4, 6) is the most strategic move. It is safe, maintains central control, and sets up a clear path for the valuable apple at (4, 8) and the surrounding high-y apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Turn 28 (Current): Move UP to (4, 6).\n2. Turn 29: Move UP to (4, 7).\n3. Turn 30: Move UP to (4, 8) (Eat apple).\n\nUP",

Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (4, 6)):**\n\nMy neck is (4, 5).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Safe? | Content | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------: | :---: | :------ | :---- |\n| UP   | (4, 7)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) | Direct path to apple (4, 8). |\n| DOWN | (4, 5)        | Hits neck (T)   | NO    | Neck (T) | |\n| LEFT | (3, 6)        | No collision.   | YES   | Empty (.) | Leads toward (3, 7) or (1, 6). |\n| RIGHT| (5, 6)        | No collision.   | YES   | Enemy Body (T) | (5, 6) is empty space (.), but (6, 6) is H0's body. **Correction:** (5, 6) is currently T (Body of H0). Checking H0 body list: (6, 6) is the tail, so (5, 6) might be the new tail position if H0 moved right. Wait, H0's body list for the current turn *ends* at (0, 3). The board shows 'T' at (5, 6) and (6, 6). Relying on the board visualization: (5, 6) is rendered as 'T'. **Collision!** |\n\nLet's carefully verify board:\n`6 . A . . 1 . T . A A`\n(4, 6) is '1'. (5, 6) is '.'. (6, 6) is 'T'.\n**Re-Correction:** (5, 6) is CLEAR ('.'). Moving RIGHT is safe!\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nWe are aiming for the dense cluster of apples in the top-middle/top-left: (4, 8), (3, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (0, 8), (1, 6). (4, 8) is the easiest immediate apple.\n\n*   **UP to (4, 7):** Best choice. Keeps us on the direct path to (4, 8) and centrally located.\n    *   Turn 30 objective: Move UP to (4, 8) (Eat apple).\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Good choice. Opens up access to (3, 7) (2 steps) or (1, 6) (2 steps). However, H0 is moving up and right might put pressure on that area later if we stay to the left.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe, but begins moving toward the right side where H0 is dominant. H0 is at (9, 3). While H0 is currently far, moving right brings us closer to H0's body chain: (6, 6), and the right side apples are also highly contested by H0 (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake Movement (H0 at (9, 3)):**\n\nH0 is likely moving up toward the cluster (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7).\n\nPotential moves for H0:\n*   UP to (9, 4) (Empty). Likely move.\n*   LEFT to (8, 3) (Empty). Leads toward (8, 6), (8, 7).\n*   RIGHT to (10, 3) (Wall) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (9, 2) (Neck) -> NO.\n\nH1 (4, 6) is far from H0 (9, 3), so head-on collision is not a threat. We need to ensure H0 doesn't cut off our path to apples or trap us. Since H1 is focused on (4, 8), movement by H0 does not directly interfere.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nMoving UP to (4, 7) continues the most efficient route to the closest major apple (4, 8) while maintaining safety and central control.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Turn 29 (Current): Move UP to (4, 7).\n2. Turn 30: Move UP to (4, 8) (Eat apple).\n3. Turn 31: Re-evaluate based on new body configuration. Potential targets: (3, 7) or (6, 8).\n\nUP",

Secondary target. |\n| RIGHT| (5, 7)        | No collision.   | Empty (.) | YES   | Moves toward (6, 8) potentially. |\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves (Prioritizing Apples and Maneuverability):**\n\nH1 is currently surrounded by two apples: (4, 8) (UP) and (3, 7) (LEFT).\n\n*   **UP to (4, 8):** Eats an apple. This is the most straightforward move, pushing H1 into the top row, which has several apples.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Eats an apple. This positions H1 slightly more to the left, which is also helpful for targets like (0, 8) and (3, 9).\n\n**3. Comparison UP vs. LEFT:**\n\nBoth moves collect an apple immediately, increasing our length and extending our lead (17 vs 14 apples).\n\n*   If we go **UP to (4, 8)**, our next available safe spots are (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8). (4, 9) leads to (3, 9) or (0, 8), and (3, 8) leads to (3, 7) (if not taken by an enemy).\n*   If we go **LEFT to (3, 7)**, our next available safe spots are (3, 8) (leads toward (3, 9)), (2, 7), (4, 7) (neck). (3, 8) is a good spot leading toward (3, 9) and other top-row apples.\n\nThe immediate objective is the same: collect an apple. We need to consider H0's position.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy Snake Movement (H0 at (9, 4)):**\n\nH0 is at (9, 4), and is likely making a bid for the right-side cluster: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7).\n\nPotential moves for H0:\n*   UP to (9, 5) (Apple). Most likely move.\n*   LEFT to (8, 4) (Empty). Leads toward (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 4).\n*   RIGHT to (10, 4) (Wall) -> NO.\n*   DOWN to (9, 3) (Neck) -> NO.\n\nA head-on collision is impossible this turn. H0 is nowhere near (3, 7) or (4, 8).\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are excellent moves.\n*   Target (4, 8) (UP) keeps us highly central and in a position to easily sweep the top row (0, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8) and (3, 9).\n*   Target (3, 7) (LEFT) pushes us more to the left, potentially making it harder to contest the central top apples, but easier to get (0, 8) and (1, 6).\n\nSince (4, 8) is slightly more central and keeps options open towards the clusters on both sides (e.g., (6, 8)), I will choose UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Turn 30: Move UP to (4, 8) (Eat apple).\n2. Turn 31: If (3, 7) is still available, consider moving LEFT to (3, 8) then LEFT to (2, 8) or continue exploiting the top row/center area (e.g., RIGHT to (5, 8), then to (6, 8)). Given H0 is likely eating on the right, keeping H1 central is key.\n\nUP",

(3, 8) is currently occupied by an Apple (A).\n\n    *Wait, checking the board state again. Q: Is (3, 8) an apple?*\n    The provided board state:\n    `9 . . . A . . . . . .`\n    `8 A . A . 1 .

(8, 8) is A.\n    Coordinates: (3, 8) is listed as 'A' in the board state visualization.\n    *Correction:* The list of apples states: (0, 8), (2, 8) are apples. The visualization *shows* (2, 8) as 'A' and (3, 8) as '.'.\n    Let's rely on the list of apples and the board visualization provided, which should match.\n    Apples at: (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 0), (8, 6), (7, 4), (9, 6), (7, 8), (8, 7), **(0, 8)**, **(6, 8)**, **(3, 9)**, (6, 1), **(3, 7)**, (5, 5), **(2, 8)**.\n\n    Checking Row 8:\n    (0, 8) = A\n    (1, 8) = .\n    (2, 8) = A\n    (3, 8) = .

Leads toward (6, 8) (Apple) and (7, 8) (Apple). Also adjacent to (5, 9) (empty) which is a long wall move.\n\n**3. Comparison and Strategy:**\n\nWe have a cluster of apples to the LEFT/UP and another to the RIGHT. H0 is extremely far away, working the far right column (likely moving to (9, 6) or (8, 5)). We have time to collect multiple apples safely.\n\n*   If we go **LEFT (3, 8)**: Next turn we can target (2, 8) (Apple) or (3, 9) (Apple).\n*   If we go **UP (4, 9)**: Next turn we can target (3, 9) (Apple) or (4, 8) (Neck, illegal) or (5, 9).\n\nThe LEFT path (towards 3, 8) seems to offer slightly better immediate options:\n1. T31: LEFT to (3, 8).\n2. T32: UP to (3, 9) (A) OR LEFT to (2, 8) (A). Both are great.\n\nThe RIGHT path (towards 5, 8):\n1. T31: RIGHT to (5, 8).\n2. T32: RIGHT to (6, 8) (A). This is also excellent.\n\nSince we are fairly central, contesting the cluster (6, 8), (7, 8) might be more important, as H0 could potentially circle back towards (8, 7) or (8, 6). However, H0 is currently at (9, 5) and busy with (9, 6), (9, 7).\n\nLet's prioritize the direction that allows us to eat soonest and keep maneuverability. Both RIGHT and LEFT lead to an apple in 1 or 2 more turns.\n\nIf we go RIGHT:\nT31: (5, 8)\nT32: (6, 8) (Apple)\n\nIf we go LEFT:\nT31: (3, 8)\nT32: (2, 8) (Apple)\n\nBoth are equally good in terms of immediate reward. Given the current snake shape, moving LEFT keeps the snake body slightly more coiled which might be slightly safer, although not strictly necessary here. (3, 8) also opens up the area around the starting point of the snake, simplifying the search for the tail exit eventually.\n\nLet's choose **LEFT** to secure the (3, 9) / (2, 8) apples before moving RIGHT again.\n\n**4. Collision Check (Crucial for multi-turn planning):**\n\nH0 is at (9, 5).\nIf H0 moves UP: (9, 6) (Apple).\nIf H0 moves LEFT: (8, 5) (Empty; leads to (8, 6), (8, 7)).\n\nThere is no risk of collision.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move LEFT to (3, 8) to target the (2, 8) apple or the (3, 9) apple next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T32 onwards):**\n1. T31: LEFT to (3, 8).\n2. T32: Target (2, 8) (Apple) or (3, 9) (Apple). If (2, 8) is taken, go UP to (3, 9).\n3. T33: Based on remaining apples, sweep towards (0, 8) or sweep back to (6, 8) / (7, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Let's use the explicit coordinate lists for collision checking.)*\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (3, 8)):**\n\nMy neck is (4, 8).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (3, 9)        | Apple (A) | No collision.   | YES   | EATS! |\n| DOWN | (3, 7)        | Apple (A) | No collision.   | YES   | EATS! |\n| LEFT | (2, 8)        | Apple (A) | No collision.   | YES   | EATS! |\n| RIGHT| (4, 8)        | Neck (T) | Hits self.      | NO    | |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. All three options result in eating an apple and growing immediately!\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe and Apple-Eating Moves:**\n\nWe have an incredible choice this turn. We can move to (3, 9), (3, 7), or (2, 8). All three are apples.\n\n*   **Strategy: Maximize future apple collection and prevent enemy access.**\n\nH0 is clearing the top right corner: (9, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6). H0 is still far away from our current area (left side, middle-to-top).\n\nWe should choose the move that sets us up best for the next subsequent apple cluster.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (3, 9) (A)**\n    *   Eats immediately.\n    *   Next turn H1 is at (3, 9).\n    *   Next safe/apple targets: (2, 9) (Empty), (4, 9) (Empty), (3, 8) (now empty, was head). Requires moving away from the remaining adjacent apples at (3, 7) and (2, 8). If we go UP, we might have to waste a move coming back DOWN or going to the left wall.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (3, 7) (A)**\n    *   Eats immediately.\n    *   Next turn H1 is at (3, 7).\n    *   Next safe/apple targets: (4, 7) (Body T - NO), (2, 7) (Empty), (3, 6) (Empty).\n    *   This move takes us towards the center of the board, potentially complicating later movement due to our longer body segments at (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (2, 8) (A)**\n    *   Eats immediately.\n    *   Next turn H1 is at (2, 8).\n    *   Next safe/apple targets: (1, 8) (Empty), (2, 9) (Empty, near (3, 9) Apple), (2, 7) (Empty), (3, 8) (now empty).\n    *   This is the most strategic move because it places us in a good position to continue sweeping the left side (targeting (0, 8) potentially) or immediately grabbing (3, 9) next turn. More importantly, it is adjacent to the (0, 8) apple and keeps the area around (4, 8) (our long body) open for maneuverability if needed.\n\n**Detailed Look at LEFT:**\n1. T32: Move LEFT to (2, 8) [EAT]. H1 at (2, 8).\n2. T33 potential moves:\n   *   UP to (2, 9) (Empty, path to (3, 9) [A]).\n   *   DOWN to (2, 7) (Empty).\n   *   LEFT to (1, 8) (Empty, path to (0, 8) [A]).\n   *   RIGHT to (3, 8) (Empty, path to (3, 9) [A] or (3, 7) [A]).\n\nThis option maintains maximum flexibility and allows us to pursue two more apples immediately: (3, 9) and (0, 8).\n\nLet's prioritize sweeping the current local cluster effectively.\n\nIf we go LEFT (2, 8) (A):\nNext turn, we can go RIGHT to (3, 8) and UP to (3, 9) (A). Sequence: (3, 8) -> (2, 8) A -> (3, 8) E -> (3, 9) A. Total 2 apples in 2 turns while only moving 3 cells. (Note: Wait, after eating at (2, 8), the cell (3, 8) is empty and (3, 9) is still an apple. So T33: Move UP/RIGHT to (3, 9) is impossible from (2, 8). We can go RIGHT to (3, 8) (Empty), then UP to (3, 9) (A) on T34).\n\nIf we go UP (3, 9) (A):\nNext turn, we are at (3, 9). We need to come back down.\nT33: DOWN to (3, 8) (E).\nT34: LEFT to (2, 8) (A) OR DOWN to (3, 7) (A).\nThis seems like a slightly less direct path to the other apples.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2, 8): We control the left column well and are perfectly positioned to grab (0, 8) or (3, 9) next. Let's aim to get the (0, 8) as it is on the edge and potentially harder to reach later if we move too far right.\n\nT32: LEFT to (2, 8) [A].\nT33: LEFT to (1, 8) (E).\nT34: LEFT to (0, 8) [A]. (3 apples in 3 turns).\n\nAlternatively:\nT32: LEFT to (2, 8) [A].\nT33: RIGHT to (3, 8) (E).\nT34: UP to (3, 9) [A]. (2 apples in 2 turns, 2 more moves). Wait, T33 move RIGHT to (3, 8) costs 1 move, then T34 UP to (3, 9) costs another. Total 2 moves for 1 apple.\n\nThe path sweeping towards (0, 8) and (1, 6) seems strong. Let's commit to the left-side sweep.\n\n**Final Decision:** Choose LEFT to (2, 8). This eats an apple immediately and places us optimally to grab (0, 8) next.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** Target (0, 8) next, then assess if sweeping down to (1, 6) or back right to (3, 7) is better. Snake 0 is still far away in the top right corner.\n\nLEFT",

Since we ate an apple, (3, 8) is still a body segment.) Let's re-verify the body list. Head is (2, 8). Neck is (3, 8). **Moving RIGHT is unsafe, collision with self.** |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe rationale from T32 suggested moving LEFT towards (0, 8).\n\n*   **Target (0, 8) Apple:**\n    *   Currently at (2, 8).\n    *   Move LEFT to (1, 8) (Empty).\n    *   Next turn: Move LEFT to (0, 8) (Apple). (2 moves for 1 apple).\n\n*   **Target (3, 9) Apple:**\n    *   Currently at (2, 8).\n    *   Move UP to (2, 9) (Empty).\n    *   Next turn: Move RIGHT to (3, 9) (Apple). (2 moves for 1 apple).\n\n*   **Target (3, 7) Apple:**\n    *   Currently at (2, 8).\n    *   Move DOWN to (2, 7) (Empty).\n    *   Next turn: Move RIGHT to (3, 7) (Apple). (2 moves for 1 apple).\n\nAll three immediate apples (besides the neighboring (2, 8) we just ate) require 2 moves to reach. We need to choose the path that maximizes future flexibility or control.\n\n**Checking the moves against the enemy (H0 at (8, 6)):**\nH0 is far away and focused on the top right area (likely moving UP to (8, 7) A or RIGHT to (9, 6) T). No immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Comparing UP, DOWN, and LEFT:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (1, 8):** This commits us to the left wall. After eating (0, 8) at T34, we are at the very corner. We can then proceed down towards (0, 7) or (1, 6) A. This is a very clean sweep of the corner apples.\n2. **UP to (2, 9):** This positions us for (3, 9) A. After eating (3, 9), we are on the top edge and can move towards (4, 9) A (not an apple), or back down towards the middle. It's a fine choice but leaves the corner (0, 8) exposed.\n3. **DOWN to (2, 7):** This brings us closer to the dense body mass on row 7 and 6, and the apple at (3, 7). This area might get congested as we try to maneuver past our own segments: (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n\nThe LEFT move seems the safest and most efficient for clearing the boundary apples. We maximize territory control and keep the body congestion to our right.\n\n**Chosen Plan: Sweep the left wall**\nT33: Move LEFT to (1, 8).\nT34: Move LEFT to (0, 8) [EAT].\nT35: Move DOWN to (0, 7) (Empty).\nT36: Move RIGHT to (1, 7) or DOWN to (0, 6). If we move right, we can target (1, 6) A.\n\nThe move LEFT is the realization of the planned sweep strategy.\n\nLEFT",

(Moved LEFT from (2, 8)).\n    *   Body (L=20): [(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]. Apples Collected: 19.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (8, 7). (Length 19). Apple count 18. (Must have moved UP from (8, 6) or RIGHT from (7, 7). Looking at the score difference, H0 likely just ate an apple at (8, 7) or (9, 7)). Given the score update, H0 moved UP and ate the apple previously at (8, 7) or it moved RIGHT and ate (9, 7). Let's check the apple list. `Apples at: (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8), (0, 8), (6, 8), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 9), (8, 8), (1, 5)`. The apple (8, 7) is not in the list, but (9, 7) is. The body list shows H0's head at (8, 7), with neck at (8, 6). Therefore, H0 moved UP from (8, 6) to (8, 7). It did NOT eat an apple this turn, the score difference is 1, meaning the enemy ate an apple on T33. Re-reading the body list, H0 is at (8, 7) and the neck is (8, 6). The enemy must have moved UP from (8, 6) to (8, 7). If it ate on T33, the score would be 18.\n\n    *   *Self-Correction on Enemy Score/Movement:* H0 Head (8, 7). H0 Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), ...]. H0 moved UP from (8, 6). The score is 18. If it had eaten an apple at (8, 7), the apple list would be updated, but the provided apple list *still shows* (8, 8) and (7, 8). Crucially, the apple list for T34 shows 15 apples. The list for T33 had 15 apples. I must assume the enemy did NOT eat an apple on T33, and the apple at (8, 7) was already consumed prior to T33, or that Snake #0's score of 18 is from eating before T34. Since (8, 7) is not an apple location and H0 arrived there from (8, 6), no apple was consumed this turn.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15):** (9, 7), (1, 6), (4, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8), **(0, 8)**, (6, 8), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 9), (8, 8), (1, 5).\n\n**Board State (H1 at (1, 8), H0 at (8, 7)):**\n 9 . . .

Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 8)):**\n\nMy neck is (2, 8).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (1, 9)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | |\n| DOWN | (1, 7)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | |\n| LEFT | (0, 8)        | Apple (A)| **EAT**. No collision.| YES   | Primary target. |\n| RIGHT| (2, 8)        | Neck (T)| Hitting self.   | NO    |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe current priority, continuing the T33 plan, is to eat the apple at (0, 8).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 8):** This is an immediate apple capture. Length increases. This is the optimal move.\n\n**Future Planning (After EAT at (0, 8)):**\n\nH1 will be at (0, 8).\nNext optimal target is (1, 6) or (3, 7).\nIf we move LEFT and eat the apple:\nT35: H1 at (0, 8). Safe moves: UP (0, 9), DOWN (0, 7), RIGHT (1, 8, which is now the neck).\n1. DOWN to (0, 7) (Empty)\n2. DOWN to (0, 6) (Empty, potentially).\n3. RIGHT and DOWN to (1, 6) A.\n\nThis sets up a sweep along the left wall.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration (H0 at (8, 7)):**\nH0 is near (9, 7) A, (7, 8) A, and (8, 8) A.\nPossible moves for H0:\n1. UP to (8, 8) (Apple, EAT). This is highly likely.\n2. RIGHT to (9, 7) (Apple, EAT). Also highly likely.\n3. LEFT to (7, 7) (Empty. Safe).\n4. DOWN to (8, 6) (Neck, unsafe).\n\nH0 is far from H1, so no head-on conflict. We secure the apple at (0, 8).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move LEFT to immediately capture the apple at (0, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves (Prioritizing Apples and Open Space):**\n\nCurrent H1 position (0, 8).\nNearest apples: (1, 6), (1, 5). (Also (3, 7) and (3, 9) nearby).\n\n*   **Move UP to (0, 9):** Moves H1 to the top edge. Safe. Opens up access to (3, 9) A (4 spaces away).\n    *   If UP: (0, 9). Next moves: RIGHT (1, 9) or DOWN (0, 8) (now body). This is restrictive, but potentially useful for reaching (3, 9).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 7):** Moves H1 along the left wall. Safe. Sets up H1 to pursue (1, 6) A or (1, 5) A.\n    *   If DOWN: (0, 7). Next moves: RIGHT (1, 7) or DOWN (0, 6). This provides good maneuverability along the wall. (1, 6) is only 2 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN) or (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\nMoving DOWN seems better as it allows H1 to continue the sweep down the left side, targeting (1, 6) and (1, 5), which are relatively uncontested. Moving UP takes H1 away from immediate targets and forces it toward the clustered upper center apples which are closer to the enemy's territory (although H0 is far right).\n\n**3. Enemy Movement Consideration (H0 at (8, 8)):**\n\nH0's neck is (8, 7). H0 is near (7, 8) A, (6, 8) A, (9, 7) A.\n\nPossible moves for H0:\n1. UP to (8, 9) (Empty).\n2. RIGHT to (9, 8) (Empty).\n3. LEFT to (7, 8) (Apple, EAT). HIGHLY LIKELY.\n4. DOWN to (8, 7) (Neck. Unsafe).\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (7, 8) and eats, it secures another apple and continues moving west towards the cluster around (6, 8).\n\nSince H0 is far, its movement does not affect my safety or immediate apple choice.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nI will move DOWN to (0, 7) to position myself for the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue sweeping apples down the left perimeter: (1, 6), (1, 5), then potentially (4, 0). If the center opens up, exploit it.\n\nDOWN",

Which one positions me better afterward?\n\n1. If RIGHT to (1, 7): Next turn, I move DOWN to (1, 6) (EAT A). Now H1 is at (1, 6).\n2. If DOWN to (0, 6): Next turn, I move RIGHT to (1, 6) (EAT A). Now H1 is at (1, 6).\n\nThey both lead to the same outcome (eating A at (1, 6) next turn, ending up at (1, 6)). However, moving RIGHT (1, 7) keeps me slightly closer to the horizontal path and the cluster of apples around the center column (e.g., (3, 7), (5, 5)). Moving DOWN (0, 6) keeps me pinned to the left wall.\n\nLet's check for immediate conflict with H0.\nH0 is at (7, 8). H0 is far away and likely moving toward (6, 8) A or (9, 7) A. My move is safe from H0 collision.\n\n**Decision:** Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) is preferred slightly over moving DOWN to (0, 6) because it maintains a more central position for subsequent moves toward (3, 7) or the cluster below.\n\n**3. Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (1, 7).\n2. Move DOWN to (1, 6) to eat the apple.\n3. Then move towards (1, 5) (apple) or continue right towards (3, 7) (apple). Since (1, 5) is 1 move down from (1, 6), it's the obvious next target. Sweep down the left margin.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   Eats an apple! Score increases, length increases. This is the primary objective.\n    *   H1 moves away from H0, minimizing immediate risk.\n    *   Next turn H1 will be at (1, 6). Safe options: UP (1, 7 - empty), DOWN (1, 5 - APPLE!), LEFT (0, 6 - empty), RIGHT (2, 6 - empty). This move sets up eating (1, 5) next turn.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   Doesn't eat an apple.\n    *   Next turn H1 would still need to move toward apples. (1, 6) would be accessible via DOWN+LEFT (2 moves).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (1, 6) is the optimal move as it scores an apple immediately and sets up a clear path to the next apple at (1, 5).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (6, 8)):**\nH0 is at (6, 8). Its body is at (7, 8).\nH0's options: UP (6, 9 - Empty), DOWN (6, 7 - Empty), LEFT (5, 8 - Empty), RIGHT (7, 8 - Body NO).\nSince the apple (3, 9) is high, H0 might go UP or LEFT toward the center top. Given H0's current position, it poses no immediate threat to H1 at (1, 7) or (1, 6).\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Now (T37): Move DOWN to (1, 6) (Eat A).\n2. T38: Move DOWN to (1, 5) (Eat A).\n3. T39: From (1, 5), move toward the next closest apple, (2, 3) or (3, 7). Sweeping right (2, 5) then (3, 5) seems viable.\n\nDOWN",

Moves H1 towards the dense body area (3, 7) has an apple, but (3, 6) is empty / (4, 6) is body.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 8)):**\nH0 is at (5, 8). Its neck is (6, 8).\nH0 is near apples (3, 9), (4, 9), and (5, 6), (5, 5).\nH0 safe options: UP (5, 9 - Empty), DOWN (5, 7 - Empty), LEFT (4, 8 - Body NO), RIGHT (6, 8 - Body NO, neck).\nWait, H0's current body is: `[(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), ...]`\nH0 moved from (6, 8) to (5, 8). H0's neck is now (6, 8).\nH0 safe options: UP (5, 9 - $A$), DOWN (5, 7 - empty), LEFT (4, 8 - My Body T).\nH0 cannot go LEFT (4, 8) as it is dangerous (my body).\nH0 will likely go UP to (5, 9) (no apple there, $A$ is (4, 9) or (3, 9)), or DOWN to (5, 7).\n(5, 9) is empty. (4, 9) is an apple. (3, 9) is an apple.\nIf H0 goes UP to (5, 9), it is positioned well for (4, 9).\nIf H0 goes DOWN to (5, 7), it starts moving away from the top wall.\n\nRegardless of H0's move, H1 moving DOWN to (1, 5) is safe and guarantees an apple, and this area is far from H0.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Now (T38): Move DOWN to (1, 5) (Eat A).\n2. T39: From (1, 5), move toward the next closest apple. (2, 3) is 3 moves away (R D D), (3, 7) is 3-4 moves away. (2, 3) seems like a good target if the path is clear. (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 5) are all safe, allowing flexibility. Given the immediate adjacency of (1, 5) to the body segment (1, 4) is empty, (2, 5) is empty.\n\nDOWN is the clear optimal choice.\n\nDOWN",

It gets me 2 apples in 3 turns compared to 1 apple\n2. It keeps my future options open with multiple safe directions available\n3. The enemy snake is at (1, 6) in the left part of the board, so we're not competing for these central apples\n4. After eating at (5, 5), I can continue to (7, 5) for a third apple\n\nStrategy: Go DOWN toward (5, 7), continue DOWN to eat apples at (5, 6) and (5, 5), then maneuver RIGHT toward (7, 5) for more apples while maintaining flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

(Just ate the apple at (1, 5) on T38).\n    *   Length: 23.\n    *   Apples Collected: 22.\n    *   Neck: (1, 6).\n    *   Tail will move from (0, 0) to (1, 0) if I move away from the apple, but since I ate, the tail remains at (0, 0). (The board state shows (0, 0) as 'T', so the body list confirms (0, 0) is the tail, and it will remain there if I move).\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (5, 7). (Moved from (5, 8)).\n    *   Length: 22.\n    *   Apples Collected: 21.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14):** (9, 7), (4, 0), (7, 4), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 9), (6, 0), (7, 5), (2, 3), (7, 3), (1, 9), (6, 9).\n    *   Nearest apples to H1 (1, 5):\n        1. (2, 3) - Manhattan distance 3 (R D D or R R D L? No, R D D is the best path if clear).\n        2. (4, 0) - Manhattan distance 5 (D D R R R).\n        3. (3, 7) - Manhattan distance 4 (R U U R).\n        4. (5, 5) - Manhattan distance 4 (R R R R). (5, 6) is similar.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 5)):**\n\nMy position: (1, 5).

Evaluate Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 7)):**\n\nH0 at (5, 7). Neck: (5, 8).\nH0 is near apples (5, 6) (1 step), (5, 5) (2 steps), (3, 7) (2 steps), (7, 5) (3 steps).\nH0 safe options:\n*   UP (5, 8): Body (Neck). NO.\n*   DOWN (5, 6): Apple A. YES. (Optimal move for H0).\n*   LEFT (4, 7): My Body T. NO.\n*   RIGHT (6, 7): Empty. YES.\n\n*Prediction for H0 (5, 7):* H0 is almost certainly moving DOWN to (5, 6) to eat an apple. (This is 1 move, while other apples are 2 or more away).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for H1 (1, 5):**\n\nWe want to move towards apples while maintaining space and avoiding H0's future path. H0 is far away, so collision is not an immediate concern.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 4):**\n    *   Path towards (2, 3) (A: 2 steps away after moving D), and (4, 0). (1, 4) is currently clear.\n    *   Next potential moves: (1, 3) is empty, (1, 5) is empty, (0, 4) is empty, (2, 4) is empty. Good options.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n    *   Leads towards (2, 3) (A: 2 steps away: D D), or toward (3, 7).\n    *   (2, 5) is currently clear.\n    *   Next potential moves: (2, 4) is empty, (3, 5) is empty.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 5):**\n    *   Moves away from central contested area.\n    *   (0, 5) is clear. Does not immediately target an apple well. (1, 9) is 4 steps away but involves going up the edge.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\n\nThe apple (2, 3) is the closest feasible target.\n*   If I move DOWN to (1, 4), the path to (2, 3) is R U (or R D, but (2, 4) is empty, (3, 4) is my body T).\n    *   From (1, 4): (2, 4) is empty. Then (2, 3) is A. Path: R D (2 steps).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (2, 5), the path to (2, 3) is D D (2 steps).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT set up a 2-step path to apple (2, 3).\n\nThe area around (1, 4), (1, 3) is open. The area around (2, 5), (3, 5) is slightly more constrained by the T-body block (3, 4) than the D path.\n\nLet's look at the density:\n(1, 4) is surrounded by empty space: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4).\n(2, 5) is surrounded by: (1, 5) H1, (2, 6) empty, (3, 5) empty, (2, 4) empty. (3, 4 is T).\n\nMoving DOWN seems slightly safer and keeps my snake body segments (1, 6) and (1, 7) behind me, forming a solid wall while I creep down into the open space. The path D, then R, then D is slightly problematic since the tail is below (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0).\n\nLet's stick to the minimal moves to (2, 3).\nOption A: (1, 5) -> R (2, 5) -> D (2, 4) -> D (2, 3) [A] (3 steps total)\nOption B: (1, 5) -> D (1, 4) -> R (2, 4) -> D (2, 3) [A] (3 steps total)\n\nBoth are equally efficient now. I will choose RIGHT because it positions me more centrally, ready to access apples (3, 7) or (5, 5) later, and avoids hugging the left wall (where my body ends).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 5).\n\nLong-Term Plan for next few turns: Move towards (2, 3). If H0 eats (5, 6), they will be deep in the middle/right side of the board. I must secure the left area apples.\n\nRIGHT",

(Moved right from (1, 5) last turn, presumably *not* eating the apple at (1, 5) on T39, as the game state shows the head at (2, 5) and the body list confirms (1, 5) is now body. The apple list should reflect the apples present before T39 move. Wait, the previous turn rationale confirms I was at (1, 5) and moved RIGHT to (2, 5). The visible board shows (1, 5) is 'T' (my body) and (2, 5) is '1' (my head). This is consistent. The apple I ate on T38 was previously at (2, 5). No, the previous move rationale said I ate the apple at (1, 5) on T38 and then moved right to (2, 5) on T39. My body segment list shows (1, 5) is now body, and (2, 5) is head. This means I did *not* eat an apple on T39, and my length is 24 (Head + 23 body segments). Confirmed: Length 24.\n    *   Neck: (1, 5).\n    *   Tail: (1, 0). (Tail will be (2, 0) if I move away from the current tail, as my body list is [(2, 0), (1, 0)] at the end, meaning (1, 0) is the tail, and it will disappear unless I eat).\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (5, 6). (Moved down from (5, 7) last turn, eating the apple at (5, 6)).\n    *   Neck: (5, 7).\n    *   Length: 23 (Head + 22 body segments).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15):** (9, 7), (4, 0), (7, 4), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (5, 5), (4, 9), (6, 0), (7, 5), (2, 3), (7, 3), (1, 9), (6, 9), (6, 5) (Note: (5, 6) was eaten by H0 and is not in the list).\n\n    *   Nearest apples to H1 (2, 5):\n        1. (2, 3) - Manhattan distance 2 (D D). -> Target!\n        2. (3, 7) - Manhattan distance 3 (R U U).\n        3. (5, 5) - Manhattan distance 3 (R R R).\n        4. (4, 0) - Manhattan distance 7 (D D D L R R D D D D D -> 2R 5D). Actual shortest path uses my body. X distance 2, Y distance 5. 7 steps.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (2, 5)):**\n\nMy position: (2, 5). Neck: (1, 5).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (2, 6)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | |\n| DOWN | (2, 4)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads directly to A(2, 3). |\n| LEFT | (1, 5)        | My Neck | Hitting self (Neck). | NO    | |\n| RIGHT| (3, 5)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads towards A(5, 5). |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 6)):**\n\nH0 at (5, 6). Neck: (5, 7).\nH0 is near apples (5, 5) (1 step), (6, 5) (1 step), (7, 5) (2 steps), (7, 4) (3 steps).\n\nH0 safe options:\n*   UP (5, 7): Body (Neck). NO.\n*   DOWN (5, 5): Apple A. YES. (Optimal move).\n*   LEFT (4, 6): My Body T. NO.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6): 0 (Enemy Head). NO. Wait, board state shows (6, 6) is empty '0'. Hmm. Let's re-read the board state:\n    `5 . T 1 . T A A A . T`\n    H0 is at (5, 6). (6, 6) is '0', which represents Snake #0's head position.\n    Wait, the game state says H0 is at (5, 6).\n    Board state row 6: `. T . . T 0 . . T T`\n    (5, 6) is '0'. (6, 6) is '.' (Empty).\n    If H0 is at (5, 6), then:\n    *   (5, 7) is Neck (T).\n    *   (6, 6) is Empty. YES.\n    *   (5, 5) is Apple A. YES. (Optimal Move 1)\n    *   (4, 6) is My Body T. NO.\n\n*Prediction for H0 (5, 6):* H0 is positioned perfectly to eat (5, 5) (1 step away). H0 could also go RIGHT to (6, 6), which leads to other central apples (6, 5, 7, 5). (6, 5) is 1 step from (6, 6). Since (5, 5) is an immediate apple, they will likely go DOWN.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for H1 (2, 5):**\n\nThe target is A(2, 3). This requires moving DOWN twice.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 4):**\n    *   (2, 4) is currently clear.\n    *   Next turn: Move DOWN to (2, 3) to eat the apple. This is the optimal path for the *nearest* apple.\n    *   This path is safe and efficient.\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 6):**\n    *   Moves away from the nearest apple (2, 3).\n    *   Leads towards (3, 7) (A: 4 steps) or (1, 9) (A: 4 steps).\n    *   Less beneficial than DOWN.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Leads towards A(5, 5) (2 steps away). But H0 is likely eating (5, 5) this turn.\n        *   If H0 moves D to (5, 5), A(5, 5) is gone.\n    *   Leads towards A(3, 7) (3 steps away).\n    *   Risks crossing paths with H0 later.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\n\nMove DOWN to (2, 4). This secures the path to the closest apple (2, 3) in the next turn (T41). This apple is safe from H0, who is focused on the central cluster of apples around (5, 5) and (6, 5).\n\nSince H0 is highly likely to move DOWN to (5, 5) (eating an apple), there is no immediate collision risk.\n\nThe move DOWN to (2, 4) is the best choice for maximizing apple collection efficiency.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for next few turns:**\nT40: Move DOWN to (2, 4).\nT41: Move DOWN to (2, 3) to eat apple A. (My head will be at (2, 3), neck at (2, 4), tail will remain at (1, 0)).\nT42: Target A(3, 7) or A(4, 0). (3, 7) seems more strategic if I move R U U U from (2, 3).\n\nDOWN",

Neck: (2, 5).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (2, 5)        | My Neck | Hitting self (Neck). | NO    | |\n| DOWN | (2, 3)        | Apple A | No collision.   | YES   | Optimal move: Eat apple. |\n| LEFT | (1, 4)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | |\n| RIGHT| (3, 4)        | My Body T | Hitting self.   | NO    |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (2, 4)):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 3):** This is an immediate capture of the nearest apple. Since I am already one apple behind, this is crucial for score parity. This move is perfectly safe, as (2, 3) is an apple, and no other snake is close enough to contest or collide.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 4):** This moves away from the nearest apple and achieves no immediate goal. It is safe but poor strategy.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 5)):**\n\nH0 at (5, 5). Neck: (5, 6). H0 just ate an apple and is centered among many.\n\nH0 safe options:\n*   UP (5, 6): Body (Neck). NO.\n*   DOWN (5, 4): Empty. YES.\n*   LEFT (4, 5): My Body T. NO.\n*   RIGHT (6, 5): Apple A. YES. (Optimal move).\n\n*Prediction for H0 (5, 5):* H0 is highly likely to move RIGHT to (6, 5) to claim another apple immediately.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 3) captures an apple, increases my lead on the scoreboard (or ties it, depending on H0's move), and maintains safety. This is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. T41: Move DOWN to (2, 3) (Eat A).\n2. T42: From (2, 3), target A(3, 7), or A(4, 0) if H0 moves far north/east. A(3, 7) is 4 steps (R U U U). A(4, 0) is 6 steps (R R D D D D). Given the cluster of apples up north ((3, 9), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 9)), moving north looks more promising, especially to clear the block of my body segments (3, 4) and (3, 3). If H0 goes for A(6, 5), they might then go for (7, 5) or (7, 4). My target should be (3, 7) or (3, 9).\n\nDOWN",

Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (2, 3)):**\n\nMy position: (2, 3).

UP is blocked.\n*   (3, 3) is my body. RIGHT (3, 3) is blocked!\n\nThis is a very tricky position.

LEFT is safe.\n\nI have limited movement options: DOWN or LEFT. I cannot immediately move toward the closet apple (2, 6).\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (2, 3)):**\n\nI need to get out of this box and aim for the nearby apples (2, 6) or (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 3):**\n    *   This opens up space and allows me to move towards the northern walls (1, 9) or pivot back towards (2, 6) via (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).\n    *   Next turn (T43) from (1, 3):\n        *   UP (1, 4) - Free.\n        *   DOWN (1, 2) - Free.\n        *   LEFT (0, 3) - Free.\n        *   RIGHT (2, 3) - Neck (NO).\n    *   This is a strong move for maneuverability.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 2):**\n    *   This moves me toward my tail and the crowded southern area (4, 0).\n    *   Next turn (T43) from (2, 2):\n        *   UP (2, 3) - Neck (NO).\n        *   DOWN (2, 1) - Free.\n        *   LEFT (1, 2) - Free.\n        *   RIGHT (3, 2) - Body (T). NO.\n    *   This move significantly limits my options next turn, turning (2, 2) into another choke point, and directs me away from the target rich northern environment.\n\n**Conclusion on H1 movement:** Moving LEFT to (1, 3) provides the best immediate utility by opening up space and allowing for a path northwards to the cluster of apples along Y=6+ and Y=9.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Threat (H0 at (6, 5)):**\n\nH0 is at (6, 5), having just eaten an apple. Neck: (5, 5).\nApples nearby: (7, 5), (7, 6), (9, 7), (7, 4), (6, 9), (5, 9).\n\nSafe options for H0 (6, 5):\n*   UP (6, 6): Body T (NO).\n*   DOWN (6, 4): Empty. YES.\n*   LEFT (5, 5): Neck (NO).\n*   RIGHT (7, 5): Apple A. YES. (Optimal move).\n\n*Prediction for H0 (6, 5):* H0 is highly likely to move RIGHT to (7, 5) to claim the next closest apple. This confirms H0 is dominating the Eastern/Central axis. Therefore, focusing on the Western/Northern axis (where my targets (1, 9), (2, 6), or (3, 9) are) is sound strategy.\n\n**4. Final Plan:**\n\nMove LEFT to (1, 3). This gets me out of the immediate corner and allows me to loop up towards the Western side of the board to attack (1, 9) or maneuver around my body to get to (2, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Snake 1:**\n1. T42: Move LEFT to (1, 3). Opens up movement.\n2. T43: From (1, 3), continue LEFT to (0, 3) or UP to (1, 4). Aim for the northern cluster (1, 9) since H0 is focused on the east. If I go UP, I can then go RIGHT (2, 4) if my tail has cleared (2, 4), but (2, 4) is my neck this turn, so I will have to check body location next turn. Safest is to aim high via (0, y) column.\n\nLEFT",

The RIGHT move is superior because:\n\n1. **Immediate score advantage**: Eating the apple at (7, 5) gives me 25 apples vs enemy's 23\n2. **Clear apple path**: After (7, 5), I can go DOWN to (7, 4) for another apple, then DOWN to (7, 3) for a third apple - that's 3 apples in 3 moves, reaching 27 total\n3. **Enemy is distant**: Enemy head at (2, 3) is far from my path on the right side of the board\n4. **Future options**: After collecting these apples, I have options to move along the empty cells at (8, 3) and (8, 4)\n\nThe DOWN move delays apple collection and doesn't offer as good a path to additional apples.\n\nStrategy: Go RIGHT to (7, 5) to eat apple, continue DOWN to (7, 4), then DOWN to (7, 3) for a sequence of 3 apples, securing a stronger lead before planning further moves.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (1, 3)):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 4):** This is the most direct path toward A1, A2, and A4 cluster. It keeps me in the center/west, avoiding Snake 0.\n    *   T44 options from (1, 4): UP (1, 5) [Body, NO], DOWN (1, 3) [Neck, NO], LEFT (0, 4) [Free], RIGHT (2, 4) [Body, NO]. **CRITICAL SNAFU:** (1, 5) is part of my body!\n    *   Body list: `(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), ...`\n    *   If I move UP to (1, 4), I will be trapped instantly on the next turn because (1, 5) is body and (2, 4) is body and (1, 3) is neck. Moving UP is severely restrictive. **ELIMINATE UP.**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 3):** This moves me to the western wall, which is generally safe and allows upward movement without instant body collision restrictions.\n    *   T44 options from (0, 3): UP (0, 4) [Free], DOWN (0, 2) [Free], LEFT (OOB, NO), RIGHT (1, 3) [Neck, NO].\n    *   (0, 7) and (0, 8) are parts of my body, so I can go up near the wall, aiming for the gap between (0, 4) and (0, 6) to reach the tail or (1, 9). This is a strong maneuver choice.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 2):** This moves me into the lower half of the board, away from the immediate northern apple cluster.\n    *   T44 options from (1, 2): UP (1, 3) [Neck, NO], DOWN (1, 1) [Free], LEFT (0, 2) [Free], RIGHT (2, 2) [Free].\n    *   This is okay for keeping options open, but does not progress toward apples efficiently.\n\n**Strategy Refinement: Aiming for the North via the West Wall**\n\nThe immediate restriction on moving (1, 4) forces me to abandon the most direct route North. Moving LEFT to (0, 3) allows me to travel UP the column Y=0.\n\n1.  Move LEFT to (0, 3).\n2.  Next turn (T44), move UP to (0, 4), then (0, 5), (0, 6).\n3.  From (0, 6), I can go RIGHT to (1, 6) but that's my body. Wait, my body is (0, 7), (0, 8). I need to check my body segments carefully.\n\nCurrent body segments involved in the western half: `(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), ...`\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 3), the path to (1, 9) via the wall:\nT43: (1, 3) -> (0, 3)\nT44: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) [Free]\nT45: (0, 4) -> (0, 5) [Free]\nT46: (0, 5) -> (0, 6) [Free]\nT47: (0, 6) -> (0, 7) [Body, NO!]\n\nMy body is blocking the 'up' route at (0, 7) and (0, 8). I would have to turn into (1, 6) or (1, 7), but both are my body segments. This means the western wall is currently a long dead-end, and I must not enter it unless my tail is about to clear (0, 7) or (0, 8). My tail is at (3, 0), so it will take 24 moves for (0, 7) to clear unless I don't eat.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Northern Path:**\n\nI must move towards X=2 or X=3 to get around my existing snake body that creates a U-shape facing West (around 1, 5/1, 6/1, 7).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 2):\nT43: (1, 3) -> (1, 2)\nT44: From (1, 2), I can move LEFT (0, 2) or RIGHT (2, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 2):\nT45: From (2, 2), I can move UP to (2, 3) [Neck/NO], or RIGHT to (3, 2) [Body/NO]. Only DOWN (2, 1) or LEFT (1, 2) [Neck/NO] is possible. This chokes me again.\n\nThe only remaining sensible choice seems to be moving LEFT to (0, 3), acknowledging the potential blockade, but hoping to find an exit toward x=2 or x=3 before getting trapped. **Wait**, if I go LEFT, I only have UP/(0, 4) and DOWN/(0, 2) next turn. If I go UP to (0, 4), then (0, 5), (0, 6), I hit my body at (0, 7) and (1, 7) is also body. I will be very trapped unless my tail clears that U-bend soon.\n\nLet's check the timing if I go LEFT:\nCurrent position: (1, 3). Body tail: (3, 0). Length 24.\nIf I go LEFT (0, 3), length remains 24.\nT44: H: (0, 4). Tail T: (2, 0).\nT45: H: (0, 5). Tail T: (1, 0).\nT46: H: (0, 6). Tail T: (0, 0).\nT47: H: (0, 7). **Collision with body!**\n\nThis path is fatal in 4 moves, assuming I don't eat. Since (1, 9) is close, the time spent maneuvering needs to be less than 4 moves to get past (0, 7) or (1, 7).\n\n**Plan B: Move DOWN and Re-orient**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 2), it gives me breathing room.\nT43: (1, 3) -> DOWN (1, 2).\nT44: Options: (0, 2) [Free] or (2, 2) [Free].\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 2):\nT45: Options: (2, 1) [Free] or (1, 2) [Neck, NO]. (3, 2) is body.\nThis still severely limits mobility. The density of my body around (2, 3) and (3, 3) is the problem.\n\nLet's look at the apple (2, 6). It is 4 steps away, but requires moving around the body segments at (2, 4) and (2, 5).\n(1, 3) -> (1, 2) [DOWN]\n(1, 2) -> (2, 2) [RIGHT]\n(2, 2) -> (2, 1) [DOWN]\n(2, 1) -> (3, 1) [Body, NO] or (4, 1) [Body, NO]. This is a disaster.\n\nThe only safe direction that *continues* to open space is LEFT. Despite the long-term trap risk along the X=0 wall, it is better than boxing myself in immediately with other directions. I need to get as far north as possible, quickly.\n\nLet's re-examine the target (2, 6).\n(1, 3) -> LEFT (0, 3). [Best maneuverability]\n(0, 3) -> UP (0, 4).\n(0, 4) -> UP (0, 5).\n\nAt (0, 5), I am two moves from (2, 6).\nPath to (2, 6) from (0, 5): R R U.\n(0, 5) -> (1, 5). **Collision with body!** Segment (1, 5) is body. I cannot go right here either.\n\nThe central structure of my snake must be broken up first.\n\nGiven that my snake's structure is blocking all sensible northward routes *except* for continuing straight up the X=1 column (which is blocked after 1 move), and DOWN/RIGHT movements are severely restrictive afterwards, LEFT is still the best move to maintain the most options, even if it brings me to a temporary dead end in 4 turns. I must find a way to cut through x=1 or x=2 before T47.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 3):\nT44: (0, 4). Tail is (2, 0). The space (1, 5) is still occupied.\nT45: (0, 5). Tail is (1, 0).\nT46: (0, 6). Tail is (0, 0). (0, 7) is finally freeing up!\n\nWait, if I don't eat:\nT43: H (0, 3). T (3, 0). Length 24.\nT44: H (0, 4). T (3, 1). Length 24.\nT45: H (0, 5). T (3, 2). Length 24.\nT46: H (0, 6). T (3, 3). Length 24.\nT47: H (0, 7). T (3, 4). Length 24. **Collision.** Segments (0, 7) or (1, 7) are still occupied.\n\nLet's trace the body segment 24 steps back from head (1, 3):\nHead (1, 3)\n23: (3, 0) (Tail)\n22: (3, 1)\n21: (4, 1)\n...\n16: (3, 4)\n...\n6: (1, 7)\n5: (1, 6)\n4: (1, 5)\n3: (2, 5)\n2: (2, 4)\n1: (2, 3) (Neck)\n\nSegment (0, 7) is 7 steps from the head. (0, 8) is 8 steps. (1, 7) is 6 steps. (1, 5) is 4 steps.\nIf I don't eat, these segments will clear when they become the tail.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 3):\nT44: (0, 4). (1, 5) is now (3).\nT45: (0, 5). (1, 5) is now (2).\nT46: (0, 6). (1, 5) is now (1). **Next turn (T47), (1, 5) clears** (becomes tail).\n\nIf I reach (0, 6) on T46, I will hit (0, 7) on T47. Segment (0, 7) clears on T47. Collision!\n\nIf I move LEFT, I must use the time to turn RIGHT into the center of the board, not continue UP the wall.\n(1, 3) -> LEFT (0, 3)\n(0, 3) -> UP (0, 4)\n(0, 4) -> UP (0, 5)\nNow, at (0, 5), if I move RIGHT to (1, 5), I instantly collide.\n\nThis means if I move LEFT, I must turn DOWN at (0, 4) or (0, 5) to loop back around, which is counterproductive to reaching northern apples.\n\n**Conclusion:** All moves are either risky or severely limit future mobility due to my snake's internal congestion. Since (1, 4) is blocked by (1, 5) on the second move, and LEFT leads to an insurmountable wall unless I change direction quickly, DOWN is the move that maintains the most long-term freedom, despite moving away from the target cluster.\n\n*   (1, 3) -> DOWN (1, 2)\n*   T44 from (1, 2): I can go to (0, 2) (LEFT) or (2, 2) (RIGHT). (3, 2) is my body, so right is restricted later.\n    *   (1, 2) -> (0, 2). Then I can go UP (0, 3) [Neck, NO] or DOWN (0, 1). This is still limiting.\n\nLet's assume the body segment list is accurate and (1, 5) is body.\nT43: Move UP (1, 4). Safe.\nT44: Head at (1, 4). Neck (1, 3). Other neighbors: (0, 4) [Free], (2, 4) [Body]. (1, 5) [Body]. TRAPPED immediately.\n\nSince UP is fatally restrictive on T44, and LEFT eventually leads to a necessary turnaround or collision, I must choose DOWN to open the options on the Southern flank, allowing me to circle back East/North or exit through the crowded South.\n\nI will move DOWN to (1, 2). This gives me two safe exits on the next turn, (0, 2) and (2, 2), and allows me to exit the highly congested column X=1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Exit the congestion at (1, 3) by moving DOWN to (1, 2), then RIGHT to (2, 2), and try to find a path into the upper center (X=3 or X=4) where the apples (3, 7) and (2, 6) might become reachable.\n\nDOWN",

From there I have multiple options: DOWN to (7, 3) for another apple, RIGHT to (8, 4) for another apple, or LEFT to (6, 4) which is empty.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5)**: Contains 'T' (my own body) - fatal move.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5)**: Empty cell ('.'), safe but no immediate apple. The only safe follow-up from there would be DOWN to (8, 4) for an apple.\n\nComparing DOWN vs RIGHT:\n- **DOWN** gives me an immediate apple (score 26) and keeps multiple paths open for collecting additional apples at (7, 3) and (8, 4).\n- **RIGHT** delays the apple collection and offers more restricted follow-up options.\n\nThe DOWN move is superior because:\n1. **Immediate score**: Eating apple at (7, 4) gives me 26 apples vs enemy's 23\n2. **Multiple apple paths**: After (7, 4), I can go DOWN to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 4) for more apples\n3. **Flexibility**: LEFT to (6, 4) is also an option if I need maneuvering room\n4. **Enemy position**: Enemy head at (1, 3) is far away, no collision risk\n\nStrategy: Go DOWN to (7, 4) to eat apple, then continue exploring the cluster of apples at (7, 3) and (8, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Neck: (1, 3).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (1, 3)        | My Neck | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| DOWN | (1, 1)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads away from congestion. |\n| LEFT | (0, 2)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Opens space on the west wall. |\n| RIGHT| (2, 2)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   * | Requires check on enemy future moves. |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (H0 at (7, 4)):**\nH0 options: (7, 3) [Apple, A], (8, 4) [Apple, A], (6, 4) [Free], (7, 5) [Neck, NO].\nH0 will likely move to (8, 4) (closer/easier path) or (7, 3) (also a good target). Let's assume H0 moves to (8, 4). This doesn't directly impact my movement near (1, 2).\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (1, 2)):**\n\nMy main goal is still to get North to the apple clusters (1, 9), (2, 6), or (3, 7) by breaking free from the congestion caused by my long body looping around columns X=1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n    *   This is the best vector for moving toward the center of the board, which eventually offers routes North via X=3/X=4.\n    *   Next turn: From (2, 2), options: UP (2, 3) [Body, NO], DOWN (2, 1) [Free], LEFT (1, 2) [Neck, NO], RIGHT (3, 2) [Body, NO].\n    *   **TRAP:** Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) instantly forces me to move DOWN to (2, 1) next turn, boxing me in further in the South-East corner of my own territory. (2, 1) is adjacent to body segments (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2). This is bad. **ELIMINATE RIGHT.**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 1):**\n    *   This continues moving away from the North, but temporarily maximizes maneuverability by taking me to free space.\n    *   Next turn: From (1, 1), options: UP (1, 2) [Neck, NO], DOWN (1, 0) [Free], LEFT (0, 1) [Free], RIGHT (2, 1) [Free].\n    *   This setup gives me three safe exits and allows me to navigate freely in the low row (Y=0, 1). This is a safe, breathing room move.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 2):**\n    *   This moves me toward the West wall, which was previously deemed risky due to a long U-bend blockade starting at (0, 7) and (1, 7).\n    *   Tail is currently at (3, 1). Length 24.\n    *   If I go LEFT (0, 2):\n        *   T45: H: (0, 3). Tail (4, 1).\n        *   T46: H: (0, 4). Tail (4, 2).\n        *   T47: H: (0, 5). Tail (3, 4).\n        *   T48: H: (0, 6). Tail (4, 4).\n        *   T49: H: (0, 7). *Collision with body (0, 7).*\n    *   This still leads to a guaranteed collision on T49 unless I eat or find an exit from X=0. Given I just had to back off the path in the North, pushing toward a 5-turn trap wall isn't ideal unless I can guarantee an apple or an exit.\n\n**Re-evaluation: Need to find an exit toward X=3.**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 1), and then try to swing East, reaching the apples at (6, 0) or (4, 0) might be possible, and then I can navigate up X=3 or X=4.\n\n1.  H1: (1, 2) -> DOWN (1, 1). (Safest, maximizes T45 options).\n2.  T45: H1: (1, 1). Aim RIGHT to (2, 1).\n3.  T46: H1: (2, 1). Aim RIGHT to (3, 1). **Body collision!** (3, 1) is my tail, but it's only *about* to clear. Length 24. If I don't eat, (3, 1) will be my tail **if** the turn before my head moved to (3, 1). But my tail is currently (3, 1). If I move to (2, 1), the tail moves to (4, 1). If I then move to (3, 1), it is safe.\n    *   T44: H: (1, 1). New tail T: (1, 3). Old (3, 1) -> (4, 1).\n    *   T45: If H: (2, 1). New tail T: (1, 2). Old (4, 1) -> (3, 1).\n    *   T46: If H: (3, 1). New tail T: (1, 1). Old (3, 1) -> (4, 2). **Collision!** (3, 1) is a segment. Wait, my body is ordered head-to-tail.\n    Body: ... (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1). Segment (3, 1) is 24th segment.\n    *   T44 (Move DOWN): Head at (1, 2). Tail (3, 1) is discarded. (1, 3) becomes tail.\n        *   Body segments shift: ... (4, 1), (3, 1) -> becomes (4, 1) -> (3, 1) is freed.\n        *   Wait, the body list *provided* is the body *after* the previous movement.\n        *   Body: `[(1, 3), (2, 3), ..., (4, 1), (3, 1)]`. Tail is (3, 1). Q: Is (3, 1) the cell that is vacated this turn? Yes.\n        *   Move (1, 2) -> (1, 1). (3, 1) is now empty. (1, 3) is the new tail position.\n        *   T45: H at (1, 1). If I move RIGHT to (2, 1). (1, 3) is now empty. (2, 3) is new tail position.\n        *   T46: H at (2, 1). If I move RIGHT to (3, 1). **SAFE!** (2, 3) is now empty. (2, 4) is new tail position.\n        *   T47: H at (3, 1). Aim UP/RIGHT/DOWN. (3, 2) is body. (4, 1) is body. (3, 0) is free.\n\nThis path is viable and strategically aims to bypass the internal knot by moving outside it (Y=1) and then potentially moving up column X=3/X=4 where the density is lower (or where segments will clear sooner).\n\nThe overall congestion is focused around X=1/2/3, Y=3/4/5. Moving to Y=1 is a necessary tactical retreat to regain strategic options.\n\nDOWN is the best move to maintain flexibility and enable the outflanking maneuver described above.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T44-T46):** Move DOWN to (1, 1). Then move RIGHT to (2, 1). Then move RIGHT to (3, 1). This should set up an attempt to move North up columns 3 or 4, or head East toward the cluster (6, 0) and (6, 1).\n\nDOWN",

I will assume the list of apples provided is the current state (15 apples). *Self-correction: The board state shows '0' at (8, 4), meaning H0 is there. Since H0 was at (7, 4) last turn and (8, 4) was an apple, H0 ate it. The apple list should reflect the current state (15 apples listed).*\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 1)):**\n\nMy position: (1, 1). Neck: (1, 2).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (1, 2)        | My Neck | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| DOWN | (1, 0)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads close to (4, 0) apple. |\n| LEFT | (0, 1)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | |\n| RIGHT| (2, 1)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Continues path to X=3/X=4. |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (1, 1)):**\n\nMy long-term plan from the previous turn was: (1, 2) -> (1, 1) [DONE] -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1). This plan was designed to maneuver out of the body congestion and get access to the East/North.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 1):**\n    *   This is the next step in the successful plan.\n    *   The path following this is: (2, 1) -> (3, 1). (3, 1) is currently occupied by the tail (3, 1). Since I moved from (1, 2) to (1, 1) last turn, the segment (3, 1) is now empty. (1, 2) is the new tail position. Therefore, moving to (3, 1) next turn will be safe.\n    *   This move maintains the strongest upward/eastward trajectory.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 0):**\n    *   This targets the lower region, possibly aiming for the apple at (4, 0) or (6, 0).\n    *   (1, 0) is safe. If I go here, I am stuck navigating the very bottom row, which is generally clear.\n    *   If I go to (1, 0), the next move would likely be RIGHT to (2, 0), then (3, 0), then to (4, 0) (Apple). This is a safe path to an apple, which is good.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 1):**\n    *   This leads me back toward the wall and ultimately traps me again unless I can move up X=0 quickly. I already decided this wasn't ideal.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT to (2, 1) vs. DOWN to (1, 0):**\n\n1.  **RIGHT (2, 1):** This continues the maneuver to get behind my body's loop, targeting the X=3/X=4 corridor for northward movement. It sets me up for (3, 1) next turn. From (3, 1), I have relatively good options: (3, 0), (4, 1) (Body), (3, 2) (Body). I could proceed to (3, 0) or (4, 0) (Apple near by).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 0):** This diverts immediately to an objective, (4, 0) (3 moves away). This is guaranteed space and an apple.\n\nGiven the competition with Snake 0 (27 apples vs my 23), securing an apple with a high certainty path is highly valuable.\n\nPath to (4, 0) via DOWN:\nT45: (1, 1) -> DOWN (1, 0).\nT46: (1, 0) -> RIGHT (2, 0).\nT47: (2, 0) -> RIGHT (3, 0).\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (EAT) or (4, 0) is blocked by T0.\n\nLet's check the map around (4, 0):\n(4, 0) is A. (5, 0) is free. (6, 0) is A. (7, 0) is occupied by 'T' (Snake 0 body).\n\nSnake 0 is far away (H0 at (8, 4)). Snake 0's path focuses on the East/North.\n\nIf I take the RIGHT path:\nT45: (1, 1) -> RIGHT (2, 1).\nT46: (2, 1) -> RIGHT (3, 1). (Tail vacated this spot one turn ago).\nT47: (3, 1) -> DOWN (3, 0).\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0). (EAT).\n\nBoth paths take 4 turns to reach the (4, 0) apple, assuming no other apples are consumed to increase length.\n\nPath 1 (DOWN): (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0).\nPath 2 (RIGHT): (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0).\n\nThe RIGHT path (Path 2) has the advantage of pulling my body segments from X=1/Y=1 toward X=2/Y=1 and X=3/Y=1. This opens up (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0) for moves later, as opposed to immediately filling (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0) segments as a body trail.\n\nPath 2 (RIGHT) seems strategically superior as it continues to unwind the congested body loop while still heading toward an objective.\n\nLet's stick to the plan: Move RIGHT. It maintains options in the Y=1 level and preps for moving across the bottom towards the center/right if needed, or swinging North up the clear lanes at X=3/4.\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 check:** H0 is (8, 4). H0 is likely aiming for apples at (7, 3), (7, 6), (9, 7), or (8, 1). H0 is far away and won't interfere with my low movements.\n\n**Future Plan (T45-T48):**\nT45: (1, 1) -> RIGHT (2, 1). // Unwinding\nT46: (2, 1) -> RIGHT (3, 1). // Unwinding further\nT47: (3, 1) -> DOWN (3, 0). // Accessing low row\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (Apple). // Eat!\n\nRIGHT",

However, checking what happens next - after moving there, my body shifts and (8, 5) becomes surrounded by my own body segments: (8, 6) is my body above, (7, 5) is my body to the left, (9, 5) is my body to the right, and (8, 4) becomes my new body segment below. All four directions would be fatal on the next turn. This is a death trap.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 3)**: Empty cell, safe immediately. After moving here, my tail at (6, 3) will shift forward, freeing that space. Next turn I have good options: LEFT to (7, 3) for an apple, or DOWN to (8, 2) which is empty.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 4)**: This is my own body segment (first part of my body after head). Fatal.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: This is also my own body segment. Fatal.\n\nOnly DOWN keeps me alive with future options.

The body is now `(1, 1), (1, 2), ...`. The segment at (3, 2) is now the tail's neck.

So, (3, 0) is the intended continuation.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 0):**\n    *   This is an alternative route toward the (4, 0) or (6, 0) apple.\n    *   **T47 Target:** From (2, 0), I would move RIGHT to (3, 0).\n    *   This path is: (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) (Apple).

(3 turns total to apple).\n    *   Movement: (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) (Apple).\n    *   This move maximizes the space cleared behind the snake's head area and continues the beneficial maneuver.\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 0):** This sets up (3, 0) next turn, then (4, 0) (Apple) the turn after. (3 turns total to apple).\n    *   Movement: (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) (Apple).\n    *   This move locks me into the bottom row earlier, potentially making it harder to swing up later.\n\nBoth options reach (4, 0) in 3 turns. The RIGHT move (to (3, 1)) maintains the overall strategy of moving East while unwinding the dense segments near X=1/2. This gives me better vertical options (up to (3, 2) is blocked, but (4, 3) is potentially open later) compared to being locked on Y=0.\n\nI will stick to the plan and move RIGHT.\n\n**Check Enemy H0:**\nH0 is at (8, 3). H0 is very far away, likely looking at (7, 3) (Apple), (8, 1) (Apple), or climbing North/West. No immediate threat to my path at the South end.\n\n**Future Plan (T46-T49):**\nT46: (2, 1) -> RIGHT (3, 1). // Unwinding\nT47: (3, 1) -> DOWN (3, 0). // Accessing low row\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (Apple). // Eat!\nT49: Evaluate next apple (likely (6, 0) or (0, 4)).\n\nRIGHT",

H(3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> ... My body segment is at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5). (4, 1) is empty. The map shows T (snake body) at (4, 2). (4, 1) is shown as empty ('.'). **Re-check collision at (4, 1).** |\n\nLet's carefully verify the body segments:\nHead: (3, 1).\nBody: (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2) (Tail).\n\n*   (4, 1) is not on this list. It is safe from self-collision.\n*   (4, 1) is not occupied by Snake 0.\n*   (4, 1) is on the board.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**UP to (3, 2):** Since I am not eating an apple, my tail (3, 2) will move to (4, 2), freeing (3, 2). This is safe.\n**DOWN to (3, 0):** Safe. Leads toward (4, 0) apple.\n**RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Leads toward (4, 0) apple.\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves (H1 at (3, 1)):**\n\nThe previous plan was: T47: (3, 1) -> DOWN (3, 0). T48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (Apple).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 0):**\n    *   Distance to (4, 0) apple: 2 steps ((3, 0) -> (4, 0)).\n    *   This is the most direct path to the (4, 0) apple which is my primary local target.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   Distance to (4, 0) apple: 2 steps ((4, 1) -> (4, 0)).\n    *   This is also a good path, but involves moving adjacent to the apple first, which could be slightly less optimal if I suddenly need to change direction (e.g., if H0 rushed me, which is unlikely).\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   This moves me back into the dense area of my own body, undoing the unwinding effort. Although safe, it doesn't target any nearby apple and restricts future movement. Let's discard this.\n\n**Decision: DOWN vs. RIGHT**\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT reach (4, 0) in 2 turns.\n\n1.  **DOWN (3, 0):** This forces me onto the Y=0 edge. From (4, 0), the next logical apple is (6, 0).\n2.  **RIGHT (4, 1):** This keeps me on the Y=1 line. If I go to (4, 0) next, I will be pinned on the edge anyway.\n\nSince the goal is to reach (4, 0) efficiently, DOWN to (3, 0) is the continuation of the planned path and is slightly more straightforward for the subsequent RIGHT move next turn.\n\n**Check Enemy H0:**\nH0 is at (7, 3). H0 is significantly closer to apples like (7, 6), (6, 1), (8, 1), or the dense North-East cluster. Snake 0 is far from (4, 0). I have free reign over the South-West area.\n\n**Future Plan (T47-T50):**\nT47 (Current): (3, 1) -> DOWN (3, 0).\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (Apple). (Eat)\nT49: Evaluate next apple (likely (6, 0) or potentially swing back to (0, 4)).\nT50: (4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0) (Apple). (If (6, 0) is targeted).\n\nDOWN\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 47 / 150\n\n**Game State Analysis:**\n*   My Head (H1) is at (3, 1). Tail (T1) is at (3, 2).\n*   Apples: Nearest target is (4, 0) (2 steps away). (6, 0) is the second nearest.\n*   Enemy H0 is at (7, 3), posing no threat to the (4, 0) apple.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves:**\nSafe moves are UP (3, 2 - tail will vacate), DOWN (3, 0), and RIGHT (4, 1). LEFT (2, 1) is the neck, so it is blocked.\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves:**\nThe short-term goal is to eat the apple at (4, 0).\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (3, 0):** This places the head adjacent to the Y=0 boundary. Path: (3, 1) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) (Apple). (2 turns to apple).\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (4, 1):** Path: (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0) (Apple). (2 turns to apple).\n\nBoth moves are equally fast. DOWN continues the established plan and moves the snake toward the immediate target apple along the periphery. This is preferred for minimizing contact with my dense body segments.\n\n**3. Conclusion:** Move DOWN.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Eating it is a priority.\n*   Resulting state: Head at (4, 0), length increases to 25.\n*   Next turn, I will be well-positioned to consider (6, 0) or potentially (4, 2) or (6, 1) apples nearby.\n\nB. **Move LEFT to (2, 0):**\n*   This moves away from the target apple (4, 0).\n*   If both apples (4, 0) and (6, 0) are clear, moving away makes no sense.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position (H0 at (6, 3)):**\n\nH0 is at (6, 3). It is nowhere near (4, 0). Snake 0 is still closer to the North/East apples ((6, 1), (7, 6), (8, 1), or up north). Snake 0 is not a threat to my immediate move.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Selection:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 0) achieves the objective of eating the nearest apple safely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T48-T51):**\nT48: (3, 0) -> RIGHT (4, 0) (EAT Apple).\nT49: Target the next apple, likely (6, 0) or (4, 2). (6, 0) is 2 steps away ((5, 0), (6, 0)). (4, 2) is 2 steps away ((4, 1), (4, 2)). (6, 1) is 3 steps away. I prefer (6, 0) to stay on the edge, or (4, 2) if (6, 0) seems threatened. Given the empty space at (5, 0), let's target (6, 0) first.\nT50: (4, 0) -> RIGHT (5, 0).\nT51: (5, 0) -> RIGHT (6, 0) (EAT Apple).\n\nRIGHT",

Tail (T1) at (3, 3).\n    *   Length: 25.\n    *   Apples Collected: 24.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (5, 3). (Must have moved LEFT from (6, 3)).\n    *   Body: `[(6, 3), (7, 3), ..., (6, 2)]`. Tail (T0) at (6, 2).\n    *   Length: 29.\n    *   Apples Collected: 28.\n*   **Apples A (14):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (4, 9), (6, 0), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (8, 1), (0, 4), (4, 2). (Apple at (4, 0) was just consumed by me).\n\nI am behind in score (24 vs 28). I need to continue aggressively consuming apples, especially those near the bottom/left where the enemy is less concentrated.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (4, 0)):**\n\nMy current position: (4, 0). Neck: (3, 0).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (4, 1)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads towards (4, 2). |\n| DOWN | (4, -1)       | Off board | Boundary.       | NO    | |\n| LEFT | (3, 0)        | My Neck | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| RIGHT| (5, 0)        | Empty   | No collision.   | YES   | Leads towards (6, 0) apple. |\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Targets and Strategic Moves:**\n\nNearby available apples:\n1. (6, 0): 2 steps (via (5, 0)).\n2. (4, 2): 2 steps (via (4, 1)).\n3. (6, 1): 3 steps (via (5, 1) if moving RIGHT, or (4, 1), (5, 1) if moving UP).\n4. (8, 1): 4 steps.\n\nA. **Move RIGHT to (5, 0):**\n*   This targets (6, 0).\n*   Pro: Stays on the safe bottom edge. Leads to an apple next turn.\n*   Con: If H0 moves (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1), it might block pathways later, but H0 is currently 3 rows above me. H0's current location (5, 3) seems aimed at apples like (7, 6) or maintaining position near the center/top.\n\nB. **Move UP to (4, 1):**\n*   This targets (4, 2).\n*   Pro: Leads to an apple next turn.\n*   Con: Moves me into the board interior where walls and body segments are thicker.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 3)):**\n\nH0 is at (5, 3). Snake 0's last known movement pattern was moving LEFT to (5, 3).\nPossible moves for H0 this turn:\n*   UP (5, 4): Empty. Leads towards (5, 9), (4, 9).\n*   DOWN (5, 2): Empty/T0's tail (T0 is at (6, 2), so (5, 2) is free). Leads towards (6, 1), (4, 2).\n*   LEFT (4, 3): T1's body segment (3, 3) is my tail, but (4, 3) is currently empty.\n*   RIGHT (6, 3): Hitting H0's neck. NO.\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (5, 2), it puts itself 2 steps away from (4, 2) and (6, 1). If I was aiming for (4, 2) via UP to (4, 1), H0 could potentially reach (5, 1) next turn, crowding me.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 0) targeting (6, 0):\n*   H0 moving down (5, 2) is 2 rows away. I seem safer here. (6, 0) is relatively isolated from H0's main cluster.\n\nLet's stick to the plan of securing (6, 0).\n\n*Current Plan:* (4, 0) -> RIGHT (5, 0).\n\n**4. Collision Check (RIGHT move to (5, 0)):**\n\n*   My head (4, 0) moves to (5, 0). Safe from self and border.\n*   Check for H0 moving into (5, 0): H0 is at (5, 3).\n    *   To hit (5, 0), H0 would need to move DOWN 3 times straight. H0 can only reach (5, 2), (4, 3), or (5, 4) in one turn. No head-on collision or death by H0 entering (5, 0) is possible this turn.\n\nThe move RIGHT seems safe and highly beneficial.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T49-T51):**\nT49: (4, 0) -> RIGHT (5, 0). Targeting (6, 0).\nT50: (5, 0) -> RIGHT (6, 0) (EAT Apple).\nT51: Reassess. Likely target (6, 1) or (4, 2), depending on enemy position. (4, 2) is safe if H0 doesn't commit to the bottom middle.\n\nRIGHT",

(Moved DOWN from (5, 3) or UP from (5, 1) or RIGHT from (4, 2) etc.)\n    *   Body: `[(5, 3), (6, 3), ..., (7, 2)]`. Tail (T0) at (7, 2).\n    *   Length: 29.\n    *   Apples Collected: 28.\n*   **Apples A (15):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (6, 1), (3, 7), (4, 9), (6, 0), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (8, 1), (0, 4), (4, 2), (8, 9).\n\nI moved RIGHT to (5, 0) last turn, aiming for (6, 0). Snake 0 moved from (5, 3) to (5, 2). This puts H0 very close to the action zone.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (5, 0)):**\n\nMy current position: (5, 0). Neck: (4, 0).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :------ | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (5, 1)        | Empty   | Self/Border/Enemy body safe. *Potential H0 collision.* | Maybe | H0 is at (5, 2). UP moves me closer to H0. |\n| DOWN | (5, -1)       | Off board | Boundary.       | NO    | |\n| LEFT | (4, 0)        | My Neck | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| RIGHT| (6, 0)        | Apple A | No collision.   | YES   | Guaranteed Apple. |\n\nSafe move: RIGHT (to (6, 0)). UP (to (5, 1)) is theoretically safe from immediate death, but highly risky due to H0 at (5, 2) and the available immediate apple target.\n\n**2. Evaluate Targets and Strategic Moves:**\n\nThe apple at (6, 0) is immediately reachable by moving RIGHT. This increases my score to 25.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 0) (Apples: 25, Length: 27).\nNext possible apples:\na) (6, 1) - 1 step (UP).\nb) (8, 1) - 2 steps (via (7, 1)).\nc) (4, 2) - 3 steps (various routes).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (5, 2)):**\n\nH0 at (5, 2) is threatening the apples in the (4, 2) / (6, 1) area.\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   UP (5, 3): H0's neck. NO.\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Empty. This is a very strong move for H0, getting closer to (6, 1) or (4, 2).\n*   LEFT (4, 2): Apple A. H0 can eat (4, 2). Excellent move.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Empty.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 0), H0 moving in any of those directions does not result in an immediate head-on collision or H0 running into my body.\n\n*   If H0 moves LEFT (4, 2) (eats apple): H0's path is (5, 2) -> (4, 2). My path is (5, 0) -> (6, 0). We are completely separate.\n*   If H0 moves DOWN (5, 1): H0 will be 1 spot away from (6, 1). I will be adjacent to (6, 1) at (6, 0).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 0) is the optimal and safest move this turn. It guarantees an apple and allows me to contest for (6, 1) next turn.\n\n**4. Collision Check (RIGHT move to (6, 0)):**\n\n*   My head (5, 0) moves to (6, 0). Safe from self and border.\n*   Check for H0 moving into (6, 0): H0 is at (5, 2). H0 cannot reach (6, 0) in one move.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T51):**\nAfter eating (6, 0), I will be at (6, 0). H0 will likely be at (5, 1) or (4, 2).\n1. If H0 is at (5, 1) (targeting (6, 1) or (4, 2)), I should move UP to (6, 1) to claim the second apple immediately.\n2. If H0 is at (4, 2) (ate the apple), I can move UP to (6, 1) to claim it, or potentially head towards (7, 1) or (8, 1).\n\nThe next immediate target will be (6, 1).\n\nRIGHT",

Moving directly backwards into my own body kills me. Not safe.\n\n- DOWN to (5, 1): Board shows empty ('.'). Safe. However, enemy head at (5, 0) could also move UP to (5, 1), causing a head-on collision.\n\n- LEFT to (4, 2): Board shows 'A' - this is an apple! Safe and I eat.\n\n- RIGHT to (6, 2): Board shows empty ('.'). Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n\nLEFT to (4, 2): Eat an apple immediately! From (4, 2) next turn, I can go UP to (4, 3), DOWN to (4, 1), or LEFT to (3, 2) - 3 safe options and good flexibility.\n\nDOWN to (5, 1): Risky because enemy at (5, 0) might also move UP to (5, 1), causing head-on collision. From (5, 1), I'd have 2-3 options depending on enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT to (6, 2): No apple. From (6, 2), I can go DOWN to (6, 1) for an apple or RIGHT to (7, 2) - only 2 options.\n\nLEFT is clearly the best choice - it gives me an apple this turn, provides the most future options (3), and has no collision risk with the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

H1 is now at (6, 0) and H0 is at (4, 2). H0 is still 4 apples ahead of me.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (6, 0)):**\n\nCurrent position: (6, 0).

Looking at the board, (7, 0) is T. | NO    | Part of H0's body. |\n\n**Safe Move:** UP (to (6, 1)). This is an immediate apple grab.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (4, 2)):**\n\nH0 at (4, 2). Neck: (5, 2).\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   UP (4, 3): Enemy Body T. NO.\n*   DOWN (4, 1): My Body segment (4, 1) is T. NO.\n*   LEFT (3, 2): Empty. Good move.\n*   RIGHT (5, 2): H0's Neck. NO.\n\n*Correction*: Let's check H0's body carefully: `[(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]`.\nIf H0 moved to (4, 2), its body shifted. The new body list will start at (5, 2). The tail (T0) will be the second-to-last segment from the old list, (7, 2), assuming the snake did *not* eat (which it did, at (4, 2)).\n\nH0 is at (4, 2) (eaten). H0 is now 30 long. The segment that was previously the tail, (7, 2), remains part of the body.\nH0's current body: `[(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), ... (7, 1), (7, 2)]`.\nChecking H0 moves from (4, 2):\n*   UP (4, 3): Occupied by my body (segment (4, 3) is T). YES, safe for H0. (My body is (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4). (4, 3) is empty/board, but I missed checking the enemy body chart against the board state.)\n    *Board State Check:* (4, 3) is T (My body is T). My body includes (4, 8) down to (3, 4). No, my body list ends at (3, 4). The head is (6, 0). (4, 3) is NOT in my body list: `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4)]`. (4, 3) is currently empty (.). Oh, wait. The board state shows (4, 3) is T. Let's recheck the board state diagram vs the lists.\n    Board:\n    4 A . T T T . . T T T\n    3 . T T . . T T T T T\n    (4, 3) is indeed T. It must belong to H0. H0's body segments: (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)... Okay, the segment (5, 3) leads to (6, 3). (5, 3) is T. (4, 3) is T. Let's look at the body list again: `[(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)...]`\n    If H0 moved (5, 2) -> (4, 2), the segment (5, 3) is now the second segment. (4, 3) is NOT listed in the body segments. This means the board diagram is sometimes misleading or I am misinterpreting it. Let's trust the coordinate lists.\n    *Relying on Lists:* H0's body segments after moving to (4, 2) are all segments from the old body plus the new neck (5, 2). So (4, 3) is safe *unless* it's my body. My body segments are listed above. (4, 3) is not one of them. H0 moving UP to (4, 3) is highly likely safe and aggressive.\n\n*   DOWN (4, 1): My body segment (4, 0) is my neck. (4, 1) is T (my body T). My body includes (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)... but not (4, 1). Ah, (4, 1) is T. It belongs to me. *My body segment (3, 1) is near here, but (4, 1) is not listed.* Let's stick strictly to the coordinates provided for my body: `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), ... (3, 4)]`. (4, 1) is not in there. If it's T, it belongs to H0.\n    H0 body segments: (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1) are near the bottom. (7, 1) is in H0's body. (8, 1) is an Apple. (9, 1) is in H0's body. (4, 1) is not listed for H0. If (4, 1) is T, it must be the tail, (7, 2), which is where the tail was before the apple eat. No, the tail segment shifts. If H0 ate, the tail remains (7, 2). The body is 30 long.\n    *Conclusion on T/Empty cells:* Given the conflict, I must assume any coordinate not explicitly listed in my or H0's body (or as an Apple/Head) is safe, unless it kills me.\n\nLet's assume the safest reading: H0 must choose (3, 2) or (4, 3). Both are empty on the board map, and neither appears in my body list. H0 will likely try to grab central apples like (3, 7) or (2, 6).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 1) and eat the apple:\nMy position: (6, 1). Length 28. Next target: (8, 1) or perhaps (7, 6) or (2, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate Next Targets and Strategy:**\n\nThe move (6, 1) is an immediate, zero-risk apple gain. This is non-negotiable.\n\nAfter T51 (move UP to (6, 1)), I will be at (6, 1).\nTargets nearby:\n1. (7, 1): Empty (but part of H0's travel route often).\n2. (8, 1): Apple (2 steps via (7, 1)).\n3. (7, 6): Apple (5 steps).\n4. (2, 6): Apple (5 steps).\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (3, 2), H0 is positioned well for future UP moves toward the northern cluster of apples ((3, 7), (2, 6), (3, 9)).\nIf H0 moves UP to (4, 3), H0 is also positioned for central/northern apples.\n\nSince I am boxed in by my own neck (5, 0) and H0's body (7, 0) below me, moving UP is the only safe move to progress towards more apples.\n\nNext turn (T52) plan: From (6, 1), I should assess the risk of moving RIGHT towards (8, 1) versus moving UP/LEFT towards the center.\n*   (7, 1) is potentially dangerous if H0 is maneuvering towards the right side of the board. (7, 1) is listed in H0's body, meaning it is safe for H0 to move off of (it will be its tail or empty after T51). **Rereading H0's body list: (7, 1) IS a body segment.** If H0 does not crash, (7, 1) will be empty next turn!\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 1), the immediate best follow-up is RIGHT to (7, 1) then RIGHT to (8, 1) to secure the second apple. (8, 1) is a critical apple.\n\n**4. Collision Check (UP move to (6, 1)):**\n\n*   My head (6, 0) moves to (6, 1). Safe from self and border.\n*   Check for H0 moving into (6, 1): H0 is at (4, 2). H0 cannot reach (6, 1) in one move.\n*   Check for head-on collision: no other snake can reach (6, 1).\n\nThe move UP is 100% safe and guarantees an apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T52 onwards):**\nAfter eating (6, 1), I am at (6, 1).\n1. H0 is likely moving to position itself for the central/northern apples (e.g., (3, 7), (2, 6)).\n2. My primary goal should be to maximize score now and secure (8, 1). I will aim RIGHT (to (7, 1)) then RIGHT (to (8, 1)). I need to confirm (7, 1) becomes empty (it was H0 body segment (7, 1)). Since H0 ate an apple, the tail segment (7, 2) remains, and all other segments shift. (7, 1) will remain part of H0's body unless H0's tail was (7, 1), which it wasn't.\n\nWait, if H0 is 30 long, and doesn't lose its tail, then (7, 1) remains occupied by H0's body.\nH0 Body list (post T51): (5, 2) -> ... -> (7, 1) -> (7, 2). (7, 2) is the tail segment that remains. (7, 1) is the segment before the tail. It is occupied.\n\nLet's re-examine the board state:\n0 A . . T T T 1 T T T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(7, 1) is marked T (H0's body). (8, 1) is A.\n\nIf the move UP to (6, 1) is executed, I am still 2 steps from (8, 1), but cannot move to (7, 1) because H0's body is there.\n\nIf (7, 1) is occupied, I must move UP/LEFT from (6, 1) towards the center/top, or maneuver around my body or H0's body on the right edge.\n\nFrom (6, 1):\n1. LEFT to (5, 1): Empty. Good if H0 is not going down to (5, 1). H0 is at (4, 2). H0 moving to (3, 2) or (4, 3) is likely. Moving to (5, 1) is aggressive for H0, but possible.\n2. UP to (6, 2): Empty/H0 body. (6, 2) is empty. Safe move, allows pursuit of (6, 9) or (7, 6).\n\nIf (7, 1) is blocked, the immediate path to (8, 1) is gone. I should focus on the central cluster.\n\nPlan:\nT51: UP (Eat 6, 1). At (6, 1).\nT52: UP to (6, 2) to continue gaining altitude towards (7, 6) (3 steps) or (2, 6) (4 steps).\n\nUP",

(Just ate the apple at (6, 1)).\n    *   Neck: (6, 0).\n    *   Length: 27.\n    *   Apples Collected: 26.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (4, 3). (H0 moved UP from (4, 2) to (4, 3)). *Note: This assumes H0 moved UP. Let's verify H0's current location from input.*\n    *   H0 Head: (4, 3).\n    *   H0 Neck: (4, 2).\n    *   Length: 30.\n    *   Apples Collected: 29.\n*   **Apples A (14 remaining):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (8, 1), (0, 4), (8, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (2, 0).\n\nThe gap is 3 apples. I need to catch up. H0 is centrally located and moving high. I need to move high or target the remaining low apples quickly. Since I am at (6, 1), the nearest remaining low apple is (8, 1) or (2, 0) or (0, 0). (8, 1) is 2 steps away if the path is clear.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (6, 1)):**\n\nCurrent position: (6, 1). Neck: (6, 0).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (6, 2)        | Empty (.)             | Safe.           | YES   | Leads higher. |\n| DOWN | (6, 0)        | My Neck               | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| LEFT | (5, 1)        | Empty (.)             | Check H0.       | YES   | H0 is at (4, 3). Unlikely H0 moves to (5, 1). |\n| RIGHT| (7, 1)        | Enemy Body T          | Hitting H0.     | NO    | (7, 1) is listed in H0's body. |\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP (6, 2) and LEFT (5, 1).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 at (4, 3)):**\n\nH0 Neck: (4, 2).\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   UP (4, 4): My Body T. My body includes (4, 4). NO.\n*   DOWN (4, 2): H0 Neck. NO.\n*   LEFT (3, 3): Enemy Body T. H0's body includes (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2) (Wait, no, H0's body list is `... (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)...`). My body includes (3, 4). (3, 3) is T on the board diagram. Checking H0's body list, (3, 3) is not listed. Checking my body list, (3, 3) is not listed. If T, it must be H0. Let's assume (3, 3) is blocked by H0 unless H0's tail was (3, 3).\n*   RIGHT (5, 3): Enemy Body T. H0's body is (5, 2), (5, 3), ... (5, 3) is H0's body. NO.\n\n*Re-checking H0 Body and Board:*\nH0 Body: `[(4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]`. (30 segments total)\n\nH0's safe movements from (4, 3):\n*   (4, 4): My body segment (4, 4) is occupied. **Collision.**\n*   (3, 3): Safe. (Not listed in either body). This leads towards apples (3, 7) and (3, 9).\n*   (5, 3): H0 body segment. **Collision.**\n*   (4, 2): H0 neck. **Collision.**\n\nH0 MUST move LEFT to (3, 3).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (Head at (6, 1)):**\n\nSince H0 is moving LEFT towards the crucial central/northern apples, I need to gain altitude to intercept or grab other nearby apples.\n\nOption A: Move UP to (6, 2).\n*   Safe move. Sets me up for (7, 6) (4 steps) or (6, 9) (7 steps).\n*   If I move to (6, 2), I deny H0 access to moving right into my territory later (though that seems unlikely given H0's constraints).\n\nOption B: Move LEFT to (5, 1).\n*   Safe move. This moves me away from the wall but also away from the immediate upper apples and towards H0's path. If H0 moves (3, 3), and I move (5, 1), we are not immediately colliding, but H0 is now closer to me, and I opened up (6, 1) for H0 to potentially use later (though H0 will prefer to move North/West).\n\nGiven H0's constrained path to (3, 3), H0 will continue trying to reach (3, 7) or (2, 6). I should move UP to quickly contest the central area.\n\nFrom (6, 2):\n*   I can go UP to (6, 3) (H0 body T, or empty). H0 body list shows (6, 3) is occupied. NO.\n*   I can go RIGHT to (7, 2) (H0 body T / Tail, or empty). H0 body tail is (7, 2). Since H0 did *not* eat the last turn (H0 moved (4, 2) -> (4, 3)), the body shrinks, and (7, 2) becomes empty! This is a VITAL insight.\n\nIf H0 moved (4, 2) -> (4, 3), and no apple was eaten, the segment (7, 2) (the tail) drops off and becomes available space.\n\nPath to (8, 2) Apple:\n1. T52: Move UP to (6, 2). (Safe)\n2. T53: Move RIGHT to (7, 2). (Now empty!)\n3. T54: Move RIGHT to (8, 2) (Apple!).\n\nThis gives me a low-risk 3-turn plan for an apple, while H0 is stuck moving West towards apples I can potentially intercept later if H0 slows down. This is better than moving left immediately.\n\nLet's confirm the move UP to (6, 2) is safe regarding H0's movement (H0 to (3, 3)). Neither snake conflicts paths.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to (6, 2) to establish the immediate 3-turn path to the (8, 2) apple, which H0 cannot contest.\n\n*Self-Correction on T51 Rationale:* I incorrectly assumed H0 ate an apple at T51. The state provided shows H0 at H(4, 3) and body starting at (4, 2). If H0 was at (4, 2) at T51 start, it moved to (4, 3) and consumed no apple. Thus, H0's tail (7, 2) MUST have vacated.\n\nH0 body before T52: `(4, 2), (5, 2), ... (7, 1)`. (7, 2) is now free space.\n\nThe plan holds: UP to (6, 2).\n\nUP\n**Long-Term Plan (T53 onwards):**\n1. T53: Move RIGHT to (7, 2) (Space vacated by H0's tail).\n2. T54: Move RIGHT to (8, 2) (Apple!).\n3. Then evaluate pursuit of (8, 9) or (8, 1) from (8, 2).",

I misread my last step rationale. I planned UP to (6, 2) but the move executed was RIGHT. This changes things drastically.)\n    *   Body starts at (6, 1).\n    *   Apples Collected: 26.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (3, 3). (H0 moved LEFT from (4, 3) to (3, 3). This was the expected move based on H0's constraints.)\n    *   Body starts at (4, 3).\n    *   Apples Collected: 29.\n*   **Apples A (15 remaining):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (8, 1), (0, 4), (8, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (2, 0).\n    *   (8, 1) and (8, 2) are very close to me.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 1)):**\n\nCurrent position: (7, 1). Neck: (6, 1).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (7, 2)        | Enemy Body T / Empty. | Check H0 tail.  | YES?  | Last turn H0 moved from (4, 3) to (3, 3). No apple eaten. H0's tail segment (7, 0) should have dropped off. No, H0's tail was (7, 0) *before* the move. After H0 moved (4, 3) -> (3, 3), the tail (7, 0) is now empty. (7, 1) was occupied by H0 before my move, but I moved into it. Let's re-examine H0's old body: `(4, 2), (5, 2), ..., (7, 0)`. My Head is now at (7, 1). The target (7, 2) is listed in the input as \"T\" on the board diagram. Where does (7, 2) belong? H0's **current** body: `(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0)`. The H0 body list provided in the current state does **not** include (7, 2). *Therefore, (7, 2) is either empty, or it was my old body segment, or it was where H0's head was.* The board shows T at (7, 2). Wait, the board shows 1 at (7, 1), A at (8, 1), T at (6, 1), T at (8, 2). And (7, 2) is empty (.). Let's trust the board diagram: (7, 2) is empty. |\n| DOWN | (7, 0)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body includes (7, 0). | NO   | |\n| LEFT | (6, 1)        | My Neck (T)           | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| RIGHT| (8, 1)        | Apple (A)             | Immediate win/growth. | YES   | This is the best move. |\n\n*Self-Correction on board reading:*\nBoard line Y=2: `. T . . T T . . A T`\n(7, 2) is '.', which means empty.\n(8, 2) is 'A', which means Apple.\n\nBoard line Y=1: `. T T T . . T 1 A T`\n(7, 1) is '1' (My Head).\n(8, 1) is 'A' (Apple).\n\n**The move to (8, 1) is safe and eats an apple, increasing my lead potential.**\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 Head at (3, 3)):**\n\nH0 Neck: (4, 3).\nH0 is trapped high and towards the left wall.\nH0's safe moves from (3, 3):\n*   UP (3, 4): My Body T. NO.\n*   DOWN (3, 2): Empty (.). Safe.\n*   LEFT (2, 3): My Body T. NO. (My body includes (2, 3)).\n*   RIGHT (4, 3): H0 Neck. NO.\n\nH0 MUST move DOWN to (3, 2). This keeps H0 away from me for now, and H0 is hunting low apples like (2, 0) or (0, 0) or trying to get around my snake body barrier.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 1)):**\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 1) to eat the apple. This gives me +1 point, 27 apples total. H0 moves DOWN to (3, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T54 onwards):**\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 1), my head will be (8, 1), and my body length increases.\nApple (8, 2) is now immediately adjacent.\nT54: Move UP to (8, 2) (Apple!). This gives me +1 point, 28 apples total.\nT55: From (8, 2), I can consider moving to (8, 3) (H0 body T) or (9, 2) (H0 body T). I will need to check H0's body dynamics carefully. The apple at (9, 7) or (8, 9) seems attractive next.\n\nFor this turn, the move is overwhelmingly RIGHT to grab the apple at (8, 1).\n\nRIGHT",

Length increased.)\n    *   Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n    *   Apples Collected: 27.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (3, 4). (H0 moved UP from (3, 3) to (3, 4). Wait, in the previous turn's analysis, I assumed H0 would move DOWN to (3, 2) because (3, 4) was listed as my body 'T' (My body segment (3, 4) is not in my body list). Let's recheck the board state for (3, 4) from the game description. Okay, the provided state shows: `4 A . T 0 T . . T T T`. (3, 4) is '0', the enemy head. This means the enemy took a path I considered unsafe for them, or my safety check on (3, 4) was wrong previously. My body currently runs along Y=4 ending at (4, 4), which is part of my body. (3, 4) is not my body. (3, 3) is H0's neck. H0 moved UP from (3, 3) to (3, 4).\n    *   Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0)]. (Note: H0 appears to have *not* eaten an apple, as their tail (8, 0) dropped off. The enemy body list provided is now 29 segments long. Wait, I should not assume they didn't eat based on the new body length, but based on the score change. The score still shows 29. The body length calculation: 29 segments + head = 30. Last turn H0 had 29 segments + head = 30. No apple was eaten by H0).\n    *   Apples Collected: 29.\n*   **Apples A (14 remaining):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (0, 4), (8, 9), (8, 2), (0, 0), (2, 0).\n    *   (8, 2) is immediately adjacent to H1.\n\n**2. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 1)):**\n\nCurrent position: (8, 1). Neck: (7, 1).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (8, 2)        | Apple (A)             | Check H0 move.  | YES?  | EAT. Great move. |\n| DOWN | (8, 0)        | Empty (.)             | H0's old tail (8, 0) dropped off. | YES   | Safe but avoids apple. |\n| LEFT | (7, 1)        | My Neck (T)           | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| RIGHT| (9, 1)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body includes (9, 1). | NO    | (9, 1) is T in the diagram, and is in H0's body list. |\n\nThe best move is UP to (8, 2) to eat the next apple.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 Head at (3, 4)):**\n\nH0 Neck: (3, 3). H0 is in the middle-left area.\nH0's adjacent cells:\n*   (3, 5): Empty.\n*   (4, 4): My Body (T). NO.\n*   (2, 4): My Body (T). NO.\n*   (3, 3): H0 Neck. NO.\n\nH0 MUST move UP to (3, 5).\n\nSince H0 is moving: H0 (3, 4) -> (3, 5).\nAnd I am moving: H1 (8, 1) -> (8, 2).\n\nThere is zero risk of collision. My move is safe and scores another point to catch up to H0.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 1)):**\n\nMove UP to (8, 2) to eat the apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T55 onwards):**\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 2), my head will be (8, 2). I will be tied with H0 at 29 apples.\nFrom (8, 2), safe moves might include:\n1.  (7, 2): Empty (.).\n2.  (9, 2): H0 body T. Need to check if H0's tail drops off (9, 0) since H0 moved (3, 4)->(3, 5). If H0 does not eat, (9, 0) drops off. (9, 2) remains part of H0's body for now.\n3.  (8, 3): H0 body T. (8, 3) is deep in H0's body.\n\nThe area is heavily saturated with H0's body. I need to move back toward the perimeter or go high/low where H0 is not dominating.\n\nIf H0 moves (3, 4) -> (3, 5) (Empty), their tail (9, 0) drops off.\nFrom (8, 2), I have (7, 2) safe.\nIf I move (8, 2) -> (7, 2), I gain space and avoid the densely packed H0 body to my right and up.\n\nFurther apples are at (9, 7), (8, 9), (7, 6), and the row 9 apples (3, 9, 4, 9, 1, 9, 6, 9, 5, 9). I need to navigate to the Y=9 row.\n\nT55: Move (8, 2) -> (7, 2).\nT56: Move (7, 2) -> (6, 2) or (7, 3) or (7, 1) (neck).\nIf I move down and left, I open up the board for myself.\n\nLet's focus on the move for T54, which is UP.\n\nUP",

SAFE.\n- DOWN to (3, 3): This is my first body segment (my neck). Moving backwards kills me. NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (2, 4): Board shows 'T'. This is enemy body (enemy has (2, 4) in their body). NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (4, 4): Board shows 'T'. This is also enemy body (enemy has (4, 4) in their body). NOT SAFE.\n\nUP to (3, 5) is my only viable move. Let me trace the path forward:\n\nFrom (3, 5), I can only go UP to (3, 6) (LEFT is enemy body at (2, 5), RIGHT is enemy body at (4, 5)).\nFrom (3, 6), I have two apple options: UP to (3, 7) or LEFT to (2, 6). Either path gets me an apple before becoming temporarily trapped.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy head at (8, 1) will likely go UP to (8, 2) for an apple, then LEFT to (7, 2), then LEFT to (6, 2). From (6, 2), the enemy has no safe moves (UP is my body at (6, 3), DOWN is enemy body at (6, 1), LEFT is my body at (5, 2), RIGHT is enemy's neck at (7, 2)). The enemy will die on turn 57, freeing up all the space their body occupied.\n\nBy the time I reach (2, 7) on turn 57, the enemy will be dead and their body will disappear, opening up multiple safe moves for me on turn 58. I'll have 30 apples at that point while the enemy dies with 28.\n\nUP is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy note: After enemy dies on turn 57, I'll have access to the left side of the board which was previously occupied by enemy body. Focus on collecting apples in that region, particularly at (0, 4), (1, 9), (2, 0), and (0, 0).\n\nUP",

Tail: (9, 0) dropped off. Length: 29 + 1 = 30.\n    *   Apples Collected: 29.\n*   **Apples A (14 remaining):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (3, 7), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (0, 4), (8, 9), (0, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (6, 4).\n\nThe immediate goal is to stay safe and secure the next apple, preferably one of the Y=9 apples, as H0 is currently lower down.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 2)):**\n\nCurrent position: (8, 2). Neck: (8, 1).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (8, 3)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body includes (8, 3). | NO    | H0 is blocking the way north. |\n| DOWN | (8, 1)        | My Neck (T)           | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| LEFT | (7, 2)        | Empty (.)             | Check H0 intentions. | YES   | Safe space, opens up. |\n| RIGHT| (9, 2)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body includes (9, 2). | NO    | H0 is blocking the way east. |\n\nOnly LEFT to (7, 2) is immediately safe.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 Head at (3, 5)) and Potential Collisions:**\n\nH0 Head (3, 5). H0 Neck (3, 4).\nH0's adjacent cells:\n*   UP (3, 6): Empty.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): H0 Neck. NO.\n*   LEFT (2, 5): My Body (T). NO.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): My Body (T). NO.\n\nH0 is momentarily constrained. H0 MUST move UP to (3, 6) to survive. (3, 6) is empty.\n\nFuture H0 position: (3, 6).\nFuture H1 position: (7, 2).\n\nGiven H0 is far away and constrained, there is no head-on collision risk with H1 moving LEFT.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 2)):**\n\nI am trapped between my own body to the south and enemy body to the north and east. The only way out is LEFT to (7, 2).\n\nTarget apples: The cluster of apples along Y=9 is the primary long-term target.\nFrom (7, 2), I can aim to move west/northwest to get to these apples while avoiding the densely packed area created by H0 (X=8, 9, Y=3 up to Y=9).\n\nMove sequence from (8, 2):\n1.  T55: (8, 2) -> (7, 2) (LEFT). Safe.\n2.  T56: From (7, 2), I have options:\n    *   (6, 2): Empty (.). Looks safe.\n    *   (7, 1): My body (T). NO.\n    *   (7, 3): H0 body (T). NO.\n    *   (8, 2): My neck. NO.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 2), I am safe and free myself from the immediate trap near the edge.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan:**\nI need to work my way left and up toward the Y=9 apples ((3, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (8, 9)). H0 is moving up the X=3 column (now at (3, 6)), so H0 is likely aiming for (3, 7) (apple) or (3, 9) (apple). I must race them for the top row. Moving LEFT to (7, 2) is the first step in this maneuver.\n\nLEFT",

SAFE.\n- DOWN to (3, 4): This is my first body segment (my neck). Moving backwards kills me. NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (2, 5): Board shows 'T'. This is enemy body (enemy has (2, 5) in their body). NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (4, 5): Board shows 'T'. This is also enemy body (enemy has (4, 5) in their body). NOT SAFE.\n\nUP to (3, 6) is my only viable move. Let me trace the path forward:\n\nFrom (3, 6), I can only go UP to (3, 7) (LEFT is enemy body at (2, 6), RIGHT is enemy body at (4, 6)).\nFrom (3, 6), I can also go LEFT to (2, 6) which has an apple.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy head at (8, 2) will likely go LEFT to (7, 2), then LEFT to (6, 2). From (6, 2), the enemy has no safe moves (UP is my body at (6, 3), DOWN is enemy body at (6, 1), LEFT is my body at (5, 2), RIGHT is enemy's neck at (7, 2)). The enemy will die on turn 57, freeing up all the space their body occupied.\n\nBy the time I reach (2, 7) on turn 57, the enemy will be dead and their body will disappear, opening up multiple safe moves for me on turn 58. I'll have 30 apples at that point while the enemy dies with 28.\n\nUP is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy note: After enemy dies on turn 57, I'll have access to the left side of the board which was previously occupied by enemy body. Focus on collecting apples in that region, particularly at (0, 4), (1, 9), (2, 0), and (0, 0).\n\nUP",

Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 2)):**\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Collision Check | Safe? | Notes |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :-------------: | :---: | :---- |\n| UP   | (7, 3)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body includes (7, 3). | NO    | |\n| DOWN | (7, 1)        | My Body (T)           | Hitting self.   | NO    | |\n| LEFT | (6, 2)        | Empty (.)             | Check H0 intentions. | YES   | Safe space, leads toward central/upper apples. |\n| RIGHT| (8, 2)        | My Neck (T)           | Hitting self (backwards move). | NO | |\n\nOnly LEFT to (6, 2) is immediately safe.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Threat (H0 Head at (3, 6)):**\n\nH0 Head (3, 6). Neck (3, 5).\nH0's adjacent cells:\n*   UP (3, 7): Apple (A). HIGH PRIORITY.\n*   DOWN (3, 5): H0 Neck. NO.\n*   LEFT (2, 6): Apple (A). PRIORITY.\n*   RIGHT (4, 6): My Body (T). NO.\n\nH0 has two strong options: UP to (3, 7) (apple) or LEFT to (2, 6) (apple). Since H0 usually prioritizes moving straight if possible and (3, 7) is an apple, H0 is highly likely to move UP and eat the apple at (3, 7).\n\nIf H0 moves UP to (3, 7), H0's new head is (3, 7).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safety of Moving LEFT (7, 2) -> (6, 2):**\n\nIf H1 moves to (6, 2) and H0 moves to (3, 7):\n*   (6, 2) is empty.\n*   The paths do not cross, and the distance is large (3 units X, 5 units Y). No immediate collision risk.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision and Pathing:**\n\nMy objective is to move upwards and left towards the dense cluster of apples on the Y=9 row. Moving LEFT to (6, 2) is the only safe move and gives me more maneuverability.\n\nFrom (6, 2), my options for turn 57:\n*   UP (6, 3): Enemy Body (T). NO.\n*   DOWN (6, 1): My Body (T). NO.\n*   LEFT (5, 2): Enemy Body (T). NO.\n*   RIGHT (7, 2): My Neck. NO.\n\nWait, if I move to (6, 2), I am immediately trapped! Let me recheck the board contents around (6, 2) *after* my move.\n\nBoard elements around (6, 2):\n*   (6, 3): H0 body part (T).\n*   (6, 1): My body part (T).\n*   (5, 2): H0 body part (T).\n*   (7, 2): My neck (will be (7, 2) if I move away, so moving back is NO).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), I create an immediate dead end for myself for the next turn. I must find a move that allows freedom of movement.\n\nLet's re-examine the collision map carefully:\n\nMy Snake Body: B1 = [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n\nEnemy Snake Body: B0 = [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1)]\n\nH1 current position: (7, 2).\n\nMove LEFT to (6, 2). Safe on Turn 56.\nNeighbors of (6, 2):\n*   (6, 3): B0 (T).\n*   (6, 1): B1 (T).\n*   (5, 2): B0 (T).\n*   (7, 2): H1 previous head position/neck.\n\nYes, (6, 2) is a trap. I cannot move from (7, 2) LEFT.\n\nWait, I only have one safe move: LEFT. If that move leads to a trap, I must take it and hope I can execute a follow-up move that frees me (e.g., if H0 moves or my tail moves).\n\nHowever, if H0 moves UP to (3, 7) and eats, H0 grows. H0's tail will remain at (9, 1).\nMy tail is at (4, 5). If I move, my tail (4, 5) will move to (4, 6). (4, 5) becomes empty.\n\nLet's recheck the trap condition based on tail movement.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2):\nMy new body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)]. Previous tail (4, 5) is now free IF I did not eat. (I did not eat on Turn 55 or 56).\n\nFuture (T57) neighbors of H1 at (6, 2):\n*   UP (6, 3): Still B0 (T).\n*   DOWN (6, 1): Still B1 (T).\n*   LEFT (5, 2): Still B0 (T).\n*   RIGHT (7, 2): Now my neck (T).\n\nYes, (6, 2) is a deadly trap for the next turn. I must find an alternative.\n\nRethink the safe moves for (7, 2):\n1. UP (7, 3): B0 (T). NO.\n2. DOWN (7, 1): B1 (T). NO.\n3. RIGHT (8, 2): B1 (Neck). NO.\n4. LEFT (6, 2): Empty (.). YES.\n\nIf there is only one safe move, I must take it, even if it seems to lead to a trap, unless I can confirm a path out due to tail movement or enemy snake movement.\n\nLet's check the board visual representation again:\n 9 . A . A A A A . A .\n 8 T T T T T T T T T .\n 7 T T . A T T . . T A\n 6 . T A 0 T T . A T T\n 5 . T T T T T T T . T\n 4 A . T T . . A T T T\n 3 . T T T T T T T T T\n 2 . T . . T T . 1 T T <--- H1 (7, 2)\n 1 . T T T . . T T T T\n 0 A A A T T T T . . .\n\nH1 (7, 2).\n(7, 3) is T (B0).\n(7, 1) is T (B1).\n(8, 2) is T (B1 Neck).\n(6, 2) is (.).\n\nIt seems I genuinely have only one option: LEFT to (6, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT, I must rely on H0 moving away from (6, 3) or (5, 2), or my own tail freeing up a space.\n\nMy tail will free up (4, 5). This is too far away to help me at (6, 2).\n\nH0 is at (3, 6). If H0 moves UP to (3, 7). H0's tail remains at (9, 1).\nH0 is trapped in a vertical line near the center of the board, forming a barrier.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), I am stuck. This means I will die on Turn 57 unless I get lucky geometry changes.\n\nLet's assume the game expects me to choose the move that keeps me alive for *this* turn.\n\nWhat if H0 blocks my only move?\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (4, 6)? This is my body (T). H0 dies. Unlikely move.\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (2, 6)? Apple. H0 eats.\nIf H0 moves UP to (3, 7)? Apple. H0 eats. (Most likely).\n\nIf H0 goes to (3, 7):\nH0 body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), ...]\nThe barrier around (6, 2) remains: (6, 3) B0, (5, 2) B0.\n\nSince I have no other choice and the rules require me to choose a safe move if one exists, I must choose LEFT.\n\nLong-Term Strategy (T57): Pray for an opening. The only possible opening would be if H0 moves such that (6, 3) or (5, 2) becomes free, or if I successfully pull off a complex diagonal chase if I had two steps available. Since I only have one, I am likely facing self-strangulation on T57.\n\nIf (6, 3) frees up, I can move UP.\nIf (5, 2) frees up, I can move LEFT.\n\nH0's body sections at (6, 3) and (5, 2) are deep inside H0's current path, meaning H0 won't vacate them unless H0 is forced to move rapidly, making its tail catch up, which is not happening since H0 is eating apples and growing.\n\nThis is a forced suicide sequence, but LEFT is the only non-instant death move.\n\nLEFT",

Safe move (not in my body, not in enemy body).\n- DOWN to (3, 5): This is my first body segment (my neck). Moving backwards kills me. NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (2, 6): Board shows 'A' at (2, 6) - that's an apple. Safe move.\n- RIGHT to (4, 6): Board shows 'T' at (4, 6) - enemy body (enemy has (4, 6) in their body). NOT SAFE.\n\nSo I have two safe moves: UP to (3, 7) for an apple, or LEFT to (2, 6) for an apple.\n\nLet me analyze both paths:\n\n**Path 1: UP to (3, 7)**\n- Eat apple at (3, 7), reach 30 apples.\n- From (3, 7), only LEFT to (2, 7) is safe on turn 57 (enemy still alive).\n- From (2, 7) on turn 58 (enemy dies on turn 57), I have 3 safe moves: UP to (2, 8), DOWN to (2, 6) with an apple, LEFT to (1, 7).\n\n**Path 2: LEFT to (2, 6)**\n- Eat apple at (2, 6), reach 30 apples.\n- From (2, 6), only UP to (2, 7) is safe on turn 57.\n- From (2, 7) on turn 58, I have only 2 safe moves: UP to (2, 8), LEFT to (1, 7). DOWN to (2, 6) is now my neck.\n\nBoth paths get me 1 apple this turn. Path 1 gives more future options (3 vs 2 safe moves on turn 58) and allows me to eat another apple at (2, 6) on turn 58.\n\nEnemy analysis: Enemy at (7, 2) can only move LEFT to (6, 2) to stay alive. From (6, 2), all 4 moves lead to death (blocked by my body or their own). Enemy dies on turn 57 regardless.\n\nUP is the better choice.\n\nStrategy note: After enemy dies on turn 57, the left side of the board opens up. From (2, 7) on turn 58, I can eat the apple at (2, 6), then continue collecting apples in the newly freed region: (0, 4), (1, 9), (2, 0), and (0, 0).\n\nUP",

Tail: (4, 6).\n    *   Apples Collected: 28.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (3, 7). Moved UP last turn (from (3, 6)), ate an apple (3, 7).\n    *   Body length: 31 (grew by 1). Tail: (9, 1).\n    *   Apples Collected: 30.\n*   **Apples A (14 remaining):** (9, 7), (3, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (2, 6), (0, 4), (8, 9), (0, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (6, 4), (0, 3) (Wait, the apple list provided at the start of Turn 57's input is 15 apples. (3, 7) was consumed by H0, so one apple should be gone. Let's rely on the environment map, which shows 14 remaining apples after (3, 7) was consumed.)\n\nBoard state (visual inspection to confirm locations):\nH1 is at (6, 2). Neck is (7, 2).\nH0 is at (3, 7). Neck is (3, 6).\n\nThe last rationale correctly identified that moving to (6, 2) would lead to a trap if H0 maintained its body positions. H0 ate an apple and grew, so the trap likely remains. We must verify potential escapes.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (6, 2)):**\n\nMy current body (excluding head): [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)].\n\nEnemy Body (new, grew by 1): [(3, 6), (3, 5), ..., (9, 1)]. (H0 is now (3, 7), so the neck is (3, 6)).\nThe enemy body segments forming the trap boundaries were (6, 3) and (5, 2). These are deep in H0's body and are still occupied.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Content (Board check) | Notes | Safe? |\n| :--- | :-----------: | :-------------------- | :---- | :---: |\n| UP   | (6, 3)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body part at (6, 3). No change. | NO    |\n| DOWN | (6, 1)        | My Body (T)           | Hitting self. | NO    |\n| LEFT | (5, 2)        | Enemy Body (T)        | H0 body part at (5, 2). No change. | NO    |\n| RIGHT| (7, 2)        | My Neck (T)           | Backwards move. | NO |\n\n**CRITICAL FINDING:** There are **NO** safe moves for Snake 1. I am dead this turn by self-strangulation/enemy body collision.\n\nIf there are no safe moves, the game logic suggests choosing the most favorable move, but all lead to immediate death.\n\nLet's carefully verify the board and snake lists one last time to ensure no segment was released that could provide an escape.\n\nMy Head: (6, 2).\nMy Tail (after move 56, before move 57): (4, 6).\nSince I did not eat on Turn 56 (moved (7, 2) -> (6, 2)), my tail (4, 6) will be released and (4, 7) will become my new tail segment *if* I were to make a valid move. This is far from (6, 2).\n\nThe cells surrounding (6, 2):\n(6, 3): Is in B0: (6, 3) is the 9th segment of H0. It is fixed.\n(6, 1): Is in B1: (6, 1) is the 5th segment of H1. It is fixed.\n(5, 2): Is in B0: (5, 2) is the 7th segment of H0. It is fixed.\n(7, 2): Is in B1: (7, 2) is the neck. Fixed.\n\nI am 100% trapped.\n\n**What happens if I choose a move?**\nIf I choose UP to (6, 3): Collision with Snake 0 body -> I die.\nIf I choose DOWN to (6, 1): Collision with my own body -> I die.\nIf I choose LEFT to (5, 2): Collision with Snake 0 body -> I die.\nIf I choose RIGHT to (7, 2): Collision with my own neck -> I die.\n\nSince the game requires an output and all moves lead to death, I must select one. In such highly unusual scenarios, some implementations might favor collisions with the enemy over self-collision, or vice versa, but typically, the goal is to prolong life. Since 100% death is imminent, the choice is arbitrary from a survival perspective. I will choose UP, attempting to force a path toward the high-value apples, even though it results in immediate death by collision with Snake 0.\n\nBy selecting UP, I collide with H0's body (6, 3).\n\nFinal Decision: UP (resulting in intentional collision since no safe move exists).\nUP",
