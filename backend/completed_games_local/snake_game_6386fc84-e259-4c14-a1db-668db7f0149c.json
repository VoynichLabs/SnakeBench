The apple at (6, 2) is 4 cells to the right - I can reach it by moving RIGHT to (3, 2), then RIGHT to (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)\n2. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) would move away from all apples\n3. The enemy is likely to move UP to (9, 9) to eat that apple, so it won't be a threat on the right side\n4. The apple at (5, 7) is also reachable but would take more moves to get there\n5. The apple at (5, 4) is closer - 2 cells up and 3 cells to the right\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): Safe, moves toward the closest apple (6, 2), avoids enemy\n- DOWN to (2, 1): Safe but moves away from all apples\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should move RIGHT to (3, 2) to get closer to the apple at (6, 2). This will position me to eat that apple in the next few moves. After eating the apple, I'll be at (6, 2) with my body extending to (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), and (1, 2). From there, I can consider my next move to eat another apple - the closest remaining apple would be (5, 4) which is 2 cells up. I should be careful to avoid the enemy snake which is at (9, 8) and might be moving closer.\n\nRIGHT",
