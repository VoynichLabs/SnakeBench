Check if (7,3) is occupied by any snake body or head? \n  - No snake body segment at (7,3) (my body is empty, enemy body is empty).\n  - No enemy head at (7,3) (enemy head is at (4,1)).\n  - Not off-board. So safe.\n- DOWN to (7,1): Safe? \n  - Not occupied by any body or enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,2): Safe? \n  - Not occupied. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (8,2): Safe? \n  - Not occupied. Safe.\n\nSo all four moves are currently safe.\n\nStrategy:\n- I want to eat apples efficiently while avoiding head-on collisions.\n- Apples: (8,1) is close to me (distance: |8-7| + |1-2| = 1+1=2). The next closest apple is (9,0) (distance 2+2=4), then (9,3) (distance 2+1=3), (9,4) (distance 2+2=4), (7,7) (distance 0+5=5).\n- Enemy snake is at (4,1). It might also target (8,1) or (9,0) or (9,3).\n- I should move towards (8,1) to try to get it before the enemy. But I must avoid a head-on collision if the enemy also moves towards it.\n\nEnemy's possible moves from (4,1):\n- UP to (4,2)\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n- RIGHT to (5,1)\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,2), I'm moving towards (8,1) but not directly into it yet. Safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,1), I'm moving towards (8,1) but not directly into it. Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,2), I'm moving away from the nearest apple. Not optimal.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,3), I'm moving away from the nearest apple. Not optimal.\n\nSo I should choose between RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nWhich is better?\n- Moving DOWN to (7,1) puts me one step closer to (8,1) in the y-direction. From (7,1), I can move RIGHT to (8,1) next turn to eat the apple if it's still there.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,2) puts me one step closer in the x-direction. From (8,2), I can move DOWN to (8,1) next turn.\n\nBoth are good. But I must consider the enemy's possible move.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,1), then it's closer to (8,1) (distance: 3 in x, 0 in y = 3). If I move DOWN to (7,1), I'm at distance 1 in x and 0 in y = 1. So I'm closer and will get there first if I move DOWN now and then RIGHT next.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT twice in a row, it will be at (6,1) after two turns. Then distance to (8,1) is 2. I would be at (8,1) after two turns if I go DOWN then RIGHT. So I get it.\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (4,2) or DOWN to (4,0), it's moving away from (8,1), so I'm safe.\n\nThus, moving DOWN to (7,1) is a good immediate step towards (8,1). It's safe and positions me well.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n1) Move DOWN to (7,1).\n2) Next turn, if (8,1) is still there, move RIGHT to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n3) After eating, my body will be [(7,1), (7,2)] (head at (8,1), body at (7,1), tail at (7,2)). Then I can consider moving towards (9,0) or (9,3) while avoiding the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Thinking out loud:\n\n1.  **Current State**:\n    *   My head: $(4, 1)$.\n    *   Enemy Snake #0: Head at $(8, 1)$, Body at $(7, 1)$.\n    *   Apples: $(9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (7, 7), (2, 0)$. There is no apple at $(5, 1)$ or $(4, 0)$ or $(3, 1)$.\n    *   Board edges: $x=0$ to $9$, $y=0$ to $9$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Moves**:\n    *   **DOWN**: Move to $(4, 0)$. This is on the board. It is empty. Safe immediately.\n    *   **UP**: Move to $(4, 2)$. This is on the board. It is empty. Safe immediately.\n    *   **LEFT**: Move to $(3, 1)$. This is on the board. It is empty. Safe immediately.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Move to $(5, 1)$. This is on the board. It is empty. However, checking the enemy: Snake #0's head is at $(8, 1)$ and tail at $(7, 1)$. Snake #0 moves next. If Snake #0 moves LEFT, it will go to $(7, 1)$? No, its head is at $(8, 1)$. If it moves LEFT, it goes to $(7, 1)$. Wait, $(7, 1)$ is its own tail. So Snake #0 cannot move LEFT (backward). Snake #0 can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n        *   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, it goes to $(9, 1)$. Then $(5, 1)$ is safe for me.\n        *   If Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to $(8, 2)$.\n        *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN, it goes to $(8, 0)$.\n        *   Actually, since Snake #0's body is at $(7, 1)$, moving to $(7, 1)$ is invalid for Snake #0.\n        *   Wait, looking at the board state: `1 . . . 1 . . T 0 .` at y=1. Snake #0's body is at `(7, 1)` marked as 'T' (tail?), but the text says `Head: (8, 1), Body: [(7, 1)]`. So the head is at `0` (col 8) and tail at `T` (col 7).\n        *   Snake #0 cannot move into $(7, 1)$ because it is its own body.\n        *   Snake #0 can move to $(9, 1)$, $(8, 0)$, or $(8, 2)$.\n        *   So $(5, 1)$ is safe from immediate collision with Snake #0 *this turn*, provided I don't move there and they don't move there.\n        *   However, $(5, 1)$ leads me closer to Snake #0. And there are no apples there. It's a \"dead end\" in terms of progress. I am heading towards an enemy for no gain.\n        *   Also, the last move rationale mentioned \"If I move RIGHT to (5,0)\"... wait, I am at $(4, 1)$. To move RIGHT goes to $(5, 1)$. The rationale mentioned $(5, 0)$. That would be DOWN-RIGHT or something incorrect? Or maybe I was at a different spot previously. Regardless, based on my current $(4, 1)$:\n            *   Moving RIGHT to $(5, 1)$ moves me closer to the enemy at $(8, 1)$. While not immediately deadly, it reduces safety margin and doesn't help me get apples. The closest apples are $(2, 0)$ (Left/Down) and $(9, 0)$ (Right/Down). The apple at $(9, 0)$ is far right. The apple at $(2, 0)$ is left.\n            *   The apple at $(9, 0)$ is 5 steps right and 1 step down. The apple at $(2, 0)$ is 2 steps left and 1 step down.\n            *   I should avoid moving towards the enemy.\n\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   **LEFT (to (3, 1))**: Moves towards apple at $(2, 0)$. Keeps options open. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to (4, 0))**: Moves towards apple at $(2, 0)$ (diagonally). Safe. Also moves towards $(9, 0)$ if I go right later, but Left/Down seems better for $(2, 0)$.\n    *   **UP (to (4, 2))**: Moves away from all current apples. Safe, but leads to the center where there are no apples shown yet (except at y=7). I am at y=1. Moving up puts me at y=2. The nearest apples are at y=0. So UP is moving away from goals.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (5, 1))**: Moves towards the enemy. Bad.\n\n    So the choice is between LEFT and DOWN.\n    Target: $(2, 0)$ is the closest apple.\n    From $(4, 1)$:\n    To go to $(2, 0)$: Next step should ideally be $(3, 0)$ or $(2, 1)$.\n    - Move LEFT to $(3, 1)$: Then next turn I can go DOWN to $(3, 0)$ or LEFT to $(2, 1)$. This keeps both options open.\n    - Move DOWN to $(4, 0)$: Then next turn I can go LEFT to $(3, 0)$ (closer) or RIGHT (towards enemy). This restricts me to going left to make progress.\n\n    Moving LEFT to $(3, 1)$ seems slightly more flexible as it doesn't put me on the edge immediately. However, both are valid.\n    Let's look at the \"last move\" info again. The bot previously moved UP from somewhere (maybe (4,0) or (4,1)?) because it wanted to go to $(4,4)$. But $(4,4)$ has no apple. The apple at $(4,4)$ was mentioned in the last rationale, but the apples list provided now is: $(7, 7), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (2, 0)$. There is NO apple at $(4, 4)$.\n    So the previous bot's rationale was based on a false belief about an apple at $(4,4)$. I must correct this.\n    The visible apples are at $(2,0)$ and $(9,0)$ on the bottom row.\n    I should move towards $(2,0)$ because it is closer (distance 3) than $(9,0)$ (distance 6).\n    \n    Options to reach $(2,0)$:\n    - Left to $(3,1)$ -> Down to $(3,0)$ -> Left to $(2,0)$.\n    - Down to $(4,0)$ -> Left to $(3,0)$ -> Left to $(2,0)$.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to $(4,0)$, I am on the bottom row. The enemy snake head is at $(8,1)$. If the enemy moves DOWN to $(8,0)$, I am at $(4,0)$. There is distance. If I go LEFT to $(3,1)$, I am one row up.\n    \n    Let's check if any move is unsafe.\n    - **LEFT (3,1)**: Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN (4,0)**: Empty. Safe.\n    - **UP (4,2)**: Empty. Safe but bad direction.\n    - **RIGHT (5,1)**: Empty. Safe but bad direction (towards enemy).\n    \n    I will choose **LEFT**. It moves me towards the nearest apple $(2,0)$ and keeps me one row away from the edge, offering slightly more mobility (I can go Down or Left next turn). If I go Down to $(4,0)$, I am forced to go Left to make progress (going Right is towards enemy).\n\n    **Plan**: Move towards the apple at $(2,0)$.\n\n    **Long-term Plan**: Go to $(2,0)$, then maybe $(9,0)$ or $(9,3)$ depending on enemy movement. Avoid Snake #0.\n\n    Check for head-on collisions:\n    - My move: LEFT to $(3,1)$.\n    - Enemy #0: Currently at $(8,1)$. Can move to $(9,1), (8,0), (8,2)$.\n    - None of these are $(3,1)$. So no head-on collision.\n    \n    Check for moving into body:\n    - Enemy body at $(7,1)$. I am at $(3,1)$. Safe.\n    - My body: none.\n\n    This seems correct.\n\n    Final check on the \"backward move\" rule: If I were at $(3,1)$ next turn, I could move RIGHT to $(4,1)$ (current pos). That's not illegal *unless* my body fills it. My body is empty. So it's fine.\n    \n    Choice: LEFT.\n\n    One detail: The enemy has an apple at $(9,0)$. They are at $(8,1)$. They might go DOWN to $(8,0)$ and then RIGHT to $(9,0)$. That doesn't interfere with me at $(3,1)$.\n\n    Another detail: Apple at $(9,3)$ and $(9,4)$. Enemy is at $(8,1)$. They might go UP to chase those.\n    \n    Staying away from the enemy is the priority if I can't eat an apple immediately. But I can eat an apple soon by going left.\n\n    Final move: LEFT.\n\n    **Wait**: The board map shows:\n    `1 . . . 1 . . T 0 .`\n    The '1' at (4,1) is me.\n    The '0' at (8,1) is enemy head.\n    The 'T' at (7,1) is enemy tail.\n    \n    My target (2,0) is at bottom left.\n    From (4,1), moving LEFT brings me closer.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Wall\" at x=0, y=0.\n    If I go DOWN to (4,0), I am on the wall.\n    If I go LEFT to (3,1), I am not on the wall.\n    Being on the wall limits moves (cannot go DOWN). Being 1 row off the wall allows all 4 moves (if space permits).\n    So (3,1) is positionally superior to (4,0).\n    \n    Therefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\n    One check: Is there an apple at (4,4)? No.\n    Is there an apple at (5,0)? No.\n    Is there an apple at (8,1)? No, that is the enemy head.\n    \n    The apples are listed clearly.\n    I will move LEFT.\n\n    Wait, the previous bot thought there was an apple at (4,4). I must ignore that.\n    \n    Summary of reasoning:\n    1. Identify targets: (2,0) is closest.\n    2. Identify enemies: (8,1) is far but relevant.\n    3. Evaluate moves:\n       - UP: Away from target.\n       - RIGHT: Towards enemy, away from target.\n       - DOWN: Towards target, but on wall.\n       - LEFT: Towards target, not on wall.\n    4. Decision: LEFT.\n\n    Just to be absolutely sure about collision:\n    Enemy #0 moves.\n    If Enemy #0 moves DOWN: (8,0).\n    If Enemy #0 moves UP: (8,2).\n    If Enemy #0 moves RIGHT: (9,1).\n    I move LEFT: (3,1).\n    No overlap.\n\n    What if Enemy #0 moves LEFT?\n    (8,1) -> (7,1).\n    But (7,1) is its own tail. The rule says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    So Enemy #0 cannot move LEFT. It is trapped from moving left.\n    \n    So I am safe.\n\n    Final decision: LEFT.\n\n    Long-term plan: Go to (2,0) to eat the apple. Then look at (9,0) or go up to (9,3)/(9,4). Monitor enemy at (8,1).\n\n    I will output \"LEFT\".\n\n    One final check. Is there any snake at (3,1)? No. Is it off board? No.\n    Is it backwards into my own body? I have no body. So no.\n    Is it into another snake's body? Enemy body is at (7,1). So no.\n\n    All clear.\n\n    Output \"LEFT\".\n\n    *Self-Correction*:\n    The user prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    So I should write the plan.\n    \n    Plan: Move LEFT to (3,1) to approach the apple at (2,0). Avoid the enemy at (8,1).\n\n    Final Move: LEFT.\n\n    Wait, I should check if (3,0) is occupied. It is not. I can't move there this turn, but I will next turn.\n    If I move LEFT to (3,1), I am safe.\n\n    Correct.\n\n    One edge case: What if the enemy moves to (7,1)? No, that's suicide.\n    \n    All set.\n\n    I will write the reasoning and then the move.\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n    I must ensure I don't add extra lines after the move.\n    The plan is usually written *before* the final move line.\n\n    Example structure:\n    <Thinking/Rationale>\n    <Plan>\n    MOVE\n\n    I will do that.\n\n    Plan:\n    Move LEFT to (3,1) to approach the apple at (2,0). Keep distance from enemy at (8,1).\n\n    Wait, I should double check the coordinate system.\n    \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    Y increases going UP. X increases going RIGHT.\n    My head (4,1).\n    (2,0) is LEFT and DOWN from (4,1).\n    So moving LEFT gets me closer to X=2. Moving DOWN gets me closer to Y=0.\n    The prompt says \"LEFT\" decreases X. So I am correct.\n\n    The prompt says \"Your last move information: ... UP\".\n    The bot previously moved UP to (4,2) or (4,1)? The text says \"UP\" and rationale says \"Moving UP is the best choice to reach it\". It was at (4,1) and moved UP to (4,2)? Or it was at (4,0) and moved UP to (4,1)?\n    Actually, looking at the board state:\n    `1 . . . 1 . . T 0 .`\n    The '1' (me) is at x=4, y=1.\n    The previous move was \"UP\".\n    If I was at (4,0) and moved UP, I am now at (4,1).\n    If I was at (4,1) and moved UP, I would be at (4,2).\n    Given the board shows me at (4,1), and the move was UP, it implies I was at (4,0) previously.\n    But wait, the board shows `0 . . A . . . . . . A` at y=0.\n    At x=4, y=0, it is `.`.\n    So I was likely at (4,0) and moved UP to (4,1).\n    This confirms I am currently at (4,1).\n\n    So my analysis stands.\n\n    Target: (2,0).\n    Path: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0).\n    Or (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0).\n    \n    (3,1) is safer than (4,0) because (3,1) allows movement in 4 directions (mostly), while (4,0) (bottom edge) restricts movement.\n\n    Move: LEFT.\n\n    I must not mention future directions *after* the final move word.\n    \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n    So I will write the plan, then the move.\n\n    Plan: Move LEFT towards the apple at (2,0).\n    Move: LEFT\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\n    If I put \"Move: LEFT\", that is not one word.\n    It must be just \"LEFT\".\n    And \"Do not add anything after that word\".\n    So I should not put \"LEFT.\" or \"LEFT\\n\". Just \"LEFT\".\n    Actually, the prompt usually implies a newline is fine, but no extra text.\n    I will output \"LEFT\" on the last line.\n\n    I will include the reasoning and plan in the text above.\n\n    One more check on the \"directly backwards\" rule.\n    If I move LEFT to (3,1), and later want to move RIGHT, that goes to (4,1).\n    Is (4,1) part of my body?\n    Currently my body is none.\n    So if I move LEFT to (3,1), my body becomes [(4,1)].\n    Then next turn, moving RIGHT to (4,1) is moving into my own body.\n    That would be suicide.\n    So I must remember not to move backwards.\n    \n    What if I move DOWN to (4,0)?\n    My body becomes [(4,1)].\n    Next turn moving UP is suicide.\n    This is standard snake mechanics.\n\n    Is there any threat that forces me to turn backwards? No.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    `1 . . . 1 . . T 0 .`\n    Enemy at 8.\n    Me at 4.\n    Space between is empty.\n    \n    I am safe.\n\n    Final confirmation of the move:\n    Current: (4,1).\n    Target: (2,0).\n    Options: LEFT, DOWN.\n    LEFT (3,1) is better than DOWN (4,0).\n\n    Correct.\n\n    One detail: The apple at (9,0) is at bottom right.\n    If I go LEFT, I am going away from (9,0).\n    But (9,0) is far. (2,0) is close.\n    Closest apple is always the priority early game.\n    \n    Okay.\n\n    I will generate the responseMoving LEFT towards the apple at (2,0) is the safest and most efficient play. I am currently at (4,1), and the apple at (2,0) is the closest visible target. Moving LEFT to (3,1) brings me closer to this apple while avoiding the immediate danger of the enemy snake at (8,1) and keeping me off the bottom edge of the board to maintain mobility. Moving DOWN to (4,0) would put me on the edge and is less flexible. Moving RIGHT towards the enemy or UP away from all apples are inefficient choices.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (3,1) to approach the apple at (2,0). Avoid the enemy at (8,1).\n\nLEFT",

(3,-1) is off board (y must be 0-9). **DOWN is invalid.**\n*   **Self Collision:**\n    *   LEFT moves to (2,0), which is currently my body.

By the time I move, the tail will move forward to (2,0) -> (3,0)? No. My current body is [(2,0)]. This means (2,0) is occupied.\n    *   Wait, let's look at the board state provided: \"0 . . T 1 . . . 0 T T\". This corresponds to y=0. At x=2 there is 'T' (my tail), at x=3 there is '1' (my head).\n    *   My body is `[(2,0)]`. The head is `(3,0)`.\n    *   **LEFT** to (2,0): The current body is at (2,0). Is this the tail? Yes, the tail is (2,0). Since the tail moves every turn, moving into the current tail position is valid (the tail will move away).\n    *   **UP** to (3,1): Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (4,0): Empty.\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Snake #0 Head: (7,0), Body: [(8,0), (9,0)].\n    *   My potential heads: (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n    *   None of these are occupied by Snake #0.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP (3,1):** Moves towards the center. Open space.\n*   **LEFT (2,0):** Moves back to tail. No immediate benefit, limits forward momentum.\n*   **RIGHT (4,0):** Moves right. Open space.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (2, 5) is directly UP from my position (3,0).

They are on the bottom row (y=0) at x=7,8,9.\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **UP (3,1):** This is a great move. It moves me off the bottom wall (y=0) into the open board. It puts me directly below the apple at (2,5). From (3,1), I have access to the whole board. It avoids the enemy snake entirely.\n    *   **RIGHT (4,0):** This keeps me on the bottom wall. While moving towards the central apples, I am moving horizontally towards the enemy snake (at x=7). The bottom row is becoming crowded (Enemy at 7,8,9).\n    *   **LEFT (2,0):** Moves to the tail.

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP (5, 2):** Moves deeper into the board. Opens up access to the apple at (2,5) and (7,7).\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):** Moves back to the bottom wall. This is a safe survival move if walls are dangerous, but limits future movement.\n*   **LEFT (4, 1):** Moves slightly left, towards the apple at (2,5).\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Moves towards the enemy snake #0. Enemy head is at (7,3). Moving to (6,1) creates distance but heads towards the general area of the enemy.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Objective:** Reach apples.

While currently safe, it's strategic to move away from the opponent to avoid future collisions.\n    *   **DOWN:** Back to the wall. Avoidable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the best choice.

They probably need to move UP to (3,2).\n\n**Mobility**: I have good mobility with three safe directions available. Moving UP gets me closer to (7,7) and (9,3/4). Moving LEFT could compete for (2,5). Moving RIGHT could help get to (9,3/4).\n\n**Path analysis**:\n- (7,7): Direct path UP from my current position - I can continue straight up to get there\n- (9,3/4): From (7,5), I could go RIGHT to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,3)\n- (2,5): This is to my left and up, but would require competing with enemy who's closer\n- (0,3): Far left, not a priority\n\n**Enemy movement prediction**: Enemy at (3,1) likely needs to move UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1). If they go UP, they're heading toward (2,5) area. If they go LEFT, they're moving toward the left side.\n\n**Long-term strategy**: I'm in a good position to claim (7,7) apple by continuing UP. This is the most direct path. Enemy is on the left side, so I should focus on the right side apples (9,3) and (9,4) after getting (7,7).\n\n**Move Selection**\n\n**UP** to (7,6) is the best choice because:\n- It's safe and keeps all future options open\n- It continues my direct path toward the (7,7) apple\n- It avoids potential conflicts with the enemy who's likely to move toward the left side of the board\n- It positions me to easily reach (9,3) and (9,4) later if needed\n\nUP",

My Body is (2, 2).\nI must check immediate threats.\n\n1.  **Self Collision (Backwards):**\n    Moving DOWN to (2, 2) puts my head where my body currently is. Since my body is directly below my head, moving DOWN is illegal (suicide) and would result in death. So DOWN is out.\n\n2.  **Board Boundaries:**\n    - UP: (2, 4). Valid.\n    - LEFT: (1, 3). Valid.\n    - RIGHT: (3, 3). Valid.\n    - DOWN: (2, 2). Valid coordinate, but illegal move (body).\n\n3.  **Enemy Snakes:**\n    Enemy Snake #0:\n    - Head: (6, 7)\n    - Body: (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)\n\n    Potential Head-on Collisions:\n    - If Enemy #0 moves UP to (6, 8), I am safe.\n    - If Enemy #0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), I am safe.\n    - If Enemy #0 moves LEFT to (5, 7), I am safe.\n    - If Enemy #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 7), I am safe.\n\n    Let's check my potential moves against Enemy #0's current body:\n    - UP (2, 4): Safe.\n    - LEFT (1, 3): Safe.\n    - RIGHT (3, 3): Safe.\n\n4.  **Apples:**\n    Apples at: (9, 3), (9, 4), (0, 3), (2, 5), (1, 7).\n    My Head: (2, 3).\n    - UP (2, 4): Not an apple. But it gets me closer to (2, 5) (Distance: 1).\n    - LEFT (1, 3): Not an apple. Gets me closer to (0, 3) (Distance: 1).\n    - RIGHT (3, 3): Not an apple.\n\n5.  **Future Options (Trapping):**\n    - **UP to (2, 4):**\n        - New Head: (2, 4). New Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2)].\n        - Next moves from (2, 4):\n            - UP (2, 5): Apple! Safe.\n            - DOWN (2, 3): Body. Safe? No, (2, 3) will be the first body segment. Collision. DEAD.\n            - LEFT (1, 4): Empty? Diagram shows Row 4: `. . . . . . . . . A`. Yes, empty. Safe.\n            - RIGHT (3, 4): Empty. Safe.\n        - **Count safe exits:** 3 (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good.\n\n    - **LEFT to (1, 3):**\n        - New Head: (1, 3). New Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2)].\n        - Next moves from (1, 3):\n            - UP (1, 4): Empty. Safe.\n            - DOWN (1, 2): Empty? Diagram Row 1: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Yes. Safe.\n            - LEFT (0, 3): Apple! Safe.\n            - RIGHT (2, 3): Body. Collision. DEAD.\n        - **Count safe exits:** 3 (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good.\n\n    - **RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n        - New Head: (3, 3). New Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2)].\n        - Next moves from (3, 3):\n            - UP (3, 4): Empty. Safe.\n            - DOWN (3, 2): Empty? Diagram Row 2: `. . T . . . . . . .`. Wait, Body is (2,2). (3,2) is empty. Safe.\n            - LEFT (2, 3): Body. Collision. DEAD.\n            - RIGHT (4, 3): Empty. Safe.\n        - **Count safe exits:** 3 (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP (2, 4):**\n    - Moves towards apple at (2, 5). Distance to apple becomes 1.\n    - Future options: 3 safe moves.\n- **LEFT (1, 3):**\n    - Moves towards apple at (0, 3). Distance to apple becomes 1.\n    - Future options: 3 safe moves.\n- **RIGHT (3, 3):**\n    - Does not move towards any apple immediately (closest are (2,5) or (9,3)). Distance to (2,5) increases to 2.\n    - Future options: 3 safe moves.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are strong choices as they both approach an apple with good future options. However, the apple at (2, 5) is vertically aligned with my current position, making it a very direct path. The apple at (0, 3) requires a LEFT turn. Both are distance 2 away currently.\n\nLet's look at the long term. The snake #0 is at (6, 7). It is far away. The apple at (2, 5) is very close.\nIf I go UP now to (2, 4), next turn I can go UP to (2, 5) and eat the apple. This will extend my tail and keep me in that vertical column.\n\nThe reasoning from the last turn selected UP to get from (2,2) to (2,3). Continuing UP is consistent and gets the apple.\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (2, 4) to align with the apple at (2, 5). Eat it next turn. Then evaluate the board from (2, 5). Avoid moving down into my own body chain.\n\nUP",

This would kill me\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n\n### Immediate threats\n- RIGHT hits my body. UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all safe.\n\n### Apple priorities\n- (1,7) is to my left - I can get there by going LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)\n- (9,3) and (9,4) are to my right and down\n- (2,5) is to my left and down - enemy is closer to this\n- (0,3) is far left and down\n\n### Enemy position\nEnemy is at (2,4) with body at (2,3). From their position, they have safe moves: UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,4), or RIGHT to (3,4). They cannot move DOWN to (2,2) as that would be into their own body.\n\n### Mobility\nI have good mobility with three safe directions available. Moving LEFT gets me closer to (1,7) which is the closest apple to me.\n\n### Path analysis\n- (1,7): From (5,7), I can go LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), (2,7), (1,7) - 4 moves total\n- (9,3/4): From (5,7), I would go DOWN to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3) - 8 moves total\n- (2,5): Enemy is closer to this apple and can reach it in 1 move\n- (0,3): Far left, not a priority for me\n\n### Enemy movement prediction\nEnemy at (2,4) likely needs to move UP to (2,5) to get that apple, LEFT to (1,4), or RIGHT to (3,4). They're probably looking to get to (2,5) or (0,3).\n\n### Long-term strategy\nI should move LEFT toward (1,7) since it's the closest apple to me and I can reach it without competing with the enemy. This will give me 4 apples total. After that, I can focus on the right side apples (9,3) and (9,4) or return to the left side if needed.\n\n### Move Selection\n\n**LEFT** to (4,7) is the best choice because:\n- It's safe and positions me to reach (1,7) in 3 more moves\n- (1,7) is the closest apple to me\n- The enemy is not competing for this apple\n- It maintains good mobility for future moves\n- It's a strategic move that doesn't commit me to a dead-end path\n\nLEFT",

(Apple at 0,6, Snake 1 head at 2,6)\nRow 5: . . T . . . . . . .  (Snake 1 body at 2,5)\nRow 4: . . T . . . . . . A  (Snake 1 body at 2,4, Apple at 9,4)\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . A  (Apples at 0,3 and 9,3)\n\nSnake #0 is at head (3, 7) with body [(4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)].\n\n**Evaluating moves from (2, 6):**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 7):**\n   - Is (2, 7) within board? Yes (x=2, y=7).\n   - Is (2, 7) part of my body? My body is at (2,5) and (2,4). No.\n   - Is (2, 7) part of enemy #0 body? Enemy body is at (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). No.\n   - Is (2, 7) where enemy #0 head is? Enemy head is at (3,7). No.\n   - **Result: SAFE.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 5):**\n   - My body is at (2, 5). Moving into my own body is death.\n   - **Result: UNSAFE (DEATH).**\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6):**\n   - Is (1, 6) within board? Yes.\n   - Is (1, 6) part of my body? No.\n   - Is (1, 6) part of enemy #0 body? No.\n   - Is (1, 6) where enemy #0 head is? No.\n   - **Result: SAFE.**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6):**\n   - Is (3, 6) within board? Yes.\n   - Is (3, 6) part of my body? No.\n   - Is (3, 6) part of enemy #0 body? No.\n   - Is (3, 6) where enemy #0 head is? No (Enemy head is at (3,7)).\n   - **Result: SAFE.**\n\nSo I have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **UP (2,7):** This puts me directly below Snake #0's head (at 3,7) and to the left of its body (4,7...). This is very dangerous. If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (3,6), we would be adjacent. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2,7), we collide. I should avoid this zone.\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** This moves me towards the center/right side. There are apples at (9,3) and (9,4). However, Snake #0 is at (3,7) above. If I go Right, I am next to the enemy snake's head position.\n- **LEFT (1,6):** This moves me towards the apples at (0,3), (0,6). From (1,6), I can go DOWN to (1,5) then DOWN to (1,4) then LEFT to (0,4) and DOWN to (0,3). Or I can go LEFT to (0,6) directly next turn. This direction is relatively clear. Enemy #0 is far away to the right.\n\nComparing the threats:\n- **UP:** High risk of collision with Snake #0 (it is right there).\n- **RIGHT:** Moderate risk (moves closer to Snake #0, potentially restricting movement).\n- **LEFT:** Lowest risk. It moves away from Snake #0 and towards available apples.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the optimal move to ensure survival and pursue apples.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (1,6) to distance myself from Snake #0 and approach the apples at (0,6) and (0,3). Next turn, aim for (0,6) or descend towards (0,3).\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

This would kill me\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n#### Immediate threats\n- RIGHT hits my body. UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all safe.\n\n#### Apple priorities\n- (1,7) is to my left - I'm very close to this apple\n- (0,6) is to my left and down\n- (9,3) and (9,4) are to my right and down\n- (0,3) is far left and down\n- Enemy is at (2,6) and can potentially compete for (1,7) if they move LEFT to (1,6), then UP\n\n#### Enemy position\nEnemy is at (2,6) with body at (2,5), (2,4). From their position, they have safe moves: UP to (2,7), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). They cannot move DOWN to (2,3) as that would be into their own body.\n\n#### Mobility\nI have good mobility with three safe directions available. I'm very close to (1,7) - just need to move LEFT twice more to reach it.\n\n#### Path analysis\n- (1,7): From (3,7), I can go LEFT to (2,7), then LEFT to (1,7) - 2 moves total\n- Enemy at (2,6) can reach (1,7) in: LEFT to (1,6), then UP to (1,7) - 2 moves total\n- We're both the same distance from (1,7)! This is a race\n\n#### Enemy movement prediction\nEnemy at (2,6) likely wants to get to (1,7) or (0,6). They can move UP to (2,7), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). If they move LEFT to (1,6), they'll be on the same path as me for (1,7). If they move UP to (2,7), they block me from going UP. If they move RIGHT to (3,6), they block me from going DOWN.\n\n#### Long-term strategy\nI should move LEFT toward (1,7) since I'm already positioned well for it. I need to get there before the enemy does. After that, I can focus on (0,6) or the right side apples (9,3) and (9,4).\n\n#### Move Selection\n\n**LEFT** to (2,7) is the best choice because:\n- It's safe and positions me to reach (1,7) in 1 more move\n- (1,7) is very close and I'm in a race with the enemy\n- Moving LEFT maintains good mobility for future moves\n- It's the most direct path to the next apple\n\nLEFT",

From (0, 6), I will be in a safe corner relative to Snake #0 and can plan to move DOWN toward the apples at (0, 3) and (9, 3).\n\nAnalyzing immediate safety:\n- **UP (1, 7)**: High collision risk with Snake #0 (Head at 2,7).

It has 1 turn to live. It must move to an apple to survive.\n    *   The apples at (0, 6) and (1, 7) are the closest options to Snake #0.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves to (1, 7), it might die (if it doesn't eat an apple there) or grow. If it moves to (0, 6), it will die on my body (if I don't grow) or engage in a head-on collision if I move there.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open space.\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the strongest move. It keeps me away from the immediate danger zone at (1, 7) and (0, 6). It also allows me to move towards the apples at (9, 3) and (9, 4) via the top row, or drop down to (0, 3) later.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open space.\n    *   **Rationale:** This leaves me trapped in the corner. If I go DOWN now, I have to eventually go UP to get out. Going UP later might put me in the path of Snake #0 if it survives (though unlikely). Generally, moving towards the center/top is better.\n3.  **LEFT:** Impossible (Off board).\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** This is my current neck. Moving into the neck is illegal (suicide).\n    *   **Rationale:** Eliminated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI need to avoid the apple at (0, 6) just in case Snake #0 makes a desperate play for it or dies there. Moving **UP** to (0, 7) is the safest play, keeping me near the wall but on the top row where I have access to many apples. It also keeps me far from Snake #0's likely moves.\n\nUP",

The cell (0, 8) is currently empty (based on the board state: Row 8 has a '0' at (1,8), dots elsewhere).\n    *   Is it legal? Yes.\n    *   **Wait.** Let's re-read the prompt. It says \"Your last move information... UP... Turn: 20\". It also says \"Your snake (ID: 1) - Head: (0, 7)\". This confirms I successfully moved UP to (0, 7).\n    *   Now I need to decide where to go from (0, 7).\n    *   **UP to (0, 8):** Check safety. (0, 8) is empty.\n    *   **DOWN to (0, 6):** This is my current neck. Moving backwards into (0, 6) is illegal (suicide). **Eliminated.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Is it safe? The board state shows 'T' at (1, 7) in Row 7. This represents my body (since my body is [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)], wait).\n        *   Let's map my body carefully.\n        *   Head: (0, 7)\n        *   Neck: (0, 6)\n        *   Body[2]: (1, 6) -> Correct, row 6 has 'T T T' at x=0,1,2.\n        *   Body[3]: (2, 6)\n        *   So, cell (1, 7) is NOT part of my body.\n        *   However, Snake #0 was at (1, 8) and body [(1, 7)...]. If Snake #0 moved UP to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 8) to eat (2, 7)? No, (2, 7) is in row 7.\n        *   Let's look at the board state again.\n        *   Row 7: `1 T T T T . . . . .`\n        *   This board state is slightly confusing because it uses 'T' for my body. It shows '1' at (0,7) and 'T's following. But my body is length 4 (Head + 3 body). So (0,6), (1,6), (2,6).\n        *   The board visualization might be simplified or slightly off relative to the textual description. Let's trust the textual description: Head (0,7), Body [(0,6), (1,6), (2,6)].\n        *   So, (1, 7) is currently empty? No, wait. The textual board state says `Row 7: 1 T T T T ...`. This implies (0,7) is head, (1,7) is body, (2,7) is body... This contradicts the textual body list `[(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)]`.\n        *   *Correction:* The board display is often visual. Let's look at the `Board state` grid:\n            *   Row 9: Empty\n            *   Row 8: ` . 0 . ... ` (Snake #0 head at 1,8)\n            *   Row 7: ` 1 T T T T ... ` (My head at 0,7, body parts at 1,7, 2,7, 3,7, 4,7?) -> This is a *visual representation* that doesn't match the *textual body description* perfectly in terms of positions, but it conveys occupancy.\n            *   Let's stick to the **Textual Body Description** which is authoritative:\n                *   My Body: `[(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)]`\n                *   This means cells (0,6), (1,6), (2,6) are blocked.\n            *   What about Snake #0?\n                *   Head: (1, 8)\n                *   Body: `[(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]`\n                *   This matches the visual for Row 7 (T's at x=1,2,3,4).\n            *   So, to re-evaluate safety from (0, 7):\n                *   **UP (0, 8):**\n                    *   Is it on board? Yes.\n                    *   Is it my body? No. (My body y=6).\n                    *   Is it Enemy body? No. (Enemy body y=7).\n                    *   Is it Enemy Head? No. (Enemy Head (1,8)).\n                    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n                *   **DOWN (0, 6):**\n                    *   Is it my neck? Yes (Body[0] is (0,6)).\n                    *   **Result: ILLEGAL (DEAD).**\n                *   **RIGHT (1, 7):**\n                    *   Is it on board? Yes.\n                    *   Is it my body? No (y=6).\n                    *   Is it Enemy body? **YES.** Snake #0 body is `[(1, 7), ...]`.\n                    *   **Result: DEAD.**\n                *   **LEFT:** Off board. **Result: DEAD.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only safe move is **UP**.\n\nWait, looking at the \"Last Move Information\" provided in the prompt:\n`**START LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`UP`\n`**END LAST MOVE PICK**`\nThis confirms I moved UP. So my current head is (0, 7).\nThe \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section lists `Head: (0, 7)` and `Body: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)]`.\nThis is consistent.\n\nSo, from (0, 7):\n*   **UP (0, 8):** Open.\n*   **DOWN (0, 6):** My neck. Illegal.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 7):** Enemy #0 body. Illegal.\n*   **LEFT:** Off board.\n\nThere is only one valid move: UP.\n\nLong-term plan: I need to survive. Snake #0 is trapped in a corner or has limited moves. If I go UP to (0, 8), I am safe. Snake #0 is at (1, 8). They cannot go LEFT (into me) or RIGHT (into me? No, right is 2,8). Actually, wait. Snake #0 body is at (1,7). If Snake #0 moves UP to (1,9), they survive. If they move LEFT to (0,8), they hit me (if I am there) or nothing? (0,8) is empty. If I move UP to (0,8), and Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0,8), we collide head-on and die. Snake #0 wants to survive. Where is the nearest apple?\nApples: (9,3), (9,4), (0,3), (3,4), (2,1).\nSnake #0 is at (1,8).\nIt will likely try to navigate to apples. It has to get out of the top-left corner.\nI should stay on the left edge (x=0) for now to defend it and move towards the apple at (0,3).\nThe move UP puts me at (0,8). This is the only safe move.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

If they move RIGHT to (1,8), they're going toward (3,4).\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,8), my LEFT move becomes dangerous because (1,8) would be occupied by the enemy head. I need to consider this.\n\n#### Long-term strategy\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,8), I'm positioning myself to get to (3,4) before the enemy. This gives me good mobility for future turns and keeps me away from the enemy's direct path to (0,3). After that, I can focus on (3,4) and then potentially move toward the right side apples (9,3) and (9,4).\n\nIf I move UP to (2,9), I'm going away from all the apples and limiting my options. This doesn't seem strategic.\n\n#### Move Selection\n\n**RIGHT** to (3,8) is the best choice because:\n- It's safe and gives me good mobility for future moves\n- It positions me to get to (3,4) before the enemy if they go for (0,3)\n- It maintains my path toward (3,4) which I'm closer to than the enemy\n- It keeps me in a good position to potentially get to the right side apples later\n- After moving RIGHT, I can go DOWN to (3,7) and then continue toward (3,4)\n\nRIGHT",

This would kill me\n- **RIGHT** to (4,8): No obstacles, safe\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n#### Immediate threats\n- LEFT hits my body - death\n- UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are all safe moves\n\n#### Apple priorities\n- (3,4) is directly below me at (3,8) - only 4 moves away (DOWN x4)\n- (2,1) is diagonally down-left from my current position\n- (0,3) is diagonally down-left from my current position\n- (9,3) and (9,4) are far right\n- Enemy is at (0,9) and can potentially compete for (0,3) if they move DOWN\n\n#### Enemy position\nEnemy is at (0,9) with body at (0,8), (0,7), (0,6). From their position, they have safe moves: DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9).\n\n#### Mobility\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. This gives me good mobility.\n\n#### Path analysis\n- (3,4): From (3,8), I can go: DOWN to (3,7), DOWN to (3,6), DOWN to (3,5), DOWN to (3,4) - 4 moves total\n- Enemy at (0,9) can reach (3,4) in: DOWN to (0,8), RIGHT to (1,8), RIGHT to (2,8), RIGHT to (3,8), DOWN to (3,7), DOWN to (3,6), DOWN to (3,5), DOWN to (3,4) - 8 moves total\n- I'm closer to (3,4) by 4 moves\n\n- (0,3): From (3,8), I can go: LEFT to (2,8), LEFT to (1,8), LEFT to (0,8), DOWN to (0,7), DOWN to (0,6), DOWN to (0,5), DOWN to (0,4), DOWN to (0,3) - 8 moves total\n- Enemy at (0,9) can reach (0,3) in: DOWN to (0,8), DOWN to (0,7), DOWN to (0,6), DOWN to (0,5), DOWN to (0,4), DOWN to (0,3) - 6 moves total\n- Enemy is closer to (0,3) by 2 moves\n\n#### Enemy movement prediction\nEnemy at (0,9) likely wants to get to (0,3) or (3,4). They can move DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9). If they move DOWN to (0,8), they're going toward (0,3). If they move RIGHT to (1,9), they're going toward (3,4).\n\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), my LEFT move becomes dangerous because (0,8) would be occupied by the enemy head. But LEFT is already unsafe because it hits my own body.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,9), they're moving away from (0,3) and toward (3,4), but I'm still much closer to (3,4).\n\n#### Long-term strategy\nI'm in an excellent position to get (3,4) before the enemy. The most direct path is to go DOWN. After getting (3,4), I can focus on other apples.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,9), I'm going away from all the apples and limiting my options. This doesn't seem strategic.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,8), I'm going away from (3,4) and toward the right side apples (9,3) and (9,4). This could be a longer-term strategy, but (3,4) is right there and I should take it.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Long-term plan: The nearest apples are at (0,3) and (2,1). To reach them safely, I need to descend from the top wall. The enemy snake is at (3,5), blocking the direct vertical path. I must navigate around it. Moving LEFT puts me at (2,9). From there, I can continue moving LEFT to (1,9) and eventually (0,9) to drop down the left edge. This path avoids the enemy. From (0,9), I will look to go DOWN to (0,8), (0,7), and eventually reach (0,3). This requires careful maneuvering to avoid trapping myself. The immediate priority is to leave the top wall and create distance from the enemy. Moving LEFT is the first step in this descent.\n\nCurrent board analysis:\n- My head: (3,9).\n- Enemy #0: Head (3,5), Body [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8)].\n- Apples: (0,3), (2,1), (9,3), etc.\n\nMove evaluation from (3,9):\n1.  **UP**: (3,10) -> Out of bounds. **DEAD**.\n2.  **DOWN**: (3,8). Occupied by Enemy #0 body. **DEAD**.\n3.  **RIGHT**: (4,9). Safe, but keeps me trapped against the right wall. I want to go left/down to find apples.\n4.  **LEFT**: (2,9).\n    *   Board: Safe.\n    *   Self: Body is at (2,9)? Wait, let's check my body from the prompt: `Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`.\n    *   **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: My current body occupies (2,9). Therefore, moving LEFT to (2,9) is moving into my own body.\n    *   **WAIT**: Let me re-read the state. `Head: (3, 9)`. `Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`. Yes, (2,9) is part of my body.\n    *   So LEFT is **DEAD**.\n\nWait, let me re-read the state again carefully.\n`Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 9), Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`\nMy body is at (2,9). So I cannot move LEFT.\nMy only option is RIGHT.\n\nLet me double check the board visualization.\nRow 9: `9 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nWait, the board shows `T T T 1` at index 3.\nMy head is at (3,9). The `1` is at index 3.\nWait, the prompt says `Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.`\nRow 9 is top row.\nThe board row `9 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\nCol 0: T, Col 1: T, Col 2: T, Col 3: 1.\nSo `1` is at (3,9).\n\nWhat about my body?\n`Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`\nSo my body is at (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\nThe board shows `T T T` at (0,9), (1,9), (2,9). Yes, that matches.\n\nSo from (3,9):\n- UP: (3,10) - OOB. DEAD.\n- DOWN: (3,8). Board shows at (3,8): `T` (from row 8: `. . . T T ...`). Enemy body includes (3,8). DEAD.\n- LEFT: (2,9). My body is there. DEAD.\n- RIGHT: (4,9). Board shows `.` at (4,9). Safe.\n\nSo my initial analysis of the board was correct, but the \"Long-term plan\" I drafted for LEFT was invalid because I didn't realize (2,9) was occupied by my own body.\nTherefore, the only valid move is RIGHT.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the \"Long-term plan\" section. I should include this realization in my rationale.\nThe prompt asks me to write a \"plan\" or \"strategy note\". Since I am forced to go RIGHT, I should plan what to do after that.\nFrom (4,9), I am still on the top row.\nMy options will be:\n- UP: OOB.\n- DOWN: (4,8).\n- LEFT: (3,9) - Will be empty if I move out (assuming tail moves).\n- RIGHT: (5,9).\nI need to get down. The enemy is at (3,5).\nI should probably try to go down the right side or eventually circle back? No, apples are at (0,3) and (2,1) on the left/bottom.\nGoing RIGHT takes me away from the closest apples. But I have no choice.\nI will go RIGHT now. Then I will likely need to go DOWN, then LEFT eventually.\n\nWait, is there any other option?\n`Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`\nIs it possible `Head: (3, 9)` is wrong? No, it says `Head: (3, 9)`.\nIs it possible the body list is reversed? \"ordered head-to-tail\".\nIs it possible the coordinates are different? No.\nOkay, I am trapped on the left side of the head? No, the head is at 3. Body is at 2, 1, 0.\nSo I am blocked left.\nI am blocked down by enemy (3,8).\nI am blocked up by wall.\nI must go right.\n\nSo the plan is: Move RIGHT to (4,9). Then, try to descend on the right side (x=4 or greater) to get below the enemy. Once below y=5, I can consider moving LEFT to cross over to the apple side.\n\nLet me write the rationale.\n\nOne detail: `Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.`\nThe cell behind my head is (2,9). That is indeed my body.\n\nSo:\n1.  UP: Out of bounds. (4,10) is invalid. DEAD.\n2.  DOWN: (3,8) is occupied by Enemy #0. DEAD.\n3.  LEFT: (2,9) is my own body. DEAD.\n4.  RIGHT: (4,9). Check for collision.\n    - Board: (4,9) is '.'. Empty.\n    - Self: Body is (2,9)... so (4,9) is not self.\n    - Enemy: Enemy body is at (3,8) etc. (4,9) is not enemy.\n    - Result: SAFE.\n\nFinal check of the board state:\nRow 9: `T T T 1 . . . . . .` (Indices 0-9).\nIndices 0, 1, 2 are T (Tail/Body).\nIndex 3 is 1 (Head).\nIndex 4 is `.` (Empty).\nYes.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nRationale:\n- I am forced to move RIGHT because UP, DOWN, and LEFT are blocked or deadly.\n- UP is wall.\n- DOWN is Enemy #0 body at (3,8).\n- LEFT is my own body at (2,9).\n- LONG TERM PLAN: Move RIGHT to (4,9). Then move DOWN to (4,8) to descend from the wall. Once below the enemy at y=5, I can maneuver LEFT towards the apples at (0,3) and (2,1).\n\nWait, I should check if Enemy #0 can hit me if I go RIGHT.\nEnemy #0 head is at (3,5). Distance to (4,9) is sqrt((1)^2 + (4)^2) = 17. Max movement is 1. So no.\n\nWhat about other enemies? Only #0 is listed.\n\nThe prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\". So I don't know where Enemy #0 will move. But I only need to survive this turn.\n\nThe prompt asks me to \"write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nI will write the plan about descending and eventually circling back left.\n\nWait, is there any chance that `Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]` implies that the tail is at (0,9) and I am extending?\nYes, the tail is at (0,9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,9), the tail will move from (0,9) to (1,9).\nThe chain will be: (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9).\nSo (2,9) will be empty next turn.\nThat means if I survive this turn, I will be able to move LEFT next turn? No, I will be at (4,9). (3,9) will be empty.\nSo I can go LEFT next turn to get back to (3,9).\nBut (3,9) is where I am now. That seems inefficient.\nBetter to go RIGHT now, then DOWN, then LEFT.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate safe move.\n\nFinal sanity check on \"LEFT\":\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (2,9).\nThe body segment currently at (2,9) will move to (1,9) (unless I grow).\nWait, `Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.`\nThe cell behind my head IS (2,9).\nSo moving LEFT is fatal.\n\nOkay, I am ready.\n\nOne thought: Is it possible the board view is 1-based? No, \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nIs it possible the board visualization is transposed?\nRow 9 is top. Col 0 is left.\n`9 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\nThis seems correct.\n\nFinal check on enemy moves.\nEnemy #0 is at (3,5). It has 4 apples. It might be growing. Its body length is 5 (including head). It has 4 apples. Wait, \"Apples: 4\". If it ate 4 apples, length is 5. Correct.\nIf it moves, it could go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nIf it goes UP to (3,6), that is occupied by its own body (3,6 is in `[(3, 6), ...]`).\nSo it cannot go UP.\nIt could go DOWN to (3,4). That is an apple `A` at (3,4)? Board shows `4 . . . A ...` at row 4.\nWait, Row 4 is: `. . . A . . . . . A`. Index 3 is `A`.\nSo (3,4) is an apple. It might go there.\nIf it goes DOWN, it moves away from me.\nIt could go LEFT to (2,5).\nIt could go RIGHT to (4,5).\nNone of these threaten (4,9).\n\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nRationale:\nI am trapped on the top row. I cannot go UP (wall), DOWN (enemy), or LEFT (my body). I must go RIGHT to (4,9).\nLong term plan: Descend from the top row, maneuver around the enemy snake at (3,5), and proceed towards the apples at (0,3) and (2,1).\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo the structure should be:\nRationale... (explaining why RIGHT is the only option).\nPlan... (What to do after).\nMove.\n\nActually, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nIt implies the plan is part of the rationale.\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo:\nRationale...\nPlan...\nRIGHT\n\nLet's refine the text.\n\"Long-term plan: I need to descend from the top row to access the apples at (0,3) and (2,1). I am currently blocked by my own body to the LEFT and the enemy snake to the DOWN. I will move RIGHT to (4,9) to clear the immediate obstacle. From (4,9), I will move DOWN to descend. Once I am below the enemy snake (y < 5), I will maneuver LEFT to cross over to the left side of the board where the apples are located.\"\n\nWait, \"the plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn\". This means I should keep it relevant for the immediate next steps.\nMoving to (4,9) is the first step.\nNext turn I will be at (4,9).\nFrom (4,9) I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nI want to go DOWN to escape the wall.\nSo the plan is: Go DOWN next.\n\nLet's check (4,8).\nRow 8: `. . . T T . . . . . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3 are empty. 3 is `T`? No, index 3 is `T` (Enemy body at 3,8).\nIndex 4 is `T` (Enemy body at 4,8? No, `(2,8)` is in enemy body. `(3,8)` is in enemy body).\nRow 8: `. . . T T . . . . . .`\nIndex 3: `T`. Index 4: `T`.\nSo (3,8) and (4,8) are occupied by Enemy #0 body.\nSo if I go DOWN from (4,9) to (4,8), I will crash into the enemy body!\nOkay, that changes things.\nIf I am at (4,9) next turn, I cannot go DOWN to (4,8) because it's occupied.\nI cannot go LEFT to (3,9) because I am just leaving (3,9) and the tail will be at (1,9) or (2,9)? No, the tail moves 1 step.\nMy body will be at (3,9), (2,9), (1,9). So (3,9) will be occupied by my body.\nSo from (4,9) next turn:\n- UP: OOB.\n- DOWN: (4,8) -> Enemy body. DEAD.\n- LEFT: (3,9) -> My body. DEAD.\n- RIGHT: (5,9) -> Empty (presumably).\nSo I will be forced to go RIGHT again!\nI need to keep going RIGHT until I can go DOWN.\nLet's see the board.\nRow 9: `T T T 1 . . . . . .`\nRow 8: `. . . T T . . . . . .`\nRow 7: `. . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 6: `. . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 5: `. . . 0 . . . . . .`\nSo the enemy body is a vertical line at x=3 from y=5 to y=8.\n(3,8) is body. (3,7) body. (3,6) body. (3,5) head.\nWait, enemy body is `[(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]`.\nSo:\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8) are body.\n(2,8) is body.\nSo x=3, y=6..8 is blocked.\nx=2, y=8 is blocked.\n(4,8) is on Row 8: `. . . T T ...`. Index 4 is `T`. So (4,8) is blocked.\n(5,8) is `.`.\nSo I can go DOWN at (5,9) to (5,8) safely?\n\nLet's trace a path.\nTurn 25: Move RIGHT to (4,9).\nTurn 26: At (4,9). Must go RIGHT to (5,9) (Down is blocked, Left is blocked).\nTurn 27: At (5,9).\n    - Can I go DOWN to (5,8)?\n    - Row 8: Index 5 is `.`.\n    - Yes!\n    - Can I go LEFT to (4,9)? My tail will be at (2,9) or (1,9)? No, if I keep going right, my body fills (3,9), (4,9).\n    - Let's say I go DOWN at Turn 27.\n    - My body: (5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9).\n    - I am at (5,8).\n    - I need to get to x=0.\n    - From (5,8), I can go LEFT to (4,8).\n    - Is (4,8) safe? Yes, enemy is at x=3. (4,8) is empty (Row 8: `... T T .` means index 4 is T? Wait. `. . . T T .` means index 3 is T, index 4 is T).\n    - Wait. Row 8: `. . . T T . . . . . .`\n    - Col 0: .\n    - Col 1: .\n    - Col 2: .\n    - Col 3: T\n    - Col 4: T\n    - Col 5: .\n    - So (4,8) is T. Enemy body.\n    - So I cannot go LEFT to (4,8) from (5,8).\n    - I must go DOWN to (5,7).\n    - Row 7: `. . . T . . . . . .`\n    - Col 5 is `.`.\n    - Okay.\n    - From (5,7), can I go LEFT to (4,7)?\n    - Row 7: Col 4 is `.`.\n    - Yes! (4,7) is safe.\n    - From (4,7), can I go DOWN to (4,6)?\n    - Row 6: Col 4 is `.`.\n    - Yes.\n    - From (4,6), can I go LEFT to (3,6)?\n    - No, Enemy body at (3,6).\n    - Must go DOWN to (4,5).\n    - Row 5: Col 4 is `.`.\n    - Yes.\n    - From (4,5), can I go LEFT to (3,5)?\n    - Enemy head is at (3,5). Dangerous!\n    - But wait, this is future planning. I don't know where the enemy will be.\n    - But if I am at (4,5), and the enemy is at (3,5), I can go DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5) if it moves away.\n    - But (3,4) is an apple.\n    - So getting to the left side is crucial.\n\nOkay, so the immediate plan is:\n1. Go RIGHT.\n2. Keep going RIGHT until I can go DOWN past the enemy blockage.\n3. The enemy blockage is at x=3, y=5..8.\n4. At x=4, y=8 is blocked.\n5. At x=5, y=8 is open.\n6. So I need to get to x=5, y=9, then DOWN.\n\nSo the plan is: Move RIGHT. Then keep moving RIGHT if needed to find a gap to descend. Then descend and cross left.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\nOne check: The board at row 9 is `T T T 1 . . . . . .`\nIndices 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are empty.\nSo I can move to (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), etc.\n\nLet's finalize the move.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\nRationale: Trapped. Only RIGHT is safe.\nPlan: Move right to find a gap, then down, then left.\n\nI will output:\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy head is at (3, 9). My body occupies (2, 9), (1, 9), and (0, 9).\nEvaluating moves:\n- UP: (3, 10) is outside the board.\n- DOWN: (3, 8) is occupied by Enemy #0's body.\n- LEFT: (2, 9) is occupied by my own body.\n- RIGHT: (4, 9) is empty and safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**\nI must move RIGHT to escape the wall and my own body. The enemy snake blocks the direct descent at x=3. I will continue moving RIGHT along row 9 until I can move DOWN past the enemy at x=5 or greater. Once below the enemy at y<5, I will navigate LEFT to target the apples at (0, 3) and (2, 1).\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nDoes that mean it should be outside the **START RATIONALE** block?\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nLooking at the example:\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n... rationale ...\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n\nSo the plan is usually part of the rationale text.\nHowever, the instruction \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line\" is a general instruction.\nAnd \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn\" implies it's part of the text I write now.\n\nI will put the plan inside the rationale block, clearly separated.\n\nActually, looking at the user prompt again:\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nIt seems like the plan is an addition to the rationale.\nI will put it inside the rationale block.\n\nOne final check. Is there ANY ambiguity about (2,9)?\n`Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]`\n`Head: (3, 9)`\nThis is standard snake representation.\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (2,9). That is where my neck is.\nMoving into your own neck is death.\nSo LEFT is definitely death.\n\nWhat about DOWN?\n`Body: ... (2, 9) ...`\n`Enemy: Head: (3, 5), Body: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]`\nSo (3,8) is enemy body.\nSo DOWN is death.\n\nWhat about UP?\nBoard size 10x10 (0-9). y=10 is OOB.\n\nSo RIGHT is the only option.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used.\"\nI am confident in my choice.\n\nOne tiny detail. The prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,9), and Enemy #0 moves UP to (3,6) (into its own body? No, (3,6) is body. It can't go up).\nIf Enemy #0 moves DOWN to (3,4), it eats an apple.\nIf Enemy #0 moves LEFT to (2,5).\nIf Enemy #0 moves RIGHT to (4,5).\nNone of these affect me.\n\nWhat if another enemy enters the board? No, only #0 is listed.\n\nOkay, proceeding.\n\nOne check on the \"Plan\" requirement. It says \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nThis implies that the text I write now will be the \"last rationale\" for the next turn.\nSo I should keep the plan concise.\n\nPlan: Move right to (4,9). Prepare to descend past the enemy blockage at x=3. Target apples at (0,3) and (2,1) after safely descending.\n\nThe prompt asks me to think out loud.\nI've done that.\nNow I need to format the output.\n\n\"final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\"\n\nI will write the rationale, then the move.\n\nWait, I should check if I can turn back on myself in the future.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThis means if I am at (4,9), and (3,9) is my body, I cannot go LEFT.\nThis confirms that I will be forced to go RIGHT for a while until I descend enough to have an empty space behind me.\n\nLet's write the output.\n\nSTART RATIONALE\nI am trapped against the top wall. My head is at (3, 9).\n- **UP**: Moves to (3, 10), which is outside the 10x10 board. Result: Death.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 8). This cell is occupied by Enemy #0's body. Result: Death.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (2, 9). This cell is currently occupied by my own body segment. Result: Death.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 9). This cell is empty. Result: Safe.\n\nTherefore, I must move RIGHT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**\nI need to escape the top row and navigate around the enemy snake at (3, 5) to reach the apples on the left side of the board. I will move RIGHT to (4, 9) to clear my body. I anticipate needing to continue moving RIGHT to (5, 9) or further to find a safe column to descend past the enemy's body, which blocks y=8 and y=7 at x=3 and x=4. Once below the enemy, I will turn LEFT towards the apples at (0, 3) and (2, 1).\nEND RATIONALE\nRIGHT\n\nThis looks good. I will make sure the final line is just \"RIGHT\".\n\nOne small check on the \"apples at (0,3) and (2,1)\".\nAre they reachable?\nYes, once I descend.\nThe enemy is at x=3.\nIf I go down at x=6, I can cross over at y=4 or y=3.\n(0,3) is at the bottom left.\n(2,1) is near the bottom.\nI have plenty of turns (turn 25/150).\n\nThe plan seems solid.\n\nFinal check on the board state text:\n`9 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n`8 . . . T T . . . . .`\n`7 . . . T . . . . . .`\n`6 . . . T . . . . . .`\n`5 . . . 0 . . . . . .`\n`4 . . . A . . . . . A`\n`3 A . . . . . . . . A`\n`2 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`1 . . A . . . . . . .`\n`0 . . . . . . . . . .`\n\nIndices 0-9.\nRow 9 (y=9): Cols 0,1,2 are T (my body). Col 3 is 1 (me). Col 4 is . (target).\nRow 8 (y=8): Col 3 is T, Col 4 is T (enemy body).\nSo (4,8) is blocked.\nRow 7 (y=7): Col 3 is T.\nRow 6 (y=6): Col 3 is T.\nRow 5 (y=5): Col 3 is 0 (enemy head).\n\nSo my analysis that I need to go to x=5 or more to descend is correct.\n\nReady.\n\nSTART RATIONALE\nI am currently at (3, 9) and surrounded by obstacles on three sides. \n- **UP**: Is outside the board (y=10).\n- **DOWN**: Is occupied by Enemy #0's body at (3, 8).\n- **LEFT**: Is occupied by my own body at (2, 9).\n- **RIGHT**: To (4, 9) is the only empty and valid cell.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**\nI must move RIGHT to escape the wall and my own tail. I plan to continue moving RIGHT along row 9 until I can safely move DOWN past the enemy snake's body blockage (which spans x=3,4 at y=8,7,6). Once I descend below the enemy at y<5, I will navigate LEFT towards the apples at (0, 3) and (2, 1).\nEND RATIONALE\nRIGHT",

I need to eventually navigate around the enemy snake's body which blocks the path at x=3,4 (y=5 to y=8).\n*   **Long-term:** Eat apples at (0,3) and (2,1). To get there, I need to cross the board.\n*   **Choice:** Moving RIGHT (x=7, y=9) is safer than moving DOWN (x=6, y=8) because moving DOWN puts me closer to the center where the enemy snake is active and near its body. Staying on the edge (RIGHT) provides more predictable movement and space to maneuver later.\n\nI will continue moving RIGHT.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Continue moving RIGHT along the top edge. Once I am clear of my own tail and the wall, I will turn DOWN to navigate around the enemy snake's body blockade at x=3-4.\n\nRIGHT",

No, (4,3) is to the Right, (3,4) is Up, (3,2) is Down (Empty), (2,3) is Left (Empty)].\n*   **Wait, re-evaluating Snake #0's surroundings:**\n    *   (3,3) Head.\n    *   Right: (4,3) is Body.\n    *   Up: (3,4) is Body.\n    *   Down: (3,2).

The gap between (0,3) and (3,3) seems empty on the map provided. So (2,3) is likely Empty.\n*   **Prediction:** Snake #0 cannot move Right or Up (into body). It will likely move Down to (3,2) or Left to (2,3).\n*   **Impact:** Snake #0 is far away. It poses no immediate head-on collision threat to my head at (7,9).\n\n**3. Strategic Plan:**\n*   **Current Goal:** Survive and navigate towards apples at (0,3) and (2,1).\n*   **Immediate Move:** Both RIGHT (to 8,9) and DOWN (to 7,8) are safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (8,9):** Moves me closer to the right wall (x=9).

Continuing RIGHT follows this plan to reach the far right corner where I have more space to turn.\n    *   Moving DOWN immediately would bring me to (7,8). While safe, it might be slightly closer to potential future congestion if the enemy snake moves north (unlikely given its trap, but possible if it escapes). Staying on the edge (x=9) is a standard safe play in Snake.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (8,9). Next turn, move RIGHT to (9,9), then turn DOWN to start descending the right side of the board. This path keeps me away from the enemy snake and my own tail.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

(3,1) is Empty.\n    *   Left: (2,2). Row 2 has '0' at (3,2). (2,2) is Empty.\n*   **Prediction:** Snake #0 has multiple valid moves (Right, Down, Left). It is not immediately suicidal.

It keeps my options more open.\n*   **Choice:** I will choose **DOWN**.\n    *   *Correction/Refinement:* Last turn I said \"Continuing RIGHT follows this plan to reach the far right corner\". However, reaching the corner actually *reduces* my immediate options (I can't go Right or Up, only Down or Left). Staying at (8,8) or (8,9) allows me to move Right *later* if I want to clear the wall. Moving DOWN now keeps me away from the wall and maintains flexibility. Furthermore, moving DOWN brings me closer to the apples at (0,3) and (2,1) (reducing Y distance from 9 to 8).\n    *   Actually, let's look at the board again. I am at (8,9). The safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (8,8):\n        *   Next turn, I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (9,9):\n        *   Next turn, I can go DOWN or LEFT.\n    *   Moving DOWN provides better flexibility and moves me towards the apples.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (8,8).

This is currently empty and was my previous head position. It is valid.\n    *   **DOWN**: Moves to (8, 7). This cell is empty. Valid.\n    *   **LEFT**: Moves to (7, 8). This cell is empty. Valid.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 8). This cell is empty. Valid.\n    *   All directions are immediately safe.\n\n4.  **Strategic Analysis**:\n    *   The nearest apples (excluding the distant ones on the left) are at (9, 4) and (9, 2).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** brings me closer to the vertical column of apples at x=9.\n    *   The enemy snake is currently at a safe distance. It appears to be roaming near the left side (based on `T` traces), so the right side is relatively clear for me to clear apples.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (9, 8) allows me to continue \"sweeping\" the right edge downwards, which is a standard Snake strategy to clear outer apples efficiently.\n    *   While DOWN or LEFT are safe, they don't align with the goal of collecting the nearest apples quickly.\n\n5.  **Rationale**: Moving RIGHT is the best path to reach the apples at (9, 4) and (9, 2). It maintains the strategy of clearing the right side of the board while the enemy is occupied elsewhere. My body will follow, maintaining safety.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** Continue moving RIGHT towards the right edge to clear the apples at (9, 4) and (9, 2). Once I reach the bottom right corner (9,0 or 9,1), I will navigate left towards the other apples.\n\nRIGHT",

There is also an apple at `(9, 9)` behind me, but continuing down towards the cluster is more efficient.\n    *   **Board State**: Column `x=9` is mostly clear below the head. `y=5` is empty, `y=4` has an apple, `y=3` has an apple, `y=2` has an apple.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves for Turn 35**:\n    *   **UP**: Target `(9, 7)`.\n        *   This cell is currently occupied by my own body segment `(9, 7)`.

The enemy snake's head is at (9, 6).\n\n**Move Options from (1, 2)**\n\n- **UP to (1, 3)**: This is an empty space. It's safe and moves me up the board. However, it doesn't head toward any apple directly and might limit my space.\n- **DOWN to (1, 1)**: This is an empty space. It's safe but moves me down toward the bottom edge, which could restrict future movement.\n- **LEFT to (0, 2)**: This is an empty space. It's safe and moves me left. It doesn't collect an apple immediately, but it opens up the board and positions me to potentially go for the (0, 3) apple next.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 2)**: This is my own body segment. Moving here would kill me.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe move RIGHT is eliminated because it's into my own body. The moves UP and DOWN are safe but don't offer an immediate strategic advantage and could lead to tighter spaces. LEFT to (0, 2) is safe and opens up the board. From (0, 2), I can potentially go for the (0, 3) apple on the next turn, or I can explore other options. This move keeps my options open and moves me away from the center where the enemy is located.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn**\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 2), on the next turn I will consider moving UP to (0, 3) to collect the apple there. This will increase my lead to 9-3. I should remain aware of the enemy's position and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nLEFT",

It's safe and moves me toward the center of the board.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should choose between UP and RIGHT since DOWN and LEFT are fatal.\n\n- **UP (0, 4)**: Safe, moves me up, keeps me on the left edge but gives more vertical mobility.\n- **RIGHT (1, 3)**: Safe, moves me toward the center, potentially toward the apple at (2, 3).\n\nLooking at the apple positions, the apple at (2, 3) is relatively close. RIGHT would be a better move to head toward that apple. UP would keep me on the left edge which could be restrictive.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 3), I'll be closer to the apple at (2, 3). If that apple is still there on my next turn, I can move RIGHT again to collect it. I should also remain aware of the enemy snake's movement and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

Body `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`.\n    *   **Apples:** I am currently sitting on an apple at `(9, 3)`. I will eat it when I move. There is an apple at `(9, 2)` directly below me.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(1, 3)`. Body stretches across the bottom left. Far away.\n\n2.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** Target `(9, 4)`. This is occupied by my body (segment 1). **DEADLY**.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(9, 2)`. This contains an apple. The path is clear. The cell `(9, 2)` is currently `A`, so it is safe to enter. After eating the apple, I will grow, but the move itself is valid.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(8, 3)`. Currently empty. Safe, but moves away from the apple cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(10, 3)`. Off the board. **DEADLY**.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    I am currently on an apple. I need to move to claim it (or rather, the snake moves, and the head vacating the spot finalizes the consumption, but actually, the head *enters* a new spot. Wait, in standard Snake, you eat by moving *into* the apple. In the provided last move info, I was at `(9, 4)` and moved DOWN to `(9, 3)`. The board state shows me at `(9, 3)` and an apple at `(9, 3)`?\n    Let's re-read the board state: \"3 T 0 A T T . A . . 1\". At `x=9` (rightmost), `y=3`, the character is `1`. At `x=7` (`y=3`), it is `A`. At `x=1`, `y=3`, it is `0`.\n    Wait, the board legend: `1` is my head. `A` is apple.\n    The board row for y=3: `3 T 0 A T T . A . . 1`.\n    Columns: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    - `x=0, y=3`: `T` (Enemy body)\n    - `x=1, y=3`: `0` (Enemy head)\n    - `x=2, y=3`: `A` (Apple? No, wait. The apples listed are (9,2), (6,3), (7,6), (2,3), (6,2). Let's map the board carefully.)\n    \n    Board Row 3: `T 0 A T T . A . . 1`\n    - Col 0: `T` (Enemy Body)\n    - Col 1: `0` (Enemy Head)\n    - Col 2: `A` (This matches the listed apple at (2,3))\n    - Col 3: `T` (Enemy Body)\n    - Col 4: `T` (Enemy Body)\n    - Col 5: `.`\n    - Col 6: `A` (This matches the listed apple at (6,3))\n    - Col 7: `.`\n    - Col 8: `.`\n    - Col 9: `1` (My Head)\n    \n    Board Row 2: `T T T T . . A . . A`\n    - Col 0: `T`\n    - Col 1: `T`\n    - Col 2: `T`\n    - Col 3: `T`\n    - Col 4: `.`\n    - Col 5: `.`\n    - Col 6: `A` (Apple at 6,2)\n    - Col 7: `.`\n    - Col 8: `.`\n    - Col 9: `A` (Apple at 9,2)\n    \n    So, My Head is at `(9, 3)`. The apple is at `(9, 2)` (Col 9, Row 2).\n    I need to check if I am *currently* on an apple. The board shows `1` at `(9,3)`. No `A` at `(9,3)`. The apples are at `(9,2)`, `(6,3)`, `(7,6)`, `(2,3)`, `(6,2)`.\n    So I am NOT on an apple right now. I am just to the right of an apple at `(6,3)` and above an apple at `(9,2)`.\n    \n    Let's re-evaluate moves:\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(9, 2)`. This is an Apple (based on the list and the board row 2 showing `A` at col 9). Safe move. Good.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(8, 3)`. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **UP:** `(9, 4)` -> Body. Unsafe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(10, 3)` -> Wall. Unsafe.\n    \n    Decision: Down is the best move as it secures an apple and keeps me aligned on the right edge. I can then move Left to get the apple at (6,2) or (6,3) later.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Body `[(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(2, 4)`. Body occupies `(2, 3)` and stretches to the left. The snake previously had a segment at `(3, 1)`, but the tail moved from `(3, 1)` to `(3, 2)`? No, the body list ended with `(3, 3)`. Actually, looking at the board state and the previous body list `..., (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)`, the tail is at `(3, 3)` (or the segment that connects to the head). The board state shows `.` at `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)` in row 1 and 2, but `T` at `(3, 3)` in row 3. So the tail is at `(3, 3)`.\n    *   **Apples:** Closest apples are `(7, 2)` (bottom right) and `(6, 3)` (mid right).\n    *   **Board:** Clear column 9. Row 1 is safe in the right area.\n\n2.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** Target `(9, 2)`. This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following the head). **DEADLY**.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(9, 0)`. This cell is currently empty. It is within board bounds. It keeps me in the safe right column. It also moves me closer to the apple at `(7, 2)` (distance 2) and keeps the path to `(6, 3)` open.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(8, 1)`. Currently empty. This moves me out of the secure column 9 into column 8. While potentially safer than moving UP, it puts my head in a position where the enemy snake might turn towards (he is at `(2, 4)` looking East).\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(10, 1)`. Off the board. **DEADLY**.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   The choice is between DOWN and LEFT.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to `(9, 0)` is optimal. It maintains my isolation on the right edge, ensuring I don't collide with the enemy or get cut off. It positions me to eat the apple at `(7, 2)` next turn (by moving Left to `(8, 0)`, then Left to `(7, 0)`, then Up to `(7, 1)`, then Up to `(7, 2)`). Actually, from `(9, 0)`, the direct Manhattan distance to `(7, 2)` is 3. I can sweep the bottom row.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to `(8, 1)` is riskier because it opens up the central board where the enemy is active. Staying in column 9 is the safest play to ensure survival and allow my tail to clear.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Apples at (7,2) and (6,2).\n  I can move LEFT to (7,2) -> Apple. Or LEFT to (7,2).\n  If I go UP now, I can go LEFT -> (7,2) -> Eat (7,2).

(9,4).\n  If I go UP to (8,2), I am moving away from the wall where my body is.\n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am moving towards the center.\n  \n  Consider the wall at x=9.\n  My body is blocking the right side.\n  I want to get to the apples at x=6.\n  Moving LEFT is generally good.\n  \n  Let's look at the coordinates carefully.\n  (7,2) is an apple.\n  (6,2) is an apple.\n  (6,3) is an apple.\n  \n  If I go UP to (8,2):\n  My head is (8,2).\n  Next moves: LEFT to (7,2).

No, I move to (8,2).\n  Is (8,2) safe from Enemy?\n  Enemy is at (1,6). Distance is huge.\n  Is (8,2) safe from myself?\n  My body is at (8,0) and (9,0)...

(9,4)].\n  If I then go LEFT to (7,2):\n  Future state: Head (7,2), Body: [(8,2), (8,1), (8,0)...].\n  If I go UP to (8,2) and then LEFT to (7,2), I am moving along the row y=2.\n  \n  LEFT to (7,1):\n  Future state: Head (7,1), Body: [(8,1), (8,0), (9,0)...].\n  If I then go UP to (7,2):\n  Future state: Head (7,2), Body: [(7,1), (8,1), (8,0)...].\n  \n  Both paths are valid.\n  However, consider the tail.\n  My tail is at (9,4).\n  If I move UP to (8,2), my body length increases by 1 (if I eat) or shifts (if not).\n  Currently I haven't eaten.\n  If I don't eat, the tail moves to (9,3).\n  If I eat, the tail stays at (9,4).\n  \n  Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\".\n  \"My head is at (8,0)\".\n  Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (8, 1)\".\n  \"Your last move information\" says \"UP\".\n  \"My head is at (8,0)\".\n  There is a contradiction or it's describing the state *before* the move.\n  \"Turn: 42 / 150\"\n  If previous head was (8,0), moving UP puts me at (8,1). This matches current Head (8,1).\n  So the \"Last Rationale\" was written for the move from (8,0) to (8,1).\n  \n  Now I am at (8,1).\n  I need to choose between UP and LEFT.\n  \n  If I go UP to (8,2):\n  I am at y=2.\n  Apples are at y=2 and y=3.\n  I am closer in Y.\n  Distance to (7,2) is 1 (LEFT).\n  Distance to (6,2) is 2 (LEFT, LEFT).\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (7,1):\n  I am at x=7.\n  Distance to (7,2) is 1 (UP).\n  Distance to (6,2) is 2 (UP, LEFT) or (LEFT, UP).\n  \n  Both are fine.\n  However, if I go UP, I am moving away from the \"corner\" at (9,0).\n  My body occupies the right wall.\n  Getting to the center (x=6) is the priority.\n  Moving LEFT (to 7,1) puts me closer to x=6 immediately.\n  But moving UP (to 8,2) opens up the y-axis.\n  \n  Let's consider a trap scenario.\n  If I stay at y=1 (moving LEFT), I might be forced to move around the apples at (6,2) and (7,2).\n  If I go UP to (8,2), I can effectively \"sweep\" the apples from above or below.\n  \n  Let's check if there are any apples at (8,2) or (7,1). No.\n  \n  Let's check the board state again.\n  Row 1: \". . T . . . . . 1 T\"\n  Row 2: \"T T T . . . A A . T\"\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (7,1):\n  I enter (7,1). This is empty.\n  Next turn I can go UP to (7,2) to eat the apple.\n  However, if Enemy #0 decides to move strangely (unlikely given distance), it doesn't matter.\n  \n  If I go UP to (8,2):\n  I enter (8,2).\n  Next turn I can go LEFT to (7,2) to eat the apple.\n  \n  Is there any difference?\n  If I am at (7,1):\n  Head: (7,1).\n  Body: (8,1), (8,0), (9,0)...\n  If I go UP to (7,2):\n  Head: (7,2).\n  Body: (7,1), (8,1), (8,0)...\n  This is fine.\n  \n  If I am at (8,2):\n  Head: (8,2).\n  Body: (8,1), (8,0), (9,0)...\n  If I go LEFT to (7,2):\n  Head: (7,2).\n  Body: (8,2), (8,1), (8,0)...\n  \n  Consider the apple at (6,3).\n  To reach (6,3) from (7,2): UP to (7,3), LEFT to (6,3).\n  From (6,2): UP to (6,3).\n  \n  Let's think about the \"future options\".\n  UP to (8,2) keeps the path (7,2), (6,2), (6,3) open.\n  LEFT to (7,1) keeps the path (7,2), (6,2), (6,3) open.\n  \n  Is there any danger at (8,2)?\n  The board shows 'T' at (9,2). My body.\n  (8,2) is '.'.\n  Is (7,2) an apple. Yes.\n  Is (6,2) an apple. Yes.\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am entering the column where the apples are.\n  If I go UP to (8,2), I am adjacent to the column.\n  \n  Let's check the \"Last Rationale\" hint.\n  \"I need to reach the apples at (6,2) and (6,3) eventually.\"\n  \"By moving **UP** to (8,1), I open up paths...\"\n  \n  The prompt suggests UP was the previous move.\n  Now I am at (8,1).\n  If I continue UP to (8,2), I am fully committing to the y-axis approach.\n  If I go LEFT, I am cutting across.\n  \n  Let's verify coordinates one more time.\n  Apples: (6, 3), (7, 6), (6, 2), (1, 7), (7, 2).\n  My head: (8, 1).\n  \n  Target (7,2) is X=7, Y=2.\n  Target (6,2) is X=6, Y=2.\n  \n  Option A: UP -> (8,2).\n  Distance to (7,2) = 1.\n  Distance to (6,2) = 2.\n  \n  Option B: LEFT -> (7,1).\n  Distance to (7,2) = 1.\n  Distance to (6,2) = 2.\n  \n  It's a tie on distance.\n  \n  What about the \"Safe moves\" rule?\n  \"Prefer moves that ... keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\"\n  \n  At (8,2):\n  Open space to the left (7,2 is apple, 6,2 is apple).\n  Open space up? (8,3) is '.' on board (Row 3: \"... A . .\" -> (8,3) is '.').\n  So (8,2) is a junction.\n  \n  At (7,1):\n  (7,2) is apple.\n  (6,1) is '.' (Row 1: \"... . . . . . 1 T\" -> (6,1) is '.').\n  (7,0) is '.' (Row 0: \". . . . . . . . T T\" -> (7,0) is '.').\n  \n  Both are junctions.\n  \n  However, moving UP from (8,1) to (8,2) places the head above the \"shelf\" formed by the body on the right wall.\n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am moving into the \"field\" between the right wall and the enemy.\n  \n  The enemy is at (1,6) -> (2,1).\n  They are far away.\n  \n  Let's consider the tail.\n  My tail is at (9,4).\n  If I eat an apple, I grow.\n  If I don't eat, I move.\n  \n  If I go UP:\n  New body: (8,1) -> (8,0) -> (9,0) -> (9,1) -> (9,2) -> (9,3) -> (9,4).\n  The cell (9,4) becomes empty (tail moved to 9,3).\n  \n  If I go LEFT:\n  New body: (8,1) -> (8,0) -> (9,0) -> ... -> (9,4).\n  Same.\n  \n  Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\" again.\n  \"By moving **UP** to (8,1), I open up paths to the apples while keeping my tail path (7,0) available if needed.\"\n  Wait, tail path is (9,4).\n  (7,0) is empty.\n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am essentially moving \"back\" towards the tail path?\n  No, the tail is at (9,4).\n  \n  Let's check the board state for row 0 again.\n  `0 . . . . . . . .

(2,1).\n  \n  If I go UP to (8,2):\n  I am at (8,2).\n  I see (7,2) is Apple.\n  I see (6,2) is Apple.\n  I see (6,3) is Apple.\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (7,1):\n  I am at (7,1).\n  I see (7,2) is Apple.\n  I see (6,1) is empty.\n  I see (7,0) is empty.\n  \n  Let's assume the \"optimal\" path to eat the cluster is to sweep from right to left at y=2.\n  Step 1: Move to y=2.\n  Step 2: Move left to (7,2), (6,2).\n  Step 3: Move up to (6,3).\n  \n  If I go UP to (8,2), I am at y=2.\n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am at y=1.\n  \n  So UP puts me one step ahead on the \"sweep\" plan.\n  \n  Also, if I go UP, I am on the same row as the apples.\n  If I go LEFT, I am one row below.\n  \n  Being on the row allows me to \"claim\" the row.\n  \n  Let's check the \"My last move\".\n  \"By moving UP to (8,1), I open up paths to the apples...\"\n  This implies that staying low (at y=0) was bad, and going up is good.\n  Continuing UP to (8,2) seems to be the logical extension.\n  \n  If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am still at y=1.\n  If I go UP to (8,2), I am at y=2.\n  \n  The target y-coordinates are 2 and 3.\n  \n  So UP is better.\n  \n  Also, if I go UP, I am at (8,2).\n  If the enemy moves to (2,6), etc, it doesn't matter.\n  \n  Let's verify the \"backwards\" rule.\n  From (8,1), UP is (8,2). Not backwards.\n  From (8,1), LEFT is (7,1). Not backwards.\n  \n  Final check on safety:\n  (8,2): '.' on board. Empty of my body. Empty of enemy body.\n  (7,1): '.' on board. Empty of my body. Empty of enemy body.\n  \n  Both are safe.\n  \n  Strategy:\n  Eat the cluster at (6,2), (7,2), (6,3).\n  Path: (8,1) -> (8,2) -> (7,2) -> (6,2) -> (6,3).\n  \n  Why UP?\n  It puts me on the correct Y-level immediately.\n  It keeps me away from the \"left\" side where the enemy might be (even though enemy is far, it's good practice).\n  It maintains the \"column 8\" open if I need to retreat.\n  \n  Why not LEFT?\n  LEFT puts me at (7,1).\n  Next I must go UP to (7,2).\n  It takes one turn longer to reach the sweep row.\n  \n  So, UP is the move.\n\nUP",

This is a good move to gain space and position for the apple at (7, 6) or to navigate around the enemy. From (7, 4), I can still access the cluster of apples.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2)**: Contains an apple. This is a safe move that scores a point. However, looking at the board, moving to (7, 2) puts my head between the enemy's potential path (at (6, 3) or (6, 2)) and my own body (at (8, 2) and (8, 3)). Specifically, my body occupies (8, 3) and (8, 2). If I go to (7, 2), I am sandwiched.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3)**: Contains an apple. This is a safe move that scores a point. It moves me directly into the cluster. From (6, 3), I can go to (6, 2) (another apple) or (5, 3) or (6, 4). This seems active.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3)**: Occupied by my own body (the neck). **Unsafe**.\n\nComparing **UP (7, 4)** and **LEFT (6, 3)**:\n*   **LEFT** scores immediately and puts me in a dense area of apples. The immediate risk is that the enemy snake (head at 3,7) might be aiming for the same apples, but given the distance, I can secure them first. However, being at (6, 3) with body extending to (7, 3) and (8, 3) creates a potential bottleneck if the enemy approaches from the north.\n*   **UP (7, 4)** is a \"tempo\" move. It keeps me flexible. I can then pivot to eat (6, 3) or (7, 6) next turn. It keeps me away from the tight quarters near the wall.\n\nGiven the \"keep future options open\" strategy, **UP** is safer. If I go LEFT to (6, 3), I might find myself blocked in if the enemy moves towards (5, 3) or (6, 2). If I go UP to (7, 4), I have access to both the top apple (7, 6) and the left apples (6, 3) next turn. I will prioritize space and safety over the immediate point.\n\nUP\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nUP",

No collision. This is safe.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 3)**: The body segment `(7, 3)` is currently present (it will move to `(8, 3)` next turn). Moving into it counts as suicide. Unsafe.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 4)**: Empty. Safe. This moves towards the apple at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 2)`.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 4)**: Empty. Safe. This is close to the body, but currently open.\n\n3.  **Strategic Assessment**:\n    *   The prompt's provided rationale (from the previous turn, assuming the head was at `(7, 3)` or similar) correctly identified `UP` as a safe, open move.\n    *   Currently at `(7, 4)`, `UP` to `(7, 5)` maintains the \"escape\" trajectory to the top. If I go `UP`, I maintain distance from the enemy snake to the west and keep the path to the apple at `(7, 6)` open.\n    *   `LEFT` to `(6, 4)` is also a strong move to engage the apple cluster at `(6, 3)`, `(7, 2)`, etc.\n    *   Considering the enemy snake at `(3, 6)` with a long body extending west and south, direct confrontation is not immediately necessary. `UP` keeps me away from that cluster and maintains a safer position in the open space.\n\n4.  **Decision**: `UP` is the safest move that preserves flexibility. It avoids the tight cluster of apples where the enemy might be heading.\n\nLong-term plan: Maintain distance from the enemy and the dense wall region.

          "rationale": "Based on the current board state, my snake's head is at (7, 8). Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP**: Moving to (7, 9). This is within the board boundaries. The board shows row 9 is empty. This is a safe move.\n2.  **LEFT**: Moving to (6, 8). The board shows (6, 8) is empty. However, looking ahead, (6, 7) contains an enemy tail. If I move to (6, 8), I have no immediate food and might be heading into a position where the enemy's body blocks my path. The enemy head is at (6, 5), moving North, so collision is unlikely, but being blocked is a concern.\n3.  **DOWN**: Moving to (7, 7). The map shows this is the segment immediately behind my head (part of my body: `[(7, 7), (7, 6)...]`). Moving here is illegal (hitting myself) and results in death.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving to (8, 8). The map shows (8, 8) is empty. However, looking at my body, I have a segment at (8, 3) and (8, 2). If I head East, I might corner myself or cross my own path later. (8, 7) is also part of my body if I look at the previous turn, but currently (8, 8) is safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween UP, LEFT, and RIGHT, UP (to 7,9) seems the most defensible. It moves me to the top edge where I can bounce or turn later. It avoids the potentially cluttered area to the left where the enemy is, and avoids the direction where my body trails (Left/Down/Right form a path that could get confusing).\n\nWait, let me re-verify the body coordinates from the input:\nHead: (7, 8)\nBody: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2)]\nSo the cell directly south of my head (7, 7) is indeed occupied by my body. **DOWN is fatal.**\n\nLet's look at the apples again: (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (3, 2), (9, 7).\nI am at (7, 8). The closest ones are to the South/South-West. However, going South is death. I am currently safe at the top. Moving UP to (7, 9) puts me at the top wall. From there, I can plan to go East to (8, 9) or West to (6, 9), or prepare to turn South later once my tail clears.\n\nActually, looking at the board again:\nRow 7: `T T T . . . T . A` (Wait, the map shows my head at (7, 8) and T's are tails).\nRow 9: ` . . . . . . . . . .` (All empty).\nRow 8: ` . . . . . . . 1 . .`\n\nLet's re-verify the input state map:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . 1 . .   <-- My head is at (7, 8)\n 7 . T T T . . . T . A   <-- (7, 7) is T (my body), (8, 7) is T (my body from prev turn? No, current body is (8,3))\n```\nActually, the body list provided is the *current* body. Head (7,8). Next is (7,7). Then (7,6)... then (8,3).\nSo:\n(7,8) Head\n(7,7) Body\n...\n(8,3) Body\n(8,2) Body\n\nCheck moves:\n- **DOWN to (7,7)**: Occupied by my body. **Death.**\n- **RIGHT to (8,8)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (6,8)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **UP to (7,9)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nWhy UP?\nGoing UP is a standard defensive move when you are high on the board and your tail is below. It moves me away from the immediate congestion of the center where the enemy is (at (6,5)) and where my body is (stacked at x=7, x=8).\nGoing RIGHT (8,8) is also safe, but I have body segments at (8,3) and (8,2). If I keep going East, I might have to snake around. Going UP to the wall clears the bottom area.\nThe enemy is moving North. I am moving North. We are separating. This is good.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

The tail from the previous turn is at (7, 8). However, the snake body moves forward. The tail cell from the previous turn is vacated this turn. The snake body will shift: Head (7,9) -> (7,8), old head (7,8) -> (7,7)... wait. My current body is: (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), ... So (7,8) is currently occupied. So moving DOWN would be into my own body. Dead.\n    *   **LEFT:** Would go to (6, 9). This is currently empty.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Would go to (8, 9). This is currently empty.\n\n2.  **Enemy Collision (Snake #0):**\n    *   Enemy Snake #0 is at (6,6) with body segments: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5)].\n    *   The enemy head is at (6,6). The surrounding cells are (6,5) (body), (5,6) (body), (7,6) (empty), (6,7) (empty).\n    *   It is likely the enemy will move into (7,6) or (6,7) or (5,6) (maybe not, body).\n    *   If the enemy moves to (7,6), it is safe. If it moves to (6,7), it is safe.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (6,9), I am far away. If the enemy moves UP to (6,7), it is safe.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (8,9), I am far away.\n    *   No immediate head-on collision is likely this turn, as the enemy is far (distance ~13 for Left, ~11 for Right).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves: LEFT and RIGHT.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):**\n    *   This places me at the top wall (y=9). I can move LEFT to (5,9), DOWN (to (6,8)), or RIGHT (back to (7,9)).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (6,8) leads into the area near the enemy. (6,8) is empty.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (5,9) stays at the top.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n    *   This places me at the top wall (y=9). I can move RIGHT to (9,9), DOWN (to (8,8)), or LEFT (back to (7,9)).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (8,8) is empty.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (9,9) is the top-right corner. From there, I can only go DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Comparison:**\nThe enemy is at (6,6). My body is mostly vertical at x=7.\nGoing LEFT brings me slightly closer to the enemy's current position, but I am at the top (y=9) and he is at y=6, so there is a buffer.\nGoing RIGHT moves me away from the enemy. My body trails at (8,3) and (8,2). If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I am approaching my own body column at x=8. My body goes down to y=3. So I have plenty of space (8,8), (8,7)... before hitting my tail.\nHowever, going LEFT to (6,9) is also safe and gives me a wider space between the wall and my vertical body stack at x=7.\n\nLet's look at apples. Closest are (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (3,2), (9,7).\nTo get to the bottom apples, I eventually have to go DOWN.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,9), I can spiral around. If I go LEFT to (6,9), I am closer to the left side.\nActually, looking at the board map:\nRow 7: ` . T T T . . . T . A` (Wait, the T's are Snake #0's tail).\nRow 7 from input: `7 . T T T . . . T . A`\nLet's look at my body. It's at x=7, y=8 down to y=3, then x=8, y=3.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,9), I am at x=8. My body is below at x=8, y=3. This is a safe direction.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9), I am at x=6. The enemy body is mostly at x=1-6, y=5-7.\nThe space to the RIGHT (x=8, x=9) is currently empty of enemies and my own body (except tail at x=8, y=3).\nThe space to the LEFT (x=6, x=5) has the enemy nearby.\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the safer long-term play to avoid the enemy.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (8,9).\nFrom (8,9), I will likely need to turn DOWN soon to start collecting apples at the bottom.\nTurning DOWN from (8,9) puts me at (8,8). My tail (currently at (8,2)) will have moved, clearing the path. This is a standard maneuver.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

I am currently at (8, 9).\n\nLet's analyze the immediate threats:\n1.  **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** Would hit the wall (y=10 is outside 0-9). Dead.\n    *   **DOWN:** Would go to (8, 8). The tail from the previous turn is at (8, 2). The snake body shifts: Head (8,9) -> (8,8), old head (8,8) -> (8,7)... wait. My current body is: (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (8,3). So (8,8) is currently empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** Would go to (7, 9). This is currently occupied by my body (segment 1). Dead.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Would go to (9, 9). This is currently empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Enemy Collision (Snake #0):**\n    *   Enemy Snake #0 is at (6,6) with body segments: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)].\n    *   The enemy head is at (6,6). The surrounding cells are (6,5) (body), (5,6) (body), (7,6) (empty), (6,7) (empty).\n    *   The enemy is far away (distance ~15 for DOWN, ~12 for RIGHT). No immediate head-on collision is likely this turn.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves: DOWN and RIGHT.**\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):**\n    *   This places me at y=8. I can move DOWN to (8,7), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8)).\n    *   My body trails down at (8,3) and then left to (7,3). Going DOWN to (8,7) or (8,6) is safe until I get closer to my tail.\n    *   This direction points towards the apples at the bottom of the board: (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (3,2).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 9):**\n    *   This places me at the top-right corner (x=9, y=9).\n    *   From (9,9), I can only go DOWN (to (9,8)) or LEFT (back to (8,9)).\n    *   This is a corner, which reduces my immediate options. While safe, it restricts movement.\n    *   Moving to (9,9) moves me away from the closest apples at the bottom. I would have to go DOWN, then LEFT eventually to reach them, possibly crossing through tight spaces.\n\n**Comparison:**\nGoing DOWN to (8, 8) is the superior choice. It moves me directly towards the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board (specifically (7,2), (6,2), (6,3)). It also keeps my options open (3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), whereas RIGHT to (9,9) leaves me with only 2 safe moves and traps me in a corner. The path downwards is currently clear of my own body (my body is at x=8, y=3; I am at x=8, y=8, so 5 cells of safe space below).\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to (8, 8).\nFrom there, continue navigating downwards towards the apples at (7,2) and (6,2). Be mindful of the enemy snake's potential reach, but for now, the priority is closing the apple gap (11 vs 7) and securing safe space.\n\nDOWN",

Moving here would cause self-collision. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT:** x=9, y=9. This is inside the board and currently empty (the board shows 'T' at 8,9 and 9,9, but 9,9 is empty). It is safe.\n*   **DOWN:** x=8, y=8. This is inside the board. The board shows '1' at (8,8), indicating my head is there (or the occupied cell logic implies (8,9) is head, (8,8) is currently empty because I moved up from there? No, wait. The board state *before* my move had my head at (8,8). I moved UP to (8,9). So (8,8) is now the neck, which is part of my body. However, the board description is static snapshot of the start of the turn. My current head is (8,9). My body follows: (8,8) is the next segment. So moving DOWN to (8,8) would move into my own neck. This is illegal (moving backwards into self). **DEAD.**\n\nWait, let me re-read the board state and my position carefully.\nMy position is: Head (8, 8), Body [(8, 9), (7, 9)...]. No, wait. The prompt says: \"My current position is (8, 8). No, I am at (8, 9).\" Wait, looking at the prompt:\n\"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (8, 8)\"\n\"My last move information: ... DOWN ... My previous move was UP to (8, 9). I am currently at (8, 9).\"\nThere is a contradiction in the prompt's description of \"current position\" in the header vs the \"Last Move Rationale\".\nHowever, the \"Last Move Rationale\" is the most recent state update logic. It says: \"My previous move was UP to (8, 9). I am currently at (8, 9).\" This implies the state has updated. The Board State visualization is the start of the turn visualization. If the Rationale says \"I am currently at (8, 9)\", I should trust that I am at (8, 9).\n\nLet's verify the board state visualization against the text:\nBoard:\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\nWait, the board shows `1` at x=8, y=8.\nCoordinates: (x, y) corresponding to (col, row).\nRow 8 (y=8): `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `1` `.` (cols 0-9).\nSo at (8,8), there is a `1`. This is my head.\nThe text says: \"My previous move was UP to (8, 9). I am currently at (8, 9).\"\nThis implies the visual board is outdated or I am reading the coordinates wrong.\nLet's check the coordinate system: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used... (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThe board is printed with Row 9 at the top, Row 0 at the bottom.\nSo Row 9 in the printout corresponds to y=9.\nRow 8 corresponds to y=8.\n\nBoard Row 8 (y=8): `1` is at column 8. So (8,8) is my head.\nBoard Row 9 (y=9): `T T` at columns 7 and 8. So (8,9) and (7,9) are Tail? Or parts of my body?\nThe text says: \"Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), ...]\".\nThis confirms (8,9) is part of my body.\nSo if my Head is (8,8) and Body starts (8,9), that means the body extends Up from the head.\nThis matches the board: Row 9 has `T T` at (7,9) and (8,9).\n\n**Conclusion:** The text \"I am currently at (8, 9)\" in the Rationale is likely a typo in the provided prompt data (copy-paste error from previous turn) or I am misinterpreting the Rationale's tense.\nFact: The board shows Head at (8,8). The listed Body starts at (8,9).\nIf I had just moved UP, my head would be at (8,9) and body (8,8).\nSince my head is (8,8) and body (8,9), I did NOT just move UP.\nDid I move DOWN? If I was at (8,9) and moved DOWN, I would be at (8,8), and body would be (8,9). This matches perfectly.\nThe Rationale says: \"My previous move was UP... My current position is (8,9).\" -> This contradicts the Board/Body list.\nBUT, the Rationale says: \"DOWN ... is safe ... To (8,8).\"\nWait, if I am at (8,9), moving DOWN lands on (8,8).\nIf I am at (8,8), moving DOWN lands on (8,7).\n\nLet's look at the Body list again: `[(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), ...]`.\nThis implies the snake is at:\nHead: (8, 8)\nNeck: (8, 9) (Wait, (8,9) is above (8,8)? No, y increases Up. So (8,9) is North of (8,8)).\nWait, if Head is (8,8) and Neck is (8,9), that means the neck is UP from the head. That is physically impossible in a continuous snake unless the head just moved DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8).\nOR, the Body list is not strictly ordered? \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head...\"\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (8, 8) - Body: [(8, 9), ...]\"\nThis is contradictory. Head is a tuple. Body is a list of tuples. The description usually lists \"Body\" as *excluding* the head, or including it?\n\"the first tuple is the head\". This usually refers to the *entire* snake list.\nLet's look at the Enemy Snake: \"Head: (5, 7), Body: [(6, 7), ...]\".\nIf (5,7) is head and (6,7) is first body part, they are adjacent (distance 1).\nIf My Head is (8,8) and My Body first element is (8,9), they are adjacent.\nIf (8,8) is Head, and (8,9) is next, then (8,9) is immediately behind the head.\nHowever, (8,9) is *above* (8,8) (y=9 > y=8).\nThis means the snake stretches downwards? No, (8,8) is lower.\nLet's assume the Rationale's statement \"I am currently at (8, 9)\" is a lie/error and the Board State is ground truth.\nBoard State shows `1` at (8,8).\nSo I am at (8,8).\nMy body follows: `(8,9)`, `(7,9)`.\nThis means the snake goes: Head (8,8) -> Neck (8,9) -> (7,9).\nThis means the \"Body\" list in the prompt description is actually `[Neck, ...]`.\nSince (8,9) is North of (8,8), the snake enters the head from the North.\nThis implies the Head was *previously* at (8,9) and moved DOWN to (8,8).\nThe Rationale says: \"My previous move was UP to (8, 9).\" -> This is definitely an error in the Rationale text. It should have been DOWN.\nHowever, the Rationale's *analysis* based on being at (8,9) might be flawed, but my current reality is what matters.\n\nLet's assume I am at (8,8).\n**Current Position:** (8, 8)\n**Body:** (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...\n**Moves:**\n1.  **UP:** (8, 9). This is occupied by my Body (Neck). **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN:** (8, 7). Is this safe?\n    - Board Row 7: `. T T T . 0 T T . A`\n    - Col 8, Row 7 (y=7): `.`. Empty.\n    - My body: (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)...\n    - (8,7) is not in my body. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT:** (7, 8). Is this safe?\n    - Board Row 8: `. . . . . . . T 1 .` -> Col 7 is `T`. This corresponds to my body part at (7,9)? No, Row 8 is y=8.\n    - Wait, the `T` in Row 8 is at Col 7? The printout: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    - Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    - Col 7 is `T`. So (7,8) is occupied.\n    - My body list: (7,8) is the 3rd element (index 2). Yes, (7,8) is part of my body. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT:** (9, 8). Is this safe?\n    - Board Row 8: `. . . . . . . T 1 .` -> Col 9 is `.`. Empty.\n    - My body does not contain (9,8). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to catch up to Snake #0 (11 apples vs 7).\nApples: (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (3,2), (9,7).\nClosest clusters: (6,3) & (6,2) & (7,2) are to the South-West (Down/Left).\n(9,7) is to the North-East (Right/Up).\n\nI am at (8,8).\nPath to (6,3):\n(8,8) -> (8,7) -> (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (7,4)... wait, my tail is at (7,4).\nMy tail is at (7,4). My body is (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4).\nIf I go DOWN:\nTurn 1: (8,8) -> (8,7). Tail moves from (7,4) to (7,3) (assuming no apple eaten).\nTurn 2: (8,7) -> (8,6). Tail moves to (7,2).\nWait, (7,2) is an apple!\nIf I go DOWN, I will eventually clear the path at (7,2) if I don't eat it.\nBut I want to eat it.\n\nLet's look at the Enemy Snake #0.\nHead: (5, 7).\nBody: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6)]\nIt is quite long.\nIt is at y=7, x=5.\nIt might go for the apples at (6,3), (6,2) or (3,2).\nDistance from Enemy Head (5,7) to (6,2): |5-6| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6.\nDistance from My Head (8,8) to (6,2): |8-6| + |8-2| = 2 + 6 = 8.\nThe enemy is closer to the bottom cluster.\nHowever, the enemy is long. It might block itself.\n\nDistance to (9,7):\nMe: |8-9| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nEnemy: |5-9| + |7-7| = 4 + 0 = 4.\nI am closer to (9,7).\n\n**Decision:**\nIf I go **DOWN (8,7)**:\n- I approach the bottom cluster.\n- From (8,7), I can see the path is somewhat open.\n- My body blocks the left side (x=7).\n- Enemy is at (5,7). Direct line of sight on x=5 vs x=8. Safe.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT (9,8)**:\n- I approach (9,7).\n- From (9,8), I am cornered (Wall at x=9, y=9). I can only go DOWN (to 9,7) or LEFT (to 8,8).\n- If I go to (9,7), I eat an apple.\n- Then I am at (9,7). From there, I can go DOWN (9,6) or LEFT (8,7).\n- The bottom cluster is far away.\n- The apple at (9,7) is isolated.\n- Going for (9,7) seems like a short-term gain but traps me in the corner.\n- The Rationale from the previous turn said: \"RIGHT to (9,9)... traps me in a corner.\" and rejected it. The same logic applies to (9,8).\n- Also, the enemy might chase me to the corner? Unlikely, but being trapped is generally bad.\n\n**DOWN** is the better move to keep options open and head towards the dense apple cluster.\nFrom (8,7), I can eventually turn LEFT at y=2 or y=3 to hit the apples at (6,3) etc.\nMy tail is currently at (7,4).\nIf I move DOWN to (8,7), my tail shifts to (7,3) (since length is 9 segments).\nThis clears (7,4) and (7,3).\nThe path downwards is clear.\n(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2) are all empty on the board.\nAt (8,3) there is an apple? No, apples are at (6,3), (6,2), (7,2).\nI can go DOWN to (8,2), then LEFT to (7,2) to eat the apple.\n\nCheck Enemy movement:\nSnake #0 at (5,7).\nPossible moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7).\nDOWN (5,6) is blocked by its own body (6,5)? No, (5,6) is in its body list.\nLEFT (4,7) is blocked? (4,6) is in body, (4,7) is empty on board.\nRIGHT (6,7) is blocked? (6,7) is first body segment.\nUP (5,8) is empty.\nSo Enemy has options. It might go UP or LEFT.\nIf it goes LEFT, it moves towards (3,2).\nIf it goes UP, it moves away.\nIt is unlikely to rush me immediately.\n\nSo, **DOWN** is the optimal move.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move DOWN to (8,7).\n2. Continue DOWN to clear space and position for Left turn.\n3. Target (7,2) or (6,2).\n\nDOWN",

This would result in a head at `(8,7)`. However, the current game state explicitly lists the head at `(8,6)`. This suggests the head actually moved `DOWN` from `(8,7)` to `(8,6)` (or the update is inconsistent). I must trust the explicit `Head: (8, 6)` data.\n*   **Immediate Environment (at (8,6)):**\n    *   **UP (8,7):** Contains my body segment `(8,7)`. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN (8,5):** The board shows `.` at `(8,5)`. This space is currently empty. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (7,6):** The board shows `T` at `(7,6)`. My body list confirms `(7,6)` is the tail. **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT (9,6):** The board shows `.` at `(9,6)`. This space is empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Target:** The nearest apples are in the bottom-right cluster: `(7,2)` and `(6,2)`. There is also an apple at `(6,3)`.\n*   **Path:** To reach `(7,2)`, I need to decrease my y-coordinate (move Down) and eventually move Left.\n*   **Option DOWN (8,5):** Moves me towards the apples. Keeps the path open. From `(8,5)`, I can move Down or Left.\n*   **Option RIGHT (9,6):** Moves me towards the wall. While safe momentarily, it corners me and moves me away from the primary apple cluster.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving `DOWN` is the only safe move that brings me closer to the apple cluster.

I am currently at `(8,4)`.\n1.  **DOWN (to 8,3)**: This aligns perfectly with the \"apple staircase\" (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (7,2). It creates a direct vertical path.\n2.  **LEFT (to 7,4)**: This is also a valid move to approach the cluster.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9,4)**: This moves away from the apples and traps me against the wall. Avoid.\n\nComparing **DOWN** and **LEFT**: Moving DOWN gets me to `y=3` immediately. From `(8,3)`, I can move LEFT to `(7,3)` next. From `(7,3)`, I can move DOWN to `(7,2)` (which has an apple) or LEFT to `(6,3)` (which has an apple). This creates a clear path to eat two apples quickly. Moving LEFT to `(7,4)` takes me longer to drop to `y=3` to reach the apples. Therefore, DOWN is the optimal move to close the distance to the nearest apples efficiently.\n\n**Final Move Decision:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

It continues the trajectory towards the apple cluster at the top of the board.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (Risk Assessment):**\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 9).\n*   **My Head:** (6, 3).\n*   **Distance:** Manhattan distance is |6-3| + |3-9| = 3 + 6 = 9.

Strategic Selection:**\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n*   **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   The enemy snake (Head at 3,8) is currently directly North of me (at 6,8 and 6,9) and has its head at x=3. To threaten a head-on collision on the next turn, the enemy would have to move RIGHT to (4,8). If I move UP to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,3), I increase the distance from the enemy's potential path. However, looking at the board map, the enemy is currently trapped in a \"box\" or at least surrounded by its own body at x=6. The only empty space visible in that row for the enemy is at x=7, but x=6 is full of its body. Wait, looking closer at the map:\n        *   Row 8: `. . . 0 T T T . T .`\n        *   The enemy head is at 3,8. The body segments fill 4,8; 5,8; 6,8.\n        *   The enemy's best move to survive or expand is likely towards the empty space or apples. The apples are at (9,7) and (2,7).\n    *   **My Position:** I am at (6,3). The closest apple is at (4,6), then (2,7).\n    *   **Long-term:** I need to loop around or find a path to the apples at the top-left. My current body blocks the right side (x=8).\n    *   **Move Option UP:** Moves to (6,4). Keeps me in line with the enemy's body at (6,8). If the enemy moves to x=7 or x=5 (if possible), I might get cut off.\n    *   **Move Option LEFT:** Moves to (5,3). This heads towards the apple at (4,6) and (2,7). It also moves me away from the column (x=6) where the enemy's body is currently stuck.\n    *   **Move Option RIGHT:** Moves to (7,3). This is towards my own body at (8,2...). It's a safe move for this turn, but might lead to a corner (9,3) or near my own tail which will move next turn.\n\n*   **Decision:** Moving **LEFT** seems the most proactive. It moves towards the apple cluster at (4,6) and (2,7) and away from the potential interaction zone at x=6. Moving UP leaves me potentially directly below the enemy's body, which can be risky if the enemy decides to drop down later. Moving RIGHT leads me towards my own tail.\n\n*   **Plan:** Move LEFT to (5,3) to approach the apples at (4,6) and (2,7). Monitor the enemy's movement; if they move right, I have space. If they move left/down, I can adjust.\n\n**4. Final Move Decision:**\nI will move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

They are currently \"boxed in\" by their own body to the right (at x=4, 5, 6 on row 7 and above).\n    *   **Apples:**\n        *   (3, 2): To my Left/Down.\n        *   (2, 7): Far Left/Up.\n        *   (3, 5): Left/Up.\n        *   (4, 6): Left/Up.\n        *   (9, 7): Far Right/Up.\n    *   **Current Position:** I am at (5, 3).\n        *   If I go **LEFT (4, 3)**: I approach the apple at (3, 2). This seems to be the nearest apple. I need to ensure I don't corner myself. My body occupies x=6..8, y=2..8. Moving left opens up the left side of the board (x=0..4).\n        *   If I go **UP (5, 4)**: I move horizontally parallel to my body stack at x=6..8. This keeps me aligned with the enemy's vertical body segment at x=6 (row 8/9). It doesn't get me closer to the nearest apple at (3, 2).\n\n*   **Decision:**\n    The apple at (3, 2) is the closest and easiest to secure. To get there from (5, 3), I must move Left. Moving Up deviates from this target. Moving Left brings me to (4, 3), putting me one step closer to (3, 3), then (3, 2). This path is clear of my own body (my body is strictly at x>=6). This path also stays away from the enemy's current position at x=3, y=7.\n\n*   **Plan:** Move LEFT to (4, 3) to secure the apple at (3, 2). Then navigate around the body of Snake #0 to reach the cluster of apples at (2,7), (3,5), (4,6).\n\n**4. Final Move Decision:**\nMove LEFT.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

My tail remains at $(8, 7)$. It will move to $(8, 6)$ on the next turn.\n    *   **Enemy #0:** Head $(2, 7)$. Body connecting to $(3, 7)$.\n    *   **Apples:** $(3, 2), (9, 7), (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Move Evaluation (from $(4, 3)$):**\n    *   **UP to $(4, 4)$:** The cell is `.` (Empty). No body collision. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to $(4, 2)$:** The cell contains `T` (My body). **KILLS ME**.\n    *   **LEFT to $(3, 3)$:** The cell is `.` (Empty). No body collision. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to $(5, 3)$:** The cell contains `T` (My body). **KILLS ME**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Selection:**\n    *   I am forced to choose between **UP** and **LEFT**.\n    *   **LEFT to $(3, 3)$:** This is the path towards the apple at $(3, 2)$. However, looking ahead:\n        *   If I go Left to $(3, 3)$, the turn after I would need to go Down to $(3, 2)$ to eat the apple.\n        *   If I go Left now, the turn after my tail moves from $(8, 7)$ to $(8, 6)$.\n        *   *Wait*, if I go **LEFT** now, then next turn I must go **DOWN** to get the apple at $(3, 2)$.\n        *   If I go **UP** now, I am at $(4, 4)$. From there, I can easily go **LEFT** to $(3, 4)$, then **LEFT** to $(2, 4)$, etc. This keeps my options open.\n    *   *Correction*: Let's look at the apple at $(3, 2)$ again. To get there from $(4, 3)$, I must go Left $(3, 3)$ then Down $(3, 2)$.\n    *   Let's check the **UP** move.\n        *   Move **UP** to $(4, 4)$.\n        *   Next turn, I can go **LEFT** to $(3, 4)$.\n        *   This avoids the \"trap\" of the narrow column near x=3, y=2 where my body might block me if I commit to the lower apple immediately.\n        *   Moving UP keeps the central area $(4, 6)$ and $(3, 5)$ as potential next targets.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the \"safe\" moves. Both are safe.\n    *   However, if I go **LEFT**, I am committing to the $(3, 2)$ apple. If the enemy decides to cut me off or if I miscalculate my tail movement, I might get trapped.\n    *   If I go **UP**, I keep the option to go Left towards $(3, 5)$ or $(4, 6)$ or even return to the path of $(3, 2)$ if I go Left then Down. Actually, moving Up first gives me more freedom to maneuver around the body of Snake #0 at $(2, 7)$.\n    *   Let's look at the board layout. The space at $x=3$ is tight. My body is at $x=6..8$. Moving to $x=3$ is moving deeper into the board. Moving **UP** stays in the open area at $x=4$.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   **UP** is the better move. It avoids the tight space near $x=3$ for now and keeps multiple future paths open. I can chase $(4, 6)$ or $(3, 5)$ or $(3, 2)$ more safely from a higher Y coordinate.\n    *   **LEFT** is a trap. While it gets me closer to $(3, 2)$, it forces a Down move next, which might be dangerous or restrictive.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move UP to $(4, 4)$ to maintain flexibility. From there, I will likely move Left towards $(4, 6)$ or $(3, 5)$. I need to avoid Snake #0 at $(2, 7)$.\n\nUP",

On this turn, the tail moves to `(8, 4)`, clearing `(8, 5)`.\n\n2.  **Enemy State (Snake #0):**\n    *   **Head:** `(3, 6)`\n    *   **Body:** `[(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)]`\n    *   **Movement:** The tail is `(4, 7)`. It will move to `(4, 6)`. The head is `(3, 6)`.\n    *   **Threat:** Snake #0 is directly North of me at `(3, 6)`. If Snake #0 moves Down, it lands on `(3, 5)`. If it moves Down *and* I move Up, we collide. If Snake #0 moves Down and I move Up, we both die. I cannot guarantee Snake #0 will not move Down (it is a valid move towards the apple at `(3, 5)`).\n\n3.  **Safe Moves Evaluation (from `(3, 4)`):**\n    *   **UP to `(3, 5)`:** Contains an apple. **DANGER:** Potential head-on collision with Snake #0 if it moves Down to `(3, 5)`. If I die, I lose. If we tie, I lose because Snake #0 has more apples (12 vs 10).\n    *   **DOWN to `(3, 3)`:** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to `(2, 4)`:** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to `(4, 4)`:** Contained in my body. **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   To ensure survival (the primary condition to win), I must avoid the 50% chance of death (or worse, the mutually assured destruction where I lose the tie-breaker) by moving Up into `(3, 5)`.\n    *   **LEFT** to `(2, 4)` is a safe move. It keeps me close to the apples at `(3, 5)` and `(3, 2)`. It also moves me towards the left side of the board, potentially boxing in Snake #0 (which is currently at `(3, 6)`). By moving Left, I remain flexible. I can go Up on the next turn if Snake #0 moves away or goes East.\n    *   **DOWN** to `(3, 3)` is safe but moves me away from the nearest apple at `(3, 5)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I will move **LEFT** to `(2, 4)`. This guarantees I survive Turn 66. If Snake #0 moves Down to `(3, 5)`, I will be at `(2, 4)` watching him. If he moves Up or Right, I can go Up to `(3, 5)` on Turn 67. This is the only winning move against a competent opponent.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to `(2, 4)` to avoid the potential collision at `(3, 5)`. Wait for Snake #0 to commit to a direction. If he clears `(3, 5)`, eat it next turn. If he stays or blocks, maneuver around him.\n\nLEFT",

I moved LEFT from `(3, 4)` as planned. My body follows: `[(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), ...]`. The tail is at `(8, 5)`.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** The head is at `(4, 6)`. Based on my last rationale, I anticipated the enemy at `(3, 6)` moving to `(3, 5)` (Down). Let's verify if this happened.\n    *   **Previous Enemy Head:** `(3, 6)`.\n    *   **Hypothetical Enemy Move (Down):** Would land at `(3, 5)`.\n    *   **Actual Enemy Head:** `(4, 6)`.\n    *   **Actual Enemy Body:** Includes `(3, 6)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The enemy moved **RIGHT** to `(4, 6)`. It did **not** move Down to `(3, 5)`. Consequently, the danger I anticipated (head-on collision at `(3, 5)`) did not materialize. The cell `(3, 5)` is currently empty (based on the \"Apples at\" list, there is an apple there, but the board display shows a `.` at `(3, 5)` in the 5th row, which is y=5. Wait, the board says `5 . . . A . . . . . .`. The `A` is at column 3, row 5. So `(3, 5)` has an apple. The enemy moved Right, avoiding it.\n\n**Board Status Check (Turn 67):**\n*   **My position:** `(2, 4)`.\n*   **Apple at:** `(3, 5)`. This is North of me.\n*   **Apple at:** `(3, 2)`. This is South-West of me.\n*   **Apple at:** `(5, 1)`. This is South-East.\n*   **Enemy position:** Head at `(4, 6)`. Body at `(3, 6), (2, 6)...`. The enemy is North-East of me.\n\n**Move Evaluation (from `(2, 4)`):**\n\n1.  **UP to `(2, 5)`:**\n    *   Checks: `(2, 5)` is on the board.\n    *   Body: `[(3, 4), ...]`. `(2, 5)` is not in my body.\n    *   Enemy: The enemy head is at `(4, 6)`. The enemy body includes `(2, 6)`. It does not include `(2, 5)`.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the apple at `(3, 5)`. If I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I will be adjacent to the apple. However, the enemy is at `(4, 6)`. If the enemy moves Left (to `(3, 6)`) and then Down (to `(3, 5)`), we might conflict. But for *this* turn, `(2, 5)` is safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to `(2, 3)`:**\n    *   Checks: `(2, 3)` is on the board.\n    *   Body: `(3, 4)` is the next segment. `(2, 3)` is not `(3, 4)`. Safe.\n    *   Enemy: Enemy at `(4, 6)`, `(3, 6)`, `(2, 6)`. Safe.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards `(3, 2)` apple. I currently have `(3, 4)` in my body, blocking the direct path East. Going Down keeps options open.\n\n3.  **LEFT to `(1, 4)`:**\n    *   Checks: `(1, 4)` is on the board.\n    *   Body: Safe.\n    *   Enemy: Safe.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the left wall. Not helpful for apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to `(3, 4)`:**\n    *   Checks: `(3, 4)` is the **second segment** of my body. If I move here, I hit myself.\n    *   **Safety:** **ILLEGAL / DEATH**.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP:** Gets me closer to apple `(3, 5)`. Risks collision if enemy moves aggressively.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves me towards apple `(3, 2)`. The path is currently blocked by my own body at `(3, 4)`, but by going Down, I open up the option to go East on the next turn (since I'll be at `(2, 3)` or similar).\n*   **LEFT:** Detour.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI need to close the gap with Snake #0 (13 apples vs 10). The apple at `(3, 5)` is the closest. However, the enemy is positioned at `(4, 6)` which is a threat. If I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am ready to grab `(3, 5)` next turn unless the enemy intercepts. The enemy is currently at `(4, 6)`. The distance to `(3, 5)` for the enemy is sqrt(2). For me (at `(2, 4)` to `(3, 5)`), distance is sqrt(2). It's a tie. However, I am already aligned to move there. The enemy would have to move Left and Down. I can move Up and then Right. We would arrive at the same time. That's a head-on collision. I must avoid that. The enemy is winning. If we tie, I lose.\nStrategy: Wait for the enemy to commit. The enemy moved Right, away from the `(3, 5)` apple. Maybe they are going for `(9, 7)` or `(5, 1)`. If I stay safe, I can take `(3, 5)`. Let's move UP to get closer. If the enemy moves Left/Down, I will see it next turn and can choose a different path (e.g., Down to `(2, 3)`). Going UP is the aggressive move towards the apple.\n\nWait, let me re-read the enemy body. `(3, 6), (2, 6)...`. The enemy is effectively a wall between y=6 and y=9. If I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am right next to the enemy body at `(2, 6)`. If the enemy moves Down, the segment at `(2, 6)` will move to `(2, 5)`. If I am at `(2, 5)`, I will be crushed.\nLet's trace the enemy movement logic.\nCurrent Enemy Head: `(4, 6)`.\nCurrent Enemy Body: `(3, 6), (2, 6)...`\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (to `(3, 6)`): The body moves into the head's old spot. `(2, 6)` moves to `(3, 6)`? No, the whole body shifts.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (to `(4, 5)`): Safe? Yes.\nIf Enemy moves UP (to `(4, 7)`): Safe? Yes.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (to `(5, 6)`): Safe? Yes.\n\nIf I move UP to `(2, 5)`:\n*   If Enemy moves DOWN (to `(4, 5)`): I am at `(2, 5)`, Enemy at `(4, 5)`. Safe.\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT (to `(3, 6)`): I am at `(2, 5)`. The segment `(2, 6)` moves to `(3, 6)`. Wait, if Enemy moves Left, the head goes `(4, 6)` -> `(3, 6)`. The body segment `(3, 6)` goes to `(4, 6)`. The body segment `(2, 6)` goes to `(3, 6)`. So `(2, 6)` becomes empty. I am at `(2, 5)`. I am safe. The only danger is if the Enemy Head moves to `(2, 5)`. But the Enemy Head is at `(4, 6)`. It cannot reach `(2, 5)` in one turn.\n\nSo moving UP is safe. And it positions me for the apple.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 4: `4 . . 1 T T . . . T .`\nMy body is at `(3, 4)` and `(4, 4)`.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am at `(2, 5)`.\nMy body will be `(2, 4), (3, 4)...`.\nI am creating a path away from the body.\n\nLet's consider DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\nRow 3: `3 . . . A T T T . T .`\n`(2, 3)` is empty. My body is `(3, 4)`.\nThis moves me towards the apple at `(3, 2)` (Row 2).\nIf I go DOWN, my body will be `(2, 3), (3, 4)...`.\nThis seems slightly safer than UP because it moves away from the main enemy cluster at y=6.\nHowever, the apple at `(3, 5)` is closer to the enemy (distance 1.4) than me (distance 2.8).\nThe apple at `(3, 2)` is closer to me.\nBut I want points.\nThe enemy has 13 apples. I have 10.\nIf I take `(3, 5)`, I get 11.\nIf the enemy takes another apple, they might win before me.\nI must be careful.\n\nLet's look at the board drawing again.\nRow 7: `7 . . T T T . . . . A`\nRow 6: `6 . . T T 0 . . . .`\nRow 5: `5 . . . A . . . . . .`\nRow 4: `4 . . 1 T T . . . T .`\nRow 3: `3 . . . A T T T . T .`\nRow 2: `2 . . . A . . T T T .`\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . A . . . .`\n\nThere is an apple at `(5, 1)`. Row 1, col 5.\nThere is an apple at `(3, 2)`.\nThere is an apple at `(3, 5)`.\nThere is an apple at `(9, 7)`.\n\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`. The enemy body blocks `(3, 6)` and `(2, 6)`.\nI am at `(2, 4)`.\n\nIf I move UP to `(2, 5)`:\nI am next to the enemy body wall at `(2, 6)`.\nIf the enemy moves, the body shifts. I am safe *this turn*.\nBut next turn, I might be vulnerable if the enemy moves down into the space I am about to enter? No, I am entering `(2, 5)` now. Next turn I will be at `(2, 5)` (if I stay) or move somewhere else. The enemy cannot reach `(2, 5)` easily.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Apple at (3, 5)\".\nMy last move was LEFT to `(2, 4)`.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am at `(2, 5)`.\nIf I go RIGHT (to `(3, 5)`), I can eat the apple.\nWait, can I go RIGHT?\nFrom `(2, 4)`, Right is `(3, 4)`.\n`(3, 4)` is currently my second body segment (Head was at `(2, 4)` -> `(3, 4)`).\nSo RIGHT is into my own body. Forbidden.\n\nSo I must go UP or DOWN or LEFT.\nUP puts me at `(2, 5)`.\nDOWN puts me at `(2, 3)`.\n\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`.\nNext turn, I could go RIGHT to `(3, 5)` to eat the apple.\nAt that time, my body will be `(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)...`.\nThe move RIGHT to `(3, 5)` will be safe (assuming no enemy there).\nIs `(3, 5)` safe?\nCurrently empty.\nIf I go UP now, the enemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nNext turn, the enemy moves.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, it goes to `(4, 5)`.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, it goes to `(3, 6)`.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN-LEFT, it's impossible in one turn.\nIf I go UP now, and the enemy goes DOWN (to `(4, 5)`), then on the next turn I can go RIGHT to `(3, 5)`. I am safe.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT (to `(3, 6)`), I am at `(2, 5)`. I am safe.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN-LEFT (impossible).\nThe only danger is if the enemy moves to `(3, 5)` next turn.\nFrom `(4, 6)`, to reach `(3, 5)` in one turn (Next turn) requires Left+Down. Impossible.\nSo if I am at `(2, 5)` at the start of next turn, the enemy CANNOT reach `(3, 5)` next turn.\nTherefore, going UP now sets me up to eat `(3, 5)` for sure on the next turn (Turn 68).\nThis seems like a very strong move.\nI just need to make sure that *this* move (UP to `(2, 5)`) is safe.\nIs `(2, 5)` safe?\nMy body is at `(3, 4)`. Safe.\nEnemy body is at `(3, 6)` and `(2, 6)`. Safe.\nEnemy head is at `(4, 6)`. Safe.\nSo `(2, 5)` is safe.\n\nAlternative: DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\nThis moves towards the apple at `(3, 2)`.\nThis also moves away from the enemy.\nBut it gives up the guaranteed apple at `(3, 5)` next turn (if I go UP now).\nSince I am behind (10 vs 13), I need to take apples.\nThe apple at `(3, 5)` is the easiest and safest to take.\nMoving UP secures it.\nMoving DOWN delays it and gives the enemy a chance to block or take it (though they can't reach it next turn from current pos).\n\nWait, let's check the board for obstacles near `(2, 5)`.\nRow 5: `5 . . . A . . . . . .`\nRow 5, Col 2 is `.`. Col 1 `.`. Col 0 `.`.\nRow 5, Col 3 is `A` (at `(3, 5)`).\nRow 5, Col 4 is `.`.\nSo `(2, 5)` is definitely empty.\n\nLet's double check the enemy body locations.\n`[(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)]`\nHeads `(4, 6)`.\nSo `(3, 6)` and `(2, 6)` are occupied.\nMy move UP to `(2, 5)` puts me at y=5. Enemy body is at y=6. Safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1.  Move UP to `(2, 5)`.\n2.  On Turn 68, move RIGHT to `(3, 5)` to eat the apple.\n3.  Continue from there.\n\nWhy is this better than moving DOWN towards `(3, 2)`?\n`(3, 2)` is also an apple.\nMy body is currently blocking a direct path to it.\nHead at `(2, 4)`.\nPath to `(3, 2)`: `(2, 4)` -> `(2, 3)` -> `(2, 2)` -> `(3, 2)`.\nOr `(2, 4)` -> `(2, 3)` -> `(3, 3)` -> `(3, 2)`.\nHowever, `(3, 3)` is blocked by my body or enemy?\nBoard: Row 3 `3 . . . A T T T . T .`\n`(3, 3)` is `A` (Apple). `(3, 4)` is `T` (Tail/Body).\nWait, my body is at `(3, 4)`.\nSo `(3, 3)` is an apple.\nWait, the board shows `(3, 3)` as `A`?\nRow 3: `3 . . . A T T T . T .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nSo (0,3) `.` (1,3) `.` (2,3) `.` (3,3) `A` (4,3) `T` (5,3) `T` ...\nYes, `(3, 3)` is an apple.\nMy body is at `(3, 4)`.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`, I am at `(2, 3)`.\nNext turn, I could go RIGHT to `(3, 3)` to eat that apple.\nSo I have TWO options for the next turn.\nOption A: Go UP to `(2, 5)`, then eat `(3, 5)`.\nOption B: Go DOWN to `(2, 3)`, then eat `(3, 3)`.\n\nLet's compare the options.\nCurrent Position: `(2, 4)`.\nEnemy: `(4, 6)`.\n\nOption A: UP to `(2, 5)`.\nThreat: Enemy at `(4, 6)`. Enemy body at `(3, 6)`, `(2, 6)`.\nIf Enemy moves Left to `(3, 6)`: Safe.\nIf Enemy moves Down to `(4, 5)`: Safe.\nIf Enemy moves Down-Left (impossible).\nIf Enemy moves Right to `(5, 6)`: Safe.\nIf Enemy moves Up to `(4, 7)`: Safe.\nResult: Safe. Gets closer to `(3, 5)`.\n\nOption B: DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\nThreat: Enemy at `(4, 6)`.\nIf Enemy moves: It's far away.\nResult: Safe. Gets closer to `(3, 3)`.\n\nComparison of Apples:\n`(3, 5)` vs `(3, 3)`.\nDistance is similar.\nHowever, looking at the map, there is an apple at `(5, 1)` which is South-East.\nAnd an apple at `(3, 2)` which is South-West.\nThere is an apple at `(9, 7)` which is far North-East.\nThere is an apple at `(9, 7)` and `(9, 8)` is `.` but `(9, 9)` is `T`.\nActually, looking at the enemy map:\n`9 . . . T T T T . . .`\n`8 . . . T T T T . . .`\n`7 . . T T T . . . . A`\nThe apple at `(9, 7)` is surrounded by `.` on the board (except `(9, 7)` is `A`).\nWait, Row 7: `7 . . T T T . . . . A`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nSo `(7, 9)` is `A`.\nMy head `(2, 4)`. The apple `(9, 7)` is far away (x=9, y=7).\nTo get there, I need to go Right and Up.\nTo go Right, I have to clear my body at `(3, 4), (4, 4)...`.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I can eventually go Right through the top.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`, I go deeper into the bottom left.\n\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`. The enemy is blocking the center.\nI am at `(2, 4)`.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am effectively \"above\" the enemy's current position, but he is at y=6 and I am at y=5.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy and the high-value apples at the top (like `(9, 7)`).\nBut `(3, 5)` and `(3, 3)` are close.\n\nThe winning condition is mostly about apples.\nI have 10, enemy has 13.\nI need apples.\n`(3, 5)` is an apple.\n`(3, 3)` is an apple.\nI can get one of them next turn.\nWhy choose UP over DOWN?\nIf I go UP, I am at `(2, 5)`.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at `(2, 3)`.\nThe difference is 2 units of Y.\nThe apple at `(3, 5)` is at Y=5.\nThe apple at `(3, 3)` is at Y=3.\nThey are equally distant relative to my current Y=4.\nHowever, there is an apple at `(5, 1)` at Y=1.\nGoing DOWN puts me closer to that.\nBut `(5, 1)` is blocked by my own body?\nMy body is `(6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2)...`.\n`(5, 1)` is at `(5, 1)`.\nThe path to `(5, 1)` is potentially open if I snake around.\nThe path to `(3, 2)` (another apple) is also open.\n\nWait, I missed an apple.\nApples: `(3, 2)`, `(9, 7)`, `(3, 5)`, `(5, 1)`, `(3, 3)`.\n`(3, 2)` is at y=2.\n`(3, 3)` is at y=3.\nSo there are apples at y=2, 3, 5.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`, I am adjacent to `(3, 3)` (apple) and `(3, 2)` (apple).\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am adjacent to `(3, 5)` (apple).\n\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nThe enemy has 13 apples.\nI need to catch up.\nTaking `(3, 5)` seems slightly safer because the enemy is at `(4, 6)` (y=6) and `(3, 6)` (y=6).\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)` (y=5), I am \"under\" the enemy's body at `(2, 6)`? No, (2,6) is North.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)` (y=3), I am far away.\n\nLet's look at the board structure again.\n`4 . . 1 T T . . . T .`\n`3 . . . A T T T . T .`\n`2 . . . A . . T T T .`\n`1 . . . . . A . . . .`\n\nMy body creates a wall in the bottom right.\nThe enemy is in the top center.\nThe apples are in the center/bottom center.\nI have the \"left\" side of the board (x=0, 1, 2) relatively open.\nIf I go UP to `(2, 5)`, I am at `2,5`.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`, I am at `2,3`.\n\nLet's consider the \"Long term plan\" requested.\nIf I go UP:\nI get `(3, 5)` next turn.\nThen I am at `(3, 5)`.\nMy body is `(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4)`.\nFrom `(3, 5)`, I can go to `(3, 6)`. But `(3, 6)` is enemy body.\nI can go to `(4, 5)`. That is empty.\nI can go to `(2, 5)` (backwards).\nI can go to `(3, 4)` (backwards).\nSo I am effectively stuck in a small area unless I move OUT.\n`(3, 5)` is a \"dead end\" if `(3, 6)` is blocked and `(4, 5)` leads somewhere but `4,6` is enemy head.\nActually, if I eat `(3, 5)`:\nHead at `(3, 5)`.\nBody: `(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)`.\nNext moves:\n- Down: `(3, 4)` (Tail/Body). Safe (tail moves).\n- Left: `(2, 5)` (Body). Safe (if I don't stay there, but I can't go back to start).\n- Up: `(3, 6)`. Enemy body. Die.\n- Right: `(4, 5)`. Safe? `4, 5` is `.` on board.\nSo from `(3, 5)`, I can go Right to `(4, 5)`.\nThen `(5, 5)`? `5 . . . A . . . . . .` -> `(5, 5)` is `.`.\nSo I can snake Rightwards towards the right side of the board.\nThis is good. It opens up the path to `(9, 7)` eventually.\n\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`:\nI eat `(3, 3)` next turn.\nHead at `(3, 3)`.\nBody: `(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)`.\nFrom `(3, 3)`:\n- Down: `(3, 2)` (Apple). Open.\n- Up: `(3, 4)` (Body).\n- Left: `(2, 3)` (Body).\n- Right: `(4, 3)`. `4, 3` is `T` (Body). `4,3` is `(4,3)` in my body.\nWait, `(4, 3)` is in my body. Yes, `4, 3` is `T` on board.\nSo Right is blocked.\nSo from `(3, 3)`, I am forced to go Down to `(3, 2)` to eat the apple there.\nThen from `(3, 2)`:\n- Down: `(3, 1)` (`.`).\n- Up: `(3, 3)` (Body).\n- Left: `(2, 2)` (`.`).\n- Right: `(4, 2)`. `4, 2` is `.`? `2 . . . A . . T T T .` -> `(4, 2)` is `.`.\nSo I have options.\n\nThe UP strategy gets me to `(3, 5)` and then I can move Right into the open space `4,5 -> 5,5...`\nThe DOWN strategy gets me to `(3, 3)` then `(3, 2)`. I might get trapped at the bottom left (0,0).\nAlso, there is an apple at `(5, 1)` which is easily reached from the DOWN path.\nHowever, the UP path opens the right side of the board where there are no obstacles (except my own tail).\n\nThe most important thing is to get points.\nIf I go UP now, I guarantee `(3, 5)` next turn.\nIf I go DOWN now, I guarantee `(3, 3)` next turn, and potentially `(3, 2)` the turn after.\nTotal potential: 2 apples.\nThe UP path guarantees 1 apple immediately and maybe more.\nThe DOWN path guarantees 2 apples.\nWait, why does UP only guarantee 1?\nFrom `(3, 5)`, I go Right to `(4, 5)`.\nIs there an apple at `(5, 5)`? No.\nThe next apple is `(9, 7)`. It's far.\nThe next apple is `(5, 1)`. It's far.\nThe DOWN path has two apples at `(3, 3)` and `(3, 2)` right next to each other.\nSo the DOWN path seems to have a denser cluster of apples.\n\nLet's re-read the board.\n`3 . . . A T T T . T .`\n`2 . . . A . . T T T .`\n`(3, 2)` is Apple.\n`(3, 3)` is Apple.\nThese are right there.\nMy current position `(2, 4)`.\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to `(3, 3)` (Apple).\nThen I am at `(3, 3)`.\nMy body: `(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)...`\nFrom `(3, 3)`, I can go DOWN to `(3, 2)` (Apple).\nThis gets me 2 apples in 2 turns.\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nThe enemy has 13 apples.\nI need to close the gap. 2 apples gets me to 12.\nI will still be behind, but closer.\nIf I take the UP path, I get 1 apple, then I have to go Right. Where is the next apple? `(9, 7)`. Too far. `(5, 1)`. Too far.\nThe DOWN path is definitely more resource-rich in the short term.\n\nHowever, is it safe?\nIf I go DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\nEnemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nEnemy moves.\nCan the enemy reach `(3, 3)` or `(3, 2)`?\nNo, too far.\nCan the enemy reach me at `(2, 3)`?\nNo.\nSo it is safe.\n\nSo why did I initially think UP?\nThe last rationale said: \"He moved Right, away from the apple. I can take it.\"\nThat was referring to `(3, 5)`.\nBut `(3, 3)` and `(3, 2)` are also apples.\n`(3, 5)` is closer to the enemy starting position? No.\n`(3, 5)` is at Y=5. Enemy is at Y=6.\n`(3, 3)` is at Y=3. Enemy is at Y=6.\nThe enemy has to travel 3 units to reach `(3, 3)` and 1 unit to reach `(3, 5)`.\nSo `(3, 5)` is in much higher danger from the enemy.\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`. If it moves DOWN to `(4, 5)`, then DOWN to `(4, 4)`, then DOWN to `(4, 3)`...\nActually, if the enemy moves DOWN, it goes `(4, 6) -> (4, 5)`.\nIf I am at `(2, 5)` (after moving UP), I am safe.\nIf I am at `(3, 5)` (next turn), I am safe from immediate collision if he is at `(4, 5)`.\nBut if he moves DOWN-LEFT (impossible).\n\nLet's stick to the DOWN path because of the apple density.\nPath:\n1.  Turn 67: Move DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\n2.  Turn 68: Move RIGHT to `(3, 3)` (Eat Apple). Score 11.\n3.  Turn 69: Move DOWN to `(3, 2)` (Eat Apple). Score 12.\n\nThis is a solid plan.\nI need to make sure `RIGHT` from `(2, 3)` is safe on Turn 68.\nAt that time, my body will be `(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)`.\nSo `(3, 3)` will be empty. Safe.\nI need to make sure `DOWN` from `(3, 3)` is safe on Turn 69.\nAt that time, my body will be `(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)`.\nSo `(3, 2)` will be empty. Safe.\n\nThe only risk is the enemy moving aggressively to cut me off.\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nTo cut me off at `(3, 3)`, he would need to be at `(3, 2)` or `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)` or `(4, 3)`.\nImpossible in 2 turns.\n\nLet's reconsider the UP path.\nTurn 67: UP to `(2, 5)`.\nTurn 68: RIGHT to `(3, 5)` (Eat Apple).\nScore 11.\nTurn 69: Where to go? `(4, 5)`.\nIs there an apple? No.\nI would have to go `(4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5)...`\nEventually I see `(9, 7)` or `(5, 1)`.\nThe apple at `(5, 1)` is at `(5, 1)`.\nFrom `(6, 5)`, going to `(5, 1)` requires 4 Down and 1 Left.\nThe apple at `(9, 7)` requires 3 Right and 2 Up.\nThe apple at `(9, 7)` is also surrounded by empty space (Row 7: `7 . . T T T . . . . A`).\nThe enemy is at `(4, 6)`.\nThe enemy is also \"stuck\" in the top left-ish area (with the T's at 3, 4, 5, 6).\nWait, the enemy body surrounds `(3, 6)` to `(6, 9)`.\nThe enemy is effectively blocked from the right side by its own body?\nNo, the head is at `(4, 6)`. The body extends to `(6, 9)`.\nThe gap at `(7, 6)` is `.`.\nSo the enemy can go to `(5, 6)`, `(6, 6)`, etc.\nThe enemy can reach `(9, 7)` easily.\nI am at `(2, 4)`. I am far from `(9, 7)`.\nIf I go UP, I am even further East (relative to left side), but still far from `(9, 7)`.\nIf I go DOWN, I am going away from `(9, 7)`.\nHowever, I don't need to race to `(9, 7)` if I can eat the apples in the center.\nThere are 3 apples in the center: `(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)`.\nI can eat 2 of them easily if I go DOWN.\n`(3, 2)` and `(3, 3)`.\n`(3, 5)` is risky because enemy is close.\nSo grabbing the bottom two is the smart play.\nI have 10 apples. Enemy has 13.\nI need 40 to win.\nI need every apple I can get.\nThe bottom apples are safer.\n\nSo, the decision is:\nMove DOWN to `(2, 3)`.\n\nOne check: My body is `(3, 4)`.\nMoving DOWN from `(2, 4)` to `(2, 3)`.\n`(2, 3)` is empty on the board (Row 3: `3 . . . A ...`).\nSo it is empty.\n\nWait, is there any snake at `(2, 3)`?\nMy body is `[(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)]`.\nNo `(2, 3)`.\nEnemy body: `(3, 6), (2, 6)...`. No `(2, 3)`.\nEnemy head: `(4, 6)`.\nSo `(2, 3)` is safe.\n\nFinal check on \"Long term plan\".\nThis plan is for the next few turns.\n\"Move DOWN to (2, 3) to secure the apple cluster at (3,3) and (3,2). This avoids the dangerous (3,5) apple which is close to the enemy.\"\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\n`2,4` -> `2,3`. Down. Correct.\n\nIs there any other danger?\nMy tail is at `(8, 5)`.\nIf I move to `(2, 3)`, the tail will move to `(8, 4)`.\nNo risk of hitting my tail.\n\nDouble check the board state provided.\n`4 . . 1 T T . . . T .`\n`3 . . . A T T T . T .`\nMy head is `1` at `(2, 4)`.\n`2, 4` is `.`.\nWait, `4 . . 1 T T ...`\nIndices: 0 `.` 1 `.` 2 `1` 3 `T` ...\nSo `(2, 4)` is the `1`.\n`(3, 4)` is `T`.\n`(4, 4)` is `T`.\nSo the body is `(3, 4), (4, 4)`.\nYes, matches the provided body list.\n`Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), ...]`\nSo moving DOWN to `(2, 3)` is valid.\nRow 3 is `3 . . . A T T T . T .`\nIndices: 0 `.` 1 `.` 2 `.` 3 `A` ...\nSo `(2, 3)` is `.`. Empty. Safe.\n\nSo the move is DOWN.\n\nOne final thought: The apple at `(3, 5)` is at y=5.\nThe apple at `(3, 3)` is at y=3.\nThe apple at `(3, 2)` is at y=2.\nThe enemy is at y=6.\nIf I am at y=3 or y=2, I am farther from the enemy than if I am at y=5.\nBeing farther from the enemy is generally safer.\nSo DOWN is safer.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nThe final output must be one word.\nDOWNMoving DOWN to (2, 3) sets up a sequence to safely consume the apples at (3, 3) and (3, 2) over the next two turns. This avoids the dangerous apple at (3, 5), which is within immediate reach of the enemy snake at (4, 6). While the UP move towards (3, 5) is possible, it risks a head-on collision where I would lose on apples. The DOWN move is safer and allows me to close the apple gap (currently 10 vs 13) by securing two easy apples.\n\nDOWN",
