Next turn from (4, 2), possible moves: UP to (4, 3), DOWN to (4, 1) [has apple], LEFT to (3, 2), RIGHT to (5, 2) but that\u2019s my new body \u2014 not allowed (would die). So 3 safe moves next turn, one leads to another apple at (4, 1).  \n\nOther moves (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) don\u2019t get an apple immediately, but keep all 4 directions open next turn since still length 1.  \n\n**Strategy:**  \nEating apple early is beneficial unless it traps me. Here, going LEFT to (4, 2) still leaves 3 safe moves next turn, one of which is toward another apple at (4, 1). That\u2019s good.  \n\nAlso, if I go LEFT, enemy is far away, no head-on risk.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe just ate apple at (4, 2), body at (5, 2). Next turn from (4, 2), avoid moving RIGHT into own body. Consider DOWN to (4, 1) to eat another apple if safe, else UP or LEFT to explore. Keep away from enemy snake until necessary.  \n\nLEFT",

This positions me to potentially collect the nearby apple at (3, 7) on the next turn if the other snake doesn't go for it.\n \nTo the LEFT there is an apple at (2, 6), but I judge that the enemy snake may opt to go for that one since it is slightly closer to it than I am. I want to prioritize apples that only I can get. Moving DOWN would keep me alive but not advance me towards any apples. Going UP is not an option as it would take me off the board.\n\nBy moving RIGHT, I keep my options open - I can go for the (3,7) apple next or change plans if the enemy snake's actions make that risky. I stay equidistant to the apples at (1,7) and (4, 2) compared to my opponent in case I go for those instead.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMoving RIGHT positions me nearer to a reachable apple at (3,7) while keeping my options open and avoiding a potential collision near the apple at (2,6) that the enemy snake may also target this turn.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves: UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), LEFT (4, 8), RIGHT (6, 8).  \nAll are safe for enemy (no bodies anywhere).  \nEnemy might move toward nearest apple: nearest apples are (2, 6) or (3, 7) or (1, 7).  \n(3, 7) is at distance |5-3|=2 in x, |8-7|=1 in y \u2192 total 3.  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (5, 7) then LEFT toward (3, 7).  \n\nBut enemy is far from me, so head-on collision risk this turn is negligible (our heads can\u2019t meet in 1 move from these positions).  \n\n---\n\n**My safe moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 1)** \u2013 eats apple, grows to length 3. New head at (4, 1), body will be [(4, 2), (5, 2)].  \nNext turn from (4, 1), possible moves: UP to (4, 2) (my body \u2013 invalid), DOWN to (4, 0) safe, LEFT to (3, 1) safe, RIGHT to (5, 1) safe. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**UP to (4, 3)** \u2013 no apple, length stays 2. Next turn from (4, 3), possible moves: UP to (4, 4) safe, DOWN to (4, 2) (my body \u2013 invalid), LEFT to (3, 3) safe, RIGHT to (5, 3) safe \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (3, 2)** \u2013 no apple, length stays 2. Next turn from (3, 2), possible moves: UP to (3, 3) safe, DOWN to (3, 1) safe, LEFT to (2, 2) safe, RIGHT to (4, 2) (my body \u2013 invalid) \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo all three safe moves leave 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (4, 1) is 1 step DOWN.  \n- (2, 6), (3, 7), (1, 7), (2, 9) are farther.  \n\nEating apple now grows my length, which helps protect against head-on collisions later (if enemy runs into my body, they die). Also increases my score.  \n\n---\n\n**Potential risk of DOWN:**  \nIf I eat apple at (4, 1), my body occupies (4, 2) and (5, 2). Enemy is far away, so no immediate risk.  \n\nLonger-term: eating apple now might slightly reduce my future mobility near (4, 1) because body behind me, but that\u2019s normal growth tradeoff.  \n\n---\n\n**Which move best for future apple access?**  \nFrom (4, 1) after eating apple: apples left are (2, 6), (3, 7), (1, 7), (2, 9). Closest is (2, 6) at distance |4-2|=2, |1-6|=5 \u2192 total 7.  \nFrom (4, 3) after moving UP: closest apple is (2, 6) distance |4-2|=2, |3-6|=3 \u2192 total 5.  \nFrom (3, 2) after moving LEFT: closest apple is (2, 6) distance |3-2|=1, |2-6|=4 \u2192 total 5.  \n\nSo UP or LEFT gets me slightly closer to remaining apples than DOWN after growth, but DOWN gives me +1 apple now.  \n\nGiven early game, collecting apples quickly is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy path considerations:**  \nEnemy might eventually come down toward apples at (2, 6), (3, 7), etc. If I go LEFT to (3, 2), I\u2019m moving toward those apples too, possible head-on risk in a few turns. But right now it\u2019s safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take the apple now for growth and score advantage.  \n\nDOWN  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nWe will be at (4, 1), body at (4, 2), (5, 2). Avoid UP into own body. Consider LEFT or RIGHT to open space, maybe toward apples (2, 6) or (3, 7) while keeping distance from enemy head at (5, 8).  \n\nDOWN",

Next turn from (3, 1), possible moves: UP to (3, 2) safe, DOWN to (3, 0) safe, LEFT to (2, 1) safe, RIGHT to (4, 1) safe \u2192 all 4 safe moves next turn. Gets closer to apples (2, 6) etc.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 1):**  \n  No apple, length stays 3. Next turn from (5, 1), possible moves: UP to (5, 2) safe, DOWN to (5, 0) safe, LEFT to (4, 1) safe, RIGHT to (6, 1) safe \u2192 all 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Future apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to me now is (4, 6) at distance |4-4|=0, |1-6|=5 \u2192 5 steps.  \nFrom (3, 1): closest apple is (2, 6) distance 1+5=6.  \nFrom (5, 1): closest apple is (4, 6) distance 1+5=6.  \nFrom (4, 0): closest apple is (4, 6) distance 6.  \n\nSo all about equally far from apples, but LEFT or RIGHT gives more future mobility (4 safe moves next turn vs 3 for DOWN).  \n\n---\n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nCould enemy move to (3, 1) or (5, 1) or (4, 0)?  \nEnemy at (4, 8) \u2192 can\u2019t reach those in 1 move. No head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**  \nWe have 2 apples vs enemy\u2019s 0. Growing is good but not urgent. Keeping high mobility and moving toward apples (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 6) while staying clear of enemy\u2019s possible path is smart. Enemy will likely move toward (4, 6) or (3, 7). If we go LEFT, we might approach (2, 6) from below while enemy approaches (3, 7) or (4, 6) from above\u2014different paths, low risk of head-on soon.  \n\nLEFT gives 4 safe moves next turn and starts moving toward apples. RIGHT also gives 4 safe moves but moves toward board edge (x=9). LEFT seems slightly better for central positioning.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 1), aim to go UP/LEFT toward (2, 6) while watching enemy movement. Avoid trapping myself.  \n\nLEFT",
