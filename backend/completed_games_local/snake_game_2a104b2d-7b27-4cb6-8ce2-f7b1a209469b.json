          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after the last move.\n\nMy snake (ID 0) now has head at (1,5) and a body segment at (1,4). I just ate the apple at (1,5) last turn (as per the rationale), so now my apples collected should be 2 (but the score says \"apples: 1\" - this might be a lag in update? Actually, the game state shows \"Apples collected: 1\" for my snake, but I just moved to (1,5) which had an apple. This is confusing. Let me check the board: the apple at (1,5) is not listed in the apples? Wait, the apples are listed as (9,3), (7,6), (5,9), (0,0), (3,0). There is no (1,5) apple. But in the last rationale, it said \"apples are at ... (1,5)\"? That must have been a mistake last turn. Actually, looking back at the last turn: the board state last turn had an apple at (1,5)? But the apples listed were (9,3), (7,6), (5,9), (0,0), (1,5). Now the apples are (9,3), (7,6), (5,9), (0,0), (3,0). So the apple at (1,5) was eaten by me last move, and a new apple spawned at (3,0) (replacing it?).\n\nSo currently, my head is at (1,5), body at (1,4). I have collected 2 apples (since I started with 1 and ate one last turn), but the state says \"Apples collected: 1\" - this is probably not updated yet? Or perhaps the state is after the move but before the apple collection? Actually, the turn number is 3, and I have apples:1 in the score. So I had 1 apple before this move, and after moving to (1,5) which had an apple, I should have 2. But the state is displayed as after the move? The apples list now does not include (1,5), so it was eaten.\n\nSo for safety, I'll assume my body now has two segments: head at (1,5) and tail at (1,4). And I have 2 apples.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,5):\n- UP: (1,6) - empty, on board.\n- DOWN: (1,4) - my own body (tail) - dangerous! Moving backwards into my body would kill me.\n- LEFT: (0,5) - empty, on board.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - empty, on board.\n\nSo DOWN is not safe.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with no body. It might move in any direction. It is far from me (Manhattan distance 6: |7-1|+|3-5|=6+2=8? Actually, |1-7|=6, |5-3|=2, so 8 cells away). No immediate threat.\n\nApples available: (9,3), (7,6), (5,9), (0,0), (3,0). The closest to me are (3,0) and (0,0). (3,0) is at distance |1-3|+|5-0|=2+5=7, and (0,0) is |1-0|+|5-0|=1+5=6. So (0,0) is slightly closer.\n\nBut I should also consider avoiding future traps. Since I have a body now, I need to be careful not to box myself.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWhich one is best? Moving towards an apple: (0,0) is to the left and down. So moving LEFT (to (0,5)) gets me closer to (0,0) in x, but y is still high. Then I need to go down. Similarly, moving DOWN is not safe. So LEFT is good for heading towards (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, UP (to (1,6)) moves away from the apples, but might be safe for exploration? Not optimal.\n\nRIGHT (to (2,5)) moves slightly away from (0,0) but towards the center.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (3,0) which is to the right and down. So moving RIGHT might eventually lead to (3,0), but it's not direct.\n\nSo LEFT seems best to go towards (0,0).\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: it is at (7,3), might go for (7,6) or (9,3). Not a concern for me now.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, I should head down towards (0,0) or (3,0). But I need to avoid my own body. Next turn, from (0,5), I can go DOWN to (0,4), then (0,3), etc., to reach (0,0). This path seems clear. Alternatively, if I go RIGHT, I might go to (2,5), then down to (2,4), etc., to (3,0). But (0,0) is closer.\n\nSo LEFT is preferred.\n\nAlso, by moving LEFT, I have multiple options next turn: from (0,5), I can go UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), or RIGHT (1,5) but that is my current head? Actually, next turn, if I move LEFT to (0,5), then my body will be at (1,5) and (1,4). So from (0,5), I cannot go RIGHT to (1,5) because it will be my body. So only UP and DOWN are safe next turn? And LEFT is off board? (0,5) is at left edge, so LEFT is not possible. So from (0,5), safe moves would be UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), and RIGHT (1,5) but (1,5) is my body? Wait, after I move to (0,5), my body segments will be at (1,5) (previous head) and (1,4). So (1,5) is my body. So moving RIGHT to (1,5) would kill me. So only UP and DOWN are safe from (0,5).\n\nThat is acceptable: two moves. Then I can go down to (0,4), then (0,3), etc., to (0,0).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), then next turn from (2,5), I can go UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5) (body), RIGHT (3,5). So three options? But (1,5) is body, so not safe. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe. More options.\n\nSo RIGHT gives more flexibility next turn. And (3,0) is not much farther than (0,0). Actually, (0,0) is at distance 6, (3,0) is at distance 7. So similar.\n\nBut with RIGHT, I have more room to maneuver. Also, the enemy is on the right, but far.\n\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT are good. But RIGHT gives more future options.\n\nTo avoid getting trapped in the corner, RIGHT might be better.\n\nSo I'll choose RIGHT.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate safety considering enemy movement:**\n\nEnemy snake #1 at (7, 4) has possible moves:  \nUP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4).\n\nNo collision threat immediately \u2014 far away (Manhattan distance |2-7| + |5-4| = 6).\n\n---\n\n**3. Apples and future options:**\n\nClosest apples:  \n- (3,0) \u2014 distance |2-3| + |5-0| = 6  \n- (0,0) \u2014 distance |2-0| + |5-0| = 7  \n- (5,9) \u2014 distance 11 (far)  \n- (7,6) \u2014 distance 10 (far)  \n- (9,3) \u2014 distance 13 (far)\n\nSo nearest apples are (3,0) and (0,0).\n\n---\n\n**DOWN** goes toward (3,0) \u2014 reduce y first, then adjust x later.  \n**RIGHT** goes toward center and can later go down toward (3,0).  \n**UP** goes away from both closest apples.\n\nFrom (2,5):  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2,4): next moves will be DOWN again or sideways.  \nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3,5): good \u2014 opens more space, can go DOWN next.  \n\nCheck dead-end risks: My body at (1,5) means going LEFT is blocked now, but if I move RIGHT or DOWN I stay flexible.\n\n---\n\n**4. Which gives more options next turn?**\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5): next turn possible moves: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,4), RIGHT (4,5), LEFT (2,5) but (2,5) will be my body? Wait: next turn my body will be: head at (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5). So (2,5) is my neck \u2014 so moving LEFT into (2,5) is suicide. So 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4): next turn body: [(2,4), (2,5), (1,5)]. Safe moves next: UP (2,5) is body \u2014 no. DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4), RIGHT (3,4) \u2014 so 3 moves also.\n\nBoth seem equally flexible next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic preference:**  \nRIGHT moves toward board center, avoids getting trapped in left edge since body is blocking leftward path already. Moving DOWN also fine, but apple (3,0) is to the right and down, so combining RIGHT now and DOWN later might be efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n\nAfter RIGHT to (3,5), next move likely DOWN to (3,4), then toward (3,0). Keep an eye on enemy heading for (7,6) or (9,3). Stay central for optionality.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Wait, no: since we haven't eaten, we move and the tail moves. So body: head at (3,4), then (3,5). The old tail (2,5) is gone? Actually, in Snake, when you don't eat, you move forward and the tail follows. So after moving without eating, the snake length remains the same.\n\nSo if I move DOWN to (3,4), my body becomes: head at (3,4), then (3,5). The tail (2,5) is gone. So next turn, from (3,4), safe moves: UP (3,5) is body? No, that would be backwards? Actually, the body segment is at (3,5), so moving UP to (3,5) would hit my own body. So not safe. LEFT (2,4) empty, DOWN (3,3) empty, RIGHT (4,4) empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nSimilarly, RIGHT to (4,5): body becomes head at (4,5), then (3,5).

Safe for enemy: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples and distances:**\n- Closest apple: (3,0) at |3-3| + |4-0| = 4\n- (4,2): |3-4| + |4-2| = 1+2=3\n- (0,0): |3-0| + |4-0|=7\n- (5,9): |3-5|+|4-9|=2+5=7\n- (9,3): |3-9|+|4-3|=6+1=7\n\n(4,2) is very close (distance 3), and (3,0) is also close (distance 4). \n\n**Evaluate safe moves:**\n- DOWN (3,3): moves directly towards (3,0) and (4,2). From (3,3), distance to (3,0)=3, to (4,2)=|1|+|1|=2.\n- LEFT (2,4): moves away from both (3,0) and (4,2). Distance to (3,0)=|1|+|4|=5, to (4,2)=|2|+|2|=4.\n- RIGHT (4,4): moves towards (4,2) (distance becomes |0|+|2|=2) and (5,9). Distance to (3,0)=|1|+|4|=5.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are both good for apples. RIGHT is closer to (4,2) (2 vs 3 for DOWN), but DOWN is better for (3,0).\n\n**Future safety and options:**\nAfter moving:\n- If DOWN to (3,3): body becomes [(3,3), (3,4)] (tail moved). Next turn, from (3,3): safe moves? UP (3,4) is body, DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3). So 3 safe.\n- If RIGHT to (4,4): body becomes [(4,4), (3,4)]. Next turn, from (4,4): UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), RIGHT (5,4), LEFT (3,4) is body. So 3 safe.\n- If LEFT to (2,4): body becomes [(2,4), (3,4)]. Next turn, from (2,4): UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4), RIGHT (3,4) is body. So 3 safe.\n\nAll have similar future options.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nEnemy at (7,6): Manhattan distance to me is |3-7| + |4-6| = 4+2=6. No immediate danger. It might go for (5,9) or (9,3).\n\n**Plan:**\nGo for the closest apple (4,2). RIGHT moves directly towards it (to (4,4), then next turn DOWN to (4,3) and then to (4,2). Alternatively, DOWN to (3,3) then RIGHT to (4,3) and DOWN to (4,2) is same steps. But RIGHT is more direct.\n\nAlso, (4,2) is uncontested? Enemy is far.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is best for (4,2). Also, it opens more central positions.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nFrom (4,4), aim to go DOWN to (4,3) to approach (4,2). Avoid going LEFT (backwards) unless necessary.\n\nRIGHT",

Tail is at (4,4). Length = 2 (1 apple collected).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1): head at (7,8), body: [(7,7)] (since it moved UP from (7,7) to (7,8)? Actually, last turn enemy head was at (7,8) with body at (7,7) as given. So it moved UP? But let's note: enemy head at (7,8) now.\n- Apples: (9,3), (5,9), (0,0), (3,0), (4,2).\n\n**My current head: (4,3)**\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (4,4) \u2192 my own body (tail) \u2192 unsafe (would die).\n- DOWN: (4,2) \u2192 empty (and has an apple!).\n- LEFT: (3,3) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: (5,3) \u2192 empty.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Immediate apple targeting:**\nApple at (4,2) is directly below me. Moving DOWN will eat it.\nThis is the closest apple (Manhattan distance 1).\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,8) with body at (7,7). It is far away (Manhattan |7-4|+|8-3|=3+5=8). No immediate collision risk.\n\nEnemy's possible moves from (7,8):\n- UP: (7,9) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN: (7,7) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT: (6,8) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: (8,8) \u2192 empty.\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy might go for apple at (5,9) (distance |7-5|+|8-9|=2+1=3) or (9,3) (|7-9|+|8-3|=2+5=7). So likely enemy will move towards (5,9) via UP/LEFT? Not directly towards me.\n\n**After eating the apple:**\nIf I move DOWN to (4,2) and eat the apple, I will grow by 1. So my body becomes: head at (4,2), body segments: [(4,3), (4,4)] (the tail remains at (4,4) until the growth pushes it). Actually, when eating, the tail doesn't move this turn, so next turn my body will be: head at (4,2), then (4,3), then (4,4). So length 3.\n\nThen next turn, I'll have to avoid moving back into (4,3) (which is my body).\n\n**Alternatives:**\nIf I don't go for the apple (DOWN), I can go LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3). But that would delay eating the apple. However, the apple at (4,2) is very close and uncontested. Eating it gives me an advantage (score becomes 2, while enemy is at 1).\n\nGoing LEFT or RIGHT doesn't give any immediate benefit. So DOWN is best.\n\n**Future safety after DOWN:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (4,2) and eating apple:\n- My body: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\nNext turn (turn 9), head at (4,2). Possible moves:\n- UP: (4,3) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,1) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT: (3,2) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: (5,2) \u2192 empty.\nSo 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating apple at (4,2), consider moving towards other apples. The apple at (3,0) is close (distance |4-3|+|2-0|=1+2=3). Also (0,0) and (9,3) are far. Enemy might go for (5,9) or (9,3). So I can plan to go down/left towards (3,0) and (0,0).\n\nBut for now, prioritize eating the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove DOWN to eat the apple at (4,2). This is safe, increases my score, and maintains good future mobility.\n\nDOWN",

Distance to me: |8-4|+|8-2|=4+6=10. No immediate threat.\nEnemy's possible moves from (8,8):\n- UP: (8,9) \u2192 apple (8,9) is there \u2192 safe (will eat apple and grow).\n- DOWN: (8,7) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT: (7,8) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,8) \u2192 empty (but off board? x=9 is valid, y=8 is valid \u2192 safe).\nSo enemy has safe moves: UP (to eat apple), DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy will likely move UP to eat the apple at (8,9). After eating, its body will become [(8,8), (7,8)] (length 3) and score becomes 2.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nClosest apples to me:\n- (3,0): Manhattan distance |4-3|+|2-0|=1+2=3.\n- (0,0): |4-0|+|2-0|=4+2=6.\n- (9,3): |4-9|+|2-3|=5+1=6.\n- (5,9): |4-5|+|2-9|=1+7=8.\n\nSo (3,0) is the closest. Moving LEFT and DOWN would get me closer.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nFrom (4,2), if I move:\n- DOWN to (4,1): then next turn, I can go DOWN to (4,0), LEFT to (3,1), RIGHT to (5,1). All safe? (4,0) is empty, (3,1) empty, (5,1) empty. Good.\n- LEFT to (3,2): next turn, can go UP (3,3) empty, DOWN (3,1) empty, LEFT (2,2) empty. Good.\n- RIGHT to (5,2): next turn, UP (5,3) empty, DOWN (5,1) empty, RIGHT (6,2) empty. Good.\n\nAll safe moves offer good future mobility.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\nI should head towards the apple at (3,0). Moving LEFT (to (3,2)) gets me closer in x-direction, and then I can go DOWN twice to (3,0). Alternatively, moving DOWN (to (4,1)) also gets me closer, and then LEFT and DOWN to (3,0).\n\nSince both LEFT and DOWN are good, but LEFT directly reduces the x-distance to (3,0) (from 4 to 3), while DOWN only reduces y-distance (from 2 to 1). So LEFT is slightly more direct.\n\nAlso, note that enemy is far and busy with its own apple. No immediate danger.\n\n**Choice:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe and lead towards apples. However, LEFT (to (3,2)) is more efficient for reaching (3,0) because it aligns me with the same x-coordinate (3). From (3,2), I can go DOWN to (3,1) and then DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,1) would require an additional LEFT move to (3,1) and then DOWN to (3,0), which is one extra step? Actually same number of moves: \n- Path via LEFT: (4,2) -> LEFT (3,2) -> DOWN (3,1) -> DOWN (3,0) [3 moves to apple].\n- Path via DOWN: (4,2) -> DOWN (4,1) -> LEFT (3,1) -> DOWN (3,0) [also 3 moves].\n\nBut the path via LEFT has the advantage that after (3,2), I am closer to other apples like (0,0) if needed.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT might be slightly safer in terms of avoiding potential future conflicts with enemy? Not really, but it's fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI choose LEFT to move towards the apple at (3,0) efficiently.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy will move away from me.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is at (3,0), directly below me. Moving DOWN eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (0,0) distance 4, (2,8) distance 8, (5,9) distance 10, (9,3) distance 10.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- DOWN to (3,0): eat apple \u2192 grow to length 4. Next turn, my body will be [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)]? Wait, after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move, so body becomes [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]? Let\u2019s track: current body: head moves to (3,0) and apple eaten \u2192 new segment added at tail, so body: [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]. Next turn from (3,0): UP to (3,1) is my body \u2192 unsafe; LEFT (2,0) empty; RIGHT (4,0) empty; DOWN off board \u2192 deadly. So only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn. That\u2019s a bit risky\u2014only two exits.  \n- LEFT to (2,1): next turn, from (2,1): UP (2,2) empty, DOWN (2,0) empty, LEFT (1,1) empty, RIGHT (3,1) my body? Next turn my body will be [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] after moving left (tail moves to (3,2)? Let\u2019s check: current body: [(3,2), (4,2)]. Head moves to (2,1), tail moves forward one, so new body: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? Actually, the segment after head was (3,2) now becomes (3,1) because head was at (3,1) and moves to (2,1), so the first body segment goes to old head position (3,1), and the tail (4,2) moves to (3,2). So body: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]. Then from (2,1) next turn: UP (2,2) empty, DOWN (2,0) empty, LEFT (1,1) empty, RIGHT (3,1) my body \u2192 unsafe. So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 three options. Better mobility.  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): next turn, body: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? Head moves to (4,1), so body: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]. From (4,1): UP (4,2) my body \u2192 unsafe; DOWN (4,0) empty; LEFT (3,1) my body \u2192 unsafe; RIGHT (5,1) empty. So only DOWN and RIGHT safe \u2192 two options, similar to DOWN but without eating apple.\n\n**Strategic trade-off:**  \n- DOWN: immediate apple, but next turn only two safe moves (LEFT/RIGHT from (3,0)) \u2014 could lead to trapping if not careful.  \n- LEFT: no apple now, but better mobility next turn (three safe moves), and positions me to go toward (0,0) or (2,8) later.  \n- RIGHT: no apple, only two safe moves next turn, less ideal.\n\nGiven the enemy is far and not threatening, I can afford to prioritize safety and mobility over immediate apple capture. Eating the apple at (3,0) now would reduce my next-turn options significantly, which is risky long-term. Better to approach it with more flexibility\u2014maybe from the side next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter LEFT to (2,1), next turn I can go DOWN to (2,0) to eat the apple at (3,0)? Wait, (2,0) is adjacent to (3,0)? From (2,1), DOWN to (2,0) is empty, then I\u2019m next to (3,0)\u2014I could eat it the following turn from (2,0) by moving RIGHT to (3,0), which would give me more options before committing. This path keeps mobility high.\n\n**Choice:**  \nLEFT avoids the mobility trap of eating (3,0) immediately and sets up a safer approach to the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Distance to me: |9-2| + |8-1| = 7+7=14. No immediate threat. Enemy's safe moves from (9,8):\n- UP: (9,9) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (9,7) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT: (8,8) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 deadly.\nSo enemy has two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. Enemy is far and not threatening.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (3,0) is at distance 2 (Manhattan), (0,0) at distance 3, (2,8) at distance 7, (5,9) at distance 11, (9,3) at distance 12.\nMoving DOWN to (2,0) gets me adjacent to both (3,0) and (0,0). Moving LEFT to (1,1) also keeps me close to these.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- UP to (2,2): Next turn, body becomes [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]? Actually, after moving, head to (2,2), then body segments shift: first to old head (2,1), second to old first body (3,1), tail (3,2) is gone? Wait, no growth, so tail moves: new body = [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)] (since tail was (3,2) and we moved, so it shortens? Actually, in Snake, when you don't eat an apple, you move forward and the tail moves one step, so the body length remains the same. So from (2,1) with body [(3,1), (3,2)], moving UP to (2,2): new head at (2,2), then the first body segment becomes the old head (2,1), and the second becomes the old first body (3,1) (the tail (3,2) is left behind). So new body: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]. Then from (2,2) next turn: UP (2,3) empty, DOWN (2,1) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (1,2) empty, RIGHT (3,2) empty. So three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 good mobility.\n- DOWN to (2,0): New body: [(2,0), (2,1), (3,1)]. Next turn from (2,0): UP (2,1) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN off board \u2192 deadly, LEFT (1,0) empty, RIGHT (3,0) apple (safe to eat). So only two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. However, RIGHT leads to eating apple (3,0) next turn.\n- LEFT to (1,) empty, DOWN (1,0) empty, LEFT (0,1) empty, RIGHT (2,1) my body \u2192 unsafe. So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) \u2014 good mobility.\n\n**Strategic trade-off:**\n- DOWN: Leads to a position (2,0) with only two exits next turn, but one exit (RIGHT) directly eats the apple at (3,0). This is a committed path: eating the apple next turn would grow me to length 4, but then from (3,0) I'd have only two exits (LEFT and RIGHT) as analyzed last turn \u2014 still restrictive.\n- LEFT: Maintains high mobility (three exits) and positions me to approach (0,0) or (3,0) more flexibly.\n- UP: Also good mobility, but moves away from the closest apples.\n\nGiven the enemy is no threat, I should prioritize long-term mobility and safety. Eating the apple at (3,0) is tempting, but doing so now (via DOWN) would reduce my options next turn. Better to approach it from a direction that preserves more exits.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove LEFT to (1,1) to maintain mobility. Next turn, from (1,1), I can go DOWN to (1,0) to get adjacent to both (0,0) and (3,0), or LEFT to (0,1) to approach (0,0). This keeps options open for eating either apple safely without trapping myself.\n\n**Choice:**\nLEFT is the safest move with the best future flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Current State Analysis (Turn 14):**\n\n- My snake (ID 0): head at (1,2), body: [(1,1), (2,1)] (length 3, apples collected: 2).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1): head at (9,6), body: [(9,7), (9,8)] (length 3, apples collected: 2).\n- Apples: (9,3), (5,9), (0,0), (3,0), (2,8).\n\n**My head position: (1,2)**  \nPossible moves:\n- UP: (1,3) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN: (1,1) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,2) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) \u2192 empty.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy snake #1 is at (9,6). Distance to me: |9-1| + |6-2| = 8+4=12. No immediate threat. Enemy's safe moves from (9,6):\n- UP: (9,7) \u2192 its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (9,5) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT: (8,6) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 deadly.\nSo enemy has two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. Enemy is far and not threatening.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (0,0) at distance 3 (Manhattan), (3,0) at distance 3, (2,8) at distance 6, (5,9) at distance 11, (9,3) at distance 13.\nMoving LEFT to (0,2) gets me closer to (0,0) (distance reduces to 2). Moving RIGHT to (2,2) gets me closer to (3,0) (distance reduces to 2) and (2,8) (distance reduces to 6). Moving UP to (1,3) moves away from these closest apples.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- UP to (1,3): New body: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]. Next turn from (1,3): UP (1,4) empty, DOWN (1,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (0,3) empty, RIGHT (2,3) empty. So three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 good mobility.\n- LEFT to (0,2): New body: [(0,2), (1,2), (1,1)]. Next turn from (0,2): UP (0,3) empty, DOWN (0,1) empty, LEFT off board \u2192 deadly, RIGHT (1,2) my body \u2192 unsafe. So two safe moves: UP and DOWN. This position is restrictive but allows approaching (0,0) from above next turn (via DOWN to (0,1) then LEFT to (0,0) to eat).\n- RIGHT to (2,2): New body: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,1)]. Next turn from (2,2): UP (2,3) empty, DOWN (2,1) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (1,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (3,2) empty. So two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. This position is restrictive but allows approaching (3,0) via DOWN later or (2,8) via UP.\n\n**Strategic trade-off:**\nUP maintains high mobility (three exits) and avoids committing to a corner or edge. LEFT and RIGHT lead to positions with only two exits next turn, which is risky long-term.\nThe enemy is no threat, so I should prioritize maintaining flexibility. Eating apples like (0,0) or (3,0) can be done later with better positioning to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove UP to (1,3) to preserve mobility. From there, I can assess which apple to target (e.g., (2,8) via further UP and RIGHT, or (0,0) via LEFT and DOWN). This keeps options open and avoids restrictive positions.\n\n**Choice:**\nUP is the safest move with the best future flexibility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,2) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,3) \u2192 empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) \u2192 empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy #1 is at (9,5), a Manhattan distance of |9-1| + |5-3| = 8+2=10. Not an immediate danger. Their safe moves from (9,5) are likely UP (9,6) their body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) empty, RIGHT off-board \u2192 unsafe. So they have DOWN and LEFT. They are moving away from my position on the far right side. No threat of collision or head-on conflict this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity and Pathing:**\n- (0,0): distance 4. Moving LEFT to (0,3) gets me closer (distance to apple becomes 3).\n- (3,0): distance 3. Moving RIGHT to (2,3) gets me slightly closer (distance becomes 2).\n- (2,8): distance 5. Moving UP to (1,4) gets me closer (distance becomes 4).\n- Other apples are significantly farther away.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT move me towards the two closest apples. UP moves me towards the third closest apple (2,8).\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n- **UP to (1,4)**: New head position. Next turn possible moves: UP (1,5) empty, DOWN (1,3) my body (unsafe), LEFT (0,4) empty, RIGHT (2,4) empty. This gives 3 safe moves. Good flexibility.\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: On the left edge. Next turn: UP (0,4) empty, DOWN (0,2) empty, LEFT off-board (deadly), RIGHT (1,3) my body (unsafe). Only 2 safe moves. This is restrictive and places me on the edge.\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: Next turn: UP (2,4) empty, DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) my body (unsafe), RIGHT (3,3) empty. Also only 2 safe moves. This is also slightly restrictive.\n\nUP again offers the best future mobility, keeping me away from the board edges and maintaining options.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nSince the enemy is not an immediate threat, prioritizing mobility and safety is key. Moving UP continues the strategy from the last turn, keeping me in open space with more options for future turns. I can reassess the path to (2,8), (0,0), or (3,0) from a position of strength with high mobility. Moving to an edge now (LEFT or RIGHT) reduces my options and increases risk in subsequent turns.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue using the center/open areas for high mobility. Evaluate a path to the nearest safe apple, favoring the one that doesn't force me into a corner. Keep monitoring enemy #1's movement pattern; they are currently confined to the right side but could become a threat if they start moving left.\n\nUP",

RIGHT: Would move to (10, 5) - This is off the board (x=10 is beyond the 0-9 range) - DEAD\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nLet me evaluate the safe moves:\n- DOWN: Moving to (9, 4) - This keeps me in the same column as the apple at (9, 3), moving me closer to it\n- LEFT: Moving to (8, 5) - This moves me away from the nearest apple, but keeps more options open\n\nLooking at the apple positions and my current position:\n- There's an apple at (9, 3) which is in the same column as my head\n- Moving DOWN would bring me closer to that apple\n- Moving LEFT moves me away from the nearest apple but keeps more board options\n\nI also need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (1, 3) and likely targeting the apple at (0, 0). It's not an immediate threat.\n\nThe DOWN move is safe and moves me toward the apple at (9, 3). This seems like the better strategic choice as it pursues a nearby food source while maintaining safety.\n\nDOWN",

The only cell we could both move into is (8,4) if I go RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT... that's 7 moves away. No immediate threat of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (2, 8): Manhattan distance = |1-2| + |4-8| = 1+4=5. Moving UP gets me closer (distance becomes 4). Moving LEFT/RIGHT keeps distance at 5.\n- (0, 0): Distance = |1-0| + |4-0| = 1+4=5.

Far.\n- (9, 3): Distance = 11. Far.\n\nUP is best for closest apple (2,8). LEFT is best for (0,0). RIGHT is best for (3,0).\n\n**Future Mobility (Safe moves from new head position):**\n- **UP to (1, 5):**\n    - Next moves: UP(1,6) empty, DOWN(1,4) my body (unsafe), LEFT(0,5) empty, RIGHT(2,5) empty. **3 safe options.** Excellent mobility.\n- **LEFT to (0, 4):**\n    - Next moves: UP(0,5) empty, DOWN(0,3) empty, LEFT off-board (unsafe), RIGHT(1,4) my body (unsafe). **2 safe options.** Restricted on the edge.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    - Next moves: UP(2,5) empty, DOWN(2,3) empty, LEFT(1,4) my body (unsafe), RIGHT(3,4) empty. **3 safe options.** Good mobility.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nUP and RIGHT offer the best future mobility (3 options). UP directly advances me towards the closest apple (2,8). The enemy is moving DOWN/LEFT, staying on the right side of the board, so moving UP continues to keep a safe distance. Moving RIGHT would bring me slightly closer to the enemy's potential path without immediate danger, but UP seems safer for maintaining a central-ish position with a clear objective.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving towards the apple cluster in the top-left quadrant ((2,8), (0,0)). Monitor enemy #1; they are likely to consume the apple at (9,3) and may start moving leftward. Prioritize paths that keep multiple escape routes open.\n\nUP",

Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)].\n- Enemy is 4 cells away (Manhattan distance |4-7| + |8-7| = 3+1=4).\n- Snake #1 can move UP(7,8), DOWN(7,6), LEFT(6,7), RIGHT(8,7). It can pose a threat in 2-3 turns if it moves towards us. We must monitor its direction. No immediate collision threat this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (5,9): Distance 2 (Manhattan: |4-5| + |8-9| = 1+1=2). Very close.\n- (7,7): Distance 4 (Manhattan: |4-7| + |8-7| = 3+1=4). Enemy is on this apple? Actually, the apple is at (7,7) and enemy head is at (7,7) \u2014 this means snake #1 will eat that apple this turn and grow to 5 apples. So (7,7) is no longer available.\n- (3,2): Distance 6.\n- (0,0): Far.\n- (3,0): Far.\n- (1,5): Distance 4 (Manhattan: |4-1| + |8-5| = 3+3=6? Wait recalc: |4-1|=3, |8-5|=3, so 6). Actually not as close.\nSo the most reachable apple is (5,9).\n\n**Future Mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (4,9):**\n    - Next head: (4,9). Body becomes [(4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8)].\n    - Next moves from (4,9): DOWN (4,8) is body (unsafe), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9). **2 safe moves.**\n    - Gets very close to apple (5,9) \u2014 can eat it next turn with RIGHT. But top edge has limited escape.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,7):**\n    - Next head: (4,7). Body becomes [(4,7), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8)].\n    - Next moves from (4,7): UP (4,8) is body (unsafe), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7). **3 safe moves.**\n    - Moves away from the nearest apple. Opens central options but delays apple collection.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,8):**\n    - Next head: (5,8). Body becomes [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8)].\n    - Next moves from (5,8): UP (5,9) [apple!], DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8) is body (unsafe), RIGHT (6,8). **3 safe moves.**\n    - Puts apple (5,9) directly above us \u2014 can eat it next turn with UP. Also maintains good central mobility.\n\n**Strategic Choice and Long-term Plan:**\nRIGHT is the best move. It positions us to easily eat the apple at (5,9) on the next turn (by moving UP) while maintaining 3 future moves. This is superior to UP which has only 2 moves next turn and risks getting pinned on the top edge. DOWN avoids the apple and is less efficient. Snake #1 will eat the (7,7) apple and grow, so we need to catch up. Our plan: Move RIGHT now, then UP to (5,9) to eat the apple next turn. This will make us 4 apples vs enemy 5. Then we can consider moving towards the central apples (3,2) or (1,5) while avoiding the now-larger enemy. Keep an eye on snake #1's movement \u2014 it might move towards the center after eating.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating it will grow us to 4 segments. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN (5,7):** Empty. **Safe.**\n- **LEFT (4,8):** My body (segment directly behind head). **Unsafe.**\n- **RIGHT (6,8):** Empty. **Safe.**\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Threat (Snake #1):**\n- Head: (7, 8).

This is close.\n- Snake #1 can move UP(7,9), DOWN(7,7) (its own body), LEFT(6,8), RIGHT(8,8).\n- LEFT (6,8) is particularly dangerous: if snake #1 moves LEFT and we move RIGHT, we collide head-on at (6,8) and both die. This is a critical threat.\n- Snake #1 might also move UP to (7,9) or RIGHT to (8,8), which are both safe for it.\n- We must avoid a potential head-on collision.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (5,9): Directly above us.

But we gain an apple and become size 4 (vs enemy size 5).\n    - No immediate risk of head-on collision with enemy if we go UP.\n\n- **DOWN to (5,7):**\n    - Next head: (5,7). Body: [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)].\n    - Next moves: UP (5,8) is body (unsafe), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). **3 safe moves.**\n    - Moves away from the enemy and the apple. Central position with good options.\n    - Avoids any collision risk.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,8):**\n    - Next head: (6,8). Body: [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)].\n    - Next moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8) is body (unsafe), RIGHT (7,8). **3 safe moves.**\n    - But RIGHT is extremely dangerous: if snake #1 moves LEFT to (6,8) (which is a valid move for it), we collide head-on and both die. This risk is too high to take.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n- RIGHT is too risky due to potential head-on collision with snake #1.\n- UP allows us to eat the apple and grow, but leaves us with only 2 moves next turn (at top edge). However, it avoids the collision risk.\n- DOWN is safe, avoids the enemy, and gives 3 moves next turn, but we miss the nearby apple.\n\nGiven the high risk of RIGHT, we must avoid it. Between UP and DOWN:\n- UP is aggressive: we get the apple and catch up to 4 apples (enemy has 5), but we might get trapped on the top edge.\n- DOWN is conservative: we maintain good mobility and safety, but delay eating.\n\nGiven the close proximity of the enemy and the need to catch up in apples, UP is preferable. We can plan to escape the top edge next turn by moving LEFT or RIGHT from (5,9).\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving UP to (5,9) and eating the apple, we become size 4. Next turn, from (5,9), we cannot go DOWN (into body). So we can go LEFT to (4,9) or RIGHT to (6,9). We should choose the direction that gives more future options and avoids the enemy. Snake #1 might be near (7,9) or (6,8) by then. We should monitor its move and choose the safer direction.\n\nUP",

UP: Would move to (7, 10) - This is off the board! - DEAD (hitting wall)\n2. DOWN: Would move to (7, 8) - This is where my own body segment is! - DEAD (hitting own body)\n3. LEFT: Would move to (6, 9) - This is safe, no snake parts or walls there\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (8, 9) - This is safe, no snake parts or walls there\n\nSo UP and DOWN are eliminated as they're suicide moves.\n\nEvaluating the remaining safe moves:\n- LEFT: Moving to (6, 9) moves me away from the top edge, keeps me in a good position\n- RIGHT: Moving to (8, 9) moves me toward the right edge\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5, 9), right next to me. If I move LEFT to (6, 9), I maintain my position well. If I move RIGHT to (8, 9), I move away from the enemy but also away from most apples.\n\nLooking at board positioning:\n- The closest apples are (2, 3) and (1, 5) in the lower left quadrant\n- There are also apples at (3, 0) and (3, 2) in the lower middle\n- Apple at (0, 0) is in the bottom left corner\n\nSince my snake and the enemy snake both have 4 apples and we're both positioned at the top of the board, moving LEFT to (6, 9) seems like the safer bet. This keeps me away from the edge and maintains good positioning. Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) could potentially trap me against the right wall.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that the enemy snake might move LEFT to (4, 9), which would be toward the center and toward apples.\n\nActually, the enemy snake is at (5, 9), so if it moves LEFT, it goes to (4, 9). If I move LEFT to (6, 9), we would be two spaces apart horizontally at the top.\n\nLEFT keeps me in a better central position compared to RIGHT which moves me toward the edge.\n\nStrategy note: Move LEFT to (6, 9) to maintain central positioning at the top while avoiding the edge and potential early confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n- Enemy is 2 cells away (Manhattan distance |5-7| + |9-9| = 2+0=2). This is very close.\n- Snake #1 can move UP(7,10) (off board, unsafe), DOWN(7,8) (its own body, unsafe), LEFT(6,9), RIGHT(8,9).\n- So its only safe moves are LEFT (to (6,9)) and RIGHT (to (8,9)).\n- If snake #1 moves LEFT to (6,9), and we move RIGHT to (6,9), we will have a head-on collision and both die. This is a critical threat.\n- If snake #1 moves RIGHT to (8,9), it is safe for it, and we can safely move RIGHT to (6,9) without collision.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (3,2): Distance 7 (Manhattan: |5-3| + |9-2| = 2+7=9? Wait recalc: |5-3|=2, |9-2|=7, so 9).\n- (1,5): Distance 8 (|5-1|=4, |9-5|=4, so 8).\n- (3,0): Distance 11.\n- (0,0): Far.\nNone are very close. The closest is (1,5) and (3,2) but both are 8+ Manhattan away.\n\n**Future Mobility after each safe move (considering enemy threat):**\n- **LEFT to (4,9):**\n    - Next head: (4,9). Body: [(4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)].\n    - Next moves: DOWN (4,8) is body (unsafe), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9) is body (unsafe). So only **1 safe move: LEFT to (3,9)**.\n    - This is very restrictive. From (3,9) we could then go DOWN to (3,8) (body) or LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9) (body). So we would be trapped in a cycle with limited options.\n    - However, if we move LEFT, we avoid the collision risk with snake #1 entirely.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,9):**\n    - Next head: (6,9). Body: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)].\n    - Next moves: DOWN (6,8), LEFT (5,9) is body (unsafe), RIGHT (7,9) (enemy head? But enemy might move away). So **2 safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT**.\n    - However, there is a 50% chance that snake #1 moves LEFT to (6,9), causing a head-on collision and killing us both.\n    - If snake #1 moves RIGHT to (8,9), then we are safe at (6,9) and have 2 moves next turn.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nRIGHT is risky because it has a 50% chance of death (if enemy moves LEFT). LEFT is safe from collision but leaves us with only 1 move next turn, leading to potential trapping.\n\nHowever, note that snake #1 has two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. It is not forced to move LEFT. It might choose RIGHT to avoid us or to pursue its own goals. But we cannot predict its move with certainty.\n\nGiven that we are at 4 apples (same as enemy) and the game is long, we should prioritize survival. Therefore, we should choose LEFT to (4,9) to avoid the collision risk entirely, even though it gives poor mobility next turn. We can hope that next turn we can move LEFT to (3,9) and then plan from there.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider that snake #1 might not choose LEFT. But the risk is too high: if it does, we die.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,9), we will have only one safe move: LEFT to (3,9). Then from (3,9), we can only go LEFT to (2,9) (since DOWN to (3,8) is body and RIGHT to (4,9) is body). So we will be moving left along the top edge. We should hope that the enemy does not block us. We might eventually find a way to go down from (2,9) to (2,8) (but that is our body) or (2,7) if we wait. Alternatively, we might find an apple to break the cycle.\n\nBut survival is key. We avoid the immediate risk.\n\nLEFT",

So if enemy moves LEFT to (5,9), it would hit our body and die. Therefore, enemy will not move LEFT to (5,9) because it is unsafe for them.\n- Enemy safe moves: DOWN (6,8) and RIGHT (7,9) (but (7,9) is their own body? Actually, their body is at (7,9) currently? Wait: their body is [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7)]. So (7,9) is their own body.

Wait: our body list after move: [ (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8) ]. So (3,8) is not in our body. However, note that in the previous turn we had (3,8) as body, but after moving we lose the tail? Actually, we did not eat an apple, so we do not grow. Therefore, the tail (3,8) is removed. So our new body is [(4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8)].\n    - So DOWN to (3,8) is safe? But wait: is (3,8) free?

No immediate collision threat exists.\n\n**Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n- Apples at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), (1,5), (2,3).\n- My goal is to descend safely to target the apples at (3,2) and (2,3).\n- From (3,9), moving DOWN to (3,8) brings me directly closer to these apples and keeps me centered.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9) also brings me closer to the apple at (2,3), but leaves me on the top edge with fewer downward options next turn.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n- **If I move DOWN to (3,8):**\n    - Next head: (3,8). Body: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(3,9) (own body), DOWN(3,7) (empty), LEFT(2,8) (empty), RIGHT(4,8) (own body). So I would have DOWN and LEFT available. Excellent mobility to continue descent.\n- **If I move LEFT to (2,9):**\n    - Next head: (2,9). Body: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(2,10) (off board), DOWN(2,8) (empty), LEFT(1,9) (empty), RIGHT(3,9) (own body). So I would have DOWN and LEFT available. Worse because UP is blocked by the board edge, reducing options.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the superior choice. It maximizes descent towards the apples and maintains better future mobility by keeping me away from the top edge.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:** Continue descending towards the apples at (3,2) and (2,3). Prefer moves that keep me centered and avoid the top row. Monitor enemy #1's position.\n\nDOWN",

So enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n- Enemy is currently at (6,7) and might move in any direction. Most importantly, it could move LEFT to (5,7) or DOWN to (6,6), which are not an immediate threat to our head at (3,8). No direct collision threat exists this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- Apples at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), (1,5), (2,3).\n- My goal is to descend towards the apples at (3,2) and (2,3). From (3,8), moving DOWN (to (3,7)) is the most direct path to these apples.\n- Moving LEFT (to (2,8)) also brings me closer to (2,3), but is slightly less direct.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n- **If I move DOWN to (3,7):**\n    - Next head: (3,7). Body: [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(3,8) (own body), DOWN(3,6) (empty), LEFT(2,7) (empty), RIGHT(4,7) (empty). So I would have DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT available.

Also good, but moving right is blocked by my own body.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both moves are safe and have good future options. However, DOWN is more aligned with my descent strategy to reach the apples at (3,2) and (2,3). It also keeps me centered and avoids the left edge, which might be beneficial for future flexibility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:** Continue descending towards the apples at (3,2) and (2,3). Prefer DOWN if safe, then LEFT. Monitor enemy #1's movement; it is currently at (6,7) and may be heading towards the apple at (1,5) or (2,3), so be cautious of potential conflicts.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN to (3,5) is the most direct step towards both.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,6) is also a good step towards (2,3), but it's slightly less direct than going down.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,6) moves me away from the target cluster and offers no immediate apple benefit.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n- **If I move DOWN to (3,5):**\n    - Next head: (3,5). Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(3,6) (own body), DOWN(3,4) (empty), LEFT(2,5) (empty), RIGHT(4,5) (empty). So I would have DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT available. This maintains excellent mobility and gets me closer to the apples.\n- **If I move LEFT to (2,6):**\n    - Next head: (2,6). Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(2,7) (empty), DOWN(2,5) (empty), LEFT(1,6) (empty), RIGHT(3,6) (own body). So I would have UP, DOWN, and LEFT available. Good mobility, but I've moved laterally instead of descending.\n- **If I move RIGHT to (4,6):**\n    - Next head: (4,6). Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(4,7) (empty), DOWN(4,5) (empty), LEFT(3,6) (own body), RIGHT(5,6) (empty). So I would have UP, DOWN, and RIGHT available. This is a safe but less optimal move away from the targets.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the strongest move. It directly progresses towards the apple cluster at (3,2)/(2,3) while keeping all future options open (except the backward move UP, which is expected). LEFT is an acceptable alternative, but RIGHT is sub-optimal as it moves me away from the goal.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:** Continue the descent towards the apples at (3,2) and (2,3). From (3,5), prefer DOWN again to reach (3,4), then (3,3), etc. Be aware that snake #1 is also hunting for the (1,5) and (2,3) apples and might approach from the right side.\n\nDOWN",

However, there is a high risk of collision with enemy if it moves LEFT to (4,4). Even if it doesn't, moving RIGHT offers no apple benefit.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n- RIGHT is dangerous due to potential head-on collision with enemy. Avoid.\n- DOWN and LEFT are both safe and progress towards apples.\n- DOWN is slightly better because it gets me to (3,3), from which I can directly go to (3,2) (apple) or (2,3) (apple) next turn.

Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\n- Enemy possible moves from (4,4):\n  - UP (4,5): empty.\n  - DOWN (4,3): empty (this is my RIGHT option).\n  - LEFT (3,4): my body (but note: it is my body, not empty. So unsafe for enemy).\n  - RIGHT (5,4): own body (unsafe).\nSo enemy has only two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (4,3), it would be moving into the same cell I am considering for RIGHT. A head-on collision would occur if I move RIGHT to (4,3) and enemy moves DOWN to (4,3). This would kill both of us.\n- If enemy moves UP to (4,5), it moves away from me.\n\n**Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n- Apples at: (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), (1,5), (2,3).\n- From my head (3,3):\n  - DOWN to (3,2): lands directly on an apple.\n  - LEFT to (2,3): lands directly on an apple.\n  - RIGHT to (4,3): no apple, moves away from the cluster of apples.\n- Therefore, DOWN and LEFT are both highly lucrative, instantly granting an apple and growth.\n\n**Future Mobility (after eating an apple):**\n- If I move DOWN to (3,2) (apple):\n    - My new head: (3,2). New body: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)] (length 6).\n    - Next safe moves: UP(3,3) (own body), DOWN(3,1) (empty), LEFT(2,2) (empty), RIGHT(4,2) (empty). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT available. Good mobility.\n- If I move LEFT to (2,3) (apple):\n    - My new head: (2,3). New body: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)] (length 6).\n    - Next safe moves: UP(2,4) (empty), DOWN(2,2) (empty), LEFT(1,3) (empty), RIGHT(3,3) (own body). So UP, DOWN, LEFT available. Good mobility.\n- If I move RIGHT to (4,3):\n    - No apple. Body: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] (tail at (3,7) is dropped, so length remains 5).\n    - Next head: (4,3). Body: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)].\n    - Next safe moves: UP(4,4) (enemy head? but enemy might move), DOWN(4,2) (empty), LEFT(3,3) (own body), RIGHT(5,3) (empty). However, UP is risky because enemy is at (4,4) and might stay or move. So only DOWN and RIGHT are clearly safe. Worse mobility and no apple.\n\n**Risk of Head-on Collision:**\n- RIGHT (4,3) is highly dangerous because the enemy has a safe move to (4,3) (DOWN). If both of us choose these moves, we die. Even if the enemy chooses UP (50% chance), I still get no apple and worse position. Avoid RIGHT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- RIGHT is risky and non-beneficial. Eliminate.\n- DOWN and LEFT both give an apple and are safe.\n- Which one to choose?\n  - DOWN (3,2): gets me the apple at (3,2). From there, I can go to (3,1) or (3,0) (another apple) or move leftwards.\n  - LEFT (2,3): gets me the apple at (2,3). From there, I can go to (1,3) or (2,4) or (2,2).\n- Both are excellent. Since the enemy is not threatening either of these moves (enemy can only go UP or DOWN from (4,4)), I am free to choose.\n- I should consider the enemy's potential actions: if it moves DOWN to (4,3), it will be closer to my position if I am at (3,2) or (2,3). But since I will have grown, my body will be longer and might block it.\n- The apple at (3,0) is still available and I can chain it after (3,2). The apple at (1,5) is further and might be taken by enemy if it goes UP to (4,5) and then left.\n- Given that, DOWN seems slightly better for chaining to (3,0).\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (3,2) and eating the apple, my head will be at (3,2) with body length 6. The enemy might be at (4,3) or (4,5). From (3,2), I can go DOWN to (3,1) (safe) towards (3,0), or LEFT to (2,2) (safe) to explore the left side. Avoid UP (own body) and RIGHT (if enemy is at (4,3)). Prioritize getting (3,0) next.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, let's check carefully).\n    - If I move DOWN to (3,1) and eat no apple, my body becomes: Head (3,1), Body: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]. The tail (3,7) is dropped.\n    - From (3,1), next turn:\n        - UP (3,2): Own body. **Unsafe.**\n        - DOWN (3,0): Empty, and has an apple! **Safe and lucrative.**\n        - LEFT (2,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n        - RIGHT (4,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - So after moving DOWN, I still have 3 safe moves next turn, including the direct path to the apple at (3,0).\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT this turn does not get me closer to the immediate high-value target (3,0) as efficiently.\n\n**Conclusion and Plan:**\nThe optimal move is **DOWN** to position myself to eat the apple at (3,0) on the next turn.

This gives me 6 apples and extends my lead (enemy has 4). However, it leaves me with only 2 safe moves next turn and at risk of being trapped on the bottom edge.\n- **Safety Consideration:** Moving DOWN to eat the apple is safe this turn, but reduces future options. It is not immediately fatal, but requires careful planning to escape the bottom.\n- **Alternative:** Skipping the apple this turn (by moving LEFT or RIGHT) preserves more options and avoids the bottom edge trap. However, it delays gaining an apple and gives the enemy a chance to catch up.\n- **Long-term:** Since the enemy is not threatening, I can afford to be a bit greedy. But I must not get trapped.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nIf I move DOWN to eat the apple, next turn I must move either LEFT or RIGHT to avoid death. Then I can work my way up. The board has other apples (e.g., (0,0) and (2,3)) that I can target from the bottom row.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe immediate gain of the apple at (3,0) is too valuable to pass up, as it solidifies my lead. I will move DOWN to collect it. Then next turn, I will move LEFT (to (2,0)) or RIGHT (to (4,0)) to avoid the bottom edge and plan my escape.\n\nDOWN",
