If I move UP to (8, 5), I am at a distance of 2 from (7, 6). If I move LEFT to (7, 4), I am also at a distance of 2 from (7, 6). \n\nBetween UP and LEFT:\n- UP to (8, 5) puts me closer to (7, 6) and (6, 6).\n- LEFT to (7, 4) puts me closer to (5, 5).\n\nI will choose UP to target the (7, 6) and (6, 6) cluster, which is slightly further from the enemy snake than the (5, 5) apple.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nHead toward the apple at (7, 6). After collecting it, immediately target (6, 6). Watch Snake #1 to see if they secure (5, 5) or move toward the left side of the board.\n\nUP",

Moves into open space above Snake #1.\n    - **RIGHT:** (8, 7). **SAFE**. Moves into the narrow column between my body and the edge.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Snake #1 (Enemy):** Its head is at (1, 1). Its body forms a long horizontal wall at Y=6 from X=1 to X=7.\n- **Apples:** Nearest is (8, 6). Others are (8, 1), (2, 0), (0, 0), (0, 4).\n- **Evaluating RIGHT (8, 7):** This move puts me in a very tight spot (8, 7) surrounded by my own body at (8, 9), (9, 7), (9, 8). I would have to go down to (8, 6) to get the apple, but my tail at (9, 6) and (9, 5) might trap me against Snake #1's tail.\n- **Evaluating LEFT (6, 7):** This is the most open area. From (6, 7), I can move along the top of Snake #1's horizontal body wall. This gives me room to maneuver and eventually loop around to the left side where most apples are located.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 7). This avoids the immediate congestion on the right and keeps me away from the wall at Y=6.

Taking the **LEFT** path allows me to bypass the horizontal barrier created by Snake #1 (which ends at X=1 on the Y=6 line). Once I clear its \"tail\" end, I can move down (Y < 6) to access the apples at (0, 4) and (0,0).

Body occupies a large vertical and horizontal span (X=1 from Y=0 to Y=6, and X=1 to X=4 at Y=6).\n*   **Apples:** (0, 4), (8, 6), (8, 1), (9, 4), (3, 3).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP:** (2, 8). **SAFE**. Moves into open space.\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 6). **LETHAL**. This is occupied by Snake #1's body.\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 7). **SAFE**. Moves into open space above Snake #1's horizontal segment.\n*   **RIGHT:** (3, 7). **LETHAL** (Backwards into body).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nI am currently located above a horizontal wall created by Snake #1 at Y=6 (from X=1 to X=4). To get to the apples at (3, 3), (0, 4), or the bottom-right, I need to get around this wall.\n*   Moving **LEFT** toward (1, 7) puts me directly above Snake #1's body at (1, 6). I cannot go DOWN there. I would have to continue to (0, 7) then down the far-left wall.\n*   Moving **UP** toward (2, 8) gives me more space to see how Snake #1's tail moves (it is currently clearing out from the bottom-left).\n\nHowever, looking at the board, the most immediate \"exit\" to the lower half of the board is to go around the left side or wait for Snake #1 to move its body. Since Snake #1's head is at (0, 1) and moving, its tail at (4, 6) will move soon. But for this turn, moving LEFT is the most direct way to probe for an opening on the left flank.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 7). From there, I will likely need to move to (0, 7) and then DOWN once Snake #1's body at (0, 6) or (1, 6) is no longer there, or simply to stay mobile while waiting for the center to clear.\n\nLEFT",

However, the score is 8 to 13; I need apples. If Snake #1 moves to (0, 4), I must be ready to turn. Given the current configuration, moving DOWN is necessary to maintain pressure and path toward the bottom apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (0, 6). Monitor Snake #1's head closely.

Body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\n*   **Apples:** (8, 6), (8, 1), (9, 4), (3, 3), (6, 5).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP:** Moves to (0, 7). **Lethal** (Backwards into body).\n2.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds. **Lethal**.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (1, 6). **Lethal** (Snake #1's body is at (1, 6)).\n4.  **DOWN:** Moves to (0, 5). **Safe.**\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n*   Snake #1 is at (0, 4). If it moves UP to (0, 5) while I move DOWN to (0, 5), we will have a head-on collision and both die.\n*   However, let's look at Snake #1's options. Its body occupies (0, 3) and (1, 4). It *cannot* move DOWN or RIGHT. It *must* move UP to (0, 5).\n*   If I move DOWN, a collision at (0, 5) is guaranteed.\n*   Are there any other options? Looking at the board, (1, 6) is occupied by Snake #1's body, and (0, 7) is my own body.\n*   Wait, looking closely at Snake #1's body list: `[(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)]`.\n*   My head is at (0, 6). My current body parts are at (0, 7) and (1, 7).\n*   Is RIGHT (1, 6) truly lethal? Yes, Snake #1's body is there.\n*   Is DOWN (0, 5) safe? Snake #1 is at (0, 4). Its body is at (0, 3) and (1, 4). It is forced to move to (0, 5).\n*   If I move DOWN, we both move to (0, 5) and die.\n*   However, I have no other moves. UP is my body, LEFT is wall, RIGHT is enemy body.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn this specific turn, I am forced into a confrontation. If Snake #1 moves to (0, 5), and I am forced to move to (0, 5), the game ends. Since I have 8 apples and they have 14, a draw/double-death results in a loss for me. However, I have no other legal moves.\n\nRIGHT",

Although moving UP could coincide with enemy #0 moving DOWN into the same cell, enemy #0 is more likely to move RIGHT toward the apple at (8,6), so the risk of a head\u2011on collision is low.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:** Continue upward to reach y\u202f=\u202f6, then prepare to turn right toward the apples at (8,6) and (9,4) while staying clear of the opponent\u2019s likely rightward move.\n\nUP",
