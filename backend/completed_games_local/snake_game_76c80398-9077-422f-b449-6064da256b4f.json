The board is 10x10, so boundaries are x [0, 9] and y [0, 9].\n\n**Immediate Move Safety Check:**\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 2)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (1, 2) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** There are no snake bodies listed (I am size 1, Enemy #1 is size 1). I cannot hit myself unless I reverse, which is not happening here. Enemy body is at (8, 3) \u2014 far away. The board confirms empty cells at (1, 2) and surrounding.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 0)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (1, 0) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** No immediate body collisions.\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but leads to a corner.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 1)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (0, 1) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** No immediate body collisions.\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but leads to the left wall, potentially reducing future maneuverability.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 1)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (2, 1) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** No immediate body collisions.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe goal is to collect apples (currently 5 on the board) while staying alive and keeping options open.\n*   **Movement towards Apples:** The nearest apples relative to my position (1, 1) are at (2, 0) [distance ~1.4] and (2, 8) [distance ~7]. There is also an apple at (4, 3).\n*   **Option 1 (LEFT):** Moving to (0, 1). This positions me against the wall. While I can collect the apple at (2, 0) eventually (by moving Down then Right), starting against a wall reduces my immediate options to just two directions (Up or Right) on the next turn. This limits flexibility.\n*   **Option 2 (DOWN):** Moving to (1, 0). This puts me in the bottom row (y=0). While I can still move Left to (0, 0) or Right to (2, 0) (approaching an apple), my vertical maneuverability is restricted (only UP is possible).\n*   **Option 3 (RIGHT):** Moving to (2, 1). This moves me closer to the apple at (2, 0) (1 move away via DOWN) and positions me centrally relative to the other apples at (4, 3) and (7, 2). It keeps all four directions available on the next turn (except immediate reverse, but Up/Down/Left/Right are all viable directions depending on needs).\n*   **Option 4 (UP):** Moving to (1, 2). This moves me toward the cluster of apples at the top (2, 8), (5, 9), and (7, 2). It maintains open space.\n\n**Comparing Right vs Up:**\n*   **Right (2, 1):** Immediate proximity to the bottom apple (2, 0). Can be reached in 1 more turn (Down).\n*   **Up (1, 2):** Good central positioning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (2, 1) is the strongest immediate move. It avoids walls and corners (unlike Left/Down), keeps all movement options open, and positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (2, 0) next turn if I choose. Alternatively, from (2, 1), I can pivot Up to chase the upper apples. It also positions me to potentially intercept the enemy snake at (8, 3) if they move North-West, but my primary goal is apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nSecure the apple at (2, 0) in the next turn by moving DOWN, then scan for the next closest apple (likely at 4,3 or 7,2). Avoid the left wall entirely to maintain maneuverability against Enemy #1.\n\nRIGHT",

The board is 10x10, so boundaries are x [0, 9] and y [0, 9].\n\n**Immediate Move Safety Check:**\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 2)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (2, 2) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** Cell (2, 2) appears empty on the board. Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 0)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (2, 0) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** Cell (2, 0) contains an apple.\n    *   **Result:** Safe and productive (eat apple). However, the position (2, 0) is against the bottom wall, which might limit maneuverability slightly on subsequent turns. Since I can only eat 1 apple per turn and I am currently size 1, I cannot block the apple from spawning behind me immediately. I should still evaluate if a different move is better for positioning.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 1)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (1, 1) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** Cell (1, 1) is currently empty.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. This moves me back to the previous position (if I moved here from there), but let's assume I am at (2,1) now. This keeps me on the edge.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 1)):**\n    *   **Boundary:** (3, 1) is within bounds.\n    *   **Collision:** Cell (3, 1) appears empty.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. Moves me towards the center (x=3).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\n*   **Option DOWN:** I can eat the apple at (2, 0) immediately. This is a guaranteed point and growth. However, (2, 0) is a wall-adjacent cell. While good for score, it restricts future moves. Given the board state, I should consider if there is a safer or more strategic opening.\n*   **Option RIGHT:** Moving to (3, 1) moves me horizontally toward the center. From (3, 1), I have access to apples at (4, 3) and (7, 2). It also keeps me away from the wall.\n*   **Option UP:** Moving to (2, 2) moves me vertically. From here, I can reach the apple at (4, 3) in one turn (Right, Up) or approach the top cluster.\n*   **Option LEFT:** Moving to (1, 1) is a retreat and keeps me on the left edge, which is generally less flexible than the center.\n\n**Comparison:**\nI want to position myself to eat multiple apples efficiently. The apple at (2, 0) is an easy target, but committing to the wall early can be dangerous if the enemy (Snake #1 at 8,2) cuts me off or if apples spawn in bad spots.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (3, 1) is a strong central positioning move. It allows me to pivot towards the apple at (4, 3) or (7, 2) next turn. It keeps all directions open.\nMoving **UP** to (2, 2) is also good, but \"RIGHT\" feels slightly more central given the x-coordinate differences.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"Last Move Rationale\" provided in the prompt, the previous move was **RIGHT** (from 1,1 to 2,1). The rationale stated: *\"Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 1) is the strongest immediate move... positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (2, 0) next turn if I choose.\"*\nSince I am at (2,1) now, I have arrived at the position intended to reach the apple at (2,0). The plan explicitly stated: *\"Secure the apple at (2, 0) in the next turn by moving DOWN\"*.\n\nFollowing the established long-term plan is a valid strategy unless the situation has changed. The situation has not changed drastically; I am still alive, and the apple is still there. Eating the apple grows my snake, which is the primary win condition. While I have concerns about the wall, the apple at (2,0) is the closest reachable apple (1 move away). The apple at (7,2) is far away (Manhattan distance ~6). The apple at (4,3) is distance ~3. Eating the immediate apple is a good play.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the \"Next Turn\" logic. If I go DOWN to (2,0), I eat the apple. My new tail will remain at (2,1) temporarily. I will be at (2,0) facing the wall.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I don't eat an apple. I am at (3,1).\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I am at (2,2).\n\nLet's check the apple locations again.\n(2, 8)\n(5, 9)\n(2, 0) <-- Immediate\n(7, 2)\n(4, 3)\n\nDistance from (2,1) to (2,0) is 1.\nDistance to (4,3) is |4-2| + |3-1| = 4.\nDistance to (7,2) is |7-2| + |2-1| = 6.\n\nThere is no apple closer than (2,0). Eating it is efficient.\n\n**Risk Analysis of DOWN:**\nMoving DOWN to (2,0).\nIf I eat the apple, I grow.\nIf an enemy snake moves into (2,1) (my tail next turn), they die. But I am currently size 1. My tail *was* at (1,1). When I move to (2,1), my tail stays at (1,1) until I eat.\nWhen I move to (2,0), I eat. My tail will eventually move from (1,1) to (2,1).\nThe cell (2,0) is a wall. This is only dangerous if I get boxed in.\nHowever, I am at turn 1/150. There is plenty of space.\n\n**Comparison with RIGHT:**\nRIGHT to (3,1).\nFrom (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2) towards (4,3).\nFrom (3,1), I can go RIGHT to (4,1).\nFrom (3,1), I can go DOWN to (3,0).\nFrom (3,1), I can go LEFT to (2,1).\nRIGHT seems flexible.\n\n**Comparison with UP:**\nUP to (2,2).\nFrom (2,2), I can go RIGHT to (3,2) towards (4,3).\nFrom (2,2), I can go UP to (2,3).\nFrom (2,2), I can go LEFT to (1,2).\nFrom (2,2), I can go DOWN to (2,1).\nAlso flexible.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe plan established in the previous turn was to go DOWN. It is a reliable plan. The prompt asks me to incorporate the \"last move rationale\" which explicitly said \"Secure the apple at (2, 0) in the next turn by moving DOWN\".\nIf I deviate, I am abandoning a clear plan to eat an immediate apple for a slightly safer position.\nIn Snake games, early growth is very powerful. It increases the chance of the opponent running into your body later and increases score.\nAlso, looking at the board, Snake #1 is at (8,2). They are very far away. The risk of immediate collision is low.\nI will stick to the plan and eat the apple.\n\nLong-term plan:\nEat the apple at (2,0). Then look to pivot towards the central cluster of apples (4,3) or (7,2). Avoid getting trapped on the bottom wall.\n\n**Choosing move:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",
