Let\u2019s check: enemy at (1, 7) could move LEFT to (0, 7) this turn \u2014 if that happens, I move UP now to (0, 6), enemy moves LEFT to (0, 7), no collision this turn. Next turn, if I go UP to (0, 7), enemy might move somewhere else, but if enemy stays at (0, 7), then moving UP would be head-on collision. So some risk but not immediate.  \n   - Safer to go toward apple maybe.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 4)**  \n   - Next turn: UP (back to 0,5), DOWN (0, 3 apple), LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 4).  \n   - (0, 3) has apple, so DOWN next turn gets food safely unless enemy moves into (0, 3) before me \u2014 enemy is far at (1, 7), can\u2019t reach (0, 3) in 1 turn. So apple is safe to get in 2 turns.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (1, 5)**  \n   - Next turn: UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5).  \n   - Moves away from closest apple but more central position, more options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Which is safest long-term?**  \nAt length 1, I need to grow to avoid being killed easily by enemy head collisions later. Getting the apple at (0, 3) grows me to length 2, which gives me a body that can kill enemy if they run into it.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now, next turn DOWN again eats apple unless enemy interferes \u2014 but enemy is far.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I\u2019m moving away from that apple, giving enemy time to possibly get closer to it.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove DOWN now to (0, 4). Next turn move DOWN to (0, 3) to eat apple, unless enemy blocks. That gives me growth early.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:**  \n\nDOWN",

No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n2. Eating apple gives length 2, which protects against future head-on collisions (enemy dies if they hit my body).  \n3.

I can go DOWN now to get closer, but that puts me on the bottom edge (y=0) with fewer future safe moves. Better to approach diagonally via RIGHT first, then DOWN later, to keep flexibility. Enemy is far away and not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final decision:**  \nRIGHT maintains flexibility (4 safe moves next turn) while still making progress toward (5, 0).

My tail is at (5, 0) now, so (6, 1) will be empty next turn unless I grow).\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2013 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 2) \u2013 apple.\n\nAll 4 directions possibly safe next turn if enemy not there. Good.\n\n**LEFT to (5, 1):**\nFrom (5, 1):\n- UP \u2192 (5, 2) \u2013 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0) \u2013 empty next turn (tail currently at (5, 0), will move if no apple eaten).\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1) \u2013 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1) \u2013 empty.\n\nAlso 4 options likely safe.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 1):**\nFrom (7, 1):\n- UP \u2192 (7, 2) \u2013 apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 0) \u2013 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 1) \u2013 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 1) \u2013 empty.\n\nAlso 4 options likely safe.\n\nAll 3 moves give good future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\nClosest apple: (7, 2), Manhattan distance from (6, 1) = 2 (UP 1, RIGHT 1).\n- UP to (6, 2) \u2192 distance to (7, 2) = 1 (RIGHT 1).\n- LEFT to (5, 1) \u2192 distance to (7, 2) = 3.\n- RIGHT to (7, 1) \u2192 distance to (7, 2) = 1 (UP 1).\n\nUP and RIGHT both put me 1 step away from apple (7, 2).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement and apple risk:**\nEnemy at (7, 5) might go RIGHT to (8, 5) apple, or DOWN to (7, 4) toward (8, 4) apple, or UP to (7, 6).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 1) and then UP to (7, 2), I\u2019m moving into column 7, which enemy could also move into later. But enemy\u2019s likely immediate apple targets are (8, 5) and (8, 4), not (7, 2) yet. However, if enemy goes DOWN to (7, 4), then next turn they could go LEFT to (6, 4) etc., not immediately threatening (7, 2).\n\nActually safest to take apple (7, 2) next turn with minimal risk: from (6, 2), I can go RIGHT to (7, 2) apple, and enemy is far enough away (5 rows above).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**\nGoing RIGHT to (7, 1) reduces my DOWN option (board edge at y=0). From (7, 1), DOWN to (7, 0) leaves only UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn \u2014 still okay, but less central.\n\nGoing UP to (6, 2) keeps me central with more escape routes.\n\nLEFT to (5, 1) takes me away from nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**\nUP gets me closest to apple while keeping central position and future options open.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 2), if safe, go RIGHT to (7, 2) to eat apple and grow. Monitor enemy at (7, 5)/(7, 4)/(8, 5) to avoid head-on collision. If enemy moves toward (7, 2), consider alternate route like UP to (6, 3) instead.\n\n---\n\nUP",

New body: head (0,8), then (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2). Next turn from (0,8): possible moves UP (wall), DOWN (to (0,7) \u2013 my body after move? Wait, (0,7) will be my neck after growth, so illegal), LEFT (wall), RIGHT (1,8) \u2013 empty. So only RIGHT possible from (0,8) next turn \u2192 risky because only one move.  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 7)**: No apple, no growth. Body: head (1,7), then (0,7),(0,6),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(0,2). Next turn from (1,7): possible moves UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7) \u2013 body? (0,7) will be my neck after move, so illegal, RIGHT (2,7). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT available \u2192 better mobility.\n\nSo UP gives apple but traps me at top-left corner with only RIGHT next turn. RIGHT gives no apple but keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety:**  \nIf I go UP and eat apple, next turn I must go RIGHT to (1,8). That\u2019s okay, but then from (1,8) I\u2019ll have more options. Enemy will be at (9,8) after this turn, far away.  \nThe risk of going UP is low immediate danger, but I must ensure next turn\u2019s only move RIGHT is safe: (1,8) is empty now and likely next turn.  \n\nGoing RIGHT now avoids corner but delays apple. Apples at (4,5) and (4,7) are reachable later. Enemy is far ahead in apples, so I need to collect apples faster but also stay alive.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP is safe this turn, gets apple, and next turn\u2019s forced RIGHT is also safe (no enemy can reach (1,8) in 1 turn from (9,8)).  \nRIGHT is safe but gives no apple and enemy pulls further ahead.  \nGiven win condition is most apples at end, catching up matters. I\u2019ll take apple now.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter UP \u2192 RIGHT to (1,8). Then from (1,8) consider moving toward (4,7) apple while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body on right side. Keep an eye on enemy head movement; it will likely go down from (9,8) toward (4,5) or (4,7). Try to reach apples before it does.\n\nUP",

I need to stay alive and collect apples faster. Going UP traps me in corner with only one escape next turn, which could be dangerous if enemy moves toward center.  \nRIGHT opens path toward apples at (4,7) or (4,5) via (2,8) \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 etc., while maintaining flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT is safer long-term, avoids corner trap, and keeps multiple options next turn. UP is too risky despite no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to (1,8), then aim toward (4,7) apple while staying aware of enemy\u2019s long body on right side.

(3,2) is left-down from head.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP (4,9): next moves: UP wall, DOWN body (4,8), LEFT (3,9) empty, RIGHT (5,9) empty \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN (4,7): eat apple, grow by 1. Next moves from (4,7): UP back to (4,8) \u2013 body? My body after move: head (4,7), then (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6) \u2014 so (4,8) is body, so UP illegal. DOWN (4,6) empty, LEFT (3,7) empty, RIGHT (5,7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- RIGHT (5,8): next moves: UP (5,9) empty, DOWN (5,7) empty, LEFT (4,8) body, RIGHT (6,8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nDOWN and RIGHT both give 3 moves next turn, UP worse.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nEating apple at (4,7) now gets me to 7 apples vs enemy\u2019s 10, but more importantly, it grows me safely while staying near other apples (4,5).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I could go DOWN next to (5,7), then left to apple (4,7) later, but that\u2019s slower.  \n\nGiven enemy is far right, going DOWN into (4,7) is safe this turn and opens more central mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nMy long body is along left edge (x=0, y 6\u20138) and top-left. Moving DOWN then possibly LEFT/DOWN later toward (4,5) keeps me in open area.  \n\nUP (4,9) is risky because next turn only 2 moves, could trap me near top.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN is best:  \n1. Safe this turn.  \n2. Eats apple now.  \n3. Good mobility next turn (3 moves).  \n4. Avoids trapping myself.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nEat apple (4,7) now. Next turn from (4,7), consider going DOWN toward (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) apple, or LEFT toward (3,7) \u2192 (3,2) apple later. Watch enemy movement \u2014 they may move toward center, but currently far away. Avoid moving too far right into enemy territory until necessary.  \n\nDOWN",

But they might move away. Risk exists but not guaranteed. Safer to avoid RIGHT next turn if enemy is near. Still, eating apple gives growth and more space later.  \n- **LEFT to (3, 6)** \u2013 next turn: UP (3, 7) empty, DOWN (3, 5) empty, LEFT (2, 6) empty, RIGHT (4, 6) empty (since I moved). 4 safe moves next turn.  \n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** \u2013 next turn: UP (5, 7) empty, DOWN (5, 5) possible enemy location this turn if they go LEFT, LEFT (4, 6) empty, RIGHT (6, 6) possible enemy location this turn if they go UP. Risk of adjacent enemy next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEating (4, 5) now is good because it\u2019s close, grows me, and enemy is not adjacent.  \nLEFT (3, 6) keeps mobility high and avoids enemy entirely.  \nRIGHT (5, 6) moves toward enemy and risks future head-on.\n\nBest immediate: DOWN to eat apple, then next turn reassess. If enemy moves to (5, 5) this turn, I\u2019ll be at (4, 5) with them adjacent left; I can avoid moving RIGHT next turn and go DOWN/LEFT/UP instead.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid traps**  \nMy tail is at (0, 7) and will move to (0, 8) next turn if I don\u2019t eat? Wait: if I eat apple, tail stays at (0, 7) because growth adds segment at tail after move. If I don\u2019t eat, tail moves forward to (0, 8). So eating keeps tail where it is, opening a little space near left wall.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo DOWN to eat (4, 5). Next turn, avoid moving RIGHT if enemy is at (5, 5). Instead go DOWN to (4, 4) or LEFT to (3, 5) to stay safe and aim for (3, 2) apple later. Keep distance from enemy who is longer.\n\nDOWN",

Avoid hugging the left wall if the enemy controls that corridor.\n\nUP",

Then consider moving toward (4,0) or circling back toward (0,0) depending on tail movement. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if enemy moves south, be ready to avoid. Keep options open, avoid trapping myself in corners.  \n\nRIGHT",

After eating (4,0), my body grows so tail will linger longer, but board still has space. Enemy is far north; his body blocks top rows but he may move south. If I eat apple, next turn I can go LEFT to (3,0) then toward (0,0) or RIGHT toward right-side apples later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next few turns**  \nMove DOWN now to eat (4,0). Next turn, from (4,0), avoid DOWN (off board). Choose LEFT (3,0) or RIGHT (5,0) based on enemy positions. Then aim for (0,0) while keeping escape routes.

Moving RIGHT now to (7, 1) also works, but I\u2019ll be closer to bottom edge\u2014still okay. However, moving UP opens more vertical space and keeps me central.  \n\nAlso note my tail is at (0, 5) and will move slowly leftward as I progress, so my body will clear over time.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nMove UP now to (6, 2), then likely RIGHT to (7, 2), then continue toward apples at (9, 3) etc. Keep monitoring enemy head movement each turn to avoid head-on collisions. Avoid getting pinned against my own body or board edges.\n\n**Final choice**  \nUP",

Immediately drops onto the apple row and sets up a quick right-move to (8,5).\n\nSafety check:\n- No enemy head is close enough to force a head-on on any of these cells this turn (enemy #0 head at (6,2)).\n- None of UP/DOWN/RIGHT move into any snake body or off-board.\n- All three legal moves leave multiple follow-ups; no immediate forced trap.\n\nChoice and short rationale:\n- I choose DOWN. It places me directly onto the apple row (y=5) and puts me in position to take (8,5) next turn (or to contest/secure the nearby apples at (9,5),(9,4),(9,3)). This move advances the primary objective (eat apples) while preserving escape options (I still have space to the right and below). RIGHT is also reasonable, but DOWN gets me onto the apple row one move sooner and reduces the distance to the cluster without committing into a tighter area.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- From (7,5) aim to go RIGHT to (8,5) next turn to take that apple, then proceed to (9,5) and then downward along the cluster at x=9 for the remaining apples if uncontested.\n- Keep columns x>=6 as escape corridor; avoid turning left into my long body on the next few moves so I don\u2019t trap myself.\n- If the enemy unexpectedly moves toward the cluster aggressively, avoid head-on collisions \u2014 preserve life over a contested apple.\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP keeps same horizontal distance but reduces vertical distance to (9, 4) and (9, 5). LEFT moves away from the apple cluster.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n- **UP to (6, 4)**: next turn from (6, 4): UP (6, 5) empty, DOWN (6, 3) empty (tail moving?), LEFT (5, 4) empty, RIGHT (7, 4) empty \u2192 4 safe moves possible.  \n- **LEFT to (5, 3)**: next turn from (5, 3): UP (5, 4) empty, DOWN (5, 2) my body?, LEFT (4, 3) empty, RIGHT (6, 3) empty \u2192 at least 3 safe moves (DOWN might be safe if tail moves).  \n- **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: next turn from (7, 3): UP (7, 4) empty, DOWN (7, 2) empty, LEFT (6, 3) empty, RIGHT (8, 3) empty \u2192 4 safe moves possible.  \n\nAll three moves give good mobility. LEFT slightly riskier because (5, 2) is currently my body until tail moves.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy is at (7, 5) and may move DOWN to (7, 4), LEFT to (6, 5), or RIGHT to (8, 5) (apple). If enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 5), it will eat and grow, staying near that cluster. I want to reach that cluster before enemy consumes more apples. Moving RIGHT now gets me to (7, 3), closer to (9, 3) and positions me to go UP toward apples next turn while keeping distance from enemy\u2019s possible current move. Moving UP to (6, 4) also progresses toward apples but is slightly farther horizontally.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s proximity to the apple cluster, I should move toward it aggressively but safely. RIGHT seems best:  \n- Puts me at (7, 3), adjacent to (7, 4) which is a possible enemy move this turn, but enemy heads won\u2019t collide (different cells).  \n- Next turn from (7, 3) I can go UP to (7, 4) if enemy isn\u2019t there, or RIGHT to (8, 3) toward apples.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nMove RIGHT now to (7, 3), then aim for apple at (9, 3) via (8, 3) and (9, 3) if safe. Monitor enemy movement closely; if enemy moves to (8, 5) this turn, it will grow and its tail will stay longer, but I can still try to grab (9, 3) and (9, 4). Keep tail clearance in mind\u2014my tail is at (0, 3) moving slowly. Avoid getting trapped in top-right corner; plan an exit route after eating an apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, after growth my body will be [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), ...], so (8, 3) occupied. LEFT unsafe. UP maybe unsafe if enemy moves to (9, 4). DOWN safe. RIGHT off board unsafe. So only DOWN guaranteed safe, maybe UP if enemy not there. Risk of being trapped in top-right corner after eating.  \n- **UP to (8, 4)**:  \n  Next turn from (8, 4): UP (8, 5) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (8, 3) empty, LEFT (7, 4) empty, RIGHT (9, 4) apple (maybe eaten by enemy this turn). At least 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n- **DOWN to (8, 2)**:  \n  Next turn from (8, 2): UP (8, 3) empty, DOWN (8, 1) empty, LEFT (7, 2) empty, RIGHT (9, 2) empty \u2192 all 4 safe. Good mobility.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy likely moves DOWN to (9, 4) to eat apple and grow. If I move RIGHT to (9, 3), enemy could move DOWN to (9, 4) same turn, then next turn enemy could move LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3)? Wait, enemy would be at (9, 4), then could move LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3) if I\u2019m there \u2014 that would be head-on collision if we both move into same cell, but we move simultaneously so risky. If enemy stays at (9, 4) and I move to (9, 3), I\u2019m adjacent diagonally, not same cell. But after eating (9, 3), I\u2019ll have only DOWN safe next turn, which could lead to dead end if enemy blocks.  \n\nUP to (8, 4) puts me adjacent to enemy if enemy moves DOWN to (9, 4) \u2014 not same cell, so safe this turn. Next turn I could go LEFT/DOWN to retreat.  \n\nDOWN to (8, 2) keeps options open, avoids immediate risk, but delays apple eating.  \n\nGiven enemy has 15 apples vs my 12, I need to catch up, so grabbing (9, 3) is tempting, but must avoid trap.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT to (9, 3) is risky but gives immediate apple and growth. However, after growth, my only safe move next turn likely DOWN to (9, 2), which is cornered (only LEFT possible afterward). That\u2019s dangerous if enemy loops around.  \n\nUP to (8, 4) keeps me close to apples but not committing to corner.  \n\nDOWN to (8, 2) safest for future mobility but loses time.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (9, 5) and likely moves DOWN to (9, 4), if I go RIGHT to (9, 3), we\u2019d be adjacent vertically; enemy could move LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3) next turn. If enemy moves DOWN, we collide head-on if I stay still. But I could move DOWN to (9, 2) to avoid. Still risky.  \n\nBetter to take UP this turn, positioning to possibly get (9, 4) next if enemy doesn\u2019t eat it this turn, or retreat safely.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf enemy eats (9, 4), consider moving LEFT/DOWN to open area. If (9, 4) still there, maybe go RIGHT to eat it if safe. Monitor enemy head movement.  \n\nUP",

Actually (5, 5) is apple now, so empty except apple. But wait \u2014 enemy body at (5, 6) is close, but (5, 5) itself is free. But moving RIGHT into (5, 5) would be safe unless enemy moves there \u2014 enemy head at (9, 0) now, can only go to (8, 0), so enemy can\u2019t reach (5, 5) next turn. So RIGHT (5, 5) safe next turn? Let\u2019s check my own body: after I move UP to (4, 5), my body will be: head at (4, 5), then (4, 4), then (5, 4), (6, 4), ... So (5, 5) is not in my body next turn. So from (4, 5), UP unsafe, DOWN unsafe, LEFT safe, RIGHT safe \u2192 2 safe options next turn.  \n\n**DOWN (4, 3):**  \nFrom (4, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (4, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (4, 2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (3, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (5, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n2 safe options (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**LEFT (3, 4):**  \nFrom (3, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (3, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (3, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (2, 4): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n3 safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nSo LEFT gives best mobility next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (0, 0), (1, 1), (9, 7), (5, 5), (8, 9).  \n- (5, 5) is closest but moving UP to (4, 5) doesn\u2019t eat it yet \u2014 would need RIGHT next turn to eat it. That\u2019s possible but risky if enemy moves toward that area later.  \n- (1, 1) is reachable via LEFT then DOWN over several moves.  \n- (0, 0) also reachable but far.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer, I should avoid confrontation and focus on safe growth. Apple at (5, 5) is tempting but going UP now gives only 2 safe next moves, while LEFT gives 3 safe next moves and moves toward (1, 1).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nMy current area (columns 4\u20138 rows 3\u20134) is getting tight because my body blocks RIGHT and part of DOWN/UP. LEFT opens more space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 18 apples (length 18+2 = 20 segments). I have 12 apples (length 12+2 = 14 segments). Avoid enemy body on right side (cols 5\u20139). Work toward left-side apples (1, 1) and (0, 0). Keep mobility high each turn. Next turn from (3, 4), consider moving LEFT or DOWN to open space further.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (8, 1): board shows '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 0): board shows 'T' (my tail at (5,0) but (7,0) is '.'? Wait, check board: column 7 row 0 is '.' indeed) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 0): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can move UP or LEFT. Both are far from my possible moves (3,5), (3,3), (2,4) this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility from each safe move**  \n\n**UP (3, 5):**  \nFrom (3, 5) next turn:  \n- UP (3, 6): enemy body (enemy at (3,6)? Check: enemy body list has (3,6) yes) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (2, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN (3, 3):**  \nFrom (3, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (3, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3, 2): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (2, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT (2, 4):**  \nFrom (2, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 5): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (2, 3): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (1, 4): '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 4): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nLEFT gives best mobility next turn again.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apples: (1, 1) is 3 moves away via LEFT then DOWN.

Enemy is far at (8,0).  \n\nBut enemy is longer (18 apples vs my 12), so avoid risky area near enemy body. Enemy occupies right side columns 5\u20139 in many rows. Moving toward (1,1) seems safer.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nMy body blocks my right side, so moving LEFT opens more free space on left side of board.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nKeep moving left toward (1,1) apple, then possibly (0,0).

That\u2019s efficient.  \nRIGHT to (2,2) leads toward center but more open space, could aim for (5,5) later.  \n\nBut eating apple now is good \u2014 growth also extends my body, but careful about trapping myself later. Currently my body is mostly top-right, so bottom-left is free space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nTake (1,1) now, (0,0) next if safe, then maybe head toward (5,5) while avoiding enemy body on right side. Keep an eye on enemy head movement \u2014 enemy likely going DOWN or LEFT this turn, far from me.  \n\nBest choice: DOWN for immediate apple, good mobility, safe from head-on collision.  \n\nDOWN",

Need to collect apples quickly.  \nLEFT now \u2192 next turn either DOWN to (0, 0) apple or UP to (0, 2) apple. That\u2019s efficient growth.  \nIf I go RIGHT, I\u2019m safer in terms of space but farther from apples, which lets enemy extend lead.  \n\nGiven the win condition (most apples at end if alive), I should prioritize apple gathering while staying safe. LEFT seems best for that.  \n\nLEFT",

The biggest risks for me are moving into cramped areas near x>=7,y>=4 or stepping onto a cell another head could contest. Both UP and LEFT are safe from immediate head-on collisions this turn.\n\nChoice rationale and short plan:\n- Prefer preserving options and avoiding the tight corridor on the right. LEFT to (4,1) keeps three escape options and avoids moving onto the bottom row or into the congested area around y=4.\n- Short-term: continue westward while watching the enemy\u2019s moves; if the central apple (5,5) becomes reachable without forcing me into a choke, pivot north then.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down step-by-step.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 My current position and safe moves**  \nMy head: (0, 1)  \nMy body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3)]  \n\nFrom (0, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 2): apple, empty now.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 0): apple, empty now.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves and head-on risk**  \nEnemy head: (5, 1)  \nEnemy body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]  \n\nFrom (5, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1): enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (0, 2), DOWN (0, 0).  \nCheck overlap: enemy could go UP to (5, 2) or DOWN to (5, 0) or LEFT to (4, 1). Neither overlaps with my possible next head positions \u2192 no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (0, 0), (9, 7), (5, 5), (8, 9), (0, 2)  \n\nBoth UP and DOWN lead directly to apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \n\n**UP to (0, 2)** \u2013 apple eaten \u2192 I grow by 1, new length 14.  \nFrom (0, 2) after eating apple:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 1): my old head\u2019s position, but now my neck after move? Wait \u2014 after moving, my body becomes: new head (0, 2), then old head (0, 1) becomes segment 2, then rest of body. So (0, 1) is my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe (currently at (1, 2) in my old body).  \n\nSo after UP-apple, safe moves: only UP to (0, 3). That\u2019s 1 safe move \u2192 risky.  \n\n**DOWN to (0, 0)** \u2013 apple eaten \u2192 length 14.  \nFrom (0, 0) after eating apple:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 1): my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 0): empty.  \n\nSo after DOWN-apple, safe moves: only RIGHT to (1, 0). That\u2019s also 1 safe move \u2192 risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Which is less risky next turn?**  \nAfter UP-apple: only (0, 3) safe. From (0, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 2): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT/RIGHT off board/body \u2192 only UP from (0, 3) is safe. So chain: (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 etc. Trapped along left wall, but can go up column 0 until y=9, then forced right.  \n\nAfter DOWN-apple: only (1, 0) safe. From (1, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \n\nSo chain: (0, 0) \u2192 (1, 0) \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 then maybe more options.  \n\nComparing:  \nUP-apple path: column 0 upwards has no immediate apples nearby except maybe later.  \nDOWN-apple path: along bottom row (y=0) might lead to apple at (5, 5) eventually, but enemy is near there.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy proximity**  \nEnemy at (5, 1) could move toward center. If I go UP, I\u2019m far from enemy. If I go DOWN, I\u2019m at (0, 0), enemy at least 5 cells away in Manhattan distance.  \n\nBoth are equally safe from enemy next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tie-breaker: future apple access**  \nApples left after I eat one:  \nIf I eat (0, 2), apples left: (0, 0), (9, 7), (5, 5), (8, 9).  \nIf I eat (0, 0), apples left: (0, 2), (9, 7), (5, 5), (8, 9).  \n\nFrom (0, 2) after eating, only UP to (0, 3) safe, then up to (0, 4) etc. Closest apple from there is (0, 0) but that\u2019s behind me and blocked by my body. Next closest is (5, 5) far.  \n\nFrom (0, 0) after eating, only RIGHT to (1, 0) safe, then to (2, 0), etc. Closest apple from there is (0, 2) but blocked by body; next is (5, 5).  \n\nActually, both put me in a corridor with only one safe move next turn. But UP-apple leaves me on top edge after going up, DOWN-apple leaves me on bottom edge after going right.  \n\nBottom row (y=0) from (2, 0): can go to (3, 0), (4, 0), etc., then up toward (5, 5). That might be better than being stuck on left wall.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll choose DOWN because moving right along bottom row after eating gives more space to maneuver later, whereas going up left wall is more restrictive.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter DOWN to (0, 0) and eating apple, only safe move is RIGHT to (1, 0). Take that, then assess. Try to work way toward center apples while avoiding enemy.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Wait, enemy body list: [(5, 1), (6, 1), ...] \u2192 yes, (5, 1) is enemy body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nMy only move is to (1, 0). Enemy\u2019s possible next heads: (4, 2), (4, 0), (3, 1). None is (1, 0) \u2192 no head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9, 7), (5, 5), (8, 9), (0, 2), (1, 7)  \nMoving RIGHT to (1, 0) doesn\u2019t get an apple. Closest apple after that would be (5, 5) or (0, 2), but (0, 2) is blocked by my body at (0, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after RIGHT**  \nFrom (1, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0): empty.  \n\nSo next turn after RIGHT, only safe move again is RIGHT to (2, 0). That\u2019s a corridor along bottom row y=0 until I can go up somewhere.  \n\nFrom (2, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 1): empty now.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0): empty.  \n\nSo at (2, 0), safe moves: UP, RIGHT.

If enemy goes DOWN to (4, 0), then next turn they\u2019re at (4, 0), I\u2019m at (1, 0), they could move west toward me. But I\u2019ll be at (2, 0) next turn if I go RIGHT now, so distance remains safe for now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term path**  \nAlong bottom row:  \n(1, 0) \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 then maybe (3, 0) or (2, 1) depending on situation.  \nGoal: get to an apple \u2014 closest is (5, 5), but enemy is near there. Need to survive and grow while enemy is longer (length 19 vs my 15). Enemy\u2019s tail is at (5, 6), so they might leave trail behind them soon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next few turns**  \nSince only one move is safe now, I must go RIGHT. After that, at (2, 0) I\u2019ll have UP and RIGHT options. Choose UP toward (2, 1) to start moving away from bottom edge and open more space, unless enemy blocks.

Body: [(4,3), (4,2), \u2026 (7,5)]. Length 19.  \nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,4): my body at (3,4) \u2192 unsafe for them.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,2): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,3): enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3).  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), their head will be at (3,2) next turn.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), head at (2,3).  \n\nMy safe moves:  \n- UP to (2,2): enemy could move LEFT to (2,3) \u2192 adjacent horizontally? No, (2,2) and (2,3) are not same cell, so no head-on collision this turn. But next turn enemy could threaten if I stay near.  \n- RIGHT to (3,1): enemy moving DOWN to (3,2) would be adjacent vertically next turn? Yes, (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent. That\u2019s risky.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9,7), (5,5), (8,9), (0,2), (1,7)  \nFrom (2,1):  \n- UP to (2,2): gets closer to (1,7) and (0,2), also central area for flexibility.  \n- RIGHT to (3,1): moves toward (5,5) but enemy near (3,3) likely heading that way too.\n\n(1,7) is closer in Manhattan distance from (2,2) than from (3,1). Also (0,2) is accessible from left side if my tail moves out of the way soon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next-turn mobility**  \nIf UP to (2,2):  \nFrom (2,2): UP\u2192(2,3) empty, DOWN\u2192(2,1) empty next turn, LEFT\u2192(1,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT\u2192(3,2) possibly empty unless enemy moves there.  \nBut enemy could move DOWN to (3,2) this turn, making (3,2) occupied next turn \u2192 then RIGHT from (2,2) unsafe. So UP to (2,2) gives maybe UP, DOWN safe (2 options) if enemy goes to (3,2). If enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), then (2,3) occupied \u2192 UP unsafe. So mobility could drop to 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3,1):  \nFrom (3,1): UP\u2192(3,2) possibly occupied if enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), DOWN\u2192 off board unsafe, LEFT\u2192(2,1) empty, RIGHT\u2192(4,1) empty unless enemy body? (4,1) is enemy body \u2192 unsafe already. So if enemy goes DOWN to (3,2), my moves from (3,1) next turn: only LEFT safe (1 option). That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo UP seems to preserve more options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoiding enemy head-on risk**  \nEnemy\u2019s possible next heads: (3,2) and (2,3).  \nIf I go UP to (2,2), I\u2019m adjacent to (2,3) if enemy goes LEFT \u2192 but not same cell, so safe this turn. Next turn I can avoid moving into them.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I\u2019m adjacent to (3,2) if enemy goes DOWN \u2192 again safe this turn, but next turn I could be trapped.\n\nGiven enemy length 19, they\u2019re more constrained. I should keep distance and not get pinned.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nAfter UP to (2,2), consider moving toward (1,7) via (2,3) if enemy not there, or (2,4) if blocked. Avoid (5,5) while enemy is near it. Let enemy take that apple if needed; focus on (1,7) and (0,2). Keep tail movement in mind \u2014 my tail at (7,4) will move forward as I move, freeing left side soon.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP keeps me safe this turn, better mobility next turn, and progresses toward apples while avoiding enemy collision risk.\n\nUP",

But maybe one is less likely?  \nEnemy\u2019s last move unknown, but they might prefer DOWN toward center/apple at (5,5) rather than LEFT toward my body. Still, can\u2019t rely on guessing.  \n\nSafer approach: choose a move that goes to a cell enemy *cannot* reach this turn.  \nFrom (2,2), enemy can only reach (3,2) or (2,3).  \nSo if I stay at (2,2) (not possible), or move to a different cell\u2026 wait, only UP and RIGHT are possible, and both are in enemy\u2019s reachable set.  \n\nThis means both moves risk collision. But collision only happens if enemy chooses exactly that cell.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate which risk is less dangerous**  \nIf I go UP to (2,3):  \n- Enemy goes LEFT to (2,3) \u2192 collision.  \n- Enemy goes DOWN to (3,2) \u2192 safe for me this turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,2):  \n- Enemy goes DOWN to (3,2) \u2192 collision.  \n- Enemy goes LEFT to (2,3) \u2192 safe for me this turn.  \n\nSo each move has 50% chance of collision if enemy chooses randomly.  \n\nBut enemy might prefer DOWN to (3,2) because:  \n- It\u2019s closer to apple at (5,5).  \n- It avoids moving left into my body area.  \nThat would make RIGHT more dangerous for me.  \n\nAlso, if I go UP and enemy goes DOWN, next turn I\u2019m at (2,3) and enemy at (3,2) \u2014 adjacent diagonally, not directly blocking. If I go RIGHT and enemy goes LEFT, I\u2019m at (3,2) and enemy at (2,3) \u2014 same adjacency.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider future mobility after each safe outcome**  \nIf I go UP and enemy goes DOWN (safe):  \nFrom (2,3): possible moves UP (2,4) my body, DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) my body, RIGHT (3,3) empty (enemy left it). So DOWN and RIGHT safe (2 options).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT and enemy goes LEFT (safe):  \nFrom (3,2): possible moves UP (3,3) empty, DOWN (3,1) empty, LEFT (2,2) empty, RIGHT (4,2) enemy body \u2192 unsafe. So UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (3 options).  \n\nSo if collision avoided, RIGHT gives better mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (9,7), (5,5), (8,9), (0,2), (1,7)  \nFrom (2,2):  \n- UP moves toward (1,7) and (8,9).  \n- RIGHT moves toward (5,5) and (9,7).  \n(5,5) is closer but enemy is near it; (1,7) is safer route long-term.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT have equal immediate collision risk if enemy picks that cell.  \nBut enemy might be more likely to go DOWN (toward center/apple) than LEFT (toward my body).  \nIf that\u2019s true, RIGHT is more likely to cause collision.  \nAlso, UP keeps me closer to left-side apples (1,7) and (0,2), away from enemy.  \n\nGiven enemy length 19, they are more constrained; they might avoid moving into my head\u2019s possible moves to avoid tie. But I can\u2019t rely on that.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP because it feels slightly safer given enemy\u2019s probable preference for DOWN, and it aligns with my plan to target left-side apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP, if enemy at (3,2), I can go DOWN or RIGHT next turn. If enemy at (2,3), I can go DOWN or LEFT. Either way, aim to circle toward (1,7) via (1,3) once tail moves. Avoid (5,5) while enemy is near. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\nUP",

It also keeps me on open columns to the west rather than into the crowded eastern corridor.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT into (2,2), then press toward (0,2) to grab that apple quickly.\n- Monitor enemy #0\u2019s move (likely UP to (2,3) or RIGHT to (3,2)); avoid following into tight spots if they cut off routes.\n- After securing (0,2), pivot to stay in open space and aim for the (1,7) apple or move around the enemy wall rather than entering the dense x\u22655 corridor.\n\nLEFT",
