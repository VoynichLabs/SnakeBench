The enemy is far away and poses no immediate head-on threat.\n- After eating at (9,4), avoid hugging the wall too long\u2014use (9,5) then (8,6) or circle back to keep options open and not get trapped by my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

Risk of getting boxed in.\n- RIGHT -> (8,6) is free and keeps space to the right, but no immediate apple; fewer short-term gains than UP.\n- UP -> (7,7) is an apple and opens multiple safe follow-ups: UP to (7,8) (another apple), or RIGHT to the (8,7)/(8,8) cluster. Enemy head is far away so no head-on threat.\n\nI prefer UP: it gets an apple now and keeps multiple escape options into the top-right apple cluster rather than moving into the tighter pocket left of my body.\n\nShort plan: Take (7,7) now, then press into the top-right apples (7,8 -> 8,8/8,7). Avoid doubling back into my own body; if the right-side cluster is blocked later, pivot to sweep down the right edge for (9,0)/(9,1)/(8,0) apples while watching enemy movement on the left.\n\nUP",
