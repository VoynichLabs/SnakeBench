None of those put me straight into death right now \u2013 my own body is empty, the board\u2019s big, and the opponent\u2019s head isn\u2019t moving into my target cell (they\u2019re probably eyeing that sweet (3,3) apple).\n\nBut which direction maximizes future apple grabs while keeping my escape routes open? If I go LEFT I head straight toward the enemy and might get boxed in. DOWN would push me toward the edge at y=0 \u2013 not ideal for long\u2011term flexibility. UP moves me toward the big cluster of apples on the top rows, but I\u2019d still need to snake right later. RIGHT pushes me toward the apple at (7,4) in just two more moves and puts me on a more open part of the map.\n\nSo the smart aggressive play is to slide RIGHT to (7,2). That grabs me closer to a tasty apple, keeps my options wide, and stays far enough from the rival to avoid any accidental head\u2011on KO.\n\nPlan: \u2192 Aim for the (7,4) apple, stay on the right side, keep upward moves available, and watch the rival's next move.\n\nRIGHT",

Head-to-head at the starting line!\n\nMy head at (3,2), enemy head at (6,2). We're on the same y-level, three spaces apart horizontally. Apples are scattered but we're ignoring them for now? Nah, we can use them as bait later. Right now, we need to establish board control.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\n**UP** to (3,3): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But also... that's right next to my current head? Wait, board shows (3,3) is an apple? Actually looking at the board: row 3, column 3 is \"A\"? Let's verify coordinates: y=3, x=3. The board shows at (3,3) there's an \"A\" and an \"A\" at (2,3)? Actually looking carefully: Row 3 (y=3) shows \". . A A . . . . . .\" So x=2 is A, x=3 is A. So (3,3) is indeed an apple. That's a grow move immediately. But is it safe? Enemy is at (6,2). Could he move left to (5,2) then next turn threaten? Not an immediate threat. No body in the way. UP seems safe.\n\n**DOWN** to (3,1): That's an apple too! (3,1) is apple? Row 1: \"A . . A . . . . . .\" Wait, x=3 on row 1? That's (3,1) which is \".\" actually. Let's check: Row 1: x=0 A, x=1 ., x=2 ., x=3 A? No, the board row 1: \"A . . A . . . . . .\" So x=0 A, x=1 ., x=2 ., x=3 A. So (3,1) is apple? Actually coordinate (3,1) is x=3, y=1. Yes, that's an apple. So DOWN gets apple too. Safe? No obstacles.\n\n**LEFT** to (2,2): That's empty. No apple. Safe.\n\n**RIGHT** to (4,2): That's empty. No apple. Safe.\n\nAll four moves seem immediately safe\u2014no walls, no bodies.\n\nBut we need to think about enemy's possible moves. Enemy at (6,2). He could go LEFT to (5,2), DOWN to (6,1), UP to (6,3), RIGHT to (7,2). All safe for him too.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,3) and eat apple, I grow to length 2. That means next turn my tail is at (3,2). That could limit my movement next turn slightly but fine.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,1) and eat apple, same.\n\nBut which puts me in better position to pressure enemy? Going UP puts me at y=3, him at y=2. Going DOWN puts me at y=1. I want to get between him and the center? Or flank him?\n\nActually, long-term plan: I want to expand toward the center and cut off his movement. If I go RIGHT to (4,2), I'm moving toward him horizontally. That's aggressive. Could force a confrontation sooner. But with equal length, head-on collision kills both. I don't want that yet.\n\nGoing LEFT to (2,2) moves away, gives space.\n\nBut eating an apple early gives me length advantage\u2014if I'm longer than him, I can force head-on collision to kill him and survive. So maybe eat ASAP.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN: UP to (3,3) puts me near more apples at (2,3) and (3,4) etc. DOWN to (3,1) puts me near apple at (0,1) and (3,1) itself.\n\nWhich is safer from enemy? Enemy at (6,2). His shortest path to me is 3 horizontal. If I go UP, he'd need 3 left + 1 up = 4 moves to reach me. If I go DOWN, same. So equal.\n\nI'll go UP\u2014get that early growth, set up to control top-left area.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (3,3), my body will be at [(3,3),(3,2)]. Next move avoid going back to (3,2). Possibly go to (2,3) to eat another apple, or (4,3) to move toward center. Watch enemy's move\u2014if he moves left toward me, be ready to evade or prepare to trap.\n\nLet's eat and grow! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

UP moves me straight toward that tasty bite and keeps the whole board in view \u2013 I can still swing left, right, or even up again later. DOWN pushes me toward the edge and shrinks my future options. LEFT heads toward the rival\u2019s neck, which feels a bit too \u201ccozy\u201d for my taste. RIGHT just drifts away from any apple action.  \n\nSo the aggressive, apple\u2011hunting play is to go UP, grab that climb toward (7,4), and stay flexible for the next couple of turns. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5  \n\nUP",

Let's press that advantage.\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n**UP** to (3,4): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? No walls, not our body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\n**DOWN** to (3,2): That's our own body segment! \u274c That's suicide\u2014eliminate.\n\n**LEFT** to (2,3): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Safe? Yes, empty.\n\n**RIGHT** to (4,3): Empty, safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are viable.\n\nNow, think about enemy's possible moves. Enemy at (7,2) could go LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2), UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1). All safe for him.\n\nWe want to grow our length advantage to threaten head-on collisions later. Both UP and LEFT give us an apple\u2014immediate growth to length 3. RIGHT gives no apple.\n\nBut also positioning: If we go UP to (3,4), we're moving toward center-top. If we go LEFT to (2,3), we're moving toward left edge. Which is better for future options?\n\nGoing UP puts us closer to more apples at (3,4) itself, plus (4,9), (2,9) etc. Going LEFT gets apple at (2,3) and maybe (0,1),(0,2) later.\n\nBut we also want to pressure the enemy! He's at (7,2). If we go RIGHT to (4,3), we're moving horizontally toward him but staying one row above. That could start cutting off his upward movement.\n\nHowever, with equal length (he's length 1, we're length 2 after last move? Wait, we already ate an apple last turn\u2014our length is 2 now: head (3,3), body (3,2). So we're length 2, he's length 1. If we eat another apple now, we'll be length 3 vs his 1. That's huge! Then we can force head-on collisions and survive.\n\nSo eating an apple this turn is priority. Between UP and LEFT: which is safer from potential enemy head-on collision?\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (6,3), etc.\u2014he's far. No immediate collision risk.\n\nBut we must consider simultaneous moves: Could he move to (6,2) then next turn threaten? Possibly, but not this turn.\n\nI think UP is slightly better because it keeps us more central. LEFT edges us toward corner\u2014could limit future mobility.\n\nLet's plan next turn: After eating apple at (3,4), our body will be [(3,4),(3,3),(3,2)]. Next turn avoid going back to (3,3). Possible moves from (3,4): UP to (3,5), LEFT to (2,4), RIGHT to (4,4). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.\n\nWe'll watch enemy's movement and start boxing him toward the right wall.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** We'll have length 3 vs his 1. Use that to aggressively cut off his space. Move toward center-right to trap him against wall. Avoid letting him eat apples to catch up. If he moves toward us, consider forcing head-on collision since we're longer.\n\nAlright chat, let's take the apple and dominate! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

I\u2019ve got four safe spots: UP \u2192 (7,4), DOWN \u2192 (7,2), LEFT \u2192 (6,3), RIGHT \u2192 (8,3).  \n\nWhich one pushes me toward the sweet apple stash at (7,4) while keeping my escape routes wide open? UP moves me straight toward that tasty bite and keeps the whole board in view \u2013 I can still swing left, right, or even up again later. DOWN pushes me toward the edge and shrinks my future options. LEFT heads toward the rival\u2019s neck, which feels a bit too \u201ccozy\u201d for my taste. RIGHT just drifts away from any apple action.  \n\nSo the aggressive, apple\u2011hunting play is to go UP, grab that climb toward (7,4), and stay flexible for the next couple of turns. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0fFuture plan:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Eat the (7,4) apple now \u2192 length +1, score spikes.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Target (5,8) and (8,5) next for more content.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep an eye on the rival\u2019s neck at (3,3) to set up a head\u2011on trap.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Stay out of corners and preserve multiple safe follow\u2011ups.  \n\nUP",

We have a 2-apple lead! Time to press this advantage HARD.\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n**UP** to (3,5): Empty. Safe.\n**DOWN** to (3,3): That's our own body! \u274c Suicide \u2014 eliminate.\n**LEFT** to (2,4): Empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT** to (4,4): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are viable.\n\nNow, think about enemy's possible moves from (7,3). He could go UP to (7,4) \u2014 that's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e DOWN to (7,2) \u2014 empty. LEFT to (6,3) \u2014 empty. RIGHT to (8,3) \u2014 empty.\n\nWe want to grow our length advantage AND start boxing him. If he eats that apple at (7,4), he'll grow to length 2 \u2014 we don't want that! We need to cut off his access or force a head-on collision while we're longer.\n\nLet's consider simultaneous moves \u2014 could we collide heads this turn?\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,4), he'd have to go LEFT three spaces to meet us \u2014 impossible.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,4), even farther.\nIf we go UP to (3,5), no collision risk.\n\nSo no immediate head-on risk.\n\nBut think about NEXT turn: We want to limit his space. If we move RIGHT toward him, we start cutting the board. If we move UP, we go toward more apples but give him room.\n\nCheck apples on board: (4,9), (2,3), (0,1), (1,9), (4,0), (0,2), (5,8), (3,1), (2,9), (3,7), (1,7), (7,4), (9,7), (8,5), (0,7). The closest apple to us is (3,7) \u2014 two spaces up. Closest to him is (7,4) \u2014 one space up.\n\nIf he goes UP to (7,4), he eats and grows. We need to either beat him to an apple OR position to trap him.\n\nGoing UP to (3,5) puts us on path to (3,7) apple in two turns. Going LEFT to (2,4) moves us toward (2,3) apple. Going RIGHT to (4,4) moves us toward center but no immediate apple.\n\nBut chat \u2014 AGGRESSION! We have length 3 vs 1. We can afford a head-on collision if we meet him next turn, because we'd survive and he'd die! So let's think about forcing that.\n\nFrom (3,4), if we go RIGHT to (4,4), next turn we could go RIGHT again to (5,4). He's at (7,3). If he moves LEFT to (6,3), then DOWN to (6,2)? Not a collision yet.\n\nHmm, maybe we need to close distance faster. What if we go UP to (3,5) and next turn go RIGHT to (4,5)? That still keeps distance.\n\nActually, the best trap is to push him against the right wall. He's at x=7. If we move to x=4 or x=5, we can start building a vertical wall with our body as we grow, cutting off his leftward escape.\n\nLet's check safe follow-up moves from each option:\n\nFrom (3,5): UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT to (4,5) \u2014 all likely safe next turn.\nFrom (2,4): UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,4), DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 DOWN is an apple! That's good.\nFrom (4,4): UP to (4,5), RIGHT to (5,4), DOWN to (4,3) \u2014 all empty.\n\nAll have good options.\n\nBut we want to dominate the board. Going LEFT edges us toward left wall \u2014 less room to maneuver later. Going UP keeps central. Going RIGHT starts the boxing process.\n\nI think RIGHT is the aggressive play \u2014 start moving toward him, force him to react. If he goes for the apple at (7,4), he'll be at (7,4) next turn, we'll be at (4,4). Then we can continue right to (5,4) and start threatening.\n\nAlso, going RIGHT avoids giving him more apples \u2014 if we go UP or LEFT, he might grab (7,4) and grow.\n\nLet's commit to the boxing strategy! We'll use our length to cut the board.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** We're at (4,4) after this move. Enemy likely at (7,4) if he takes apple. Next turn, consider moving RIGHT to (5,4) to continue pressing. Watch if he moves left toward us \u2014 if he does, we can force head-on collision since we're longer. Avoid moving into his possible path simultaneously. Keep building that wall!\n\nAlright chat, let's close the cage! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

POSITIONS US TO MIRROR HIM VERTICALLY.\n- CONS: WE STAY LENGTH 3, STILL AT A DISADVANTAGE. OUR BODY AT (6,4) BLOCKS OUR DOWN NEXT TURN.\n\nOPTION 3: UP to (6,6)\n- PROS: STAYS CLOSE VERTICALLY, KEEPS PRESSURE. OPENS FUTURE MOVES UP/LEFT/RIGHT.\n- CONS: NO GROWTH, STILL SHORTER.\n\nCHAT, THINK! \ud83e\udde0 EATING THE APPLE AT (5,5) IS HUGE! IT EVENS THE LENGTH! IF WE'RE BOTH LENGTH 4, WE CAN THREATEN HEAD-ON AS A BLUFF OR EVEN FORCE IT IF WE HAVE POSITION! WITHOUT THAT APPLE, WE'RE AT A PERMANENT DISADVANTAGE!\n\nBUT IS IT SAFE? FROM (5,5) NEXT TURN, OUR BODY WILL BE AT (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). ENEMY WILL BE AT EITHER (9,6) OR (9,4). WE'LL BE ONE COLUMN FURTHER LEFT, BUT WE CAN QUICKLY MOVE RIGHT AGAIN.\n\nWHAT'S THE ENEMY'S LIKELY MOVE? HE'S AT (9,5). HE'LL PROBABLY GO UP TO (9,6) TO STAY AWAY FROM OUR ZONE? OR DOWN TO (9,4). EITHER WAY, HE'S STILL TRAPPED ON THE WALL.\n\nIF WE EAT THE APPLE, WE GROW, AND NEXT TURN WE CAN MOVE RIGHT TO (6,5) AGAIN? NO, (6,5) WILL BE OUR BODY! FROM (5,5), OUR SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN WOULD BE UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4) \u2014 OUR BODY! \u274c, LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5) \u2014 OUR BODY! \u274c WAIT! THAT'S A PROBLEM!\n\nHOLD UP! IF WE GO LEFT TO (5,5) AND EAT, OUR TAIL STAYS PUT, SO OUR BODY BECOMES: HEAD (5,5), THEN (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). NEXT TURN FROM (5,5), DOWN (5,4) IS OUR BODY, RIGHT (6,5) IS OUR BODY! THAT LEAVES ONLY UP (5,6) AND LEFT (4,5) AS SAFE! THAT'S A POTENTIAL TRAP! \ud83d\ude31\n\nOPTION 2: RIGHT TO (7,5) \u2014 NEXT TURN FROM (7,5), OUR BODY AT (6,5), (6,4). SAFE MOVES? UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4) \u2014 EMPTY? YES, (7,4) IS ENEMY'S OLD BODY? ENEMY BODY IS (8,5),(8,4),(7,4) \u2014 (7,4) IS ENEMY BODY! \u274c SO DOWN IS DEAD! LEFT (6,5) IS OUR BODY! \u274c RIGHT (8,5) IS ENEMY BODY! \u274c SO ONLY UP (7,6) IS SAFE!

THAT'S 3 SAFE MOVES! MUCH BETTER!\n\nCHAT, THE APPLE IS A TRAP! IT LIMITS OUR FUTURE OPTIONS! WE MUST PRIORITIZE SURVIVAL AND POSITION! UP GIVES US THE MOST FUTURE MOBILITY AND KEEPS US NEAR HIM!\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN: WE'RE AT (6,6). ENEMY AT (9,6) OR (9,4). IF HE'S AT (9,6), WE CAN MOVE RIGHT TO (7,6) TO CUT OFF HIS LEFT ESCAPE. IF HE'S AT (9,4), WE CAN MOVE DOWN? BUT DOWN IS OUR BODY, SO WE'D NEED TO GO LEFT/RIGHT/UP. MAINTAIN VERTICAL ALIGNMENT TO BOX HIM ON THE WALL. AVOID GETTING PINNED OURSELVES. WATCH FOR OUR BODY AT (6,5) \u2014 DON'T GO DOWN! FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER!\n\nUP KEEPS US FLEXIBLE AND AGGRESSIVE!

ALSO BLOCKS HIM FROM MOVING LEFT ALONG THE TOP ROW IF WE LATER MOVE RIGHT.\n- CONS: NOT AS DIRECTLY RESTRICTIVE THIS TURN.\n\nOPTION 3: DOWN to (7,5)\n- PROS: MOVES AWAY FROM HIM, TOWARDS CENTER/BOTTOM. SAFE BUT NOT AGGRESSIVE! CONS: GIVES HIM SPACE TO BREAK OUT. NOT THE PLAY!\n\nCHAT, THINK! \ud83e\udde0 THE ENEMY IS LENGTH 5, STUCK IN THE CORNER! WE NEED TO APPLY PRESSURE BUT ALSO MAINTAIN MOBILITY! GOING RIGHT TO (8,6) IS SUPER AGGRESSIVE BUT COULD TRAP US NEXT TURN WITH ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE IF HE MOVES LEFT TO (8,7)! THAT'S TOO RISKY! WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET STUCK!\n\nGOING UP TO (7,7) KEEPS US SAFE WITH 3 OPTIONS NEXT TURN, AND STILL POSITIONS US TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE! FROM (7,7) NEXT TURN, IF HE'S AT (8,7), WE CAN GO RIGHT TO (8,7) FOR A HEAD-ON? NO, WE'RE STILL LENGTH 3 VS 5, SO WE DIE. BUT WE CAN GO UP TO (7,8) OR LEFT TO (6,7) TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE FROM A SAFE DISTANCE!\n\nBETTER TO PLAY SAFE AND MAINTAIN OPTIONS WHILE KEEPING HIM BOXED! UP IS THE SMART AGGRESSIVE MOVE!

With a higher score we can afford to be bold and *force* a collision later when we grow longer.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Quick plan for the next few turns**  \n- Slip LEFT now to (8,7).  \n- Keep the upper\u2011left quadrant open, grow steadily, and watch for a moment when #1\u2019s head lines up with our extended body at (6,5).  \n- Then swing down\u2011right to trap them and claim those sweet apples!  \n\nLEFT",
