No walls, no bodies\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (7, 7) \n- Opens up future moves LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN - VERSATILE! \u2705\n\n**DOWN:** (8, 5) - Move to (8, 5)\n- Safe move, no collision\n- But moving DOWN pushes me toward the middle of the board where enemy might be\n- Less appealing strategically\n\n**LEFT:** (7, 6) - Move to (7, 6)\n- Wait, there's an APPLE at (7, 6)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- That's IMMEDIATE CONTENT right there!\n- Gets me my first apple and starts the snowball\n- BUT - I need to think: does this leave me boxed in? Let me check...\n- From (7, 6), I can go UP to (7, 7) [another apple!], DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT - STILL VERSATILE!\n\n**RIGHT:** (9, 6) - Move to (9, 6)\n- Safe move, edge of board\n- BUT this is a dead-end direction - limits my options next turn\n- Not ideal when the enemy is still hunting\n\n## THE PLAY CALL \ud83d\udcfa\n\nOkay chat, here's my REAL TALK: \n\nThe enemy is at (5, 4) and we're both starting. This early game is about **positioning and securing apples** while staying MOBILE. If I go LEFT right now, I'm getting that apple at (7, 6) AND I'm positioning myself to potentially chain eat the apple at (7, 7) next turn! That's how you BUILD MOMENTUM! \ud83d\ude80\n\nBy taking that LEFT move, I'm:\n1. \u2705 Getting +1 apple (CONTENT!)\n2. \u2705 Staying away from the enemy's general area\n3. \u2705 Positioning near multiple apples for follow-up plays\n4. \u2705 Keeping my options OPEN - not getting trapped\n\nLong-term strategy: **Control the right/upper side of the board early. Deny enemy resources. Chain apples. Force them into bad positions. THEN WE BOX THEM IN!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe enemy won't expect us to pivot toward that (7, 6) apple this hard this early - that's the MIND GAMES right there! \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\nLEFT",

This is turn ZERO, fresh slate, no bodies, just pure chaos and glory waiting to happen. Time to plot, ambush, and CRUSH him! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udca5 Remember, we gotta box this fool in, make him crash out hard \u2013 but first, survive and get that apple munchin' started! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Who else is feeling that energy? Let's THINK THIS OUT LOUD! \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlright, board's 10x10, all clear skies for now \u2013 no walls boxing us in, no bodies to dodge (yet), and opponent ain't close enough to head-on clash this turn, so ALL FOIL' directions to check: UP to (5,5), DOWN to (5,3), LEFT to (4,4), RIGHT to (6,4). Which one's gonna make YOU streak, chat? \ud83c\udfa4 No move wipes us out immediately \u2013 off-board? Nope, all in bounds. Into our own body? Lol, we ain't grown yet! Into enemy body? Please, rival's got zero, and we ain't crashin' spots. Backwards? What backwards? EZ! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nBut we ain't playing dumb \u2013 Elimination time: ZERO deadly moves here, so all four survive. Now, among the SAFE ones, we HUNT for the gold: moves with tons of follow-ups, get us closer to those juicy apples without painting ourselves into a corner like a loser. Where them apples at, folks? Cluster down bottom-left at (0,1), (0,2), (2,1), (2,2), (6,1), (6,2) \u2013 that's CONTENT heaven, six of 'em begging to be chomped! \ud83c\udf4f And right moves us toward (6,2), a sweet spot. Left pulls us west to more, down dives into that cluster, up sneaks us north where (5,8), (7,5) wait, but why detour when the bottom's LOADED? Competitor move: RIGHT to (6,4) keeps us in wide-open center lanes \u2013 from there, DOWN grabs (6,2) next turn easy-peasy, LEFT swings back or hunts (6,1), UP explores north's scattered drops, RIGHT patrols the top-right edge. MULTIPLE paths, chat! No dead-ends, no squeezes \u2013 we'd be trapping OURSELVES if we cramped in the edges this early. Plus, it shoves us closer to that apple haul without tempting fate with the rival's turf. DOWN's tempting (lots down there, space for maneuvers), but RIGHT sets us up cleaner for looping back and EXPANDING fast. LEFT's solid too, but RIGHT feels like the strike move \u2013 ruthless, positioning to split the board and starve the enemy. \ud83d\udc40 Who's with me on doming this? \n\nHead-on collision risk? Low as hell \u2013 rival's way over at (8,6), they'll probably lunge at their nearby apple at (7,6) if they move LEFT. We dodge that carnage winner style! Our objective? LIVE, EAT apples like a boss (grow big, get points), and keep doors open to lockdown the board. No boxed-in BS here, folks \u2013 this is OUR field to conquer. \ud83c\udf89\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Aggro eat the bottom-left apple cluster ((6,2), (6,1), etc.) to balloon up fast +1,+1,+1 \u2013 rival's nearby drops might grow 'em, but we claim the south side monopoly. Then snake-block the center/middle rows to WALL OFF their expansion south/left, funnel fate into a death pit. Grow bigger, control tighter \u2013 he dies, we feast solo. Finish him! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT",

The SMARTEST play is to keep our advantage by:\n\n1. **Chaining apples** - UP to (7, 7) gets us our second apple back-to-back! That's CONTENT!\n2. **Staying in our zone** - The right/upper side of the board is OUR DOMAIN. We control it!\n3. **Keeping distance** - Enemy is down at (6, 4), we're pushing UP to (7, 7). We're SEPARATING!\n\nIf we go UP, we're setting ourselves up for MORE apples in the next few turns. We can potentially hit (7, 7) then pivot for (5, 8) or (1, 8) soon. We're building a DYNASTY! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLong-term vision for next 3 turns: UP \u2192 secure (7,7), then evaluate if we can chain toward (5, 8) or (1, 8) while keeping the enemy boxed out of the upper zone.

No weak plays, chat \u2013 we're untouchable for now! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udd13\n\nBut we hunger for GLORY, not just livin'. Which keeps doors WIDE open for future raids and apple binges WITHOUT gettin' squeezed? Favor closer hauls with multi-path alleys, dodge rival's sneaky advances. UP to (6,5): Scoots north, away from that south goldmine \u2013 (5,8)'s a detour up there, space for zigzags, but why chase scattered drops when the cluster's PUMPIN'? Rival could block if they LEFT, forcing us into tighter spots like row 6 hub. Nah, too far from food frenzy. LEFT to (5,4): West swing, closer to (5,8) after one more, and that row 4 lane's wide-open for loops back east \u2013 solid bailout options, no dead ends, but still a bit west of the main apple party at south. Rival munchin' (7,7) UP, we'd be positionin' to flank later. DOWN to (6,3): Oh snap, chat \u2013 dives RIGHT into the cluster heart! Hits (6,2) in ONE more move, then (6,1)'s next-door neighbor for chaining eats. Row 3's free and open for side-swings LEFT/RIGHT/UP, tons of escape routes \u2013 not crampin' ourselves in corners. Plus, get BIG FAST, +1 apple quick, rival's gonna HATE the gap closin'. Head-on? Tiny risk if opp ventures south, but they seem north-bound. Epp RIGHT to (7,4): Central throne, yeah? Keeps multiple lanes like last turn planned \u2013 LEFT loops back fast, DOWN grabs south apples easy, UP probes north (7,5) apple orb waitin'. No tight squeezes, and if rival LEFT to (6,6), we can counter-slither without collision. But it's a two-move detour for eats compared to DOWN's direct plunge \u2013 why wait when we can munch sooner and GROW NOW? \ud83d\udc7f\ud83c\udf4f We're in early game, eat to overpower \u2013 DOWN's the AGGRESSIVE strike, closin' apples for score surge, future algos wide open. Opp might shadow, but we SLAY THEM if they bite our wake, lives on. DOWN wins: fast food, open board, crush setup. Who's votin' YES on this ambush play? \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Eat that south cluster HARD ((6,2) THEN (6,1), chain 'em if poss) to hit +2 apples quick, balloon length for throat-clamp power. Loop back east via row 3/4 lanes to block opp's southern raids, wall off left access to their space, force 'em north into thinner apples. Starve the punk #0, make 'em desperate for a crash. Dominate west-middle eventually, monopoly on clusters \u2013 they die, we solo-win this throne. No mercy! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

They're probably gonna move toward one of those apples on the left side like (2, 2) or (2, 1).\n\n**UP is the PLAY** because:\n1. **Apple chain incoming!** (7, 9) is RIGHT THERE - we can grab it next turn! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. **Board control** - we're pushing into the NORTH territory where there's less competition!\n3. **Keep options open** - from (8, 8) we can still move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.

If opp dives south, use new length to cut tails/off dead-ends, force em north into thin north spots/congestion. Hit mid-apples ((5,8)/(6,1)? Wait (5,8)/(7,5) east) for monopoly edge, grow to 5-6 snakes before congestion kills, trap/slam 'em into walls. No mercy, box and end! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc4a**\n\nDOWN",

Closer munchies = FASTER growth to CLIP their tails and force dead-ends around this chump. DOWN to (6,0): Dips low, frees zero apples immediately (row 0? BARREN, chat \u2013 why venture there for scraps?), and funnels into wall jams south, perfect FOR opp passive-aggressives if they slant down. Options clog up quick, stalls the raid \u2013 BORING move, we ain't about that graveyard energy.

Unlocks bottom-row MONOPOLY ((1,1) left hook or (0,1) side raid next), tons of combos to loop north/cut opp south dives with.new length \u2013 THIS is the SKILL PUNCH, chat! Eats CLOSE, keeps MULTI-paths open (RIGHT flips, DOWN thin lanes if needed), avoids tight boxes, and TURN opp's south dreams into NIGHTMARES by owning the low turf first. Opp's head way north, probs not slamming us RIGHT now \u2013 why zig away when LEFT charges best? VIBING for that apple avalanche? \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF: Lock in LEFT to devour (2,1) ASAP (grow to 4, then bend LEFT to (1,1) or swing UP x=5 loops), dominate bottom row against opp south flanks \u2013 use fresh length to tail-block/chase 'em into north congestions or walls.

Eats CLOSE, grows FAST to 4+ bodies, turns opp dives into DEAD-END nightmares. Opp's head stuck north \u2013 why detour UP/DOWN when LEFT CHARGES supremacy? Time to avalanche those apples and WATCH 'em squirm? \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF: Crush LEFT-chain toward (2,1) devour (grow to 4), THEN swift LEFT bend to (1,1) for extra snack/growth. Dominate bottom row (0-1 y-lanes) for monopoly, tail-block opp south flanks \u2013 use bulked-up frame (aim 5-7 bodies) to chase/Box 'em north into walls/apple-jams.

They're TRYING to contest? NAH, we're about to DOMINATE this board in a snake-eats-world kinda way, munch those apples FAST, and BOX that fool into oblivion! Who's hyped to WATCH 'em crash out??? LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nSafety CHECK \u2013 ain't no time for L's on this LIVE beast! UP to (4,2)?

EXPLODES multi-paths wide (UP flips north escapes, DOWN south flips), NO tight squeezes, and OWNS the bottom monopoly to SPITE opp's southern jukes. Eats CLOSE, grows RAPID (we talkin' 5-7 body beast mode fast), turns opp advances into FATAL dead-ends against walls or jams. Opp's head glued north \u2013 why waste UP/DOWN detours when LEFT BLASTS 'em to hell?

Moving UP is:\n\n1. **TAKES THE LEAD 5-4!** \ud83d\udcc8 We go from tied to CHAMPION STATUS!\n2. **ZERO THREATS** - Enemy is nowhere NEAR us, they're chilling down at (1, 1)!\n3. **CLEAN EXECUTION** - No collisions, no throws, just PURE DOMINANCE!\n4. **BOARD CONTROL** - We're expanding in the safe upper zone while they're trapped down low!\n\n## NEXT MOVES PLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**After Turn 9:** We'll be at (5, 9) with 5 apples. From there, we got OPTIONS:\n- (4, 5) and (1, 5) are available apples in the mid-zone\n- We can navigate safely while keeping distance from opponent\n- Stay aggressive, keep the PRESSURE on, don't let them breathe!\n- Watch for positioning opportunities to CORNER them later in the game!\n\nThis is TEXTBOOK execution, chat! We identify the opening, we strike HARD, we take the lead, and we keep it MOVING! No hesitation! No mercy! Just APPETITE! \n\nLET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

We're up 5-4 after that CLUTCH apple grab last turn, and now we're in the driver's seat! But this is where we gotta stay FOCUSED because one mistake and we're getting sent to the lobby! Let's analyze this frame by frame!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (5, 9) \u2705 Just ate that apple!\n- Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)]\n- Apples: 5 - WE'RE LEADING! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Enemy Snake (#1):**\n- Head: (1, 1)\n- Body: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Apples: 5 - STILL TIED ON APPLES BUT WE'RE UP IN POINTS!\n\n## DIRECTION CHECK - SURGICAL ANALYSIS \ud83e\uddec\n\nLet me break down our OPTIONS:\n\n**UP:** (5, 10)\n- OFF THE BOARD! That's an INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- We're already at the TOP (y=9), can't go higher!\n- THROW ALERT! Don't even THINK about it!\n\n**DOWN:** (5, 8)\n- Target cell: (5, 8)\n- That's where our BODY is! Our body is [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)]\n- (5, 8) is literally the FIRST segment right behind our head!\n- Moving DOWN = moving INTO our own body = INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- This is a BACKWARD move! BIG THROW! \u274c\n\n**LEFT:** (4, 9)\n- Target cell: (4, 9)\n- Any apples there? NEGATIVE! \u274c\n- Our body segments: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)] - none at (4, 9)! \u2705\n- Enemy threat? (1, 1) with body extending right along y=1 - MILES AWAY at the bottom! \u2705\n- Off board? Nope, (4, 9) is VALID! \u2705\n- This move KEEPS US ALIVE and gives us options! \u2705\n- However, it moves us AWAY from the remaining apples. Limited apple proximity. \ud83e\udd14\n\n**RIGHT:** (6, 9)\n- Target cell: (6, 9)\n- Any apples there? NEGATIVE! \u274c\n- Our body segments: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)] \n- WAIT! (6, 9) is in our body! That's a segment!\n- Moving RIGHT = moving INTO our own body = INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- ANOTHER THROW! \u274c\n\n## THE SITUATION \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're in a TIGHT SPOT right now! We just grew from eating that apple and now our body is CRAMPING our options! Look at our current shape:\n- Head at (5, 9)\n- Body wrapping around: (5, 8) directly below, then (6, 8), then (6, 9) to the right!\n\nWe basically have TWO directions that DON'T kill us immediately:\n1. **LEFT** to (4, 9) - moves us away from danger\n2. We can't go UP (off board), DOWN (own body), or RIGHT (own body)!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION \ud83e\udde0\n\nWe're FORCED to move LEFT because it's literally the only safe play! But here's the LONG GAME thinking:\n\nFrom (4, 9), we can navigate back toward the apple clusters in the middle of the board. The apples at (2, 7), (1, 8), and (4, 7) are calling our name! We need to start positioning ourselves to control the CENTER while keeping the opponent boxed down at the bottom.\n\n## NEXT TURNS PLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**After Turn 10:** We'll be at (4, 9) with 5 apples. From there:\n- (1, 8) is ONE CELL AWAY (just 3 moves if we navigate properly)!\n- (2, 7) and (4, 7) form a cluster we can abuse!\n- Keep expanding upward and MAINTAIN our lead!\n- Watch for opportunities to corner opponent when they eventually move up the board!\n\nThis is CHESS not CHECKERS, chat! We're thinking THREE MOVES AHEAD! The BOXIN' STRATEGY starts NOW! \n\nLET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

We're DOWN by ONE now! This is where the CLUTCH gameplay matters! Time to flip the script and get AGGRESSIVE!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE BREAKDOWN \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 9) \u2705 Perfect positioning from last turn!\n- Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9)]\n- Apples: 5 - WE GOTTA CATCH UP! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Enemy Snake (#1):**\n- Head: (0, 2) - Still down at the bottom\n- Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Apples: 6 - They're AHEAD but still trapped down south! \n\n## DIRECTION ANALYSIS - SURGICAL PRECISION \ud83e\uddec\n\nLet me run through our OPTIONS:\n\n**UP:** (4, 10)\n- OFF THE BOARD! That's an INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- We're at y=9 (top row basically), can't go higher!\n\n**DOWN:** (4, 8)\n- Target cell: (4, 8)\n- Any body segments there? Our body is [(5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9)] - NONE at (4, 8)! \u2705\n- Opponent threat? Their head is at (0, 2), body extends right along y=1 - SAFE! \u2705\n- Off board? Nope, VALID! \u2705\n- This keeps us alive and moves us DOWN! \u2705\n\n**LEFT:** (3, 9)\n- Target cell: (3, 9)\n- Any body segments there? NEGATIVE! \u2705\n- Opponent threat? SAFE! \u2705\n- Off board? VALID! \u2705\n- Moves us LEFT along the top!\n\n**RIGHT:** (5, 9)\n- Target cell: (5, 9)\n- WAIT! That's literally our FIRST body segment!\n- Moving RIGHT = moving INTO our own body = INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- NO GO! \u274c\n\n## THE STRATEGIC DECISION \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we have THREE safe moves: UP (nope, off board), DOWN, or LEFT!\n\nBut HERE'S the GAME SENSE moment! \ud83d\udc40 Look at those apples:\n- **(1, 8)** - that's just ONE cell away from our position! PERFECT!\n- **(2, 7)** - ALSO in the cluster!\n- **(4, 7)** - RIGHT below us!\n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (4, 8), we're now positioned to either:\n1. Go LEFT next turn to (3, 8), then to (2, 8), then grab (1, 8) - CONTENT!\n2. Go LEFT to chase (2, 7) and (4, 7)!\n\nThis move keeps us on the ATTACK and closes the gap with opponent! We're DOWN by one apple - we need to START FARMING these clusters NOW before they go stale!\n\nMoving DOWN also keeps our future options WIDE OPEN! We won't get boxed in! We can pivot left, down, or even back up if needed!\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS:** We're going to PILLAGE that apple cluster in the left-center zone:\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (4, 8)\n- Turn 12: LEFT toward (3, 8) \n- Turn 13: Continue LEFT to start harvesting (1, 8), (2, 7), etc.\n\nThis puts us in CONTROL of the board's most valuable real estate! Meanwhile, opponent is stuck at the bottom with limited mobility! We're setting up the BOX-IN for LATER!\n\nThe GAMEPLAN: FARM APPLES NOW, BOX OPPONENT LATER! Let's GO!\n\nDOWN",

We made that move DOWN last turn and now we're positioned to FARM this apple cluster HARD! Let's break down what's happening!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 8) \u2705 RIGHT where we planned!\n- Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)]\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Apples: 5\n\n**Enemy Snake (#1):**\n- Head: (0, 3) - They moved UP one cell from (0, 2)!\n- Body: [(0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Apples: 6 - Still UP by one, but NOT FOR LONG! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## AVAILABLE MOVES CHECK - NO MISTAKES! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP:** (4, 9)\n- That's our FIRST body segment RIGHT THERE!\n- Moving UP into (4, 9) = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- VETOED immediately!\n\n**DOWN:** (4, 7)\n- Target: (4, 7)\n- ANY of our body there? [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)] - NEGATIVE! \u2705\n- Opponent body threat? They're way over at x=0-4, y=1-3, head at (0, 3) - SAFE! \u2705\n- Off board? (4, 7) is VALID! \u2705\n- BONUS: There's an APPLE at (4, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e FREE APPLE! We'd GROW and tie the score!\n- This move is CLUTCH!\n\n**LEFT:** (3, 8)\n- Target: (3, 8)\n- Body segments there? NEGATIVE! \u2705\n- Opponent threat? SAFE ZONE! \u2705\n- Off board? VALID! \u2705\n- No apple here, but keeps us mobile!\n\n**RIGHT:** (5, 8)\n- Target: (5, 8)\n- WAIT! That's our THIRD body segment!\n- Moving RIGHT into (5, 8) = HITTING OURSELVES = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- VETOED!\n\n## THE STRATEGIC DECISION \ud83e\udde0\n\nChat, THIS IS THE MOMENT! We have DOWN and LEFT available!\n\n**DOWN to (4, 7)** is ABSOLUTELY the move here because:\n1. \u2705 There's a LITERAL APPLE at (4, 7) - we EAT it and tie the score 6-6!\n2. \u2705 After eating, we grow to length 7, giving us MORE board control!\n3. \u2705 We maintain FULL mobility - after eating at (4, 7), we can still go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN!\n4. \u2705 We're getting AGGRESSIVE and closing the apple gap RIGHT NOW!\n5. \u2705 Opponent is still bottled up at the left side - they can't contest this apple!\n\nThis isn't even a question - we're FARMING this apple and taking back the lead! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**TURNS 12-15 ROADMAP:**\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (4, 7) - GRAB THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (Score ties 6-6)\n- Turn 13: LEFT to (3, 7) - Keep hunting the cluster!\n- Turn 14: LEFT to (2, 7) - ANOTHER APPLE! Keep growing! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 15: UP to (2, 8) - Close to (1, 8)!\n\nWe're about to DOMINATE this left-center zone! Meanwhile, opponent is TRAPPED in the bottom-left corner with limited apple access! This is where we BUILD THE LEAD and start setting up that BOX-IN for the endgame! \n\nWe're taking control of the board CONTENT right now, chat! Let's GO!\n\nDOWN",

Now we're sitting at 7-7, but we're in the DRIVER'S SEAT with full board control! Enemy snake #1 is still bottled up on the left side like they're in prison! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT BOARD REALITY CHECK \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (2, 7) \u2705 We GRABBED that apple!\n- Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Enemy Snake (#1):**\n- Head: (0, 6) - They moved UP from (0, 5)\n- Body: [(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)]\n- Length: 7 segments (they also grew!)\n- Apples: 7 \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWait wait wait... CHAT, they tied us up! They got an apple too! No worries though - we still control the center and right side of this map! They're STILL trapped on the left edge! \ud83c\udfac\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT & MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP:** (2, 8)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8)] - No hit at (2, 8)! \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy collision? Head at (0, 6) won't reach (2, 8)! \u2705\n- Apple nearby? (1, 8) is ONE CELL to the LEFT from (2, 8)! Next turn we chain it! \ud83c\udfaf\n- VERDICT: SAFE & STRATEGIC!\n\n**DOWN:** (2, 6)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? NONE \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy threat? SAFE - (0, 6) won't collide \u2705\n- Apple nearby? (2, 5) is ONE CELL below! Could grab next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- VERDICT: SAFE but we lose momentum on the (1, 8) chain!\n\n**LEFT:** (1, 7)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? ZERO \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy threat? (0, 6) head is ONE CELL AWAY! If they move LEFT next turn, we could meet at (1, 6) - but that's next turn's problem! \u2705\n- Apple nearby? NO direct apple at (1, 7)\n- VERDICT: Safe but sideways movement!\n\n**RIGHT:** (3, 7)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? (3, 7) is literally our FIRST body segment RIGHT NOW!\n- VERDICT: INSTANT DEATH \u274c VETO'D!\n\n## THE PLAY \ud83e\udde0\n\nChat, we're going **UP to (2, 8)**! Here's why:\n\n1. \u2705 **CHAIN THOSE APPLES** - From (2, 8) we can go LEFT next turn to grab (1, 8) for apple #8!\n2. \u2705 **MAINTAIN BOARD CONTROL** - We're moving up the center-left corridor where enemy can't easily contest!\n3. \u2705 **OPEN FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (2, 8) we have UP, DOWN, and LEFT all available for positioning!\n4. \u2705 **STAY AHEAD** - Next turn we'll be 8-7 and BREAKING THIS TIE!\n5. \u2705 **AVOID CONGESTION** - Going down keeps us near enemy corridor; going up lets us work the upper apple cluster!\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 15 (NOW):** UP to (2, 8) - Position ourselves perfectly!\n**Turn 16:** LEFT to (1, 8) - GRAB APPLE #8! We're 8-7! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 17:** We can pivot DOWN or RIGHT to farm more apples while building pressure on enemy's escape routes! That's when the BOXING BEGINS!\n\nEnemy is STILL stuck in their left corridor with limited options! We're about to open up a 2-apple lead and DOMINATE the midgame! This is PEAK gameplay, chat! They can't touch us right now! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nUP",

Let me break down what just happened and where we're going next!\n\n## BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (2, 8) \u2705 We're positioned PERFECTLY up here!\n- Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7 \ud83c\udf4e Still tied but we're about to BREAK THIS!\n\n**Enemy Snake (#1):**\n- Head: (1, 6) - They moved UP from (0, 6)\n- Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7 \ud83c\udf4e\n\nChat, they're still BOTTLED UP on the left side! Their head is at (1, 6) and they're practically in a cage! Meanwhile we control the center and upper right! This is CHESS not checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT FOR THIS TURN \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLet me analyze every direction from (2, 8):\n\n**LEFT:** (1, 8)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)] - Nothing at (1, 8)! \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy threat? Head at (1, 6) is TWO cells away - safe! \u2705\n- **APPLE AT (1, 8)?!** YES!!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e THIS IS THE PLAY!\n- VERDICT: **GRAB APPLE #8 + MAINTAIN CONTROL!** \ud83d\ude80\n\n**RIGHT:** (3, 8)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? NONE \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy threat? Safe \u2705\n- Apple nearby? (4, 5) down below but not adjacent\n- VERDICT: Safe but we MISS the free apple at (1, 8)! Why would we do that?!\n\n**UP:** (2, 9)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? NONE \u2705\n- Backward? NO \u2705\n- Enemy threat? Safe \u2705\n- Apple nearby? NO apple at (2, 9)\n- VERDICT: Safe but sideways when we have a FREE APPLE calling us!\n\n**DOWN:** (2, 7)\n- Board valid? YES \u2705\n- Body collision? (2, 7) is literally our FIRST body segment!\n- VERDICT: **INSTANT DEATH** \u274c VETO'D!\n\n## THE CALL \ud83c\udfa4\n\nChat, this is EASY MONEY! We're going **LEFT to (1, 8)**! Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. \u2705 **GRAB APPLE #8** - We go 8-7 and TAKE THE LEAD for the first time! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. \u2705 **ZERO RISK** - Enemy head at (1, 6) can't reach us! We're safe!\n3. \u2705 **KEEP MOMENTUM** - This is EXACTLY what we planned last turn!\n4. \u2705 **BOARD CONTROL** - We're expanding our territory upwards while enemy is stuck in their left prison!\n5. \u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (1, 8) we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT - all options still available!\n\n## NEXT TURNS GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 16 (NOW):** LEFT to (1, 8) - GRAB APPLE #8! We're 8-7 BABY! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 17:** We pivot - either UP toward (1, 9) or DOWN to farm the (2, 5) apple cluster or RIGHT to keep working mid-board! Options WIDE OPEN!\n**Turn 18+:** Enemy is STILL trapped on the left edge! We use our 1-apple lead to dictate pace and box them into TIGHTER and TIGHTER corridors! Eventually they CRASH OUT trying to escape! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is peak gameplay chat! We're playing 4D chess while they're playing checkers! No cap! \n\nLEFT",

We're farming territory!\n3. \u2705 **KEEP MOBILITY** - We're NOT trapping ourselves in corners like amateurs!\n4. \u2705 **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING** - We're moving DOWN toward the center-left where apples cluster!\n5. \u2705 **CHESS MOVE** - Enemy is stuck on the LEFT edge, we're controlling the CENTER and UPPER AREAS!\n\n## NEXT TURNS GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 17 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 7) - Stay MOBILE and position for the apple cluster at (2, 6) and (2, 5)! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Turn 18:** We read the board and either:\n- Keep going DOWN to (1, 6) if safe, or\n- Pivot RIGHT to grab apples in the (2, 5)-(4, 5) zone!\n\n**Turn 19+:** We're building MOMENTUM! Enemy is BOTTLED UP on the left side. We use our superior board control to dictate the pace, force them into tight corridors, and make them CRASH OUT when they panic! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is PEAK GAMEPLAY chat!

Next turn we can pivot RIGHT and GRAB IT! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. \u2705 **MOMENTUM BUILD** - We're positioning ourselves to farm the (2, 5)-(4, 5) apple cluster and close the gap!\n4. \u2705 **BOARD CONTROL** - Enemy is trapped in the left corridor. We own the center-upper zone!\n5. \u2705 **AGGRESSIVE PLAY** - We're hunting, not hiding!
