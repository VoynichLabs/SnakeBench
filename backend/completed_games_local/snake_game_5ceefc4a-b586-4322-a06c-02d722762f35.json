Moving DOWN would immediately collect it!\n- Apple (3, 2) is at (3, 2) - moving LEFT would immediately collect it!\n- Both DOWN and LEFT would give me an immediate apple.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (8, 3) - to my right and above me.\n\n**Move analysis:**\n- UP (4, 3): Moves me away from all apples, not optimal.\n- DOWN (4, 1): **Immediately collects apple (4, 1)** - this is a guaranteed point!\n- LEFT (3, 2): **Immediately collects apple (3, 2)** - this is also a guaranteed point!\n- RIGHT (5, 2): Moves me toward enemy snake #0's territory - potentially risky.\n\n**Decision factors:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT would immediately collect an apple. I need to consider:\n- After collecting an apple, I will grow by 1 segment\n- The position I'll be in after growing\n- Future apple opportunities\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 1):\n- I collect apple (4, 1)\n- My new body will extend to (4, 2) and (4, 3)\n- This positions me well for the left-side cluster of apples (0, 6) and (0, 7)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2):\n- I collect apple (3, 2)\n- My new body will extend to (4, 2) and (4, 3)\n- This also positions me well for the left-side cluster of apples\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of immediate benefit and future positioning.
