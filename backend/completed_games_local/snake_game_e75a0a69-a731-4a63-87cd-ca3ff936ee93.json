Wait recalc: (8,7) to (7,4) = |1|+|3|=4).  \n\nSo both LEFT and DOWN reduce distance to the nearest apple equally? Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (8,8) to (7,4): dist=5  \nLEFT to (7,8): to (7,4): dist=4  \nDOWN to (8,7): to (7,4): dist=4  \nSo same.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (8,8):  \n- UP to (8,9): borders top wall (y=9), reduces future upward moves.  \n- RIGHT to (9,8): borders right wall (x=9), reduces future right moves.  \n- LEFT to (7,8): more central, more options next turn.  \n- DOWN to (8,7): more central, more options next turn.  \n\nLEFT or DOWN seem best for keeping options open.  \n\n**Choosing between LEFT and DOWN:**  \nLEFT to (7,8) \u2192 next turn could go DOWN toward apple (7,4) or continue left toward other apples.  \nDOWN to (8,7) \u2192 next turn could go LEFT toward (7,4).  \n\nBut apple at (7,4) is at y=4, x=7. From (7,8), need to go DOWN 4 steps. From (8,7), need to go LEFT 1 and DOWN 3. Slightly more flexible from (8,7) because x=8 allows left or right.  \n\nActually, (7,8) also allows left/right/down, but not up (wall at y=9 irrelevant). Both fine.  \n\nLet\u2019s check if any move leads to a possible collision next turn with enemy\u2019s potential move. Enemy at (9,2) likely will move toward apples (9,1) DOWN or (7,4) LEFT/DOWN. Not near me.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **LEFT** to move toward the horizontal cluster of apples on left side long-term.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,8), consider moving DOWN toward (7,4), but also watch enemy snake movement. Keep central flexibility.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

RIGHT to (9,1) is into its own body and would kill it.

Moving DOWN eats it immediately, gaining a point and growing to length 2. Other moves increase distance to this apple or delay eating.\n\n**Future safety:**  \nMoving DOWN to (7,4) consumes the apple, leaving our body at (7,5). Next turn, from (7,4), we will have three safe moves (DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4)) and one unsafe move (UP into our body). This provides sufficient flexibility. Enemy is far away and unlikely to threaten in the next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating the apple at (7,4), target the next closest apple\u2014likely (4,5) or (4,7). From (7,4), consider moving LEFT to (6,4) to approach (4,5). Monitor enemy's new position and avoid potential head-on collisions.

Moving LEFT to (6,4) gets us closer to (6,2) (now distance 2), but moving DOWN to (7,3) also gets closer (distance |7-6|+|3-2|=1+1=2).  \nRIGHT to (8,4) increases distance to most apples.\n\n**Future safety and options:**  \nFrom (7,3): possible next moves: UP (back into our body at (7,4)? Wait, after moving DOWN, our head will be at (7,3), body at [(7,4),(7,5)]). Next turn, UP to (7,4) is occupied by our own body \u2192 unsafe. So from (7,3), safe moves would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

UP to (6,5) empty, DOWN to (6,3) empty, LEFT to (5,4) empty, RIGHT to (7,4) occupied by our body \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves again.  \n\nFrom (8,4): body at [(7,4),(7,5)]. Next turn from (8,4): UP, DOWN, LEFT (to (7,4) occupied), RIGHT safe? LEFT unsafe, RIGHT safe, UP safe, DOWN safe \u2192 3 safe moves also.  \n\nAll three safe moves give similar flexibility next turn.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy likely moves LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0). It might aim for apple at (6,2) eventually. If enemy goes LEFT to (7,0), it\u2019s still far from us. If RIGHT to (9,0), still far.  \n\nWe should avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily, but currently enemy far away.\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT reduce distance to nearest apple (6,2) equally (Manhattan distance 2 after either move).  \nBut DOWN keeps us in column 7, LEFT moves to column 6, which is closer to apples (4,5) and (4,7) as well.  \nLEFT seems slightly better for multi-apple pathing.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (6,4), next turn consider moving DOWN to (6,3) to approach apple (6,2), or LEFT further to (5,4) to approach (4,5)/(4,7). Monitor enemy\u2019s new head position to avoid head-on collisions. Keep length advantage over enemy (both length 2 now).  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

From (6,2), moving LEFT to (5,2) is a step in that direction. However, always check enemy's new position and possible moves to avoid head-on collisions. Keep assessing safe paths and maintain multiple exit options.\n\nDOWN",

None overlap with our safe destinations ((6,1), (5,2), (7,2)), so no immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (4,5) (Manhattan distance 5). Moving LEFT to (5,2) reduces distance to (4,5) to 4 and also brings us closer to (2,5) and (4,7). Moving DOWN or RIGHT increases distances to most apples.\n\n**Future safety:**  \nAfter moving LEFT (no apple eaten), new body: head at (5,2), body at [(6,2), (6,3)]. From (5,2), next turn's safe moves will be UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2) \u2014 three options, maintaining good maneuverability. Moving DOWN or RIGHT also yields three safe options next turn, but LEFT additionally progresses toward apples while distancing from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nContinue toward the apple cluster at (4,5) and (2,5). From (5,2), consider moving UP or LEFT next turn to approach (4,5) while monitoring enemy movements. Avoid moving toward the enemy on the right side unless necessary. Maintain multiple escape routes and prioritize safe apple consumption to extend our lead (2 apples vs. 1).\n\nLEFT",

Let's check: after moving UP, my body will be [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]? Wait, careful:  \nCurrent: head (4, 3), body [(4, 2), (5, 2)].  \nIf I move UP to (4, 4): new head (4, 4), new body = [old head (4, 3), then (4, 2), then (5, 2)].  \nSo body cells: (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2).  \nThus DOWN from (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) is occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2014 empty.\nSo safe next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).\n\n**LEFT to (3, 3):**\nNew body: [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]? Wait, correction:  \nMove LEFT to (3, 3), new body = [old head (4, 3), then (4, 2), then (5, 2)] \u2192 body cells: (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2).  \nNext turn from (3, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 4) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2014 my body \u2192 unsafe.\nSo safe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 safe moves).\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 3):**\nNew body: [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)] \u2192 body cells: (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2).  \nNext turn from (5, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (5, 4) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 2) \u2014 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2014 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2014 empty.\nSo safe next moves: UP, RIGHT (2 safe moves).\n\nRIGHT has fewer safe options next turn \u2192 less desirable.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy's possible apple targeting:**\nEnemy head at (7, 3). Closest apple is (4, 5) distance = 3 + 2 = 5, or (2, 5) distance = 5 + 2 = 7.  \nEnemy might move toward (4, 5) via UP then LEFT over two turns. If I move UP now, I could get to (4, 5) in 2 turns (UP to (4, 4), then UP to (4, 5)). Enemy would need at least 2 turns as well if it goes UP then LEFT twice. But enemy could also move LEFT first to (6, 3), then UP to (6, 4), then LEFT to (5, 4), then UP to (5, 5), then LEFT to (4, 5) \u2014 longer route. So I have a good chance to reach (4, 5) first.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan for next turns:**\nFrom (4, 4) next turn, if apple (4, 5) still there, go UP if safe (check enemy position). If enemy blocks, maybe go LEFT toward (2, 5) instead. Keep an eye on enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions since I'm longer (3 vs 2) so I'd win a head-on collision, but still risky if enemy grows before then.\n\n---\n\nBest move: **UP** (closest to apple, good future options).\n\nUP",

RIGHT (7,5) is its body, unsafe.\nOur destinations: (4,7), (3,6), (5,6). No overlap with enemy's possible destinations, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Apple proximity\nClosest apple is (4,7) at distance 1 (directly UP).

RIGHT moves away from closest apples.\n\nStep 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move\n- UP: After eating, head at (4,7). Next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is own body). So 3 options.\n- LEFT: Head at (3,6). Next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT is own body). So 3 options.\n- RIGHT: Head at (5,6). Next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is own body). So 3 options.\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nStep 6 \u2013 Enemy threat\nEnemy is at (6,5), distance 3 from (4,7). Not an immediate threat. Even if enemy moves towards us, we have a length advantage (4 vs 2) and apple lead (3 vs 1). Head-on collision would give us win if both die, but we prefer to stay alive.\n\nStep 7 \u2013 Decision\nUP gives an immediate apple, increases score to 4, and keeps future options open. It is the most advantageous move.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nAfter moving UP and eating the apple at (4,7), we will be at (4,7) with body extending down to (4,3). Consider moving LEFT or RIGHT to start moving away from the vertical line and towards other apples, especially (2,5). Avoid moving UP into the top edge unless safe.

Then evaluate moves toward (2,2) or (0,8) while monitoring enemy movement. Maintain safe distance and avoid traps.\n\nLEFT",

Check possible moves from (3,1):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 death \u2192 **not safe**.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 empty, on board \u2192 seems safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 empty, on board \u2192 seems safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 empty, on board \u2192 seems safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy head at (8,1). Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 their own body segment \u2192 not safe for them.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 empty, safe for them.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 empty, safe for them.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 empty, safe for them.  \n\nThey will avoid UP, so they will choose DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Possible collisions:**  \nMy DOWN to (3,0): enemy moving DOWN to (8,0) \u2192 far apart, no collision.  \nMy LEFT to (2,1): enemy moving LEFT to (7,1) \u2192 far apart, no collision.  \nMy RIGHT to (4,1): enemy moving LEFT to (7,1) \u2192 far apart, no collision.  \n\nNo head-on collision possible this turn because we are far apart.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (3,0):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (3,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 empty (current head position becomes empty after move).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,0) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board (y=-1) \u2192 not safe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if DOWN now.\n\n**LEFT to (2,1):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (2,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 my own body (third segment) \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,1):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (4,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 empty.  \nAll 4 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (3,3) at distance |3-3|+|1-3| = 2 steps.  \n- (0,0) at distance 4 steps.  \n- (0,8) far.  \n- (9,8) far.  \n- (7,9) far.  \n\n(3,3) is close but blocked by my own body at (3,2) and (2,3) above/around it.  \nFrom (3,1), to reach (3,3) I'd need to go around because UP is blocked.  \nFrom LEFT (2,1), could go UP to (2,2)?? That's my body, so no.  \nFrom RIGHT (4,1), could go UP to (4,2), then LEFT to (3,2)?? That's body. So still tricky.  \n\nActually, (3,3) is adjacent to my body at (2,3) and (3,2), so eating it might trap me unless I plan path carefully.  \n\nBetter: (0,0) is safe to approach: from (3,0) after moving DOWN, I can go LEFT along bottom row toward (0,0).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Avoiding dead ends:**  \nMoving RIGHT to (4,1) gives most options next turn.  \nMoving DOWN to (3,0) also good, heading toward apple (0,0).  \nMoving LEFT to (2,1) puts me closer to my long body trail along x=2, which might reduce options later.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is at (8,1), length 3, likely going for apple at (9,8) or (7,9) by moving up later. Not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT gives maximum future flexibility (4 safe moves next turn), while also moving toward center/open space.  \nDOWN also safe and heads toward (0,0) apple but reduces next turn's moves to 3.  \n\nGiven my length advantage (7 vs 3), survival and flexibility matter most. I'll choose RIGHT for now to keep options open, then possibly aim for (0,0) later or (7,9) if enemy moves away.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (4,1), next turn consider moving UP toward (7,9) apple if enemy not threatening, or continue RIGHT/DOWN to stay safe and approach apples while avoiding trapping myself. Monitor enemy movement; if they eat apple and grow, still keep distance. Prioritize keeping at least 2 escape routes.  \n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(8,1), (8,2)]  \nApples: (0,8), (0,0), (9,8), (7,9), (3,3)\n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate safe moves from (4,1):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,2): empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,0): empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,1): my own body segment \u2192 **not safe**.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,1): empty, safe.\n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (8,0):**\n\nEnemy safe moves: UP to (8,1) (own body? no, wait: their body is [(8,1), (8,2)], so (8,1) is their second segment \u2192 not safe). Actually, (8,1) is occupied by their body, so UP is not safe for them.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board (y=-1) \u2192 not safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,0): empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,0): empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy can only move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk:**\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,0), far from my possible moves.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (9,0), also far.  \nNo head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**\n\n- (3,3): distance |4-3|+|1-3|=3 steps, but blocked by my body at (3,2) and (2,3).\n- (0,0): distance 5 steps.\n- (7,9): distance 11 steps.\n- (9,8): distance 12 steps.\n- (0,8): distance 12 steps.\n\nClosest reachable apple is (0,0), accessible via moving DOWN then LEFT along bottom.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future options after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (4,2):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (4,2):  \nUP to (4,3) empty, DOWN to (4,1) empty, LEFT to (3,2) my body \u2192 not safe, RIGHT to (5,2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\n**DOWN to (4,0):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (4,0):  \nUP to (4,1) empty, DOWN off board \u2192 no, LEFT to (3,0) empty, RIGHT to (5,0) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,1):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (5,1):  \nUP to (5,2) empty, DOWN to (5,0) empty, LEFT to (4,1) empty, RIGHT to (6,1) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.\n\nRIGHT gives most options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term planning:**\n\nI have length 7 vs enemy length 3. My main risk is trapping myself near my long body. Moving RIGHT opens space and avoids my body cluster at left.  \nMoving DOWN toward (0,0) apple is viable, but moving RIGHT first keeps more options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (5,1), consider moving UP toward (7,9) apple if enemy not threatening, or continue RIGHT/DOWN to stay safe. Monitor enemy movement; they may go for (9,8) or (7,9) apples. Avoid boxing myself in corners.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",
