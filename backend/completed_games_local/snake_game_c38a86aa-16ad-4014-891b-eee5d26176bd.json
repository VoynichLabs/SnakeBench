If enemy moves LEFT to (4, 6), no collision. If enemy moves UP-LEFT? Not allowed, only one move. So only possible head-on collision if enemy moves to (4, 8) same as me. Enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (5, 6): UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6). So enemy cannot reach (4, 8) in one move. So UP is safe from head-on collision.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 inside board, no body, but enemy head is currently at (5, 6). If enemy moves LEFT to (4, 6), we collide head-on and both die. That\u2019s risky. So DOWN is **unsafe** because enemy could move LEFT into same cell.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 inside board, has an apple at (3, 7). No body. Could enemy reach (3, 7) in one move? From (5, 6): UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6). No, enemy cannot reach (3, 7). So LEFT is safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 inside board, no body. Could enemy reach (5, 7)? Yes, enemy moving UP from (5, 6) goes to (5, 7). That would be head-on collision. So RIGHT is **unsafe** for same reason as DOWN.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for advantage:**  \n\n- **LEFT (3, 7)**: eats apple immediately, grows to length 2, body segment at (4, 7). This is good for score, but after eating, my body blocks (4, 7) next turn. But I\u2019ll be at (3, 7) with body behind at (4, 7). Next turn options from (3, 7): UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7), RIGHT (4, 7) but that\u2019s into my own new body (dead). So RIGHT would be blocked immediately. That reduces future options.  \n\n- **UP (4, 8)**: no apple, but keeps more options open. From (4, 8) next turn: UP (4, 9), DOWN (4, 7) (currently empty, will be empty unless enemy moves there), LEFT (3, 8), RIGHT (5, 8). All 4 possible moves open. Also, apple at (2, 9) is two moves away (UP then LEFT LEFT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider enemy position and likely moves:**  \nEnemy at (5, 6). Apples nearby: (2, 5), (3, 7), (7, 7). Closest to enemy is (3, 7) but I might take it now if I go LEFT. If enemy wants (3, 7), they\u2019d need two moves: LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT. But if I take it now, they can\u2019t. That\u2019s good for denying them.  \n\nBut if I go LEFT and eat apple, I grow, but my next move options reduce because of my own body behind me. Could be risky if enemy chases.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term thinking:**  \nEarly game, eating apples quickly is good, but staying alive is more important. Going LEFT to eat apple now gives me a point lead, but I must be careful not to get trapped. From (3, 7) after eating, I can go UP to (3, 8) (safe likely), then maybe toward (2, 9).  \n\nEnemy might go for (7, 7) if I take (3, 7). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check: if I go LEFT and eat apple, enemy\u2019s possible moves: they might go UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6) etc. They won\u2019t collide with me because I\u2019ll be at (3, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe.  \nLEFT gets immediate apple, starts growth, gives score advantage.  \nUP keeps more flexibility.  \n\nGiven the board is open and enemy is not too close to trap me, taking the apple now seems beneficial. I\u2019ll go LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3, 7) and eating apple, my body will be at (4, 7). Next turn avoid moving RIGHT into own body. Prefer UP to (3, 8) or LEFT to (2, 7) to stay safe and head toward apple at (2, 9). Watch enemy\u2019s new position for possible collisions.  \n\nLEFT",

No. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 immediate death. **Not safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (5, 5). They can move UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).  \nNone of these intersect my possible destinations (3, 8), (3, 6), (2, 7) this turn. So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for advantage:**  \n\n- **UP (3, 8)**: no apple, but opens path toward apple (2, 9) in 2 moves (LEFT then UP). Keeps options open next turn.  \n\n- **DOWN (3, 6)**: no apple, moves away from most apples except (2, 5) eventually.  \n\n- **LEFT (2, 7)**: no apple, moves toward apple (2, 9) (UP UP) or (2, 5) (DOWN DOWN).  \n\nClosest apple to me: (2, 9) is 2 moves away (LEFT then UP from current head).  \nFrom (3, 7):  \n- LEFT (2, 7) then UP (2, 8) then UP (2, 9) \u2192 actually 3 moves? Wait, check:  \n(3, 7) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 yes 3 moves.  \n(3, 7) \u2192 UP (3, 8) \u2192 LEFT (2, 8) \u2192 UP (2, 9) \u2192 also 3 moves.  \n\nSo both UP and LEFT first step equally far from (2, 9).  \n\nApple (7, 7) is 4 moves away, not urgent.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nFrom (3, 8) next turn: possible moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (unless enemy moves into one).  \nFrom (2, 7) next turn: possible moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (RIGHT is (3, 7) which is empty now but will be empty unless enemy moves there).  \nFrom (3, 6) next turn: possible moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nAll safe moves keep good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Deny enemy apples?**  \nEnemy at (5, 5) closest apple is (2, 5) or (7, 7). If I go LEFT to (2, 7), I\u2019m closer to (2, 5) but not blocking directly. If enemy goes for (2, 5), they\u2019d need 3 moves: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN. I could potentially intercept.  \n\nBut early game, growing safely is key. No apple in immediate move, so focus on positioning toward nearest apple while avoiding future traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose best move:**  \nUP (3, 8) seems slightly better than LEFT (2, 7) because:  \n- It keeps me closer to center, more escape routes.  \n- From (3, 8), I can go LEFT toward (2, 9) next turn.  \n- Avoids moving toward enemy (who might go for (2, 5) and cross paths later).  \n\nDOWN (3, 6) moves away from most apples, so less desirable.  \n\nI\u2019ll go **UP**.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3, 8), body at (3, 7) and (4, 7). Next turn avoid moving DOWN into (3, 7). Target apple (2, 9) by moving LEFT next turn if safe. Watch enemy\u2019s new position for possible collisions.  \n\nUP",

Not safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves and head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (4, 5) can move to: (4, 6), (4, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5).  \n\nMy possible destinations:  \n- UP (3, 9) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- LEFT (2, 8) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n\nNo direct head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to me is (2, 9):  \nFrom (3, 8):  \n- UP (3, 9) \u2192 then LEFT (2, 9) \u2192 2 moves to apple.  \n- LEFT (2, 8) \u2192 then UP (2, 9) \u2192 also 2 moves to apple.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8) \u2192 farther from (2, 9).  \n\nApple (7, 7) is farther. Apple (2, 5) is closer to enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- **UP (3, 9)**: Next turn, possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP off board). Only 3 options, and one is into (3, 8) which will be my body next turn if I move UP now. So from (3, 9), safe moves next turn: LEFT (2, 9) if apple still there, RIGHT (4, 9). DOWN into (3, 8) is body. So only 2 safe moves unless apple eaten.  \n- **LEFT (2, 8)**: Next turn, possible moves: UP (2, 9) if apple there, DOWN (2, 7), RIGHT (3, 8) (body), LEFT (1, 8). So 3 safe moves if apple not eaten, 2 if apple eaten and I grow.  \n- **RIGHT (4, 8)**: Next turn, possible moves: UP (4, 9), DOWN (4, 7), LEFT (3, 8) (body), RIGHT (5, 8). So 3 safe moves unless apple eaten.  \n\nLEFT and RIGHT give slightly better future mobility than UP because UP puts me on top edge with fewer options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (4, 5) likely goes for (2, 5) or (7, 7). If they go for (2, 5), they\u2019ll move LEFT to (3, 5) or (2, 5) eventually. That doesn\u2019t intersect my immediate moves.  \n\nBut if I go LEFT to (2, 8), I\u2019m closer to (2, 9) apple and also closer to possibly intercepting (2, 5) later if needed.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose best move:**  \nUP (3, 9) reduces options next turn.  \nRIGHT (4, 8) moves away from nearest apple.  \nLEFT (2, 8) keeps me near (2, 9) and maintains good mobility.  \n\nI\u2019ll go **LEFT** to position for apple (2, 9) next turn while keeping escape routes.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 8), body at (3, 8) and (3, 7). If apple (2, 9) still there, consider UP to eat it if safe (check enemy\u2019s new head position). If enemy moves toward (2, 5), they\u2019ll be at (3, 5) or (4, 4) etc., not an immediate threat to (2, 9).  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, by then body will have moved. Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nTurn now: head to (4, 0), body becomes [(4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1)].  \nNext turn: head to (3, 0), body becomes [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)], length 3 still.  \nThen eat apple at (2, 0): head to (2, 0), body becomes [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)], length 4.  \nFrom (2, 0): UP (2, 1) empty (since old body moved away), DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT (1, 0) apple \u2705, RIGHT (3, 0) body \u274c \u2192 only 1 safe move (LEFT to apple). That\u2019s dangerous\u2014could trap after eating (1, 0).  \n\nSo DOWN now leads to a risky path after eating first apple.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility: UP or RIGHT.  \nUP (4, 2) seems good\u2014stays central, can go DOWN later toward apples if enemy stays up.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 2), assess enemy movement. If enemy goes for (4, 8), I can move toward bottom apples safely. Keep growing while avoiding dead ends.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s far from (9, 2) for now.  \n\nBut (9, 2) is 4 steps from me if I go RIGHT now: (5,2) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (9,2).  \nEnemy at (6,8) is 6 steps from (9,2) via DOWN and RIGHT moves. So I could potentially beat enemy to (9,2) if I commit RIGHT now, but that\u2019s a long path with possible interference.  \n\nBetter short-term plan: go UP to stay safe and flexible, then next turn reassess apple positions after enemy moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 3), if enemy takes (4, 8), I\u2019ll head toward bottom apples via DOWN and LEFT over next few turns.

It might move toward center or apples at (1, 7) or (9, 2).  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 0), I\u2019ll be near bottom-left corner with apples at (8, 0) and (9, 2) still available later.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 0), I\u2019ll be near bottom-center, possibly closer to enemy if it moves down later.  \n\nBut enemy is far away for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating either apple, I\u2019ll be at length 5, still much shorter than enemy (7). Need to chain apples quickly while staying safe.  \nThe apple at (1, 7) is near enemy\u2019s area \u2014 avoid that for now.  \nBottom row apples (1, 0) and (3, 0) are safe now. After eating one, the other disappears, leaving (8, 0) and (9, 2) as next targets.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick LEFT to (1, 0) because it moves me slightly away from enemy\u2019s current x=2 column, possibly reducing chance of meeting if enemy moves straight down later.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (1, 0), from (1, 0) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 1) or LEFT (0, 0) are safe.  \n- Choose based on enemy position then, but likely go UP toward (9, 2) or (8, 0) eventually.  \n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s check).  \n\nActually, after I move, my tail (2, 3) stays unless I eat an apple. So next turn from (0, 0):  \n- UP (0, 1) empty  \n- RIGHT (1, 0) empty (since my body is at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) after head moves to (0,0))  \nWait, careful: If I move LEFT to (0, 0), my body becomes: head (0,0), then old head (1,0) becomes new segment 2, then (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3). So (1,0) is occupied next turn. So from (0,0), only UP is safe next turn (RIGHT into (1,0) is body). That\u2019s a trap.  \n\nIf I move UP to (1, 1), my body: head (1,1), then (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3). Next turn from (1,1):  \n- UP (1, 2) empty  \n- DOWN (1, 0) body \u274c  \n- LEFT (0, 1) empty  \n- RIGHT (2, 1) body \u274c  \nSo two safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT).  \n\nThus UP gives better mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy might go UP to (1, 7) for apple, or DOWN to (1, 5), or LEFT to (0, 6). If enemy goes UP, it will be at (1, 7) and closer to apple at (1, 3) next turn. I want to avoid being in its path.  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 1), I could later go UP again toward (1, 3) but enemy might get there first. Maybe better to go toward bottom-left apples (8, 0) and (9, 2) eventually.  \n\nFrom (1, 1), I can go LEFT to (0, 1) next, then UP toward (0, 2) etc., working my way to (9, 2) along bottom rows.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (7 vs my 5), so avoid direct confrontation. Collect apples on bottom half: (8, 0) and (9, 2) are far from enemy currently.  \n\nUP now keeps options open, LEFT now leads to a corner with only one exit next turn (dangerous).  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 1), likely go LEFT to (0, 1) to start moving toward bottom-left side, then up along left wall toward (0, 9) and across top to (9, 2) apple, avoiding enemy\u2019s area around y=6-8.  \n\nUP",

It would take enemy 4 moves to reach (1,3) from (1,8) if it goes straight down: (1,8)\u2192(1,7)\u274cbody, so it can\u2019t go down next turn if at (1,8). So enemy likely goes to (0,7) to avoid trapping itself.  \n\nGiven that, I can safely get (1,3) apple in two turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nGet (1,3) apple next, then maybe go left toward (3,0) or (4,2) while avoiding enemy\u2019s longer body. Enemy is in top-left area, so maybe I should collect apples on bottom and right side after (1,3).  \n\nGoing UP now sets up for (1,3) apple.  \nGoing LEFT delays that apple, possibly letting enemy come down and block me.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP to (1, 2) to secure (1, 3) apple next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), go UP to (1, 3) to eat apple, then likely go LEFT to (0, 3) to avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s territory (top rows). Then work down left side toward (3,0) or (4,2).  \n\nUP",

I will continue moving right until at least x=5 or x=6 before turning down. This ensures that as I descend, my body follows along the top and left, leaving the bottom right quadrant open for me to navigate toward the (9, 2) and (8, 0) apples without boxing myself in against my own tail.\n\nRIGHT",

My goal is to navigate toward the apples on the right side of the board: (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) allows me to continue my path along the top wall before turning down the right edge. This keeps the center of the board open and prevents me from cutting myself off with my own long tail.\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 8) is safe but moves me into the open area earlier.

That\u2019s a good target because:  \n1. Two apples close together means less travel per apple.  \n2. Enemy is far top right, unlikely to reach those apples soon.  \n3. My body blocks some central area, but left side is fairly open.  \n\nGoing RIGHT toward (8,0) puts me closer to enemy\u2019s territory (enemy at (9,8)), but enemy is far up, not near (8,0) yet. Still, (8,0) is only one apple, then I\u2019d need to go up for (9,2) or back left.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself:**  \n\nFrom (2,0) next turn, I can go UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0).  \nFrom (4,0) next turn, I can go UP to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,0).  \n\nBoth are okay, but LEFT direction now aligns with the two-apple cluster.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo LEFT now to (2,0). Next turn, go UP to (2,1) to keep moving toward (0,4)/(0,5) while staying away from bottom edge. Avoid moving into my own body trail. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s movement toward top-left apples later.  \n\nLEFT",

UP gives me more options and still allows me to go left next turn to (0,1) and then up the left edge toward the apples.  \n\nBetter to prioritize flexibility over directness here, especially since enemy is far away and I have time.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping later:**  \nFrom (1,1), I can go to (0,1) next turn, then (0,2), etc., up the left edge.

After eating, I\u2019ll be at (0, 4) with apple (0, 5) above. Enemy is far right side, not an immediate threat.  \n\nRisk of UP: After eating (0, 4) and then (0, 5), I\u2019ll be at (0, 5) with only RIGHT as safe move (since DOWN is body, LEFT off board, UP off board). That\u2019s a potential trap in 2 turns.  \n\nBut I can plan: from (0, 4) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (1, 4) instead of UP to (0, 5), to keep more options open. That means leaving apple (0, 5) for later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP now to eat (0, 4). Next turn from (0, 4), go RIGHT to (1, 4) to avoid getting trapped in left column. This keeps mobility high and still allows access to (1, 8) or (3, 6) later.  \n\nUP is best for immediate point lead and safe if followed by RIGHT next turn.  \n\nUP",

Moves away from most apples.  \n\n**Option RIGHT to (3, 5):**  \nNo apple.  \nFrom (3, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) apple \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) my body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) empty \u2705  \n3 safe moves next turn, one leads to apple (3, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare UP vs RIGHT:**  \nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn and access to (3, 6) next turn.  \nUP (2, 6) \u2192 can go RIGHT to (3, 6) apple next turn, or UP/LEFT.  \nRIGHT (3, 5) \u2192 can go UP to (3, 6) apple next turn, or DOWN/RIGHT.  \n\nDifference:  \n- UP (2, 6) leaves me closer to (1, 8) apple later.  \n- RIGHT (3, 5) moves me more centrally, slightly closer to (5, 4) apple.  \n\nEnemy is far away in bottom-right, so central movement is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself:**  \nMy body runs along left and bottom edges. Moving UP or RIGHT keeps me away from that body cluster. DOWN reduces mobility and moves me toward my own body. So DOWN is less desirable.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nRIGHT to (3, 5) might be slightly better because:  \n- From (3, 5), next turn I can choose UP to apple (3, 6) or RIGHT toward (5, 4).  \n- From (2, 6), next turn I can choose RIGHT to apple (3, 6) or UP toward (1, 8).  \n\nBut apple (3, 6) is reachable from both in 1 step next turn.  \n\nActually, UP to (2, 6) might be slightly safer because it\u2019s farther from enemy\u2019s possible future moves (enemy at (8,1) moving up/left).  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nIf enemy goes UP to (8, 2), then LEFT to (7, 2), etc., still far.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 1), then UP to (7, 2), etc., still far.  \n\nNo immediate danger either way.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll choose UP to (2, 6) because:  \n1. Keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n2. Puts me in position to get apple (3, 6) next turn.  \n3. Also keeps path open toward apple (1, 8) after that.  \n4. Avoids moving too close to my body along bottom.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 6), likely go RIGHT to (3, 6) to eat apple, unless enemy suddenly moves toward that area. Monitor enemy\u2019s head movement.  \n\nUP",

Eating it would grow me, adding a segment at tail (currently (0,3)).  \n- Apple (0, 5) is 2 steps away (LEFT then DOWN from (1,7)), but my body occupies (0,4) and (0,3), so path is tricky.  \n- Apple (2, 4) is 3 steps away, but near enemy head (4,4).  \n- Apple (3, 1) and (8, 8) far.  \n\nClosest and safest apple is (1, 6) via DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (1, 6):**  \nFrom (1, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 7) my body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 5) my body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 6) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6) my body \u274c  \nOnly 1 safe move next turn (LEFT).

That\u2019s very limiting.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy path:**  \nEnemy at (4, 4) might move toward apple (2, 4) or (3, 1). If enemy goes LEFT to (3, 4), it\u2019s closer to (2, 4) apple.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7), I stay flexible and can go DOWN to (0, 6) next turn, possibly toward apple (0, 5) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT is suicide next turn.  \nDOWN gives immediate apple but leaves only 1 safe move next turn (LEFT to (0, 6)), which could still be okay if I plan to go DOWN to (0,5) after, but that\u2019s tight with body at (0,4).  \nLEFT to (0, 7) gives 2 safe moves next turn and keeps options open.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m behind in apples (11 vs 12), maybe take the apple? But being trapped after eating it is dangerous if enemy can cut me off.  \n\nBetter to stay alive and flexible. Enemy could die from its own poor moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 7), check if apple (1, 6) still there (if enemy didn\u2019t take it). Possibly go DOWN to (0, 6) next turn to approach apple (0, 5) later. Avoid getting trapped in top-left corner.  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap at top edge.\n\n**DOWN to (0, 6):**  \nFrom (0, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 7) my body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 5) apple \u2705 (and empty except apple)  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6) apple \u2705 (and empty except apple)  \nTwo safe moves next turn (DOWN to apple, RIGHT to apple).  \n\nDOWN gives better options next turn and moves toward apples (0, 5) or (1, 6).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy likely moves LEFT to (2, 4) to eat apple (2, 4). That puts enemy at (2, 4) next turn, closer to (1, 6) apple. If I go DOWN to (0, 6), I can go RIGHT to (1, 6) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take it. But if enemy goes to (2, 4), it could also go DOWN to (2, 3) or LEFT to (1, 4) (my body) or UP to (2, 5) (my body). So enemy might not take (1, 6) immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (0, 6), I can go DOWN to (0, 5) apple next turn, then maybe LEFT to (0, 4)? Wait, (0, 4) is my body now, but after moving, tail moves? Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go DOWN to (0, 6) and don\u2019t eat apple, my tail (0, 4) moves to (0, 3)? No, tail only moves if no apple eaten. Actually, tail moves forward each turn unless apple eaten. So after moving to (0, 6) without eating apple, my body becomes: head (0, 6), then (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4) \u2014 tail (1, 4) is new tail? Wait, original body length 11 segments (head + 10 body). Moving without apple keeps length same: head moves, each segment shifts, last segment (tail) disappears from old position. So tail was (0, 4) \u2192 gone. New tail is (1, 4). Yes. So (0, 4) becomes free next turn. That means from (0, 6), going DOWN to (0, 5) apple next turn is safe because (0, 4) will be empty. Good.\n\nSo DOWN now to (0, 6) sets up apple (0, 5) next turn safely.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Compare UP vs DOWN:**  \nUP leads to dead end quickly. DOWN leads to apple opportunities and more space.  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (11 vs 12), so grabbing (0, 5) next turn is good.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 6), go DOWN to (0, 5) apple if enemy not threatening. If enemy blocks, maybe RIGHT to (1, 6) if it\u2019s still there. Avoid moving toward enemy head at (2, 4) if enemy goes there.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 6) and eat apple, my body grows: new head (1, 6), old head (0, 6) becomes second segment, then (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4) \u2014 tail stays (1, 4).  \n\nAdjacent to (1, 6):  \n- UP (1, 7) \u2192 body (old head\u2019s old position? Wait, (1, 7) is in body list after shift? Yes, (1, 7) is third segment after shift) \u274c  \n- DOWN (1, 5) \u2192 body (tail? No, tail is (1, 4), (1, 5) is second-to-last segment) \u274c  \n- LEFT (0, 6) \u2192 body (second segment) \u274c  \n- RIGHT (2, 6) \u2192 body (ninth segment) \u274c  \n\nSo after eating apple at (1, 6), I\u2019d be completely surrounded by my own body next turn \u2014 death.  \n\nSo RIGHT to (1, 6) is suicide next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Re-evaluate DOWN to (0, 5):**  \nFrom (0, 5) after eating apple:  \nBody grows: head (0, 5), old head (0, 6) second, (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4) \u2014 tail stays (1, 4).  \n\nAdjacent to (0, 5):  \n- UP (0, 6) \u2192 body \u274c  \n- DOWN (0, 4) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1, 5) \u2192 body \u274c  \n\nOnly DOWN is safe next turn. That\u2019s still a trap, but maybe after moving DOWN to (0, 4) next turn, more options open up.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider not eating apple this turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (0, 5) but don\u2019t eat apple? That\u2019s impossible \u2014 apple is there, so automatically eaten.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 6) but don\u2019t eat apple? Also impossible \u2014 apple there.  \n\nSo both safe moves eat an apple, increasing length, reducing future space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Compare the two:**  \nRIGHT to (1, 6) \u2192 immediate death next turn (no moves).  \nDOWN to (0, 5) \u2192 one move possible next turn (DOWN to (0, 4)), then from (0, 4) maybe more options.  \n\nSo DOWN is better.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy movement:**  \nEnemy goes to (2, 3). That\u2019s away from me, so no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 5), only DOWN to (0, 4) is safe. Then from (0, 4), check UP (0, 5) body, LEFT off, RIGHT (1, 4) body? Wait, (1, 4) is tail now, but after moving to (0, 5) this turn, tail stays (1, 4). So next turn from (0, 4), RIGHT (1, 4) is tail \u2014 safe if tail moves? Tail moves after a non-apple move. If I go from (0, 5) to (0, 4) next turn without eating apple (no apple at (0, 4)), tail moves from (1, 4) to (1, 5)? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nTurn 55: head to (0, 5) eat apple \u2192 body length 12, tail (1, 4) stays.  \nTurn 56: head to (0, 4) no apple \u2192 body shifts, tail (1, 4) disappears, new tail (1, 5). So at moment of moving to (0, 4), adjacent cells:  \n- UP (0, 5) body \u274c  \n- DOWN (0, 3) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT off \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1, 4) empty (old tail, now free) \u2705  \n\nSo from (0, 4) next turn, two moves possible: DOWN or RIGHT. That\u2019s survivable.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN is the only viable choice.  \n\nDOWN",

No, (1, 3) is diagonal from (0, 4) \u2192 not adjacent.  \nIf enemy goes to (2, 4), also not adjacent to (0, 4).  \nSo no immediate threat next turn from enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nWe are trapped along left edge with limited space. Need to work toward center without hitting own body.  \nFrom (0, 4) next turn, RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe and moves toward more open area. Then from (1, 4), possible moves: UP (1, 5) is body now but will clear as tail moves later; DOWN (1, 3) likely safe; RIGHT (2, 4) could be enemy\u2019s position next turn \u2014 check then.  \nGoal: snake toward bottom-left area (0,3), (1,3), etc., to loop around and maybe reach apple at (3,1) later. Avoid getting stuck on left wall.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly one safe move this turn: DOWN.  \n\nDOWN",

Fatal (backwards into body).\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 1). **Safe.** Moves toward the right edge.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- I just ate the apple at (3, 1). My body is long (15 segments) and currently creates a barrier in the middle-bottom.\n- The enemy head is at (1, 3), quite close to the left wall and my body at (2, 3).\n- **Apples:** (1, 5) and (1, 6) are near the enemy. (9, 5) and (8, 8) are to my right/top-right. (5, 9) is at the top.\n- Moving **UP** to (3, 2) is the most flexible move. It keeps me away from the bottom wall and allows me to navigate toward (9, 5) or (5, 9) depending on how the enemy moves.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 1) is also safe, but puts me closer to my own tail section at (6, 1)-(8, 1).\n- Moving **DOWN** to (3, 0) limits my vertical movement options.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove towards the center-right to access apples at (9, 5) and (8, 8). The enemy is currently somewhat trapped in the upper-left corridor; I should avoid sealing myself into the bottom-right corner while my tail is still clearing out of that area. UP is the best transitional move to maintain board control.\n\nUP",

I need to avoid being trapped.  \nRIGHT to (2, 3) gives good mobility but puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible UP move.  \nDOWN to (1, 2) keeps distance and still has 3 moves next turn.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s body occupies much of the right side (columns 2\u20138 in rows 4,3,2,1,0), moving DOWN then maybe LEFT/DOWN next turn keeps me in open space near bottom-left.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), likely go LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1) to stay clear of enemy while aiming to circle toward apples on right later.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN to (4, 1) puts me very close to my tail at (7, 1), which is moving away. Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) is safe. Moving UP to (4, 3) is also safe, but puts me in the \"pocket\" created by my body at (4, 4).\n- **Apples:** The nearest \"safe\" apples are to the right and top: (9, 5), (8, 8), and (5, 9). The apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6) are heavily guarded/enclosed by Snake #0.\n- **Snake #0:** Their head is at (1, 1). They are likely trying to navigate out of the bottom left. Moving RIGHT or DOWN keeps me far from them.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (5, 2) to exit the narrow area between my body segments and head towards the open field on the right side of the board. This allows me to pursue the apple at (9, 5) and eventually (8, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

It is bordered by my own body at (5, 2), (5, 4), (4, 4), (6, 4), and (6, 3).\n4. **DOWN:** (5, 1) - **Safe.** This cell is currently empty.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Space and Maneuverability:** My head is currently in a narrow passage created by my own body.\n    - Moving **UP to (5, 3)** puts me in a 1x1 pocket. From (5, 3), I would be surrounded by: (5, 4) Body, (5, 2) Body, (4, 3) Empty, (6, 3) Body. However, (4, 3) is a viable exit next turn as the tail moves. \n    - Moving **DOWN to (5, 1)** is more open. From (5,1), I have (4,1) and (6,1) which are body but (6,1) is the tail. Crucially, (5,0) is open.\n- **Goal:** Get to the right side of the board to collect apples at (9, 5) and (8, 8). \n- **Tail Movement:** My tail is at (6, 1). Next turn, (6, 1) will be empty. If I move DOWN to (5, 1), I can potentially follow my tail out.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move DOWN to (5, 1). This keeps me away from the \"u-bend\" of my current body and allows me to navigate toward the bottom-right or bottom-center (5, 0) and then swing around the right side toward the apples at (9, 5) and (8, 8).\n\nDOWN",

Moving RIGHT to (2, 0) moves slightly toward right-side apples (8, 8), (9, 5), (5, 9) but still far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nEnemy at (5, 2) could go UP or DOWN.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 0), enemy is far.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 0), enemy could go DOWN to (5, 1) and then be closer, but not immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nMy body blocks the top-left region. I need to navigate around the bottom and right side to get apples and avoid dead ends.  \nFrom (0, 0), only UP next turn to (0, 1), then from (0, 1) I\u2019d have UP (0, 2) and DOWN (0, 0) \u2014 but (0, 2) is empty now and might be safe unless enemy moves toward it.  \nFrom (2, 0), only RIGHT next turn to (3, 0), then from (3, 0) I could go UP (3, 1) or RIGHT (4, 0) \u2014 but (3, 1) is enemy body currently, so that\u2019s blocked next turn unless enemy moves away.  \n\nActually, check enemy body: (3, 1) is in enemy body list, so from (3, 0) next turn, UP is blocked. So (3, 0) \u2192 only RIGHT (4, 0) safe. That\u2019s a narrow path along bottom edge.  \n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 0) seems slightly safer long-term because it keeps me away from enemy\u2019s current area and I can go up the left side where there\u2019s more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 0), go UP to (0, 1), then assess. Try to work up left side to (0, 2), (0, 3) etc., then move right across top later to reach apples on right side. Avoid moving into center where enemy is.  \n\nLEFT",

I need to navigate up the left column (0, y), then at (0, 3) or (0, 4) I can\u2019t go right because my body is there, so I must go up to (0, 5) \u2014 but (0, 5) is my body currently. Wait, that\u2019s a problem: my body occupies (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7) in column 0. So going up column 0 will hit myself at (0, 4) after (0, 3).  \n\nActually, let\u2019s trace:  \nNow: head at (0, 0), body: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8).  \n\nIf I go UP to (0, 1), body becomes: head (0, 1), then (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8) \u2014 tail (2, 8) disappears (no apple eaten).  \n\nSo at (0, 1), UP to (0, 2) is safe, UP to (0, 3) is safe, but (0, 4) is still my body next turn. So I can only go up to (0, 3) max, then must go RIGHT to (1, 3) \u2014 but (1, 3) is my old body segment that will still be there next turn? Let\u2019s check:  \nAfter moving to (0, 1), body segment at (1, 3) is still there (it\u2019s the 5th segment). So (1, 3) is occupied.  \n\nSo path: (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 then from (0, 3), possible moves:  \nUP (0, 4) \u274c body  \nDOWN (0, 2) \u274c body  \nLEFT off board \u274c  \nRIGHT (1, 3) \u274c body  \n\nThat\u2019s a dead end!  \n\nSo UP now leads to a trap in 2 moves unless I eat an apple to grow and shift body.  \n\nBut no apple reachable before (0, 3).  \n\nThis means **UP is actually a trap** \u2014 I\u2019ll be stuck at (0, 3) with no moves.  \n\n---\n\nWait \u2014 I must recheck:  \nFrom (0, 1) next turn, I have UP (0, 2) and DOWN (0, 0) safe.  \nIf I go UP to (0, 2) next turn, then body: head (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7) \u2014 tail (1, 8) gone.  \n\nThen from (0, 2):  \nUP (0, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705  \nDOWN (0, 1) \u2192 body \u274c  \nLEFT off \u274c  \nRIGHT (1, 2) \u2192 body \u274c  \n\nSo from (0, 2) only UP is safe. Then from (0, 3):  \nUP (0, 4) \u2192 body \u274c  \nDOWN (0, 2) \u2192 body \u274c  \nLEFT off \u274c  \nRIGHT (1, 3) \u2192 body \u274c  \n\nYes \u2014 dead end at (0, 3).  \n\nSo UP now is fatal in 3 turns.  \n\n---\n\nBut I have no other legal move from (0, 0) now.  \nThis means I must eat an apple before reaching (0, 3) to avoid dead end.  \n\nClosest apple is (1, 5) or (1, 6). From (0, 1), I can\u2019t reach them directly because (1, 1) is body.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check if I can go (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 then apple? No, apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6) are too far.  \n\nSo I\u2019m doomed if I go UP?  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe I can go (0, 1) \u2192 DOWN (0, 0) next turn to avoid trap, but that just delays.  \n\nBut if I go (0, 1) \u2192 DOWN (0, 0), then from (0, 0) next turn, only UP (0, 1) safe again \u2014 infinite loop, but enemy may interfere.  \n\nThis is bad.  \n\nGiven only UP is legal now, I must take it and hope to find a way to eat an apple soon. Maybe enemy dies or I can maneuver later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 1), go DOWN to (0, 0) to avoid immediate trap, then reassess. Try to get to right side by going (0, 0) \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) is impossible, so maybe from (0, 1) go ??? Actually still stuck.  \n\nThis is a tight spot. Only one move now: UP.\n\nUP",

However, my body at (3, 1) and (3, 2) creates a bit of a wall.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 0) moves me toward the open space on the right side of the board (x=7, 8, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (6, 0) to escape the cluster of my own body and the enemy's proximity. Once I reach the right side, I will move UP along the x=7, 8, or 9 columns to collect the apples at (9, 5) and (8, 8).

Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 enemy body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, -1) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nEnemy can go LEFT or RIGHT. My only move is UP to (0, 2). No overlap, so safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after UP to (0, 2):**  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 off \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 body \u274c  \n\nSo only UP is safe next turn if I go UP now. That leads to (0, 3) with only UP again to (0, 4) \u2014 but (0, 4) is my body currently. However, after moving to (0, 2), my tail moves from (1, 8) to (2, 8)? Wait, no \u2014 my tail is (1, 8) currently, but after moving to (0, 2), the body shifts: head (0, 2), then (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7) \u2014 tail (1, 8) disappears (no apple eaten). So (0, 4) is still occupied next turn.  \n\nThus from (0, 3) next turn, UP to (0, 4) is body \u274c, DOWN to (0, 2) body \u274c, LEFT off \u274c, RIGHT (1, 3) body \u274c \u2014 dead end.  \n\nSo UP now leads to a trap in 2 moves unless I eat an apple before reaching (0, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Can I eat an apple in time?**  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn, only UP to (0, 3). From (0, 3), no apple reachable.  \nSo I must eat an apple *this turn* to avoid trap. But no apple at (0, 2).  \n\nSo UP now is fatal in 3 turns unless something changes (enemy dies, I get an apple by some miracle).  \n\nBut I have no other legal move now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nI\u2019m forced UP now. Next turn at (0, 2), only UP is safe, leading to (0, 3) and death the turn after. The only escape is if an apple spawns adjacent to (0, 3) before I get there, or if enemy dies and I can use its body space.  \n\nI should look for any chance to break out \u2014 maybe after moving to (0, 2), if enemy dies and clears (1, 2) or (1, 3), I could go right. Otherwise, I\u2019m doomed.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Enemy dies and its body at (1, 3) disappears, letting me go RIGHT from (0, 3).  \n\nSo next turn, check if (0, 2) or (1, 3) are free and/or have apples. If (0, 2) is free and has an apple, go DOWN to eat and survive. If (1, 3) is free, go RIGHT to escape. Otherwise, I\u2019m dead.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

That means I\u2019m trapped unless something changes between turns.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 the rules say snakes move simultaneously, so maybe enemy #1 dies this turn and its body disappears, freeing up a cell for me?  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, -1) \u2192 off \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 0) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nEnemy could go UP or RIGHT. If enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 0), that\u2019s fine. If enemy goes UP to (7, 1), also fine.  \nBut enemy\u2019s body at (6, 0), (5, 0), etc. won\u2019t disappear until after this turn if enemy dies \u2014 so they\u2019re still there for collision purposes for my move.  \n\nSo (1, 3) is still occupied by my own body, so RIGHT is blocked.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Did I miss something?**  \nCheck my body list: (1, 3) is indeed in my body. (0, 2) is my body. (0, 4) is my body. All adjacent cells are occupied or off-board.  \n\nThat means **I have no safe moves** unless an apple spawns on an adjacent cell at the start of this turn? But apples listed are only the ones currently on board \u2014 no new apples spawn mid-turn except at turn start.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe I misread: the board state shows at (0, 3) is \u201c0\u201d (my head), at (1, 3) is \u201cT\u201d (my tail segment). Yes, so (1, 3) is occupied by me.  \n\nSo I\u2019m completely trapped.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Is there any escape via enemy death?**  \nIf enemy dies this turn, its body disappears next turn, not this turn. So still no effect on my immediate move safety.  \n\nSo I must choose a move, but all kill me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Which move kills me least badly?**  \nIf all moves kill me, maybe I can choose one that might kill enemy too if head-on collision?  \nEnemy head at (7, 0). My head at (0, 3). No overlap possible in one move.  \n\nSo no difference.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Could I have misread my body coordinates?**  \nLet\u2019s trace: My body list says: head (0, 3), then (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7).  \nThat\u2019s 13 body segments? Head + 12 body segments = length 13. Yes, I have eaten 12 apples so length 13 is correct.  \n\nCheck adjacency:  \n- UP (0, 4) \u2192 in body \u2705  \n- DOWN (0, 2) \u2192 in body \u2705  \n- LEFT (-1, 3) \u2192 off \u2705  \n- RIGHT (1, 3) \u2192 in body \u2705  \n\nSo indeed trapped.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nSince all moves are fatal, I\u2019ll pick one arbitrarily \u2014 maybe UP into my own body.  \n\nBut last turn\u2019s rationale warned this would happen \u2014 I went UP to (0, 3) knowing next turn I\u2019d be trapped unless an apple spawned on (0, 2) or (1, 3) freed up.  \nIt didn\u2019t happen.  \n\nSo I\u2019m dead this turn no matter what.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",
