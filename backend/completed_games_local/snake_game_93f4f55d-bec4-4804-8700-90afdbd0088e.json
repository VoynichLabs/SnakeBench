Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (5,4): Contains an apple at (5,4)! Moving onto an apple is safe (I eat it and grow).\n- **RIGHT** to (7,4): Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe. No board boundaries are hit, no self-body, no enemy body in those cells.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for strategy.**\n\nApples are at: (6,6), (5,4), (7,6), (2,6), (2,3).\n\n*   **LEFT to (5,4)**: This moves me directly onto an apple. This is highly desirable\u2014it gives me +1 apple and starts growing my length, which is crucial for long-term survival and scoring. It also positions me at (5,4), which is centrally located with many open paths.\n*   **UP to (6,5)**: Moves me closer to apple (6,6) but not directly onto one. It's a safe step toward a nearby apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (7,4)**: Moves me away from the cluster of apples near me. Less optimal.\n*   **DOWN to (6,3)**: Moves me toward apple (2,3) but it's far. Less immediately beneficial.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake is at (7,0), there is no risk of head-on collision this turn regardless of my move. The primary goal early is to start collecting apples safely.\n\n**Best move:** **LEFT** to (5,4). This secures an apple on the very first turn, giving me an early lead and starting my growth. The position (5,4) afterwards will still have good mobility (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely open next turn).\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating the apple at (5,4), my head will be at (5,4) and I will have a tail segment at my old head (6,4). I'll need to avoid moving back into (6,4) immediately (unless I have other safe options). Look to target the next nearest apple, perhaps (6,6) or (7,6), while keeping an eye on enemy snake #1's movement from (7,0).

From (6,7), next turn: UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6) (now part of my body after growth? Wait: if I don\u2019t eat an apple this turn, my tail at (5,5) moves to (5,6) because I ate an apple last turn? Let\u2019s clarify: I ate an apple last turn (RIGHT to (6,6)), so I grew. My body is now length 3: head (6,6), then (5,6), then (5,5) tail. After this turn (turn 4), if I do NOT eat an apple, my tail will move forward: tail moves from (5,5) to (5,6)? Actually, in Snake, when you grow after eating, the tail stays in place for one turn, then moves normally. Since I ate last turn, my tail will stay at (5,5) this turn. Next turn (turn 5), if I don\u2019t eat now, my tail will move to (5,6). So after moving UP to (6,7) without eating, my body becomes: head (6,7), then (6,6), then (5,6), tail (5,5) remains? Wait, that\u2019s length 4? Let\u2019s recalc:  \nCurrent body: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)].  \nIf I move UP to (6,7) without eating: new head (6,7), add to front, tail (5,5) is removed. So new body: [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6)]. Tail is (5,6). That\u2019s correct. So (6,6) becomes second segment, (5,6) third, tail (5,6).  \nThus, from (6,7) next turn, possible moves: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6) \u2013 but (6,6) will be my body segment (second segment) so unsafe, LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). So only 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n- **DOWN to (6,5)**: Moves away from most apples. From (6,5), next turn: UP back to (6,6) (body segment, unsafe), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5) (empty after tail moves? Tail currently at (5,5) will move to (5,6) if I don\u2019t eat, so (5,5) becomes empty), RIGHT to (7,5). So 3 safe exits (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). But moves away from apples.\n- **RIGHT to (7,6)**: **Eat apple immediately.** I will grow, so my body becomes length 4: head (7,6), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) tail stays. From (7,6) after eating, next turn: UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6) (my body \u2013 unsafe), RIGHT to (8,6). So 3 safe exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Eating now increases my lead (3 vs 0) and grows my body for safety.\n\n**Best move:** **RIGHT** to (7,6). Eating an apple now is optimal: it increases my score lead, grows my body (making me safer from enemy head-on collisions), and positions me near board edge but with exits. The enemy is far away (at (6,3)), so no immediate threat.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating, my head at (7,6), body length 4: segments at (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) tail. Avoid moving LEFT into my own body. Consider UP to (7,7) (safe), DOWN to (7,5) (safe), or RIGHT to (8,6) (safe). Watch for enemy moving toward (7,6) area; enemy at (6,3) could move UP/LEFT/RIGHT but not directly to (7,6) in one turn. Continue targeting nearest apples: (4,7) and (3,7) are northwest, may require a route that avoids boxing myself.\n\nRIGHT",

No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy.**\n\nGoal: eat nearest apple while preserving future mobility.\n\nNearest apples from (7,7):\n- (4,7) \u2013 3 steps away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n- (3,7) \u2013 4 steps away.\n- (2,6) \u2013 5 steps away.\n- (2,3) \u2013 far.\n- (5,1) \u2013 far.\n\nFrom (7,7):\n- **UP to (7,8)**: Moves toward board top. From (7,8), next turn: UP to (7,9) (edge), DOWN to (7,7) (body \u2013 unsafe), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8). So 3 safe exits, but moving toward top edge reduces space. Not directly toward apples.\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: Moves directly toward apples (4,7) and (3,7). From (6,7), next turn: UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6) (body \u2013 unsafe), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7) (body \u2013 unsafe). So only 2 safe exits (UP, LEFT). Mobility reduced but still okay. This is the shortest path to the apple cluster.\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: Moves away from apples toward right edge. From (8,7), next turn: UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7) (body \u2013 unsafe), RIGHT to (9,7). So 3 safe exits, but leads away from apples.\n\n**Best move:** **LEFT** to (6,7). This is the most direct step toward the nearest apples (4,7) and (3,7). Although it reduces immediate safe exits to 2 next turn, it positions me to eat an apple in 2 more moves (LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7)). The enemy is far and not a threat. Eating an apple will extend my lead and body length, improving safety and control.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving LEFT, my head at (6,7), body becomes: [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)] (tail at (5,6) moves off? Wait: I did not eat an apple this turn, so my tail moves forward: old tail (5,6) is removed, new body: head (6,7) + old body minus last segment: so body = [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]? Let's trace: current body: head (7,7), then (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). Move head to (6,7). New head (6,7). Add new head, keep all segments except remove tail (5,6). So new body: [(6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]. Tail at (6,6). Next turn, avoid moving DOWN to (6,6) (body) and RIGHT to (7,7) (body). Safe moves likely UP to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,7). Target apple at (4,7) via LEFT then LEFT. Keep an eye on enemy #1's movement toward apples (2,3) or (5,1).\n\nLEFT",

Wait, rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" The enemy head is not its body; moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head is a simultaneous move scenario. If I move DOWN to (2,6) and enemy also moves, we need to check for head-on collision. But if enemy stays still, I'd move into its head cell? Actually, if enemy stays, its head is at (2,6). If I move into (2,6), our heads occupy same cell \u2192 head-on collision, both die. So DOWN is risky and likely fatal unless enemy moves away. I'll treat as unsafe for now.)\n- **LEFT** to (1,7): Contains apple (1,7). Safe (apple cell is empty of snakes).\n- **RIGHT** to (3,7): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are definitely safe. DOWN is potentially lethal depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,7) (my current head position \u2013 but I will move away)\n- DOWN to (2,5) (its own body \u2013 unsafe for it)\n- LEFT to (1,6) (apple)\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (2,7) and I move LEFT to (1,7), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (1,6) and I move LEFT to (1,7), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (3,6) and I move LEFT, no collision.  \nIf enemy stays at (2,6) and I move DOWN to (2,6), head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (2,7) and I move UP to (2,8), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (1,6) and I move UP, no collision.\n\nThus, DOWN is only safe if enemy moves away from (2,6). But enemy might stay (if it chooses DOWN into its body, that's invalid; it might choose LEFT or RIGHT or UP). Since enemy could stay (maybe it chooses LEFT to (1,6) most likely for apple), DOWN is risky. I'll avoid DOWN unless necessary.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\nLEFT to (1,7) eats apple (1,7) \u2192 grow to length 7, score 6 apples.  \nUP to (2,8) does not eat apple.\n\nEating apple is good to extend lead (I have 5 vs enemy 2). Also, eating apple grows my tail, which might affect future mobility but gives me advantage.\n\nFrom (1,7) after eating apple: body will be head (1,7), then (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) (tail still at (7,7) because growth adds segment at tail next turn). Next turn exits: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6) (apple), LEFT (0,7) board edge, RIGHT (2,7) (my body). So 2 safe exits (UP, DOWN). DOWN leads to apple (1,6).\n\nFrom (2,8) after moving UP: body head (2,8), then (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). Next turn exits: UP (2,9) edge, DOWN (2,7) body, LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8). So 2 safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT). No direct apple access.\n\nLEFT gives immediate apple and sets up next apple (1,6) via DOWN. UP gives no apple and fewer options.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy's likely move.**\n\nEnemy likely wants apple (1,6) or maybe (2,7) if it thinks I'm moving. It might move LEFT to (1,6) to eat that apple. If I move LEFT to (1,7), I eat (1,7) and am adjacent to (1,6). Next turn I could race enemy for (1,6) if it's still there.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (2,7) (where my head was), that's safe for me.\n\n**Best move: LEFT** to eat apple (1,7), increase score to 6, and position near next apple (1,6). This extends my lead and keeps options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (1,7) and eating apple, check if apple (1,6) is still present. If yes, consider moving DOWN to eat it, but check enemy position (enemy might be at (1,6) if it moved LEFT). If enemy is at (1,6), avoid head-on collision and maybe go UP to (1,8) to stay safe and look for other apples. Keep expanding safely; with longer body, avoid boxing myself in corners.\n\nLEFT",

I have 6 apples.  \nEnemy snake #1 head is at (1,6), body [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4)].  \nApples at: (5,1), (8,5), (4,2), (6,4), (0,2).  \nNote: I just ate apple (1,7) last turn, so it's gone.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (1,8): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,6): Contains enemy snake #1's head. **UNSAFE** (moving into enemy head cell risks head-on collision if enemy stays or moves into me).\n- **LEFT** to (0,7): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,7): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are safe. DOWN is risky (head-on collision possible). RIGHT is suicide.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (1,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (1,7) (my current head position \u2013 but I will move away)\n- DOWN to (1,5) (empty)\n- LEFT to (0,6) (empty)\n- RIGHT to (2,6) (its own body \u2013 unsafe for it)\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (1,7) and I move UP to (1,8), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (0,6) and I move LEFT to (0,7), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (1,5) and I move LEFT, no collision.  \nIf enemy stays at (1,6) and I move DOWN to (1,6), head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (1,7) and I move LEFT to (0,7), no collision.\n\nThus, DOWN is only safe if enemy moves away from (1,6). Enemy likely wants to avoid my body and may move LEFT or DOWN. Since RIGHT is unsafe for it, its best safe moves are LEFT or DOWN. It might move LEFT to (0,6) toward apple (0,2) long-term, or DOWN to (1,5). It's unlikely to stay given I'm adjacent. Still, DOWN is risky; I'll avoid unless necessary.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\nLEFT to (0,7) moves to board edge, reducing future exits. From (0,7), next turn exits: UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6) (possible enemy move target), RIGHT (1,7) (my body). Only UP is guaranteed safe, possibly DOWN if enemy not there. That's a potential trap.\n\nUP to (1,8) is open. From (1,8), next turn exits: UP (1,9) edge, DOWN (1,7) (my body), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8). So two safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT). Better mobility.\n\nNo apples are immediately adjacent. The nearest apples are (4,2), (5,1), (6,4), (8,5), (0,2). Moving UP keeps me central and allows future movement toward apples on right side (e.g., (6,4), (8,5)). Moving LEFT corners me.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy's likely move and apple access.**\n\nEnemy likely moves LEFT to (0,6) or DOWN to (1,5). If it moves LEFT to (0,6), then my moving LEFT to (0,7) puts me directly above it, which is okay but limits my options. If enemy moves DOWN to (1,5), then LEFT is still a corner.\n\nUP seems better for maintaining flexibility and avoiding dead-ends.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving UP to (1,8), assess exits. Consider moving RIGHT toward apples (6,4) or (8,5) gradually, while keeping an eye on enemy's position. Avoid getting trapped along top edge. With my long body (length 7), I need to ensure I don't box myself in. Continue to extend lead by targeting apples safely.\n\n**Best move: UP** to maintain mobility and avoid corner.\n\nUP",

That's adjacent but not same cell \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,8), enemy cannot reach (2,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible this turn given enemy's limited moves.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\nFrom each candidate:\n\n**UP (1,9)**: Top edge. Next turn exits: DOWN (1,8) (my body), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9). Only LEFT and RIGHT are safe, but both are on top edge, reducing mobility. Moving UP corners me slightly.\n\n**LEFT (0,8)**: Left edge. Next turn exits: UP (0,9) top-left corner, DOWN (0,7) (possible enemy location if enemy moves UP), RIGHT (1,8) (my body). Only UP is guaranteed safe, DOWN risky if enemy moves to (0,7). This is a potential trap.\n\n**RIGHT (2,8)**: Central area. Next turn exits: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7) (my body), LEFT (1,8) (my body), RIGHT (3,8). Only UP and RIGHT are safe. Better than UP/LEFT edges, but still limited.\n\nAll three safe moves have only 1-2 safe follow-ups. However, RIGHT keeps me more central and closer to apples on the right side (6,4) and (8,5). LEFT moves away from most apples. UP also moves away.\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples: (5,1), (8,5), (4,2), (6,4), (0,2).  \nEnemy is at (0,6) and may move toward (0,2) apple via DOWN moves. If enemy moves DOWN to (0,5), then (0,4), etc., it will claim that apple. I'm far from (0,2), so let enemy have it. My advantage is in apples on right side.\n\nMoving RIGHT positions me better to eventually descend toward (6,4) or (8,5) while avoiding enemy. My body blocks me from moving DOWN immediately, but I can maneuver along top/right.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (2,8), aim to gradually work downward toward apples (6,4) and (8,5) while keeping enemy in view. Avoid getting trapped along top edge. With my length 7, I need to plan a path that doesn't box me in. Next turn, consider moving UP (to (2,9)) or RIGHT (to (3,8)) to stay flexible, then later turn DOWN when my tail moves.\n\nGiven the safe moves, RIGHT offers the best balance of maintaining central position, moving toward apples, and avoiding immediate dead-ends.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn exits: DOWN (5,8) (my body), LEFT (4,9), RIGHT (6,9). Only LEFT and RIGHT safe, both on top edge. This corners me and reduces mobility.\n\n**DOWN (5,7)**: Moves toward center. Next turn exits: UP (5,8) (my body), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe (three exits). Opens path downward toward apples (5,1), (4,2), (6,4). However, moving DOWN puts me closer to my own body trail, which may limit future turns until tail moves.\n\n**RIGHT (6,8)**: Central, continues rightward. Next turn exits: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8) (my body), RIGHT (7,8). Only UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (three exits). This offers good mobility and progresses toward right-side apples (6,4), (8,5), (9,6). My tail is at (2,7) and will advance next turn (since I didn't eat an apple last turn), opening more space behind.\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples: (5,1), (8,5), (4,2), (6,4), (9,6).  \nEnemy is likely moving DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2). It is far away (left side). Moving RIGHT keeps me away from enemy and on a path to collect apples on the right side. DOWN also moves toward apples but into more confined area near my own body. RIGHT gives more open space and direct progress toward (6,4) (two steps away via DOWN after RIGHT).\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (6,8), aim to go DOWN to (6,7) next turn to approach apple (6,4) while keeping mobility. Monitor enemy: it may head toward (4,2) or (5,1) eventually. Plan a route to snake down column 6-8 to collect (6,4), (8,5), and (9,6). Avoid top-edge trap; prefer central moves.\n\nGiven the safe moves, RIGHT offers best future mobility and progress toward apples while avoiding risky confinement.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn exits: UP (6,7) (my body), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). Only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe (three exits). Good mobility, continues toward nearest apple.\n\n**LEFT (5,7)**: Moves left. Next turn exits: UP (5,8) (my body), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) (my body). Only DOWN and LEFT safe (two exits). This reduces mobility and moves away from most apples except (4,2) and (5,1) but is farther.\n\n**RIGHT (7,7)**: Moves right. Next turn exits: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7) (my body), RIGHT (8,7). Only UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (three exits). Good mobility, progresses toward right-side apples (8,5) and (9,6).\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples: (5,1), (8,5), (4,2), (6,4), (9,6).  \nEnemy is far left, likely moving UP/DOWN/RIGHT. It may aim for (4,2) or (5,1).  \nMy nearest apple is (6,4) \u2013 two steps DOWN from (6,6).  \nRIGHT leads toward (8,5) (three steps) and (9,6) (four steps).  \n\nGiven my apple lead (6 vs 4), I should prioritize safety and efficient apple collection. DOWN puts me on a direct path to (6,4) while maintaining good mobility. RIGHT is also safe but delays apple collection. LEFT reduces mobility and is less optimal.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6,6), next turn aim to go DOWN again to (6,5) to approach apple (6,4). Monitor enemy movement; if it heads toward (4,2), I can still loop back toward right-side apples after collecting (6,4). Avoid moving into the left column where my body trail is.\n\nGiven the safe moves, DOWN offers best progress toward nearest apple while keeping multiple exits.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (5,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,3): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Contains apple (5,1).\n- LEFT to (4,2): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,3), enemy cannot reach (6,3) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,4), enemy cannot reach (5,4) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,4), enemy cannot reach (7,4) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\nFrom each candidate:\n\n**DOWN (6,3)**: Moves down. Next turn exits from (6,3): UP (6,4) (my body after growth? Wait: after this move, my body will be: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) tail. So (6,4) will be my second segment, so UP into (6,4) is unsafe. DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3). All three are empty and not enemy body. So three safe exits. Good mobility. Moves toward apple (5,1) but not directly.\n\n**LEFT (5,4)**: Moves left. Next turn exits from (5,4): UP (5,5) (empty), DOWN (5,3) (empty), LEFT (4,4) (empty), RIGHT (6,4) (my body). So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility. Moves closer to apple (3,6) via future UP/LEFT, but also closer to enemy (5,2) \u2014 risk of encounter.\n\n**RIGHT (7,4)**: Moves right. Next turn exits from (7,4): UP (7,5) (empty), DOWN (7,3) (empty), LEFT (6,4) (my body), RIGHT (8,4) (empty). So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility. Moves toward apples (8,5) and (9,6).\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples:  \n- (5,1): Enemy may go DOWN to (5,1) this turn to eat it (enemy score would become 6).  \n- (8,5) and (9,6): In upper-right, relatively safe from enemy currently.  \n- (3,6): Near my tail region, but enemy is far.  \n- (0,1): Far left, enemy could head that way.\n\nMy apple lead is 7 vs 5. Securing another apple soon is good, but avoiding risky encounters is priority. Enemy is at (5,2) and may move DOWN to (5,1) to eat. If I go LEFT to (5,4), I'm close to enemy's possible UP move to (5,3) \u2014 could lead to head-on next turn if we both move toward each other. Safer to move away.\n\nRIGHT (7,4) moves toward (8,5) and away from enemy, maintaining distance. DOWN (6,3) also moves away but toward lower area where (5,1) is, but enemy likely takes (5,1) this turn.\n\nGiven my long body along top rows, I should avoid boxing myself in the top-left. Moving RIGHT opens space toward the right side where apples are and fewer obstacles.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (7,4), my body will be: head (7,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8). Next turn from (7,4), safe moves likely UP/DOWN/RIGHT. Aim to go UP toward (7,5) and then (8,5) apple, while monitoring enemy movement. Keep distance from enemy; if enemy eats (5,1), its score becomes 6, still behind me. Continue collecting apples on right side.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

So (7,4) will be my second segment, so DOWN is unsafe. LEFT (6,5) (my body), RIGHT (8,5) (apple). So safe exits: UP, RIGHT. That\u2019s only two safe exits, but RIGHT leads to apple (8,5). Mobility is somewhat limited but manageable if I plan to eat the apple next turn.\n\n**DOWN (7,3)**: Moves away from apples. Next turn exits from (7,3): UP (7,4) (my body), DOWN (7,2) (empty), LEFT (6,3) (empty), RIGHT (8,3) (empty). So three safe exits (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility, but moves me away from the cluster of apples on the right/upper side.\n\n**RIGHT (8,4)**: Moves right. Next turn exits from (8,4): UP (8,5) (apple), DOWN (8,3) (empty), LEFT (7,4) (my body), RIGHT (9,4) (empty). So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility and positions me to go UP to (8,5) apple next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples:  \n- (8,5) is closest and reachable in 1 move if I go UP, or in 2 moves if I go RIGHT then UP.  \n- (9,6) is nearby but requires two moves.  \n- (3,6) is near my tail region but far.  \n- (0,1) and (0,0) are on the left, enemy may head that way.\n\nMy apple lead is 7 vs 6. Securing another apple soon is good to maintain lead. Enemy is at (5,1) and may move toward left-side apples (0,1) or (0,0), or possibly up toward (3,6). Moving RIGHT or UP keeps me away from enemy and focused on right-side apples.\n\nUP (7,5) gets me closer to (8,5) but reduces my next-turn safe moves to two. However, if I take UP this turn, next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,5) to eat the apple (since RIGHT from (7,5) is safe and leads to apple). That would give me apple #8. That seems efficient.\n\nRIGHT (8,4) also gives good mobility and sets up UP to (8,5) next turn for apple #8, but delays eating by one turn. However, it keeps three safe exits this turn, giving more flexibility if enemy surprises.\n\nGiven my long body along top rows, I want to avoid getting trapped. UP into (7,5) is safe now and leads directly toward apple. I should check if any risk of enemy cutting me off: enemy is far at (5,1), so low risk.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving UP to (7,5), my body will be: head (7,5), then (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8). Next turn, from (7,5), safe moves are UP and RIGHT. I will likely go RIGHT to (8,5) to eat the apple, unless enemy suddenly appears nearby. After eating, my tail will stay at (4,8) and I\u2019ll grow to length 10. Continue collecting apples on right side (e.g., (9,6)) while monitoring enemy movement.\n\n**Best move: UP**\n\nUP",

Safe (eating apple does not kill).\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (4,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,2): Its own body (fourth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (4,0): Within board, empty.\n- LEFT to (3,1): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,1): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (7,6), enemy cannot reach (7,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (8,5), enemy cannot reach (8,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (7,6)**: Moves away from the nearest apple (8,5). Next turn exits from (7,6): UP (7,7) (empty), DOWN (7,5) (my head's previous position, will be occupied by my growing body after this turn? Let's simulate: After moving UP, my body will be: head (7,6), then (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8). So (7,5) becomes my second segment, so DOWN is unsafe. LEFT (6,6) (my body), RIGHT (8,6) (empty). So safe exits: UP, RIGHT. That\u2019s two safe exits. Mobility is limited.\n\n**RIGHT (8,5)**: Moves onto apple, eating it. I will grow next turn (new length 9, tail stays at (5,8)). Next turn exits from (8,5): UP (8,6) (empty), DOWN (8,4) (empty), LEFT (7,5) (my body after growth), RIGHT (9,5) (empty). So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility, and I secure apple #8, extending my lead to 8 vs 6.\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nEating the apple at (8,5) now is highly advantageous\u2014it extends my lead and is low risk. Enemy is far away on the left side and likely heading toward the apples at (0,1) or (0,0). Moving RIGHT to eat the apple gives me better future mobility (three exits) compared to UP (two exits). Also, after eating, I can consider moving toward (9,6) next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (8,5) and eating the apple, my body will be: head (8,5), then (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (5,8). My length becomes 9. From (8,5), safe moves will be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. I should likely go UP to (8,6) to approach the apple at (9,6) (or RIGHT to (9,5) then UP). Keep monitoring enemy movement\u2014it is on the left side and may come up toward (3,6). Maintain my lead by collecting apples on the right side while avoiding getting trapped by my own long body.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn from (8,7): UP (8,8) empty, DOWN (8,6) will be my body after this move? After moving UP, my body: head (8,7), then (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). So (8,6) is second segment, DOWN unsafe. LEFT (7,7) empty, RIGHT (9,7) empty. Safe exits: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good mobility but no apple progress.\n\n**LEFT (7,6)**: Moves toward center. Next turn from (7,6): UP (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) my body (third segment), LEFT (6,6) my body (sixth segment), RIGHT (8,6) my body (second segment). Only safe exit: UP (one exit). Very low mobility \u2014 risks trapping myself.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple (9,6) is adjacent. Eating it extends my lead and is safe. Enemy is far left, likely heading toward apples (0,1),(0,0) or (2,4). I should secure (9,6) now. RIGHT gives immediate apple, though it reduces mobility next turn (only UP/DOWN exits). However, from (9,6) I can go UP to (9,7) next turn, which keeps options open along the top edge. UP (8,7) keeps mobility but delays apple collection, allowing enemy to potentially close the gap. LEFT (7,6) is too restrictive.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to eat apple (9,6), my length becomes 9. Next turn from (9,6), consider UP to (9,7) to move away from edge and toward possible future apples. Avoid moving LEFT into my body. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 it may move toward (3,6). Continue collecting apples on right/top side while maintaining safe exits.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn from (9,7): UP (9,8) empty, DOWN (9,6) will be my body after this move? After moving UP, my body becomes: head (9,7), then (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). So (9,6) is second segment, DOWN unsafe.

Next turn from (9,5): UP (9,6) my body (second segment after this move), DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) my body (third segment), RIGHT off board unsafe. Only safe exit: DOWN (one exit). Very low mobility \u2014 risks trapping myself.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples are all on the left side: (3,6), (0,1), (0,0), (2,4), (4,3). Enemy is near (0,1) and (0,0). I am on the far right. I need to work my way left carefully while maintaining mobility. UP gives two exits and moves me toward the top, where I can later go LEFT across the top row toward apples like (3,6) or (4,3). DOWN leads to a dead-end next turn.\n\nGiven the web search results, one relevant insight from [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) is that a good AI algorithm for Snake focuses on keeping the tail in sight and avoiding creating voids. Here, moving UP keeps more open space accessible and avoids trapping myself in a corner.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving UP to (9,7), next turn I should consider LEFT to (8,7) to move away from the edge and toward the center/top, increasing mobility. Continue working leftward toward apples while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid getting pinned on the right edge.\n\n**Best move: UP**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,7): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (0,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (0,3): Within board, empty.\n- DOWN to (0,1): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (-1,2): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1,2): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (8,8), enemy cannot reach (8,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (7,7), enemy cannot reach (7,7) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (8,8)**: Moves toward top edge. Next turn from (8,8): UP (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) will be my body after this move (second segment), LEFT (7,8) empty, RIGHT (9,8) empty. Safe exits: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). This gives good mobility and stays near the top where apples (3,6) and (2,4) are accessible via leftward movement later.\n\n**LEFT (7,7)**: Moves toward center-left. Next turn from (7,7): UP (7,8) empty, DOWN (7,6) empty, LEFT (6,7) empty, RIGHT (8,7) my body (second segment). Safe exits: UP, DOWN, LEFT (three exits).

It could also eat (0,0) if it moves DOWN, but DOWN is unsafe due to its own body. So (0,0) may remain uneaten this turn.\n\nGiven the objective to eat apples and maintain mobility, moving LEFT gets me closer to the nearest apple while keeping three safe exits. Moving UP keeps me near the top edge but slightly farther from apples.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (7,7), next turn I should consider DOWN to (7,6) or LEFT to (6,7) to continue toward apple (7,3) while monitoring enemy movement.

This gives good mobility but moves away from the nearest apples.\n\n**DOWN (7,6)**: Moves toward apple (7,3) (Manhattan distance from (7,6) to (7,3) = 3). Next turn from (7,6): UP (7,7) my body (second segment), DOWN (7,5) my body (sixth segment), LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) my body (fourth segment). Safe exits: LEFT only (one exit).

It could also eat (0,0) if it moves DOWN, but DOWN is unsafe due to its own body. So (0,0) may remain uneaten this turn.\n\nGiven the objective to stay alive and maintain future options, moving DOWN is too dangerous despite being closer to an apple\u2014having only one safe exit next turn could lead to death if that exit later becomes blocked. Moving UP or LEFT both offer three safe exits. Between them, LEFT moves me toward the cluster of apples on the left side (3,6), (2,4), (4,3) while keeping mobility.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (6,7), next turn I should consider DOWN to (6,6) or LEFT to (5,7) to continue toward apples while monitoring enemy movement.

Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (6,6): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (5,7): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,7): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,3): Within board, empty.\n- DOWN to (2,1): Its own body (fifth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (1,2): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3,2): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (6,8), enemy cannot reach (6,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,6), enemy cannot reach (6,6) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,7), enemy cannot reach (5,7) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (6,8)**: Moves toward top edge. Next turn from (6,8): UP (6,9) empty, DOWN (6,7) will be my body after this move (second segment), LEFT (5,8) empty, RIGHT (7,8) empty. Safe exits: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good mobility but moves away from apples.\n\n**DOWN (6,6)**: Moves toward center. Next turn from (6,6): UP (6,7) my body (second segment), DOWN (6,5) empty, LEFT (5,6) empty, RIGHT (7,6) empty. Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good mobility and moves closer to apple (7,3) (distance from (6,6) to (7,3) = |1|+|3|=4) and also toward (4,3) and (2,4).\n\n**LEFT (5,7)**: Moves left. Next turn from (5,7): UP (5,8) empty, DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT (4,7) empty, RIGHT (6,7) my body (second segment). Safe exits: UP, DOWN, LEFT (three exits). Good mobility and moves toward apples (3,6) and (2,4).\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apple to me is (7,3) at distance |6-7|+|7-3| = 1+4=5 from current head (6,7).  \n- Moving UP to (6,8) increases distance to (7,3) to 6.  \n- Moving DOWN to (6,6) reduces distance to (7,3) to 4.  \n- Moving LEFT to (5,7) increases distance to (7,3) to 6.\n\nApple (3,6) is at distance |6-3|+|7-6|=3+1=4.  \n- UP to (6,8): distance to (3,6) = 3+2=5.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): distance to (3,6) = 3+0=3.  \n- LEFT to (5,7): distance to (3,6) = 2+1=3.\n\nApple (2,4) is at distance |6-2|+|7-4|=4+3=7.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): distance = 4+2=6.  \n- LEFT to (5,7): distance = 3+3=6.\n\nApple (4,3) is at distance |6-4|+|7-3|=2+4=6.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): distance = 2+3=5.  \n- LEFT to (5,7): distance = 1+4=5.\n\nThus DOWN reduces distance to multiple apples while maintaining good mobility. Enemy is moving toward (2,3) or (3,2), not threatening my immediate path. DOWN seems optimal: it keeps three safe exits next turn and progresses toward the apple cluster.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6,6), next turn consider moving LEFT to (5,6) or DOWN to (6,5) to approach apples (4,3) or (7,3). Monitor enemy movement; it may head toward (0,0) or up toward (3,6). Avoid boxing myself in the bottom-left corner; keep options to loop right toward (7,3) if needed.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Next turn from (6,5): UP (6,6) will be my body after this move (second segment), DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) empty, RIGHT (7,5) my body (eighth segment). Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT (two exits). Mobility reduced. Moves closer to apple (7,3) (distance from (6,5) to (7,3) = 1+2=3) and (4,3) (distance 2+2=4).\n\n**LEFT (5,6)**: Moves left. Next turn from (5,6): UP (5,7) my body (third segment), DOWN (5,5) empty, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) my body (second segment). Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT (two exits). Mobility reduced.

Next turn from (7,6): UP (7,7) my body (third segment), DOWN (7,5) my body (eighth segment), LEFT (6,6) my body (second segment), RIGHT (8,6) my body (sixth segment). **Only exit is RIGHT into (8,6) which is my own body (sixth segment) \u2192 dead end.** So RIGHT leads to zero safe exits next turn \u2014 very dangerous, likely to trap me.\n\nThus RIGHT is risky despite being safe this turn. I should avoid moves that severely limit future options.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apple to me is (7,3) at distance |6-7|+|6-3| = 1+3=4 from current head (6,6).  \n- Moving DOWN to (6,5) reduces distance to (7,3) to 3.  \n- Moving LEFT to (5,6) increases distance to (7,3) to 5.  \n- Moving RIGHT to (7,6) increases distance to (7,3) to 3 (but is too risky).\n\nApple (3,6) is at distance |6-3|+|6-6|=3+0=3.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): distance to (3,6) = 3+1=4.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): distance to (3,6) = 2+0=2.\n\nApple (4,3) is at distance |6-4|+|6-3|=2+3=5.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): distance = 2+2=4.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): distance = 1+3=4.\n\nApple (2,4) is at distance |6-2|+|6-4|=4+2=6.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): distance = 4+1=5.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): distance = 3+2=5.\n\nThus DOWN reduces distance to (7,3) and (4,3), while LEFT reduces distance to (3,6) and keeps similar distance to others.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nRIGHT is too dangerous (dead end next turn).  \nDOWN and LEFT both give two safe exits next turn.  \nEnemy is moving toward (2,4) (apple) or left/right, not threatening me immediately.  \nI have 9 apples vs enemy's 7 \u2014 I want to maintain lead and avoid risky traps.\n\nDOWN moves me toward the cluster of apples at (7,3) and (4,3), which are relatively uncontested (enemy is far left). LEFT moves me toward (3,6), but that apple is closer to enemy's possible path (enemy might go UP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3)).  \nGiven my lead, I should prioritize safety and gradual progress toward apples that enemy is less likely to reach soon. DOWN seems slightly better because it keeps me in a more open area (bottom half) and away from enemy's immediate vicinity.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6,5), next turn I'll have safe moves DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5). From there, I can aim for apple (7,3) by moving RIGHT later, or (4,3) by moving LEFT/DOWN. Monitor enemy; if it eats (2,4), it may grow and become more threatening. Avoid getting pinned against bottom edge; keep options to loop back up if needed.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Body after last move (DOWN from (6,6)): head now (6,5), body segments are [(6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5)] \u2014 length 9.  \nApples at: (3,6), (0,0), (4,3), (7,3), (7,6).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,4), body [(2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)], apples 8.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (6,6): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (6,4): Within board (0-9). Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (5,5): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,5): My own body (ninth segment). **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,5): Empty.\n- DOWN to (2,3): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (1,4): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,4), enemy cannot reach (6,4) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,5), enemy cannot reach (5,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**DOWN (6,4)**: Moves toward bottom. Next turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) will be my head's current cell (empty after move), DOWN (6,3) empty, LEFT (5,4) empty, RIGHT (7,4) empty. All four directions are empty! That gives **four safe exits** next turn \u2014 excellent mobility. Moves closer to apple (7,3) (distance from (6,4) to (7,3) = 1+1=2) and (4,3) (distance 2+1=3).\n\n**LEFT (5,5)**: Moves left. Next turn from (5,5): UP (5,6) my body (second segment), DOWN (5,4) empty, LEFT (4,5) empty, RIGHT (6,5) my body (first segment after move). Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT (two exits). Mobility reduced. Moves toward apple (3,6) (distance 2+1=3) and (4,3) (distance 1+2=3).\n\nThus DOWN offers far better future mobility (four exits vs two).\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apple to me is (7,3) at distance |6-7|+|5-3| = 1+2=3 from current head (6,5).  \n- Moving DOWN to (6,4) reduces distance to (7,3) to 2.  \n- Moving LEFT to (5,5) increases distance to (7,3) to 3.\n\nApple (4,3) is at distance |6-4|+|5-3|=2+2=4.  \n- DOWN to (6,4): distance = 2+1=3.  \n- LEFT to (5,5): distance = 1+2=3.\n\nApple (7,6) is at distance |6-7|+|5-6|=1+1=2.  \n- DOWN to (6,4): distance = 1+2=3.  \n- LEFT to (5,5): distance = 2+1=3.\n\nApple (3,6) is at distance |6-3|+|5-6|=3+1=4.  \n- DOWN to (6,4): distance = 3+2=5.  \n- LEFT to (5,5): distance = 2+1=3.\n\nThus DOWN improves proximity to (7,3) and (4,3), while LEFT improves proximity to (3,6). Given my lead (9 vs 8 apples), I should prioritize maintaining mobility and targeting apples that are safer and easier to reach without boxing myself.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nDOWN is clearly superior: it gives maximum future options and moves toward two apples (7,3) and (4,3) in the lower right, away from enemy's area. LEFT reduces mobility and moves toward (3,6), which is closer to enemy's possible path (enemy could move UP to (2,5) or RIGHT to (3,4) and then toward that apple). With my lead, I should avoid risky areas and keep open space.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6,4), I'll have four safe exits. Next turn I can choose to go RIGHT to (7,4) to approach apple (7,3), or DOWN to (6,3) to approach (4,3) or (7,3). Keep an eye on enemy's movement; if it eats apple (2,4) it will grow but is still far away. Avoid moving into corners prematurely. Maintain flexibility to loop around and collect multiple apples.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,5): Empty.\n- DOWN to (3,3): Empty.\n- LEFT to (2,4): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,3), enemy cannot reach (6,3) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,4), enemy cannot reach (5,4) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,4), enemy cannot reach (7,4) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**DOWN (6,3)**: Moves toward bottom. Next turn from (6,3): UP (6,4) will be my head's current cell (empty after move), DOWN (6,2) empty, LEFT (5,3) empty, RIGHT (7,3) contains apple (7,3) \u2014 moving onto apple is safe (eats and grows). All four directions are safe! That gives **four safe exits** next turn \u2014 excellent mobility. Moves directly toward apple (7,3) (distance from (6,4) to (7,3) = 1+1=2, moving DOWN reduces distance to 1+2=3? Wait: from (6,4) to (7,3) is |6-7|+|4-3|=1+1=2. Moving DOWN to (6,3) makes distance |6-7|+|3-3|=1+0=1 \u2014 actually closer! So DOWN puts me one step away from apple (7,3) horizontally. Also closer to apple (4,3) (distance from (6,3) to (4,3)=2+0=2).\n\n**LEFT (5,4)**: Moves left. Next turn from (5,4): UP (5,5) my body (second segment), DOWN (5,3) empty, LEFT (4,4) empty, RIGHT (6,4) my head's current cell (empty after move). Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good mobility. Moves toward apple (4,3) (distance 1+1=2) and (3,6) (distance 2+2=4).\n\n**RIGHT (7,4)**: Moves right. Next turn from (7,4): UP (7,5) my body (ninth segment), DOWN (7,3) contains apple (7,3) \u2014 safe (eat), LEFT (6,4) empty, RIGHT (8,4) empty. Safe exits: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good mobility. Moves toward apple (7,3) (distance 0+1=1) and (7,6) (distance 0+2=2).\n\nThus all three safe moves offer good future mobility (4, 3, 3 exits). DOWN gives the most exits next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,3) distance from (6,4) = 2. DOWN reduces to 1, RIGHT reduces to 1, LEFT increases to 3.\n- (4,3) distance from (6,4) = 2+1=3. DOWN reduces to 2, LEFT reduces to 2, RIGHT increases to 3+1=4.\n- (7,6) distance from (6,4) = 1+2=3. DOWN increases to 1+3=4, LEFT increases to 2+2=4, RIGHT reduces to 0+2=2.\n- (3,6) distance from (6,4) = 3+2=5. DOWN increases to 3+3=6, LEFT reduces to 2+2=4, RIGHT increases to 4+2=6.\n\nGiven my lead (9 vs 8), I should prioritize apples that are safe and keep options open. Apple (7,3) is very close and can be eaten next turn from either DOWN or RIGHT. Apple (4,3) is also close and can be targeted via LEFT or DOWN.\n\nEnemy is at (3,4) and might move toward apple (3,6) (UP) or (4,3) (RIGHT then DOWN). I should avoid moving into its path unnecessarily.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nDOWN offers the most future safe exits (4) and positions me to eat apple (7,3) next turn (by moving RIGHT) or apple (4,3) (by moving LEFT). It also keeps me central with open space below. RIGHT also positions for apple (7,3) but reduces exits slightly (3) and moves closer to right wall. LEFT moves toward enemy area and apple (4,3) but might risk future collision.\n\nGiven my lead, I prefer maximizing mobility and keeping distance from enemy while targeting apples efficiently. DOWN is optimal for flexibility.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6,3), I'll have four safe exits. Next turn I can go RIGHT to (7,3) to eat that apple, or LEFT toward (4,3), or DOWN to (6,2) to explore bottom. Monitor enemy's move; if it moves toward (4,3), I might choose to eat (7,3) first and loop around. Avoid boxing myself in corners; maintain open space to outmaneuver enemy.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Body after last move (DOWN from (6,4)): head now (6,3), body segments are [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5)] \u2014 length 10 (since I grew after eating an apple? Wait, I didn't eat an apple last turn. My apples collected is still 9. So length is 10? Actually my body list shows 10 segments including head: head (6,3) + 9 body segments = length 10. That matches starting length 10 (initial 1 + apples 9). Yes, length 10.\n\nApples at: (3,6), (0,0), (4,3), (7,3), (7,6).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (3,3), body [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1)], apples 8.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (6,4): My own body (second segment). **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (6,2): Within board (0-9). Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (5,3): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,3): Contains apple (7,3) \u2014 moving onto apple is safe (eat and grow). Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (3,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,4): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (3,2): Empty.\n- LEFT to (2,3): Its own body (fourth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Contains apple (4,3) \u2014 safe (eat).\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,2), enemy cannot reach (6,2) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,3), enemy cannot reach (5,3) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,3), enemy cannot reach (7,3) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**RIGHT (7,3)**: Eat apple (7,3). After eating, my length becomes 11. Next turn from (7,3): UP (7,4) empty, DOWN (7,2) empty, LEFT (6,3) my old head position (will be empty after move), RIGHT (8,3) empty. All four directions safe \u2192 **four safe exits**. Excellent mobility. Also positions near apple (7,6) above.\n\n**DOWN (6,2)**: No apple. Next turn from (6,2): UP (6,3) my old head position (empty after move), DOWN (6,1) empty, LEFT (5,2) empty, RIGHT (7,2) empty. All four directions safe \u2192 **four safe exits**. Good mobility, moves toward bottom-left area.\n\n**LEFT (5,3)**: No apple. Next turn from (5,3): UP (5,4) my body (third segment?), check: body list after moving LEFT: head (5,3), body segments: (6,3) old head, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5) \u2014 wait, that's 11 segments? Actually after moving LEFT without eating, length stays 10. The new body: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6) \u2014 tail (8,6) disappears. So (5,4) is empty. Let's verify: current body after last move: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5)]. After moving LEFT to (5,3), new body: head (5,3), then (6,3) old head, then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6) \u2014 tail (8,6) gone. So (5,4) is not in new body. Yes, (5,4) empty.  \nThus from (5,3): UP (5,4) empty, DOWN (5,2) empty, LEFT (4,3) contains apple (4,3) \u2014 safe (eat), RIGHT (6,3) empty. All four directions safe \u2192 **four safe exits**. Good mobility, moves toward apple (4,3).\n\nAll three safe moves give four safe exits next turn. That's great.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,3) distance from (6,3) = 1+0=1. RIGHT eats it immediately.\n- (4,3) distance from (6,3) = 2+0=2. LEFT reduces to 1 (next turn eat).\n- (7,6) distance from (6,3) = 1+3=4.\n- (3,6) distance from (6,3) = 3+3=6.\n- (0,0) distance from (6,3) = 6+3=9.\n\nEnemy is at (3,3) and can move RIGHT to (4,3) to eat that apple this turn. If enemy moves RIGHT, it will eat (4,3) and grow. I should consider competing for apples.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I eat (7,3) and gain a point (10 apples). Enemy might eat (4,3) and gain a point (9 apples). I maintain a 1-apple lead.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I move toward (4,3) but don't eat it this turn. If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), it eats it this turn and we might collide next turn if I move onto (4,3) while enemy is there? Actually, if enemy eats (4,3) this turn, its head will be at (4,3) and its body grows. Next turn, (4,3) will be part of enemy body, so moving LEFT then UP to (4,3) would kill me. So going LEFT risks losing that apple to enemy and possibly getting blocked.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I avoid competition but don't eat an apple this turn.\n\nGiven my lead (9 vs 8), securing an apple now is wise. RIGHT gives immediate apple with no risk of head-on collision (enemy can't reach (7,3)). It also keeps me away from enemy's probable path.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nRIGHT is the only move that eats an apple this turn, increasing my lead to 10 vs possibly 9 if enemy eats (4,3). It also gives maximum future mobility (four exits). It moves me toward the right side where there is another apple (7,6) and open space.\n\nLEFT risks losing the apple (4,3) to enemy and may bring me closer to enemy's body. DOWN is safe but delays eating.\n\nGiven the objective to collect apples and maintain lead, RIGHT is optimal.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After eating apple at (7,3), my length becomes 11. Next turn from (7,3), all four directions are safe. Consider moving UP toward apple (7,6) or LEFT/DOWN to explore open space. Monitor enemy's position; if enemy ate (4,3), it will be at (4,3) with length 9. Avoid moving into its path. Keep building lead and maintain mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

If I move LEFT to (6,3), that cell is currently occupied by my body's first segment. After the move, that segment will become my new head, but the old head (7,3) will become part of the body? Wait, careful: The body list is ordered head-to-tail. Currently head is (7,3). Body segments are the list starting at (6,3). So (6,3) is the first body segment. If I move LEFT to (6,3), I am moving into my own body's first segment. That is **immediate death** (collision with own body). So LEFT is **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,3): Within board. Empty.

So (6,4) is in new body (fourth segment). So LEFT (6,4) is unsafe. RIGHT (8,4) empty. So safe exits: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 **three safe exits**. Good mobility, moves toward apple (7,6) above.\n\n**DOWN (7,2)**: No apple. Next turn from (7,2): UP (7,3) empty, DOWN (7,1) empty, LEFT (6,2) empty, RIGHT (8,2) empty.

It might move toward apple (5,2) or (3,6). If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,3), it's closer to (5,2). If enemy moves UP to (4,4), it's closer to (3,6). I should consider competing for apples.\n\nUP moves toward (7,6) \u2014 no immediate competition.  \nDOWN moves toward (5,2) \u2014 possible competition with enemy.  \nRIGHT moves away from most apples but keeps open space.\n\nGiven my lead (10 vs 9), securing another apple soon is wise. UP gets me closer to (7,6) in 2 moves (UP, UP). DOWN gets me closer to (5,2) in 2 moves (DOWN, LEFT). RIGHT doesn't approach any apple directly.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nAll three safe moves have good future mobility (three or four exits). UP has only three exits next turn because LEFT is blocked by my own body, but that's acceptable.\n\nI prefer UP because it moves toward apple (7,6) which is uncontested (enemy far). It also keeps me in open area on the right side. DOWN risks moving into enemy's potential path toward (5,2). RIGHT moves away from apples.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving UP to (7,4), next turn consider UP again toward (7,5) then (7,6) to eat apple. Monitor enemy's position; if enemy moves toward (5,2), I can continue upward to collect (7,6) and then maybe (3,6) or (9,0). Maintain lead and avoid trapping myself.\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 10.  \nApples at: (3,6), (0,0), (7,6), (5,2), (9,0).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (4,2), body length 9, apples 9.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (7,5): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (7,3): Within board. Currently occupied by my body's second segment? Let's check current body: [(7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]. After moving last turn (UP from (7,3) to (7,4)), the tail shifted. Now head is (7,4), first body segment is (7,3). So moving DOWN to (7,3) would move into my own body's first segment \u2192 **immediate death**. DOWN is **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,4): Within board. Occupied by my body's third segment? Current body list: (7,3) is first, (6,3) is second, (6,4) is third. So (6,4) is my body \u2192 **immediate death**. LEFT is **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,4): Within board. Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (4,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,3): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (4,1): Empty.\n- LEFT to (3,2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,2): Apple at (5,2) \u2192 safe (eating apple grows, but collision check is before growth? Actually, if enemy moves into apple, it grows, but collision is checked before growth. So moving into apple is safe if cell is empty except for apple. Yes, apple is not a snake body, so safe.)\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (7,5), enemy cannot reach (7,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (8,4), enemy cannot reach (8,4) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (7,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (7,5): UP (7,6) has apple, DOWN (7,4) will be my body (old head becomes first segment), LEFT (6,5) my body (fourth segment), RIGHT (8,5) empty. So safe exits: UP (to apple), RIGHT \u2192 **two safe exits**. Mobility reduced, but UP leads directly to apple (7,6).\n\n**RIGHT (8,4)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,4): UP (8,5) empty, DOWN (8,3) empty, LEFT (7,4) will be my body (old head), RIGHT (9,4) empty. So safe exits: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 **three safe exits**. Good mobility, but moves away from immediate apples.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,6) distance from (7,4) = 0+2=2.\n- (5,2) distance = 2+2=4.\n- (3,6) distance = 4+2=6.\n- (9,0) distance = 2+4=6.\n- (0,0) distance = 7+4=11.\n\nEnemy is at (4,2). It might move toward apple (5,2) (RIGHT) or (0,0) (LEFT/DOWN). If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,2), it eats that apple and grows, tying apples at 10 each. I should secure an apple quickly to maintain lead.\n\nUP gets me to apple (7,6) in one move (next turn). RIGHT does not approach any apple directly.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering future mobility and apple strategy.**\n\nUP offers immediate apple next turn, though it reduces mobility to two exits (UP to apple, RIGHT). However, after eating apple at (7,6), my length increases to 11, and the tail extends, possibly opening more space. The apple at (7,6) is uncontested\u2014enemy is far.\n\nRIGHT keeps more options open but delays apple collection, allowing enemy to potentially tie or overtake if it eats (5,2) and maybe another.\n\nGiven my lead (10 vs 9), securing another apple quickly is wise to press advantage. UP is aggressive but safe and leads directly to apple.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving UP to (7,5), next turn move UP to (7,6) to eat apple. Then assess: from (7,6), possible moves will be limited (DOWN into body, LEFT into body, RIGHT maybe open, UP off-board). Might need to turn RIGHT toward (8,6) or (9,6) after eating to avoid trapping. Keep an eye on enemy's position and remaining apples.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (5,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,3): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (7,6), enemy cannot reach (7,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (8,5), enemy cannot reach (8,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (7,6)**: Apple present \u2192 I will eat it, grow to length 11, and gain an apple (score 11). After eating, the apple cell becomes my head. Next turn from (7,6):  \n  - UP to (7,7): Occupied by my body's eighth segment (7,7) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (7,5): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (6,6): Occupied by my body's sixth segment (6,6) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (8,6): Empty.  \n  So only one safe exit (RIGHT). This is a **deadly trap** unless the tail moves away next turn. However, after growth, the tail remains at (9,7) for one more turn (since growth adds a segment at the tail end after movement). So from (7,6), only RIGHT is safe, leading to (8,6). From (8,6), possible exits might open, but it's risky.\n\n**RIGHT (8,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,5):  \n  - UP to (8,6): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (8,4): Empty.  \n  - LEFT to (7,5): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (9,5): Empty.  \n  So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility. It moves me toward the right side where apple (9,0) is far below, but keeps options open.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,6) distance from (7,5) = 0+1=1 (UP).\n- (2,1) distance = 5+4=9.\n- (3,6) distance = 4+1=5.\n- (9,0) distance = 2+5=7.\n- (0,0) distance = 7+5=12.\n\nEnemy is at (5,2). It might move toward apple (2,1) or (3,6). If I take UP and eat (7,6), I gain a lead (11 vs 10). However, I risk trapping myself with only one exit next turn. If I take RIGHT, I maintain flexibility and can aim for (9,0) or (3,6) later, but enemy could eat (2,1) or (3,6) and tie or lead.\n\nGiven the trap risk of UP, RIGHT seems safer long-term. But recall the objective: avoid moves that kill you. UP does not kill me this turn, but it severely limits next turn's options, potentially leading to death on turn 39 if no escape appears. However, the tail might move: after growth, the tail stays at (9,7) this turn, then next turn when I move from (7,6) to (8,6), the tail will move from (9,7) to (8,7)? Let's simulate:  \nCurrent body: [(7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)] (length 11 after growth? Wait, I have 10 segments now. After moving UP and eating, I grow, so new length 11. The new tail segment will be added at the end after movement, so tail remains at (9,7) for this turn, and the segment before it is (8,7). Next turn, if I move from (7,6) to (8,6), the tail will move from (9,7) to (8,7) (since the snake moves forward, tail follows). So (7,7) might become free? Let's list body after UP move and growth:  \nHead moves to (7,6), old head (7,5) becomes first body segment, then (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), and tail stays (9,7) but new segment added at tail? Actually, growth means the tail does not move, so tail remains (9,7) and an extra segment is added at (9,7)? That doesn't make sense\u2014typically, growth adds a new segment at the tail position after the tail moves? Let's assume standard Snake mechanics: when you eat, you grow by not removing the tail segment on the next move. So after moving to (7,6) and eating, the tail stays at (9,7) for the next turn. Then when you move again, the tail moves to (8,7) (the previous segment), and length remains increased. So from (7,6), the only safe move is RIGHT to (8,6). Then from (8,6), possible moves: UP (8,7) will be occupied by tail? Actually, after moving to (8,6), the tail moves from (9,7) to (8,7), so (8,7) becomes the new tail. So from (8,6), UP to (8,7) is occupied by my own tail \u2192 unsafe. DOWN to (8,5) might be free? (8,5) was my previous head if I go RIGHT this turn? No, if I go RIGHT this turn to (8,5), then next turn from (8,5), that's a different scenario.  \n\nGiven the complexity, UP is risky because it leads to a position with only one exit next turn, and that exit might lead to another limited position. RIGHT offers more breathing room.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nUP gives an immediate apple and lead but risks trapping. RIGHT maintains mobility and allows me to maneuver toward other apples later. Since the enemy just ate an apple and tied the score, I need to be cautious but also proactive. However, survival is paramount. RIGHT keeps me alive with more options next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (8,5), assess exits and consider moving toward apple (9,0) via DOWN/RIGHT or apple (3,6) via LEFT/UP. Monitor enemy's movement\u2014it may go for (2,1) or (3,6). If possible, cut off enemy's path to apples while avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (5,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,2): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (5,0): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,1): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,1): Empty.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (8,6), enemy cannot reach (8,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (8,4), enemy cannot reach (8,4) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (9,5), enemy cannot reach (9,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (8,6)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,6):  \n  - UP to (8,7): Occupied by my body's ninth segment (8,7) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (8,5): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (7,6): Contains apple (7,6) \u2192 safe (apple not a body).  \n  - RIGHT to (9,6): Empty.  \n  So two safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility, and LEFT leads to an apple.\n\n**DOWN (8,4)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,4):  \n  - UP to (8,5): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (8,3): Empty.  \n  - LEFT to (7,4): Occupied by my body's second segment (7,4) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (9,4): Empty.  \n  So two safe exits (DOWN, RIGHT). Moves me away from most apples but opens space.\n\n**RIGHT (9,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (9,5):  \n  - UP to (9,6): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (9,4): Empty.  \n  - LEFT to (8,5): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (10,5): Off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So two safe exits (UP, DOWN). Puts me on the right edge, limiting future moves but keeps options toward apple (9,0) via DOWN later.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,6) distance from (8,5) = 1+1=2 (LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT).\n- (3,6) distance = 5+1=6.\n- (2,1) distance = 6+4=10.\n- (9,0) distance = 1+5=6.\n- (0,0) distance = 8+5=13.\n\nEnemy at (5,1) is close to apple (2,1) (distance 3+0=3) and apple (3,6) (distance 2+5=7). It will likely move toward (2,1) via DOWN or LEFT. If I go UP, I position myself to potentially take (7,6) next turn and then move toward (3,6) while enemy is lower. If I go RIGHT or DOWN, I move away from the nearest apples.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nAll three safe moves offer two exits next turn. UP seems best because:\n- It keeps me central and close to apple (7,6), which I can eat next turn via LEFT from (8,6).\n- It avoids the right edge trap and maintains flexibility.\n- Enemy is far away and unlikely to intercept.\n\nDOWN leads to less productive area. RIGHT puts me on the edge with fewer long-term options.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** From (8,6), consider moving LEFT to eat apple (7,6) if safe, then assess exits. Watch enemy movement\u2014if it moves toward (2,1), I can aim for (3,6) afterward. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body as tail moves.\n\nUP",

Occupied by my body's ninth segment (8,7) according to body list? Wait, my body list is: [(8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)]. The last segment is (7,7), not (8,7). Let's verify board: At (8,7) the board shows '.' (empty). So UP to (8,7) is empty \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN** to (8,5): Within board. Occupied by my body's first segment (8,5) \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (7,6): Within board. Contains apple (7,6) \u2192 safe (apple not a body).\n- **RIGHT** to (9,6): Within board. Empty \u2192 safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (4,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,2): Occupied by its own body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (4,0): Empty.\n- LEFT to (3,1): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,1): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (8,7), enemy cannot reach (8,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (7,6), enemy cannot reach (7,6) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (9,6), enemy cannot reach (9,6) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (8,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,7):  \n  - UP to (8,8): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (8,6): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (7,7): Occupied by my body's last segment (7,7) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (9,7): Empty.  \n  So two safe exits (UP, RIGHT). Moves me toward top edge but away from most apples.\n\n**LEFT (7,6)**: Contains apple \u2192 I will eat it, grow by 1 segment, and increase apple count to 11. Next turn from (7,6) after growth: My new body will be length 11, with head at (7,6), then old head (8,6) becomes first body segment, etc. Need to check future mobility after eating:  \n  - UP to (7,7): Occupied by my body's last segment (7,7) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (7,5): Occupied by my body's second segment (7,5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (6,6): Occupied by my body's eighth segment (6,6) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (8,6): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  **All four directions are blocked by my own body next turn if I eat the apple!** This is a trap\u2014eating (7,6) now leads to certain death next turn because my body surrounds the head. Must avoid.\n\n**RIGHT (9,6)**: No apple. Next turn from (9,6):  \n  - UP to (9,7): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (9,5): Empty.  \n  - LEFT to (8,6): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (10,6): Off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So two safe exits (UP, DOWN). Puts me on right edge but keeps options open.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (7,6) is adjacent but eating it is suicidal as analyzed.\n- (9,0) is far (distance from (8,6): 1+6=7).\n- (3,6) distance 5+0=5.\n- (2,1) distance 6+5=11.\n- (0,0) distance 8+6=14.\n\nEnemy at (4,1) is close to apple (2,1) (distance 2+0=2) and may move LEFT to (3,1) or DOWN to (4,0). It will likely go for (2,1) soon.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nLEFT is immediately fatal next turn, so must eliminate. Remaining safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nUP (8,7) gives two exits (UP, RIGHT) but moves away from apples and toward top edge. RIGHT (9,6) gives two exits (UP, DOWN) and keeps me near the right side, possibly allowing descent toward apple (9,0) later. Both are similarly safe in terms of immediate survival, but RIGHT may offer slightly better future apple access (downward path to (9,0)) and avoids moving into a potential corner at top-right too quickly.\n\nGiven that eating (7,6) is a death trap, I should avoid it and plan to lure enemy or wait for tail to move. My tail is at (7,7), which will move next turn as I advance, potentially opening space. From (9,6), I can go DOWN next turn to (9,5) and then possibly LEFT toward center later.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** From (9,6), consider DOWN to (9,5) to stay alive and move toward lower-right apples. Avoid (7,6) until my body clears. Watch enemy movement\u2014it may eat (2,1) soon. Aim to collect apples on right side (9,0) while staying safe.\n\nRIGHT",

That's my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (10,6): Off board (x=10 > 9) \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (3,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,2): Occupied by its own body? Enemy body: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]. (3,2) is not listed \u2192 empty (board shows '.' at (3,2)). So UP is safe.\n- DOWN to (3,0): Empty (board '.' at (3,0)).\n- LEFT to (2,1): Contains apple (2,1) \u2192 safe (apple not a body).\n- RIGHT to (4,1): Occupied by its own body (first segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (9,7), enemy cannot reach (9,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (9,5), enemy cannot reach (9,5) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (9,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (9,7):  \n  - UP to (9,8): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (9,6): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (8,7): Empty (board '.' at (8,7)).  \n  - RIGHT to (10,7): Off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So two safe exits (UP, LEFT). Moves me toward top edge.\n\n**DOWN (9,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (9,5):  \n  - UP to (9,6): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (9,4): Empty (board '.' at (9,4)).  \n  - LEFT to (8,5): Occupied by my body's second segment (8,5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (10,5): Off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So only one safe exit (DOWN). That's risky\u2014could lead to dead-end at bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (9,0) is below me at distance 6 (0 x-diff, 6 y-diff). DOWN moves toward it.\n- (7,6) is at (7,6) but eating it is currently blocked by my body (8,6) and would be dangerous as noted last turn.\n- (3,6) far.\n- (0,0) far.\n- (2,1) likely to be eaten by enemy soon (enemy may go LEFT to (2,1) this turn).\n\nEnemy may eat (2,1) and grow, increasing its length. My tail is at (6,7) and will move next turn as I advance, potentially opening space near (7,7) and (6,7).\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nDOWN (9,5) gives only one safe exit next turn (DOWN again), which could trap me along the right edge with limited options. UP (9,7) gives two exits (UP, LEFT), offering more flexibility. While DOWN moves toward apple (9,0), the immediate risk of having only one safe move next turn is high\u2014if I go DOWN to (9,5), then next turn I must go DOWN to (9,4), then possibly only DOWN again, leading to a corner.\n\nUP keeps me safer with more options. From (9,7), I can go LEFT to (8,7) next turn, moving toward center and possibly toward apples later. Also, my tail will move from (6,7) to (7,7) or (6,6)? Actually, when I move, my tail moves forward: the last segment (6,7) will become (7,7) if the snake moves? Wait, snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment's position. So tail (6,7) will move to (6,6) (since the segment before tail is (6,6)). That opens (6,7) eventually.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (9,7), then consider LEFT to (8,7) next turn to avoid getting trapped on edge. Monitor enemy movement\u2014if enemy eats (2,1), it will grow and its tail will stay put, possibly blocking its own path. Aim to collect apples on right side (9,0) later by descending safely after tail clears.\n\nUP",

It grew, so its tail will stay put for one more turn. Its safe moves are DOWN or LEFT, likely moving toward bottom-left.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nBoth UP and LEFT give two safe exits next turn. UP leads to top-right corner, which could become a trap if I go to (9,9) and then have only LEFT as an exit. LEFT moves me toward the center, which generally offers more future mobility. From (8,7), I can go LEFT to (7,7) next turn, moving closer to the apple at (7,6) once my body clears. Also, moving LEFT keeps me away from the edge, reducing risk of being cornered.\n\nGiven that enemy is on the left side and not an immediate threat, I prefer to move toward the center to maintain options and eventually target the apple at (7,6) when safe.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,7), consider moving LEFT to (7,7) if safe, to continue toward the center and approach the apple at (7,6). Monitor enemy movement and ensure my tail movement opens up space. Avoid getting trapped near edges.\n\nLEFT",

That's my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,1): Occupied by its own body? Enemy body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)].

Next turn from (8,8):  \n  - UP to (8,9): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (8,7): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (7,8): Empty (board '.' at (7,8)).  \n  - RIGHT to (9,8): Empty (board '.' at (9,8)).  \n  So three safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Moves me toward top edge but not corner yet.\n\n**LEFT (7,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (7,7):  \n  - UP to (7,8): Empty.  \n  - DOWN to (7,6): Occupied by apple at (7,6) \u2014 eating apple is safe (apple cell is not a body).  \n  - LEFT to (6,7): Empty (board '.' at (6,7)).  \n  - RIGHT to (8,7): Will be my body's first segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Moves me toward center and puts apple (7,6) directly below me next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (7,6) is very close and reachable next turn if I move LEFT now (to (7,7)), then DOWN to (7,6) next turn. That apple is not in enemy's immediate path (enemy is far left). My tail is at (6,5) and will move to (6,4) next turn, freeing (6,5). The path to (7,6) is clear: my body currently occupies (8,6) and (9,6), but moving LEFT to (7,7) avoids those. Next turn, my head at (7,7) can go DOWN to (7,6) to eat the apple safely (no body there at that time, as my tail will have moved).\n\nOther apples are far. Enemy is moving LEFT or RIGHT, likely staying in lower-left area.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nBoth moves are safe and offer good future mobility. LEFT to (7,7) is strategically superior because it positions me to eat the apple at (7,6) next turn, increasing my score and length. Eating an apple also gives me a growth advantage and opens more space as my tail doesn't move that turn. UP to (8,8) moves away from the nearest apple and offers no immediate scoring opportunity.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,7), plan to go DOWN to (7,6) to eat the apple, provided it remains safe (check for enemy head-on collision risk then). Monitor enemy movement; if enemy somehow approaches, reassess. Continue to favor moves that keep multiple exits and target apples while avoiding traps.\n\nLEFT",

The old tail (6,4) stays, and the segment before it (6,3) becomes second-to-last. So body list: head (7,6), then (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4) \u2014 that's 12? Let's recount: original body length 10 means 10 coordinates total. After growth, we add one new head, and keep all old segments, so total 11 coordinates. My earlier list had 11 old segments? Let's list current body correctly:  \nCurrent: head (7,7), body segments: (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4) \u2014 that's 10 total (head + 9 segments). After moving DOWN to (7,6) and eating apple: new head (7,6), then old head (7,7) becomes segment 2, then the rest shift: (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), and tail (6,4) stays. So next turn from (7,6), adjacent cells:  \n  - UP (7,7): occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN (7,5): occupied by my body (segment 7? Actually (7,5) is segment 7 in new order) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT (6,6): empty (board '.' at (6,6)).  \n  - RIGHT (8,6): occupied by my body (segment 6) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only LEFT would be safe next turn \u2014 that's a potential trap (only one exit). However, eating the apple is valuable for score and growth. Could be risky if enemy approaches, but enemy is far.\n\n**UP (7,8)**: No apple. Next turn from (7,8):  \n  - UP to (7,9): empty.  \n  - DOWN to (7,7): will be my body's second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (6,8): empty.  \n  - RIGHT to (8,8): empty.  \nSo three safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n**LEFT (6,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (6,7):  \n  - UP to (6,8): empty.  \n  - DOWN to (6,6): empty.  \n  - LEFT to (5,7): empty.  \n  - RIGHT to (7,7): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Also good mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (7,6) is directly below me. Eating it now ties the apple score with enemy (11 each). However, it reduces my next-turn safe moves to only LEFT, which could be dangerous if enemy moves toward me. Enemy is at (1,0) and likely to move UP to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,0) (apple). It's far away, so immediate danger low. Other apples: (3,6) is closer to enemy, (3,8) is near top-left, (9,0) far bottom-right.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nDOWN (eat apple) gives immediate score gain but severely limits next move options (only LEFT). That could lead to being trapped if enemy approaches. UP and LEFT both maintain high mobility and keep me safe. Since enemy is distant, I could eat the apple now and still have a safe path leftward next turn, but I must ensure I don't box myself in later.\n\nGiven the objective to stay alive and maximize apples, eating the apple is tempting, but safety first. Since I have a safe move (LEFT) that keeps me mobile and also positions me to possibly eat the apple later? Actually if I move LEFT to (6,7), the apple at (7,6) is still adjacent (DOWN from (6,7) is (6,6), not directly). I could go DOWN next turn to (6,6), then RIGHT to (7,6) in two turns, but apple might be taken by then? Only enemy could take it, but enemy is far.\n\nGiven the risk of reducing mobility to one exit after eating, I prefer to maintain options. UP or LEFT are both good. LEFT moves me toward center and away from top edge, which might be better for long-term mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,7), I'll have three safe exits. I can then consider moving toward apple (7,6) via DOWN then RIGHT, or target other apples. Monitor enemy movement; if enemy moves toward my area, avoid head-on collisions. Continue to prioritize keeping at least two safe moves each turn.\n\nLEFT",

Its possible moves:\n- UP to (0,1): Board shows '.' at (0,1). Enemy body: [(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)].

Next turn from (6,8):\n  - UP to (6,9): empty.\n  - DOWN to (6,7): will be my body's second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (5,8): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (7,8): empty.\nSo three safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).

Good mobility, and positions me to potentially eat the apple at (7,6) next turn via RIGHT.\n\n**LEFT (5,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (5,7):\n  - UP to (5,8): empty.\n  - DOWN to (5,6): empty.\n  - LEFT to (4,7): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (6,7): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\nSo three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility, but moves me away from the nearest apple (7,6).\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (7,6) is one step RIGHT from my current head if I were allowed, but RIGHT is unsafe. Moving DOWN to (6,6) puts me adjacent to the apple (RIGHT from (6,6) is (7,6)). That's the closest I can get this turn. Enemy is moving UP to (0,1), far away. Other apples: (3,6) and (3,8) are closer to enemy's area, (1,9) top-left, (9,0) bottom-right.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nAll three safe moves offer good mobility. DOWN (6,6) is strategically best because it positions me to eat the apple at (7,6) next turn (via RIGHT), which would tie my apple count with the enemy (11 each) and increase my length. It also keeps three safe exits for the next turn, so I'm not trapped. UP and LEFT are safe but don't advance toward an apple as directly.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,6), I plan to move RIGHT to (7,6) to eat the apple, provided it's still there and safe. Check enemy movement; they are distant. After eating, my length grows to 11, and my tail remains, so my body will extend. Ensure I have safe exits after eating; from (7,6) after growth, my body will occupy (6,6) as second segment, so UP/DOWN/LEFT from (7,6) need checking. Likely only RIGHT or other directions may be safe, but I'll assess next turn. For now, moving DOWN sets up that opportunity.\n\nDOWN",

(0,2) is empty.\n- DOWN to (0,0): Occupied by its own body (first segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (-1,1): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1,1): Board shows '.' at (1,1). Enemy body: none at (1,1). \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP to (0,2) and RIGHT to (1,1).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,5), enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,6), enemy cannot reach (5,6) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,6), enemy cannot reach (7,6) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**RIGHT (7,6)**: Eat apple \u2192 length grows to 11, apple count 11. After eating, my body will extend: new head at (7,6), old head (6,6) becomes second segment, tail stays. Next turn from (7,6):\n  - UP to (7,7): currently my body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (7,5): currently my body (eighth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (6,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (8,6): currently my body (sixth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\nAll four directions are occupied by my own body next turn \u2192 **TRAPPED, certain death next turn**. Therefore, RIGHT is **unsafe for future survival** and should be eliminated.\n\n**DOWN (6,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (6,5):\n  - UP to (6,6): will be my body's second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (6,4): empty.\n  - LEFT to (5,5): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (7,5): currently my body (eighth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\nSo two safe exits (DOWN, LEFT). Moderate mobility.\n\n**LEFT (5,6)**: No apple. Next turn from (5,6):\n  - UP to (5,7): empty.\n  - DOWN to (5,5): empty.\n  - LEFT to (4,6): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (6,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\nSo three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (7,6) is adjacent but eating it now leads to immediate trap next turn. Other apples: (3,6) is three steps left, (3,8) is up-left, (1,9) far top-left, (9,0) far bottom-right. Enemy is moving toward top-left area. Moving LEFT (5,6) gets me closer to (3,6) and (3,8) while maintaining mobility. DOWN (6,5) moves me away from most apples.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nRIGHT is suicidal next turn, so discard. DOWN offers only two safe exits and moves away from apples. LEFT offers three safe exits and moves toward two apples while keeping distance from enemy. It's the safest and most strategic choice.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,6), I'll aim to move toward apple at (3,6) or (3,8) while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid moving into my own body as it shifts. Keep evaluating mobility each turn.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 10.\nApples at: (3,6), (7,6), (9,0), (3,8), (1,9).\nEnemy snake #1 head at (0,2), body length 12, apples 12.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (5,7): Within board (0-9). Board shows '.' at (5,7). My body: none at (5,7). Enemy body: none at (5,7). \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (5,5): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,5). My body: none at (5,5). Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (4,6): Within board. Board shows '.' at (4,6). My body: none at (4,6). Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,6): Within board. Board shows '0' at (6,6) (my body's second segment from last turn). That's my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (0,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (0,3): Board shows '.' at (0,3). Enemy body: none at (0,3).\n- DOWN to (0,1): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (-1,2): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1,2): Board shows '.' at (1,2). Enemy body: none at (1,2).\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP to (0,3) and RIGHT to (1,2).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (5,7), enemy cannot reach (5,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (5,5), enemy cannot reach (5,5) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (4,6), enemy cannot reach (4,6) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (5,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (5,7):\n  - UP to (5,8): empty.\n  - DOWN to (5,6): will be my body's second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (4,7): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (6,7): currently my body's third segment \u2192 unsafe.\nSo two safe exits (UP, LEFT). Moderate mobility. Moves me toward apple at (3,8) (two steps up-left).\n\n**DOWN (5,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (5,5):\n  - UP to (5,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (5,4): empty.\n  - LEFT to (4,5): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (6,5): currently my body's eighth segment \u2192 unsafe.\nSo two safe exits (DOWN, LEFT). Moderate mobility. Moves me away from most apples.\n\n**LEFT (4,6)**: No apple. Next turn from (4,6):\n  - UP to (4,7): empty.\n  - DOWN to (4,5): empty.\n  - LEFT to (3,6): apple at (3,6) \u2192 eating possible.\n  - RIGHT to (5,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\nSo three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility. Moves me directly toward apple at (3,6) (one step left next turn).\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (3,6) is two steps away via LEFT now then LEFT again. Apple at (3,8) is three steps away (UP then LEFT then UP). Enemy is moving in top-left corner but currently far (head at (0,2)). Moving LEFT positions me best to grab (3,6) next turn while keeping multiple exits. UP also moves toward (3,8) but with fewer exits. DOWN moves away from apples.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nLEFT offers the best mobility (three safe exits) and directly sets up eating apple (3,6) next turn if still safe. UP is acceptable but with fewer exits. DOWN is less desirable (away from apples). Given my apple deficit (10 vs 12), I need to collect apples while maintaining safety. LEFT is optimal.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,6), aim to eat apple at (3,6) if safe (check enemy moves and self-collision). If not safe, use UP/DOWN exits to maintain mobility and loop toward (3,8) or (1,9). Monitor enemy's movement toward top-left; avoid getting cornered.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 48:**\n\nMy snake head at (4,6). Body length 10 (head + 9 segments). Apples collected: 10.\nApples at: (3,6), (7,6), (9,0), (3,8), (1,9).\nEnemy snake #1 head at (0,3), body length 12, apples 12.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death (board bounds, self-body, enemy body):**\n\n- **UP** to (4,7): Within board (0-9). Board shows '.' at (4,7). My body: none at (4,7). Enemy body: none at (4,7). \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (4,5): Within board. Board shows '.' at (4,5). My body: none at (4,5). Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (3,6): Within board. Board shows 'A' at (3,6) (apple). My body: none at (3,6). Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE** (and would eat apple).\n- **RIGHT** to (5,6): Within board. Board shows '0' at (5,6) (my body's second segment). That's my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (0,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (0,4): Board shows '.' at (0,4). Enemy body: none.\n- DOWN to (0,2): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (-1,3): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1,3): Board shows '.' at (1,3). Enemy body: none.\n\nThus enemy's safe moves are UP to (0,4) and RIGHT to (1,3).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (4,7), enemy cannot reach (4,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,5), enemy cannot reach (4,5) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (3,6), enemy cannot reach (3,6) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**LEFT (3,6)**: Apple present \u2192 eating would grow to length 11, gain 1 apple (now 11 vs enemy 12). Next turn from (3,6) after growth (new tail added at end, body shifts):\n  - UP to (3,7): empty.\n  - DOWN to (3,5): empty.\n  - LEFT to (2,6): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (4,6): will be my body's second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\nSo three safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Excellent mobility. Eating apple closes gap to enemy score.\n\n**UP (4,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (4,7):\n  - UP to (4,8): empty.\n  - DOWN to (4,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (3,7): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (5,7): empty (but currently my body's third segment will have moved? Actually body at (6,7) will shift; (5,7) will be free). Wait, careful: My current body: head (4,6), then (5,6),(6,6),(6,7),(7,7)... After moving UP to (4,7), the segment at (5,6) becomes new second segment, (6,6) third, etc. So (5,7) is currently empty and will remain empty next turn. So RIGHT to (5,7) is safe.\nThus three safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility. Moves toward apple at (3,8).\n\n**DOWN (4,5)**: No apple. Next turn from (4,5):\n  - UP to (4,6): will be my body's second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (4,4): empty.\n  - LEFT to (3,5): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (5,5): empty (currently my body's eighth segment at (7,5) will shift; (5,5) is free). So three safe exits (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility but moves away from most apples.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (3,6) is one step LEFT. Eating it now is highly advantageous\u2014reduces apple deficit to 1. Enemy is moving in top-left corner but not threatening that apple this turn. Apple at (3,8) is two steps away (UP then LEFT). Apple at (1,9) is farther. Apple at (7,6) is three steps away (RIGHT then UP then LEFT? but RIGHT is unsafe now). Apple at (9,0) is far.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nLEFT to eat apple (3,6) is clearly best: it gains an apple, gives excellent mobility (three exits), and positions me well to then go UP toward (3,8) or DOWN/LEFT to avoid enemy. UP is also safe with good mobility but misses immediate apple. DOWN is safe but less productive.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,6), from new head at (3,6) with length 11, assess safety. Likely move UP toward (3,8) if safe, or LEFT/DOWN to open space. Monitor enemy movement; it may be heading up the left column toward (0,4) and possibly (0,5+). Keep a path open to right side if needed.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 11.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (3,8), (1,9), (5,0).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (0,5), body length 12, apples 12.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction:**\n\n- **UP** to (3,8): Within board. Apple present at (3,8). My body: none at (3,8). Enemy body: none at (3,8). \u2192 **SAFE** (eating apple will grow next turn).\n- **DOWN** to (3,6): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s second segment) at (3,6). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (2,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (2,7). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (4,7). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (0,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (0,6): Board shows '.' at (0,6). Enemy body: none.\n- DOWN to (0,4): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (-1,5): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1,5): Board shows '.' at (1,5). Enemy body: none.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (0,6) and RIGHT to (1,5).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (3,8), enemy cannot reach (3,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (2,7), enemy cannot reach (2,7) \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (4,7), enemy cannot reach (4,7) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (3,8)**: Apple at (3,8). Eating it will increase my length to 12 and tie the apple count (12 vs 12). After eating, my tail stays in place, so my body will occupy (3,8) as new head, and the old tail (8,5) will remain. Next turn from (3,8):\n  - UP to (3,9): Within board, empty.\n  - DOWN to (3,7): Will be my body\u2019s second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (2,8): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (4,8): Empty.\nSo three safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility and immediate score gain.\n\n**LEFT (2,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (2,7):\n  - UP to (2,8): Empty.\n  - DOWN to (2,6): Empty.\n  - LEFT to (1,7): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (3,7): Will be my body\u2019s second segment \u2192 unsafe.\nThree safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Moves away from the apple at (3,8) and toward left side, closer to enemy but not immediately dangerous.\n\n**RIGHT (4,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (4,7):\n  - UP to (4,8): Empty.\n  - DOWN to (4,6): Occupied by my body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (3,7): Will be my body\u2019s second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (5,7): Empty.\nOnly two safe exits (UP, RIGHT). This reduces future options and moves toward the right where my body is coiled.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple at (3,8) is directly reachable this turn. Eating it ties the score and puts me in a strong position. Enemy is far away in the top-left corner and cannot intercept. Other apples are farther: (7,6) is four steps away, (1,9) is far, (9,0) and (5,0) are far. Securing (3,8) is the highest-value immediate move.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nUP is clearly best: it captures an apple, ties the score, and maintains good mobility. LEFT and RIGHT are safe but less productive, with RIGHT offering fewer future safe moves.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (3,8) and eating the apple, my length becomes 12 (same as enemy). Next turn, from (3,8), prioritize safety and consider moving toward the next nearest apple (likely (7,6) or (1,9)) while avoiding the enemy\u2019s possible advance. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position\u2014it may move toward (1,9) as well, so be prepared to compete or avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 12.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (1,9), (5,0), (2,4).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (1,6), body length 12, apples 12.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction:**\n\n- **UP** to (2,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (2,9). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (2,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (2,7). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (1,8): Within board. Board shows '.' at (1,8). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s second segment) at (3,8). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (1,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (1,7): Board shows '.' at (1,7). Enemy body: none.\n- DOWN to (1,5): Board shows '.' at (1,5). Enemy body: none.\n- LEFT to (0,6): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (2,6): Board shows '.' at (2,6). Enemy body: none.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), RIGHT to (2,6).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go UP to (2,9), enemy cannot reach (2,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (2,7), enemy could move UP to (1,7) \u2192 not same cell. Enemy could move RIGHT to (2,6) \u2192 not same cell. No head-on collision.\n- If I go LEFT to (1,8), enemy could move UP to (1,7) \u2192 not same cell. Enemy could move RIGHT to (2,6) \u2192 not same cell. No head-on collision.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**UP (2,9)**: No apple. Next turn from (2,9):\n  - UP to (2,10): Off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (2,8): Will be my body\u2019s second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (1,9): Apple at (1,9)! But need to check safety next turn.\n  - RIGHT to (3,9): Empty.\nOnly two safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT). Moves to top edge, reduces options. However, puts apple (1,9) one step away via LEFT next turn.\n\n**DOWN (2,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (2,7):\n  - UP to (2,8): Will be my body\u2019s second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (2,6): Empty.\n  - LEFT to (1,7): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (3,7): Occupied by my body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\nTwo safe exits (DOWN, LEFT). Moves away from top apples, toward center.\n\n**LEFT (1,8)**: No apple. Next turn from (1,8):\n  - UP to (1,9): Apple at (1,9)! But need to check safety.\n  - DOWN to (1,7): Empty.\n  - LEFT to (0,8): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (2,8): Will be my body\u2019s second segment \u2192 unsafe.\nThree safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Moves directly adjacent to apple (1,9) and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApple (1,9) is the closest high-value target. Enemy is at (1,6). Enemy\u2019s safe moves include UP to (1,7). If enemy moves UP to (1,7), it will be two steps from (1,9) (needs UP again to (1,8), then UP to (1,9)). If I move LEFT to (1,8), I am one step from (1,9) and can potentially take it next turn before enemy. However, if enemy moves UP to (1,7) and I move LEFT to (1,8), we are adjacent but not colliding. Next turn, if I go UP to (1,9) and enemy goes UP to (1,8), we would head-on collide at (1,9)? Wait: simultaneous moves. If enemy is at (1,7) and I am at (1,8), and we both move UP, enemy goes to (1,8) and I go to (1,9) \u2014 different cells, no collision. But if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,6) or DOWN to (1,5), it\u2019s less threatening.\n\nMoving UP to (2,9) also puts me one step from (1,9) via LEFT next turn, but with fewer safe exits.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nLEFT offers three safe exits next turn and positions me best to contest apple (1,9). UP offers only two safe exits and puts me on the edge. DOWN moves away from the apple and offers only two safe exits.\n\nI prefer LEFT because:\n- Maximizes future mobility (three exits).\n- Puts me adjacent to apple (1,9) with a clear path to take it next turn if safe.\n- Avoids moving into a corner (UP to edge).\n- Enemy is not in immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1,8), assess safety. If apple (1,9) is still present and moving UP to (1,9) is safe (no enemy head moving there simultaneously), take it. Otherwise, consider DOWN to (1,7) or LEFT to (0,8) to avoid danger and target other apples like (2,4) or (7,6). Monitor enemy\u2019s new position.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy is at (2,6) and cannot reach (1,9) this turn. However, after I eat it, I\u2019ll be at (1,9) with only two safe exits next turn, potentially vulnerable if enemy moves toward (2,8) or (2,7) and blocks my exits. But enemy\u2019s safe moves are only UP/DOWN, so it likely stays in column 2.\n\nOther apples: (2,4) is three steps away, (7,6) far, (9,0) and (5,0) far. Taking (1,9) now is efficient.\n\n**Step 5: Decision considering safety and future options.**\n\nUP (eat apple) is safe and gives me the lead. The reduced mobility next turn is a concern, but I can plan to move LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9) depending on enemy position. Since enemy is in column 2, moving RIGHT to (2,9) might be safer (away from enemy). Also, eating apple grows my tail, which may block enemy paths later.\n\nDOWN and LEFT offer no immediate reward and similar limited exits. UP gives a point and maintains parity or lead.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (1,9) and eating apple, assess safety. Likely move LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9) to avoid being trapped on edge. Monitor enemy\u2019s new head position. If enemy moves UP to (2,7), then (2,9) might be safer. If enemy moves DOWN to (2,5), then either exit is okay. Prioritize keeping distance from enemy head.\n\n**Final choice:** UP to eat apple and take lead.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 54:**\n\nMy snake head at (1,9). Body length 13 (head + 12 segments). Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (5,0), (2,4), (2,3).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,5), body length 12, apples 12.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction:**\n\n- **UP** to (1,10): Off board (y=10 > 9) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (1,8): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s second segment) at (1,8). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (0,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (0,9). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (2,9). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,6): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (2,4): Apple present. My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT to (1,5): Board shows '.' at (1,5). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Board shows '.' at (3,5). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), RIGHT to (3,5).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- If I go LEFT to (0,9), enemy cannot reach (0,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,9), enemy cannot reach (2,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for strategy and future mobility.**\n\n**LEFT (0,9)**: No apple. Next turn from (0,9):\n  - UP: off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (0,8): Empty.\n  - LEFT: off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (1,9): Will be my body\u2019s second segment (old head) \u2192 unsafe.\nOnly one safe exit (DOWN). That\u2019s a dead-end next turn unless I can move DOWN and then have more options. This is very risky\u2014if I go LEFT, I\u2019ll be trapped on the top-left corner with only one escape.\n\n**RIGHT (2,9)**: No apple. Next turn from (2,9):\n  - UP: off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN to (2,8): Occupied by my body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT to (1,9): Will be my body\u2019s second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,9): Empty.\nOnly one safe exit (RIGHT). That\u2019s also a dead-end, but moving RIGHT to (3,9) gives me a chance to then go DOWN to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,9) depending on board state. However, (3,8) is currently my body (fourth segment), but next turn that segment will have moved? Actually, after I move, my body shifts: the tail at (9,6) will move forward if I don\u2019t eat an apple. So (3,8) might become free? Let\u2019s simulate: if I move RIGHT to (2,9), my body shifts: head becomes (2,9), segment 2 becomes (1,9), segment 3 becomes (1,8), segment 4 becomes (2,8), segment 5 becomes (3,8), etc. So (3,8) will still be occupied by my body (segment 5). So from (2,9), only RIGHT to (3,9) is safe. That\u2019s still a trap.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT lead to only one safe exit next turn. That\u2019s dangerous.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate safety of DOWN and UP given body movement.**\n\nBecause my body shifts each turn (since I didn\u2019t eat an apple last turn\u2014I ate an apple on turn 53, so my tail will not move this turn? Wait: I ate an apple at (1,9) on turn 53, so my length increased from 12 to 13. That means on turn 54, my tail stays at (9,6) (does not move). So my body segments remain in place except the head moves. Thus:\n- DOWN to (1,8) is occupied by my body segment 2 (old head) \u2192 still unsafe.\n- UP is off board.\nSo indeed only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\nBut after I move, my body will shift: if I move LEFT to (0,9), new body: head (0,9), segment 2 (1,9), segment 3 (1,8), segment 4 (2,8), etc. So next turn, from (0,9), DOWN to (0,8) is empty (since (0,8) is currently '.' and will remain empty unless enemy moves there). That\u2019s the only safe move. That\u2019s a precarious position.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,9), new body: head (2,9), segment 2 (1,9), segment 3 (1,8), segment 4 (2,8), segment 5 (3,8), etc. So next turn, from (2,9), RIGHT to (3,9) is empty. That\u2019s the only safe move.\n\nThus both options are equally risky in terms of immediate next-turn mobility.\n\n**Step 5: Consider apple proximity and enemy path.**\n\nApples: (2,4) and (2,3) are close to enemy head (2,5). Enemy may move DOWN to (2,4) to eat apple, growing to length 13 (tying my length). That\u2019s neutral.\n\nMy moves LEFT or RIGHT don\u2019t get me closer to any apple quickly. The nearest apple to (0,9) is (5,0) or (9,0) far. To (2,9), nearest apple is (7,6) far.\n\nBut more importantly: I need to avoid being trapped. Between LEFT and RIGHT, which gives better future options after the forced move next turn?\n\n- If I go LEFT to (0,9), then forced DOWN to (0,8) next turn. From (0,8), possible moves: UP to (0,9) will be my body, DOWN to (0,7) empty, LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,8) my body. So only DOWN to (0,7) safe. That\u2019s a long narrow path along left edge\u2014very restrictive.\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,9), then forced RIGHT to (3,9) next turn. From (3,9), possible moves: UP off board, DOWN to (3,8) my body, LEFT to (2,9) my body, RIGHT to (4,9) empty. So only RIGHT to (4,9) safe. That leads me along top edge toward right side, where apple (7,6) is closer eventually.\n\nThus RIGHT seems slightly better because it moves me toward the right side where there\u2019s more open space and an apple at (7,6). Also, enemy is on left side (column 2), so moving right creates distance.\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan note for next turn.**\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,9), next turn I must move RIGHT to (3,9). Then from (3,9), only RIGHT to (4,9) is safe. That continues top edge. I need to plan an escape from the top edge\u2014perhaps after (4,9), I can go DOWN to (4,8) if it\u2019s free (currently '.'), but that depends on my body shifting. My body segment at (4,6) will move to (4,7)? Actually, my body shifts each turn, so by turn 56, (4,8) might be free. I\u2019ll need to check next turn.\n\nAlternative: Could I move LEFT to (0,9) and then DOWN to (0,8) and then DOWN to (0,7) and then RIGHT to (1,7) etc.? That\u2019s possible but very constrained.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s position, moving RIGHT seems to keep me away from enemy and gradually work toward apple (7,6).\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (2,9) is the better choice to maintain distance from enemy and eventually reach open space/apple.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,9), I\u2019ll be forced to move RIGHT to (3,9) next turn. Then assess if DOWN from (3,9) becomes safe as my body moves. If not, continue RIGHT along top edge while monitoring enemy. Goal: eventually descend toward apple (7,6) when safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy cannot reach (3,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate future mobility after RIGHT (3,9).**\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,9), my body shifts: head becomes (3,9), segment 2 becomes (2,9), segment 3 becomes (1,9), segment 4 becomes (1,8), segment 5 becomes (2,8), segment 6 becomes (3,8), etc.\n\nNext turn from (3,9), possible moves:\n- UP: off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (3,8): Occupied by my body (segment 6) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (2,9): Occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (4,9): Empty (currently '.').\n\nThus only RIGHT to (4,9) will be safe next turn. That\u2019s a forced move along the top edge.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan note for next turn.**\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,9), next turn I must move RIGHT to (4,9). Then from (4,9), possible moves will be:\n- UP: off board.\n- DOWN to (4,8): Currently '.' and will likely be free (my body segment at (4,6) will shift to (4,7)? Let\u2019s simulate: after turn 55, my body segment at (4,6) becomes (4,7) because the tail at (9,7) moves forward? Wait, I did not eat an apple this turn, so my tail (last segment at (9,7)) will move forward to (8,7)? Actually, my body list shows tail at (9,7). After moving head to (3,9), the tail will shift: the segment before tail (8,7) becomes new tail? Let\u2019s be precise: my body length is 13, I\u2019m not eating an apple this turn, so the tail (last coordinate) will be removed and the head moves to (3,9). The new body will be: head (3,9), then (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7). So (4,8) is free. So from (4,9) next turn, DOWN to (4,8) might be safe. That would give an escape from the top edge.\n\nThus the plan:  \nTurn 55: RIGHT to (3,9).  \nTurn 56: RIGHT to (4,9) (only safe move).  \nTurn 57: Hopefully DOWN to (4,8) to enter more open space and move toward apple (7,6).\n\nI must be cautious of enemy movements. Enemy is on left side and may eat apple at (2,3), growing to length 14. That could pressure me, but I\u2019m moving away.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the only safe move. I must take it and hope to escape the top edge next turn.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,9), next turn I\u2019ll be forced to move RIGHT to (4,9). Then assess if DOWN from (4,9) becomes safe. If so, take DOWN to (4,8) to open up options. If not, continue RIGHT along top edge while monitoring enemy. Goal: descend toward apple (7,6) when safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (5,0), (8,9), (3,0).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,3), body length 14 (it ate the apple at (2,3) last turn), apples 14.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction from (3,9):**\n\n- **UP** to (3,10): Off board (y=10 > 9) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (3,8): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s sixth segment) at (3,8). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (2,9): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s second segment) at (2,9). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (4,9). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nOnly one safe move: RIGHT to (4,9). This matches my forced move from last turn's plan.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (2,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,4): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (2,2): Board shows '.' at (2,2). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Board shows '.' at (1,3). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Board shows '.' at (3,3). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe move:\n- I go RIGHT to (4,9). Enemy cannot reach (4,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate future mobility after RIGHT (4,9).**\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4,9), my body shifts: head becomes (4,9), segment 2 becomes (3,9), segment 3 becomes (2,9), segment 4 becomes (1,9), segment 5 becomes (1,8), segment 6 becomes (2,8), segment 7 becomes (3,8), segment 8 becomes (3,7), segment 9 becomes (3,6), segment 10 becomes (4,6), segment 11 becomes (5,6), segment 12 becomes (6,6), segment 13 becomes (6,7). Tail is now at (6,7).\n\nNext turn from (4,9), possible moves:\n- UP: off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (4,8): Within board. Currently '.' and will be free (my body at (4,6) will shift to (4,7) after this move, so (4,8) is empty). \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- LEFT to (3,9): Occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (5,9): Within board. Currently '.' and will be free (no body there). \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nThus after this move, I will have two safe moves next turn: DOWN to (4,8) and RIGHT to (5,9). That's a much better position than being forced along the top edge.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan.**\n\nFrom (4,9), I should choose a move next turn that opens more options and moves toward an apple. The closest apple is (7,6), which is to the right and down. Moving DOWN to (4,8) next turn would start descending toward it while keeping rightward options open. Moving RIGHT to (5,9) would keep me on the top edge longer, which is riskier if the enemy later cuts me off.\n\nMy immediate goal: survive this turn (only RIGHT is safe). Next turn, I plan to go DOWN to (4,8) if it remains safe (enemy won't reach there). That will give me more open space and a path toward (7,6).\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the only safe move. I must take it.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (4,9), next turn I will have two safe moves: DOWN to (4,8) and RIGHT to (5,9). Prefer DOWN to (4,8) to descend toward apple (7,6) and increase mobility, unless enemy movement makes DOWN unsafe (unlikely). Check enemy's possible moves: enemy is at (2,3) and can move DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, but cannot reach (4,8) in one move. So DOWN should be safe. Proceed with that plan.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (5,0), (8,9), (3,0).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (3,3), body length 14, apples 14.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction from (4,9):**\n\n- **UP** to (4,10): Off board (y=10 > 9) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (4,8): Within board. Board shows '.' at (4,8). My body: currently my segment 2 is at (3,9), segment 3 at (2,9), etc. After my move, my body will shift forward, so (4,8) will be free (my tail at (6,7) moves to (6,6)). No enemy body there. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (3,9): Within board. Board shows 'T' (my body\u2019s second segment) at (3,9). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 immediate death. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,9). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (3,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,4): Board shows '.' at (3,4). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- DOWN to (3,2): Board shows '.' at (3,2). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT to (2,3): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Board shows '.' at (4,3). My body: none. Enemy body: none. \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go DOWN to (4,8). Enemy cannot reach (4,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (5,9). Enemy cannot reach (5,9) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate future mobility and apple proximity.**\n\nFrom (4,9):\n- **DOWN to (4,8)**:  \n  Next turn from (4,8), possible moves:  \n  - UP back to (4,9) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (4,7) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - LEFT to (3,8) \u2192 currently 'T' (my body segment 7) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (5,8) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  So two safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). This moves me closer to apple (7,6) (distance now: |7-4|+|6-8|=3+2=5; after move: |7-4|+|6-7|=3+1=4). Opens path downward.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,9)**:  \n  Next turn from (5,9), possible moves:  \n  - UP off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  So two safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). This stays on top edge, distance to (7,6): |7-5|+|6-9|=2+3=5 (same as current). Less progress toward apple.\n\nApple (8,9) is at top-right corner, but moving RIGHT toward it risks getting trapped along top edge with limited escape. Better to descend into more open board.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan.**\n\nI need to catch up in apples (enemy has 14, I have 13). Closest apple is (7,6). Moving DOWN now starts a descent toward it while keeping rightward option open. From (4,8) next turn, I can go DOWN to (4,7) or RIGHT to (5,8), both leading toward (7,6). This also avoids being stuck on top row.\n\nEnemy is far away at (3,3), likely heading toward apples at (3,0) or (5,0). I have time to maneuver.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is safe and improves my position toward the nearest apple while maintaining mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (4,8), next turn I will have safe moves DOWN to (4,7) and RIGHT to (5,8). Prefer DOWN to (4,7) to continue descending toward apple (7,6), unless enemy movement changes safety. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (3,3) it can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT, but cannot reach (4,7) in one move. So DOWN should be safe. Proceed with that plan.\n\nDOWN",

(will be free).  \n  So only one safe move (RIGHT) from (4,7). That\u2019s risky\u2014could lead to a dead end if I get trapped.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**:  \n  Next turn from (5,8), possible moves:  \n  - UP to (5,9) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - DOWN to (5,7) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - LEFT to (4,8) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (6,8) \u2192 currently '.'

Moving RIGHT to (5,8) keeps more options open and still moves me closer to the apple.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan.**\n\nI need to catch up in apples. Enemy is at (3,2) and may head toward apples at (3,0) or (5,0). I should aim for (7,6) or (8,9). (8,9) is farther but reachable via top-right. From (5,8), I can go RIGHT to (6,8), then DOWN to (6,7) etc., approaching (7,6) safely while avoiding trapping myself.\n\nMoving RIGHT now gives better future flexibility and avoids a potential trap at (4,7). Even though DOWN also reduces distance to apple, the mobility hit is too dangerous.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, improves apple distance, and maintains high mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,8), next turn I will have safe moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Likely choose RIGHT to (6,8) to continue toward apple (7,6) unless enemy movement changes safety. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (3,2) it can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, none threaten (6,8) in one move. So plan to move RIGHT next turn if safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (5,0), (8,9), (3,0).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (3,1), body length 14, apples 14.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction from (5,8):**\n\n- **UP** to (5,9): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,9). After my move, my tail moves from (6,6) to (5,6), so (5,9) will be free. No enemy body there. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (5,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,7). After move, my body shifts, so (5,7) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (4,8): Within board. Board shows '0' (my body segment 2) at (4,8) \u2192 **UNSAFE** (would hit my own body).\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): Within board. Board shows '.' at (6,8). After move, my body shifts, so (6,8) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (3,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,2): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (3,0): Within board. Board shows 'A' (apple) at (3,0). No body there. \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT to (2,1): Board shows '.' at (2,1). My body: none. \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,1): Board shows '.' at (4,1). My body: none. \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go UP to (5,9). Enemy cannot reach (5,9) in one move (max move from (3,1) is to (3,0),(2,1),(4,1)) \u2192 safe.\n- I go DOWN to (5,7). Enemy cannot reach (5,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (6,8). Enemy cannot reach (6,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate future mobility and apple proximity.**\n\nFrom (5,8):\n- **UP to (5,9)**:  \n  Next turn from (5,9), possible moves:  \n  - UP to (5,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 currently 'T' (my body segment 3) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  So only one safe move (RIGHT) from (5,9). That\u2019s risky\u2014could lead to a dead end.\n\n- **DOWN to (5,7)**:  \n  Next turn from (5,7), possible moves:  \n  - UP to (5,8) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 currently 'T' (my body segment 12) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT to (4,7) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - RIGHT to (6,7) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  So two safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Better than UP but still limited.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**:  \n  Next turn from (6,8), possible moves:  \n  - UP to (6,9) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - DOWN to (6,7) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  - LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 will be occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT to (7,8) \u2192 currently '.' (will be free).  \n  So three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Much better mobility.\n\nApple (7,6) is closest. Distance from (5,8) to (7,6): |7-5|+|6-8|=2+2=4.  \nFrom (6,8): distance = |7-6|+|6-8|=1+2=3 (closer).  \nFrom (5,7): distance = |7-5|+|6-7|=2+1=3 (same as from (6,8)).  \nFrom (5,9): distance = |7-5|+|6-9|=2+3=5 (farther).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,8) improves distance to (7,6) and maintains high mobility. Moving DOWN to (5,7) also improves distance but gives fewer safe moves next turn. UP is worst for both mobility and apple distance.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan.**\n\nI need to catch up in apples. Enemy is at (3,1) and may go DOWN to (3,0) to eat that apple, increasing its lead. I should aim for (7,6) or (8,9). From (6,8), I can go DOWN to (6,7) next turn, then DOWN again to (6,6) (but note (6,6) is currently my tail\u2014will move away after this turn). Actually, my tail is at (6,6) now, but after this turn my tail moves to (5,6). So (6,6) will be free next turn. That gives a path toward (7,6) via (6,6) \u2192 (7,6). That seems safe and efficient.\n\nMoving RIGHT now sets me up for that path while keeping options open. DOWN to (5,7) also allows moving RIGHT to (6,7) next turn, but then I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s possible area if it moves toward (5,0). RIGHT feels safer and more flexible.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, improves apple distance, and maintains high mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,8), next turn I will have safe moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Likely choose DOWN to (6,7) to continue toward apple (7,6) unless enemy movement changes safety. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (3,1) it can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, none threaten (6,7) in one move. So plan to move DOWN next turn if safe.\n\nRIGHT",

UP is worse.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and enemy threat.**\n\nEnemy is at (3,0) and may move LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0). It could be heading toward apple (5,0) if it goes RIGHT then DOWN. I need to focus on eating apples quickly to catch up. Apple (7,6) is reachable: from (6,7) I can go DOWN to (6,6) then RIGHT to (7,6). From (7,8) I can go DOWN to (7,7) then DOWN to (7,6). Both are two moves away.\n\nBut note: from (6,7), going DOWN to (6,6) next turn\u2014(6,6) will be free (my tail is at (4,6) after this turn). That seems safe. From (7,8), going DOWN to (7,7) then DOWN to (7,6) also safe.\n\nConsider apple (8,9) and (9,3). (8,9) is far but could be a target later. (9,3) is also far.\n\nI should also consider avoiding potential future dead ends. My body occupies much of the top rows. Moving DOWN keeps me in more open area.\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves don\u2019t threaten me directly now, but if it goes RIGHT to (4,0) and then up, it could eventually cut off my access to lower apples. I should secure (7,6) soon.\n\n**Decision:** Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe and equally good for apple distance and mobility. I\u2019ll choose DOWN because it moves me toward the lower half where apples (5,0) and (9,0) are, giving future flexibility, and it avoids moving right into the right edge prematurely.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (6,7), next turn I will likely go DOWN to (6,6) to approach apple (7,6), unless enemy movement changes safety. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (3,0) it can go LEFT/RIGHT, none threaten (6,6) in one move. So plan to move DOWN next turn if safe.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 61:**\n\nMy snake head at (6,7). Body length 13 (head + 12 segments). Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (5,0), (8,9), (9,3).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (4,0), body length 15, apples 15.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction from (6,7):**\n\n- **UP** to (6,8): Within board. Board shows '.' at (6,8). After my move, my tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6), so (6,8) will be free. No enemy body there. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (6,6): Within board. Board shows '.' at (6,6). After move, my body shifts, so (6,6) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (5,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,7). After move, my body shifts, so (5,7) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (7,7). After move, my body shifts, so (7,7) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (4,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,1): Board shows '.' (free).\n- DOWN to (4,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (3,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (5,0): Apple at (5,0). If enemy moves there, it eats apple and grows. That cell is free for movement.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (4,1) and RIGHT to (5,0).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go UP to (6,8). Enemy cannot reach (6,8) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go DOWN to (6,6). Enemy cannot reach (6,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go LEFT to (5,7). Enemy cannot reach (5,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (7,7). Enemy cannot reach (7,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate future mobility and apple proximity.**\n\nApple (7,6) is closest. Distance from (6,7) to (7,6): |7-6|+|6-7|=1+1=2.  \nFrom each candidate:\n- **UP to (6,8)**: distance to (7,6) = |7-6|+|6-8|=1+2=3 (worse).\n- **DOWN to (6,6)**: distance = |7-6|+|6-6|=1+0=1 (best).\n- **LEFT to (5,7)**: distance = |7-5|+|6-7|=2+1=3 (worse).\n- **RIGHT to (7,7)**: distance = |7-7|+|6-7|=0+1=1 (best, tied with DOWN).\n\nCheck mobility from each:\n- **UP (6,8)**: Next turn safe moves? From (6,8): UP to (6,9) free, LEFT to (5,8) free, RIGHT to (7,8) free. DOWN to (6,7) will be my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves.\n- **DOWN (6,6)**: From (6,6): UP to (6,7) will be my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe. DOWN to (6,5) free, LEFT to (5,6) free, RIGHT to (7,6) apple. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Moving RIGHT next turn eats apple (7,6).\n- **LEFT (5,7)**: From (5,7): UP to (5,8) free, DOWN to (5,6) free, LEFT to (4,7) free, RIGHT to (6,7) my body \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves.\n- **RIGHT (7,7)**: From (7,7): UP to (7,8) free, DOWN to (7,6) apple, LEFT to (6,7) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (8,7) free. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Moving DOWN next turn eats apple (7,6).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT put me one move away from eating apple (7,6) next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and enemy threat.**\n\nEnemy may eat apple (5,0) if it moves RIGHT, increasing its lead. I need to eat apples quickly. Apple (7,6) is my nearest target. Moving DOWN to (6,6) sets up a direct RIGHT to (7,6) next turn. Moving RIGHT to (7,7) sets up a direct DOWN to (7,6) next turn. Both are equally good for that apple.\n\nConsider board edges: My body occupies top rows. Moving DOWN keeps me in more open central area. Moving RIGHT moves me closer to right edge (x=9), which could limit future mobility if I get trapped.\n\nAlso, from (6,6) I have access to lower apples (9,0) and (5,0) later. From (7,7) I\u2019m closer to (8,9) and (9,3), but those are farther.\n\nEnemy\u2019s move to (5,0) would put it at (5,0) eating apple, then its body extends. It\u2019s far from me now, so no immediate threat.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN and RIGHT are equally good for immediate apple proximity and mobility. I choose DOWN because it keeps me more central and avoids the right edge, providing better future options to navigate around my own body and pursue multiple apples.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (6,6), next turn I will move RIGHT to (7,6) to eat the apple, provided it remains safe (check enemy movement and my body positions then). If RIGHT becomes unsafe, I can go DOWN to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,6) to maintain mobility.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 62:**\n\nMy snake head at (6,6). Body length 13 (head + 12 segments). Apples collected: 13.  \nApples at: (7,6), (9,0), (8,9), (9,3), (9,1).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (5,0), body length 16 (just ate apple at (5,0)? Wait, board shows apple at (5,0) last turn, enemy head at (5,0) now. If enemy moved RIGHT into (5,0), it ate that apple, so its length increased by 1 to 16, and apple (5,0) is gone. Current apples list shows (9,0), (8,9), (9,3), (9,1) and (7,6) \u2014 yes, (5,0) not listed, so enemy ate it. Enemy apples: 16.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check for each direction from (6,6):**\n\n- **UP** to (6,7): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (6,7)? Wait, board state shows at row 6, column 6 is '0' (my head), column 7 is 'A' (apple). Actually row 6: \"T T T T . . 0 A . .\" So (6,7) is 'A' (apple). That's an apple, not a body. After my move, my body shifts: my tail (3,6) moves? Let's trace: My body is [(6,7), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6)]. After moving, head goes to new cell, each segment shifts forward, tail (3,6) is removed unless I eat an apple. So (6,7) will be occupied by my body's second segment (old head (6,6) becomes segment 2). So moving UP to (6,7) would move into my own body's next segment? Wait: If I move UP, my new head is (6,7). At that moment, my old head (6,6) becomes segment 2, and the old segment 1 (6,7) becomes segment 2? Actually the body list shifts: new head at (6,7), then old head (6,6) becomes segment 2, old segment 1 (6,7) becomes segment 3, etc. So (6,7) is currently occupied by my body segment 1. Moving into it would be moving into my own body \u2192 **UNSAFE** (death). So UP is **NOT SAFE**.\n\n- **DOWN** to (6,5): Within board. Board shows '.' at (6,5) (row 5 column 6 is '.'). After move, my body shifts, (6,5) will be free. No enemy body there. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\n- **LEFT** to (5,6): Within board. Board shows '.' at (5,6) (row 6 column 5 is '.'). After move, my body shifts, (5,6) free. No enemy body. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (7,6): Within board. Board shows 'A' at (7,6) (apple). After move, if I go there, I eat apple and grow. That cell is free of bodies. \u2192 **SAFE** (eating apple is safe).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (5,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,1): Board shows '.' (free).\n- DOWN to (5,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (4,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (6,0): Board shows '.' (free).\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (5,1) and RIGHT to (6,0).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go DOWN to (6,5). Enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go LEFT to (5,6). Enemy cannot reach (5,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (7,6). Enemy cannot reach (7,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApple (7,6) is right next to me. Moving RIGHT eats it immediately, gaining an apple and growing to length 14. That\u2019s highly desirable to catch up to enemy (they have 16).  \nApple (9,0) is far. Apple (8,9) is far. Apple (9,3) and (9,1) are also far.\n\nFrom each candidate after move:\n- **RIGHT to (7,6)**: Eat apple. New head at (7,6). Next turn safe moves? From (7,6): UP to (7,7) free, DOWN to (7,5) free, LEFT to (6,6) will be my body segment 2 (old head) \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (8,6) free. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n- **DOWN to (6,5)**: No apple. From (6,5): UP to (6,6) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (6,4) free, LEFT to (5,5) free, RIGHT to (7,5) free. So 3 safe moves. But apple (7,6) is still nearby (distance 2).\n- **LEFT to (5,6)**: No apple. From (5,6): UP to (5,7) free, DOWN to (5,5) free, LEFT to (4,6) free, RIGHT to (6,6) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves. Apple (7,6) distance 2.\n\nClearly RIGHT is best for immediate apple consumption.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term considerations.**\n\nEating apple (7,6) brings me to 14 apples vs enemy 16, narrowing gap. It also grows my length, which can help block enemy later. My body currently loops around top; after eating, my tail stays at (3,6) (since growth adds segment at tail, so tail remains at (3,6) one more turn). That means my body will occupy (7,6) as head, (6,6) as segment 2, etc. This may affect future mobility but is fine.\n\nEnemy is far away at bottom left; no immediate threat. It might move towards apples (9,0) or (9,1). I should plan to target other apples after (7,6). Next closest apple is (9,3) or (9,1). From (7,6), I can head rightwards toward column 9.\n\nPotential trap: My own body occupies many cells in rows 8-9. Moving too far up/right could get me trapped. But after eating (7,6), I can go DOWN to (7,5) to stay central, then LEFT/DOWN to approach (9,0) area.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to eat apple (7,6) is the optimal move. It\u2019s safe, gains an apple, and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,6) and eating apple, next turn I will assess safety from (7,6). Likely move DOWN to (7,5) to open space and move toward lower apples (9,0) or (9,1), unless enemy poses a threat. Avoid moving UP into my dense body area unless necessary.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy likely moved RIGHT from (5,0) to (6,0) last turn (since board shows '1' at (6,0) now). That move did not eat an apple.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,6):**\n\n- **UP** to (7,7): Within board. Board shows '.' at (7,7) (row 7 column 7 is '.'). After move, my body shifts: old head (7,6) becomes segment 2, old segment 1 (6,6) becomes segment 3, etc. (7,7) will be free. No enemy body there. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,5): Within board. Board shows '.' at (7,5). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,6): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (6,6) (my own body segment 2 after shift). Moving into it would be moving into my own body \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,6): Within board. Board shows '.' at (8,6). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (6,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (6,1): Board shows '.' (free).\n- DOWN to (6,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (7,0): Board shows '.'

Enemy cannot reach (7,7) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go DOWN to (7,5). Enemy cannot reach (7,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (8,6). Enemy cannot reach (8,6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (9,0) far bottom-right, (8,9) far top-right, (9,3) far right, (9,1) far right, (5,1) left-center near enemy.\n\nFrom (7,6):\n- **UP to (7,7)**: No apple. From (7,7) next turn: UP to (7,8) free, DOWN to (7,6) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (6,7) free, RIGHT to (8,7) free \u2192 3 safe moves. Moves me toward top-right apples (8,9) but my body occupies rows 8-9 in columns 8-9, so careful.\n- **DOWN to (7,5)**: No apple. From (7,5): UP to (7,6) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,4) free, LEFT to (6,5) free, RIGHT to (8,5) free \u2192 3 safe moves.

Moves me toward right side, closer to apples (9,3),(9,1).\n\nApple (5,1) is near enemy head (6,0) \u2014 enemy likely moves UP to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,0); if enemy goes UP to (6,1), it\u2019s one step from (5,1). I cannot reach (5,1) quickly. Better to target apples on right side.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan.**\n\nI need to catch up to enemy (14 vs 16 apples). I should aim for the cluster of apples on right: (9,3), (9,1), (9,0), (8,9). From my position, moving DOWN to (7,5) then RIGHT/DOWN toward (9,0) seems efficient. Moving UP risks getting trapped in my own body loops at top-right. Moving RIGHT to (8,6) also okay but may box me in if I go too far right without escape.\n\nCheck board: My body occupies many cells in rows 8-9 columns 8-9 (tail area). I should avoid moving into that region prematurely. From (7,5), I can go RIGHT to (8,5), then DOWN to (9,5), then LEFT to (9,4),(9,3) to eat apple (9,3), then (9,2),(9,1) etc. That path seems open.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (7,5) is best. It keeps me central, avoids my dense body area, and sets up a path toward the right-side apples while maintaining good mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (7,5), next turn I will likely go RIGHT to (8,5) to continue toward right-side apples, unless enemy poses a threat. Monitor enemy movement toward apple (5,1).\n\nDOWN",

Enemy likely moved RIGHT from (6,0) to (7,0) last turn (board shows '1' at (7,0) now). That move did not eat an apple.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,5):**\n\n- **UP** to (7,6): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (7,6) (my own body segment 2 after shift). Moving into my own body \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,4): Within board. Board shows '.' at (7,4). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,5): Within board.

After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (7,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (7,1): Board shows '.' (free).\n- DOWN to (7,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (6,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (8,0): Board shows '.' (free).\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (7,1) and RIGHT to (8,0).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go DOWN to (7,4). Enemy cannot reach (7,4) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go LEFT to (6,5). Enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (8,5). Enemy cannot reach (8,5) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (9,0), (8,9), (9,3), (9,1), (5,1).\n\nFrom (7,5):\n- **DOWN to (7,4)**: No apple. From (7,4) next turn: UP to (7,5) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,3) free, LEFT to (6,4) free, RIGHT to (8,4) free \u2192 3 safe moves. Moves me toward bottom-right apples (9,0),(9,1) but still distant.\n- **LEFT to (6,5)**: No apple. From (6,5): UP to (6,6) my body segment 3 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (6,4) free, LEFT to (5,5) free, RIGHT to (7,5) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe \u2192 only 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT). This reduces mobility and moves me away from most apples.\n- **RIGHT to (8,5)**: No apple. From (8,5): UP to (8,6) free, DOWN to (8,4) free, LEFT to (7,5) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (9,5) free \u2192 3 safe moves. Moves me toward right side, closer to apples (9,3),(9,1),(9,0) and (8,9) via upward path later.\n\nApple (5,1) is near enemy; enemy may move UP to (7,1) or RIGHT to (8,0). If enemy goes UP to (7,1), it's two steps from (5,1). I am far from (5,1). Best to target right-side apples.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and board awareness.**\n\nMy body occupies a long trail in top-right and left areas. Moving LEFT into (6,5) leads to a region with fewer escape routes and away from apples. Moving DOWN to (7,4) is okay but delays reaching apples. Moving RIGHT to (8,5) is aggressive toward the apple cluster and maintains good mobility.\n\nCheck potential traps: From (8,5), I can go RIGHT to (9,5) next, then DOWN to (9,4), LEFT to (9,3) to eat apple (9,3). That path seems clear. The board shows '.' at (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) is apple. My body does not block that immediate path.\n\nEnemy is on bottom row; unlikely to interfere quickly. I need to catch up in apples (14 vs 16). Targeting the right-side cluster is efficient.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (8,5) is best. It maximizes future options and moves directly toward multiple apples.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,5), next turn I will likely go RIGHT to (9,5) to approach apple (9,3), unless enemy poses an unexpected threat. Monitor enemy movement toward apple (5,1) but stay focused on right-side apples.\n\nRIGHT",

The fastest way to it is RIGHT then DOWN next turn. However, moving RIGHT now reduces my next-turn options to 2. Moving DOWN to (8,4) gives me 3 options next turn and I can still go RIGHT to (9,4) then DOWN to (9,3) to eat it in two turns (same as RIGHT then DOWN). So DOWN is safer mobility-wise.\n\nCheck potential traps: From (8,4), I can go RIGHT to (9,4) next, then DOWN to (9,3) to eat apple. That path is clear (board shows '.' at (9,4) and (9,3) is apple). Enemy is unlikely to reach (9,3) before me.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,4) is best. It maintains good mobility and still targets apple (9,3) efficiently.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,4), next turn I will likely go RIGHT to (9,4) to set up eating apple (9,3) the following turn, unless enemy poses an unexpected threat.

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 66:**\n\nMy snake head now at (8,4) after moving DOWN last turn. Body length 14. Apples collected: 14.  \nApples at: (8,9), (9,3), (9,1), (5,1), (1,1).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (9,0), body length 17 (apples: 17). Enemy moved RIGHT from (8,0) to (9,0) last turn and ate the apple at (9,0) (now gone). Enemy now has 17 apples.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (8,4):**\n\n- **UP** to (8,5): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (8,5) (my own body segment 1 after shift). Moving into my own body \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (8,3): Within board. Board shows '.' at (8,3). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (7,4): Within board. Board shows '.' at (7,4). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,4): Within board. Board shows '.' at (9,4). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (9,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (9,1): Board shows 'A' (apple at (9,1)).\n- DOWN to (9,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (8,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (10,0) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (9,1) (eating apple). That will increase its apples to 18.\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go DOWN to (8,3). Enemy cannot reach (8,3) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go LEFT to (7,4). Enemy cannot reach (7,4) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (9,4). Enemy cannot reach (9,4) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (9,1), (5,1), (1,1).\n\nFrom (8,4):\n- **DOWN to (8,3)**: No apple. From (8,3) next turn: UP to (8,4) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (8,2) free, LEFT to (7,3) free, RIGHT to (9,3) apple \u2192 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Moves me toward apple (9,3) via RIGHT next turn.\n- **LEFT to (7,4)**: No apple. From (7,4) next turn: UP to (7,5) my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,3) free, LEFT to (6,4) free, RIGHT to (8,4) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT). Moves me away from most apples.\n- **RIGHT to (9,4)**: No apple. From (9,4) next turn: UP to (9,5) free, DOWN to (9,3) apple, LEFT to (8,4) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Puts me adjacent to apple (9,3) via DOWN next turn.\n\nApple (9,1) will likely be eaten by enemy this turn. Apple (9,3) is the closest valuable target. Apple (8,9) is far but reachable later. Apple (5,1) and (1,1) are far and near enemy territory.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and board awareness.**\n\nMy body occupies a long trail in top-right and left areas. Moving RIGHT to (9,4) gets me to the right edge, which reduces future moves (only UP/DOWN next turn) but puts me directly above apple (9,3). I can eat it next turn by moving DOWN. Moving DOWN to (8,3) also allows me to eat (9,3) next turn by moving RIGHT, but from (8,3) I have 3 safe moves next turn, giving more flexibility if something changes. Moving LEFT to (7,4) reduces options and moves away from apples.\n\nEnemy will eat (9,1) and lead 18 to 14. I need to secure (9,3) quickly to catch up. Both DOWN and RIGHT allow eating (9,3) in two turns (RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT). However, DOWN to (8,3) gives me more escape routes next turn if enemy somehow threatens (9,3) \u2014 but enemy is at (9,1) moving to (9,1) this turn, then next turn it could move UP to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,1), etc. It\u2019s unlikely to reach (9,3) before me if I commit.\n\nCheck potential traps: From (9,4) after RIGHT, next turn only UP/DOWN are safe. If I go DOWN to (9,3) and eat apple, I grow and my tail extends, but I\u2019ll be at (9,3) with only UP/LEFT/RIGHT possible (DOWN off board). That\u2019s okay. From (8,3) after DOWN, next turn I can go RIGHT to (9,3) to eat, then from (9,3) I\u2019ll have UP/LEFT/RIGHT (DOWN off board) \u2014 same outcome.\n\nGiven that DOWN offers more next-turn options (3 vs 2) and still reaches the apple in the same number of turns, DOWN is slightly safer for mobility.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,3) is best. It maintains good mobility and targets apple (9,3) efficiently.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,3), next turn I will go RIGHT to (9,3) to eat the apple, unless enemy moves to (9,2) and threatens a head-on collision (unlikely). Monitor enemy movement after it eats (9,1).\n\nDOWN",

Enemy now has 18 apples.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (8,3):**\n\n- **UP** to (8,4): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (8,4) (my own body segment 1 after shift).

Board shows '.' at (7,3). After move, free. \u2192 **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,3): Within board. Board shows 'A' (apple) at (9,3). After move, free (apple cell). \u2192 **SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (9,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (9,2): Board shows '.'.\n- DOWN to (9,0): Occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (8,1): Board shows '.'.\n- RIGHT to (10,1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are UP to (9,2) and LEFT to (8,1).\n\nNow check head-on collision risk for my safe moves:\n- I go DOWN to (8,2). Enemy cannot reach (8,2) in one move (only (9,2) or (8,1)) \u2192 safe.\n- I go LEFT to (7,3). Enemy cannot reach (7,3) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- I go RIGHT to (9,3). Enemy cannot reach (9,3) in one move (only (9,2) or (8,1)) \u2192 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).\n\nFrom (8,3):\n- **RIGHT to (9,3)**: Eat apple \u2192 grow to length 15, apples 15. From (9,3) after eating: UP to (9,4) free, DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (8,3) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe \u2192 only 1 safe move (UP). This puts me in a corner with limited options next turn.\n- **DOWN to (8,2)**: No apple. From (8,2) next turn: UP to (8,3) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (8,1) free, LEFT to (7,2) free, RIGHT to (9,2) free \u2192 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Keeps mobility high.\n- **LEFT to (7,3)**: No apple. From (7,3) next turn: UP to (7,4) free, DOWN to (7,2) free, LEFT to (6,3) free, RIGHT to (8,3) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Moves away from apples.\n\nApple (9,3) is adjacent. Eating it now would catch me up to 15 apples vs enemy 18, but traps me at the right edge with only UP safe next turn\u2014high risk of being trapped or killed if enemy approaches. Better to delay eating until I have a safer exit.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and board awareness.**\n\nMy body occupies a long trail. Enemy is at (9,1) and may move UP to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,1). If enemy moves UP to (9,2), it will be adjacent to (9,3) and could eat it next turn. If I move RIGHT now, I eat it but get stuck. If I move DOWN to (8,2), I stay safe and can potentially intercept: if enemy moves UP to (9,2), then next turn enemy might eat (9,3) if I don\u2019t, but I could move RIGHT to (9,2) for a head-on collision? That\u2019s risky. Better to let enemy eat (9,3) if it wants, while I stay mobile and target other apples.\n\nApple (2,8) is near my body trail but reachable. Apple (8,9) is far. Apple (5,1) and (1,1) are near enemy territory. I need to survive and keep options open.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,2) gives best mobility (3 safe moves next turn) and avoids trapping myself. It also positions me to potentially move RIGHT to (9,2) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take it, or go down toward lower apples.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,2) is safest and maintains flexibility. I will not greedily eat (9,3) now because it leads to a dead-end next turn.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,2), assess enemy position. If enemy moves to (9,2), avoid head-on collision and consider moving LEFT/DOWN to target apple (5,1) or (1,1). If enemy moves to (8,1), I can consider RIGHT to (9,2) to approach apple (9,3) with more escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

Apples collected: 14.  \nApples at: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (8,1), body length 18 (apples: 18). Enemy moved LEFT to (8,1) last turn (as predicted possible). Enemy now has 18 apples.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (8,2):**\n\n- **UP** to (8,3): Within board. Board shows 'T' at (8,3) (my own body segment 1 after shift). Moving into my own body \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (8,1): Within board. Board shows enemy snake #1's head at (8,1) currently. If I move DOWN, my head moves into a cell occupied by enemy head this turn? Wait: both snakes move simultaneously. If I move DOWN to (8,1) and enemy also moves somewhere else, then (8,1) might become free. But enemy head is currently at (8,1). If enemy moves away (e.g., UP to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,1)), then (8,1) becomes free. However, if enemy stays (e.g., moves UP to (8,2) which is my current head position), then we could have head-on collision. Need to evaluate enemy's possible moves from (8,1) to assess risk.\n\nLet's first list all my possible moves and check static board occupancy (ignoring simultaneous movement for now):\n- UP: (8,3) my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,1) currently enemy head \u2192 potentially unsafe depending on enemy move.\n- LEFT: (7,2) board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,2) board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n\nSo static safe: LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is conditionally safe depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (8,1) and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (8,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (8,2): Currently my head (8,2). If enemy moves UP and I stay, head-on collision \u2192 both die.\n- DOWN to (8,0): Board shows 'T' (enemy body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (7,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are LEFT to (7,1) and RIGHT to (9,1). UP to (8,2) is unsafe because it's my head? Wait, rule: moving into another snake's body kills you. But my head is not my body; it's my head. The rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" It does not say moving into another snake's head kills you (that's head-on collision if both move into same cell). So enemy moving UP to (8,2) would be moving into a cell occupied by my head. That is not automatically unsafe for enemy unless I also move into that cell. Actually, if enemy moves into my head's current cell and I move away, enemy would be moving into a cell that becomes free (since I left). But my head is not a body segment; it's a head. The board representation shows '0' for my head, but that's just a marker. The rule for collision: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" My head is not my body; my body starts from the segment behind head. So enemy moving into my head's current cell is not moving into my body; it's moving into a cell that contains my head. That could lead to head-on collision if I also move into that cell, but if I move away, enemy just moves into an empty cell. However, there's also rule: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\" So if enemy moves to (8,2) and I move to (8,2) from (8,2)? That's impossible. If enemy moves to (8,2) and I move elsewhere, no head-on collision. But is it allowed for enemy to move into a cell currently occupied by my head? Yes, because heads are not bodies. So enemy could consider (8,2) as a possible move if it's not occupied by a body. The board shows '0' at (8,2) but that's my head; after I move, that cell becomes my body segment? Actually, when I move, my head leaves (8,2) and my body shifts; the old head position becomes the new first body segment. So at the moment of movement, the cell (8,2) will become my body segment after I move. If enemy moves into (8,2) simultaneously, enemy would be moving into a cell that becomes my body segment at the end of the turn. That would kill enemy because \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\" So enemy moving to (8,2) is unsafe for enemy because it would die (since my old head position becomes my body). Therefore, enemy will not choose UP to (8,2) because it's suicidal. So enemy's truly safe moves are LEFT to (7,1) and RIGHT to (9,1).\n\nThus enemy will likely move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate my DOWN move to (8,1):\n- If I move DOWN to (8,1) and enemy moves LEFT to (7,1) or RIGHT to (9,1), then (8,1) becomes free and I move into it safely. No head-on collision because enemy left.\n- If enemy stays (impossible because enemy must move; all snakes move each turn). So enemy will move to (7,1) or (9,1). Therefore, my DOWN move is safe because enemy will vacate (8,1).\n\nThus all three moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).\n\nFrom (8,2):\n- **DOWN to (8,1)**: No apple. From (8,1) next turn: UP to (8,2) my body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (8,0) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (7,1) possibly free (enemy might be there now), RIGHT to (9,1) possibly free. Need to check: after this turn, enemy will be at (7,1) or (9,1). If enemy goes LEFT to (7,1), then (7,1) occupied; if enemy goes RIGHT to (9,1), then (9,1) occupied. So from (8,1) next turn, safe moves might be only the direction enemy didn't go. That's risky: could leave me with only 1 safe move.\n- **LEFT to (7,2)**: No apple. From (7,2) next turn: UP to (7,3) free, DOWN to (7,1) possibly enemy occupied, LEFT to (6,2) free, RIGHT to (8,2) my body \u2192 unsafe. So likely 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy not at (7,1). If enemy at (7,1), then DOWN unsafe \u2192 still 2 safe moves.\n- **RIGHT to (9,2)**: No apple. From (9,2) next turn: UP to (9,3) apple (but could be eaten by enemy this turn?), DOWN to (9,1) possibly enemy occupied, LEFT to (8,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe. So safe moves only UP if (9,1) occupied by enemy? Actually, if enemy at (9,1), DOWN unsafe; so only UP safe. That's a trap.\n\nApple (9,3) is at (9,3). If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,1), it's two steps away from apple. If I move RIGHT to (9,2), I'm adjacent to apple but next turn only UP safe, and enemy could move to (9,2) next turn? Not if I'm there. Hmm.\n\nBetter to consider: enemy is at (8,1) and will move LEFT or RIGHT. If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,1), then apple (9,3) is two steps up. Enemy could go UP next turn to (9,2) then (9,3). If I move RIGHT to (9,2), I block enemy's path but trap myself. If I move LEFT to (7,2), I stay central.\n\nApple (5,1) and (1,1) are lower left. My body blocks some areas. Apple (2,8) is near my tail.\n\nLong-term: I'm behind in apples (14 vs 18). Need to catch up but stay alive. Moving DOWN to (8,1) seems to risk being next to enemy with limited exits. Moving LEFT to (7,2) keeps mobility and moves toward center/left apples. Moving RIGHT to (9,2) is risky trap.\n\n**Step 4: Avoid future dead-ends.**\n\nCheck board: my body forms a long line along top and right. Enemy body is long along bottom and left. The center is relatively open.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7,2) gives options to go toward (5,1) or (1,1) later. It also avoids immediate confrontation.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (7,2) is safest and maintains good mobility. It avoids trapping myself and keeps distance from enemy.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (7,2), assess enemy position. If enemy moved to (7,1), be cautious of moving DOWN. Consider moving UP to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,2) to approach apple (5,1). If enemy moved to (9,1), then apple (9,3) is still available but risky; maybe ignore and focus on left apples.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 14.  \nApples at: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (7,1) (it moved LEFT as predicted). Enemy body length 18 (apples: 18).\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,2):**\n\n- **UP** to (7,3): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN** to (7,1): Board shows enemy head '1' at (7,1). This is currently enemy head. Need to consider simultaneous movement.\n- **LEFT** to (6,2): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,2): Board shows 'T' (my own body segment 1 after shift) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nStatic safe: UP, LEFT. DOWN is conditionally safe depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (7,1) and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (7,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (7,2): My current head position. If enemy moves UP and I stay, head-on collision? Actually, if enemy moves into my current head cell and I move away, enemy moves into a cell that becomes my body segment after I leave \u2192 enemy would die (moving into my body). So enemy will likely avoid (7,2) because it's suicidal.\n- DOWN to (7,0): Board shows 'T' (enemy body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (6,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (8,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are LEFT to (6,1) and RIGHT to (8,1). Enemy will not choose UP to (7,2) because it would die.\n\nNow evaluate my DOWN move to (7,1):\n- If I move DOWN to (7,1) and enemy moves LEFT to (6,1) or RIGHT to (8,1), then (7,1) becomes free and I move into it safely. No head-on collision because enemy left.\n- Enemy must move, so DOWN is safe.\n\nThus all three moves UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).\n\nFrom (7,2):\n- **UP to (7,3)**: No apple. From (7,3) next turn: UP to (7,4) free, DOWN to (7,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (6,3) free, RIGHT to (8,3) my body \u2192 unsafe. So 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Good mobility.\n- **DOWN to (7,1)**: No apple. From (7,1) next turn: UP to (7,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,0) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (6,1) possibly enemy occupied, RIGHT to (8,1) possibly enemy occupied. If enemy moves to (6,1) or (8,1), then one of those becomes unsafe. Could leave me with only 1 safe move (the direction enemy didn't go). Risky.\n- **LEFT to (6,2)**: No apple. From (6,2) next turn: UP to (6,3) free, DOWN to (6,1) possibly enemy occupied, LEFT to (5,2) free, RIGHT to (7,2) my body \u2192 unsafe. So likely 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy not at (6,1). If enemy at (6,1), DOWN unsafe \u2192 still 2 safe moves.\n\nApple (5,1) is two steps away: from (6,2) I could go DOWN to (6,1) then LEFT to (5,1), but enemy might be at (6,1) this turn. Apple (1,1) is farther left. Apple (2,8) is near my tail but blocked by my body. Apple (9,3) is far right and enemy is closer. Apple (8,9) is far top-right.\n\nGiven I'm behind (14 vs 18), I need to target apples safely. Moving LEFT to (6,2) positions me toward (5,1) and (1,1) while keeping mobility. Moving UP to (7,3) moves me away from those apples but keeps options open. Moving DOWN is risky.\n\n**Step 4: Avoid future dead-ends and consider enemy.**\n\nEnemy at (7,1) will move to (6,1) or (8,1). If enemy moves LEFT to (6,1), then from (6,2) my DOWN would be unsafe next turn, but I still have UP and LEFT. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,1), then (6,1) is free, giving me DOWN option next turn.\n\nLEFT seems a solid choice: it moves toward the cluster of apples on the left (5,1) and (1,1), avoids immediate confrontation, and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (6,2), assess enemy position. If enemy moved to (6,1), avoid DOWN; consider UP to (6,3) or LEFT to (5,2) to approach apple (5,1) from above. If enemy moved to (8,1), then DOWN to (6,1) may be safe next turn, allowing a direct move to (5,1). Continue targeting left-side apples while monitoring enemy's path to (9,3).\n\nLEFT",

Enemy body length 18.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (6,2):**\n\n- **UP** to (6,3): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN** to (6,1): Board shows enemy head '1' at (6,1). This is enemy's current head. Need to consider simultaneous movement.\n- **LEFT** to (5,2): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,2): Board shows 'T' (my own body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nStatic safe: UP, LEFT. DOWN is conditionally safe depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (6,1) and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (6,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (6,2): My current head position. If enemy moves UP and I stay, head-on collision? Actually, if enemy moves into my current head cell and I move away, enemy moves into a cell that becomes my body segment after I leave \u2192 enemy would die (moving into my body). So enemy will likely avoid (6,2) because it's suicidal.\n- DOWN to (6,0): Board shows 'T' (enemy body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5,1): Board shows '.' and there's an apple at (5,1). This is a safe move and gets an apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are LEFT to (5,1) and RIGHT to (7,1). Enemy will not choose UP to (6,2) because it would die.\n\nNow evaluate my DOWN move to (6,1):\n- If I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), then (6,1) becomes free and I move into it safely. No head-on collision because enemy left.\n- Enemy must move, so DOWN is safe.\n\nThus all three moves UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (5,1), (1,1), (2,8).\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- **UP to (6,3)**: No apple. From (6,3) next turn: UP to (6,4) free, DOWN to (6,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (5,3) free, RIGHT to (7,3) my body \u2192 unsafe. So 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Good mobility.\n- **DOWN to (6,1)**: No apple. From (6,1) next turn: UP to (6,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (6,0) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (5,1) possibly enemy occupied (if enemy moved LEFT), RIGHT to (7,1) possibly enemy occupied. If enemy moved LEFT to (5,1), then LEFT unsafe; if enemy moved RIGHT to (7,1), then RIGHT unsafe. Could leave me with only 1 safe move (the direction enemy didn't go). Risky.\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: No apple. From (5,2) next turn: UP to (5,3) free, DOWN to (5,1) possibly enemy occupied (if enemy moved LEFT), LEFT to (4,2) free, RIGHT to (6,2) my body \u2192 unsafe. So likely 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy not at (5,1). If enemy at (5,1), DOWN unsafe \u2192 still 2 safe moves.\n\nApple (5,1) is one step away from (5,2) via DOWN. However, enemy is likely to move to (5,1) this turn because it's a safe apple grab. If enemy takes (5,1), then moving LEFT to (5,2) sets me up to possibly get (1,1) later. Apple (1,1) is farther left. Apple (2,8) is near my tail but blocked by my body. Apple (9,3) is far right and enemy is closer. Apple (8,9) is far top-right.\n\nGiven I'm behind (14 vs 18), I need to target apples safely. Moving LEFT to (5,2) positions me toward the left-side apples (1,1) and possibly (2,8) later, while keeping mobility. Moving UP to (6,3) moves me away from those apples but keeps options open. Moving DOWN is risky and likely fruitless if enemy takes (5,1).\n\n**Step 4: Avoid future dead-ends and consider enemy.**\n\nEnemy at (6,1) will likely move LEFT to (5,1) to eat the apple, growing to length 19. If enemy moves RIGHT to (7,1), then (5,1) remains, but enemy would miss an easy apple\u2014less likely. So assume enemy moves LEFT to (5,1).\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5,1), then from (5,2) my DOWN would be unsafe next turn, but I still have UP and LEFT. That's fine. I can then move UP to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,2) to continue toward (1,1) or (2,8).\n\nLEFT seems a solid choice: it moves toward the left-side apples, avoids immediate confrontation, and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (5,2), assess enemy position. If enemy moved to (5,1), avoid DOWN; consider UP to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,2) to approach apple (1,1) from above. If enemy moved to (7,1), then DOWN to (5,1) may be safe next turn, allowing a direct apple grab. Continue targeting left-side apples while monitoring enemy's path to (9,3).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Analysis for Turn 72:**\n\nMy snake head at (4,2). Body length 14. Apples collected: 14.  \nApples at: (8,9), (9,3), (1,1), (2,8), (4,6).  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (4,1) (it moved LEFT as predicted). Enemy body length now 19.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (4,2):**\n\n- **UP** to (4,3): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN** to (4,1): Board shows enemy head '1' at (4,1). This is enemy's current head. Need to consider simultaneous movement.\n- **LEFT** to (3,2): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,2): Board shows 'T' (my own body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nStatic safe: UP, LEFT. DOWN is conditionally safe depending on enemy move.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (4,1) and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (4,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,2): My current head position. If enemy moves UP and I stay, head-on collision? Actually, if enemy moves into my current head cell and I move away, enemy moves into a cell that becomes my body segment after I leave \u2192 enemy would die (moving into my body). So enemy will likely avoid (4,2) because it's suicidal.\n- DOWN to (4,0): Board shows 'T' (enemy body segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (3,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,1): Board shows '.' \u2192 safe.\n\nThus enemy\u2019s safe moves are LEFT to (3,1) and RIGHT to (5,1). Enemy will not choose UP to (4,2) because it would die.\n\nNow evaluate my DOWN move to (4,1):\n- If I move DOWN to (4,1) and enemy moves LEFT to (3,1) or RIGHT to (5,1), then (4,1) becomes free and I move into it safely. No head-on collision because enemy left.\n- Enemy must move, so DOWN is safe.\n\nThus all three moves UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility.**\n\nApples: (8,9), (9,3), (1,1), (2,8), (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,2):\n- **UP to (4,3)**: No apple. From (4,3) next turn: UP to (4,4) free, DOWN to (4,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (3,3) free, RIGHT to (5,3) my body \u2192 unsafe. So 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Good mobility. This moves me toward apple (4,6) (3 steps: UP, UP, UP) and (2,8) (5 steps: UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP).\n- **DOWN to (4,1)**: No apple (already eaten). From (4,1) next turn: UP to (4,2) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (4,0) enemy body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (3,1) possibly enemy occupied (if enemy moved LEFT), RIGHT to (5,1) possibly enemy occupied. If enemy moved LEFT to (3,1), then LEFT unsafe; if enemy moved RIGHT to (5,1), then RIGHT unsafe. Could leave me with only 1 safe move (the direction enemy didn't go). Risky and doesn't advance toward any apple.\n- **LEFT to (3,2)**: No apple. From (3,2) next turn: UP to (3,3) free, DOWN to (3,1) possibly enemy occupied (if enemy moved LEFT), LEFT to (2,2) free, RIGHT to (4,2) my body \u2192 unsafe. So likely 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy not at (3,1). If enemy at (3,1), DOWN unsafe \u2192 still 2 safe moves. This moves me toward apple (1,1) (2 steps: LEFT, DOWN) and (2,8) (6 steps: UP, UP, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP).\n\nApple (1,1) is closest at Manhattan distance 3 (|4-1|+|2-1|=4? Actually |3|+|1|=4). Wait, from (4,2) to (1,1) is |3|+|1|=4. From (3,2) to (1,1) is |2|+|1|=3. So moving LEFT reduces distance to (1,1). Apple (4,6) is distance 4 from (4,2) (|0|+|4|=4). Moving UP to (4,3) reduces distance to (4,6) to 3.\n\nGiven I'm behind (14 vs 19), I need to target apples aggressively but safely. Both UP and LEFT are safe and maintain mobility. DOWN is risky and doesn't help.\n\n**Step 4: Avoid future dead-ends and consider enemy.**\n\nEnemy at (4,1) will likely move LEFT to (3,1) or RIGHT to (5,1). If enemy moves LEFT to (3,1), then from (3,2) my DOWN would be unsafe next turn, but I still have UP and LEFT. That's fine. I can then move LEFT to (2,2) and then DOWN to (2,1) to approach (1,1). If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,1), then from (3,2) DOWN is safe and I could go DOWN to (3,1) next turn.\n\nLEFT seems slightly better because it directly reduces distance to (1,1) and keeps me away from enemy's likely path (enemy may move toward right-side apples (9,3) or (8,9)). However, UP also good because apple (4,6) is closer and enemy is currently low.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (3,2), assess enemy position. If enemy moved to (3,1), avoid DOWN; consider UP to (3,3) or LEFT to (2,2) to approach apple (1,1) from above. If enemy moved to (5,1), then DOWN to (3,1) may be safe next turn. Continue targeting left-side apples while monitoring enemy's path.\n\nGiven the board, my body occupies much of the right side, so left side has more open space. I'll go LEFT to pursue (1,1) and maintain flexibility.\n\nLEFT",
