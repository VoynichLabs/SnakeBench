It has also collected 1 apple.\n- Apples are at: (0, 8), (0, 6), (3, 0), (7, 2), (3, 3)\n- My last move was LEFT, which was random due to a rate limit error.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\nLet's evaluate each possible move from my current head position (2, 6):\n\n1. **UP (2, 7):**\n   - Target cell: (2, 7)\n   - Cell is empty (not out of bounds, not occupied by any snake)\n   - Safe\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 5):**\n   - Target cell: (2, 5)\n   - Cell is empty\n   - Safe\n\n3. **LEFT (1, 6):**\n   - Target cell: (1, 6)\n   - Cell is empty\n   - Safe\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 6):**\n   - Target cell: (3, 6)\n   - This is my own body segment.\n   - **NOT SAFE - This kills me. Eliminate this option.**\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all safe from immediate death.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction:**\nThe enemy snake's head is at (7, 1). Its body is at (8, 1).\n- It cannot move RIGHT (that's into its own body).\n- It has three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's consider its likely goals:\n- The closest apple is at (7, 2), which is 1 move UP.\n- Moving UP to (7, 2) is a very logical choice for it.\n\nLet's assume it will move UP to (7, 2).\n\n**Strategic Evaluation of My Moves:**\n\n1. **UP (to 2, 7):**\n   - Moves me away from the enemy and towards the apple at (0, 8).\n   - Puts me in open space.\n   - Keeps many future options open.\n   - If the enemy moves UP to (7, 2), there's no collision risk.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 2, 5):**\n   - Moves me further away from all apples.\n   - Leads me towards the bottom of the board, which is less desirable.\n   - Still safe, but strategically poor.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 1, 6):**\n   - Moves me away from apples.\n   - Keeps me closer to the center, which is okay, but I'm moving away from the nearest apple.\n   - Also safe, but not as good as UP.\n\nComparing the safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT), UP is clearly the best:\n- It moves me towards the nearest apple at (0, 8).\n- It positions me in more open space.\n- It moves me away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nMy goal is to get to the apple at (0, 8). From (2, 7), I can continue moving UP or LEFT to approach it. I must remain cautious of the enemy snake's movements and avoid getting boxed in. Prioritize moves that increase my maneuverability and proximity to apples while maintaining maximum distance from the enemy.\n\nUP",

UP\n- New head position: (3, 8).\n- Cell (3, 8) contains an apple.\n- No collision with any snake body or head.\n- This move collects an apple and grows my snake.\n\n#### 2. DOWN\n- New head position: (3, 6).\n- Cell (3, 6) is part of my own body.\n- **This move results in immediate death. Eliminated.**\n\n#### 3. LEFT\n- New head position: (2, 7).\n- Cell (2, 7) is empty.\n- No immediate collision.\n- This move is safe but doesn't collect an apple.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT\n- New head position: (4, 7).\n- Cell (4, 7) contains an apple.\n- No collision with any snake body or head.\n- This move collects an apple and grows my snake.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves that collect apples. Let's evaluate further:\n\n- **UP Move:**\n  - Moves to (3, 8) and collects apple at (3, 8).\n  - After this move, my snake will be at [(3, 8), (3, 7)].\n  - Next turn, I can consider moves DOWN (backwards, forbidden), LEFT, or RIGHT.\n  - Options after UP: LEFT to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 8). Both are safe.\n\n- **RIGHT Move:**\n  - Moves to (4, 7) and collects apple at (4, 7).\n  - After this move, my snake will be at [(4, 7), (3, 7)].\n  - Next turn, I can consider moves LEFT (backwards, forbidden), UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n  - Options after RIGHT: UP to (4, 8), DOWN to (4, 6), or RIGHT to (5, 7). All are safe.\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of immediate safety and apple collection.\n\nHowever, looking at the board:\n- The apple at (4, 7) is adjacent to the enemy snake's head at (3, 3). If the enemy moves toward it (RIGHT to (4, 3)), it might create a risky situation.\n- The apple at (3, 8) is safer in terms of immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally beneficial, I will choose the one that moves toward the apple at (3, 8) to avoid potential conflict.\n\n### Final Plan\nCollect apple at (3, 8) by moving UP. This keeps my options open and avoids direct confrontation with the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

Survival high either way (y0 8/10 cols empty, can loop), but LEFT maximizes apple chance/options: post-eat at (2,3), head west to (0,6) apple (LEFT x2 UP x3, turn24 eat6) or north block (0,8)/(7,8) if enemy pivots.\n\n### Short-term plan\nLEFT to (2,0) start (2,3) path, lead4-1. Turn17: UP (2,1) advance no-eat, body (2,1)h-(2,0)-(3,0)-(3,1)-(3,2) vacates (3,3); options UP/LEFT/RIGHT safe. Turn18: UP (2,2), body (2,2)h-(2,1)-(2,0)-(3,0)-(3,1); continue UP. Turn19: UP (2,3) eat5 length6, body (2,3)h-(2,2)-(2,1)-(2,0)-(3,0)-(3,1); if enemy contested, accept win 4-1. Turn20: from (2,3) LEFT (1,3) empty toward col0 patrol/eat (0,6) turn24, or UP (2,4) empty scout center if enemy DOWN from (4,7). Monitor enemy: post-turn17 likely at (4,7) length3 eating2; if they DOWN-rushed (2,3) we won, else ignore top-right, farm left to7+ by turn30 denying <4 total. Survival: post-turn19 length6 y3 has 3+ options (LEFT/UP/RIGHT empty, DOWN (2,2) backward bad); space to evade if they commit south turn20+ (arrive y3 turn23 min, I length7 by then blocking).\n\nLEFT",

Enemy post-move vacates (3,6) regardless. Low collision risk; my length 6 edges short enemy for apple races.\n\n### Short-term plan\nUP (2,6) straight col2 r1-6 length6. Turn22: LEFT (1,6) toward (0,6) (clear; alt UP (2,7) if enemy veers west). Turn23: LEFT (0,6) eat (length7). Turn24: UP (0,7). Turn25: UP (0,8) eat (length8, secure west flank). Then pivot east: RIGHT x6 to (6,5) or UP-RIGHT to (7,8) (4-5 moves, arrive ~turn30 length9-10). Monitor enemy: if RIGHT/UP east, uncontested west farm widens lead to 8-2+; if DOWN south, block (6,5)/(6,0) post-west. Avoid RIGHT now; reassess if enemy suicides (unlikely).\n\nUP",

This is a direct self-collision and results in death. Eliminated.\n\n**Remaining Moves:**\nLet's analyze the three remaining moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n   - **Collision Check**: The cell (6, 7) is empty. No immediate collision.\n   - **Future Moves**: From (6, 7), my available moves next turn would be UP to (6, 8), DOWN to (6, 6), and RIGHT to (7, 7). All are open. This is a good, open move.\n   - **Apple Proximity**: This is a strong candidate as there is an apple directly above at (6, 8), one move away (UP).\n\n2. **Move UP to (5, 8):**\n   - **Collision Check**: The cell (5, 8) is empty. No immediate collision.\n   - **Future Moves**: From (5, 8), moves would be UP to (5, 9) (open), DOWN to my neck (5, 7) (forbidden), LEFT to (4, 8) (open), and RIGHT to (6, 8) (open). This is also a good move with multiple options.\n   - **Apple Proximity**: There is an apple at (6, 8). This move gets me closer to it in terms of Y-coordinate.\n\n3. **Move DOWN to (5, 6):**\n   - **Collision Check**: The cell (5, 6) is empty. No direct collision.\n   - **Future Moves**: From (5, 6), moves would be UP back to my head's current location (forbidden), DOWN to (5, 5) (open), LEFT to (4, 6) (open), and RIGHT to (6, 6) (open). This is also a safe move.\n   - **Apple Proximity**: This move does not bring me particularly close to any nearby apples.\n\n### Evaluation of Opponent (Snake #0)\n- Snake #0's head is at (2, 6).\n- Its body is a vertical line from (2, 1) up to (2, 5).\n- This means its possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, and UP. It is not in immediate threat of moving into my space, and its position is not constraining my options.\n\n### Strategic Plan\n- My objective is to safely acquire more apples. The closest ones are (6, 8) and (6, 5).\n  - Moving RIGHT to (6, 7) positions me perfectly to get the (6, 8) apple by moving UP on the next turn.\n  - Moving UP to (5, 8) also positions me well to get the (6, 8) apple, but requires an extra RIGHT move.\n- The RIGHT move is the most direct path to the nearest, high-value apple at (6, 8) and expands my headroom for future moves.\n- The DOWN move leads away from the apples and into a less strategically favorable corridor.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe RIGHT move is the best option. It is safe, opens up future possibilities, and directly targets an apple for collection.\n\nRIGHT",

The LEFT move would cause a conflict over the apple at (0, 6), but not directly with me.\n\n### Strategic Plan\nMy primary goal is to continue collecting apples safely while staying mobile.\n- I have two strong move options this turn:\n  - Move UP to (6, 8) and collect the apple. This increases my score immediately and opens up a path toward more apples.\n  - Move RIGHT to (7, 7), setting up to collect the apple at (7, 8) next turn.\n\nBoth are viable, but moving UP to collect the apple at (6, 8) is the more aggressive and beneficial move. It increases my apple count, which is critical for winning, and positions me well for future apple collection. The immediate gain outweighs the alternative.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe UP move is the best option. It is safe, directly collects an apple, and improves my position.\n\nUP",

Viable.\n\n2. **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n   - Cell is empty. No collision. \u2705\n   - Future moves from (5, 8):\n     - DOWN: to (5, 7) \u2013 self-collision \u274c\n     - UP: to (5, 9) \u2013 open \u2705\n     - LEFT: to (4, 8) \u2013 open \u2705\n     - RIGHT: back to head origin (6, 8) \u2013 forbidden\n   - Keeps mobility, but no immediate apple path.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n   - Cell contains apple. \u2705\n   - Collects the apple, grows tail. Immediate benefit. \u2705\n   - New head: (7, 8)\n   - Future moves post-collection:\n     - UP: to (7, 9) \u2013 open \u2705\n     - DOWN: to (7, 7) \u2013 open \u2705\n     - LEFT: back to (6, 8) \u2013 previous head, becomes new body segment \u2705\n     - RIGHT: to (8, 8) \u2013 open \u2705\n   - Strong positional improvement and direct benefit.\n\n#### Opponent Snake #0 Assessment:\n- Snake #0\u2019s head at (0, 6).\n- Long vertical body down to (2, 2).\n- Likely paths:\n  - RIGHT to (1, 6) \u2013 into its own body \u274c\n  - LEFT to (0, 6) \u2013 apple \u2013 contested move possible\n  - UP to (0, 7) \u2013 open\n\nNo immediate threat to me.\n\n### Strategic Plan:\nCollecting the apple at (7, 8) by moving RIGHT gives immediate benefit and improves positioning for future maneuvers. It maintains mobility and sets up for further apple paths. My longer-term objective is to grow efficiently while boxing out the opponent from the richer apple zones.\n\nRIGHT",
