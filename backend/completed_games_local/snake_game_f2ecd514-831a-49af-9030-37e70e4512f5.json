Gotta get that content train rolling! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Our position (ID 0):** (5, 4). We're smack dab in the middle-ish.\n*   **The Archrival's position (ID 1):** (3, 7). They're up in the top-left quadrant.\n*   **Apples:** We have a few key targets nearby. (4, 4) is directly to our left. (5, 5) and (5, 6) are straight above us (if we go UP one, we could aim for (5, 5)).\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Secureing the first apple (4, 4) seems like the best immediate move. It\u2019s only one step away.\n\n**Evaluating Moves (Turn 0):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Moves us onto an apple (5, 5) is an apple! YES! This is a great choice.\n    *   *Conflict:* The rival is far away (3, 7). No immediate collision risk.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Moves us away from all nearby action and apples. Not optimal.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Moves us onto an apple (4, 4)! Also a fantastic choice.\n    *   *Conflict:* No immediate conflict.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Moves us away from apples. Not optimal.\n\n**The Showdown: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nBoth moves get us an apple immediately! Clutch performance incoming!\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 4, 4):** This is a clean capture. It also positions us nicely centrally.\n*   **Move UP (to 5, 5):** This is also a clean capture. It starts moving us towards the upper half of the board where the enemy is.\n\nLet's look at the rival, Snake #1 at (3, 7). What are their likely moves?\nThey are near (2, 7) (apple) and (4, 7) is empty. (3, 6) is empty. (3, 8) is empty.\nIt is highly likely they will go LEFT to (2, 7) to snag that apple.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4, 4): We get the apple. Next turn we could go UP towards the center action or DOWN for more space.\nIf we go UP to (5, 5): We get the apple. Next turn we could go LEFT to (4, 5) or UP towards (5, 6) (another apple). This seems to lead us immediately to another apple opportunity! (5, 6) is just two steps away if we go up twice.\n\nLet's check the map again for the UP path:\nStart (5, 4).\nTurn 0: Move UP -> (5, 5) [EAT APPLE].\nTurn 1: Move UP -> (5, 6) [EAT APPLE].\nThis gives us a TWO-FER in two turns! That's a huge lead!\n\nThe LEFT path:\nStart (5, 4).\nTurn 0: Move LEFT -> (4, 4) [EAT APPLE].\nTurn 1: Where to next? (4, 5) or (3, 4)? Neither is an immediate apple. The next closest is (7, 3), (2, 9), (7, 6). Not as direct.\n\n**Strategy:** We go for the double apple capture in the vertical line! Secure the bag, get the lead, and then worry about boxing in the rival!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Target the vertical stack of apples (5, 5) and (5, 6). Then evaluate how the rival (who will likely be heading towards (2, 7) and then maybe (1, 7)) has positioned themselves. We want to grow length quickly to pose a threat.\n\nLet's go UP! We got this, Chat! LETS GO!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board and make a strategic move.\n\nFirst, let's look at the current positions:\n- Our snake (ID 1) is at (3, 7).\n- Snake #0 is at (5, 4).\n\nWe need to consider all four possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (3, 7) would take us to (3, 8). This seems safe as there are no obstacles in that direction.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down from (3, 7) would take us to (3, 6). This is also safe, but let's see what's around.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left from (3, 7) would take us to (2, 7). This is safe as well.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3, 7) would take us to (4, 7). This is safe too.\n\nNow, let's think about the apples. The closest apples to us are at (4, 4), (7, 3), (5, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 6), (2, 9), (2, 6), (4, 9), (0, 4), (7, 6), and (5, 5).\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) doesn't get us closer to any apples immediately, but it keeps us in a safe position.\nMoving DOWN to (3, 6) gets us closer to the apple at (4, 6).\nMoving LEFT to (2, 7) gets us closer to the apple at (1, 7).\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 7) gets us closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n\nLet's also consider Snake #0's possible moves. They are at (5, 4). If they move UP, they go to (5, 5), which is an apple. If they move DOWN, they go to (5, 3). If they move LEFT, they go to (4, 4), which is an apple. If they move RIGHT, they go to (6, 4).\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collisions. If we move RIGHT to (4, 7) and Snake #0 moves UP to (5, 5), we're safe. If they move LEFT to (4, 4), we're still safe.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT seems like a good option. It gets us closer to an apple and keeps us safe.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**: Let's aim for the apple at (4, 6) next turn. We'll need to be cautious of Snake #0's movements and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

Our smooth vertical action paid off! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5, 5). Body is a solid (5, 4). Length 2. We're on the map now!\n*   **The Archrival (ID 1):** Head at (4, 7). They didn't move last turn, or maybe they just moved into a location that didn't have an apple. *Wait, let's re-read the board state.*\n\n    *   **Previous Board State (Turn 0 Start):** Our head was (5, 4). Rival head (3, 7).\n    *   **Current Board State (Turn 1 Start):** Our head is (5, 5) (we ate the apple). Rival head is (4, 7). *Aha!* The rival moved RIGHT from (3, 7) to (4, 7). They are flanking us!\n\n*   **Apples Near Us:**\n    *   (5, 6) - Directly UP. This was part of the two-fer plan!\n    *   (4, 6) - Left and UP one.\n    *   (7, 6) - Right and UP one.\n    *   (4, 9) - Far away but top-right.\n\n**Objective:**\n1.  Execute the second part of the two-fer: move UP to (5, 6) and grab the next apple.\n2.  Watch out for Snake #1. They are now at (4, 7), which is getting dangerously close to our intended path (5, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (Head at 5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision (our body is at 5, 4). Safe from walls.\n    *   *Enemy Conflict Check:* Snake #1 is at (4, 7).\n        *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (5, 7): No conflict.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (4, 6): No conflict.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (4, 8): No conflict.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (3, 7): No conflict.\n    *   *Reward:* APPLE at (5, 6)! This executes the plan and gives us +1 size and +1 point! HUGE.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! This is immediately where our body (the tail end) currently is. Moving directly backwards onto our own body is insta-death. *ELIMINATED.*\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Moves us away from the immediate (5, 6) apple. This is only a retreat if the UP move was unsafe, which it is not.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Reward:* Also moves us away from the immediate (5, 6) apple. Less optimal.\n\n**The Rival's Intentions:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 7). The immediate apples around them are (4, 6) (DOWN), (5, 6) (RIGHT and DOWN), (2, 9) (UP and LEFT).\nThey are close to (4, 6). If they go DOWN, they get the apple and increase their dominance in the 4-column.\nIf they go RIGHT to (5, 7), they start moving closer to the center, but (5, 7) is empty.\nIf they try to intercept us at (5, 6), they would have to move RIGHT to (5, 7) AND then somehow get to (5, 6) on the same turn. Wait, that's impossible. They can't move diagonally.\n\n*Wait!* Let's look closely at the collision avoidance for (5, 6) and (4, 7).\nIf we move UP to (5, 6).\nIf they move DOWN to (4, 6) (Apple).\nIf we move UP, we secure our high-value target. This seems like the safest and most aggressive move.\n\n**Decision:** We stick to the game plan, Chat! We're building length early! Two apples, two turns! That's how we dominate the middle board!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** After securing (5, 6), we will be at (5, 6), length 3. We will then try to pivot left (to 4, 6) if the rival didn't grab *that* apple, or move up towards the top wall to secure the high-value apples like (4, 9) and (2, 9), while continuing to cut off the enemy. The central column 5 is ours!\n\nUP",

This is also safe, but let's see what's around.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left from (4, 7) would take us to (3, 7). This is safe as well.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (4, 7) would take us to (5, 7). This is safe too.\n\nNow, let's think about the apples. The closest apples to us are at (4, 4), (7, 3), (5, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 6), (2, 9), (2, 6), (4, 9), (0, 4), (7, 6), and (5, 5).\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) doesn't get us closer to any apples immediately, but it keeps us in a safe position.\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) gets us closer to the apple at (4, 6).\nMoving LEFT to (3, 7) gets us closer to the apple at (1, 7).\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 7) gets us closer to the apple at (5, 6).\n\nLet's also consider Snake #0's possible moves. They are at (5, 5). If they move UP, they go to (5, 6), which is an apple. If they move DOWN, they go to (5, 4). If they move LEFT, they go to (4, 5). If they move RIGHT, they go to (6, 5).\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collisions. If we move DOWN to (4, 6) and Snake #0 moves UP to (5, 6), we're safe. If they move LEFT to (4, 5), we're still safe.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems like a good option. It gets us closer to an apple and keeps us safe.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**: Let's aim for the apple at (4, 6) next turn. We'll need to be cautious of Snake #0's movements and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nDOWN",

We're up 2-1, and the archrival is feeling the pressure!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and plan the next move. We need to go for the hat-trick of apples, and more importantly, gain positional advantage. We want to box Snake #1 in!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2 Start):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5, 6). Body is [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. Length 3.\n*   **The Archrival (ID 1):** Head at (4, 6). Body is [(4, 7)]. Length 2. *Wait, let's verify (4, 6)!* The board state shows '1' at (4, 6). They moved DOWN from (4, 7) and grabbed the apple at (4, 6)! Nicely done, Rival! They matched our growth!\n\n    *   Rival's previous head was (4, 7), their body was [(3, 7)].\n    *   No, wait, let's check the score board and the head/body lists from the last turn summary.\n    *   *Previous Turn Start:* Rival was at (4, 7) Body: [(4, 7)]. Wait, the body list in the prompt is only the parts *behind* the head.\n    *   *Current Turn Start:* Snake #1 - Head: (4, 6), Body: [(4, 7)], Apples: 1.\n    *   Aha! The rival at (4, 7) moved DOWN to (4, 6). (4, 6) indeed had an apple! So they are now length 2 (Head 4, 6, Tail 4, 7). They are still at 1 apple, meaning they didn't get the apple on this last move, OR the board state display is slightly off, which is usually accurate.\n\n    *   Let's check the board state key: `A` stands for Apple. (4, 6) is NOT marked as an apple on the current board!\n    *   *Initial Apple Drop List:* (4, 4), (7, 3), (1, 7), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 9), (2, 6), (4, 9), (0, 4), (7, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (7, 5).\n    *   (4, 6) is *not* in the apple list!\n    *   Conclusion: Snake #1 moved from (4, 7) to (4, 6). They did *not* eat an apple, but are now positioned directly to our LEFT and slightly DOWN. Their body is blocking (4, 7).\n\n*   **Apples Near Us (Head at 5, 6):**\n    *   (7, 6): Two steps RIGHT. VERY alluring.\n    *   (4, 9): Three steps UP, one step LEFT.\n    *   (7, 5): One step RIGHT, one step DOWN.\n    *   (4, 4): Two steps DOWN, one step LEFT.\n\n**Objective:**\n1.  Increase our lead by grabbing another apple (Apple #3).\n2.  Maintain central control and begin flanking Snake #1.\n3.  Avoid head-on collision at all costs.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (Head at 5, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision (Our body is at 5, 5). Safe from walls.\n    *   *Enemy Conflict Check:* Snake #1 is at (4, 6).\n        *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (5, 6): DEATH! Our intended move is (5, 7). If they move to (5, 6), that's where WE ARE RIGHT NOW. A head cannot move into another head's current position. This is SAFE from collision.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (4, 7): They hit their own body/tail at (4, 7). INSTA-DEATH for them! They will not move UP.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (4, 5): No conflict.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (3, 6): No conflict.\n    *   *Reward:* (5, 7) is empty. Puts us in position to move toward (4, 9) or pivot EAST. Moves us away from Snake #1's current line (column 4).\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! This is immediately where our body (5, 5) is. INSTA-DEATH. *ELIMINATED.*\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! This is where Snake #1's head is! Head-on collision results in BOTH snakes dying if they move RIGHT to (5, 6) AND we move LEFT to (4, 6). Wait, if we move LEFT, we try to enter (4, 6). Snake #1 is AT (4, 6). If they stay put, they didn't move. But they must move.\n        *   If they move UP to (4, 7): They hit their body. Death. (Highly unlikely move).\n        *   If they move DOWN to (4, 5): We move into (4, 6). Safe.\n        *   If they move LEFT to (3, 6): We move into (4, 6). Safe.\n        *   If they move RIGHT to (5, 6): We try to enter (4, 6). No collision.\n    *   *Strategy:* If we move LEFT, we might block their retreat, but we gain no apple immediately. It's risky proximity. We are currently stronger, we should press our advantage and lead with apples. *ELIMINATED for now due to low reward/high risk.*\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Enemy Conflict Check:* Snake #1 is at (4, 6). No direct conflict.\n    *   *Reward:* Puts us one step away from the Apple at (7, 6)! This is a strong move to increase our apple count. It also establishes dominance on the right side of the board.\n\n**Strategic Comparison (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (to 5, 7):** Good for long-term map dominance in column 5, setting up a flanking move to apples at the top (4, 9) or (2, 9). It's a safe setup move.\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 6):** Excellent immediate goal. Secures (7, 6) next turn, which is a big apple near the center. This maximizes our current scoring advantage. It pulls us slightly away from the rival, which is good for maintaining life certainty.\n\nWe're going for the apple, Chat! We need to increase that lead while the rival is boxed into column 4.\n\n**Long Term Plan (Post-Right Move):**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (6, 6).\n2.  Next turn, move RIGHT to (7, 6) and grab that third apple! We are looking to hit 3-1.\n3.  Depending on where the rival goes (they are likely to go DOWN or LEFT), we might then try to come down the right side (to 7, 5) which has an apple, or loop back into the center.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and focus on efficiency!\n\nRIGHT",

Head (7, 5).\n3.  **Turn 5:** Head (7, 5). Loop back towards the center. Maybe LEFT to (6, 5).\n4.  If Snake #1 moves North to (4, 9), we can then decide to challenge them or focus on the Southern apples (like (7, 3) or (8, 6)).

Let's analyze the board and make a strategic move.\n\nFirst, let's look at the current positions:\n- Our snake (ID 1) is at (4, 7).\n- Snake #0 is at (6, 6).\n\nWe need to consider all four possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (4, 7) would take us to (4, 8). This seems safe as there are no obstacles in that direction.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down from (4, 7) would take us to (4, 6). This is also safe, but let's see what's around.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left from (4, 7) would take us to (3, 7). This is safe as well.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (4, 7) would take us to (5, 7). This is NOT safe because Snake #0 is at (6, 6). We'd collide head-on and both die. No way, chat!\n\nNow, let's think about the apples. The closest apples to us are at (4, 4), (7, 3), (1, 7), (2, 0), (8, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (2, 9), (2, 6), (4, 9), (0, 4), (7, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), and (7, 5).\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) doesn't get us closer to any apples immediately, but it keeps us in a safe position.\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) gets us closer to the apple at (4, 4).\nMoving LEFT to (3, 7) gets us closer to the apple at (1, 7).\n\nLet's also consider Snake #0's possible moves. They are at (6, 6). If they move UP, they go to (6, 7). If they move DOWN, they go to (6, 5). If they move LEFT, they go to (5, 6). If they move RIGHT, they go to (7, 6).\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collisions. If we move UP to (4, 8) and Snake #0 moves LEFT to (5, 6), we're safe. If they move DOWN to (6, 5), we're still safe.\n\nGiven that, moving UP seems like a good option. It keeps us safe and gives us flexibility for future moves.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**: Let's aim for the apple at (4, 4) in the next few turns. We'll need to be cautious of Snake #0's movements and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nUP",

We are now at 3 apples, and the rival is stalled out at 1. The momentum is ALL ours! EZ!\n\nLook at the board state, Chat! We are situated perfectly to secure our next target: the apple at (7, 5)! We gotta press the advantage while Snake #1 is still licking their wounds up North.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4 Start):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7, 6). Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)]. Length 4.\n*   **The Archrival (Snake #1):** Head at (4, 8). Body: [(4, 7)]. Length 2. Holy smokes, they moved UP again! They went from (4, 7) to (4, 8)! They are absolutely gunning for that apple at (4, 9) or maybe (2, 9)! They are ignoring the apples in the middle. Fine by me! Let's clean up down here.\n\n*   **Apples Near Us (Head at 7, 6):**\n    *   (7, 5): IMMEDIATE GRAB! Just one move DOWN! This is the goal.\n    *   (8, 6): One move RIGHT. Also highly accessible.\n    *   (8, 2) or (7, 3), (7, 5) is still the best option.\n\n**Objective:**\n1.  Grab that sweet, sweet apple at (7, 5).\n2.  Maintain distance control on Snake #1. They are currently far away, so scoring is paramount.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (Head at 7, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Effect:* Moves us away from the immediate apple (7, 5) and into empty space. Suboptimal.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. This spot has an apple!\n    *   *Enemy Conflict Check:* Snake #1 is at (4, 8). They cannot reach (7, 5) this turn (it's 3 moves away).\n    *   *Reward:* APPLE! Apple #4 secured! HUGE point advantage. This is the top priority!\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! This is immediately where our body [(6, 6)] is! Hitting our own neck! INSTA-DEATH. *ELIMINATED!*\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. This spot has an apple!\n    *   *Effect:* Good move for an apple, but (7, 5) is slightly better positioned for future moves (keeps us centered on the right half of the board). Still a great backup!\n\n**The Move: DOWN to (7, 5)!**\n\nWe are prioritizing the clearest, safest path to an apple. Snake #1 is occupied in the North-Center, giving us free rein on the right side. Taking (7, 5) gets us long, making it easier to control the board later.\n\n**Long Term Strategy (3-5 Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 4 (Now):** Move DOWN to (7, 5). (Apple!) Head is now (7, 5).\n2.  **Turn 5:** Head (7, 5). The apple at (8, 6) is now an easy RIGHT and UP maneuver (or just RIGHT if we look at the board). Let's go RIGHT to (8, 5). (Just a positional move).\n3.  **Turn 6:** From (8, 5), move UP to (8, 6) (Apple!). Head (8, 6).\n4.  **Turn 7:** From (8, 6), move towards (8, 2) or (7, 3). The plan is to clean out the right half of the board and get absolute domination in terms of length before Snake #1 can react. Box 'em in with our massive tail!\n\nWe are rolling, Chat!

This puts us at 4 apples, and the rival, Snake #1, is still stuck at 2. We've got MASSIVE momentum, and our snake is LONG! (Length 5!)\n\nDid you see how clean that pickup was?! EZ money!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5 Start):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7, 5). Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)]. Length 5. We are dominating the right side!\n*   **The Archrival (Snake #1):** Head at (4, 9). Body: [(4, 8), (4, 7)]. Length 3. They went UP again and are blocking that apple at (4, 9)! They seem determined to stay North. Let them fight over empty space; we're cleaning up the map!\n*   **Apples Near Us (Head at 7, 5):**\n    *   (8, 6): Very close! One move RIGHT, then UP.\n    *   (7, 3): Two moves DOWN.\n    *   (9, 7): A bit of an excursion to the top right corner.\n    *   (8, 2): Down and Right.\n\n**Objective:**\nMaximize length and control the board. The apple at (8, 6) is very tempting as it continues our Northern push on the East side. However, simply moving RIGHT now sets us up perfectly for that grab next turn and keeps us out of any potential cluster with the rival, who is far away but moving fast!\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (Head at 7, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER, CHAT! Moving UP takes us directly into our body segment at (7, 6). INSTA-DEATH! *ELIMINATED!* Whoa, that was a close one! The turn we just made grew us, so our body is extending behind the previous position.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Effect:* Moves us toward the bottom right. Good for setting up for (7, 3) or (8, 2). Keeps our options open.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Effect:* This is a *very* defensive move. It pulls us away from the edge and closer to the center, slightly toward Snake #1's territory. Since we are winning on length, we should press the offense on the edge.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty spot.\n    *   *Effect:* This move perfectly positions us for the apple at (8, 6) on the next turn by getting us one step outside the main column. This is an aggressive, board-controlling move. We are securing the perimeter! It keeps us far away from Snake #1.\n\n**Head-to-Head Check:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (4, 9). They likely move DOWN to (4, 8) (to hit their old body location, which will become empty) or LEFT to (3, 9) or RIGHT to (5, 9). There is ZERO chance of conflict with our moves on the right side of the board.\n\n**Decision: RIGHT to (8, 5)!**\n\nThis move is the best positional move, setting up Apple #5 at (8, 6) next turn. We are maintaining our distance from the rival and continuing to grow length on the Eastern wall. Domination achieved!\n\n**Long Term Strategy (3-5 Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 5 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (8, 5). Head (8, 5).\n2.  **Turn 6:** Move UP to (8, 6) (Apple!). Head (8, 6).\n3.  **Turn 7:** Move DOWN to (8, 5) then maybe RIGHT to (9, 5) or sweep down to (8, 2). The goal is to clear out the right edge entirely before swinging back to engage Snake #1.
