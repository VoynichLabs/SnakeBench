There are apples at (5,1), (6,0), (7,8), (4,1), and (3,8).\n\nI need to move to a safe square.\n- Moving UP to (4,6): Safe.\n- Moving DOWN to (4,4): Safe.\n- Moving LEFT to (3,5): Safe.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,5): Safe.\n\nI want to collect apples to increase my score.\nThe nearest apples are at (5,1), (4,1), and (6,0).\nMoving DOWN towards y=1 or y=0 puts me closer to these apples.\nLet's check the board state around these targets.\nApple at (5,1): I am at (4,5). Distance is 1 in x, 4 in y. Manhattan distance 5.\nApple at (4,1): Distance is 0 in x, 4 in y. Manhattan distance 4.\nApple at (6,0): Distance is 2 in x, 5 in y. Manhattan distance 7.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,4) brings me closer to the apples at (5,1) and (4,1).\nMoving DOWN is safe.\n\nHowever, let's consider the enemy snake at (3,2).\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), I am at y=4. The enemy is at y=2.\nIf the enemy moves UP, it could go to (3,3).\nThere are no apples near me immediately, but going down towards y=1 seems like a good path to the apples at (5,1), (4,1), and (6,0).\n\nWait, let's look at the apple at (7,8) and (3,8).\nApple at (3,8) is 4 units up and 1 unit left. Manhattan distance 5.\nApple at (7,8) is 3 units up and 3 units right. Manhattan distance 6.\nApple at (5,1) is 1 unit right and 4 units down. Manhattan distance 5.\nApple at (4,1) is 3 units down. Manhattan distance 3.\nApple at (6,0) is 2 units right and 5 units down. Manhattan distance 7.\n\nClosest apple is (4,1) with distance 3.\nPath to (4,1):\n(4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1).\nAt (4,2), I need to be careful of the enemy at (3,2).\nIf the enemy moves right to (4,2), we collide and both die (if I am at head, he is head).\nSo moving down is safe for now. I will plan to go down.\n\nOne detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy body is empty, so this is not an issue.\n\nLet's verify the \"Down\" move again.\n(4,5) -> (4,4).\nIs (4,4) on the board? Yes (0..9).\nIs (4,4) occupied by any snake body? No.\nIs (4,4) occupied by my own body? No.\nIs it an enemy head? No (Enemy is at (3,2)).\nIs it moving backwards? No body.\n\nIt seems safe.\nIs there a better move?\nApple at (4,1) is closest.\nApple at (5,1) is also close.\nApple at (6,0) is a bit far.\nGoing down is the correct choice to approach the apples in the south.\n\nLet's consider if the enemy might move UP to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,2).\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), and enemy moves UP to (3,3), no collision.\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), and enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2), no collision.\nIf I move DOWN to (4,4), and enemy moves UP-LEFT (impossible) or UP-RIGHT (impossible).\nSo DOWN seems safe.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,8). Distance 5.\nLet's consider the apple at (4,1). Distance 3.\nGoing down is the shortest path to the closest apple.\n\nI will choose DOWN.\n\nOne check: The apple at (5,1) is \"A A\" at 5,1 and 6,0? No, the prompt says Apples at: (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 8), (4, 1), (3, 8).\nThe board state shows:\nRow 1: \". . . . A A . . . .\"\nColumns are 0 to 9.\n(4,1) is 'A'.\n(5,1) is 'A'.\nRow 0: \". . . . . . A . . .\"\n(6,0) is 'A'.\nRow 8: \". . . A . . . A . .\"\n(3,8) is 'A'.\n(7,8) is 'A'.\n\nThe closest apple is (4,1) at distance 3.\nThe next closest is (5,1) at distance 5.\nThe next is (6,0) at distance 7.\nThen (3,8) at distance 5.\nThen (7,8) at distance 6.\n\nSo moving DOWN is definitely the best choice to reach the apple at (4,1).\n\nI will write a plan to move down towards the apples at (4,1) and (5,1).\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought_process\": \"I am at (4,5). The closest apple is at (4,1), distance 3. Moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe and directly reduces the distance to the closest apple. The enemy snake is at (3,2), which is not in the immediate path of my move DOWN. Moving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT would increase the distance to the nearest apples.\",\n  \"plan\": \"Move DOWN to get closer to the apples at (4,1) and (5,1). Avoid the enemy at (3,2).\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the prompt asks for the final line to be exactly the word.\nI should put the plan before the move, and the move on the last line.\n\nLet me double check the board coordinates.\n0 is bottom left? No, \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nAnd \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used.\"\nWait, usually X is horizontal (columns) and Y is vertical (rows).\nRow 9 is top. Row 0 is bottom.\nSo (x,y) means column x, row y.\nMy position is (4,5). That is column 4, row 5.\nRow 5 on the board is:\n\"5 . . . . 0 . . . .\"\nYes, the '0' is at index 4 (column 4).\nSo my coordinates are correct.\n\nMoving DOWN means decreasing y.\n(4,5) -> (4,4).\nRow 4 is:\n\"4 . . . . . . . . . .\"\nAll empty. Safe.\n\nMoving UP means increasing y.\n(4,5) -> (4,6).\nRow 6 is:\n\"6 . . . . . . . . . .\"\nAll empty. Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT means decreasing x.\n(4,5) -> (3,5).\nRow 5, index 3 is '.'.\nSafe.\n\nMoving RIGHT means increasing x.\n(4,5) -> (5,5).\nRow 5, index 5 is '.'.\nSafe.\n\nAll moves are safe in terms of walls and bodies.\nBut I want to go to the apples.\nApples are at:\n(5,1) - Column 5, Row 1.\n(6,0) - Column 6, Row 0.\n(7,8) - Column 7, Row 8.\n(4,1) - Column 4, Row 1.\n(3,8) - Column 3, Row 8.\n\nI am at Row 5.\nApples are at Row 1 (Down) and Row 8 (Up).\nDistance to Row 1: 4 steps.\nDistance to Row 8: 3 steps.\nSo Row 8 is closer by 1 step.\nHowever, the prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates\". Usually Y is vertical.\nIf Y is vertical, then increasing Y is UP.\nLet's re-read the prompt.\n\"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\"Normal X,Y coordinates are used.\"\nSo (x, y).\ny=0 is bottom.\ny=9 is top.\nSo UP increases y.\nDOWN decreases y.\n\nMy position: (4,5).\nTarget (3,8): y=8. Target is 3 units UP.\nTarget (7,8): y=8. Target is 3 units UP.\nTarget (4,1): y=1. Target is 4 units DOWN.\nTarget (5,1): y=1. Target is 4 units DOWN.\nTarget (6,0): y=0. Target is 5 units DOWN.\n\nSo the apples at y=8 are closer (distance 3) than the apples at y=1 (distance 4).\nWait, the board shows:\nRow 8: \". . . A . . . A . .\"\nThis corresponds to (3,8) and (7,8).\nRow 1: \". . . . A A . . . .\"\nThis corresponds to (4,1) and (5,1).\nRow 0: \". . . . . . A . . .\"\nThis corresponds to (6,0).\n\nDistance from (4,5):\nTo (3,8): |4-3| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nTo (7,8): |4-7| + |5-8| = 3 + 3 = 6.\nTo (4,1): |4-4| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4.\nTo (5,1): |4-5| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\nTo (6,0): |4-6| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nSo (3,8) and (4,1) are tied for distance (4).\n(3,8) is UP and LEFT.\n(4,1) is DOWN.\n\nLet's look at the enemy snake at (3,2).\nIf I go UP towards (3,8), I might cross paths with the enemy if he goes Up.\nIf I go DOWN towards (4,1), I am moving away from the enemy (y=2 vs y=5).\n\nBut wait, I am at (4,5). The board shows:\nRow 5: . . . . 0 . . . . .\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2: . . . 1 . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . A A . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . . .\n\nIf I go UP to (4,6):\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nIf I go UP to (4,7):\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\nIf I go UP to (4,8):\nRow 8: . . . A . . . A . .\nAt (4,8) there is no apple. The apple is at (3,8) and (7,8).\nSo from (4,8), I can go LEFT to (3,8) to eat the apple.\nDistance: (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8). That's 4 moves.\nThen I eat the apple at (3,8).\n\nIf I go DOWN:\n(4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1).\nAt (4,1) there is an apple.\nDistance: 4 moves.\nBut wait, at (4,2), I am next to the enemy at (3,2).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2) at the same time I move DOWN to (4,2), we collide and both die.\nThe enemy is at (3,2). The apple is at (4,1).\nIf I am at (4,1) and the enemy is at (3,2), I am safe from collision (head vs body? No, heads can eat heads).\nThe prompt says: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies...\"\nSo if I am at (4,2) and enemy moves to (4,2), we both die.\nIf I am at (4,2) and enemy moves to (3,2) (stays), I am safe.\nIf I am at (4,2) and enemy moves to (3,3), I am safe.\n\nLet's consider the UP path.\n(4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8).\nIs this path safe?\nRow 6 is empty.\nRow 7 is empty.\nRow 8 has 'A' at (3,8) and (7,8).\n(4,8) is empty.\n(3,8) is the apple.\nThe enemy is at (3,2).\nIf the enemy goes UP, he goes to (3,3), (3,4), etc.\nTo collide with me on the UP path, he would have to be at (3,8) when I arrive, or be at (4,8) when I am at (4,8).\nHe starts at (3,2).\nHe needs to move 6 steps up to reach (3,8).\nI need 4 steps to reach (3,8).\nSo I will reach the apple first.\nHowever, collision only happens if we arrive at the SAME cell at the SAME turn.\nI arrive at (3,8) on turn 4 (from my perspective).\nIf the enemy moves up 4 times, he will be at (3,6).\nSo no collision.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT?\n(3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) -> (7,2) -> ...\nIf he goes right, he is moving towards the right side.\nI am moving up to (4,6) etc. He is at y=2. I am at y=5,6...\nWe are separated by y-distance.\nIf I am at (4,8), he would need to be at (4,8) to collide.\nHe would need to go (3,2) -> ... -> (4,8). That's a lot of moves.\n\nLet's compare UP and DOWN again.\nUP leads to (3,8) with 4 moves. Distance 4.\nDOWN leads to (4,1) with 4 moves. Distance 4.\n\nHowever, the DOWN path brings me close to the enemy at (3,2).\nAt turn 1, I am at (4,4). Enemy could be at (3,3) or (4,2).\nAt turn 2, I am at (4,3). Enemy could be at (3,4) or (4,2) or (5,2).\nAt turn 3, I am at (4,2).\nIf the enemy is at (3,3) and moves RIGHT to (4,3), we collide? No, I would be at (4,2), he at (4,3).\nIf the enemy is at (4,2) (from moving right previous turn), and I move to (4,2), we collide.\nSo if the enemy moves RIGHT at turn 1, he is at (4,2).\nIf he moves RIGHT again at turn 2, he is at (5,2).\nIf he moves RIGHT at turn 3, he is at (6,2).\nIf he moves UP at turn 1, he is at (3,3).\nIf he moves UP at turn 2, he is at (3,4).\nIf he moves UP at turn 3, he is at (3,5).\nIf he moves UP at turn 4, he is at (3,6).\nAt turn 4, I am at (4,1) (if I ate the apple, I grow next turn, but for collision check I am at (4,1)).\nAt turn 4, he is at (3,6).\nSafe.\n\nThe risk is if he moves RIGHT and I move DOWN, we might meet at (4,2) or (4,1) or (5,1)?\nIf he moves RIGHT 1 step: (4,2).\nIf I move DOWN 3 steps: (4,2).\nOn the same turn (Turn 3 of my path), I arrive at (4,2), he arrives at (4,2). Collision.\nSo if he sees me going down, and he wants to kill me, he can go right and meet me at (4,2).\nIs (4,2) an apple? No.\nWhy would he go there? To kill me.\nBut maybe he doesn't want to die? If he kills me, he dies too (head-on collision).\nUnless he thinks I am going to eat an apple at (4,1) and grow?\nActually, if we collide, we both die.\nIf he doesn't want to die, he won't go there.\nBut we don't know his strategy.\nHowever, going UP to (3,8) puts me in a region with no enemy nearby.\nEnemy is at (3,2).\nIf he goes UP, he goes to (3,3)... towards me? No, I am at y=5..8. He is at y=2.\nIf he goes UP, he increases the y-distance from 3 to 4, 5...\nIf he goes RIGHT, he increases x-distance.\n\nThe UP path seems safer because there are no obstacles and the enemy is far away.\nThe DOWN path passes near the enemy starting position.\nAlso, there are two apples in the UP direction (at 3,8 and 7,8).\nThere are two apples in the DOWN direction (at 4,1 and 5,1).\nDistance to nearest in UP: 4.\nDistance to nearest in DOWN: 4.\n\nLet's look at the \"Rules and win conditions\".\n\"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\"\n\nThe UP region (rows 5-9) seems open.\nThe DOWN region (rows 0-5) has the enemy near (3,2).\nIf I go down, I might get into a fight or a trap.\nIf I go up, I have a clear path to (3,8).\nAlso, if I go UP, I am moving towards the top center.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards the bottom center.\nThe enemy is at (3,2). Bottom left area.\nIf I go DOWN, I am approaching the enemy's area.\nIf I go UP, I am moving away.\n\nLet's verify the board again.\nRow 8 has apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\nRow 1 has apples at (4,1) and (5,1).\nRow 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nIf I go UP:\nPath: (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8).\nI eat the apple at (3,8).\nThen I am at (3,8). My tail will be at (4,7) (assuming I grew from the apple).\nWait, I start with no body.\nTurn 0: Me at (4,5). No body.\nMove UP to (4,6). Still no body.\nMove UP to (4,7).\nMove UP to (4,8).\nMove LEFT to (3,8). Eat apple.\nNOW I grow. My body becomes: Head (3,8), Tail (4,8).\nNext turn, I can move. Maybe to (2,8) or (3,7) or (4,8) (backwards? No).\nI can go to (2,8) (Left) or (3,7) (Down).\nFrom there I can see the other apple at (7,8) (Right) or (3,7) (Down).\n(7,8) is 4 units away from (3,8).\n(4,1) is... if I am at (3,8), distance to (4,1) is |3-4| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8. Far.\n\nIf I go DOWN:\nPath: (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1). Eat apple.\nGrowth: Head (4,1), Tail (4,2).\nFrom (4,1), I can go to (5,1) (Right, eat another apple!) or (4,0) (Down) or (3,1) (Left).\n(5,1) is an apple!\nSo if I go DOWN, I can potentially eat (4,1) then (5,1) quickly.\n(4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent!\nWait, the board shows:\nRow 1: . . . . A A . . . .\n(4,1) is A.\n(5,1) is A.\nSo they are right next to each other.\nIf I go DOWN, I can eat (4,1) then immediately turn RIGHT to eat (5,1).\nThat's 2 apples in 5 turns (4 to get to 4,1, then 1 to get to 5,1).\n\nIf I go UP, I eat (3,8). Then I have to turn around or go to (7,8).\n(7,8) is far. (7,8) - (3,8) = 4 units x.\nIf I go (3,8) -> (4,8) -> (5,8) -> (6,8) -> (7,8).\nThat's 4 more moves.\nSo UP path: 4 moves + 4 moves = 8 moves for 2 apples.\nDOWN path: 4 moves + 1 move = 5 moves for 2 apples.\n\nDOWN path is much faster for getting points.\nBut is it safe?\nEnemy at (3,2).\nIf I go DOWN, I end up at (4,1).\nMy tail will be at (4,2).\nEnemy is at (3,2).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2), he hits my tail.\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nSo if enemy moves to (4,2), he dies. I live.\nIf enemy moves to (4,1), he hits my head.\nIf we both move to (4,1) at the same time? He starts at (3,2). He needs 2 moves (R, R? No, R then R? He is at (3,2). To (4,1) requires R then D? No. (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1). That's 2 moves.\nI need 4 moves to get to (4,1).\nSo on the turn I reach (4,1), he is 2 moves away if he goes R then D.\nIf he goes R then R, he is at (5,2).\nIf he goes U then U, he is at (3,4).\nSo he cannot reach (4,1) at the same time I do (Turn 4 for me).\nHe is at (3,2).\nIf he moves R (to 4,2) and I move D (to 4,4), no collision.\nIf he moves R (to 4,2) and I move D (to 4,3), no collision.\nIf he moves R (to 4,2) and I move D (to 4,2), we collide.\nWhen would I be at (4,2)? On Turn 3 of my path (Start (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2)).\nWhen would he be at (4,2)? If he moves R on Turn 0 (his turn 0).\nSo if he moves R NOW (Turn 0 of the game), he will be at (4,2) when I arrive at (4,2).\nThat is a head-on collision. We both die.\nHe is at (3,2). He might not want to die.\nBut he might not know I am coming?\nOr maybe he wants to kill me?\nIf he kills me, he dies too.\nIs it worth it for him? Probably not, unless he is desperate.\nBut I am at (4,5). He is at (3,2).\nIf he moves RIGHT, and I move DOWN, we both die.\nSo moving DOWN is risky if the enemy moves RIGHT.\nWhat if he moves UP?\n(3,2) -> (3,3). I am at (4,4). No collision.\nWhat if he moves LEFT?\n(3,2) -> (2,2). Safe.\nWhat if he moves DOWN?\n(3,2) -> (3,1). Safe.\n\nSo the only risky move for me is if he moves RIGHT.\nIs there any other way he can kill me?\nIf he moves UP and I move DOWN, we are separating.\nIf he moves LEFT and I move DOWN, we are separating.\nIf he moves DOWN and I move DOWN, we are separating.\n\nSo the question is: Will the enemy move RIGHT?\nThe enemy is at (3,2). There is an apple at (4,1).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he gets closer to the apple at (4,1) and (5,1).\nHe is at (3,2). (4,1) is distance |3-4| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n(5,1) is distance 2 + 1 = 3.\n(6,0) is distance 3 + 2 = 5.\n(3,8) is distance 0 + 6 = 6.\nSo for him, the apples at (4,1) and (5,1) are also very close!\nDistance 2.\nFor me, they are distance 4.\nSo he is CLOSER to those apples than I am.\nIf he wants those apples, he will likely move towards them.\nHe is at (3,2). (4,1) is (R, D).\nSo he needs to move RIGHT then DOWN.\nIf he moves RIGHT now, he goes to (4,2).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (4,4).\nNo collision yet.\nNext turn:\nHe is at (4,2). He might move DOWN to (4,1).\nI am at (4,4). I move DOWN to (4,3).\nNo collision.\nTurn after:\nHe is at (4,1) (eats apple).\nI am at (4,3). I move DOWN to (4,2).\nWait, if he eats the apple at (4,1), his body length becomes 1 (tail at (4,2)? No, he starts with no body. So if he eats at (4,1), his body is (4,1) -> (previous head). Previous head was (4,2) (if he moved R then D).\nLet's trace him.\nStart (3,2).\nTurn 0: Move RIGHT to (4,2). (No apple). Body: none.\nTurn 1: Move DOWN to (4,1). (Eats apple). Body grows. Head (4,1), Tail (4,2).\nTurn 2: He is at (4,1). I am... at (4,3) (if I moved D,D,D).\nIf I move DOWN to (4,2) on Turn 2, I hit his tail.\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies...\"\nWait. My head into his body = I die.\nIf I am at (4,2) and he is at (4,1) with body (4,2)...\nIf I move to (4,2), I hit his tail (body part). I DIE.\nSo if he moves RIGHT then DOWN, he claims the apple at (4,1) and his body blocks (4,2).\nThen I cannot go to (4,2).\nIf I am at (4,3), I cannot go DOWN to (4,2).\nI would be trapped or forced to go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSo if he goes for the apples at (4,1)/(5,1), he might cut me off.\nIf he goes for the apples at (3,8), he goes UP.\nIf he goes UP, I am safe to go DOWN (he is moving away).\nIf he goes RIGHT, he is contesting the DOWN apples.\n\nWhat if I go UP?\nI go to (3,8).\nHe goes... let's say he goes RIGHT (towards 4,1).\nThen we are far apart. I get (3,8). He gets (4,1).\nWe both score.\nIf he goes UP (towards 3,8), he goes to (3,3).\nI go to (4,6). We are diverging in X (I go 4->3, he stays 3?).\nI go (4,5)->(4,6)->(4,7)->(4,8)->(3,8).\nHe goes (3,2)->(3,3)->(3,4)->(3,5)->(3,6).\nAt turn 4, I am at (3,8). He is at (3,6).\nWe don't collide.\nIf he continues, he can reach (3,7), (3,8) on turn 6.\nBy then I have eaten the apple and my body is at (3,8) (head) and (4,8) (tail).\nIf he moves to (3,8), he hits my head. Head-on collision. We both die.\nSo if he contests the apple at (3,8), we both die.\nBut I get there first.\nSo UP is \"safe\" from collision (if he doesn't want to die).\n\nNow, compare RISK.\nDOWN: Risk of collision if he moves RIGHT.\nUP: Risk of collision only if he chases me all the way to (3,8), which is unlikely and results in both dying (which is bad for him, good for me? No, \"If all snakes die... game ends... snake with more apples wins\". We both have 0 apples. Draw. Or game continues next round? No, \"Game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples\". \"If all snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples wins\".\nSo if we both die, it's a draw (0 apples).\nSo he might not want to chase me to (3,8) to die.\n\nHowever, if I go DOWN and he goes RIGHT, we might collide at (4,2) or I get blocked.\nBut if he goes RIGHT, he is going for the apples.\nMaybe I should let him have the bottom apples and I go for the top ones?\nDistance to (3,8): 4 moves.\nDistance to (4,1): 4 moves.\nThey are the same distance.\nBut I am at (4,5). He is at (3,2).\nHe is CLOSER to (4,1).\n|3-4| + |2-1| = 2.\n|4-4| + |5-1| = 4.\nSo if we both race for (4,1), he wins.\nSo I should NOT race him for (4,1).\nI should go for (3,8) where I have a clear advantage (distance 4 vs his distance 6).\nOr I could go for (5,1) or (6,0)?\nDistance to (5,1): 5.\nDistance for him to (5,1): |3-5| + |2-1| = 2+1=3.\nHe wins that too.\nDistance to (6,0): 7.\nDistance for him to (6,0): |3-6| + |2-0| = 3+2=5.\nHe wins.\n\nSo the bottom cluster of apples (y=0,1) is closer to him.\nThe top cluster (y=8) is closer to me (distance 4) than to him (distance 6).\nTherefore, I should go UP to secure the apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Move UP towards (3,8).\n2. Eat (3,8).\n3. Move towards (7,8).\n\nThis strategy avoids conflict and secures points.\nIf I go DOWN, I risk collision or losing the race to the enemy.\nIf I go UP, I am safe and likely to score first.\n\nSo I will choose UP.\n\nWait, I need to make sure (4,6) is safe.\nRow 6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . .\"\nYes.\nAlso, I need to be sure the enemy isn't moving UP to (3,3) and I move UP to (4,6). No collision.\n\nFinal check on \"Moving directly backwards\".\nIf I were to move DOWN (to 4,4) then UP (back to 4,5), that would be backwards if I had a body.\nBut I have no body. So it's safe.\nBut I am choosing UP, so not relevant.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to reach the apples at (3,8) and (7,8) which are closer to me than to the enemy. Avoid the bottom region where the enemy is.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan\": \"Move UP towards the apples at (3,8) and (7,8). The bottom apples are closer to the enemy, so I should secure the top apples to avoid conflict.\"\n}\n```\n\nFinal move: UP.\n\nDouble check coordinates.\n(4,5) -> (4,6).\nY increases.\nCorrect.\n\nOne small detail: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\nIf I am at (4,5) and move UP to (4,6).\nEnemy is at (3,2).\nHe could move to (3,3), (4,2), (2,2), (3,1).\nNone of these are (4,6).\nSo safe.\n\nLet's write the response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan\": \"Move UP to get closer to the apples at (3,8) and (7,8), which are closer to me than to the enemy. This avoids potential conflict over the bottom apples.\"\n}\n```\nAnd the move is UP.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can include the JSON block (plan), the reasoning, and then the word UP.\n\nActually, the prompt says:\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should put the plan in a specific format? \"START LAST MOVE PICK ... END ...\"?\nNo, that was in the \"Your last move information\" section.\n\"I will show you... START LAST RATIONALE ... END ...\"\nSo I just need to write the plan text.\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo if I write the plan in my response, it will be saved as the rationale for the next turn.\nI should definitely write a plan.\n\nSo my response will be:\n[Reasoning...]\n[Plan...]\nUP\n\nLet's refine the plan.\n\"Move UP to (4,6). Plan: Target the apples at (3,8) and (7,8) in the top region, as they are closer to me than the bottom apples which are closer to the enemy at (3,2).\"\n\nIs \"UP\" the correct move to reach (3,8)?\n(4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8).\nYes.\n\nIs there any risk in moving UP?\nOnly if the enemy moves UP and I move UP, and we somehow end up in the same spot.\nHe is at (3,2). I am at (4,5).\nTo collide, he would need to move UP-RIGHT (impossible) or UP-UP-UP-RIGHT? No.\nSo UP is safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves UP to (3,3) and I move UP to (4,6)? No collision.\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2) and I move UP to (4,6)? No collision.\n\nOkay, confident in UP.\n\nOne final check on the \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nRow 9 is top right. Row 0 is bottom left.\nSo UP increases Y.\nYes.\n\nSo the move is UP.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan\": \"Move UP to approach the apples at (3,8) and (7,8). The enemy at (3,2) is closer to the bottom apples (4,1), so I will secure the top apples to avoid confrontation.\"\n}\n```\n\nFinal line: UP.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I cannot put the JSON block on the last line.\nI should put the reasoning and plan before the last word.\nIs JSON format acceptable? Yes, usually in these prompts.\nBut to be safe, maybe just text.\n\nText version of plan:\n\"Plan: Move UP to secure the apples at (3,8) and (7,8). The enemy is closer to the bottom apples, so I will avoid conflict by going up.\"\n\nLet's just output the text.\n\nWait, the user prompt starts with \"You are controlling a snake...\".\nI should respond as if I am the agent.\nI will explain my reasoning and then state the plan, then the move.\n\n\"Thinking out loud\":\nThe closest apples are at (3,8) and (4,1), both distance 4.\nHowever, the enemy is at (3,2), closer to the bottom apples (4,1), (5,1), (6,0).\nIf I go DOWN, I risk a race or collision.\nIf I go UP, I secure the top apples (3,8) and (7,8) where I have a positional advantage.\nTherefore, I will move UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to target the top apples at (3,8) and (7,8), avoiding conflict with the enemy who is positioned near the bottom apples.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nLet's write the final output.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"I am at (4,5).

Racing for bottom apples is risky. Going UP secures the top apples safely.\",\n  \"plan\": \"Move UP to get closer to the apples at (3,8) and (7,8).

Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis confirms UP increases Y.\n\nFinal check on \"Moving directly backwards\".\nIf I were to move DOWN then UP, that would be backwards when I have a body.\nBut I start with no body.\nIf I move UP to (4,6), then next turn if I move DOWN back to (4,5), is that allowed?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nIf I move UP to (4,6), my body becomes (4,5).\nIf I then move DOWN to (4,5), I am moving into the cell directly behind my head (which is now my body).\nSo yes, I would die.\nSo once I commit to a direction, I have to be careful not to turn around immediately.\nBut for this turn, just moving UP is fine.\n\nI will output the reasoning and plan in a text block, then the word UP.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought_process\": \"I am at (4,5).

I will move UP to approach (3,8) and (7,8).\",\n  \"plan\": \"Move UP to secure the top apples and avoid the enemy in the bottom-left quadrant.\"\n}\n```\nUP\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I should put the move on the last line.\nI will put the thought process and plan in the block above.\nAnd then the word UP.\n\nIs it okay to use JSON?\nYes, the system prompt implies it uses JSON or similar structured data.\nActually, looking at the examples in other tasks, usually just text is fine.\nI will use plain text for the thought process and plan.\n\nThought process:\nI am at (4,5). The apples are at (3,8), (7,8) (top) and (4,1), (5,1), (6,0) (bottom). The enemy is at (3,2). The enemy is much closer to the bottom apples (distance 2 to (4,1)) than I am (distance 4). The enemy is farther from the top apples (distance 6 to (3,8)) than I am (distance 4). Therefore, I should move UP to secure the top apples and avoid a conflict over the bottom apples.\n\nPlan: Move UP to get closer to the apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\n\nUP\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne small check: Is (4,6) empty?\nBoard state:\nRow 6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . .\"\nYes.\nIs (4,6) occupied by any snake body?\nMy body is none.\nEnemy body is none.\nIs (4,6) an enemy head?\nEnemy head is (3,2).\nSo (4,6) is safe.\n\nIs it possible the enemy moves to (3,8)?\nHe is at (3,2). Distance 6.\nI am at (4,5). Distance 4.\nI get there first.\nIf he moves there, we collide.\nIf he moves there, he dies (head-on collision).\nIf he doesn't want to die, he won't go there.\nIf he wants to kill me (and die), he might.\nBut that's a suicide play.\nUsually, we assume survival is preferred.\nBut the prompt says \"You cannot win if you are dead\".\nSo avoiding death is priority #1.\nSo I should assume he won't suicide.\nSo UP is safe.\n\nWhat if he moves UP to (3,3) and I move UP to (4,6).\nNo collision.\nWhat if he moves UP to (3,3), next turn UP to (3,4), next turn UP to (3,5)...\nI am at (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8).\nWe are getting closer in Y but X is 3 vs 4.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), he is at (3,5) or (3,6).\nWe don't collide.\nIf he goes LEFT? No, he is at x=3.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (4,5), etc.\nHe would have to go (3,2)->(3,3)->(3,4)->(3,5)->(3,6)->(3,7)->(3,8).\nBy then I am at (3,8).\nSo I get the apple.\nIf he continues to (3,8), he dies.\nSo I get the points, he dies.\nThat's a win for me.\n\nSo UP seems correct.\n\nFinal output construction:\n1. Reasoning text.\n2. Plan text.\n3. UP.\n\nI will write it clearly.\n\n```text\nI am at (4,5). The closest apples are at (3,8) and (4,1) (both distance 4). The enemy snake is at (3,2). The enemy is distance 2 from the bottom apple at (4,1), but distance 6 from the top apple at (3,8). This makes the bottom apples dangerous to pursue due to potential conflict or race conditions. The top apples are safer and within my reach. I will move UP to approach (3,8).\n\nPlan: Move UP to secure the top apples at (3,8) and (7,8), avoiding conflict with the enemy in the lower section of the board.\n```\nUP\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\nSo the text block is fine.\nThe plan is included in the text block.\nI will separate them slightly.\n\nActually, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nThis suggests the plan is distinct or can be part of the text.\nI will include a sentence that clearly states the plan.\n\nExample:\n\"My plan is to move UP to get the apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\"\n\nOkay, ready.\n\nOne last check on \"Normal X,Y coordinates\".\nIf X is horizontal and Y is vertical:\n(4,5) -> UP -> (4,6).\nYes.\n\nIf the coordinates were swapped (Y horizontal, X vertical):\nThen (4,5) would be row 5, col 4.\nBut the prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates\".\nAnd \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right\".\nThis matches the standard mathematical coordinate system (if y is vertical).\nSo X is horizontal index (0..9).\nY is vertical index (0..9).\nBoard visualization:\nRow 9 (top)\n...\nRow 0 (bottom)\nColumns 0..9.\nSo (4,5) is at column 4, row 5.\nMy move UP to (4,6) is column 4, row 6.\nRow 6 on the board is empty.\nCorrect.\n\nThe board shows:\n\" 9 . . . . . . . . . .\"\n\" 5 . . . . 0 . . . . .\"\nSo the '0' is at index 4 of row 5.\nMy coordinates (4,5) match this.\nSo I am interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nFinal check on the plan text.\n\"Plan: Move UP to get closer to the apples at (3,8) and (7,8). The enemy is closer to the bottom apples, so I will secure the top apples to avoid confrontation.\"\nThis is a good plan.\n\nI will format the output as:\n[Thoughts]\n[Plan]\nUP\n\n```text\nThinking:\nI am at (4,5).

This still leaves three viable follow\u2011up directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) next turn, preserving flexibility and avoiding a tight dead\u2011end.  \n- DOWN and LEFT do not provide an immediate apple and would reduce the number of safe options for the next turn (only two moves from DOWN, three from LEFT).  \n\nConsidering the need to both collect apples and keep future options open, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\n**Plan**  \nEat the apple at (5,1) to gain a point and grow, then reassess the board for the next move while maintaining multiple safe directions.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "I am at (4,7). The apple at (7,7) is directly to my right, distance 3.\nMy closest apple is (5,1), but there is an enemy snake at (4,1) (head) and (4,2) (body). Wait, the enemy snake head is at (4,1) and body at (4,2). That means the tail is at (4,2) and the body connects down to the head at (4,1)? No, the list is head-to-tail. So Head is (4,1), Body is [(4,2)]. This means the segment behind the head is (4,2). So the snake is pointing UP (from (4,2) to (4,1))? No, (4,1) to (4,2) is DOWN. Or (4,2) to (4,1) is UP. If Head is (4,1), the next segment is (4,2), which is DOWN from the head. So the tail is likely at (4,2) or further. The board shows '1' at (4,1) and 'T' at (4,2). Yes.\nThe apple at (5,1) is adjacent to my current position (4,7)? No, distance is large.\nWait, re-evaluating my coordinates from the board.\nBoard:\nRow 7: ` . . . . 0 . . A . . `\nI am at (4,7).\nApples listed: (5,1), (6,0), (7,8), (3,8), (7,7).\nWait, the board shows an apple at (7,7) in row 7? No, row 7 has 'A' at column 7? No, row 7 is ` . . . . 0 . . A . . ` (0 is my head at x=4). The 'A' is at column 7? No, indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\nRow 7: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n` . . . . 0 . . A . . `\n`0`=my head at (4,7).\n`A` at (7,7).\nSo (7,7) is an apple.\nRow 8: ` . . . A . . . A . . `\nApples at (3,8) and (7,8).\nRow 1: ` . . . . 1 A . . . . `\nApple at (5,1).\nRow 0: ` . . . . . . A . . . `\nApple at (6,0).\n\nI need to move. I am at (4,7).\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- UP to (4,8): Safe? Board row 8 shows ` . . . A . . . A . . `. At (4,8) it is empty. Enemy snake is at (4,1). Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Safe.\n\nStrategy: Eat the closest apples.\nClosest apples: (7,7) [dist 3], (3,8) [dist 4], (7,8) [dist 4].\nTo reach (7,7), I should move RIGHT.\nTo reach (3,8), I should move LEFT or UP.\nIf I go RIGHT, I go towards (7,7) and (7,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I go towards (3,8).\nIf I go UP, I go towards (3,8) and (7,8).\n\nThe enemy is at (4,1). They are far away. They might go for (5,1) or (6,0).\nI should focus on the top apples.\n\nLet's trace the path to (7,7).\n(4,7) -> (5,7) -> (6,7) -> (7,7).\nThis is 3 moves.\nPath to (3,8).\n(4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,8).\n(4,7) -> (4,8) -> (3,8).\n2 moves.\n\nThe distance to (3,8) is 2. To (7,7) is 3.\nSo (3,8) is closer.\nHowever, (3,8) and (7,8) are both at y=8.\nIf I go UP to (4,8), I can pivot to either.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,7), I can get (3,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,7), I can get (7,7) and (7,8).\n\nThe enemy cannot reach me. It is turn 2. The game just started.\nI should secure the apples on the top row.\nThe apples at (3,8) and (7,8) are far from the enemy.\nThe apples at (5,1) and (6,0) are close to the enemy.\nSo I should claim the top apples.\n\nDecision: I will move UP to (4,8).\nWhy? From (4,8), I can go LEFT to (3,8) or RIGHT to (7,8). This keeps my options open.\nIf I go LEFT now, I commit to (3,8). If I go RIGHT, I commit to (7,7).\nGoing UP allows me to choose the best path next turn based on enemy movement or new apple spawns.\nActually, I can reach (3,8) in 2 moves if I go LEFT now (-> 3,7 -> 3,8).\nIf I go UP now (-> 4,8), I reach (3,8) in 2 moves (-> 3,8).\nIf I go UP now, I can also reach (7,8) in 4 moves.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I can reach (7,7) in 3 moves.\nI want to eat the apples before they despawn (if they do, usually apples are static until eaten in Snake, but the prompt says \"Multi-apple Snake game\", implying static apples? It doesn't say they disappear or move. Usually they are static).\nWait, the prompt doesn't explicitly say apples disappear. But \"Multi-apple Snake game\" usually implies eating them removes them.\nIf apples are static, I can wait. But bigger score is better.\nIf I move UP, I am at (4,8).\nIf I move LEFT, I am at (3,7).\n(3,7) is closer to (3,8) (1 move).\n(4,8) is also 1 move from (3,8).\nHowever, (3,7) is closer to (3,8) by Manhattan distance? (3,7) is dist 1. (4,8) is dist 2? No. (4,8) to (3,8) is 1.\nSo both are fine.\nLet's check safety.\n(3,7): Is it safe? Board row 7 shows ` . . . . 0 . . A . . `. (3,7) is empty. Safe.\n(4,8): Board row 8 shows ` . . . A . . . A . . `. (4,8) is empty. Safe.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (5,1). It is far. I should not go for it yet. The enemy is closer.\nI should go for the top cluster.\nLet's go UP to (4,8). This allows me to get both top apples efficiently.\nIf I go UP, next turn I can go LEFT to (3,8) and eat apple.\nOr I can go RIGHT to (5,8) towards (7,8).\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 8 has apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\nRow 7 has apple at (7,7).\nIf I go UP to (4,8), I am between the two apples on row 8.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,7), I am under the left apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,7), I am under the right cluster.\nGoing UP seems most balanced.\n\nWait, if I go UP, I am at (4,8).\nNext turn, I can go LEFT to (3,8) [eat apple], then tail grows.\nOr I can go RIGHT to (5,8), then (6,8), then (7,8) [eat apple].\nThis seems good.\n\nLet's reconsider LEFT to (3,7).\nFrom (3,7), I go to (3,8) [eat apple].\nThen I can go UP? No, I'm at y=8 (top). I must go DOWN or RIGHT or LEFT.\nIf I eat (3,8), I am at (3,8).\nI can go DOWN to (3,7) (but my body might be there if I grew? No, I just ate, so my tail doesn't move until next turn).\nIf I eat (3,8), my length increases.\nThe previous head was (4,7), body (empty). After eating (3,8), body is [(4,7)].\nSo I can go DOWN to (4,7)? No, from (3,8) to (4,7) is diagonal.\nFrom (3,8), I can go DOWN to (3,7).\nBut (3,7) was where I came from? No, I moved (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,8).\nSo the body segments would be (3,7) then (4,7).\nSo I cannot go BACK to (3,7) immediately (that would be moving into my body? No, (3,7) is the second segment. Moving back to (3,7) from (3,8) is moving into the body).\nSo from (3,8), I must go LEFT (if valid) or RIGHT (into my body? No, body is at (3,7) and (4,7). Right is (4,8). That is valid.\nSo after eating (3,8), I can go RIGHT to (4,8).\nThen from (4,8), I can go RIGHT to (5,8) towards (7,8).\nThis path works.\n\nLet's check the UP move (4,7) -> (4,8).\nFrom (4,8), I can go LEFT to (3,8) [eat].\nThen body is (4,8), (4,7).\nFrom (3,8), I can go RIGHT to (4,8) (blocked by my body). I must go DOWN to (3,7).\nThis is also fine.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT are valid paths to the top apples.\nHowever, the apples are at (3,8) and (7,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I am closer to (3,8) but further from (7,8).\nIf I go UP, I am equidistant to both? No, from (4,8), distance to (3,8) is 1, to (7,8) is 3.\nFrom (3,7), distance to (3,8) is 1, to (7,8) is 5.\nSo UP is better for reaching the right cluster later.\nAlso, the apple at (7,7) is at y=7. If I go UP, I might miss (7,7) if I go for (7,8). But (7,7) is adjacent to (7,8).\nIf I go UP to (4,8), then RIGHT to (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). I pass (7,7) at y=7? No, I stay at y=8.\nTo get (7,7), I would need to go DOWN from (7,8) to (7,7).\nSo getting (7,8) allows me to get (7,7) easily.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,7), I get (3,8). Then I can go DOWN to (3,7), RIGHT to (4,7)... and chase (7,7)?\nThis is longer.\n\nSo UP is the best move to secure the top row apples.\n\nOne check: Enemy snake #1 is at (4,1).\nThey are very far. They will likely go for (5,1) or (6,0).\nI don't need to worry about them interfering with the top apples.\n\nSo, I will move UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (4,8) to position myself between the apples at (3,8) and (7,8).\n\nUP",

This keeps options open to secure the cluster on the top row, which is far from the enemy snake. Avoid the bottom area where the enemy is active.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nCurrent position: (4, 8)\nEnemy snake: Far away at (4, 1). Not an immediate threat.\nApples:\n- (3, 8): Top row, left. Distance 1 (LEFT). Requires moving to (3,8).\n- (7, 8): Top row, right. Distance 3 (RIGHT x3).\n- (7, 7): Below (7, 8). Distance 3 (RIGHT x1, DOWN x2 from (7,8) or RIGHT x2, DOWN x1 from (6,7)).\n- (5, 1) & (6, 0): Bottom row, near enemy. Risky/Long distance.\n\nAnalysis:\nMoving UP to (4, 9) is forbidden (off board).\nMoving DOWN to (4, 7) returns to the previous position. While physically safe (assuming no body segment there yet? No, the tail is at (4,7) at the start of the turn? No, the body is empty. But moving back is generally bad strategy).\nMoving LEFT to (3, 8) gets an apple immediately.\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 8) moves towards the right cluster.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat the top apples. From (4, 8), I can go LEFT to eat the apple at (3, 8) immediately. However, this commits me to the left side. If I go UP... I cannot go UP (y=9 is max).\nWait, the board size is 10x10, so y ranges 0 to 9. I am at (4,8). y=9 is the top.\nI cannot go UP because I am at y=8 and UP takes me to y=9? No, wait.\nY coordinates: 0 (bottom) to 9 (top).\nI am at (4,8).\nUP increases y to 9.\nIs (4,9) valid? Yes, y=9 is within 0-9.\nLet's re-read the board.\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 8: `. . . A 0 . . A . .`\nSo (4,9) is empty.\nSo I CAN go UP.\nWhy did I think I couldn't? Because y=8 is the second to last row? No, 10 rows means 0-9. 9 is the top.\nSo (4,9) is a valid coordinate.\nMoving UP to (4,9) puts me at the top edge.\nFrom (4,9), I can go LEFT to (3,9) -> (3,8) [eat apple].\nOr RIGHT to (5,9) -> (6,9) -> (7,9) -> (7,8) [eat apple].\nHowever, staying on the top row (y=9) limits my vertical movement. I can only go DOWN from there.\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I can go LEFT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8) [eat apple].\nOr I can go RIGHT to (5,9), then DOWN to (5,8), then RIGHT...\nThe apple at (3,8) is right there.\nThe apple at (7,8) is far.\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I am \"above\" the apples. I have to come DOWN to get them.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I eat an apple and I am at y=8.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I move towards the right cluster.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I am wasting a turn.\n\nLet's reconsider the UP move.\nIf I go UP to (4,9):\n1. I am at (4,9).\n2. I can then go LEFT to (3,9), then DOWN to (3,8) [Eat].\n3. Or I can go RIGHT to (5,9), then DOWN to (5,8), then RIGHT...\nThis path is longer to get the apples than simply moving LEFT or RIGHT now.\n\nWait, let's look at my \"Last Move Rationale\" again.\nI was at (4,7) (Turn 2).\nI moved UP to (4,8) (Turn 3).\nNow I am at (4,8) (Start of Turn 4).\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 3 / 150\".\nWait, if \"Turn: 3\" is displayed, and I am making a move, I am making the move for Turn 3.\nThe \"Start Last Move Pick\" shows UP.\nThis means I made the move UP on Turn 2 to get to the state in Turn 3?\nOr \"Turn: 3\" is the current turn index?\nUsually turn 1 is the first move.\nIf the game started, and it's my turn to move for \"Turn 3\", then the state shown is the state *after* Turn 2 moves?\nLet's assume \"Turn: 3\" means I am making the 3rd move.\nPrevious moves: Turn 1 (Start), Turn 2 (My move 1), Turn 3 (My move 2, currently deciding).\nThe prompt says \"Your last move information\" -> \"UP\".\nThis implies I just moved UP.\nSo previous state: (4,7).\nI moved UP.\nNew state: (4,8).\nSo the board shown is correct for my current position (4,8).\n\nNow, at (4,8), I need to choose the next move (Turn 3 move, or Turn 4 move? Let's stick to \"Turn: 3\").\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 3 / 150\".\nI will treat this as the move for Turn 3.\n\nCurrent position: (4, 8).\nApples: (3,8), (7,8), (7,7), (5,1), (6,0).\nDistance to (3,8): 1 (LEFT).\nDistance to (7,8): 3 (RIGHT x3).\nDistance to (7,7): 3 (RIGHT x2, DOWN x1).\nDistance to (5,1): Large.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (3,8).\n- Eat apple immediately. Score +1.\n- New position (3,8).\n- Next turn, I am at (3,8). I can move DOWN (to (3,7)), RIGHT (to (4,8)), or LEFT (to (2,8)).\n- This is a good immediate gain.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (5,8).\n- Move towards (7,8) and (7,7).\n- No apple eaten this turn.\n- New position (5,8).\n- Next turn, I can continue RIGHT to (6,8), then (7,8).\n- This delays the first apple but secures a path to the right cluster.\n\nOption 3: Move UP to (4,9).\n- No apple. Top edge. Limits movement to DOWN next turn.\n- Not optimal.\n\nOption 4: Move DOWN to (4,7).\n- No apple. Back to where I was. Bad.\n\nComparing Option 1 and 2:\nOption 1 guarantees an apple this turn.\nOption 2 doesn't.\nHowever, I am playing against Snake #1 who has 2 apples. I need to catch up.\nGetting an apple immediately is good.\nIs (3,8) safe?\nBoard shows `. . . A 0 . . A . .` at row 8.\n`(3,8)` is `A`. It's an apple.\nAre there any obstacles?\nEnemy snake is at (5,1). Safe.\nMy body is empty.\nSo LEFT is safe and gets an apple.\n\nIs there any reason not to take the apple at (3,8)?\nIf I take (3,8), I grow. My tail stays at (4,7) (or extends).\nNext turn, from (3,8), I am at the left side of the top cluster.\nI can then go DOWN to (3,7) or RIGHT to (4,8) (blocked by my tail if I just grew? No, tail is at (4,7). I am at (3,8). (4,8) is empty).\nActually, if I eat (3,8), my length becomes 1? No, I was length 1. Eating makes me length 2. The tail stays where the head was? No.\nIn Snake, if you eat, you grow. The tail does *not* move that turn.\nHead: (4,8) -> (3,8).\nBody: None -> (4,8) (previous head).\nTail: stays at (4,7) (the position before the move).\nWait, the prompt says \"Body: none\". So length 1.\nIf I move to (3,8) and eat, I grow.\nNew state: Head (3,8), Body [(4,8)], Tail (4,8) is the end of the body.\nWait, \"Body\" list in the prompt is usually empty for length 1.\nFor length 2: Head, Body, Tail? No, the list is Head-to-Tail.\nLength 1: [Head].\nLength 2: [Head, Tail].\nLength 3: [Head, Body, Tail].\n\nSo if I eat (3,8):\nHead moves to (3,8).\nPrevious head (4,8) becomes the body/tail.\nSo I will be at (3,8) with body (4,8).\nFrom (3,8), I can move DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8), or RIGHT to (4,8).\nMoving RIGHT to (4,8) would be moving into my own body (if body is at 4,8). Yes.\nSo from (3,8), I cannot go RIGHT immediately next turn.\nI must go DOWN or LEFT.\nGoing DOWN to (3,7) allows me to access the lower areas.\nGoing LEFT to (2,8) is towards the wall.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,8) now, I might lose it?\nThe enemy is at (5,1). They cannot reach (3,8) in 1 turn (distance is ~9).\nSo the apple is safe for next turn.\nHowever, why wait?\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I am setting up for (7,8).\nDistance to (7,8) from (5,8) is 2.\nDistance to (3,8) from (5,8) is 4.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I commit to the right cluster.\nIf I go LEFT now, I commit to the left apple.\n\nIs there an advantage to going RIGHT?\nThe right cluster has 2 apples: (7,8) and (7,7).\nThe left cluster has 1 apple: (3,8).\nAlso (6,0) and (5,1) are on the bottom right.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can eat (7,8) and (7,7), then eventually drop down to the bottom right for the other apples.\nIf I go LEFT, I eat (3,8), then I have to traverse the whole board to get to the right side.\nThe enemy is at the bottom right.\nIf I stay on the left/top, I am safe from the enemy.\nIf I go to the right, I might encounter the enemy later.\n\nHowever, the enemy is at (5,1). They are low.\nI am at (4,8). High.\nI can secure the top right apples easily.\n(7,8) and (7,7) are close to each other.\n(6,0) is also on the right.\nSo the right side is rich.\nThe left side only has (3,8).\nSo I should prioritize the right side?\nBut (3,8) is *right there*.\nIf I ignore (3,8) and go RIGHT, I can come back for (3,8) later?\nFrom (5,8) to (3,8) is distance 2.\nFrom (7,8) to (3,8) is distance 4.\nIt's not that far.\nBut if I go RIGHT now, I am not eating this turn.\nIf I go LEFT now, I eat this turn.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nSnake #1: Head (5,1). Body [(4,1), (4,2)].\nApples near enemy: (5,1) is an apple? No, apple is at (5,1) from list.\nWait, \"Apples at: ... (5,1)\".\nSnake #1 Head is at (5,1).\nDoes this mean Snake #1 is sitting on an apple?\nThe board shows ` . . . . 1 A . . . . ` at row 1.\n`1` is at (4,1). `A` is at (5,1).\nSo the apple is at (5,1).\nThe head is at (4,1)? No, \"Head: (5,1)\" in the text.\n\"Snake #1 - Head: (5,1), Body: [(4,1), (4,2)]\"\nBoard:\nRow 1: `. . . . 1 A . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n'1' is at index 4 -> (4,1).\n'A' is at index 5 -> (5,1).\nSo the board shows the head at (4,1) and the apple at (5,1).\nBut the text says Head is (5,1).\nThere is a contradiction between the text description and the board visual for Snake #1.\nVisual: '1' at (4,1).\nText: Head (5,1).\nUsually the board visual is the source of truth for current positions, but the text gives the apple count.\nIf the visual is correct, Snake #1 is at (4,1).\nIf the text is correct, Snake #1 is at (5,1).\nGiven the board shows '1' at (4,1), I should probably trust the visual map.\nHowever, if the text says Head (5,1), maybe the visual '1' is misleading or I miscounted.\nLet's check \"Snake #1 - Head: (5, 1), Body: [(4, 1), (4, 2)]\".\nIf Head is (5,1), then the body is (4,1) and (4,2).\nThe board shows 'T' at (4,2) and '1' at (4,1).\nSo '1' at (4,1) matches the first body part.\nThe Head (5,1) would be where 'A' is.\nSo the board map is likely not showing the enemy head numbers, or '1' is used for the body?\nWait, \"Snake #1... Board state: ... 1\".\nUsually '1' denotes the head.\nBut here, text says Head (5,1) and Body (4,1).\nVisual shows '1' at (4,1) and 'A' at (5,1).\nThis implies the visual map has the apple and the head overlapping?\nOr the visual map uses '1' for the body segment?\nLet's look at Row 2: `. A . . T . . . . .`\nApple at (1,2). 'T' at (4,2). Matches \"Body: [(4,1), (4,2)]\"?\nWait, Body is [(4,1), (4,2)].\nSo (4,2) is the tail. (4,1) is the segment before tail.\nHead is (5,1).\nSo the snake is shaped:\n(5,1) - Head\n(4,1) - Body\n(4,2) - Tail\nThis is a hook shape.\nVisual:\nRow 1: ... `1` at (4,1), `A` at (5,1). So '1' is the body part. 'A' is the apple.\nRow 2: ... `T` at (4,2).\nSo the visual uses '1' for the body part, not the head.\nThis is unusual but consistent with the text.\nSo the Head at (5,1) is overlapping the apple at (5,1) on the board? No, the board shows 'A' at (5,1).\nThis implies the apple is there, and the head is there.\nSnake heads can sit on apples.\nSo Snake #1 is at (5,1), sitting on the apple.\nThis means Snake #1 will likely eat that apple this turn.\nIf Snake #1 eats (5,1), it grows.\nSnake #1 is not a threat to me right now.\n\nBack to my move.\nI am at (4,8).\nI can move LEFT to (3,8) and eat an apple.\nI can move RIGHT to (5,8) and move towards the right cluster.\nThe right cluster has 2 apples. The left has 1.\nIf I go LEFT, I get 1 point now.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get 0 points now, but I am in position for 2 points later.\nHowever, if I go LEFT, I am at (3,8). From there I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (blocked).\nFrom (3,8), I can go DOWN to (3,7), then RIGHT all the way to the right.\nIt takes ~5 moves to cross the board.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am at (5,8). From there to (7,8) is 2 moves.\nFrom (7,8) to (7,7) is 1 move.\nSo I can get 2 apples in ~3 turns if I go RIGHT now.\nIf I go LEFT now, I get 1 apple now. Then I have to travel to the right.\nGoing RIGHT now seems better for apple density.\n\nBUT, (3,8) is right there.\nIf I don't take it, will it disappear? The rules don't say apples respawn or disappear unless eaten.\nIf apples are static, I can leave (3,8) for later.\nHowever, eating an apple now increases my length, which is generally good (survival) and score.\nBut score is the win condition.\nIf I can get 2 apples in the right cluster quickly, maybe I should prioritize that.\nLet's calculate paths.\nPath A (Left First):\nMove LEFT (Eat 1). (3,8).\nMove DOWN (3,7).\nMove RIGHT... (4,7)... (5,7)...\nMove RIGHT to (7,7) (Eat 2). (Eat 3? No, only (7,7) is at y=7).\nWait, right cluster: (7,8) and (7,7).\nFrom (3,8) to (7,8) is 4 moves.\nFrom (3,8) to (7,7) is 5 moves.\nSo getting both takes ~6 moves from (3,8).\nTotal moves: 1 (to 3,8) + 5 (to 7,7) = 6 moves. 1 apple so far? No, 1 apple at turn 1. 2nd apple at turn 6.\n\nPath B (Right First):\nMove RIGHT (0 apples). (5,8).\nMove RIGHT (0 apples). (6,8).\nMove RIGHT (Eat 1 at 7,8). (7,8).\nMove DOWN (Eat 2 at 7,7). (7,7).\nTotal moves: 3 to 2nd apple.\nSo B gets 2 apples in 3 moves (0, 0, 1, 2).\nA gets 1 apple in 1 move, 2nd in 6 moves (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2).\n\nPath B is clearly better for apple accumulation.\nThe only cost is missing (3,8) initially.\nCan I come back for (3,8)?\nFrom (7,7), distance to (3,8) is:\n(7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,8). 5 moves.\nIf I follow Path B, I get 2 apples in 3 turns.\nIf I follow Path A, I get 1 apple in 1 turn, 2nd in 6 turns.\nI want to maximize apples.\nThe enemy has 2 apples. I have 0.\nI need to catch up quickly.\nPath B allows me to get 2 apples quickly.\nPath A allows me to get 1 apple now, but delays the others.\nAlso, (3,8) is not contested.\nSo I should go RIGHT.\n\nIs there a trap?\nMoving RIGHT to (5,8).\nIs it safe?\nBoard row 8: `. . . A . . . A . .`\n(5,8) is empty (`. `).\n(6,8) is empty.\n(7,8) is `A`.\nSo the path is clear.\nEnemy is far.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT to position myself for the high-density apple cluster on the right/top. I will sacrifice the immediate (3,8) apple to get a better rate of return on the (7,8) and (7,7) apples.\n\nOne edge case: If apples disappear after eating, I must eat (3,8) now or lose it.\nThe prompt says \"Multi-apple Snake game\". Usually, apples persist until eaten. There is no mention of \"every X turns apples disappear\" or \"apples despawn\".\nSo I will assume apples stay.\nTherefore, I can leave (3,8) for later.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTurn 3: Move RIGHT to (5,8). This positions me to eat the apples at (7,8) and (7,7) in the next few turns. This cluster is worth 2 points and is safer than the bottom apples contested by the enemy.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

(6, 1)\n\n2.  **Safety & Immediate Threats:**\n    *   **Snake #1 (Enemy):** Located at (6, 0), far away (8 units). It poses no immediate threat to my head or potential moves near (6, 8).\n    *   **Board Boundaries:** I am at x=6, y=8. Moving UP goes to y=9 (safe). Moving DOWN goes to y=7 (safe). Moving LEFT goes to x=5 (safe). Moving RIGHT goes to x=7 (safe).\n    *   **Body Collisions:** I have no body segments, so I cannot collide with myself.\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (6, 9):** Moves to the top row. This limits future upward movement. It doesn't collect an apple immediately. It's safe but not optimal.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. Puts me closer to the apple at (7, 7). However, (6, 7) is currently empty (board shows A at 7,7, but 6,7 is empty).\n    *   **LEFT (5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward the apple at (3, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. There is an apple at (7, 8). This move allows me to eat immediately (growing to length 2) and sets me up to potentially eat at (7, 7) or (9, 8) next.\n\n4.  **Strategy & Apple Collection:**\n    *   There is a high density of apples in the x=7, y=7-8 area. Specifically, (7, 8) and (7, 7) are only 1 unit apart vertically.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 8) scores a point immediately.\n    *   From (7, 8), I can go DOWN to (7, 7) to score another point immediately on the next turn.\n    *   The apple at (3, 8) is far to the left. I can still reach it after eating the cluster on the right, or I might beat the enemy snake (who is at (6, 0)) to it, as he has to traverse the bottom length.\n    *   Eating (7, 8) and (7, 7) quickly gives me 2 points in 2 turns. This is very efficient. Since Snake #1 has 3 apples, I need to catch up. Securing quick points is vital.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT secures an apple immediately.\n    *   It maintains the option to get the second apple at (7, 7) next turn.\n    *   It keeps options open to loop back left towards (3, 8) later.\n    *   The enemy is too far away to interfere with this plan.\n\nMy plan is to eat the apple at (7,8) immediately. From there, I will likely move DOWN to eat the apple at (7,7), giving me 2 points quickly to catch up to Snake #1.\n\nRIGHT",

This reduces future flexibility.\n\nRIGHT moves the head to (7,0). The resulting body occupies (6,0), (6,1) and (5,1), leaving the cell (7,1) open above the head. This opens a clear path upward toward the apples at (7,7) and (7,8), aligns the snake with the column of several apples, and keeps multiple safe directions for the next turn.

Hits my own body (the segment that was the head last turn).\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation & Strategy:**\n    *   **Last Turn Rationale:** The previous turn's plan was to go LEFT. I am now at (6, 7).\n    *   **Right (7, 7):** Eliminated. Hits self.\n    *   **Up (6, 8):** This puts me directly next to the apple at (3, 8) and (2, 8)? No, that's far away. Actually, (6, 8) is on the same Y-level as the apple cluster at x=2 and x=3. It also sets up a path to the apple at (5, 2) via DOWN. However, looking at the board state, (6, 8) is in the top row area. It moves me towards the top apples.\n    *   **Down (6, 6):** This moves me toward the bottom apples (5, 2), (1, 2). It's a safe move but doesn't immediately gain ground on the closer apples (though the closest apples are actually at x=8, y=0 for Snake 1, but those are contested). The apples at (3, 8) and (2, 8) are 3-4 steps away.\n    *   **Left (5, 7):** This moves me towards the apple at (5, 2) and the top-left apples.\n\n    *   **Comparison:** UP and LEFT are both strong contenders.\n        *   **UP** brings me to (6, 8). From there, I can see the top apples clearly. I can then go LEFT to (5, 8), (4, 8), etc., or DOWN.\n        *   **LEFT** brings me to (5, 7). From there, I can go UP to (5, 8) or DOWN.\n\n    *   Let's look at the specific apple locations again: (3, 8), (2, 8), (5, 2), (1, 2), (8, 0).\n    *   (5, 2) is the closest vertically if I go DOWN now, but it's blocked by Snake 1's tail/body at (6, 0) and (7, 0). I can't go straight down to it easily. I have to go Left first.\n    *   The (3, 8) and (2, 8) cluster is accessible via UP or LEFT.\n    *   If I go UP to (6, 8), I am on the same row as the top apples (y=8). This is a good pivot. I can then move LEFT towards them.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (5, 7), I am one step further from the top row.\n    *   However, looking at the board state `7 . . . . . . 0 T . .`, my body is at (7, 7) and (7, 8). If I go UP to (6, 8), I am moving \"into\" the space near my tail. Is it safe? Yes, (6, 8) is empty.\n    *   Actually, wait. If I go UP, my head is at (6, 8). My body is (7, 7), (7, 8).\n    *   If I go LEFT, my head is at (5, 7). My body is (7, 7), (7, 8).\n    *   Both are safe.\n    *   Why choose UP? It gets me to the y=8 level where the apples (3,8) and (2,8) reside. It also keeps me out of the \"dead zone\" near the bottom right where Snake 1 might be going (though Snake 1 is at the bottom). The bottom apples (5,2) are close to Snake 1.\n    *   Strategy: Pursue the top-left apples. They are safer as they are away from Snake 1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Right is blocked by my body.\n    *   Down moves away from the top apples.\n    *   Left is good, but Up gets me to the target row (y=8) immediately.\n    *   Moving UP to (6, 8) is the best move to align with the apple cluster at (3, 8) and (2, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Align with the top row (y=8) to hunt the apples at (3, 8) and (2, 8).

This implies my head is at (3,8). However, the \"Turn: 12\" header and the map show my head at (4,8). The \"Last Move\" section explains I moved LEFT to (3,8) to eat the apple. To be consistent with the \"last move\" rationale and the board map (which shows the state *before* the move is executed in the simulation), I will assume the current turn allows me to move from (3,8).\n\n2.  **Board & Threats:**\n    *   **My Head (3, 8):**\n        *   **Left (2, 8):** Contains **Apple (A)**. Visually confirmed on row 8 of the map: `. . A A 0 ...` (where the second A is at x=2). This is the immediate goal.\n        *   **Right (4, 8):** Contains my **Body** (the segment that was previously at (3,8) or is currently at (4,8)). Moving Right is suicide.\n        *   **Up (3, 9):** Contains **Apple (A)** (visible on row 9: `... A ...`). Also valid.\n        *   **Down (3, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **Snake #1:** Located at (9,2). It is far away (bottom right corner). It cannot intercept me for the apple at (2,8) or (3,9) this turn.\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **LEFT (to 2, 8):**\n        *   **Risk:** Low. Snake #1 is far.\n        *   **Reward:** High. Apple collected.\n        *   **Future:** After eating, my body length increases. I will have an open path to the left (x=1, x=0).\n    *   **UP (to 3, 9):**\n        *   **Risk:** Moderate. This is the top row. If I go UP, I am pinned against the wall. My options become strictly LEFT or DOWN. If I go LEFT to (2,9) next, I could get trapped between the wall and enemy snakes (though they are far). Moving UP to an apple is safe *now*, but strategically restrictive.\n        *   **Reward:** Apple collected.\n    *   **DOWN (to 3, 7):**\n        *   Safe, but moves away from the cluster of apples on rows 8 and 9. Not optimal.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 4, 8):**\n        *   **Deadly.** Body collision.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The move **LEFT** is the optimal choice. It grabs an apple at (2,8), maintains a position with more future mobility (staying on row 8 allows movement up/down/forward) compared to moving to the top wall, and avoids the lethal RIGHT move. The \"Last Rationale\" correctly identified the apple at (3,8), but the current board state (map) shows the apple at (2,8) is the one immediately to the left of the head position (3,8).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2,8) by moving LEFT. If successful, I will look to grab the apple at (1,2) or (5,2) if I can navigate down, or continue left to (1,8) if apples appear there. Keep an eye on Snake #1 in the bottom right.\n**END CURRENT RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The apple I intended to eat at (2, 8) appears to be gone or I am currently occupying it, but I did not grow (body length is consistent with the previous turn's tail being at (6, 8) if I didn't eat, or perhaps I did eat and the list provided is pre-growth).

It keeps me in the open.\n    *   **UP:** Moves to top wall (2, 9). This restricts movement to only Left/Down. Wall traps are dangerous. Avoid if possible.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves to (2, 7). This is a safe move that brings me closer to the lower apples and opens up more board space.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Into self. **DIE.**\n4.  **Conclusion:** I should move **LEFT** or **DOWN**. **LEFT** is chosen because I am tracking the apple at (1, 2) and (5, 2). Moving LEFT keeps me horizontal, allowing me to scan for those apples, whereas DOWN commits me immediately to the lower level without checking the horizontal row first. Also, moving Left keeps me away from the immediate center column which might get busy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNavigate to the lower apples at (1,2) or (5,2) by moving Left then Down.

However, the board state shows the head at (1, 8) already. This confirms I successfully moved to (1, 8).\n\nCurrent analysis:\n1.  **Position:** Head at (1, 8).\n2.  **Body:** My body occupies (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8).\n3.  **Apples:** There are apples at (1, 2), (5, 2), (4, 4), (3, 9), (9, 6).\n4.  **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (7, 2).\n\n**Checking moves from (1, 8):**\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** On the board (x=0 is valid). Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** My own body (specifically the segment immediately behind my previous head position). **Lethal.**\n*   **UP (1, 9):** On the board. Empty (looking at the row '9' in the board map, column 1 is empty). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** On the board. Empty. Safe.\n\nSo, **RIGHT** is a death move. **LEFT**, **UP**, and **DOWN** are alive.\n\n**Evaluating remaining moves:**\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** Moves me to the far left wall. This restricts future moves (only can go Down or Right). While safe for one turn, it risks trapping me if I need to maneuver. It doesn't get me closer to any visible apples immediately (apples are at y=2,4,6,9).\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Moves to the top row (y=9). There is an apple at (3, 9). However, this is risky. The top row (y=9) is a dead end for movement. If I go UP, I will likely have to come DOWN next turn, which might trap me if the tail hasn't moved out of the way, or if I face an enemy. Also, the apple at (3, 9) requires moving Right twice.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** Moves me towards the center of the board. This opens up the most paths (Left, Right, Down, or Up in future turns). It aligns me with the apples at y=2 and y=4.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy goal is to collect apples (currently 4, need 50 to win or outscore opponent). The opponent is far away at (7, 2). I should prioritize safe expansion and gathering the nearby apples.\nThe apples at (1, 2) and (5, 2) are the closest cluster.\nMoving **DOWN** towards y=7 keeps me flexible and allows me to navigate to the central area to pick up apples. It avoids the wall traps of Left and Up.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategically sound move to maintain flexibility and head towards the lower apples is DOWN.\n\nMy long-term plan is to navigate to the lower apples at (1,2) or (5,2) by moving into the center of the board and avoiding walls. I must avoid moving into my own body at (2, 8).\n\nDOWN",

The tail was at (4, 8), so the new tail is at (4, 8). The old body segment at (1, 8) is still present because the head moved to (1, 6), creating a gap. Wait, let's trace the body segments strictly.\n        *   Old Head: (1, 7)\n        *   Old Body: [(1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)]\n        *   New Head: (1, 6)\n        *   New Body: The segment that was at (1, 7) becomes the first body segment. The segment at (1, 8) moves to (2, 8)? No, that's not how snake movement works. The whole body shifts.\n        *   Correct Snake State (Head-to-Tail):\n            *   Head: (1, 6)\n            *   Segment 1: (1, 7) (Was the old head)\n            *   Segment 2: (1, 8) (Was the old segment 1)\n            *   Segment 3: (2, 8) (Was the old segment 2)\n            *   Segment 4: (3, 8) (Was the old segment 3)\n            *   Tail: (4, 8) (Was the old segment 4/tail)\n    *   So, the cells occupied by my snake are: (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1**:\n    *   Old Head: (6, 2). Assuming it continued moving towards apples or just moved in a valid direction, we must be cautious. However, I do not see a definitive move for it in the prompt. I must assume its body remains connected and the head moved to a valid adjacent square. Without its move, I must be very careful not to step where it might land.\n    *   However, usually, the prompt implies I only know my move.\n    *   Let's look at the specific board positions around my new head (1, 6):\n        *   **LEFT (0, 6)**: Empty. Safe from self.\n        *   **RIGHT (2, 6)**: Empty. Safe from self. *BUT* looking at the previous board, (2, 8) was occupied by me. Now (2, 8) is still occupied by me (shifted). (2, 7) is empty. (2, 6) is empty.\n        *   **UP (1, 7)**: Occupied by my own body (segment 1). **Lethal**.\n        *   **DOWN (1, 5)**: Empty. Safe from self.\n\n4.  **Opponent Considerations**:\n    *   Enemy is at (6, 2) with body at (7, 2)... (9, 1). They are far away (distance ~5). Head-on collision is unlikely unless they move aggressively towards my area, but I am at y=6 and they are at y=2.\n    *   I should focus on my own survival and pathing.\n\n5.  **Strategic Move**:\n    *   **UP**: Moves into my own body at (1, 7). Dead.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 6)**: Empty.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 6)**: Empty.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 5)**: Empty.\n\n    I need to get to apples. The apples are at (1, 2), (5, 2), (4, 4), (3, 9), (9, 6).\n    The closest are (1, 2) and (5, 2).\n    Currently at (1, 6).\n    To reach (1, 2), I must go DOWN 4 times.\n    To reach (5, 2), I must go DOWN to y=2, then RIGHT to x=5.\n\n    Let's evaluate the directions:\n    *   **DOWN (1, 5)**: This brings me closer to the apples at y=2. It also keeps me away from the wall (I'm at x=1, wall is at x=0). It keeps options open (Left, Right, Down). This seems optimal.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 6)**: This moves me away from the (1, 2) apple but closer to the (5, 2) apple cluster. However, looking at the board, the column x=2, y=8 is occupied by my body. If I go RIGHT to (2, 6), I am safe now. But if I continue moving Right or Up, I might encounter my own body which stretches from (1,8) to (4,8).\n    *   **LEFT (0, 6)**: Moves to the wall. Dead end.\n\n    **Conclusion**: The safest path to the nearest apples is DOWN. It aligns me with the vertical column of the apple at (1, 2). I am at (1, 6), the apple is at (1, 2). I can simply go DOWN 4 times (assuming the tail moves out of the way).\n\n    Wait, let's check the board again.\n    Row 6: ` . . . . . . . . . A`\n    My new head is at (1, 6).\n    Row 6 is empty except for an apple at (9, 6).\n    Row 5 is empty.\n    Row 4 has an apple at (4, 4).\n    Row 2 has apples at (1, 2) and (5, 2).\n\n    Moving DOWN seems correct.\n\n    However, I need to be careful of the enemy at (6, 2). If they move UP, they might go to (6, 3), etc. But they are far.\n\n    The most direct path to points is DOWN.\n\n    One risk check: If I go DOWN to (1, 5), is it safe?\n    Board row 5 is empty.\n    My body is at (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n    (1, 5) is empty. Safe.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 6):\n    Board row 6, col 2 is empty.\n    My body is at (2, 8).\n    (2, 6) is safe.\n    But (2, 6) is not on the direct path to the apple at (1, 2) or (5, 2) (I'd have to snake back).\n\n    I will go DOWN.\n\n    Plan: Move DOWN to approach the apple at (1, 2). I will need to turn LEFT at some point to reach (1, 2) if I overshoot, but I am at (1, 6) now. (1, 2) is 4 steps down. I will move DOWN repeatedly until I reach (1, 2).\n\nDOWN",

I must be careful of the enemy snake at (6, 2) if I head towards that area later, but for now, securing the vertical apple at (1, 2) is the priority.\n\n**Current Move Analysis:**\n1.  **My State:** Head at (1, 6). Body follows to (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n2.  **Target:** Apple at (1, 2) is 4 cells South of my current head. Moving DOWN puts me 3 cells away.\n3.  **Safety Check (DOWN to 1,5):**\n    *   **On Board:** Yes (y=5 is valid).\n    *   **Self Collision:** The cell (1, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   **Enemy Collision:** Enemy is at (6, 2), which is distant and separated by empty space.\n4.  **Comparison with other moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Moves to (1, 7), which is occupied by my own body segment (the one that was previously my head). **Lethal.**\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to (0, 6). Safe, but pinning myself against the wall at x=0.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 6). Safe, but moving away from the nearest apple (1,2).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDOWN is the only move that is safe, progresses towards the nearest apple, and maintains central positioning.\n\nDOWN",

My tail remains at (1, 2) for this turn.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP (Target: (1, 3)):**\n    *   (1, 3) is the second segment of my body.\n    *   *Result:* **DEAD** (Self-collision).\n\n2.  **DOWN (Target: (1, 1)):**\n    *   (1, 1) is within the board.\n    *   (1, 1) is currently empty (only my tail at (1, 2) blocks the move back to (1, 2), but I am moving forward).\n    *   *Result:* **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **LEFT (Target: (0, 2)):**\n    *   (0, 2) is within the board.\n    *   (0, 2) is currently empty.\n    *   *Result:* **SAFE**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (Target: (2, 2)):**\n    *   (2, 2) is within the board.\n    *   The board state shows \"T\" at (2, 2). This is the tail of Enemy Snake #1.\n    *   Enemy Snake #1 is currently at (5, 4). He will almost certainly move towards an apple (like (7, 3)).\n    *   If Enemy #1 moves, his tail (currently at (8, 2)) will move forward into (7, 2). This frees up the space at (2, 2) for his body to slide into *if* he were connected there, but he isn't.\n    *   Wait, looking closer at the enemy body: ...[(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   The \"T\" at (2, 2) and (3, 2) shown on the board must belong to Enemy #1, but the text body listing stops at (7, 2).\n    *   Let's assume the board visualization is accurate. If (2, 2) is occupied by Enemy #1's body (even if the text list is truncated), moving there is a collision.\n    *   However, looking at the enemy's listed body: ...[(4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   The board shows \"T T T T\" at (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2).\n    *   Enemy #1 is definitely at (4, 2) and (5, 2).\n    *   The \"T\" at (2, 2) implies a long snake or a visualization error. Given the enemy is at (5, 4), he is not directly threatening (2, 2) this turn.\n    *   However, moving to (2, 2) brings me closer to the enemy's path.\n    *   **RISK:** Moving RIGHT puts me on a path parallel to the enemy. If he turns UP or LEFT, we might collide in future turns.\n    *   **SAFETY:** This turn, (2, 2) is likely safe *if* it is just a tail that will disappear. But if it's a body part, it's unsafe.\n    *   Given the ambiguity and the risk of getting near the enemy, LEFT or DOWN is safer.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n\n*   **DOWN (1, 1):** Moves me towards the bottom-left corner. This is a dead end. I will have fewer escape routes in future turns.\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Moves me to the left edge. I can still move UP or DOWN from there. It puts a wall to my left, which restricts movement but also provides a boundary to maneuver against.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is strictly better than DOWN because it keeps me closer to the center (x=1 vs x=0 is negligible, but y=2 is better than y=1) and offers better long-term positioning to eventually target the apples at (7, 3) or (5, 7). Moving DOWN traps me in the corner too quickly.\n\n**Wait, let's re-read the prompt's \"T\" visualization.**\nThe board state is:\n`7 . T . . . A . . . .`\n`4 . T . . T 1 . . . .`\n`3 . T . . T . . A . .`\n`2 . 0 . . T T T T . .`\n\nThis confirms the enemy body occupies (4,2) and (5,2). The \"T\" at (2,2) and (3,2) are also likely part of the enemy's body (implied by the chain of T's).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,2), I am stepping onto the enemy's body (tail).\n**BUT**, the enemy is moving this turn.\nIf the enemy moves, his tail will vacate (8,2) and the body segments will shift.\nThe segment at (2,2) will shift to (3,2), leaving (2,2) empty *provided the enemy is moving forward*.\nHowever, stepping onto a tail is risky if the enemy doesn't move or moves in a way that keeps the body there (unlikely in Snake rules, tails always move if the head moves, unless the head eats).\nThe enemy head is at (5,4). He has plenty of space.\nIt is highly probable that (2,2) will be empty *after* the enemy moves.\nHowever, the prompt says \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\" This happens *simultaneously* with their movement.\nIf the enemy moves forward, his tail leaves (8,2). The body shifts. The cell that was (2,2) becomes (3,2). The cell (2,2) becomes empty.\nSo (2,2) is likely safe.\n\n**Let's look at the Apples again.**\n(7, 3) is a good target.\nTo get to (7, 3), I need to go East.\nGoing LEFT (0,2) takes me *away* from the apples.\nGoing DOWN (1,1) takes me *away* from the apples.\nGoing RIGHT (2,2) takes me *towards* the apples.\n\nIs (2,2) safe?\nThe enemy body (visualized as T's) is at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\nThe enemy head is at (5,4).\nIf the enemy moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, the tail moves.\nIf he moves UP (5,5): Tail moves to (3,2) -> (4,2) ... (8,2)? No, the tail is the last segment.\nLet's trace the enemy body: (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Wait, the text body is: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)].\nThis lists the body from head to tail.\nHead: (4, 4).\nTail: (7, 2).\nThe board shows \"T\" at (2,2) and (3,2). The text body stops at (7,2).\nThis implies the text list is missing some segments, or the board shows more tails than listed.\nAssuming the board is the source of truth: The snake occupies (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), and likely (2,2), (3,2)? That would be a gap.\nActually, look at the text: `Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]`\nThis is 6 body segments + 1 head = length 7.\nThe board shows 4 \"T\"s near the start of that chain (row 2).\nThis is confusing.\nLet's trust the *text description* of the body, as that is usually the precise data.\nIf the body is `[(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]`, then (2,2) and (3,2) are NOT occupied.\nThe board visualization might be simplified or showing \"T\" for tails in general, or specifically for *my* snake (which ends at 1,7) and *other* debris?\nNo, the prompt says \"T\" represents a tail.\nIn the specific context of Snake games, a \"T\" usually marks the tail of a snake.\nIf Enemy #1's tail is at (7, 2) (per text), then (2,2) is empty.\nHowever, I must be cautious. If I move RIGHT to (2,2), I am moving away from my own tail (which is at 1,2) and towards the center.\n(2,2) is empty.\nMoving RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Why is LEFT (0,2) bad?**\nIt moves me to the edge. I will eventually have to turn around or get trapped. I am effectively abandoning the central apples (7,3) to the enemy.\n\n**Why is DOWN (1,1) bad?**\nIt moves me towards the corner. I will be trapped.\n\n**Why is RIGHT (2,2) good?**\nIt moves me towards the apple at (7,3).\nIt keeps me on row 2, which is currently clear (based on text body list).\nThe enemy is at row 4. We are separated.\nI can dodge UP or DOWN if he approaches.\n\n**Why is UP (1,3) bad?**\nInto my own body.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move RIGHT to (2,2). This is the only move that progresses towards an apple.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nHead towards (7, 3) apple. Watch enemy #1 at (5, 4). If he moves East, be prepared to wait or dodge. If he moves West, I can claim (7, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

It is safe to move here.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 1)**: The cell (2, 1) is currently empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 2)**: The cell (1, 2) contains my own body segment. Moving here would cause immediate death.\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 2)**: The cell (3, 2) contains the body of Enemy #1 (marked as `T` on the board, part of the chain `...T T T T` starting from `2,2`).

They are not currently a threat to my immediate move to `(2, 3)`.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving UP is the only option that progresses towards the nearest available apple and maintains good board positioning.

It is safe to move here.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 2)**: The cell (2, 2) contains my own body segment (the one immediately following my current head). Moving here would cause immediate death (moving backwards).\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 3)**: The cell (1, 3) contains my own body segment. Moving here would cause immediate death.\n    *   **RIGHT to (3, 3)**: The cell (3, 3) contains `0` in the board view, which represents the rest of my snake. Specifically, looking at my body list `[(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`, (3, 3) is empty. Wait, looking at the board state:\n       `3 . T 0 . T . . A . .`\n       The `0` is at `(2, 3)`. The `.` is at `(3, 3)`. So (3, 3) is empty.\n       However, checking the board again:\n       `4 . T . . T T T 1 . .`\n       `3 . T 0 . T . . A . .`\n       `2 . T T . T T . . . .`\n       (3, 3) is the dot immediately to the right of `0`. It is safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Considerations**:\n    *   **Immediate Threats**: The body of Enemy #1 is marked as `T`. Looking at the board:\n        `4 . T . . T T T 1 . .`\n        `3 . T 0 . T . . A . .`\n        `2 . T T . T T . . . .`\n        The `T` at `(2, 4)` is part of Enemy #1's body (connected to `(2, 5)`, `(3, 5)`, etc., leading to head at `(7, 4)`? No, Enemy #1 is at `(7, 4)` with body `[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]`.\n        Wait, let's re-read the \"Board state\" carefully. The characters `0`, `1`, `T`, and `A` represent positions on the board.\n        My snake is `0` at `(2, 3)`.\n        Enemy #1 is `1` at `(7, 4)`.\n        The `T` marks are likely the body of Enemy #1 OR a trap/hazard. But the problem states \"Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]\".\n        Let's map the `T`s:\n        `(1, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(2, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(3, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(4, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(5, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(6, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(7, 5)` is `T`.\n        `(1, 4)` is `T`.\n        `(2, 4)` is `T`.\n        `(4, 4)` is `T`. (Wait, Enemy #1 body has `(4, 4)`. Matches).\n        `(1, 3)` is `T`. (My body has `(1, 3)`. Matches).\n        `(2, 3)` is `0`. (My head).\n        `(4, 3)` is `T`. (Enemy #1 body has `(4, 3)`. Matches).\n        `(1, 2)` is `T`. (My body has `(1, 2)`. Matches).\n        `(2, 2)` is `T`. (My body has `(2, 2)`. Matches).\n        `(3, 2)` is `T`.\n        `(4, 2)` is `T`. (Enemy #1 body has `(4, 2)`. Matches).\n        `(5, 2)` is `T`. (Enemy #1 body has `(5, 2)`. Matches).\n        \n        There is a discrepancy. The board shows `T`s at `(2,4)`, `(3,5)`, etc., which are NOT in the listed Enemy #1 body `[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]`.\n        However, the problem states \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\". The board is provided for visualization.\n        I must trust the board visualization for immediate collision avoidance.\n        \n        **Crucial Check for Move UP (2,4):**\n        Board at `(2, 4)` is `T`.\n        If `T` is an obstacle (snake body), I cannot move there.\n        \n        **Crucial Check for Move RIGHT (3,3):**\n        Board at `(3, 3)` is `.`.\n        This is empty. Safe.\n        \n        **Crucial Check for Move DOWN (2,2):**\n        Board at `(2, 2)` is `T`.\n        My body list says `(2, 2)` is part of my body.\n        So DOWN is suicide.\n        \n        **Crucial Check for Move LEFT (1,3):**\n        Board at `(1, 3)` is `T`.\n        My body list says `(1, 3)` is part of my body.\n        So LEFT is suicide.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating UP:**\n        If the board visualization is accurate, `T` at `(2,4)` is occupied. I cannot go UP.\n        \n    *   **Re-evaluating RIGHT:**\n        `(3, 3)` is `.`.\n        Is there any other snake there?\n        Enemy #1 is at `(7, 4)`. His body is listed as `[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]`.\n        None of those are `(3, 3)`.\n        So RIGHT is safe.\n        \n    *   **Wait, let's look at the board again.**\n        `3 . T 0 . T . . A . .`\n        The `.` is at index 3 (X=3). The `T` is at index 4 (X=4).\n        So `(3, 3)` is indeed empty.\n        \n        Is there any other move?\n        UP to `(2, 4)` -> `T`. Blocked.\n        DOWN to `(2, 2)` -> `T` (My body). Blocked.\n        LEFT to `(1, 3)` -> `T` (My body). Blocked.\n        RIGHT to `(3, 3)` -> `.`. Open.\n        \n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        Only RIGHT is safe. My previous move rationale (simulated history) was based on a slightly different board state or visualization interpretation, but according to the strict \"Board state\" provided in *this* turn, `(2, 4)` is occupied.\n        \n    *   **Strategy for RIGHT:**\n        Moving to `(3, 3)` opens up paths to the apple at `(7, 3)`.\n        I am at `(2, 3)`. Moving Right to `(3, 3)` puts me on `y=3`.\n        The apple at `(7, 3)` is on `y=3`.\n        This seems like a good path.\n        \n        I must also check if Enemy #1 might hit me. He is at `(7, 4)`.\n        He might move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n        If he moves DOWN, he hits `(7, 3)` (an apple). He would grow.\n        If he moves LEFT, he hits `(6, 4)` (his own body).\n        If he moves UP or RIGHT, he stays away from me.\n        Since I am at `(3, 3)`, I am far away. Head-on collision is unlikely this turn.\n\n    *   **Final Check on Rules:**\n        \"If you move onto an apple, you grow...\" - `(3, 3)` is empty.\n        \"If you move outside the board...\" - `(3, 3)` is inside.\n        \"If your head moves into any snake's body...\" - `(3, 3)` is empty.\n        \"Moving directly backwards...\" - I am at `(2, 3)`. Right is not backwards.\n\n    *   **Final Decision:**\n        UP is blocked by `T`.\n        DOWN is blocked by `T` (my body).\n        LEFT is blocked by `T` (my body).\n        RIGHT is open.\n        I must go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to `(2, 3)`**: Occupied by **My Tail**. Safe (Tail moves away next turn).\n    *   **RIGHT to `(4, 3)`**: Occupied by **Enemy #1's Body**. Unsafe (Death).\n\n    *Self-Correction on Logic:* Moving into an enemy body is death. Enemy #1's body is listed as `[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]`.

It moves me towards the cluster of apples at `(5, 7)` and `(8, 6)`. It also creates distance from the low-health Enemy #1.\n    *   **DOWN** is safe (Apple). However, looking at the board, Enemy #1 is currently at `(7, 3)`. If I go DOWN, I end up at `(3, 2)`. If Enemy #1 goes DOWN, they are at `(7, 2)`. No conflict there.\n    *   However, eating the apple at `(3, 2)` requires me to squeeze between my own body at `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)` on subsequent turns to leave the area. It is a \"blind corner\".\n    *   Going **UP** to `(3, 4)` is cleaner. It keeps me on the board, avoids the apple at `(3, 2)` which is currently a bit tricky to access safely without trapping myself, and positions me to route towards `(5, 7)` or `(9, 6)`.\n    *   Given Enemy #1 cannot move UP or LEFT, there is zero risk of a head-on collision with them in the `(3, 4)` or `(4, 4)` area this turn. They are forced to move away.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will move **UP**. It is safe, avoids the immediate conflict zone (Enemy #1's potential path), and keeps options open for the larger apples.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 3)**: My own body (neck). **Unsafe**.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 4)**: Open space. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 4)**: Enemy body (part of the line extending from `... (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> ...`). **Unsafe**.\n\n4.  **Strategy**:\n    *   I must avoid UP and RIGHT.\n    *   My previous move was UP. I cannot move DOWN because that is effectively reversing into my neck (where my body currently is).\n    *   Therefore, the only safe move is **LEFT**.\n    *   Moving LEFT to `(2, 4)` keeps me alive and moves me away from the enemy's current location.\n\nDecision: I must move LEFT to survive.\n\nLEFT",

More importantly, moving **RIGHT** maintains a more central position on the board, keeping options open for subsequent turns. Moving UP locks me into the left side of the board.

However, my body is currently at (2, 7) and (3, 4). Moving UP to (3, 8) places my new head at (3, 8), and my new tail (after the move) will be the segment currently at (2, 7).\n    *   **Immediate Threat:** Enemy snake #1 has its head at (9, 7). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n        *   If it moves LEFT, it goes to (8, 7).\n        *   If it moves UP, it goes to (9, 8).\n        *   If it moves DOWN, it goes to (9, 6).\n        *   If it moves RIGHT, it goes to (10, 7) and dies.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Enemy #1 is currently at distance 6 on the X-axis. It is unlikely to reach (3, 8) in one turn. This move seems mechanically safe (not hitting a wall or my own body immediately).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board shows a dot `.` at (3, 6).\n    *   **Body Check:** My body occupies (2, 6), (2, 5), etc. (3, 6) is clear.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** There is an apple at (3, 2), which is 4 units DOWN. This direction aligns with that apple. However, the apple at (5, 7) is just 2 units RIGHT.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** My body is currently at (2, 7). Moving here is suicide. **DEADLY**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board shows a dot `.` at (4, 7).\n    *   **Body Check:** My body occupies (3, 4), (2, 7), etc. (4, 7) is clear.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves directly toward the apple at (5, 7). This is a high-value target.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\nI want to prioritize the apple at (5, 7) as it is the closest (distance 2). To get there, I need to move RIGHT twice. From (3, 7), moving RIGHT to (4, 7) is the first step.\nComparing UP to (3, 8) and RIGHT to (4, 7):\n*   RIGHT moves me directly to (5, 7), securing a point quickly.\n*   UP moves me toward (3, 9), which is further away (distance 2, then 2).\n*   I must also consider the enemy. The enemy is at (9, 7). If I move RIGHT to (4, 7), and the enemy moves LEFT, we are getting closer. However, the board is large (10x10), and the enemy has a long tail to manage.\n*   If I move UP, I go to (3, 8). The apple at (5, 7) is at (5, 7), which is X=5, Y=7. If I am at (3, 8), the distance to (5, 7) is 2 X and 1 Y = 3 moves. If I move RIGHT to (4, 7), the distance to (5, 7) is 1 move.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT to (4, 7) sets me up to eat the apple at (5, 7) next turn. This is the most efficient move to gain a point.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (4, 7). Next turn, move RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat the apple. Watch enemy #1's movement; if they aggressively close the distance, I may need to pivot UP or DOWN later, but currently, the RIGHT path seems open.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy is far.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves toward the apple at (3, 2).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Board Check:** The board shows `A` at (5, 7).\n    *   **Apple Check:** There is an apple at (5, 7).\n    *   **Safety Check:** My body is at (3, 7), (2, 7), etc. (5, 7) is clear.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** I eat an apple, grow, and gain a point.\n    *   **Result: SAFE, HIGH VALUE (Apple).**\n\n**Comparison:**\nI have two moves that result in eating an apple: **UP (to 4, 8)** and **RIGHT (to 5, 7)**. Both are immediately safe.\n\n*   **Scenario A (Moving UP to 4, 8):**\n    *   Head: (4, 8). Neck: (4, 7).\n    *   Next turn, potential moves: (3, 8), (5, 8), (4, 9), (4, 7).\n    *   (4, 7) is blocked by neck.\n    *   (3, 9) is a nearby apple (distance 2).\n    *   (5, 7) is the apple I just considered (distance 2).\n\n*   **Scenario B (Moving RIGHT to 5, 7):**\n    *   Head: (5, 7). Neck: (4, 7).\n    *   Next turn, potential moves: (4, 7), (6, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8).\n    *   (4, 7) is blocked by neck.\n    *   (6, 7) leads toward empty space (and enemy territory).\n    *   (5, 8) is open (though board shows empty there, (4, 8) apple is gone if I go UP).\n    *   (5, 6) is open.\n\n**Strategic Conclusion:**\nBoth moves offer an immediate point. However, moving **RIGHT** to (5, 7) leaves my head at X=5, Y=7. This position is adjacent to the open area at Y=8 and the open area at Y=6. My tail will be at (4, 7). This leaves me with good flexibility. Moving **UP** to (4, 8) might constrain me slightly if I want to immediately go for (3, 9) or loop back.\n\nMore importantly, I should consider the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at (8, 7). If I stay at X=4/5 area, I am in the middle. If I move RIGHT to (5, 7), I am progressing across the board. If I move UP, I am staying at X=4.\n\nBoth are valid. Let's look at the tail clearance. In both cases, the segment (3, 7) becomes the neck, and (2, 7) becomes the second body segment. Since I am eating an apple, my tail does *not* move forward (I grow). So the space behind my neck clears up.\n\nLet's stick to the plan established in the previous turn's rationale: \"Next turn, move RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat the apple.\" Since this move is safe and fulfills the plan to eat the closest apple, I will execute it.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (5, 7) to eat the apple. This grows my length to 7 and puts me in a flexible position for the next turn, likely aiming for (4, 8) or (5, 8) or clearing space.\nRIGHT",

However, I need to check the board carefully.\n    ```\n     9 . . . A . . . . . .\n    ```\n    At y=9, x=5 is `.` (empty). Wait, let me re-read the map.\n    ```\n     9 . . .

It eats an apple (+1 score).\n2.  It grows my snake (making me safer from tail cutting later).\n3.  It positions me to attack the apple at (3, 9) next turn (by moving UP).\n4.  It avoids the enemy at (7, 8).\n\nThe enemy is at (7, 8). They are not an immediate threat to me moving left to (4, 8).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 8) to eat the apple.

Not a threat.\n\n*   **Comparison:** Both moves position me to eat the apple at (3, 9) next turn.\n    *   If I go UP to (4, 9), I am at the top wall. This reduces my future movement options (can't go UP anymore).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (3, 8), I am not at the wall. I can still move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. This keeps options more open.\n    *   Also, looking at the board, moving UP puts me at y=9, which is the top boundary. Staying at y=8 (or lower) is generally safer and more flexible. For example, from (3, 8) I might eventually want to go DOWN towards the apple at (3, 2) or (7, 3). If I go UP to (4, 9), I have to come back DOWN immediately, potentially trapping myself if the enemy moves close (though unlikely).\n    *   Therefore, **LEFT to (3, 8)** is the better move to keep options open and avoid the wall.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 8). From there, move UP to (3, 9) next turn to eat the apple. Watch out for the enemy at (8, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Eating the apple increases length and score.\n    *   Eating an apple is generally a high priority.\n    *   After eating, the tail will not move on the next turn, so we grow.\n    *   From (3, 9), we will be at the top wall (y=9). We cannot go UP next turn. We can go DOWN (back to 3,8), LEFT (to 2,9), or RIGHT (to 4,9). 2,9 is empty (top row is `. . . A . . . . . .`). 4,9 is empty. 3,8 will be occupied by our body (tail segment) unless we keep growing, but it will eventually be clear. It's a viable position.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (2, 8).**\n    *   This does not eat an apple.\n    *   From (2, 8), we can potentially go to (2, 9) or (3, 8) or DOWN.\n    *   We can still reach the apple at (3, 9) next turn by going RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT (if we were at 2,9). But going LEFT delays the apple acquisition.\n    *   The enemy is at (9, 8), far away. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is the optimal move. It secures an apple immediately. While it puts us against the wall, the wall is not immediately restrictive because there is open space to the left and right on the top row. Delaying the apple is unnecessary risk.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (3, 9) to eat the apple. On the next turn, assess moves from (3, 9) (likely LEFT to 2,9 or DOWN to 3,8) to continue maneuvering towards other apples like (3, 2) or (7, 3).\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

While safe, it might get crowded if I need to maneuver later.\n*   **DOWN:** Moving to (2, 6) is the most direct path towards the target apples. It maintains a straight line down the empty column 2, maximizing future movement options and efficiency.\n\nTherefore, **DOWN** is the optimal move to continue my descent safely.\n\nDOWN",

The tail is currently at (5, 8).\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 Head at (4, 9). Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]. The tail is at (8, 7).\n*   **Apples:** (3, 2), (8, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (9, 2). The closest apple is at (7, 5), followed by (3, 2).\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head at 2, 5):**\n\n*   **UP to (2, 6):**\n    *   Target: (2, 6).\n    *   Board Check: This is the neck of my snake.\n    *   **Result: DEADLY (Suicide).**\n\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n    *   Target: (2, 4).\n    *   Board Check: Row 4, column 2 is empty (`. . . . . . . . . .`).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n    *   Target: (1, 5).\n    *   Board Check: Row 5, column 1 is empty.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Target: (3, 5).\n    *   Board Check: Row 5, column 3 is empty.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n*   **DOWN** moves me further down column 2 towards the apples at y=2 and y=3. This keeps me in a relatively clear column.\n*   **LEFT** moves me to column 1, away from the central apples and my body.\n*   **RIGHT** moves me to column 3, towards the apple at (3, 2). However, column 3 is near my body (which runs from (3,9) down to (4,8) and (5,8)). Moving right might corner me later if I want to go down, as my body is at y=8 in columns 3, 4, and 5. (Correction: The body segment at (3, 9) and (3, 8) is directly above (3, 2), but far enough away not to be an immediate threat. However, the body at (4,8) and (5,8) blocks movement to the right at higher y-values).\n\nGiven the objective to move towards reachable apples while keeping options open:\n*   The apple at (7, 5) is very close (x+5, y+0). I cannot go right because (3,5), (4,5), etc., are empty, but I need to bypass the body at (3,8) and (4,8) to get to y=8? No, the apple is at y=5. I am at y=5. The apple at (7,5) is on the same row. My body occupies (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8). To get to (7,5), I need to go Right.\n    *   Wait, looking at the board state for Row 5: ` . . 0 . . . . A . . ` (Indices 0-9).\n    *   Row 5 has an 'A' at index 7. I am at index 2.\n    *   My body is at `(5,8)`, `(4,8)`, `(3,8)`. This is in row 8.\n    *   My body is at `(2,6)`.\n    *   So the path Right from (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) is CLEAR of my own body.\n    *   The only obstacle is the enemy. The enemy is at row 9 (Head at 4,9). They are far away.\n    *   So moving RIGHT to (3,5) is a direct path to an apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n*   **RIGHT** leads directly to the apple at (7,5) in 5 moves. This is a very strong move.\n*   **DOWN** leads to the apple at (3,2) or (7,3) eventually. This is more indirect.\n\nWhy did I choose DOWN in the previous turn?\n\"RIGHT moves me closer to my body cluster in columns 3-5... RIGHT is the best move to continue the descent safely.\" (Wait, my previous rationale said DOWN was best). Let's look at why I thought RIGHT was bad previously. My head was at (2,6). Right took me to (3,6). The body was at (3,9) and (3,8). That is safe. However, I am currently at (2,5).\nThe apple at (7,5) is a straight line. Moving RIGHT is the highest value move.\n\nLet's check the immediate safety of RIGHT (to 3,5) again:\n*   My body: `(2,6)` is the neck (UP is forbidden). `(2,7)...` is in column 2. `(3,9), (3,8)...` is in column 3, but at y=8 and y=9. `(4,8)...` is column 4. So (3,5) is empty.\n*   Enemy 1: Head at (4,9). Body at `(5,9)...` They are nowhere near (3,5).\n*   Apples: (7,5) is the target.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go Right?\nIf I go DOWN to (2,4), I am moving towards the apple at (3,2). The distance to (3,2) is |2-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), I am moving towards the apple at (7,5). The distance is |3-7| + |5-5| = 4 moves.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,5), distance to (3,2) is 2 + 3 = 5 moves.\n\nWait, there is an apple at (7,3). Distance from (3,5) to (7,3) is 4 + 2 = 6.\nDistance from (2,5) to (3,2) is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nHowever, the apple at (7,5) is right there on the same row. The path is clear.\nI should secure the nearest apple.\nThe nearest apple is at (7,5) (Manhattan distance 5).\nThe next nearest is (3,2) (Manhattan distance 3 from current position? Wait, |2-3| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4).\nWait, the apple at (7,5) is at x=7, y=5. My head is at x=2, y=5.\nDistance is 5.\nThe apple at (3,2) is at x=3, y=2.\nDistance is 4.\nThe apple at (3,2) is closer.\n\nLet's trace the path to (3,2) from (2,5).\n(2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\nThis path is clear. My body is at (2,6). So (2,4), (2,3) are safe.\n\nLet's trace the path to (7,5) from (2,5).\n(2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5).\nThis path is clear of my body (my body is at x=2 or y>=8).\n\nSo we have two good targets.\nTarget A: (3,2), distance 4, requires 2 DOWN moves then 1 RIGHT.\nTarget B: (7,5), distance 5, requires 5 RIGHT moves.\n\nTarget A is closer.\nIf I go DOWN now, I start the path to (3,2).\nIf I go RIGHT now, I start the path to (7,5).\n\nIs there any other factor?\nThe enemy is at (4,9). They are moving. If they move DOWN, they might threaten row 8, but I am moving down.\nIf I go DOWN, I stay in column 2. If I go RIGHT, I enter column 3.\nColumn 3 has my body at (3,8) and (3,9). If I go to (3,5), I am safe. But if I need to turn later, column 3 is a bit occupied by my own tail (high up).\nHowever, if I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy (who is at y=9).\nThe apple at (3,2) is safe to get.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5: ` . . 0 . . . . A . . `\nRow 4: ` . . . . . . . . . . `\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . A . . `\nRow 2: ` . . . A . . . . . A `\n\nGoing DOWN is safe.\nGoing RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am committed to the path (2,4), (2,3)...\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committed to (3,5), (4,5)...\n\nLet's check the apple at (8,1).\nDistance from (2,5): |2-8| + |5-1| = 6 + 4 = 10. Far.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"immediate\" gain.\nThe apple at (3,2) requires 4 moves.\nThe apple at (7,5) requires 5 moves.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I start that sequence.\nIf I go RIGHT, I start the other sequence.\n\nIs there any danger in going RIGHT?\nEnemy at (4,9). If they move LEFT, they go to (3,9). That's their body, so they can't do that. They can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nIf they go DOWN to (4,8), that is their body (Snake #1 body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]).\nWait, looking at Enemy body: (5,9) is the neck.\nThe body includes (4,9)? No, the head is (4,9). The body starts at (5,9).\nSo (4,9) is free of their own body.\nIf they go DOWN to (4,8), is (4,8) occupied by their body?\nBody list: (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7).\nNo, (4,8) is empty for them.\nSo they can move to (4,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), they go to (4,8). We are far apart.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,4), they might go DOWN to (4,8). Still far.\n\nWhat if I go RIGHT?\nI move to (3,5).\nThe enemy is at (4,9).\nThey might move DOWN. If they move DOWN twice in a row, they reach y=7. Still safe.\n\nWhat about the other apple? (7,5).\nIf I go RIGHT, I claim the path to (7,5). It's a straight line.\nIf I go DOWN, I claim the path to (3,2).\n\nWait, there is an apple at (7,3).\nFrom (3,5), distance to (7,3) is 4+2=6.\nFrom (2,4), distance to (7,3) is 5+1=6.\nFrom (2,5), distance to (7,3) is 5+2=7.\n\nIf I go DOWN now, I am at (2,4).\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am at (3,5).\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nThe enemy snake #1 is large (10 apples). They are probably hunting apples too.\nThere is an apple at (7,5).\nThere is an apple at (7,3).\nThere is an apple at (9,2).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I move towards the \"right side\" apples.\nIf I go DOWN, I stay central/left.\n\nLet's look at my tail movement.\nCurrent tail: (5,8). The body segment in front of it is (4,8).\nSo (4,8) will become the tail next turn, and (5,8) will disappear.\nWait, the body list is: `[(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]`.\nSo (2,6) is head relative? No, Head is (2,5). Wait, the user prompt says:\n\"Head: (2, 5)\"\n\"Body: [(2, 6), ... (5, 8)]\"\nSo the full snake is: Head (2,5) -> (2,6) -> ... -> Tail (5,8).\nThe tail is (5,8).\nThe segment in front of the tail is (4,8).\nSo on the next move (if I don't eat an apple), (5,8) becomes empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,4):\nNew Head: (2,4).\nNew Body: (2,5), (2,6)... (5,8).\nTail leaves (5,8).\nPath is clear.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5):\nNew Head: (3,5).\nNew Body: (2,5), (2,6)... (5,8).\nTail leaves (5,8).\nPath is clear.\n\nOkay, both are safe.\n\nWhy choose DOWN?\nThe apple at (3,2) is slightly closer (4 moves vs 5 moves for (7,5)).\nThe apple at (3,2) is in column 3. My body occupies (3,9) and (3,8).\nIf I go to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)... I am in column 3.\nIf I eat the apple at (3,2), I grow. My tail (5,8) will NOT move. So (5,8) stays occupied.\nMy body now extends.\nHead (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> ... wait, if I go (2,5)->(2,4)->(2,3)->(3,3)->(3,2).\nThe path is: (2,5)->(2,4)->(2,3)->(3,3)->(3,2).\nIf I eat at (3,2), the tail (5,8) stays.\nSo my body becomes:\n(3,2), (2,2)? No.\nCurrent body: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8).\nAfter moving DOWN (2,4):\nBody: (2,5), (2,6), ..., (5,8).\nAfter moving DOWN (2,3):\nBody: (2,4), ..., (5,8).\nAfter moving RIGHT (3,3):\nBody: (2,3), ..., (5,8).\nAfter moving DOWN (3,2) (wait, I need to go to y=2).\nFrom (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,2).\nApple is at (3,2).\nSo: (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\nAt (3,2), I eat. Tail (5,8) stays.\nThe body becomes: (3,2), (2,2)? No, the body is the previous path + the old tail until I eat.\nSequence:\nTurn 1: Move to (2,4). Tail (5,8) leaves. Body: (2,5)...(4,8).\nTurn 2: Move to (2,3). Tail (4,8) leaves. Body: (2,4)...(3,8).\nTurn 3: Move to (3,3). Tail (3,8) leaves. Body: (2,3)...(4,8)? No.\nLet's trace the tail.\nOriginal tail: (5,8). Segment before tail: (4,8).\nTurn 1: I move. Head moves to (2,4). New body: (2,5), (2,6)... (5,8). The tail (5,8) stays if I eat. I don't eat.\nTurn 1 result: Head (2,4). Body (2,5)...(5,8). Wait, (5,8) is the tail. The segment before it is (4,8).\nSo (5,8) disappears. New tail is (4,8).\nTurn 2: Move to (2,3). New body: (2,4), (2,5)... (4,8). Tail (4,8) disappears. New tail is (3,8).\nTurn 3: Move to (3,3). New body: (2,3), (2,4)... (3,8). Tail (3,8) disappears. New tail is (2,9).\nTurn 4: Move to (3,2). Eat apple.\nMy body becomes: (3,2), (2,3), ... (2,9), (3,9), (3,8)? No, the tail (2,9) stays.\nWait, let's re-read the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment... The tail does not move that turn.\"\nSo at Turn 4:\nI move to (3,2).\nThe tail (which was at (2,9) at the end of Turn 3) stays at (2,9).\nThe new body is (3,2), (3,3)? No.\nCurrent body at start of Turn 4 (after Turn 3 move): Head (3,3). Body: (2,3), (2,4), ..., (2,9).\nThe tail is (2,9).\nI move to (3,2).\nI eat.\nThe tail (2,9) does NOT move.\nThe new body is: (3,2) (new head), (3,3) (old head), (2,3) (old neck), ..., (2,9) (tail).\nThis looks correct.\nIs (3,2) safe from my own body?\nThe body goes through (2,3), (2,4)...\nSo (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)? No, the body is at (2,3) and (2,4).\n(3,2) is safe from my body.\nIs it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (4,9). Safe.\n\nOkay, the path to (3,2) is good.\n\nNow, why might RIGHT be better?\nThe apple at (7,5).\nPath: (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5).\nDistance 5 moves.\nAt (7,5), I eat.\nCurrent tail is (5,8). It will move 5 times.\nSo if I eat at Turn 5, the tail moves from (5,8) -> ... -> roughly where?\nTurn 1 (Right): Tail moves from (5,8) to (4,8).\nTurn 2 (Right): Tail moves to (3,8).\nTurn 3 (Right): Tail moves to (2,9)? No, the body is (2,5)...(3,8). The tail is (3,8) at start of turn 3. It moves to (2,9).\nTurn 4 (Right): Tail moves to (2,8).\nTurn 5 (Right): Tail moves to (2,7). I eat at (7,5).\nSo the path (3,5) through (6,5) is clear. My body will be at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)... and the tail will be at (2,7).\n(2,7) is far from the path.\nSo the path to (7,5) is also safe.\n\nWhich apple is safer to get?\n(3,2) is in column 3. My body has a segment at (3,9). That's far away.\n(7,5) is in row 5. My body has a segment at (2,5) (the old head). That is on the same row.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), the old head (2,5) becomes part of the body.\nIf I get the apple at (3,2), I stay in column 2 mostly, then pivot to column 3.\nIf I get the apple at (7,5), I stay in row 5.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nEnemy Head: (4,9).\nApples near enemy: (7,5), (7,3), (9,2). The enemy is close to (7,5).\nDistance from (4,9) to (7,5) is 3 + 4 = 7.\nDistance from (4,9) to (7,3) is 3 + 6 = 9.\nThe enemy is far from the apples I am looking at, but they might go for (7,5).\nIf the enemy goes for (7,5), and I go for (7,5), we might collide.\nThe enemy is at (4,9). To get to (7,5), they need to go DOWN and RIGHT.\nThey might go DOWN to (4,8). (4,8) is empty for them.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), we are converging on the right side.\n\nIs there an apple closer to the enemy?\n(8,1) is far.\n(9,2) is far.\n(7,5) is the closest to enemy (7 units).\nClosest to me: (3,2) is 4 units.\n\nIf the enemy goes for (7,5), and I go for (3,2), we are on opposite sides.\nIf the enemy goes for (7,5), and I go for (7,5), we might race.\n\nLet's assume the enemy is smart and will go for the closest apple.\nClosest apple to (4,9) is (7,5) (dist 7).\nClosest apple to (2,5) is (3,2) (dist 4) and (7,5) (dist 5).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am competing for (7,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I am going for (3,2).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,4), my head is at (2,4).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (2,3).\nThen I can go RIGHT to (3,3).\nThen DOWN to (3,2).\nThis is a safe, distinct path.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), I am moving into the \"arena\".\nThe enemy might move DOWN to (4,8).\nIf I continue Right, I go to (4,5).\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)... we collide.\nThe enemy is 5 steps away from row 5. I am on row 5.\nI will reach row 5 immediately. The enemy needs 4 turns to reach row 5.\nSo if I stay on row 5, I am there before the enemy.\nHowever, if I go to (7,5), and the enemy goes to (4,5) then (5,5) etc., they might follow.\nBut I am faster to the apple on row 5.\n\nHowever, the apple at (3,2) is safer because it's in a \"dead end\" area (column 2/3) where the enemy is unlikely to go initially. The enemy is at the top right.\nThe apple at (7,5) is in the open.\n\nLet's calculate the time to eat:\nMe to (3,2): 4 turns.\nMe to (7,5): 5 turns.\nEnemy to (7,5): approx 7 turns.\n\nSo I can definitely eat (7,5) before the enemy gets there, unless the enemy takes a shortcut (unlikely).\nSo (7,5) is safe to take.\nBut (3,2) is even safer because the enemy won't be there.\n\nLet's reconsider the move.\nI am at (2,5).\nOption A: DOWN -> (2,4). Proceeds to (3,2).\nOption B: RIGHT -> (3,5). Proceeds to (7,5).\n\nIs there any trap with going DOWN?\nI go to (2,4). My body is at (2,6).\nNext turn I go to (2,3). Body (2,5).\nNext turn I go to (3,3). Body (2,4).\nNext turn I go to (3,2). Body (2,3).\nI eat. Tail (2,9) stays.\nIs there any blockage?\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . A . . `\nRow 2: ` . . . A . . . . . A `\nPath is clear.\n\nIs there a trap with going RIGHT?\nI go to (3,5). Body (2,5).\nNext turn I go to (4,5). Body (3,5).\n...\nI go to (7,5).\nPath is clear.\n\nWhich one helps me win?\nI have 8 apples. Enemy has 10.\nI need to catch up.\nEating (3,2) gets me to 9.\nEating (7,5) gets me to 9.\n\nIf I eat (3,2), I am closer to the other apples on the left side (maybe?).\nThere is an apple at (8,1) and (9,2) on the right.\nThere is an apple at (7,3) on the right.\nThere is an apple at (3,2) on the left.\nThere is an apple at (7,5) in the middle.\n\nIf I eat (3,2), I am on the left. The enemy is on the right.\nIf I eat (7,5), I move to the center/right. The enemy is on the right.\nMoving to the center/right puts me closer to the enemy.\nStaying left separates us.\n\nSeparation is usually good when you are behind? No, when you are behind, you need to eat. The right side has 3 apples ((7,5), (7,3), (9,2), (8,1)). The left side has 1 ((3,2)).\nWait, (3,2) is the only apple on the left.\n(8,1), (9,2), (7,3), (7,5) are on the right/center.\nSo to win, I probably need to go to the right side eventually.\nThe enemy has 10 apples. They are likely hunting the right side apples.\nIf I stay left, I eat (3,2). Then I have to cross the board to get more apples.\nIf I go right now, I start hunting the cluster of apples on the right.\nThis puts me in competition with the enemy.\nBut the enemy is at (4,9). They are far.\nI am at (2,5).\nI can get to (7,5) in 5 turns.\nThe enemy can get to (7,5) in at least 6-7 turns (must come down).\nSo I can take (7,5) and then continue to (7,3) or (9,2).\nIf I take (3,2) first, I spend 4 turns. Then I have to go to the right.\nIf I go right now, I save time.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: ` . . T T T T . T T T ` (Indices 0-9).\nMy body is at `(2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9)` in column 2.\nThe enemy body is at `(5,9), (6,9)...` and `(8,8), (7,8)...`.\nRow 8 is mostly occupied by the enemy (indices 5-9).\nRow 7: ` . . T . . . . T T . `\nRow 6: ` . . T . . . . . . . `\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), I am entering the \"empty\" space between me and the enemy.\nThe enemy is blocked by its own body on row 8 and 9.\nTo get to row 5, they must go down.\nThey can go DOWN to (4,8). (4,8) is empty.\nThen (4,7). Empty.\nThen (4,6). Empty.\nThen (4,5).\nIf I am at (7,5) by then, I am safe.\nIf I am at (4,5), we collide.\n\nLet's simulate the race for (7,5).\nMy moves: (2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5)->(5,5)->(6,5)->(7,5).\nEnemy moves:\nTurn 1: (4,9)->(4,8).\nTurn 2: (4,8)->(4,7).\nTurn 3: (4,7)->(4,6).\nTurn 4: (4,6)->(4,5).\nTurn 5: (4,5)->(5,5) or (3,5).\nAt Turn 4, I am at (6,5). Enemy is at (4,5).\nAt Turn 5, I eat at (7,5). Enemy moves to (5,5).\nWe are safe.\n\nWait, what if the enemy goes for (7,5) aggressively?\nTurn 1: (4,9)->(5,9)? No, that's body.\nTurn 1: (4,9)->(4,8).\nTurn 2: (4,8)->(5,8)? (5,8) is my tail! If the enemy moves into my body, they die.\nWait, look at the board:\nRow 8: `. . T T T T . T T T`\nIndex 2 is `T` (My body at (2,8)? No, my body is at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). So Row 8 Index 2 is my body.\nRow 8 Index 3 is `T` (My body at (3,8)? No, my body list has (3,9) and (3,8). Yes, (3,8) is my body.\nRow 8 Index 4 is `T` (My body at (4,8)? No, my body list has (4,8). Yes.\nRow 8 Index 5 is `T` (Enemy body at (5,8)? No, enemy body is (5,9), (6,9)... Wait, the board shows `T` at 5.\nLet's check the board mapping.\nRow 8: ` . . T T T T . T T T `\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy body: `(2,8)` is at index 2. `(3,8)` at 3. `(4,8)` at 4.\nEnemy body: `(5,9)` is row 9. `(6,9)` row 9.\n`(9,8)` is index 9. `(8,8)` is index 8. `(7,8)` is index 7.\nSo row 8 has: my body at 2,3,4. Enemy body at 7,8,9.\nIndex 5 and 6 are empty.\nSo (5,8) and (6,8) are empty.\nIf the enemy is at (4,9) and goes DOWN to (4,8), that's my body!\nWait, my body is at (4,8).\nSo if the enemy goes DOWN from (4,9) to (4,8), they hit my body and die.\nThe enemy CANNOT go DOWN.\nThey must go LEFT to (3,9), but (3,9) is my body.\nThey must go RIGHT to (5,9), but (5,9) is their body (neck).\nWait, their body is `[(5, 9), ...]`. So (5,9) is occupied.\nSo the enemy at (4,9) is trapped?\nLet's check their neck: (5,9).\nTheir body: (6,9)... (7,9)...\nSo (4,9) is surrounded by:\nUP: (4,10) - Board edge.\nDOWN: (4,8) - My body.\nLEFT: (3,9) - My body.\nRIGHT: (5,9) - Their neck.\nSo the enemy has NO safe moves. They will die this turn!\n\nIf the enemy dies this turn, I win immediately (unless I die).\nI must not die.\nThe enemy dies if they move into a body.\nIf they stay still (impossible), they die?\nRules: \"If you move outside the board... you die. If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\"\nIf they have no valid moves, they might be forced to make a bad move or the system handles it. Usually, they must pick a direction. If all directions are fatal, they die.\nAssuming they make a move, they will collide with a body and die.\n\nIf the enemy dies, I just need to stay alive.\nI can win immediately.\nI should just pick a safe move.\n\nSafe moves for me:\nUP: (2,6) - My body. DEAD.\nDOWN: (2,4) - Empty. SAFE.\nLEFT: (1,5) - Empty. SAFE.\nRIGHT: (3,5) - Empty. SAFE.\n\nI just need to stay alive.\nDo I want to eat an apple?\nIf I eat an apple, I grow. But if the enemy dies, the game ends and I win. Eating an apple doesn't change the win (I have 8, they have 10, but they are dead). Wait, the rules say: \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\nSo I don't need to eat. I just need to survive this turn.\n\nHowever, if the enemy is trapped, maybe they will make a move that kills them.\nIf I go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, I am safe.\nIs there any risk of head-on collision?\nEnemy is at (4,9).\nMy moves: (2,4), (1,5), (3,5).\nEnemy moves: Must be fatal for them.\nIf they move DOWN to (4,8) (my body), they die.\nIf they move LEFT to (3,9) (my body), they die.\nIf they move RIGHT to (5,9) (their body), they die.\nIf they move UP (off board), they die.\n\nSo they die regardless.\nI just need to not hit myself or walls.\nMy tail is at (5,8). If I go DOWN to (2,4), my tail moves to (4,8).\nWait, (4,8) is currently occupied by my body.\nAt the start of the turn, my body includes (4,8).\nIf I move DOWN, my head goes to (2,4). My body shifts.\nThe segment at (2,6) becomes (2,5).\nThe segment at (2,7) becomes (2,6).\n...\nThe segment at (4,8) becomes (4,7).\nThe tail (5,8) becomes (5,7)? No, the tail (5,8) leaves.\nSo (5,8) becomes empty.\n(4,8) becomes (4,7).\n\nIf the enemy moves to (4,8), is (4,8) occupied?\nAt the start of the turn, (4,8) is occupied by my body.\nSo if the enemy moves to (4,8), they hit my body and die.\nIf I move, I vacate (5,8) and shift.\nBut the collision check happens on the *new* positions.\nSimultaneous moves:\nMy head: (2,5) -> (2,4).\nEnemy head: (4,9) -> (4,8).\nDestination check:\n(2,4): Is it occupied?\nMy body: (2,5), (2,6)... (5,8).\n(2,4) is NOT in my body. Safe.\n(4,8): Is it occupied?\nMy body: (2,5)... (5,8).\n(4,8) IS in my body.\nSo Enemy hits my body. Enemy dies.\nI survive.\n\nSo any move is fine.\nWhich move is best?\nThe enemy dies, so I win.\nI might as well move towards an apple to maximize score, just in case something weird happens (like a tie-breaker if we both die, but I am safe).\nOr just keep playing.\nIf I go DOWN, I am closer to the apple at (3,2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am closer to (7,5).\nBut the enemy dies, so I don't need to rush.\nHowever, the prompt says \"You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\" and \"prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples...\".\n\nSince the enemy is trapped and dies, I am safe.\nI will move DOWN. This continues my descent from the previous turn and keeps me on the path to the apple at (3,2). Even though I don't need to rush, playing normally is good.\n\nWait, let's re-verify the enemy body positions.\nEnemy Body: `[(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]`\nSo at (4,9):\nDown (4,8): Is (4,8) in that list? No.\nIs (4,8) in MY body? Yes: `[(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]`.\nYes, (4,8) is my body.\nSo Enemy cannot go DOWN.\n\nLeft (3,9): Is (3,9) in Enemy body? No.\nIs (3,9) in MY body? Yes.\nSo Enemy cannot go LEFT.\n\nRight (5,9): Is (5,9) in Enemy body? Yes, it's the first element.\nSo Enemy cannot go RIGHT.\n\nUp (4,10): Off board.\nSo Enemy has no safe moves.\n\nTherefore, I am safe.\nI will choose DOWN.\nDOWN is consistent with my previous plan to get the apple at (3,2).\nEven if the enemy somehow survives (impossible based on provided data), DOWN is a safe move.\n\nWait, is there any scenario where I die?\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), is (2,4) occupied?\nMy body: (2,5), (2,6)... (5,8).\n(2,4) is empty.\nSo I am safe.\n\nLet's check the coordinates one last time.\nMy body:\n(2,5) is the neck? No, head is (2,5).\nWait, the prompt says:\n\"My snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (2, 5)\n  - Body: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]\"\n\nSo the full snake is:\nHead: (2, 5)\nBody segment 1: (2, 6)\nBody segment 2: (2, 7)\n...\nBody segment 5: (3, 9)\nBody segment 6: (3, 8)\nBody segment 7: (4, 8)\nBody segment 8: (5, 8) <--- Tail\n\nSo if I move DOWN:\nHead becomes (2, 4).\nBody becomes: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8).\nTail (5, 8) leaves.\nSo the new body set is: {(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8)}.\nIs (2,4) in this set? No.\nIs (2,4) on the board? Yes (0..9).\nIs (2,4) an apple? No, apples are at (3,2), (8,1), (7,3), (7,5), (9,2).\nSo (2,4) is empty.\nSo I survive.\n\nThe enemy moves to (4,8).\nIs (4,8) in my body?\nMy body (before I move) includes (4,8).\nSo yes.\nTherefore, the enemy hits my body and dies.\n\nI win.\nI will move DOWN.\n\nDouble check: The prompt says \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples.\" and \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\nSo the game ends this turn.\nI just need to not die.\nDOWN is safe.\n\nIs there any reason to move LEFT or RIGHT?\nLEFT (1,5) is safe.\nRIGHT (3,5) is safe.\nBut DOWN is consistent with the previous long-term plan (go to (3,2)).\n\nWait, if the enemy dies, do I need to go to (3,2)?\nI will have 8 apples. The enemy has 10.\nIf the enemy dies, do I get their apples?\nNo, the rules don't say that. I win by default because I am the only one alive.\n\" If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\nIt doesn't say I inherit their score.\nSo I win with 8 apples vs their 10? Yes.\n\"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples. If multiple snakes reach 50 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\"\n\"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\nSo death takes precedence over score count for the \"alive\" condition.\n\nSo I don't need the apple.\nBut moving DOWN is fine.\n\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 5: ` . . 0 . . . . A . . `\nIf I go DOWN, I go to Row 4.\nRow 4: ` . . . . . . . . . . `\nThis is a safe, open space.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I go to (1,5). Row 5: ` . 0 . . . . . . . . `? No, row 5 is ` . . 0 . . . . A . . `.\nIndex 0: `.`\nIndex 1: `.`\nIndex 2: `0`\nIndex 3: `.`\n...\nSo (1,5) is empty.\nIf I go RIGHT, (3,5) is empty.\n\nAll moves are safe.\nI will stick with DOWN.\n\nWait, let's look at the enemy's position again.\nHead: (4, 9).\nBody: `(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)`\nIs (3, 9) in the body? No.\nIs (4, 8) in the body? No.\nSo the enemy is surrounded by MY body at (3,9) and (4,8).\nMy body: `[(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]`\nYes, (3,9) and (4,8) are mine.\nSo the enemy is trapped.\nConfirmed.\n\nI will choose DOWN.\n\nFinal check of coordinates.\nMy head: (2,5).\nDown: (2,4).\nIs (2,4) safe from my body?\nMy body list: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8).\n(2,4) is not in the list.\nIs it on the board? Yes (y=4 is valid).\nIs it an apple? No.\nSo safe.\n\nI will output DOWN.\n\nOne minor detail: The enemy might choose a move that avoids hitting my body? No, all moves are fatal.\nDown -> hits my body (4,8).\nLeft -> hits my body (3,9).\nRight -> hits own body (5,9).\nUp -> off board.\nSo they are guaranteed to die.\n\nI am safe.\nI will move DOWN.\n\nWait, what if the enemy moves into my body and dies, but I move into a spot that becomes occupied by the enemy? No, the enemy dies, so they are removed (or just dead).\nThe rules: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nSo the enemy dies, my body remains. I survive.\n\nI am confident in DOWN.\n\nOne last check on the prompt: \"Long-term plan or strategy note to your future self\".\nI can include this.\n\"Enemy is trapped at (4,9) surrounded by my body. They will die this turn regardless of their move. I am safe to continue moving DOWN towards the apple at (3,2).\"\n\nThis seems appropriate.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I must put the plan before the final word.\nThe plan should be enclosed in `**START LAST RATIONALE**` ... `**END LAST RATIONALE**` if I want it to be treated as the \"last rationale\" for the next turn?\nThe prompt says: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nIt doesn't strictly require the tags if I am just thinking out loud, but the previous turn used them.\nIf I use the tags, it will be displayed as the \"last rationale\" in the next turn.\nThe prompt says: \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should use the tags.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\nEnemy is trapped. I am safe. Moving DOWN continues the plan to the apple at (3,2).\n\nWait, is there any chance the enemy doesn't die?\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies...\"\nIf the enemy moves to (4,8), it hits my body.\nIf the enemy moves to (3,9), it hits my body.\nIf the enemy moves to (5,9), it hits its own body.\nIf the enemy moves to (4,10), it hits the wall.\nAll are fatal.\n\nSo yes, they die.\n\nI will proceed with DOWN.\n\nOne final check: Is it possible the enemy moves to a spot that I am vacating?\nIf I move DOWN, I leave (2,5).\nThe enemy is at (4,9). They are moving to (4,8) or (3,9) or (5,9). They cannot reach (2,5).\nSo no interaction there.\n\nOkay, safe.\n\nI'll output the rationale and the move.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nI will output:\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n[Analysis]\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN\n\nWait, I should not add anything after the word DOWN.\nThe format should be:\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n...\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN\n\nOr just the text then DOWN.\nThe prompt example from previous turn had tags.\nI will use the tags to be consistent with the format provided in the example.\nThe example had:\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**Analysis of Current State:**\n...\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nI will follow that structure.\n\nWait, the user said: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo the line \"DOWN\" must be the very last thing.\nEverything else goes above it.\n\nI'll write the rationale.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**Analysis of Current State:**\n\n*   **Enemy Trap:** Snake #1 is at (4, 9). Their potential moves are:\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 8):** Occupied by my body (`(4, 8)` is in `[(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]`).\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 9):** Occupied by my body (`(3, 9)` is in my list).\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Occupied by their own body (neck).\n    *   **UP to (4, 10):** Off the board.\n    *   **Result:** Snake #1 has **no safe moves** and will die this turn regardless of their choice.\n\n*   **My Safety:**\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 4):** Target cell is empty, on the board, and not occupied by my body.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n*   **Strategic Decision:**\n    Since the opponent is guaranteed to die, I simply need to avoid suicide to secure the win. I will continue with my previous plan to move towards the apple at (3, 2). Moving **DOWN** is consistent with this goal and maintains the safe vertical path in column 2.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
