No enemy head can reach either target (enemy at (1,6); max reach col 2 this turn). No head-on risk. Own tail vacates (5,2) this turn (no eat).\n\n### Enemy Moves and Risks\nEnemy head (1,6), length 6. Possible safe moves: LEFT off-board (death); RIGHT (2,6) empty; DOWN (1,5) own body (death, backward); UP (1,7) empty. Likely RIGHT to (2,6) toward (3,7) apple (dist 4 post-move, clear path cols 2-3 rows 6-7). Alt UP to (1,7) for (3,7) via left/up. No south/east push; remains cols 0-2. No threat to my south/east positions. Tail vacates (0,2).\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\nBoth safe; prefer LEFT to (7,0) per plan\u2014directly south of (7,1) apple for immediate UP eat next turn (no delay vs. UP path, but better aligns body for (6,1) follow-up without extra row-1 extension). Post-LEFT: body pulls tail east/south, vacating row 2 faster (~turn 24 full clear col 5-9 row 2). Avoids minor body bulge at (8,1). Secure double-eat: turn 22 UP eat (7,1) score 8/len 9; turn 23 LEFT eat (6,1) score 9/len 10. Enemy can't contest south apples (dist 8+). Lead to 9 apples by turn 23 (>3 over enemy). Then north col 6 safe (row 2 clears).\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nLEFT to (7,0). Turn 22: UP (7,1) eat. Turn 23: LEFT (6,1) eat (safe, empty).

Alt if enemy nears (3,7): detour LEFT from (6,6) to block. Post-eat, RIGHT/UP to (9,5) ~turn 32 (dist 6, east clear). Maintain cols 5+; aim 12 apples by turn 35 (deny enemy 2-3 via position).

Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,1): Own body (directly behind head). Death.  \nSafe: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Enemy head (3,7) Manhattan dist 7+; can't reach my position this turn (possible enemy moves: RIGHT to (4,7) empty toward (7,7), UP (3,8) empty, LEFT (2,7) empty; DOWN own body death). No head-on risk.\n\n### Enemy Moves and Risks\nEnemy likely targets nearest apple (7,7) dist 4, clear path RIGHT x4: t24 (4,7), t25 (5,7), t26 (6,7), t27 (7,7) eat (7 apples). Then to (6,9) dist 3: LEFT (6,7) t28, UP x2 t30 eat (8 apples). Alt: direct to (6,9) RIGHT x3 UP x2 (5 moves) t28 eat but skips (7,7); less likely as (7,7) quicker. (2,5) dist 3 but blocked by own body\u2014requires detour (e.g., RIGHT DOWN DOWN LEFT LEFT, 5 moves t28 eat), riskier than (7,7). Assume (7,7) priority. Enemy stays north/central; no threat to south/east this turn. My growth (len10) outpaces (len7).\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\nUP follows efficient path to uncontested (9,5) apple (Manhattan 7, clear via body-slide): t24 UP (6,2), t25 RIGHT (7,2 safe tail-vacate), t26 RIGHT (8,2 safe), t27 RIGHT (9,2 safe), t28 UP (9,3), t29 (9,4), t30 (9,5) eat (10 apples/len11). Secures lead (10 vs enemy ~8 post-t30). DOWN/LEFT detour south/west toward low-value (1,2)/(2,5) (dist 5-6, enemy proximity risk post-north eats); wastes position, invites trap. North path (col6 UP) reaches (6,9) t31 after enemy t30\u20140 gain, trapped behind. Post-(9,5): head east row5; pivot west row5 to (2,5) if uneaten (~4 moves t34 eat, dist 7 left, empty path), or block enemy south creep. Deny enemy east via len11 control cols7-9; force west (1,2)/(2,5) contest where my speed/lead traps them. Goal: 12+ apples by t40, eliminate via growth/collision.\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nUP to initiate (9,5) path (10 apples t30/len11). Monitor enemy\u2014if deviates to (6,9) direct (t28 eat, skips (7,7)), reassess t26 at (8,2): UP-chain col8 to (8,9) empty then LEFT (7,9) DOWN x2 (7,7) eat t32 alt-path (dist 5 from (8,2), cols7-8 rows3-9 clear). If enemy takes (7,7) as expected, (6,9) uncontested but I ignore for (9,5) efficiency; post-t30 from (9,5) LEFT x7 to (2,5) t37 eat if available (row5 cols8-3 empty post-body pull), or UP to row9 col9 empty to flank enemy.

Likely LEFT toward (0,9) apple (5 lefts, eat t36-37 to 9 apples). If DOWN, gets stuck short-term (next DOWN to own body at (5,7); detour left/right blocked by own segments). Can't reach my row 6 path soon (min 8+ turns to (4,6), blocked by body). No threat to (8,6) or follow-ups.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\nLEFT advances core plan: 4 more LEFTs along clear row 6 to (4,6) apple (eat t36, 11 apples), grows safely (path empty, no enemy intercept). Secures lead (11-8/9), positions center for quick chain: DOWN-LEFT-LEFT to (2,5) t39 (12 apples), LEFT-DOWNx3 to (1,2) t43 (13 apples). Total +3 by t43, enemy max +1 (to 9). Avoids (9,0) for now (south path blocked by own body; detour risks 5+ turns vs chain efficiency). UP wastes turn in top-right corner (limited space: (9,7/8),(8,7/8/9); enemy body blocks left at col7 row7/8; backtrack needed, delays eats by 2 turns).

Post-t43: snake longer (~14 seg), body follows west; pivot south/east for (9,0) (~6 moves via row 2/1 clear paths, eat t49 to 14) or patrol center (new apples spawn). If enemy surprises (e.g., DOWN detour), at t36 if (4,6) at risk (unlikely), from (5,6) DOWN to row5 for (2,5) alt (eat t37). Target 20+ by t70, dominate board.  \n**END RATIONALE**  \nLEFT",

Secures center-west control ahead of enemy. Post-eat: From (4,6) t37 LEFT (3,6 empty), t38 LEFT (2,6 empty), t39 DOWN (2,5) eat (12). Then to (1,2): t40 DOWN (2,4 empty), t41 LEFT (1,4 empty), t42 DOWN (1,3 empty), t43 DOWN (1,2) eat (13). Leads 13-9 by t43; enemy max 9 t36 + detour 5+ to (1,2) t44+ (10). UP/DOWN skips (4,6), lets enemy potentially claim later (t39+ for 9-10), reduces my lead/options. LEFT maximizes apples, keeps west chain open, positions to patrol east (9,0) t48+ uncontested. Avoids trapping east in my long body.\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nEaten (4,6) t36 (11), now at (4,6) head. LEFT x2 DOWN to (2,5) t39 eat (12). DOWN LEFT DOWN x2 to (1,2) t43 eat (13). RIGHT/DOWN to row1 east, then DOWN to (9,0) t48 eat (14). Enemy eats (0,9) t36 (9) if LEFT, trapped NW by my west chain (min t45 to (9,0) for 10); if DOWN, behind on west apples (max 10 t41 vs my 12). Secure south-west, expand east; aim 15+ by t50, deny enemy center. Monitor enemy growth/death risks.  \n**END RATIONALE**  \nLEFT",

Immediate eat (12 apples, grow to 13); no self/enemy overlap. Tail stays (9,2) due to growth.  \n- LEFT (1,6): Empty, safe.

Secures +3 apples uncontested by t43 (score 14-9/10), vs. LEFT netting only (1,4)t41 (+1) and yielding (2,5) to enemy (score 12-10). UP delays, risks enemy center dominance.

UP diverts north, complicating return (down from (1,5) hits own body at (1,4); requires detour). DOWN maximizes eats while keeping 3+ safe follow-ups from (1,3) (DOWN eat, RIGHT empty, LEFT potentially open if enemy DOWN).\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nPost-DOWN t42 at (1,3) non-eat (len14, tail vacates (9,3)).

No (9,3) vacated t42, row4 T (9,4) still body until tail shifts (current tail (9,3), but chain moves tail forward).

No immediate overlap with enemy future positions.  \n- DOWN (2,1): Empty, safe.  \n- LEFT (1,2): Own neck, backwards collision, death.  \n- RIGHT (3,2): Empty, safe.  \nAll non-LEFT safe. Enemy at (0,1): safe moves DOWN (0,0) or RIGHT (1,1); neither new head contests mine ((2,3),(2,1),(3,2)). Enemy future bodies stay in col0/1 low rows or extend to (1,1)+(col0 y=1-9), no overlap with my targets. My future body shifts right/west no self-collide.\n\n### Enemy Moves and Risks\nEnemy likely DOWN to (0,0) to chase row0 apples (slow: reaches (4,0) t49, post-my t48 eat, hits my body at (4,0) as neck). If RIGHT to (1,1), then RIGHTs to row1 east: reaches (4,1) t48, hits my body (my t47 head at (4,1) becomes neck). Or DOWN from (1,1) slower. Can't reach (1,6) apple (blocked by my col1 body y=2-4 long-term). No threat to my southeast path; length advantage (15 vs 10) contains enemy west/south.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\nRIGHT follows plan: advances to (4,0) t48 eat #15 uncontested, then (6,1) t51 #16. Keeps row2 open for evasion (cols3-9 clear) vs row1 (potential enemy incursion). UP diverts north into own body risk (next UP hits (2,4)). DOWN viable alt to (4,0) via row1 t48, but narrower, risks if enemy RIGHTs east. Prioritizes speed to (4,0)/(6,1), lead 14-9 to 16-9, then (8,7) t59 #17 (path clears as tail vacates row6 east by t50+). Ignore (1,6) trapped; alt scoop (9,0) t53 if enemy chases south. Goal: 20+ apples by t60, encircle north/east, trap enemy.\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nContinue RIGHT t45 (3,2), RIGHT t46 (4,2), DOWN t47 (4,1), DOWN t48 (4,0) eat #15 (len16, tail ~ (9,6) holds then shifts). RIGHT t49 (5,0), RIGHT t50 (6,0), UP t51 (6,1) eat #16 (len17).

If enemy RIGHT t45 to (1,1) threatens row1, pivot post-(4,0): RIGHT x5 t49-53 to (9,0) eat #15 earlier (len16), UP/LEFT to (8,7) t58 #16 (row0 cols5-9 open). Tail vacates (9,5/6),(8,6) t45-48, opens east/north. Enemy south loop too slow (t54+ to (9,0) hits body); if RIGHT suicide, free row1.
