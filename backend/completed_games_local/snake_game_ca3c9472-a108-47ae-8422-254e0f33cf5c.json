          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n**Board State:**\n- My snake (ID 1) is at (2, 4).\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (0, 9).\n- Apples are at (2, 3), (0, 7), (5, 1), (5, 7), (9, 4).\n\n**Possible Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **UP (increase Y):** Target position (2, 5). This is within bounds. The cell is empty. It doesn't trap me immediately. This keeps me on the column towards potential future apples or movement.\n2.  **DOWN (decrease Y):** Target position (2, 3). This is an apple location. Eating it is good. However, I must consider that after eating, my tail won't move, effectively blocking the spot I just left (2, 4). This means I can't immediately go back up. But moving to (2, 3) opens up Left (2, 2) and Right (2, 4) (blocked next turn), and Down (2, 2). This is a strong move.\n3.  **LEFT (decrease X):** Target position (1, 4). This is within bounds. The cell is empty.\n4.  **RIGHT (increase X):** Target position (3, 4). This is within bounds. The cell is empty.\n\n**Evaluating \"Bad\" Moves:**\n- None of the moves lead immediately off-board or into a body. The board is currently very open.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- I am at (2, 4).\n- I see an apple at (2, 3). This is **DOWN**.\n- I also see an apple at (2, 3) is very close.\n- I see an apple at (0, 7), which is somewhat close, but (2, 3) is closer.\n- I see an apple at (9, 4) which is very far.\n- I see an apple at (5, 7) and (5, 1).\n\nSince I am at (2, 4) and there is an apple at (2, 3), moving **DOWN** is the most immediate and rewarding safe move. It increases my score and length. I should avoid getting stuck in the corner, but currently, (2, 3) allows movement to (1, 3), (3, 3), or (2, 2) (if I don't eat an apple immediately after, which I might want to).\n\nWait, let me double check the apple locations relative to my position (2, 4):\n- (2, 3) is DOWN.\n- (0, 7) is UP and LEFT.\n- (5, 1) is DOWN and RIGHT.\n- (5, 7) is UP and RIGHT.\n- (9, 4) is SAME Y, RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (2, 3) is the closest and in a straight line.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:** Located at (0, 9). This is top-left. It is not an immediate threat to me at (2, 4).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (2, 3) eats an apple and is safe. It doesn't immediately trap me (I can go Left, Right, or Down again next turn, provided I don't immediately eat another apple that blocks my tail).\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating the apple at (2, 3), I will be at (2, 3) with a length of 2. My tail will stay at (2, 4). I will be blocked from moving UP. I should consider moving Left to (1, 3), Right to (3, 3), or Down to (2, 2). I will scout for the next apple. The apple at (0, 7) is a good long-term target if I can navigate safely. The apple at (5, 1) is also accessible.\n\nLet's stick with the immediate gain.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (3, 3). Empty. Safe.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n- **DOWN to (2, 2):** Moves towards apples at (5, 1) and (5, 2). (5, 2) is adjacent to (5, 1). I can eat both. If I eat (5, 2), I won't be able to move to (5, 1) immediately next turn because the tail won't clear (5, 2) until the turn after. So the order matters: Eat (5, 1) then (5, 2) is safer, or go around. However, moving Down aligns with the general direction of these apples.\n- **LEFT to (1, 3):** Moves towards (0, 7) generally, but (0, 7) is far. I would hit the left wall (x=0) eventually.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Moves towards (5, 7) and (9, 4). (5, 7) is North-East. (9, 4) is East.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe board has a cluster of apples at x=5. The bottom ones are at (5, 1) and (5, 2). The top one is at (5, 7). Since I am at (2, 3), moving **DOWN** moves me closer to the bottom cluster (5, 1) and (5, 2). This is a productive direction.\nMoving UP is blocked. Moving LEFT is a diversion to a sparse area. Moving RIGHT goes towards a distant apple, but I will eventually have to cross the board anyway.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN towards the x=5 column apples. Once I reach the bottom cluster, I will eat (5, 1) and (5, 2). Then, I will navigate to the right to eat (9, 4) and then move up to (5, 7) and (0, 7). I will avoid the enemy snake #0 at (0, 8) which is near the top-left apple.\n\n**Current Move Decision:**\n**DOWN** is the best move to approach the nearest cluster of apples.\n\nDOWN",

Not ideal.\n\nSince moving **UP** scores an apple and maintains good mobility (options Up, Left, Right in the future), it is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (5, 2).

Identify possible moves:**\n*   **UP:** To (1, 5).\n    *   Coordinates: (1, 5) is within the board (0-9).\n    *   Obstacles: (1, 5) is currently empty ('.' on board row 5).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** To (1, 3).\n    *   Coordinates: (1, 3) is within the board.\n    *   Obstacles: (1, 3) is currently empty ('.' on board row 3).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** To (0, 4).\n    *   Coordinates: (0, 4) is within the board.\n    *   Obstacles: (0, 4) contains an apple ('A').\n    *   Safety: Safe.

Moving into my own body is death.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n*   **LEFT (0, 4):** Moves directly to an apple. This guarantees an apple collection this turn. I will grow, so I must ensure my path remains open.\n*   **UP (1, 5):** Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple at (0, 4).\n*   **DOWN (1, 3):** Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple at (0, 4).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the optimal choice. It allows me to collect the apple at (0, 4) immediately. Currently, I have 4 apples, and the enemy snake has 3. Taking this apple increases my lead to 5-3. The path is clear, and there are no immediate threats from the enemy snake at (3, 7).\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (0, 4) to extend length. From (0, 4), I will likely need to move DOWN to navigate towards the apples at (0, 9) or (3, 0). I must be careful of the wall at x=0.\n\nLEFT",

However, this forces me to stay at x=0 for the immediate next move (since I can't go LEFT or BACK to (0,4) immediately as it will still be occupied by my body in the next turn), and eventually I will need to turn RIGHT.

I cannot go RIGHT into my own body. I must go UP or DOWN.\nGoing **UP** is the optimal choice. It moves me towards the cluster of apples at (0, 9) and (2, 5). It keeps my options open to move RIGHT into the board (to x=1) on subsequent turns.

The board shows empty space here.\n    *   *Value:* Moves me 1 step closer to the guaranteed apple at (0, 9). It keeps me on the left edge where I have control. From (0, 6), I can potentially intercept Enemy #0 if they go for (2, 5) or (3, 9), or I can continue north.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Potentially risky. Enemy #0 is at (2, 6). If the enemy moves UP or LEFT, they might collide with me or I with them. Specifically, if I go to (1, 5) and they go to (2, 5) (eating the apple), we are adjacent but safe. However, if they move to (1, 6) or (1, 5), we have a head-on collision or body collision.\n    *   *Value:* Moves me toward the center. However, (0, 9) is a \"free\" score right now. Giving it up seems bad.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DEADLY**. My body segment is currently at (0, 4). Moving down is moving directly into my own neck (backwards).\n\n*   **LEFT:**\n    *   *Safety:* **DEADLY**. Off the board.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nI have a guaranteed point at (0, 9) that I can collect safely in 4 turns (moving straight up). The enemy snake is currently occupied with the center/top-right apples. If I move UP, I maintain my position on the left wall, which is a safe corridor. If I move RIGHT, I enter the chaos of the center where the enemy is located, risking a head-on collision.\n\nGiven the priority of survival and the guaranteed apple reward, **UP** is the only logical choice.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nContinue UP towards (0, 9) to secure the point. Only deviate if the enemy intercepts or an obstacle appears.\n\nUP",

I would immediately collect an apple and grow by 1 segment. Very efficient.\n\n2. **LEFT to (1, 6)** - Moves me closer to the left side, potentially closer to (0, 9) and (0, 4). This avoids the immediate apple competition.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 6)** - Moves me toward the center, keeping multiple options open. This could set up a path to (3, 9) or (3, 0).\n\n## Decision Rationale\n\nThe most immediate and valuable move is **DOWN to (2, 5)** because:\n- It gives me immediate apple collection (4th apple)\n- It's guaranteed food with no risk\n- It improves my score differential (I need to catch up to snake #1)\n- Even if snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1, 5), they won't block this path\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll be at (2, 6) with body growing to [(2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)], and I can reassess the board state.\n\nDOWN",

This could position me to potentially reach that apple next turn if I go RIGHT from (6, 6).\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 4)** - Moves me to the same y-coordinate as the (9, 4) apple. This puts me on the same horizontal level as that apple, making it potentially reachable in two moves if I go RIGHT twice.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7, 5)** - Moves me directly toward the (9, 4) apple, but I'll be at a different y-coordinate. This gives me the most direct path to the far-right apple.\n\n**Enemy Movement Analysis:**\n- If snake #1 goes DOWN to (1, 8), it's moving away from the (0, 3) and (3, 0) apples\n- If snake #1 goes RIGHT to (2, 9), it's moving toward the (3, 9) apple\n\n**Apple Priority Analysis:**\n- (9, 4) - I'm closest, at x=6 currently, this apple is at x=9, y=4\n- (7, 6) - I'm closest, at x=6, y=5, this apple is at x=7, y=6\n- (3, 9) - Snake #1 is closer, it's at x=1, y=9 vs my x=6, y=5\n- (0, 3) - Snake #1 is closer, it's at x=1, y=9 vs my x=6, y=5\n- (3, 0) - I'm closer, at x=6, y=5 vs snake #1 at x=1, y=9\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- The (7, 6) apple is just one move UP and one move RIGHT from me\n- The (9, 4) apple is three moves RIGHT and one move DOWN from me\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- Moving UP to (6, 6) gives me the best chance to reach the (7, 6) apple next turn\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 4) puts me on the same y-level as (9, 4) apple, making it potentially reachable in two RIGHT moves\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) is the most direct path to (9, 4) but I'll be at a different y-level\n\n### Decision Rationale\n\nThe best move is **UP to (6, 6)** because:\n- It positions me optimally to reach the (7, 6) apple on my next turn by going RIGHT from (6, 6)\n- This apple is closer and more immediately reachable than the (9, 4) apple\n- It keeps me moving upward, away from snake #1's current position\n- If snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9), it will be heading toward the (3, 9) apple, so I'm not blocking it\n- If snake #1 moves DOWN to (1, 8), it's moving away from me entirely\n- This move gives me the best immediate apple opportunity\n\n**Long-term plan:** After reaching (6, 6), I should move RIGHT to (7, 6) to collect that apple if it's still there. This will bring me to 5 apples total. From there, I can reassess the board state and look for the next closest apple, likely the (9, 4) apple.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "First, I need to accurately identify my snake's head position. The board description contains a contradiction: the text states my head is at (3, 8), but the text-based map shows '1' at (2, 9) and 'T' at (3, 9). Given the explicit text stating \"Head: (3, 8)\" and \"Body: [(3, 9)...\", I will trust the text list order (Head is index 0). This implies the '1' at (2, 9) in the map is likely a visual glitch or outdated. However, checking the last move rationale confirms the AI played DOWN from (2, 9) to (3, 8). This aligns my head at **(3, 8)**. The body continues to (3, 9), etc.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze immediate survival (Turn 23)**\nHead Position: **(3, 8)**\nNeighbors:\n*   **UP:** (3, 9). My body list starts with (3, 8) -> (3, 9). So (3, 9) is my neck. Moving UP is moving backwards -> **DEATH**.\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 7). The map shows 'A' at (3, 7). The list \"Apples at: (3, 7)\" confirms it is an apple. The board has no 'T' or snake symbols there. -> **SAFE**.\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 8). Map row 8 shows \"...1 . .\" (at x=3). To the left is empty '.' (at x=2). No obstacles listed. -> **SAFE**.\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 8). Map row 8 shows \". . . .\" at x=4. Empty. -> **SAFE**.\n\nSurvival options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Strategy and Future Safety**\nI am in a corner-like position (x=3, y=8) with a long body trailing to the far left/wall.\n\n*   **Option DOWN (to 3,7):** Eating the apple at (3, 7). This increases length. However, the body currently occupies (3, 8) and (3, 9). I will be below my own body. While I can move past it, being stuck below a wall while growing is risky. Also, the apple at (3, 0) is far south, and I am currently high up (y=8). Going down gets me closer to the bottom, but I am stuck behind my own vertical line.\n*   **Option LEFT (to 2,8):** This moves me away from my body column (x=3). The space to the left (columns 0, 1, 2) is mostly clear on row 8. The top row (9) is blocked by my body (0-3) and enemy body (6-7), but row 8 is open. This allows me to traverse the top of the board to the left side apples (0,3) or (0,0) without immediate collision.\n*   **Option RIGHT (to 4,8):** This moves towards the center. Row 8 seems open there too, but the enemy snake #0 is at (7,5) and growing (body goes to 4,5). Moving right brings me closer to the enemy and potential conflict.\n\n**Comparison of LEFT vs DOWN:**\nThe Last Rationale mentioned a plan to go for the apple at (0, 3). To reach (0, 3) from (3, 8):\n*   **Going LEFT (2,8)** keeps me in the top rows where I can easily drop down into the \"tunnel\" at column 0 (rows 9, 8, 7 are 'T' but that's my body, wait... the map shows 'T' at (0,9), (0,8), (0,7)...). Wait, looking at the map:\n    *   Row 9: T T T T ... (My body is at 0,9 to 3,9)\n    *   Row 8: T . . 1 ...\n    *   Row 7: T . . A ...\n    *   Row 6: T . . . ...\n    *   Row 0: . . . A ...\n    \n    The \"T\"s on the left are my body! My body runs down the left edge from (3,9) to (0,6) (based on the list).\n    So, if I go DOWN to (3,7), I am at the mouth of a channel defined by my body on the left (x=0..2? No, x=3 is the body line at y=9, but at y=7/8, my body is at x=0..3? No, list is (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)).\n    \n    Actually, the list is: (3,8) [Head], (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6).\n    So my body fills (0,6) to (3,9).\n    \n    If I am at (3,8):\n    *   DOWN to (3,7): This cell is empty.\n    *   LEFT to (2,8): This cell is empty.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (3,7):\n    Next turn, my tail will vacate (0,6).\n    My body will be (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n    I am effectively trapped in a column (x=3) or will have to squeeze between my body and the wall.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (2,8):\n    Next turn, tail vacates (0,6).\n    Body: (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n    This gives me more freedom of movement on the left side.\n\n**Re-evaluating the \"Last Move\" Logic:**\nThe last rationale said \"The only safe move is DOWN\".\nWait, looking at the provided \"Last Rationale\" text: It claims the head was at (2,9) and moved DOWN to (3,8).\nBut the current state says Head is (3,8).\nIf the head was at (2,9) and moved DOWN to (3,8), then (3,8) is the current head.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" described (2,9) having neighbors:\n*   Up: Out of bounds (10)\n*   Left: (1,9) -> My body\n*   Right: (3,9) -> Enemy (Snake #0)\n*   Down: (2,8) -> Empty\n\nWait, the \"Last Rationale\" says:\n\"1. UP: Y increases to 10... Death.\n2. LEFT: X decreases to 1... The cell (1, 9) contains my own body segment... Death.\n3. DOWN: Y decreases to 8. The board shows row 8, column 2 is empty... Safe.\n4. RIGHT: X increases to 3. The board shows row 9, column 3 contains '0'... Death.\"\n\nAnd the move was DOWN.\nSo the head moved from (2,9) to (3,8).\nCurrent Head: (3,8).\nThis matches the text \"Head: (3, 8)\".\n\nOkay, so the previous head was (2,9).\nWhy did the rationale say (3,9) was Snake #0?\nThe Board Map shows row 9: `T T T T . . . . . .`\nThe text says Snake #0 body is `[(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]`.\nWait, the map shows `T T T T` at the start of row 9.\nMy body text says: `[(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)...]`.\nThe map uses 'T' for something (maybe Tail or Traced). But the snake #0 head is at (7,5).\nWhy did the previous AI think (3,9) was enemy?\nIt said: \"The board shows row 9, column 3 contains '0' (Snake #0's head).\"\nLet's look at the provided map again:\n`9 T T T T . . . . . .`\n`8 T . . 1 . . . . . .`\n`7 T . . A . . . . . .`\n...\n`5 . . . . T T T 0 . .`\n\nAh, the map shows '0' at (7,5). The previous AI hallucinated or misread the map. It thought (3,9) was enemy, but it's actually my body (or 'T').\nHowever, it correctly identified (1,9) as my body (since I was at (2,9), left is (1,9)).\nIt correctly identified Up and Right as invalid.\nSo the move DOWN was safe.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\nHead: (3, 8)\nBody: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6)]\n\nI have an apple at (3, 7) directly below me.\nI have an apple at (0, 3) far below.\n\n**Move Options from (3,8):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (3,7):**\n    *   Pros: Eat apple (+1 score). Moves towards (0,3).\n    *   Cons: I will be at (3,7). My body will be (3,8), (3,9)... I will be trapped in the column x=3. To escape, I must eventually go LEFT or RIGHT. If I go LEFT, I hit my own body at (2,8)? No, (2,8) is currently empty. Wait, my body at y=8 is only at (3,8) (head) and (0,8) (part of the tail stack). The segment (3,9) is at y=9. So (2,8) and (1,8) are empty.\n    *   Wait, look at the body list again: (3,8) is head. Next is (3,9). So the body is (3,9). Then (2,9). Then (1,9). Then (0,9). Then (0,8). Then (0,7). Then (0,6).\n    *   So if I move DOWN to (3,7):\n        *   New Head: (3,7)\n        *   New Body starts: (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n        *   I will be standing at (3,7). My body occupies (3,8) above me and the left wall.\n        *   Next turn, I can go LEFT to (2,7) (safe, as long as tail moves).\n        *   This seems playable.\n\n2.  **LEFT (2,8):**\n    *   Pros: Moves me out of the corner column. Opens up the top area. Safe.\n    *   Cons: Doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n    *   This keeps options open. From (2,8), I can go DOWN to (2,7) or continue LEFT.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (4,8):**\n    *   Pros: Moves center.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the nearest apple (3,7).\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:**\nThe apple at (3,7) is very close.\nThe board shows an apple at (0,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (3,7), I eat the apple. I grow.\nMy body becomes: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6).\nNow I am at (3,7).\nThe gap between me (x=3) and the left wall (x=0) at y=7 is empty (cells (2,7), (1,7) are empty based on map).\nHowever, I need to be careful about the length.\nThe gap between my body at (0,7) and my head at (3,7) is wide enough.\nActually, if I go DOWN, I am at (3,7). My body is immediately above (3,8). The space to the left (2,7) is open.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (2,8). Space to left (1,8) is open. Space down (2,7) is open.\nGoing DOWN gives me the apple. Why hesitate?\nBecause of the \"tight spaces\" rule. The previous turn I was told to avoid trapping myself.\nIf I am at (3,7), and I want to eventually get to (0,3), I will have to navigate down.\nMy body fills the left wall. As I move down, the tail will vacate the bottom cells.\nIf I stay at x=3, I am creating a \"pillar\" of my body. It's safer to move LEFT first, then DOWN, so I am not blocked by my own vertical body if I need to turn back or maneuver.\n\nLet's trace the \"Down\" path:\nTurn 23: Move DOWN to (3,7) [Eat apple].\nTurn 24: Tail leaves (0,6). Head can move LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (3,6), or RIGHT to (4,7).\nIf I go LEFT (2,7), I am safe.\nIf I go DOWN (3,6), I am at (3,6). Map shows row 6, col 3 is empty.\nThis path seems fine.\n\nLet's trace the \"Left\" path:\nTurn 23: Move LEFT to (2,8).\nTurn 24: Tail leaves (0,6). Head can move DOWN to (2,7), LEFT to (1,8), etc.\nFrom (2,7), I can easily drop down the columns 1 or 2 towards the apple at (0,3).\n\n**The Apple at (3,0):**\nThere is an apple at (3,0).\nMy head is at (3,8).\nDirectly below: (3,7) [Apple], (3,6) [Empty], (3,5) [Empty? Row 5 has \"T T T 0\" at x=4,5,6,7. x=3 is '.'], (3,4) [Empty], (3,3) [Empty], (3,2) [Apple], (3,1) [Empty], (3,0) [Apple].\nThe column x=3 is mostly clear down to the bottom!\nRow 5: `. . . . T T T 0 . .` (Indices 0-9). Index 3 is `.`.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . . A` (Apple at 9). Index 3 is `.`.\nRow 3: `A . . . . . . . . .` (Apple at 0). Index 3 is `.`.\nRow 2: `. . . A . . . . . .` (Apple at 3). Index 3 is `A`.\nRow 1: `. . . . . . . . . .` (All empty).\nRow 0: `. . . A . . . . . .` (Apple at 3). Index 3 is `A`.\n\nWait, the apples listed are: (9, 4), (3, 0), (0, 3), (3, 2), (3, 7).\nMap check:\nRow 4, Col 9: 'A'. Correct.\nRow 0, Col 3: 'A'. Correct.\nRow 2, Col 3: 'A'. Correct.\nRow 0, Col 3 is 'A'. Wait, the text says apple at (3,0). Map row 0 says `. . . A ...`. So (3,0) is apple.\nRow 2, Col 3 is 'A' (matches (3,2)).\nSo the column x=3 has apples at y=7, y=2, y=0.\nThere is NO apple at (3,1).\nThe path down column 3 is clear of walls/snakes.\nRow 5, x=3 is empty.\nRow 6, x=3 is empty.\nRow 7, x=3 is 'A' (Wait, row 7 map: `T . . A . .` -> (3,7) is 'A'. Matches).\nRow 8, x=3 is '1' (Current head).\nRow 9, x=3 is 'T' (Body).\n\nSo, the column x=3 is:\n- (3,9): Body\n- (3,8): Head\n- (3,7): Apple (Current target if DOWN)\n- (3,6): Empty\n- (3,5): Empty\n- (3,4): Empty\n- (3,3): Empty\n- (3,2): Apple\n- (3,1): Empty\n- (3,0): Apple\n\nThis is a very strong path. I can just go DOWN, DOWN, DOWN...\nHowever, I need to ensure I don't get blocked by my own body.\nIf I eat at (3,7), I grow.\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (3,6).\nMy body shifts: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), ...\nThe tail moves. The tail is currently at (0,6).\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6), my body occupies (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), ...\nMy body is piling up in the column x=3.\nIs that safe?\nYes, because I am moving in a straight line. As long as the path is clear, I won't hit myself.\nThe only danger is if I need to turn.\nBut why would I need to turn? There are apples at (3,2) and (3,0).\nIf I just keep going DOWN, I will eat them.\n\n**Counter-Argument / Risk Analysis:**\nWhat if the enemy snake #0 moves to block me?\nSnake #0 is at (7,5). It has to cover a lot of distance to get to column 3.\nAt turn 23, it is at (7,5).\nDistance to (3,5) is 4 columns.\nDistance to (3,0) is 5 columns + 5 rows.\nIt's very unlikely to intercept me in column 3 before I get to the bottom.\n\n**The \"T\" on the Map:**\nMap row 6: `T . . . . . T T . .`\nThis shows 'T' at (0,6), (6,6), (7,6).\n(0,6) is my tail (based on list ending in (0,6)).\nThe 'T's at (6,6), (7,6) are likely parts of snake #0? No, snake #0 body is `[(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]`.\nSo (7,6) and (6,6) are indeed snake #0 body.\nRow 5: `. . . . T T T 0 . .`\n(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) are snake #0.\nSnake #0 is stretched out horizontally at y=5/6.\nMy path is at x=3.\nSnake #0 is at x=4..7.\nThere is a gap between me (x=3) and snake #0 (x=4).\nSo I am safe from collision with snake #0 in that column.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGoing DOWN to (3,7) is safe, gets an apple, and sets me up on a clear highway to the bottom where two more apples are waiting.\nIs there any reason NOT to go down?\nIf I go LEFT, I leave the apple at (3,7) for snake #0? Unlikely, it's far.\nBut going DOWN is efficient.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" said \"Moving DOWN is the first step\" towards (0,3). That was a bit misguided because (0,3) is at x=0, and going DOWN at x=3 leaves me at x=3.\nHowever, the column x=3 is a goldmine (apples at 7, 2, 0).\nGoing DOWN is better than LEFT for scoring.\n\nWait, check the \"Last Rationale\" again. It said \"I need 43 more apples... There is an apple at (0,3)\". It then said \"Moving DOWN is the first step\".\nThis logic was flawed for reaching (0,3) but correct for reaching (3,0).\nHowever, I should verify if I can actually reach (3,0).\nThe path is clear. My body length is 8.\nIf I go DOWN repeatedly:\nTurn 23: H(3,7)\nTurn 24: H(3,6)\n...\nTurn 30: H(3,0)\nMy body will fill the column x=3.\nI will be long enough that I might be blocked by my own tail if I turn, but I don't need to turn. I just need to eat the apples in the column.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\nSnake #0 is at (7,5). It moves randomly or strategically.\nIf it goes LEFT, it can try to cut me off.\nBut it is at y=5. If I am at y=7, I have a head start.\nIf I eat at (3,7), I get +1 length.\nNext I go to (3,6). I am one step ahead.\n\nLet's check the \"Game Ends at 50 apples\" and \"Turn 150\".\nI have 7 apples. Snake #0 has 5.\nI need to score fast.\nTaking the guaranteed apple at (3,7) is good.\n\n**Final Check:**\nHead: (3, 8)\nDown: (3, 7) -> Apple.\nIs it safe? Yes, map shows 'A', no snake bodies.\nIs it a trap? No, I can move LEFT or continue DOWN next turn.\nIs there a better move?\nLEFT (2,8) -> Safe, but no apple.\nRIGHT (4,8) -> Safe, no apple.\nUP -> Death.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: Follow the vertical line x=3 down to eat apples at (3,2) and (3,0). Snake #0 is in columns 4-7, so this column is relatively safe.\n\nMove: DOWN.DOWN",

T T T . . . . . .` -> (1,9) to (3,9) are body.\n    - Row 8: `. . . T . . . . . .` -> (3,8) is body.\n    - Row 7: `. . . T . . . A . .` -> (3,7) is body.\n    - Row 6: `. . . T T . . T . 0` -> (3,6), (4,6) are body.\n    - Row 5: `. . . . T . . T T T` -> (4,5) is body.\n    - Row 4: `A . . . 1 . . . T T` -> (4,4) is Head.\n    - Row 3: `A . . . . . . . . .` -> (4,3) is empty.\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (3, 4):\n    - Check (2, 4): Row 4 shows `A . . .`. (2, 4) is the second dot. Empty.\n    - Check (1, 4): Empty.\n    - Check (0, 4): There is an apple there!\n    - However, looking at Row 5: `. . . . T`. (4, 5) is body.\n    - Looking at Row 6: `. . . T T`. (3, 6) and (4, 6) are body.\n    - Looking at Row 7: `. . . T`. (3, 7) is body.\n    - Looking at Row 8: `. . . T`. (3, 8) is body.\n    - Looking at Row 9: `. T T T`. (3, 9) is body.\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe immediately.\n    However, let's consider the space. If I go LEFT, I go towards the wall at x=0. If I go DOWN, I go towards the open bottom.\n    Let's re-evaluate LEFT path safety.\n    (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) is an apple.\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving into a column with a wall at x=0. My body is currently at (3,6)...(3,9). If I go LEFT, I might cut off my own escape route if I turn down later?\n    Actually, the path LEFT is clear. (0,4) is an apple.\n    Let's compare DOWN vs LEFT.\n    DOWN: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0).\n    LEFT: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4).\n    \n    The immediate danger check:\n    UP is body.\n    RIGHT is empty. (5,4) is `.`.\n    Wait, in my previous turn rationale (which was provided in the prompt), I was at (4,5) and moved DOWN. That puts me at (4,4) now.\n    The previous rationale said RIGHT was enemy body. Let's check the current board for RIGHT of (4,4).\n    Row 4: `A . . . 1 . . . T T`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    At index 5 (Right of head): `.`.\n    At index 6: `.`.\n    At index 7: `.`.\n    At index 8: `T`.\n    At index 9: `T`.\n    So (5,4) is empty. (6,4) is empty. (7,4) is empty. (8,4) is Enemy Snake #0 body (based on previous info and board text `T`).\n    So RIGHT is safe for a few steps.\n    \n    Let's look at the Enemy Snake #0:\n    Head: (9,6).\n    Body: (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6).\n    The enemy is moving. We can't predict perfectly, but they are far right.\n    \n    Comparison of options:\n    - DOWN (4,3): Moves towards (3,0) (apple). Open space below.\n    - LEFT (3,4): Moves towards (0,4) (apple). Walls to the left.\n    - RIGHT (5,4): Moves towards nothing specific, eventually (7,4) is blocked by enemy body. (8,4) is enemy body. This puts me on the right side where the enemy is. Not ideal.\n    \n    Between DOWN and LEFT:\n    (4,3) is safe.\n    (3,4) is safe.\n    \n    Let's check lookahead for DOWN.\n    (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0). All empty.\n    From (4,0), I can go to (3,0) (Apple). Then to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0). This is a clear path.\n    \n    Let's check lookahead for LEFT.\n    (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) (Apple).\n    From (0,4), I can go DOWN to (0,3) (Apple) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0). Also clear.\n    \n    Why did the previous turn choose DOWN? The rationale said \"DOWN moves me toward the open bottom of the board and the apples located there\".\n    I am currently at (4,4).\n    \n    Let's look at the board state again.\n    Row 4: `A . . . 1 . . . T T`\n    The `A` at (0,4) is close.\n    \n    However, I need to be careful about getting trapped at the top left (0,9). My tail is currently at (1,9).\n    If I go LEFT to (0,4), I am moving horizontally into the left side.\n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am moving vertically into the bottom side.\n    \n    Consider the enemy. The enemy is at (9,6). If they go Left, they might try to cut me off in the middle. But they are far.\n    Consider my own body. My body occupies the column x=3 from y=6 to y=9. And x=2,1 at y=9.\n    If I go DOWN, I open up the bottom half. I have plenty of space.\n    If I go LEFT, I go into the left half. My body is at x=3...9... wait, my body is at x=3,4 at y=4,5,6... and x=3 at y=7,8,9.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4).\n    Once I am at (0,4), I can go DOWN to (0,3) (Apple), then (0,2), (0,1), (0,0).\n    The issue with LEFT is the wall at x=0. If I am at (0,0), I can only go Right or Up.\n    If I am at (4,0), I can go Left, Right, or Up.\n    (4,0) offers more flexibility than (0,0).\n    \n    Also, looking at the board:\n    Apples at (3,0), (0,3), (3,2), (0,4), (7,7).\n    (3,2) is near (4,0).\n    (0,3) is near (0,4).\n    \n    Let's check the distance to the apples.\n    Current (4,4):\n    - (3,0): Manhattan distance 5.\n    - (0,3): Manhattan distance 5.\n    - (0,4): Manhattan distance 4.\n    - (3,2): Manhattan distance 3.\n    \n    (3,2) is the closest.\n    To reach (3,2):\n    Path 1: Down, Down, Left, Left. (4,4)->(4,3)->(4,2)->(3,2).\n    Path 2: Left, Down, Down. (4,4)->(3,4)->(3,3)->(3,2).\n    \n    Let's evaluate Path 2 (LEFT first):\n    (3,4) is empty.\n    (3,3) is empty? Row 3: `A . . . . . . . . .`. (3,3) is the 4th character. It is `.`. Yes.\n    (3,2) is Apple.\n    \n    Let's evaluate Path 1 (DOWN first):\n    (4,3) is empty.\n    (4,2) is empty? Row 2: `. . . A . . . . . .`. (4,2) is the 5th character. It is `.`. Yes.\n    (3,2) is Apple.\n    \n    Both paths to (3,2) seem viable.\n    \n    However, (3,2) is an apple. But let's look at the board around (3,2).\n    Row 3: `A . . . . . . . . .` (y=3)\n    Row 2: `. . . A . . . . . .` (y=2)\n    Row 1: `. . . . . . . . . .` (y=1)\n    Row 0: `. . . A . . . . . .` (y=0)\n    \n    The left side (x=0) has apples at (0,4), (0,3).\n    The bottom side (y=0) has apples at (3,0).\n    \n    If I go DOWN now:\n    (4,4) -> (4,3).\n    Next turn, I could go DOWN to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3).\n    (5,3) is empty.\n    (5,3) is safe.\n    If I go DOWN twice, I get to (4,2), then (4,1), (4,0). Then I can go LEFT to (3,0) (Apple).\n    (3,0) is an apple.\n    Once I eat (3,0), I am at (3,0). I can go UP to (3,1), (3,2) (Apple), etc.\n    \n    If I go LEFT now:\n    (4,4) -> (3,4).\n    Next turn, I can go DOWN to (3,3), then (3,2) (Apple).\n    Or I can go LEFT to (2,4), (1,4), (0,4) (Apple).\n    \n    The prompt asks for a single move.\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy again. Head (9,6).\n    If the enemy goes DOWN to (9,5) (Body), they die.\n    If they go LEFT to (8,6): Empty? Row 6: `. . . T T . . T . 0`. (8,6) is `T`? No, index 8 is `T`. Wait.\n    Row 6: indices 0-9.\n    0: `.`. 1: `.`. 2: `.`. 3: `T`. 4: `T`. 5: `.`. 6: `.`. 7: `T`. 8: `.`. 9: `0`.\n    Wait, the board says: `. . . T T . . T . 0`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (3,6) and (4,6) are `T` (my body).\n    (7,6) is `T` (my body? No, wait. My body ends at (1,9)).\n    Let's look at Enemy #0 body again: `[(9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]`.\n    So (7,6) is Enemy body.\n    The board at row 6 shows `T` at index 7. Yes, matches Enemy body.\n    The board at row 6 shows `.` at index 8.\n    The board at row 6 shows `0` at index 9 (Enemy Head).\n    \n    So for Enemy at (9,6):\n    - UP (9,7): Row 7: `. . . T . . . A . .`. (9,7) is `.`. Safe.\n    - DOWN (9,5): Enemy body. Unsafe.\n    - LEFT (8,6): Row 6 index 8 is `.`. Safe.\n    - RIGHT (10,6): Off board. Unsafe.\n    \n    Enemy has UP and LEFT options.\n    If Enemy goes UP, it goes to (9,7).\n    If Enemy goes LEFT, it goes to (8,6).\n    \n    I am at (4,4). I am safe from the enemy for a long time.\n    \n    My primary concern is my own body and the walls.\n    My tail is at (1,9).\n    My body snakes: (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9).\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4,3):\n    My new tail will be (1,9) -> (2,9) -> ...\n    My body now occupies (4,4) (new body), (4,5), ...\n    I am opening up the bottom.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (3,4):\n    My body occupies (3,4).\n    My body is now filling x=3 at y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n    This looks like a wall at x=3 for y>=4.\n    If I am at (3,4), I can go DOWN to (3,3). (3,3) is empty.\n    If I am at (3,3), I can go DOWN to (3,2) (Apple).\n    If I am at (3,2), I can go DOWN to (3,1). (3,1) is empty.\n    If I am at (3,1), I can go DOWN to (3,0).\n    \n    So, if I go LEFT, I am effectively moving along a \"column\" (x=3) but moving DOWNwards eventually?\n    Wait, if I go LEFT, I am at (3,4).\n    Next move DOWN -> (3,3).\n    Next move DOWN -> (3,2).\n    This is exactly the same as if I go DOWN first, then LEFT?\n    Path A: DOWN -> (4,3). Next: LEFT -> (3,3). Next: DOWN -> (3,2).\n    Path B: LEFT -> (3,4). Next: DOWN -> (3,3). Next: DOWN -> (3,2).\n    \n    Both paths reach (3,2) in 3 moves.\n    \n    However, look at the space.\n    If I go DOWN first (Path A):\n    I am at (4,3).\n    I have space to my LEFT (3,3) and RIGHT (5,3).\n    I have space BELOW (4,2).\n    \n    If I go LEFT first (Path B):\n    I am at (3,4).\n    My body is at (4,5) and (4,6).\n    To my LEFT is (2,4).\n    To my RIGHT is (4,4) (which will be my body next turn).\n    Wait, if I move to (3,4), my body moves up.\n    Old head (4,4) becomes body.\n    Old body (4,5) becomes next...\n    So, at (3,4):\n    - LEFT (2,4): Empty.\n    - DOWN (3,3): Empty.\n    - UP (3,5): My body (since (4,5) moves to (4,6)? No. The whole body shifts.\n    Let's simulate.\n    Current: Head (4,4). Body: [(4,5), (4,6)...]\n    If I move LEFT to (3,4):\n    New Head: (3,4).\n    New Body: [ (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)... ]\n    So (4,4) is now body.\n    Check (3,5): Empty (Row 5: `. . . . T . . T T T`. (3,5) is index 3, `.`).\n    Check (3,3): Empty.\n    Check (2,4): Empty.\n    Check (4,4): Body.\n    \n    So from (3,4), the safe moves are LEFT, DOWN, UP.\n    From (4,3), the safe moves are LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP (if (4,5) moves away? No, (4,5) is body).\n    Actually, from (4,3):\n    - UP: (4,4) -> becomes body. Unsafe.\n    - DOWN: (4,2) -> Empty.\n    - LEFT: (3,3) -> Empty.\n    - RIGHT: (5,3) -> Empty.\n    \n    So (4,3) has 3 safe moves. (3,4) has 3 safe moves.\n    \n    Let's look at the apples.\n    (3,2) is an apple.\n    (0,4) is an apple.\n    (0,3) is an apple.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I can continue down to (4,0), then Left to (3,0) (Apple). Then I can wrap around to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), then Up to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) (Apple), (0,4) (Apple).\n    This path collects (3,0), (0,3), (0,4).\n    \n    If I go LEFT, I can go to (0,4) (Apple), then Down to (0,3) (Apple), then Down to (0,0), then Right to (1,0)... (3,0) (Apple).\n    This path collects (0,4), (0,3), (3,0).\n    \n    Both are good.\n    \n    Is there a danger of the enemy stealing apples?\n    Enemy is at (9,6). Distance to (7,7) is 2.\n    Enemy is far from my targets.\n    \n    Is there a danger of trapping myself?\n    My tail is at (1,9). It will move as I move.\n    If I go DOWN, my tail moves to (2,9).\n    If I go LEFT, my tail moves to (2,9).\n    No difference yet.\n    \n    Let's look at the board state more carefully.\n    Row 4: `A . . . 1 . . . T T`\n    The `A` is at (0,4).\n    The `T T` at the end are (8,4) and (9,4) which are enemy body.\n    \n    If I go DOWN:\n    (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0).\n    If I go LEFT:\n    (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (0,4).\n    \n    Let's check the cells near the top.\n    My body is at (3,9), (2,9), (1,9).\n    If I go DOWN, I leave the top area. My tail will eventually leave the top row.\n    If I go LEFT, I stay in the middle height. My tail is still at the top.\n    \n    One specific danger:\n    If I go LEFT, I move to x=3. My body is already at x=3 for y=6..9.\n    Moving to (3,4) puts my head \"inside\" the loop of my own body? No.\n    My body path: (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9) -> (2,9) -> (1,9).\n    The column x=3 is occupied from y=6 to y=9.\n    If I move to (3,4), I am at x=3, y=4. This is below the body segment at (3,6).\n    The cell (3,5) is between (3,4) and (3,6). (3,5) is empty.\n    So (3,4) is safe.\n    \n    However, the gap at (3,5) is small (1 cell width).\n    If I move to (3,4), my body becomes: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), ...]\n    Next turn, if I move to (3,3), my body becomes: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), ...]\n    The gap at (3,5) is still there.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"downward\" path.\n    If I go DOWN:\n    (4,3).\n    My body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), ...]\n    This moves me away from the \"loop\" at the top right.\n    \n    I want to access (3,2).\n    From (4,3), I can go LEFT to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2).\n    From (3,4), I can go DOWN to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2).\n    \n    If I go DOWN (4,3), I am one step closer to (4,0). (4,0) is an open space.\n    If I go LEFT (3,4), I am closer to (0,4).\n    \n    Let's look at the apples again: (3,0), (0,3), (0,4), (3,2), (7,7).\n    (3,2) is the closest.\n    To get (3,2):\n    If I go DOWN now: (4,4) -> (4,3).\n    Next turn: (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n    If I go LEFT now: (4,4) -> (3,4).\n    Next turn: (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n    \n    The time to (3,2) is the same.\n    What about (3,0)?\n    From (3,2), (3,0) is 2 moves Down.\n    From (4,0), (3,0) is 1 move Left.\n    \n    If I go DOWN now:\n    (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0).\n    If I go LEFT now:\n    (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0).\n    \n    The time to (3,0) is also the same (5 moves).\n    \n    Okay, let's look at the board layout to decide.\n    The board has an apple at (3,2).\n    There is an apple at (3,0).\n    There are apples at (0,3), (0,4).\n    \n    The space at x=0 is potentially limiting.\n    The space at y=0 is potentially limiting.\n    But I have a long snake (length 9). My tail is at (1,9).\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving towards the wall at x=0.\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving towards the wall at y=0.\n    Both have walls.\n    \n    However, looking at the layout of the *body*:\n    My body occupies a 4x3 block roughly from (3,6) to (4,9).\n    If I go DOWN, I pull my body down. The top part of my body (near y=9) will eventually move down, clearing the top row.\n    If I go LEFT, I move my head into the column x=3. My body is already filling x=3 for y=6..9.\n    \n    Let's imagine I go LEFT to (3,4).\n    Next turn, I can go DOWN to (3,3).\n    Next turn, I can go DOWN to (3,2) (Apple).\n    If I eat the apple, my tail doesn't move.\n    My body becomes: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9)].\n    Wait, if I eat an apple, I grow. The tail stays at (1,9).\n    My body now fills x=3 for y=2 to y=9.\n    That's a solid wall of my own body at x=3 from y=2 to 9.\n    If I am at (3,2), and I want to go Left, I can go to (2,2).\n    If I want to go Right, I can go to (4,2).\n    If I want to go Up, I can't (Body at 3,3).\n    If I want to go Down, I can't (Body at 3,1? No, (3,1) is empty).\n    Wait, (3,1) is empty. (3,0) is apple.\n    So I can go DOWN from (3,2).\n    \n    But imagine if I didn't eat the apple yet.\n    If I am at (3,2) without eating, my body shifts.\n    Head (3,2). Body includes (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)...\n    The gap at (3,1) is open.\n    The gap at (2,2) is open.\n    The gap at (4,2) is open.\n    \n    Now imagine the DOWN path.\n    (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) (Apple).\n    If I eat (3,0):\n    Head (3,0). Body includes (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)...\n    My body now fills x=4 for y=0 to y=5 (roughly).\n    I am at (3,0). I can go Up to (3,1), Left to (2,0), or Right to (4,0) (Body).\n    Left (2,0) is open. Up (3,1) is open.\n    \n    Both paths seem viable.\n    \n    Is there any immediate threat?\n    Enemy at (9,6). Safe distance.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Row 4: `A . . . 1 . . . T T`\n    The `A` at (0,4) is tempting.\n    \n    Let's think about the \"Space\" parameter.\n    If I go LEFT, I am compressing my snake into the left side of the board (x=0 to x=4).\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving to the bottom.\n    My body is currently on the right side (x=4 to x=9).\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I pull my tail from (1,9) downwards. This might take a while to propagate.\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving into the area where my body is NOT (initially).\n    \n    Wait, my body is at (4,4) -> (4,5)... so it is on the right side of the board.\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving into an area with no body (x<4, y<4).\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving into an area with no body (y<4).\n    \n    Let's check the \"trap\" potential.\n    If I go DOWN to (4,3):\n    Next move could be (3,3), (4,2), (5,3).\n    If I go LEFT to (3,4):\n    Next move could be (2,4), (3,3), (3,5).\n    \n    Let's look at the apple (0,4).\n    Distance from (4,4) is 4.\n    Distance from (4,3) is 5.\n    If I go DOWN, (0,4) becomes harder to reach.\n    If I go LEFT, (0,4) becomes easier to reach.\n    \n    Let's look at the apple (3,2).\n    Distance from (4,4) is 3.\n    Distance from (4,3) is 3 (4,3->3,3->3,2) OR (4,3->4,2->3,2).\n    Distance from (3,4) is 2 (3,4->3,3->3,2).\n    \n    LEFT gets me closer to (3,2) and (0,4).\n    DOWN gets me closer to (3,0).\n    \n    Let's check the board state around (0,4).\n    Row 4: `A . . . ...`\n    Row 3: `A . . . ...`\n    Row 2: `. . . A ...`\n    Row 1: `. . . . ...`\n    Row 0: `. . . A ...`\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (0,4), I can eat the apple.\n    Then go DOWN to (0,3) (Apple).\n    Then DOWN to (0,2).\n    Then DOWN to (0,1).\n    Then DOWN to (0,0).\n    Then I can go RIGHT.\n    This seems like a clean sweep of the left edge.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I go to (3,0).\n    Then I can go to (0,3) etc.\n    \n    The difference is:\n    LEFT path: (0,4), (0,3), (0,0), then maybe (3,0).\n    DOWN path: (3,0), (3,2), then maybe (0,3).\n    \n    Let's check the enemy snake's potential moves again.\n    Enemy: (9,6).\n    Options: UP(9,7), LEFT(8,6).\n    (8,6) is empty.\n    If enemy goes LEFT, it moves towards the center.\n    If I go LEFT, I move towards the center.\n    The center is at x=4.5.\n    I am at x=4. Enemy at x=9.\n    I am safe.\n    \n    One detail: My body is at (4,5).\n    If I go DOWN, my body becomes (4,4).\n    If I go LEFT, my body becomes (4,4).\n    \n    Let's look at the board visualization again.\n    `9 .

(7,5) is body. (7,6) is body.\n    Board Row 5: `. . . . T . .

Empty.\n    \n    Both moves are safe.\n    \n    Let's consider the future moves.\n    If I go DOWN to (4,3):\n    Next turn options: (4,2), (3,3), (5,3).\n    If I go LEFT to (3,4):\n    Next turn options: (3,3), (2,4), (3,5).\n    \n    (3,5) is empty.\n    (5,3) is empty.\n    \n    Why did the previous turn choose DOWN?\n    \"DOWN moves me toward the open bottom of the board and the apples located there (e.g., (3, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4)).\"\n    Note: (0, 3) and (0, 4) are NOT down. They are left.\n    The previous rationale might have been slightly confused about the location of (0,3) and (0,4).\n    (0,3) and (0,4) are to the LEFT.\n    (3,0) is DOWN.\n    \n    I am at (4,4).\n    (3,0) is DOWN-LEFT.\n    (0,3) is LEFT-DOWN.\n    (0,4) is LEFT.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I commit to the bottom side.\n    If I go LEFT, I commit to the left side.\n    \n    The apple at (3,0) is on the bottom.\n    The apples at (0,3) and (0,4) are on the left.\n    The apple at (3,2) is in the middle-left.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I can get (3,0) easily. Then I can go LEFT along the bottom to (0,0), then UP to (0,3), (0,4).\n    This path: (4,4) -> (4,3)... -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0)... -> (0,0) -> (0,1)... -> (0,4).\n    \n    If I go LEFT, I can get (0,4) easily. Then DOWN to (0,3). Then DOWN to (0,0). Then RIGHT to (3,0).\n    This path: (4,4) -> (3,4)... -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2)... -> (0,0) -> (1,0)... -> (3,0).\n    \n    The total distance to collect all these apples is similar.\n    \n    However, look at the wall at (0,0).\n    If I go DOWN, I arrive at (3,0). From there, I can turn LEFT.\n    If I go LEFT, I arrive at (0,4). From there, I can turn DOWN.\n    \n    Let's look at the board constraints.\n    My body length is 9.\n    The board is 10x10.\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving into a \"corner\" (bottom-rightish).\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving into a \"corner\" (top-left).\n    \n    The top-left corner (0,9) is where my tail is.\n    If I go LEFT, my tail is at (1,9) -> (2,9) -> (3,9)...\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving my head towards (0,4).\n    My tail is at (1,9).\n    If I fill up the left side (0,4), (0,3)..., and my tail is at (1,9), I might block my own return path if I ever need to go back to the right side.\n    Specifically, if I am at (0,0) and my body fills (0,1) to (0,4) and (1,4) to (1,9), I am trapped in the left column.\n    However, as I move, my tail moves.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"DOWN\" path.\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving my head to the bottom.\n    My tail is at (1,9).\n    It will take many turns for my tail to reach the bottom.\n    I will have plenty of time to clear the left side AFTER eating the bottom apples.\n    \n    If I go LEFT, I am moving my head towards the left.\n    My tail is at (1,9).\n    My body currently snakes around the top right.\n    Moving LEFT might squeeze the space in the top left.\n    \n    Let's check the \"space\" at (3,4).\n    (3,4) is next to (3,5) which is a 1-cell wide gap to my body at (3,6).\n    If I go to (3,4), and then change my mind and want to go RIGHT, (4,4) will be my body.\n    So I can't go RIGHT.\n    I can go DOWN, LEFT, or UP.\n    UP is safe (3,5).\n    LEFT is safe (2,4).\n    DOWN is safe (3,3).\n    \n    Let's check the \"space\" at (4,3).\n    (4,3) is next to (4,4) which will be body.\n    I can't go UP.\n    I can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    \n    So (4,3) has 3 options. (3,4) has 3 options.\n    \n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    (3,2) is an apple.\n    If I go DOWN, I can pivot to (3,2) via (4,3)->(3,3)->(3,2) or (4,3)->(4,2)->(3,2).\n    If I go LEFT, I can pivot to (3,2) via (3,4)->(3,3)->(3,2).\n    \n    Let's look at the \"danger\" of the bottom.\n    (4,0) is safe.\n    (3,0) is apple.\n    (2,0) is empty.\n    (1,0) is empty.\n    (0,0) is empty.\n    I can sweep the bottom row.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"danger\" of the left.\n    (0,4) is apple.\n    (0,3) is apple.\n    (0,2) is empty.\n    (0,1) is empty.\n    (0,0) is empty.\n    I can sweep the left column.\n    \n    One factor: The enemy.\n    The enemy is at (9,6).\n    If the enemy goes LEFT, it comes towards the center.\n    If I go DOWN, I move away from the center (towards y=0).\n    If I go LEFT, I move towards the center (towards x=0).\n    \n    The enemy is at y=6. I am at y=4.\n    If I go DOWN, I go to y=3.\n    If I go LEFT, I stay at y=4.\n    \n    The distance between me and enemy:\n    If I go DOWN: (4,3) to (9,6) is ~8.\n    If I go LEFT: (3,4) to (9,6) is ~8.\n    \n    The apple at (7,7) is very close to enemy. The enemy will likely grab that.\n    The apple at (3,2) is close to me.\n    \n    Let's prioritize (3,2).\n    Path DOWN: 3 moves.\n    Path LEFT: 3 moves.\n    \n    Let's prioritize (0,4).\n    Path DOWN: 4 moves (to (4,3)... then I have to go left).\n    Path LEFT: 1 move.\n    \n    Okay, (0,4) is VERY close if I go LEFT.\n    And (3,2) is reachable quickly either way.\n    \n    Why would I NOT go LEFT?\n    Because of the \"wall\" of my body at x=3 for y=6..9.\n    And the gap at (3,5) is only 1 cell wide.\n    If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am below that gap.\n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am away from that gap.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the board visualization.\n    `9 .

No.\n    (3,1) is empty.\n    (2,2) is empty.\n    (4,2) is empty.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3), then DOWN to (3,2):\n    I will be at (3,2).\n    Same body configuration (roughly).\n    \n    So the choice is: Do I want to be at (3,4) or (4,3) on the next turn?\n    \n    (3,4) puts me closer to (0,4) and (0,3).\n    (4,3) puts me closer to (3,0) and (4,0).\n    \n    There are 2 apples on the left. 1 apple on the bottom (within immediate reach).\n    There is 1 apple at (3,2) which is accessible from both.\n    \n    The apple at (7,7) is contested.\n    The apple at (3,0) is in the bottom right relative to (0,0).\n    The apples at (0,3), (0,4) are in the top left.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I go to the bottom. Then I can sweep the bottom row (0,0) and then go UP the left column.\n    This gets me all apples: (3,0), (3,2), (0,3), (0,4).\n    \n    If I go LEFT, I go to the left. Then I can sweep the left column (0,0) and then go RIGHT along the bottom.\n    This gets me all apples: (0,4), (0,3), (3,2), (3,0).\n    \n    Total distance is similar.\n    \n    However, look at the enemy.\n    Enemy is at (9,6).\n    If I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy.\n    If I go LEFT, I am moving towards the center of the board.\n    \n    The enemy is likely to go LEFT or UP.\n    If the enemy goes UP, it's no threat.\n    If the enemy goes LEFT, it goes to (8,6).\n    From there, it can go to (7,6) (Body), (8,7), (8,5) (Body), or (7,6) is blocked.\n    Wait, (7,6) is Enemy body.\n    So from (8,6), UP (8,7) is empty? Row 7: `. . . T . . . A . .`. (8,7) is `.`. Empty.\n    DOWN (8,5) is Enemy body.\n    LEFT (7,6) is Enemy body.\n    So if Enemy goes LEFT to (8,6), it is trapped.\n    It can only go UP.\n    \n    So the enemy is likely to go UP to (9,7) or LEFT to (8,6) and then UP.\n    \n    My position (4,4) is safe.\n    \n    Let's make a decision based on \"avoiding tight spaces\".\n    (3,4) is next to a wall of my body (x=3 at y=6..9).\n    (4,3) is open to the right and left.\n    (4,3) seems more flexible.\n    (4,3) allows me to go to (5,3) if needed.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am reducing my options for UP, but I gain DOWN.\n    If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am reducing my options for RIGHT, but I gain LEFT.\n    \n    I prefer the open space at the bottom.\n    \n    Let's check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again.\n    It was for the move DOWN from (4,5).\n    That was a good move to avoid the enemy at (5,5).\n    \n    Current state: (4,4).\n    Enemy is at (9,6).\n    \n    I will choose DOWN.\n    Why?\n    1. It moves me towards the bottom wall, which is a safe place to turn.\n    2. It keeps me away from the enemy who is on the right but high up (y=6). I am going down (y=3,2...).\n    3. It allows me to collect (3,0) and then sweep the left side.\n    4. (3,4) is right next to my body at (4,5) and (4,6). (4,3) is not next to any body except (4,4) which I will leave.\n    \n    Wait, if I go DOWN to (4,3), my body becomes (4,4) -> (4,5)...\n    The cells adjacent to (4,3) are:\n    (4,4): My body.\n    (4,2): Empty.\n    (3,3): Empty.\n    (5,3): Empty.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (3,4), my body becomes (4,4) -> (4,5)...\n    The cells adjacent to (3,4) are:\n    (4,4): My body.\n    (3,5): Empty.\n    (2,4): Empty.\n    (3,3): Empty.\n    \n    Both have 3 empty neighbors.\n    \n    Let's look at the Board State grid again.\n    `4 A . . . 1 . . . T T`\n    `3 A . . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), I am at the start of column x=4 below my body.\n    If I go LEFT to (3,4), I am at x=3. My body occupies x=3 for y=6..9.\n    \n    I think (4,3) is slightly safer because it doesn't put my head in the column that my body already occupies.\n    \n    One final check:\n    Is there any apple closer than (3,2) that I missed?\n    No.\n    \n    Is there any immediate danger in DOWN?\n    (4,3) is empty.\n    (4,2) is empty.\n    (4,1) is empty.\n    (4,0) is empty.\n    (3,0) is apple.\n    \n    Is there any immediate danger in LEFT?\n    (3,4) is empty.\n    (3,3) is empty.\n    (3,2) is apple.\n    (3,1) is empty.\n    (3,0) is apple.\n    \n    I'll go DOWN. It feels like spreading out more.\n    \n    **Strategy Update:**\n    Target (3,0). Then (0,0). Then (0,3), (0,4). Then (3,2).\n    \n    Wait, if I go DOWN, I might want to grab (3,2) first?\n    From (4,0), I can go to (3,0) or (2,0).\n    If I am at (4,0), (3,2) is 2 moves away (Up, Up) and 1 Left. Wait, (4,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) is 2 moves.\n    If I am at (3,2), (3,0) is 2 moves Down.\n    \n    I'll stick with the plan: Go DOWN towards (3,0), then sweep left.\n    Actually, if I am going down, I will hit (4,0). Then I can go Left to (3,0). Then I am at (3,0).\n    From (3,0), I can go Up to (3,1), (3,2). That gets the apple at (3,2).\n    Then continue Up to (3,3)... to (3,9) is blocked by my own body?\n    My body at turn 28 is (3,6)...(3,9).\n    If I eat (3,2) at turn ~32, my body will have moved.\n    The segment at (3,9) will likely have moved down or shifted.\n    \n    Let's assume the path: DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN (to 4,0), LEFT (to 3,0 - Apple), UP (to 3,1), UP (to 3,2 - Apple).\n    At this point, my body fills (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), ...\n    (3,3) will be body.\n    Wait, if I go (4,0) -> (3,0), my body shifts to fill (4,0), (4,1), ...\n    If I go (3,0) -> (3,1), my body shifts. (3,0) becomes body.\n    If I go (3,1) -> (3,2), my body shifts. (3,1) becomes body.\n    My body at (3,0) and (3,1) will block my path if I want to go back down.\n    But I don't need to go back down. I want to go LEFT.\n    \n    From (3,2), I can go LEFT to (2,2), then DOWN to (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0).\n    Or I can go DOWN to (3,1), (3,0) (Body).\n    \n    So from (3,2), I must go LEFT or UP or RIGHT.\n    UP: (3,3) might be body.\n    RIGHT: (4,2) might be empty.\n    \n    If I am at (3,2) and I want to get to (0,3), I can go UP? No, (3,3) will be body soon.\n    I should go LEFT from (3,2).\n    (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3).\n    \n    This seems like a valid path.\n    \n    So the plan:\n    1. Go DOWN to (4,3).\n    2. Continue DOWN to (4,0).\n    3. Go LEFT to (3,0) (Apple).\n    4. Go UP to (3,1), (3,2) (Apple).\n    5. Go LEFT to (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3) (Apple).\n    6. Go UP to (0,4) (Apple).\n    \n    This is a solid plan.\n    \n    Let's double check the board for the first move.\n    (4,4) -> (4,3).\n    (4,3) is empty.\n    My body is at (4,5).\n    The enemy is far.\n    This is safe.\n    \n    I will output DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if (0,4) is safe.\n    (0,4) is an apple.\n    If I go to (0,4), I am at the wall.\n    My body will be trailing.\n    The cell (0,5) is empty? Row 5: `. . . . T . . T T T`. (0,5) is `.`.\n    (1,4) is empty? Row 4: `A . . .`. (1,4) is `.`.\n    So (0,4) is safe.\n    \n    I am confident in DOWN.\n    \n    One last check: Is there a risk of head-on collision?\n    My move: DOWN.\n    Enemy move: ?\n    If enemy moves LEFT to (8,6), no collision.\n    If enemy moves UP to (9,7), no collision.\n    If enemy moves somewhere else, no collision.\n    Distance is large.\n    \n    I will write the plan to the \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" tag.\n    Then I will output DOWN.\n    \n    The plan:\n    \"I will move DOWN to (4,3). My goal is to reach the apple at (3,0) by moving down to y=0 and then left. After collecting (3,0), I will move UP to collect (3,2), then LEFT to sweep the left side for (0,3) and (0,4). This avoids the body wall at x=3, y=6..9.\"\n    \n    Wait, the prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    So I should write the plan.\n    \n    The move is DOWN.\n    \n    Let's re-verify (4,3) is empty.\n    Board Row 3: `A . . . . . . . . .`\n    Index 0: (0,3) = `A`\n    Index 1: (1,3) = `.`\n    Index 2: (2,3) = `.`\n    Index 3: (3,3) = `.`\n    Index 4: (4,3) = `.`\n    Yes, empty.\n    \n    Let's re-verify (4,4) is head.\n    Yes.\n    \n    Let's re-verify (4,5) is body.\n    Row 5: `. . . . T . . T T T`\n    Index 4 is `T`. Yes.\n    \n    So UP (4,5) is body. RIGHT (5,4) is empty (Row 4 index 5 is `.`). LEFT (3,4) is empty (Row 4 index 3 is `.`). DOWN (4,3) is empty.\n    \n    Options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    DOWN: Leads to bottom.\n    LEFT: Leads to left wall.\n    RIGHT: Leads to right side (where enemy is).\n    \n    I prefer DOWN over LEFT because it avoids the column x=3 where my body is densely packed above.\n    I prefer DOWN over RIGHT because it avoids the enemy.\n    \n    So, DOWN is the best choice.\n    \n    Final check on the plan string.\n    \"I will move DOWN to (4, 3). My goal is to collect the apples at (3, 0) and (0, 3) by traversing the bottom and left edges. This path avoids my own body in the top-left and the enemy snake on the right.\"\n    This is a good plan.\n    \n    Wait, I need to be careful about the \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" block.\n    The user prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    So I must put the plan in the response.\n    And then the final line is the move.\n    \n    I will write the plan.\n    \n    Plan:\n    I will move DOWN to (4, 3). My goal is to collect the apples at (3, 0) and (0, 3) by traversing the bottom and left edges. This path avoids my own body in the top-left and the enemy snake on the right.\n    \n    Move:\n    DOWN\n    \n    I will double check the coordinates.\n    (4, 4) -> (4, 3) is DOWN.\n    Correct.\n    \n    I will output the plan and the move.\n    \n    One tiny detail:\n    The prompt says \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    DOWN decreases y.\n    UP increases y.\n    So (4, 4) -> (4, 3) is indeed DOWN.\n    \n    I am ready.\n    \n    **START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    I will move DOWN to (4, 3). My goal is to collect the apples at (3, 0) and (0, 3) by traversing the bottom and left edges. This path avoids my own body in the top-left and the enemy snake on the right.\n    **END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    \n    **START MOVE ANALYSIS**\n    My head is at (4, 4).\n    Possible moves:\n    - UP to (4, 5): Occupied by my own body segment. **Unsafe**.\n    - DOWN to (4, 3): Currently empty. This moves towards the bottom of the board and the apple at (3, 0).\n    - LEFT to (3, 4): Currently empty. This moves towards the left wall. However, my body occupies the column x=3 for y=6 to y=9. Moving left puts my head directly below this body column, which can be restrictive.\n    - RIGHT to (5, 4): Currently empty. This moves towards the right side where the enemy snake is located.\n    \n    Choosing DOWN maximizes open space and moves towards the apple at (3, 0) while avoiding the cluster of my own body on the left and the enemy on the right.\n    **END MOVE ANALYSIS**\n    \n    DOWN",

The enemy snake is far away at (7, 7), so immediate head-on collision is not a concern for this turn.\n\nHere is the analysis of my available moves:\n\n1.  **UP** to (4, 2): This cell is currently unoccupied. Moving here is safe and allows me to eat the apple at (4, 2). This is a very strong move.\n2.  **LEFT** to (3, 1): This cell contains an apple at (3, 1). Moving here is safe and I would eat the apple.\n3.  **RIGHT** to (5, 1): This cell is empty. It is a safe move but moves me away from the cluster of apples at the bottom left.\n4.  **DOWN** to (4, 0): This is at the bottom edge (y=0). It is safe and empty, but there are no apples immediately in that direction, and it might limit my movement if I go further down.\n\nComparing **UP** and **LEFT**:\n- Moving **LEFT** to (3, 1) eats an apple immediately.\n- Moving **UP** to (4, 2) eats an apple immediately.\n- However, the board shows a vertical column of apples at (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2). The position (3, 2) is currently blocked by the tail of the snake (indicated by 'T' in the grid map at row 2, col 3). This tail will likely move away next turn (snake ID 1 is at the head (4,1), so the tail at (3,8) is far away, wait, let me re-read the snake info).\n    - My snake ID 1: Head (4,1), Body: [(4,2), (4,3)...]. The tail is at (3,8).\n    - The 'T's on the map correspond to my body. The T at (3,2) on the map corresponds to the end of the body list provided? No, the body list is `[ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8) ]`. Wait, the map shows T at (3,2) and (4,2). The snake info shows `(4,2)` as the first body segment. The map seems to be a visual representation. Let's trust the coordinate list.\n    - The body list ends at `(3,8)`. The map shows 'T' at `(3,8)`.\n    - The map shows 'T' at `(3,2)`. The body list does *not* contain `(3,2)`. There might be a discrepancy between the visual map and the text list, or the map is showing the \"state\" of the board where 'T' denotes any part of *my* snake.\n    - Let's re-verify the body list: `[(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]`.\n    - The cell `(3, 2)` is marked 'A' in the grid (Apple) in the text description, but 'T' in the visual map? Let's look closer at the map:\n      Row 2: `. . . A T . . . . .`\n      Col 3 is 'A'. Col 4 is 'T'. So `(3,2)` is an Apple. `(4,2)` is my body.\n      Row 1: `. . . A 1 . . . . .`\n      My head is at `(4,1)`. `(3,1)` is an Apple.\n      Row 0: `. . . A . . . . .`\n      `(3,0)` is an Apple.\n\n    - Wait, if `(4,2)` is my body, I cannot move UP to `(4,2)`.\n    - Let's check the move history. I moved DOWN last turn. My previous head was at `(4,2)`. My body was at `[(4,3)...]`.\n    - Current Head: `(4,1)`.\n    - Current Body: `[(4,2), (4,3), ...]`.\n    - So `(4,2)` is occupied by my body.\n    - **UP is blocked.**\n    - **LEFT** to `(3,1)` is an Apple. It is empty.\n    - **DOWN** to `(4,0)` is empty (edge of board).\n    - **RIGHT** to `(5,1)` is empty.\n\n    Moving **LEFT** to `(3,1)` allows me to eat an apple. The next turn, I can move to `(3,0)` (Apple) or `(2,1)` or `(3,2)` (Apple).\n    Moving **DOWN** to `(4,0)` is safe but moves me away from the apple cluster at `(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`.\n    Moving **RIGHT** is also away from the apples.\n\n    The best move is **LEFT** to eat the apple at `(3,1)`.\n\nLEFT",

Since I moved there, I have grown by 1 segment. The tail (3, 8) will remain for this turn.\n\n**Move Analysis for Turn 32:**\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   **Status:** **Occupied by an Apple** (Apples list: (3, 2)).\n    *   **Risk:** The cell contains an apple, so it is not an obstacle. It is empty of body segments.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe. I will eat the apple at (3, 2). This is a greedy move towards a cluster of apples ((3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)). This move aligns with the long-term strategy of eating the vertical column of apples.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):**\n    *   **Status:** **Occupied by an Apple** (Apples list: (3, 0)).\n    *   **Risk:** Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe. I would eat the apple at (3, 0). However, this moves me to the bottom edge (y=0), which might restrict future movement compared to moving UP into the center of the board.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty.\n    *   **Risk:** Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves me away from the dense apple cluster at (3, 2) and (3, 0). Less optimal if apples are the priority.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   **Status:** **Occupied by my Body** (segment at (4, 1)).\n    *   **Risk:** Collision with self.\n    *   **Outcome:** **DEATH**. Cannot move here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to (3, 2) allows me to eat an apple and positions me to potentially eat the apple at (3, 3) or (3, 0) next, depending on board state. It keeps me away from the edges. Given the confirmation that I am at (3, 1) and have eaten the apple there, moving UP to eat the next apple at (3, 2) is the most logical and profitable safe move.\n\nUP",

This is a valid target.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 1):** Empty.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 2):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Occupied by my body at (2, 2). **Invalid.**\n\n2.  **Enemy & Threat Assessment:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (5, 5). It is not an immediate threat.\n    *   **Moving UP to (1, 3):** This eats an apple. The cells to the North of (1, 3) are (1, 4) [Empty], (1, 5) [Empty], etc. This keeps paths open.\n    *   **Moving LEFT to (0, 2):** This is safe. It leads to apples at (0, 3) and (0, 4). However, this moves away from the apple at (1, 3).\n    *   **Moving DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Leads to an apple at (3, 0) eventually, but (1, 3) is closer.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    *   **UP** is the immediate high-value move. It scores a point and grows my snake.\n    *   **LEFT** is a safe alternative if I wanted to avoid the apple for some reason, but eating is usually advantageous.\n    *   **DOWN** is also safe but moves away from the nearest apple cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT** is invalid.\n\n    **Constraint Check:** My previous move was **LEFT** to get to (1, 2). My tail is at (3, 6). Moving UP is strictly valid as (1, 3) is empty in the current state (before the move).\n\n    **Strategy:**\n    Prioritize eating the apple at (1, 3) to increase score and grow. This maintains a southern approach to the board, keeping the western wall as a potential boundary while staying mobile.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to eat the apple at (1, 3). After eating, assess the path towards (0, 3) and (0, 4).\n\nUP",

I need to consider if I can beat it to them.\n\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5)**:\n    *   Moves me across the board towards the left side.\n    *   Gets me closer to the cluster of apples at (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (3, 0).\n    *   This is a direct path towards the apples, but it moves me into a more confined space on the left side of the board.\n    *   The enemy snake is at (1, 2) and could also move towards the left side. I need to consider the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5)**:\n    *   Moves me towards the right side of the board.\n    *   There are no apples on the right side.\n    *   This move doesn't bring me closer to any apples and could potentially lead me into a dead-end.\n    *   This is the least appealing option.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1's possible moves:**\n\nFrom (1, 2), the enemy snake can move:\n*   **UP to (1, 3)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n*   **DOWN to (1, 1)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n*   **LEFT to (0, 2)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2)** - **DEATH!** Hits its own body at (2, 2).\n\nSo the enemy snake has three safe options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n\n*   The enemy snake is closer to the bottom-left apple cluster than I am. If it moves DOWN to (1, 1) next turn, it could be in a good position to reach the apples at (3, 0) or (0, 3).\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 5), I'll be moving towards the same area as the enemy snake. This could lead to a head-on collision if both of us are targeting the same apple.\n*   Moving DOWN to (5, 4) gives me more room to maneuver and allows me to observe the enemy snake's next move before committing to a direction. I can then decide whether to continue towards the bottom-left apples or explore other options.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI believe the best move is to go **DOWN** to (5, 4). This keeps my options open and allows me to position myself better for the next few turns without immediately committing to a path that could lead to a head-on collision with the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

It opens up paths to the right (towards the apple at (9, 4)) or keeps the center open. However, moving UP moves away from the closest apples at (0, 3) and (0, 4).\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3):** Contains an Apple.

It immediately collects an apple, increasing the score to 12. It also positions the head directly below another apple at (0, 4), creating a clear path for the next turn. While moving against a wall reduces some flexibility, the reward of two guaranteed apples (0,3 and 0,4) outweighs the initial risk, especially since the body length allows for maneuvering.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nCollect the apple at (0, 3) now. Next turn, move UP to collect the apple at (0, 4). After collecting both western apples, re-evaluate the board to determine the safest path back towards the center or the southern apple at (3, 0).\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 3):** Outside the board. **Invalid.**\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 3):** Occupied by my body (segment at (1, 3)). **Invalid.**\n\n2.  **Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (5, 3)):**\n    *   Snake #0 is currently at (5, 3). Its possible moves are:\n        *   UP (5, 4): Occupied by its own body. **Fatal.**\n        *   DOWN (5, 2): Empty. **Safe.**\n        *   LEFT (4, 3): Occupied by my body. **Fatal.**\n        *   RIGHT (6, 3): Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   Since Snake #0 wants to survive, it will likely move DOWN or RIGHT.\n    *   If it moves DOWN to (5, 2), it poses no threat to me.\n    *   If it moves RIGHT to (6, 3), it moves further away.\n    *   There is no immediate head-on collision threat for my valid moves.\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (0, 4):** Contains an Apple. This guarantees a score increase to 13. It also moves me further away from the board edge (which can be dangerous if the snake grows long and needs to turn around). From (0, 4), I can move further UP (but that goes into empty space away from other apples) or turn RIGHT to (1, 4).\n    *   **DOWN (0, 2):** Empty. This would move me back towards the bottom of the board where there is an apple at (3, 0). However, (0, 2) is directly to the left of my body segment (1, 2), which could be a risky tight spot later.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move **UP** to (0, 4) is the optimal choice. It collects the second apple in this column (guaranteeing 13 points), keeps the snake's head away from the immediate edge (allowing for easier movement next turn), and maintains a clear path to eventually move right towards the center of the board.\n\n**Strategy:**\nCollect the apple at (0, 4) now. After that, evaluate moving RIGHT to (1, 4) to begin transitioning out of the corner and towards the center apples.\nEND RATIONALE\n\nUP",

Now I need to evaluate which one is the best.\n\n**Evaluation of safe options:**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 4)**:\n    *   This is the same position I just moved from. It's safe, but it doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n    *   It also moves me back towards the center of the board, which could be risky if the enemy snake is also moving towards the center.\n\n*   **DOWN to (5, 2)**:\n    *   This moves me towards the bottom of the board.\n    *   It gets me closer to the apple cluster on the left/bottom side.\n    *   However, it also moves me closer to the enemy snake's general area.\n\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3)**:\n    *   This moves me towards the left side of the board.\n    *   It gets me closer to the cluster of apples at (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (3, 0).\n    *   This is a direct path towards the apples, but it moves me into a more confined space on the left side of the board.\n    *   The enemy snake is at (1, 2) and could also move towards the left side. I need to consider the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3)**:\n    *   This moves me towards the right side of the board.\n    *   There are no apples on the right side.\n    *   This move doesn't bring me closer to any apples and could potentially lead me into a dead-end.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1's possible moves:**\n\nFrom (0, 3), the enemy snake can move:\n*   **UP to (0, 4)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n*   **DOWN to (0, 2)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 3)** - **DEATH!** (off the board)\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 3)** - **OKAY** (empty cell)\n\nSo the enemy snake has three safe options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n\n*   The enemy snake is at (0, 3), which is very close to the apple at (0, 4). If it moves UP to (0, 4) next turn, it will eat that apple.\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 3), I'll be moving towards the same area as the enemy snake. This could lead to a head-on collision if both of us are targeting the same apple.\n*   Moving DOWN to (5, 2) gives me more room to maneuver and allows me to observe the enemy snake's next move before committing to a direction. I can then decide whether to continue towards the bottom-left apples or explore other options.\n*   Moving UP to (5, 4) is safe but not very strategic, as it doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI believe the best move is to go **LEFT** to (4, 3). This gets me closer to the apple cluster on the left side of the board, and it gives me a good chance to reach the apple at (3, 0) before the enemy snake can get there. I need to be careful of the enemy snake's next move, but this seems like the most strategic option.\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**",
