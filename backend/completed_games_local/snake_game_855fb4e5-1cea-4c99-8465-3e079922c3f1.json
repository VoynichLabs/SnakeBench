I need to find a safe initial move that puts me in a good position to collect apples.\n\nMy head is at $H_1 = (5, 2)$.\nThe enemy head is at $H_0 = (1, 3)$.\n\nApples are at: (6, 0), (3, 7), (0, 4), (6, 7), (8, 6), (4, 4), (4, 9), (3, 9), (9, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 3), (8, 7), (0, 3).\n\nI will evaluate the four possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP to (5, 3):**\n   - New position: (5, 3).\n   - Safe? (5, 3) is on the board. No body segments yet. Safe from self-collision.\n   - Collision risk with Snake 0? Snake 0 is at (1, 3). If Snake 0 moves, it could potentially collide if it targets (5, 3), but this is highly unlikely from (1, 3) in one turn.\n   - Apple? Yes, (5, 3) has an apple. This is an immediate gain.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 1):**\n   - New position: (5, 1).\n   - Safe? (5, 1) is on the board. Safe.\n   - Apple? No apple.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n   - New position: (4, 2).\n   - Safe? (4, 2) is on the board. Safe.\n   - Apple? No apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n   - New position: (6, 2).\n   - Safe? (6, 2) is on the board. Safe.\n   - Apple? No apple.\n\nThe move UP to (5, 3) immediately collects an apple and moves me towards the center/upper part of the board where many other apples are clustered (e.g., (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)).\n\nSince there are no immediate threats (no walls, no body segments, and the enemy is far away), the primary goal is to maximize apple collection while maintaining safety. Moving UP accomplishes this best.\n\nPredicted next state if I move UP:\nHead at (5, 3). Length 2. Apple count 1.\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nUP",

Moving LEFT to (0, 3) will collect an apple on this turn and increase my length to 2. This position also places my head adjacent to another apple at (0, 4), which I can collect on the following turn by moving UP. This sequence (LEFT then UP) efficiently gathers 2 points and keeps me near the safe edge of the board, away from the enemy's likely path.\n\nPlan:\nCollect the apple at (0, 3) by moving LEFT. On the next turn, move UP to collect the apple at (0, 4). Afterward, navigate towards the center or top-left to find the next nearest apples, such as the one at (4, 4) or (3, 7).\n\nLEFT",

Snake 0 is far away on the left side of the board.\n\n**Nearest Apples to $H_1=(5, 3)$ (Manhattan distance):**\n1.  (5, 5): Distance $|5-5| + |5-3| = 2$. (UP, UP) or (UP, LEFT/RIGHT)\n2.

(5, 5) seems centrally located and is directly UP from the current position.\n\n**Evaluating Possible Moves from (5, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, on board (10x10). Not hitting own body.\n    *   Apple? No, (5, 4) is empty.\n    *   Next access point: This path leads directly to (5, 5) next turn (if Snake 0 is not targeting it).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   Deadly self-collision. (5, 2) is the segment immediately trailing the head (the neck). **KILL MOVE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, on board. Not hitting own body.\n    *   Apple? No, (4, 3) is empty.\n    *   Next access point: Leads towards (4, 4) or (4, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, on board. Not hitting own body.\n    *   Apple? No, (6, 3) is empty.\n    *   Next access point: Leads towards (6, 4).\n\n**Enemy Snake 0 (0, 3):**\nSnake 0 is likely moving to eat (0, 4) or avoid the wall/my territory.\nPossible moves for Snake 0: (0, 4) UP (apple!), (1, 2) DOWN, (-1, 3) LEFT (death), (1, 3) RIGHT (self-body collision, death). Given its body is (1, 3), if it moves RIGHT, it hits (1, 3) and dies. If it moves DOWN to (0, 2), it's safe. If it moves UP to (0, 4), it eats an apple. The most rational move for Snake 0 is UP to (0, 4).\n\nGiven Snake 0 is far away, collision risk is negligible.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have three safe and viable directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All lead to apples two moves away.\n\n*   UP (5, 4) -> (5, 5) (Apple)\n*   RIGHT (6, 3) -> (6, 4) (Apple) or (7, 3)\n*   LEFT (4, 3) -> (4, 4) (Apple) or (3, 3)\n\nMoving UP to (5, 4) is the most central move towards a dense cluster of apples ((5, 5), (6, 5), (4, 5)).\n\nLet's check the subsequent move options from (5, 4):\n*   From (5, 4): UP (to (5, 5), apple), LEFT (to (4, 4), apple, or 4, 5, apple), RIGHT (to (6, 4), apple).\n(5, 4) offers immediate access to three high-value cells next turn. This is the best strategic position.\n\nI choose UP.\n\nUP",

I need to select the best move for Snake 1.\n\n**Current Game State (Turn 2):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: $H_1 = (5, 4)$\n    *   Body: $B_1 = [(5, 3)]$\n    *   Length: 2 segments.\n    *   Apples collected: 1.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: $H_0 = (0, 4)$\n    *   Body: $B_0 = [(0, 3), (1, 3)]$ (Note: based on the board, Snake 0 must have moved UP from (0, 3) to (0, 4) this turn, and the apple at (0, 4) was present in Turn 1's apple list, but is not present in the board state description for Turn 2. Wait, the board state visualization *shows* '0' at (0, 4). Let's re-examine the previous move rationale. Snake 0 was at (0, 3) with body (1, 3) in Turn 1. If it moved UP to (0, 4), and there was an apple there, it would have eaten it. The scores show Snake 0 has 2 apples. It likely ate (0, 4) in the last turn. The depiction of '0' at (0, 4) is the head. The body segments are at (0, 3) and (1, 3).\n*   **Apples Remaining:** (6, 0), (3, 7), (6, 7), (8, 6), (4, 4), (4, 9), (3, 9), (9, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (8, 7), (4, 5), (4, 8), (6, 1). A total of 15 apples.\n\n**Obstacle Check (Self-Collision and Wall):**\nThe body of Snake 1 is only 1 segment long, $B_1 = [(5, 3)]$.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? Yes, (5, 5) is an apple (A).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   Deadly self-collision. (5, 3) is the neck segment. **KILL MOVE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? Yes, (4, 4) is an apple (A).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? Yes, (6, 4) is an apple (A).\n\nAll three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) lead directly to an apple. This is an ideal situation. I must choose the move that sets me up best for future turns, anticipating Snake 0's movements. Snake 0 is far away at (0, 4).\n\n**Evaluating Apple Choices:**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   Eats apple, length 3.\n    *   Positions the head centrally, right next to (4, 5) and (6, 5) (both apples). Also close to (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 7), (3, 9), (6, 7). This keeps options open by moving into the densest area of apples.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   Eats apple, length 3.\n    *   Positions the head near the left flank of the apple cluster ((4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9)). Good, but slightly less central than (5, 5).\n\n3.  **Move RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   Eats apple, length 3.\n    *   Positions the head near the right flank of the apple cluster ((6, 5), (6, 7)). Good, but slightly less central than (5, 5).\n\nSince (5, 5) is surrounded by several subsequent apples (4, 5), (6, 5), and is a gateway to the upper apples (4, 8, 4, 9, 3, 9), moving UP seems strategically the strongest choice for maximizing access to future apples.\n\n**Anticipating Snake 0 Movement (Head at (0, 4), Body at (0, 3), (1, 3)):**\nSnake 0 must move to (0, 5) [UP], (1, 4) [RIGHT], or (0, 3) [DOWN].\n*   DOWN to (0, 3) is a self-collision (neck). **KILL MOVE.**\n*   RIGHT to (1, 4): Safe, moves away from the wall.\n*   UP to (0, 5): Safe, continues up the wall.\n\nSince there are apples at (4, 9) and (3, 9), Snake 0 will likely continue moving UP or move RIGHT to seek apples. (0, 5) or (1, 4) are the likely outcomes. Neither poses a threat to my chosen path, which is primarily focused on the middle-upper part of the board.\n\nI choose UP to eat the apple at (5, 5).\n\nUP",

Instead, I will move UP along the left edge (x=0) to safely bypass the central conflict zone. My goal is to secure the cluster of uncontested apples in the top-left quadrant, specifically targeting (3, 7), (4, 8), and (4, 9).\n\n**Move Explanation**\n1.  **Safety**: Moving **UP** to (0, 5) is perfectly safe. It avoids moving into row 4, where the enemy head is located, preventing any potential head-on collision scenarios if the enemy moves left aggressively. Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 4) would place me on a direct line with the enemy snake, which is risky.\n2.  **Positioning**: The enemy is well-positioned to consume the central apples (4, 4), (6, 4), (5, 5). By moving **UP**, I position myself closer to a separate cluster of apples in the upper rows (y=7, 8, 9) which the enemy cannot reach as quickly.\n3.  **Flexibility**: This move keeps my body straight along the wall, avoiding self-trapping, and allows me to cut inwards at a higher row to claim territory that is currently open.\n\nUP",

DOWN is fatal.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT lead to immediate apples. UP leads to an empty space (5, 6), though it is very close to two apples (A at (6, 7), A at (8, 7)).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Eats an apple. Length becomes 4.\n    *   Positions the head centrally on the left side of the current cluster.\n    *   Next potential apples: (4, 4) (A), (4, 8) (A), (4, 9) (A). Good access.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Eats an apple. Length becomes 4.\n    *   Positions the head centrally on the right side of the current cluster.\n    *   Next potential apples: (6, 4) (A), (6, 7) (A). Good access.\n*   **Move UP to (5, 6):**\n    *   Does NOT eat an apple. Length remains 3.\n    *   This is generally a weak move given the availability of multiple apples, unless it's necessary to avoid a trap or collision. It is not necessary here.\n\n**3. Comparison and Strategy:**\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are excellent options. We need to look ahead to see which offers better future potential or avoids potential conflict with Snake 0.\n\n*   **Apples nearby:** (4, 5), (6, 5), (4, 4), (6, 4), (4, 8), (4, 9), (6, 7), (3, 7), (3, 9). This area is extremely dense.\n*   **Snake 0 Position:** (0, 5), moving along the Y-axis. It is likely heading toward (0, 6) [Apple A] or (1, 5) [Right]. Since (0, 6) is an apple, Snake 0 will likely take it. If Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 6), it lengthens to 4. Subsequent apples (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 9) are appealing to Snake 0.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5):\n*   I can follow up with (4, 4) [A] or UP to (4, 6) or (4, 8) [A]. This path emphasizes the 4-column apples, which are relatively close to Snake 0's potential targets (3, 7), (3, 9).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 5):\n*   I can follow up with (6, 4) [A] or UP to (6, 6) or (6, 7) [A]. This path emphasizes the 6-column apples, keeping me further away from Snake 0's likely upper-left migration path.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 5) seems slightly safer as it moves me away from the area Snake 0 is approaching (columns 0, 1, 2, 3) and allows me to secure the cluster of apples around column 6 and 8.\n\nLet's confirm no head-on collision based on possible moves for Snake 0 (H0 at (0, 5)):\n1.  UP to (0, 6) [A]: Safest move for S0.\n2.  RIGHT to (1, 5): Safe.\n3.  DOWN to (0, 4): Kill move (neck).\n*   If S0 moves UP to (0, 6), my move (6, 5) is perfectly safe.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT to (1, 5), my move (6, 5) is perfectly safe.\n\nThe choice between LEFT and RIGHT is minor, but RIGHT to (6, 5) offers a slightly better guarantee of sequential unchallenged apple consumption in the (6, 7, 8) columns, while the (4, 3) columns are potentially contested by Snake 0 later.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT is fatal.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\nThe immediate target is DOWN to (6, 4), which is an apple.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   Eats an apple. Length becomes 5.\n    *   Positions the snake well to continue consuming the central/right cluster: (7, 4) [A], (6, 1) [A], (6, 0) [A].\n*   **Move UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   Does NOT eat an apple. Length remains 4.\n    *   Leads directly toward (6, 7) [A] and (8, 7) [A]. Good move, but less optimal than eating an apple now.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Does NOT eat an apple. Length remains 4.\n    *   Leads toward (8, 6) [A] or (7, 4) [A]. Also a good path, but eating now is better.\n\n**3. Strategy and Conflict Check:**\n\nThe optimal move is clearly DOWN to secure the apple at (6, 4).\n\nWe must check for potential lethal interactions with Snake 0 (Head at (0, 6)). Snake 0 is far away and currently focused on the top left.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (H0 at (0, 6)):\n1. UP to (0, 7): Safe.\n2. RIGHT to (1, 6): Safe.\n3. DOWN to (0, 5): Kill move (neck).\n\nSince Snake 0 is 6 columns away from my potential targets, and my move is DOWN to (6, 4), there is no risk of collision this turn, regardless of Snake 0's move.\n\nTaking the immediate apple at (6, 4) is the best choice for scoring and growth.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T5)**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6, 4) (eating an apple), the next cluster includes (7, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 0). Also (8, 6) is accessible via (7, 5) or (8, 5). The next move should prioritize (7, 4) or start heading toward the bottom (6, 1), (6, 0). Given the central location, heading to (7, 4) (RIGHT) seems the most flexible path, keeping the option of going up toward (8, 6) or down toward (6, 0) open.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT is fatal as it hits the neck (6, 4).\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves based on Apple Proximity:**\n\nWe are currently at (7, 4). We want to move toward the dense cluster of apples, specifically:\n*   (8, 6) - Distance 3\n*   (8, 7) - Distance 4\n*   (7, 6) - Distance 2\n*   (6, 7) - Distance 3\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 5):**\n    *   Puts us at distance 1 from (7, 6) [A], distance 2 from (8, 6) [A], and distance 3 from (8, 7) [A].\n    *   Next potential move: UP to (7, 6) (EAT) or RIGHT to (8, 5).\n    *   (7, 6) is an apple! This provides an immediate scoring opportunity on Turn 7.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 3):**\n    *   Moves away from the primary apple cluster.\n    *   Puts us closer to (9, 3) [A] (distance 2 via RIGHT).\n    *   Puts us closer to (6, 1) [A] (distance 3 via LEFT, DOWN).\n    *   This is a less favorable direction right now.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n    *   Puts us at distance 2 from (8, 6) [A] or (9, 3) [A].\n    *   Next potential move: UP to (8, 5) or RIGHT to (9, 4).\n    *   This is a good, but slightly less direct path to the dense central cluster than UP.\n\n**3. Selecting the Best Move (UP):**\n\nMoving UP to (7, 5) grants the quickest access to an apple: (7, 6) is only 1 move away.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake 0 Consideration (Head at (0, 8)):**\nSnake 0 is focused on the top left. Possible moves for $H_0$:\n1. UP to (0, 9): Safe. (Proximity to (4, 9), (3, 9)).\n2. RIGHT to (1, 8): EATS Apple (1, 8). This is highly likely.\n3. DOWN to (0, 7): Hits body/neck. DANGER.\nSnake 0 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (1, 8) to eat the apple. This poses zero threat to Snake 1 at (7, 4).\n\nThe move UP to (7, 5) is safe and maximizes the immediate apple potential for Turn 7.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T7)**\nIf I move UP to (7, 5):\n*   Head $H_1 = (7, 5)$.\n*   Turn 7: Move UP to (7, 6) to eat the apple.\n*   Head $H_1 = (7, 6)$ (Length 7).\n*   From (7, 6), I have access to (8, 6) [A] (1 move RIGHT) and (6, 7) [A] (2 moves LEFT, UP). Also, (8, 7) [A] is 1 move UP and 1 move RIGHT. This puts me in a strong position in the central-right cluster.\n\nUP",

This top-down approach keeps my body along the board edge, maximizing central space for maneuvering and reducing the risk of being trapped by the enemy or my own tail.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n1.  **Immediate Reward**: Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 8) collects an apple this turn, increasing my score and length immediately.\n2.  **Safety**: The target cell is empty and safe. Snake #1 is too far away (at 7, 4) to pose a threat or compete for this apple.\n3.  **Positioning**: This move places the snake in column 1 with multiple open neighbors ((1, 9), (2, 8), (1, 7)), allowing flexibility.

Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT eat an apple. Both are excellent moves.\n\n*   **UP to (8, 7):** EATS an apple. Next to (9, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 6):** EATS an apple. This places the head right on the board edge.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n1. **Move UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   Ate apple (8, 7).\n    *   Next potential target: (9, 6) (1 move RIGHT) or (6, 7) (2 moves LEFT/DOWN).\n    *   Keeps separation from the X=9 boundary.\n2. **Move RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   Ate apple (9, 6).\n    *   Next potential target: (9, 3) (3 moves DOWN) or (8, 7) (1 move LEFT, 1 move UP - wait, 8,7 will be gone). (9, 3) (3 moves DOWN).\n    *   Places head in the corner/edge, potentially limiting future moves slightly, although (9, 6) is an apple.\n\n(8, 7) is a slightly more central location for continued movement towards the remaining apples in the 6-9 column area: (9, 3), (9, 2). Since both are instantly beneficial, I'll choose UP because it keeps the snake slightly away from the far eastern wall, allowing for easier access down the wall later if needed, and (9, 6) will still be available the next turn if desired (unless Snake 0 is coming, but Snake 0 is far away).\n\nLet's check Snake 0 movement:\n$H_0 = (2, 9)$. Snake 0 is likely aiming for (3, 9) or (4, 9).\nPossible moves for $H_0$:\n1. UP to (2, 10): Off-board. DANGER.\n2. DOWN to (2, 8): Eats the apple (2, 8). This is highly likely.\n3. LEFT to (1, 9): Hits neck/body. DANGER.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 9): Eats the apple (3, 9). This is also highly likely.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9), it does not impact my current decision, which is focused on the right side of the board.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nMove UP to (8, 7) to collect the apple and position for further moves.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T10)**\nIf I move UP to (8, 7) (Length 9).\nThe next closest apples are (6, 7) (2 moves away) or (9, 6) (1 move away - likely will be gone if I chose UP). Wait, (9, 6) is 1 move RIGHT, 1 move DOWN. If I move UP, (9, 6) is 1 move RIGHT from (8, 7), then 1 move DOWN. Wait, (9, 6) is 1 move RIGHT, 1 move DOWN from (8, 7)? No.\n$H_1=(8, 7)$. Target (9, 6). Move RIGHT to (9, 7), then DOWN to (9, 6) (EAT). Two moves.\nTarget (6, 7). Move LEFT to (7, 7), then LEFT to (6, 7) (EAT). Two moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 6) (Length 9).\n$H_1=(9, 6)$. Next closest apple is (9, 3) (3 moves DOWN).\n\nSince I am currently very long (8 segments), getting trapped near the side wall (9, 6) is less ideal than (8, 7). (8, 7) gives me more freedom.\n\nLet's stick with UP.\n\n**T10 Strategy:** Move RIGHT to (9, 7), then DOWN to (9, 6) (Eat), or investigate (6, 7).\n\nUP",

The board is getting crowded with snake bodies.\n\n**1. Obstacle Identification & Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 7)):**\n\n*   **Self-Body Locations (Fatal if moved into):** $B_1 = \\{(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)\\}$.

Snake 0 is far away on the left side.\n*   **Board boundaries:** $0 \\le X, Y \\le 9$.\n\n| Direction | Target Cell | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision? | Apple (A)? | Safety |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 8) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| DOWN | (8, 6) | No | Yes (Neck/Body) | No | No | DANGER |\n| LEFT | (7, 7) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| RIGHT | (9, 7) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n\nAll moves except DOWN are safe.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\nCurrent $H_1 = (8, 7)$.\n\n*   **Closest Appetizing Targets:**\n    1. (9, 6): 2 moves (RIGHT to (9, 7), then DOWN to (9, 6)).\n    2. (6, 7): 2 moves (LEFT to (7, 7), then LEFT to (6, 7)).\n    3. (4, 8) or (4, 9) or (3, 9): 4+ moves.\n\n*   **UP to (8, 8):** Puts me right below the top wall (Y=9). Good for traversing the top edge, but slightly away from the immediate apples (9, 6) and (6, 7).\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** Puts me one step closer to apple (6, 7). This move also starts bringing me towards the center/left half of the board where Snake 0 is, perhaps for competitive reasons, but less immediately lucrative than the right side apples.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Puts me adjacent to the right wall (X=9) and one move away from apple (9, 6). This looks like an optimal move to secure the next apple quickly.\n\n**3. Move Comparison (RIGHT vs LEFT):**\n\n*   We need to collect (9, 6) and (6, 7).\n*   **Moving RIGHT to (9, 7):** Secures (9, 6) on T11 (1 move away).\n*   **Moving LEFT to (7, 7):** Secures (6, 7) on T11 (1 move away).\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of immediate reward proximity. Let's look at the density of apples nearby.\n\n*   If I go RIGHT and get (9, 6) (T11), the next closest apples are (9, 3) (3 moves away), (9, 2) (4 moves away), or (6, 7) (4 moves away).\n*   If I go LEFT and get (6, 7) (T11), the next closest apples are (3, 7) (3 moves away), or (9, 6) (3 moves away).\n\nThe cluster of apples (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 2) on the right edge suggests leaning into the right side might yield slightly more reliable returns, especially since Snake 0 is busy on the far left (around (2, 8), likely heading to (3, 9) or (4, 9)).\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (9, 7), I secure the right edge.\n\n**4. Check for Future Traps/Collisions:**\n\n$H_1=(9, 7)$.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT/DOWN, it remains far. If Snake 0 moves RIGHT, it is still only at $H_0=(3, 8)$ or $H_0=(3, 7)$, posing no current threat.\n\nThe path RIGHT to (9, 7) then DOWN to (9, 6) is very safe regarding my own body structure, as the body is mostly clustered around (6, 4) to (8, 6).\n\nI will prioritize securing the apple (9, 6) next turn.\n\n**5. Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T11)**\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 7) (Length 9).\nNext turn, move DOWN to (9, 6) to eat the apple (Length 10).\nThen likely move DOWN towards (9, 3) and (9, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

This specific order is critical because ending the sequence at (3, 9) would trap the snake in a dead-end, whereas ending at (4, 8) leaves multiple escape routes.

This sequence efficiently gathers three apples in four moves.

This move positions the snake to consume the apple at (3, 9) on the next turn and initiates the planned multi-apple collection sequence. Moving Right to (4, 7) is inferior because approaching the cluster from that direction would likely force the snake to end the sequence at (3, 9), which will be a tight dead-end surrounded by my own body.

Evaluating Safe Moves based on Plan and immediate apples:**\n\nThe previous long-term plan (T15 rationale) was:\nT16: Move LEFT to (8, 2) [The logic seems flawed in the T15 rationale, as moving from (9, 2) LEFT is (8, 2). However, I was at (9, 3) and moved LEFT to (8, 3). The current plan should be adjusted from (8, 3)].\n\nMy goal is to reach the apples near the bottom edge: (9, 2), (8, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0).\n\n*   Current location: (8, 3).\n*   Nearest apple: (9, 2) (1 step E and 1 step S, but E is fatal), or (5, 2) (3 steps W, 1 step S), or (8, 0) (3 steps S).\n\n**A. Move UP to (8, 4):** Moves away from the bottom apples. (8, 4) is clear.\n**B. Move DOWN to (8, 2):** This moves towards (8, 0) and potentially (9, 2) later. (8, 2) is clear.\n**C. Move LEFT to (7, 3):** This moves towards the center of the board. (7, 3) is clear.\n\nThe optimal vector seems to be heading towards the bottom-left corner to collect (8, 0), (6, 1), and (6, 0).\n\n1. If I move **DOWN to (8, 2)**:\n   * Next turn (T17), I can move DOWN to (8, 1), then DOWN to (8, 0) (EATING). (3 total steps).\n2. If I move **LEFT to (7, 3)**:\n   * I would need to weave down and left. This is less direct.\n\nMoving DOWN appears to be the best continuation of the bottom-edge sweeping strategy.\n\n**3. Head-on Collision Check:**\n$H_1=(8, 3)$. $H_0=(5, 9)$. They are vastly separated.\n\n**4. Tentative Future Plan Update:**\nT16: Move DOWN to (8, 2).\nT17: Move DOWN to (8, 1).\nT18: Move DOWN to (8, 0) (Eat apple).\nT19: Move LEFT to (7, 0).\nT20: Move LEFT to (6, 0) (Eat apple).\n\nThis sequence prioritizes eating two apples in the next four turns.\n\n**5. Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T17 onwards)**\nT17: Move DOWN to (8, 1).\nT18: Move DOWN to (8, 0) (Eat apple).\nThen proceed left along the bottom to target (6, 0) or (6, 1).\n\nDOWN",

If I move LEFT, I'm at (8, 1). To reach (8, 0), I'd then need to move DOWN.\n\n(9, 1) -> DOWN -> (9, 0) -> LEFT -> (8, 0) (Apple) (2 moves)\n(9, 1) -> LEFT -> (8, 1) -> DOWN -> (8, 0) (Apple) (2 moves)\n\nBoth paths take 2 moves to reach the (8, 0) apple.\n\n**3. Choosing the Best Path (Local Exploration):**\n\nLet's look ahead one more turn, assuming Snake 0 remains far away (which it is, concentrated in the top middle/left).\n\n*   **If I choose DOWN to (9, 0):** This keeps my snake along the bottom edge, making the subsequent pathing to (8, 0) and (6, 0) straightforward (moving LEFT).\n    *   T20 potential move: LEFT to (8, 0) (Apple). Safe, as my body is currently clustered near X=9 and Y > 1.\n*   **If I choose LEFT to (8, 1):** This puts me one square higher than the desired path along the bottom edge. While possible, (9, 0) feels like a more committed path to clearing the bottom row.\n\nI will follow the plan established in the last turn's rationale: move DOWN to (9, 0).\n\n**4. External Threats:**\nSnake 0 is at (4, 7). No interaction expected.\n\n**5. Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T20 onwards)**\nT20: Move LEFT to (8, 0) (Eat apple).\nT21: Move LEFT to (7, 0).

This means Snake 0 did not eat an apple, but it must have moved, so its body length should remain 11 unless the game is adding one segment automatically per turn or my interpretation of the body list length vs actual body length is off. Usually, the body list includes the tail. L=Head+Body. My snake L=13. Body list B1 has 12 segments. Head at (8, 0). Total length is 13. Snake 0 L=12. Body list B0 has 11 segments. Head at (4, 5).

Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 0):** This moves me directly towards the next target apple (6, 0). This continues the strategy of clearing the bottom edge, which is currently free of the enemy snake.\n*   **Move UP to (8, 1):** This moves me away from the closest apple (6, 0) and puts me closer to my own body segments (9, 1) and (8, 2).

Possible moves for H0:\n*   (4, 4) [Apple]\n*   (4, 6) [Neck/Body] -> Death if (4,6) is part of their body list. (4, 6) is the neck, so this is backwards movement and immediate death for H0.\n*   (3, 5) [Apple]\n*   (5, 5)\n\nThe enemy is far away and poses no immediate threat to my intended path (LEFT along Y=0).\n\n**4. Optimized Move Selection:**\nMoving LEFT towards (6, 0) is the best option for gathering apples efficiently and maintaining control of the board edge.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T22 onwards)**\nT22: Head is at (7, 0). Target (6, 0). Move LEFT to (6, 0) (Eat apple).\nT23: Head is at (6, 0). Target (0, 0).

Evaluating Safe Moves based on Apple proximity and Pathing:**\n\nMy current goal is to target the cluster of apples around column 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   Distance to (5, 2): 1 step (UP).\n    *   Distance to (5, 3): 2 steps.\n    *   This is the optimal move to follow up on the planned path towards (5, 2) and (5, 3).\n*   **Move UP to (6, 2):**\n    *   Moves away from (5, 2) and (5, 3).\n    *   Next move would likely be LEFT to (5, 2) (2 steps total), which is slower than moving LEFT then UP (2 steps total for (5, 2), but from (5, 1) I am positioned better).\n    *   If I move UP, I still have to maneuver around my body segment at (6, 0).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   Moves away from the column 5 apples. The closest apple is (7, 2) (1 step). This is a good alternative target.\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs RIGHT:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 1):** Targets (5, 2) (1 step) and (5, 3) (2 steps). This path maintains control over the center-bottom of the board.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Targets (7, 2) (1 step). This is an immediate apple grab opportunity, similar to how I planned for (5, 2).\n\nLet's check the distance/safety for both immediate strikes:\n\n*   **Option A: Target (5, 2).** Move LEFT to (5, 1). H1 is now (5, 1). Next turn, move UP to (5, 2) (Apple). Total 2 turns.\n*   **Option B: Target (7, 2).** Move RIGHT to (7, 1). H1 is now (7, 1). Next turn, move UP to (7, 2) (Apple). Total 2 turns.\n\nBoth are 2-turn apple grabs. Let's look at the surrounding area and length constraints.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 1):\n*   T24 Head at (7, 1).\n*   T25 Target (7, 2) (Apple).\n*   The area around (7, 2) is open. This seems safer as it doesn't immediately approach the winding curves of my body at (8, 2), (9, 2), etc., though it is near the long vertical segment of the enemy snake's former path (9, 0) through (9, 7). Wait, my body already covers $X=9$ almost completely.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1):\n*   T24 Head at (5, 1).\n*   T25 Target (5, 2) (Apple).\n*   This path brings me towards the enemy Snake 0, whose head (4, 4) is relatively close.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis (H0 at (4, 4)):**\n\nEnemy $H_0$ is at (4, 4). Neck is (3, 4).\nSafe moves for H0: UP (4, 5) [Death by body], DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4) [Death by body], RIGHT (5, 4).\nWait, $B_0 = [(3, 4), (3, 5), \\dots]$. The neck is (3, 4).\nSafe moves for H0 (4, 4):\n*   UP to (4, 5): **Collision with B0!** (4, 5) is part of enemy body. DANGER.\n*   DOWN to (4, 3): SAFE. Gets closer to apples (2, 2), (5, 2).\n*   LEFT to (3, 4): **Collision with B0 (Neck)!** DANGER.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 4): SAFE. Gets closer to apples (5, 2), (5, 3).\n\nThe enemy is likely to move DOWN to (4, 3) or RIGHT to (5, 4).\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (5, 4), it positions itself well for apples (5, 2) and (5, 3).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1), and H0 moves RIGHT to (5, 4):\n*   I am at (5, 1). Next, I move to (5, 2).\n*   H0 is at (5, 4). Next, H0 moves to (5, 3) or (6, 4).\n\nIf H0 goes for (5, 3), we might intersect at (5, 3) in T25 or T26.\n\nIf I choose the RIGHT path (target (7, 2)), it minimizes interaction with H0, which is currently focused on the middle left area (4, X).\n\n**4. Optimized Move Selection:**\n\nGiven that H0 is likely to contest the column 5 apples, and I have an equivalent 2-turn apple grab opportunity at (7, 2) via RIGHT to (7, 1), choosing to move RIGHT seems strategically better to avoid potential conflicts and maintain distance/options. The area around (7, 2) is less congested by my existing body/tail path (which loops around 8, X and 9, X).\n\nTarget (7, 2).\nT24: Move RIGHT to (7, 1). Safe.\nT25: Move UP to (7, 2) (Apple grab).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I step into the path where H0 wants to go, increasing conflict risk for only a marginal navigational advantage (both are 2-turn grabs).\n\nI select RIGHT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T25 onwards)**\nT25: Head will be at (7, 1) (Length 15). Target (7, 2). Move UP to (7, 2) (Apple).\nT26: Head will be at (7, 2) (Length 16). Target (6, 7) or (7, 9). Likely move UP to (7, 3), then possibly LEFT/UP towards (6, 7). Or maybe turn attention back to (5, 2) if H0 hasn't taken it.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 2):** This secures an apple. Length increases. This is the primary objective.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 1):** This is safe but moves one step away from the immediate apple (7, 2). It positions me near the long occupied column X=8, 9.\n\n**3. Secondary Check: Enemy Snake 0 Movement (H0 at (4, 3))**\n\nEnemy Neck: (4, 4).\nApples close to H0: (5, 2), (5, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1).\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_0$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | My Collision? | Apple (A)? | Danger to self? |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (4, 4) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | No | DANGER |\n| DOWN | (4, 2) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| LEFT | (3, 3) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| RIGHT | (5, 3) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE (Apple) |\n\nH0 is likely to prioritize RIGHT to (5, 3) (apple) or maybe DOWN or LEFT to reposition for the cluster of apples around X=2, Y=1, 2.\n\nWe are at (7, 1), and H0 is at (4, 3). The distance is significant. Even if I move UP to (7, 2), I am safe from H0. H0 cannot reach (7, 2) this turn.\n\n**4. Move Decision:**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 2) is safe, results in eating an apple, and fulfills the plan from the previous turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T26 onwards)**\nT26: Head will be at (7, 2) (Length 16). Apples at (6, 7), (7, 9). We should continue moving generally North to grab (7, 9).\nPossible moves from (7, 2): UP to (7, 3), DOWN (bad, towards tail), LEFT to (6, 2), RIGHT to (8, 2).\n(8, 2) is part of my body, so RIGHT is DANGER.\nI must move UP to (7, 3) or LEFT to (6, 2).\nIf I move UP to (7, 3), I target (7, 9) or (6, 7).\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), I could go towards (5, 2) or (5, 3) if H0 hasn't taken them.\nLet's aim UP towards (7, 9) and (6, 7) to clear the top right quadrant first, as H0 seems focused on the left middle.\n\nUP",

After securing (5, 2), I plan to move UP through (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6). This path collects a total of 4 apples in a vertical line and utilizes my body to block the enemy (snake #1) from accessing the center of the board, forcing them to the right edge where apples are scarce. The apples on the West side are far from the enemy and can be collected later.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP (4, 4)**: Immediate death (backwards collision with own neck).\n- **LEFT (3, 3)**: Safe, but moves away from the contested central apple cluster and allows the enemy to potentially claim column 5.\n- **RIGHT (5, 3)**: Collects an apple immediately, but leaves the southern apple at (5, 2) exposed to the enemy. Given the score is tight (13 vs 14), securing more contested apples is better. Moving RIGHT also complicates the subsequent path North compared to starting from the bottom.\n- **DOWN (4, 2)**: The optimal move. It is safe and places my head one step away from the apple at (5, 2). I can reach (5, 2) faster than the enemy, claiming it. The subsequent sequence of moves (RIGHT, UP, UP...) is protected by my own body and forces the enemy into a parallel path on column 6 with fewer scoring opportunities.\n\nDOWN",

This move serves two purposes: it secures a point to narrow the score gap (14 vs 15) and denies this central apple to the enemy. Although my previous plan was to continue UP column 5, re-evaluation shows that path leads to a dead-end trapped by my own body segments at rows 7 and 8. Therefore, after capturing (5, 2), I plan to execute a \"hook\" based escape: I will move **DOWN** to (5, 1), then **LEFT** underneath my body towards the western side of the board. The west side (columns 0-3) contains a rich cluster of uncontested apples which I can harvest safely, while the enemy is forced to scavenge the sparse eastern edge.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP (4, 3)**: Immediate death (moves backwards into my own neck).\n- **LEFT (3, 2)**: A safe move that leads towards the western apple cluster. However, it concedes the apple at (5, 2) to the enemy, allowing them to score and gain better positioning.\n- **DOWN (4, 1)**: Safe, but inefficient. It delays reaching the western apples compared to going Left, and fails to capture the reachable apple at (5, 2).\n- **RIGHT (5, 2)**: The optimal move. It captures an apple this turn. While it places me adjacent to the enemy's potential location, the geometry of the board ensures a safe escape path next turn (DOWN to (5, 1)), which simply isn't available to the enemy. This maximizes my score without incurring significant risk.\n\nRIGHT",

Looking at $B_1$: it ends at (9, 6). The cells around (6, 2) are (7, 2) (neck), (6, 1), (7, 1). Ah, let's look at the given board state:\nRow 2: . A A . T 0 . T T T\n(6, 2) is marked 'T'. This 'T' denotes a segment of Snake #1 (the only visible 'T's are mine, since Snake #0 is shown as 'T' in the map description, but '0' in its head location).\nLet's confirm my body:\n$B_1 = [(7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]$.\n(6, 2) is NOT in $B_1$.

Since the head (5, 2) belongs to Snake 0, let's scrutinize $B_0$:\n$B_0 = [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]$.\n(6, 2) is NOT in $B_0$.\n\nLet's re-examine the provided board state snippet carefully for the \"T\" at (6, 2):\n 2 .

(15 apples total)\n\n**1. Obstacle Identification & Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 4)):**\n\n*   Neck: (7, 3).\n*   My current target zone is the top right: (7, 9), (9, 8), (6, 7).\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision? | Apple (A)? | Safety |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 5) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| DOWN | (7, 3) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | No | DANGER |\n| LEFT | (6, 4) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| RIGHT | (8, 4) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves in relation to Apples and Enemy:**\n\n*   **Apples Distances (Manhattan to (7, 4)):**\n    *   (7, 9): d=5 (Directly UP)\n    *   (9, 8): d=6 (2 R, 4 U)\n    *   (6, 7): d=4 (1 L, 3 U)\n    *   (5, 6): d=4 (2 L, 2 U)\n    *   (5, 5): d=3 (2 L, 1 U)\n    *   (5, 3): d=3 (2 L, 1 D) (Enemy might get this)\n    *   (2, 2) / (1, 2): d=7/7 (Far Southwest cluster)\n\nThe optimal route remains aiming for the top right/center (7, 9) and (6, 7).\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 5):** This is the most direct path to (7, 9) (d=4 from (7, 5)) and also keeps options open for (6, 7) and (5, 6). Safe and efficient.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 4):** This is the path toward (9, 8) (d=5 from (8, 4)). Also safe. If I go RIGHT, the path to the NW cluster ((6, 7), (5, 6)) becomes slightly longer.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 4):** This moves closer to the center, targeting (5, 5) (d=2 from (6, 4)) or (6, 7) (d=3 from (6, 4)). This path brings me closer to where the enemy will operate.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake 0 Movement Prediction (H0 at (5, 1)):**\n\nEnemy Neck: (5, 2).\nApples close to H0: (5, 3) (2 U - 1 move if it goes UP, 0 U if it moves UP), (5, 5), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2).\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_0$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | My Collision? | Apple (A)? | Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (5, 2) | No | Yes (Neck - $B_0$ start) | No | No | DANGER |\n| DOWN | (5, 0) | No | No | No | No | Safe |\n| LEFT | (4, 1) | No | No | No | No | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (6, 1) | No | No | No | No | Safe |\n\nWait, I need to re-verify $B_0$ segmentation geometry. The head moves *relative* to the neck's position *before* the move.\n$H_0 = (5, 1)$. Neck $N_0 = (5, 2)$.\n\n*   UP to (5, 2): Head hits historical neck position. DANGER.\n*   DOWN to (5, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (4, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 1): Safe. (Note: (6, 1) is adjacent to my body segment (6, 1), but since my tail moves away, it's safe unless I move into it. The cell (6, 1) is currently occupied by segment $B_1[4]$. If I move away from this area, the tail may clear).\n\nThe closest apple to H0 is (5, 3). To reach (5, 3), H0 must first move to (5, 2), which is its neck and thus suicidal.\nSo H0 must move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\nIf H0 goes DOWN to (5, 0), it moves toward (3, 0) (d=2) or (0, 0) (d=5).\nIf H0 goes LEFT to (4, 1), it moves toward the SW cluster ((1, 1), (2, 1)).\nIf H0 goes RIGHT to (6, 1), it moves close to my body, possibly toward (8, 1).\n\nSince (5, 3) is unreachable this turn, H0 is likely aiming for another nearby apple or repositioning. The SW cluster is appealing. A move LEFT to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 1) seems most plausible for positioning.\n\nMy position at (7, 4) is relatively far from H0, minimizing immediate collision risk. I should stick to my plan of moving into the top right, away from the enemy.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are excellent safe moves.\n*   UP (7, 5) targets the highest-value apple (7, 9) and maintains central pressure on the 7-column.\n*   RIGHT (8, 4) targets (9, 8) and puts me near the right wall.\n\nSince (7, 9) is on my current column, UP is the most direct approach to maximize apple acquisition efficiency and quickly secure the top right quadrant.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T29 onwards)**\nMove UP towards (7, 9). Secure (7, 9), (9, 8), and then pivot towards (6, 7). This keeps me clear of Snake 0 who is currently focused on the lower/central part of the board.\n\nUP",

Once inside this protected zone, I have free reign to collect the cluster of apples at (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2) without interference.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **LEFT (4, 1)**: The optimal move.

Evaluating Safe Moves in relation to Apples and Enemy:**\n\nMy primary goal remains securing the apples in the top half of the board, especially (7, 9) and (9, 8).\n\n*   **Apples Distances (Manhattan to (7, 5)):**\n    *   (7, 9): d=4 (Directly UP) *Primary Target*\n    *   (9, 8): d=5 (2 R, 3 U)\n    *   (6, 7): d=3 (1 L, 2 U)\n    *   (5, 6): d=3 (2 L, 1 U)\n    *   (5, 5): d=2 (2 L, 0 U) *Closest Apple*\n    *   (5, 3): d=4 (2 L, 2 D)\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 6):** Advances directly towards (7, 9) (d=3). Very strong, keeps the right side open.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 5):** Reaches the immediate proximity of (5, 5) (d=1 away). Also gets closer to (6, 7) (d=2 away) and (5, 6) (d=2 away). This is highly appealing as it secures the closest apple and opens up options in the NW quadrant.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 5):** Moves away from the NW cluster, towards the right wall. Targets (9, 8) (d=4 away) and (8, 1) (d=5 away). This is a good maneuvering move, but less direct to an apple than LEFT or UP.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake 0 Movement Prediction (H0 at (4, 1)):**\n\nEnemy Neck: (5, 1).\nApples close to H0: (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 3), (3, 0), (0, 0).\nThe enemy head (4, 1) is adjacent to its neck (5, 1) to the RIGHT.\nSafe moves for H0: UP (4, 2) - Collision with body segment (4, 2)! DANGER. DOWN (4, 0). LEFT (3, 1). RIGHT (5, 1) - Collision with neck! DANGER.\n\nLet's re-examine $B_0$: [(5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), ...].\n$H_0 = (4, 1)$.\n*   UP to (4, 2): Cell (4, 2) is segment $B_0[2]$. DEATH.\n*   DOWN to (4, 0): Safe. Targets (3, 0) (d=1). This is likely.\n*   LEFT to (3, 1): Safe. Targets (2, 1) (d=1). This is also likely.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 1): Cell (5, 1) is segment $B_0[0]$, the NECK. DEATH (moving backwards).\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained. It must go DOWN to (4, 0) or LEFT to (3, 1).\nIf H0 goes LEFT to (3, 1), it is directly targeting apple (2, 1). If successful, it will also be close to (1, 1) and (1, 2).\nIf H0 goes DOWN to (4, 0), it is directly targeting apple (3, 0).\n\nSince H0 is focused on the bottom row, I am safe continuing my high-priority apple collection at the top/center.\n\n**4. Final Decision - Comparing UP and LEFT:**\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 5):** Gets me to the nearest apple (5, 5) in 2 moves (turn 31). It also positions me perfectly for (6, 7) or (5, 6).\n    *   T30: (6, 5)\n    *   T31: (5, 5) (EAT)\n*   **UP (7, 6):** Advances toward the high-up apple (7, 9).\n    *   T30: (7, 6)\n    *   T31: (7, 7)\n    *   T32: (7, 8)\n    *   T33: (7, 9) (EAT) (4 moves total)\n\nAcquiring (5, 5) is faster and secures points before Snake 0 can swing wide to interfere. Although (7, 9) is a good location for growth, securing the closer cluster (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7) first seems more point-efficient in the short term.\n\nMove LEFT to (6, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T30 onwards):**\nMove LEFT to (6, 5). If (5, 5) is clear, move to (5, 5). Reassess after that, likely aiming for (5, 6) or (6, 7) to clear the central-west cluster and then proceed towards (7, 9) and (9, 8).\n\nLEFT",

By moving **DOWN** to (4, 0), I extend my vertical body wall along column 4 downward, effectively sealing off the western area (x \u2264 3) from the enemy. This \"sanctuary\" contains a rich cluster of apples which I can then graze safely. My immediate path will be to sweep left along the bottom wall to collect apples at (3, 0) and (0, 0), then zigzag upwards to consume the cluster at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **DOWN (4, 0)**: This move is safe (cell is empty) and strategic. It positions my head adjacent to the apple at (3, 0) for the next turn. By filling the cell at (4, 0), I eliminate a potential gap in my defense and ensure that I efficiently utilize the board edge, preventing the creation of awkward empty \"islands\" later. It commits me to a safe, apple-rich path along the bottom row.\n- **LEFT (3, 1)**: Also a safe move, but leaving (4, 0) empty while moving into the center of the potential \"room\" is slightly less space-efficient for a snake. Moving DOWN maintains a disciplined perimeter traversal.\n- **UP** and **RIGHT**: Lead immediately into body segments (my own at (4, 2) and (5, 1) respectively), resulting in death.\n\nDOWN",

This is empty space, but leads towards a cluster of apples. (4, 5) is surrounded by enemy body parts: (4, 4) below, (4, 6) above. This might feel slightly constrictive, though safe for now.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake 0 Movement Prediction (H0 at (3, 0)):**\n\nEnemy Neck: (4, 0).\nThe enemy ate the apple at (3, 0). Available apples nearby: (0, 0) (d=3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2).\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_0$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision? | Apple (A)? | Safety |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (3, 1) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| DOWN | (3, -1) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEATH (Wall) |\n| LEFT | (2, 0) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| RIGHT | (4, 0) | No | Yes (Neck B0[0]) | No | No | DANGER |\n\nSnake 0 is likely to move UP to (3, 1) to navigate around the cluster of apples at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2). Moving LEFT to (2, 0) is also viable to get to (0, 0), but (3, 1) provides access to the cluster of fruit in the (1,2) area. Let's assume UP or LEFT.\n\n*   If $H_0$ moves UP to (3, 1): No conflict.\n*   If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (2, 0): No conflict.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nMoving UP to (5, 6) is an immediate apple grab and keeps me central to other rich apple locations like (6, 7), (7, 9), and (9, 8). This is the clear best choice.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T32 onwards):**\nAfter eating (5, 6), the head $H_1$ will be at (5, 6). The next immediate apple is (6, 7) (1 step right/up). I should move RIGHT next to (6, 6) or UP/RIGHT towards (6, 7) or (7, 9). Given the proximity of (6, 7), moving RIGHT towards it seems logical, unless constrained.\nIf I move UP to (5, 7) next, I can target (7, 9) or (2, 8) or swing left to (1, 7).\n\nLet's stick to the immediate plan: grab (5, 6).\n\nUP",

I must eliminate LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves (UP vs RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 6):** Immediate apple grab. $H'_1 = (6, 6)$. This is highly beneficial.\n*   **Move UP to (5, 7):** Empty space. The closest apples are (6, 7) (1 step right/up) or (7, 9) (2 steps up/right). This moves me further from (6, 7), which is right next door.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) is the optimal choice as it secures another apple immediately and sets me up close to (6, 7) on the next turn.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake 0 Movement Prediction (H0 at (2, 0)):**\n\nEnemy Neck: (3, 0).\nNearby apples: (0, 0) (d=2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2).\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_0$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision? | Apple (A)? | Safety |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (2, 1) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE (Apple) |\n| DOWN | (2, -1) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEATH (Wall) |\n| LEFT | (1, 0) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| RIGHT | (3, 0) | No | Yes (Neck B0[0]) | No | No | DANGER |\n\nSnake 0 is definitely going to move UP to (2, 1) or LEFT to (1, 0) (targeting (0, 0)). Since (2, 1) is an apple and immediately accessible, UP is the most likely move.\n\n*   If $H_0$ moves UP to (2, 1): No conflict with $H_1$ moving RIGHT to (6, 6).\n*   If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (1, 0): No conflict.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nThe move RIGHT to (6, 6) is an immediate apple grab, maintains my leading score, and keeps me in an area with many apples ((6, 7), (7, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7)).\n\nRIGHT",

The immediate plan is to collect the corner apple at (0,0) via (1,0). Afterwards, I will move UP to (0,1) and sweep Row 1 rightwards to collect (1,1) and (2,1). I will then check if I can safely clear the corridor at x=3 (entering at (3,1) and exiting at (3,2)) before sweeping Row 2 leftwards to collect (2,2) and (1,2). This systematic approach maximizes apple collection while ensuring no space is wasted and exit routes remain open.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **LEFT (1, 0)**:\n  - **Safety**: The cell (1,0) is empty and safe. My body at x=4 blocks the enemy from reaching this area.\n  - **Strategy**: This move positions the head to collect the apple at (0,0) on the next turn. Collecting the corner apple first is essential for an efficient space-filling path (boustrophedon pattern) that covers the 5 apples currently clustered in this lower-left region.\n  - **Alternatives**: UP (2,1) is safe and collects an apple immediately, but it starts the path away from the corner (0,0). Doing so would require backtracking later, which risks leaving gaps or trapping the head. LEFT prioritizes the corner and orderly space filling.\n\nLEFT",

Leads toward a more congested path around the central enemy body mass, though (3, 6) and (2, 8) are reachable.\n*   Move RIGHT to (7, 7): Puts me in a direct line for (7, 9) (2 steps) or (9, 7) (3 steps).\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n1.  **UP (6, 8):** Distance to (7, 9) is Manhattan D=3 (R, U). Distance to (9, 8) is D=3 (R, R).\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 7):** Distance to (7, 9) is D=2 (U, U). Distance to (9, 7) is D=2 (R, R).\n\nRIGHT seems slightly more flexible and immediately focuses on the high-value corner apples. (7, 9) is perfectly aligned UP from (7, 7).\n\nLet's check for proximity to the enemy snake (ID 0) and potential trapping. Since Snake 0 is far away at (0, 0) and is moving towards the bottom-left corner and lower-middle apples, there is virtually no risk of collision or interference this turn.\n\n**3.

Goal: Apples and Positioning**\n\n$H_1$ is at (7, 7). The nearest high-value apples are:\n*   (7, 9): 2 steps (UP, UP)\n*   (9, 8): 3 steps (R, U, R or R, R, U)\n*   (9, 7): 2 steps (R, R) - this is on the path if I go RIGHT.\n*   (3, 6): 5 steps (L, D, L, L, D)\n\nI am optimally positioned to capture the top-right cluster.\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 8):** Clears the path to (7, 9) (next turn: UP to eat it). This is the fastest route to an apple.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 6):** This moves me away from the top-right cluster. It is a safe move but not goal-oriented currently.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 7):** This moves me toward (9, 7) (1 step away), and also positions me well for (9, 8). (9, 7) is a guaranteed apple capture two turns from now if I don't go UP first.\n\n**Comparison of UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):**\n    *   Next turn: UP to (7, 9) (Apple).\n    *   Total turns to first apple: 2 (UP, UP).\n    *   This is the fastest, most direct path to an immediate apple.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n    *   Next turn: RIGHT to (9, 7) (Apple).\n    *   Total turns to first apple: 2 (R, R).\n    *   This is also a fast, direct path to an immediate apple.\n\nBoth moves offer an apple in 2 turns. (7, 9) is slightly higher priority as it further secures the top boundary.\n\nLet's check the position after eating (7, 9) vs (9, 7).\n\n*   If I go UP, I eat (7, 9). Head is then at (7, 9). I can then turn RIGHT towards (9, 8) or DOWN/RIGHT toward (9, 7).\n*   If I go RIGHT, I eat (9, 7). Head is then at (9, 7). I can then turn UP toward (9, 8) or L/U toward (7, 9).\n\nSince both moves are equally effective in securing an apple in two turns, I should prioritize the one that keeps me most flexible afterward, or the one that is marginally safer/better positioned.\n\n(7, 9) is on the very edge of the board. (9, 7) is also on the edge. Going to (7, 9) allows me to maintain a central-right position, still close to (9, 8). Going to (9, 7) commits me to the vertical edge.\n\nI choose **UP** to capture (7, 9) because it opens up the path to (9, 8) and maintains a flexible position relative to the rest of the board.\n\n**Enemy Status Check:**\nEnemy $H_0$ is at (0, 1). Snake 0 is focused on the bottom-left quadrant. No immediate danger of collision.\n\n**3. Decision:** Move UP toward the (7, 9) apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nPrioritize clearing out the high-density apple cluster in the top-right (7, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7). Then proceed to the next nearest clusters (e.g., (2, 8), (3, 6) or down the right side to (9, 4)).\n\nUP",

Afterwards, I will push UP along the left wall to collect the apple at (0,3) and continue towards the upper apples (0,6), (1,7). Speed is essential to claim the upper-left apples before Snake 1 crosses over from the right side.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **RIGHT**:\n  - **Immediate Gain**: Moves to (1,1) and collects an apple immediately.\n  - **Safety**: Valid move into a safe square; no adjacent enemy threats.\n  - **Tactics**: Initiates the planned counter-clockwise sweep. Starting with UP (to 0,2) would either reduce efficiency or risk trapping the snake if the sweep ended at (1,1).\n  - **Goal**: Secure the 4-apple cluster efficiently and prepare to move northward.\n\nRIGHT",

Checking the state: (0, 1) was $H_0$ last turn, (1, 1) is $H_0$ now. They moved RIGHT. They must have eaten the apple at (1, 1) if it existed, or maybe they just moved. Let's re-verify: Last turn apples included (1, 1). Snake 0's apples increased from 16 to 17. So Snake 0 moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1) and ate an apple.\n    *   Enemy Body Obstacles: [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. (Length 17, but the list provided is length 17, and the head is (1, 1). This implies their length is 18. The tail should be (4, 7).

Goal: Capture Nearest Apple**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 9) is an immediate apple capture. This aligns perfectly with the plan to clear the top-right cluster.\n$A_1 = (7, 9)$. Distance = 1 (UP).\n\n**3. Comparison of Safe Moves**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 9):** Instant apple capture. Excellent outcome. New head position (7, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Moves towards other high-priority apples (9, 8) (2 steps away) and (9, 7) (3 steps away), but delays the immediate capture.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):** Moves away from the high-density cluster. Not optimal unless avoiding a trap, which isn't the case here.\n\n**4. Enemy Head Prediction/Head-on Collision**\n\n$H_1$ moves to (7, 9).\n$H_0$ is at (1, 1). The enemy is far away and focused on the bottom-left corner. We are in no danger of collision with $H_0$.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nThe move UP to (7, 9) is the cleanest, safest, and highest-reward action.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating (7, 9), $H_1$ will be at (7, 9). The next targets are (9, 8) and (9, 7). (9, 8) is 3 steps away (R, R, D or R, D, R, etc.). (9, 7) is 3 steps away (R, D, R). Given the narrow space at the top, moving RIGHT is the best general direction after eating.\n\n**If $H_1$ is at (7, 9):**\n*   RIGHT to (8, 9)\n*   From (8, 9): RIGHT to (9, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8). (9, 9) is off-board. So from (8, 9), we must go DOWN.\n*   From (8, 9), DOWN to (8, 8).\n*   From (8, 8), RIGHT to (9, 8) (Apple).\nThis takes 3 turns: UP (current), RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT. Total 4 turns to get (9, 8).\n\nWait, $H_1$ is currently at (7, 8).\n1. Current Move: UP to (7, 9). (Eat apple).\n2. Next Move (from 7, 9): RIGHT to (8, 9). (Cannot go UP, cannot go back DOWN).\n3. Next Move (from 8, 9): DOWN to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 9) (Body collision) or RIGHT to (9, 9) (Off-board). Wait, (9, 9) is off-board? No, 9, 9 is the corner.\n   * From (8, 9), RIGHT to (9, 9). This is safe.\n4. Next Move (from 9, 9): DOWN to (9, 8) (Apple).\n\nRevised plan: 1. UP (to 7, 9, apple). 2. RIGHT (to 8, 9). 3. RIGHT (to 9, 9). 4. DOWN (to 9, 8, apple). This is 4 turns for 2 apples.\n\nAlternatively, from (7, 9):\n1. UP (to 7, 9, apple).\n2. RIGHT (to 8, 9).\n3. DOWN (to 8, 8).\n4. RIGHT (to 9, 8, apple).\n\nBoth paths lead to (9, 8) in 3 subsequent moves. The second path (via (8, 8)) seems safer as it avoids boxing myself into the (9, 9) corner with no movement options except DOWN/LEFT. Let's stick to the immediate move.\n\nUP",

Evaluating Safe Moves**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** This moves towards the target apples (9, 8) and (9, 7).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, $H'_1 = (8, 9)$. Dead-end threat: (9, 9) is the board edge. From (8, 9), I can go RIGHT (to 9, 9) or DOWN (to 8, 8). Both lead towards the apples. This is a very strong direction.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):** This moves away from the apple cluster and doesn't seem to have immediate follow-up goals.\n\n**4. Enemy Head Prediction/Head-on Collision**\n\n$H_0$ is at (2, 1). It is focused on the bottom-left area, possibly targeting (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (8, 1) or (0, 3).\nPossible moves for $H_0$ (2, 1):\n*   UP to (2, 2) (Apple!) - Most likely.\n*   DOWN to (2, 0) (Hit own body) - DEATH.\n*   LEFT to (1, 1) (Hit own body) - DEATH.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1) (Safe).\n\nSince (2, 2) is an apple, Snake 0 will almost certainly move UP. (2, 2) -> Apple taken by $H_0$.\n\nOur position (7, 9) is completely safe from $H_0$.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nThe move RIGHT to (8, 9) maintains excellent progress toward the dense apple cluster in the top right corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\n1. Move: RIGHT to (8, 9).\n2. From (8, 9), move DOWN to (8, 8) (to avoid the (9, 9) corner trap).\n3. From (8, 8), move RIGHT to (9, 8) (Eat apple).\n4. From (9, 8), move DOWN to (9, 7) (Eat apple).\n\nRIGHT",

Tail is (9, 2). I did not eat, so the segment (9, 2) will be free. My actual body remains are (7, 9) through (9, 1).\n\n*   Effective Obstacles (T + $H_0$):\n    *   My Body (excluding (9, 2), the current tail): (7, 9), (7, 8), ..., (9, 1).\n    *   Enemy Body: (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7).\n    *   Enemy Head $H_0$: (2, 2).\n\nNext move targets for $H_1$ (8, 9):\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body/Head)? | Apple (A)? | Safety |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 10) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEAD |\n| DOWN | (8, 8) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n| LEFT | (7, 9) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | No | DEAD (Backwards move) |\n| RIGHT | (9, 9) | No | No | No | No | SAFE |\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Goal: Capture Nearest Apple**\n\nI am at (8, 9). I am directly next to the high-value cluster:\n1. (9, 8): 2 steps (via DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT down DOWN).\n2. (9, 7): 3 steps.\n\nThis corner is isolated but offers two apples immediately.\n\n**3. Evaluating Safe Moves**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 9):** This puts me into the very corner. From (9, 9), my only safe move next turn is DOWN to (9, 8) (apple). This path is fixed and guarantees the apple.\n    *   Turn 38: RIGHT to (9, 9) (Safe)\n    *   Turn 39: DOWN to (9, 8) (Eat Apple: A)\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):** This moves me down the wall, offering some flexibility.\n    *   From (8, 8), I can move RIGHT to (9, 8) (apple) or DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8) (my body).\n    *   This is equally good for reaching the apple (9, 8) in 2 steps, but is less constrained than moving into (9, 9).\n\nSince I am trying to eat apples quickly and safely, constraining myself to (9, 9) is fine if it leads directly to an apple. However, (8, 8) keeps me slightly more flexible along the top wall before committing to the corner.\n\nLet's compare the future safety of (9, 9) vs (8, 8).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 9):\nNext turn, I must go DOWN to (9, 8) (Apple). If I'm forced to grow, my tail stays put, and I continue to block off (9, 9).\nIf I then go DOWN to (9, 7) (Apple), I will have secured the corner. This seems optimal for quick points.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 8):\nNext turn, I go RIGHT to (9, 8) (Apple).\nThen I go DOWN to (9, 7) (Apple).\nThis avoids the extreme corner (9, 9) which can feel restrictive, but both paths effectively secure the two apples.\n\nSince the opponent is far away (H0 at (2, 2)), the key is maximizing points and maintaining room. (8, 8) seems marginally better because it avoids having only one exit from (9, 9).\n\nLet's look at available space from (8, 8):\n1. R to (9, 8) (Apple)\n2. D to (8, 7) (Safe)\n\nLet's look at available space from (9, 9):\n1. D to (9, 8) (Apple)\n\nBoth lead to the apple the next turn. I will choose DOWN to (8, 8) for slightly better central flow control, although RIGHT is also perfectly safe.\n\n**4. Enemy Head Prediction**\n\n$H_0$ is at (2, 2). Possible moves:\n*   UP to (2, 3) (Safe, open area).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 2) (Safe, open area).\n*   DOWN to (2, 1) (Hit own body) - DEATH.\n*   LEFT to (1, 2) (Apple!) - Very likely.\n\nSnake 0 is likely moving LEFT to (1, 2) or UP to (2, 3). They are nowhere near me, so no conflict risk.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are excellent. I choose DOWN as it grants more immediate options after capturing the apple at (9, 8) (i.e., I can move back to (8, 7) or continue to (9, 7)).\n\nTurn 38: Move DOWN to (8, 8).\nTurn 39: Move RIGHT to (9, 8) (Apple).\nTurn 40: Move DOWN to (9, 7) (Apple).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nMove DOWN to (8, 8). Next, move RIGHT to (9, 8) to eat the first apple in the cluster. Then move DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the second apple.\n\nDOWN",

Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 8))**\n\n*   My Body Obstacles (T): Segments (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1).\n    *   Since I did not eat an apple last turn, the tail, (9, 1), will be free next turn.

Goal: Capture Nearest Apple**\n\nThe nearest apple is (9, 8), which is one step RIGHT. This is the primary objective.\n\n**3. Evaluating Safe Moves**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 8):** This moves onto the apple, guaranteeing an immediate score and growth. This is the optimal move.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 7):** This is safe, but delays eating the apple by one turn, requiring a move RIGHT later to get the apple.\n\nSince RIGHT leads directly to an apple, this is the chosen move.\n\n**4. Enemy Head Prediction**\n\n$H_0$ is at (1, 2). Possible moves:\n*   UP to (1, 3) (Safe, open area).\n*   RIGHT to (2, 2) (Hit own body) - DEATH.\n*   DOWN to (1, 1) (Hit own body) - DEATH.\n*   LEFT to (0, 2) (Apple?) - No apple at (0, 2).\n*   The apples reachable for Snake 0 are: (1, 7), (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 8), (2, 4). The closest are (0, 3) (2 steps via L, D) or (2, 4) (3 steps via U, R, U). (1, 7) is 5 steps away.\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained and must move UP to (1, 3) or LEFT to (0, 2). Both are far from my position and pose no threat.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nMove RIGHT to (9, 8) to secure the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nTurn 39: Move RIGHT to (9, 8) (Eat Apple).\nTurn 40: Move DOWN to (9, 7) (Eat Apple).\nTurn 41: Move DOWN to (9, 6) or towards (9, 4) (Apple) to maintain pressure on the right wall. The snake will be long, so careful tail management is necessary, but the right side seems secure for now.\n\nRIGHT",

My body currently forms a solid wall along column 4 (from y=0 to y=7), isolating the left side (columns 0-3). I must tread carefully to maximize space in this corridor. By moving LEFT now, I fill the corner at (0,2), preventing it from becoming a dead pocket. I will then move UP to eat the apple at (0,3). My subsequent path will zigzag upwards through columns 0, 1, and 2 to collect the dense cluster of apples at (2,4), (0,6), (3,6), (1,7), and (1,8) while keeping my body compact.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **LEFT**:\n  - **Type**: Positioning / Space-filling.\n  - **Immediate Gain**: None (positioning only).\n  - **Tactics**: Moving LEFT to (0,2) is critical for space efficiency. The square (0,2) is surrounded by my body at (0,1) and (1,2) and the left wall. If I do not enter it now, it becomes an inaccessible hole until my tail passes (0,1) in roughly 17 turns. Entering (0,2) allows me to seamlessly continue UP to (0,3) to eat the apple on the next turn.\n  - **Safety**: The move is safe. (0,2) is empty. The enemy snake is on the far side of the board (top-right) and poses no threat.\n\nLEFT",

This move also targets an apple.\n\n**2. Goal: Capture Nearest Apple**\n\nThe apple at (9, 7) is one step DOWN and is the only safe move available. This is the optimal move.\n\n**3. Evaluating Enemy Snake Constraints and Prediction**\n\n$H_0$ is at (0, 2).\nObstacles for $H_0$:\n*   Board boundaries: Left wall (x=-1), Down wall (y=-1).\n*   Own Body (T): (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6).\n*   Snake 1 Body (T): Many segments on the right side of the board.\n\nPossible moves for $H_0$ (0, 2):\n*   UP to (0, 3): SAFE. Targets an apple (A).\n*   DOWN to (0, 1): Collision with own body (T). DEAD.\n*   LEFT to (-1, 2): Off board. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 2): Collision with own body (Neck). DEAD.\n\nSnake 0 is essentially forced to move UP to (0, 3) to survive and eat an apple. Since Snake 0 is far away, there is no risk of collision.\n\n**4. Decision**\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is DOWN to (9, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nTurn 40: Move DOWN to (9, 7) (Eat Apple). We will be at (9, 7). Length 23.\nTurn 41: From (9, 7), our neck is at (9, 8).\n    Possible moves: LEFT to (8, 7) (Safe), DOWN to (9, 6) (Safe, open), RIGHT (Boundary).\n    We should aim for the apple at (9, 4) next. Move DOWN to (9, 6).\nTurn 42: From (9, 6), move DOWN to (9, 5) or (9, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

My intended path for the next few turns is (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), which secures two apples and cleanly fills the space below the obstacle at (3,4).\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP**:\n  - **Type**: Forced / Apple-grab.\n  - **Immediate Gain**: Consumes the apple at (0, 3), increasing score to 21.\n  - **Tactics**: This move is strictly forced. My head at (0, 2) is bounded by my neck at (1, 2) to the right, my body at (0, 1) below, and the wall to the left. Moving UP is the only legal option. Fortunately, it leads directly to an apple and open space in the upper-left quadrant.\n  - **Safety**: Safe. (0, 3) is empty (contains apple).\n\nUP",

Analyze Apple Targets**\n\nApples nearby (within 3 steps):\n1. (9, 4) - 3 steps (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, possibly).\n2. (8, 5) - 3 steps (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, or DOWN, LEFT, DOWN).\n3. (8, 2) - 5 steps.\n4. (9, 3) - 4 steps.\n\n**Pathing Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 6):**\n    *   This keeps us hugging the right wall, which has several apples below (9, 4) and (9, 3).\n    *   (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) (Eat Apple) is a clear path.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 7):**\n    *   This moves us toward the center but away from immediate targets on the far right.\n    *   We risk moving into the density of our own body segments at (7, 7), (8, 8), etc.\n\nGiven the strategic location of the apple at (9, 4), continuing DOWN the right edge seems optimal for maintaining a clear path and harvesting the next available food.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (H0 at (0, 3))**\n\nThe enemy just ate an apple at (0, 3). Its neck is (0, 2). Its tail remains blocked.\n\nPossible moves for $H_0$:\n*   UP to (0, 4): SAFE. Opens the path for $H_0$ to move upwards/right toward the center/top left apples.\n*   DOWN to (0, 2): DEAD (Neck).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 3): DEAD (Wall).\n*   RIGHT to (1, 3): SAFE.\n\nThe enemy is far away and does not pose an immediate threat. They likely move UP or RIGHT to continue gathering apples on the left side. My position on the right wall is secure.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 6) maintains control of the right corridor and sets up the next move to retrieve the apple at (9, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nTurn 41: Move DOWN to (9, 6). (Current choice). Length 23.\nTurn 42: From (9, 6), move DOWN to (9, 5). Length 23/24. (Sets up for 9, 4).\nTurn 43: From (9, 5), move DOWN to (9, 4) (Eat Apple). Length 24/25.\n\nDOWN",

(Moved DOWN last turn, did not eat).\n    *   Body (Neck): (9, 6).\n    *   Length: 22 segments (Tail at (8, 0)).\n    *   Apples: 22. Score advantage: +1.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head $H_0$: (2, 3).

Identify Obstacles**\n\n*   **Walls:** Standard boundaries.\n*   **Your Body (T1) new position:** Tail at (8, 0) releases (8, 0) unless we eat.\n    *   Body segments: (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0).\n*   **Enemy Body (T0):** Head is (2, 3). Body contains many cells in the bottom-left four quadrants.\n*   **Apples ($A$):** (1, 7), (0, 6), (5, 3), (8, 1), (2, 8), **(9, 4)**, (3, 6), (8, 5), (2, 4), (4, 8), (1, 8), (8, 2), (6, 3), (2, 7), (9, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 5))**\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body/Head)? | Apple (A)? | Safety | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (9, 6) | No | Yes (Neck/Backwards) | No | No | DEAD | Backwards move |\n| DOWN | (9, 4) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE (Eat) | **Priority Apple (9, 4)**. |\n| LEFT | (8, 5) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE (Eat) | Secondary Apple (8, 5). |\n| RIGHT | (10, 5) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEAD | Off board |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (eat (9, 4)) and LEFT (eat (8, 5)).\n\n**3. Decision: Target the Closest Apple**\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT lead to apples this turn!\n$A_1 = (9, 4)$ (1 step DOWN)\n$A_2 = (8, 5)$ (1 step LEFT)\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (9, 4).** This continues the trajectory down the right wall, immediately adjacent to the apple at (9, 3). This seems slightly better for clustering apples.\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (8, 5).** This moves us toward the center of the board, next to (8, 6) (open) and potentially opens up (8, 2) or (8, 1).\n\nSince both moves are safe and lead to an immediate meal, we must consider the relative position of future apples.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (9, 4):\n*   Next available apple: (9, 3) (1 step DOWN).\n*   Total gain: 2 apples in 2 turns.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (8, 5):\n*   Next available apple: (8, 2) or (8, 1) (3-4 steps away, possibly blocked by body), or (6, 3) (3 steps).\n*   The apple (9, 3) would still be 2 steps away (RIGHT, DOWN) or (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nThe path DOWN to (9, 4) followed by DOWN to (9, 3) is a clean, consecutive 2-apple haul. This maximizes efficiency and keeps us safely away from the enemy.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (H0 at (2, 3))**\n\nEnemy Snake H0 at (2, 3). Neck at (1, 3).\nPossible moves for H0: UP to (2, 4) (Eat Apple), RIGHT to (3, 3), LEFT to (1, 3) (Dead), DOWN to (2, 2) (Dead).\nEnemy will almost certainly move UP to (2, 4) to eat an apple. This leaves them squarely in the center-left. No collision risk.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nMove DOWN to (9, 4) to safely collect the apple, setting up the immediate collection of (9, 3) next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nTurn 43: Move DOWN to (9, 4) (Eat Apple). Length 23.\nTurn 44: From (9, 4), move DOWN to (9, 3) (Eat Apple). Length 24.\nTurn 45: From (9, 3), assess options. Likely move LEFT to (8, 3) or (7, 3) to approach (8, 5) or (8, 2) or (8, 1).\n\nDOWN",

Follows previous plan. |\n| LEFT | (8, 4) | No | No | No | No | SAFE | Moves towards other apples (8, 5, 8, 2, 8, 1). |\n| RIGHT | (10, 4) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEAD | Off board |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**3. Decision: Target the Imminent Apple**\n\nThe apple at (9, 3) is one step away (DOWN). This was the intended move following the previous turn's rationale, and it is safe.\n\n*   Move DOWN to (9, 3) is a direct, guaranteed apple.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8, 4):\n*   We miss the guaranteed apple at (9, 3).\n*   We get closer to (8, 5) (1 step away), (8, 2) (2 steps away), (8, 1) (3 steps away).\n*   However, we would lose the opportunity for the clean 2-apple haul along the wall.\n\nGiven the priority of consistent scoring and the safety of the path, DOWN is the optimal choice.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (H0 at (2, 4))**\n\nEnemy H0 is at (2, 4). Neck is (2, 3).\nUpcoming apples for H0 are (1, 7), (0, 6), (2, 8), (3, 6), (4, 8), (1, 8), (2, 7), (0, 5).\nH0 is likely aiming for the cluster of apples around (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), which are 3-4 steps away.\nPossible safe moves for H0: UP to (2, 5), LEFT to (1, 4), RIGHT to (3, 4).\n*   If H0 moves UP to (2, 5) or LEFT to (1, 4), they start moving toward the upper left quadrant.\n*   If H0 moves RIGHT to (3, 4), they move into a less congested area, but away from nearest apples.\n\nNo matter the enemy's move, they pose no collision threat to our snake at (9, 4) moving to (9, 3).\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nMove DOWN to collect the apple at (9, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nTurn 44: Move DOWN to (9, 3) (Eat Apple). Length 25.\nTurn 45: From (9, 3), the right edge is clear until the boundary. The snake is long. Focus on exiting the corner safely and targeting the next closest cluster of apples: (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 1), and (6, 3). A move LEFT to (8, 3) seems like the next logical step to open up the board.\nTurn 46: From (8, 3), target (8, 2) (DOWN) or (8, 5) (UP, LEFT).\n\nDOWN",

My immediate goal is to fill the gap in row 4 at (1,4) and (0,4) before moving upward to the apple-rich region in rows 5-9. By taking the path [(2,4) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,5)...], I ensure no \"holes\" (unreachable empty squares) are left behind, which maximizes my future maneuverability and control in the endgame.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **LEFT**: Moves head to (1, 4). This is a safe move into empty space. It is the first step in filling the small gap at row 4, preventing wasted space, and sets up a clean path to the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6).\n- **UP**: Moves head to (2, 5). While safe, skipping the empty squares at (1, 4) and (0, 4) would leave a \"hole\" surrounded by my body, reducing the total safe area available to me later.\n- **DOWN**: Immediately blocked by my own body (neck at (2, 3)).\n- **RIGHT**: Immediately blocked by my own body segment at (3, 4).\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the optimal move for safety and strategic space management.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 3))**\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body/Head)? | Apple (A)? | Safety | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (9, 4) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | No | DEAD | Backwards move |\n| DOWN | (9, 2) | No | Yes | No | No | DEAD | Collision with body at (9, 2) - which is not true based on the full body list. Let's check the board state. $H_1=(9,3)$. Body: (9, 4)...(8, 0). The space (9, 2) is empty. |\n| DOWN | (9, 2) | No | No | No | No | SAFE | Empty space. |\n| LEFT | (8, 3) | No | No | No | No | SAFE | Empty space. Moves toward other apples. |\n| RIGHT | (10, 3) | Yes | N/A | N/A | N/A | DEAD | Off board |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (9, 2) and LEFT (8, 3).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves**\n\nOur snake is long and currently positioned in the congested right side of the board. We just ate two apples along the right wall. The goal must now be to move into open territory or towards the next reachable apple cluster.\n\n*   **Apple Targets near (9, 3):**\n    *   (8, 4) (1 step LEFT, UP)\n    *   (8, 5) (2 steps LEFT, UP, UP)\n    *   (8, 2) (2 steps LEFT, DOWN)\n    *   (8, 1) (3 steps LEFT, DOWN, DOWN)\n    *   (5, 3) (4 steps LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN)\n    *   (6, 3) (3 steps LEFT, LEFT, UP)\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   This immediately opens up the possibility to move UP to (8, 4) (which has an apple $A$) next turn, or DOWN to (8, 2) (which has an apple $A$) the turn after.\n    *   $H_1' = (8, 3)$.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   This leads us deeper into the constricted lower right corner.\n    *   From (9, 2), we can only move LEFT to (8, 2) (Apple $A$). This is a good future step, but (8, 3) provides more immediate flexibility.\n    *   $H_1' = (9, 2)$.\n\nComparing the two: (8, 3) is more central and allows for movement toward both the upper-middle and lower-middle parts of the board. (9, 2) commits us to the bottom edge, which is currently heavily saturated by our own body (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 0).\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 3) sets up a guaranteed apple for the next turn at (8, 4).\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (H0 at (1, 4))**\n\n$H_0 = (1, 4)$. Neck $=(2, 4)$.\nSafe moves for $H_0$: UP (1, 5) (Apple A), LEFT (0, 4), DOWN (1, 3) (Collision with own body).\n\n*   Check (1, 3): Is $T_0$ at (1, 3)? Yes, (1, 3) is part of $T_0$'s body. So DOWN is unsafe.\n*   Safe moves for $H_0$: UP (1, 5) or LEFT (0, 4) or RIGHT (2, 4) (Collision with own body).\n*   Oh, $H_0=(1,4)$ and Neck $=(2,4)$. Moving RIGHT to $(2,4)$ is moving into the Neck. DEAD.\n\nSo, $H_0$ must move UP (to (1, 5) - Apple A at (0, 5) or (1, 7) or (0, 6) nearby) or LEFT (to (0, 4)).\n\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to (1, 5), they eat the apple at (0, 5) (Wait, (0, 5) is an apple, not (1, 5). (1, 5) is empty). $H_0$ is likely aiming for the cluster (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), etc.\n\nNo matter the move, the enemy is far away and does not pose a collision risk for our snake moving to (8, 3) or (9, 2).\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy and Final Decision**\n\nWe aim to break out of the corner and secure the nearest apples (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 2), (8, 1).\n\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 3). This is safe and provides maximum flexibility.\n2. Next turn (T46), if (8, 4) is available (Apple A), move UP. If (8, 2) is appealing, move DOWN. (8, 4) is generally higher and easier to access follow-up high apples.\n\nPlan:\nT45: LEFT to (8, 3).\nT46: UP to (8, 4) [Apple].\nT47: Decide between (8, 5) [Apple] or looping back down.\n\nThe move LEFT is the most strategic to open up the board.\n\nLEFT",

My immediate targets are the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6), followed by the cluster at (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 7), and (2, 8). By collecting these apples in a methodical, winding path, I maximize my score while maintaining a compact body shape that preserves space for the endgame. I will avoid leaving isolated empty squares (\"holes\") behind my path.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **LEFT**: Moves head to (0, 4). This squares is currently empty and adjacent to my head. Moving here allows me to subsequently move UP to the apple at (0, 5).\n- **UP**: Moving UP to (1, 5) would bypass (0, 4). Since (0, 4) is bordered by my body and the wall, skipping it now would likely render it inaccessible for the rest of the game (creating a \"hole\"), reducing my available territory.\n- **DOWN/RIGHT**: Blocked by my own body.\n- **Safety**: The enemy snake is far away at (9, 3) and poses no immediate threat.\n- **Benfits**: This move secures 100% board efficiency in the bottom-left corner and positions me perfectly to consume a chain of apples starting next turn.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 3))**\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body)? | Apple (A)? | Safety | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 4) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE | Eats an apple. Highly desirable. |\n| DOWN | (8, 2) | No | No | No | Yes | SAFE | Eats an apple. Viable. |\n| LEFT | (7, 3) | No | Yes | No | No | DEAD | Collision with body at (7, 3). |\n| RIGHT | (9, 3) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | No | DEAD | Backwards move. |\n\nSafe moves: UP (8, 4) and DOWN (8, 2). Both lead to apples!\n\n**3. Comparison of Safe Moves**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 4) [Apple]:**\n    *   Eats an apple. Length increases.\n    *   Next potential moves: UP to (8, 5) [Apple], LEFT to (7, 4) (safe but leads back toward old body), RIGHT to (9, 4) (your body/neck location last turn).\n    *   (8, 5) is an apple, providing a path to two consecutive apples. This is excellent.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 2) [Apple]:**\n    *   Eats an apple. Length increases.\n    *   Next potential moves: DOWN to (8, 1) [Apple], LEFT to (7, 2) (your body), RIGHT to (9, 2) (safe).\n    *   (8, 1) is an apple, providing a path to two consecutive apples. Also excellent.\n\n**4. Strategic Tie-Breaker (UP vs. DOWN)**\n\nBoth moves yield an apple and set up another apple the following turn. We must consider overall board position and potential for entrapment.\n\n*   Moving UP (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5) or (8, 6). This leads us toward the large cluster of apples (8, 5), (4, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (6, 9). This area seems less congested by our current body path than the bottom edge.\n*   Moving DOWN (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) (our body) or (9, 1). This keeps us near the bottom right edge, which is currently heavily blocked by our long tail segments (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2). While the apples are there, the immediate exit options are limited due to self-blockage.\n\nThe UP path (8, 4) leads into a slightly more open area of the board and provides better long-term navigation away from the clustered body segments at y=0, y=1, y=2.\n\n**5. Enemy Prediction (H0 at (0, 4))**\n\n$H_0 = (0, 4)$. Neck $=(1, 4)$.\nSafe moves for $H_0$: UP (0, 5) (Apple A), DOWN (0, 3) (Body T0).\n*   Check (0, 3): (0, 3) is part of T0's body. DOWN is unsafe.\n*   Safe moves: UP (to (0, 5) [Apple]) or RIGHT (to (1, 4) - Neck, DEAD) or LEFT (to (-1, 4), DEAD).\n\nThe enemy must move UP to (0, 5) and eat the apple. This is the only safe move unless the board state or body list is misinterpreted.\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to (0, 5), they are far away and pose no threat to $H_1$ moving to (8, 4) or (8, 2).\n\n**6. Final Decision**\n\nMove UP to (8, 4) to secure the apple and position for the next apple at (8, 5), leading into the upper half of the board which has more accessible space currently.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT46: UP to (8, 4) [Apple].\nT47: UP to (8, 5) [Apple].\nT48: Re-evaluate. Likely aiming toward (4, 8) or (6, 9).\n\nUP",

This approach maximizes apple intake while keeping my body compact and maintaining exit routes into the open space in columns 1, 2, and 3. I will avoid leaving isolated holes behind my path to preserve board efficiency.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP**: This moves the head to (0, 5). This cell is currently empty and contains an apple. This is the only legal move available; **LEFT** is a wall, **RIGHT** is blocked by my own body segment at (1, 4), and **DOWN** is blocked by my own body segment at (0, 3).\n- **Safety**: The enemy snake is located on the far right side of the board (Head at 8, 3), making any interaction impossible for the next several turns.\n- **Benefits**: Collects an apple immediately and positions the snake to collect another apple at (0, 6) on the next turn.\n\nUP",

This \"outside-in\" approach keeps my body compact, minimizes the risk of leaving unreachable gaps, and secures a high density of points safely away from the enemy snake on the right side of the board.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP**: The move to (0, 6) is safe, immediately captures an apple, and is the next step in my wall-following strategy.\n- **Options**: \n    - **RIGHT** to (1, 5) is safe but skips the adjacent apple and breaks the efficient vertical pathing. \n    - **DOWN** and **LEFT** are blocked by my body and the wall, respectively.\n- **Safety**: The enemy snake (ID 1) is currently constrained on the far right side of the board (column 8), posing no threat for the next several turns.\n\nUP",

Since we won't eat an apple this turn, the tail (7, 0) will move to (6, 0).\n*   **Obstacles (Enemy Body T0, excluding current tail (4, 4)):** [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n    *   The tail (4, 4) will move to (4, 3) (assuming the enemy doesn't grow).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 5))**\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body T0)? | Immediate Death? | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 6) | No | No | No | No | Safe. Open space. |\n| DOWN | (8, 4) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | YES | Backwards move. |\n| LEFT | (7, 5) | No | Yes | No | YES | Collides with body at (7, 5). |\n| RIGHT | (9, 5) | No | Yes | No | YES | Collides with body at (9, 5). |\n\nOnly one safe move: UP to (8, 6).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Prediction (H0 at (0, 6))**\n\n$H_0 = (0, 6)$. Neck $=(0, 5)$.\nSafe/Open neighbor cells for $H_0$:\n*   UP (0, 7): Open. (Closer to apples (1, 7), (2, 7)).\n*   DOWN (0, 5): Body/Neck. DEAD.\n*   LEFT (-1, 6): Boundary. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT (1, 6): Open. (Closer to apples (1, 7), (2, 7)).\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained by the board edge and its own body. It has to choose between (0, 7) and (1, 6). (1, 7) is an apple 1 step away from (0, 7) and 2 steps away from (1, 6).\nThe enemy will likely move UP to (0, 7) or RIGHT to (1, 6). Neither decision impacts your move to (8, 6).\n\n**4. Move Decision: UP**\n\nThe only safe move is UP to (8, 6). This moves us toward the relatively clear upper edge and positions us to potentially attack apples at (6, 9) or move left towards the large apple cluster on the top half of the board.\n\n**Long-term strategy planning:**\nWe are currently at (8, 6). The area directly above us is clear until the boundary, but the apples are centralized further left: (6, 9).\nNext turn (T49), from (8, 6):\n1. UP (8, 7): Clear, but far from apples.\n2. DOWN (8, 5): Backwards. DEAD.\n3. LEFT (7, 6): Clear. Good setup to hunt (6, 9) or move towards (3, 7) / (4, 8).\n4. RIGHT (9, 6): Body collision. DEAD.\n\nThe strategy should be to move LEFT/UP towards the dense apple areas in the top-left/mid-board (e.g., (6, 9), (4, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)). Move Left seems optimal next turn.\n\nCurrent move: UP.\n\nUP",

Analyzing its available moves from (8, 6)\u2014its only option this turn\u2014reveals it will be forced into either (8, 7) or (7, 6). Both of these cells are dead ends surrounded by its own body segments (specifically segments at 7,7; 8,8; 9,7; etc., which serve as recent body parts that will not move soon). It appears Snake 1 is effectively trapped and will likely perish within the next 2-3 turns.\n\n**Immediate Plan & Safety**\nGiven the high probability of the opponent's imminent elimination, my primary objective shifts to pure survival. Taking risks to optimize apple collection is unnecessary. \n1.  **Move**: I will proceed UP to (0, 7).\n2.  **Follow-up**: Continue UP to (0, 8) and then (0, 9).\n3.  **Reasoning**: Moving along the left wall (column 0) is the safest path. It ensures I do not create gaps or loops in my own body, keeps me far away from the enemy (just in case), and positions me in the top-left corner locally. If the game continues past the enemy's expected death, I will be in a perfect position to sweep columns 1 and 2 for points from the top down.\n\n**Move Explanation**\n- **UP**: Moves the head to (0, 7), an empty cell. It is safe from my body, the enemy, and walls. It maintains the \"wall-hugging\" topology that maximizes open space to my right.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

(Moved UP last turn, likely ate (0, 7) or (1, 7) - wait, board shows (0, 7) as '0' (head) and (1, 7) is 'A', so the enemy moved from (0, 6) to (0, 7) and did not eat the apple at (1, 7) yet. Enemy score is 24, so they must have eaten the turn before last).\n    *   Neck: (0, 6).\n    *   Length: 25 segments.\n    *   Apples collected: 24.\n*   **Apples ($A$):** (1, 7), (5, 3), (8, 1), (2, 8), (3, 6), (4, 8), (1, 8), (8, 2), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 9), (3, 1), (4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 7).\n\n**1. Identify Obstacles and Tail Movement**\n\n*   **Your Body (T1):** [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)].\n    *   Tail T1_last: (6, 0).

Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 6))**\n\n| Direction | Target Cell ($H'_1$) | Off-Board? | Self-Collision? | Enemy Collision (Body T0)? | Apple? | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 7) | No | No | No | No | Safe, leads towards (6, 9). |\n| DOWN | (8, 5) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | NO | Fatal (Backwards). |\n| LEFT | (7, 6) | No | No | No | No | Safe, leads towards (6, 9), (4, 6), (3, 7). |\n| RIGHT | (9, 6) | No | Yes | No | NO | Fatal (Body at (9, 6)). |\n\nTwo safe moves: UP (8, 7) and LEFT (7, 6).\n\n**3. Analyze Goals and Proximity to Apples**\n\nWe are looking for apples (1, 7), (5, 3), (8, 1), (2, 8), (3, 6), (4, 8), (1, 8), (8, 2), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 9), (3, 1), (4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 7).\n\n*   **Option UP (8, 7):**\n    *   Distance to (6, 9): Manhattan distance (MD) = |8-6| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n    *   Distance to (4, 8): MD = |8-4| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Option LEFT (7, 6):**\n    *   Distance to (6, 9): MD = |7-6| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n    *   Distance to (4, 6): MD = |7-4| + |6-6| = 3 + 0 = 3. (Closest immediate apple goal).\n    *   Distance to (3, 7): MD = |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Distance to (4, 5): MD = |7-4| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 6) gives access to (4, 6) in 3 moves, and also sets up for (6, 9). This move seems generally more central.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy Prediction (H0 at (0, 7))**\n\n$H_0 = (0, 7)$. Neck $=(0, 6)$.\nSafe/Open neighbor cells for $H_0$:\n*   UP (0, 8): Clear.\n*   DOWN (0, 6): Body/Neck. DEAD.\n*   LEFT (-1, 7): Boundary. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT (1, 7): Apple! This is the most likely move. $H'_0 = (1, 7)$.\n\nIf $H_0$ moves to (1, 7) (Apple), its neck will be (0, 7). This will lengthen the enemy snake to 26 segments.\n\n**5. Collision Check (H1 vs H0)**\n\nIf H1 goes UP (8, 7): No collision.\nIf H1 goes LEFT (7, 6): No collision.\n\n**6. Optimal Move Selection**\n\nThe LEFT move (7, 6) opens up more direct access to multiple nearby apples ((4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)) while staying clear of the enemy. It is a more efficient path toward a cluster of apples in the middle of the board than moving further into the corner (8, 7) just to chase (6, 9).\n\nFrom (7, 6), the next target is (6, 6) or (7, 5). (6, 6) is currently occupied by our body, but it's 10 segments back, which means given our current length (27), we won't free it up in time unless we eat multiple apples very soon. (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5) are also occupied.\n\nLet's re-examine the area around (7, 6).\n*   (6, 6) is T1.\n*   (8, 6) is T1 (old head).\n*   (7, 5) is T1.\n*   (7, 7) is T1.\n\nWait, if I move to (7, 6), my potential next moves are:\n1. UP (7, 7): Collision with body. DEAD.\n2. DOWN (7, 5): Collision with body. DEAD.\n3. LEFT (6, 6): Collision with body. DEAD.\n4. RIGHT (8, 6): Collision with body (new neck). DEAD.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 6), I create a deadly box around myself, only able to move into parts of my body. This is a severe constraint.\n\nLet's re-examine the body positions carefully for the move $H_1 \\to (7, 6)$:\nYour snake body (not including $H_1=(8, 6)$): [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)].\n\nIf $H'_1 = (7, 6)$.\nImmediate neighbors of (7, 6):\n*   (7, 7): Occupied by T1. Fatal.\n*   (7, 5): Occupied by T1. Fatal.\n*   (6, 6): Occupied by T1. Fatal.\n*   (8, 6): New neck. Fatal (Backwards).\n\nWait, the move LEFT to (7, 6) *is* safe for this turn, but it leads to an immediate trap next turn! $H_1=(8, 6)$ is surrounded by $T_1$ at (9, 6), (8, 5), (7, 6) (which is the move target). If (7, 6) is the new head, its neighbors are:\n*   (6, 6) [T1]\n*   (8, 6) [New neck]\n*   (7, 7) [T1]\n*   (7, 5) [T1]\n\nThis means moving LEFT ensures instant death on turn 50, unless I eat an apple. There are no apples at (7, 6).\n\nTherefore, LEFT is a bad move.\n\nLet's re-evaluate UP to (8, 7).\nIf $H'_1 = (8, 7)$.\nNeighbors of (8, 7):\n*   (8, 8): Occupied by T1.\n*   (8, 6): New neck.\n*   (7, 7): Occupied by T1.\n*   (9, 7): Occupied by T1.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 7), I am also trapped! (8, 7) is surrounded by (8, 8), (7, 7), (9, 7), and my newly placed neck (8, 6).\n\nIf both safe moves lead to an immediate trap, I must confirm if the tail movement will save me.\nTail $T_1$ is at (6, 0). Length L=27.\nThe segments that constrain (8, 7) are (8, 8), (7, 7), (9, 7). These are segments far away from the tail (6, 0).\n(8, 8) is segment 10.\n(7, 7) is segment 15.\n(9, 7) is segment 7.\nNone of these will clear in the next turn (T50).\n\nIf I am forced into a death trap: I must choose the move that keeps me alive the longest or gives me a very small chance of freedom.\n\nLet's look at the body arrangement again near (8, 6):\n9 . . . . . . A T T . (T at 9, 7, 9, 8)\n8 . A A . A . . T T T (T at 8, 8, 8, 9)\n7 0 A A A . . T T . T (T at 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 9)\n6 T . . A A T T . 1 T (T at 9, 6)\n5 T . . . A T T T T T (T at 8, 5, 9, 5)\n\nCurrent position (8, 6).\n**LEFT (7, 6):**\nNeighbors: (8, 6) [Neck], (9, 6) [T], (7, 7) [T], (7, 5) [T], (6, 6) [T].\nWait, is (9, 6) part of my body? Yes: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), **(9, 6)**, (9, 7)...].\nIs (7, 5) part of my body? Yes: [(7, 5), (7, 4)...].\nIs (6, 6) part of my body? Yes: [(6, 6), (5, 6)...].\nIs (7, 7) part of my body? Yes: [(7, 7), (6, 7)...].\nYes, moving LEFT to (7, 6) guarantees a fatal trap next turn (T50).\n\n**UP (8, 7):**\nNeighbors: (8, 6) [Neck], (9, 7) [T], (8, 8) [T], (7, 7) [T].\nIs (9, 7) part of my body? Yes: [..., (9, 6), **(9, 7)**, (9, 8)...].\nIs (8, 8) part of my body? Yes: [..., (9, 8), **(8, 8)**, (8, 9)...].\nIs (7, 7) part of my body? Yes: [..., (7, 8), **(7, 7)**, (6, 7)...].\nYes, moving UP to (8, 7) guarantees a fatal trap next turn (T50).\n\n**Is there an available apple nearby?**\nApple (6, 9) is 4 steps away from (8, 7) (UP path) AND 4 steps away from (7, 6) (LEFT path).\nApple (4, 8) is 5 steps away from (8, 7).\n\nIf both paths lead to an inevitable trap, I must choose the one that provides the best chance of eating an apple *if* the path opens up. Neither path has an apple in 4 moves, so I will die well before I get to free space UNLESS I move into a region where the tail segments are clearing. (6, 0) is clearing. This is too far away.\n\nLet's try to verify if any other path exists that I missed.\n\nMy structure is highly dense in the top right quadrant. I have sealed myself in.\n\n(8, 6) is surrounded by T at (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5).\n\nWait, (8, 6) is the head.\nT surrounding (8, 6):\nDOWN (8, 5). Neck.\nRIGHT (9, 6). Body segment 7.\nUP-RIGHT (9, 7) Body segment 8.\nUP (8, 8) is NOT blocked. (8, 7) is free space.\nUP-LEFT (7, 7) is NOT blocked. (7, 6) is free space.\n\nLet's re-read the body list: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]\n\n**Constraint check for (7, 6):**\n(7, 7) is segment 14. Yes, blocked.\n(7, 5) is segment 20. Yes, blocked.\n(6, 6) is segment 16. Yes, blocked.\n\nIf I move to (7, 6): T50 (7, 6)\nAvailable moves from (7, 6): None. I die T50.\n\n**Constraint check for (8, 7):**\n(8, 8) is segment 10. Yes, blocked.\n(7, 7) is segment 14. Yes, blocked.\n(9, 7) is segment 7. Yes, blocked.\n\nIf I move to (8, 7): T50 (8, 7)\nAvailable moves from (8, 7): None. I die T50.\n\nI must have miscalculated the available moves for one of the directions in Step 2.\nLet's re-verify the input:\n$H_1=(8, 6)$.\n1. UP (8, 7): No self-collision, No enemy collision, On board. SAFE.\n2. DOWN (8, 5): Self-collision (Neck). DEAD.\n3. LEFT (7, 6): No self-collision, No enemy collision, On board. SAFE.\n4. RIGHT (9, 6): Self-collision (Body segment 7). DEAD.\n\nOkay, I have two safe moves for T49: UP (8, 7) and LEFT (7, 6). But they both lead to immediate death on T50. Since the game is about winning *this turn*, and then maximizing chances on future turns, a move that guarantees future death is usually only acceptable if the alternative is immediate death, or if the \"death\" is escapable by eating the tail or an apple.\n\nNeither (8, 7) nor (7, 6) is an apple.\nNo segment blocking these moves will clear by T50.\n\nThis situation appears highly constrained, suggesting the previous move (to (8, 6)) was a mistake that sealed my death.\n\nHowever, maybe there is a tiny advantage in one path.\nPath UP (8, 7): It moves us toward (6, 9) (3 moves away from (8, 7) via (7, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 9)). But (7, 7) is blocked. If I go (8, 7) $\\to$ (7, 7) (Blocked) $\\to$ (6, 7) (Blocked).\nPath LEFT (7, 6): It moves us closer to the central apples (4, 6) (3 moves away). Path is blocked by (6, 6) and (7, 5).\n\nSince I am trapped regardless:\nUP (8, 7) requires moving into (8, 8), (7, 7), or (9, 7).\nLEFT (7, 6) requires moving into (7, 7), (7, 5), (6, 6), or (8, 6).\n\nWait, the board layout shows my snake body segments (T) in all directions around (8, 6), except UP (8, 7) and LEFT (7, 6).\n\nIf I choose UP (8, 7):\n$H_1$ is at (8, 7). Neck is (8, 6).\nThe tail moves from (6, 0) to (6, 1). Segment 26 (6, 1) frees up (6, 0).\nThe segments blocking (8, 7) are far from the tail.\n\nSince both moves result in a trap, I will choose the one that maintains a path towards the highest density of apples, which are generally located further left and up/mid-board.\n\nThe cluster of apples around $x=3, 4$ and $y=6, 7, 8$ ((3, 6), (4, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8)) is the richest target. Moving LEFT toward (7, 6) brings me closer to this cluster than moving UP toward (8, 7), which is mainly cornered.\n\nIf by some miracle the enemy head or body interaction could free me:\nEnemy $H_0$ is at (0, 7) and likely moves to (1, 7). This will not help free up any of my constraints in the top right.\n\nI am essentially picking my poison. I choose the move that sets me up best *if* I could survive the next turn, maybe hoping for a game mechanic I missed that saves me (e.g., if the enemy hits my body segment, it dies, potentially opening space for me if that segment was key).\n\nLet's stick with LEFT, as it generally trends towards more potential apples.\n\n**Revised immediate analysis of T50 (after moving to (7, 6)):**\nIf $H_1$ is at (7, 6). Neighbors are (7, 7)[T], (7, 5)[T], (6, 6)[T], (8, 6)[Neck]. All 4 directions lead to death. This is guaranteed death on T50.\n\nIf I must die, I must ensure I don't give Snake 0 an easy win. Since I have 2 apple lead, dying now means I might win by score tiebreaker if Snake 0 also dies, but Snake 0 is not constrained.\n\nGiven the apparent unavoidable trap, I must move LEFT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nT50 is inevitably fatal due to trapping at (7, 6) unless an apple magically appears at (7, 6) or (7, 7), (7, 5), or (6, 6). If I move LEFT, I die next turn. If I move UP, I die next turn. Since both outcomes are fatal, choose LEFT to slightly better position for mid-board apples in the unlikely event a snake collision opens up a path.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

This strictly linear movement avoids self-collision risks and keeps my potential future pathing simple.

Segment 17/18. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 6) | No | Yes (Neck) | No | **FATAL** (Backwards). |\n\n**CRITICAL FINDING:** Snake 1 is currently trapped in a 1x1 box by its own body and neck. All four available moves are immediately fatal collisions. The previous turn's rationale correctly identified this incoming trap, but the move was still executed.\n\n*If this engine works based on the assumption that an absolute trap (all 4 directions fatal) results in immediate game over for the snake, the game state should reflect that on the next turn.*\n\nHowever, I must provide *A* move. If the game mechanics require me to choose one move even if it leads to death, I must choose based on the best path / least resistance, although the outcome remains fatal.\n\n**2. Reassessment based on immediate death**\n\nSince all moves are fatal, the chosen move is irrelevant to survival unless:\na) An apple is present in one of the death cells (No).\nb) An enemy movement happens to free one of these cells (Highly unlikely based on $H_0$ position (0, 8)).\n\nI will choose the move that trends towards the overall desired direction (the apple cluster around x=3, 4). That direction is LEFT. Even though (6, 6) is a segment of my body, moving LEFT attempts to continue the general strategy.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Collision (Irrelevant but necessary for completeness)**\n$H_0 = (0, 8)$. Neck $=(0, 7)$.\nSafe moves for $H_0$:\n1. UP (0, 9): Clear, but leads to corner.\n2. RIGHT (1, 8): Apple! (Most likely move).\n3. LEFT (-1, 8): Boundary (DEAD).\n4. DOWN (0, 7): Neck (DEAD).\n\nIf $H_0$ moves to (1, 8) and eats, it grows. This does not affect my corner trap.\n\n**4. Final Move Selection**\nSince all moves lead to immediate self-collision and death, I must select one. I default to LEFT as it maintains the directional momentum towards the desired mid-board apple cluster, though the outcome is predetermined.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nSnake 1 is currently in an unresolvable trap at (7, 6). Regardless of the move selected (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), the snake will hit its own body/neck and die this turn. The game state is terminal for Snake 1.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",
