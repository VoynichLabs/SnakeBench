Which is better?  \n\nLooking at board:  \n- RIGHT to (5,3) puts me near center right, with apple at (6,9) far away, but many apples on left side later.  \n- DOWN to (4,2) puts me near apples at (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (4,2) eaten, so maybe more apples in cluster.  \n\nBut also, enemy is at (3,7) \u2014 far from me now, so not an immediate threat.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **RIGHT** because it keeps me more central and leaves open movement in all four directions next turn, while DOWN leaves me at bottom edge sooner.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (5,3), I\u2019ll have length 2 (head and 1 body segment at old head (4,3)).

So I must go DOWN first to (5,2), then LEFT to (4,2) next turn if apple still there.  \n- Alternatively, go RIGHT to (6,3) \u2014 moves away from (4,2).  \n- UP to (5,4) \u2014 moves away from (4,2).  \n\nSo DOWN seems best to eventually get (4,2).  \n\nCheck safety after moving DOWN to (5,2):  \nNext turn from (5,2), body at (5,3) and (4,3). Possible moves then: UP back to (5,3) is body (dead), LEFT to (4,2) if apple there, RIGHT to (6,2), DOWN to (5,1).

So 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to apple cluster at bottom left (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (4,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan**  \n\nAfter eating (4,2) next turn, I\u2019ll have length 3, can target (3,4) or (2,2) etc. Keep enemy in mind \u2014 enemy is far away for now, so focus on eating apples safely.

The closest apple is at (4,8), which is directly to the left, but moving LEFT would take me to (3,8)\u2014which is already my body segment and thus fatal (hitting my own body). Moving UP to (4,9) is possible but that cell is occupied by an apple for another snake and is not an apple for me, and it doesn't immediately gain me a point. Moving DOWN to (4,7) is safe but doesn't get me an apple this turn. The apple at (4,8) is directly adjacent to my head to the left, but I can't move there without dying (since that's my body). However, reviewing the board, (4,8) is currently marked as 'T' (my tail?), but in the provided body list my only body segment is (3,8), so (4,8) is actually empty and not my body. Wait, let's clarify: my head is at (4,8), body is [(3,8)], so (4,8) is head, (3,8) is body. Therefore, (4,7), (5,8), (4,9), (3,8) are the adjacent cells. (3,8) is my body\u2014so LEFT is fatal. RIGHT to (5,8) is empty and safe. UP to (4,9) is an apple location, but it's not listed as an apple for me to eat (apples are at (1,2), (2,0), etc., and (4,9) is marked with an 'A' but let's check the apples list: (4,9) is listed as an apple location). Yes, (4,9) is in the apples list. However, moving UP from (4,8) to (4,9) would take me onto an apple, letting me grow and collect a point immediately. That's even better than moving RIGHT, which doesn't collect an apple. So UP is the optimal move: it's safe, doesn't hit my body or another snake, and collects an apple immediately. This grows my snake and gives me more options for future moves. \n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (4,9), I will reassess my position and continue moving toward the cluster of apples in the lower and right sections of the board, always checking for safe paths and watching enemy movements.\n\nUP",
