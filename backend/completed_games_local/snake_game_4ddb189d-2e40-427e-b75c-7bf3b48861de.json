UP to (5, 8): This moves me directly to an apple at (5, 8). This would give me 1 point and grow my snake. The enemy snake is at (3, 9), so this move puts me adjacent to the enemy. There's a risk of collision if the enemy also moves DOWN to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 9).\n\n2. DOWN to (5, 6): This moves me away from the apples and towards the bottom of the board.\n\n3. LEFT to (4, 7): This moves me left, which is safe and doesn't immediately put me in danger of collision with the enemy.\n\n4. RIGHT to (6, 7): This moves me right, giving me more space and flexibility. From (6, 7), I can then plan to move towards the apples in a way that avoids the enemy.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position at (3, 9) and the apples at (5, 8) and (4, 8), moving UP to (5, 8) puts me in a good position to eat an apple. However, the risk of collision is real if the enemy also moves DOWN to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 9).\n\nOn the other hand, moving RIGHT to (6, 7) gives me more space and flexibility. From (6, 7), I can then plan my next moves to approach the apples safely. This also keeps me safe from immediate collision with the enemy.\n\nGiven that this is still early in the game (turn 4 of 150), I should prioritize safety and positioning for the long term. Moving RIGHT to (6, 7) provides better flexibility and reduces the immediate collision risk with the enemy. From there, I can plan my next moves to approach the apples safely.\n\nTherefore, I'll move RIGHT to (6, 7).\n\nRIGHT",
