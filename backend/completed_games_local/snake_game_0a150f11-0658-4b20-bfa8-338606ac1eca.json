Actually, from (4,7), LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then LEFT to (1,7) \u2014 but need to check body growth: if I eat apple next turn, body grows behind head, so path planning must account for body blocking.  \n\n---\n\n**Body growth consideration:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (3, 7), no apple eaten. Next turn body becomes [(3,7), (4,7), (5,7)? Wait, check: currently body length is 1 segment [(5,7)]. After moving head to (3,7), body becomes [(3,7), (4,7)]? Actually, snake growth happens only when eating apple. So without eating apple, body just follows head: new head at (3,7), body segments shift: old head (4,7) becomes first body segment, tail (5,7) disappears? No \u2014 body length stays same unless apple eaten. So body = [(4,7)] after move, tail gone? Let's think:  \n\nStart: head=(4,7), body=[(5,7)] length=1.  \nMove head to (3,7). Body segments follow: segment1 goes to old head position (4,7). Tail (5,7) is gone. So new state: head=(3,7), body=[(4,7)].  \n\nSo after LEFT, my body blocks (4,7) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **LEFT to (3,7)**:  \n   Next turn body=[(4,7)], head=(3,7). Possible moves: UP(3,8), DOWN(3,6), LEFT(2,7), RIGHT(4,7) blocked by body. So 3 directions open.  \n\n2. **UP to (4,8)**:  \n   Next turn body=[(4,7)], head=(4,8). Possible moves: UP(4,9), DOWN(4,7) blocked by body, LEFT(3,8), RIGHT(5,8). So 3 directions open.  \n\n3. **DOWN to (4,6)**:  \n   Next turn body=[(4,7)], head=(4,6). Possible moves: UP(4,7) blocked by body, DOWN(4,5), LEFT(3,6), RIGHT(5,6). So 3 directions open.  \n\nAll safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- UP: moves toward (5,9) but can't reach it directly yet (need to go around body later).  \n- DOWN: moves toward (5,3) and (1,3) but farther from (1,7).  \n- LEFT: moves toward (1,7) directly along y=7.  \n\n(1,7) is closest apple. LEFT seems best for apple gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter LEFT this turn to (3,7), next turn I can go LEFT again to (2,7) (safe if no enemy moves into it), then (1,7) to eat apple. Need to check that enemy won't cut me off \u2014 enemy is far away at y=1, so low risk.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

But wait \u2014 checking:  \n\nTurn 10: head at (2,8), moved RIGHT to (3,8) where apple was. So eaten apple: growth occurs at end of turn 10.  \nSo now start of turn 11: we have already grown? Let's see:   \nSnake head now at (3,8), body from previous turn: [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)] plus new segment at old tail position? No \u2014 at the end of turn 10 after eating, body becomes: head=new pos (3,8), then segments from previous head (2,8), then (1,8), then (1,7) \u2014 length 4 already. Yes.\n\nConfirming: start of turn 10 body: [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]  \nMove head to (3,8) \u2192 eat apple \u2192 body becomes [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7)], length 4.\n\nSo now body correctly listed at start of turn 11: Head (3,8), Body: [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)], length 4. Yes correct.\n\nApples remaining: (0,0), (5,9), (1,3), (3,0), (8,7) \u2014 wait original apples at start were (0,0), (5,9), (1,3), (3,0), (8,7) \u2014 apple at (3,8) was eaten last turn (apple removed). So OK.\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (3,8):**\n\n- UP (3,9): empty, on board. Safe. Also closer to apple (5,9).\n- DOWN (3,7): empty, safe.\n- LEFT (2,8): my own body (segment right behind head) \u2192 NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT (4,8): empty, safe.\n\nSafe directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Best choice:**\n\nApple at (5,9) is closest valuable target. UP (3,9) gets closer to it, then can go RIGHT twice to get it. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,2), far away, head at (3,2), body [(3,3),(4,3)], so no immediate threat to me.\n\nRIGHT (4,8) also reasonable, heading toward apple (8,7) eventually but that\u2019s further.\n\nEnemy snake could go toward apples (1,3) or (3,0), but not competing for (5,9) yet.\n\nUP seems best: keeps me near top row where (5,9) is, maximizes future options (from (3,9) next turn: moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\u2014all safe).\n\nRIGHT leads to being at (4,8) next to my own body at (3,8),(2,8)\u2014could risk trapping myself later since body is to left/west.\n\nUP opens space.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:** After UP to (3,9), next turn go RIGHT toward (5,9).

Wait, enemy body: head (3,1) followed by (3,2), (3,3).  \nSo for enemy:  \nUP (3,2) = moving into its own body \u2192 suicide (invalid).  \nDOWN (3,0) = empty (apple there).  \nLEFT (2,1) = empty.  \nRIGHT (4,1) = empty.  \n\nSo enemy will likely choose DOWN to get apple at (3,0) or LEFT/RIGHT for safety.  \nNo chance of head-on collision with me immediately since I\u2019m at (3,9), enemy far away.\n\n---\n\n**3 \u2014 Apple targeting:**\n\nNearby apples: (5,9) is close. From (4,9) next turn I can go to (5,9) if apple still there.  \nFrom (2,9) next turn I can go to (1,9) then (1,8) is my body so dangerous later. Actually (1,8) is my tail \u2014 next turn my tail might move\u2026 but if I don\u2019t eat apple next turn, tail moves forward\u2014risky.\n\nBetter: go RIGHT to (4,9). That sets up to eat (5,9) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**4 \u2014 Future options after each safe move:**\n\nIf RIGHT (4,9): Next turn from (4,9):  \nPossible moves: UP (off board), DOWN (4,8) safe (empty now), LEFT (3,9) safe (but just left), RIGHT (5,9) apple.  \nSo actually from (4,9) I have DOWN and RIGHT as safe next moves if apple remains. But UP off board. LEFT back to (3,9) might be possible depending on tail movement, but need to check tail next turn: tail at (1,8) moves forward to (2,8)? Actually tail movement: This turn my head moves to (4,9), rest of body follows: new body: head (4,9), then (3,9), (3,8), (2,8); tail (1,8) gone because no apple eaten this turn. Wait\u2014apple eaten? This turn: moving to (4,9) \u2014 no apple there. So snake length stays 4 segments => tail moves: old tail (1,8) disappears, body becomes:   \n[(4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8)].\n\nSo next turn from (4,9) body segments: (3,9), (3,8), (2,8) \u2192 so LEFT to (3,9) would collide with my own body. So next turn from (4,9) safe moves: DOWN (4,8) empty, RIGHT (5,9) apple. So two options.  \n\nIf LEFT (2,9): body next turn: [(2,9),(3,9),(3,8),(2,8)] \u2014 tail (1,8) gone.  \nFrom (2,9) next turn: UP off board; DOWN (2,8) body segment (my own) => unsafe; LEFT (1,9) empty; RIGHT (3,9) body segment => unsafe.  \nSo only LEFT next turn. That\u2019s a dead-end path: after LEFT to (1,9), then only DOWN (1,8) my body? Wait: from (1,9): DOWN (1,8) = body? yes, body next turn: segment (2,8) etc. Let\u2019s trace: after turn 12 move LEFT to (2,9): body: (3,9),(3,8),(2,8) behind. Then turn 13: only move possible is LEFT to (1,9). Then turn 14: from (1,9): possible moves: UP off board, DOWN (1,8) body segment? Check body turn 14: tail advances each turn unless eat apple. This becomes trapped quickly.  \n\nSo LEFT is risky \u2014 limits options severely.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT is better: leads to (4,9), can get apple (5,9) next turn, more future options.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 is (4,8) in my body? Let\u2019s verify: body coords: (3,9), (3,8), (2,8). (4,8) not in there. Also, not in enemy body (enemy body all near row 3 below).

Apple targeting**  \nFrom (4,9):  \n- Apple at (5,9) is one step RIGHT. Eating it next turn is possible if we go RIGHT now.  \n- Apple at (3,7) far, but DOWN toward row 8 then row 7 could be a plan for longer term.\n\n---\n\n**3. Safety next turn from each option**  \n\n**RIGHT to (5,9)**:  \nEat apple: length becomes 5, tail stays where it was.  \nNext turn from (5,9): body segments: (5,9) = head, (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8) = tail.  \nPossible moves from (5,9):  \n- UP off board  \n- DOWN (5,8): empty, safe  \n- LEFT (4,9): body segment \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT off board  \nSo only DOWN is safe afterward. That\u2019s restrictive \u2014 could trap if not careful.\n\n**DOWN to (4,8)**:  \nNo apple eaten, so tail moves: body becomes [(4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8)] \u2014 tail (2,8) disappears.  \nFrom (4,8) next turn possible moves:  \n- UP (4,9) = body segment \u2192 no  \n- DOWN (4,7) \u2192 empty (check enemy: enemy body rows 0-3, so safe) \u2192 yes  \n- LEFT (3,8) = body segment \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT (5,8) \u2192 empty \u2192 yes  \n\nTwo safe moves afterward: DOWN and RIGHT. Better future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy possible action**  \nEnemy at (3,0):  \nNear apple (3,0) is under its head, so they will eat it this turn (move DOWN into (3,0)? Wait, their head is (3,0) now? No \u2014 hold on: Board shows head at (3,0)? Let\u2019s check:  \n\nBoard state at turn 13 start says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (3, 0)\". That means they are already on apple (3,0)? But apples list has (3,0) but didn't appear in earlier list? Actually apples at (0,0),(5,9),(1,3),(8,7),(3,7) \u2014 no (3,0). My mistake: (3,0) is enemy head, not an apple.  \n\nBut bottom row in board display: \"(0,0) A ... 1\". That means: A at (0,0), Snake 1 head at (3,0). So enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple this turn unless they move to an apple. Their possible moves: from (3,0): UP (3,1) = body segment? Their body: [(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)] \u2014 so UP into own body \u2014 no. DOWN off board \u2014 no. LEFT (2,0) empty, RIGHT (4,0) empty. So enemy can only go LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 not toward me.\n\nNo collision risk with enemy.\n\n---\n\n**5. Conclusion**  \nRIGHT leads to apple but leaves only one safe move next turn (trapping risk).  \nDOWN leads to no apple but keeps flexibility (two safe moves next turn), also positions to go toward apple (3,7) later or other apples.\n\nSince keeping options open is key, DOWN is better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \nFrom (4,8), move toward (3,7) apple if enemy path clear. Keep space to avoid dead ends.\n\n**Final move**:  \nDOWN",

Immediate danger check** from (4,8):\n\n- **UP** (4, 9): Occupied by my body segment \u2192 invalid.\n- **DOWN** (4, 7): Empty, on board \u2192 safe.\n- **LEFT** (3, 8): Occupied by my body segment \u2192 invalid.\n- **RIGHT** (5, 8): Empty, on board \u2192 safe.\n\nSo possible moves: **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**2. Apple targeting**  \nFrom (4,8):\n- Apple at (3,7) is one step DOWN then one step LEFT \u2014 close but not reachable in one move.\n- Apple at (5,9) is one step UP (blocked) then one step RIGHT \u2014 not reachable in one move.\n- Apple at (8,7) is further east but might be a longer-term goal.\n\n---\n\n**3. Safety next turn from each option**  \n\n**DOWN to (4,7)**:  \nTail moves \u2014 body: [(4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9)] losing tail (3,8).  \nFrom (4,7) next turn:  \n- UP (4,8) = body segment \u2192 no  \n- DOWN (4,6) empty \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT (3,7) = apple, check danger: enemy far; safe unless enemy heads there same turn \u2014 possible but unlikely. But need to check if enemy snake can reach (3,7) this turn: enemy head (2,0) possible moves: LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0) body? Wait 3,0 is body segment so enemy can go LEFT (1,0) or DOWN off board? No, enemy at (2,0): UP (2,1) empty? Maybe yes. Actually let's check: Snake1 body: [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)]. Possible enemy moves from (2,0):  \n  - UP (2,1): empty safe  \n  - DOWN off board \u2192 no  \n  - LEFT (1,0): empty safe  \n  - RIGHT (3,0): own body \u2192 no  \n  So they can go UP or LEFT. They can\u2019t reach apple far away in one move but over 7 turns later maybe. We'll ignore that risk for now. Actually (3,7) apple is far away from enemy \u2014 safe to target next turn.  \n  So from (4,7), LEFT goes to apple (3,7). That\u2019s good if safe. So LEFT blocked? Enemy body no; my body? After eating apple at (3,7) body grows but need to check survival after eating: eat apple then next turn stuck? Will check later.  \n  Actually first check immediate next turn moves after DOWN: DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7) \u2014 all empty? Yes, so 3 moves safe after eating next turn if LEFT chosen. Good flexibility.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,8)**:  \nBody: [(5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9)] tail lost (3,8).  \nFrom (5,8) next turn:  \n- UP (5,9) = apple. Check danger: enemy far. But after eating: body length 5, possible moves from (5,9)? UP off board, DOWN (5,8) body segment, LEFT (4,9) body segment, RIGHT off board \u2014 only one safe next move after eating? Wait only DOWN (5,8) body segment afterwards so no safe moves after UP to apple \u2014 trap immediately after? Yes:  \nLet\u2019s simulate: turn 15: move UP to (5,9) eat apple, body now: [(5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9)]. Turn 16 from (5,9): only DOWN to (5,8) \u2014 but (5,8) occupied by my body segment \u2192 suicide. So eating (5,9) apple will trap me unless I have alternative next turn \u2014 but no alternative. So must avoid going RIGHT if it sets up that trap.  \n\nSo DOWN safer than RIGHT \u2014 DOWN keeps more options open.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy possible action**  \nEnemy at (2,0) far away, no immediate threat; they likely moving toward apple (0,0) or (1,3).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Conclusion**  \nRIGHT leads to route that traps me if I go for (5,9) apple next turn. DOWN gives flexibility and positions toward (3,7) apple safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \nFrom (4,7) next turn, strongly consider LEFT to (3,7) to eat apple unless enemy suddenly nearby. Then from (3,7) plan escape routes carefully.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s reconstruct:\n\nLast head was (4, 7) and body parts: (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), plus eaten apple in last move means body length 4 \u2192 grow to 5: so body now is: (4, 7) [new segment from growth], (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9) plus one more segment \u2014 but wait, that's wrong \u2014 actually when moving to (3, 7) and eating apple, the new head is (3, 7), old head (4, 7) becomes first body segment, and tail stays same except the tail end doesn't move, so snake length = 5: Body = [(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)] + no new segment because eating apple means growth happens at the tail next turn? Let me rethink:\n\nIn standard Snake: when you eat apple, at end of the turn your tail doesn\u2019t move, so you grow by keeping tail in place, making body length +1.\n\nSo: head was (4, 7), body segments: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)], length=4.  \nMove to (3, 7), eat apple. New head = (3, 7). New body = [old head (4, 7)] + [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)] but since we ate apple, tail doesn\u2019t move: so length becomes 5. Body = [(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)], plus a new segment? No \u2014 total segments after move: head (3, 7), then segments: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9). That\u2019s length 4 body segments plus head = total length 5. Correct.\n\nSo body coordinates: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9).\n\nCheck board: seems consistent: T's at (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9) with my head at (3,7) and apple eaten there.\n\n---\n\nFrom (3, 8) next turn: check adjacent:\n- UP (3, 9): body segment (tail) \u2192 invalid.\n- DOWN (3, 7): body (the neck) \u2192 invalid.\n- LEFT (2, 8): empty.\n- RIGHT (4, 8): body segment \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo only 1 safe move next turn: LEFT. That\u2019s risky (dead end potential).\n\nFrom (3, 6) next turn:\n- UP (3, 7): neck \u2192 invalid.\n- DOWN (3, 5): empty.\n- LEFT (2, 6): empty.\n- RIGHT (4, 6): empty.\n\nSo 3 safe moves.

Actually: from (3,7) going LEFT to (2,7), then next move LEFT again = (1,7) apple. So if I go LEFT now, next turn I can eat apple at (1,7) with possibly 2 exits afterward (UP/DOWN from (1,7)).\n\nEnemy snake at (0, 0) might go toward (1, 7)?

Their body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)] \u2014 so (1, 0) is their neck \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo enemy only move: UP to (0, 1). They are moving toward top? Not immediate threat.\n\n---\n\nGiven that UP leads to only 1 escape next turn, it\u2019s dangerous.  \nLEFT or DOWN both give flexibility.  \nLEFT sets up for apple (1, 7) next turn, which is good for score and enemy unlikely to get there before me.\n\n**Plan**: Go LEFT toward apple (1, 7), eat next turn, then check exits to avoid trapping near left wall.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Next moves from (1,6): DOWN (1,5) empty, LEFT (0,6) empty, RIGHT (2,6) empty \u2192 3 options. Good.\n3. **LEFT (0,7)**: Empty on board. Safe? Yes. Next moves from (0,7): UP (0,8) empty, DOWN (0,6) empty, RIGHT (1,7) is my body (so only 2 safe moves). But enemy head at (1,1) could move UP to (1,2) or (0,1) to (0,2) \u2014 far from me. Still safe.\n4. **RIGHT (2,7)**: This is my own body segment (neck) \u2014 would die immediately. **Eliminated**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- (5,9) \u2014 far.\n- (1,3) \u2014 4 steps away (down then left/right).\n- (8,7) \u2014 far.\n- (4,2) \u2014 far.\n- (9,0) \u2014 far.\n\nClosest apple is (1,3) but it's not directly reachable in one move.

Better to go UP or LEFT to stay safe and get space.\n\nUP seems best: moves me away from enemy, keeps options open, and heads toward top row apples later.\n\n**Final choice:** UP\n\nUP",

Immediate safe moves from (1, 8):**\n\n- **UP (1, 9)**: empty on board. Check for dangers: not off board, not my body, not enemy body since enemy is far. Safe.\n- **DOWN (1, 7)**: my own body segment \u2014 would die instantly. **Not safe**.\n- **LEFT (0, 8)**: empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (2, 8)**: empty.

DOWN (1, 1) is its body \u2192 not allowed. So enemy can go UP/LEFT/RIGHT.\n\nBut enemy isn't an immediate threat to my head position since I'm at y=8, they're at y=2.\n\nStill, I should think ahead: The apple at (1, 3) is very close to them\u2014they'll likely go UP to (1, 3) to eat it next turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple gathering strategy:**\n\nClosest apple to me:  \n- (5, 9): 4 steps away (right, then along top).  \n- (8, 7): farther.  \n- (1, 3) is closer physically but currently contested \u2014 enemy is about to get it. Not worth competing unless I'm sure I won't die.\n\nEnemy will likely path toward (1, 3). Maybe after eating it, they'll move up toward (4, 2)? Could create conflict.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility evaluation:**\n\nFrom (1, 8):\n\n- UP (1, 9): Then next moves: LEFT (0, 9), RIGHT (2, 9) \u2014 both open; DOWN (1, 8) is body next turn. So 2 exits after UP.  \n- LEFT (0, 8): Then moves: UP (0, 9) open, DOWN (0, 7) open, RIGHT (1, 8) into body \u2014 so 2 exits after LEFT.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8): Then moves: UP (2, 9) open, DOWN (2, 7) body (my snake), LEFT (1, 8) body \u2014 only 1 safe exit. So RIGHT reduces future options.\n\nThus: UP and LEFT preserve flexibility better.\n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term positioning:**\n\nGoing UP puts me near (5, 9) apple path.  \nLEFT keeps me near left wall \u2014 might get cramped later.\n\nBetter positioning: UP toward top row apples.\n\nAlso, enemy snake is short (length 5 after eating), but my length is 6 (5 apples + initial segments).

Yes, last turn enemy was at (1,3) with 5 apples => length 5 body segments (total length 6). Actually my mistake: their apples were 5 last turn, so length 6 (head + 5 body segments). Check: Now their head at (1, 3), body: (1, 2), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)? That's 6 segments total if they moved UP to (1,3) and grew. Yes, they must have eaten (1,3) apple this turn, so now they have 6 apples and length 7 (head + 6 body). Enemy body length is head + 6 body segments = 7 total. Let's verify: In last turn's board, apple at (1,3) \u2014 now it's gone in current board. Yes, they ate it. So enemy length 7 now.\n\n**Safe moves from (1,9):**\n- UP: (1,10) \u2014 off board \u2192 **dead**\n- DOWN: (1,8) \u2014 my body segment \u2192 **dead**\n- LEFT: (0,9) \u2014 empty, safe\n- RIGHT: (2,9) \u2014 empty, safe\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (1,3): possible moves: up (1,4) empty, left (0,3) empty, right (2,3) empty, down (1,2) body \u2014 unsafe. So enemy can move up/left/right.\n\nThey might go toward (4,2) apple next.\n\n**My plan:**\nNearby apples: (5,9) is closest. From (1,9), to get to (5,9) I need to go RIGHT multiple steps, but first I must move RIGHT this turn. After RIGHT to (2,9), next turn I can go to (3,9), (4,9), then (5,9), eating apple. Or go (2,9) then (2,8) if needed.\n\nLEFT to (0,9) leads to left edge, fewer apples nearby, but keeps me safe.\n\n**Future mobility:**\n- After RIGHT (2,9): next moves: UP off board (dead), DOWN (2,8) empty, LEFT (1,9) body, RIGHT (3,9) empty. So only DOWN and RIGHT next turn. Kind of limited.\n- After LEFT (0,9): next moves: UP off board (dead), DOWN (0,8) empty, RIGHT (1,9) body, LEFT off board (dead). So only DOWN is safe next turn. That\u2019s even more limited.\n\nComparing: RIGHT gives 2 safe moves next turn; LEFT gives 1 safe move. So RIGHT is better for flexibility.\n\n**Longer term:**\nAfter RIGHT, I can go DOWN (2,8) to open up more options, then approach (6,6) apple. Enemy is far away at bottom left.\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT is better for both apple pathing and mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

But then I\u2019m trapped along top: actually after eating at (5, 9), only DOWN and RIGHT (if (6, 9) empty) safe \u2192 but (6, 9) is empty, so yes: from (5, 9) next moves: DOWN (5, 8) safe, RIGHT (6, 9) safe (2 options). That\u2019s okay.  \n\nStill, DOWN now yields more options immediately and lets me go toward middle apples (6, 6) later.  \n\nActually, choosing DOWN now keeps flexibility. RIGHT forces me along top edge.  \n\nGiven that, I'll choose the safer mobility option: **DOWN** to avoid being stuck along top edge next turn after possibly eating apple.  \n\nDOWN",

If enemy contests bottom (unlikely), after (1,0) divert RIGHT/UP via row0-1 cols2-6 to (6,8). Monitor enemy post-(2,2) path.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n\nLEFT",
