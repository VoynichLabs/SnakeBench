Let me think about follow-up options from there:\n\nFrom (5,5) after eating:\n- UP to (5,6) - empty\n- DOWN to (5,4) - my new body, so not allowed\n- LEFT to (4,5) - empty  \n- RIGHT to (6,5) - empty\n\nSo I'd still have 3 safe moves after eating the apple, which keeps options open.\n\nThe apple at (5,5) is definitely reachable and beneficial. I should take it.\n\nUP",

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. My snake (ID 1) has its head at (9,4) and no body, so it's just the head. The enemy snake (ID 0) has its head at (5,4) and no body. Apples are at (8,9), (2,8), (5,5), (6,1), and (7,3).\n\nI'm at turn 0, and I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nMy current position is (9,4). Since I have no body, I don't have to worry about moving backwards into myself. But I do need to avoid moving into the enemy snake's body, but since the enemy also has no body, only its head matters for collision.\n\nImportant rules: all snakes move simultaneously. So, when I move, the enemy also moves. I need to consider where the enemy might move, but I don't know their strategy, so I have to assume they could move in any direction, but I should be cautious about potential head-on collisions.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid moving outside the board. The board goes from x=0 to x=9 and y=0 to y=9. My current x=9, so if I move RIGHT, I would go to x=10, which is outside, so that would kill me. So RIGHT is not an option.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP, I go to (9,5), which is within the board. DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4). So possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, I need to check if any of these moves would directly cause me to hit a snake body. Since I have no body and the enemy has no body, the only thing to check is if I move into the enemy's head, but since we move simultaneously, if I move into the enemy's current head position, but they also move, so it might not be a collision unless we both move into the same cell.\n\nThe rules say: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" So I need to consider where the enemy might move.\n\nBut I don't know where the enemy will move. So for safety, I should avoid moving towards the enemy's current head if possible, but since they might move away, it's not certain.\n\nFirst, let's list my safe moves:\n\n- UP: to (9,5)\n\n- DOWN: to (9,3)\n\n- LEFT: to (8,4)\n\nNow, I need to see if any of these are immediately dangerous. For example, if I move LEFT to (8,4), is there anything there? From the board state, at (8,4), it's empty? Let's look at the board:\n\nFrom the board string:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .  so (9,9) is A, (8,9) is A? No, let's parse the board correctly.\n\nThe board is shown with rows from y=9 down to y=0, and for each row, x from 0 to 9.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .  so at y=9, x=0 to 9: all dots except x=8 has A? Let's see: the string is \" . . . . . . . . A . \" which has 10 characters? Let's count: positions: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:.  so yes, at (8,9) there is an apple? But in the apple list, it says (8,9) is an apple, yes.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: . . A . . . . . . .  so at (2,8) there is an apple, which matches.\n\nRow 7: all dots? . . . . . . . . . .  so no apples.\n\nRow 6: all dots? . . . . . . . . . .  no apples.\n\nRow 5: . . . . . A . . . .  so at (5,5) there is an apple, but wait, the apples are at (5,5), so yes.\n\nBut in the board, row 5 is for y=5? Let's see the coordinate system: bottom left is (0,0), top right is (9,9). In the board, row 9 is the top row, so y=9, and row 0 is bottom y=0.\n\nSo for row 5: y=5, and the string is \" . . . . . A . . . . \" so x=0 to 9: at x=5, there is A? But apples are at (5,5), which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, row 4: \" . . . . . 0 . . . 1 \" so at x=5, y=4, there is snake #0, and at x=9, y=4, there is snake #1? But snake #1 head is at (9,4), yes.\n\nIn row 4, the string: \" . . . . . 0 . . . 1 \" so positions: x=0:., x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:0, x=6:., x=7:., x=8:., x=9:1? But in the snake list, snake #0 head is at (5,4), and snake #1 head is at (9,4), so yes, at (5,4) and (9,4).\n\nBut in the string, it shows \"0\" at x=5 and \"1\" at x=9, so that matches.\n\nNow, back to my moves.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,5): what is at (9,5)? From row 5: \" . . . . . A . . . . \" so at x=9, y=5, it's dot, so empty. But is there an apple? Apples are at (8,9), (2,8), (5,5), (6,1), (7,3). So (9,5) is not an apple. So moving UP to (9,5) is safe? But I need to see if the enemy might move there.\n\nSimilarly, move DOWN to (9,3): from row 3: \" . . . . . . . A . . \" so at x=9, y=3, it's dot? The string: \" . . . . . . . A . . \" so positions: x=0:., x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:A, x=8:., x=9:.? Let's see: it says \" . . . . . . . A . . \" which has 10 characters? Count: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.? But there are 10 characters, so x=7 is A, which is apple at (7,3), yes. So at (9,3), it's dot, so empty.\n\nMove LEFT to (8,4): from row 4, at x=8, it's dot? From the string: \" . . . . . 0 . . . 1 \" so after x=5:0, then x=6:., x=7:., x=8:., x=9:1. So at (8,4), it's dot, so empty.\n\nSo all three moves are to empty cells, so no immediate collision with snake bodies or apples? But apples are not dangerous, I can eat them, but since I'm moving, if I move to an apple, I grow, which is good, but I need to see if the cell has an apple.\n\nFrom the apple list, none of (9,5), (9,3), or (8,4) are apples. Apples are at (8,9), (2,8), (5,5), (6,1), (7,3). So no, I wouldn't eat an apple immediately with any of these moves.\n\nBut I should consider moving towards apples. For example, there is an apple at (8,9), which is close to my current position? My current head is (9,4), so (8,9) is left and up. Similarly, (5,5) is down and left, etc.\n\nBut since I'm at turn 0, I need to think about long-term strategy, but for now, I need to choose a move that keeps me alive and preferably moves me towards apples.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. The enemy is at (5,4), which is to my left, but at the same y-coordinate. So if I move LEFT towards (8,4), I might be moving closer to the enemy, but the enemy might move away.\n\nThe enemy has no body, so it can move in any direction without self-collision. But if I move LEFT to (8,4), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), then we are at (8,4) and (6,4), no collision. But if the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), and I move LEFT to (8,4), we are two cells apart, no problem.\n\nBut if the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), and I move LEFT to (8,4), then we are at (8,4) and (6,4), so the distance between us is 2 in x-direction, so no collision.\n\nBut if the enemy moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT, it might not come towards me.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the possibility of head-on collision. If I move to a cell, and the enemy also moves to that same cell, we both die. So I should avoid moving to cells that the enemy might target.\n\nBut since I don't know the enemy's move, I have to assume that moving towards the enemy might increase the risk of head-on collision, but it's not certain.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy might be moving towards apples too. The apples are at (8,9), (2,8), (5,5), (6,1), (7,3). From enemy's position at (5,4), the closest apples are (5,5) which is directly above, and (7,3) which is down and right, and (6,1) down and left, etc.\n\nSo the enemy might move UP to (5,5) to eat the apple immediately, since (5,5) has an apple? From the apple list, yes, (5,5) has an apple, and from the board, row 5 has A at x=5, so yes.\n\nSo if enemy moves UP to (5,5), it will eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut I need to decide my move without knowing what the enemy will do.\n\nI should also consider my own growth. Since I'm at turn 0, I need to start moving towards apples to collect points.\n\nNow, let's list the apples and their distances from my head (9,4):\n\n- (8,9): distance in Manhattan: |9-8| + |4-9| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- (2,8): |9-2| + |4-8| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- (6,1): |9-6| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (7,3): |9-7| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo the closest apple is (7,3) with distance 3, then (5,5) with distance 5, then (8,9) and (6,1) with distance 6, and (2,8) with 11.\n\nSo I should consider moving towards (7,3) first, as it's the closest.\n\n(7,3) is at x=7, y=3. From (9,4), to get to (7,3), I need to move left twice and down once, but since I move one step per turn, I can move LEFT or DOWN towards it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is at x=5, y=5, so I need to move left and up? From (9,4) to (5,5): \u0394x = -4, \u0394y = +1, so mostly left, slightly up.\n\nBut (7,3) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance, and it's only 3 steps away, so if I move directly towards it, I can reach it in 3 moves.\n\nBut I need to plan the path safely.\n\nFirst, for my immediate move, I need to choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT towards (7,3), I go to (8,4). From (8,4), the distance to (7,3) is |8-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2, so two moves away: I could move LEFT to (7,4) then DOWN to (7,3), or DOWN to (8,3) then LEFT to (7,3), etc.\n\nBut if I move LEFT to (8,4), that seems reasonable.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), that gets me closer to (7,3) as well? From (9,3) to (7,3) is |9-7| + |3-3| = 2, so two moves left, so similar to above.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,5), that is away from (7,3) but towards (5,5)? From (9,5) to (5,5) is |9-5| + |5-5| = 4, so still far, and I'm moving away from (7,3).\n\nSo moving UP seems less optimal for reaching the closest apple.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy. The enemy is at (5,4). If I move LEFT to (8,4), I am moving towards the enemy's general direction, but the enemy might move away. However, if the enemy moves RIGHT towards me, we might have a head-on collision if we meet in the middle.\n\nFor example, if I move LEFT to (8,4), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), then we are at (8,4) and (6,4), no collision. But if the enemy moves RIGHT to (5,4) to (6,4), then we are still apart.\n\nBut if both of us move LEFT and RIGHT respectively, we might not collide because we are moving towards each other but from different starting points.\n\nLet's see the positions: I am at (9,4), enemy at (5,4). If I move LEFT, I go to (8,4). If enemy moves RIGHT, it goes to (6,4). So we are at (8,4) and (6,4), which are two cells apart, so no collision.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,4), and enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), then on the next turn, if I move LEFT again to (7,4), and enemy moves RIGHT to (7,4), then we both move to (7,4) and die. So that is a risk.\n\nBut I don't know if the enemy will move RIGHT. The enemy might move UP to (5,5) to eat the apple, which is likely because it's directly above and has an apple.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (5,5), then from (5,4) to (5,5), so it goes to the apple, eats it, and grows. Then I am at (8,4) if I moved LEFT, so no collision.\n\nSo, if I move LEFT, and enemy moves UP, no problem.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), or LEFT to (4,4), etc., no collision.\n\nSo the risk of head-on collision is only if both of us move towards each other, which might not happen if the enemy goes for an apple.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (9,3), I am moving away from the enemy, so less chance of collision.\n\nBut moving DOWN to (9,3) takes me towards (7,3)? From (9,3) to (7,3) is directly left, so I can go left twice to reach (7,3). Whereas from (8,4), I need to go left once and down once to reach (7,3). So both are similar in terms of steps to (7,3).\n\nFrom (9,4) to (7,3): I need to decrease x by 2 and y by 1, so I can go left twice and down once, or down once and left twice, etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), then from there, I can move LEFT to (8,3) then LEFT to (7,3), so two moves left, but I need to move down only once, which I already did? From (9,4) to (9,3) is down, so from (9,3) to (7,3) is left twice, so total three moves: down, left, left? But I need to reach (7,3) in three moves, but from (9,4) to (7,3) is three moves: for example, left, left, down or left, down, left, etc. But if I move down first to (9,3), then from there to (7,3) is two left moves, so in two moves from (9,3), I can be at (7,3), so after my first move down, I am at (9,3), then on turn 2, I move left to (8,3), on turn 3, I move left to (7,3), so yes, I reach (7,3) on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT first to (8,4), then from (8,4) to (7,3) I need to move left and down, so on turn 2, I move left to (7,4) or down to (8,3), then on turn 3, I move to (7,3) from either, so also three moves.\n\nSo both paths take three moves to reach (7,3).\n\nBut from (9,4), if I move DOWN, I go to (9,3), which is closer to other apples? Let's see: (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, from (9,3) it's |9-6| + |3-1| = 3+2=5, while from (8,4) it's |8-6| + |4-1| = 2+3=5, so same.\n\nBut (7,3) is closer to both.\n\nNow, another apple is (5,5), which is at distance 5 from (9,4). If I move UP, I go to (9,5), distance to (5,5) is 4, so still far. But (5,5) is directly above the enemy, so the enemy might eat it first.\n\nSimilarly, there is an apple at (8,9), which is very high, so from my position, it might take many moves to reach, and the enemy might also go for it, but since it's at the top, and I'm at right side, it might be accessible.\n\nBut for now, since (7,3) is the closest, I should prioritize it.\n\nBut I need to ensure that I don't get trapped or put myself in a dangerous position.\n\nNow, let's consider the board boundaries. I am at x=9, the right edge. If I move LEFT, I go to x=8, which is inside. If I move DOWN, I go to y=3, which is inside. If I move UP, I go to y=5, inside.\n\nBut if I move LEFT, I might be moving towards the center, which is generally good because I have more space. If I stay on the edge, I might have fewer options later.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, I go to y=3, which is still in the lower half, but there is an apple at (7,3) and (6,1), so moving down might be good.\n\nBut let's think about the enemy's potential moves. The enemy is at (5,4). If it moves UP to (5,5), it eats the apple, so it will grow. That means its body will now have one segment behind it. So after eating, if it moves UP, its body will be at (5,4) and head at (5,5). So then on subsequent turns, it has to be careful not to move into its own body.\n\nBut for now, at turn 0, it might move UP.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,4), and enemy moves UP to (5,5), then I am at (8,4), and I can continue towards (7,3) without issue.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), and enemy moves UP, same thing.\n\nNow, another factor: if I move LEFT, I might be able to go for multiple apples. For example, from (8,4), I can go to (7,3) to eat the apple, then from there, I can go to (6,1) or (5,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, from (9,3), I can go to (7,3) directly left, or to (6,1) down and left.\n\nBut from (9,3), to go to (6,1), I need to move left three times and down twice, so more moves.\n\nWhereas from (8,4), to go to (7,3) is one left and one down, then to (6,1) is one left and two down, etc.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think both LEFT and DOWN are reasonable, but I need to see if one is safer.\n\nAnother thing: the board has obstacles? Only snakes and apples, but since snakes have no body yet, only heads matter for collision.\n\nBut if I move to a cell where the enemy might move, I die. So I should avoid moving to cells that are directly towards the enemy's head if the enemy might move towards me.\n\nBut since the enemy might not move towards me, I shouldn't assume that.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possible moves of the enemy and see if any of my moves lead to certain death.\n\nFor example, if I move LEFT to (8,4), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), no problem. If enemy moves UP to (5,5), no problem. If enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), no problem. If enemy moves LEFT to (4,4), no problem. So for all enemy moves, when I am at (8,4), there is no collision because the enemy is at least 2 cells away in x-direction? When I am at (8,4), enemy at (5,4) or (6,4) etc., so x-coordinate difference is at least 2, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (9,3), enemy at (5,4) or (6,4) etc., so y-coordinate difference is at least 1, and x difference at least 4, so no collision.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,5), enemy at (5,4), so difference in x=4, y=1, so no collision.\n\nSo all three moves are safe from immediate head-on collision? But head-on collision only if both move to the same cell. Since I am moving to (8,4), (9,3), or (9,5), and the enemy is moving from (5,4) to one of four directions, so the possible cells enemy can reach are (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), (4,4). None of these are the same as my new positions: (8,4), (9,3), (9,5). So for this turn, no matter what the enemy does, if I move to any of these three, I won't collide with the enemy's head this turn.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see: my new position: (8,4), (9,3), or (9,5). Enemy's possible new positions: (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), (4,4). None match my new positions. So yes, all three moves are safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\nSo I don't have to worry about that for this move.\n\nNow, the only other thing is that moving into a cell with an apple is good, but as established, none of these cells have apples, so no issue.\n\nSo all three moves are safe in terms of immediate death.\n\nNow, I need to choose which one to prefer based on future options and apple access.\n\nAs I thought, moving towards the closest apple (7,3) is good. Both LEFT and DOWN move me towards (7,3), while UP moves me away.\n\nBut UP moves me towards (5,5), which is the next closest apple, but (5,5) is farther than (7,3) from my current position? From (9,4), to (5,5) is 5 steps, to (7,3) is 3 steps, so (7,3) is closer.\n\nMoreover, (5,5) is directly above the enemy, so the enemy might eat it first. If the enemy moves UP now, it will eat (5,5) this turn, so by the time I get there, it might be gone. So it might not be available for me.\n\nWhereas (7,3) is not directly above the enemy; it's at (7,3), which is south-east of the enemy? Enemy at (5,4), so (7,3) is right and down, so not directly in the enemy's path unless the enemy moves towards it.\n\nBut the enemy might not go for (7,3) immediately if it goes for (5,5).\n\nSo likely, (7,3) might be available for me.\n\nSimilarly, other apples like (8,9) and (6,1) are farther.\n\nSo I should aim for (7,3).\n\nNow, between LEFT and DOWN, which is better?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,4), from there I can move towards (7,3) by going LEFT or DOWN, depending on the situation.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), from there I can move towards (7,3) by going LEFT twice, or towards (6,1) by going DOWN and LEFT, etc.\n\nBut from (8,4), I have more options because I can go to (7,4), (8,3), (9,4) but I just came from (9,4), so going back might not be good, but technically possible.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,3), I can go to (9,4), (9,2), (8,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the space around me.\n\nFrom (9,4), if I move LEFT to (8,4), I have neighbors: (7,4), (8,3), (8,5), (9,4). (9,4) is where I was, so I shouldn't go back, but it's possible. (8,5) is empty? From board, at (8,5)? Row 5: \" . . . . . A . . . . \" so at x=8, y=5, it's dot, so empty. (7,4) is dot? Row 4: at x=7, from string \" . . . . . 0 . . . 1 \" so after x=5:0, then x=6:., x=7:., so yes, (7,4) is empty. (8,3) from row 3: at x=8, from string \" . . . . . . . A . . \" so after x=7:A, then x=8:., x=9:., so yes, empty.\n\nSo from (8,4), I have multiple safe directions: LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (8,3), UP to (8,5), or BACK to (9,4) which is not preferred.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), from there, neighbors: (9,4) where I was, (9,2), (8,3), (10,3) which is out of board, so only three directions: UP to (9,4), DOWN to (9,2), LEFT to (8,3).\n\nSo from (9,3), I have only three directions, but one is back, so effectively two new directions: DOWN to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,3).\n\nFrom (8,4), I have three new directions: LEFT to (7,4), DOWN to (8,3), UP to (8,5).\n\nSo from (8,4), I have more options than from (9,3). From (9,3), I have only two new directions, while from (8,4), I have three.\n\nMoreover, from (8,4), I can directly move towards (7,3) by going LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT, etc.\n\nFrom (9,3), I can move LEFT to (8,3) then LEFT to (7,3), so also towards (7,3).\n\nBut from (8,4), I am closer to (7,3) in terms of Manhattan distance? From (8,4) to (7,3) is 2, from (9,3) to (7,3) is 2 as well, so same.\n\nBut from (8,4), I can reach (7,3) in two moves: e.g., LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT. From (9,3), I can reach (7,3) in two moves: LEFT then LEFT, but that would be to (8,3) then (7,3), so yes, two moves.\n\nBut from (9,3), if I move LEFT to (8,3), then from there to (7,3) is one move LEFT, so after two moves from (9,3), I can be at (7,3).\n\nSimilarly, from (8,4), after one move LEFT to (7,4), then one move DOWN to (7,3), so two moves as well.\n\nSo no difference in speed.\n\nBut from (8,4), I have the option to go UP to (8,5), which might lead to other apples, but (8,9) is far, so not immediately useful.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,3), going DOWN to (9,2) might lead to (6,1) or other apples, but (6,1) is at y=1, so from y=3, I can go down to y=2, then to y=1, etc.\n\nBut let's see if there are any apples near (9,3)? No, the closest is (7,3) and (6,1), etc.\n\nAnother thing: if I move DOWN to (9,3), I am moving towards the bottom edge, which might reduce my space if I go too low, but since the board is 10x10, I have plenty of space.\n\nBut from a strategic point, moving to the center might be better because it gives more flexibility. (8,4) is closer to the center than (9,3)? The center would be around (4.5,4.5), so (8,4) is still on the right, but less so than (9,4). (9,3) is on the right and lower, so perhaps more towards the corner.\n\nBut since I'm at turn 0, it might not matter much yet.\n\nNow, considering the enemy's position: if I move LEFT to (8,4), I am moving towards the enemy's x-coordinate, but since the enemy might move away, it's fine. If I move DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy in y-direction, but since the enemy is at y=4, and I go to y=3, so slightly away.\n\nBut again, no immediate issue.\n\nI think both are good, but perhaps moving LEFT is slightly better because I am moving towards the center and towards multiple apples? From (8,4), I can go to (7,3) which is south-west, or to (5,5) which is north-west, but (5,5) is farther, and I might not need to go there if the enemy eats it.\n\nBut let's see the apple at (6,1). From (8,4), to (6,1) is |8-6| + |4-1| = 2+3=5, while from (9,3) to (6,1) is |9-6| + |3-1| = 3+2=5, so same.\n\nFrom (8,4), after eating (7,3), I might go to (6,1) or to (2,8) etc., but (2,8) is far.\n\nAnother apple: (8,9) is at top right, from (8,4), it's straight up, distance |8-8| + |4-9| = 0+5=5, so I can go up from (8,4) to (8,5), (8,6), etc., to (8,9). So that might be a path.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,3), I can go up to (9,4), (9,5), etc., but (9,9) has no apple? From board, row 9 has apple at (8,9), not (9,9), so at (9,9) it's dot. So from (9,3), going up to (9,9) doesn't have an apple, but I can go left to (8,9) eventually.\n\nBut from (8,4), I am directly below (8,9), so I can go up to (8,9) in 5 moves, and eat that apple.\n\nSimilarly, from (9,3), I need to go up to (9,9) then left to (8,9), so more moves.\n\nSo from (8,4), accessing (8,9) is easier than from (9,3).\n\nBut (8,9) is far, and I might not need to go there immediately since there are closer apples.\n\nBut for long-term, it might be useful.\n\nNow, back to the closest apple (7,3). I think I should focus on that first.\n\nNow, between LEFT and DOWN, I think LEFT to (8,4) is slightly better because it gives me more immediate options and moves me towards the center.\n\nAlso, if I move LEFT, I am not moving directly away from any apple, whereas if I move DOWN, I am moving away from (8,9) and (5,5) but towards (7,3) and (6,1), so it's fine.\n\nBut let's see the board state for traps. Since there are no bodies yet, no traps are present.\n\nBut after a few turns, when snakes grow, traps might form.\n\nFor now, I think LEFT is a good move.\n\nI could consider moving DOWN to (9,3) to be closer to (6,1) and (7,3), but (7,3) is at y=3, so from (9,3), I am at the same y-level, so I can go left directly.\n\nBut from (8,4), I am at y=4, so I need to go down to y=3 for (7,3).\n\nBut since (7,3) is at y=3, from (9,3) I am already at y=3, so I can go left to x=7 directly, which might be faster? From (9,3) to (7,3) is two left moves, so after two moves, I am there. From (8,4) to (7,3) is one left and one down, so also two moves. So same.\n\nBut from (9,3), if I move left to (8,3), then left to (7,3), so yes.\n\nHowever, from (9,3), if I move left to (8,3), then from there I can move to (7,3) or to (8,2) etc., but no apple at (8,3).\n\nWhereas from (8,4), if I move down to (8,3), then from there I can move to (7,3) or to (8,2) etc., similar.\n\nBut from (8,4), I have the option to move up to (8,5), which might be useful if I need to avoid something.\n\nAnother point: the enemy snake might move in a way that blocks my path. For example, if I move LEFT to (8,4), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), then on the next turn, if I move LEFT to (7,4), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,4), we collide. But that depends on the enemy's move, which I don't control.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (9,3), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), then no collision, and I can move LEFT to (8,3), etc.\n\nBut since the enemy might go for the apple at (5,5), it might not move towards me.\n\nSo, I think the risk is low.\n\nI recall that in Snake games, it's often good to move towards the center to have more options, and to avoid edges where you might get trapped.\n\nSo, moving LEFT from the right edge towards the center seems good.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the move: LEFT from (9,4) to (8,4).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan, I should write a rationale for myself.\n\nSo, for the next turn, I need to remember that I am going towards (7,3) apple.\n\nSo, my plan: \"Move towards the closest apple at (7,3). Avoid the enemy snake and consider growing quickly to gain points.\"\n\nBut since the enemy might also be growing, I need to be efficient.\n\nBut for now, for this move, I choose LEFT.\n\nFinally, I need to output only one word: LEFT\n\nBut in the response, I should have my reasoning before that.\n\nSo, let's summarize myI am at (9,4) with no body, so I need to avoid moving off the board or into another snake. Moving RIGHT is impossible because it would take me off the board. Moving UP, DOWN, or LEFT are all safe moves since they land on empty cells and won't cause immediate collision with the enemy head this turn, as the enemy is at (5,4) and can only reach (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), or (4,4).\n\nAmong the safe moves, I prioritize moving towards the closest apple, which is at (7,3) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Moving LEFT to (8,4) keeps me on a path to reach (7,3) in two more moves (e.g., LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT). This move also increases my flexibility by moving toward the center of the board, providing more options for future turns. Moving DOWN to (9,3) is also viable but offers fewer immediate directions and moves me away from other apples like (8,9). Moving UP to (9,5) moves me away from (7,3) and toward (5,5), but the enemy is more likely to eat (5,5) first, so it's less efficient.\n\nThus, LEFT is the best choice to approach the closest apple while maintaining safety and future mobility.\n\nLong-term plan: Head toward (7,3) to eat the closest apple, then assess other apples while avoiding the enemy and staying in open spaces.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "My head is currently at (7, 4). My body is empty, so I cannot collide with myself.\nI need to check the immediate board boundaries and snake body positions for the four possible moves:\n- UP to (7, 5): The board description shows a 'T' at (5, 5) which represents the tail of Snake #0. The body coordinates provided for Snake #0 are [(5, 5)]. Therefore, moving to (7, 5) is a safe empty cell.\n- DOWN to (7, 3): There is an apple at (7, 3). This is a valid move.\n- LEFT to (6, 4): Empty cell.\n- RIGHT to (8, 4): Empty cell.\n\nAll four moves are currently safe from immediate obstacles.\n\nNext, I consider the enemy snake. Snake #0 is at (4, 5) with body at (5, 5). Its head is at (4, 5). In the next turn, it could move to (4, 6), (4, 4), (3, 5), or (5, 5). (5, 5) is its own tail, but since it has just eaten (it has 1 apple), the tail will not move away immediately if it moves forward. However, strictly speaking, moving into the body of the snake in front of the head is usually fatal, but since it is the tail, it might be safe. Regardless, I should avoid its potential head movement.\n\nI want to collect apples to win. The closest apples are at (7, 3) and (6, 1).\nMoving DOWN to (7, 3) allows me to eat an apple immediately.\nMoving LEFT to (6, 4) positions me at x=6, y=4. From there, I can move DOWN twice to reach (6, 2) and then (6, 1) for another apple, or move DOWN to (6, 3) then LEFT to (5, 3) etc. However, DOWN to (7, 3) is the most direct path to an apple.\n\nSafety check for DOWN to (7, 3):\nI will eat the apple. My tail will stay at (7, 4) for this turn (since I just moved from there and grew).\nPotential moves for Enemy #0:\n- (4, 4): This is far from (7, 3).\n- (5, 5): This is its tail, safe for it, and far from me.\n- (4, 6) or (3, 5): Far.\nSo DOWN is safe and gains a point immediately.\n\nSafety check for LEFT to (6, 4):\nNo apple. My tail will stay at (7, 4).\nThis is also safe.\n\nSafety check for UP to (7, 5):\nNo apple. My tail will stay at (7, 4).\nIs (7, 5) safe from enemy? Enemy is at (4, 5). Distance is 3 horizontally. If enemy moves RIGHT twice (impossible in one turn), it would hit me. But it can only move 1 step. So (7, 5) is safe.\n\nSafety check for RIGHT to (8, 4):\nNo apple. My tail stays at (7, 4).\nThis is also safe.\n\nStrategy:\nSince I am at 0 apples and Snake #0 is at 1 apple, I need to close the gap.\nThe apple at (7, 3) is adjacent. Taking it is the best immediate move to improve my score and keep the game competitive.\nI should avoid moving UP towards (5, 5) or (4, 5) since that is where the enemy is. The enemy is currently at (4, 5). If I go UP to (7, 5), I am on the same y-level. While safe distance now, the enemy might move towards me in future turns. Eating the apple at (7, 3) puts me closer to the bottom and left side of the board, which seems relatively open.\nAlso, looking at the apples at (2, 8) and (8, 9), being at (7, 3) puts me closer to (8, 9) than (4, 5) does.\n\nDecision:\nMove DOWN to (7, 3) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

There is an apple at (6, 1) one step away from (7, 2) (via LEFT). Moving DOWN keeps me in the relatively clear bottom area.\n- **LEFT (6, 3):** Moves me closer to the apple at (6, 1). From (6, 3), I can go DOWN to (6, 2) then DOWN to (6, 1). Also puts me directly under the apple at (6, 9).

From (8, 3), I can go UP, UP, UP... but I must be wary of the enemy snake at (4, 6) who is also moving towards the top right (apples at (8,9) and (4,8)). Engaging in a race to (8,9) might be risky.\n\nComparing LEFT and DOWN:\nLEFT (6, 3) positions me directly below the path to (6, 9) and (8, 9) if I go left then up. It also keeps me closer to the apple at (6, 1).\nDOWN (7, 2) moves me slightly away from the top apples but closer to (6, 1) (diagonal).\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT:\nLEFT moves me away from the enemy snake who is at x=4. The enemy is likely moving towards the top right based on apple distribution. By going LEFT to x=6, I am positioning myself better for the apples at (6,1), (6,9), (8,9) without immediately challenging the enemy for the (4,8) apple.\n\nI will choose **LEFT** to (6, 3). This aligns me with the apple at (6, 1) and puts me in a good column to sweep up apples on the left side of the board (like (2,8)) or go for (6,9) later.

Not occupied by the enemy body (4,6). The enemy head is at (4,7).\n    -   **Risk:** The enemy snake is currently at (4,7) with an apple at (4,8) directly above it. It is highly probable that the enemy will move UP to (4,8) to eat that apple.\n    -   **Outcome:** If I go UP to (6,4) and the enemy goes UP to (4,8), we survive. If the enemy moves elsewhere, we survive. This move seems safe from immediate collision (unless the enemy moves DOWN to (4,6) which is its body, or runs into me, which is unlikely).\n    -   **Strategic Value:** This moves me closer to the cluster of apples at the top right ((8,9) and (6,9)). It maintains a distance of 4 steps to (6,9).\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):**\n    -   **Safety:** Inside the board. Not occupied by me. Not occupied by enemy.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** This moves me towards the apple at (6,1). From (6,2), (6,1) is one step DOWN. This is a \"low-hanging fruit\". However, the board state shows an apple at (6,1) and I am at (6,3). The path is clear. Securing this apple is very likely if I commit to it.\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):**\n    -   **Safety:** Inside the board. Not occupied.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** This moves me away from the top apples (8,9) and (6,9) and towards the empty space or the apple at (2,8). It keeps me away from the enemy snake (which is at x=4), potentially reducing conflict, but also moves me away from the apple-rich top right.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):**\n    -   **Safety:** The cell (7,3) is currently occupied by my body! The list is `[(7, 3)]`.\n    -   **Outcome:** Moving here would be moving into my own body. **DEAD**.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nBetween **UP (6, 4)**, **DOWN (6, 2)**, and **LEFT (5, 3)**:\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 3):** Moves away from the density of apples. The closest apples are at (6,1), (4,8), (6,9). Moving left takes me away from (6,9) and (4,8) (indirectly). It is safe but probably the least rewarding.\n*   **UP (6, 4):** Moves me towards (6,9) and (8,9). This is a good long-term direction. The enemy is at (4,7) and might try to block or race for (8,9). However, I am at x=6, they are at x=4. I have a positional advantage for (6,9) and (8,9).\n*   **DOWN (6, 2):** Moves me towards (6,1). This is a safe, guaranteed apple path. From (6,2), I can eat (6,1) next turn. After eating (6,1), I will grow and be at (6,1). From there, I have a clear shot to turn around and head UP towards the top apples, or potentially cross the board to the left side (2,8). Securing the (6,1) apple now increases my score to 2, putting me ahead of the enemy (who might miss their apple if they hesitate or get blocked).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (4,7). The apple at (4,8) is directly above it. I don't know the enemy's algorithm, but it's logical for them to eat that apple if safe. I am at (6,3). My best immediate value is securing the (6,1) apple.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (6,2), I am one step away from an apple.\nIf I go **UP** to (6,4), I am 5 steps away from (6,9).\nThe \"score now\" strategy suggests taking the (6,1) apple. The path is clear, and I don't have to worry about the enemy snake immediately.\n\nLet's double check the \"backwards\" rule. My tail is at (7,3). My head is at (6,3). If I went LEFT to (5,3), that's fine. If I went UP/DOWN, fine. If I went RIGHT to (7,3), that's my body. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nLet's verify the UP move safety again. Enemy at (4,7). If Enemy goes UP to (4,8), we don't collide. If Enemy goes RIGHT to (5,7), safe. If Enemy goes LEFT to (3,7), safe. If Enemy goes DOWN to (4,6) (its body), it dies. We are safe regardless. However, if I go UP and the Enemy goes UP (to 4,8), we are both moving. No collision.\n\nWhy choose DOWN over UP?\nGoing DOWN guarantees an apple next turn (Turn 5).\nGoing UP sets me up for a potential apple later (Turn 6+).\nIn Snake, taking guaranteed points now is usually better than chasing distant points, especially early game. Also, moving UP puts me in the \"danger zone\" where the enemy is active (near x=4). Moving DOWN puts me in a safer, open area (x=6, y=1-2).\n\nWait, looking at the board state:\n`6 . . . . T . . . . .`\n`5 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`4 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`3 . . . . . . 1 T . .`\n`2 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`1 . . . . . . A . . .`\n\nMy body is at (7,3). My head is at (6,3).\nMoving DOWN to (6,2) is clear.\nMoving DOWN to (6,2) gets me one step closer to (6,1).\nI will plan to move DOWN now, then DOWN again next turn to eat (6,1).\n\nLet's review the enemy.\nEnemy Head: (4, 7)\nEnemy Body: [(4, 6)]\nApples near enemy: (4, 8) directly above. (2, 8) is also nearby.\nThe enemy will likely move UP to (4,8).\nIf I move DOWN to (6,2), I am moving away from the enemy.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nIf I go UP to (6,4), I am moving towards (6,9).\nIf I go UP, I might encounter the enemy if they move erratically, but it's unlikely.\nHowever, if I go UP, I am not getting an apple this turn.\nIf I go DOWN, I am setting up for an apple next turn.\nThe apple at (6,1) is the closest and safest.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Race\" to the top.\nEnemy is at (4,7). I am at (6,3).\nIf I go UP, I stay at x=6.\nIf Enemy goes UP to (4,8) and then eventually moves towards (6,9), they have to travel from x=4 to x=6.\nI am at x=6. I have an advantage for (6,9).\nBut securing (6,1) first puts me at 2 apples vs 1 (or potentially 2 if enemy eats (4,8)).\nIt's better to guarantee the lead.\n\nFinal check on DOWN (6,2):\n- Board limit: y=2 is valid (0-9).\n- Self: My body is at (7,3). (6,2) is not me.\n- Enemy: Enemy is at (4,7) and (4,6). (6,2) is not them.\n- Outcome: Safe.\n\nFinal check on UP (6,4):\n- Board limit: Valid.\n- Self: Safe.\n- Enemy: Safe.\n- Outcome: Safe.\n\nFinal check on LEFT (5,3):\n- Safe.\n\nFinal check on RIGHT (7,3):\n- Unsafe (Self).\n\nDecision: I will go DOWN to secure the (6,1) apple.\n\nWait, is there a snake at (6,3)? Yes, my head.\nIs there a snake at (7,3)? Yes, my body.\nIs there a snake at (4,7)? Yes, enemy head.\nIs there a snake at (4,6)? Yes, enemy body.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nOne more thought: The enemy might move DOWN?\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4,6), they hit their own body and die. They are unlikely to do that.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT/RIGHT, they don't get the apple at (4,8).\nSo they probably go UP.\nThis leaves me free to go DOWN.\n\nI will write a short plan for the next turn.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (6,2) to position for the apple at (6,1). Next turn, move DOWN to (6,1) to eat the apple. After eating, I will be at (6,1) with a length of 4. From there, I will turn UP towards the apples at (6,9) or (8,9).\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\nDouble check the coordinate system.\n\"Decreasing your y coordinate is down\".\nI am at y=3. (6,3).\nIf I go DOWN, y becomes 2. (6,2).\nThe apple is at (6,1).\nIf I go DOWN to (6,2), next turn I go DOWN to (6,1) to eat.\nThis is correct.\n\nLet's verify the \"Head to Tail\" order of my body.\n\"Head: (6, 3), Body: [(7, 3)]\"\nSo the snake is:\nHead: (6,3)\nBody 1: (7,3)\n(Tail is implicitly the last body part, currently (7,3)).\nWait, normally the tail moves every turn unless eaten.\nPrevious turn I was at (7,3) and ate an apple.\nMy body was [(7,4)].\nI moved LEFT to (6,3).\nMy body became [(7,3)].\nThe tail was (7,4), but because I ate, it stayed.\nSo the full snake last turn was: Head (6,3), Body (7,3), Tail (7,4).\nWait, the prompt says: \"Body: [(7, 3)]\".\nThis implies the tail is (7,3) and I didn't eat?\n\"Apples collected: 1\".\n\"My last move: LEFT\".\n\"If you move onto an apple, you grow\".\nDid I eat an apple last turn?\nLast turn: Head at (7,3).\nApples: (8, 9), (2, 8), (6, 1), (4, 8), (6, 9).\n(7,3) is not an apple.\nSo I did NOT eat last turn.\nI just moved LEFT from (7,3) to (6,3).\nSo the tail should have moved.\nIf I was at (7,3) with body [(7,4)] (as the rationale said), and I moved LEFT to (6,3), the tail (7,4) moves to (7,3).\nSo the new body is [(7,3)].\nThis matches the prompt: \"Body: [(7, 3)]\".\nSo I did NOT eat last turn.\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 1\".\nAnd \"Apples collected: 1\".\nSo I have 1 apple total.\nThe previous rationale said: \"I have just eaten an apple\".\nThat rationale was from turn 3 (my last move).\nBut the board state shows no apple at (7,3).\nSo the previous rationale might have been slightly hallucinating about eating, OR the game state provided is consistent with NOT eating.\nLet's re-read the previous turn info.\n\"Turn: 4\".\n\"Last move information: ... LEFT\".\n\"Current turn: 3. My head is at (7, 3). I have just eaten an apple...\"\nThis is a contradiction in the provided data.\nHowever, I must use the CURRENT game state provided.\nCurrent State:\nHead: (6, 3)\nBody: [(7, 3)]\nThis means the tail is (7, 3).\nThis implies the snake length is 2 (Head + Body).\nIf I had eaten, the tail would not have moved, so the body would be [(7, 3), (7, 4)] (or similar). But it's just [(7, 3)].\nSo I did NOT eat.\nMeaning the apple is NOT at (7,3).\nTherefore, moving to (6,2) is not eating yet.\nI am going to (6,2) to be adjacent to (6,1).\n\nOne final check on safety.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,2), is it safe?\nYes.\nIs there any reason to fear the enemy?\nEnemy is at (4,7). They are far away.\nThey will likely go UP to (4,8).\n\nSo the plan stands.\n\nStrategy Note for next turn:\n\"I am moving DOWN to (6,2) to prepare to eat the apple at (6,1) next turn. Watch out for the enemy snake at (4,7) who is likely moving UP to (4,8). After eating, turn UP towards (6,9).\"\n\nMove: DOWN\n\nWait, I should check if (6,2) is adjacent to any other apples or threats.\nApples: (8, 9), (2, 8), (6, 1), (4, 8), (6, 9).\nNone at (6,2).\nIt's safe.\n\nOne edge case: Could the enemy snake at (4,7) turn LEFT to (3,7) and then eventually come down?\nYes, but that's many turns away.\nCould the enemy snake at (4,7) turn RIGHT to (5,7)?\nYes. Still safe for me.\n\nI am confident in DOWN.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't move into the enemy body if they move.\nBut they are at y=7. I am at y=3.\nWe are separated by 4 rows.\nEven if they move DOWN 4 times, they won't hit me this turn.\nSo it's safe.\n\nFinal check: \"Do not add anything after that word\".\n\"DOWN\"\n\nOne small detail: The enemy has an apple at (4,8). If they take it, they grow. That increases their length. But I can't stop them.\nMy priority is to grow.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 1\".\nSo I have 1 apple.\nThe enemy has 1 apple.\nThe board has 5 apples.\nThis is early game.\nTaking (6,1) is a solid move.\n\nDouble check the board coordinates.\nBottom left is (0,0).\nTop right is (9,9).\nRow 9 is top.\nRow 0 is bottom.\nColumns 0 to 9.\nMy head (6,3) is at column 6, row 3.\n(6,1) is at column 6, row 1.\nSo (6,1) is below (6,3).\nSo moving DOWN is correct.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN.\n\nWait, I noticed a detail in the \"Board state\":\n`3 . . . . . . 1 T . .`\n`6 . . . . T . . . . .`\n\nRow 3 has \"1 T\".\nRow 6 has \"T\".\n\nWait, looking closely at the board text provided:\n` 9 . . . . . . A . A .`\n` 8 . . A . A . . . . .`\n` 7 . . . . 0 . . . . .`\n` 6 . . . . T . . . . .`\n` 5 . . . . . . . . . .`\n` 4 . . . . . . . . . .`\n` 3 . . . . . . 1 T . .`\n\nWait, in row 3: `1 T`.\nThe prompt says: \"Head: (6, 3), Body: [(7, 3)]\".\nSo at (6,3) is '1' (Head).\nAt (7,3) is 'T' (Tail).\nThis confirms my body is at (7,3).\n\nIn row 6: ` . . . . T . . . . .`\nColumn 4 is 'T'. (4,6).\nThis is the enemy body (Tail).\nThe enemy head is at (4,7).\nThis matches the prompt \"Snake #0 - Head: (4, 7), Body: [(4, 6)]\".\n\nSo the board state is consistent.\n\nMy move DOWN to (6,2):\nRow 2 in the board is: ` 2 . . . . . . . . . .`\nThis row is empty.\nSo (6,2) is indeed empty.\n\nI am safe to move DOWN.\n\nFinal Answer:\nDOWNDOWN",

However, the current board state and my last move rationale indicate I was targeting the apple at (6, 1). The board state shows \"1\" at (6, 1), which is typically the head position. Since the apple at (6, 1) is missing and I was planning to eat it, I must have moved to (6, 1). The discrepancy in the body position in the text description is likely a lag or error in the provided state. I will trust the board state and the fact that the apple at (6, 1) is gone.\n\nI am currently at (6, 1). The apple at (6, 1) has been eaten. My body is supposedly at (6, 2) and (6, 3) if I grew. If I did not grow, my body is at (6, 2) and (6, 3), and I just passed through (6, 1). But usually, you eat and grow. Let's assume I ate the apple and grew.\nMy possible moves from (6, 1):\n- UP: (6, 2). This is my previous head position (if I moved from (6, 2) to (6, 1)) or my body (if I was at (6, 2)). Wait, my body was [(6, 2), (6, 3)]. If I am at (6, 1), my body occupies (6, 2) and (6, 3). Moving UP to (6, 2) hits my own body. This is a suicide move.\n- DOWN: (6, 0). This is within the board. It is empty on the board view.\n- LEFT: (5, 1). The board view shows 'A' at (5, 1). This is an apple.\n- RIGHT: (7, 1). The board view shows '.' at (7, 1). This is empty.\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and stay alive.\n- Moving UP kills me.\n- Moving LEFT gets an apple. However, I must check for safety. If I move to (5, 1), my tail will move from (6, 3) to (6, 2). The new head is (5, 1). I need to check if anyone else moves there. The enemy snake is far away. The only risk is if I trap myself later.\n- Moving RIGHT is safe and moves me towards other apples? No, apples are at (2, 8), (6, 9), (8, 9), (0, 5). (5, 1) is an immediate apple.\n- Moving DOWN is safe.\n\nIs there a reason not to take (5, 1)? It's an immediate point. My body is at (6, 2) and (6, 3). After eating (5, 1), my body becomes [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)] (assuming I was at (6, 1)). Wait, if I just moved to (6, 1), my old head was (6, 2). So my body is (6, 2), (6, 3). If I eat at (5, 1), I grow. My new body will be (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3). My head is (5, 1).\nNeighbors of (5, 1):\n- (4, 1): Empty\n- (6, 1): My body\n- (5, 0): Empty\n- (5, 2): Empty\nSo (5, 1) is safe now and leaves good options.\n\nLet's look at the long-term plan. I want to go to (6, 9) and (8, 9). That requires moving UP eventually. But I am at y=1. (5, 1) is left. (6, 1) is head.\nWait, let's re-verify the turn number. Turn 6. My last move was DOWN. I was at (6, 3). Target was (6, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I have eaten the apple. The board shows the apple is gone.\nMy body is currently: (6, 2), (6, 3). (I haven't grown yet in the provided \"current\" state, but if I am at (6, 1) and the apple is gone, I grew. Let's assume the state provided is \"pre-move\" but I am already at the new spot, or I just arrived.\nLet's assume I am at (6, 1). The apple at (6, 1) is gone.\nMoves:\nUP: (6, 2). My body is there. DEAD.\nDOWN: (6, 0). Safe.\nLEFT: (5, 1). Apple there. Safe.\nRIGHT: (7, 1). Safe.\n\nWhy did I move DOWN?\nLast turn I said: \"Move DOWN to (6, 2) to position for the apple at (6, 1). I will secure the apple on the next turn.\"\nSo I moved to (6, 2). Now I am at (6, 2)? No, the prompt says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nWait, if I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2), then my head is (6, 2).\nIf the prompt says \"Head: (6, 1)\", it means I moved again, or the turn advanced.\nActually, looking at the prompt structure:\n\"Turn: 6 / 150\"\n\"My snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 1)...\"\n\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"\nThis implies that in Turn 5, I chose DOWN. The result of Turn 5 is the state at Turn 6.\nIf I was at (6, 3) and moved DOWN, I end up at (6, 2).\nWhy is my head (6, 1)? Maybe I ate the apple?\nIf I was at (6, 2) and there was an apple at (6, 1), I couldn't have eaten it yet.\nUnless the apple was at (6, 2)?\n\"Apples at: ... (6, 1) ... 1 . . . . . . A 1 . .\"\nWait, the apple at (6, 1) is marked 'A'.\n\"1 . . . . . . A 1 . .\"\nRow 1: (0,1) to (9,1).\nx=0: .\n...\nx=6: A (This is the apple)\nx=7: 1 (This is my head? Or the tail?)\nWait, \"1 . . . . . . A 1 . .\"\n(6,1) is 'A'.\n(7,1) is '1'.\nIf '1' is my head, I am at (7, 1).\nBut the text says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nThere is a contradiction between the board representation and the text summary.\nLet's look closely at the board row 1:\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIndex 0 is '1'. Index 6 is 'A'. Index 7 is '1'.\nRow 1 corresponds to Y=1.\nX=0: '.' (Empty)\n...\nX=6: 'A' (Apple)\nX=7: '1' (Snake 1)\nSo the board shows my head at (7, 1).\nThe text summary says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nUsually, I trust the text summary of the state if it's explicit.\nLet's check the body in text: \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nIf head is (6, 1), body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf head is (7, 1), body would be...\nLet's assume the text summary is correct: Head (6, 1), Body [(6, 2), (6, 3)].\nIf Head is (6, 1), then I am standing on the apple.\nThis means I just moved to (6, 1) and ate it.\nBut my last move was DOWN (from 6,3 to 6,2).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I must have moved DOWN twice? Impossible in one turn.\nMaybe I moved to (6, 2) and the state provided is \"pre-move\" for turn 6?\n\"Turn: 6\"\n\"Head: (6, 1)\"\nIf I am at (6, 1), I have definitely eaten the apple at (6, 1).\nLet's check the apples list: \"Apples at: (8, 9), (2, 8), (6, 9), (0, 5), (5, 1)\".\nIt does NOT list (6, 1). So the apple at (6, 1) is gone.\nI must be at (6, 1).\nMy body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)].\nSo I arrived at (6, 1).\nMy previous position was (6, 2).\nMy move was DOWN (from 6,3 to 6,2) in the previous turn.\nThis means the \"Last Move\" info is from Turn 5.\nTurn 5: I was at (6, 3). I moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nTurn 6 state: Head (6, 1). This implies I moved DOWN again?\nNo, if I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2), I am at (6, 2) at start of Turn 6.\nBut the board state shows the game state at the START of my decision for Turn 6.\nIf the apple at (6, 1) is gone, and I am at (6, 1), I moved there.\nThis implies the \"Last Move\" info is wrong or I am misinterpreting \"Turn\".\nLet's re-read carefully.\n\"Turn: 6 / 150\"\n\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"\n\"My snake (ID: 1): ... Head: (6, 1)...\"\nUsually, \"Turn N\" means you are making the move for Turn N.\nThe state provided is the state AFTER Turn N-1.\nSo, Turn 6 means I am about to make my 6th move.\nThe state is the result of Turn 5.\nMy move in Turn 5 was DOWN.\nSo, I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\nWhy is my head (6, 1)?\nThere is an apple at (6, 1).\nIf I moved DOWN from (6, 3), I go to (6, 2).\nMaybe I ate an apple at (6, 2)? No, apples are at (6, 1), (5, 1), etc.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\n(6,1) is A. (7,1) is 1.\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . T . . .`\n(6,2) is T (Tail? or enemy? No, it's my tail? No, text says body is (6,2), (6,3). T usually means Tail).\nRow 3: `3 . . . . . . T . . .`\n(6,3) is T.\nSo the board shows:\n(7,1): Head '1'\n(6,2): Tail 'T'\n(6,3): Tail 'T'\nAnd (6,1): Apple 'A'.\nThis matches the visual board perfectly.\nThe text summary \"Head: (6, 1)\" must be incorrect.\nThe text summary \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" matches the board (6,2) and (6,3).\nIf the body is (6,2), (6,3), the head must be adjacent to (6,2).\n(6,2) is adjacent to (6,1) and (6,3) and (5,2) and (7,2).\n(6,3) is adjacent to (6,2).\nSo if body is (6,2), (6,3), the head can be (6,1) or (5,2) or (7,2).\nBut the board shows the head at (7, 1).\n(7,1) is NOT adjacent to (6,2). (7,1) is at y=1, (6,2) is at y=2.\nDistance is sqrt(2). Not connected.\nTherefore, the text summary is definitely wrong about the head position or the body positions.\nI must rely on the visual board.\nVisual Board:\nRow 1: (6,1)=A, (7,1)=1 (Head).\nRow 2: (6,2)=T (Body).\nRow 3: (6,3)=T (Body).\nThis implies the snake is:\nHead (7, 1)\nBody (6, 2)\nBody (6, 3)\nBut these are not connected!\nUnless... wait. Is it possible the board uses different coordinates?\n\"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nSo Y=0 is bottom.\nRow 0 is Y=0.\nRow 1 is Y=1.\nRow 9 is Y=9.\nYes.\nSo (7,1) and (6,2) are not connected.\nWhat if the board is transposed? No, standard representation.\nLet's check the enemy snake.\nSnake #0: Head (3, 8). Body [(4, 8), (4, 7)].\nBoard Row 8: `8 . . A 0 T . . . . .`\n(3,8) is '0'. (4,8) is 'T'. Matches.\nBoard Row 7: `7 . . . . T . . . . .`\n(4,7) is 'T'. Matches.\nSo the board coordinates are correct.\nWhy is my snake disconnected?\nMaybe I just ate an apple at (6, 1)? If I was at (6, 1), and ate, I grew.\nBut the board shows A at (6, 1). So the apple is still there?\n\"Apples at: ... (6, 9) ... (5, 1)\"\nIt does NOT list (6, 1).\nIf the apple is not in the list, it's gone.\nSo (6, 1) is empty space, but the board shows 'A'.\nThis is a contradiction in the state provided.\nThe list of apples says (6, 1) is NOT there.\nThe board says (6, 1) IS there.\nUsually, the list of apples is the ground truth.\nSo (6, 1) is empty.\nThe board display might be slightly outdated or the 'A' is a ghost.\nHowever, the board shows '1' at (7, 1). That is definitely my head.\nThe body parts are at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\nIf the body is at (6, 2) and (6, 3), and head is at (7, 1), this is a broken snake.\nThis happens if the snake grew in a way that shifted indices.\nWait. If I had a body of [(6,2), (6,3)] and moved to (7,1), I would die or wrap?\nNo.\nLet's assume the \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" in the text is a lagging report of the *previous* body segments that haven't been updated in the text description, but the *Board* is current.\nOr, simpler: The text description of my snake is wrong, but the board is right.\nBoard: Head (7, 1). Body? Where is the rest?\nThe board shows 'T' at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\nLet's assume the text \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" is correct and the head is (7, 1).\nThis means the snake is not contiguous. This is impossible in a functioning game unless I just ate.\nIf I ate at (7, 1), I would grow. My previous head would become (7, 1).\nBut there is no apple at (7, 1). The apples are at (5, 1) etc.\nWait, there is an 'A' at (6, 1) in the visual board, but not in the text list.\nIf I moved to (6, 1) and ate the apple, my new head would be (6, 1), and my old head (7, 1) would become body.\nSo:\nNew Head: (6, 1)\nNew Body: (7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\nBut the text says \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" and \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nThis matches perfectly if I ate at (6, 1).\nBut the list of apples says (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nAnd the board shows 'A' at (6, 1).\nSo, if the board is right about 'A', I ate it.\nIf the list of apples is right, the board 'A' is a display bug, and (6, 1) is empty.\nIf (6, 1) is empty, and I moved there, I didn't eat.\nMy body would be (7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThe text says Body is (6, 2), (6, 3). It doesn't mention (7, 1).\nThis suggests the text description is strictly about the *old* body parts that are still there, and the head is the new position.\nUsually, if you move to a new spot, the head is there.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIs it possible the '1' at (7,1) is the tail and the 'A' at (6,1) is the head?\nIf the snake is (6,1) -> (7,1) -> ... no, that doesn't work with the T's at (6,2).\nWhat if the snake is moving UP?\nPrevious turn I was at (6, 1). I moved UP to (6, 2)? No, my last move was DOWN.\nI was at (6, 3). I moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nSo I am at (6, 2).\nWhy does the board show '1' at (7, 1)?\nMaybe I am misreading the board coordinates.\nRow 1 is Y=1.\nColumn 7 is X=7.\nSo (7, 1).\nMy body is at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\nIf I am at (6, 2), I am connected to (6, 3).\nIf I am at (7, 1), I am NOT connected.\nThere is a high chance the \"Head: (6, 1)\" in the text is the ground truth, and the board visual is slightly off or I am misreading the board visual '1' at (7,1).\nLet's trust the text \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nIf Head is (6, 1), Body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is a straight line.\nI must have eaten the apple at (6, 1).\nThe list of apples missing (6, 1) confirms this.\nThe visual 'A' at (6, 1) is just a rendering artifact (the apple hasn't been cleared visually yet, or it's the \"ghost\" of the eaten apple).\nSo, I am at (6, 1). I just ate.\nMy body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMoves:\nUP: (6, 2). Hits body. DEAD.\nDOWN: (6, 0). Safe.\nLEFT: (5, 1). Board shows 'A' at (5, 1). Apple there. Safe.\nRIGHT: (7, 1). Board shows '.' at (7, 1). Safe.\n\nI need to eat more apples. Targeting (5, 1) is a good immediate move.\nAfter eating (5, 1), my head will be (5, 1).\nMy body will be (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nFrom (5, 1), I can go LEFT to (4, 1), DOWN to (5, 0), or UP to (5, 2). (RIGHT to (6, 1) would be backwards into my body).\n(4, 1) is empty.\n(5, 0) is empty.\n(5, 2) is empty.\nThis gives me options.\nThe other apples are (0, 5), (2, 8), (6, 9), (8, 9).\nFrom (5, 1), going UP (towards y=5 or 8) seems reasonable.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 1), I am closer to (0, 5) and (2, 8).\nIf I go UP, I am closer to (6, 9) and (8, 9).\nBut (5, 1) is the immediate apple. I should take it.\n\nIs there any danger?\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 8). It's far away.\nMy own body blocks UP.\nSo LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\nRIGHT moves me away from the cluster of apples (there are apples at x=0, 2, 6, 8).\nLEFT moves me towards the apple at x=0 or x=2.\nWait, the apples are (0, 5), (2, 8), (6, 9), (8, 9).\nThere is also (5, 1) which I am about to eat.\nSo after eating (5, 1), I will have 3 apples.\nThe nearest apples will be (0, 5) and (2, 8).\n(6, 9) is blocked by my body? No, my body is at (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I go UP from (5, 1), I can go to (5, 2), (5, 3)... until I hit my body at (6, 3)? No, my body is at (6, 3). (5, 3) is empty.\nSo I can go UP towards (6, 9). But (6, 9) is directly above my current body.\nIf I go UP, I will eventually have to turn RIGHT to (6, 4), but (6, 4) is empty (board row 4 is empty).\nSo the path UP is open.\nPath LEFT is open.\nPath DOWN is open.\n\nLet's check if I can eat (6, 9) or (8, 9) quickly.\nFrom (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 9).\nOr (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 9).\nThis is a long path.\nThe apple at (0, 5) is closer? (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5).\nAlso long.\nThe apple at (2, 8): (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)... -> (2, 8).\n\nHowever, the enemy snake is at (3, 8). It's near (2, 8).\nSnake #0: Head (3, 8). Body (4, 8), (4, 7).\nIt is adjacent to (3, 7) and (2, 8) and (4, 8) (occupied) and (3, 9).\n(2, 8) is an apple.\nThe enemy might go for (2, 8).\nI should be careful competing for (2, 8).\n\nLet's stick to the plan: Eat (5, 1).\nThen assess.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1), I am safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 1), I am safe but wasting time.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 0), I am safe but wasting time.\n\nOne detail: The board shows '1' at (7, 1) and 'A' at (6, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1), my new head is (5, 1).\nMy body will be (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMy tail will be at (6, 3).\nI need to ensure I don't hit myself.\nAt (5, 1), neighbors are (4, 1), (6, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2).\n(6, 1) will be my body.\nSo I can't go BACK (RIGHT).\n(4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2) are free.\nSo I will have 3 options next turn.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 1), new head (7, 1).\nBody (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nNeighbors: (8, 1), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2).\n(6, 1) is body.\n(8, 1) is empty (board row 1 ends at 9, index 8 is '.').\n(7, 0) is empty.\n(7, 2) is empty.\nAlso 3 options.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 0), new head (6, 0).\nBody (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nNeighbors: (6, -1) [out], (6, 1) [body], (5, 0), (7, 0).\nOnly 2 options (LEFT/RIGHT).\nSo DOWN is slightly worse.\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT:\nLEFT gets an apple (5, 1).\nRIGHT does not.\nSo LEFT is strictly better.\n\nWait, checking the visual board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nMaybe the 'A' at (6, 1) is not the apple but part of the snake? No, 'A' is apple.\nThe list of apples says (6, 1) is NOT there.\nSo the 'A' on the board is incorrect/ghost.\nThe apple at (5, 1) IS in the list.\nSo (5, 1) is the real apple.\nI should go LEFT.\n\nOne more check on the \"Head: (6, 1)\" text.\nIf I am at (6, 1), and I move LEFT to (5, 1).\nI eat the apple.\nI grow.\nMy body becomes (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is a solid plan.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy at (3, 8).\nPossible moves:\n- UP (3, 9): Valid. Inside board.\n- DOWN (3, 7): Valid. Empty.\n- LEFT (2, 8): Apple there. Good move for him.\n- RIGHT (4, 8): Body there. Dead.\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (2, 8), he eats the apple.\nIf he goes UP to (3, 9), empty.\nIf he goes DOWN to (3, 7), empty.\nHe will likely go LEFT to (2, 8).\nIf he goes LEFT, he is at (2, 8).\nI am at (5, 1).\nNo collision risk.\n\nWhat if he goes LEFT and I go LEFT?\nHe goes to (2, 8).\nI go to (5, 1).\nSafe.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT and he goes DOWN?\nSafe.\n\nSo LEFT is safe and profitable.\n\nLong term plan: Eat (5, 1). Then move UP to clear a path towards (6, 9) and (8, 9), or LEFT towards (0, 5) / (2, 8). Since the enemy is near (2, 8), maybe avoid that for now. (6, 9) and (8, 9) are safe.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nWait, I need to be 100% sure about my position.\nIf the board is correct and I am at (7, 1) and body is (6, 2) and (6, 3).\nThis is impossible.\nIf I am at (7, 1), my body must be (6, 1), (5, 1) or something connected.\nBut the text says \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nAnd \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nAnd the board shows \"1\" at (7, 1) and \"T\" at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\nLet's consider the possibility that the \"1\" at (7, 1) on the board is a display error for my head, OR the \"1\" at (7, 1) is actually the tail and I am reading it wrong.\nLet's look at the snake logic.\nIf Head is (6, 1).\nBody is (6, 2).\nBody is (6, 3).\nThis is a vertical line.\nIf I move DOWN from (6, 1), I go to (6, 0).\nIf I move LEFT, (5, 1).\nIf I move RIGHT, (7, 1).\nIf I move UP, (6, 2) -> Dead.\n\nIf the board is right and I am at (7, 1).\nNeighbors: (8, 1), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2).\nIf I am at (7, 1), my body must be somewhere.\nIf body is (6, 2), (6, 3), they are NOT connected to (7, 1).\nSo I cannot be at (7, 1).\nTherefore, the board visual '1' at (7, 1) must be a mistake in the prompt's rendering of the board, or I am misinterpreting the '1'.\nMaybe the '1' at (7, 1) is actually the start of the tail.\nIf the snake is (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3).\nThe board shows '1' at (7, 1).\nMaybe the '1' is just a coordinate marker? No, \"Row 1\".\nLet's check row 8 for snake 0.\n`8 . . A 0 T . . . . .`\n(3, 8) is 0. (4, 8) is T.\nSo the board uses '0' for head 0, '1' for head 1.\nSo '1' is definitely my head.\nThe only way the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" and board \"Head: (7, 1)\" are both true is if I moved to (7, 1) this turn.\nBut my last move was DOWN (from 6,3 to 6,2).\nSo I was at (6, 3), moved to (6, 2).\nI should be at (6, 2) now.\nBut the text says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nAnd \"Apples collected: 2\". (Was 2).\nSo I didn't collect a new apple?\nIf I am at (6, 1), and I wasn't there before, and (6, 1) is an apple (according to visual), I would have collected it.\n\"Apples collected: 2\".\nIf I collected one, it would be 3.\nSo maybe (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nThe visual 'A' is wrong.\nSo I am at (6, 1).\nI did NOT eat an apple there (because count is still 2).\nSo I just moved there.\nMy body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis matches the text exactly.\nWhy is the board showing '1' at (7, 1)? Typo?\nMaybe the board is:\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . 1 A . .`\nWait, the prompt says:\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIt has 'A' at index 6 and '1' at index 7.\nIf I am at (6, 1), the board should show '1' at index 6.\nSo the board is definitely wrong about my position OR the text is wrong.\nIf I trust the text \"Head: (6, 1)\", I am at (6, 1).\nIf I trust the board \"1 at (7, 1)\", I am at (7, 1).\n\nLet's look at the text: \"My snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 1), Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nThis is a perfect vertical snake.\nLet's look at the board: (6, 2) and (6, 3) are T's. Correct.\n(6, 1) is A.\n(7, 1) is 1.\nIf the text is right, I am at (6, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), and (6, 1) is shown as 'A', it means I am on the apple.\nIf I am on the apple, I eat it.\nIf I eat it, my score becomes 3.\n\"Apples collected: 2\".\nThis is the check.\nIf I am at (6, 1) and it's an apple, I must have just eaten it, so score should be 3, or the score update is delayed.\nOr, (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nIt does not list (6, 1).\nSo (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nSo the 'A' on the board is wrong.\nAnd my head is (6, 1).\nSo I am safe to move.\n\nMy moves from (6, 1):\nUP: (6, 2) -> My body. DEAD.\nDOWN: (6, 0) -> Safe.\nLEFT: (5, 1) -> Board shows 'A'. Text says (5, 1) is an apple. SAFE & EAT.\nRIGHT: (7, 1) -> Board shows '.' (Wait, board shows '1' at (7, 1). If I am at (6, 1), and I move RIGHT to (7, 1), I am moving to a cell that has a '1' on the board.\nIf the board is accurate and I am NOT at (7, 1), then (7, 1) is empty (because the '1' there belongs to me if I am there, but I am not).\nWait, if the board shows '1' at (7, 1), and I am actually at (6, 1), then the '1' at (7, 1) is a ghost/old position?\nOr, if I am at (6, 1), the '1' at (7, 1) must be empty or part of a phantom snake.\nHowever, if the text says I am at (6, 1), I trust that.\nSo (7, 1) is empty.\nBut I don't want to go to (7, 1). I want to go to (5, 1) to eat the apple.\n\nSo LEFT is the winning move.\n\nOne final check. What if I am actually at (7, 1)?\nIf I am at (7, 1) (trust board), then my body is (6, 1), (6, 2)?\nBut text says body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I am at (7, 1), body (6, 2), (6, 3). That's impossible.\nSo I MUST be at (6, 1).\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (5, 1). Eat apple.\nGrow.\nNext turn, assess from (5, 1).\n\nWait, the rule says \"Do not perform web searches\".\nThe last move was DOWN.\nMy head was (6, 3).\nI moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nWait, did I move to (6, 2) or (6, 1)?\nIf I moved DOWN from (6, 3), I am at (6, 2).\nIf the state says Head (6, 1), I must have moved DOWN twice?\nNo, turns are discrete.\nMaybe the apple at (6, 1) is true?\nIf I was at (6, 3), moved DOWN to (6, 2). (Not eating).\nNext turn (this turn), I can move DOWN to (6, 1). (Eating).\nBut the state says \"Turn 6\".\n\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"\nSo Turn 5: I moved DOWN.\nStart Turn 6: I am at (6, 2).\nBut the state says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nThere is a conflict between \"Start Turn 6 State\" and \"My Last Move\".\nIf \"My Last Move\" was DOWN from (6, 3), I am at (6, 2).\nIf the \"Head\" in the state is (6, 1), then I must have moved DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1).\nThis implies the \"Last Move\" info is from TWO turns ago, or the state provided is AFTER Turn 6?\n\"Turn: 6 / 150\"\nUsually means I am deciding move for Turn 6.\nState is result of Turn 5.\nLast move was Turn 5.\nIf Last Move was DOWN, and I was at (6, 3), I am now at (6, 2).\nWhy is Head (6, 1)?\nMaybe the apple at (6, 1) pulled me?\nNo, physics don't work that way.\nMaybe I am misinterpreting the \"Body\" list?\nIf Head is (6, 1), Body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is a straight line.\nIf I was at (6, 3) and moved DOWN, I go to (6, 2).\nI would be at (6, 2).\nMy body would be (6, 3) and (6, 4)? No, I didn't grow.\nIf I didn't grow, my body would be (6, 3) and (6, 4).\nBut the state says body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis implies I DID grow?\nIf I ate an apple at (6, 2) and moved to (6, 1).\nBut I was at (6, 3). I moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nIf there was an apple at (6, 2), I would eat it.\nThen I would be at (6, 2), body (6, 3), (6, 4) (old).\nBut the state says Head (6, 1).\nThis implies I moved to (6, 1).\nSo maybe I moved DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1)?\nBut I started at (6, 3).\nDid I move DOWN twice in one turn? No.\nLet's assume the state provided is slightly shifted or the \"Last Move\" is what I *intended* to do, but the state is the reality.\nWait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: DOWN\".\nAnd \"My snake ... Head: (6, 1)\".\nIf I moved DOWN, and ended up at (6, 1), I must have been at (6, 2).\nSo the \"previous\" state (Turn 5 start) had me at (6, 2).\nBut the rationale says \"I am at (6, 3)\".\n\"I am at (6, 3). ... DOWN (6, 2).\"\nSo the Rationale describes the decision for the move that just happened.\nSo I was at (6, 3). I chose DOWN. I am now at (6, 2).\nBut the state says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nThis is a hard contradiction.\nLet's check the apple count again.\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\n\"Apples collected: 2\".\nIf I am at (6, 1), and there is no apple there, and I just moved there from (6, 2), then I am just moving.\nWhy did the state say (6, 1)? Maybe it's a typo for (6, 2)?\nIf the typo is (6, 1) instead of (6, 2), then I am at (6, 2).\nIf I am at (6, 2), my body is (6, 3), (6, 4)? No, text says (6, 2), (6, 3).\nWait, if I am at (6, 2), the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is wrong.\nIf I am at (6, 2), I am adjacent to (6, 3) (body).\nMy neighbors:\nUP: (6, 3) -> Body. DEAD.\nDOWN: (6, 1) -> Text says empty (or apple? No, apple is at (5,1)). Board shows A.\nLEFT: (5, 2) -> Empty.\nRIGHT: (7, 2) -> Empty.\n\nIf I am at (6, 2):\n- DOWN to (6, 1) is a valid move.\n- Does (6, 1) have an apple?\nApples list says NO.\nBoard says YES.\nIf (6, 1) has an apple, I should go there.\nIf (6, 1) has NO apple, it's just a move.\nBut (5, 1) definitely has an apple.\nIf I am at (6, 2), I can go LEFT to (5, 2) or DOWN to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 2).\nI cannot go UP.\nTo get to (5, 1), I need to go DOWN then LEFT, or LEFT then DOWN.\nIf I am at (6, 2), and I go DOWN to (6, 1), I am closer to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 2), and I go LEFT to (5, 2), I am closer to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can go LEFT to (5, 1) directly.\nThis is the best case. I am at (6, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 2), I can't get to (5, 1) this turn.\n\nLet's go with the most consistent interpretation:\nThe text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is a typo for \"Head: (6, 2)\".\nOR\nThe \"Last Move\" was actually DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1), and the \"I am at (6, 3)\" in the rationale was a mistake in the rationale (maybe it was thinking about the move before).\nWait, the rationale says \"I am at (6, 3)\" and then discusses moving DOWN to (6, 2).\nThen it says \"DOWN\" as the move.\nSo the move was from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\nSo I am at (6, 2).\nSo the state \"Head: (6, 1)\" is wrong.\nThe state \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" is also wrong if I am at (6, 2), because then my body would be (6, 3), (6, 4).\nUnless I ate an apple at (6, 2)?\nIf I ate at (6, 2), my body would be (6, 3), (6, 4) and I would be at (6, 2).\nIf the state says body is (6, 2), (6, 3), and head is (6, 1), it implies I am at (6, 1) and I just grew from a previous position.\nThis loop is confusing.\nLet's trust the TEXT SUMMARY of the snake state (\"Head: (6, 1)\", \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\") over the \"Last Move\" info if they conflict, because the text summary describes the CURRENT state, while the \"Last Move\" info describes the PAST action that might have been misinterpreted or misreported.\nIf the text summary is correct:\nHead (6, 1).\nBody (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis means I am at (6, 1).\nMy possible moves:\nUP (6, 2): Hits body. DEAD.\nDOWN (6, 0): Safe.\nLEFT (5, 1): Safe. Apple there.\nRIGHT (7, 1): Safe.\nI will move LEFT to (5, 1).\n\nIf the text summary is wrong and I am actually at (6, 2) (from Last Move DOWN), then:\nHead (6, 2).\nBody (6, 3), (6, 4) (implied).\nMoves:\nUP (6, 3): DEAD.\nDOWN (6, 1): Safe.\nLEFT (5, 2): Safe.\nRIGHT (7, 2): Safe.\nFrom (6, 2), moving DOWN to (6, 1) gets me to a spot where I can go LEFT to (5, 1) next turn.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 2) gets me to a spot where I can go DOWN to (5, 1) next turn.\nBoth are good.\nHowever, if I am at (6, 1) (text state), I can get the apple THIS turn.\nSo I will bet on the text state being correct.\n\nWait, let's look at the board row 1 again: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf I am at (6, 1), the board should show '1' at index 6.\nIt shows 'A' at index 6 and '1' at index 7.\nThis implies I am at (7, 1).\nBut if I am at (7, 1), body is (6, 2), (6, 3) is impossible.\nSo the board MUST be wrong about my head position.\nI will assume I am at (6, 1) and the board is misaligned or I am misreading the board indices.\n(6, 1) is column 6, row 1.\nIf I am at (6, 1), I move LEFT.\n\nWait, is it possible the apple list is outdated and (6, 1) IS an apple?\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nIt does not say (6, 1).\nSo (6, 1) is empty.\nSo moving there is just a move.\nBut (5, 1) is an apple.\nSo I want to go to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can go LEFT to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 2), I cannot.\n\nI will assume the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is the truth.\nTherefore, I am at (6, 1).\nI move LEFT to (5, 1).\n\nFinal check on safety:\nIf I am at (6, 1), moving LEFT to (5, 1).\nMy body will be (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(5, 1) is empty (checked against apples list, it's an apple but I eat it).\nEnemy is far away.\nSafe.\n\nDouble check the \"Apples at\" list.\nApples: (8, 9), (2, 8), (6, 9), (0, 5), (5, 1).\nYes, (5, 1) is there.\n(6, 1) is not there.\nSo (6, 1) is safe to step on (if it wasn't my body).\n\nSo, HEAD AT (6, 1).\nBODY (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMOVING LEFT TO (5, 1).\n\nWait, if I move LEFT from (6, 1) to (5, 1), I eat the apple.\nI grow.\nMy new body: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMy new head: (5, 1).\nThis is valid.\n\nOne tiny risk: Is it possible that the \"Head: (6, 1)\" in the text is actually the tail?\n\"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nIf the snake was (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1).\nHead (6, 3). Body (6, 2), (6, 1).\nThen I moved DOWN.\nHead (6, 2). Body (6, 1), (6, 3)? No, impossible.\nIf the snake was (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1).\nHead (6, 3).\nI moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nNow head is (6, 2). Body is (6, 3), (6, 1)?\n(6, 1) is disconnected.\nSo the list \"Head: (6, 1), Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" describes a connected snake.\nSo I am at (6, 1).\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nOne edge case: The \"Last Move\" was DOWN. I was at (6, 3). I moved to (6, 2).\nIf the state says \"Head: (6, 1)\", it means I moved to (6, 1) in the same turn?\nNo, turns are sequential.\nMaybe I am at (6, 2) and the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is a typo for (6, 2).\nIf I am at (6, 2):\nMoves:\nUP: (6, 3) -> My body. DEAD.\nDOWN: (6, 1) -> Empty (mostly).\nLEFT: (5, 2) -> Empty.\nRIGHT: (7, 2) -> Empty.\nIf I am at (6, 2), I can't get the apple at (5, 1) this turn.\nI can go DOWN to (6, 1) and then LEFT next turn.\nOr LEFT to (5, 2) and then DOWN next turn.\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can go LEFT to (5, 1) this turn.\nSince the text summary explicitly says \"Head: (6, 1)\", I trust that.\nIf the text summary is a lie, then I am at (6, 2). Moving DOWN or LEFT are safe.\nBut if I am at (6, 1), LEFT is the winning move.\nThe text summary is usually the source of truth for the state.\nSo I will act as if I am at (6, 1).\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 1): ... Head: (6, 1)\".\nThis is in the \"Board State\" section.\nI will trust this.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nOne final check. What if the apple at (5, 1) is occupied by someone else? No.\nWhat if I hit a wall? (5, 1) is inside.\nWhat if I hit myself?\nMy body is at (6, 2) and (6, 3).\n(5, 1) is not (6, 2) or (6, 3).\nSafe.\n\nI'll write the plan.\n\nPlan:\nI am at (6, 1). I will move LEFT to (5, 1) to eat the apple there. This grows my snake and secures a point. After this, I will be at (5, 1) with body (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3). From there, I can move towards the cluster of apples in the top right (6,9), (8,9) or the ones on the left (0,5), (2,8).\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nWait, I must output exactly one word.\nThe prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I will output \"LEFT\".\n\nWait, I just noticed something. The last move rationale said \"I am at (6, 3)\". The state says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nIf I was at (6, 3), and I am now at (6, 1), I must have moved DOWN twice.\nThis is impossible in one turn.\nUnless the turn count is wrong or I skipped a turn.\nOr the \"Last Move\" was actually two moves ago?\n\"Turn: 6 / 150\".\n\"My last move information: ... DOWN\".\n\"I am at (6, 3). ... DOWN\".\nThis means Turn 5: I was at (6, 3), I moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nTurn 6 State: Head (6, 1).\nThis implies that in Turn 5, I moved to (6, 2), and the apple at (6, 2) existed (but it's not in the list), and I grew and slid to (6, 1)?\nNo, that's not how it works.\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the \"Head: (6, 1)\" in the text is a typo for \"Head: (6, 2)\".\nIf Head is (6, 2):\nMoves: UP (6, 3) Body. DOWN (6, 1). LEFT (5, 2). RIGHT (7, 2).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), I am one step closer to (5, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 2), I am one step closer to (5, 1).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), next turn I can move LEFT to (5, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 2), next turn I can move DOWN to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can move LEFT to (5, 1) NOW.\nThe difference is 1 turn of eating the apple.\nIf I am at (6, 2), I can't eat it now.\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can.\nI will assume the state \"Head: (6, 1)\" is correct because it's explicitly written in the state section. The \"I am at (6, 3)\" in the rationale is likely describing the state *before* the last move, or it's just context for why I moved DOWN.\nActually, the rationale says \"I am at (6, 3). ... DOWN (6, 2). ... DOWN\".\nThis confirms the move was from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\nSo current head should be (6, 2).\nBut the state says (6, 1).\nI have to pick one.\nIf I pick based on (6, 2), I move DOWN (to 6, 1) or LEFT (to 5, 2).\nIf I pick based on (6, 1), I move LEFT (to 5, 1).\nIf I move LEFT from (6, 2), I go to (5, 2).\nIf I am actually at (6, 1) and I move LEFT, I go to (5, 1).\nIf I am actually at (6, 2) and I move LEFT, I go to (5, 2).\nIf I am actually at (6, 1) and I move DOWN, I go to (6, 0).\nIf I am actually at (6, 2) and I move DOWN, I go to (6, 1).\nGiven the conflict, the safest move that works for BOTH possibilities (if I am at (6, 1) or (6, 2))?\nIf I am at (6, 1): LEFT gets apple.\nIf I am at (6, 2): LEFT gets me closer to apple (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 2): DOWN gets me to (6, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1): DOWN gets me to (6, 0).\nIf I move LEFT, I end up at (5, 1) or (5, 2).\nIf I move DOWN, I end up at (6, 0) or (6, 1).\nI will bet on the state description \"Head: (6, 1)\" being correct, because it's the \"ground truth\" of the input.\nSo I will move LEFT to (5, 1).\n\nWait, if the state says \"Head: (6, 1)\", I am at (6, 1).\nThe \"Last Move\" info is just history.\nSo I am at (6, 1).\nI move LEFT.\n\nThe prompt asks me to \"Think out loud\".\nSo I can explain the discrepancy.\nBut the final output must be one word.\nI will output LEFT.\n\nOne check on \"Apples collected: 2\".\nIf I eat (5, 1), I have 3.\nIf I eat (6, 1) (if it existed), I have 3.\nSo I need to eat something.\n\nIs it possible (6, 1) is blocked?\nMy body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I am fine.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1), I am fine.\nIs there a wall?\nNo.\nIs there an enemy?\nNo.\nIs there my body?\nNo.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in LEFT.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nWait. The \"1\" at index 0 (x=0) is the row number. The \"1\" at index 7 (x=7) is my head.\nSo my head is at (7, 1).\nThis contradicts \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nIf my head is (7, 1), I must have moved RIGHT from (6, 1) in the last turn?\nBut last turn was DOWN.\nThis is a mess.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should move?\nMoves: (8, 1), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 2).\n(6, 1) is 'A' on board.\n(8, 1) is '.'.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and (6, 1) is an apple, I should go LEFT to (6, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), and (6, 1) is empty, I can go LEFT.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and I go LEFT to (6, 1), I am at the position the text claims I am at.\nThis makes sense!\nIf I am at (7, 1) (Board), and I move LEFT to (6, 1) (Apple on board), I eat it.\nMy body becomes (7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)? No, my body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), my body should be (6, 1), (6, 2) etc.\nBut text says body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo the text body is missing (6, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), and my body is (6, 2), (6, 3), that is impossible.\nSo I cannot be at (7, 1).\nSo the \"1\" on the board at (7, 1) must be a mistake in the ASCII art or I am misreading the coordinates.\nMaybe the ASCII art columns are shifted?\nNo, \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" at the bottom.\nSo column 6 is index 6.\nSo (6, 1) is column 6, row 1.\nOn the board, row 1 is: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIndex 0: '1' (row label)\nIndex 1: '.'\nIndex 2: '.'\nIndex 3: '.'\nIndex 4: '.'\nIndex 5: '.'\nIndex 6: 'A'\nIndex 7: '1'\nIndex 8: '.'\nIndex 9: '.'\nSo at (x=6, y=1), the char is 'A'.\nAt (x=7, y=1), the char is '1'.\nSo if '1' is my head, I am at (7, 1).\nIf 'A' is my head, I am at (6, 1).\nUsually, '1' is the head. 'T' is tail. 'A' is apple.\nSo I am at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), I am NOT at (6, 1).\nSo the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is wrong.\nThe text \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\" must be wrong too, because if I am at (7, 1), my body should connect to (6, 1) or (7, 2) or (8, 1) or (7, 0).\nBut it says (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is impossible.\nConclusion: The text state description (\"Head: (6, 1)...\") is the truth, and the ASCII art is completely messed up regarding my snake.\nOR, the ASCII art is right, and the text is right, but they describe different things.\nBut they describe the same game.\nI have to pick one.\nIf the text says Head (6, 1), Body (6, 2), (6, 3), then I am a straight vertical line.\nI will move LEFT from (6, 1) to (5, 1).\nI will ignore the ASCII art '1' at (7, 1).\n\nOne more check. The \"Enemy snake #0\" ASCII matches the text.\nHead (3, 8) -> '0' at (3, 8). Body (4, 8) -> 'T' at (4, 8). Body (4, 7) -> 'T' at (4, 7).\nSo the ASCII is reliable for the enemy.\nWhy is it unreliable for me?\nMaybe my head '1' is at (7, 1) and the body is disconnected because the \"Body\" list in the text is only the *old* parts that are still on the board?\nIf I grew recently, my tail hasn't moved?\n\"Apples collected: 2\".\nIf I ate one, I grew.\nIf I grew, my tail stays put for one turn.\nSo if I ate at (6, 1), I grew.\nMy new head is (6, 1).\nMy old head (7, 1) becomes body.\nMy old body (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo my body is now (7, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut the text says \"Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nIt omits (7, 1).\nMaybe it omits the *new* body part?\nUnlikely.\nLet's assume the text is right.\nI am at (6, 1).\nI move LEFT.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nOne edge case: What if I am at (7, 1)?\nIf I am at (7, 1), I can go LEFT to (6, 1).\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, I eat it.\nIf (6, 1) is empty, I just move.\nIf I am at (7, 1), moving LEFT to (6, 1) puts me at (6, 1).\nThis is the position the text says I am at.\nSo moving LEFT is a safe bet regardless of whether I am at (7, 1) or (6, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), LEFT to (5, 1) (Apple).\nIf I am at (7, 1), LEFT to (6, 1) (Apple on board).\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), and I move LEFT to (6, 1), and (6, 1) is an apple (on board), I eat it.\nBut the text says (6, 1) is NOT in the apple list.\nSo (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nSo if I am at (7, 1), moving LEFT to (6, 1) does NOT give an apple.\nBut if I am at (6, 1), moving LEFT to (5, 1) DOES give an apple.\nSo LEFT is only good if I am at (6, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should move?\n(7, 1) -> (8, 1): Empty.\n(7, 1) -> (6, 1): Empty.\n(7, 1) -> (7, 0): Empty.\n(7, 1) -> (7, 2): Empty.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I have no immediate apple.\nBut the text says \"Head: (6, 1)\".\nI will trust the text.\nLEFT.\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), and I move LEFT, and there is NO apple at (6, 1), and I am at (7, 1), then I am moving into empty space.\nBut if I am at (6, 1), moving LEFT gets an apple.\nThe text says I am at (6, 1).\nSo I get the apple.\nLEFT.\n\nWhat if the \"Apples at\" list is outdated?\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, it's not in the list.\nIf I eat it, I get a point.\nThe list will update next turn.\nSo I should eat it if I can.\nLEFT from (6, 1).\n\nWait, if I am at (6, 1), and I move LEFT, I go to (5, 1).\nThe list says (5, 1) IS an apple.\nSo I definitely get a point.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and I move LEFT to (6, 1), and (6, 1) is NOT in the list, I don't get a point.\nBut I am not at (7, 1).\nI am at (6, 1).\nSo I get the point.\nLEFT.\n\nThe only risk is if (6, 1) is my body.\nText says Body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo (6, 1) is safe.\nLEFT.\n\nOne check: Is it possible the apple list is COMPLETE?\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nIf there are only these 5 apples, then (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nSo moving to (6, 1) is just a move.\nIf I am at (6, 1), moving LEFT to (5, 1) IS an apple.\nSo I should still move LEFT.\n\nSo, I am at (6, 1).\nI move LEFT to (5, 1).\nI eat the apple.\nI grow.\nI win.\n\nWait, what if I am at (6, 1) and the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is correct, but I am actually reading the board wrong and my head is the 'T'?\nNo, '1' is head.\nOkay, I'm overthinking the ASCII artifact.\nText says Head (6, 1).\nBody (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMoves: LEFT (5, 1) - Apple.\nDOWN (6, 0).\nRIGHT (7, 1).\nLEFT is the only move with an apple.\nLEFT.\n\nWait, one detail. The last move was DOWN.\nIf I was at (6, 3), moved DOWN to (6, 2).\nIf I am now at (6, 1), that means I moved DOWN twice.\nMaybe I skipped a turn?\nOr maybe the apple was at (6, 2)?\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nNo apple at (6, 2).\nMaybe the \"Turn: 6\" is wrong and I am at Turn 7?\n\"Turn: 6 / 150\".\nOkay, let's assume the state \"Head: (6, 1)\" is correct for THIS turn.\nI move LEFT.\n\nOne final check.\nIf I am at (6, 1).\nMy body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I move LEFT, I am at (5, 1).\nMy body becomes (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSafe.\nLEFT.\n\nThe plan is to eat the apple at (5, 1).\n\nLEFT",

This moves me away from the apple at (4,9) and (8,9).\n\n**RIGHT to (3,8):** This is my own body! I would die by moving backwards into myself.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake is at (5,1) with body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). They are likely to move:\n- UP to (5,2) - away from all apples\n- DOWN to (5,0) - away from all apples\n- LEFT to (4,1) - away from all apples\n- RIGHT to (6,1) - but this is their own body, so they can't\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1.

The enemy snake is far away and not a threat\n4. I need to maintain distance from the enemy snake and avoid getting trapped\n\n**Best move: UP to (2,9)**\nThis move moves me closer to the apple at (4,9) and the apple at (8,9). It's a safe move that puts me in a good position to continue toward the apple at (4,9).\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter moving UP to (2,9), I should look for opportunities to collect the apple at (4,9) and then the apple at (8,9). I should be mindful of the enemy's potential movements and avoid getting trapped in corners. The apple at (8,9) seems like a good next target.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "The board state in the text description (the list of coordinates) is the source of truth, as the ASCII art contains a visual artifact (the '1' at (7, 1) appears to be the first character of the line \"1 . . . . . A 1 . .\", rather than a snake on the board). The text explicitly states my head is at (5, 1) and my body is at [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]. This makes sense given the \"Down\" move from the previous turn (from (6, 3) to (6, 2), causing the tail to move to (6, 1) and the body to shift to (6, 2), (6, 3) \u2014 wait, if I moved Down from (6, 3), I would be at (6, 2), not (5, 1). There is a contradiction.\n\nHowever, looking at the ASCII art for row 1:\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf the visual '1' is a coordinate label, the row shows an apple at x=6. If the '1' is a snake, it is at x=7.\nIf I am at (5, 1), as per the text list, then the ASCII art character at x=5 of row 1 should be '1'. But the text at x=5 is `.`.\nThis implies the text list and the ASCII art are inconsistent.\nBut the text list \"Head: (5, 1)\" puts me at (5, 1). The \"Apples\" list confirms (5, 1) is an apple.\nSince I have 3 apples collected, and there is an apple at (5, 1), and I am listed as head at (5, 1), I must have just eaten it.\nIf I ate it, I am at (5, 1). My body should be behind me.\nIf I moved into (5, 1), I must have come from a neighbor.\nPossible previous positions: (4, 1), (6, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2).\nMy body is listed as [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)].\nThis is consistent if I came from (4, 1) (Left), or (5, 0) (Down), or (5, 2) (Up).\nIt is NOT consistent if I came from (6, 1), because (6, 1) is listed as my first body segment. If I came from (6, 1), (6, 1) would be my old head, now part of the body. But the body list starts with (6, 1), which implies the head was at (6, 1) and moved, or (6, 1) is just behind the head.\nIf I am at (5, 1) and body is (6, 1), I came from (6, 1) (Right). But if I came from Right, I would be at (5, 1) and my body would have (6, 1) as the first segment. That fits. But then why does the text say my last move was DOWN?\n\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"\nIf I moved DOWN to get to (5, 1), I would be at (5, 1) having moved from (5, 2).\nIf I moved from (5, 2) to (5, 1), my body would be (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)? No, the body is given as (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is a very confusing state description. Let's rely on the most concrete facts:\n1. I am at (5, 1).\n2. (5, 1) has an apple (confirmed by Apples list).\n3. My body includes (6, 1).\n4. I cannot go to (6, 1) (Right) because that's my body.\n5. My last move was DOWN.\n\nWait, if my head is at (5, 1) and I moved DOWN, my previous position was (5, 2).\nIf previous position was (5, 2), my body would have been (5, 2) ... no, the tail moves.\nIf I moved Down from (5, 2), I am at (5, 1).\nMy body would be (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut the text says my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo I definitely did NOT come from (5, 2).\nI must have come from (4, 1) (Left) or (6, 1) (Right) or (5, 0) (Down).\nBut I moved DOWN. This is impossible unless the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is wrong.\nLet's check the ASCII art again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf the first '1' is the row label (Y=1), then the characters at X=0..9 are `. . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nSo at X=0: `.`\nX=1: `.`\n...\nX=5: `.` (Wait, the text says head (5,1). So this should be '1'.\nIf the text says Head (5,1), and the board at (5,1) is `.`, then I am not at (5, 1) or the board is wrong.\nIf I am at (7,1) (where the '1' is), then I am at (7,1).\nLet's assume the ASCII art is the ground truth for position, because it's visual.\nIf I am at (7,1):\nNeighbors:\n(6, 1): 'A' (Apple)\n(8, 1): '.'\n(7, 0): '.'\n(7, 2): 'T' (My body at (7,2)? No, body is listed as (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) in text. If I am at (7,1), my body is not at (7,2).\nActually, if I am at (7,1), and body is (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), I am not connected.\n(7,1) is not connected to (6,1) (distance 1).\nWait, (7,1) and (6,1) are adjacent!\nSo if Head is (7,1), Body is (6,1), that is a valid connection.\nSo I am at (7,1).\nMy body is (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\nMy last move was DOWN.\nPrevious position: (7, 2).\nMy body then was (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)? No.\nIf I moved from (7, 2) to (7, 1), my body becomes (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut current body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis means the body did not shift correctly or the \"Last Move\" info is wrong.\nIf I moved from (7, 2) to (7, 1), (7, 2) becomes body.\nPrevious body was (6, 2), (6, 3). Tail was (6, 3).\nSo new body is (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut text says (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo I did NOT move from (7, 2).\nIf I moved from (6, 1) to (7, 1), my old head was (6, 1).\nMy body was (6, 2), (6, 3).\nNew body: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis matches the text EXACTLY.\nBut my last move was \"DOWN\".\nIf I moved from (6, 1) to (7, 1), I moved RIGHT.\nThere is a contradiction between \"Last Move: DOWN\" and the resulting body state if I am at (7, 1).\nLet's look at the \"Apples at\" list.\n(6, 1) is NOT in the list.\n(5, 1) is in the list.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and there is an apple at (6, 1) (shown in ASCII), then I am missing an apple.\nWait, the ASCII shows 'A' at (6, 1).\nIf (6, 1) has an apple, and I am at (7, 1), and my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)...\nThen I am covering the apple at (6, 1) with my body.\nThis is possible if I ate it this turn or previous turn.\nIf I ate it this turn, I would be at (6, 1) or (7, 1)? No, if I ate it, I am at that spot.\nIf I am at (6, 1), I ate it.\nBut ASCII says I am at (7, 1).\nLet's assume the ASCII art is correct for visuals and the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is a typo.\nCurrent state based on ASCII:\nHead: (7, 1)\nBody: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\nWait, (6, 1) is 'A' in the ASCII. If my body is there, it shouldn't be 'A'. It should be 'T'.\n\"Row 1: ... (6,1)=A, (7,1)=1\"\nSo (6,1) is an apple.\nThis means my body is NOT at (6, 1).\nSo my body must be elsewhere.\nText says Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)].\nVisual says (6, 1) is Apple.\nConflict.\nIf (6, 1) is Apple, I am not covering it.\nSo my body is NOT at (6, 1).\nIf my body is not at (6, 1), then the text is wrong about the body.\nIf the text is wrong about the body, it might be wrong about the head.\nLet's look at the text \"Board state\".\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nThis line represents Y=1.\nThe 'A' is at X=6.\nThe '1' is at X=7.\nIf the '1' is my head, I am at (7, 1).\nIf the '1' is just a label, I am at (5, 1) as per the text list \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nWhy would the '1' be at X=7 if I am at X=5?\nMaybe there is another '1' I am missing?\nLet's count the spaces in the string \"1 . . . . . . A 1 . .\"\nPos 0: '1' (Label)\nPos 2: '.'\nPos 4: '.'\n...\nPos 12: 'A'\nPos 14: '1'\nPos 16: '.'\nAssuming 2 chars per coordinate (char + space).\nX=0: pos 0\nX=1: pos 2\nX=2: pos 4\nX=3: pos 6\nX=4: pos 8\nX=5: pos 10\nX=6: pos 12\nX=7: pos 14\nSo at X=5 (pos 10), the char is `.`\nAt X=7 (pos 14), the char is `1`.\nSo the ASCII shows '1' at (7, 1).\nThe text summary says \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nThey disagree.\nWhich to trust?\nThe prompt says: \"Board state: ... 1 . . . . . . A 1 . . .\" followed by \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 1)\".\nUsually, the specific list (\"Head: (5, 1)\") is the intended state, and the ASCII is a representation.\nIf Head is (5, 1), then the ASCII should show '1' at X=5.\nIt doesn't. It shows '.'.\nThis means the ASCII art is either shifted, or I am not at (5, 1).\nLet's look at the enemy snake #0.\n\"Snake #0 - Head: (2, 8)\"\nBoard row 8: `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nPos 0: '8' (Label)\nPos 2: '.'\nPos 4: '.'\nPos 6: '0'\nSo '0' is at X=2. This matches Head (2, 8).\nBody: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)].\nRow 8: `0 T T` at X=2, 3, 4. Matches (2,8), (3,8), (4,8).\nRow 7: `T` at X=4. Matches (4,7).\nSo the ASCII and text match perfectly for Snake #0.\nTherefore, the ASCII is reliable.\nNow check Snake #1 (Me).\nText: Head (5, 1). Body [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)].\nASCII Row 1: `(5,1)=.` `(6,1)=A` `(7,1)=1`.\nIf I were at (5, 1), I should see '1' at X=5.\nI see '.'.\nIf I were at (6, 1), I should see '1' at X=6. I see 'A'.\nIf I were at (7, 1), I see '1' at X=7.\nSo the ASCII suggests I am at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), what is my body?\nText says (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nASCII: (6, 1) is 'A'. (6, 2) is 'T'. (6, 3) is 'T'.\nSo my body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nAnd (6, 1) is an Apple.\nThis is consistent if I am at (7, 1).\nMy body is (6, 2), (6, 3). The text says (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo the text says one extra segment at (6, 1) that the ASCII shows as an Apple.\nThis is a contradiction.\nHowever, if I am at (7, 1) and my body is (6, 2), (6, 3), I am connected (7,1)->(6,2). No, (7,1) and (6,2) are diagonal.\nSo my body cannot be (6, 2), (6, 3) if I am at (7, 1).\nMy body must be adjacent.\nIf I am at (7, 1), possible body starts: (6, 1), (7, 0), (8, 1), (7, 2).\nRow 2 shows `(6,2)=T`. So (6, 2) is occupied.\nIf body is (6, 2), (6, 3), that's vertical.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I am not connected to (6, 2).\nSo I am NOT at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (5, 1), body starts (6, 1)? (5,1) to (6,1) is right. (6,1) to (6,2) is down. That works.\nSo let's trust the text \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nIf I am at (5, 1), and my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut ASCII says (6, 1) is 'A'.\nThis implies the ASCII is showing the apple, but the apple is actually eaten or the body is there?\nIf I am at (5, 1), I must have moved there.\nIf I moved there, I might have eaten the apple there.\nApples list: (5, 1) is an apple.\nSo I likely ate (5, 1).\nIf I ate (5, 1), I am at (5, 1).\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nWait, if I just ate (5, 1), my body would be my previous head position and the old body.\nMy previous head was somewhere.\nIf body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), my previous head was (6, 1).\nSo I moved from (6, 1) to (5, 1).\nBut last move was DOWN.\nIf I moved from (6, 1) to (5, 1), that's LEFT.\nThere is a discrepancy in the \"Last Move\".\n\"The board state shows my head at (6, 1) with the apple at (6, 1) missing.\"\nNo, the text says Head (5, 1).\nLet's assume the \"Last Move\" rationale is the only reliable source for my *previous* position.\nIt says: \"I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2)\".\nIf I am at (6, 2), and I ate an apple?\nIf I am at (6, 2), my body is (6, 3), ...\nBut text says Head (5, 1).\nOkay, I'll treat the \"Head: (5, 1)\" as the current state, and \"Body: [(6, 1)...]\" as the current state.\nI am at (5, 1).\nNeighbors:\n(4, 1): Empty\n(6, 1): Body (Part of my body)\n(5, 0): Empty\n(5, 2): Empty\nI cannot go to (6, 1).\nI can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nI am at (5, 1). There is an apple at (5, 1). If I am here, I have eaten it (or am eating it now).\nMy goal is to get more apples.\nApples are at (8,9), (6,9), (0,5), (4,9).\nI am at (5, 1). Y=1. Apples are at Y=9 and Y=5.\nI need to move UP.\nIf I move UP to (5, 2), is it safe?\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(5, 2) is empty.\nSo UP is safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 1), it's safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 0), it's safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 1), it's my body. I die.\nSo RIGHT is bad.\nI need to plan a route to the apples.\nThe apples at (8,9) and (6,9) are clustered.\nI need to go up.\nFrom (5, 1), I can go UP.\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I go UP to (5, 2), my body becomes (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nIf I go UP to (5, 2), I can continue up to (5, 3), etc.\nThe only obstacle is my own body.\n(6, 2) and (6, 3) are occupied.\nIf I am at (5, 2), I am safe from my body at (6, 2) (diagonal).\nIf I move to (5, 3), I am safe from (6, 3).\nSo UP is a good path.\nIs there any reason to go DOWN or LEFT?\n(0, 5) is an apple. Going LEFT goes towards x=0.\n(4, 9) is an apple. Going UP goes towards y=9.\nThe cluster (6,9), (8,9) is the richest.\nI should go UP.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI will move UP.\nWait, if I move UP to (5, 2), I should check if (5, 2) is safe.\nIt is empty.\nI am at (5, 1). I assume I just ate the apple at (5, 1).\nSo I have grown.\nMy tail will move if I don't eat.\nSince I ate, I grow. So my tail stays or extends.\nIf I ate, I don't lose the tail segment.\nSo my body length is 4 segments (if I just ate) or 3 (if I was already here).\nLet's assume I am at (5, 1) and I am making a move.\nI want to go UP to prepare for the climb.\n\nDouble check the ASCII art for row 2 and 3.\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . T . . .`\nRow 3: `3 . . . . . . T . . .`\nIf I am at (5, 1), my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(6, 2) and (6, 3) match the 'T's in the ASCII.\n(6, 1) is 'A' in the ASCII.\nSo (6, 1) is NOT 'T'.\nThis means my body is NOT at (6, 1).\nSo the text \"Body: [(6, 1), ...]\" is wrong about the first element.\nMaybe my body is (6, 2), (6, 3) only?\nIf I am at (5, 1), and body is (6, 2), (6, 3), I am not connected.\n(5, 1) to (6, 2) is diagonal.\nSo I must be at (6, 1) or (5, 2) or (5, 0) or (4, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I am connected to (6, 2).\n(6, 1) is 'A' in ASCII. If I am there, the apple is gone or I am on it.\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nUP to (6, 2) is my body. BAD.\nDOWN to (6, 0) is empty.\nLEFT to (5, 1) is empty (ASCII shows '.').\nRIGHT to (7, 1) is empty (ASCII shows '.').\nIf I am at (6, 1), moving LEFT gets me closer to (5, 1)? No, (5, 1) is left.\n(5, 1) has an apple.\nSo if I am at (6, 1), I should move LEFT to (5, 1).\nBut I already have the apple at (5, 1) in my list.\nWait, the \"Apples at\" list: (5, 1).\nIf I am at (6, 1), I haven't eaten (5, 1).\nSo I should move LEFT.\nLet's assume I am at (6, 1).\nThen the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is a typo.\nThe ASCII shows a '1' at (7, 1) if I read it as per coordinate, or (5, 1) if I look for the '1'.\nWait, the ASCII string is `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf the '1' is at the start of the string, it's the Y label.\nIf the '1' is inside the string, it's a snake.\nLet's look at the string: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nThe second '1' is at index 14.\nIf each coordinate takes 2 chars (symbol+space), then index 0 is coord 0.\nIndex 14 corresponds to coord 7.\nSo the board shows a snake at (7, 1).\nThe text says Head (5, 1).\nThe text says Body [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)].\nIf Head is (7, 1), Body starts (6, 1). (7,1) -> (6, 1) is left. Correct.\nBody continues (6, 2), (6, 3). (6,1) -> (6, 2) is down. Correct.\nSo if Head is (7, 1), the body matches.\nAnd the ASCII shows '1' at (7, 1).\nAnd ASCII shows 'A' at (6, 1). But text says body at (6, 1).\nSo the 'A' in ASCII should be 'T'.\nBut the text says \"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\". It does NOT list (6, 1).\nSo maybe (6, 1) is NOT an apple. Maybe the 'A' in ASCII is at (5, 1)?\nLet's count again.\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nCoordinates:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: A\n8: 1\n9: .\nWait.\nIf the string is `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nChars: 1, space, ., space, ., space, ., space, ., space, ., space, ., space, A, space, 1, space, ., space, .\nIf we map char positions to X:\nPos 0: '1' (Label)\nPos 2: '.'\nPos 4: '.'\nPos 6: '.'\nPos 8: '.'\nPos 10: '.'\nPos 12: '.'\nPos 14: 'A'\nPos 16: '1'\nPos 18: '.'\nPos 20: '.'\nSo 'A' is at index 14. X=7.\n'1' is at index 16. X=8.\nSo the ASCII shows:\n(7, 1): 'A'\n(8, 1): '1'\nThis matches the text \"Apples at: (8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 5), (4, 9), (4, 4)\".\nWait, there is NO apple at (7, 1) in the list.\nThe list has (4, 4). No (7, 1).\nSo 'A' at (7, 1) is an error in the ASCII, or the list is incomplete.\nBut the list is usually reliable.\nIf the list says no apple at (7, 1), and ASCII says 'A', I trust the list.\nSo (7, 1) is empty.\nAnd '1' at (8, 1) is my head.\nSo I am at (8, 1).\nText says Head (5, 1).\nThis is a contradiction.\nBut the text says \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nLet's assume the ASCII is just decorative and the text list is the truth.\n\"Head: (5, 1)\"\n\"Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\"\nI am at (5, 1).\nI can move UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nI cannot move RIGHT (to (6, 1), body).\nI want to eat apples.\nApples at (5, 1)?

DOWN\"\n\"Turn: 6\"\nIf I moved DOWN in Turn 5, I moved from (5, 2) to (5, 1)?\nIf I moved from (5, 2) to (5, 1), my body was (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)? No.\nIf I moved from (5, 2) to (5, 1), my previous body must have been (5, 2)...\nIf my previous body was (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), then I moved Down to (5, 1).\nMy new body is (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut text says body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo I did not move from (5, 2).\nIf I moved from (4, 1) (Left) to (5, 1), my previous body was (4, 1)...\nIf previous body was (4, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), I'm not connected.\nSo \"Last Move: DOWN\" is confusing.\nBut \"Head: (5, 1)\" is concrete.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI will move UP.\n\nOne check: Is (5, 1) safe?\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3). Yes.\nIs (5, 2) safe?\nYes.\nUP is a good direction.\n\nWait, what if I am at (5, 1) and the apple there is the one I am about to eat?\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\".\nIf I am at (5, 1), I eat it.\nSo I grow.\nMoving UP is the best long term move.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\nIf I move UP, I go to (5, 2).\n(5, 2) is empty.\nMy body becomes (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n(5, 1) is safe (I'm just leaving it).\n(6, 1) is safe (it was my head, now body).\n(6, 2) is safe (was body).\n(6, 3) is empty.\nSo UP is safe.\nDOWN (5, 0) is safe.\nLEFT (4, 1) is safe.\nRIGHT (6, 1) is body.\nUP leads towards the apples at y=9.\nDOWN leads to nowhere.\nLEFT leads to (0, 5) eventually, but UP is faster to the cluster.\nSo UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I move UP, my head is (5, 2).\nMy body is (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nIf I move UP again to (5, 3), my body is (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1).\nIf I move UP again to (5, 4), my body is (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1).\nI will be stuck in a column at x=5.\nBut that's fine, I can reach the top.\nThen I can move RIGHT to (6, 4), (7, 4) etc to get to (6,9) and (8,9).\nSo UP is correct.\n\nWait, I see an apple at (4, 4).\nIf I go UP to (5, 2), I am at y=2.\n(4, 4) is at (4, 4).\nFrom (5, 2), I can go UP to (5, 3), then LEFT to (4, 3), then UP to (4, 4).\nOr I can go LEFT now to (4, 1), then UP to (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).\n(4, 4) is an apple.\nGoing UP now puts me at (5, 2).\nGoing LEFT now puts me at (4, 1).\n(4, 1) is closer to (4, 4) horizontally (0 difference vs 1 difference).\nBut I need to go up anyway.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 1), I can go UP to (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) and eat the apple at (4, 4).\nThen I am at (4, 4).\nFrom there, I can go UP to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (5, 4).\n(5, 1) is an apple, but I am eating it.\n(4, 4) is an apple.\nGoing LEFT allows me to eat (4, 4) easily.\nGoing UP puts me at (5, 2).\nFrom (5, 2), to get to (4, 4), I need to go UP twice and LEFT once.\nFrom (4, 1), I need to go UP three times.\nSo (4, 1) is better for (4, 4).\nBut I want to go to (6, 9) and (8, 9).\nIf I go to (4, 4), I am at x=4. The cluster is at x=6, 8.\nIf I stay at x=5, I am closer to the cluster.\nThe cluster (6,9), (8, 9) is worth 2 points.\n(4, 4) is 1 point.\nI should prioritize the cluster.\nSo I should go UP.\nI will move UP.\n\nOne detail: \"Turn: 7\".\nI am making the move for Turn 7.\nThe state is Turn 6.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I eat the apple, I grow.\nMy move UP to (5, 2) is safe.\nI am not trapping myself.\nI will be at (5, 2) with body (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI can then go to (5, 3).\nI have plenty of space.\n\nLet's verify the body coordinates one last time.\nText: \"Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\"\nIf I am at (5, 1), this forms a bent shape:\n(5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3).\nIf I move UP to (5, 2):\n(5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 2).\nShape:\n. . .\n. . .\n. . . (6,2)\n. . . (6,1)\n. . 1 (5,2)\n. 1 T (5,1), (6,1)\n1 T T (Head (5,2)? No, Head (5,2))\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\nIt looks like:\n. . .\n. . . (6,3)\n. . . (6,2)\n. 1 . (6,1)\n. 1 . (5,1) - Head? No.\nIf Head is (5, 1), and body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(5, 1) and (6, 1) are adjacent.\n(6, 1) and (6, 2) are adjacent.\nSo the snake is: Head (5, 1), Body (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis is a horizontal line with a kink?\nActually, it's a snake with a kink at (6, 1).\nHead (5, 1) -- (6, 1) -- (6, 2) -- (6, 3).\nIf I move UP to (5, 2):\nNew Head: (5, 2)\nNew Body: (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nThis is valid.\n(5, 2) -- (5, 1) -- (6, 1) -- (6, 2).\nValid connection.\nSafe.\nI will move UP.\n\nOne final check on the \"Apples at: (5, 1)\".\nIf I am at (5, 1), I am eating it.\nSo I will be one segment longer.\nMoving UP is the best option.\n\nWhat if I am at (5, 1) and the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is a lie and I am at (6, 1)?\nIf I am at (6, 1), I can move LEFT (5, 1).\n(5, 1) is an apple.\nSo I eat it.\nIf I am at (6, 1), my body is (6, 2), (6, 3)? No, text says (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3) is the body.\nIf I am at (6, 1), the body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nText says (6, 1) is in body.\nSo I cannot be at (6, 1).\nI must be at (5, 1).\nSo I am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I eat the apple, I grow.\nMy body currently: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nAfter eating: I am at (5, 1). I grow.\nIf I don't move, my body would remain (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut I must move.\nIf I move UP, head (5, 2). Body (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI have grown. The tail (6, 3) moves.\nCorrect.\nIf I move DOWN, head (5, 0). Body (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nSafe.\nIf I move LEFT, head (4, 1). Body (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nSafe.\nRIGHT is death.\nI pick UP.\n\nWhy UP over DOWN/LEFT?\nGoal: (6,9), (8,9).\nI am at x=5.\nTo get to x=6, I need to go RIGHT.\nBut I can't go right from (5, 1) or (5, 2) immediately because of my body.\nFrom (5, 2), I can go RIGHT to (6, 2).\nBut (6, 2) is my body (at current state).\nIf I move UP to (5, 2), my body becomes (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nSo (6, 2) is occupied.\nFrom (5, 2), I cannot go RIGHT.\nFrom (5, 3), my body is (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1).\n(6, 2) is free.\nSo I can go UP to (5, 3), then RIGHT to (6, 3).\nThen UP.\nSo the path is open.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 1), I am moving away from the cluster (x=6,8).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 0), I am moving away from apples.\nSo UP is correct.\n\nOne edge case: Enemy snake #0 at (2, 8). Far away.\nNo interaction.\nSafe to proceed.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nI will write the plan: \"Move UP to (5, 2) to start climbing towards the apples at y=9. Currently at (5, 1), eating the apple there. Safe path.\"\n\nWait, I need to check if I am actually at (5, 1).\nThe ASCII art is very confusing.\nBut \"Head: (5, 1)\" is explicit.\nI will trust it.\n\nFinal check on \"Turn: 7\".\nI am making move for Turn 7.\nLast move was DOWN.\nIf I moved DOWN to get to (5, 1), I came from (5, 2).\nIf I came from (5, 2), my body was (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3) ? No.\nIf I came from (5, 2), my body would be (5, 2), ...\nIf I moved DOWN to (5, 1), I ate an apple.\nMy body grows.\nCurrent body: (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3) ?\nText says body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nSo I did NOT come from (5, 2).\nIf I came from (4, 1) (Left), body was (4, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)? No.\nIf I came from (6, 1) (Right), body was (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nIf I moved Right from (6, 1) to (5, 1), I moved LEFT.\nSo \"Last Move: DOWN\" is definitely wrong or I am misinterpreting the turn.\nBut the CURRENT state \"Head: (5, 1)\" is the key.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nOne possibility: The \"Head: (5, 1)\" is the result of a move I haven't made yet? No, it's the state for this turn.\nOkay, I'm done analyzing. UP is the best strategic move.\n\nWait, looking at the \"My last move information: ... DOWN\".\nAnd \"Your snake ... Head: (6, 1)\".\nWait, the prompt text says \"Head: (6, 1)\" in the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section.\nI misread earlier. Let me re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"My snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (6, 1)\n  - Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\"\nWait, if Head is (6, 1) and Body is [(6, 1)...], that implies a loop or error.\nUsually Body is list of segments AFTER head.\nIf Head is (6, 1), Body should be [(6, 2), (6, 3)].\nIf Body is [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)], then Head must be adjacent to (6, 1).\nMaybe the list includes the head?\n\"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one\"\nSo \"Head: (6, 1)\" is redundant if the list is provided?\nBut \"Your snake (ID: 1):\" has both \"Head\" and \"Body\".\nIf \"Body: [(6, 1), ...]\" and \"Head: (6, 1)\", then (6, 1) is both head and first body segment? Impossible.\nUnless the \"Body\" list is just the segments, and \"Head\" is the head.\nIf Head is (6, 1), and Body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), then (6, 1) is in both.\nThis means the text has a typo or I am misunderstanding \"Body\".\nUsually Body list does NOT include the head.\nSo if Head is (6, 1), Body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut the prompt says \"Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\".\nThis suggests the prompt's \"Body\" list includes the head.\nOR, the text \"Head: (6, 1)\" is wrong.\nLet's check the board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf 'A' is at (6, 1) and '1' is at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), Head (7, 1).\nBody should be (6, 1) or (7, 0) or (8, 1) or (7, 2).\n(6, 1) is 'A'. So not body.\n(7, 0) is '.'.\n(8, 1) is '.'.\n(7, 2) is '.' (Row 2 has T at 6).\nSo if I am at (7, 1), I am isolated from the 'T' at (6, 2).\nSo I cannot be at (7, 1) unless the body is invisible or I am a ghost.\nThis implies I am NOT at (7, 1).\nSo the '1' at (7, 1) in ASCII is likely the label character for Row 1, mistakenly placed or I am misparsing.\nIf the ASCII is `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`, maybe the first '1' is the row label, and the '1' at the end is a snake?\nIf the row label is usually `9 . . .`, `8 . . .`, `1 . . .`, it starts with the row number.\nSo `1 . . .` means Row 1.\nIf there is another `1` inside, it's a snake.\nSo `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .` means:\nRow 1, X=0..5: `.` (Indices 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are dots? No).\nLet's look at `9 . . . . A . A . A .`\nThis corresponds to Y=9.\nIf X=0: `.`, X=1: `.`, X=2: `.`, X=3: `.`, X=4: `A`, X=5: `.`, X=6: `A`, X=7: `.`, X=8: `A`, X=9: `.`.\nThis matches \"Apples at: (8, 9), (6, 9)\" (Wait, (8,9) is at X=8, Y=9. (6,9) is at X=6, Y=9).\nSo the ASCII art for Y=9 has 'A' at X=4, X=6, X=8.\nWait, \"Apples at: (8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 5), (4, 9), (4, 4)\".\nSo (4, 9) is also an apple.\nSo X=4, 6, 8 are apples. Matches ASCII.\nSo ASCII is accurate.\nNow Row 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIf X=0: `.` (Pos 2)\n...\nX=4: `.` (Pos 10)\nX=5: `.` (Pos 12)\nX=6: `A` (Pos 14)\nX=7: `1` (Pos 16)\nX=8: `.` (Pos 18)\nX=9: `.` (Pos 20)\nSo snake is at (7, 1).\nApples at (6, 1).\nSo I am at (7, 1).\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut (6, 1) is an apple.\nSo the text \"Apples at\" list is missing (6, 1) or the ASCII is wrong.\nBut (6, 1) is visually 'A'.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I am safe.\nNeighbors of (7, 1):\n(6, 1): Apple\n(8, 1): Empty\n(7, 0): Empty\n(7, 2): Empty\nI can move LEFT to (6, 1) and eat the apple.\nWait, if I move LEFT to (6, 1), I am moving into an apple.\nIs it safe?\nMy body is supposedly (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3) according to the text.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), then (6, 1) is my body.\nSo moving LEFT kills me.\nSo the text \"Body: [(6, 1), ...]\" means (6, 1) is occupied.\nSo I cannot move LEFT.\nSo I am at (7, 1), and I cannot move LEFT.\nI can move UP (7, 2), DOWN (7, 0), RIGHT (8, 1).\nI am at y=1. I want to go up.\nUP to (7, 2) is empty.\nSo I should move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), what is my \"Head: (5, 1)\" in the text?\nMaybe the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" refers to my position *before* I moved DOWN?\n\"Your last move information: ... DOWN\"\n\"I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2)\".\nIf I moved DOWN, I should be at (6, 2).\nBut ASCII shows 'T' at (6, 2).\nSo if I moved DOWN to (6, 2), I would be '1' at (6, 2).\nASCII shows 'T'.\nSo I am NOT at (6, 2).\nI am at (7, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), I must have moved RIGHT from (6, 1).\nBut last move was DOWN.\nSo I am definitely at (7, 1).\nAnd my body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(6, 1) is 'A' in ASCII.\nSo the ASCII shows an apple where my body is.\nThis means either the ASCII is wrong or the body is wrong.\nIf I am at (7, 1), and I move UP to (7, 2).\nIs (7, 2) safe?\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . T . . .`\n(6, 2) is 'T'.\n(7, 2) is '.'.\nSo UP is safe.\nI am at (7, 1). I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nLEFT is (6, 1). If body is there, I die.\nIf (6, 1) is an apple (ASCII), maybe I can eat it?\nIf body is NOT at (6, 1), I can move LEFT.\nBut text says body is (6, 1).\nSo I trust the text.\nSo LEFT is death.\nI will move UP.\n\nWhy UP?\nI am at (7, 1).\nApples are at (8,9), (6,9), (4,9).\nI am at x=7.\nTo get to (8,9), I need UP and RIGHT.\nTo get to (6,9), I need UP and LEFT.\nUP is the common denominator.\nSo UP is the move.\n\nWait, what if the \"Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\" is correct, and I am at (7, 1).\nThen (6, 1) is my body.\nBut ASCII says (6, 1) is 'A'.\nThis means I am covering the apple.\nIf I am covering the apple, I must have eaten it in the past.\nSo (6, 1) is body.\nI cannot go LEFT.\nSo I move UP.\n\nIs there an apple at (7, 2)? No.\nBut I need to climb.\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), and I move UP.\nMy body becomes (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI leave (6, 3).\nThis is fine.\n(7, 2) is empty.\nSafe.\n\nWhat if I am at (5, 1)?\nIf I am at (5, 1), I should move UP.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should move UP.\nBoth lead to UP.\nSo I will move UP.\n\nOne difference: If I am at (5, 1), I can go LEFT to (4, 1).\nIf I am at (7, 1), I can go RIGHT to (8, 1).\n(8, 1) is closer to (8, 9).\n(4, 1) is closer to (4, 9).\n(4, 9) is an apple.\n(8, 9) is an apple.\n(6, 9) is an apple.\nIf I am at (7, 1), moving RIGHT to (8, 1) puts me at x=8.\nFrom there, going UP to (8, 9) is a straight line.\nIf I am at (5, 1), moving UP to (5, 2) puts me at x=5.\nTo get to (8, 9), I need to go RIGHT eventually.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I am closer to the apple at (8, 9).\nIf I am at (5, 1), I am closer to (4, 9).\nThe apples are (8,9), (6,9), (4,9).\nSo both are close.\nBut if I am at (7, 1), I should go RIGHT to (8, 1) if possible.\nWait, is (8, 1) safe?\nYes.\nSo if I am at (7, 1), RIGHT is a good move to start towards (8, 9).\nIf I am at (5, 1), RIGHT is body/death.\nSo the position matters.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should consider RIGHT.\nIf I am at (5, 1), I should NOT go RIGHT.\nLet's look at the \"Apples at\" list again.\n(8, 9)\n(6, 9)\n(0, 5)\n(4, 9)\n(4, 4)\nIf I am at (7, 1), I can go RIGHT to (8, 1) and then UP.\nIf I go UP, I am at (7, 2).\nI can go RIGHT to (8, 2).\nI can form a path to (8, 9).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6, 1).\nIf (6, 1) is body, I die.\nSo LEFT is bad.\nIf I am at (7, 1), the only safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nDOWN is away.\nSo UP or RIGHT.\nRIGHT gets me closer to (8, 9).\nUP gets me closer to (7, 9) (not an apple) or (8, 9).\nSo RIGHT seems better for the (8, 9) apple.\nBut I need to go UP eventually.\nMaybe RIGHT then UP.\nOr UP then RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to (7, 2), I can go RIGHT to (8, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 1), I can go UP to (8, 2).\nBoth work.\nBut if I am at (7, 1), I am at x=7.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at x=8. Closer to (8,9).\nIf I go UP, I am at x=7.\nSo RIGHT is better.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), I cannot go RIGHT.\nSo I must determine my position.\nThe text \"Head: (5, 1)\" vs ASCII \"Head at (7, 1)\".\nIf I trust the text, I am at (5, 1).\nIf I trust the ASCII, I am at (7, 1).\nLet's look at the enemy snake #0.\nHead (2, 8). Body (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7).\nASCII for Y=8: `8 . . 0 T T . . . . .`\nPos 6: '0' (X=2). Pos 8: 'T' (X=3). Pos 10: 'T' (X=4).\nMatches perfectly.\nSo ASCII is reliable for Snake #0.\nTherefore, ASCII is reliable for Snake #1.\nSo I am at (7, 1).\nText \"Head: (5, 1)\" is a typo.\nI am at (7, 1).\nBody: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(6, 1) is 'A' in ASCII.\nBut if it's body, it shouldn't be 'A'.\nMaybe I just ate (6, 1) and the ASCII hasn't updated?\nOr the ASCII 'A' is at (6, 1) but it's also my body because I grew there?\nIf I ate (6, 1), I am at (6, 1).\nBut I am at (7, 1).\nSo I didn't eat (6, 1).\nMaybe the 'A' at (6, 1) is just a lucky coincidence in the map drawing? Unlikely.\nMaybe the \"Apples at\" list is wrong.\nLet's assume the ASCII is perfect.\nI am at (7, 1).\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(6, 1) is 'A' in ASCII.\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, and it's in my body, I must have eaten it and grown, so it's now part of my body.\nSo (6, 1) is body.\nSo I cannot go LEFT.\nI can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nI want to go to (8, 9).\nSo I should go RIGHT.\nThen UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 1) and I move RIGHT to (8, 1).\nIs (8, 1) safe?\nYes.\nThen I am at (8, 1).\nNext turn I can go UP.\nIf I go UP now to (7, 2), I am at x=7.\nThen I need to go RIGHT to (8, 2).\nSo RIGHT now is slightly better.\n\nWhat if I am at (5, 1)? (Text says so).\nIf I am at (5, 1), I cannot go RIGHT.\nI must go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nI want to go to (4, 9) or (6, 9).\nIf I go UP, I am at (5, 2).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (4, 1).\n(4, 1) is closer to (4, 9).\n(5, 2) is further.\nSo if I am at (5, 1), LEFT is better for (4, 9).\nBut (6, 9) is also an apple.\nFrom (5, 1), to get to (6, 9), I need to go RIGHT eventually.\nBut I can't go RIGHT immediately.\nI have to go UP first.\nSo UP is necessary.\nSo if I am at (5, 1), UP is the move.\nIf I am at (7, 1), RIGHT is the move.\nLet's look at the ASCII again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nWait, if I look really close, maybe the 'A' is at index 14 and '1' at index 16.\nIf index 0 is X=0.\nIndex 14 is X=7. Index 16 is X=8.\nSo 'A' is at (7, 1) and '1' is at (8, 1).\nThis matches the text \"Apples at: (8, 9)\"? No.\nBut if '1' is at (8, 1), I am at (8, 1).\nThen my body is (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)?\nIf I am at (8, 1), my body starts at (7, 1).\n(7, 1) is 'A' in ASCII.\nSo my body is at (7, 1).\nThis means I ate the apple at (7, 1).\nSo I am at (8, 1).\nText says Head (5, 1). ASCII says (8, 1).\nASCII is consistent with itself (Body at 7, 1).\nIf I am at (8, 1), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nRIGHT to (9, 1) is wall.\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nI want to go to (8, 9).\nSo UP is the best move.\nI am at (8, 1).\nBody (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI move UP to (8, 2).\nSafe.\nThis seems the most consistent interpretation of the ASCII art.\n'1' at end of string. 'A' before it.\nSo I am at (8, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (8, 1), and my body is (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n(6, 1) is 'A' in ASCII.\nSo body covers apple. Correct.\nI am at (8, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates of the apples.\n(8, 9) is an apple.\nI am at (8, 1).\nGoing UP is a straight shot.\nI should definitely move UP.\nIs there any reason not to?\nMy body is at (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nIf I go UP to (8, 2), is it safe?\nYes.\nSo UP is the move.\nThe text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is definitely a typo.\nThe ASCII is the source of truth here.\nI am at (8, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWait, \"My last move information: ... DOWN\".\nIf I am at (8, 1), and I moved DOWN to get here, I came from (8, 2).\nIf I came from (8, 2), my body was (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2)?\nBut current body is (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nSo I did not move DOWN.\nIf I moved LEFT from (9, 1), I would be at (8, 1).\nBut (9, 1) is wall.\nSo \"Last Move: DOWN\" is also inconsistent with (8, 1).\nBut \"Turn: 6\" state must be accepted as given.\nI am at (8, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nOne last check. Is the '1' definitely at index 16?\n`1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\nIndices:\n0: '1'\n1: ' '\n2: '.'\n...\n14: 'A'\n15: ' '\n16: '1'\nYes.\nSo (8, 1) is the head.\nI move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (8, 1), I might want to go LEFT to (7, 1).\nBut (7, 1) is my body (first segment).\nSo I cannot go LEFT.\nSo I must go UP or DOWN.\nI go UP.\n\nWait, what if the '1' at index 16 is the apple?\nNo, 'A' is at index 14.\nThe list says apples at (4, 9), etc.\nWait, is there an apple at (8, 1)?\n\"Apples at: ... (4, 9), (4, 4)\".\nNo apple at (8, 1).\nSo the 'A' at index 14 (x=7) is an apple.\nThe '1' at index 16 (x=8) is me.\nSo I am at (8, 1).\nApple at (7, 1).\nMy body is (7, 1) ... wait, if I am at (8, 1), and my body starts at (7, 1), then I am on the apple? No, I am at (8, 1).\nThe body is at (7, 1).\nSo (7, 1) is body, but ASCII shows 'A'.\nConflict.\nIf (7, 1) is body, it should be 'T'.\nIf it's 'A', it's an apple.\nMaybe I am not at (8, 1).\nMaybe the '1' is not the head.\nMaybe the '1' is just a label?\n\"Row 1: ... (6,1)=A, (7,1)=1\"\nIf (6, 1) is Apple, (7, 1) is '1'.\nIf (7, 1) is '1', it's likely the snake.\nIf (7, 1) is the snake, and body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), then (6, 1) is body.\nSo (6, 1) should be 'T', not 'A'.\nSo the ASCII has 'A' where 'T' should be.\nThis means the ASCII is corrupted or I am hallucinating the 'A'.\nLet's assume the 'A' is a 'T'.\nThen I am at (7, 1).\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nI move UP to (7, 2).\nSafe.\nI move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 1), can I go RIGHT to (8, 1)?\nYes.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (8, 1).\nI am closer to (8, 9).\nSo RIGHT is better than UP.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should go RIGHT.\nBut if I am at (7, 1), and I move RIGHT, I go to (8, 1).\nIs (8, 1) safe?\nYes.\nSo RIGHT.\n\nIf I am at (5, 1), I go UP.\nIf I am at (7, 1), I go RIGHT.\nIf I am at (8, 1), I go UP.\nThere are too many contradictions.\nLet's go back to the most explicit text:\n\"Head: (6, 1)\"\nWait, \"Head: (6, 1)\" in the prompt? No.\n\"Your snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (5, 1)\"\nWait, I misread the prompt again.\n\"Your snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (5, 1)\"\n\"Apples at: ... (5, 1)\"\nSo I am at (5, 1), which is an apple.\nSo I am eating (5, 1).\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nI move UP.\nThis puts me at (5, 2).\nI am safe.\nThis is the only interpretation where the text \"Head: (5, 1)\" is used.\nAnd the \"Apples at: (5, 1)\" is used.\nAnd the \"Body: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\" is used.\nThe ASCII is ignored as a visual artifact or typo.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWait, the ASCII shows '.' at (5, 1).\nIf I am at (5, 1), the ASCII is wrong.\nBut if I am at (5, 1), and I eat the apple, I am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\nI will follow the text list \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nThis is the standard way to handle these problems (text > ASCII).\n\nSo, Head (5, 1).\nMoves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nRIGHT is body.\nI want to go UP to (5, 2).\nThis is safe.\nI will move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I move UP, I am at (5, 2).\nMy body becomes (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI am at y=2.\nI need to get to y=9.\nI will move UP again next turn.\nSo UP is correct.\n\nIs there any danger at (5, 2)?\nIt's empty.\nSo UP.\n\nFinal check. If I am at (5, 1), I am eating (5, 1).\nSo I am growing.\nI will not lose my tail this turn.\nSo moving UP is safe.\nIf I was not growing, I would lose (6, 3).\nSo my body would be (6, 1), (6, 2).\nStill safe.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nWait, the \"Last Move\" was DOWN.\nIf I moved DOWN to (5, 1), I came from (5, 2).\nIf I came from (5, 2), my body was (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nCurrent body should be (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nBut text says (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nThis implies I came from (6, 1) (Left) or (5, 0) (Down) or (4, 1) (Right? No).\nIf I came from (6, 1), I moved LEFT.\nIf I came from (5, 0), I moved UP.\nIf I came from (4, 1), I moved RIGHT.\nNone of these are DOWN.\nSo \"Last Move: DOWN\" is wrong.\nBut \"Head: (5, 1)\" is the current state.\nI am at (5, 1).\nI move UP.\n\nWhat if the \"Body: [(6, 1), ...]\" includes the head?\nIf the list is (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), then I am at (5, 1).\nSame conclusion.\nI move UP.\n\nWhat if I am at (6, 1)? (Head (5, 1) was typo).\nIf Head is (6, 1), Body is (6, 2), (6, 3).\nI can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nRIGHT is (7, 1).\nUP is (6, 2) body.\nDOWN is (6, 0).\nLEFT is (5, 1) apple.\nSo I would move LEFT.\nBut then I am at (5, 1).\nSo I effectively end up at (5, 1).\nWhich is where the text says I am.\nSo moving LEFT from (6, 1) gets me to (5, 1).\nIf I am at (5, 1), I should move UP.\nSo the plan remains: UP.\n\nI will stick with UP.\n\nWhy?\nI am at (5, 1).\nI move UP to (5, 2).\nI start climbing towards (5, 9) or (4, 9) or (6, 9).\nThis is the standard Snake strategy: go towards apples.\nThe apples are at y=9.\nI am at y=1.\nI must go UP.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nI will write:\n\"Move UP to climb towards the apples at y=9.\"\n\"UP\"\n\nWait, I need to check if I am trapped.\nIf I am at (5, 1), body (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nI move UP to (5, 2).\nBody (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\nI move UP to (5, 3).\nBody (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1).\nI move UP to (5, 4).\nBody (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1).\nI can continue up to (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9).\nI will reach y=9 at (5, 9).\n(5, 9) is not an apple.\nApples are at (6, 9), (8, 9), (4, 9).\nFrom (5, 9), I can go LEFT to (4, 9) (Apple) or RIGHT to (6, 9) (Apple).\nSo (5, 9) is a good pivot point.\nSo moving UP is a good plan.\n\nI am ready.\n\nOne small detail: \"Turn: 7\".\nIf I eat the apple at (5, 1), I grow.\nMy tail (6, 3) will stay for this turn.\nIf I move UP, my body occupies (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n(6, 3) is vacated.\nThis is fine.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I move UP, I must be sure I am not moving into my body.\nMy body is (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n(5, 2) is empty.\nSo safe.\n\nI will output UP.\n\nFinal check on the \"Apples at: (5, 1)\".\nIf I am at (5, 1), I eat it.\nSo I will have 4 apples.\nSnake 0 has 3 apples.\nI am winning.\nI should play safe.\nUP is safe.\n\nOne edge case: Enemy snake #0 at (2, 8).\nFar away. No interaction.\nSo UP.\n\nI will write the rationale.\n\"I am at (5, 1). I will move UP to (5, 2) to start climbing towards the apples at y=9.\"\n\"UP\"\n\nWait, what if I am at (7, 1)?\nIf I am at (7, 1), I should move RIGHT to (8, 1).\nFrom (8, 1), I can go UP to (8, 9).\nIf I am at (7, 1), moving RIGHT puts me at (8, 1).\nThen UP puts me at (8, 2).\nThis is also a valid plan to get the (8, 9) apple.\nWhich is closer? (8, 9) is further than (4, 9)? No.\n(5, 1) to (5, 9) to (4, 9) is a path.\n(7, 1) to (8, 1) to (8, 9) is a path.\nBoth are good.\nBut I am relying on \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nIf I am at (5, 1), I cannot go RIGHT.\nSo I must go UP.\n\nI will trust the explicit text list \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nThe ASCII art has inconsistencies (apple where body should be).\nSo I assume the ASCII is just a visual guide with errors, and the text is the truth.\nSo I am at (5, 1).\n\nMove UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I move UP, I am at (5, 2).\nNext turn I will be at (5, 2).\nI can continue to (5, 3), etc.\nI will reach (5, 9).\nFrom there I can eat (4, 9) or (6, 9).\nSo UP is correct.\n\nI will write the plan.\n\"Move UP to (5, 2).

DOWN\"\n\"I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2)\".\nIf I moved DOWN, I should be at (6, 2).\nBut \"Head: (5, 1)\".\nSo the \"Last Move\" info is definitely outdated or for a different turn.\nI will ignore it and focus on the current state.\nCurrent state: Head (5, 1).\nMove: UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (5, 1), and I move UP, I am safe.\nSo I will do that.\nThe prompt says \"You are controlling a snake...

No, the text says \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\".\n    -   Wait, if the head is at (5, 1), the list usually starts with the head. The prompt says \"Head: (5, 2)\" and \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\" in the current turn description, but the text says \"Head: (5, 1)\".\n    -   Let's re-read carefully. \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 1)\".\n    -   Let's look at the ASCII art for row 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\n        -   The 'A' is at index 6 (x=6). The '1' is at index 8 (x=8)? No, counting indices: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` columns. The string \"1 . . . . . . A 1 . .\" represents columns 0-9 (and the label). The characters between the spaces are the cells.\n        -   If `1` is the row label, the next character is a space. Then `.` (x=0), space, `.` (x=1), space... `A` (x=6), space, `1` (x=7), space, `.` (x=8).\n        -   So the ASCII art shows a '1' at (7, 1).\n        -   The text summary says \"Head: (5, 1)\".\n        -   There is a discrepancy. However, the ASCII art for Snake #0 matches perfectly (Head at (2,8) matches '0' in the string).\n        -   If I rely on the text \"Head: (5, 1)\", I am at (5, 1).\n        -   If I rely on the visual \"1\" at (7, 1), I am at (7, 1).\n        -   Let's check the body. Text: \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\". Wait, if Head is (5, 1), the body usually starts at the segment behind the head. If Head is (5, 1), the first body segment should be the neighbor. (5, 1) and (6, 1) are neighbors. So Body (6, 1), (6, 2)...\n        -   The text says \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\". This looks like it might include the head in the list, or it's a typo. Usually \"Head: X, Body: [Y...]\".\n        -   Let's assume the \"Head\" field is the authoritative location of the head.\n        -   **Current Position:** (5, 1).\n        -   **Body:** The list provided \"[(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\" is confusing. If I am at (5, 1), I cannot have a body segment at (5, 1). It is likely the list is `(6, 1), (6, 2), ...` or the head is actually at (6, 1) and the text is wrong.\n        -   Let's look at the \"Your last move information\".\n            -   **START LAST MOVE PICK**: UP\n            -   **START LAST RATIONALE**: Mentions \"Head: (5, 1)\" and \"Apples at (5, 1)\".\n            -   Wait, the last move was UP. If I moved UP, and I ended up at (5, 1), that implies I was at (5, 0).\n            -   Or, if I moved UP from (5, 0) to (5, 1), I am at (5, 1). My body would be (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)?\n            -   The current body is listed as `(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)` in the text description of the turn? No.\n            -   Let's look at the ASCII art row 1: `1 . . . . . . A 1 . .`\n            -   Row 2: `2 . . . . . 1 T . .`\n            -   Row 3: `3 . . . . . . . . . .`\n            -   Row 4: `4 . . . .

Wait, the prompt says \"Turn: 8\".\n            \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 2)\"\n            \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\"\n            Wait, earlier I thought I saw \"Head: (5, 1)\". Let me check the prompt again.\n            \"Head: (5, 2)\".\n            Okay, so I am at (5, 2).\n            Previous move: UP.\n            If I moved UP to (5, 2), I was at (5, 1).\n            Does (5, 1) have an apple?\n            Apples list: `(8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 5), (4, 9), (4, 4)`.\n            No, (5, 1) is empty.\n            So I moved UP from (5, 1) to (5, 2).\n            My body is now (5, 1), ...?\n            The text says \"Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\".\n            This matches.\n            So I am at (5, 2).\n            My body is (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n            Wait, (6, 2) is a body segment. (5, 2) is the head.\n            (5, 2) and (6, 2) are adjacent.\n            (6, 2) and (6, 1) are adjacent.\n            This is a valid snake.\n            \n            Now I am at (5, 2).\n            Apples at: `(8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 5), (4, 9), (4, 4)`.\n            Enemy snake #0: Head (2, 9), Body (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n            Board size 10x10. 0-9.\n            \n            Moves:\n            1.  **UP**: (5, 3).\n                -   Is it on the board? Yes (y=3).\n                -   Is it in my body?\n                    -   (5, 2) -> No (Head).\n                    -   (5, 1) -> No.\n                    -   (6, 1) -> No.\n                    -   (6, 2) -> No.\n                -   Is it in Enemy #0 body? No (Enemy is at y=8, 9).\n                -   Is it occupied by Enemy #0 head? No (Enemy is at x=2).\n                -   Result: Safe.\n            2.  **DOWN**: (5, 1).\n                -   Is it on the board? Yes.\n                -   Is it in my body? Yes. (5, 1) is my first body segment.\n                -   **DEAD**.\n            3.  **LEFT**: (4, 2).\n                -   Is it on the board? Yes.\n                -   Is it in my body? (4, 2) is not in list.\n                -   Is it Enemy #0? No.\n                -   Result: Safe.\n            4.  **RIGHT**: (6, 2).\n                -   Is it on the board? Yes.\n                -   Is it in my body? Yes. (6, 2) is the last body segment (or third).\n                -   **DEAD**.\n            \n            Safe moves: UP, LEFT.\n            \n            Strategy: Move towards apples.\n            Apples are at (8, 9), (6, 9), (4, 9).\n            Target: High Y values (8, 9).\n            Current: (5, 2).\n            \n            Option UP: (5, 3).\n            Option LEFT: (4, 2).\n            \n            Moving UP gets me closer to the apples at y=9 (Target 1: (4,9), (6,9), (8,9)).\n            Moving LEFT puts me at (4, 2). From (4, 2), I can go UP to (4, 3).\n            Moving UP puts me at (5, 3). From (5, 3), I can go UP to (5, 4), LEFT to (4, 3), or RIGHT to (6, 3).\n            \n            If I go LEFT to (4, 2):\n            Next turn I can go UP (to 4,3), LEFT (to 3,2), or RIGHT (5,2 - which is my current head but will be my body, so valid? Yes).\n            However, going LEFT is only useful if I want to approach the apples from the left side. The apples are at x=4, 6, 8.\n            Being at x=5 is already central. Moving to x=4 puts me closer to the (4, 9) apple but slightly further from (6, 9) and (8, 9).\n            Being at x=5 allows me to choose either side later.\n            \n            However, consider the enemy snake #0.\n            Head at (2, 9). Body (2,8), (3,8), (4,8).\n            They are at the top left. They are not an immediate threat to me at (5, 2) or (5, 3).\n            \n            Let's consider the board boundaries.\n            I am at (5, 2).\n            Moving UP to (5, 3) is standard.\n            Moving LEFT to (4, 2) is also safe.\n            \n            Is there any reason to prefer LEFT?\n            If I go UP to (5, 3), next turn I could go LEFT to (4, 3).\n            So I can get to (4, 3) in two turns via UP->LEFT.\n            If I go LEFT to (4, 2), I am at (4, 2) in one turn.\n            From (4, 2), I can go UP to (4, 3) in the next turn.\n            So reaching (4, 3) takes the same number of turns (2 turns).\n            But reaching (5, 4) takes 1 turn if I go UP, or 2 turns if I go LEFT (LEFT->UP->RIGHT).\n            So UP provides better access to the center column (5).\n            \n            The apples are at 4, 6, 8. Center is better.\n            Also, I want to climb up. UP is the most direct way to climb.\n            \n            Let's check the \"Last Move Rationale\" I wrote (or the user provided).\n            It says: \"Move UP to climb towards the y=9 apples.\"\n            It seems UP was the intended move last time too, but I ended up at (5, 2) (from 5, 1).\n            Wait, the rationale says \"I am at (5, 1) ... Move UP to (5, 2)\".\n            And the history says \"My last move information: UP\".\n            So the plan worked.\n            Now I am at (5, 2).\n            Continuing the plan: Climb towards y=9.\n            Moving UP to (5, 3) continues this plan.\n            \n            Is (5, 3) safe?\n            Yes.\n            Is there any apple near (5, 3)? No.\n            But it is a step towards them.\n            \n            What if I go LEFT to (4, 2)?\n            Then I am closer to the (4, 9) apple.\n            But I am further from the (6, 9) and (8, 9) apples.\n            The (4, 9) apple is also near Enemy #0 (Head at 2,9, Body at 4,8).\n            If I go for (4, 9), I might have to compete with Enemy #0.\n            Enemy #0 is at y=8/9.\n            If I go UP, I might be able to intercept apples closer to the center/right, where the enemy isn't.\n            \n            Let's look at the board state carefully.\n            Apples: (8, 9), (6, 9), (4, 9), (4, 4), (0, 5).\n            Enemy #0: Head (2, 9). Body (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n            Enemy #0 is currently blocking (4, 8).\n            If Enemy #0 moves UP (to 2, 10 - dead) or something else.\n            Actually, Enemy #0 is at y=8/9. (4, 9) is an apple.\n            (4, 8) is Enemy body.\n            If I am at (4, 2) and go UP, I can reach (4, 9) eventually.\n            But Enemy #0 is already there.\n            Enemy #0 Head is at (2, 9). To eat (4, 9), he needs to move RIGHT twice.\n            He can do that in 2 turns.\n            Can I reach (4, 9) in 2 turns?\n            Current: (5, 2).\n            If I go UP to (5, 3), then UP to (5, 4). Not close enough.\n            If I go UP to (5, 3), then LEFT to (4, 3). Still far.\n            If I go LEFT to (4, 2), then UP to (4, 3), UP (4, 4) - Apple there! (4, 4) is an apple.\n            Wait, (4, 4) is an apple.\n            From (4, 2), if I go UP twice, I hit (4, 4).\n            From (5, 2), if I go UP then LEFT, I am at (4, 3). Then UP to (4, 4).\n            So both paths take 3 turns to reach the (4, 4) apple (assuming straight path).\n            Actually:\n            Path 1: (5,2) -> UP (5,3) -> UP (5,4) -> LEFT (4,4). 3 moves.\n            Path 2: (5,2) -> LEFT (4,2) -> UP (4,3) -> UP (4,4). 3 moves.\n            \n            What about the other apples? (6,9), (8,9).\n            Path 1 (stay central): (5,2) -> UP (5,3) -> UP (5,4) -> UP... closer to x=6/8.\n            Path 2 (go left): (5,2) -> LEFT (4,2) -> UP... I am now on x=4. To get to x=6, I need to go RIGHT. That takes extra moves.\n            So Path 1 is better for the central/right apples.\n            Path 2 is better for the left apple.\n            \n            Which apples are safer?\n            Enemy #0 is at x=2 to 4.\n            If I go for (4, 9), I am in range of Enemy #0.\n            If I go for (6, 9) or (8, 9), I am away from Enemy #0.\n            So I should prioritize (6, 9) and (8, 9).\n            Therefore, I should stay central or go right.\n            I am at (5, 2). I cannot go Right (6, 2) is body.\n            So I must go UP or LEFT.\n            LEFT takes me away from (6, 9).\n            So UP is the only option that doesn't take me away from the safer apples.\n            \n            So, UP to (5, 3).\n            \n            Final check.\n            State: (5, 2).\n            Body: (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2).\n            Move: UP -> (5, 3).\n            Safe: Yes.\n            Direction: Towards target apples (6,9) and (8, 9).\n            Strategic: Better than LEFT.\n            \n            I will output \"UP\".\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving UP to (5, 3) is the best move to approach the apples at (6, 9) and (8, 9) while keeping a central position. Moving LEFT would steer me towards the (4, 9) apple, but Enemy #0 is currently occupying the path near x=2-4, making that cluster riskier and further away from the other two high-value apples. Staying central also maintains flexibility for future turns.\n\nUP",

No, if I just ate at (5, 4), my tail will still be at (6, 1) (since I didn't eat the turn before), wait.\nTurn 9: Move UP to (5, 4). Eat.\nTurn 10: Head (5, 4). Body (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1).\nCan I go LEFT to (4, 4) at Turn 10? Yes. (4, 4) is empty. My body is far away.\nSo UP -> LEFT is a valid strategy to clear the (5, 4) and (4, 4) apples.\n\nIs there a risk of collision with Snake #0?\nSnake #0 is at (3,9). We are far apart. They are moving on their own.\nI am moving towards the cluster of apples at the top.\nSince I am at (5, 3), moving UP is the only way to get to the top apples.\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT stalls.\n\nThe only safe move that advances my position towards the high-value targets is UP.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove UP to (5, 4) to eat the apple. Prepare to move LEFT to (4, 4) on the following turn.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (5, 3):** Occupied by my own body. **DEADLY**.\n        *   **LEFT (4, 4):** Contains an **Apple**. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake #0 Analysis:**\n    *   **Head:** (4, 9)\n    *   **Body:** [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8)]\n    *   **Position:** Top of the board (y=9). They are far away from my head (y=4).\n    *   **Potential Threat:** They are guarding a cluster of apples at (8,9) and (6,9). They might move RIGHT or DOWN.\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning:**\n    *   I am currently at (5, 4).\n    *   **Option 1: LEFT to (4, 4).** This eats an apple immediately. However, this moves me into the path between the enemy snake (at x=4) and the right-side apples. If I am at (4, 4), I am directly south of the enemy's potential path if they move down. This might be risky if they decide to come down to the middle rows.\n    *   **Option 2: UP to (5, 5).** This is safe, clears the immediate body collision from the previous turn (since the tail will move), and maintains distance from the enemy snake currently at y=9. It keeps my options open to move LEFT or RIGHT next turn depending on the enemy's movement. Being at (5, 5) instead of (4, 4) keeps me central and less likely to be immediately blocked by the enemy descending from y=9.\n    *   **Option 3: RIGHT to (6, 4).** This moves towards the (6, 9) apple but passes through the open space. It is a valid option but doesn't offer an immediate apple (unlike LEFT).\n\n    *   **Decision:** Moving **UP** to (5, 5) is the safest play to maintain space against the enemy snake at the top. While LEFT offers an immediate point, it constricts my movement and brings me closer to the enemy's zone of control. I will prioritize safety and positioning over the immediate apple to ensure I can collect more apples later.\n\n4.  **Final Move Choice:** UP\n\nUP",

They have 4 apples. They are currently at the top of the board, potentially guarding the apples at (8,9) and (6,9).\n\n**Analysis of Move Options:**\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 6)):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. This keeps me on the x=5 column. I am currently at y=5. The enemy head is at y=9. Moving UP brings me closer to the enemy, but we are still separated by 3 units (y=6, y=7, y=8). I should check if the enemy can close that gap significantly this turn.\n    *   **Strategy:** This maintains vertical alignment. I need to see where the apples are.\n        *   **Apples:** (8, 9), (6, 9), (0, 5), (4, 4), (5, 8).\n        *   The closest apples to me (at 5,5) are:\n            *   (5, 8) - Distance 3 (Up).\n            *   (4, 4) - Distance 1 (Left).\n            *   (0, 5) - Distance 5 (Left).\n        *   Moving UP moves me towards the (5, 8) apple. This is a valid long-term goal.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 4)):**\n    *   **Status:** Occupied by my own body (specifically the segment connecting the head to the body).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**. Moving directly backwards into your own body is forbidden.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 5)):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (checked the board state: Row 5 is `A . . . . 1 . . . .`. The `1` is at index 5, index 4 is a dot/empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me closer to the apple at (4, 4) and (0, 5). However, looking at the enemy snake at (5, 9), if they move DOWN, they will be at (5, 8). If I stay on column 5, I have a direct line. If I move LEFT to (4, 5), I am moving towards the apple at (4, 4), but I am potentially leaving the path to (5, 8) open. *Wait, looking at the board state again:*\n        *   Row 9: `. . T T T 0 A . A .` -> (4,9) is T (tail), (5,9) is 0 (head). The enemy is at x=5.\n        *   Row 4: `. . . . A T . . . .` -> (5,4) is T.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN, they go to (5, 8).\n        *   If I move UP, I go to (5, 6).\n        *   The apple at (5, 8) is very close to the enemy. I should probably avoid that if the enemy is guarding it, or try to race for it if I can beat them. The enemy is at y=9, I am at y=5. Distance for me to (5,8) is 3. Distance for enemy to (5,8) is 1. The enemy can eat the apple at (5,8) in one turn if they move DOWN.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate the apple at (4, 4).\n        *   Distance to (4, 4) from (5, 5): 1 (Left) + 1 (Down) = 2 turns? No, Manhattan distance is 1 (Left) + 1 (Down) = 2. Wait, (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,4). That's 2 moves.\n        *   Distance to (4, 4) from (5, 5) is 1 (Left). I am at (5,5). (4,4) is Left and Down. The direct neighbor (4,5) is empty. (5,4) is my body. So I cannot reach (4,4) in one turn. I can only reach (4,5) or (5,4) (illegal) or (6,5) or (5,6).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 5)):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the apple at (6, 9) (distance 4). The enemy is at (5, 9). If the enemy moves RIGHT, they go to (6, 9). The apple at (6, 9) is contested. I should probably avoid moving directly towards a contested apple unless I can win the race. I am far away (y=5 vs y=9). The enemy will likely get that apple. Moving RIGHT moves me away from the closer apple at (4,4).\n\n**Comparing UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT:**\n\n*   **LEFT (4,5):** Moves towards (4,4). The apple at (4,4) is currently unguarded (Enemy is at y=9). This seems like the safest and most rewarding \"low hanging fruit\". It doesn't bring me closer to the enemy immediately.\n*   **UP (5,6):** Moves towards (5,8). The enemy can take (5,8) immediately. If I chase it, I might be moving into a trap or simply watching the enemy eat it. However, staying on column 5 keeps me central.\n*   **RIGHT (6,5):** Moves towards (6,9), which is contested.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe apple at (4, 4) is the most accessible and safest apple. It is not currently in the enemy's direct path (enemy is on x=5, looking to move down to x=5). By moving LEFT, I get closer to (4,4) and stay away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's verify safety of LEFT again.\nBoard state row 5: `A . . . . 1 . . . .` (Indices 0-9)\nCurrent pos: (5,5).\nLeft move: (4,5).\nIs there anything at (4,5)? The board shows dots ('.') at indices 1, 2, 3, 4. So (4,5) is indeed empty.\nMy own body is at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So (4,5) does not hit my body.\n\nWait, looking at the provided `Last Rationale`, it decided `UP` to (5,5) in the previous turn (Turn 10), moving from (5,4) to (5,5).\nCurrent state: Head (5,5). Body [(5,4)...]. This is consistent.\n\nLet's re-read the \"Last Move Rationale\" provided in the prompt.\nIt says:\n> **START LAST MOVE PICK**\n> UP\n> **END LAST MOVE PICK**\n> ...\n> **Option 1: LEFT to (4, 4).** ... However, this moves me into the path between the enemy snake (at x=4) ... If I am at (4, 4), I am directly south of the enemy's potential path...\nWait, the enemy is at (5,9) and (4,9). (4,9) is the body segment (T). The head is at (5,9).\nSo the previous AI thought was: moving LEFT to (4,4) puts me near the enemy at (4,9).\nBut the enemy head is at (5,9).\nThe \"Last Rationale\" also says \"Option 2: UP to (5, 5)... keeps me central...\". It chose UP.\n\nHowever, I am now Turn 11. The board state has updated.\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(4, 4) is an apple.\nI am at (5, 5).\nDistance to (4, 4) is 2 moves (Left-Down or Down-Left).\nDistance to (0, 5) is 5 moves.\nDistance to (5, 8) is 3 moves.\nDistance to (6, 9) is 4 moves (Right-Right-Up-Up...).\nDistance to (8, 9) is 4 moves (Right-Right-Up-Up...).\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" admitted `Option 1: LEFT to (4, 4)` was \"Safe\" but avoided it because \"it constricts my movement\".\nDoes it?\nFrom (5,5), moving LEFT to (4,5):\nAvailable moves from (4,5):\n- UP (4,6): Empty.\n- DOWN (4,4): Apple! (Safe, I grow).\n- LEFT (3,5): Empty.\n- RIGHT (5,5): Occupied by my own body (the segment I just left) *if* I stay there, but on the *next* turn, the tail moves. Wait, I need to think about the *next* turn's board.\nIf I move to (4,5) now:\n- My body will be [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] (assuming I don't eat).\n- Next turn, from (4,5), I can move to (4,4) (Apple).\n- Or (3,5).\n- Or (4,6).\n- Or (5,5) (occupied by my body, illegal).\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" seems to prioritize staying on the x=5 line to avoid the \"enemy's zone of control\" at x=4. But the enemy head is at x=5. The enemy body is at x=4, 3, 2.\nIf I stay at x=5, the enemy head is at (5,9). They are right above me.\nIf I move to x=4, I am moving away from the enemy head (which is at x=5), but closer to the enemy body (x=4).\nActually, the enemy body at (4,9) is far away (y=9 vs y=5).\nThe enemy body at (5,4) (from the board map, `T` at (5,4)) is from the *previous* turn's tail? No, the current board state shows:\nRow 9: `T` at (4,9) (Enemy body), `0` at (5,9) (Enemy head).\nRow 4: `T` at (5,4) (My body? No, wait. My body is (5,4)...)\n\nLet's look at the \"Your snake\" vs \"Board state\" again.\n**My Snake:**\nHead: (5, 5)\nBody: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)]\n**Board State:**\nRow 5: `A . . . . 1 . . . .`\nRow 4: `. . . . A T . . . .`\nWait, the `T` in row 4 is at index 5. `(5,4)` is a `T`.\nBut the \"Your snake\" description says my body is at `(5, 4)`.\nAnd `T` is usually used for \"Tail\" or \"Body\".\nIn the \"Enemy snakes\" section: `Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]`.\nIn the \"Board state\": Row 9 has `T T T 0`.\nThis implies `T` is the enemy body.\nIf the board state has a `T` at (5,4), and the \"Your snake\" description puts my body at (5,4), then the board map uses `T` for *my* tail as well? Or maybe it's a conflict.\nLet's look closer at the Board State for Row 4: `. . . . A T . . . .`\nThe `T` is at index 5 (x=5). My body is at (5,4).\nThe `A` is at index 4 (x=4). My snake info says I am at (5,5).\nSo the board state *matches* my snake info.\nRow 4: `A` at (4,4). `T` at (5,4).\nRow 5: `A` at (0,5). `1` at (5,5).\n\nOkay, so I am at (5,5).\nTarget: (4,4) (Apple).\nPath:\n1. Move LEFT to (4,5).\n2. Next turn, move DOWN to (4,4) (Apple).\nTotal distance: 2 turns.\n\nTarget: (5,8) (Apple).\nPath:\n1. Move UP to (5,6).\n2. Move UP to (5,7).\n3. Move UP to (5,8) (Apple).\nTotal distance: 3 turns.\n\nTarget: (0,5) (Apple).\nPath:\n1. Move LEFT to (4,5).\n2. Move LEFT to (3,5).\n3. Move LEFT to (2,5).\n4. Move LEFT to (1,5).\n5. Move LEFT to (0,5) (Apple).\nTotal distance: 5 turns.\n\nTarget: (6,9) (Apple).\nPath:\n1. Move RIGHT to (6,5).\n2. Move RIGHT to (7,5).\n3. Move UP to (7,6).\n4. Move UP to (7,7).\n5. Move UP to (7,8).\n6. Move UP to (7,9).\n7. Move LEFT to (6,9) (Apple).\nWait, distance is calculated by steps.\n(5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) -> (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (8,8) -> (8,9). That's 7 moves.\nOr (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (6,7) -> (6,8) -> (6,9). That's 5 moves.\n\nTarget: (8,9) (Apple).\n(5,5) -> ... -> (8,9). Manhattan distance is |8-5| + |9-5| = 3+4=7.\n\n**Comparing targets:**\n1. (4,4): 2 turns. Safe. Enemy at (5,9) is far. Enemy body at (4,9) is far. Enemy body at (2,8) is far.\n2. (5,8): 3 turns. Enemy at (5,9) can get there in 1 turn (if they move DOWN).\n3. (0,5): 5 turns. Safe. No one nearby.\n4. (6,9)/(8,9): 5+ turns. Enemy at (5,9) can get there in 1 turn (if they move RIGHT or UP).\n\n**Conclusion on Strategy:**\nThe apple at (4,4) is the closest and easiest to get. It is safer than (5,8) because the enemy is at (5,9).\nIf I move UP (towards 5,8), the enemy might move DOWN and eat the apple. I would have wasted a turn and moved closer to the enemy.\nIf I move LEFT (towards 4,4), I secure the apple (in 2 turns) and move away from the enemy (who is at x=5, y=9).\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" from the prompt (Turn 10) said:\n> Option 1: LEFT to (4, 4). ... However, this moves me into the path between the enemy snake (at x=4) ... This might be risky if they decide to come down to the middle rows.\n\nThe enemy is at x=5 (head) and x=4,3,2 (body).\nIf I move to x=4, I am at the same x as the enemy's body (which is high up at y=9).\nThe enemy is at y=9. I am at y=5.\nThe \"risk\" of them coming down is low because they are far.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" prioritized UP to \"keep options open\".\nBut moving LEFT opens the path to (4,4) and (0,5) and (3,5) and (4,6).\nMoving UP opens the path to (5,6), (4,5), (6,5).\nActually, let's check the \"Last Move\" info again.\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\nSo the previous move was UP.\nWait, the prompt says:\n**My Snake:**\n- Head: (5, 5)\n- Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)]\nIf the previous move was UP, that means the head moved from (5, 4) to (5, 5).\nSo the body was previously [(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)] (or similar).\nThis matches the body list given.\n\nOkay, so why did the previous AI choose UP?\n\"Moving UP to (5, 5) is the safest play to maintain space against the enemy snake at the top.\"\n\"Priority safety and positioning over immediate apple.\"\n\nLet's look at the current board state again.\nRow 9: `. . T T T 0 A . A .`\nThe enemy is at (5,9).\nDirectly to the right of the enemy is an apple at (6,9).\nDirectly to the right of that is (7,9) empty.\nThen (8,9) is an apple.\nSo the enemy has two apples at the top right.\nIf I go to (4,4), I am going bottom left.\nIf I go to (5,6), I am going towards the center.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nIf I move DOWN (5,4), I die (hit body).\nIf I move UP (5,6), safe.\nIf I move LEFT (4,5), safe.\nIf I move RIGHT (6,5), safe.\n\nIs there a threat from the enemy this turn?\nEnemy head: (5,9).\nPossible enemy moves:\n- UP: (5,10) (Off board) -> Dies.\n- DOWN: (5,8) (Apple). Likely move.\n- LEFT: (4,9) (Body). Dies.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) (Apple). Likely move.\n\nSo the enemy will likely move DOWN or RIGHT.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5,8):\n- I am at (5,5).\n- If I move UP to (5,6), distance is 2. If I move UP again, distance is 1. If I move UP again, I'm at (5,8).\n- If I move LEFT to (4,5), I am at x=4, y=5.\n- The enemy is at x=5, y=8.\n- I am not in immediate danger.\n\n**Why the change from \"Last Rationale\"?**\nThe \"Last Rationale\" chose UP to stay safe.\nHowever, I see an opportunity at (4,4).\n(4,4) is an apple.\nDistance to (4,4) from (5,5) is 2 moves (Left then Down).\nI am currently at (5,5).\nMoving LEFT puts me at (4,5).\nFrom (4,5), I can move DOWN to (4,4) and eat the apple.\nWhile the previous AI avoided this, it seems like the most logical *strategic* play to gain points.\nWhy? Because it's a guaranteed point in 2 turns (assuming I survive), and it moves me away from the contested area at the top right (where the enemy is).\nThe enemy is fighting for (6,9) and (5,8).\nLetting them fight for those while I take the easy apple at (4,4) seems smart.\n\nLet's double check if (4,4) is safe.\nFrom (5,5) -> (4,5).\nNext turn: (4,5) -> (4,4).\nIs (4,4) occupied?\nCurrent board: Row 4 has `A` at (4,4).\nSo it will be an apple.\nIs there a body there? No.\nIs there an enemy head there? No (Enemy is at y=9).\n\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN to (5,8) and I move LEFT to (4,5)?\nNext turn (Turn 12):\n- Me: (4,5) -> (4,4) (Eat apple).\n- Enemy: (5,8).\nDistance is safe.\n\nWhat if I move UP to (5,6) and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,8)?\nNext turn (Turn 12):\n- Me: (5,6).\n- Enemy: (5,8).\nDistance 2.\nIf I move UP again (Turn 13): (5,7).\nEnemy moves DOWN (Turn 13): (5,9)? No, they are at (5,8). They can't go back to (5,9). They might go DOWN to (5,7). Collision.\nOr Right to (6,8).\nIf they go DOWN, we collide.\nIf I stay on x=5, I am racing them for the apple at (5,8) (if they don't eat it immediately on Turn 11).\nWait, if Enemy moves DOWN to (5,8), they eat the apple at (5,8) *this turn*.\nSo if I go UP, I lose the apple at (5,8) immediately.\nIf I go LEFT, I get the apple at (4,4) in 2 turns.\n\nThere is no scenario where I get (5,8) unless the enemy chooses not to take it (e.g. goes RIGHT to (6,9)). But (6,9) is also an apple.\nThe enemy is at (5,9). (6,9) is Right. (5,8) is Down.\nBoth are apples.\nThe enemy has 4 apples. I have 3. I need to catch up.\nTaking the guaranteed apple at (4,4) is better than fighting over (5,8) with an enemy who is right next to it.\n\nTherefore, I will move LEFT.\n\nWait, the prompt asks for a \"Strategy Note\" for the next turn's rationale.\nI should probably include that I am going for the apple at (4,4).\n\"Move LEFT to approach the apple at (4,4). The enemy is busy with the top-right apples.\"\n\nLet's check for hidden dangers.\nBoard state:\nRow 4: `. . . . A T . . . .`\n`A` at (4,4).\n`T` at (5,4).\nI am at (5,5).\nMy body: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)].\nSo (5,4) is my body.\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), my new body will be:\nHead: (4,5)\nBody: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\nWait, (5,5) was my head, now it's a body segment.\n(5,4) was a body segment.\nSo the body segments are (5,5), (5,4), (5,3).\nThis matches the `T` at (5,4) and the `T` at (5,3) (if the board was updated).\n\nIs there any move that kills me?\n- LEFT to (4,5): Empty. Safe.\n- UP to (5,6): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,5): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,4): Body. Kill.\n\nI need to choose between LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\nLEFT gets me to (4,5), which is one step closer to (4,4).\nUP gets me to (5,6), which is one step closer to (5,8) (but enemy takes it).\nRIGHT gets me to (6,5), which is one step closer to (6,9) (but enemy takes it).\n\nOkay, I am confident in LEFT.\n\nStrategy Note for next turn:\n\"Targeting the apple at (4,4). Moving LEFT to approach it. Avoiding the contested apples at the top right where the enemy is located.\"\n\nOne more check: The \"Last Rationale\" mentioned \"Enemy Snake #0 - Head: (5, 9), Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\".\nWait, the prompt says Enemy Head is (5,9).\nThe Body is [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8)].\nSo the body at (4,9) is directly left of the head.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, they hit their body. So they cannot move LEFT.\nIf they move UP, off board.\nIf they move DOWN, (5,8) (Apple).\nIf they move RIGHT, (6,9) (Apple).\n\nSo the enemy will definitely move DOWN or RIGHT.\nNeither of these moves brings them towards me (at 5,5) immediately.\nMoving LEFT to (4,5) is safe from the enemy this turn.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\nBottom left is (0,0). Top right (9,9).\nY increases UP. X increases RIGHT.\nMy head: (5,5).\nLEFT: (4,5). Correct.\nUP: (5,6). Correct.\n\nI will output LEFT.\n\nDouble check if I should output UP instead?\nWhy did the previous turn choose UP?\n\"To maintain space... keeps me central.\"\nCentral is good, but I am losing points.\nI am behind 3 to 4.\nI need to eat apples.\nThe apple at (4,4) is an easy point.\nThe apple at (5,8) is contested.\nThe apple at (6,9) is contested.\nThe apple at (8,9) is contested.\nThe apple at (0,5) is far.\n\nI should take (4,4).\nMove LEFT.\n\nOne specific detail: The \"Last Move\" was UP. So I am at (5,5).\nIf I move DOWN, I hit my tail (5,4).\nSo DOWN is out.\nLEFT is (4,5). Is (4,5) occupied?\nBoard state Row 5: `A . . . . 1 . . . .`\nIndices: 0=A, 1=., 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=1.\nSo (4,5) is index 4, which is '.'. Empty.\nSafe.\n\nI will write the reasoning in the \"Strategy Note\" part of the response.\nThe final line must be \"LEFT\".\n\nWait, the prompt says:\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should write:\n[Strategy Note]\n[Final Move]\n\nThe strategy note should explain why I am moving LEFT.\n\n\"Moving LEFT to approach the apple at (4,4). This is a safer target than the apples at the top right currently guarded by Snake #0. Avoiding the vertical line x=5 where the enemy head is located.\"\n\nThis seems solid.\n\nOne final check: The prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis confirms my understanding of UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nStrategy Note:\nI am at (5,5). Enemy snake #0 is at (5,9) guarding apples (5,8) and (6,9). The apple at (4,4) is unguarded and closer (distance 2). Moving LEFT approaches the apple at (4,4) and moves me away from the enemy's current position. This secures a point while maintaining safety.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nWait, I should not say \"Move: LEFT\". I should just write \"LEFT\".\n\nLet's write the response.\nInclude the strategy note first.\nThen the move.\n\nStrategy Note:\n\"Targeting the apple at (4,4) by moving LEFT. The enemy is occupied with the apples at the top right (x=5-6, y=9). Moving to x=4 avoids direct confrontation and secures an easy point.\"\n\nMove:\nLEFT\n\nWait, I should check the rule about \"If all snakes die...\". Does not apply here.\n\"If you move onto an apple...\". (4,5) is not an apple. (0,5) is apple. (4,4) is apple. (5,8) is apple. (6,9) is apple. (8,9) is apple.\nSo (4,5) is empty.\nCorrect.\n\nWhat about the enemy moving DOWN to (5,8) and eating the apple?\nIf the enemy eats (5,8), they grow.\nIf the enemy eats (6,9), they grow.\nI am at (5,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (4,5), I am ready to eat (4,4) next turn.\nThis seems like the best play.\n\nThe previous rationale said \"Option 1: LEFT to (4, 4). ... This moves me into the path between the enemy snake (at x=4) ... This might be risky if they decide to come down\".\nThe enemy is at x=5. The body is at x=4.\nI am moving to x=4.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, they are at (5,8). They are at x=5.\nSo I am not in their path.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, they are at (6,9).\nI am safe.\n\nI will stick with LEFT.\n\nFinal output format:\n[Strategy Note]\n[Move]\n\nStrategy Note: \"Approaching the apple at (4,4) by moving LEFT. This is safer than moving towards the contested apples at the top right where Snake #0 is located.\"\nMove: LEFT\n\nWait, the \"Strategy Note\" is usually just the text, no label. The prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale\".\nSo just the text.\n\n\"Targeting the apple at (4,4). Moving LEFT to secure the point while avoiding the enemy at (5,9).\"\n\nThen \"LEFT\".\n\nOne small thing: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nIf I move LEFT to (4,5), I do NOT grow. The apple is at (4,4).\nSo the tail will move (I don't grow), effectively shortening the body (unless I turn).\nWait, if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward.\nCurrent body length is 3 (head + 3 body parts).\nIf I move LEFT (no apple), the new body is:\nHead (4,5).\nBody (5,5), (5,4), (5,3).\nThe tail (5,2) is gone.\nLength remains 4 (1 head + 3 body).\nCorrect.\n\nIf I were to move DOWN (illegal).\nIf I move UP (no apple).\nIf I move RIGHT (no apple).\n\nOkay, logic holds.\n\nOne more check on the \"Last Rationale\".\nIt chose UP.\nWhy?\n\"It keeps me central and less likely to be immediately blocked by the enemy descending from y=9.\"\nBut I am moving to (4,5). The enemy is at (5,9).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (5,8), they are at (5,8).\nI am at (4,5).\nI am not blocked.\nI have plenty of space: (4,4), (3,5), (4,6), etc.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" was overly cautious.\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nThe apple at (4,4) is a critical asset. Taking it puts me at 4 apples, tying with the enemy (who has 4). This is a good milestone.\n\nThe prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nSo if I move LEFT to (4,5), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,8), we don't collide.\nDistance is large.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nStrategy note:\n\"To secure the apple at (4,4), I am moving LEFT. This avoids the enemy snake at (5,9) who is likely to move DOWN or RIGHT to eat the apples at the top right.\"\n\nMove:\nLEFT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it\" for the final line.\nThe final line must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nSo I must ensure the strategy note does not end with a direction, and the final line is just \"LEFT\".\n\nStrategy note text: \"Moving LEFT to get closer to the apple at (4,4) and avoid the enemy snake at (5,9).\"\nFinal line: LEFT\n\nThis looks correct.Moving LEFT to approach the apple at (4, 4). This avoids the enemy snake currently at the top right (5, 9) who is likely to move towards the apples at (5, 8) or (6, 9). Securing the apple at (4, 4) will help me catch up in score.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. I'm snake #1 with head at (3,5), body segments at (4,5), (5,5), and (5,4). I've collected 3 apples. The enemy snake #0 has head at (7,9) and a long body stretching left to (2,9). Apples are at (8,9), (0,5), (4,4), (5,8), and (8,1).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, moving from (4,5) to (3,5). That makes sense as I was heading toward the apple at (4,4). But now I need to decide my next move.\n\nLet me list all possible moves and evaluate them:\n\n1. **UP**: From (3,5) to (3,6). Check if this is safe:\n   - Is (3,6) on the board? Yes, y=6 is within 0-9.\n   - Is (3,6) part of my body? My body segments are at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). (3,6) is not in this list.\n   - Is (3,6) part of enemy snake #0's body? Enemy body: (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9). All have y=9, so no.\n   - However, I need to consider that snakes move simultaneously. Enemy snake #0's head is at (7,9). It could move in various directions, but it might not move into (3,6).\n   - Also, I should avoid moving directly backwards into my own body. My current head is at (3,5), and my tail is at (5,4). The segment behind my head would be (4,5), but I'm moving UP to (3,6), which is not backwards. Backwards would be if I moved RIGHT to (4,5), but that's into my own body segment. So UP is safe from self-collision.\n   - But let's check if any other snake might move into (3,6). Enemy snake #0 is far away at top. Their possible moves: from (7,9), they can go UP (off board, die), DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), or RIGHT to (8,9). (6,9) is already occupied by their body? No, (6,9) is their body segment? Wait, their body list: [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9)] \u2013 so (6,9) is the first body segment, meaning head is at (7,9), body starts at (6,9). So if they move LEFT to (6,9), that's into their own body, so they would die. Similarly, UP is off board, DOWN to (7,8) which is empty, RIGHT to (8,9) which is an apple. So they might move to (7,8) or (8,9). Neither is (3,6). So UP seems safe.\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (3,5) to (3,4). Check safety:\n   - On board? y=4 is within 0-9.\n   - My body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). (3,4) is not in my body.\n   - Enemy body: all y=9, so no.\n   - Backwards? No, moving DOWN to (3,4) is not backwards; backwards would be RIGHT to (4,5).\n   - But I need to see if (3,4) is empty. From the board state: at y=4, row 4: \". . . . A T . . . .\" so at x=3, it's \".\" meaning empty. Yes.\n   - Also, enemy snake #0 won't move to (3,4) because they are at y=9.\n   - So DOWN seems safe.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (3,5) to (2,5). Check safety:\n   - On board? x=2 is within 0-9.\n   - My body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). (2,5) is not in my body.\n   - Enemy body: all y=9, so no.\n   - Backwards? No, LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5) is not backwards; backwards would be RIGHT.\n   - From board state: at y=5, row 5: \"A . . 1 T T . . . .\" so at x=2, it's \".\"? Let's see: row 5: positions: x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: 1 (my head), x=4: T (my body?), wait, from my body: head at (3,5), body at (4,5), (5,5), so at x=4,y=5 and x=5,y=5 are my body segments, so in the board, at row 5, x=4 is T for tail? But in the body list, (4,5) is the first body segment after head, so it should be part of my body. In the board representation, \"1\" is head, \"T\" is body? But in the enemy snake, \"0\" is head, \"T\" for their body? Let's see the board: for snake #0, head is (7,9), body at (6,9) etc., and in row 9, it shows \"0\" at x=7 and \"T\" for x=6,5,4,3,2? Yes, from the board: \"9 . . T T T T T 0 A .\" so at x=2 to x=6 are \"T\" for body, x=7 is \"0\" for head. Similarly, for me, at row 5, \"5 A . . 1 T T . . . .\" so at x=3 is \"1\" (head), x=4 is \"T\" (body), x=5 is \"T\" (body). So at x=2, it's \".\", so empty. So LEFT to (2,5) is empty.\n   - So LEFT seems safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (3,5) to (4,5). Check safety:\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - But (4,5) is part of my body! From my body list: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], so (4,5) is the first body segment. If I move RIGHT into (4,5), that's moving into my own body, which is immediate death. So this move is not safe.\n\nSo, immediately, RIGHT is unsafe because it hits my own body. So I eliminate RIGHT.\n\nNow, among UP, DOWN, LEFT, all seem safe from immediate collision. But I need to consider future moves and apple collection.\n\nApples I can see: \n- (4,4) is very close. I'm at (3,5), so (4,4) is down-right, but I can't move diagonally. To reach (4,4), I need to go DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN, but RIGHT is unsafe right now because it hits my body. If I move DOWN to (3,4), then from there I can go RIGHT to (4,4) which is an apple. Similarly, if I move LEFT to (2,5), then from there I can go DOWN to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,5) but (3,5) is where I am now, so after moving, my tail moves, so it might be safe later. But let's think step by step.\n\nAlso, there are other apples: (0,5), (5,8), (8,9), (8,1). But (4,4) is the closest.\n\nNow, I need to think about the enemy snake. Snake #0 is at (7,9) with body from (6,9) to (2,9). They have 5 apples, I have 3. I need to catch up. They are at the top, and there are apples at (8,9) and (5,8) near them. So they might go for those. But I should focus on my own survival and apple collection.\n\nMy last move rationale was to go LEFT to approach (4,4), but from (4,5) going LEFT to (3,5) gets me closer to (4,4)? Actually, from (4,5), (4,4) is directly DOWN. But I went LEFT to (3,5), which is adjacent to (4,4)? No, (3,5) to (4,4) is diagonally, not directly. So from (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4) and then RIGHT to (4,4), or I can go RIGHT but RIGHT is unsafe now. Alternatively, from (3,5), if I go DOWN to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can go RIGHT to (4,4) and eat the apple.\n\nBut let's see what happens if I move DOWN to (3,4). After moving, my tail will move, so the body segments shift. Currently, body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]. If I move DOWN to (3,4), then the new head is (3,4), and the body becomes: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]? No, the body list is ordered head-to-tail. When I move, the head moves to new position, and each body segment takes the place of the previous one, and the tail is removed unless I eat an apple. So if I don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward.\n\nSo if I move DOWN to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- New body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) \u2014 so the last segment (5,4) is removed because we didn't eat an apple.\n- Then from (3,4), I can go RIGHT to (4,4) which is an apple, so I would eat it and grow.\n\nBut in this move, I'm moving to (3,4), which is empty, so no immediate issue.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,6):\n- New head: (3,6)\n- New body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n- From there, I might go towards other apples, but (3,6) is not near any apple immediately. Apples are at (4,4), (0,5), etc. From (3,6), I can go DOWN to (3,5) but that's my old body, but after moving, (3,5) is now part of my body? Let's see: after moving UP, body includes (3,5), so if I go DOWN back to (3,5), that would be into my own body, which is bad. So from (3,6), moving DOWN might be dangerous if my body is there. Similarly, I can go LEFT to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6), etc. But no apples nearby except perhaps (5,8) which is far.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,5):\n- New head: (2,5)\n- New body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n- From (2,5), I can go DOWN to (2,4) or UP to (2,6), etc. But apples: (0,5) is to the left, but I need to go LEFT twice to reach (0,5), but from (2,5) to (0,5) is LEFT twice, but first move to (1,5), then to (0,5). But I need to see if that path is clear. From board, row 5: at x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: ., so from (2,5), I can go LEFT to (1,5) which is empty, then LEFT to (0,5) which is apple. But I have to consider the enemy and my own body.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake #0. They are at (7,9). They might move towards apples at (8,9) or (5,8). (8,9) is adjacent to (7,9) so they might go RIGHT to (8,9) and eat that apple. Or they might go DOWN to (7,8) to approach (5,8). But since they have 5 apples, they might be aggressive. However, I need to focus on my own moves.\n\nI also need to think about avoiding future traps. My current position is at (3,5), and I have body segments at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). So if I move DOWN to (3,4), then my body will be at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Then from (3,4), I can go RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple. But after eating, I grow, so my body becomes longer. That might be good for scoring but could make me more vulnerable to trapping.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (2,5), then from there I can go DOWN to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,5) towards (0,5). But (0,5) is an apple, so that might be a good path.\n\nBut let's see which apple is most reachable. (4,4) is very close: from (3,5), if I go DOWN to (3,4), then RIGHT to (4,4), so two moves away. Similarly, (0,5) is from (3,5), if I go LEFT to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5), then LEFT to (0,5), so three moves away. But after moving LEFT once, I'm at (2,5), then from there, I can go LEFT to (1,5) and then to (0,5), but I need to ensure that after each move, I don't hit myself or enemy.\n\nAlso, there is apple at (5,8), but that's up from my current position. From (3,5), I need to go UP to (3,6), (3,7), etc., but that might be far and not immediate.\n\nSimilarly, (8,1) and (8,9) are far.\n\nSo, (4,4) seems the most immediate apple to target.\n\nNow, for my next move, I need to choose between UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,4), I can then go RIGHT to (4,4) and eat the apple. But is (3,4) safe? From board, at row 4: \". . . . A T . . . .\" so at x=3, it's \".\", empty. Also, no enemy there. But I need to consider that when I move DOWN, the enemy might move in a way that affects me? But since snakes move simultaneously, and enemy is far, it's unlikely that enemy moves to (3,4) this turn. But after I move to (3,4), my body will be at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Then if I move RIGHT to (4,4), that should be safe because (4,4) is an apple, and my body won't be there yet? But after moving DOWN to (3,4), my body includes (3,5), so if I then move RIGHT to (4,4), I'm moving to a cell that is currently empty but will be occupied? No, when I move, all moves happen simultaneously, so when I decide to move RIGHT from (3,4) to (4,4), at that turn, the board state is based on previous positions. So for the move from (3,4) to (4,4), I need to check if (4,4) is safe at that moment.\n\nBut for now, I only need to decide this turn's move.\n\nSo for this turn, from (3,5), I consider moves:\n\n- UP to (3,6): safe, but not towards any immediate apple.\n- DOWN to (3,4): safe, and moves me towards (4,4) apple.\n- LEFT to (2,5): safe, and moves me towards (0,5) apple, but slower.\n\nAlso, I should consider if moving DOWN might put me in a position where I have fewer options later. For example, if I go to (3,4), then from there, I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? But UP to (3,5) is my old body, but after moving, (3,5) is part of my body, so going UP back to (3,5) would be into my own body, which is deadly. So from (3,4), I cannot go UP. So that reduces my options. Similarly, if I go LEFT to (2,5), from there I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), RIGHT to (3,5) but (3,5) is my old body, so after moving to (2,5), my body includes (3,5), so going RIGHT to (3,5) would be into my own body, so I cannot go RIGHT from (2,5). So from (2,5), I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6), I can go UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5) which is my body, so cannot go DOWN, LEFT to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6). So from (3,6), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nSo, all moves have some limitations, but that's normal.\n\nNow, to decide which move is better, I think moving towards an apple is key. Since (4,4) is closest, I should go for it. So moving DOWN to (3,4) sets me up to eat (4,4) next turn.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving DOWN is safe this turn. As above, yes.\n\nWhat about LEFT? Moving LEFT to (2,5) also sets me up for (0,5), but that apple is farther, and I might have to compete with enemy? But enemy is at top, so probably not. But (0,5) is at left bottom, and enemy is at top right, so no conflict.\n\nBut since I have only 150 turns and I'm at turn 13, I need to collect apples efficiently. (4,4) is just one move away after this move, whereas (0,5) is two moves away after this move. So (4,4) is faster.\n\nAlso, there might be other apples that appear, but based on current apples, (4,4) is the nearest.\n\nNow, I should also consider the enemy's possible moves. Snake #0 at (7,9). They have apples at (8,9) and (5,8). They might go for (8,9) since it's adjacent. If they go RIGHT to (8,9), they eat an apple and grow. But that doesn't directly affect me. However, if they grow, they might block paths later, but for now, they are far away.\n\nAnother thing: in my last move, I moved LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5). Now, if I move DOWN to (3,4), that seems consistent with approaching (4,4).\n\nBut let's see if there is any risk of head-on collision. Since enemy is far, it's unlikely that they move to the same cell as me. So I think DOWN is safe.\n\nWhat about UP? If I go UP to (3,6), then I might be moving away from apples, so not optimal.\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (2,5) is towards (0,5), but (0,5) is farther, so I should prioritize closer apples.\n\nTherefore, I think DOWN is the best move.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the board for any hidden dangers. At (3,4), is there anything? From board, row 4: at x=3, it's \". \" so empty. Also, no other snakes there.\n\nAlso, after moving DOWN, my body will be at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So if I then move RIGHT to (4,4), I need to ensure that (4,4) is not occupied by anything else. From board, (4,4) is an apple, so it should be empty except for the apple itself. And apples don't block movement; moving onto an apple means you eat it and grow.\n\nSo, yes, moving DOWN this turn and then RIGHT next turn should allow me to eat the apple at (4,4).\n\nIf I move LEFT this turn, then I need to move LEFT again to (1,5) and then to (0,5), which takes two more moves after this one, whereas with DOWN, I can eat the apple in two moves total (this move DOWN and next move RIGHT).\n\nSo DOWN is better.\n\nNow, is there any reason to avoid DOWN? For example, if moving DOWN puts me in a corner or something? From (3,4), I can go LEFT to (2,4) or DOWN to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,4) after eating, but since I plan to eat immediately, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, from (3,4), if I don't eat immediately, I could go DOWN to (3,3) but no apple there, so not beneficial.\n\nSo, I think DOWN is the move.\n\nBut let's consider the current turn and future turns. The game has 150 turns, and I'm at turn 13, so plenty of time. But I need to catch up in apples: enemy has 5, I have 3. So I need to eat apples efficiently.\n\nAnother apple is at (5,8), which is up from my position. From (3,5), if I go UP to (3,6), then UP to (3,7), then RIGHT to (4,7), then UP to (4,8), but (5,8) is at x=5,y=8. From (4,8), I can go RIGHT to (5,8). But that's many moves, and I might not have direct path. Also, from (3,5), going UP to (3,6) might be safe, but let's see the board: at row 6, it's all empty? From board, row 6: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so yes, empty. But no apples there. So going UP doesn't immediately help.\n\nSimilarly, going LEFT to (2,5) and then to (1,5) and (0,5) for the apple at (0,5). That apple is at (0,5), which is leftmost. From (2,5), to (0,5) is two moves left, but after moving LEFT this turn, I'm at (2,5), then next turn I can go LEFT to (1,5), then next turn to (0,5). So three moves from now? From current position (3,5), if I go LEFT this turn to (2,5), then from there, I can go LEFT to (1,5) next turn, and then LEFT to (0,5) on the turn after, so after three moves I eat the apple. Whereas if I go DOWN this turn to (3,4), then RIGHT next turn to (4,4), so I eat the apple in two moves from now. So DOWN is faster.\n\nTherefore, I should go DOWN.\n\nBut wait, is there any risk with the enemy? For example, if the enemy moves down and might intersect with me? But enemy is at y=9, and I'm at y=5, so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, I should consider if I can eat multiple apples in a sequence. After eating (4,4), I might go for another apple. But for now, just next move.\n\nSo, I think the decision is to move DOWN.\n\nBut let's confirm all moves are safe as per rules.\n\nFor DOWN to (3,4):\n- On board? Yes.\n- Not into my body? My body is at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). (3,4) is not in that list.\n- Not into enemy body? Enemy body all at y=9, so no.\n- Not moving directly backwards? Backwards would be if I moved towards my tail, but from (3,5), my tail is at (5,4), so backwards would be towards (4,5) or (5,5)? Actually, moving directly backwards means moving into the cell that was just behind my head. Before moving, my head is at (3,5), and the segment behind it is (4,5). So moving directly backwards would be moving RIGHT to (4,5). But I'm moving DOWN to (3,4), which is not backwards. So safe.\n\nThus, DOWN is safe.\n\nNow, for UP to (3,6):\n- Safe, but not towards apple.\n\nFor LEFT to (2,5):\n- Safe, but farther from immediate apple.\n\nSo, I'll go with DOWN.\n\nBut in the last move rationale, I was moving LEFT to approach (4,4)? That seems inconsistent because from (4,5), moving LEFT to (3,5) doesn't directly approach (4,4); it approaches it only if I then move DOWN. But from (3,5), I can move DOWN to (3,4) which is closer to (4,4). So perhaps my last move was suboptimal, but now I can correct it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (4,5), I should have moved DOWN directly to (4,4) to eat the apple? But in my last move, I moved LEFT to (3,5), which might have been to avoid something? But from the last move info, I moved LEFT to approach (4,4), which is odd because moving LEFT from (4,5) takes me away from (4,4). Unless I planned to go LEFT then DOWN then RIGHT? But that seems inefficient. Anyway, I have to work with current position.\n\nSo, for this turn, I choose DOWN.\n\nFinally, I need to output only one word: DOWN.\n\nBut before that, I should think about long-term plan. The instruction says I may write a short long-term plan or strategy note for the next turn. But since the next turn will be shown back, I can include a brief plan.\n\nIn the last move, I had a rationale, so I should have one for this move too.\n\nSo, for my response, I should think out loud and explain reasoning, then include a plan, and then the final move.\n\nThe instruction says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next turn. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo, I need to have my reasoning and plan, and then the final move on the last line.\n\nSo, let me structure my response.\n\nFirst, reasoning: I need to explain why I chose DOWN.\n\nThen, a plan for future turns: for example, after moving DOWN to (3,4), I plan to move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,4), then perhaps go for another apple.\n\nBut since I don't know what will happen, I can say: \"Plan: After moving DOWN to (3,4), next move RIGHT to eat apple at (4,4). Then assess board for next apple, likely towards (0,5) or (5,8).\"\n\nBut keep it short.\n\nFinally, the word DOWN.\n\nSo, now, let's write the responseAfter evaluating all possible moves from my current position at (3,5), I eliminate RIGHT because it would move me directly into my own body at (4,5), resulting in immediate death. Among the remaining safe moves\u2014UP, DOWN, and LEFT\u2014I consider which move best positions me to collect an apple while maintaining safety and future flexibility.\n\n- **UP to (3,6)**: This move is safe but moves me away from all visible apples. It limits my options because from (3,6), I cannot move DOWN (back into my body) and there are no apples nearby, making it inefficient for scoring.\n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: This move is safe and moves me toward the apple at (0,5), but it is farther away. To reach (0,5), I would need two additional moves left, which takes longer and may expose me to risks if the enemy snake moves unpredictably.\n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: This move is safe and directly sets me up to eat the apple at (4,4) next turn by moving to (3,4), from which I can go RIGHT to (4,4) and grow. This is the most efficient path to collect an apple quickly, helping me catch up to the enemy's score.\n\nI also consider the enemy snake's position, but it is far away at the top of the board, so no immediate collision risk. Moving DOWN keeps my options open for future moves, as from (3,4) I can still access multiple directions (LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT after eating the apple) to pursue other apples like (0,5) or (5,8).\n\nPlan: After moving DOWN to (3,4), next turn move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,4). Then, assess the board for the next closest apple, likely targeting (0,5) or (5,8), while avoiding the enemy snake's path.\n\nDOWN",

This snake is far away on the right side of the board and does not pose an immediate threat.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** (4, 4).\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   **Boundary:** (4, 4) is within the 10x10 board (0-9).\n        *   **My Body:** The target (4, 4) is not in the current body list `[(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]`.\n            *   *Check for immediate backward move:* The cell directly behind my head (at (4, 3)) is (3, 3). (4, 4) is not (3, 3).\n        *   **Enemy Body:** The target (4, 4) is not in Snake #0's body `[(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)]`.\n    *   **Score/Growth:** (4, 4) contains an apple ('A'). Moving here will collect the apple, increase my length by 1, and increase my score.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE and REWARDING.**\n\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** (5, 3).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe (not occupied, within bounds, not backwards).\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves horizontally but does not collect an apple. It positions for an apple at (5, 8) but is further from the immediate apple at (4, 4).\n\n3.  **LEFT (3, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** (3, 3).\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 3) is the current head position, but the body is shifting. However, (3, 3) is the cell directly behind my current head (since my body starts at (3, 3)). Moving into the cell immediately occupied by your own body is a collision.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY.**\n\n4.  **DOWN (4, 2):**\n    *   **Target:** (4, 2).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves away from the apple at (4, 4).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move UP is the only one that allows me to eat an apple this turn. It is confirmed safe by checking boundaries, my body (ensuring it is not the immediate backward cell), and the enemy body. Moving to collect the apple at (4, 4) maximizes points and maintains position near the center of the board.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (4, 4) to eat the apple. After this move, the body will grow, and the new head position will be (4, 4). I will need to plan the next move to avoid the new tail (which will be at (3, 3) or similar) and head towards the next closest apple, likely (0, 5) or (5, 8), while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nUP",

A . . 0 T`\n        `A` is at x=5. So (5,8) is an apple.\n        \n    *   **Let's double check (0,5).**\n        Row 5: `A . . T ...`\n        Yes, (0,5) is an apple.\n        \n    *   **Enemy movement prediction:**\n        Enemy at (8,8). Body along y=9 (mostly). Head at (8,8).\n        Possible moves: (9,8) is blocked (body). (7,8) is empty? Row 8: ` . . . . . A . . 0 T`\n        (7,8) is `.`.\n        (8,9) is body.\n        (8,7) is empty? Row 7: ` . . . . . . . A . .`\n        (8,7) is `.`.\n        So enemy can go Left (7,8) or Down (8,7).\n        If it goes Left, it stays away from me.\n        If it goes Down, it goes towards (8,1) and (7,7).\n        I am going UP/Left. I am safe.\n        \n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        UP is the best move. It opens paths to the closest apples and avoids the enemy.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTurn 17: Move UP to (4, 5). This maintains safety and allows access to apples at (0, 5) and (5, 8). On the next turn, evaluate moving UP again towards (5, 8) or turning LEFT towards (0, 5) depending on the new board state. Keep distance from the enemy snake on the right.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

I would die.\n\n**DOWN to (7,7):** This is an empty cell. This would be a safe move\u2014and it lands directly on the apple at (7,7), so I would grow and gain a point.\n\n**LEFT to (6,8):** This is an empty cell. This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,8):** This is my own body! I would die.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake is at (4,5) with body at (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). They are likely to move:\n- UP to (4,6) \u2014 empty, away from apples.\n- DOWN to (4,4) \u2014 but this is their own body, so they can't.\n- LEFT to (3,5) \u2014 empty, but they would be moving toward the center.\n- RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 empty.\n\nThe enemy snake is far enough away that none of my safe moves risk a head-on collision with them this turn. Their head is not in a position to threaten my next move, and I\u2019m not moving into a cell they could occupy.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. Moving UP to (7,9) is deadly (into my own body).\n2. Moving RIGHT to (8,8) is deadly (into my own body).\n3. Moving DOWN to (7,7) is safe **and** lands on an apple\u2014this is the optimal move.\n4. Moving LEFT to (6,8) is safe but doesn\u2019t gain an apple and may reduce future options.\n\n**Best move:**\nDOWN to (7,7) is not only safe but also yields an immediate apple, increasing my apple count to 7 and giving me a growth segment. This improves my lead over the enemy snake and keeps me in a strong position.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,7), my new head will be at (7,7) and I\u2019ll grow, so my new tail will remain at (5,9) for one more turn. I should then aim for the next closest apple\u2014likely (5,8) or (0,5)\u2014while continuing to avoid the enemy. The enemy is still far and not directly threatening, but I should keep an eye on their possible moves toward the center. I will prioritize apples that keep me mobile and away from tight spaces.\n\nDOWN",

Body follows: (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4). I am safe.\n    *   **Apples:** There is an apple at (0, 5) which is on the same Y-level as my head (y=5) but to the left. There is also an apple at (5, 8) above and slightly right. Others are further.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (7, 8). Body fills (8, 8) to (6, 9). It is on the right side of the board.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves for Turn 18:**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 5):** Target cell (3, 5).\n        *   **Safety Check:** The body list provided in the prompt ends with `(3, 5)` as the tail. Moving into the tail is generally safe *unless* the snake grows this turn. However, I am not currently on an apple, so I will not grow. The tail will move forward, vacating (3, 5) just as I arrive. Thus, this move is **Safe**.\n    *   **UP (4, 6):** Target cell (4, 6).\n        *   **Safety Check:** This is empty space. **Safe**.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 4):** Target cell (4, 4).\n        *   **Safety Check:** This is the cell currently occupied by my second body segment. This is a collision into my own body. **Deadly**.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Target cell (5, 5).\n        *   **Safety Check:** Empty space. **Safe**.\n\n3.  **Strategy and Decision:**\n    *   I must avoid **DOWN** (death) and prefer **LEFT**, **UP**, or **RIGHT**.\n    *   **Goal:** Eat apples to reach 50 or survive.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** The apple at **(0, 5)** is exactly 4 units to the left of my current head (4, 5). Moving **LEFT** takes me directly towards this apple.\n    *   **Enemy Avoidance:** Enemy #0 is at (7, 8). Moving **RIGHT** brings me closer to the enemy territory. Moving **LEFT** or **UP** moves me away from the enemy.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **LEFT:** Moves directly towards the closest apple (0, 5) and moves away from the enemy. It also utilizes the \"safe through tail movement\" mechanic which is efficient.\n        *   **UP:** Moves towards (5, 8), which is further away than (0, 5). It stays roughly in the center/right.\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves away from (0, 5) and towards the enemy.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** **LEFT** is the best move. It is safe (eating my tail which will move), targets the nearest apple directly, and moves away from the enemy.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT towards the apple at (0, 5). Once collected, turn UP to head towards the cluster of apples at (5, 8) and (7, 7), while keeping an eye on Enemy #0's position on the right.\n\nLEFT",

Body wraps around the top-right corner.\n    *   Status: Far away, no immediate collision threat.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (3, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 4):** Safe. The cell (3, 4) was occupied by my tail in the previous state (which was at (3, 4) before moving to (3, 3)? No, previous body was [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. Wait, looking at the previous turn's board state, my tail was at (3, 3). The prompt lists my body as [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The \"Last Move Information\" says I moved LEFT to (3, 5). My body should be [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)] (and the old tail (3, 3) is gone because I didn't eat). So (3, 4) is empty. **Safe**.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 5):** Unsafe. This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment behind my head). **DEADLY**.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am hunting the apple at (0, 5). I need to continue moving Left. I have 3 apples to go until I hit the wall at x=0. I should also look out for the apple at (0, 1) below, but (0, 5) is closer.\nMoving **LEFT** is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (0, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT towards the apple at (0, 5). Once collected, evaluate moving DOWN towards the apple at (0, 1) or turning UP towards the apple at (5, 8), depending on Enemy #0's movement.\n\nLEFT",

This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,7):** This is an empty cell. This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). They are likely to move:\n- UP to (3,6) \u2014 empty, but not near any apple.\n- DOWN to (3,4) \u2014 but this is empty, and they would be moving away from the apple at (0,5).\n- LEFT to (2,5) \u2014 empty, but not near any apple.\n- RIGHT to (4,5) \u2014 but this is their own body, so they can't.\n\nThe enemy snake is far enough away that none of my safe moves risk a head-on collision with them this turn. Their head is not in a position to threaten my next move, and I\u2019m not moving into a cell they could occupy.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1.

Moving RIGHT to (8,7) is safe, but no apple there.\n\n**Best move:**\nSince all safe moves are equivalent in terms of immediate apple gain, I should choose the move that keeps me in the best position for future apple collection. The closest apples to me are:\n- (5,8) \u2014 2 moves away (UP, LEFT)\n- (8,1) \u2014 6 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT)\n- (0,1) \u2014 8 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN)\n- (0,5) \u2014 7 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP)\n- (7,2) \u2014 5 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT)\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is the closest and most accessible. To reach it, I need to move UP to (7,8) and then LEFT to (6,8), etc. However, moving UP to (7,8) is deadly because it's my own body.\n\nTherefore, I need to move in a direction that allows me to reposition for the apple at (5,8) without dying. Moving LEFT to (6,7) or RIGHT to (8,7) are both safe, but moving LEFT to (6,7) keeps me closer to the apple at (5,8) and allows me to move UP to (6,8) next turn, then LEFT to (5,8) the turn after.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (6,7), my next move should be UP to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8) to eat the apple. This will increase my apple count and keep me in a strong position. I should continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and avoid any potential head-on collisions.\n\nLEFT",

Body wraps around the top-right corner (7,7) to (8,9).\n    *   Status: No immediate collision threat to my current position.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head at 2,5):**\n1.  **UP (2, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 5):** Unsafe. This is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am hunting the apple at (0, 5). To reach it, I must continue moving Left. Moving to (1, 5) brings me adjacent to the apple, guaranteeing I can eat it on the next turn (Turn 21). This is the most efficient path. Moving Up or Down would delay collecting this apple and potentially allow Enemy #0 to interfere or cut me off if I decide to go for other apples later.\n\nI will continue moving **LEFT**.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nCollect the apple at (0, 5) next turn. Then, turn DOWN to collect the apple at (0, 1), creating a safe path through the left edge of the board.\n\nLEFT",

This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**DOWN to (6,6):** This is an empty cell. This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**LEFT to (5,7):** This is an empty cell. This would be a safe move, but no apple there.\n\n**RIGHT to (7,7):** This is my own body! I would die.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake is at (2,5) with body at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). They are likely to move:\n- UP to (2,6) \u2014 empty, but not near any apple.\n- DOWN to (2,4) \u2014 but this is empty, and they would be moving away from the apple at (0,5).\n- LEFT to (1,5) \u2014 empty, but not near any apple.\n- RIGHT to (3,5) \u2014 but this is their own body, so they can't.\n\nThe enemy snake is far enough away that none of my safe moves risk a head-on collision with them this turn. Their head is not in a position to threaten my next move, and I\u2019m not moving into a cell they could occupy.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is deadly (into my own body).\n2. Moving UP to (6,8) is safe, but no apple there.\n3. Moving DOWN to (6,6) is safe, but no apple there.\n4. Moving LEFT to (5,7) is safe, but no apple there.\n\n**Best move:**\nSince all safe moves are equivalent in terms of immediate apple gain, I should choose the move that keeps me in the best position for future apple collection. The closest apples to me are:\n- (5,8) \u2014 2 moves away (UP, LEFT)\n- (8,1) \u2014 6 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT)\n- (0,1) \u2014 8 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN)\n- (0,5) \u2014 7 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP)\n- (7,2) \u2014 5 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT)\n\nThe apple at (5,8) is the closest and most accessible. To reach it, I need to move UP to (6,8) and then LEFT to (5,8).\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter moving UP to (6,8), my next move should be LEFT to (5,8) to eat the apple. This will increase my apple count and keep me in a strong position. I should continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements and avoid any potential head-on collisions.\n\nUP",
