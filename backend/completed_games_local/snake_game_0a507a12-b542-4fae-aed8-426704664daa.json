Next turn, my body will occupy (9,7) and (8,7). From (9,7), possible moves would be UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), or LEFT to (8,7) \u2013 but LEFT would be into my own new body (the tail hasn\u2019t moved yet), so that would be unsafe. So after eating, I\u2019d have two safe exits: UP and DOWN. That\u2019s acceptable for one turn; I can then maneuver along the right edge or move away.  \n\n**Alternative moves:**  \nMoving UP, DOWN, or LEFT keeps me at length 1 and doesn\u2019t collect the nearest apple. That delays scoring and leaves me vulnerable if the enemy eats an apple first.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I eat (9,7) this turn, next turn I must avoid moving LEFT into my own tail. Prefer UP or DOWN to stay safe and possibly target (9,5) or (4,8) later. Watch enemy #0: it might head toward (4,8) or (2,1). With length 2, I have more resilience against head\u2011on collisions (if we collide, we both die only if our heads meet; if my head hits its body, it dies; if its head hits my body, I die). Still, avoid direct confrontation while short.  \n\n**Final move choice:**  \nRIGHT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3,9)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) (its own body) \u2192 unsafe for enemy  \n\nNone of my safe squares (8,7), (8,5), (7,6) coincide with those, so no direct head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and growth opportunity**  \n- DOWN to (8,5) moves toward apple (9,5) but not directly onto it.  \n- LEFT to (7,6) moves away from most apples but toward center.  \n- UP to (8,7) moves toward apple (0,7) and (0,6) in the long run, but they are far.  \n\nThe closest apple is (9,5) at distance 2 from my head (Manhattan distance: |8-9| + |6-5| = 2). Moving DOWN reduces that distance to 1. Moving LEFT or UP keeps distance 2 or increases it.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move**  \n- UP to (8,7): next turn from (8,7), possible moves: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6) (will be my body after tail moves?), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). My body after this turn: head (8,7), then (8,6), then (9,6) after tail moves? Wait, my current body is [(9,6)] plus head (8,6). After moving, my head goes to new spot, tail moves forward one? Actually, if I don\u2019t eat an apple, my tail (currently at (9,6)?) will move to where? Let\u2019s trace: current snake: head (8,6), body segment at (9,6). That means my tail is at (9,6). After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, body segment moves to old head (8,6), tail disappears from (9,6). So new body will be [(new head), (8,6)]. So if I move UP to (8,7), my body becomes [(8,7), (8,6)]. Then next turn from (8,7), DOWN to (8,6) would be my own body \u2192 unsafe. So from (8,7), safe moves would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That\u2019s three options.  \n- DOWN to (8,5): new body [(8,5), (8,6)]. Next turn from (8,5), UP to (8,6) is my body \u2192 unsafe. So safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Three options.  \n- LEFT to (7,6): new body [(7,6), (8,6)]. Next turn from (7,6), RIGHT to (8,6) is my body \u2192 unsafe. So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Three options.  \n\nAll three safe moves give similar future mobility (3 safe exits next turn).\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term strategy**  \nI have 1 apple, enemy has 1 apple. Early game, growing safely is key. Apple (9,5) is close and reachable in two turns if I move DOWN now and then LEFT? Actually, if I move DOWN to (8,5), next turn I could move RIGHT to (9,5) to eat it, but from (8,5), moving RIGHT to (9,5) might be safe if no enemy moves there. However, enemy is far, so low risk. Alternatively, moving LEFT now keeps me central and allows me to approach apples (0,7) or (2,3) from the left side, which might be less contested.  \n\nGiven the board layout, enemy is on the top left. If I move UP toward (0,7), I might meet enemy competing for that apple. Moving DOWN puts me near the bottom right apple (9,5), which enemy is far from. That seems like a safer apple to claim.  \n\n**Decision**: I\u2019ll move DOWN to get closer to apple (9,5) while maintaining good mobility. This also avoids moving toward enemy territory prematurely.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (8,5), if apple (9,5) is still there and moving RIGHT is safe (check for enemy head collision), take it to grow. If not, consider moving LEFT or DOWN to stay mobile and maybe target (2,3) or (0,6) later.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, (9,6) is currently my tail, but after growth, my tail stays at (8,6)? Let's trace carefully:  \n  Current: head (8,5), body [(8,6)] (tail at (8,6)).  \n  After moving RIGHT and eating: head moves to (9,5). A new segment is added at the tail, so the tail does *not* move. New body: head (9,5), then old head (8,5), then old body (8,6). So my snake becomes: [(9,5), (8,5), (8,6)].  \n  Next turn from (9,5):  \n  - UP to (9,6): currently empty, will be safe unless enemy moves there.  \n  - DOWN to (9,4): empty.  \n  - LEFT to (8,5): contains my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT is off-board (10,5) \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So from (9,5) after eating, I'll have two safe moves (UP, DOWN). That's somewhat restrictive but manageable given the open space on the top and bottom. I can plan to move away from the wall next turn.\n\n**Step 5: Consider alternative safe moves**  \nIf I avoid the apple and move LEFT or DOWN:  \n- LEFT to (7,5): next turn from (7,5), I'll have more options (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe unless enemy interferes). This keeps me central and flexible.  \n- DOWN to (8,4): similar flexibility, but moves me further from apples.  \n\nHowever, passing up an easy, safe apple is suboptimal. Growing now gives me a score lead and longer body, which can be an advantage in blocking the enemy later. The risk of moving to (9,5) is low\u2014no immediate collision danger. The only downside is reduced mobility next turn because I'll be against the right wall with my body behind me. But I can navigate out by moving UP or DOWN.\n\n**Step 6: Long\u2011term plan note for next turn**  \nIf I eat the apple at (9,5), next turn I must move UP or DOWN to avoid the wall and my own body. Prefer UP toward (9,6) if safe, as it moves toward the apple cluster at (0,7)/(0,6) over the long term, though enemy is also in that area. Alternatively, DOWN to (9,4) opens the southern board. I'll need to check enemy positions and possible collisions carefully next turn.\n\n**Decision**: The benefits of growing now outweigh the temporary mobility reduction. I'll move RIGHT to eat the apple at (9,5).\n\nRIGHT",

Possible enemy moves:\n- UP \u2192 (2,8): empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6): empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7): empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7): its own body \u2192 unsafe for enemy.\n\nMy safe squares are (9,6) and (9,4). None coincide with enemy's possible safe moves, so no direct head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\n- UP to (9,6): moves toward the apple cluster at (0,7)/(0,6) in the long term, but is still far. From (9,6) next turn, I'll have options LEFT (8,6) (my own tail? Let's check: after this move, my body will be [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)]? Wait, I need to simulate movement without growth since I'm not eating an apple. Current: head (9,5), body [(8,5), (8,6)]. If I move UP to (9,6) without eating, my tail (8,6) moves off? Actually, in Snake, when you move without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated. So after moving UP: new head (9,6), new body becomes [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)] (head, old head, old body's first segment). The old tail (8,6) is removed. So next turn from (9,6), my body will be at (9,5) and (8,5). Then LEFT to (8,6) would be empty (old tail vacated), so safe. UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5) (my body), LEFT (8,6), RIGHT off-board. So two safe moves (UP, LEFT) from (9,6).\n- DOWN to (9,4): moves away from most apples but opens the southern board. From (9,4) next turn, body becomes [(9,4), (9,5), (8,5)]. Then safe moves: UP (9,5) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,4), RIGHT off-board. So two safe moves (DOWN, LEFT) from (9,4).\n\nBoth options give similar immediate mobility (2 safe moves next turn). However, UP moves generally toward the area with more apples (top-left), while DOWN moves toward an area with fewer apples currently. The enemy is in the top-left area, so moving UP increases potential for future conflict or apple contesting.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan consideration**\nI currently have a lead (2 apples vs enemy's 1). My primary goal is to survive and maintain/expand this lead. Moving UP keeps me closer to the apple cluster, which is good for scoring but also brings me closer to the enemy. The enemy is at (2,7), and the apples at (0,7) and (0,6) are nearby for them. If I move UP, I'm positioning myself to potentially intercept or compete for those apples over several turns. Moving DOWN might be safer in the short term, avoiding the enemy entirely and allowing me to loop around the bottom to collect the apple at (2,1) or (3,3) later.\n\nGiven my position against the right wall, I need to work my way leftward to access most apples. Moving UP to (9,6) allows a subsequent LEFT to (8,6), then further LEFT, creating a path toward the center. Moving DOWN to (9,4) also allows a LEFT to (8,4), then further LEFT. Both are reasonable.\n\nI'll choose UP because it aligns better with the concentration of apples and the natural flow of the board (snakes often spiral inward from edges). I'll need to be cautious of the enemy's movements toward the same apples.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (9,6), likely move LEFT to (8,6) to continue working toward the center and the apple cluster, unless the enemy's position makes that risky. Check for head-on collision possibilities with enemy #0, who may be moving toward (0,7) or (0,6).\n\nUP",

Possible enemy moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,7): its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,5): empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,6): off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6): empty.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are DOWN to (0,5) and RIGHT to (1,6). My safe squares are (7,7), (7,5), (6,6). None coincide with enemy's possible safe moves. No direct head\u2011on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\n- UP to (7,7): moves toward top edge. From (7,7), body becomes [(7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6)] (no apple eaten). Next turn safe moves: DOWN (7,6) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7), UP (7,8). Three safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP). This keeps me near top, away from most apples.\n- DOWN to (7,5): moves downward. From (7,5), body becomes [(7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6)]. Next turn safe moves: UP (7,6) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5). Three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).

The apple at (0,6) is gone (it was eaten last turn? Actually board shows no apple at (0,6) now). I should continue left/down toward the center apples. Moving LEFT to (6,6) keeps me on a path to eventually reach (2,3) and (3,3) while staying flexible. Moving DOWN to (7,5) also gives good options and starts heading toward the lower apples. Since I have 2 apples vs enemy's 3, I need to catch up. The cluster at (2,3)/(3,3) is closer from my position if I go left, while the lower apples are further. I'll prioritize the closer cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (6,6), assess enemy position. If enemy moves right, it may approach the same cluster. I should consider moving DOWN or LEFT next to avoid a potential head-on collision and to position for an apple. Keep at least two safe moves each turn.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #0 head is at (0,3), body [(0,4), (0,5), (0,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check**\n- UP \u2192 (5,6): contains my own body segment at (5,6) \u2192 **unsafe** (self-collision).\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4): empty, in bounds.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5): empty, in bounds.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5): empty, in bounds.\n\nAll moves except UP are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Risk of head\u2011on collision with enemy #0**\nEnemy head at (0,3). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,4): its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,2): empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,3): off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,3): empty.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are DOWN to (0,2) and RIGHT to (1,3). My safe squares are (5,4), (4,5), (6,5). None coincide with enemy's possible safe moves. No direct head\u2011on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\n- DOWN to (5,4): moves toward bottom. From (5,4), body becomes [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. Next turn safe moves: UP (5,5) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (5,3), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4). Three safe moves. Apple at (4,4) is adjacent to LEFT from (5,4). This is the closest apple.\n- LEFT to (4,5): moves left. From (4,5), body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. Next turn safe moves: UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5) my body \u2192 unsafe. Three safe moves. Apple at (4,4) is adjacent DOWN from (4,5).\n- RIGHT to (6,5): moves right. From (6,5), body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. Next turn safe moves: UP (6,6) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (7,5). Only one safe move (RIGHT). This is very dangerous as it traps me against the right wall with limited options. **Avoid RIGHT.**\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT lead to the apple at (4,4) in one more move. DOWN to (5,4) puts the apple directly to my LEFT. LEFT to (4,5) puts the apple directly DOWN. Manhattan distance to (4,4) is the same from both (5,4) and (4,5) (1 step). However, from (5,4), my next move LEFT to (4,4) eats the apple and my body will be [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. After eating, I'll have more space to maneuver downward toward other apples (2,1), (3,0). From (4,5), moving DOWN to (4,4) also eats it, but then my body is [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)], which may block my upward movement slightly more.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan**\nI'm behind in apples (2 vs 3). Securing the closest apple at (4,4) is critical. Moving DOWN to (5,4) seems slightly better because it keeps me closer to the lower apples for future turns and avoids the cluster where the enemy might eventually head. The enemy is in the top-left and moving away. My priority is to eat quickly and safely, maintaining mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (5,4), if the apple at (4,4) is still there, move LEFT to eat it. If not (e.g., if enemy somehow gets it), assess safety and move toward (2,1) or (3,0). Always check enemy's new position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

I can get there in 2 moves (DOWN to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3)).\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (4,3), assess safety and aim to move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple if it's still there and safe.

I just moved DOWN to (4,3) last turn.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check**\n- UP to (4,4): Contains my own body segment (the old head) \u2192 **unsafe** (self-collision).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty, in bounds.\n- LEFT to (3,3): Contains an apple at (3,3) \u2192 safe (eating apple).\n- RIGHT to (5,3): Empty, in bounds.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Risk of head\u2011on collision with enemy #0**\nEnemy head is at (2,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,3): Contains an apple.\n- DOWN to (2,1): Contains an apple.\n- LEFT to (1,2): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3,2): Empty.\n\nIts safe squares are (2,3), (2,1), (3,2). My safe squares are (4,2), (3,3), (5,3). No overlap, so no direct head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\nApples are at (2,1), (2,3), (3,3), (3,0), (3,1). I'm at (4,3).\n- DOWN to (4,2): Moves away from the apple cluster. From there, next turn I could go LEFT to (3,2) to approach apples (3,1) or (3,0), or DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. This seems less efficient for eating.\n- LEFT to (3,3): I would eat the apple at (3,3), growing to length 5. This gives me a point and extends my lead (4 apples vs enemy's 3). After eating, my new head is at (3,3) and my tail stays, so my body becomes [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]. This positions me well to potentially go DOWN to (3,2) next turn toward more apples, or LEFT to (2,3) for another apple.\n- RIGHT to (5,3): Moves away from all apples, into a more open but less productive area. From (5,3), apples are farther.\n\nLEFT to eat the apple at (3,3) is highly attractive. It directly increases my score, brings me into the dense apple zone, and is safe.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan and tiebreaker**\nMy plan from last turn was to move LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple if safe. It is safe. Eating now gives me a 4-to-3 apple lead and grows my body, which can help block the enemy later. The enemy might move toward (2,3) or (2,1) this turn. If it goes UP to (2,3), it will eat that apple and grow, but I'll have eaten (3,3). We'll both be at 4 apples. However, I'll be positioned at (3,3) and can consider moving to (2,3) next if the enemy leaves, or go DOWN to (3,2) toward other apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to eat is the most aggressive and aligned with the objective. It also keeps future options open: from (3,3) I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (UP would be into my new body at (4,3)? Wait, after eating, my body will be [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]. So UP to (3,4) is empty, DOWN to (3,2) empty, LEFT to (2,3) has an apple, RIGHT to (4,3) is my own body. So from (3,3) next turn, UP, DOWN, LEFT would be safe (RIGHT unsafe). That's three options\u2014good mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After eating at (3,3), assess safety. If enemy moves to (2,3), be cautious of a potential head-on if I go LEFT to (2,3) next turn. May consider going DOWN to (3,2) to approach apples (3,1) or (2,1) while avoiding collision. Priority is maintaining my apple lead and staying alive.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (3,3) and my body is [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]. I just moved LEFT to (3,3) last turn and ate the apple there, so I've grown to length 5. My score is now 5 apples, leading snake #0 which has 4.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check**\n- UP to (3,4): Empty, in bounds.\n- DOWN to (3,2): Empty, in bounds.\n- LEFT to (2,3): Contains an apple at (2,3) and is also the current head of snake #0. Moving into an enemy head square would cause a head-on collision if they also move into it. I must consider simultaneous movement.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Contains my own body (the segment immediately behind my head) \u2192 **unsafe** (self-collision).\n\nSo UP and DOWN are definitely safe. LEFT is conditionally safe only if snake #0 does not stay on (2,3) or move into (3,3). Since we move simultaneously, I need to evaluate enemy's possible moves.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy #0's move and assess collision risk**\nEnemy head is at (2,3), body: [(2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3)].\nIts safe moves (checking board and bodies):\n- UP to (2,4): Empty.\n- DOWN to (2,2): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Currently my head. If it moves RIGHT, it would move into my current head position, causing a head-on collision if I stay. But I am moving away, so this matters only if I move LEFT into (2,3) while it moves RIGHT into (3,3) \u2014 that's not a direct collision. The dangerous overlap is if we swap places (I go LEFT to (2,3), it goes RIGHT to (3,3)) \u2014 that's not a head-on because we end in different squares. A head-on requires we land in the same square.\n\nThe immediate head-on risk for LEFT is if enemy stays on (2,3) (by moving UP, DOWN, or LEFT? Wait, staying means not moving? No, staying isn't an option; it must choose a direction. If it chooses UP to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,3), then (2,3) becomes empty (its body moves). So if I move LEFT to (2,3), I would arrive into a square that is either empty or contains an apple (since the apple is there). The enemy head would have left that square. The only way for a head-on at (2,3) is if the enemy chooses RIGHT to (3,3) and I choose LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 that's not a collision. So moving LEFT is safe from immediate death, provided the square doesn't contain a body segment after movement. Let's check: After enemy moves, its body will follow. Its neck is at (2,2). If it moves UP to (2,4), its body becomes [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)]? Wait, it grows only if it eats an apple. It hasn't eaten this turn yet. So if it moves UP to (2,4) (no apple), its tail at (0,3) disappears, and its body shifts: head to (2,4), then (2,3) becomes its new second segment? Actually, the body list is head-to-tail. After moving without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment shifts forward, and the tail is removed. So if enemy moves UP to (2,4), its new body will be: head (2,4), then old head (2,3) becomes segment 2, then (2,2) becomes segment 3, then (1,2) becomes segment 4, and tail (0,2) is removed. So (2,3) becomes part of its body. That means if I move LEFT to (2,3) while enemy moves UP, I would move into its body segment (the old head position) and die. Similarly, if enemy moves LEFT to (1,3), its new body will be: head (1,3), then old head (2,3) becomes segment 2, etc. Again, (2,3) becomes its body. So if enemy moves UP or LEFT, (2,3) becomes an enemy body segment, and moving there would kill me. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3,3), (2,3) becomes empty? Let's see: if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,3), its new body: head (3,3), then old head (2,3) becomes segment 2, etc. So (2,3) still becomes its body segment. Actually, in all cases, the old head position becomes the new second segment. Therefore, (2,3) will be occupied by the enemy's body after its move, regardless of which direction it chooses (unless it eats an apple and grows, in which case the tail doesn't move and the old head remains the second segment? Wait, if it eats, it grows: head moves to new square, old head becomes second segment, and tail stays. So the old head position still becomes a body segment. So indeed, (2,3) will be part of enemy #0's body after this turn. Therefore, moving LEFT to (2,3) would move into an enemy body segment and cause my death. So LEFT is **unsafe**.\n\nThus, my only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\nApples at: (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (2,9), (1,8).\nFrom (3,3):\n- UP to (3,4): moves toward the upper apples (2,9) and (1,8) but they are far. Immediate area is open. From (3,4), next turn I could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN back to (3,3) might be safe depending on body).\n- DOWN to (3,2): moves toward the cluster of apples at (3,1), (3,0), (2,1). From (3,2), I could go DOWN to (3,1) (apple), LEFT to (2,2) (empty), or RIGHT to (4,2) (empty). That gives good options to collect apples quickly.\n\nDOWN seems more productive for increasing my apple lead. The enemy is at (2,3) and might also target the lower apples. If enemy moves DOWN? It can't, (2,2) is its own body. It will likely move UP or LEFT. If it moves UP to (2,4), it moves away from the lower apples. If it moves LEFT to (1,3), it's also moving away. So I have a chance to grab the (3,1) and (3,0) apples before it can loop around.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan**\nMy goal is to maintain and extend my apple lead (currently 5 vs 4). The dense apple cluster is in the bottom left. I should navigate toward (3,1) and (3,0) while keeping an eye on enemy movements. My body is forming a barrier along the right side, which could limit my space later, but the board is still open. I need to avoid getting trapped by my own tail. Moving DOWN now seems optimal for both safety and apple gathering.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After moving DOWN to (3,2), assess safety. If possible, move DOWN again to (3,1) to eat the apple, unless the enemy suddenly appears nearby. Keep monitoring enemy's head position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",
