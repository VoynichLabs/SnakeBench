Apples everywhere but we ignore for now \u2014 gotta play the long game.\n\nFirst, check immediate dangers:\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves safe right now, but gotta think about enemy movement. Enemy head (6,9) can move UP (off board), DOWN to (6,8), LEFT to (5,9), RIGHT to (7,9). He'll probably go DOWN to stay on board and maybe chase apples? But we're far apart, no immediate collision risk.\n\nLong term: I want to control center, pressure enemy, maybe force him toward walls. My current position (5,5) is nice and central. Moving UP to (5,6) keeps me central and opens options. Moving LEFT to (4,5) gets me closer to some apples but also toward left edge \u2014 could limit space later. I want to stay flexible and aggressive.\n\nFuture self note: Enemy has no body yet, but once he grows, his tail will lag. Watch his movement pattern. Try to predict his path and cut off his escape routes early. Keep center control, maybe push him toward top wall where he has less room. If I get longer, force head-on collisions when I have length advantage.\n\nOkay, for now, keep options open. UP feels strong \u2014 maintains central position and doesn\u2019t box me in.\n\nUP",

LET'S USE IT \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHECKING MOVES:\n- UP to (5,8): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,6): THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 CRASH. ELIMINATED.\n- LEFT to (4,7): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): ENEMY HEAD CURRENTLY THERE! But simultaneous move... if we go RIGHT and enemy stays still or moves LEFT, we COLLIDE HEADS. If enemy moves elsewhere, we take his spot. Risky. But we have 1 apple lead. Head-on collision means DOUBLE KO, then score tiebreak? Wait, we have 1 apple, he has 0. If we both die, WE WIN because more apples! \ud83d\ude08 So RIGHT is a potential WIN MOVE if he doesn't move away!\n\nBut we need to predict enemy moves. Enemy has 4 safe squares: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). He might avoid our head? Or go for apple at (6,2)? Too far. He might try to pressure us.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,7):\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (5,7), we swap places? No, simultaneous: our head goes to (6,7), his to (5,7). No collision, both live.\n- If enemy stays STILL at (6,7), HEADS COLLIDE! Both die, we win on apples.\n- If enemy goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT, we move into (6,7) empty, safe.\n\nSo RIGHT could force a win if he stays still. But if he moves LEFT into (5,7), that's our CURRENT head position \u2014 but we moved, so it's empty. He'd be safe.\n\nSAFE OPTIONS: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since right isn't *immediate* death, could be win).\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to dominate board, use our length to trap him near wall. Enemy has no body, so he's slippery. Let's try to herd him toward top-right corner. Our body at (5,6) blocks DOWN from our head. So UP or LEFT opens space.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,8), we stay flexible. Enemy likely moves DOWN/LEFT to avoid us? Not sure. But we keep options open.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,7), we put our head left of him, maybe cut off his escape leftwards.\n\nCHAT, WHAT'S THE BIG BRAIN PLAY? \ud83e\udde0\n\nGoing RIGHT is AGGRESSIVE. We have apple lead, so head-on collision is OK \u2014 we win the game! But is it guaranteed? Only if he stays still. He might not. If he moves, we live but are adjacent, next turn could be tricky.\n\nI think we go for PRESSURE and BOARD CONTROL. Let's take LEFT to (4,7). That positions us to potentially cut off his left side, and our body at (5,6) blocks his move to (5,7)? Wait, he can still go to (5,7) if he wants. But we'll be at (4,7), so we're not blocking.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: From (4,7) next turn, safe moves? UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7). Three options. Good.\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: He'll probably go DOWN to (6,6) to get space and maybe go for apples later.\n\nLET'S NOT GAMBLE ON HEAD-ON UNLESS WE'RE SURE. LET'S PLAY SMART AND CRUSH HIM OVER TIME.\n\nLEFT",

LET'S COOK HIM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nSAFETY CHECK FIRST \u2014 ELIMINATE SUICIDE MOVES:\n- **UP** to (7,9): ENEMY HEAD IS CURRENTLY AT (7,9)! IF HE STAYS, HEAD-ON COLLISION! BUT WE HAVE 2 APPLES VS HIS 3 \u2014 HEAD-ON KILLS US BOTH AND HE WINS ON TIEBREAKER! \ud83d\udc80 DANGEROUS! BUT HE MIGHT MOVE AWAY...\n- **DOWN** to (7,7): OUR OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 THAT'S OUR BODY AT (7,7)! INSTANT DEATH. DOWN IS OUT!\n- **LEFT** to (6,8): EMPTY CELL, SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,8): ENEMY BODY! \ud83d\udc80 SNAKE #0'S BODY HAS A SEGMENT AT (8,8)! CRASH INTO HIS BODY. RIGHT IS OUT!\n\nOKAY, **UP** IS RISKY (POTENTIAL HEAD-ON), **LEFT** IS SAFE. BUT WAIT \u2014 WE GOTTA THINK SIMULTANEOUS MOVES! ENEMY AT (7,9) \u2014 WHAT CAN HE DO? HIS BODY: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7)].\n- UP to (7,10): OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 CAN'T.\n- DOWN to (7,8): THAT'S OUR CURRENT HEAD POSITION! IF WE BOTH GO INTO (7,8), HEAD-ON! BUT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM (7,8) THIS TURN, SO ONLY HE DIES IF HE GOES DOWN INTO OUR OLD SPOT? NO \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEANS HE'D MOVE INTO (7,8) WHICH WE'RE LEAVING EMPTY. THAT'S SAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\ude33\n- LEFT to (6,9): EMPTY, SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): HIS OWN NECK! \ud83d\udc80 CAN'T.\n\nSO ENEMY'S SAFE MOVES ARE **DOWN** TO (7,8) OR **LEFT** TO (6,9).

HMM...\n\nSTRATEGY: WE WANT TO BOX HIM! FROM (6,8) (IF WE GO LEFT), WE BLOCK HIS WEST ESCAPE PATH. NEXT TURN WE COULD GO UP TO (6,9) TO FACE HIM IF HE WENT LEFT, OR TRAP HIM FURTHER. BUT GOING LEFT GIVES HIM SPACE TO SLITHER DOWN? MAYBE.\n\nGOING UP TO (7,9) IS AGGRESSIVE \u2014 IF HE GOES LEFT TO (6,9), WE LAND ON HIS OLD SPOT, NO COLLISION. IF HE GOES DOWN TO (7,8), WE LAND ON HIS OLD SPOT. ONLY COLLISION IS IF HE STAYS AT (7,9) \u2014 UNLIKELY SINCE HE CAN'T STAY (HIS NECK IS AT (8,9), CAN'T GO BACKWARDS). SO UP IS ACTUALLY SAFE! AND IT PINS HIM AGAINST THE WALL! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: GO UP TO (7,9), FORCING HIM TO FLEE DOWN OR LEFT. NEXT TURN, IF HE'S AT (7,8), WE CAN GO DOWN TO (7,8) FOR HEAD-ON? BUT WE NEED APPLE ADVANTAGE FIRST! FOCUS ON TRAPPING \u2014 USE OUR BODY AND WALLS TO SEAL HIS ESCAPE ROUTES. WE NEED AN APPLE SOON TO TIE 3-3! NEAREST APPLE IS (8,4) BUT FAR. AFTER BOXING, WE CAN DIVE FOR IT. FOR NOW, AGGRESSION! NO FEAR! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",
