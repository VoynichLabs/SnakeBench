We're starting fresh, head at (5,1), no body, and that idiot's at (0,8) looking lost. Apples everywhere\u2014(3,0) is RIGHT there, a quick dine for us! Look at that apple drop list: (3,0), (1,1), (3,4), (3,5)\u2014bottom-left cluster is calling our name. We gotta box him in later and crash him out, but first, we EAT and GROW. No dying today!!\n\nConsidering all four moves from (5,1):\n- UP: To (5,2). Safe, empty, gets us moving upwards towards more space and apples like (3,5) or (7,8), keeping the board open. But why waste moves not heading to instant noms?\n- DOWN: To (5,0). Safe, empty, but heads to the edge, limits future up options later. Nah, we ain't cornering ourselves early.\n- LEFT: To (4,1). Safe, empty, straight shot towards (3,0)\u2014eat in 2-3 moves total? Yes! Plus, it's not trapping us, lots of wiggle room left, right, up. Opens paths to (1,1) or (3,4) next. And chat, this sets us up to pivot right after eating, blocking that punk from coming down the middle.\n- RIGHT: To (6,1). Safe, empty, but moves us away from easy apples, out towards nothing immediate. Why go right when left feasts us fast?\n\nEliminate? None kill us\u2014board's fine, no bodies to crash into yet. Favor LEFT: closest to (3,0), multiple safe follow-ups (up, right to pivot around), avoids dead-ends, and doesn't set up easy head-ons since he's wayyyy over at (0,8). We can slither back right after eating to patrol the apple fields and wall him off!\n\nChat agrees? We WON'T let him eat squat\u2014we're the predator here, eating our way to 30 and crushing his skull!! Plan for next few turns (to my future self): Eat that (3,0) quick, grow strong, then snake right a bit to guard the center/spoil left apples like (1,1). Head up later to box his ass in near (0,8)\u2014don't let him crash into US when we grow, use that rule to our advantage. If he heads down, we'll be ready to collide and kill!\n\nLEFT",

Our head's lurking at (4,1), no body yet, zero apples, but we're about to CHANGE THAT!!

We could go up forever, but that's delaying the feast, and we AIN'T no patient predator here!!\n\n- DOWN to (4,0): Ohhh tempting with that edge flirting, empty and safe, but HELLO it's the wall at y=0\u2014NXT moves get sticky, limited UP options if I eat later, and it boxes US in more than HIM? Nah, we ain't handing him the keys to the kingdom by cornering ourselves early\u2014he might slither down and collide for a double KO, but we want HIS head, not ours!! \ud83d\ude24\n\n- LEFT to (3,1): SAFE, empty, and BAM\u2014puts us on the fast track to (3,0)! Column 3 is apple CENTRAL, chat: (3,0) right there, (3,4), (3,5)\u2014we LEFT to (3,1), nxt turn DOWN to chow down and GROW our first segment!!

Why retreat when we can ADVANCE?? Gets us ZERO closer to noms, and chat, that's just BORING strategy; it keeps space but wastes a turn we could use to munch and multiply!\n\nEliminates? NONE gonna kill us immediately\u2014board's huge and open, no bodies, rival's not adjacent. Favor LEFT: instant apple proximity, multiple safe follow-ups (UP, RIGHT, LEFT still), creeps towards (3,0) for that grow AND blocks potential rival paths to left-side apples. Keeps the board OPEN for our boxing brilliance\u2014don't let him sneak into those bottom fields like (1,1) or (6,3)!! We EAT, we GROW, we CONQUER!! Who's with me to crush him under our expanding tail??? \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4f\n\nPlan for nxt few turns (to future me): Slurp that (3,0) ASAP with DOWN nxt, grow to 1 segment, THEN immediately RIGHT from there (from new head at (3,0)) to (4,0)\u2014guard the center and spoil his lefties like (1,1). If he dives for bottom apples, we'll be in position to wall him off near (4,0) or UP around x=4-5 to fence him into x=1 with our body later. Watch his moves\u2014 if he heads DOWN from (1,8), pivot LEFT to intercept and force a collision in our favor. Keep growing fast, aim for 5-10 apples before he does, then SLITHER up to surround his starting zone and CRASH him OUT!!! Don't die stupid, use simultaneous moves to our advantage.

Our head just slithered to (3,1) from that solid LEFT last turn, and now we're STARING down the board, ready to BITE into some CONTENT!! Apples glowing like neon signs: (3,0) RIGHT THERE for the taking, plus a buffet in column 3 and beyond. Let's DISSECT this gig\u2014who's hyped to expand our empire and FORCE a crash? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nBreaking down those FOUR DIRECTIONS from (3,1)\u2014board's wide open, no traps or bodies yet (dumb rival's not close enough to head-on us this round), and we're all about that EATING and BOXING life!! Remember, apples pop everywhere, opponent slithers SAME TIME, and we gotta GROW FAST to SURROUND his sorry ass later!\n\n- UP to (3,2): SAFE, empty cell, tons of breathing room\u2014no walls, opens UP more space to roam towards mid-board noms like (3,5), (4,8), or even (4,9). Keeps options FLEXIBLE: from there, I could weave LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again, dodging tight spots. But why climb when DEVOUR is down below? It's okay, but delays the GROWTH we NEED to outscore that loser\u2014don't wanna let him sneak first bites without us pivoting!\n\n- DOWN to (3,0): OH HELL YES\u2014LANDING ON THAT JUICY APPLE!!! Grows us +1 segment IMMEDIATELY, +1 point, and BOOM\u2014now we got a BODY to start WALLING paths. Safe af, empty except the snack, keeps the door WIDE open: from new head at (3,0), RIGHT to (4,0) guards the central lanes against his dives, or UP back into column 3 for (3,4)/(3,5). Zero dead-ends here, chat\u2014we advance, we block, we set up to COLLIDE him if he heads south for (1,1). This is the aggression we want\u2014EAT NOW, THRIVE LATER!! Who's with me on that POWER MOVE? \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n- LEFT to (2,1): Also SAFE, empty, creeps us further left\u2014closer to bullripping potential rival approaches, but AWAY from immediate noms? We could pivot towards (1,1), but that's HIS playground, and we ain't sharing. Opens UP/DOWN/LEFT still, but why not prioritize the GUARANTEED GROWTH while it's hot? Misses out on shoving apples down our gullet this turn\u2014weak sauce!\n\n- RIGHT to (4,1): SAFE, empty, circles right towards the mid board\u2014options galore (UP/DOWN/RIGHT again), spots like (4,8)/(4,9) later, but NO EAT HERE? That's just dilly-dallying, chat\u2014 wAsTs a perfect chance to GAIN LENGTH and POINTS!! Keeps space but lets the rival breathe, and we're not in the forgiveness business. Trash move for a CHAMPION like us!\n\nEliminates? NONE\u2014board's endless juice, no self-hits, no enemy bodies adjacent, no boards popping OFF yet. Favor DOWN 100%\u2014we GROW, we dominate, we force him into our web. Alive, eating pumpkin , options wide (at least 3 nxt), all while creeping towards BOXING brilliance. If he DIPS DOWN from (2,8), this sets up a RIGHT intercept to slam his head into our new body. We're building a LEGACY here\u2014don't choke on your own tail!\n\nPlan for nxt few turns (to future me): Chomp that (3,0) with DOWN, grow to 1 segment (new head (3,0), tail (3,1)), THEN RIGHT nxt to (4,0) for central control\u2014spoil his (1,1) dreams and trap him near x=1 if he plunges south. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW with UP to (4,1), then RIGHT to (5,1) or UP more to fence the area around x=4-5. If he zigzags up or right, keep eating column 3/4 apples ((3,4),(3,5),(4,8),(4,9)) while letting our body EX-PAND to block his lines later. Hit 5-10 apples quick, WATCH HIS MOVES\u2014 if he heads left/down early, pivot LEFT at (4,0) to (3,0) then UP to flank and COLLIDE his head. No stupid deaths, use simuls to our edge, GROW BIGGER FIRST, then ENCIRCLE his spawn zone from below. Win by CRASHING him or out-eating to 30\u2014let's MAKE THIS LIVE LEGENDARY!! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

DEATH BY SELF-OWNAGE!! UP TO (4,1): BOARD'S CALLING, Y=1 ROW'S EMPTY SPOT WAITING ((4,1) LOOKS CLEAR-BASED ON THE MAP), GIVING US BREATHING ROOM TO EXPAND NORTH WITHOUT BODIES CALLING OUR NUMBER! RIGHT TO (5,0): CLEAR AS DAY AT X=5, EMPTY AND PROMISING, BUT IS IT OUR POWER PLAY?! ELIMINATED: DOWN (CLIFF FAIL) AND LEFT (TAIL TAP-OUT).

THEN, IF CLEAR, UP AGAIN TO (5,2) OR LEFT TO (4,2) BASED ON HIS HEAD\u2014PIVOT LEFT IF HE DIPS DOWN TO Y=7-8 FOR FLANK JESUS, RIGHT IF HE GOES LEFT. CHOMP ANY (4,5),(3,5),(6,5) EN ROUTE (HIT THOSE FAST FOR GROWTH O.D.), PUSH TO 5+ APPLES QUICKER THAN HIM, SPEARCHECK FOR SIMUL SUICIDES (EVIL IF HE MIRRORS RIGHT), AND START BOXING FROM BELOW\u2014FENCE COLUMN 3-6, FORCE HIS COLLISIONS ON OUR BODIES OR 30-STEAL.
