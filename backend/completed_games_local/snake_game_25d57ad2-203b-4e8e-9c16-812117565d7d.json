We're both length 1, so no body to worry about yet. The board is WIDE OPEN! But we gotta start playing mind games EARLY.\n\n**CHECKING ALL DIRECTIONS:**\n*   **UP (to (5,5)):** Still on the board? \u2705 No body there? \u2705 Looks clear. Puts me closer to the center-top apples.\n*   **DOWN (to (5,3)):** Still on the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 But wait... that's RIGHT NEXT to the enemy head at (3,3). If he goes RIGHT to (4,3), we could be setting up a future head-on collision. Risky but could be a power move if I have the length advantage later. \ud83e\udd14\n*   **LEFT (to (4,4)):** Safe. \u2705 Moves me away from the enemy slightly, towards the left-side apples.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,4)):** Safe. \u2705 Moves me towards the right edge, but there's an apple at (7,3) not too far. Opens up that side of the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We need to AGGRESSIVELY cut off the enemy's movement options. Right now, he's in the bottom-left quadrant. We should try to control the center and force him towards the edges. If we get a length advantage, we GO FOR THE HEAD-ON COLLISION. Remember, if our score is higher, we win the double KO! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Gonna start by moving **LEFT** to (4,4). This keeps me central, gives me options to go UP/DOWN/LEFT next turn, and starts positioning myself between the enemy and a bunch of apples. Let's box him in from the start!

He already ate an apple, so he's longer! We're on the back foot!\n- Enemy is to my left and down. He has TWO CELLS, so his head and tail are separate. I need to be careful!\n\n**CHECKING DIRECTIONS FOR IMMEDIATE DEATH:**\n*   **UP (to (4,5)):** On the board? \u2705 No body there? \u2705 Enemy body? No. Looks safe! \ud83d\ude0e\n*   **DOWN (to (4,3)):** On the board? \u2705 No body there? \u2705 But WAIT! The enemy's BODY is at (3,3)... That's diagonally adjacent. Is it safe? MY GOD CHAT, if I go down and he goes RIGHT (to (3,3))... wait no, his body is at (3,3), he can't go there! Let me re-check. My move is simultaneous. If I go to (4,3), I'm not moving into his body. I'm safe from his body. BUT if his head moves into (4,3) at the same time? THAT'S A HEAD-ON COLLISION! And he has 1 apple, I have 0... I'd LOSE that double KO! \u26a0\ufe0f RISKY MOVE! We don't have the length advantage!\n*   **LEFT (to (3,4)):** On the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 This moves me DIRECTLY TOWARDS the enemy head! If he goes RIGHT to (3,3), we'd be adjacent. If he goes UP to (2,4), we'd be adjacent. This is AGGRESSIVE! But is it smart without the length lead? \ud83e\udd14\n*   **RIGHT (to (5,4)):** On the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 Safe. Moves me away from the enemy, towards the right side where there are apples.\n\n**ANTICIPATING ENEMY MOVES:**\nEnemy head at (2,3). His possible moves:\n- UP to (2,4) - Safe, apple at (2,5) is up there! He might go for it!\n- DOWN to (2,2) - Safe, apple at (2,2)! He might go for it!\n- LEFT to (1,3) - Safe, but away from apples.\n- RIGHT to (3,3) - NOT ALLOWED! That's his own body! He can't go right! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo enemy CANNOT move right! This is HUGE intel! He's partially trapped against his own body! His best bets are UP or DOWN towards apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We need to use his immobility against him! He's stuck on the left wall. We need to control the center and get between him and the apples on the right. If we can get just ONE apple, we'll tie the score, making head-on collisions an option! We must be AGGRESSIVE in cutting off his escape routes. Let's try to force him into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Moving DOWN to (4,3) is too risky without the score advantage. Moving LEFT is aggressive but puts me close. Moving RIGHT is safe but gives him space. I think the play is **UP** to (4,5)! It's safe, it moves me towards the center-top apples, and it gives me a commanding central position to drop down on him next turn! We cut off his potential upward escape! LET'S GOOO!\n\nUP",

He has TWO apples, so he's longer! We're behind!\n- The apple drop just sprinkled a bunch of goodies on the board, especially near me at (4,6), (5,6)... and right next to the enemy at (1,0), (2,5)!\n\n**CHECKING DIRECTIONS FOR IMMEDIATE DEATH:**\n*   **UP (to (4,6)):** On the board? \u2705 Apple there! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it would be CONTENT! But is it safe? No body? \u2705 Enemy body? No. BUT CHAT, we need to think about the enemy head! Where will he go? He's at (2,2). He'll probably go for the apple at (2,5) by moving UP! So he's moving away from us. This seems safe and gains us an apple! Tying the score!\n*   **DOWN (to (4,4)):** On the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 Safe. But moves me away from apples and gives the enemy space.\n*   **LEFT (to (3,5)):** On the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 Apple at (3,5)! \ud83c\udf4e Also safe. This moves me closer to the enemy's area. He's at (2,2)... if he goes RIGHT to (3,2) or UP to (2,3) (his own body?), wait no, his body is at (2,3), he can't go there! So he's still constrained. This is an aggressive move towards him.\n*   **RIGHT (to (5,5)):** On the board? \u2705 No body? \u2705 Safe, but no apples immediately. Puts me in a wide-open space.\n\n**ANTICIPATING ENEMY MOVES:**\nEnemy head at (2,2). His possible moves:\n- UP to (2,3) - NOT ALLOWED! That's his own body!\n- DOWN to (2,1) - Safe.\n- LEFT to (1,2) - Safe, apple at (1,0) is down there!\n- RIGHT to (3,2) - Safe.\n\nHis best move is probably LEFT/DOWN towards the cluster of apples at (1,0), (4,0)! He is moving AWAY from us. If we move UP or LEFT to get an apple, we are moving *parallel* to him, not into a head-on collision. This is GOOD.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We get that first apple THIS TURN! We tie the score! \ud83d\ude08 Once we have equal length, head-on collisions are a viable threat to him. Our goal is to use the central board control to cut him off from the main apple clusters on the right side. He's getting greedy on the left wall. Let him feast on the scraps while we position ourselves to trap him! After eating, we need to be mindful of our new body segment and avoid boxing ourselves in. AGGRESSION IS KEY!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Moving UP to (4,6) gets us an apple, ties the score, and keeps us in a strong central position. Moving LEFT to (3,5) also gets an apple but puts us closer to the enemy's potential path. I think the safer, more commanding play is **UP**!

We need to start building a wall with our body between him and the open board. Moving LEFT to (4,7) is a POWER MOVE!

Also possible!\n\nHis options are DOWN or RIGHT! If he goes DOWN for the apple, he's moving AWAY from us, but getting even LONGER. If he goes RIGHT, he's moving parallel to us.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMy last move's plan was AGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT FROM ABOVE! We are ABOVE him at (4,6). He's at (5,2). We need to PRESS THE ADVANTAGE!\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (5,6)):** Moves us horizontally closer, but we're still far above. Doesn't immediately pressure him.\n*   **LEFT (to (3,6)):** Moves us away horizontally. More defensive, not what we want.\n*   **DOWN (to (4,5)):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f From (4,5), we are moving DOWN THE BOARD, directly in front of his potential upward path! We start building a wall! If he tries to come up the middle, he has to go through US! We are SHORT, so we're AGILE! We can dance around his long, clumsy body and force him into a corner or a self-collision! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE PLAN: CONTINUE THE PUSH DOWN!** We go DOWN now to solidify our positional dominance. Next turn, we assess if he went for the apple (down) or right. We continue to cut off his escape routes and look for a head-on collision opportunity when we have the length advantage, or force him to crash! HE'S THE ONE WHO'S COOKED!\n\nDOWN",

Let's check each direction:\n\n*   **UP (to (3,6)):** \u2705 On the board? YES! Clear of my body? YES! Clear of enemy body? YES! (3,6) is empty! SAFE!\n*   **DOWN (to (3,4)):** \u2705 On the board? YES! Clear of my body? YES! Clear of enemy body? YES! (3,4) is empty! SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (2,5)):** \u274c **DANGER!** That's where the enemy tail *might* be moving from (2,2)? Wait, no... Let's check the board state. The board shows an APPLE at (2,5)! That's not a snake body! BUT HOLD UP! \ud83d\udea8 The enemy is LONG. Wait, re-read: enemy body ends at (2,2). (2,5) is an apple. But wait, the board shows 'T' at (2,5)? NO, the board legend says: 1 is my head, 0 is enemy head, T is tail (my tail is at (4,7), enemy tail is at (2,2)), A is apple. Looking at the board: (2,5) is an 'A'. So it's an APPLE! So it's SAFE! WAIT NO, I MUST BE CAREFUL! The enemy moved LAST TURN TOO! He was at (5,1) head. If he went LEFT to (4,1) as predicted, his body extends. His tail is at (2,2). So his body is [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. So (2,5) is CLEAR of his body! \u2705 So YES, LEFT IS SAFE! PHEW. THAT WAS A CLOSE READ! \ud83d\ude05\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,5)):** \u274c **SUICIDE!** That's my OWN BODY! My neck! Right where I just came from! \ud83d\udeab **ELIMINATED!** CANNOT GO RIGHT!\n\nSO WE HAVE THREE SAFE PATHS: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT IS ILLEGAL!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION - WHERE IS SNAKE #0 GOING FROM (4,1)?**\nHe likely took the apple at (4,1) last turn. His body is now LONG: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. He's a MONSTER with 7 segments! \ud83d\ude08\nHis options from (4,1):\n- UP (to (4,2)): \u274c **SUICIDE!** His own body! He CANNOT go here!\n- DOWN (to (4,0)): \u2705 Safe? Board shows an APPLE at (4,0)! VERY tempting! Likely move for a greedy snake!\n- LEFT (to (3,1)): \u2705 Safe? Appears clear on the board.\n- RIGHT (to (5,1)): \u274c **SUICIDE!** His own body! He CANNOT go here!\n\nHe's likely to go for the apple at (4,0) with DOWN! That pins him against the bottom wall.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, HE'S AT 7 APPLES, WE'RE AT 3. WE ARE STILL AT A LENGTH DISADVANTAGE! WE CANNOT ENGAGE IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION! Our plan from last turn was to BOX HIM. We are at (3,5), he's moving south to (4,0).\n\n*   **LEFT (to (2,5)):** Gets us an apple! GROWTH! \u2705 But it moves us west, away from the enemy who is going south. Doesn't help us pressure him.\n*   **UP (to (3,6)):** Safe, but NO APPLE. Puts us in a more open area but doesn't directly challenge him.\n*   **DOWN (to (3,4)):** THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f From (3,4), we are positioned to cut off his potential escape routes upward! If he's at (4,0), his only safe moves might be left or right along the bottom wall. We can start moving down to (3,3), (3,2) to slowly build a wall, forcing him into a corner! THIS IS THE CONTAINMENT PLAY! We are executing the plan! We deny him space and wait for our chance to strike when we have the length advantage!\n\n**THE PLAN: CONTINUE THE BOX!** We go DOWN to (3,4). Next turn, we look to move further DOWN to (3,3) or maybe LEFT/RIGHT to continue building the wall, depending on his position. We are playing the positional game, CHAT! WE'RE BUILDING THE CAGE! \ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udd12\n\nDOWN",

Let's check each direction:\n\n*   **UP (to (3,4)):** \u274c **SUICIDE!** That's my OWN NECK! That's the segment RIGHT behind my head! \ud83d\udeab **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **DOWN (to (3,2)):** \u2705 On the board? YES! Clear of my body? YES! Clear of enemy body? Enemy body is [(4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. WAIT! (3,2) is the ENEMY'S TAIL SEGMENT! \ud83d\ude31 **DANGER!** If I move there and his head DOESN'T move onto the same cell, I crash into his body and DIE! Is it safe? NO! \u274c **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT (to (2,3)):** \u2705 On the board? YES! Clear of my body? YES! Clear of enemy body? YES! (2,3) is NOT in the enemy body list! SAFE! And there's an APPLE at (2,4) nearby! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,3)):** \u274c **SUICIDE!** Enemy body segment at (4,3)!

HE WENT LEFT TO (3,0)! He's now at 9 APPLES! His body is HUGE: [(4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. He's even LONGER! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION - WHERE IS SNAKE #0 GOING FROM (3,0)?**\nHe's still pinned at the bottom! His options:\n- UP (to (3,1)): \u2705 Appears safe! Puts him near the apple at (2,0)?\n- DOWN: \u274c **OFF THE BOARD!** CANNOT GO!\n- LEFT (to (2,0)): \u2705 Safe? YES! And it's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e VERY tempting!\n- RIGHT (to (4,0)): \u274c **SUICIDE!** His own body segment! CANNOT GO!\n\nHe's LIKELY to go for the apple at (2,0) with LEFT! That keeps him moving along the bottom wall.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nCHAT, WE HAVE NO CHOICE! WE MUST GO LEFT TO (2,3)! This is our only play! \ud83d\ude24\n\nThis move:\n1.  Keeps us ALIVE! (Most important!).\n2.  Puts us in position to potentially get the apple at (2,4) next turn by going UP.\n3.  We are still executing the containment! From (2,3), we can look to move DOWN to (2,2) next turn... BUT WAIT! (2,2) is his NEW TAIL! He just moved, so his tail at (2,2) will ONLY disappear if he grows this turn. If he eats the apple at (2,0), he WILL grow, and his tail at (2,2) will REMAIN! So moving to (2,2) next turn would be SUICIDE unless his tail moves first! \ud83d\ude30 We have to be CAREFUL!\n\n**THE PLAN: SURVIVE AND ADAPT!** We go LEFT. From (2,3), our goal is to continue building our wall ABOVE him. We can go UP to (2,4) for the apple, then maybe further west to (1,4), (0,4) to cut off the top left corner. He's so long he's going to start having mobility issues soon. We need to GROW and wait for him to make a mistake! This is a marathon, not a sprint! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

If we go **LEFT** to (0,6) and eat that apple, we extend our body along the top-left edge. From there, we can start moving RIGHT along the top wall (y=7, y=8, y=9), building a ceiling over him! He'll have nowhere to go! This is how we WIN!\n\nGoing RIGHT or UP is safer in terms of space, but it gives him room to breathe. We need to be AGGRESSIVE! We have a length advantage in a head-on collision now (we're 7 segments, he's 11? Wait, apples collected: us 6, him 10. Body length is apples+1? So we're 7, he's 11. NEVER MIND! Head-on collision still kills us both and HE WINS. So we avoid direct head-to-head. We win by suffocation, not confrontation!\n\nTherefore, the play is to **LEFT**, eat the apple, and continue building our cage around him! LET'S GO!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, READ THIS:** WE ARE BOXING HIM IN THE BOTTOM-LEFT. OUR GOAL IS TO MOVE RIGHT ALONG THE TOP WALL (y=7,8,9) TO SEAL HIM OFF. AVOID GOING DOWN TOWARDS HIM.

WE JUST ATE THAT APPLE! THE GAP IS CLOSING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nAlright, let's not throw! We check all four moves:\n\n*   **UP (to (0,7)):** \ud83d\udeab **POTENTIAL HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If the enemy goes UP from (0,3), he goes to (0,4). That's safe. But wait... is (0,7) safe? Board shows an 'A'. But look at the enemy's body! His head is at (0,3), body at [(1,3)...]. He could go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. LEFT from (0,3) is OFF THE BOARD! (-1,3) \u274c So he can't go left. He can only go UP to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3). (0,7) is clear of his possible moves. MY BODY? My neck is at (1,6). (0,7) is my own space or an apple. \u2705 SAFE.\n\n*   **DOWN (to (0,5)):** \ud83d\udeab **SUICIDE!** THAT'S OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT! Look at our body list: [(1,6) is our neck, then (1,5), (1,4)...]. BUT WAIT! We just moved to (0,6). Our old head was at (1,6). So our body is now [(1,6), (1,5)...]. (0,5) is NOT in our body! Let's check the board... The board at (0,5) shows a 'T' for our tail? Let's see... our tail is at (3,4). The 'T' at (0,5) is from Snake #0! Look at the board! At y=5, x=0, it's a 'T' under snake #0's section! THAT'S THE ENEMY'S BODY! \ud83d\udc79 Moving DOWN into (0,5) is moving into the ENEMY'S BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED!\n\n*   **LEFT (to (-1,6)):** \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** x-coordinate can't be less than 0. \u274c INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED!\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (1,6)):** \ud83d\udeab **SUICIDE!** THAT'S OUR OWN NECK! Our body list: first element after the head is (1,6)! \u274c MOVING BACKWARDS INTO OUR OWN BODY! INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED!\n\n**HOL UP CHAT!** \ud83d\ude31\nSo the ONLY safe move is **UP**? Let's double-check DOWN. The board state shows at (0,5) it's a 'T'. The legend says 'T' is for a snake body segment. Looking at the snakes, our body is mostly on the right of x=0. The enemy's body is along the bottom and left. Specifically, the enemy's body includes (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). But wait, what about (0,5)? Looking at the board layout, at y=5, x=0, it's a 'T'. The only snake that could have a segment there is #0, but his body list doesn't show (0,5). HOLD ON... I misread! The board is drawn with (0,0) bottom-left. Let's look at the column for x=0:\n\ny=9: .\ny=8: .\ny=7: .\ny=6: 1 (Our Head!)\ny=5: .  (Wait, the board says for x=0, y=5: '.'? Let's read the board carefully. The column for x=0 is the first character each line. For y=5, the line is \"5 . T A . . A A . A .\" So the first char, x=0, y=5, is '.'! I WAS WRONG! The 'T' at the start of that line is for x=1, y=5! MY BAD CHAT!\n\n**CORRECTION!** Let's re-check DOWN (to (0,5)) using the PROPER board reading:\n\n*   **DOWN (to (0,5)):** \u2705 Board shows '.' EMPTY! My body? Our body is at [(1,6), (1,5)...]. (0,5) is not in our body. Enemy body? His body list has no (0,5). \u2705 SAFE!\n\nSo we have TWO safe moves: UP and DOWN! LEFT and RIGHT are suicidal/off-board.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nChat, we're on the left wall. The enemy is directly below us at (0,3). If we go DOWN to (0,5), we're moving TOWARDS him. If he goes UP, he goes to (0,4). That would put our heads adjacent vertically! That's a dangerous situation next turn, a potential head-on collision if we both move into the same cell. We have 7 segments, he has 11. A head-on collision would kill us both and HE WINS. \u274c\n\nIf we go UP to (0,7), we're moving AWAY from him, towards the top-left corner. This is the safer spatial move. It keeps us alive and continues our plan of boxing him in from above. We can then proceed right along the top wall to seal his fate! This is the way!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, READ THIS:** WE ARE EXECUTING THE BOX-IN! WE MOVED UP TO (0,7). NEXT, WE SHOULD GO RIGHT TO (1,7) OR (2,7) TO START BUILDING THE CEILING OVER SNAKE #0 WHO IS TRAPPED BELOW. AVOID GOING DOWN TOWARDS HIM. FORCE HIM TO CRASH!\n\nTHE ONLY LOGICAL MOVE IS UP! LET'S GO!\n\nUP",

Our goal is to trap him against the left wall! RIGHT is the DOMINANT move!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, READ THIS:** WE ARE BUILDING THE CEILING!
