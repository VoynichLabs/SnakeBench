Moves toward (2, 3) apple (distance 2).\n2. **RIGHT (6, 3)**: This is where my body is - DEATH. Moving into my own body. Eliminated.\n3. **UP (5, 4)**: Safe - within bounds, no collision. **APPLE HERE!** This is one of the nearest apples, distance 0. Excellent move.\n4. **DOWN (5, 2)**: Safe - within bounds, no collision. No apple here. Moves away from nearby apples.\n\n**Safe moves remaining:** LEFT, UP, DOWN\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n\n**UP (5, 4):**\n- **Immediately collects apple at (5, 4)** - this gives me apple #4, taking the lead 4-3\n- After eating, my snake grows to length 5\n- This is a critical scoring move - gives me the lead for the first time\n- From (5, 4), I can continue UP to (5, 5), (5, 6), etc. or go LEFT to reach (2, 3)\n- No enemy collision risk - enemy is at (3, 6), far from this position\n\n**LEFT (4, 3):**\n- Moves toward (2, 3) apple but doesn't collect it immediately\n- Delays scoring compared to UP move\n- Less efficient\n\n**DOWN (5, 2):**\n- Moves away from available apples\n- Wasteful and moves me toward the board edge\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy at (3, 6) with body [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]\n- They are moving in the upper-left area\n- No immediate collision threat from my UP move\n- My move to (5, 4) is safe\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the optimal choice. It collects an apple immediately, gives me the lead (4-3), and sets me up to continue toward (5, 5) or pivot left toward (3, 7) or (3, 9) apples. This is a critical momentum turn.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 10 turns:**\n- Turn 17: UP to (5, 5), continue building momentum\n- Turn 18: Consider UP to (5, 6) or LEFT toward (3, 7) apple\n- Goal: Collect 2-3 more apples in next 10 turns to establish a 6-7 apple lead\n- Monitor enemy: they seem to be clustering around (3, 5-6) area; watch if they move toward my path\n- Avoid getting trapped on the right side; keep left side open for escape routes\n\nUP",

Priority: (3, 9), then (2, 3). Keep monitoring enemy snake at (3, 7) - they could be targeting (3, 9) as well.

There's an apple at (4, 6).\n- This increases my score to 5-5, tying the game immediately.\n- After eating, I grow by 1, and my body shifts - the tail at (6, 3) is removed and I grow instead.\n- Excellent move to recover the deficit.\n- Enemy head is at (3, 9), moving away from this area.\n\n**UP (5, 7):**\n- Safe but moves away from all apples.\n- Doesn't help me recover the scoring deficit.\n- Wastes a turn when I have a clear apple to grab.\n\n**RIGHT (6, 6):**\n- Safe but moves away from all apples.\n- Similar issue to UP - doesn't help me catch up in score.\n\n**Best move analysis:**\n\nLEFT is clearly optimal because:\n1. I immediately collect the apple at (4, 6), tying the score at 5-5.\n2. This is the closest apple to my current position.\n3. Enemy head at (3, 9) is not on a collision course.\n4. I need to recover this 1-apple deficit urgently.\n5. After eating, I'll have grown and can pursue the next apple strategically.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nAfter collecting (4, 6), I should assess the board. The next closest apples are (2, 3) and (2, 1). I need to continue collecting apples aggressively to build a lead since I'm currently behind. Watch enemy snake #1 closely - they have the apple lead and will likely pursue remaining apples. Maintain positioning that prevents head-on collisions while maximizing apple collection.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake at (2, 9) with body stretched down to (3, 5) is a major obstacle. Moving UP to (4, 7) gets me closer to (2, 3) vertically while staying safe. The enemy's vertical position down column 3 makes moving directly left risky right now.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2, 3), I'll be at 6 apples and take the lead.

Safe from all bodies.\n2. **DOWN (5, 7)**: Moving to (5, 7) - this is my own body segment. SUICIDE. FORBIDDEN.\n3. **LEFT (4, 8)**: Moving to (4, 8) - this is my own body segment. SUICIDE. FORBIDDEN.\n4. **RIGHT (6, 8)**: Moving to (6, 8) - safe from all bodies.\n\n**Viable moves:** UP or RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the board, I'm at (5, 8) with good positioning. The enemy is concentrated on the left side (columns 2-3). The apples on the right side are more accessible:\n- (8, 1) and (7, 2) are on the right, relatively close\n- (2, 3) and (2, 1) are on the left, closer to the enemy\n\n**Evaluating viable moves:**\n\n1. **UP (5, 9)**: Takes me to the top edge. From there, I'd need to move LEFT or RIGHT next turn. This boxes me into the top row with limited options.\n\n2. **RIGHT (6, 8)**: Continues eastward, moving toward the apples at (7, 2) and (8, 1). This keeps me flexible:\n   - Next turn from (6, 8), I can go DOWN toward (7, 2) or (8, 1)\n   - I maintain distance from the enemy\n   - I stay away from edges and dangerous corners\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is clearly the better strategic move. It continues my planned eastward path toward the outer apples, maintains flexibility, and keeps me safe from the enemy clustering on the left. The apples at (7, 2) and (8, 1) are less contested and provide a clear path to grow my score.\n\n**Plan for next 3 turns:**\n- Turn 23: RIGHT (5,8)\u2192(6,8) - continue east\n- Turn 24: DOWN (6,8)\u2192(6,7) - start moving toward apple row\n- Turn 25: Continue RIGHT/DOWN toward (7,2) or (8,1)\n\nRIGHT",

It collects an apple immediately, keeps me on track for the planned sequence (8,1) \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 (9,6), and ties my score with the enemy.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:**\nAfter this apple at (8, 1), move RIGHT to (9, 1) for another apple. Then pivot UP toward (9, 6). This sequence gives me two more apples to take the lead. Need to watch for the enemy snake as it moves around the board - currently it's far on the left side but gaining apples. Priority: secure the right-side apple chain quickly.\n\nDOWN",

When you are one step away from that apple, consider moving UP or DOWN to adjust the y\u2011coordinate if needed, but keep the x\u2011position expanding toward the interior of the board.  \n3.

While it might seem like a tight corner, it's actually a safe positioning as I can move LEFT from here to reach (5, 9) next turn.

Once I collect that apple, I'll have a 10-8 lead. Then pivot down to collect (5, 2) which is well-positioned. After securing these two apples, reassess positioning relative to the enemy and decide whether to pursue (7, 1), (2, 3), or (0, 0) based on the enemy's movements.\n\nUP",

Checking board: yes, empty \u2713\n   - Safe move\n   - But enemy head is at (2, 4) moving...\n   - If enemy moves RIGHT, we converge at (3, 4) - no collision\n   - If enemy moves UP to (2, 5) or DOWN to (2, 3), no collision\n   - If enemy moves LEFT to (1, 4), they grab an apple\n   - LEFT moves me closer to apple at (1, 4)\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 4):**\n   - Is (6, 4) clear? Checking board: yes, empty \u2713\n   - Safe move\n   - Moves away from apples\n   - Less strategically sound\n\n**Viable moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLEFT (4, 4):\n- Moves toward apple at (1, 4) - closest apple\n- Enemy at (2, 4) is between me and that apple\n- If I go LEFT, I'm distance 3 from (1, 4)\n- Enemy is distance 1 from (1, 4)\n- Enemy will likely grab (1, 4) this turn or next\n- Puts me in direct competition with enemy for a low-value apple\n- Risk: If I chase, enemy may head-on collide with me or trap me\n\nUP (5, 5):\n- Moves toward the upper apple cluster: (4, 6), (4, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)\n- Avoids direct competition with enemy on row 4\n- Opens multiple paths forward (can continue UP or pivot LEFT)\n- Distance to (4, 6): 2 moves (right-down or down-right)\n- Distance to (4, 7): 1 move LEFT then potentially UP\n- Better positioning away from enemy\n\nRIGHT (6, 4):\n- Moves away from all apples\n- Not strategic given I'm behind by 1 apple\n\n**Decision:**\n\nUP is the superior move because:\n1. It keeps me safe from the enemy head that's closing in on row 4\n2. It positions me to access the cluster of 4 apples in the upper portion of the board\n3. It maintains strategic flexibility for future moves\n4. It avoids competing directly with the enemy for the low-value apple at (1, 4)\n\n**Long-term plan for next 5-10 turns:**\n- UP to (5, 5) this turn\n- Next turn: Move LEFT to (4, 5) to position toward (4, 6) or (4, 7)\n- Focus on collecting the upper apple cluster (4, 6), (4, 7), (2, 7)\n- Monitor enemy position; if they head up, adjust strategy to avoid collision\n- Goal: Get to 16+ apples to take the lead before turn 100\n\nUP",

Move RIGHT this turn to escape the tight formation\n2. Next turn, assess options - likely move DOWN to start heading toward the lower apples\n3. Target the apples at (7, 1) or (5, 1) as they're far from enemy territory\n4. Maintain distance from enemy and avoid getting boxed in again\n\nRIGHT",

Less optimal than eating the apple to the right.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nThe apple at (7, 6) is directly adjacent to my head. Eating it is an obvious choice that:\n1. Increases my score by 1 (16 \u2192 17)\n2. Closes the gap with the enemy (now trailing by 2 instead of 3)\n3. Positions me well to move toward the lower apples at (7, 1) and (5, 1)\n4.

This is a reasonable move - getting closer to an available apple. The apple at (6, 8) is only 1 cell away after this move.\n\n- **DOWN (7, 5):** Moves toward the apples at (7, 1) and (5, 1). These are valuable targets. However, this move takes me away from the nearest apple at (6, 8).\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n\nThe apple at (6, 8) is extremely close - just 1 cell away diagonally from my current position. If I move UP to (7, 7), I'll be adjacent to it. The next turn I can move left to (6, 8) and collect it.\n\nThis is a strong strategy because:\n1. It gets me closer to an apple (6, 8) that I can likely collect next turn\n2. The enemy is at (1, 9), far away in the upper-left corner\n3.

Moving UP keeps me away from the dangerous lower portions where I might get trapped\n\n**Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. Move UP this turn to (7, 7)\n2. Next turn, move LEFT to (6, 8) and collect the apple (18 apples total)\n3. Then reassess from (6, 8):\n   - Move DOWN toward (7, 1) or (5, 1)\n   - Collect those lower apples to catch up further\n4. Continue collecting apples while maintaining distance from enemy\n\nUP",

The apples at (7, 1) and (5, 1) are on the lower part of the board. Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) starts me on the path toward (7, 1) directly below.

The apple at (7, 1) is directly below me and reachable. By moving DOWN, I continue on my planned path to collect it efficiently. This is the most direct route to close the gap.\n\n**Future Plan:**\n- Turn 74: DOWN to (7, 6)\n- Turn 75: DOWN to (7, 5)\n- Turn 76: DOWN to (7, 4)\n- Turn 77: DOWN to (7, 3)\n- Turn 78: DOWN to (7, 2)\n- Turn 79: DOWN to (7, 1) - COLLECT APPLE #19\n- Then reassess board and potentially move to other apples like (5, 1)\n\nDOWN",
