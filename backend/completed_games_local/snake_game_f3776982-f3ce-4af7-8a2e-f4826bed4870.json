So safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n\nAll four moves are within board bounds (0\u20139).  \nNo body segments anywhere yet, so no risk of self-collision.  \nCould any move cause head-on collision with snake #0?  \nSnake #0 at (0, 1) could move UP to (0, 2), DOWN to (0, 0), LEFT off board (dies), RIGHT to (1, 1).  \nNone of my possible moves go to those coordinates except maybe (6, 3), (7, 4), (7, 2), (8, 3) \u2014 all far from (0, 1)\u2019s possible moves. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples nearby:  \n- (6, 4) \u2013 2 steps away (left then up, or up then left).  \n- (5, 2) \u2013 2 steps away (left then down-left, but need to check coordinates). Actually from (7, 3): (5, 2) is dx=-2, dy=-1.  \n- (6, 1) \u2013 dx=-1, dy=-2.  \n- (6, 6) \u2013 dx=-1, dy=+3.  \n- (8, 2) \u2013 dx=+1, dy=-1.  \n- (9, 2) \u2013 dx=+2, dy=-1.  \n- (8, 1) \u2013 dx=+1, dy=-2.  \n- (7, 9) \u2013 far.  \n\nClosest apple by Manhattan distance:  \n(6, 4) \u2192 |7-6| + |3-4| = 1+1=2.  \n(8, 2) \u2192 1+1=2.  \n(5, 2) \u2192 2+1=3.  \n(6, 1) \u2192 1+2=3.  \n\nSo two apples at distance 2: (6, 4) and (8, 2).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose direction toward one of them while keeping options open:**  \nTo (6, 4): need LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.  \nFrom (7, 3):  \n- LEFT to (6, 3) \u2192 then UP to (6, 4) gets apple next turn.  \n- UP to (7, 4) \u2192 then LEFT to (6, 4) gets apple next turn.  \n\nTo (8, 2):  \n- RIGHT to (8, 3) \u2192 then DOWN to (8, 2) gets apple next turn.  \n- DOWN to (7, 2) \u2192 then RIGHT to (8, 2) gets apple next turn.  \n\nAll first moves safe. Which is better?  \n\nCheck future safety after each:  \nIf I go LEFT to (6, 3): next turn from (6, 3) I can go UP to (6, 4) apple, but after eating, my body will be at (6, 3), so from (6, 4) my possible moves: UP to (6, 5) empty, DOWN to (6, 3) body (no), LEFT to (5, 4) empty, RIGHT to (7, 4) empty. That\u2019s 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nIf I go UP to (7, 4): next turn from (7, 4) go LEFT to (6, 4) apple, then body at (7, 4), from (6, 4) moves: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) body \u2014 so 3 safe moves again.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 3): next turn DOWN to (8, 2) apple, then body at (8, 3), from (8, 2) moves: UP (8,3) body, DOWN (8,1) empty, LEFT (7,2) empty, RIGHT (9,2) apple but maybe occupied later? Actually (9,2) is apple now. That\u2019s 3 safe moves (UP blocked by body).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 2): next turn RIGHT to (8, 2) apple, body at (7, 2), from (8, 2) moves: UP (8,3) empty, DOWN (8,1) empty, LEFT (7,2) body, RIGHT (9,2) apple \u2014 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll similar.  \n\nBut consider snake #0\u2019s position: it\u2019s far away at (0,1), so no immediate threat.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick the apple to the left (6, 4) because it\u2019s closer to board center and gives more future space.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (6, 4), consider moving toward center to avoid edges, and watch snake #0\u2019s movement pattern.  \n\n**Move choice:**  \nLEFT",

Better to grow now.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (6, 4), move to open space (UP or RIGHT) to avoid boxing self in, and watch enemy movement pattern.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

The board state shows (9, 0) is an apple, and (8, 1) is an apple. Moving to (6, 1) sets up a high-efficiency path through these points.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMoving UP to (6, 1) takes an apple and positions me to sweep through the bottom-right cluster: (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 2), (8, 2). I will stay along the bottom two rows to keep distance from the opponent.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

It will be far from me (row 1 vs my row 8\u20139).  \n\n**Strategy:**  \nUP eats apple immediately, increases length to 7, but next turn only 2 safe moves (both apples). That\u2019s a bit risky \u2014 if both apples lead to dead ends later, I could get trapped.  \nLEFT or RIGHT keep 3 safe moves next turn and still position me near apples (LEFT toward (3,9), RIGHT toward (8,8)).  \n\nGiven enemy is far and we are tied in apples, I could play safe and not rush into a corner.  \nIf I go UP to (5, 9), next turn I must go LEFT or RIGHT into another apple, which will again limit moves afterward (since eating apples delays tail movement).  \n\nBetter to keep flexibility: choose LEFT or RIGHT now, then eat apples when it doesn\u2019t reduce options too much.  \n\nLEFT (4, 8) gives me access to (4, 9) apple next turn if I want, or I can go DOWN/LEFT to open space.  \nRIGHT (6, 8) gives me access to (6, 9) apple next turn.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick LEFT because it moves toward the cluster of apples at left-top (3,9), (2,9), (1,9) and also toward (4,4) later, while keeping more space away from right wall.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (4, 8), next turn consider going UP to (4, 9) to eat apple if safe, or DOWN/LEFT to maintain space. Enemy is far at bottom, so focus on collecting apples while keeping escape routes. Avoid boxing self in top row after eating too many apples in a row.  \n\nLEFT",

UP leads to apple at (2, 9).  \n\n- **DOWN to (2, 6)**:  \n  From (2, 6): UP (2, 7) \u2014 body, DOWN (2, 5) \u2014 empty, LEFT (1, 6) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (3, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n  Safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).

LEFT leads to apple at (0, 7).  \n\n**Enemy situation:**  \nEnemy is far away (row 2 vs my row 7). It might go RIGHT to (9, 2) for apple, or UP/LEFT to explore.  \n\n**Strategy:**  \nAll three moves are safe now and give at least 2 safe moves next turn.  \nUP gives only 2 safe moves next turn but leads directly to apple at (2, 9) the turn after.  \nDOWN and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn and also lead toward apples.  \n\nI want to avoid getting trapped in the top row after eating apple at (2, 9) \u2014 but that\u2019s next turn\u2019s problem.  \nLEFT to (1, 7) gives flexibility and immediate path to apple at (0, 7) next turn if I choose LEFT again.  \nDOWN to (2, 6) also good, but apples on left side are closer.  \n\nGiven enemy is far and I need to catch up in apples (5 vs 8), I\u2019ll go for nearest apple path: UP to (2, 8) sets up eating (2, 9) next turn, and I still have LEFT as safe move next turn to avoid trap.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (2, 8), next turn I can go UP to (2, 9) to eat apple, then likely only LEFT (1, 9) or DOWN (2, 8) \u2014 but DOWN is my old body then, so only LEFT might be safe unless body moves. Wait \u2014 after eating, my tail stays at (5, 7) until I move, so (2, 8) will be body next turn? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body: head (2, 7) \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 (5, 7).  \nIf I move UP to (2, 8), new body: (2, 8) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 (5, 7) \u2014 length 7 (since I didn\u2019t eat apple). So (2, 7) is now body segment. Next turn from (2, 8), DOWN is (2, 7) which is body \u2192 not safe. So next turn from (2, 8) safe moves: UP to (2, 9) apple, LEFT to (1, 8) empty. That\u2019s 2 safe moves, one leads to apple. Acceptable.  \n\nLet\u2019s pick UP to progress toward apple.  \n\nUP",

UP leads to apple at (1, 9).  \n\n**Enemy situation:**  \nEnemy is far away (row 2 vs my row 8). It might go UP toward (9, 3) or DOWN toward (9, 1). No immediate threat to me.  \n\n**Strategy:**  \nUP gives an apple immediately and sets me at 6 apples (enemy has 9). After eating, I\u2019ll be at (2, 9) with only LEFT and RIGHT as safe moves next turn \u2014 both apples, so I can eat again next turn. That\u2019s good for catching up.  \n\nLEFT gives flexibility (3 safe moves next turn) and also leads toward apples (1, 9) next turn if I choose UP.  \n\nGiven I need apples quickly, UP is tempting. Risk: after eating at (2, 9), I\u2019ll be at top row with only two moves, but both are apples, so I can eat one and then likely have more options after tail moves.  \n\nCheck: If I go UP to (2, 9) and eat, new body: head (2, 9), then (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8). Tail at (5, 8). Next turn if I go LEFT to (1, 9) and eat, length becomes 8, tail still at (5, 8) until I move again. From (1, 9) then: DOWN (1, 8) empty, LEFT (0, 9) apple, RIGHT (2, 9) body. So still options.  \n\nLEFT now is safer long-term but slower apple gain. Since enemy is ahead 9 to 5, I should prioritize apple collection.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to eat (2, 9) now.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 9) after eating, choose LEFT to (1, 9) to eat another apple, unless something changes.  \n\nUP",

Fortunately, this move lands me directly on an apple at (9, 0). After consuming this apple, I will be in the corner.

Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1's head is at (1, 9). It is currently far away and occupying the top-left quadrant. It poses no immediate threat to my position at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**3. Obstacle and Body Check:**\nMy body occupies (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), and (4, 1). \n*   Cell (8, 0) is currently empty.\n*   Cell (7, 0) is currently empty.\n*   Cell (6, 0) is occupied by my body, but that segment is 7 units away from my head. Since I grow when eating an apple, let's check the tail: I just ate an apple at (9, 0), so my body length increased. The tail will stay at (4, 1) this turn. I must be careful heading towards (6, 0) in the coming turns.\n\n**4. Strategy and Reasoning:**\nI am currently in the bottom-right corner (9, 0). The only viable move that does not result in immediate death is **LEFT**.\nMy immediate goal is to navigate out of this corner and away from my own body segments on Row 1. By moving LEFT to (8, 0), I begin a path along the bottom edge where there is more space. \n\n**Future Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 0). From there, I will likely continue LEFT to (7, 0). I need to be cautious as I approach (6, 0), which is currently part of my body. I will monitor the movement of my tail to see when segments clear out. Once I've cleared the bottleneck of my own body, I will target the apples at (9, 4) and (9, 5) or move toward the center clusters.\n\nLEFT",

No, length stays same if no apple eaten, so last segment (4, 8) is removed, tail becomes (3, 8).  \n\nThen from (1, 7) next turn, LEFT to (0, 7) eats apple, then I grow, tail stays at (3, 8), so body length increases by 1.  \n\nThat seems good: get apple next turn while keeping more central position now.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN now, then likely LEFT next turn to eat (0, 7) apple.  \n\nDOWN",

Analyze Potential Moves from Head (7, 0):\n*   **UP:** Moves to (7, 1). **DEATH** (Body segment).\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (7, -1). **DEATH** (Off board).\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (8, 0). **DEATH** (Backwards into body).\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (6, 0). **DEATH** (Body segment).\n\n### 2. Immediate Crisis Assessment:\nWait, my current head is at (7, 0). \nMy body is: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0)].\n*   Check (6, 0): My tail is currently at (5, 0). Since I did not eat an apple last turn, every segment moves forward.\n*   **Current move calculation:**\n    - Head (7, 0) moves to new square.\n    - Tail (5, 0) moves to where (6, 0) was.\n    - The square (6, 0) will be occupied by the body segment that was at (6, 1).\n    - Therefore, (6, 0) will NOT be empty this turn. It will be occupied by the segment transitioning from (6, 1).\n\n**Wait, I am in a trap.** \nLet's re-verify the coordinates:\n- Head: (7, 0)\n- Body:\n  1. (8, 0)\n  2. (9, 0)\n  3. (9, 1)\n  4. (9, 2)\n  5. (8, 2)\n  6. (8, 1)\n  7. (7, 1)\n  8. (6, 1)\n  9. (6, 0)\n  10. (5, 0) (Tail)\n\nThe only move that isn't instantly off-board or backwards (RIGHT) or into a body segment (UP/LEFT) depends on whether the tail moves. \nIf I move **LEFT** to (6, 0), it is currently occupied by the 9th segment. On this turn, that segment moves to (5, 0). \n**Correction:** When a snake moves, the head moves to a new cell *at the same time* as the tail leaves its current cell. All body segments move up the chain.\n- The cell (6, 0) is currently occupied by segment 9. \n- In this move, segment 9 moves to the position of segment 10 (5, 0).\n- Therefore, **(6, 0) becomes vacant** this turn.\n\nHowever, I must check if I can go UP or LEFT.\n- UP (7, 1): Occupied by segment 7. Segment 7 moves to segment 8 (6, 1). Cell (7, 1) becomes vacant.\n- LEFT (6, 0): Occupied by segment 9. Segment 9 moves to (5, 0). Cell (6, 0) becomes vacant.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are actually safe because the tail/body segments occupying them are moving out of those cells this turn, and I did not eat an apple on the previous turn (meaning the snake is not growing/stretching).\n\n### 3. Choosing between LEFT and UP:\nIf I go **UP** to (7, 1):\n- Next turn I'd be at (7, 1). My body would be at (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0)... blocking me.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 0):\n- I continue along the bottom edge. Segment (5, 0) will vacate next turn.\n\nLEFT is the most consistent path to follow my tail out of this self-imposed loop.\n\nLEFT",

It might choose any direction but all kill it. No chance it reaches my head\u2019s possible next positions (1, 6) or (0, 7).  \n\n**Which safe move is safer?**  \n\n- **LEFT to (0, 7)**: eats apple, so I grow by 1. New body length = 9. New head at (0, 7).  \n  After eating apple, tail stays at (3, 8). Body becomes: head (0, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8).  \n\n- **DOWN to (1, 6)**: no apple, so tail moves to (3, 8) removed, new tail (3, 7). Body becomes: head (1, 6), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7).  \n\nBoth are safe this turn.  \n\nBut consider next turn\u2019s safety after each:  \n\nIf I go LEFT and eat apple:  \nFrom (0, 7):  \nUP (0, 8) \u2014 empty (dot).  \nDOWN (0, 6) \u2014 empty.  \nLEFT (-1, 7) \u2014 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (1, 7) \u2014 my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).  \n\nIf I go DOWN (no apple):  \nFrom (1, 6):  \nUP (1, 7) \u2014 my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (1, 5) \u2014 apple (A).  \nLEFT (0, 6) \u2014 empty.  \nRIGHT (2, 6) \u2014 empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nSo DOWN gives more options next turn.  \n\nBut enemy dies this turn, so if I survive this turn, game ends immediately with me as winner. So next turn doesn\u2019t matter.  \n\nThus, both LEFT and DOWN win.  \n\nBut is there any hidden risk this turn?  \nCould enemy\u2019s death cause its body to disappear and free a cell? Not relevant for my move this turn.  \n\nCould there be a head-on collision if enemy moves into my cell? No, too far.  \n\nSo either is fine.  \n\nChoosing DOWN avoids growing, which might be irrelevant since game ends. But maybe game doesn\u2019t end if enemy\u2019s death is simultaneous with my move? Rules: \u201cIf all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\u201d Enemy dies this turn no matter what, so after this turn, all opponents dead \u2192 I win.  \n\nSo I just need to survive.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick DOWN to keep more options in case I\u2019m wrong about immediate win (but I\u2019m not).  \n\n**Plan for next turn (if needed):**  \nFrom (1, 6), go for apple at (1, 5) or (0, 4) etc.  \n\nDOWN",
