Dead.\n\nSafe moves: RIGHT and UP. Both safe. Need to pick one. Apples: (7,4), (9,6), (8,5), (4,9), (6,9). Current distance to (7,4): 7+4=11. To (9,6):9+6=15. To (8,5):8+5=13. To (4,9):4+9=13. To (6,9):6+9=15. From (0,0), both RIGHT and UP are moving away from most apples? Actually moving away? All apples have x>=4. So moving RIGHT (to (1,0)) is closer to (4,9) (distance 3+9=12) than (0,1) (distance 4+8=12). Actually both give same Manhattan distance to (4,9) (from (1,0): 3+9=12, from (0,1):4+8=12). To (7,4) from (1,0):6+4=10, from (0,1):7+3=10. Same. So equal. But we might consider future paths: from (1,0) we can go RIGHT to (2,0) etc, which is moving towards east side apples. From (0,1) we go into column 0, which may be dead end if we go up to y=9? Actually column 0 has no apples and may trap us later. Since board width 10, column 0 is a boundary. From (0,1) we can only go DOWN (back to start) or RIGHT (to (1,1)) or UP to (0,2). That's not too bad. But from (0,0) moving RIGHT opens up more space. Also enemy snake at (4,7). Might not be immediate threat. I'll choose RIGHT to start moving towards the apples.\n\nPlan: Move right toward the east side where apples are clustered. Avoid getting trapped near left edge. Keep options open.\n\nFinal move: RIGHTRIGHT",

While safe now, moving to the edge limits my future options (only 3 directions available from there, and if I go further up the edge, I might get trapped). It is generally safer to stay away from walls early on if possible.\n- **UP** to (1,1) moves vertically. This is a valid move, but all apples have x >= 4. I need to increase my x coordinate to get closer to the apples.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,0) increases my x coordinate, moving me horizontally towards the right side of the board where the apples are clustered (x=4,6,7,8,9). It also keeps me away from the left wall, maximizing my mobility.\n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the best move to close the distance to the apples while maintaining open space.\n\nRIGHT",

The text description \"Head: (3, 0)\" in the current prompt confirms this position.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:**\n    *   Text: Head at (5,9), Body at [(4,9)]. \n    *   Board Visual: Row 9 shows `0` at index 5 and `T` at index 4.\n    *   **Note on Contradiction:** The text lists a Body at (4,9), but the Board Visual shows `T` (Tail) at (4,9). In standard Snake logic, `T` marks the end of the body. The head is at (5,9). The snake is facing or moving towards the apple at (9,6) or is simply positioned there. It is not an immediate threat to me at (3,0).\n\n**Move Evaluation from (3,0)**\nI must choose a move for the turn.\n1.  **LEFT:** Moves to **(2,0)**. \n    *   This cell is empty (last turn it was my head, but I moved away, so it is now safe unless I am moving 2 steps in one turn, which I am not). \n    *   It moves me away from the central apple cluster at (7,4), (8,5), (9,6). \n    *   It moves me towards the wall, reducing future mobility.\n2.  **RIGHT:** Moves to **(4,0)**.\n    *   This is empty.\n    *   It moves me closer to the apples at x=6,7,8,9.\n    *   This maintains the course set in the previous turn's plan.\n3.  **UP:** Moves to **(3,1)**.\n    *   Empty.\n    *   Moves me closer to the apples at y=3,4,5,6.\n    *   Good option.\n4.  **DOWN:** Moves to **(3,-1)**.\n    *   Out of bounds (y < 0).\n    *   **DEAD.**\n\n**Decision**\nI need to reach the apples at (7,4), (8,5), (9,6). \nMoving **RIGHT** to (4,0) is the most direct path to the x-coordinates of these apples (7,8,9). \nMoving **UP** would work, but the prompt's historical context (\"Turn: 3\") and the previous \"RIGHT\" move suggest a momentum towards the right side of the board is intended.\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the best move to close the distance to the target apple cluster.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving towards the right side to intercept the central apple cluster at (7,4), (8,5), (9,6). Once at a higher y-coordinate, evaluate the path around Snake #0.\n\nRIGHT",

Yes.\n    *   Is it inside a snake body?\n        *   My body: Empty.\n        *   Snake #0: Empty.\n    *   Is it backwards? Vector to (7,1) is (0, 1). Previous vector was (1, 0) (RIGHT). Not backwards.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, -1):**\n    *   Is it on the board? No.\n    *   **Result: UNSAFE (Wall).**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 0):**\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it inside a snake body?\n        *   My body: (6, 0) is my previous head position. Moving back kills me.\n    *   Is it backwards? Vector (-1, 0), previous (1, 0). Yes.\n    *   **Result: UNSAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 0):**\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it inside a snake body?\n        *   My body: Empty.\n        *   Snake #0: Empty.\n    *   Is it backwards? Vector (1, 0). Previous (1, 0). Not backwards.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\nSo I have two safe moves: UP to (7,1) and RIGHT to (8,0).\n\n**Strategy:**\n*   I am at (7,0). Enemy #0 is at (7,7).\n*   If I go UP to (7,1), I am directly below the enemy on the same vertical line. This is risky. If the enemy goes DOWN (to (7,6) or further), I could eventually face a head-on collision if we meet. However, the board is wide.\n*   If I go RIGHT to (8,0), I move off the vertical axis of the enemy. I am still close to the apple cluster at (7,4), (8,5), (9,6).\n*   Moving RIGHT keeps me closer to the cluster (specifically the apple at (8,5)) and avoids the potential vertical conflict with Snake #0 for now.\n*   Moving UP clears the vertical line but moves me away from the (8,5) apple. (7,1) is currently empty, and I can then navigate towards the cluster.\n*   Let's look at the apples: (7,4), (9,6), (8,5), (2,3), (1,5).\n*   From (7,0), the path to (7,4) is clear vertically (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). The path to (8,5) involves moving right eventually.\n*   If I go UP, I am setting up to go to (7,4). If I go RIGHT, I am setting up to go to (8,5).\n*   The enemy is at (7,7). They are a long way away. A direct head-on collision is unlikely in the immediate future unless we both rush the same spot.\n*   However, staying on the wall (x=0 or x=9) is usually safer. I am currently at x=7. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to x=9 (the right wall).\n*   Let's look at the board state again.\n    *   Row 0: ` . . . . . . . 1 . ` (I am at 7).\n    *   Row 4: ` . . . . . . . A . ` (Apple at 7,4).\n    *   Row 5: ` . A . . . . . . A . ` (Apples at 1,5 and 8,5).\n    *   Row 6: ` . . . . . . . . . A ` (Apple at 9,6).\n*   If I go UP to (7,1), I can continue up to (7,2), (7,3), (7,4) to eat the apple. This is a straight line.\n*   If I go RIGHT to (8,0), I can go UP to (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) to eat the apple. Also a straight line.\n*   The apple at (7,4) is closer in Manhattan distance from (7,0) (4 moves) than (8,5) from (8,0) (5 moves) or (7,0) to (8,5) (6 moves).\n*   However, the enemy is on the x=7 line. If I go UP, I am entering the \"domain\" of the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN, we might meet.\n*   BUT, looking at the board, the enemy is surrounded by its own body. It is at (7,7), body at (7,8), (7,9). It has very limited mobility. It cannot go UP or LEFT/RIGHT easily. It likely has to go DOWN.\n*   If the enemy goes DOWN, it will be at (7,6). I will be at (7,1). We are far apart. It will take the enemy 5 turns to reach me (7,6 -> 7,5 -> 7,4 -> 7,3 -> 7,2 -> 7,1). By then, I will have eaten the apple at (7,4) and moved on.\n*   So, UP seems viable.\n*   Why RIGHT? To get closer to the wall? I am at x=7. The wall is at 9. That's 2 steps away. I am at y=0. The wall is at 0. That's 0 steps.\n*   If I go UP, I am moving away from the bottom wall. If I go RIGHT, I am moving towards the right wall.\n*   Let's reconsider the \"Safe Moves\" logic. \"Favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\".\n    *   If I am at (7,1): I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is backwards).\n    *   If I am at (8,0): I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is wall).\n    *   Both are good.\n*   Let's look at the other apples: (2,3), (1,5). These are on the far left. The cluster (7,4), (8,5), (9,6) is on the top-right. I am bottom-left-center. I should focus on the nearest cluster. The (7,4) apple is the closest Manhattan distance from my current head (7,0).\n*   If I go UP, I am on the path to (7,4).\n*   If I go RIGHT, I am not on the direct path to (7,4), but I am on the path to (8,5).\n*   Let's check if (7,4) is safe.\n    *   Enemy is at (7,7). If it goes DOWN every turn: (7,6), (7,5), (7,4).\n    *   I go UP: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n    *   We would arrive at (7,4) at the same time?\n        *   Me: 4 turns.\n        *   Enemy: 3 turns.\n    *   So the enemy would reach (7,4) before me.\n    *   If the enemy reaches (7,4) on Turn 10 (7+3), and I reach it on Turn 11 (7+4), I die.\n    *   However, the enemy might not go straight down. It has apples at (8,5) and (9,6). It might turn right.\n    *   The enemy is at (7,7). Its body is at (7,8) and (7,9). It cannot go UP. It can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n    *   Going LEFT is wall (6,7)? No, x=6 is valid.\n    *   Going RIGHT is (8,7).\n    *   Going DOWN is (7,6).\n    *   If the enemy goes for (8,5) or (9,6), it will move RIGHT or DOWN-RIGHT.\n    *   If the enemy moves right, it is no longer on the x=7 line.\n    *   So, if I go UP to (7,1), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7), the vertical conflict is resolved.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN, I am safer moving RIGHT to (8,0).\n*   Let's look at the board: Enemy at (7,7). To get to (8,5), it needs to go (7,7)->(8,7)->(8,6)->(8,5). That's 3 moves. To get to (9,6), it needs to go (7,7)->(8,7)->(9,7)->(9,6). That's 3 moves.\n*   I am at (7,0). To get to (7,4), 4 moves. To get to (8,5), 6 moves.\n*   The enemy is likely to move towards its food. The food is at (8,5) and (9,6). Both require it to leave the x=7 line eventually.\n*   If the enemy leaves the x=7 line, then going UP to (7,1) is perfectly safe and leads directly to the apple at (7,4).\n*   If the enemy stays on x=7 (goes DOWN), it risks trapping itself against me or the wall. But it has to move.\n*   Given that I am at the bottom and the enemy is at the top, and there is food at (7,4), it is reasonable for me to claim that column. I will move UP.\n*   If I move RIGHT, I am deviating from the closest apple.\n*   Decision: Move UP. It is the most direct route to the closest apple (7,4). The enemy is likely to move laterally (RIGHT) to get to its own food (8,5/9,6), which clears the vertical line.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 0):** Empty (previous position, but I moved UP, so this is safe as it is not \"backwards\" relative to my current vector UP). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Enemy Situation:** Snake #0 is at (7, 6). It is blocked from going UP by its own tail at (7, 8). Its most likely moves are DOWN (towards me), LEFT (to 6,6), or RIGHT (to 8,6). Given that there are apples at (8, 5) and (9, 6), it is highly probable that Snake #0 will move RIGHT to pursue those points.\n    *   **Apple Clusters:**\n        *   **Cluster A (Right):** (8, 5), (9, 6), (7, 4). This is the densest cluster and closest to me.\n        *   **Cluster B (Left):** (1, 5), (2, 3). Further away.\n    *   **Trajectory:**\n        *   If I move **UP**, I stay on the x=7 axis. If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, I maintain a safe distance. If Snake #0 moves DOWN, we are on a collision course if we keep moving towards each other. However, (7, 2) is safe this turn.\n        *   If I move **LEFT**, I diverge from the right-side apple cluster.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT**, I align myself with the apple at (8, 5) and move away from the potential vertical conflict with Snake #0. This is a safer, more offensive play.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    Moving **RIGHT** is the best move. It positions me at (8, 1), putting me on a direct path to the apple at (8, 5) (via (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)). It also shifts me away from the x=7 column, which Snake #0 occupies, reducing the chance of a head-on collision if Snake #0 moves DOWN. Moving UP is also safe, but moving RIGHT commits to the closer and denser apple cluster without crossing the enemy's likely path.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove Right towards the (8,5) and (9,6) apples. Avoid the vertical line of the enemy at x=7. Once the right cluster is cleared, consider moving towards the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

It keeps x=7 clear of me.\n        *   **UP to (8, 2):** This is a safe move towards the target cluster.\n        *   **DOWN to (8, 0):** This moves away from apples.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    **RIGHT** is the best move.\n    It continues the trajectory established in the previous turn (Turn 8: moved RIGHT to (8,1)).\n    It maximizes the distance from Snake #0's current column (x=7).\n    It keeps me on the path to the (8,5) apple (via (9,2), (9,3)... or (8,2)...).\n    Moving LEFT risks entanglement with Snake #0.\n    Moving UP is safe but less aligned with the \"avoid x=7\" strategy.\n    Moving RIGHT is the safest and most strategic offensive move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving Right and Up to intercept the apple cluster at (8,5) and (9,6). Avoid the vertical line x=7 where the enemy snake resides.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

It keeps me on the right edge, away from the enemy. However, if the enemy moves UP twice, it could reach (8, 6) and potentially trap me if I go all the way up to (9, 6).\n        *   **LEFT to (8, 2):** This moves towards the (8, 5) apple.

If the enemy moves UP to (8,5), I will be at (9,3). I will still be safe.\n    Consider the enemy at (8,4). It wants (8,5). If I go LEFT to (8,2), I am moving closer to the enemy's target. If I go UP, I stay on my own path. The enemy cannot block me at (9,6) because I am closer to it (3 steps away vs 4+ for enemy) and on a parallel path.\n    Specifically, if the enemy moves UP to (8,5), it eats an apple. That is fine. I continue UP.\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9,4), it would be a head-on collision if I go UP to (9,3)? No, (9,4) vs (9,3). It would be adjacent. But enemy prefers (8,5).\n    Therefore, **UP** is safe and maintains the plan.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP along the right edge to collect (9, 6).

However, the Board State clearly shows \"1\" at (9, 3). I will trust the Board State as the current reality.\n*   **Turn:** 12 / 150.\n*   **Enemy #0:** Head (8, 5), Body: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)]. Apples: 4.\n    *   Enemy just moved from (8, 4) to (8, 5). This is an **Apple EAT**. The user rationale predicted this. Since Snake #0 ate an apple, it will **grow**. Its tail will **remain** at (7, 6) this turn. The cell (8, 4) becomes the new second segment, and (8, 5) is the head.\n*   **My Goal:** Eat (9, 6). This is 3 squares away (steps: (9,4) -> (9,5) -> (9,6)).\n\n**Safety & Collision Analysis:**\n1.  **My Potential Moves from (9, 3):**\n    *   **UP to (9, 4):** On board.

Dead.\n\n2.  **Enemy #0 Prediction:**\n    *   From (8, 5), the enemy is in a column of apples (8, 5 eaten, 8, 6 is an apple in the Board State at row 6). The enemy has a chain of apples in column 8: (8, 5) just eaten, (8, 3) is an apple.\n    *   However, the most obvious path for a snake that just ate is to continue towards the next closest apple.\n    *   **Option A (Likely): UP to (8, 6).** This is an apple. It keeps the snake moving up the column. It grows, so its tail stays at (7, 6).\n    *   **Option B (Possible): DOWN to (8, 4).** Returns to previous position, clearing the space. (8, 5) becomes body.\n    *   **Option C (Aggressive): RIGHT to (9, 5).** This intercepts *my* path to (9, 6) and grabs the apple at (9, 6) or (9, 5). (Note: (9, 5) is empty in the map, (9, 6) is an apple).\n    *   **Option D (Backward/Left): LEFT to (7, 5).** Blocked by its own body at (7, 5) [Wait, body is (7,4),(7,5),(7,6)]. (7, 5) is occupied. So LEFT is blocked.\n\n3.  **Specific Collisions to Avoid:**\n    *   If I go **UP to (9, 4)**:\n        *   If Enemy goes **RIGHT to (9, 5)**: We are adjacent at (9,4) and (9,5). No head-on collision, but we are adjacent. If Enemy continues RIGHT next turn, we die.\n        *   If Enemy goes **UP to (8, 6)**: We are at (9,4) and Enemy (8,6). Safe distance.\n    *   If I go **LEFT to (8, 3)**:\n        *   Enemy is at (8, 5). Distance is 2.\n        *   If Enemy goes **DOWN to (8, 4)**: Enemy at (8,4), Me at (8,3). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy goes **UP to (8, 6)**: Safe.\n        *   Risk: Moving into the same column as the enemy is dangerous if they turn left later.\n    *   If I go **DOWN to (9, 2)**:\n        *   Moves away from (9, 6). This is undesirable for winning.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n*   I need to reach (9, 6). The safest route is staying on the edge (x=9).\n*   If I go **LEFT**, I enter the center where the enemy is dominant.\n*   If I go **UP**, I am 1 step closer to (9, 6). The enemy is likely to eat upwards at (8, 6).\n*   Is **UP** blocked by the enemy? The enemy is at (8, 5). To block (9, 4), the enemy must move RIGHT. If the enemy moves RIGHT, it misses the apple at (8, 6). While possible (aggression), the enemy has a clear apple path straight up in column 8. Therefore, it is more likely to go UP.\n*   Even if the enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 5), we are safe this turn at (9, 4). We just have to watch out next turn.\n*   Going **LEFT** puts me directly below the enemy's potential path (if it goes down next turn) or adjacent to it. It reduces my maneuvering space.\n*   Therefore, **UP** is the best move to secure the (9, 6) apple safely.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP towards (9, 6). Watch for Enemy moving RIGHT. If Enemy moves RIGHT, prepare to turn LEFT or DOWN to avoid it, but for now, the path is clear.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

Body: [].\n*   **Turn:** 13 / 150.\n*   **Enemy #0:** Head was (9, 5), Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\n    *   *Correction from User Prompt:* The prompt claims the enemy head is at (9, 5), but the Board State clearly shows \"0\" at (9, 5) AND \"T\" at (9, 5) (meaning Tail). Furthermore, (8, 5) contains an \"A\" (Apple).\n    *   Given the Board State is the definitive source of truth, I will trust the Board State.\n    *   **Scenario A (Board State is literal):** Enemy Head at (9, 5). Enemy Body: ...? (8, 5) is an Apple, so the body likely ends there or connects differently than listed. (7, 5) is \"T\" (Tail). This implies a very short body or the prompt data is corrupt. However, the prompt explicitly lists `Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]`. If (8, 5) is an Apple, the body data is inconsistent.\n    *   **Scenario B (Prompt Body is correct):** If the body is `[(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]`, then (8, 5) is occupied. (9, 5) is the Head.\n    *   **Scenario C (Head moved):** The prompt says \"Turn: 13\". If the enemy ate at (9, 5) in turn 12, it grew. If it moves this turn (13), it will leave its tail at (7, 5) only if it eats again. If it doesn't eat, the tail moves to (8, 5).\n    *   **Most Likely Enemy Move:** The enemy is at (9, 5). There is an apple at (9, 6). The enemy is right next to it. The enemy will almost certainly move **UP** to (9, 6) to eat the apple. If it does, it grows, and its tail stays at (7, 5) (or wherever the tail was before the move, likely (8, 5) based on the prompt body list).\n    *   **Safety Check for ME:**\n        *   I am at (9, 4).\n        *   **UP to (9, 5):** The enemy is currently at (9, 5). If I move UP, I move into the enemy's head. This is a head-on collision if the enemy stays, or I move into a cell occupied by the enemy if it moves. **DEAD.**\n        *   **LEFT to (8, 4):** The prompt says Enemy Body is `[(8, 5), (8, 4), ...]`. So (8, 4) is occupied. **DEAD.**\n        *   **DOWN to (9, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n\n*   **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I must avoid the enemy. The enemy is at (9, 5) and likely going UP to (9, 6).\n    *   I cannot go UP (collision/wall of enemy).\n    *   I cannot go LEFT (into enemy body).\n    *   I cannot go RIGHT (wall).\n    *   I must go **DOWN** to (9, 3) to survive.\n    *   Moving DOWN moves me away from the apple at (9, 6), but survival is the priority. Once safe at (9, 3), I can re-evaluate for the apples at (8, 3) or (9, 6) in subsequent turns (though (9, 6) will likely be eaten by the enemy this turn).\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    Move DOWN to (9, 3) to avoid the enemy at (9, 5) and the enemy body at (8, 4). Survive this turn.\n\nDOWN",

Length 1 (head) + 5 body segments = 6 segments. 5 apples = length 6. Correct. If it eats this turn, it stays length 6 because the tail doesn't move. If it doesn't eat, it becomes length 5. Wait, standard snake rules: length = 1 + apples. So if it has 5 apples, length is 6. 1 head + 5 body. The board shows 5 body segments. So it is currently length 6. It has not grown this turn.)\r\n*   **Apples:** (2, 3), (1, 5), (3, 2), (7, 1), (0, 2).\r\n*   **Immediate Threats & Safety Checks (from Head (6, 3)):**\r\n    *   **UP (6, 4):** Empty.

Safe (Apple at (3, 2) is two steps away, (7, 1) is diagonal/away, (2, 3) is close). Actually (2, 3) is to the left. (6, 2) is safe. Note: There is an apple at (0,2) which is far left on y=2. (6,2) is clear. An apple is at (3,2) but that's 3 steps left, not immediate adjacency. Wait, checking map: Row 2 is \"A . . A . . . . . .\" (0,2), (3,2) are apples. (6,2) is at x=6, so empty. Correct. (7,1) is apple, but that's down-left diagonal from (6,3) to (7,2) to (7,1). (7,2) is empty. So (6,2) is safe.).\r\n    *   **LEFT (5, 3):** Empty. Safe. Moves towards apple at (2, 3) and (0, 2). *Wait, check collision with Enemy #0.* Enemy #0 Head is at (6, 6). It could potentially move DOWN to (6, 5), then (6, 4), etc. If I move LEFT to (5, 3), I am safe from collision with a DOWN moving enemy. If Enemy moves DOWN, I am at (5,3), they are at (6,5). Distance is good. If Enemy moves LEFT (to 5,6), safe. If Enemy moves RIGHT (to 7,6), safe. If Enemy moves UP (to 6,7), safe. I am at y=3, Enemy at y=6. I am safe from immediate head-on collision with Enemy #0 unless Enemy makes a long run at me, which is unlikely in one turn. *However*, if Enemy moves DOWN and I move UP, we might be on a collision course for the center. Staying low or moving left avoids that. *Correction on Safety Check*: The prompt says \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\". Since I have no body, I only care about my head hitting their body or their head hitting my head. My head (6,3). Enemy body is mostly right of x=6, and y=6. Enemy could move DOWN to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). If I stay at (6,3), and Enemy moves DOWN to (6,3), we collide. I die. If I move LEFT to (5,3), and Enemy moves DOWN to (6,3), I live. If Enemy moves DOWN and lands on (5,3), I die. But Enemy is at (6,6), needs to go DOWN 3 steps to get to (6,3). It moves 1 step. So it lands at (6,5) or (5,6) or (7,6) or (6,7). I am safe from immediate collision with Enemy #0 at (5,3). *Moving UP to (6,4)* is also safe from immediate collision. *Moving DOWN to (6,2)* is safe. *Moving RIGHT to (7,3)* is safe (back to where I came from? No, I was at (7,3) then moved LEFT to (6,3). So (7,3) is empty. Wait, the board state in the prompt says \"3 . . A . . . 1 . . .\" (at turn 16). Then I moved LEFT. So current state is Head (6,3). If I move RIGHT, I go back to (7,3). Is (7,3) occupied? The board shows 1 at (6,3) now? No, the board is static snapshot of turn 16. The body of the enemy is at (7,6)... So (7,3) is empty. However, moving RIGHT moves me away from the majority of apples (which are at x<6). So RIGHT is bad strategically, but safe.)\r\n*   **Strategic Opportunity:**\r\n    *   **Distance to Apples:**\r\n        *   (2, 3): 4 steps Left. (Distance 4 Manhattan).\r\n        *   (0, 2): 6 steps Left, 1 Down. (Distance 7).\r\n        *   (7, 1): 1 Down, 1 Right. (Distance 2). Note: (7, 1) is at x=7, y=1. From (6,3): Down to (6,2), then Right to (7,2), then Down to (7,1). 3 steps. Wait, (7,1) is apple. From (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (7,2) -> (7,1). 3 steps. From (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1). 3 steps. (7,1) is close. *Correction*: (7,1) is at (7,1). (6,3) is at (6,3). The difference is +1 x, -2 y. That is distance 3. (2,3) is at -4 x, 0 y. Distance 4. So (7,1) is closer. However, (2,3) is on the same Y line as me. Moving LEFT keeps me on Y=3. Moving DOWN takes me to Y=2. (7,1) is at Y=1. To get to (7,1) safely, I have to go through (6,2) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) OR (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1). The path is clear. But (2,3) is also clear. The board is mostly empty. However, Snake #0 is at (6,6). If I go for (7,1), I am on the right side of the board near the enemy. If I go LEFT, I get away from the enemy and head towards the \"safe\" apples (2,3), (1,5), (0,2). The apples on the right (7,1) is \"bait\" in the enemy's territory. It is risky to go there because the enemy might want it too, or if it turns down, it cuts me off. If the enemy turns down, it will likely go for apples on the right. Let's look at the enemy. It is at (6,6). The nearest apple for it is... none directly near. It might be hunting me or trying to reach the center. If I go LEFT, I gain territory. If I go DOWN, I can pivot to LEFT or go to (7,1). But going DOWN exposes me to a collision if the enemy decides to turn down. But the enemy is far away. The best long term strategy is to claim the left side of the board. The apple at (2,3) is 4 steps away. The apple at (7,1) is 3 steps away but in contested territory. Let's go for (2,3). To get there, I must move LEFT. If I move DOWN, I waste a turn moving away from (2,3). If I move UP, I go into the center. (6,4) is safe for now, but brings me closer to the enemy. Moving LEFT is the best of both worlds: it moves me towards an apple and increases distance from the enemy. *Wait*, check (7,1) path. From (6,3) to (6,2) to (7,2) to (7,1). If I move DOWN to (6,2), I am one step closer to (7,1). However, if I move LEFT to (5,3), I am one step closer to (2,3). (2,3) gives me 1 point. (7,1) gives me 1 point. Both are single apples. The *clusters* are: Left side has (2,3), (1,5), (0,2) (3 apples). Right side has only (7,1). The enemy is on the right. I should take the left side. Moving LEFT commits to the left side. Moving DOWN keeps options open (can go Left or Right). However, moving DOWN puts me on Y=2, where there are apples at (0,2) and (3,2). (3,2) is closer to (2,3) than (7,1) is. Actually, if I go DOWN to (6,2), I can pivot LEFT to (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) (Apple). That's a good path. But if I go LEFT to (5,3), I can pivot DOWN to (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2). Both paths converge. The deciding factor is the enemy. The enemy is at (6,6). If I move LEFT, I am at (5,3). If the enemy moves DOWN (to 6,5), we are separated. If I move DOWN (to 6,2), and enemy moves DOWN (to 6,5), we are still separated. However, if I move LEFT, I am moving towards the wall. If I move DOWN, I stay central. But (6,3) is already central. Moving LEFT gives me the left flank. The enemy is on the right. I should take the left. Let's check the specific board state. Row 3: \". . A . . . 1 . . .\" (apples at 2,3 and 6,3). Row 2: \"A . . A . . . . . .\" (apples at 0,2 and 3,2). Row 5: \". A . . . . . . T T\" (apple at 1,5). Row 1: \". . . . . . . A . .\" (apple at 7,1). My head is at (6,3). Moving LEFT to (5,3) puts me in empty space. Moving DOWN to (6,2) puts me in empty space. Moving UP to (6,4) puts me in empty space. Moving RIGHT to (7,3) puts me in empty space. There are no immediate body obstacles for me. The only danger is the enemy moving into me. The enemy is at (6,6). It can move to (6,5), (5,6), (7,6), (6,7). None of these are my current position (6,3) or my next position (5,3), (6,2), (6,4), (7,3). I am safe from collision this turn. The only other snake is #0. So all moves are safe. Which is best? (7,1) is a single apple on the right. (2,3) is a single apple on the left, leading to a cluster. (3,2) is a single apple on the left/low. (1,5) is far. (0,2) is far. The closest apples are (7,1) (dist 3) and (2,3) (dist 4). (7,1) is slightly closer. But it's on the right. The enemy is on the right. If I go for (7,1), I am in the enemy's face. If I go for (2,3), I am claiming territory. However, the board is 10x10. The enemy is at (6,6). I am at (6,3). That's 3 units away. If I move LEFT, I am at (5,3). Distance to enemy is sqrt((5-6)^2 + (3-6)^2) = 1 + 9 = 10. If I move DOWN, (6,2). Distance sqrt(0 + 16) = 4. If I move UP, (6,4). Distance sqrt(0 + 4) = 2. If I move RIGHT, (7,3). Distance sqrt(1 + 9) = 10. Moving UP reduces distance to 2. That is risky. Moving DOWN reduces distance to 4. Moving LEFT/RIGHT keeps distance at 10. So LEFT/RIGHT are safest regarding distance. Between LEFT and RIGHT: LEFT leads to a cluster of 3 apples. RIGHT leads to 1 apple. So LEFT is better. What about DOWN? It's in between. It keeps distance 4. If I move DOWN, I can still go LEFT. If I move LEFT, I can still go DOWN. But moving LEFT immediately grabs \"territory\" and moves towards the cluster. I will choose LEFT. *Double check*: Last move was LEFT. So I am at (6,3) having moved from (7,3). My tail would be at (7,3) if I had one. I don't have one. So I have free movement. I will move LEFT to (5,3). This starts the run towards (2,3). It also avoids the potential \"down rush\" from the enemy if it decides to hunt the (7,1) apple. If the enemy rushes down, it might land on (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). I will be at (5,3). I am safe. If the enemy rushes left, it goes to (5,6). I am safe. If the enemy rushes up, it goes to (6,7). I am safe. If the enemy rushes right, it goes to (7,6). I am safe. LEFT is the most versatile and strategic move. It leads to the (2,3) apple, which is the start of the left-side cluster. It avoids the wall (right side). It maintains distance from the enemy. It does not move backwards (which would be RIGHT, back to 7,3). Moving DOWN is okay but less directed. Moving UP is closer to enemy. LEFT wins. *Wait, checking apple at (3,2)*. From (5,3), next move could be (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2). Or (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2). Both are good. From (6,2), next move (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2). Also good. But (6,2) is on y=2, which has an apple at (0,2) and (3,2). Row 2 is \"A . . A . . . . . .\" Wait, the map says row 2: \"A . . A . . . . . .\" That's (0,2) and (3,2). (7,2) is empty. (6,2) is empty. (5,2) is empty. (4,2) is empty. (3,2) is apple. So moving DOWN to (6,2) puts me on the row with apples. But the apples are at x=0 and x=3. I am at x=6. So I have to move LEFT anyway. If I move LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3), I am at x=5, y=3. The apple at (3,2) is at x=3, y=2. I need to go LEFT 2 and DOWN 1. From (6,2), I need to go LEFT 3 and DOWN 0 (but I'm already down). Actually from (6,2) to (3,2) is 3 LEFT. From (5,3) to (3,2) is 2 LEFT, 1 DOWN. Both are distance 3. From (5,3) to (2,3) is 3 LEFT. From (6,2) to (2,3) is 4 LEFT, 1 UP. So (2,3) is closer from (5,3). (3,2) is same distance. (7,1) is further from (5,3) than from (6,3). So (5,3) is a pivot point for the left cluster. (6,2) is a pivot point for the bottom row. The left cluster has 3 apples. The bottom row has 2 apples (0,2 and 3,2) but (2,3) is just above (3,2) and (1,5) is above (0,2). The left side is denser. I should go LEFT. *Wait, last move rationale said \"LEFT\"*. I should be consistent. The last rationale was \"LEFT\" because it moves towards (2,3). I agree. The path is clear. I will go LEFT. I will turn off the \"Think out loud\" chain now and commit to the move. The prompt asks for the final line to be just the word. I will output LEFT. I need to include the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" block as requested. I will write the rationale explaining why LEFT is better than DOWN (which is the main competitor given UP is risky and RIGHT is bad). I will highlight the apple cluster argument and the distance to enemy argument. I will keep it concise. Final check: If I move LEFT, I go to (5,3). Is there any trap? No. I am safe. I am one step closer to (2,3). I am far from the enemy. This is the correct move. I will write the rationale now.\n**Strategy Note:** Secure the left side. The cluster of apples at (2,3), (1,5), and (0,2) is worth more than the isolated apple at (7,1). Moving LEFT immediately claims territory and distances you from the enemy on the right. Avoid moving DOWN towards the enemy's potential path.\nLEFT",

It has grown significantly recently and has its body piled up just below it. It is very likely to move DOWN to (1, 6) or further to reclaim space and clear its tail, or potentially push towards the apple at (1, 5).\n\nBecause of this threat, moving UP to (1, 3) is extremely risky. Even though (1, 3) is currently empty, if snake #0 moves down to (1, 6), it will compress its body, potentially moving into (1, 5) or (1, 4) in future turns. Being directly underneath a large, aggressive enemy is a bad position.\n\nI am at (1, 2). My tail is at (0, 3), and my body goes through (0, 2).\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 2) is safe (my own tail is there, but the head moves into it, and the tail moves away). However, this returns me to where I was last turn, which is stalling.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 1) is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (7, 1) while moving away from the enemy.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) is safe and moves towards the apple at (3, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN or RIGHT are both good options to create distance from the enemy. Moving DOWN to (1, 1) takes me to the row with an apple at (7, 1). This seems like a good long-term objective.\n\nLet's double check safety.\nMy body: Head (1,2), (0,2), (0,3).\nNeighbors:\n- UP (1,3): Empty. But risky due to enemy above.\n- DOWN (1,1): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (0,2): Currently my body, but it's the tail. Tail will move. Safe.\n- RIGHT (2,2): Empty. Safe.\n\nConsidering the enemy at (1,7) with body extending down to (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), etc., they are poised to move down. If I go UP, I might run right into them or get trapped. If I go DOWN, I am definitely safer and can pivot left or right later.\n\nThe apple at (7,1) is a good target. Moving DOWN gets me closer to it.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove DOWN to (1, 1) to distance myself from the enemy snake #0 which is looming above. From (1, 1), I can navigate towards the apple at (7, 1) or pivot towards (3, 2) if the path clears. Watch enemy #0's movement to ensure they aren't dropping down aggressively.\n\nDOWN",

It also keeps me away from the bottom edge, maintaining maximum flexibility.\n\nBetween the safe moves, **RIGHT** is the only one that makes progress towards the apple at (7, 1) and maintains better board position (center/right rather than edge).\n\n**Strategy Plan:**\nTarget the apple at (7, 1). Avoid the edges where movement is restricted. Keep an eye on Snake #0, but it is currently distant. The apple at (3, 2) is also a potential pivot if the path to (7, 1) opens up.\n\nRIGHT",

Checking the board state: (2, 2) contains 'T' (enemy snake #0's tail). The description confirms the enemy body is `[(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6)]`. This body is far away (y=7+). The 'T' on the board at (2, 2) appears to be a mismatch with the coordinates or a visual artifact in the text representation, but based on the provided snake data, (2, 2) is empty. Let's re-verify the board.\n    Board row 2: `2 . T . A . . . . . .`\n    Let's look at the enemy snake #0 again.\n    Snake #0: Head (3, 7), Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6)].\n    The 'T's on the board: Row 7 has T T T... Row 6 has T T...\n    This matches the enemy body coordinates in the text description.\n    However, the \"Board state\" text shows a 'T' at (2, 2). Let's look at the enemy snake coordinates again: `(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6)`.\n    None of these are (2, 2).\n    Let's look at my *own* body. My body is `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`. Wait, the description says \"Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]\". The head is at (2, 1).\n    So (1, 1) and (1, 2) are my body.\n    The board shows 'T' at (2, 2). This is likely a representation error in the board text where 'T' is used for Enemy Snake #0, but the specific coordinate (2, 2) is not occupied by Enemy #0.\n    Wait, looking at the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section:\n    Head: (2, 1)\n    Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]\n    Wait, if the head is (2, 1) and the body is (1, 1) and (1, 2), that's a \"L\" shape (down-left and up-left).\n    Wait, the rule says: \"snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2)]\".\n    If Head is (2, 1), then (1, 1) is the segment behind it. Then (1, 2) is the next segment.\n    This connects. (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2).\n    So (2, 2) is currently empty.\n    \n    So **UP to (2, 2) is SAFE**.\n\n2.  **DOWN**: Target (2, 0).\n    Board row 0: `0 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    (2, 0) is empty. **Safe**.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (1, 1).\n    This is my own body segment. **Unsafe**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target (3, 1).\n    Board row 1: `1 . T 1 . . . . A .`\n    (3, 1) is empty (represented by '.'). **Safe**.\n\nSummary of Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy:**\n-   Target apple at (7, 1) or (7, 5).\n-   Moving RIGHT moves closer to (7, 1) (x=3 vs x=2).\n-   Moving UP moves closer to apple at (6, 8) or (7, 5), but starts moving me away from (7, 1).\n-   Moving DOWN puts me at (2, 0). This is close to (7, 1) in X, but on the edge. It limits future moves.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to continue progressing along the bottom row towards the apples at (7, 1) and (7, 5), as suggested by my previous turn's logic. This keeps options open.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake #0 is at (2, 5) and is very long, wrapping around the bottom-left corner.\n\n*   **UP (Target: (3, 4)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Based on the current board state, (3, 4) is empty (the 'A' is at (0,4), not (3,4)).\n    *   **Collision Check:** No obstacles immediately visible.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n*   **DOWN (Target: (3, 2)):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** My body is currently at (3, 2). Moving down is suicide.\n    *   **Result:** **Unsafe**.\n\n*   **LEFT (Target: (2, 3)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:** No obstacles.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: (4, 3)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:** No obstacles.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**2. Decision:**\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n*   **Strategy:** The enemy snake #0 is located at (2, 5) with a long tail stretching down to (1, 7) and wrapping near (2, 1). This occupies the bottom-left quadrant. Moving **LEFT** towards (2, 3) brings me closer to this \"danger zone\" and potential traffic. Moving **RIGHT** or **UP** moves me away from the enemy.\n*   **Apples:** The nearest apples are at (0, 4) (far left) and (1, 5) (also left/center). However, pursuing these immediately would require navigating near or through the path of Snake #0. There is an apple at (7, 1) to the right, but it is somewhat far. An apple at (6, 8) is straight up.\n*   **Safety & Future Options:** Moving **UP** is the most versatile. It opens up the top half of the board, keeps me away from the enemy cluster, and avoids the \"wall\" of my own tail which is currently blocking DOWN. It also aligns me with the apple at (6, 8).\n*   **Simultaneous Movement:** Snake #0 is currently facing... looking at its tail (3,5) next to head (2,5), it seems it might be moving Right or Up. It's hard to predict, but keeping distance is key.\n\nMoving **UP** is the safest bet to open up the board and get away from the immediate danger of the bottom-left corner.\n\n**START STRATEGY NOTE**\nFocus on clearing the bottom-left quadrant to avoid Snake #0. Head towards the center or top-right where apples like (7,5) and (6,8) are, or loop around to the top-left for (0,4) once the enemy moves away.\n**END STRATEGY NOTE**\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

Moving UP takes us closer to the enemy's head at (0,5) and the apple at (0,4).\"\n  Wait, the rationale in the prompt says \"Moving UP takes us closer to the enemy's head at (0,5) and the apple at (0,4)\".\n  My current position is (5,4).\n  Moving UP puts me at (5,5).\n  Enemy is at (0,4).\n  (0,5) is the enemy's body.\n  Distance from (5,5) to (0,5) is 5. Distance from (5,4) to (0,4) is 5.\n  Moving UP doesn't actually change the distance to the enemy's head (which is at (0,4)). It changes the distance to the enemy's neck (0,5).\n  The rationale in the prompt claimed \"Moving UP... takes us closer to the enemy's head\". This is factually incorrect regarding Manhattan distance to (0,4). (5,4) -> (0,4) is 5. (5,5) -> (0,4) is 6.\n  So the previous rationale was flawed in stating UP brings us closer to the enemy.\n  \n  Let's correct the logic.\n  Target: (7,5).\n  Current: (5,4).\n  Manhattan distance: |7-5| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n  \n  Option A: RIGHT to (6,4).\n  New distance to (7,5): |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n  \n  Option B: UP to (5,5).\n  New distance to (7,5): |7-5| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n  \n  Option C: DOWN to (5,3).\n  New distance to (7,5): |7-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n  \n  So UP and RIGHT are equally good for (7,5).\n  \n  What about (6,8)?\n  Option A (6,4): Distance to (6,8) = 4.\n  Option B (5,5): Distance to (6,8) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n  \n  What about (7,1)?\n  Option A (6,4): Distance = 1 + 3 = 4.\n  Option B (5,5): Distance = 2 + 4 = 6.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT, I am closer to (7,1).\n  If I go UP, I am closer to (6,8).\n  \n  Which is better?\n  (7,1) is a straight shot down/right.\n  (6,8) is up.\n  \n  Let's look at the board for traps.\n  Row 4: (6,4) is empty.\n  Row 5: (6,5) is empty.\n  Row 4: (7,4) is empty.\n  \n  Let's check the area around (5,5).\n  Row 5: (5,5) is empty.\n  Row 6: (5,6) is empty.\n  Row 5: (4,5) is empty.\n  Row 5: (6,5) is empty.\n  \n  Let's check the area around (6,4).\n  Row 4: (6,4) is empty.\n  Row 4: (7,4) is empty.\n  Row 5: (6,5) is empty.\n  Row 3: (6,3) is empty.\n  \n  Both seem open.\n  \n  Is there any reason to turn away from the enemy?\n  The enemy is on the left.\n  Moving RIGHT moves away from the enemy.\n  Moving UP moves perpendicular to the enemy.\n  \n  Moving RIGHT is safer in terms of \"don't go near the enemy\".\n  \n  Let's check the apple at (0,0) and (0,4). These are near the enemy.\n  I should not go for those.\n  \n  So I should go for (7,5), (7,1), (6,8).\n  \n  Let's check the board state again.\n  Row 2: `. . . . . . . . .

Let's trace the body movement.\n  Head moves to (6,4).\n  Old head (5,4) becomes segment 1.\n  Old segment 1 (4,4) becomes segment 2.\n  Old segment 2 (3,4) becomes segment 3.\n  Old segment 3 (3,3) is removed (tail moves).\n  So the new body is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].\n  \n  If I move UP to (5,5):\n  New body: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)].\n  Same body segments.\n  \n  So both moves result in the same new body configuration (except the head position).\n  New body will be (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  This occupies the line y=4 from x=3 to x=5.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT to (6,4):\n  Head at (6,4).\n  Body at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  Next turn I can go to (7,4), (6,5), (6,3).\n  (7,4) is open.\n  (6,5) is open.\n  (6,3) is open.\n  (5,4) is blocked by my body.\n  \n  If I go UP to (5,5):\n  Head at (5,5).\n  Body at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  Next turn I can go to (5,6), (6,5), (4,5).\n  (5,6) is open.\n  (6,5) is open.\n  (4,5) is open.\n  (5,4) is blocked by my body.\n  \n  Both seem fine.\n  \n  Let's check the \"Last Move\" info.\n  Last move was RIGHT.\n  I was at (4,4) and moved to (5,4).\n  \n  Current head (5,4).\n  \n  Let's look at the apple (6,8).\n  To get there, I need to go UP.\n  (6,8) is at y=8.\n  (5,4) is at y=4.\n  If I go UP, I get to y=5.\n  \n  Let's look at the apple (7,5).\n  To get there, I need to go RIGHT/UP.\n  \n  Let's look at the apple (7,1).\n  To get there, I need to go DOWN/RIGHT.\n  \n  The board is open.\n  The enemy is far away.\n  The enemy has 7 apples. I have 3.\n  I need to catch up.\n  The apples on the right are (7,5), (7,1), (9,2), (6,8).\n  \n  (7,5) is closest.\n  (6,8) is close.\n  (7,1) is close.\n  (9,2) is further.\n  \n  Let's consider the geometry of the right side.\n  Row 5: `. . . . . . .

(0,4) is an apple.\n  Wait, (0,4) is an apple?\n  Prompt: \"Apples at: ... (0, 0), ...\"\n  No, (0,4) is not an apple.\n  \n  The enemy is at (0,4). The board shows `0` at (0,4).\n  The apple at (0,0) is at the bottom left.\n  The enemy is on the 4th row.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT:\n  I secure space on the right.\n  If I go UP:\n  I secure space on the top-right.\n  \n  The apple at (6,8) is top-right.\n  The apple at (7,5) is mid-right.\n  \n  Let's try to be safe.\n  If I go RIGHT, I can see (7,4), (6,5), (6,3).\n  If I go UP, I can see (5,6), (6,5), (4,5).\n  \n  Is there any trap?\n  Let's check if I can get boxed in.\n  If I go RIGHT to (6,4):\n  My body is (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  If the enemy moves to (3,5) (it can't, body is there), (2,5)...\n  If the enemy moves to (1,4), (1,5), (1,3).\n  \n  If I go UP to (5,5):\n  My body is (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  \n  Let's look at the \"Last Rationale\".\n  It says \"Comparing UP (y=5) and RIGHT (x=5): Moving RIGHT puts us directly on the path to the cluster of apples on the right side.\"\n  Actually, both are on the path.\n  \n  Let's look at the board state again.\n  Row 4: `(0,4)` is `0` (Enemy).\n  Row 4: `(1,4)` is `.`.\n  Row 4: `(2,4)` is `.`.\n  Row 4: `(3,4)` is `T` (My body).\n  Row 4: `(4,4)` is `T` (My body).\n  Row 4: `(5,4)` is `1` (Me).\n  \n  If I move RIGHT to (6,4):\n  Row 4 becomes: `(6,4)` is `1`.\n  \n  If I move UP to (5,5):\n  Row 5 becomes: `(5,5)` is `1`.\n  \n  Let's check the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" - RIGHT.\n  I moved RIGHT to get to (5,4).\n  \n  Let's look at the snake #0 again.\n  Head: (0,4).\n  Body: (0,5) ...\n  So the snake is pointing UP.\n  \n  I should avoid the enemy.\n  Moving RIGHT increases distance from the enemy (x-distance 5 -> 6).\n  Moving UP keeps distance same (x=5) but changes y.\n  \n  The enemy is at (0,4).\n  If I move RIGHT, I am at (6,4). Distance 6.\n  If I move UP, I am at (5,5). Distance 5.\n  \n  Wait, distance from (0,4) to (5,5) is |0-5| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n  Distance from (0,4) to (6,4) is |0-6| + |4-4| = 6 + 0 = 6.\n  \n  Both are the same distance.\n  \n  However, if the enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), the distance to (6,4) becomes 5. To (5,5) becomes 5.\n  \n  What if the enemy moves UP to (0,5)?\n  Distance to (6,4) is 6 + 1 = 7.\n  Distance to (5,5) is 5 + 0 = 5.\n  \n  If the enemy moves UP, (5,5) is closer.\n  If the enemy moves RIGHT, (6,4) is closer (but both equal).\n  \n  Since the enemy is pointing UP (Head (0,4), Body (0,5)), it is likely to move UP.\n  If it moves UP, it goes to (0,5).\n  \n  If the enemy moves UP to (0,5):\n  It is moving away from the left side wall and deeper into the board.\n  This is good for me. It moves away from the edge.\n  \n  If I move RIGHT to (6,4):\n  I am moving away from the enemy.\n  This is good.\n  \n  Let's consider the apples again.\n  (7,5) is the target.\n  If I go RIGHT (6,4), I can go UP to (6,5) next. Then RIGHT to (7,5).\n  If I go UP (5,5), I can go RIGHT to (6,5). Then RIGHT to (7,5).\n  \n  If I go RIGHT:\n  My path: (5,4) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (7,5).\n  If I go UP:\n  My path: (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5).\n  \n  Is there any difference?\n  If I go RIGHT, I am on row 4.\n  If I go UP, I am on row 5.\n  \n  Row 4 has my body at (3,4), (4,4).\n  Row 5 has the apple at (7,5).\n  \n  If I go RIGHT, I keep my head on row 4, which is cleaner (body is on row 4).\n  If I go UP, I move my head to row 5, leaving the body on row 4.\n  \n  Let's check the \"Turn: 33 / 150\".\n  Game is not near end.\n  \n  Let's check the \"Scores\".\n  Snake #0: 7 apples.\n  Me: 3 apples.\n  \n  I need to eat apples fast.\n  (7,5) is the closest.\n  \n  Let's assume the worst case.\n  I move RIGHT. Enemy moves UP.\n  I am at (6,4). Enemy at (0,5).\n  Next turn, I go to (6,5). Enemy can go to (0,6) or (1,5).\n  (1,5) is occupied by enemy body.\n  So enemy must go UP to (0,6).\n  Then I go to (7,5) and eat the apple.\n  \n  If I move UP. Enemy moves UP.\n  I am at (5,5). Enemy at (0,5).\n  Next turn, I go to (6,5). Enemy can go to (0,6).\n  Then I go to (7,5).\n  \n  Both seem to work.\n  \n  Is there any difference in safety?\n  If I go UP, I am at (5,5).\n  My body is (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  What if an enemy (hypothetical) appears at (5,3)?\n  (5,3) is empty.\n  \n  What if I go RIGHT to (6,4)?\n  My body is (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).\n  \n  Let's look at the board again.\n  Row 4: `. . . T T 1 . . . .`\n  Row 5: `T T T T . . . A . .`\n  \n  If I go UP to (5,5):\n  I am entering row 5, which is mostly empty except for the apple at (7,5).\n  The only danger on row 5 is the enemy at (0,4) -> (0,5).\n  \n  If I go RIGHT to (6,4):\n  I am staying on row 4.\n  Row 4 is empty at (6,4).\n  \n  Let's check the space availability.\n  If I go RIGHT, I have room to go UP or RIGHT or DOWN next.\n  If I go UP, I have room to go RIGHT or UP or LEFT next.\n  \n  Let's check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again.\n  It said \"Comparing UP (y=5) and RIGHT (x=5): Moving RIGHT puts us directly on the path to the cluster of apples on the right side. Moving UP takes us closer to the enemy's head at (0,5) and the apple at (0,4).\"\n  The conclusion was RIGHT.\n  \n  The reasoning \"Moving UP takes us closer to the enemy's head\" was technically wrong (distance increases to 6 from 5), but the conclusion \"RIGHT is optimal to secure space and approach safer apples\" seems sound.\n  \n  However, let's re-verify the distance to (0,4).\n  (5,4) to (0,4) is 5.\n  (6,4) to (0,4) is 6.\n  (5,5) to (0,4) is 6.\n  \n  So both RIGHT and UP increase distance to the enemy.\n  \n  Let's consider the apple at (0,4).\n  The prompt says \"Apples at: ... (0, 0) ...\"\n  The board shows `0` at (0,4).\n  The board shows `A` at (0,0).\n  \n  So (0,4) is NOT an apple. It's the enemy snake head.\n  \n  So the \"Last Rationale\" was confused about the apple locations.\n  \n  Let's correct the strategy.\n  Apples are: (7,1), (7,5), (6,8), (0,0), (9,2).\n  Closest: (7,5).\n  Next closest: (6,8), (7,1).\n  \n  Target: (7,5).\n  \n  To get to (7,5) from (5,4):\n  Manhattan distance 3.\n  \n  Move RIGHT:\n  Current (5,4) -> (6,4).\n  Distance to (7,5) = |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n  \n  Move UP:\n  Current (5,4) -> (5,5).\n  Distance to (7,5) = |7-5| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n  \n  Tie.\n  \n  Let's look at the apple at (6,8).\n  Move RIGHT: (6,4). Distance to (6,8) = 4.\n  Move UP: (5,5). Distance to (6,8) = 4.\n  \n  Apple at (7,1).\n  Move RIGHT: (6,4). Distance = 4.\n  Move UP: (5,5). Distance = 6.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT, I am closer to (7,1).\n  If I go UP, I am equal distance to (7,5) and (6,8), but further from (7,1).\n  \n  Apple at (9,2).\n  Move RIGHT: (6,4). Distance = 6.\n  Move UP: (5,5). Distance = 6.\n  \n  So going RIGHT gives me access to (7,5) AND (7,1).\n  Going UP gives me access to (7,5) AND (6,8).\n  \n  (7,5) is the closest. Let's just go there.\n  \n  Let's look at the board for traps.\n  If I go RIGHT to (6,4):\n  Next moves:\n  (7,4): `.` (Row 4: `1` at 6, `.` at 7).\n  (6,5): `.` (Row 5: `.` at 6).\n  (6,3): `.` (Row 3: `.` at 6).\n  \n  If I go UP to (5,5):\n  Next moves:\n  (6,5): `.`.\n  (5,6): `.`.\n  (4,5): `.` (Row 5: `.` at 4).\n  \n  Both are safe.\n  \n  Let's check the \"HEAD-TO-HEAD\" collision logic.\n  If I move to (6,4) and enemy moves to (1,4), nothing happens.\n  If I move to (5,5) and enemy moves to (1,5), nothing happens.\n  \n  What if the enemy moves to (1,4) and I move to (5,4)? No, I am moving away.\n  \n  Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\".\n  It suggested RIGHT.\n  It incorrectly stated (0,4) is an apple.\n  But the conclusion to go right to avoid the enemy (who is on the left) is valid.\n  \n  Is there any reason to go UP?\n  If I go UP, I can maybe pivot to (6,8).\n  If I go RIGHT, I can pivot to (7,1).\n  \n  With 3 apples vs 7 apples, I need points.\n  (7,1) is an apple.\n  (6,8) is an apple.\n  Both are valid.\n  \n  Let's stick to the safest path.\n  The \"Last Rationale\" said: \"Moving RIGHT puts us directly on the path to the cluster of apples on the right side.\"\n  This is true.\n  \n  Let's double check the board coordinates.\n  Board is 10x10 (0-9).\n  Head is (5,4).\n  \n  Let's verify the body segments.\n  Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n  Board shows:\n  Row 4: `(4,4)` is `T`. `(3,4)` is `T`.\n  Row 3: `(3,3)` is `T`.\n  This matches.\n  \n  Let's verify enemy.\n  Head (0,4). Body (0,5), (1,5)...\n  Board Row 4: `(0,4)` is `0`.\n  Board Row 5: `(0,5)` is `T`.\n  This matches.\n  \n  I will choose RIGHT.\n  \n  Why not UP?\n  If I go UP, I am moving to y=5.\n  The enemy is at y=4.\n  The enemy might move to y=5 (UP).\n  If the enemy moves UP to (0,5), and I move UP to (5,5), we are both on row 5.\n  But we are far apart.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT, I stay on row 4.\n  The enemy might move UP to (0,5) (row 5).\n  Then we are on different rows.\n  \n  If I go RIGHT, I am further away from the enemy's potential path (if he goes UP).\n  If I go UP, I am on the same row (y=5) as the enemy might be (if he goes UP to 0,5).\n  \n  The enemy is at (0,4).\n  If the enemy moves UP, he goes to (0,5).\n  If I move UP, I go to (5,5).\n  If I move RIGHT, I go to (6,4).\n  \n  The enemy is trapped on the left side.\n  I am on the right.\n  I should focus on the right side apples.\n  \n  The \"Last Rationale\" concluded with RIGHT.\n  I will trust that, but correct the factual error about (0,4) being an apple.\n  \n  Move: RIGHT.\n  \n  Long-term plan:\n  Get the apple at (7,5) in 2 turns. Then pivot to (7,1) or (9,2) or (6,8). Avoid the left side. Stay safe.\n  \n  Wait, I should write the plan in the output.\n  \n  Output format:\n  [Rationale]\n  [Plan]\n  RIGHT\n  \n  Rationale:\n  My head is at (5,4). The enemy is at (0,4).\n  The closest apple is at (7,5) (Distance 3).\n  Safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. (LEFT hits my body).\n  UP and RIGHT both reduce distance to (7,5) to 2.\n  Moving RIGHT puts me on (6,4). Moving UP puts me on (5,5).\n  Moving RIGHT increases x-distance from the enemy.\n  Moving UP keeps x-distance same but might align y-distance if enemy moves UP.\n  The board is open to the right.\n  I will move RIGHT to secure space and approach the apple at (7,5).\n  \n  Plan:\n  Next turn I will attempt to move to (6,5) or (7,4) to get closer to the apple at (7,5). I will avoid the left side where the enemy is located.\n  \n  Wait, the prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n  \n  So I need to write:\n  [My Rationale]\n  [My Plan]\n  RIGHT\n  \n  Rationale:\n  Current position: (5,4). Snake #0 is at (0,4).\n  Apples are at (7,1), (7,5), (6,8), (0,0), (9,2).\n  Target: (7,5) (Distance 3).\n  Safe moves: UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), RIGHT (6,4). LEFT (4,4) is unsafe (body).\n  UP and RIGHT both move closer to (7,5).\n  Moving RIGHT (6,4) moves away from the enemy on the left side.\n  Moving UP (5,5) moves onto row 5, which is open but closer to the enemy's potential path if he moves UP.\n  Therefore, RIGHT is the safest and most direct path to the right-side apples.\n  \n  Plan:\n  Secure the right flank. Move towards (7,5) to gain a point. Avoid the left side. After eating (7,5), target (7,1) or (6,8).\n  \n  Right.\n  \n  Wait, I should just write the plan in the \"START RATIONALE\" style?\n  \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt implies I should write the current rationale, not the future plan?\n  Ah, \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n  This means I write the plan NOW, and NEXT turn I will see it as \"Last Rationale\".\n  \n  So the structure is:\n  [Current Rationale (explaining this move)]\n  [Plan for next turn (saved for next turn)]\n  MOVE\n  \n  But the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n  \n  So:\n  [Explanation of why I am moving RIGHT]\n  [Note to self about future moves]\n  RIGHT\n  \n  Let's stick to the immediate logic.\n  I am at (5,4).\n  Enemy is at (0,4).\n  Apples are (7,5), etc.\n  Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n  RIGHT is best to move away from enemy and towards (7,5).\n  \n  Plan:\n  Follow the path to (7,5). Be aware of the enemy. Keep distance.\n  \n  I'll just output the move and the thinking.\n  \n  Wait, the prompt asks me to \"think out loud and explain your reasoning\". Then \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\". Then \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\n  \n  So I will write my reasoning, then the plan, then the move.\n  \n  Reasoning:\n  I am at (5,4). My body is at (4,4), (3,4), (3,3).\n  Enemy is at (0,4).\n  Apples: (7,5) is closest (dist 3).\n  Left (4,4) is body. Unsafe.\n  Down (5,3) is safe but moves away from (7,5).\n  Up (5,5) is safe, moves closer to (7,5).\n  Right (6,4) is safe, moves closer to (7,5).\n  Up and Right are tied for distance to (7,5).\n  However, Right moves further away from the enemy on the left.\n  Up moves onto row 5, which might intersect with enemy if he moves UP.\n  The board is open on the right.\n  Right is the move.\n  \n  Plan:\n  Next turn, move towards (7,5).\n  \n  Move: RIGHT.\n  \n  One word final line: RIGHT.\n  \n  Double check enemy movement.\n  If enemy moves UP to (0,5):\n  I am at (6,4).\n  If enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4):\n  I am at (6,4).\n  \n  If I move UP to (5,5):\n  If enemy moves UP to (0,5):\n  We are at y=5.\n  \n  If I move RIGHT:\n  I am at y=4. Enemy (if UP) is at y=5.\n  \n  If I move UP:\n  I am at y=5. Enemy (if UP) is at y=5.\n  \n  Being on different rows (RIGHT) feels safer than being on same row (UP) if the enemy might be moving into that row.\n  \n  Okay, I'm confident in RIGHT.\n  \n  Final check:\n  Head (5,4).\n  Right (6,4) is empty.\n  Left (4,4) is body.\n  Up (5,5) is empty.\n  Down (5,3) is empty.\n  \n  I will move RIGHT.\n  \n  Wait, I need to check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again.\n  It says \"Moving UP takes us closer to the enemy's head at (0,5) and the apple at (0,4)\".\n  This is wrong. (0,4) is NOT an apple. (0,4) is the enemy head.\n  I must ignore the specific apple logic in the last turn, but the conclusion to go RIGHT was correct.\n  \n  I will write my own reasoning.\n  \n  Reasoning:\n  My head is at (5,4).\n  Enemy snake #0 is at (0,4).\n  Apples are at (7,1), (7,5), (6,8), (0,0), (9,2).\n  I need to collect apples to catch up (3 vs 7).\n  The closest apple is (7,5) (Manhattan distance 3).\n  Possible moves:\n  - LEFT (4,4): Hits my body. Unsafe.\n  - DOWN (5,3): Safe, but moves away from (7,5) and towards the bottom edge. Less optimal.\n  - UP (5,5): Safe. Moves closer to (7,5).\n  - RIGHT (6,4): Safe. Moves closer to (7,5).\n  Comparing UP and RIGHT:\n  Both reduce distance to (7,5) to 2.\n  Moving RIGHT increases x-distance from the enemy (0,4).\n  Moving UP keeps x-distance same.\n  The enemy is likely to move UP (based on neck at (0,5)).\n  If the enemy moves UP, moving RIGHT keeps me on row 4 while enemy moves to row 5.\n  If I move UP, I move to row 5, potentially aligning with the enemy's path.\n  Therefore, RIGHT is safer and equally efficient.\n  \n  Plan:\n  Continue moving towards the right side apples. Target (7,5). Maintain distance from the left side enemy.\n  \n  RIGHT.\n  \n  Wait, I should not mention \"Right\" in the plan text?\n  \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n  This applies to the final line.\n  The \"Plan\" section is part of the rationale, not the final move.\n  \n  Final line must be just \"RIGHT\".\n  \n  I'll assemble the response.\n  \n  [Rationale]\n  [Plan]\n  RIGHT.\n  \n  (Note to self: Make sure the final line is exactly \"RIGHT\").\n  \n  One more check on the board.\n  Row 7: `. . T T . . . . . .`\n  This is the enemy tail? No, prompt says Snake #0 Body: `... (2, 7), ...`\n  So (2,7) and (3,7) are body.\n  Row 6: `. . . T . . . . . .` (3,6) is body.\n  Row 5: `T T T T . . . A . .` (0,5) to (3,5) is body.\n  Row 4: `0 . . T T 1 . . . .` (0,4) is head.\n  \n  The enemy occupies x=0..3 for rows 4..7 (mostly).\n  The right side is completely open.\n  Moving RIGHT is definitely the correct choice to claim space and hunt the apples.\n  \n  Okay, ready.\n  One last check on coordinates.\n  (5,4) -> Right is (6,4).\n  (5,4) -> Up is (5,5).\n  Both are empty.\n  \n  I will output the rationale and plan.\n  The prompt asks to \"think out loud\".\n  \n  My plan will be: \"Secure the right side. Approach the apple at (7,5). Maintain safety.\"\n  \n  Final line: RIGHT.**My Position & Threats:**\nI am at (5,4). My body occupies (4,4), (3,4), and (3,3).\nSnake #0 is at (0,4) on the far left.\nMoving LEFT (4,4) hits my own body, so it is a suicidal move.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP (5,5):** Safe. Moves closer to the apple at (7,5).\n*   **DOWN (5,3):** Safe. Moves away from the main apple cluster.\n*   **RIGHT (6,4):** Safe. Moves closer to the apple at (7,5) and increases distance from the enemy.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe closest apple is at (7,5) (distance 3). Both UP and RIGHT reduce this distance to 2. However, moving RIGHT places me further from the enemy on the left side and keeps my head on the cleaner row 4, whereas moving UP enters row 5. Therefore, RIGHT is the optimal move to secure space and approach the apple safely.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFocus on the apples on the right side of the board ((7,5), (7,1), (6,8)). Avoid the left side where the enemy is located. After securing (7,5), pivot to the next nearest apple on the right flank.\n\nRIGHT",

Moves closer to the apple at (7,5) and increases distance from the enemy.\n\nStrategy:\nThe closest apple is at (7,5) (distance 3). Both UP and RIGHT reduce this distance to 2. However, moving RIGHT places me further from the enemy on the left side and keeps my head on the cleaner row 4, whereas moving UP enters row 5. Therefore, RIGHT is the optimal move to secure space and approach the apple safely.\n\nLong-term Plan:\nFocus on the apples on the right side of the board ((7,5), (7,1), (6,8)). Avoid the left side where the enemy is located. After securing (7,5), pivot to the next nearest apple on the right flank.\n\nRIGHT",

(8, 4) is empty. However, looking at the board state, there is a 'T' (Tail) at (8, 4)? No, the board shows `5 T T T T . . . T 1 .`. The 'T' at (8, 4) represents my own body (specifically the segment at (7, 4) is adjacent to (8, 4)? No, wait. Let's check my body list: `[(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]`. The segment at (7, 4) is there. The board shows `4 T . . . . T T T . .`. The T's are at x=0, x=5, x=6, x=7. The board is 10x10, so x indices 0-9. The T at x=8 on row 4 does not match my body list `[(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]`. Wait, the board shows `T T T T` on row 5 (x=0,1,2,3). Row 4 shows `T . . . . T T T`. The T at x=0 is enemy. The T's at x=5,6,7 are my body `(5,4), (6,4), (7,4)`. There is NO T at x=8 on row 4. So (8, 4) is empty.\n    *   Wait, let me re-read the board.\n       `5 T T T T . . . T 1 .`\n       `4 T . . . . T T T . .`\n       The '1' is at (9, 5). The T at (8, 5) is my head. The T's at (0-3, 5) are enemy. The T at (7, 5) is my body.\n       On row 4: T at (0,4) (enemy). T's at (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) (my body). No T at (8,4).\n    *   So (8, 4) is NOT blocked by my body.\n    *   Is (8, 4) blocked by Enemy #0? Enemy #0 is at x=0-3 on y=0-5. (8, 4) is far away. Safe from enemy body.\n    *   Is (8, 4) blocked by a wall? No, y=4 is valid.\n    *   So DOWN to (8, 4) is technically safe *this turn*.\n    *   However, I must check \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\". My head is at (8, 5). My body connects to (7, 5). If I go LEFT to (7, 5), I hit my body. If I go DOWN, it's not backwards. Backwards would be LEFT. So DOWN is valid.\n    *   Wait, let me check the board again for the '1'. The '1' is at (9, 5). My head is at (8, 5). The board says `5 ... T 1 .` (x=7,8,9). So (9,5) is the '1'. My head (8,5) is the 'T' just left of the '1'. Correct.\n    *   So moves:\n        *   UP (8,6): Empty.\n        *   DOWN (8,4): Empty.\n        *   LEFT (7,5): This is my body segment `(7, 5)`. **DEATH**.\n        *   RIGHT (9,5): This is the edge of the board? No, x=9 is valid. Wait, is it a wall? Board is 10x10 (0-9). (9,5) is valid. Is there anything there? The board shows `1` at (9,5)? No, the '1' is the snake ID. The cell (9,5) is currently occupied by my head? No, my head is at (8,5). So (9,5) is empty.\n        *   Wait, the board shows `5 T T T T . . . T 1 .`. The '1' is at the end. This implies the snake is at (9,5). But the input says `Head: (8, 5)`. There is a discrepancy between the text state and the visual board.\n        *   Let's trust the text state: `Head: (8, 5)`.\n        *   Visual board row 5: `5 T T T T . . . T 1 .`\n            *   `T` at x=0,1,2,3 (Enemy)\n            *   `.` at x=4\n            *   `.` at x=5\n            *   `.` at x=6\n            *   `T` at x=7 (My body `(7,5)`)\n            *   `1` at x=8 (My head `(8,5)`)\n            *   `.` at x=9\n        *   Okay, the visual board representation is slightly compressed or misaligned with the text coordinates. The text explicitly states `Head: (8, 5)`. The body is `[(7, 5), ...]`.\n        *   So (8,5) is the head.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** to (7,5) hits my body.\n        *   Moving **UP** to (8,6): Check board row 6. `6 A . . . . . . . .`. (8,6) is empty. Safe.\n        *   Moving **DOWN** to (8,4): Check board row 4. `4 T . . . . T T T . .`. The T's are at x=5,6,7 (my body). (8,4) is `.`. Safe.\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** to (9,5): Check board row 5. `.` at x=9. Safe.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (8, 6)**: Goes towards Apple at (6, 8). Opens up the top of the board. Potential to trap against wall if I keep going up, but (8,6) is fine. Next moves: (8,7), (9,6), (7,6). (7,6) connects back to (7,5) which is my body, so (7,6) is risky if I don't grow. (8,7) is safer.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 4)**: Goes towards Apple at (7, 1) and (9, 2). Opens up the bottom right. (9,2) is an apple. (8,4) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2). This seems like a clear path to (9,2).\n        *   Path check:\n            *   (9,4): Board row 4 has T's at 5,6,7. (9,4) is `.`.\n            *   (9,3): Board row 3 is all `.`.\n            *   (9,2): Board row 2 has 'A' at (9,2). Perfect.\n        *   However, I need to check for collisions with the enemy. Enemy #0 is at (0,0) with a long tail trailing up. They are moving. Where will they go? They have 8 apples, likely aggressive. But they are far left. They won't reach right side quickly.\n        *   Moving DOWN also keeps me away from the wall (x=9). If I go UP and then RIGHT, I hit the wall.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 5)**: Moves to the edge. Next moves are limited to (9,6), (9,4), (8,5) (backwards).\n        *   (9,6): Board row 6 is empty.\n        *   (9,4): Board row 4 is empty.\n        *   (8,5): This will be my tail if I don't eat an apple. If I go RIGHT now, my tail moves from (5,4) to (6,4)? No, wait. My body is `[(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]`.\n        *   If I move to (9,5):\n            *   New Head: (9,5)\n            *   New Body: [(8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4)]\n            *   The tail (5,4) is removed.\n            *   So (8,5) becomes the new body segment.\n            *   Next turn, going back LEFT to (8,5) would be moving into my own body.\n        *   (9,5) is close to (9,2). Path: (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2).\n        *   (9,5) is also close to (6,8)? No, that's far.\n        *   (9,5) is on the edge. Being on the edge limits maneuverability. \"Keep future options open\".\n    *   **Comparison of DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n        *   Both are on the right side.\n        *   (9,5) is the extreme edge. (8,4) is one step in from the edge.\n        *   (8,4) allows moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n        *   (9,5) allows moves: DOWN, LEFT, UP. (Right is wall).\n        *   (8,4) is strictly better for keeping options open.\n        *   Target (9,2) is straight down from (9,5) and (8,4) is close to that path.\n        *   Target (7,1) is left-down.\n    *   **Risky Move?** What if I go UP? (8,6).\n        *   From (8,6) I can go to (6,8) which is an apple.\n        *   (8,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (6,8).\n        *   (7,6) is adjacent to my body at (7,5). If I don't eat an apple before hitting (7,6), I die.\n        *   Apples are at (6,8) (distance 2.8 sqrt) and (9,2) (distance 3.6 sqrt).\n        *   To get to (6,8) from (8,5): (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). That's 5 moves.\n        *   To get to (9,2) from (8,5): (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2). That's 4 moves. Or (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2). 4 moves.\n        *   Actually, from (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) is 4 moves. That is faster and safer than the path to (6,8).\n        *   Also, moving UP puts me at y=6. Enemy #0 is at y=0-5. They might move up into the center. If I am at (8,6) and they move to (3,5) -> (4,5), etc., I am safe. But if I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy.\n\n    *   **Decision:** DOWN to (8, 4) is the safest and most strategic move. It creates a safe path to (9, 2) apple without trapping myself against the wall immediately. It also moves me closer to (7, 1). UP is safer than usual because of the empty space, but being on the right side is currently advantageous as the enemy is far left.\n\n    *   **Correction:** Let's re-verify `LEFT` is death.\n        *   Head (8,5). Body starts at (7,5). Yes.\n    *   **Re-verify `DOWN` safety.**\n        *   (8,4). Body parts: (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4). No match. Safe.\n    *   **Re-verify `RIGHT` safety.**\n        *   (9,5). Body parts: No match. Safe.\n    *   **Re-verify `UP` safety.**\n        *   (8,6). Body parts: No match. Safe.\n\n    *   **Strategy Refinement:**\n        *   I am at (8,5).\n        *   Enemy #0 is at (0,0).\n        *   I have 4 apples, Enemy has 8.\n        *   I need to catch up.\n        *   The apple at (9,2) is the closest \"safe\" apple. (6,8) is also close, but requires navigating near my body.\n        *   If I go DOWN, I secure a path to (9,2).\n        *   If I go UP, I head towards (6,8), but I have to pass through (7,6) which is dangerous. (7,6) is adjacent to (7,5) (my body).\n        *   If I go UP, (8,6), then (7,6) is the next step. If I eat an apple before (7,6), I am safe. But (7,6) is 2 moves away. The nearest apple is (6,8) which is 3 moves away from (7,6).\n        *   So going UP requires careful planning.\n        *   Going DOWN to (8,4) opens up a clear right side.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's check the enemy.**\n        *   Enemy #0 is at (0,0). Body stretches to (3,5).\n        *   The board has apples at (1,0). The enemy is at (0,0), apple at (1,0). The enemy can easily eat that. They are likely to move RIGHT to (1,0).\n        *   If they move RIGHT, their head goes to (1,0). Their body will extend.\n        *   They are far from me.\n\n    *   **Final Choice:**\n        *   Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n        *   LEFT is death.\n        *   RIGHT (9,5): Wall.\n        *   UP (8,6): Safe, but limits future moves if I hit the wall.\n        *   DOWN (8,4): Safe, keeps center/right access open.\n        *   Target: (9,2) apple.\n        *   Path: (8,4) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2).\n        *   This seems like the best play to score a point safely and keep options open.\n\n    *   **Double Check on `DOWN` -> (8,4)**\n        *   Is there an apple at (8,4)? No.\n        *   Is (8,4) blocked? No.\n        *   Is (8,4) safe from enemy head movement? Yes.\n        *   Does it allow freedom? Yes.\n\n    *   **Double Check on `RIGHT` -> (9,5)**\n        *   Is (9,5) blocked? No.\n        *   Is it on the wall? Yes, x=9 is max.\n        *   Is it risky? Yes, because I am trapped against the wall. If an apple spawns at (8,5) later (where I came from), I might have trouble looping back.\n        *   But going DOWN to (8,4) moves me away from the wall slightly.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   DOWN vs UP vs RIGHT.\n        *   UP: Goes to (8,6). Can go to (6,8). But (7,6) is risky.\n        *   DOWN: Goes to (8,4). Can go to (9,2). Clear path.\n        *   RIGHT: Goes to (9,5). Can go to (9,2). Clear path, but stuck on wall.\n        *   Since DOWN and RIGHT both go to (9,2), but DOWN is one step off the wall, DOWN is better.\n\n    *   **Wait, is (7,6) actually risky?**\n        *   Current body: `(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)`.\n        *   If I go UP to (8,6):\n            *   Head (8,6).\n            *   Body: `(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)`.\n            *   Next move to (7,6): (7,6) is empty.\n            *   Wait, (7,6) is NOT in the body list `(8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4)`.\n            *   So (7,6) is technically safe.\n        *   But I have to be careful NOT to hit (7,5) in the future if I don't eat.\n        *   If I go UP -> (8,6), then RIGHT -> (9,6), then DOWN -> (9,5), then LEFT -> (8,5). This loops around. (8,5) would be my tail if I don't eat. So (8,5) would be safe only after my tail moves.\n        *   So UP is actually quite safe too.\n        *   However, the goal is to eat apples.\n        *   (9,2) is reachable from DOWN and RIGHT.\n        *   (6,8) is reachable from UP.\n        *   (9,2) is at distance 3.\n        *   (6,8) is at distance 3 (Manhattan) or 2.8 (Euclidean).\n        *   However, (6,8) is near the top-left. My body is currently in the bottom-left/middle.\n        *   (9,2) is bottom-right. My head is at (8,5).\n        *   Since I am on the right side, (9,2) is the logical target.\n        *   Therefore, DOWN is the best move to initiate the approach to (9,2).\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the board again.**\n        *   `5 T T T T . . . T 1 .` -> Head (8,5).\n        *   `4 T . . . . T T T . .` -> Body at (7,4), (6,4), (5,4).\n        *   `3 T . . . . . . . .`\n        *   `2 T . . . . . . . . A` -> Apple (9,2).\n        *   `1 T . . . . . . A . .` -> Apple (7,1).\n        *   `0 0 A . . . . . . . .`\n        *   The enemy (0,0) is at the bottom left.\n        *   My path to (9,2) via DOWN is clear.\n        *   My path to (9,2) via RIGHT is clear.\n        *   My path to (6,8) via UP is clear but involves a turn.\n        *   I will choose DOWN because it moves me towards two apples ((9,2) and (7,1)) and keeps me off the wall.\n\n    *   **Actually, let's check if I can eat an apple this turn.**\n        *   Apples are at (7,1), (6,8), (9,2), (1,0), (0,6).\n        *   My head (8,5).\n        *   UP (8,6): No.\n        *   DOWN (8,4): No.\n        *   LEFT (7,5): Body.\n        *   RIGHT (9,5): No.\n        *   So I cannot eat this turn. I am moving towards an apple.\n\n    *   **Final Decision:**\n        *   I will move **DOWN**.\n        *   Target: (9,2).\n        *   Reasoning: Safest path, keeps options open, avoids wall, moves towards a close apple.\n\n    *   **Wait, let me check the apples again.**\n        *   (7,1) is at x=7, y=1.\n        *   (9,2) is at x=9, y=2.\n        *   My head (8,5).\n        *   Distance to (7,1): |8-7| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n        *   Distance to (9,2): |8-9| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n        *   Distance to (6,8): |8-6| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n        *   (9,2) is the closest by Manhattan distance.\n        *   So moving towards (9,2) is correct.\n        *   Direction towards (9,2) from (8,5): DOWN (y) and RIGHT (x).\n        *   RIGHT moves x closer, DOWN moves y closer.\n        *   RIGHT -> (9,5). Distance to (9,2) = 3.\n        *   DOWN -> (8,4). Distance to (9,2) = |8-9| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n        *   Both reduce distance by 1.\n        *   However, (8,4) is better because it allows me to turn to (9,4) next, getting distance 2.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (9,5), I have to go DOWN to (9,4).\n        *   So (8,4) is effectively the same speed but safer.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a trap?**\n        *   The enemy has 8 apples. They are strong.\n        *   I need to play safe.\n        *   I will move DOWN.\n\n    *   **Correction:** I will move **RIGHT**.\n        *   Why? Let's re-evaluate.\n        *   My body is at (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (8,4), my body becomes (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4).\n        *   Next turn, I can go (9,4), then (9,3), then (9,2).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (9,5), my body becomes (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4).\n        *   Next turn, I can go (9,4), then (9,3), then (9,2).\n        *   The path is identical in length.\n        *   However, RIGHT puts me at the edge immediately. DOWN keeps me one step away.\n        *   The rule says \"keep future options open\".\n        *   (9,5) has 3 exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n        *   (8,4) has 4 exits.\n        *   So (8,4) is more open.\n        *   Why would I choose RIGHT? Maybe to block a potential enemy? No enemy nearby.\n        *   So DOWN is better for options.\n        *   But wait, (9,5) is closer to (9,2) in terms of absolute coordinate? (9,5) is x=9, (9,2) is x=9. They share X. (8,5) is x=8.\n        *   Moving RIGHT fixes X to 9. Then I only need to move DOWN.\n        *   Moving DOWN leaves X at 8, so I have to move RIGHT later.\n        *   Moving RIGHT first seems more direct to the apple's X coordinate.\n\n        *   **Let's look at the board state for `.`.**\n        *   Row 5: `.` at x=4,5,6,8,9.\n        *   Row 4: `.` at x=1,2,3,4,8,9.\n        *   Row 3: All `.`.\n        *   Row 2: `.` at x=1..8.\n        *   So (8,4) is open.\n        *   (9,5) is open.\n        *   (9,4) is open.\n\n        *   **Hypothesis:** The enemy might move up the left side. I need to secure food on the right side.\n        *   (9,2) is the target.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I am at (9,5).\n        *   If I go DOWN, I am at (8,4).\n        *   If I go DOWN, then RIGHT, I am at (9,4).\n        *   If I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I am at (9,4).\n        *   So effectively the same position in 2 turns.\n        *   However, if I go DOWN now, and the apple at (9,2) is eaten by a random spawn (unlikely but possible) or if I need to switch targets, I have more flexibility at (8,4).\n        *   If I go RIGHT now, I am committed to the wall.\n        *   **Wait, is there an apple at (9,2)?** Yes.\n        *   Is it safe to assume I can get it? Yes.\n        *   The path (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) is clear.\n        *   The path (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) is clear.\n        *   Let's check if my tail blocks anything.\n        *   Tail starts at (5,4).\n        *   If I eat an apple at turn 4 (reaching (9,2)), my tail won't have moved much. It will be around (6,4) or (7,4).\n        *   So no self-collision risk.\n\n        *   **Decision:**\n        *   I will move **RIGHT**.\n        *   Why? It puts me exactly on the column of the target apple (9,2). It aligns me perfectly. It's slightly more aggressive.\n        *   Actually, looking at the last move rationale: \"Moving RIGHT keeps me in the center and opens up the board\".\n        *   My last move was RIGHT (to get to (8,5)). So I am continuing to the right.\n        *   My current head is (8,5). Moving RIGHT gets me to (9,5).\n        *   (9,5) is the edge. Is that \"opening up the board\"? No, it limits it.\n        *   The last rationale said \"Moving RIGHT keeps me in the center\". That was for (7,5) -> (8,5). (8,5) is center-ish.\n        *   (9,5) is the edge.\n        *   So moving RIGHT again contradicts the \"keep options open\" strategy unless I am absolutely sure about (9,2).\n        *   Let's go back to **DOWN**.\n        *   (8,4) is safer, more flexible. It's one step off the wall. It allows me to turn to (9,4) or (7,4) or (8,3).\n        *   (9,5) forces me to go DOWN (to (9,4)) or LEFT (back to (8,5)). UP is open but away from apple.\n        *   (8,4) allows UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n        *   I'll stick with **DOWN**.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's check the enemy snake's potential move.**\n        *   Enemy #0 is at (0,0).\n        *   Apples at (1,0).\n        *   They will likely go RIGHT to (1,0).\n        *   This doesn't affect me.\n\n    *   **Final check on DOWN:**\n        *   Head (8,5) -> (8,4).\n        *   Is (8,4) blocked?\n        *   My body: (7,5), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4).\n        *   (8,4) is not in that list.\n        *   Enemy: No.\n        *   Wall: No.\n        *   Backwards?

From the board state, row 1, col 8 is an 'A' (apple at (8, 1) based on the map). Wait, looking at the map provided:\n    Row 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\n    Col 8 is the 9th character (0-indexed). That is an 'A'.\n    So DOWN moves to (8, 1) and eats an apple.\n\n**Wait, looking at the apple list vs the map:**\nApples: (7, 1), (6, 8), (9, 2), (0, 6), (2, 2).\nMap row 2: `T . A . . . . . 1 A` -> (2, 2) is 'A' and (9, 2) is 'A'.\nMap row 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .` -> (7, 1) is 'A'.\nMap row 8: ` . . . . . . A . . .` -> (6, 8) is 'A'.\n\nSo:\n- **DOWN** to (8, 1). Map shows '.' at (8,1)? Let's re-read the map carefully.\n    Row 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\n    Indices: 0: T, 1: ., 2: 0, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: A, 8: ., 9: .\n    So (8, 1) is empty ('.').\n    **Correction**: My last rationale mentioned an apple at (8, 1), but the map shows '.' at (8, 1) and 'A' at (7, 1).\n    Let's re-evaluate the targets:\n    - UP: (8, 3). Body. **INVALID**.\n    - DOWN: (8, 1). Empty ('.'). Valid.\n    - LEFT: (7, 2). Empty ('.'). Valid.\n    - RIGHT: (9, 2). Apple ('A'). Valid.\n\n**Safety & Strategy:**\n- **RIGHT (9, 2)**: Eating an apple.\n    - Snake #0 is at (2, 1).\n    - If I go RIGHT, I grow. New tail at (8, 2).\n    - Next turn, I cannot go LEFT (backwards into old head).\n    - Is it safe from Snake #0? Snake #0 is far left.\n- **DOWN (8, 1)**: Moving down.\n    - Target (8, 1) is empty.\n    - Moves me closer to apple at (7, 1).\n    - If I go DOWN, next turn I can go LEFT to (7, 1) to eat.\n\n**Comparison:**\nRIGHT gets an apple immediately.\nDOWN sets up a move to get an apple next turn.\nHowever, we need to consider Snake #0.\nSnake #0 at (2, 1). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- RIGHT (3, 1): Empty. Moves toward center.\n- UP (2, 2): Has apple.\n- DOWN (2, 0): 'T' (body).\n- LEFT (1, 1): Empty.\n\nSnake #0 is likely to go UP to eat the apple at (2, 2) or RIGHT to advance.\nMy position (8, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2) and eat:\n- I am at (9, 2).\n- My body extends to (8, 2).\n- Snake #0 moves. Let's say it goes UP to (2, 2) (apple).\n- Next turn, my options at (9, 2):\n    - LEFT (back to 8,2) -> hits my body (tail).\n    - UP (9, 3): Empty.\n    - DOWN (9, 1): Empty? Map row 1 col 9 is '.'.\n    - RIGHT (9, 2)? Wait, I'm at 9,2. RIGHT is wall. Dead.\n    - So at (9, 2), I have UP and DOWN. I am pinned against the wall. This is a \"dead end\" scenario. I lose mobility.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1):\n- I am at (8, 1).\n- Next turn, I can go LEFT to (7, 1) (apple).\n- Or UP to (8, 2) (old head).\n- Or RIGHT to (9, 1) (empty).\n- This keeps me more mobile and away from the wall.\n\nLet's check LEFT to (7, 2):\n- Moves to (7, 2).\n- Next turn, I can go DOWN to (7, 1) (apple).\n- Or UP to (7, 3) (empty).\n- Or LEFT to (6, 2) (empty).\n- This is also mobile.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, DOWN (8, 1) is closer to the center in terms of x (8 is closer to center than 7? No, 5 is center).\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nApple at (7, 1).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2), I am closer to the wall (x=0) than if I stay at x=8? No, x=7 is closer to x=0 than x=8.\nActually, x=8 is very close to the wall at x=9.\nGoing DOWN to (8, 1) is still close to the wall.\nGoing LEFT to (7, 2) is slightly more central, but still on the right side.\n\nHowever, the immediate goal is apples.\nRIGHT gets an apple NOW.\nDOWN sets up for (7, 1) next turn.\nLEFT sets up for (7, 1) next turn.\n\nLet's look at the \"openness\" score from my last rationale. I was at (8, 3) and went DOWN to (8, 2).\nCurrent pos: (8, 2).\nTargets:\n1. RIGHT (9, 2): Apple. But traps me against wall. BAD.\n2. DOWN (8, 1): Empty. Opens up (7, 1) next.\n3. LEFT (7, 2): Empty. Opens up (7, 1) next.\n\nIs there any threat from Snake #0?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT (3, 1), it moves towards me.\nIf Snake #0 goes UP (2, 2), it eats an apple.\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN (2, 0), it dies (Body).\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT (1, 1), it moves to empty.\n\nSnake #0 has 9 apples. It's large. It needs to grow.\nApple at (2, 2) is directly above it. It is very likely to go UP.\nIf Snake #0 goes UP, it moves away from me.\n\nSo, I should avoid the wall.\n**RIGHT is a trap.**\nI should choose between DOWN and LEFT.\nComparing DOWN (8, 1) and LEFT (7, 2):\n- DOWN (8, 1):\n    - Next moves: UP (8,2), LEFT (7,1), RIGHT (9,1).\n    - (7,1) is an apple.\n    - (8,2) is my tail (safe after I move).\n- LEFT (7, 2):\n    - Next moves: DOWN (7,1), UP (7,3), LEFT (6,2).\n    - (7,1) is an apple.\n    - (7,2) is safe.\n\nDistance to apple at (7, 1):\n- From (8, 1): 1 step (LEFT).\n- From (7, 2): 1 step (DOWN).\n\nWhat about the apple at (9, 2)? That's the one I can reach immediately by going RIGHT.\nBut going RIGHT puts me at (9, 2). I would be trapped.\nIs there any way out?\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2) (Apple), my body is [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5)].\nNext turn at (9, 2):\n- UP: (9, 3). Empty.\n- DOWN: (9, 1). Empty.\n- LEFT: (8, 2). My body.\n- RIGHT: Wall. Dead.\nSo I have 2 options (UP, DOWN). This is \"constricted\".\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1):\nNext turn at (8, 1):\n- UP: (8, 2). My tail.\n- DOWN: (8, 0). Wall? Row 0 is valid. (8, 0) is '.' (Map row 0: `T T T . . . . . . .`). Wait, Map row 0 col 8 is '.'.\n- LEFT: (7, 1). Apple.\n- RIGHT: (9, 1). Empty.\nSo 4 options, but UP is into tail (temporary obstacle).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2):\nNext turn at (7, 2):\n- UP: (7, 3). Empty.\n- DOWN: (7, 1). Apple.\n- LEFT: (6, 2). Empty.\n- RIGHT: (8, 2). Tail.\nSo 4 options.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer (8, 1) over (7, 2)?\n(8, 1) is closer to the wall at x=9.\n(7, 2) is slightly more central.\nHowever, (8, 1) allows me to access (9, 1) (RIGHT), which is closer to the apple at (9, 2) if I want to circle back?\nNo, (9, 2) is blocked by my tail if I go (8,1) -> (9,1)?\nWait, if I go DOWN to (8, 1):\nMy tail is at (7, 5).\nThe body follows: (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> ...\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1), next turn I am at (8, 1). My tail moves to (8, 3).\nIf I then go RIGHT to (9, 1), I am at (9, 1).\nNext turn I can go UP to (9, 2) to eat the apple.\nThis path is: (8,2) -> (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,2).\nThis is a valid safe path to the apple at (9, 2) without trapping myself immediately.\n\nPath from LEFT (7, 2):\n(8,2) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) [Eats apple].\nAt (7, 1), I am at x=7.\nFrom (7, 1), going RIGHT to (8, 1) is blocked by my body (since I just came from (8, 2) -> (7, 2), the body tail is at (8, 2)? No, let's trace:\nStart: Head (8, 2), Body [(8, 3)...]\nMove LEFT to (7, 2).\nNew Head: (7, 2).\nNew Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), ...]\nNext turn at (7, 2):\n- DOWN to (7, 1) (Apple).\n- New Head: (7, 1).\n- New Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), ...]\n- At (7, 1), RIGHT is (8, 1). This is empty. So I can move there.\n- From (7, 1), I can go to (9, 2)? (7,1) -> (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,2).\nPath exists.\n\nSo both LEFT and DOWN allow me to eventually get to (9, 2).\nHowever, DOWN gets me closer to (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\nLEFT gets me to (7, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\nThe apple at (7, 1) is there.\nSnake #0 at (2, 1).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2), I am at x=7.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1), I am at x=8.\n\nIs there any difference in \"future options\"?\nAt (8, 1):\n- Can go DOWN to (8, 0) (empty).\n- Can go LEFT to (7, 1) (Apple).\n- Can go RIGHT to (9, 1) (empty).\n- Can go UP to (8, 2) (Tail, but valid if I don't crash immediately? No, moving into body is death).\n    - Actually, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n    - If I go DOWN, my body fills in (8, 2).\n    - So at (8, 1), UP moves into (8, 2), which is now my body. **DEAD**.\n    - So at (8, 1), I have 3 options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). But DOWN is into the wall row? Row 0 is valid.\n    - Row 0 at col 8 is '.'.\n    - So 3 safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nAt (7, 2):\n- Can go DOWN to (7, 1) (Apple).\n- Can go UP to (7, 3) (empty).\n- Can go LEFT to (6, 2) (empty).\n- Can go RIGHT to (8, 2) (Tail).\n    - RIGHT is backwards? No, I came from (8, 2). So (8, 2) is the segment connecting to head.\n    - So (8, 2) is body. Moving into it is death.\n    - So 3 safe options (DOWN, UP, LEFT).\n\nBoth seem to offer 3 immediate safe moves.\nHowever, (8, 1) is on the edge (x=8 is close to wall x=9).\n(7, 2) is slightly more central.\nBut (8, 1) allows me to access the apple at (9, 2) via (9, 1).\nPath to (9, 2):\n- (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\n  - (9, 1) is empty.\n  - (9, 2) is apple.\n  - Is (9, 1) safe? Map row 1 col 9 is '.'.\n  - Is (9, 2) safe? Apple.\n  - Path is clear.\n\nPath to (9, 2) from (7, 2):\n- (8, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\n  - Longer.\n\nPath to (7, 1) from (8, 1):\n- 1 move.\nPath to (7, 1) from (7, 2):\n- 1 move.\n\nSo (8, 1) gives access to (7, 1) AND sets up for (9, 2).\n(7, 2) gives access to (7, 1) BUT delays (9, 2).\n\nWait, is there any apple at (8, 1)? Map says '.'.\nSo I'm not eating immediately.\nI am positioning.\n\nLet's check Snake #0's reach.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nApple at (2, 2) (UP).\nApple at (7, 1) (Far right).\nApple at (9, 2) (Far right).\nSnake #0 will likely go UP to (2, 2).\nEven if it goes RIGHT, it is far away.\n\nSo the decision is purely positional.\n(8, 1) vs (7, 2).\n(8, 1) puts me at x=8.\n(7, 2) puts me at x=7.\n(8, 1) is 1 step from (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\n(7, 2) is 2 steps from (9, 2).\n(8, 1) is 1 step from (7, 1).\n(7, 2) is 1 step from (7, 1).\n\nIf I take (7, 1) from (8, 1):\n- (8, 1) -> (7, 1). I eat.\n- My body becomes [(8, 1), (8, 2), ...].\n- I am at (7, 1).\n- Next moves: (7, 0), (6, 1), (8, 1). (7, 1) is blocked by wall? No.\n- (7, 0) is empty? Row 0 col 7: `T T T . . . . . . .` -> Empty.\n- So I can go to (7, 0).\n\nIf I take (7, 1) from (7, 2):\n- (7, 2) -> (7, 1). I eat.\n- My body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), ...].\n- I am at (7, 1).\n- Next moves: (7, 0), (6, 1), (8, 1). (8, 1) is empty?\n- (8, 1) is empty.\n- So I can go to (8, 1).\n\nActually, going LEFT to (7, 2) is safer in terms of distance from the wall.\nBut going DOWN to (8, 1) gives a straight shot to (9, 2) later.\n\nLet's re-verify the \"BACKWARDS\" rule.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1), my head was at (8, 2).\nMy body will have (8, 2) as the first segment.\nIf I then try to go UP to (8, 2), that's the cell directly behind me. Dead.\nSo I can't go UP.\nI can go LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2), my head was at (8, 2).\nMy body will have (8, 2).\nIf I try to go RIGHT to (8, 2), Dead.\nI can go LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nOkay, so mobility is similar.\n\nWhat about the apple at (6, 8)?\nFrom (8, 1), distance is large.\nFrom (7, 2), distance is large.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nSnake #0 at (2, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT (3, 1).\nIf I am at (8, 1), distance is 5.\nIf I am at (7, 2), distance is 4.\nDistance doesn't matter much yet.\n\nHowever, look at the board.\nRow 5: `T T . . . . . T T .`\nThere are body parts of Snake #0 at (0, 5) and (7, 5), (8, 5).\nWait, row 5: `T T . . . . . T T .`\nIndex 0: T, 1: T, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: T, 8: T, 9: .`\nMy body has (7, 5) and (8, 5).\nSnake #0 has (0, 5), (1, 5).\n\nSo the board at Y=5 is blocked at x=0,1 and 7,8.\nThis creates a bottleneck.\n\nLet's look at the \"OPEN\" spaces.\nRows 0-4 are mostly open.\n\nStrategy:\n- I have 4 apples. Snake #0 has 9.\n- I need to catch up.\n- The apple at (9, 2) is \"mine\" if I take the path.\n- The apple at (7, 1) is also mine.\n- I should try to secure (9, 2) safely.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1):\n- Next turn I can go RIGHT to (9, 1).\n- Next turn I can go UP to (9, 2).\n- This is a 3-turn path to the apple, without turning.\n- At (9, 1), I am safe. Row 1 col 9 is empty.\n- At (9, 2), I eat.\n- At (9, 2), I can go DOWN (9, 1) or UP (9, 3).\n- This is a \"corridor\" on the right wall.\n- It's safe but tight.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2):\n- I can go DOWN to (7, 1) next turn.\n- At (7, 1), I can go RIGHT to (8, 1).\n- Then to (9, 1) -> (9, 2).\n- This path is longer but more flexible.\n- At (7, 1), I have (7, 0) and (6, 1) as exits.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (7, 2), I am at (7, 2).\nMy body is (8, 2) ...\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (3, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (2, 2).\nIs there a risk of Snake #0 coming to (7, 2)? No.\n\nLet's compare the \"future options\" at the destination.\nDest (8, 1):\n- Neighbors: (9, 1) [empty], (7, 1) [apple], (8, 0) [empty].\nDest (7, 2):\n- Neighbors: (8, 2) [tail], (6, 2) [empty], (7, 1) [apple], (7, 3) [empty].\n\n(8, 1) has a wall at (9, 1)? No, (9, 1) is valid.\n(8, 1) has a wall at (8, 0)? No, valid.\nSo (8, 1) is an \"interior\" corner (near the wall).\n\n(7, 2) is completely surrounded by empty space (except tail).\n\nIs there any reason to NOT go to (7, 2)?\nIf I go to (7, 2), I am closer to the left side where Snake #0 is.\nBut Snake #0 is slow.\nIf I go to (8, 1), I am closer to the wall on the right.\n\"Openness\" in my last rationale was about avoiding walls.\nSo LEFT to (7, 2) is more \"open\" than DOWN to (8, 1).\n\nHowever, RIGHT to (9, 2) is the apple.\nWhy did I dismiss RIGHT?\nBecause I get trapped.\nLet's double check if I die immediately at (9, 2).\nTarget (9, 2). Is it occupied?\nMy body is (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5).\nSo (9, 2) is free.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nSo RIGHT is a valid move to eat an apple.\nBut:\n- I grow.\n- My head becomes (9, 2).\n- My body extends to (8, 2).\n- Next turn, at (9, 2):\n    - UP: (9, 3). Safe.\n    - DOWN: (9, 1). Safe.\n    - LEFT: (8, 2). **Body**.\n    - RIGHT: Wall.\n- So I have 2 moves.\n- Is 2 moves enough?\n- Yes, usually.\n- But I lose access to the left side of the board easily.\n- I have to go UP or DOWN on the right edge.\n- If I go UP, I might eventually get to (9, 8) where the apple is?\n- Apple is at (6, 8).\n- From (9, 2) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 4)... -> (9, 8).\n- Path is clear?\n- Row 8: ` . . . . . . A . . .`\n- (9, 8) is empty.\n- From (9, 8) I can go LEFT to (8, 8).\n- So I can escape the right wall eventually.\n- So maybe RIGHT is not a trap, just a \"corridor\".\n\nBUT, I am currently at (8, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2):\n- I am at (9, 2).\n- Next turn I must go UP or DOWN.\n- If I go UP to (9, 3), I am safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (9, 1), I am safe.\n- I can eventually get to (6, 8).\n- However, I am moving away from (7, 1).\n- (7, 1) is very close.\n- (9, 2) is also close.\n\nLet's calculate the \"value\" of each move.\n1.  **RIGHT**: Eat apple now. Score becomes 5.\n    - Pros: Immediate point. Snake #0 is far.\n    - Cons: Pinned to wall. Lose mobility for 1 turn.\n2.  **DOWN**: Move to (8, 1). No apple.\n    - Pros: Opens path to (9, 2) AND (7, 1). Keeps mobility.\n    - Cons: No immediate point.\n3.  **LEFT**: Move to (7, 2). No apple.\n    - Pros: Opens path to (7, 1). More central.\n    - Cons: Moves away from (9, 2).\n\nSnake #0 has 9 apples. I have 4.\nI need to catch up.\nI should take the apple at (9, 2) if it doesn't kill me.\nDoes it kill me? No.\nDoes it make it hard to survive?\nWith only 2 moves (UP/DOWN), I am constrained.\nBut I have 5 body segments. If I eat, I have 6.\nIf I go UP to (9, 3), then RIGHT is wall, LEFT is body, DOWN is (9, 1).\nSo I can zig-zag: (9, 2) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 4)...\nOr: (9, 2) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0)...\nOr: (9, 2) -> (9, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0)...\nWait, if I go (9, 2) -> (9, 1) -> (8, 1).\nAt (9, 2), move DOWN to (9, 1).\nAt (9, 1), move LEFT to (8, 1).\nIs (8, 1) free?\nMy body will be: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5).\n(8, 1) is free.\nSo I can escape the wall by going DOWN then LEFT.\nSo the wall is not a permanent trap.\nTherefore, **RIGHT is a viable move** to get an apple now.\n\nNow compare RIGHT vs DOWN/LEFT.\nRIGHT gets me 1 apple now.\nDOWN/LEFT gets me set up for an apple next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get +1 apple.\nIf I go DOWN, next turn I can go LEFT to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 1).\nIf I go DOWN -> LEFT (7, 1), I get +1 apple in 2 turns.\nSo RIGHT is faster.\nIf I go DOWN -> RIGHT -> UP (9, 2), that is also 2 turns.\nSo RIGHT is 1 turn, others are 2 turns (for the apple at (9, 2)).\n\nWait, what about the apple at (7, 1)?\nFrom (8, 2):\n- RIGHT to (9, 2): 1 turn.\n- DOWN to (8, 1): 1 turn, then LEFT to (7, 1): 2 turns.\n\nSo RIGHT wins on speed for the apple at (9, 2).\nIs there a risk of Snake #0 moving to (9, 2)? No.\nIs there a risk of collision?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1).\nSnake #0 moves. It will likely go UP to (2, 2).\nSo no collision.\n\nSo, is it safe to take the apple?\nYes.\nIs it smart?\nI am at (8, 2). If I go RIGHT to (9, 2), I eat.\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (9, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1).\nThis gets me the apple at (9, 2) and positions me for (7, 1).\nThis seems very strong.\n\nLet's double check if I'm hallucinating the map.\nMap:\nRow 2: `T . A . . . . . 1 A`\nHead is at (8, 2) ('1').\nApple at (2, 2) ('A').\nApple at (9, 2) ('A').\nRow 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\nApple at (7, 1) ('A').\n\nSo targets are correct.\nRIGHT is the best move to secure points.\n\nWait, does moving RIGHT block any future path?\nI am at (9, 2).\nMy body is (8, 2), ...\nIf I want to go to (7, 1), I can go DOWN (9, 1), LEFT (8, 1), DOWN? No, LEFT (8, 1) from (9, 1).\n(9, 1) -> (8, 1).\n(8, 1) is empty.\nSo the path is open.\nSo RIGHT is safe and effective.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if Snake #0 moves to (3, 1) or something.\nSnake #0 at (2, 1).\nIf it goes RIGHT to (3, 1), it is still far.\nIf it goes UP to (2, 2) (apple), it is safe.\nIt has 9 apples. It needs 41 more to win. It will play safe.\nIt will likely take the apple at (2, 2).\nSo I am safe.\n\nLet's check the \"backwards\" rule again for RIGHT.\nCurrent head: (8, 2).\nMove: RIGHT to (9, 2).\nMy body moves: (8, 2) becomes body.\nIf I go LEFT next turn, I hit (8, 2). Dead.\nBut I can go DOWN, UP, or eventually escape.\nSo I am not stuck immediately.\nI have options.\n\nSo, **RIGHT** is the optimal move.\n\nWait, let's check the apples again.\nApples at: (7, 1), (6, 8), (9, 2), (0, 6), (2, 2).\nI am at (8, 2).\nRIGHT takes (9, 2).\nThis is the closest apple.\nIt is a good move.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid the wall?\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1), I have more space in x direction.\nBut RIGHT gives points.\nIn Snake, points are life (growth, distance).\nSo points > slight mobility difference.\nI should take the apple.\n\nOne check: Snake #0 is at (2, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (2, 2), it eats.\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (3, 1), it moves towards center.\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN (2, 0), it dies.\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT (1, 1), empty.\nSnake #0 is long (10 segments).\nIt needs to avoid walls.\n(2, 2) is an apple.\nIt will almost certainly take the apple.\n\nSo I am safe to take mine.\n\nFinal check on safety of (9, 2).\nOccupied? No.\nWall? No.\nMy body? No.\nEnemy head? No.\nEnemy body? No (Snake #0 is at x=0-2 mostly, y=0-5).\nSo it's safe.\n\nSo the move is **RIGHT**.\n\nWait, I should write the rationale.\nRationale:\nI am at (8, 2).\nAvailable moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nUP: (8, 3) is my body. Invalid.\nDOWN: (8, 1) is empty.\nLEFT: (7, 2) is empty.\nRIGHT: (9, 2) is an apple.\nRIGHT gives an immediate point.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1), far away. It will likely take the apple at (2, 2).\nI can safely take the apple at (9, 2).\nAlthough (9, 2) is against the wall, I can escape by going DOWN then LEFT.\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\nOne detail: \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), and Snake #0 goes something...\nIs there any move Snake #0 can make that kills me?\nNo, distance is too large.\n\nSo I will go RIGHT.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm not hallucinating the apple at (9, 2).\nBoard:\nRow 2: `T . A . . . . . 1 A`\nYes, column 9 is 'A'.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne final check. My last move was DOWN from (8, 4) to (8, 3).\nWait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\".\nAnd \"Current head at (8, 2)\".\nSo I moved DOWN from (8, 3) to (8, 2).\nThat matches.\n\nSo I'm ready.\n\nReasoning summary:\n1.  Identify current position: (8, 2).\n2.  Identify safe moves: DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2). UP is invalid.\n3.  Identify targets: Apple at (9, 2) is reachable immediately by RIGHT.\n4.  Evaluate safety of target (9, 2): Safe.\n5.  Evaluate future mobility at (9, 2): Constricted, but escapable.\n6.  Compare with other moves: Other moves don't give points immediately.\n7.  Conclusion: Take the point.\n\nThis seems solid.\n\nWait, I should consider if Snake #0 can move to (9, 2) in one turn?\nDistance from (2, 1) to (9, 2) is large. No.\n\nOkay, proceeding.\n\nOne check on the \"Apple at (7, 1)\".\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 1), I am 1 step away from (7, 1).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2), I am 1 step away from (7, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), I am 2 steps away from (7, 1) (via (9,1)->(8,1)).\nSo RIGHT delays (7, 1) slightly.\nBut (9, 2) is a \"now\" point.\nPoints are priority.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nOne detail. My body is [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)].\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), my body becomes [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\nWait, (7, 5) falls off if I don't eat.\nIf I EAT (at 9, 2), I grow. (7, 5) stays.\nMy body becomes [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)].\nSo length 6.\nThis is good.\n\nOkay, I am confident in RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis is standard Cartesian.\nI will provide the rationale and the move.\n\nFinal check on the board map text:\n\"2 T . A . . . . . 1 A\"\nIndices: 0:T, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:1, 9:A.\nWait. The head is at (8, 2).\nThe '1' at index 8 is the head.\nThe 'A' at index 9 is the apple.\nSo my head is at (8, 2) and the apple is at (9, 2).\nCorrect.\n\nI will output the rationale and \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, the prompt asks for \"One word\".\nSo I will output \"RIGHT\".\n\nI need to make sure I don't add any other text after the word.\n\nRationale:\n- Current head (8, 2).\n- Moves:\n  - UP: (8, 3) (Body). Invalid.\n  - DOWN: (8, 1) (Empty).\n  - LEFT: (7, 2) (Empty).\n  - RIGHT: (9, 2) (Apple).\n- Snake #0 is far away at (2, 1).\n- RIGHT offers an immediate apple.\n- Although (9, 2) is against the wall, I can escape (e.g., DOWN to (9, 1), LEFT to (8, 1)).\n- Therefore, RIGHT is the best move to score points.\n\nWait, I should check if I can go DOWN to (9, 1).\nRow 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\nIndices: 0:T, 1:., 2:0, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.\nSo (9, 1) is empty.\nYes.\n\nOkay, ready.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent head at (8, 2). Available moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- UP: Target (8, 3) is my current body segment. Collision.\n- DOWN: Target (8, 1) is empty.\n- LEFT: Target (7, 2) is empty.\n- RIGHT: Target (9, 2) contains an apple ('A').\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1) and poses no immediate threat to the right side of the board. Taking the apple at (9, 2) provides an immediate score increase. While moving to the edge limits mobility slightly, I can escape by moving DOWN to (9, 1) and then LEFT to (8, 1). Therefore, securing the point is the priority.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the format says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I should write the rationale block, then the move word.\n\nI'll format it clearly.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent head at (8, 2). Body segments are immediately accessible if I move UP (blocked).\nAvailable moves:\n- DOWN to (8, 1): Empty.\n- LEFT to (7, 2): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (9, 2): Apple.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1), far to the left. It is likely to move UP to eat the apple at (2, 2). There is no risk of collision with Snake #0 if I move RIGHT.\nMoving RIGHT secures an immediate apple. Although it places my head against the wall at x=9, I can escape by moving DOWN to (9, 1) or UP to (9, 3) in subsequent turns.\nTaking the apple is the best strategic move to catch up in score (4 vs 9).\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne tiny detail. The prompt mentions \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\".\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), my previous position was (8, 2).\nMy body will fill in (8, 2).\nIf I go LEFT next turn, I hit (8, 2).\nSo I cannot go LEFT.\nI can go DOWN, UP, or eventually LEFT if I move DOWN first.\nSo I am safe.\n\nFinal check. The prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I must ensure \"RIGHT\" is the last line.\n\nI will output the rationale block and then \"RIGHT\".\n\nDouble check the coordinates.\n(8, 2) -> (9, 2).\nX increases by 1. That is RIGHT.\nCorrect.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent head at (8, 2). Body segments are at (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5).\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (8, 3) is occupied by my body. Invalid.\n- DOWN: (8, 1) is empty.\n- LEFT: (7, 2) is empty.\n- RIGHT: (9, 2) is an apple.\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1) and cannot reach (9, 2) this turn. Moving RIGHT secures an immediate point, which is critical since I am trailing 4 to 9. Although (9, 2) is against the wall, I can safely navigate away by moving DOWN or UP next turn. Therefore, taking the apple is the optimal move.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, I should double check the \"START LAST MOVE INFO\" from the prompt.\n\"My last move information: ... DOWN ... Current head at (8, 2)\"\nIf I moved DOWN from (8, 3) to (8, 2), then (8, 3) is now occupied by my body.\nYes.\nSo UP is indeed death.\n\nOkay. The plan is solid.\n\nOne final check on the apple at (7, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT, I get (9, 2).\nIf I go DOWN, I can get (7, 1) in 2 moves.\n(9, 2) is worth the same as (7, 1).\nBut (9, 2) is closer (1 move vs 2 moves).\nSo RIGHT is faster.\n\nAlso, the apple at (7, 1) is close to Snake #0's domain (left side).\nSnake #0 might decide to go for it later if it clears its left side.\nSo getting (9, 2) now secures it before Snake #0 gets there (impossible for Snake #0 to get there soon, but good practice).\n\nOkay.\n\nOne check on the board map.\nRow 1: `T . 0 . . . . A . .`\n(7, 1) is 'A'.\nRow 2: `T . A . . . . . 1 A`\n(2, 2) is 'A', (9, 2) is 'A'.\nRow 8: ` . . . . . . A . . .`\n(6, 8) is 'A'.\n\nAll apples accounted for.\n\nI will output the response.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent head at (8, 2). Available moves:\n- UP: Target (8, 3) is occupied by my body. Illegal.\n- DOWN: Target (8, 1) is empty.\n- LEFT: Target (7, 2) is empty.\n- RIGHT: Target (9, 2) is an apple.\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1) and poses no threat to my right side. Taking the apple at (9, 2) immediately increases my score. While moving to the edge limits immediate options, I can escape by moving DOWN or UP in subsequent turns. Scoring a point to close the gap (4 vs 9 apples) is the priority.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",
