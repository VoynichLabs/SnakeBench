Keep at least two safe move options whenever possible. Avoid moving into areas heavily occupied or with limited escape routes.\n\n**Final decision:**\n\nRIGHT",

It also does not risk immediate collision, and it aligns with the current goal of approaching that nearby apple.\n\nMoving right is the most advantageous as it:\n- Moves us closer to the closest apple.\n- Maintains safe options for future moves.\n- Keeps us in a position to try to eat the apple at (9,5) on the next turn.\n\nGiven the current safe options and strategic goal, I will choose to move RIGHT.\n\n**Final move:**\n\nRIGHT",
