NO BODIES YET, IT'S A FRESH START!\n\nFirst, let's scan the four directions:\n*   **UP** to (8,8): Free space. Let's see the board... yep, it's empty. Safe.\n*   **DOWN** to (8,6): Also looks clear, no snakes, no walls. Safe.\n*   **LEFT** to (7,7): That's right next to my current spot, looks empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT** to (9,7): OOOOH, Chat, look! That's the edge of the map! RIGHT would send me OFF THE BOARD! YIKES! \u274c\u274c\u274c That's an INSTANT DEATH! So RIGHT is ELIMINATED.\n\nSo our safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\nNow, STRATEGY TIME. We gotta be AGGRESSIVE. We wanna box this guy in. He's at (6,9). The board's wide open, but look at those apples clustered on the left side, like (1,2), (2,4)... that's our content! But more importantly, we need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,7), I'm moving closer to the center and putting myself between him and a big section of the board. UP to (8,8) keeps me on the top edge, which might be limiting. DOWN to (8,6) goes towards the bottom, but maybe we let him come to us? \ud83e\udd14\n\nNAH, CHAT. WE PUSH. We go on the offensive IMMEDIATELY. Moving LEFT gets me closer to controlling the center and applying pressure. It gives me options to go UP, DOWN, or even further LEFT next turn. We're not playing scared!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Head towards the center-left to control the board and cut off the enemy's access to the main apple clusters. Be ready to intercept his path. Force him into a corner.\n\nAlright, the choice is clear. LET'S MOVE!\n\nLEFT",
