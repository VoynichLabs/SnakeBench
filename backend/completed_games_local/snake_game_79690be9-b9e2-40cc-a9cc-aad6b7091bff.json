My body is [(0,0)]. \n   - After the move, the new body should be [(0,0)] (the old head position), but wait - the old body (0,0) becomes... \n   - Actually, since my body is [(0,0)], moving DOWN to (0,0) means my head moves into my current tail cell. \n   - But my tail will move away from (0,0) in the same turn (it will move to where the next body segment was, but there are no more segments). \n   - The new body would be the old head position (0,1). \n   - So I'd be at (0,0) with body [(0,1)]. \n   - That means I'm NOT hitting myself because the tail leaves that spot simultaneously. \n   - This is safe!

Head: (1,1), Body: [(0,1), (0,0)]\".\nAnd the board shows:\n`1 T 1 ...` at row y=1.\nLet's parse the board line for y=1: `1 T 1 . . . . . . .`\nCoordinates: (0,1) is the first character. It says `1`. (My body?)\n(1,1) is the second character. It says `T`. (My head?)\n(2,1) is the third character. It says `1`. (???)\n\nAh, looking at the **START LAST MOVE PICK** section:\n`RIGHT`\nAnd the previous state: \"Head: (0,1)\".\nSo the previous move was RIGHT to (1,1).\nThe board display is confusing because it shows characters based on ID. Snake #1 is ID 1.\nThe line `1 T 1 . .` suggests:\n(0,1): '1' (Snake #1 body)\n(1,1): 'T' (Snake #1 Tail?) No, T usually means Tail.\nBut the description says \"Body: [(0,1), (0,0)]\".\nIf (0,1) is the body and (1,1) is the head, and the previous move was RIGHT, then:\nBefore move: Head (0,1), Body [(0,0)].\nAfter move: Head (1,1), Body [(0,1)].\nThe board display `1 T 1` is likely:\n- (0,1): '1' (Body of snake #1)\n- (1,1): 'T' (Head of snake #1... or maybe 'T' is just the character for snake #1?) No, \"T\" is usually Tail.\nLet's look at row 0: `T . .`\nIf (0,0) is `T`, and it's the tail, that matches \"Body: ... (0,0)\" being the tail.\nSo (1,1) is `T`? No, (1,1) is the head.\nMaybe the display uses 'T' for Head? No, usually Head is the ID number.\nLet's re-read the \"Rules\": \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\".\n\"Head: (1, 1)\", \"Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]\".\nSo the full snake is (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nThe board display `1 T 1` at row 1 is likely:\n- (0,1): '1' (Part of Snake #1)\n- (1,1): 'T' (Part of Snake #1)\n- (2,1): '1' (This is strange, maybe it's a typo in the board generation or I am misreading the columns).\nLet's look closely at the board row y=1:\n`1 T 1 . . . . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 ...\n(0,1): 1\n(1,1): T\n(2,1): 1\n\nIf (1,1) is the Head, and it shows 'T', maybe the visualization uses 'T' for the head of Snake #1? No, the prompt says \"Snake #1... Apples: 2\". It doesn't say the character for the head is 'T'.\nUsually, '1' is the head.\nMaybe the board is:\nRow 1: `T 1 . .` ? No, `1 T 1 ...`.\nLet's assume the board is just a visual representation and the text description is the ground truth.\nHead is (1,1).\nBody is (0,1).\nTail is (0,0).\n\n**Re-evaluating moves from (1,1):**\n- **LEFT** to (0,1): Into my body. DEAD. (Confirmed).\n- **UP** to (1,2): Empty.\n- **DOWN** to (1,0): Empty (Previous board showed (1,0) as '.', and (0,0) as 'T').\n- **RIGHT** to (2,1): Empty.\n\n**Apple Locations:**\n(7, 3), (4, 2), (2, 6), (7, 6), (6, 3)\nDistance from (1,1):\n- (4,2): 4 steps\n- (2,6): 6 steps\n- (6,3): 7 steps\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\nHead: (8, 3).\nBody: none.\nIt is far away.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to move towards the cluster of apples at (4,2) and (6,3)/(7,3).\nFrom (1,1), moving **UP** to (1,2) or **RIGHT** to (2,1) are both good.\n(2,1) is closer to (4,2) by x-distance.\n(1,2) is on the path to (2,6).\nGiven that (4,2) is the closest apple, **RIGHT** seems the most direct route.\nLet's check if (2,1) is safe. Yes, it's empty.\nIs (2,1) safe from enemy #0? Enemy #0 is at (8,3).\nIf enemy #0 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, it cannot reach me this turn.\n\nLet's consider potential traps.\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I might be near the top wall if I continue up.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I open up the right side.\nI should avoid moving into tight spaces.\n(1,1) is in the corner (bottom-left is 0,0).\nMoving RIGHT is generally safer to avoid getting boxed in the corner.\n\nLet's double check the board row 0:\n`T . . . . . . . . .`\n(0,0) is 'T'. (1,0) is '.'.\nSo DOWN to (1,0) is safe.\nHowever, (1,0) is moving away from all apples. (4,2) is up and right.\nMoving DOWN to (1,0) is a bad long-term play.\n\nSo the choice is between UP and RIGHT.\nBoth are safe.\nRight moves towards (4,2).\nUp moves towards (2,6).\n(4,2) is closer (4 steps) than (2,6) (6 steps).\nSo RIGHT is better.\n\nLet's check if there are any nuances.\nWhat if I go RIGHT to (2,1).\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) or (2,2).\n(2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) is 3 moves. (Apple at 4,2).\nTotal moves: 1 (this turn) + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nWhat if I go UP to (1,2).\n(1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) is 3 moves.\nTotal moves: 1 + 3 = 4. Also 4 moves to (4,2).\n\nBut if I go UP, I am moving along y=2.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving along y=1.\nNeither offers a distinct advantage for (4,2).\nHowever, if I want to pivot to (6,3) or (7,3) later, moving RIGHT gets me closer to x=6,7.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nHead at (8,3).\nIf the enemy wants to eat (7,3), it can go LEFT to (7,3).\nI am at (1,1).\nI can't intercept it this turn.\nBut I might want to intercept it later if we race for the same apple.\nThe apples at (6,3) and (7,3) are close to the enemy.\nThe apples at (4,2) and (2,6) are closer to me.\nI should focus on (4,2) and (2,6).\n\nIs there a reason to prefer UP?\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I might be able to move LEFT... No, can't go back.\nIs there a reason to prefer RIGHT?\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), and then UP to (2,2), I am at (2,2).\nFrom (2,2), I can go UP to (2,3) or RIGHT to (3,2).\n(2,3) is empty on the previous board (row 3: ... `.` at index 2).\nWait, row 3: `... A A 0 .`. (2,3) is '.'.\n\nLet's think about the tail.\nCurrent tail: (0,0).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1):\nHead: (2,1)\nBody: [(1,1), (0,1)]\nTail: (0,0) moves to (0,1)? No, tail moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\nWait, \"The snake... grows by 1 segment\" if it eats an apple.\nI didn't eat an apple this turn.\nSo the tail moves forward to the position of the second-to-last segment.\nCurrent body: [(0,1), (0,0)].\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1):\nNew Head: (2,1)\nNew Body: [(1,1), (0,1)] (The old head becomes the new body segment 1, old body segment 1 becomes segment 2).\nOld Tail: (0,0) is removed.\nSo the cell (0,0) becomes empty.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2):\nNew Head: (1,2)\nNew Body: [(1,1), (0,1)]\nTail (0,0) removed.\nCell (0,0) empty.\n\nBoth moves result in the same body structure relative to the head, just different locations.\n\n**Wait, I missed something.**\nThe prompt says: \"My snake (ID: 1): Head: (1, 1), Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]\".\nThis is the *current* state, after my last move (RIGHT).\nThe previous state was Head (0,1), Body [(0,0)].\nSo the prompt confirms I am at (1,1).\n\nIs there any danger in moving RIGHT?\n(2,1) is empty.\nIs there any danger in moving UP?\n(1,2) is empty.\nIs there any danger in moving DOWN?\n(1,0) is empty.\n\nIs there any danger of the enemy snake moving into my path?\nEnemy #0 at (8,3).\nIt can move to (7,3), (9,3), (8,2), (8,4).\nNone of these threaten me.\n\n**Let's reconsider the apples.**\n(4,2) is the closest.\n(2,6) is next closest.\nIf I go RIGHT (towards 4,2), I am moving away from (2,6).\nIf I go UP (towards 2,6), I am moving away from (4,2).\nWait, (1,1) to (4,2) is \"Right and Up\".\n(1,1) to (2,6) is \"Up and Right\".\nActually, (4,2) is strictly to the Right and slightly Up.\n(2,6) is strictly Up and slightly Right.\nFrom (1,1):\n- To (4,2): \u0394x=+3, \u0394y=+1.\n- To (2,6): \u0394x=+1, \u0394y=+5.\n\nIf I go UP now, I am committing to the Y-axis for a while.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am committing to the X-axis for a while.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow y=1: `1 T 1 . . . . . . .`\nWait, I am confused by the board rendering again.\nIf (0,1) is '1' (Body) and (1,1) is 'T' (Head), then (2,1) is '1'.\nWhat is that '1' at (2,1)?\nMaybe it's the enemy snake? No, enemy snake #0 is at (8,3).\nMaybe it's just noise or a visualization artifact.\nLet's trust the text description: \"Head: (1,1), Body: [(0,1), (0,0)]\".\nSo (2,1) is empty.\nThe '1' at (2,1) in the ASCII art must be a visual artifact or I'm miscounting columns.\nThe columns are marked `0 1 2 3 ... 9`.\nRow 1: `1 T 1 ...`\nIndex 0: '1'\nIndex 1: 'T'\nIndex 2: '1'\nIf (1,1) is my head, and the character is 'T', and (0,1) is my body, character '1'.\nIs it possible the snake ID is displayed?\nSnake #1 is ID 1.\nMaybe 'T' is just how the head of ID 1 is drawn? Or maybe 'T' is a typo for '1'.\nRegardless, the description is clear. (2,1) is NOT part of my body. My body is (0,1) and (0,0).\nSo (2,1) is safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have 3 apples. I need 50 to win. I should play safely but greedily for the nearest apple.\nThe nearest apple is (4,2).\nTo get to (4,2), I need to move generally Right.\nMoving RIGHT to (2,1) is a direct step towards (4,2).\nMoving UP to (1,2) is a diagonal step towards (4,2) but less direct in terms of X.\n\nHowever, (2,6) is also an apple.\nIf I go UP, I get closer to (2,6).\nIf I go RIGHT, I get closer to (4,2).\n\nLet's look at the \"Rationale\" from the previous turn.\nIt said: \"From there, I can consider moving toward (2,6) or (4,2) apples\".\nSo both are valid targets.\n\nIs there a reason to avoid a direction?\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0), I go into the bottom row. This limits my future moves (can't go DOWN further).\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I go into row 2. Still plenty of room.\nIf I go LEFT, I hit my body. Dead.\nIf I go RIGHT, I go into column 2.\n\nLet's look at the board for row 2:\n`2 . . . . A . . . . .`\n(2,2) is '.'.\n(3,2) is '.'.\n(4,2) is 'A'.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I am at (1,2).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1) (into my old body, DEAD), LEFT to (0,2) (Safe), or RIGHT to (2,2) (Safe).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), I am at (2,1).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (2,2), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1) (into my old body, DEAD), or RIGHT to (3,1).\n\nSo both moves open up 3 safe options for the next turn. Good.\n\n**Why choose RIGHT over UP?**\nThe apple at (4,2) is slightly closer in \"Manhattan Steps\" if I strictly follow the shortest path.\nPath to (4,2) via RIGHT: R, U, R, R. (4 moves).\nPath to (4,2) via UP: U, R, R, R. (4 moves).\nIt's a tie.\nPath to (2,6) via UP: U, U, U, U, U. (5 moves).\nPath to (2,6) via RIGHT: R, U, U, U, U, L. (6 moves).\nUP is strictly better for (2,6).\nRIGHT is strictly better for (4,2).\n\nWhich apple is safer?\n(4,2) is near the bottom of the board.\n(2,6) is near the top.\n(7,3) is near the bottom right.\n(7,6) is near the top right.\n(6,3) is near the bottom right.\n\nThe bottom of the board has apples at (4,2), (7,3), (6,3).\nThe top has (2,6), (7,6).\n\nIf I go UP, I am committing to the top half.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committing to the bottom half (initially).\n\nIs there a danger in the bottom half?\nEnemy #0 is at (8,3). That's bottom right.\nI am at (1,1). Bottom left.\nThere are 3 apples in the bottom half: (4,2), (6,3), (7,3).\nThere are 2 apples in the top half: (2,6), (7,6).\nThe bottom half has more apples.\nAlso, (2,6) is quite high up (y=6).\n(4,2) is low (y=2).\n\nLet's consider the \"future options open\" rule.\nIf I go UP, I am near the top (y=2). If I go UP again, I'm at y=3. Still plenty of space.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at x=2. Still plenty of space.\n\nHowever, if I go UP, I am moving away from the enemy snake (which is at y=3). The enemy is at (8,3). If I go to (1,2), I am at y=2. If I go to (2,1), I am at y=1.\nThe enemy is at y=3. I am moving slightly closer in Y to the enemy by going UP? No, 2 is closer to 3 than 1 is to 3.\nSo moving UP puts me slightly closer to the enemy's Y coordinate.\n\nBut the enemy is far away in X.\n\nLet's look at the board one more time.\nRow 1: `T 1 . . .`\nWait, I am still puzzled by the 'T' at (1,1).\n\"Your snake (ID 1)... Head: (1,1)\"\n\"Enemy snake #0... Head: (8,3)\"\nBoard at row 3: `... A A 0 .`\nSo (7,3) is 'A', (8,3) is '0' (Enemy #0). Correct.\nRow 1: `1 T 1 ...`\nIf (0,1) is '1', (1,1) is 'T', (2,1) is '1'.\nIs it possible that the '1' at (2,1) is the *Tail* of a previous state or something?\nNo, the description is authoritative.\n\"Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]\".\nSo (0,1) is the body. (0,0) is the tail.\n(1,1) is the head.\n(2,1) is NOT part of the snake.\nI will assume the board visualization is slightly misleading or I'm misparsing the \"1 T 1\" pattern.\nMaybe `1` is the body, `T` is the head?\nBut the prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 1)\".\nUsually the head is represented by the ID number.\nIf the head is '1', then (0,1) would be '1' too (it's part of the snake).\nIf (0,1) is '1' and (1,1) is '1', then (2,1) being '1' would mean the snake goes (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\nBut the prompt says the list is ordered Head-to-Tail: [(1,1), (0,1), (0,0)].\nSo (1,1) is the head.\nI will trust the text description of coordinates over the ASCII art if they conflict.\n\n**Decision Summary:**\n- Move RIGHT is safe.\n- Move RIGHT moves me towards the closest apple cluster (bottom half).\n- Move RIGHT keeps me in a central area relative to the walls.\n- Move UP is also safe and moves towards (2,6).\n\nWhy might I prefer UP?\nIf the enemy moves left towards (7,3) and (6,3), the bottom right gets crowded.\nIf I stay low (y=1 or 2), I might compete for (4,2) or (7,3).\nIf I go high (y=6), I compete for (2,6) and (7,6).\nThe enemy is at (8,3). They are stuck between (6,3) and (7,3).\nIf I go UP, I am away from that conflict.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving into that zone (eventually).\n\nHowever, (4,2) is very far from (8,3). It's a safe apple.\n(2,6) is far from (8,3) too.\n\nLet's look at the \"Turn: 2 / 150\".\nThis is very early.\nI have 3 apples. Enemy has 0.\nI should definitely take a safe apple.\n(4,2) is 4 steps away.\n(2,6) is 6 steps away.\n(4,2) is closer.\n\nIs there a trap at (4,2)?\nLet's look at the board for y=2:\n`. . . . A . . . . .`\nIt's empty around it.\n(4,1) is empty? Row 1: `1 T 1 ...` (4,1) is '.'.\n(4,3) is empty? Row 3: `... A A 0 .` (4,3) is '.'.\n(3,2) is empty.\n(5,2) is empty.\nSo (4,2) is safe to approach.\n\n**What about the immediate move?**\nRIGHT to (2,1).\nFrom (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2).\nFrom (2,2), I can go UP to (2,3).\nFrom (2,3), I can go UP to (2,4).\nFrom (2,4), I can go RIGHT to (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2). (This is a longer path).\nOr: From (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).\nPath: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2). (4 moves).\nIf I go UP now:\n(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2). (4 moves).\nSame distance.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), I am at x=2.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I am at y=2.\n\nLet's consider the enemy.\nEnemy at (8,3).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,3), it eats an apple and grows.\nMy body is short (length 2 currently? Head + 2 body = 3? Wait.\nHead (1,1), Body [(0,1), (0,0)].\nThat's 3 segments.\nSo length 3.\nIf I eat an apple, length 4.\nEnemy is length 1 (Head at 8,3, no body).\nIf enemy eats (7,3), it becomes length 2.\n\nIs there any reason to block the enemy?\nThe enemy is far away. I can't block it this turn.\nI should focus on my own game.\n\nLet's check if (2,1) is blocked by anything else.\nThe board shows `1 T 1 . . .`\nIf that '1' at (2,1) is actually part of a snake, then I can't go there.\nBut the text description says \"Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]\".\nIt doesn't mention (2,1).\nIf (2,1) was occupied by the snake, the body list would include it.\n\"Snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\".\nSo the list is complete.\n(2,1) is NOT part of the snake.\nTherefore (2,1) is empty.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- LEFT: HITS OWN BODY (0,1). DEAD.\n- DOWN: SAFE.\n- UP: SAFE.\n- RIGHT: SAFE.\n\nDOWN is bad (moves away from apples).\nRIGHT is good (towards apple).\nUP is good (towards apple).\nWhich apple?\n(4,2) is closer than (2,6).\nSo RIGHT or UP?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (2,1).\nNext turn I can go UP to (2,2).\nIf I go UP, I am at (1,2).\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2).\nBoth converge at (2,2) eventually to get to (4,2).\n\nIs there any \"backward\" rule to consider?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself.\"\nMy previous move was RIGHT. So I came from (0,1).\nGoing LEFT would be backwards. That's invalid.\nGoing UP, DOWN, RIGHT are not backwards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are viable.\nRIGHT puts me slightly closer to the (4,2) apple in terms of Manhattan distance if I don't turn immediately.\nWait, Manhattan distance from (1,1) to (4,2) is |1-4| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nFrom (2,1) to (4,2) is |2-4| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nFrom (1,2) to (4,2) is |1-4| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3.\nThey are equal.\n\nLet's look at the (6,3) and (7,3) apples.\nDistance from (1,1):\n(6,3): 5 + 2 = 7.\n(7,3): 6 + 2 = 8.\nFrom (2,1):\n(6,3): 4 + 2 = 6.\n(7,3): 5 + 2 = 7.\nFrom (1,2):\n(6,3): 5 + 1 = 6.\n(7,3): 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nRight is consistently slightly closer to the bottom-right apples.\nUp is closer to (2,6).\n\nLet's pick RIGHT to start moving towards the cluster of 3 apples at the bottom.\n\nWait, is there a trap at (1,1)?\nThe enemy is at (8,3).\nI am safe.\n\nLet's consider the \"Multi-apple\" aspect.\nI should probably eat one apple, then maybe go for another nearby.\nThe apples at (6,3) and (7,3) are adjacent? No, (6,3) and (7,3) are adjacent (diagonal? No, (6,3) and (7,3) are horizontal neighbors).\nWait, the board shows:\nRow 3: `... A A 0 .`\n(6,3) is 'A'. (7,3) is 'A'. (8,3) is '0'.\nSo there are two adjacent apples at (6,3) and (7,3).\nIf I can eat (4,2), I can then move towards (6,3)/(7,3).\n(4,2) to (6,3) is distance 2+1=3.\n(4,2) to (7,3) is distance 3+1=4.\n(4,2) to (2,6) is distance 2+4=6.\n(4,2) to (7,6) is distance 3+4=7.\n(4,2) to (6,3) is 3.\n(2,6) to (7,3) is 5+3=8.\nSo (4,2) is a great pivot point for the bottom cluster.\n(2,6) is a pivot point for the top cluster.\n\nWhich cluster is safer?\nEnemy is at (8,3).\nIf enemy eats (7,3), it becomes length 2.\nIf I go for (6,3), I might conflict with the enemy.\nBut (4,2) is safely far from (8,3).\n(2,6) is also safely far.\n(2,6) is closer to the top wall. (y=9 is top).\n(4,2) is close to bottom wall. (y=0 is bottom).\n(4,2) is y=2. Safe.\n(2,6) is y=6. Safe.\n\nLet's just pick RIGHT. It moves towards the densest apple cluster (3 apples vs 2).\nAlso, moving RIGHT prevents me from getting stuck in the leftmost column.\nIf I go UP, I'm still in column 0 or 1. If I go RIGHT, I'm in column 2.\nColumn 0 is a dead end if I go up too far. Column 2 is safer.\n\nOne specific check:\nIs (2,1) occupied by the enemy?\nNo, enemy is at (8,3).\nIs (2,1) occupied by me?\nNo.\nIs (2,1) off board?\nNo.\n\nOkay. I will move RIGHT.\n\nOne final check: The prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), and the enemy moves LEFT to (7,3), we are far apart.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8,4) or DOWN to (8,2), we are far apart.\nNo head-on collision risk.\n\nI will write the reasoning.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  **Current State**: Head at (1,1). Body [(0,1), (0,0)]. Tail at (0,0).\n2.  **Move Elimination**:\n    *   LEFT: Hits my body at (0,1). Eliminated.\n    *   DOWN: To (1,0). Safe but moves away from all apples. Suboptimal.\n    *   UP: To (1,2). Safe. Moves towards (2,6) and (4,2).\n    *   RIGHT: To (2,1). Safe. Moves towards (4,2) and the bottom apple cluster.\n3.  **Apple Selection**:\n    *   Apples at (4,2), (6,3), (7,3) (bottom cluster, 3 apples).\n    *   Apples at (2,6), (7,6) (top cluster, 2 apples).\n    *   (4,2) is the closest apple (4 steps).\n    *   (2,6) is the next closest (6 steps).\n    *   Moving RIGHT commits me to the bottom cluster, which has more apples and is less crowded (enemy is far right at x=8, I am at x=1).\n4.  **Future Safety**:\n    *   Moving RIGHT opens up the board. I am not trapped against the left wall.\n    *   Enemy is at (8,3). No immediate threat.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI must ensure I don't add anything after that word.\n\nLet's write the plan.\n\"Move towards the bottom apple cluster at (4,2). From (2,1), head to (2,2) then (3,2) to reach (4,2) safely. Avoid the left wall.\"\n\nActually, let's check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" example again.\nIt ends with the move word.\n\"RIGHT\"\nThen the rationale block ends.\nThe rationale block starts with `**START RATIONALE**` and ends with `**END RATIONALE**`.\nThe move word is *inside* the rationale block in the example?\nNo, looking at the example:\n`**START LAST RATIONALE**`\n`...`\n`RIGHT`\n`**END RATIONALE**`\nWait, in the example, the move word \"RIGHT\" is written *after* the rationale text but *inside* the block? No.\nThe example says:\n`**START RATIONALE**`\n`... rationale text ...`\n`**END RATIONALE**`\n`RIGHT`\nAh, no. The example shows:\n`**START LAST RATIONALE**`\n`**START RATIONALE**`\n`...`\n`RIGHT`\n`**END RATIONALE**`\nWait, the example is:\n```\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**START RATIONALE**\n...\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n```\nWait, there is a `RIGHT` at the end of the `**START LAST MOVE PICK**` block.\nAnd there is a `RIGHT` at the very end of the `**END LAST RATIONALE**` block?\nNo, let's look again at the example provided in the prompt.\nThe example is the text *I am supposed to generate*.\nThe prompt shows what the *previous* turn looked like.\nPrevious turn had:\n`**START LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`RIGHT`\n`**END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`**START LAST RATIONALE**`\n`... rationale ...`\n`RIGHT`\n`**END LAST RATIONALE**`\n\nWait, the `RIGHT` inside the rationale block... is that part of the rationale or the move?\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nSo the structure is:\n1. Rationale (can contain my plan).\n2. The Move Word (on its own line).\n\nThe example shows:\n`**START RATIONALE**`\n`...`\n`RIGHT`\n`**END RATIONALE**`\n`RIGHT`\nThis suggests the move word appears *twice*? Or maybe the first `RIGHT` is inside the rationale text as an example of a decision.\nBut the instructions say: \"The final non-empty line... must be exactly one word\".\nThis implies the move word is the very last thing.\n\nLet's look at the example in the prompt again.\n```\n**START RATIONALE**\n...\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the optimal move...\n...\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT\n```\nAh, the `RIGHT` inside the rationale is in a sentence \"**Decision:** RIGHT...\".\nThe `RIGHT` after `**END RATIONALE**` is the final move line.\nSo the structure is:\nText...\n`**END RATIONALE**`\n`RIGHT`\n\nOkay, I will follow that.\n\nPlan for next turn:\n\"Target apple at (4,2). Move RIGHT to (2,1). Next turn move UP to (2,2) then RIGHT to (3,2) to approach (4,2). Avoid enemy at (8,3).\"\n\nWait, I should not specify the *next* turn's move explicitly in the plan, but rather the general strategy.\n\"Moving towards the bottom-right apple cluster. Target (4,2) first, then (6,3) and (7,3).\"\n\nLet's refine the rationale.\nCurrent: (1,1).\nOptions:\n- LEFT: Hits body.\n- DOWN: Moves away from food.\n- UP: Safe, moves towards (2,6).\n- RIGHT: Safe, moves towards (4,2) and the denser cluster of apples.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nDouble check the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block in the prompt.\nIt says `RIGHT`.\nSo the user input format supports `**START LAST MOVE PICK**` `RIGHT` `**END LAST MOVE PICK**`.\nI should probably output my move in a similar block for clarity? The instructions don't say I *have* to use those tags for my output, only that I should \"think out loud\" and \"explain reasoning\".\nHowever, the prompt asks me to \"You are controlling a snake... Turn: 2... Your last move information...\".\nThis implies I should output the move for *this* turn.\nThe final output should be the move word.\n\nWait, the instructions say \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo:\n[My Rationale/Plan]\n[The Move Word]\n\nExample structure:\n\"**START RATIONALE**\"\n[My reasoning]\n\"**END RATIONALE**\"\n\"RIGHT\"\n\nI will just write the reasoning and then the move.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I can just write text, then the move word.\nThe tags `**START RATIONALE**` etc. are just showing what was in the *previous* turn's input.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself.\"\nMy body is behind me at (0,1).\nI am at (1,1).\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (0,1).\nMy body is there.\nSo LEFT is death.\nCorrect.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT? (2,1). Safe.\nWhat if I move UP? (1,2). Safe.\nWhat if I move DOWN? (1,0). Safe.\n\nI'm sticking with RIGHT.\n\nLet's think about the enemy again.\nSnake #0: Head (8,3). No body.\nApples at (7,3) and (6,3).\nSnake #0 is right next to (7,3).\nSnake #0 is very likely to move LEFT to (7,3) to eat the apple.\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7,3), it will be at (7,3).\nMy head is at (1,1).\nDistance is large.\nNo collision risk.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 moves UP or DOWN?\nIt stays at x=8.\nStill safe.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 moves RIGHT?\nIt dies (off board, x=10? No, x=9 is max. (8,3) -> (9,3) is valid. Wait, max is 9. So (8,3) -> (9,3) is valid).\nSo (9,3) is on board.\nBut (9,3) is empty.\n\nSo Snake #0 is safe regardless of its move (except maybe Left into something? No, (7,3) is apple).\n\nOkay, I am confident in RIGHT.\n\nPlan:\nMove towards the apple at (4,2). This is the closest apple and part of a cluster of 3 apples in the bottom right. Avoid getting trapped against the left wall. From (2,1), I will continue towards (4,2).\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't output anything after the move word.\nSo I will write the text, then \"RIGHT\" on a new line.\n\nOne small check:\nIs it possible that (1,1) is actually (0,1) and the text description is wrong?\n\"Head: (1, 1)\".\n\"Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]\".\n\"Last move: RIGHT\".\nIf I started at (0,1), moved RIGHT to (1,1), then body is (0,1) and tail (0,0).\nThis matches.\nSo I am definitely at (1,1).\n\nFinal check on the move:\n- Safe? Yes.\n- Good for apples? Yes.\n- Good for future? Yes.\n\nI will generate the response now**START RATIONALE**\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (1, 1), Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)].\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (8, 3).\n- Apples: (7, 3), (4, 2), (2, 6), (7, 6), (6, 3).\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 1):**\n1.  **LEFT**: Would move to (0, 1). This is the first segment of my body. Moving into my own body results in death. **ELIMINATED.**\n2.  **DOWN**: Would move to (1, 0). This cell is empty. Safe, but moves me further away from all reachable apples.\n3.  **UP**: Would move to (1, 2). This cell is empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Would move to (2, 1). This cell is empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy & Comparison:**\n- The closest apple is at **(4, 2)** (Manhattan distance: 4 steps).\n- The second closest is at **(2, 6)** (Manhattan distance: 6 steps).\n- Moving **RIGHT** puts me at (2, 1), which is a direct step towards the (4, 2) apple and the bottom-right apple cluster (which also contains (6, 3) and (7, 3)). This cluster has 3 apples.\n- Moving **UP** would be better for the (2, 6) apple, but that cluster only has 2 apples.\n- Moving **RIGHT** also keeps me away from the left wall, maintaining better maneuverability for future turns.\n\n**Decision:** Move **RIGHT** to pursue the apple at (4, 2) and the bottom-right cluster.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety and Strategy:**\n*   **Immediate Threats:**\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (6, 2). If he moves **LEFT** to (5, 2), he is not on my path to (4, 2).\n    *   If he moves **LEFT** to (5, 2), and I move **RIGHT** to (4, 2), we are safe.\n    *   If he moves **DOWN** to (6, 1), he is safe.\n    *   If he moves **UP** to (6, 3), he is on his own body (currently at (6, 3) as per the board, wait, looking at the board: row 3 has \"T T\" at 6 and 7. Enemy #0 head is at (6, 2). His body is at (6, 3). So he cannot move UP. He can move DOWN (to 6,1), LEFT (to 5,2), or RIGHT (to 7,2).\n    *   If Enemy #0 moves **RIGHT** to (7, 2), he hits his own body at (7, 3)? No, (7, 3) is at y=3, (7, 2) is at y=2. So he can move RIGHT.\n    *   Wait, the board shows Enemy #0 at (6, 2). The board shows \"T T\" in row 3 (y=3) at columns 6 and 7. So Enemy #0 body is at (6, 3) and (7, 3). Correct.\n\n*   **Targeting:**\n    *   The apple at **(4, 2)** is immediately to my **RIGHT**.\n    *   Distance to (4, 2) is 1.\n    *   My previous rationale stated that moving RIGHT to (3, 2) was the goal to get closer to (4, 2). I am now at (3, 2). Eating the apple is the priority.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (4, 2) allows me to eat an apple, grow, and score. It is the most aggressive and valuable move. It is currently safe from immediate collision with Enemy #0.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (4, 2). After eating, the snake will grow, and the tail will not move (turn 5 is a growth turn). New length will be 4. New head (4, 2). Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]. New tail: (2, 1).\nNext turn (Turn 6), evaluate moves from (4, 2). Options: (5, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1).\nTarget the next closest apple. The apple at (5, 4) or (7, 5) might be next. The apple at (2, 6) is also an option but requires going back left. Avoid Enemy #0 who will likely be at (5, 2) or (7, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 2)\n*   **My Body:** [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1)]\n*   **Turn:** 6 (All snakes move simultaneously).\n*   **Enemy #0:** Head at (5, 2). Body at [(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)] (inferred from board: head at (5,2) in my previous turn grew into (6,2) or moved? Wait, let's re-check the provided board state for accuracy).\n    *   **Board Check:** The provided board for Turn 6 shows Enemy #0 at `(5, 2)` with body extending to `(6, 2)` and `(6, 3)`.\n    *   **Movement Logic:** If Enemy #0 moved into `(5, 2)` last turn (Turn 5), their tail `(7, 3)` would stay put, making their body `(5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)` (if they grew) or `(5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)` (if they didn't grow). Assuming they are still length 3 (since their score is 2 and they haven't necessarily eaten this turn), their body segments are likely at `(5, 2)` (Head), `(6, 2)`, and `(6, 3)`.\n    *   **Enemy Options:** From (5, 2), Enemy #0 cannot move LEFT (into my body at (3, 2)? No, (4, 2) is me, (3, 2) is my body. Enemy is at (5, 2). Left is (4, 2) which is my head. Right is (6, 2) which is their body. Up is (5, 3) which is empty. Down is (5, 1) which is empty.\n    *   **Critical Observation:** Enemy #0 is **DIRECTLY** to my right at `(5, 2)`. This is adjacent to my head at `(4, 2)`.\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves (Simultaneous Turn):**\nI am at `(4, 2)`.\n*   **RIGHT:** To `(5, 2)`.\n    *   Enemy #0 is currently at `(5, 2)`.\n    *   Even if Enemy #0 moves away (e.g., DOWN to `(5, 1)` or UP to `(5, 3)`), their head was at `(5, 2)` at the start of the turn.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to `(5, 2)`, I am moving into the cell occupied by Enemy #0's head.\n    *   **Result:** Head-to-head collision. Both snakes die. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **LEFT:** To `(3, 2)`.\n    *   This cell contains my own body segment (my tail is (2,1), body includes (3,2)).\n    *   Moving backwards into your own body is illegal. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **UP:** To `(4, 3)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 3 (y=3) is ` . . . . . . T T . .`. At x=4, y=3, the character is `.` (empty).\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (5, 2). He might move UP to (5, 3). (5, 3) is empty. If he moves UP and I move UP, I go to (4, 3) and he goes to (5, 3). No collision.\n    *   Enemy #0 might move DOWN to (5, 1). (5, 1) is empty.\n    *   **Safe?** Yes, assuming I don't hit an apple or wall. No apple at (4, 3). No wall.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** To `(4, 1)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 1 (y=1) is ` . . T . . . . . . .`. At x=4, y=1, the character is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Safe?** Yes.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**3. Decision Making:**\n*   **Avoid Enemy:** Enemy #0 is at `(5, 2)`. He cannot move Right (body at 6,2). He cannot move Left (me at 4,2). He can only move Up or Down. I must not move into the cell he is leaving if he leaves it, nor the cell he is moving into.\n*   **Pathing:**\n    *   I am at `(4, 2)`.\n    *   Apples at `(5, 4)`, `(7, 5)`, `(2, 6)`, etc.\n    *   Moving **UP** puts me at `(4, 3)`. From here, I can access `(4, 4)` or `(5, 4)`.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** puts me at `(4, 1)`. From here, I can access `(4, 0)` (wall danger) or loop around.\n    *   Moving **UP** aligns me better with the apple at `(5, 4)`.\n    *   Moving **UP** keeps me away from the enemy who is likely to move Down or Up. If he moves Down to `(5, 1)`, I am at `(4, 3)`. If he moves Up to `(5, 3)`, I am at `(4, 3)`. Distance is maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT is fatal (head-on collision).\nMoving LEFT is fatal (suicide).\nMoving UP and DOWN are both safe.\nMoving UP positions me better for the cluster of apples at higher Y coordinates (2,6), (5,4), (7,5). Moving DOWN puts me in a corner and away from the apples.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving UP to (4, 3), check Enemy #0's new position. If he moved UP to (5, 3), I am safe at (4, 3). If he moved DOWN, I am safe. Next target will likely be the apple at (5, 4).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This is safer and puts me on a vector to intercept (2,6) or (5,4) safely.\n\n*   **Safety Check:**\n    *   If I go **UP** to (4,4) and Enemy goes **UP** to (5,4), I am next to the enemy (distance 1).\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (3,3) and Enemy goes **UP** to (5,4), I am distance 2 from the apple and distance 2 from the enemy.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (3,3) and Enemy goes **RIGHT** to (6,3), I am safely away.\n\n    *   **The \"Self-Collision\" Risk:**\n        *   If I go UP to (4,4), on the *next* turn, I cannot go DOWN (back into my own body).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (3,3), on the *next* turn, I cannot go RIGHT (back into my own body).\n        *   However, going LEFT effectively \"straightens\" my snake and removes the immediate diagonal threat.\n\n    *   **Final Choice Logic:**\n        *   The enemy is at (5,3).\n        *   Enemy cannot move Left or Down.\n        *   Enemy moves Right (to 6,3) or Up (to 5,4).\n        *   If I move UP (4,4): If Enemy moves Up (5,4), I am adjacent to a head. If Enemy moves Right (6,3), I am safe.\n        *   If I move LEFT (3,3): If Enemy moves Up (5,4), I am safe. If Enemy moves Right (6,3), I am safe.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** is consistently safer and positions me to grab the apple at (2,6) or (5,4) without immediately running into the enemy's likely path.\n\n    *   **Wait, reconsidering the apples:**\n        *   (5,4) is an apple.\n        *   If I move UP to (4,4), I am right next to it. If the enemy moves RIGHT (6,3), the apple at (5,4) is free for me to take next turn.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (3,3), I am further away.\n        *   However, if the enemy moves UP to (5,4) (eating the apple), they will grow. If I am at (4,4), I am adjacent to a larger enemy.\n        *   If I move LEFT, I avoid this risk.\n\n        *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   My head (4,3).\n        *   Enemy (5,3).\n        *   Enemy's body (5,2), (6,2).\n        *   Enemy cannot go Down. Cannot go Left.\n        *   Enemy is forced to go Up or Right.\n        *   I need to go Up or Left.\n        *   If I go Up (4,4): I am in a good position to snipe the apple at (5,4) *if* the enemy goes Right. If the enemy goes Up, I am in a dangerous spot (adjacent).\n        *   If I go Left (3,3): I am safe.\n        *   Is there a move that guarantees safety *and* keeps apples in play?\n        *   No, both are \"safe\" relative to immediate death.\n        *   However, the enemy is highly likely to go **UP** because there is an apple there. Enemies love apples.\n        *   If enemy goes UP, the space (5,4) is occupied.\n        *   If I go UP, I am at (4,4) next to (5,4). I cannot take the apple that turn. The enemy takes it.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am at (3,3).\n        *   If enemy goes UP (5,4), I can turn Up to (3,4) or (4,4) later.\n        *   If enemy goes Right (6,3), I can chase (5,4) later.\n\n        *   **Conclusion:** Moving **UP** seems slightly aggressive but viable. Moving **LEFT** is more defensive.\n        *   Let's look at the map again.\n        *   (5,4) is an apple.\n        *   (7,5) is an apple.\n        *   (2,6) is an apple.\n        *   (2,8) is an apple.\n        *   (7,6) is an apple.\n        *   I am at (4,3).\n        *   Going UP puts me at (4,4).\n        *   Going LEFT puts me at (3,3).\n\n        *   Let's re-evaluate the \"Enemy Path\".\n        *   Enemy at (5,3).\n        *   Option A: Enemy UP to (5,4). (Eats apple).\n        *   Option B: Enemy RIGHT to (6,3).\n        *   Enemy cannot move LEFT or DOWN.\n        *   If I move **UP** to (4,4):\n        *   If Enemy moves UP, I am at (4,4), Enemy at (5,4). Safe, but I don't get the apple.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, I am at (4,4), Enemy at (6,3). I can move RIGHT to (5,4) next turn and eat the apple.\n        *   If I move **LEFT** to (3,3):\n        *   If Enemy moves UP, I am at (3,3), Enemy at (5,4). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, I am at (3,3), Enemy at (6,3). Safe.\n\n        *   Risk analysis:\n        *   If I go UP and Enemy goes UP, I am adjacent to the enemy head. This is risky for the *next* turn.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am away from the enemy.\n        *   **Safety First.** The enemy is forced to move. I should move to a position where the enemy's forced moves don't endanger me.\n        *   If I go **LEFT** to (3,3), I create a buffer.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (4,4), I stay close to the enemy.\n        *   Given the enemy is likely to chase the apple at (5,4), I should probably not be at (4,4) waiting for them to bounce back or something.\n        *   Actually, if the enemy goes UP, they eat the apple. They are now at (5,4). I am at (4,4). They cannot move LEFT (my head is there if I went UP). They cannot move DOWN (body). They can move UP or RIGHT.\n        *   If the enemy goes UP, I am safe at (4,4).\n        *   But if I go LEFT, I am definitely safe.\n        *   Is there an advantage to UP?\n        *   If the enemy goes RIGHT (6,3), I am at (4,4). I can go RIGHT to (5,4) (Apple) next turn.\n        *   If I go LEFT, and enemy goes RIGHT, I am at (3,3). I can go UP to (3,4) -> RIGHT to (4,4) -> (5,4). It's slower.\n\n        *   Let's assume the enemy takes the apple (UP).\n        *   If I go UP, I am at (4,4).\n        *   Enemy at (5,4).\n        *   Next turn, Enemy cannot move LEFT or DOWN.\n        *   I cannot move DOWN (into my body).\n        *   This looks like a standoff.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am at (3,3).\n        *   Enemy at (5,4).\n        *   Next turn, I can go UP to (3,4).\n        *   This seems like a better setup to chase (2,6) or loop around.\n\n        *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 3: ` . . . . 1 0 . . . .`\n        *   My head at 4,3. Enemy at 5,3.\n        *   Enemy cannot move Left (4,3 is me).\n        *   Enemy cannot move Down (5,2 is their body).\n        *   Enemy must move Up or Right.\n        *   I can move Left or Up.\n        *   If I move **LEFT**:\n            *   I go to (3,3).\n            *   Enemy goes to (5,4) or (6,3).\n            *   If Enemy goes (5,4), I am at (3,3). Safe.\n            *   If Enemy goes (6,3), I am at (3,3). Safe.\n            *   I have full range of motion (Left, Up, Right, Down?) No, Down is (3,2) which is my body. So I have Left, Up, Right. Good options.\n        *   If I move **UP**:\n            *   I go to (4,4).\n            *   Enemy goes to (5,4) or (6,3).\n            *   If Enemy goes (5,4), I am at (4,4). We are adjacent. Enemy cannot move Left (4,4 is me). I cannot move Right (5,4 is enemy). We are stuck.\n            *   If Enemy goes (6,3), I am at (4,4). Safe.\n\n        *   The risk of moving UP is that if the enemy also moves UP (to eat the apple), I end up in a \"staring contest\" right next to them. It's better to give space.\n        *   Therefore, **LEFT** is the superior move to maintain safety and separation.\n\n        *   Wait, I should check if there is an apple at (3,3). No, empty.\n        *   Is there an apple at (2,3)? No.\n        *   Is there an apple at (1,3)? No.\n        *   Is there an apple at (0,3)? No.\n        *   Apples are at (2,6), (7,6), (5,4), (7,5), (2,8).\n        *   Moving Left moves me away from the cluster of apples (5,4, 7,5, 7,6) but towards (2,6) and (2,8).\n        *   However, safety is paramount. I can deal with the direction later.\n        *   Moving UP moves me towards the \"dangerous\" apple (5,4).\n        *   If I move LEFT, I can still pivot to UP or RIGHT later.\n        *   If I move UP, I might get cornered by the enemy taking the apple.\n\n        *   Let's double check the \"immediate death\" rules.\n        *   Move Left to (3,3). Is (3,3) on the board? Yes. Is it a wall? No. Is it my body? No (My body is at (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)). (3,3) is above (3,2).\n        *   Move Up to (4,4). Is it on board? Yes. Wall? No. My body? No.\n\n        *   Decision: **LEFT** seems safer. It creates distance from the enemy who is forced to move Up or Right.\n\n        *   One more check on the enemy body.\n        *   Enemy body: (5,2), (6,2).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (3,3), I am safe.\n        *   If I move UP to (4,4), I am safe *unless* the enemy moves UP.\n        *   Given the apples, the enemy is very likely to move UP.\n        *   If enemy moves UP, and I move UP, we are side-by-side.\n        *   If enemy moves UP, and I move LEFT, I am safe and have space.\n        *   If enemy moves RIGHT, and I move LEFT, I am safe.\n        *   If enemy moves RIGHT, and I move UP, I am safe.\n        *   The only scenario where UP is \"worse\" than LEFT is if Enemy moves UP.\n        *   So, to be safe against the most probable outcome (Enemy chasing apple), I should move LEFT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove LEFT to (3,3). This creates space between me and Enemy #0, who is forced to move Up or Right. This avoids a potential \"staring contest\" at the apple at (5,4). From (3,3), I can then pursue the apples at (2,6) or pivot back towards the right side if the enemy clears the way.\n\n**Move:**\nLEFT",

Body at [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)].\n    *   **Critical Observation:** Enemy #0 moved UP to `(5, 5)`. This cell was empty in the previous turn (represented by a `.` in the `0 . . . . .` line at y=5, x=5). They have not eaten an apple. My head is at `(2, 3)`.\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves (Simultaneous Turn):**\nI am at `(2, 3)`. My body is at `(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)`.\n\n*   **UP:** To `(2, 4)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 4 (y=4) is `. . . . . 0 . . . .`. At x=2, y=4, the character is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe. Moves me closer to the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8).\n\n*   **DOWN:** To `(2, 2)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 2 (y=2) is `. . . T T T T . . .`. The `T`'s occupy x=3, 4, 5, 6.\n    *   At x=2, y=2, the character is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe. However, this moves me away from the apples on the upper side of the board.\n\n*   **LEFT:** To `(1, 3)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 3 is `. . 1 T T T . . . .`. At x=1, y=3, the character is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n*   **RIGHT:** To `(3, 3)`.\n    *   Board check: Row 3 is `. . 1 T T T . . . .`. At x=3, y=3, the character is `T` (my body).\n    *   **Result:** Death (Self-collision).\n\n**3. Decision Making:**\nEliminating **RIGHT** (death) and **DOWN** (wrong direction, away from apples).\n\nWe are left with **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\n*   **Option UP (to 2, 4):**\n    *   **Pathing:** Moves directly towards the vertical cluster of apples at (2, 6) and (2, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:** Enemy #0 is at (5, 5).\n        *   If Enemy moves **Left** (to 4, 5): I am at (2, 4). We are 2 units apart (distance 4).\n        *   If Enemy moves **Up** (to 5, 6): I am safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves **Down** (to 5, 4): I am safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves **Right** (to 6, 5): I am safe.\n    *   **Safety:** High. This position (2, 4) is directly below the apple at (2, 6), offering a clear path.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to 1, 3):**\n    *   **Pathing:** Moves me onto the far left edge. The nearest apple is (1, 0) or (2, 6).\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:**\n        *   If Enemy moves **Left** (to 4, 5): I am at (1, 3). This is safe.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, but restrictive. Being at x=1 limits future Left moves. It forces me to likely go DOWN (towards 1,0) or UP (towards 2,6). The UP move is required to reach the denser apple cluster at (2,6)/(2,8). Moving LEFT first adds an extra turn to reach that cluster compared to moving UP immediately.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **UP** offers a more direct route to the high-value apple cluster (2,6, 2,8) and keeps the snake in the board center, maintaining flexibility.\n    *   **LEFT** forces me to the edge and delays reaching the main apple cluster.\n    *   Based on the previous turn's logic, which aimed to \"secure the apple at (2,6)\", moving **UP** is the most efficient and safe continuation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**UP** is the optimal move. It is safe, moves towards the nearest cluster of apples, and maintains good board position.\n\nUP",

Moving UP captures the apple, grows the snake (delaying the tail movement, which is crucial for safety), and increases the score to 5, matching the enemy.

The move **UP** captures this apple immediately. This is the most efficient move. Capturing the apple will grow my snake, which means my tail will stay in place this turn, effectively blocking the cell (2, 3) (the current tail) for one more turn. However, since the cell immediately behind my head (2, 6) is occupied by my body, I must not move DOWN. Moving UP is the only direction that gains points and moves towards a goal.\n\nMy strategy is to close the score gap immediately while keeping the path open. After eating this apple, my head will be at (2, 8) and my body will extend to (2, 7) (current head). My tail will remain at (2, 3) for this turn. This sets up a potential move to (2, 9) next turn if I survive the enemy's move.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

Staying on the edge is generally safer and maintains the \"open\" feel of the board.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (Target: (3, 8)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (3, 8) appears empty.\n    *   **Utility:** Also safe, but similar to LEFT, it deviates from the optimal vertical path.\n\n4.  **DOWN (Target: (2, 7)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** My body is at (2, 7).\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH** (Self-collision).\n\n**Decision**\n\nI am at (2, 8), the head of a long vertical snake. My immediate rear is (2, 7), making DOWN fatal. Moving LEFT or RIGHT is safe but suboptimal compared to moving UP. Moving UP to (2, 9) places me on the top edge, effectively boxing me in on one side. This is a good defensive position because it removes one direction of attack and allows me to focus on the remaining three directions.\n\n**Long-term Plan**\nContinue traversing the top row (y=9) from left to right (increasing x). This creates a \"high-line\" strategy that keeps me away from the central clutter where the enemy snake (Snake #0) is active. Watch out for any apples appearing on the top row or in the upper-left corner. If the path becomes blocked, I will need to plan a safe descent back into the board, but for now, maintaining height is key.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of the Current State**\n\n*   **Turn:** 15 / 150.\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (2, 9). Body: [(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4)]. Note: I grew on turn 14, so the tail is at (2, 4) (or maybe (2, 3) if I count incorrectly, but the board shows `T` at (2, 4) and `T` at (2, 5). Actually, the board shows `T` at (2,4). Wait, the board shows `1` at (2,9) and `T` at (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). So the tail is at (2,4).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (8, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)]. This snake has 6 apples, so length is 7.\n*   **Apples:** (1, 0), (5, 0), (1, 4), (5, 1), (8, 9).\n\n**Move Evaluation**\n\n1.  **UP (Target: (2, 10)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Coordinates range from 0 to 9. Moving UP to (2, 10) is outside the board.\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH** (Wall collision).\n\n2.  **LEFT (Target: (1, 9)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Board shows `.` at (1, 9). In the string for row 9: `. . 1 . . . . . A .` which corresponds to x=0 to 9. At x=1, it's a space (empty).\n    *   **Safety:** My body is at (2,9), (2,8)... so (1,9) is clear. The only other snake is far away at x=8. This move is safe.\n    *   **Utility:** Keeps me on the top row (y=9), which is a generally safe \"high line\". There is an apple at (8, 9), which is 7 steps to the right. If I go LEFT, I move away from that apple. There is an apple at (1, 4) which is nearby, but accessing it requires moving DOWN eventually.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (Target: (3, 9)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Board shows `.` at (3, 9). In row 9: ` . 1 . . . . . A .`. Yes, empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Moving into open space.\n    *   **Utility:** Moves me closer to the apple at (8, 9). However, I need to be careful about getting trapped. Moving RIGHT takes me towards the center of the board.\n\n4.  **DOWN (Target: (2, 8)):**\n    *   **Board Check:** My body is at (2, 8).\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH** (Self-collision).\n\n**Decision**\n\nI am currently at (2, 9). I cannot go UP or DOWN. I can only go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nComparing LEFT and RIGHT:\n*   **LEFT:** Moves me away from the only top-row apple (at 8,9) and towards the corner (0,9). The corner (0,9) is a dangerous dead-end if I go too far. Moving LEFT increases the distance to (8,9) from 7 to 8.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves me towards the apple at (8,9). It also keeps me closer to the apple at (1,4) and (5,1), although those require a descent. Moving RIGHT into the board keeps my escape routes more open than boxing myself into the left wall.\n\nHowever, I must also consider the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,8). If I go RIGHT to (3,9), I am on a collision course for (8,9) eventually. But the enemy is at (8,8), directly below the apple at (8,9). The enemy cannot get to (8,9) in one move (needs 4 RIGHT moves, assuming no obstacles). Actually, the enemy is at (8,8). To get to (8,9), it would need to go UP. If it goes UP, it will be at (8,9). If I go RIGHT to (3,9), I am not threatening (8,9) immediately.\n\nWait, let's look at the enemy position again. Head (8,8). Body follows. The enemy is very close to the apple at (8,9). The enemy has 6 apples. If the enemy eats that apple, it gets to 7. I have 5. I need to catch up.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I maintain the possibility of reaching the top apple later. If I go LEFT, I give up on the top apple completely and commit to the left side. The left side has an apple at (1, 4). The path (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (1,8) -> ... -> (1,4) seems viable.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"High Line\" strategy from the previous turn.\nPrevious turn I was at (2,8), moved UP to (2,9).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (1,9). From (1,9), I can go DOWN to (1,8), etc. But (1,9) is very close to the left wall.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (3,9). From (3,9), I can go DOWN to (3,8), etc.\n\nActually, I should check if I can safely go LEFT.\nIs there an apple at (0,9)? No.\nIs there an apple at (1,9)? No.\nIs there an apple at (0,8)? No.\nThe nearest apple on the left side is (1,4). Distance is Manhattan distance |3-1| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7.\nThe nearest apple on the right side is (8,9). Distance is |8-3| + |9-9| = 5.\nThe nearest apple below is (5,1). Distance |5-3| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nThe right side apple (8,9) is closer in Manhattan distance, but it requires moving along the top row which is narrow (only one cell wide if I stick to y=9).\nHowever, looking at the board, row 9 has dots at indices 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, let's re-read the board string for row 9:\n`9 . . 1 . . . . . A .`\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: 1 (Me)\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: A\n9: .\n\nSo row 9 is clear from x=3 to x=7. That is a clear path of 5 cells.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), I have a clear shot to (8,9).\nThe enemy is at (8,8). The enemy cannot block me on row 9 because it's on row 8.\nHowever, if the enemy moves UP to (8,9) to eat the apple, it will be there.\nIf I move to (3,9) now, and the enemy moves UP to (8,9), we will both be on row 9.\nIf I continue moving right, and the enemy stays on row 9 or moves right, we might collide.\nBUT, the enemy has a body. Its body goes from (8,7) down to (5,5).\nIf the enemy goes UP to (8,9), its body will follow. The cell (8,8) will become body.\nIf I am at (3,9) and go to (4,9) next turn, I am safe.\n\nActually, I must consider the risk of the enemy intercepting me.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), I am 5 steps away from the apple (8,9).\nThe enemy is at (8,8), 1 step away from the apple (8,9).\nThe enemy will almost certainly move UP to (8,9).\nIf the enemy moves UP, it eats the apple and grows. Its tail won't move for one turn.\nThen the enemy will be at (8,9).\nCan I challenge the enemy for (8,9)?\nNo, the enemy is much closer.\nSo if I go RIGHT, I am committing to a path where the enemy will likely be occupying (8,9) very soon.\n\nWhat about the apple at (1,4)?\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), I am 2 steps away from the apple (1,4) horizontally, and 5 steps vertically. Total 7 steps.\nThe enemy is far away from (1,4). (Distance from (8,8) to (1,4) is 7 + 4 = 11).\nSo (1,4) is much safer for me.\nThe apple at (5,1) is also closer to me than to the enemy (Dist to me: 2+8=10, Dist to enemy: 3+3=6). Actually, the enemy is closer to (5,1) than I am.\n\nSo the choice is:\nLEFT -> Safe apple at (1,4). Moves away from the conflict zone.\nRIGHT -> Unsafe apple at (8,9) (enemy will eat it). Moves towards the enemy.\n\nTherefore, LEFT seems to be the strategically safer choice to collect points.\nHowever, if I go LEFT, I am moving towards the corner. (0,9) is a dead end.\nBut I don't have to go to (0,9). I can go to (1,9) then DOWN to (1,8)...\nRow 1 (x=1) has an apple at (1,0), (1,4).\nColumn x=1: Row 9 is empty. Row 8? Board row 8: `8 . . T . . . . . 0 .` (Wait, index 2 is T). So (1,8) is empty.\nLet's trace the path (2,9) -> (1,9) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4).\nLet's check the board for these positions.\nRow 9: (1,9) is empty.\nRow 8: (1,8) is empty.\nRow 7: (1,7) is empty.\nRow 6: (1,6) is empty.\nRow 5: (1,5) is empty.\nRow 4: (1,4) is Apple.\nThis path is completely empty!\nThis is a very safe and clear path to an apple.\nGoing RIGHT (3,9) -> ... -> (8,9) is also clear, but contested by the enemy.\n\nI should take the safe apple.\nGoing LEFT to (1,9) puts me on the path to (1,4).\nWait, if I go LEFT to (1,9), my tail is at (2,4).\nThe enemy is at (8,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I am safe. The enemy might move UP, RIGHT, LEFT, or DOWN.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8,9), it eats the apple.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7,8), it moves towards the center.\nThe enemy is unlikely to move LEFT into its own body (at (8,7)).\nThe enemy is unlikely to move DOWN into its own body (at (8,7)).\nThe enemy is likely to move UP (to eat) or RIGHT (to wander).\nIf the enemy moves UP, it is safe.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (9,8), that is a wall. Wait, board size 10x10, max index 9. (9,8) is valid.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (9,8), it is safe.\nIt is unlikely the enemy will come to the top-left corner (my position).\n\nSo, LEFT is safe and leads to a guaranteed apple (1,4).\nRIGHT is safe but leads to a contested apple (8,9).\nTherefore, I should go LEFT.\n\nWait, one detail. The board shows `T` at (2,8).\nMy current head is (2,9). My body is (2,8), (2,7)...\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), my head is at (1,9).\nMy body will be (2,9), (2,8), ...\nSo (1,9) is safe.\nMy tail is at (2,4) or (2,3).\nIf I go LEFT, the tail moves (unless I eat an apple). I don't eat an apple this turn.\nSo (2,4) will become empty.\nThis is fine.\n\nOne more check: Is there any apple closer?\nApple at (1,0). Distance from (2,9) is 1 + 9 = 10.\nApple at (5,0). Distance is 3 + 9 = 12.\nApple at (1,4). Distance is 1 + 5 = 6.\nApple at (5,1). Distance is 3 + 8 = 11.\nApple at (8,9). Distance is 6 + 0 = 6.\nDistance to (1,4) is 6. Distance to (8,9) is 6.\nBut (1,4) is much safer.\n(8,9) is contested.\n(1,4) is free.\n\nSo I will go LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any risk in going LEFT?\nThe path to (1,4) is clear.\n(1,9) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4).\nI need to check if the enemy can reach (1,4) before me.\nEnemy head (8,8).\nDistance to (1,4) is |8-1| + |8-4| = 7 + 4 = 11.\nMy distance to (1,4) is 6.\nI will definitely get there first.\nThe only danger is head-on collision.\nIf the enemy moves to intercept me, it has to travel 11 steps. I travel 6.\nI win.\n\nSo, LEFT is the best move.\n\nWait, I should double check the board for Row 9 again.\nRow 9: `9 . . 1 . . . . . A .`\nIndices 0 to 9.\n0: .\n1: .\n2: 1\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: A\n9: .\nSo (1,9) is empty.\n(0,9) is empty.\n(3,9) is empty.\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT are open.\n\nWhy did the previous turn's rationale say \"Continue traversing the top row (y=9) from left to right (increasing x)\"?\nBecause I was at (2,8) and moved UP to (2,9).\nIf I had stayed on the path of \"increasing x\", I would go RIGHT.\nBut that was a generic plan. Now I have specific information about apples and enemy positions.\nThe enemy is at (8,8). The apple is at (8,9).\nThe enemy will eat that apple.\nI should not compete for a lost cause.\nI should secure the apple at (1,4).\n\nIs there any way the enemy could kill me if I go LEFT?\nThe enemy is at (8,8).\nIf the enemy goes UP to (8,9), it is safe.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (7,8), it is safe.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (8,7), it hits its own body.\nIf the enemy goes RIGHT to (9,8), it is safe.\nThe enemy will likely go UP or RIGHT.\nNeither of those puts the enemy near me.\n\nSo, LEFT is safe.\n\nOne final check. Is there an apple at (1,4) or is that a 'T'?\nBoard Row 4: `4 . A T . . . . . . .`\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: A\n2: T\n3: .\nSo (1,4) is A. Correct.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), etc.\nThe enemy is long. Its body is at (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5).\nI am far away.\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\nWait, what about the apple at (5,1)?\nDistance is 3+8=11.\nEnemy distance is |8-5| + |8-1| = 3+7=10.\nEnemy is closer to (5,1) than I am.\nSo (5,1) is not a good target.\n\nWhat about (1,0)?\nI am closer to (1,0) than the enemy is.\nDistance to me: 1+9=10.\nDistance to enemy: 7+8=15.\nBut (1,4) is closer (6 vs 10).\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Go LEFT to (1,9).\n2. Continue DOWN to (1,4).\n3. Eat apple at (1,4).\n4. Then maybe (1,0).\n\nLet's trace the path from (1,4) to (1,0) to be sure.\nRow 3: `3 . . . . . . . . . .` -> (1,3) empty.\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . . . . .` -> (1,2) empty.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . . A . . . .` -> (1,1) empty.\nRow 0: `0 . A . . . A . . . .` -> (1,0) Apple.\nSo the entire column x=1 is empty except for the apple at (1,0) and (1,4).\nThis is a perfect highway.\n\nI am definitely going LEFT.\n\nOne small detail. The enemy has 6 apples. I have 5.\nThe enemy is at (8,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I secure (1,4).\nThe enemy will likely secure (8,9).\nScore will be 6-6.\nThen I need another apple.\nThe next apple for me would be (1,0).\nThe next apple for the enemy might be (5,1) or others.\n(5,1) is closer to the enemy.\nSo I need to be fast.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT, I am moving away from the center.\nThe enemy might take the central apples.\nBut the central area is crowded with the enemy's body.\nMy path is safe.\n\nFinal check: Is there any reason to go RIGHT?\nMaybe to block the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (8,8). I am at (2,9).\nI cannot block the enemy effectively.\nIf I go RIGHT, I might meet the enemy at (8,9) or nearby.\nIf I go RIGHT and the enemy goes UP, we might end up fighting on the top row.\nIf I go LEFT, I stay out of the fight.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (1,4)? Yes.\nIs it safe? Yes.\nIs it closer than the other options? (1,4) is distance 6. (8,9) is distance 6. (1,4) is safer.\nIs there an apple at (5,0)? Distance 12.\nIs there an apple at (1,0)? Distance 10.\nIs there an apple at (5,1)? Distance 11.\n\nSo (1,4) and (8,9) are the closest.\n(1,4) is safer.\nI choose LEFT.\n\nWait, I should check if the enemy can move into my path.\nEnemy is at (8,8).\nMy path is x=1.\nEnemy is x=8.\nNo overlap.\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\nOne check on the \"backwards\" rule.\nIf I go LEFT, my head goes to (1,9).\nMy current head is (2,9).\nMy next body segment is (2,8).\n(1,9) is not (2,8). So it's not backwards.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne more check.\nThe board state shows:\nRow 9: `. . 1 . . . . . A .`\nRow 8: `. . T . . . . . 0 .`\nWait, look at Row 8 carefully.\n`8 . . T . . . . . 0 .`\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: T\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: 0\n9: .\nSo (2,8) is T. (My body).\n(8,8) is 0. (Enemy head).\nSo (1,8) is empty. (0,8) is empty.\nSo if I go LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8), I am safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (7,8) (LEFT)?\nThen it is at (7,8).\nIf I go to (1,9) and then (1,8), I am safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (9,8) (RIGHT)?\nThen it is at (9,8).\nI am safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves UP to (8,9)?\nThen it is at (8,9).\nI am at (1,9).\nI am safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN to (8,7)?\nThat hits its own body.\nWait, body at (8,7).\nSo enemy cannot go DOWN.\n\nSo the enemy can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\nNone of these threaten me if I go LEFT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), and the enemy goes UP to (8,9), I am safe.\nBut if the enemy goes UP, it eats the apple.\nIf the enemy goes UP, it grows.\nIf I go RIGHT, and eventually try to get that apple, the enemy might be blocking.\nIf the enemy goes UP, its body will extend to (8,8).\nThen the enemy might chase me.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am in a safe zone.\nI get the apple at (1,4).\nI get the apple at (1,0).\nI can then cross the bottom to other apples.\nThe enemy is stuck in the top-right.\n\nSo LEFT is the correct strategic play.\n\nFinal confirmation:\nCoordinates (1,9) are valid (0-9).\n(1,9) is empty (board check).\n(1,9) is not my body (my body is x=2).\n(1,9) is not enemy body (enemy is x=5-8).\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nI will output LEFT.\n\nWait, I need to write the plan.\nLong-term plan: Secure the apple at (1,4). Then the apple at (1,0). Maintain the left column as a safe highway. Avoid confrontation with snake 0 who is likely moving to (8,9) and staying in the right side.\n\nMove: LEFT.\nReasoning:\n1.  Eliminate UP (wall) and DOWN (self).\n2.  Compare LEFT and RIGHT.\n3.  LEFT leads to a safe, clear path to apple (1,4) in the left column.\n4.  RIGHT leads to a contested apple (8,9) where the enemy (snake 0) is located.\n5.  Choosing LEFT maximizes safety and points accumulation.\n\nDecision: LEFT.**Strategy Note:**\nSecure the safe apple at (1,4) by moving into the clear left column. Avoid the right side where Snake #0 is competing for the apple at (8,9). After eating (1,4), proceed to (1,0) to chain apples efficiently.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n*   **UP:** Moves to (2, 10), which is off the board. **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (2, 8), which is occupied by my current body. **DEATH.**\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (3, 9). This is empty and safe, but moves towards Snake #0's position (8, 8) and the contested apple at (8, 9).\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (1, 9). This is empty and safe. It positions me in the left column, which is completely clear of obstacles leading down to the apple at (1, 4) and (1, 0). This is the safest option that also guarantees a point.\n\nLEFT",

T . . . . 0 T .`\nAt `x=0` is '1' (my head).\nAt `x=1` is '.' (empty).\nAt `x=2` is 'T' (my body? No, let me re-read my body).\nMy body is: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nLet's trace the board again.\nRow 9: `9 T T T . . . . T T .`\nRow 8: `8 1 . T . . . . 0 T .`\nRow 7: `7 . . T . . . . . T .`\n\nMy head is (0, 8).\nMy body includes (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7).\nEnemy #0 head is (7, 8).\n\nLet's check the moves again carefully.\n**UP to (0, 9)**:\nBoard state at (0, 9) is 'T'. My body includes (0, 9).\nSo, **UP = DEATH**.\n\n**DOWN to (0, 7)**:\nBoard state at (0, 7) is '.'.\nMy body does not include (0, 7).\nEnemy #0 body does not include (0, 7).\nSo, **DOWN = SAFE**.\n\n**LEFT to (-1, 8)**:\nOff board. **DEATH**.\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 8)**:\nBoard state at (1, 8) is '.'.\nMy body does not include (1, 8).\nEnemy #0 body does not include (1, 8).\nSo, **RIGHT = SAFE**.\n\nCurrent valid moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the board state at row 8: `8 1 . T . . . . 0 T .`\n- 1 is my head at (0, 8).\n- . is empty at (1, 8).\n- T is my body at (2, 8).\n- ... is empty.\n- 0 is enemy head at (7, 8).\n- T is enemy body at (8, 8).\n- . is empty at (9, 8).\n\nNow I need to decide between DOWN and RIGHT.\nTarget apples: (1, 0), (5, 0), (1, 4), (5, 1), (1, 3).\nMy current position: (0, 8).\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (1, 8)**\n- Moves me towards apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0).\n- From (1, 8), I can go DOWN to (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\n- Let's check the column x=1.\n  - y=9: (1, 9) is my body.\n  - y=8: (1, 8) is target.\n  - y=7: (1, 7) is empty.\n  - y=6: (1, 6) is empty.\n  - y=5: (1, 5) is empty.\n  - y=4: (1, 4) is Apple.\n- So the path DOWN from (1, 8) is clear.\n- However, I need to be careful about the tail.\n- My tail is at (2, 7).\n- If I move RIGHT to (1, 8), my new body will be: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\n- Wait, the snake grows only if it eats an apple. I am not eating an apple this turn (apples are at y=0, 1, 3, 4, 0).\n- So the tail moves forward? No, in standard snake mechanics, if you don't eat, the tail moves to where the segment before it was.\n- Current tail is (2, 7). The segment before it is (2, 8).\n- So if I move RIGHT, the tail will move to (2, 8)? No, let's look at the body list.\n- Current body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\n- New head: (1, 8).\n- New body (if not eating): [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\n- The old tail (2, 7) becomes empty.\n- Is (1, 8) safe? Yes.\n- Is (2, 8) safe for the body? Yes, it's part of my body. Wait, if I move, the tail moves to where the body currently is.\n- The new tail is (2, 8). The cell (2, 8) is currently occupied by my body (specifically, the segment before the tail). This is fine. The tail moves *into* the space vacated by the rest of the body.\n- Wait, let's re-read the rules. \"If you move into any snake's body... you die.\"\n- My head moves to (1, 8).\n- The body follows.\n- The tail leaves (2, 7).\n- So (1, 8) is safe.\n- The path down from (1, 8) goes through (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4).\n- (1, 7) is currently empty ('.' in row 7).\n- (1, 6) is empty.\n- (1, 5) is empty.\n- (1, 4) is Apple.\n- So the path is clear.\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (0, 7)**\n- Moves me towards apples at (5, 0), (5, 1) and (1, 0) via the bottom.\n- From (0, 7), I can go DOWN to (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0).\n- Then RIGHT to (1, 0), (5, 0) etc.\n- Check column x=0.\n  - y=9: (0, 9) is my body.\n  - y=8: (0, 8) is my head (moving to y=7).\n  - y=7: (0, 7) is target.\n  - y=6: (0, 6) is empty.\n  - y=5: (0, 5) is empty.\n  - y=4: (0, 4) is empty.\n  - y=3: (0, 3) is empty.\n  - y=2: (0, 2) is empty.\n  - y=1: (0, 1) is empty.\n  - y=0: (0, 0) is empty.\n- So the path DOWN is clear.\n- If I go DOWN, new body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\n- Tail moves to (2, 8).\n- (0, 7) is safe.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Current Score: 5 apples.\n- Enemy Score: 7 apples.\n- Apples on board: 5.\n- I need to catch up.\n- Apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (5, 1), (1, 0), (5, 0).\n- (1, 4) and (1, 3) are in the same column as my current x=0 (or close).\n- (1, 0) and (5, 0) are at the bottom.\n\nLet's look at the enemy snake.\nHead: (7, 8).\nBody: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\nNearest apple to enemy is (5, 0) or (5, 1) or (1, 0).\nWait, the enemy is at y=8.\nEnemy has 7 apples. I have 5.\nI need to prioritize speed to catch up.\n\nLet's calculate moves to nearest apples.\nMy current pos: (0, 8).\nApple (1, 4): Distance = |0-1| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves.\nApple (1, 3): Distance = 1 + 5 = 6 moves.\nApple (1, 0): Distance = 1 + 8 = 9 moves.\nApple (5, 0): Distance = 5 + 8 = 13 moves.\nApple (5, 1): Distance = 5 + 7 = 12 moves.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (1, 8):\n- Distance to (1, 4) becomes |1-1| + |8-4| = 4 moves.\n- Path: (1, 8) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\n- Let's check if (1, 7) is safe.\n- Board row 7: `7 . . T . . . . . T .`\n- (1, 7) is '.'.\n- Board row 6: `6 . . . . . . . T T .`\n- (1, 6) is '.'.\n- Board row 5: `5 . . . . . . . T . .`\n- (1, 5) is '.'.\n- Board row 4: `4 . A . . . . . . . .`\n- (1, 4) is 'A'.\n- All safe.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (0, 7):\n- I am moving away from (1, 4).\n- Distance to (1, 4) becomes |0-1| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 moves.\n- Path: (0, 7) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (1, 4).\n- Let's check safety.\n- (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4) are empty.\n- (1, 4) is Apple.\n- Also safe.\n\nSo both paths seem viable to get to (1, 4).\nHowever, going RIGHT puts me directly on the column of the apples (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0).\nGoing DOWN puts me on the edge (x=0).\nIf I go DOWN, I have to turn RIGHT eventually to get apples at (1, 4) or (5, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I stay in the interior (x=1).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `8 1 . T . . . . 0 T .`\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), I am between my head and the enemy head.\nMy head is (0, 8).\nEnemy head is (7, 8).\nThere is a clear path between them.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), I am below my head.\n\nLet's consider the enemy's move.\nEnemy is at (7, 8).\nApples near enemy:\n- (5, 1): Distance 2+7=9.\n- (5, 0): Distance 2+8=10.\n- (1, 0): Distance 6+8=14.\n- (1, 4): Distance 6+4=10.\n- (1, 3): Distance 6+5=11.\n\nWait, apples are at:\n(1, 0)\n(5, 0)\n(1, 4)\n(5, 1)\n(1, 3)\n\nLet's calculate enemy distance to (5, 1).\nEnemy (7, 8) to (5, 1): |7-5| + |8-1| = 2 + 7 = 9 moves.\nDistance to (5, 0): 2 + 8 = 10.\nDistance to (1, 4): 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nI am at (0, 8).\nDistance to (1, 4): 1 + 4 = 5.\nDistance to (1, 3): 1 + 5 = 6.\nDistance to (1, 0): 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nI am much closer to the top-left apples than the enemy is to the top-right apples.\nI should grab (1, 4) and (1, 3).\nAfter eating (1, 4), I will grow.\nMy body will extend.\nThe apples are at (1, 4) and (1, 3).\nIf I eat (1, 4), I will be at (1, 4). My tail will move from (2, 7) to (2, 8) (assuming I haven't moved much else).\nWait, let's simulate the \"RIGHT\" path.\nTurn 18: Move RIGHT to (1, 8).\nTurn 19: Move DOWN to (1, 7).\nTurn 20: Move DOWN to (1, 6).\nTurn 21: Move DOWN to (1, 5).\nTurn 22: Move DOWN to (1, 4). **EAT APPLE**.\nNew length: 7 (currently 6).\nNew head: (1, 4).\nNew tail: (2, 8) (previous tail was (2, 7) which was vacated, so new tail is the segment before it).\n\nLet's check for traps.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), I am at (1, 8).\nMy body will be: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nWait, my body was length 6.\nHead: (0, 8)\nBody: (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7).\nTotal: 6 segments.\nIf I move to (1, 8):\nNew Head: (1, 8)\nBody: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7).\nNew Tail: (2, 7).\nWait, the rule is \"the first tuple is the head\".\nCurrent: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nIf I move RIGHT:\nNew: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)]? No.\nIf I don't eat:\nNew: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\nThe tail (2, 7) is removed.\nSo the body occupies (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nMy head is at (1, 8).\nIs (1, 8) safe? Yes.\nIs (1, 9) occupied? Yes, by body.\nIs (0, 8) occupied? Yes, by body.\nIs (0, 7) occupied? No.\nIs (1, 7) occupied? No.\nIs (2, 8) occupied? Yes, by body.\n\nNow consider the enemy.\nEnemy head: (7, 8).\nEnemy body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\nEnemy length 8.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), I am moving closer to the center.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), I am staying on the edge.\nWhich is safer long term?\nThe edge can be a trap if I get pinned.\nThe center offers more flexibility.\nBut the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 3) are near the top.\n(1, 4) is at y=4.\n(1, 3) is at y=3.\nMy current y=8.\nGoing DOWN takes me away from y=4.\nGoing RIGHT keeps me at y=8, ready to go DOWN towards y=4.\n\nLet's re-verify the coordinates.\nThe board is 10x10. 0 to 9.\ny=0 is bottom.\ny=9 is top.\nI am at (0, 8). y=8 is near the top.\nApples at y=4, y=3, y=1, y=0.\nI need to go DOWN to get to them.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), I can immediately start going DOWN next turn.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), I can go DOWN again to (0, 6) etc.\nHowever, if I go DOWN to (0, 7), I am stuck on the left edge.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), I can access column 1.\nColumn 1 has apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0).\nThis is a clear path.\n\nLet's check the immediate safety of RIGHT.\nTarget: (1, 8).\nOccupied by: Nothing.\nMy body will be: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\nWait, my body currently is [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nSo the list is Head (0, 8), then the body.\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (0, 8), Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)]\"\nThis implies the full list is [ (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7) ].\nTotal length: 6.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8) (no apple there):\nNew Head: (1, 8)\nNew Body: [ (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8) ] (tail (2, 7) removed).\nOccupied cells: (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nCheck collisions:\n- (1, 8) is my head.\n- (0, 8) is body.\n- (0, 9) is body.\n- (1, 9) is body.\n- (2, 9) is body.\n- (2, 8) is body.\nAre there any other snakes?\nEnemy #0 at (7, 8). Body at (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5).\nNone of these overlap with my new positions.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7) (no apple there):\nNew Head: (0, 7)\nNew Body: [ (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8) ] (tail (2, 7) removed).\nOccupied: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nSafety check: All good. No enemy overlap.\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nStrategy:\nI need apples. The nearest are at (1, 4) and (1, 3).\nTo reach them efficiently, I should be in column 1.\nGoing RIGHT puts me in column 1 immediately.\nGoing DOWN keeps me in column 0, requiring a turn later to get to column 1.\nHowever, if I go DOWN now, I might block my own path if I grow too long.\nActually, let's look at the path.\nPath from (0, 8) to (1, 4):\nOption RIGHT: (0,8) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4).\nTotal moves: 5.\nOption DOWN: (0,8) -> (0,7) -> (0,6) -> (0,5) -> (0,4) -> (1,4).\nTotal moves: 5.\n\nDistance is equal.\nHowever, the \"RIGHT\" path puts me in the column of multiple apples (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0).\nThe \"DOWN\" path puts me on the edge.\nEdges are dangerous because you can be pinned.\nAlso, the enemy is at x=7.\nI am at x=0.\nThe apples at (5, 0) and (5, 1) are closer to the enemy.\nThe apples at (1, 4) and (1, 3) are closer to me.\nThe apple at (1, 0) is equidistant or slightly closer to me (distance 9 vs enemy distance 14).\n\nI should secure the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 3) first.\nTo do that, I need to be able to move DOWN.\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 8) allows me to go DOWN to (1, 7) next.\nMoving DOWN to (0, 7) allows me to go DOWN to (0, 6) next.\nIf I am at (0, 7), and I want to go to (1, 4), I have to turn right at some point.\nIf I am at (1, 8), I can just go straight down.\n\nLet's check if there are any immediate threats.\nEnemy #0 at (7, 8).\nEnemy has 7 apples. I have 5.\nEnemy has a body length of 8.\nIf the enemy moves UP, it dies (off board).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, to (7, 7).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, to (6, 8).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, to (8, 8).\n(8, 8) is occupied by enemy body (since body includes (8, 8)? No, wait.\nEnemy body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\nSo (8, 8) is occupied by enemy body.\nSo Enemy cannot go RIGHT.\nIf Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 8).\nIs (6, 8) occupied? Board row 8: `8 1 . T . . . . 0 T .`\nIndices: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n(6, 8) is '.'. Empty.\nSo Enemy can go LEFT.\n\nWhat about head-on collision?\nMy head (0, 8).\nEnemy head (7, 8).\nDistance is large. We can't collide.\n\nWhat if I go RIGHT to (1, 8) and Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 8)? No interaction.\nWhat if I go DOWN to (0, 7) and Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 8)? No interaction.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer DOWN?\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), my body fills (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nThis forms a wall on the left.\nIf I later want to turn around or maneuver, I am trapped on the left wall.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), my body fills (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nThis is the same configuration, just shifted right by 1.\nWait, if I go RIGHT:\nHead: (1, 8)\nBody: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\nIf I go DOWN:\nHead: (0, 7)\nBody: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8).\n\nIn the RIGHT case, I have a \"hook\" shape.\nIn the DOWN case, I have a \"vertical line\" on the left edge.\nThe RIGHT case allows me to move to (1, 7).\n(1, 7) is empty.\nIf I move to (1, 7), my body will be:\nHead: (1, 7)\nBody: (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9).\nNow I am at (1, 7).\nFrom here I can go DOWN to (1, 6).\n(1, 6) is empty.\nBody: (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9).\nFrom here I can go DOWN to (1, 5).\n(1, 5) is empty.\nBody: (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9).\nFrom here I can go DOWN to (1, 4).\n(1, 4) is Apple.\nEAT.\nBody grows.

No apple. Tail (2, 7) drops. Body: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\nTurn 19: Move DOWN to (1, 7). No apple. Tail (2, 8) drops. Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\nTurn 20: Move DOWN to (1, 6). No apple. Tail (2, 9) drops. Body: [(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)].\nTurn 21: Move DOWN to (1, 5). No apple. Tail (1, 9) drops. Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\nTurn 22: Move DOWN to (1, 4). **APPLE**. Keep tail (0, 9). Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\n\nNow check safety of this path.\nTurn 19: (1, 7) is empty.\nTurn 20: (1, 6) is empty.\nTurn 21: (1, 5) is empty.\nTurn 22: (1, 4) is Apple.\n\nCheck for enemy interference.\nEnemy at (7, 8).\nIf enemy moves towards the bottom right apples, no problem.\nIf enemy moves towards me? Unlikely, I am far away.\n\nWhat if I choose DOWN now?\nTurn 18: DOWN to (0, 7).\nTurn 19: DOWN to (0, 6).\nTurn 20: DOWN to (0, 5).\nTurn 21: DOWN to (0, 4).\nTurn 22: RIGHT to (1, 4). **APPLE**.\nThis path is also clear.\nHowever, at turn 21, I am at (0, 4).\nTurn 22: RIGHT to (1, 4).\nIf I am at (0, 4), I am on the left edge.\nIf I ate any apples along the way (there are none in col 0), I would be growing.\nThe apples in col 0 are at (0, 0). Very far.\n\nComparing the two paths:\nPath A (RIGHT now): Ends at (1, 4) with body [(1, 4), ...]. Positioned in the column of apples (1,4), (1,3), (1,0).\nPath B (DOWN now): Ends at (1, 4) with body [(1, 4), ...]. Positioned in the column of apples.\nWait, the final state is roughly similar, but the intermediate states differ.\nPath A keeps me at y=8, 7, 6, 5, 4.\nPath B keeps me at y=7, 6, 5, 4, then moves to x=1.\nIs there any danger in moving RIGHT into column 1?\n(1, 9) is my body.\n(1, 8) is target.\n(1, 7) is empty.\n(1, 6) is empty.\n(1, 5) is empty.\n(1, 4) is apple.\n(1, 3) is apple.\n(1, 2) is empty.\n(1, 1) is empty.\n(1, 0) is apple.\nSo column 1 is mostly empty.\nThe only blockage is (1, 9), which is my own body.\nBut as I move down, I will eventually leave (1, 9) behind.\nTurn 18: Head (1, 8). Body includes (1, 9).\nTurn 19: Head (1, 7). Body includes (1, 8). (1, 9) is still in body? Yes.\nTurn 20: Head (1, 6). Body includes (1, 7), (1, 8). (1, 9) is still in body? Yes.\nTurn 21: Head (1, 5). Body includes (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8). (1, 9) is still in body? Yes.\nTurn 22: Head (1, 4). Body includes (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8).\nWait, when does (1, 9) get dropped?\nAt Turn 18, body is [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\nAt Turn 19, body is [(1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\nAt Turn 20, body is [(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)].\nAt Turn 21, body is [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\nAt Turn 22 (Eating), body is [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\nSo (1, 9) is dropped at Turn 21.\nAt Turn 21, I am at (1, 5).\nSo I need to be sure (1, 5) is not occupied by (1, 9).\nBut (1, 5) is empty.\n(1, 9) is far away (y=9).\nSo the path is safe.\n\nThe only concern is if the enemy moves to block me. But the enemy is at x=7, y=8. It would take the enemy many turns to reach me.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to start the descent into column 1.\n\nWait, let me double check the \"Last Move\" info.\nLast move was DOWN.\nMy head was at (0, 8).\nSo previous head was (0, 7).\nBefore that (0, 6).\nSo I have been moving UP? No, y increases as UP.\nWait, coordinates: (0, 0) bottom left. (9, 9) top right.\nSo UP increases Y. DOWN decreases Y.\nIf my head is at (0, 8) and I went DOWN to get here from (0, 9), that would be decreasing Y.\nBut the last move was DOWN.\nIf last move was DOWN to (0, 8), then previous position was (0, 9).\nLet's check the body.\nBody: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nSo yes, (0, 9) is the neck.\nSo I came from (0, 9).\n(0, 9) is at the top.\nSo I moved DOWN from (0, 9) to (0, 8).\nThis matches the \"Last Move: DOWN\".\n\nSo I am moving down the left edge.\nNow I have to decide where to go.\nLeft edge is risky.\nI should turn into the board.\nMoving RIGHT puts me into the board.\nMoving DOWN keeps me on the edge.\n\nIf I keep moving DOWN, I will eventually hit the bottom.\nThen I have to turn right.\nIf I turn right now, I can start collecting the apples in column 1.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (1, 4).\nMy current pos (0, 8).\nDistance to (1, 4) is 5 turns.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), distance is still 5 turns (via (0,4) -> (1,4)).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), distance is 4 turns? No, (1,8)->(1,7)->(1,6)->(1,5)->(1,4).\nThat's 4 moves.\nWait, (1, 4) is at y=4.\nI am at y=8.\nDifference is 4.\nSo (1, 8) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\nYes, 4 moves.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7):\n(0, 7) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (1, 4).\nAlso 4 moves.\nWait, (0, 7) is y=7.\nTarget y=4. Diff 3.\n(0, 7)->(0, 6)->(0, 5)->(0, 4) is 3 moves.\nThen (0, 4)->(1, 4) is 1 move.\nTotal 4 moves.\n\nSo both are equal distance.\nHowever, the RIGHT path gets me to the apples (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0) in a straight line.\nThe DOWN path gets me to (1, 4), but then I have to deal with my body being on the left edge.\nIf I go DOWN, I will eventually be long and stacked on the left.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am spreading out.\n\nLet's consider the immediate next turn after this move.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8):\nNext turn I can move DOWN to (1, 7).\n(1, 7) is empty.\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7):\nNext turn I can move DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7).\n(1, 7) is empty.\n(0, 6) is empty.\n\nIs there any apple I can get sooner?\nApple (1, 4) is the closest.\nApple (5, 0) is far.\nApple (1, 0) is far.\n\nThe prompt strategy note says: \"Target the two apples at (1, 0) and (5, 0) on the bottom row.\"\nAnd \"Currently at (1, 9), the most direct path is to go DOWN.\"\nWait, the prompt says my head is at (0, 8). The strategy note says \"Currently at (1, 9)\".\nThis note is from the *previous* turn.\nIn the previous turn, my head was at (0, 9)? No.\nLet's re-read the \"My snake\" section.\nHead: (0, 8).\nBody: [(0, 9), (1, 9), ...]\nSo previous head was (0, 9).\nSo the strategy note \"Currently at (1, 9)\" is wrong about my position, or it refers to a different state?\nAh, the strategy note is part of the \"Last Move Info\".\n\"Strategy Note: ... Currently at (1, 9) ... Target the two apples at (1, 0) and (5, 0) ... Move Analysis: ... DOWN to (1, 8).\"\nWait, if the previous head was (1, 9), then moving DOWN would go to (1, 8).\nBut my current head is (0, 8).\nThis implies that the previous move was NOT down from (1, 9) to (1, 8).\nWait.\nIf I was at (1, 9) and went DOWN, I'd be at (1, 8).\nBut I am at (0, 8).\nSo the history is:\nTurn 17: Head (0, 9).\nTurn 18: Head (0, 8).\nLast move was DOWN.\nThis matches.\nSo the \"Last Move Info\" provided in the prompt seems disconnected from the actual board state?\nOr maybe the \"Last Move Info\" is just an example of what I *should* do?\n\"**START LAST MOVE PICK** DOWN **END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\nThis was the move I chose.\n\"**START LAST RATIONALE** ... Currently at (1, 9) ... Move to (1, 8).\"\nThis rationale assumes I was at (1, 9).\nBut I am at (0, 8).\nThis means the \"Last Rationale\" provided in the prompt is *hypothetical* or *from a different game*?\nNo, usually these prompts simulate a history.\nIf the prompt says \"Your snake ... Head: (0, 8)\" and \"Last move ... DOWN\", then I must have been at (0, 9) before.\nSo the provided Rationale text (\"Currently at (1, 9)\") is incorrect for this specific instance.\nI must ignore the specific text of the rationale and trust the board state.\nThe board state is the ground truth.\nBoard state shows head at (0, 8).\nBody includes (0, 9).\nSo previous position was (0, 9).\nLast move was DOWN. (0, 9) to (0, 8) is DOWN.\nThis is consistent.\n\nSo, current state: (0, 8).\nPath options: RIGHT vs DOWN.\nRIGHT goes to (1, 8).\nDOWN goes to (0, 7).\n\nWhich is better for getting apples?\nThe apples are at (1, 0), (5, 0), (1, 4), (5, 1), (1, 3).\nI am at (0, 8).\n(1, 4) and (1, 3) are \"close\" (distance 4-5).\nTo reach them, I need to be in column 1.\nMoving RIGHT puts me in column 1 immediately.\nMoving DOWN keeps me in column 0.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), I will likely have to go DOWN to (0, 6) ... (0, 0) and then RIGHT.\nOr turn RIGHT at some point.\nIf I turn RIGHT at (0, 7), I go to (1, 7).\nIf I turn RIGHT at (0, 6), I go to (1, 6).\n...\nThis creates a \"staircase\" path.\nThe \"RIGHT\" move is the first step of that staircase.\n\nLet's check for enemy movement.\nEnemy #0 at (7, 8).\nApple (5, 1) is close to enemy.\nApple (5, 0) is close to enemy.\nThe enemy will likely go DOWN or LEFT to get these.\nI should not worry about the enemy blocking me.\n\nWhat if the enemy goes LEFT?\nDistance from (7, 8) to (0, 8) is 7 moves.\nMy length is 6.\nIf the enemy moves left, it won't reach me in one turn.\n\nIs there any trap in column 1?\n(1, 9) is my body.\n(1, 8) is target.\n(1, 7) is empty.\n(1, 6) is empty.\n(1, 5) is empty.\n(1, 4) is apple.\n(1, 3) is apple.\n(1, 2) is empty.\n(1, 1) is empty.\n(1, 0) is apple.\nSeems clear.\n\nIs there a trap in column 0?\n(0, 9) is body.\n(0, 8) is head.\n(0, 7) is empty.\n...\n(0, 0) is empty.\nAlso clear.\n\nHowever, column 0 leads to (0, 0) which is a dead end if I don't turn right.\nColumn 1 leads to (1, 0) which is an apple.\nActually, (1, 0) is an apple.\nIf I am in column 1, I can go all the way down to (1, 0).\nIf I am in column 0, I have to go to (0, 0) then turn right to (1, 0).\nBut (0, 0) is empty.\nSo both paths allow reaching (1, 0).\n\nHowever, (1, 4) and (1, 3) are in column 1.\n(5, 0) and (5, 1) are in column 5.\nColumn 1 is closer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1.  Move to column 1 (RIGHT).\n2.  Go DOWN to (1, 4), eat apple.\n3.  Go DOWN to (1, 3), eat apple.\n4.  Go DOWN to (1, 0), eat apple.\n\nLet's verify the safety of \"RIGHT\" one more time.\nTarget (1, 8).\nIs it occupied?\nBoard row 8: `8 1 . T . . . . 0 T .`\n(1, 8) is '.'.\nMy body will not occupy it yet.\nSo it's empty.\nIs it within bounds? Yes (0-9).\nDoes it hit my body? No.\nDoes it hit enemy body? No.\n\nFinal check: The \"Last Move Info\" strategy note said to target (1, 0) and (5, 0).\nIt said \"Currently at (1, 9)\".\nIf I was at (1, 9), I would go DOWN to (1, 8).\nI am at (0, 8).\nTo follow that strategy (going to column 1), I should go RIGHT to (1, 8).\nThis aligns with the strategy of targeting column 1 apples.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), I am abandoning the column 1 apples for now, or taking a detour.\nGoing RIGHT is the most direct way to get to the apples at x=1.\n\nLet's consider if \"LEFT\" or \"UP\" are possible.\nUP: (0, 9) is body. DEATH.\nLEFT: (-1, 8) is off board. DEATH.\nSo only RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, RIGHT puts me in the column with the most apples (x=1 has 3 apples: (1,4), (1,3), (1,0)).\nDOWN puts me on the edge.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nStrategy Note for next turn:\nMove DOWN to (1, 7). Continue descending towards apples at (1, 4) and (1, 3). Keep an eye on the tail to ensure it doesn't block the path if I grow.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

Last move was RIGHT.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate immediate survival risks.**\n*   **Enemy #0:** Head at (6, 7). Body at [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n    *   Distance: $|6-2| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5$ turns. Safe.\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (1, 0), (5, 0), (1, 4), (5, 1), (1, 3).\n*   **Board Boundaries:** 0 to 9.\n\n**Step 2: Check potential moves from (2, 8).**\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Blocked by my own body (tail). **Deadly.**\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):**\n    *   Is it safe? Cell (2, 7) is empty on the board.\n    *   Body check: My body is at (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9). (2, 7) is clear.\n    *   Backwards? Last move was RIGHT. DOWN is not backwards.\n    *   **Result: Safe.**\n    *   Apple? No.\n*   **LEFT (1, 8):**\n    *   Is it safe? Cell (1, 8) is empty on the board.\n    *   Body check: (1, 8) is *not* in my body list (wait, looking at my body list: `[(1, 8), (0, 8)...]`). **AH!** My body list explicitly says `Head: (2, 8), Body: [(1, 8), ...]`. So (1, 8) is currently my second segment.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1, 8), I move into my own body.\n    *   **Result: Deadly.**\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):**\n    *   Is it safe? Cell (3, 8) is empty on the board.\n    *   Body check: (3, 8) is not in my body.\n    *   Backwards? Last move was RIGHT. RIGHT is same direction, so not backwards.\n    *   **Result: Safe.**\n    *   Apple? No.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Evaluation (Between DOWN and RIGHT).**\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (2, 7).**\n    *   Position: (2, 7).\n    *   Future: I can turn left towards column 1 apples or right towards column 5 apples. This keeps options open.\n    *   Goal alignment: My last rationale mentioned targeting (1, 4) and (1, 3). Moving DOWN puts me closer to (2, 7), from which I can go LEFT to (1, 7) next turn. This effectively sets up the path to column 1.\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (3, 8).**\n    *   Position: (3, 8).\n    *   Goal alignment: Moving right takes me away from the column 1 apples mentioned in my plan. It pushes me towards the center/right side.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMy stated goal is to target the apples in column 1. Moving **DOWN** is the correct move to align with this path. It allows me to turn left next turn (to 1, 7) and begin the descent. Moving RIGHT would deviate from the plan and make the path to column 1 longer. Both moves are safe, but DOWN aligns with the strategic goal.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 7). Descend column 1. Monitor enemy #0 for potential interference, though currently safe.\n\nDOWN",

Body segments at (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8).\n2.  **Board State**: There is a \"T\" (Snake #0's tail) at (2, 7) and (1, 7). The board representation shows \"T\" at (1, 6) as well, which matches the location of Snake #0's tail segment based on the provided body coordinates. Wait, let me re-read the board.\n\nBoard:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . T T .\n 8 T T T . . . . T . .\n 7 . T T . . . T T . .\n 6 . 1 . . . . T . . .\n```\nMy head is at (1, 6). The board shows '1' at (1, 6).\nMy body is listed as: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8)].\n- (1, 7): Matches board 'T'.\n- (2, 7): Matches board 'T'.\n- (2, 8): Matches board 'T'.\n- (1, 8): Matches board 'T'.\n- (0, 8): Matches board 'T'.\nSo my body occupies (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8). Correct.\n\nSnake #0 (Enemy):\n- Head: (5, 5)\n- Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]\n- Apples: 7\n\nApples at: (1, 0), (5, 0), (1, 4), (5, 1), (1, 3)\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 6):**\n- **UP (1, 7)**: Occupied by my own body. **DEAD**.\n- **DOWN (1, 5)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT (0, 6)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (2, 6)**: Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThere are apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), and (1, 0) in column 1.\nMy head is currently at (1, 6).\nMoving DOWN gets me closer to the apples at (1, 4) and (1, 3).\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT moves me away from these apples.\nHowever, I must be careful. The enemy snake #0 is at (5, 5). Its body goes up to (6, 7).\nMy current body blocks the path above me.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 5):\n- Next moves from (1, 5) would be (1, 4) (apple), (0, 5), (2, 5).\n- (1, 4) is an apple.\n- (1, 3) is an apple below that.\n- (1, 0) is an apple even lower.\nThis looks like a good cluster to pursue.\n\nLet's check for potential head-on collisions.\nEnemy #0 is at (5, 5). He might move towards apples at (5, 0) or (5, 1).\nI am at (1, 6).\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 5), I am safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 6), I am safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 6), I am safe.\n\nLong term plan:\nCollect apples in column 1.\nFrom (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0).\nWait, there is an apple at (1, 0) but also (5, 0) and (5, 1).\nEnemy snake is at (5, 5). He has apples directly below him at (5, 1) and (5, 0).\nHe will likely go down to get those.\nI should focus on the column 1 apples to avoid conflict.\n\nLet's confirm safety of DOWN.\nTarget (1, 5). Is it empty?\nYes, board shows `.` at (1, 5).\nIs it inside the board? Yes (0-9).\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=5-8).\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nIs there any reason to go LEFT or RIGHT?\nGoing LEFT to (0, 6) leads to (0, 5). No apples there.\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 6) leads to (2, 5). No apples there.\nGoing DOWN leads to (1, 5), then (1, 4) (Apple), then (1, 3) (Apple).\nThis is the optimal path to gain points.\n\nOne check: If I go DOWN to (1, 5), will I be trapped?\nFrom (1, 5), I can go DOWN to (1, 4).\nMy body will be at (1, 6), (1, 7), ...\nAt (1, 5), my tail is moving, so (1, 6) will eventually be empty if I keep moving down. But for the *next* turn, (1, 6) will be occupied by my body (the segment currently at my tail shifts to where my head was).\nSo if I go (1, 6) -> (1, 5), then (1, 6) becomes a body segment.\nNext turn, I can go (1, 5) -> (1, 4).\nThe cell (1, 6) will be safe for my tail.\nThe cell (1, 7) will be safe for my tail.\nThis is a standard snake movement.\n\nDecision: Move DOWN to get closer to the apples.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nMove DOWN to (1, 5). From there, continue DOWN to (1, 4) to eat the apple. Then (1, 3).\n\nDOWN",

I have just moved DOWN from (1, 2).\n*   **Board State**: I am in column 1. There is an apple directly below me at (1, 0).

It is on the bottom row at x=5, while I am at y=1.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 1):**\n*   **UP (1, 2)**: Empty (was just vacated by my head). Safe. Moves me away from the apple at (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT (0, 1)**: Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 1)**: Empty. Safe.\n*   **DOWN (1, 0)**: Contains an **APPLE**.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). Moving DOWN is the optimal move to consume this apple. This grows my body (tail won't move this turn) and increases my score to 8. This also keeps me pinned against the left wall, which is generally safe. The enemy snake is far away on the right side and cannot interfere with this move.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (1, 0). The tail will remain at (2, 7) because I ate. My body will become [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (2, 7)]. At the next turn, I will need to turn around. I will likely need to go RIGHT to (2, 0) or UP to (1, 1). If I go UP, I will be moving back into my own body, so that will be suicide. Therefore, I must go RIGHT to (2, 0) on the following turn. I will plan for that turn when it comes.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

LEFT is a guaranteed safe move.\nTherefore, I will move LEFT to (0, 0). This buys me a turn to plan my escape from the corner. From (0, 0), my only safe move next turn will be UP (since I cannot go DOWN, LEFT, or back to (1, 0) which will be my body). Moving UP to (0, 1) will open up the top half of the board.

Tail at (1, 3).\n*   **Board State**: I am still pinned against the left wall. My body blocks the path to the right at (1, 3) and (1, 2).\n*   **Enemy**: Snake #0 is at (4, 5). The space above me at (0, 5) is currently empty.\n*   **Apples**: (0, 8) is the closest reachable apple. The apples at (2, 2) and (2, 4) are currently blocked by my body.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (0, 4):**\n*   **UP (0, 5)**: On the board. Currently empty (`.`). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (0, 3)**: Occupied by my own body (segment (0, 3)). Death.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 4)**: Off the board. Death.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 4)**: Occupied by my own body (segment (1, 4)? Wait, looking at the body list: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. The cell (1, 4) is actually NOT in the body list. Checking the board map: `(row 4) 1 . A . T . . . . .`. The `T` is at (1, 4)? No, the map shows: `4 1 . A . T . . . . .`. The snake head `1` is at (0, 4). The `T`s are the tail. Let's re-read the map carefully.\n    *   Row 4: `1 . A . T . . . .` -> `1` at (0,4), `T` at (4,4)? No, columns are 0-9.\n    *   Row 4: `1` (col 0), `.` (col 1), `A` (col 2), `.` (col 3), `T` (col 4), `.` (col 5)...\n    *   My body ends at tail (1, 3) according to the text. Let's look at Row 3 on the map: `T T . . T T . . . .`. This row is `y=3`.\n    *   Col 0: `T`, Col 1: `T`, Col 2: `.`, Col 3: `.`, Col 4: `T`, Col 5: `T`...\n    *   My body occupies (0,3) and (1,3). The map shows `T` at (0,3) and (1,3). Perfect match.\n    *   Now back to Row 4 (y=4): `1` at (0,4). The map shows `.` at (1,4). So (1,4) is empty.\n    *   So, moving RIGHT to (1,4) is possible. But does it lead to a trap? I would be at (1,4), surrounded by my body at (0,4) (which becomes body), (0,3), (1,3). The only way out would be UP to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,4).\n    *   Let's look at Row 5: `6 . . . . . . . . . .` -> Empty.\n    *   Let's look at Row 6: `7 . . . . . . . . . .` -> Empty.\n    *   So (1,5) is empty.\n    *   However, looking at the long game, I want to reach (0,8). If I go RIGHT to (1,4), I am moving away from the left wall. To get back to the apple at (0,8), I would have to navigate around my tail, which is a complex maneuver.\n    *   If I go UP to (0,5), I am on the path to (0,8).\n    *   Let's check safety of UP. The tail moves. Current tail is at (1,3). When I move UP, the new tail will be at (1,2) (moving from (1,2) -> (1,3)? No, the tail follows the path).\n    *   Current Body: (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n    *   If I move UP to (0,5): New Head (0,5). New Body starts (0,4), (0,3), ..., (1,3). The tail moves from (1,3) to (1,2).\n    *   This clears (1,3) but fills (0,5).\n    *   Is (0,5) safe? Map shows `.` at (0,5).\n    *   Is there a risk of collision with Snake #0? Snake #0 is at (4,5). That is far away.\n    *   Is there a risk of Snake #0 moving to cut me off? Unlikely.\n    *   Is there a risk of head-on collision? Snake #0 at (4,5) could move UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,5). None of these are (0,5).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI must continue moving UP to reach the apple at (0,8) and eventually clear my body to access the apples at (2,2) and (2,4). Moving RIGHT to (1,4) is a viable survival move but deviates from the most efficient path to the apples.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nFrom (0, 4), I will move UP to (0, 5).\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

I am currently in a safe, open space with my head facing away from my body (downward), giving me multiple potential exits.\n*   **Board State**: I am in Column 0.

It is two steps away. To reach it next turn, I must be at (0, 7) at the end of this turn. Alternatively, there is an apple at (1, 9) which is also reachable if I move right now.\n*   **Enemy**: Snake #0 is at (4, 7). They are far away and not an immediate threat to my position this turn.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (0, 6):**\n*   **UP (0, 7)**: Safe. This places me directly in front of the apple at (0, 8). This is the most direct path to the apple.\n*   **DOWN (0, 5)**: Occupied by my own body. Death.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 6)**: Off the board. Death.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 6)**: Safe. The map shows `.` at (1, 6). Moving here opens up paths to the apple at (1, 9) or (2, 2), and allows me to loop around my body if needed.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to close the gap on Snake #0 (9 apples vs my 8 apples). The apple at (0, 8) is the nearest target. Moving UP secures this apple in the next turn (move to (0, 8) or (1, 8)). Moving RIGHT is also safe but delays grabbing the (0, 8) apple by at least one turn, giving Snake #0 more time to score. Additionally, staying in column 0 reduces the directions I need to watch for threats. I will move UP to secure the apple.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

If they move DOWN, they go back to (4, 7). If they move LEFT, they go to (3, 8). If they move RIGHT, they go to (5, 8).\n    *   Collision Check: Snake #0's head is 4 units away (x-distance).

Restricts movement next turn (only Left or Right will be open, Down will be my body), but getting the point is high priority to catch up.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 7)**: Safe. The cell is empty.

My tail has not moved yet (I grew).\n    *   My available moves from (0, 8):\n        *   **UP**: (0, 9) - Contains apple at (8,9) is far, but (0,9) is currently empty `.` on the board map. It is within bounds.\n        *   **RIGHT**: (1, 8) - Currently empty `.`.\n        *   **LEFT**: (-1, 8) - Off board (Death).\n        *   **DOWN**: (0, 7) - Occupied by my own body (Death).\n*   **Board State**:\n    *   I am at the top edge. My tail is at (1, 0).\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (4, 9). Head at (4, 9). Body extends straight down to (4, 0).\n*   **Enemy #0 Analysis**:\n    *   Head at (4, 9). From there, they can move UP (Off board), DOWN (4, 8), LEFT (3, 9), or RIGHT (5, 9).\n    *   If they move UP, they die.\n    *   If they move DOWN, they return to their previous position.\n    *   If they move LEFT or RIGHT, they move along the top row.\n    *   **Collision Risk**: If I move UP to (0, 9) and Enemy #0 moves LEFT to (3, 9), we do not collide (X distance is 3). If I move RIGHT to (1, 8) and they move LEFT/DOWN, we are separated.\n    *   There are no apples immediately adjacent to my head except the one I just ate. The nearest apples are at (1, 9), (8, 9), and (2, 2).\n*   **Survival Check**:\n    *   **UP (0,9)**: Safe. Empty cell. No walls. No immediate body collision.\n    *   **RIGHT (1,8)**: Safe. Empty cell.\n    *   **DOWN/LEFT**: Death.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (0, 8):**\n*   **UP (0, 9)**:\n    *   **Pros**: Moves towards the top edge, opening up the possibility to traverse rightwards along the top row next turn to target the apples at (1, 9) and (8, 9). It is the most direct path to the cluster of apples in the top right quadrant. Staying in column 0 is limiting; moving up to row 9 allows me to turn East.\n    *   **Cons**: I am at the wall. My only next moves will be DOWN (blocked by body), LEFT (wall), or RIGHT (1,9). This is a \"forced move\" situation, but currently (1,9) appears empty/safe.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 8)**:\n    *   **Pros**: Moves into the interior of the board. Allows for more flexibility.\n    *   **Cons**: Moves away from the closest top-row apples. It forces me to navigate around my own tail later to get to the top.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTo win, I need to close the 1-apple gap against Enemy #0. The top row contains two apples ((1,9) and (8,9)). By moving UP now, I position myself to grab (1,9) next turn if it remains available, and then pursue (8,9). Moving RIGHT delays this significantly. Enemy #0 is likely to chase the (8,9) apple, but they have a long body (9 segments) and are at X=4, so they have a long travel time to the left side. I can likely grab (1,9) safely.\nTherefore, the best move to approach the next objective is UP.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

Their body extends down the column x=4.\n    *   There are no apples on the top row (y=9), except possibly further East which are not currently visible in the raw list but the board shows empty.\n    *   My body blocks the entire left column (x=0) from y=0 to y=9.\n*   **Enemy #0 Analysis**:\n    *   Head at (6, 9).\n    *   They are on the top row.\n    *   Their possible moves: UP (Death), DOWN (6, 8, safe), LEFT (5, 9, safe), RIGHT (7, 9, safe).\n    *   Given their body extends down column 4, they likely want to continue moving East to open up space or find apples.\n    *   **Collision Risk**: I am at (1, 9). Enemy is at (6, 9). We are 5 cells apart on the same row. If both move RIGHT, we will not collide. If I move RIGHT and they move LEFT, the distance closes to 4. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n*   **Survival Check**:\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8)**: Safe. It is empty. It provides access to the board interior.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 9)**: Safe.

Keeps me on the edge where it is generally safer from collisions, provided I don't run out of space.\n    *   **Cons**: Staying on the top row limits my vertical maneuverability (can't go UP). If I keep moving right, eventually I might hit a wall or be forced to turn down blindly.\n*   **DOWN (1, 8)**:\n    *   **Pros**: Moves me into the open interior of the board. From there, I can navigate towards the cluster of apples in the upper-right quadrant ((8,9), (7,2), (6,4)). It keeps my future options open.\n    *   **Cons**: Moving into the center increases the risk of encountering Enemy #0 or getting boxed in by the complex board layout.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to decide between continuing along the top edge or dropping into the main arena. While moving RIGHT towards (8,9) seems intuitive, the top edge is a \"one-way\" street unless I can find a safe way to turn down. My body currently blocks the entire left side. Dropping DOWN now to (1, 8) allows me to navigate around my own body and approach the apples from a safer angle, avoiding potential traps on the top row. The apples at (7,2) and (6,4) are low, so I will likely need to go down eventually. Let's secure the interior space now while I have a clear path.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nDOWN",

Body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)] (Length 11).\n*   **Enemy #0**: Head at (7, 9). Body extends down column 6? No, wait, the board shows '0' at (7,9) and 'T' at (6,9). The body list was [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\n    *   *Correction*: Enemy #0 is at (7,9), but the body list starts at (6,9). This means (6,9) is connected to (7,9). The board shows 'T' at (6,9) which matches. The body continues to (5,9) and (4,9).\n    *   Enemy #0's body blocks column 4 at y=9? No, column 4 is x=4. The list shows (4,9), (4,8), (4,7)... so column 4 is fully blocked from y=3 to y=9.\n    *   Enemy #0's potential moves: UP (Death), DOWN (7,8), LEFT (6,9, occupied by own body), RIGHT (8,9, occupied by an apple but empty space). *Wait, checking the board*: (8,9) is an 'A'. (7,9) is '0'. (6,9) is 'T'. (5,9) is 'T'. (4,9) is 'T'.\n    *   Enemy #0 is trapped on the top row. Their only safe move is RIGHT to (8,9) because (6,9) is their body, and (7,8) is empty but might be risky if they want the apple.\n    *   Actually, (7,9) is at the top row. Enemy #0 cannot go UP. LEFT is (6,9) which is currently listed in their body. If they just ate, the tail might not have moved yet. But standard snake rules usually allow moving into the space the tail *vacates* if the snake doesn't grow. However, the prompt says \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\". Usually, this strictly means the body segments present at the start of the turn.\n    *   Let's assume strict collision: Enemy cannot move LEFT to (6,9) because it is currently occupied by their body.\n    *   Enemy can move DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n    *   (8,9) has an apple. Snakes usually prefer apples. Enemy #0 has 9 apples. I have 10. They are trailing. They likely want to catch up.\n\n*   **My Moves from (1, 8)**:\n    *   **UP**: (1, 9). Occupied by my body (specifically the segment that was my head last turn). **DEATH**.\n    *   **LEFT**: (0, 8). Occupied by my body (column 0 is full). **DEATH**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: (2, 8). Empty on board. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN**: (1, 7). Empty on board. Safe.\n\n*   **Analysis of Safe Moves**:\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 8)**: Moves towards the center-right side of the board.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 7)**: Moves deeper into the left side.\n\n*   **Apple Locations**:\n    *   (8, 9) - Top right corner. Being eyed by Enemy #0.\n    *   (2, 2) - Bottom center.\n    *   (2, 4) - Mid left.\n    *   (7, 2) - Bottom right.\n    *   (6, 4) - Mid right.\n\n*   **Strategy**:\n    *   My body is a wall on the left (x=0).\n    *   I am at (1, 8). To get to apples like (2,4), (6,4), (7,2), I need to navigate the interior.\n    *   Moving DOWN (1, 7) keeps me on the left edge (x=1). This is safer in terms of walls (only 2 directions to check).\n    *   Moving RIGHT (2, 8) moves me into the \"grid\" where snakes can come from more directions.\n    *   However, Enemy #0 is at (7,9). If they go DOWN, they are at (7,8). If I go RIGHT to (2,8), I am on the same row (y=8) but far away (distance 5). Not a collision risk.\n    *   If Enemy goes RIGHT to (8,9), they grab the apple.\n    *   My goal is to survive and find the best path to apples.\n    *   (2,4) and (6,4) are relatively close in the vertical direction. (1,7) is one step closer to y=4 than (1,8).\n    *   Let's look at the board at (1,7): It's a 'T' in the visual? No, row 7 is `T . . . T ...`. Wait, the board is indexed 0-9 bottom to top.\n        Row 9 (top): `9 T T . . T T T 0 A .`\n        Row 8: `8 T 1 . . T . . . . .`\n        Row 7: `7 T . . . T . . . . .`\n        So (1,7) is indeed empty '.'.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (1,7), I am getting closer to the apples at y=4 and y=2.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (2,8), I am moving towards the apples at (8,9) and (6,4), but I am moving into the open grid.\n    *   Let's consider the \"tunnel\" logic. My left side is blocked. The board has obstacles (T) at (4,9) down to (4,3).\n    *   The gap between my left column and the Enemy's body column (x=4) is x=1, 2, 3.\n    *   If I go DOWN now, I can eventually turn right into x=2 or x=3 and sweep across the board.\n    *   If I go RIGHT now, I am at y=8. To get to the apples at y=4, I have to go down eventually. I might run into my own tail if I don't move it down soon.\n    *   My tail is currently at (0,0). The length is 11. The oldest part of my body is at the bottom left. As I move, the tail will follow.\n    *   The board shows a 'T' at (1,9) (my old head). 'T' at (0,9), etc.\n    *   Moving DOWN is a strong move to consolidate the left side and prepare to invade the center.\n\n    *   **Safety Check**:\n        *   Enemy #0: Likely moving RIGHT to (8,9) to eat the apple. If they move DOWN to (7,8), we are separated.\n        *   Me: DOWN to (1,7) is safe.\n\n    *   **Refined Decision**: I want to secure the apples at (2,4) and (2,2) eventually. Moving DOWN is the first step to getting to y=4. I should stick to the left side while I can, creating a \"snake in the grass\" effect where I can strike into the center when safe.\n\n    *   **Long term plan**: Move DOWN to (1,7), then DOWN to (1,6)... continue down until I can turn right at y=4 or y=2 to grab apples. Avoid the top right corner where Enemy #0 is active.\n\n    *   **Wait**: Is (1,7) safe from the Enemy? Yes. Is it safe from myself? Yes.\n    *   Is (2,8) better? Maybe to chase (8,9) if Enemy misses? But Enemy is right next to it. Going there is dangerous. The Enemy is at (7,9). (8,9) is right next to them. I am at (1,8). It's a long run. I should prioritize the closer apples: (2,4) and (2,2).\n\n    *   **Final check**: My head is (1,8).\n        UP: (1,9) -> Body (Death)\n        LEFT: (0,8) -> Body (Death)\n        RIGHT: (2,8) -> Empty\n        DOWN: (1,7) -> Empty\n\n        I choose DOWN to get closer to (2,4) and (2,2) and to avoid the top-right conflict zone.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Their body extends down column 4 and 6. They are trapped in the top-right corner. They are likely to move RIGHT to eat the apple at `(8, 9)` or DOWN to `(7, 8)`. This keeps them contained in the top-right quadrant.\n    *   **Apples**: The closest apples to me are at `(2, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(6, 4)`. To reach these, I need to descend from my current row (`y=8`) to lower rows.\n    *   **Route**: Moving **DOWN** to `(1, 7)` is the correct first step to align myself with the apples at `(2, 4)` and `(2, 2)`. It keeps me pinned to the left wall (which is my own body, creating a safe barrier) until I am ready to sweep right into the center. Moving RIGHT to `(2, 8)` would move me horizontally away from the lower apples without making vertical progress, and would expose me to the open board where Enemy #0 might eventually wander.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Moving DOWN preserves safety, avoids the enemy's territory, and sets up a path to the southern apples.\n\nDOWN",

However, the \"Your last move information\" explicitly states I moved `RIGHT` from `(1,6)`. In simultaneous movement games, my move calculation is based on where I *know* I am going to be after my move, not the potentially stale text representation.\n    - I am at `(2, 6)`.\n    - My tail *was* at `(0, 4)`. I have not eaten an apple, so I will move forward, and my tail will vacate `(0, 4)`.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:**\n    - Current Head: `(7, 8)`.\n    - Current Body: `[(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), ...]`.\n    - Last turn analysis (from their perspective): They likely faced a wall or body at `(8,8)` (since `(9,8)` is a wall). They moved `LEFT` into `(7,8)`.\n    - **Prediction:** They are traversing the top wall. They will likely move `LEFT` to `(6, 8)` this turn.\n\n**Move Evaluation from Head `(2, 6)`:**\n\n1.  **UP:** Target `(2, 7)`.\n    - Board shows `T` at `(2,7)`.\n    - My body fills `(1,6), (1,7)...`. `(1,7)` is occupied.\n    - To survive, `UP` requires `(2,7)` to be empty. It is not.\n    - **INVALID.**\n\n2.  **DOWN:** Target `(2, 5)`.\n    - Board shows `T` at `(2,5)`.\n    - My body: `(1,6), (1,7)...`. `(2,5)` is not in the list (it's the gap created by previous growth/turns).\n    - Actually, looking at the body list: `[(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]`. None of these are `(2,5)`.\n    - The board state `T` might be misleading or referring to the wall/territory, but strictly looking at the body list, `(2,5)` is physically empty.\n    - However, if I go DOWN to `(2,5)`, I am heading towards `(2,4)` which has an apple. `(2,3)` is `.`.\n    - **VALID.**\n\n3.  **LEFT:** Target `(1, 6)`.\n    - Board shows `T`.\n    - My body: `(1, 6)` is the **Head** of my previous position. After I move right, `(1, 6)` becomes part of my body (the neck).\n    - If I turn back into `(1, 6)`, I hit myself.\n    - **INVALID.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target `(3, 6)`.\n    - Board shows `.` (Empty).\n    - Safe from walls and immediate body (Body is at `x=1,0`).\n    - **VALID.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n- **RIGHT to (3,6):**\n    - Opens up access to the center column.\n    - `(4,6)` is `.`.\n    - `(5,6)` is `.`.\n    - This leads to the cluster of apples at `(6,4), (7,2), (7,3)`.\n    - Also keeps a potential path open: `(3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4)` to approach `(2,4)` or `(6,4)` from the east.\n    - **Safety:** High. No body nearby. Enemy is at `(7,8)` (top right), far away.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,5):**\n    - Approaches the apple at `(2,4)`.\n    - **Risk:** If I eat `(2,4)`, I grow. My tail stays at `(0,4)`. I will fill `(2,5)` and `(2,6)`.\n    - Next turn, I would likely try to eat `(2,2)` or `(2,4)` (if already eaten).\n    - This path `(2,6) -> (2,5) -> (2,4)` is a straight line into the left side of the board.\n    - Once I go DOWN, my left side is blocked by `T` (the wall and my body blocking the left wall).\n    - Escaping this left-side column requires going DOWN to `y=3` or `y=2` and turning right. But `x=2` is a narrow column if I am long.\n    - **Comparison:** `RIGHT` to `(3,6)` moves towards the center, offering more freedom of movement (to `x=4,5` or `y=4,3`). `RIGHT` is the more strategic move to avoid getting trapped in the left corner.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI am at `(2, 6)`. I cannot go UP (body), LEFT (backwards/death), or UP (blocked). I must choose between DOWN (towards left-side apple) and RIGHT (towards center/freedom).\nMoving RIGHT to `(3, 6)` is safer in the long run as it opens up the board and approaches the denser apple cluster in the middle/right. Staying on the left side (DOWN) risks trapping myself against the wall if I keep growing.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to `(3, 6)` to enter the central area and approach the apples at `(6,4)` and `(7,3)`. From `(3, 6)`, I will look to move DOWN or RIGHT next turn depending on enemy movement.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Based on the analysis of the current board state and my position:\n\n1.  **Current Position:** I am at `(2, 6)` (Head) with body segments following. I am moving from `(2, 6)`.\n2.  **Eliminating Invalid Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (2, 7):** The board shows `T` (Occupied). My body occupies `(1, 7)`, `(1, 8)`, etc. While `(2, 7)` might not be explicitly in the body list provided, the board state and the \"head back into body\" rule make this risky. More importantly, checking the body list: `[(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)]`. Wait, the provided body list *ends* at `(0, 5)`. This list was missing the head `(2, 6)`? No, the header says \"Head: (3, 6)\" in the last turn's reasoning, but \"Head: (3, 6)\" in the prompt? No, the prompt says \"Head: (3, 6)\" in the summary. The \"Last Move Info\" says I moved RIGHT from `(1, 6)`. So I am now at `(2, 6)`.\n    *   Let's re-read the prompt's body list for My Snake: `[(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)]`.\n    *   **Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (3, 6)\"** in the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section. And then lists the body. There is a discrepancy between the \"Last Move Info\" (which says I moved RIGHT to `(2, 6)`) and the prompt state (which says Head is `(3, 6)`). The \"Last Move Info\" is the log of the action taken. The \"Prompt State\" is the new reality. If the prompt says Head is `(3, 6)`, then my move was executed and I am at `(3, 6)`. If the \"Last Move Info\" is what I did, and the prompt is the result, then I am at `(3, 6)`.\n    *   Let's trust the \"Your snake\" section which explicitly states: **Head: (3, 6)**.\n    *   **Wait, look at the \"Board State\"**: The board shows `1` at `(3, 6)` (Row 6, Column 3). Row 6 is `6 T T T 1 T . . . . .`. So `1` is at `(3, 6)`. Yes, my Head is `(3, 6)`.\n    *   So I am at `(3, 6)`.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluating Moves from Head (3, 6):**\n    *   **UP to (3, 7):** Row 7 is `T T . . T . . 0 . .`. `(3, 7)` is `.`. My body is `[(3, 6), (2, 6), ...]`. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 5):** Row 5 is `T . . . . . . . . .`. `(3, 5)` is `.`. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 6):** Board shows `T` at `(2, 6)` (Row 6 is `T T T ...`). This is occupied by my previous body segment (the neck). If I go LEFT, I hit myself. **INVALID**.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Row 6 shows `.` at `(4, 6)` (Sequence: `T T T 1 T ...` -> `T` at 0, 1, 2; `1` at 3; `T` at 4). Wait. The board row 6 is `T T T 1 T . . . . .`.\n        *   Index 0: T\n        *   Index 1: T\n        *   Index 2: T\n        *   Index 3: 1\n        *   Index 4: T\n        *   Index 5: .\n        *   Index 6: .\n        *   ...\n        So `(4, 6)` is a `T`. This is a Wall or occupied.\n        Let's double check the board map. \"T T T 1 T . . . . .\" at row 6.\n        The coordinates are 0 to 9. 0,1,2 are T. 3 is 1. 4 is T.\n        So `(4, 6)` is a Wall. **INVALID**.\n\n4.  **Valid Moves:** UP or DOWN.\n    *   **UP (3, 7):** Leads to `(3, 8)` which is a Wall (Row 8 starts with `T`). Going UP traps me against the top wall relatively quickly.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 5):** Leads to `(3, 4)` (Row 4: `.`), `(3, 3)` (`.`), `(3, 2)` (`.`). This opens up the central column and allows access to apples at `(2, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(6, 4)`, `(7, 3)`.\n    *   The apple at `(2, 4)` is accessible. `(2, 2)` is accessible.\n    *   Moving DOWN keeps me away from the enemy Snake #0 (at `(7, 7)`) and the occupied top right.\n\n5.  **Strategy:** Moving DOWN is safer and offers more space. Moving UP leads to a wall.\n\n6.  **Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Valid.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** The cell (4, 4) is Empty ('.'). Valid.\n\nComparison of valid moves:\n*   **LEFT** leads to an immediate apple at (2, 4). However, the surrounding area is tight. At (2, 4), looking at next moves: UP (2,5) is Empty, DOWN (2,3) is Empty, LEFT (1,4) is Empty, but RIGHT returns to (3,4) which would be the tail if I move. This is safe in the short term, but restricts movement slightly.\n*   **DOWN** leads to (3, 3), which is Empty. From (3, 3), I can reach the apple at (7, 3) in the East or (2, 2) in the West. This direction opens up the bottom of the board, providing more long-term space to maneuver.\n*   **RIGHT** leads to (4, 4), Empty. From here, I can head towards apples at (6, 4) and (7, 3) very quickly.\n\nAlthough moving **LEFT** gives an immediate point, moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** preserves the option to collect multiple apples later without trapping myself. Given the tight spaces around (2, 4), I will opt for the move that keeps the most space open. Down is a strong candidate to reach (2, 2) and (7, 3). Right is also strong for (6, 4) and (7, 3).\n\nTo maximize my survival and future options, I will move **RIGHT** to head towards the cluster of apples in the center/right of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

According to the board state (row 5: `. . . T . . . 0 . . .`), (5, 5) is empty ('.'). This is a safe move.\n    *   **DOWN:** (5, 3). My body is at (4, 4) and (3, 4). (5, 3) is empty ('.'), but I must check if it leads to a trap or immediate death. It is not immediate death.\n    *   **LEFT:** (4, 4). This is my own body segment (represented by '1' in the visual board, though coordinates confirm). **IMMEDIATE DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (6, 4). The board shows this is an Apple ('A'). Moving here eats the apple.\n\n2.  **Immediate Threat Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy Snake #0 is at Head (7, 5). It has a body to its immediate left (7, 6) and potentially other occupied cells. It can likely move to adjacent empty cells or apples.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n        *   If I move **UP** to (5, 5), the Enemy at (7, 5) cannot reach me in one move (too far).\n        *   If I move **DOWN** to (5, 3), the Enemy at (7, 5) cannot reach me in one move.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 4), the Enemy at (7, 5) is 2 units away (Manhattan distance). It cannot reach (6, 4) in one turn.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Move RIGHT:** This moves me to (6, 4), which is an apple. I gain +1 apple, growing immediately. My new length is 11. This increases my score to 11. The cell (6, 4) is adjacent to the Enemy's body at (6, 6) and (7, 6), but since the Enemy moves simultaneously, and (6, 4) is not a valid move for the Enemy from its current position (Manhattan distance >= 1 for all its possible valid moves), I will not be crashed into. This is the best scoring move.\n    *   **Move UP:** Moves to (5, 5), which is empty. This keeps me safe but scores no points immediately.\n    *   **Move DOWN:** Moves to (5, 3), which is empty. This scores no points immediately.\n\n    Since moving **RIGHT** is safe (no immediate death, no head-on collision with the enemy this turn) and guarantees an apple, it is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6, 4) to reach 11 points. From (6, 4), navigate toward the apples at (7, 3) and (2, 4). Maintain distance from Enemy #0 and avoid being trapped against the right wall.\n\nRIGHT",

Checking the board state (row 5: `. . . T . . . 0 . . .`), (6, 5) is empty ('.'). This is a safe move.\n    *   **DOWN:** (6, 3). The board state for row 3 (`. . . . . . . A . .`) shows (6, 3) is empty. My tail is currently at (0, 9). Since I am moving, the tail cell (0, 9) will vacate. The cell immediately behind my head is (5, 4). (6, 3) is not (5, 4), so moving down is not immediately lethal into myself.\n    *   **LEFT:** (5, 4). This is the neck of my snake. **IMMEDIATE DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (7, 4). The board state for row 4 (`. . . A T T T 1 0 . .`) shows (7, 4) is occupied by Snake #0 ('0'). **IMMEDIATE DEATH.**\n\n2.  **Threat Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy Snake #0 is at Head (7, 4). It is currently right next to me. It will move in one of the valid directions (Up, Down, Left, Right). Since I cannot move Right (collision with Enemy), I must ensure I don't move into a cell the Enemy is targeting if we collide.\n    *   However, simply surviving the immediate collision is the priority. Both UP and DOWN are safe from immediate collision with the Enemy's current position.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Move UP to (6, 5):** This places me in an open space. The Enemy at (7, 4) could move Up to (7, 5), which is adjacent to my new position, but that is a safe outcome (no head-on collision). This move keeps me central.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (6, 3):** This places me in an open space. The Enemy at (7, 4) could move Down to (7, 3), which is an apple ('A'). If the Enemy eats the apple at (7, 3), it grows, but it doesn't kill me. Moving Down also opens up a potential path to the apples at (7, 2) and (2, 2).\n    *   **Comparison:** Both UP and DOWN are valid survival moves. Moving DOWN to (6, 3) puts me closer to the apple at (7, 2) and the cluster of apples at (2, 2) and (2, 4). It also moves me away from the Enemy at (7, 4), creating space. Moving UP to (6, 5) moves me near the Enemy's body at (6, 6) and (7, 6). Generally, moving DOWN seems slightly more advantageous for pathing towards the lower apples.\n\n4.  **Decision:** Move DOWN to (6, 3). It is a safe immediate move that preserves life and sets up potential routes to future apples.\n\nLong-term Plan:\nSurvive the immediate proximity of Enemy #0. Move Down to (6, 3) to access the lower board apples ((7, 2), (2, 2)) and maintain distance from the enemy.\n\nDOWN\nEND RATIONALE",

This is occupied by the enemy. **Collision.** (Note: Even if the board text shows 'A' at (7,3) in the static view, the explicit snake data confirms (7,3) is occupied by the enemy head).\n\n2.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Safe Moves:** DOWN and LEFT.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 3):** Moves me further left into the open area. This is a safe, passive move.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 2):** Moves me towards the apples at (2, 2) and (7, 2). This is an active, scoring-oriented move.\n\n3.  **Comparison:**\n    *   Moving **DOWN** positions me to collect apples in the next few turns. I am currently at (6, 3). If I go DOWN to (6, 2), I am on a path to reach the apples. I need to be careful about the enemy snake #0 at (7, 3), but moving DOWN creates space.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** is safe but moves away from the apples at (7, 2) and (2, 2).\n\n    Given that DOWN is safe and moves me toward scoring opportunities (apples at y=2), it is the superior move.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

However, the enemy snake (ID 0) is currently at (8, 1). If I move Right to (7, 0) and the enemy moves Left or Down, I risk a head-on collision or being blocked next turn. The enemy is closer to (9, 0) than I am (distance 2 for them vs 2 for me, but they have a direct line).\n*   **Left (5, 0)** leads towards the open space in the bottom-left quadrant and the apple at (2, 2). This direction is away from the enemy's current position, giving me more breathing room to maneuver without immediate collision risk.\n*   Looking at the board, the area at x < 5, y < 5 is mostly empty, while the right side is becoming crowded with the enemy. Moving Left maximizes my available space and keeps the option to go for (2, 2) or (2, 4) later. It also avoids a potential trap at the right edge where the enemy is.\n\nI will choose **LEFT** to secure space and navigate towards the apples in the lower-left quadrant, avoiding the immediate conflict over the apple at (9, 0).\n\nLong-term plan: Move Left to (5,0), then continue Left to (4,0), (3,0) to clear the tail. Target the apple at (2,2) or (2,4) once the tail is shortened. Monitor enemy movement to ensure they don't cut off the path to the bottom-left.\n\nLEFT",

(empty).\n    *   Analysis: This moves up into open space. It does not immediately hit a wall or body. However, the board shows the enemy snake's body extends to (5, 5) and likely (5, 6) based on the chain. Moving UP brings me closer to the central area where the enemy is active. It is a safe move for now.\n\n2.  **DOWN (4, -1):**\n    *   Coordinates: (4, -1).\n    *   Board state: Off board.\n    *   Result: **DEATH**.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (5, 0):**\n    *   Coordinates: (5, 0).\n    *   Board state: Occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following the head).\n    *   Result: **DEATH**.\n\n4.  **LEFT (3, 0):**\n    *   Coordinates: (3, 0).\n    *   Board state: '.'

It keeps me low on the board, away from the enemy snake which is currently at (9, 0) (same row, far right) and whose body is mostly in the upper right quadrant (x=6 to 9, y=1 to 9). Moving LEFT avoids potential confrontation in the center and positions me to eventually go for the apple at (2, 2).\n\n**Strategy:**\nComparing UP (4,1) and LEFT (3,0): Both are safe. However, the enemy snake is at (9,0) and is likely moving towards the center or up (since moving right is off-board). By moving LEFT, I am moving away from the enemy. By moving UP, I am moving towards the general area where the enemy might be heading. Staying low and left maximizes distance from the enemy. The path to the apple at (2,2) also requires moving left eventually. Therefore, LEFT is the safest option that also aligns with collecting the closest apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving Left to (3,0), (2,0) to position for the apple at (2,2). Avoid the right side of the board where the enemy is active.\n\nLEFT",

A 1 . . T T T . ` (x=0 to 9). This implies (4, 2) is empty ('.').\n    *   However, my body list shows `(3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)`.\n    *   (4, 2) is not in the body list.

(2, 2) is in the apple list.\n    *   This is the best move. It guarantees growth and points. It moves me towards the cluster of apples at (2, 2) and (2, 4).\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince **LEFT** provides an immediate point and is safe, it is the optimal move. I will eat the apple at (2, 2), gaining a segment. My tail will remain at (4, 4) this turn, effectively extending my body. This move also positions me to go for (2, 4) next or maneuver around the left side.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat the apple at (2, 2). Next turn, I will likely target the apple at (2, 4). I must be careful of the wall at x=0, but for now, I have plenty of space. I need to close the gap with Snake #0 (14 apples vs 11 apples).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\nBoard state:\n- Your snake (ID 0): Head at (7,1), Body: [(7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)]\n- Enemy snake (ID 1): Head at (3,2), Body: [(3,1), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n- Apples at: (2,2), (2,4), (9,8), (9,4), (9,9)\n\nPossible moves for your snake (head at (7,1)):\n1. UP: (7,2) - invalid (would hit own body)\n2. DOWN: (7,0) - invalid (would hit own body)\n3. LEFT: (6,1) - invalid (would hit enemy snake's body)\n4. RIGHT: (8,1) - invalid (would hit own body)\n\nWait a minute, this seems problematic. According to the board state, all four directions appear to be blocked. But this can't be right since the game would have ended if there were no valid moves. Let me re-examine the board state more carefully.\n\nLooking at the board representation:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . . . . A\n 7 . . . . . . T T . .\n 6 . . . . . . T T . .\n 5 . . . . . . . T . .\n 4 . . A . T T T T . A\n 3 . . . . . . T T . .\n 2 . . A 1 . . T T T .\n 1 . . . T . . T 0 T T\n 0 . . . T T T T T T T\n```\n\nYour head is at (7,1) which is marked as \"0\" on the board. Let me check the adjacent cells:\n- (7,2): This is marked as \"T\" (your body)\n- (7,0): This is marked as \"T\" (your body)\n- (6,1): This is marked as \"T\" (enemy body)\n- (8,1): This is marked as \"T\" (your body)\n\nThis indeed shows all four directions are blocked. However, this contradicts the game rules where you should have at least one valid move. Let me check the body coordinates again:\n\nYour body: [(7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)]\n\nSo (7,1) is your head, and (7,0) is the first body segment. This means moving DOWN to (7,0) would be moving into your own body, which is invalid.\n\nBut wait - the rules state: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So moving DOWN to (7,0) is indeed invalid.\n\nThis seems to be a dead-end situation. However, since the game hasn't ended, I must have made an error in interpreting the board. Let me look at the board representation again more carefully.\n\nLooking at row 1 (y=1):\n```\n 1 . . . T . . T 0 T T\n```\nPositions:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: T\n4: .\n5: .\n6: T\n7: 0 (your head)\n8: T\n9: T\n\nSo at (7,1) is your head (0), and (8,1) is T (your body), (6,1) is T (enemy body), (7,0) would be below, and (7,2) would be above.\n\nLooking at row 0 (y=0):\n```\n 0 . . . T T T T T T T\n```\nSo (7,0) is T (your body).\n\nLooking at row 2 (y=2):\n```\n 2 . . A 1 . . T T T .\n```\nSo (7,2) is T (your body).\n\nThis confirms all four directions are indeed blocked. This is a critical situation where no valid moves are available, which should result in your snake dying. However, since the game is still ongoing, I must have misunderstood something.\n\nWait - perhaps the board representation is showing the state AFTER the last move, not the current state. The last move was UP to (7,1), and now we're at turn 59, so this is the state after that move. But if all directions are blocked, the game should have ended.\n\nThis suggests there might be an error in my interpretation. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the board is showing the state BEFORE the move, and I need to consider that the enemy snake will also move.\n\nBut even so, in the current state as shown, all four directions from (7,1) are blocked. This is a paradox.\n\nGiven that this is turn 59 and the game is still ongoing, I must conclude that there's at least one valid move available. Let me re-examine the possibility of moving UP to (7,2).\n\nLooking at your body coordinates: (7,2) is indeed in your body list. So moving UP would hit your own body.\n\nSimilarly, DOWN to (7,0) is in your body, LEFT to (6,1) is enemy body, and RIGHT to (8,1) is your body.\n\nThis seems to be a genuine dead-end. However, since the game hasn't ended, perhaps the board representation is slightly different from what I'm interpreting.\n\nGiven that I must make a move, and all directions appear blocked, I'll have to choose the least bad option. But according to the rules, any of these moves would kill me.\n\nThis is a critical error in my analysis. Let me try one more time to find a valid move.\n\nWait! Looking at the board again:\n```\n 1 . . . T . . T 0 T T\n```\nAt (7,1) is 0 (your head). The cell to the right is (8,1) which is T (your body). But what about (8,1) in your body list? Yes, it's there: (8,1) is in your body.\n\nBut what about (6,1)? It's marked as T on the board, and it's in the enemy snake's body: [(3,1), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), ...]\n\nSo all four directions are indeed blocked. This must be an error in the game state or my understanding.\n\nGiven that I must provide a move, and all directions seem invalid, I'll have to make a choice. Perhaps the board representation is slightly off, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding about the coordinates.\n\nLooking at the board one more time, I notice that at (7,1) is your head (0), and the cell above it at (7,2) is T (your body). But wait - in your body list, (7,2) is indeed present.\n\nThis is truly a dead-end. However, since the game is still ongoing, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the board is showing the state after the enemy has moved but before you move? That doesn't make sense with the turn order.\n\nGiven that I have to choose something, and all moves seem invalid, I'll go with UP, as it's the direction that was safe last turn, even though it appears blocked now. This might be a misinterpretation on my part.\n\nUP",
