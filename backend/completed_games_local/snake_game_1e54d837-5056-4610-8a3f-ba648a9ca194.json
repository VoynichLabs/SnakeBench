All likely safe unless enemy moves into one of them simultaneously next turn.  \n- **LEFT to (3,8):** Next turn moves: UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7), LEFT (2,8), RIGHT (4,8).  \n- **RIGHT to (5,8):** Next turn moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8).  \n\nAll give 3 or 4 safe next moves (depending on enemy).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (5,4) is 4 steps away from (4,8) (Manhattan distance).  \n- (8,6) is 6 steps away.  \n- (0,6) is 6 steps away.  \n- (3,0) is 8 steps away.  \n- (9,9) is 6 steps away.  \n\nFrom (4,8):  \nDOWN gets me closer to (5,4) (now 5 steps away?

(5,4) is central and safer to approach than edge apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nCurrently moving towards (5,4). Avoid top edge since my tail is at (4,9). Keep distance from enemy head at (2,7). Prefer moves that keep 3+ safe options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN keeps me safe, moves toward central apple (5,4), and doesn\u2019t box me in.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s bad.  \nIf I move LEFT to (3,7) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,7), I land where enemy was, no collision.  \nIf I move LEFT to (3,7) and enemy moves UP/DOWN, also no collision.  \n\nSo LEFT is risky only if enemy stays still. But enemy has no reason to stay still since they have apples to chase. Still, it\u2019s a risk.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,7) or DOWN to (4,6), enemy can\u2019t collide with me unless they move into my new cell simultaneously \u2014 but from (3,7) to (5,7) isn\u2019t possible in one move, so no direct head-on risk.  \n\nSo safest: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (4,7):  \n- To (5,4): distance = |1|+|3| = 4  \n- To (8,6): distance = |4|+|1| = 5  \n- To (0,6): distance = |4|+|1| = 5  \n- To (3,0): distance = |1|+|7| = 8  \n- To (9,9): distance = |5|+|2| = 7  \n\nClosest apple is (5,4).  \n\nDOWN to (4,6): distance to (5,4) = |1|+|2| = 3 (closer).  \nRIGHT to (5,7): distance to (5,4) = |0|+|3| = 3 (also closer).  \n\nBoth equally closer to (5,4) in Manhattan distance.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options:**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,6):  \nNext turn possible moves: UP (back to (4,7)), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,7):  \nNext turn possible moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Also fine.  \n\nBoth keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible threat:**  \n\nEnemy at (3,7) might move DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 if I go DOWN to (4,6), we\u2019d be adjacent horizontally next turn, which could set up future collision risk. If I go RIGHT to (5,7), I\u2019m farther from enemy.  \n\nGiven my tail is at (4,8), going RIGHT might be slightly better for avoiding being near enemy next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nMoving toward (5,4) is good. Keep distance from enemy head at (3,7). Avoid boxing myself near edges. Prefer central area for more options.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe and move toward closest apple. RIGHT gives slightly more distance from enemy head now and avoids being adjacent next turn if enemy moves DOWN.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP will be blocked. But apples at (8,6) and (0,6) are far. Closest apple might be (3,0) or (8,6). I can move LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT next turn to start heading toward another apple while keeping safe distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gets apple, is safe, gives point lead, and future mobility is okay (3 options next turn). LEFT and RIGHT delay eating.  \n\nBest move: **DOWN**  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Apple at (8, 6) is safe unless enemy head moves there simultaneously this turn \u2192 but enemy at (3, 6) cannot reach (8, 6) in 1 move. So RIGHT to apple is safe this turn. Wait, I\u2019m checking mobility *next* turn, but apple could be eaten this turn if I go RIGHT now, not relevant for future mobility from UP. Anyway, from (7, 6): 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 5):**  \nBody becomes [(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)], tail (6, 4).  \nFrom (8, 5): UP (8, 6) apple (free), DOWN (8, 4) free, LEFT (7, 5) body \u2192 blocked, RIGHT (9, 5) free. Also 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 5):**  \nBody becomes [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)], tail (6, 4).  \nFrom (6, 5): UP (6, 6) free, DOWN (6, 4) body \u2192 blocked, LEFT (5, 5) free, RIGHT (7, 5) body \u2192 blocked. Only 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Worse.  \n\nSo LEFT reduces future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nLEFT yields fewer safe moves next turn, so discard it unless necessary.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP (7, 6) \u2192 more central, away from right edge (x=9).  \nRIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 closer to right edge but still fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Apple eating potential:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), next turn I can go UP to (8, 6) to eat apple.  \nIf I go UP to (7, 6), next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 6) to eat apple.  \nBoth get me to apple in 2 moves.  \n\nBut if enemy moves toward (8, 6) in the meantime? Enemy at (3, 6) is far (distance 5). It would take at least 5 moves to reach (8, 6), so no risk of apple being taken before I can get there if I go directly.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible moves:**  \nEnemy at (3, 6) could move toward apple (0, 6) or (3, 0) etc., not immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 10 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT are equally good for reaching closest apple and have equal immediate safety and future mobility. I\u2019ll pick **UP** because it keeps me slightly more centered and avoids moving toward right edge prematurely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 6), likely move RIGHT to (8, 6) to eat apple, unless enemy somehow threatens that cell (unlikely). Check safety then.  \n\nUP",

Enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, or UP from (4, 9). Only UP would move it to (4, 10) (invalid), DOWN to (4, 8), LEFT to (3, 9), RIGHT to (5, 9). So enemy cannot reach (8, 9) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on collision.  \n\n2. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 8)  \n   - In bounds: yes  \n   - Occupied by my body: no  \n   - Occupied by enemy body: no  \n   - Enemy cannot reach (9, 8) from (4, 9) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on collision.  \n\n3. **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 7)  \n   - Occupied by my own body (tail segment) \u2192 illegal (death).  \n\n4. **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 8)  \n   - In bounds: yes  \n   - Occupied by my body: no  \n   - Occupied by enemy body: no  \n   - Enemy cannot reach (7, 8) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on collision.  \n\nSo **DOWN** is eliminated immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility consideration:**  \n\nFrom (8, 9):  \n- Possible moves next turn: UP (8, 10) out of bounds \u2192 invalid, DOWN (8, 8) currently empty but will be tail after move? Let\u2019s check: moving UP now means body becomes [(8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)] \u2014 tail at (8, 6), so (8, 8) will be occupied by my body next turn. So from (8, 9) next turn, DOWN would be into my own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (7, 9) empty, RIGHT (9, 9) apple (good). So from (8, 9) next turn, valid moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 safe moves unless apple eaten changes length).  \n\nFrom (9, 8):  \n- Next turn moves: UP (9, 9) apple, DOWN (9, 7) empty, LEFT (8, 8) occupied by my body next turn (since I\u2019d move right now, body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)]), so LEFT invalid. So from (9, 8) next turn: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).  \n\nFrom (7, 8):  \n- Next turn moves: UP (7, 9) empty, DOWN (7, 7) empty, LEFT (6, 8) empty, RIGHT (8, 8) occupied by my body next turn. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- Closest apple: (9, 9) distance from (8, 8): |9-8|+|9-8| = 2  \n   - UP \u2192 (8, 9): distance to (9, 9) = 1  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8): distance to (9, 9) = 1  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (7, 8): distance to (9, 9) = 3  \nSo UP and RIGHT both move closer to nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy considerations:**  \nEnemy at (4, 9) \u2014 far away, no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nAll three (UP, RIGHT, LEFT) are safe this turn.  \n- UP: gets to apple in 2 moves, future safe moves = 2 next turn.  \n- RIGHT: gets to apple in 2 moves, future safe moves = 2 next turn.  \n- LEFT: moves away from nearest apple, but better future mobility (3 safe moves next turn).  \n\nGiven my last move was UP toward apple (9, 9) and my rationale last turn was to go UP for mobility and apple proximity, continuing UP now still makes sense: I\u2019ll be at (8, 9), apple at (9, 9) next to me next turn, I can go RIGHT to eat it. That\u2019s safe unless enemy does something unexpected, but enemy is far.  \n\nLEFT gives more options but delays apple eating. Since I want to maximize score, going toward apple now is reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I move UP now to (8, 9), next turn I can go RIGHT to (9, 9) to eat apple, then grow. After eating, I\u2019ll have more length, so future mobility might reduce, but will be fine. Keep enemy at a distance; it has no body so it\u2019s short and can turn quickly.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

That\u2019s my tail, but moving into your own body kills you regardless \u2014 yes, even if it\u2019s the tail cell, because all body counts except if tail moves away first? Wait, rules: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d That includes your own tail unless tail moves away at same time. But tail moves only when head moves onto apple; otherwise, tail follows. Currently, I did not eat an apple last turn, so tail will stay at (8, 8) or move? Let's trace: My body: head (7, 8), then (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8). If I move RIGHT to (8, 8), my head goes into (8, 8), which is currently occupied by my tail. Simultaneously, my tail will move because I didn't eat apple: tail segment (8, 8) will vacate as body shifts. But do we check occupancy before or after movement? In Snake, you die if your head moves into a cell occupied by your body *before* movement (excluding the tail cell if it will move). But here the rules say \u201cincluding your own\u201d and \u201cMoving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\u201d That\u2019s a specific warning about backwards, but general rule says any part of body. So safest to assume tail cell counts unless it\u2019s moving away because head grew. Since no apple eaten last turn, tail will move away from (8, 8) to (8, 9)? Wait: Let\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent: head (7,8), body[1]=(7,9), body[2]=(8,9), body[3]=(8,8)=tail.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (8,8):  \nNew head = (8,8).  \nBody shifts: old head (7,8) becomes new body[1], old body[1] (7,9) becomes new body[2], old body[2] (8,9) becomes new body[3], old tail (8,8) is gone (since length stays same). So tail cell (8,8) is vacated because tail moved to (8,9). So at the moment head moves to (8,8), that cell is currently occupied by old tail, but old tail is leaving it. In standard Snake rules, that is allowed (you can move into your tail\u2019s old position safely). The rules here didn\u2019t explicitly state exception for tail, but it\u2019s implied by \u201cbody\u201d meaning segments that remain after movement. Since tail leaves, it\u2019s not occupied after movement, so head can occupy it. But they said \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d That suggests checking pre-move occupancy. If so, then moving into tail cell is fatal. Given they explicitly warned about backwards into body, maybe they count tail as body. Safer to assume it\u2019s illegal unless they clarify. Let\u2019s check enemy snake: no body at all, so can\u2019t test. I\u2019ll assume strict reading: tail cell counts as body \u2192 RIGHT is illegal.  \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with that assumption:  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,8) occupied by my tail \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8). UP unsafe (body), RIGHT unsafe (tail).  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake possible moves from (5, 9):**  \nEnemy head at (5, 9), body: none.  \nPossible moves: UP off board (y=10) \u2192 illegal. DOWN to (5,8), LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9). All except UP are safe for them.  \n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision check:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), enemy could move DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 no collision. Enemy could move RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 no collision. Enemy could move LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 no collision. So no head-on risk with LEFT.  \nIf I move DOWN to (7,7), enemy nowhere near.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (9,9) far, (0,6) far, (3,0) far, (9,2) far, (0,2) far. Closest is (0,6) but still far. My current position (7,8), moving DOWN to (7,7) not closer to any apple really. Moving LEFT to (6,8) slightly closer to (0,6) but marginally.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (7,7): possible moves next turn: UP back to (7,8) (occupied by my neck then?), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7), DOWN to (7,6). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \nFrom (6,8): possible moves next turn: UP (6,9) currently empty, DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) (occupied by my old head position which will be body next turn). So RIGHT next turn from (6,8) might be blocked.  \n\nBoth seem okay.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nNeed to start collecting apples to increase score lead (currently 3 vs 0). Enemy is small, might be easy to trap later. Move towards nearest apple (0,6) or (0,2) by going leftwards.  \n\nLEFT move gets me closer to left side apples and keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 off board (y=10) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8) currently my head, but if I move away, it\u2019s empty; if I stay, they collide into me and die.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9) occupied by my body (third segment) \u2192 they die if they go there.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (if I move away), LEFT.  \nIf enemy chooses DOWN and I\u2019m still at (6, 8), they die.  \nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (5, 9), safe.  \n\nThey might choose DOWN hoping I leave (6, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple considerations:**  \nClosest apple to me (6, 8) is (0, 6) distance |6-0|+|8-6|=6+2=8, (0, 2) distance 6+6=12, (3, 0) distance 3+8=11, (9, 2) distance 3+6=9, (9, 9) distance 3+1=4.  \nActually (9, 9) is closest (Manhattan distance 4):  \nFrom (6, 8) to (9, 9): need RIGHT 3, UP 1.  \n\nBut (9, 9) is near my tail (8, 9) and enemy is at (6, 9).  \n\nIf I go DOWN or LEFT, I move away from (9, 9).  \nIf I go UP to (6, 9) and enemy leaves, I could then go RIGHT towards (9, 9) next turns. But UP is risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (6, 7) DOWN: moves next turn: UP back to (6, 8) (occupied by my old neck? Not if body shifts), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7), DOWN (6, 6). Likely safe.  \n\nFrom (5, 8) LEFT: moves next turn: UP (5, 9) possibly enemy location now, DOWN (5, 7), LEFT (4, 8), RIGHT back to (6, 8) (occupied by my old neck).  \n\nBoth okay, but (5, 8) is closer to left-side apples (0, 6) and (0, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nUP could kill me if enemy stays. Enemy might stay if they think I\u2019ll move away from (6, 8) and they want to eat apple (9, 9) by going RIGHT next turn? But they can\u2019t go RIGHT from (6, 9) because (7, 9) is my body \u2014 they\u2019d die. So they won\u2019t stay in (6, 9) to go RIGHT next turn. They might stay to go DOWN into my old head if I leave? But if I go UP, they\u2019d die if they go DOWN (head-on in different cells? No, they\u2019d go to (6, 8) and I\u2019d go to (6, 9), no collision). Actually, if I go UP and they go DOWN, no collision. If I go UP and they stay, collision. Would they stay? Possibly if they think I won\u2019t go UP. But they have no info. Safer for me to avoid UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nI have a lead (3 apples vs 0). Avoid unnecessary risk. Move towards left-side apples gradually while keeping space.  \n\nLEFT to (5, 8) seems safe and progresses toward (0, 6).  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake is at (5, 8), with its body at (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9).\n\nLet's consider the possible moves:\n\n*   **UP:** (5, 10). Invalid - off the board.\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 8). This puts me directly next to the enemy snake's head. Risky, but potentially okay if the enemy moves.\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 9). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 9). This puts me directly into the enemy snake's body at (6,8). Invalid - would kill me.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5, 8). If it goes UP, it will be at (5, 9). If it goes DOWN, it will be at (5, 7). If it goes LEFT, it will be at (4, 8). If it goes RIGHT, it will be at (6, 8).\n\nMoving DOWN is risky. Moving RIGHT is fatal. Moving LEFT to (4,9) is safe, but doesn't get me closer to any apples.\n\nI think the best move is to go DOWN to (5,8). It's risky, but it puts me in a position to potentially grab the apple at (9,9) next turn. If the enemy snake moves UP, we'll collide. But if it moves in any other direction, I'll be safe. I'm willing to take that risk.\n\nLong-term plan: I will try to move towards the apple at (9,9), while being mindful of the enemy snake's movements. I will prioritize avoiding collisions and keeping my options open. I will attempt to circle around the enemy snake to get to the apple at (9,9).\n\nDOWN",
