A head-on collision would require both snakes to move to the same cell in this turn.

After eating (2,3), assess adjacent apples (1,3) and (2,2) for safe picks (avoid trapping myself in the lower Y cluster).\n3.

Evaluate safe moves:\n1. **UP (new head (0,7))**:\n   - Aligns with short-term apple targeting (next nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 1)\n   - Preliminary follow-up safe options (post-move): 2 (UP to (0,8), RIGHT to (1,7)) \u2192 avoids trapping\n   - Maintains position along the x=0 edge, far from Enemy Snake 1\u2019s upper-right quadrant\n2. **RIGHT (new head (1,6))**:\n   - No immediate apple gain (nearest apple (0,8) is 3 Manhattan distance away)\n   - Preliminary follow-up safe options: 2 (UP to (1,7), RIGHT to (2,6)) \u2192 equal mobility but lower priority than apple proximity\n   - Risks drifting toward our own body\u2019s y=5 segment, reducing future navigation flexibility\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 2-3 Turns)\n1. After moving to (0,7) this turn, prioritize moving UP to (0,8) next turn to eat that apple (immediate gain, low collision risk).\n2. Post-(0,8) apple collection, evaluate if moving UP to (0,9) (on-board) is safe; if so, use it to maintain edge positioning before considering RIGHT moves.\n3. Continue monitoring Enemy Snake 1\u2019s movement\u2014if it targets (7,9) or (8,4), maintain a \u22653 Manhattan distance from its head to avoid accidental collision.\n4. After upper-left apples are collected, assess the (0,0) apple\u2019s accessibility along the x=0 edge; avoid moving down past (0,5) until Enemy Snake 1 is confirmed to be in a distant quadrant.\n\nUP",

High risk of collision\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7):** Need to check this position\n\nLooking at the board, I need to verify what's at (5, 7). The board shows positions 0-9 horizontally at each row. Looking at row 7: \"T . T 0 1 . . . . .\" - position 5 has my head (1), position 6 and 7 are empty (.).\n\nSo (5, 7) is empty and safe.\n\n**Between DOWN (4, 6) and RIGHT (5, 7):**\n\nDOWN to (4, 6): After moving, I'd have limited options and could be at risk if Snake #0 moves toward me.\n\nRIGHT to (5, 7): This moves me toward the apples at (5, 5) and (5, 3). From there I could go DOWN to (5, 6) or continue toward the apple cluster.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- Snake #0 has 10 apples, I have 4 - I'm behind and need to catch up\n- The apples at (5, 5) and (5, 3) are most accessible to me\n- RIGHT moves me toward those apples while keeping me safe\n- After moving RIGHT to (5, 7), I can move DOWN to (5, 6) next turn, getting closer to (5, 5)\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7), then work toward the (5, 5) apple cluster while avoiding conflict with Snake #0.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Snake #1 full head-to-tail: [(4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9)]. Evaluate all four directions:\n- **UP (y+1)**: New head (3,8) \u2192 On-board, not own body, not enemy body, not backwards (backwards = (2,7)) \u2192 Safe\n- **DOWN (y-1)**: New head (3,6) \u2192 On-board, not own body, not enemy body, not backwards \u2192 Safe\n- **LEFT (x-1)**: New head (2,7) \u2192 Matches own body segment \u2192 Immediate death \u2192 Eliminated\n- **RIGHT (x+1)**: New head (4,7) \u2192 On-board, not own body (enemy head is not their body), not backwards \u2192 Safe\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves\nThree safe moves remain (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Key metrics: closest reachable apple = (5,5) (Manhattan distance 4 from current head (3,7)); Enemy Snake #1\u2019s possible moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7).\n1. **UP (3,8)**:\n   - Proximity to (5,5): Distance increases to 5 \u2192 poor apple progress.\n   - Follow-up safe moves: Only 1 (UP) \u2192 severe mobility restriction.\n   - Collision risk: Low, but strategic value is minimal.\n2. **DOWN (3,6)**:\n   - Proximity to (5,5): Distance decreases to 3 \u2192 good apple progress.\n   - Follow-up safe moves: 2 (LEFT, RIGHT) \u2192 moderate mobility.\n3. **RIGHT (4,7)**:\n   - Proximity to (5,5): Distance decreases to 3 \u2192 equal apple progress to DOWN.\n   - Follow-up safe moves: 2 (DOWN, RIGHT) \u2192 moderate mobility.\n   - Collision risk: Zero (enemy can\u2019t reach (4,7) in one turn, no head-on collision possible).\n   - Strategic edge: Aligns with the (5,5) apple\u2019s x-coordinate for a more direct path.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 2-3 Turns)\n1. After moving RIGHT to (4,7) this turn, prioritize moving RIGHT to (5,7) next turn (if safe) to get closer to the (5,5) apple.\n2. Monitor Enemy Snake #1's movement: if it moves DOWN to (4,6) this turn, avoid (4,6) next turn and pivot to moving RIGHT to (5,7) instead.\n3. After reaching (5,7), plan to move DOWN twice to (5,5) to eat that apple (verify own body growth and enemy positions before each move).\n4. Once (5,5) is eaten, next target the (5,3) apple while maintaining at least 2 safe follow-up moves to avoid trapping your growing body (current length 11, will be 12 after next apple).\n\nRIGHT",
