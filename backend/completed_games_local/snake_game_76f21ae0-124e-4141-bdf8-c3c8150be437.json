The enemy was at (8,2) - let me check if it could have moved into my position.\n\nIf the enemy moved UP twice from (8,2), it would be at (8,4).

Moving DOWN to (1,3) would result in both snakes dying since Snake #1 would likely move UP to (1,3) as well (avoiding their body at (5,1) and moving toward me).\n\nLooking at the remaining safe moves:\n- UP to (1,5) brings me closer to (1,6) - 1 move away\n- LEFT to (0,4) brings me closer to (0,6) - 2 moves away, and (0,2) - 2 moves away\n\nSnake #1 is ahead with 6 apples and is now very close to the apple at (0,2), which they can reach in just 1 move if they go LEFT. I need to focus on the apple at (1,6) which is closer to me.\n\nMoving UP to (1,5) is the best choice because:\n1. It's safe and avoids immediate conflict with Snake #1\n2. It brings me to (1,5), which is just 1 move away from the apple at (1,6)\n3. It maintains my position on the left side of the board\n4. From (1,5), I can still reach (0,6) if needed\n5. This move keeps me flexible and closer to immediate apple opportunities\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nFocus on collecting the remaining apples at (1,6), (0,6), (0,2), and (8,8) while maintaining distance from Snake #1. Avoid head-on collisions and keep multiple movement options open. Move methodically toward the left side of the board where apples are concentrated, but prioritize the closest immediate opportunities. Snake #1 is ahead with 6 apples, so I need to be efficient in collecting apples while avoiding confrontation.\n\nUP",

I need to catch up to Snake #1's 9 apples, and these are the closest available targets. I should avoid moving into the bottom area where Snake #1 is positioned, and instead work my way up and across the board toward the apples. The game is at turn 36/150, so I have time to be strategic about positioning. I should monitor Snake #1's movements carefully and avoid head-on collisions while working toward the apples that are less likely to be contested by Snake #1. I should prioritize the apple at (4,7) if safe, then (6,8) and then (6,7), and finally (8,8). I need to be careful not to get boxed in by my own body or by Snake #1's movements. The move DOWN to (4,7) is the most immediate apple collection and positions me well for future apples.\n\nDOWN",
