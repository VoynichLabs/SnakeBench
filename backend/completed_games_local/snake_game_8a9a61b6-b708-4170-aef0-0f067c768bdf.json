The nearest apples are located at (0, 7) and (0, 8), directly above me in the same column. As demonstrated in a pathfinding-focused Snake implementation on [github.com](https://github.com/nataliaarseniuk/Snake-Game), a priority should be moving efficiently toward food. In this case, the shortest path is a straight line UP.\n\n**Safety and Constraints:**\n\nI must adhere to the fundamental rule of avoiding collisions with walls and my own body, a core mechanic described in the [dev.to](https://dev.to/ritza/build-the-snake-game-with-pygame-546o) tutorial.\n-   **DOWN**: Moves to (0, 1). This cell is occupied by my own body segment. This results in death.\n-   **LEFT**: Moves to (-1, 2). This is outside the board boundaries. This results in death.\n-   **RIGHT**: Moves to (1, 2). This is a safe move but moves me away from the cluster of apples on the left edge.\n-   **UP**: Moves to (0, 3). This cell is empty and on the board. It brings me closer to the apples.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\n\nMy primary objective is to eat apples to grow, as highlighted by the [workshops.hackclub.com](https://workshops.hackclub.com/python_snake/) guide. The enemy snake is at (8, 5), posing no immediate threat. By moving UP, I control the left edge and can safely consume the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 8). Afterward, I can consider moving toward the center apple at (2, 4) or the bottom left apple at (8, 0) if it's still there.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n\nUP is the only move that advances toward the nearest food while maintaining safety. It sets up a clean vertical path to score points.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Continue UP along column x=0 to collect the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 8).\n- Monitor my tail position to ensure the path does not become blocked as I grow.\n- Ignore the enemy snake on the right side of the board for now.\n\nUP",

Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (9,2) is safe (empty space).  \n- **DOWN**: Moving to (8,1) is safe (empty space).  \n\n### Step 2: Evaluate safe moves  \nBoth **RIGHT** (9,2) and **DOWN** (8,1) are valid. Let's prioritize based on apples and future options:  \n- **RIGHT** leads to (9,2), which has no immediate apple. Future moves would have limited direction (LEFT is blocked by body, UP/DOWN are possible but not urgent).  \n- **DOWN** leads to (8,1), adjacent to the apple at (8,0). This move brings me closer to collecting that apple, increasing my score and growth.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nMoving **DOWN** to (8,1) is the best choice: it avoids immediate danger, brings me closer to a reachable apple, and leaves multiple safe follow-up options.  \n\nDOWN",

This move kills me.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** This is the location of my neck (first body segment). Moving backwards into my own body is fatal.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** This move is safe and keeps me on the board. However, moving towards the left wall (x=0) traps me against the edge and near my own body which occupies (0, 5) to (0, 8). This would severely limit my future movement options.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** This move is safe and keeps me on the board. It moves me into the open space of the upper board. From here, I can continue along the top edge towards the apple at (6, 8) or position myself to drop down towards the apple at (5, 5).\n\n**Strategy:**\nWith UP and DOWN being instant death, I must choose between LEFT and RIGHT. Moving RIGHT allows me to traverse the empty top edge of the board, opening up the right side which contains multiple apples ((6, 8) and (5, 5)). Moving LEFT would bottle-neck me in the corner where my long body is currently residing. Going RIGHT maximizes my freedom of movement and avoids the risk of trapping myself.\n\nRIGHT",
