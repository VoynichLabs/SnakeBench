This is directly adjacent to the apple at (5, 1). It is safe from Snake #1.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 2). This is also directly adjacent to the apple at (5, 1).\n*   **UP:** Moves to (4, 3). This moves me closer to Snake #1 and away from the nearest apple.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (3, 2). This moves away from the nearest apple.\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 5). It is likely targeting (3, 6) or moving toward the cluster on the right. Since it has a body segment at (3, 5), it cannot move LEFT to (3, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 2), I am in a good position to take (5, 1) or head toward the high-value area on the right (9, 3 and 9, 4).\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 1), I am also well-positioned for (5, 1).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe apple at (5, 1) is currently the easiest and safest to acquire. Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) puts me 1 step from (5, 1) and keeps my momentum heading toward the right side of the board where two more apples (9, 3 and 9, 4) are located. Moving DOWN is also viable, but RIGHT feels more offensive for the long-term cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move to (5, 1) to collect the apple.\n2.

Taking the apple is desirable \u2014 it increases our apples and score parity with opponent.\n- After eating at (9,4) we can likely take the apple at (9,3) next turn; be mindful that each apple eaten prevents the tail from moving that turn (we grow), so plan to turn left into x=8/x=7 after the small right-edge apple run to avoid getting trapped in the corner.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns:\n- Move DOWN to eat (9,4), then take (9,3) if still available.

By moving RIGHT now, I can secure (5, 8) and potentially (7, 9) before the enemy can reach the top-middle area.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n*   (3, 8) is far from the enemy head at (8, 3).\n*   My body is currently clustered in the top-left corner (0-2, 5-8), so moving RIGHT into the open center-top is strategically sound to avoid pinning myself against the wall.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nMove RIGHT to approach (5, 8). After (5, 8), I will assess whether to go UP for (7, 9) or pivot DOWN if the enemy moves away from (6, 4).\n\nRIGHT",

If they move up to contest them, I will evaluate if I can cut them off or if I should head toward the left-side apples at (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n\nDOWN",

If they move UP to (6, 6), we remain safe, but moving further down to (5, 5) next turn would put me in a potential head-on collision or space-contention with them for the apple at (5, 4).\n*   The apples at (6, 9) and (7, 9) are behind me.

The enemy head at (5,7) needs three moves to reach (5,4). That means we can secure (5,4) before they can.\n- If the enemy tries to contest by moving down toward us, they would have to move into the square we vacate on our way to the apple; because we will eat the apple on the second move and grow, that vacated square becomes part of our body and any enemy head moving into it would die. So contesting is either slow or suicidal for them.\n- UP is safe and forward-looking, but it doesn\u2019t secure an immediate apple and lets the opponent have time to approach other apples. RIGHT keeps us near our crowded right-side body.\n- LEFT wins an extra apple quickly while remaining safe and even deterring an aggressive contest.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to threaten (5,4).\n- On following turn take the apple at (5,4) (DOWN).

They are far enough away that they don't pose an immediate threat to the top-row apples.\n\n**Move Options from (6, 8):**\n1. **UP (6, 9):** Safe. This eats an apple and puts me in a prime position to grab (7, 9) or (4, 9).\n2. **DOWN (6, 7):** **DEATH.** This is my neck/body.\n3. **LEFT (5, 8):** **DEATH.** This is my body.\n4. **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. Open space, but moves away from the immediate apple at (6, 9).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Moving **UP** to (6, 9) is the most efficient move. It secures a point and places me next to two other apples.\n- To the left (5, 9), there is an apple at (4, 9). To the right (7, 9), there is another apple. \n- My body currently occupies much of row 8 (from x=1 to x=6), but as I move into row 9, row 8 will start to clear behind me.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (6, 9) this turn. Next, I will evaluate whether to go for (7, 9) or (4, 9). Since (7, 9) is a corner-adjacent apple, grabbing it then doubling back to the left along the top row to get (4, 9) seems the most efficient way to sweep the top while keeping my body trailing behind in a predictable path.\n\nUP",

Moves into the top-right corner.\n    - **DOWN (8, 8):** SAFE. Moves into row 8.\n- **Snake #1:** Head at (3, 5). They are somewhat isolated from me currently, but moving towards the center.\n- **Apples:** (4, 9) is the closest but currently blocked by my own body at (6, 9) and (7, 9). Other apples at (3, 6), (0, 6) are on the left side.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (9, 9), I hit the corner. From (9, 9), my only safe move next turn would be DOWN to (9, 8).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (8, 8), I enter the space below the top edge. Looking at the board, (8, 8) is currently empty. My body segment at (6, 8) is moving toward (2, 8). This path (row 8) is currently a long corridor.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (9, 9) first is a \"waiting move.\" It allows my body segments at row 8 to clear out further before I descend. If I move DOWN to (8, 8) now, I'm heading towards my own tail-end (2, 8) and moving into a potentially tighter space. Moving to (9, 9) buys one more turn for the body at (6, 8), (5, 8), etc., to move forward, opening up more room in the middle of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (9, 9), then move down the far right wall. Once the \"wall\" created by my body at row 8 and row 9 clears (as the tail at 2, 8 moves), I will have a clear path to sweep back across the board from right to left to collect the apples at (4, 9), (3, 6), and the column 0 apples.\n\nRIGHT",

No enemy head/body threatens that cell this turn. Eating it gains an apple and still leaves multiple exits (LEFT to head toward the x=0 apples, UP to continue north, or RIGHT to rejoin corridor toward (4,9) if needed).\n\nLong-term plan: take the apple at (3,6) now to widen our lead, then push west (x decreasing) to collect the cluster at x=0 (0,6, 0,2, 0,1).

There is no immediate threat of a head-on collision.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nApples are at (0, 1), (0, 2), (4, 9), (0, 6), and (5, 0). (4, 9) is currently trapped behind my body. (5, 0) and the cluster at (0, 1), (0, 2) are the primary long-term targets. \n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 7) is the most conservative and strategic choice. It keeps me along the wall, maximizes the space available to me as my tail moves out of the top-left, and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN the right wall toward (9, 0). Once I reach the bottom right, I will head LEFT toward the apple at (5, 0). This path allows my long body to trailing behind me safely along the perimeter, preventing me from cutting myself off in the center of the board.\n\nDOWN",

This is the most efficient path toward the bottom-right corner and the apple at (5, 0).

While safe, Snake #1 has a significant presence in the middle rows (y=4, 5, 6). Entering the middle now might lead to a confrontation or restricted movement before my tail has fully cleared the path behind me.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nHead at (0, 5). They are currently far to the west. Their body is coiled in the middle-left area. They pose no immediate threat to the (9, 4) position.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\n- Closest target: (5, 0)\n- Secondary targets: (0, 1), (0, 2)\nThe plan is to descend the right edge (x=9) to the bottom row, then sweep left along y=0 or y=1 to collect the cluster of apples in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue DOWN to (9, 0). This clears the upper-right corner effectively. Once at the bottom, head LEFT toward (5, 0).\n\nDOWN",

By staying on the x=9 column, I keep maximum distance from Snake #1 and ensure my body trailing behind me eventually clears the top and right side of the board.\n2.  **LEFT (8, 2):** This moves toward the center (x=8). While safe, it doesn't offer a direct benefit over moving down the wall. It's better to stay along the edge to maximize the open area in the middle for later maneuvers.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nHead is at (0, 2). They are very close to the apples at (0, 1) and (2, 3). Their body is somewhat tangled in the middle-left. They pose no immediate threat to my position on the right.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed DOWN to (9, 0), then move LEFT along the bottom edge to (5, 0) to collect the apple and potentially (0, 1) thereafter, depending on Snake #1's movements. This keeps me along the boundary and maintains a clear \"inner\" board for future navigation.\n\nDOWN",

This keeps momentum on apples and is consistent with the short plan from the previous turn.\n\nShort plan (for next few turns): take (0,1) now, then step right to (1,1)/(1,2) to avoid getting boxed in along x=0 by my own body. From there head toward reachable apples (e.g., (2,3) then the cluster around x=4..5) while maintaining space to maneuver and avoiding tight corridors near my torso.\n\nDOWN",

Their only safe moves are UP (1, 2) or RIGHT (2, 1). They are significantly closer to the apple at (2, 3) and (5, 0) than I am.

From there, I will evaluate the positions of the remaining apples (4, 7), (4, 9), (0, 8), and (2, 3) based on where Snake #1 moves.

My head will be at (5, 0) and my length will increase. Snake #1's head is at (2, 3), which is 5 units away (Manhattan distance). There is no immediate threat of a head-on collision at (5, 0).\n2.  **UP (6, 1):** This move is safe but ignores the immediate apple. It moves me closer to the center of the board but yields the easiest point.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 (Head: 2, 3) is fairly long and occupies a significant portion of the left side. Their most likely targets are (0, 0) or (4, 4)/ (4, 5) area. They are currently heading towards the center.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTake the apple at (5, 0). After this, I will be at (5, 0) with walls to my bottom and body segments to my right. My next priority should be moving UP or LEFT to avoid getting trapped against the bottom edge. The apple at (4, 7) or (4, 9) should be the next long-term target, as Snake #1 is currently blocking the path to the left (0, 0 and 0, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 0) to eat the apple. On the next turn, move UP toward (5, 1) to maintain mobility and start navigating toward the apples at (4, 7) or (4, 9).\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 could move to (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 3) [backwards - illegal], or (4, 2). \n- If Snake #1 moves to (5, 3) or (4, 2) while I am at (5, 2), we will be adjacent.\n- If Snake #1 moves to (4, 2) this turn while I move to (5, 2), we are safe this turn.\n\nHowever, Snake #1's body is currently forming a C-shape on the left. Moving into the center (5, 2) is aggressive but yields a point.

My board position is currently slightly restricted by my own body wrapping around the bottom right.\nIf I move **UP (6, 4)**, I begin my ascent to contest the upper apples or at least maintain a position where I can intercept the apple at (2, 4) or move towards the top-left ones.\n**RIGHT (7, 3)** is also safe, but moving UP is more proactive for getting back into the game scoring-wise.\nThe enemy snake is 2 units left and 3 units up from me. If I move UP to (6, 4), and they move RIGHT to (5, 6), we are still separated.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to gain vertical ground. Avoid the bottom-right corner where I might get boxed in by my own growing body. Focus on reaching the upper-middle area (x=4-6, y=7-9) to compete for the apples, as the enemy snake currently has a lead and better access to the left-side apples.\n\nUP",

Moves toward the center/top area. It keeps me away from the enemy's vertical wall at x=4 and moves me closer to the apple at (9, 6).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 4):** ILLEGAL. This is my body/neck.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** Safe. However, this moves me closer to the enemy's body (x=4) and reduces maneuvering space.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the enemy and toward the apple at (9, 6).\n\n**Strategy:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (4, 8) and will likely go for the apple at (4, 9) or (0, 8). I am currently cut off from the apples on the left side (0, 8), (0, 0), and (2, 4) by the enemy's long body wall at x=4.\nThe apple at (9, 6) is my best immediate target. To get there efficiently while maintaining safety:\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 5) puts me on a direct path to (9, 6).\n- Moving **UP** to (6, 6) is also viable but slightly less direct for that specific apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is very long and occupies most of the left side. My own tail is clustered at the bottom. By moving **RIGHT**, I claim the open space on the right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (9, 6). After that, monitor Snake #1. If they move further up to (4, 9), they might become slightly trapped or forced to loop back. Use my position on the right to navigate toward the top or bottom depending on where new apples spawn. Avoid the \"pocket\" created by my tail at the bottom right.\n\nRIGHT",

From my current position at (7, 5), moving **RIGHT** or **UP** are both productive. However, moving **RIGHT** to (8, 5) followed by **UP** to (8, 6) then **RIGHT** to (9, 6) is a very efficient path that keeps me in the most open area of the board (the right side). \n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is likely to be taken by Snake #1. My priority is to secure (9, 6) and then move toward the bottom-left apples (0, 0) or (2, 4) if the enemy head clears out of the top region.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove toward (9, 6) by going RIGHT then UP.

Keeps me along the right wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the bottom-right corner.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** ILLEGAL. This is my own neck.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** ILLEGAL. Off the board.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nWith the apple at (9, 6) now consumed, I am tucked against the right wall. My current body forms a wall through the center-right.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1, 9) and is very long. It occupies a large portion of the left side.\n*   **Apples:** Most apples are on the far left (x=0 to x=3). To reach them, I will eventually have to navigate around or through the gaps in the enemy snake.\n*   **Space:** The area (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) is open. Moving UP allows me to utilize the top-right corner or wait for the enemy to move. Moving DOWN (9, 5) puts me closer to the fruit at (0, 0), but I have to pass my own body \"wall\" at y=5 or y=0.\n\nMoving UP is generally safer to maintain spacing and see where Snake #1 commits. However, DOWN starts the journey toward the cluster of apples in the lower-left. Given Snake #1's head is at (1, 9), it will likely claim (0, 8) soon. I should head toward the lower apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (9, 7) to keep options open along the top or move toward the center. Since I am at the edge, UP or DOWN are my only choices. UP keeps me furthest from the enemy's current head position.\n\nUP",

That would get the apple but leaves me with only one immediate safe follow-up from (0,9), increasing the chance of getting trapped along the wall later.\n- DOWN reaches (1,8) which still allows several safe follow-up moves (LEFT to (0,8) to take the apple, RIGHT to (2,8), or further DOWN). It reaches the same nearby apple in two moves but keeps more escape options and avoids committing to the wall immediately.\n\nNo enemy head is close enough to contest (0,8) this turn. Moving DOWN is the safer play: it still gets me to the (0,8) apple next turn while preserving more mobility and reducing the risk of getting boxed against the left wall.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move DOWN to (1,8) now, then LEFT to (0,8) to collect that apple.\n- After eating, avoid hugging the left edge; use (1,7)/(2,7) or swing right to access apples at (2,4),(3,4),(1,3) while keeping an exit route and monitoring enemy movement.\n\nDOWN",

It just ate the apple that was at (0, 8) last turn.\n- Space in the top-right (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9) is open.\n- If I move **LEFT** to (8, 8), I begin moving toward the cluster of apples at (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4). However, my own body at (8, 6) and (7, 5) creates a bit of a barrier.\n- If I move **UP** to (9, 9), I keep the corner for maneuvering.\n\nGiven that the enemy is far away at (0, 8) and currently moving away from me or within its own loop, I have room to maneuver. Moving LEFT now is more proactive for getting toward the apples and preventing myself from getting stuck in the (9, 9) corner without a clear exit.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 8). This starts the journey across the top toward the center and the apples. I will monitor Snake #1's movement to see if it moves to block the middle.\n\nLEFT",

I need to be careful not to trap myself against the right wall or my own segments at x=5/6.\n- Moving **UP** to (8, 9) allows me to sweep across the very top of the board (y=9), which is currently completely empty. This gives me a clear path to get behind the enemy's position or drop down toward the apples later.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (7, 8) is also good but puts me closer to the center where the enemy might eventually emerge.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (8, 7) heading towards (8, 6) is risky because (8, 6) is part of my body. It limits immediate space.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 9). This utilizes the empty top row to navigate toward the left side of the board without getting tangled in the middle-right body segments. From the top row, I can eventually descend to target the cluster of apples at (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n\nUP",

Their body is massive and creates a wall across the center (x=4) and cycles through the bottom-left quadrant.\n- **Safety Check:**\n    - **UP:** (7, 10) - Out of bounds (OFF BOARD).\n    - **DOWN:** (7, 8) - Safe. This move stays within the board and avoids all bodies.\n    - **LEFT:** (6, 9) - Safe. This continues movement along the top edge.\n    - **RIGHT:** (8, 9) - Backwards into neck (BODY).\n- **Evaluating Safe Moves (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n    - **LEFT (6, 9):** Keeps me on the perimeter. Snake #1's head at (2, 7) is likely moving either RIGHT toward (3, 7) or DOWN toward (2, 6). If I move left, I remain far from their head but continue towards the dense center-left area where most apples are.\n    - **DOWN (7, 8):** This moves me into the open space in the top-right quadrant. However, it restricts my pathing more than staying on the top edge would for now.\n- **Strategic Plan:** Snake #1 has a very long body (19 length). They are currently occupying a lot of the reachable apple space (0,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4). My best bet is to stay alive and wait for their tail to clear out of the bottom area or for them to trap themselves in their own maze. Moving LEFT is the most \"open\" move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving along the top (y=9) towards the left as long as it's safe. Once I reach the x=5 or x=4 mark, I will evaluate if I can drop down behind Snake #1's tail or if I need to circle back. The goal is to avoid getting squeezed against the wall by Snake #1's long body.\n\nLEFT",

That risks getting boxed in quickly.\n- RIGHT -> (3,7) is legal and keeps options, but it moves me around the x=4 body wall and is slightly less direct to the nearby apple cluster.\n- DOWN -> (2,6) is legal and directly moves toward the apple cluster at (2,4),(1,3),(3,4). No enemy head is nearby, and I have multiple follow-up options after moving down.\n\nShort plan: move DOWN now toward the cluster. Next turns likely continue DOWN to (2,5) then (2,4) to eat that apple, then branch to (1,3) or (3,4) depending on enemy movement and available space. Avoid moving back toward the crowded top (y=9) where my body forms walls.\n\nDOWN",

This moves into the open space in the top middle.\n    - **LEFT:** (5, 9) - Safe. This continues along the top edge toward the left side.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n- **Snake #1's Situation:** Their head is at (2, 6) and their body is extremely long (19 segments), currently blocking off the middle-left area and much of the bottom. Their tail is at (2, 1). \n- **LEFT (5, 9):** Continuing left stays on the top wall. However, Snake #1 occupies x=4 from y=3 to y=9 (mostly). Going to (5, 9) is safe this turn, but if I continue to (4, 9), I will be directly adjacent to their body at (4, 9), (4, 8), etc. \n- **DOWN (6, 8):** This moves into the (6, 8) / (7, 8) / (5, 8) pocket of empty space. \n\n**Decision:**\nStaying along the top wall with **LEFT** (5, 9) is generally better for mobility and maintaining distance from Snake #1's head. Snake #1 is currently coiled in the bottom-left and moving toward the center-left. By moving LEFT, I can position myself to potentially dive down when their tail clears or if an opening appears in the middle (x=5 corridor).\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nKeep moving along the top or upper-middle to avoid getting pinned against the right wall. Snake #1's massive body is a hazard; I must wait for them to condense or trap themselves. My goal is to stay flexible and eventually reach the clusters of apples at (0,0), (1,3), (2,4), (3,4) once Snake #1's tail moves out of the way.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1\u2019s head is at (2, 5), currently moving through the middle-left. Snake #1\u2019s body forms a massive wall at x=4 from y=3 up to y=9. By moving down, I am entering the space between my own body (right) and the enemy's body (left). I need to be careful not to get trapped as I move lower. My tail is at (6, 4), and as it moves, it will eventually open up space for me to loop back towards the right or down towards the apples.\n\n**Strategy Note:** \nFollow the available space down the x=5 column. Snake #1 is very long and has limited room to maneuver in the bottom-left quadrant. I must avoid being pinned against the wall at x=4. Once I reach y=6 or y=7, I can assess if I should cut right (over my own body as it clears) or continue down if Snake #1 moves out of the bottom-center area.\n\nDOWN",

My body segment at (6, 9) will move to (5, 9) this turn. This move is safe.\n    - **DOWN:** (5, 7) - This cell is currently empty. This move is safe.\n    - **LEFT:** (4, 8) - Into Snake #1's body at (4, 8) (DEAD).\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Snake #1 has a massive body wall at x=4 (from y=3 to y=9).\n- My own body currently blocks me to the right at y=9, y=6, and y=5.\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 8), I enter a pocket above my own body (segment (7, 9) will move to (6, 9)). However, I need to be careful not to trap myself in the top-right corner.\n- If I move **DOWN** to (5, 7), I continue moving through the corridor between Snake #1 (left) and my body (right).\n- Snake #1's head at (2, 4) is near apples at (1, 3) and (3, 4). They are likely to move toward those.\n- Current apples are at (0, 0), (1, 3), (3, 4), (9, 3), and (4, 1).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the most flexible. It keeps me in the center of the board, allowing me to potentially reach apples at (3, 4) or (4, 1) once Snake #1 clears out or once my own body at y=5 moves out of the way. Moving RIGHT at (5, 8) would put me in a very narrow 2-tile wide strip (y=7 and y=8) above my body, which is riskier.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue moving DOWN the x=5 column. As my tail at (6, 5) moves, it will open up the middle-right area. I will look for an opening to move RIGHT or continue DOWN towards the apples at (4, 1) or (0, 0) depending on Snake #1's movement.\n\nDOWN",

On the following turn, prefer UP to (3,5) to maintain space.\n- Then head west and down toward (1,3) and (0,0), avoiding moving back into the x=4 corridor where my body forms a wall.\n- Be cautious about growing (tail freeze) for one turn after each apple \u2014 avoid tight cells adjacent to my body.\n\nRIGHT",

My body segment at (8, 6) will move, but (5, 6) is well within the \"corridor.\" This move is safe.\n    - **LEFT:** (4, 7) - Into Snake #1's body at (4, 7) (DEAD).\n    - **RIGHT:** (6, 7) - This cell is currently empty. There are no body segments currently at (6, 7). This move is safe.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- My body currently forms a wall to my right and below me (y=6, y=5). However, these segments are moving.\n- Snake #1 has a massive wall at x=4.\n- If I move **DOWN** to (5, 6), I continue down the corridor.\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 7), I enter the space to the right of my head.\n- Looking at the apples: (0, 0), (1, 3), (9, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1).\n- Snake #1 is positioned at (3, 4), very close to the apple at (1, 3).\n- My tail at (7, 5) will move this turn, and the segment at (8, 5) will move next turn. This will start opening up the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (5, 6) is the most logical step to maintain momentum toward the cluster of apples at the bottom (4, 1 and 5, 1). Moving right puts me in a tighter space between my upper body and middle body segments. By going down, I stay parallel to Snake #1's wall and wait for my own tail to clear the path to the right or bottom.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue moving DOWN towards (5, 1) and (4, 1). Monitor Snake #1's movement; they are currently trapped by their own body to their left/up, so they must move right or down. If they move towards (4, 1), I may need to contest or divert to (9, 3).\n\nDOWN",

They are positioned to the left and slightly above my head.\n- The path to the apples at (5, 1) and (4, 1) is clear if I move DOWN. \n- Snake #1's head at (3, 6) could potentially move RIGHT to (4, 6), UP to (3, 7), or LEFT to (2, 6) (hitting body). They are mostly confined by their own tail/body currently.\n- Moving DOWN is the most efficient path toward the closest apples (5, 1) and (4, 1).\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue moving DOWN to reach (5, 1) and (4, 1). After eating those, pivot towards (9, 3) or (0, 0) depending on where Snake #1 goes and which spaces become restricted by my own growing body.\n\nDOWN",

Avoid the x=4 corridor and the enemy's column; keep at least two escape options at each step and watch for tail movements when consuming apples.\n\nUP",

This cell was just vacated by Snake #1's tail. It puts me closer to the apple at (4, 1) and (1, 3).\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 3) - Safe. Open space.\n- **DOWN:** (5, 2) - Safe. Open space. Directly on the path to (5, 1).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake #1 is extremely long (22 segments) and currently occupies most of the left/center column (x=4, x=3, x=2). However, its head is at (3, 8) moving away from the bottom area.\n- I am trailing in score (12 vs 21). I need to collect the bottom apples efficiently.\n- (5, 1) and (4, 1) are the closest apples. Moving DOWN to (5, 2) is the most direct path to (5, 1).\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 3) is also viable, but DOWN (5, 2) allows me to grab (5, 1) and then potentially pivot to (4, 1) or (9, 3).\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 2), then (5, 1) for the apple. From (5, 1), I will evaluate whether to go for (4, 1) or move right toward (9, 3). Snake #1 is currently trapped in its own mess near the top, making the bottom area relatively safe for now.\n\nDOWN",

It does not eat an apple, so my tail will move (vacating (4,4)), but none of my immediate neighbors will be vacated next turn, so I will be cramped after moving \u2014 I must look for an opening from the tail in subsequent turns or be forced to navigate along the outer loop.\n\nShort plan for next turns (for my future self): move LEFT now to survive. Immediately after, look for a route that re-uses freed tail cells (follow the tail clockwise around the board) to avoid getting boxed in. Prefer paths toward the left apple cluster later (1,3) and (0,0) once I have space; avoid the x=4/x=5 corridor while the enemy occupies that column.\n\nLEFT",
