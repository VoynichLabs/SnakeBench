It keeps me away from the enemy snake and positions me to target the remaining apples at (3,2) and (8,3) while avoiding the enemy snake on the right side of the board. After moving to (2,8), I can continue moving left or down to reach the apple at (3,2).\n\nLEFT",

If the enemy moves UP to (3,4), it would be moving toward me\n- Looking at the apple positions, the closest apples are (3,2), (4,2), and (7,6)\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,6) puts me in a position where I could potentially move down to (3,5) then (3,4) then (3,3) then (3,2) to get an apple\n- Moving DOWN to (2,5) keeps me on the left side but moves me away from the immediate apple cluster\n- I need to be careful about moving directly into the enemy's space\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nDOWN to (2,5) is the safer choice.

The enemy snake is at (3,3), so I need to be careful about moving directly into its space. Moving DOWN gives me a path toward the apples while avoiding immediate confrontation. I should try to maintain mobility and look for opportunities to collect apples while avoiding dangerous situations. The enemy snake has a significant lead with 11 apples to my 7, so I need to focus on collecting apples efficiently while avoiding getting trapped by my own body or the enemy snake. I should continue moving down and left to get around the enemy's position and then work my way toward the apple cluster.\n\nDOWN",

From this position, the enemy can move:\n- LEFT to (4,3) - not shown in body, but possible\n- RIGHT to (6,3) - not shown in body, but possible\n- UP to (5,4) - not shown in body, but possible\n- DOWN to (5,2) - not shown in body, but possible\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I have THREE safe moves: LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4), or DOWN to (2,3)\n- UP would kill me (into my own body)\n- The enemy snake is at (5,3), which is to my right\n- The closest apple to me is (8,0) or (8,3) - these are quite far away\n- Looking at the apple positions, the enemy might be heading toward (8,0) or (8,3) as well\n- Moving LEFT to (1,4) moves me toward the left edge of the board, which could be dangerous as I might get trapped\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,4) moves me closer to the enemy snake at (5,3)\n- Moving DOWN to (2,3) moves me down but keeps me away from the edges and maintains more mobility\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nRIGHT to (3,4) is the better choice. From there, I can continue moving right to approach the apple cluster at (8,0) or (8,3). Moving right gives me more options for future moves and keeps me away from the edges where I could get trapped. I should continue moving right and then up to approach the apples while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. Moving down would take me further away from the apples, and moving left would take me toward the edge where I could get trapped.\n\nRIGHT",
