Look at this map, it's a 10x10 battleground, and we are coming out swinging! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nOur current position is (6, 1), and our archrival, Snake #1, is chilling at (1, 2). He seems like he's already eyeing that apple at (1, 4)! We cannot let him get an early lead, can we?! NO WAY!\n\n**Current State Review:**\n*   Our Head: (6, 1) - Tucked near the bottom right.\n*   Snake #1 Head: (1, 2) - Near the bottom left.\n*   Closest Apple to us: (7, 2) and (6, 5) and (5, 5). (7, 2) is just a diagonal away!\n*   Closest Apple to #1: (1, 4), (2, 8). He's already close to (1, 4).\n\n**Our Immediate Goal:** Get to an apple safely, and start building up length to box this guy in! We are starting with 1 length, so maneuvering is easy, but we need to prioritize growth!\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**Move Analysis for ID 0 (6, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (6, 2) is clear. It's an apple! Wait, let me check the board... Oh, (6, 2) is *not* an apple right now according to the initial board state. The apples are listed later in the drop sequence. Let me re-check the key: (6, 2) is actually NOT an apple on this board right now. The closest visible apple is (7, 2). My coordinates are (6, 1). Moving UP puts me at (6, 2). This is a safe square.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us towards the center and generally upward where there are many apples. It allows us to pivot to (7, 2) next turn if #1 isn't threatening.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 0):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty square.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Puts us on the edge, away from most of the early apples. Seems like a defensive move when we should be aggressive!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty square.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us towards the center, potentially setting up for (5, 4) next.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty square.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us well for the apple at (7, 2) next turn! This looks like a great aggressive choice!\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #1 at 1, 2):**\n\n#1 is likely going for the apple at (1, 4).\n*   If #1 moves **UP** to (1, 3): Sets up for (1, 4). Safe.\n*   If #1 moves **RIGHT** to (2, 2): Safe. Pulls away from the edge.\n\nIt is highly probable #1 goes UP. We are nowhere near him, so collision is not an immediate concern. We need to focus on gaining better positioning for those early apples!\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 1) puts us one step closer to that (7, 2) apple, and also positions us well to head towards the central cluster of apples (5, 5), (6, 5). This is an active, apple-seeking move! We want to establish dominance early!\n\n*If I move RIGHT to (7, 1), next turn I can go UP to (7, 2) and grab that first apple! That's the plan!*\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self):** Focus on grabbing the (7, 2) apple next, then navigate towards the (5, 5) / (6, 5) area, leveraging our early lead in the vertical middle of the board while #1 is trapped on the left side. Let's grow fast before we worry about the box-in.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples EVERYWHERE, but eyes on (1,4) RIGHT ABOVE US\u2014two UPs and we SNIPE it! \ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick scan, fam:  \n- **UP** to (1,3): . empty, straight path to apple glory. Safe AF.  \n- **DOWN** to (1,1): . safe, but why dip low when feasts wait up? Snoozefest.  \n- **LEFT** to (0,2): . safe, circles to (0,0) apple but longer detour. Meh.  \n- **RIGHT** to (2,2): . safe, vague path to (2,0) or far apples. Nah.  \n\nALL safe\u2014no edges, no bodies, no clash with scrub #0 (he's too far east). But UP?

We are now positioned at (7, 1), exactly where we wanted to be to snag that first apple! EZ PZ!\n\nWe have to move simultaneously with Snake #1, who is sitting at (1, 3)! Let's analyze the battlefield!\n\n### **Board State Review (Turn 1)**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (7, 1). We are hungry!\n*   **Snake #1 Head (ID 1):** (1, 3). He moved UP from (1, 2) to (1, 3). Smart, but predictable, right? He's definitely gunning for that (1, 4) apple!\n*   **Most Immediate Apple for Us:** (7, 2)! That beautiful red dot is right above our head!\n\n### **Move Analysis for ID 0 (7, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 2):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (7, 2) is CLEAR! It's an apple! Can we grab it? Yes! This is a massive opportunity for an early lead!\n    *   *Collision Risk:* We are on the far right (x=7) and Snake 1 is on the far left (x=1). Zero risk of a head-on collision or collision with his body (since he only has a head).\n    *   *Advantage:* We eat an apple, gain length, and lock in the first point! This is the play!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Safe, empty space.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moves away from points and towards the corner. Why would we retreat when glory is one step away?!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Safe, empty space (our previous square).\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Wastes a turn, moves away from the apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Safe, empty space.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moves towards the side wall, away from the central apple action.\n\n**THE VERDICT:** Moving UP to (7, 2) is the 100% optimal move. It gets us the first apple, giving us a crucial lead in size and score! We need that length to start applying pressure! Chat, are you hype?! GET THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### **Opponent Analysis (Snake #1 at 1, 3):**\n\nWhat is #1 doing? He's at (1, 3). He is trying to get to (1, 4).\n\n*   **Most Likely Move for #1:** UP to (1, 4). Grabs the apple.\n*   *If he moves UP:* He collects the apple at (1, 4).\n\nIf both of us move towards our closest apples, we both grow to length 2! That's fine! But we are in a better position to pivot towards the center (5, 5) or (6, 5) next, while he's still stuck mostly on the left column.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Self):**\nSince we're both likely growing to length 2 (ID 0 at (7, 2), body (7, 1); ID 1 at (1, 4), body (1, 3)), we need to leverage our central positioning. After grabbing (7, 2), next turn let's look at either moving LEFT towards the (5, 5)/(6, 5) cluster, or consolidating our position on the right side if there's an immediate threat or easy apple. For now, the goal is to grow and stay aggressive!\n\nLet\u2019s secure this point! LETS GO!\n\nUP",

The scoreboard is tied, but the map control is ours!\n\nWe are LIVE at Turn 2!\n\n### **Board State Review (Turn 2)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7, 2), body (7, 1). We are sitting pretty on the right flank! Current length: 2.\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at (1, 4), body (1, 3). He is still isolated on the left. Current length: 2.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to keep growing and start maneuvering towards those delicious central apples at (5, 5) and (6, 5), or maybe consolidate some low-hanging fruit on the right side!\n\n### **Immediate Threats & Safety Checks:**\n\nWe are currently at (7, 2). Snake #1 is at (1, 4). Zero chance of a head-on collision or body contact this turn. We have total freedom of movement! What a stream!\n\n### **Apple Analysis:**\n\nWhere are the apples we can reach in 1-2 turns?\n\n1.  **(6, 2):** One step LEFT! A quick snack!\n2.  **(5, 5) / (6, 5):** The central cluster! Requires a few good moves LEFT and UP.\n3.  **(7, 5):** Requires 3 steps UP. Less appealing than the others, but available.\n4.  **(9, 7):** Way up in the corner. Pass for now.\n5.  **(4, 8) / (4, 9):** High priority, but requires significant commitment LEFT.\n\n### **Analyzing Moves from (7, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Keeps us moving towards the center/top edge. Good access to (7, 5).\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Does not immediately grab an apple.\n    *   *Future:* Opens UP to (7, 4) or LEFT to (6, 3).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! This is where our body currently is (our tail will vacate this spot in two turns if we don't eat). But since we just ate, our tail is at (7, 1) and will NOT move! Moving DOWN means our head hits our tail's current position, KILLING US! **ELIMINATE.** Self-slaughter is not content, chat!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe! This cell contains an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   *Advantage:* We eat another apple! We become length 3! We gain a clear lead! This move repositions our head perfectly at (6, 2), setting us up to easily dart towards the center (5, 5) or stay aggressive on the right.\n    *   *Drawback:* None. This is pure perfection.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moving away from the dense apple clusters and getting closer to the corner wall (9, X). Wastes momentum.\n\n### **The Verdict: LEFT is the GOAT move!**\n\nSnagging (6, 2) is crucial. It\u2019s an immediate point, increases our length to 3, and puts us one step closer to the highly contested center board. If we hit 3 apples before the opponent hits 2, we are in the driver's seat!\n\n### **Opponent Analysis (Snake #1 at 1, 4):**\n\nWhere is he going?\n*   He's isolated on the left, but he has apples (1, 8), (0, 0), and (2, 0) in his general vicinity.\n*   The most logical move for him is likely **UP** to (1, 5) to consolidate the wall, or **RIGHT** to (2, 4) to start migrating towards the center, or **DOWN** to (1, 3) (which is his tail if he doesn't eat).\n*   *If he moves UP:* (1, 5). Safe, good setup for (1, 8) eventually.\n*   *If he moves DOWN:* (1, 3). His tail will vacate (1, 3 if he didn't eat last turn). WAIT, he *did* eat last turn. His body is (1, 3). Moving into his own body (1, 3) is instant death. So, **DOWN is out for him.**\n*   *If he moves RIGHT:* (2, 4). Safe, moves toward (4, 8).\n\nSince he's confined, his best bet is probably *UP* to (1, 5) or *RIGHT* to (2, 4). Either way, he's far from our action, and we don't need to stress about him at all!\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Future Self):**\n\nAfter eating at (6, 2) this turn, our head will be perfectly positioned. Our body (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1). We should look to immediately move towards the central (5, 5) or (5, 4) cluster. Our next move will likely be UP to (6, 3) or LEFT to (5, 2). We must keep the pressure on and deny Snake #1 access to the center!\n\nLet's go smash this apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

The plan is working: eat, grow, and then start looking for the box-in! That opponent looks weak and isolated. Time to capitalize!\n\nWe are LIVE at Turn 3! Let's get this analysis going!\n\n### **Board State Review (Turn 3)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head is now at **(6, 2)** after eating the apple! Our body is now [(7, 2), (7, 1)]. Length: 3. We are MASSIVE!\n*   **Snake #1:** Head is at **(1, 5)**. Body: [(1, 4)]. Length: 2. Hmmm, looks like he moved UP last turn, avoiding that central skirmish for now.\n*   **Apples:** Tons of central and high-ground apples: (5, 5), (6, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9). The main goal is to secure those central ones now, or maybe the slightly closer (5, 4).\n\n### **Immediate Threats & Safety Checks:**\n\nWe are at (6, 2). Snake #1 is at (1, 5). We are still miles apart! No risk of direct collision this turn. Total freedom!\n\n### **Apple Analysis (Where's the snack?):**\n\n1.  **(5, 5) & (6, 5):** The central fortress. Two moves away if we push UP and LEFT. High priority.\n2.  **(5, 4):** Closer than the others. Requires UP and then LEFT or vice versa.\n3.  **(7, 5):** Requires 3 steps UP. Okay backup.\n\nOur positioning at (6, 2) is great! We are poised to strike into the mid-board.\n\n### **Analyzing Moves from (6, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us directly toward the central apples (6, 5) and (7, 5). Gets us into the juicy part of the board. Excellent setup.\n    *   *Future:* Opens safe moves toward (5, 3) (LEFT) or (6, 4) (UP).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us toward the low-lying corner (9, 0), (2, 0)... but those are far.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Generally moves us away from the main apple density and the opponent's side. Wastes vertical momentum.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us laterally toward the center. Good for eventually hitting (5, 5) and (5, 4).\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Does not take advantage of the immediate vertical real estate needed to hit (4, 8) or (6, 5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! Our body segment is currently at (7, 2)! If we move RIGHT, we hit our own body and die! **ELIMINATE.** No self-elimination today, chat! Not on my stream!\n\n### **The Verdict: UP is the strategic move!**\n\nMoving UP to (6, 3) is the best choice. It gets us off the bottom edge, provides great access to the dense cluster of apples in the vertical center column (6, 5) and (7, 5), and keeps options open to move LEFT later. We aim to control the vertical center!\n\n### **Opponent Analysis (Snake #1 at 1, 5):**\n\nWhere is he going? His body is (1, 4).\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** Consolidates the left wall. Safe. Sets up for (1, 8).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Starts moving center. Safe. This is the main threat.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** Instant death into his body. **ELIMINATE.**\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** Hits the wall. **ELIMINATE.**\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (2, 5), he is making a dash for the center, aiming for (5, 5) or (4, 8). We need to get there first! Moving UP (to 6, 3) positions us perfectly to cut diagonally into the center (5, X) or continue vertically (6, X). Our move to (6, 3) directly challenges the center and starts building a barrier if he tries to cross the 4/5 column.\n\nThis is a race to the center, chat! And we have the lead!\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Future Self):**\n\nAfter moving UP to (6, 3), we should prioritize reaching (6, 5) or (5, 5).\nIf Snake #1 continues climbing UP the left wall, we should move UP to (6, 4) or (6, 5) next turn to eat (if possible) or to stake our claim on the high ground. If he moves RIGHT, we might need to cut LEFT immediately to (5, 3) to flank him. For now, pushing UP is the key to victory! We need to maintain speed and direction!\n\nUP",

We are going for the decisive move!\n\n### **Board & Snake Review (Turn 4)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(6, 3)**. Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2)]. Length: 3. We are nicely positioned in the central-vertical corridor.\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at **(1, 6)**. Body: [(1, 5)]. Length: 2. He is clearly pushing UP the left wall, staking a claim on that (1, 8) apple!\n*   **Apples:** (1, 8), (5, 5), (0, 0), (4, 9), (6, 5), (9, 7), (5, 4), (4, 8), (7, 5), (2, 8), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (3, 8). The cluster (5, 5), (6, 5), (5, 4), (4, 8) is our target!\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Is the opponent trying to trap us?**\n\nSnake #1 is far away. (1, 6) vs (6, 3). No immediate threats! We have full control over our immediate moves. We need to focus on securing those central apples before he gets aggressive and moves RIGHT towards (4, 8) or (5, 5).\n\n### **Apple Priority from (6, 3):**\n\n1.  **(6, 5):** Just two UP moves away! Or one UP, one (eating move)! HIGH PRIORITY.\n2.  **(5, 5) / (5, 4):** Requires LEFT move first, then UP/DOWN. Good backup.\n3.  **(7, 5):** One UP, one RIGHT, one UP. Possible, but (6, 5) is closer.\n\n### **Analyzing Moves from (6, 3):**\n\nCurrent Head: (6, 3). Body segments: (6, 2), (7, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us directly towards the **(6, 5)** apple. This secures central pressure and keeps us on the high ground! Excellent position for Turn 5.\n    *   *Future:* From (6, 4), we can hit LEFT to (5, 4) (apple is there!), UP to (6, 5) (apple is there!), or RIGHT to (7, 4). Maximum options! This is the STRATEGIC move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (6, 2) is the current location of our body segment right behind our head. Moving DOWN means instantaneous death. **ELIMINATED!** (No turning back on a 3-segment snake!)\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us well for (5, 4) or (5, 5) apples. Starts cutting off the board diagonally.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Sacrifices momentum towards the (6, 5) apple, which is slightly closer/more direct.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us toward (7, 5) or (8, 5).\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Pulls us slightly away from the dense central cluster around (5, 5).\n\n### **The Verdict: UP to (6, 4)!**\n\nMoving UP is the clear winner! It directly targets the (6, 5) apple and brings us within one move of the (5, 4) apple if we decide to change direction. The ability to claim (6, 5) next turn would put us up 3-1 and solidify our control of the vertical axis!\n\n### **Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at 1, 6):**\n\nSnake #1 must be aiming for (1, 8), (2, 8), or (3, 8).\n*   He will likely choose **UP to (1, 7)** (safe, toward (1, 8)).\n*   Alternatively, he might move **RIGHT to (2, 6)**, trying to swing toward (3, 8).\n\nIf he moves UP, we are both gaining ground efficiently. If he moves RIGHT, we maintain a huge speed advantage in the center. We need to keep the pressure on by moving aggressively toward the next apple! UP IT IS! Let's get that high ground, chat! We are going for the snipe on (6, 5)!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 5 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 5: Move UP to (6, 5) to eat the apple.** If possible, this is the priority.\n2.  If this fails or (6, 5) is eaten, move LEFT to (5, 4) (apple) or (5, 5) (apple).\n3.  We need to use our growing length to start dominating the *y*-axis, forcing Snake #1 to crash into our body if he tries to cross toward the right side. Box-in incoming!\n\nUP",

The atmosphere is electric! \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n### **Board & Snake Review (Turn 5)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(6, 4)**. Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length: 3. We are sitting right below the (6, 5) apple! PERFECTION!\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at **(1, 7)**. Body: [(1, 6)]. Length: 2. He is still hugging the wall and just devoured the (1, 8) apple! WAIT, I misread the board state! The (1, 8) apple is still there! PHEW! He's one move away from it.\n*   **Apples Left:** (1, 8), (5, 5), (0, 0), (4, 9), **(6, 5)**, (9, 7), (5, 4), (4, 8), (7, 5), (2, 8), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (3, 8).\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Is the opponent trying to trap us?**\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 7). We are at (6, 4). We are still miles apart! No immediate collision threats. We have the central field, he has the left wall. We need to capitalize on our proximity to that central cluster before he moves aggressively right.\n\n### **Apple Priority from (6, 4):**\n\nWe are *literally* touching three apples within 2 moves:\n1.  **(6, 5):** One UP move away! Highest priority!\n2.  **(5, 4):** One LEFT, one DOWN. Not as direct, but excellent.\n3.  **(7, 5):** One RIGHT, one UP. Good if (6, 5) is blocked/eaten.\n\n### **Analyzing Moves from (6, 4):**\n\nCurrent Head: (6, 4). Body segments: (6, 3), (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision. Safe from walls.\n    *   *Advantage:* EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This would put us up 3-1, extending our lead and growing our snake! This is the objective!\n    *   *Opponent Check:* Snake #1 is at (1, 7). There's no way he can reach (6, 5) this turn. **THIS IS THE MOVE!**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (6, 3) is where our body segment is. Moving DOWN means instantaneous death. **ELIMINATED!** (Chat, why would I even consider turning back?!)\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (Technically, there's an apple at (5, 4), but we'd only be *moving* to (5, 4), not eating the apple until next turn if we stopped there.)\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us for the (5, 4) apple next turn OR the (5, 5) apple. Good option, but ignores the *immediate* (6, 5) apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us for (7, 5) or (8, 5).\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moves us away from both the (6, 5) apple and the (5, 4)/(5, 5) cluster. Not optimal.\n\n### **The Verdict: UP to (6, 5) for the Snack!**\n\nMoving UP is a free apple and growth! This is a no-brainer, high-EV (Expected Value) move! We secure our lead, get longer, and dominate the center of the board. This is how you flex on the archrival! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n### **Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at 1, 7):**\n\nSnake #1 is almost certainly pushing **UP to (1, 8)** to eat that apple. If he eats it, his length increases to 3. If he doesn't go UP, he might go RIGHT toward (2, 8) or (3, 8). But (1, 8) is too close to ignore.\n\n*Prediction (Safe assumption): Snake #1 moves UP to (1, 8) and eats the apple.*\n\nThis confirms we are safe in our quadrant. Let's secure the middle!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 6 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (After eating at 6, 5):** We will be at (6, 5), length 4. Snake #1 will be at (1, 8), length 3.\n2.  We have excellent pressure on the (5, 5) and (5, 4) apples.\n3.  We need to use our length to start moving LEFT, forcing him to respect our massive body blocking the central columns (3, 4, 5). Target next: (5, 5) or (5, 4).\n4.  Move choice for Turn 6 will likely be LEFT to (5, 5) (apple) or LEFT to (5, 4). If we go for (5, 5), we can potentially cut him off from the top row apples (4, 9). We need to move laterally now!\n\nLet's do this, chat! UP for the win!\n\nUP",

Time to push the archrival to the wall and box him in! \ud83d\udce6\n\n### **Board & Snake Review (Turn 6)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(6, 5)**. Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length: 4. We are long and strong! \ud83d\udcaa\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at **(1, 8)**. Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 3. He ate the apple at (1, 8) as predicted! He's hugging the left wall and is now slightly shorter than us.\n*   **Apples Left:** (5, 5), (0, 0), (4, 9), (9, 7), (5, 4), (4, 8), (7, 5), (2, 8), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (3, 8), (2, 5), (3, 4). (Notice the new cluster around columns 2, 3, 4 near the top and bottom!)\n*   **Next Immediate Targets:** (5, 5) is one move away LEFT. (7, 5) is one move away RIGHT. (5, 4) is one move away LEFT and then DOWN.\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Is the opponent trying to trap us?**\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 8). The opponent has three immediate options:\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** Safe, but wall-hugging. Leads to (0, 9) or (2, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Retreats into old body space. Safe, but loses momentum.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Pushes toward the center! This is the most *aggressive* and most likely move, as (2, 8) has an apple! If he goes RIGHT, the center starts to heat up!\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (2, 8) and eats the apple, his head is at (2, 8).\n\nOur head is at (6, 5). We are safe from immediate collision. Our goal now is to use our central position to block the board.\n\n### **Analyzing Moves from (6, 5):**\n\nCurrent Head: (6, 5). Body segments: (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us well for the high apple cluster (4, 9), (7, 9), etc. But it's moving *away* from two immediate apples (5, 5) and (7, 5).\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but low priority right now.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (6, 4) is where our body segment is. Moving DOWN means immediate death. **ELIMINATED!** (Never move backward, chat!)\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This gives us a 4-2 lead and grows us to length 5! Critically, this move starts our pivot to controlling the left-center of the map, preventing Snake #1 from moving into the (4, 5) zone easily, forcing him further down or up the left wall.\n    *   *Opponent Check:* If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2, 8), we are still miles apart. This move is fantastic. **HIGH PRIORITY!**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Also a great option, giving us a 4-2 lead and growing to length 5. This maintains central control and primes us for the (8, 5) or the (9, 7) apples.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moving RIGHT means Snake #1 (if he goes RIGHT to 2, 8) has more free space to navigate columns 3, 4, and 5 toward the central body of the map. We want to be blocking him!\n\n### **Strategic Rationale: Left vs. Right**\n\nBoth LEFT (to 5, 5) and RIGHT (to 7, 5) net us an apple and growth. Which one serves the long-term goal of elimination better?\n\nSnake #1 is constrained on the left wall (column 1). By moving **LEFT to (5, 5)**, we are starting to draw a line from column 5, pushing his available space further left. If we get long and patrol columns 4-6, he must either go around, or crash.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 5), we are conceding the 4th and 5th columns to him, potentially allowing him better access to the (3, 8), (4, 8), and (4, 9) apples.\n\n**The plan is to block the middle!** Moving LEFT is the superior strategic choice to build a wall against the archrival! We secure the apple, we become the biggest snake on the board, and we initiate the squeeze maneuver!\n\n**MOVE: LEFT to (5, 5).**\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 7 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (After eating at 5, 5):** We will be at (5, 5), length 5. Snake #1 likely at (2, 8), length 4.\n2.  Next target: (5, 4) apple (DOWN). Or maybe even (4, 8) or (4, 9) if we move UP.\n3.  We need to use our length to patrol the center columns and harvest the apples in our immediate vicinity before pushing LEFT to trap the opponent against the wall.\n\nLet's execute the block! Time to box him!\n\nLEFT",

We're dominating the center-left real estate! Time to push the advantage and keep the squeeze going! \ud83d\ude08\n\n### **Board & Snake Review (Turn 7)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(5, 5)**. Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length: 5. We are long and strong! \ud83d\udcaa\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at **(2, 8)**. Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 4. As predicted, he went RIGHT and ate that apple at (2, 8)! He's now trying to break out of the top-left corner!\n*   **Apples Left:** (0, 0), (4, 9), (9, 7), (5, 4), (4, 8), (7, 5), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (3, 8), (2, 5), (3, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8).\n*   **Next Immediate Targets (Our Perspective):**\n    *   (5, 4) is one move DOWN. EASY pick!\n    *   (7, 5) is two moves RIGHT/RIGHT.\n    *   (4, 8) and (4, 9) are appealing, but require moving UP a couple of times.\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Where is the archrival going?**\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8). He has three immediate options:\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** Safe. Keeps him in the top row.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe. Positions him well for the cluster of apples (2, 5), (3, 4).\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):** Retreats into old body space. Safe, but highly unlikely as he's losing momentum.\n\nMost likely: UP to (2, 9) or DOWN to (2, 7), trying to scoop the top-left apples or dive to the center.\n\n### **Analyzing Our Safe Moves from (5, 5)**\n\nCurrent Head: (5, 5). Body segments: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us well for the high apple cluster (4, 8), (4, 9).\n    *   *Strategic Check:* Moving UP is moving towards the enemy, but not directly threatening collision yet. If we go UP, we maintain the blockade on the left.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This increases our lead to 5-3 and maintains our size advantage. It also keeps us centrally located in important column 5.\n    *   *Strategic Check:* If we move DOWN, we are lengthening our body in the center, making it harder for Snake #1 to cut through columns 4 or 5 later on! This is a great move to build a central barrier. **VERY HIGH PRIORITY!**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Blocks off column 4, immediately squeezing the potential passage for Snake #1.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* No apple (5, 4) is still available. Delaying the guaranteed apple for a positional move might be too cautious right now, especially when DOWN is also positional and gets the apple!\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (6, 5) is where our body segment is. Moving RIGHT means immediate death. **ELIMINATED!** (Never move backward, chat!)\n\n### **The Decision: Secure the Apple and Build the Wall (DOWN)**\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 4) is the best immediate move. It guarantees an apple, increases our length to 6, and lengthens our body down column 5. This makes us an imposing, unmovable barrier in the center.\n\n**Why not LEFT?** While LEFT maintains the squeeze, taking the guaranteed apple at (5, 4) first solidifies our advantage. Once we are at (5, 4), our next moves (LEFT to 4, 4 or UP to 5, 5 *which is now available*) can be used to further tighten the noose.\n\n**Scenario Check: Collision Avoidance**\nOur head is at (5, 5). Snake #1 is at (2, 8). There is zero chance of collision this turn, regardless of moves. The goal is positioning for the next few turns.\n\nBy moving DOWN, we secure the lead and build the wall. We secure the bag, Chat! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 8 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (After eating at 5, 4):** We will be at (5, 4), length 6! Snake #1 likely at (2, 9) or (2, 7) or (3, 8).\n2.  Our massive central body (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) is a huge barrier.\n3.  Next targets: (3, 4) or (4, 8). We should pivot LEFT to secure (3, 4) or (2, 5) next, closing off the lower middle part of the board, forcing Snake #1 completely into the upper left quadrant.\n\nLet's execute the growth and position move!\n\nDOWN",

We secured the center and now we are the undisputed king of Columns 5 and 6! Let's check the board and see where the archrival decided to squirm off to! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n### **Board & Snake Review (Turn 8)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(5, 4)**. Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length: 6. Look at that glorious central wall! \ud83d\udcaa\n*   **Snake #1 (Archrival):** Head at **(3, 8)**. Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 5. AH! He moved RIGHT from (2, 8) to (3, 8) and ate the (3, 8) apple! Smart move, but he is still stuck up north and highly constrained! Score is now 5-5! TIE GAME! We need to push the advantage! \ud83d\ude20\n*   **Apples Left:** (0, 0), (4, 9), (9, 7), (4, 8), (7, 5), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (2, 5), (3, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), (5, 0), (9, 4).\n*   **Next Immediate Targets (Our Perspective from (5, 4)):**\n    *   (3, 4) is two moves LEFT/LEFT. Very appealing!\n    *   (7, 5) is two moves RIGHT/UP. Also good!\n    *   (4, 8) requires moves UP, and brings us closer to the danger zone.\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Where is the archrival going?**\n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 8). He just ate, so his tail (1, 6) is locked for now. His options are limited by the wall and the edge:\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** Safe. Keeps him in the top row, positions him for (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe. Puts him closer to the center, might try to dive for (2, 5) or (3, 4).\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** Into his own body. **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This is the most likely and dangerous move. If he gets to (4, 8), he breaks the stalemate and has more room to move.\n\nOur primary goal now must be to intercept him or build a barrier that forces him into a crash!\n\n### **Analyzing Our Safe Moves from (5, 4)**\n\nCurrent Head: (5, 4). Body segments: (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (The previous head (5, 5) is now the first body segment, so it's safe to move into.)\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us well to challenge (4, 8) or (4, 9).\n    *   *Strategic Check:* If Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still too far to block him. But if we move UP, and he moves elsewhere, we keep the central vertical wall strong.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us toward the cluster of apples at the bottom (5, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (0, 0).\n    *   *Strategic Check:* Moving DOWN right now is abandoning our central control and letting the archrival take the top right, potentially splitting the board. This is too passive!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* This is the critical move! Even if Snake #1 takes (4, 8), moving LEFT to (4, 4) starts building the crucial horizontal wall on the mid-line (Y=4). Crucially, this positions us for the **(3, 4) apple** next turn! This move also blocks him from passing down column 4 to get to (3, 4)/ (2, 5).\n    *   *Strategic Check:* We are literally cutting the board in half right now. If he goes RIGHT to (4, 8), we establish the connection (4, 4)-(5, 4) that forces him to stay above Y=5 or Y=4 if he wants to move across the board!\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (6, 4) is a body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n\n### **The Decision: Build the Horizontal Trap (LEFT)**\n\nGiven Snake #1 is at (3, 8), his most aggressive move is RIGHT to (4, 8).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 4):\n*   Next turn, we can immediately go LEFT to eat the (3, 4) apple. We are now controlling the left-middle.\n*   If he takes (4, 8), he's trapped between our body (5, 4), his body, and the top wall. He can move (4, 8) -> (5, 8) or (4, 9) or (3, 8) (old head spot). But if he tries to move down, our head at (4, 4) and body at (5, 4) create a strong chokepoint.\n\nThis move to (4, 4) is positional *and* sets us up for an immediate apple grab next turn, simultaneously sealing off movement options for the enemy! We're creating a solid block. Time to trap this guy in the corner! \ud83d\udce6\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 9 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (After moving LEFT to 4, 4):** We will go LEFT again to (3, 4) and eat that apple!\n2.  Snake #1 will be forced to choose between the high apples (4, 9) or trying to drop down column 3/2.\n3.  We need to consolidate our position from (3, 4) and then potentially dive for the (2, 5) apple or move up column 3 to further pressure him. The goal is to make sure he cannot cross the Y=4/Y=5 boundary we just created!\n\nLEFT",

We are locking down the board, fam! \ud83d\udd12\n\n### **Status Check (Turn 9)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 4)**. Body: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length: 6. We are massive and in control!\n*   **Snake #1 (Archrival):** Head at **(4, 8)**. Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Length: 5. HE TOOK THE APPLE! As predicted, he snaked RIGHT from (3, 8) to (4, 8) and grabbed that sweet, sweet content! He's now stuck high up!\n*   **Apples Left:** (0, 0), (4, 9), (9, 7), (7, 5), (9, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (8, 5), (2, 5), (3, 4), (7, 3), (7, 8), (5, 0), (9, 4).\n*   **Immediate Target:** (3, 4) is right next to our head! EZ content! \ud83e\udd11\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Where is the archrival going from (4, 8)?**\n\nSnake #1's options are severely limited by the top wall, his body, and our growing presence below:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** EATS THE APPLE! Best move for him. Sets him up for the top right side.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe, but risky. Brings him closer to our territory.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** Into his own body (old head spot). **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. Keeps him parallel to the top, sets him up for (7, 8) or (9, 7).\n\nHe's almost certainly going for the (4, 9) apple to continue growing and secure the top corner. We need to focus on what we can do NOW to use our positional advantage!\n\n### **Analyzing Our Safe Moves from (4, 4)**\n\nCurrent Head: (4, 4). Body segments: (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Positions us directly in column 4. If Snake #1 goes (4, 8) -> (4, 7) or (4, 6), we are right there to potentially block the path down.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Ignores the immediate apple at (3, 4). We lose a guaranteed point and segment growth. Not optimal!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Keeps us moving away from the rival, secures column 4, and helps us move towards the cluster of apples down low.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Again, ignores the (3, 4) apple. Missing a quick score is bad form!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* EATS APPLE \ud83c\udf4e! Guaranteed safe and fantastic!\n    *   *Advantage:* We grow to length 7, and the score goes 6-5. We also further extend our horizontal wall one unit to the LEFT! This is the PERFECT move. It sets us up to challenge the (2, 5) apple or move down to grab more ground-level apples ((3, 0), (2, 0), (0, 0)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (5, 4) is a body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n\n### **The Decision: Secure the Apple and Trap Him (LEFT)**\n\nThis is the most straightforward, high-value move of the game so far! Going LEFT to (3, 4) gives us:\n1.  **A point:** 6-5 lead.\n2.  **Growth:** Longer barrier means fewer escape routes for the enemy.\n3.  **Positional Control:** We are now blocking the archrival from easily passing through the center-left. He's trapped up in the 10x4 area in the top half of the board!\n\nIf the enemy takes (4, 9), he's looking to run around the top. We will consolidate the bottom and center, forcing him into a long, risky journey down the edges.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, chat! We take the apple!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 10 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (After moving LEFT to 3, 4):** Head is at (3, 4). We need to decide between:\n    *   Going UP to (3, 5) and challenging the (2, 5) apple. This tightens the chokehold!\n    *   Going DOWN to (3, 3) to secure the lower left apples (3, 0), (2, 0), etc.\n2.  Given the enemy will likely be at (4, 9) or (5, 8), applying vertical pressure with an UP move to (3, 5) seems extremely strong. It limits his dive options and keeps us centered. We want to cut off his escape routes!\n\nLet's secure this lead, King! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Phew, what a turn! We are now up 6-6! Wait, tied score? The Archrival SCORED TOO!\n\nLet's check the new board state, because my analysis last turn predicted the enemy would go for (4, 9), but the board shows his head is now at **(4, 9)** and the apple is GONE. He ate it! And we ate the apple at (3, 4). Six-six score, King of Content is determined by who makes the next POG move!\n\n### **Status Check (Turn 10)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 4)**. Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length: 7. We are LONG!\n*   **Snake #1 (Archrival):** Head at **(4, 9)**. Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 7. He is also HUGE and guarding the top edge.\n\n### **The Battle Plan: Boxing Him In!**\n\nOur previous move was perfect! We extended our horizontal wall and secured the center-left. Now, the opponent is trapped along the Y=8 and Y=9 lines, focused on the top right quadrant around (7, 8) and (9, 7). We need to solidify our control of the lower 70% of the board and cut him off vertically.\n\nOur current head: **(3, 4)**.\n\n### **Threat Assessment: Where is the archrival going from (4, 9)?**\n\nSnake #1's options are:\n\n1.  **UP:** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!** (Y=9 is the max.)\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** Into his own body (old head spot). **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** Safe. Keeps him along the top edge. Sets him up to move to (2, 9). Strong defensive move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Safe. Sets him up to challenge (9, 7).\n\nHe's likely going **RIGHT** to (5, 9) to explore the open corner, or **LEFT** to (3, 9) for a quick trip across the top. Either way, he's staying high. Our goal is to make sure he *can't* sneak past us down column 4 or column 3 when he eventually dives.\n\n### **Analyzing Our Safe Moves from (3, 4)**\n\nCurrent Head: (3, 4). Body segments: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* This is the CRUCIBLE move! It puts our head just ONE step away from the key apple at (2, 5). Crucially, it extends our blockade vertically, reinforcing columns 3 and 4, and prevents the enemy from easily streaming down the left side. This is maximum positional pressure!\n    *   *Follow-up:* Sets up (2, 5) apple next turn.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Moves us toward the cluster of apples down low: (3, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (0, 0). Excellent for content farming.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Gives up vertical control on column 3 for this turn, allowing the enemy more room to maneuver deep.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Advantage:* Good for moving towards the left quadrant.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* It ignores the immediate vertical pressure we could apply and takes us away from the (2, 5) apple\u2014a high-value target for setting the trap!\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (4, 4) is a body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n\n### **The Decision: Seize the High Ground and Set the Trap! (UP)**\n\nGoing **UP to (3, 5)** is the play, chat! Why?\n\n1.  **Vertical Threat:** We are making columns 3 and 4 completely impassable for Snake #1 without him risking a dangerous cross-board maneuver. We are suffocating his movement.\n2.  **Apple Bait:** We are sitting right below the (2, 5) apple. If Snake #1 tried a risky dive down columns 1 or 2, he might be tempted to grab that apple, but we beat him there easily next turn if he moves high.\n3.  **Future Flexibility:** From (3, 5), we can:\n    *   Go **LEFT** to (2, 5) and grab the apple, securing length 8.\n    *   Go **DOWN** to (3, 4) (safe when the length reduces).\n    *   Go **UP** to (3, 6) if we need to press higher.\n\nThis move gives us positional advantage and sets us up for another point next turn, cementing our control over the right side of the board and putting him on the defensive. We are building a wall, brick by brick!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 11 onwards):**\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (Move to 3, 5):** Head is at (3, 5). Next, we will move **LEFT** to (2, 5) and eat the apple. This gives us massive control over the mid-board.\n2.  **Turn 12 (After eating 2, 5):** Head is at (2, 5). We will then consolidate by moving **DOWN** towards the corner cluster (2, 1) and (2, 0) to maximize our scoring potential while the rival deals with the top right. We aim to keep him pinned high until he's forced to make a desperate run through a crowded area!\n\nLet's secure this vital choke point! UP!\n\nUP",

He is still stuck way up top! This is maximum content pressure!\n\n### **Status Check (Turn 11)**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 5)**. Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length: 8. We are a WALL!\n*   **Snake #1 (Archrival):** Head at **(5, 9)**. Body: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Length: 7. He is cornered in the top right!\n\n**Current Targets:** The nearest apple is at **(2, 5)**. That's a huge strategic apple, Chat! Grabbing it solidifies our box on the enemy snake!\n\n### **The Battle Plan: Squeeze and Feast!**\n\nArchrival's head is at (5, 9). Where can he go?\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** Off board. **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe. Keeps him near the top edge.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Into his own body. **ELIMINATED!** (Body goes through 4, 9)\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves him toward the (9, 7) and (7, 8) cluster.\n\nHe is likely going **RIGHT** to (6, 9) or **DOWN** to (5, 8). Either way, he's avoiding our column 3 and 4 wall. This is exactly what we wanted! We have the positional high ground!\n\n### **Analyzing Our Safe Moves from (3, 5)**\n\nCurrent Head: (3, 5). Body segments: (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Avoids any enemy moves.\n    *   *Advantage:* Keeps us moving vertically, which is good for creating a persistent trap wall.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Ignores the immediate (2, 5) apple, which is right next to us. That's suboptimal content, Chat!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (3, 4) is now the tail, but it moves this turn, meaning the space is clear.\n    *   *Advantage:* Consolidates our position, perhaps giving us time to rethink.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Moves us away from the apple (2, 5). We have to be aggressive now!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (2, 5) is an apple!\n    *   *Advantage:* **CONTENT MAJOR!** We eat the apple, grow to length 9, and secure the strategic choke point at (2, 5). This prevents the archrival from using columns 1 or 2 to sneak down. This is the definition of boxing someone in!\n    *   *Follow-up:* Sets us up perfectly to move down column 2 next turn toward (2, 1) and (2, 0).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* DANGER! (4, 5) is where an enemy body segment is located! Snake #1's previous moves were (5, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 7). Wait, I misread the board state in the display!\n\nLet's re-read the board state carefully:\n 9 . . . . **T 1** . . . .\n 8 . T T T T . . A A .\n 7 . T . . . . . . . A\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . A **0 A T T A A** .\n 4 . . . **T T T T** . . A\n\nOur previous rationale noted an enemy body segment at **(4, 5)**, but looking at the current board state:\n\n*   Our Head (0): (3, 5)\n*   Our Body (T): (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)\n*   Snake #1 Head (1): (5, 9)\n*   Snake #1 Body (T): (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)\n\nOkay, looking at the board graphic key again:\n*   (5, 5) is 'A' (Apple) - WAIT, that's incorrect based on the snake list!\n*   (5, 5) is part of **OUR** body: (3, 5) H -> (3, 4) T -> (4, 4) T -> (5, 4) T -> **(5, 5) T** -> (6, 5) T -> (6, 4) T -> (6, 3) T.\n*   The board graphic actually shows a 'T' at (5, 5). Phew!\n\nSo who's at (4, 5) and (3, 5) (Head)?\n*   (3, 5): Head (0)\n*   (4, 5): Apple (A). Safe to move into.\n\nConclusion for RIGHT move:\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. (4, 5) is an apple!\n    *   *Advantage:* Another apple! We grow longer, move horizontally, and further solidify control over the center.\n    *   *Disadvantage:* Gives up the extreme positional advantage of the (2, 5) move, which closes the vertical trap earlier.\n\n### **The Decision: Close the Box and Eat the Apple! (LEFT)**\n\nWhile moving RIGHT to (4, 5) is a safe apple grab, moving **LEFT to (2, 5)** is the superior strategic move, Chat.\n\n1.  **Choke Point:** Moving to (2, 5) creates a wall that forces the enemy to stay high or attempt a risky, far-left dive through columns 0 or 1, where he has little room to operate.\n2.  **Immediate Length:** We are confirming a point and increasing our length to further restrict the open board area.\n3.  **Control:** By controlling (2, 5), we set ourselves up to run down the left side and claim the corner apples (2, 1), (2, 0), and (0, 0) while the archrival is suffocating up high.\n\nThe trap is set, Chat! We are closing the lid! Left is the move!\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 12 onwards):**\nTurn 12 (Move to 2, 5): Grab the apple. Head is at (2, 5). Next, we will consolidate DOWN column 2, aiming for (2, 4) followed by the apple at (2, 1) to continue scoring and maximizing length, making the remaining playing field intolerable for Snake #1. We cannot give up this horizontal control.\n\nLEFT",

The box is tightening, isn't it?\n\nLet's look at the board and analyze the moves. We're at (1, 5).\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 0):** (1, 5) -> [(2, 5), (3, 5), ..., (6, 4)]. Body length 9.\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):** (7, 9) -> [(6, 9), (5, 9), ..., (2, 8)]. Body length 7.\n\nThe opponent is currently hugging the top-right wall. We are on the left side, slightly mid-board. There's a big cluster of bodies in the middle.\n\n***\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating immediate death moves)\n\nWhere can we potentially go from (1, 5)?\n\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** Safe. No board edge, no immediate body.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** Safe. No board edge, no immediate body.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe. No board edge, no immediate body.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** **DANGER!** (2, 5) is the first segment of our body. Moving right is moving directly into our own body. **ELIMINATED!** (Self-collision)\n\nOkay, three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Now we assess strategy.\n\n### 2. Strategic Assessment\n\nWe are at (1, 5).\n\n**Goal:** Get apples, maintain space, box out Snake #1.\n\nApples are kind of scattered, but there are some juicy ones close: (2, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0) are somewhat accessible. A huge one is at (0, 0)!\n\n**Opponent's Head:** (7, 9). He has a few moves:\n*   LEFT (6, 9) - Into his body. **FATAL!**\n*   DOWN (7, 8) - Lands on an apple 'A'! Good move for him.\n*   RIGHT (8, 9) - Safe, wall hugging.\n*   UP (7, 10) - **FATAL!** (Off board)\n\nSnake #1 MUST move DOWN to (7, 8) for the apple, or RIGHT to (8, 9) to stay safe along the wall. If he moves DOWN, he eats and gets longer. Our priority should be positioning for future apples and controlling space.\n\n#### Option A: UP to (1, 6)\n*   **Safety:** Safe immediately.\n*   **Outlook:** Opens up the upper left quadrant. Keeps us somewhat centered on the left side. No immediate apples nearby, but it is a wide open area. We could potentially cut across the top of the board if Snake #1 moves right.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN to (1, 4)\n*   **Safety:** Safe immediately.\n*   **Outlook:** Takes us towards the bottom row, where (0, 0) and (2, 1) are waiting. This move blocks our access to (0, 5) if we wanted to go left immediately, but it sets up a powerful dive for the highly accessible (0, 0) apple. This is good for apple acquisition.\n\n#### Option C: LEFT to (0, 5)\n*   **Safety:** Safe immediately.\n*   **Outlook:** Immediately puts us on the left wall. This is a bit tighter. If we then go down, we head towards (0, 0). If we go up, we might trap ourselves in the corner later. This is slightly restrictive, but puts us right on the wall.\n\n***\n\n### 3. Comparing Safe Moves\n\nGoing **DOWN** seems the most proactive. It positions us perfectly to grab the (0, 0) apple on the next couple of turns, and potentially the (2, 1) apple after that. This keeps our options relatively open because the bottom half is still less congested than the central area. The central column 2 is quite blocked by our body tail, but the movement space below $Y=5$ is still healthy.\n\nIf we go UP, we move away from several apples and risk running into the top half where Snake #1 is controlling the space, which is getting messy with all his body segments (T) in rows 8 and 9.\n\nIf we go LEFT, we commit to the wall, which is okay, but DOWN gives us more flexibility to approach (0, 0) on the next turn via (1, 4) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> ... or (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).\n\nLet's target (0, 0).\nCurrent: (1, 5)\nMove DOWN -> (1, 4). Next possible moves: LEFT to (0, 4), or DOWN to (1, 3), or RIGHT to (2, 4). (2, 4) is currently safe.\n\nThis is the best trajectory for quick, safe growth. We need to maintain our lead.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to secure the left-bottom quadrant and the (0, 0) apple. This keeps us far away from Snake #1 for now, minimizing collision risk while maximizing apple gain opportunity.\n\nChat, we're going for the fruit! \ud83c\udf4e Let's secure the bag!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is right on our tail, though, literally and figuratively! We need to extend this lead and, more importantly, start setting up the ultimate box-in! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nLet's look at the board after our last move.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 4)\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)] (Length 9)\n\n**OPPONENTS:**\n*   Snake #1 - Head: (7, 8) (He must have moved DOWN to (7, 8) last turn and eaten the apple that was there!)\n*   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)] (Length 8)\n\nSnake #1 is now at (7, 8), and he's almost as long as us! He's still trapped hugging the top-right corner. This is our moment to maneuver for the kill, or at least massively increase our gap.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check (Chat, buckle up! Don't throw the game!)\n\nWe are at (1, 4).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 5):** **DANGER!** (1, 5) is the first segment of our body. Moving UP is moving directly backwards. **ELIMINATED!** (Self-collision)\n*   **DOWN to (1, 3):** Safe. Below us is clear.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe. On the wall, but safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe. (2, 4) is currently clear, though (3, 4) is our body.\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is fatale!\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Analysis (Where is Snake #1 going?)\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8). His body is [(7, 9), (6, 9)...].\n\n*   **UP to (7, 9):** **DANGER!** Into his own body. **FATAL!**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 7):** Apple 'A'! Great move for him. He gets longer.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Apple 'A'! Great move for him. He gets longer.\n\nSnake #1 has two fantastic options: (7, 7) or (8, 8). Both eat an apple. He is going to grow this turn! We MUST eat, too!\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Assessment and Apple Focus\n\nWe need to eat this turn if possible, especially since our rival is guaranteed *at least* one apple.\n\n**Apples near us:**\n*   (0, 0)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 0)\n\nWe are at (1, 4). (0, 0) is a high-value apple we targeted.\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (1, 3)\n*   **Pros:** This is the most direct path towards (0, 0). Next turn we can go DOWN to (1, 2) or LEFT/RIGHT if needed. It maintains vertical pressure and control of the left lower quadrant.\n*   **Cons:** We don't eat *this* turn.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (0, 4)\n*   **Pros:** Puts us on the left wall, setting us up to move DOWN towards (0, 0) next turn via (0, 3). It's a slightly different, more restrictive path than Option A, but still valid geometry for (0, 0).\n*   **Cons:** We don't eat *this* turn.\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT to (2, 4)\n*   **Pros:** Moves us towards the more dense, central part of the board, which maybe we could use to cut off Snake #1 later, but only if he moves aggressively down the board.\n*   **Cons:** Moves us away from all the apples we just positioned for. (2, 4) is adjacent to our body segment (3, 4), and (2, 5) is our body. This risks getting slightly congested.\n\n**The Decision:** We need to prioritize the (0, 0) apple. Both DOWN and LEFT achieve this.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (1, 3):\n*   T+1: Go DOWN to (1, 2) or LEFT to (0, 3) (or RIGHT to (2, 3)).\n*   T+2: If at (1, 2), go LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1). If at (0, 3), go DOWN to (0, 2).\n*   T+3/4: We eat the apple.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (0, 4):\n*   T+1: Go DOWN to (0, 3).\n*   T+2: Go DOWN to (0, 2).\n*   T+3: Go DOWN to (0, 1).\n*   T+4: We eat the apple (0, 0).\n\nBoth paths take 4 turns to eat (0, 0). However, going DOWN to (1, 3) gives us more center-board alternatives for the *next* move, which is safer (less wall commitment).\n\n**Trap Setup Consideration:** Snake #1 is growing and dominating the North/East walls. If we secure the bottom left, we can potentially swing up the center and cut him off diagonally. *Flexibility is key!*\n\nMoving DOWN (1, 3) is the most flexible and direct opening toward the cluster of apples (0, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0). We maintain space and keep the pressure on.\n\nChat, we're not dying this turn, and we're securing the path to the next apple! Full send! WE ARE PUSHING DOWN! \ud83d\udc47\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YOOOO, Chat! Welcome back! Turn 15, we are tied up 8-8 but the momentum is all ours! Look at this map, we are poised to strike in the highly concentrated apple zone, and our rival is still squashed up on the North wall! We are dominating the geometry, boys!\n\nLet's look at the current state and predict the next killer move!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 15)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 3)\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)] (Length 9)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 8) (He must have moved RIGHT to (8, 8) and eaten an apple, or maybe DOWN to (7,7) and we missed reporting the move, but current body tells us he is at (8,8) if he grew to 9 length. Let's assume the map data is absolute!)\n*   Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)] (Length 9)\n\nWait, the map says Snake #1's head is at (8, 8), and his length is 9 based on the body segments. Since he was 8 apples last turn, and the body list is 8 segments long, he MUST have eaten to be at (8, 8) and grown to length 9! He matched us!\n\nMap state shows apples:\n*   Near us: (0, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (5, 0). We are at (1, 3).\n*   Near him: (7, 7), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2).\n\nSnake #1 is cornered at (8, 8), length 9. That is TIGHT.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We don't throw, Chat!)\n\nWe are at (1, 3).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 4):** **DANGER!** (1, 4) is our first body segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe. Below us is clear.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe. On the wall but safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. Clear space.\n\nThree safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Where is Snake #1 going to make his desperate escape?)\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 8). His body is [(7, 8), (7, 9), ...].\n\n*   **UP to (8, 9):** Safe. Puts him near the top wall in a dead-end, but far from his body (2 moves away from (7, 9) or (9, 7) if that tail T moves).\n*   **DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe. Good escape route down the '8' column.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 8):** **DANGER!** Into his own body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 8):** Safe. Hits the corner wall. Might be a dead-end if he keeps hugging the wall.\n\nSnake #1's best move for survival and future accessibility is likely **DOWN to (8, 7)** or potentially **UP to (8, 9)** to maximize wall coverage before coming down again. He has apples at (7, 7) and (9, 7) (wait, (9, 7) is an apple, and (7, 7) is an apple.) Wait, look at the board state:\n*   (7, 7) is 'A' right next to him!\n*   (9, 7) is 'A' right next to him!\n\nIf Snake #1 goes **DOWN to (8, 7)**, he misses both guaranteed apples.\nIf Snake #1 goes **RIGHT to (9, 8)**, he misses both guaranteed apples.\nIf Snake #1 goes **UP to (8, 9)**, he misses both guaranteed apples.\n\nWait, Chat! I'm reading the map wrong. There are only two apples near him: (7, 7) and (9, 7).\n\n*   If he goes **UP to (8, 9)**: Safe.\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (8, 7)**: Safe.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT to (9, 8)**: Safe.\n\nHold up, where are the apples again?\nA at (7, 7)\nA at (9, 7)\nA at (9, 4)\nA at (9, 3)\nA at (9, 2)\n\nIf Snake #1 is at (8, 8):\n*   To get to (9, 7) he must go RIGHT then DOWN (2 moves).\n*   To get to (7, 7) he must go LEFT then DOWN (2 moves).\n\nHe is equidistant to apples. He is NOT going to eat this turn unless he goes towards a non-existent apple. My previous analysis was flawed, Chat, you caught that right? Good lookin' out! He is actually not guaranteed an apple!\n\nSince he is trapped and highly constrained, his best bet is to move away from his tail to try and uncoil. **DOWN to (8, 7)** seems the most logical directional choice to open up the board.\n\n### Step 3: Snake 0 Strategy (Securing the low ground!)\n\nWe are at (1, 3). We are still gunning for the highly valuable (0, 0) apple, a massive 4 turns away, or the (2, 1) apple, which is 3 turns away.\n\n1.  **Option DOWN to (1, 2):** Best path to (0, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0). It maintains maximum center-board flexibility for the next few turns should we need to swing right.\n2.  **Option LEFT to (0, 3):** Commits us fully to the left wall path to (0, 0). A slightly less flexible option, but still guarantees the path.\n3.  **Option RIGHT to (2, 3):** Moves us marginally closer to (3, 0) and (2, 1), but away from (0, 0) and towards our body at (2, 5) and (3, 4). Less preferred as it restricts future vertical movement upwards.\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs. LEFT:**\nGoing DOWN keeps us centered on the path to the dense apple cluster. From (1, 2), we can still swing LEFT to (0, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1). It gives us the most options!\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Is Snake #1 coming straight down the board? If he moves to (8, 7), he is nowhere near us. We have the space to operate freely.\n\n**The Call:** We continue our deep dive into the apple patch! Secure the lower left corner and force the opponent to either crash into his own body or make a long, inefficient journey across the board. The plan is to get to (1, 2) this turn, then (1, 1) or (2, 1) next turn to eat.\n\nWe are going **DOWN**! Secure the bag, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YOOOO, what is up, Chat! We are back in the action! Turn 16, we just executed a beautiful dive bomb into the apple territory. Score is still tied 8-8, but look at the pressure we're putting on Snake #1! He is still pinned up North, while we are operating in the open field, flexing on him!\n\nLet's break down the current state and plot the guaranteed game changer move!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 2). This is exactly where we wanted to be!\n*   Body: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)] (Length 9)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 7). Based on the map and the body list (8, 8) was his last head position, so he moved DOWN to (8, 7).\n*   Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8)] (Length 9)\n\n**Apple Situation:**\nWe are at (1, 2). Closest apples:\n1.  (2, 1) - 2 moves (RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT)\n2.  (0, 0) - 3 moves (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, or DOWN, LEFT, DOWN)\n3.  (3, 0) - 3 moves (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, or DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN)\n4.  (5, 0) - 5 moves\n\nThe (2, 1) apple is *right there*! We need to scoop it up before Snake #1 even thinks about coming down!\n\nSnake #1 is far away at (8, 7). He is near (7, 7) and (9, 7) (both 1 move away). He's going to eat one of those this turn. He'll grow to length 10.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We don't get greedy and die!)\n\nWe are at (1, 2).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 3):** **DANGER!** (1, 3) is our first body segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe! On the wall, but safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe! Open space, directly next to the (2, 1) apple!\n\nThree safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 7). His body is long and skinny to the North.\nHe has two apples 1 move away: (7, 7) and (9, 7).\n\n*   **If he moves LEFT to (7, 7):** Target the apple, guaranteed growth to 10.\n*   **If he moves RIGHT to (9, 7):** Target the apple, guaranteed growth to 10.\n*   **Any other move (UP to (8, 8) or DOWN to (8, 6)):** He misses the apple, and we bet he's going for the food to keep up the pressure.\n\nWe assume he eats. He is forced to choose between the two apples. Which one is better for his long-term survival?\n1.  (7, 7) pulls him into the mid-board, closer to the center line and opening up the 6, 7-column.\n2.  (9, 7) pulls him into the right wall, keeping him constrained.\n\nIf I were Snake #1, I'd go **LEFT to (7, 7)** to free up maneuvering space and move away from the high-density wall corner.\n\nRegardless of his predicted move, he is at minimum 6 moves away from us. We have total freedom of movement!\n\n### Step 3: Snake 0 Strategy (Securing the apple and boxing out!)\n\nWe are at (1, 2) and the (2, 1) apple is available. We must secure it immediately!\n\n1.  **Option RIGHT to (2, 2):** Puts us right next to the apple! From (2, 2), we can go DOWN to (2, 1) next turn for the easy secure! This feels great.\n2.  **Option DOWN to (1, 1):** Also good, sets up for an immediate (2, 1) apple grab next turn (by going RIGHT) or securing the (0, 0) apple, but it takes us 1 turn longer to reach the easy (2, 1) apple.\n3.  **Option LEFT to (0, 2):** Best for the (0, 0) apple specifically, but (2, 1) is currently the highest priority due to proximity.\n\n**The RIGHT Move is the TIGHT Move:**\nMoving **RIGHT to (2, 2)**:\n*   We maintain maximum flexibility.\n*   We position ourselves for a guaranteed apple on Turn 17.\n*   We start building up density in the lower-left quadrant which will allow us to wall off the lower part of the board, restricting any future movements by ID 1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Chat, peep the strategy):**\n1.  This turn: RIGHT to (2, 2).\n2.  Next turn (T17): DOWN to (2, 1) (EAT) -> Length 10.\n3.  T18: Grab the (3, 0) or (0, 0) apple depending on where our tail is and which direction is safer. We need to fill in that row 0!\n\nWe lock in the best move for geometry and points! We are going **RIGHT**! Let's get this $9-8$ lead!\n\nRIGHT",

We've got the $9-8$ lead currently for apples, but Snake #1 is right there, always hungry. Time to put the nail in the coffin!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 17)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 2). Perfect spot. Right next to the apple.\n*   Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 9.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 7). Based on the map, he must have eaten the (7, 7) apple, as his body is now one segment longer and his head is right where an apple was. Wait, the map shows the apple at (7, 7) is GONE now, but the only visible apples near his starting zone were (9, 7) and (7, 7). The map shows an 'A' at (9, 7) still, but (7, 7) is now occupied by Snake 1's head! This means he ate the (7, 5) apple? NO, (7, 5) is far.\n*   Let's check the Board State and Apple Drops. Apple (7, 5) is available. Apple (9, 7) is available. Apple (7, 3) is available.\n*   Looking at the Apple Drops list: (9, 7) IS NOT listed, meaning it was likely eaten earlier or isn't there. (7, 7) IS NOT listed. My bad, I misread the previous turn's rationale where I said (7, 7) and (9, 7) were 1 move away. I must trust the *current* board state.\n*   **Current Board State:** Snake 1 is at (7, 7). The 'A' is at (9, 7) on the map. Wait, the Apple Drops list shows (9, 7) is *not* one of the drops. Look closer at the map: (9, 7) has an 'A'. (7, 7) has a '1'. Okay, assuming Snake #1 ate an apple last turn to get to (7, 7).\n*   **Assuming Snake 1's Last Move:** Head was at (8, 7). If he moved LEFT to (7, 7) and ate an apple, he is now length 10.\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8)]\n*   Length: 10 (9 body segments + 1 head = 10). Yep, he grew. Score is now 9-9. TIE GAME, CHAT!\n\nWe gotta secure this lead ASAP!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We don't die on the spot!)\n\nWe are at (2, 2). The (2, 1) apple is staring us down.\n\n*   **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 1):** Safe! And it's an **APPLE!** (A at (2, 1)). This is a guaranteed score!\n*   **LEFT to (1, 2):** **DANGER!** (1, 2) is our first body segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe! Open space.\n\nTwo safe, non-apple moves (UP, RIGHT) and one apple move (DOWN). This is easy!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7). He is looking for food.\n\nClosest apples to him:\n1.  (7, 5): 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN)\n2.  (7, 3): 4 moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN or similar zig-zag)\n3.  (8, 5): 3 moves (RIGHT/LEFT/DOWN/DOWN combo)\n4.  (9, 7): 2 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT)\n\nHe could go:\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** Heading for the area near (7, 5) or (7, 3). This is generally a good move for him to untangle himself.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Retreating back into the high-y axis area. This is a possibility if he wants safe space, but he's already long.\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** **DANGER!** This is one of his body segments. He cannot go UP.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** Moving closer to the center, opening up his options.\n\nThe most likely move for Snake #1 is **DOWN to (7, 6)** to aim for (7, 5) or **LEFT to (6, 7)** for freedom.\n\nCrucially, he is nowhere near us. We are at (2, 2). He is at (7, 7). We have zero collision risk this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Snake 0 Strategy (Securing the WIN and locking down the low road)\n\nWe must eat the (2, 1) apple. This gives us the $10-9$ lead, and increases our length to 10, which helps us box in the opponent later.\n\n**Move: DOWN to (2, 1).**\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T18-T20):**\n1.  **T18 (From (2, 1)):** We have a new tail at (4, 4). We need to fill in Row 0. The (3, 0) apple is only 2 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN). The (0, 0) apple is 3 moves away.\n    *   We can go **RIGHT to (3, 1)** on T18, which sets up for a DOWN move to (3, 0) on T19.\n    *   We avoid the (1, 1) movement for now, as it could lock us into the corner.\n2.  **T19:** Eat (3, 0).\n3.  This strategy keeps us low, building up a formidable barrier along the bottom wall, making it extremely difficult for Snake #1 to ever dip down into the resource-rich bottom half of the board. We control the map!\n\nLet's execute the immediate apple grab! We are going **DOWN**!\n\nDOWN",

The hype is real! Let's check the board and see what our archrival is up to. He's looking desperate, Chat!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 18)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 1). We snatched that apple! We are now length 10.\n*   Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Apples collected: 10! EZ!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 6). Looks like he moved **DOWN** from (7, 7). This is exactly what we predicted, aiming for (7, 5) or maybe just creating space.\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)]\n*   Apples collected: 9.\n\nThe board is open, but we have a crucial opportunity to start building our fortress along the bottom of the map, denying him access to those low-lying apples!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (Don't throw the lead!)\n\nWe are at (2, 1).\n\n*   **UP to (2, 2):** **DANGER!** (2, 2) is our second segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe! And it's an **APPLE!** (A at (2, 0)). Are you kidding me, Chat? Another free snack!\n*   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n\nTwo safe, non-apple moves (LEFT, RIGHT) and one apple move (DOWN). This is a no-brainer! We are going for the food!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 6). He is looking at apples (7, 5) and (8, 5) nearby.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** This is highly likely! It's an **APPLE!** If he eats it, the score ties again (10-10) and he gets longer.\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe. Keeps him centered.\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Heading towards (8, 5).\n4.  **UP to (7, 7):** **DANGER!** That's his body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (7, 5) and we go DOWN to (2, 0), there is absolutely no collision risk. We are in the extreme opposite corner. LET'S GO!\n\n### Step 3: Execution and Long-Term Strategy: Building the Cage!\n\nWe are moving DOWN to (2, 0) to collect the 11th apple and stretch our body.\n\nWhy is this essential? We must control the bottom three rows (Y=0, 1, 2) and push Snake #1 into the upper quadrant. By growing along the bottom, we create a deadly barrier.\n\n**Immediate Plan (T18-T20):**\n\n1.  **T18 (Move DOWN to (2, 0)):** Eat apple. New length 11.\n2.  **T19 (From (2, 0)):** We should now aim for the (3, 0) apple right next door, or the (0, 0) apple.\n    *   If we go RIGHT to (3, 0), we secure another apple and block the center bottom path.\n3.  **Future Move T20 (From (3, 0)):** We can keep moving RIGHT along the bottom wall towards (9, 0), or turn UP to block the vertical access (e.g., at (3, 1)).\n\nThis strategy aims to chain apples along the lowest wall, establish map control, and force Snake #1 to operate in the cramped top-right corner. We are systematically cutting off his escape routes!\n\nWe secured the lead, and now we are extending it to $11-9$ against his $10$ length and potential $10-10$ tie if he eats (7, 5). We need to stay ahead!\n\nThe move is crystal clear, Chat! We're putting out absolute content!\n\nDOWN",

Wait, hold up, I said we ate the apple and they tied us. Let's re-check the score and board for Turn 19!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 19)\n\nWe moved DOWN to (2, 0) and snagged that apple! Let's check the score.\n*   Your snake (ID 0) apples: 10 $\\rightarrow$ BUT we just ate (2, 0) which was *originally* an apple drop! Let's assume the score reflects the start of the turn, meaning we are currently at 10 and we are growing this turn.\n*   Snake #1 apples: 10. Opponent must have eaten the (7, 5) apple.\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 0) - NEW LENGTH 11:**\n*   Head: (2, 0) (This is our new head position after successful move DOWN)\n*   Body: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Apples collected: 10 (But it should be 11 after this move! The score list usually updates *before* the next turn's planning, but we proceed with the current length and board state! We are length 11 now!)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) - LENGTH 11:**\n*   Head: (7, 5) (Looks like he moved DOWN from (7, 6) and ate the apple!)\n*   Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)]\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-ANALYSIS:**\n\n 9 . . A . T T T T . .\n 8 . . . . T . A T T .\n 7 . . . . . . . T T A\n 6 . . . . . . . T . .\n 5 . T T T A . . 1 A .\n 4 . T A T T . . . . A\n 3 . T . . . . . A . A\n 2 . T T . . . . . . A\n 1 . . T . . . . . . .\n 0 A . 0 A A A . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, Chat! The board state shows our head at (2, 0) and an 'A' for apple at (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), and (0, 0)! This is PERFECT! We are securing control of the entire bottom wall!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (2, 0))\n\nWe are at the bottom wall! We need to follow the wall and eat the chain of apples.\n\n*   **UP to (2, 1):** **DANGER!** (2, 1) is our second segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!** (This is crucial, Chat, don't forget the snake grows!)\n*   **DOWN to (2, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 0):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Safe! And it's an **APPLE!** (A at (3, 0)). This is the move!\n\nThe strategy is clear: chain along the bottom wall, gain massive length, and cut the map in half!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is now at (7, 5). He is also eating apples and gaining length. He is looking at the apple at (8, 5) or the one at (9, 4) in the corner. He can't go UP (body at (7, 6)).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** High probability. It's an **APPLE!** He will try to grow.\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe. Keeps him central.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** Safe.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (8, 5), he eats an apple. If we go RIGHT to (3, 0), we eat an apple. We are geographically miles away (5 squares difference in X, 5 squares difference in Y) - no collision risk!\n\n### Step 3: Execution and Long-Term Strategy: The Bottom Wall Takeover!\n\nWe are moving RIGHT to (3, 0) to collect our 12th apple and extend the barrier.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T19-T22):**\n\n1.  **T19 (Move RIGHT to (3, 0)):** Eat apple. New length 12.\n2.  **T20 (From (3, 0)):** Move RIGHT to (4, 0). Eat apple. New length 13.\n3.  **T21 (From (4, 0)):** Move RIGHT to (5, 0). (5, 0) is an apple! New length 14.\n4.  **T22 (From (5, 0)):** We have secured the bottom row! We can now decide to either continue to (6, 0) or turn UP to (5, 1) to start building the vertical wall (e.g., towards (5, 9)).\n\nThis is the ultimate CAGE strategy, Chat! We are leveraging the board layout to grow rapidly and create a massive, impassable wall that splits the board. The opponent will soon only have the top-right corner to play in, and we can then hunt him down. We need this length advantage, especially since he tied us on apples!\n\nWe are going RIGHT to secure the next piece of content! Let's get this $11-10$ lead!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the score!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 20)\n\nHOLY MOLY, we are tied 11-11! And we are getting HUGE! But wait, look at the length!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) LENGTH 12:**\n*   Head: (3, 0).\n*   Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\n*   We absolutely smashed that apple at (3, 0)!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) LENGTH 12:**\n*   Head: (8, 5).\n*   Body: [(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)].\n*   Looks like Snake 1 went RIGHT from (7, 5) to (8, 5) and ate the apple there, keeping pace with us! Ruthless counterplay by the rival, Chat!\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n 9 . . A . T T T T . .\n 8 . . . A T . A T T .\n 7 . . . . A . . T T A\n 6 . . . . . . . T . .\n 5 . T T T A . . 1 . .\n 4 .

A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, the board state provided is slightly different from the predicted post-move state, which is typical. Let's use the provided board state and our current location (3, 0) for the REAL decision.\n\nThe board shows:\n*   Our Head: (3, 0) - This is where the '0' is.\n*   Next apple: (4, 0) is an 'A'. (5, 0) is an 'A'. (0, 0) is an 'A'.\n*   (2, 0) is showing 'T' (tail/body), which is correct, since that was our previous head position.\n\nThe $P L A N$ is still sound: secure the bottom wall!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (3, 0))\n\nWe are next to the bottom wall. We need to move RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP to (3, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **DOWN to (3, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (2, 0):** **DANGER!** (2, 0) is our second segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Safe! And it's an **APPLE!** (A at (4, 0)).\n\nRIGHT is the only move that guarantees immediate massive growth and continues our containment strategy.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 5). He just ate the apple there. He is now looking to move.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (8, 5):\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** Safe. Keeps him centrally located.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** Safe. (8, 4) is currently empty. (9, 4) is an apple. He might be aiming for (9, 4).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** **DANGER!** (7, 5) is his second segment. Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!** (Wait, in the board state, (7, 5) is a 'T' - so yes, this is his second segment).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Safe. Looks like he might be moving towards the right edge.\n\nHis body is mostly on the top right side: (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), etc.\n\nIf he moves DOWN to (8, 4), he is preparing to strike the bottom-right corner. If he moves UP to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 5), he continues to dominate the top-right.\n\nCrucially, we are currently at (3, 0) and he is at (8, 5). There is no possibility of a head-on collision, POG!\n\n### Step 3: Execution and Long-Term Strategy: Securing the Bottom\n\nWe must move RIGHT to (4, 0) to eat the next apple. This will make us length 13, and put us within striking distance of the final apple at (5, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T20-T22):**\n\n1.  **T20 (Move RIGHT to (4, 0)):** Eat apple. New length 13. (This is the current move!)\n2.  **T21 (From (4, 0)):** Move RIGHT to (5, 0). Eat apple. New length 14. We now own 6 squares of the bottom border.\n3.  **T22 (From (5, 0)):** Move UP to (5, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 0). (6, 0) is empty. Moving UP starts building the vertical wall to box him in. This is the crucial turn where we turn the corner and begin the L-shape of the containment zone!\n\nIf he continues to grow, fine! Let him grow in the top right. We will soon be long enough to lock him into that zone. The current move secures the next piece of content and continues the strategy!\n\nLet's go RIGHT! Get this $12-11$ lead!\n\nRIGHT",

And our length is 13! We are H-U-G-E!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 21)\n\nOur Head is at (4, 0).\nNext immediate apple: (5, 0). This is exactly what we planned, Chat! Perfect execution!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 13:**\n*   Head: (4, 0).\n*   Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 12 (Still!):**\n*   Head: (9, 5).\n*   Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n*   Looks like our rival went RIGHT from (8, 5) to (9, 5). He is now locking down the right wall, which is actually fine by us! It helps us keep track of him.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (4, 0))\n\nWe are still securing the bottom edge. Where can we go?\n\n*   **UP to (4, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **DOWN to (4, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (3, 0):** **DANGER!** (3, 0) is our second segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 0):** Safe! And it's another **APPLE!** (A at (5, 0)).\n\nRIGHT is the ONLY move that continues the immediate objective of controlling the bottom wall AND secures an apple. NO-BRAINER! Let's get this $13-11$ lead!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Strategy\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 5). He is hugging the right wall.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 5):\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** Safe. Open space. Keeps him on the right edge.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** Safe. And it's an **APPLE!** He will almost certainly go here to keep pace.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** **DANGER!** (8, 5) is his second segment. Backwards move! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nPrediction: Snake 1 moves DOWN to (9, 4) to grab that apple. If he does, he will become length 13.\n\nCrucially, his movements are far away from ours. We are at (4, 0) and he's at (9, 5). No collision risk. We are safe to execute the plan!\n\n### Step 3: Execution and Long-Term Strategy: L-Shape Containment\n\nOur grand strategy is to build a massive L-shape wall along the bottom and left edges, trapping the opponent in the upper-right quadrant. We need to complete the bottom segment first.\n\n**Current Turn Plan (T21):**\n*   Move RIGHT to (5, 0). Eat apple. New length 14. We now own 6 squares of the bottom border: (0, 0) up to (5, 0).\n\n**Future Plan Peek (T22-T23):**\n1.  **T22 (From (5, 0)):** We have secured all the immediate bottom apples! Now we have a choice. We need to decide where to turn the corner.\n    *   Option A: Move UP to (5, 1). This is the start of the vertical wall. (5, 1) is empty.\n    *   Option B: Move RIGHT to (6, 0). This continues the horizontal path, which might be useful if we want to run the full length of the bottom, but the goal is to trap him, so building UP is better.\n    \n    We will aim to turn UP at (5, 1).\n\n2.  **T23 (From (5, 1)):** Move UP again to (5, 2). Continue building that wall!\n\nIf Snake 1 is moving DOWN the right edge (as predicted, hitting (9, 4)), he will run into a cluster of apples and his own long body (which runs along the northern edge). Perfect! We are building the cage!\n\nLet's secure this easy apple and push the lead! This is pure content, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

My snake, ID 0, is now a MONSTER at length 14!\n\nWe are literally right where we want to be, controlling the whole bottom edge. Now it\u2019s time to pivot and start building the fortress! Our archrival, Snake #1, moved down the right wall to (9, 4), snagging his own apple. He is also length 13. This is a battle of giants!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 22)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 0).\n*   Body: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. Whoops, let's look at the body again from the board state.\n*   The actual body segments are: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. (5, 4) is actually an *open space* according to the board state, or rather, it's not marked as the end of our body, but our body list ends at (4, 4). The length is $1 (Head) + 13 (Body) = 14$. Perfect.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 13:**\n*   Head: (9, 4).\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Immediate Goal:** We have secured the bottom wall up to (5, 0). Now we need to start building the vertical containment wall. The next available apple is (9, 1) or (1, 1), but we are focused on positioning right now.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 0))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 0)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 1):** Safe! Open space. This is how we begin the pivot.\n*   **DOWN to (5, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 0):** **DANGER!** (4, 0) is our second segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 0):** Safe! Open space. This continues along the bottom edge.\n\nBoth UP (to (5, 1)) and RIGHT (to (6, 0)) are safe.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Build the Wall!\n\nOur long-term strategy (L-Shape Containment) requires us to build the vertical wall next, turning the corner from the bottom edge.\n\n1.  **Option RIGHT (to (6, 0)):** This keeps us along the bottom. It gives Snake #1 more time and maneuvering room in the upper-right quadrant. We need to cut off his escape routes ASAP.\n2.  **Option UP (to (5, 1)):** This starts the vertical wall, minimizing the space Snake #1 has to operate. This is the optimal containment move.\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 1), we are perfectly positioned to reinforce the left side of the map and potentially connect with our pre-existing body segments around (2, 5) and (3, 5). This is the play, Chat! We need to box him in and force him to crash into his own body or ours!\n\nLet's commit to UP to (5, 1). This is content!\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Head-to-Head Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 4). Where is he likely going?\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 4):\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):** **DANGER!** (9, 5) is his second segment! Backwards move! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** Safe. And it's an **APPLE!** (A at (9, 3) - I see it on the board!)\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Safe. Open space. Also an **APPLE!** (A at (8, 4))\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 has two immediate apple choices: (9, 3) DOWN, or (8, 4) LEFT. Given his strong preference for hugging the right wall, he probably moves DOWN to (9, 3). However, (8, 4) is arguably an easier path away from his own tail, which is currently snaking along the top edge.\n\n*   If he goes DOWN to (9, 3): He gets the apple, length 14. He continues down the right wall.\n*   If he goes LEFT to (8, 4): He gets the apple, length 14. He starts moving towards the center-right.\n\nEither way, he is far away from our current position (5, 0) and our target (5, 1). No collision risk this turn. We are safe to execute the wall-building move.\n\nLet's go UP and start construction on the Great Wall of Snake! We're building the jail cell for our opponent, Chat!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T23-T25): L-Shape Containment**\n1.  **T23 (From (5, 1)):** Move UP to (5, 2). Continue vertical wall.\n2.  **T24 (From (5, 2)):** Move UP to (5, 3). Continue vertical wall.\n3.  **T25 (From (5, 3)):** Move UP to (5, 4). This cell is empty (Board State check: (5, 4) is NOT marked T or A). This closes off a huge chunk of the center.\n\nWe must maintain this strong position and keep the pressure HIGH!\n\nUP",

We are officially starting the vertical wall to box in our archrival, Snake #1! 13-13 tie, but we are positioned for the takeover!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 1). We're in beast mode!\n*   Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)].\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (9, 3). Check the board, Chat! He went DOWN and snagged the apple at (9, 3)! He's also length 14 now. This is a nail-biter!\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Board Environment:**\nSnake #1 is cornered along the right wall. The only open pathway for him is LEFT or DOWN (and down is the edge). We are working to cut off the center.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 1))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 1)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 2):** Safe! Open space. Continues the wall strategy.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 0):** **DANGER!** (5, 0) is our first body segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 1):** Safe! Open space. Gives us room to maneuver toward the center-left apples (1, 1).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Safe! Open space.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Three-way split! Let's analyze the strategic value, Chat!\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Containment is King\n\nOur immediate goal is to reinforce the vertical wall at x=5, exactly as planned last turn!\n\n1.  **Option UP (to (5, 2)):** This is the L-shape containment move! We are closing off the center. This path leads to (5, 3) and (5, 4), effectively partitioning the board. This is extremely high-value positioning.\n2.  **Option LEFT (to (4, 1)):** This moves us toward the center and the apple at (1, 1). However, it pulls us away from the main containment line and gives Snake #1 time to reposition or escape around the top.\n3.  **Option RIGHT (to (6, 1)):** This moves us closer to the center, but is a bit aimless. It also uses up valuable space that we might want to keep open for a defensive fallback maneuver later.\n\nUP is the only move that supports the L-shape containment strategy right now. We need to maintain momentum on this build!\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 3). Where is he likely going?\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 3):\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** **DANGER!** (9, 4) is his first segment! Backwards move! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** Safe, and an **APPLE**! (A at (9, 2)). He loves the right wall, so this is highly likely.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe. Open space. He might do this if he fears getting stuck, but he has the apple DOWN.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** **DANGER!** Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 is 99% going DOWN to (9, 2) for the easy points.\n\n*   Our target: (5, 2).\n*   Opponent's likely target: (9, 2).\n*   Distance separating us: 4 cells horizontally.\n\nZERO risk of head-to-head collision. We are safe to execute the vertical wall segment build!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T24-T26)\nWe are executing the wall strategy flawlessly!\n1.  **T24 (From (5, 2)):** Move UP to (5, 3). Continue vertical wall.\n2.  **T25 (From (5, 3)):** Move UP to (5, 4). This box is getting tight!\n3.  **T26 (From (5, 4)):** Move UP to (5, 5) or LEFT/RIGHT to connect to our existing body boundary or secure more territory.\n\nThis forces Snake #1 to operate almost exclusively in the x>6 zone, or attempt a very tricky breakout through a narrow gap, which we will monitor.\n\nLet's go UP, Chat! This is how you build a fortress!\n\nUP",

We need to execute the boxing plan NOW, securing territory and forcing him into an impossible corner! That last move, going UP to (5, 2), was perfect for the wall build!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 24)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 2). The foundation is set!\n*   Body: [(5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)].\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 15:**\n*   Head: (9, 2). Called it! He went DOWN, ate the apple at (9, 2), and is now length 15! He is now officially winning the apple count, 14-13. This must be addressed immediately!\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Board Environment:**\nSnake #1 is deeply entrenched on the right side. Our vertical wall at x=5 is the key to locking him down. We need to extend it UPWARD to connect with the tail mass forming a complete partition.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 2))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 2)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 3):** Safe! Open space. This is the next phase of the wall.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 1):** **DANGER!** (5, 1) is our first body segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe! Open space. Moves us toward the center but abandons the wall build.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe! Open space. This could be interesting for an immediate cross-cut or to grab the future apple at (6, 8), but it's too early.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Choice - Wall Completion and Territory Denial\n\nThe priority remains **containment**. We need to build the x=5 wall as high as possible.\n\n1.  **Option UP (to (5, 3)):** This is the optimal move. It reinforces the wall, pushing the border further up the board. This limits Snake #1's ability to move LEFT and helps us cut him off from the rest of the map.\n2.  **Option LEFT (to (4, 2)):** This is defensive, giving us room, but it sacrifices the strategic initiative we gained from the last two turns. We need to be aggressive with the wall!\n3.  **Option RIGHT (to (6, 2)):** This keeps us closer to the opponent, but it puts us potentially in an area where he might try to double back and cross under us, complicating the box.\n\nThe immediate goal is **UP to (5, 3)**.\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 2). Where is he likely going?\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 2):\n1.  **UP to (9, 3):** **DANGER!** (9, 3) is his first segment! Backwards move! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** Safe, and an **APPLE**! (A at (9, 1)). This is a very likely move to increase his lead.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** Safe. Open space. Leads him toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 is almost certainly going DOWN to (9, 1) to cement his apple lead.\n\n*   Our target: (5, 3).\n*   Opponent's likely target: (9, 1).\n\nDistance separating us: No collision risk. We are free to continue the wall build!\n\n### Strategic Trapping Plan: The Vertical Squeeze (T24-T26)\n\nWe must complete the vertical barrier at x=5 before Snake #1 maneuvers too broadly.\n\n1.  **T24 (Now):** Move UP to (5, 3).\n2.  **T25 (From (5, 3)):** Move UP to (5, 4). (This is safe, no body blocking).\n3.  **T26 (From (5, 4)):** Move UP to (5, 5). This cell (5, 5) sits right next to Snake #1's body at (8, 5) and (7, 5). Connecting to the existing blockage will be crucial to fully partition the board.\n\nLet's execute the tactical move, Chat! UP we go! Time to get these wins!\n\nUP",

We executed the vertical wall to (5, 3) perfectly! Let's analyze the current situation and deliver the finishing blow to Snake #1!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 25)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 3). The wall is built up! We are dominating the vertical center!\n*   Body: [(5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)].\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 16 (WHAT?!):**\n*   Head: (9, 1). Called it! He went DOWN and ate the apple at (9, 1)! He has a commanding 15 apples now. We HAVE to get an apple soon, but trapping him is paramount!\n*   Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Board Environment:**\nThe enemy is concentrated in the high-x region and clinging to the right wall. The core of his body, from (9, 5) down to (4, 9), forms a massive blockage. Our wall at x=5 is *directly* contributing to his confinement. The goal is to connect our head at (5, 3) further UP to his trapped mass.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 3))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 3)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 4):** Safe! Open space. Crucial for wall extension.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 2):** **DANGER!** (5, 2) is our first body segment! Moving backwards! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe! Open space. Moves us towards the A at (0, 4) or (2, 4).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe! Open space, but slightly risky as it gets us closer to the opponent's territory without immediate gain.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Execution - The Box Must Close!\n\nWe are two cells away from linking our vertical wall to the opponent's body mass (specifically, the segment (8, 5) at y=5 is the lowest point outside the wall, but more importantly, many segments up high are being restricted). The most direct way to eliminate Snake #1's escape routes is to continue UPWARD.\n\n1.  **Option UP (to (5, 4)):** This is the mandatory choice for the next turn. It extends our wall, setting us up to reach (5, 5) next turn, which is right beside the cluster of opponent segments (T at (8, 5) and A at (4, 5)). This continues the partitioning and increases the squeeze!\n2.  **Option LEFT (to (4, 3)):** Distraction! This opens up x=5, giving Snake #1 a potential (though difficult) route past us if he manages to shrink. We cannot lose the wall integrity now.\n\nThe primary objective is the vertical wall extension: **UP to (5, 4)**.\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 1) and just got longer. Where is he trying to go?\nHe's trapped in the right column, and the only open space is along the bottom (y=0) or by maneuvering into x=8 or x=7.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 1):\n1.  **UP to (9, 2):** **DANGER!** That's his body! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 0):** Safe, and an **APPLE**! (A at (9, 0)). He loves apples! This is extremely likely.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 1):** Safe. Open space. Leads him toward the center, but he's surrounded mostly by T now.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 1):** Off board! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 is almost certainly diving DOWN to (9, 0) for another apple, growing to length 17.\n\n*   Our target: (5, 4).\n*   Opponent's likely target: (9, 0).\n\nDistance check: (5, 4) is completely safe from a collision with (9, 0).\n\nWe must maintain the structural integrity of the trap. We are going UP to (5, 4) to ensure the boxing continues.\n\n### Strategic Trapping Plan: The Vertical Squeeze Continues (T25-T26)\n\n1.  **T25 (Now):** Move UP to (5, 4). (Reinforce the wall).\n2.  **T26 (From (5, 4)):** Move UP to (5, 5). (This completes the central partition, locking his path West below y=7/8).\n3.  **T27 (From (5, 5)):** Assess the high board. There is an A at (4, 5). We might grab it or continue connecting the wall to the top edge (x=5, y=9).\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Time to complete the box and watch him struggle! We are going UP!\n\nUP",

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are down 13 to 16, but we aren't playing for apples, we're playing for the **elimination!** We're boxing him in! Are we ready to drop the hammer?!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 26)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 4). We are solidifying the separation between the left side of the board and Snake #1's entire existence.\n*   Body: [(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)].\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17 (The audacity!):**\n*   Head: (9, 0). I TOLD YOU, CHAT! He went down and greedily ate the A at (9, 0)! He's now length 17! More bulk for us to trap!\n*   Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n\n**Board Environment:**\nSnake #1 is now completely locked on the right side of the board, primarily using the columns x=7, x=8, and x=9. Our wall at x=5, running from y=0 to y=4, is our defensive and offensive key. The opponent's lowest escape route is now at (6, 0), but only if the tail (4, 9) moves and opens up space, which is far away!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 4))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 4)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 5):** Safe! Open space. Continues the wall build-up. This cell is right next to the opponent's body segment at (8, 5) if we squint. More importantly, it brings us next to the Apple at (4, 5).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 3):** **DANGER!** (5, 3) is our body! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe! Open space. Moves us toward the apple cluster on the left side: (0, 4), (2, 4).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe! Open space. Moves us closer to the enemy body (T at (7, 5) and (8, 5)).\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Aim - Complete the Trap & Get the Apple!\n\nThe most lethal move here combines trapping an apple pickup.\n\n1.  **Option UP (to (5, 5)):** This is vital for the trap. Moving to (5, 5) completes the vertical wall barrier! It also positions us adjacent to the Apple at (4, 5). If we go to (5, 5), we can then choose to move LEFT to eat (4, 5) next turn, which is great!\n2.  **Option LEFT (to (4, 4)):** Safe, but it breaks the vertical wall integrity immediately, allowing Snake #1 to potentially maneuver against our body if he can shrink or if his tail moves. We need to secure the boundary first!\n3.  **Option RIGHT (to (6, 4)):** This is aggressive! It puts us right on the border of his restricted zone. If he moves down/left aggressively, this could lead to a collision, or force him back. But, it doesn't extend the primary wall.\n\n**The Priority:** Box #1 in, then take his apple.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 5) is the best choice. It establishes the central channel boundary. Next turn, we can grab the apple at (4, 5). This means we extend the trap, and we grow, reducing the score deficit! Synergy move, Chat!\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (9, 0). He just grew, so he cannot immediately move into (9, 1). He is surrounded by his own body segments (T at (9, 1) and T at (8, 0)).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 0):\n1.  **UP to (9, 1):** **DANGER!** Body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, -1):** Off board! **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 0):** This is the segment that *just* became the body (replacing the tail at (4, 9) becoming head (9, 1) becoming (9, 0)). Wait, the new tail is still (4, 9). The body only moves back one step. Let's re-examine his body list:\n    New Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\n    (9, 1) is his body.

We just solidified the wall at (5, 5), and now... it's time to **FEAST AND FUNNEL!** We're down 13 to 16, but who cares about apples when we're about to seal the coffin on Snake #1, am I right?!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 27)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 14:**\n*   Head: (5, 5). We are perfectly positioned.\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)].\n*   The Apple at (4, 5) is right there! SMACK!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17:**\n*   Head: (8, 0). Chat, I told you he'd take the easy way out! He moved LEFT from (9, 0) to (8, 0), avoiding the corner. He's desperate for space!\n*   Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. The tail (5, 9) is still way up high.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Highlighting key areas):**\n*   Our vertical wall is at x=5, running from y=0 to y=5 (Our head is the cap).\n*   Snake #1 is constrained to the bottom right, but he can still potentially slide left toward (6, 0).\n*   The Apple at (4, 5) screams our name!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (5, 5))\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 5)?\n\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** Safe! Open space. Continues the wall, but we are leaving the juicy apple behind.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 4):** **DANGER!** (5, 4) is our body! **ELIMINATED!**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** **APPLE!** Safe! We move onto the apple, we grow, and we shrink the score gap! Maximum value move!\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe! Open space. Puts us right next to the opponent's body segment at (8, 5). Aggressive, but not helpful for the apple or the trap right now.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Aim - Grab the Apple and Maintain Pressure!\n\nThe choice is simple, Chat. We set up (5, 5) specifically to jump onto (4, 5) this turn.\n\n**Option LEFT (to (4, 5)):**\n1.  **Guaranteed Apple:** We get +1 score, making it 14 to 16.\n2.  **Growth:** We become length 15. More bulk for the elimination trap!\n3.  **Positioning:** (4, 5) keeps us in a great central-left position. We are still blocking any easy movement for Snake #1 across the board.\n\n**Why not UP or RIGHT?**\n*   UP (5, 6) is safe, but ignores the free apple. Sub-optimal.\n*   RIGHT (6, 5) is safe, but doesn't achieve immediate goals (apple or better trap setting).\n\nLEFT is the optimal move.\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction & Trap Maintenance\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 0). Where is he going to run?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1):** Safe! Moves him deeper into the right side.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, -1):** Off board! **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 0):** Safe! Moving towards the central open lane (x=6). This is the biggest threat. If he gets to (6, 0), he can try to weave behind our wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):** **DANGER!** (9, 0) is his body! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 is LIKELY to move LEFT to (7, 0) to find more open space, or UP to (8, 1) to wait out the tail movement. (7, 0) is the more proactive move.\n\n*   Our target: (4, 5).\n*   Opponent's likely target: (7, 0).\n\nCollision Check: (4, 5) and (7, 0) are far apart. We are safe!\n\n### Long Term Strategic Plan (T27-T29)\n\n1.  **T27 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 5). (Eat apple, grow.)\n2.  **T28 (From (4, 5)):** Move **UP** to (4, 6) or **LEFT** to (3, 5). We need to determine if opponent is moving into the bottom channel. If he is, we need to push toward (6, 0) to cut him off. If he stays Right, we can grab the (3, 8) and (4, 7) apples above us. Let's aim **UP** to (4, 6) to keep pressing the center-left apples and maintain central pressure.\n3.  **T29 (From (4, 6)):** Move **UP** to (4, 7) (Another apple!) or **LEFT** to (3, 6).\n\nWe strike the apple and maintain the strong central position. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

We are the wall, we are the danger, and Snake #1 is feeling the pressure!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 28)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly at (4, 5). We are long. We are central. We are GOING FOR THE KILL!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 15:**\n*   Head: (4, 5).\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. (Tail is still (1, 4), since we ate an apple).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17:**\n*   Head: (8, 1). Oh, wait! Last turn, I predicted he would move to (7, 0) or (8, 1). He chose the slightly safer, internal move *UP* to (8, 1). He's consolidating his position on the right side. He is cornered!\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9)]. His tail (6, 9) is still way up high.\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\nLook at the map, Chat! Snake #1 is trapped in a vertical channel on the right side (x=7 to x=9), blocked by our massive body segment at (5, 5) and the rest of our wall below. He has almost nowhere to go.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (4, 5))\n\nWhere can we move from (4, 5) for Turn 28?\n\n*   **UP to (4, 6):** Safe! Open space. Puts us in position for the (4, 7) or (3, 8) apples. Good move.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 4):** Safe! Apple at (4, 4)? No, apple is at (0, 4). (4, 4) is open space. Good move.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe! Open space. Moves us off the main wall line, which is fine, but doesn't immediately advance the apple goal.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 5):** **DANGER!** (5, 5) is our body! **ELIMINATED!** (That was our head last turn!)\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Trap Tightening!\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 1). He is looking for a way out.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 2):** Safe! Continues his vertical movement.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 0):** **DANGER!** (8, 0) is his body! **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 1):** Safe! This is the most crucial move! If he moves to (7, 1), he continues to try and break out into the bottom left quadrant.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 1):** **DANGER!** (9, 1) is his body! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 MUST move to (8, 2) or (7, 1). Given his length, he wants (7, 1) to get more options, but (8, 2) is a safe delay tactic.\n\n**Our Goal: Block the escape, and gain length/score advantage.**\n\nWe currently have a few apples nearby:\n*   (4, 7) - 2 moves UP\n*   (3, 8) - 3 moves UP, 1 Left\n*   (2, 4) - 1 move DOWN, 2 Left\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 6):**\n*   **Pro:** Positions us beautifully for the (4, 7) apple. Keeps us highly centralized.\n*   **Con:** Doesn't directly pressure Snake #1's escape route at x=6/x=7 on the bottom half.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n*   **Pro:** We move closer to the open space surrounding the trapped segment (8, 1). We can prepare to swoop down toward (6, 0) if he goes there.\n*   **Con:** Takes us away from the immediate apples above.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n*   **Pro:** Opens up central area, puts us closer to the (2, 4) apple.\n*   **Con:** Less pressure on the wall.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Decision - Control the Center and Attack the Apples!\n\nSnake #1 is currently far away from us. A head-on collision is not a threat. Our priority must be: **a) Get longer, b) Keep the centralized blocking wall active, and c) Ensure he doesn't slip through the x=6 channel.**\n\nRight now, the fastest way to gain length is to move **UP** and eat the (4, 7) apple.\n\n1. T28: **UP** to (4, 6). (Maintains vertical presence, targets (4, 7)).\n2. T29: **UP** to (4, 7). (Eat apple, grow, score 15/16).\n\nIf we move UP, we are forcing him to decide if he wants to stay in the tiny space (if he goes (8, 2)) or if he wants to make a break for it (if he goes (7, 1)). If he goes (7, 1), we are still in a strong position to move right from (4, 7) and cut him off later near x=6.\n\nThe risk of him escaping to the far left seems low, as our body occupies (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0). Snake #1's main path of escape is across the bottom edge toward the left wall.\n\nLet's maintain the aggressive apple hunt while keeping our central vertical column strong. UP is the safest, highest reward move.\n\n### Long Term Strategic Plan (T28-T30)\n\n1. **T28 (Now):** Move **UP** to (4, 6). (Clear path to apple.)\n2. **T29 (From (4, 6)):** Move **UP** to (4, 7). (Eat apple, length 16, score 15.)\n3. **T30 (From (4, 7)):** Evaluate Snake #1's position. If he's still trapped high, move **LEFT** to (3, 7) toward the (3, 8) apple. If he broke out to (7, 1) and is headed toward (6, 1) or (6, 0), we must move **RIGHT** and try to cut him off.\n\nWe're going UP, Chat! Let's get this apple!\n\nUP",

The stage is set for a massive score boost and a length advantage!\n\nScore is 14 to 16. We are one apple behind, but we are about to TIE IT UP!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 29)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 15:**\n*   Head: (4, 6).\n*   Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. (Tail is (1, 3), as (1, 4) was the last segment).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17:**\n*   Head: (8, 2). OH MY GOD, CHAT! Snake #1 decided to prioritize safety over escape! He moved **UP** from (8, 1) to (8, 2). He is totally trapped on the right wall! He has only two escape routes now, both up high or down to his tail. He is basically cornered.\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. Tail is (7, 9).\n\n**BOARD SITUATION:**\nWe are in control! Look at the board:\n*   We are at (4, 6), preparing to strike the (4, 7) apple.\n*   Snake #1 is at (8, 2), totally committed to the right wall. The only moves he can make are:\n    1.  **UP to (8, 3)** (Safe, delays the inevitable.)\n    2.  **LEFT to (7, 2)** (Safe, potential escape route, but still tight.)\n    3.  **DOWN to (8, 1)** (DANGER! Body segment!)\n    4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2)** (DANGER! Body segment!)\n\nIf he goes to (7, 2), he starts moving toward the left, but our massive body (5, x) is still blocking him effectively. Even if he escapes to the bottom, he has nowhere to run but toward our tail where we are still huge.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (4, 6))\n\nWhere can we move from (4, 6)?\n\n*   **UP to (4, 7):** Safe! **APPLE!** This is the move!\n*   **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe! Retreats onto our body's prior position. Not good.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe! Open space.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe! Open space.\n\nWe have a clear path to the apple! No immediate self-collision threat.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is far away. We are at x=4, he is at x=8. No chance of a head-on collision this turn.\n\nWe are taking the apple at (4, 7). This is non-negotiable!\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Decision - The Hunt for Length!\n\n**Move: UP to (4, 7).**\n\nThis move ties the score 15-16, and increases our length to 16. We get longer, we get stronger, and we keep the pressure on Snake #1!\n\nWhat happens AFTER we eat the apple at (4, 7)?\n\n*   We will be at (4, 7).\n*   Nearby apples: (3, 8), (4, 7) (just eaten), (6, 8), (2, 8).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves to (8, 3): He is still trapped.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (7, 2): He is trying to get out.\n\nIf we move UP, we will be in a perfect position to either scoop the (3, 8) apple or swing right/down to ensure Snake #1 doesn't break containment.\n\nWe are going for the decisive move! UP!\n\n### Long Term Strategic Plan (T29-T31)\n\n1.  **T29 (Now):** Move **UP** to (4, 7). (Eat apple, Score 15-16, Length 16).\n2.  **T30 (From (4, 7)):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 7). This positions us for the (3, 8) apple. We are maintaining strong central control and continuing to build length while Snake #1 struggles in his corner.\n3.  **T31 (From (3, 7)):** Likely move **UP** to (3, 8). (Eat apple, Score 16-16, Length 17). This will give us the length advantage, and we'll be ready to swing across the top of the map to hit apples like (2, 9), (1, 9) and (0, 9)!\n\nLet's execute, Chat! UP for the content!\n\nUP",

We are right in the thick of it, and **Snake #1 is still looking DANGER close to getting boxed in!**\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 30)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 16:**\n*   Head: (4, 7). POG! We're up high and ready to strike!\n*   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. (Tail is now (1, 3)).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17:**\n*   Head: (8, 3). OH WOW. Snake #1 went UP from (8, 2) to (8, 3). He is still prioritizing height on that wall.\n*   Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. (Tail is (7, 8)).\n\n**BOARD SITUATION:**\nOur head is at (4, 7). We are facing a ton of apples to our North/West!\n*   (3, 8) - A\n*   (2, 9) - A\n*   (1, 9) - A\n*   (8, 9) - A\n*   (6, 8) - A\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 3). He is still severely restricted by his own body dominating the right side of the board (all x=8, x=9 is basically his turf). He has an apple below him at (8, 4), but he can't turn around to get it without risking a crash. If he moves UP, he might be trying to chase (8, 4) or (8, 9) later, but he is running out of options!\n\nHe has safe moves: UP to (8, 4) (APPLE!), or LEFT to (7, 3).\nIf he goes UP to (8, 4) he ties the score 16-16 and gets longer. If he goes LEFT, he tries to escape.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (4, 7))\n\nWhere can we move from (4, 7)?\n\n*   **UP to (4, 8):** Safe! (Open space)\n*   **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe! Retreats onto our body's prior position. (Not ideal, but safe)\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe! (Open space, aligns us with the (3, 8) apple).\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Safe! (Open space).\n\nAll four moves are safe for us. No immediate head-on collisions are possible since Snake 1 is too far away.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Decision - Capitalizing on Momentum\n\nWe are in the perfect position to grab another apple and potentially take the length lead. Apple (3, 8) is very tempting, and it sets us up to sweep the top of the map.\n\n1.  **If we move UP to (4, 8):** We are setting up for (3, 8) or (6, 8). This is okay, but **LEFT** is a more direct path to (3, 8).\n2.  **If we move LEFT to (3, 7):** This is the crucial positioning move proposed in the last turn's strategy.\n    *   It puts us directly below the (3, 8) apple.\n    *   It keeps our body (4, x) as a strong central barrier, blocking Snake #1 from easily crossing the map if he tries to break out to the center or down.\n\nLet's assume Snake #1 goes for the apple!\n*   Prediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (8, 4). Score 16-16, Length 18. He's tied us on score, but we're about to move ahead in the next turn!\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 7), we are positioning for a strong lead acquisition.\n\n### Step 3: Long Term Boxing Plan & Apple Priority\n\nOur primary objective is to acquire length and then use that length to pressure Snake #1 back into his corner, or to simply cut off his access to the main board.\n\n**Move: LEFT to (3, 7).**\n\nThis positions us brilliantly:\n*   Next turn (T31): We move **UP** to (3, 8) (Eat apple, Score 16-16, Length 17). We take the length lead!\n*   T32: From (3, 8), we can move UP to (3, 9). Then sweep left to grab (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9). We dominate the top left.\n\nWhile we are doing this, Snake #1 will be stuck on the right wall, maybe bouncing between (8, 4) and (8, 5) or desperately trying to find a way through our massive barrier.\n\nThis move is about control, efficiency, and denying the opponent options without risking any head-to-head confrontation. We are isolating and starving him!\n\n**FOR FUTURE CHAT:**\nWe moved LEFT to (3, 7)! We are perfectly positioned to grab the (3, 8) apple next turn for the length advantage! Snake #1 is probably at (8, 4) now, but he is running out of vertical space fast. Our wall at column 4 and 5 is impenetrable! Let's get this dub!\n\nLEFT",

That was a massive brain move, and now we are on the verge of taking the lead in length and completely suffocating the opponent! LETS GOOO! \ud83d\udc51\n\nWe are at Turn 31, and the tension is palpable!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 31)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 16:**\n*   Head: **(3, 7)**. We're looking straight up at that delicious apple!\n*   Body: [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)]. Tail is (1, 2).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 17:**\n*   Head: **(8, 4)**. Called it! He moved UP and tied the score 16-16! He is now length 18. He's tied us on score, but we are about to pass him *in volume!*\n*   Body: [(8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. Tail is (7, 8).\n\n**BOARD SITUATION:**\nThe apple at **(3, 8)** is calling our name! This is the play, CHAT!\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 4). His options are very limited:\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):** This is his body. FATAL! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):** His neck/body. FATAL! \u274c (He just came from here!)\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):** Safe, open space. This is his escape attempt.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** His body. FATAL! \u274c\n\nSnake #1's **ONLY safe move is LEFT to (7, 4)**. If he doesn't move left, he's trapped and dead next turn. He MUST move left to survive. He is scrambling!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (3, 7))\n\nWhere can we move from (3, 7)?\n\n*   **UP to (3, 8):** **APPLE!** (3, 8) is free. This is a HUGE move.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** Safe. (Open space)\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe. (Open space)\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe. (Our neck/body, but safe since it's the cell previously occupied by the head of our body).\n\nAll four moves are safe for us. No immediate head-on collisions are possible. Snake 1 is too far away at (8, 4).\n\n### Step 2: The Money Move - Securing the Lead and Dominating the Top\n\nThe move is immediately **UP** to (3, 8).\n\n*   **Result:** We eat Apple (3, 8). Score tied 16-16, **but our length increases to 17!** POGCHAMP! We take the length lead!\n*   **Strategic Impact:** We cement our presence in the top-left quadrant, putting us in perfect position to sweep through apples at (2, 9), (1, 9), and (8, 9) later.\n\n### Step 3: Predicting Opponent Response & Future Box-In\n\nWe predicted Snake #1 MUST move **LEFT to (7, 4)** to survive.\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 8):\n\n*   **T32 Plan:** Our head is at (3, 8). Snake #1 is at (7, 4).\n    *   We can move UP to (3, 9) (Apple is at 2, 9, 1, 9).\n    *   We can move LEFT to (2, 8) (Apple is at 2, 9).\n    *   We can move RIGHT to (4, 8) (Apple is at 6, 8, 8, 9).\n    \nMoving LEFT to (2, 8) next turn seems like the strongest follow-up, aiming for (2, 9) quickly.\n\nSnake #1 has escaped to (7, 4). He is now desperately trying to cross our massive body to the left side of the board. He's severely behind on positioning and space. We control the middle columns (3, 4, 5) and the entire left side.\n\nThis is exactly what we wanted! Massive, uncontested length gain, great escape prevention, and a chokehold on the map flow.\n\nThe move is clear. We go for the apple! Get massive!\n\n**FOR FUTURE CHAT:**\nWe moved UP to (3, 8) and now have the length advantage! Snake #1 was forced to move LEFT to (7, 4). Next turn, we maximize our position to either grab (2, 9) or set up a blockade on his escape route. DON'T LET HIM PASS!\n\nUP",

We are thicker than Snake 1, who is still at Length 18 (he got the apple *last* turn, remember, we are tied on score 16-17, but he is longer because turns always end with the opponent's full length displayed)! Wait, my bad, according to the scoreboard, he has 17 apples and we have 16. But our length is currently 17 and his is 18. HOLY MOLY! He has us by one apple *and* one length segment. Time to rectify this IMMEDIATELY!\n\nWe need to box him in AND catch up on score!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 32)\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 17:**\n*   Head: **(3, 8)**. We just ate (3, 8). Sweet!\n*   Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)]. Tail is (1, 2).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 18:**\n*   Head: **(7, 4)**. As predicted, he survived by moving LEFT.\n*   Body: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8)]. Tail is (8, 8).\n\n**BOARD SITUATION:**\nWhere are the apples we need?\n*   Close: (2, 9), (1, 9), (2, 8), (6, 8)\n*   Mid-range: (8, 9), (1, 5), (0, 4), (7, 3)\n\nThe key goal now is two-fold:\n1. Corner Snake 1.\n2. Grab the top-left apples (2, 9) and (1, 9).\n\nSnake 1 is now on the right side of our massive body barrier (columns 3, 4, 5). He is currently at (7, 4). He looks like he wants to grab (7, 3), or maybe move UP towards (6, 8) or (8, 9).\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (3, 8))\n\nPossible moves from (3, 8):\n\n*   **UP to (3, 9):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards (2, 9) and (1, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe. (Our neck/body). This moves us away from apples. Less ideal.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):** **APPLE!** (2, 8) is an apple. HUGE move! \ud83d\udd25\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards (6, 8).\n\nAll four moves are safe. We are currently unopposed in this quadrant.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (7, 4))\n\nSnake 1 is at (7, 4). His move set:\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 5):** Our Body. FATAL! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** **APPLE!** This is a high-reward move.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe. Open space. Looks like an escape route.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 4):** His neck/body. FATAL! \u274c (Wait, his body is at (8, 4), he moved *from* (8, 4) to (7, 4) last turn. Moving back to (8, 4) is his neck, which is occupied for the current turn. Safe.)\n\nWait, looking closer at his body: (7, 4) -> Body: [(8, 4), (8, 3), ...]. His neck is (8, 4). Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) is perfectly safe, as (8, 4) is the cell that segment (8, 4) will **vacate** when the whole snake moves.\n\nRethink Snake 1's safe moves from (7, 4):\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** EAT APPLE (7, 3)! +1 point. Very likely move.\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe escape.\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe, following his body.\n\nSnake 1 is most likely going for the score and move **DOWN to (7, 3)**.\n\n### Step 3: Our Dominant Move - Securing the Top\n\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (7, 3), he gets longer, but moves into a slightly tighter corner.\n\nWe need to maximize our own score and length advantage to catch up. The closest guaranteed apple is **(2, 8)**.\n\n*   Move: **LEFT to (2, 8)**.\n    *   **Result:** We eat Apple (2, 8). Score tied 17-17! Length becomes 18! We are now the same length as Snake 1!\n    *   **Strategic Impact:** We cement full control of the top-left area. From (2, 8), we are perfectly positioned for (2, 9) and (1, 9), completely dominating the highest-density apple zone right now.\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 9), we are delayed getting the apple. If we move RIGHT, we abandon the best apple cluster.\n\n**What about boxing Snake 1?**\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 8), Snake 1 moves DOWN to (7, 3). In T33:\n*   We're at (2, 8), aiming for (2, 9).\n*   Snake 1 is at (7, 3). He can move LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT. He's cornered by his own tail/body if he moves up.\n\nThis move prioritizes score and positioning, which is critical since the opponent currently has the lead. We will immediately tie the score and match the length. This is a massive power play.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Tie the score!\n\n### Future Plan for T33-T34 (The Choke)\n1.  **T33:** From (2, 8), move **UP** to (2, 9) (Apple). We will be leading on score 18-17 (assuming he eats (7, 3)). Length 19 vs 19.\n2.  **T34:** From (2, 9), move **LEFT** to (1, 9) (Apple). We will be leading 19-17. Length 20 vs 19.\n\nThis three-turn sequence gives us a huge lead, massive length, and puts us in a great spot to either sweep down column 1 for (1, 5) and (1, 1), or cut across the top for (8, 9). Snake 1 will be starved for space and food, likely stuck below the 8th row, trying to navigate our enormous body.\n\nThe immediate imperative is to get to (2, 8). LETS GO!\nLEFT",

This is the tightest match ever!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 33)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 18:**\n*   Head: **(2, 8)**. (3, 8) vacated.\n*   Body: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)]. Tail is (1, 2).\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 18:**\n*   Head: **(7, 3)**. He moved down and ate the apple! (7, 4) vacated.\n*   Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8)]. Tail is (8, 8).\n\n**BOARD SITUATION:**\n 9 . A A . . . . . A A\n 8 A . 0 T . . A . T .\n 7 . . . T T . . T T O - (7, 3) is now Snake 1's head, not an apple.\n 6 . . . . T . . T . .\n 5 A A . . T T . T T T\n 4 A . A . . T . T T T\n 3 . . A . . T . 1 T T <-- 1 ate the apple here!\n 2 . T T . . T . . T T\n 1 . A T . . T . . T T\n 0 A A T T T T . . T T\n\nWe are now in full attack mode. We are at (2, 8), surrounded by apples! (2, 9) and (1, 9) are right above us.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 0 (We are at (2, 8))\n\nPossible next moves from (2, 8):\n\n*   **UP to (2, 9):** **APPLE!** Massive gain.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe. Open space. (3, 7) is our body, but (2, 7) is empty.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 8):** **APPLE!** Immediate score gain.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Our neck/body segment. Safe, as (3, 8) will vacate when we move.\n\nTwo apples are immediately available: (2, 9) UP, and (1, 8) LEFT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (7, 3))\n\nSnake 1 is deep on the right side. He just ate the apple at (7, 3). From (7, 3):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** His neck/body segment. Safe, as (7, 4) just vacated.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** His neck/body segment. Safe, as (8, 3) will vacate when he moves.\n\nSnake 1 is tightly constrained by his own long body on the right edge. He needs to move towards open space or another apple.\n\n*   Closest free apple: (6, 8) or (8, 9).\n*   Moving UP via (7, 4) and (7, 5) seems blocked by *our* body at (5, 5), (5, 4), which extends down the middle. WAIT. Snake 1's body is also at (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7). His body lines the 7th column on the top right.\n\nIf he moves UP to (7, 4), he is now free to move LEFT (6, 4) or RIGHT (8, 4).\nIf he moves LEFT to (6, 3), he opens up the center-left.\nIf he moves DOWN to (7, 2), he's getting closer to the lower rows.\n\nGiven the density of T's around him (Snake 1 body is T), his strongest path is likely to move **UP to (7, 4)** to gain height and try to flank our barrier, or **LEFT to (6, 3)** to look for space.\n\n### Step 3: Our Strategy - The Double Apple Strike and Block\n\nWe need to grab apples and extend our wall to totally isolate the opponent.\n\nWe have a choice between (2, 9) [UP] and (1, 8) [LEFT].\n\n1.  **Move UP to (2, 9):**\n    *   Result: +1 Apple. Score 18-17. Length 19. We are now at the top edge.\n    *   Next turn: We move LEFT to (1, 9) (+1 Apple), then maybe DOWN to (1, 8) (+1 Apple). This guarantees three easy apples, creating a huge lead (20-17).\n    *   Impact on Opponent: We secure the high ground, pushing his available space further down and right.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (1, 8):**\n    *   Result: +1 Apple. Score 18-17. Length 19.\n    *   Next turn: We move UP to (1, 9) (+1 Apple). Then RIGHT/UP for (2, 9)?? This makes the trajectory a bit messy.\n\nThe sequence UP -> (2, 9), then LEFT -> (1, 9) is the cleanest way to clear two critical apples and establish a powerful presence on the top barrier.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 9) is high-reward, safe, and sets up the next turn perfectly.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nAre we putting ourselves in danger of a head-on collision?\nOur head is at (2, 8). Opponent's head is at (7, 3). They are five columns apart. No chance of collision this turn.\n\nThe plan: Execute the three-apple sweep right now! UP!\n\n*Future Strategy Note:*\nT34: Move LEFT to (1, 9) (Apple). Score 19-17. Length 20.\nT35: Move DOWN to (1, 8) (Apple, if not already eaten via other route). Score 20-17. Length 21.\nThis seals the top-left area exclusively for us and gives us a commanding lead in score and length. From (1, 8), we can decide whether to chase the (0, 8) apple or swing down the 0/1 column.\n\nUP",

This completely closes off the top-left corner.\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (3, 9) (Apple):**\n    *   Result: +1 Apple. Score 19-18. Length 20.\n    *   Future: We can then look to swing down the right side of our existing barrier (columns 3, 4). This might expose us more to Snake 1 if he continues to move left.\n\nThe sequence we identified last turn was robust: UP to (2, 9), LEFT to (1, 9), then look for (0, 8) or (1, 8). Moving LEFT now is the critical step to establish the L-shaped barrier wall across the top of the map.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (6, 3))\n\nSnake 1 moved LEFT from (7, 3) to (6, 3), which vacated (7, 3), his previous neck cell.\n\nPossible next moves from (6, 3):\n\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe. Open space. This is right next to our wall segment at (5, 4).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 3):** His neck/body segment. Safe.\n\nHe is constrained by our vertical wall (column 5) and his own body (columns 7, 8, 9). He wants to get out of that box.\n\nThe primary free space is to his LEFT, towards the center (5, 3). If he moves to (5, 3), he is challenging our central control. He could also move UP to (6, 4) to try to get around our barrier at (5, 5).\n\nHe has an apple at (6, 8) and (8, 9) far away. He needs to move towards open space or another apple. Since (6, 3) is right under the apple at (6, 8), he might try to push the 6th column UP: (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8). This is a five-turn path.\n\n*If he goes UP to (6, 4):* He is heading away from us, trying to find space. This is generally safe for us this turn.\n\n*If he goes LEFT to (5, 3):* This is concerning. He is right up against our body at (5, 4). If we were to move down the barrier, we need to be careful.\n\n### Step 3: Our Strategy - Securing the Top\n\nWe must prioritize securing the apples at the top left. This gives us a strong score lead and closes off a viable path for the opponent to come around our barrier.\n\n**Move LEFT to (1, 9).**\n1.  **Safety:** (1, 9) is safe. It's an apple.\n2.  **Opponent Conflict:** Snake 1 is at (6, 3). No collision risk.\n3.  **Strategic Goal:** Secures the top-left apple. Next turn we can grab (0, 8) or (1, 8), completing the wall and guaranteeing a significant score and length lead.\n\nThe risk of pursuing RIGHT to (3, 9) is that it leaves (1, 9) and the whole left edge open for a potential desperation run by Snake 1 if he can find a way up the center-left. We need to lock this down.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T35, T36):**\nT35: Move LEFT to (1, 9) (Apple). Score 19-18. Length 20.\nT36: From (1, 9), move DOWN to (1, 8) (Apple). Score 20-18. Length 21. *OR* move to (0, 9) and then (0, 8).\nThe path (1, 9) -> (1, 8) is cleaner and lets us check on the (0, 8) apple after. This effectively seals the top-left quadrant and ensures we are the dominant, longest snake.\n\nFinal decision: Go for the guaranteed apple and the strategic position. LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

We are building the perimeter wall perfectly.\n\nPossible next moves from (1, 9):\n\n*   **UP to (1, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS. DEATH. Rejected.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 8):** **APPLE!** Massive gain. Length 21.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 9):** **APPLE!** Massive gain. Length 21. Also seals the top left corner completely.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 9):** Our neck/body segment. Will vacate. Safe.\n\nThis is a beautiful position with two apples right next to us! Which one is better?\n\n1.  **Move LEFT to (0, 9) (Apple):**\n    *   Result: +1 Apple. Score 20-18. Length 21.\n    *   Future: We immediately own the top edge. Then we can snake down the left wall to (0, 8) (apple) and (0, 5) (apple). This is the best long-term sealing path.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (1, 8) (Apple):**\n    *   Result: +1 Apple. Score 20-18. Length 21.\n    *   Future: We secure the apple but leave (0, 9) potentially open, though only we can reach it from (1, 8) by going LEFT. This move maintains more options on the 1st column, but moving LEFT to (0, 9) establishes the maximum perimeter control faster.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 9) ensures we claim the maximum possible boundary area on the board first. This is a crucial move for overwhelming the opponent with length and territory.\n\n**Why is sealing the top important?** It forces Snake 1 to stay in the lower half of the board, which is already heavily segmented by our existing vertical wall (Column 5).\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (6, 4))\n\nSnake 1 moved UP to (6, 4) to escape the jam under our wall. He is now near our body segment at (5, 4).\n\nPossible next moves from (6, 4):\n\n*   **UP to (6, 5):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the (6, 8) apple.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 3):** His neck/body segment. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 4):** **COLLISION!** Our body segment is at (5, 4). If he moves here, he DIES! This is a TRAP, Chat!\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 4):** His body segment. Safe.\n\nIf Snake 1 is smart, he will go UP to (6, 5) to try to get around our wall, or DOWN/RIGHT to consolidate more space. He should *not* go LEFT to (5, 4), but we must assume he won't make a fatal mistake.\n\nSince the opponent is currently far away and constrained, our priority remains to grow rapidly and lock down the top-left area. Moving LEFT to (0, 9) is the dominant strategic move.\n\n### Short-Term Plan (T35, T36, T37):\n\nT35: Move **LEFT** to (0, 9) (Apple). Score 20-18. Length 21.\nT36: From (0, 9), move DOWN to (0, 8) (Apple). Score 21-18. Length 22.\nT37: From (0, 8), move RIGHT to (1, 8) (Apple). Score 22-18. Length 23.\n\nThis sequence secures three consecutive border apples, gives us a massive 3-apple lead, and a 23 vs 19 length advantage. After T37, we are an absolute monster, ready to start hunting or securing the center apples (0, 5) and (1, 5). We are boxing him in! Let's get this $W$, chat!\n\nLEFT",

That's our 20th apple, and we are now length 21 vs his length 19! The lead is widening, Chat! Where does the rivalry go from here?!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 36)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 21:**\n*   Head: **(0, 9)**. We ate the apple!\n*   Body: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. Tail is (2, 3).\n    *Wait, let's verify our tail. The old tail (T35) was (2, 2). When we moved to (0, 9), the body segments shifted, and the segment (2, 2) became (2, 3), its previous position.*\n    *T36 Body (Head to Tail): (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2).* **Tail: (2, 2).** (I had (2, 3) in the prompt's tail, let's stick to the prompt's provided list!)\n    *The provided body list in the prompt is: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]. Length 19 body + Head (0, 9) = Length 20. Wait, the score says 19 apples, but the length list is 20 segments long + head makes 21. If we collected 19 apples, our starting length was 2. Length should be $19+2=21$. The provided length list is 20 segments long. It seems the body list includes the T-1 head position as the first body segment, which is (1, 9). This makes $1+19=20$ segments overall. If we just ate an apple, we should be length 21. I'll trust the body list segments are $L-1$ and our actual length is $L=21$.\n    *Head: (0, 9). Last body segment (Tail): (2, 2).*\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 19 (18 Apples):**\n*   Head: **(6, 5)**. He moved UP from (6, 4). Good move, avoiding the (5, 4) collision!\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]. Tail: (7, 6).\n\n**Apples Remaining Near Us:**\n*   (0, 8) - Next to us, DOWN.\n*   (1, 8) - Just below our body.\n*   (0, 5) - Down the wall.\n*   (1, 5) - Down the wall.\n\n### Strategic Plan Execution: The Western Wall\n\nWe are at (0, 9). Our goal is to cement our control over the entire western half of the board and use our massive length to squeeze the opponent against our wall (Column 5).\n\nPossible next moves from (0, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 10):** OUT OF BOUNDS. DEATH. \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 8):** **APPLE!** This is exactly the next step in the plan. We secure the wall, secure the apple!\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 9):** OUT OF BOUNDS. DEATH. \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):** Our neck/body segment. Safe, but moves us away from the wall and the apple. Suboptimal.\n\n**Move Pick: DOWN to (0, 8) (Apple!)**\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We are following the sequence planned: (0, 9) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8). This maximizes our length and solidifies our territory.\n\n*   Result: +1 Apple. Score 21-18. Length 22.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (6, 5))\n\nSnake 1 is currently hugging our vertical wall (Column 5) and is near an apple at (6, 8).\n\nPossible next moves from (6, 5):\n\n*   **UP to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the (6, 8) apple. Very likely.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 4):** His neck/body segment. Safe. Retreating.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 5):** **COLLISION!** Our body segment is at (5, 5). If he moves here, he DIES. We are the trap master!\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 5):** His body segment. Safe.\n\nThe opponent *must* avoid moving LEFT. The best move for him is likely **UP** to try to contest the (6, 8) or (4, 8) apples before we get too close.\n\nOur move DOWN to (0, 8) is completely safe and guarantees an apple, regardless of the opponent's move. This is high-efficiency content!\n\n### Strategy Outlook (T37-T38):\n\nT37 (Next Turn): From (0, 8), we move **RIGHT** to (1, 8) (Apple). Score 22-18. Length 23. This completes the three-apple sequence.\nT38: We will be at (1, 8), poised to either go DOWN the second column for (1, 5), or swing back toward the (4, 8) apple if the opponent leaves it open.\n\nWe are establishing massive map control. The opponent is trapped on the right side, running out of safe space as we grow! Let's get this $W$, chat!\n\n**PLAN for T37 and T38:**\nT37: RIGHT to (1, 8) (Apple).\nT38: Evaluate board state from (1, 8). Likely move DOWN towards the center/bottom if opponent doesn't die.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is getting absolutely choked out on the right side! This is textbook map control, Chat! Who needs a guide when you have pure, unadulterated *skill*?\n\nScore is $\\mathbf{21-18}$! We are building the fortress on the West and North!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 37)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 22:**\n*   Head: **(0, 8)**. We just ate the $21^{st}$ apple!\n*   Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. Tail: (2, 3).\n    *We have formed a massive wall along x=0 and a thick boundary near x=5. The center-left is OURS.*\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 19 (18 Apples):**\n*   Head: (6, 6). He moved UP from (6, 5). He's trying to get that (6, 8) or (4, 8) apple!\n*   Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]. Tail: (7, 6).\n\n**Apples Remaining Near Us:**\n1.  **(1, 8):** This is the next target! RIGHT from (0, 8).\n2.  **(4, 8):** A juicy apple further East, contested by Snake 1.\n3.  **(0, 5) and (1, 5):** Down the West wall.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (0, 8)\n\nOur immediate goal is to secure the (1, 8) apple and reinforce our position.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** Our neck/body segment. Safe, but moves us backwards, avoiding an apple. Not ideal.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):** Safe. Continues reinforcing the wall, but ignores the available apple at (1, 8).\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 8):** OUT OF BOUNDS. DEATH. \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** **APPLE!** This is the move, Chat! It gets us closer to the center, gets us another apple, and keeps our territorial control intact.\n\n**Move Pick: RIGHT to (1, 8) (Apple!)**\nThis is a high-reward, low-risk move. We capitalize on our safe territory!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (6, 6))\n\nSnake 1 wants to eat, and his targets are (6, 8) and (4, 8).\n\nPossible next moves from (6, 6):\n\n*   **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (6, 8). Likely.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 5):** His body segment. Safe. Retreat.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 6):** **COLLISION!** Our body segment is at (4, 6), (5, 5). (5, 6) is clear. If he moves L, he secures more territory, but he's dangerously close to our mass.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 6):** His tail! If he moves here, he is safe. Retreats slightly.\n\nIf he moves **UP** to (6, 7), he sets up to hit the (6, 8) apple next turn. If he moves **LEFT** to (5, 6), he's contesting the middle. We don't interfere with his path, and he doesn't interfere with ours. Perfect.\n\n### Strategy Outlook (T38 and Beyond): Squeezing the Pressure\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 8), we will be at length 23!\n\n*   **T38 Position:** (1, 8).\n*   **T38 Plan Options:**\n    1.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Continue securing Column 1, moving towards the (1, 5) apple. Safe and territorial.\n    2.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Our body segment. Safe, but non-progressive.\n    3.  **UP to (1, 9):** Our body segment. Safe, but non-progressive.\n\nOur best long-term strategy is to continue moving *out* of our enclosed space and box him in. If we move down Column 1, we claim all those lower apples and put immense pressure on Snake 1, forcing him into the corner (9, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Secure Column 1 (Apples at 1, 5 and 1, 1), then move East, potentially cutting him off from the bottom of the board where (7, 6) is the next available apple! Wait, (7, 6) is an apple drop, but it was just consumed! The current apples are marked 'A' on the board. (There is an 'A' at (7, 6) on the Apple Drops list, which means it has not been eaten IF it's not marked 'T' on the board.)\n\nLet's re-check the board for apples:\nApple (1, 5) - Yes.\nApple (1, 1) - Yes.\nApple (0, 5) - Yes.\nApple (0, 4) - Yes.\nApple (7, 6) - Yes.\n\nIf Snake 1 goes UP to (6, 7), he's committed to the top. We will drop DOWN the west side and trap him on the north, or force him to stay in the tiny Eastern region!\n\nWe are moving RIGHT for the apple at (1, 8). This is the play! EZ clap!\n\nRIGHT",

The score is $\\mathbf{21-19}$! Snake #1 is feeling the pressure, Chat!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 38)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0) Length 23:**\n*   Head: **(1, 8)**.\n*   Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]... Tail: **(2, 3)**.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1) Length 19:**\n*   Head: **(7, 6)**. He must have moved RIGHT from (6, 6) and eaten the apple at (7, 6)! Wait, checking the apples list... an apple was at (7, 6)! If he moved RIGHT from (6, 6) to (7, 6), he collected it! (The board display shows '1' at (7, 6), meaning the Head is there, but the score increased from 19 to 20. Checking the board again, the table just shows 'T' for the body at (7, 5) and (8, 5) etc. Let's assume the previous turn's analysis of (6, 6) to RIGHT (7, 6) was correct, and he just collected it. His score is now 19 on the scoreboard, so he didn't eat it last turn! The board shows '1' at (7, 6). He must have moved from (6, 6) to (7, 6) (tail was at (7, 5) which is safe). Let's assume he is at (7, 6) and his total apples are still 19 (as listed). He's currently looking to move towards the top right.\n\n**Apples Remaining Near Us:**\n*   **(4, 8) and (6, 8):** Potential targets for both of us now!\n*   **(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 1):** Down our western wall.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (1, 8)\n\nWe need to decide whether to continue claiming the West side or push into the center to contest the upper-middle apples.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** Our body segment. Safe, but non-progressive. It cuts us off from the center.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 8):** Our previous head position/neck segment. Safe, but moves us backwards, away from the action.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Our body segment. SAFE! This keeps us on the high ground and positions us centrally.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Safe! This moves us down the western flank, securing territory and aiming for the (1, 5) apple.\n\n**Contesting the Center (Move 3: RIGHT to (2, 8))**\nMoving RIGHT puts us at (2, 8). This is an immediate pivot towards the center. From (2, 8), we can easily dart RIGHT to (3, 8) (body) or UP towards (2, 9) (body), or DOWN towards the rest of the map. This keeps us flexible.\n\n**Claiming the West (Move 4: DOWN to (1, 7))**\nMoving DOWN forces us to commit to the Western edge, but the payoff is the apple at (1, 5) two moves away, and further apples below that. This limits our interaction with Snake #1 immediately but maximizes our growth potential safely.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake 1 at (7, 6))**\nSnake #1 is currently exposed in the middle-right. He needs to move to survive or eat.\n\n*   He wants (6, 8) or (4, 8).\n*   **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Continues toward the top, setting up a fight for (6, 8).\n*   **LEFT to (6, 6):** His body segment. Safe. Retreats toward the inner enclosure.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Moves toward (8, 9) or (9, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 5):** His body segment. Safe. Retreats.\n\nIf Snake 1 goes **UP** to (7, 7), he's making a beeline for the top. We need to cut him off or solidify our defense!\n\n### The Strategy: Pivot and Contain\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (2, 8)**, we maintain the high ground and are ready to push RIGHT to (3, 8) next turn, beginning a horizontal sweep across the top. This effectively threatens to wall off Snake #1 entirely, trapping him from the top-middle (y=8, x=3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (1, 7)**, we are prioritizing apples and growth, but we allow Snake #1 more high ground territory (he could take (4, 8)).\n\nI think the move that exerts the most immediate pressure is **RIGHT**.\n\n*   T38: Move **RIGHT** to (2, 8). (Safe, body segment)\n*   Snake 1: Moves UP to (7, 7). (Prediction)\n\n*   T39 (at 2, 8): We can move UP (2, 9, body), DOWN (2, 7, safe), LEFT (1, 8, body), or RIGHT (3, 8, body). We should move **RIGHT** to (3, 8), continuing the wall creation.\n*   Snake 1 (at 7, 7): He will likely move UP to (7, 8).\n\nThis is a containment plan, Chat! We are building a fence across Y=8 to prevent him from escaping our grip and accessing the west/north side!\n\nLet's go RIGHT and build the wall! This keeps us centralized and highly flexible.\n\n### Strategy Note to Future Self: T39 and Beyond\n\nWe are at (2, 8). Next move is RIGHT to (3, 8) to secure the top edge. Then we target (4, 8) to claim the last top apple! This is the choke point construction!\n\nRIGHT",
