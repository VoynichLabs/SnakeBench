          "rationale": "The current turn is 0. My snake (ID 1) is at (0, 3) and the enemy snake (ID 0) is at (1, 1). Both snakes are length 1.\nThe board is 10x10.\n\nMy goal is to eat apples safely and grow, while avoiding collision with the enemy or walls.\n\n**Available Apples:**\n(5, 8), (3, 5), (9, 8), (5, 3), (9, 9), (6, 6), (6, 0), (1, 5), (7, 4), (2, 3), (5, 5), (2, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0), (2, 0)\n\n**My position (1): (0, 3)**\n**Enemy position (0): (1, 1)**\n\n**1. Evaluate immediate moves for Snake 1 (at (0, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP (to (0, 4)):** Safe. Stays close to the wall.\n*   **DOWN (to (0, 2)):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to (-1, 3)):** DEAD (out of bounds).\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 3)):** Safe. This moves towards the center and perhaps some apples.\n\n**2. Analyze safe moves and potential collisions with Snake 0 (at (1, 1)):**\n\nSnake 0 is far away, so a head-on collision or collision with its body is highly unlikely this turn, as both snakes are length 1. We only need to ensure we don't land on (1, 1) if snake 0 doesn't move, or land on snake 0's new head position.\n\nLet's assume Snake 0 is also trying to optimize for apples.\nClosest apples for Snake 0 (1, 1): (2, 0), (2, 3), (1, 5), (4, 0), (5, 3), (5, 5).\nIf Snake 0 moves:\n*   UP (to (1, 2))\n*   DOWN (to (1, 0)) -> Apple (1,0) doesn't exist. Closest is (2, 0) or (4, 0).\n*   LEFT (to (0, 1))\n\nSince Snake 0 is at (1, 1), it is unlikely to interact with my snake at (0, 3) in one move, unless I move RIGHT to (1, 3) and Snake 0 moves UP to (1, 2) or something similar.\n\n**3. Choose the best move for Snake 1:**\n\nMy immediate goal is to reach an apple.\nApples near (0, 3): (2, 3), (1, 5), (3, 5).\n\n*   If I move **UP** to (0, 4): Next turn, I could go UP towards (1, 5) or RIGHT towards (2, 3).\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (0, 2): Next turn, I could go RIGHT towards (2, 3) or DOWN towards (0, 0) (not an apple). This seems less promising for apples immediately.\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (1, 3): This moves directly towards the apple at (2, 3) (2 moves away). Also gives access to (3, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT seems most direct towards nearby apples (2, 3) and (3, 5).\n\nLet's check the proximity to (2, 3) from my current (0, 3):\nCurrent: (0, 3).\nTarget: (2, 3).\nRIGHT -> (1, 3).\nRIGHT -> (2, 3) (Apple!).\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 4):\nUP -> (0, 5)\nRIGHT -> (1, 5) (Apple!). This takes 2 moves as well.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to an apple in 2 turns if the path is clear. (2, 3) is a bit more central. (1, 5) is also good.\n\nLet's consider possible future interaction with Snake 0. Snake 0 is at (1, 1).\nIf S0 goes UP to (1, 2), it's aiming for apples like (1, 5) or (2, 3) or (3, 5).\nIf S0 goes UP, then to (1, 3) in 2 turns. If I move RIGHT to (1, 3) now, I claim that column sooner.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 3):\nIf S0 moves UP to (1, 2), we are close but safe.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 1), it targets (2, 3) eventually.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 4):\nIf S0 moves UP to (1, 2), S0 is positioned to compete for (1, 5) or (2, 3). I am positioned better for (1, 5).\n\nThe apple at (2, 3) is very central to the early skirmish zone.\nMy move RIGHT to (1, 3) puts me on the diagonal path to (2, 3) (1, 3) -> (2, 3).\nMy move UP to (0, 4) puts me on the path to (1, 5) (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (1, 5) or (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3).\n\n(1, 5) is 1 unit further away in Y than (2, 3) is in X.\n(0, 3) to (2, 3) is 2 RIGHT.\n(0, 3) to (1, 5) is 1 RIGHT, 2 UP, or 2 UP, 1 RIGHT.\n\nMoving UP to (0, 4) seems slightly more flexible and keeps me along the wall longer, which can be safer initially. It also puts me on a good path for (1, 5) (2 moves away via (0, 5) then RIGHT) or (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize getting an apple quickly while maintaining safety.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I have a clear shot at (2, 3) next turn (assuming I go RIGHT again). S0 is at (1, 1). If S0 goes UP to (1, 2), it's unlikely to reach (2, 3) before me. If S0 goes RIGHT to (2, 1), it's 2 moves away from (2, 3). I am 1 move away from (2, 3) if I move RIGHT now.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (to (1, 3)):\nTurn 1: S1 at (1, 3). If S0 goes UP to (1, 2).\nTurn 2: S1 RIGHT to (2, 3) (EAT). S0 could go RIGHT/UP towards me or continue up to (1, 4).\n\nIf I move UP (to (0, 4)):\nTurn 1: S1 at (0, 4). If S0 goes UP to (1, 2).\nTurn 2: S1 RIGHT to (1, 4). S0 could go UP to (1, 3).\nTurn 3: S1 could go RIGHT to (2, 4) or UP to (1, 5) (EAT).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 3) gives me a chance to secure (2, 3) in T+1, which is the fastest route to an apple.\n\nLet's confirm safety for RIGHT to (1, 3).\n1. Out of bounds? No.\n2. Into body? No (length 1).\n3. Head-on collision? S0 is at (1, 1). For S0 to collide with me at (1, 3), S0 would need to move UP twice (impossible in one turn) or move to (1, 3) from an adjacent square (impossible in one turn). Safe.\n\nI will take the aggressive route towards (2, 3).\n\nLong-term plan: Secure (2, 3), then evaluate if (3, 5) or (1, 5) is better based on S0's position. I want to control the lower-left quadrant initially.\n\nRIGHT",

Maybe S0 goes RIGHT towards (4, 0)?\n*   (1, 0): Empty.\n*   (2, 1): S0 body.\n\n**Apples in my vicinity:**\n1.  (3, 5): 3 moves away (e.g., R, U, U).\n2.  (1, 5): 3 moves away (e.g., L, U, U).\n3.  (5, 3): 3 moves away (e.g., R, R, R).\n4.  (5, 5): 4 moves away.\n\nMy goal is to find the next safe move that maximizes apple collection and maintains board control, specifically keeping far from the enemy snake currently at the bottom center.\n\n---\n**1. Evaluate possible moves for Snake 1 (at (2, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP (to (2, 4)):** Safe. Moves toward the center/top half.\n    *   Target: (2, 9) (5 moves), (1, 5) (3 moves via (1, 4)).\n*   **DOWN (to (2, 2)):** Safe. Moves perpendicular to the enemy, but slightly towards them.\n    *   Target: No immediate apples, but keeps central column control.\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 3)):** **Deadly.** This is the cell immediately behind my head (my body segment). Die by moving backwards.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 3)):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 3) or (3, 5).\n    *   Target: (3, 5) (2 moves via (3, 4)). (5, 3) (2 moves via (4, 3)).\n\n---\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake 0's possible moves (at (2, 0)):**\n\nS0 is at (2, 0) and is length 2, body at (2, 1). S0 likely wants (4, 0) or (6, 0).\n\n*   **UP (to (2, 1)):** **Deadly.** Moves into its own body segment. (Moves backwards).\n*   **DOWN (to (2, -1)):** Deadly (Off board).\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 0)):** Safe. Prepares for (4, 0) via the bottom edge or moves away from me.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 0)):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 0) (1 more move). This is the most logical choice for S0.\n\n---\n**3. Future Collision Analysis (T=2):**\n\nMy primary goal is to eat the next apple quickly, which appears to be (3, 5) or (5, 3).\n\n*   **If I move UP to (2, 4):**\n    *   S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0). Safe distance maintained. I am 4 cells away (x-dist: 1, y-dist: 4).\n    *   Next turn (T=3), I could go R to (3, 4) then U to (3, 5) (Apple).\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n    *   S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0). Safe distance maintained. I am 3 cells away (x-dist: 0, y-dist: 3).\n    *   Next turn (T=3), I could go U to (3, 4) then U to (3, 5) (Apple). Or R to (4, 3) then R to (5, 3) (Apple).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 3) seems slightly more opportunistic as it moves towards two apples (3, 5) and (5, 3) directly.\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (2, 2):**\n    *   S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0). I am 2 cells away (x-dist: 1, y-dist: 2). Still safe, but keeps me closer to the enemy. This seems less strategic as it moves away from central apples.\n\n**Decision Detail:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 3) positions me strongly for (3, 5) or (5, 3). Both are 2 moves away from (3, 3) if I am willing to turn immediately.\n\nPath 1: (2, 3) -> RIGHT (3, 3) -> UP (3, 4) -> UP (3, 5) **(Apple T+2)**\nPath 2: (2, 3) -> RIGHT (3, 3) -> RIGHT (4, 3) -> RIGHT (5, 3) **(Apple T+2)**\n\nMoving UP to (2, 4):\nPath 3: (2, 3) -> UP (2, 4) -> RIGHT (3, 4) -> UP (3, 5) **(Apple T+2)**\n\nAll good routes lead to an apple in 3 total turns (T=4). Moving RIGHT (3, 3) keeps more options open for the central column (x=4, x=5) apples, whereas UP (2, 4) commits slightly more to the left side or the central vertical lane. Given the proximity of (5, 3), I prefer moving RIGHT to maintain freedom in the horizontal dimension as well.\n\nWe must ensure S0 moving RIGHT (3, 0) does not position them to threaten (5, 3).\nIf S0 goes to (3, 0), they will likely continue to (4, 0) then (5, 0) or (4, 0) then (4, 1) to target the apple at (5, 3) (5 moves away from (3, 0)). I can get there in 2 moves from (3, 3). I have a clear advantage.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 3). Next turn, assess enemy position (S0 likely at (3, 0) or (4, 0)). If S0 is progressing slowly/horizontally, I will aim for (3, 5) or (5, 3) to secure the next apple. (3, 5) seems safer as it's higher up, away from S0.\n\nRIGHT",

Length: 2, Score: 1.\n\n**Recap of Last Move (Turn 2):**\nI moved RIGHT from (2, 3) to (3, 3). My tail (2, 3) was the former body segment (1, 3).\nThe enemy snake S0 must have moved LEFT from (2, 0) to (1, 0). Its tail (2, 0) was the former body segment (2, 1). This is significant: S0 chose to move LEFT and away from the central action, towards the edge and the apple at (4, 0) or (6, 0) indirectly, or perhaps to target the apple at (1, 5) later.\n\n**Apples Remaining:** (5, 8), (3, 5), (9, 8), (5, 3), (9, 9), (6, 6), (6, 0), (1, 5), (7, 4), (5, 5), (2, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0), (8, 9), (6, 2).\n\n**My Snake's Immediate Environment (Head at (3, 3)):**\n*   (2, 3): My body segment (will disappear if I move away).\n*   (4, 3): Empty.\n*   (3, 4): Empty.\n*   (3, 2): Empty.\n\nNearby Apples:\n1. (3, 5): 2 moves (U, U) or (U, R, L, U...), essentially 2 straight moves.\n2. (5, 3): 2 moves (R, R).\n3. (3, 0): Empty.\n4. (4, 0): Apple (3 moves).\n5. (5, 5): 2 moves (U, R or R, U).\n\n**Enemy Snake's Location and Threats (Head at (1, 0)):**\nS0 is pinned low and left. It has (1, 5) and (4, 0) as potential targets. (4, 0) is 3 moves away (R, R, R), (1, 5) is 5 moves away (U, U, U, U, U).\n\n**S0 Possible Moves from (1, 0):**\n*   **UP (to (1, 1)):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 5).\n*   **DOWN (to (1, -1)):** Deadly (Off board).\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 0)):** Safe. Moves along the bottom wall.\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 0)):** **Deadly.** Moves backwards into its body segment.\n\nS0 must move UP or LEFT.\n\n---\n**1. Evaluate my possible moves for Snake 1 (at (3, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 4)):** Safe. Moves toward apple (3, 5).\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 2)):** Safe. Moves slightly closer to the enemy, away from central apples.\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 3)):** **Deadly.** Backwards move.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 3)):** Safe. Moves toward apple (5, 3) and (5, 5).\n\n---\n**2. Collision and Strategy Analysis:**\n\nMy goal is (3, 5) or (5, 3), both 2 moves away.\n\n**Scenario A: I move UP (to (3, 4))**\n*   If S0 moves UP (to (1, 1)): Safe distance maintained. I am 3 steps from (3, 5) if I go U again.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (to (0, 0)): Safe distance. I am 3 steps from (3, 5).\n\nThis path sets me up to grab (3, 5) on T=4 via UP->UP.\n\n**Scenario B: I move RIGHT (to (4, 3))**\n*   If S0 moves UP (to (1, 1)): Safe distance. I am 3 steps from (5, 3) if I go R again.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (to (0, 0)): Safe distance. I am 3 steps from (5, 3).\n\nThis path sets me up to grab (5, 3) on T=4 via RIGHT->RIGHT. This also opens up (5, 5) more easily (R, U, U or U, R, U).\n\n**Scenario C: I move DOWN (to (3, 2))**\n*   S0 moves (1, 1) or (0, 0). Safe distance. This move seems poor as it moves away from central concentration of apples and deeper towards the enemy's operational area. (4, 0) is only 1 move away, but it's a contested apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to an immediate apple opportunity in 2 moves (Turn 5 total).\nUP towards (3, 5) keeps me closer to the top of the board, which is generally safer/less contested by S0 currently.\nRIGHT towards (5, 3) puts me closer to the center column (x=5) which holds many apples: (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 8).\n\nSince S0 is deep in the corner at (1, 0) and appears focused on the left half or staying low, moving to the right (x=4) seems safe and strategically advantageous for securing the cluster of x=5 apples quickly.\n\nLet's choose RIGHT to aim for (5, 3) / (5, 5), establishing control of the center right.\n\n**Check for S0 Interference at T=4 (If I move R to (4, 3)):**\nS0 is at (1, 0).\nIf S0 goes UP to (1, 1), they will likely continue U towards (1, 5).\nIf S0 goes LEFT to (0, 0), they will likely continue U along the edge.\nEither way, S0 is 4-5 moves away from (5, 3) or (5, 5). No immediate threat.\n\nI choose R.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 3) (T=3). Target apple (5, 3).\nNext turn (T=4), move RIGHT to (5, 3) to eat the apple. This will put me at length 3, head at (5, 3). If (5, 3) is still there, I will take it. If not, I pivot to (5, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Moving into it would kill me.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are both fatal moves - I must choose between UP or LEFT.\n\nApple proximity:\n- Closest apples are at (4,0) [3 right], (6,0) [5 right], (1,5) [4 up], (3,5) [2 right+5 up]\n- (1,5) is accessible by moving UP multiple times\n- (4,0) is accessible by moving RIGHT but that's my body\n- (3,5) is accessible by moving UP then RIGHT\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy is at (3,3) with body at (2,3)\n- If enemy moves DOWN, they could reach (3,2) or (3,1)\n- If enemy moves LEFT, they'd hit their own body at (2,3)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT, they could head toward center apples at (4,0) or (5,3)\n- If enemy moves UP, they could reach (3,4) toward (3,5) apple\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. I'm still in a vulnerable position at the bottom edge - need to move away from the edge\n2. Moving UP toward (1,1) gives me more immediate options and avoids the edge\n3. Moving LEFT toward (0,0) also gets me away from the edge but limits my options to only UP or RIGHT next turn\n4. Need to avoid getting trapped between the enemy and the edge\n5. The (1,5) apple is directly above me and seems like a good target\n\nBest immediate move:\n- UP toward (1,1) is better as it:\n  * Gets me away from the bottom edge\n  * Creates more space between me and the enemy\n  * Gives me access to the (1,5) apple route\n  * Maintains more future movement options\n  * Avoids potential collision if enemy moves down\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving UP, continue moving UP to reach (1,5) apple\n- Monitor enemy movement and try to control the left side of the board\n- Avoid committing to tight spaces and maintain escape routes\n- Prioritize growth while keeping safe distance from enemy\n- Be prepared to change direction if enemy threatens my path\n\nUP",

Length: 2, Score: 1.\n\n*My last move was RIGHT, from (3, 3) to (4, 3).*\n*S0's last move must have been UP, from (1, 0) to (1, 1). (This is safe for S0, as (2, 0) was its tail, which moved to (1, 0), so (1, 0) becomes the new tail (1, 0). Moving to (1, 1) means the new body is [(1, 0)]).*\n\n**Board Snapshot (Relevant parts):**\nMy Head (H1): (4, 3)\nMy Body (B1): (3, 3)\nS0 Head (H0): (1, 1)\nS0 Body (B0): (1, 0)\n\nApples near me: (5, 3), (5, 5), (3, 5), (7, 4).\nApple (5, 3) is 1 move away (RIGHT).\nApple (5, 5) is 2 moves away (R, U or U, R).\nApple (3, 5) is 2 moves away (U, U).\n\nApples near S0: (1, 5), (4, 0), (6, 0).\nApple (1, 5) is 4 moves away (U, U, U, U).\n\n**1. S0's Possible Moves (from (1, 1)):**\n*   **UP (to (1, 2)):** Safe. Continues toward (1, 5).\n*   **DOWN (to (1, 0)):** **Deadly.** Moves backwards into its body segment (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 1)):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 1)):** Safe.\n\nS0 is likely aiming UP towards (1, 5) or LEFT/RIGHT to explore the corner. We assume S0 is smart and will go UP to claim (1, 5) or RIGHT to get into the action.\n\n**2. My Possible Moves (from (4, 3)):**\n\n*   **UP (to (4, 4)):** Safe. Moves toward (3, 5) (2 moves) or (5, 5) (2 moves).\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 2)):** Safe. Moves away from apples, toward the lower boundary.\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 3)):** **Deadly.** Backwards move into my body segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 3)):** Safe. Eats the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (Prioritize eating the apple):**\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 3)** (Eats Apple)\n*   Result: Head is at (5, 3), length increases to 3. New body: [(4, 3), (3, 3)].\n*   Safety Check:\n    *   No wall collision.\n    *   No self-collision.\n    *   S0 is at (1, 1). Even if S0 moved to (2, 1) and then (3, 1), they wouldn't reach (5, 3) this turn. No head-on collision threat.\n*   This is the optimal move as it scores a point and increases my length, making me safer.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (4, 4)**\n*   Safe, but leaves (5, 3) open to the enemy (though unlikely to be reached by S0). It delays scoring.\n\n**Strategic Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 3) is the immediate best move. It secures an apple and prepares me for navigating the central cluster of apples (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 4), etc. S0 is still confined to the bottom left quadrant.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next few turns):**\n1. Move RIGHT to (5, 3) (Eat apple, T=4).\n2. T=5: My head is at (5, 3). Target the apple at (5, 5). Move UP.\n3. T=6: Head at (5, 4). Move UP to (5, 5) (Eat apple). After this, I can pivot to (6, 6) or (5, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT to (6, 5) sets up a direct UP move next turn to eat (6, 6). This is the most efficient short-term apple gain.\n\n**4. Predict Enemy Move (S0 from (1, 4))**\n\n*   S0's body is at (1, 3).\n*   S0 is likely aiming for (1, 5) (Distance 1, UP).\n    *   Predicted S0 move: UP to (1, 5) (Eats apple). S0 Length becomes 3.\n\nSince S0 is far away and moving vertically on the left edge, there is no collision risk for Snake 1.\n\n**5.

Apples nearby: (3, 5) (R, R), (2, 9) (U, U, U, R).\n*   S0's most likely moves are:\n    1. **RIGHT (to (2, 5)):** Moves towards (3, 5).\n    2. **UP (to (1, 6)):** Moves generally North.\n    3. **DOWN (to (1, 4)):** Deadly (self-collision).\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 5), it prepares to take apple (3, 5). If S0 moves UP to (1, 6), it prepares to move North towards (2, 9).\n\nIn any case, S0 is far from H1 (distance > 5) and poses no collision threat for H1 moving to (6, 6).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nMoving UP to (6, 6) secures an apple, increases score/length advantage, and positions me well for the North/East apple cluster (e.g., (9, 8), (9, 9), (5, 8)).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next few turns):**\n1. T=8: Move UP to (6, 6) (Eat apple). Head at (6, 6). Length 5.\n2. T=9: Target (5, 8) (UP, LEFT, UP) or (7, 4) (DOWN, RIGHT). (5, 8) is 3 steps away, but (7, 4) is 2 steps away. Given the large cluster of apples North (9, 9), (9, 8), (5, 8), I should prioritize going North/East. UP to (6, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 6). (6, 7) seems best to maintain centrality and target the cluster.\n3. T=10: Move UP/LEFT/RIGHT to eat next apple.\n\nUP",

Good position for East side apples.\n\n**3. Decision Strategy for Snake 1**\n\nAll three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are good options, positioning me for various apple clusters.\n\n*   UP (6, 7): Direct path to (5, 8) and general North dominance.\n*   LEFT (5, 6): Centralizes my position, allowing easier access to (5, 8) or cutting off S0 if it moves North aggressively (unlikely).\n*   RIGHT (7, 6): Best angle for (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 9).\n\nConsidering S0 is at (2, 5) and likely targeting (3, 5), or perhaps moving North toward (2, 9), my best strategic choice is to secure the Northern apples which are further from S0.\n\nMoving **UP** to (6, 7) keeps me on the path to (5, 8) (2 steps away) and (4, 8) (3 steps away), while simultaneously opening up the path to the dense corner cluster (9, 8), (9, 9).\n\nLet's prioritize the closest apple in the preferred direction: (5, 8).\nPath UP, LEFT, UP.\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 7):\nNext turn: I can move LEFT to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 7).\n(5, 7) -> (5, 8) (Eat, 2 moves)\n(4, 8) is (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8) (3 moves)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6):\nNext turn: I can move UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6).\n(5, 7) -> (5, 8) (Eat, 2 moves)\n\nThe paths are symmetrical in terms of distance to (5, 8). Moving UP (6, 7) gives me slightly more vertical room and positions me more centrally for the North/East Apples.\n\n**4. Predict Enemy Move (S0 from (2, 5))**\n\nS0's neck is (1, 5).\nApples near S0: (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 9).\n\nS0 is highly likely to move **RIGHT** to (3, 5) and eat that apple.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 5): H0 eats apple. Length becomes 4. Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n*   If S0 moves UP to (2, 6): Targets apple (2, 9).\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (2, 4): Targets (3, 4).\n\nGiven the immediate availability of (3, 5), S0 will almost certainly take it. Since my position (6, 6) is far away, the enemy's move does not affect my safety.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMove UP to (6, 7) to continue securing the Northern apple cluster and maintain a clear advantage in position and score.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT=9: Move UP to (6, 7).\nT=10: Move UP to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 7).

Slower path to (5, 8).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 5))**\n\nS0's neck is (2, 5). S0 just ate (3, 5).\nApples near H0: (3, 4) [1 step], (7, 4) [4 steps], (6, 2) [4 steps].\n\n*   H0 is highly likely to move **DOWN** to (3, 4) to eat the next closest apple.\n    *   If H0 moves DOWN to (3, 4) (Eat): H0 becomes (3, 4). Length 5. Body: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n*   H0 could move LEFT to (2, 5) (deadly, into its own body).\n*   H0 could move RIGHT to (4, 5). This positions it well to contest central apples like (7, 4).\n*   H0 could move UP to (3, 6). Targets (6, 6) or (7, 4).\n\nThe immediate and rational target is (3, 4). This move keeps S0 far from me.\n\n**4. Decision Strategy for Snake 1**\n\nMy priority is the closest safe apple, (5, 8).\n*   **Move LEFT (to (5, 7)):** Sets up an apple capture for turn 11 at (5, 8). This is the most efficient move.\n*   **Move UP (to (6, 8)):** Also sets up the capture for turn 11 (move LEFT then to (5, 8)).\n\nMoving LEFT is slightly more aggressive and commits me to the West side of the Northern wall, which is fine since (4, 8) and (5, 8) are there, and I want to avoid crowding the East side where S0 might eventually move if it goes through the middle (e.g., towards (7, 4)).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are excellent and safe moves. Since LEFT is the first step toward the immediate capture, I will choose it.\n\n**5. Final Check for Head-on Collisions/Traps**\n\n*   My move: (5, 7).\n*   S0's predicted move: (3, 4).\n*   No collision risk. I maintain a dominant position in the North.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT=10: Move LEFT to (5, 7).\nT=11: Move UP to (5, 8) and eat the apple.\nT=12: Move LEFT to (4, 8) or UP towards (2, 9).\n\nLEFT",

It must have moved RIGHT from (3, 5) to (4, 5) to reach its current head position. This means the enemy did *not* eat the (3, 4) apple as predicted, or the (3, 4) apple was not there on turn 10. Let's re-verify the map.\n\n*   The map shows an apple at (3, 4).\n*   Snake 0 moved from (3, 5) to (4, 5). This means Snake 0 moved RIGHT, away from the (3, 4) apple. This is an unusual move unless it was positioning itself aggressively towards the center or me.\n\n**2.

Excellent.\n*   **DOWN (to (5, 6)):**\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy Collision: If H0 moves UP to (4, 6), safe. If H0 moves RIGHT to (5, 5), this is my tail segment, but it will move. My tail *is* (5, 5). If I move to (5, 6), my body segments will shift to (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5). The original tail (5, 5) will vacate. My move to (5, 6) is safe from my own body unless I move straight back, which I am not doing ((5, 5) is 2 segments away). Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to (4, 7)):**\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Positions for (4, 8) next turn. Slower than UP.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6, 7)):** Deadly. Moves into my body (neck segment).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 5))**\n\nS0's neck is (3, 5). S0 seems to prioritize central control or proximity to my snake.\nApples near H0: (3, 4) [2 steps via LEFT, DOWN], (7, 4) [4 steps via RIGHT], (6, 2) [4 steps].\n\nSafe moves for S0: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (but RIGHT leads into coordinate (5, 5), which is currently my tail, which might vacate).\n\n*   **S0 moves LEFT (to (3, 5)):** Deadly (into neck).\n*   **S0 moves RIGHT (to (5, 5)):** (5, 5) is currently my tail. If I move UP, my tail vacates (5, 5). S0 could potentially eat my tail's spot if I don't move into (5, 5) myself. This is a possibility.\n*   **S0 moves UP (to (4, 6)):** Positions for central engagement.\n*   **S0 moves DOWN (to (4, 4)):** Positions for (3, 4) or (7, 4).\n\nBecause I have an immediate capture opportunity at (5, 8), I should prioritize that. Moving UP to (5, 8) is a guaranteed safe apple capture.\n\n**4. Collision Check (H1 UP to (5, 8))**\n\nMy move: (5, 8).\nThe enemy is at (4, 5). There is no possibility of a collision.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nThe move UP to (5, 8) is highly beneficial:\n1. It guarantees an apple capture, increasing my lead (5 apples vs 3 or 4).\n2. It is absolutely safe from perimeter, self, and enemy collision.\n3. It keeps me in the fruitful Northern area where (4, 8) and (2, 9) are still viable next targets.\n\nI will move UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT=11: Move UP to (5, 8) and eat. New head H1: (5, 8).\nT=12: Target (4, 8) (LEFT) or try to push towards (2, 9) (UP, LEFT). If S0 moved to (4, 6) or (4, 4), S0 is still relatively far. I should secure (4, 8) next.\n\nUP",

Analyze Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 6))**\n\nS0 is currently positioned centrally, but slightly north-west. It is facing a segment of my body ((6, 6), (6, 7)) on its right.\n\nSafe moves for S0 (neck is (4, 5)): UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is not safe as (4, 5) is its neck. Wait, my chart is wrong.\nS0 is at (4, 6). Neck is (4, 5). S0 cannot move DOWN into (4, 5).\n\n*   **S0 moves UP (to (4, 7)):** Puts S0 closer to the top edge and apples like (2, 9).\n*   **S0 moves LEFT (to (3, 6)):** Puts S0 closer to the west wall.\n*   **S0 moves RIGHT (to (5, 6)):** This is threatening. (5, 6) is currently empty. If I move LEFT to (4, 8), my old tail (5, 5) will be removed. The enemy is encroaching on my lower body.\n\n**Collision Check (if I move LEFT to (4, 8))**\n\nMy movement path is safe from self-collision and walls.\nThe only potential head-on collision spot is (4, 7), (5, 7), (4, 9), (5, 9), etc.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (4, 7): No collision with my move to (4, 8).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (3, 6): No collision.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 6): No collision.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 8) is an immediate apple capture that is completely safe. This move solidifies my position in the north-west quadrant and increases the score lead (6 apples vs. 3).\n\n**4. Decision and Long-Term Strategy**\n\nI have a guaranteed safe apple capture at (4, 8) by moving LEFT. This is the optimal move.\n\n*   H1 next position: (4, 8). Score 6, Length 7.\n*   Next targets are (2, 9) and (9, 9)/(9, 8).\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nMy body will anchor around (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\nS0 is at (4, 6). S0 is now positioned to try and cut me off or target (3, 4).\n\nAfter securing (4, 8), a good follow-up move would be UP or LEFT to start circling towards the remaining northern apples.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (4, 8))**\n\nMy neck segment is (5, 8).\n\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 7)):**\n    *   This is an immediate head-on collision fatal risk. H0 is at (4, 7). If I move DOWN, and S0 stays or moves up, we collide head-on at (4, 7). Even if H0 moves away (LEFT or RIGHT), I take H0's current spot (4, 7). This is highly dangerous and should be avoided unless it forces a favorable outcome (which it doesn't here).\n*   **UP (to (4, 9)):**\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple: None immediately, but grants access to (2, 9), (9, 9), (8, 9).\n    *   Enemy Collision: Safe. H0 is at (4, 7).\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe, moves toward the corner apples and keeps my options open.\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 8)):**\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple: None.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe, slightly better angle for (2, 9).\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 8)):** Deadly. Moves into my body (neck segment).\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 7))**\n\nS0's neck is (4, 6). S0 is directly under my head (4, 8).\n\nSafe moves for S0: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is into the neck (4, 6).\n\n*   **S0 moves UP (to (4, 8)):** Head-on collision if I move DOWN. If I move UP or LEFT, S0 takes my current spot (4, 8).\n*   **S0 moves LEFT (to (3, 7)):** Gets closer to (3, 4).\n*   **S0 moves RIGHT (to (5, 7)):** This is moving into my body segment (5, 7). S0 will die if it moves RIGHT unless (5, 7) becomes clear, which it won't this turn since I just ate (meaning no reduction of body length unless I hit an apple again). Wait, I grew last turn, so my tail (5, 5) remains. My body segments are fixed relative to my head move.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 9): The segment (5, 8) becomes the new neck. The tail (5, 5) moves off the board.\nThe cells occupied by my snake *before the movement* are: (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\nThe cell that is freed is the tail (5, 5).\n\nLet's recheck S0 moving RIGHT to (5, 7). (5, 7) is currently my body.\n*If I move UP to (4, 9), (5, 7) remains part of my body.*\nH1 -> (4, 9)\nNew B1: (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5).\n(5, 7) will still be occupied. **If S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7), S0 dies.**\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI need to secure the northern apples and maintain my significant lead (6 vs 3). Moving UP or LEFT are the safe options.\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 9):** Positions me perfectly to strike towards (2, 9) or pivot East towards (8, 9)/(9, 9). It creates a barrier (my new head (4, 9) and old head (4, 8)) preventing S0 from easily getting into the corner (2, 9).\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 8):** Also aims for (2, 9), but is less direct for the immediate corner. It leaves (4, 9) open for S0 if S0 moves UP.\n\nIf I move UP:\nH1: (4, 9).\nS0 will likely move UP to (4, 8) to claim the prime real estate, or LEFT to (3, 7) to pursue (3, 4).\nIf S0 moves UP to (4, 8), I maintain vertical safety and block S0 from moving into the far north corner immediately.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nH1: (3, 8).\nS0 might move UP to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 7) (collision, S0 dies). If S0 moves UP, they are positioned better for (2, 9) than I am.\n\nMoving UP seems strategically superior as it claims the highest ground, puts me one step closer to the very lucrative cluster of apples along the North/East walls, and ensures maximum distance from the enemy head. It also potentially baits S0 into moving to the now-vacated (4, 8), keeping it contained vertically.\n\nLet's confirm the immediate threats one last time:\n1. Moving DOWN to (4, 7) is a suicidal head-on collision risk with H0. **Eliminated.**\n2. Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) is into my neck. **Eliminated.**\n3. UP to (4, 9) is safe.\n4. LEFT to (3, 8) is safe.\n\nChoosing UP. This establishes dominance on the top edge and allows me to proceed toward (2, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue clearing the North/East apple clusters to build an insurmountable lead and length advantage. Use my growing body to wall off the enemy, especially from the critical apple clusters. After (4, 9), aim for (2, 9) or loop East via (5, 9) towards (9, 9).\n\nUP",

(5, 9) is clear.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe, progresses toward the eastern apples.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 7))**\n\nS0's neck is (4, 7). S0 freed up (4, 5) last turn.\nSafe S0 moves: UP (to (3, 8)), DOWN (to (3, 6)), LEFT (to (2, 7)). RIGHT (to (4, 7)) is into its neck.\n\n*   S0's primary goal is likely (3, 4) or getting out of the corner I created.\n*   If S0 moves UP (to (3, 8)): S0 is heading towards the (2, 9) apple. Distance (3, 8) to (2, 9) is 2. My distance (4, 9) to (2, 9) is 2.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (to (2, 7)): S0 is moving away from the north apples.\n*   If S0 moves DOWN (to (3, 6)): S0 is heading directly towards (3, 4).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI have a strong vertical position (Y=9). The apple (2, 9) is immediately accessible, and clearing it would give me a 7-3 lead and increase my length further, making walling off S0 easier.\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (3, 9):** I secure the path to (2, 9).\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (3, 8): I am now adjacent to S0's head, but I can reach (2, 9) next turn (Move LEFT). S0 would have to move UP to (3, 9) (where my head is now) or LEFT to (2, 8). If S0 moves to (3, 8), and I move LEFT to (3, 9), S0 is boxed in that corner, which is good.\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN to (3, 6): S0 targets (3, 4). I get (2, 9) uncontested.\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (5, 9):** I give up the (2, 9) apple. S0 might move UP to (3, 8) then to (2, 8) or (3, 9), or even aim for (4, 9) if I leave it open. If S0 moves to (3, 8), they are one step away from (2, 9). If S0 moves to (4, 9) next turn, they could get it.\n\nMy primary focus must be denying S0 the northern apples and maintaining my overwhelming lead. (2, 9) is an immediate priority.\n\nLet's trace the LEFT move:\n*   H1 moves to (3, 9).\n*   If S0 moves UP to (3, 8).\n*   Next turn: H1 moves LEFT to (2, 9) (EATS APPLE). S0 would likely move to (2, 8) or (3, 9). If S0 moves to (3, 9), they hit my body (4, 8) or (5, 8) (depending on where the tail moves). Wait, my body segments are (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6). (3, 9) is clear unless I just moved there.\n\nLet's assume the optimal (and most competitive) move for S0 is UP to (3, 8) to challenge for (2, 9).\n\nTurn 14:\n1. H1: (4, 9) -> LEFT to (3, 9).\n2. H0: (3, 7) -> UP to (3, 8). (S0 is now 1 square from H1, and 1 square from the apple (2, 9)).\n\nTurn 15:\n1. H1 (at (3, 9)): Move LEFT to (2, 9) (EAT APPLE). New body segments: (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), ...\n2. H0 (at (3, 8)):\n    *   If S0 moves LEFT to (2, 8): safe, but misses the apple.\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (3, 9): S0 hits my current head position (3, 9), which becomes part of my body this turn. **S0 DIES.**\n\nThis trapping sequence is very strong. Moving LEFT guarantees the apple or kills the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving LEFT to (3, 9) is the best decision. It secures the path to the apple (2, 9) and simultaneously sets up a fatal collision for S0 if S0 continues to pursue the same apple cluster.\n\nLEFT",

Long-Term Plan (Post-Move LEFT)**\n\nAfter eating, I will be at (2, 9).\n*   The board corner (0, 9), (1, 9) is clear, but no immediate apples there.\n*   Next obvious apple is (0, 5) or (3, 4) (which S0 is targeting).\n*   I should either:\n    1.

Drop DOWN to wall off S0 or head towards the central apples (3, 4), (0, 5).\n\nIf S0 gets (3, 4) next turn, my lead remains 7-4.\nFrom (2, 9), moving DOWN to (2, 8) or (1, 9) seems prudent to maintain board control and options. I should prepare to move down the west side or loop back east along the top. Since (9, 9) and (8, 9) have apples, looping back east is highly attractive.\n\nNext turn (T=16) from (2, 9):\nI can move RIGHT (to (3, 9), which is now empty as the old head moved to (2, 9) and became body), or DOWN (to (2, 8)). Moving DOWN ensures I don't get trapped by my recently acquired large body, and enables a push towards the center or the west wall.\nI will focus on securing (9, 9) and (8, 9) after this move, perhaps by dropping down slightly (2, 8) and then looping back across (Y=8 or Y=7).\n\nFor the current turn, the choice is clear: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

S0 is perfectly positioned for the apple at (3, 4).\nSafe S0 moves: DOWN (to (3, 4)), LEFT (to (2, 5)), RIGHT (to (4, 5)). UP (to (3, 6)) is into its neck.\n\n*   S0's primary goal is (3, 4), which is an immediate apple.\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN (3, 4): Safe, eats apple. Score 4. New head (3, 4). Old tail (4, 7) remains.\n*   We must assume S0 moves DOWN.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI need to decide between moving LEFT (to (1, 9)) or DOWN (to (2, 8)).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to (1, 9)):**\n    *   Puts me far away from the action, but continues to secure the top-left corner.\n    *   I gain slightly more space and preparation for looping back or moving down the west side.\n*   **Move DOWN (to (2, 8)):**\n    *   Positions me to move towards the center/south or loop back East along Y=8.\n    *   This is crucial because there are many apples along Y=9 and Y=8 in the East (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9). If I want to capitalize on those, moving DOWN, then RIGHT (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8, which is currently my body, so I can't go here yet) might be slightly restrictive.\n\nLet's look at the body for RIGHT/EAST movement:\nB1: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. (4, 8) is occupied.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 8):\nNext turn (T=17) from (2, 8):\nPossible moves: UP (to (2, 9), empty), DOWN (to (2, 7)), LEFT (to (1, 8)), RIGHT (to (3, 8), empty).\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 8) seems good, allowing me to start dropping down the eastern side of my body segments (3, 9), (4, 9).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 9):\nNext turn (T=17) from (1, 9):\nPossible moves: UP (dead), DOWN (to (1, 8)), LEFT (to (0, 9)), RIGHT (to (2, 9), empty).\nIf I move to (0, 9), I hit the wall and could get trapped.\n\nThe goal is to move towards the large cluster of apples (9, 9), (8, 9), (9, 8). I need to navigate around my established body.\n\n1. **Option A: DOWN (2, 8)** -> (3, 8) -> (4, 7) (if S0 tail is released) or (5, 7) or (5, 6).\n2. **Option B: LEFT (1, 9)** -> (0, 9) or (1, 8). If I go (0, 9), I have to go DOWN to (0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) (apple). This is a safe route, but slow.\n\nComparing these:\nMoving DOWN to (2, 8) gives me immediate access to (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8) corridors as my body releases. My body is blocking the direct path to the East: (3, 9) and (4, 9) are currently blocking Y=9.\n\nSince I am aiming for the Eastern apples, I want to move *down* one row immediately to bypass the body segments blocking the path right.\n\n(2, 9) -> DOWN to (2, 8). Safe.\nT=17: (2, 8) -> RIGHT to (3, 8). Safe.\nT=18: (3, 8) -> RIGHT to (4, 8). (4, 8) is currently B1 (4th segment). *If I don't eat an apple in T=16 or T=17, the tail (6, 6) moves, and (4, 8) is released.*\nT=16: I don't eat. Tail (6, 6) moves to (6, 7). (Length 7).\nT=17: I don't eat. Tail (6, 7) moves to (5, 7). (Length 7).\nT=18: (4, 8) is released (becomes 5th segment, then 4th, then 3rd). Wait, B1 is length 7.\nB1 (T=15): (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6).\nB1 (T=16, after move LEFT + apple): (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6) -> (2, 9) is H1, body is (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6). Length 8. The tail (6, 6) stays.\n\nT=16 Move: DOWN to (2, 8). Length 8. Tail (6, 6) moves to (6, 7). No, that's wrong. If I don't eat, the tail *segment* disappears, and all segments shift back one position.\nH1(2, 9) -> (2, 8).\nNew B1: (2, 9) (new neck), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7). Length 8. Old T(6, 6) is gone.\n\nT=17 Move: From (2, 8). Say I move RIGHT to (3, 8). No apple. Length 8.\nNew H1: (3, 8). New B1: (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7). Old T(6, 7) is gone.\n\nT=18 Move: From (3, 8). Say I move RIGHT to (4, 8). (4, 8) is 5th segment in B1. Collision!\n\nThis means I must prioritize moving around my long body. Moving LEFT (1, 9) is safer in the short term because it moves me away from my existing body mass, setting up a clear path down the west wall towards (0, 5).\n\nLet's refine the plan:\n1. Move LEFT to (1, 9). This clears the path for my body segments to move behind me (e.g., (2, 9) becomes free for T=17).\n2. T=17: Move LEFT to (0, 9).\n3. T=18: Move DOWN to (0, 8).\n4. ... Work the west wall down towards (0, 5).\n\nAlternatively, if I want the East apples:\n1. Move DOWN to (2, 8).\n2. T=17: Move RIGHT to (3, 8).\n3. T=18: Options are DOWN (3, 7 - near S0 old tail/body) or LEFT/UP. Moving E is currently impossible until more body segments clear.\n\nIf S0 eats (3, 4), S0 will be at (3, 4), length 5. S0's new body: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7). Tail (4, 7) stays.\n\nGiven the constraints of my long body (length 8), moving away from it gives more options. The dense cluster of apples in the East (Y=9/8) is currently hard to approach without colliding with myself. The apple at (0, 5) is accessible by moving down the West wall safely.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT to (1, 9). This keeps me maximally safe from collision with my own body, uses the space I just cleared, and starts working towards the less contested West side/South side apples.\n\n**Revised Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):**\nCurrent location (2, 9). Move LEFT to (1, 9). Next, prioritize moving LEFT to (0, 9) and then down the western wall to secure (0, 5). This path avoids internal collision risk and is uncontested by S0, who is now focused on the central low apples (3, 4), (3, 2). Once (0, 5) is secured, assess if the Eastern apples (9, 9), (8, 9) are available by moving back across the lower half of the board, or if looping back across Y=8 or Y=7 is feasible.\n\nLEFT",

Thus, my length is 8, and the tail (6, 7) will move off this turn.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (3, 4). Score: 4. Length: 5. (Assumed previous move was DOWN to (3, 4) and ate apple, based on T=16 analysis and body position).\n    *   Body (B0): [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7)].\n    *   Tail segment T0: (4, 7).\n    *   H0 is currently near apples (3, 2) and (7, 4).\n*   **Apples:** (9, 8), (9, 9), (6, 0), (7, 4), (4, 0), (8, 9), (6, 2), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 3), (8, 6), (0, 5), (3, 2), (1, 3), (1, 0).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (1, 9))**\n\nMy neck segment is (2, 9).\n\n*   **UP (to (1, 10)):** Deadly. Off the board.\n*   **DOWN (to (1, 8)):** Safe.\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: (1, 8) is empty.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 9)):** Safe.\n    *   Wall/Self-collision: (0, 9) is empty.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 9)):** Deadly. Into my body (neck segment). (2, 9) is B1 (1st segment).\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 4))**\n\nS0's neck is (3, 5).\nH0 is near (3, 2) (apple, distance 2 down) and (7, 4) (apple, distance 4 right).\n\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 3)):** Safe. Moves towards (3, 2) apple.\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 4)):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 4)):** Safe.\n*   **UP (to (3, 5)):** Deadly (into neck).\n\nThe most logical move for S0 is DOWN to (3, 3), continuing the push towards (3, 2). If S0 moves DOWN:\nNew H0: (3, 3). Tail (4, 7) moves to (3, 7). New B0: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7). Length 5.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI established a plan last turn to move LEFT along the top wall and then down the west side to secure the apple at (0, 5).\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT (to (0, 9))**\n    *   Pros: Continues the strategic path, maximizes distance from my main body block (x=2, 3, 4), and secures the corner. Sets up a clear path down (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6) to (0, 5) (apple).\n    *   Cons: Still 4 moves from the apple (0, 9 -> 0, 8 -> 0, 7 -> 0, 6 -> 0, 5). S0 is moving towards apples faster.\n*   **Option B: DOWN (to (1, 8))**\n    *   Pros: Drops into the board interior. Allows future movement towards (1, 3) or back towards my clearing body mass (2, 8) is now free.\n    *   From (1, 8), I could move RIGHT to (2, 8). Then next turn perhaps (3, 8), which might still be blocked by my own body segment (4, 8) if I don't eat.\n        *   T=17: (1, 8). (6, 7) clears.\n        *   T=18: Move to (2, 8). (5, 7) clears.\n        *   T=19: Move to (3, 8). (5, 8) clears.\n        *   T=20: Move to (4, 8). (4, 8) clears. This path is still very slow to reach the eastern bulk of apples, and involves navigating a long serpentine body.\n\nThe safest, simplest plan is to stick with the clear path down the West wall, as it minimizes immediate self-collision risk and is uncontested.\n\n**(1, 9) -> LEFT to (0, 9).**\n\n*   T=18: (0, 9) -> DOWN to (0, 8).\n*   T=19: (0, 8) -> DOWN to (0, 7).\n*   T=20: (0, 7) -> DOWN to (0, 6).\n*   T=21: (0, 6) -> DOWN to (0, 5) (Apple).\n\nThis is a four-turn apple grab, but it guarantees growth and safety. Given my significant length and the difficulty of navigating it, prioritizing safety and a guaranteed meal is prudent. S0 has two nearby apples ((3, 2) and (1, 3)), and focusing on them while I secure the corner is acceptable.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMove LEFT to (0, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=18):**\nCurrent H1 at (0, 9). Continue down the west wall: DOWN to (0, 8), then (0, 7), (0, 6), aiming for the apple at (0, 5). Re-evaluate the board state after eating (0, 5).\n\nLEFT",

I need to be careful about the enemy's potential movement and avoid getting trapped\n\nBest immediate move:\n- DOWN toward (3,2) is the best move as it:\n  * Moves me to eat the (3,2) apple immediately\n  * Keeps me away from the enemy's body\n  * Maintains safe distance from enemy\n  * Gives me growth which is crucial since I'm behind in score\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving DOWN to (3,2), I'll eat the apple and grow\n- Next turn I can continue DOWN toward (3,1) or adjust based on enemy movement\n- Monitor enemy movement and be ready to adjust if they change direction\n- Continue growing while maintaining safe distance from enemy\n- Avoid getting trapped between enemy and board edges\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking collision\n\nDOWN",

Let's trace T=18:\n        *   T=18 start: H(0, 9), B[(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)].

(0, 7) is empty.\n*   **LEFT (to (-1, 8)):** Deadly. Off the board.\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 8)):** Safe. (1, 8) is empty.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 2))**\n\nS0's body is stacked vertically (3, 3) to (3, 7).\nS0 has apples nearby: (1, 3) [D=3], (4, 0) [D=2], (6, 2) [D=3], (1, 0) [D=4].\n\nS0 is in a junction position.\n*   **To (1, 3):** LEFT to (2, 2). Then LEFT to (1, 2) or UP to (2, 3). This is a strong direction to deny me (1, 3).\n*   **To (4, 0):** DOWN to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 2).\n*   **To (6, 2):** RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe safest, shortest path apple for S0 is (4, 0) via (3, 1) or perhaps aggressively towards (6, 2) or (1, 3).\n\n*   If S0 moves 1. DOWN (to (3, 1)): Safe.\n*   If S0 moves 2. LEFT (to (2, 2)): Safe.\n*   If S0 moves 3. RIGHT (to (4, 2)): Safe.\n*   If S0 moves 4. UP (to (3, 3)): Deadly. Into its own neck segment.\n\nS0 has three safe moves, all leading to apples.\n(3, 1) is 1 move towards (4, 0) (D=2) or (1, 0) (D=3).\n(2, 2) is 1 move towards (1, 3) (D=3) or (1, 0) (D=3).\n(4, 2) is 1 move towards (6, 2) (D=2).\n\nS0 favors movement that maximizes future options and apple access. (4, 2) seems relatively open. (2, 2) seems competitive towards the west side. (3, 1) is competitive towards the south. Given S0 just came down the (3, Y) column, moving to (3, 1) or (4, 2) might be strategically simple, opening up column 3 for its tail.\n\nI predict S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 2) or DOWN to (3, 1) or LEFT to (2, 2). There is no head collision risk for me regardless of S0's move, as we are far apart.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nMy primary goal is the apple at (0, 5).\n\n*   **DOWN (to (0, 7)):** This is the direct path, safe, and continues my plan to secure the western perimeter apples (0, 5).\n    *   T=20: (0, 6).\n    *   T=21: (0, 5) (Apple).\n    *   This path is unimpeded.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 8)):** This move is safe, but it moves away from the planned target (0, 5) and potentially traps me between my body chain (1, 9), (2, 9), etc., and the edge (unless I move UP, which is immediately dead on the next turn). If I move R, R, D, D... etc., it's much slower to get to any apple, and riskier due to proximity to my body segments along Y=9.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the established, safe, and effective plan is best. Move DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=20):**\nCurrent H1 at (0, 7). Continue DOWN to (0, 6), then (0, 5) (Apple). We lead in score and are securing isolated apples. Keep monitoring S0, who is now focused on the central/southern apples. Move 20 will be DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (2, 2))**\n\nS0's body is [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)].\n\nS0 is extremely close to the apple at (1, 3).\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1. **UP (to (2, 3)):** Moves towards (1, 3). Safe.\n2. **LEFT (to (1, 2)):** Moves towards (1, 3) and (1, 0). Safe.\n3. **DOWN (to (2, 1)):** Moves towards (1, 0). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to (3, 2)):** Deadly. Into its neck segment.\n\nS0 will likely prioritize (1, 3), meaning UP (to (2, 3)) or LEFT (to (1, 2)).\nIf S0 moves UP (2, 3), it is 1 move from apple (1, 3).\nIf S0 moves LEFT (1, 2), it is 1 move from apple (1, 3) OR (1, 0) (also 1 move away). (1, 3) via (1, 2) is a diagonal move, but S0 will likely aim for (1, 3) because it offers more flexibility (near my body segments).\n\nGiven the proximity of (1, 3), S0 is most likely moving LEFT to (1, 2) or UP to (2, 3).\nMy move (0, 7) is nowhere near S0's potential moves, so no head collision risk.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI am 2 moves from the apple at (0, 5). This apple is isolated and crucial for maintaining my lead and growing my length.\n\n*   **DOWN (to (0, 6)):** Continues the path directly to (0, 5). Safe, efficient.\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 7)):** Moves away from the target apple and brings me closer to the dense column of my body segments (Y=9). This is counterproductive.\n\nThe consistent and safe choice is DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=21):**\nH1 will be at (0, 6). Next move is DOWN to (0, 5) to eat the apple. This secures the far Western route. After eating, I will need to decide whether to continue South (towards (1, 0) or (9, 0)) or move East along row Y=5, navigating around column X=3 which S0 controls. My length will grow to 9, making flexibility important.\n\nDOWN",

Into its neck segment.\n\nS0 is almost certainly moving UP to (1, 3) to eat an apple. There is no head-on collision risk with my planned move.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nThe move DOWN to (0, 5) secures an apple, increasing my score to 8 and my length to 9. This is the optimal move.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=22):**\nH1 will be at (0, 5) and will have eaten.

Continue DOWN towards (0, 4) or (0, 3). (1, 0) is a close target.\n2. Move RIGHT towards (1, 5).\n\nSince I am now long and hugged the Western wall, moving slightly inward (RIGHT) to open up the board might be wise, but (1, 0) is a very close apple prize.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 4), I get closer to (1, 0) (distance 4 path: (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) OR (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> ...).\n\nS0 at (1, 3) is now blocking the route to (1, 0) somewhat, but (1, 0) is still 3 moves away for S0 (e.g., (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0)).\n\nI will prioritize getting to (1, 0) next turn, which means moving DOWN again to (0, 4) or RIGHT to (1, 5) and then maneuvering.\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 4): This is safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is open. This maintains distance from S0 and gives me maneuvering room.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate task: secure the apple.\n\nDOWN",

Empty space.\n*   **LEFT (to (-1, 5)):** Deadly. Off the board.\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 5)):** Safe. Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (1, 3))**\n\nS0's body is [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]. The enemy is currently positioned to move further into the lower quadrants.\n\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1. **UP (to (1, 4)):** Safe. Empty space.\n2. **LEFT (to (0, 3)):** Safe. Empty space.\n3. **DOWN (to (1, 2)):** Deadly. Into its neck segment (1, 2).\n4. **RIGHT (to (2, 3)):** Safe. Empty space.\n\nS0 is extremely well-positioned to go for the apple at (1, 0) or to expand toward (6, 2).\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (0, 3): It positions for (0, 2) -> (0, 1) to get the apple (0, 1), or continues to (0, 0) and then (1, 0).\n*   If S0 moves UP (1, 4): It moves toward the center, possibly aiming for (7, 4) or expanding to the right.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT (2, 3): It moves toward the center and potentially (6, 2).\n\nS0 is 3 moves from (1, 0).\nI am 5 moves from (1, 0) (e.g., (0, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 3) X BLOCKED by S0, or (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) A -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) A).\n\nThe apple (0, 1) is 4 moves for me: (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1).\nThe apple (0, 1) is 2 moves for S0 if it moves LEFT: (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1) (3 moves minimum: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1)).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nI have two safe options: DOWN (0, 4) or RIGHT (1, 5).\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (0, 4)**\n    *   Pros: Continues down the wall, aiming for the cluster of apples at the bottom (0, 1), (1, 0). This is a very tight area.\n    *   Cons: If S0 moves LEFT to (0, 3), we are potentially competing for (0, 1) and (1, 0) in the immediate future. If S0 continues to move down the 0-column, I get trapped below S0's body.\n\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (1, 5)**\n    *   Pros: Gives me space to maneuver and expands my territorial claim away from the enemy's current position near (1, 3). It prepares me to attack the entire lower-right quadrant of the board.\n    *   Cons: Slightly less direct route to the very close apples (0, 1) and (1, 0).\n\nLet's look at the proximity of (0, 1) and (1, 0).\nIf I go DOWN: (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (EAT) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) (EAT). (5 moves to get first apple A(0,1)).\nIf S0 goes LEFT: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (EAT). (3 moves to get A(0,1)).\nS0 gets A(0, 1) before me if it targets it.\n\nIf S0 targets (0, 1), it will move (0, 3). If I move DOWN, I move to (0, 4). This is safe. The next turn (T=23), S0 will be at (0, 2) (or (0, 3) if it didn't eat). I will be at (0, 4). My target (0, 1) will be unreachable if S0 gets there first.\n\nI must pivot away from S0's likely target zone or try to cut him off.\nIf S0 goes for (0, 1), I should pivot RIGHT and look to secure the path toward (7, 4) and (6, 7), or the high-wall apples (8, 6), (9, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 5):\n1. No immediate collision risk.\n2. If S0 goes LEFT (0, 3), it commits to the wall, leaving the center open for me.\n3. If S0 goes UP (1, 4) or RIGHT (2, 3), we maintain space.\n4. From (1, 5), I have many options: (2, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6). (1, 4) leads to congestion with S0's likely path (if S0 goes up).\n\nGiven that S0 has a significant advantage to secure (0, 1) and potentially (1, 0), my immediate objective should be to maximize score elsewhere and preserve maneuverability. Moving RIGHT is the better strategic choice. It expands my influence and prevents me from getting boxed into the corner by S0's growing body.\n\nLet's verify collision risk if S0 moves UP to (1, 4) and I move RIGHT to (1, 5).\nH1 -> (1, 5). S0 -> (1, 4). No collision.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 4):\nH1 -> (0, 4). If S0 moves LEFT to (0, 3), safe.\n\nI choose RIGHT (1, 5) to claim space and pivot toward the Eastern half, away from S0's current density.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=23):**\nH1 will be at (1, 5). My body is long, stretching across the top wall.\nS0 is likely maneuvering in the (0, 3) / (1, 4) / (2, 3) area.\nFrom (1, 5), I can move:\n1. UP (1, 6).\n2. RIGHT (2, 5).\n3. DOWN (1, 4). (Risk of collision with S0 if it moves UP to 1, 4, but S0 will likely avoid going into the body segment (1, 2) if it moved there T=21, so (1, 4) looks safe for S0 movement now).\n\nThe apple at (7, 4) is 6 moves away from (1, 5). The apple at (6, 7) is 7 moves away. The apple at (8, 6) is 8 moves away.\n\nMy goal for T=23 will be to move RIGHT again to (2, 5) or UP to (1, 6) to hug the wall inward briefly, then RIGHT towards the center. The core strategy is to secure the upper-right section of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Moves across the board center.\n\nS0 is extremely close to the lower apples (0, 1) and (1, 0).\nFrom (1, 4):\n*   To (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (Apple A: 4 moves)\n*   To (2, 4) -> (3, 4) (clearing) -> (4, 4) ... -> (7, 4) (Apple A: Distance 6)\n\nS0 has strong incentive for LEFT (0, 4) or UP (1, 5) to claim space.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1**\n\nMy goal from my last move (moving RIGHT to (1, 5)) was to pivot away from the bottom-left congestion and secure the East side.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (1, 6)**\n    *   Pros: Continues the movement parallel to my existing long body on the top wall (x=0 column), securing the boundary area. Leads toward (6, 7), (8, 6).\n    *   Cons: My long body is already densely packed in the upper-left corner, making movement constrained further up.\n\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (2, 5)**\n    *   Pros: Continues movement into open space towards the center and the large cluster of apples along the right wall (x=9). This maintains flexibility.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the immediate (6, 7) region compared to moving UP.\n\nLet's look at the density created by S1 in the (0, Y) and (X, 9) areas.\n(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9).\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 6):\nNext turn, I can move (2, 6) or (1, 7). (1, 7) is adjacent to my body (0, 7). (2, 6) is very good.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 5):\nNext turn, I can move (3, 5) (S0's former tail spot, now empty) or (2, 6). (2, 6) is slightly more direct to the (6, 7) apple. (3, 5) is open and gives me access to the lower-center.\n\nConsidering the enemy S0 is likely moving LEFT (0, 4) or UP (1, 5):\n\n1.  **If S0 moves LEFT to (0, 4):** S0 commits further to the bottom wall. (1, 5) is safe for me for RIGHT/UP.\n2.  **If S0 moves UP to (1, 5):** Head-on collision if I move DOWN. If I move UP or RIGHT, S0 captures (1, 5), blocking my access to the upper wall boundary through (1, 5) if I wanted to come back later.\n\nSince I aim for the eastern side of the board where clusters of high-value apples are:\n(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 3), (8, 6), (9, 0).\n\nMoving RIGHT (2, 5) keeps me open to attack those apples via (3, 5), (4, 5) down towards (7, 4), or (2, 6), (3, 6) up towards (8, 6). Furthermore, (3, 5) is S0's old tail position (3, 4) is the current tail position, which would vacate, making (3, 4) available. (3, 5) is currently empty space.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 5) seems more proactive in claiming open territory and separating myself from S0, which is still quite confined to the x=0/1/2 columns.\n\nLet's assume S0 goes UP to (1, 5).\nH1 -> (2, 5). H0 -> (1, 5). Safe.\n\nLet's assume S0 goes LEFT to (0, 4).\nH1 -> (2, 5). H0 -> (0, 4). Safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT offers the most flexibility and direction toward the bulk of the remaining apples.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=24):**\nH1 will be at (2, 5). S0 will likely be at (1, 5) or (0, 4). My focus must be to push further East, establishing a long path toward the (9, X) columns. Next moves will be (3, 5) or (2, 6). (3, 5) connects to the center/bottom, (2, 6) connects to the upper area. Given S0 is low, staying mid-to-high is wise. (2, 6) looks appealing to start claiming the center/upper-right.\n\nRIGHT\n```json\n(1, 4) is S0 head, (1, 5) is S1 head.\nS1 safe moves: UP (1, 6), RIGHT (2, 5).\nS0 potential moves: UP (1, 5) - highly likely as it's a good blocking move and keeps it centralized, LEFT (0, 4).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (2, 5):\n  If S0 moves UP (1, 5): Both safe. S0 takes my last spot.\n  If S0 moves LEFT (0, 4): Both safe. S0 chases bottom apples.\n\nIf S1 moves UP (1, 6):\n  If S0 moves UP (1, 5): Both safe. S0 takes my spot.\n  If S0 moves LEFT (0, 4): Both safe. S0 chases bottom apples.\n\nRight (2, 5) opens up the critical (3, 5) and (3, 4) area (S0's tail position will clear (3, 4)), allowing faster expansion East and South-East, which is where the bulk of the score is. I prioritize this over hugging the wall with UP (1, 6).\n```\nRIGHT",

Too risky.\n    *   *Self-Correction: Can I move into (2, 4)? No, H0 is there now. Even if H0 moves, if H0 moves into (3, 4) or (1, 4), I might collide with H0's neck at (1, 4) if H0 moves LEFT.* (2, 4) is currently H0's head, which means I cannot move there.\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 5)):** Safe. Empty space. Moves toward eastern apples.\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (2, 4))**\n\nS0's neck is (1, 4). T0 is (3, 3), which will vacate.\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (2, 5)):** Head-on collision risk with H1 if I move DOWN (I can't). This moves S0 into my current H1 spot.\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 3)):** Safe. Moves toward (6, 2), (6, 0), (4, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 4)):** Deadly. Into its neck segment.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 4)):** Safe. Moves into open space, near its former tail (3, 3) which is clearing. Leads to (7, 4).\n\nS0 is likely aiming for maximum expansion or the cluster of apples below: (6, 2), (4, 0), (6, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1).\nRight (3, 4) and DOWN (2, 3) are strong contenders for S0. UP (2, 5) forces contention with me.\n\n*   If H0 moves UP (2, 5): Head-on collision if I move DOWN (I can't). If I move UP or RIGHT, both safe. S0 takes my last spot.\n*   If H0 moves RIGHT (3, 4): Safe for me for both UP and RIGHT. (3, 4) is now open, (3, 5) remains open.\n*   If H0 moves DOWN (2, 3): Safe for me for both UP and RIGHT.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (H1 at (2, 5))**\n\nMy overall strategy is to expand East to claim the high-value apples on the right side of the board and to prevent S0 from reaching open space easily.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (2, 6)**\n    *   Pros: Keeps me high, moving towards (6, 7) and (8, 6). If S0 moves RIGHT, I maintain vertical separation. (2, 6) allows me to go (3, 6) next, or (1, 6).\n    *   Cons: My tail is currently at (2, 9). Moving up parallels my body column (x=1) and (x=0), keeping me somewhat channeled near the left wall.\n\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (3, 5)**\n    *   Pros: Directly pushes into open territory, preparing for a path towards the center/right. (3, 5) offers maximum flexibility: (4, 5) (East), (3, 6) (North), or even (3, 4) (South, which will be open if S0 moves to (3, 4) or (2, 3)).\n    *   Cons: If S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 4), S0 is now directly South of me. If S0 moves UP to (2, 5), S0 is directly West of me, blocking retreat.\n\nLet's prioritize claiming central control and distance from the tight area S0 is operating in. (3, 5) is the key to the middle of the board.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5):\n1. If H0 moves RIGHT (3, 4): S0 expands South-East. I am safe at (3, 5). Next turn, I can move (4, 5) or (3, 6) or (2, 5) (S0's old spot). My goal remains East. (4, 5) is a great move.\n2. If H0 moves UP (2, 5): S0 takes my old spot. I am safe at (3, 5). Next turn, I face S0 across the column line (x=2/x=3). I can move (4, 5) or (3, 6).\n3. If H0 moves DOWN (2, 3): I am expanding into the center while S0 focuses South.\n\nMoving RIGHT maintains my priority of reaching the East side. It establishes a strong forward boundary in the X direction.\n\nComparing (2, 6) and (3, 5):\n(2, 6) keeps me close to where S0 might want to intercept me by going via (2, 5). (3, 5) creates clean separation and opens up the horizontal path.\n\nI choose RIGHT (3, 5).\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=25):**\nH1 will be at (3, 5). S0 will likely be at (3, 4) or (2, 5). Focus T=25 is to continue East to (4, 5) to claim the open central horizontal axis, or slightly North-East to (3, 6) if the path seems clearer towards (8, 6). I must watch (7, 4) apple. (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) (Apple). If S0 goes to (3, 4), I'll push East further to outrace them to the center apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (3, 5))**\n\nMy neck is (2, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 6)):** Safe. Moving towards (8, 6), (9, 6).\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 4)):** Safe. Empty space. Moves close to H0's neck (2, 4) and the central apple (7, 4).\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 5)):** Safe. Empty space. Best path for expansion towards the right side.\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (2, 3))**\n\nS0's neck is (2, 4). T0 vacates (3, 2).\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (2, 4)):** Deadly. Into its own neck.\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 2)):** Deadly. Into its own body.\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 3)):** Deadly. Into its body.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 3)):** Safe. Moves right, into open space.\n5.  **RIGHT (to (3, 2) - not possible as (3, 2) is the tail, S0's length is 7, the tail will vacate):** T0 is at (3, 2). If S0 moves to (3, 3), it expands.\n\nWait, S0's body is [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)].\nH0 is at (2, 3).\nS0 cannot move to (2, 4) (neck), (1, 3) (body), (2, 2) (body).\nS0 can move:\n*   **UP (to (2, 4)):** No, that's the neck.\n*   **DOWN (to (2, 2)):** No, that's body.\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 3)):** No, that's body.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 3)):** Safe. Empty space. This seems the most logical expansion path for H0, heading towards the open space and apples (6, 2), (7, 4).\n\nLet's carefully verify the enemy body positions from the board state:\n(2, 4): Body\n(1, 4): Body\n(1, 3): Body\n(1, 2): Body\n(2, 2): Body\n(3, 2): Body (Tail, T0, will vacate)\n\nH0 at (2, 3).\n1. UP (2, 4): Self-collision (neck). NO.\n2. DOWN (2, 2): Self-collision (body). NO.\n3. LEFT (1, 3): Self-collision (body). NO.\n4. RIGHT (3, 3): Safe. Open space.\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained and effectively forced to move RIGHT to (3, 3).\n\n**4. Considering Collision Risk (H1 vs H0)**\n\nH1 is at (3, 5). H0 is at (2, 3). They are far enough apart that a head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n*   If H0 moves to (3, 3).\n*   H1 options: (3, 6), (3, 4), (4, 5).\n\n**5. Strategic Decision for Snake 1 (H1 at (3, 5))**\n\nI recently moved RIGHT to gain central control. I should continue expanding East to secure the high-value apple cluster along the right wall.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (3, 6):** Moves towards the corner apples (A at 9, 8; 9, 9; 8, 9; 8, 6; 9, 6). This is a good direction.\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (3, 4):** This brings me directly above where S0 will land ((3, 3) likely). While (3, 4) is open, this might create immediate pressure next turn, potentially allowing S0 to block my path or forcing me into a conflict zone. It brings me closer to the (7, 4) apple.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (4, 5):** This is the direct horizontal breakout move. It allows easy access to (7, 4) via (5, 5) and (6, 5) / (7, 5) or direct access to the East wall cluster via (4, 6) / (5, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves to (3, 3), they are focusing on the south-east quadrant. I should move RIGHT to (4, 5) to solidify my control over the horizontal center axis and race them to (7, 4). (4, 5) leads to maximum freedom.\n\nLet's evaluate the future based on RIGHT (4, 5):\nH1 at (4, 5). H0 at (3, 3).\nNext turn (T=26), H1 can move (5, 5) (East), (4, 6) (North), (4, 4) (South). High flexibility.\nIf H1 goes UP (3, 6):\nH1 at (3, 6). H0 at (3, 3).\nNext turn, H1 can move (4, 6) (East) or (3, 7) (North) or (2, 6) (West/retreat). Also flexible, but sacrifices the favorable geometry of (4, 5).\n\n(4, 5) is the most proactive move to claim the center and reach (7, 4). It avoids immediate vertical confrontation with the constrained enemy snake below.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=26):**\nH1 will be at (4, 5). H0 will be at (3, 3). My focus is securing the center path to the right side (potentially via (7, 4)) and preventing S0 from expanding vertically or horizontally into my space. Next move will be (5, 5) or (4, 6) depending on the most efficient apple route and S0's T=26 move.\n\nRIGHT",

Excellent path towards the cluster of apples/freedom to the NE.\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 4)):** Safe. Empty space. Leads towards the (7, 4) apple. Puts me closer to H0's current location (3, 3).\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 5)):** Safe. Empty space. Excellent path towards (7, 4) and the East wall.\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 3))**\n\nS0's neck is (2, 3). T0 vacates (2, 2).\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (3, 4)):** Safe. Open space. Highly likely, allows expansion.\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 2)):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards (6, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 3)):** Deadly. Into its neck segment.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 3)):** Safe. Open space. Allows expansion horizontally.\n\nS0 has three good options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). S0 needs to choose an expansion path. Given the central location, UP (3, 4) or RIGHT (4, 3) are the most strategically valuable for controlling the board center. DOWN (3, 2) is also good for reaching (6, 2).\n\n**4. Collision Risk and Decision Strategy**\n\nH1 is at (4, 5). H0 is at (3, 3).\n\n*   **If H1 moves DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   If H0 moves UP to (3, 4): No collision. They are adjacent. H1 is above H0.\n    *   If H0 moves RIGHT to (4, 3): No collision. H1 is above H0.\n    *   If H0 moves DOWN to (3, 2): No collision.\n    (4, 4) is safe and good for reaching the (7, 4) apple.\n\n*   **If H1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   This is the cleanest route to the East side and the (7, 4) apple (via (6, 5)). S0 cannot intercept this far East.\n\n*   **If H1 moves UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   Safe. Excellent route around the S0 sphere of influence, setting up for (6, 7) and the NE corner.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move:**\n\nMy snake is currently longer (9 segments vs 7 segments) and has the apple lead (8 vs 6). I need to secure the next available apples without conflict.\n\n1.  **Apples of Interest:** (7, 4) is close. (6, 7) is also close.\n2.  **Conflict Avoidance:** S0 is likely moving UP to (3, 4) or RIGHT to (4, 3). If S0 moves to (3, 4), they will put pressure on the center.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN to (4, 4):** I directly challenge S0's vertical expansion to (3, 4) or (4, 3) in subsequent turns. This is potentially aggressive, but secures a good central position for (7, 4).\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (5, 5):** This moves me away from S0's current positions, secures the right flank, and allows a direct charge towards (7, 4) via (6, 5) or (5, 4)/(6, 4). This move maintains maximum freedom.\n*   If I move **UP to (4, 6):** This moves me into the less populated northern quadrant, aiming for (6, 7) and the profitable NE corner. This is a very safe and lucrative path.\n\nGiven the density of apples on the right wall (9, X, 8, X), maintaining my strong horizontal position using **RIGHT (5, 5)** seems the most efficient way to maximize score quickly, especially targeting (7, 4) next.\n\nLet's compare (5, 5) vs (4, 6).\n(5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) / (6, 4) -> (7, 4) (Apple).\n(4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (Apple).\n\nBoth are good. (5, 5) gets me closer to the center of the board and provides options for (7, 4) or flanking S0 from the right. (4, 6) is slightly safer geographically as it pulls far away from S0.\n\nI prioritize the fastest pathway to the immediate cluster, which is East. By moving RIGHT to (5, 5), I maintain the direct threat to (7, 4), potentially making S0 pivot away from that direction toward the lower quadrant (6, 2) or the far left.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=27):**\nH1 will be at (5, 5). H0 likely at (3, 4) or (4, 3). My priority is to secure (7, 4) next turn via (6, 5) or (6, 4), or continue East to assert dominance on the right side.\n\nRIGHT",

Targets (7, 4) and East side apples.\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (3, 4))**\n\nS0's neck is (3, 3). T0 vacates (1, 2).\n\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (3, 5)):** Deadly. Into my body segment (3, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 3)):** Deadly. Into its neck segment.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 4)):** Deadly. Into its body segment (2, 4).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 4)):** Safe. Open space. This is S0's only safe move.\n\n*Crucial Insight:* Snake 0 at (3, 4) is highly constrained by Snake 1's long body wall (T T T T T T...) on the left and the surrounding body segments. Moving UP is blocked by me (3, 5). Moving LEFT is blocked by its own body (2, 4). Moving DOWN is blocked by its neck (3, 3). S0 *must* move RIGHT to (4, 4).\n\n**4. Collision Risk and Decision Strategy**\n\nWe established that S0 will move to (4, 4). H1 is at (5, 5).\n\nH1 moves:\n*   **UP (to (5, 6)):** No collision. H1 is safe.\n*   **DOWN (to (5, 4)):** No collision. H1 is adjacent to H0 at (4, 4).\n*   **RIGHT (to (6, 5)):** No collision. H1 is safe.\n\nAll three safe moves remain safe regarding S0's forced move to (4, 4).\n\n**5. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (5, 5))**\n\nS0 is moving to (4, 4), which is 2 squares away from the (7, 4) apple. H0 is now positioned to press for the center.\n\nAvailable apples: (7, 4), (6, 7), (6, 2).\n\n*   **Option UP (to (5, 6)):**\n    *   Leads directly toward the (6, 7) apple. (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7/7, 7). Good vertical expansion. Less competitive with S0.\n\n*   **Option DOWN (to (5, 4)):**\n    *   Puts me adjacent to S0 at (4, 4). Prepares for (6, 4) or (5, 3). It is not the most direct path to (7, 4), but sets up a good blocking position if S0 tries to move East.\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (to (6, 5)):**\n    *   This is the best move to claim the right quadrant and prepare for the (7, 4) apple (via (6, 4) or (7, 5)). I am currently longer and have a score lead. I should use my length and position to secure territory and apples sequentially.\n    *   From (6, 5), I have strong options: RIGHT to (7, 5) or DOWN to (6, 4) (closer to (7, 4)).\n\nChoosing RIGHT takes me further away from S0 and closer to the main cluster of high-value apples ((9, X) and (8, X) cluster), while also positioning me for (7, 4).\n\nI choose RIGHT to maximize score potential and maintain eastern control.\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=28):**\nH1 will be at (6, 5). H0 will be at (4, 4). My priority is to secure (7, 4) (via (6, 4) or (7, 5)) or pivot to (8, 6) if (7, 4) becomes too contested. S0 is now boxed in the center-south, highly exposed to the left wall, but still has reach for (6, 2) or (4, 0). I must stay on the attack along the resource-rich Eastern edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Targets (7, 4). This move is 2 steps from (7, 4).\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 5)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (7, 4) and East side apples. This move is 1 step from (7, 4) or 2 steps from (8, 6).\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 4))**\n\nS0's neck is (3, 4). T0 vacates (1, 3).\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (4, 5)):** Deadly, hits my body segment (4, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 3)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (4, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 4)):** Deadly, hits its neck segment.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 4)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (6, 2), (7, 4).\n\nS0's two best options are DOWN to (4, 3) (to chase (4, 0) or get away from H1) or RIGHT to (5, 4) (to compete for (7, 4)). Since S0 is much shorter, moving towards a closer available apple like (4, 0) is a reasonable option, or attempting to block/compete with me on the east side (5, 4).\n\nIf S0 goes RIGHT (5, 4):\n*   H1 moving DOWN (6, 4) means (6, 4) is occupied. S0 at (5, 4) is safe.\n*   H1 moving UP (6, 6) means S0 at (5, 4) is safe.\n*   H1 moving RIGHT (7, 5) means S0 at (5, 4) is safe.\n\nIf S0 goes DOWN (4, 3):\n*   H1 moving DOWN (6, 4) means S0 at (4, 3) is further away. Safe.\n*   H1 moving UP (6, 6) means S0 at (4, 3) is safe.\n*   H1 moving RIGHT (7, 5) means S0 at (4, 3) is safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk exists, regardless of S0's move.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (6, 5))**\n\nI am positioned perfectly to claim the cluster of apples on the East side (y=4, y=6, y=8, y=9). The apple (7, 4) is the closest high-value target.\n\n*   **Option UP (to (6, 6)):** Targets (6, 7). Good vertical expansion, but less critical than the southern apple (7, 4).\n*   **Option DOWN (to (6, 4)):** Direct path towards (7, 4). This move puts me 1 step closer to the apple (7, 4) than moving RIGHT and then DOWN. It also allows me to block S0 if S0 moved to (5, 4). If I get (6, 4), S0 at (5, 4) has a harder time reaching (7, 4).\n*   **Option RIGHT (to (7, 5)):** Also leads toward (7, 4). Less direct path (needs to move DOWN to (7, 4) next turn), but gives strong control over the center-east/right quadrants. It sets up excellent maneuverability for the highly dense upper-right apples. If I go to (7, 5), S0 could try to slip in at (6, 4) or (5, 4).\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs. RIGHT to secure (7, 4):**\n1.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7, 4) (apple).\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Next turn, I can move DOWN to (7, 4) (apple).\n\nThey are equally fast paths to the same apple (7, 4).\n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (6, 4) is physically closer to S0 (if S0 goes to (5, 4)) and is more aggressive in blocking S0 from a potential shortcut to the apple field. Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) maintains a safer distance and opens up for the abundant apple cluster along X=8/9.\n\nGiven my length advantage and score lead, securing territory is beneficial. The cluster of apples is extremely valuable. Moving to (7, 5) gives better options for further expansion UP/DOWN/RIGHT in the apple-rich Eastern half (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 6), etc.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5):\n*   If S0 moves DOWN (4, 3), I take (7, 4) next turn, then target (8, 6) or (9, 6).\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT (5, 4), next turn S0 targets (6, 4). I still get (7, 4). S0 is then trapped somewhat between my body and the far side.\n\nI prioritize expanding eastward and upward to capitalize on the massive apple cluster (9,y and 8,y). Moving RIGHT (to 7, 5) is the key gateway to this region.\n\nI elect to move RIGHT to (7, 5), securing the eastern territory and setting up for the (7, 4) apple next turn.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=29):**\nH1 will be at (7, 5). H0 is likely at (4, 3) or (5, 4). Next turn, take (7, 4) (Apple). Then target (8, 6) or the highly dense (9, X) region. Maintaining eastern control is paramount.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (7, 5))**\n\nMy neck is (6, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 6)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (6, 7).\n*   **DOWN (to (7, 4)):** Safe. Moves onto Apple (7, 4). Excellent move.\n*   **LEFT (to (6, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (8, 5)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (8, 6), (9, 5).\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 3))**\n\nS0's neck is (4, 4). T0 vacates (1, 4). S0 is currently targeting (4, 0) or potentially (6, 2).\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (4, 4)):** Deadly, into its own neck segment.\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 2)):** Safe. Direct path to (4, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 3)):** Safe. Into its own body segment (3, 3) **will be safe** because (3, 3) is its second segment, and since it is not eating, the current tail (1, 4) will vacate, creating space. No, wait. S0's body is [(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4)]. If S0 moves to (3, 3), it hits its 3rd segment. **This is deadly.** Moving into any body segment other than the moving tail is deadly if not eating.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 3)):** Safe. Open space. Targets (6, 2).\n\nS0 must choose between DOWN (towards 4, 0) or RIGHT (towards 6, 2). Both are good apples. Since I am highly concentrated on the East side, S0 likely continues its path away from me towards (4, 0) or attempts to flank me via (5, 3). DOWN to (4, 2) seems most direct for S0.\n\nImmediate collision risk: H1 is at (7, 5). H0 is at (4, 3). They are far apart, no risk of head-on collision.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (7, 5))**\n\nThe move DOWN to (7, 4) is an automatic apple collision and growth. This is the optimal move.\n\n*   By moving DOWN to (7, 4), I eat an apple, increase my lead (9 vs 6), and grow in length (12 segments).\n*   My new head position (7, 4) is central to the Eastern apple cluster:\n    *   (6, 7) is 3 steps away (UP, UP, LEFT).\n    *   (8, 6) is 3 steps away (RIGHT, UP, UP).\n    *   (6, 2) is 2 steps away (DOWN, LEFT).\n    *   The rich field (9, X) is one move RIGHT (to 8, 4) and then up or down.\n\nThis move is safe, productive, and maintains excellent positional advantage.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=30 onwards):**\nH1 will be at (7, 4) after eating. H0 is likely moving South or marginally East.\nPriority is to secure the upper-right quadrant. From (7, 4), evaluate (8, 6) vs (6, 7) vs (6, 2). Since (6, 2) is very easily reachable and relatively far from H0, moving towards (6, 2) or (8, 6) (for high-density X=8/9 region) is preferred.\n\nLet's look at (8, 6). If I move RIGHT (8, 4), I can access (8, 6) in two more moves. This will be the gateway to the upper-right corner.\n\nTarget for T=30: Eat (7, 4).\nTarget for T=31: Move RIGHT (8, 4) or UP (7, 6) to position for (8, 6).\n\nIf H0 goes to (4, 2) for (4, 0), it is largely out of the way for now.\n\nDOWN",

Direct route towards (4, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 2)):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 2)):** Safe. Open space. Direct route towards (6, 2).\n\nS0 is likely aiming for (4, 0) or (6, 2). Moving DOWN to (4, 1) seems strategically simple. Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) aims for the nearest apple (6, 2) which is uncontested by me currently.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 2), they are 1 step from (6, 2).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (4, 1), they are 1 step from (4, 0).\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (7, 4))**\n\nI need to consolidate my control over the East side, especially the high-value cluster at X=8 and X=9.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to (8, 4)):**\n    *   Puts me immediately adjacent to the cluster.\n    *   (8, 6) is 2 moves away (UP, UP).\n    *   (9, 3) is 2 moves away (DOWN, RIGHT).\n    *   (9, 5) is 2 moves away (UP, RIGHT).\n    *   This move maximizes access to the rich apple field (X=8, X=9).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to (6, 4)):**\n    *   Puts me closer to the center, potentially blocking S0, but S0 is currently far South.\n    *   (6, 2) is 2 moves away (DOWN, DOWN). This apple might be contested by S0 if S0 moves quickly RIGHT.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to (7, 3)):**\n    *   Leads towards (9, 3) but keeps me slightly less flexible than RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 4) is the highest value positional move. It maintains safety and guarantees access to several apples far from S0.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy move: (7, 4) -> (8, 4).\nS0 is far away at (4, 2). No collision risk.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=31 onwards):**\nH1 will be at (8, 4).\nFrom there, the priority targets are (8, 6) or the X=9 column. Since (8, 6) gives good height to access (9, 8) and (9, 9), I will prioritize reaching (8, 6) next turn, likely via UP to (8, 5).\n\nIf S0 goes for (4, 0) or (6, 2), I will secure the Northeast. I have a 3 apple lead (9 vs 6), so consolidating apples is key.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (8, 4))**\n\nMy neck is (7, 4).\n\n*   **UP (to (8, 5)):** Safe. Leads directly towards (8, 6) and (9, 5). Excellent move.\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 3)):** Safe. Leads towards (9, 3). Good move.\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 4)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 4)):** Safe. Leads towards (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6). Excellent positioning.\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 1))**\n\nS0's neck is (4, 2). T0 vacates (2, 3). S0 is 1 step from (4, 0).\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (4, 2)):** Deadly, into neck.\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 0)):** EATS an apple! Highly likely.\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 1)):** Safe. Retreat or pathing towards (1, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 1)):** Safe. Open space.\n\nS0 will almost certainly move DOWN to (4, 0) and eat. If S0 eats, their body lengthens, and (2, 3) remains occupied.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (8, 4))**\n\nMy primary goal is to secure the East (X=8, X=9) apple cluster, especially since S0 is busy far South and West. I have a 3 apple lead; growth is paramount.\n\n*   **Move UP (to (8, 5)):**\n    *   This is a strong move. It puts me 1 step from (8, 6) and keeps options open for (9, 5).\n*   **Move RIGHT (to (9, 4)):**\n    *   This is equally strong. It puts me into the X=9 column, 1 step from (9, 3) or (9, 5). It slightly restricts vertical movement compared to (8, 5) due to the dense X=9 column.\n    *   If I go (9, 4), and then UP (9, 5, eat), I am very well positioned.\n\nLet's compare UP to (8, 5) and RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\nFrom (8, 5):\n1.  Eat (8, 6) next turn (UP). Then continue to (8, 7) or (9, 6).\n2.  Go to (9, 5) next turn (RIGHT). Eat.\n\nFrom (9, 4):\n1.  Eat (9, 5) next turn (UP). Then continue to (9, 6).\n2.  Eat (9, 3) next turn (DOWN). Then continue to (9, 0).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 4) seems slightly more direct to the highest density part of the board, allowing immediate access to two apples next turn [(9, 3) and (9, 5)].\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 5), I aim for (8, 6). The path UP from (8, 6) might be slightly less crowded than navigating immediately within X=9.\n\nLet's follow the clear path to (8, 6). (8, 5) is a good intermediate step that maintains safety and high vertical flexibility. (8, 6) is a very important central point for this cluster.\n\n**Decision: UP to (8, 5)**. This immediately positions me to eat (8, 6) next turn, giving me both height and central control over the high X coordinates.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (8, 4) -> (8, 5).\nS0 is likely moving (4, 1) -> (4, 0). No chance of collision.\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=32 onwards):**\nH1 will be at (8, 5). Next target is (8, 6) (UP). If eaten, proceed to securing (9, 6) or (9, 8). Continue dominating the East side.\n\nUP",

UP: (4,2) - This is my own body! Moving here would kill me.\n2. DOWN: (4,0) - Empty space with an apple, safe\n3. LEFT: (3,1) - Empty space, safe\n4. RIGHT: (5,1) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo UP is fatal. DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nApple proximity:\n- (4,0) is directly below with an apple\n- (6,0), (6,2) are to the right and down\n- (7,4) is to the right and up\n- Cluster of apples at top right (8,6), (8,9), (9,0), (9,3), (9,5), (9,6), (9,8), (9,9)\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy is at (8,4) with body extending left along row 5\n- They're currently at (8,4) which doesn't have an apple\n- Their body blocks row 5 from x=0 to x=8\n- They might move up, down, left, or right next turn\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. DOWN toward (4,0) would:\n   * Move me onto an apple, gaining a point\n   * Extend my body downward\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward bottom apples (6,0), (6,2)\n\n2. LEFT toward (3,1) would:\n   * Move me toward the left of the board\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward left apples (1,0), (0,1)\n   * But no immediate apple gain\n\n3. RIGHT toward (5,1) would:\n   * Move me toward the center of the board\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward center/apples (6,2), (6,7), (7,4)\n   * But no immediate apple gain\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving DOWN to eat the apple at (4,0), I'll be positioned to go for the apples at (6,0) or (6,2)\n- Need to be careful about enemy movement and potential trapping\n- Continue monitoring enemy movement and prioritize apples that are safely reachable\n- Avoid getting trapped between enemy and board edges\n- Consider moving toward the cluster of apples at the top right when safe\n- Be prepared to change direction if enemy moves aggressively\n\nBest immediate move: DOWN (to eat the apple at (4,0))\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (8, 5))**\n\nMy neck is (8, 4).\n\n*   **UP (to (8, 6)):** SAFE. EATS apple (8, 6).\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 4)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 5)):** SAFE. Into my body (7, 5). WAIT! (7, 5) is 4 segments behind the head. Is it one of the last segments? My body is: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)...]. (7, 5) is segment 3. Moving LEFT is into my body and is fatal.\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 5)):** SAFE. EATS apple (9, 5).\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (4, 0))**\n\nS0's neck is (4, 1). T0 is at (2, 3), and will vacate (3, 4) if S0 doesn't eat. S0 just grew, so the tail is stationary. (2, 3) must be the new tail position. No, the tail will move forward if S0 doesn't eat. Since S0 just ate, their current body is static, and (2, 3) is the tail, which will vacate next turn if they don't eat *again*.\n\nS0 is 1 step from (5, 0) and (6, 0).\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (4, 1)):** Deadly, into neck.\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, -1)):** Deadly, off board.\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 0)):** Safe. Aiming for (1, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 0)):** EATS apple (5, 0)! Highly likely.\n\nS0 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (5, 0) and eat, increasing their score to 8 and length to 9.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move (H1 at (8, 5))**\n\nI have two equally viable apple targets: (8, 6) [UP] and (9, 5) [RIGHT]. Both moves are safe and result in immediate growth.\n\n*   **Move UP (to (8, 6)):**\n    *   Puts me in a central high position. From (8, 6), I have access to (9, 6), (9, 8), (8, 9).\n*   **Move RIGHT (to (9, 5)):**\n    *   Puts me into the X=9 column. From (9, 5), I have access to (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 3), (9, 0). This column is extremely dense with apples (7 in total).\n\nStrategy: I want to maximize my gain from the X=9 edge while maintaining flexibility. Both moves are excellent.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 5), I get closer to the cluster of (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 9).\nIf I go UP to (8, 6), I capture a key node that allows me to then pivot to (9, 6) or climb to (8, 9).\n\nLet's capitalize on the high density of the X=9 column. Moving RIGHT allows me immediate adjacency to three apples in that column: (9, 6) (UP), (9, 3) (DOWN), and (9, 8) (2 steps UP).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 5), my next optimal move would be UP to (9, 6) (eat) or UP to (9, 4) (pathing toward (9, 3)). Wait, from (9, 5), I have (9, 6) UP or (9, 4) DOWN. (9, 3) is DOWN, DOWN.\n\nLet's check the subsequent moves:\n1.  **Move RIGHT (to (9, 5)):** Eat. Next turn: UP to (9, 6) (Eat). Then UP to (9, 7) (path).\n2.  **Move UP (to (8, 6)):** Eat. Next turn: RIGHT to (9, 6) (Eat). Then UP to (9, 7) (path).\n\nBoth paths lead to eating (9, 6) after two turns, yielding 2 apples.\nR -> U leads to (9, 6) at T=33, T=34.\nU -> R leads to (9, 6) at T=33, T=34.\n\nThe RIGHT move (to 9, 5) immediately locks me into the high-apple density column (X=9), which is strategically superior for long-term apple acquisition. It also keeps me parallel to the rest of the board.\n\n**Decision: RIGHT to (9, 5).**\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (8, 5) -> (9, 5).\nS0 is likely moving (4, 0) -> (5, 0). No chance of collision.\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T=33 onwards):**\nH1 will be at (9, 5), eating. Next target is (9, 6) (UP). Continue securing the X=9 vertical line before moving to X=8 or X=7.\n\nRIGHT",

T0 is at (2, 3).\nS0 ate (5, 0) last turn, so it is still in the bottom row.\nApples nearby: (6, 0) (RIGHT, 1 step), (1, 0) (LEFT, 4 steps).\n(6, 0) is a direct apple target.\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (5, 1)):** Safe, no apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, -1)):** Deadly, off board.\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 0)):** Deadly, into neck.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 0)):** EATS apple (6, 0)! Highly likely.\n\nAssuming S0 moves RIGHT to (6, 0) and eats.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move for Snake 1 (H1 at (9, 5))**\n\nI have a critical apple at (9, 6). Moving UP is the best move by far, as it secures another apple and continues my path along the high-apple density wall (X=9).\n\n*   **Move UP (to (9, 6)):** Eat. Score: 11. Length: 12.\n*   **Move DOWN (to (9, 4)):** Safe pathing, but misses an immediate apple.\n\nIf I move UP, I will be at (9, 6), ready to claim (9, 8) and (9, 9) next.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (9, 5) -> (9, 6).\nS0's expected move: (5, 0) -> (6, 0).\nNo collision risk.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy refinement:**\n\nCurrent position is (9, 5). Moving UP to (9, 6) eats an apple.\nNext turn (T=34), H1 will be at (9, 6).\nAvailable safe moves from (9, 6):\n1. UP to (9, 7) (Empty)\n2. DOWN to (9, 5) (Into my body, safe if tail moves but I just ate, so it's my segment from T+1, and segment 2 from H1. So, potentially bad if I get trapped.)\n3. LEFT to (8, 6) (Apple!)\n\nAh, wait. If I eat at (9, 6), my body is [(9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), ...]. Moving DOWN to (9, 5) is moving into segment 1 of my body, which is fatal.\n\nSo, from (9, 6), I must go UP to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 6).\n(8, 6) is an apple 1 step away. (9, 7) is empty, leading to (9, 8) or (9, 9).\nThe path: (9, 5) -> (9, 6) [Eat] -> (8, 6) [Eat] is very strong, achieving 2 apples in 2 turns.\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 7), I can then go to (9, 8) [Eat] or (8, 7) [Path].\nPath U -> L: (9, 5) -> (9, 6) [Eat] -> (8, 6) [Eat].\nPath U -> U: (9, 5) -> (9, 6) [Eat] -> (9, 7) [Path] -> (9, 8) [Eat].\n\nBoth paths yield 2 apples quickly. The U -> L route gets the second apple quicker (T=34 vs T=35).\n\nTherefore, move UP to (9, 6). Next move should target (8, 6).\n\nUP",

Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (9, 6))**\n\nMy neck is (9, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to (9, 7)):** SAFE. Empty space. Leads towards (9, 8) A, (9, 9) A.\n*   **DOWN (to (9, 5)):** Deadly. Into my neck segment.\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 6)):** SAFE. EATS apple (8, 6). Excellent.\n*   **RIGHT (to (10, 6)):** Deadly. Off board (X=10).\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and LEFT. LEFT eats an apple.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (6, 0))**\n\nS0's neck is (5, 0). S0 is now facing resistance from the board edge and its own body segments (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0).\nApples nearby: (1, 0) (LEFT), (9, 0) (RIGHT), (6, 2) (UP, 2 steps).\nS0 is pinned against x=9, y=0.\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (6, 1)):** SAFE. No apple. Leads towards (6, 2) (A).\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, -1)):** Deadly, off board.\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 0)):** Deadly, into neck.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 0)):** SAFE. No apple. Leads towards (9, 0) (A).\n\nRationally, S0 should move UP towards (6, 2) or RIGHT towards (7, 0) / (9, 0). Since (6, 2) is closer than (9, 0), and moving right potentially gets S0 stuck in the corner if S0 moves to (9, 0) and is then blocked by the board boundary, S0 will likely choose UP to maneuver toward the center or the apple at (6, 2).\n\n*Prediction for S0: UP to (6, 1).*\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move for Snake 1 (H1 at (9, 6))**\n\nI have a choice between eating an apple immediately (LEFT to (8, 6)) or continuing along the wall pathway towards multiple apples (UP to (9, 7)).\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to (8, 6)):** Eats apple. Score: 12. Length: 13.\n    *   Next turn H1 is at (8, 6). Neck is (9, 6).\n    *   From (8, 6), safe moves are UP (8, 7, empty), DOWN (8, 5, my body/neck segment 2), LEFT (7, 6, empty), RIGHT (9, 6, my body/neck).\n    *   (9, 8) A, (9, 9) A, (8, 9) A are very close.\n    *   This move repositions me well against the high-density apples in the top right quadrant.\n\n*   **Option UP (to (9, 7)):** Pathing move. Score: 11. Length: 12.\n    *   Next turn H1 is at (9, 7). Neck is (9, 6).\n    *   From (9, 7), I can move UP (9, 8, Apple!) or LEFT (8, 7, empty).\n    *   This path ensures (9, 8) in two turns.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLEFT gets an apple now (T=34). UP gets an apple next turn (T=35).\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 6), the apple sequence potential is (8, 6) -> (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8). This avoids immediate self-collision risks by keeping me away from the wall for a moment.\nIf I move UP to (9, 7), I secure the wall apples (9, 8) and (9, 9) faster.\n\nLet's prioritize the immediate apple and maintain flexibility. Moving LEFT to (8, 6) eats the apple and then gives me access to the central area (e.g., (7, 6), (7, 7)) or allows me to curl back up to the top wall (e.g., (8, 7) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8)).\n\nThe immediate gain is superior unless it leads to a trap or collision risk.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (9, 6) -> (8, 6).\nS0's expected move: (6, 0) -> (6, 1).\nNo collision risk. The snakes are far apart.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy refinement (T=34 to T=37):**\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 6). (EAT)\n2. From (8, 6), I need to target A: (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 9).\n    *   Move (8, 6) -> UP to (8, 7) (Path).\n    *   Move (8, 7) -> UP to (8, 8) (Path).\n    *   Move (8, 8) -> RIGHT to (9, 8) (EAT) OR UP to (8, 9) (EAT). (9, 8) is easier to secure.\n    *   This secures three apples in four moves total (T=34, 35, 36, 37).\n\nThis seems like a safe and high-yield plan.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Leads towards high apple density (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 9).\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 5)):** DEADLY. Into my body segment.\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 6)):** SAFE. Empty space. Leads towards (6, 6) A, (6, 7) A, (5, 6) A.\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 6)):** DEADLY. Into my neck segment. (Former position).\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (6, 1))**\n\nS0's neck is (6, 0).\nApples nearby: (6, 2) (UP, 1 step), (6, 6) (UP), (6, 7) (UP).\nThe apple at (6, 2) is immediate.\nPossible safe moves for S0:\n1.  **UP (to (6, 2)):** SAFE. EATS apple (6, 2). Highly probable.\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, 0)):** Deadly, into neck.\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 1)):** SAFE. Pathing.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 1)):** SAFE. Pathing.\n\nS0 will almost certainly move UP to (6, 2) and score an apple.\n*Prediction for S0: UP to (6, 2).*\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move for Snake 1 (H1 at (8, 6))**\n\nI am aiming for the upper right cluster: (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 9).\n\n*   **Option UP (to (8, 7)):**\n    *   This is the direct path toward (8, 9) and (9, 8).\n    *   (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   Next turn, I will be at (8, 7) and can move UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7). This keeps the most profitable apples secure.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to (7, 6)):**\n    *   This targets the central apples (6, 6) A, (6, 7) A, (5, 6) A.\n    *   This path brings me closer to where S0 is heading (S0 is expected at (6, 2)). While S0 is far away now, moving LEFT prepares for more direct interaction/competition later.\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (6, 2), my move LEFT to (7, 6) maintains a 4-unit gap (7, 6) vs (6, 2). Safe for now.\n\n**Comparison:**\nThe top-right quadrant has 3 apples very close. The center-left quadrant has 3 apples, but S0 is gaining momentum toward them. Since I am longer and currently ahead in score, securing my current high ground and hoarding the corner apples seems strategically sounder than moving toward the enemy's path, especially when I just cleared my own corner path last turn.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 7) sets up:\nT35: (8, 6) -> (8, 7)\nT36: (8, 7) -> (8, 8) (Empty) or (9, 7) (Empty)\nT37: Secure (9, 8) A or (8, 9) A.\n\nFurthermore, UP keeps me away from the wall segments and provides great flexibility.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (8, 6) -> (8, 7).\nS0's expected move: (6, 1) -> (6, 2).\nNo collision risk. The movement paths are separated.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy refinement (T=35 to T=38):**\n1. Move UP to (8, 7) (Path).\n2. From (8, 7), move UP to (8, 8) (Path). This maintains alignment toward the corner.\n3. From (8, 8), move RIGHT to (9, 8) (EAT) OR UP to (8, 9) (EAT). (9, 8) seems the easiest target.\n4. If (9, 8) is eaten, then target (9, 9).\n\nThis aims to secure two more apples very quickly without interference.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\n**END TURN 35 RATIONALE**\nUP",

RIGHT: (7,1) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo DOWN is fatal. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nApple proximity:\n- (6,2) is directly UP - immediate apple gain\n- (1,0), (0,1) are to the left but would require going around my own body\n- (9,0) is far right\n- (6,6), (6,7) are directly above\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy is at (8,6) with body extending left along row 5 and up\n- They're currently at (8,6) which doesn't have an apple\n- Their body blocks row 5 from x=0 to x=9 and parts of row 6\n- They might move up toward the apples at (9,8), (9,9), or left toward (7,6)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1.

RIGHT toward (7,1) would:\n   * Move me rightward\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward right apples (9,0)\n   * No immediate apple gain\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving UP to (6,2) and collecting the apple, I'll be positioned to go for the apples at (6,6), (6,7)\n- Need to be careful about enemy movement and potential trapping\n- Continue monitoring enemy movement and prioritize apples that are safely reachable\n- Avoid getting trapped between enemy and board edges\n- Consider moving toward the cluster of apples at the top right when safe\n- Be prepared to change direction if enemy moves aggressively\n\nBest immediate move: UP (to collect the apple at (6,2) and position myself for future moves)\n\nUP",

This maintains a vertical approach.\n*   **Option RIGHT (to (9, 7)):** Sets up a move to (9, 8) A next turn, or U to (9, 8) A. This maintains a horizontal approach.\n*   **Option LEFT (to (7, 7)):** Detours away from the immediate goals. It brings me closer to the center, possibly to check on S0, but S0 is far enough away for now, and I want to maintain my lead by scoring.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are excellent. I need to choose the one that maximizes quick apple consumption and future space flexibility.\n\nIf I go UP to (8, 8):\nT36: (8, 7) -> (8, 8)\nT37: Move RIGHT to (9, 8) [EAT] OR Move UP to (8, 9) [EAT]? (R is slightly better positional continuation).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 7):\nT36: (8, 7) -> (9, 7)\nT37: Move UP to (9, 8) [EAT]. This is a definite direct path to an apple.\n\nRIGHT seems slightly more direct to the first apple (9, 8) and (9, 9) cluster, without sacrificing the (8, 9) option entirely.\n\n**4. Evaluate Enemy Snake's Likely Moves (S0 from (6, 2))**\n\nS0 is at (6, 2). Apples are at (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 6), (2, 7).\nSafe moves for S0: UP ((6, 3) is T0 body segment (4, 3) for S0, so (6, 3) is safe), LEFT (5, 2), RIGHT (7, 2), DOWN (6, 1) (neck/body collision).\n\n*   (6, 3) is clear (S0 body segments are at 4,x). Wait, let me check S0 body again: Body: [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)]. (6, 3) is empty.\n*   S0 is likely to continue UP towards the cluster of apples at (6, 6) and (6, 7).\n*   Prediction for S0: UP to (6, 3).\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\n\nMy move: (8, 7) -> (9, 7) (RIGHT).\nS0's expected move: (6, 2) -> (6, 3) (UP).\nNo immediate collision risk. We are separated by distance.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Refinement (T=36 to T=39):**\n\n1.  Move RIGHT to (9, 7). This positions me right below (9, 8) A.\n2.  Move UP to (9, 8) [EAT].\n3.  Move UP to (9, 9) [EAT].\n4.  If I need one more, I can move LEFT to (8, 9) [EAT], or loop back down via (8, 8) towards the center.\n\nMoving RIGHT secures the corner apples most efficiently.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\n**END TURN 36 RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

I just ate an apple (based on the previous move's rationale aiming for (9, 8)).\n    *   Length: 14 segments (Head + 13 body segments).\n    *   Goal: The apple at (9, 9) is immediately reachable. The apple at (8, 9) is next. I am in full control of the top-right corner.\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (6, 4).\n    *   Length: 11 segments (Head + 10 body segments).\n    *   Enemy appears to have moved up from (6, 3) to (6, 4), continuing its path towards the central apples (6, 6) and (6, 7).\n\n*   **Apples:** (9, 9), (8, 9) are the closest.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves for Snake 1 (from (9, 8))**\n\nMy tail is currently at (3, 5). My body segments are dense in the (9, y), (8, y), and (7, y) columns, plus a trail down the center.\n\n*   **UP (to (9, 9)):** Apple. Safe. Leads to immediate score.\n*   **DOWN (to (9, 7)):** DEADLY. Hits my own body segment (my neck/previous head position).\n*   **LEFT (to (8, 8)):** Safe. Empty square. Positioning is good for (8, 9), but sacrificing an immediate score at (9, 9) is unnecessary.\n*   **RIGHT (to (10, 8)):** DEADLY. Off the board.\n\n**3. Evaluate Collisions with Enemy Snake 0**\n\n*   Snake 0's head is at (6, 4). It is far from (9, 9). No head-on collision or body collision risk this turn.\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move**\n\nThe move UP to (9, 9) is the only one that yields an immediate apple and continues the planned harvest of the top-right corner. It is completely safe.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (T=38 to T=41)**\n\n1.  T38: UP to (9, 9) [EAT].\n2.  T39: LEFT to (8, 9) [EAT].\n3.  T40: LEFT to (7, 9) (empty) or DOWN to (8, 8) (empty), depending on S0's movement and where S0 is blocking/if more apples appear on the top edge. The 8/9 column apples are secured.\n4.  S0 is likely heading towards (6, 7) or (4, 7). I must clear the top right and then decide whether to sweep along the top edge or descend down the right side.\n\nUP",

UP: (6,5) - Empty space, safe\n2. DOWN: (6,3) - This is my own body! Moving here would kill me.\n3. LEFT: (5,4) - Empty space, safe\n4. RIGHT: (7,4) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo DOWN is fatal. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nApple proximity:\n- (6,5) is directly UP - no apple there\n- (6,6), (6,7) are to the right and above\n- (5,6) is to the left and above\n- (7,7) is to the right and above\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy is at (9,8) with body extending left along row 5 and up\n- They're currently at (9,8) which doesn't have an apple\n- Their body blocks row 5 from x=0 to x=9 and parts of row 6\n- They might move up toward the apples at (9,9), or left toward (8,7)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. UP toward (6,5) would:\n   * Move me up the board\n   * Position me better for future moves toward upper apples (6,6), (6,7)\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * This is a good move\n\n2. LEFT toward (5,4) would:\n   * Move me leftward\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward left apples (5,6)\n   * No immediate apple gain\n\n3. RIGHT toward (7,4) would:\n   * Move me rightward\n   * Keep distance from enemy\n   * Position me better for future moves toward right apples (7,7)\n   * No immediate apple gain\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After moving UP to (6,5), I'll be positioned to go for the apples at (6,6), (6,7)\n- Need to be careful about enemy movement and potential trapping\n- Continue monitoring enemy movement and prioritize apples that are safely reachable\n- Avoid getting trapped between enemy and board edges\n- Consider moving toward the cluster of apples at the top right when safe\n- Be prepared to change direction if enemy moves aggressively\n\nBest immediate move: UP (to position myself for future moves toward apples)\n\nUP",
