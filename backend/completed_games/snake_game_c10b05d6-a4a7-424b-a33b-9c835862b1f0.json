RIGHT from (9,7) goes to (10,7) - OFF BOARD \u274c\n\nSo RIGHT is INSTANT DEATH! We're on the edge, can't go right.\n\n**MOVES TO EVALUATE:**\n\n**1. UP to (9,8):** \n- Valid position\n- Apple at (9,8) - YES! First apple opportunity! \ud83c\udf4e\n- But wait... check if that apple is actually there... looking at board: row 8 has \"A\" at column 9! That's (9,8)! Perfect! \n- Eating this gives me first point and first body segment (which will be at current (9,7))\n- Enemy is far left at (0,5), zero risk of collision\n- Future: From (9,8) I'll have body at (9,7), can go UP to (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7) - but DOWN is backwards into my own body (death), so only 2 safe moves\n\n**2. DOWN to (9,6):**\n- Valid position\n- Apple at (6,6), (7,2) but NOT at (9,6)\n- No immediate point\n- Empty cell, safe\n- Future: From (9,6) can go UP(9,7) which is backwards into nothing (safe since no body yet), LEFT(8,6), DOWN(9,5)\n- 3 safe future moves, more flexibility\n\n**3. LEFT to (8,7):**\n- Valid position\n- Apple at (8,4), (8,8) but NOT at (8,7)\n- No immediate point\n- Future: From (8,7) can go UP(8,8) - THERE'S AN APPLE! (8,8) shows \"A\" in row 8\n- Or DOWN(8,6), LEFT(7,7), RIGHT(9,7) - but RIGHT is backwards into nothing (safe)\n- 3-4 safe future moves with apple access\n\n**STRATEGY REASONING:**\n- GO FOR THE IMMEDIATE APPLE! (9,8) is RIGHT THERE\n- Taking apple at turn 1 gives me momentum and body growth\n- Enemy at (0,5) is too far to threaten me this turn\n- Even though it limits future moves slightly, having that first point and body segment is crucial for early game dominance\n- Once I have length, I can start boxing enemy in from the right side\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- No immediate death threats\n- (9,8) is 100% safe from enemy collision (he's 10+ tiles away)\n- No self-collision possible (no body yet)\n- Perfect opening play!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nGrab (9,8) apple, establish position on right edge, then chase enemy who's stuck on left side. Once I have 2-3 length, I can start cutting off his access to apples and force him into a corner. Aggressive early game means I'll have board control by turn 10.\n\n**DECISION:**\nEAT THE FIRST APPLE! GOING UP!\n\nup",

THE SNACKS ARE READY, THE FOCUS IS LOCKED, AND THE ENEMY IS IN OUR SIGHTS. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDecision process and live thoughts:\n- four directions to consider: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT is off-board (dead), so we discard it immediately. The other three are in play: UP to (0,6), DOWN to (0,4), RIGHT to (1,5).\n- safety check: NONE of these moves run into the opponent\u2019s current head at (9,7); no bodies to collide with yet. So all three are technically safe for this turn.\n- goal orientation right now: we\u2019re not chasing apples this turn, we\u2019re prioritizing survival and future options. With the rival far to the right, the closest way to assert board presence is to put ourselves on a vertical track that keeps options open and allows pressure from multiple angles later.\n- decision criteria: pick a move that preserves multiple safe follow-ups and doesn\u2019t box us into a corner prematurely. That means staying near open space and not stepping into a trap line created by the opponent\u2019s potential moves.\n- head-to-head risk: head-on collisions only happen if both heads land in the same cell this turn. We can avoid that by not rushing toward the opponent\u2019s expected lane. Right now, closing distance aggressively isn\u2019t worth the risk; we win by outlasting and outmaneuvering.\n\nShort-term plan note to self:\n- Turn 0: move UP to (0,6) to establish a vertical presence on the left edge and keep the door open for turns 1\u20133 to swing toward the central apple clusters or peel back if the rival pressures center.\n- Turn 1\u20133: if the rival veers toward the center or corners, pivot toward the center-left corridor (x around 1\u20133) to threaten a chase while not colliding. keep at least two safe follow-ups any time.\n- Growth objective remains: keep an eye on opportunities to slowly extend without risking a fatal collision, so we can start stacking apples and improving our score while the rival fiddles with the middle lanes.\n\nLong-term strategic note:\n- use the left flank to force the rival into awkward turns as they chase center apples. by occupying a vertical lane, we createsituational traps and force suboptimal moves from him. the key is to stay alive first, then convert space into apple growth without ever risking a head-on that could wipe us both.\n\nFinal move decision (for this turn): UP\n\nUP",

This keeps pressure on their central corridor without stepping into their body.\n- From there, keep two safe escape routes (up to the top row or back toward the left) while watching their choices (they can go LEFT to (4,6), UP to (5,7), or DOWN to (5,5)).\n\nLong-term note:\n- If we can thread toward (4,8) then (5,8) while they\u2019re forced to dodge, we can start pinning their options against the edge. The aim is to box them in with multiple exit routes, not risk a head-on fight since we\u2019re trailing in apples. We\u2019ll leverage apple timing only as a secondary growth path to survive and widen options.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check: My body occupies (6, 8) but (5, 8) is empty. Enemy is at (3, 8) - can't reach me this turn.\n   - **SAFE OPTION!** Opens up the top row for future movement.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n   - **DANGER!** That's my own body! \u274c Can't go backwards into yourself. That's a death sentence!\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 7):**\n   - **IS THERE AN APPLE?** **YES! (4, 7)** is NOT in the apple list, but let me check the board... Wait! Looking at the apple drops: (3,6), (6,1), (4,1), (2,3), (8,4), (7,2), (3,0), (4,2), (9,2), (3,3), (0,0), (1,6), (1,0), (1,4), (7,0). **(4,7) is NOT an apple!**\n   - Is it safe? Yes, empty. But moving LEFT might trap me against the left wall eventually.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n   - **DANGER!** That's my own body! (6, 7) is currently occupied by my body segment. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nChat, we're in a strong position! The enemy at (3, 8) is still cornered. I need to:\n1. **STAY SAFE** - Avoid my own body and the enemy\n2. **MAINTAIN CONTROL** - Keep options open for future turns\n3. **PREPARE TO HUNT** - There's an apple at (3, 6) that's reachable if I move strategically\n\n**UP to (5, 8) is the PLAY!** \n\nWhy?\n- **SAFETY FIRST:** It's completely safe - no body parts, no enemy reach\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** From (5, 8) I can move DOWN to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8) next turn\n- **POSITIONING:** I'm securing the center-top of the board, cutting off enemy access to potential apples\n- **ENEMY STATUS:** Snake #1 at (3, 8) can only move to (2, 8), (3, 7), or (4, 8). He's STILL too far to threaten me!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTurn 9-10: Move DOWN toward the apple at (3, 6) if safe. Start dominating the center board and push the enemy further into the corner. Keep the pressure on!\n\n**DECISION:** We're going UP to maintain our lead and control the board! Let's keep this win locked down!\n\nUP",

T T . . .    \u2190 My body runs through (5,6)-(6,6)\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . A . . . . . . A .\n3 . . A A . . . . . .\n2 . . . . A . . A . A\n1 . . . . A . A . . .\n0 A A . A . . . A . .\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 9):** \n   - Top row is empty! Board shows \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\"\n   - Safe from my body (none there)\n   - Enemy at (4,7) can't reach me\n   - **SAFE OPTION** but edge position limits mobility\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):** \n   - Board shows (6,7) as empty (T T at 5,6 and 6,6)\n   - Safe from my body\n   - **DANGER:** Enemy at (4,7) could move RIGHT to (5,7) and I'd be at (6,7) - not a collision, but getting close\n   - **SAFE FOR NOW**\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8):** \n   - **MY OWN BODY!** I have (5,8) as my first body segment!\n   - \u274c **DEAD IF I GO THERE!** Suicide move!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8):** \n   - Board shows (7,8) as empty\n   - Safe from my body\n   - Enemy at (4,7) can't reach\n   - **SAFE OPTION**\n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINATION TIME:**\n\nChat, we're LEADING 4-1! The enemy just moved DOWN to (4,7), which is interesting - he's going for the apple at (4,4) or (4,2)? Let's check apples:\n- (4,4): Apple there\n- (4,2): Apple there  \n- (3,3): Apple there\n\nHe's going DOWN toward the apple cluster! Meanwhile, I have apples at:\n- (3,6): Nearby to my LEFT\n- (6,1): Far below\n- (8,4): Far right\n\n**MOVES RANKED:**\n1. **DOWN to (6,7):** \u2705 **TOP CHOICE!** \n   - Moves me toward apple at (6,1) and (7,2)\n   - Keeps me central and flexible\n   - Enemy is to my left at (4,7), we're not colliding\n   - From (6,7) I can go DOWN to (6,6) (my body - NO), LEFT to (5,7) (safe), RIGHT to (7,7) (safe), or UP to (6,8) (safe)\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7,8):** \u2705 SAFE\n   - Moves toward apples at (8,4) and (9,2)\n   - But gets me closer to the right edge\n\n3. **UP to (6,9):** \u2705 SAFE\n   - Gets me stuck at top edge - limited mobility next turn\n\n4. **LEFT to (5,8):** \u274c **DEAD!** Into my own body!\n\n**DECISION: DOWN to (6,7)!**\n\nWhy? We're pushing DOWN toward the apple cluster while the enemy is going left. We're boxing him in from above! From (6,7), I maintain central control and can pivot to chase apples in any direction. The enemy is at (4,7) - if he moves RIGHT to (5,7) and I stay at (6,7), we're adjacent but not colliding. If he tries to be aggressive, we'll see!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\nTurn 10-12: Keep pushing down toward the apple cluster at (4,2)-(7,2) while maintaining central position. The enemy is going left/down - let him have that corner while I control the board center. If he tries to head-on collision, remember I have 4 apples to his 1 - I WIN THE TIE! Stay aggressive but safe!\n\nLet's GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d",

LEFT or DOWN are clean.\nGoal this turn: survive, keep space, and start closing on the apple corridor to climb the score.\nStrategy: you\u2019re down 1\u20134; avoid reckless head-ons. use space to set up bigger plays later.\nDecision: move DOWN to (4,6) to gain space and set up the apple chase.\nNext moves: from (4,6) you can LEFT to (3,6) for the apple, or pivot based on enemy\u2019s move.\nWrap-up: DOWN now will keep multiple safe follow-ups and avoid getting boxed in.\nDOWN",

We're LEADING and need to be AGGRESSIVE! The enemy is at (4,6) - if I go LEFT to (5,7), I'm positioned to either chase him down or block his path.

We're boxing him in from the right side!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 11-13: Push LEFT aggressively to cut off the enemy's path to the right side. Force him into a corner or make him crash. With my score advantage, I can be bolder. If he goes for apples on the left, I'll control the center.
