Since the opponent is much closer to the apples at (3, 7) and (6, 9), they will likely target those first. The apple at (4, 4) is centrally located, and while I am slightly closer to it than the opponent is (8 moves vs 9 moves), targeting the apple at (8, 0) is safer and guarantees a point without risk of conflict or collision in the early game. Moving RIGHT initiates the path towards (8, 0) while keeping me separated from the opponent's probable path along the left side.\n\nLong-term plan:\nCollect the apple at (8, 0) to grow to size 2. After securing that apple, evaluate the board for the next target, likely moving upwards towards the center or the right side.\n\nPrimary Candidates:\nRIGHT: Moves towards (8, 0). Safe from opponent. Confirmed choice.\nUP: Moves towards (4, 4) but stays on the left column (x=0) for a while, potentially sharing the column with the opponent moving down. Less safe.\n\nAction:\nMove RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",
