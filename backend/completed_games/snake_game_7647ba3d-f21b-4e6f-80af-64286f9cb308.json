Opponent position:**\n- Snake #0 is at **(0, 8)**. Since it is quite far from me, there is no immediate threat of collision or competition over apples for the next few moves.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Strategy for this move:**\nThe best plan at this stage is to aim for the **nearest apple** (to grow and gain points quickly) while avoiding collisions with opponents, walls, or future obstacles (like my own snake body as it grows).\n\n- **Nearest apple:** Considering Manhattan distance, let's calculate:\n  - To **(8, 6):** |8 - 4| + |6 - 7| = 4 + 1 = **5**\n  - To **(7, 5):** |7 - 4| + |5 - 7| = 3 + 2 = **5**\n  - To **(6, 1):** |6 - 4| + |1 - 7| = 2 + 6 = **8**\n  - To **(9, 8):** |9 - 4| + |8 - 7| = 5 + 1 = **6**\n  - To **(1, 0):** |1 - 4| + |0 - 7| = 3 + 7 = **10**\n\nBoth **(8, 6)** and **(7, 5)** are at equal (shortest) distance of **5**.\n\n#### Decision:\nLet me prioritize **(8, 6)** first since heading that way keeps me further from **Snake #0**, and I may also be able to reach **(7, 5)** along the path afterward.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Planned move:**\nTo move to **(8, 6)**, I need to:\n- First move **RIGHT** to increase my x-coordinate.\n- Then move **DOWN** to adjust my y-coordinate.\n\n#### Immediate Move:\nFor now, moving **RIGHT** toward (5,7) is safe and progresses me toward **(8, 6)** without collision threats.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Strategy for next turn:**\n- Continue navigating toward **(8, 6)** while watching **Snake #0**'s movements. Its current position near (0, 8) poses no threat right now.\n- Keep evaluating if targeting **(7, 5)** becomes a better option depending on the board dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

Additionally, since Snake #0 is far away at **(1, 8)**, there is minimal competition for these apples.  \n- **Path Consideration:** To reach **(8, 6)**, I would need to move **RIGHT** to increase my x-coordinate, followed by a **DOWN** move to decrease my y-coordinate. This path is straightforward and avoids unnecessary risk.  \n\n#### **Future Goal:** After collecting **(8, 6)**, I can potentially adjust toward **(7, 5)** without doubling back inefficiently or colliding with the wall.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Snake #0's Position:**  \nSnake #0 is all the way at **(1, 8)** and poses no immediate threat. Its minimal proximity to any apples also means it should not interfere with my immediate plans.

Immediate Move Plan:**  \nTo start my journey toward **(8, 6)**, my next move should be **RIGHT** to bring me closer to the target.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Strategy for Next Turn:**  \n- After moving **RIGHT**, continue evaluating the progress toward **(8, 6)**. If Snake #0 unexpectedly changes direction, I may need to reassess my trajectory to avoid a collision or steal other nearby apples.  \n- Once **(8, 6)** is successfully collected, reevaluate the board to choose the next most favorable apple target (likely **(7, 5)**).\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Immediate Move: RIGHT**"

My priority remains collecting apples efficiently while avoiding collisions with walls or the enemy snake (#0).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Assessment of Apples on the Board:**  \nThere are 5 apples on the board at the following positions:\n- **(8, 6)**  \n- **(7, 5)**  \n- **(6, 1)**  \n- **(9, 8)**  \n- **(1, 0)** \n\nManhattan distances from my current position **(6, 7):**\n- To **(8, 6):** |8 - 6| + |6 - 7| = 2 + 1 = **3**  \n- To **(7, 5):** |7 - 6| + |5 - 7| = 1 + 2 = **3**  \n- To **(6, 1):** |6 - 6| + |1 - 7| = 0 + 6 = **6**  \n- To **(9, 8):** |9 - 6| + |8 - 7| = 3 + 1 = **4**  \n- To **(1, 0):** |1 - 6| + |0 - 7| = 5 + 7 = **12**  \n\nThe closest apples are the **(8, 6)** and **(7, 5)**, both with a distance of **3**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Decision Between Apples:**  \nWhile both **(8, 6)** and **(7, 5)** are equidistant, **(8, 6)** is slightly more advantageous because of the following reasons:  \n- Moving toward **(8, 6)** keeps me away from walls and centralizes my position on the board.  \n- It positions me closer to **(9, 8)**, which could be a future target.  \n- Approaching **(7, 5)** from **(8, 6)** is faster and more efficient than the reverse.\n\nI will continue to prioritize going toward **(8, 6)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.

Immediate Move Plan:**  \nFrom my position **(6, 7)**, to move closer to the apple at **(8, 6)**:\n- I first need to increase my **x-coordinate** to reach **8**.\n- My next move is therefore **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Strategy for Next Turn:**  \nIf I am successful in reaching **(8, 6)** in later moves:\n1. I will reevaluate the board to target the next closest apple. This will likely be **(7, 5)**, as it will be right next to my position.  \n2. Pay attention to Snake #0\u2019s movements to ensure no accidental collisions.   \n\nIf no new dangers appear, my strategy will focus on systematically collecting nearby apples while staying centralized to maintain flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Immediate Move: RIGHT**"

My last move was **RIGHT**, bringing me closer to the closest high-priority apple at **(8, 6)**. My task now is to determine my best move to continue progressing toward this apple, while considering future steps for efficient apple collection and avoiding dangers such as walls, the enemy snake, and future collisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Reassessing the Apples and Manhattan Distances:**  \nI will reassess the apples on the board based on my current position, **(7, 7)**:\n- **(8, 6):** |8 - 7| + |6 - 7| = 1 + 1 = **2**  \n- **(7, 5):** |7 - 7| + |5 - 7| = 0 + 2 = **2**  \n- **(6, 1):** |6 - 7| + |1 - 7| = 1 + 6 = **7**  \n- **(9, 8):** |9 - 7| + |8 - 7| = 2 + 1 = **3**  \n- **(1, 0):** |1 - 7| + |0 - 7| = 6 + 7 = **13**  \n\nThe **closest apples** to my current position are **(8, 6)** and **(7, 5)**, both at a Manhattan distance of **2**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Decision Between Apples (8, 6) and (7, 5):**  \nSince both apples are equally close, I'll need to evaluate which path provides me with more strategic advantages.  \n\n**Advantages of targeting (8, 6):**  \n- **(8, 6)** is in a central location and keeps me flexible to pivot toward other apples like **(9, 8)** or eventually **(7, 5)**.  \n- I would avoid moving toward the bottom-left corner too soon, which limits space and options.  \n- Grabbing this apple first allows me to approach **(7, 5)** in subsequent moves with minimal backtracking.  \n\n**Potential Risks:**  \n- There are **no risks immediately apparent** for moving toward **(8, 6)** because the path is clear, and I am not near walls or the enemy snake.  \n\nBecause of its strategic flexibility, **(8, 6)** remains my preferred target for now.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Obstacles and Threat Assessments:**  \n- **Snake #0 Threat:** The enemy snake (#0) is all the way at **(3, 8)**. It poses no immediate threat to me as it is currently far from both my position and my most probable moves.  \n- **Wall Threats:** The grid is **10x10**, and I am safely near the center at **(7, 7)**. There is no danger of running into walls in the foreseeable future, even while pursuing **(8, 6)**.  \n- **Self-Collision:** I have no body segments yet, so I don\u2019t need to worry about colliding with myself at this time.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Immediate Move Plan:**  \nTo move closer to the apple at **(8, 6)**:  \n1. I need to **increase my x-coordinate** to 8.  \n2. I should also **decrease my y-coordinate** to 6.  \n\nThe **optimal move now** is **DOWN** to **(7, 6)** because:\n- It positions me one step closer to **(8, 6)** while maintaining strategic flexibility.  \n- Moving **RIGHT** now to **(8, 7)** would set me up for the **same distance (2 turns)** to the apple, but it limits my flexibility for other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**  \nOnce I\u2019m at **(7, 6)**, I\u2019ll reassess the situation. If I remain unchallenged, I can safely move **RIGHT** to grab **(8, 6)** on the following turn.  \n- After securing **(8, 6)**, my next logical target will likely be **(7, 5)** due to its proximity.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move:**  \n**DOWN**"

Current Position and Context Recap:**\n- My current position as Snake **#1**: **(7, 5)**.\n- My body: **[(8, 5), (8, 6)]** trailing behind. I recently moved LEFT to this position and secured an apple, growing by 1 segment.\n- Updated apple locations: **(6, 1)**, **(9, 8)**, **(1, 0)**, **(0, 0)**, and **(7, 5)** is now cleared.\n- Enemy Snake **#0** is still positioned far away at **(7, 8)** with no body.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Updated Apple Targets and Strategy:**\nWith no nearby apples at my current location, I need to begin moving strategically toward the next viable apple. The available apples include:\n- **(6, 1):**  \n  Manhattan distance from **(7, 5)** is |7 - 6| + |5 - 1| = **5**. Moving LEFT and then DOWN repeatedly puts me on course for this apple while keeping me away from the enemy and the board edges.  \n- **(9, 8):**  \n  Manhattan distance: |7 - 9| + |5 - 8| = **5**. This apple requires moving UP and RIGHT, putting me in a less flexible position near the top-right corner. Additionally, Snake **#0** is located near this quadrant, increasing potential risk.  \n- **(1, 0):**  \n  Manhattan distance: |7 - 1| + |5 - 0| = **11**. This is too far to prioritize.  \n- **(0, 0):**  \n  Manhattan distance: |7 - 0| + |5 - 0| = **12**. This is also too far and unlikely to be worth pursuing anytime soon.\n  \nThe clear next target is **(6, 1)**. This apple has the shortest travel distance and positions me in the lower-left quadrant, where another nearby apple (**(1, 0)**) can be targeted next. These moves keep me far from Snake **#0**, avoid the edges, and focus on sustained growth.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Risk Assessment for Immediate Move:**\nMy immediate position at **(7, 5)** has no nearby threats:\n- **Self-Collision:** My only body segments are trailing right and up at **(8, 5)** and **(8, 6)**. Moving LEFT or DOWN will not cause collisions.\n- **Enemy Snake:** Snake **#0** is far away at **(7, 8)** and does not pose an immediate risk.\n- **Board Edges:** Moving LEFT or DOWN keeps me relatively central. There's no immediate threat of hitting walls.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Strategy for This Move:**\nTo begin traveling toward **(6, 1)**, I will first move LEFT to **(6, 5)**. This positions me closer to the apple while staying flexible. Once there, I can begin moving DOWN toward the target.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Future Strategy:**\nAfter securing **(6, 1)**, I should reassess the board. Depending on the enemy snake's actions and available apple locations, my likely next targets will be **(1, 0)** and **(0, 0)**, which let me dominate the lower-left quadrant efficiently.\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Move Decision:**\nMy move is **LEFT** to **(6, 5)**."

Current Position and Context Recap:**\n- **My snake's head:** (6, 3)\n- **My body:** [(6, 4), (6, 5)], trailing directly above me.\n- **Apples are located at:**  \n  - **(6, 1):** **Still the nearest apple**.  \n    - Manhattan distance = |6 - 6| + |3 - 1| = 2.  \n  - **(1, 0), (0, 0):** Down in the bottom-left corner, farther than (6, 1).  \n  - **(7, 2):** Slightly right and down. It's farther than (6, 1) and would require unnecessary deviation.  \n  - **(1, 7):** Still the farthest away; not a priority.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Risk & Collision Assessment for Immediate Move:**\n- **Self-Collision Risks:**  \n  My snake's body is not blocking my direct path downward toward the target apple at (6, 1). However:  \n  - Moving **UP** to (6, 4) is unsafe because it directly collides with my body.  \n  - Moving **LEFT** to (5, 3): Safe but unnecessary\u2014this moves me off-course from the (6, 1) target.  \n  - Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 3): Safe, but again unnecessary for reaching the target efficiently.  \n\n- **Enemy Risks:**  \n  - Snake #0 is still at (9, 7), too far to affect me in the short term. Its movement does not pose any threat to the area around (6, 1) or my immediate trajectory.\n\n- **Wall Risks:**  \n  - Moving **DOWN** to (6, 2) keeps me well within bounds and clear of walls.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Path/Strategy Toward the Next Apple (6, 1):**\n- The clear and most direct path to (6, 1) is to continue moving **DOWN**, following a straight line along the x = 6 column.  \n- This move avoids unnecessary deviations and ensures proximity to other apples, like (1, 0) and (0, 0), for future turns.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Tracking Next Steps and Future Strategy:**\n- Assuming I successfully pick up the apple at (6, 1), my reevaluation will prioritize apples at (1, 0) and (0, 0), which are closer to one another and farther from opposing snakes.  \n- I will also monitor Snake #0\u2019s movements, though it is still far away and not currently threatening.  \n\n---\n  \n### **Final Move Decision:**  \nI will move **DOWN** to (6, 2).  \n\n**Next Turn Strategy:** If safe, continue heading **DOWN** toward the apple at (6, 1)."

That would be hitting myself and I'd die.\n- RIGHT: Would go to (10, 7) - that's off the board, so I'd hit a wall and die.\n- DOWN: Would go to (9, 6) - this is safe and open.\n- LEFT: Would go to (8, 7) - this is also safe and open.\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN or LEFT.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- The enemy snake #1 is at (6, 3) with body at [(6, 4), (6, 5)], positioned in the middle-left area\n- There are several apples in the lower portion of the board: (6, 1), (7, 2), (1, 0), (0, 0)\n- There's also an apple at (1, 7) on the left side\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 6), I'd be moving toward the lower apple cluster, which could be good for collecting multiple apples.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 7), I'd be starting to move across the board, potentially toward either the (1, 7) apple or working my way toward the lower apple cluster from a different angle.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position at (6, 3), they seem to be in a good position to compete for the lower apples. The apple at (1, 7) might be less contested since it's further from their current position.\n\nI think moving LEFT to start working across the board gives me more strategic flexibility and potentially less direct competition with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving LEFT or assess whether to move DOWN toward the lower apple cluster.

The enemy snake #1 is at position (6, 1) with body at [(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)].\n\nAvailable apples: (1, 0), (0, 0), (7, 2), (1, 7), (2, 2)\n\nLet me analyze my movement options:\n- UP: Would go to (7, 8) - safe and open\n- DOWN: Would go to (7, 6) - safe and open\n- LEFT: Would go to (6, 7) - safe and open\n- RIGHT: Would go to (8, 7) - that's where my body is! Would kill me\n\nSo I have three safe options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nStrategic analysis:\nMy previous plan was to continue LEFT toward the apple at (1, 7), which is still a good strategy since:\n1. It's 6 moves away horizontally\n2. The enemy snake is still focused on the lower part of the board near apples (7, 2) and the bottom row apples\n3. Moving LEFT to (6, 7) continues my path toward the (1, 7) apple\n4. This keeps me away from the enemy snake's current area of operation\n\nHowever, I should also consider the apple at (7, 2). If I went DOWN, I could potentially reach it, but that would put me in direct competition with the enemy snake who is already closer to that area.\n\nThe safest and most strategic move is to continue LEFT toward (1, 7). This apple appears uncontested and gives me a clear objective.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving LEFT toward the (1, 7) apple. After collecting it, reassess the board state and consider whether to go for the lower apple cluster or look for new apple spawns.\n\nLEFT"
