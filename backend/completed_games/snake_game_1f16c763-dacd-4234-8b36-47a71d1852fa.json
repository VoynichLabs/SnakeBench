It slides us to (3,3), right next to apples at (4,3) and (2,3). That\u2019s a double\u2011apple buffet! Plus we stay far from the enemy at (9,8).  \n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term Plan: Move DOWN now, then next turn grab either (4,3) or (2,3). Keep the board wide open, avoid corners, and watch the rival\u2019s moves like a hawk. \ud83e\udd85  \nDOWN",

Apples everywhere, but we're playing for DOMINANCE, not just snacks.\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (9,9): That's on the board. No body there (we have no body yet). Enemy body? None. Apple at (9,9) though! That's a potential grow. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (9,7): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (8,8): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (10,8): OFF THE BOARD. \u274c DEATH. Eliminated.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy prediction. Enemy at (3,4). They have four moves: Up to (3,5), Down to (3,3), Left to (2,4), Right to (4,4). All are safe for them right now. They might go for the apple at (4,3) or (2,3) or (3,1). Hard to guess.\n\nWe need to think about future safety and aggression. We're in the top-right corner. Moving LEFT (8,8) opens more space\u2014central board access. Moving DOWN (9,7) also opens space but stays near wall. Moving UP (9,9) eats apple but traps us in the corner\u2014next turn only DOWN or LEFT from (9,9), which could be risky if enemy approaches later.\n\nBut it's turn 1! We need to GROW to get longer than enemy so we can force head-on collisions later. Eating an apple now gives us a body segment, making us longer. If we eat at (9,9), next turn our tail will be at (9,8)? Wait, growth: if we eat apple this turn, our head moves to (9,9) and we grow, so our body will be [(9,8)] next turn. That means from (9,9) our body is behind us at (9,8), so moving DOWN next turn would be into our own body (backwards) and kill us! So from (9,9) only LEFT to (8,9) is safe next turn (UP off board, RIGHT off board, DOWN into new body). That's a HUGE trap\u2014only one safe move next turn. That's getting boxed in early! Not good.\n\nSo maybe avoid eating that corner apple right now. Let's keep mobility.\n\nLEFT to (8,8) gives options: from there we can go UP to (8,9) (apple), LEFT to (7,8), DOWN to (8,7). Three options. Better.\n\nDOWN to (9,7) gives options: LEFT to (8,7), DOWN to (9,6), UP back to (9,8) (empty now). Also three options.\n\nI think LEFT is best\u2014moves us toward center, away from corner, sets up to cut off enemy later. Also, from (8,8) we're closer to apples at (8,5), (7,4), (6,7) eventually.\n\nEnemy is far away, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grow to length 2 soon, then try to maneuver to cut off enemy's movement options. Use our top-right start to possibly wall them off. Keep an eye on their score\u2014if they eat an apple, we need to match or exceed to win head-on.\n\nAlright chat, we're going LEFT to claim more board! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "LET'S GO CHAT! Turn 2 and we're at (8,8) with a clean board! \ud83d\ude24 Time to assert dominance early!\n\nFirst, check immediate safety for each move from (8,8):\n\n- **UP** to (8,9): On board. No body (we have none). Enemy body? None. Apple at (8,9)? Actually looking at board: row 9 has apples at (1,9) and (9,9). (8,9) is empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (8,7): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (7,8): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,8): On board, empty (we were there last turn, now vacant). \u2705 SAFE.\n\nAll four moves are safe! Good.\n\nNow enemy prediction: Enemy head at (3,3). They have apples nearby at (4,3), (2,3), (3,1). They'll likely go for one. Let's map their possible moves:\n- Up to (3,4): empty.\n- Down to (3,2): empty.\n- Left to (2,3): APPLE.\n- Right to (4,3): APPLE.\n\nThey'll probably go for an apple to grow. If they go Left or Right, they eat and grow to length 2. That means next turn they'll have a body behind them.\n\nWe need to match or exceed their length to win head-on collisions. Right now we're both length 1. If we eat an apple this turn, we become length 2 and tie if they eat. If they eat and we don't, they're longer\u2014dangerous.\n\nBut also, we must think about future mobility. Where are apples we can reach?\n\nNear us: (8,5) below-left, (7,4) further down-left, (6,7) left-down, (9,9) up-right, (8,3) far down.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9,8), we're back in the corner\u2014limited next moves (only LEFT or DOWN from there). Not great.\n\nIf we move UP to (8,9), we're near top edge but have options LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT? From (8,9): UP off board, RIGHT to (9,9) apple but corner, DOWN to (8,8) empty, LEFT to (7,9) empty. Actually three safe moves next turn unless we eat (9,9) and grow\u2014then we'd have body at (8,9) and from (9,9) only LEFT safe. So maybe avoid (9,9) for now.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7,8), we move toward center, more open space, closer to apples (7,4), (6,7). Good.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8,7), also central, opens paths.\n\nI think we should eat an apple THIS TURN to grow and match enemy if they eat. Which apple can we get safely while keeping options?\n\nFrom (8,8), moving LEFT to (7,8) doesn't get apple. Moving DOWN to (8,7) no apple. Moving RIGHT to (9,8) no apple. Moving UP to (8,9) no apple.\n\nWait\u2014no apple adjacent! So we can't grow this turn unless we move to a cell with apple\u2014nearest apples are (9,9) (move RIGHT then UP next turn? no), (8,5) far, (7,4) far.\n\nSo we can't grow this turn. That means if enemy eats, they'll be longer next turn. That's risky. But we can plan to eat soon.\n\nWe need to position to cut off enemy and get apples next turn. Moving LEFT (7,8) puts us closer to (7,4) and (8,5). Moving DOWN (8,7) also closer to (8,5). I think LEFT is better\u2014more central control.\n\nAlso, think about head-on collision: if enemy moves toward us, we want to be longer. We're equal length now, so head-on kills both. Avoid that.\n\nLong-term plan: Get to an apple next turn. From (7,8), possible moves next turn: DOWN to (7,7) then toward (8,5) or (7,4). Or LEFT to (6,8) then toward (6,7) apple. Good options.\n\nLet's also consider enemy's possible path: if they go left to (2,3) apple, their body will be at (3,3). They might then move up/down/right next turn. They're far away (5 columns away). We have time.\n\nAlright chat, we're going LEFT to take control of the center and set up for an apple grab next turn! DOMINANCE INCOMING! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Yes (y=9). Occupied? Board shows row 9: (1,9) apple, (9,9) apple. (7,9) empty. Enemy body? None. Our body? None. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (7,7): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (6,8): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,8): On board, empty (we were there last turn, now vacant). \u2705 SAFE.\n\nAll four moves are safe! Good.\n\nNow enemy prediction: Enemy head at (2,3), body at (3,3). They have apples nearby at (1,2), (4,3), (3,1), (2,3)?? Wait, (2,3) is their head now, apple was there last turn? Actually board shows apple at (1,2) and (4,3) nearby. They might go for (1,2) (down-left) or (4,3) (right). They could also move up to (2,4) empty.\n\nIf they eat an apple, they grow to length 3 (head + 2 body segments). Right now we are length 1. That's a HUGE length disadvantage! We need to eat ASAP to catch up!\n\nLook at apples we can reach soon:\n- (6,7) is close! From (7,8), DOWN to (7,7), then LEFT to (6,7) gets apple next turn.\n- (7,4) is farther but reachable in a few moves.\n- (8,5) is also close: from (7,8), DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5) \u2014 too many turns.\n- (9,9) is far and corner.\n\nBest immediate apple is (6,7). So we want to move toward it.\n\nFrom (7,8), moving LEFT to (6,8) doesn't get us closer to (6,7) in Manhattan distance? Actually from (6,8) to (6,7) is DOWN next turn. From (7,8) to (6,7) is DOWN-LEFT in two moves. Either way, we need DOWN eventually.\n\nBut also, we must consider future mobility: moving LEFT to (6,8) puts us near left edge (x=0 far but okay). Moving DOWN to (7,7) central. UP to (7,9) top edge. RIGHT to (8,8) back toward right edge.\n\nWe want to avoid corners/edges early. Also, we need to avoid head-on collision with enemy. They're far away (distance 5 in x, 5 in y). Low risk this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Get to (6,7) apple next turn, grow to length 2, then keep eating to match enemy length. Enemy might be length 3 soon, so we need two apples to tie. We can do this!\n\nWhich move sets up best for (6,7)? If we go DOWN to (7,7), next turn we can go LEFT to (6,7) apple. That's perfect! If we go LEFT to (6,8), next turn DOWN to (6,7) apple also works. Both work.\n\nBut from (7,7), we have more central options after eating (6,7) \u2014 we can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT potentially. From (6,7) after eating, we might be more constrained near left edge? Actually (6,7) is fine.\n\nAlso, consider enemy possibly moving toward center. We want to control center. DOWN feels more central.\n\nChat, what do you think? \ud83d\ude08 Let's go DOWN to (7,7) to line up that apple grab next turn! DOMINANCE INCOMING!\n\nDOWN",

Good to plan ahead!\n\nThus, after eating at (6,7), our safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. That's 3 options, still good.\n\nWhat about other moves? If we go UP/DOWN/RIGHT now, we delay the apple, enemy might get farther ahead. AGGRESSION is key!\n\nAlso, consider head-on collision risk: Enemy is far away (distance 5 in x, 5 in y).

They have apple at (1,2) right under their head? Wait, board shows at (1,2) is '0' (their head). Apple at (1,2)? No, apple list has (1,5), (2,1), etc. Actually looking at board row 2: \". 0 T . . . . . . .\" So (1,2) is enemy head, (2,2) is 'T' (their tail?), but their body list says body: [(2,2), (2,3)]. So (2,2) is body, (2,3) is tail. So (1,2) is head, no apple there. Apple at (2,1) is nearby.\n\nEnemy possible moves from (1,2):\n- UP to (1,3): empty.\n- DOWN to (1,1): empty? Board row 1: \". .

But still not directly.\n\n**LEFT to (5,7)**: Moves toward apple at (4,3)? Not really. But moves us west, closer to enemy? Actually moving left increases x-distance from enemy. Might be safer from immediate clash.\n\nWe need to think about future safe moves after each choice:\n\nFrom (6,8):\n- Next turn safe moves? Body at (6,7), so can't go DOWN (into body). So UP, LEFT, RIGHT possible? Check: UP (6,9) empty, LEFT (5,8) empty, RIGHT (7,8) empty. 3 options.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n- Body at (6,7), so can't go UP (into body). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT possible? DOWN (6,5) empty, LEFT (5,6) empty, RIGHT (7,6) empty. 3 options.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n- Body at (6,7), so can't go RIGHT (into body). So UP, DOWN, LEFT possible? UP (5,8) empty, DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT (4,7) empty. 3 options.\n\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn. So equal immediate flexibility.\n\nNow, apples: Looking at board, apples at (7,5), (4,3), (0,8), (9,1), (1,5), (2,9), (7,4), (9,9), (8,3), (8,5), (3,1), (4,8), (2,7), (2,1), (3,7).\n\nClosest to us? (7,4) is at distance |6-7|+|7-4|=1+3=4. (7,5): 1+2=3. (8,5): 2+2=4. (8,3): 2+4=6. (4,3): 2+4=6. (3,7): 3+0=3! Wait (3,7) is at x=3,y=7. Our head (6,7) to (3,7) is |3|+0=3. That's actually closest! And it's to our LEFT! So apple at (3,7) is 3 steps left.\n\nAlso (2,7) is at x=2,y=7, distance 4 left.\n\nSo moving LEFT gets us closer to apple at (3,7) and (2,7). That's content!\n\nEnemy might go for (2,1) or (3,1). They're far from (3,7). So we can claim that apple soon.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to grow to match enemy length. Let's snake toward (3,7) while keeping an escape path. Also, we can try to cut off enemy's expansion by moving toward center-left.\n\nChat, the move is LEFT! It's safe, it gets us closer to the nearest apple, and it keeps options open. We'll be at (5,7) next, then possibly (4,7), then (3,7) to eat in two turns if we want.\n\nLEFT",

They'll be longer, more dangerous.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?** Our head (5,7) vs enemy (1,1) \u2013 distance 4 in x, 6 in y. No chance.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & APPLE PATHING:**\n\nApples nearby: (3,7) is 2 steps left! (2,7) is 3 steps left. (7,4) and (7,5) are east/south. (4,8) is north-west.\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (4,7): Gets us closer to (3,7) apple. Next turn from (4,7), body at (5,7), so can't go RIGHT. But UP, DOWN, LEFT still open.

Still 3 options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy will grow to length 4. We need to grow ASAP. Closest apple is (3,7) \u2013 let's claim it! Also, we need to think about boxing them in later. They're in bottom-left, we're center-left. If we go LEFT now, we can eat (3,7) next turn or the turn after, then maybe cut off their upward expansion by moving south toward (2,7) or (3,1) apples.\n\nBut wait \u2013 if enemy goes RIGHT to (2,1) and eats apple, they'll be at (2,1) with length 4. Their body will block some of their own moves. They might then head toward (3,1) apple or (2,9) etc.\n\nWe should prioritize growth and positioning to eventually trap them against walls or our body.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** LEFT toward (3,7) apple.

Yes. Occupied? Board shows '.' at (3,8) (row 8 col 3). No enemy body. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (3,6): On board, empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (2,7): On board, APPLE at (2,7)! \ud83c\udf4e No enemy body. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): That's OUR OWN BODY segment! \u274c DEATH.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (3,1). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (3,2): Empty.\n- DOWN to (3,0): Empty.\n- LEFT to (2,1): Their own body! \u274c would die.\n- RIGHT to (4,1): Empty, apple at (4,3) is south but not immediate.\n\nThey probably won't suicide into their body, so UP, DOWN, RIGHT are options. They might go for apple at (4,3) by moving RIGHT then DOWN next turns, or UP to explore.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?** Our head (3,7) vs enemy (3,1) \u2013 distance 0 in x, 6 in y. No chance this turn.\n\n**APPLE PRIORITY:** Closest apples to us: (2,7) is 1 step LEFT! (4,8) is 1 step UP then 1 RIGHT? Wait, from (3,7), UP is (3,8) no apple, but (4,8) is nearby. (0,8) far left. (2,9) far up-left.\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (2,7): We eat the apple! \ud83c\udf4e Grow to length 4, score becomes 3. Body extends to (3,7),(4,7),(5,7). Next turn from (2,7), we can't go RIGHT (into our new body at (3,7)), but UP, DOWN, LEFT open. That puts us closer to (0,8) or (2,9).\n\nIf we go **UP** to (3,8): No apple. Stay length 3, score 2. Body at (3,7),(4,7),(5,7). Next turn from (3,8), can't go DOWN (into body), but UP, LEFT, RIGHT open. Gets us toward (4,8) apple next.\n\nIf we go **DOWN** to (3,6): No apple. Stay length 3, score 2. Body at (3,7),(4,7),(5,7). Next turn from (3,6), can't go UP (into body), but DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT open. Moves us toward bottom apples like (4,3),(3,3).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is length 5, we're length 3. We NEED to grow FAST to compete! Eating apples is CRITICAL. LEFT gives us an apple NOW. Also, moving LEFT positions us to potentially cut off enemy's northward expansion along the left side. We can try to wall them in against the left border (x=0) since their body is already near there.\n\nGoing UP or DOWN delays growth, lets enemy get even longer. We must be AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**BEST MOVE:** LEFT to eat the apple at (2,7)! Grow to length 4, close the gap in score, and start pressuring from the north-west.\n\nLEFT",

We NEED to grow FAST and CUT THEM OFF! We should move toward the NORTH-WEST to claim apples (2,9) and (0,8) and maybe try to trap them against the left wall later. Our body is along row 7, blocking their northward path a bit. If we go UP, we get closer to (2,9). If we go LEFT, we get closer to (0,8). Going DOWN feels like retreating and gives them space.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\n- **UP to (2,8)**: Next turn from (2,8), can't go DOWN (into body at (2,7)), but UP, LEFT, RIGHT likely open.

UP gets us closest to an apple NEXT turn, and keeps us aggressive in the north. LEFT also good but slightly further from immediate apple. DOWN is too passive.\n\n**DECISION:** UP! Let's claim that top row and pressure from above! We need to match their growth pace! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, RIGHT ARE SAFE.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (5,1), body at [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]. Their possible moves:\n- UP to (5,2): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5,0): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,1): Their own body! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (6,1): Empty.\n\nThey have NO adjacent apple right now! They might go UP or DOWN to maneuver. They're longer, so they might try to cut us off or go for apples in the center.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?** Our head (2,8) vs enemy (5,1) \u2014 distance 3 in x, 7 in y. NO CHANCE.\n\n**APPLE PRIORITY:** Closest apples to us:\n- (2,9) \u2014 1 step UP! \ud83c\udf4e IMMEDIATE GROWTH!\n- (0,8) \u2014 2 steps LEFT.\n- (4,8) \u2014 2 steps RIGHT? Actually from (2,8), RIGHT to (3,8) then UP to (3,9)? Wait (3,9) is empty. (4,8) is RIGHT 2, DOWN 0? No, (4,8) is at y=8, x=4, so from (2,8) it's RIGHT 2.\n- (3,3), (4,3) are far.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** WE NEED TO GROW! Enemy has 5 apples, we have 3. If we eat (2,9) now, we tie at 4! LET'S GO! That also puts our head on the top row, which could be risky later but gives us momentum. Going LEFT or RIGHT doesn't get us an apple this turn. So UP is the AGGRESSIVE, GROWTH play! After eating, we'll be length 5, same as enemy! Then we can think about trapping them against the top wall or cutting off their path to the north apples.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\n- **UP to (2,9)**: Eat apple, grow to length 5. Next turn from (2,9), can't go DOWN (into our new body at (2,8)? Wait, after growth, our tail stays, so body will be [(2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7)]. So from (2,9), DOWN to (2,8) is our own body! \u274c So UP would leave only LEFT, RIGHT, and UP (if on board, but row 9 is top, so UP is off-board). So from top row, only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's a bit limiting, but we can handle it.\n- **LEFT to (1,8)**: No apple. Next turn from (1,8), more options open (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely). But delays growth.\n- **RIGHT to (3,8)**: No apple. Similar to LEFT.\n\n**BEST MOVE?** UP gets the apple, ties the score, and pressures from the top! We accept the slight risk of being on the edge next turn because we NEED to catch up! AGGRESSION IS KEY! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP! LET'S EAT AND TIE THIS UP! \n\nUP",

Actually (4,8) is at x=4,y=8, so from (3,9) it's DOWN to (3,8), then RIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 3 steps.\n- (9,9) \u2014 FAR.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** WE NEED TO GET OFF THE TOP ROW SAFELY AND CLOSE THE APPLE GAP! Enemy is at (5,2), moving north. If we go LEFT, we move toward the left side apples (0,8), (0,6). If we go RIGHT, we move toward center apples (4,8), (3,3), etc. BUT we must think about FUTURE OPTIONS!\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\n- **LEFT to (1,9)**: Next turn from (1,9), safe moves? UP off-board \u274c, DOWN to (1,8) likely safe (empty now), LEFT to (0,9) on board and empty, RIGHT to (2,9) \u2014 but that's our current head, will be empty after we move? Actually our body stays at (2,9)? Wait, after moving LEFT, our new body will be [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7)]. So (2,9) becomes our neck! So from (1,9), RIGHT to (2,9) is OUR OWN BODY next turn! \u274c So from (1,9), only DOWN and LEFT are safe? That's only 2 options. Risky!\n- **RIGHT to (3,9)**: Next turn from (3,9), safe moves? UP off-board \u274c, DOWN to (3,8) empty, LEFT to (2,9) \u2014 our neck (body), so \u274c, RIGHT to (4,9) on board and empty. So from (3,9), only DOWN and RIGHT are safe \u2014 also 2 options.\n\nBOTH give us 2 safe moves next turn. BUT! Going RIGHT puts us closer to the enemy's possible path north? Enemy might go to (5,3) or (4,2). We want to maybe swing around and cut them off from the top apples.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're tied in length, enemy still +1 apple. Avoid head-on until we have length advantage. Move toward left side to control that area and maybe trap enemy against wall. From (1,9) next turn, go DOWN to (1,8) to open more options and approach apple at (0,8). Keep an eye on enemy heading toward (4,3) apple.\n\n**BEST MOVE?** LEFT feels better \u2014 it takes us toward the left side where there are apples and maybe more space. RIGHT brings us slightly closer to enemy's north path, but not by much. LET'S GO LEFT AND START WORKING THE LEFT FLANK! \n\nLEFT",

Our head (1,9) vs enemy (5,3) \u2014 distance 4 in x, 6 in y. NO CHANCE THIS TURN.\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:\n- **DOWN to (1,8)**: Next turn from (1,8), safe moves? UP to (1,9) \u2014 our neck? Wait, after moving down, our body: [(1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7)]? Actually careful: We grow only if we eat an apple. We're not eating now, so our tail (3,7) will disappear when we move? NO \u2014 in Snake, if you don't eat, you move forward and the tail cell becomes empty. So our new body will be head at (1,8), then (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7). So (1,9) is our neck. So from (1,8), UP to (1,9) is OUR BODY \u274c. DOWN to (1,7) empty? Board shows '.' \u2705. LEFT to (0,8) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705. RIGHT to (2,8) our body? (2,8) is in our new body! \u274c. So from (1,8), only DOWN and LEFT are safe \u2014 2 options again, but LEFT leads to apple (0,8)!\n- **LEFT to (0,9)**: Next turn from (0,9), safe moves? UP off-board \u274c, DOWN to (0,8) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705, LEFT off-board \u274c, RIGHT to (1,9) our neck \u274c. So ONLY DOWN is safe \u2014 THAT'S A DEAD END NEXT TURN! \ud83d\ude2c Going LEFT traps us on the left edge with only one safe move next turn \u2014 RISKY!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to close the apple gap FAST! Enemy likely eating (4,3) this turn. We must secure (0,8) next turn to get to 5 apples and stay in the race. But we must also keep options open! Going DOWN to (1,8) sets us up to go LEFT to (0,8) next turn for the apple, AND keeps DOWN as an escape. Going LEFT to (0,9) forces us to take the apple next turn (down to (0,8)) but then we have NO escape after eating \u2014 we'd be stuck at (0,8) with only maybe up (off-board) or right (into our growing body)? Too dangerous!\n\nBEST MOVE? DOWN to (1,8)! This keeps us flexible, sets up the apple grab next turn, and avoids getting trapped on the edge. We need to survive and grow, then maybe cut off the enemy's path upward. Enemy will be longer, so we avoid head-on until we match length.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: From (1,8), go LEFT to (0,8) to eat apple and grow to length 6. Then immediately look for escape routes \u2014 maybe down to (0,7) if empty. Enemy will be at (4,3) or nearby, length 7. We'll still be behind, but we're in the fight! Control the left side, then swing down to challenge the center. AVOID head-on until length advantage!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING SURVIVAL AND SCALING! LET'S GO DOWN AND SET UP THE APPLE PLAY! \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

But if we take it and get trapped, we die next turn! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nSTRATEGY ADJUSTMENT: Maybe we can take the apple AND survive? What if we go LEFT to (0,8) to eat, then next turn we MUST go DOWN to (0,7). Is (0,7) safe next turn? It's empty now, but enemy could move there? Unlikely from (5,4). But after moving down to (0,7), our body will be long, blocking our right. We'd be stuck along the left wall with limited moves \u2014 that's a slow death! So maybe AVOID the apple for now?\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to survive and outmaneuver! Enemy is longer, so we avoid head-on. Going DOWN to (1,7) keeps options open, lets us maybe swing right toward center apples later. We can let enemy have the left-side apple? But they're far away. Actually, apple at (0,8) is ours if we want it next turn from (1,7) by going LEFT to (0,7) then UP to (0,8)? That's two turns, enemy might not get it. But we need to close the gap!\n\nDECISION: SURVIVAL OVER GREED! Going DOWN to (1,7) keeps us alive with multiple exits. Going LEFT to (0,8) is a greedy trap! We'll take the safe route, keep pressure, and look for a better apple opportunity soon. Maybe we can target (0,6) or (1,5) later. Enemy might go for (4,3) or (3,3), growing to 7. We'll be at 4, but alive and flexible. We can't win if we're dead!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME! LET'S GO DOWN AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOO! OPTIONS! \ud83d\ude24\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: At (6,4). Their safe moves?\n- UP to (6,5): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (6,5) is an apple! They eat and grow to 7!\n- DOWN to (6,3): Empty '.'.\n- LEFT to (5,4): Their own body! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,4): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (7,4) is also an apple! They eat and grow to 7!\n\nTHEY HAVE TWO APPLE MOVES AND ONE EMPTY MOVE! THEY'RE DEFINITELY EATING THIS TURN AND GROWING TO LENGTH 7! WE'RE FALLING BEHIND! \ud83d\ude31\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? Our head (1,7) vs enemy (6,4) \u2014 distance 5 in x, 3 in y. NO CHANCE THIS TURN.\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:\n- **DOWN to (1,6)**: No apple. New body: head at (1,6), then (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). Next turn from (1,6), safe moves? UP to (1,7) our neck \u274c, DOWN to (1,5) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705, LEFT to (0,6) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705, RIGHT to (2,6) empty '.' \u2705. THREE SAFE MOVES, TWO APPLES! SOLID!\n- **LEFT to (0,7)**: No apple. New body: head at (0,7), then (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). Next turn from (0,7), safe moves? UP to (0,8) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705, DOWN to (0,6) APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705, LEFT off-board \u274c, RIGHT to (1,7) our neck \u274c. ONLY TWO MOVES, BOTH APPLES! BUT WE'RE TRAPPED ON THE LEFT WALL! \ud83d\ude2c\n- **RIGHT to (2,7)**: No apple. New body: head at (2,7), then (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). Next turn from (2,7), safe moves? UP to (2,8) our body? Wait, (2,8) is in our new body? Let's check: new body is (2,7) head, (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). So (2,8) is NOT in our body! It's empty '.' \u2705. DOWN to (2,6) empty '.' \u2705, LEFT to (1,7) our neck \u274c, RIGHT to (3,7) empty '.' \u2705. THREE SAFE MOVES! GOOD FLEXIBILITY!\n\nSTRATEGY: ENEMY IS ABOUT TO BE LENGTH 7! WE'RE STILL 5! WE NEED TO GROW ASAP TO CATCH UP! BUT WE CAN'T GET TRAPPED!\n\nLEFT to (0,7) gives us two apple options next turn, but we're stuck on the wall with only two exits \u2014 RISKY if enemy tries to box us in! RIGHT to (2,7) keeps us central with options. DOWN to (1,6) also gives us two apples next turn AND keeps us away from the wall!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to target the cluster of apples on the left side \u2014 (0,6), (0,8), (1,5). Going DOWN to (1,6) sets up to grab (1,5) or (0,6) next turn! That's GROWTH! Going RIGHT moves us toward center but away from immediate apples. We need to close the apple gap!\n\nENEMY WILL BE AT (6,5) or (7,4) after eating. They'll be long and maybe start cutting off the board. We need to claim our territory on the left!\n\nDECISION: DOWN to (1,6) sets up for DOUBLE APPLE OPTIONS next turn, keeps us off the wall, and maintains flexibility! LEFT is too trapping. RIGHT is safe but delays growth. WE NEED THAT APPLE CONTENT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",

CAN'T REACH THEM DIRECTLY YET. OTHER APPLES: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) NEAR CENTER-LEFT. GOING RIGHT TO (1,4) PUTS US CLOSER TO THOSE! ENEMY IS ON RIGHT SIDE, WE CAN SWEEP LEFT-SIDE APPLES AND GROW WHILE KEEPING DISTANCE.\n\nAGGRESSION CHECK: ENEMY IS LONGER, SO HEAD-ON COLLISION IS BAD FOR US. AVOID DIRECT CONFRONTATION UNTIL WE MATCH LENGTH. RIGHT NOW, MANEUVER AND GROW!\n\nCHAT, I'M LEANING **RIGHT**! GETS US OFF THE WALL, MORE ROOM TO DANCE, AND HEADS TOWARD APPLES IN COLUMNS 3-4!

Wait check length: they had 10 apples, so length 11? Let's count: head (7,5) + 10 body segments = 11 total. Their listed body: [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)] \u2014 that's 10 segments. So full snake: head (7,5) + those 10 = length 11.

WE HAVE LENGTH 8 AFTER EATING? Wait, we have 7 apples = length 8. They have 10 apples = length 11. THEY WIN! WE DIE! \u274c\u274c\u274c THAT'S BAD! SO UP IS RISKY IF THEY GO DOWN!\n\nIF WE GO **RIGHT** TO (8,3) AND EAT APPLE, WE GROW TO LENGTH 9. ENEMY COULD GO RIGHT TO (8,5) \u2014 NO COLLISION.

THAT'S OKAY.\n\nWHAT'S OUR LONG-TERM PLAN? BOX THEM IN! ENEMY IS IN TOP-RIGHT CORNER WITH BODY COILED. OUR BODY FORMS A WALL ALONG ROW 3 FROM (2,3) TO (6,3). IF WE GO **DOWN** TO (7,2), WE EXTEND THAT WALL SOUTH? NOT REALLY \u2014 WE'D BE BELOW ROW 3. BUT WE'D BE FURTHER FROM ENEMY. IF WE GO **UP** TO (7,4), WE'RE CLOSER \u2014 BUT RISKY.\n\nBEST MOVE: **RIGHT** TO (8,3) TO EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e WE GROW TO 9 LENGTH, CLOSING THE GAP! AND FROM (8,3) NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (8,4) TO THREATEN THEIR EASTERN FLANK! ENEMY LIKELY TO GO DOWN TO (7,4) TO CHASE US? OR LEFT/RIGHT? THEY MIGHT AVOID HEAD-ON TOO. IF THEY GO DOWN TO (7,4) AND WE GO RIGHT TO (8,3), NO COLLISION. SAFE.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 IF THEY GO DOWN TO (7,4) AND WE GO UP TO (7,4) \u2192 COLLISION. SO WE JUST WON'T GO UP! WE'LL GO RIGHT! AVOID THE GAMBLE!\n\nNEXT TURN PLAN: FROM (8,3) WITH LENGTH 9, MOVE UP TO (8,4) TO POSITION NEAR ENEMY'S POSSIBLE LOCATION (8,5) OR (7,4). USE OUR BODY TO BLOCK ESCAPE PATHS SOUTH (OUR BODY AT ROW 3) AND EAST (WE'LL BE AT COLUMN 8). SQUEEZE THEM INTO TOP-RIGHT CORNER!
