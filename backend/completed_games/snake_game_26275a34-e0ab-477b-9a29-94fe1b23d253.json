Moving towards that apple could be risky as the enemy snake might get there first.\n\nThe apples at (2, 8) and (2, 7) seem like safer options for now, as they are farther away from the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for this turn will be to move towards the apples at (2, 8) and (2, 7) while avoiding getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nTo move towards those apples, I should decrease my x coordinate and increase my y coordinate.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Since the closest apple is at (5, 5), we can move towards it.\n\nNext move: UP (towards (5, 4))"
