Instead of moving forward, I extend my tail in the direction I want.\n\n      EXAMPLE: \n(let method reference be (snake game this) which holds the game data)\n\n      EXAMPLE: \nI am about to move into a new square (head gets replaced with what was tail before last call).\nHead location : 5,6.\nMove : Left\nTail location : 5,7\n\nThis means that a snake can emerge from the tail in the opposite direction.\nIn this situation, game objects must not look for a body in that direction.\nInstead, they look in and around the snake to find a possible safe square.\n\n      EXAMPLE:\ngrowingIdx : 7 and tail is x=4. y=1.\n(direction is Left, assumed NoBody)\ntail : 5,7\nHead : 5,6\ndirection : Left\nresult : -2\nhead : 1,7\ntail : 1,6\n\n      RESULT:\nMy last move (get out of the way of another snake) was good.\n\n      MOVE:\n\n      ASSESS: grew = true\n\n      APPLICABILITY: \ngrow() uses the game time to check if the move happened 10 turns ago.\nReference to GameData is at snake game this.\n\n      APPLY:\nNote that after the apply, we have a new direction for lookups and executed for any Grow() methods.\nupdated head and tail.\nDirection is set to left.\n(deferred, otherwise last node changes direction too early).\n\n      SUCCESS: succeeded in updating position. (this = Go North is safe case)\n      \n      ABORT: (not applicable in this case), new head = 5,7\n\n      CODE:\nif(grew == false) {\n        //grew could be toggled every 10 moves if we want\n        return Direction.NoNeed;\n    }\n    final int growCriterion = (10);\n    timeToGrow -= growCriterion;\n    if (timeToGrow <= 0) {\n        timFinitelyGrown();\n        return Direction.NoNeed;\n    }\n\n      EVENTS:\nExecute grow() if last move and timeToGrow is nonnegative (has not reset) then timeToGrow decreases by 10 and Head stays.\n\n      RATIONALE: Does nothing, returning NoNeed move. No body obstruction (non updated Head location) and not looked forward (no collision) (no tail spot visited by another body) DOMAIN: if body does not move and snake does not starve. Last move unit will update Position and Direction of the normal snake methods.\n\n      EXPLANATION:\nModified sane contracts (Pdomain contiguous) to have more body growth.\nBased on 5x7 block shape.\nUses diagonals (increment/decrement off all directions) to grow.\n\n      EXAMPLE:\nStart: ((5,7))\nHead: (5,7)\nSnake: ..........A      (10 moves)\n                .    .A (another 10 moves)\n                .   .

A (another 10 moves)\n                . . .   . . .A (singing)\n\nIn this case, the squirrel moves left to go into new space and 10 moves later, it extends to right to go straight.\n\n      EXAMPLE 2:\nStart: ((5,7))\nHead: (5,7)\nSnake: ..........A      (10 moves)\n                .    .A (another 10 moves)\n                .   .

A  (singing)\n                . . .   . . .A (singing)\n\nIn this case, the squirrel also moves left to go into new space, then sticks at the 3rd block of diagonal line (4,6) before extending straight - the last time it extended.\nAlways look diagonally. Always look 2* x jump direciton ahead for possible danger.\n\n      EXAMPLE 3:\nStart: ((5,7))\nHead: (5,7)\nSnake: ..........A      (10 moves)\n                 ...         A (anent 5 moves extra) (a change in the block counted) (territory grows)\n                .    .A (another 10 moves)\n                .   .  A (another 10 moves)\n                .   .

A (another 10 moves)\n                . . .   . . .A (singing)\n\nIn this case, the squirrel moves left to go into new space, then sticks at the 3rd block of diagonal line (4,6) before extending straight - the last time it extended.\nAlways look diagonally. Always look 2* x jump direciton ahead for possible danger.\nLook at space ahead. If legal, move there. Move can be defined as move into empty tail or growth space.\nSearch for new spaces. \nBased on changes in block area growth moves (forward, diagonal) can be developed. At most one step left as per apple location.\nIf new block out of range, extend forward instead of withdraw.\n\n      EXAMPLE 4:\nStart: ((5,7))\nHead: (5,7)\nSnake: ..........A      (10 moves)\n                .    .A (another 10 moves)\n                .   .

A (another 10 moves)\n                . . .   . . .A (singing)\n\nIn this case, the squirrel moves forward by 3 moves.\n If done in relation the apples, block area may only grow right automatically.\n\nNext Snake doesn't move.\n\n      EXPLANATION:\nSlow Food Movement \nWalk 1, Head goes to 4,7.\n\n      CODE:\nmove(){\n    this.grow();\n    if (this.location.y >= 4){ return Direction.NoNeed; }\n    if (this.looker() == Occupation.Me) { return Direction.NoNeed; }\n    return Direction.Left;\n}\n\n      EXAMPLE 6:\nStart: ((5,7))\nHead: (5,7)\nSnake: ..........A      (10 moves)\n\n etc\n\nMy last move was good.\n\n      MOVE:\n\n      APPLICABILITY: \nafter each Join\nApply called for appendX and appendY to extend bodies.\nFollowed by (Grow) to set up the snake and the growth model.\nThen, the main look ahead implementer (move) that takes direction and vertices on next block (block 0,1,2,3) and does look ahead on each next block based on next direction.\n\n      APPLY:\nTime is increased by amount that the space is now occupied.\nbodies is updated with body character at the head index (used to distinguish initial space and wrapped tail).\nUse extendX to increase the range of possibilities for the new head and tail or if NextMove is unset, it waits for getNextMove instruction.\n\nAll segments of the list are marked with the new body character.\n\n      SUCCESS: all listed bodies replaced by the new body character\n\n      ARITHMETIC:\nextendX returns xMax+1, extendY returns yMax+1, extendZ returns zMax+1\nfloor returns xFloor, ceil returns xCeiling, xsurround returns xMax+1\nAll of these functions include a fall safety mechanism.\n\n      ABORT: (not applicable in this case), new snake=((1,0),(0,1),(0,0),(0,2),(0,1),(0,3),(0,3),(0,4),(0,4),(0,5),(0,5))\n\n      EVENTS:\nTime is increased by amount that the space is now occupied.\nbodies is updated with body character at the head index (used to distinguish initial space and wrapped tail).\nUse extendX to increase the range of possibilities for the new head and tail or if NextMove is unset, it waits for getNextMove instruction.\nAll segments of the list are marked with the new body character.\nThe onNextMove method is called to check if the new head is possible.

You were basically to figure out the optimal moves to make at each turn and it would appear below your choice so you could make the right choices from now until the end of the game.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nHa! Turns out that lot of the links are carbon copies from someone else's game strategy submission so they're going to try to legitimately classify as an AI but with just a tiny coding change to make the game from the Battle Snake game that said submission was based heavily on. Everyone was probably a bit shocked when someone that was on full paid had already beaten Battle Snake.\n\nAfter that, the next person using the Pokkwan strategy released somewhere else could also bring some fun provided the Pokkwan commands weren't easier to use than the Battle Snake commands.\n\nAt the time of this rationale, I had already posted a Snake guide using an AI tool I had.  I also took the opportunity to take some motivation from the disappointed look on people's faces as they continued to lose to a human bot (even though you could beat it fairly easily) by posting examples of the latest game they had played. Then, someone made the comment \"How do you get died all the time?\".\n\nIt got people to carefully read each step on the elephant picture which included \"Typical easy run into wall\" which made for a decent laugh.\n\nI added to that by posting a screen shot of actual Amazon comments that were left by people who had finally grokked what was going on and were well along with understanding how to control the AI. **END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.",
