Immediate dangers**  \n- My snake length is 1 (no body yet), so no risk of hitting myself except moving backwards into the nonexistent tail cell (but there\u2019s no tail yet, so backwards is safe for now).  \n- Snake #1 is at (3, 0), far away.  \n- Apples: (2, 8), (0, 5), (7, 1), (2, 2), (0, 3).  \n\n**3. Check each direction for safety**  \n- UP: (1, 3) \u2014 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- DOWN: (1, 1) \u2014 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- LEFT: (0, 2) \u2014 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- RIGHT: (2, 2) \u2014 has an apple! Eating it is safe because no snake body there yet.  \n\n**4. Consider enemy movement**  \nSnake #1 at (3, 0) can move UP to (3, 1), DOWN off board (dies), LEFT to (2, 0), RIGHT to (4, 0).  \nNo risk of head-on collision with me this turn because my possible moves are far from its possible moves except maybe in future turns.  \n\n**5. Strategic choice**  \nRIGHT (2, 2) gets me an apple immediately, growing to length 2. That\u2019s good for score but slightly reduces future mobility because I\u2019ll have a body segment behind me next turn. But early game, eating apples is important.  \n\nLEFT (0, 2) or UP (1, 3) or DOWN (1, 1) are safe but don\u2019t get an apple right away.  \n\nSince all moves are safe, grabbing the apple at (2, 2) seems best \u2014 it\u2019s close and no immediate danger.  \n\n**6. Long-term plan note**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 2), my body will be at (1, 2). Next turn avoid moving back into (1, 2). Possibly move toward other apples like (0, 3) or (0, 5), but watch out for Snake #1\u2019s movements.  \n\nRIGHT",

Actually, I came from (3, 0) to (4, 0) by moving RIGHT, so my body is at (3, 0). That means moving LEFT next turn would go into my body \u2014 so that\u2019s not safe next turn. But I can decide next turn based on board then.  \n\n**Alternative:** If I don\u2019t eat apple now, enemy might later get it, but they\u2019re far.  \n\n**Best move:** RIGHT to (4, 0) to eat apple, gain a point, grow safely.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4, 0) with body at (3, 0), avoid moving LEFT into body. Consider UP to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (5, 0) if safe, to keep moving toward other apples like (7, 1) or (0, 3) depending on enemy position.  \n\nRIGHT",

Immediate dangers**  \n- DOWN is suicide (own body).  \n- Snake #1 head at (3, 0) can move UP (3, 1), DOWN (3, -1) \u2192 off board \u2192 death for Snake #1, so Snake #1 likely won\u2019t choose DOWN unless it\u2019s suicidal, LEFT (2, 0), RIGHT (4, 0).  \n- Snake #1\u2019s possible head moves this turn: (3, 1), (2, 0), (4, 0). None of these overlap with my possible moves (2, 4), (1, 3), (3, 3). So no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**3. Check each safe direction**  \n- UP (2, 4): empty, inside board.  \n- LEFT (1, 3): empty, inside board.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3): empty, inside board.  \nAll three are safe from immediate collision with Snake #1 or myself.  \n\n**4. Apples**  \nApples: (2, 8), (0, 5), (7, 1), (0, 3), (4, 0).  \n- UP moves toward apple at (2, 8) vertically.  \n- LEFT moves toward apple at (0, 5) and (0, 3).  \n- RIGHT moves toward apple at (4, 0) but that\u2019s far away.  \nClosest apples: (0, 3) is 3 moves away (left then down), (2, 8) is 4 moves away (straight up), (0, 5) is 5 moves away.  \n\n**5. Future options**  \nAfter moving:  \n- If UP to (2, 4): next turn body = [(2, 4), (2, 3)], possible moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT except (2, 3).  \n- If LEFT to (1, 3): next turn body = [(1, 3), (2, 3)], possible moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT except (2, 3).  \n- If RIGHT to (3, 3): next turn body = [(3, 3), (2, 3)], possible moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT except (2, 3).  \n\nAll three keep similar future flexibility.  \n\n**6. Strategy note for next turns**  \nSnake #1 is at (3, 0) and may go for apple at (4, 0) or (0, 3). I should aim for closest apple: (0, 3) is reachable via LEFT then DOWN. But moving LEFT now might put me closer to Snake #1 if it moves toward (0, 3) too.  \nBetter: Go UP toward (2, 8) \u2014 safer path away from Snake #1 initially.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP is safe and moves toward an apple while avoiding potential confrontation with Snake #1.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nAfter UP to (2, 4), next turn avoid (2, 3) and consider moving toward (2, 8) or (0, 5) depending on Snake #1\u2019s position.

Wait, enemy body is [(4,6), (4,7), (4,8)], so (4,6) is its neck (body segment after head) \u2192 not safe for enemy. RIGHT (6,6) empty.  \nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nWhere could enemy go?  \n- Apple at (9,6) is 4 away from enemy.  \n- Apple at (1,9) is 7 away.  \n- Apple at (0,5) is 5 away.  \n- Apple at (0,3) is 7 away.  \n- Apple at (2,0) is 9 away.  \n\nEnemy might go DOWN toward (2,0) or RIGHT toward (9,6) eventually.  \n\nDistance to me: |8-5|+|5-6|=3+1=4. Not immediate collision unless we both move into same cell or adjacent heads move into each other\u2019s next head position.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), enemy could go DOWN to (5,5) or UP to (5,7) \u2014 no risk.  \nIf I go UP to (8,6), enemy could go RIGHT to (6,6) \u2014 no adjacency.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7,5), enemy could go DOWN to (5,5) \u2014 no adjacency.  \n\nNo direct head-on possible this turn because we are 4 apart.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (8,5):  \n- (9,6): distance |1|+|1|=2  \n- (0,5): |8|+|0|=8  \n- (0,3): |8|+|2|=10  \n- (1,9): |7|+|4|=11  \n- (2,0): |6|+|5|=11  \n\nClosest is (9,6) distance 2.\n\nFrom (8,5):  \n- UP (8,6) \u2192 distance to (9,6) = |1|+|0|=1  \n- LEFT (7,5) \u2192 distance = |2|+|1|=3  \n- RIGHT (9,5) \u2192 distance = |0|+|1|=1  \n\nUP and RIGHT both reduce distance to 1.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \nUP to (8,6):  \nNext moves from (8,6): UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5) body, LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6) apple \u2192 3 safe (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nRIGHT to (9,5):  \nNext moves from (9,5): UP (9,6) apple, DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5) body, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 safe (UP, DOWN).  \n\nLEFT to (7,5):  \nNext moves from (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5) body \u2192 3 safe (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nRIGHT again reduces future options because board edge.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of corner trap:**  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (9,5), then next turn I could eat apple at (9,6) by going UP, but then I\u2019m at (9,6) with only LEFT (8,6) as exit \u2014 risky if enemy approaches.  \nBetter to approach (9,6) from left side: go UP now to (8,6), then RIGHT to (9,6) next turn, eat it, then next turn after eating I can go LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5) depending on safety.  \n\nAlso, enemy at (5,6) could move toward (9,6) over next few turns \u2014 if I\u2019m already near it, I can grab it first.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAim to eat (9,6) in 2 turns via (8,6)\u2192(9,6). After eating, move away from corner immediately. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s movement toward that apple. If enemy heads this way, maybe abandon and go for (0,5) or (1,9) later. For now, UP is safe and keeps options open.\n\n**Best move:** UP \u2014 moves toward apple, keeps more future moves, avoids edge trap.\n\nUP",

If I go LEFT and enemy goes RIGHT, we both die and I lose because enemy has more apples (3 vs my 2).

After eating, I can move UP to (9,7) or DOWN to (9,5) next turn. Enemy might move toward other apples. Being longer reduces risk of head-on collisions slightly.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s possible moves, RIGHT seems safe this turn and secures apple.

Actually, next turn snake #1\u2019s body will be [(8, 6), (8, 5)] if it moves away from (8, 6), so (8, 6) might be body segment next turn \u2192 unsafe. So from (7, 6), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT? Check RIGHT: (8, 6) will be snake #1 body segment next turn \u2192 unsafe. So safe moves: UP, DOWN \u2014 only 2 safe moves.  \n\nRIGHT reduces future safe moves to 2 and risks collision now.\n\n**6. Decision**  \nUP or DOWN are equally safe regarding collisions and future mobility.  \nApple at (9, 6) is to the right/up, so UP moves me closer while avoiding risk.  \nDOWN moves me away from apples but keeps options open.  \nGiven my lead (3 apples vs 2), I should play safe and move toward apples without risking death.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (6, 7), consider moving rightward toward (9, 6) apple cautiously, watching snake #1\u2019s position.

If enemy moves UP to (5,9), then new body will be [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)]? Wait, growth only if they eat an apple.

If enemy goes UP to (5,9), they are closer to apple (1,9). I should maybe move toward central area to have options later. UP to (8,8) keeps me near top right, but gives 3 safe moves next turn. LEFT to (7,7) reduces future options.  \n\nGiven that I want to avoid being trapped, UP seems better for keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (8,8), I\u2019ll have UP/LEFT/RIGHT safe next turn. From there, I can consider moving toward (8,0) by going LEFT then DOWN over several turns, or toward (1,9) if enemy doesn\u2019t take it. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path to avoid collisions.\n\nUP\n\nLEFT",

Also edge risk.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nDOWN gives apple now but reduces next turn\u2019s safe moves to 2 (edge).  \nLEFT gives no apple now but keeps 3 safe moves and stays central.  \nRIGHT gives no apple and also only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nGiven enemy is far and I\u2019m behind in apples (3 vs 4), taking the apple now is tempting. But being on (8, 0) next turn with only LEFT/RIGHT could be dangerous if enemy approaches later. However, enemy is far and apples at (2,0) and (3,1) are near my area after eating (8,0).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nIf I take apple (8,0), next turn I must move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid dying. Prefer LEFT toward (3,1) apple area. Enemy may go for (0,5) or (0,3). Keep distance. If I skip apple now, I can go LEFT to (7,1) and then maybe DOWN to (7,0) next turn to get apple (8,0) later while keeping more options. But enemy could take (8,0) if they come down? Unlikely this turn given their position.  \n\nActually, if I go LEFT now to (7,1), apple (8,0) is still there next turn and I can go DOWN to (7,0) then RIGHT to (8,0) the following turn, or go DOWN next turn directly if safe. This keeps flexibility.  \n\nGiven the edge risk after eating apple now, and since I have time, I\u2019ll choose safety and flexibility: go LEFT now, then reassess.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,1), consider moving DOWN to (7,0) to approach apple (8,0) or LEFT toward center. Monitor enemy movement toward (0,5)/(0,3). Avoid getting trapped near bottom edge after growing.\n\nLEFT",

Actually from (7,1): DOWN to (7,0) then RIGHT to (8,0) = 2 moves).  \n- (3,1) distance 4 (left 4 steps).  \n- (2,0) distance |7-2|+|1-0|=5+1=6.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (7,2):**  \nFrom (7,2) next turn:  \n- UP (7,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (7,1) \u2013 my old head (body) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (6,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,2) \u2013 my body (segment 3) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Edge risk? Not on edge but limited.\n\n**DOWN to (7,0):**  \nFrom (7,0) next turn:  \n- UP (7,1) \u2013 my old head (body) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (7,-1) \u2013 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (6,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,0) \u2013 apple, not occupied.  \nSo 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). On bottom edge, but RIGHT gets apple next turn.\n\n**LEFT to (6,1):**  \nFrom (6,1) next turn:  \n- UP (6,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (6,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (5,1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,1) \u2013 my old head (body) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good flexibility, moves toward center.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting vs safety:**  \nDOWN to (7,0) sets up to eat (8,0) next turn (if enemy doesn\u2019t take it first).  \nLEFT to (6,1) keeps more options open and moves toward (3,1) apple area.  \nUP to (7,2) moves away from most apples, fewer next moves.\n\nEnemy might go for (0,5) apple this turn, increasing its lead to 5 apples vs my 3.  \nIf I go LEFT, I\u2019m not gaining an apple immediately, but I stay safe and can plan for (3,1) or (2,0).  \nIf I go DOWN, I\u2019m closer to (8,0) but risk being on bottom edge with only 2 moves next turn. However, enemy is far, so likely safe to grab (8,0) next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (3 vs 4). Need to start catching up.  \n(8,0) is the nearest apple. Going DOWN now puts me adjacent to it, so next turn I can move RIGHT onto it. That gives me apple next turn and grows to length 5.  \nRisk: being on bottom edge with only LEFT/RIGHT next turn after eating apple (8,0) \u2014 but after eating, my tail will move, so from (8,0) my body will be [(8,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)]? Wait, careful:  \nCurrent: head (7,1), body segments: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3).  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,0) now, new head (7,0), body becomes [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)] \u2014 tail (8,3) moves off? No, growth only happens when eating apple. So length stays 4, tail moves to (8,2)? Actually:  \nSnake moves: head to (7,0), segment 2 (old head) becomes new segment 2 at (7,1), segment 3 moves to (8,1), segment 4 (old tail) moves to (8,2). So body: [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)].  \nThen next turn if I go RIGHT to (8,0) and eat apple, I grow: new head (8,0), body: [(8,0), (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)] length 5.  \n\nFrom (8,0) after eating, next turn options:  \n- UP (8,1) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (8,-1) \u2013 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (7,0) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (9,0) \u2013 empty.  \nSo only RIGHT is safe \u2014 that\u2019s risky (dead end if enemy approaches later).  \n\nTherefore, going DOWN now to (7,0) commits me to eating (8,0) next turn, which then traps me on bottom-right corner with only RIGHT move. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBetter to go LEFT to (6,1) \u2014 keeps options open, moves toward center and other apples (3,1) and (2,0). Enemy likely takes (0,5) apple, increasing lead to 5, but I can target (3,1) soon.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nSafety first: LEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn, avoids edge trap.  \nI\u2019ll go LEFT now, then next turn from (6,1) I can go DOWN to (6,0) and approach (8,0) or (2,0) while keeping flexibility.  \n\nLEFT",

Eating apple is priority for score and survival (longer snake can be advantageous if managed well).\n\n**5. Decision**  \nBoth moves safe. DOWN gets apple and score, but slightly reduces mobility next turn (2 moves). RIGHT keeps mobility high but delays apple.  \nGiven the goal to collect apples and win by reaching 30 apples, DOWN is better \u2014 immediate growth.

Wait: tail is at (6,1) now, next turn tail moves forward one cell to (3,1) because we grew last turn, so (2,0) becomes body segment next turn) \u2192 Actually, next turn (2,0) will be my body, so RIGHT from (1,0) is invalid. So from (1,0) next turn only UP and LEFT are safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3,0):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn from (3,0): UP (3,1) my body (segment (3,1) currently, but tail moves forward, so (3,1) will still be body next turn) \u2192 invalid. DOWN off board, LEFT (2,0) my body, RIGHT (4,0) empty. So only RIGHT is safe next turn \u2014 very limited.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider apple proximity and future mobility:**  \nApples: (8,0) far right bottom, (5,3) closer, (7,2) mid-right, (2,8) top, (8,6) far top-right.  \nEnemy is near (2,8) apple \u2014 might go UP toward it.  \n\nFrom (1,0): I can go UP to (1,1) next, then toward (5,3) or (7,2).  \nFrom (3,0): only RIGHT to (4,0) next, then maybe up toward (5,3).  \n\nLEFT gives more options next turn (2 safe moves vs 1 safe move after RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy and plan:**  \nEnemy length 7 vs my 5 \u2014 avoid confrontation.  \nEnemy likely heading UP for (2,8) apple, so less immediate threat to me in bottom left.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility: LEFT to (1,0) now, then next turn go UP to (1,1) to open more space and move toward center/apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,0), go UP to (1,1) unless enemy blocks. Then aim for (5,3) or (7,2) via safe path, avoiding enemy\u2019s possible descent. Keep distance from enemy head, prioritize mobility over immediate apple unless apple is very safe.  \n\nLEFT",

So body segments: (2, 3) becomes neck, (1, 3) still there, so DOWN from (1, 4) would go to (1, 3) \u2014 body segment \u2014 death. So LEFT now reduces future options because DOWN blocked next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT is worse for mobility.  \n\n**Best choice:** RIGHT gets me closer to apple (5, 3) and keeps all options open next turn. UP also safe but slightly farther from nearest apple.  \n\nRIGHT\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT to (3, 4), aim for apple at (5, 3).

That puts it closer to me if I go RIGHT to (5, 2) \u2014 but still 2 cells away horizontally.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 3), it\u2019s moving toward apples (8, 6) or (8, 7).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (7, 4), it\u2019s moving toward (2, 8) apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI want to stay safe but also progress toward an apple.  \nRIGHT to (5, 2) moves toward (7, 2) but enemy might eat it this turn, so maybe not worth the risk.  \nUP to (4, 3) moves toward center, keeps options open, and avoids potential conflict if enemy goes DOWN to (7, 2).  \nDOWN to (4, 1) is safe but delays apple collection.\n\nGiven enemy is longer, I should avoid direct competition for the same apple if enemy can reach it first.  \nApple (2, 8) is far but reachable via moving up through center.  \nApple (8, 0) is far down-right.\n\nBetter to go UP to (4, 3) \u2014 opens path to (2, 8) or (8, 6) later, and keeps distance from enemy\u2019s likely DOWN move.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 3), check enemy\u2019s new head. If enemy ate (7, 2), it will be longer; avoid getting trapped. Consider moving toward (2, 8) via (3, 3) or (4, 4) if safe. Keep escape routes open.\n\nUP",

Therefore UP to (4,4) and RIGHT to (5,3) are unsafe now.

          "rationale": "**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (3,3):**  \nCurrent board:  \n- UP (3,4): enemy body (3,4) now \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3,2): my body (3,2) now \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (2,3): enemy body (2,3) now \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4,3): my body (4,3) now \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nAll four moves currently occupied. But snakes move simultaneously, so enemy may vacate (3,4) or (2,3) this turn. I must check if enemy could move into those cells instead.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (8,2):**  \nEnemy body: [(7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)]  \nPossible moves from (8,2):  \n- UP (8,3): empty.  \n- DOWN (8,1): empty.  \n- LEFT (7,2): own body \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT (9,2): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \nEnemy will not stay in (7,2) because that\u2019s its neck.  \nThus enemy will vacate (7,2), (7,3), etc. but (3,4) and (2,3) are far behind enemy head; they will remain occupied this turn because snake segments shift forward only if head moves into apple. Enemy has 9 apples, length 10, so no growth unless it eats apple this turn.  \nTherefore (3,4) and (2,3) remain enemy body this turn \u2192 LEFT and UP unsafe.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check my own body shift:**  \nIf I don\u2019t eat apple, my tail (1,1) moves off, body shifts: head moves, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position.  \nSo after my move:  \nBody will be: new head at chosen direction, then (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) \u2014 tail (1,1) gone.  \nThus (4,3) becomes my second segment next turn, so RIGHT into (4,3) is unsafe now (my own body currently there).  \nDOWN into (3,2) is unsafe now (my body there now).  \n\nSo all four moves are unsafe based on *current* board. But simultaneous movement means I can move into a cell that is currently occupied by enemy body **only if** enemy head moves away from that cell and the segment there moves out this turn.  \nBut enemy\u2019s tail is at (2,3)? Wait, enemy length 10: head (8,2), then 9 body segments ending at (2,3)? Let\u2019s trace:  \n(8,2) head \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) tail. Yes, tail is (2,3).  \nSo (2,3) is enemy tail. If enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple, (2,3) becomes empty after enemy moves.  \nSimilarly (3,4) is not tail; it\u2019s 2nd from tail, so it shifts to (2,4) if enemy moves without eating.  \n\nThus:  \n- LEFT to (2,3): currently enemy tail. If enemy moves without eating, (2,3) vacates. But enemy could eat apple at (8,6) or (8,7) or (8,0) \u2014 unlikely to reach in one move. So (2,3) likely empty after enemy move.  \n- UP to (3,4): currently enemy body, will shift to (2,4) if enemy moves without eating, so (3,4) could become empty.  \n\nSo both LEFT and UP could become safe after enemy movement.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy possible heads: (8,3), (8,1), (9,2).  \nMy possible moves:  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,3), enemy heads far away \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go UP to (3,4), enemy heads far away \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4,3) or DOWN to (3,2), my own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo possible safe moves after considering simultaneous movement: LEFT and UP.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose between LEFT and UP:**  \nLEFT (2,3): gets me closer to apple (3,0) and (2,8).  \nUP (3,4): gets me closer to apple (2,8) but into area near enemy body.  \nFrom (2,3) next turn, possible moves: UP (2,4) currently enemy body (will shift), DOWN (2,2) my body, LEFT (1,3) currently empty, RIGHT (3,3) my body. So maybe 1 safe move next turn.  \nFrom (3,4) next turn: UP (3,5) empty, DOWN (3,3) my body, LEFT (2,4) enemy body (maybe), RIGHT (4,4) enemy body. Possibly only UP safe.  \n\nBoth are risky for next turn, but LEFT seems slightly better because it\u2019s enemy tail now, so less chance enemy lingers there. Also apple (3,0) is closer from (2,3) via DOWN later.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nMove LEFT to (2,3) this turn. Next turn, if (2,4) is enemy body, avoid UP; go LEFT to (1,3) if safe, then down toward (3,0) apple. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, enemy tail is (2, 4) currently? Let\u2019s check: enemy body list: head (8, 1), then (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4) \u2192 length 10, so tail is (2, 4), not (2, 3). My earlier last-move rationale incorrectly said tail at (2, 3) \u2014 that was wrong.  \n\nSo enemy tail is (2, 4). If enemy moves without eating, (2, 4) vacates, all segments shift forward. Then (3, 4) becomes (2, 4), (4, 4) becomes (3, 4), etc.  \n\nThus after enemy move without eating:  \n- (2, 4) becomes empty (old tail vacated).  \n- (3, 4) becomes enemy body (shifted from (4, 4)).  \n\nIf enemy eats apple, tail stays at (2, 4), so (2, 4) remains enemy body, and new segment added after head.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 My body shift after move:**  \nMy body: head (2, 3), then (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2) \u2192 length 6, apples 5 \u2192 no growth unless I eat apple.  \nIf I move without eating, my tail (2, 2) vacates, body shifts: new head at chosen direction, then (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2).  \n\nSo:  \n- If I go LEFT to (1, 3): new head (1, 3), then (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2) \u2192 tail (2, 2) gone.  \n- If I go UP to (2, 4): new head (2, 4), then (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2) \u2192 tail (2, 2) gone.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety after simultaneous move:**  \n\n**LEFT (1, 3):**  \nCurrently empty. After enemy move:  \n- Enemy head could be at (8, 0), (7, 1), or (9, 1) \u2014 far away.  \n- Enemy body: (2, 4) may or may not be occupied depending on growth. (1, 3) not near enemy body.  \n- My own body after shift: (2, 3) is my second segment, not (1, 3).  \nSo LEFT seems safe.\n\n**UP (2, 4):**  \nCurrently enemy body. After enemy move without eating, (2, 4) becomes empty (tail vacated). But if enemy eats apple at (8, 0), tail stays, so (2, 4) remains enemy body.  \nSo UP is risky \u2014 if enemy eats apple, I die. Enemy is close to apple (8, 0) and might go DOWN to eat it. So UP is unsafe.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT are into my own current body \u2014 unsafe even after shift because those cells become my second segment after I move? Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2): currently my body, after shift my second segment is (2, 3), so (2, 2) is empty \u2014 but wait, simultaneous movement means at move time, (2, 2) is occupied by my body, so I die immediately. So DOWN unsafe.  \nSimilarly RIGHT to (3, 3) currently my body \u2192 unsafe.\n\nSo only possibly safe move is LEFT.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options from (1, 3):**  \nFrom (1, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 4) \u2014 likely empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 2) \u2014 empty now.  \n- LEFT (0, 3) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 3) \u2014 will be my body after this move.  \nSo 3 possible safe moves next turn if no enemy moves into them.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apples:**  \nClosest apple from (1, 3) is (3, 0) \u2014 could go down/right later. Also (2, 8) is far but reachable.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Head-on collision check:**  \nEnemy possible heads: (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 1). My move to (1, 3) far away \u2192 safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLEFT is the only clearly safe move. UP is risky if enemy eats apple. DOWN/RIGHT suicide.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (1, 3), move toward (3, 0) apple via DOWN then RIGHT, avoiding enemy head area (bottom right). Keep distance from enemy, who is longer and could cut me off. Try to collect apples while staying in open spaces.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, enemy tail is (3, 4), not (2, 4). Actually (2, 4) is currently empty. Yes, (2, 4) empty now and after enemy move still empty unless enemy head goes there, impossible this turn. So from (1, 4), 3 safe moves next turn likely.  \n\nFrom (1, 2): UP (1, 3) (my body after move), DOWN (1, 1) empty, LEFT (0, 2) empty, RIGHT (2, 2) empty (currently my tail but vacates after move). So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (0, 3): UP (0, 4) empty, DOWN (0, 2) empty, LEFT (-1, 3) off-board \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (1, 3) my body after move. So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\nSo LEFT leads to fewer future options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (8, 0), (8, 6), (2, 8), (8, 7), (3, 0).  \nFrom (1, 3):  \n- UP/DOWN/LEFT none directly on apple.  \nClosest apple is (3, 0) at distance |3-1|+|0-3|=5.  \nFrom (1, 2) distance to (3, 0) = |2|+|2|=4.  \nFrom (1, 4) distance to (3, 0) = |2|+|4|=6.  \nFrom (0, 3) distance to (3, 0) = |3|+|3|=6.  \n\nSo DOWN gets me slightly closer to (3, 0).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy possible heads after move: (7, 0) or (6, 1). My possible heads (1, 4), (1, 2), (0, 3) all far away \u2192 safe.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (10 vs my 6) and has more apples (9 vs 5). Need to collect apples while avoiding being trapped. (3, 0) is closest apple, but enemy is far from it. Moving DOWN to (1, 2) sets up to go RIGHT to (2, 2) then (3, 2) then (3, 1) then (3, 0) \u2014 but need to check if (2, 2) is safe next turn: after this move, my body will be (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), so (2, 2) empty.  \n\nAlso, (8, 0) apple is near enemy head \u2014 enemy might go for it if they go DOWN to (7, 0) then RIGHT to (8, 0) next turn. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll avoid that area.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT (0, 3) reduces future options.  \nUP (1, 4) moves away from closest apple.  \nDOWN (1, 2) moves toward closest apple, keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nDOWN seems best for apple collection and maintaining flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), consider moving RIGHT toward (3, 0) if safe, but check enemy\u2019s new position first. Avoid moving into (2, 2) if enemy could cut off.  \n\nDOWN",

My body after shift: head (2, 2), then (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) \u2192 tail (3, 3) vacates. No self-collision. Safe.  \n- DOWN (2, 0): enemy cannot reach (2, 0) in one move. My body after shift: head (2, 0), then (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) \u2192 tail (3, 3) vacates. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 1): enemy could move LEFT to (3, 1) \u2192 head-on collision risk. If enemy chooses LEFT, we both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky if enemy goes LEFT. UP and DOWN are safe regardless.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options from each safe move:**  \nFrom (2, 2):  \n- UP (2, 3): my body after move (old (2, 3) becomes (1, 3) after shift? Let\u2019s check: after moving to (2, 2), body becomes [(2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]. So (2, 3) is occupied by tail. So UP into tail \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (2, 1): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1, 2): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2): empty.  \nOnly 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s too few \u2014 risky.\n\nFrom (2, 0):  \n- UP (2, 1): occupied by my body after shift \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (2, -1): off-board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 0): empty (and apple at (3, 0)!).  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT), one leads to apple.\n\nFrom (3, 1) if safe:  \n- UP (3, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN (3, 0): apple, empty now.  \n- LEFT (2, 1): my body after shift \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1): enemy head now? Actually enemy might move away, but (4, 1) could be empty if enemy moves. But if enemy stays there? Let\u2019s not rely on that. Still, 2 safe moves likely. But RIGHT is risky this turn due to head-on.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (8, 0), (8, 6), (2, 8), (8, 7), (3, 0).  \nFrom (2, 0): distance to (3, 0) = 1.  \nFrom (2, 2): distance to (3, 0) = 3.  \nFrom (3, 1): distance to (3, 0) = 1.  \n\nDOWN puts me adjacent to apple (3, 0) with safe moves next turn to eat it (RIGHT into apple). UP moves away from closest apple.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy possible heads: (4, 2), (4, 0), (3, 1).  \nMy DOWN \u2192 (2, 0): safe from all.  \nMy RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1): collides if enemy goes LEFT.  \nMy UP \u2192 (2, 2): safe.\n\nSo DOWN is safest.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (10 vs my 6), so avoid confrontation.  \nApple at (3, 0) is reachable next turn from (2, 0) via RIGHT.  \nFrom (2, 0), I have LEFT and RIGHT next turn; LEFT goes to (1, 0) which is safe unless enemy moves there, but enemy is at (4, 1) now, unlikely.  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 0), I\u2019ll grow to length 7, still shorter than enemy.  \nKeep moving toward apples in lower half, maybe aim for (8, 0) later, but avoid enemy path near top.\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives safety, adjacency to apple, and avoids head-on risk.  \n\nDOWN",

Avoid LEFT due to collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4, 0) after DOWN, grab (3, 0) apple next turn if safe, then maneuver toward left side to avoid getting trapped by enemy.

My body after shift: head (1, 0), then (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) \u2192 tail (2, 3) vacates. No self-collision. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 0): enemy could move LEFT to (3, 0) \u2192 head-on collision risk. If enemy chooses LEFT, we both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky if enemy goes LEFT. LEFT is safe regardless.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options from each safe move:**  \nFrom (1, 0):  \n- UP (1, 1): my body after shift (old (1, 1) becomes (2, 1) after shift? Let\u2019s check: after moving to (1, 0), body becomes [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]. So (1, 1) is occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (1, -1): off-board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (0, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 0): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 1 safe move next turn (LEFT). That\u2019s risky (dead-end if enemy approaches).  \n\nFrom (3, 0) if safe:  \n- UP (3, 1): empty.  \n- DOWN (3, -1): off-board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (2, 0): occupied by my body after shift \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 0): enemy head now? Actually enemy might move away, but (4, 0) could be empty if enemy moves RIGHT. But if enemy stays there? Let\u2019s not rely on that. Still, likely 1 safe move (UP) if enemy leaves (4, 0).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (8, 0), (8, 6), (2, 8), (8, 7), (3, 0).  \nFrom (1, 0): distance to (3, 0) = 2, to (8, 0) = 7.  \nFrom (3, 0): on apple \u2192 eat immediately if move there safely.  \n\nBut RIGHT risks head-on collision with enemy moving LEFT. Enemy length 10 vs my 6, so enemy might avoid head-on if they see risk? Possibly, but they might also go for apple. Safer to avoid gamble.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy possible heads: (3, 0) if LEFT, (5, 0) if RIGHT.  \nMy LEFT \u2192 (1, 0): safe from both.  \nMy RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0): collides if enemy goes LEFT.  \n\nSo LEFT is safest.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer, so avoid confrontation.  \nApple at (3, 0) is tempting but too risky.  \nFrom (1, 0), only safe move next turn is LEFT to (0, 0), then I\u2019ll be in bottom-left corner with limited exits. That\u2019s dangerous.  \nBut maybe enemy will move RIGHT to (5, 0) and I can later go UP from (1, 0) after body shifts? Let\u2019s check: after moving LEFT to (1, 0), next turn body becomes [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]. Then UP (1, 1) is occupied, so still only LEFT safe. So corner trap.  \n\nMaybe I should consider if UP from (2, 0) was safe? No, UP was into my body at (2, 1) \u2192 unsafe. So only LEFT and RIGHT were initially safe, and RIGHT is risky.  \n\nGiven the corner trap from LEFT, maybe RIGHT is worth the risk if enemy is likely to avoid LEFT? Let\u2019s check enemy incentives:  \nEnemy at (4, 0):  \n- LEFT (3, 0): apple, but sees my head at (2, 0) possibly moving RIGHT \u2192 head-on risk for them too (they die if we collide). They might avoid it.  \n- RIGHT (5, 0): safe, no apple.  \nEnemy might choose RIGHT to avoid risk, especially since they\u2019re longer and winning.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT, my RIGHT is safe and I eat apple.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take the calculated risk: enemy likely avoids head-on when they\u2019re ahead. RIGHT gets apple, grows to length 7, and from (3, 0) next turn I can go UP to (3, 1) which is empty and gives more options.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (3, 0), go UP to (3, 1) if safe, then consider moving toward (8, 0) along bottom row while avoiding enemy. Keep distance from enemy\u2019s longer body.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 possible moves from (2, 0):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 1): its own body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, -1): off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 0): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0): apple present, safe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**3. Collision risk this turn:**  \nMy LEFT (3, 0): enemy RIGHT (3, 0) \u2192 head-on collision possible \u2192 deadly.  \nMy RIGHT (5, 0): enemy cannot reach (5, 0) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nSo LEFT is risky because enemy might go RIGHT into (3, 0) simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \nLEFT (3, 0): apple there \u2192 eat and grow.  \nRIGHT (5, 0): no apple, but safe from collision.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nAfter LEFT (3, 0) if enemy not there:  \nPossible moves from (3, 0): UP (3, 1) empty, DOWN off board death, LEFT (2, 0) enemy head currently there but enemy will move, RIGHT (4, 0) neck \u2192 death \u2192 1 safe move UP unless enemy leaves (2, 0) allowing LEFT next turn.\n\nAfter RIGHT (5, 0):  \nPossible moves from (5, 0): UP (5, 1) body segment death, DOWN off board death, LEFT (4, 0) neck death, RIGHT (6, 0) empty \u2192 only 1 safe move RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**6. Risk assessment:**  \nLEFT has immediate head-on collision risk with enemy. Since I\u2019m longer (9 apples vs 5), I win ties in head-on? Actually no \u2014 head-on collision kills both. That\u2019s bad because I\u2019m ahead. Avoid LEFT.\n\nRIGHT is safe this turn but leaves only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT again to (6, 0)), which could lead to a dead-end.\n\n---\n\n**7. Strategy:**  \nEven though LEFT gets an apple, the collision risk is too high. Enemy has only two moves: LEFT (1, 0) or RIGHT (3, 0). If they go RIGHT, we both die. Since I\u2019m leading, I should avoid that.\n\nRIGHT is safe this turn, but I must plan next turn: from (5, 0) only RIGHT to (6, 0) is safe. Then from (6, 0): UP (6, 1) body death, DOWN off board death, LEFT (5, 0) neck death, RIGHT (7, 0) empty \u2192 again only RIGHT safe. This leads me along bottom edge toward (8, 0) apple eventually, but very constrained.\n\nMaybe enemy will eat (3, 0) apple if they go RIGHT, but that\u2019s better than me dying.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (5, 0) after RIGHT, next turn go RIGHT to (6, 0), then RIGHT to (7, 0), then RIGHT to (8, 0) to eat apple there. This path is safe if enemy doesn\u2019t block. After eating (8, 0), I\u2019ll have more flexibility to go UP from (8, 0) to (8, 1) \u2014 but (8, 1) is my body now, so need to check future body positions as I move.\n\nBetter to survive this turn, avoid collision, and snake along bottom to (8, 0) apple.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Either way, no collision risk for me at (7, 0).\n\n---\n\n**3. Next turn from (7, 0):**  \nPossible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 1): body segment \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 0): neck \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 0): apple!  \n\nSo again only RIGHT safe next turn. That\u2019s fine \u2014 apple at (8, 0) is reachable in one move after this.\n\n---\n\n**4. After eating apple at (8, 0):**  \nMy tail will be at (7, 2) now, but when I move to (8, 0) and eat, I grow by 1, so tail stays at (7, 2).  \nFrom (8, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 1): body segment \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 0): neck \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n\nThat\u2019s a problem \u2014 eating the apple at (8, 0) traps me with no safe moves next turn unless my tail moves first.\n\nBut wait \u2014 my tail will move one step forward each turn. Let\u2019s simulate:\n\nCurrent turn: move RIGHT to (7, 0). Tail moves from (7, 2) to (8, 2)? Actually, tail movement: body segments shift forward when head moves. Let\u2019s track:\n\nCurrent body length = 9 segments + head = total length 10. After eating apple at (8, 0), length becomes 11, so tail doesn\u2019t move that turn.  \n\nBut before eating apple:  \nTurn 47: head to (7, 0), tail from (7, 2) to (8, 2)? Let\u2019s check body list shift:  \nBody was: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (7, 2)]  \nHead moves to (7, 0), new body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)]  \nTail is now (8, 2), old tail (7, 2) gone.\n\nTurn 48: head to (8, 0), eat apple \u2192 body length increases by 1, new body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)]  \nFrom (8, 0): UP (8, 1) body segment death, DOWN off board, LEFT neck, RIGHT off board \u2192 still trapped!  \n\nSo eating (8, 0) kills me next turn unless tail moves out of (8, 1) before I need to go there. But tail is at (8, 2) when I\u2019m at (8, 0), so to free up (8, 1), I\u2019d need to wait a turn \u2014 but I can\u2019t, because I\u2019ll have no safe moves at (8, 0).\n\nConclusion: Apple at (8, 0) is a trap \u2014 eating it kills me next turn.\n\n---\n\n**5. Alternative plan:**  \nOnly move is RIGHT to (7, 0). Then next turn I must go RIGHT to (8, 0) because no other move. But then I die the turn after unless something changes.\n\nActually, check: from (7, 0) next turn, could enemy or something else change the board? No.  \n\nBut maybe I can avoid eating apple? If I reach (8, 0) without eating, I die immediately (off board to right, neck to left, body up, board down). So I must eat it to stay alive that turn, but then next turn no moves.\n\nSo my only path leads to death in 2 turns.\n\n---\n\n**6. Is there any way out?**  \nWhat if enemy snake #1 moves into my body at (7, 0) or (8, 0)? That would kill them, not me. But they are far away \u2014 they can\u2019t reach (7, 0) in one move from (3, 1).  \n\nSo indeed, I\u2019m trapped in a corridor of my own body with only one move sequence leading to death.\n\nThis means the game might be hopeless \u2014 but maybe I\u2019m missing a body segment shift that frees a space.\n\nLet\u2019s check if UP at (7, 0) next turn could be safe:  \nAt turn 48, body from (7, 0) move:  \nNew body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)]  \nUP to (7, 1) is occupied by (7, 1) in body \u2014 yes death. So no.\n\nSo indeed, dead end.\n\n---\n\n**7. But rules say:** If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you win.  \nIf enemy dies before me, I win immediately. Could enemy die soon?  \nEnemy #1 at (3, 1) has moves UP (3, 2) and RIGHT (4, 1).  \nFrom (3, 2): possible moves? Not trapped yet. They have more space. So they won\u2019t die before me.\n\nThus, I must accept the inevitable: only move is RIGHT, leading to death in 2 turns.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Currently no snake body there.  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (8, 0), body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)].  \nLast turn I predicted enemy would go RIGHT to (8, 0) to eat apple. That happened (see board: apple at (8, 0) is gone, enemy head now at (8, 0) per board state).  \nNow enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8, 0):  \n- UP (8, 1): own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, -1): off-board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (7, 0): own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (9, 0): empty, safe.  \n\nSo enemy will likely go RIGHT to (9, 0) this turn. It will not grow (no apple there), so its tail will move forward one cell (old tail at (8, 2) moves to (8, 1)? Wait, careful: after eating apple last turn, enemy grew by 1, so its length increased by 1 but tail didn\u2019t move last turn. This turn, if it moves to (9, 0) without eating apple, tail will move forward, so the last segment (8, 2) disappears, new body: [(9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)].\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Safety after simultaneous move:**  \nCheck each safe move:  \n- UP to (3, 4): enemy new head (9, 0) far away, no collision with enemy body. Safe.  \n- LEFT to (2, 3): apple there, I\u2019ll grow, enemy far away, safe.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 3): safe from enemy.  \n\nAll three safe.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options from each move:**  \n- UP (3, 4): next moves: UP (3, 5), DOWN (3, 3) (my body after move? Wait, if I move UP, my body becomes [(3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)], so DOWN from (3, 4) goes to (3, 3) which is my neck \u2192 unsafe. LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4) \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n- LEFT (2, 3): eat apple, grow to length 8, body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. Next moves from (2, 3): UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2) (empty? currently my body at (3, 2) but after move, (2, 2) is free), LEFT (1, 3), RIGHT (3, 3) (my neck) \u2192 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT (4, 3): body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. Next moves: UP (4, 4), DOWN (4, 2) (enemy body at (4, 2)? No, enemy body after move will be at (4, 0), (4, 1) etc., but (4, 2) is free), LEFT (3, 3) (my neck), RIGHT (5, 3) \u2192 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nAll three give 3 safe follow-up moves.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple proximity and strategy:**  \nApples: (8, 6), (2, 8), (8, 7), (7, 6).  \nLEFT gets me apple (2, 3) immediately, increasing my length to 8 and score to 7.  \nEnemy is far bottom-right, heading right along bottom row. I should collect apples in top-left area while avoiding being trapped.  \nAfter eating (2, 3), I can go UP toward (2, 8) next turns.  \nUP without eating keeps me safe but delays eating.  \nRIGHT moves me away from most apples.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nIf I eat apple at (2, 3), my length increases, making me slightly less maneuverable but closer to winning by apples. Enemy has 10 apples, I\u2019d have 7. Still need many apples to win, so eating now is good. From (2, 3), I can go UP to (2, 4) then continue toward (2, 8). Need to watch enemy\u2019s path: enemy will likely go up column 9 eventually to get apples at (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 6). That\u2019s far from my planned path.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy moving to (9, 0), far from me. No risk.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT to eat apple, gain score, and still have 3 safe exits next turn.\n\nLEFT",

From last turn\u2019s rationale, enemy likely moved RIGHT to (9, 0) and didn\u2019t eat an apple, so its tail moved.

UP is better for that.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 4), I can go UP again toward (2, 5), (2, 6), etc., aiming for (2, 8).

Going UP gets me to (2,7), then next turn I can eat (2,8) with UP.  \nEnemy is far away on right side, so (2,8) is safely mine if I move quickly.  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT delays eating and risks enemy later blocking.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy will be at (8,3) or nearby, far from (2,7). No risk.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nUP continues directly toward closest apple, keeps good future options, and is safe.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nNext turn (from (2,7)): eat apple at (2,8) with UP if still there. After eating, consider moving left toward open space or circling back down to avoid trapping myself.

LEFT to (5,2) moves slightly away from (6,5). Likely enemy goes UP toward nearest apple.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Safety after simultaneous move:**  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,3), still far from my possible destinations:  \n- UP (2,9): safe  \n- LEFT (1,8): safe  \n- RIGHT (3,8): safe  \n\nNo immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options from each safe move:**  \nFrom (2, 9):  \n- UP off board \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN (2, 8) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT (1, 9) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT (3, 9) \u2013 apple  \nOnly LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn, but RIGHT gets apple (3,9) immediately next turn if taken now.\n\nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP (1, 9) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT (0, 8) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2013 my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe  \n3 safe moves, no apple nearby.\n\nFrom (3, 8):  \n- UP (3, 9) \u2013 apple  \n- DOWN (3, 7) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT (2, 8) \u2013 my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT (4, 8) \u2013 empty  \n3 safe moves, and UP next turn gets apple (3,9).\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and long-term plan:**  \nApple at (3,9) is reachable in two ways:  \n1. Go RIGHT now to (3,8), then UP next turn to (3,9).  \n2. Go UP now to (2,9), then RIGHT next turn to (3,9).  \n\nOption 1 (RIGHT now) gives me more space after eating (3,9) because from (3,8) I can go UP to apple, then from (3,9) I can go LEFT to (2,9) or DOWN to (3,8) (but that\u2019s my neck after growth) \u2014 need to check: after eating (3,9), my body will be at [(3,9), (2,8), (2,7), ...], so from (3,9) DOWN to (3,8) would be my body (unsafe), LEFT to (2,9) empty, RIGHT off board, UP off board. So only LEFT safe next after eating (3,9). That\u2019s risky \u2014 only one exit.\n\nOption 2 (UP now to (2,9)): next turn from (2,9) RIGHT to (3,9) eats apple, then from (3,9) only LEFT to (2,9) is safe (same trap).  \n\nActually, both sequences lead to same trapped situation after eating (3,9). Maybe better to avoid (3,9) for now and instead go LEFT to (1,8) to explore open top-left area, keeping away from enemy who is moving toward right-side apples.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (6,2) cannot reach my possible destinations this turn.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term survival:**  \nMy snake length is 9 (after last apple). Enemy length is 11. I need to avoid being trapped. The top row (y=9) is dangerous because it has only one safe exit after eating (3,9). Better to stay flexible.\n\nLEFT to (1,8) gives 3 safe moves next turn and keeps me in open area with more future options. I can later go to (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), etc., and possibly loop down left side.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nLEFT keeps options open and avoids the (3,9) trap.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1,8), consider UP to (1,9) to scout top-left, then possibly LEFT to (0,9) to claim corner space. Monitor enemy movement toward (6,5) and right-side apples \u2014 let enemy compete there while I build a safe path along left side. Avoid moving back into my long body along column 2.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s check: after move, body becomes [(1,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] \u2013 yes (2,6) is still occupied by old tail segment until next move? Wait, tail moves only when not eating apple. We are not eating apple this turn, so tail moves forward one cell: the last segment (2,4) disappears, and each body segment shifts forward. So (2,6) will be occupied by the segment currently at (2,5). So (2,6) will be my body next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \nThus from (1, 6) next turn safe moves: DOWN (1,5) and LEFT (0,6). Two safe moves.\n\nFrom (2, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 8) \u2013 my body (currently at (2,8) but after move, body shifts: (2,8) becomes segment after head? Let\u2019s compute: new body after moving to (2,7) without eating: head (2,7), then (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7)?? Wait, that\u2019s wrong\u2014let\u2019s list carefully:  \nCurrent body: [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]  \nIf head moves RIGHT to (2,7), new body: [(2,7), (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)] \u2014 oh, (2,7) appears twice? That means (2,7) is both new head and old body segment? Actually, old head was (1,7), new head (2,7), old body includes (2,7) as the 5th segment. After shift without eating, we drop last segment (2,4), so new body is:  \n[ (2,7), (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6) ] \u2014 yes, (2,7) is at positions 0 (head) and 7 (tail part). That means (2,7) is occupied twice in the new body list, but that\u2019s fine: the head occupies it, and another segment occupies it too? That means the snake\u2019s body overlaps itself? That\u2019s impossible unless it\u2019s a bug in my reasoning. Let\u2019s check coordinates step by step:  \n\nCurrent: H(1,7), B0(0,7), B1(0,8), B2(1,8), B3(2,8), B4(2,7), B5(2,6), B6(2,5), B7(2,4) (length 9 total with head).  \nMove RIGHT: new head at (2,7). New body: old head (1,7) becomes new neck, then old B0(0,7), B1(0,8), B2(1,8), B3(2,8), B4(2,7), B5(2,6), B6(2,5). Drop old tail B7(2,4).  \nSo new body segments: (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5).  \nThus (2,7) appears as head and also as the 6th body segment. That means the cell (2,7) is occupied by two parts of the snake at the same time after the move\u2014this is impossible in normal Snake rules unless the snake is crossing over itself, which would be a collision. But in standard Snake, moving into a cell that will become your body after the shift is allowed because that cell is currently empty (it\u2019s the old head\u2019s position? Wait, (2,7) is currently occupied by B4(2,7) in the current body! Yes, currently (2,7) is occupied by my own body segment. So moving RIGHT into (2,7) would be moving into my own body now, not after the move. That means RIGHT is actually unsafe now!**\n\nI made a mistake in Step 1: RIGHT (2,7) is currently occupied by my body at index 4 in the current body list. So RIGHT is not safe.  \n\nLet\u2019s re-check current body coordinates:  \nBody: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4)]  \nYes, (2,7) is in that list. So RIGHT is into my own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nTherefore only DOWN is safe.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Verify DOWN (1,6):**  \n(1,6) is empty now (board shows '.' at (1,6)).  \nAfter move, body shifts: new head (1,6), neck (1,7), then (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), drop (2,4).  \nSo (1,6) is safe now and next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nOnly one safe move: DOWN.  \nThis keeps me alive and moves toward bottom left, away from enemy who is on right side.  \nFuture from (1,6): possible moves next turn DOWN (1,5) and LEFT (0,6) as computed earlier.  \nI need to avoid trapping myself; currently enemy is far, so surviving is priority.  \nNext turn I can consider moving toward apples cautiously, maybe via left side.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

None overlap my safe cells.  \nAlso check if enemy\u2019s body occupies my target: currently enemy body includes (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0).  \nMy targets (1,5) and (0,6) are clear.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options from each safe move:**  \n\nFrom (1, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 6) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2013 my body (currently at (2,5) but after move, body shifts: new body will be [(1,5), (1,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6)]; (2,5) is dropped, so (2,5) becomes empty next turn? Wait, check: current body: (1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). After moving DOWN to (1,5), new body: (1,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). So (2,5) is still occupied (now tail). So RIGHT into (2,5) next turn would be unsafe.  \nThus from (1,5) next turn safe moves: DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5). Two safe moves.\n\nFrom (0, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 7) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 5) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board (-1, 6) \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe  \n\nSo from (0,6) only DOWN (0,5) is safe next turn \u2014 only one safe follow-up. That\u2019s riskier.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and long-term planning:**  \nApples: (8,6), (8,7), (3,9), (6,7), (2,3).  \nClosest apple to my head (1,6) is (2,3) (Manhattan distance 4).  \nFrom (1,5), I\u2019m closer to (2,3) (distance 3).  \nFrom (0,6), I\u2019m farther (distance 5).  \nAlso, enemy is on right side, so moving LEFT (0,6) puts me near left edge with fewer future options. Moving DOWN (1,5) keeps me more central and opens path toward (2,3) via (1,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) possibly.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \n(0,6) leads to only one safe move next turn, which could be dangerous if enemy approaches later.  \n(1,5) gives two safe moves next turn, better flexibility.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nDOWN is better than LEFT because:  \n1. Keeps more future options (2 vs 1 safe moves next turn).  \n2. Moves toward closest apple (2,3).  \n3. Avoids left-edge trap.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1,5), consider moving DOWN (1,4) or LEFT (0,5) next turn, aiming to circle toward apple (2,3) while monitoring enemy movement. Enemy likely eating apple (8,6) this turn, so it may grow and extend body along right side. Keep distance and avoid being boxed in.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 after moving UP, my body will be [(8, 6), (7, 6), ...], so (8, 6) will be my neck, so DOWN would be suicide (backwards into neck). So from (8, 7) after eating apple, safe moves: UP, LEFT (7, 7), RIGHT (9, 7). That\u2019s 3 options \u2014 okay.  \n\n- **RIGHT (9, 6)**: No apple, but positions head near top-right corner.

So safe moves from (9, 6) next turn: UP, DOWN \u2014 only 2 options, slightly risky.  \n\n- **DOWN (8, 5)**: No apple, but opens more space.

RIGHT avoids apple but reduces options next turn. DOWN avoids apple but safer path long-term? But grabbing apple now is good \u2014 I\u2019m at 13 apples, enemy at 8, so extending lead is beneficial.  \n\n**Future planning:**  \nAfter UP to (8, 7), next turn avoid DOWN into neck. Consider moving UP to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 7) to stay flexible. Don\u2019t get trapped in top-right \u2014 maybe aim to go toward (6, 7) apple afterward.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP for immediate score and safe follow-ups.  \n\nUP",

Its body blocks right side heavily. I should avoid moving into right side where I could get trapped.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have 9 apples, enemy has 14. Need to collect apples faster but safely.  \n(2, 0) is reachable and far from enemy. Going DOWN now gets me closer to it while keeping options open.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nDOWN to (2, 2) is best:  \n- Moves toward apple (2, 0).  \n- Keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Avoids enemy territory.  \n- Avoids risky UP move with fewer options.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 2), next turn consider DOWN to (2, 1) then (2, 0) to eat apple, but check safety each turn. Keep left side open, avoid moving into (1, 2) if it becomes body later.  \n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Current head and possible moves:**  \nMy head is at (2, 2).  \nBody: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8)]  \n\nCheck each direction:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3) \u2013 my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1) \u2013 empty (board shows '.' at (2,1)).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2013 empty (board shows '.' at (1,2)).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2013 empty (board shows '.' at (3,2)).  \n\nImmediately safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #0 head at (6, 8), body long.**  \nEnemy possible moves from (6, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 apple at (6, 7) \u2013 enemy may go there to eat it.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 its own body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible next heads: (6, 9), (6, 7), (5, 8).  \nNone overlap my safe cells (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2).  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \n\nFrom DOWN to (2, 1):  \nNext turn possible moves from (2, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 2) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 0) \u2013 apple! Eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move, so body will be longer next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if DOWN leads to apple (2, 0) and we eat it (then (2, 2) still body, so UP unsafe). Actually, if we go DOWN to (2, 1) now, next turn DOWN to (2, 0) is safe (apple). That\u2019s good.\n\nFrom LEFT to (1, 2):  \nNext turn possible moves from (1, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT). Riskier.\n\nFrom RIGHT to (3, 2):  \nNext turn possible moves from (3, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2013 my body (neck after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (3, 9), (6, 7), (2, 0), (3, 8), (4, 6).  \nClosest to me: (2, 0) is 2 steps away (DOWN twice).  \n(3, 8) is 6 steps away.  \n(4, 6) is 4 steps away but enemy body near there.\n\nDOWN moves toward (2, 0).  \nRIGHT moves toward (4, 6) but enemy territory.  \nLEFT moves away from apples.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy likely goes DOWN to (6, 7) to eat apple there. That moves it away from me. Good.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI need apples to catch up (9 vs 14). (2, 0) is safest apple, far from enemy.  \nGoing DOWN now sets up eating it next turn.  \nLEFT gives fewer options next turn.  \nRIGHT moves into more crowded area.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nDOWN to (2, 1) is best:  \n- Moves toward apple (2, 0).  \n- Keeps 3 safe moves next turn (if we eat apple next turn, tail stays, but still safe moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (2, 0) after eating? Actually after eating apple at (2, 0), body will be longer so (2, 1) will be body next turn, but from (2, 0) next turn\u2019s safe moves: UP to (2, 1) body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (1, 0) empty, RIGHT (3, 0) empty \u2192 only 2 safe moves. But we can cross that bridge next turn\u2014maybe after eating apple we can go LEFT or RIGHT to open space.)\n\nStill, DOWN now gives immediate progress toward apple and avoids risky LEFT with fewer options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 1), next turn go DOWN to (2, 0) to eat apple, then likely go LEFT to (1, 0) to keep moving toward open left side. Avoid trapping myself.\n\nDOWN",

Eating (2, 0) now is tempting but could reduce future safe moves drastically. Better to keep flexibility, maybe circle back to it later.  \nLEFT (1, 1) opens up the left side which is fairly empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 1) moves toward apples (4, 6) and (4, 5) but also closer to enemy territory.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose safest with future options:**  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves into open space.  \nRIGHT also gives 3 safe moves but heads toward enemy.  \nDOWN gives apple but traps me next turn.\n\nGiven enemy is far, LEFT seems safest for maintaining options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1, 1), next turn consider going LEFT to (0, 1) or DOWN to (1, 0) to eventually eat (2, 0) from a safer angle, or UP to (1, 2) to explore. Avoid boxing myself in bottom-left.\n\nLEFT",

I need to catch up.  \nBoth moves lead to a single safe move next turn, but:  \n- LEFT (0, 0) \u2192 next turn only UP to (0, 1), then from (0, 1) maybe more options.  \n- RIGHT (2, 0) \u2192 next turn only RIGHT to (3, 0), then from (3, 0) maybe more options.  \n\nFrom (3, 0) I could go UP to (3, 1) (empty) and have more space. From (0, 1) I\u2019m near the left wall \u2014 slightly more restrictive.  \n\nAlso, eating apple now increases length, which could help in future if enemy tries to chase me \u2014 but also makes my body longer, possibly trapping myself later. However, immediate survival is same for both.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nGoing RIGHT gives me an apple and moves toward center/right side where there are more apples (4, 5), (4, 6) eventually.  \nLEFT gives no apple and sticks me to left edge with fewer options later.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT for scoring and slightly better future mobility after the forced move next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 0) after eating apple, next turn only safe move is RIGHT to (3, 0). Then from (3, 0) check UP/DOWN/RIGHT for safety and aim toward (4, 5) or (4, 6) apples while avoiding enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, after moving to (3, 1), my body will be: head (3, 1), neck (3, 0), then (2, 0), (1, 0), \u2026 So (3, 0) will be my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 1) \u2013 my body (segment after neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo from (3, 1) next turn, safe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nFrom (4, 0) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 0) \u2013 my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 0) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo from (4, 0) next turn, safe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nBoth give same immediate mobility next turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8)  \n\nFrom (3, 1): closer to top apples (distance y-difference 7\u20138).  \nFrom (4, 0): slightly further from top apples but closer to right side apples? Actually (4, 9) is far.  \n\nNeither move gets an apple this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is at (4, 5) with 17 apples, longer than me. It\u2019s in upper center.  \nI\u2019m at bottom. I need to grow safely without running into enemy.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3, 1), I\u2019m moving toward the column with apples at (3, 9) and (3, 8), but enemy is at (4, 5) and might move toward (3, 5) this turn, possibly cutting off my path upward later.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 0), I\u2019m moving under enemy\u2019s current position, possibly staying out of its way for now, but then I\u2019ll be at x=4, which is same column as enemy\u2019s head now. That could be risky if enemy moves down toward me.  \n\nActually, enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn are (4, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5). None are (4, 0). So RIGHT is safe this turn.  \n\nBut next turn, if enemy goes to (4, 4), then from (4, 0) I could go UP to (4, 1) and enemy could go DOWN to (4, 3) \u2014 still not adjacent. So maybe safe.  \n\nStill, going UP to (3, 1) keeps me in a column that\u2019s not directly under enemy\u2019s column, possibly safer from being blocked vertically.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nBoth moves are safe and give equal immediate future mobility.  \nI\u2019ll choose UP because it moves toward the cluster of apples at (3, 9)/(3, 8) and avoids being directly under enemy\u2019s column, which might reduce chance of accidental meeting.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 1), I\u2019ll have UP and RIGHT safe. Prefer UP to continue toward apples unless enemy blocks path. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s new head position to avoid head-on.  \n\nUP",

Avoid moving directly into its territory until I can safely approach apples from the side. From (5, 1), I can go UP to (5, 2) next turn, then possibly continue up the right side toward (4, 9) or (3, 9) from the east. This path avoids being directly under the enemy\u2019s column and reduces risk of being trapped.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nRIGHT gives safer separation from enemy\u2019s current position and maintains good mobility.  \n\nRIGHT",

My best plan is to avoid the enemy\u2019s zone and approach apples from the right or bottom later. Going UP gives me more options to go up the right side toward (4, 9) eventually. Going RIGHT keeps me near the bottom edge but limits vertical movement soon.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEnemy is focused on left-side apples. I should continue up the right side: UP now to (7, 2), then next turn UP again to (7, 3), then move toward (4, 9) from the east when safe. This keeps me away from enemy\u2019s immediate path and maintains good mobility.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT give 3 safe next moves, but UP moves me toward the top-right where apples are, while RIGHT moves me horizontally along the bottom. UP is slightly better for eventual apple access.\n\nUP",

Wait, check board: (7, 4) is empty now, but enemy body at (6, 4)? Actually enemy body list: (6, 5) is body, (6, 4) is empty. Let\u2019s check carefully: enemy body includes (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), etc. (6, 4) is free. So LEFT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 4) \u2013 empty.  \nSafe next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nFrom (8, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 2) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2) \u2013 apple at (9, 2) \u2013 but could be risky if enemy moves there? Actually enemy far away. But (9, 2) is empty now, but next turn if I go RIGHT now to (9, 3), then DOWN next turn to (9, 2) would eat apple. But if I go DOWN now to (8, 2), then RIGHT next turn to (9, 2) also eats apple. However, from (8, 2) only DOWN and RIGHT are safe next turn (2 options).  \n\nFrom (9, 3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 4) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 2) \u2013 apple at (9, 2) \u2013 safe unless enemy gets there first, but enemy is far.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe next moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\nSo UP gives 3 future options, DOWN gives 2, RIGHT gives 2.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (3, 9), (4, 9), (2, 4), (2, 3), (9, 2)  \nFrom (8, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 4) \u2013 moves toward top apples eventually.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 2) \u2013 closer to (9, 2) in 1 move next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3) \u2013 also close to (9, 2) in 1 move next turn.  \n\nBut (9, 2) is near bottom-right corner \u2013 going there could trap me if I eat it and grow, but I can exit upward from (9, 2) to (9, 3) or (8, 2) depending.  \n\nEnemy is far left, so (9, 2) is relatively safe to take soon.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy and plan**  \nEnemy is long (length 21) and controls left side. I should stay right and maybe go for top apples via right edge. UP now gives best future mobility and keeps me central-right. DOWN or RIGHT both lead toward (9, 2) but reduce options next turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go to (2, 4) apple this turn, growing longer. I should avoid moving toward enemy.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nUP gives most future safe moves and keeps me flexible to go for top apples or retreat to right edge later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 4), consider moving toward (4, 9) or (3, 9) via right side (columns 8\u20139) upward to avoid enemy body in middle-left. If enemy approaches, stay near right wall for escape routes. Possibly eat (9, 2) later if path is clear, but not urgent.\n\nUP",

Enemy is far enough that immediate collision unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nI'm ahead (22 vs 10 apples), so avoiding risk is wise.  \n- DOWN (2, 2) keeps me safe, opens space, avoids enemy.  \n- LEFT (1, 3) also safe, but closer to enemy's possible path if it goes toward (0, 9) later.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3) moves toward enemy's area, slightly riskier.  \n\nBest to go DOWN to secure open space and plan route to apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn strategy note:** After moving to (2, 2), consider going LEFT/DOWN to approach bottom-left area, then upward toward (0, 9) apple while avoiding enemy path.\n\nDOWN",
