The enemy snake, Snake #2, is at position (6, 6).\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest one seems to be at (0, 6), which is directly above my current position. Moving up would allow me to eat that apple and grow my snake.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious of the enemy snake's position at (6, 6). If I move up, I could potentially run into the enemy snake, which would result in my death.\n\nAnother option is to move left to (0, 4). This would put some distance between me and the enemy snake, and there is an apple at (1, 7) that I could potentially move towards on my next turn.\n\nGiven the current information, I think the best strategy is to move LEFT. This will create some space between me and the enemy snake, and I can then re-evaluate my options on the next turn.\n\nNext turn, I may want to consider moving up to (0, 6) to eat the apple, or potentially moving right to (1, 5) to explore other options.\n\nMy decided next move is: LEFT."

The closest apple to me is at (3, 6), which is directly to my left. \n\nSince my goal is to collect apples without running into walls, other snakes, or myself, moving left towards the apple at (3, 6) seems like the most logical choice. This move does not put me in immediate danger of colliding with the enemy snake at (0, 5) or going out of bounds.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns should involve navigating towards the closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions. After collecting the apple at (3, 6), I should reassess the board to decide whether to go for another nearby apple or move to a safer position.\n\nNext turn, I should consider the enemy snake's potential moves and how they might affect my path to the remaining apples.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
