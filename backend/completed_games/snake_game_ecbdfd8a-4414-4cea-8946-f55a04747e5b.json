The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (6, 9).\nThe board is 10x10, so coordinates range from 0 to 9.\n\nApples are at: (4, 6), (6, 3), (8, 0), (9, 8), (8, 4).\n\nMy current position is (8, 9).\nAvailable moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. **Check for immediate death:**\n   * **UP (8, 10):** Outside the board (y=10). **DEAD.**\n   * **DOWN (8, 8):** Safe. Apple at (9, 8) is nearby, but (8, 8) is just empty space.\n   * **LEFT (7, 9):** Safe. Moving away from the edge and closer to the center.\n   * **RIGHT (9, 9):** Safe. Moving towards the corner.\n\n2. **Check for collision with enemy snake (Snake #0 at (6, 9)):**\n   * Snake #0 is at (6, 9), next to me.\n\n   * If I move **DOWN (8, 8)**: Snake #0 could move DOWN (6, 8), LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9), or UP (6, 10 - dead). No head-on collision threat.\n   * If I move **LEFT (7, 9)**: I move one step closer to Snake #0. Snake #0 could move RIGHT (7, 9). **Head-on collision.** This is highly risky as we start close on the same row.\n   * If I move **RIGHT (9, 9)**: Snake #0 could move LEFT (5, 9) or stay put or move away. No direct collision threat.\n\n3. **Evaluate safe moves and proximity to apples:**\n\nSafe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. LEFT is dangerous due to potential head-on collision with Snake #0.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 9):**\n    *   This is the top-right corner. It immediately restricts future movement options (only DOWN or LEFT next turn).\n    *   An apple is at (9, 8), one step away from the resulting position.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (8, 8):**\n    *   This is a strong defensive move, moving away from the enemy snake on the same row.\n    *   The apple at (9, 8) is reachable in two steps (e.g., DOWN then RIGHT), or I could aim for the apple at (8, 4).\n    *   It gives more maneuvering room than RIGHT.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n*   Moving RIGHT aims quickly for (9, 8). (8, 9) -> (9, 9). Next turn, I'd likely move DOWN to (9, 8) and eat the apple.\n*   Moving DOWN puts me at (8, 8). I could move RIGHT to (9, 8) next turn and eat the apple.\n\nBoth lead to eating the (9, 8) apple in Turn 1, assuming no interruption.\n\nWhat will Snake #0 likely do? Snake #0 is at (6, 9) and has the whole top edge (6, 9) to (0, 9) mostly clear, except for me. Snake #0 might also aim for the (9, 8) apple, but it's much closer to me. Snake #0 is also far from other apples like (4, 6) or (6, 3). The only other nearby apple is (9, 8), three steps away for Snake #0 (e.g., RIGHT to (7, 9), RIGHT to (8, 9), DOWN to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 9) and DOWN to (9, 8)).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 9):\nNext turn, I move DOWN to (9, 8) and eat. Snake #0 is likely moving RIGHT if it wants the apple.\nT0: Me (8, 9) -> (9, 9). Snake 0 (6, 9) -> (7, 9) or (8, 9) or (5, 9) or (6, 8).\nIf Snake 0 moves (7, 9), I'm safe.\nIf Snake 0 moves (8, 9), I'm safe.\nIf Snake 0 moves (9, 9), we head-on collide. But Snake 0 is at (6, 9). Hitting (9, 9) is 3 steps, impossible in 1 turn. Oh, Snake 0 can only move 1 step.\n\nLet's re-examine collision danger for T0:\nMy preferred moves: DOWN (8, 8) or RIGHT (9, 9).\n\nIf Me -> RIGHT (9, 9):\nSnake 0 must move 3 steps RIGHT to reach (9, 9). Impossible.\nCollision is only if Snake 0 also targets (9, 9) AND that target is 1 step away. Snake 0 is at (6, 9). Safe.\n\nIf Me -> DOWN (8, 8):\nSnake 0 must move 2 steps RIGHT and 1 step DOWN, or 1 step DOWN and 2 steps R, etc. Impossible in 1 turn. Safe.\n\nThe immediate collision threat was LEFT (7, 9) vs Snake 0 moving RIGHT (7, 9). Since I eliminated LEFT, I am safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\nNow, comparing RIGHT (9, 9) and DOWN (8, 8) for efficiency:\n1. Move RIGHT (9, 9). T1: Move DOWN (9, 8). Eat apple. Total 2 turns to eat.\n2. Move DOWN (8, 8). T1: Move RIGHT (9, 8). Eat apple. Total 2 turns to eat.\n\nBoth achieve the goal in 2 turns.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT puts me in the corner (9, 9). If Snake #0 also starts moving RIGHT (e.g., to (7, 9)), I might feel more pressure being trapped in the corner after eating.\nMoving DOWN (8, 8) gives me more freedom. From (8, 8) I can go: UP (back to 8, 9 - bad), DOWN (8, 7), LEFT (7, 8), or RIGHT (9, 8). This offers more strategic options for T1 and beyond, especially since other apples are on the 8 x-coordinate ((8, 4), (8, 0)).\n\nI choose DOWN to prioritize safety and maximize future options while maintaining an easy path to the (9, 8) apple.\n\nMy plan: Move DOWN to (8, 8). Next turn, move RIGHT to (9, 8) and eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

The board is 10x10.\nMy snake (ID 1) is currently at (8, 8).\nThe enemy snake (ID 0) is at (6, 8).\nThe apple targets are: (4, 6), (6, 3), (8, 0), (9, 8), (8, 4).\n\nLast Turn Analysis (Turn 0): I moved DOWN from (8, 9) to (8, 8). Snake #0 moved from (6, 9) to (6, 8) (this is an assumption based on the provided state; enemy movement is inferred to be either toward the wall or down).\n\nMy current goal is to efficiently grab the closest apple at (9, 8).\n\n1. **Check for immediate death:**\n   * **UP (8, 9):** Safe. Moves away from the apple, back towards the starting position.\n   * **DOWN (8, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (8, 4) and (8, 0) apples.\n   * **LEFT (7, 8):** Safe. Moves closer to Snake #0, who is at (6, 8).\n   * **RIGHT (9, 8):** **Apple location.** Safe, and I collect the apple.\n\n2. **Check for collision with enemy snake (Snake #0 at (6, 8)):**\n   Snake #0 is 3 steps away horizontally and 0 steps vertically from my current position.\n\n   * If I move **RIGHT (9, 8)** (Apple): To collide, Snake #0 would need to move RIGHT twice (to 8, 8) and then have me move into (9, 8). Since collisions happen if we move to the same target cell, Snake #0 would need to target (9, 8). This requires 3 steps RIGHT, but only 1 move is allowed. Safe.\n\n   * If I move **LEFT (7, 8)**: Snake #0 could move RIGHT (7, 8). **Head-on collision.** This is a high-risk move because Snake #0 is at (6, 8) and moving right is a natural move to expand options or threaten me. Even if Snake #0 also moves DOWN (6, 7), I might still be targeted next turn. I should avoid L7, T1.\n\nSince the move RIGHT (9, 8) immediately scores an apple and is completely safe from the enemy snake this turn, it is the optimal move.\n\n3. **Optimal Move Selection:**\n   Move RIGHT to (9, 8). I will eat the apple, grow to length 2, and score 1 point.\n\n**Future Plan (for Turn 2):**\nAfter eating the (9, 8) apple, my head will be at (9, 8) and my tail/body will be at (8, 8). I need to avoid moving back into (8, 8).\nNew Targets: (4, 6), (6, 3), (8, 0), (8, 4).\nThe next closest apples are (8, 4) and (8, 0), both down the right side of the board.\nFrom (9, 8), I can move DOWN (9, 7) or LEFT (8, 8 - immediately suicidal).\nThe optimal path would be to move DOWN, aiming for (8, 4) or (8, 0). Snake #0 is currently at (6, 8) and will likely try to secure other apples or block me.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake is at (8, 8). The primary objective is the (9, 8) apple.\nCasting all moves:\n1. UP (8, 9): Safe, but moves away from the goal.\n2. DOWN (8, 7): Safe, moves towards other apples (8, 4, 8, 0).\n3. LEFT (7, 8): Dangerous. Snake #0 is at (6, 8) and could move RIGHT to (7, 8), resulting in a head-on collision. **Discard.**\n4. RIGHT (9, 8): Safe, eats the apple immediately. No collision risk as Snake #0 is too far away at (6, 8).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the clear, optimal choice as it secures the apple in this turn.\nStrategy for T2: After eating the apple, the head will be at (9, 8) and the body at (8, 8). I will likely move DOWN to (9, 7) to start migrating towards (8, 4) or (8, 0).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Length 1.\nApples are at: (4, 6), (6, 3), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 3).\n\nMy last move was DOWN from (9, 8) to (9, 7). I am still along the right wall, aiming for the cluster of apples on the right side. The tail is now at (9, 8).\n\n1. **Check for immediate self-death moves from (9, 7):**\n   * **UP (9, 8):** Suicidal. Moving directly into my own body segment/tail. **Eliminate.**\n   * **DOWN (9, 6):** Safe. Continues along the wall.\n   * **LEFT (8, 7):** Safe. Moves away from the wall.\n   * **RIGHT (10, 7):** Suicidal. Off the board (9 is max X). **Eliminate.**\n\n2. **Evaluate collision risk with Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (6, 6)):**\n   Remaining safe moves: DOWN (9, 6) and LEFT (8, 7).\n   Snake #0 is far away. Collision risk is zero this turn as Snake #0 cannot reach X=8 or X=9.\n\n3. **Evaluate apple proximity and strategy:**\n   Nearby apples:\n   * (9, 3): 4 units away via DOWN (Manhattan distance: 4). Requires 4 DOWN moves to reach.\n   * (8, 4): 4 units away via LEFT then DOWN (Manhattan distance: (9-8) + (7-4) = 1 + 3 = 4).\n   * (8, 0): 8 units away (Manhattan distance: 1 + 7 = 8).\n\n   *   **Move DOWN (9, 6):** This tracks directly towards the apple at (9, 3). This is the most straightforward path to an apple. After eating (9, 3), I can easily pivot left to (8, 3) or further down to (8, 0).\n   *   **Move LEFT (8, 7):** This moves me towards the center of the board, potentially engaging with Snake #0 sooner, though they are still distant. It positions me better to reach (8, 4), but I'm still 3 vertical units away from it once at (8, 7), and I'd be blocking the path to the apple at (9, 3) if I wanted to take it later.\n\n4. **Optimal Move Selection:**\n   Moving DOWN keeps me along a safe path and directly targets the apple at (9, 3). This ensures rapid apple collection while remaining safe from the current enemy position.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN the right wall towards (9, 3) to claim that apple. Once (9, 3) is consumed, I will look to move LEFT to collect (8, 4) and/or (8, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Both snakes die. This is high risk.\n\n3. **Evaluate Safe Moves and Apple Strategy:**\n\n   * **Move DOWN (9, 5):**\n     * Safe from self-collision and border.\n     * Safe from Enemy #0 collision (Enemy #0 cannot reach (9, 5)).\n     * Distance to (9, 3): 2 vertical cells.

Given the proximity of apples (4, 6) and my own position, Snake #0 might be tempted to move RIGHT to (8, 6) or (8, 5) to cut me off or aim for the side. It's too risky to move directly towards the enemy's potential path if a safer, productive path exists.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Moving DOWN to (9, 5) is the safest and most efficient move toward the target apple (9, 3). I must avoid the potential head-on collision at (8, 6).\n\n**Future Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN to collect the apple at (9, 3). After that, assess the relative positions of Snake #0 and the apples at (8, 0) and (8, 4). The enemy at (7, 6) is likely to move towards (6, 3) or (4, 6).\n\nDOWN",

(4, 6): Manhattan distance 5 (5 LEFT, 3 UP).\n4.  (8, 0): Manhattan distance 4 (1 LEFT, 3 DOWN).\n\nThe primary goal is the apple at (8, 4).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT (8, 3):**\n    *   Result: Moves toward (8, 4) in one step.\n    *   New Head: (8, 3). New Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4)].\n    *   This sets up the apple grab on Turn 8 (Move UP from (8, 3) to (8, 4)).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (9, 2):**\n    *   Result: Moves away from (8, 4) and deep into the corner (9, 0) region, potentially toward (8, 0).\n    *   New Head: (9, 2). New Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4)].\n    *   This is generally worse than moving LEFT as (8, 4) is closer and keeps me higher up on the board.\n\n**4. Evaluate Collision Risk with Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (5, 7)):**\nSnake #0 is currently at (5, 7).\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (1 step away): (5, 8) UP, (5, 6) DOWN, (4, 7) LEFT, (6, 7) RIGHT.\nMy snake is moving between (9, 3) and (8, 3). Manhattan distance between (8, 3) and Snake #0's likely positions is at least 4. No collision risk this turn.\n\n**5. Optimal Move Selection:**\nMoving LEFT to (8, 3) perfectly sets up for eating the apple at (8, 4) next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Turns 8+):**\nT8: From (8, 3), move UP to (8, 4) (eat apple, length 4, score 3).\nT9: From (8, 4), look towards (6, 3) (2 LEFT, 1 DOWN) or (4, 6) (4 LEFT, 2 UP), or (8, 0) (4 DOWN). (6, 3) seems like the closest and easiest target after (8, 4). Snake #0 might challenge for (4, 6) or (6, 3). If Snake #0 stays high, I might be able to grab (6, 3) safely.\n\nLEFT",

Strategic Choice:**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 4) is the optimal move.

No immediate collision danger.\n\n**4. Execute Path:**\nMove UP to (4, 2). This secures the path to (3, 2) or allows continuation toward (4, 6).\n\n**5.

(Tail (5, 3))\nApples collected: 7.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 Head: (4, 9). Length 1.\n\nApples remaining: (4, 6), (8, 0), (2, 9), (9, 6), (6, 7).\n\n**Board Visualization Notes:**\nMy snake moved right, now occupying (4, 3) (H). The previous head (3, 3) is now body. The old tail (6, 3) vanishes as we didn't eat an apple.\nNew body segments: (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2). Tail is (5, 3).\n\n**1. Identify Suicidal Moves from (4, 3):**\n*   **UP (4, 4):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (4, 2):** Moves into my body segment (4, 2). **Suicidal.**\n*   **LEFT (3, 3):** Moves into my body segment (3, 3) (the cell directly behind the head). **Suicidal (moves backward).**\n*   **RIGHT (5, 3):** Moves into my body segment (5, 3) (the tail, but since we didn't eat an apple, it is still occupied until S1 moves away). **Suicidal.**\n\nWait, let's re-verify the body segments carefully.\nHead (H) is (4, 3).\nBody (B): [(3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]. The last segment is the tail.\nA move onto the tail is safe *only* if the snake is guaranteed not to grow (i.e., not moving onto an apple). Since none of the adjacent cells have apples, the tail (5, 3) must vacate.\n\nRechecking:\n*   Body list: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\n*   (4, 3) H\n*   UP (4, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN (4, 2): Body. Suicidal.\n*   LEFT (3, 3): Body (directly behind H). Suicidal.\n*   RIGHT (5, 3): Tail. Since (4, 3) is NOT an apple, the tail (5, 3) will vacate and become free. **Therefore, RIGHT (5, 3) IS SAFE.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 4), RIGHT (5, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Goals & Closest Apples from (4, 3):**\nTarget apple: (4, 6). M Dist: 3 (0 R, 3 U).\n\n1.  **(4, 6):** M Dist 3.\n2.  **(6, 7):** M Dist 6 (2 R, 4 U).\n3.  **(8, 0):** M Dist 7 (4 R, 3 D).\n4.  **(2, 9):** M Dist 7 (2 L, 6 U).\n5.  **(9, 6):** M Dist 8 (5 R, 3 U).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (4, 6):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   M Dist to (4, 6) becomes 2 (0 R, 2 U). Excellent progress. This is the optimal path.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   M Dist to (4, 6) becomes 4 (1 L, 3 U). This moves away from the target vertical line (x=4). Not preferred.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Snake #0 (S0) at (4, 9):**\nS0 is at (4, 9), length 1.\nS0's closest apples:\n1. (2, 9): M Dist 2 (2 L).\n2. (6, 7): M Dist 4 (2 R, 2 D).\n3. (4, 6): M Dist 3 (3 D).\n\nS0 is extremely close to (2, 9) and (4, 6).\nIf S0 moves:\n*   L (3, 9): Targets (2, 9) (M Dist 1).\n*   R (5, 9): Targets (6, 7) (M Dist 3).\n*   D (4, 8): Targets (4, 6) (M Dist 2).\n\nIf S0 moves D -> (4, 8), it is now M Dist 2 from (4, 6). This is a potential race.\nMy plan is:\nT20: (4, 3) -> (4, 4) U (M Dist 2)\nT21: (4, 4) -> (4, 5) U (M Dist 1)\nT22: (4, 5) -> (4, 6) U (Apple eaten!)\n\nIf S0 moves D twice:\nT20: (4, 9) -> (4, 8) D\nT21: (4, 8) -> (4, 7) D\nT22: (4, 7) -> (4, 6) D (Apple collision/S0 wins/My head hits S0 body)\nIf S0 tries to race me actively, we will collide exactly on T22 at (4, 6).\n\nHowever, S0 is also M Dist 2 from (2, 9) by moving L, L. (2, 9) is slightly lower score parity but since S0 has 0 apples, path length may be the deciding factor for a simple greedy bot. Or S0 may prioritize attacking me, knowing my proximity to (4, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves L to (3, 9) on T20, it confirms S0 is going for (2, 9).\nIf S0 moves R to (5, 9) on T20, it confirms S0 is going for (6, 7).\nIf S0 moves D to (4, 8) on T20, it confirms S0 is racing me for (4, 6).\n\nSince I have the lead (7 apples vs 0), I should execute the optimal apple path unless collision is guaranteed. If S0 moves D, we collide in 2 turns. If I move UP, I guarantee I reach (4, 6) in 2 turns + 1 move (3 total).\n\nI must assume S0 is aggressive or optimal. Assuming S0 targets the closest apple which is (2, 9) (2 steps L, L) or (4, 6) (3 steps D, D, D). (2, 9) is technically closer if diagonal moves were allowed, but it's 2 steps away. (4, 6) is 3 steps away. S0 should target (2, 9).\n\nIf S0 moves L to (3, 9) or R to (5, 9), I get the apple safely.\nIf S0 moves D to (4, 8), a collision is *possible* on T22.\n*   My T22 move: (4, 5) -> (4, 6)\n*   S0 T22 move: (4, 7) -> (4, 6)\nThis is a head-on collision at (4, 6). Both snakes die.\n\n**Mitigation & Alternative Targets:**\nIf I believe S0 will move D, I must change targets.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 3):\nM Dist to (4, 6) is 4. M Dist to (6, 7) is 5.\nIf S0 moves D, S0 is still on my way for (4, 6).\nIf I move UP, UP, UP, I guarantee a collision if S0 tracks me.\n\nIf I instead aim for (6, 7) (M Dist 6):\nFrom (4, 3), I need R, R, U, U, U, U. (6 turns)\nIf S0 targets (6, 7) from (4, 9), S0 needs R, R, D, D (4 moves). S0 wins this race easily if S0 targets it.\n\nIf S0 targets the *other* close apple, (2, 9) (M Dist 7 for me).\n\nGiven S0's proximity to (4, 6) and (2, 9), S0 is most likely going for one of those. The risk of head-on collision at (4, 6) is very high if S0 tries to block or race.\n\nHowever, I am significantly ahead in score (7:0) and length (8:1). If both die, I win by score. But I prefer to stay alive.\n\nLet's assume S0 prioritizes the shortest path to *one* apple, (2, 9). S0 will move L.\nT20: S0 (4, 9) -> (3, 9) L. Me (4, 3) -> (4, 4) U. Apple (4, 6) remains mine.\n\nLet's assume S0 targets me (the richest/longest target). S0 moves D.\nT20: S0 (4, 9) -> (4, 8) D. Me (4, 3) -> (4, 4) U.\nNow S0 is on my axis. S0 (4, 8), Me (4, 4). Gap 4.\nT21: S0 (4, 8) -> (4, 7) D. Me (4, 4) -> (4, 5) U. Gap 2.\nT22: S0 (4, 7) -> (4, 6) D. Me (4, 5) -> (4, 6) U. Collision.\n\nSince a collision is guaranteed if S0 moves D, I must avoid the (4, X) column.\n\n**Re-evaluating Safe Moves and Alternative Plan:**\nSafe moves: UP (4, 4) [leads to collision risk in 2 turns], RIGHT (5, 3).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 3):\nMy position is (5, 3).\nM Dist to (4, 6) is 4 (1 L, 3 U).\nM Dist to (6, 7) is 5 (1 R, 4 U).\n\nIf S0 moves D to (4, 8):\nT20: Me (5, 3) R. S0 (4, 8) D.\nIf I then proceed L, U, U, U to get (4, 6).\nT21: Me (4, 3) L. S0 (4, 7) D.\nT22: Me (4, 4) U. S0 (4, 6) D (S0 eats A, length 2).\nT23: Me (4, 5) U.\nT24: Me (4, 6) U. I hit S0's body at (4, 6) or (4, 7) depending on S0's *new* body position.\n\nIf S0 stops at (4, 6) on T22, S0's body is (4, 7). On T23, my move to (4, 6) would run into S0's body (4, 7) if S0 moved U, or S0's head (4, 6) if S0 moved L/R/D. I still can't reach (4, 6) if S0 aims for it.\n\n**Conclusion:** Collision avoidance is paramount. I must assume S0 recognizes the threat of (4, 6) and defends/takes it.\n\nTargeting (6, 7) (M Dist 6) is much safer, although slower.\nPath: R, U, U, R, U, U.\n(4, 3) -> (5, 3) R\n(5, 3) -> (5, 4) U\n(5, 4) -> (5, 5) U\n(5, 5) -> (6, 5) R\n(6, 5) -> (6, 6) U\n(6, 6) -> (6, 7) U (EAT T25)\n\nThis path requires 5 moves. Slower than S0's optimal path to (6, 7) if S0 chooses it, but S0 has two closer options ((2, 9) and (4, 6)).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (5, 3), I maximize distance from the (4, X) column and open up the route to the right side of the board.\n\nLet's check the constraints of moving RIGHT:\n(4, 3) -> (5, 3) R.\nIt is safe. It moves me away from S0's immediate defensive/attacking line.\n\nIf S0 targets (2, 9) (L L): S0 is at (2, 9) T22.\nIf S0 targets (4, 6) (D D D): S0 is at (4, 6) T22.\nIf S0 targets (6, 7) (R R D D): S0 is at (6, 7) T23.\nIf S0 targets (8, 0) (R R R R D D D D D D D): very slow.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I position myself to go for (6, 7) if S0 takes (4, 6) or (2, 9).\n\nThe move RIGHT to (5, 3) is the defensive choice that maintains viability and opens up a new, safe primary target (A5: (6, 7)).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Turns 20+):**\nS0 is threatening to intercept (4, 6). Move RIGHT to (5, 3) to establish a safe path towards apple (6, 7) or, alternatively, to circle back to (4, 6) if S0 goes for (2, 9). Proceed defensively towards (6, 7) via upward movements (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), etc., while monitoring S0's movement on the top edge.\n\nRIGHT",

The previous move RIGHT by S0 (to (5, 9)) suggests an affinity for the right side of the board, making (6, 7) (1 R, 2 D) slightly more predictable than (2, 9) (3 L).\n\nIf S0 targets (2, 9) (L L L), then my path L, U, U, U is optimal for (4, 6).\nIf S0 targets (6, 7) (R D D), then my path L, U, U, U is optimal for (4, 6).\n\nOnly if S0 specifically pivots *back* to (4, 6) (L D D D) will we collide.\n\nGiven that I gained a position (5, 3) that allows me to immediately pivot back to the optimal column (4, X) and S0 did not claim (4, X), I should take the risk on (4, 6) because it is the closest apple (M Dist 4 via LEFT move now) and failing to secure it lets S0 catch up in score quickly.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 3):\nCurrent head (5, 3). Body [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)].\nMoving LEFT (4, 3) moves onto the cell directly behind the head. This is the definition of moving backwards and is suicidal unless my body list is ordered differently.\n\nLet's re-read the body description: Head is (5, 3). Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ... (5, 2)].\n(4, 3) is the immediate neighbor behind the head. **Moving LEFT to (4, 3) is a suicidal move (moves directly backward).**\n\n**RE-EVALUATING SAFE MOVES:**\nSafe moves: UP (5, 4), DOWN (5, 2), RIGHT (6, 3).\nThe LEFT move is OUT. I cannot go directly to the (4, X) column!\n\nThis changes everything. My previous move RIGHT (to (5, 3)) has put me in a position to be forced to move UP or RIGHT, making (4, 6) instantly M Dist 5 or 6, unless I go DOWN and maneuver.\n\n**New Apple Distances from Safe Moves:**\n\nA. Move UP to (5, 4). (M Dist 3 to (4, 6) via L, U, U)\n1. (4, 6): M Dist 3. (L, U, U)\n2. (6, 7): M Dist 4. (R, U, U)\n\nB. Move DOWN to (5, 2). (M Dist 5 to (4, 6) via L, U, U, U, U) - Path complexity increases due to my body.\n1. (4, 6): M Dist 5. (Move L at (5, 2) is safe, then U, U, U, U.)\n2. (6, 7): M Dist 6.\n\nC. Move RIGHT to (6, 3). (M Dist 5 to (4, 6) via L, L, U + 1)\n1. (4, 6): M Dist 5. (L, L, U, U, U)\n2. (6, 7): M Dist 4. (U, U, U, U)\n\n**Optimal Safe Move T21: UP to (5, 4)**\n\n**Path to (4, 6) via UP (T24 EAT):**\n(5, 3) U -> (5, 4) (M Dist 3 to (4, 6))\nT22: (5, 4) L -> (4, 4) (M Dist 2 to (4, 6))\nT23: (4, 4) U -> (4, 5) (M Dist 1)\nT24: (4, 5) U -> (4, 6) (EAT)\n\nThis gets me to (4, 6) in 3 turns (Arrival T24). This is one turn slower than if I could have moved directly LEFT, but it is safe.\n\nNow re-check S0's movement against T24 arrival:\nS0 (5, 9).\nIf S0 goes for (4, 6) (L, D, D, D): S0 arrives at T24 as well, causing a collision at (4, 6).\nIf S0 avoids (4, 6), I get it.\n\nSince S0 is a threat for (4, 6) AND (6, 7), I must consider the immediate race.\n\nIf I target (6, 7) via RIGHT instead:\nT21: (5, 3) R -> (6, 3) (M Dist 4 to (6, 7))\nT22: (6, 3) U -> (6, 4)\nT23: (6, 4) U -> (6, 5)\nT24: (6, 5) U -> (6, 6)\nT25: (6, 6) U -> (6, 7) (EAT) (T25 arrival)\n\nS0 targets (6, 7) (R, D, D): S0 arrives T23. S0 wins this race.\n\nTherefore, targeting (4, 6) is the faster and potentially only option left, even with the collision risk. If I move UP, I maintain the threat/race status vs S0 for (4, 6).\n\n**Mitigating Collision Risk at (4, 6):**\nIf I move UP to (5, 4), I'm signaling a move towards the top-center.\nIf S0 anticipates me moving for (4, 6) and commits (L, D, D, D), we collide.\n\nIf S0 is truly greedy and focused on shorter paths:\n1. (6, 7) (M Dist 3 via R, D, D) -> S0 wins race, I am T25.\n2. (2, 9) (M Dist 3 via L, L, L) -> S0 wins race, I target (4, 6).\n\nIf S0 goes for (6, 7) (S0 R): T21 S0 (6, 9). I move U to (5, 4). S0 is far from (4, 6). I safely get (4, 6) T24.\nIf S0 goes for (2, 9) (S0 L): T21 S0 (4, 9). S0 is on the diagonal axis for (4, 6) (M Dist 3 from (4, 9)). If S0 continues D, D, D, it leads to collision.\n\nIf S0 moves L to (4, 9), S0 is now positioned to race me for (4, 6). If S0 moves L to (4, 9) and I move UP to (5, 4), S0 still has the advantage if we both turn towards (4, 6).\nT21: S0 (4, 9) L. Me (5, 4) U.\nT22: S0 (4, 8) D. Me (5, 4) L -> (4, 4).\nT23: S0 (4, 7) D. Me (4, 4) U -> (4, 5).\nT24: S0 (4, 6) D. Me (4, 5) U -> (4, 6). COLLISION.\n\nI cannot risk the collision if S0 assumes I go for (4, 6). I must select a path that does not lead to a collision if S0 tracks me.\n\n**Alternative Target: (8, 0)**\n(5, 3) to (8, 0) M Dist 6.\nPath: R, R, D, D, D, D. (T27 arrival) Too slow.\n\n**Alternative strategy: Block S0/Force S0 to move away from (4, 6).**\nIf S0 is aiming for (6, 7) (M Dist 3), then S0 will move R to (6, 9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 3), I position myself for (6, 7) if S0 deviates, or for (9, 6).\nT21: Me (6, 3) R.\nT22: Me (6, 4) U. S0 T22: (6, 8) D.\nT23: Me (6, 5) U. S0 T23: (6, 7) EAT.\nI still lose the (6, 7) race.\n\nGiven the high probability of S0 seeking the closest apples (2, 9) or (6, 7), and my guaranteed collision if S0 chooses to race me for (4, 6), I should aim for a safer apple, even if it is slower.\n\nSince S0 favored the RIGHT side (move to (5, 9)), S0 has M Dist 3 to (6, 7). S0 is high probability to take (6, 7).\n\nIf S0 takes (6, 7) (T23), then (4, 6) becomes safe for me (T24).\nIf S0 takes (2, 9) (T23), then (4, 6) becomes safe for me (T24).\n\nThe safest move is to choose a path which does not enter the collision path right away, but still heads towards one of the targets.\n\nMove UP to (5, 4). This move is part of the path to (4, 6) and (6, 7), and is not committing me to the (4, X) column yet.\n\nIf S0 moves L to (4, 9) (targeting (2, 9) or (4, 6)):\nT22: I must move towards (4, X) if I commit to (4, 6), which leads to collision risk.\nIf I move R to (6, 4) instead?\nT22: Me (6, 4). S0 (4, 8) D. Now S0 gets (4, 6) safely. I move to (6, 7) (T26 arrival).\n\nIf S0 moves R to (6, 9) (targeting (6, 7)):\nT22: S0 (6, 8) D. I move L to (4, 4), then I proceed to (4, 6) safely.\n\nThis means the viability of (4, 6) depends entirely on S0's move:\n1. S0 L (4, 9) -> Collision risk. I must avoid (4, 6).\n2. S0 R (6, 9) -> I get (4, 6) safely.\n\nSince I am ahead 7-0, risking suicide is unacceptable. I must assume the worst-case for S0 (S0 moves L and races me for (4, 6)).\n\nIf S0 moves L, I must abandon (4, 6).\nIf I move UP to (5, 4), and S0 moves L to (4, 9), I must pivot right immediately:\nT21: Me (5, 4) U. S0 (4, 9) L.\nT22: Me (6, 4) R. S0 (4, 8) D.\nT23: Me (6, 5) U. S0 (4, 7) D.\nT24: Me (6, 6) U. S0 eats (4, 6) D.\nT25: Me (6, 7) EAT.\nIn this case, I trade (4, 6) for (6, 7). I get (6, 7) slightly late (T25 vs S0's T23 if S0 targeted it originally) but safe.\n\nThe move UP (5, 4) maintains flexibility to pivot L (for (4, 6) if S0 goes R) or R (for (6, 7) if S0 goes L).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (6, 3):\nT21: Me (6, 3) R. S0 (4, 9) L.\nT22: Me (6, 4) U. S0 (4, 8) D.\nT23: Me (6, 5) U. S0 (4, 7) D.\nT24: Me (6, 6) U. S0 eats (4, 6) D.\nT25: Me (6, 7) EAT.\nSame outcome, T25 arrival for (6, 7).\n\nSince UP moves me into \"safer territory\" (less body density around (5, 4) than (6, 3)), and keeps open the fastest approach to (4, 6) if S0 deviates right, UP is slightly better than RIGHT.\n\nI stick with a defensive move UP, anticipating S0 will either take (2, 9) or (4, 6). If S0 takes (4, 6), I move R, R, U to secure (6, 7) instead.\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (Turns 21+):\nMove UP to (5, 4). Monitor S0's x-coordinate. If S0 moves L (4, 9), pivot RIGHT towards (6, 7). If S0 moves R (6, 9), pivot LEFT towards (4, 6).\n\nUP",
