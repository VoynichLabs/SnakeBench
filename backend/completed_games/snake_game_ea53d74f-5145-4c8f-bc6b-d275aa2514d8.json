There are two opportunities for growth: one at (5, 9) and one at (0, 2). Since moving right would take me closer to the apple at (5, 9), I'll prioritize that one for now. However, it's important to keep an eye on the apple at (0, 2) as well, as it could potentially be reached later without putting me in danger.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep moving right to approach the apple at (5, 9) while keeping an eye on the other apples and avoiding collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
