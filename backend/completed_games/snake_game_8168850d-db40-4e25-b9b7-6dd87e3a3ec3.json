          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current board state and make a move step by step.\n\n### Current State Recap:\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (0, 6)\n  - Body: None (just a single segment)\n  - Apples collected: 0\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (0, 2)\n  - Body: None\n- **Apples:** (7,7), (5,2), (4,2), (3,7), (7,4)\n- **Board layout:** 10x10 grid, y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Immediate Threats\n- Your head is at (0,6). The only way you can die immediately is if you move into a cell that is occupied by another snake's head or your own body (but since your body is empty, only enemy heads matter).\n- Enemy head is at (0,2). Your head is at (0,6), so the only way you can collide with the enemy head is if you move in a direction that brings your head closer to (0,2) in the x-direction (since y=6 is already higher than y=2, moving down would not bring you closer in y). So, moving left (decreasing x) would bring you closer to the enemy head at (0,2) in the x-direction, but since both heads are at x=0, moving left would place your head at (-1,6), which is off the board (x < 0). So, moving left is invalid because it would take you off the board.\n- Moving right (increasing x) would place your head at (1,6), which is safe.\n- Moving up (increasing y) would place your head at (0,7), which is safe.\n- Moving down (decreasing y) would place your head at (0,5), which is safe.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Collisions with Enemy Body or Ourselves\n- Your body is empty, so no immediate collision with your own body.\n- Enemy body is empty, so no immediate collision with enemy body.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Safe Moves\nFrom the above, all four directions are safe except left (off the board). So, safe moves are up, down, right.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Safe Moves for Future Apple Collection\nLet's look at the apples and their positions relative to your current head:\n\n- Apple at (7,7): far away, moving towards it would require a long path.\n- Apple at (5,2): far away, moving towards it would require a long path.\n- Apple at (4,2): far away.\n- Apple at (3,7): closer to your current y-coordinate (y=6 vs y=7), but still far in x.\n- Apple at (7,4): far in x and y.\n\nSince your snake is just a single segment, you cannot eat any apples in one move. You need to grow by eating an apple to have a body and be able to move towards other apples.\n\n### Step 5: Consider Enemy Movement\nEnemy snake is at (0,2). It will move in one of the four directions. If it moves up (increasing y), it could reach (0,3) or (0,1) or (0,2) again (if it moves down), or left/right (but x=0 is the edge, so left would be off the board). So, it will likely move up or down.\n\n### Step 6: Choose a Move to Grow Safely and Avoid Future Threats\nSince you can't eat an apple in one move, you need to choose a move that keeps you safe and allows you to grow in the next turn. You should choose a direction that keeps you away from the enemy head and opens up future options.\n\n- Moving right (1,6): This keeps you away from the enemy head (x=0) and moves you towards the right side of the board. This is a safe and neutral move.\n- Moving up (0,7): This moves you towards the top of the board, which is away from the enemy head.\n- Moving down (0,5): This moves you towards the bottom of the board, which is also away from the enemy head.\n\nBetween these, moving right (1,6) seems to be the safest and most neutral move, as it doesn't immediately threaten the enemy and doesn't put you in a position where you might be trapped.\n\n### Step 7: Long-Term Strategy Note\nFor the next few turns:\n1. Grow by eating an apple as soon as possible to increase your body length and mobility.\n2. Avoid moving directly towards enemy heads or bodies.\n3. Try to stay away from the enemy snake's path to prevent collisions.\n4. Keep an eye on the apples and plan to grow towards the nearest apple to increase your chances of reaching others.\n\n### Final Move:\nRIGHT",

If it moves right (to **(2,2)**), I should avoid moving left (to **(0,6)**).\n3. **Safe Expansion:** Moving right (to **(2,6)**) is safe and neutral.

Thus, **all four directions are safe** for this turn.\n\n#### **2. Apple Proximity & Growth Strategy**\n- **Closest Apples:**\n  - `(5,2)` (distance: ~5x, 4y from head)\n  - `(7,4)` (distance: ~5x, 2y)\n  - `(7,7)` (distance: ~5x, 1y)\n- **Current Snake Length:** 1 (head only).\n- **Goal:** Grow toward apples while avoiding enemy threats.\n\n#### **3. Enemy Threat Assessment**\n- **Enemy Snake #0:**\n  - Current head: `(2,2)`\n  - Possible moves this turn (assuming no body to block):\n    - UP: `(2,3)`\n    - DOWN: `(2,1)`\n    - LEFT: `(1,2)`\n    - RIGHT: `(3,2)`\n- **Our Snake\u2019s Possible Moves:**\n  - If enemy moves UP to `(2,3)`, we should avoid moving DOWN to `(2,5)` (direct path).\n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to `(3,2)`, we should avoid moving LEFT to `(1,6)` (direct path).\n  - If enemy moves LEFT to `(1,2)`, we should avoid moving UP to `(2,7)` (direct path).\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- **RIGHT to `(3,6)`** is neutral and avoids direct enemy paths.\n- **UP to `(2,7)`** is risky if enemy moves LEFT (but unlikely).\n- **DOWN to `(2,5)`** is safer if enemy moves UP, but less ideal for growth.\n- **LEFT to `(1,6)`** is safe but blocks future expansion toward apples.\n\n#### **4. Long-Term Growth Plan**\n- **Short-Term:** Move RIGHT to `(3,6)` to expand body toward apples on the right.\n- **Mid-Term:** Extend toward `(5,2)` or `(7,4)` by growing rightward.\n- **Avoid:** Trapping in narrow paths or enemy collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:**\n**DOWN**",

Immediate Safety Check**\n- **Head Position:** `(2, 5)` (from last move: DOWN from `(2,6)`).\n- **Last Move:** DOWN (so previous direction was UP).\n- **Body:** None (still a single-segment snake).\n- **Enemy Snake #0:**\n  - Head at `(3, 2)` (from last turn\u2019s move: RIGHT from `(2,2)`).\n  - Possible moves this turn (no body to block):\n    - UP: `(3,3)`\n    - DOWN: `(3,1)`\n    - LEFT: `(2,2)`\n    - RIGHT: `(4,2)`\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n- **UP:** `(2,6)` \u2192 Valid (no overlap with enemy or body).\n- **DOWN:** `(3,5)` \u2192 Valid.\n- **LEFT:** `(1,5)` \u2192 Valid.\n- **RIGHT:** `(3,5)` \u2192 Wait, no: RIGHT from `(2,5)` is `(3,5)` (same as DOWN). **This is a collision with the cell behind the head (backwards move).**\n  - *Correction:* RIGHT from `(2,5)` is `(3,5)`, which is **not** the cell directly behind the head (the head is at `(2,5)`, so the cell behind is `(2,4)`). Thus, **RIGHT is safe** (no self-collision).\n  - *Clarification:* The rule prohibits moving directly backwards (i.e., into the cell *directly* behind the head). Here, moving RIGHT is not backwards, so it\u2019s valid.\n\n**Dangerous Moves:**\n- **Backwards (UP from `(2,5)`):** `(2,6)` is valid, but since the last move was DOWN, moving UP would be a direct reversal (self-collision). **This is invalid.**\n  - *Correction:* The last move was DOWN, so moving UP is **not** a direct reversal (since the snake didn\u2019t move UP last turn). Thus, **all four directions are safe** for this turn.\n\n#### **2. Apple Proximity & Growth Strategy**\n- **Closest Apples:**\n  - `(7,4)` (distance: ~5x, 1y from head).\n  - `(7,7)` (distance: ~5x, 2y).\n  - `(5,2)` (distance: ~3x, 3y).\n- **Current Snake Length:** 1.\n- **Goal:** Grow toward apples while avoiding enemy threats.\n\n#### **3. Enemy Threat Assessment**\n- **Enemy Snake #0:**\n  - Current head: `(3,2)`.\n  - Possible moves this turn:\n    - UP: `(3,3)`.\n    - DOWN: `(3,1)`.\n    - LEFT: `(2,2)`.\n    - RIGHT: `(4,2)`.\n- **Our Snake\u2019s Possible Moves:**\n  - If enemy moves LEFT to `(2,2)`, we should avoid moving UP to `(2,6)` (direct path).\n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to `(4,2)`, we should avoid moving LEFT to `(1,5)` (direct path).\n  - If enemy moves UP to `(3,3)`, we should avoid moving DOWN to `(3,5)` (direct path).\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- **UP to `(2,6)`** is risky if enemy moves LEFT (but unlikely).\n- **DOWN to `(3,5)`** is safer if enemy moves UP, but less ideal for growth.\n- **LEFT to `(1,5)`** is safe but blocks future expansion toward apples.\n- **RIGHT to `(3,5)`** is neutral and avoids direct enemy paths.\n\n#### **4. Long-Term Growth Plan**\n- **Short-Term:** Move RIGHT to `(3,5)` to expand body toward apples on the right.\n- **Mid-Term:** Extend toward `(7,4)` or `(7,7)` by growing rightward.\n- **Avoid:** Trapping in narrow paths or enemy collisions.\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Phase 1 (Turns 1-10):** Expand rightward toward `(7,4)` or `(7,7)` while avoiding enemy threats.\n- **Phase 2 (Turns 10-30):** Prioritize apples `(7,4)` and `(7,7)`; if enemy grows, expand diagonally toward `(5,2)`.\n- **Phase 3 (Final):** If possible, reach 30 apples before enemies do.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nLEFT",
