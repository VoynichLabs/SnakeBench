They cannot reach (4,1) this turn, so there\u2019s zero collision risk.  \n  - Their likely moves (down to (4,8) or left to (3,9)) stay far away from our column\u202f4, leaving us free to claim the apple.\n\n- **Strategic outlook:**  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Score catch\u2011up:** Eating the apple ties us at 2\u202fvs\u202f3, narrowing the gap.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Vertical corridor:** After grabbing (4,1) we\u2019ll be in column\u202f4, a clear \u201cpipe\u201d to climb upward where many apples await (4,4, 4,9 opponent head).  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Body wall:** Growing to three segments gives us a moving wall to start hemming the opponent toward the centre later.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Flexibility:** From (4,1) we\u2019ll have UP, LEFT, RIGHT as safe options next turn, keeping our options open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- **Turn\u202f5:** go **LEFT** to (4,1), eat the apple, grow.  \n- **Turn\u202f6\u2011\u2026:** continue upward along column\u202f4, snatching apples (4,4) and using our longer body to block the rival\u2019s routes, steering them into a corner or a head\u2011on when we have the score advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that fruit and start the vertical assault! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

After that we can slide left into the (6,\u202f4) apple, then snake around the left side where we already own a wall of segments (0\u20115,\u202fy\u202f5\u20113).  \n4. Meanwhile the opponent will be stuck on the top\u2011right edge, forced to either wander down column\u202f9 or loop back left through a space we\u2019ll block with our growing wall.  \n\nBy expanding down column\u202f7 and snatching the low\u2011row apples we *increase our length* faster than the rival and *seal off his escape routes* with our own body. With a higher score (12\u202fvs\u202f9) any eventual head\u2011on will favor us, so the aggressive push is exactly what we need.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Let\u2019s grab that apple and start the squeeze!**  \n\nDOWN",

Moving **LEFT** now puts us on a direct path to that fruit on the next turn, letting us grow and extend our wall along row\u202f4.  \n- Growing now also **freezes our tail**, preserving the barrier we\u2019ve built along the bottom\u2011left edge.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Tactical Play**  \n\n1. **Turn\u202f26:** **LEFT** to (5,\u202f4) \u2013 empty, opens a route to the apple at (4,\u202f4).  \n2. Next turn we can slide into (4,\u202f4) for the apple, tightening the corridor that the rival must thread through.  \n3. Meanwhile we keep multiple escape routes (downward at x\u202f5\u20116, leftward continuation) and avoid the dead\u2011end up\u2011move.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Safety Net** \u2013 No body or wall blocks (5,\u202f4); opponent can\u2019t reach it this turn; we retain plenty of future moves.\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Longer\u2011term note** \u2013 After grabbing (4,\u202f4) aim to climb up column\u202f4 and shadow the opponent\u2019s descent, turning our snake into a moving wall that forces them toward the edge. Keep the apple line in sight and never step into a cell that will become our own body next turn.\n\n**Decision:**  \n\nLEFT",

UP and LEFT are the only non\u2011lethal options.  \n\n\ud83c\udf4e **Apple check:** Neither (7,2) nor (6,1) currently holds an apple, but LEFT moves us one step closer to the (3,1) apple and ultimately to the bottom\u2011row apples (1,0), (3,0), (9,0). UP just climbs us into empty space with no immediate gain.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Future\u2011proofing:** Heading LEFT opens a clear corridor toward the left side where many apples cluster, while still leaving the upward path open for escape or aggressive repositioning. Staying on the left also keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s head at (0,5) which is still stuck on the far left edge.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- Move LEFT now \u2192 position (6,1)  \n- Next turn consider another LEFT or a DOWN to chase the bottom\u2011row apples  \n- Keep an upward escape route (UP) ready to dodge any head\u2011on collision  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Aggressive vibe:** We\u2019re hungry for more points, so let\u2019s squeeze that leftward step and start closing the gap on the apple stash!  \n\nLEFT",
