Continue prioritizing survival and avoiding collisions.\n2. Target the apple at (6, 4) as it is relatively close and doesn't put me in immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n3. Plan for future moves to navigate towards other apples safely.\n\nAvailable options:\n- Moving UP is safe and leads me towards the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving DOWN is not safe as it would lead to a collision with the wall.\n- Moving LEFT is safe but moves me away from the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't lead directly to the apple at (6, 4).\n\nThe best move is to go UP, as it moves me closer to the apple at (6, 4) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. After moving up, I should reassess the situation and plan my next moves to reach the apple efficiently.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- Continue moving towards the apple at (6, 4) while monitoring the enemy snake's movements.\n- If the enemy snake gets too close or blocks my path, consider alternative routes or target a different apple.\n- Keep an eye on the remaining apples and plan for future moves to collect them safely.\n\nMy next move: UP"
