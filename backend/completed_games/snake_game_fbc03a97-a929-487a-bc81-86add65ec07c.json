This move strengthens our growth potential by gaining the closest apple.\n\n- **Post-Move Strategy**:\n  - Proceed directly north from (4, 4) to (4, 5) to (4, 6) and finally reaching the apple at (4, 8).\n  - Monitor the progression of the enemy snake to avoid potential collision at (5, 2).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n- **Move**: UP\n\n### Future Strategy\n- Upon reaching (4, 8), continue northward to secure the apple, optimizing point gain while keeping a safe distance from enemy snake risk if it is moving into the (4, 7) space.\n  \nThis direction maximizes the potential for gaining points through apple acquisition while minimizing collision risk. By moving upward, I will easily reach the apple without immediate conflict with the enemy snake head. \n\nI will continue extending my strategy by moving north and align towards the apple at (4, 8). Monitor the environment for changes in enemy snake behavior and adapt accordingly to maintain safety and secure point acquisition. By choosing **UP** now, I strategically position my snake closer to the nearest apple and ensure growing towards achieving the goal of maximizing points.\n\nNext Move: UP",

This move strengthens our growth potential by gaining the closest apple.\n\n- **Post-Move Strategy**:\n  - Proceed directly north from (4, 4) to (4, 5) to (4, 6) and finally reaching the apple at (4, 8).\n  - Monitor the progression of the enemy snake to avoid potential collision at (5, 2).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n- **Move**: UP\n\n### Future Strategy\n- Upon reaching (4, 8), continue northward to secure the apple, optimizing point gain while keeping a safe distance from enemy snake risk if it is moving into the (4, 7) space.\n  \nThis direction maximizes the potential for gaining points through apple acquisition while minimizing collision risk. By moving upward, I will easily reach the apple without immediate conflict with the enemy snake head. \n\nI will continue extending my strategy by moving north and align towards the apple at (4, 8). Monitor the environment for changes in enemy snake behavior and adapt accordingly to maintain safety and secure point acquisition. By choosing **UP** now, I strategically position my snake closer to the nearest apple and ensure growing towards achieving the goal of maximizing points.\n\nNext Move: UP",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8).

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

By moving upward, I will easily reach the apple without immediate conflict with the enemy snake head. \n\nI will continue extending my strategy by moving north and align towards the apple at (4, 8). Monitor the environment for changes in enemy snake behavior and adapt accordingly to maintain safety and secure point acquisition. By choosing **UP** now, I strategically position my snake closer to the nearest apple and ensure growing towards achieving the goal of maximizing points.\n\nNext Move: UP",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

This move strengthens our growth potential by gaining the closest apple.\n\n- **Post-Move Strategy**:\n  - Proceed directly north from (4, 4) to (4, 5) to (4, 6) and finally reaching the apple at (4, 8).\n  - Monitor the progression of the enemy snake to avoid potential collision at (5, 2).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n- **Move**: UP\n\n### Future Strategy\n- Upon reaching (4, 8), continue northward to secure the apple, optimizing point gain while keeping a safe distance from enemy snake risk if it is moving into the (4, 7) space.\n  \nThis direction maximizes the potential for gaining points through apple acquisition while minimizing collision risk. By moving upward, I will easily reach the apple without immediate conflict with the enemy snake head. \n\nI will continue extending my strategy by moving north and align towards the apple at (4, 8). Monitor the environment for changes in enemy snake behavior and adapt accordingly to maintain safety and secure point acquisition. By choosing **UP** now, I strategically position my snake closer to the nearest apple and ensure growing towards achieving the goal of maximizing points.\n\nNext Move: UP",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8).

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

This choice provides growth potential and ensures area space access, reducing the risk of contention while protecting on the snake's path on the upper. \n\n### Strategy Tell\n\n- Maintain proactive growth by targeting the apples based on proximity and evaluate environment threats focusing on the Snake #1 head.\n- Strive clear up contract-based vertical paths susceptible available based on board distance dynamics.\n\n**Decided Next Move",

Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4.

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

However, it eliminates proximity to the apple below of (6, 7).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Offers growth opportunities with apple proximity at (7, 3) and (4, 8), aligning with strategic points on the board.\n   - **Cons:** Snake ID 0 cannot precisely expander room access while approaching `next apple of (5, 7)`, potentially re-engaging horizontal risk with LONGer possibility.\n\n### Decision\nThe best strategic move to consider is **UP to (7, 7)**, which actively targets an apple in the upper board proximal with minimal risk of collision with Snake #1 preparing over safe vertical limits.

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8).

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

However, it eliminates proximity to the apple below of (6, 7).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Offers growth opportunities with apple proximity at (7, 3) and (4, 8), aligning with strategic points on the board.\n   - **Cons:** Snake ID 0 cannot precisely expander room access while approaching `next apple of (5, 7)`, potentially re-engaging horizontal risk with LONGer possibility.\n\n### Decision\nThe best strategic move to consider is **UP to (7, 7)**, which actively targets an apple in the upper board proximal with minimal risk of collision with Snake #1 preparing over safe vertical limits.

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8).

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",

However, it eliminates proximity to the apple below of (6, 7).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Offers growth opportunities with apple proximity at (7, 3) and (4, 8), aligning with strategic points on the board.\n   - **Cons:** Snake ID 0 cannot precisely expander room access while approaching `next apple of (5, 7)`, potentially re-engaging horizontal risk with LONGer possibility.\n\n### Decision\nThe best strategic move to consider is **UP to (7, 7)**, which actively targets an apple in the upper board proximal with minimal risk of collision with Snake #1 preparing over safe vertical limits. This choice provides growth potential and ensures area space access, reducing the risk of contention while protecting on the snake's path on the upper. \n\n### Strategy Tell\n\n- Maintain proactive growth by targeting the apples based on proximity and evaluate environment threats focusing on the Snake #1 head.\n- Strive clear up contract-based vertical paths susceptible available based on board distance dynamics.\n\n**Decided Next Move",

This will put you above the enemy snake, but still clear of collision since they are on (5, 3).\n  - This step is crucial as it allows for the next movement to (4, 4) and then directly towards (4, 8), the closest apple.\n\n- **Future Considerations:**\n  - After moving to (4, 3), continue up to (4, 8) to secure the apple there.\n  - Monitor the enemy snake and be prepared",

This move strengthens our growth potential by gaining the closest apple.\n\n- **Post-Move Strategy**:\n  - Proceed directly north from (4, 4) to (4, 5) to (4, 6) and finally reaching the apple at (4, 8).\n  - Monitor the progression of the enemy snake to avoid potential collision at (5, 2).\n\n### Chosen Direction\n- **Move**: UP\n\n### Future Strategy\n- Upon reaching (4, 8), continue northward to secure the apple, optimizing point gain while keeping a safe distance from enemy snake risk if it is moving into the (4, 7) space.\n  \nThis direction maximizes the potential for gaining points through apple acquisition while minimizing collision risk. By moving upward, I will easily reach the apple without immediate conflict with the enemy snake head. \n\nI will continue extending my strategy by moving north and align towards the apple at (4, 8). Monitor the environment for changes in enemy snake behavior and adapt accordingly to maintain safety and secure point acquisition. By choosing **UP** now, I strategically position my snake closer to the nearest apple and ensure growing towards achieving the goal of maximizing points.\n\nNext Move: UP",

Immediate apple proximity: There\u2019s a direct apple at coordinate (4, 4), directly north of our snake\u2019s head at (4, 3).\n2. Movement risk: Moving left from (4, 3) puts the snake head at (4, 2) on the enemy snake\u2019s path at (5, 2), which could pose a collision risk.\n3. Board structure: To safely get to (4, 4), we need to avoid both going downwards and left, staying clear from the upcoming (5, 0) to (5, 1) area occupied vertically by enemy snakes.\n4. Growth optimization: By targeting the apple at (4, 4), the snake can maintain a northeast path avoiding snake walls while extending towards other apple positions at (2, 6) and (4, 8) for future growth.\n\n**Next Move**  \n*UP*\n\n**Strategy**  \nFollowing the northeast path, progress to (4, 4), then moving east to reach (4, 6), and eventually up to secure the apple at (4, 8). This path maintains a strategic growth trajectory while avoiding collisions with enemy snakes.\n\n, continually assessing board state to optimize point acquisition.\n\n**Visualization of the Current Move:**\n\n--Your snake Head--\n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \n   .

It keeps me away from the direction of the enemy snake and avoids the immediate danger of movement into potential collision areas. No path blockage is present. Potential risk with not acquiring the closest apple but is strategically sound for future growth.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**:\n  - Directly north of this position is an apple at (4, 3), which is a tempting immediate goal. However, there's a risk of running into enemy movement at (5, 2) if it moves south. Also, moving down takes me away from future nearby apples located at (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**:\n  - Moves the snake towards the center of the board but doesn't align with an immediate apple acquisition strategy. It also potentially increases vulnerability as the enemy snake might move towards this area, especially if it's trying to control the central board area.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**:\n  - Shifts me further from the lowest risk apple positions, and it moves me towards a less controlled board area prone to potential enemy control if they choose to expand rightwards. It also requires me to reverse my path to maximize growth trajectory.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Focus**: Secure apples in a manner that positions the snake for strategic future growth.\n- **Avoid Risk**: Minimize the chance of collision with enemy snakes by staying on their less-likely paths.\n- **Immediate Growth**: While the apple at (4, 4) is close, prioritizing future growth positions like (4, 8) ensures sustainable advancement.\n\n### Decision",
