The board is 10x10.\n\nApples are at: (5, 5), (8, 1), (8, 6), (4, 0), (9, 2).\n\nMy goal is to eat apples safely.\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves:\n\nMy head is at (1, 8).\n\n1. **UP**: Moves to (1, 9). This is on the board and safe.\n2. **DOWN**: Moves to (1, 7). This is on the board and safe.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves to (0, 8). This is on the board and safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (2, 8). This is on the board and safe.\n\nAll moves are immediately safe as the snake is only 1 unit long and there are no immediate obstacles or enemy bodies nearby.\n\nNow I need to decide which apple to target and which move gets me closer to an apple or a good position.\n\nNearest apples:\nA1: (5, 5) - Distance: $|5-1| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7$\nA2: (8, 1) - Distance: $|8-1| + |1-8| = 7 + 7 = 14$\nA3: (8, 6) - Distance: $|8-1| + |6-8| = 7 + 2 = 9$\nA4: (4, 0) - Distance: $|4-1| + |0-8| = 3 + 8 = 11$\nA5: (9, 2) - Distance: $|9-1| + |2-8| = 8 + 6 = 14$\n\nThe apple at (5, 5) is the closest.\n\nLet's see how the moves affect the distance to (5, 5):\n- UP to (1, 9): New distance is $|5-1| + |5-9| = 4 + 4 = 8$. (Further away)\n- DOWN to (1, 7): New distance is $|5-1| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 = 6$. (Closer)\n- LEFT to (0, 8): New distance is $|5-0| + |5-8| = 5 + 3 = 8$. (Further away)\n- RIGHT to (2, 8): New distance is $|5-2| + |5-8| = 3 + 3 = 6$. (Closer)\n\nMoves DOWN and RIGHT both reduce the distance to the closest apple (5, 5).\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake at (0, 1). It is far away from me (Manhattan distance 8) and currently located near two apples: (8, 1) and (4, 0). (8, 1) is adjacent to its row (y=1), and (4, 0) is one step away if it moves up or right. Given its position, the enemy is likely to move towards (4, 0) or (8, 1). If it moves UP, it endangers (4, 0). If it moves RIGHT, it endangers (8, 1).\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (0, 2), it's still far from me.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 1), it's still far from me.\n\nI am in the upper left corner of the board. Target (5, 5) is central.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (1, 7), I maintain a relatively high Y coordinate, allowing me flexibility to move right or continue down towards the center.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2, 8), I maintain a relatively high Y coordinate, allowing me flexibility to move down or continue right.\n\nThe apple (5, 5) is far enough that I don't need to worry about the enemy contesting it immediately.\n\nChoosing RIGHT (to (2, 8)) positions me well for moving toward (5, 5) later (e.g., (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (4, 7) ...). It also gives me access to the apple at (8, 6) which is the second closest.\n\nChoosing DOWN (to (1, 7)) positions me well for moving toward (5, 5) later (e.g., (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (2, 6) ...).\n\nBoth seem equally good for reaching (5, 5).\n\nSince I am on the left edge (x=1), moving RIGHT expands my playing field and opens up pathing options towards the center-right side where (5, 5) and (8, 6) are located. Moving DOWN keeps me close to the left edge, which might restrict movement later if I needed to go further right.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to start moving towards the center of the board.\n\nMy planned sequence to (5, 5) starting with RIGHT:\n(1, 8) -> RIGHT -> (2, 8)\n(2, 8) -> RIGHT -> (3, 8)\n(3, 8) -> RIGHT -> (4, 8)\n(4, 8) -> DOWN -> (4, 7)\n(4, 7) -> DOWN -> (4, 6)\n(4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5)\n(4, 5) -> RIGHT -> (5, 5) (Apple)\n\nThis sequence takes 7 turns, assuming no detours.\n\nPlan: Move right towards the center for the first few moves, targeting (5, 5).\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Apple Goals**\nTarget Apple: (5, 5) (Closest in previous turn, central location).\n\nCurrent Manhattan distances to apples from (2, 8):\nA1: (5, 5) - $|5-2| + |5-8| = 3 + 3 = 6$ (Target)\nA2: (8, 1) - $|8-2| + |1-8| = 6 + 7 = 13$\nA3: (8, 6) - $|8-2| + |6-8| = 6 + 2 = 8$\nA4: (4, 0) - $|4-2| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10$\nA5: (9, 2) - $|9-2| + |2-8| = 7 + 6 = 13$\n\n(5, 5) is still the closest. (8, 6) is the next closest.\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves towards Target (5, 5)**\n\n- UP to (2, 9): New distance $|5-2| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7$. (Further)\n- DOWN to (2, 7): New distance $|5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5$. (Closer)\n- LEFT to (1, 8): New distance $|5-1| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7$. (Further)\n- RIGHT to (3, 8): New distance $|5-3| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5$. (Closer)\n\nMoves DOWN and RIGHT both reduce the distance to (5, 5).\n\n**4. Strategic Considerations**\n\nI am currently at (2, 8). The strategy is to move toward the center (5, 5) where I have a good chance of eating an apple uncontested.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 8):** This continues movement along the top edge, gaining X distance towards 5. It puts me in a good position to either continue RIGHT or begin moving DOWN later.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 7):** This starts movement towards the center on the Y axis. It puts me one step closer to (5, 5) right now and also closer to (8, 6) (new distance $6 + 1 = 7$).\n\nBoth moves are equally aggressive towards the primary target (5, 5).\n\nLet's look at the secondary target (8, 6):\n- RIGHT to (3, 8): New distance 8. (No change)\n- DOWN to (2, 7): New distance $|8-2| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7$. (Closer)\n\nMoving DOWN gives slightly better positioning for both (5, 5) and (8, 6) by immediately reducing the Y coordinate necessary for both targets. It focuses on the Y descent now, which I need to do eventually.\n\nEnemy snake ID 0 is at (0, 2). It is far away from both my current location and my target apples. It moved UP, likely targeting (4, 0) (4 steps away) or (8, 1) (9 steps away). Moving UP suggests it is looking to move right or continue up. If it goes RIGHT to (1, 2), it is still mostly confined to the bottom/left corner. I don't need to worry about collision or immediate contention.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 7) feels like a slightly better decision as it immediately begins the Y-coordinate reduction needed to reach the center of the board.\n\nCurrent Plan: Move DOWN, then continue to zig-zag towards (5, 5).\n(2, 8) -> DOWN -> (2, 7)\n(2, 7) -> (Need to decide if I go R or D next) R seems better: (3, 7)\n(3, 7) -> (4, 7)\n(4, 7) -> (4, 6)\n(4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 5)\n\nThis path seems efficient.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

(Further: 1 step further on X)\n- RIGHT to (3, 7): New distance $|5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4$. (Closer: 1 step closer on X)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to the primary target (5, 5) by 1 step, resulting in a new distance of 4.\n\n**4. Strategic Considerations and Tie-breaking**\n\nI am at (2, 7). Target (5, 5).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 6):** Focuses on Y coordinate descent.\n    *   Distance to (8, 6) changes from 7 to $|8-2| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6$. (Closer)\n    *   Puts the snake more centrally on the X axis, but still far from 5.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 7):** Focuses on X coordinate ascent.\n    *   Distance to (8, 6) changes from 7 to $|8-3| + |6-7| = 5 + 1 = 6$. (Closer)\n    *   Positions the snake better for future DOWN moves (e.g., (3, 6) then (4, 6) or (4, 5)).\n\nBoth moves are equally good for (5, 5) and (8, 6).\n\nLet's consider the long-term path to (5, 5). I need 3 steps right and 2 steps down.\nPath 1: Go RIGHT first. (2, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 5). (Total 5 steps)\nPath 2: Go DOWN first. (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 5). (Total 5 steps)\n\nThe crucial difference is that moving RIGHT now positions me to make continuous progress towards the X=5 target coordinate (3, 7). From (3, 7), I will likely choose RIGHT (to 4, 7) next turn, continuing to advance X.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 6), then next turn I am at (2, 6). If I move RIGHT (to 3, 6), I have started my X increase.\n\nThe benefit of moving RIGHT first: It keeps me slightly higher on the board, potentially enabling faster movement across the X dimension where there is more board space towards the center. Since I need more X steps (3) than Y steps (2), prioritizing the increase in X seems marginally better.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 0) is at (0, 3) and is moving up the left edge. It is still far from my target (5, 5) and (8, 6). Its probable targets are (4, 0) (distance 7) or it might turn right towards (5, 5) (distance 7, if it moves to (1, 3)). If it moves RIGHT to (1, 3), it poses no immediate threat to me at (3, 7).\n\nI will choose RIGHT to advance my X coordinate towards the target X=5.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving towards (5, 5) via (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), then drop down.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake (0) is at (1, 3). No current path leads to a direct collision with the enemy head or body.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Goals**\nTarget Apple: (5, 5).\n\nCurrent Manhattan distances to apples from (3, 7):\nA1: (5, 5) - $|5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4$ (Target)\nA2: (8, 1) - $|8-3| + |1-7| = 5 + 6 = 11$\nA3: (8, 6) - $|8-3| + |6-7| = 5 + 1 = 6$\nA4: (4, 0) - $|4-3| + |0-7| = 1 + 7 = 8$\nA5: (9, 2) - $|9-3| + |2-7| = 6 + 5 = 11$\n\n(5, 5) remains the closest apple, distance 4. (8, 6) is the second closest, distance 6.\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves towards Target (5, 5)**\n\nCurrent location (3, 7). Target (5, 5). We need to increase X (towards 5) and decrease Y (towards 5).\n\nGoal: Choose a move that reduces the distance 4.\n\n- UP to (3, 8): New distance $|5-3| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5$. (Worse, increases Y distance)\n- DOWN to (3, 6): New distance $|5-3| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Better, decreases Y distance)\n- LEFT to (2, 7): New distance $|5-2| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5$. (Worse, increases X distance)\n- RIGHT to (4, 7): New distance $|5-4| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (Better, decreases X distance)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to (5, 5) from 4 to 3.\n\n**4. Strategic Consideration and Tie-breaking**\n\nI am at (3, 7). Target (5, 5).\nI need 2 steps Right and 2 steps Down.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 6):** Advances on Y. This puts me closer to the row Y=6, which is aligned with the secondary target (8, 6).\n    *   New distance to (8, 6): $|8-3| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5$ (Closer than before, D=6).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 7):** Advances on X. This puts me one step away from the X=5 target coordinate.\n    *   New distance to (8, 6): $|8-4| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5$ (Closer than before, D=6).\n\nBoth moves are excellent. They both reduce distance to (5, 5) and (8, 6) equally well.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (4, 7): Next turn, I can move DOWN (4, 6) or RIGHT (5, 7).\n    *   RIGHT (5, 7): Distance to (5, 5) is 2. Then DOWN (5, 6), then DOWN (5, 5). Total 3 steps.\nIf I choose DOWN (3, 6): Next turn, I can move DOWN (3, 5) or RIGHT (4, 6).\n    *   RIGHT (4, 6): Distance to (5, 5) is 2. Then RIGHT (5, 6), then DOWN (5, 5). Total 3 steps.\n\nSince the number of remaining X steps (2) and Y steps (2) are identical, there is no inherent preference between advancing X or Y first regarding minimizing path length.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT towards (4, 7) takes me further away from the enemy snake (0) which is at (1, 3). If Snake 0 attempts to intercept (4, 0), it will likely move to (2, 3) or (1, 2). Moving right keeps me on the top half of the board and provides more room to maneuver compared to moving down immediately and potentially getting closer to the enemy.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum of increasing the X coordinate started last turn.\n\nI will move RIGHT to (4, 7). From there, I will be one step away from X=5, which is the column containing my target apple (5, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue towards (5, 5). Move RIGHT to (4, 7). If moving RIGHT to (5, 7) is safe next turn, prioritize that to reach the X coordinate, then drop down.\n\nRIGHT",

(Worse)\n- RIGHT to (5, 7): New distance $|5-5| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2$. (Better, decreases X distance, hits X=5 column)\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT reduce the distance to (5, 5) from 3 to 2.\n\n**4. Strategic Consideration and Tie-breaking**\n\nI am at (4, 7). Target (5, 5). I need 1 step Right and 2 steps Down.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 7):** Immediately reaches the target X coordinate (5). From here, I need two steps down to (5, 5). Path: (5, 7) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 5). Total 2 steps.\n    *   Distance to (8, 6): $|8-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (Closer than D=5)\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 6):** Advances on Y. This is the path needed for the second closest apple (8, 6), as it maintains X=4 and gets close to Y=6. Path to (5, 5): (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 5). Total 2 steps.\n    *   Distance to (8, 6): $|8-4| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4$. (Closer than D=5)\n\nBoth moves achieve the apple (5, 5) in 2 steps.\n\nLet's consider the flow of coordinates:\nRIGHT to (5, 7) is one horizontal movement followed by two vertical movements.\nDOWN to (4, 6) is one vertical movement followed by one horizontal, followed by another vertical.\n\nMoving RIGHT achieves the X coordinate immediately, setting up for a straight vertical drop. This can often be marginally easier to path.\n\nFurthermore, let's look at the enemy Snake 0 at (1, 2).\nSnake 0's closest apple is (4, 0), distance 5. Or (5, 5), distance 7. Or (8, 1), distance 8. Snake 0 is likely heading towards (4, 0).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP/RIGHT/DOWN towards (4, 0), it might move to (2, 2) or (1, 3) or (0, 2).\n\nMy position (4, 7) is currently far from the enemy. Moving RIGHT to (5, 7) keeps me far and central/safe. Moving DOWN to (4, 6) is also safe.\n\nSince the ultimate goal is (5, 5) and moving RIGHT to (5, 7) locks in the X coordinate needed, I choose RIGHT. This sets me up for a clean move sequence: RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN to eat the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (5, 7). Next turn, move DOWN to (5, 6). The turn after, move DOWN to (5, 5) and eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Check Enemy Snake 0 Position**\nEnemy 0 is at (1, 0).\nEnemy 0's closest apples:\nA4: (4, 0) - D=3\nA2: (8, 1) - D=8\nA5: (9, 2) - D=10\n\nSnake 0 is very likely targeting (4, 0) by moving RIGHT to (2, 0) or UP/RIGHT to (2, 1) or staying put/moving LEFT/UP slightly (less likely). If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 0), the distance to (4, 0) becomes 2.\n\nWe are nowhere near Snake 0, so moving DOWN to (5, 5) is safe and maximizes score immediately.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nMove DOWN to eat the apple at (5, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** After eating the apple at (5, 5) (length 2, head (5, 5), tail (5, 6)), the next closest apple is (8, 6) at distance $3$. I should focus on moving RIGHT and then UP towards (8, 6).\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Moves towards Target (8, 6)**\n\nInitial step towards (8, 6) requires moving RIGHT (to increase X) or UP (to increase Y). However, UP is blocked by my body.\n\nCandidate moves and resulting distances to (8, 6):\n- RIGHT to (6, 5): $D = |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Shortest distance)\n- LEFT to (4, 5): $D = |8-4| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5$. (Moving away)\n- DOWN to (5, 4): $D = |8-5| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5$. (Moving away in Y, neutral in X)\n\nMoving RIGHT (6, 5) is the clear optimal choice for approaching (8, 6).\n\n**4. Check Enemy Snake 0 Position**\nEnemy 0 is at (1, 1). It is length 1.\nEnemy 0's likely targets: (8, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0).\n(4, 0) D=5, (3, 0) D=5, (8, 1) D=7. (1, 1) is closest to (4, 0) and (3, 0).\n\nSnake 0 movement prediction:\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 1), its distance to (4, 0) is 4, (3, 0) is 4.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 0), its distance to (4, 0) is 3, (3, 0) is 2. (This looks highly likely if it wants (3, 0) or (4, 0)).\n\nMy current move is RIGHT to (6, 5). This keeps me far away from Snake 0. There is virtually no collision risk.\n\n**5. Long-term consideration**\nBy moving RIGHT to (6, 5), I am positioned to move RIGHT again (7, 5) and then UP (7, 6 or 8, 6). This leads efficiently to (8, 6).\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe safest and most efficient move toward the nearest apple (8, 6) is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Moves towards Target (8, 6)**\n\nInitial step towards (8, 6) requires moving RIGHT (to increase X) or UP (to increase Y).\n\nCandidate moves and resulting distances to (8, 6):\n- RIGHT to (7, 5): $D = |8-7| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2$. (Decreases distance)\n- UP to (6, 6): $D = |8-6| + |6-6| = 2 + 0 = 2$. (Decreases distance)\n- DOWN to (6, 4): $D = |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4$. (Increases distance)\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP are optimal for approaching (8, 6).\n\n**4. Tie Breaker: Future positioning and freedom**\n- If I move RIGHT to (7, 5): Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (8, 5) (D=1) or UP to (7, 6) (which is further from (8, 6), D=2). Moving to (8, 5) sets me up for a final UP move to (8, 6).\n- If I move UP to (6, 6): Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7, 6) (D=1) or UP to (6, 7) (D=3). Moving to (7, 6) sets me up for a final RIGHT move to (8, 6).\n\nBoth paths take 2 turns to reach the apple's location (assuming no obstacle/collision).\n\nPath 1 (RIGHT): (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6) (3 moves total)\nPath 2 (UP): (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) (3 moves total)\nWait, let's re-evaluate distance 3.\n\n(6, 5) to (8, 6). Target (8, 6).\nIf RIGHT to (7, 5): D=2. From (7, 5), (8, 6) achieved by RIGHT (8, 5) (D=1), then UP (8, 6) (D=0). Total 3 moves.\nIf UP to (6, 6): D=2. From (6, 6), (8, 6) achieved by RIGHT (7, 6) (D=1), then RIGHT (8, 6) (D=0). Total 3 moves.\n\nThe move RIGHT (7, 5) keeps me slightly lower on the board, which might keep options open to look at (8, 1) or (9, 2) later, but that is minor.\n\nThe apple (8, 6) is in the 6th row. Moving UP to (6, 6) gets me closer to the height of the apple immediately. Moving RIGHT keeps me on the 5th row for one more turn. Given the position of the apple (8, 6), moving UP seems like a marginally better step to secure the Y coordinate first.\n\nLet's check for enemy interference.\n\n**5. Enemy Prediction (Snake 0)**\nEnemy 0 is at (0, 1). Possible moves: (0, 0), (1, 1).\nTargets for Snake 0: (4, 0) D=5, (3, 0) D=5, (8, 1) D=7, (9, 2) D=10.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (0, 0): D to (4, 0) = 4, D to (3, 0) = 3.\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (1, 1): D to (4, 0) = 4, D to (3, 0) = 4.\n\nIt is likely aiming for (3, 0) or (4, 0), and will move DOWN or RIGHT. It is extremely far from my objective (8, 6) and my current location (6, 5). No collision risk.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead efficiently to the target (8, 6). I choose UP to acquire the necessary Y coordinate for the apple early.\n\nUP\nUP",

Conclusion**\nThe move RIGHT to (7, 6) is safe, optimal for reducing distance to the primary target (8, 6) (reducing D from 2 to 1), and keeps my options open for the next turn (where I will likely move RIGHT again to land on the apple).\n\nRIGHT",

Length 1.\nApples are at: (8, 1), (8, 6), (4, 0), (9, 2), (3, 0).\nCurrent strategy: Move towards the closest apple (8, 6) to eat it this turn.\n\n**1. Safety Check**\nMy head is at (7, 6). My body segment is at (6, 6).\n\nThe board is 10x10 (0-9).\n\nPossible moves:\n1. UP: (7, 7) - Safe (on board, not into any snake).\n2. DOWN: (7, 5) - Safe.\n3. LEFT: (6, 6) - **Kills me**. Moving into my own body segment.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 6) - Safe. This cell contains Apple A2.\n\nMoves LEFT is disallowed. The safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Goals**\nCurrent location (7, 6). Target apple (8, 6).\n\nApples (A) and Manhattan Distances (D) from (7, 6):\nA1: (8, 1) - $D = |8-7| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6$\nA2: (8, 6) - $D = |8-7| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1$ (Closest)\nA3: (4, 0) - $D = |4-7| + |0-6| = 3 + 6 = 9$\nA4: (9, 2) - $D = |9-7| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6$\nA5: (3, 0) - $D = |3-7| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10$\n\nThe closest apple is (8, 6) at D=1.\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves towards Target (8, 6)**\n\nTarget (8, 6) is one step RIGHT.\n\n- RIGHT to (8, 6): Directly hits the apple. This is the optimal move.\n\n**4. Considering Enemy Interaction (Snake 0)**\nEnemy 0 is at (0, 1). It is 8 units away horizontally and 5 vertically from (8, 6). It cannot reach (8, 6) this turn. It is focused on the far left apples (3, 0) or (4, 0). There is no danger of a head-on collision at (8, 6).\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe move RIGHT to (8, 6) is safe and guarantees eating an apple, increasing my score and length.\n\n**Long Term Plan (Post-Apple (8, 6))**\nAfter eating (8, 6), my head will be at (8, 6) and my body will be [(7, 6), (6, 6)] (Length 3).\nThe remaining available apples are (8, 1), (4, 0), (9, 2), and (3, 0).\nFrom (8, 6):\nA1: (8, 1) $D=5$. Requires 5 DOWN moves.\nA4: (9, 2) $D=1+4=5$.\nA3: (4, 0) $D=4+6=10$.\n\nThe new closest apples are (8, 1) and (9, 2), both D=5. (8, 1) is straight down, which is often easier to navigate. I will aim for (8, 1) next.\n\nRIGHT",
