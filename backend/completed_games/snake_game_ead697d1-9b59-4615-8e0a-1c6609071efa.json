No head\u2011on collision is possible.\n\n- **Apple strategy**  \n  The nearest uncontested apple is at (7,\u202f0). Moving **DOWN** puts us on a straight vertical line toward that apple while keeping us on the left side of the board, far from the enemy\u2019s current position.\n\n- **Future mobility**  \n  From (2,\u202f7) we can continue moving down until we reach y\u202f\u2248\u202f0, then turn right toward (7,\u202f0). This path leaves many escape routes (left, right, or further down) and avoids the crowded top\u2011right area where the enemy is likely to collect the apple at (8,\u202f9).\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**\n\n1. Turn\u202f9 \u2013 **DOWN** to (2,\u202f7) (this move).  \n2. Turn\u202f10 \u2013 Continue **DOWN** to (2,\u202f6).  \n3. Turn\u202f11 \u2013 Continue **DOWN** to (2,\u202f5).  \n4. Keep moving **DOWN** until y\u202f\u2248\u202f0, then evaluate the enemy\u2019s position and turn **RIGHT** toward the apple at (7,\u202f0). While descending, always check that the enemy\u2019s head is not moving into our path; if a head\u2011on risk appears, abort the plan and choose a safe alternative direction.\n\nDOWN",
