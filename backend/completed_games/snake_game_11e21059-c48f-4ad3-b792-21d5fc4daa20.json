The apples remaining are at (5, 5), (6, 7), (9, 2), and (1, 1). My current tail consists of (3,9), (4,8), 4,7).\n\nMy immediate goal is to maximize points by eating apples. Direct paths to the apples are:\n- To (5,5): DOWN, DOWN, LEFT.\n- To (6,7): DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT\n- To (9,2): DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\n- To (1,1): LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN\n\nSnake #1 seems relatively harmless for now, so I'll focus on grabbing apples. Apple (5,5) is closest, so I'll move down twice and then left. However, carefully consider about self-collision: my body ends at (4,7).\n\nGoing DOWN twice takes me to position (2,9). Moving LEFT from there places me at (1,9). This does not lead directly to another apple and it also takes me away from the good apples towards the bottom.\n\nLet's assess the position after another move. My intention is to acquire an apple. The two most promising are (5,5) and (6,7).\n\nAfter one move UP, I\u2019d be at (5, 9).\nAfter one move DOWN, I would be at (3, 9).\nAfter one move LEFT, I\u2019d be at (4, 8).\nAfter one move RIGHT, I\u2019d be at (5, 8).\n\nMoving RIGHT from (4,9) onto (5,8) is leading toward the apple at (5,5) if I continue DOWN. I will choose to go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",
