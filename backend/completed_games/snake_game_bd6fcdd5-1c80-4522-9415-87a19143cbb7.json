Now let me consider which is strategically best.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLooking at apple locations, there's a cluster of 3 apples on the right side of the board: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2). I'm already at x=8, so moving vertically down toward these apples makes sense.\n\n- **DOWN** to (8, 5): Moves me closer to the apple cluster at (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2). This is a direct path toward multiple apples.\n- **UP** to (8, 7): Moves me toward apples (1, 8) and (1, 7), but those are far away (distance 7).\n- **LEFT** to (7, 6): Moves away from the nearest apple cluster.\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 6): Moves to the edge, limiting future mobility.\n\nThe enemy snake at (9, 5) is close to me. If I move DOWN to (8, 5), they're at (9, 5), so we won't collide. Moving DOWN keeps me on a path toward the concentrated apple cluster while maintaining good mobility.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Focus on collecting the 3 apples at (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2) by moving down. This gives me a quick path to grow. After that, reassess the board and hunt for the remaining apples at (1, 7) and (1, 8).\n\nDOWN",
