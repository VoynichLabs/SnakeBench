          "rationale": "First, I need to assess the current game state. The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake (ID 1) is at (2,2) with no body segments, so I have an empty body except for my head. The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (3,2) with no body segments. Apples are scattered around the board as listed.\n\nApples are at: (8,9), (2,6), (0,9), (1,7), (5,9), (0,4), (8,8), (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (5,7), (2,4), (0,2). I see there's an apple at (0,2), which is very close to my position at (2,2). However, I also have an enemy snake right next to me at (3,2). Since both snakes have no body, we can move freely without worrying about our own bodies, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nImportant rules: All snakes move simultaneously. If I move into an enemy snake's head or body, I die. If two heads move into the same cell, both die. Also, if I move into an apple, I grow and gain a point. The game ends when a snake reaches 30 apples, but we're only at turn 0 with 0 apples, so that's not imminent. The game lasts at most 150 turns, so we have time.\n\nMy immediate goal is to collect apples without dying. Since my body is empty, I have no constraints from my own body except that moving directly backwards into my own body isn't possible because there's no body behind me. But if I were to grow, that would change in future turns.\n\nLet's consider the board from the given representation. Rows are from y=9 at the top to y=0 at the bottom. Columns from x=0 to x=9. The board state is given with A for apples, numbers for snake heads (1 for me, 0 for enemy), and dots for empty spaces. Let me map it out:\n\nRow 9 (y=9): A . . . . . A . . A .  -> apples at (0,9)? Wait, the string says \"9 A . . . . A . . A .\" so let's parse: positions along x from 0 to 9: (0,9)=A, (1,9)=., (2,9)=., (3,9)=., (4,9)=., (5,9)=A, (6,9)=., (7,9)=., (8,9)=A, (9,9)=.  Wait, the string has 10 characters? Let's count: \"9 A . . . . A . . A .\" - that's 11 items? Actually, the board state is shown as lines with the row number and then 10 symbols. Let's list all rows:\n\nRow 9: \"9 A . . . . A . . A .\" -> positions: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:.   But the string ends with a space and a dot? Actually, looking carefully: \"9 A . . . . A . . A .\" likely means: x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: A, x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: A, x=9: .   That's 10 symbols. The last part might be \"A .\" with a space, but it's probably A at x=8 and . at x=9. Let's confirm with the apples list: (8,9) is an apple, so x=8,y=9 is A. Also (0,9) is an apple, so x=0,y=9 is A. So yes, row 9: A at 0,5,8? Wait, from the list: apples at (8,9), (0,9), (5,9) so yes. So row 9: (0,9)=A, (5,9)=A, (8,9)=A. Good.\n\nRow 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . A .\" -> so (8,8)=A? The apples list has (8,8), so yes. Also (0,8) is empty? Actually, the string has A at position 8? Let's see: \". . . . . . . . A .\" that's 9 dots? No: \"8 . . . . . . . . A .\" - likely 9 symbols? Let's count: after 8 there are 10 symbols? Actually, the pattern is: row number, then 10 symbols separated by spaces. So for row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . A .\" -> symbols: x=0:., x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:.   So (8,8)=A, which matches apples list.\n\nRow 7: \"7 . A . . . A . . . .\" -> (1,7)=A? Actually, apples list has (1,7) and (5,7). So (1,7)=A, (5,7)=A. Yes.\n\nRow 6: \"6 . . A . . . . . . .\" -> (2,6)=A? Apples list has (2,6). Yes.\n\nRow 5: \"5 . . . . . . . . . A\" -> (9,5)=A? Apples list has (9,5). Yes.\n\nRow 4: \"4 A . A . . . . . . .\" -> (0,4)=A, (2,4)=A? Apples list has (0,4) and (2,4). Yes.\n\nRow 3: \"3 . . . . . . . A . A\" -> (7,3)=A, (9,3)=A? Apples list has (7,3) and (9,3). Yes.\n\nRow 2: \"2 A . 1 0 . . . . . .\" -> so (0,2)=A, (2,2)=1 (my head), (3,2)=0 (enemy head). Apples list has (0,2). Yes.\n\nRow 1: \"1 . . . . . . . . . .\" -> all empty.\n\nRow 0: \"0 . . . . A A . . . .\" -> (4,0)=A, (5,0)=A? Apples list has (4,0) and (5,0). Yes.\n\nSo the board is correctly interpreted.\n\nNow, my head is at (2,2). Possible moves: UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2). But (3,2) is occupied by enemy snake head, so moving RIGHT would mean my head moves into (3,2) at the same time as the enemy head is there. Since both heads would occupy the same cell, that's a head-on collision, and both snakes die. That's bad for me, so I should avoid that move because I want to survive. The rule says: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" So moving RIGHT is suicidal and would kill me immediately. Therefore, RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow, check other moves for immediate death:\n\n- UP to (2,3): Is there any snake body there? My body is empty. Enemy body is empty. So no body collision. Is it on the board? Yes, (2,3) is within 0-9. So UP is safe.\n\n- DOWN to (2,1): Similarly, no body, on board. Safe.\n\n- LEFT to (1,2): No body, on board. Safe.\n\nSo all three remaining moves are safe in terms of immediate collision.\n\nNow, I need to consider apples and long-term strategy. I want to collect apples to grow and eventually win. The enemy snake is at (3,2), which is very close. Since the enemy also moves simultaneously, I need to anticipate where the enemy might move. The enemy's goal is also to collect apples and survive. From the enemy's perspective, they are at (3,2). Possible moves: UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2). Note that LEFT would move into my current head position (2,2). If the enemy moves LEFT and I stay still or move elsewhere, we might have a collision? Actually, if enemy moves LEFT to (2,2) and I move somewhere else, then enemy head enters my current head position, but I'm no longer there. However, since we move simultaneously, if I move away, my head leaves (2,2), so enemy head would move into an empty cell (since my body is empty, there's no body at (2,2) after I leave). But if I move into a cell that the enemy head also moves into, then both die. So I need to consider that the enemy might move in a way that causes a head-on collision with me.\n\nAlso, if the enemy moves into a cell that I move into, both die. So I should try to avoid paths where both heads could collide.\n\nLet's think about apples. The nearest apple to me is at (0,2) on the same row to the left. Also, (2,4) is above? Actually, (2,4) is at y=4, so two steps up from (2,2). (1,7) is far. (0,4) is left and up. (5,0) is down and right. (5,7) is up and right. There are many apples.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,2), I would be closer to the apple at (0,2). From (1,2), I could then move LEFT to (0,2) next turn to eat that apple. But the enemy is at (3,2). If I move LEFT, the enemy might move LEFT as well to (2,2), but since I'm moving to (1,2), we wouldn't collide unless the enemy moves to (1,2) simultaneously. That's unlikely because the enemy is at (3,2), so to reach (1,2) in one move, they would need to move LEFT twice, which is impossible. So enemy moving to (1,2) is not possible in one turn. However, if enemy moves LEFT to (2,2) and I move LEFT to (1,2), then no collision. But note: if enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), that cell is currently occupied by my head, but since we move simultaneously, my head leaves, so it becomes empty. So that's safe.\n\nBut there's another consideration: if I move LEFT to (1,2), what about future moves? From (1,2), I have options: UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2) (apple), RIGHT back to (2,2) but that might be occupied by enemy if he moved there? Actually, after move, positions update. So it depends on enemy's move.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (2,3), I'm going towards the center. From (2,3), I can access apples like (2,4) or (0,4) or (1,7). Also, moving DOWN to (2,1) might lead to apples like (5,0) or (4,0), but that's further down.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake. The enemy is at (3,2). They likely want to collect apples too. What apples are near them? (5,0) is down-right, (4,0) is left-down, (7,3) is right-up, (9,3) is far right, (5,7) is up-right, etc. The enemy might move to collect an apple. They might also consider moving towards me to block or attack? But since both are zero apples, maybe they focus on apples.\n\nI should think about the board and potential traps. With an empty body, there's no risk of hitting my own body except if I grow, which will happen when I eat an apple. So I need to be careful not to trap myself later.\n\nAnother important rule: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" Since my body is empty, if I eat an apple, I will grow by one segment. That means after eating, my body will have one segment (the previous head position). So if I eat an apple, I need to remember that my body will be behind me, and I could die if I move back into it in the future.\n\nCurrently, I have no body, so I don't have that risk yet.\n\nLet's evaluate each move option:\n\n1. LEFT to (1,2):\n   - Pros: Closer to apple at (0,2). I can eat it next turn by moving LEFT again. Also, from (1,2), I have three open directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT to apple, RIGHT back). That gives flexibility.\n   - Cons: Moving towards the edge. If I go to (0,2) and eat the apple, I will have a body segment at (1,2) afterward. That might trap me if I'm near the left wall. But (0,2) is on the left edge, so after eating, I would be at (0,2) with body behind at (1,2). From (0,2), I can only go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (back into my body). But moving RIGHT into (1,2) would be moving backwards into my own body, which kills me. So I would have to go UP or DOWN. That might be okay, but I need to ensure those paths are open. Up to (0,3) is empty? From board, (0,3) is not listed as an apple and is empty? Actually, row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . A . A\" so (0,3) is empty. Down to (0,1) is empty? Row 1: all empty. So that seems okay. But I need to consider if the enemy might move into those cells to block or cause collision.\n\n   - Collision risk: If enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), I'm moving to (1,2), so no collision. If enemy moves UP or DOWN, no issue. If enemy moves RIGHT, no issue. So low immediate collision risk.\n\n2. UP to (2,3):\n   - Pros: Moves towards center, opening up more apple options like (2,4), (1,7), etc. Also, from (2,3), I can go to (2,4) which has an apple. (2,4) is at (2,4), which is directly above two steps. So from (2,3), next move UP to (2,4) would eat apple. (2,3) is empty currently? From board, row 3 has (0,3) empty, (1,3) empty, (2,3) empty, etc. So safe.\n   - Cons: Might move closer to enemy if enemy goes UP? Enemy is at (3,2), so if both move UP, we could be at (2,3) and (3,3) respectively, not colliding. But if enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), that's where I was, so no collision. However, if I move UP to (2,3) and enemy moves UP to (3,3), then we are adjacent. Not immediate danger.\n   - From (2,3), I have four directions: UP to (2,4) apple, DOWN back to (2,2) but that might be occupied by enemy if he moved there, LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3) which could be occupied by enemy if he moved UP. So I need to be cautious.\n\n3. DOWN to (2,1):\n   - Pros: Moves towards bottom apples like (4,0), (5,0). (2,1) is empty. From there, I can go DOWN to (2,0) which is empty? Row 0: (2,0) is empty? Row 0: \"0 . . . . A A . . . .\" so (0,0) empty, (1,0) empty, (2,0) empty, (3,0) empty, (4,0)=A, (5,0)=A. So (2,0) is empty. So I could move DOWN to (2,0) and then right towards (4,0) or (5,0). But those apples are a few steps away.\n   - Cons: Moving away from many apples on the top and left. Also, moving down might lead me towards the enemy if the enemy also moves down? Enemy at (3,2), if enemy moves DOWN to (3,1), then we are at (2,1) and (3,1) - adjacent. Not immediate collision.\n   - From (2,1), I have four directions: UP back to (2,2), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), RIGHT to (3,1) which might be occupied by enemy if he moves DOWN.\n\nNow, I also need to consider the enemy's possible moves and try to outmaneuver them. Since it's turn 0, the enemy might have a strategy. I should consider what moves the enemy might make to eat apples or to attack me. The enemy might want to eat apples too. The apple at (0,2) is close to both of us? Actually, from enemy at (3,2), (0,2) is three steps left, while from me at (2,2), it's two steps left. So I have a slight advantage in reaching (0,2) sooner if I move left. The enemy might also go for that apple, but they would need three moves, so they can't beat me to it if I go for it now. However, the enemy might go for a different apple.\n\nWhat apples are close to enemy? (5,0) is down-right, (4,0) is down-left, (7,3) is right-up, (9,3) is far, (5,7) is up-right. The nearest apple for enemy is probably (4,0) or (5,0) at distance? From (3,2) to (4,0): down 2, right 1, so not adjacent. To (7,3): right 4, up 1. To (5,7): right 2, up 5. So (4,0) might be the closest in terms of Manhattan distance? Actually, (4,0) is at distance |3-4|+|2-0|=1+2=3. (5,0) is distance 2+2=4. (7,3) is 4+1=5. So (4,0) is closest. But also (2,4) is an apple that I could go for, which is closer to me? (2,4) is distance |2-2|+|2-4|=0+2=2 from me, while for enemy it's |3-2|+|2-4|=1+2=3. So I have an advantage on (2,4) as well.\n\nNow, considering the game strategy: I want to collect apples safely and possibly block the enemy or force them into traps. Since the board is 10x10 and there are many apples, I should focus on securing apples that are nearby and safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,2), I can immediately threaten the apple at (0,2). The enemy might try to intercept? They can't reach (0,2) in one move from (3,2). They could move LEFT to (2,2) but that would be just behind me. If I then move LEFT to (0,2) and eat the apple, I grow. Then my body will be at (1,2). The enemy at (2,2) after my first move? Actually, if I move LEFT to (1,2) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), then positions: me at (1,2), enemy at (2,2). Then if I move LEFT to (0,2) to eat apple, I would be moving into (0,2). Enemy might move UP, DOWN, or LEFT? If enemy moves LEFT to (1,2), that would be where I just left, but I'm moving to (0,2), so no collision. However, if enemy moves LEFT to (1,2) and I move LEFT to (0,2), then enemy head moves into my body? But my body is currently empty because I haven't grown yet? Actually, when I eat an apple, I grow after the move. So during the move, my body is still empty. So if I move from (1,2) to (0,2) and eat apple, after the move, my body includes (1,2). But during the move, enemy head moving into (1,2) would find it empty (since I left), so no collision. However, after the move, if enemy is at (1,2) and my body is now at (1,2), that means enemy head is on my body? But rule: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So after the move, if enemy head is on my body, enemy dies. But since we move simultaneously, we need to check the state after moves. Let's think: Before moves: me at (1,2) (after first move), enemy at (2,2). Then for second move: I plan to move LEFT to (0,2). Enemy might move LEFT to (1,2). At the start of the move, my body is empty (since I haven't eaten apple yet). During the move, I move from (1,2) to (0,2). Enemy moves from (2,2) to (1,2). After moves, my head is at (0,2), and since I ate an apple, I grow, so my body now includes (1,2) (the previous head position). Enemy head is at (1,2). So after the move, enemy head is on my body (the segment at (1,2)). Therefore, enemy would die. That could be a good outcome for me: I eat an apple and kill the enemy. However, I need to be careful: if the enemy moves into (1,2) on that same turn, and I am moving from (1,2) to (0,2), is there a collision? Since we move simultaneously, my head leaves (1,2) and enemy head enters (1,2). The cell is empty at the start of the move? Actually, at the start, I am at (1,2). So if enemy moves into (1,2) while I am still there, that would be a head-on collision? But I am moving away simultaneously. The rule says: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" Here, I am moving from (1,2) to (0,2), so I am moving into (0,2). Enemy is moving from (2,2) to (1,2). So we are moving into different cells. There is no single cell that both heads are moving into. So no head-on collision. After the move, enemy head is at (1,2) and my body is at (1,2). Since enemy head is on my body, enemy dies. That is allowed: enemy dies, I survive. So this is a potential trap for the enemy if they follow me. However, I cannot assume the enemy will make that move. The enemy might choose a different move to avoid that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,2), the enemy might anticipate that and instead of moving LEFT, they might move UP or DOWN to avoid being lured. They might go for an apple in another direction.\n\nNow, if I move UP to (2,3), I might avoid the immediate apple but open up other options. Also, moving UP might make me less vulnerable to the enemy moving towards me. However, the apple at (0,2) is still there, and I might lose the chance to get it easily if the enemy decides to go for it. But since the enemy is farther, they can't get it in one move. So I have time.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,1), I'm going away from the apple at (0,2) and towards apples at the bottom. That might be safer in the sense that I'm not directly engaging with the enemy, but it's slower.\n\nConsidering the objective: I want to collect apples and survive. The enemy is a threat. I should consider whether I can kill the enemy early or force them into a bad position. Since we both have empty bodies, there's no risk of hitting each other's bodies immediately. However, if I can eat an apple and grow, I might become a threat to the enemy if they move into my body.\n\nBut on turn 0, the safest move is probably to go for the apple at (0,2) because it's very close and low risk. But I need to consider if moving LEFT exposes me to any immediate danger. Let's check the board around (1,2): \n- (1,2) is empty.\n- (1,1) is empty (row 1: all empty).\n- (1,3) is empty? Row 3: (1,3) is empty (from row 3 string: \"3 . . . . . . . A . A\" so (1,3) is .).\n- (0,2) is apple.\n- (2,2) is my current position, but I'm leaving it.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe.\n\nNow, what about the enemy's possible moves? If I move LEFT, enemy might:\n- Move LEFT to (2,2): then after move, enemy is at (2,2), I am at (1,2). No collision.\n- Move UP to (3,3): then enemy at (3,3), me at (1,2). Safe.\n- Move DOWN to (3,1): safe.\n- Move RIGHT to (4,2): safe.\n\nSo no immediate collision risk with LEFT move.\n\nIf I move UP, enemy might move LEFT to (2,2) which I left, or UP to (3,3), etc. Still safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN, similar.\n\nNow, which move gives me the best long-term options? I think LEFT is aggressive and allows me to get an apple quickly. After eating the apple, I'll have a body segment, which might be useful later to kill the enemy if they chase me.\n\nBut there is a risk: after I eat the apple at (0,2), I will be at (0,2) with body at (1,2). From there, my possible moves are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), or RIGHT to (1,2) which is my body, so that would kill me. So I must avoid moving right. That limits my options to two directions. That might trap me if the enemy blocks those directions. However, (0,3) and (0,1) are both empty currently, and there are apples further away. So I should be able to move to one of them and then continue. But if the enemy is nearby, they might move into those cells to cause a collision or block me. For example, if after I eat the apple, the enemy moves to (0,3) on the same turn, and I also move to (0,3), that would be a head-on collision, both die. Or if enemy moves to (0,1) and I move there, collision. So I need to choose my next move carefully.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,3) instead, I keep more flexibility. From (2,3), I can go to (2,4) for an apple, or (1,3), (3,3), (2,2). All are currently empty. (2,4) has an apple, so that's a good target. (2,4) is also not on the edge, so after eating, I would have body at (2,3), and from (2,4) I can go in three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) except DOWN back into my body. That's more flexible than being on the edge.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is near the center, and there are other apples around: (0,4), (1,7), (5,7), etc.\n\nConsidering the enemy, if I go for (2,4), the enemy might try to intercept. From (3,2), to reach (2,4), enemy would need to go UP twice and LEFT once. So they can't get there in one move. So I have a head start.\n\nAlso, moving UP might keep me away from the enemy initially, reducing the chance of immediate conflict.\n\nBut moving LEFT gives me a faster apple and potential to kill the enemy if they follow me into my body later.\n\nI need to decide. Let's think about the win condition: the game lasts 150 turns, and we need 30 apples to win. That's a lot, so I need to collect apples efficiently. The apple at (0,2) is a free apple that I can get quickly, but it might lead to a vulnerable position. The apple at (2,4) is also close and safer.\n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake. If I can kill the enemy early, I win immediately if I'm the only one alive. But I can only kill the enemy if they move into my body. That requires them to be adjacent to my body and decide to move into it. On turn 0, I have no body, so I can't kill them yet. If I eat an apple on turn 1, then on turn 2, I might have a body. But the enemy might avoid my body. So killing the enemy is not guaranteed.\n\nPerhaps a safer strategy is to collect apples without engaging in risky maneuvers. Since I have no body, I can move freely, and the board has many apples. I should prioritize apples that keep me in the center or safe areas.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (0,2) is on the left edge, which might become a trap if I grow there. The apple at (2,4) is more central. Also, there is an apple at (0,4) which is also on the left edge, but further up. There is an apple at (2,6) which is central. There are apples at (5,7), (1,7), etc.\n\nI think moving UP to (2,3) is a good choice because it sets me up for the apple at (2,4) next turn, and from there I have access to many other apples. It also keeps me away from the immediate conflict with the enemy at (3,2). The enemy might move to (3,3) or (4,2), etc., but that's fine.\n\nIf I move UP, I need to consider if the enemy could move UP to (3,3) and then on the next turn, if I move to (2,4) and enemy moves to (2,4) or (3,4), there could be a collision. But that's two moves away, so I can plan accordingly.\n\nGiven that it's turn 0, and I have 150 turns to go, I should avoid unnecessary risks. Moving LEFT to (1,2) might be slightly risky because it brings me closer to the enemy's potential path? Not really, but it puts me on the edge. \n\nAlso, consider that the enemy might move to (2,2) after I leave. If I move LEFT, enemy moves to (2,2), then on next turn, I am at (1,2) and enemy at (2,2). If I move to (0,2) to eat apple, enemy might move to (1,2) and die, or might move elsewhere. If enemy moves to (1,2) and dies, that's good. But if enemy doesn't move there, I eat the apple safely. So worst case, I get the apple and have a body at (1,2). Then from (0,2), I can move UP or DOWN. The enemy might block one of those if they are nearby. But at that point, the enemy could be at (2,2) or elsewhere. If enemy is at (2,2), they could move to (1,2) but that's my body, so they die, or move to (2,3) or (2,1) or (3,2). So they might choose not to move into my body. So I should be safe.\n\nBut if I move UP, I might get the apple at (2,4) on turn 2. That apple is also valuable.\n\nComparing apples: (0,2) is worth 1 point, (2,4) is worth 1 point. Both are similar. But (2,4) is more central and offers more future options. \n\nI also need to think about the enemy's potential score. If I go for (0,2), the enemy might go for (2,4) or (4,0) etc. If I go for (2,4), the enemy might go for (0,2) or (4,0). Since the enemy is at (3,2), they are closer to (4,0) than I am. From (3,2) to (4,0) is 1 right and 2 down, so they could potentially get there in 3 moves? Actually, Manhattan distance is 3, so in 3 moves they could reach it, but I would be going for (2,4) which is also 2 moves from me? From (2,2) to (2,4) is 2 moves up. So I could get (2,4) in 2 moves if I go UP now and then UP again. Meanwhile, the enemy would take 3 moves to get to (4,0), so I might be able to get one apple before they get one. But the enemy might also go for (2,4) if I don't? From (3,2), to (2,4) is left and up, distance 3, so I have an advantage. So if I go for (2,4), I can secure it before the enemy can reach it.\n\nBut if I go for (0,2), I can get it in 2 moves (LEFT now, LEFT next turn), and the enemy cannot get it before me because they are farther. So both are safe in terms of being first to the apple.\n\nNow, which apple is more strategically placed? (2,4) is near the center, and there are other apples around it: (0,4) left, (1,7) up-left, (2,6) up, (5,7) right-up. So from (2,4), I have access to a cluster of apples. From (0,2), the nearby apples are (0,4) up, (1,7) up-right, (0,9) up, (2,6) up-right. So also many apples, but being on the edge might be limiting.\n\nAlso, from (0,2), I might have to deal with the left wall. But since the board is 10x10, the left wall is only one edge.\n\nConsidering the enemy, if I go to (2,4), I am closer to the enemy's starting position, which might lead to more interactions. If I go to (0,2), I am farther from the enemy, which might be safer.\n\nBut in snake games, often it's good to control the center. However, with an empty body, I have no restrictions, so I can change direction easily.\n\nI should also consider that if I move LEFT, I might be able to block the enemy from going to the left side later? But that's speculative.\n\nLet's think about the next few moves. If I move UP to (2,3), my body is empty. On turn 1, I could move UP to (2,4) to eat the apple. Then I grow, body at (2,3). Then on turn 2, I need to decide where to go. From (2,4), I have options: UP to (2,5) which is empty? Row 5: \"5 . . . . . . . . . A\" so (2,5) is empty. LEFT to (1,4) which is empty? Row 4: \"4 A . A . . . . . . .\" so (1,4) is empty. RIGHT to (3,4) which is empty? Row 4: (3,4) is empty. DOWN back to (2,3) which is my body, so that would kill me. So I have three safe directions. Good.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,2), then on turn 1, I move LEFT to (0,2) to eat apple. Then body at (1,2). On turn 2, from (0,2), I can move UP to (0,3) or DOWN to (0,1). Both are empty. That's only two options. So I have fewer directions. That might be a problem if the enemy is nearby and blocks one of them. For example, if the enemy is at (1,2) after turn 1? Actually, if enemy moved to (1,2) on turn 1, they would die because they moved into my body? Let's see: On turn 1, I move from (1,2) to (0,2). Enemy could move from (2,2) to (1,2). Since I left (1,2) and enemy enters (1,2), and after the move, my body includes (1,2), so enemy head is on my body, enemy dies. So if enemy is foolish, they die. If they are smart, they won't move into (1,2). So they might move elsewhere, like UP to (2,3) or DOWN to (2,1) or RIGHT to (3,2). So after turn 1, enemy could be at (2,3) or (2,1) or (3,2). Then on turn 2, I am at (0,2) with body at (1,2). If enemy is at (2,3), they could move to (1,3) or (2,4) or (3,3) or (2,2). None of those are (0,3) or (0,1) directly, so they might not block me immediately. But they could move to (1,3) and then on turn 3, if I move to (0,3), they could move to (0,3) as well, causing a collision. So there is some risk.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (3,2) and I have no body, I think moving UP is a more neutral and flexible move. It keeps me in the center and opens up more options. Also, by moving UP, I avoid the left edge where I might get trapped later. \n\nMoreover, looking at the apple list, there are many apples on the top and right side. So moving towards the center is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I will choose UP.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any immediate danger in moving UP. Is (2,3) occupied? No. Is it within board? Yes. No snake bodies. So safe.\n\nIf I move UP, the enemy might move UP to (3,3), but that's fine.\n\nI should also consider that the enemy might move LEFT to (2,2) and then on the next turn, if I move UP to (2,3), enemy could move UP to (2,3) causing head-on collision? That would be bad. But if enemy moves LEFT to (2,2) on turn 0, then on turn 1, if I move UP to (2,3), enemy could move UP to (2,3) as well. That would be a head-on collision, both die. So I need to avoid that. But is that likely? The enemy might not move to (2,2) if they see that I might move UP. But they could. However, if I move UP, and enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), then on turn 1, I am at (2,3) and enemy at (2,2). If I then move UP to (2,4), enemy could move UP to (2,3) and cause a collision? Actually, if enemy moves UP from (2,2) to (2,3), and I am at (2,3) moving to (2,4), then we are moving into different cells: I into (2,4), enemy into (2,3). No collision because we are not moving into the same cell. However, if enemy moves UP to (2,3) and I am still at (2,3) at the start of the move? No, at the start of turn 1, I am at (2,3) and enemy at (2,2). If I move UP to (2,4) and enemy moves UP to (2,3), then at the end of turn 1, I am at (2,4), enemy at (2,3). No collision. So that's safe. The head-on collision only happens if two heads move into the same cell simultaneously. Here, they move into adjacent cells. So it's fine.\n\nThe danger would be if on the same turn, I move into (2,3) and enemy moves into (2,3). That would happen if I choose UP to (2,3) and enemy chooses UP to (2,3) from (2,2). But enemy is at (3,2), not (2,2). To move into (2,3), enemy would need to be at (2,2) or (3,3) or (2,4) or (1,3). Currently enemy is at (3,2). So to move into (2,3) in one move, they would need to go UP to (3,3) and LEFT to (2,3) simultaneously, which is not possible. So enemy cannot move into (2,3) in one move from (3,2). The only way enemy could be in (2,3) on turn 1 is if they were already there at turn 0, but they are not. So moving UP to (2,3) is safe from head-on collision on turn 0.\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (1,2), enemy cannot move into (1,2) in one move from (3,2). So that's also safe from head-on collision.\n\nSo both LEFT and UP are safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\nNow, considering long-term, I think UP is better.\n\nI also need to provide a rationale for my move. The instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should include a strategy note. Since it's turn 0, I can outline my plan for the next few turns.\n\nMy plan: Move UP to (2,3) to approach the apple at (2,4) and maintain central positioning. On turn 1, move UP to (2,4) to eat the apple and grow. Then, from (2,4), explore options towards the cluster of apples on the top-right (e.g., (2,6), (5,7), (1,7)). Avoid the enemy and use my body to block or trap the enemy if possible.\n\nBut I need to be concise.\n\nNow, for the final move, I must output exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nSo I will choose UP.\n\nLet's write the response with rationale first, then the move.**Turn 0 Rationale:**\nI am at (2,2) with an empty body, and the enemy is at (3,2). Immediate risks are minimal, but I need to secure apples safely while keeping options open. Moving UP to (2,3) positions me closer to the apple at (2,4) and keeps me central, avoiding the edge where growth could trap me later. From there, I can quickly eat (2,4) on turn 1 and then access multiple apple clusters (e.g., (2,6), (5,7), (1,7)) without compromising flexibility. This move avoids direct confrontation with the enemy while setting up a strong early-game path. The enemy may move to claim nearby apples like (4,0), but I can outpace them to central apples and later use my body defensively if they engage.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\n1. Turn 0: Move UP to (2,3).\n2. Turn 1: Move UP to (2,4) to eat the apple and grow, gaining my first point.\n3. From (2,4), assess enemy position and apple availability, prioritizing apples in the central area (e.g., (2,6), (1,7)) while avoiding edges and keeping escape routes open.\n4. Stay aware of the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions and potentially lure them into my body segments later.\n\nUP",

I just moved UP from (2,3) to (2,4) and ate an apple, growing my tail. The enemy snake #0 is at (3,4), one cell to the right. Immediate threats: if the enemy moves LEFT into (2,4) on this turn, we would have a head-on collision and both die. If I move RIGHT into (3,4) and the enemy stays still or moves LEFT, I would collide with its head. I cannot move DOWN into (2,3) because that's my own body (backwards collision). Moving LEFT is safe: (1,4) is empty, off-board risk minimal. Moving UP is safe: (2,5) is empty (apple is at (2,6) but not adjacent). Moving DOWN is fatal. Moving RIGHT is risky due to enemy at (3,4).\n\nStrategy for next few turns:\n- Turn 1: Move LEFT to (1,4) to avoid the enemy and stay mobile. This keeps me from being trapped and allows access to apples at (0,2), (0,4), and central clusters.\n- From (1,4), assess enemy's move: if enemy moves UP or DOWN, I can consider moving RIGHT back toward (2,4) or staying left to avoid conflict. Prioritize staying alive and growing by heading toward (0,4) or (2,6) while keeping escape routes to the bottom and left edges.\n- Long-term: Outlast the enemy by controlling central apples (e.g., (5,7), (1,7)) and using body segments to block or lure them. Avoid edge traps and keep multiple exit paths.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "I need to analyze the current state and decide my move. Let's think step by step.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Board: 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n- My snake (ID 1):\n  - Head: (2,5)\n  - Body: [(2,4)]\n  - Apples: 1\n- Enemy snake (ID 0):\n  - Head: (3,5)\n  - Body: none\n  - Apples: 0\n- Apples at: many positions. Relevant nearby apples: (2,6) is directly above my head. (1,7) is up-left. (0,4) is left and down. (0,9) top left. (8,9) top right. (5,9) top middle. etc.\n\n**Turn Information:**\n- Turn: 3/150\n- My last move: UP from (2,4) to (2,5). I ate an apple at (2,5)? Wait, apples listed: (2,6), (1,7), (0,9), (5,9), (0,4), (8,8), (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (5,7), (0,2), (8,5). There is no apple at (2,5). But my last move rationale said I moved UP and ate an apple. There's a discrepancy. Let's check the board state provided:\n\nBoard state (text representation):\nRow 9: A . . . . A . . A .   (A at (0,9)? Wait, coordinates: The leftmost column is x=0. The board string shows positions from x=0 to x=9. Row 9 (top row) is y=9. The string \"A . . . . A . . A .\" means x=0 has A, x=5 has A, x=8 has A.\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . A .   (A at x=8, y=8)\nRow 7: . A . . . A . . . .   (A at x=1, y=7; A at x=5, y=7)\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . .   (A at x=2, y=6)\nRow 5: . . 1 0 . . . . A A   (x=2: My head? No, board shows \"1\" at x=2, y=5. But the text says my head is (2,5). Enemy \"0\" at x=3, y=5. Apples at x=8, y=5 and x=9, y=5? Wait, the string \"A A\" at the end: positions x=8 and x=9. So apples at (8,5) and (9,5). Yes, apples list includes (8,5) and (9,5). Good.)\nRow 4: A . T . . . . . . .   (A at x=0, y=4. \"T\" at x=2, y=4? That's my tail. Yes, body is [(2,4)]. So tail at (2,4).)\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . A . A   (A at x=8, y=3? Wait, string ends with \"A . A\". x=8: A, x=9: A? Actually \" . A\" might be x=8? Let's parse: \" . . . . . . . . A . A\" - characters: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:., 10:A? That's 11 characters. Probably a typo in the board string. Let's count the characters in each row string carefully.\n\nRow 9: \"A . . . . A . . A .\" -> A, ., ., ., ., A, ., ., A, . -> 10 chars. x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:., x=7:., x=8:A, x=9:.\nRow 8: \". . . . . . . .

A A\" -> ., ., 1, 0, ., ., ., ., A, A -> 10 chars. x=2:1 (my head), x=3:0 (enemy head), x=8:A, x=9:A.\nRow 4: \"A . T . . . . . . .\" -> A, ., T, ., ., ., ., ., ., . -> 10 chars. x=0:A, x=2:T (my tail).\nRow 3: \". . . . . . . . A . A\" -> ., ., ., ., ., ., ., ., A, ., A -> 11 chars? Let's recount: The string is \". . . . . . . . A . A\". That's 11 symbols if we count the spaces? Actually, the text representation likely uses spaces as separators. The string is \". . . . . . . . A . A\". If we remove spaces: \".........A.A\" which is 10 characters? Actually \".........A.A\" has 11 characters: 9 dots, 1 A, 1 dot, 1 A. That's 12? Let's count: 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:A, 10:., 11:A. That's 11. But board width is 10. There's likely a typo. Possibly the last \"A\" is at x=9 and there's an extra space. Or maybe the string is \". . . . . . . . A .\" and the final \"A\" is a mistake. Let's check the apples list: (7,3) and (9,3) are listed. So there are apples at x=7 and x=9? The list includes (7,3) and (9,3). Also (8,5) and (9,5). So (7,3) is apple. On row 3, we need an apple at x=7. The string \". . . . . . . . A . A\" might mean x=7: A, x=9: A? Let's map: positions 0-9. If the string has spaces, we need to split by spaces. Let's split row 3 string by spaces: \". . . . . . . . A . A\" -> [\".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \"A\", \".\", \"A\"] -> 11 elements. That's too many. Possibly the first character is missing? The board representation might have fixed width with single characters separated by spaces. Usually it's like \". A . . . . . . . .\" for 10 columns. Let's assume the board is correct as given and we need to interpret it. Since the apple list is provided, we can trust the apple coordinates. For move planning, I'll use the apple list and my position.\n\n**My Position:** Head (2,5), Tail (2,4).\n**Enemy Position:** Head (3,5), Body none.\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- Enemy head is at (3,5), adjacent right of my head (2,5). \n- If enemy moves LEFT this turn, it will go to (2,5), which is my current head position. Since we move simultaneously, if I move OUT of (2,5) and enemy moves INTO (2,5), there's no collision because I'm leaving. But if I stay or move into (2,5) (I can't stay), collision occurs if both heads end up in same cell. Actually, if I move UP to (2,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,5), no collision. If I move RIGHT to (3,5) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,5), no collision (different cells). If I move LEFT to (1,5) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,5), no collision. If I move DOWN to (2,4) (my tail), that's illegal (backwards into body) and I die. So only DOWN is immediately fatal due to self-collision.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n1. UP to (2,6): \n   - Is it on board? Yes, (2,6) is within 0-9.\n   - Is there an apple? Yes, apple at (2,6) listed. So I would eat it and grow.\n   - Is it occupied by any snake body? My body is at (2,4) and tail (2,4) only. Enemy body none. So empty.\n   - Potential collision: Enemy at (3,5) might move UP to (3,6), RIGHT to (4,5), LEFT to (2,5), DOWN to (3,4). None of these are (2,6) except if enemy moves UP-LEFT? No, only cardinal moves. So enemy cannot reach (2,6) in one move from (3,5). So safe from enemy head collision.\n   - However, consider if enemy moves LEFT to (2,5) and I move UP to (2,6): no collision.\n   - Consider if enemy moves UP to (3,6) and I move UP to (2,6): no collision.\n   - Consider if enemy moves UP-LEFT? Not allowed.\n   - So UP is safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n2. LEFT to (1,5):\n   - On board: yes.\n   - Apple? No apple at (1,5) listed.\n   - Occupied? Empty.\n   - Enemy collision: Enemy at (3,5) could move LEFT to (2,5) or UP/DOWN/RIGHT. None reach (1,5) in one move. So safe.\n   - However, consider future: from (1,5), I might have limited options if enemy approaches.\n\n3. RIGHT to (3,5):\n   - On board: yes.\n   - Apple? No apple at (3,5).\n   - Occupied? Currently enemy head is there! Wait, enemy head is at (3,5). If I move RIGHT to (3,5), and enemy stays still or moves elsewhere, I would be moving into the enemy's head position. According to rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" If I move to (3,5) and enemy moves somewhere else, then I am moving into a cell that currently has enemy head, but after movement, enemy head leaves. However, simultaneous movement: the new positions are calculated based on old positions. If enemy moves from (3,5) to, say, (4,5), then (3,5) becomes empty. But I am moving from (2,5) to (3,5). At the same time, enemy moves from (3,5) to (4,5). So after movement, I am at (3,5) and enemy is at (4,5). No collision. However, if enemy does NOT move (but snakes must move each turn? Actually, snakes must choose a move each turn, they can't stay. So enemy will move somewhere. But what if enemy moves LEFT to (2,5)? Then I move RIGHT to (3,5) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,5): different cells. No collision. However, there is a risk: if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,5), I move to (3,5), fine. If enemy moves UP to (3,6), I move to (3,5), fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), I move to (3,5), fine. So moving RIGHT seems safe from immediate head-on collision because enemy will leave (3,5). However, consider that (3,5) might be occupied by enemy's body after movement? Enemy has no body, so no.\n   - But there is another risk: if enemy moves LEFT to (2,5) and I move RIGHT to (3,5), we swap heads? Actually, we both move simultaneously: I go from (2,5) to (3,5); enemy goes from (3,5) to (2,5). That means we cross paths. According to typical Snake game rules, if two heads swap positions (cross each other), do they collide? The rules state: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" Here, we are moving into each other's previous cells, not the same cell. So no collision. However, some interpretations might consider that as a collision because heads pass through each other, but the rule specifically says \"move into the same cell\". So it should be safe.\n   - However, I should avoid moving into a cell that is currently occupied by another snake's head because if that snake doesn't move, we collide. But the snake must move, so it will leave. So it's relatively safe.\n   - But there is a strategic consideration: moving RIGHT brings me adjacent to the enemy head, potentially leading to a head-on collision in future turns if we both move toward each other. Also, the apple at (2,6) is above, and moving RIGHT takes me away from it.\n\n4. DOWN to (2,4):\n   - This is my tail. Moving into your own body is illegal and results in death. So DOWN is fatal. Eliminate.\n\nSo immediate safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- My goal is to outlast the enemy and collect apples. I have 1 apple, enemy has 0.\n- Apples nearby: (2,6) is directly above. (0,4) is left and down. (1,7) is up-left. (0,2) is down-left. (5,7) is far. (8,5) and (9,5) are to the right.\n- The enemy is at (3,5). If I move UP to (2,6), I eat an apple and grow. My tail will move to (2,5) (since I grow, the tail doesn't move? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment, meaning the tail stays in place for that turn? In Snake, when you eat an apple, the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail does not move forward; the new segment is added at the head. So after moving UP to (2,6) and eating the apple, my body becomes: head (2,6), then (2,5) (previous head), then (2,4) (tail). So body: [(2,5), (2,4)]. That means I'm occupying (2,5) and (2,4). (2,5) is currently my head, but after move it becomes body. \n- If I move LEFT to (1,5), no apple, so my tail moves forward to (2,5) (since I didn't eat, the snake moves forward: new head (1,5), body: [(2,5)], tail (2,4) moves to (2,5)? Actually, with no apple, the snake slides: head moves to new position, the tail moves forward one step, so the body length stays same. My current body is [(2,4)]. After moving LEFT to (1,5), my head is at (1,5), body becomes [(2,5)]? Wait, the old head (2,5) becomes the new body segment, and the old tail (2,4) is removed? Actually, in a snake of length 2 (head + one body segment), moving without eating: new head at (1,5), the body segment moves from (2,4) to (2,5)? Let's think: The snake's body is a list ordered head-to-tail. Currently: head (2,5), body [(2,4)]. When moving, we add new head, and if no apple, we remove the tail. So after moving LEFT to (1,5): new head (1,5), body becomes [(2,5)] (the previous head), tail removed? Actually, the tail (2,4) is removed, so the body list is just [(2,5)]. So the snake length remains 2 (head + one body segment). So I occupy (1,5) and (2,5).\n- If I move RIGHT to (3,5) (no apple), new head (3,5), body [(2,5)], tail removed. So I occupy (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nNow, consider enemy's possible moves. The enemy snake #0 has no body, so it's just a head. It can move in any direction. It might want to eat apples too. Nearby apples for enemy: (3,6)? No apple at (3,6). (4,5)? No apple. (2,5) is my current head, but if enemy moves LEFT to (2,5) and I move away, it might be empty. There's an apple at (2,6), (1,7), (0,4), etc. The enemy might move UP to (3,6) to get closer to (2,6) or (5,7), or LEFT toward (2,6), or RIGHT toward (4,5) etc.\n\n**Evaluating Each Move:**\n\n**Option UP to (2,6):**\n- Pros: Eat apple immediately, grow to length 3. Gain point. Head at (2,6) gives access to more apples above: (1,7), (0,9), (2,6) already eaten. Also (5,7) etc.\n- Cons: My body becomes (2,5) and (2,4). This creates a vertical line. Enemy at (3,5) is adjacent. If enemy moves LEFT to (2,5), it would collide with my body (since (2,5) becomes my body after I move). But simultaneous movement: if I move UP to (2,6), my body moves: new body segments are (2,5) and (2,4). Enemy moves from (3,5) to (2,5) if it chooses LEFT. Then after movement, enemy head at (2,5) and my body at (2,5) -> enemy collides with my body and dies (since enemy head moves into my body). That would be good for me! But wait, check rules: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So if enemy moves into (2,5) which is now my body, enemy dies. That's advantageous. However, we must also consider if enemy moves into my head? Not possible since I'm at (2,6). So UP seems safe and potentially beneficial if enemy moves into my body.\n- Risk: If enemy moves UP to (3,6) and I move UP to (2,6), no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,5), fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), fine.\n- Also, from (2,6), I might be somewhat cornered? (2,6) is not near the edge. I have options: LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6), DOWN to (2,5) (but that's my body, so illegal), UP to (2,7). So I have 3 safe directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) from (2,6). That's good.\n- Strategic: Eating an apple now increases my score and length, which is good for long-term survival and winning by apple count.\n\n**Option LEFT to (1,5):**\n- Pros: Avoids immediate proximity to enemy. Moves toward left side apples like (0,4), (0,2), (0,9). Leaves room for maneuvering.\n- Cons: No apple now. My length stays 2. From (1,5), I can move to (0,5), (1,6), (1,4), (2,5) (but (2,5) will be my body if I move LEFT? Actually after moving LEFT, my body is at (2,5). So moving back RIGHT to (2,5) would be into my own body, illegal). So from (1,5), safe moves: LEFT to (0,5), UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4). That's 3 options as well. \n- Consider enemy: If I go LEFT, enemy might follow or go elsewhere. The apple at (2,6) remains for later, but enemy might grab it if they move UP. However, enemy is at (3,5); to get to (2,6), they'd need to move UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP. In one turn, they can only move to (3,6), (4,5), (2,5), (3,4). They cannot reach (2,6) in one move. So the apple at (2,6) is safe for now.\n- But moving LEFT doesn't give immediate growth. I'm still length 2, enemy length 1. I have a slight size advantage already (I have 1 apple, they have 0, so I'm length 2 vs length 1). Actually, my length: head + body = 2 segments. Enemy: just head = 1 segment. So I'm already longer. Moving LEFT keeps me same length, enemy might eat an apple and grow to length 2, matching me.\n- If enemy eats an apple, they become length 2, and I stay length 2. That might be okay, but I want to maintain advantage.\n\n**Option RIGHT to (3,5):**\n- Pros: Moves into enemy's current position, but enemy will leave. This might confuse enemy or pressure them. Also, from (3,5), I'm closer to apples on the right side: (5,7), (8,5), (9,5), (8,8), (8,9), etc.\n- Cons: No apple now. My body becomes (2,5). From (3,5), safe moves: UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5) (but that's my body, illegal), RIGHT to (4,5). So 3 options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. However, LEFT is blocked by my own body. That might be a problem if I need to retreat. Also, I'm now adjacent to enemy's head if they move to (4,5) or (3,6) etc. Could lead to future head-on collisions.\n- Strategic: Moving RIGHT might be aggressive, but since I already have an apple and length advantage, I might want to avoid unnecessary risks. The enemy might be heading toward apples too. By moving RIGHT, I'm moving toward the central/right area where there are many apples, but also where enemy might be. Could lead to conflict.\n\n**Comparing:**\n- UP gives immediate apple and growth. It also potentially sets up a situation where enemy might collide with my body if they move LEFT. That's a win-win: either enemy avoids my body and I keep the apple, or enemy dies. \n- LEFT is safe but no growth, and I let the apple at (2,6) remain, which enemy could potentially get later if I don't.\n- RIGHT is neutral but commits me to right side, and I lose the apple at (2,6) for now.\n\nGiven that I already have a length advantage and an apple, and the board has many apples, I should prioritize securing another apple while maintaining safety. UP does that.\n\nAlso, consider that moving UP puts my head at (2,6), which is an apple. After eating, my body will be at (2,5) and (2,4). That means the cell (2,5) becomes occupied by my body. Since enemy is at (3,5), if enemy moves LEFT, it will collide with my body and die. That's a good outcome for me. If enemy doesn't move LEFT, it stays alive, but I have grown.\n\nTherefore, UP seems the best move.\n\nNow, check if there are any hidden dangers: \n- Could enemy move UP and then in subsequent turns cause a head-on collision? Possibly, but that's future consideration.\n- Is (2,6) definitely safe from other snakes? There are no other snakes. Only me and enemy.\n- Are there any traps? The board seems open.\n\nI should also consider that my tail is at (2,4). After moving UP and eating, my tail remains at (2,4) because I grew. Actually, when you eat an apple, your tail does not move forward; you gain a segment. So my body becomes: new head (2,6), then (2,5) (previous head), then (2,4) (previous tail). So tail stays at (2,4). That means the cell (2,4) remains occupied. That's fine.\n\nNow, I need to think about the enemy's likely move. The enemy has 0 apples and wants to grow. Nearby apples: (2,6) is an apple, but enemy can't reach it in one move. (1,7) is an apple; enemy could move LEFT to (2,5) then UP to (2,6)? Not in one turn. Actually, from (3,5), the apples that are one move away: (3,6) no apple, (4,5) no apple, (2,5) no apple, (3,4) no apple. So no immediate apple for enemy. So enemy might move to position itself for future apples. They might move UP to (3,6) to get closer to (2,6) or (5,7). Or LEFT to (2,5) to get closer to (2,6) and (1,7). Or RIGHT to (4,5) to go toward (5,7) and (8,5). Or DOWN to (3,4) to go toward (0,4) and (5,0). \n\nIf I move UP to (2,6), and enemy moves LEFT to (2,5), then enemy collides with my body (since (2,5) becomes my body). That's good. If enemy moves UP to (3,6), then no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,5), fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), fine.\n\nThus, UP seems safe and potentially advantageous.\n\nOne more thing: The rules say \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\" So moving UP gives me +1 apple, increasing my score to 2. That's good.\n\nNow, consider long-term: The game is 150 turns, and we need to reach 30 apples to win instantly. But we are only at turn 3, with 1 apple each (me 1, enemy 0). So we have a long way to go. I should aim to collect apples steadily while avoiding death.\n\nAnother consideration: My last move was UP, and I moved from (2,4) to (2,5). According to the last rationale, I moved UP and ate an apple at (2,5)? But there is no apple at (2,5) in the list. There is an apple at (2,6). Maybe I misread. Actually, in the last turn, my head was at (2,4) and I moved UP to (2,5). Did I eat an apple at (2,5)? The apples list does not include (2,5). But my score increased to 1. So I must have eaten an apple at (2,5). But the apples list provided for turn 3 does not have (2,5). Wait, the apples list is the current apples on the board at turn 3. That means at the start of turn 3, apples are at those positions. At turn 2, I moved and ate an apple, so that apple was removed. So the apples list now is after I ate. So at turn 2, there was an apple at (2,5) which I ate. That makes sense. So the apples list now does not include (2,5). So moving UP to (2,6) will eat another apple.\n\nThus, UP is consistent with growing.\n\n**Decision:** UP is the best move.\n\nI'll provide the rationale and then the final move.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMoving UP to (2,6) allows me to eat an apple immediately, increasing my score to 2 and growing to length 3. This maintains my lead over the enemy. From (2,6), I have three safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) to keep options open. Importantly, if the enemy moves LEFT into (2,5), they will collide with my body and die, which is favorable. Even if they don't, I've secured a point. Moving LEFT or RIGHT avoids the apple and risks the enemy taking it later. Therefore, UP is the optimal choice.\n\nNow, the final line must be exactly one word: UP.UP",

The enemy snake (#0) is at (5, 6).\n\nI need to evaluate the four possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Check for immediate death (self-collision or wall):**\n    *   **UP to (1, 8):** My body is at (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5). (1, 8) is not in the body list. It is within the board (0-9). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (1, 6):** My body is at (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5). (1, 6) is not in the body list. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (0, 7):** My body is at (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5). (0, 7) is not in the body list. It is within the board. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 7):** My body is at (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5). (2, 7) *is* in the body list. Moving into my own neck is illegal and fatal. **ILLEGAL/DEATH.**\n\n    So, LEFT, UP, and DOWN are immediately safe regarding self-collision.\n\n2.  **Check for enemy interaction and apple potential:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (5, 6), Body empty.\n    *   **Apple Locations:** (8, 9), (0, 9), (5, 9), (0, 4), (8, 8), (5, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 3), (4, 0), (5, 7), (0, 2), (8, 5), (7, 7), (3, 4).\n    *   **My current Head:** (1, 7). Adjacent apples: (0, 7) is not an apple (board state shows `.` at (0,7) in row 7). (1, 8) is empty. (1, 6) is empty. (2, 7) is occupied by my body.\n\n    *   **Analysis of LEFT to (0, 7):**\n        *   Moves to the left edge. (0, 7) is empty.\n        *   Apple at (0, 9) is reachable (2 moves away). Apple at (0, 4) is reachable (3 moves down).\n        *   Enemy head at (5, 6) is far away. Minimal collision risk this turn.\n        *   *Risk:* Moving to the edge reduces future mobility. However, it provides a \"wall\" on the left side, making defense easier.\n\n    *   **Analysis of UP to (1, 8):**\n        *   (1, 8) is empty.\n        *   Apple at (0, 9) is reachable (1 move away).\n        *   Apple at (8, 9) is far.\n        *   *Risk:* (1, 8) is near the top wall (y=9). If the enemy is aggressive, I might get trapped in the top-left corner.\n\n    *   **Analysis of DOWN to (1, 6):**\n        *   (1, 6) is empty.\n        *   Apple at (0, 4) is reachable (move down 2 more times).\n        *   *Risk:* Moves me slightly closer to the center of the board where the enemy is (5, 6).\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning & Future Safety:**\n    *   The goal is to survive and maximize score.\n    *   My body segments form a vertical wall at x=2 from y=5 to y=7. My head is at x=1.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (0, 7) utilizes the board boundary. This is a classic snake strategy. By hugging the wall, I limit the directions an enemy can approach from (cannot approach from x < 0).\n    *   From (0, 7), I can continue up to (0, 8) and (0, 9) to collect the apple at (0, 9), then likely turn right or down depending on the board state.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (1, 8), I am closer to the top wall but still in the open. If the enemy heads towards me, I might be forced down or left. Moving to the absolute corner (0,9) eventually is safer than being at (1,8) if enemies are aggressive.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (1, 6), I move away from the apple at (0, 9) and towards the center where the enemy is. This seems less optimal for early survival and apple collection.\n\n    *   *Enemy Prediction:* Enemy is at (5, 6). There is an apple at (5, 7) directly above it. The enemy will likely move UP to eat that apple. If they do, their head will be at (5, 7). This puts them slightly closer to my potential path, but I am still far enough away on the left side (distance ~4-5 tiles).\n\n    *   *Final Decision:* Moving **LEFT** to (0, 7) is the strongest move. It positions me on the edge, sets up a path to the apple at (0, 9), and minimizes immediate collision risk with the enemy who is likely focusing on the apple at (5, 7).\n\nLEFT",

(0, 4) is below. (5, 7) is an apple I cannot reach because the enemy is currently there (and if I try to collide, I die).\n\n2.  **Check Move Safety (Turn 7):**\n    *   **UP to (0, 8):** Valid (0-9). Check collisions: My body is at (1,7), (2,7), (2,6). (0,8) is not in body. Enemy is at (5,7) and (5,6). (0,8) is safe. It gets me closer to apple at (0,9).\n    *   **DOWN to (0, 6):** Valid. (0,6) is not in my body. Safe. Moves me towards apple at (0,4).\n    *   **LEFT to (-1, 7):** Invalid (off board). Would die.\n    *   **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Invalid (into my own body). Would die.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I am currently at (0, 7) on the left wall.\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (5, 7). Enemy is likely to move UP to (5, 8) to eat the apple at (5, 7)? No, the apple is at (5, 7) and the enemy is *currently* at (5, 7). Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt: \"Snake #0 - Head: (5, 7)\". There is also an apple at (5, 7) listed in the \"Apples at\" list. This means the enemy is *on* an apple? Or perhaps the apple data is slightly confused or the enemy just arrived there.\n    *   Let's look at the board rendering provided:\n        ```\n         9 A . . . . A . . A .\n         8 . . . . . . . . A .\n         7 1 T T . . 0 . A . .\n        ```\n        Row 7 shows `1` (Me), `T T` (My body), `.` `.` `0` (Enemy).\n        Wait, the rendered board shows `0` at (5,7). The list of apples shows (5, 7). Usually, an apple cannot occupy the same space as a snake. If the enemy is at (5,7) and an apple is listed at (5,7), the enemy might have just eaten it or it's a visual overlap. However, I must trust the text description. The enemy is at (5, 7).\n    *   My moves are UP or DOWN.\n    *   **If I go UP to (0, 8):** I am getting closer to the apple at (0, 9). This is a high-value target. I am hugging the wall, which is generally safer. The enemy is far away at (5, 7).\n    *   **If I go DOWN to (0, 6):** I move towards the apple at (0, 4). This is also a valid path.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Apple (0, 9) is closer to my current position (0, 7) than (0, 4) is.\n        *   (0, 9) is a corner (max X, max Y), which is excellent for survival because it limits approach angles.\n        *   Moving UP does not put me at any immediate risk. The enemy at (5, 7) is 5 units away in the X direction.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy at (5, 7). There is an apple at (5, 9) (two steps up) and (5, 0) (far down). There is an apple at (7, 3) etc. If the enemy stays in the center, they might be vulnerable to me flanking them from the wall. By moving UP, I secure the top-left corner.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Moving UP is the best option to secure the apple at (0, 9) and establish a defensive position on the top edge.\n    *   Moving DOWN is safe but less immediately rewarding and puts me more in the \"open\" area of the left side, whereas the top corner is more restrictive (in a good way).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the top-left corner by eating the apple at (0,9). Use the left and top walls as barriers to minimize the directions I need to defend against the enemy. Avoid the center until I have a size advantage or a clear shot.\n\n**Move:** UP",

This is a suicide move and results in death.\n        *   Result: Unsafe.\n    *   **LEFT to (-1, 8):**\n        *   Coordinates: Invalid (x < 0).\n        *   Result: Unsafe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n        *   Coordinates: Valid.\n        *   Collision with Self: My body is at (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7). (1, 8) is empty.\n        *   Collision with Enemy: Enemy is at (6, 7) and (5, 7). (1, 8) is safe.\n        *   Result: Safe. However, no apple is at (1, 8).\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   The move UP to (0, 9) is safe and consumes an apple. This is the immediate best move.\n    *   Consuming the apple at (0, 9) places me in the top-left corner. This is a highly defensible position (walls on two sides).\n    *   The enemy snake is at (6, 7). The closest apples to the enemy are likely in the center or right side. By securing the top-left corner, I isolate myself from the enemy and prevent them from cornering me.\n    *   I should continue to prioritize staying near walls and eating apples in my vicinity.\n\n4.  **Plan:**\n    *   Move UP to eat the apple at (0, 9).\n    *   After eating, I will be at (0, 9) with a body growing from (0, 8).\n    *   From (0, 9), my only move will be DOWN (to (0, 8) or (0, 7) depending on growth). I will need to snake down the left side to pick up the apple at (0, 4) or (0, 2).\n    *   Keep watch on the enemy's movement. They are likely to head towards the center/right side apples.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nUP is safe, eats an apple, and secures a strategic corner.\n\nUP",

Wait, actually, the provided board state shows the board at turn 10 (after my last move). The board shows 'T' at (0,9), (0,8), (0,7) which are my previous body parts (tail). The head is at (1,9) marked as '1' in the board representation (row 9, col 1). So my current head is (1,9), and my body segments are (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7). The tail is at (1,7).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,8) with body (7,7), (6,7).\n\nApples are everywhere: (8,9), (5,9), (0,4), (8,8), (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (0,2), (8,5), (3,4), (1,2), (3,0), (6,9).\n\nI need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each direction for immediate death:\n\n1.  **UP**: From (1,9) to (1,10). Y=10 is outside the board (0-9). Death.\n2.  **LEFT**: From (1,9) to (0,9). Looking at the board, (0,9) is marked 'T'. This is my own body (the tail moves away eventually, but currently it is occupied). The rules say \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" Moving into a body segment kills you. However, note that snakes move simultaneously. My tail (currently at 1,7) might move forward? Let's check my body. My current body is: (1,9) [Head], (0,9) [Body 1], (0,8) [Body 2], (0,7) [Body 3], (1,7) [Tail]. If I move LEFT to (0,9), I am moving into my second body segment. Unless that segment moves away. Does it move away? The tail moves to the position of the next segment. The next segment after tail (1,7) is (0,7). So the tail moves to (0,7). The segment (0,7) moves to (0,8). (0,8) moves to (0,9). (0,9) moves to (1,9) (my new head position if I stay). Wait, if I move LEFT to (0,9), I am stepping onto the segment that is currently at (0,9). That segment will move to (0,8) (following the body chain). So (0,9) will be empty? No, the head moves first in the logic, but collision rules usually check the destination against the *current* state or the *future* state of others. In Snake games, if you move into a cell that your body is currently occupying, you die, unless that body part is the tail and the tail moves away. Here, (0,9) is not the tail. The tail is (1,7). So (0,9) is a body segment that will move to (0,8). So (0,9) will become empty *after* the move. However, standard Snake rules say you cannot move into a body segment that is not the tail. Even if it moves, the space might be considered occupied. Actually, in most implementations, if you move into a cell currently occupied by your body (excluding the tail moving away), you die. (0,9) is currently occupied and is not the tail. So moving LEFT is likely death. Let's verify with the \"Rules and win conditions\": \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" It doesn't specify \"future\" body, it implies the state at the time of movement. Since the movement is simultaneous, checking the current state is standard. Therefore, LEFT is likely unsafe.\n\n3.  **DOWN**: From (1,9) to (1,8). Looking at the board, (1,8) is '.' (empty). My body is at (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7). (1,8) is not occupied by my body. Enemy is at (7,8) etc. (1,8) is clear. Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: From (1,9) to (2,9). Board shows (2,9) is '.' (empty). My body is at x<=1 or (1,7). (2,9) is clear. Safe.\n\nSo immediate safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's evaluate long-term safety and apple potential.\n\n**Current Position (1,9):**\n- Apples nearby: (0,2), (1,2), (3,0), (3,4), (5,0), (5,9), (8,5), (8,8), (8,9), (9,3), (9,5).\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (7,8). It has 2 apples. It is far from me.\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (2,9)**\n- This moves me to the right along the top row.\n- Board top row (y=9): T(0,9), 1(1,9), .(2,9), .(3,9), .(4,9), A(5,9), .(6,9), A(7,9 is empty? wait, board row 9: \"9 T 1 . . . A A . A .\". Indices: 0:T, 1:1, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:A.\n  - Wait, (7,9) is 'A'? No, the board string is \"9 T 1 . . . A A . A .\"\n  - Col 0: T (0,9)\n  - Col 1: 1 (1,9)\n  - Col 2: . (2,9)\n  - Col 3: . (3,9)\n  - Col 4: . (4,9)\n  - Col 5: A (5,9)\n  - Col 6: A (6,9)\n  - Col 7: . (7,9)\n  - Col 8: A (8,9)\n  - Col 9: . (9,9)\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,9), I am approaching apples at (5,9) and (6,9).\n- However, (6,9) is an apple. (5,9) is an apple.\n- The enemy snake is at (7,8). It might move UP to (7,9) or RIGHT to (8,8) or LEFT to (6,8). (7,9) is currently empty. (8,8) is an apple.\n- If I move RIGHT, I am moving towards the center. The board is open there.\n- Risk: If enemy moves UP to (7,9), it's not a collision with me. If enemy moves UP-UP to (7,9) and I go RIGHT-RIGHT to (3,9), no issue.\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (1,8)**\n- This moves me off the top wall, opening up vertical movement.\n- (1,8) is empty.\n- Apples below: (1,2) is very close vertically (just 6 steps down).\n- (3,4) is diagonally down-right.\n- (3,0) is down-left.\n- If I go DOWN, I leave the top row. The top row has apples at (5,9), (6,9), (8,9). If I go DOWN, I might lose access to them if I get blocked.\n- However, the board is 10x10. From (1,8), I can go back UP to (1,9) (which will be empty as my body moves).\n- The enemy is at (7,8). (1,8) is far away.\n- Going DOWN gives me more space to maneuver. The top row is a \"wall\" (y=9). Being on the wall restricts movement (cannot go UP). Being at (1,8) allows UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (except into my body).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **RIGHT (2,9)**: Proximity to (5,9) and (6,9). But I am on the top row. If I eat (5,9) or (6,9), I grow. Growing on the top row is dangerous because it leaves a tail behind on the row, potentially blocking my retreat. If I eat (5,9) and grow, my tail stays at (1,7). If I continue moving right, I leave a trail.\n- **DOWN (1,8)**: Opens up the map. I can access (1,2), (3,0), (3,4), etc. (1,2) is a direct vertical path.\n- The enemy snake #0 is at (7,8). It is 6 units away in X. It has 2 apples. I have 4 apples. I am ahead.\n- Strategy: I should prioritize survival and space. The top row is a dead end if I go too far right without a plan.\n- Let's look at the apple at (1,2). If I go DOWN to (1,8), I am 6 steps away (1,8->1,7...1,2). That's 6 moves. I can get there in 6 turns.\n- The apple at (3,0) is also accessible.\n- The apples at (5,9) and (6,9) are close right now, but securing the vertical space seems more valuable for long-term survival.\n- If I go RIGHT, I am on the edge. If I go DOWN, I am in the interior.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1,8), I need to ensure I don't get trapped.\n- My current body is mostly on the left wall (x=0). Moving to (1,8) positions my head just to the right of the wall. My body follows.\n- If I go DOWN to (1,8), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,7). But (1,7) is currently my tail! Wait, my tail is at (1,7). If I move DOWN to (1,8), my tail will move from (1,7) to (0,7)? No, let's trace the body.\n  - Current: Head (1,9), B1 (0,9), B2 (0,8), B3 (0,7), Tail (1,7).\n  - Move DOWN: New Head (1,8). Old Head becomes B1. Old B1 (0,9) becomes B2. Old B2 (0,8) becomes B3. Old B3 (0,7) becomes Tail. Old Tail (1,7) disappears.\n  - So new body: (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n  - The tail is now at (0,7).\n- If I then go DOWN again to (1,7): Is (1,7) occupied? The new body is (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7). (1,7) is empty. The tail is at (0,7). So (1,7) is safe.\n- So a path DOWN is viable.\n\n**Alternative - LEFT?**\n- We ruled out LEFT because (0,9) is occupied by my body. Even if the tail moves, it's risky. In strict Snake rules, you die if you hit your own body. I will stick to safe moves.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT.\n- RIGHT keeps me on the edge but closer to immediate apples (5,9), (6,9).\n- DOWN gives me access to the center and the (1,2) apple.\n\nGiven that I have 4 apples and the enemy has 2, I have a lead. I should prioritize positioning and safety over a quick apple that might trap me on the top row.\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,8). If I go DOWN to (1,8), the distance increases. If I go RIGHT to (2,9), the distance decreases slightly.\nThe enemy might be going for apples on the right side (8,9, 5,9, 6,9).\nIf I go DOWN, I can secure the left side (apples at 0,2; 1,2; 3,0; 3,4).\nThe apple at (1,2) is a very safe target.\n\nLet's consider the \"Last Rationale\" for the next turn.\nMy plan: Move DOWN to (1,8) to open up the board and head towards the apple at (1,2) or explore the center.\n\n**Board Check for DOWN (1,8):**\n- Is it empty? Yes, board row 8: \"8 T . . . . . . 0 A .\"\n  - Col 0: T (0,8) - my body\n  - Col 1: . (1,8) - Target\n  - Col 7: 0 (Enemy head)\n  - Col 8: A (Apple)\n- (1,8) is '.'. Safe.\n\n**Board Check for RIGHT (2,9):**\n- Row 9: \"9 T 1 . . . A A . A .\"\n  - Col 2: . (2,9) - Target\n- Safe.\n\n**Comparing \"Future Options\":**\n- If RIGHT to (2,9): Next moves could be RIGHT to (3,9), or DOWN to (2,8).\n- If DOWN to (1,8): Next moves could be DOWN to (1,7), LEFT to (0,8) (occupied by body, unsafe), RIGHT to (2,8), UP to (1,9) (occupied by body, unsafe initially). So DOWN to (1,8) restricts immediate UP/LEFT but allows DOWN/RIGHT.\n- Actually, if I go DOWN to (1,8), my body becomes (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n  - From (1,8):\n    - UP to (1,9): Occupied by my body (B1). Unsafe.\n    - LEFT to (0,8): Occupied by my body (B3). Unsafe.\n    - DOWN to (1,7): Empty (Tail moves to 0,7). Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (2,8): Empty? Row 8, col 2 is '.'. Safe.\n  - So I have 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT).\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,9):\n  - Body becomes (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\n  - From (2,9):\n    - UP: Off board. Unsafe.\n    - LEFT to (1,9): Occupied by body (B1). Unsafe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,8): Empty. Safe.\n  - I also have 2 safe moves (RIGHT, DOWN).\n\nBoth give 2 moves. However, moving DOWN allows me to access the interior (y < 9). Moving RIGHT keeps me on the top row (y=9). The interior has more apples and more maneuvering room. The top row is a dead end on one side.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake at (7,8). It is adjacent to apples at (8,8) and (8,9). It might move towards those. By going DOWN, I move away from the enemy and secure the left side.\n\nTargetting (1,2) seems like a good intermediate goal. It's safe and out of the way.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: Move DOWN to (1,8). From there, plan to move DOWN to (1,7) or RIGHT to (2,8) depending on the next board state. Aim to collect the apple at (1,2) safely. Avoid engaging the enemy on the right side unless necessary.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Moving directly backwards\" rule.\nMy head is at (1,9). My previous move was RIGHT (from 0,9 to 1,9).\nMoving DOWN (1,8) is not backwards (which would be LEFT to 0,9). So it's valid.\n\nLet's check if (1,8) is safe from the enemy's potential move.\nEnemy at (7,8). It can move UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7 - occupied by body), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8).\nIf enemy moves UP, it goes to (7,9). I am at (1,8). No collision.\nIf enemy moves LEFT, it goes to (6,8). No collision.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT, it goes to (8,8). No collision.\nDistance is huge. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nIs there any risk from my own growth?\nI have 4 apples. I need 26 more to win. Not growing immediately is fine.\n\nWhat about the apple at (8,5)? It's in the center.\nThe apple at (3,4) is closer to my path if I go DOWN then RIGHT.\n\nLet's verify the board drawing one more time.\nRow 8: \"8 T . . . . . . 0 A .\"\nRow 9: \"9 T 1 . . . A A . A .\"\nMy head is at (1,9). The '1' is at col 1, row 9.\nMoving DOWN to (1,8) lands on '.'.\n\nIs there any scenario where DOWN is bad?\nIf the enemy decides to rush to the left side? Unlikely, it's at (7,8).\nIf I get trapped in the left corner? I can always go RIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8) and onwards.\n\nThe move DOWN seems robust.\n\nOne detail: The board shows \"0\" at (7,8). That's the enemy head.\nApples are at (8,5), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (0,2), (8,5), (3,4), (1,2), (3,0), (6,9).\n(6,9) is an apple. If I go DOWN, I leave (6,9) for the enemy or for later.\nBut securing survival is better.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\nRationale:\nI am currently at (1,9). My available moves are DOWN and RIGHT (UP and LEFT are fatal).\nI choose DOWN to (1,8). This moves me off the top wall, opening up the interior of the board.\nMoving to the interior provides more maneuvering space and access to apples like (1,2) and (3,4), which are safer targets than the crowded top-right corner where the enemy snake #0 is active.\nBy moving DOWN, I avoid potential collisions on the top row and keep my options open for the next turn.\n\nFinal move: DOWN\n\nWait, I need to output just the word \"DOWN\" on the last line.\nI will provide the reasoning before that.\n\nLet's check the apple at (0,2) and (1,2).\nFrom (1,8), I am 6 steps away from (1,2).\nPath: (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2).\nThis path is mostly empty on the board (checked row 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2).\nRow 7: \"... T T . .\" (cols 0-2 are T, T, .) -> (1,7) is currently my tail, but will be empty when I arrive? No, if I move DOWN, my body moves.\nLet's trace the path:\nTurn 10: Move DOWN to (1,8).\nTurn 11: Move DOWN to (1,7). (Target is currently my tail, but tail moves to 0,7). Safe.\nTurn 12: Move DOWN to (1,6). (Row 6 is all dots). Safe.\nTurn 13: Move DOWN to (1,5). (Row 5 has dots at 0-4). Safe.\nTurn 14: Move DOWN to (1,4). (Row 4 has A at 0, A at 3). (1,4) is empty. Safe.\nTurn 15: Move DOWN to (1,3). (Row 3 has dots at 0-2). Safe.\nTurn 16: Move DOWN to (1,2). (Row 2 has A at 0, A at 1). (1,2) is an apple.\nThis is a clear, safe path to an apple.\n\nIf I went RIGHT to (2,9):\nI could go for (5,9).\nPath: (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (4,9) -> (5,9).\nRow 9: (3,9) is ., (4,9) is ., (5,9) is A.\nHowever, the enemy is at (7,8). It might go for (5,9) or (6,9).\nAlso, growing on the top row extends my body along the row.\nIf I eat (5,9), my tail stays at (0,7) (assuming I moved right 3 times).\nNew body: (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9).\nThis is a long horizontal line at y=9.\nIf I need to retreat, I have to go back through myself.\nThe vertical path is safer.\n\nConclusion: DOWN is the better strategic move.\n\nOne final check: The enemy snake #0 is at (7,8). Its body is (7,7), (6,7).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (7,9), it eats the apple at (8,9)? No, (8,9) is at x=8. (7,9) is empty.\nIf it moves UP, it puts pressure on the top row.\nBy going DOWN, I remove myself from that pressure zone.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (6,9). If I go DOWN, the enemy might take it.\nBut I have a lead (4 vs 2 apples). I can afford to let it have an apple or two while I secure a safer path.\n\nFinal decision is DOWN.\n\nOne tiny detail: The board shows 'T' at (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\nIf I move DOWN to (1,8), my new head is (1,8).\nMy body will be (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7).\nThe 'T's on the board represent my *current* body. They will move.\nThe board state provided is static. I must simulate the movement mentally.\nMy move is valid.\n\nRationale summary:\n- Avoid immediate death (UP/LEFT).\n- Choose DOWN over RIGHT to escape the top wall.\n- DOWN allows access to safer apples (1,2) in the interior.\n- DOWN provides more maneuvering room.\n- DOWN increases distance from the enemy snake.\n\nI will format the output with the rationale and the final word \"DOWN\".I am currently at (1, 9). My available moves are DOWN to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 9). Moving UP is off the board and moving LEFT into (0, 9) would hit my own body segment (which is not the tail), resulting in death.\n\nI choose **DOWN** to (1, 8). This move takes me off the top wall, opening up the interior of the board. Moving to the interior provides significantly more maneuvering space compared to staying on the edge. It also allows me to safely navigate towards apples like (1, 2) and (3, 4), which are located in less contested areas. By moving DOWN, I avoid the crowded top-right corner where the enemy snake (#0) is active, maintaining a safe distance and preserving my lead of 4 apples to their 2.\n\nDOWN",

A A . 0 .  (0=enemy head, T=occupied, A=apple, .=empty)\nRow 8: T T . . . . . T T .  (T=occupied)\nRow 7: . 1 . . . . T T . .  (1=my head)\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . A . . . A A  (A=apple)\nRow 4: A . . A . . . . . .  (A=apple)\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . A  (A=apple)\nRow 2: A A . . . . . . . .  (A=apple)\nRow 1: . . . . . A . . . .  (A=apple)\nRow 0: . . . A A A . . . .  (A=apple)\n\n**My possible moves from (1,7):**\n\n1. **UP to (1,8)**: This is my own body! I would die. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (1,6)**: \n   - Not off board (y=6 is valid)\n   - Not my own body (my body is at (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8))\n   - Not enemy body (enemy is at (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7))\n   - Board shows (1,6) is empty (\".\")\n   - This is a safe move!\n3. **LEFT to (0,7)**:\n   - Not off board (x=0 is valid)\n   - Not my own body (my body is at (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8))\n   - Not enemy body (enemy is at (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7))\n   - Board shows (0,7) is empty (\".\")\n   - This is a safe move!\n4. **RIGHT to (2,7)**:\n   - Not off board (x=2 is valid)\n   - Not my own body (my body is at (1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8))\n   - Not enemy body (enemy is at (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7))\n   - Board shows (2,7) is empty (\".\")\n   - This is a safe move!\n\nSo I have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n**DOWN to (1,6):**\n- Moving down gives me access to apples at (1,2) and other nearby apples.\n- (1,6) is open, (1,5) is empty, (1,4) is empty, (1,3) is empty, (1,2) has an apple!\n- This seems like a good path toward the apple at (1,2).\n- Downward direction seems relatively safe and open.\n\n**LEFT to (0,7):**\n- Would move me to (0,7), but then I'd be near my own body at (0,8) and (0,9).\n- If I go LEFT to (0,7), then my next moves: (0,6) is empty, (0,5) is empty, (0,4) has an apple.\n- However, being at (0,7) is quite constrained - I can only go DOWN or RIGHT (can't go UP into my own body, can't go LEFT off board).\n- This limits my future options.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,7):**\n- Opens up movement to the right side of the board.\n- (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), etc. are all empty.\n- This gives me more freedom of movement.\n- However, I'm moving away from nearby apples like (1,2).\n\n**Long-term strategy consideration:**\n- The enemy snake is at (8,9) and seems to be in the top-right corner.\n- I should avoid direct confrontation.\n- The apple at (1,2) is close and reachable via DOWN.\n- But being able to maneuver freely is also valuable.\n- Since I'm tied in apples (4-4), I need to be both safe and productive.\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing DOWN gives me a clear path to a nearby apple at (1,2) and keeps me in the left-middle area where there are several apples. This seems like the most productive safe move. LEFT would trap me against the wall, and RIGHT moves me away from the closest apple.\n\nLet me verify one more time: from (1,7) DOWN to (1,6) is safe because:\n- (1,6) is on the board \u2713\n- Not my body \u2713\n- Not enemy body \u2713\n- Not another snake's head (enemy head is at (8,9)) \u2713\n\nThe move is safe and positions me well for future moves.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Long-term plan:** My immediate goal is to safely collect the apple at (0,2) or (1,2). Since the enemy snake is currently on the right side of the board (x=5-8, y=7-9) and moving, I should focus on the left side where apples are clustered ((0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (4,0), etc.). I must avoid moving left into the wall at x=0 too early, as that would limit my escape routes. I will proceed downwards toward the apples at y=2 and y=0, keeping the option to go right if necessary. I need to be careful not to trap myself against my own body or the wall.\n\n**Current move analysis:**\nMy head is currently at (1,4) (after moving DOWN in turn 14). My body occupies (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). The enemy snake #0 is far away at (5,9) with body stretching to (7,7). The immediate threat is limited, but I must avoid moving into my own body or the enemy.\n\n1.  **UP to (1,5):** This cell is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following the head). Moving there is suicide. \u274c\n2.  **LEFT to (0,4):** This cell contains an apple (indicated by 'A' in the board state). It is within bounds. It is not my body (my body is at x=1). It is not enemy body (enemy is at x>=5). Moving here is safe and I will eat an apple and grow. \u2705\n3.  **RIGHT to (2,4):** On board. Not my body. Not enemy body. Board shows empty. Safe, but moves me away from the dense cluster of apples on the left. \u2705\n4.  **DOWN to (1,3):** On board. Not my body. Not enemy body. Board shows empty ('.' at (1,3)). Safe. This moves me towards the apple at (1,2) and the lower-left area. \u2705\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN, LEFT to (0,4) is the most advantageous because it immediately scores an apple (increasing my score to 5) and positions me at (0,4). From (0,4), I can move DOWN to (0,3) (safe, empty), DOWN to (0,2) (apple), or potentially jump right to (1,3) if needed (though I must avoid my own tail which will move to (1,4)). The enemy is too far away to threaten (0,4) this turn. Collecting an apple is always a priority when safe.\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

DOWN moves the head directly toward that apple, keeps three safe follow\u2011up options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), and does not bring the snake closer to any immediate collision. It also shifts the tail forward, freeing space for future movement. Therefore DOWN is the better choice.\n\nPlan: After moving DOWN to (5,8) the snake will have body segments at (5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(7,8). The next turn we can aim to move DOWN again to (5,7) to eat the adjacent apple, or explore LEFT/RIGHT to reach other apples while monitoring the opponent\u2019s head at (1,4). This positions the snake to continue gathering apples in the lower rows and maintain multiple safe options.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current game state at turn 17, my snake (ID 1) is at head (0,5) with body segments at (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). I have 5 apples. Enemy snake #0 is at head (5,7) with body segments at (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8). They have 7 apples. The board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nFrom head (0,5), possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (0,6)**: Check if within bounds: y=6 is within 0-9. Check if occupied by my own body: my body is at [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]. (0,6) is not in that list. Check if occupied by enemy snake: enemy is at x >=5, so (0,6) is not occupied by enemy body. Check if there's an apple: apples listed are (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (0,2), (8,5), (3,4), (1,2), (3,0), (4,5), (5,1), (8,2), (6,4), (0,8). (0,6) is not an apple. So this move is safe, no apple, but grows tail.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0,4)**: Within bounds. Check my body: (0,4) is the first body segment after head. Moving into your own body directly behind head is suicide (since that cell is occupied by your body and will be there when you move into it). The rules say: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So (0,4) is directly behind head (0,5) (since head was at (0,5) before moving, and body is at (0,4) directly behind). That is death. \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (-1,5)**: Outside board (x=-1). Death. \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1,5)**: Within bounds. Check my body: (1,5) is in my body list. So moving into my own body is death. \u274c\n\nThus, only safe move is UP to (0,6). Even though there's no apple there, it's the only way to stay alive. After moving to (0,6), my tail will move, so the body will become: head (0,6), then (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So body will be at (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). That's fine.\n\nLong-term strategy: I'm trailing 5 apples vs 7 apples. I need to collect apples. There's an apple at (0,2) below, but I can't go down now. Also apple at (0,8) above, but that's far. I need to navigate safely. My snake is on left side, enemy is on right side (head at (5,7)). I should avoid the enemy and try to get apples. Perhaps after moving up to (0,6), I can then go right to (1,6) but that's currently my body? Wait, after moving up, body will be at (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,6) will be my tail? Actually after moving up, the tail moves forward, so the last body segment (1,7) will disappear? Let's simulate: Currently head (0,5), body: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). If I move UP to (0,6), the new head is (0,6). The body becomes: previous head (0,5) and then the rest of the body: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So tail (1,7) is removed. So after move, body: (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,6) is now my tail. Next turn, if I move RIGHT from (0,6) to (1,6), that would be moving into my own body? (1,6) is my tail, but when I move, the tail will move away? Actually, if I move right to (1,6), at the moment of moving, (1,6) is occupied by my body (the tail). That is death because I'm moving into my own body. So I cannot move right immediately. I need to continue moving up to get away from my body. Perhaps after moving up again to (0,7), then (0,8) (apple at (0,8) is there!). There's an apple at (0,8). That's promising. From (0,6) I can go up to (0,7) (safe? Check: after moving to (0,6), body: (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,7) is empty and not in body. Enemy is far. So yes. Then from (0,7) up to (0,8) which has an apple. That would give me a point. So plan: move UP now, then UP again, then UP again to get apple at (0,8). That would be three moves, but I need to ensure I don't get trapped. Also, there's an apple at (0,2) but that's behind me, hard to reach without hitting my own body.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,7) with body extending up to (5,9) and right to (8,9) etc. They might be heading toward apples on right side. They have 7 apples, I have 5. I need to catch up. Apples available: (0,8) is good. Also (0,2) but that's down. Also (1,2) but that's near my body? (1,2) is an apple, but my body might be in the way. (3,0) is an apple but far. I should focus on safe apples.\n\nCheck if any other apples reachable: (1,2) is at (1,2). From my current head (0,5), I could go down to (0,4) but that's death. So I cannot go down. So I need to go up and then maybe right.\n\nAfter moving UP to (0,6), my body will be at (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). From (0,6), I can go up to (0,7) or right to (1,6) but (1,6) is my tail (occupied) so death. Left is out of bounds. So only up is safe. So next move will also be UP.\n\nFrom (0,7), body: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Then I can go up to (0,8) (apple), right to (1,7) (maybe empty? Let's see: (1,7) is not in my body now; after moving to (0,7), body: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,7) is empty. But (1,7) is adjacent to enemy body? Enemy body has (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), etc. Not near. So (1,7) is safe. But also apple at (0,8) is better because it's an apple. So from (0,7), moving UP to (0,8) is safe and gets apple.\n\nBut need to consider enemy moves. Enemy is at (5,7). They might move up to (5,8) or down to (5,6) or left/right. Their body is at (5,8), (5,9), etc. They might be heading toward apples like (9,5) or (8,5) etc. They are not near me. So I'm relatively safe on left side.\n\nAlso, need to consider that apples are limited and turn 17 of 150. I need to collect apples efficiently. The apple at (0,8) is good. After eating that, my length increases, which might make navigation harder. But we'll deal with that later.\n\nNow, what about the apple at (0,2)? It's below, but to reach it I'd need to go down through my body? From (0,5), I can't go down. After moving up, I might be able to loop around? Possibly, but it's risky. Better to get the apple at (0,8) first.\n\nAlso, there's apple at (1,2). That's at (1,2). From (0,5) after moving up, I could eventually go right and down, but my body might block. Let's think long-term: My current body occupies x=0 and x=1 from y=4 to y=7. So the area to the right (x=1, y=0-3) might be free. Actually, (1,2) is an apple. But to get there from (0,6) or (0,7), I'd need to go right and then down. For example, from (0,7) go right to (1,7), then down to (1,6), but (1,6) might be occupied? After moving up, my body will include (1,6) as tail? Let's simulate carefully.\n\nCurrent state: Head (0,5), body: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). That's 6 segments including head? Actually head + 5 body = length 6. Apples collected 5, so length should be 6 (since each apple adds length). Yes.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,6), new head (0,6), body: previous head (0,5) and the rest: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So body: (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So (1,6) is now the last body segment (tail). (1,7) is gone.\n\nNow from (0,6), possible safe moves: UP to (0,7) (since (0,7) is empty and not in body), DOWN to (0,5) (occupied by my body, death), LEFT out, RIGHT to (1,6) (occupied by my body, death). So only UP.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,7), new head (0,7), body: previous head (0,6) and the rest: (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So body: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Tail is (1,5). Now from (0,7), possible moves: UP to (0,8) (apple, and not in body), DOWN to (0,6) (occupied by body, death), LEFT out, RIGHT to (1,7) (not in body, empty? (1,7) is not listed in body, and no apple there). So two safe moves: UP to get apple, or RIGHT to (1,7). Which is better? Getting apple gives me a point and lengthens my snake, which might make turning harder. But I need points. Also, if I go RIGHT to (1,7), I might be able to go down to (1,6) later, but (1,6) will be empty? After moving to (0,7), body does not include (1,6) because tail moved? Let's see: after moving to (0,7), body is (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,6) is empty. So from (1,7), I could go DOWN to (1,6) which is safe. Then from (1,6), I could go DOWN to (1,5) but (1,5) is occupied by my body? Actually after being at (1,6), body will be (0,7) head, then (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4). So (1,5) is not in body? Wait, careful: If I'm at (1,7) as head, body would be previous head (0,7) and then (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4). So body includes (1,4) but not (1,5). So (1,5) is empty. So I could go down to (1,5). But (1,5) is an apple? No, apples: (1,2) is an apple, (1,5) is not an apple. So that doesn't give points. Alternatively, from (1,6) I could go DOWN to (1,5) (safe) or LEFT to (0,6) but (0,6) is occupied by body? After moving to (1,7), body includes (0,6). So (0,6) is occupied, so LEFT is death. So from (1,6), DOWN to (1,5) is safe. Then from (1,5), I could go DOWN to (1,4) but (1,4) is occupied by body, death. So I'm stuck going right along row 1? Actually from (1,5) I could go RIGHT to (2,5) if safe. That might lead to more apples.\n\nBut the apple at (0,8) is immediate and safe. So I think going UP to (0,8) is better.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (0,8). So I'll go UP now, then UP again, then UP again to eat apple at (0,8). That's three moves, but I need to consider enemy moves each turn. Enemy might move up or down. They are at (5,7). They could move up to (5,8) which is currently occupied by their own body? Their body includes (5,8) as the first segment? Actually their body list: head (5,7), body: (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8). So (5,8) is directly behind their head (since head is at (5,7), and body segment at (5,8) is behind? Actually coordinates: y increases upward. So from (5,7), moving UP goes to (5,8). But (5,8) is occupied by their own body. So if they move UP, they would die (moving into own body). That's interesting. So enemy snake might be forced to move in a direction that doesn't kill them. They could move DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7), or maybe other directions? They can't move UP because it's their own body. So they likely will move down or sideways. That might bring them closer to my side? Possibly. But they are far right now.\n\nSo I'll continue with UP.\n\nNow, I need to output my move for this turn. I'll go UP.\n\nBut before finalizing, check if any other move might be viable? What about moving RIGHT? (1,5) is my body, death. LEFT out of bounds. DOWN death. So only UP.\n\nThus, my move is UP.\n\nNow, I should include a short long-term plan for the next turn. Since this is turn 17, I'll write a plan for the next few turns.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (0,6), then UP to (0,7) to prepare for eating apple at (0,8). Avoid enemy. Try to collect more apples on left side.\n\nBut I need to output only the move. So final line: UP.\n\nI'll write a short rationale before that.UP",

          "rationale": "**Reasoning:**\n\nCurrent state at turn 19:\n- My snake (ID 1) at (0,7) with body segments: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Score: 5 apples.\n- Enemy snake #0 at (4,6) with body: (4,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). Score: 7 apples.\n- Apples are scattered. Notable ones nearby: (4,0), (5,0), (3,0), (1,2), (0,2), (0,8), (3,4), (4,5), (5,1), (8,2), (8,5), etc.\n- Board is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\n**Safety assessment for each move:**\n- My current head: (0,7). My body covers: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Enemy body covers: (4,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9).\n- Moving from (0,7):\n  1. **UP** to (0,8): Check board: (0,8) shows 'A' (apple). Is it blocked? (0,8) is not in my body (my body y's are 6,5,4,4,5). Not in enemy body. Off-board? x=0,y=8 is within 0-9. So UP is safe (apple). However, consider enemy movement: enemy snake #0 head at (4,6) could move UP to (4,7) which is currently occupied by its own body (tail is (8,9), head is (4,6); moving UP to (4,7) is into its own body -> it would die if it does that, but we can't control it. Also enemy could move DOWN to (4,5) (empty), LEFT to (3,6) (empty), RIGHT to (5,6) (empty). So UP is safe for me this turn.\n  2. **DOWN** to (0,6): That's my own body segment -> immediate death. Not safe.\n  3. **LEFT** to (-1,7): Off board (x=-1) -> death. Not safe.\n  4. **RIGHT** to (1,7): Check board: (1,7) shows '.' (empty). Not my body (my body at (1,4) and (1,5) but not (1,7)). Not enemy body. Safe.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n- Moving UP (0,8) gets an apple immediately (score to 6). Also moves me to a less crowded area (top left corner). However, after eating at (0,8), my tail will grow, but currently my tail is at (1,5). After moving UP, new head (0,8), new body: (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So I will have a longer body.\n- Moving RIGHT (1,7) goes to an empty cell. No apple immediate gain, but opens up paths to other apples: from (1,7) I could go to (2,7), (1,8), (0,7) backwards? Actually from (1,7) I could go LEFT to (0,7) which is my previous head but will be part of body after move? After moving RIGHT, new head (1,7), body: (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (0,7) becomes part of body. Going LEFT from (1,7) next turn would go back to (0,7) which is now body -> death. So LEFT would be dangerous next turn if I need to retreat. But RIGHT gives access to apples at (2,7?) Actually (2,7) is empty; (1,8) is empty; (1,6) is empty? (1,6) is empty (board shows '.' at (1,6) from board: row 6 is T? Wait board row 6: index 6 row is \"T . . . 0 . . . . .\" meaning (0,6) is T? Actually board representation: row 9 is top, row 0 bottom. Row 6 (y=6): \"T . . . 0 . . . . .\" So (0,6) is T? T stands for tail? But my body includes (0,6). So board shows T for tail, which matches. (1,6) is '.' empty. So from (1,7) I could go DOWN to (1,6) empty. But I need to think about future apple collection and not getting trapped.\n\n- Long-term plan: I have 5 apples, enemy has 7. I need to catch up. There are many apples scattered. I should aim to collect apples efficiently while staying safe and avoiding collisions with enemy. The enemy is at (4,6) with a long body extending to the top right. Enemy is relatively far from me (distance ~4-5). The board has many apples in the bottom left (near (0,0), (1,2), (0,2), (3,0), etc.) and also near (4,5), (5,0), (5,1). My snake is at left edge. Moving RIGHT would go inward, but also might approach enemy's body? Not immediately.\n\n- Potential risk: enemy might move towards me? Unlikely given its body is mostly on right side. It could move DOWN to (4,5) (apple there? board shows (4,5) is A? Actually row 5: \"T T . . A . . . A A\" so (4,5) is A? Wait row index 5: y=5. (4,5) is the 5th coordinate (0,1,2,3,4,5). The row string: \"T T . . A . . . A A\" means: (0,5)=T, (1,5)=T, (2,5)=., (3,5)=., (4,5)=A, (5,5)=., (6,5)=., (7,5)=., (8,5)=A, (9,5)=A. So (4,5) is apple. Enemy at (4,6) could move DOWN to (4,5) to eat apple. That would put enemy head at (4,5) which is apple and safe (not my body). That could be possible.\n\n- If I move UP to (0,8), I get an apple. Then next turn I am at (0,8). From there, my options: UP to (0,9) (empty? board row9: \"9 . . . . . T T T T .\" so (0,9) is '.' empty). LEFT off-board, DOWN to (0,7) which is my body after move? After moving UP, my body will include (0,7) as first body segment. So DOWN would be into my own body -> death. RIGHT to (1,8) empty. So from (0,8) I have only UP and RIGHT as safe moves. That might limit options. Also, (0,9) is a corner; from there I could only go DOWN or RIGHT. Might get trapped if enemy blocks. However, (0,9) is currently empty, but enemy body includes (8,9) etc. So maybe not immediately trapped.\n\n- If I move RIGHT to (1,7), I don't get an apple immediately, but I position myself to possibly go to (2,7) or (1,8) or (1,6). From (1,7), I can access apples at (2,7)?? Actually (2,7) is empty; (1,8) empty; (0,7) is body. There's an apple at (0,2), (1,2), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (3,4), (4,5), etc. So moving RIGHT might allow me to go downwards towards those bottom-left apples. But note: (1,7) to (1,6) is empty, (1,5) is my tail (after move, tail will shift? Actually after moving RIGHT, my body will be: new head (1,7), old head (0,7) becomes body, then (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,5) is still part of body (tail). So (1,6) is empty, (1,6) could be moved into. That would bring me down towards bottom.\n\n- Considering apple collection: I need to eat 25 more apples to reach 30, but enemy needs 23 more. Since enemy has a lead, I need to prioritize apple gathering while staying alive. There are many apples in the bottom left area, and I'm already on the left edge. Moving RIGHT might be a step towards the center but also away from some bottom-left apples? Actually from (0,7) moving RIGHT to (1,7) goes right, not down. To get to bottom-left apples like (0,0), (1,2), etc., I need to go down. From (0,7), moving DOWN is impossible (into self). So the only way down is to first move RIGHT, then DOWN, etc. So moving RIGHT is a necessary step to eventually descend.\n\n- However, moving UP gives immediate apple and also moves to top left. From top left, I could later go RIGHT to (1,8), (2,8), then DOWN, etc. That might also allow access to apples on top rows like (8,5), (9,3), etc., but those are far right. But maybe there are apples on top rows: row 9 has apples? Row 9: \"9 . . . . . T T T T .\" no apples. Row 8: \"8 A . . . . T . . . .\" so (0,8) is A (that's the apple I'd eat), (1,8) is '.'; row 7: \"7 1 . . . T T . . . .\" so (0,7) is head; row 6: \"6 T . . . 0 . . . . .\" etc.\n\n- Enemy movement prediction: Enemy at (4,6) with body to the right. It might move to eat an apple. Possible moves: DOWN to (4,5) apple, LEFT to (3,6) empty, RIGHT to (5,6) empty, UP to (4,7) which is its own body (tail? actually (4,7) is its own body segment, so moving UP would kill it). So likely enemy will not move UP because it's suicide. So enemy probably moves DOWN to (4,5) to eat apple, or LEFT/RIGHT. If enemy moves DOWN to (4,5), its head will be at (4,5), which is currently empty in my view? Actually (4,5) is apple, but after eating, it will be occupied. That's fine; not near me.\n\n- Collision risk: Could enemy head move into my path? My path: if I move UP to (0,8), enemy head at (4,5) is far. If I move RIGHT to (1,7), enemy head at (4,5) still far. So immediate collision unlikely.\n\n- Future trapping: If I move UP to (0,8), my body will be long at left edge, potentially trapping myself if I need to turn around. However, from (0,8), I have two safe exits: UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8). That's acceptable. If I move RIGHT to (1,7), I have more directions: from (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6), RIGHT to (2,7). That's three options, which is better for keeping future moves open.\n\n- Also consider that after moving UP, my tail will be at (1,5) (since my body length is 6, after eating apple, length becomes 7, tail stays at (1,5) until I move again). That leaves space behind me. From (0,8), if I later go DOWN, I'd hit my own body. So I must avoid going down from (0,8). That's okay.\n\n- Long-term plan: I should aim to collect apples in clusters. There's a cluster near (0,2), (1,2), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1). That's bottom left. To get there, I need to go down. From (0,7), going DOWN is impossible now. So I must first move RIGHT to start descending. However, moving RIGHT also allows me to go DOWN to (1,6) next turn. So RIGHT seems more flexible for descending to bottom-left cluster.\n\n- But moving UP gives immediate point, which closes the gap slightly (5 to 6 vs enemy 7). However, points matter only at the end; staying alive and maximizing future apples is key. Given enemy has 7 apples, I need to catch up, but one apple now might be worth it if it doesn't hinder future collection. Let's evaluate safety and flexibility more.\n\n- Let's simulate both moves briefly:\n  Option A: UP to (0,8). New head (0,8) with apple. Body: (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Next turn, safe moves from (0,8): UP to (0,9), RIGHT to (1,8). That's two options. (0,9) is corner; from there, safe moves: DOWN to (0,8) which will be body, LEFT off-board, RIGHT to (1,9). So (1,9) is empty? Row 9: (1,9) is '.' (since row 9: \"9 . . . . . T T T T .\" meaning (0,9)='.', (1,9)='.', etc). So from (0,9), only RIGHT is safe. That's very restrictive. If I later need to escape, I might be trapped. Also, from (1,8), safe moves: UP to (1,9), DOWN to (1,7) which will be body? After moving to (1,8), body will be (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,7) is empty? Actually (1,7) is empty (board row 7: (1,7) is '.'). So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (0,8) which is body (head from previous turn). So LEFT is death. RIGHT to (2,8) empty. So from (1,8), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. That's good. So if I go UP now, next turn I could go RIGHT to (1,8) which is fine. But going to (0,9) is risky. So I should avoid going to (0,9) and instead go RIGHT to (1,8). That seems okay.\n\n  Option B: RIGHT to (1,7). No apple. Body: (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). Next turn from (1,7), safe moves: UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6), RIGHT to (2,7). Also LEFT to (0,7) which is body (death). So three options, all decent. From (1,8) I can go to (2,8) etc. From (1,6) I can go down further towards bottom. This gives more flexibility to descend to apple cluster.\n\n- Considering the apple cluster: (1,2) and (0,2) are near bottom left. To get there, I need to go down. From (1,7), I can go DOWN to (1,6), then DOWN to (1,5) which is my tail? Actually after moving RIGHT, my tail is at (1,5) (since body length 6). If I go DOWN to (1,6) next turn, then tail will move forward, so (1,5) will become empty. Then from (1,6) I can go DOWN to (1,5) which is now empty? Wait careful: After moving RIGHT to (1,7), my body is: head (1,7), then (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So tail is at (1,5). Next turn, if I move DOWN to (1,6), new head (1,6), body: (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4). Tail becomes (1,4). So (1,5) is no longer occupied. So I could later go to (1,5) or further down. That seems good.\n\n- Also, there is an apple at (0,2). From (1,7), I could go DOWN to (1,6), then LEFT to (0,6)? But (0,6) is currently my body? After moving to (1,6), my body will include (0,6) as part of body? Let's see: After moving RIGHT then DOWN, body segments: (1,6), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4). So (0,6) is indeed part of body. So I cannot go LEFT to (0,6) because it's my body. However, I could go DOWN to (1,5) (empty), then LEFT to (0,5) which is also body? (0,5) is body. So I need to be careful. To reach (0,2), I might need to go around. But maybe better to aim for (1,2) directly from (1,6) by going DOWN repeatedly: (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2). Check if any of those are occupied: (1,5) after my move will be empty? Actually after moving DOWN from (1,7) to (1,6), my body includes (1,5) as tail? Wait earlier we said tail becomes (1,4). So (1,5) is empty. (1,4) is part of body? Actually (1,4) is body segment (from original). After moving DOWN, body includes (1,4) as the second-to-last? Let's compute precisely: Starting after RIGHT move: body = [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5)] with head (1,7). After moving DOWN to (1,6): new head (1,6). New body = [(1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)]. So (1,5) is gone (since tail was (1,5) and it moves forward, leaving (1,5) empty). (1,4) is still occupied (now second-to-last). So from (1,6), moving DOWN to (1,5) is safe (empty). Then from (1,5), moving DOWN to (1,4) would be into my own body (since (1,4) is part of body). So I cannot go directly down to (1,4). That's a problem: the path down from (1,6) to (1,2) is blocked by my own body at (1,4). I would need to go around via left or right. For example, from (1,5) I could go LEFT to (0,5) but (0,5) is body (since (0,5) is in body list). So that's also blocked. So I might be trapped if I go down that column. Actually, looking at my body after moving RIGHT: I have a vertical segment on column 0 from y=4 to y=7, and a horizontal segment at (1,4) and (1,5). So my body forms an \"L\" shape. From (1,6), I can go DOWN to (1,5) (safe), but from (1,5), the only safe moves might be UP back to (1,6), RIGHT to (2,5), or DOWN to (1,4) (death), LEFT to (0,5) (death). So (1,5) is a dead-end if I go there. However, I could from (1,6) go RIGHT to (2,6) instead, then DOWN, etc. That might be better.\n\n- If I go UP to (0,8), my body is vertical on column 0 from y=4 to y=8, and a bit at (1,4) and (1,5). From (0,8), I can go RIGHT to (1,8), then from (1,8) I have options. That might allow more flexibility to go right then down.\n\n- Considering the long-term plan: I need to collect many apples. The bottom-left cluster is attractive but my body currently blocks direct descent. I might need to move right first to clear the column 0 blockage. Actually, if I move RIGHT twice (first to (1,7), then to (2,7)), my body will shift and eventually the vertical segment on column 0 will move out, freeing up column 0 for future movement. That could allow me to later go down column 0 to (0,2) etc. So moving RIGHT now seems strategic.\n\n- Also, note that there is an apple at (5,1) and (5,0) and (4,0) etc. Those are further right. Moving RIGHT brings me closer to them.\n\n- Enemy's potential threat: Enemy is at (4,6). If I move RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, possibly closer to enemy. However, enemy's body extends to the right top, so its reach is limited. If enemy moves DOWN to (4,5), that's still far from me. If enemy moves LEFT to (3,6), that's closer but still 2 cells away from (1,7). Not immediate collision.\n\n- Considering turn count: 19 out of 150. Plenty of time. I should prioritize establishing a good position for future apple collection, not just immediate point.\n\n- Decision: I'll move RIGHT. This gives me three safe follow-up options, allows descending to apple clusters, and avoids potential trapping at top-left corner. I sacrifice immediate apple but set up for more apples later.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move RIGHT to (1,7) to start descending towards bottom-left apple cluster while keeping options open. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body. Aim to collect apples at (1,2), (0,2), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1) in the next few turns. Be wary of enemy movements; keep distance from snake #0's body.\n\nNow, final move line: RIGHT.RIGHT",

          "rationale": "Current state (turn 20): My snake (ID 1) head is at (1, 7). Body segments: [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)]. Apples collected: 5. Enemy snake #0 head at (4, 5). Its body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. Enemy apples: 8.\n\nApples: (5, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 3), (4, 0), (0, 2), (8, 5), (3, 4), (1, 2), (3, 0), (5, 1), (8, 2), (6, 4), (0, 8), (1, 3). Note: (0, 8) is an apple. (1, 7) is my head, not an apple.\n\nAssess moves from (1, 7):\n- UP: to (1, 8). Check board: (1, 8) is '.' (empty). Not my body (my body y's: 7,6,5,4,4; x: 0,0,0,0,1). So (1,8) is safe. Not enemy body (enemy body: (4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(5,8),(5,9),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9)). (1,8) is far. On board within 0-9. So UP is safe. No immediate apple.\n- DOWN: to (1, 6). Check: (1, 6) is '.' (empty). Not my body (my body includes (0,6) and (0,5), (0,4), (1,4) but not (1,6)). Safe. Not enemy body. DOWN is safe.\n- LEFT: to (0, 7). (0, 7) is my body segment (the first body segment after head? Actually my body list: (0,7) is the first element after head? Wait my body: [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)]. So (0,7) is my body. Moving LEFT would be into my own body -> death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: to (2, 7). (2, 7) is '.' (empty). Not my body. Not enemy body. On board. Safe.\n\nThus safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate each:\n\n1. UP to (1,8): Opens up to (0,8) left? Actually (0,8) is apple. But (0,8) is adjacent to (1,8) left? (1,8) left is (0,8). So from (1,8), I could move LEFT to (0,8) to eat apple next turn. However, (0,8) is currently occupied by an apple. After moving UP to (1,8), my body will shift: new head (1,8), body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)]. The apple at (0,8) remains. So next turn I could go LEFT to (0,8) and eat. That's good. From (1,8), other options: RIGHT to (2,8) (empty), UP to (1,9) (empty). So three safe moves. However, note that after moving UP, my body will occupy (1,7) and (0,7) etc. The apple at (0,8) is adjacent and safe. So this seems a good move: gain apple next turn while keeping options.\n\n2. DOWN to (1,6): This moves towards bottom-left apple cluster. (1,6) is empty. Next turn from (1,6), options: UP back to (1,7) (which will be body), DOWN to (1,5) (empty), LEFT to (0,6) (which is my body? After moving DOWN, body: new head (1,6), body: [(1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)]. So (0,6) is part of body. LEFT would be into (0,6) -> death. So LEFT unsafe. RIGHT to (2,6) (empty). So only two safe moves: UP (into body) and DOWN and RIGHT? Wait UP to (1,7) is now body, so unsafe. DOWN to (1,5) safe, RIGHT to (2,6) safe. So two options. That's less flexible. Also moving DOWN puts me further from the apple at (0,8) and (1,8). Might be okay but fewer options.\n\n3. RIGHT to (2,7): Moves towards center. Next turn from (2,7), options: UP to (2,8) (empty), DOWN to (2,6) (empty), LEFT to (1,7) (which will be body after move), RIGHT to (3,7) (empty). So three safe moves. However, moving RIGHT also brings me closer to enemy snake's body? (2,7) is still far from enemy (enemy at (4,5) etc). Not immediate threat.\n\nNow compare UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT:\n- UP gives immediate access to apple at (0,8) next turn (if I move LEFT). That's a guaranteed apple in two turns (turn 21: move UP to (1,8), turn 22: move LEFT to (0,8)). That would increase score to 6. Good.\n- DOWN moves toward bottom-left apples but loses apple (0,8) opportunity (since from (1,6) you can't reach (0,8) quickly). Might need to loop around.\n- RIGHT also moves away from (0,8). (0,8) apple is north-west of current position. Moving RIGHT or DOWN moves away.\n\nGiven enemy has 8 apples vs my 5, I need to close the gap. Securing an apple soon is valuable. The apple at (0,8) is adjacent and safe. So I should prioritize eating it. The plan: move UP now to (1,8), then next turn move LEFT to (0,8) to eat apple.\n\nCheck safety of that two-turn plan:\n- Turn 20: Move UP to (1,8). My body becomes: [(1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)] (length 7). Apple at (0,8) remains.\n- Enemy snake #0 head at (4,5). They will move simultaneously. What might they do? Possibly eat apple at (4,5) (which is currently apple). If they move DOWN to (4,5), they'll eat apple and grow. Their new head (4,5), body includes old head (4,5)? Wait they were at (4,5) as head? No, enemy head is at (4,5) after their move? Actually current enemy head is (4,5) (as given). Wait the state says \"Enemy snake #0 - Head: (4, 5)\". Yes, head is at (4,5). So they are already on an apple? The apple list includes (4,5)? Actually apples list includes (4,0), (5,0), etc. (4,5) is not listed as apple? Wait check apples list: (5, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 3), (4, 0), (0, 2), (8, 5), (3, 4), (1, 2), (3, 0), (5, 1), (8, 2), (6, 4), (0, 8), (1, 3). No (4,5). But board shows (4,5) as 'A'? In board representation row 5: \"T T . . A . . . A A\". That indicates (4,5) is 'A' (apple). However, the apple list does not include (4,5). Possibly the apple list is incomplete? The problem statement says \"Apples at: ...\" lists those coordinates. But board shows additional 'A's? Actually the board shows 'A's at many positions, but the list is the definitive set of apples. The board might show 'A' for apple and 'T' for tail, but the apple list is the set. So (4,5) is not an apple according to the list. The board might be showing 'A' as placeholder? Wait row 5: \"T T . . A . . . A A\". (0,5) = T, (1,5)=T, (2,5)=., (3,5)=., (4,5)=A, (5,5)=., (6,5)=., (7,5)=., (8,5)=A, (9,5)=A. So (4,5) is 'A', but it's not in the apple list. This could be a discrepancy. Perhaps the board includes apples not listed? The problem says \"Apples at: ...\" and then shows the board. The board includes 'A's, which likely are apples. So maybe the list is just a subset? Actually the list includes (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (0,2), (8,5), (3,4), (1,2), (3,0), (5,1), (8,2), (6,4), (0,8), (1,3). That's 15 apples. The board shows many more 'A's. So likely the list is the actual apples, and the board 'A' includes those and possibly other items? Wait the board key: '.' empty, '1' my head, '0' enemy head, 'T' snake tail, 'A' apple. So all 'A's are apples. So there are many apples not listed? That seems odd. Possibly the list is outdated? But the problem statement says \"Apples at: ...\" and then the board. Usually the board includes the apples. So the board is the authoritative source. The list might be a summary. The board shows 'A's at many coordinates: from board:\nRow 9: no A.\nRow 8: (0,8) is A.\nRow 7: none? Row 7: \"7 1 . . . T T . . . .\" (1 at (0,7) my head, T at (1,7)? Actually (1,7) is 'T'? Wait row 7 string: \"7 1 . . . T T . . . .\" So positions: (0,7)= '1' (my head), (1,7)='.', (2,7)='.', (3,7)='.', (4,7)='T', (5,7)='T', (6,7)='.', (7,7)='.', (8,7)='.', (9,7)='.' So no apple.\nRow 6: \"6 T . . . 0 . . . . .\" No apple.\nRow 5: \"5 T T . . A . . . A A\" So (4,5)=A, (8,5)=A, (9,5)=A.\nRow 4: \"4 T T . A . . A . . .\" So (3,4)=A, (6,4)=A? Wait (6,4) is A? Actually row 4: \"T T . A . . A . . .\" means (3,4)=A, (6,4)=A? Let's count: (0,4)=T, (1,4)=T, (2,4)=., (3,4)=A, (4,4)=., (5,4)=., (6,4)=A, (7,4)=., (8,4)=., (9,4)=. So yes (6,4)=A.\nRow 3: \"3 . A . . . . . A . A\" So (1,3)=A, (7,3)=A, (9,3)=A.\nRow 2: \"2 A A . . . . . . A .\" So (0,2)=A, (1,2)=A, (8,2)=A.\nRow 1: \"1 . . . . . A . . . .\" So (5,1)=A.\nRow 0: \"0 . . . A A A . . . .\" So (3,0)=A, (4,0)=A, (5,0)=A.\nThus apples are at: (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (3,4), (6,4), (4,5), (7,3), (8,2), (8,5), (9,3), (9,5). That's 15 apples, matches the list? Actually list includes (0,8) which is also an apple (row 8 has (0,8)=A). Wait row 8: \"8 A . . . . T . . . .\" So (0,8)=A. So total apples are 16? Let's count: list: (5,0), (9,3), (9,5), (7,3), (4,0), (0,2), (8,5), (3,4), (1,2), (3,0), (5,1), (8,2), (6,4), (0,8), (1,3). That's 15. The board also shows (4,5) and (6,4) etc. (6,4) is in list. (4,5) is not in list. So either the list is missing (4,5) or (4,5) is not actually an apple? But board shows A. Possibly the list is the apples that exist, and the board might have A for other reasons? Usually in these puzzles, the board includes apples marked as A. So likely there is an apple at (4,5). The list might be incomplete. But we can trust the board. So (4,5) is an apple. Enemy head at (4,5) means enemy is on an apple. That means enemy will eat it this turn? But the enemy's head is already on (4,5) at the start of turn 20? The state says \"Enemy snake #0 - Head: (4,5)\". So they are on the apple. That means they may have already eaten it? Actually they eat when they move onto an apple. If they are already on it at the start of a turn, does that count as eating? Typically, apples are eaten when a snake's head moves onto the apple. If the head is already on an apple from previous move, it would have already eaten it. But the apple might still be there if they haven't moved? In Snake, when you move onto an apple, you eat it and it disappears, and you grow. The apple list updates. Since the apple is still listed as present (by board), maybe the enemy hasn't moved yet this turn, and the apple is still there. But the enemy's head is at (4,5) at the start of the turn. That suggests that on the previous turn, the enemy moved onto (4,5) and ate the apple? That would increase their length and score. But the score shows they have 8 apples. Could be they ate (4,5) earlier. However, the board still shows A at (4,5) which might be an error or maybe the apple is still there. This is ambiguous. However, for safety, I should assume that (4,5) is an apple that the enemy might eat this turn if they move? Actually they are already on it; they cannot move onto it again. They will move somewhere else. So (4,5) will likely remain an apple after this turn (since they are moving away). That could be an apple for me later, but far.\n\nGiven this, I'll ignore (4,5) as immediate target.\n\nNow, back to my move: UP to (1,8). This seems good because:\n- Safe move.\n- Puts me adjacent to apple at (0,8).\n- Next turn I can eat it.\n- Maintains flexibility: from (1,8) I have three safe moves (LEFT to apple, UP to (1,9), RIGHT to (2,8)). \n- Enemy is far, unlikely to interfere.\n\nPotential risk: Enemy might move to a position that threatens me in two turns? For example, enemy could move LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6) etc. But from (4,5), enemy cannot move UP (into its own body at (4,6)? Actually (4,6) is its body segment. So moving UP would be suicide. So enemy likely moves DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. If enemy moves LEFT to (3,5), that's still far from (1,8). So no immediate threat.\n\nThus, the plan is safe and gives apple.\n\nNow consider if moving DOWN or RIGHT could be better? DOWN gives access to bottom-left apples but loses the immediate apple opportunity. RIGHT moves away from the apple. Since I'm behind in apple count, taking a sure apple is valuable.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nNow, I need to output the final move as one word: UP.\n\nI should include a long-term plan in the rationale for next turn. For this turn's output, I can include a plan before the move line. The instructions: \"You may also write a long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" So I should write a plan before the move.\n\nThus, my response will include a plan and then \"UP\".\n\nLet's write the plan: \"Move UP to (1,8) to position for eating apple at (0,8) next turn. After eating, continue towards bottom-left apple cluster while avoiding enemy. Keep options open and monitor enemy movements.\"\n\nNow, final move:Move UP to (1,8) to position for eating the apple at (0,8) next turn. This secures an immediate point, improves my score relative to the enemy, and maintains flexibility with three safe follow-up moves from (1,8). After eating, continue towards the bottom-left apple cluster while monitoring enemy movements and avoiding tight spaces.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Current State:** My head is at (1, 9). My body occupies (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5). The enemy snake #0 is at (3, 4) with a long body trailing right and up. The board has apples scattered, with clusters at (0, 8), (5, 0), and others.\n2.  **Immediate Survival (Turning 22):**\n    *   **UP:** (1, 10) - Off the board (y max is 9). **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 8) - This is my current body segment directly behind my head. Moving backwards kills me. **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 9) - Empty space on the board view (row 9, col 0 is '.'). Check boundaries: x=0, y=9 is valid. No self-collision (body is at y=8 and below). Enemy is at (3,4) - too far. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 9) - Empty space on board view (row 9, col 2 is '.'). Valid. No self-collision. **SAFE.**\n    *   *Note on board view:* The board shows '1' at (1,9), '.' at (0,9) and (2,9).\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Target:** The apple at (0, 8) is extremely close. From (1,9), the fastest path to (0,8) involves going LEFT to (0,9) then DOWN to (0,8). Alternatively, I could go DOWN to (1,8) to get closer, but that move is lethal.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy head is at (3,4). It is currently moving or defending. Its body is extensive at (3,5) through (7,9). It is not an immediate threat to my head's location (1,9) or my immediate safe moves (0,9), (2,9).\n    *   **Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n        *   **LEFT to (0, 9):** Places me adjacent to the apple at (0, 8). From (0,9), I can move DOWN to eat the apple next turn. This also puts me in a corner-like position. Is (0,9) safe next turn? Enemy can't reach me instantly. From (0,9), my next move DOWN to (0,8) is safe (unless enemy moves there, unlikely). After eating (0,8), I will have space to move to (1,8) or (0,7). (1,8) is currently my tail, which will have moved forward by then (assuming I don't grow immediately at (0,9)). Actually, if I eat at (0,8), I grow, so my tail stays at (0,5) temporarily? No, the snake moves simultaneously. If I eat at (0,8), my tail moves from (0,5) to (0,6). The cell (1,8) becomes empty (as my body shifts).\n        *   **RIGHT to (2, 9):** Leads towards the top right. The top right corner (9,9) is blocked by enemy body parts (T). The path right is somewhat blocked by enemy body parts at (7,9), (6,9), (5,9). Moving right seems like a path with a dead end or heavy traffic. It does not immediately secure an apple.\n4.  **Decision:** LEFT is the superior move. It directly approaches the apple at (0,8) and keeps me in a relatively safe zone away from the enemy's current trajectory. While (0,9) is a corner, having the apple at (0,8) allows me to grow and likely clear out of the corner immediately or turn into row 1. The immediate move RIGHT leads away from the nearest apple and towards the enemy's tail zone.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0,9). Next turn, move DOWN to (0,8) to eat the apple. This will give me 6 apples and extend my length, potentially blocking the enemy if they try to pass through (1,8) or (0,7). After eating, I will plan to move towards the cluster at (5,0) or (4,0) via the left edge or center, avoiding the enemy's occupied columns (3-7).\n\nLEFT",

Yes, Snake #0 body: ..., (5, 8), (5, 9) ...).\nSo (0,8) is safe.\n\nThe prompt says \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nI have done that.\nI am at (0,9).\nMy body is at (1,9), (1,8)...\nEnemy is at (4,4)...\nI must move DOWN.\n\nWait, is there any move to (1,8)? No.\nIs there any move to (0,9)? No, I'm there.\nIs there any move to (1,9)? Yes, but it's my body.\nSo DOWN is the only option.\n\nIs there any trick involving the enemy?\nCan the enemy kill me if I move DOWN?\nThe enemy is at (4,4). He moves one step.\nHe could move UP to (4,5).\nHe could move DOWN to (4,3).\nHe could move LEFT to (3,4).\nHe could move RIGHT to (5,4).\nNone of these reach (0,8).\nEven if he moves fast, he can't cover 8 units in 1 turn.\n\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nWait, I should check if I can move to (0,8) given the \"simultaneous movement\" rules.\nIf I move DOWN to (0,8), and my tail (0,6) moves to (0,7), I will occupy (0,7). (0,8) is currently empty (except for the apple).\nWait, the body is (0,7) currently.\nIf I eat the apple at (0,8), I grow.\nMy new body will be:\nHead: (0,8)\nBody: (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)...\nWait.\nCurrent state:\nHead: (0,9)\nBody: (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)\nTail: (0,6)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,8):\nNew Head: (0,8)\nNew Body:\n1. (0,9) (previous head)\n2. (1,9) (previous body 1)\n3. (1,8) (previous body 2)\n4. (1,7) (previous body 3)\n5. (0,7) (previous body 4)\n6. (0,6) (previous body 5)\nSince I ate an apple, the tail (0,6) does not move away (I grow).\nSo the new tail is (0,6).\nThe segment (0,7) is occupied by my body.\nWait, if I move to (0,8), does (0,7) block me?\nNo, (0,7) is my body, but it moves.\nSimultaneous movement:\nMy head moves to (0,8).\nMy body segments shift.\n(0,9) becomes a body part.\n(1,9) becomes a body part...\n(0,7) becomes a body part.\n(0,6) becomes a body part.\nSince I ate an apple, the tail stays at (0,6) (or rather, the segment that was at (0,6) stays).\nSo the cell (0,7) will be occupied by my body in the next turn.\nBut I am moving to (0,8).\nSo I am moving to (0,8).\n(0,7) is not in my way for this move.\nI am moving from (0,9) to (0,8).\nIs (0,8) currently occupied?\nIt has an apple.\nIs it occupied by my body? No.\nIs it occupied by enemy? No.\nSo I can move there.\n\nIs there any risk of collision?\nIf I move to (0,8), and the enemy moves to (0,8)? Impossible.\nIf I move to (0,8), and my body moves into (0,8)? No, my body moves from (0,9) to (0,8) only if I don't eat. Since I eat, I grow, so (0,9) becomes body, (0,8) is head.\nWait.\nIf I DON'T eat (apple is there, so I do eat).\nIf I were NOT eating, and moved to (0,8), my tail (0,6) would move to (0,7). The cell (0,8) would be free for my head.\nSince I AM eating, my tail stays (0,6). The cell (0,8) is free for my head.\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs there any move other than DOWN?\nNo.\n\nSo the move is DOWN.\n\nI should write down the reasoning.\nCurrent position: (0,9).\nAvailable moves:\nUp: Off board (y=10).\nLeft: Off board (x=-1).\nRight: (1,9) - Occupied by my body.\nDown: (0,8) - Empty (Apple).\nChoice: DOWN.\n\nI need to output \"DOWN\".\n\nOne final check.\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 23 / 150\".\n\"Your last move ... LEFT\"\nSo I moved from (1,9) to (0,9).\nNow I am at (0,9).\nThe apples include (0,8).\nThe board view shows 'A' at (0,8).\nEverything checks out.\n\nWhat if the apple was eaten by someone else?\nThe apples list is given in the prompt: \"Apples at: ... (0, 8) ...\".\nIt is explicitly listed.\nSo the apple is there.\n\nWhat if the board view is stale?\nThe board view is consistent with the positions.\nRow 8: `A T ...`\n(0,8) is 'A'.\n(1,8) is 'T' (My body).\nSo (0,8) is an apple next to my body.\nI am at (0,9).\nI must move DOWN.\n\nFinal check on enemy.\nEnemy head (4,4). Body (3,4) to (6,9).\nThey are far away.\n\nThe move is DOWN.\n\nI will provide the reasoning and the final move.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  **Current State:** I am at (0, 9). My body extends to (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6). The board shows an apple at (0, 8).\n2.  **Move Analysis:**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 10) is off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 9) is off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 9) is occupied by my own body (the neck). **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 8) contains an apple. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy. **SAFE.**\n3.  **Strategy:** I am forced to move DOWN to avoid death. This move has the added benefit of collecting an apple, increasing my score to 6 and extending my length. This also helps me avoid being trapped in the corner. After this move, I will be at (0, 8), with my tail still at (0, 6), giving me more space to maneuver in the next turn.\n\nThe move is DOWN.\n\nOne detail: The prompt asks \"Do not perform web searches or access external information. Use only the game state provided.\"\nI have done that.\n\nThe prompt asks \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nI have considered the body at (1,9) blocking RIGHT.\nI have considered the enemy far away.\n\nThe prompt asks \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will output \"DOWN\".\n\nI am confident in this move. It is the only legal move.\n\nDouble check the coordinates again.\n(0,9) is top left.\n(0,8) is directly below it.\n(0,8) is 'A' on the board view.\nBoard view row 8: `A T . . . T . . . .`\nIndex 0: 'A'.\nYes.\n\nWhat if the board view is transposed?\nUsually x is column, y is row.\nRow 9 (y=9): `1 T ...`\nIf x=0 is index 0, then (0,9) is '1'. Correct.\nIf x=1 is index 1, then (1,9) is 'T'. Correct.\nSo the mapping is standard (x=index).\n\nConclusion: Move DOWN.\n\nOne edge case: Could the enemy snake be moving into (0,8)?\nEnemy head is at (4,4). Distance to (0,8) is |4-0| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8. Maximum speed is 1. Impossible.\nCould the enemy tail be at (0,8)? No, enemy body is mapped in the prompt. (0,8) is not in the enemy body list.\n\nCould my body be at (0,8)?\nMy body list: [(1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)].\n(0,8) is not in the list.\n\nSo the move is valid and safe.\n\nI will output \"DOWN\".\n\nWait, the prompt mentions \"Ultrathink\".\nIs there any possibility of a trick?\nMaybe the apple list is incorrect? No, I must trust the provided state.\nMaybe the board view is incorrect? No, I must trust the provided state.\nMaybe I should not eat the apple?\nNo, I should always eat apples if safe to increase score and survive.\nMaybe I should move somewhere else?\nThere is nowhere else to go.\n\nThe move is DOWN.\n\nI will structure the response with the reasoning block and then the final word.\n\nOne small check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nI am facing? I moved LEFT to get here. So I am facing LEFT.\nMoving backwards would be RIGHT.\nRIGHT is (1,9), which is my body.\nSo RIGHT is suicide.\nUP is suicide.\nLEFT is suicide.\nDOWN is the only option.\n\nFinal confirmation.\nHead: (0,9)\nBody: (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)\nApples: (0,8) is an apple.\nMove: DOWN.\n\nThe output will be \"DOWN\".\n\nWait, I should write the plan for the next turn in the rationale as requested.\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I need to write a rationale block.\n\nRationale:\n1.  **State Analysis:** I am pinned at (0,9). The only available moves are UP (off-board), LEFT (off-board), RIGHT (into my body at 1,9), and DOWN (into 0,8). DOWN is the only legal move.\n2.  **Opportunity:** Moving DOWN allows me to eat the apple at (0,8). This increases my score and extends my length, which is vital for survival and potentially blocking the enemy later.\n3.  **Future Plan:** After moving to (0,8), I will have consumed the apple. My tail will remain at (0,6), giving me a length of 7. I will then need to navigate away from the corner. Potential next moves from (0,8) will be RIGHT to (1,8) or DOWN to (0,7). However, (1,8) will be occupied by my body (the segment currently at 1,9 moving to 1,8, etc. - wait, let's trace).\n    *   Current: H(0,9), B1(1,9), B2(1,8)...\n    *   Next (Down/Eat): H(0,8), B1(0,9), B2(1,9), B3(1,8)...\n    *   From H(0,8):\n        *   Up: (0,9) - My body (B1).\n        *   Left: (-1,8) - Off board.\n        *   Down: (0,7) - My body (B4 is 0,7 currently? Yes, B4 is (0,7). Wait, let's check the sequence again.\n            Current Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6)]\n            Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n            If I move Down/Eat:\n            New Head: (0,8)\n            New Body:\n            0: (0,9) [Old Head]\n            1: (1,9) [Old Body 0]\n            2: (1,8) [Old Body 1]\n            3: (1,7) [Old Body 2]\n            4: (0,7) [Old Body 3]\n            5: (0,6) [Old Body 4]\n            So at (0,8), I can go:\n            Up -> (0,9) [My body].\n            Left -> Off board.\n            Down -> (0,7) [My body].\n            Right -> (1,8) [My body?

No.\n\n            Am I dead?\n            It looks like I am in a corner with a body wrapping around.\n            However, I must make a move.\n            The only move available is DOWN to (0,8).\n\n            Is there any possibility that (0,8) is NOT an apple?\n            The list says it is.\n            If it is an apple, I grow.\n            If I grow, I am definitely trapped.\n\n            Is there any possibility that I can turn into the space created by my tail?\n            My tail is at (0,6).\n            If I move to (0,8), my body shifts.\n            The gap between my head and my body is minimal.\n            Head at (0,8).\n            Body at (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6).\n            There is no gap.\n\n            Is there any move to (2,9)?\n            No, I am at (0,9).\n\n            Is there any move to (0,10)?\n            No.\n\n            Is there any move to (1,9)?\n            No, it's occupied.\n\n            Is there any move to (0,8)?\n            Yes.\n\n            So I must move to (0,8).\n\n            Even if it leads to death in 2 turns, it is the only legal move.\n            I cannot stay still.\n            I cannot move into walls or myself.\n\n            Therefore, I must move DOWN.\n\n            Is there any nuance?\n            Maybe the enemy moves and crashes into my body, freeing a space?\n            If the enemy crashes into my body, the enemy dies.\n            My body remains.\n            If the enemy crashes into (1,9), my body at (1,9) remains.\n            If the enemy crashes into (0,7), my body at (0,7) remains.\n            So my body blocks me regardless.\n\n            Maybe the enemy crashes into my HEAD?\n            If enemy moves to (0,8) at the same time as me?\n            Impossible.\n            If enemy moves to (0,9) at the same time as me?\n            I am moving to (0,8), so (0,9) will be my body.\n            If enemy moves to (0,9), they hit my body (assuming I have moved).\n            Wait.\n            Turn 24:\n            I move H(0,9) -> (0,8).\n            Enemy moves E_head -> ...\n            Simultaneous.\n            If Enemy moves to (0,9):\n            My head is at (0,8).\n            My body is at (0,9) (old head).\n            Enemy head moves to (0,9).\n            Enemy hits my body. Enemy dies.\n            I survive.\n\n            But what if the enemy moves to (0,8)?\n            Enemy is at (4,4). Impossible.\n\n            So the only outcome is I move to (0,8) and then I am trapped.\n\n            Is there any other interpretation of the board?\n            Maybe the \"T\" at (1,8) is not my body?\n            Prompt: \"Your snake (ID: 1): ... Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6)]\"\n            Yes, (1,8) is my body.\n\n            Okay, I have to move DOWN.\n            I will explain that I am forced into a trap but it is the only move.\n\n            Wait, could the apple at (0,8) be eaten by the enemy?\n            No, enemy is far.\n\n            Could the apple at (0,8) be a trap?\n            No, apples are just points.\n\n            Okay, I will write the plan.\n            Move DOWN to (0,8).\n            Plan: Eat apple. Prepare for potential death next turn due to being boxed in, but this is the only legal move.\n\n            Wait, is there any move to (1,9) if I consider the \"simultaneous\" movement freeing it?\n            No, (1,9) is my neck. I can never move into my neck.\n\n            Final check on the \"BACKWARDS\" rule.\n            \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n            If I am at (0,9), and my previous head was (1,9).\n            If I move RIGHT to (1,9), I am moving back to where I came from.\n            That is the definition of \"directly backwards\".\n            So RIGHT is definitely death.\n\n            So DOWN is the only move.\n\n            I will output \"DOWN\".\n\n            One last check. Is it possible that (0,8) is not an apple?\n            \"Apples at: (0, 8)\"\n            Yes.\n\n            Is it possible that (0,8) is occupied by enemy body?\n            \"Snake #0 ... Body: ... (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9)\"\n            No.\n\n            Okay.\n\n            Rationale:\n            I am trapped at (0,9). The only valid move is DOWN to (0,8) to avoid immediate death from walls or self-collision. Even though this leads to a tight spot (potentially trapping myself next turn), I must take the only available move. I will also eat an apple, increasing my score.\n\n            Plan for next turn:\n            From (0,8), I will likely be trapped. I will check if any moves open up. If not, I will try to crash into the enemy if possible to take them down with me? No, the goal is to win. If I am trapped, I am dead. But I must play turn by turn.\n\n            Actually, wait. If I am at (0,8) and my body surrounds me...\n            Head: (0,8)\n            Body: (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)\n            I can only move to (0,9), (1,8), or (0,7).\n            All are occupied by my body.\n            I will die on Turn 25.\n\n            Is there any chance the tail moves?\n            Only if I don't eat.\n            But I MUST eat because there is an apple at (0,8).\n            If there was NO apple at (0,8), I would move to (0,8) and my tail would advance to (0,7).\n            Head (0,8).\n            Body: (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7).\n            Neighbors:\n            Up (0,9): Body.\n            Down (0,7): Body (Tail).\n            Right (1,8): Body.\n            Still trapped.\n\n            So even without the apple, I am dead next turn.\n            The apple just delays the death slightly (by extending length) but doesn't change the geometry of the trap.\n\n            However, I must make a move.\n            I will move DOWN.\n\n            The prompt says \"Do not add anything after that word.\"\n            So the last line must be \"DOWN\".\n\n            I will write the reasoning clearly.\n\n            Wait, is there any other move I missed?\n            What if I move to (0,8) and the apple is not there?\n            The list says it is there.\n            I must trust the state.\n\n            Okay.\n\n            One final thought: Is it possible to move diagonally? No.\n            Is it possible to stay still? No.\n\n            So the move is DOWN.\n\n            I will write the rationale now.\n\n            Rationale:\n            I am at (0,9). My body blocks (1,9) and (0,8) (indirectly, but wait, (0,8) is currently empty).\n            Actually, (0,8) is currently empty (it has an apple).\n            My body is at (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6).\n            So (0,8) is empty *now*.\n            I can move there.\n            The trap happens *after* I move there.\n\n            So the move is valid and safe for this turn.\n\n            Plan:\n            Move DOWN to (0,8) to collect the apple and survive the current turn. Recognize that this move places my head into a position surrounded by my own body and the wall, likely leading to death on the subsequent turn. However, it is the only legal move available.\n\n            Final move: DOWN.\n\n            Double check the prompt requirements.\n            \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n            \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n            So \"DOWN\" must be the very last thing.\n\n            I will put the plan and rationale before it.\n\n            One detail: The prompt says \"You are controlling a snake... Think very hard... Ultrathink\".\n            The trap is real.\n            But I must play the move.\n\n            I'll output the response**START RATIONALE**\n**Analysis of Current State:**\nMy head is located at (0, 9). The available moves are:\n- **UP:** (0, 10) is off the board (max y is 9). **DEAD.**\n- **LEFT:** (-1, 9) is off the board (min x is 0). **DEAD.**\n- **RIGHT:** (1, 9) is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving here is a direct backward move into my own body. **DEAD.**\n- **DOWN:** (0, 8) is currently empty and contains an apple. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy. **SAFE.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI am forced to move **DOWN** to (0, 8). This is the only legal move that keeps me alive for this turn. While this move places my head into a position where I will be surrounded by my own body and the wall on the next turn (likely resulting in death unless the board state changes dramatically), I must take the only move available to me. Additionally, moving DOWN allows me to eat the apple at (0, 8), increasing my score to 6.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nFrom (0, 8), I will be boxed in by my own body and the walls. I will check for any opening, but it is likely a terminal position. I will continue to monitor the enemy snake's position in case they crash into my body, which might alter the board state, but I must play the current turn optimally.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
