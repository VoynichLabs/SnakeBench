This positions me well for the next apple.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: Moves me away from the apple cluster toward the perimeter. Less efficient.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe apple cluster at (4, 6) and (5, 5) is my best target. Moving LEFT to (5, 7) positions me optimally to collect these apples next turn by moving DOWN.\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 7) is moving slowly and not a threat yet. I have time to execute my apple collection strategy.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:**\n- Turn 4: After moving to (5, 7), move DOWN to reach either (5, 5) or (4, 6)\n- Continue dominating the central apple cluster before the enemy can intercept\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movement pattern\n- After clearing the cluster, target the apple at (9, 3) if still available\n\nLEFT",

It keeps me heading toward the (5, 9) apple at the top\n2. It maintains flexibility to reach (9, 3) on the right\n3. It keeps distance from the enemy snake (still far behind in score)\n4. It positions me well for the upcoming turns\n\n**Long-term Strategy for Next Turns:**\nTarget the (5, 9) apple in the upper region first, then work toward (9, 3). The enemy is significantly behind (1 vs 4 apples), so focus on efficient apple collection rather than defensive play. Maintain control of the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

The cluster of apples on the left side (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0) is more accessible than the isolated apple at (9, 3).\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- **UP to (4, 8)**: Moves away from the apple cluster. Not strategic.\n- **DOWN to (4, 6)**: Starts moving down toward the bottom-left apple cluster. Good direction.\n- **LEFT to (3, 7)**: Moves horizontally left. Also good direction toward the cluster.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT move me toward the apple cluster. LEFT moves me closer to x=0 (where multiple apples are), while DOWN moves me toward y=0. \n\nGiven I'm at y=7 and need to reach y=0-4 region, I should start moving down. However, LEFT also moves me horizontally closer to the x=0 area where multiple apples cluster.\n\nLet me think about the path: To reach the left-side apples efficiently, I should move left first to decrease x coordinate, then down to decrease y coordinate. LEFT at (3, 7) keeps me in the middle-upper area and starts the leftward journey.\n\nActually, DOWN to (4, 6) positions me better for a downward trajectory toward y=0, while I'm already at x=4 which isn't too far left.\n\nI'll go LEFT to get closer to the x=0 apple cluster while maintaining reasonable flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving left and down to reach the apple cluster at (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0). Keep monitoring enemy position to avoid collisions. Once I collect several apples from this cluster, reassess positioning for the remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

It collects an apple, advances my score to 7, and continues my efficient bottom-left cluster collection strategy. The enemy is far away at (9, 5), so there's no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue collecting the bottom-left apple cluster systematically:\n- Turn 23: Collect (0, 1) \u2713 (this move)\n- Turn 24+: Move UP to collect (0, 4), then navigate to (1, 4) and (2, 4)\n- Monitor enemy position, but currently I have significant board control and a lead of 7-3 once this apple is collected\n- Keep eyes on (6, 1) as a secondary apple target if the left column apples run out\n\nLEFT",

It also does not place me directly in the path of any known enemy head (the nearest opponent head is at (4,\u202f7) and would need several moves to reach (7,\u202f9)).  \n- **RIGHT** would move me to (9,\u202f9). While safe now, it puts me at the board edge, limiting future movement options and moving me away from the nearest apple at (4,\u202f9).\n\nAmong the safe moves, moving LEFT brings me closer to an apple I can eat (the one at (4,\u202f9)) and keeps my body oriented so that I can later snake downward or rightward without immediately hitting a wall. It also leaves multiple viable follow\u2011up directions (down, left, or even right later) while avoiding immediate self\u2011collision or likely head\u2011on clashes with the opponent.\n\n**Plan:** Continue moving left toward the apple at (4,\u202f9), staying aware of my growing length and the opponent\u2019s position, and keep the option to shift down or right in subsequent turns once the leftward path is clear.\n\nLEFT",

This gives me:\n1. Safety from the enemy (creating distance)\n2. Access to move down the board to collect apples at (4, 1), (1, 2), and eventually (8, 1), (9, 2)\n3. Flexibility for future moves\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\n- Turn 41: Move LEFT to (3, 9)\n- Turn 42+: Move DOWN from (3, 9) to start traveling down the left side of the board\n- Target (1, 2) which is on the left side, then work toward the bottom apples at (4, 1), (8, 1), (9, 2)\n- Maintain safe distance from Enemy #0\n- Current lead: 15 vs 7 (8 apples ahead) - continue collecting safely\n\nLEFT",

It also positions the head at (6,8) which is one step closer to the apple at (7,7) and still allows a subsequent RIGHT or another DOWN without immediate self\u2011collision.\n\nPlan: Head down to (6,8), then consider moving RIGHT to (7,8) to get closer to (7,7); after that we can head left or down toward other apples while monitoring enemy movement.\n\nDOWN",

(3, 2) is in my body \u2717\n   - UNSAFE - would die\n\n**Valid moves:** UP, LEFT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLEFT to (1, 2):\n- Collects an apple immediately (+1 apple, now 17)\n- Excellent move - gains a point\n- Maintains safe distance from enemy (7+ cells away)\n- Opens up paths to (0, 0) and (0, 6) apples on the left side\n\nUP to (2, 3):\n- Moves away from the immediate apple at (1, 2)\n- I'd need to backtrack after\n- Less efficient than LEFT\n\n**Optimal choice:** LEFT to (1, 2)\n\nThis is a clear winner - I collect an apple immediately, extending my lead to 17-10. After eating this apple, I'll have more options on the left side of the board to collect (0, 0) and (0, 6).\n\n**Short-term plan (next 3 turns):**\n- Turn 55: Move LEFT to (1, 2) and collect apple #17\n- Turn 56: Move LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1) depending on board state\n- Turn 57: Continue left/down toward (0, 0) apple to collect #18\n\nLEFT",

After consuming an apple and growing, I'll need to carefully navigate upward or find space to maneuver. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position - currently it's far away in the top-right corner, so collision risk is low for the immediate future.\n\nRIGHT",

This is an apple! **SAFE** \u2713\n   - Eating apple at (6, 0) brings me to 21 apples.\n   - Next move could go to (7, 0) and continue right, or UP to (6, 1).\n\n3. **DOWN to (5, -1)**: Outside bounds (y < 0). **UNSAFE - DEATH**\n\n4. **UP to (5, 1)**: Within bounds \u2713, not my body \u2713, not enemy body \u2713. **SAFE** \u2713\n   - Moves me toward the apple at (5, 3), but doesn't immediately grab an apple.\n   - This opens a path upward.\n\n**Analysis:**\nBetween RIGHT and UP, RIGHT is clearly superior because:\n- It takes me directly to an apple at (6, 0)\n- I'm still far from the enemy snake\n- After eating this apple, I'll have 21 apples and can continue collecting more\n- Moving right along the bottom row gives me multiple options\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter eating (6, 0), I should look at the nearby apple at (7, 7) while also collecting (5, 3). The enemy is at (7, 8), so I need to be careful around that area.

Yes, (6, 0) is my second segment.\n   - Moving down would be moving into my own body **UNSAFE - DEATH**\n\n4. **UP to (6, 2)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - Moves me up toward apples at (5, 3) and (6, 8)\n   - Opens path upward\n   - **SAFE** \u2713\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n- LEFT (5, 1): Gets me closer to apple at (5, 3) - I'd be 2 cells away diagonally\n- UP (6, 2): Gets me closer to apple at (6, 8) directly above, also moves toward (5, 3)\n- RIGHT (7, 1): Moves away from apples, limits options\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n- UP positions me directly below the apple at (6, 8), which is a valuable prize\n- UP keeps me in the middle column where I can reach multiple apples\n- LEFT would require me to then move up, then left again to get (5, 3)\n- UP is more direct toward the high-value apples at (5, 8) and (6, 8)\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 7), but moving UP to (6, 2) doesn't create an immediate collision risk since they're far away. I should continue moving UP to collect the apples in the upper region.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nContinue UP to reach the apple cluster at (5, 8) and (6, 8). Then reassess.

This is the same x-coordinate! If I move UP, I could be heading toward a head-on collision with the enemy.\n\n**Evaluating all four moves from (5, 2):**\n\n1. **UP to (5, 3)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - This is where an apple is! \u2713\n   - BUT: Enemy is at (5, 8) directly above me\n   - If I move UP and enemy moves DOWN, we could collide at (5, 5) or (5, 6)\n   - However, the enemy needs to move DOWN 5 times to reach (5, 3) where I currently am\n   - Enemy moving DOWN would take it to (5, 7) this turn, not an immediate collision\n   - Moving UP to grab the apple at (5, 3) is achievable this turn!\n   - **SAFE THIS TURN** \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 1)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Moves away from enemy \u2713\n   - But doesn't move toward any nearby apples\n   - **SAFE but suboptimal**\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 2)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Moves toward apple at (4, 6) (1 left, 4 up)\n   - Moves away from directly opposite the enemy\n   - **SAFE** \u2713\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 2)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - My body is at (6, 2) - this is my second segment!\n   - Moving right would be moving into my own body\n   - **UNSAFE - DEATH**\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\nUP to (5, 3) is clearly the best move because:\n1. It's safe (the enemy at (5, 8) won't collide with me this turn)\n2. It grabs an apple immediately, getting me to 22 apples\n3. I'll be closer to 50 apples (the winning threshold)\n4. It grows my body, which can help block the enemy or defend territory\n5. After eating this apple, I can reassess and potentially move toward (4, 6) or continue strategically\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter grabbing the apple at (5, 3), I'll have 22 apples. The enemy has 15. I need 28 more apples to reach 50 and win. I should:\n1. Continue grabbing nearby apples (4, 6) and (0, 6)\n2. Monitor the enemy's position to avoid head-on collisions\n3. Keep my body flexible to avoid traps\n4. Prioritize safe, reachable apples over risky territory\n\nUP",

Position (5, 4) is not in body \u2713\n   - Moves toward multiple apples \u2713\n   - Enemy at (4, 8): if enemy moves, most likely directions won't collide with (5, 4) \u2713\n   - **SAFE** \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2)**:\n   - This is my body segment (second in the list)\n   - **UNSAFE - DEATH** \u2717\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Check body: (4, 3) is not in my body \u2713\n   - Moves toward apple at (4, 6) \u2713\n   - **SAFE** \u2713\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 3)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Check body: (6, 3) is not in my body \u2713\n   - Moves away from nearby apples\n   - **SAFE but suboptimal** \u2713\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is very close - just 1 left and 3 up. If I move LEFT now to (4, 3), then UP three times, I can reach it. However, I should check if UP is better this turn.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 4) keeps me flexible:\n- I can continue UP toward (6, 9)\n- Or move LEFT next turn toward (4, 6)\n- Maintains good positioning\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 3) commits me toward (4, 6):\n- Gets me closer to that apple\n- Still flexible for other directions\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 8). If I move UP to (5, 4), and the enemy moves (likely DOWN or LEFT given apple positions), we maintain safe distance. The closest apple (4, 6) is between us, so moving toward it makes sense.\n\nLEFT seems stronger because:\n1. It directly moves me toward the closest apple at (4, 6)\n2. After eating that, I'll have 24 apples and good positioning for (1, 4)\n3. It moves me away from the enemy's likely path\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT \u2192 UP toward (4, 6). After eating it, reassess. The enemy has 16 apples, I have 23. I need 27 more to reach 50. Focus on the cluster of apples on the left side: (1, 4), (1, 8), (0, 6).

Position (4, 4) is not in my body \u2713\n   - Directly moves toward the closest apple at (4, 6) \u2713\n   - Safe from enemy: Enemy is at (4, 9). The enemy will move simultaneously this turn. Even if they move DOWN, they'd go to (4, 8), still 4 cells away \u2713\n   - **SAFE** \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 2)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Check body: (4, 2) is not in my body \u2713\n   - Moves away from closest apple \u2717\n   - Suboptimal strategically\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 3)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Body check: (3, 3) is in my body! My body has (3, 3) at position 20\n   - **UNSAFE - DEATH** \u2717\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 3)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Body check: (5, 3) is my immediate body segment (position 0)\n   - **UNSAFE - DEATH** \u2717\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nOnly UP and DOWN are safe. UP is clearly superior because:\n- The apple at (4, 6) is only 3 cells directly above my head\n- If I move UP three turns in a row, I can reach and eat it\n- This will give me 23 apples total\n- Moving UP keeps me on track toward the closest apple\n- The enemy is at (4, 9), and moving UP toward (4, 6) doesn't increase collision risk since the enemy is further away and likely has their own targets\n\n**Long-term plan for next 3 turns:** Continue moving UP toward (4, 6). After eating that apple, reassess the board and consider the next closest apple cluster on the left side: (1, 4) and (1, 8). The enemy currently has 16 apples vs my 22, so I maintain a lead. Focus on efficiently collecting the remaining apples while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

Position (4, 6) is not in my body \u2713\n   - This cell contains an apple! I'll eat it and grow \u2713\n   - Enemy head at (6, 9) moving simultaneously - no collision risk \u2713\n   - **SAFE** \u2713 and **APPLE COLLECTED** \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 4)**:\n   - This is my immediate body segment at position 1\n   - **UNSAFE - DEATH** \u2717\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 5)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Body check: Not in my body \u2713\n   - Safe but moves away from the apple I can eat this turn\n   - **SAFE but suboptimal** \u26a0\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5)**:\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Body check: Not in my body \u2713\n   - Safe but moves away from the apple I can eat this turn\n   - **SAFE but suboptimal** \u26a0\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nUP is the clear choice! I'm directly adjacent to the apple at (4, 6), and moving UP will:\n1. Let me eat the apple and grow to 23 apples collected\n2. Extend my lead over Snake #0 (who has 17)\n3. Keep me on track for reaching 50 apples and winning\n\n**Plan for next turns (Turn 72+):**\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 6), I'll have more flexibility. My next targets should be:\n- The (0, 6) apple cluster (nearby after reaching (4, 6))\n- The (1, 4) apple below\n- Continue focusing on collecting apples efficiently while maintaining distance from Snake #0\n\nThe path to victory is clear: keep collecting apples and maintain my lead.

Although (7,9) is part of the body list, it is not the segment directly behind the head, and moving there keeps the snake on the top edge where it can continue to grow without being forced into a tighter corridor.  \nMoving right also stays away from the enemy head at (4,5) and preserves the possibility of eventually reaching the apple at (7,2) while maintaining multiple future safe options.  \n\nPlan: Continue moving rightward to keep the head on the top row, grow toward the apple at (7,2), and stay clear of the enemy\u2019s path.  \nRIGHT",
