          "rationale": "My snake is at (5,2), body empty. The enemy snake is at (2,0), also body empty. Apples are at the coordinates listed. I need to avoid the enemy and not die.\n\nFirst, check immediate death moves: moving into self (none), moving off board, or into enemy body (enemy body is empty). The only possible immediate danger is if the enemy head moves into my intended move cell, but since moves are simultaneous, that's a risk we'll consider after choosing a move.\n\nList possible moves:\n- UP: from (5,2) to (5,3). Is (5,3) occupied? Let's check board: row 3 (y=3) has: A . . . . . . A . A (from left to right x=0 to 9). At x=5, y=3: the row shows at x=5: the character after \"A . . . . \" which is the 6th character? Actually row 3: \"A . . . . . . A . A\" \u2013 let's index: x=0: A, 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: A, 8: ., 9: A. So (5,3) is '.' empty. So UP is safe from static obstacles.\n- DOWN: to (5,1). Row 1: \" . . . . . . . . . .\" so (5,1) is '.' empty. But (5,1) is adjacent to (5,2) which is my head? Actually moving down would go into (5,1), which is behind my current head? That's moving backwards? My head is at (5,2), moving down would be into (5,1) which is the cell directly behind if my body were there, but I have no body. However, moving into a cell that is not currently occupied by my body is safe. But note: after moving, my previous head becomes body, but since I have no body, moving down is allowed as long as (5,1) is empty. However, I must also consider that moving backwards into my own tail is only dangerous if I have a tail. Since I have no body, it's safe. So DOWN is safe.\n- LEFT: to (4,2). Row 2: \" . A . . . 0 . . . .\" \u2013 at x=4,y=2: row 2: x=0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: 0 (my head), 6: ., etc. So x=4 is '.' empty. So LEFT safe.\n- RIGHT: to (6,2). Row 2: x=6: '.' empty. So RIGHT safe.\n\nAll four directions seem safe from static obstacles. Now consider enemy snake. Enemy head at (2,0). Enemy has no body. So if I move, enemy will also move. I need to avoid head-on collision and avoid moving into enemy's future head or body. Since enemy body is empty, only risk is head-on collision (both heads moving to same cell) or moving into enemy's body (none). So we need to predict enemy's move. Enemy at (2,0). Possible moves: UP to (2,1), DOWN to (2,-1) off board, LEFT to (1,0), RIGHT to (3,0). So enemy cannot move DOWN (off board). Likely enemy will move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But we don't know. We must assume worst case.\n\nWe also need to consider that we might want to move towards apples. Looking at apple positions: (4,6), (8,6), (4,4), (6,6), (1,7), (0,4), (9,3), (1,2), (5,7), (7,0), (2,5), (2,7), (3,0), (0,3), (7,3). Our head (5,2). Which apples are reachable? (5,7) is straight up 5 steps. (4,4) is left and up. (2,5) is left and up. (1,2) is left and down? (1,2) is x=1,y=2, that's left and up? Actually from (5,2) to (1,2) is left 4 steps. (3,0) is down and left? (3,0) is x=3,y=0, that's down-left. (7,3) is right and up.\n\nWe should also consider enemy proximity. Enemy at (2,0). If we move towards left side, we might get closer to enemy. But enemy might move away. We need to think about long-term: outlasting enemy. Since we are both at 0 apples, we need to grow. Possibly avoid immediate conflict.\n\nLet's analyze each direction:\n\n1. UP to (5,3):\n   - Moves closer to apples (4,4), (5,7), etc.\n   - Safe from board edges.\n   - Potential conflict: if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,0) or UP to (2,1), no direct collision.\n   - Check if (5,3) is safe from enemy head next turn? Enemy could move to (5,3) only if they move from (2,0) in some sequence? Not in one move; distance is 3 x and 3 y, impossible. So no head-on collision possible next turn.\n   - After move, we will be at (5,3), tail will be (5,2) if we eat an apple? Actually we haven't eaten an apple yet, so we will grow only if we move onto an apple. (5,3) is not an apple (check: apple at (5,7) not (5,3)). So no growth. So our body will be just (5,2) after move? Actually snake moves: head moves to new cell, tail moves forward if no apple eaten. Since we have no body, after moving, we will have a body segment? Actually snake starts with head only. When we move without eating, the head moves, and the tail stays? Wait, typical snake: if you don't eat, the tail moves forward one step, so the snake length remains 1. So after moving, we still have only a head at new position, no body. So no self-collision issues.\n   - So UP seems safe.\n\n2. DOWN to (5,1):\n   - Moves closer to apples at (5,7)? Actually down is away from most apples. But there are apples at (7,0) and (3,0) and (0,3) maybe. (5,1) is not an apple.\n   - Board: row 1 y=1 is all '.' so safe.\n   - Potential conflict: enemy at (2,0) could move RIGHT to (3,0) or UP to (2,1) etc. Not likely to collide.\n   - However, moving down might lead to a dead end later? Possibly but not immediate.\n   - Note: (5,1) is adjacent to (4,1) which is empty, (6,1) empty, (5,2) (my previous head) empty. So many exits.\n   - But moving down might waste time since apples are mostly up and left/right.\n\n3. LEFT to (4,2):\n   - Moves left, closer to apples at (4,4), (4,6), (2,5), etc.\n   - (4,2) is empty.\n   - Risk: enemy at (2,0) might move RIGHT to (3,0) or UP to (2,1). If I move LEFT to (4,2), no immediate collision.\n   - However, note that (1,2) is an apple at x=1,y=2. That's left from (4,2) by 3 steps. Could be a target.\n   - But also (2,5) is up-left.\n   - LEFT might bring us closer to enemy territory? Enemy is at (2,0), so not too close.\n\n4. RIGHT to (6,2):\n   - Moves right, closer to apples at (6,6), (7,3), (8,6), (9,3).\n   - (6,2) empty.\n   - Safe.\n\nAll directions seem viable. However, we should consider the enemy's possible moves and potential collisions. Since we don't know enemy's move, we need to choose a move that minimizes risk of head-on collision. The enemy is at (2,0). Which of my possible move destinations could the enemy reach in one move? Enemy can move to: (2,1), (1,0), (3,0). So enemy cannot reach (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2) because those are at least 2 cells away. So no head-on collision possible next turn regardless of my move. So all four moves are safe from head-on collision.\n\nNow, we should consider future options. We want to keep multiple safe follow-up moves available. For each direction, we can see the surrounding empty cells.\n\n- From (5,3): adjacent cells: (5,4) up, (5,2) down (previous head, but empty now), (4,3) left, (6,3) right. Check board: (5,4) is empty? row 4: \"A . . . A . . . . .\" at x=5: row 4: x=0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:.,6:.,7:.,8:.,9:. So (5,4) is '.' empty. (4,3) row 3 x=4 is '.' empty. (6,3) row 3 x=6 is '.' empty. So plenty of options.\n\n- From (5,1): adjacent: (5,2) up (my previous head, empty), (5,0) down (row 0: \" . . 1 A . . . A . .\" at x=5: row 0: x=0:.,1:.,2:1,3:A,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:A,8:.,9:. So (5,0) is '.' empty. (4,1) left: row 1 x=4 is '.' empty. (6,1) right: row 1 x=6 is '.' empty. So also many options.\n\n- From (4,2): adjacent: (4,3) up (empty), (4,1) down (row 1 x=4 '.'), (3,2) left (row 2 x=3 '.'), (5,2) right (empty). All empty.\n\n- From (6,2): adjacent: (6,3) up (empty), (6,1) down (empty), (5,2) left (empty), (7,2) right (row 2 x=7 '.' empty). All empty.\n\nSo all directions keep options open.\n\nNow, consider apple proximity. We want to start moving towards clusters. The nearest apples? Let's compute distances from (5,2) to various apples:\n\n- (4,4): dx=1, dy=2 -> distance 3 (Manhattan)\n- (5,7): dx=0, dy=5 -> 5\n- (4,6): dx=1, dy=4 -> 5\n- (2,5): dx=3, dy=3 -> 6\n- (1,2): dx=4, dy=0 -> 4\n- (7,3): dx=2, dy=1 -> 3\n- (3,0): dx=2, dy=2 -> 4\n- (7,0): dx=2, dy=2 -> 4\n\nSo closest are (4,4) and (7,3) both distance 3. (4,4) is up-left, (7,3) is right-up.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I go from (5,2) to (4,2), distance to (4,4) becomes 2 (dx=0, dy=2) -> actually from (4,2) to (4,4) is 2 steps up. That's good.\nIf I move RIGHT, to (6,2), distance to (7,3) becomes 1 (dx=1, dy=1) -> actually from (6,2) to (7,3) is 1 step right and 1 step up, Manhattan 2? Wait Manhattan: |6-7|+|2-3|=1+1=2. So still 2.\nIf I move UP, to (5,3), distance to (4,4) becomes |5-4|+|3-4|=1+1=2, to (7,3) becomes |5-7|+|3-3|=2+0=2.\nIf I move DOWN, to (5,1), distances increase: to (4,4) becomes |5-4|+|1-4|=1+3=4, to (7,3) becomes |5-7|+|1-3|=2+2=4. So DOWN moves away from both nearest apples.\n\nThus DOWN is least favorable for apple proximity.\n\nNow consider enemy's potential long-term strategy. Enemy at (2,0) has apples nearby: (3,0) is right adjacent, (1,2) is up-left, (0,3) is up-left, (0,4) is up-left, (1,7) far, etc. Enemy might go for (3,0) first. That's an apple at (3,0). If enemy moves RIGHT to (3,0) next turn, they will eat that apple and grow. Then they might become a threat. We should consider that if we move LEFT, we are moving towards the same region as enemy, potentially causing conflict later. If we move RIGHT, we are moving away from enemy and towards a different apple cluster (right side). That might be safer and allow us to grow without competition.\n\nAlso, note there are many apples on the right side: (5,7), (6,6), (7,3), (8,6), (9,3). On the left side: (4,4), (4,6), (2,5), (2,7), (1,7), (1,2), (0,3), (0,4). So both sides have clusters.\n\nWe need to decide which direction gives us a better long-term plan. Since the enemy is on the left side (x=2), if we go right, we might avoid direct competition for a while. However, we might also want to secure some apples before the enemy does.\n\nBut note that the enemy is at (2,0) and (3,0) is an apple. If the enemy moves right to (3,0) and eats it, they will grow and then potentially move up. Our current head is at (5,2). If we move left towards (4,2) or up towards (5,3), we are moving closer to the left-side apples but also closer to the enemy's path. That could lead to confrontation later.\n\nIf we move right to (6,2), we are heading towards a different set of apples and away from the enemy. That seems like a good strategy to outlast: grow while avoiding the enemy.\n\nBut we must also consider that the board is small (10x10) and eventually we might meet. However, at this early stage, moving away from the enemy is likely safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if we move right, we might be moving towards the apple at (7,3) which is only 2 steps away (from (6,2) to (7,3) is one right and one up, but we need to actually reach it). However, note that (7,3) is an apple. If we go right, we could potentially get there in two moves: (6,2) -> (7,2) -> (7,3) or (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (7,3). But we must be careful not to be blocked by enemy or body.\n\nIf we move up, we are heading towards (4,4) and (5,7). (4,4) is an apple, but note that (4,4) is currently empty? Yes, apple there. From (5,3) we can go up-left to (4,4) in one move? Actually from (5,3) to (4,4) is up-left, not a direct move; we need two moves: first left to (4,3) then up to (4,4), or first up to (5,4) then left to (4,4). Either way, two moves.\n\nIf we move left, we are moving directly towards (4,4) and (2,5) etc. (4,4) is 2 steps away from (4,2) after moving left. So from (4,2), we could go up twice to (4,4). That's also two moves.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's possible moves. If enemy moves right to (3,0) and eats (3,0), they will grow. If enemy moves up to (2,1), they might be heading towards (2,5) or (1,2). If enemy moves left to (1,0), that's off board? Actually (1,0) is on board (x=1,y=0). But (1,0) is empty? Row 0: x=1 is '.' empty. So possible.\n\nWe should also think about board boundaries and trapping. The board is 10x10, so plenty of space.\n\nGiven that we are at turn 1 and both snakes have 0 apples, we want to start collecting apples safely. I think moving RIGHT is a good initial move because it moves us away from the enemy and towards a cluster of apples on the right side. This reduces early conflict and allows us to grow without interference.\n\nLet's check if moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe from any other snake? No other snakes. So yes.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that moving RIGHT does not cause a head-on collision next turn. As reasoned, enemy cannot reach (6,2) in one move. So safe.\n\nThus, my move will be RIGHT.\n\nNow, I must provide the final answer as exactly one word: RIGHT.\n\nBut before that, I should include a long-term plan or rationale. The instructions say: \"You may also write a long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should write a plan before the move. The plan should be in the format like last time: \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" etc. But that was from the system. I think I should write my plan in plain text, then the move.\n\nI'll write a concise plan.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT towards the right-side apple cluster (7,3), (5,7), etc. Avoid enemy on left. Grow safely, stay flexible, watch enemy moves.\n\nNow, final move: RIGHT.**Long-term plan:** Move towards the right-side apples (7,3, 5,7, etc.) to avoid early conflict with the enemy snake on the left. Prioritize safe growth, keep options open, and monitor enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Strategic Evaluation (Ranking Safe Moves):**\n\n*   **Option 1: UP (to 7,3)**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   **Immediate Gain:** Eats an apple (+1 Score, grows tail).\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves to the center-right of the board (row 3).\n        *   **Access:** (7,3) is adjacent to other apples: (7,0) directly below (2 turns away if we go down), and (6,0), (9,3) nearby.\n        *   **Safety:** Moving *into* a known apple location is usually safer than moving into empty space because apples are guaranteed to be empty (unless an enemy snake is also eating it, but apple cells are not walls).\n    *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN (to 7,1)**\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward apples at (7,0) and (6,0).\n    *   **Cons:** No immediate apple. Closer to Enemy Snake #1 (Head at 3,1). Distance: |7-3| + |1-1| = 4. This is a safe distance for now, but moving closer slightly increases risk of head-on collision if the enemy moves right aggressively.\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT (to 6,2)**\n    *   **Pros:** Central movement.\n    *   **Cons:** No immediate apple. Moves horizontally toward the enemy (Distance to enemy: |6-3| + |2-1| = 3+1=4). Still safe, but less aggressive than UP.\n\n*   **Option 4: RIGHT (to 8,2)**\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward (9,3) apple (distance 2).\n    *   **Cons:** No immediate apple. Moves toward the right edge (9,9). While (8,2) is safe, moving right repeatedly could eventually trap me against the wall if the enemy cuts off the interior. However, on turn 3, this is not a risk.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction:**\n- Enemy Snake #1 (3,1) is currently low on apples (1) and positioned on the left side.\n- It likely wants to eat apples at (1,2) or (2,5) or (4,4).\n- If it moves UP to (3,2), it gets closer to (2,5).\n- If it moves DOWN, it hits its own tail at (3,0)? No, its tail is at (3,0). Moving down to (3,0) is valid, but it would eat nothing.\n- **Risk of Head-on:** If I go UP to (7,3) and the enemy goes RIGHT to (4,1) and then eventually... no, the distance is too large. The only immediate danger would be if the enemy is moving rapidly towards my path, but at this distance, it's negligible.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (7,3) is the optimal move. It provides an immediate score, increases length (making the tail longer, which is a buffer against self-collision later), and positions the head in a central area with multiple apple options available next turn (down to (7,0), left to (6,3) -> (6,0), etc.).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the apple at (7,3) immediately. From (7,3), evaluate the cluster of apples at (7,0), (6,0), and (9,3). Avoid engaging the enemy snake on the left side until necessary; focus on maximizing score efficiency.\n\nUP",

It is safe now but may put me into contested space and reduce distance from the opponent.\n- LEFT (2,1): moves toward the left cluster (apple at (1,2)) and keeps options, but slightly closer to board edge.\n- UP (3,2): moves toward the upper-left apple cluster (e.g., (2,5),(1,7),(2,7)) while staying central enough to preserve escape routes.

Board Overview:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (7, 3)\n  - Body: [(7, 2)]\n  - Apples: 1\n  - Previous Move: UP (from (7, 2) to (7, 3)).\n  - **Effect:** I just ate the apple at (7, 3). My tail at (7, 2) will not move this turn, so my body occupies (7, 2) and (7, 3).\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (3, 2)\n  - Body: [(3, 1)]\n  - Apples: 1\n  - Previous Move: Likely UP (from (3, 1) to (3, 2)).\n\n**2.

No. (Body is (7,2) and (7,3)). Safe.\n    *   Enemy Collision: Is it part of enemy body? Enemy body is [(3, 1)]. Safe.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (x=8, y=3):**\n    *   Coordinate: (8, 3).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n*   **DOWN (x=7, y=2):**\n    *   Coordinate: (7, 2).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: **Yes.** (7, 2) is my current body segment (the tail). Moving down returns to the previous head position. Moving backwards into your own body is fatal.\n    *   **Result: DEADLY (Self-collision).**\n\n*   **UP (x=7, y=4):**\n    *   Coordinate: (7, 4).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** Yes, (7, 4) is NOT an apple (Apples are at (4,6), (8,6)... (6,6)... (0,3)... (6,0)). Wait, checking the list: (4,6), (8,6), (4,4), (6,6), (1,7), (0,4), (9,3), (1,2), (5,7), (7,0), (2,5), (2,7), (0,3), (6,0), (6,8).\n    *   (7, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation (Ranking Safe Moves):**\n\n*   **Option 1: LEFT (to 6, 3)**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   **Escape:** Moves away from the right edge (9,9). Being near the edge limits escape routes.\n        *   **Apple Access:** Moves closer to the left-side apple cluster. (6,3) is adjacent to (6,0) (vertical distance 3) and (4,4) (distance |2| + |1|).\n        *   **Safety:** Keeps a safe distance from Enemy #1 (currently at 3,2).\n    *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n\n*   **Option 2: UP (to 7, 4)**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   **Space:** Moves into a relatively open area (row 4).\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   **Direction:** Moves further up towards the top wall (y=9). If I get pinned against the top wall, my horizontal movement options decrease.\n        *   **Positioning:** (7,4) is isolated. The nearest apples are (6,0) (distance 5) or (8,6) (distance 4). It's a \"middle of nowhere\" position.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT (to 8, 3)**\n    *   **Pros:**\n        *   **Apple:** (9, 3) is an apple. Moving to (8,3) positions me to eat it next turn (provided the enemy doesn't snatch it).\n    *   **Cons:**\n        *   **Dead End Risk:** Moving to the right edge is generally riskier. If the enemy cuts off the interior, I might be trapped against the wall (9,9).\n        *   **Enemy Pressure:** The enemy (3,2) is on the left. If I go right, I am moving away from the enemy, which is usually safe, but I might be ceding control of the center.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction:**\n- Enemy #1 is at (3,2). They are likely looking at apples at (2,5), (4,4), or (4,6).\n- They are on the left side.\n- If I move LEFT to (6,3), I am moving toward the center/left, potentially contesting these apples.\n- If I move RIGHT or UP, I am conceding the left side apples to the enemy.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy:**\nTo win, I need to eat more apples than the enemy. Letting the enemy dominate the left side while I wander the right edge is a losing strategy. I need to control the board center and left side where the apple density is higher. Moving left establishes presence in the central column (x=6) and allows access to the vertical strip of apples at (6,0), (6,6), (6,8).\n\n**Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the best move. It avoids the immediate death of moving DOWN, avoids the potential trapping of moving RIGHT/UP towards the wall, and actively moves toward the valuable apple cluster on the left side of the board. It keeps my options open to move down towards (6,0) or navigate towards the center apples next turn.\n\nLEFT",

On the next turn I can take that apple safely and grow. Keeps multiple follow-up options (left/up/right) and stays away from the enemy.\n- UP (3,3): Keeps central position and options, but delays grabbing the very close apple and doesn't gain immediate points.\n- RIGHT (4,2): Moves toward contested right-side area and closer to the enemy; less attractive given the nearby low-risk apple at (1,2).\n\nDecision and short plan:\n- Take the quick, safe apple route: move LEFT to (2,2). Next turn go LEFT to (1,2) to eat the apple and grow.

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 2). They are currently in a corner-like area (near x=0, y=0).\n*   **Enemy Options:** They are likely to move DOWN (towards (2,1) or (2,0)) or LEFT (towards (1,2) or (0,2)) to chase apples at (1,2), (0,3), (0,4), (7,0), etc. They might also move RIGHT (towards (3,2)) but that is their body (unless their tail moved last turn).\n*   **My Position:** I am at (6, 3).\n    *   **Option LEFT (5,3):** Moves toward the center/left. The apple at (4,4) is nearby (distance 2). The apple at (2,5) is further but accessible. This keeps me away from the bottom edge.\n    *   **Option DOWN (6,2):** Moves toward the bottom edge and the apple at (6,0). This is a direct line to an apple. However, moving down puts me closer to the bottom wall (y=0) and potentially closer to the enemy if they move down. The bottom area is tighter than the center.\n    *   **Option UP (6,4):** Moves toward the center. The apple at (6,6) is visible. This seems like the safest horizontal move, keeping me in the open center.\n\n**4. Risk Assessment:**\n*   **RIGHT** is death (backwards).\n*   **DOWN (6,2):** Safe for now, but leads to a tight space (bottom row). If the enemy is also down there, it could be dangerous.\n*   **LEFT (5,3):** Safe. Opens up paths to (4,4) and (2,5).\n*   **UP (6,4):** Safe. Opens up paths to (6,6) and (8,6).\n\n**Decision:**\nI am currently at (6,3). The enemy is at (2,2). The enemy is very far away and likely heading towards the bottom/left corner.\nMoving **UP** to (6,4) keeps me in the open central area. It avoids the potential congestion of the bottom row and the tight corner on the left. From (6,4), I have access to (6,6), (8,6), and (4,4). This maximizes my future options and keeps me away from the enemy's likely path.\n\nUP",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy snake is at (1, 2). They are still in the corner-like area.\n*   **Enemy Options:** They are likely to move DOWN (towards (1,1) or (1,0)) or LEFT (towards (0,2)) or UP (towards (1,3)). They seem to be hunting the cluster of apples at (0,3), (0,4), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7).\n*   **My Position:** I am at (6, 4).\n    *   **Option LEFT (5,4):** Moves toward the center. The apple at (4,4) is directly adjacent. This is a very tempting move as it guarantees an apple if it's still there (it is). From (5,4), I can access (4,4), (4,6), (5,7).\n    *   **Option RIGHT (7,4):** Moves away from the dense apple cluster. This leads towards the right edge. The nearest apple is at (7,0) or (8,6), which are quite far. This is less optimal.\n    *   **Option UP (6,5):** Moves toward the top. The apple at (6,6) is reachable. However, I am currently at y=4. Moving UP to (6,5) puts me further from the apple at (4,4) (which is also at y=4).\n\n**4. Risk Assessment:**\n*   **DOWN** is death (backwards).\n*   **RIGHT (7,4):** Safe but leads to a sparse area with apples far away. I should avoid this unless necessary.\n*   **UP (6,5):** Safe, but leaves the apple at (4,4) behind me. If I go UP, the enemy (currently at (1,2)) might go UP to (1,3) and eventually head towards (2,5) or (4,4). If I go UP, I lose access to (4,4) for several turns.\n*   **LEFT (5,4):** Safe. **Crucially, this moves me directly adjacent to the apple at (4,4).** This is the closest apple to me. Eating an apple grows my body, which is essential for survival and score.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am at (6,4). The apple at (4,4) is at distance 2 to the left. Moving LEFT to (5,4) gets me adjacent to it. The enemy is at (1,2), far away and likely moving towards the left/bottom side of the board. They are not an immediate threat to (5,4) or (4,4). Taking the apple is the priority to close the score gap (Enemy: 2, Me: 1).\n\nLEFT",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n\nThe enemy snake is at (1, 3). They are still in the bottom-left corner area.\n*   **Enemy Options:** They are likely to move RIGHT (towards (2, 3)), DOWN (towards (1, 2) - risky if body is there, wait, body is at (1, 2) - so DOWN is death for them), or UP (towards (1, 4)). If they move DOWN into (1, 2), they die because their body is there. If they move RIGHT into (2, 2), they die because their body is there. Their only safe moves appear to be UP or LEFT. If they move UP to (1, 4), they might chase apples like (1, 7) or (2, 7).\n*   **My Position:** I am at (5, 4).\n    *   **Option LEFT (4,4):** This moves me directly onto an apple. Eating an apple grows my body, which is essential for survival and score. It also keeps me in the center, maintaining access to other apples like (4,6), (5,7), and (2,5).\n    *   **Option DOWN (5,3):** This moves me into an empty cell. The apple at (0, 3) is further down. This isolates me slightly from the apple cluster at y=4-8.\n    *   **Option UP (5,5):** This moves me into an empty cell. I would be moving away from the apple at (4,4), which is directly to my left. From (5,5), the apple at (6,6) is two steps away. (4,6) is two steps away (Left, Up).\n    *   **Option RIGHT (6,4):** Death.\n\n**4. Risk Assessment:**\n*   **RIGHT** is death (backwards).\n*   **DOWN (5,3) / UP (5,5):** Safe moves, but they involve skipping the immediate apple at (4,4). Skipping food is generally disadvantageous in Snake, especially when trailing in score (Enemy: 2, Me: 1).\n*   **LEFT (4,4):** Safe. **Crucially, this is the only move that allows me to eat an apple this turn.** Eating now closes the score gap and extends my length. The position (4,4) is central and offers good mobility for future turns (access to (4,6), (5,7), (2,5), (2,7)). The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat to (4,4).\n\n**Decision:**\nI am at (5, 4). The apple at (4, 4) is to my left. The enemy is at (1, 3), far away and likely constrained by their own body. Eating the apple at (4, 4) is the optimal move to gain points and maintain a strong position on the board.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy head at (5,4) is far and cannot reach any of these squares in one move, so no risk of immediate head-on collision.\n- LEFT moves onto an apple (0,3). That means I will grow this turn (tail will not move), increasing my length to 4. UP or RIGHT do not pick apples, so the tail would move and length would stay 3.\n- Growing by taking the apple at (0,3) is not immediately dangerous: it places my head on x=0 with free space above (0,4) which also has an apple. After LEFT, my body would be [(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)], and I would have the opportunity to take the (0,4) apple next turn if safe.\n\nFuture planning and tradeoffs:\n- UP preserves maximum immediate mobility (no growth), but misses two nearby apples on the left column.\n- RIGHT is neutral but doesn't contest apples and doesn't improve my position relative to the left cluster.\n- LEFT wins an apple now and sets up a high-value follow-up at (0,4). The left column has a cluster of reachable apples (0,3 then 0,4 then moves toward 1,7/2,7), and the enemy is currently focused farther right, so I can safely harvest the left cluster while keeping escape options up the board. I must be mindful that growing reduces tail movement and restricts one-step reversals, so after grabbing apples I will prioritize routes that keep multiple exits.\n\nDecision: take the apple now and move LEFT to begin harvesting the left-side cluster.\n\nLEFT",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 3). They are in the bottom-left corner.\n*   **Enemy Options:**\n    *   They cannot move RIGHT into (1, 3) (body).\n    *   They cannot move DOWN into (0, 2) (empty, but likely trapped).\n    *   They can move UP into (0, 4). This moves them towards the apple at (0, 4) (which is also an apple).\n    *   They can move LEFT (off board) -> Death.\n    *   **Prediction:** The enemy will likely move UP to (0, 4) to eat the apple and avoid death. If they do, they will survive and grow.\n*   **My Position (4, 4):**\n    *   **Option LEFT (3,4):** Empty space. Keeps me central. Safe.\n    *   **Option DOWN (4,3):** Empty space. Moves me away from the apple cluster at y=4-8.\n    *   **Option UP (4,5):** Empty space. Moves me closer to the apple at (4,6). This is a good position to attack the apple cluster.\n    *   **Option RIGHT (5,4):** Death.\n\n**4. Risk Assessment:**\n*   **RIGHT** is death.\n*   **LEFT, DOWN, UP** are all safe regarding immediate collision.\n*   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is likely moving UP. If they go to (0, 4), they are safe. If I move LEFT to (3, 4), I am safe. If I move UP to (4, 5), I am safe.\n*   **Apple Access:** I have no apples immediately adjacent (except the one I just passed or the enemy might take).\n    *   (4,6) is 1 step UP from (4,5).\n    *   (2,5) is 2 steps LEFT+UP from (4,4).\n    *   (5,7) is 3 steps RIGHT+UP+UP.\n    *   (6,6) is 2 steps RIGHT+UP.\n*   **Decision:** I need to approach the apple cluster. Moving UP to (4, 5) positions me directly below (4, 6), which is the closest apple (excluding the one at (0, 4) which is contested by the enemy). Moving LEFT to (3, 4) is fine but doesn't immediately set me up for the next apple as well as UP does. Moving DOWN to (4, 3) moves me away from the main food source.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP to (4, 5) is the optimal move. It positions my head to capture the apple at (4, 6) next turn (if safe) and keeps me in the center of the board with access to multiple other apples. It also keeps me safely away from the enemy's likely path.\n\nUP",

Wait, looking at the prompt: \"Board state\" shows a \"T\" at (6,4) in row 4. This confirms my tail is at (6,4). My body is [(4,4), (5,4)]. The previous turn's board showed \"0\" at (4,4).\n    *   Apples: 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (0, 4) (Moved UP from (0, 3) as predicted).\n    *   Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2)]. They likely ate the apple at (0, 4) (which is not listed in the apple list, but the board shows no apple there now).\n    *   Apples: 4 (Unchanged, likely didn't eat this turn or the board didn't update the score yet? The prompt says \"Snake #1 apples: 4\" for the previous turn. If they just moved to (0,4), they might have eaten, but the score hasn't updated in the \"Scores so far\" block yet. I will assume they are growing).\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   The apples listed in the prompt are: (4, 6), (8, 6), (6, 6), (1, 7), (9, 3), (5, 7), (7, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (6, 0), (6, 8), (5, 8), (1, 6), (1, 4), (8, 0).\n    *   The board visualization matches this list (ignoring the '0', 'T', '1' markers).\n    *   My head is at (4, 5).\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis (Check 4 Directions from Head (4, 5)):**\n\n*   **LEFT (x=3, y=5):**\n    *   Coordinate: (3, 5).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No (Enemy is at (0, 4)).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT (x=5, y=5):**\n    *   Coordinate: (5, 5).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No (My body is at (4,4) and (5,4)).\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN (x=4, y=4):**\n    *   Coordinate: (4, 4).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: **Yes.** This is my previous head position, now part of my body.\n    *   **Result: DEADLY.**\n*   **UP (x=4, y=6):**\n    *   Coordinate: (4, 6).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** Yes, there is an apple at (4, 6).\n    *   **Result: SAFE and REWARDING (Eats Apple).**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Status:** The enemy is at (0, 4). They are in the corner.\n    *   They cannot move LEFT (off board).\n    *   They cannot move DOWN (into their own body at (0, 3)).\n    *   They can move RIGHT into (1, 4). This is currently empty.\n    *   They can move UP into (0, 5). This is currently empty.\n    *   **Prediction:** They are cornered. They will likely move UP or RIGHT. Moving UP brings them closer to the apple cluster at (1, 6) and (1, 7). Moving RIGHT brings them to the center. They might try to block me or go for food. I need to assume they will survive.\n\n**4. Risk Assessment & Decision:**\n*   **UP to (4, 6):** This is an apple. Eating it grows my body. My tail will stay at (6,4) instead of moving. The new body will be [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]? No, wait. If I eat, I grow. My current body is [(4,4), (5,4)].\n    *   If I move UP to (4,6) and eat:\n        *   Old Head (4,5) becomes body.\n        *   Old Body (4,4) becomes body.\n        *   Old Body (5,4) stays body.\n        *   Tail does not move.\n        *   New Body: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)].\n    *   This is a very safe move. (4,6) is currently empty.\n    *   It puts me directly next to other apples: (6,6) is 2 steps away (Right, Right). (5,7) is 3 steps away. (6,8) is far. (4,6) is the closest apple to my current position.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe, but empty. Moves me away from the immediate apple at (4,6).\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe, but empty. Moves me closer to (6,6) and (5,7), but (4,6) is closer and directly in front of me.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP is the clear winner. It secures a point immediately, grows my snake (increasing survivability), and positions me perfectly for the next moves towards the cluster of apples in the upper right. The risk is low as the cell is empty and the enemy is far away.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (4,6) this turn. Next turn, I will likely be at (4,6) with a longer body. I will look to move towards the apple at (6,6) or (5,7). I must keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement to ensure they don't cut me off. Since I am growing, I have more body to work with, which can be used to block the enemy if necessary, but for now, focus on eating.\n\nUP",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   The enemy is at (1, 4). Their potential moves:\n        *   LEFT: (0, 4) (Occupied by their own body, effectively the tail if moving, but risky). Actually, if they move LEFT to (0,4), that cell is part of their body. Since they are length 5+, moving into (0,4) hits their own body at (0,3) behind them? No, if they move LEFT, their new head is (0,4). The body follows. The old head (1,4) becomes body. The old tail moves. The cell (0,4) is currently their body, but as they move, it becomes head. Wait, \"If you move into any snake's body... you die\". If they move Left, they enter (0,4). (0,4) is currently their body. They die. **LEFT is fatal for them.**\n        *   RIGHT: (2, 4). Empty. Safe.\n        *   UP: (1, 5). Empty? The board shows a 'T' at (2, 2) and dots elsewhere in row 1. (1, 5) appears empty. Safe.\n        *   DOWN: (1, 3). Occupied by their own body. Fatal.\n    *   **Prediction:** Enemy will move RIGHT (2, 4) or UP (1, 5). Moving UP puts them closer to the apple at (2, 5) and (1, 6). Moving RIGHT opens up the center.\n*   **Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (4, 7):** This is an apple. Eating it grows my body. My tail will stay at (5, 4). The new body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. This move is directly towards an apple and keeps my vertical positioning. It also keeps me directly in line with the potential path towards the cluster (6,6), (6,8), etc. It's a guaranteed point.\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe, but empty. Moves me adjacent to the apple at (6, 6). However, (5, 6) is also adjacent to the apple at (5, 7). This gives me a branching path next turn. If I go UP now to (4, 7), I can still access (6, 6) or (6, 8) later, but (5, 6) is slightly more central.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe, but moves away from the densest cluster of apples in the upper right.\n    *   **DOWN:** Death.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (4, 7) is the optimal choice. It secures an immediate point (Apple #5), growing my snake and solidifying my lead. While (5, 6) offers flexibility, (4, 7) is a guaranteed reward that keeps me aligned with the vertical structure of the board. The enemy is far enough away that they cannot intercept this move, and moving UP keeps my options open for the subsequent turns to target (6, 6) or (6, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (4, 7) this turn. Next turn, I will be at (4, 7) with a length of 5. I will look to move RIGHT towards the cluster at (6, 6) or UP towards (6, 8). I need to monitor the enemy's movement to (2, 4) or (1, 5) to ensure they don't flank me, but my vertical position gives me good board control.\n\nUP",

Current State Review:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (4, 7). I successfully moved UP and ate the apple at (4, 7).\n    *   **Body:** [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. The tail is at (5, 4). Because I ate, the tail did not move forward this turn, meaning (5, 4) remains the tail.\n    *   **Apples:** 5.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (2, 4). Based on the board state and analysis, they likely moved RIGHT from (1, 4). This confirms my prediction that they avoided moving into their own body (Left) or the wall (Down).\n    *   **Body:** [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)]. They have not grown (no apple at (2, 4)).\n    *   **Apples:** 5. (They have not scored this turn).\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   The apple at (4, 7) is gone (eaten by me).\n    *   Relevant nearby apples: (6, 6), (5, 7), (2, 5), (2, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (1, 6).\n\n**2.

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   The enemy is at (2, 4).\n    *   **Threat Assessment:** The enemy is potentially in a position to intercept my path. If I move UP to (4, 8), the enemy could move UP to (2, 5) or (1, 5), getting closer to the apple cluster at (5, 8) and (6, 8). However, the most immediate threat is head-on collision.\n    *   **Prediction:**\n        *   The enemy is looking for apples. The apples at (2, 5) and (1, 6) are close to them.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP to (2, 5), they will be two cells away from my potential path if I go RIGHT.\n        *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 4), they are safely navigating the board.\n        *   *Critical Observation:* If I choose UP to (4, 8), I am moving directly towards the enemy's potential path if they go UP. If the enemy chooses UP to (2, 5) and I choose UP to (4, 8), we do not collide (we are in different columns).\n    *   However, looking at the board, (5, 7) is an **apple**. Eating apples is the primary objective. (4, 8) is empty.\n*   **Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** This is an apple. Eating it grows my body. My tail will stay at (5, 4). The new body will be [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. This move puts me directly adjacent to the apple at (6, 6) and (5, 8) next turn. It also places me in a central column (5) which is very flexible.\n    *   **UP to (4, 8):** Safe, but empty. Moves me closer to the cluster (5, 8), (6, 8). However, it forces me into column 4, which is currently a vertical line of my own body. If I get stuck in column 4, I have limited maneuverability. Moving RIGHT breaks this vertical lock and puts me in a more open area.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe, but empty. Moves me away from the densest cluster of apples. Not optimal.\n    *   **DOWN:** Death.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 7) is the optimal choice. It secures an immediate point (Apple #5), growing my snake and tying me with the enemy at 5 apples (assuming they haven't eaten). This move is superior to UP because:\n1.  **Reward:** It eats an apple (RIGHT) vs. nothing (UP).\n2.  **Positioning:** It moves me out of the vertical \"tunnel\" I am currently in (column 4) and into a more open area (column 5), allowing for future flexibility to target (6, 6), (6, 8), or (5, 8).\n3.  **Safety:** The enemy is at (2, 4). Even if they move UP to (2, 5) or (1, 5), they cannot reach me this turn or next turn in a way that causes a head-on collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 7) this turn. Next turn, I will be at (5, 7) with a length of 6. From there, I can immediately target the apple at (6, 6) (LEFT/DOWN?), wait, (6, 6) is at x=6, y=6. From (5, 7), I can move RIGHT to (6, 7) or DOWN to (5, 6). I need to watch the enemy's movement towards the upper cluster (5, 8), (6, 8) to see if I should race them or flank them.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I successfully moved RIGHT, ate the apple at (5, 7), and grew.\n    *   **Body:** [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. My tail remains at (5, 4) because I ate.\n    *   **Apples:** 6. (Tied with Enemy).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (2, 5). Based on the board state and my previous analysis, they likely moved UP from (2, 4) to eat the apple at (2, 5).\n    *   **Body:** [(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)]. They grew this turn.\n    *   **Apples:** 6. (They also ate).\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   Apples at (5, 7) and (2, 5) are gone.\n    *   **Nearby Apples:**\n        *   **Cluster 1 (Right/Top):** (6, 6), (6, 8), (5, 8), (6, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0). Distant.\n        *   **Cluster 2 (Left/Top):** (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6). Close to Enemy.\n        *   **Cluster 3 (Left/Mid):** (4, 3). Close to my tail route.\n        *   **Cluster 4 (Bottom):** (7, 5), (8, 4), (9, 6), (9, 3). Below me.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis (Check 4 Directions from Head (5, 7)):**\n\n*   **UP (x=5, y=8):**\n    *   Coordinate: (5, 8).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No (My body is in x=4 and y=4-7).\n    *   Enemy Collision: No. Enemy is at x=2.\n    *   **Apple Check:** **YES.** There is an apple at (5, 8).\n    *   **Result: SAFE and REWARDING (Eats Apple).**\n*   **DOWN (x=5, y=6):**\n    *   Coordinate: (5, 6).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No (Apple at (6, 6)).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT (x=4, y=7):**\n    *   Coordinate: (4, 7).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   **Self Collision: DEADLY.** This is my previous head position and currently my body (index 0). Moving backwards is suicide.\n    *   **Result: DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT (x=6, y=7):**\n    *   Coordinate: (6, 7).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No (Apple at (6, 6) is down-right, (6, 8) is up-right).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **The Critical Threat:**\n    The most dangerous move the enemy can make is moving **RIGHT** to (3, 5).\n    *   If I move **UP** to (5, 8), the enemy at (2, 5) moving RIGHT to (3, 5) results in no collision. We remain separated.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 7), the enemy moving RIGHT to (3, 5) results in no collision.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (5, 6), the enemy moving RIGHT to (3, 5) results in no collision.\n    *   **However**, if the enemy moves **UP** to (2, 6) or **DOWN** to (2, 4), they threaten the apples at (2, 7) or (1, 6) respectively. Neither of these moves threatens my head at (5, 7).\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **UP to (5, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Eats an apple immediately. Increases score to 7, taking the lead. Moves me to the top of the board, securing a safe zone. Opens access to (6, 8) next turn.\n        *   **Cons:** None immediately visible. It's a vertical movement into open space.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves towards (6, 6) and (6, 8). Opens up the right side of the board.\n        *   **Cons:** Does not eat an apple immediately. The enemy might eat the apple at (2, 7) or (1, 6) if I delay.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves towards (6, 6).\n        *   **Cons:** Does not eat an apple immediately. It is a lateral move, keeping me in the \"danger zone\" where the enemy's expansion could eventually overlap.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI must secure points. The apple at (5, 8) is available and safe. Moving **UP** puts me at 7 apples, maintaining my tie-breaker advantage and positioning me securely at the top of the map. The enemy is currently blocked from reaching this cluster by the distance and my potential position. Moving DOWN or RIGHT leaves the apple at (5, 8) available for a future turn, but risks the enemy intercepting other apples or me getting trapped. Given the safety of the UP move and the immediate reward, **UP** is the optimal play.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 8) to take the lead. From (5, 8), look to secure (6, 8) next, then sweep down to (6, 6) and (7, 5). Maintain distance from the enemy who is likely hunting the (1,6)/(2,7) cluster.\n\nUP",

They cannot reach (2,6) or (2,7) this turn, so there is no head-on collision threat if I move UP.\n- None of my own body or the enemy body occupy (2,6). Moving UP is safe this turn.\n- If I move UP and do not eat this turn, my tail (1,2) will vacate and I will retain good mobility. If I follow with UP again I can eat the apple at (2,7) and grow.\n\nTactical assessment and short-term plan:\n- Take the apple cluster on the left/top (targets: (2,7), (1,6), (1,7)). Moving UP keeps multiple follow-up options: UP again to eat (2,7), or left to (1,6) if the enemy shifts.\n- Avoid getting pinned on x=0; keep the option to move right if the enemy cuts off the left side.\n- Stay out of the vertical column x=4 where the enemy\u2019s body sits to limit head-on or trap risk.\n\nMove: UP",

(I am now in the lead).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (3, 6). Based on the board state and my previous analysis, they likely moved RIGHT from (2, 5) to (3, 6).\n    *   **Body:** [(2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)]. The apple at (2, 5) remains on the board (it wasn't eaten by me), so the snake did not grow this turn (unless they ate a different apple not visible in the map update, but the board shows the apple at (2,5) persists).

This is strange behavior for an opponent, but it is the reality.\n    *   **Apples:** 6.\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   **My Safety:** I am at (5, 8). My body is in x=4 and y=4-7, and (5, 7).

Immediate Threat Analysis (Check 4 Directions from Head (5, 8)):**\n*   **UP (x=5, y=9):**\n    *   Coordinate: (5, 9).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No (Body is at x=4 or y<=7).\n    *   Enemy Collision: No (Enemy is at x=3).\n    *   **Apple Check:** No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN (x=5, y=7):**\n    *   Coordinate: (5, 7).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   **Self Collision: DEADLY.** This is my previous head position and currently my body (index 0).\n    *   **Result: DEADLY.**\n*   **LEFT (x=4, y=8):**\n    *   Coordinate: (4, 8).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No (My body is at y=4-7).\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT (x=6, y=8):**\n    *   Coordinate: (6, 8).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** **YES.** There is an apple at (6, 8).\n    *   **Result: SAFE and REWARDING (Eats Apple).**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Behavior:** The enemy at (3, 6) is adjacent to the apple at (2, 5) but chose to move to (3, 6). They are likely aiming for the cluster at (2, 7), (1, 7), or (1, 6). If they move UP to (3, 7) or LEFT to (2, 6), they threaten those areas.\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Eats an apple immediately. Increases score to 8, extending my lead. Moves me towards the dense cluster of apples on the right side of the board [(7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 6)].\n        *   **Cons:** None immediately visible.\n    *   **UP to (5, 9):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe move. Positioning at the top edge.\n        *   **Cons:** Misses the immediate apple at (6, 8). If I go UP, I might have to backtrack to get (6, 8), allowing the enemy time to move around.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe move.\n        *   **Cons:** Misses the apple. Moves me closer to the enemy's potential path, but doesn't gain points.\n    *   **DOWN:** Dead.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI have a safe opportunity to eat an apple immediately at (6, 8). This extends my lead to 8-6. From (6, 8), I am perfectly positioned to move to (7, 5), (8, 4), or (9, 6) next turn. The enemy is far away and seems confused or deliberately avoiding the apple at (2, 5), which is to my benefit. Taking the apple is the highest value move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat (6, 8) to extend the lead to 8-6. From there, move towards the cluster at (7, 5) or (9, 6). The enemy is currently at (3, 6) and poses no immediate threat to the right side of the board. I will continue to dominate the right side.\n\nRIGHT",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Behavior:** The enemy at (2, 8) is close to the apples at (2, 9) [doesn't exist], (1, 7), and (1, 6). They are likely targeting the left-side apples or trying to cut me off, though they are currently quite far. They cannot reach me this turn.\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward the apple cluster at (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 6). From (7, 8), I can easily reach these in subsequent turns.\n        *   **Cons:** None immediately visible.\n    *   **UP to (6, 9):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe. Hugs the top wall.\n        *   **Cons:** Limited options from the top wall. (8, 9) is an apple, but (6, 9) to (8, 9) is a longer path than going RIGHT. It puts me in a corner-like position.\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe. Moves back towards the center.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves away from the dense apple cluster on the top-right. Not optimal for scoring.\n    *   **LEFT:** Dead.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nRIGHT is the optimal move. It keeps me moving towards the dense apple cluster (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 6) while maintaining safety. From (7, 8), I can turn DOWN towards (7, 5) or RIGHT towards (8, 6) next turn. UP to (6, 9) isolates me at the top edge, which is risky if the enemy decides to come up or if I need to escape later. Moving DOWN is a waste of momentum.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMaintain momentum towards the right-side apple cluster. From (7, 8), I will likely move DOWN towards (7, 5) or (8, 4) next turn to start collecting those apples. Keep the enemy in the corner on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

From (1,7) I will have options to go down to (1,6), up to (1,8), or left toward x=0; I must avoid moving back into (2,7) immediately because it will still be part of my body right after growth.\n- The enemy is clustered around x=4 and unlikely to contest the small apple cluster at x=1; taking these apples increases my score and map control without immediate risk of head-on.\n- After collecting the two leftmost apples, I will reassess mobility to avoid getting trapped along the left wall, keeping an escape route toward open space to my right if the enemy advances.\n\nDecision: take the apple at (1,7) now.\n\nLEFT",

Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   **Enemy Behavior:** The enemy moved DOWN to (1, 7). They are circling the bottom-left area. They are not an immediate threat to me. They are likely hunting the apple at (0, 1) or (1, 6).\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves directly toward the dense apple cluster at (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 4).

Going UP restricts my vertical movement later.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 7):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves away from the dense apple cluster. I want to press into the right side where the apples are clustered.\n    *   **LEFT:** Dead.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nRIGHT is the optimal move. It positions me at (8, 8), putting me adjacent to (9, 6) and (8, 6). This maximizes my ability to collect multiple apples in the right sector quickly. From (8, 8), I have excellent mobility to reach (8, 6) or (9, 6) in the next turn. Moving UP to (7, 9) traps me against the top wall and delays reaching the high-density apple zone.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAdvance into the right-sector apple cluster. From (8, 8), move DOWN towards (8, 6) or RIGHT towards (9, 8) depending on the next turn's board state. Continue to outpace the enemy by securing the dense food sources.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State Review:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (8, 8) \u2014 I moved RIGHT from (7, 8).\n    *   **Body:** [(7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5)]. Tail is at (4, 5).\n    *   **Apples:** 7.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (1, 7). Based on the board state, the enemy stayed or moved into (1, 7). Looking at the board state provided, I see '1' at (1, 6) in the visual, but the text says Head is (1, 6). Wait, the text summary says: \"Head: (1, 6)\".\n    *   *Correction based on Text Description:* The text description lists Enemy Head as (1, 6). The board visualization shows '1' at (1, 6) (row 6, column 1). This implies the enemy moved UP from (1, 5) or (0, 6) or stayed. Actually, looking at the previous turn, the enemy was at (1, 7). If the enemy is now at (1, 6), they moved DOWN. Wait, the text says \"Head: (1, 6)\". The board shows \"1\" at coordinates (1, 6).\n    *   **Body:** [(1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)].\n    *   **Apples:** 9.\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   **My Safety:** I am at (8, 8). My body is mostly at x=4 or x=5,6,7. The cell behind me (7, 8) is occupied by my own body.\n    *   **Nearby Apples:**\n        *   (8, 6) \u2014 Down 2.\n        *   (9, 6) \u2014 Down 2, Right 1.\n        *   (8, 4) \u2014 Down 4.\n        *   (7, 5) \u2014 Left 1, Down 3.\n        *   (9, 9) \u2014 Right 1, Up 1.\n    *   **Enemy Location:** Head at (1, 6), Body at (1, 7) and others. They are far away.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis (Check 4 Directions from Head (8, 8)):**\n*   **UP (x=8, y=9):**\n    *   Coordinate: (8, 9).\n    *   Board Check: Yes (Top edge).\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** Yes! (8, 9) is an apple.\n    *   **Result: SAFE & REWARDING.**\n*   **DOWN (x=8, y=7):**\n    *   Coordinate: (8, 7).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No (Body is at x<=7).\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT (x=7, y=8):**\n    *   Coordinate: (7, 8).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   **Self Collision: DEADLY.** This is my previous head position (index 0).\n    *   **Result: DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT (x=9, y=8):**\n    *   Coordinate: (9, 8).\n    *   Board Check: Yes.\n    *   Self Collision: No.\n    *   Enemy Collision: No.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **UP to (8, 9):**\n        *   **Pros:** Immediate apple gain (+1 score). Moves to the top-right corner, securing a safe spot. From (8, 9), I can later move LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8). (7, 9) is also empty.\n        *   **Cons:** Cornering myself slightly, but the top edge is generally safe if I don't get trapped. The apple at (9, 9) is reachable next.\n    *   **DOWN to (8, 7):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward the cluster at (8, 6), (9, 6), (8, 4).\n        *   **Cons:** No immediate score. (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   **RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Hugs the right wall.\n        *   **Cons:** No immediate score. (9, 8) is empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** Dead.\n\n*   **Decision:** The apple at (8, 9) is the safest and most rewarding immediate move. It forces the enemy to deal with me occupying the top row. The top row is large enough to maneuver. From (8, 9), I can access (9, 9) or go down to (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6). This opens up the entire right side.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nTake the apple at (8, 9). From there, survey the board for the next move. Likely moving to (9, 9) or dropping down to (8, 8) to chase the (9, 6) / (8, 6) apples. Maintain dominance of the right side.\n\nUP",

Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT to (9, 9):**\n        *   **Pros:** Immediate apple gain (+1 score). Secures the corner (9, 9). From there, I can move DOWN to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 9) (which will be empty by then). This positions me well for the cluster at (9, 6) and (8, 6).\n        *   **Cons:** None immediate. Corner is safe if I don't get trapped.\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 9):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward (7, 5) and (8, 4).\n        *   **Cons:** No immediate score. (9, 9) is better because it's an apple and a corner.\n    *   **DOWN:** Dead.\n    *   **UP:** Dead.\n\n*   **Decision:** RIGHT is the clear winner. It gains an apple, secures the corner, and sets up the next moves toward the bottom-right cluster.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nTake the apple at (9, 9). Next turn, move DOWN to (9, 8) to prepare to eat the apple at (9, 6). After that, I will likely move to (8, 6) or (9, 5) depending on the enemy's position. I need to ensure I don't get stuck in the corner, but the right side is currently clear.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

From (1,5) every adjacent cell (1,6),(2,5),(1,4) will still be occupied by my body, leaving me with no legal moves on the next turn.

Wait, looking at my body list: `[(9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)...]`. The tail is at (5, 7). (8, 8) is the third segment.

I must take it to survive. My body will follow, eventually clearing up the space to my left.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (9, 7). Next turn, I will likely be able to move DOWN to (9, 6) to eat the apple. I must ensure that when I move down, I don't trap myself against my own body if the path closes. However, since I am moving away from my tail, the space behind me will eventually free up. My goal is to secure the apples on the right side of the board while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

They cannot move left (occupied by their own body) or up (into their neck) or right (off board). That means no immediate head-on collision threat from the enemy into my vicinity this turn.\n- Moving UP to (0,9) is legal but very constraining: from (0,9) my only non-suicidal follow-up is RIGHT to (1,9) (UP and LEFT would be off-board, DOWN would be back into neck). That effectively forces me to march along the top row with fewer immediate options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,8) is also legal and keeps more follow-up flexibility (I can go RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) next turn). After moving RIGHT I still cannot go DOWN (1,7) because that cell remains part of my body this turn, but I preserve two forward choices rather than one.\n- I won't eat an apple this turn either way, so my tail will move forward and free (1,4) next turn; however cells like (1,7) and (2,7) will remain part of my body for a few turns, so I must avoid trying to drop into them immediately.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Take RIGHT to start shifting toward the center/top area, keeping options open to either go up along the top row or continue east across row 8/9 as openings appear. Watch the enemy as they move down; avoid entering the clustered right-side region while the enemy is nearby. Use the extra maneuverability from (1,8) to pick a safe corridor to collect nearby low-risk apples later (sweep east/west from the top rather than plunging into my own body corridors).\n\nRIGHT",

Moves me inward.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves me away from the immediate apple at (9, 6). It also places my head closer to my own body structure on the left (at (8,8) and (8,9)), which might limit future movement if I'm not careful. Given the apple is right there, DOWN is the superior choice for score gain and positioning.\n    *   **UP/RIGHT:** Dead.\n\n*   **Decision:** DOWN is the best move. It scores a point and positions me well.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (9, 6) to eat the apple. From there, I should continue downwards towards (9, 3) or look to clear the bottom row (7,0), (8,0), (6,0) if safe. I must watch the enemy snake, which is currently distant but growing faster (9 apples to my 7). I need to play efficiently to catch up.\n\nDOWN",

That gives some lateral room (0,9 and 2,9) but risks pushing me onto the board edge and can constrict options if I keep moving up/along the edge.\n- RIGHT (to 2,8) keeps me toward the center, preserves two good follow-up options (3,8 and 2,9), and positions me to access apples in the middle/right of the board without immediately boxing myself in with my own body on the left.\n- The enemy head is at (9,7) with neck at (9,8). They can go left to (8,7) or down to (9,6) (there is an apple at 9,6). Neither threatens me this turn or next turn given the distance.\n- Moving RIGHT advances me toward more open space and closer to reachable apples while avoiding the top-edge confinement that UP would create.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move east along row 8 to gain access to the central apple cluster, then drop down into the middle (y around 4\u20136) to collect apples like (6,6), (8,6), and (6,3) while avoiding collisions with the enemy on the far right.\n- Avoid getting trapped by my own left-side body; keep lateral mobility and prefer paths that maintain at least two safe follow-up moves.\n- Watch the enemy for any aggressive push leftwards; if they head toward center, yield room and avoid head-on confrontations.\n\nRIGHT",

My tail (5, 8) has likely moved, leaving (5, 8) empty or shifting the body.\n    *   **Body:** [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]. I am now length 9.\n    *   **Apples:** 8.\n    *   **Position:** Right edge, at y=6.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (2, 8).\n    *   **Body:** [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]. Length 10.\n    *   **Apples:** 9.\n    *   **Analysis:** The enemy is on the left side, looking busy but potentially trapped by the board edge or its own body. It is slightly ahead in score (9 vs 8).\n*   **Board & Apples:**\n    *   **Key Apples:** (8, 6) is immediately to my LEFT. (7, 0), (8, 0), (6, 0) are at the bottom right.\n    *   **Threats:** My body is to my LEFT (9, 7) and UP (9, 7 is one step away). The space DOWN (9, 5) is empty. The space LEFT (8, 6) is an apple.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis (Check 4 Directions from Head (9, 6)):**\n*   **UP (x=9, y=7):**\n    *   Coordinate: (9, 7).\n    *   **Self Collision:** YES.

(8, 6) is an apple.\n    *   **Result: SAFE (and beneficial).**\n*   **RIGHT (x=10, y=6):**\n    *   Coordinate: (10, 6).\n    *   **Board Check:** No. X=10 is outside.\n    *   **Result: OFF BOARD (DEADLY).**\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe move. Eats an apple (score 9). Keeps me on the top-right horizontal band (y=6), maintaining access to (7, 6) and opening up the top area. I am currently ahead in turns/efficiency compared to the enemy, so taking the immediate score is good.\n        *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 5):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safe move. Starts the descent towards the bottom row apples ((7,0), (8,0), etc.).\n        *   **Cons:** Moves away from the immediate apple at (8, 6). The bottom row is crowded with apples but also potential traps. If I go DOWN, I risk the enemy snake (if it moves right) or getting stuck if I don't have a clear path back up.\n    *   **UP/RIGHT:** Dead.\n\n*   **Decision:** LEFT is the best move. It secures a point immediately and keeps me relatively safe on the upper deck.\n*   **Future Vision (Post-Left Move):**\n    *   If I move LEFT to (8, 6), my new head is (8, 6).\n    *   My body will be [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)].\n    *   From (8, 6), I can go DOWN to (8, 5) (empty), LEFT to (7, 6) (empty), or UP to (8, 7) (empty). All seem safe.\n    *   I should avoid getting stuck in the corner at (7, 9) or (8, 9) if possible, but my current path is fine.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (8, 6) by moving LEFT. This maintains my score lead (tying or staying close depending on enemy moves) and keeps me in a flexible position. From there, I will likely head DOWN to clear the bottom right apples (7,0), (8,0), (6,0) to build length and score.\n\nLEFT\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**",

That is safe this turn and keeps lateral options (1,9 or 3,9), but hugging the top row reduces vertical escape routes one step later and can make reaching mid-board apples slightly longer.\n- RIGHT (to 3,8) keeps me in the central band where I can quickly drop south into the mid-board apple cluster. From (3,8) I will have three non-self-colliding follow-ups: UP (3,9), RIGHT (4,8), or DOWN (3,7). None of those are immediate collisions. The enemy head (9,6) cannot reach me in time and is more likely to go after nearby apples like (8,6) or (9,6).\n\nApple and space considerations:\n- Closest good apples for me are (3,4) and (6,6). Moving RIGHT keeps a straight path to x=3\u20134 and allows dropping down toward (3,4) without getting boxed by my own left-side body.\n- The enemy occupies x=5..9 on row 8, so I must avoid pushing east too far along row 8; however, stopping at (3,8) or (4,8) and then going down gives safe access to the center apples while avoiding enemy body segments.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (3,8), then evaluate: likely drop down toward (3,4) and then swing toward the (6,6)/(8,6) region if safe, always keeping at least two escape options and avoiding the enemy\u2019s right-side corridor.\n- If the enemy drifts left aggressively toward the center, yield space and take safer apples; avoid head-on contests.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's re-read the body list: (8,8) is in the list. If I move UP to (8,7), my head is at (8,7). My body follows. (8,8) is currently occupied. It will become the new \"neck\" position? No. The move happens simultaneously. My body moves to follow my previous head position (8,6). The segment at (8,8) will shift to (8,7)? No, that's not how the snake moves. The tail advances, the head advances. The body fills in.\n        *   Let's trace the movement UP from (8,6) to (8,7):\n            *   New Head: (8, 7).\n            *   New Body: (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (6, 8).\n            *   The tail (5, 8) disappears.\n            *   Does the new body hit itself?\n                *   (8, 6) is the neck. (8, 7) is the head. No collision.\n                *   (9, 7) is the next segment.\n            *   Wait, looking at the board again: Row 8 is `T T T 1 . T T T T T`.\n            *   At x=8, y=8: `T`.\n            *   At x=9, y=7: `T`.\n            *   If I move UP to (8,7), is (8,7) empty? Yes, board shows `.` at (8,7).\n            *   Is (8,7) in the new body path? No.\n            *   **Wait, is (8,7) safe?**\n            *   The board shows (8,7) is empty.\n            *   However, looking at my body list: (8,8) is currently occupied. If I move UP, my body contracts slightly? No, I didn't eat. So the tail (5,8) drops off.\n            *   The segment (8,8) moves to (7,8)? No. The segment (8,8) is currently at index 5 (0-indexed). It will shift to index 6.\n            *   Let's check the path UP to (8,7). The cell (8,7) is currently empty. It will not be occupied by my body immediately because my body is currently behind me.\n            *   However, looking closely at the board: Row 7 at x=8 is `.`.\n            *   **Self Collision:** No. (8,7) is not currently occupied by my body.\n            *   **Result: SAFE.**\n        *   **Pros:** Ascends to the open space in row 7. Opens up movement to (7,7) or (8,8) later (though (8,8) is currently blocked by my tail, but my tail will move).\n        *   **Cons:** (8,8) is currently occupied by my tail. If I go UP to (8,7), I am \"trapped\" in a sense that (8,8) is blocked. But (7,7) is open.\n    *   **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward the bottom apples. (7,5) and (6,3) are reachable.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves away from the open space at (7,7) and (8,7).\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n        *   **Pros:** Opens up (6,6) which is an apple. (6,6) is an apple!\n        *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n    *   **Comparison of LEFT vs UP vs DOWN:**\n        *   **LEFT (7,6):** No apple here. But sets me up for (6,6).\n        *   **UP (8,7):** No apple. Sets me up for (7,7) or loop back to (8,8) (which is blocked for now but will free up). (8,7) is currently empty.\n        *   **DOWN (8,5):** No apple. (7,5) is an apple.\n\n*   **Strategic Choice:**\n    *   The enemy is at (3,8). It is likely moving right/down.\n    *   My immediate target should be (6,6) or (7,5).\n    *   **LEFT to (7,6)** is the most direct path to (6,6).\n    *   **UP to (8,7)** is safe but doesn't lead to an immediate apple. It leads to (7,7), then (6,7).\n    *   **DOWN to (8,5)** leads to (7,5).\n    *   **Wait, checking the board again.**\n        *   (6, 6) is an apple. To get there from (8,6), I need to go LEFT twice: (7,6) -> (6,6).\n        *   (7, 5) is an apple. To get there, I need to go DOWN then LEFT: (8,5) -> (7,5).\n        *   (8, 5) is safe.\n        *   (7, 6) is safe.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   Enemy at (3,8). Distance to (6,6) is large. Distance to (7,5) is large.\n        *   My tail is long. Moving UP to (8,7) is safe *now*, but (8,8) is occupied by my body. If I go UP to (8,7), I cannot go UP again immediately (8,8) is blocked). I must go LEFT (7,7) or DOWN (8,6) (which is my neck).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (7,6) is safe. From there, I can go DOWN to (7,5) or LEFT to (6,6).\n        *   Moving DOWN to (8,5) is safe. From there, I can go DOWN to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,5).\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (8,5) puts me on the path to (7,5) and then the bottom row. The bottom row is crowded with apples but also narrow.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (7,6) puts me on the path to (6,6) and the center.\n        *   Moving UP to (8,7) moves me into a semi-open area but limits immediate vertical movement.\n        *   **Let's look at (7,5) vs (6,6).**\n            *   (6,6) is an apple. It is directly accessible via two LEFT moves (if (7,6) is empty).\n            *   (7,5) is an apple. Accessible via DOWN then LEFT.\n        *   **Enemy analysis:** Enemy at (3,8). It might be trying to get to (4,3) or (6,3). It's far away.\n        *   **Priority:** Secure the apple at (6,6).\n        *   To get to (6,6), I must go LEFT to (7,6) first.\n        *   Is (7,6) safe?\n            *   Board: Row 6 `T T T . . . A . 0 T`. (7,6) is at index 7. It is `.`.\n            *   Enemy body at (3,8) -> (2,8)... (0,6). No intersection.\n            *   My body: (9,6) is neck. (9,7) is next. (8,6) is current head.\n            *   (7,6) is definitely empty.\n        *   Is it better to go DOWN first?\n            *   Going DOWN to (8,5) allows me to access (7,5) and (6,5) and eventually (6,3).\n            *   However, (6,6) is closer and safer in terms of open space.\n            *   Let's check the \"crowding\" near (8,5).\n                *   Row 5: `. . . . . . . A . .`\n                *   Row 4: `. . . A . . . . A .`\n                *   (8,4) is empty.\n            *   Let's check the \"crowding\" near (7,6).\n                *   Row 6: `T T T . . . A . 0 T`\n                *   Row 7: `T T T . . . . . . T`\n                *   (7,7) is empty. (6,7) is empty.\n            *   (6,6) is an apple. (6,3) is an apple.\n            *   (7,5) is an apple.\n            *   **Path to (6,6):** (8,6) -> (7,6) -> (6,6).\n            *   **Path to (7,5):** (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (7,5).\n            *   Both are good.\n            *   **Long-term plan:** I want to collect the cluster of apples on the bottom right/center. (6,6) is the northernmost of that cluster. (7,5) is slightly south.\n            *   My body is currently blocking the top-right. Moving LEFT towards the center (6,6) feels like \"invading\" the center, which is good.\n            *   Moving DOWN towards (7,5) feels like \"dropping\" into the bottom row.\n            *   **Which is safer?**\n                *   If I go DOWN to (8,5), my body will follow. The space (8,6) becomes my neck. (9,6) becomes part of the body.\n                *   If I go LEFT to (7,6), (8,6) becomes my neck.\n            *   **Enemy Head-on Collision?**\n                *   Enemy is at (3,8). It moves probably towards (4,8) or (3,7) or (2,8) (wait, 2,8 is its body).\n                *   The board shows `1` at (3,8). The body list given in the prompt description starts at (2,8). This suggests the head is indeed at (3,8) and the body segments start at (2,8).\n                *   Enemy path: Likely towards (4,8) or (3,7).\n                *   My path: (7,6) or (8,5).\n                *   Distance is large. Collision is not a concern this turn.\n            *   **Final check on UP:**\n                *   UP to (8,7). (8,7) is `.`.\n                *   My body: (8,8) is occupied. If I move UP to (8,7), I cannot go UP again. I am in a \"corridor\" between (8,8) and (7,7).\n                *   This is restrictive.\n            *   **Final check on LEFT:**\n                *   LEFT to (7,6).\n                *   From (7,6), I can go DOWN to (7,5) (apple), LEFT to (6,6) (apple), or UP to (7,7) (safe).\n                *   This offers excellent mobility.\n            *   **Final check on DOWN:**\n                *   DOWN to (8,5).\n                *   From (8,5), I can go DOWN to (8,4) (safe), LEFT to (7,5) (apple), or UP to (8,6) (neck).\n                *   Also good mobility, but I am moving towards the board edge (bottom).\n            *   **Conclusion:** LEFT is the best balance. It moves toward the apple at (6,6) and maintains central flexibility.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 6) to position myself for the apple at (6, 6). From there, I will likely grab (6, 6) and then descend to the lower apples ((7, 5), (6, 3)) to build length and score. I must monitor the enemy snake's movement toward the center to avoid head-on collisions in later turns.\n\nLEFT\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

After moving down I will have multiple safe continuations (up back into the space I just left is allowed in future turns only if not directly backwards into neck \u2014 practically I retain moves DOWN to (3,6) and RIGHT to (4,7)), and I avoid getting boxed along the top edge or pushing toward the enemy.\n\nTactical reasoning:\n- The enemy is concentrated on the far right/top (x\u22485\u20139, y\u22488\u20139) and is closer to the high-value apples at (6,6) and the lower-right cluster. I should avoid contesting that corridor and instead secure reachable apples in the center (e.g., (3,4)) while keeping escape options.\n- Moving DOWN preserves the most immediate safe follow-ups and keeps me centrally located for several apples while minimizing head-on collision risk.\n\nShort plan for the next turns:\n- Move down into the central corridor, head toward (3,4) to pick apples there, then evaluate whether to swing right toward (6,6) if the enemy shifts away, otherwise continue clearing lower-left apples.

The text description lists the head as (3, 7), which matches the board.\n    *   **Apples:** (6, 6) is adjacent to my head (LEFT). (7, 5) is DOWN. (6, 3) is available but further away.\n\n2.  **Immediate Move Evaluation (Check 4 Directions from (7, 6)):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 7):** Board shows `.` at (7, 7). My body is at (7, 8) and (6, 8), etc. (7, 7) is not occupied by my body. Safe. No apple.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 5):** Board shows `A` at (7, 5). This is an apple. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy. Safe. Eating apple allows growth.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 6):** Board shows `A` at (6, 6). This is an apple. Safe. Eating apple allows growth.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Board shows `T` at (8, 6). This is my own body segment. Deadly. Cannot move here.\n\n3.  **Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT vs UP):**\n    *   **UP (7, 7):** Moves away from the immediate apples. While (7, 7) is open, it doesn't offer a score increase and puts distance between me and the apples at (6, 6) and (7, 5).\n    *   **DOWN (7, 5):** Eat apple. Good. From there, I can move to (6, 5), (8, 5), or (7, 4). (6, 5) is open. (8, 5) is open. (7, 4) is open.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 6):** Eat apple. Good. From there, I can move to (5, 6), (6, 5), or (6, 7).\n        *   (5, 6) is open.\n        *   (6, 5) is open.\n        *   (6, 7) is open.\n\n4.  **Strategic Consideration:**\n    *   Both LEFT and DOWN offer apples and safe subsequent moves.\n    *   The enemy snake is at (3, 7). The distance is significant, and they are likely occupied with their own apples or pathing.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (6, 6) puts me on a direct path to the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (e.g., (4, 3), (2, 0)). It also keeps me slightly more central than moving DOWN to the bottom edge immediately.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (7, 5) is also a valid path to the bottom row apples ((6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)).\n    *   However, (6, 6) is currently an apple and is directly to my left. Securing that point is immediate. The path from (6, 6) allows for flexibility: I can go DOWN to (6, 5) to head towards the bottom, or LEFT towards (5, 6) and (4, 6) to sweep the center.\n    *   Let's look at the board specifically at (6, 6). It is an apple.\n    *   Let's look at (7, 5). It is an apple.\n\n    **Decision:** I will move **LEFT** to (6, 6) to eat the apple. This grows my length and positions me to target the remaining apples in the center/left area. From (6, 6), I have safe moves to (5, 6), (6, 5), or (6, 7), maintaining flexibility.\n\n5.  **Safety Check for (6, 6):**\n    *   Target: (6, 6).\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No. My body is at (8, 6), (9, 6)... (7, 8). (6, 6) is empty.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy? No.\n    *   Is it backwards? My previous head was at (7, 6). Moving to (6, 6) is LEFT. My neck is at (8, 6). Not backwards.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6, 6). From there, navigate towards the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board ((6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)) or sweep the center-left quadrant. Monitor the enemy snake (3, 7) to avoid future collisions as they approach the center.\n\nLEFT",

(Empty). The Enemy Body text lists (3, 7) first, but the Board State shows '.' there. Let's trust the Board State visual for current locations. The Enemy Head is definitely at (3, 6) based on the '1' at that coordinate in row 6.*\n    *   **Apples:** (6, 6) is an apple (I am sitting on it). Other apples exist. Note (7, 5) is an apple.\n\n2.  **Available Moves from (6, 6):**\n    *   **UP (6, 7):** Board shows `.` (Empty). My body is at (6, 8) (The tail is at (6, 8)? No, Body is [(7, 6)... (6, 8)]. (6, 7) is not in my body list. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 5):** Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 6):** Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Board shows `T` (My own body, the segment immediately following head). This is a collision.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n    *   **Option A: UP (6, 7):**\n        *   Leads to (6, 7). From there, I can go to (6, 8), (5, 7), or (7, 7).\n        *   (6, 8) is currently my body (occupied).\n        *   (5, 7) is empty.\n        *   (7, 7) is empty.\n        *   This is a narrow path. Moving UP restricts my movement options immediately because one direction (UP) hits my body.\n    *   **Option B: DOWN (6, 5):**\n        *   Leads to (6, 5). From there, I can go to (6, 4), (5, 5), or (7, 5).\n        *   (7, 5) is an apple. This is attractive.\n        *   (5, 5) and (6, 4) are empty.\n        *   This moves me towards the bottom edge and the cluster of apples there ((6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)).\n    *   **Option C: LEFT (5, 6):**\n        *   Leads to (5, 6). From there, I can go to (5, 5), (4, 6), or (5, 7).\n        *   All are empty.\n        *   This moves me towards the center-left apples ((4, 3), (2, 0)).\n\n4.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   The Enemy Snake is at (3, 6). This is very close to me horizontally.\n    *   My head is at (6, 6). Enemy head is at (3, 6). Distance is 3 cells.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (5, 6), I reduce the distance to 2 cells. If the Enemy moves RIGHT, we are on a collision course.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (6, 5), I move off the direct horizontal line with the enemy. This is safer regarding a potential head-on collision. The enemy is likely looking for apples near (4, 3) or (2, 0). Moving DOWN keeps me out of their immediate path.\n    *   Additionally, moving DOWN to (6, 5) positions me to grab the apple at (7, 5) on the subsequent turn (if safe), or navigate to the bottom row.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving UP is risky due to tight space.\n    *   Moving LEFT into the enemy's direct path is risky given they are likely moving towards the center.\n    *   Moving DOWN offers safety from the enemy collision and opens up the bottom area.\n    *   I will choose **DOWN**.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 5) to avoid the direct horizontal collision risk with the enemy at (3, 6). From (6, 5), I will head towards the apple at (7, 5) or (6, 4) to sweep the bottom-right area. I need to keep the enemy on my left side and avoid the center-left trap until the enemy passes or clears it.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy cannot move directly into my new square this turn, but moving right narrows my future options and invites contest with the enemy.\n- DOWN (3,5) is open and moves directly toward the nearby apple at (3,4) (2 steps away).

I just moved DOWN from (6, 6).\n    *   **Enemy Status:** 9 apples, head at (3, 5) (Based on the board state visualization showing '1' at row 5, column 3). The enemy's previous head was at (3, 6). They likely moved DOWN.\n    *   **Apples:** (7, 5) is an apple adjacent to my head to the RIGHT. (6, 0) and (7, 0) are apples at the bottom right.\n\n2.  **Available Moves from (6, 5):**\n    *   **UP (6, 6):** Board shows `.` (Empty). I just came from here.

This is a valid move that results in growth.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n    *   **Option A: RIGHT (7, 5) - Eating the Apple:**\n        *   This is the strongest immediate play. It increases my score to 11 and grows my body, which is always beneficial.\n        *   From (7, 5), I can see a path down the right side: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0) (Apple), (8, 0) (Apple), (9, 0) (Edge).\n        *   This moves me away from the enemy snake who is located at (3, 5) in the left/center area. The distance to the enemy increases, reducing collision risk.\n    *   **Option B: LEFT (5, 5):**\n        *   Moving towards the enemy at (3, 5). If the enemy continues moving DOWN or RIGHT, we might collide.\n        *   This does not gain a point.\n    *   **Option C: DOWN (6, 4):**\n        *   Moves towards (6, 3) (Apple) and (6, 2) (Apple).\n        *   This keeps me relatively close to the enemy horizontally.\n    *   **Option D: UP (6, 6):**\n        *   Moves back to where I was.\n        *   My body is at (6, 7) above.\n        *   The enemy is at (3, 5). This is not a direct collision path, but it's a backward step.\n\n4.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   The enemy is at (3, 5). My head is at (6, 5). There is a 3-cell gap between us horizontally.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 5), the gap widens to 4 cells (distance from x=7 to x=3).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 5), the gap shrinks to 2 cells.\n    *   Given the enemy likely wants to eat apples on the left side (like (2, 0) or (4, 3)), moving RIGHT is the safest divergence of paths. It secures an apple immediately and opens up the rich bottom-right corner.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   **RIGHT** is the optimal move. It guarantees a point, grows the snake, and moves towards a cluster of apples ((7, 0), (8, 0)) while distancing from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (7, 5). From (7, 5), scan for the next move towards (7, 0) or (8, 0). The enemy is in the left sector; I will dominate the right sector.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body follows in a winding pattern: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)].\n    *   **Enemy Status:** Snake #1 is at (3, 4). Its body extends upwards: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6)].\n    *   **Apples:** There is an apple at (7, 4) directly below my head. There is an apple at (7, 3) further down.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Last Move:**\n    *   My previous move was RIGHT from (6, 5) to (7, 5).\n    *   Snake #1 likely moved DOWN from (3, 5) to (3, 4), as the board shows '1' at (3, 4).\n    *   The apple I was standing on ((7, 5)) is no longer there in the current board state, meaning I successfully ate it last turn. My score is now 11.\n\n3.  **Available Moves from (7, 5):**\n    *   **UP (7, 6):** Contains my own body segment. **Unsafe (Suicide).**\n    *   **DOWN (7, 4):** Contains an apple (`A`). Visually clear on the board.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 5):** Contains my own body segment (the one immediately behind me). **Unsafe (Suicide).**\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 5):** Empty space (`.`).\n\n4.  **Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **Option A: DOWN (7, 4):**\n        *   **Pros:** Eats an apple (+1 point, score 12). Moves closer to the bottom-right apple cluster ((7, 0), (8, 0)).\n        *   **Cons:** Potential head-on collision. The enemy snake at (3, 4) could move RIGHT to (4, 4). If I move DOWN to (7, 4), the distance is 3 cells. However, the enemy also has apples available at (4, 3). If the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3), we are safe. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 4), we are safe.\n        *   **Trajectory:** From (7, 4), I can continue DOWN to (7, 3) (another apple).\n    *   **Option B: RIGHT (8, 5):**\n        *   **Pros:** Avoids the potential \"safe zone\" conflict if the enemy decides to move right. Clears the path to (9, 5) and then down the right edge.\n        *   **Cons:** Misses the immediate apple at (7, 4). This apple might be taken by the enemy or become inaccessible later. Losing an apple when it's guaranteed is usually a bad trade unless survival is at risk.\n        *   **Trajectory:** From (8, 5), the path is open, but the immediate reward is zero.\n\n5.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   The enemy is at (3, 4). They are \"compressed\" in the left column. They are likely looking for apples at (4, 3) or (2, 0).\n    *   I am at (7, 5).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (7, 4) secures a point. The risk of collision is low because the enemy has no clear reason to rush 3 cells to the right to collide with me when they have apples in their immediate vicinity (like (4, 3)).\n    *   Missing an apple right under my nose sets me back in the score race (11 vs 10, I need to maintain the lead).\n    *   Therefore, taking the apple is the high-percentage play.\n\n6.  **Decision:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the move. It scores a point and positions me to continue downwards toward the bottom row apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 4). If possible, continue DOWN to (7, 3) for another apple. The enemy is on the left side; I will secure the right side bottom apples ((7, 0), (8, 0), (6, 0)). Watch for the enemy moving right in the future to cut me off, but for now, the path is clear.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)] (Note: My body list in the prompt starts with the head, so the segment at (7, 5) is part of the body logic for the next turn).\n    *   **Enemy Status:** Snake #1 is at (3, 4) with a body occupying the left column.\n    *   **Apples:** Apples at (7, 4) and (7, 3) are directly south of my head.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Last Move:**\n    *   Last move was DOWN to (7, 5).\n    *   Apple at (7, 5) was eaten (score 11).\n\n3.  **Available Moves from (7, 5):**\n    *   **UP (7, 6):** Occupied by my own body. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **DOWN (7, 4):** Contains an apple. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT (6, 5):** Occupied by my own body. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 5):** Empty space. **Safe.**\n\n4.  **Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **Option A: DOWN (7, 4):**\n        *   **Pros:** Eats an apple (Score 12). Opens path to (7, 3) (another apple).\n        *   **Cons:** Potential collision if Enemy moves RIGHT. Distance from (3, 4) to (7, 4) is 4 units. Enemy moving right to (4, 4) is unlikely to collide this turn, but I must watch future turns.\n        *   **Strategy:** Securing points is critical to maintaining the lead (11 vs 10).\n    *   **Option B: RIGHT (8, 5):**\n        *   **Pros:** Safer regarding immediate collision with Enemy (distant).\n        *   **Cons:** Misses immediate apple points. Sets me back in the score race.\n        *   **Strategy:** Passive play, usually bad when points are available.\n\n5.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   The enemy is stationary on the left. My immediate vicinity is safe except for my own tail.\n    *   Moving DOWN eats an apple and positions me for a chain of apples (7,3 -> bottom row).\n    *   Missing an apple when the move is safe is a tactical error.\n\n6.  **Decision:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the correct move. It scores points and advances my position toward the dense apple cluster at the bottom right.\n\nDOWN",

(8, 3) is empty.\n\n2. **Analysis of Moves from (7, 3):**\n   *   **LEFT (6, 3):** Contains an apple. **High Risk.**\n       *   The enemy head is at (4, 3). If the enemy moves RIGHT twice (e.g., strategic path finding), it could collide.\n       *   More importantly, the enemy is at (4, 3). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 3), and I move LEFT to (6, 3), we are adjacent. If the enemy continues RIGHT to (6, 3) next turn, I die. However, the immediate risk is a head-on collision if the enemy moves to (6, 3) *this turn*. The distance is 2 units. If the enemy moves RIGHT twice is impossible in one turn. Wait, the enemy is at (4, 3). To collide at (6, 3), they would need to move 2 steps. Impossible.\n       *   Let's reconsider the collision rule. If two heads move into the same cell, both die.

No collision.\n       *   However, looking at the board state (Turn 27 provided state), the enemy is at (4, 3). If I move LEFT to (6, 3), I am moving towards the enemy. The enemy might move RIGHT to (5, 3). This puts them adjacent to my new head position (6, 3).\n       *   **Crucial Check:** Is (6, 3) occupied? It is an apple. It is not a snake body.\n       *   **Wait:** I am at (7, 3). My body is at (7, 4).

A `\n           Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n           Enemy is at index 4 (x=4, y=3).\n           Apple is at index 6 (x=6, y=3).\n           My head is at index 7 (x=7, y=3).\n       *   If I move LEFT to (6, 3), I eat the apple.\n       *   The enemy at (4, 3) might move RIGHT to (5, 3). This is safe for me this turn.\n       *   *However*, moving into the center where the enemy is active is risky. The enemy has a long body on the left.\n       *   **Alternative:** RIGHT to (8, 3).\n           *   (8, 3) is empty (map shows '.').\n           *   This moves me away from the enemy.\n           *   (8, 3) offers access to (8, 4) and (9, 3) apples.\n       *   **Comparing Safety:**\n           *   LEFT (6, 3): Puts me adjacent to enemy (if enemy moves to 5,3). Increases density of interaction.\n           *   RIGHT (8, 3): Puts me further from enemy. Open space to the right.\n       *   **Score Logic:** I am winning (12 vs 11). Minimizing risk is paramount. Moving towards the enemy (LEFT) reduces safety margin.\n       *   **Board State Check:** Is there a wall?

My immediate body segments are at (7, 3) and (7, 4).\nAvailable moves from (8, 3):\n- **UP to (8, 4):** Contains an apple.\n- **DOWN to (8, 2):** Empty.\n- **LEFT to (7, 3):** My own body (Immediate Death).\n- **RIGHT to (9, 3):** Contains an apple.\n\nAnalyzing the threats:\n1. **Enemy Snake #1** is at (5, 3). It is to my left. The enemy body blocks the column x=4 (from y=3 to y=8) and the row y=3 (from x=3 to x=4). The enemy head is at (5, 3).\n   - If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (6, 3), it will eat the apple there. (6, 3) is currently empty.\n   - If the enemy moves **UP** or **DOWN**, it hits its own body at (4, 3) or (4, 4) (Wait, looking at the body list: Head (5,3) -> Body (4,3). If enemy moves UP to (5,4), body is at (5,3). If enemy moves DOWN to (5,2), body is at (5,3). Both are safe regarding its own body).\n   - However, looking at the Board State for Row 3: ` . . . . T 1 A T 0 A ` (Indices 0-9).\n     - Index 3 is `T` (Wall/Snake Body at (3,3)? No, map legend says `T` is tail or body).\n     - Index 4 is `T` (Body at 4,3).\n     - Index 5 is `1` (Head at 5,3).\n     - Index 6 is `A` (Apple at 6,3).\n     - Index 7 is `T` (My body at 7,3).\n     - Index 8 is `0` (My head at 8,3).\n     - Index 9 is `A` (Apple at 9,3).\n\n   - **Collision Risk Check:**\n     - The enemy head is at (5, 3).\n     - My head is at (8, 3).\n     - The cell (6, 3) is between us.\n     - If I move **LEFT** to (7, 3), I hit my own body. **Eliminated.**\n     - If I move **UP** to (8, 4), I am safe from head-on collision with the enemy (Enemy max speed is 1 cell, distance is 3 cells).\n     - If I move **DOWN** to (8, 2), I am safe.\n     - If I move **RIGHT** to (9, 3), I am safe.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - I am tied on apples (12-12). I must eat to gain an advantage or survive to win by turn count.\n   - **Option A (RIGHT to 9,3):** Eats an apple. (9, 3) is safe. However, looking at the map, (9, 3) is in the top right corner. Row 9 shows ` . . . . . A A . T T`. The positions (9, 8) and (9, 9) are occupied by my tail (`T`). Moving to (9, 3) heads towards a dead end. (9, 4) is empty, but (9, 5) is empty, (9, 6) is my body. The path upwards is blocked by my own body at (9, 6). This is a trap.\n   - **Option B (UP to 8, 4):** Eats an apple. (8, 4) is safe. From (8, 4), I have access to (8, 5) and (9, 4). (9, 4) is empty. (8, 5) is empty. This keeps options open.\n   - **Option C (DOWN to 8, 2):** Safe, but no apple. (8, 2) is empty. (8, 1) is empty. (8, 0) is an apple. This leads to (8, 0), which is in the bottom right. However, going down takes me away from the enemy, which is good. But (8, 2) connects to (8, 1) and (8, 0). (8, 0) is an apple.\n\n   - **Comparing B and C:**\n     - **B (UP to 8, 4):** Eats immediately. (8, 4) is adjacent to (8, 5) (empty) and (9, 4) (empty). The board state shows Row 4 has an apple at (8, 4) and (6, 2) is an apple but that's far. (8, 4) is a good spot.\n     - **C (DOWN to 8, 2):** No immediate apple. (8, 0) is an apple but 2 moves away. (8, 2) is safe. (7, 2) is empty. (6, 2) is an apple (distant).\n\n   - **Enemy Prediction:**\n     - Enemy is at (5, 3). It likely sees the apple at (6, 3) or wants to move right. If it moves right to (6, 3), it is engaging. If it moves up or down, it is repositioning.\n     - If I go UP to (8, 4), I am securing a high-value apple and keeping a path open to the top right area (though my tail is there, I have space to maneuver).\n     - If I go DOWN to (8, 2), I am avoiding the enemy but taking a non-scoring move. Since we are tied, taking an apple is crucial.\n\n   - **Final Decision:** Move **UP** to (8, 4). It secures an apple immediately and maintains a better field position than (9, 3) or (8, 2). (8, 4) is adjacent to (9, 4) and (8, 5), both empty. (9, 3) is a dead end.\n\n**UP**",

Their possible moves this turn are UP (8,4), RIGHT (9,3), or DOWN (8,2). None of those reach (6,3) this turn, so moving to (6,3) is not contested by a head-on collision.\n- (6,3) is not occupied by either snake\u2019s body now, so moving RIGHT is safe this turn and will eat an apple.\n- UP and DOWN are safe but slower for immediate scoring and keep fewer short-term gains than grabbing the nearby apple.\n\nMove choice and short-term plan:\n- I will move RIGHT to (6,3) and eat the apple. This increases my apple count and keeps pressure in the nearby apple cluster (6,2) and (6,9).\n- Next turn I will reassess: if (6,2) is still safe I can take it (by moving DOWN); otherwise I\u2019ll fallback to (5,2) or (5,4) to avoid being funneled by the enemy.

If the enemy avoids me, I\u2019ll continue collecting nearby apples while keeping escape options open.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\n2.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    -   Enemy head is at (6, 3).\n    -   Enemy body is to its left at (5, 3).\n    -   Enemy has apples at (6, 3) and (9, 3) within range.\n    -   **Critical Threat:** (9, 3) is an apple directly to my right.\n        -   If the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (7, 3), it is blocked by my body.\n        -   If the enemy moves **RIGHT twice** (impossible in one turn) it's irrelevant.\n        -   The enemy is 2 steps away from (9, 3). I am 1 step away.\n        -   However, the enemy might target (6, 3) or (9, 3).\n        -   If I move **RIGHT to (9, 4)**:\n            -   I am safe for this turn.\n            -   Next turn, the enemy could reach (8, 3) or (9, 3).\n            -   If the enemy is at (8, 3) and I am at (9, 4), I am safe.\n            -   *But*, if the enemy goes for (9, 3), and I am at (9, 4), we are adjacent. If I then move to (9, 3), we collide.\n            -   More importantly, (9, 3) is a trap. My tail occupies (9, 6), (9, 7), etc. (9, 5) is empty, but (9, 6) is my body. I cannot stay in column 9 for long.\n            -   If I go RIGHT to (9, 4), I am forcing myself into a corner against my own tail.\n\n3.  **Evaluating LEFT to (7, 4):**\n    -   **Safety:** (7, 4) is empty.\n    -   **Next Move Options:** From (7, 4), I can go UP (7, 5), DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), or RIGHT (8, 4).\n        -   (7, 5) is my body.\n        -   (7, 3) is my body.\n        -   (8, 4) is where I just came from (safe if I grow).\n        -   (6, 4) is empty.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** Moving LEFT puts me closer to the center of the board (x=6, x=5) which is where the enemy is. This seems dangerous, but look at the board layout.\n        -   Row 4: ` . . . T T . . T 0 . ` (Previous turn map shows ` . . . T T . . T A . ` at turn 29). Currently, (8, 4) has the apple (which I ate). (7, 4) is empty.\n        -   Row 5: ` . A . T . . T T . . ` - (6, 5) and (7, 5) are my body.\n        -   Row 3: ` . . . .

Wait, turn 30 body list is not provided yet, only turn 29).\n        -   Let's rely on the turn 29 board state which shows the state *before* my move.\n            -   Row 4: ` . . . T T . .

The enemy is at (5, 3). It wants (6, 3) or (9, 3).\n        -   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 3) and I move LEFT to (7, 4), we are adjacent but not colliding.\n        -   If the enemy moves UP to (6, 4), and I move LEFT to (7, 4), we are adjacent.\n        -   If the enemy moves UP to (6, 4) and I move LEFT to (7, 4), we are safe this turn.\n        -   *However*, (7, 4) is a dead end. (7, 5) is my body. (7, 3) is my body. (6, 4) might be open, or might be a trap. (8, 4) is open if I just left it.\n        -   **Wait.** (7, 4) is a \"corridor\". It is surrounded by my body (7, 5) and (7, 3). This is extremely dangerous.

(Blocked).\n        -   (8, 4) is empty (I ate the apple, so it's my body segment *behind* me? No, the apple disappears. If I eat it, (8, 4) becomes my body). Wait. If I eat the apple at (8, 4), I grow. The cell (8, 4) remains part of my body. So (8, 4) is safe to return to immediately after eating? No, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\". But if I grow, the body extends. (8, 4) will be the second segment.\n        -   So from (8, 5), (8, 4) is my body. **Blocked.**\n        -   (7, 5) is my body. **Blocked.**\n        -   (9, 5) is empty.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** This looks like a trap. (8, 5) has only one exit: (9, 5). (8, 6) is my body. (8, 4) becomes my body. (7, 5) is my body.\n        -   If I go UP to (8, 5), I am forced to go RIGHT to (9, 5) next.\n        -   From (9, 5), I can go UP (9, 6) [Body], DOWN (9, 4) [Empty], LEFT (8, 5) [Body].\n        -   (9, 5) forces me to (9, 4).\n        -   This leads me straight into the corner of column 9, where my tail is blocking the top.\n        -   **Eliminated.**\n\n5.  **Evaluating DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    -   This is my own body segment. **Death.** Eliminated.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluating RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n    -   **Safety:** (9, 4) is empty.\n    -   **Next Move Options:** From (9, 4), I can go UP (9, 5), DOWN (9, 3), LEFT (8, 4), RIGHT (Off-board).\n        -   (9, 5) is empty.\n        -   (9, 3) is empty (I didn't eat it, I ate (8, 4)).\n        -   (8, 4) is my body.\n    -   **Strategic Value:**\n        -   I am at (9, 4).\n        -   Enemy is at (6, 3). They might target (9, 3) or (6, 3).\n        -   If I stay here, I have access to (9, 5) and (9, 3).\n        -   (9, 5) leads to (9, 6) [My Body].

From (9, 5), I can only go DOWN to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 5). (8, 5) is empty.\n        -   If I go UP to (9, 5), I have 1 option (LEFT to 8, 5).\n        -   If I go DOWN to (9, 3), I have 1 option (LEFT to 8, 3) which is my body? No, (8, 3) will be my body.

No. (9, 4) connects to (9, 5) and (9, 3).\n        -   (9, 5) connects to (8, 5) and (9, 4).\n        -   (8, 5) connects to (8, 4) [Body], (8, 6) [Body], (7, 5) [Body], (9, 5) [Visited].\n        -   (8, 5) is a dead end too.\n        -   **Wait.** The board layout is a trap.\n            -   Row 8: ` T T T T . . . A . T ` (Turn 30 start). (8, 8) is T. (8, 7) is A? No, (7, 8) is A.\n            -   Row 9: ` . . . . . A A . T T ` (Turn 30 start). (9, 9) is T. (9, 8) is T.\n            -   My body occupies (9, 6) -> (9, 9) and (8, 9).\n            -   The column x=9 is blocked at y=6 and above.\n            -   The row y=5 is blocked at x=8? No, (8, 5) is empty.\n            -   The row y=5 has ` . A . T . . T T . . ` (Turn 29). (6, 5) and (7, 5) are my body.\n            -   So from (9, 4), I can go UP to (9, 5). From (9, 5), I can go LEFT to (8, 5).\n            -   From (8, 5), I can only go LEFT to (7, 5)? No, (7, 5) is my body.\n            -   (8, 5) is surrounded by (7, 5) [Body], (8, 4) [Body], (8, 6) [Body].\n            -   (8, 5) is a death trap.\n            -   (9, 5) is a death trap (leads to 8,5).\n            -   (9, 4) leads to 9,5 (trap) or 9,3 (trap).\n            -   **So (9, 4) is a trap.**\n\n7.  **Wait, I eliminated UP (8,5), LEFT (7,4), DOWN (Death), and RIGHT (9,4).**\n    -   There must be a safe move.\n    -   Let's look at **LEFT (7, 4)** again.\n    -   (7, 4) is surrounded by (7, 3) [Body], (7, 5) [Body], (6, 4) [Empty], (8, 4) [Empty].\n    -   (8, 4) is where I am coming from. If I eat the apple at (8, 4), (8, 4) becomes my body.\n    -   So from (7, 4), I can go LEFT to (6, 4).\n    -   (6, 4) is empty.\n    -   (6, 4) is adjacent to (6, 3) [Apple], (6, 5) [Body], (5, 4) [Empty], (7, 4) [Visited].\n    -   (5, 4) is empty.\n    -   (5, 4) is adjacent to (5, 3) [Enemy Head], (5, 5) [Empty], (4, 4) [Enemy Body], (6, 4) [Visited].\n    -   This path leads towards the enemy.\n    -   BUT, looking at the Board State for Turn 30 (which is *after* my move):\n        -   Row 4: ` . . .

In Turn 29, my body was `[(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), ...]`.\n            -   This means (7, 4) is occupied by my body *before* I move.\n            -   **Correction:** My body at Turn 29 is `[(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]`.\n            -   So (7, 4) is **BLOCKED** by my own body.\n            -   **LEFT to (7, 4) is DEATH.** (Re-confirmed elimination).\n\n    -   **Re-evaluating UP to (8, 5):**\n        -   Is (8, 5) blocked?

Can go to (9, 3) [Apple] immediately.\n        -   **RIGHT is more direct to the apple.**\n\n        -   **Is there any risk of collision with the enemy?**\n        -   Enemy at (6, 3).\n        -   If I go to (9, 4), the distance is large.\n        -   Enemy might go for (6, 3) or (9, 3).\n        -   If enemy goes to (9, 3), and I go to (9, 4), we are adjacent.\n        -   If enemy goes to (9, 3) and I go to (9, 3), we die.\n        -   If enemy goes to (9, 3) and I go to (9, 4), I survive.\n        -   The enemy is far away. It takes them 3 moves to reach (9, 3).\n        -   It takes me 1 move to reach (9, 4), then 1 move to reach (9, 3).\n        -   If I go to (9, 4) now, next turn I can go to (9, 3).\n        -   The turn after that, I am at (9, 3).\n        -   The enemy would be at (7, 3) or (8, 3) (My body) or (9, 3) (Collision).\n        -   Can the enemy reach (9, 3) in 2 turns?\n        -   (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (8, 3). No.\n        -   (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (8, 3) -> (9, 3).\n        -   So it takes the enemy 3 turns.\n        -   I can eat the apple and leave before the enemy arrives.\n\n        -   **Wait.** (7, 3) is my body.\n        -   The enemy CANNOT go to (7, 3).\n        -   The enemy is blocked by my body to the right.\n        -   The enemy is at (6, 3).\n        -   My body occupies (7, 3), (8, 3).\n        -   The enemy CANNOT get to (9, 3) by going through my body.\n        -   The enemy must go around.\n        -   (6, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) [My Body] -> Blocked.\n        -   (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (8, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 3).\n        -   This is 5 moves.\n        -   So (9, 3) is completely safe from the enemy.\n\n        -   **So the plan is:**\n        -   Move RIGHT to (9, 4).\n        -   Next turn move DOWN to (9, 3) (Apple).\n        -   Then move DOWN to (9, 2) to escape the corner.\n\n        -   **Is there a better move?**\n        -   Moving LEFT to (7, 4) is death.\n        -   Moving UP to (8, 5) is safe but slower to the apple.\n        -   Moving DOWN to (8, 3) is death.\n        -   Moving RIGHT to (9, 4) is safe and positions me to eat the apple at (9, 3).\n\n        -   **Wait.** The board shows (9, 3) is an apple.\n        -   Row 3: ` . . . . T 1 T T T A `\n        -   (9, 3) is 'A'.\n        -   Yes.\n        -   (9, 4) is empty ('.').\n        -   Yes.\n\n        -   **Final check on UP (8, 5).**\n        -   (8, 5) is empty.\n        -   If I go UP, I am trapped in a 2-cell cycle (8, 5) <-> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3).\n        -   If I go RIGHT, I can go directly to (9, 4) -> (9, 3).\n        -   RIGHT is more efficient.\n\n        -   **One more check on (9, 4).**\n        -   Is it possible that the enemy moves to (9, 4)?\n        -   No, enemy is at (6, 3). Distance is 3. Max speed is 1.\n        -   So (9, 4) is safe.\n\n        -   **Decision:** RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 4) to position myself for the apple at (9, 3). The enemy snake is blocked by my body at (7, 3) and cannot reach the top right corner quickly. I will eat the apple at (9, 3) next turn and then move down to (9, 2) to ensure an escape route. The enemy seems to be stuck in the left side of the board, possibly trying to navigate around its own tail or the walls.\n\n**RIGHT**",

The apple is directly below me. Eating it is the optimal move for growth.\n    *   **Escape Route:** If I eat the apple at (9, 3), I will grow. The cell (9, 4) becomes my body. My escape path from the corner will be (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1). These cells are currently empty.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy #1 is at (6, 2). The apple at (9, 3) is closer to me. The enemy cannot reach (9, 3) in one turn. Even if they head for it, I will have eaten it and be leaving the corner before they arrive.\n    *   **Danger of UP (9, 5):** Moving UP puts me at (9, 5). From there, the only safe move is LEFT to (8, 5). However, (8, 5) is a \"corridor\" surrounded by my own body at (8, 4) and (8, 6), and the wall at x=7 is blocked by my body (7, 4) and (7, 5). Moving UP traps me in a narrow path with no long-term escape. Moving DOWN allows me to eat the apple and then exit the corner column.\n\n3.  **Decision:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 3) to eat the apple and secure growth, preserving the exit route via (9, 2).\n\nDOWN",

This is now occupied by my body (the segment that was the head last turn). **DEAD**.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (9, 2).\n    *   Is (9, 2) occupied? No.\n    *   Is it out of bounds? No.\n    *   Is it an apple? No (Apples listed: (7, 0), (6, 0), (8, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (3, 1), (6, 9), (2, 1), (5, 6), (1, 5), (5, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7), (4, 9), (0, 3)). (9, 2) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe from collision with Enemy #1? Enemy #1 is at (6, 1). If Enemy #1 moves UP to (6, 2), RIGHT to (7, 1), or stays, it won't hit (9, 2).\n    *   Future moves from (9, 2): Can go DOWN to (9, 1), LEFT to (8, 2).\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT:** To (8, 3).\n    *   Is (8, 3) occupied? Yes, by my body. The segment list includes (8, 3) coming after (8, 4) and before (7, 3). Specifically, my body is: (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), **(8, 3)**...\n    *   Wait, let's re-verify the body list.

Moving LEFT into (8, 3) is suicide.\n    *   **Result:** DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (10, 3). Out of bounds (0-9). **DEAD**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only valid move is **DOWN** to (9, 2). This keeps me in the right column but allows me to eventually descend towards the apples at (9, 0) or (8, 0). Since I am growing, my body occupies more space. I need to ensure I don't get trapped. Moving DOWN opens up the path to (9, 1) and (9, 0) in subsequent turns. (9, 0) is currently empty on the board visualization. I must be careful not to enter a loop, but for this turn, survival dictates moving DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Descend the right column to clear out apples at (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0) if accessible without trapping myself.

I must move LEFT to (8, 3) to survive. From (8, 3), I will assess the map. The cluster of apples at (7, 0), (6, 0), (8, 0) is tempting, but my body is currently filling much of the right side of the board. I need to maneuver carefully to avoid trapping myself. The enemy snake is at (6, 0) but moves before I do. If he moves UP, he is safe. If he moves LEFT or RIGHT, he risks death. Regardless, I must move LEFT now.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nMy current head is at (9, 2).\nMy body currently occupies the following coordinates: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)].\nI need to move to a coordinate that is not occupied by my body and is within the board boundaries (0-9).\n\nLet's evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP:** To (9, 3).\n    *   Checking my body list: (9, 3) is the first segment immediately after my head.\n    *   Result: Collision. **DEAD**.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** To (9, 1).\n    *   Checking my body list: (9, 1) is not in my body.\n    *   Is it within bounds? Yes.\n    *   Result: **Safe**.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** To (8, 2).\n    *   Checking my body list: (8, 2) is not in my body.\n    *   Is it within bounds? Yes.\n    *   Result: **Safe**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (10, 2).\n    *   Is it within bounds? No (max x is 9).\n    *   Result: **DEAD**.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (9, 1) or LEFT to (8, 2).\n\n**Analysis of safe moves:**\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 1):**\n    *   This keeps me on the right wall.\n    *   Next turn from (9, 1), I could move DOWN to (9, 0) or LEFT to (8, 1).\n    *   (9, 0) is currently empty.\n    *   However, my body is currently blocking a large portion of the right side of the board. By staying in column 9, I maintain a linear movement but reduce my lateral maneuverability.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 2):**\n    *   This moves me off the wall.\n    *   From (8, 2), I could move UP to (8, 3), DOWN to (8, 1), LEFT to (7, 2), or RIGHT to (9, 2).\n    *   Let's check (8, 3). My body occupies (8, 3). So UP is blocked.\n    *   From (8, 2), I have 3 available directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n    *   This position offers more flexibility than (9, 1) which has only 2 available directions.\n\n**Comparison:**\n(9, 1) is safe but potentially restrictive. (8, 2) is safe and offers more immediate flexibility (3 exit paths vs 2).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n*   Head at (6, 0).\n*   Body occupies (6, 1), (6, 2), etc.\n*   The enemy is far away (distance 3 in x, 1 in y). He is not an immediate threat for collision this turn.\n*   However, if I go LEFT to (8, 2), I am moving closer to the center and the apples at (7, 0), (6, 0), etc., but I must be careful of my own tail.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to (8, 2) is the better move. It opens up the board to the left (x=7) and down (y=1), whereas DOWN to (9, 1) only opens up (9, 0) and (8, 1). (8, 2) allows me to navigate around the \"hole\" created by my body more effectively.\n\nLEFT",

If the enemy moves UP to (7, 1) and I am at (7, 2), I am directly above him. Next turn, I might be forced to move UP or LEFT/RIGHT. If the enemy moves UP again to (7, 2), I die. However, currently, the enemy is size 16 (long). He may not be able to move UP efficiently.\n        *   *Observation on Enemy Body:* The enemy body includes (6, 2), (6, 3)... If the enemy moves UP to (7, 1), his body moves from (6, 0) to (7, 0), (6, 1) to (6, 0), etc.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (8, 1):**\n        *   Pros: Moves towards the cluster of apples at (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0). (7, 0) is currently occupied by enemy head, but (8, 0) is empty.\n        *   Cons: Sticking to the right side (x=8).\n        *   Risk Analysis: If I move DOWN to (8, 1), the enemy (at 7, 0) will likely move UP to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (8, 0).\n            *   If Enemy moves UP (7, 1): Safe.\n            *   If Enemy moves RIGHT (8, 0): Safe. I am at (8, 1), he is at (8, 0). Adjacent but safe.\n        *   From (8, 1), I can eat the apple at (8, 0) next turn.\n        *   From (8, 1), I can move LEFT to (7, 1) only if the enemy isn't there.\n        *   *Wait, looking at the apples:* (8, 0) is an apple. (2, 0) is an apple. (0, 1) is an apple.\n        *   The enemy is at (7, 0). If he moves UP, (8, 0) is free for me to eat next turn.\n        *   If he moves RIGHT to (8, 0), he eats the apple and blocks me.\n        *   However, if he moves RIGHT to (8, 0), he moves into the wall. From (8, 0), his options next turn are UP (8, 1) or LEFT (7, 0). If he moves RIGHT to (8, 0) and I stay at (8, 1), he cannot hit me immediately next turn unless he moves UP into me (which would be a head-on collision if I move into him, or him into me).\n\n    *   **Comparing (8, 1) vs (7, 2):**\n        *   The board shows many apples in the left side (0-5 range). The right side (6-9) is mostly my body.\n        *   I am currently at (8, 2). My body occupies much of column 9 and parts of 8 and 7.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (7, 2) consumes a cell (7, 2). My body is already very crowded in the right-center.\n        *   Moving DOWN to (8, 1) frees up (8, 2). My body becomes [(8, 2), (9, 2)...].\n        *   Actually, checking my body again: [(9, 2), (9, 3) ...]. (8, 2) is currently empty (it's my head).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (8, 1), my tail moves from (9, 7) to (9, 6) (assuming I don't eat). My new body starts (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2)...\n        *   If I move LEFT to (7, 2), my new body starts (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)...\n        *   **Critical Constraint:** My body occupies (7, 3), (7, 4)... If I move LEFT to (7, 2), I am placing my head right above my own body at (7, 3).\n            *   Next turn from (7, 2), I cannot move DOWN to (7, 3) because it's my body.\n            *   This limits my future moves if I get trapped.\n        *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (7, 0).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (8, 1), I am safely away from the enemy's immediate UP move.\n            *   If I move LEFT to (7, 2), I am directly above where the enemy will likely move (7, 1).\n            *   If the enemy moves UP to (7, 1), I am at (7, 2). If the enemy continues moving UP in subsequent turns, he forces me to retreat or die.\n            *   Given the enemy has more apples (16 vs 14), I should play slightly safer to ensure survival, but I need apples to catch up.\n            *   (8, 1) gives me access to (8, 0) (an apple).\n            *   (7, 2) gives me access to (6, 2) (blocked by enemy body), (7, 1) (potential enemy spot), (8, 2) (my previous spot), (6, 2) (enemy body).\n\n    *   **Refined Decision:**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (8, 1) is the safer move. It keeps distance from the enemy's likely UP move.\n        *   From (8, 1), I can move to (8, 0) to eat an apple next turn.\n        *   From (8, 1), I can move LEFT to (7, 1) if the enemy moves away from there (e.g., moves RIGHT to 8,0).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (7, 2) puts me in a bottleneck (above my own body at 7,3) and directly in the path of the enemy's expansion upwards.\n\n    **Final Check:**\n    - Move DOWN to (8, 1).\n    - Is (8, 1) occupied by my body? No.\n    - Is it within bounds? Yes.\n    - Is it occupied by enemy body? No.\n    - Will it cause a head-on collision? Unlikely. Enemy is at (7, 0). He can't reach (8, 1) in one move.\n    - Future options: (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 1). Good flexibility.\n\n    **Plan:** Move DOWN to (8, 1). Prepare to eat the apple at (8, 0) next turn if the enemy moves away or dies.\n\nSTART LONG-TERM PLAN\nMove DOWN to (8, 1) to position for the apple at (8, 0) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake at (7, 0). From (8, 1), I will have options to move LEFT or DOWN next turn depending on the enemy's movement. I must avoid getting pinned against the wall or my own body.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nDOWN",

The enemy head is at (8,2); it cannot reach (8,0) in one turn (would need two moves: down to 8,1 then down to 8,0). So there is no immediate head-on risk this turn.\n- After eating at (8,0) I will grow (tail will not move this turn). From (8,0) I cannot go LEFT next turn (that would be into my neck), so my safe follow-ups will be UP (to 8,1, which could be contested if the enemy commits down next turn) or RIGHT (to 9,0), which is safe and keeps me out of immediate head-on range. Choosing RIGHT now keeps options open to take 9,0 then loop back along the bottom to contest the remaining bottom apples (2,0, 0,1, 2,1, 3,1) while preserving room to avoid the enemy as it moves down from the upper-right area.\n\nPotential enemy responses and contingency:\n- The enemy can move down to (8,1) next turn to threaten the bottom apples, but they cannot enter (8,0) the same turn I take it. If they head straight for (8,0) over two turns, I can avoid collision by not moving into (8,1) at the same time they move into it, or by continuing to 9,0 on my following move.\n- If the enemy tries to rush me and causes a head-on by moving into the same cell at the same time in a future turn, I will prioritize moves that avoid head-to-heads (prefer moving to 9,0 rather than into contested 8,1).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 34: RIGHT to (8,0) and eat the apple.\n- Turn 35: Prefer RIGHT to (9,0) (safe, keeps distance), then assess enemy approach. From there, either sweep back left along y=0 to collect 2,0 later, or use extra space to maneuver upward if the enemy threatens the bottom corridor.\n\nRIGHT",
