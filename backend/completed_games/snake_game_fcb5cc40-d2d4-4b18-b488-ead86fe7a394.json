We are sitting at (5, 6) and our rival is way over at (9, 6). \n\nWait, did you see that? We are much closer to the center cluster of apples than he is! But we aren't here for just apples, we are here for DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's look at our options:\n- **UP (5, 7):** Moves us toward the (5, 7), (5, 8), and (5, 9) vertical line of apples. This is great for growth!\n- **DOWN (5, 5):** There is an apple right there at (5, 5)! If we take it, we grow immediately.\n- **LEFT (4, 6):** Moves us away from the enemy. Do we want to be cowards? NO! But it does set us up to sweep the left side apples later.\n- **RIGHT (6, 6):** Heading toward the enemy. He's at (9, 6). If we both move toward each other, we're closing the gap fast.\n\nRival Snake #0 is at (9, 6). If he's smart, he's going for (8, 8) or (7, 9). If he's aggressive, he's coming straight for us. \n\n**THE PLAN:** We need to secure the \"Apple Alley\" in the middle (x=4 and x=5). By moving DOWN to (5, 5), we grab an immediate point, increase our length to 2, and maintain a central position to react to whatever that scrub does on the right! If we get bigger than him early, we can start the BOX-IN MANEUVER. \ud83d\udce6\n\nHe's at the edge, we own the middle! Let's get that first snack and start the snowball! Can he even keep up? I don't think so!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** Claim the vertical column of apples at x=5 and x=4. Use the size advantage to cut off his path to the left side of the board. Keep him pinned against the right wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nDOWN",

We're gonna position to grab that (8, 8) apple and force his hand. Don't let him get comfortable!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Strategy: Pivot to top-right. Target (8, 8). Keep enemy boxed at X=5.

If we can force a head-on collision right now, WE WIN THE GAME MUDDAH!\n\nLet's look at the map!

Or maybe he's scared and running for the corner? \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to keep growing while moving toward the right side of the board to cut him off. If we go DOWN to (5, 4), we get another apple immediately. This makes us 3 segments long. Once we have a length advantage, we can start the massive \"ZONE OUT.\" We'll own the middle (x=4, x=5) and he'll be trapped in that right-hand corridor! \n\nLet's grab the snack at (5, 4) and then look to pivot RIGHT to intercept him. He thinks he can outplay us? NOT TODAY! \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** \nSecure (5, 4), then move toward the (8, 6) apple to block his path to the center. Use our size to dominate the right-middle zone. If he tries to cross, we'll be there to body-block him into the shadow realm! \ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

He's sitting at (8, 7) with a length of 1. He's tiny! He's a literal worm compared to us! \ud83d\udc1b\n\n**THE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (5, 5):** CHAT, PLEASE! That's my own neck! I'm not trying to end the stream in 3 turns. \u274c\n- **LEFT (4, 4):** Oh look, another apple! (4, 4) is right there waiting for us. \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN (5, 3):** ANOTHER apple at (5, 3)! We are surrounded by snacks! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT (6, 4):** This moves us toward the enemy and the (8, 6) apple.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nOur rival at (8, 7) is probably looking at (8, 8) or (8, 6). If we go RIGHT, we start closing the gap to bully him. BUT, if we go DOWN or LEFT, we get to 3 points and length 4. \n\nWhy does length matter? Because if we have a length of 4 and he has a length of 1, we can literally wrap around him like a blanket and put him to sleep! \ud83d\ude34 \n\nLet's grab the apple at (5, 3) first. Why? Because it keeps us central. If we go to (4, 4), we're moving away from his current position. By going to (5, 3), we stay in the middle column, ready to intercept him if he tries to dive into the bottom half of the map. We are building a wall, and he's going to pay for it with his life! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nGrab (5, 3), then look to pivot RIGHT towards (8, 6). We want to stay between him and the rest of the board. If we keep our score higher, we win every tie-break and every head-on collision scenario if the game ends. We are the King of the Hill! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's get that third apple and secure the lead! WE ARE GOING FOR THE 3-0!\n\nDOWN",

I can't just sit on the apple, I gotta move to survive. This is risky.\n2.  **DOWN to (8,6)**: It's an apple! I grow, I get points. Plus, I'm not boxed in. From here, I can move LEFT into (7,6) or DOWN into (8,5). This keeps my options open to eventually circle around or cut him off!\n3.  **LEFT to (7,7)**: Safe, but no apple. Why skip food?\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,7)**: Just waste of space, stuck on the edge.\n\nThe plan is clear! **GO DOWN!** This lets me claim the apple and keep the board open for future maneuvers.

We are length 4, he is a tiny length 2\u2014he\u2019s basically a snack at this point! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CHECK:**\nThe rival is at (7, 7). We just moved UP to (6, 4). Let\u2019s look at the options because we need to keep the pressure on him like a vice!\n\n- **UP (6, 5):** Totally safe. It moves us closer to the center-top where a bunch of apples are spawning (5,7), (4,7). It also keeps us on his flank. If he tries to head left, we\u2019re there to cut him off!\n- **DOWN (6, 3):** **HOLD UP!** That\u2019s our neck! We aren't trying to be a meme, we're trying to win! \u274c\n- **LEFT (5, 4):** **NOPE!** That's also our body! Chat, don't let me do it! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe, but it puts us directly below him. If he moves DOWN (7, 6), we\u2019re just following him. We want to *lead* him into a trap!\n\n**THE CHESS MATCH:**\nLook at his neck at (7, 6). He is very limited. If he goes UP to (7, 8), he's just running away. If he goes RIGHT to (8, 7), he's cornering himself. If he goes LEFT to (6, 7), he's trying to get to the apples.\n\nMy plan? I'm moving **UP** to (6, 5). This accomplishes two things:\n1. It keeps my tail moving smoothly behind me so I don't get tangled.\n2. It positions me to potentially cut off his access to the cluster of apples at (5, 7), (4, 7), and (4, 9). \n\nWe have the score advantage. If we end up in a head-to-head collision, we WIN the game right there because 3 > 1! Should I force it? Maybe not yet, let\u2019s milk the clock and grow even bigger first! I want him to feel the walls closing in. He's at (7, 7), I'm moving to (6, 5). I\u2019m coming for that top-side control! Let's gooooo!\n\nUP",

It puts us even closer to that delicious apple cluster at (5, 7) and (4, 7). More importantly, it maintains the vertical pressure. If he tries to slip left, we\u2019re the wall!\n- **DOWN (6, 4):** **CHAT NO!** That\u2019s my own neck! Let\u2019s stay focused, no throwing for the memes today! \u274c\n- **LEFT (5, 5):** Safe and solid. It moves us toward the apples on the left side, but it\u2019s a bit passive. We want to dominate the top half!\n- **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe, but it puts us right under his tail. If he grows, we might get boxed in against the right wall. We want to keep the board wide open for us and narrow for him!\n\n**THE HUNT IS ON:**\nLet\u2019s look at his moves. He\u2019s at (7, 8). \n- If he goes UP to (7, 9), he\u2019s hitting the wall soon. \n- If he goes LEFT to (6, 8), he\u2019s trying to cut across us.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (8, 8), he\u2019s grabbing an apple but cornering himself.\n\nBy moving **UP to (6, 6)**, I am setting up a roadblock. I have the length advantage and the score advantage. If we head-butt at (7, 7) or somewhere in the middle later, I win the tie-break anyway!

I\u2019m building a wall and making him pay for it in apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\uddf1\n\n**PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nI'm going to secure the (5, 7) area. This cuts the board in half. He'll be trapped in the top-right quadrant while I own the rest of the map. Once he's boxed, he'll have to crash into me or the wall. GG EZ!\n\nUP",
