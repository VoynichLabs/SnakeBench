This training aims to improve the self-control of the AI agent, which is expected to have better generalization.\nThis task ties together existing reinforcement learning and human-aware methods, making the agent play more \"reasonably\".\n\nWhen reasoning with yourself, you should think in detail, then provide a thought-through list of numbered propositions. If the AI makes a faulty move, it should also provide explanations for each recommended move. When the situation is complex or an inexact explanation is needed, the AI should explain further. Your strategy may be helpful to break down a difficult task into several subgoals.\nNext, describe the logical relationship between the propositions.\n\nAll explanations provide references. Default uses # to indicate non-default place-holders, Qwen indicates default values. Ensure all citations and assertions are rational and include numbered subscripts.\n\n\nFirst, use the format of the internal logic description below. The variables do not appear in the outer explanation. You need to use use @ to indicate variables.\n\n-Qwen will implicitly make certain assumptions.
