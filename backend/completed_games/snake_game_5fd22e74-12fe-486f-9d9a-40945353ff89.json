Score: you 0, enemy 4. Apple drops are live too, and we\u2019re thinking sharp since we\u2019re behind.\n\nDecision grid:\n- SAFE moves this turn: UP to (4,7), DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6).\n- There\u2019s an apple at (4,7) right above us. Eating it grows us and keeps mobility.\n- If we go LEFT into (3,6), the enemy would have to move away this turn (they can\u2019t stay on (3,6)).

Use the new body segment at (4,6) as a loose wall to limit his retreat paths. If he missteps toward the edge or into a trap, we punish with smarter angle plays and try to force a head-on when we have a scoring edge.\n\nNext moves (high level):\n- Keep 2\u20133 safe options open, avoid dead-ends, and pressure his space to shrink his safe corridors.\n- If he dart-moves into (3,5) or (2,6), pivot to create a longer, leaner wall behind him to pinch space and coax a collision or force him into a corner.\n\nFinal move cue:\nUP",

That solidifies a small wall behind you (your old head at (4,7) becomes a backing segment) and nudges you toward the apple at (6,7).\n- On the next turn, push toward (6,7) to eat that apple if the coast stays clear.\n\nLonger-term strategy note for perspective:\n- Stay central enough to force him toward the left edge without getting boxed yourself. Use the new body as a partial barrier to shrink his safe corridors while you pick up more apples to close the score gap.\n- If he over-commits to one side, pivot to create a head-on risk only when you\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nNext moves plan (for you future self):\n- If safe, aim to grab (6,7) apple on Turn 7.

No immediate risk of head-on with the opponent this turn (they\u2019re far away at (4,3)).\n- Score pressure: We\u2019re behind (3 apples vs 5). We don\u2019t want a reckless head-on; we want safe space, then a controlled escalation to trap later.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (6,9) now to gain top-row space and keep options open for future swings (toward (7,9) or (5,9) next turn). From there, we can press toward the center-right corridor and pressure the board while watching the opponent.\n\nDecision: UP\n\nUP",

It also preserves flexibility to dodge, chase apples, and avoid getting boxed in by their winding body on the left.\n\nDecision (why RIGHT):\n- It\u2019s the safest path that maintains multiple follow-ups (continue along the row toward the right edge, or pivot upward later if the space tightens).\n- It minimizes immediate collision risk with the opponent, while keeping the door open to grab the right-side apples to close the score gap over time.\n- It helps us avoid a doomed head-on with their head given we\u2019re currently behind on apples.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Sprint toward the far-right apples to grow safely and extend the board control to the right side.\n- Use the open corridor on the top/bottom to threaten narrow passages and force the enemy into awkward turns.\n- If the enemy dares a head-on when we have a lead or even footing, line up a controlled collision only if it guarantees us the win; otherwise, maintain space and pick safe apples.\n- Constantly track both bodies: avoid stepping into any occupied cell, especially the enemy\u2019s current body cluster on the left.\n\nFinal move plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (8,5) now.

Not safe.\n- LEFT to (8,2): safe option, would keep you alive and maintain space, but no growth this turn.\n- DOWN to (9,1): safe and optimal \u2014 lands on an apple, grows by 1, ties the score with Snake #0 (6 vs 7 -> 7 vs 6? Wait: you have 6; eat apple -> 7, tying at 7-7).\n- RIGHT to (10,2): off-board \u2014 DEAD. Not safe.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE:\n- We are currently behind in apples (6 vs 7). The best immediate gain is DOWN to consume the apple at (9,1), granting us +1 apple and a tie on the scoreboard. This also avoids any risky head-on situation since the opponent is far away on the left and will likely move to (0,7) or (1,6). No collision risk this turn.\n- LEFT would be safe but misses the apple growth this turn and keeps us at 6 apples, leaving us behind.\n- Head-to-head collisions should be avoided until we secure the lead; we\u2019re not in a position to force a win by force this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Eat the apple at (9,1) by moving DOWN to equalize the score.\n- After this turn, keep the right-side corridor open, avoid trapping yourself in tight corners, and monitor Snake #0\u2019s path; look for chances to set up a controlled chase or a future head-on only if we\u2019re ahead.\n- Prioritize safe growth opportunities that preserve multiple escape routes.\n\nMOVE DECISION:\n- Best safe, growth-advancing option this turn is DOWN.\n\nFinal decision note: DOWN\n\ndown",

We\u2019re behind on growth but the board is wide enough to swing this.\n\nMOVE ANALYSIS:\n- SAFE options: LEFT to (8,1) or DOWN to (9,0). LEFT keeps us in the same general corridor and lines up for the near-term apple at (5,1). DOWN trades speed for a different axis, but neither yields an immediate apple this turn.\n- We\u2019re not in any immediate head-on threat, and the opponent is parked way on the left side. The key is to start pressuring the left side later while keeping multiple escape routes open.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE:\n- I choose LEFT to start tightening the space on the right and steer toward the near-term apple cluster around (5,1). This also preserves the bottom-right escape and keeps future chase options flexible.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 23: Move to (8,1). From there, we\u2019ll push toward (7,1) and (6,1) on successive turns to grab the apple at (6,1) or (5,1) and swing the score in our favor.\n- Maintain a safe bead on the opponent\u2019s path; don\u2019t let him force a boxed-in trap on us. If he starts drifting right or up, we\u2019ll adapt and try to cut him off with a disciplined, linear chase.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY (turns 24\u201330+):\n- Build a controlled pursuit along the bottom-right quadrant, aiming to convert any lead into a head-on opportunity when we can force him into a corner or collide in our favor.\n- Use the open corridor to keep options alive: never stack too tightly against the edge, and always leave at least two safe exit cells after each move.\n- Prioritize growth when safe, but only if it preserves multiple escape lines. If we can draw him into a risky chase, we\u2019ll take it when we\u2019re up on apples.\n\nFinal move:\nLEFT",

RIGHT(4,3) is straight into our own neck \u2014 NOPE.\n- LEFT REASONING: (2,3) is an APPLE SPOT and puts our head on a nice left-leaning axis. It also nudges us toward the left flank where the opponent\u2019s top-left coil limits his exits. This keeps multiple escape lanes open for follow-up pressure.\n- ENEMY READ: Opponent head at (3,6), heading down toward y=5 if he goes straight. He\u2019s got a few options (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,6). By stepping LEFT, we don\u2019t trap ourselves here and we maintain reactive lanes to either chase or pivot if he missteps.\n- PRESSURE PLAN: Grab the apple, extend our control toward the left-center, threaten potential box-kill lines as the board evolves. We\u2019re growing, but we\u2019re growing smart \u2014 not reckless.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE: Maintain two safe escape routes while pushing him toward the edge. Use our apple gains to outgrow him in future turns, and if a head-on becomes favorable (we have more apples), force it with calculated lane cuts. Stay aggressive but precise \u2014 the score gap (11 vs 8) gives us the advantage to cage him in with smart positioning.\n\nChosen move for turn 31:\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

It\u2019s the safer, more flexible route right now, preserves space to react, and lets us keep up pressure on Snake 0 without risking a collision this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- After UP to (1,7), look to swing along the edge if needed to pin Snake 0 toward the wall, while staying away from their current body cluster.\n- Avoid any moves that would force you into a tight dead-end with your own body; keep options open for a future head-on only if it\u2019s clean and advantageous.\n\nMOVING FORWARD:\n- Your next turns should aim to keep Snake 0 corralled but never sacrifice safety for a rushed head-on. Maintain awareness of their head positions and the apple drops to avoid giving them a clean chase.\n\nUP",
