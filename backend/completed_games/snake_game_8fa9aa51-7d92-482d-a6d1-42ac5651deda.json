At row 6, column 4, the cell is empty (there\u2019s an apple at (5,6) on that row, but not in our current column).\n\u2013 RIGHT is (5,5), which is also free but a bit closer to the enemy snake (the enemy head is at (6,5)).\n\u2013 DOWN is (4,4), which is occupied by our own body.\n\u2013 LEFT is (3,5), and while that\u2019s free, it doesn\u2019t lead us immediately toward any apple.\n\nGoing UP toward (4,6) sets us up nicely to reach the apple at (4,7) in our next move. This vertical path is straightforward and safe, keeping our snake away from both our own body and the enemy snake. \n\nThus, my planned next move is: UP."

It's empty on the board and no snake part there, so safe.\n\nSummary:\n\n- UP to (7,5): Safe, slightly moves towards cluster of apples.\n\n- LEFT to (6,4): Safe, moves closer to apples (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n- RIGHT to (8,4): Safe, but moves away from apple cluster.\n\n- DOWN to (7,3) is forbidden (body).\n\nAmong these, moving LEFT (6,4) seems most promising. It's moving closer toward the cluster of apples at (4,4) and (4,5), which is a priority. Also, going LEFT keeps us from just circling higher and away from apples.\n\nIs moving LEFT onto (6,4) safe in terms of avoiding collision with the enemy or self? No snake parts or apples there and (6,4) is inside the board.\n\nIs there any risk of getting trapped or boxed in? Not immediately, as from (6,4) we can further go LEFT or DOWN toward apples.\n\nSo LEFT seems better.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,5) is also safe and could approach apples, but slightly less direct.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, choosing LEFT gives a more direct approach.\n\nHence, **I will move LEFT next**.\n\nStrategy next turn: Continue towards the cluster of apples by moving further left and possibly down to get the apple at (5,3). Also keep an eye on enemy snake to avoid collision.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

Also, going LEFT keeps us from just circling higher and away from apples.\n\nIs moving LEFT onto (6,4) safe in terms of avoiding collision with the enemy or self? No snake parts or apples there and (6,4) is inside the board.\n\nIs there any risk of getting trapped or boxed in? Not immediately, as from (6,4) we can further go LEFT or DOWN toward apples.\n\nSo LEFT seems better.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,5) is also safe and could approach apples, but slightly less direct.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, choosing LEFT gives a more direct approach.\n\nHence, **I will move LEFT next**.\n\nStrategy next turn: Continue towards the cluster of apples by moving further left and possibly down to get the apple at (5,3). Also keep an eye on enemy snake to avoid collision.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**"

The last move info says your head used to be at (5,9), but after moving DOWN your head is (5,8), so (5,9) is free?  \n- But board shows (5,9) as T (enemy body segment) in the original board? No, T\u2019s are at (4,9), (3,9), (2,9)\u2026(1,9). So (5,9) is shown free.  \n- But, after your last move DOWN, your body would be updated to:  \n  Head: (5,8)  \n  Next: (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7) because the snake moves forward\u2014the tail moves forward and last tail segment is dropped unless the snake just ate an apple.  \n- That suggests (5,9) is occupied by your body now, so UP is moving into your own body.\n\n**Checking DOWN to (5,7):**  \n- Your body list includes (5,7). So no.\n\n**LEFT (4,8):**  \n- Board shows a T, enemy body, no.\n\n**RIGHT (6,8):**  \n- Your body at (6,8), no good.\n\nNo safe moves? That can\u2019t be.\n\nWait, so last move, you moved DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8), so your body must have shifted accordingly.\n\nIf you moved DOWN without eating an apple, your tail gets removed, so your tail is now no longer at (5,6) (assuming no apple growth), freeing that space.\n\nTherefore, the body now is:  \nHead: (5,8)  \nBody: (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)  \nTail at (5,6) is removed.\n\nSo positions occupied: (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7).\n\nAvailable moves with these positions blocked:\n\n- UP (5,9): occupied  \n- DOWN (5,7): occupied  \n- LEFT (4,8): enemy snake body (blocked)  \n- RIGHT (6,8): occupied.\n\nHence, no safe moves.\n\nIs it possible the body positions mistaken?\n\nMaybe the tail is at (5,6) and should have moved forward.\n\nFrom initial body before last move:  \n[(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]\n\nHead at (5,9)\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,8), the new body should be:\n\nHead (5,8)  \nThen old head (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)\n\nTail (5,7) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSo new body at: [(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]; tail actually is (5,7).\n\nSo moving DOWN does not drop tail at (5,7) because the snake didn't grow.\n\nSo all those positions still occupied.\n\nBut from the original board text, at (4,8) is 'T'.\n\nIs it possible to move LEFT or RIGHT?\n\nNo, both occupied or blocked.\n\nNo movement possible leads to death? The snake is trapped. But the initial instructions said last move was DOWN and END at (5,8) so this must be accurate.\n\n**Assuming no mistake, no safe move.**\n\nHmm.\n\nIf no safe moves, then perhaps the snake is trapped for the moment.\n\nIs that possible or did I miss a detail?\n\nIs there an alternative to try?\n\nGiven this predicament, let's consider that the tail at (5,7) will be freed after this move.\n\nThat is, on moving, the tail moves forward and vacates the last position (5,7) at the same time the head moves forward to the new location.\n\nTherefore, positions occupied after your previous move:\n\nBody segments: (5,8) head, then (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7) tail\n\nOn next move:\n\n- If you move UP to (5,9): occupied  \n- If DOWN to (5,7): occupied but tail vacates (5,7) simultaneously  \n- So moving DOWN to (5,7) may be valid if the tail moves forward (unless apple eaten).\n\nThis is common logic in snake games \u2014 moving onto your tail position is allowed if the tail moves out on the same turn.\n\nSo moving down to (5,7) is allowed if the tail is at (5,7) and vacates.\n\nHence, DOWN is possible to (5,7).\n\nOk, check if (5,7) is at the tail position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is valid.\n\n**Check for risk at (5,7):**\n\nIs occupant under your control? Yes, tail moves on next turn away.\n\nNo enemy at (5,7), so safe.\n\nSo available moves are:\n\n- DOWN: (5,7) tail position, allowed.  \n- UP: (5,9) body. no  \n- LEFT: (4,8) enemy body. no  \n- RIGHT: (6,8) body no.\n\nHence, DOWN is the only valid safe move.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\n\nMoving DOWN brings you closer to apple at (5,3), directly below.\n\nSo plan proceeds as before.\n\n**Final decision:** Move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move selection:**\n\nDOWN"

So no.\n\n**LEFT (4,8):**  \n- Board shows a T, enemy body, no.\n\n**RIGHT (6,8):**  \n- Your body at (6,8), no good.\n\nNo safe moves? That can\u2019t be.\n\nWait, so last move, you moved DOWN from (5,9) to (5,8), so your body must have shifted accordingly.\n\nIf you moved DOWN without eating an apple, your tail gets removed, so your tail is now no longer at (5,6) (assuming no apple growth), freeing that space.\n\nTherefore, the body now is:  \nHead: (5,8)  \nBody: (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)  \nTail at (5,6) is removed.\n\nSo positions occupied: (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7).\n\nAvailable moves with these positions blocked:\n\n- UP (5,9): occupied  \n- DOWN (5,7): occupied  \n- LEFT (4,8): enemy snake body (blocked)  \n- RIGHT (6,8): occupied.\n\nHence, no safe moves.\n\nIs it possible the body positions mistaken?\n\nMaybe the tail is at (5,6) and should have moved forward.\n\nFrom initial body before last move:  \n[(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]\n\nHead at (5,9)\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,8), the new body should be:\n\nHead (5,8)  \nThen old head (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)\n\nTail (5,7) is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSo new body at: [(5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7)]; tail actually is (5,7).\n\nSo moving DOWN does not drop tail at (5,7) because the snake didn't grow.\n\nSo all those positions still occupied.\n\nBut from the original board text, at (4,8) is 'T'.\n\nIs it possible to move LEFT or RIGHT?\n\nNo, both occupied or blocked.\n\nNo movement possible leads to death? The snake is trapped. But the initial instructions said last move was DOWN and END at (5,8) so this must be accurate.\n\n**Assuming no mistake, no safe move.**\n\nHmm.\n\nIf no safe moves, then perhaps the snake is trapped for the moment.\n\nIs that possible or did I miss a detail?\n\nIs there an alternative to try?\n\nGiven this predicament, let's consider that the tail at (5,7) will be freed after this move.\n\nThat is, on moving, the tail moves forward and vacates the last position (5,7) at the same time the head moves forward to the new location.\n\nTherefore, positions occupied after your previous move:\n\nBody segments: (5,8) head, then (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7) tail\n\nOn next move:\n\n- If you move UP to (5,9): occupied  \n- If DOWN to (5,7): occupied but tail vacates (5,7) simultaneously  \n- So moving DOWN to (5,7) may be valid if the tail moves forward (unless apple eaten).\n\nThis is common logic in snake games \u2014 moving onto your tail position is allowed if the tail moves out on the same turn.\n\nSo moving down to (5,7) is allowed if the tail is at (5,7) and vacates.\n\nHence, DOWN is possible to (5,7).\n\nOk, check if (5,7) is at the tail position? Yes.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is valid.\n\n**Check for risk at (5,7):**\n\nIs occupant under your control? Yes, tail moves on next turn away.\n\nNo enemy at (5,7), so safe.\n\nSo available moves are:\n\n- DOWN: (5,7) tail position, allowed.  \n- UP: (5,9) body. no  \n- LEFT: (4,8) enemy body. no  \n- RIGHT: (6,8) body no.\n\nHence, DOWN is the only valid safe move.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\n\nMoving DOWN brings you closer to apple at (5,3), directly below.\n\nSo plan proceeds as before.\n\n**Final decision:** Move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move selection:**\n\nDOWN"
