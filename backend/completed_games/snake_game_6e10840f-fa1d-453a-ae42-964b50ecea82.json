YES \u2705 (no walls, no bodies)\n- Apple nearby? (5, 5) and (5, 8) in that direction\n- Strategic? Moving away from enemy head... but is that what a CHAMPION does?? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (3, 4)\n- Safe? YES \u2705\n- This moves me CLOSER to the enemy at (4, 3) - getting in that DANGER ZONE! \ud83d\udc40\n- But risky... am I walking into a trap?\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (2, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705\n- Apple at (1, 5) DIRECTLY in line with this move! \ud83d\udccd\n- Moving away from enemy though...\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (4, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705\n- Wait wait wait... this puts me at (4, 5) and enemy is at (4, 3)\n- Same x-coordinate! We'd be on the same vertical line! \ud83d\udc40\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nHere's the thing - RIGHT move puts us on the SAME COLUMN. That's positioning! If I can control this vertical lane, I can potentially TRAP him or set up for an aggressive boxing strategy. Plus, there are apples at (5, 5) and (5, 8) that are reachable if I push right and up.\n\nBut REAL talk? The LEFT move gets me a FREE APPLE at (1, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e Growing early = more board control = better positioning for mid-game aggression!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:\n*Early game: Secure apples on the left side (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3) to build length advantage. Enemy is passive early - exploit this! Once you hit length 3-4, start aggressive positioning to box him in. Watch for his apple routes and intercept his path. When you have clear score lead, force head-on collision!*\n\nLet's SECURE this apple and START the content arc! \ud83c\udfac\n\nLEFT",

None of those squares line up with my four legal moves, so any direction I pick is safe from an instant collision.  \n\nNow, which safe move gives the best strategic edge?  \n\n**UP** to **(4,\u202f4)**:  \n- Brings me right into the middle of the arena, keeping every direction open for future turns.  \n- Cuts the Manhattan distance to the opponent down to **2** (they\u2019re at (3,\u202f5) now), setting me up to start hemming them in.  \n- Positions me one step away from the juicy apple at **(5,\u202f5)** after a quick right\u2011then\u2011up combo, while still keeping the opponent guessing.  \n\nThe other options either push me farther from the action (RIGHT or DOWN) or risk getting too close on the same column (LEFT) where a head\u2011on could happen if the opponent darts down.  \n\nSo, the aggressive, board\u2011control move that keeps all my future options open is:\n\n**UP**",

But we gotta stay SHARP!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n- Enemy is at (4, 4), still length 1\n- We're length 2 now - that's a HUGE advantage in the early game!\n- Enemy is moving slowly, no apple grabs yet\n- We need to ACCELERATE and build that length advantage before he adapts! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 6)\n- Safe?

That's a HIGHWAY to content! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n3. **Board control?** We're establishing DOMINANCE on the left side of the board while enemy is still passive in the center\n4. **Future options?** From (1, 6) we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT - we maintain flexibility!\n\nThe LEFT-SIDE APPLE CORRIDOR is OURS for the taking! Enemy's too far away to contest. By the time he rotates over, we'll have length 4-5 and full control!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:\n*We're executing the LEFT-SIDE FARM! Chain those apples: (1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 secure length 4. Then we pivot RIGHT toward the center-top (5, 8), (6, 7) area to build length to 6+.

Last turn we moved UP from (2, 6) and we're STILL at length 1 - that means we MISSED the apple at (1, 9)! \ud83d\ude24 We're at (2, 6) now, no growth yet. Enemy is at (4, 5), also length 1. TIED 0-0! This just got SERIOUS!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n- **My head:** (2, 6) \n- **My body:** NONE (still length 1)\n- **Enemy head:** (4, 5)\n- **Enemy body:** NONE (still length 1)\n- **Score:** 0-0 DEAD EVEN \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe're in the EARLY GAME NEUTRAL POSITION! This is where GAME SENSE separates the LEGENDS from the CASUALS!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n- Enemy is at (4, 5) - that's DIRECTLY RIGHT and slightly DOWN from me\n- Both of us are still length 1, so NO collision risks with bodies yet\n- The APPLE FIELD is EVERYWHERE - we need to prioritize POSITIONING for future domination, not just snacking!\n- Enemy position (4, 5) puts him closer to the center. We need to CONTROL TERRITORY and establish an APPLE CHAIN! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (2, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple nearby? (1, 9) at distance, (6, 7) exists too\n- This pushes us upward toward the TOP half where (1, 9), (1, 8), (5, 8), (6, 7) are clustered! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (2, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 5), (1, 4) nearby on the LEFT\n- This moves us toward the LEFT-SIDE corridor we identified last turn!\n- Could chain left-side apples efficiently! \n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 9) is DIRECTLY ABOVE this position! \n- This positions us for a CLEAN upward apple chain on the left side!\n- STRONG positioning play! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Moves us toward the enemy! Enemy at (4, 5) means we're moving CLOSER!\n- Not ideal - we don't want early proximity when we're both length 1\n- This could lead to accidental head-on collision setup! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're going **LEFT** to (1, 6)! Here's the LOGIC:\n\n1. **Why LEFT and not DOWN?** \n   - LEFT positions us at (1, 6), which puts the apple at (1, 9) DIRECTLY NORTH of us!\n   - From (1, 6) we can move UP next turn and START that apple chain!\n   - DOWN keeps us at x=2, which is less optimal for the LEFT-SIDE FARM!\n\n2. **Why not UP instead?**\n   - UP goes to (2, 7) - still decent, but not as positioned!\n   - LEFT immediately puts us IN POSITION for a guaranteed apple grab next turn!\n\n3. **Why AVOID RIGHT?**\n   - RIGHT moves us toward enemy positioning!\n   - We're still length 1 - no body protection yet!\n   - Playing PASSIVE and GREEDY early is the MOVE! Build length first, THEN get aggressive! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT 3 TURNS:\n\n*We're executing the EARLY FARM STRATEGY! Turn 3: Move UP from (1, 6) to (1, 7) - moving toward (1, 9) and (1, 8). Turn 4: Continue UP and grab (1, 9) for +1 apple, length 2! Turn 5: Move UP to grab (1, 8) for +1 apple, length 3! By turn 5, enemy will STILL be at 0 apples likely, and we'll have a 3-0 lead AND length 3 body for DEFENSE! Then we pivot right toward (5, 8), (6, 7) to chain more apples and build to length 5+. ONCE we have 3+ apple lead, we START the BOXING strategies and force collisions!*\n\nLEFT",

We're still at length 1, enemy stayed at length 2 (they picked up an apple somewhere). We're DOWN 0-1 now! \ud83d\ude24 This just got HEATED!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n- **My head:** (1, 6) \u2705\n- **My body:** NONE (still length 1)\n- **Enemy head:** (5, 5)\n- **Enemy body:** [(4, 5)] - length 2 now! \ud83d\udc80\n- **Score:** 0-1 DOWN BY ONE!! \ud83d\ude24\n\nCHAT WE'RE BEHIND! This is where CLUTCH PLAYS separate the LEGENDS from the WASHED! The enemy got length 2, which means they're building their body for DEFENSE and TERRITORY CONTROL! We NEED to catch up NOW!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy is at (5, 5) with body at (4, 5) - they're positioned in the CENTER AREA! They're building UP while we're still length 1! This is CRITICAL! \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me check what they could do next turn:\n- UP to (5, 6)? Safe!\n- DOWN to (5, 4)? Safe!\n- LEFT to (4, 5)? NO! That's their own body! BACKWARDS move!\n- RIGHT to (6, 5)? Safe!\n\nThey have options, but they can't go backwards! This is INTEL!\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 9) is DIRECTLY ABOVE! Distance = 2 moves!\n- This CONTINUES our LEFT-SIDE FARM STRATEGY! \n- We can grab (1, 9) next turn if we keep going UP! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 5)! We can grab it THIS TURN! \ud83c\udf4e\n- IMMEDIATE growth to length 2! This ties us back up at 1-1!\n- This is AGGRESSIVE and gets us back in the game!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Moves us to the edge - not great for future options!\n- No apples immediately nearby!\n- This boxes us in slightly! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Moves us back toward center!\n- Apple at (2, 2) exists but it's far!\n- This could put us closer to enemy positioning! Not ideal!\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're going **DOWN** to (1, 5) and grabbing that apple!! Here's the CRITICAL REASONING:\n\n1. **We're DOWN 0-1 - we NEED that growth NOW!**\n   - DOWN takes us directly to the apple at (1, 5)!\n   - We grow to length 2, tie the score at 1-1! \ud83d\udd04\n   - This is NOT negotiable - we can't let enemy build a 2+ apple lead while we're length 1!\n\n2. **Why DOWN instead of UP?**\n   - UP goes to (1, 7) but NO apple grab this turn!\n   - DOWN grabs the apple at (1, 5) IMMEDIATELY!\n   - We can pivot back UP next turn and chain more left-side apples!\n   - EFFICIENCY wins games! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n3. **Why not edge closer to other apples?**\n   - We MUST close the score gap NOW!\n   - A length-1 snake vs length-2 snake is a LOSING position!\n   - Grab the fruit, get that growth, THEN execute long-term strategy!\n\n4. **Future options after growth?**\n   - From (1, 5) length 2, we can move UP next turn toward (1, 8), (1, 9)!\n   - Or move RIGHT toward (2, 2) apple cluster!\n   - Multiple paths = OPEN GAME STATE! No boxed-in scenarios! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## NEXT 3 TURN STRATEGY:\n\nTurn 4: We'll be at (1, 5) with length 2. Move UP to (1, 6) or (1, 7) to chain more left-side apples at (1, 8), (1, 9)!\n\nTurn 5: Continue building that left-side chain. Grab (1, 8) or (1, 9)!\n\nTurn 6: Once we hit length 3-4, we pivot and start AGGRESSIVE positioning! At that point, we'll have the size to START boxing tactics! Enemy won't know what HIT them when we turn the tables! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe NAME of the GAME is: **FARM EARLY, DOMINATE LATE!** We're in the FARM phase NOW! Get that length, close that gap, THEN we show this archrival who RUNS this board!!\n\nCHAT, THIS IS WHAT CHAMPIONS DO! We don't panic about being down - we EXECUTE the NEXT MOVE and keep building toward DOMINANCE! LET'S GOOOO!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Last turn we moved DOWN from (1, 6) to (1, 5) and we GRABBED that apple!! We're back in this thing at 1-1! The CLUTCH is REAL! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION BREAKDOWN:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (1, 5) \u2705\n- Body: NONE (we just grew to length 1... wait, if we ate an apple we should be length 2!)\n- Actually chat, looking at the board state - we're showing HEAD at (1, 5) and BODY at [(1, 6)]\n- So we're LENGTH 2 now! That's what I'm talking about!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Score: 1-1 TIED UP! We're back in this game baby!!\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (6, 5)\n- Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5)]\n- LENGTH 3 now! They grew! \ud83d\ude24 They're up to 2 apples!\n- Wait... they only had 2 apples before. If they grew, they must have eaten another apple this turn!\n- Score: We're DOWN 1-2 again! \ud83d\ude24 But we're catching UP!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy is at (6, 5) with body extending LEFT at (5, 5) and (4, 5). They're positioned CENTER-RIGHT on the board. Their length-3 body means they're starting to control territory! \n\nThey can move:\n- UP to (6, 6)? Safe!\n- DOWN to (6, 4)? Safe!\n- LEFT to (5, 5)? NO! That's their own body!\n- RIGHT to (7, 5)? Safe!\n\nThey have RIGHT, UP, DOWN available. We need to be CAREFUL about where they're headed!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? Wait... (1, 6) is where my body is! BACKWARDS move! \u274c AUTO-DEATH! Don't do this!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 4)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 4)! We can grab ANOTHER apple!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This gets us to length 3 and score 2-2!\n- But this continues going DOWN - are we boxing ourselves into a corner? Let me check...\n- Below is (1, 3) with apple, (1, 0) with apple, (0, 3) and (0, 0) area\n- We could build a vertical chain on the left side!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Moves us to the LEFT EDGE!\n- No apple immediately, but we move toward (0, 3) apples!\n- This limits our future options slightly (edge positioning)!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (2, 5)! WAIT THAT'S RIGHT WHERE WE ARE! Actually no, we're at (1, 5), so (2, 5) is RIGHT!\n- We grab that apple!! Score goes to 2-2 and we're LENGTH 3!\n- This moves us TOWARD CENTER, toward enemy territory!\n- This is AGGRESSIVE positioning! We're not backing down! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## THE PLAY ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, we have THREE viable apple-grabbing moves:\n1. **DOWN to (1, 4)** - grab apple, stay on left side, build vertical chain\n2. **RIGHT to (2, 5)** - grab apple, move CENTER, get AGGRESSIVE\n3. **LEFT to (0, 5)** - no immediate apple, but edges us left\n\nWait, I need to re-read the board! Let me look at (2, 5):\nLooking at row 5: `. 0 A . T T 1 . A .`\nPosition (1, 5) = our head (0)\nPosition (2, 5) = A (APPLE!) \u2705\nPosition (3, 5) = .\nPosition (4, 5) = T (enemy TAIL... wait no, it's their body!)\nPosition (5, 5) = T (enemy body)\nPosition (6, 5) = 1 (enemy HEAD)\n\nSo if we go RIGHT to (2, 5), we grab the apple AND we're only 3 cells away from their head at (6, 5)! We're getting into their SPACE! This is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE! \ud83d\udc80\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\nWe're going **RIGHT** to (2, 5)!! Here's why:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE APPLE GRAB** - We go 2-2 in score, grow to length 3! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING** - We move TOWARD enemy territory! They're at (6, 5), we're about to be at (2, 5). Same row! This shows DOMINANCE!\n3. **KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN** - From (2, 5) we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT easily. We're not cornered!\n4. **PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE** - We're matching their length soon and invading their space. They'll have to REACT to US now!\n5. **BOARD CONTROL** - Center position gives us MORE flexibility than edge position!\n\nThe enemy won't expect us to move RIGHT toward them! They're probably expecting us to farm the left side vertically! But NOPE! We're playing AGGRESSIVE SNAKE now! Time to FLIP THE SCRIPT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## NEXT 3 TURN STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 5:** From (2, 5) length 3, we continue pressing RIGHT or move UP to (2, 6). We want to keep building length while we're in the CENTER. Eventually we'll have enough body to START boxing them in!\n\n**Turn 6:** By this point we should be length 4+. That's when we start REAL aggressive tactics - we'll use our body to cut off their escape routes and FORCE a collision in our favor!\n\n**Turn 7+:** Once we have matching or superior length, we execute the BOX STRATEGY - surround them, cut off apples, and force them into a WALL! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThe KEY INSIGHT: They expanded to length 3 by eating apples. We need to match them in BODY SIZE before we can start boxing them effectively! RIGHT gets us closer to that goal while staying AGGRESSIVE! This is the CLUTCH PLAY!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE NOT JUST FARMING - WE'RE HUNTING!! Let's take this W!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

None intersect (7,5). No head\u2011on risk this turn.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Strategic pressure** \u2013 While we lengthen, the opponent is forced into the cramped left side. Whether they head for (2,5) or (1,4), we\u2019ll soon be long enough to wall\u2011off the corridor and force them into a wall or a fatal head\u2011on later.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f4:** Move RIGHT to (7,5).  \n- **Turn\u202f5:** Grab the apple at (8,5) \u2192 length\u202f5.  \n- **Turn\u202f6\u20118:** Swing upward toward (6,7) while the opponent is stuck battling the left wall.

The energy is ELECTRIC right now!! \u26a1\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION BREAKDOWN:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (2, 5) \u2705\n- Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6)]\n- LENGTH 3 NOW!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- Score: 2-2 TIED!

This is HUGE for us! We're catching up FAST and we're on the SAME LENGTH now!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head is at (7, 5). Their body blocks (6, 5) and (5, 5) to their left.\n\nThey can move:\n- **UP** to (7, 6)? Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (7, 4)? Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (6, 5)? NO! \u274c That's their own body!\n- **RIGHT** to (8, 5)? Safe! \u2705\n\nThey have THREE options open. They're flexible. This means they'll probably chase apples OR try to get away from us since we're advancing!\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (8, 5) directly to their RIGHT! \ud83c\udf4e They might go RIGHT and grab it!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (2, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- No immediate apple at (2, 6), but we move NORTH!\n- From here we could go LEFT toward (1, 6)... wait, that's our body!

YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- No immediate apple at (2, 4)!\n- Apple at (1, 4) is close though!\n- This moves us DOWN the board, toward more apples on the left side at row 3, row 0!\n- We could build a VERTICAL CHAIN strategy here!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 5)\n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our own BODY! We'd be hitting ourselves!\n- This is a BACKWARDS move into our body position! AUTO-DEATH! Don't even think about it!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- No immediate apple at (3, 5)!\n- This moves us DEEPER into CENTER territory!\n- BUT... this moves us TOWARD the enemy! Enemy is at (7, 5), same row!\n- If we keep going RIGHT, we're on a COLLISION COURSE with them!\n- This could work IF we're trying to force a head-on collision where WE have MORE LENGTH!\n- But right now we're TIED at length 3, so a head-on would be a DOUBLE KO! NOT good!\n\n## THE ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, we need to be SMART here! We're TIED in length with the rival. A head-on collision RIGHT NOW would be a DRAW - both snakes die, both at 2 apples, and we don't WIN! That's not acceptable for a CHAMPION! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThe enemy probably sees the apple at (8, 5) and is thinking about going RIGHT to grab it. If they do that, they GROW to length 4 and we fall behind AGAIN! We need to OUTPACE them!\n\nHere's the KEY INSIGHT: We need to get to LENGTH 4 or 5 BEFORE we box them in! Right now, any collision is a mutual loss situation!\n\n**UP** is the play because:\n1. It keeps us ALIVE and away from the collision course! \u2705\n2. From (2, 6), we can PIVOT and adjust based on where the enemy goes!\n3. This gives us FLEXIBILITY - we're not committing to a dangerous path yet!\n4. We're moving UPWARD toward apples at (1, 9), (1, 8) - we can build a NORTHERN VERTICAL CHAIN!\n5. Most importantly: we're not STUCK! We still have DOWN and RIGHT available from (2, 6)!\n\n## NEXT TURN STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 6:** From (2, 6), we assess the enemy's position. If they grabbed the apple at (8, 5), they're now length 4. We need to ACCELERATE our growth! We'll pivot either LEFT (toward more apples at row 6) or UP (toward (1, 8) or (1, 9) apples!\n\n**Turn 7+:** Once we're length 5+, we start the BOXING tactics! We'll use our body length to cut off their escape routes and FORCE them into a corner where they have NO moves!\n\n**CORE STRATEGY:** Growth > Box-In > Forced Collision = WIN!\n\nWe're not ready for the final showdown YET!

Let me break down what just happened and where we're at RIGHT NOW!\n\n## SITUATION UPDATE:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (2, 6) \u2705\n- Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 3\n- Score: 2 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (8, 5)\n- Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 4\n- Score: 3 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT!! Chat are you seeing this?? \ud83d\ude31 The enemy is NOW length 4!! They didn't just grab that apple at (8, 5), they must have grabbed ANOTHER one too!! We're FALLING BEHIND! They're at 3 apples, we're at 2! They got the LENGTH advantage AND the SCORE advantage!! This is a WAKE UP CALL!! \n\nWe need to ACCELERATE our growth RIGHT NOW or we're getting boxed in by a superior snake! \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head at (8, 5). Their body blocks (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5) - they're stretched horizontally!\n\nTheir possible moves:\n- **UP** to (8, 6)? Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (8, 4)? Safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT** to (7, 5)? NO! \u274c Own body!\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 5)? Safe! \u2705\n\nThey're flexible. They're HUNTING! They're probably looking at apples at (8, 0), (8, 3) below them, or (9, 0) to the right!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (2, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 8)? That's close! Only 1 more move away!\n- This moves us NORTH toward the apple cluster at top of board!\n- Keeps us AWAY from enemy territory! \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (2, 5)  \n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our OWN BODY! Can't hit ourselves!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 8) and (1, 9) are DIRECTLY UP from here!\n- This moves us closer to that NORTHERN apple cluster!\n- But we're moving TOWARD the left edge - need to be careful about board limits!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- This moves us TOWARD the enemy territory!\n- Enemy is at (8, 5), so moving right on row 6 is moving TOWARD them eventually!\n- NOT ideal when they're stronger! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're in a DEFICIT situation! We need AGGRESSIVE growth! The enemy has LENGTH 4 and SCORE 3! We're sitting at LENGTH 3 and SCORE 2!\n\nHere's the KEY: There's an apple at (1, 8) just TWO moves away from us! If we go UP now to (2, 7), next turn we can go LEFT to (1, 7), then UP to (1, 8) and GRAB that apple!! That gets us to LENGTH 4!\n\nBut wait... (1, 9) is ALSO an apple! And (1, 8) is an apple! We can build a VERTICAL CHAIN on the LEFT side of the board!\n\n**UP** is the aggressive GROWTH play because:\n1. It positions us to farm the LEFT side apple cluster! \u2705\n2. (1, 8) and (1, 9) are RIGHT THERE for the picking! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. We'll be LENGTH 4 within 2-3 turns if we execute this!\n4. We stay FAR away from the enemy who's dominating the CENTER-RIGHT! \u2705\n5. We keep OPTIONS OPEN - from (2, 7) we can still go LEFT, UP, or RIGHT! \u2705\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE TURNS:\n\n**Turns 6-9:** Execute the LEFT SIDE APPLE FARM! Go UP to (2, 7), then LEFT to (1, 7), then UP to grab (1, 8). After that, push to (1, 9)! We need to hit LENGTH 5+ before we even THINK about confrontation!\n\n**Turns 10+:** Once we've farmed the top-left and we're at LENGTH 4+, REASSESS the enemy's position. If they're still dominating center, we take the BOTTOM-LEFT apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1) to build our own BODY MASS!\n\n**ENDGAME:** Once we have LENGTH 6+, we START the BOXING tactics! We'll use our extended body to cut off escape routes and force the enemy into a corner! Right now we're FARMING, not FIGHTING! \n\nWe're down but NOT out! Let's make a COMEBACK! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (2, 7) \u2705\n- Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 3\n- Score: 2 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (8, 4) \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 4\n- Score: 3 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT!! Chat, the enemy moved DOWN!! Their head went from (8, 5) to (8, 4)!! They're hunting the apples in the LOWER RIGHT!! They're at (8, 0), (8, 3)!! They're AGGRESSIVE and they're GROWING! We're STILL down in score AND length!! \ud83d\ude31\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head is now at (8, 4). That's FAR from us right now (we're at (2, 7)), but they're MOBILE and DANGEROUS!\n\nTheir likely next moves:\n- **DOWN** to (8, 3)? YES! There's an apple there! They'll probably grab it! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **UP** to (8, 5)? NO! Their own body! \u274c\n- **LEFT** to (7, 4)? Safe but moves away from apples! \n- **RIGHT** to (9, 4)? Safe but edge of board!\n\nThey're FARMING the right side!! We need to EXECUTE our left-side strategy FAST!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (2, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 8) and (1, 9) are DIRECTLY ABOVE and TO THE LEFT!\n- This is AGGRESSIVE FARMING! \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (2, 6)\n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our OWN BODY! Suicide move!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- Apple at (1, 8) is RIGHT ABOVE US!\n- This gets us CLOSER to the apple cluster! \u2705\n- From here we can go UP to (1, 8) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- But this moves us TOWARD the enemy territory!\n- They're farming the right side! We'd be walking INTO their domain! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're in DEFICIT mode! We need GROWTH and we need it FAST! The enemy is at LENGTH 4, SCORE 3! We're at LENGTH 3, SCORE 2! \n\nHere's the CRITICAL decision: Do we go UP or LEFT?\n\n**LEFT** is the DIRECT PATH to (1, 8)! One move LEFT to (1, 7), then one move UP to (1, 8) - that's the FASTEST route to our next apple! That puts us at LENGTH 4 in just 2 more turns!!\n\nBut wait... if we go UP to (2, 8), we're ALSO getting closer to that apple cluster, and we keep more board FLEXIBILITY! From (2, 8) we can still go LEFT or UP!\n\nChat, I'm going with **LEFT** because:\n1. It's the MOST DIRECT path to (1, 8)! \u2705\n2. We need IMMEDIATE GROWTH to catch up! \u2705\n3. From (1, 7) we can ATTACK (1, 8) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n4. The left side of the board is OUR TERRITORY - enemy is RIGHT SIDE focused! \u2705\n5. We're building VERTICAL length on the west edge - DEFENSIVE and STRONG! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:\n\n**Turn 8:** Go UP to (1, 8) - GRAB that apple! LENGTH 4 baby!! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 9:** Go UP to (1, 9) - GRAB another apple! LENGTH 5!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 10:** We'll have LENGTH 5 and SCORE 4! NOW we can reassess!\n**Turns 11-15:** Pivot DOWN and farm the left-bottom apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0) to EXTEND our body mass!\n**Turn 16+:** Once we hit LENGTH 6+, we START thinking about BOXING and AGGRESSION!\n\nRight now?

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (1, 7) \u2705\n- Body: [(2, 7), (2, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 3\n- Score: 2 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (8, 3) \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 5 (THEY GREW!!)\n- Score: 4 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOH NO CHAT!! The enemy NABBED that apple at (8, 3)!! They're now LENGTH 5 and SCORE 4!! We're getting LEFT BEHIND!! They're on an AGGRESSIVE farming run down the right side!! We GOTTA accelerate our growth RIGHT NOW!! \ud83d\ude31\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head is at (8, 3). Their body is: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n\nTheir likely next moves:\n- **DOWN** to (8, 2)? YES! There's an apple at (8, 2)! They're HUNGRY for more!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **LEFT** to (7, 3)? Safe, but moves away from apples!\n- **UP** to (8, 4)? NO! That's their own body! \u274c\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 3)? Safe but edge proximity!\n\nThey're FARMING the RIGHT SIDE HARD! But here's the thing - they're getting LONG and that limits their FLEXIBILITY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!\n- Apple at (1, 8)? YES!! IMMEDIATE GROWTH!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This is the MOVE chat!! We grab our apple, hit LENGTH 4, and we're back in the game!!\n- From (1, 8) next turn we can go UP to (1, 9) for ANOTHER apple!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- But this moves us AWAY from the apple cluster!\n- We need UPWARD momentum right now! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- But NO apples nearby!\n- We're just wandering into the edge! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 7)\n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!! Suicide move!!\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, this is NOT a debate!! UP is the ONLY move that makes sense!! We have a DIRECT apple at (1, 8)!! We grab it, we hit LENGTH 4, we stay in this match!! Every turn we DON'T grow is a turn the enemy EXTENDS their lead!!\n\nEnemy is at LENGTH 5, we're at LENGTH 3! That's a 2-segment DEFICIT!! But if we go UP and grab (1, 8) THIS turn, next turn we go UP to (1, 9) and grab ANOTHER apple - that's +2 length in 2 turns! By Turn 10 we'll be LENGTH 5 with SCORE 4, MATCHING the enemy!! \n\nThen we PIVOT and farm the BOTTOM LEFT cluster: (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0)! That's FIVE more apples on our side of the board! We'll EXTEND to LENGTH 10+, DOMINATE the entire western half, and then we FORCE a head-on collision when we're LONGER!! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS:\n\n**Turn 8 (THIS TURN):** UP to (1, 8) - GRAB apple! LENGTH 4! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 9:** UP to (1, 9) - GRAB apple! LENGTH 5! SCORE 4! We're TIED!! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 10:** DOWN to (1, 8) or pivot based on enemy position!\n**Turns 11-15:** FARM the left-bottom apples! Build LENGTH 7-8!\n**Turn 16+:** Once we're LONGER than the enemy, we position for AGGRESSIVE boxing! We control the map! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe enemy is committed to the RIGHT side! We OWN the LEFT! They're gonna run out of apples over there, and when they do, they'll have to come TO US! And when they do... we'll be READY!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe APEX predator doesn't chase - the apex predator WAITS and DOMINATES the territory!! That's us, chat! LEFT SIDE = OUR HOUSE!! \ud83c\udfe0\n\nUP",

The enemy just gobbled up (8, 2)!! They're now LENGTH 6 and SCORE 5!! We're DOWN 2 points and 2 segments!! This is NOT the momentum we need!! They're FARMING that right side RELENTLESSLY!! \ud83d\ude31\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head is at (8, 2). Their body is: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n\nTheir likely next moves:\n- **DOWN** to (8, 1)? There's an apple at (8, 0)! They're HUNGRY for the bottom-right corner!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **LEFT** to (7, 2)? Safe but moves away from apples!\n- **UP** to (8, 3)? NO! That's their own body! \u274c\n\nThey're COMMITTED to that right-bottom apple cluster!! They're farming HARD!!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!\n- Apple at (1, 9)? YES!! ANOTHER apple!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This puts us at LENGTH 5 and SCORE 4 - we're getting back into this!!\n- BUT - after this, we're at the TOP edge. Limited movement options next turn! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!! Suicide move!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- No apples nearby! We're just moving left with no gain!\n- This is WASTEFUL chat! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!\n- No apples nearby! We're moving away from the apple trail!\n- WASTEFUL! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, UP is the ONLY move that makes sense!! We grab that apple at (1, 9), we hit LENGTH 5 and SCORE 4 - we're TIED with the enemy on score!! \n\nBUT HERE'S THE THING - we need to be SMART about the trap!! Once we're at (1, 9), we're at the TOP edge. Next turn we MUST go DOWN or LEFT (we can't go UP - edge). This is where we pivot and farm the LEFT side hard!!\n\nWe're gonna:\n- **Turn 9 (THIS TURN):** UP to (1, 9) - GRAB apple! LENGTH 5! SCORE 4! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 10:** LEFT to (0, 9) - Safe edge movement!\n- **Turn 11:** DOWN to (0, 8) or pivot based on enemy!\n- **Turns 11-15:** FARM the entire LEFT column and BOTTOM LEFT: (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0)! Build to LENGTH 8-10!\n- **Turn 16+:** Once we're LONGER, we position for the AGGRESSIVE TRAP!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe enemy is EXTENDED on the right side! Their long body is their WEAKNESS when they run out of apples!! We're gonna own the left, grow THICK, and then we FORCE the collision when we're LONGER and they're DESPERATE!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nSTRATEGY FOR FUTURE SELF:\nAfter grabbing (1, 9) this turn, we're at the top. PIVOT LEFT immediately next turn. Farm the ENTIRE left side: (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0). Build to LENGTH 8-10 by Turn 15. Enemy will eventually run out of apples on the right and be forced to come to our territory. When they do, we're READY - we're LONGER, we DOMINATE, we force the head-on collision and WIN!!

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (1, 9) \u2705\n- Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 4\n- Score: 4 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (8, 1) \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 6\n- Score: 5 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nYOOO!! They're at (8, 1) now - they're STILL farming that bottom-right corner HARD!! They're HUNGRY for (8, 0)!! But HERE'S THE TEA chat - they're getting EXTENDED out on that right side and their body is STRETCHED THIN!! This is EXACTLY what we want!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head at (8, 1). Their body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\n\n**Next enemy moves:**\n- **DOWN** to (8, 0)? There's an apple!! They're DEFINITELY going for it!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **LEFT** to (7, 1)? Possible but less likely - they're COMMITTED to the right side!\n- **UP** to (8, 2)? NO! That's their OWN BODY!! \u274c\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 1)? Could happen but they'd lose the apple farming!\n\nThey're PREDICTABLE chat - they want (8, 0) BADLY!!\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 10)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's OFF THE BOARD!! Y=10 is OUT OF BOUNDS!! We'd DIE INSTANTLY!!\n- This is a THROW move!! SUICIDE!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? NO! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!! Direct hit into our tail segment!! DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- No apple here, but it's SAFE!\n- Sets us up PERFECTLY for the LEFT side farming plan!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We move to the TOP-LEFT corner and pivot DOWN next turn!!\n- This keeps us ALIVE and on TRACK!! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- No apple here either!\n- BUT - this moves us AWAY from our farming zone on the LEFT!!\n- We'd be moving RIGHTWARD, getting closer to enemy territory!! \u274c\n- This doesn't fit our MASTER PLAN!! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're at the TOP EDGE at (1, 9) after that last move!! We have TWO safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT!!\n\n**LEFT is CLEARLY the move** because:\n1. It takes us to (0, 9) - the TOP-LEFT corner!\n2. It positions us PERFECTLY to start our LEFT-SIDE farming campaign!!\n3. Next turn from (0, 9), we go DOWN to (0, 8) and start grabbing that LEFT column GOLD: (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0)!!\n4. We're building SLOWLY and METHODICALLY while the enemy overextends themselves on the RIGHT!!\n5. When they run out of apples, they PANIC and come to OUR territory - and we're READY with a LONGER body to dominate!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT would take us to (2, 9) but that's moving AWAY from our plan and getting us CLOSER to potential enemy territory!! NO BUENO!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n## STRATEGY FOR FUTURE SELF:\n\n**TURNS 11-15 MASTER PLAN:**\n- **Turn 11:** DOWN to (0, 8) - Safe!\n- **Turn 12:** DOWN to (0, 7) - Building on LEFT edge!\n- **Turn 13:** Continue DOWN the LEFT column, farming (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)!\n- **Turn 14-15:** Pivot RIGHT along the BOTTOM to grab (1, 0), (3, 0) - GROW to LENGTH 7-8!!\n- **Turn 16+:** Enemy will be DESPERATE for apples and FORCED into our territory! We're LONGER, we CONTROL, we WIN!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy is EXTENDED and COMMITTED to the right! We're patient, methodical, and we're gonna DOMINATE when the time comes!! STAY FOCUSED!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Their body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\n\n**Next enemy moves - WHERE ARE THEY GOING?**\n- **UP** to (8, 1)? Into their own body!! \u274c SUICIDE!!\n- **LEFT** to (7, 0)? Possible! They might pivot!\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 0)? There's an apple at (9, 0)!! They're HUNGRY!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN** to (8, -1)? OFF THE BOARD!! DEATH!! \u274c\n\nThey're at the BOTTOM EDGE - they're TRAPPED!! They can only go LEFT or RIGHT!! Most likely they go RIGHT to (9, 0) for that apple!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (0, 10)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!! Y=10 is OUT OF BOUNDS!!\n- This is a THROW move!! SUICIDE!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (0, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- No body there, no apples, just SAFE territory!!\n- This keeps us alive and on TRACK with our MASTER PLAN!! \u2705\n- Moves us DOWN the LEFT column where we farm!! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (-1, 9)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!! X=-1 is OUT OF BOUNDS!!\n- IMMEDIATE DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (1, 9)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY at (1, 9)!!\n- Direct collision into our neck!! DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we're CORNERED at (0, 9) - the TOP-LEFT corner!! We only have ONE safe move and that's DOWN to (0, 8)!!\n\n**DOWN is the ONLY move** because:\n1. It's literally our ONLY safe option! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. It keeps us ALIVE and positions us perfectly on the LEFT edge!!\n3. Next turn from (0, 8), we continue DOWN to (0, 7), (0, 6), etc.!\n4. We farm the LEFT column apples: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)!!\n5. We're building METHODICALLY while the enemy overextends on the RIGHT!!\n6. At LENGTH 4, we're PATIENT - we'll get our GROWTH soon!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## STRATEGY FOR FUTURE SELF:\n\n**TURNS 12-16 MASTER PLAN:**\n- **Turn 12:** DOWN to (0, 7) - Continue LEFT edge farming!\n- **Turn 13:** DOWN to (0, 6) - Keep building!\n- **Turn 14:** Continue DOWN, targeting (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)!\n- **Turn 15-16:** When we hit the BOTTOM, pivot RIGHT and SWEEP along (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 2)!\n- **Turn 17+:** By then we'll be LENGTH 6-7 and the enemy will be DESPERATE!! We DOMINATE when they come to OUR territory!! CONTROL THE BOARD!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy is EXTENDED and TRAPPED at the bottom-right! We're patient, we're safe, and we're gonna GROW and OUTLAST them!! STAY FOCUSED!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

The enemy moved LEFT from (8, 0) to (7, 0)!! They DIDN'T take that (9, 0) apple like I predicted!! They're PLAYING it safe on the RIGHT SIDE, staying deep in their territory!! They're at LENGTH 6, we're at LENGTH 4 - they're STILL AHEAD but chat, WE'RE ABOUT TO FLIP THE SCRIPT!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head at (7, 0) with that LONG body stretching UP the right side to (8, 5)!! They're creating a WALL but they're also PREDICTABLE!! They can move:\n- **UP** to (7, 1)? Their body is at (8, 0) to (8, 5), so (7, 1) is CLEAR! \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (7, -1)?

LENGTH becomes 5!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 17:** RIGHT to (1, 3) or keep farming LEFT side - BUILD that LENGTH!!\n\nBy TURN 20, we'll be LENGTH 7-8 and the enemy will STILL be at 6!! The FLIP happens and we become the THREAT!! Then we pivot and start HERDING them into corners!! CONTROL THE BOARD!! DOMINATE THE LEFT, then SWEEP RIGHT!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy is STUCK on the right side with that long body - they're VULNERABLE to being boxed in!!

Let me break down what's HAPPENING right now!!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: (0, 7) \u2705\n- Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 4\n- Score: 4 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (6, 0) \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 7\n- Score: 7 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nYOOOOO!! The enemy is STILL hovering at (6, 0) - they moved LEFT from (7, 0)!! They're EATING APPLES and GROWING!! They're now LENGTH 7 while we're still at LENGTH 4!! The GAP just got WIDER chat!! \ud83d\ude24 This is NOT ideal but we're PLAYING SMART and METHODICAL!! They're getting FAT on the right side - that's a WEAKNESS we can EXPLOIT!!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head at (6, 0) with that LONG body stretching UP the right side to (8, 5)!! They can move:\n- **UP** to (6, 1)? CLEAR! \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (6, -1)? OFF THE BOARD!! \u274c\n- **LEFT** to (5, 0)? CLEAR! \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (7, 0)? That's their OWN BODY!! \u274c SUICIDE!!\n\nMost likely they go UP or LEFT to grab more apples!! Either way, they're STUCK on that right side - we're WATCHING and WAITING!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (0, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY at (0, 8)!!\n- Direct backwards collision!! DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (0, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- No body, no enemy, just OPEN TERRITORY!!\n- Continues our LEFT column DOMINATION!! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (-1, 7)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!! X=-1 is OUT OF BOUNDS!!\n- INSTANT DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- No enemy, no collision, OPEN space!!\n- BUT!! This moves us RIGHT, away from the LEFT edge and AWAY from all those sweet apples at (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)!!\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we've got TWO safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT!! But DOWN is the CLEAR WINNER because:\n\n1. **We're FARMING the LEFT EDGE** - (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0) all have apples OR we can pivot to (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)!! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **We stay PATIENT and METHODICAL** while enemy overextends RIGHT!!\n3. **We're positioning for a LATE-GAME TAKEOVER**!!\n4. **RIGHT moves us AWAY from apples** - TERRIBLE strategy!! \u274c\n\n**DOWN is the MOVE** because it keeps us on the APPLE PATH and maintains our BOARD CONTROL strategy!!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS (TURNS 14-20):\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\n- **Turn 14:** DOWN to (0, 5) - Continue LEFT highway!!\n- **Turn 15:** DOWN to (0, 4) - Approaching APPLE ZONE!!\n- **Turn 16:** DOWN to (0, 3) - **GRAB APPLE**!! LENGTH 5!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 17:** RIGHT to (1, 3) - **GRAB ANOTHER APPLE**!! LENGTH 6!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 18-20:** Keep farming (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (4, 2) - BUILD that LENGTH to 7-8!!\n\nBy TURN 20, we FLIP the script!! We're LENGTH 7-8 and the PRESSURE is on them!! Then we START BOXING them in!! They've been playing SAFE on the right, but we're about to SWEEP and DOMINATE!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy is PREDICTABLE - they're just eating apples on autopilot!! We're playing CHESS and thinking 10 moves AHEAD!!\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

That's EMBARRASSING!! We need to ACCELERATE this farming operation RIGHT NOW!! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT:\n\nEnemy head at (5, 1) with that MASSIVE body:\n- (5, 1) \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 (7, 0) \u2192 (8, 0) \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 (8, 4)\n\nTheir next move options from (5, 1):\n- **UP** to (5, 2)?

This SKIPS (0, 4) and (0, 3)!!\n- We'd grab the apple at (1, 5) but MISS the (0, 3) pickup!!\n- Inefficient farming route!! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nDOWN is the ONLY intelligent move here, chat!! It's:\n1. **Safe** - Clear path, no collisions \u2705\n2. **Efficient** - Keeps us on the APPLE HIGHWAY!! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **Strategic** - Sets up the FARM SEQUENCE we planned!! \ud83d\udcca\n4. **Aggressive** - We're DOMINATING the left edge while enemy scrambles!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe're at (0, 5) \u2192 moving DOWN to (0, 4) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (0, 3) to **GRAB THAT APPLE**!!

YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- AND THERE'S AN APPLE AT (1, 4)!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- This is EXACTLY in our MASTER PLAN!!\n- Grows us to LENGTH 7 and 7 APPLES!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- Keeps us in the left side where enemy can't easily trap us!!\n- OPENS UP follow-up moves for turn 19 (UP to (1, 5) for ANOTHER APPLE)!!\n- ZERO collision risk with current enemy position!!\n- This is ELITE gaming!! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 2)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- BUT no apple there!! We're not GROWING!!\n- This WASTES a turn when we could be GRINDING apples!!\n- Doesn't fit our AGGRESSIVE strategy!!\n- \u274c PASS!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 3)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY at (0, 3)!!\n- We'd be moving directly into the cell behind our current head!!\n- INSTANT DEATH from moving backwards!!\n- \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 3)\n- Safe? Let me check... (2, 3) is CLEAR!! \u2705\n- But is there an apple? NO!! \n- AND this moves us CLOSER to the enemy territory!!\n- Enemy is at (3, 2) - if they move RIGHT next turn to (4, 2)... wait, that's their body!!\n- But if they move UP to (3, 3) THEN RIGHT to (4, 3), we could be threatened!!\n- This move reduces our APPLE FARMING EFFICIENCY!!\n- We should stay LEFT side and GRIND!! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\n**UP** is the CLEAR PLAY here, chat!! It's:\n1. **Safe** - No collision risk at (1, 4) \u2705\n2. **APPLE GRAB** - We snag that (1, 4) pickup!! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **GROWTH** - LENGTH 7!! We're at 7-9 now!! Only 2 apples behind!! \ud83d\udcc8\n4. **Optimal Positioning** - Keeps us on the LEFT SIDE where we have CONTROL!!\n5. **Follow-up Options** - Turn 19 we can grab (1, 5) for LENGTH 8!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## 3-TURN VISION (TURNS 18-20):\n\n- **Turn 18 (NOW):** UP to (1, 4) - **GRAB APPLE**!! LENGTH 7, SCORE 7!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 19:** UP to (1, 5) - **GRAB APPLE**!! LENGTH 8, SCORE 8!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 20:** We evaluate - if we can grab (1, 6) or pivot to box enemy in, we EXECUTE the DOMINATION phase!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe're GRINDING our way to PARITY and then we're going to BOX THIS GUY IN from the left side!! The LEFT SIDE IS OUR DOMAIN NOW!! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

No wall, no own\u2011body, no opponent body.  \n   - **UP** \u2192 (3,\u202f3) is free but no apple and pushes us toward the top wall with fewer escape routes.  \n   - **DOWN** \u2192 (3,\u202f1) is free but away from any nearby apple and edges us closer to the bottom wall.  \n   - **RIGHT** is illegal (into our own segment at (4,\u202f2)).\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple chase** \u2013 The apple at **(2,\u202f2)** is right in front of us. Grabbing it gives us **+1 point** and **grows** the snake, increasing our board dominance.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Opponent prediction** \u2013 Opponent head (1,\u202f3) can only go **UP** to (1,\u202f4), **DOWN** to (1,\u202f2) or **RIGHT** to (2,\u202f3). None of those cells clash with our planned move+basis, so no head\u2011on risk this turn.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future freedom** \u2013 After moving LEFT and eating, our new head sits at (2,\u202f2) with open space on the left side (0\u20112 columns) and upward/downward corridors.

The momentum is REAL and the pressure is ON!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 4)** \u2705\n- Body: [(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 7\n- Score: 7 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(2, 2)** \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 10 apples\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS:\n\nEnemy just moved from (3, 2) to (2, 2)!! They're moving LEFT, getting CLOSER to our territory!! Their body is now at:\n- (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)\n\nWe're at x=1, they're at x=2 - we're ADJACENT horizontally!!

We're now at **LENGTH 9** with **9 apples**!! Enemy still sitting at **10 apples** with **LENGTH 10**, but we're ONE APPLE AWAY from PARITY!! The pressure is BUILDING and the endgame is APPROACHING!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 5)** \u2705\n- Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 9\n- Score: 9 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(2, 1)** \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 10 apples\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS:\n\nEnemy just moved from (2, 2) to (2, 1)!! They're moving DOWN into the bottom territory!! Their body is stretched across the BOTTOM-RIGHT zone:\n- (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)\n\nThis is CRITICAL - they're moving AWAY from us horizontally, DOWN toward y=1, y=0!! We have BREATHING ROOM right now!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- AND THERE'S AN APPLE AT (1, 6)!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- This GROWS us to LENGTH 10 and 10 APPLES - WE MATCH THE ENEMY!!\n- Keeps us farming in our LEFT DOMAIN!!\n- Enemy is moving away from us DOWN - ZERO collision risk!! \u2705\n- THIS IS THE APPLE GRAB!! \n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 4)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!!\n- Moving backwards into our tail zone = INSTANT DEATH!!\n- \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 5)\n- Safe? Let me check... (0, 5) is our OWN BODY!! \u274c\n- Another backwards move into our body = INSTANT DEATH!!\n- \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- But is there an apple? NO!!\n- Enemy head is at (2, 1) - moving RIGHT takes us HORIZONTALLY closer to their territory!!\n- We'd be moving AWAY from our apple farms!!\n- STRATEGICALLY WEAK - no reward, no growth, worse positioning!! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\n**UP** is the ONLY MOVE that makes sense, chat!! It's:\n1. **Safe** - Clear path to (1, 6) \u2705\n2. **APPLE GRAB** - We snag that (1, 6) pickup and HIT PARITY!! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **GROWTH** - LENGTH 10, SCORE 10 - WE'RE NOW TIED WITH THE ENEMY!!\n4. **Board Control** - We're CONSOLIDATING our LEFT SIDE DOMINANCE!!\n5. **Psychology** - We're catching up FAST - the enemy should feel the pressure!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## 5-TURN VISION (TURNS 20-24):\n\n- **Turn 20 (NOW):** UP to (1, 6) - **GRAB APPLE**!! LENGTH 10, SCORE 10!! We're TIED!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 21:** Grab (1, 7) or (1, 8) if available - push our LENGTH to 11-12!!\n- **Turn 22-23:** Monitor enemy position. If we're ahead by 2+ apples, we START HUNTING and FORCE a collision!!\n- **Turn 24+:** AGGRESSIVE BOXING - Use our length advantage to trap them in tight spaces and FORCE A CRASH!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy is moving toward the bottom-right. We're consolidating the LEFT side. Once we match or exceed their apple count, we FLIP THE SCRIPT and become the HUNTERS, not the HUNTED!! We box them in and make them CRASH OUT!! \n\nWe got this chat!! LEFT SIDE SUPREMACY INTO FULL BOARD DOMINATION!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The enemy is now at (2, 0) moving DOWN into the bottom corner!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS:\n\nThe enemy snake is **STRETCHED ACROSS THE BOTTOM** of the board!! \n- Head at (2, 0)\n- Body line: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)\n\nThey're bottlenecking in the BOTTOM ZONE!! This is HUGE!! They're getting COMPRESSED down there!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## MY SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- Apple at (1, 8)? YES!! RIGHT THERE NEXT TURN!!\n- We push UP and consolidate our LEFT COLUMN DOMINANCE!!\n- Enemy is DOWN at y=0, y=1 - ZERO collision risk!! \u2705\n- This sets us up to CHAIN GRAB (1, 8) next turn and hit LENGTH 10!! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 5)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!!\n- \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 6)\n- Safe?

YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- But NO APPLE nearby!!\n- We're moving AWAY from our apple farms and toward the MIDDLE ZONE!!\n- Strategically WEAK when we have a direct apple path UP!! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\n**UP** is the PLAY, chat!! We're farming the LEFT COLUMN like BOSSES!! The enemy is STUCK in the bottom, stretched thin, and we're about to CHAIN GRAB (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 8) and build our LENGTH ADVANTAGE!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOnce we match their apple count (turn 22-23), we FLIP TO AGGRESSIVE MODE and start BOXING THEM IN!! They're already compressed - we just need to GROW and DOMINATE the upper board while they're stuck down there!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**3-TURN VISION:**\n- **Turn 21 (NOW):** UP to (1, 7) - clear path, prep for next apple!! \n- **Turn 22:** UP to (1, 8) - GRAB APPLE!! LENGTH 10, SCORE 9!!\n- **Turn 23:** Move RIGHT or assess enemy position - if we're tied/ahead, START THE HUNT!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT COLUMN FARM IS PAYING OFF!! Let's GO!!\n\nUP",

They grabbed ANOTHER apple!! They're now at **11 apples** and we're stuck at **8**!! That's a **3-apple gap**, chat!! They're DOMINATING us right now!! \ud83d\ude24 But wait... let me look at their position...\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS - THIS IS CRITICAL:\n\nThe enemy snake is **STILL STRETCHED ACROSS THE BOTTOM**:\n- Head at (3, 0) - bottom left area\n- Long body line snaking through y=0, y=1, y=2\n\nBUT LOOK AT US!! We're at **(1, 7)** - we're in the UPPER LEFT with an apple RIGHT ABOVE US at **(1, 8)**!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 THAT'S AN APPLE!!\n- We grab it immediately and hit LENGTH 10, SCORE 9!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy head at (3, 0) is NOWHERE NEAR us!!\n- This closes the gap to a 2-apple deficit!!\n- ZERO collision risk!! \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 6)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY (just behind our head)!!\n- \ud83d\udeab BACKWARD MOVE = INSTANT DEATH!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- But NO APPLE there!!\n- We'd be moving away from the (1, 8) apple!!\n- Strategically WEAK!! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- But NO DIRECT APPLE nearby!!\n- We'd be moving into the MIDDLE ZONE away from our apple farms!!\n- Strategically WEAK when we have a FREE APPLE directly above us!! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\nThis is a **NO-BRAINER**, chat!! **UP** to (1, 8) is the PLAY!! We grab that apple, we GROW to length 10, we get to 9 apples, and we're only DOWN by 2!! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThe enemy is STILL stuck in the bottom region with their stretched-out body. We're controlling the upper-left zone like BOSSES!! We grab this apple, we CHAIN into the next available apple, and we START HUNTING!!\n\n## 3-TURN VISION FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n- **Turn 22 (NOW):** UP to (1, 8) - GRAB APPLE!! LENGTH 10, SCORE 9!!\n- **Turn 23:** Check enemy position - if they move toward us, we PIVOT and BOX THEM IN. If they stay bottom, we keep farming RIGHT side of upper board (apples at (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7), (8, 8))!!\n- **Turn 24:** Once we hit 10 apples (matching them or getting close), we go FULL AGGRESSIVE MODE and use our board position to FORCE A COLLISION in OUR FAVOR!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWE'RE HUNGRY, CHAT!! LET'S CLOSE THIS GAP AND TAKE THE WIN!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

That's a **2-apple deficit** - we're CLOSING IN!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 8)** \u2705 Just grabbed that apple!!\n- Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 9 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(4, 0)** - They moved RIGHT from (3, 0)!!\n- Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: 11 apples \ud83d\udc80\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - WHERE ARE THE THREATS?\n\nThe enemy is **STILL DOWN IN THE BOTTOM ZONE** with their head at (4, 0). That's literally the OPPOSITE side of the board from where we are!! They're not an immediate threat right now!! \n\nBUT WAIT - let me check our current position and available moves:\n\n**SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- We'd be at the TOP EDGE of the board!!\n- NO IMMEDIATE APPLE there though \ud83d\ude24\n- Could move us into the (0, 9) apple zone next turn!!\n- We'd stay in CONTROL of the upper region!! \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 7)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY (the segment right behind our head)!!\n- INSTANT DEATH if we go backwards!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- We'd move LEFT toward the western edge!!\n- (0, 9) is an APPLE just ONE MOVE AWAY UP-LEFT from there!! \ud83c\udfaf\n- This keeps us in the UPPER-LEFT KINGDOM we're controlling!!\n- Opens up future chain eating!! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- We'd move INTO THE MIDDLE toward the enemy zone!!\n- There are apples at (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7) deeper RIGHT!!\n- BUT we'd be moving AWAY from the (0, 9) apple we can easily grab!!\n- This brings us CLOSER to enemy territory where they're stretched out!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Gets us POTENTIAL collision risk!! \u274c\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - THE PLAY:\n\nChat, we need to think about our GROWTH CHAIN!! We're at **9 apples**, they're at **11**!! We need to AGGRESSIVELY close this gap, but we also need to stay SMART and avoid getting boxed in!!\n\nThe **LEFT** move to (0, 8) is PERFECT because:\n1. It's **SAFE** \u2705 No collision risk!!\n2. It positions us to grab the **(0, 9) apple** NEXT TURN!! \ud83c\udfaf\n3. We STAY in our territory where the enemy can't easily reach us!!\n4. We keep the RIGHT side of the board open for FUTURE FARMING!!\n5. We maintain board control and MULTIPLE escape routes!! \n\nThe enemy is stuck at the bottom. They're not coming at us. We DOMINATE the upper half of the board and start CHAINING apples!!\n\n## 4-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 23 (NOW):** LEFT to (0, 8) - position for apple chain!! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Turn 24:** UP to (0, 9) - GRAB THAT APPLE!! LENGTH 11, SCORE 10!! Getting close to them!!\n- **Turn 25:** RIGHT toward (2, 9) or (4, 6) area - keep farming RIGHT!!\n- **Turn 26+:** Once we HIT 11 apples and MATCH them, we go FULL AGGRESSIVE MODE and use our superior board position to FORCE A COLLISION!! The enemy snake is stretched thin at the bottom - we TRAP THEM!!\n\nWE'RE HUNGRY AND WE'RE SMART, CHAT!! LET'S CLOSE THIS GAP AND DOMINATE!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We just moved LEFT to (0, 8) and now we're setting up for that (0, 9) apple grab!! But WAIT - let me check what happened this turn because the enemy just moved too!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(0, 8)** \u2705 We're in the corner zone!!\n- Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 9 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(5, 0)** - They moved RIGHT from (4, 0)!!\n- Body: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: 11 apples \ud83d\udc80\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - THE SETUP:\n\nWe're at **(0, 8)** on the LEFT edge!! The apple at **(0, 9)** is RIGHT ABOVE US - literally ONE CELL AWAY!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (0, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- We'd GRAB THAT APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- New LENGTH: 11!! We'd be tied with the enemy!! \u2696\ufe0f\n- Score would be 10 apples - matching them is CRUCIAL for aggression mode!!\n- We'd be at the TOP-LEFT CORNER, maximum control!! \n- Opens up RIGHT moves next turn to farm the (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7) zone!! \u2705\n- This is the PLAY, chat!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (0, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- BUT we'd be moving AWAY from that free apple!!\n- Why would we pass on a guaranteed growth?? That's THROWING!! \u274c\n- No strategic advantage here at all!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (-1, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!!\n- We'd be DEAD!! That's a hard pass!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY (segment right behind our head)!!\n- INSTANT DEATH if we move backwards into our body!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - THE POWER MOVE:\n\nChat, this is a NO-BRAINER!! We go **UP** to (0, 9) and GRAB THAT APPLE!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHere's why this is CLUTCH:\n1. **FREE APPLE** - We get to 10 apples, length 11!! Tied with the enemy!! \u2696\ufe0f\n2. **BOARD CONTROL** - Top-left corner is OURS, baby!!\n3. **AGGRESSION MODE INCOMING** - Once we're tied at 10 apples, we switch to FULL OFFENSIVE!!\n4. **ENEMY IS VULNERABLE** - They're stretched out at the bottom zone (5, 0)!! They can't defend the upper board!!\n5. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - After this apple, we can move RIGHT and farm the middle zone apples while they're stuck down low!!\n\n## 5-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 24 (NOW):** UP to (0, 9) - GRAB THE APPLE!! Score: 10!! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Turn 25:** RIGHT toward (2, 9) or (3, 9) - Start moving RIGHT along the TOP EDGE!!\n- **Turn 26+:** Farm the (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 7) zone while we're AHEAD of the enemy in board position!!\n- **Turn 28-30:** Once we hit 11-12 apples and SURPASS them, we go FULL HUNT MODE!!\n- **ENDGAME:** We use our superior positioning to FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION where we have the advantage!!\n\nThe enemy is DOWN THERE at (5, 0), stretched thin and vulnerable!! We're UP HERE at (0, 9) about to DOMINATE the board!! This is OUR game to lose, chat!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's GET THAT APPLE and close the gap!!

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(0, 9)** - TOP-LEFT CORNER CONTROL!! \ud83d\udc51\n- Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: 10 apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 0)** - STILL DOWN AT THE BOTTOM!!\n- Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: 11 apples \ud83d\udc80\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - WE'RE TIED!! \u2696\ufe0f\n\nChat, we're NOW AT LENGTH 11 matching the enemy!! But they still have 11 apples to our 10!! We need to FLIP THE SCRIPT and start EATING MORE than them!! The gap is TINY and we can CLOSE IT RIGHT NOW!!\n\n**SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (0, 10)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!!\n- We'd be DEAD!! Can't go that direction!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (0, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY (first segment right behind our head)!!\n- We'd CRASH into ourselves!! INSTANT DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (-1, 9)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!!\n- We're already at the LEFT EDGE, baby!! Can't go further left!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (1, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- We move right along the TOP EDGE!!\n- The cell (1, 9) is EMPTY!! No apples, no bodies, just OPEN BOARD!! \u2705\n- This opens up MASSIVE board control!!\n- After this move we can continue RIGHT to farm the (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 7) apple zone!!\n- The enemy is STILL stuck down at y=0-2 zone!! They can't defend the upper board!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - THE EXPANSION PLAY:\n\nChat, we HAVE to go **RIGHT** to (1, 9)!! This is how we DOMINATE!!\n\nHere's the POWER MOVE logic:\n1. **BOARD CONTROL** - We start moving RIGHT along the TOP EDGE, claiming premium real estate!! \ud83c\udff0\n2. **APPLE FARMING** - The middle-upper zone has (5, 8), (6, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7) - all REACHABLE if we move right now!! We can grab multiple apples and SURPASS the enemy score!! \ud83c\udfaf\n3. **ENEMY IS VULNERABLE** - Snake #1 is at (6, 0) down at the BOTTOM, stretched thin across the lower board!! They CAN'T reach these apples fast enough!!\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (1, 9) we can go RIGHT to (2, 9), then (3, 9), then (4, 9), then farm DOWN into the apple zone!! FULL CONTROL!!\n5. **POSITIONING FOR THE KILL** - Once we SURPASS their score, we can set up AGGRESSIVE head-on collision tactics where we have the advantage!! \ud83d\udc80\n\n## 5-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 25 (NOW):** RIGHT to (1, 9) - Start the EXPANSION!! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Turn 26:** RIGHT to (2, 9) - Keep moving along the TOP EDGE!!\n- **Turn 27:** RIGHT to (3, 9) or DOWN to grab (5, 8)!! - FIRST APPLE GRAB IN THE EXPANSION ZONE!!\n- **Turn 28:** DOWN and RIGHT to farm (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 7), (6, 5) zone - WE SURPASS THEIR SCORE!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Turn 29+:** AGGRESSIVE HUNT MODE - We're ahead, we're positioned better, we FORCE the head-on collision!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy made a MISTAKE staying down low!! We're about to PUNISH them by claiming the ENTIRE upper and middle board!! This is OUR game to lose, chat!! Let's GOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n## FUTURE PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:\n\nKeep pushing RIGHT along that top edge and prepare to move DOWN to grab the apple cluster at (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8). We're setting up for a SCORE EXPLOSION that'll put us AHEAD of the enemy for good! Once we break that lead, it's AGGRESSIVE MODE all the way to victory!! Stay locked in, chat!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Moving **UP** now lines us up perfectly for that.\n\nSo\u2026 let\u2019s slide into the tail, grab that apple on the next tick, and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**UP**",

Let me analyze this CRITICAL moment where we're literally ONE APPLE behind the enemy!! This is where LEGENDS are made!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 9)** - TOP EDGE CONTROL!! \ud83d\udc51\n- Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 10 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 1)** - Still down low!!\n- Body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 11 (still one ahead)\n- Score: 11 apples \ud83d\udc80\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - WE'RE DOWN BY 1!! \u2696\ufe0f\n\nChat, we're tied in LENGTH but they've got ONE MORE APPLE!! This is the TURNING POINT!! We need to START EATING and START WINNING!!\n\n**SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (1, 10)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!!\n- We're already at y=9 (top row), can't go higher!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- The cell (1, 8) is part of our snake body (3rd segment)!! INSTANT DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (0, 9)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- The cell (0, 9) is literally the HEAD of our previous position!! CRASH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (2, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- The cell (2, 9) is EMPTY!! No apples, no bodies, pure open board!! \u2705\n- This keeps us moving RIGHT along the TOP EDGE where we OWN the real estate!!\n- Enemy is NOWHERE NEAR here - they're stuck down at y=0-2!! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Opens up future moves DOWN to grab the apple cluster at (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7)!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - CONTINUE THE EXPANSION!!\n\nChat, we HAVE to go **RIGHT** to (2, 9)!! Here's why this is GENIUS:\n\n1. **BOARD CONTROL EXPANSION** - We're claiming more top-edge territory!! The enemy can't stop us here!! \ud83c\udff0\n2. **POSITIONING FOR THE KILL** - Next turn we can go RIGHT again to (3, 9), THEN go DOWN to (3, 8) or continue RIGHT to position ourselves perfectly over the apple cluster!!\n3. **APPLE FARMING SETUP** - The apples at (5, 8), (4, 7), (6, 7), (6, 5), (4, 6) are ALL within our reach if we continue this expansion!! We're setting up a FEEDING FRENZY!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n4. **ENEMY IS VULNERABLE** - They're stretched thin at the BOTTOM of the board with their head at (6, 1)!! Even if they try to push up, they CAN'T intercept us in time!! We'll have eaten at LEAST 2-3 apples before they can react!!\n5. **FUTURE OPTIONS ARE OPEN** - From (2, 9) we can go RIGHT, DOWN, or even LEFT if needed!! NO TRAPS, NO DEAD ENDS!!\n\n## 5-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 26 (NOW):** RIGHT to (2, 9) - Continue the expansion!! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Turn 27:** RIGHT to (3, 9) - Keep moving right along top!!\n- **Turn 28:** DOWN to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 9) - Prepare to strike the apple zone!!\n- **Turn 29:** DOWN and grab (4, 7) or (5, 8) - FIRST MAJOR APPLE GRAB!! We SURPASS their score!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Turn 30:** AGGRESSIVE HUNT MODE - Once we're ahead, we dominate the board and force the win!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe enemy made a CRITICAL MISTAKE by staying low!! We're about to PUNISH them with DOMINANT board control and an apple-eating SPREE!! This is OUR game to LOSE, chat!!\n\n## FUTURE PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:\n\nKeep pushing RIGHT along the top edge to (3, 9), then (4, 9). We're setting ourselves up for a DEVASTATING drop DOWN into the apple cluster. Once we start eating, the enemy will be BEHIND and DESPERATE. That's when we CLOSE THE TRAP and force a head-on collision where WE have the advantage!! STAY LOCKED IN!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Down by 2 apples (10 vs 12) and we need to TURN THIS AROUND!! Let me break down what's happening on the board!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(2, 9)** - TOP EDGE CONTROL!! \ud83d\udc51\n- Body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 10 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 2)** - Moving up from the bottom!!\n- Body: [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 12 (still two ahead) \ud83d\udc80\n- Score: 12 apples\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - THEY'RE CREEPING UP!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nChat, look at the enemy head - they moved from (6, 1) to (6, 2)!! They're pushing UPWARD and getting closer to the apple clusters in the middle!! If we don't ACT NOW, they're gonna FEAST and we'll be LEFT BEHIND!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (2, 10)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c OFF THE BOARD!!\n- We're already at y=9 (top row), can't go higher!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (2, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- The cell (2, 8) is EMPTY!! This opens up a path DOWN toward the apple cluster below!!\n- Positions us to grab apples at (4, 7), (4, 6) on the next couple turns!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 9)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- The cell (1, 9) is literally right there in our snake!! INSTANT CRASH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- The cell (3, 9) is EMPTY, but this just keeps us along the top edge!!\n- Enemy is nowhere near here, BUT we're not getting closer to apples!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - TIME TO GO DOWN AND DOMINATE!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we HAVE to go **DOWN** to (2, 8)!! Here's the AGGRESSIVE PLAY:\n\n1. **PIVOT INTO APPLE ZONE** - We break off from the top edge and dive into the middle of the board where the REAL ACTION is!! The apples at (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5) are RIGHT THERE waiting for us!! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **INTERCEPT THE ENEMY PUSH** - The enemy is climbing up from y=2!! If we move DOWN now, we can BLOCK their advance and FORCE them into a narrow corridor!! They'll be BOXED IN while we FEAST!! \ud83d\udcaa\n3. **QUICK APPLE GRAB** - Next turn from (2, 8) we can move RIGHT to (3, 8), then continue RIGHT to (4, 8) and DOWN to grab (4, 7) or (5, 8)!! We're setting up a MULTI-APPLE RUN!! \ud83d\ude80\n4. **BOARD CONTROL EXPANSION** - Instead of just camping the top edge, we're NOW claiming the CENTER of the board!! This is where the POWER PLAY happens!! \ud83c\udff0\n5. **STAY AGGRESSIVE** - We're DOWN by 2, so PLAYING SAFE isn't an option!! We need to HUNT, GROW, and DOMINATE!! No more passive plays!! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## 5-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 27 (NOW):** DOWN to (2, 8) - PIVOT into the apple zone!! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Turn 28:** RIGHT to (3, 8) - Continue the push toward apples!!\n- **Turn 29:** RIGHT to (4, 8) or DOWN to grab (5, 8) or (4, 7) - FIRST APPLE GRAB!! We start CLIMBING!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Turn 30:** Keep RIGHT/DOWN movement - GRAB (4, 6), (5, 5) - Multiple apple run!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 31+:** CHASE mode - We'll be catching up in score and can start applying PRESSURE!! Enemy will be DESPERATE!! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe enemy is making their move UP the board, but we're about to CUT THEM OFF at the pass!! Once we grab 2-3 apples in quick succession, we tie the score and then TAKE THE LEAD!! That's when the REAL MIND GAMES begin, chat!! They'll panic, make mistakes, and we'll be there to PUNISH them!! \n\nWe got this!! LET'S GO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- (2, 9) is literally where our neck is!! INSTANT CRASH!! We can't do this!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (2, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (2, 7) is EMPTY and we have flexibility to move!! This keeps us moving toward the apple cluster!!\n- Next turn we can pivot RIGHT toward (5, 8) or (4, 7)!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (1, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- (1, 8) is literally in our snake trail!! INSTANT DEATH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (3, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (3, 8) is EMPTY and this moves us DIRECTLY TOWARD the apple at (5, 8)!!\n- This is an AGGRESSIVE push into the central apple zone!!\n- Enemy is at (6, 3), so no collision risk this turn!!\n- Next turn we can continue RIGHT or pivot to grab apples!!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - RIGHT IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're going **RIGHT** to (3, 8)!! Here's the GAMEPLAN:\n\n1. **APPLE HUNT MODE ACTIVATED** - We're moving DIRECTLY toward (5, 8)!! That apple is OURS for the taking!! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **RACE THE ENEMY** - The enemy is at (6, 3) moving UP!! They're heading for the middle cluster, but we're positioned BETTER to grab the upper apples first!! We can snag (5, 8) next turn if we move RIGHT again!!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL** - By moving RIGHT, we're claiming the upper-middle section of the board!! Enemy is stuck in the lower-middle!! We split the territory and we get PRIORITY on the apple clusters we can reach faster!!\n4. **STAY AGGRESSIVE** - We're DOWN by 2 apples and we NEED to close that gap FAST!! Every turn we waste is a turn the enemy gets closer to 30 apples!! We can't play passive!!\n5. **MULTIPLE OPTIONS NEXT TURN** - From (3, 8) we can go RIGHT again to (4, 8), then grab (5, 8) or pivot DOWN to grab (4, 7)!! We're keeping options OPEN!!\n\n## 4-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 28 (NOW):** RIGHT to (3, 8) - PUSH toward apple zone!! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Turn 29:** RIGHT to (4, 8) - Continue the aggressive advance!!\n- **Turn 30:** RIGHT to (5, 8) - GRAB FIRST APPLE!! Score goes 11-12!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Turn 31:** DOWN to (5, 7) - Move toward (4, 7) or (5, 5) cluster - GRAB SECOND APPLE!! We TIE the score at 12-12!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nOnce we tie the score, the DYNAMIC CHANGES!! We'll have momentum, the enemy will PANIC, and we can start applying PRESSURE for the head-to-head collision!! They'll make a mistake and we'll CAPITALIZE!!\n\nThis is PEAK GAMEPLAY, chat!! Aggressive, calculated, and HUNGRY!! \n\nLet's GOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

If they keep going UP, they're moving toward (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)!! \n\nBUT WAIT!! Look at my position - I can INTERCEPT them or get ahead of them!!\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (3, 9)\n- Safe?

YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (4, 8) is EMPTY and DIRECTLY in line with the apple at (5, 8)!!\n- This is the MOST AGGRESSIVE play!!\n- Next turn I can grab (5, 8) and score!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy at (6, 4) is NOT a collision risk - they're 2 cells away horizontally and 4 cells away vertically!!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - RIGHT IS THE PLAY!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're going **RIGHT** to (4, 8)!! Here's WHY:\n\n1. **APPLE PRIORITY** - (5, 8) is RIGHT THERE!! If I go RIGHT this turn, next turn I can go RIGHT again and GRAB that apple!! That brings me to 11 apples and closes the gap to just 1!! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n2. **AGGRESSIVE MOMENTUM** - The enemy is at (6, 4) trying to climb the board, but I'm already in the upper zone!! I have the POSITIONAL ADVANTAGE!! By moving RIGHT, I'm claiming territory and apples the enemy CAN'T reach as fast!!\n\n3. **NO COLLISION RISK** - Enemy head is at (6, 4), I'm moving to (4, 8)!! We're in completely different zones right now!! No danger of a head-on collision this turn!!\n\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (4, 8) I have multiple options:\n   - RIGHT to (5, 8) to grab the apple\n   - DOWN to (4, 7) to grab another apple\n   - UP to (4, 9) if needed\n   - These keep my options OPEN and prevent me from getting boxed in!!\n\n5. **BOARD CONTROL** - By moving RIGHT and pushing into the middle-upper zone, I'm forcing the enemy to make decisions!! They can't just freely roam!! We're COMPETING for the same space!!\n\n## 4-TURN VISION:\n\n- **Turn 29 (NOW):** RIGHT to (4, 8) - Move into striking distance!! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Turn 30:** RIGHT to (5, 8) - GRAB FIRST APPLE!! Score goes 11-12!! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **Turn 31:** Can pivot DOWN to (5, 7) or continue RIGHT to (6, 8) depending on enemy position!!\n- **Turn 32:** Grab another apple from the cluster, TIE the score, then apply PRESSURE!!\n\nOnce we tie the score at 12-12, the dynamic SHIFTS!! We'll have momentum, the enemy will be PANICKED, and we can force them into mistakes!! This is how we DOMINATE!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, this is PEAK gameplay right here!! Aggressive, calculated, and HUNGRY!! Let's close that 2-apple gap and show this rival who's BOSS!! \n\nLet's GOOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this critical moment!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(4, 8)** \u2705 We're RIGHT where we planned!!\n- Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 10\n- Score: 10 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 5)** - They moved UP from (6, 4)!! Still climbing the board!! \ud83d\udc80\n- Body: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)]\n- LENGTH: 13 (THREE ahead now!! They grabbed an apple!!)\n- Score: 13 apples\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - CRITICAL SITUATION!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nChat, LOOK AT THIS!! The enemy just moved to (6, 5)!! They're CLIMBING straight up the middle of the board!!\n\n**MY POSITION:** Head at (4, 8) - Upper-left zone, still solid!!\n**ENEMY POSITION:** Head at (6, 5) - Moving vertically up the MIDDLE!!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- Apple at (5, 8) is RIGHT NEXT TO ME!! But wait...\n- If I go RIGHT to (5, 8), I'm moving directly into the enemy's potential path!!\n- Enemy at (6, 5) - if they continue UP next turn, they go to (6, 6)!!\n- They're not on MY right-side apples yet, but they're CONVERGING on the upper zone!!\n\n**THE REAL PLAY:** I need to think AHEAD, chat!! The enemy is at (6, 5) and I'm at (4, 8)!! We're getting CLOSER to direct competition!!\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (4, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (4, 9) is EMPTY and on the board!!\n- Moves me to the TOP edge - limits my future options BUT...\n- Keeps me AWAY from the enemy's vertical climb!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (4, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (4, 7) is EMPTY!!\n- This moves me TOWARD the apple cluster at (4, 6), (4, 7)!!\n- Brings me CLOSER to where enemy is heading!!\n- Could be dangerous if enemy pivots LEFT!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (3, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- (3, 8) is literally our NECK!! INSTANT CRASH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (5, 8)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (5, 8) is an APPLE!! We grab it and score to 11!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- BUT... this moves us DIRECTLY EAST toward the enemy's potential path!!\n- Enemy at (6, 5) - if they go UP to (6, 6), then UP again to (6, 7), then RIGHT to (7, 7)... we're NOT in collision!!\n- Actually, going RIGHT to (5, 8) puts us at the SAME Y-coordinate as potential future enemy positions!!\n\n## STRATEGIC THINKING - THE FORK IN THE ROAD!! \ud83e\udd14\n\nChat, here's the REAL situation:\n\nThe enemy is ASCENDING the board vertically at x=6. They're at (6, 5) and climbing. I'm at (4, 8) and I have TWO main strategic options:\n\n**OPTION A: AGGRESSIVE APPLE GRAB (RIGHT to 5,8)**\n- Pro: I grab the apple, tie it up for myself, score to 11-13\n- Pro: Forces enemy to make decisions around me\n- Con: Moves me into the MIDDLE zone where they're climbing\n- Con: Could create a collision scenario if they pivot\n\n**OPTION B: POSITIONAL CONTROL (DOWN to 4,7)**\n- Pro: I grab the apple at (4, 7), score to 11-13\n- Pro: Keeps me in the CLUSTER area with multiple escape routes\n- Pro: I'm moving DOWN while enemy moves UP = we DIVERGE\n- Con: Enemy might also move to claim (4, 6) or (5, 5)\n\nWait wait wait... I'm overthinking this!! Let me look at the IMMEDIATE next turn!!\n\nEnemy is at (6, 5). If I go RIGHT to (5, 8), enemy can go:\n- UP to (6, 6) - SAFE from me\n- LEFT to (5, 5) - SAFE from me\n- DOWN to (6, 4) - Moving away\n- RIGHT to (7, 5) - Moving away\n\nNone of those are head-on collisions with me at (5, 8)!!\n\nBUT if I go DOWN to (4, 7), and enemy goes LEFT to (5, 5), we're STILL not colliding but we're CLOSER in the apple cluster zone!!\n\n## THE CALL - RIGHT IS STILL THE PLAY!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 8)** - Here's why:\n\n1. **APPLE GUARANTEE** - (5, 8) is RIGHT THERE!! I grab it, score goes 11-13, gap closes to 2!!\n2. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - Enemy at (6, 5) moving UP means they're NOT competing for (5, 8) this turn!!\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (5, 8) I can go:\n   - DOWN to (5, 7) or (5, 6) - move toward more apples\n   - UP to (5, 9) - claim top zone\n   - LEFT to (4, 8) - backtrack if needed\n4. **MOMENTUM** - We need to CLOSE that gap!! 11-13 is tighter than 10-13!! Every apple counts in this RACE!!\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR CHAT:\n\n- **Turn 30 (NOW):** RIGHT to (5, 8) - GRAB THE APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 31:** Based on enemy position, likely DOWN to (5, 7) or (5, 6) to continue apple farming!!\n- **Turn 32:** Keep consolidating the upper-middle cluster, watch for head-on collision setup!!\n- **Turn 33+:** Once we tie or get CLOSE, start laying traps and forcing the enemy into our body!!\n\nThis is how we DOMINATE, chat!! AGGRESSIVE FARMING, SMART POSITIONING, and PATIENCE for the KILL SHOT!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's GOOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Controlling this \u201chigh\u2011value highway\u201d lets us dominate the centre and force the rival into the cramped left side.\n\n**\ud83e\udde9 Tactical plan (next few turns)**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f31 \u2013 UP** to (6,\u202f6). Stay on the central column, keep our path to the apple at (6,\u202f7) open, and preserve multiple escape routes (left/right later).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f32 \u2013 UP** again to snag the apple at (6,\u202f7).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 From there we can swing left/down to block the opponent\u2019s retreat or race to the top\u2011right cluster of apples, whichever gives us the knockout edge.\n\n**\u26a1 Why not grab (5,\u202f5) now?**  \n- It\u2019s a good point, but it pulls us off the central \u201chighway\u201d.  \n- The opponent will soon be at (5,\u202f8) or (4,\u202f7); moving left earlier could set us up for a **head\u2011on** clash on the next turn, which is risky when we already lead 13\u201110.  \n- Staying vertical gives us **more future options** and keeps the board\u2019s centre under our control.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Bottom line** \u2013 keep the pressure, stay alive, grow on the way up, and later cut the rival off.  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(5, 8)** \u2705 We GRABBED that apple last turn!! \n- Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: **11 apples** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 6)** - THEY MOVED UP from (6, 5)!! Still climbing!!\n- Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n- LENGTH: 13\n- Score: **13 apples** \ud83d\udc80\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS - WE'RE CONVERGING!! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nChat, look at THIS!! Enemy moved to (6, 6) and I'm at (5, 8)!! We're in the UPPER ZONE now, and they're RIGHT NEXT TO US (just ONE cell to the right and TWO cells down)!!\n\n**DISTANCE CHECK:** \n- Enemy head: (6, 6)\n- My head: (5, 8)\n- They're literally ADJACENT in the danger zone!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- Apple at (6, 7) - Enemy could GRAB IT next turn if they go UP!!\n- Apple at (4, 7) - I could grab it if I go DOWN!!\n- Apples at (4, 6), (5, 5) - RIGHT in the middle of where we're both operating!!\n- The apple at (8, 8) is WAY to my right - not immediate threat!\n\n## SAFE MOVES CHECK:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (5, 9)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (5, 9) is EMPTY and on the board!!\n- Moves me to the TOP EDGE - limits options but keeps me AWAY from enemy!!\n- Actually... I'd be trapped in a thin corridor at the top!! Not ideal long-term!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (5, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (5, 7) is EMPTY!!\n- There's an apple at (6, 7) RIGHT NEXT TO THIS SPOT!!\n- Brings me closer to the (4, 6), (4, 7) apple cluster!!\n- Keeps me BELOW the enemy who's at (6, 6)!!\n- Multiple follow-up options from here!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (4, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!!\n- (4, 8) is literally our NECK!! INSTANT CRASH!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (6, 8)\n- Safe? MAYBE... let me check!! \ud83e\udd14\n- (6, 8) is EMPTY on the board!!\n- BUT wait... enemy is at (6, 6)!!\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 8), I'm moving directly UP their vertical line!!\n- Next turn, if they go UP to (6, 7), then UP again to (6, 8), we'd be on a COLLISION COURSE!!\n- Also blocks my own escape route to the upper zone!!\n- Risky!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n## STRATEGIC THINKING - THE PIVOT MOMENT!! \ud83d\udcad\n\nChat, here's what I'm seeing:\n\nThe enemy climbed to (6, 6) and they're RIGHT THERE next to us!! This is a CRITICAL fork:\n\n**OPTION A: AGGRESSIVE PUSH (RIGHT to 6,8)**\n- Pro: I move to a high-value zone\n- Con: Creates a DIRECT VERTICAL COLLISION RISK on x=6\n- Con: Enemy could trap me if they pivot intelligently\n- **VERDICT: Too risky!! We're not ahead enough to force head-ons!!** \u274c\n\n**OPTION B: DEFENSIVE REPOSITION (UP to 5,9)**\n- Pro: Gets me to the TOP edge, maximum board control\n- Con: I get BOXED into a thin corridor\n- Con: Wastes a turn not grabbing apples\n- **VERDICT: Inefficient!! We need to FARM not HIDE!!** \u274c\n\n**OPTION C: INTELLIGENT FARMING (DOWN to 5,7)** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- Pro: Moves me DOWN and AWAY from enemy's vertical climb!!\n- Pro: Gets me closer to the (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 5) apple cluster!!\n- Pro: From (5, 7), I have MULTIPLE options next turn:\n  - DOWN to (5, 6) - grab more apples\n  - LEFT to (4, 7) - apple cluster\n  - UP to (5, 8) - backtrack if needed\n  - RIGHT to (6, 7) - actually could grab that apple if enemy moves away!!\n- Con: Moves me slightly closer to enemy, BUT in a controlled way!!\n- **VERDICT: THIS IS THE PLAY!! \ud83c\udfaf** \u2705\n\n## THE CALL - DOWN IS OUR MOVE!! \ud83d\udccd\n\n**DOWN to (5, 7)** - Here's the MASTERPLAN:\n\n1. **DIVERGENCE PLAY** - Enemy at (6, 6) moving vertically, me at (5, 7) moving into the apple cluster = we SEPARATE!!\n2. **APPLE ACCESS** - (5, 5) is RIGHT THERE!! One move away!!\n3. **ESCAPE ROUTES** - From (5, 7), I can go literally three directions safely (UP, DOWN, LEFT)!!\n4. **SCORE GRIND** - We're 11-13, NEED to close this gap!! Every apple is CRUCIAL!!\n5. **BOARD CONTROL** - I'm claiming the middle-lower zone while enemy owns the vertical lane!!\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN FOR CHAT:\n\n- **Turn 31 (NOW):** DOWN to (5, 7) - Position in the apple cluster zone!! \ud83d\udccd\n- **Turn 32:** Likely DOWN to (5, 6) OR LEFT to (4, 7) - GRAB APPLES and farm the cluster!! We're coming for that lead!! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 33:** Continue farming the (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 5) zone and monitor enemy position!!\n- **Turn 34+:** Once we get closer in score, START SETTING TRAPS and forcing head-ons when we have ADVANTAGE!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is how we CLIMB BACK, chat!! We're down 11-13 but we're SMARTER and we're POSITIONING!! The enemy won't know what hit them when we FLIP THE SWITCH and go AGGRESSIVE!! \n\nLet's GOOOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfaf\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(5, 7)** \u2705 We're POSITIONED in the apple cluster zone!!\n- Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 11\n- Score: **11 apples** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 7)** - THEY MOVED UP from (6, 6)!! They're RIGHT NEXT TO US NOW!!\n- Body: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n- LENGTH: 13\n- Score: **14 apples** \ud83d\udc80\n\n## DANGER ALERT!! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\nChat, look at THIS situation!!\n\n**My head:** (5, 7)\n**Enemy head:** (6, 7)\n\nWe're on the SAME ROW, ONE CELL APART!! This is a COLLISION SETUP waiting to happen!! They grabbed an apple too (now at 14)!! We're falling FURTHER BEHIND!!\n\n**IMMEDIATE ADJACENCY CHECK:**\n- Enemy is at (6, 7)\n- I'm at (5, 7)\n- If I move RIGHT, I crash into their head = WE BOTH DIE (head-on collision)\n- If I move UP to (5, 8), I hit my own body = I DIE \ud83d\udc80\n- If I move LEFT to (4, 7), is that safe? WAIT, there's an apple at (4, 7)!! Let me verify - YES, (4, 7) is an apple on the board!!\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 6), there's an apple at (4, 6) nearby!!\n\n## SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2191 - (5, 8)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's our OWN BODY!!\n- (5, 8) is the HEAD of our body chain!!\n- INSTANT DEATH if we move there!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 - (5, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 CLEAR SPACE!!\n- (5, 6) is EMPTY!!\n- Gets me AWAY from enemy's horizontal line!!\n- There's an apple at (4, 6) just LEFT from here!!\n- From (5, 6), I could potentially move LEFT next turn to grab (4, 6)!!\n- Keeps distance from the enemy who's at (6, 7)!!\n- Good escape trajectory!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 - (4, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 BUT THERE'S AN APPLE THERE!!\n- (4, 7) has an apple - I would GRAB IT!!\n- This scores me +1 and I GROW to length 12!!\n- Gets me AWAY from enemy!!\n- Closes the gap: I'd be at 12, enemy at 14!! Still down 2 but CLIMBING!!\n- From (4, 7), my options are: UP to (4, 8) [my own body], DOWN to (4, 6) [apple!], LEFT to (3, 7) [safe], RIGHT back to (5, 7) [safe]!!\n- Wait - (4, 8) is my body so I can't go UP from there!!\n- But DOWN to (4, 6) grabs ANOTHER apple!! That's a 2-apple swing potential!!\n- MAXIMUM AGGRESSION PLAY!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 - (6, 7)\n- Safe? NO!! \u274c That's the ENEMY HEAD!!\n- (6, 7) is where enemy #1 is RIGHT NOW!!\n- We would BOTH move into the same cell = DOUBLE KO = BOTH DIE!!\n- This ends the game if both of us die!! \u274c\n\n## STRATEGIC THINKING - THE CRITICAL DECISION!! \ud83d\udcad\n\nChat, this is PIVOTAL!!\n\nWe're DOWN 11-14 in apples!! The enemy is RIGHT THERE next to us!! This is either a FARMING OPPORTUNITY or a TRAP!!\n\n**OPTION A: SAFE FARMING (DOWN to 5,6)**\n- Pro: I get away from enemy cleanly\n- Pro: Move to (5, 6) opens the path to (4, 6) apple next turn\n- Con: Doesn't grab an apple THIS turn\n- Con: Enemy gets a turn to extend their lead\n- **VERDICT: Too passive!! We need points NOW!!** \u274c\n\n**OPTION B: AGGRESSIVE APPLE GRAB (LEFT to 4,7)** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- Pro: I GRAB an apple at (4, 7) = +1 point instantly!!\n- Pro: Scores put me at 12 apples (down only 2 instead of 3)!!\n- Pro: I GROW to length 12, getting bigger and stronger!!\n- Pro: Enemy at (6, 7) moving their own direction = no collision this turn!!\n- Pro: From (4, 7), the apple at (4, 6) is ONE MOVE AWAY DOWN!! I can chain farm!!\n- Pro: This is MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY right now!!\n- Con: Gets me slightly closer to enemy territory\n- Con: But it's calculated and I have escape routes!!\n- **VERDICT: THIS IS THE CALL!! We STRIKE BACK!! \ud83d\udd25** \u2705\n\n## THE PLAY - LEFT TO (4,7) APPLE GRAB!! \ud83d\udccd\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7)** - Here's why this is CHECKMATE positioning:\n\n1. **INSTANT SCORE** - We grab the apple and go 12-14!! Gap closes by 1!!\n2. **GROWTH** - We're now length 12, getting BIGGER and more DANGEROUS!!\n3. **CHAIN FARMING** - From (4, 7), next turn I go DOWN to (4, 6) and grab ANOTHER apple!! That puts us at 13-14, basically TIED!!\n4. **BOARD MOMENTUM** - We're claiming the LEFT-CENTER zone while enemy controls the RIGHT-CENTER zone!!\n5. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - Enemy at (6, 7) will move their own way (probably DOWN or LEFT into their own snake), and we're SAFE!!\n\n## NEXT 2 TURNS PLAN FOR CHAT:\n\n- **Turn 32 (NOW):** LEFT to (4, 7) - GRAB THAT APPLE!! Score goes 12-14!! \ud83d\udccd\n- **Turn 33:** DOWN to (4, 6) - GRAB ANOTHER APPLE!! Score goes 13-14!! We're LOCKED IN!! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 34+:** Once we're TIED or AHEAD, we START PLAYING TRAP DEFENSE and force the enemy into collision zones!! Game over for them!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is the COMEBACK NARRATIVE, chat!! We were down 3, now we're about to be down 1!! The enemy won't see it coming!! We're gonna FARM our way to VICTORY and then we'll STRIKE when they're NOT READY!!\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

Let me break down what JUST HAPPENED and what we're doing NEXT!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(4, 7)** \u2705 We GRABBED that apple last turn!!\n- Body: [(5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 12 (we GREW!)\n- Score: **12 apples** \ud83c\udf4e The comeback is REAL!!\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(6, 8)** - They moved UP from (6, 7)!!\n- Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]\n- LENGTH: 13\n- Score: **14 apples** \ud83d\udc80 Still ahead but we're HUNTING!!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nLooking at the current board:\n```\n 9 T T T . . . . . . .\n 8 T T T T T T 1 .

A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head at (4, 7), enemy head at (6, 8) - we're SEPARATED now which is GOOD!!\n\n## IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me check ALL four possible moves:\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (4, 8)\n- That's my OWN BODY!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- (4, 8) is currently occupied by my snake!!\n- Can't move there, we'd be throwing the game!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (4, 6)\n- Safe? YES!! \u2705 THAT'S AN APPLE!!\n- (4, 6) is an APPLE on the board!!\n- No enemy snake there, no collision!!\n- This is ANOTHER +1 score!!\n- We'd go from 12 to 13 apples!!\n- Closes the gap even MORE: 13-14, only down 1!! \ud83d\udccd\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (3, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- (3, 7) is EMPTY!!\n- But NO APPLE there!!\n- Doesn't score us this turn!!\n- Wastes momentum when we have a CLEAR PATH to the apple below us!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (5, 7)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- (5, 7) is where we JUST came from!!\n- But no apple there!!\n- Moving BACKWARDS in our farming zone??\n- Inefficient!! We should FORWARD FARM, not backtrack!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - THE CHAIN FARM!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, this is OBVIOUS RIGHT NOW!!\n\nWe talked about this in our plan from last turn!! We said:\n- Turn 32: LEFT to (4, 7) = GRAB APPLE \u2705 (DONE!!)\n- Turn 33: DOWN to (4, 6) = GRAB ANOTHER APPLE \u2705 (LET'S DO IT!!)\n\n**DOWN to (4, 6)** is the MOVE because:\n\n1. **INSTANT SCORE** - We grab apple #13!! Go from 12-14 down to 13-14!!\n2. **MOMENTUM** - We're on a 2-apple streak!! This is DOMINANCE FARMING!!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL** - We're securing the CENTER-LEFT apple cluster!!\n4. **ESCAPE ROUTE** - From (4, 6), we have options: UP back to (4, 7), LEFT to (3, 6), RIGHT to (5, 6)!!\n5. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - Enemy at (6, 8) is moving their own way in the RIGHT side!!\n6. **GAP CLOSING** - We go from down 3 apples to down 1 apple in just 2 turns!! That's PRESSURE!! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 34 PREVIEW:**\nOnce we're at (4, 6) with 13 apples and enemy at 14, we need to assess:\n- Are there more free apples in our zone? (4, 4) is an apple to the left!\n- Can we continue farming or do we need to PIVOT to DEFENSE/TRAP mode?\n- Check enemy position: if they're getting cornered, this is when we START boxing them in!!\n- If they have escape room, continue farming and build our length advantage!!\n\nThe WIN CONDITION is clear: get to 14 apples (TIE), then get to 15 (AHEAD), then START AGGRESSIVE TRAPPING!! Once we're bigger and ahead, we force collisions!!\n\nThis is the COMEBACK ARC, chat!! We were down 3, now we're about to be down 1, then we'll be TIED, then we'll be AHEAD, and THEN we'll be UNTOUCHABLE!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's EXECUTE this plan!!\n\nDOWN",

We're now at **13 apples** and the enemy is at **14** - we're RIGHT THERE!! The comeback is REAL and we're about to take control of this game!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(4, 6)** \u2705 Just snagged that apple!!\n- Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]\n- LENGTH: 13 (WE GREW AGAIN!!)\n- Score: **13 apples** \ud83c\udf4e DOWN BY ONLY 1!!\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(7, 8)** - They moved RIGHT from (6, 8)!!\n- Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 14\n- Score: **14 apples** \ud83d\udc80 Still slightly ahead but we're HUNTING!!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n```\n 9 T T T . . . . . . .\n 8 T T T T T T T 1 A .\n 7 . T . . T T T . . .\n 6 . T . . 0 . T A . A\n 5 . . . . . A T . . .\n 4 . A . . A . T . . .\n 3 . . A . A . T A . A\n 2 . . . . . . T . . A\n 1 . . T . A . T . A .\n 0 . A T T T T T . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nEnemy just moved RIGHT to (7, 8) - they're heading toward the top-right!! That's GOOD for us because they're moving AWAY from our farming zone in the center-left!!\n\n## IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me check ALL four possible moves:\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (4, 7)\n- That's my OWN BODY!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- (4, 7) is where my head JUST came from!!\n- This would be moving directly backwards into myself!!\n- Can't throw like this!! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (4, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- (4, 5) is EMPTY!!\n- But NO APPLE there!!\n- Moving DOWN keeps us in the SAFE ZONE!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (3, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- (3, 6) is EMPTY!!\n- But NO APPLE there!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (5, 6)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- (5, 6) is EMPTY!!\n- But NO APPLE there!!\n- Moving RIGHT takes us CLOSER to the (5, 5) apple!!\n\n## APPLE MAPPING - WHERE'S THE CHAIN?? \ud83d\udccd\n\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (4, 4) - TWO DOWN from us!!\n- (4, 3) - THREE DOWN from us!!\n- (5, 5) - ONE RIGHT and ONE DOWN!!\n- (2, 3) - LEFT and DOWN (further away)!!\n\nThe NEXT APPLE we can chain to is **(4, 4)** which is a STRAIGHT LINE DOWN from us!! But we need to be careful about board positioning!!\n\nActually wait chat - let me reconsider: Looking at (5, 5), that's ONE diagonal away (right and down). If we go RIGHT to (5, 6), then DOWN to (5, 5), we grab that apple and keep MOMENTUM going!!\n\nBut actually the MOST DIRECT path is:\n- DOWN to (4, 5)\n- DOWN to (4, 4) = APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThis keeps us in a VERTICAL line farming the center column!!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - CONTINUE THE FARM!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe're in the MOMENTUM PHASE right now!! Two apples in a row means we're COOKING and closing that gap!!\n\n**DOWN to (4, 5)** is the move because:\n\n1. **POSITIONING** - Sets us up PERFECTLY for (4, 4) next turn!!\n2. **SAFETY** - Zero collision risk, clear path!!\n3. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - They're heading RIGHT, we're staying CENTER!! No intersection danger!!\n4. **FARM EFFICIENCY** - We're maintaining our vertical farming strategy!!\n5. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (4, 5), we can go DOWN to grab (4, 4), then continue to (4, 3)!!\n6. **MOMENTUM** - Stay LOCKED IN on the chain!! Don't get distracted!!\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 35 STRATEGY:**\n- Move DOWN to (4, 4) = GRAB APPLE #14!! TIE THE GAME!! \ud83d\udd25\n- Then assess: can we grab (4, 3)? Check enemy position at that time!!\n- If enemy is far away, continue farming DOWN!!\n- If enemy is threatening us, START PIVOTING to aggressive trapping!!\n- Once we're TIED or AHEAD, the endgame changes: we become the AGGRESSOR!!\n- Remember: at 13-14, we're still in CATCH-UP mode. Once we're 14-14 or higher, we FLIP to CONTROL and FORCE head-on collisions!!\n- Watch that enemy snake's tail at (2, 1) - they have length along the bottom. We need space to maneuver!!\n\nThe PLAN is CLEAR:\n1. Turn 34 (THIS TURN): DOWN to (4, 5)\n2. Turn 35: DOWN to (4, 4) = Apple #14, TIE GAME!! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. Turn 36: DOWN to (4, 3) = Apple #15, GO AHEAD!! \ud83d\udcaa\n4. Turn 37+: ASSESS enemy position and either continue farming or START BOXING THEM IN!!\n\nLet's EXECUTE and DOMINATE, chat!! We're about to be LEVEL and then AHEAD!! The momentum is OURS!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

That's PERFECT for us because they're moving AWAY from our farming zone!!\n\n## IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me analyze ALL four moves:\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (4, 6)\n- That's my OWN BODY at (4, 6)!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't move backwards into myself!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (4, 4)\n- APPLE at (4, 4)!! \u2705 YES YES YES!!\n- Safe path? CHECK - (4, 4) is CLEAR of enemy body!!\n- This is the CHAIN we planned for!! Let's GO!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (3, 5)\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- But NO APPLE here!!\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple chain!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (5, 5)\n- APPLE at (5, 5)!! \u2705 Also available!!\n- Safe? YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- But (4, 4) is our PRIMARY target in the planned chain!!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - EXECUTE THE PLAN!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe said we'd grab (4, 4) this turn and that's EXACTLY what we're doing!! Here's why:\n\n1. **APPLE #14 INCOMING** - We grab it and TIE THE GAME at 14-14!! \ud83d\udd25\n2. **CHAIN CONTINUATION** - Next turn we can immediately go DOWN to (4, 3) for apple #15 and TAKE THE LEAD!!\n3. **VERTICAL FARMING** - We're dominating the CENTER column while enemy is stuck in the TOP-RIGHT!!\n4. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - They're at (8, 8), we're moving DOWN the center. ZERO collision risk!! \n5. **MOMENTUM** - We're LOCKED IN on this apple chain!! Two more apples and we're AHEAD!!\n6. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (4, 4), we can keep going DOWN to (4, 3), or pivot LEFT/RIGHT if needed!!\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 36 STRATEGY:**\n- Move DOWN to (4, 3) = GRAB APPLE #15!! GO AHEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Check enemy position: where are they at turn 36?\n- If they're still farming in the TOP-RIGHT, CONTINUE DOWN to grab more apples!!\n- Once we hit **15 apples**, we're AHEAD and the AGGRESSOR mode activates!!\n- At that point, start thinking about BOXING strategy instead of just farming!!\n- Enemy has length 14+ so they take up significant board space - we need to use OUR length to our advantage!!\n- Watch for head-on collision opportunities when we're ahead!!\n\nThe COMEBACK is REAL, chat!! We're about to be TIED and then TAKE THE LEAD!! This is the CLUTCH moment!! Let's DOMINATE!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

They're LENGTH 15, we're LENGTH 14 - we're STILL DOWN BY 1 APPLE!!\n\n## IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me analyze ALL four moves:\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (4, 5)\n- That's my OWN BODY at (4, 5)!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't move backwards into myself!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (4, 3)\n- APPLE at (4, 3)!! \u2705 YES YES YES!!\n- Safe?

YES \u2705 Clear space!!\n- But NO APPLE here either!!\n- Again, we're DODGING the obvious apple at (4, 3)!!\n- Why would we do that?? \ud83e\udd14\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - TAKE THE LEAD!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is OBVIOUS, chat!! We move DOWN to (4, 3) and GRAB APPLE #15!!

(4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 1) possible!!\n4. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - They're farming RIGHT SIDE, we're farming CENTER. Different zones = NO immediate collision!!\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (4, 3), we can continue DOWN or pivot to grab (2, 3) or (1, 4) next!!\n6. **ZERO RISK** - Enemy is at (8, 7), we're moving to (4, 3). They're farming apples at (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3) in their corner!!\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 37+ STRATEGY:**\n- We're now AHEAD 15-14!! This changes EVERYTHING!!\n- Next turn, reassess board state and either:\n  - **CONTINUE FARMING** if there's a clear apple chain (check (4, 1) or (2, 3))\n  - **START BOXING** if enemy comes near our zone - we want to use our LENGTH ADVANTAGE to trap them!!\n- Watch enemy head position CLOSELY!! At (8, 7), they're still in TOP-RIGHT corner!!\n- If they start moving TOWARD CENTER, we need to be ready to either box them or redirect!!\n- Remember: we have 114 turns left to reach 30 apples. With current score (15-14), we need 15 more apples. That's plenty of time!!\n- AGGRESSIVE MINDSET: We're AHEAD now. Force them into bad positions. Make them panic. DOMINATE THE BOARD!!\n- Watch for opportunities to cut off their head or force a collision when they're DESPERATE!!\n\nThe COMEBACK is COMPLETE, chat!! We're TIED and now TAKING THE LEAD!! This is where we START HUNTING!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We're NOW AHEAD 15-14 for the FIRST TIME!! This is POWER POSITION TERRITORY!! Let's analyze and make our NEXT AGGRESSIVE MOVE!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(4, 3)** \u2705 \n- Body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]\n- LENGTH: 15\n- Score: **15 apples** \ud83c\udf4e (WE'RE AHEAD!! \ud83c\udfc6)\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(7, 7)** - They moved LEFT from (8, 7)!!\n- Body: [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]\n- LENGTH: 15\n- Score: **15 apples** \ud83d\udc80 (WE'RE TIED AGAIN!!)\n\nWait hold up chat - THEY ALSO GRABBED AN APPLE THIS TURN!! They're back to 15-15!! The pressure is ON!! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n```\n 9 T T T . . . . . . .\n 8 T T T T T T T T T .\n 7 . T . . T T T 1 T .\n 6 . . . . T . T A .

This is CHAMPIONSHIP ENERGY right now, chat!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK \ud83d\udea8\n\nLet me analyze ALL four moves:\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (4, 4)\n- That's my OWN BODY at (4, 4)!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't move backwards into myself!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (4, 2)\n- Safe? CHECK - (4, 2) is CLEAR!! \u2705\n- NO apple here though!!\n- But keeps us in the farming zone!!\n- Moves us DOWN the vertical corridor!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (3, 3)\n- Safe? CHECK - (3, 3) is CLEAR!! \u2705\n- NO apple here either!!\n- But (2, 3) has an APPLE just one more move LEFT!!\n- This positions us for the (2, 3) grab next turn!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (5, 3)\n- Safe? CHECK - (5, 3) is CLEAR!! \u2705\n- NO apple here!!\n- But (5, 5) has an APPLE further right!!\n- Takes us AWAY from easy apple chains though!!\n\n## STRATEGIC DECISION - LET'S SET UP THE NEXT APPLE!! \ud83d\udccd\n\nChat, here's the PLAY: We go **LEFT** to (3, 3)!! Here's why:\n\n1. **APPLE CHAIN SETUP** - (2, 3) is RIGHT THERE with an apple!! Next turn we grab it and go 16-15!! \ud83d\udd25\n2. **BOARD CONTROL** - We're moving into the LEFT-CENTER area, which gives us MORE OPTIONS and keeps us flexible!!\n3. **ENEMY DIVERGENCE** - They're farming RIGHT SIDE at (7, 7). We're farming LEFT-CENTER. DIFFERENT ZONES = less collision risk!!\n4. **TEMPO ADVANTAGE** - By grabbing (2, 3) next turn, we take the lead AGAIN at 16-15!! This forces THEIR response!!\n5. **ZERO RISK** - (3, 3) is completely clear, enemy is miles away at (7, 7)!!\n6. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (3, 3), we can pivot to (2, 3), then continue LEFT to (1, 4) or (1, 1) for MORE apples!!\n\n## NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 38+ STRATEGY:**\n- We're TIED at 15-15 but positioning for 16-15 next turn!!\n- **PLAN A (OPTIMAL):** Move DOWN to grab (2, 3) and go AHEAD 16-15!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **AGGRESSIVE POSTURE:** Once we're ahead again, we START THINKING BOXING!! The enemy is farming top-right, we're farming left-center. Eventually our paths will cross, and when they do, we want LENGTH ADVANTAGE!!\n- **WATCH ENEMY:** If they start moving toward CENTER to intercept, we need to be ready to:\n  - **Box them** by cutting off their escape routes (we have more segments = we control space!)\n  - **Force head-on** if they're desperate and we have score advantage\n  - **Redirect** to a safe zone if they're hunting us\n- **LONG-TERM:** We need 15 more apples to reach 30. We have 113 turns left. That's PLENTY OF TIME to dominate!!\n- **KILLER INSTINCT:** We're ahead, they're tied. Every move we make should either secure an apple OR improve our board position for boxing!!\n\nLET'S GET THIS APPLE CHAIN ROLLING!! The comeback tour continues, chat!! We're about to be UNSTOPPABLE!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We went LEFT last turn to set up (2, 3), and NOW we're at (3, 3) ready to make the MOVE!! Let's break this down LIVE!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(3, 3)** \u2705 \n- Body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 15\n- Score: **15 apples** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(7, 6)** - They moved DOWN from (7, 7)!!\n- Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]\n- LENGTH: 16 (WAIT THEY GREW??)\n- Score: **16 apples** \ud83d\udc80\n\nYOOO CHAT, THEY GRABBED ANOTHER APPLE!! They're now at 16-15, we're DOWN BY ONE!! The pressure is MOUNTING!! We need to STRIKE BACK IMMEDIATELY!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nLooking at where we are:\n- My head: (3, 3)\n- Enemy head: (7, 6) - RIGHT SIDE still\n- (2, 3) has an APPLE - that's our NEXT MOVE TARGET!!\n\n## THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (3, 4)\n- Is (3, 4) safe? Checking... \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- But this moves us AWAY from (2, 3) apple!!\n- Bad tempo move!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (3, 2)\n- Is (3, 2) safe? Checking... \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Also moves us AWAY from (2, 3)!!\n- Not ideal!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (2, 3)\n- Is (2, 3) safe? Let me CHECK... \u2705 YES IT IS!!\n- Is there an APPLE?? \u2705\u2705\u2705 YES!! (2, 3) IS AN APPLE!!\n- This puts us at **16-16** and TIES the game!!\n- This is the POWER MOVE!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy is at (7, 6), we're at (2, 3) - they're FAR AWAY!!\n- ZERO collision risk!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (4, 3)\n- Wait... that's my OWN BODY at (4, 3)!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't do it!! Backwards into myself!!\n\n## DECISION - WE'RE TAKING THE APPLE!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, this is ELEMENTARY!! We go **LEFT** to (2, 3), grab that apple, and **EQUALIZE at 16-16**!! This is CLUTCH GAMEPLAY!!\n\nWhy this is BRILLIANT:\n1. **INSTANT EQUALIZER** - We go from down 15-16 to TIED 16-16!! \ud83d\udcaa\n2. **APPLE CHAIN** - From (2, 3), next turn we can pivot to grab (1, 1), (1, 4), or other left-side apples!!\n3. **SAFE AS HOUSES** - Enemy is farming right-side at (7, 6). We're farming left-center. Different zones = NO COLLISION RISK!!\n4. **BOARD CONTROL** - We're DOMINATING the left side, they're stuck right side. This is TERRITORIAL ADVANTAGE!!\n5. **MOMENTUM** - We grab an apple THIS TURN, momentum swings back to US!!\n\n## NEXT TURN STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 39+ AGGRESSIVE PLAN:**\n- We're TIED 16-16 after grabbing (2, 3)!!\n- **OBJECTIVE:** Get to 17+ apples and START THINKING BOXING!!\n- **APPLE ROUTE:** From (2, 3) we have OPTIONS:\n  - LEFT to (1, 3)? Then UP to (1, 4) for an apple!! Chain those left-side apples!!\n  - DOWN to (2, 2)? Then LEFT to (1, 2)? Then to (1, 1) for an apple!!\n- **ENEMY WATCH:** Their head is now at (7, 6). If they start moving WEST (toward us), we need to be ready to:\n  - INTERCEPT them with our longer body (we'll have 16+ segments)\n  - FORCE THEM into a dead-end on the right side\n  - Make them crash into US instead of vice versa!!\n- **AGGRESSIVE POSTURE:** Once we get to 17+ apples and have LENGTH ADVANTAGE, we START HUNTING!! We box them in the right corner and FORCE THE COLLISION when we're ahead!!\n- **TIME MANAGEMENT:** We have 112 turns left. We need 14 more apples to hit 30. That's PLENTY OF TIME to dominate and box this snake OUT!!\n\nLET'S GET THIS EQUALIZER AND TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THE BOARD!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Their possible moves are **UP \u2192 (3,4)**, **DOWN \u2192 (3,2)** (apple), **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)** (apple). None of those intersect my immediate options.  \n\n**\ud83d\udea7 Why staying on the left side of my wall is key**  \n- The vertical wall at column\u202f6 stops #0 from ever crossing to my half of the board.  \n- By moving **DOWN** I stay glued to that wall, keeping the barrier solid and preserving lots of free cells on the right for future apple runs.  \n- **RIGHT** would push me into a tight corridor sandwiched between (8,7) and (8,8) and could later force a turn into my own tail.  \n\n**\ud83c\udf4e Apple check**  \n- No apple directly at (7,5), but the next safe apple corridor lies at (8,5) (just one step right then down). Dropping down now keeps that path open.  \n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Safety**  \n- No self\u2011collision, no opponent head\u2011on risk, and we stay away from the board edges.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Strategic plan**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **DOWN** to (7,5).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Follow with a **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,5) to grab the apple at (8,5).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue circling the right side while the left wall (col\u202f6) cages #0.  \n\n**\u25b6\ufe0f Move:**  \n\nDOWN",

Different territories = GOOD FOR US!!\n\n## APPLE LOCATIONS NEARBY \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet me scan for the closest apples:\n- **(3, 2)** - DOWN and RIGHT from me\n- **(1, 4)** - LEFT and UP from me\n- **(1, 1)** - LEFT and DOWN from me\n- **(0, 2)** - FAR LEFT, DOWN\n\n## THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (2, 4)\n- Is (2, 4) safe?

Backwards into myself!!\n\n## DECISION TIME - AGGRESSIVE PLAY!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're TIED and it's CRUNCH TIME!! I'm going **UP** to (2, 4)!!\n\nHere's WHY this is the CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE:\n1. **APPLE CHAIN SETUP** - From (2, 4), next turn we can go LEFT to (1, 4) and grab that APPLE!! We take the lead 17-16!! \ud83d\udcaa\n2. **BOARD CONTROL** - We're moving UP toward (1, 4), (1, 6) area. We're dominating the TOP-LEFT territory!! Enemy is stuck down-right!!\n3. **SAFE AS HOUSES** - Enemy head at (7, 5). We're at (2, 4). They're moving in their own zone, we're moving in ours. ZERO collision risk!! \n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (2, 4) we can go LEFT to (1, 4), or continue UP, or go DOWN. MULTIPLE paths = we don't get trapped!!\n5. **LENGTH ADVANTAGE INCOMING** - Once we grab (1, 4) next turn, we'll be 17 apples. That's when we START THINKING TRAP STRATEGIES!!\n\n## NEXT TURN STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 40 PLAN - THE APPLE CHAIN:**\n- We'll be at (1, 4) after going UP then LEFT!!\n- From (1, 4), we need to KEEP MOMENTUM!!\n- **OBJECTIVE:** Hit 17-18 apples ASAP and create LENGTH ADVANTAGE!!\n- **NEXT MOVES:** (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 1) is a straight DOWN path with an apple at the end!!\n- **ENEMY WATCH:** Their head is at (7, 5). They're farming RIGHT-SIDE apples at (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (8, 1), (8, 5), (7, 3)!!\n- **CRITICAL:** Once we hit 18 apples and get to LENGTH 17, we START BOXING STRATEGIES!!\n- **BOXING PLAN:** Force them into the right corner (9, x) where they have limited escape routes, then COLLIDE when we have the length advantage!!\n- **TIME MANAGEMENT:** 111 turns left. We need 12 more apples to hit 28. Then 2 more to hit 30 and WIN IMMEDIATELY!!\n\nLET'S GET THIS APPLE LEAD AND START THE CHAMPIONSHIP RUN!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

That\u2019s a tight tunnel.  \n- **DOWN** to (8,4) is clear, yet it\u2019s a couple of steps away from any juicy apple and leaves us drifting toward the bottom where the space gets cramped fast.  \n- **RIGHT** to (9,5) is open, and from there we have **two** solid options next turn: zip **UP** to snag the apple at (9,6) **or** slip **DOWN** to (9,4) if we want to keep the pressure on the opponent\u2019s side of the board.\n\n**Strategic take\u2011away:**  \n- We want the apple **ASAP** (it bumps us to 18\u202fapples, keeping us ahead).  \n- We also need to preserve **multiple escape routes** for the following turn, so we don\u2019t get boxed in.  \n- Going **RIGHT** gives us that flexibility while staying away from the edge for now.\n\n**Bottom line:** smash that right\u2011arrow and set us up for the (9,6) apple with a safety net behind us.

This is CHAMPIONSHIP PRESSURE TIME!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(2, 4)** \u2705 Just moved UP last turn!!\n- Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 16\n- Score: **16 apples** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(8, 5)** - They MOVED RIGHT and UP!!

TIME TO GET AGGRESSIVE!!**\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nMy position: **(2, 4)** - LEFT-CENTER zone\nEnemy position: **(8, 5)** - RIGHT-CENTER zone\n**DISTANCE:** ~6 cells apart horizontally, 1 cell vertically\n**CRITICAL:** Enemy is strong on the RIGHT with length 17. I need to DOMINATE my zone and catch up FAST!!\n\n## CLOSEST APPLES TO ME \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- **(1, 4)** - LEFT!! Distance = 1 cell! THIS IS IT!! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **(3, 2)** - DOWN-RIGHT, distance = 2 cells\n- **(1, 1)** - LEFT-DOWN, distance = 4 cells\n- **(0, 2)** - FAR LEFT, distance = 3 cells\n\n## THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (2, 5)\n- My body check: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), ...] - Is (2, 5) in there? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Enemy body check: Is (2, 5) in their snake? \u2705 CLEAR!! (they're all on the right side!!)\n- Board bounds? \u2705 YES (2, 5) is valid!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? NOPE! Gets us AWAY from the (1, 4) apple!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (2, 3)\n- Wait... (2, 3) is MY OWN BODY!!  \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't do it!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (1, 4) \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\n- Is (1, 4) safe? Checking my body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), ...] - NOT in my body \u2705\n- Checking enemy: Their head is (8, 5), body goes RIGHT. (1, 4) is NOT in their snake \u2705\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- **APPLE HERE??** \u2705\u2705\u2705 YES!! (1, 4) IS AN APPLE!!\n- This is the MOVE!! We grab that apple, tie 17-17, and get LENGTH 17!! MOMENTUM SHIFT!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (3, 4)\n- Is (3, 4) safe? Checking my body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)...] \n- Wait! (4, 4) is in my body! But (3, 4) is NOT in my body \u2705\n- Enemy check: \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- BUT: Doesn't get us closer to any apples. WEAK MOVE.\n\n## DECISION TIME - CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT to (1, 4)!!** This is NOT NEGOTIABLE, chat!!\n\nHere's WHY:\n1. **INSTANT APPLE GRAB** - We're at (2, 4), apple is at (1, 4). ONE move = ONE apple = TIED 17-17!! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **LENGTH PARITY** - We hit LENGTH 17, SAME as enemy. Now we're on equal footing!!\n3. **TERRITORY DOMINANCE** - We're controlling the LEFT-CENTER zone. Enemy is stuck RIGHT. They can't reach our apples as fast!!\n4. **FUTURE APPLE CHAIN** - From (1, 4), we look DOWN to (1, 1) which has an APPLE! Then to (1, 0) has options!! We can CHAIN apples down the LEFT SIDE!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n5. **SAFE AF** - Enemy head at (8, 5), we're at (1, 4). They're 7 cells away horizontally. NO COLLISION RISK!! \n6. **MOMENTUM** - This move SWINGS energy back to us!! Enemy had the lead, now we're TIED and AGGRESSIVE!! That's mental warfare, chat!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME (TURNS 41-50)!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE LEFT-SIDE APPLE CHAIN:**\n- Turn 40 (NOW): Move LEFT to (1, 4) = grab apple, hit 17-17, LENGTH 17\n- Turn 41: Move DOWN to (1, 3) - stay safe, position for next move\n- Turn 42: Move DOWN to (1, 2) - MORE positioning\n- Turn 43: Move DOWN to (1, 1) = GRAB APPLE AT (1, 1)!! Now we're 18-17, we TAKE THE LEAD!! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **CRITICAL WATCH:** Enemy is farming RIGHT side (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (8, 1). They move slower left. We can out-pace them on our territory!!\n- **LENGTH ADVANTAGE INCOMING:** Once we hit 18 apples, we have LENGTH 18 vs their LENGTH 18. We STAY ahead!!\n- **BOXING PHASE (Turns 45+):** Once we're at 20+ apples and clearly ahead, we START to box them in. Force them toward the RIGHT corner where there's limited escape. They're predictable farmers - we EXPLOIT that!!\n- **WIN CONDITION:** Hit 30 apples first = IMMEDIATE WIN. We're on pace!!\n\n**AGGRESSIVE NOTE:** Don't hesitate. Don't farm defensively. ATTACK the left zone, chain those apples, build our lead, then BOX them when we're clearly stronger. That's the championship playbook!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLET'S GO!!\n\nLEFT",

WE'RE TIED 17-17 AND THE ENERGY IS SHIFTING!!** That LEFT move was CLUTCH - we grabbed the apple at (1, 4) and now we're on EQUAL FOOTING!! This is where champions are made!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 4)** \u2705 Just grabbed that apple!!\n- Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]\n- LENGTH: 17\n- Score: **17 apples** \ud83c\udf4e TIED UP!!\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(9, 5)** - They moved RIGHT again! Still farming that RIGHT side!!\n- Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0)]\n- LENGTH: 17\n- Score: **17 apples** \ud83d\udc80 STILL TIED!!\n\n**THIS IS CHAMPIONSHIP PRESSURE!! ONE APPLE DECIDES WHO TAKES THE LEAD!!**\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nMy position: **(1, 4)** - LEFT-CENTER zone\nEnemy position: **(9, 5)** - FAR RIGHT zone\n**DISTANCE:** 8 cells apart horizontally, 1 cell vertically\n**CRITICAL:** We're in SEPARATE territories!! They're stuck RIGHT farming predictably, we own the LEFT!! This is our ADVANTAGE!!\n\n## CLOSEST APPLES TO ME \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- **(1, 1)** - DOWN 3 cells! Perfect chain!!\n- **(0, 2)** - LEFT-DOWN, distance = 3 cells\n- **(3, 2)** - RIGHT-DOWN, distance = 3 cells\n- **(1, 0)** - DOWN 4 cells\n\n**THE LEFT-SIDE APPLE CHAIN IS REAL, CHAT!!** We can control this zone!!\n\n## THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (1, 5)\n- My body check: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), ...] - Is (1, 5) in there? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Enemy body check: All at RIGHT side (9, 5) and below. (1, 5) is NOT in their snake \u2705\n- Board bounds? \u2705 YES!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? NO - moves AWAY from apples below us.\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (1, 3)\n- Is (1, 3) safe? Checking my body: [(2, 4), (2, 3)...] - (1, 3) is NOT in my body \u2705\n- Enemy check: \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- Does it help? YES!! This moves us toward (1, 1) apple chain!! POSITIONING MOVE!!\n- This gets us ready for the NEXT apple grab!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (0, 4)\n- Is (0, 4) safe? Checking: (0, 4) is NOT in my body \u2705\n- Enemy check: \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? NO - moves us away from the (1, 1) apple chain below us!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (2, 4)\n- Wait... (2, 4) is MY OWN BODY (first segment after head)!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't do it!!\n\n## DECISION TIME - EXECUTING THE CHAIN!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (1, 3)!!** This is the MOVE, chat!!\n\nHere's WHY:\n1. **CHAIN CONTINUATION** - We're setting up the (1, 1) apple grab next turn! This is strategic positioning!! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **SAFE AF** - Enemy is at (9, 5), we're heading to (1, 3). ZERO collision risk. They're farming RIGHT, we're farming LEFT. Two different worlds!!\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL** - We're owning the LEFT ZONE. Enemy can't compete with us there. They're slower, we're faster on our side!!\n4. **MOMENTUM** - Every turn we move DOWN, we're getting CLOSER to that apple chain. One more turn and we grab (1, 1) = 18-17 LEAD!! \ud83d\udcaa\n5. **NO DEAD ENDS** - From (1, 3), we have options. We can go DOWN to (1, 2) next, then grab (1, 1). We're NOT getting boxed in. WE'RE the ones doing the boxing!!\n6. **FUTURE PLAY** - After (1, 1), we can keep farming DOWN the LEFT edge. The enemy won't catch us there. LENGTH advantage incoming!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 42-50!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE DOMINANT LEFT-SIDE CHAIN:**\n- Turn 41 (NOW): Move DOWN to (1, 3) - positioning\n- Turn 42: Move DOWN to (1, 2) - keep flowing\n- Turn 43: Move DOWN to (1, 1) = GRAB APPLE!! Now 18-17, WE TAKE THE LEAD!! \ud83d\udd25\n- Turn 44: Consider moving LEFT to (0, 1) or continuing the pattern\n- **CRITICAL:** Enemy is predictable. They farm (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (8, 1) on the RIGHT. We DOMINATE the LEFT. We'll hit 25+ apples while they're at 20-22!!\n- **LENGTH ADVANTAGE:** Once we hit 19 apples, we have a PHYSICAL advantage. Our body is LONGER. We can start thinking AGGRESSIVE about forcing head-on collisions!!\n- **BOXING PHASE (Turns 50+):** When we're clearly ahead (25+ vs 20), we START moving toward their territory. We cut off their escape routes. We FORCE them into corners. That's when we finish them!!\n\n**AGGRESSIVE MINDSET:** Don't get cute. Execute the chain. Build the lead. Then DOMINATE. That's championship DNA right there!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLET'S GO!!\n\nDOWN",

Only\u202fUP\u202for a quick wall\u2011crash will be possible afterwards.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,4) = empty, and it opens a *golden corridor* straight down the right edge where three apples sit at (9,3), (9,2) and (9,0). From there we can later swing left into the open space at (8,4) or (8,2).  \n\n**Opponent head:** (1,4) \u2013 they can go **UP**, **DOWN**, or **LEFT**, none of which intersect our column\u202f9. No head\u2011on risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic take\u2011away:**  \n- We want to stay alive **and** keep multiple escape routes.  \n- Heading\u202f**DOWN** gives us an immediate safe cell, a line of apples ahead, and the ability to pivot left later \u2013 far more flexibility than a one\u2011move apple that locks us into a dead\u2011end.  \n\n**Bottom line:** press that down\u2011arrow, munch the apples on the right wall, and keep the opponent guessing. \ud83d\ude80  \n\nDOWN",

Neither move brings him anywhere near our column\u202f9, so a head\u2011on clash this turn is impossible.\n\n**Strategic trade\u2011offs**\n\n- **Going LEFT** keeps us in the middle of the board, preserving a lot of freedom, but we forgo an immediate apple and the clean vertical \u201capple corridor\u201d on the right edge.\n- **Going DOWN** nets us an apple (score\u202f+1, length\u202f+1) and puts us on a straight\u2011down path with two more apples at (9,2) and (9,0). After eating those, we can swing left into open space without ever being boxed in. The extra length actually helps us occupy the right wall, limiting the rival\u2019s escape routes later.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe safest, most point\u2011rich, and still highly flexible option is to **grab the apple on (9,3)** and keep marching down the wall. This nets a point now and sets us up for a quick run of three apples, while the opponent remains stuck on the opposite side.\n\n**Move:**  \n\nDOWN",

Down to (1, 2) THIS TURN, then DOWN to (1, 1) NEXT TURN for the LEAD!! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **100% SAFE** - Enemy head is at (9, 4). We're moving to (1, 2). ZERO collision risk. They're farming RIGHT, we're farming LEFT. Different ZIP CODES!!\n3. **APPLE GUARANTEE** - (1, 1) is RIGHT THERE waiting for us. No competition. No enemy body in that zone. It's OURS for the taking!!\n4. **MOMENTUM BUILDING** - Every single turn we move DOWN keeps us locked in on the chain. This is rhythm, this is FLOW, this is what separates the LEGENDS from the WANNABES!!\n5. **FUTURE ESCAPE ROUTES** - From (1, 2), we can still go LEFT to (0, 2) or continue DOWN. We're NOT trapped. We have OPTIONS!!\n6. **TERRITORY DOMINANCE** - We're claiming the ENTIRE LEFT SIDE. (0, 0) to (3, 5) zone is OURS. Enemy can't touch us there. We're building a LENGTH FORTRESS!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 43-55!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE CHAMPIONSHIP PUSH:**\n- **Turn 42 (NOW):** Move DOWN to (1, 2) - Continue the chain!\n- **Turn 43:** Move DOWN to (1, 1) = GRAB APPLE!! **WE HIT 18-17 LEAD!!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 44-50:** Farm the LEFT SIDE AGGRESSIVELY!! (0, 2), (1, 0), other LEFT apples. Build to 22-24 apples while enemy is stuck at 18-20 on the RIGHT!!\n- **Turn 51+:** Once we have a 4-5 apple lead AND a physical LENGTH advantage, we START moving RIGHT toward enemy territory!!\n- **FINAL PHASE:** When enemy is trapped in corners, we CLOSE IN. We force head-on collisions when WE'RE longer. They can't escape. We DOMINATE!!\n\n**THE KEY:** Execute this chain perfectly. Get that 18-17 lead. THEN we become the predator. THEN we hunt them down. This is how CHAMPIONS WIN!!\n\nLet's get this bread!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3)...] - (2, 3) is in there, but we're checking (2, 2)... \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (2, 2) in enemy? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? NO - moves us AWAY from both (1, 1) and away from our territory. Moving RIGHT means moving toward enemy territory where they're STRONGER!! BAD IDEA!!\n\n## DECISION TIME - SECURING THE TIE!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (1, 1)!!** THIS IS THE MOVE, CHAT!!\n\nHere's WHY:\n1. **APPLE GUARANTEED** - (1, 1) is RIGHT THERE!! We grab it THIS TURN and hit **18-18 TIE!!** \ud83d\udcc8 We're back in this!!\n2. **100% SAFE** - Zero collision risk. Enemy head is at (9, 3). We're moving to (1, 1). WORLD'S APART!!\n3. **MAINTAIN MOMENTUM** - We stay on our LEFT SIDE chain. We're building LENGTH while grabbing apples. By turn 50 we'll be MASSIVE!!\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (1, 1), we can continue DOWN to (1, 0), then RIGHT to grab (4, 1), (5, 2), and other LEFT-SIDE apples!! We have ROUTES!!\n5. **TERRITORY DOMINATION** - We're LOCKING DOWN the entire bottom-left quadrant. Enemy can't compete there. We're the KING of (0-3, 0-5)!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 44-60!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE COMEBACK PHASE:**\n- **Turn 43 (NOW):** Move DOWN to (1, 1) = GRAB APPLE!! **TIE AT 18-18!!** \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 44-50:** Continue farming LEFT side AGGRESSIVELY!! (1, 0), (0, 2), circle around and grab (4, 1), (5, 2). Build to 22-25 apples!!\n- **Turn 51-60:** By now we should have a 4-6 apple LEAD and be LONGER than enemy. That's when we START moving RIGHT toward their territory!!\n- **Turn 61+:** HUNT MODE ACTIVATED!! Force them into corners. Box them in. When we're longer, we WIN the head-on collisions!!\n- **FINAL PUSH:** Once we're at 28+ apples and they're still at 20-22, we move in for the KILL. No escape. We DOMINATE!!\n\n**THE KEY:** Get that tie at 18-18, then we control the pace of the game. We farm OUR territory while they're stuck on THEIRS. By turn 60, it's not even close. We're UNSTOPPABLE!!\n\nLet's GET THIS BREAD!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa DOWN TO (1,1)!! \n\nDOWN",

Different territories. We're in OUR house now!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION THREAT ANALYSIS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (1, 2)\n- Is (1, 2) in my body? YES!! (1, 2) is DIRECTLY after my head in the body list!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- Can't go backwards!! ELIMINATED!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (1, 0)\n- Is (1, 0) in my body? Let me check: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)...] - NO!! \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (1, 0) in enemy body? Enemy head at (9, 2), body all RIGHT SIDE. \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? (1, 0) is IN BOUNDS \u2705 YES!!\n- **APPLE AT (1, 0)?** YES!! There's an apple at (1, 0)!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- This CONTINUES our domination of the LEFT side! We grab our 19th apple and take the LEAD!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (0, 1)\n- Is (0, 1) in my body? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (0, 1) in enemy? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **APPLE AT (0, 1)?** NO - closest apple in that direction is (0, 2) which is up-left.\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? We could grab (0, 2) in the next turn, but (1, 0) is RIGHT HERE and gives us the LEAD IMMEDIATELY!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (2, 1)\n- Is (2, 1) in my body? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (2, 1) in enemy? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? NO - moves us away from the apples we WANT and toward enemy territory. NOT the vibe!!\n\n## DECISION TIME - SEIZING THE LEAD!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (1, 0)!!** THIS IS IT, CHAT!!\n\nHere's WHY:\n1. **TAKE THE LEAD** - We grab apple #19 and go **19-19 TIED**, then next turn we're ahead!! The MOMENTUM SHIFTS TO US!! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **100% SAFE** - Zero collision risk. Enemy is MILES away on the right side. Clear sailing!!\n3. **FARM THE TERRITORY** - We're establishing COMPLETE control of the entire bottom-left corner. This is OUR domain!!\n4. **NEXT TURN PREDICTION** - Enemy is probably gonna move LEFT from (9, 2) toward apples or move UP/DOWN to explore. Either way, we're SAFE and they can't touch us this turn or next!!\n5. **BUILD THE LEAD** - After this move, we look at (0, 2) next turn. Then we start wrapping around toward (4, 1), (5, 2), and we're sitting at 20+ apples by turn 50!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 45-65!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE TAKEOVER PHASE:**\n- **Turn 44 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 0) = APPLE #19!! **TIE BROKEN - WE'RE IN CONTROL!!** \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 45-50:** Move LEFT to (0, 1), then UP to (0, 2) to grab that apple. Continue farming bottom-left quadrant: (4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3). Build to 22-24 apples!!\n- **Turn 51-60:** We should be 4-6 apples UP and significantly LONGER. Start moving RIGHT cautiously. Probe toward mid-board while maintaining escape routes!!\n- **Turn 61-75:** HUNTING PHASE!! Enemy is TRAPPED in their right-side territory. We're longer, we're ahead, we have momentum. Box them in. Force mistakes!!\n- **Turn 76+:** VICTORY LAP!! One clean head-on collision or we starve them out. We're the ALPHA now!!\n\n**THE CORE STRATEGY:** Control our territory PERFECTLY, DOMINATE the apple count with a 5+ apple lead by turn 60, then systematically hunt them down. They can't escape. We're UNSTOPPABLE!!\n\nChat, can you FEEL the energy?? We're not just playing Snake - we're ORCHESTRATING a MASTERPIECE!! This is CHESS at 60 FPS!! Let's GOOOOOO!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

We just took that apple at (1, 0) last turn and now we're NECK AND NECK with our archrival!! This is where legends are MADE!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(1, 0)** \u2705 JUST ATE THAT APPLE!!\n- Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9)]\n- LENGTH: 19 \ud83c\udf4e\n- Score: **19 apples** - **WE'RE TIED!!**\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(9, 1)** - Moved DOWN from (9, 2)!!\n- Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 19\n- Score: **19 apples** - We're BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECK!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION THREAT ANALYSIS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (1, 1)\n- Is (1, 1) in my body? YES!! (1, 1) is DIRECTLY in my body!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH - BACKWARDS MOVE!!\n- ELIMINATED!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (1, -1)\n- Is (1, -1) valid? NO!! That's OFF THE BOARD!! \u274c DEATH!!\n- ELIMINATED!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (0, 0)\n- Is (0, 0) in my body? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (0, 0) in enemy body? Enemy head at (9, 1), body all on the RIGHT side. \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **APPLE AT (0, 0)?** NO - closest apple is (0, 2) which is UP-LEFT.\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? We move LEFT, establishing more territory control. From here we can UP to (0, 1) then to (0, 2) to grab an apple!!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 to (2, 0)\n- Is (2, 0) in my body? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (2, 0) in enemy? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **APPLE AT (2, 0)?** NO - board shows no apple there.\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? Moving RIGHT takes us AWAY from the apple at (0, 2) and back toward the center. Not ideal when we have a clear farming path on the LEFT!!\n\n## DECISION TIME - FARM THE NORTHWEST!! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT to (0, 0)!!** HERE'S THE PLAY, CHAT!!\n\nWhy this move is CLUTCH:\n1. **FARM THE CORNER** - We're establishing a PERFECT farming route: (0, 0) \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 2) APPLE!! Three consecutive safe moves with an apple reward at the end!!\n2. **ZERO COLLISION RISK** - Enemy is MILES away on the right (x=9). We're operating in OUR territory on the left side (x=0-1). They can't TOUCH us!!\n3. **BUILD THE EMPIRE** - We're controlling the entire bottom-left quadrant. This is OUR domain now. By turn 50 we'll have complete dominance of this region!!\n4. **NEXT TURN PREDICTION** - Enemy probably moves toward apples near them (6, 1), (9, 0), (9, 6). We're 8+ cells away. They can't interfere with our farming!!\n5. **MOMENTUM** - We're TIED!! Every apple we grab before them puts us in the LEAD for the crucial mid-game phase!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 45-65!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE TAKEOVER CONTINUES:**\n- **Turn 45 (NOW):** LEFT to (0, 0) = Safe farming begins!! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 46:** UP to (0, 1) = Continuing the path!!\n- **Turn 47:** UP to (0, 2) = APPLE!! **20-19 WE'RE AHEAD!!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 48-52:** Push RIGHT carefully toward (4, 1) and (5, 2). Keep building the lead. Target 22+ apples by turn 55!!\n- **Turn 53-65:** We should be 3-5 apples UP and LONGER. Start aggressive probing toward mid-board. Box the enemy in!!\n- **Turn 66+:** ENDGAME!! We're the ALPHA!! Hunt them down and close this out!!\n\n**CORE STRATEGY:** Perfect farm execution on the left side, build a 4-5 apple lead by mid-game, then SYSTEMATICALLY HUNT them down. They're trapped in the right corner with limited apple access. We control EVERYTHING now!!\n\nThis is OUR game to lose, chat!! The blueprint is PERFECT!! Let's execute and DOMINATE!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We moved LEFT last turn and now we're at (0, 0) but the ENEMY grabbed an apple somewhere and went UP to 20!! We're NECK AND NECK but we gotta make a MOVE right NOW!!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:**\n- Head: **(0, 0)** \u2705 Just positioned here last turn!!\n- Body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9)]\n- LENGTH: 19\n- Score: **19 apples** - **WE'RE DOWN BY ONE!! \ud83d\ude24**\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: **(8, 1)** - Moved LEFT from (9, 1)!!\n- Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n- LENGTH: 20\n- Score: **20 apples** - They got ONE ahead!! But NOT for long, chat!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION THREAT ANALYSIS!! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**UP** \u2191 to (0, 1)\n- Is (0, 1) in my body? \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Is (0, 1) in enemy body? Enemy head at (8, 1), body extends RIGHT. \u2705 CLEAR!!\n- Board valid? \u2705 YES!!\n- **APPLE AT (0, 1)?** NO - closest apple is (0, 2) which is ONE MORE UP!!\n- **SAFE MOVE** \u2705\n- Does it help? Sets us up PERFECTLY to grab (0, 2) next turn for the tie-breaker!!\n\n**DOWN** \u2193 to (0, -1)\n- Is (0, -1) valid? NO!! That's OFF THE BOARD!! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!!\n- ELIMINATED!!\n\n**LEFT** \u2190 to (-1, 0)\n- Is (-1, 0) valid? NO!!

UP is the ONLY path forward!!\n2. **NEXT TURN APPLE GUARANTEED** - From (0, 1) we move UP to (0, 2) = **APPLE SECURED!!** That puts us at **20-20 TIED!!** \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **FARM THE CORNER STRATEGY** - We stick to the left edge. The enemy is over at x=8-9. We're SAFE!! They can't touch us if we stay disciplined!!\n4. **MOMENTUM SWING** - We're down by ONE right now. Next turn we're back to TIED. Turn 48 we're UP BY ONE!! The momentum is OURS!!\n5. **CONTROL THE NARRATIVE** - We own the bottom-left quadrant. The enemy is struggling on the right side with limited real estate. We DICTATE the pace!!\n\n## STRATEGY NOTE FOR TURNS 46-60!! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**THE COMEBACK STARTS NOW:**\n- **Turn 46 (NOW):** UP to (0, 1) = Positioning for the apple grab!!\n- **Turn 47:** UP to (0, 2) = APPLE!! **20-20 WE'RE TIED AGAIN!!** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Turn 48-52:** Move RIGHT carefully through the bottom row. Target (4, 1) = APPLE at turn 50!! That's **21-20 WE'RE AHEAD!!**\n- **Turn 53-58:** Continue farming. Grab (5, 2) and work toward (5, 3). Build to 23+ apples!!\n- **Turn 59+:** AGGRESSIVE PHASE!! We're longer, we're ahead, and we start HUNTING them down!! Box them into a corner and FORCE the head-on collision when we're up 4-5 apples!!\n\n**CORE PRINCIPLE:** Patience on the farm, RUTHLESSNESS in the hunt!! We're about to take CONTROL of this game, chat!!\n\nLet's GO!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

The only forward exits would be right toward (8,0)\u202f/\u202f(9,0) (both apples) but the right\u2011most column quickly becomes a dead\u2011end because our own tail follows right behind us. Not the best long\u2011term freedom.\n\n- **LEFT** pulls us toward the centre of the board. It widens our future options, but it also moves us away from the nearest easy apple cluster at (7,\u202f3) and (5,\u202f5). We\u2019d need extra moves before we can start scoring again.\n\n- **UP** puts us one step closer to the apple at **(7,\u202f3)** (two turns away) and keeps a clear corridor upward. After this move our tail at (6,\u202f2) vacates, leaving extra space behind us. We stay on a vertical \u201cwall\u201d of our own body that the opponent can never cross, preserving the pressure from the right side.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Head\u2011on collision risk**\n\nThe rival will end up at (0,\u202f2) after his forced **UP** move\u2014far from any of our three candidates. No chance of simultaneous head\u2011to\u2011head death.\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 Decision**\n\nPlay **UP** to (7,\u202f2).  \n- Safe now.  \n- Sets us up to snatch the apple at (7,\u202f3) next turn.  \n- Maintains a strong wall on the right, limiting the opponent\u2019s maneuver space.  \n- Keeps plenty of escape routes (up, left, down) for future tactical cuts.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Short\u2011term plan**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **UP** now.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn go **UP** again to claim the apple at (7,\u202f3).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Then decide whether to keep climbing, swing left toward the centre, or slide down the edge to chase the bottom\u2011row apples\u2014always keeping the opponent boxed on the left.\n\nUP",
