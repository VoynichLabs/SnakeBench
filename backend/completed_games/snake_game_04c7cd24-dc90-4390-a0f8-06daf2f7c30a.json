Moving **UP** to (7, 8) would get the snake closer to the apple at (7, 3) but would not consume it. Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 9) would not get the snake closer to any apple, but it would keep it moving forward.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary backtracking and to keep moving steadily towards the apple, the best move would be to continue moving towards the apple at (7, 3) by moving **UP**. This will keep the snake moving forward and potentially closer to the apple.\n\nMy decided next move: UP",
