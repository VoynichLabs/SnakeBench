Move LEFT to collect the apple at (8, 7).\n2. After collecting this apple, analyze the position of the enemy snake and available paths to avoid collisions.\n3. Based on the new configuration, I can next aim for either the apple left at (3, 7) or maneuver around the board edges towards the other remaining apples.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- Moving LEFT does border the enemy snake\u2019s current trajectory, potentially putting my snake into a risky position in future turns.

The enemy's head is at (8, 1), which is significantly far from my current position.\n- Moving LEFT is strategic for both short and long-term play. It offers immediate growth and points without compromising safety.\n- Future planning: After securing the apple at (8, 7), further plans depend on the enemy snake movements and my subsequent position. Ideally, I would reposition towards the center or upper parts of the board to position effectively for more apples.\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- After moving LEFT and collecting the apple at (8, 7), reassess if I should target the apple at (3, 7) or navigate towards the board's outer perimeters to avoid any risk from the enemy snake and select another apple from those available.\n- Continue to maintain spatial awareness to avoid trapping myself and carefully monitor the enemy snake's position and direction to avoid sudden conflicts.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Snake #2 is closer to the upper apples (such as (6,7), (3,7)), thus it would be best to first target the lower apples closer to my current position to avoid enemy conflict and secure safe growth.\n\nChoosing direction:\n- Left is (8,1), occupied by my current body, so that's unsafe.\n- Right is outside the board at (10,1); cannot move there.\n- Down is (9,0): appears open from the state board; but let's verify carefully: positions around are [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0)] from my body. (9,0) itself seems empty. Down seems safe initially.\n- Up is (9,2): seems empty and safe as no immediate threats are present.\n\nStrategizing the optimal move:\n- Moving DOWN would put me at (9,0). Then I can try moving LEFT on subsequent turns towards apple at (3,0).\n- Moving UP toward (9,2) is safe too, but I'd be going away from all close apples. It may be a detour delaying my eating opportunities.\n- Thus, DOWN is the more strategic route to quickly target the closest apple at (3,0).\n\nNext move strategy reminder for next turns:\n- Move left after going DOWN to head towards apple at (3,0).\n- Monitor enemy snake #2 to evaluate risk of crossing paths near the upper-middle apples later.\n\nConclusion:\nThe best strategic and safe move this turn is DOWN.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
