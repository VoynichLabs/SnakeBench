Wait, I must check if it\u2019s safe *this turn*:  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - No body there currently.  \n  - Could enemy head move into (1, 8) this turn? Enemy at (0, 8) could move RIGHT to (1, 8). That would be a head-on collision if I go UP to (1, 8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 8). That kills both. So UP is *unsafe* due to possible head-on collision.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 6) \u2013 empty, no enemy body, not off board. Enemy at (0, 8) cannot reach (1, 6) in one move. Safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 7) \u2013 empty, not off board. Enemy at (0, 8) could move DOWN to (0, 7) \u2013 that\u2019s a head-on collision if I go LEFT to (0, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 7). So LEFT is unsafe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 7) \u2013 empty, not off board. Enemy at (0, 8) cannot reach (2, 7) in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for apples and future options:**  \n\nApples:  \n- Closest apple to me is (3, 8) (distance 3 in Manhattan terms), but that\u2019s up/right.  \n- (7, 8) far.  \n- (0, 2) far.  \n- (4, 4) is closer in y-difference but far in x.  \n- (8, 8) far.  \n\nFrom (1, 7):  \n- DOWN (1, 6): moves away from most apples (all apples are y \u2265 8 or y=4 or y=2).  \n- RIGHT (2, 7): moves slightly closer to (3, 8) and (7, 8) horizontally, keeps y=7, which is closer to y=8 apples than y=6 is.  \n\nFuture options:  \n- From (2, 7): can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT next turn unless blocked.  \n- From (1, 6): can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT next turn unless blocked.  \n\nBut (1, 6) is farther from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy at (0, 8) likely wants apple at (3, 8) or (0, 2).  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 8), that\u2019s fine for me if I\u2019m not there.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (0, 7), that\u2019s fine for me if I\u2019m not there.  \n\nI should avoid moving into cells enemy might go to unless necessary.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Choose:**  \nRIGHT puts me at (2, 7), closer to apples, safe from head-on collision (enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 7) in one move from (0, 8)), and gives more central position.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7), consider moving UP toward apple at (3, 8) if safe, but check enemy\u2019s possible moves from wherever it ends up after this turn.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

So I'm just a head.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at head (1,7) with no body.\n- Apples at: (3,8), (4,4), (7,8), (0,2), (8,8)\n\n**Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (0,8)**\n- UP: (0,9) - within board? Yes (y=9 is top row). Check collisions: no snakes there (enemy is at (1,7)). Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there? Enemy is at (1,7) which is adjacent but not same. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) - off board (x=-1). Dies. Not safe.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo unsafe moves: LEFT (off board). Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, which is best?\n\nConsider apples:\n- (3,8) is to the right at same y=8. So moving RIGHT gets me closer to that apple.\n- (0,2) is below, but far away.\n- Others are not very close.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake at (1,7). It can move UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6), LEFT to (0,7) or RIGHT to (2,7).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,8):\n- Enemy might move UP to (1,8) causing head-on collision? Both die. So risky.\n- Enemy might also move LEFT to (0,7) which is safe for them.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,7):\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (0,7) causing head-on collision? Both die. Risky.\n- Enemy might also move DOWN to (1,6) or others.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,9):\n- Enemy cannot reach (0,9) in one move (they are at (1,7)). So no immediate collision risk.\n- But (0,9) is an edge, which might limit future moves? But currently safe.\n\nSo UP is safest in terms of avoiding immediate head-on collision.\n\nAlso, UP moves me away from the enemy, and I can then plan to go right towards apples from top row.\n\nDOWN is also safe but closer to enemy and might risk collision.\n\nRIGHT is towards apple but risky due to potential head-on.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nAlso, long-term: I need to collect apples. After UP to (0,9), next turn I can go RIGHT to (1,9) and then down to (1,8) etc to approach (3,8) and other apples.\n\nEnemy is at (1,7), so they might go for (3,8) as well? But I can avoid direct conflict for now.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving UP to (0,9), consider going RIGHT to (1,9) to stay along top edge and then approach the apples at (3,8) and (7,8). Avoid descending too early where enemy might be.\n\nSo final move: UP\n\nUP",

Dies. Not safe.\n- DOWN: (0,8) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there? Enemy is at (2,7), not (0,8). Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,9) - off board (x=-1). Dies. Not safe.\n- RIGHT: (1,9) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo unsafe moves: UP (off board), LEFT (off board). Safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, which is best?\n\nConsider apples:\n- (3,8) is at y=8, so moving DOWN to (0,8) gets me closer to that apple (same y-level).\n- (0,2) is below, but far.\n- (8,8) is far right.\n- (4,4) is down and right.\n- (7,8) is right.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake at (2,7). It can move UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,8):\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (1,7) which is adjacent, but no direct collision.\n- Enemy might move UP to (2,8) which is not directly conflicting.\n- No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,9):\n- Enemy cannot reach (1,9) in one move (they are at (2,7)). So safe.\n- However, (1,9) is an edge, which might limit future moves? But currently safe.\n\nNow, which move is better for apple collection?\n- Moving DOWN to (0,8) puts me at same y as (3,8) and (7,8). I can then move right along y=8 to reach these apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,9) is top row, and I would need to go down to y=8 to get apples, which might take an extra turn.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (2,7), which is close to (3,8). They might go for (3,8) soon. So I should try to get there first.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (0,8) is more direct towards the closest apple (3,8).\n\nFuture moves: After DOWN to (0,8), next turn I can move RIGHT to (1,8) and then to (2,8), (3,8) to eat the apple. Enemy might be moving towards (3,8) as well, but I have a shorter path.\n\nEnemy might go UP to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,7). If they go UP to (2,8), then when I go to (1,8) and then (2,8), we might have a head-on collision? But that is two turns away, and I can adjust later.\n\nFor now, DOWN is safe and gets me closer to the apple.\n\nRIGHT is safe but less efficient.\n\nSo choose DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (0,8), next turn move RIGHT to (1,8) to approach (3,8). Be aware of enemy at (2,7) who might move to (2,8) or (3,7). If enemy moves to (2,8), consider going to (1,8) and then perhaps wait or go to (1,9) to avoid head-on? But that is for next turn to decide.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,6): empty, on board. Enemy cannot reach in one move. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,7): empty, on board. Enemy at (0,9) could move RIGHT to (1,9) or DOWN to (0,8), not (1,7). Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,7): empty, on board. Enemy cannot reach in one move. Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe from immediate collision with enemy body or board edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider possible head-on collisions this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (0,9) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 off board (dies) \u2013 unlikely.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,8) \u2013 safe for me unless I go there (I\u2019m not).  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board (dies) \u2013 unlikely.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,9) \u2013 safe for me unless I go there (I\u2019m not).  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision with enemy head this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nApples: (3,8), (4,4), (7,8), (0,2), (8,8).  \n\nFrom (2,7):  \n- UP (2,8): gets closer to (3,8) (distance now: |2-3|+|8-8|=1).  \n- DOWN (2,6): away from most apples.  \n- LEFT (1,7): slightly away from most apples except (0,2) but far.  \n- RIGHT (3,7): closer to (3,8) (distance now: |3-3|+|7-8|=1) and also closer to (4,4),(7,8).  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT put me 1 step from an apple next turn:  \n- UP to (2,8): apple at (3,8) is 1 step right.  \n- RIGHT to (3,7): apple at (3,8) is 1 step up.  \n\nBut UP to (2,8) is slightly riskier next turn because enemy at (0,9) might move to (1,9) or (0,8), still not adjacent to (2,8), but after my move to (2,8), enemy could possibly move into (2,8) next turn if they go RIGHT then DOWN? Let\u2019s check: enemy at (0,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 then next turn from (1,9) could go DOWN to (1,8) or RIGHT to (2,9) etc., not directly into (2,8) except in two turns. So not an immediate risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Choose best move:**  \n\nUP puts me at (2,8) adjacent to apple (3,8) horizontally. Next turn I could go RIGHT to eat it, but need to check enemy\u2019s possible position then.  \nRIGHT puts me at (3,7) adjacent to apple (3,8) vertically. Next turn I could go UP to eat it.  \n\nBoth are equally close to that apple. However, UP gives me y=8, which is also closer to other apples at y=8 ((7,8),(8,8)).  \nAlso, being at y=8 might make me more visible to enemy, but enemy is at (0,9) far left.  \n\nI think UP is slightly better because:  \n1. It keeps me in the row with 3 apples (y=8).  \n2. From (2,8) I have three safe directions next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) unless enemy moves into one.  \n3. Eating apple next turn likely possible unless enemy moves to (3,8) this turn (unlikely from (0,9)).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (2,8), next turn check if apple (3,8) still there. If yes, consider RIGHT to eat it, but first verify no head-on collision risk with enemy\u2019s possible move to (3,8) from wherever enemy ends up after this turn. If risky, maybe go DOWN or LEFT to stay safe and plan longer route. Priority: stay alive, eat when safe.  \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 1) is at head (0,8) with no body.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at head (2,8) with no body.\n- Apples at: (3,8), (4,4), (7,8), (0,2), (8,8)\n\n**Possible moves from (0,8): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- UP: (0,9) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there? Enemy is at (2,8), not (0,9). Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) - off board (x=-1). Dies. Not safe.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there? Enemy is at (2,8), which is adjacent but not same cell. Safe.\n\nSo unsafe moves: LEFT (off board). Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, which is best?\n\nConsider apples:\n- (3,8) is at y=8, same row. Moving RIGHT to (1,8) gets me closer to that apple (only 2 steps away).\n- (0,2) is below, but far.\n- (8,8) is far right.\n- (4,4) is down and right.\n- (7,8) is right.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake at (2,8). It can move UP to (2,9), DOWN to (2,7), LEFT to (1,8), or RIGHT to (3,8).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,8):\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (1,8) as well -> head-on collision! Both die.\n- So moving RIGHT is risky because enemy might choose LEFT.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,9):\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (1,8) or RIGHT to (3,8) or UP/DOWN. No direct collision risk.\n- But (0,9) is top-left corner, which might limit future moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,7):\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (1,8) or other directions. No direct collision risk.\n- Moves me away from the apples on y=8.\n\nTo avoid head-on collision with enemy, I should not move RIGHT to (1,8) because enemy might move LEFT to (1,8). That would kill both.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is not safe due to potential head-on collision.\n\nSo safe moves without immediate death: UP and DOWN.\n\nNow compare UP and DOWN:\n- UP to (0,9): top edge. From there, next moves: only DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT off, UP off). So limited options.\n- DOWN to (0,7): more open. Next moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT off). Better options.\n\nAlso, apples: (0,2) is below, but far. (3,8) is above. But moving DOWN avoids the enemy conflict.\n\nEnemy is at (2,8) and likely to go for (3,8) apple? They might move RIGHT to (3,8) to eat it. Or they might move LEFT to (1,8) to block me.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,7), I can then go to (0,6) or (1,7) to avoid the enemy and perhaps go for (0,2) or (4,4) later.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,9), I am trapped in corner and might have to come down later.\n\nSo DOWN is better for flexibility.\n\nAlso, enemy might not move LEFT to (1,8) if they see the apple at (3,8) and move RIGHT. But we cannot rely on that.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, avoid RIGHT. Choose DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (0,7), next turn I can move RIGHT to (1,7) to get away from the edge and have more options. Then consider going towards (4,4) or (0,2). Avoid enemy at (2,8) who might be moving towards apples on top.\n\nDOWN",

Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, which is best?\n\nConsider apples:\n- (0,2) is below: moving DOWN gets closer.\n- (4,4) and (4,5) are down-right.\n- (7,8) and (8,8) are far right and up.\n\nEnemy snake at (3,8) with body (2,8). It can move UP to (3,9), DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8) (but that is its body? Actually, moving LEFT to (2,8) would hit its own body and die. So enemy cannot move LEFT. Similarly, cannot move backwards into its body. So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (to (4,8)).\nEnemy might go for (7,8) or (8,8) apples by moving RIGHT.\n\nNow, my moves:\n- UP to (0,8): top edge. From there, next moves: only DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT off, UP off). Limited. Also, enemy might move RIGHT to (4,8) and not conflict immediately.\n- DOWN to (0,6): opens more options. Can go to (0,5), (1,6), etc. Towards (0,2) apple.\n- RIGHT to (1,7): away from left edge. Good for flexibility. Can go to (1,6), (1,8), (2,7), etc.\n\nAvoiding enemy: enemy is at (3,8) and likely to move RIGHT to (4,8) for apples, or UP/DOWN. No immediate threat to me at (0,7). So all my safe moves are low risk.\n\nLong-term: I should go for the closest apple. (0,2) is 5 steps away (manhattan distance). Moving DOWN gets me closer. (4,4) is also 7 steps away.

Alternatively, if I move RIGHT to (1,7), I can then go DOWN to (1,6) and so on, but that might be longer.\n\nBut moving DOWN to (0,6) is safe and direct towards (0,2). Also, it keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nRIGHT to (1,7) is also good for flexibility, but might delay reaching the apple.\n\nUP to (0,8) is less desirable due to corner.\n\nSo DOWN is best.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move DOWN to (0,6) to head towards the apple at (0,2). Next turn, continue DOWN to (0,5) if safe. Avoid enemy by staying left and bottom. If enemy comes down, be prepared to move right. But for now, prioritize getting the apple.\n\nDOWN",

So 3 options, no apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT eats apple, grows, keeps 3 options next turn.  \nUP gives only 2 options, slightly riskier.  \nDOWN gives 3 options but no apple.  \n\nBest: **RIGHT** to eat apple and maintain flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT, I\u2019ll be at (8,8) with body (7,8),(6,8),(5,8).

Similarly, if I move RIGHT to (2,2), I can go DOWN to (2,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth are good. However, moving RIGHT to (2,2) might be slightly better because it is closer to the center and gives more options after eating the apple (e.g., going to (3,2) or (2,3)). Also, moving DOWN to (1,1) is a bit more constrained (left edge).\n\nSo prefer RIGHT.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is safe, leads to a position to get the apple next turn, and has good future options.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (4,7) at Manhattan distance |7-4| + |7-7| = 3.  \nFrom my position:  \n- DOWN to (7,6): distance to (4,7) = |7-4| + |6-7| = 3+1 = 4 \u2192 farther.  \n- LEFT to (6,7): distance to (4,7) = |6-4| + |7-7| = 2+0 = 2 \u2192 closer.  \n\nLEFT moves directly toward (4,7).

Check collisions: no snakes there. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,1) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there? But there is an apple at (2,1) - no snake body. However, note: enemy is far. So safe.\n- LEFT: (1,2) - this is my own body segment (immediately behind head). Moving backwards into your body is deadly. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - within board. Check collisions: no snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo unsafe moves: LEFT. Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apple is at (2,1) - directly below me. Moving DOWN will eat that apple immediately. This is highly beneficial as it increases my length to 3 and score to 2.\n\nOther apples are further: (4,4) is 2 steps right and 2 up, (4,5) is 2 right and 3 up, etc. But (2,1) is very close.\n\n**Enemy snake:**\nEnemy is at (7,7) and is likely moving towards apples at (4,7) or (1,9). It is far away (distance 5 in x and 5 in y), so no immediate threat.\n\n**Future moves after eating apple:**\nIf I move DOWN to (2,1) and eat the apple:\n- My snake will grow: head at (2,1), body becomes [(2,2), (1,2)].\n- Next turn, from (2,1): possible moves:\n  - UP: (2,2) - this will be my body (the current head becomes the first body segment). So deadly.\n  - DOWN: (2,0) - safe.\n  - LEFT: (1,1) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (3,1) - safe.\nSo three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nI will have to avoid moving UP into my own body. But other options exist.\n\nIf I don't eat the apple now (e.g., move UP or RIGHT), the apple might still be there next turn, but there is a risk that the enemy might eventually come (though unlikely soon). However, eating it now is efficient.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nMoving DOWN is safe and gets an apple. There is no other snake near to compete for it.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating this apple, I should move away from my own body to avoid being trapped. For example, from (2,1), I can go DOWN to (2,0) or LEFT to (1,1) or RIGHT to (3,1). Then proceed towards the cluster of apples at (4,4), (4,5), etc. to continue growing.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN is safe and immediately gets an apple. This is the best move to increase my score and length.\n\nDOWN",

No bodies. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- The closest apple is (4,4) at Manhattan distance |4-4| + |4-1| = 0+3=3.\n- Other apples: (4,5) is 0+4=4, (3,6) is 1+5=6, (1,9) is 3+8=11, (7,0) is 3+1=4.\n- Moving UP to (4,2) gets closer to (4,4) (now distance |4-4|+|4-2|=0+2=2).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,1) moves away from (4,4) (distance |5-4|+|1-4|=1+3=4).\n- Moving DOWN to (4,0) moves away from apples.\n\nSo UP is best for approaching the closest apple.\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Enemy at (4,7) is far. It might move toward (3,6) or (1,9). Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- From (4,1), moving UP to (4,2): next turn from (4,2), body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n  - UP: (4,3) - free\n  - DOWN: (4,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (3,2) - free\n  - RIGHT: (5,2) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,1): next turn from (5,1), body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n  - UP: (5,2) - free\n  - DOWN: (5,0) - free\n  - LEFT: (4,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (6,1) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n- Moving DOWN to (4,0): next turn from (4,0), body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n  - UP: (4,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - DOWN: (4,-1) - off board \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (3,0) - free\n  - RIGHT: (5,0) - free\n  So safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).\n\nThus, UP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves, while DOWN gives only 2.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead toward the apple cluster at (4,4) and (4,5).

Check for bodies: no snake bodies there (my body is at (4,1) and (3,1), enemy is at (4,6) and below). Safe.\n- **DOWN: (4, 1)** \u2014 This is my own body segment (the first segment behind head). Moving backwards into own body \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**\n- **LEFT: (3, 2)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n- **RIGHT: (5, 2)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- The closest apple is (4,4) at Manhattan distance |4-4| + |4-2| = 0+2=2.\n- Other apples: (4,5) is 0+3=3, (3,6) is 1+4=5, (1,9) is 3+7=10, (7,0) is 3+2=5.\n- Moving UP to (4,3) gets closer to (4,4) (now distance |4-4|+|4-3|=0+1=1).\n- Moving LEFT to (3,2) moves away from (4,4) (distance |3-4|+|2-4|=1+2=3) but closer to (3,6) (|3-3|+|2-6|=0+4=4).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,2) moves away from (4,4) (distance |5-4|+|2-4|=1+2=3).\n\nSo UP is best for approaching the closest apple (4,4).\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Enemy at (4,6) is close. It might move toward (3,6) or (4,5). It could also move down toward (4,5) or left/right. We should avoid moving directly toward it to prevent head-on collision.\n  - From (4,6), enemy can move UP (4,7) - its own body? (4,7) is its body \u2192 unsafe for it? Actually, enemy body is [(4,7), (5,7), ...] so (4,7) is occupied. So enemy cannot move UP.\n  - Enemy can move DOWN (4,5) - free? (4,5) has an apple, but no body. Safe for enemy.\n  - LEFT (3,6) - free (apple at (3,6)).\n  - RIGHT (5,6) - free.\n  So enemy likely moves DOWN to (4,5) to get the apple or LEFT to (3,6). Moving DOWN would put it at (4,5) which is adjacent to (4,4).\n\nIf I move UP to (4,3), next turn I could go to (4,4) to get the apple. But if enemy moves DOWN to (4,5), then (4,4) is between us. If we both move to (4,4) next turn, head-on collision \u2192 both die. So we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, moving UP now is risky because if enemy moves DOWN to (4,5), then I plan to go to (4,4) next turn, but enemy might also go to (4,4) from (4,5)? Actually, from (4,5), enemy can move DOWN to (4,4). So if I am at (4,3) and move UP to (4,4) next turn, and enemy moves DOWN to (4,4) same turn, we collide.\n\nTo avoid this, I should not rush directly to (4,4). Instead, consider moving LEFT to (3,2) to approach (3,6) or wait. But (3,6) is also a target for enemy.\n\nAlternatively, move RIGHT to (5,2) to avoid immediate conflict and approach (7,0) later.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- From (4,2), moving UP to (4,3): next turn body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]\n  - UP: (4,4) - free (apple) but risky if enemy is at (4,5)\n  - DOWN: (4,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (3,3) - free\n  - RIGHT: (5,3) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,2): next turn body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]\n  - UP: (3,3) - free\n  - DOWN: (3,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (2,2) - free\n  - RIGHT: (4,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 options).\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,2): next turn body: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]\n  - UP: (5,3) - free\n  - DOWN: (5,1) - free\n  - LEFT: (4,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (6,2) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nSo UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves, LEFT gives only 2.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAvoid head-on collision with enemy. Since enemy is likely to move DOWN to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,6), I should not move directly toward (4,4). Instead, move RIGHT to (5,2) to stay safe and approach the apple at (7,0) later. This maintains good mobility and avoids the conflict zone.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is the safest move: it avoids potential head-on collision, maintains future options (3 moves next turn), and moves toward the apple at (7,0) which is less contested.\n\nRIGHT",

Body segments: [(4, 2), (4, 1)].\n- Apples at: (4, 4), (1, 9), (7, 0), (3, 6), (2, 3).\n- Enemy snake #0 head is at (4, 5), body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)].\n- I have 2 apples (length 3), enemy has 5 apples (length 6).\n\n**Possible moves from (5, 2): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- **UP: (5, 3)** \u2014 Within board. Check for bodies: no snake bodies there (my body is at (4,2) and (4,1), enemy is at (4,5) and above). Safe.\n- **DOWN: (5, 1)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n- **LEFT: (4, 2)** \u2014 This is my own body segment (the first segment behind head). Moving backwards into own body \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**\n- **RIGHT: (6, 2)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- The closest apples are (4,4) (Manhattan |5-4|+|2-4|=1+2=3), (2,3) (|5-2|+|2-3|=3+1=4), (3,6) (|5-3|+|2-6|=2+4=6), (7,0) (|5-7|+|2-0|=2+2=4), (1,9) (|5-1|+|2-9|=4+7=11).\n- Moving UP to (5,3) gets closer to (4,4) (now distance |5-4|+|3-4|=1+1=2) and (2,3) (|5-2|+|3-3|=3+0=3).\n- Moving DOWN to (5,1) moves away from most apples except (7,0) (|5-7|+|1-0|=2+1=3) but closer to (7,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,2) gets closer to (7,0) (|6-7|+|2-0|=1+2=3) and away from others.\n\nSo UP is best for approaching (4,4) and (2,3), while RIGHT is good for (7,0).\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Enemy at (4,5) is close. It might move toward (4,4) (DOWN), (3,5) (LEFT), (5,5) (RIGHT), or (4,6) (UP) but (4,6) is its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n  - So enemy safe moves: DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5).\n  - Enemy is likely to move DOWN to (4,4) to get the apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid starvation.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,3), I am adjacent to (4,4). If enemy moves DOWN to (4,4), then next turn I could move LEFT to (4,4) and collide with enemy? Actually, if enemy is at (4,4) and I move to (4,4) from (5,3) (LEFT), that would be a head-on collision. So risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could avoid (4,4) and go for (2,3) or (7,0). Moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and approaches (7,0), which is far from enemy.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- From (5,2), moving UP to (5,3): next turn body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - UP: (5,4) - free\n  - DOWN: (5,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (4,3) - free\n  - RIGHT: (6,3) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n- Moving DOWN to (5,1): next turn body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - UP: (5,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - DOWN: (5,0) - free\n  - LEFT: (4,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (6,1) - free\n  So safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT (2 options).\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,2): next turn body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - UP: (6,3) - free\n  - DOWN: (6,1) - free\n  - LEFT: (5,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (7,2) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nSo UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves, DOWN gives only 2.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAvoid conflict with enemy at (4,5). Since enemy is likely to go for (4,4), I should not compete directly. Instead, move RIGHT to (6,2) to approach (7,0) safely. This maintains good mobility and avoids potential head-on collision.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is the safest move: it avoids the conflict zone, maintains future options (3 moves next turn), and moves toward the apple at (7,0) which is uncontested by the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Body segments: [(6, 2), (5, 2)].\n- Apples at: (1, 9), (7, 0), (3, 6), (2, 3), (8, 7).\n- Enemy snake #0 head is at (3, 4), body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)].\n- I have 2 apples (length 3), enemy has 6 apples (length 7).\n\n**Possible moves from (6, 1): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- **UP: (6, 2)** \u2014 This is my own body segment (the first segment behind head). Moving backwards into own body \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**\n- **DOWN: (6, 0)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n- **LEFT: (5, 1)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n- **RIGHT: (7, 1)** \u2014 Within board. No bodies. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- Closest apples: (7,0) (|6-7|+|1-0|=1+1=2), (2,3) (|6-2|+|1-3|=4+2=6), (3,6) (|6-3|+|1-6|=3+5=8), (8,7) (|6-8|+|1-7|=2+6=8), (1,9) (far).\n- Moving DOWN to (6,0) gets adjacent to (7,0) (next turn RIGHT would eat it).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,1) gets closer to (7,0) (|7-7|+|1-0|=0+1=1) and (8,7) (|7-8|+|1-7|=1+6=7).\n- Moving LEFT to (5,1) gets closer to (2,3) (|5-2|+|1-3|=3+2=5) but farther from (7,0).\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are best for (7,0), which is the closest apple.\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Enemy head at (3,4) is not too close. Its safe moves: from (3,4), it can go UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4) \u2014 but (4,4) is its own body? Actually (4,4) is the first body segment \u2192 unsafe. So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- Enemy might go for (2,3) via DOWN/LEFT or (3,6) via UP. (7,0) is far from enemy and uncontested.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- From (6,1), moving DOWN to (6,0): next turn body: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n  - UP: (6,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - DOWN: (6,-1) - off board \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (5,0) - free\n  - RIGHT: (7,0) - apple! (if we go RIGHT, we eat it and grow)\n  So safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT (2 options, but RIGHT eats apple).\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,1): next turn body: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n  - UP: (7,2) - free\n  - DOWN: (7,0) - apple! (eating it)\n  - LEFT: (6,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (8,1) - free\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options, DOWN eats apple).\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5,1): next turn body: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n  - UP: (5,2) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - DOWN: (5,0) - free\n  - LEFT: (4,1) - free\n  - RIGHT: (6,1) - my body \u2192 unsafe\n  So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).\n\nDOWN and RIGHT both lead to eating (7,0) next turn (with RIGHT from (6,0) or DOWN from (7,1)). However, moving DOWN now to (6,0) gives only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT and RIGHT), but RIGHT eats the apple. Moving RIGHT to (7,1) gives 3 safe moves next turn (including DOWN to eat the apple). Moving LEFT gives fewer options and doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat (7,0) next turn to grow and avoid enemy. After eating, we'll have more length and can plan for other apples. The enemy is large (length 7) so avoid confrontation.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move: it goes to (7,1), which is safe and adjacent to (7,0). Next turn we can eat it with DOWN. This gives more flexibility (3 safe moves next turn) compared to DOWN (which leads to (6,0) with only 2 safe moves). Also, RIGHT avoids any potential conflict with enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Its safe moves: from (3,5), it can go UP (3,6) (apple), DOWN (3,4) (its own body? Actually (3,4) is its first body segment \u2192 unsafe), LEFT (2,5) (free), RIGHT (4,5) (its own body? (4,5) is in its body \u2192 unsafe). So enemy safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n- Enemy will likely go UP to (3,6) to eat the apple there. It is not a threat to me currently.\n\n**Future moves after eating (7,0):**\nIf I move DOWN to (7,0) and eat the apple:\n- My new body: head at (7,0), body segments: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (grew by one, so tail remains same).\n- Next turn, from (7,0):\n  - UP: (7,1) \u2014 my body (the segment just behind head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (7,-1) \u2014 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (6,0) \u2014 free.\n  - RIGHT: (8,0) \u2014 free.\n  So safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT (2 options). This is acceptable since we just ate an apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (7,2):\n- Next turn body: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n  - UP: (7,3) free\n  - DOWN: (7,1) my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - LEFT: (6,2) my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (8,2) free\n  So only 2 safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nOr if I move RIGHT to (8,1):\n- Next turn body: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n  - UP: (8,2) free\n  - DOWN: (8,0) free\n  - LEFT: (7,1) my body \u2192 unsafe\n  - RIGHT: (9,1) free\n  So 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nBut moving DOWN eats the apple now, which is immediate gain. The enemy has 6 apples, so I need to catch up.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat (7,0) now to grow to length 4. Then from (7,0), I can go LEFT to (6,0) or RIGHT to (8,0). After that, consider targeting (8,7) or (2,3). Avoid the enemy since it is larger.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN is the best move: it eats the apple at (7,0) immediately, growing me and scoring a point. This is safe and beneficial.

Body segments: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (I grew by one from eating the apple at (7,0), so now length 4).\n- Apples at: (1,9), (3,6), (2,3), (8,7), (8,1) (note: (7,0) is gone).\n- Enemy snake #0 head is at (2,5), body: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)] (length 7).\n- I have 3 apples, enemy has 6.\n\n**Possible moves from (7,0): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- **UP: (7,1)** \u2014 This is my own body segment (the first segment behind head). Moving backwards into own body \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**\n- **DOWN: (7,-1)** \u2014 Off the board (y=-1). **Unsafe.**\n- **LEFT: (6,0)** \u2014 Within board. Check board: at (6,0) is '.' (free). Safe.\n- **RIGHT: (8,0)** \u2014 Within board. Check board: at (8,0) is '.' (free). Safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Apples:**\n- Closest apple is (8,1) (distance |7-8| + |0-1| = 1+1=2). Also (8,7) is farther.\n- (8,1) is directly above and to the right: if I go RIGHT to (8,0), then next turn I can go UP to (8,1) to eat it.\n- Alternatively, if I go LEFT to (6,0), I am moving away from (8,1) and other apples.\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Enemy head at (2,5) is far. Its safe moves: from (2,5), it can go UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) (which is its own body). So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- Enemy might go towards (3,6) (apple) or (2,3) (apple). Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Future moves:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0):\n- Next turn head at (8,0), body: [(7,0), (7,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n- From (8,0):\n  - UP: (8,1) \u2014 apple! Eating it would grow me.\n  - DOWN: (8,-1) \u2014 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (7,0) \u2014 my body (the segment behind head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - RIGHT: (9,0) \u2014 free.\n  So safe moves: UP and RIGHT. UP eats the apple at (8,1).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0):\n- Next turn head at (6,0), body: [(7,0), (7,1), (6,1), (6,2)].\n- From (6,0):\n  - UP: (6,1) \u2014 my body (the segment behind head) \u2192 unsafe.\n  - DOWN: (6,-1) \u2014 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (5,0) \u2014 free.\n  - RIGHT: (7,0) \u2014 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n  So only safe move: LEFT to (5,0). This is very limiting and doesn't lead to an apple soon.\n\nGoing RIGHT sets me up to eat (8,1) next turn, which is beneficial. Going LEFT leaves me with only one safe move and no immediate apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (8,1), I'll be at (8,1) with length 5. Then I can consider moving towards (8,7) or other apples. Avoid the enemy.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is the better move: it leads to a position where I can eat an apple next turn and has more options afterward. LEFT is safe but leads to a dead-end with no apple in sight.\n\nRIGHT",

So 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) plus possibly RIGHT if apple still there and no enemy.  \n- DOWN to (2,4): next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5) my body, DOWN (2,3) apple (safe if no enemy), LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) my body. So 2 safe moves (DOWN to apple, LEFT).  \n- LEFT to (1,5): next turn from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) empty, LEFT (0,5) empty, RIGHT (2,5) my body.

Apple (8,1) is closer to enemy, but not a threat to me.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nI have a lead (6 apples vs 3).  \nGoing DOWN directly toward apple (2,3) is tempting, but after eating it, my head will be at (2,3) with limited exits (UP back into body, LEFT (1,3) empty, RIGHT (3,3) empty, DOWN (2,2) empty) \u2014 actually 3 exits, not bad.  \nGoing LEFT keeps more options open and still allows DOWN next turn toward apple (2,3).  \nGoing UP moves away from nearest apple but maybe toward (3,6) later.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBest to stay flexible while progressing toward nearest apple.  \nLEFT to (1,5) gives most safe moves next turn and keeps path to (2,3) open (from (1,5), next turn DOWN to (1,4), then DOWN to (1,3), then RIGHT to (2,3) \u2014 longer but safe).  \nAlternatively, DOWN now gets apple in 2 turns with fewer options after eating.  \nGiven my lead, I prefer safety and flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,5), consider moving DOWN toward apple (2,3) area, but check enemy movement first. Keep an eye on apple (3,6) \u2014 if enemy moves toward it, maybe go UP/right later.\n\nLEFT",

Its safe moves: from (1,4), it can go UP (1,5) (its own body? Actually (1,5) is its body segment \u2192 unsafe), DOWN (1,3) (free), LEFT (0,4) (free), RIGHT (2,4) (free). So safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Enemy might go towards (2,3) (DOWN/RIGHT) or (3,6) (RIGHT/UP) or (1,9) (UP, but blocked by its body). Not an immediate threat to me.\n\n**Future moves:**\nIf I go UP to (8,2):\n- Head at (8,2), body: [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (7,1), (6,1)].\n- From (8,2):\n  - UP: (8,3) \u2014 free.\n  - DOWN: (8,1) \u2014 my body \u2192 unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (7,2) \u2014 free.\n  - RIGHT: (9,2) \u2014 free.\n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Going RIGHT only gives two safe moves (UP, DOWN) and doesn't progress towards an apple as directly.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove upwards to collect (8,7). Then consider going left to (3,6) or (2,3) if still available. Avoid the enemy (which is longer and more dangerous). Keep an eye on enemy movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Final decision:**\nUP is the best move: it is safe, moves towards an apple, and keeps more options open for next turn.\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN gets me closer to (3,0).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (8,3):**  \nEnemy safe moves: UP (8,4) empty, DOWN (8,2) its body \u2192 illegal, LEFT (7,3) empty, RIGHT (9,3) empty.  \nEnemy is far (Manhattan distance 6 from my head), no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n- UP to (2,4): next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5) my body, DOWN (2,3) my body, LEFT (1,4) my body, RIGHT (3,4) my body \u2192 all 4 moves blocked! That\u2019s a trap. So UP is safe this turn but kills me next turn unless I can eat an apple to grow and open a new path \u2014 but no apple at (2,4). So UP is very dangerous.  \n- DOWN to (2,2): next turn from (2,2): UP (2,3) my body, DOWN (2,1) empty, LEFT (1,2) empty, RIGHT (3,2) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 actually 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Yes, UP is blocked by my body at (2,3).  \n- RIGHT to (3,3): next turn from (3,3): UP (3,4) my body, DOWN (3,2) empty, LEFT (2,3) my body, RIGHT (4,3) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nSo DOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives 2, UP gives 0.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple access after each safe move:**  \nDOWN: closer to apple (3,0) (distance 2 after moving).  \nRIGHT: closer to apple (3,6) (distance 3 after moving).  \nUP: would be closer to (3,6) but dead next turn, so not viable.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of enemy:**  \nEnemy is far, not an immediate threat. I have a lead (7 apples vs 4).  \nI should avoid moves that trap me. UP is clearly suicidal next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN is safest (most future options) and moves toward apple (3,0).  \nRIGHT reduces future options but moves toward (3,6).  \nGiven my lead, safety first: choose DOWN.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,2), consider moving toward (3,0) or keeping space open. Avoid boxing myself in.  \n\nDOWN",

Tail moves from (3, 4) to (3, 5)? Actually, tail is at (3, 4) now, but after moving without eating, the last segment (tail) is removed and a new segment added at head, so the body shifts:  \nNew body: head (2, 1), then old head (2, 2) becomes segment 2, then (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5) \u2014 yes, tail at (3, 5).

Not an immediate risk.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Apple path after move:**  \nDOWN (2, 1) \u2192 then can go RIGHT (3, 1) then DOWN (3, 0) to eat apple in 2 moves.  \nRIGHT (3, 2) \u2192 then DOWN (3, 1) then DOWN (3, 0) to eat apple in 2 moves as well.  \nBoth equally efficient toward (3, 0).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Avoid boxing myself later:**  \nLEFT gives fewer future options (2 moves next turn).  \nDOWN and RIGHT both give 3 future options.  \n\nBut check board edges:  \nDOWN to (2, 1) is near bottom edge (y=0), but still fine.  \nRIGHT to (3, 2) is more central.  \n\nGiven my lead (7 vs 4 apples), safety first.

Its safe moves: from (3,2), it can go UP (3,3) (free), DOWN (3,1) (free), LEFT (2,2) (its own body \u2192 unsafe), RIGHT (4,2) (free). So safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- Enemy might go UP to (3,3) towards (3,6) apple, or DOWN to (3,1) towards (3,0) apple, or RIGHT to (4,2).

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after the last move:\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 1) head is now at (8,7) (after moving UP last turn). I ate the apple at (8,7), so my length is now 6. Body segments: [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)].\n- Apples remaining: (1,9), (3,6), (2,8), (3,0), (6,6) \u2014 note: (8,7) was eaten last turn.\n- Enemy snake #0 head is at (4,1) (it moved RIGHT last turn? But last turn it was at (3,1) and likely moved DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple? Actually, the board shows enemy head at (4,1) now. So it moved RIGHT to (4,1) instead of DOWN to (3,0)? Wait, the board state shows:\n  - At (3,0): 'A' (apple) still present? But enemy head is at (4,1). So enemy did not eat (3,0) last turn? Actually, the board state is after all moves, so enemy must have moved to (4,1) (RIGHT) and did not eat the apple at (3,0). Why? Possibly because (3,0) was not safe? But last turn we thought DOWN was safe for enemy. However, enemy chose RIGHT to (4,1) instead.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:**\n- Head at (4,1), body: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] (length 8).\n- It did not eat the apple at (3,0) last turn? So it has 7 apples still? But scores say \"Snake #0 apples: 7\" \u2014 same as last turn. So it did not grow.\n\n**Possible moves from my head (8,7):**\n- UP: (8,8) \u2014 Check board: free ('.'). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,6) \u2014 This is my own body (first segment). Moving backwards \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**\n- LEFT: (7,7) \u2014 Free ('.'). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) \u2014 Within board? (9,7) is valid. Free ('.'). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 moves from (4,1):**\n- UP: (4,2) \u2014 free ('.').\n- DOWN: (4,0) \u2014 free ('.').\n- LEFT: (3,1) \u2014 its own body (first segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (5,1) \u2014 free ('.').\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Enemy is at (4,1), far from me (8,7). No immediate threat of head-on collision.\n- I should target nearby apples: (2,8) and (1,9) are above and left. Also (3,6) and (6,6) are below.\n- Moving UP to (8,8) gets me closer to (2,8) and (1,9). Also, from (8,8), I can go LEFT or UP next.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,7) also moves towards the apples on the left.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,7) moves away from the apples and towards the edge, reducing flexibility.\n\n**Future flexibility:**\n- UP to (8,8): next moves: UP (8,9), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8) \u2014 all should be free (assuming no enemy interference). Good.\n- LEFT to (7,7): next moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6) [my body? Actually (7,6) is free? Board shows '.' at (7,6)], LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) [my body? (8,7) is now my head? Actually after move, my head leaves (8,7), so (8,7) becomes body? But next turn, (8,7) will be my body segment. So moving RIGHT from (7,7) to (8,7) would be unsafe next turn. So only UP, DOWN, LEFT safe next turn from (7,7). Still decent.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): next moves: UP (9,8), DOWN (9,6) [free], LEFT (8,7) [my body unsafe], RIGHT off board unsafe. So only UP and DOWN safe \u2014 less flexible.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nThe enemy has 7 apples (same as last turn) and is on the left side. I have 6 apples. I need to collect apples quickly to catch up. The apples at (2,8) and (1,9) are high-value targets. Also (3,6) and (6,6) are available. I should move towards the left to get (2,8) and (1,9). Avoid the enemy which is at (4,1) and likely moving downwards or right.\n\n**Best move:**\nUP to (8,8) is good to get closer to the top-left apples. It also maintains good flexibility for future moves.\n\nLEFT to (7,7) is also good, but UP is slightly better because it positions me directly towards (2,8) and (1,9).\n\nRIGHT is worse as it moves away.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\nUP",

No immediate threat of head-on collision.\n- Apples at (2,8) and (1,9) are close to me (top-left). Also (3,6) and (6,6) are below.\n- Moving UP to (8,9) gets me closer to (1,9) and (2,8). From (8,9), I can go LEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8) (but that would be backwards next turn) or RIGHT to (9,9). However, (8,8) will be my body next turn, so DOWN from (8,9) would be unsafe. So only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn from (8,9).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,8) is good to approach the apples. From (7,8), next moves: UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7) [free], LEFT (6,8) [free], RIGHT (8,8) [my body unsafe]. So three safe moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,8) is less flexible: next moves: UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7) [free], LEFT (8,8) [my body unsafe], RIGHT off board. So only two safe moves.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI need to catch up to enemy's 7 apples. The closest apples are (2,8) and (1,9). I should move towards them. UP and LEFT both help, but UP to (8,9) is directly towards (1,9). However, moving LEFT to (7,8) is also good and gives more flexibility for next moves.\n\nConsider: from (7,8), I can go UP to (7,9) and then LEFT to (6,9), etc., to reach (1,9). Or go LEFT to (6,8) and then UP to (6,9), etc. This path avoids getting trapped at the top edge.\n\nUP to (8,9) is riskier because it reduces my safe moves next turn to only two (LEFT and RIGHT). But it is closer to the apple.\n\nLEFT to (7,8) is safer with three safe moves next turn and still progresses towards the apples.\n\nRIGHT is worse as it moves away.\n\nSo I prefer LEFT for better flexibility and safety.\n\n**Final decision:**\nLEFT to (7,8) is the best move to safely approach the apples while maintaining options.\n\nLEFT",

It can move UP to (8, 9) (empty), DOWN to (8, 7) (its body), LEFT to (7, 8), RIGHT to (9, 8).  \nNo immediate collision risk with me this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (5, 1), Manhattan distances to apples:  \n- (3, 0): dist = 3  \n- (3, 6): dist = 5  \n- (6, 6): dist = 6  \n- (2, 8): dist = 10  \n- (1, 9): dist = 12  \n\nClosest is (3, 0) at distance 3.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Which safe move gets me closer to (3, 0)?**  \n- DOWN to (5, 0): distance to (3, 0) = 2.  \n- UP to (5, 2): distance to (3, 0) = 4.  \n- RIGHT to (6, 1): distance to (3, 0) = 4.  \n\nDOWN is best for approaching (3, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (5, 0)** \u2013 no apple eaten.  \nNew body: head (5, 0), then (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3) tail.  \nFrom (5, 0) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 1): my body \u2192 blocked.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 0): empty.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). LEFT leads toward (3, 0).  \n\n2. **UP to (5, 2)** \u2013 no apple eaten.  \nNew body: head (5, 2), then (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3) tail.  \nFrom (5, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 1): my body \u2192 blocked.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (6, 1)** \u2013 no apple eaten.  \nNew body: head (6, 1), then (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3) tail.  \nFrom (6, 1) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 1): my body \u2192 blocked.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 1): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nI have a lead (7 vs 5 apples). Survival is key.  \nDOWN gets me closer to (3, 0) but reduces future moves to 2.  \nUP and RIGHT keep 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \n- UP moves away from (3, 0) but opens path toward (3, 6) later.  \n- RIGHT moves slightly away from (3, 0) but keeps (6, 6) in range later.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (8, 8), likely going for (2, 8) or (1, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI want to stay flexible and avoid dead ends.  \nDOWN is tempting for the apple, but being stuck with only 2 moves next turn is risky if enemy approaches.  \nUP gives more space to maneuver in the center.  \n\nActually, from (5, 2), I can go LEFT to (4, 2) next turn, then DOWN toward (3, 0) if safe.  \nThat\u2019s a safer route than going DOWN now into a corner.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove UP now to maintain flexibility and stay away from the bottom edge. Next turn from (5, 2), consider moving LEFT toward (4, 2) and eventually toward (3, 0) or (3, 6) while monitoring enemy movement.  \n\nUP",

From (7,7), next moves: UP (7,8) [my body unsafe], DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). So three safe moves.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI need to catch up to enemy's 7 apples. The closest apples are (2,8) and (1,9). I should prioritize moving towards them. UP and LEFT both help, but LEFT to (6,8) is directly towards (2,8) and gives more flexibility for next moves (three options vs two for UP). DOWN moves away and is less efficient.\n\nLEFT is the best move to efficiently approach the apples while maintaining good options.\n\n**Final decision:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

The closest apples are (2,8) and (1,9). Moving LEFT to (5,8) is the most direct path towards (2,8) and gives good flexibility (three next moves). UP to (6,9) is also good but slightly less direct. DOWN moves away and is less efficient.\n\nLEFT is the best move to efficiently approach the apples while maintaining good options.\n\n**Final decision:**\nLEFT",

No immediate threat.\n- Apples at (1,9), (2,8), and (3,6) are relevant. (2,8) is directly to my left (x=2, y=8) from (4,8): so moving LEFT to (3,8) gets me closer. From (3,8), I can then go LEFT again to (2,8) to eat the apple.\n- Moving UP to (4,9) gets me closer to (1,9) but requires two more moves (LEFT then UP or LEFT twice? Actually from (4,9), I can go LEFT to (3,9) and then LEFT to (2,9) and then DOWN to (2,8)? Not efficient.\n- Moving DOWN to (4,7) moves away from the closest apples (2,8) and (1,9), but towards (3,6) and (6,6). However, (3,6) is at y=6, so DOWN to (4,7) is a step in that direction.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI need to catch up to enemy's 7 apples. The closest apple is (2,8) at just two moves away (LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8)). This is efficient and safe. After eating (2,8), I can plan to go DOWN towards (3,6) or (6,6). Moving LEFT now is optimal for immediate apple collection.\n\nAlso, note that enemy is far away and not a threat. My path to (2,8) is clear.\n\n**Final decision:**\nLEFT\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (3,8), next turn I will move LEFT to (2,8) to eat the apple. Then I can consider going DOWN to (2,7) to avoid trapping myself and head towards other apples. Alternatively, if enemy approaches, I might need to avoid. But currently enemy is far.\n\nLEFT",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apples to me are (1,9) and (1,5). Also (3,6) is below.\n- Moving UP to (2,9) gets me closer to (1,9) (then LEFT to (1,9)).\n- Moving LEFT to (1,8) is also a step towards (1,9) and (1,5).\n- Moving DOWN to (2,7) moves towards (3,6) and (6,2), but note enemy might be heading towards (6,2) as well.\n\n**Immediate opportunity:**\n(1,9) is very close: from (2,8), going LEFT then UP would get it. But I can also go UP then LEFT? Actually, from (2,8), UP to (2,9) then LEFT to (1,9) is safe. Alternatively, LEFT to (1,8) then UP to (1,9). Both sequences are valid.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the enemy: it might go for (6,2) or (3,6). Since enemy has more apples (8 vs my 6), I need to catch up.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter this move, I should aim for (1,9) next. Then I can go DOWN to (1,8) and further to (1,5) or towards (3,6). Avoiding the enemy is important: enemy is at (6,6) and might move towards (3,6) or (6,2). I should not directly confront it.\n\n**Which move now?**\nAll moves are safe. UP to (2,9) is good because it gets me closer to (1,9). LEFT to (1,8) also gets me closer. DOWN to (2,7) is safe but moves away from the closest apple (1,9).\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, UP is slightly better because it directly moves towards the apple (1,9) (which is at y=9). From (2,9), I can go LEFT to (1,9) to eat it. If I go LEFT first to (1,8), then I need to go UP to (1,9) to eat.\n\nBoth sequences are equivalent in steps. However, going UP first might be safer because it keeps me away from the enemy's potential path? Enemy is at (6,6) and moving away.\n\nAlso, note that after eating (1,9), I will grow. Then I can go DOWN to (1,8) and then further to (1,7) etc., to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Final decision:**\nUP is the best move to efficiently reach (1,9).\n\nUP\n\n**Next turn plan:**\nFrom (2,9), plan to go LEFT to (1,9) to eat the apple. Then consider going DOWN to (1,8) to avoid dead-end and head towards (1,5) or (3,6). Watch out for enemy #0 which might be going for (3,6) or (6,2). Avoid direct confrontation.\nUP",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple to me is (1,9) at adjacent LEFT. Eating it would give me 7 apples (vs enemy 8).\n- Another apple is (1,5) below, and (3,6) to the right/down.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,9) directly eats the apple.

Then I can consider next moves: from (1,9), I can go DOWN to (1,8) (which is currently my body segment, but after growth it will be safe? Actually, after eating, the body doesn't move immediately: the head moves to (1,9) and the body follows, so (1,8) becomes the new second segment. So DOWN to (1,8) would be safe next turn (since it's my own body but not backwards? Actually, from (1,9), DOWN to (1,8) is not backwards because the body segment behind is (2,9) (previous head).

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after the last move (LEFT to (1,9)) which ate the apple at (1,9). Now my head is at (1,9) and I have grown by one segment. The body now includes the previous head (2,9) as the first segment, and the tail remains at (7,8) for now (since growth happens at the head, the tail doesn't move this turn).\n\n**Current state:**\n- My head: (1,9)\n- My body: [(2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)] (length 7 segments? Actually, I had 6 segments before and ate an apple, so now I have 7 segments. The body list should be 7 long: the head (1,9) and then the previous body with the tail unchanged? Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, the head moves to the apple cell and the body follows without moving the tail. So the body becomes [new head] + [old head] + [old body without tail?]. But in our representation, the entire body is listed including the head. So after eating, the head is at (1,9), and the previous head (2,9) becomes the next segment, and so on, with the tail (7,8) still there. So my body is now: [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)]? Wait, that would be 8 segments? But I started with 6 segments and ate one apple, so I should have 7 segments. Actually, initially I had 6 segments (head + 5 body parts) and collected 7 apples? Wait, the initial state said \"Apples collected: 7\", which means I had 7 apples before this turn? And I just ate one, so now I have 8 apples and 8 segments? Let me check the initial state:\n\nIn the previous turn, my snake had apples: 7 and body length 7 segments (head + 6 body parts). Then I moved LEFT to (1,9) and ate an apple. So now I have apples: 8 and body length 8 segments. So my body should be: head at (1,9), then the previous head (2,9), then (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So 8 segments.\n\nBut in the board state, it shows \"1\" at (1,9) for my head, and \"T\" for my body segments. The board state is updated after the move? Actually, the board state shown is the state before the move? Wait, the board state is given at the beginning of the turn, so it is the state before my last move. So after my move LEFT to (1,9), the board has changed.\n\nNow, for this turn (turn 36), the board state is as given? Actually, the board state printed is for the current turn? The text says \"Turn: 36 / 150\", and then the board state. So this board state is after my move? Or before? Typically, the board state is the state at the start of the turn. But in this case, it shows my head at (1,9) and the body segments? Let's look:\n\nThe board state:\n 9 . 1 T . . . . . . .\n 8 . . T T T T T T A .\n ...\n\nSo at (1,9) it shows '1' (my head), and at (2,9) it shows 'T' (my body), and so on. So this board state is after my move. So my body is correctly represented.\n\nSo my head is at (1,9), and my body segments are at (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So 8 segments in total.\n\n**Apples:** (3,6), (3,0), (1,5), (6,2), (8,8)  [the apple at (1,9) is gone]\n\n**Enemy snake #0:** head at (4,6), body: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)], apples: 8.\n\n**Possible moves from my head (1,9):**\n- UP: (1,10) -> out of bounds (y max 9) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,8) -> currently, the board shows '.' at (1,8)? Wait, in the board state, row 8: \"8 . . T T T T T T A .\" so at x=1, y=8, it is '.' (free). But is it safe? After I move, my body will shift: the head moves to (1,9), and the body follows. So (1,8) will become a body segment only after the next move? Actually, when we consider moves, we look at the current board state. Currently, (1,8) is free. But if I move DOWN to (1,8), it will become my new head, and then my body will include (1,9) as the next segment. So it is safe because it is not currently occupied by any body (mine or enemy). However, we must check for backwards move: my current body behind my head is at (2,9). Moving DOWN to (1,8) is not backwards (backwards would be to (2,9), which is LEFT? Actually, backwards is the cell that was behind the head before moving. My head was at (1,9) and the cell behind is (2,9) (the previous head). So moving to (1,8) is not backwards. So DOWN is safe.\n- LEFT: (0,9) -> free ('.') and safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,9) -> my own body (the first segment) -> unsafe (would hit myself).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 moves from (4,6):**\n- UP: (4,7) -> free ('.')\n- DOWN: (4,5) -> free ('.')\n- LEFT: (3,6) -> free ('.') and there is an apple? Actually, (3,6) has an apple 'A'. So it might move there to eat.\n- RIGHT: (5,6) -> its own body (first segment) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Enemy is at (4,6), which is 3 cells away horizontally (dx=3) and 3 vertically (dy=3). No immediate threat.\n- The closest apples to me are (1,5) and (3,6). (1,5) is directly below me at (1,5) (4 cells down). (3,6) is to the right/down.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,8) gets me closer to (1,5).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,9) moves to the edge, which might limit future moves.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- DOWN to (1,8): This moves towards the apple at (1,5). From (1,8), I can continue DOWN to (1,7), (1,6), etc. This is a good path.\n- LEFT to (0,9): This moves to the left edge. From (0,9), I can only go DOWN (since UP is out, RIGHT is my body, LEFT is out). So it would force me down. But it is safe.\n\nDOWN is better because it directly progresses towards the apple at (1,5) and keeps more options open (from (1,8), I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT? Actually, from (1,8), LEFT is (0,8) (free), DOWN is (1,7) (free), RIGHT is (2,8) (my body, unsafe). So from (1,8), safe moves would be DOWN and LEFT. So still good.\n\nLEFT to (0,9) would lead to fewer options: from (0,9), only DOWN is safe (to (0,8)).\n\nSo DOWN is preferred.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1,8), then continue DOWN to (1,7), (1,6), (1,5) to eat the apple. After that, consider going to (3,0) or (3,6). Avoid the enemy which might be heading to (3,6). Also, note the apple at (8,8) is far, but might be useful later.\n\nDOWN",

Actually, the board shows my head at (1,8) now, and the apple at (1,9) is gone. So I have grown to 8 segments and now have 8 apples? But the score says \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 7\". This might be a discrepancy. However, the board state is clear: my head is at (1,8) and body segments follow.)\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n 9 . T T . . . . . . .\n 8 . 1 T T T T T . A .\n\nSo at (1,8) is '1' (my head), and at (1,9) is 'T' (my body). So I moved DOWN to (1,8) last turn? But the last move was DOWN? And the rationale ended with DOWN. So indeed, I moved DOWN to (1,8). And since (1,8) was free (no apple), I did not eat an apple. So my apple count remains 7. And my body length is still 8? Actually, when you don't eat an apple, the head moves and the tail moves too. So my body should have the same length. Previously I had 8 segments (after eating at (1,9)), and now after moving without eating, I should still have 8 segments. The body list is given as [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)] which is 7 segments? But that doesn't include the head. Actually, the representation says \"Body: [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)]\". This is the list without the head? Or including? The text says: \"Body: [(1,9), (2,9), ...]\" and the head is separately at (1,8). So the full body is head (1,8) + the list given (7 segments) = 8 segments. Correct.\n\nSo I have 8 segments and 7 apples (since I didn't eat this turn).\n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (1,5), (6,2), (8,8), (6,1) [note: (6,1) is new? Previously it was (6,2) and (6,1)? Actually, the list says (6,2) and (6,1) both? Wait, the apples are: (3,0), (1,5), (6,2), (8,8), (6,1). So two apples near (6,2) and (6,1).\n\n**Enemy snake #0:** head at (3,6), body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)], apples: 9.\n\n**Possible moves from my head (1,8):**\n- UP: (1,9) -> my own body (first segment) -> unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) -> free ('.') and safe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) -> free ('.') and safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) -> my own body (third segment) -> unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 moves from (3,6):**\n- UP: (3,7) -> free ('.')\n- DOWN: (3,5) -> free ('.')\n- LEFT: (2,6) -> free ('.')\n- RIGHT: (4,6) -> its own body (first segment) -> unsafe.\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Enemy is at (3,6), which is 2 cells away horizontally (dx=2) and 2 vertically (dy=2). No immediate threat.\n- The closest apples to me are (1,5) (3 cells down) and (3,0) (3 left and 5 down). Also (6,1) and (6,2) are to the right/down.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,7) gets me closer to (1,5).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,8) moves to the edge, which might limit future moves.\n\n**Which move is better?**\n- DOWN to (1,7): This moves towards the apple at (1,5). From (1,7), I can go DOWN to (1,6) (free), LEFT to (0,7) (free), or RIGHT to (2,7) (free). So multiple options.\n- LEFT to (0,8): This moves to the left edge. From (0,8), I can go DOWN to (0,7) (free) or RIGHT to (1,8) (my body, unsafe). So only DOWN is safe. This is restrictive.\n\nDOWN is better because it progresses towards the apple and keeps more options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1,7), then to (1,6), and then to (1,5) to eat the apple. After that, consider going to (3,0) or towards the apples at (6,1)/(6,2). Avoid the enemy which might be heading to the same area.

Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 9): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 8): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n\nEnemy can move DOWN or LEFT.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (1, 7), still 4 cells away from me. If enemy moves LEFT to (0, 8), far. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (3, 0), (1, 5), (6, 2), (8, 8), (6, 1).  \nFrom (3, 6):  \n- (1, 5) is dist 3 (Manhattan: |3-1|+|6-5|=3).  \n- (6, 2) is dist 7.  \n- (8, 8) is dist 11.  \n- (3, 0) is dist 6.  \n- (6, 1) is dist 8.  \n\nClosest is (1, 5).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Path to (1, 5):**  \nFrom (3, 6), moving LEFT to (2, 6) then DOWN to (2, 5) then LEFT to (1, 5) is a clear path.  \nCheck immediate move: LEFT to (2, 6) is safe.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after LEFT:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 6):  \nNext turn from (2, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (2, 7): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 5): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 6): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 6): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn. Good.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative moves:**  \nUP to (3, 7): next turn options: UP (3, 8) empty, DOWN (3, 6) my body illegal, LEFT (2, 7) empty, RIGHT (4, 7) empty \u2192 3 moves, but moves away from closest apple.  \nDOWN to (3, 5): next turn options: UP (3, 6) my body illegal, DOWN (3, 4) empty, LEFT (2, 5) empty, RIGHT (4, 5) empty \u2192 3 moves, closer to (1, 5) than UP but not as direct as LEFT.  \n\nLEFT is most direct toward (1, 5) while keeping future options open.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy future threat:**  \nEnemy might move toward (1, 5) too, but currently at (1, 8), it could go DOWN to (1, 7) then (1, 6) then (1, 5) in 3 turns. I can reach (1, 5) in 3 turns if I go LEFT now. We might race for it, but I'm closer in Manhattan distance (3 vs enemy's 3 as well, but enemy's path may be blocked by its body).  \n\nActually, enemy body: (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8). So from (1, 8), enemy can't go RIGHT (body at (2, 8)), can't go UP (body at (1, 9)), so only DOWN or LEFT. If enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7), then next turn from (1, 7) it can go DOWN to (1, 6), then DOWN to (1, 5) in 3 turns. Same as my 3 turns if I go LEFT now. Could be a tie or head-on collision risk at (1, 5) on turn 40 if we both aim there.  \n\nMaybe better to go DOWN to (3, 5) this turn, then LEFT to (2, 5), then LEFT to (1, 5) \u2014 also 3 turns, but different path, might avoid racing directly? Actually, if enemy goes (1, 8)\u2192(1, 7)\u2192(1, 6)\u2192(1, 5), and I go (3, 6)\u2192(3, 5)\u2192(2, 5)\u2192(1, 5), we both arrive at (1, 5) on turn 40, but from different directions, so no head-on collision (I'd be moving LEFT into (1, 5), enemy moving DOWN into (1, 5) \u2014 simultaneous entry into same cell = both die). That's bad.  \n\nSo maybe avoid (1, 5) entirely for now? But it's the closest apple.  \n\nLet's check other apples: (3, 0) is far, (6, 2) is near my tail area. My tail is at (5, 1). (6, 2) is close to tail, safe to go there after tail moves.  \n\nActually, my body: head (3, 6), then (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 5), then next turn go DOWN to (3, 4), then RIGHT to (4, 4), then RIGHT to (5, 4), then DOWN to (5, 3) \u2014 but (5, 3) is my body now, but in 4 turns tail will have moved.  \n\nBetter to go toward (6, 2) or (6, 1) after tail clears.  \n\nGiven enemy might race for (1, 5) and cause mutual death, I'll avoid that risk now.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose safest high-option move:**  \nLEFT to (2, 6) is safe, gives 3 next moves, and doesn't commit to (1, 5) immediately \u2014 from (2, 6) I can go DOWN to (2, 5) next turn and reassess enemy position. If enemy is moving toward (1, 5), I can divert to another apple.  \n\nUP to (3, 7) is safe but away from all apples.  \nDOWN to (3, 5) is safe and moves toward (6, 2) area after tail moves.  \n\nActually, DOWN might be better: from (3, 5), next turn I can go LEFT to (2, 5) or DOWN to (3, 4), both safe, moving toward bottom-left apples (3, 0) or (1, 5) with option to change path.  \n\nGiven enemy path to (1, 5) is clear and risky, I'll go DOWN to (3, 5) to move toward bottom apples and keep space.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 5), assess enemy head position. If enemy is at (1, 7) or (1, 6), avoid (1, 5). Consider path to (3, 0) via (3, 4), (3, 3), etc., or (6, 2) after tail moves. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (1,5) - 2 cells down from me. Also (3,0) is 3 left and 5 down, and (6,1)/(6,2) are to the right/down.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,6) gets me closer to (1,5).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,7) moves to the edge, which might limit future moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,7) is safe and opens more options.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- DOWN to (1,6): This directly progresses towards the apple at (1,5). From (1,6), I can go DOWN to (1,5) (apple), LEFT to (0,6) (free), or RIGHT to (2,6) (free). This is efficient.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Moves to edge. From (0,7), only DOWN (0,6) is safe (RIGHT is my body). Restrictive.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Moves away from the apple at (1,5) but towards the apples at (6,1)/(6,2). From (2,7), I can go DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7) (my body, unsafe), or RIGHT (3,7). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. This is less efficient for getting (1,5).\n\nDOWN is the best because it minimizes the path to the nearest apple and maintains good options (after (1,6), I have two safe moves: DOWN to apple or LEFT/RIGHT).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1,6) this turn, then DOWN to (1,5) to eat the apple next turn. After that, consider going to (3,0) (left/down) or towards (6,1)/(6,2) (right/down). Avoid the enemy which might be moving towards the same apples. Also note the apple at (8,8) is far but may be useful later. Keep an eye on enemy #0's movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 8): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 6): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 7): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7): empty.  \n\nEnemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 7), it\u2019s 2 cells away from my head (3, 5). If enemy moves DOWN to (1, 6), it\u2019s 3 cells away. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (3, 0), (1, 5), (6, 2), (8, 8), (6, 1).  \nFrom (3, 5):  \n- (1, 5) dist 2  \n- (3, 0) dist 5  \n- (6, 2) dist 6  \n- (6, 1) dist 7  \n- (8, 8) dist 13  \n\nClosest is (1, 5).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Path to (1, 5) and enemy race risk:**  \nEnemy at (1, 7) can go DOWN to (1, 6) next turn, then DOWN to (1, 5) in 2 turns.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (2, 5), then LEFT to (1, 5) next turn, I reach (1, 5) in 2 turns as well. That means both heads would enter (1, 5) on turn 40 \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nSo going LEFT now risks mutual death if enemy also moves toward (1, 5).  \nEnemy might not go for it immediately, but it\u2019s a clear risk.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Alternative moves:**  \n- DOWN to (3, 4): moves toward (3, 0) and away from enemy. From there, next turn options: DOWN (3, 3), LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4) \u2014 all likely safe.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 5): moves toward center, closer to apples (6, 2) and (6, 1) after tail moves. Tail is at (5, 2), will move next turn as I didn\u2019t eat apple last turn. From (4, 5), next turn options: UP (4, 6) my body? Wait, my body: (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2). So (4, 6) is my body now, but after tail moves, (4, 6) remains occupied until I move further. So UP from (4, 5) next turn is unsafe. DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) empty (old head vacated), RIGHT (5, 5) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn if RIGHT now.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety and tail movement:**  \nMy tail will move from (5, 2) next turn, freeing (5, 2). That makes (6, 2) apple safer to approach soon.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 5) now, next turn I can go RIGHT to (5, 5), then DOWN to (5, 4), then LEFT to (4, 4) etc., circling toward (6, 2) after tail clears path.  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 4), I can go down column 3 toward (3, 0), but enemy might cut me off later.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (1, 6) to chase (1, 5) apple. If I avoid (1, 5), I reduce collision risk.  \nGoing RIGHT keeps me farther from enemy and opens path to bottom-right apples.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose move:**  \nLEFT risks head-on collision for (1, 5).  \nDOWN is safe but moves into more open area but away from most apples except (3, 0).  \nRIGHT moves toward center and future apples (6, 2)/(6, 1) with good future options.\n\nRIGHT seems best: avoids enemy race, keeps multiple next moves, aligns with tail movement freeing space near (6, 2).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 5), assess enemy position. If enemy moved toward (1, 5), consider path to (6, 2) via (5, 5) \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (6, 2) after tail clears. Avoid getting boxed in by own body.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (1,5) directly below me. Eating it now is highly advantageous.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,5) eats the apple and grows. This is the most direct path.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,6) moves to the edge, which might limit future moves (only DOWN to (0,5) or RIGHT to (1,6) but that is my body next turn? Actually after LEFT, from (0,6) I can go DOWN (0,5) or RIGHT (1,6) which will be free after I move? But note: if I don't eat the apple, (1,5) remains. However, eating it now is better.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,6) moves away from the apple and towards the enemy? Enemy might move DOWN to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,5). So (2,6) is safe this turn.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nDOWN to (1,5) is the best because it immediately collects an apple, increasing my score to 8 and length to 9. This brings me closer to the enemy's score (9) and provides growth for future survival.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), my head will be at (1,5) and my body will grow by one segment (so the tail doesn't move). The new body will be: head at (1,5), then (1,6), (1,7), ... (4,8) and the tail remains at (4,8) for this turn? Actually, when you eat an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body extends by one at the head. So the new body will be longer.\n\nFrom (1,5) next turn, I can consider:\n- DOWN to (1,4) (free)\n- LEFT to (0,5) (free)\n- RIGHT to (2,5) (free) - but note enemy is at (4,5) and might move towards me? But safe for now.\n\nSo multiple options.\n\nLEFT or RIGHT this turn would delay eating the apple, and the enemy might get it? But enemy is at (4,5) and can only move DOWN or RIGHT. To get to (1,5), it would take at least 3 moves (e.g., DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then LEFT to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,5)? Not direct. So I have priority.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is optimal.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), consider moving towards (3,0) (down and left) or (6,1)/(6,2) (right and down). Avoid the enemy which is likely to move towards the apples on the right. Also note the apple at (8,8) is far. Keep an eye on enemy #0's movements to avoid head-on collisions. Since I am shorter (9 vs 10 after eating), avoid direct confrontations.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 7): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 5): empty (apple there).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 6): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6): empty.  \n\nEnemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (1, 5), it eats apple and grows, staying at (1, 5) next turn.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 6), it\u2019s 3 cells away from my head (4, 5).  \nNo immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (3, 0), (1, 5), (6, 2), (8, 8), (6, 1).  \nFrom (4, 5):  \n- (1, 5) dist 3  \n- (6, 2) dist 5  \n- (6, 1) dist 6  \n- (3, 0) dist 9  \n- (8, 8) dist 13  \n\nClosest reachable apple without head\u2011on risk is (6, 2) or (6, 1) \u2014 but (6, 2) is currently occupied by my tail (5, 3) \u2192 (5, 2) is tail end? Wait, my body ends at (5, 3) currently, tail is at (5, 3). Actually check: body list last is (5, 3), so tail is at (5, 3). That means (6, 2) is empty now. Yes, (6, 2) is apple and not occupied.  \nSo (6, 2) is 5 steps away, (6, 1) is 6 steps away.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Path to (6, 2) and safety:**  \nTo reach (6, 2): need to go RIGHT then DOWN etc.  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (5, 5), next turn I can go DOWN to (5, 4), then LEFT? That moves away from apple. Better: from (5, 5) go RIGHT to (6, 5) next turn? (6, 5) is my body currently, but after tail moves, (6, 5) might still be occupied? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent body: head (4, 5), then (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3).  \nAfter I move RIGHT to (5, 5), body becomes: (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3) \u2014 wait, I grew? No, I didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays same, tail moves off (5, 3). So new body: (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3).  \nSo (6, 5) still occupied next turn. So from (5, 5) next turn, UP (5, 6) occupied, DOWN (5, 4) free, LEFT (4, 5) occupied (old head), RIGHT (6, 5) occupied. So only DOWN is safe next turn if I go RIGHT now. That\u2019s risky \u2014 only one safe follow\u2011up.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Check LEFT and DOWN for future options:**  \n- LEFT to (3, 5): from there, next turn: UP (3, 6) occupied, DOWN (3, 4) free, LEFT (2, 5) free, RIGHT (4, 5) occupied. So two safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN to (4, 4): from there, next turn: UP (4, 5) occupied, DOWN (4, 3) free, LEFT (3, 4) free, RIGHT (5, 4) free. So three safe moves next turn.\n\nDOWN gives most options.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move and apple (1, 5):**  \nEnemy likely goes DOWN to (1, 5) to eat apple, growing to length 9. That puts enemy head at (1, 5) next turn, closer to me but not an immediate threat if I go DOWN to (4, 4).  \nIf I go LEFT toward (3, 5), I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s possible future path after it eats apple \u2014 could risk head\u2011on later.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long\u2011term plan:**  \nMy tail will keep moving, freeing (6, 3) and (6, 4) soon. Going DOWN to (4, 4) keeps me central, with access to lower\u2011left apples (3, 0) and also a path to (6, 2) via (4, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (6, 2) once tail clears.  \nAvoid racing enemy for (1, 5) \u2014 let them have it, focus on bottom apples and staying safe.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose move:**  \nRIGHT leads to dead\u2011end next turn (only DOWN safe).  \nLEFT reduces future options slightly and moves toward enemy.  \nDOWN gives most options, moves away from enemy, keeps path to apples open.\n\nDOWN\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 4), assess enemy position. If enemy ate (1, 5), they\u2019ll be longer but far away. Consider path to (6, 2) via (4, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (6, 2) after tail clears. Avoid boxing self in; prefer moves that keep \u22652 safe follow\u2011ups.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (3,0) (down and left) and (6,1)/(6,2) (right and down). Also (9,5) is far right.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,4) moves towards (3,0) and avoids the enemy.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,5) moves to the edge, which might limit future moves (only DOWN to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,5) but that is my head? Actually, next turn from (0,5) I can go DOWN (0,4) or RIGHT (1,5) which will be free? But (1,5) is currently my head and will become body next turn? Actually, after I move, my head leaves (1,5) and it becomes body. So (1,5) will be occupied by my body next turn. So from (0,5), RIGHT to (1,5) would be unsafe next turn. So LEFT is not great for future options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,5) moves towards the enemy and the apples at (6,1)/(6,2). But enemy might also move towards those apples. Since enemy is longer (10 vs 9), avoid direct confrontation.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nDOWN to (1,4) is the best because:\n- It moves towards the apple at (3,0) (which is safe and uncontested by the enemy? Enemy is at (4,4) and might go DOWN/LEFT to (3,3) or similar, but (3,0) is far down).\n- It avoids the enemy and keeps distance.\n- From (1,4), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,3) (towards (3,0)), LEFT to (0,4) (edge), or RIGHT to (2,4) (towards other apples). Multiple options.\n- LEFT to (0,5) leads to a dead-end with only DOWN and RIGHT (but RIGHT is back to my body) next turn.\n- RIGHT to (2,5) moves closer to enemy and might lead to head-on collision risks.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,4), aim to collect the apple at (3,0) by moving down and left. Then consider the apples at (6,1) and (6,2) but be cautious of enemy #0 which is likely to target those. Since enemy has 9 apples (length 10) and I have 8 (length 9), I need to catch up but avoid risky encounters. Also note the apple at (8,8) is far and might be a trap. Prioritize safe growth.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 apples list says (1, 5) is not listed; apples are (3, 0), (6, 2), (8, 8), (6, 1), (9, 5). So (1, 5) is not an apple now \u2014 my earlier rationale from last turn mentioned (1, 5) as apple, but that\u2019s outdated. Actually, last turn\u2019s board showed apple at (1, 5) maybe? Let\u2019s check current board: at row 5 col 1 is \u20181\u2019 (enemy head), not \u2018A\u2019. So no apple there now.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s likely move: could go DOWN to (1, 4) or RIGHT to (2, 5) or LEFT to (0, 5).  \n\nDistance from enemy to me: from (1, 5) to (4, 4) is 3 units in Manhattan distance.

Wait, after move, tail is at (6, 3) still? Let\u2019s simulate: current body length 10 (head + 9 body segments). Moving without eating \u2192 head moves to (5, 4), each body segment shifts: old head (4, 4) becomes segment 2, (4, 5) becomes segment 3, \u2026, last segment (6, 3) is removed.

So (5, 3) empty, (6, 3) empty.  \n\nSo from (5, 4) next turn:  \nUP (5, 5) empty, DOWN (5, 3) empty, LEFT (4, 4) occupied (my body), RIGHT (6, 4) occupied (my body).  \nSo only UP and DOWN safe next turn \u2014 two options.  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (3, 4):**  \nFrom (3, 4) next turn:  \nUP (3, 5) occupied (my body segment 4 in new list), DOWN (3, 3) empty, LEFT (2, 4) empty, RIGHT (4, 4) occupied.  \nSo DOWN and LEFT safe \u2014 two options.  \n\n---\n\n**DOWN to (4, 3):**  \nFrom (4, 3) next turn:  \nUP (4, 4) occupied (my body), DOWN (4, 2) empty, LEFT (3, 3) empty, RIGHT (5, 3) empty.  \nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe \u2014 three options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Path to apple (6, 2):**  \n\nFrom (4, 3): can go RIGHT to (5, 3) next turn (empty), then RIGHT to (6, 3) (empty after tail moved), then DOWN to (6, 2) apple.  \n\nFrom (5, 4): to reach (6, 2) you\u2019d need to go DOWN to (5, 3) then RIGHT to (6, 3) then DOWN to (6, 2) \u2014 similar steps but starting further right.  \n\nFrom (3, 4): longer path to (6, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends and enemy:**  \n\nEnemy at (1, 5) might move toward center. If I go LEFT to (3, 4), I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s possible path if they go RIGHT to (2, 5) then (3, 5), etc.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (4, 3) keeps distance, opens more options, and aligns with path to (6, 2) after tail clears (6, 4) and (6, 3) are already empty next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \n\nFrom (4, 3), check if (6, 2) still apple. If yes, path: RIGHT to (5, 3) next turn, then RIGHT to (6, 3), then DOWN to (6, 2). Monitor enemy movement \u2014 they may go for (9, 5) or (8, 8). Keep options open, avoid boxing self in top-right later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nDOWN gives most future safe moves, moves toward bottom apples (3, 0) as backup, and starts route to (6, 2).  \n\n**DOWN**",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (3,0) (down and left). Also (6,1) and (6,2) are to the right and down.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,3) moves directly towards (3,0). This is a safe path with no obstacles.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,4) goes to the edge. From there, next turn I can only go DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4) (which will be my body next turn). So LEFT limits future options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,4) moves towards the enemy and the apples at (6,1)/(6,2). Since enemy is longer (10 vs 9) and might also target those apples, this could be risky.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nDOWN to (1,3) is the best because:\n- It directly progresses towards the apple at (3,0). From (1,3), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,2) or LEFT to (0,3) or RIGHT to (2,3) (all likely safe) to continue towards (3,0).\n- It avoids the enemy and maintains distance.\n- LEFT leads to a dead-end with limited moves next turn.\n- RIGHT moves towards the enemy and might lead to a confrontation.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nCollect the apple at (3,0) safely. After that, consider moving towards the apples at (6,1) and (6,2) but be cautious of enemy #0. Since enemy has 9 apples (length 10) and I have 8 (length 9), I need to catch up but avoid risky encounters. The apple at (8,8) is too far and might not be worth it yet. Prioritize safe growth and avoid getting trapped.\n\nDOWN",

From (6, 2), possible exits:  \n- If I come from (6, 3) after RIGHT move now, then after eating at (6, 2), my body will be longer, but (6,1) is apple, could eat that next.  \n- If I come from (5, 2) after DOWN now, then after eating at (6, 2), (6,1) is adjacent for possible next apple.\n\nBoth fine. But RIGHT now gives slightly more central position and keeps both (6, 2) and (9, 5) reachable later.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT sets up direct path to closest apple (6, 2) via (6, 3) next turn, keeps distance from enemy, and maintains good options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 3), if apple (6, 2) still there, go RIGHT to (6, 3) (safe unless enemy moves there, unlikely), then next turn DOWN to eat it. Monitor enemy movement toward (9, 5) or (8, 8). Avoid getting trapped in top-right later.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (3,0) (down and left). From (1,3), moving DOWN to (1,2) gets me closer to (3,0) (which is at (3,0) - so I need to go left and down).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,3) is on the edge. Next turn, I can go DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3) (which will be my body). So LEFT limits options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,3) moves towards the enemy and the apples at (6,1)/(6,2). Enemy might also target those, so this is risky.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nDOWN to (1,2) is the best because:\n- It progresses directly towards the apple at (3,0). From (1,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2) to continue towards (3,0).\n- It avoids the enemy and maintains distance.\n- LEFT leads to a dead-end with limited moves next turn.\n- RIGHT moves towards the enemy and might lead to a confrontation.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue towards (3,0) safely. After eating that apple, consider moving towards (6,1) or (6,2) but be cautious of enemy #0. Since enemy has 9 apples (length 10) and I have 8 (length 9), I need to catch up without risking a head-on collision. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (3,0) (down and left). From (1,1), moving DOWN to (1,0) gets me closer to (3,0) (which is at (3,0) - so I need to go left and down).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,1) is on the edge. Next turn, I can go DOWN to (0,0) (which is free) or RIGHT to (1,1) (which will be my body) or UP to (0,2) (free). So LEFT has options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,1) moves towards the enemy and the apples at (6,1)/(7,3). Enemy might target (6,1) this turn (via DOWN) and eat it, so this is less attractive.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nDOWN to (1,0) is the best because:\n- It progresses directly towards the apple at (3,0). From (1,0), next turn I can go LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0) to continue towards (3,0).\n- It avoids the enemy and maintains distance.\n- LEFT (0,1) is also safe and leads to (0,0) next turn, but DOWN is more direct.\n- RIGHT moves towards the enemy and might lead to a confrontation.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue towards (3,0) safely. After eating that apple, consider moving towards (6,1) or (7,3) but be cautious of enemy #0. Since enemy has 10 apples (length 11) and I have 8 (length 9), I need to catch up without risking a head-on collision. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nDOWN",

UP eats apple (7, 3) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT:**  \nDOWN gets immediate apple (6, 1) and keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT sets up eating (7, 3) next turn (apple still there) and also gives 3 safe moves.  \nLEFT reduces future options to 2 moves, so less flexible.  \n\nEnemy is far away, so immediate apple grab is safe.  \nScore: I have 10 apples, enemy has 8.

If enemy is far, go DOWN to (6, 0) to move toward (3, 0), else go LEFT/RIGHT to avoid potential collision.  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n- The closest apple is (3,0) (2 right) and (4,1) (3 right, 1 up). From (1,0), moving RIGHT to (2,0) gets me closer to both (3,0) and (4,1). Moving LEFT to (0,0) moves away from these apples.\n- Moving RIGHT is more promising for apple collection.\n- Also, (0,0) is a corner.

RIGHT gives more options.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nRIGHT to (2,0) is better because:\n- It progresses towards the apples at (3,0) and (4,1). From (2,0), next turn I can go UP to (2,1) (towards (4,1)) or RIGHT to (3,0) (to eat the apple) or DOWN (off board) or LEFT (back to body). So UP and RIGHT are safe next moves.\n- LEFT (0,0) is safe but leads to a corner with fewer options. It doesn't help in apple collection.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove towards (3,0) and then (4,1). After that, consider (7,3) or (9,5) but be cautious of enemy #0. Avoid getting trapped in corners. Since enemy has 11 apples (length 12) and I have 8 (length 9), I need to catch up without risking collisions. Stay away from the enemy's path if possible.\n\nRIGHT",

This is risky \u2014 reduces future moves.\n\n**LEFT to (5, 1):**  \nNew body: (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)  \nFrom (5, 1):  \n- UP (5, 2) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN (5, 0) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT (4, 1) \u2192 apple (4, 1)  \n- RIGHT (6, 1) \u2192 occupied (my body segment 2)  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (3 options). LEFT eats apple next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 1):**  \nNew body: (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)  \nFrom (7, 1):  \n- UP (7, 2) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN (7, 0) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT (6, 1) \u2192 occupied (my body segment 2)  \n- RIGHT (8, 1) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (3 options). UP next turn leads toward (7, 3) apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT:**  \nDOWN gives only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 too limiting.  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves and sets up eating (4, 1) next turn.  \nRIGHT gives 3 safe moves and sets up eating (7, 3) later.  \n\n(4, 1) is closer than (7, 3) from my position now. Eating sooner grows my lead (11 vs 8 apples).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan after this move:**  \nIf LEFT now, next turn from (5, 1) go LEFT to eat (4, 1). Then from (4, 1) I can go DOWN toward (3, 0) or UP to (4, 2) etc.  \nIf RIGHT now, next turn from (7, 1) go UP toward (7, 3), but that\u2019s two turns to get apple.  \n\nLEFT is better for immediate future apple and keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 1), go LEFT to eat (4, 1) unless enemy moves into (4, 1) this turn \u2014 unlikely given enemy is at (1, 0) and can only go LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, rule: If my head moves into any snake's body (including enemy's body), I die. But enemy's head is not \"body\" \u2014 but if enemy stays there, we occupy same cell next turn? Actually, simultaneous moves: if I go DOWN to (3, 1) and enemy moves away, I survive. But if enemy stays at (3, 1) (by moving DOWN to (3, 0) \u2014 illegal, enemy can't go DOWN because (3,0) is its own body), so enemy cannot stay at (3,1) because it must move. So (3,1) will be empty after enemy moves? Let's check enemy's options from (2,1) later. For now, (3,1) is risky if enemy moves into it from its current position? No, enemy at (2,1) can only move to (2,2), (2,0), (1,1), (3,1). So (3,1) is a possible destination for enemy. If I go to (3,1) and enemy goes to (3,1), head-on collision \u2192 both die. So DOWN is risky.  \n- LEFT (2, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4, 2): occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo physically possible: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat check:**  \nEnemy head at (2, 1). Possible moves:  \n- UP (2, 2)  \n- DOWN (2, 0) \u2014 occupied by its own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (1, 1) \u2014 occupied by its own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (3, 1)  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (3, 1).  \n\nNow check my safe moves vs enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n\n1. If I go UP to (3, 3): enemy can't reach (3,3) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n2. If I go DOWN to (3, 1): enemy could go RIGHT to (3,1) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. So DOWN is risky.  \n3. If I go LEFT to (2, 2): enemy could go UP to (2,2) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. So LEFT is risky.  \n\nSo only UP is definitely safe from head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check for immediate death from self/body:**  \nUP (3,3): empty in board display.  \nDOWN (3,1): not occupied by any body currently (enemy head will move away or stay? but if enemy moves away, it's empty). But if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,1) and I go DOWN to (3,1), collision. So not safe in simultaneous sense.  \nLEFT (2,2): empty now, but enemy could go UP to (2,2) \u2192 collision.  \n\nSo only UP avoids possible head-on.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future move options after UP:**  \nIf I go UP to (3,3):  \nNew body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6)  \nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,2): occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (2,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,3): occupied by my body (segment 10) \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo next turn I\u2019d have UP and LEFT available \u2014 two options, okay.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (3,3):  \n- Closest apple is (4,8) distance 5, (7,3) distance 4, (8,0) far, (9,5) far, (8,8) far.  \nUP then maybe go right toward (7,3) or (4,8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (2,2), then (3,1) is empty. If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,1), then (2,2) empty.  \nSo my DOWN or LEFT each risk collision if enemy chooses that same cell.  \n\nGiven my lead (12 vs 10), I should avoid 50/50 death risk. UP is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter UP to (3,3), next turn consider going LEFT to (2,3) to approach apple (4,8) via a longer path but safely away from enemy. Enemy will be at (2,2) or (3,1). If enemy at (2,2), it's close; avoid moving into (2,3) if enemy could go to (2,3) next turn \u2014 but that's future calculation.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP is the only move with no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\nUP",

Wait, check: enemy body after moving to (2,5) will be [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)]. So (2,4) is its new neck \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (1,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,5): my body \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP (2,6) or LEFT (1,5).  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (2,6), that\u2019s one of my possible moves from (3,6) \u2014 so I should avoid moving LEFT into (2,6) if enemy might go there. But I can\u2019t be sure, so next turn I\u2019ll need to check again.  \n\nClosest apple: (4,8) is 2 away in Manhattan distance from (3,6) \u2014 actually (4,8) is at \u0394x=1, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 3.  \nFrom (3,6), going UP or RIGHT gets me closer to (4,8).  \n\nLong-term: I need to avoid being forced into enemy\u2019s path while collecting apples. My snake is longer, so I have less space to maneuver. I should aim to go toward (4,8) via UP then RIGHT, but be ready to adjust if enemy blocks.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nOnly UP is safe this turn.\n\nUP",

If enemy is at (1,5), it might aim for apple (4,8) too.  \nIf I go UP to (3,8), next turn I can go RIGHT to (4,8) if enemy isn\u2019t there.  \nIf enemy goes (1,5) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (4,8) would take many turns, so I can likely beat it to (4,8) from (3,8) or (4,7).  \n\nBut going RIGHT now to (4,7) puts me closer to enemy if it\u2019s at (1,5) \u2014 distance 3 vs from (3,8) distance 4. Slightly safer to go UP first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,8), check if apple (4,8) still there and if enemy is close. If safe, go RIGHT to eat it. If enemy threatens (4,8), maybe go UP to (3,9) or LEFT to (2,8) to stay safe. Keep moving toward board center/right where apples are clustered. Avoid getting pinned near top-left by enemy. Use length to block enemy if it tries to cut me off.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP is safe, progresses toward closest apple, and keeps options open.\n\nUP",

None of my target cells are in enemy body.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (8,8), (9,5), (7,3), (8,0), (6,8).  \nClosest apple to me is (6,8) at distance 2 (right 2).  \nRIGHT moves me to (5,8), closer to (6,8).  \nUP (4,9) moves away from most apples.  \nDOWN (4,7) moves toward (7,3) eventually but not directly closer to nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety and space:**  \nFrom (5,8) next turn: possible moves UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8) (my body), RIGHT (6,8) (apple).  \nSo next turn I could eat (6,8) if I go RIGHT now, then RIGHT again next turn.  \nBut need to check if enemy could interfere: enemy at (0,2) far away, but could move toward center.  \nFrom (5,8) I\u2019d have 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.\n\nFrom (4,9): next turn moves LEFT (3,9), DOWN (4,8) body, RIGHT (5,9). Only 2 safe moves, and top row is limited space. Riskier.\n\nFrom (4,7): next turn moves UP (4,8) body, DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7) body, RIGHT (5,7). Only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Also somewhat limited.\n\nSo RIGHT gives best future options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter moving to (5,8), eat (6,8) next turn if safe. Then consider moving down toward (7,3) or up toward (8,8). Keep enemy on left side in mind\u2014they may try to cut off bottom-left area, but with my length I can control right side. Avoid getting pinned against top or right edge.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves from (7,0):  \n- UP (7,1): empty.  \n- DOWN (7,-1): off-board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (6,0): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (8,0): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT.  \nFrom my head (7,4), enemy is at Manhattan distance 4 vertically.  \nCould they reach me this turn? No.  \nCould they move into a cell I might move into?  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,3), enemy\u2019s UP to (7,1) then next turn maybe up again, but not this turn.  \nIf I go LEFT to (6,4) or RIGHT to (8,4), no overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn.  \nSo no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nFrom (7,4):  \n- DOWN (7,3) \u2192 apple immediately.  \n- LEFT (6,4) \u2192 farther from apples except maybe (8,0) is far.  \n- RIGHT (8,4) \u2192 closer to (9,5) (Manhattan 2 from (8,4) to (9,5) = 2).  \n\nEating apple grows me by 1, so tail stays at (3,2) one more turn before moving.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (7,3) and eat apple:  \nNext turn from (7,3):  \n- UP (7,4): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (7,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (6,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,3): empty.  \n3 safe moves.  \n\nIf LEFT to (6,4):  \nNext turn from (6,4):  \n- UP (6,5): my body (segment from earlier) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (6,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (5,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,4): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n2 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (8,4):  \nNext turn from (8,4):  \n- UP (8,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (8,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (7,4): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9,4): empty.  \n3 safe moves.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT only 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term considerations**  \nEating apple at (7,3) grows me, but my tail is at (3,2), so after growth, tail will move to (3,3) next turn if I eat now. That opens up space in column 3 row 2.  \n\nEnemy is at bottom left, might move up toward apples (8,0) or (9,1). If I go DOWN to eat (7,3), I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s area, but still safe for now.  \n\nMy body blocks top right area; moving DOWN keeps me in more open space (rows 0\u20134).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT toward (9,5), I\u2019m moving into narrower area near right wall with my body above \u2014 could be risky later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nAfter eating (7,3), I\u2019ll be at length 18. Next turn from (7,3), I can go DOWN to (7,2) or LEFT/RIGHT to stay in open area.  \n\nLEFT (6,4) reduces options next turn \u2014 not good.  \n\nRIGHT (8,4) is safe but delays apple.  \n\nGiven I want to maximize apples toward 30, eating now is good. Also, enemy has 11 apples, I have 16, so extending lead is wise.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (7,3), consider moving DOWN or LEFT to stay in open bottom-left area, avoid trapping myself near my long body in top right. Keep an eye on enemy moving up from row 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN to eat apple at (7,3), grow, keep options open.\n\nDOWN",

Given that the enemy has 16 apples vs my 12, I need to collect apples efficiently to catch up.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9,0), collect (9,1) next turn.

Possible moves from (8, 0):  \n- UP (8, 1): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, -1): off-board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (7, 0): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 0): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT.  \nFrom my head (7, 3), enemy is at Manhattan distance 5. No overlap possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nFrom (7, 3):  \n- DOWN (7, 2): farther from all apples.  \n- LEFT (6, 3): closer to (2, 8) or (1, 8) but still far (Manhattan 5 to (2, 8)).  \n- RIGHT (8, 3): closer to (9, 5) (Manhattan 3) and (9, 1) (Manhattan 4).  \n\nRIGHT seems best for apple targeting.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (7, 2):  \nNext turn from (7, 2):  \n- UP (7, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (7, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (8, 2): empty.  \n3 safe moves.  \n\nIf LEFT to (6, 3):  \nNext turn from (6, 3):  \n- UP (6, 4): my body (segment from earlier) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (6, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (5, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (7, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n2 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (8, 3):  \nNext turn from (8, 3):  \n- UP (8, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 3): empty.  \n3 safe moves.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT only 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term considerations**  \nMy body occupies top right area (rows 5\u20138, cols 3\u20138). Moving RIGHT toward (9, 5) could eventually trap me near the right wall if I\u2019m not careful, but there\u2019s still space below.  \nEnemy is at bottom left, moving up slowly.  \nApple at (9, 5) is reachable in 3 moves if I go RIGHT now, then RIGHT again to (9, 3), then UP to (9, 4), then UP to (9, 5) \u2014 but need to check body blocks.  \n\nActually, from (8, 3):  \n- Next turn UP to (8, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n- Then RIGHT to (9, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n- Then UP to (9, 5) \u2192 apple.  \n\nThat path seems clear of my body.  \n\nLEFT leads toward my tail area (col 3 row 2) and apples at (2, 8) and (1, 8) but requires going around my body.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nRIGHT keeps me near wall but with escape downward.  \nDOWN opens more central space but delays apples.  \n\nGiven my lead (17 vs 12 apples), securing another apple soon is good. RIGHT sets up for (9, 5) apple in 3 turns.  \n\nAlso, enemy could go for (9, 1) apple \u2014 if they go UP then RIGHT repeatedly, they could get there in maybe 4 turns. But I can get (9, 5) before they threaten me.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT to (8, 3), then likely UP to (8, 4) next turn to approach (9, 5). Keep checking enemy movement \u2014 they might move toward (9, 1). Avoid getting pinned against right wall by planning an exit downward after eating apple.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves from (9, 0):  \n- UP (9, 1): empty (apple there).  \n- DOWN (9, -1): off-board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (8, 0): its body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (10, 0): off-board \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (9, 1) this turn (and will eat apple at (9, 1), growing to length 14).  \nFrom my head (8, 3), enemy will be at (9, 1) after move \u2014 Manhattan distance from me = |8-9| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.  \nNo direct collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nFrom (8, 3):  \n- UP (8, 4): closer to (8, 9) (Manhattan 5) and (9, 5) (Manhattan 2 from (8,4) to (9,5) = 2).  \n- DOWN (8, 2): farther from most apples.  \n- RIGHT (9, 3): closer to (9, 5) (Manhattan 2) and (8, 9) (Manhattan 6).  \n\nUP and RIGHT both approach (9, 5) well. UP gives more space to maneuver near top right apples.  \nApple (9, 5) is 2 moves away via UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf UP to (8, 4):  \nNext turn from (8, 4):  \n- UP (8, 5): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (7, 4): my body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 4): empty.  \n2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\nIf DOWN to (8, 2):  \nNext turn from (8, 2):  \n- UP (8, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (8, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): empty.  \n3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9, 3):  \nNext turn from (9, 3):  \n- UP (9, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (9, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (8, 3): my body (old head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (10, 3): off-board \u2192 illegal.  \n2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).  \n\nDOWN gives most future options (3 safe moves), UP and RIGHT give 2 each.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy future threat**  \nEnemy will be at (9, 1) after this turn.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 3), enemy could go UP to (9, 2) next turn, putting us close.  \nIf I go UP to (8, 4), enemy is farther.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8, 2), enemy is at (9, 1), Manhattan distance 2 from me \u2014 possible collision next turn if we both move toward each other (e.g., me RIGHT to (9, 2), enemy UP to (9, 2) \u2192 head-on collision).  \nSo DOWN might be riskier next turn if enemy moves UP again.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI want apple (9, 5) soon.  \nFrom (8, 3):  \n- UP to (8, 4) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (9, 4) \u2192 then UP to (9, 5) eats apple.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 3) \u2192 next turn UP to (9, 4) \u2192 then UP to (9, 5) eats apple.  \n\nBoth sequences work, but UP first keeps me farther from enemy\u2019s possible path.  \nEnemy might go for (8, 9) apple after (9, 1), but that\u2019s far for them.  \n\nGiven my lead (17 vs 12), I can play safe and secure (9, 5) while avoiding potential head-on with enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP to (8, 4) this turn. Next turn, if safe, go RIGHT to (9, 4) to set up apple (9, 5) grab on turn after. Watch enemy movement \u2014 they\u2019ll be at (9, 1) after this turn, could move UP to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 1). Avoid moving to (9, 3) or (9, 2) while enemy is near.  \n\nUP",

Moving UP toward (9,5) seems optimal as it's the closest apple to my current position. Moving LEFT would take me away from the closest apple and might lead me toward the enemy's long body in the upper-left area.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (9,2), continue moving UP toward (9,5) apple.

The apple at (9,5) is strategically valuable as it's in my territory (right column) and away from enemy concentration.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving UP to reach (9,5) apple.

So (9, 3) will be enemy body next turn \u2192 illegal for me.  \n- LEFT (8, 4): my body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT off-board \u2192 illegal.  \nSo from (9, 4) next turn, all 4 moves are illegal \u2192 certain death.  \n\nThus DOWN is a trap even if no head-on collision now \u2014 it leaves me with zero safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nDOWN is unsafe (possible head-on and definite trap next turn).  \nUP is safe this turn and leaves 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nAfter UP to (9, 6), next turn I should move LEFT to (8, 6) to get away from right edge and toward center. Apples at (8, 9) and (6, 7) are possible targets later. Avoid letting enemy cut off escape routes.  \n\nUP",
