This is a direct vertical path with no obstacles. I should prioritize collecting this nearby apple first, then reassess. The enemy at (4, 9) is far away and unlikely to contest this apple.\n\nUP is the optimal move - it keeps me safe, gets me closer to the nearest apple (7, 5), and maintains all future options.\n\nUP",

Safe, on board ✓\n2. **DOWN**: (7, 4) → (7, 3) - Safe, on board ✓\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 4) → (6, 4) - Safe, on board ✓\n4. **RIGHT**: (7, 4) → (8, 4) - Safe, on board ✓\n\nAll moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Apple proximity analysis:**\nFrom (7, 4):\n- **(7, 5)**: 1 cell UP - **DIRECTLY ABOVE, CLOSEST**\n- **(4, 3)**: 3 LEFT, 1 DOWN = distance 4\n- **(3, 2)**: 4 LEFT, 2 DOWN = distance 6\n- **(8, 8)**: 1 RIGHT, 4 UP = distance 5\n- **(0, 7)**: 7 LEFT, 3 UP = distance 10\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nMoving UP takes me directly to the apple at (7, 5). This is an obvious next step:\n- I'm one cell away from the apple\n- The path is unobstructed\n- After eating it, I'll grow to length 2\n- The enemy at (7, 8) is moving away or will be in a different area - no collision risk this turn\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 8) is 4 cells directly above me on the same column. Since both snakes are on the same x-coordinate, I need to monitor for potential collisions. However, on this turn, moving UP to (7, 5) is safe and gets me the nearest apple.\n\n**Future plan for next turns:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 5), reassess. The next closest apples will be (4, 3) and (3, 2) in the left-center area. Build length by collecting these, then move toward (8, 8) if it's still available. Avoid the enemy snake's territory in the upper region (above y=7).\n\nUP",
