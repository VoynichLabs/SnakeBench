Importantly, the apple at (6,2) is just a short distance away, and by moving down we can plan to go left on the next turn to reach it.\n\nConsidering safety and proximity to an apple, I\u2019m choosing to steer our snake downward to (7,3), positioning us to move closer to the nearby apple at (6,2).\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN."
