The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (7, 3).\n\nApples are at: A1=(0, 7), A2=(9, 1), A3=(4, 4), A4=(4, 3), A5=(3, 5).\n\nMy snake has no body, so I don't need to worry about self-collision except for moving backwards. My head is the only segment.\n\n**1. Analyze Possible Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (3, 3))**\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 4))**:\n    *   Off board? No (0 <= 4 <= 9).\n    *   Into own body? No body. Safe.\n    *   Into enemy body? Enemy is at (7, 3). Safe.\n    *   Head-on collision risk? Enemy moves from (7, 3). If enemy moves to (3, 4) AND I move to (3, 4), we collide. Enemy moves: UP(7, 4), DOWN(7, 2), LEFT(6, 3), RIGHT(8, 3). No collision possible this turn.\n    *   Apple proximity: (3, 4) is adjacent to A5=(3, 5) (UP) and A3=(4, 4) (RIGHT). This looks good.\n\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 2))**:\n    *   Off board? No (0 <= 2 <= 9).\n    *   Into own body? No body. Safe.\n    *   Into enemy body? Safe.\n    *   Head-on collision risk? Analyzing enemy moves: (7, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (8, 3). Safe.\n    *   Apple proximity: Moves away from nearest apples.\n\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 3))**:\n    *   Off board? No (0 <= 2 <= 9).\n    *   Into own body? No body. Safe.\n    *   Into enemy body? Safe.\n    *   Head-on collision risk? Analyzing enemy moves: (7, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (8, 3). Safe.\n    *   Apple proximity: Moves towards A1=(0, 7) indirectly, but generally sideways.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 3))**:\n    *   Off board? No (0 <= 4 <= 9).\n    *   Into own body? No body. Safe.\n    *   Into enemy body? Safe.\n    *   Head-on collision risk? Analyzing enemy moves: (7, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (8, 3). Safe.\n    *   Apple proximity: **This target cell (4, 3) is an apple (A4)**. Moving here means I eat A4, grow, and score 1 point.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves**\n\nAll four moves are safe regarding immediate self-destruction or opponent body collision this turn.\n\nThe main strategic goal is to acquire apples while staying safe.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 3))**: Eats an apple immediately. This is the strongest deterministic move when available and safe.\n    *   New head position: (4, 3).\n    *   Snake 1 will now be longer (conceptually, though its body coordinates won't appear until next turn when the tail doesn't move).\n    *   It puts me adjacent to A3=(4, 4) (if I move UP next turn) and very near A5=(3, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 4))**: Moves towards A5=(3, 5). This is also good, setting up an apple capture next turn if the apple isn't taken by the enemy, and the enemy doesn't move there. It also puts me adjacent to A3=(4, 4).\n\n*   DOWN and LEFT are less immediately rewarding in terms of apple acquisition.\n\n**3. Enemy Reaction Consideration**\n\nEnemy snake is at (7, 3). Apples are: (0, 7), (9, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 5).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 3):\nI eat A4.\nEnemy needs to decide its move. It is relatively far from all apples. (7, 3) is 3 units away from A3(4, 4) Manhattan distance, 4 units away from A5(3, 5), and 2 units away from A2(9, 1).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 4):\nI am targeting A5(3, 5) next turn, or A3(4, 4).\n\nSince RIGHT offers an immediate guaranteed reward (eating A4 at (4, 3)), it is the superior aggressive choice among safe moves.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to (4, 3) to consume Apple A4.\n\nShort-term plan: After eating (4, 3), my new head position is (4, 3). The next target should be A3=(4, 4) (if available) or A5=(3, 5). My body will grow by one segment next turn, but since I have no body now, this only adds a tail segment that stays put next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on clearing apples adjacent to my current mass, prioritizing pathing that maintains central board presence and access back toward A1(0, 7) if needed.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n    *   Head-on collision risk? No risk.\n    *   Apple proximity: Moves toward A2=(9, 1).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves**\n\nMove UP to (4, 4) yields an immediate apple (A3). This is the highest priority action when safe.\n\nIf I move UP:\nNew head: (4, 4). Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3)]. Apples: 3.\nI will be adjacent to A5=(3, 5).\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis**\nEnemy at (8, 3) is far from current apples A1(0, 7), A5(3, 5), A2(9, 1). It might try to move towards A2 (9, 1) or perhaps try to close distance to me if it senses a threat. Since I have a guaranteed apple move (UP), I should take it.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to (4, 4) to consume Apple A3.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, my snake will have two body segments: [(4, 3), (3, 3)]. My next target will be A5=(3, 5), which is 1 move UP then 1 move LEFT, or 1 move LEFT then 1 move UP from (4, 4). I need to ensure I don't run into my own tail when I move LEFT next turn, but since my tail segment is now (3, 3) and the segment before it is (4, 3), moving LEFT from (4, 4) to (3, 4) is safe this time.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Prioritize adjacent apples. Avoid reversing direction immediately unless necessary for survival/better pathing.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules and win conditions:\n- All snakes move simultaneously each turn.\n- Each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",

Analyze Possible Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (4, 4), Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3)])**\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 3))**: This is the segment directly behind the head. **DOWN is illegal (backwards move into the body)**.\n\n*   **UP (to (4, 5))**:\n    *   Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Apple proximity: Moves towards A5=(3, 5).\n\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 4))**:\n    *   Safe from self-collision (Tail is at (3, 3)).\n    *   Apple proximity: Moves towards A5=(3, 5).\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 4))**:\n    *   Safe from self-collision.\n    *   Moves away from high-density apple area but keeps options open.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis & Collision Check**\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (8, 3).\nThe enemy could move towards A2=(9, 1). Potential moves for Enemy #0: UP(8, 4), DOWN(8, 2), LEFT(7, 3), RIGHT(9, 3). None pose an immediate threat to me or my potential paths other than potentially blocking access to (9, 1).\n\n**3. Apple Prioritization**\nRemaining apples: A1=(0, 7), A5=(3, 5), A2=(9, 1).\nThe closest viable apple is A5=(3, 5).\n\n*   Moving UP to (4, 5) sets up for a direct path to A5=(3, 5) next turn (Move LEFT to (3, 5)).\n*   Moving LEFT to (3, 4) sets up for a direct path to A5=(3, 5) next turn (Move UP to (3, 5)).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT seem equally good for targeting A5=(3, 5). Let's look ahead.\n\nIf I choose **UP (to (4, 5))**:\nNext turn, I can move LEFT to (3, 5) and eat A5. My body would then be [(4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\n\nIf I choose **LEFT (to (3, 4))**:\nNext turn, I can move UP to (3, 5) and eat A5. My body would then be [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\n\nBoth paths are excellent for grabbing A5 next turn. Moving towards the apple is generally preferred. Let's choose UP to maintain a higher Y position slightly longer, perhaps avoiding any potential future blockage from the enemy further south, although this is a minor consideration currently.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to (4, 5) to set up eating A5=(3, 5) next turn.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**1.

Moving here means I eat A5, grow, and score 1 point.\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 5))**: Safe. Moved away from A5.\n\n**2. Apple Prioritization**\nThe absolute best move is to consume the adjacent apple A5 at (3, 5) by moving LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nNew head: (3, 5). Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. New Apples: 4.\nI will be positioned centrally, ready to plan exploration towards A1=(0, 7) or A2=(9, 1).\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis**\nEnemy at (8, 3). No immediate threat.

(Note: (7, 5) is an apple A_other, not confirmed if it's free or controlled by another snake, but it is listed as an available apple).\n\nCurrent head (3, 5). Snake length is 4.\nTargeting A1 (0, 7) requires roughly 3 moves (Left, Up, Up).\nTargeting A2 (9, 1) requires roughly 6 moves (Right, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down).\nTargeting A_other (7, 5) requires 4 moves (Right, Right, Right, Wait/Maneuver).\n\nGiven the current position (3, 5), moving LEFT to (2, 5) is the most direct path towards A1=(0, 7).\nMoving DOWN to (3, 4) keeps options open and is central.\nMoving UP to (3, 6) moves towards A1=(0, 7) indirectly.\n\nLet's aim for A1=(0, 7). The path is generally leftward/upward.\nPath Option 1: LEFT (2, 5) -> LEFT (1, 5) -> UP (1, 6) -> UP (1, 7) -> UP (1, 8) -> LEFT (0, 8) -> UP (0, 7). This seems circuitous due to the board boundaries, but we need to stay above Y=0.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 5):\nWe can move LEFT again next turn to (1, 5). Then we have to move UP twice to get to Y=7 before moving to X=0.\n(3, 5) -> L (2, 5) -> L (1, 5) -> U (1, 6) -> U (1, 7) -> L (0, 7) [EAT]. This takes 5 moves minimum.\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 6):\n(3, 5) -> U (3, 6) -> U (3, 7) -> L (2, 7) -> L (1, 7) -> L (0, 7) [EAT]. This takes 5 moves minimum.\n\nSince both lead to the apple in ~5 turns, choosing LEFT seems slightly better as it immediately reduces X error to the target X=0.\n\n**Enemy Check:** Enemy is at (8, 3). They are still far from A1. They might try to grab A_other=(7, 5). If they move towards (7, 5), they might go UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3). Staying focused on A1 seems wise.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT towards A1=(0, 7).\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**1.

Continue moving RIGHT until X=9 is reached, then move DOWN towards Y=1. Prioritize safety over speed until the body clears the center axis where the enemy is located. Avoid collision with Snake 0 (currently near 8, 5 if they went U, U).\n\n**1.

Continues movement towards the top edge.\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 7))**: Safe. Moves into the main open area.\n*   **LEFT**: Illegal (Off board X=-1).\n\n**2. Apple Prioritization**\nRemaining apples: A2=(9, 1), A_other=(7, 5).\n\nCurrent head (0, 7). Length 9.\nTargeting A2=(9, 1) requires moving far across the board (9 right, 6 down). Approx 15 steps minimum.\nTargeting A_other=(7, 5) requires moving 7 right, 2 down. Approx 9 steps minimum.\n\nThe path to (7, 5) is much shorter. (7, 5) is also adjacent to the area where the enemy snake #0 is located (8, 3).\n\nStrategy Note: Target (7, 5) first. Move RIGHT to move away from the top wall.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis**\nEnemy at (8, 3). They might move towards (9, 1) to claim A2 later, or towards (7, 5) to try and intercept me.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 7), the next planned move would be RIGHT again to (2, 7). This path rapidly approaches (7, 5).\n\nIf the enemy moves towards (7, 5): they might move UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3). If they move to (8, 4), I still have a significant distance advantage to (7, 5) compared to them IF they are heading for (9, 1).\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to (1, 7).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRationale for Turn 9:\nMy previous move was RIGHT to (1, 7). Last move information shows I arrived at (3, 7) from (2, 7) by moving RIGHT, meaning I moved RIGHT twice more, which implies my rationale for T10 and T11 must have been RIGHT as well, rather than the single move shown in the previous rationale block.\n\nRevisiting context: The provided block below \"Your last move information\" is the *result* of the previous turn's calculation.\nLast move was $\\mathbf{RIGHT}$ (T8). New Head is $\\mathbf{(1, 7)}$.\nThe rationale shown below the separator is for T8, which resulted in the move that put me at (1, 7).\n\nThe *current* turn information shows my Head is $\\mathbf{(3, 7)}$ and my last move was $\\mathbf{RIGHT}$. This means turns T9 and T10 were implicitly RIGHT moves, or the provided history is slightly misaligned with the standard display structure, but reflects the current state resulting from sequential RIGHT moves until T9 landed at (3, 7).\n\nAssuming the current state (Head at (3, 7)) is correct, and given the analysis that (7, 5) is likely already taken by Snake 0 (who was faster to get there from (8, 3)), the strategy must be to pivot towards the safer, distant apple (9, 1).\n\n**1. Analyze Possible Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (3, 7))**\nBody check: Head(3, 7) -> (2, 7).\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 7))**: Illegal (backwards).\n*   **UP (to (3, 8))**: Safe. Moves away from the lower quadrant where the action was.\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 6))**: Safe. Moves marginally towards Y=1, but RIGHT priority remains higher.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 7))**: Safe. Continues the progress towards X=9 for the (9, 1) target.\n\n**2. Enemy State Check (Estimated)**\nIf Snake 0 ate (7, 5) on T11 (based on my estimated T8-T11 trace), Snake 0 is now length 4, and their head is at (7, 5).\nSnake 0 options from (7, 5): U(7, 6), D(7, 4), L(6, 5), R(8, 5). They are unlikely to rush towards (3, 7) or (4, 7) quickly if moving randomly or covering space.\n\n**3. Target Selection**\nTarget A2=(9, 1). Current X=3, Y=7. Need 6 Right, 6 Down moves minimum (12 total steps).\n\nMoving RIGHT continues the best strategy to reach X=9 efficiently.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to (4, 7). This maintains momentum towards the safe apple (9, 1).\nRIGHT",
