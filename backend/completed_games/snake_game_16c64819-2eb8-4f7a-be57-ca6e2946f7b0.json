This will take me to (7, 4) and create some distance from the enemy snake #1. I will assess the situation and determine if it is safe to move diagonally down and to the left to eat the apple at (0, 8). If not, I will look for alternative moves to avoid colliding with the enemy snake.\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nAfter moving down, I see that the enemy snake #1 has moved down as well and its body still extends from (5, 7) to (8, 6). I do not see any immediate threats of colliding with the enemy snake if I move diagonally down and to the left. Therefore, I will proceed with this plan and move diagonally down and to the left to eat the apple at (0, 8).\n\nMy next move: DOWN and LEFT. This will take me to (6, 5) and then (5, 6), where I will eat the apple at (0, 8) and grow in length. I will then reassess the situation and determine my next move based on the new board state.\n\n--End of my turn response.--"
