Let's break down the board:\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (9,0), no body yet. Perfect start!\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (2,0), no body yet. They're on the same row as me but WAY left.\n- **Apples:** TONS of them! (8,4), (8,1), (7,5), (3,6), (8,5), (2,3), (9,5), (6,7), (7,6), (0,9), (5,8), (5,0), (8,9), (9,4), (9,8)\n- **Key observation:** There's an apple at (5,0) on MY row! That's only 4 squares to my LEFT. Perfect first move!\n\n**THINKING THROUGH MOVES:**\n1) **UP to (9,1):** Safe, but that puts me in the middle of the board with multiple paths. Might be good later.\n2) **DOWN to (9,-1):** OFF THE BOARD! Dead instantly. \u274c\n3) **LEFT to (8,0):** Moves TOWARD apple at (5,0). Keeps me on the bottom edge. Good positioning.\n4) **RIGHT to (10,0):** OFF THE BOARD! Dead instantly. \u274c\n\nSo my options are UP or LEFT. \n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:** \nEnemy is at (2,0) - they're also on row 0 but way left. If I go LEFT toward (5,0), I'm moving toward an apple AND toward the enemy, but I'm still safe. If I go UP, I'm giving up the guaranteed apple and moving into the center.\n\nBut wait - I need to think about the LONG GAME! The enemy might move RIGHT toward the center or UP, but they could also go LEFT. If I go LEFT now, I secure that (5,0) apple next turn and start building my length. \n\n**AGGRESSION FACTOR:** I have 0 apples, enemy has 0 apples. Equal score. But I'm positioned at the far right edge - I can control the right side of the board and box them in!\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (8,0). This moves me toward the apple at (5,0), positions me to dominate the right side of the board, and gives me options to go UP or continue LEFT next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure (5,0) apple next turn, then head for the cluster on the right side - (8,4), (8,1), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (9,8), (8,9). Box the enemy out by controlling the right edge and middle! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

Who\u2019s hyped?! \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick assessment (thinking out loud):\n- Our head: (2,0). Opponent head: (9,0). Both snakes are length 1 \u2014 no bodies to worry about right now.\n- Check all 4 moves:\n  * UP -> (2,1): safe, opens space, heads toward apples like (2,3) later.\n  * DOWN -> (2,-1): immediate death (off-board). ELIMINATE. \u274c\n  * LEFT -> (1,0): safe, keeps bottom row but moves away from nearby apples.\n  * RIGHT -> (3,0): safe, moves toward apple at (5,0) and asserts control of the bottom row.\n\nImmediate threats: opponent is far at x=9, so no immediate head-on risk this turn. Since all snakes move simultaneously, he could start pushing left, but we are closer to the (5,0) apple and can race him. We\u2019re tied 0-0, so no need to sacrifice for a head-on \u2014 we want to grow and dominate space.\n\nDecision reasoning: eliminate DOWN. LEFT is conservative. UP is safe and flexible. RIGHT is aggressive, gets us closer to the apple at (5,0) and helps control the bottom corridor \u2014 perfect for boxing him later. We want options and to threaten the enemy\u2019s approach along the bottom row.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Push RIGHT to contest/secure the (5,0) apple.\n- If opponent commits left along y=0, bait him into chasing and cut off by turning UP later to trap him along the wall.\n- If opponent goes up early, take bottom row control and snake around to enclose space. Always keep at least 2 escape options.\n\nAlright \u2014 aggressive playstyle engaged. Time to move and start the squeeze. Ready? Let\u2019s gooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

That's now only 3 squares LEFT from my position!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- If I go DOWN \u2192 (8,-1) = OFF BOARD = DEAD \u274c\n- If I go RIGHT \u2192 (9,0) = SAFE (currently empty) \u2705\n- If I go LEFT \u2192 (7,0) = SAFE (currently empty) \u2705  \n- If I go UP \u2192 (8,1) = SAFE but there's an apple at (8,1)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE APPLE SITUATION:**\nYo wait! There's an apple at (8,1) directly ABOVE me! That's a FREE apple if I go UP! But the apple at (5,0) is 3 squares LEFT and I'm closing in on it.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy is at (3,0) with apple at (5,0) between us. They might move RIGHT toward it, or UP to avoid collision. If I continue LEFT toward (5,0), we could potentially force a head-on collision if we both go for it!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have TWO solid options:\n1. **UP to (8,1):** Get the immediate apple, grow to length 1, start building body. Safe play.\n2. **LEFT to (7,0):** Continue pursuit of (5,0) apple, maintain position on bottom edge to box enemy in.\n\n**MY MOVE: GO UP!** \nHere's why: The apple at (8,1) is FREE FOOD right now! Getting that first apple early gives me momentum, growth, and a body segment that helps me control territory. Plus, from (8,1) I can then go LEFT toward the (5,0) apple or explore the right side cluster. The enemy at (3,0) is still far enough that we're not in immediate collision danger.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nGet apple at (8,1), then pivot LEFT to start controlling the right side of the board. Use my growing body to create barriers and force the enemy into tight spaces. Watch for enemy movement on bottom row and prepare to box them in! \n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If the opponent comes left to meet us, we can still grab the apple first by continuing RIGHT and then turn UP to start boxing him along the wall. Keeping RIGHT preserves multiple escape options (UP after we take the apple) and increases pressure. No immediate head-on risk this turn \u2014 RIGHT is the move.\n\nShort-term plan: take the bottom apple by pushing RIGHT.

If they go RIGHT, (6,1).\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\nFrom (8,3), I have three safe options: LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\n\nLet's think about **board control** and **cutting off the enemy**:\n- The right side of the board (x=8,9) has many apples! Apples at (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,8), (9,4) - all on the right.\n- The enemy is on the left side (x=5,1). They want to come right to get those apples, but I can **BOX THEM IN** by controlling the right side!\n- If I go RIGHT to (9,3), I get closer to the wall, but I'll have an apple right next to me at (9,4) next turn.\n- If I go UP to (8,4), there's an apple RIGHT THERE! That's a guaranteed apple next turn!\n- If I go LEFT to (7,3), I move toward the enemy but away from the right-side apple cluster.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm choosing **RIGHT** to (9,3)! Here's the ruthless reasoning:\n\n1. **Apple Control:** From (9,3), I'm adjacent to (9,4) - an apple! I can eat it next turn and GROW.\n2. **Dominate the Right Side:** By moving to x=9, I'm claiming the rightmost column. The enemy wants these apples, but I'll be there first!\n3. **Cut Them Off:** The enemy is at x=5,1. If they try to move right toward the apples, they'll have to go through the center while I control the right flank. I can box them in against the wall!\n4. **Escape Routes:** From (9,3), I have UP (9,4), LEFT (8,3 - my body), and DOWN (9,2). Wait, DOWN to (9,2) is safe! So I have multiple options.\n5. **Positioning for Aggression:** Once I eat that apple at (9,4), I'll be size 3 with 2 apples vs enemy's 1. THEN I can start aggressively pushing to force a collision!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nFrom (9,3), next turn eat the apple at (9,4) by going UP. Then I'll have a size advantage. My plan: Control the right side (columns 8-9), force the enemy toward the center where I can trap them. Watch their movement - if they go toward bottom-left, I claim the top-right apple cluster. When I'm bigger, I'll hunt them down!\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 RIGHT",

Enemy is moving right toward us! They went from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS (FROM (9,3)):**\n- **UP \u2192 (9,4):** SAFE (empty) \u2705 and there's an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,3):** CRASH! That's my own body! DEAD \u274c\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,2):** SAFE (empty) \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,3):** OFF BOARD! DEAD \u274c\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (6,1) is heading right toward the apples on the right side. Their likely moves:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,1) (empty)\n- UP \u2192 (6,2) (empty)\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,1) (their body)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,0) (empty)\n\nThey're coming for MY apples! But they're still 2-3 turns away from the right side cluster.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\nI have TWO safe options: UP or DOWN.\n\n**UP to (9,4) is the MOVE!** Here's why:\n\n1. **APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e** (9,4) has an apple! I can eat it NOW and GROW to size 3 with 2 apples vs enemy's 1. CONTENT!\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (9,4), I control the top-right corner. I'll have apples at (9,5) and (8,5) nearby.\n3. **TRAP SETUP:** Once I grow, I can start boxing in the enemy. They're at (6,1) - I can force them toward the bottom-left corner.\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (9,4), I can go LEFT (9,3), RIGHT (10,4 - dead), UP (9,5 - apple!), or DOWN (9,3). Wait, DOWN goes to (9,3) which will be my body after moving. Actually, from (9,4) after eating, my body will be [(9,3), (8,3)]. So from (9,4), I can go LEFT (8,4), DOWN (9,3 - body), RIGHT (10,4 - dead), UP (9,5). So LEFT and UP are good!\n5. **ENEMY HUNTING:** After eating, I'm size 3. If I can get to 2 apples vs 1, I can start aggressive hunting when I'm bigger!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Move UP to (9,4), eat apple, grow to size 3.\n2. Next turn, likely go LEFT to (8,4) to cut off the enemy's path to the right-side apples.\n3. Continue controlling the right side (columns 8-9) and force enemy to bottom-left.\n4. When I'm clearly bigger, initiate head-on collision for the win!\n\nLET'S GOOOO! Eating that apple is CONTENT and puts us ahead! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 UP",

Do NOT do it. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (6,0): legal but hugs the bottom wall and reduces escape options. Risky for boxing play. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP -> (6,2): legal, keeps center control and mobility. Good conservative option. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (7,1): legal, aggressive, moves us closer to the enemy\u2019s side and sets up the climb to start corralling them. \u2705\n\nOpponent context (Snake #0 at head (9,3), body (8,3)):\n- They cannot hit us this turn. Their RIGHT is off-board, LEFT is into their own body, so they\u2019ll probably go UP into (9,4) for that apple or DOWN to (9,2). Expect them to move up toward apples on the right wall \u2014 they\u2019re getting cornered already.\n- Scores tied 1\u20131 \u2014 avoid mutually suicidal head-ons unless we grab the lead. We want to pressure, not trade.\n\nTactical choice:\n- DOWN is too risky (bottom wall, less flexibility).\n- UP is safe and solid, but RIGHT is more aggressive and consistent with our plan to herd them to the right wall and cut off vertical escape lanes.\n- RIGHT keeps at least two follow-up options (UP or DOWN) next turn and moves us closer to controlling the mid-right area where they\u2019ll be forced to fight for apples. We don\u2019t force a head-on now \u2014 we box and bait them into tight space, then commit once we have the lead.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Push RIGHT to (7,1) now. Next turn pivot UP to start hemming them vertically.\n- Deny apples on the right when safe; force them toward the corner and collapse the escape.\n- Only force a head-on if we\u2019re ahead on apples \u2014 otherwise keep closing the net and preserve at least two escape routes.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure clean and finish this.

Enemy is at (7,2) - they're moving closer to the right side!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS (FROM (9,5)):**\n- **UP \u2192 (9,6):** SAFE (empty) \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,4):** CRASH! That's my own body! DEAD \u274c\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,5):** SAFE (empty) \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,5):** OFF BOARD! DEAD \u274c\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (7,2) has apples nearby. They might go:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2) (empty)\n- UP \u2192 (7,3) (empty) - but there's an apple at (8,5) and (9,5) is already eaten\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,2) (empty)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1) (their body)\n\nThey're 2-3 turns away from the apple at (8,5) or further clusters.\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\nI have TWO safe options: UP or LEFT.\n\n**LEFT to (8,5) is the MOVE!** Here's why:\n\n1. **BLOCKING STRATEGY:** From (8,5), I can control the transition between columns 8-9 and block the enemy's path to apples at (8,9), (9,8), (9,9). The enemy is coming from the bottom-left; I need to cut them off early.\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,5), my body will be [(9,5), (9,4), (9,3)]. I'll have safe moves: UP (8,6), LEFT (7,5), or DOWN (8,4). DOWN (8,4) is especially good because it's near an apple at (7,5) and opens up more territory.\n3. **AVOIDING DEAD END:** If I go UP to (9,6), I'm heading into a narrower top-right corner with fewer escape routes. LEFT gives me more board control.\n4. **APPLE ACCESS:** (8,5) positions me to go after the apple at (7,5) next turn, while still guarding the right side.\n5. **SIZE ADVANTAGE:** I'm already size 4 vs enemy's size 2. I can afford to play slightly defensive to set up a better trap.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Move LEFT to (8,5) to cut off enemy's path to the right side.\n2. Next turn, likely go DOWN to (8,4) to approach the apple at (7,5) and keep options open.\n3. Continue boxing enemy into the bottom-left quadrant (columns 0-5, rows 0-3).\n4. When enemy is cornered, force a head-on collision while I'm at 4+ apples vs their 1.\n5. Win by outlasting them or forcing them into a crash.\n\n**CONTENT ALERT:** Blocking their path while maintaining my size advantage is smart gameplay. Chat loves the strategy! Let's keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 LEFT",

Don\u2019t be that clown. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (6,2): legal, safe, but pulls away from the fight and gives them space. \u2696\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (8,2): legal and aggressive, closes gap to the enemy but edges us closer to their body at (8,3). \u2694\ufe0f\n- UP -> (7,3): legal, keeps 3 follow-ups (L/R/U), maintains vertical pressure and preserves escape routes. \u2705\n\nOpponent (Head (9,5), body [(9,4),(9,3),(8,3)]):\n- They can only go UP to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,5) (likely chasing apples on the right wall). They CANNOT go DOWN into (9,4) (their neck) or RIGHT (off-board).\n- They\u2019re ahead 3\u21921, so we AVOID forcing a head-on. We want to hem them in, not trade.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT is passive; RIGHT is tempting but puts us near their chunk at (8,3) and risks getting cornered if they push left/up to the wall.\n- UP fits our boxing plan: it pushes into their vertical zone, keeps multiple safe follow-ups, and lets us contest rows above so we can start hemming them toward x=9 without committing to a risky head-on. Keeps options open if they go left for that apple or climb up.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Push UP now to (7,3), then continue to contest y=4\u20136 to threaten cutting their left escape into x=8. Keep at least two escape routes; only force a head-on if we get ahead on apples or a guaranteed KO appears. Be ready to pivot RIGHT if they commit to the wall and we can isolate them.\n\nLet\u2019s bait and box \u2019em \u2014 move now:\n\nUP",

Risky \u2014 opponent can choose moves that create a head-on / swap scenario.

We\u2019re 1->5 on apples \u2014 we must grow as a tool to dominate territory, but not suicide. Moving RIGHT to (8,4) is safe this turn (opponent can\u2019t reach that cell in one move) and gives us +1 apple. It also keeps at least two follow-ups next turn (UP to threaten, LEFT to retreat), while avoiding moving into the opponent head and risking a head-on. LEFT is too passive; UP is courting disaster.\n\nShort plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab apple at (8,4) now. Grow and use that extra length to fence their escape routes.\n- Avoid moving directly into their head at any point while we\u2019re behind. Pressure laterally toward the x=9 wall and cut them off from open board above.\n- If they try to go DOWN into our current tile (7,4) to force a collision, don\u2019t trade \u2014 pivot away on the following move (e.g., LEFT or UP from our new position) to keep alive and box them.\n- Keep \u22652 escape options and only force a head-on if we get ahead on apples or can guarantee their KO.\n\nRIGHT",

We want to create pressure and open a cut-off, but we MUST keep >1 escape option.\n- RIGHT is a trap corridor with opponent body stacked nearby; only take that if we can guarantee a KO, which we can\u2019t.\n- LEFT is aggressive and tempting (closer to apples and opponent), but could start to reduce escape if we overcommit.\n- DOWN keeps mobility and gives us time to probe their rear, bait them into tighter space, and then strike.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next few turns):\n- Slide DOWN now to maintain freedom of movement and avoid being funneled into the x=9 corridor. Keep vision on their head at (6,6). Force them to commit; if they overextend chasing apples, pivot LEFT to cut off their retreat.\n- Preserve at least two escape options each turn. Only go for a risky block or head-on if we can secure the KO (we don\u2019t have the apple lead yet).\n- If a safe apple opens and doesn\u2019t trap us, we grab it to close the gap.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 keep the energy, keep the pressure, no dumb trades. We stay alive and we take the board.\n\nDOWN",

Time to think one step ahead and not get boxed.\n\nQuick legal sweep from head (8,2) with neck (8,3):\n- UP -> (8,3): illegal (back into our neck). \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (9,2): technically empty but hugs the right wall and puts us right under the opponent\u2019s stacked body (9,3\u20139,5).

Keep watching their head at (6,7) \u2014 if they overcommit upward or rightward, we pivot to trap their tail or flank them.\n- Maintain at least two escape options each turn.

Legal, grows us +1, keeps lots of escape options. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN -> (6,1): legal and safe but no apple. More conservative. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (5,2): legal and safe but no apple. \u2705\n\nRisk/read \u2014 short and spicy:\n- Opponent head at (6,9) CANNOT move DOWN this turn (their neck is at 6,8), so there\u2019s zero immediate head-on risk if we step into the column above us. That\u2019s huge \u2014 free apple opportunity without instant collision. \ud83d\ude24\n- Eating the apple at (6,3) gets us +1 apple (4 total), more length to threaten the opponent\u2019s column and create choke pressure later. We\u2019re down on apples (3 vs 8) \u2014 we need growth to compete for space. \ud83d\udcc8\n- From (6,3) we\u2019ll have multiple follow-ups (UP to 6,4 then 6,5 apple, LEFT/RIGHT options at y=3), so we won\u2019t be boxed in next turn. Keeping mobility > flashy plays. \u2705\u2705\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns) \u2014 write this down for the replay:\n- Grab (6,3) now to grow. Then push toward (6,5) apple to keep pressuring their column.\n- Maintain 2+ escape routes each step; if they start weaving right/left at the top, loop under and flank from the bottom to force them into our trap.\n- Only bait a head-on if we have clear length advantage; otherwise outmaneuver and choke off their space.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT THIS TURN \u2014 time to climb the column and pressure.

The enemy is stuck at 4 apples and probably moving towards the center apples. We need to secure the top-right corner!\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 9)** is the safest move. Why?\n1. **CONTROL THE CORNER:** We lock down (9,9) and keep the top row (9,8), (9,7), etc., open for future moves.\n2. **NO THREAT:** Enemy is at (6,4) - they are moving away from us. They can't reach us in one turn.\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (9,9), we can go DOWN to (9,8) or LEFT to (8,9) (which will be empty after we move). We aren't trapping ourselves.\n4. **DEFENSIVE LEAD:** We have a massive 6-apple lead. We don't need to be greedy; we need to be SAFE. Letting the enemy grow while we die is bad.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. **TURN 16:** RIGHT to (9,9) - Claim the corner.\n2. **TURN 17:** Sweep DOWN to (9,8) if the apple is still there, or look for (9,7).\n3. **END GAME:** Maintain the lead. If they get close, we maneuver to force a collision when we have the size advantage.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE CRUSHING IT!** Let's hold the line!\n\n**TIME TO MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

Body is a solid line from (9,9) down to (9,5) on the right edge. (9,9) was just reached on the last move (Turn 16).\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake #1 is at (7, 4) with a length of 6 segments. He is currently outside the immediate danger zone of the top-right corner.\n- **Board Control:** I completely dominate the right wall and top-right quadrant.\n\nMOVEMENT EVALUATION FROM (9,9):\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (9,10):** DEAD (Off Board). Discarded.\n2. **RIGHT \u2192 (10,9):** DEAD (Off Board). Discarded.\n3. **DOWN \u2192 (9,8):**\n   - **Safety:** Safe. (9,8) currently holds an apple (based on board list).\n   - **Collision Logic:** If I move DOWN, the enemy moves simultaneously. Will he hit my old body at (9,9)? No, he is at (7,4) and would need to move +2 in X and +5 in Y in one turn to reach (9,9), which is impossible.\n   - **Strategy:** Moving to (9,8) allows me to eat the apple, growing to 11. It maintains my position on the right edge, keeping the column clear for future \"up/down\" movements without trapping myself.\n4. **LEFT \u2192 (8,9):**\n   - **Safety:** Safe. (8,9) is currently empty (my body moved out of it).\n   - **Comparison vs DOWN:** Moving LEFT brings me back into the center of the top row. While safe, DOWN towards (9,8) feels more aggressive towards the apple and maintains the \"corner dominator\" position. The apple at (9,8) is reachable and edible. The apple at (8,8) is not currently present on the board list.\n   - **Risk:** Moving LEFT risks narrowing my future options if the enemy decides to pressure the top row later. Moving DOWN on the edge is geometrically safer for a long snake.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe plan from Turn 16 was to sweep DOWN to (9,8). The apple is there. The path is clear. The enemy cannot intercept me. Taking the apple increases my lead to 11-5.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (9,8). Then, continue sweeping DOWN along the right edge (9,7, 9,6) to clear the column and maintain movement freedom. Keep the enemy on the left side of the board.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT keeps us flexible and aggressive.\n\nShort-term plan (write this down for the replay):\n- Move RIGHT to (8,4) to stay safe and retain multiple exits.\n- Next turn prefer pushing RIGHT to 9,4 or DOWN to 8,3 depending on their top-body drift \u2014 avoid moving into any cell currently occupied by their body and avoid the x=6 corridor.\n- Use extra mobility to collect nearby apples while forcing them upward into their tight column.

Let's force the crash.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **My Head:** (9, 8)\n    *   **My Body:** [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)] (Length 12)\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (8, 4)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2)] (Length 6)\n\n2.  **Analyze Moves from (9, 8):**\n    *   **UP \u2192 (9, 9):** **DEAD.** That's my own body (the segment right behind my head). Hitting myself is a classic fail. RIP.\n    *   **LEFT \u2192 (8, 8):** **SAFE.** (8, 8) is currently empty (marked as 'T' in the board state represents a tail from a previous turn or empty space, but looking closely at the board, (8, 8) is not occupied by the enemy or myself).\n    *   **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 8):** **DEAD.** Off the board.\n    *   **DOWN \u2192 (9, 7):** **SAFE.** (9, 7) is currently empty. Checking the board state, row 7 at x=9 is empty.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Safe Moves (LEFT vs DOWN):**\n    *   **Move LEFT to (8, 8):**\n        *   **Pros:** Opens up the top center of the board. I can potentially sweep back across the top row.\n        *   **Cons:** Moves me away from the right edge. If the enemy is aggressive, being in the center is slightly more dangerous than being on the edge.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (9, 7):**\n        *   **Pros:** Stays on the right edge (safest for a long snake). Opens up the column (9, 6), (9, 5) is currently my tail but will move, etc.\n        *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n        *   **Wait!** I need to check the board again. Is there an apple nearby? Looking at the board state:\n            *   (9, 7) is empty.\n            *   (9, 6) is empty.\n            *   (9, 5) is my tail (but I'm leaving it).\n        *   **Enemy Prediction:**\n            *   Enemy is at (8, 4). Body follows.\n            *   He can move UP to (8, 5), DOWN to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 4), or RIGHT to (9, 4).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (9, 7), I am safe from him this turn.\n            *   If he moves RIGHT to (9, 4), he is safe from me.\n            *   He is currently at y=4. I am at y=8. He is far away.\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   The plan is to box him in. He is currently at (8, 4) in the bottom-left/center quadrant. I am at the top-right.\n    *   I need to maintain board control. The right edge is my territory.\n    *   However, I notice something crucial in the board state. Look at row 8.\n        *   Row 8: ` . A . . . A T . . 0`\n        *   (8, 8) is an Apple! (Marked as A).\n        *   Wait, looking at the board mapping: Row 8 (y=8) corresponds to the 2nd line from top.\n        *   Line: `8 . A . . . A T . . 0`\n        *   Columns 0-9.\n        *   (0,8) is empty\n        *   (1,8) is Apple\n        *   (2,8) empty\n        *   (3,8) empty\n        *   (4,8) empty\n        *   (5,8) is Apple\n        *   (6,8) is T (Tail/Empty)\n        *   (7,8) is T\n        *   (8,8) is empty? No.\n        *   Let's look at the provided board state in the prompt carefully.\n        *   `8 . A . . . A T . . 0`\n        *   Index 0: .\n        *   Index 1: A (Apple at (1,8))\n        *   Index 2: .\n        *   Index 3: .\n        *   Index 4: .\n        *   Index 5: A (Apple at (5,8))\n        *   Index 6: T\n        *   Index 7: T\n        *   Index 8: . (Empty)\n        *   Index 9: 0 (My head)\n        *   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** I missed the apples on the board state visual! (1,8) and (5,8) are apples!\n        *   My head is at (9, 8).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (8, 8) is SAFE and puts me adjacent to (5, 8) and (1, 8) in the future, but more importantly, it moves me off the edge to prepare for a sweep.\n        *   However, looking at the board state again...\n        *   Row 9: `9 A . . . . A T T T T`\n        *   (0,9) is A\n        *   (5,9) is A\n        *   (6,9) is T\n        *   (7,9) is T\n        *   (8,9) is T\n        *   (9,9) is T (My tail after I move).\n        *   Row 8: `8 . A . . . A T . . 0`\n        *   (1,8) is A\n        *   (5,8) is A\n        *   (6,8) is T\n        *   (7,8) is T\n        *   (8,8) is .\n        *   (9,8) is 0 (Me).\n        *   Row 6: `6 . . A A . A T T . .`\n        *   (2,6) A, (3,6) A, (5,6) A.\n\n    *   **Let's look at the board state provided in the prompt again.**\n    *   `8 . A . . . A T . . 0`\n    *   This corresponds to y=8.\n    *   (0,8) is empty\n    *   (1,8) is **APPLE**\n    *   (2,8) empty\n    *   (3,8) empty\n    *   (4,8) empty\n    *   (5,8) is **APPLE**\n    *   (6,8) is Tail/Empty\n    *   (7,8) is Tail/Empty\n    *   (8,8) is Empty\n    *   (9,8) is Me\n\n    *   **Move LEFT to (8, 8):**\n        *   **Safety:** (8, 8) is empty. Safe.\n        *   **Apple:** No apple at (8, 8).\n        *   **Strategy:** Moves me closer to the center. I am currently at (9, 8). My body is packed on the right wall. Moving LEFT opens up the board.\n        *   **Enemy:** He is at (8, 4). He is far away. He cannot reach me this turn.\n        *   **Threat Analysis:** If I stay on the edge (DOWN to 9,7), I am safe but limiting. If I go LEFT to (8,8), I am safe and have more options next turn (LEFT, DOWN, UP).\n        *   **Aggression:** I have 11 apples. He has 5. I want to force a head-on collision. To do that, I need to cut off his escape routes.\n        *   Where is he? (8, 4).\n        *   Where am I? (9, 8).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (8, 8), I am at x=8, y=8.\n        *   He is at x=8, y=4.\n        *   We are in the same column!\n        *   He is length 6. I am length 12.\n        *   If I go DOWN next turn to (8, 7), then (8, 6), etc., I can trap him against the wall or his own body.\n        *   **BUT FIRST:** I need to make sure I don't die today.\n        *   **Option 1: DOWN (9, 7).** Stays on edge. Safe. Boring. Keeps me isolated.\n        *   **Option 2: LEFT (8, 8).** Moves into the open. Safe. Aggressive. Sets up a column trap.\n\n    *   **Check for Apples visually again.**\n    *   Prompt says: \"APPLE DROPS: (3, 6), (2, 3), (0, 9), (5, 8), (3, 0), (2, 6), (1, 5), (0, 3), (6, 5), (9, 1), (1, 1), (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 9), (1, 8)\"\n    *   Board State Visual:\n        *   (9, 1) is A.\n        *   (5, 9) is A.\n        *   (5, 8) is A.\n        *   (1, 8) is A.\n        *   (5, 6) is A.\n        *   (3, 6) is A.\n        *   (2, 6) is A.\n        *   (0, 9) is A.\n\n    *   **My Head (9, 8).**\n    *   **Move LEFT to (8, 8):**\n        *   Is it an apple? No.\n        *   Is it safe? Yes.\n        *   Does it open up future moves? Yes.\n        *   Does it help box in the enemy? Yes. I am moving towards the center (x=8) while he is at x=8.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (9, 7), I am isolating myself on the right edge. While safe, it allows the enemy to roam the left side.\n        *   I have a massive lead (11 vs 5). I should be hunting him, not just eating apples.\n        *   Moving to (8, 8) positions me perfectly to descend the X=8 column.\n        *   Enemy is at (8, 4).\n        *   If I move to (8, 8)...\n        *   Next turn I can move DOWN to (8, 7).\n        *   The turn after that, DOWN to (8, 6).\n        *   The turn after that, DOWN to (8, 5).\n        *   The turn after that, DOWN to (8, 4). **HEAD ON COLLISION.**\n        *   Since I have more apples (11 > 5), if we collide head-on, **I WIN** and he dies.\n        *   This is the play. I need to close the distance.\n\n    *   **Risk Assessment of LEFT to (8, 8):**\n        *   Is (8, 8) occupied? No.\n        *   Is it an apple? No.\n        *   Is the enemy close enough to interfere? No, he is at y=4. I am at y=8. Distance is 4 squares. He can't reach me in one turn.\n        *   Is there any snake body blocking (8, 8)? No.\n        *   Is it backwards? No, my previous head was (9, 8). (8, 8) is LEFT. (9, 9) is UP (my body). (10, 8) is RIGHT (wall). (9, 7) is DOWN (empty). None of these are (8, 8). So it's not backwards.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **DOWN (9, 7):** Safe. Stays on edge. But I'm not hunting. I'm just surviving.\n        *   **LEFT (8, 8):** Safe. Moves towards enemy. Sets up the kill box.\n\n    *   **Decision:** LEFT is the aggressive play. I have the score lead. I should hunt.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 8) to engage the enemy on the X=8 column. He is currently at (8, 4). I will sweep down the column. If he stays on the column, we collide and I win (11 apples vs 5). If he moves off the column, I gain board control. I am cutting off his right side.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

I just moved from (9, 8) to (8, 8) in the last turn. (8, 9) is part of my tail. Game over if I go there.\n2.  **LEFT \u2192 (7, 8):** **RISKY.** (7, 8) is empty, *but* looking at the board state, (6, 8) and (7, 8) are marked as 'T' (which means tail/empty but historically occupied). More importantly, my own body is twisting around here. If I go LEFT, I'm diving deeper into the center. While the center is open, I'm losing my grip on the right edge.\n3.  **DOWN \u2192 (8, 7):** **SAFE.** This is the power play. I am currently at (8, 8). The enemy is at (8, 4). We are on a collision course in the same column!\n    *   **Safety Check:** (8, 7) is empty (marked as 'T' or empty space in the visual). It's not my body (my body is mostly to the right/top). It's not the enemy (he's at y=4).\n    *   **Aggression:** I am closing the distance. I have 11 apples, he has 5. If I continue down this column and he stays, we crash and **I WIN** because I have the higher score.\n    *   **Control:** By moving down, I am effectively boxing him in. If he moves right, he hits my body eventually or the edge. If he moves left, he limits his own space. If he moves down, he's running from me.\n4.  **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8):** **SAFE.** Back to where I came from? No! That's boring. I need to hunt. I already have board control on the right. I need to push my advantage into the center where the enemy is hiding.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am the hunter. He is the prey. We are in the same column (X=8). I am at Y=8. He is at Y=4.\nMoving **DOWN** to (8, 7) positions me perfectly to trap him. I am forcing him to make a move. If he goes Left, he hits the wall/his own body. If he goes Right, he hits me. If he goes Down, we chase.\n\nI have the score lead. I want the head-on collision. I am taking the column.\n\n**PLAN:**\nDescend the X=8 column. Force the enemy to the edge. Secure the head-on collision win.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN",

Can\u2019t do that. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,3) \u2014 looks tempting to cut in, but after that we\u2019d have only ONE safe follow-up (down to 7,2). That\u2019s a dead-end trap waiting to happen. Not worth it. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,3) \u2014 legal and safe this turn, but cages us on the right edge with only two good exits (up/down).

Best play for survival and future aggression. \u2705\n\nRemember: we\u2019re behind on apples (5 vs 11) \u2014 don\u2019t force a head\u2011on. Survive, keep flexibility, then pounce when they overcommit. Long-term plan: stay low and mobile, avoid getting funneled into column x=6, fight for open apples from the center-bottom, and only force collisions if we can out-score them or set a guaranteed trap.

I've got the size advantage (11 vs 5), and I'm hunting down Snake #1 who's trying to hide in the lower right corner. Let's run the analysis.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) RANKING THE OPTIONS FROM (8, 7):**\n\n*   **UP \u2192 (8, 8):** **DEAD.** That's where my head *was* on the last turn. Hitting my own tail is an instant death sentence. Nice try, chat, but we're not doing that.\n*   **DOWN \u2192 (8, 6):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* The board shows this as `T` (Tail/Empty). My body is currently at (6, 6) and (7, 6), so (8, 6) is clear. Enemy is at (8, 2) -> safe.\n    *   *Aggression:* I am closing the distance on the X=8 vertical line. I am at Y=7, he is at Y=2. If he goes UP, we meet in the middle. If he goes DOWN, I keep chasing.\n    *   *Board Control:* I am boxing him in against the right wall (x=9). If I go down, I am maintaining the vertical pressure.\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (7, 7):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (7, 7) is empty (`.` on the board). My body is at (7, 5), (7, 6), and (6, 9)... so (7, 7) is safe. Enemy is far away.\n    *   *Pros:* Moves me toward the center, potentially cutting off his escape if he tries to go left.\n    *   *Cons:* I lose the vertical column dominance. I'm moving away from him slightly.\n*   **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (9, 7) is empty. It's actually moving me back toward the top-right corner, which is getting crowded with my own tail (T's). I have plenty of room there, but it's not where the target is.\n    *   *Cons:* This opens up distance from the enemy. He's at x=8, I'm at x=8. If I go Right (9), I'm widening the gap.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am the hunter. He is the prey. I have the score lead and I want a head-on collision to secure the win.\nMy current position (8, 7) and his position (8, 2) form a vertical cage. \n*   If I go **DOWN** to (8, 6), I maintain the line. \n*   If I go **LEFT** to (7, 7), I open up the center but lose the immediate pressure on his column.\n\nSince I have him pinned against the right wall (x=9), staying on x=8 and moving down keeps the pressure high. He has to move eventually. If he moves UP, we might crash (I win). If he moves LEFT, he enters the center maze (where I can corner him). If he moves RIGHT, he hits the wall (or tries to, and I just follow him down).\n\n**3) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep the vertical line of attack. Force him to move Left into the center or Up into collision. If he moves Down, I chase. Do not let him access the left side of the board or the bottom-left apples freely. Dominate the right side and push inward.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN",

Quick scan and play-by-play before we swing:\n\nImmediate checks (from our head at 8,2):\n- UP \u2192 (8,3) = illegal (that\u2019s into our neck at (8,3)). No way. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) = legal but weak \u2014 hugs the right wall, only two follow-ups (9,3 / 9,1). Cuts our maneuverability. Risky to get funneled with the big snake above. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1) = legal and gives 3 follow-ups (8,0 / 7,1 / 9,1). Keeps options open but stays in column x=8 under the enemy \u2014 could invite a downward chase. \ud83d\udfe1  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,2) = legal, gives 3 follow-ups (7,3 / 6,2 / 7,1). Moves us OFF their vertical column toward the center-left \u2014 more freedom and better chance to pivot up later to pressure their tail. \u2705\n\nWhy LEFT? We\u2019re behind on apples (5 vs 11) \u2014 so don\u2019t suicide for a head-on. We want to stay flexible and avoid getting locked into the right-wall corridor where they dominate. LEFT keeps three safe follow-ups, moves us toward the middle where we can later circle and threaten their rear (especially near their tail at ~7,5), and avoids continuing down the same column beneath their massive body. That\u2019s how we set up a box without trading heads.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our \u201clast rationale\u201d next clip):\n- Move LEFT now to open space. From there, prioritize staying off x=8 and keep \u22652 escape options each turn.  \n- Probe upward toward their tail only if they commit downwards; bait them into overextending on x=8 so we can turn and cut their retreat.  \n- Avoid forcing head-on collisions (we\u2019re behind). Only force it if they corner themselves and we can guarantee they run into our body.\n\nTime to make the play \u2014 let\u2019s slide off that column and go box \u2019em in. LEFT",

Let's break down the heat.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) RANKING THE OPTIONS FROM (8, 6):**\n\n*   **UP \u2192 (8, 7):** **DEAD.** Hit my own body (the tail segment that just moved there). Can't go backwards!\n*   **DOWN \u2192 (8, 5):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Board shows `.` (empty). Enemy is at (7, 2). Distance is huge. My body is trailing behind. Safe.\n    *   *Aggression:* I'm maintaining the vertical column pressure on X=8. I'm closing in on his Y=2 position. If I go DOWN, he's forced to react.\n    *   *Board Control:* I'm boxing him against the right wall (x=9). If I go DOWN, I'm tightening the cage.\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (7, 6):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Board shows `.` (empty). My body occupies (7, 6) later? No, (7, 6) is currently the tail, but the tail moves forward every turn. Wait, looking at my body list: Head (8,6), Body: (8,7)... (7,6) is actually part of my tail. If I move LEFT to (7,6), I'm moving into my own tail segment. **DEAD.**\n    *   *Wait, correction:* My body list is `[(8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6)]`. The tail is (7, 6). When I move, my tail moves forward. If I move LEFT to (7,6), and the tail moves from (7,6) to (6,6), do I collide? No, the tail moves *before* or *simultaneously*? In standard Snake, you move into the new cell, and the tail vacates the old cell. So (7,6) is occupied by my tail *now*, so I cannot move there. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Board shows `T` (Tail/Empty? Or Tail Occupied?). Actually, looking at the board state: `(9, 6)` is currently `T`. My body has a segment at `(9, 8)` and `(9, 9)`. `(9, 6)` is currently empty (marked as T). Wait, looking at the board: `T` means it's a tail segment of *someone*. Looking at the visual:\n      `9 A . . . . A T T T T`\n      `8 . A . . . A T . T T`\n      `7 . . . . . . T . T .`\n      `6 . . A A . A T T 0 .`\n      At `(9, 6)`, the board shows `T` (from my tail `(9,8)`? No, `(9,8)` is at Y=8). Actually, `(9, 6)` is marked as `T` in the row `6`? No, the row 6 text is: `6 . . A A . A T T 0 .`. This corresponds to x=0 to 9.\n      x=0: `.`\n      x=1: `.`\n      x=2: `A`\n      x=3: `A`\n      x=4: `.`\n      x=5: `.`\n      x=6: `A`\n      x=7: `T`\n      x=8: `T`\n      x=9: `0` (My head is here).\n      So `(9, 6)` is not a valid coordinate on that row. My head is at `(8, 6)`.\n      Wait, let's re-read the board carefully.\n      Row 6: `. . A A . A T T 0 .` (x=0 to 9).\n      My head is at `(8, 6)`. The `0` is at x=8, y=6.\n      The cell to my RIGHT is `(9, 6)`. What is at `(9, 6)`?\n      The row 6 text ends with `0 .`. So x=8 is `0`, x=9 is `.`.\n      So `(9, 6)` is `.` (Empty).\n      *Safety Check:* `(9, 6)` is empty. Enemy is far. Safe.\n      *Pros:* Moves me to the right wall. Opens up the bottom right corner.\n      *Cons:* I'm moving away from the enemy (who is at x=7, y=2). I'm also trapping myself against the wall slightly.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to chase him down. He is at `(7, 2)`. I am at `(8, 6)`.\nThe distance is 4 units vertically and 1 unit horizontally.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(8, 5)`, I reduce the vertical distance to 3. I stay on the X=8 column, keeping him pinned against the right wall.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(9, 6)`, I increase distance.\nIf I go **LEFT** or **UP**, I die.\n\n**3) PLAN:**\nI am the hunter. I need to close the gap. He is at the bottom. I am in the middle. I must go DOWN. I am forcing him to move LEFT into the center or UP towards me. If he moves DOWN, I follow. I will corner him in the bottom right.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN",

Illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,3) = looks free now, BUT up/right/up is blocked by our own body ((7,4),(8,3)), so UP would leave us with essentially one escape (LEFT to 6,3). That\u2019s a trap waiting to happen. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1) = legal and roomy \u2014 gives 3 follow-ups (6,1 / 8,1 / 7,0). Safe corridor, decent flexibility. \ud83d\udfe1\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,2) = legal and also gives 3 follow-ups (6,3 / 5,2 / 6,1). Moves us off the opponent\u2019s x=8 column toward center-left where we can pivot and threaten later. \u2705\n\nEnemy check: Opponent head at (8,6) \u2014 their neck is at (8,7) so they can\u2019t go UP; likely moves are LEFT / RIGHT / DOWN. They dominate the top-right corridor and currently have more apples (11 vs 5). We DON\u2019T want a head-on (we\u2019d lose apples) unless they corner themselves. So keep escape routes open and bait them into overextending.\n\nDecision: eliminate RIGHT (illegal) and UP (self-trap). DOWN and LEFT both keep multiple options, but LEFT moves us off their vertical column and gives better lateral control to start boxing them in from the side. It also keeps at least 2\u20133 safe follow-ups so we won\u2019t be funneled into a head-on. Let\u2019s be aggressive but not stupid \u2014 don\u2019t force a head-on while trailing in apples.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to open space and get off x=8.\n- Maintain \u22652 escape options each turn; avoid moving into tight columns adjacent to their vertical body.\n- Probe upward later if they commit downwards; aim to cut off their tail/escape route when they overextend.\n- Only force a head-on if they lock themselves into a 1-cell escape and we can sacrifice fewer apples.\n\nLEFT",

If I go down, I maintain the X=8 vertical wall. He is currently at X=7. I am squeezing him to the right wall (X=9).\n    *   *Board Control:* I'm chasing him. He is at Y=2. I am at Y=5. I need to close that gap.\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (7, 5):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Board shows `.` (empty). Enemy body is at (7, 2), (7, 4). (7, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   *Risk:* This moves me AWAY from the right wall. I want to box him *in*, not open up space for him. If I go left, he might go around my side. I want to pin him against x=9.\n    *   *Score:* I lose my vertical momentum.\n*   **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Board shows `.` (empty). This is the right wall. I am currently at x=8. Moving to x=9 is safe (empty).\n    *   *Strategy:* This pins me against the wall, but it also tightens the cage. If I go RIGHT, I am at (9,5). He is at (7,2). The distance is still 2 horizontal and 3 vertical.\n    *   *Comparison:* Moving DOWN gets me closer to his Y-level (Y=2). Moving RIGHT keeps me at Y=5.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to close the vertical distance. He is at the bottom (Y=2). I am in the middle (Y=5). To hunt him down, I must move DOWN. If I move RIGHT, I get stuck on the wall and he might slip past me to the left. If I move LEFT, I give him space.\nThe best way to box him in is to keep my X coordinate high (8 or 9) while lowering my Y coordinate to match his. **DOWN** is the move that closes the gap aggressively while keeping me on the \"cage\" side (X=8).\n\n**3) PLAN:**\nI am the predator. He is the prey. I will move DOWN to (8, 4). This brings me within striking distance. Next turn, I will likely need to move LEFT or DOWN again to intercept him. I am forcing him into a corner at the bottom right.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN",
