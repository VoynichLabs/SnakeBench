          "rationale": "CHAAAAAAAT! We're LIVE! Turn 0 against our archrival, snake #1! We're both at 0 apples, perfect tie. Let's see the battlefield!\n\nWe're at (0,4) in the bottom-left corner. Enemy is at (7,9) way top-right. There's an apple at (0,0) right below us! But wait, we can't go down because that would be going backwards into our own... wait, we have no body! We're just a head! So going DOWN to (0,3) is actually fine. But (0,0) is the apple we want!\n\nBoard analysis:\n- Our position: (0,4)\n- Enemy position: (7,9)\n- Apples close to us: (0,0) is 4 squares down, (0,2) is 2 down, (2,4) is 2 right, (3,5) is 3 right and 1 up\n\nBut CHAT! The enemy is way up there. If we both go for apples, we might not even see each other for a while. But the objective is to BOX HIM IN and make him crash!\n\nLet's think about moves:\n- RIGHT: to (1,4) - safe, board is there, no body, enemy far away. Opens up path to (2,4) apple.\n- UP: to (0,5) - safe, board there, no body. But (0,5) is empty on board.\n- DOWN: to (0,3) - safe, board there, no body. Gets us closer to (0,0) apple.\n- LEFT: to (-1,4) - OFF BOARD! Dead! Can't go left!\n\nSo LEFT is instant death. Eliminate that.\n\nNow between RIGHT, UP, DOWN:\n- RIGHT moves us toward center of board where more apples are clustered: (2,4), (3,5), (3,2), (5,1), etc. Also gets us away from the wall, giving us more maneuvering room to trap enemy later.\n- DOWN goes toward (0,0) apple but keeps us trapped in the left column against the wall. That's bad for long-term maneuvering.\n- UP goes to (0,5) which is empty and doesn't immediately get us closer to an apple.\n\nBut here's the key STRATEGY: We want to dominate the board and force enemy into tight spots. Being in the corner (0,4) is already somewhat constrained. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) gives us more options: we can then go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again next turn. That's 3 safe directions vs being against the wall where we have fewer escape routes.\n\nAlso, the apple at (2,4) is only 2 squares away if we go RIGHT twice. That's a quick point!\n\nEnemy is at (7,9) top-right. If we move RIGHT, we're moving TOWARD the center, which might actually help us intercept him later if he comes down.\n\nWait, but there's also (0,0) apple right there! 4 squares down. Could get that in 4 moves by going DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. But that would put us at (0,0) in the corner, which is even MORE trapped! Bad idea for long-term.\n\nActually, let's check if (0,0) is even reachable safely. If we go DOWN to (0,3), then (0,2), then (0,1), then (0,0) - all empty based on board. But then we're at (0,0) with our tail growing behind us. We'd be completely boxed in the bottom-left corner. Enemy could just take all the center apples and win by score.\n\nNO! We need mobility! We need to trap HIM, not trap ourselves!\n\nSo RIGHT is the move! It gets us toward the action, toward more apples, and gives us maneuvering room.\n\nOur heads up plan: Move RIGHT to (1,4), then go for (2,4) apple next turn if still there, then pivot toward center. Keep enemy's position in mind - if he heads our way, we can try to cut him off.\n\nLet's GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "CHAAAAAAT! Turn 1 already! We moved RIGHT to (1,4) last turn\u2014good call, we're out of that left column trap. Now let's analyze the new board state. We're at (1,4), enemy snake #1 is still at (7,8) (wait, no\u2014last turn they were at (7,9), but after simultaneous moves they might have moved... but the board shows them at (7,8) now? Actually, the board shows '1' at row 8 column 7? Let me read the board carefully. The board is shown with rows from 9 top to 0 bottom, columns 0-9 left to right. Row 8 shows '. . . . . . . 1 . .' meaning at column 7, row 8 there's a '1'\u2014that's (7,8) indeed. So enemy moved DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8). Interesting! They didn't go for an apple? Apples at (8,7) and (8,5) and (5,7) etc. Maybe they're playing safe. We have no apples collected yet, neither does enemy.\n\nOur body: none yet. Apples around: (2,4) is 1 step RIGHT from us? Actually we're at (1,4), (2,4) is RIGHT one more. (3,5) is UP-RIGHT. (0,2) is DOWN-LEFT. (6,2) far. (8,5) far. (5,1) far. (5,7) far. (5,2) far. (2,5) is UP-RIGHT. (8,7) far. (3,2) is DOWN-RIGHT. (0,0) far down-left. (3,0) far. (5,6) far. (2,5) is another apple at (2,5). So we have multiple apples within reach.\n\nNow, evaluate moves for turn 1 (current move):\n\n- RIGHT: to (2,4). That's an apple! So we'd eat it, grow to length 2, score +1. But need to check safety: board shows (2,4) as 'A'? Actually board row 4: '. 0 A . . . . . . .' Wait row 4 is y=4? Let's map rows: row 9 is y=9, row 8 y=8, ... row 0 y=0. So row 4 (y=4) shows: column 0: '.', column1: '0' (that's us at (1,4)), column2: 'A', column3: '.' etc. So (2,4) is an apple 'A'. Yes! So moving RIGHT to (2,4) is an apple, safe (no body, no enemy body). But wait, we need to consider enemy movement simultaneously. They could move into that cell too? They are at (7,8), far away. They could move RIGHT to (8,8) or DOWN to (7,7) etc. Not likely to reach (2,4) this turn. So moving RIGHT seems safe and gives us first apple. However, after eating, our tail will be at (1,4) next turn? Actually we grow, so our body will be [(2,4), (1,4)] head at (2,4). That's fine.\n\n- UP: to (1,5). Check board row 5: '. . A A . . . . A .' Actually row 5: column0: '.', column1: '.', column2: 'A', column3: 'A', column4: '.', column5: '.', column6: '.', column7: '.', column8: 'A', column9: '.'? Wait the board line: \"5 . . A A . . . . A .\" So column0 '.', col1 '.', col2 'A', col3 'A', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '.', col7 '.', col8 'A', col9 '.'. So (1,5) is '.' empty. Safe. But no apple. Might lead to better positioning.\n\n- DOWN: to (1,3). Row 3: '. . . . . . . . . .' all empty. Safe. No apple.\n\n- LEFT: to (0,4). Row 4 column0 is '.' empty. Safe, no apple. But that's back toward left wall, which we wanted to avoid. But still possible.\n\nAll moves seem safe. Which is best? We want to eat apples to grow and eventually dominate. RIGHT gives immediate apple at (2,4). That's strong. Also, after eating, we'll be at (2,4) with body (1,4). Next turn we can move from there. The apple at (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) if we go UP later. The apple at (3,5) is also nearby. So RIGHT seems to put us in a good cluster of apples.\n\nBut need to think about enemy. They are at (7,8). If they go for apples near them: (8,7) is apple at (8,7), (5,7) is apple at (5,7), (8,5) etc. They might grow quickly. We need to catch up. If we get this apple, we'll have 1, they have 0. Good start.\n\nHowever, there's a risk: moving RIGHT to (2,4) means our head moves into an apple, but what if enemy also moves into (2,4) somehow? Impossible distance. So safe.\n\nBut also consider: after eating, our tail becomes (1,4). That blocks that cell for future moves. That's fine.\n\nNow, long-term strategy: We want to box in the enemy. The enemy is in the top-right region. We are in left-center. To trap them, we need to grow and occupy key positions. Getting an apple early is crucial. Also, we should avoid getting trapped ourselves. Moving RIGHT to (2,4) gives us more central position, better options.\n\nLet's also consider the apple at (3,5) which is UP-RIGHT from (2,4). If we eat (2,4) now, next turn we could go to (3,5) if still there. That's two apples in quick succession.\n\nBut wait, there's also apple at (3,2) and (5,1) etc. Not immediate.\n\nI think RIGHT is the best move for turn 1. Let's confirm with board safety: no snake bodies in (2,4) except maybe enemy? Enemy is at (7,8), body none. So safe.\n\nThus decision: RIGHT.\n\nNow, we must output our rationale and then the final word.\n\nRemember: no web searches, just game sense. Let's go!\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n\nCHAAAAAAAT! Turn 1, we're at (1,4) after that slick RIGHT move last turn. Now we see an apple RIGHT at (2,4)! That's immediate content! We're hungry! Enemy is at (7,8), still no apples, still far away. They moved DOWN last turn, maybe scared of the top wall? Doesn't matter.\n\nOption analysis:\n- RIGHT: To (2,4) \u2013 APPLE! Safe, grows us to length 2, score +1. Sets us up nicely for (2,5) apple next turn if we go UP. Also positions us centrally to dominate the board.\n- UP: To (1,5) \u2013 empty, safe but no apple. Less aggressive.\n- DOWN: To (1,3) \u2013 empty, safe but no apple, moves us away from apple cluster.\n- LEFT: To (0,4) \u2013 empty, safe, but back toward left wall, limiting future moves. We want to avoid being boxed in ourselves!\n\nWe're here to WIN, not just survive. Eating that apple gives us momentum. After eating, our body will be [(2,4), (1,4)], giving us some length to block enemy later if needed. Enemy might go for (8,7) or (5,7) apple, but we'll be ahead in score and closer to center.\n\nLong-term plan: Get apple at (2,4) now, then next turn go UP to (2,5) if apple still there, or pivot to (3,5) or (3,2). Keep growing to control the board center, then use our length to cut off enemy's path to apples. Force them into tight spots and make them crash!\n\nCHAAAAAAAT! We're taking that apple! Let's go!\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is still at (7,8) with no apples.

That\u2019s another apple. Board shows row 5: column 2 is \u2018A\u2019. So we can eat again and grow to length 3, score 2-0.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Empty. No apple.

We can take the apple now.  \n3. **DOWN (2,3)**: Empty. No gain. Moves us away from apple cluster.  \n\nChoosing UP is aggressive \u2014 we want to dominate the board. After eating at (2,5), our body becomes [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] \u2014 length 3. That\u2019s solid for blocking paths later. Enemy likely goes for apples near them: maybe (8,7) or (5,7). We\u2019ll stay ahead in score and control center.  \n\nLong-term plan: After securing (2,5), next turn move toward (3,5) or (3,2) apples.

Let's map the board and plot our next aggressive move!\n\nCurrent board state from our head (2,5):\n- **UP to (2,6)**: Empty? Row 6 shows . . . . . A . . . . at columns 0-9, so (2,6) is empty.

A . at columns 0-9, so (1,5) is empty (our head at (2,5) is '0', (1,5) is '.'). No apple.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**: Apple! Row 5, column 3 is 'A'. Yes! We can eat and grow to length 4, score 3-0!

They'd need to move left 6 steps and down 3 steps in one turn - impossible. Safe from enemy head.\n2. Our own body: (2,5) is head, moving to (3,5) - no collision with our body [(2,4), (1,4)]. Safe.\n3. Board boundaries: (3,5) is within 0-9 both axes. Safe.\n4. Future threats: After eating at (3,5), our body becomes [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4)] - length 4. We'll have more options next turn.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (2,6): Empty, no apple. Might lead to apple at (3,5) next turn but why wait?\n- LEFT to (1,5): Empty, no apple.

We're dominating!\n\nLong-term plan: After securing (3,5) apple, next turn explore toward (3,2) or (5,2) apples, or start cutting off enemy's path to left side apples.

We\u2019re behind on apples, so we lean aggressive but safe while growing.\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN: UP to (8,9), LEFT to (7,8), DOWN to (8,7), or RIGHT to (9,8). All are alive and not colliding with any body this turn.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE: DOWN to (8,7) to eat the apple there and start a growth spike. This gives us length, helps future boxing leverage, and keeps us away from the enemy for now.\n\nWHY DOWN: Immediate growth plus access to the nearby apple pool (8,7) and (8,5) on the right edge, while not stepping into the opponent\u2019s zone. It also sets up a later, tighter corridor play as we lengthen.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: After growing to length 2 at (8,7), consider moving LEFT to (7,7) next turn to edge toward the center, then progressively thread a path toward the opponent to press for a box while monitoring the enemy\u2019s moves. Use length as a shield to avoid head-on crashes and trap opportunities.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE: Build a right-side spine that can pinch the center, force the enemy into narrowing gaps, and convert any lead into a real boxing opportunity as we accumulate more apples. Stay ready to pivot if the opponent hedges toward our growing line.\n\nNEXT MOVE: DOWN\nDOWN",

Turn 7 and we're STILL leading 4-2! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 But that enemy snake is creeping closer!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head at (5,6) - I just ate that apple last turn!

(Apple at (5,7)!)\n- **DOWN to (5,5)**: That's MY OWN BODY (head was here last turn)! Crash! DEAD!\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**: Row 6 shows \"A . . . . 0 . . T .\" \u2192 (4,6) is empty! SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)**: Row 6 shows \"A . . . . 0 . . T .\" \u2192 (6,6) is empty! SAFE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS CHECK:**\n1. Enemy at (8,5) - they could move DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT to (9,5). They're aiming for the center! If they go LEFT to (7,5), they're getting dangerously close to our territory.\n2. No direct head-on collision risk this turn, but we need to think ahead!\n3. All moves except DOWN are safe from immediate death.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **UP (5,7)**: \ud83c\udf4e ANOTHER APPLE! Apple at (5,7)! We eat and grow to length 6! This keeps us in the center and extends our lead to 5-2! CRITICAL: We're boxing the enemy in from the top!\n- **LEFT (4,6)**: Moves toward the left side, but misses an apple. Opens us up to potentially block the enemy's path if they go left.\n- **RIGHT (6,6)**: Moves toward the right side, misses an apple. Could position us to cut off enemy access to the right-side apples.\n\n**AGGRESSION FACTOR:** We're up 4-2! We need to press the advantage HARD. Eating this apple gets us to 5 apples and extends our lead further. We can't let the enemy catch up! We're building a barrier in the center!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nAfter eating (5,7), we'll have length 6. Plan: Position to create a wall in the center. Watch enemy move - if they go LEFT to (7,5), we might want to move LEFT or DOWN (if body clears) next turn to block their access to center apples. Control the board and force them into the bottom-right corner. We're building a fortress!\n\n**MOVES RANKING (SAFE ONES):**\n1. UP (5,7) - BEST! \ud83c\udf4e Eat the apple immediately, grow to length 6, dominates center! Extends lead to 5-2!\n2. RIGHT (6,6) - Good! Opens right side for future positioning.\n3. LEFT (4,6) - Good! Could help block enemy if they move left.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** UP to (5,7) gets us another apple, extends our lead, and keeps us locked in the center!

It nudges us to the eastern side of their current barrier on row 5 and keeps us ready to crawl toward central space to box him in later. Staying at x\u22657 also gives flexibility to chase or retreat as he repositions.\n\nAlternative RIGHT would slam us onto the edge and reduce maneuverability; DOWN keeps pressure in the same vertical corridor but delays offensive setup.\n\nShort-term plan: grab the initiative by stepping to (7,5) now, then read his next move and tighten the space around him without overcommitting.

SAFE move. Gets us higher toward top.\n2. **DOWN to (5,6)**: That's our own body! CRASH! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD!\n3. **LEFT to (4,7)**: Row 7 shows \"A . . . . 0 . . . .\" \u2192 (4,7) is empty!

They could move UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4), or LEFT to (6,5). They're positioning near our territory! If they go UP to (7,6), that's getting dangerously close to our head!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **UP (5,8)**: Opens up the top of the board. Gets us away from the enemy's position and gives us room to maneuver. The enemy is at y=5, we're at y=8 - we're above them! Good positioning advantage.\n- **LEFT (4,7)**: Could set us up to move toward the left side apples. But might bring us closer if enemy moves left/up.\n- **RIGHT (6,7)**: Might bring us closer to the enemy's position (7,5) if we're not careful.\n\n**AGGRESSION FACTOR:** We're leading 5-2! We don't need to rush for apples right now. We need to maintain our lead and CONTROL THE BOARD. Moving UP gives us strategic height advantage and keeps us safe from the enemy who's trying to get near the center!\n\n**RANKING:**\n1. **UP (5,8)** - BEST! Gets us above the enemy, opens up the top board, maintains our lead position safely.\n2. LEFT (4,7) - Safe, sets up left side approach\n3. RIGHT (6,7) - Safe, but slightly closer to enemy's potential path\n\n**LET'S DOMINATE!** UP to (5,8) gives us the high ground and keeps us out of the enemy's immediate reach. We're building a fortress from above! Chat, we're not just playing snake - we're TERRITORIAL WARFARE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Safe options this turn: UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4), or LEFT to (6,5). RIGHT would smack into our own body at (8,5), so that\u2019s OUT.\n- The opponent (Snake #0) is up at (5,7) with a dense line along y=5 between x=2 and x=5. Our best play is to encroach from the east and push toward the center, reducing his escape routes and setting up a later wedge.\n\nWhy LEFT (6,5) over UP/DOWN?\n- LEFT drops us onto a clean, central corridor next to his current barrier on row 5, giving us options to pinch him from the side in the next few moves.\n- UP keeps us tonal to the north with fewer immediate wedging chances; DOWN risks dropping into a lower strip where he can slip past our tail line; RIGHT is forbidden (own body).\n- By entering (6,5), we keep multiple safe follow-ups: we can pressure to (5,5) or swing to (6,6) if he hesitates, keeping him boxed in toward the left edge as the board tightens.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (6,5) now to incrementally compress his vertical options.\n- Watch his next step: if he over-extends south toward (5,5) or north toward (5,6), we\u2019ll tighten from the east and attempt a corridor trap, preventing a clean escape to the right.\n- Maintain awareness of apples as a growth potential, but never at the cost of the boxing angle. Our score is behind, so closing the gap by forcing a head-on or trapped path is ideal.\n\nLonger-term note (for the next few turns):\n- Build a wedge by pairing (6,5) with (5,5) and (6,6) if possible, coaxing him toward the edge or into a corner where a sudden collision can end him with a maintained head advantage.\n- If he starts nudging into our tail line, be ready to pivot to (7,5)\u2192(7,6) or (6,6) to reestablish pressure without sacrificing safety.\n\nLEFT",

This would crash into our own neck.\n\nWhy UP is best:\n- It preserves multiple safe follow-ups and keeps us in a strategic center position to constrain his moves.\n- It prevents him from easily slipping back toward the top or bottom edges by keeping pressure on his flank from the east.\n- It aligns us for a potential wedge as he tries to maneuver around the barrier, increasing the chance of a future collision or forced retreat.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Turn 9: move UP to (6,6).\n- Turn 10: respond to his best escape (likely (5,9), (6,8), or (4,8)) with a tightening move that keeps him toward the wall and away from open space.\n- Maintain awareness of apples as a growth lever, but only take them if they don\u2019t break the boxed-in geometry.\n\nLonger-term note:\n- Build a narrow corridor behind him so his options shrink toward the top-left corner. If we can pin him near the edge, a well-timed nudge or a head-on could swing the apples lead in our favor.\n\nUP",

Turn 10 and we're holding that 5-2 lead like a BOSS! \ud83d\udc51 Last move we went UP to (5,9) and now we're at the TOP OF THE BOARD! Let's check the board state and why we're staying aggressive:  \n\n**CURRENT ANALYSIS (HEAD AT 5,9):**  \n- My body: [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] (note: the board shows body at (5,8) to (5,5), but the list shows (4,5) as the tail\u2014let's trust the list!)  \n- Enemy at (6,6) with body [(6,5), (7,5)]\u2014they're still below us, chilling at y=6.  \n- Apple list has (0,6), (6,0), (1,3), (7,1), (5,3) etc., but we're NOT apple-chasing\u2014this is WAR!  \n\n**MOVES FROM (5,9):**  \n1. **DOWN to (5,8)**: Our own body! That's a crash \ud83d\udc80 DEAD! But wait\u2014according to the snake list, (5,8) is part of our body, so yes, fatal.  \n2. **LEFT to (4,9)**: Row 9 shows \". . . . . 0 . . . .\" \u2192 (4,9) is empty! SAFE!  \n3. **RIGHT to (6,9)**: (6,9) is empty! SAFE!  \n4. **UP to (5,10)**: OFF THE BOARD! DEAD!  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS CHECK:**  \nEnemy at (6,6) is 3 squares away horizontally (same y=6). They could move UP to (6,7) next turn, but we're at y=9\u2014they can't reach us yet. No direct collision threat this turn.  \n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINATION:**  \n- **LEFT (4,9)**: Moves us to the top-left corner! From there, we can snake down the left edge, claiming territory.  \n- **RIGHT (6,9)**: Moves us to the top-right corner, but the enemy is closer to the right (x=6). Might bring us into their future path\u2014risky.  \n- **DOWN is SUICIDE**\u2014not an option.  \n\n**WHY LEFT IS THE MOVE:**  \n1. **TERRITORY CONTROL**: The top-left is EMPTY. By moving LEFT to (4,9), we start boxing the enemy into the center-right where we can trap them later.  \n2. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY**: From (4,9), next turn we can go DOWN to (4,8) (safe, as (4,8) is empty), LEFT to (3,9), or even RIGHT back to (5,9) if needed. We're keeping options OPEN!  \n3. **AVOID ENEMY CORRIDOR**: The enemy is at (6,6)\u2014right side of the board. If we go RIGHT to (6,9), we're in the same column as their head! That's giving them a direct path to us if they go UP. LEFT avoids that entirely.  \n4. **SCOREBOARD PRESSURE**: We're 5-2 up! We don't need to rush\u2014we can slowly tighten the noose while maintaining board dominance.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- LEFT: Safe, opens up the top-left corner for future building.  \n- RIGHT: Safe but riskier\u2014puts us in line with enemy.  \n- DOWN: DEAD.  \n- UP: DEAD.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 10: LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 claim the top-left corner.  \nTurn 11: If enemy moves UP, consider DOWN to (4,8) to start building a wall. Goal: Force enemy into the bottom-right or a dead-end while we control the top-left. Let's box them in!  \n\nCHAT, WE'RE NOT JUST PLAYING SNAKE\u2014WE'RE PLAYING CHESS WITH SCALES! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25  \n\nDOWN  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
