There are apples at (2, 9), (3, 9), (7, 2), (4, 7), and (3, 3).\n\nMy last move was UP, which moved me to (5, 6). This was a safe move.

Eating this apple would increase my score and help me avoid a quick death. I do not see any immediate risks associated with eating the apple at (2,9).\n\nI also need to consider the position of snake #0. It's at (3, 3), which is relatively close. I am at (5, 6). If I eat the apple at (2, 9), I'll move to (2, 9) and then snake #0 will move, leaving us with a potential for a close encounter.\n\nHowever, since I'm already at (5, 6), a move towards the apple at (2, 9) is not optimal. I should consider a move that leads me closer to a more distant apple or allows me to maneuver better to avoid potential collisions.\n\nGiven the current state, I would prioritize a move that allows me to get closer to an apple, even if it means a slightly increased risk. Moving UP to (5, 6) is safe, and it still potentially allows me to move closer to the (2, 9) apple in the future. Also I do not foresee any immediate threats from snake #0.\n\nUP",
