It moves me directly toward the apple at (7, 5), which is only 3 cells away. This is the nearest apple that's not blocked. The path is clear and unobstructed.\n\nThe enemy at (3, 0) is far away and not a threat to my position.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** \nAfter moving UP to (7, 3), continue moving up to reach (7, 5) for the apple. Then transition toward the (5, 7) and (2, 7) apple cluster in the upper-middle region of the board.\n\nUP",
