This will keep the snake moving in a direction that is safe and reduces the distance to the closest apple.\n- **Avoiding Traps**: Since the snake is just a single segment, moving in a straight line is safe and avoids getting trapped.\n- **Enemy Movement**: The enemy is at (7,3), which is far away and not a direct threat.

Not ideal for short-term progress.\n2. **DOWN (2,5):** Safe, but moves away from the closest apple (0,7). Also, the enemy is at (7,3), which is far but could eventually threaten if we grow.\n3. **LEFT (0,5):** Safe and moves directly toward the closest apple (0,7). Reduces distance to the next apple (0,0) in the future.\n4. **RIGHT (2,5):** Safe but moves away from the closest apple (0,7). Not optimal.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\n- The enemy is far away (7,3) and has no body segments. No immediate collision risk, but we should avoid moving toward their potential future path if they grow.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- **Short-term:** Prioritize moving toward the nearest apple (0,7) via LEFT. This keeps the snake in a straight line, reducing future collision risks.\n- **Mid-term:** After eating (0,7), the next closest apple is (0,0). We\u2019ll need to pivot carefully to avoid the enemy\u2019s potential expansion.\n- **Avoid:** Moving directly toward the enemy\u2019s general direction (e.g., down/right) until we have more body segments to block paths.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n**LEFT**",
