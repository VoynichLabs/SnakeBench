Wait \u2014 simultaneous move: both choose destination before resolving. If I go DOWN to (5, 7) and enemy goes UP to (5, 8), we don\u2019t collide because heads don\u2019t occupy same cell. But enemy\u2019s body is at (6, 7), so (5, 7) is empty now \u2014 but enemy\u2019s head leaves (5, 7) empty before I arrive? No \u2014 order: both move at same time:  \n- My head from (5, 8) to (5, 7)  \n- Enemy head from (5, 7) to somewhere else  \nThus (5, 7) is empty when I arrive if enemy leaves. But if enemy chooses to stay in (5, 7) (impossible because staying means choosing a move that ends in same square \u2014 not allowed, they must move to adjacent cell), so enemy cannot stay.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 7): UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7) [invalid: body there].  \nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 8), my old position, that\u2019s fine for me if I go DOWN to (5, 7) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nBut check collision rules:  \n- If two heads move into same cell \u2192 both die.  \n- If a head moves into a body segment \u2192 that snake dies.  \n\nSo: If I go DOWN to (5, 7) and enemy goes LEFT to (4, 7) or DOWN to (5, 6), no collision.  \nBut if enemy goes RIGHT to (6, 7), enemy dies immediately (hits own body), I survive.  \nSo actually DOWN is safe? Let\u2019s verify:  \nAt turn start: enemy body at (6, 7). Enemy head at (5, 7).  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7), enemy dies. That happens before I arrive? Yes \u2014 all moves simultaneous, so enemy dies because they hit their own body, I survive.  \n\nBut \u2014 enemy\u2019s RIGHT is invalid for them (suicide), so they won\u2019t choose it likely. But I must consider all possibilities \u2014 since I don\u2019t control enemy, I must assume they might pick a safe move for them. Their safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 8) and I go DOWN to (5, 7), no collision.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5, 6) and I go DOWN to (5, 7), no collision.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4, 7) and I go DOWN to (5, 7), no collision.  \n\nSo actually DOWN is safe? Wait \u2014 what about my own body? My body is at (5, 9), so (5, 7) is not my body. Yes, so DOWN is safe.  \n\nBut earlier I thought DOWN was unsafe \u2014 mistake: I confused enemy\u2019s current head position with my possible move.  \n\nLet\u2019s recheck:  \nAt start: enemy head at (5, 7). I\u2019m at (5, 8).  \nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7), enemy must move away (can\u2019t stay), so no head-on collision unless enemy moves into (5, 7) from somewhere else \u2014 impossible since only adjacent cells matter and enemy starts at (5, 7). So enemy won\u2019t be in (5, 7) after move unless\u2026 Actually, enemy can\u2019t end turn in (5, 7) because they must move to an adjacent cell, so they can\u2019t stay.  \n\nThus DOWN is safe.  \n\nSo all moves are safe except UP into my body at (5, 9).  \n\nSafe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nApples: (0, 8) \u2014 close to me at (5, 8)? Distance: 5 steps.  \n(3, 3) \u2014 5 steps.  \n(2, 4) \u2014 4 steps.  \n(6, 2) \u2014 4 steps.  \n(8, 1) \u2014 far.  \n\nClosest: (0, 8) is same y, far left. (2, 4) and (3, 3) and (6, 2) are closer in Manhattan distance.  \n\nEnemy at (5, 7) might go for (6, 2) apple \u2014 DOWN LEFT moves.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 8), I can go DOWN next toward (3, 3)/(2, 4).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 8), I can go DOWN toward (6, 2) apple \u2014 but enemy might compete for that.  \nIf I go DOWN to (5, 7), puts me adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible positions \u2014 risky next turn because if enemy goes UP to (5, 8) and I\u2019m at (5, 7), possible head-on if we move into each other next turn.  \n\nBetter to avoid close proximity to enemy head when possible.  \n\nLEFT seems safe and opens path to left-side apples.  \n\n**Next turn flexibility:**  \nFrom (4, 8): possible moves UP (4, 9) \u2014 empty, DOWN (4, 7) \u2014 empty, LEFT (3, 8) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (5, 8) \u2014 empty after I move. Good options.  \n\nFrom (6, 8): UP (6, 9) \u2014 empty, DOWN (6, 7) \u2014 enemy body (deadly), LEFT (5, 8) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (7, 8) \u2014 empty. So one unsafe move (DOWN).  \n\nFrom (5, 7): UP (5, 8) \u2014 empty, DOWN (5, 6) \u2014 empty, LEFT (4, 7) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (6, 7) \u2014 enemy body (deadly). Also one unsafe move.  \n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT offer 3 safe next moves, DOWN offers 3 safe next moves \u2014 similar.  \n\nBut LEFT gets me toward less contested apples (left side). Enemy is near right-side apples.  \n\n**Plan:** Go LEFT to claim left-side apples and avoid enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

Possible moves from (2, 8)\n\n- **UP (2, 9)**: Currently empty. Safe unless enemy moves there. The enemy at (2, 7) can only reach (2, 9) by going UP twice this turn? No, they can only move one step. So (2, 9) is safe. It's also an edge, reducing next turn's safe moves to 3 (down, left, right? Let's check: (2,9): Up is off-board, so only left (1,9), down (2,8), right (3,9)). Wait, (3,9) is empty. So 3 safe moves from (2,9) are possible.\n- **DOWN (2, 7)**: CURRENTLY enemy head. This is a head-on collision if we both choose to go into that square. Simultaneous move: we both die if head-on. **Down is extremely dangerous** (not guaranteed death but high risk). Avoid.\n- **LEFT (1, 8)**: Currently empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (3, 8)**: My own body. DEATH. **Not safe.**\n\n**Immediately unsafe moves:** DOWN (risky head-on collision), RIGHT (into own body).\n\n**Check DOWN more carefully:** Snake #1 at (2,7) can move UP (to 2,8), DOWN (to 2,6), LEFT (to 1,7), RIGHT (to 3,7).\n- If I go DOWN to (2,7) and enemy goes UP to (2,8): We swap positions, no collision? Wait: Head-on collision is when two heads move into the same cell simultaneously. We are moving into each other's previous positions; that is safe. Actually, let me double-check the rule: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" Here, I move to (2,7), enemy moves to (2,8) \u2013 different cells. So no head-on collision. My old head position (2,8) becomes empty, enemy's old head position (2,7) becomes empty, no collision. But what about resulting positions after move?\nAfter move:\n- Me: head (2,7), body [(2,8)]\n- Enemy: head (2,8), body [(2,7)]??? Wait, enemy's body is [(3,7)]. So enemy's body remains [(3,7)], head (2,8).\nMy body is [(2,8)]. Enemy's head is on my old head position (2,8) which is now my neck/body. That kills enemy! Yes! Because \"if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\"\nSo if enemy goes UP and I go DOWN, enemy dies and I live (I just moved to an empty cell (2,7)).\nActually, that's a good outcome for me? Hmm.\n\nWhat if enemy goes DOWN to (2,6)? Then (2,7) is empty, I move there safely.\nWhat if enemy goes LEFT to (1,7)? Then (2,7) empty, safe for me.\nWhat if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,7)? That's enemy's own body, impossible for enemy.\n\nSo actually, DOWN is safe for me and might kill enemy if enemy moves into my neck. So maybe DOWN is not dangerous for me? Wait, but if enemy chooses to stay still? They can't; they must move.\nCheck: is there any enemy move that kills me if I go DOWN? Only if enemy also goes to (2,7). But enemy cannot move to (2,7) because they start there; they must leave it. So DOWN is actually safe for me! Yes. Because the only danger is head-on collision into same cell, but enemy can't be in (2,7) after the move because they moved away.\n\nSo **DOWN is safe**. Earlier I misjudged it as dangerous.\n\nRevised safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. (RIGHT is into own body, unsafe.)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Next-turn flexibility\n\n- **UP (2, 9)**: Next moves: DOWN (2,8), LEFT (1,9), RIGHT (3,9). All likely safe. 3 options. Good.\n- **DOWN (2, 7)**: Next moves: UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). But RIGHT (3,7) is enemy body segment (3,7)? Let's check: after this turn, enemy head and body will change. If enemy went UP (2,8), they die (as reasoned). So maybe their body stays (3,7). So (3,7) is dangerous next turn. So from (2,7), safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options). Good.\n- **LEFT (1, 8)**: Next moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8). Right (2,8) is my body segment? After I move to (1,8), my body is [(2,8)]. So (2,8) is my neck, safe to go back? Wait, rule: \"moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself.\" Moving from (1,8) to (2,8) is not backwards? Let's check: my body after move: head (1,8), body segments: [(2,8), ...]. The cell behind head is determined by head and first body segment vector: from head (1,8) to neck (2,8) is direction RIGHT. So backwards would be LEFT from head. So moving RIGHT to (2,8) is into neck, but not backwards; actually it's forward into own body segment = death. So RIGHT is unsafe next turn from (1,8). So safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).\n\nAll three safe moves yield 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and strategy\n\nApples: (0,8) is very close! Manhattan distance = 2 from (2,8) via LEFT then LEFT.\nFrom (2,8):\n- To (0,8): dist 2.\n- To (2,4): dist 4.\n- To (3,3): dist 6.\nUP takes me away from (0,8). DOWN takes me towards middle apples but closer to enemy. LEFT takes me directly toward (0,8).\n\nGiven (0,8) is right there, LEFT seems strongly advantageous.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Enemy proximity and risk\n\nEnemy at (2,7). If I go LEFT to (1,8), enemy's possible moves:\n- UP (2,8) \u2013 empty (my old head) but my body segment (3,8) is there? Wait, my body segment after I move: my body will be [(3,8)] if I don't eat apple, so (2,8) is empty. So enemy can go to (2,8) safely.\n- No direct threat to me at (1,8) from enemy's possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Minimal risk.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,7) \u2013 kills enemy if enemy goes UP, otherwise fine. But delays getting apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Get apple (0,8) next turn if possible, then maybe (2,4). Stay on left side to avoid enemy. Keep escape routes.\n\nLEFT seems optimal.\n\nLEFT",

All likely safe \u2192 3 options.\n- **DOWN (1, 7)**: Next moves: UP (1, 8), DOWN (1, 6), LEFT (0, 7), RIGHT (2, 7). RIGHT (2, 7) is enemy body \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves.\n\nUP and DOWN offer slightly better flexibility, but LEFT gets me an apple immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term positioning\n\nEating the apple at (0, 8) puts me in the top-left corner with reduced mobility, but I can then head DOWN toward other apples (2, 4) and (3, 3). The enemy is currently in the middle-right area and not threatening.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT is optimal\u2014it safely collects an apple, increasing my score to 2, and keeps me away from the enemy. The slight reduction in next-turn mobility is acceptable given the immediate gain.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating the apple at (0, 8), move DOWN to (0, 7) to escape the corner and head toward the cluster of apples at (2, 4) and (3, 3). Monitor enemy movement.\n\nLEFT\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Enemy threat  \nEnemy at (2,3) \u2014 possible moves: UP (2,4) body, DOWN (2,2) safe, LEFT (1,3) safe, RIGHT (3,3) apple.  \nEnemy likely goes RIGHT to (3,3) for apple. That\u2019s away from me currently.  \n\nNo immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Next-turn flexibility from each safe move  \n- **UP (1,8)**: Next moves: UP (1,9) safe, DOWN (1,7) body? Yes \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (0,8) body? Yes \u2014 unsafe, RIGHT (2,8) safe. So only UP and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 limited.  \n- **DOWN (1,6)**: Next moves: UP (1,7) body? Yes \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (1,5) safe, LEFT (0,6) safe, RIGHT (2,6) safe. So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe \u2014 more options.  \n- **RIGHT (2,7)**: Next moves: UP (2,8) safe, DOWN (2,6) safe, LEFT (1,7) body? Yes \u2014 unsafe, RIGHT (3,7) safe. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe \u2014 good options.  \n\nDOWN and RIGHT both offer 3 safe moves next turn; UP offers only 2.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term positioning  \nUP leads toward top-left corner \u2014 could be trapping.  \nDOWN opens path to apple (0,5) but also toward enemy area soon.  \nRIGHT moves toward center \u2014 best for flexibility and future apple access (3,3) and (5,8).  \n\nGiven enemy might take (3,3), maybe head toward (5,8) via RIGHT then UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT keeps options open and moves toward center/apples while avoiding traps.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,7), consider moving UP toward (5,8) or DOWN toward (3,3) depending on enemy movement. Stay central for flexibility.  \n\nRIGHT",

Apple proximity:**  \nApple at (8, 4) is below \u2014 moving DOWN gets me closer to it.  \nApple at (9, 5) is also reachable from the right side later.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note:**  \nMoving DOWN keeps options open and avoids trapping myself near the top edge.  \nFrom (7, 6), I can go DOWN toward (8, 4) apple next turns, or LEFT/RIGHT to maneuver.  \n\n---\n\n**Best move:** DOWN \u2014 maximizes future flexibility and moves toward apple (8, 4).  \n\nDOWN",

Which position gives me better future options?\n2. Which move positions me better to reach the available apples?\n3. Safety considerations regarding the enemy snake\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake at (8, 7) could move:\n- UP to (8, 8) - empty\n- DOWN to (8, 6) - would hit its own body \u2717\n- LEFT to (7, 7) - empty\n- RIGHT to (9, 7) - empty\n\nSo the enemy snake has 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Comparing the two safe moves:**\n- If I move DOWN to (8, 3): I'm moving away from the enemy and positioning myself in a more open area. From (8, 3), I could potentially reach the apple at (5, 5) by continuing down and left, or the apple at (9, 5) by moving up and right later.\n- If I move LEFT to (7, 4): I'm staying at the same y-level and moving toward the center. From (7, 4), I could potentially reach the apple at (5, 5) or (0, 5) by continuing left, or move up toward (5, 9) or (3, 9).\n\n**Key consideration:**\nThe apple at (5, 5) is the closest apple to me and seems reachable from either position. However, moving LEFT to (7, 4) puts me slightly closer to (5, 5) and keeps me more centralized with better future options.\n\n**Best move:**\nLEFT to (7, 4). This:\n1. Keeps me safe \u2713\n2. Moves me toward the center of the board\n3. Positions me better to reach the apple at (5, 5) \n4. Gives me good future mobility options\n5. Maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\nLEFT",

Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 6 apples vs my 3 \u2014 need to catch up.  \nLEFT to (6, 8) keeps flexibility high, then next turn maybe UP to (6, 9) toward (5, 9) apple, or DOWN/LEFT to avoid enemy.

Securing (5, 9) now is good, but must ensure I don\u2019t get trapped.  \nFrom (5, 9), next turn I can go LEFT or RIGHT safely. That\u2019s enough to escape top edge.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nIf I take UP: eat apple, next turn go LEFT to (4, 9) \u2014 safe, then possibly down toward (3, 9) area.  \nIf I take LEFT: next turn UP to (4, 9) then maybe get (3, 9) after.\n\nBut enemy may get (5, 9) soon if I don\u2019t take it. Better to secure it now and manage the risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP gets apple, increases score, and enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn. The reduction in next-turn options is manageable.\n\nUP",

It's very close (just 2 moves away), uncontested, and DOWN continues my direct path toward it.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN to (5, 2) is optimal because:\n1. Keeps me safe \u2713\n2. Continues my direct path to the closest apple at (5, 1)\n3. After collecting (5, 1), I'll have 8 apples and can reassess\n4. Maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Future strategy:**\nContinue toward (5, 1) which I can reach in 2 turns. After securing that apple, evaluate whether to go for (2, 6) or (0, 5) depending on enemy positioning.\n\nDOWN",

Maintain space to avoid dead-ends.  \n\nDOWN",

DOWN is suicidal.\n\n**Strategic analysis - targeting nearby apples:**\nThe closest apples from (3, 2) are:\n1. (1, 3) - Only 3 cells away (2 left, 1 up) - very close and reachable!\n2. (0, 5) - 6 cells away (3 left, 3 up)\n3. (7, 0) - 6 cells away (4 right, 2 down)\n4. (3, 9) - 7 cells away\n5.

They could go RIGHT to (3, 6) then UP towards (3, 9), or possibly go for (0, 5).\n\n**Best move assessment:**\nLEFT to (2, 2) is my best option because:\n1. Keeps me safe $\u2713$\n2. Moves me directly toward the closest apple at (1, 3) - only 2 cells away after this move $\u2713$\n3. From (2, 2), I can go UP to (2, 3) then LEFT to (1, 3) to eat the apple $\u2713$\n4. Maintains good distance from the enemy at (2, 6) $\u2713$\n5. Avoids getting trapped in the right side where my long body is $\u2713$\n\n**Route plan:**\nMy optimal path: LEFT to (2, 2) \u2192 UP to (2, 3) \u2192 LEFT to (1, 3) to eat the apple.

Long-term:**  \nEnemy longer (9 vs my 6), so avoid head-on collisions.  \nBetter to collect apples on left side (0,5) and (1,3) before enemy gets there.  \nRIGHT reduces flexibility and risks future entrapment near enemy.\n\n---\n\n**6.

Enemy threat this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (2, 5): possible moves:  \n- UP (2, 6): my body \u2014 unsafe for enemy (it would die).  \n- DOWN (2, 4): its body \u2014 unsafe for enemy.  \n- LEFT (1, 5): my body \u2014 unsafe for enemy.  \n- RIGHT (3, 5): empty \u2014 safe for enemy.  \n\nSo enemy can only go RIGHT to (3, 5). That means enemy is moving away from me this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Next-turn flexibility after each safe move:**  \n\n**Option DOWN to (0, 1):**  \nFrom (0, 1):  \n- UP (0, 2): my body \u2014 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (0, 0): empty \u2014 safe.  \n- LEFT off board \u2014 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (1, 1): empty \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo next turn from (0, 1): safe moves = DOWN, RIGHT.  \nThat\u2019s better than last turn\u2019s situation \u2014 more options.\n\n**Option RIGHT to (1, 2):**  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP (1, 3): enemy body \u2014 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (1, 1): empty \u2014 safe.  \n- LEFT (0, 2): my body \u2014 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2): enemy body \u2014 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn from (1, 2): safe moves = only DOWN.  \nThat\u2019s risky \u2014 similar trap as before but now along x=1 column.\n\n---\n\n**4. Long-term plan:**  \nGoing DOWN to (0, 1) gives more options next turn.  \nFrom (0, 1), I can go RIGHT toward bottom-row apples (7, 0) or (9, 0), or continue DOWN to (0, 0) then RIGHT.  \nEnemy is moving to (3, 5), so it\u2019s far from bottom-left area.  \nRIGHT now leads to a potential trap next turn (only DOWN available).  \n\nBetter to go DOWN now to keep future flexibility.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Apples:**  \nClosest apple is (7, 4) \u2014 requires moving right and up from here.  \nApple at (7, 0) is far down-left but blocked by my body.  \nApple at (8, 8) is far up-right.  \n\nUP and RIGHT both move toward apples. LEFT moves away from most apples.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (2, 8), body blocks top-left area. Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (2, 8): UP (2, 9) its body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (2, 7) empty, LEFT (1, 8) empty, RIGHT (3, 8) its body \u2192 unsafe. So enemy likely moves DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1, 8), that\u2019s far from me. If DOWN to (2, 7), still far. No immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (6 vs 10). Need to catch up.  \nUP moves toward apples (7,4), (8,8), (9,5).  \nRIGHT also moves toward apples but less directly upward.  \nLEFT moves toward (7,0) but that\u2019s blocked by my body \u2014 would require long detour.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP and RIGHT are both safe and move toward apples. UP is slightly better because it opens more vertical space toward multiple apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After UP, continue moving right/up toward apples, avoiding enemy body zones.  \n\nUP",

Apples proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (7, 4): 1 move away if I go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.  \n- (8, 8): far but in upper-right.  \n- (9, 5): far upper-right.  \n- (7, 0): far lower-right.  \n- (9, 0): far lower-right.  \n\nRIGHT puts me at (7, 3), then UP to (7, 4) gets an apple next turn if safe.  \nUP puts me at (6, 4), then RIGHT to (7, 4) also gets apple next turn if safe.  \n\nBut enemy head at (1, 9) is far from (7, 4) \u2014 unlikely to reach it in 1 move (needs 6 steps horizontally + vertically). So apple (7, 4) is safe to target.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head (1, 9) can move UP (1, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (1, 8) its body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (0, 9) empty, RIGHT (2, 9) its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo enemy can only go LEFT to (0, 9). That\u2019s far from me.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term strategy:**  \nI\u2019m behind 6 vs 10 apples. Need to catch up.  \nThe apple at (7, 4) is the closest.  \nFrom (6, 3), both UP and RIGHT set up to eat (7, 4) next turn.  \nBut UP first might be slightly better because:  \n- UP to (6, 4) \u2192 next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 4) for apple, or if enemy somehow threatens, I can go LEFT to (5, 4) or UP to (6, 5).  \n- RIGHT first to (7, 3) \u2192 next turn UP to (7, 4) for apple, but if enemy head moves toward me later, I\u2019m closer to right edge (less space).  \n\nActually, both are safe, but UP keeps me more central for future options after eating (7, 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP, aim for (7, 4) if safe, then work toward (8, 8) or (9, 5) while avoiding the enemy\u2019s long body in columns 1\u20133 top area.

Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (8, 8) \u2014 distance 4 (1 right + 4 up)  \n- (9, 5) \u2014 distance 3 (2 right + 1 up)  \n- (7, 0) \u2014 distance 4 (4 down)  \n- (9, 0) \u2014 distance 6  \n- (5, 0) \u2014 distance 5  \n\nFrom (7, 4):  \n- **RIGHT** (8, 4) \u2192 closer to (9, 5) and (8, 8)  \n- **UP** (7, 5) \u2192 closer to (8, 8)  \n- **DOWN** (7, 3) \u2192 closer to (7, 0) but far from others  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future flexibility:**  \nAfter **RIGHT** to (8, 4): next turn safe moves: UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (9, 4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nAfter **UP** to (7, 5): next turn safe moves: UP (7, 6), DOWN (7, 4) my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (6, 5) empty, RIGHT (8, 5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nAfter **DOWN** to (7, 3): next turn safe moves: UP (7, 4) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (7, 2) empty, LEFT (6, 3) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (8, 3) empty \u2192 2 safe moves. Worse.  \n\nSo DOWN reduces future options.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 10 apples vs my 7. Need to catch up. Apples (9, 5) and (8, 8) are top priority.  \nAvoid getting trapped in bottom-left where enemy\u2019s long body is.  \n\nRIGHT seems best \u2014 moves toward high-value apples and keeps flexibility.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

I now have 11 apples vs the enemy's 9. Now I need to plan my route to the bottom row apples at (5, 0), (7, 0), and (9, 0).\n\n- **RIGHT towards (2, 2)**: This is the most strategic move! It positions me to:\n  - Move toward the bottom row apples (5, 0), (7, 0), and (9, 0)\n  - Creates distance from my body in column 1\n  - Opens up more future move options\n  \n- **DOWN to (1, 1)**: Moves me away from the apple path, doesn't help me reach the bottom row apples efficiently\n  \n- **LEFT to (0, 2)**: Moves me toward the edge, limits my future options\n\n**Best path to apples:**\nFrom my current position at (1, 2), the optimal route to the bottom apples is:\n- RIGHT to (2, 2), then (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)\n- Then DOWN along column 9 to reach apples at (9, 0), (7, 0), and (5, 0)\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 8), moving in the top-right area. They're very far from the bottom row apples, so I have a clear path to collect all three.\n\nMoving RIGHT now gives me the best trajectory toward those apples while maintaining safety and keeping future options open.\n\n**Future planning:**\nAfter moving to (2, 2), I should continue RIGHT along row 2 until I reach column 9, then head DOWN to collect the bottom row apples systematically. This will extend my lead significantly (potentially 14 apples vs enemy's 9).\n\nRIGHT",
