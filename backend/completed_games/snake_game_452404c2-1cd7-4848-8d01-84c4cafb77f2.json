While it doesn't bring me closer to the apple, it doesn\u2019t have immediate negative consequences and keeps options open.\n   \n2. **DOWN (to (6, 1))**: This space is also currently held by my body. This is not a valid move since I can't move back into my own body.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (5, 2))**: This space is empty, but it does not progress me toward any apples. It just moves me further away horizontally.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (7, 2))**: This would take me back to the position I just vacated, which is also not valid as it is moving backward.\n\nThe best option seems to be to move **UP (to (6, 3))**, as it lets me maintain positioning and keeps my options open while I can consider how to access (6, 0) next. \n\nOnce I do go up, my strategy will be to reposition for the next turn to access (6, 1) and from there move down to (6, 0) where the apple is waiting.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP."

Next turn I should move LEFT again to (6, 0) to collect that apple, unless the enemy snake interferes. Keep monitoring the enemy's movements.\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (7, 0), but with my current plan, I have not directly approached any opposing snake territory.\n\n5. **Possible Future Moves**: After reaching (6, 3), I will strategize between moving UP toward (6, 4) or consider shifts towards different directions if necessary.\n\nHaving analyzed the potential moves and future placements, the decision is clear.

I successfully collected the first apple at (0, 0) and grew to length 4\n2. Now I can move UP along the safe left wall toward the apple at (0, 9)\n3. This keeps me away from the enemy snake while maintaining a clear path to another easy point\n4. The left wall provides a protected corridor with minimal risk\n\nAfter this move, I'll be at (0, 1) and can continue moving UP each turn until I reach (0, 9) to collect the second apple. This gives me a clear 8-move plan to my next apple while staying completely safe from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP along the left wall toward (0, 9). The enemy snake is far away, so I can safely execute this multi-turn plan to collect the apple at the top-left corner.\n\nUP"

However, it does not bring me closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: This position is also empty, but similarly, it does not move me closer to the apple.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most strategic move at this point is to go **DOWN to (6, 6)**, which positions me directly below the apple at (6, 5) for my next turn. This also keeps me safe from collisions with my body and the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy Reminder\nMoving down keeps my options open for my next turn where I can aim to eat the apple at (6, 5).

After that, I could potentially go for the apples at (7, 2) or (6, 1) if the enemy snake doesn't interfere, or pivot toward (2, 1) if needed.\n\nDOWN"

Moving here will allow me to grow and score an additional point. Given that growing in size is beneficial and this move is available, it\u2019s the most advantageous option.\n  \n2. **DOWN to (5, 4)**: \n   - This is backtracking to my previous position at (5, 4), which is not allowed.\n  \n3. **LEFT to (4, 5)**: \n   - This position is unoccupied, but it does not help secure an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 5)**:\n   - This is backtracking, which is not a valid move.\n\n### Conclusion\nMoving UP to (5, 6) is the best move as it allows me to collect an apple and grow my snake, enhancing my score.

I need to avoid this area.\n\n### Move Choices\n1. **UP to (5, 6)**:\n   - **Result**: This position contains an apple, allowing me to grow. This is advantageous and a clear choice.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 4)**:\n   - **Result**: This move would take me back to my previous position, which is not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 5)**:\n   - **Result**: This position is unoccupied, but it doesn't lead to an apple and could bring me closer to the enemy snake if I continue moving horizontally.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 5)**:\n   - **Result**: This is a backwards move since it retraces my steps, making it invalid.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most advantageous move remains to move **UP to (5, 6)**, as it will allow me to grow my snake by collecting an apple. The potential for growth is crucial, especially since my current position is already surrounded by parts of the enemy snake and restricted in movement.\n\n### Future Move Strategy\nAfter moving to (5, 6), my next focus will be to navigate away from enemy threats and potentially head towards other apples while avoiding backtracking as much as possible.

The apple at (5, 6) has already been consumed.\n\n### Position of Enemy Snake\n- Enemy snake #0 remains at (5, 3), with its body making the corridor at x=4 dangerous. \n\n### Move Choices\n1. **UP to (5, 7)**:\n   - **Result**: This position is unoccupied and safe as it gets us closer to the safe area. However, there\u2019s no apple there.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 5)**:\n   - **Result**: This would retrace our movement back to our previous position, which is not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 6)**:\n   - **Result**: This position is unoccupied too, but it doesn't lead towards apples and might edge closer to the enemy snake's territory.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 6)**:\n   - **Result**: This position is now occupied by my snake's body (no backward moves allowed).\n\nGiven the options above, the most strategic move appears to be **UP to (5, 7)**. This move keeps my snake safe while avoiding dangerous areas near the enemy snake and allows for further strategic planning into areas that could potentially lead to more apples later.\n\n### Future Move Strategy\nAfter moving to (5, 7), my next focus will be to assess new potential moves, continue expanding away from the enemy, and look for opportunities towards apples in the next round. I need to keep a close eye on the enemy snake's possible movement and adjust accordingly to stay safe and avoid being cornered.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: **UP**."

DEATH.\n- DOWN to (5, 2) - This is empty space, safe move.\n- LEFT to (4, 3) - This would hit my own body. DEATH.\n- RIGHT to (6, 3) - This is empty space, safe move.\n\nSo I only have two safe options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLet me consider my strategic positioning:\n- The apple at (7, 2) is close - I could reach it by going RIGHT then DOWN\n- The apple at (6, 1) is also nearby - similar path\n- The enemy snake at (5, 6) with body extending down to (5, 4) is creating a wall effect, limiting my upward movement\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I'd be well-positioned to grab either (7, 2) or (6, 1) on subsequent moves. From (5, 2), I could go RIGHT to (6, 2) then either DOWN to (6, 1) for the apple, or RIGHT to (7, 2) for that apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 3), I'd also be well-positioned for the same apples, but I'd be moving closer to the enemy snake's territory.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the enemy snake position - they're at (5, 6) with body at [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)]. This means (6, 4) and (6, 5) are occupied by their body. If I go RIGHT to (6, 3), I'd be right next to their body segment at (6, 4), which could be risky if they move down.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5, 2) seems safer - it keeps me away from the enemy snake while still positioning me well for the nearby apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (5, 2), evaluate whether to go RIGHT toward (6, 2) to set up apple collection at (6, 1) or (7, 2), while monitoring enemy snake movement.\n\nDOWN"
