The enemy snake is at (0,1), and its head will move one cell this turn. My snake is at (9,7), so I need to avoid moves that would:\n1. Take me off the board (e.g., RIGHT from (9,7) would go to (10,7) \u2192 invalid).\n2. Collide with the enemy snake\u2019s head if it moves toward me.\n\n**Enemy Snake\u2019s Possible Moves (from (0,1))**:\n- UP: (0,2) \u2192 safe for me.\n- DOWN: (0,0) \u2192 safe for me.\n- LEFT: (-1,1) \u2192 invalid (off board), so enemy cannot move LEFT.\n- RIGHT: (1,1) \u2192 safe for me unless I move into (1,1) this turn.\n\n**My Possible Moves (from (9,7))**:\n- UP: (9,8) \u2192 valid (top edge, no collision risk).\n- DOWN: (9,6) \u2192 valid (no immediate collision).\n- LEFT: (8,7) \u2192 valid (no immediate collision).\n- RIGHT: (10,7) \u2192 invalid (off board).\n\nAll four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe for me this turn, as the enemy cannot reach me in one move from (0,1) to (9,7).\n\n#### **Apples Within Reach**\nApples are at:\n- (2,3), (5,5), (1,4), (7,6), (4,4).\n\n**Distance to Apples**:\n- (1,4): Manhattan distance = |9-1| + |7-4| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n- (2,3): |9-2| + |7-3| = 7 + 4 = 11.\n- (4,4): |9-4| + |7-4| = 5 + 3 = 8.\n- (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n- (7,6): |9-7| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe closest apple is at **(7,6)** (distance 3). Moving toward this apple is optimal.\n\n#### **Optimal Move**\nFrom (9,7), the best direction to move toward (7,6) is **LEFT** (since x decreases from 9 to 7, and y decreases from 7 to 6).\n- LEFT: (8,7) \u2192 closer to (7,6) (distance reduces to 2).\n- UP: (9,8) \u2192 moves away from (7,6) (distance remains 3).\n- DOWN: (9,6) \u2192 moves away from (7,6) (distance increases to 4).\n\n**LEFT** is the best choice to minimize distance to the closest apple while keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Goal**: Reach (7,6) in the next 2-3 turns to collect the closest apple.\n- **Avoid**: Getting trapped in corners or dead-ends. Since the board is large, focus on expanding toward the center or apples without blocking yourself.\n- **Enemy**: Snake #0 is at (0,1). It cannot reach me in 1 move, so no immediate threat. Prioritize apples over avoiding it unless it becomes a direct obstacle.\n- **Next Turns**: After collecting (7,6), I will have a body at (8,7) and (9,7). Ensure future moves do not collide with my own body or the enemy.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

However, the current state shows my head at (6,5), which suggests I did not collect the apple at (5,5) on Turn 4. This implies my last move was not DOWN to (5,5) but something else. Let me re-examine the last move.\n\n  **Reconstructing Last Move (Turn 4)**:\n  - On Turn 3, my head was at (6,6), body [(7,6), (8,6)] (length 3).\n  - On Turn 4, I moved DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5). This did not collect an apple (no apple at (6,5)), so my body remains [(7,6), (8,6)] (length 3). This contradicts the earlier rationale where I claimed to have collected an apple at (5,5). **Error in last move**: I did not collect an apple on Turn 4.\n\n  **Current State (Turn 5)**:\n  - Head: (6,5)\n  - Body: [(7,6), (8,6)] (length 3)\n  - Apples collected: 1 (from Turn 2)\n  - Apples remaining: (2,3), (5,5), (4,4), (5,0), (8,8)\n\n#### **Enemy Snake (ID 0)**\n- Head: (2,4)\n- Body: [(1,4)]\n- Apples collected: 1\n\n#### **Apples Remaining**\n- (5,5): Distance 1 from (6,5) (UP).\n- (4,4): Distance 3.\n- (2,3): Distance 5.\n- (5,0): Distance 6.\n- (8,8): Distance 5.\n\n#### **Safe Moves from (6,5)**\nPossible moves:\n- **UP**: (6,6) \u2192 Collides with my own body (segment at (7,6) is not adjacent, but (6,6) is not in my body. Wait, my body is [(7,6), (8,6)], so (6,6) is empty. **Valid**.\n- **DOWN**: (6,4) \u2192 Valid (no collision).\n- **LEFT**: (5,5) \u2192 Valid (apple at (5,5)).\n- **RIGHT**: (7,5) \u2192 Valid (no collision).\n\n#### **Optimal Move**\n- **LEFT to (5,5)** is the best choice because:\n  - It collects the closest apple (5,5), increasing my score to 2.\n  - It positions me well for future expansion (e.g., toward (4,4) or (5,0)).\n  - It avoids unnecessary movement away from the center.\n\n#### **Enemy Snake Movement (ID 0)**\n- Enemy snake at (2,4) will move this turn. Possible moves:\n  - **UP**: (2,5) \u2192 Safe for me.\n  - **DOWN**: (2,3) \u2192 Safe for me (apple at (2,3)).\n  - **LEFT**: (1,4) \u2192 Collides with its own body (segment at (1,4)). **Invalid**.\n  - **RIGHT**: (3,4) \u2192 Safe for me.\n- No immediate threat to me, but I should avoid blocking its path unless necessary.\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy**\n- After collecting (5,5), my body will be [(6,5), (7,6), (8,6)] (grown by 1 segment).\n- Next closest apple is (4,4) (distance 2 from (5,5)).\n- Plan to move toward (4,4) next, then toward (5,0) or (2,3) if needed.\n- Avoid moving into dead-ends or positions that limit future options.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Plan for Next Few Turns**\n1. **Turn 5**: Move LEFT to (5,5) and collect apple.
