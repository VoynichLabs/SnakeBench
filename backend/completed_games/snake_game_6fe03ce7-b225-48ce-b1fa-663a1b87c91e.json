After eating, my snake (length 2) will occupy (5, 5) and (6, 5). My tail will be at (6, 5), which is to the **East** of my head.\n- **LEFT path**: Move LEFT to (5, 4), then UP to (5, 5). After eating, my snake (length 2) will occupy (5, 5) and (5, 4). My tail will be at (5, 4), which is to the **South** of my head.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 5), the next closest target is likely (7, 6), which is to the North-East.\n- If I take the **UP path**, my tail at (6, 5) blocks the immediate RIGHT (East) move towards (7, 6). I would be forced to go UP (5, 6) first.\n- If I take the **LEFT path**, my tail at (5, 4) blocks DOWN (South). Since my next targets (7, 6), (4, 7), and (4, 8) are all North or horizontal, blocking South is much better than blocking East. The East direction remains open for a potentially more direct path to (7, 6) or just as an escape option.\n\nTherefore, approaching from the South (starting with LEFT) is strategically superior for future mobility. The enemy snake is at (1, 0), far away, and poses no immediate threat.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (5, 4), then UP to (5, 5) to eat the apple. Then proceed towards (7, 6).\n\nLEFT",
