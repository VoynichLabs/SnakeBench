The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple! That's a great opportunity to eat it immediately.\n   - Other apples are further away, so (5, 3) is the closest and most immediate target.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3). This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

Moving down is the safest and most efficient route to the next apple, as it does not put me in immediate danger of hitting the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nAfter moving down to (8, 4), I will be able to collect the apple there, and then I should consider my next move carefully, keeping in mind the enemy snake's position and potential future movements. It's important to avoid boxing myself in and to always leave an escape route.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID: 0) is currently at (4, 5) with a body segment at (5, 5) and (6, 5) and (6, 4). It's heading towards the tail, so it's not an immediate threat. However, I should be cautious not to move into its path on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the next move is:\n\n**DOWN**\n\nStrategy reminder for the next turn: After moving down to collect the apple at (8, 4), I should be aware of the enemy snake's planned trajectory. If it continues moving down towards its tail, I will have the opportunity to move left towards the apple at (1, 6) on the subsequent turn. Always keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjust the strategy to avoid a collision.\n\nThe next move is: **DOWN**",

The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple! That's a great opportunity to eat it immediately.\n   - Other apples are further away, so (5, 3) is the closest and most immediate target.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3). This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

However, moving down would result in a collision with Snake #0, which is currently at (4, 3).\n\nThe next closest apple is at (4, 9), which is to the left and up from the snake's current position. To get there, the snake must avoid the enemy snake and the walls. The best strategy would be to move left first, then up to collect the apple at (4, 9). After collecting this apple, the snake will have grown in length, and we can then consider the next move to collect another apple.\n\nSince there are no body parts to consider yet, we don't have to worry about the snake colliding with itself.

Since there is no immediate danger from the enemy snake or the walls, moving down to collect the apple at (8, 4) is the best course of action.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8, 4), I will need to decide on my next move. The enemy snake is currently moving horizontally, so I have a couple of safe options to consider for reaching the next apple. The apples available after (8, 4) are at (1, 6), (4, 9), (1, 9), and (8, 6). The most efficient apple to target next would be at (4, 9), as it is relatively close and in a safe location.\n\nTo reach the apple at (4, 9), I can move left from (8, 4) to (7, 4), then up to (4, 4), and finally right to (4, 9).

The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple! That's a great opportunity to eat it immediately.\n   - Other apples are further away, so (5, 3) is the closest and most immediate target.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3). This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

To get there, the snake must avoid the enemy snake and the walls. The best strategy would be to move left first, then up to collect the apple at (4, 9). After collecting this apple, the snake will have grown in length, and we can then consider the next move to collect another apple.\n\nSince there are no body parts to consider yet, we don't have to worry about the snake colliding with itself.

No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple! That's a great opportunity to eat it immediately.\n   - Other apples are further away, so (5, 3) is the closest and most immediate target.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3). This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

However, moving down would result in a collision with Snake #0, which is currently at (4, 3).\n\nThe next closest apple is at (4, 9), which is to the left and up from the snake's current position. To get there, the snake must avoid the enemy snake and the walls. The best strategy would be to move left first, then up to collect the apple at (4, 9). After collecting this apple, the snake will have grown in length, and we can then consider the next move to collect another apple.\n\nSince there are no body parts to consider yet, we don't have to worry about the snake colliding with itself.

Moving right (to (6, 8)) would only reduce the horizontal distance and not bring us closer to the apple in the vertical direction.\n\nHowever, moving down to (5, 7) is also safe and brings us closer to the apple. But we need to ensure that we don't get stuck or create a situation where we can't reach the apple efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6, 8) could be a good move to start reducing the horizontal distance to the apple at (8, 6). This would also open up the possibility of moving down in future turns to reach the apple.\n\nBut given that the apple is at (8, 6), moving right to (6, 8) and then down to (6, 7), (6, 6), and finally right to (8, 6) would be a valid path.\n\nBut moving down first to (5, 7) and then right to (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), and then down to (8, 6) would also work.\n\nBoth paths are valid, but moving right first might be more efficient as it reduces the horizontal distance first, which is larger (3 units right vs. 2 units down).\n\nBut looking at the current position, moving right to (6, 8) is safe and starts reducing the horizontal distance.\n\nBut let's check if moving down to (5, 7) is better:\n\nFrom (5, 7), the next move could be right to (6, 7), then right to (7, 7), then right to (8, 7), then down to (8, 6). This path is also valid and might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, from (5, 7), we could move right to (6, 7), then down to (6, 6), then right to (7, 6), then right to (8, 6). This is also valid.\n\nBoth paths are possible, but moving right first might be more efficient in terms of reducing the distance to the apple faster.\n\nBut let's consider the enemy snake at (9, 6). It's not immediately threatening, but if it starts moving towards the apple at (8, 6), we might want to reach it first.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6, 8) is a good move to start reducing the horizontal distance to the apple.\n\nBut let's also consider the other apples. The apple at (1, 9) is at the top-left corner, and the apple at (1, 6) is at the bottom-left corner. These are much further away, so focusing on the apple at (8, 6) is the best strategy for now.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate move is to go RIGHT to (6, 8) to start moving towards the closest apple at (8, 6).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

The enemy snake (Snake #0) is moving horizontally towards the left, with its head at (6, 8) after moving left from (7, 8).\n\nThe immediate goal is to collect the apple at (8, 6), which is to the left of my current position. Since there are no immediate threats from the enemy snake or the walls, and moving left will not put me in danger, the best course of action is to continue with the original plan to collect the apple at (8, 6) and then move to (8, 4) to collect the next apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apples at (8, 6) and (8, 4), I will have a clear path to move left towards the cluster of apples at (1, 6) and (1, 9). It's important to note that the enemy snake is moving horizontally and is currently at (6, 8), so it's not in a position to block my vertical movement towards the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 9). However, I should be cautious as the enemy snake could potentially change direction, so I need to keep an eye on its movements.\n\n**Strategy Reminder for Next Turn**: After collecting the apple at (8, 4), continue moving left towards the cluster of apples at (1, 6) and (1, 9). Monitor the enemy snake's movements to ensure it won't intercept your path. Be prepared to adjust your strategy to avoid a collision if the enemy snake's trajectory changes.\n\n**Next Move**: LEFT (to move to (8, 7) towards the apple at (8, 6)).",

The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple! That's a great opportunity to eat it immediately.\n   - Other apples are further away, so (5, 3) is the closest and most immediate target.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3). This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

To get there, the snake must avoid the enemy snake and the walls. The best strategy would be to move left first, then up to collect the apple at (4, 9).

The body is empty, so we're just the head right now.\n2. **Enemy Position**: Snake #1's head is at (5, 6). Since it's just the head, it's not blocking any immediate paths yet.\n3. **Apples**:\n   - (5, 3): This is directly to the right of our head (since increasing x is right). But wait, our head is at (4, 3), so right would be (5, 3). But (5, 3) is an apple!

This would land us on the apple at (5, 3), growing our length and gaining a point. This seems like the best immediate move.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 3). No apple there, and no immediate benefit.\n- **UP**: (4, 4). No apple there.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 2). No apple there.\n\n### Risks:\n- Moving right to (5, 3) is safe because:\n  - (5, 3) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y).\n  - There's no snake body at (5, 3) (only the apple is there).\n  - The enemy snake is at (5, 6), which is not adjacent to (5, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 3), our snake will have a body segment at (4, 3) and the head at (5, 3). Next moves will need to consider:\n- Avoiding collision with our own body (can't go left back to (4, 3)).\n- Possibly moving towards other apples, but prioritizing safety over distance.\n\n### Decision:\nThe immediate best move is to go RIGHT to eat the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",

Since the path leftwards is clear up to (8, 6), I can proceed with the move left.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8, 6), my next target will be the apple at (8, 4), which is another move to the left. This will maximize my score by collecting two apples in quick succession and position myself near the cluster of apples at (1, 6), (1, 9), and (4, 6) for subsequent moves.\n\nWith the path clear for the next move, I will proceed with the plan to head towards the apple at (8, 6).\n\nThe next move is: **LEFT** (to move to (8, 5)).\n\n**Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:** After moving left to (8, 5) and collecting the apple at (8, 6), the next step is to move left again to collect the apple at (8, 4). Continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements to ensure the path remains safe and be prepared to adjust the strategy if necessary to avoid a collision. After collecting the apple at (8, 4), evaluate the board to decide whether to continue left towards the cluster of apples or to move up towards the apple at (4, 6).",

Moving down (to (5, 7)) is a better strategic move because it directly reduces the vertical distance to the apple. Moving right (to (6, 8)) would only reduce the horizontal distance and not bring us closer to the apple in the vertical direction.\n\nHowever, moving down to (5, 7) is also safe and brings us closer to the apple. But we need to ensure that we don't get stuck or create a situation where we can't reach the apple efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6, 8) could be a good move to start reducing the horizontal distance to the apple at (8, 6). This would also open up the possibility of moving down in future turns to reach the apple.\n\nBut given that the apple is at (8, 6), moving right to (6, 8) and then down to (6, 7), (6, 6), and finally right to (8, 6) would be a valid path.\n\nBut moving down first to (5, 7) and then right to (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), and then down to (8, 6) would also work.\n\nBoth paths are valid, but moving right first might be more efficient as it reduces the horizontal distance first, which is larger (3 units right vs. 2 units down).\n\nBut looking at the current position, moving right to (6, 8) is safe and starts reducing the horizontal distance.\n\nBut let's check if moving down to (5, 7) is better:\n\nFrom (5, 7), the next move could be right to (6, 7), then right to (7, 7), then right to (8, 7), then down to (8, 6). This path is also valid and might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, from (5, 7), we could move right to (6, 7), then down to (6, 6), then right to (7, 6), then right to (8, 6). This is also valid.\n\nBoth paths are possible, but moving right first might be more efficient in terms of reducing the distance to the apple faster.\n\nBut let's consider the enemy snake at (9, 6). It's not immediately threatening, but if it starts moving towards the apple at (8, 6), we might want to reach it first.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (6, 8) is a good move to start reducing the horizontal distance to the apple.\n\nBut let's also consider the other apples. The apple at (1, 9) is at the top-left corner, and the apple at (1, 6) is at the bottom-left corner. These are much further away, so focusing on the apple at (8, 6) is the best strategy for now.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate move is to go RIGHT to (6, 8) to start moving towards the closest apple at (8, 6).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**",
