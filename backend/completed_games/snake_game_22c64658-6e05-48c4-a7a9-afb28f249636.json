The closest apple to me is at (4, 0) - directly below me (same x-coordinate, lower y)\n2. The enemy snake is at (4, 8) - directly above me (same x-coordinate, higher y)\n3. Both snakes are currently in the same column (x=4) with me between the enemy and the apple at (4,0)\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n1. UP (4,3): Safe - no body to hit, within bounds\n2. DOWN (4,1): Safe - no body to hit, within bounds\n3. LEFT (3,2): Safe - no body to hit, within bounds\n4. RIGHT (5,2): Safe - no body to hit, within bounds\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. Moving DOWN toward (4,0) apple is tempting but risky because:\n   - Enemy is directly above and might move down toward me\n   - If we both move toward each other, we could collide\n2. Moving UP would bring me closer to enemy - potentially dangerous\n3. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would be safer to avoid potential head-on collision\n\n**Best Option:**\nMoving RIGHT to (5,2) seems safest because:\n- It moves away from the vertical line with the enemy\n- Keeps me on the board with good future options\n- Doesn't immediately commit to any apple path\n- Avoids potential collision with enemy moving down\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFor the next few turns, I should:\n1. Move horizontally to create space between me and the enemy\n2. Then consider moving toward apples while maintaining safety\n3. Monitor enemy movements to avoid collisions\n\nRIGHT",

A . . 1 . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . A\n6 . . . . . . . . A .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . 0 . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . A . . .\n0 . . . . A . . . . .\n```\n- Your head is at (4, 8).\n- Enemy head is at (4, 2).\n- Apples are at (4, 0), (1, 8), (8, 6), (6, 1), (9, 7).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: From (4, 8), moving up would take you to (4, 7). Check if this is safe:\n   - Board boundary: (4, 7) is within bounds (y=7 is valid).\n   - Into your own body: No body yet, so no issue.\n   - Into enemy body: Enemy is at (4, 2), so no collision.\n   - Into apple: No apple at (4, 7).\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (4, 8), moving down would take you to (4, 9). Check if this is safe:\n   - Board boundary: (4, 9) is out of bounds (y=9 is the top, but y=9 is the top-right corner, which is valid since y ranges from 0 to 9). Wait, no: y=9 is the topmost row, which is valid. Wait, let's clarify: y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top. So (4,9) is valid.\n   - Into your own body: No body yet, so no issue.\n   - Into enemy body: Enemy is at (4, 2), so no collision.\n   - Into apple: No apple at (4, 9).\n   - Safe move.\n\n   Wait, no: y=9 is the topmost row, which is valid. So (4,9) is valid. But let's double-check: y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top. So (4,9) is valid. But let's look at the board: row 9 is the topmost row, which is row 9 in the board visualization. So (4,9) is valid. But let's check if it's safe.\n\n   Wait, let's look at the board again: the board is 10x10, with y=0 at bottom, y=9 at top. So (4,9) is valid. But let's check if it's safe:\n   - No body or enemy head there.\n   - So safe.\n\n   But let's think about the apple at (4,0). Moving down from (4,8) would take you to (4,9), which is not an apple. So no immediate gain.\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (4, 8), moving left would take you to (3, 8). Check if this is safe:\n   - Board boundary: (3, 8) is within bounds.\n   - Into your own body: No body yet, so no issue.\n   - Into enemy body: Enemy is at (4, 2), so no collision.\n   - Into apple: No apple at (3, 8).\n   - Safe move.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (4, 8), moving right would take you to (5, 8). Check if this is safe:\n   - Board boundary: (5, 8) is within bounds.\n   - Into your own body: No body yet, so no issue.\n   - Into enemy body: Enemy is at (4, 2), so no collision.\n   - Into apple: No apple at (5, 8).\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\nAll four directions are safe at this point since there is no body or enemy head to collide with.\n\n### Next Step: Eating Apples:\nNow, let's see which of these moves will lead to eating an apple in the next turn.\n\n- **UP**: (4,7) - No apple.\n- **DOWN**: (4,9) - No apple.\n- **LEFT**: (3,8) - No apple.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,8) - No apple.\n\nNone of these moves will immediately eat an apple. So we need to consider the long-term strategy.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\nSince there is no immediate apple to eat, we need to consider the following:\n1. **Avoiding enemy head**: The enemy is at (4,2). If we move in a way that the enemy can reach us in the next turn, we might get caught.\n   - Enemy can move up, down, left, or right from (4,2).\n   - If we move to (4,7) (UP), enemy can move down to (4,3) and then to (4,4) or (4,5) in the next turn, potentially colliding with us if we are at (4,7) and enemy moves to (4,7) next turn.\n   - Similarly, if we move to (3,8) (LEFT), enemy can move right to (5,2) and then potentially reach us.\n   - If we move to (5,8) (RIGHT), enemy can move up to (4,3) and then potentially reach us.\n   - If we move to (4,9) (DOWN), enemy can move up to (4,3) and then potentially reach us.\n\n   So, we need to avoid moves that allow the enemy to reach us in the next turn.\n\n2. **Avoiding future collisions**: We need to ensure that our path does not lead to a situation where the enemy can reach us or we get trapped.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move:\n- **UP (4,7)**:\n  - Enemy can move down to (4,3) and then to (4,4) or (4,5) next turn, but not directly to (4,7).\n  - However, if enemy moves up to (4,3) and then to (4,4) or (4,5), it might not directly reach us, but it's risky.\n  - Also, if we move up, we are moving away from the enemy's current position, but it's not a very safe move because the enemy can still reach us.\n\n- **DOWN (4,9)**:\n  - Moving down to (4,9) is a bit of a dead end, but it's safe.\n  - Enemy can move up to (4,3) and then to (4,4) or (4,5), but again, not directly to us.\n  - This move is somewhat safe but not ideal.\n\n- **LEFT (3,8)**:\n  - Moving left to (3,8) is a bit safer because the enemy is vertically aligned with us at (4,2).\n  - Enemy can move right to (5,2) and then potentially reach us if we are at (3,8) and enemy moves to (3,8) next turn.\n  - However, it's less likely to be directly reached.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,8)**:\n  - Moving right to (5,8) is also safe.\n  - Enemy can move up to (4,3) and then potentially reach us if we are at (5,8) and enemy moves to (5,8) next turn.\n  - This is also risky.\n\n### Considering Apples:\nThe apples are at (4,0), (1,8), (8,6), (6,1), (9,7). None of these are directly reachable from (4,8) in one move. However, moving towards the general area of these apples might be beneficial.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,8) is closer to the apple at (1,8) and (9,7).\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,8) is closer to the apple at (8,6) and (6,1).\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Avoid immediate enemy threats**: Since the enemy is at (4,2), moving LEFT to (3,8) is safer because it moves away from the enemy's vertical line.\n- **Keep options open**: Moving LEFT allows us to explore the left side of the board, which has apples at (1,8) and (9,7).\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving LEFT to (3,8) is a safer and more strategic move. It keeps us away from the enemy's current position and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT",

Its next possible moves are:\n     - UP: (4,1)\n     - DOWN: (4,3)\n     - LEFT: (3,2)\n     - RIGHT: (5,2)\n   - Your possible moves:\n     - LEFT: (1,8) \u2192 Enemy cannot reach (1,8) in one move (minimum Manhattan distance is 6).\n     - RIGHT: (3,8) \u2192 Enemy cannot reach (3,8) in one move (minimum distance is 6).\n     - UP: (2,7) \u2192 Enemy cannot reach (2,7) in one move (minimum distance is 5).\n     - DOWN: (3,8) \u2192 Same as RIGHT.\n\n   **Conclusion:** All moves are safe from enemy collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Proximity and Strategic Value**\n1. **Current Head Position:** (2,8)\n   - Closest apples:\n     - (1,8) \u2192 1 unit left (directly reachable).\n     - (9,7) \u2192 2 units right, 1 unit down (distance = 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.8).\n     - (4,0) \u2192 2 units left, 8 units down (distance = 2\u221a69 \u2248 9.3).\n     - (8,6) \u2192 6 units right, 2 units down (distance = 2\u221a29 \u2248 5.4).\n     - (6,1) \u2192 4 units right, 7 units down (distance = 2\u221a54 \u2248 7.3).\n\n   **Best immediate apple:** (1,8) (1 unit left).\n\n2. **Long-Term Path Expansion:**\n   - Moving LEFT to (1,8) directly consumes the closest apple, which is optimal for short-term gain.\n   - Moving RIGHT/DOWN/UP would delay apple consumption and risk enemy encroachment.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat Mitigation**\n- Enemy is at (4,2) and cannot reach any of your possible moves in one turn.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,8) pushes the enemy away from your potential path (since enemy\u2019s x=4 is far from x=1).\n- Moving RIGHT/DOWN/UP does not provide additional safety beyond what\u2019s already confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### **Follow-Up Moves After Apple Consumption**\n- If you move LEFT to (1,8) and eat the apple:\n  - Your body will now be [(1,8), (2,8)] (head at (1,8), tail at (2,8)).\n  - Next turn, you can safely move UP to (1,7) or RIGHT to (2,8) (but RIGHT would collide with tail).\n  - Best next move: UP to (1,7) to expand coverage toward (9,7) or (8,6).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**Prioritize eating the closest apple (1,8) while minimizing enemy risk.**\n**Move LEFT to (1,8).**\n\n---\n**UP, DOWN, LEFT**",

Watch enemy\u2019s head (4,2) and avoid direct paths toward it.\n3. **Long-Term (Turns 11+):** Focus on cornering the enemy or securing multiple apples in high-value areas. If enemy grows, prioritize blocking its path to your apples.\n4. **Risk Management:** Never move into your own tail or enemy\u2019s body.
