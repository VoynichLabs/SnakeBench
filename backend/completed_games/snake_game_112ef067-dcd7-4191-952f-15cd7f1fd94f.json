Let me analyze the available options:\n\n**Analyzing possible moves:**\n- UP: Would take me to (7, 7) - safe, gets me closer to the (6, 8) and (5, 9) apples\n- DOWN: Would take me to (7, 5) - that's where my body tail is now, I'd die\n- LEFT: Would take me to (6, 6) - safe, also positions me toward the upper apples\n- RIGHT: Would take me to (8, 6) - safe but moves me away from most apples\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nThe enemy snake is at (4, 8) and appears to be in the upper area where several apples are located: (0, 8), (5, 9), (6, 8). I need to be strategic about which apples to pursue.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n- (6, 8): Very close! Only 2 moves away if I go UP then LEFT\n- (5, 9): Also accessible, 3 moves away\n- (9, 8): On the right edge, relatively close\n- (0, 3) and (0, 8): Far away and enemy snake is closer to these\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\nMoving UP to (7, 7) is the best choice because:\n- It's safe - no collision risks\n- It positions me perfectly to grab the (6, 8) apple next turn with a LEFT move\n- The (6, 8) apple is closer to me than to the enemy snake\n- It keeps my options open for both (6, 8) and (5, 9) apples\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving to (7, 7), I should move LEFT to (6, 7), then UP to (6, 8) to capture that apple. I need to watch the enemy snake's movement to see if they're competing for the same apples, and be ready to pivot to the (9, 8) apple if needed.\n\nUP"

LEFT from (9, 8) would be (8, 8), which is where my body is now, so I'd die\n- RIGHT: Can't go right, I'm already at x=9 (the right wall)\n\nLet me reconsider the moves:\n- UP: (9, 9) - Safe but puts me in corner\n- DOWN: (9, 7) - Safe and moves toward apple at (9, 6)  \n- LEFT: (8, 8) - This is where my body is, so I'd die\n- RIGHT: Invalid (wall)\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\nDOWN is clearly the best move. It continues my strategy from last turn of collecting apples along the right edge. After moving to (9, 7), I can then move DOWN again next turn to (9, 6) to collect another apple.\n\nThe enemy snake is still on the left side of the board around (1, 9), so I'm not under immediate threat. The right edge strategy is working well.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** After moving to (9, 7), continue DOWN to (9, 6) to collect the apple there. Then I'll need to plan an escape route since I'll be getting close to the bottom-right area.\n\nDOWN"

Looking at the apple positions: (0, 3), (8, 2), (2, 2), (4, 0), (3, 7)\n\nThe apple at (8, 2) is quite close - only 3 moves away if I go LEFT then DOWN. The apple at (4, 0) is also accessible if I continue down the right edge.\n\nIf I continue DOWN to (9, 4), I maintain my territory along the right edge and could potentially reach the apple at (4, 0) by going down to (9, 0) then moving left.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), I start expanding into the center of the board and get closer to the apple at (8, 2).\n\nI think LEFT is the better strategic choice here. It opens up more of the board for me and gets me closer to multiple apples. The right edge will still be available to retreat to if needed, and the enemy snake is far away on the left side.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (8, 5), continue working toward the apple at (8, 2) by moving DOWN toward row 2, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and maintaining escape routes.\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 0) is still very attractive - only 2 moves left to reach the same x-coordinate, then 2 moves down.\n\nThe enemy snake at (1, 2) is quite close horizontally but they have a massive body that limits their movement options. They're likely targeting the (2, 2) apple since it's closest to them.\n\n**Tactical Decision:**\nI should continue moving LEFT toward (5, 2). This keeps me on the optimal path to reach (4, 0), and I can still pivot to (3, 1) if needed. Moving DOWN now would be premature since I'm not yet at the optimal x-coordinate for the bottom apples.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue LEFT to (5, 2), then reassess whether to go for (4, 0) or (3, 1) based on enemy movement. The enemy snake's large body should limit their ability to quickly reach the bottom apples.\n\nLEFT"

If I move LEFT to (4, 1), I'd be getting closer to their position, but I'd also be positioning myself to grab either the (4, 0) or (3, 1) apple.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have two excellent apple opportunities very close by:\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 1), then I can either:\n   - Go LEFT again to (3, 1) to grab that apple immediately\n   - Go DOWN to (4, 0) to grab that apple\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 2), so if I go to (4, 1), I'm not in immediate collision danger since we'd be on different y-coordinates.\n\n**My choice:** Move LEFT to (4, 1). This positions me perfectly to grab either nearby apple on my next turn, and I can assess which one is safer based on enemy movement.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** From (4, 1), grab whichever apple is safer - either LEFT to (3, 1) or DOWN to (4, 0). Monitor enemy snake position to avoid collision.\n\nLEFT"
