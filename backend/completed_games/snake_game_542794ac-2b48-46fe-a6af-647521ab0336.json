We gotta make some aggressive plays right now, turn 0!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Our position (ID 0):** (8, 3). We are a tiny little one-segment snake, baby!\n*   **Rival position (ID 1):** (5, 5). Also small.\n*   **Apples:** We have a bunch of apples scattered around. The closest ones to us are (8, 4) and (9, 1). The one at (8, 4) is literally one move away if we go UP.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK & MOVE EVALUATION (Our Head: (8, 3))**\n\nWe are looking for safe moves that also set us up for success. Remember, Snake #1 is at (5, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. We are moving onto an apple! A *fantastic* first move.\n    *   **Collision risk:** Our opponent (5, 5) would have to move 3 spots to the right and 1 spot down to hit us. Impossible in one turn.\n    *   **Outcome:** EAT APPLE! Win points! Grow!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Next to an apple at (8, 1).\n    *   **Collision risk:** Low.\n    *   **Outcome:** Sets us up for (8, 1) next turn, but UP gets us an apple NOW.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Collision risk:** Low.\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves toward the center, but away from the closest apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Collision risk:** Low.\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves towards the (9, 1) apple.\n\n**RIVAL ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (5, 5))**\n\nWhere is Snake #1 likely to go? They also want apples! The closest apples to them are:\n*   (4, 6) - UP, LEFT\n*   (5, 8) - UP, UP, UP\n*   (7, 7) - RIGHT, UP, UP\n\nIf they go:\n*   UP: (5, 6) - good move towards (5, 8) or (4, 6).\n*   DOWN: (5, 4) - less good, less apples nearby.\n*   LEFT: (4, 5) - good move towards (4, 6).\n*   RIGHT: (6, 5) - towards (7, 7).\n\nWe are far apart right now, so collision is not a major concern yet.\n\n**STRATEGY PICK:**\n\nThe move UP is a no-brainer. It scores us an apple immediately at (8, 4), giving us the early lead and lengthening our snake! Why wait when you can eat now, fam? We need to get big fast so we can start boxing this guy in later.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Grab the apple at (8, 4) this turn. Then, we should probably swing down for (8, 1) or (9, 1). Let's maximize our local apple grab before engaging Snake #1. We're going for the early lead dominance! LET'S GO FOR THE SNACK!\n\nUP",

The board has apples at several positions, but the most immediate opportunities are (5,8), (4,6), and (8,4). I must ensure every move keeps my snake alive and sets me up for future gains.\n\n1) **UP (5,6):** Moving UP directly targets the (5,8) apple in two moves. The path is clear, with no obstacles or opponent proximity. This direction allows me to grow vertically and reach an apple efficiently. \n\n2) **LEFT (4,5):** This heads toward the (4,6) apple, but requires a turn afterward. While possible, the path isn't as direct as moving UP. The opponent might interfere if they move west, but with their head at (8,3), the immediate risk is low.\n\n3) **RIGHT (6,5):** Approaching (8,4) eventually, but it's farther and requires more turns. The apple at (5,8) is actually closer than (8,4), making UP more efficient.\n\n4) **DOWN (5,4):** Moving away from key apples like (5,8) and (4,6), which doesn\u2019t align with priority targets. This direction risks falling into a less optimal route.\n\n**Decision Breakdown:**  \n- **UP** offers the most straightforward path to my closest apple (5,8) without requiring turns or detours. The opponent\u2019s position at (8,3) makes it unlikely they\u2019d interfere on this path. Staying safe and focusing on vertical growth is the priority. \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \n- Prioritize the (5,8) apple. After reaching it, assess new targets based on remaining apples and opponent movements. Avoid clustering my snake near edges to prevent traps.\n\n**Future Me Note:** Keep pressing UP to secure the apple at (5,8), then pivot east/north toward (7,7) or other targets. Stay alert for opponent\u2019s movements\u2014they might try to cut me off near that apple, so flexibility matters.\n\n**MOVE: UP**",

How we feeling about that early lead, fam?!\n\n### LIVE Turn 1 Analysis (The Boxer's Stance)\n\nOur goal is not just apples, it's global domination! We need to grow, secure a local territory, and then swoop in to cut off Snake #1. Speaking of which, where'd he go?\n\n**Current State Review:**\n*   **Your Head (ID 0):** (8, 4). Tail (T): (8, 3). Length: 2.\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (5, 6). Length: 1 (He successfully moved UP from (5, 5)).\n*   **Next Closest Apples to Us:**\n    1.  (9, 1) - 4 moves away (R, D, D, D)\n    2.  (8, 1) - 3 moves away (D, D, D)\n    3.  (7, 7) - 4 moves away (L, U, U, U)\n    4.  (3, 2) - 6 moves away (L, L, L, D, D)\n\n### Strategy Check & Move Evaluation (Our Head: (8, 4))\n\nWe're in a great position on the right side. We should continue to harvest these right-side apples while keeping an eye on our rival, who is moving up the center lane.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No self-collision, no wall collision.\n    *   **Forward progress:** Moves us further into the top-right corner, potentially toward the (8, 7) apple.\n    *   **Rival Risk:** Snake 1 is at (5, 6). No immediate threat.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. This is our tail segment (T)! Moving backwards into the tile we just left is a guaranteed self-collision because we grew. WE ARE NOT HITTING OUR TAIL! ELIMINATED.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Forward progress:** Moves us toward the center of the board and potential conflict with Snake #1.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Forward progress:** Moves us toward the right edge and the (9, 1) apple zone.\n\n**The \"Battle Plan\" Move:**\n\nIf we go UP to (8, 5), we set ourselves up to collect the (8, 7) apple in two more turns (U, U). We are prioritizing vertical movement right now to clear the apples away from the top-right.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9, 4), we set ourselves up to sweep down the right wall to get (9, 1). This is also excellent.\n\nLet's look at Snake #1 (5, 6).\n*   He's probably targeting (4, 6) or (5, 8).\n*   If he goes LEFT to (4, 6): He gets an apple.\n*   If he goes UP to (5, 7): He continues toward (5, 8).\n\nSince we are still far, we should maximize our uncontested growth. Going RIGHT keeps us on the *exterior* of the board, which is generally safer for a longer period, minimizing early entanglement risks. It also positions us for the (9, 1) and (9, 0) apples.\n\nLet's go RIGHT to secure the right flank! We\u2019re going down the coast, grabbing every apple!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Turn 2:\n\nAfter moving to (9, 4), we will be looking to move DOWN to (9, 3) and then chase (9, 1). If the rival is still hanging around the center, we will complete our right-side sweep before moving toward (7, 7) or crossing the board. Grow fast, stay safe! Box the rival in later when we are longer!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at that Scoreboard: Us 1, Rival 0. EZ clap so far! \ud83e\udd23\n\nLet's check the board and see what our rival, Snake #1, is trying to pull.\n\n### LIVE Turn 2 Status Check (The Flanking Maneuver)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 4)\n*   Body: [(8, 4)]\n*   Tail: (8, 4) (Wait, no, the tail is now (8, 4) since we grew to 2 segments. The body is always HEAD-TO-TAIL. The last segment is the tail. If we moved right to (9, 4) from (8, 4) and grew, our body list still includes the segment we just left, (8, 4). The *old* tail vanished, and (8, 4) became the new tail. Let's re-read the body description: *Body: [(8, 4)]*. Since we grew, the original tail is now the first body segment, and since we just ate, we grew from 1 to 2 segments. Head at (9, 4). The tail is indeed (8, 4) for this turn calculation. Wait, the problem set says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" The body list is separate. Head (9, 4), Body [(8, 4)]. Length 2. The tail segment is (8, 4).\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 7)\n*   Body: None. Length 1.\n\n**Key Apples:**\nWe're right next to the boundary, ready to sweep down.\n1.  (9, 1) - 3 moves away (D, D, D)\n2.  (8, 7) - 6 moves away (L, L, U, U, U)\n3.  (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0) - Far, but crucial territory.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake 0 (Head: (9, 4))\n\nWe need to continue our mission to clear the right side and establish dominance here before the rival gets too long.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Moves us toward the (8, 7) apple, but going up the wall takes us away from the immediate (9, 1) target.\n    *   **Prognosis:** Good for securing the top right later, but perhaps less efficient now.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Perfect! This is exactly the longitudinal path we planned. It takes us directly down the wall toward the (9, 1), (9, 0), and (8, 1) apples. We can gobble up the corner.\n    *   **Prognosis:** Excellent. High priority apple acquisition.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. This is our tail segment! Hitting your own body is a big NO-NO, especially when you are only length 2. We'd crash right into our body segment (8, 4). Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. Off the board (9x9 max coords). Wall crash! Eliminated! \ud83d\udca5\n\n### Rival Prediction (Head: (5, 7))\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 7) and looking pretty centralized, positioned between the top apples.\n*   **Target (5, 8)?** If they go UP to (5, 8), they get an apple. This is the most likely move.\n*   **Target (4, 6)?** If they go LEFT to (4, 7), then D to (4, 6), that's less direct.\n*   **Target (7, 7)?** This is far (R, R, U).\n\nI predict Snake #1 goes UP to (5, 8) and grabs that apple. If they do, they will be length 2, and their tail will be at (5, 7).\n\n### The Chosen Move and Strategy\n\nThe best move for us is unequivocally **DOWN** to (9, 3). It maintains the coastal sweep strategy, is perfectly safe, and puts us in range of multiple apples (9, 1) and (9, 0).\n\nWe need to get long fast and build up our safe zone on the right side. Our rival will likely grow to length 2 this turn. We need to stay competitive!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Turns (The Right-Side Sweep)\n\nNext turns: (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1)! Grab that sweet apple. After securing the (9, 1) apple, we will decide whether to go for (9, 0) and (8, 1) or pivot inward towards the center. The key is to get to at least length 4 or 5 before engaging Snake 1. Efficiency and safety first! We are securing this entire vertical flank! LET'S GO CHAT! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We dove right down the wall, and now we are positioned for the full right-side sweep! The scoreboard is tied, 1-1, but we have the momentum! Snake #1 (the rival) definitely snatched that apple above him, confirming my prediction.\n\n### LIVE Turn 3 Status Check (The Coastal Sweep Continues)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 3)\n*   Body: [(9, 4)]\n*   Length: 2 segments.\n*   Goal: Proceed immediately to the (9, 1) apple.\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 8) (Confirmed the move to grab the apple at (5, 8)).\n*   Body: [(5, 7)]\n*   Length: 2 segments.\n*   Goal: Probably heading toward (7, 7) or (8, 7) or maybe trying to sneak into the (4, 6) area. They are very centralized!\n\n**Key Apples:**\n1.  **(9, 1):** Our primary target. One move away (DOWN). \ud83d\udd25\n2.  **(9, 0) / (8, 1):** Secondary targets for the right flank cleanup.\n3.  **(7, 7):** A tempting target for the rival.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake 0 (Head: (9, 3))\n\nWe are in a perfect position. We just need to stay safe and grab that 9, 1 apple and solidify our position on the whole right flank.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. This is our body segment! We just came from (9, 4) in Turn 1, and since we just grew by 1, (9, 4) is now our tail! Crashing into our body on a length 2 snake is the ultimate fumble. Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Moves us one step closer to the glorious **(9, 1)** apple. This path is secure, keeps us on the wall, and prepares us for the next score.\n    *   **Prognosis:** Excellent. High priority move.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Moving away from the current apple goal. It opens the lane to the middle, but we've committed to the right wall sweep. We risk giving up the (9, 1) apple to the rival if they make a crazy run, which is unlikely but possible.\n    *   **Prognosis:** Less optimal than DOWN; save this for after we clear the corner.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. Off the board (9x9 max coords). Wall crash! Eliminated! \ud83d\udca5\n\n### Rival Prediction (Head: (5, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 8) and is looking like they might push toward the top right or the center.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (5, 9) (Apple A):** This would be an immediate apple grab. Very likely.\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (6, 8):** Pushing toward (7, 7) or (8, 7). This is a strong move for a central snake.\n*   **Option C: DOWN to (5, 7):** Fatal, hitting their own body (tail).\n*   **Option D: LEFT to (4, 8):** Good for exploring the top-left area.\n\nTargeting (5, 9) is the cleanest apple grab, so I predict they go **UP**. If they go UP, they will be at length 3, and their tail will be at (5, 7).\n\n### Head-On Collision Check\n\nWe are at (9, 3) moving to (9, 2). They are at (5, 8) moving to (5, 9) or (6, 8). There is absolutely no risk of a head-on collision or crashing into their body. Our sweep path is totally isolated for now, which is perfect for farming length!\n\n### The Chosen Move and Strategy\n\nThe best move is clearly **DOWN** to (9, 2). It sets us up for the immediate apple grab next turn! We must maximize our length advantage before we decide to pivot into the battlefield. Consistency and safety are key in these early turns! We are going for the three-piece on this corner! GET TILTED, RIVAL!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Turns (The Corner Domination)\n\nNext Move: DOWN to (9, 2).\nTurn 4 Prediction: DOWN to (9, 1) to grab the apple! Our length will be 3. Tail at (9, 4).\nTurn 5 Prediction: Move RIGHT to (9, 0) (Apple) or LEFT/DOWN based on the next apple drop. Clearing this corner is paramount! We need to get to length 5 or 6 before we start worrying about boxing them in. The map is too open right now.\n\nDOWN",

Let's recheck: *Body: [(5, 8)]*. No, the body starts with the segment immediately following the head.\n\n*Correction Check on Body:*\nTheir Head is (6, 8). Their body is [(5, 8)]. The segment *behind* the head is (5, 8). So, if they move LEFT to (5, 8), they hit their own body and die.\n\nTherefore, their safe options are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\nIf they are aiming for the central apples, I predict they go **RIGHT** to (7, 8) to contest the (7, 7) or (8, 7) apple.\n\n### Head-On Collision Check\n\nWe are at (9, 2) moving to (9, 1).\nThey are at (6, 8) moving to (7, 8) (predicted).\nWe are nowhere near each other. Our move is safe, guaranteed points, and sets up for more points. This is how we build the winning difference!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Corner Clean-up and Pivot)\n\nCurrent Move: DOWN to (9, 1) [Apple]. New length 3. Tail at (9, 3).\n\nNext Turn (Turn 5): We will be at (9, 1).\nTargets: (9, 0) Apple.\nOptimal Move: Assuming we are safe, we move DOWN again to (9, 0) for the third apple in a row! Length 4. Tail at (9, 2).\n\nTurn 6: We will be at (9, 0).\nTargets: (8, 1) Apple.\nOptimal Move: LEFT to (8, 0). Then UP to (8, 1) for the next apple, or if the (8, 1) apple is gone, we start moving into the center from the lower right flank.\n\nDominate the corner, secure the length advantage, then pivot and box the rival! LET'S GO, CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

That last move was an apple grab, and now we are positioned perfectly to snag another one! We're building a monster! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n### LIVE Turn 5 Status Check (The Apple Harvest Continues)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 1) - Just ate! Length 3.\n*   Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3)]\n*   Apples collected: 2\n*   Goal: Secure the (9, 0) apple right below us! This is the execution phase of the Coastal Sweep!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 8) - *WAIT!* They moved RIGHT from (6, 8) to (7, 8), just as we predicted! Nice read, Chat!\n*   Body: [(6, 8)]\n*   Apples collected: 1 (Length 2)\n*   Goal: They are squarely aiming for those high-y apples like (8, 7) or (7, 7). They are setting themselves up to fight for the center. We love it!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake 0 (Head: (9, 1))\n\nWe have the (9, 0) apple squarely in our sights. Do we take the guaranteed points? ABSOLUTELY!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. This is our body segment! We just came from here! We are not going backward! Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 0): (The Apple!)**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Immediate apple, +1 length, +1 score. Completes the first corner clean-up. Sets up for the pivot movement toward the (8, 1) apple. This is the optimal move.\n    *   **Prognosis:** PERFECT. Double-apple moves are how we run away with this lead!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Moves directly toward the (8, 1) apple, which is great, BUT we forgo the guaranteed (9, 0) apple. We should clear the closest, safest targets first. Postponement is not domination!\n    *   **Prognosis:** Not optimal; postpones guaranteed points.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. Off the board. Wall crash! Eliminated! \ud83d\udca5\n\nThe move is CLEAR. We are diving **DOWN** to (9, 0)! This will bring us to a length of 4!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Head: (7, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8). Where are they going?\n\n*   Possible Apples: (7, 7) and (8, 7). They are now closer to both.\n*   **UP to (7, 9):** Safe, no reward.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 7):** Safe, and an apple! This is the most logical move. They secure the (7, 7) point.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe. Positions them for the (8, 7) apple next turn. This is also a strong possibility if they want to get slightly higher.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):** FATAL. Hitting their own body! Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n\nPrediction: They go **DOWN** to (7, 7) for the apple. This makes them length 3.\n\n### Collision Check and Strategy Modification\n\nIf we go DOWN to (9, 0) and they go DOWN to (7, 7), we are nowhere near a collision. They are 2 full columns and 7 rows away from us! Safety confirmed.\n\nOur strategy is to secure the corner, and then angle inward.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Mid-Game Pivot)\n\nCurrent Move: DOWN to (9, 0) [Apple]. New length 4. Tail at (9, 3).\n\nNext Turn (Turn 6): We will be at (9, 0).\nTargets: (8, 1) Apple, (4, 0) Apple, and the general bottom row.\nTo get to (8, 1) quickly, we move **LEFT** to (8, 0).\n\nTurn 7: We will be at (8, 0).\nTargets: (8, 1) Apple.\nOptimal Move: **UP** to (8, 1) for the fourth apple! Length 5.\n\nTurn 8: We will be at (8, 1).\nTargets: (4, 0) apple, (4, 4) apple.\nOptimal Move: Start hugging the bottom wall LEFT toward (4, 0).\n\nThe plan is simple: complete the right-hand corner clean-up, establish a massive lead, and then move aggressively into the lower-middle territory to box the opponent if they hug the center too long! We are playing chess, Chat, not checkers! Who's ready for a hat trick of apples?! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We aim to be length 5 soon!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 7) - *WAIT!* Just as predicted, they moved DOWN to (7, 7) and got an apple! Nice read, Chat! They are now length 3.\n*   Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8)]\n*   Apples collected: 2 (Length 3)\n*   Goal: They look like they are aiming for that (8, 7) apple next, or maybe trying to move further into the center.

Off the board! Wall crash! Eliminated! \ud83d\udca5\n\n4.  **LEFT to (8, 0): (The Pivot!)**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** Moves us one closer to the (8, 1) apple. It keeps our options open and positions us perfectly for the next turn. This move is necessary to break out of the corner.\n    *   **Prognosis:** Optimal maneuver.\n\nThe move is CLEAR. We are pivoting **LEFT** towards the center!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Head: (7, 7))\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7). Where are they going?\n\n*   Possible Apples: (8, 7). That seems like the most logical target.\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** FATAL. This is their body segment! They just came from there! Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe, but no immediate reward.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe, and an apple! This is the most logical move. They secure the (8, 7) point.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe, but no immediate reward.\n\nPrediction: They go **RIGHT** to (8, 7) for the apple. This would make them length 4.\n\n### Collision Check and Strategy Modification\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (8, 0) and they go **RIGHT** to (8, 7):\n*   We end up at (8, 0). **Safe.**\n*   They end up at (8, 7). **Safe.**\n*   We are still 7 squares apart vertically. No immediate collision danger. The plan is sound.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (The Apple Train)\n\nCurrent Move: LEFT to (8, 0). New location (8, 0). Length 4. Tail at (9, 3).\n\nNext Turn (Turn 7): We will be at (8, 0).\nTarget: (8, 1) Apple.\nOptimal Move: **UP** to (8, 1) for the fourth apple! Length 5.\n\nTurn 8: We will be at (8, 1).\nTarget: (4, 0) Apple. The best way to get there is to continue hugging the bottom wall.\nOptimal Move: **LEFT** to (7, 1) or perhaps **DOWN** to (8, 0) if (7, 1) is too risky. But we should be focused on getting further left. If we go LEFT to (7, 1), we can then go DOWN/LEFT to (4, 0).\n\nThe strategy remains: clear the remaining bottom-row apples (we missed a few!) and build an uncatchable lead! We are positioning perfect for that (8, 1) apple next turn! LET'S GET THIS W!

We pivoted **LEFT** to (8, 0) and now we are staring directly at that juicy (8, 1) apple! LET'S SECURE THIS LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### LIVE Turn 7 Status Check - The Race to Five!\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 0)\n*   Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]\n*   Apples collected: 3 (Length 4)\n*   Goal: UP to (8, 1) to grab that 4th apple and extend our lead!\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 7) - **CRUSHED IT!** They went RIGHT and got the apple at (8, 7). Smart move by them, but we're about to outscore them!\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8)]\n*   Apples collected: 3 (Length 4)\n*   Goal: They're boxed in the top-right corner near the edge, maybe aiming for (5, 9) or (4, 6) next. The board is ours down low!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake 0 (Head: (8, 0))\n\nWe are at (8, 0). The apple is at (8, 1). This is a simple move, but we must check for collisions!\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1): (The Apple Move!)**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! No body parts there. Off the board is safe. Board: (8, 1) is a clear apple square. **This is the money move!**\n    *   **Benefit:** +1 Apple, +1 Length. Dominating the scoreboard!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, -1):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. Off the board! Eliminated! \ud83d\udca5\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** FATAL. That's our body segment! We just came from the column next to this, but (9, 0) is still part of our current body list: `[(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]`. Moving into your own body? NOPE! Eliminated! \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Benefit:** None immediately, keeps us moving along the bottom wall, but misses an easy apple. Why would we do this? We wouldn't!\n\nThe decision is crystal clear, Chat! We are going **UP** for the apple!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Head: (8, 7))\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 7). Where can they go?\n\n*   Possible Apples nearby at (5, 9), (0, 7), (4, 6).\n*   **UP to (8, 8):** Safe. No apple.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe, but they're cutting themselves off from a lot of the board.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** FATAL! That is their body segment! They cannot go LEFT!\n\nTheir most logical move is either **UP** or perhaps **RIGHT** to explore the edge, but they need to turn away from their body. They are not close to any immediate conflict with us. We are safe to move!\n\nPrediction: Snake 1 goes **UP** to (8, 8) to secure space, or **RIGHT** to hug the wall. Either way, they are fine, and we are fine.\n\n### Collision Check and Strategy Modification\n\nWe move **UP** to (8, 1). Snake 1 likely moves **UP** to (8, 8).\n*   We both end up safe and collect our respective apples (we already accounted for their collect last turn, so this turn, they are searching).\n*   The key is we get Apple #4, giving us a 4-3 lead! \ud83e\udd47\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Mid-Field Domination)\n\nTurn 8: We will be at (8, 1). Length 5.\nTarget: The next closest safe apples are (4, 0) or (2, 0) or maybe the cluster on y=3/y=2.\nOptimal Move: We need to turn LEFT/DOWN to get to the lower quadrant. From (8, 1), moving **LEFT** to (7, 1) seems like the next logical step to sweep the bottom.\n\nThe overall strategy is still: sweep the bottom/center, build length, and force our opponent into cramped spaces or corners. We are going for the gold, baby!\n\nUP",
