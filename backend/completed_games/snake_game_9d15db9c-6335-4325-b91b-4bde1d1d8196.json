Moving right would bring me closer to the apple at (6, 5), but it also brings me closer to snake #2. On the other hand, moving left would take me away from both the apple and snake #2. However, since the goal is to have the most points, I should prioritize the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apples while avoiding collisions with other snakes and the walls.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

However, I should be careful not to run into the enemy snake #1 which is at (9, 3) and moving towards my direction. I will also keep an eye on the apple at (1, 7) as I might accidentally eat it and shorten myself if I'm not careful.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move down towards the apple at (6, 0) while avoiding the enemy snake #1.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
