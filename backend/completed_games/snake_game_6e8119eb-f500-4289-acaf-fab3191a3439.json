Taking an apple now is good: it increases my score and gives me more control of nearby apple clusters.\n- Enemy head is at (5,7). They cannot reach either (7,6) or (7,4) in one move, so moving to either apple this turn won't cause an immediate head-on collision.\n- Between UP and DOWN, UP (to (7,6)) keeps me well-positioned to reach another nearby apple at (8,6) next turn and offers three escape options (left, right, or up) after growth. DOWN (to (7,4)) is similar, but I slightly prefer UP because it moves toward the cluster at (8,6)/(6,8) and is farther from the enemy's most direct approach route from (5,7).\n- Therefore I will take the apple at (7,6) by moving UP.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- After eating at (7,6), consider moving to (8,6) to chain apples if safe. Avoid moving back into my previous cell (illegal into own body). Watch enemy moves from around (5,7) \u2014 if they head toward my side, avoid getting boxed in; prioritize maintaining 2\u20133 open escape directions each turn.\n\nUP",

Good safety, but forgoes the immediate apple at (6,3).\n- LEFT (5,4): moves toward left apples but is one step farther from the immediate apple at (6,3).

Enemy snake is far (around (3,9)) so no head-on threat this turn.\n\nChoice\n- Take the apple at (6,3). It's safe and increases my lead.

Avoid turning back into my neck; keep routes open to the center/left so I don't get boxed by my own tail.\n\nDOWN",

Choosing RIGHT risks getting funneled and reduces quick access to the dense apples on x=2 and the bottom row.\n- DOWN to (3,0): safe and gives access to bottom-row apples (1,0 and 5,0 are reachable), but it delays grabbing the nearby x=2 apple cluster and is slightly less central for quickly collecting multiple apples.\n- LEFT to (2,1): safe, keeps multiple exits (up to (2,2) then (2,3) apple, left/down to bottom apples, or back to (3,1) later). It gives the shortest path to the x=2 apples at (2,3) and (2,5) and keeps me away from my own body wall on the right.

No enemy head can reach x=0 in one move, so there is no head-on contest for that apple.\n- RIGHT is legal but puts me closer to the enemy\u2019s long, crowded body where I risk being boxed in or head-on later.\n\nStrategic reasoning:\n- Grabbing (0,9) now ties me with the opponent at 13 apples and keeps me on the safe left column with good escape options along the top row. From (0,9) I can then take (1,9) next turn and reassess the board with a favorable score parity.\n- Moving RIGHT now gains no clear immediate advantage and increases the chance of getting trapped by the enemy\u2019s body cluster. I prefer to stay on the open edge, collect uncontested apples, and only move into the center when I can do so without getting boxed.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns:\n- Take the apple at (0,9) this turn, then take (1,9) if still available. After those, evaluate enemy movement and choose a safe route to the nearby apples at (2,8) and (3,8) or peel back down into the board if the center is less crowded. Always avoid moves that reduce my available escape options.\n\nUP",

It cannot reach either (5,9) or (4,8) in one turn, so no immediate head-on threat this turn.\n- However, (4,8) sits closer to the dense enemy cluster around x=4\u20138, y=5\u20138. Dropping down now (to take the apple at 4,8) would put me inside that tight area and increase the chance of getting boxed in or colliding with enemy body in upcoming turns.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- RIGHT to (5,9) preserves open space along the top row, keeps multiple escape options (I can continue east to (8,9) apple or later drop down from a safer approach), and avoids stepping directly into the enemy cluster.\n- Down to (4,8) would give an immediate apple, but it would also bring me into cramped terrain with many enemy body segments nearby and fewer safe follow-ups. Preserving space is more valuable than one extra apple now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Continue east along the top row toward the apple at (8,9) while monitoring enemy head movement.

If the enemy starts shifting right rapidly (unlikely given current positions), I may stall or sidestep, but for now proceeding down is best.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (9,8) now.\n- Continue down the right column toward (9,6) to pick that apple, then reassess whether to continue to (9,3) or circle to safer open space depending on enemy motion.\n- Always avoid re-entering my own narrow loop and keep options to move left only if the adjacent squares are clearly safe.\n\nDOWN",

Always prioritize staying on open edges and keeping multiple escape options.\n\nDOWN",

Eating it is safe this turn (no enemy head nearby to contest).\n  - Will increase my length again (I ate last turn too, so my tail will not move this turn if I eat).\n  - After moving to (7,4) I'll have good options: LEFT to (6,4) (apple), DOWN to (7,3) (apple), or RIGHT/UP for escape routes. This collects immediate points and keeps multiple follow-ups open in the apple cluster at (6,4),(6,6),(5,5),(7,3).\n  - No immediate head-on risk from the enemy (enemy head at (1,1) is far).\n\n- LEFT -> (6,5)\n  - Empty cell, moves toward apples at (6,6),(5,5),(6,4).\n  - Does not gain an apple immediately, so my tail would advance next turn (freeing space behind me).\n  - Keeps more lateral mobility and delays growth, which can help avoid tight-space trapping, but misses an immediate nearby apple.\n\n- UP -> (7,6)\n  - Empty cell but edges me toward crowded top-area bodies (enemy segments in the y=7..8 zone and my own body along the top), giving somewhat tighter future geometry.\n  - No immediate apple; slower progress on collecting apples.\n\n3) Tactical choice\n- The board currently has many nearby apples. Grabbing (7,4) now is high value: it's safe, immediately increases my apple count (important since scores are tied), and leaves several nearby apples accessible while keeping multiple escape options. The enemy is far and unlikely to contest these apples this turn.\n- I accept the temporary extra length (tail not moving because I ate last turn and will not move again if I eat now) because the local area has ample free space and follow-up apples to continue moving without being boxed in.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (7,4) now (DOWN).\n- Then prioritize (6,4) or (7,3) to chain apples; maintain routes that keep me away from the tight top border where my own body and the enemy's body concentrate.\n- If the enemy drifts right/up, avoid getting trapped near y=8 row; instead route back toward center/lower apples like (5,3) or (5,5).\n\nFinal move:\nDOWN",

This keeps several follow-up options (up to 6,5/6,6, left to 5,4/5,3, or down to 6,3).\n- DOWN to (7,3) also grabs an apple and leads toward the right-side cluster (7,2),(8,2),(9,3), but that route tends to push me nearer the right wall and my own top-right body segments, slightly increasing the chance of getting boxed later.\n- RIGHT (8,4) is the safest in terms of immediate freedom (no growth), but it forgoes an apple and cedes tempo in the tied score.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Take the apple at (6,4) now (LEFT).

None eats an apple this turn, so my tail (0,7) will move and free one cell.\n- Moving into my neck (RIGHT) is illegal, so excluded.\n\nTactical comparison:\n- UP (6,5) gives quick access to (6,6) and (5,5) on following turn, but one adjacent side (7,5) is occupied by my body, reducing some maneuverability.\n- DOWN (6,3) grants access to (5,3) and (7,3) apples, heading toward the lower cluster; decent options but fewer immediate branching choices.\n- LEFT (5,4) leads into the middle cluster with multiple nearby apples: (5,5), (4,4), and (5,3). From (5,4) I will have at least two strong follow-up apple moves and several escape routes toward the center/left side, which keeps options open and avoids pushing me toward the tight top-right area where much of my body already lies.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (5,4) now, then prioritize (5,5) or (4,4) / (5,3) depending on enemy movement. Keep routing through the center/left apples and avoid getting pulled back into my dense top/right body. Preserve space by not immediately committing to the right wall.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy head (4,1) cannot reach any of these three cells this turn, so no head-on risk this move.\n- All three safe moves will eat an apple, so my tail will not move this turn (I will grow), which reduces free space after the move \u2014 I should prefer the option that preserves the most future room.\n\nTactical comparison:\n- LEFT to (4,4) heads toward the left/central cluster including (4,2). Enemy head at (4,1) can get to (4,2) in one move, so that apple and that corridor are likely to be contested or blocked. Going left risks moving toward the enemy's local control.\n- UP to (5,5) is tempting (near (6,6)), but (5,6) and the 6,x corridor above are occupied by the enemy body, which could constrain my follow-ups after growing.\n- DOWN to (5,3) picks an apple and gives access to a fairly open lower/lateral area with several reachable apples (e.g. (5,0),(6,1),(7,2),(8,2),(2,0)). It preserves more immediate escape options (left/right/down) after growing and avoids moving toward the enemy cluster on the left.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Take (5,3) now (DOWN), then continue to sweep the lower/right apple cluster while keeping lateral escape options open. Avoid pushing into the dense left/top body areas; if enemy commits toward (4,2)/(4,3), use the lower region to collect uncontested apples and force the enemy into tighter spaces.\n\nDOWN",

Avoid moving left into the dense enemy/body cluster; keep to the lower/right corridor while monitoring whether the enemy tries to move up the board to contest (6,1).\n\nDOWN",

That is a direct head-on risk.\n- RIGHT -> (8,2): empty and contains an apple. The enemy cannot reach (8,2) this turn, so this is safe and gains an apple.\n\nRisk assessment and choice:\n- UP is illegal.\n- LEFT and DOWN both create immediate contested squares with the enemy head (either (6,2) or (7,1)). A head-on collision would kill us both; avoid unless we have a specific reason to force it.\n- RIGHT to (8,2) safely eats an apple and leaves multiple escape routes (up to (8,3) toward the (9,3) apple, or right/around the lower corridor). It increases my score and keeps options open while avoiding the enemy's immediate head moves.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (8,2) now, then go to (8,3) and likely (9,3) to collect that apple cluster.\n- Stay in the lower-right corridor to avoid the dense enemy body cluster on the left and reduce head-on risk.\n- Monitor enemy head moves; avoid stepping into any square the enemy can reach simultaneously.\n\nRIGHT",

Its best immediate moves are LEFT to (5,2) or UP to (6,3) (but (6,3) is part of my body and would be suicidal). They cannot reach (8,3), (9,2) or (8,1) this turn, so no immediate head-on risk for UP/RIGHT/DOWN.\n- LEFT is illegal and would kill me.\n- RIGHT is fine but slightly constrains my next move choices (RIGHT off-board from there). UP keeps two strong follow-up options (RIGHT to (9,3) apple or UP to (8,4) apple).\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (8,3) now, then take (9,3) or (8,4) next to keep gathering apples quickly.\n- Avoid moving into any square the enemy head can reach in the next turn; force the enemy into risky choices (they're close to my body and have some suicidal squares nearby).\n- Keep options open and prioritize apples that are reachable in 1\u20132 moves so I can reach 30 apples first while staying alive.\n\nUP",

From there my neck will be (8,0), so going back is illegal. My only other moves would be UP to (9,1) (occupied by my body) or RIGHT/DOWN off-board. Practically no safe follow-up \u2014 moving RIGHT now would leave me with no legal non-lethal move next turn. Too risky.\n\nEvaluate LEFT (7,0):\n- (7,0) is currently free. From (7,0) my only good follow-up is UP to (7,1), which contains an apple. That gives me +1 apple and extra length, and stays well away from the enemy head at (6,6). While this is somewhat forcing (LEFT then UP), it yields growth and keeps me in control of the local area rather than getting stuck on the right edge.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy head at (6,6) is far and cannot contest (7,1) in one turn. Many of their body segments occupy the central/bottom-left area (including (6,0) and (6,1)), so I should avoid being funneled into that tight corridor. The LEFT\u2192UP path gets an apple without running directly into the enemy body.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move LEFT to (7,0) and then UP to grab the apple at (7,1).\n- After eating, reassess: aim for bottom-row apples (1,0),(2,0),(4,0),(0,0) while avoiding the enemy\u2019s dense body around x=4..6. Keep moves that retain at least one escape out to open space (prefer moving toward x \u2264 6 only when it\u2019s safe).\n\nLEFT",
