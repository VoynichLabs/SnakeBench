That's Snake #1's body segment at (7,8) is close but (1,8) looks clear? Let me check again... (1,8) is clear! Safe!\n- DOWN to (1,6): Clear! No body there, opens up movement options\n- LEFT to (0,7): DEAD! That's off the board! Don't go there!\n- RIGHT to (2,7): DEAD! That's our OWN body segment! Don't hit yourself!\n\nWe got TWO safe moves: UP to (1,8) or DOWN to (1,6)!\n\nStrategic thinking time! Snake #1 is ABOVE US and to the RIGHT with their body blocking our upward path. We need to expand territory and catch up in this score battle!\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- UP to (1,8) moves us toward the top area and closer to the apple at (0,3) and (0,0)\n- DOWN to (1,6) keeps us in the center area but doesn't expand our territory much\n\nUP is looking better because:\n1.

From (7,\u202f9) we\u2019ll have LEFT (6,\u202f9) and RIGHT (8,\u202f9) open, plus DOWN back onto our own tail when it moves.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Stay aggressive** \u2013 grabbing the top\u2011right cluster (7,9\u202f\u2192\u202f8,9\u202f\u2192\u202f9,9) lets us later corner the rival\u2019s tiny tunnel on the left.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Decision**\n\nThe best combo of safety, growth, and future pressure is to **snag the apple at (7,\u202f9)**. That gives us +1 point, lengthens the snake, and leaves multiple exits for the next turn.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e short\u2011term plan**  \nAfter eating (7,\u202f9), swing RIGHT to (8,\u202f9) for the next apple, then RIGHT again to (9,\u202f9). With a long, solid tail anchored at the bottom\u2011right, we can later seal off the opponent\u2019s path by hugging the left wall and forcing him into a dead\u2011end.\n\n**Let\u2019s do it!**  \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE on turn 40 and this battle is STILL INSANE!\n\nLet me break down this CRAZY situation!\n\nCurrent situation:\n- We're at (0,2) with body [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)] and 9 apples\n- Snake #1 is at (8,9) with body [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)] and 18 apples (they're STILL DOMINATING!)\n- Board's looking WILD with apples scattered everywhere\n\nSafe moves check:\n- UP to (0,3): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n- DOWN to (0,1): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n- LEFT to (-1,2): DEAD! That's off the board!\n- RIGHT to (1,2): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n\nWAIT WHAT?! No safe moves? Let me double-check this board...\n\nOh snap! I see the issue! We're at (0,2) and our body is [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nSo (1,2) IS part of our body! That means RIGHT is DEAD!\n\nBut wait... let me look again at the board state:\n\n```\n 9 A . . A . . . T 1 A\n 8 . . . . T T T T . .\n 7 . . . . T . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T . . A . .\n 5 . A . . T T A . A .\n 4 T T . A . T T A . T\n 3 T T . . . . T . . T\n 2 0 T . . . . T T T T\n 1 . T T A . . A . A .\n 0 A T T A . . A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nLooking at row 2: \"0 T . . . . T T T T\"\n\nSo at (1,2) there's a T (body), but what about (2,2)? That's a T too!\n\nActually wait... let me trace our body again:\n- Head: (0,2)\n- Body: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nSo our body segments are: (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)\n\nThat means (2,2) is EMPTY! That's not part of our body!\n\nLet me check again:\n- UP to (0,3): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n- DOWN to (0,1): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n- LEFT to (-1,2): Off the board! DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (1,2): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n\nBut what about UP-RIGHT? No, we can only move one cell!\n\nWait... I think I see it! Our body shows (2,1) as our tail, but what about (2,2)? Let me look at the board again...\n\nActually, looking at the board state more carefully:\nRow 2: \"0 T . . . . T T T T\"\n- (0,2): Our head (0)\n- (1,2): T (our body)\n- (2,2): . (EMPTY!)\n- (3,2): . (EMPTY!)\n- etc.\n\nSo (2,2) is EMPTY! But we can't move diagonally...\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think...\n\nActually, I think I need to reconsider. Looking at our body list: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nThe tail is at (2,1), which means (2,2) should be EMPTY on the board!\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent cells. From (0,2), our options are:\n- UP: (0,3) - our body, DEAD\n- DOWN: (0,1) - our body, DEAD  \n- LEFT: (-1,2) - off board, DEAD\n- RIGHT: (1,2) - our body, DEAD\n\nThis can't be right... let me triple-check the body coordinates vs board!\n\nWait a minute... looking at the board again:\nRow 2: \"0 T . . . . T T T T\"\n\nPosition (0,2) is our head (0)\nPosition (1,2) is T (our body)\nPosition (2,2) is . (empty)\nPosition (3,2) is . (empty)\nPosition (4,2) is . (empty)\nPosition (5,2) is . (empty)\nPosition (6,2) is T (snake #1 body)\nPosition (7,2) is T (snake #1 body)\nPosition (8,2) is T (snake #1 body)\nPosition (9,2) is T (snake #1 body)\n\nSo (2,2) is definitely empty! But we can't reach it in one move from (0,2)...\n\nActually, wait! I think I need to reconsider the body list. Let me trace it carefully:\n\nHead at (0,2)\nBody: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nSo the body segments in order are:\n- (0,3)\n- (0,4)\n- (1,4)\n- (1,3)\n- (1,2) \n- (1,1)\n- (1,0)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,1) - tail\n\nThat means (2,2) is NOT part of our body! It's empty!\n\nBut from (0,2), we can only move to adjacent cells. (2,2) is two cells away diagonally...\n\nI'm confused. Let me re-read the problem...\n\nOh wait! I think I understand now! The issue is that our body list might be incorrect or the board might be showing something different!\n\nLet me just go with what the board shows:\n- We're at (0,2)\n- Our body appears to occupy (1,2) based on the board\n- (2,2) is empty\n\nBut we can't move to (2,2) directly...\n\nActually, let me reconsider the body list one more time. If our head is at (0,2) and the body is [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)], then:\n\nFrom (0,2), moving RIGHT would go to (1,2), which IS in our body list, so that's DEAD.\n\nBut what if there's a mistake? What if (1,2) shouldn't be in our body?\n\nNo, I need to trust the given information. The body list is [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)], so (1,2) is definitely part of our body.\n\nThis means RIGHT to (1,2) is DEAD.\n\nUP to (0,3) is DEAD (body)\nDOWN to (0,1) is DEAD (body)\nLEFT to (-1,2) is DEAD (off board)\n\nWait... this means we're TRAPPED! No safe moves!\n\nBut that can't be right for the game to continue...\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I'm misreading the body list?\n\nBody: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nIf our head is at (0,2), and we move RIGHT to (1,2), that would be into our own body, which is DEAD.\n\nBut what if the body list is wrong? What if (1,2) isn't actually part of our body?\n\nNo, I have to trust the given data. The body list explicitly includes (1,2).\n\nThis is a paradox! According to the body list, we should have no safe moves, but the game is still going!\n\nLet me reconsider... maybe I'm misunderstanding something about how the body works?\n\nActually, wait! I just realized something! The body list shows [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nBut if our head is at (0,2), and we look at the board, position (1,2) shows as \"T\" which represents body.\n\nSo RIGHT to (1,2) would indeed be into our own body, which is DEAD.\n\nUP to (0,3) is also into our body (first element of body list), DEAD.\nDOWN to (0,1) is into our body (sixth element of body list), DEAD.\nLEFT to (-1,2) is off the board, DEAD.\n\nThis means we're completely trapped with NO safe moves!\n\nBut that can't be... the game must have a safe move...\n\nUnless... unless I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system?\n\nLet me double-check: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n\nSo (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\nOur head is at (0,2), which would be column 0, row 2 from the bottom.\n\nLooking at the board representation, row 2 from the top is actually y=7 if we count from bottom...\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with the coordinate system!\n\nLet me reinterpret: if (0,0) is bottom-left, then:\n- Row 0 at the bottom: \"A T T A . . A . . .\"\n- Row 1 above that: \". T T A . . A . A .\"\n- Row 2 above that: \"0 T . . . . T T T T\"\n- etc.\n\nSo our head at (0,2) is in the third row from the bottom, first column.\n\nIn that row: \"0 T . . . . T T T T\"\n- (0,2): our head (0)\n- (1,2): T (body)\n- (2,2): . (empty)\n- (3,2): . (empty)\n- (4,2): . (empty)\n- (5,2): . (empty)\n- (6,2): T (snake #1 body)\n- (7,2): T (snake #1 body)\n- (8,2): T (snake #1 body)\n- (9,2): T (snake #1 body)\n\nSo from (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2) would be into our own body (T), which is DEAD.\n\nBut what about the body list? It shows [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\nIf (1,2) is in our body list, and the board shows T at (1,2), then RIGHT is indeed DEAD.\n\nUP from (0,2) would go to (0,3), which is the first element in our body list, so that's also DEAD.\nDOWN from (0,2) would go to (0,1), which is the sixth element in our body list (1,1)? No, wait...\n\nLet me recount the body list from the head:\n- Head: (0,2)\n- Body[0]: (0,3) - above head\n- Body[1]: (0,4) - two above head\n- Body[2]: (1,4) - right and two above\n- Body[3]: (1,3) - right and above\n- Body[4]: (1,2) - right (same row as head)\n- Body[5]: (1,1) - right and below\n- Body[6]: (1,0) - right and two below\n- Body[7]: (2,0) - two right and two below\n- Body[8]: (2,1) - two right and below (tail)\n\nSo DOWN from (0,2) would go to (0,1), which is NOT in our body list! That should be safe!\n\nLet me check the board at (0,1): Row 1 from bottom is \". T T A . . A . A .\"\nPosition (0,1) is \".\", which is empty!\n\nSo DOWN to (0,1) should be SAFE!\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (0,1) was in our body... let me recount...\n\nBody list: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\n\n(0,1) is NOT in this list! So DOWN to (0,1) should be safe!\n\nAnd the board confirms (0,1) is empty!\n\nSo our safe moves are:\n- DOWN to (0,1): Safe! Empty cell!\n\nThat's it? Only one safe move?\n\nLet me double-check UP: (0,3) - that's Body[0], so DEAD.\nLEFT: (-1,2) - off board, DEAD.\nRIGHT: (1,2) - that's Body[4], so DEAD.\n\nSo indeed, only DOWN to (0,1) is safe!\n\nDOWN\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We're LIVE on turn 41 and this battle is STILL INSANE!\n\nLet me break down this CRAZY situation!\n\nCurrent situation:\n- We're at (0,1) with body [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)] and 9 apples\n- Snake #1 is at (9,9) with body [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)] and 19 apples (they're STILL DOMINATING!)\n- Board's looking WILD with apples scattered everywhere\n\nSafe moves check:\n- UP to (0,2): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n- DOWN to (0,0): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n- LEFT to (-1,1): DEAD! That's off the board!\n- RIGHT to (1,1): DEAD! That's our body segment!\n\nWAIT WHAT?! No safe moves? Let me double-check this board...\n\nOh snap! I see the issue! We're at (0,1) and our body is [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]\n\nSo (1,1) IS part of our body! That means RIGHT is DEAD!\n\nBut wait... let me look again at the board state:\n\n```\n 9 A . . A . . . T 1 A\n 8 . . . . T T T T . .\n 7 . A . . T . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T . . A . .\n 5 . A . . T T A . A .\n 4 T T . A . T T A . T\n 3 T T . . . . T . . T\n 2 T T T . . . T T T T\n 1 0 T T A . . A . A .\n 0 A T T A . . A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nLooking at row 1: \"0 T T A . . A . A .\"\n\nSo at (1,1) there's a T (body), but what about (1,2)? That's also T!\n\nActually wait... let me trace our body again:\n- Head: (0,1)\n- Body: [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]\n\nSo our body segments are: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)\n\nThat means (1,1) is definitely part of our body!\n\nLet me check again:\n- UP to (0,2): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n- DOWN to (0,0): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n- LEFT to (-1,1): Off the board! DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (1,1): That's our body segment! DEAD!\n\nThis can't be right... let me triple-check the body coordinates vs board!\n\nWait a minute... looking at the board again:\nRow 1: \"0 T T A . . A . A .\"\n\nPosition (0,1) is our head (0)\nPosition (1,1) is T (our body)\nPosition (2,1) is T (our body)\nPosition (3,1) is A (apple)\nPosition (4,1) is . (empty)\nPosition (5,1) is . (empty)\nPosition (6,1) is . (empty)\nPosition (7,1) is A (apple)\nPosition (8,1) is . (empty)\nPosition (9,1) is A (apple)\n\nSo (1,1) is definitely T (our body) on the board!\n\nBut we can only move to adjacent cells. From (0,1), our options are:\n- UP: (0,2) - our body, DEAD\n- DOWN: (0,0) - our body, DEAD\n- LEFT: (-1,1) - off board, DEAD\n- RIGHT: (1,1) - our body, DEAD\n\nThis means we're TRAPPED! No safe moves!\n\nBut that can't be... the game must have a safe move...\n\nUnless... unless I'm misunderstanding something about how the body works?\n\nActually, wait! I just realized something! The body list shows [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]\n\nBut if our head is at (0,1), and we look at the board, position (1,1) shows as \"T\" which represents body.\n\nSo RIGHT to (1,1) would indeed be into our own body, which is DEAD.\n\nUP from (0,1) would go to (0,2), which is the first element in our body list, so that's also DEAD.\nDOWN from (0,1) would go to (0,0), which is the eighth element in our body list, so that's also DEAD.\nLEFT to (-1,1) is off the board, DEAD.\n\nThis means we're completely trapped with NO safe moves!\n\nBut that can't be... the game must have a safe move...\n\nUnless... unless I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system?\n\nLet me double-check: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n\nSo (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\nOur head is at (0,1), which would be column 0, row 1 from the bottom.\n\nLooking at the board representation, row 1 from the bottom is \". T T A . . A . A .\"\n- (0,1): our head (0)\n- (1,1): T (our body)\n- (2,1): T (our body)\n- etc.\n\nSo from (0,1), RIGHT to (1,1) would be into our own body (T), which is DEAD.\n\nBut what about the body list? It shows [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]\n\nIf (1,1) is in our body list, and the board shows T at (1,1), then RIGHT is indeed DEAD.\n\nUP from (0,1) would go to (0,2), which is Body[0], so DEAD.\nDOWN from (0,1) would go to (0,0), which is Body[7], so DEAD.\nLEFT to (-1,1) is off the board, DEAD.\n\nThis means we're completely trapped with NO safe moves!\n\nBut that can't be... the game must have a safe move...\n\nWait! I think I see it! Looking at the board again at row 1: \"0 T T A . . A . A .\"\n\nPosition (0,1) is our head (0)\nPosition (1,1) is T (our body)\nPosition (2,1) is T (our body)\n\nBut what about position (0,0)? That's \"A\" on the board!\n\nLet me check the body list again... Body[7] is (1,0) and Body[8] is (2,0). Neither is (0,0)!\n\nSo DOWN to (0,0) should be safe! It's an apple!\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (0,0) was in our body... let me recount...\n\nBody list: [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)]\n\n(0,0) is NOT in this list! So DOWN to (0,0) should be safe!\n\nAnd the board confirms (0,0) is an apple!\n\nSo our safe moves are:\n- DOWN to (0,0): Safe! Apple cell!\n\nThat's it? Only one safe move?\n\nLet me double-check UP: (0,2) - that's Body[0], so DEAD.\nLEFT: (-1,1) - off board, DEAD.\nRIGHT: (1,1) - that's Body[6], so DEAD.\n\nSo indeed, only DOWN to (0,0) is safe!\n\nDOWN",
