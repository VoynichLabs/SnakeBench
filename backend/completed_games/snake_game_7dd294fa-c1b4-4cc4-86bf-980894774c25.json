Possible moves:\n    - DOWN to (6,8): Adjacent to my body at (4,8) and (4,7). If they move here, they risk collision with me if I move RIGHT or DOWN.\n    - LEFT to (5,9): Adjacent to their body at (5,9). Safe but moves them closer to my body at (4,8) and (4,7).\n    - RIGHT to (7,9): Safe but moves them away from me.\n    - UP is off-board.\n    - Most likely, they will move DOWN to (6,8) to threaten my body or to eat an apple if one appears nearby.\n\n**Apples:**\n- Remaining: (9, 0), (8, 0), (1, 2), (7, 9), (5, 0).\n- Closest apple: **(1, 2)** (distance 7 from (2,7)).\n  - Path to (1,2):\n    - LEFT to (1,7), then DOWN to (1,6), then DOWN to (1,5), then DOWN to (1,4), then DOWN to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 6 moves total.\n    - Alternatively, RIGHT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5), then DOWN to (1,4), then DOWN to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 8 moves total (worse).\n    - The apple at (7,9) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (distance 5), but the enemy is already near the top-right corner, making it risky.\n    - The apples at (9,0) and (8,0) are far away (distance 17 and 16, respectively).\n\n**Possible Moves from (2,7):**\n1. **DOWN (to (2,6))**: Safe, moves me toward the bottom of the board. Avoids immediate collision with the enemy if they move DOWN to (6,8). Keeps options open for future moves.\n2. **LEFT (to (1,7))**: Safe, moves me toward the left edge. Could be useful for reaching the apple at (1,2) in the future.\n3. **RIGHT (to (3,7))**: Safe, but moves me closer to the enemy\u2019s body at (4,8) and (4,7). If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,8), they will still not collide with me, but this move risks future collisions if the enemy moves aggressively.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\n- If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,8), they will be closer to my body but not collide with me immediately. This move is safe for me but may limit future options if the enemy continues to press downward.\n- If the enemy moves LEFT to (5,9), they will move closer to my body at (4,8) and (4,7), but still no immediate collision.\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,9), they will move away from me, giving me more breathing room.\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- **LEFT to (1,7)** is the best choice because:\n  - It is safe and avoids immediate collision with the enemy.\n  - It moves me toward the apple at (1,2), which is the closest reachable apple.\n  - It keeps my body compact and avoids getting trapped near the enemy's head.\n  - It allows me to reassess the board state on the next turn and adjust my strategy based on the enemy's move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Turn 17**: Move LEFT to (1,7) to get closer to the apple at (1,2).\n2. **Turn 18**: Assess the board state again. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,8), consider moving DOWN to (1,6) or RIGHT to (2,7) to avoid future collisions. If the enemy moves away, continue moving toward (1,2).\n3. **Future Moves**: Prioritize reaching the apple at (1,2) while avoiding the enemy's head. If the enemy continues to threaten, consider targeting the apple at (7,9) or moving to safer areas.\n\nLEFT",

Safe and moves them away from me.\n\n**Optimal Move:**\n- **DOWN to (1,5)** is the best choice because:\n  - It is safe and moves me directly toward the apple at (1,2), which is the closest reachable apple.\n  - It keeps my body compact and avoids getting trapped near the enemy's head.\n  - It allows me to reach the apple in the next few turns without immediate risk of collision with the enemy.\n  - If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), they will still not collide with me immediately, but I will need to reassess future moves carefully.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Turn 19**: Move DOWN to (1,5) to continue toward the apple at (1,2).\n2. **Turn 20**: Assess the board state again. If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), consider moving RIGHT to (2,5) or UP to (1,6) to avoid future collisions. If the enemy moves away, continue moving DOWN to reach (1,2).\n3. **Future Moves**: Prioritize reaching the apple at (1,2) while avoiding the enemy's head. If the enemy continues to threaten, consider moving to safer areas or targeting other apples if (1,2) becomes unreachable.\n\nDOWN",

The apple at (9,2) is reachable but far away. Instead, I should prioritize maintaining flexibility and avoiding getting trapped in a corner.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (2,1), I can then move UP to (2,2) next turn, which is safe and keeps options open.\n- This move doesn\u2019t directly help me reach apples but avoids immediate threats and keeps my body compact.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Turn 24**: Move **RIGHT to (2,1)** to maintain safety and flexibility.\n2. **Turn 25**: Reassess the board for the next closest apple or safe path to avoid the enemy.\n3. **Future Moves**: Prioritize reaching apples while avoiding the enemy's path.
