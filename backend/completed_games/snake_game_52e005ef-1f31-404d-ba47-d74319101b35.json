To minimize this risk, I should try to keep my body as flexible as possible. I can do this by initially choosing a direction that will position me to respond to any new developments.\n\nSo, if I think about where I can go next without getting cut off and maintaining flexibility, that means not heading left, right now. \n\nHmmm, I have a few paths in mind, but since any movement would involve extending my length without adding an apple on the current move, I would not gains an advantage over making a strategic movement. \n\nSo to create a safe option that will sustain any potential deviations made by the enemy, my best bet is...

The body is none, so the snake is just the head. The enemy snake is at (1,5), which is in a different area. \n\nFirst, I need to check if moving in any direction would cause a collision. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's see:\n\n- UP would take the head to (4,2). Looking at the board, in row 2 (y=2), there's a snake #1 at (1,5), but that's not in the same row. The apples are at y=8 and y=9. So (4,2) is empty. So UP is safe.\n\n- DOWN would take it to (4,0). The bottom row (y=0) is empty except for the snake's own movement. Since the snake is at (4,1), moving down to (4,0) would be out of bounds? Wait, the coordinates go from 0 to 9 in both x and y. So (4,0) is valid. But the board at y=0 is all dots except the snake's position. So moving down is possible.\n\n- LEFT would take it to (3,1). The x=3, y=1 is empty. So that's safe.\n\n- RIGHT would take it to (5,1). But that's where the head was before the last move. Since the body is none, moving right would put the head back to (5,1), which would be overlapping with its previous position. But since the body is none, does that count as a collision? The rules say that running into yourself (like going backwards) causes death. So moving right would be moving back to the previous position. But since the body is none, the snake's body is just the head. So moving right would make the head go to (5,1), which is where it was before. But since there's no body, maybe it's allowed? Wait, the rule says \"if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die.\" So if the snake moves back to a previous position, even if it's just the head, that's a collision.

One of them is right above me at (7, 2), but it's also a bit of a stretch to get to it without risking running into the wall or the enemy snake.\n\nBefore I make my next move, I want to remind myself of my current strategy: prioritize playing it safe and keeping my options open. I don't want to take unnecessary risks that could put me in a tight spot.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm not feeling too pressured to go for the apple above me just yet.
