Considering the board and the current snake's position:\n\n1. The board is in 10x10 coordinates, with (0,0) at the bottom-left.\n2. The snake is at (3, 2) - this is in row 3 and column 2.\n3. The possible moves are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n4. Given the last move seems to have been D (DOWN), the snake is likely moving downwards.\n\nLet's think out loud:\n\n- UP would move me to (2, 2) - adjacent\n- DOWN is where I am now, (3, 2)\n- LEFT would be (2, 2) - adjacent\n- RIGHT would be (4, 2) - not valid as it's outside the 10x10 board\n\nGiven that the last move was D (DOWN), the logical next move would be to continue in that direction.\n\nSo, my decided next move is: DOWN",

My goal is to reach the nearest apple efficiently without collision.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3,2), far away, so no immediate threat. The strongest option is apple at (6,7) or (6,8), (9,3), (9,4). To minimize distance, (9,4) is closer (diagonal) than (6,8). But 9,4 requires moving right 8, up 3 \u2192 risks route through center.  \nApple at (6,8) is 5 right, 7 up \u2014 longer.  \nApple at (9,3) is 8 right, 2 down \u2014 but down into lower Y? From (1,1) to (9,3): move NE? No direct. Path would cross near center, but no apples there yet.\n\nBest move: Go RIGHT to (2,1), then aim up toward (6,7) or (6,8).  \nOption 1: RIGHT \u2192 (2,1), then evaluate next.  \nThis brings the head closer to (6,7) or (6,8) without overlapping body or obstacle.\n\nStrategy: Proceed right to (2,1) to extend territory, then assess upward path to nearest apple without crossing through enemy path.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**",
