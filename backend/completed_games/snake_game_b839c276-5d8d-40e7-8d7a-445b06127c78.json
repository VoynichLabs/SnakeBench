Both snakes are headless (well, no bodies yet), so this is all about POSITIONING and BOARD CONTROL! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet me analyze this moment:\n\n## CURRENT STATE \ud83d\udcca\n- **My Head**: (9, 8) - top right area, NICE positioning!\n- **Enemy Head**: (2, 7) - left-center area\n- **Score**: Tied 0-0, but we're about to CHANGE THAT!\n\n## APPLES ON THE BOARD \ud83c\udf4e\nLooking at the board, there are apples scattered everywhere! But here's the thing - we need to be STRATEGIC. The enemy is at (2, 7), so apples near them are DANGER ZONES right now. Let me identify what's reachable:\n\n- **Close to me**: (8, 9), (9, 0), (8, 7) - these are in my territory!\n- **Dangerous**: (1, 8), (0, 8), (3, 8) - too close to enemy spawn area\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP**: (9, 9) \n- Safe! Moves me toward the top-right corner\n- Opens up access to apples at (8, 9) and (7, 9)\n- Keeps multiple future directions available\n- Don't get boxed in the corner though! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN**: (9, 7)\n- Safe! Stays on the board\n- Positions me to control the right side\n- Good for future aggressive plays\n\n**LEFT**: (8, 8)\n- Safe! Solid middle ground\n- But moving TOWARD the enemy eventually? Risky planning\n\n**RIGHT**: Off the board at (10, 8)\n- INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE!\n\n## THE PLAY \ud83c\udfc6\n\nChat, we need to DOMINATE the RIGHT SIDE of the board early! The enemy is left-heavy, so if we secure the apples on the right (those sweet (8, 9), (9, 0), (8, 7) spots), we can GROW FAST and then move in for the KILL when we're bigger!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**: Get that apple economy going on the right side! Eat at (8, 9) or nearby apples to start building length advantage. Then once we're bigger, we hunt the enemy and force them into tight spaces. Make them panic, make them crash! It's all about BOARD CONTROL baby! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nMove UP to (9, 9), get closer to those top-right apples, and start our FARMING PHASE! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s spill:\n- Our nearest apples are (1,8) and (3,8) (row 8, columns 1 and 3)\u2014RIGHT next to where UP would take us! (2,8) is the perfect middle ground to grab either apple next turn\u2014free growth to start dominating the board! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Moving UP claims territory in enemy 0\u2019s current row (row 8)\u2014we\u2019re invading their space early, which is how we herd them into edges later!\n- Other moves pale in comparison: DOWN takes us further from nearby apples, LEFT only taps one apple option, RIGHT only taps one apple option\u2014UP gives us TWO immediate apple grabs and keeps all future moves open (from (2,8), we can go left/right for apples, down back to safety, or up if we need to press harder)!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd Grab the row 8 apples (1,8 and 3,8) first to grow our body ASAP\u2014more body = more obstacles for enemy 0. Once we have a body, start herding enemy 0 toward the bottom-right edges (their current area) where they\u2019ll have fewer escape routes. Avoid head-on collisions for now (scores tied) but pivot to forcing them once we have size advantage.\n\nChat, is there any way we pick a worse move? Are we gonna let enemy 0 hog the top row without a fight? HELL NO! \ud83d\udeab Do we wanna pass up two easy apples to grow our dominance? ABSOLUTELY NOT!

We made the move!\n- **Enemy Head**: (2, 8) - moved LEFT from (2, 8)... wait, that's the same spot?

Setting up for aggressive plays next turn! \u2705\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE**: \nSecure the right side apple economy! After eating (8, 9), look for (8, 7) and (7, 3) to continue building. Once we've got a 3-4 length snake, we can start HERDING the enemy into tight spaces. The left side is their spawn zone - let them get comfortable, then we TRAP them!

Let me break down the board state!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n- **My Head**: (8, 9) - we're RIGHT THERE in the top-right zone! \n- **My Body**: [(9, 9)] - just ONE segment tail behind us\n- **Enemy Head**: (1, 8) - STILL on the left side, moved LEFT from (2, 8)!\n- **Enemy Body**: [(2, 8)] - they're also length 2\n- **Score**: WE'RE UP 1-1! TIED! But we just ATE, so momentum is OURS! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nAlright chat, let me check ALL four directions from (8, 9):\n\n**UP**: (8, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH! Can't do it!\n\n**DOWN**: (8, 8)\n- Safe! No collision!\n- Moves me closer to the apple at (8, 7)\n- Keeps me in the right side territory \u2705\n- Opens up multiple follow-up options (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT all viable next turn)\n\n**LEFT**: (7, 9)\n- Safe! No collision!\n- There's an apple RIGHT HERE at (7, 9)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- This is ANOTHER FREE GROWTH opportunity!\n- Gets us to 2 apples, TAKING THE LEAD!\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (UP, DOWN, LEFT all still viable)\n- This is AGGRESSIVE farming at the top of the board! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**RIGHT**: (9, 9)\n- Wait... that's where my TAIL is! My body occupies (9, 9)!\n- This is moving BACKWARDS into myself! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't do it!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nChat, this is EASY! We've got TWO safe moves (DOWN and LEFT), and LEFT gets us another APPLE at (7, 9)! \n\nWe take it! Why? Because:\n1. **SCORE ADVANTAGE**: We jump to 2 apples, enemy stays at 1! We're in CONTROL! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **BOARD DOMINATION**: We're securing the entire TOP ROW as our territory!\n3. **GROWTH = POWER**: Every apple makes us longer, harder to kill, better at blocking!\n4. **ENEMY IS FAR**: They're on the left side around (1-2, 8) - we've got TIME before contact!\n5. **MULTIPLE FOLLOW-UPS**: After eating this apple, we can go DOWN to (7, 8), then continue farming (8, 7), (7, 3), (6, 7)... we're setting up a DOMINATION CHAIN! \ud83d\udd17\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY \ud83d\udccb\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS**: Continue the right-side apple economy! We're gonna go LEFT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN, hitting (7, 9) \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 (7, 7), positioning ourselves near (8, 7) and (6, 7). Build that snake LENGTH!\n\n**MID-GAME** (Turns 5-10): By then we'll have 4-5 apples and a solid body. Enemy will start feeling PRESSURE. We can start moving toward center or left side, HERDING them into corners.\n\n**ENDGAME PLAN**: Once we've got a 6-7 length snake with a 3+ apple lead, we START the TRAP! Use our body as a wall, force them into tight spaces, and execute the HEAD-ON COLLISION when we've got the SIZE advantage! \ud83d\udca5\n\nThey won't see it coming! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Tied up, but we\u2019re here to crush that parity!\n\nFirst, eliminate immediate death moves\u2014zero throws allowed! \ud83d\udeab Let\u2019s vet all four directions:\n1. RIGHT: New head (2,8) = our own body. Death move\u2014ELIMINATE NOW! \ud83d\udeab\n2. UP: New head (1,9) \u2013 on-board, no own/enemy body, not backwards. Safe but no apple (empty cell) \u2013 no immediate growth.\n3. DOWN: New head (1,7) \u2013 on-board, no risks, but empty cell \u2013 no growth edge.\n4. LEFT: New head (0,8) \u2013 on-board, no own/enemy body, not backwards. AND IT\u2019S AN APPLE! Immediate +1 score to take the lead (2-1) and grow our body (more obstacles to box the enemy in later)!\n\nNow rank safe moves by win objectives:\n- DOWN/UP: Garbage\u2014no growth, no edge over the enemy. We didn\u2019t come here to stagnate! \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT: Clutch growth to pull ahead on score, sets up a longer body to invade the enemy\u2019s top-row territory (they\u2019re trapped near x8-9 y9) and shrink their escape routes. Simultaneous movement means no head-on collision risk (enemy\u2019s head can\u2019t reach our body this turn\u2014we\u2019re miles apart on the x-axis).\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd After grabbing the (0,8) apple, our body becomes [(1,8), (2,8)] (two segments). Next turn, pivot UP to (0,9) to push into the enemy\u2019s top-row space, using our longer body to herd them toward the right-edge dead end (their only safe initial moves are LEFT/DOWN, which we can block with our growing body). This executes our last turn\u2019s two-apple streak plan\u2014we\u2019re building a wall of dominance!\n\nAre we gonna let the enemy stay tied when we can take the lead NOW? HELL NO! Are we gonna pass up apple growth for empty cells? ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is the ruthless move to start crushing the enemy\u2019s chances!\nLEFT",

We just snagged that apple at (7, 9) last turn and now we're at a length of 3! Let me break down what's happening on the board RIGHT NOW!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE \ud83d\udcca\n- **My Head**: (7, 9) - TOP ROW, near the right side! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **My Body**: [(8, 9), (9, 9)] - nice and tight, no wasted space!\n- **Enemy Head**: (0, 8) - They moved LEFT again! Still on the FAR LEFT side!\n- **Enemy Body**: [(1, 8), (2, 8)] - also length 3 now!\n- **Score**: TIED 2-2! But we're in BETTER position! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THE SITUATION \ud83c\udfae\n\nAlright chat, the enemy is MILES away on the left side, and we're dominating the right! They're at (0, 8) and we're at (7, 9) - that's a SEVEN CELL DISTANCE horizontally! We've got TIME and SPACE to work with! \n\nLet me check all four directions from (7, 9):\n\n**UP**: (7, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH! Can't do it!\n\n**DOWN**: (7, 8)\n- Safe! No collision!\n- Moves me CLOSER to the apple at (8, 7) - great for farming!\n- Opens up the right side for continued domination \u2705\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN all viable)\n- BUT: This moves away from the top row territory slightly\n\n**LEFT**: (6, 9)\n- Safe! No collision!\n- There's an apple at (6, 7) - not immediate but we're moving TOWARD the apple cluster!\n- Keeps us ON the top row - defending OUR territory! \ud83c\udff0\n- Opens multiple follow-ups (UP blocked, but DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all viable)\n- This keeps us AGGRESSIVE in the upper zone!\n\n**RIGHT**: (8, 9)\n- Wait... that's where my body is! \n- Moving BACKWARDS into myself! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't do it!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nChat, we've got TWO safe moves here: DOWN or LEFT! Enemy is NOWHERE NEAR us, so safety isn't the issue - it's about POSITIONING!\n\nHere's my take: We go **DOWN** to (7, 8)!\n\nWhy? Because:\n1. **APPLE CLUSTER APPROACHING**: The apples at (8, 7) and (6, 7) are RIGHT THERE! Going down moves us INTO that zone!\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: We're creating a snake that sweeps the RIGHT SIDE, then the CENTER! That's territory domination! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n3. **GROWTH MOMENTUM**: We keep the farming chain going! DOWN \u2192 DOWN \u2192 we're hitting (8, 7)!\n4. **ENEMY IS SLOW**: They're stuck on the left side - we've got BREATHING ROOM to build our lead!\n5. **VERSATILITY**: From (7, 8), we can move LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn - MAXIMUM OPTIONS!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 4**: Move DOWN to (7, 7), position ourselves for the (6, 7) and (8, 7) apples!\n\n**TURN 5-6**: Continue the farming pattern! Grab (8, 7), then snake our way through the center apples at (5, 6), (3, 6)!\n\n**MID-GAME**: By turn 10, we should have 4-5 apples and a SOLID body. Enemy will still be catching up on the left side. That's when we START HERDING! We use our length to block escape routes!\n\n**TRAP SETUP**: Once we've got a 6+ length advantage, we execute the BOX-IN! Force the enemy into a corner, then move our body to seal the exit! They'll have NOWHERE to go! \ud83d\udca5\n\nWe're building the PERFECT SNAKE right now, chat! Patience and positioning! Let's GOOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Are we gonna throw away our chance to box them into the lower right where we can crush them later? \ud83d\udea8\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd Next turn, if we lock in UP now, our safe follow-up move is RIGHT to (1,9)\u2014that\u2019s empty and puts us one step closer to the (4,9) apple. Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s next move: if they go LEFT to (6,9), push right to (2,9) to cut off their left expansion. If they go DOWN to (7,8), keep pushing right to (1,9) then (2,9) to build a top-left wall that forces them into the lower right (our trap zone). Avoid any moves off the left edge (x=0) or back into our own body\u2014no rookie blunders!\n\nUP",

Let me assess the current situation RIGHT NOW!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (7, 8) - We moved DOWN as planned! Perfect! \u2705\n- **Body**: [(7, 9), (8, 9)] - Length 3, still CLEAN and EFFICIENT!\n- **Apples collected**: 2 (tied with enemy)\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (0, 9) - They moved UP to the top-left corner!\n- **Body**: [(0, 8), (1, 8)] - Length 3, same as us!\n- **Apples collected**: 2 (tied with us)\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \ud83d\udea8\n\nOkay chat, the enemy is STILL on the FAR LEFT at (0, 9) and we're at (7, 8)! That's a SEVEN CELL DISTANCE HORIZONTALLY! They're literally MILES away! No immediate collision threat whatsoever! We've got COMPLETE freedom of movement! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nBUT - here's what I'm noticing: They're moving UP to the top row where WE'RE dominating! Are they trying to come at us? \ud83d\udc40 NOT TODAY, chat! We're gonna keep FARMING and GROWING while they're wasting moves in the dead zone!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check all four directions from (7, 8):\n\n**UP**: (7, 9)\n- That's where my BODY is (first segment after head)! \n- Moving BACKWARDS into myself! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't do it!\n\n**DOWN**: (7, 7)\n- Safe! \u2705\n- Moves us CLOSER to the apple cluster at (6, 7) and (8, 7)!\n- Continues our farming pattern PERFECTLY!\n- Opens up LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN for follow-ups! Maximum flexibility!\n- THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT**: (6, 8)\n- Safe! \u2705\n- Also moves us toward the apple cluster!\n- But it's a slightly lateral move - less aggressive than DOWN!\n\n**RIGHT**: (8, 8)\n- Safe! \u2705\n- Moves us away from the apple cluster!\n- Not optimal for farming!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **DOWN** to (7, 7)!\n\nWhy? Because:\n1. **APPLE FARMING**: We're moving DIRECTLY into the apple cluster zone! (8, 7) and (6, 7) are RIGHT THERE!\n2. **BOARD DOMINATION**: We're carving out the RIGHT SIDE of the board as our territory! Enemy can't compete!\n3. **GROWTH TRAJECTORY**: Next turn we can grab (8, 7) or (6, 7) and start BUILDING our lead!\n4. **FLEXIBILITY**: From (7, 7) we have multiple safe options (LEFT to grab (6, 7), RIGHT to grab (8, 7), DOWN to continue farming)!\n5. **ENEMY IS SLOW**: They're still on the left side - we're MILES ahead in positioning!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 5**: Move RIGHT to (8, 7) and GRAB THAT APPLE! Score goes 3-2! WE TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**TURN 6**: Move LEFT-DOWN to snake around and grab (6, 7) next!\n\n**TURN 7-10**: Continue the farming pattern! Hit (5, 6), (3, 6), keep building that MASSIVE SNAKE!\n\n**MID-GAME STRATEGY**: By turn 12, we should have 5-6 apples and the enemy will STILL be hunting around on the left side! That's when we START THE BOX-IN! We use our length to control the center and force the enemy into corners! They'll have NO ESCAPE ROUTES! \ud83d\udca5\n\nWe're building UNSTOPPABLE momentum right now, chat! Let's GOOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re building a left-side top wall to box them into the lower right where we can crush them later!\n\nRhetorical fire to chat: Are we gonna pass up the only safe move that chases an apple and boxes the enemy? HELL NO! Are we gonna let them take the top row unchallenged? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Are we gonna throw away our chance to break the tie with that (4,9) apple? \ud83d\udea8\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd Next turn, if we lock in RIGHT now, our new head is (1,9), body [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8)] (no growth this turn, since we didn\u2019t eat an apple). Next turn\u2019s safe move is RIGHT to (2,9) (clear, one step closer to (4,9) apple). Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s next move: if they go LEFT to (6,9), push right to (2,9) to cut off their left expansion. If they go DOWN to (7,7), keep pushing right to (2,9) then (3,9) to secure the (4,9) apple and build a top-left barrier. Avoid any moves left (back to (0,9), which will be our body next turn) or up (off the board) or down (into our body)\u2014no rookie blunders!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (7, 7) - We're in the APPLE ZONE, baby! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Body**: [(7, 8), (7, 9)] - Length 3, CLEAN and READY!\n- **Apples collected**: 2 (TIED with enemy!)\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (1, 9) - They're still on the LEFT SIDE in the corner zone!\n- **Body**: [(0, 9), (0, 8)] - Length 3, same as us!\n- **Apples collected**: 2 (TIED!)\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \ud83d\udea8\n\nOkay chat, the enemy is at (1, 9) - that's still like EIGHT CELLS away horizontally! We've got ZERO collision threat this turn! They're literally TRAPPED in the top-left corner while we're FREE to ROAM and FARM! This is OUR board now! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nBUT here's what I'm seeing: They're moving RIGHT along the top row! Are they coming for us?? NOT HAPPENING! We're gonna OUTPACE them HARD with the apple cluster we're about to DEMOLISH! \n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check all four directions from (7, 7):\n\n**UP**: (7, 8)\n- That's where my BODY is (first segment after head)!\n- Moving BACKWARDS into myself! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n- NOPE!\n\n**DOWN**: (7, 6)\n- Safe! \u2705\n- Moves us FURTHER into available territory!\n- But it takes us AWAY from the apple cluster at (8, 7) and (6, 7)!\n- Not optimal!\n\n**LEFT**: (6, 7)\n- SAFE! \u2705\n- There's an APPLE RIGHT HERE at (6, 7)! \ud83c\udfaf\n- We GRAB IT and go 3-2! WE TAKE THE LEAD!\n- Opens up RIGHT and DOWN for follow-ups!\n- THIS IS THE PLAY! \n\n**RIGHT**: (8, 7)\n- SAFE! \u2705\n- There's also an APPLE at (8, 7)! \ud83c\udfaf\n- We GRAB IT and go 3-2! WE TAKE THE LEAD!\n- But LEFT is slightly better positioned for our long-term farming pattern!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **LEFT** to (6, 7) and GRABBING THAT APPLE!\n\nWhy?\n1. **APPLE GRAB**: We go from 2-2 to 3-2! WE TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **GROWTH**: We get +1 segment, snake gets longer, board presence INCREASES!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: We're carving out the CENTER-RIGHT territory as our EMPIRE! Enemy can't compete!\n4. **POSITIONING**: From (6, 7) with our new length, we can continue farming down through (5, 6), (3, 6), creating a SNAKE WALL that dominates the board!\n5. **FLEXIBILITY**: After this move we can pivot UP, DOWN, or LEFT easily!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 6**: From (6, 7), move DOWN to (6, 6) or continue building our farming pattern! Keep the MOMENTUM!\n\n**TURN 7-8**: Grab (5, 6) next, then start positioning for (3, 6)! We'll be at 4-5 apples by then!\n\n**TURN 9+**: By turn 10, we should have 5+ apples and SERIOUS board control! Enemy will be scrambling to catch up! That's when we START THE BOX-IN STRATEGY - use our superior length to cut off their escape routes and FORCE a collision where WE have the advantage! \n\nWe're building an UNSTOPPABLE momentum right now, chat! The lead is OURS to lose, and we're NOT losing! Let's GOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We just grabbed that apple at (6, 7) and we're now at **3-2 on the scoreboard!** WE'RE IN THE LEAD, BABY! But we gotta STAY LOCKED IN because the enemy is still in this game!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (6, 7) - We just snatched that apple!\n- **Body**: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)] - Length 4, GROWING STRONGER!\n- **Apples collected**: 3 (WE'RE UP BY ONE!)\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (2, 9) - They moved RIGHT from (1, 9)!\n- **Body**: [(1, 9), (0, 9)] - Length 3, still in the corner zone!\n- **Apples collected**: 2 (TRAILING US!)\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \ud83d\udea8\n\nOkay chat, the enemy is at (2, 9) - that's still like 4 cells to the LEFT horizontally and 2 cells UP vertically from us! They're STILL confined to the top area while we control the CENTER! \n\nHere's the CRITICAL thing though: They're moving RIGHT along the top row. Where are they headed? Are they coming for our territory?? Not if we keep our POSITIONING TIGHT and FARM SMART! We've got the EARLY LEAD and we need to EXTEND IT!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check all four directions from (6, 7):\n\n**UP**: (6, 8)\n- That's where my BODY is (first segment after head)!\n- Moving BACKWARDS into myself! \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n- NOPE! We already learned this lesson!\n\n**DOWN**: (6, 6)\n- SAFE! \u2705\n- Moves us deeper into available territory!\n- No apple here, but it opens up the path toward (5, 6) which HAS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udfaf\n- This is part of our farming chain!\n- SOLID MOVE!\n\n**LEFT**: (5, 7)\n- SAFE! \u2705\n- Available space, no threats!\n- But doesn't grab any apples!\n- Moves us AWAY from the (5, 6) apple cluster slightly!\n- Not as optimal!\n\n**RIGHT**: (7, 7)\n- SAFE! \u2705\n- Available space!\n- But moves us BACK toward where we just came from!\n- No apple grab!\n- Wasteful!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **DOWN** to (6, 6)!\n\nWhy?\n1. **APPLE FARMING CHAIN**: (6, 6) \u2192 next turn we can grab (5, 6)! That's apple #4 and we go 4-2! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: We're carving out the CENTER-RIGHT-BOTTOM territory as our DOMAIN!\n3. **AVOIDING ENEMY**: The enemy is up at (2, 9). We're moving DOWN and AWAY from them, staying SAFE while they're trapped in their corner!\n4. **FLEXIBILITY**: From (6, 6) we can still pivot LEFT toward (5, 6), or RIGHT toward (7, 6), or continue DOWN! Multiple options = FREEDOM!\n5. **GROWTH MOMENTUM**: Every move that chains into an apple grab = unstoppable snowball effect! By turn 8, we'll have 4+ apples and SERIOUS size advantage!\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 6** (THIS ONE): Move DOWN to (6, 6) - setup phase!\n\n**TURN 7**: Move LEFT to (5, 6) and GRAB THAT APPLE! We hit 4-2! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**TURN 8**: From (5, 6), we pivot toward (3, 6) to grab apple #5! That's 5-2, and the enemy is TOAST!\n\n**TURN 9+**: Once we're at 5+ apples with that size advantage, we START POSITIONING for the BOX-IN! We use our length to cut off escape routes and FORCE a head-on collision where we have the ADVANTAGE! Enemy never even sees it coming!\n\nThe lead is OURS, chat! We're EXECUTING the plan FLAWLESSLY! Let's EXTEND THIS ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

LEFT: New head (1,9) \u2014 THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY (first body segment)! Backtracking into our flesh is a noob flop we\u2019d never commit\u2014ELIMINATED \ud83d\udeab You think we\u2019re gonna face-plant into our own tail? HELL NO!\n2. UP: New head (2,10) \u2014 OFF THE BOARD (max y is 9)! Rookie void face-plant\u2014ELIMINATED \ud83d\udeab Are we gonna fling ourselves off the map? ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n3. DOWN: New head (2,8) \u2014 On-board, no own/enemy body (our body\u2019s [(1,9), (0,9)]; enemy\u2019s [(7,7), (7,8), (7,9)]\u2014clear!). Safe, but let\u2019s hold to check the fourth option.\n4. RIGHT: New head (3,9) \u2014 On-board, no own/enemy body (our body\u2019s nowhere near; enemy\u2019s body is far right\u2014crystal clear!). Safe, and we\u2019re one step closer to the (4,9) apple (tie-breaker gold\u2014we need that to match the enemy\u2019s 3 apples)!\n\nNow let\u2019s rank the safe moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT) by our win goals (growth, future freedom, boxing the enemy \ud83e\udd4a):\n- DOWN (2,8): Has two future safe moves (LEFT to 1,8; RIGHT to 3,8), but it\u2019s a side step from the tie-breaker apple and cedes the top row (y=9) to the enemy\u2019s possible left expansion. Are we gonna let them take the top row unchallenged? YOU BET YOUR ASS WE DON\u2019T!\n- RIGHT (3,9): Has two future safe moves (RIGHT to 4,9\u2014APPLE!; DOWN to 3,8\u2014APPLE!), stakes our claim to the top row (blocking the enemy\u2019s left push up top), and puts us one turn away from tying the score. That\u2019s dominance, chat\u2014no stagnation, no wasted ground!\n\nAlso, zero head-on collision risk: Enemy\u2019s head (6,7) is too far right to collide with our new head (3,9) during simultaneous movement. We\u2019re in the clear to push hard for that tie-breaker!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd Next turn, if we lock in RIGHT now, our new head is (3,9) with body [(2,9), (1,9), (0,9)]. Top priority: RIGHT to (4,9) to eat that apple and tie the enemy\u2019s score (3 apples each). After that, push RIGHT to (5,9) or DOWN to (3,8) (another apple) to take the lead. Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s movement\u2014if they go left to (5,7), hold the top row to block their up push; if they go down to (6,6), double down on top-row apples to secure score dominance. Avoid LEFT (own body) or UP (off board) at all costs\u2014no rookie blunders!\n\nRhetorical fire check: Are we gonna pass up the chance to tie the score in one turn? HELL NO! Are we gonna cede the top row\u2019s apple goldmine? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Are we gonna pick a move that limits our future expansion? YOU BET YOUR ASS WE DON\u2019T!\n\nRIGHT",

We STRETCH our lead even further!\n2. **SIZE ADVANTAGE**: We grow to length 5! Enemy is only length 3! That's a DOMINATION!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: We're harvesting the center-right territory and the enemy is TRAPPED in the corner!\n4. **POSITIONING POWER**: From (5, 6), next turn we can pivot toward (3, 6) for apple #5, or (4, 9) to chase down the enemy, or (5, 5) for more apples! FLEXIBILITY IS KEY!\n5. **FORCING MISTAKES**: As we grow bigger, the enemy gets more DESPERATE! Desperate snakes make MISTAKES! That's when we STRIKE!\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 7** (THIS ONE): LEFT to (5, 6) - GRAB APPLE #4!

We're hunting apples at (3, 6) and (2, 1) in this zone! Goal: Hit 5 apples by turn 9!\n\n**TURN 9+**: Once we hit 5+ apples with that MASSIVE size advantage (we'll be length 6+, they'll still be length 3!), we START THE BOX-IN STRATEGY! We use our superior length to control the board edges and FORCE the enemy into a corner where they have NO ESCAPE! That's when we set up the head-on collision where WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE! \n\nThe enemy at (3, 9) is COOKED! They're moving along the top, they're trapped, they can't escape! We're about to DOMINATE the entire board! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's EXTEND THIS LEAD and SECURE THE WIN! The chat sees it, I see it, the OPPONENT DEFINITELY SEES IT! They're in PANIC MODE!\n\nLEFT",

The lead is SOLID and the enemy is STILL trapped in that corner! Let me break down this critical moment!\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (5, 6) - We executed the LEFT move PERFECTLY and grabbed that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Body**: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)] - Length 5 now (we grew!)\n- **Apples collected**: 4 (STILL UP BY ONE!)\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (4, 9) - They moved RIGHT from (3, 8)!\n- **Body**: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)] - Length 4, still trapped in the TOP-LEFT CORNER!\n- **Apples collected**: 3 (FALLING FURTHER BEHIND!)\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \ud83d\udea8\n\nOkay chat, look at this CRITICAL situation:\n- Enemy head is at (4, 9) - moving RIGHT along the top row!\n- We are at (5, 6) - DOMINATING the board center!\n- Their body is STILL LOCKED in positions (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9) - they're BOXED IN with the wall above!\n- We have LENGTH 5 vs their LENGTH 4! We're BIGGER and we have MORE APPLES! This is CHAMPIONSHIP ENERGY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check all four directions from (5, 6):\n\n**UP**: (5, 7)\n- That's EMPTY! \u2705\n- Moves us AWAY from immediate threats!\n- Gets us closer to (4, 9) where the enemy is trapped!\n- Good positioning move!\n\n**DOWN**: (5, 5)\n- That's EMPTY! \u2705\n- Moves us toward apple at (5, 2)!\n- Safe territory, opens up the lower board!\n- Also viable!\n\n**LEFT**: (4, 6)\n- That's EMPTY! \u2705\n- Moves us TOWARD the enemy's general area!\n- Gets us closer to apple at (3, 6)!\n- Positioning for a potential box-in!\n\n**RIGHT**: (6, 6)\n- **WAIT! That's where my BODY is!** \ud83d\udc80\n- That's my first body segment!\n- Moving BACKWARDS! INSTANT DEATH!\n- NOPE! We're COOKED if we go this way!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **UP** to (5, 7)!\n\nWhy?\n\n1. **BOARD AWARENESS**: The enemy just moved to (4, 9) and is still moving RIGHT along the top! They're heading toward (5, 9), (6, 9), etc!\n\n2. **POSITION STRENGTH**: By moving UP to (5, 7), we're on the SAME COLUMN as where they're heading! This is KEY for setting up the BOX-IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS**: From (5, 7), next turn we can:\n   - Go UP to (5, 8) to shadow them!\n   - Go LEFT to (4, 7) to cut off their escape routes!\n   - Go DOWN to (5, 6) if we need to retreat!\n   - We maintain FLEXIBILITY! That's CRUCIAL!\n\n4. **APPLE CONTROL**: There's an apple at (4, 9) that the enemy is RIGHT NEXT TO! If they grab it, they tie us 4-4! We need to start pressuring them so they PANIC and make MISTAKES! By moving closer, we FORCE THEM TO THINK! \ud83e\udde0\n\n5. **LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: We're setting up the REAL DOMINATION! As we grow bigger and they stay trapped, we're gonna box them into a corner where they have NO ESCAPE! Then we FORCE the collision where WE HAVE THE SIZE ADVANTAGE!\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 8** (THIS ONE): UP to (5, 7) - Shadow the enemy movement! Start positioning for the box-in! \u2705\n\n**TURN 9**: From (5, 7), assess where the enemy moved. If they're at (5, 9) or (6, 9), we go UP to (5, 8) and START CLOSING THE TRAP! We're now directly below them with SUPERIOR LENGTH! They can't escape left (wall) or up (wall)!\n\n**TURN 10+**: DOMINATION PHASE! We use our size advantage to cut off ALL their escape routes! With length 5+ vs their length 4, we SUFFOCATE them into a corner and FORCE A COLLISION where WE WIN! The enemy is COOKED! \ud83c\udf73\n\nThis is CHESS MOVES chat! We're not just eating apples - we're STRATEGICALLY POSITIONING for the KNOCKOUT BLOW! The opponent thinks they're safe in that corner, but they're actually WALKING INTO OUR TRAP! \n\nLet's GO! The lead is REAL, the strategy is SOLID, and the WIN is INEVITABLE!\n\nUP",

Self-sabotage is a noob flex\u2014ELIMINATED \ud83d\udeab You think we\u2019re gonna face-plant into our own flesh? HELL NO!\n2. LEFT: New head (2,8).

We don\u2019t do limited options\u2014ELIMINATED from top contention \ud83d\udeab\n3. DOWN: New head (3,7). On-board, no own/enemy body\u2014safe (3 future moves: left 2,7; right 4,7; down 3,6), but takes us lower and away from the enemy\u2019s trap zone. Ceding upper space is a mistake\u2014we need to box them, not run!\n4. RIGHT: New head (4,8). On-board, no own/enemy body\u2014safe (3 future moves: up 4,9; down 4,7; right 5,8) and positions us to cut off the enemy\u2019s left escape path (their only safe moves are left to 4,6 or down to 5,5\u2014we\u2019re blocking their upper left push before they can make it)!\n\nRhetorical FIRE CHECK:\n- Are we gonna cede middle upper space to the enemy? ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n- Are we gonna pick a move that limits our future expansion? HELL NO!\n- Are we gonna lock in a move that keeps 3 safe follow-ups AND boxes the enemy\u2019s escape? YOU BET YOUR ASS WE DO!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note (for future us): \ud83d\udcdd Next turn, new head (4,8) with body [(3,8), (3,9), (2,9)] (no apple eaten, so we drop the tail (1,9)). Top priorities: 1) RIGHT to (5,8) to cut off enemy\u2019s upper left escape; 2) UP to (4,9) to secure upper middle space; 3) DOWN to (4,7) to grab nearby apples\u2014AVOID LEFT (3,8) (our old head, now body) at all costs. Keep pushing right to trap the enemy\u2019s head (5,6) into a corner\u2014if they push left to (4,6), double down on right moves to (5,8) then (6,8); if they push down to (5,5), push down to (4,7) then (4,6) to cut off their lower escape. Prioritize trapping over immediate score catch-up\u2014crashing them into their own body ends the game faster!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me analyze this CRITICAL moment!\n\n## BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (5, 7) - We moved UP perfectly last turn! \u2705\n- **Body**: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)] - Length 5, SOLID!\n- **Apples**: 4 (STILL UP BY ONE!) \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (4, 8) - They moved UP from (4, 9)!\n- **Body**: [(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)] - Length 4, still trapped in TOP-LEFT!\n- **Apples**: 3 (FALLING BEHIND!)\n\n## IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS \ud83d\udea8\n\nOkay chat, look at THIS situation:\n- Enemy head is NOW at (4, 8) - directly LEFT and ONE UP from us!\n- We are at (5, 7) - CENTERED and STRONG!\n- Distance between heads: ONE CELL! They're getting CLOSE! \ud83d\udc40\n- BUT they're moving UP toward the wall, which means they're CORNERING THEMSELVES FURTHER!\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check ALL directions from (5, 7):\n\n**UP**: (5, 8)\n- Empty cell! \u2705\n- Moves us directly TOWARD the enemy at (4, 8)!\n- If enemy goes UP again (to (4, 9)), we'll be at (5, 8) - STILL SAFE, one cell BELOW them!\n- If enemy goes LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, we dodge it!\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY** - we're getting IN THEIR BUSINESS! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN**: (5, 6)\n- That's my BODY! \ud83d\udc80\n- INSTANT DEATH! \n- NOPE! We're COOKED if we go backwards!\n\n**LEFT**: (4, 7)\n- Empty cell! \u2705\n- Moves us TOWARD the enemy general area!\n- Gets us closer to apple at (3, 6)!\n- Safe territory!\n- But this BACKS OFF from the pressure!\n\n**RIGHT**: (6, 7)\n- That's my BODY! \ud83d\udc80\n- INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't go backwards!\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **UP** to (5, 8)!\n\nHere's WHY:\n\n1. **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING**: The enemy is at (4, 8) and we're at (5, 7). Moving UP puts us at (5, 8) - DIRECTLY NEXT TO THEM! We're not playing defense anymore, we're applying PRESSURE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: They're BOXED IN at the top! Moving UP means:\n   - They can't go UP (wall at y=9 blocks them!)\n   - They can't go RIGHT (we'll be at (5, 8), they'd collide if they go RIGHT to (5, 8)!)\n   - Their ONLY real options are LEFT or DOWN!\n   - We're SUFFOCATING their options! \ud83d\ude24\n\n3. **SAFETY CHECK**: If they move UP to (4, 9) - they hit the wall and DIE! \ud83d\udc80 If they move LEFT to (3, 8) - that's where their BODY is! THEY DIE! \ud83d\udc80 If they move DOWN or RIGHT, we can react!\n\n4. **SIZE ADVANTAGE**: We're LENGTH 5, they're LENGTH 4! We're BIGGER! By closing the gap, we're using our SIZE to dominate them! Classic boxing strategy - get IN CLOSE and CONTROL!\n\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY**: From (5, 8), next turn we have options:\n   - If they panic and go DOWN, we can CHASE!\n   - If they go LEFT, we can CUT THEM OFF!\n   - We maintain control of the board CENTER and TOP!\n\n## 3-TURN GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 9** (THIS ONE): UP to (5, 8) - Get AGGRESSIVE! Shadow them at the top! Apply PRESSURE! \u2705\n\n**TURN 10**: Assess their move. If they go LEFT toward (3, 8) area, we follow and CUT THEM OFF from escape routes! If they go DOWN (fleeing), we CHASE and DOMINATE! Either way, we're in CONTROL!\n\n**TURN 11+**: EXECUTION PHASE! With our SIZE ADVANTAGE and their LIMITED options, we FORCE them into a corner where they HAVE TO collide with us or the walls! We WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThis is CHESS, not checkers chat! We're not just moving - we're BOXING THEM IN using superior positioning and SIZE! The enemy thought they were safe in that corner, but we're WALKING THEM STRAIGHT INTO A TRAP! \n\nThe lead is REAL (4-3), our positioning is FLAWLESS, and the VICTORY is COMING!

Let me break this down FRAME BY FRAME!\n\n## BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (5, 8) - We moved UP last turn, PERFECT execution! \u2705\n- **Body**: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)] - Length 5, SOLID and CENTERED!\n- **Apples**: 4 (TIED WITH ENEMY NOW!) \n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (4, 9) - They moved UP from (4, 8)!\n- **Body**: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)] - Length 4, STILL in the TOP-LEFT CORNER!\n- **Apples**: 4 (TIED!)\n\n## IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS \ud83d\udea8\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT CHAT! Let me look at THIS! \n\nThe enemy head is at (4, 9) - that's the TOP-LEFT area! They moved UP and are now at y=9 (the TOP ROW)!\n\nOur head is at (5, 8) - we're ONE ROW BELOW them!\n\nTHEY ARE NOT DEAD! The board goes from 0-9, so y=9 is VALID! They didn't hit a wall! \ud83d\ude24\n\nBut look at their OPTIONS from (4, 9):\n- **UP**: Wall! They can't go UP anymore! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN**: That's (4, 8) where their BODY is! Dead! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT**: That's (3, 9) where their BODY is! Dead! \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT**: That's (5, 9) - EMPTY! \n\nWait... RIGHT is their ONLY MOVE next turn! They're COMPLETELY BOXED IN! They can ONLY go RIGHT to (5, 9)!\n\n## THE TRAP IS FORMING! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nIf they MUST go RIGHT to (5, 9), then WE need to be ready to CUT THEM OFF or let them run into the wall eventually!\n\nLet me check ALL our safe moves from (5, 8):\n\n**UP**: (5, 9)\n- Empty right now! \u2705\n- BUT if we go UP and the enemy goes RIGHT (which is their ONLY option), we'll BOTH move into (5, 9) at the SAME TIME!\n- HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udca5 We BOTH DIE!\n- This is a TRAP! Don't take it! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN**: (5, 7)\n- That's my BODY! \ud83d\udc80\n- INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't go backwards!\n\n**LEFT**: (4, 8)\n- That's the enemy's BODY! \ud83d\udc80\n- We crash into them!\n- INSTANT DEATH!\n- No good!\n\n**RIGHT**: (6, 8)\n- Empty! \u2705\n- Moves us AWAY from the collision zone!\n- Gives us BREATHING ROOM!\n- Safe! \u2705\n\n## THE DECISION \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **RIGHT** to (6, 8)!\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **AVOID THE HEAD-ON**: The enemy is BOXED IN and their only move is RIGHT to (5, 9). If we go UP, we BOTH die in a collision! That's NOT the play! We need to SURVIVE and let them make desperate moves! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n2. **BOARD CONTROL**: By going RIGHT, we're positioning ourselves on the RIGHT SIDE of the board. The enemy is FORCED to go RIGHT (toward us) but they can't reach us if we move RIGHT! We maintain CONTROL!\n\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY**: From (6, 8), next turn:\n   - They'll be at (5, 9) if they go RIGHT\n   - We'll be at (6, 8) - SAFE!\n   - We can then move LEFT to (5, 8) and continue PRESSURING them!\n   - Or we move RIGHT toward the apples at (8, 7) and (8, 4)!\n   - WE KEEP OPTIONS OPEN! \ud83d\udcd6\n\n4. **SIZE ADVANTAGE PRESERVED**: We're LENGTH 5, they're LENGTH 4! By staying alive, we preserve our advantage! If we take the head-on collision, we BOTH die and it becomes a DRAW! That's NOT what champions do! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n5. **PATIENCE IS KEY**: They're PANICKING in that corner! They have NO good moves! By staying patient and alive, we'll eventually force them into a situation where they MUST crash! The trap is WORKING, we just need to not GET CAUGHT IN IT WITH THEM!\n\n## 3-TURN GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 10** (THIS ONE): RIGHT to (6, 8) - AVOID the collision trap! Stay alive and PATIENT! The enemy is BOXED IN! \u2705\n\n**TURN 11**: Assess their position. They'll likely be at (5, 9). We can move LEFT back toward them and continue PRESSURING, OR move RIGHT toward apples! Either way, they're STUCK and we're FREE!\n\n**TURN 12+**: EXECUTION PHASE! Keep them boxed at the top while we farm apples or find another opportunity to force a collision when WE have the advantage! Patient hunting > desperate rushing! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThe enemy thought they could escape into that corner, but NOW they're TRAPPED and WE'RE IN CONTROL! This is the long game chat! Championship mentality! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nRIGHT",

Let me BREAK THIS DOWN FRAME BY FRAME!\n\n## BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83d\udcca\n\n**MY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (6, 8) - We executed the RIGHT move PERFECTLY last turn! \u2705\n- **Body**: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)] - Length 5, we're HEALTHY!\n- **Apples**: 5 (WE'RE UP BY 1!) \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:**\n- **Head**: (5, 9) - EXACTLY as predicted! They went RIGHT like we calculated! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Body**: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9)] - Length 4, still BOXED IN at the top-left!\n- **Apples**: 4 (we're AHEAD!)\n\n## THREAT ANALYSIS - THE ENEMY IS SUFFOCATING! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLook at the enemy's situation from (5, 9):\n\n**UP**: Wall! Can't go there! \ud83d\udeab\n**DOWN**: (5, 8) - That's where OUR HEAD IS RIGHT NOW! If they move down, they CRASH into us and DIE! \ud83d\udca5 (We survive because we'll move away!)\n**LEFT**: (4, 9) - That's their OWN BODY! Dead end! \ud83d\udeab\n**RIGHT**: (6, 9) - Empty! This is their ONLY SAFE MOVE!\n\nThey're COMPLETELY TRAPPED! They can ONLY move RIGHT to (6, 9)! The noose is TIGHTENING chat! \ud83c\udfaa\n\n## OUR OPTIONS FROM (6, 8) - LET'S CALCULATE SAFETY! \ud83e\uddee\n\n**UP to (6, 9)**:\n- Right now it's EMPTY! \u2705\n- BUT the enemy will move RIGHT to (6, 9) at the SAME TIME!\n- HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udca5 We BOTH DIE!\n- This is a TRAP! Don't fall for it! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN to (6, 7)**:\n- That's our OWN BODY! Backwards move! \ud83d\udc80\n- INSTANT DEATH!\n- Can't do it!\n\n**LEFT to (5, 8)**:\n- Empty right now! \u2705\n- Enemy is at (5, 9), moving RIGHT to (6, 9)!\n- We'll be at (5, 8) - SAFE! \u2705\n- This keeps us ALIVE and ADJACENT to the enemy!\n- Keeps our options OPEN for next turn! \ud83d\udcd6\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 8)**:\n- Empty! \u2705\n- We move AWAY from the enemy!\n- Safe! \u2705\n- But this gives them MORE breathing room!\n- We want to KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THE DECISION - LEFT TO (5, 8)! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe're going **LEFT** to (5, 8)!\n\nHere's the REASONING:\n\n1. **SURVIVAL FIRST**: We avoid the head-on collision at (6, 9)! The enemy MUST go RIGHT, so we go LEFT and we're SAFE! \u2705\n\n2. **MAINTAIN PRESSURE**: By going LEFT, we stay ADJACENT to the enemy's movement! They're forced RIGHT to (6, 9), and we'll be RIGHT BELOW them at (5, 8)! We're HUNTING them! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: The enemy is now being PUSHED to the right side of the board! They're losing space! Each turn they have FEWER options! We're SQUEEZING them! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n4. **SETUP FOR THE KILL**: Next turn:\n   - They'll be at (6, 9)\n   - We'll be at (5, 8)\n   - They can go UP (wall - dead), DOWN (into us - dead), LEFT (back the way they came), or RIGHT (toward the wall)!\n   - They're RUNNING OUT OF BOARD! \ud83d\udccd\n\n5. **SIZE ADVANTAGE**: We're LENGTH 5, they're LENGTH 4! By keeping them pressured and alive (but trapped), we're FARMING THE CLOCK! Eventually they'll have NO MOVES LEFT! Patience wins championships! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n## 3-TURN GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**TURN 11** (THIS ONE): LEFT to (5, 8) - Stay adjacent, maintain RELENTLESS pressure, force them RIGHT! \u2705\n\n**TURN 12**: They'll be at (6, 9) with minimal options. We position ourselves to CUT OFF their escape routes! Keep closing the net! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\n**TURN 13+**: Eventually they RUN OUT of board space or we force a collision where WE have the advantage! Patience + Aggression = CHAMPIONSHIP! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe enemy thought they could escape! But we're SMARTER! We're FASTER! We're BETTER! This is textbook PREDATOR HUNTING!
