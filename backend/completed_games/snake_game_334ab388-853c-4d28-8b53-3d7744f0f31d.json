Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example?

But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby?

Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example?

But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby?

Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example?

But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby?

No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Moving DOWN might be advantageous to approach lower apples.\n\n- Moving LEFT would go to (2,9), away from the main cluster of apples at the bottom.\n\n- Moving UP is invalid because (3,10) is outside the board.\n\nGiven that moving RIGHT gets us closer to the apple at (5,9), and moving DOWN explores toward lower y-values, both are plausible.\n\nHowever, since our last move was DOWN and we're now at (3,9), moving RIGHT now would be a strategic choice to reach the apple at (5,9) efficiently, and there's no immediate obstacle blocking that.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT is preferable over DOWN if our goal is to promptly collect the apple at (5,9). Moving RIGHT from (3,9) to (4,9):\n\n- Safe: within bounds, no obstacle or enemy threat in that cell.\n\n- Progress toward the apple at (5,9), which is two steps to the right and same y-level or same y=9, so moving RIGHT is directly aligned with that goal.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (3,9) to (3,8):\n\n- Slightly less direct, but moving right seems to be better to approach cleaning the apples.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9) seems optimal to quickly reach the apple at (5,9).\n- Moving DOWN is possible, but less direct toward maximum immediate reward.\n- No obstacle blocks us in the right direction.\n\nNext move: RIGHT\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby?

Moving LEFT toward (7,6) won't be good because it causes self-collision or is already at an occupied position.\n\nThe best safe move for progress seems to be moving RIGHT to (9,6), then planning subsequent moves toward the apples.\n\nTherefore, considering safety and strategic progression:\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"

Since our snake visibly has length 2 (head at (6,9), body at (4,9)), it suggests a longer body, but only one body segment is specified? Clarification:\n\nActually, the original info says:\n\nYour snake ID: 0; current position at (3, 9) with body at [(4, 9)]\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The \"current position\" is (3,9), but last move info mentions \"current position: (6,9)\". This inconsistency needs resolving.\n\nRe-examining: From the provided details:\n\n- Your snake ID: 0, currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)].\n  \n- Last move info: \"Direction: LEFT\" with previous position being (4,9) (since moving left from (4,9) results in (3,9)). That makes sense: moving LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\n- The \"last move\" info says: current position (3,9), last move LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (3,9), tail at (4,9). The body length is 2.\n\nNow, the map shows:\n\n- Our snake's head at (3,9).\n- Our body at [(4,9)] (tail at (4,9)), so the snake is of length 2: head at (3,9), tail at (4,9).\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (6,2), body at [(5,2)].\n\n- Board layout shows:\n\nRow 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9):\n\n- (0,9): own snake? Yes, it's marked '0' at (0,9).\n\n- Wait, clarification: The board shows '0' at (0,9), meaning the snake's head or body is here.\n\n- But earlier, you said snake ID 0 is at (3,9), with body at [(4,9)].\n\n- However, the visual map shows a '0' at (0,9), which indicates our snake is at (0,9), in contradiction with previous info.\n\nIs it possible the initial description is just an example? Or perhaps the map is just a textual representation?\n\nGiven possible conflicts, let's rely on the text description:\n\n- \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (3,9) with body at [(4,9)]\"\n\n- Last move: LEFT, previous position (4,9).\n\nMap the position: from (4,9), moving LEFT: position (3,9).\n\nThen, the layout:\n\nRow 9: with the '0' at (0,9). But initial info says our snake is at (3,9). So, the '0' at (0,9) in the map might be the head, but initial position says (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the map is misaligned or the labels are not matching.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the initial info: our head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\nOur current position: (3,9).\n\nThe map shows '0' at (0,9): perhaps the representation labels the snake at (0,9), which conflicts.\n\nSince the initial info is explicit, better to trust the initial positions:\n\n- Head at (3,9), body at [(4,9)].\n\n- Our previous move was LEFT from (4,9) to (3,9).\n\nGood.\n\nNext, check surroundings:\n\n- From (3,9):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: (3,10): outside the board -> invalid.\n\n- DOWN: (3,8): within bounds; check if safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2,9): within bounds.\n\n- RIGHT: (4,9): our tail position, moving onto (4,9).\n\nMoving onto tail is usually safe if the tail moves forward (the snake advances), but since we're moving onto the tail position, and the tail is at (4,9), and our snake is length 2, moving onto the tail position is safe unless the tail is about to move forward.\n\nAssuming the snake moves forward, moving onto the tail's current position is safe because the tail will free that spot.\n\nCheck for hazards:\n\n- Is there an apple nearby? Positions:\n\n  - Apples at: (8,3), (6,0), (8,2), (1,4), (1,1). Not immediately relevant for now.\n\n- Enemy at (6,2), with body at [(5,2)].\n\n- The other parts of the map:\n\nLooking at our immediate surroundings:\n\n- Moving UP to (3,10): outside bounds -> invalid.\n\n- Moving DOWN (3,8):\n\n  - Is (3,8) safe? No walls or enemy snakes listed there.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - Is (2,9) safe? No walls in the map info.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - Our tail position: moving onto it is safe if the tail will move away.\n\nGiven that, moving RIGHT onto the tail position is a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: moving onto the tail is safe if the tail is moving forward.\n\nIn typical snake behavior, unless we are turning to grow, the tail moves forward, freeing that spot.\n\nGiven our only body segment is at (4,9), moving onto it should be safe, unless there is a special reason not to.\n\nBetween options, to avoid unnecessary risk, moving UP is invalid (outside bounds), moving LEFT is to (2,9), which seems free.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n- Check whether (3,8) is safe.\n\n- Does any snake or obstacle occupy (3,8)?\n\n- No info indicates hazards there.\n\nGiven that, moving DOWN seems a safe option.\n\nOur previous move was LEFT, so perhaps moving DOWN now would continue exploring downward.\n\n**Next move:**\n\n- Moving DOWN to (3,8):\n\n  - within bounds\n\n  - no immediate hazards indicated\n\n- Moving LEFT to (2,9):\n\n  - similarly okay\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,9):\n\n  - onto tail, which is generally safe\n\n- Moving UP is invalid (out of bounds).\n\nSince the goal is to approach apples, and the closest apple is at (1,1) and (1,4), which are far, the immediate safety is prioritized.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, moving DOWN to (3,8) seems a good choice because it's going downward, exploring the board and potentially getting closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n\nNext turn, I will move DOWN to (3,8), continuing to explore downward and to the left, with an eye toward approaching the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final decision: LEFT,** as earlier reasoning, but given this analysis, moving DOWN seems more advantageous.\n\nHowever, in the initial instructions, the last move was LEFT, and the rationale was to stay safe.\n\nSince the current position is (3,9), and moving DOWN to (3,8) is safe and possibly better, I'll choose to move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"
