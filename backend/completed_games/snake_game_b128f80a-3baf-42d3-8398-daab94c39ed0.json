Both are safe: no wall, no snake, no apple so no immediate point.\n\nBut, moving RIGHT puts me directly along the same x as the closest apple; from there I can head DOWN twice to get to the apple. So, going RIGHT might set me up for a straightforward path.\n\nConsider if anyone can \"cut me off\".

T . . . . .   (row 1, my tail)\n0 . . . 0 1 . . . . A   (row 0, enemy at (3,0), me at (4,0), apple at (9,0))\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n---\n\n### **Immediate Concerns**\n- I occupy (4,0) (head) and (4,1) (tail).\n- **Enemy at (3,0), RIGHT next to me on the left.**\n    - If enemy goes RIGHT, they hit my head and die.\n    - If I go LEFT, I hit enemy and die.\n    - If I go UP, to (4,1), that's my own tail, which will move forward unless I just grew. But since I ate an apple, my tail stays, so I'd hit my own tail and die if I go UP.\n    - If I go DOWN, that's off the board.\n    - If I go RIGHT, that's (5,0), open.\n\n**Critical note:** I just ate an apple at (4,0), so my tail remains in place this turn. That means (4,1) is still occupied. Moving UP would result in running into my own tail!\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluate All Possible Moves from (4,0):**\n- **UP (4,1):** Occupied by my tail THIS TURN due to growth. Unsafe\u2014DEATH.\n- **DOWN (4,-1):** Off board\u2014DEATH.\n- **LEFT (3,0):** Enemy snake's head\u2014DEATH.\n- **RIGHT (5,0):** Safe. No wall or snake.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Proximity** (from (5,0) after RIGHT move):\n- (9,0): |9-5| + |0-0| = 4\n- (4,3): 1+3=4\n- (5,8): 0+8=8\n- (6,8): 1+8=9\n- (3,9): 2+9=11\n\n(9,0) and (4,3) both at distance 4. But after moving RIGHT, I'll be closer to (9,0).\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Snake Potential Moves**\n- Enemy at (3,0) could go UP (safe), LEFT (safe), or RIGHT (into me\u2014unsafe).\n- They are unlikely to go RIGHT into me; probably they go UP or LEFT, away from me.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Options**\n- ONLY safe move: **RIGHT to (5,0)**\n    - All other moves are instant death.\n\n---\n\n## **Next Move and Strategy**\n- **Move:** RIGHT to (5,0).\n- **Next turn:** Reassess apple targets. Since (9,0) is closest from here, probably keep heading that way unless enemy snake is chasing the same apple.\n    - As I grow, be mindful of the tail and not doubling back.\n    - Watch enemy snake's path in next turn\u2014if they chase (9,0), consider (4,3) next.\n\n---\n\n**Move: RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n**(Tell myself next turn:)**\n- Unless threat arises on the bottom, keep heading for (9,0).\n- Avoid my own body as I grow.\n- Keep track of enemy's position, especially near apples.\n\n---\n\n**Final move decision:**  \n**RIGHT**"

It is on the board and an open space.\n\n#### **DOWN: (5,-1)**\n- This is off the board. DEATH.\n\n#### **LEFT: (4,0)**\n- This is your own body (your tail is still at (4,0) because you just grew!), so you\u2019d hit yourself and die.\n\n#### **RIGHT: (6,0)**\n- Is (6,0) free? (yes)\n- On the board. No body there. Also an open space.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Safe Moves**\n- **UP (5,1):** Safe, empty.\n- **RIGHT (6,0):** Safe, empty.\n- **LEFT & DOWN:** Not safe (hit self or wall).\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Distances From Each Move**\n\n#### If you go **RIGHT (6,0)**:\n- To (9,0): |9-6| + |0-0| = 3 moves\n- To (4,3): |4-6| + |3-0| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves\n\n#### If you go **UP (5,1)**:\n- To (4,3): |4-5| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves\n- To (9,0): |9-5| + |0-1| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Snake Considerations**\n- Enemy is now at (3,1), 2 squares left (X=3) and 1 up (Y=1)\n    - If they chase (9,0) apple, they will have to cross you or circle a long way.\n    - If you go RIGHT, you continue a clear path toward (9,0).\n    - If you go UP, you pivot closer to (4,3), but could put you more into the interior, potentially more danger of boxing self in as you grow.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-term Planning & Growth**\n- It\u2019s safest to HUG THE WALL and approach (9,0); gives more room as you grow, makes path predictable, and minimizes self-blocking.\n- If you go UP now, you would have to go diagonally up and then left to get to (4,3) as your next apple, but you\u2019re also closer to the center, giving more options if the enemy starts coming for southern apples.\n- Going RIGHT keeps you on the bottom, with a clear, short path to (9,0). You\u2019ll have two body segments behind you (5,0) and (4,0), so after eating the apple, you\u2019ll want to head up or left, depending on the board state.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBOTH RIGHT and UP are safe.  \n- **RIGHT** is better for consistent apple gathering with less risk, and maintains wall hugging.\n- **UP** could be a strategic shift to central apples, but with more risk as you grow.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Note for Next Turn**\n- After reaching (9,0), evaluate going UP toward (6,8) or (5,8), or circling back toward central apples.\n- Always avoid doubling back on own tail, especially just after eating.\n- Continue to monitor enemy snake, but their distance is such that focusing on closest apples is primary.\n\n---\n\n## **Decision:**\n\n**Move: RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n**Next turn strategy:**  \n- If you get to (9,0), plan to move up toward the next available apples at (6,8) or (5,8).\n- Continue to watch your own tail after eating, and avoid risky pivots while short.\n- Check enemy\u2019s position in case they're heading for apples in your row or column.\n\n**Final move decision:**  \n**RIGHT**"
