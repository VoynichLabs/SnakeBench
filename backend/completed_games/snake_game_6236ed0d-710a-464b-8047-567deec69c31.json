This move is not an option.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 2, 0):**\n   - Moves directly towards the closest apple at (2, 0), allowing me to eat it and grow the snake.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 0, 0):**\n   - Moves away from the closest apple at (2, 0), providing no strategic gain.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 1, -1):**\n   - This would result in a wall collision since it's outside the grid bounds (negative y-coordinate), making it an invalid move.\n\n### Strategic Analysis and Planning:\n\n- **Immediate Goal:** Capture the apple at (2, 0) to grow the snake and gain a point.\n- **Avoidable Hazards:**\n  - Avoid UP since it leads to self-collision.\n  - Avoid going outside the grid bounds.\n- **Future Considerations:**\n  - After collecting the apple at (2, 0), reassess the board state to plan for the next closest apple. Likely targets would be apples at (4, 2) or along the bottom edge (6, 0) or (5, 0).\n  - Keep my movements flexible and avoid getting trapped against walls or boxed into a corner.\n\n### Conclusion & Next Move:\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 0) is optimal as it allows me to collect the apple and safely grow my snake with no immediate threats.\n\n**My next move is: RIGHT**"
