UP: (5,10) - Invalid (off board)\n2. DOWN: (5,8) - Invalid (enemy body at (5,8))\n3. LEFT: (4,9) - Valid (empty space)\n4. RIGHT: (6,9) - Invalid (my own body)\n\nSafe moves: LEFT\n\nEvaluation:\n- LEFT to (4,9) is the only safe move available\n- This moves us away from the enemy's body and toward the center of the board\n- We should avoid moving into the dense enemy body in the top-left area\n- After this move, we'll need to plan our next move carefully to reach apples like (4,7) or (9,8)\n\nStrategy note for future self:\n- After moving LEFT to (4,9), we'll be positioned near the enemy's body but with more space to maneuver\n- We should look for opportunities to move toward the apple at (4,7) which is relatively close\n- Be cautious of the enemy snake's potential moves and avoid head-on collisions\n- Consider future moves that keep us away from the dense enemy body while still allowing us to reach apples\n\nLEFT",
