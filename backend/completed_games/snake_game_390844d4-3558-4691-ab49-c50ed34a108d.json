Possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. UP is suicide (9+1=10, out of bounds).\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves for Snake 1: (6, 9)\n\n**1. Move UP:** (6, 10) -> **Invalid (Out of bounds)**\n\n**2. Move DOWN:** (6, 8)\n*   Safety Check: (6, 8) is on the board. Snake 1 body is empty, so no self-collision. Enemy head (5, 1) is far away. This move is safe.\n*   Apple Proximity: Nearest apple is (6, 6) or (4, 7). Moving to (6, 8) is a step towards (6, 6) or generally towards the center.\n\n**3. Move LEFT:** (5, 9)\n*   Safety Check: (5, 9) is on the board. No self-collision. Enemy head (5, 1) is far away. This move is safe.\n*   Apple Proximity: Moving towards the top-left cluster of apples (0, 8), (4, 7).\n\n**4. Move RIGHT:** (7, 9)\n*   Safety Check: (7, 9) is on the board. No self-collision. Enemy head (5, 1) is far away. This move is safe.\n*   Apple Proximity: Moving away from the main cluster of apples on the left side, but maintaining central position.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration (Snake 0 at (5, 1)):**\nSnake 0 will choose a move. Since it is early game and it has no body, it has many safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n*   If Snake 0 goes UP to (5, 2), it targets an apple (5, 2).\n*   If Snake 0 goes RIGHT to (6, 1), it moves towards the middle.\n\nSince Snake 1 is at (6, 9) and Snake 0 is at (5, 1), a head-on collision is impossible this turn regardless of our moves, as the minimum distance is large.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n\nDOWN to (6, 8): Keeps immediate vertical access. It brings us one step closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n\nLEFT to (5, 9): Brings us closer to the left side apples (0, 8), (4, 7), (2, 7). It also positions us next to the enemy if the enemy moves towards the top. However, being on the edge (y=9) is generally limiting. Moving away from the edge seems preferable if there is no immediate apple incentive to stay high.\n\nRIGHT to (7, 9): Moves us to the right edge, similar limitation to LEFT, but moving away from the density of apples.\n\nThe apples are distributed:\nA1: (6, 6) - Directly somewhat below.\nA2: (4, 7)\nA3: (0, 8)\nA4: (2, 7)\nA5: (5, 2) - Close to enemy head\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 8) seems like the most direct, central move that prioritizes closure on the nearest visible apple (6, 6) without immediately committing to an edge. If we move DOWN, we are only 2 steps away from (6, 6).\n\nLet's check the path to (6, 6) from (6, 9): DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. If we move DOWN now, we can potentially reach (6, 6) on Turn 3 if the path remains clear.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 9), we are now positioned to move towards the cluster of apples { (4, 7), (2, 7), (0, 8) } on the left side.\n\nGiven the lack of body and no immediate threats, moving centrally and descending towards the nearest apple (6, 6) seems like a prudent opening strategy.\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN to (6, 8).\n\nLong-term plan: Target the nearest apple (6, 6) first, then reassess movement towards the left cluster. Avoid the edges if possible.\n\nStrategy Note: Prioritize closing distance to (6, 6) by moving DOWN for the next few turns, unless a better opportunity arises or the enemy moves aggressively towards this area.\n\nDOWN",

Last turn (Turn 0), Snake 0 was at (5, 1). It moved towards apple (5, 2), so it likely moved UP.)\nApples: (6, 6), (4, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 2)\n\nTurn: 1 / 150\n\nSnake 1 is at (6, 8). Possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**1. Safety Check (Self):**\n*   Body is empty, so no self-collision risk besides moving backwards.\n*   Backwards move: From (6, 8), the head just came from (6, 9). Moving DOWN to (6, 7) is not backwards. All moves are safe from self-collision related to the previous step, as the snake is only 1 cell long currently (if it had just eaten, it would be 2). Since the snake is only 1 segment long (body is empty), any move is safe from self-collision.\n\n**2. Safety Check (Enemy Collision):**\nEnemy Snake 0 head is at (5, 2). Enemy body is at (5, 1).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1:\n*   **UP (6, 9):** Safe from enemy contact.\n*   **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe from enemy contact.\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** This puts the head *adjacent* to the enemy head (5, 2) if the enemy moves far away, but is safe this turn.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe from enemy contact.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Strategy:**\nSnake 0 is at (5, 2) and has 1 apple. It is positioned very close to apple (5, 2) (which it just ate, or it was already there and it moved to it last turn). Since it has 1 apple, its body is now [(5, 1), (5, 2)] if it successfully ate (5, 2) on Turn 0.\n*Correction based on provided data:* Snake #0 *apples: 1*. This means it ate an apple sometime before Turn 1. If it moved UP from (5, 1) to (5, 2) last turn, and (5, 2) was indeed an apple, its current state is Head (5, 2), Body [(5, 1)].\nThe apple list is: (6, 6), (4, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 2). (5, 2) is *not* listed as an available apple in the current list for Turn 1. This suggests Snake 0 ate an apple whose coordinates no longer exist *or* the apple list provided is the set of *remaining* apples, and Snake 0 ate one of them (or a different one not listed perhaps, but assuming the provided apple list is current/complete).\n\nGiven the board state visualization shows an '0' at (5, 2) and an 'A' at (9, 2), and Snake #0 body at (5, 1), it seems most likely Snake 0 moved to (5, 2) and acquired its point. If (5, 2) was *not* an apple, then its move was arbitrary. The board drawing seems to indicate:\nSnake 0 Head: (5, 2)\nSnake 0 Body: (5, 1) (T in the diagram at (5, 1))\nApple A: (9, 2)\n\nIf Snake 0 is at (5, 2) and is safe, we need to look at where it might move next. It's fairly central.\n\n**Target Apples:**\nA1: (6, 6) - 2 steps away (if moving straight down).\nA2: (4, 7) - 1 step diagonal/horizontal distance.\nA4: (2, 7) - Further left.\nA3: (0, 8) - Far left.\nA5: (9, 2) - Far right/down.\n\nFrom (6, 8), moving **DOWN to (6, 7)** moves directly towards (6, 6).\nPath to (6, 6): (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) (Eat on Turn 3 if unimpeded).\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (5, 8)**, we are closer to (4, 7).\nPath to (4, 7): (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 7) (Eat on Turn 4 if unimpeded, or 3 steps if we zig-zag).\n\nThe apple at (6, 6) requires 2 moves DOWN. The move DOWN to (6, 7) keeps us on the central column (C6) and is the most direct progress towards an apple.\n\nLet's check potential threat from Enemy 0 at (5, 2):\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (6, 7): Snake 0 might move towards (6, 6) itself, or towards (4, 7).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (5, 3), it moves away from us.\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 2), it moves towards the bottom right corner, away from us. If it moves LEFT to (4, 2), away.\n\nSince we have no body and the enemy is relatively far vertically, prioritizing the nearest apple along a straight path is often the best opening strategy if safety is guaranteed. (6, 7) is safe.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue moving towards (6, 6) via DOWN moves until we reach it or until an enemy blocks the path or a closer/more strategic opportunity arises.\n\nMy last move was DOWN, resulting in the current position of (6, 8). Moving DOWN again keeps the trajectory toward (6, 6).\n\nDOWN",

Let's assume the provided board state reflects the result of simultaneous moves where: Snake 1 moved DOWN to (6, 7), and Snake 0 moved UP to (5, 3).)\n\nBoard interpretation based on provided data for the start of *this* turn (Turn 2):\nMy Head: (6, 7)\nEnemy 0 Head: (5, 3), Body: [(5, 2)]\n\n**Safety Check & Analysis (Turn 2):**\n\nCurrent Head: (6, 7). Previous position (Head of Turn 1): (6, 8). Backwards move is UP to (6, 8).\n\n**1. Self Safety:**\nSince length is 1, only moving back to (6, 8) is explicitly unsafe if the body was created last turn to be at (6, 8). Since I have 0 apples, my body is empty. If I moved DOWN last turn, I should have moved from (6, 8) to (6, 7). The snake length is 1. Moving UP to (6, 8) is safe as (6, 8) is empty space (no body segment followed the head).\n\n**2. Enemy Safety:**\nEnemy 0 Head at (5, 3). Enemy Body at (5, 2).\n\n*   **UP (6, 8):** Safe. Enemy is at (5, 3).\n*   **DOWN (6, 6):** Safe. Moves directly towards Apple (6, 6). Enemy is at (5, 3).\n*   **LEFT (5, 7):** Safe. Enemy is at (5, 3).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe. Enemy is at (5, 3).\n\n**3. Target Selection:**\nTarget Apple: (6, 6). Distance = 1 step (DOWN).\nOther close Apple: (4, 7). Distance = 1 step Horizontal, 1 step Vertical (diagonal).\n\nMoving **DOWN to (6, 6)** seems optimal as it leads directly to an apple in 1 move, and lands directly on the apple if successful.\n\n**4. Enemy Prediction (If I move DOWN to (6, 6)):**\nSnake 0 is at (5, 3). It needs 3 UP moves to reach my target (6, 6). It is unlikely to intercept me immediately. It might aim for (4, 7) or (2, 7).\n\nIf Snake 0 aims for (4, 7), it could move LEFT to (4, 3) or diagonal moves. If it moves LEFT to (4, 3), it is moving away from my current trajectory. If it moves RIGHT to (6, 3), it is also moving away. If it moves UP to (5, 4), it is positioning centrally.\n\nSince moving DOWN to (6, 6) results in an immediate apple acquisition (assuming no opponent collision on the target cell):\n\n**Collision Check on Target (6, 6):**\n*   My move: (6, 7) -> (6, 6)\n*   Enemy 0 move possibilities from (5, 3): (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (5, 2). None land on (6, 6).\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is safe and maximizes immediate progress.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on eating the nearest apple (6, 6). Once eaten, re-evaluate targets. Maintain distance from Snake 0 at (5, 3) and monitor its trajectory. Since my length is 1, I have maximum maneuverability.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I become length 2, with body at (6, 7). This means my next move cannot be UP to (6, 8).\n\nDOWN is the preferred move.\n\nMy last move was DOWN, which resulted in Head (6, 7). I will choose DOWN again to target (6, 6).\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "The game is on Turn 3. My current head is at (6, 6). My body is at (6, 7). My length is now 2 (1 apple eaten, but the board state shows the head at (6, 6) and body at (6, 7), implying the move that led to this state was DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6), and that apple at (6, 6) was eaten).\n\nLet's re-confirm the current state based on the prompt data:\nTurn: 3 / 150\nApples at: (4, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 2), (7, 3)\nYour snake (ID 1) apples: 1 (Length must be 2)\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 6), Body: [(6, 7)]\n\nThis means my move last turn (Turn 2) was DOWN, moving from (6, 7) to (6, 6), successfully eating the apple that *was* at (6, 6) at the start of Turn 2 (as deduced from the last rationale). My length is 2, body segment is (6, 7). Backwards move is UP to (6, 7), which is now occupied by my first body segment.\n\nEnemy Snake #0: Head: (6, 3), Body: [(5, 3)]. Apples: 1. (Note: The map shows T 0 A at (7, 3) and (6, 3) is occupied by the head. The board diagram is slightly confusing:\nRow 7: . . A . A . T . . . (T at (6, 7) for me, if I hadn't moved yet)\nRow 6: . . . . . . 1 . . . (1 head at (6, 6))\nRow 3: . . . . . T 0 A . . (T at (5, 3) for Snake 0, 0 head at (6, 3)?!)\n\nLet's rely on the explicit text data over the drawing if there's conflict, but the drawing shows Snake 0 head at (6, 3) and body at (5, 3) (implied by T 0 A sequence, where T is body/tail, 0 is head, A is apple. However, the text says: `* Snake #0 - Head: (6, 3), Body: [(5, 3)]`). This means Snake 0 is at (6, 3) and its segment behind it is at (5, 3). This contradicts the board drawing where the '0' marker appears to be at (6, 3) and 'T' at (5, 3) OR the snake structure is represented strangely on the map.\n\nLet's trust the explicit status block for Snake #0: Head (6, 3), Body [(5, 3)]. Length is 2. Snake 0's last segment is at (5, 3).\n\nMy current position: Head (6, 6), Body [(6, 7)].\nMy potential moves from (6, 6):\n1. **UP (6, 7):** Self-collision! (6, 7) is my body segment. **DEAD.**\n2. **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe from self.\n3. **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe from self.\n4. **RIGHT (7, 6):** Safe from self.\n\n**Safety Check (Self):**\nUP is immediately fatal. Must choose DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Safety Check (Enemy 0 at Head (6, 3), Body [(5, 3)]):**\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (6, 5)**:\nEnemy 0 moves from (6, 3). Possible destinations: (5, 3) [Body], (7, 3) [Apple], (6, 4), (6, 2).\n*   Collision with (5, 3) is impossible if Snake 0 moves away from its body segment.\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (7, 3) (Apple), it does not hit me at (6, 5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (6, 4), it does not hit me at (6, 5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (6, 2), it does not hit me at (6, 5).\n*   Head-on collision: Impossible unless Snake 0 moves to (6, 5) which means Snake 0 must move DOWN, but it is moving UP towards (6, 6) or (6, 4). Snake 0 would need to move UP to (6, 4) or (6, 5) to meet me. If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 4), it's 1 cell away. If it moves to (6, 5), it's a collision.\n\nLet's assume Snake 0 follows an aggressive strategy, perhaps aiming for the apple at (7, 3).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 3) (Apple): Safe for me.\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 4): Safe for me.\n\n**If I move DOWN to (6, 5):** This moves me vertically closer to the bottom and potentially towards the apple at (9, 2). It also puts maximum vertical distance between me and Snake 0 (Head at (6, 3)).\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (5, 6)**:\nSnake 0 moves from (6, 3).\n*   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (5, 3), it hits its own body segment [(5, 3)]. Snake 0 dies unless (5, 3) is the cell *behind* the head at (6, 3) only if it moves backwards. Moving from (6, 3) to (5, 3) means Snake 0 is stepping onto its own body segment. **If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (5, 3), Snake 0 dies.**\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (7, 6)**:\nSnake 0 moves from (6, 3).\n*   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 3) (Apple), it's safe.\n\n**Apple Hunting:**\nRemaining apples: (4, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 2), (7, 3).\n\nMy head is at (6, 6).\n*   To (7, 3): Requires moving right/down significantly. Distance ~4 steps.\n*   To (4, 7): Requires moving left/up diagonally. Distance ~3 steps.\n*   To (2, 7): Requires moving left/up significantly. Distance ~5 steps.\n*   To (9, 2): Requires moving right/down significantly. Distance ~5 steps.\n\nThe closest apples are (7, 3) and (4, 7).\n\n**Evaluating LEFT to (5, 6):**\nThis places me adjacent to (4, 7) (Apple). If Snake 0 dies by moving to (5, 3), this is a huge advantage.\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (5, 3), it dies because its body is currently defined as [(5, 3)]. A snake cannot occupy the same cell as its body segment unless that segment just popped free (which only happens if the head eats an apple and the tail segment is removed, or if the snake just moved onto a spot that *used to be* its tail but isn't anymore). Since Snake 0's body *is* (5, 3), moving the head from (6, 3) to (5, 3) constitutes moving into its own body. **Snake 0 dies if it moves LEFT.** This is a very safe move strategically if we assume Snake 0 is not suicidal or trying to move backward after eating an apple last turn (which resulted in length 2).\n\n**Evaluating DOWN to (6, 5):**\nThis moves me away from the immediate action zone around (7, 3) and (4, 7). Snake 0 seems likely to move towards (7, 3) (Apple) by moving RIGHT to (7, 3). If Snake 0 moves to (7, 3), I survive, but I missed an opportunity to possibly win immediately by causing self-destruction of the opponent.\n\n**Evaluating RIGHT to (7, 6):**\nThis moves me towards (7, 3), but less directly than moving DOWN and then LEFT/RIGHT maneuvers. If Snake 0 moves to (7, 3), we have a potential collision or proximity issue if Snake 0 successfully eats the apple.\n\n**Conclusion on Snake 0's LEFT move:**\nIf Snake 0 Head is at (6, 3) and Body is [(5, 3)], moving LEFT to (5, 3) causes Snake 0 to die due to self-collision. This makes LEFT the dominant strategic choice, assuming Snake 0 doesn't choose a different move. Since we must choose *our* move based on maximal advantage, capitalizing on the opponent's likely suicide move if they also try to move towards the center or away from my current line of sight seems powerful.\n\nIf I choose LEFT, I move to (5, 6). This positions me to potentially target (4, 7) next turn.\n\nLong Term Plan: Prioritize moves that maximize safe scoring potential, and secondarily, moves that exploit opponent weaknesses (like self-collision opportunities). Because moving LEFT forces Snake 0 into a highly likely self-kill (moving directly onto its existing body segment), I will choose LEFT. If Snake 0 chooses a different move (e.g., UP to (6, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 3)), I am safely positioned near (4, 7).\n\nMy snake post-move will be: Head (5, 6), Body [(6, 6), (6, 7)]. Length 3.\n\nStrategy Note: If Snake 0 does not move to (5, 3), the next target priority is the closest apple, likely (4, 7) or (7, 3). Moving to (5, 6) sets up a direct path to (4, 7) next turn (move UP).\n\nLEFT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 3 / 150. My head: (6, 6), Body: [(6, 7)]. Snake 0: Head (6, 3), Body [(5, 3)].\nMy UP move is fatal (hits body at (6, 7)).\nSafe moves: DOWN (6, 5), LEFT (5, 6), RIGHT (7, 6).\nSnake 0 moves from (6, 3). If Snake 0 plays LEFT, it moves to (5, 3), which is its current body segment, causing it to die. This provides the maximum strategic advantage.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) places me adjacent to apple (4, 7) for next turn, while exploiting the high probability of Snake 0 self-destructing.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n    *   How does Snake 0 react? If Snake 0 plays LEFT (6, 3) -> (5, 3), it dies. This is a strong incentive.\n    *   If Snake 0 avoids self-kill (5/6 chance), it likely moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT. If it moves UP to (7, 4), safe. If it moves RIGHT to (8, 3), safe.\n\n2.  **UP to (5, 7):** (1 step closer to (4, 7) diagonally, but maintains vertical alignment with two apples (4, 7) and (2, 7)).\n    *   If I move UP, new head is (5, 7). Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n    *   This sets up a direct LEFT move to (4, 7) next turn, allowing me to eat the apple if Snake 0 cooperates or moves away.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** (Moves away from closest apples). Not preferred unless necessary for safety.\n\n**Comparing LEFT (4, 6) vs UP (5, 7):**\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (4, 6)**:\nI am now adjacent to (4, 7). Next turn I can move UP to eat it, provided Snake 0 doesn't move into (4, 7) or block me by moving into (4, 6) (which is now my body!).\nSnake 0 is at (7, 3). If Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 4), I eat the apple next turn at (4, 7). If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (8, 3), I eat the apple next turn at (4, 7). If Snake 0 tries to move towards me (e.g., UP to (7, 4) then diagonals), it's slow.\n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 7)**:\nI can move LEFT next turn to (4, 7) and eat the apple.\nIf Snake 0 plays LEFT (dies), I eat (4, 7) next turn.\nIf Snake 0 plays UP (7, 4), I eat (4, 7) next turn.\nIf Snake 0 plays DOWN (7, 2), I eat (4, 7) next turn.\nIf Snake 0 plays RIGHT (8, 3), I eat (4, 7) next turn.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) seems to lock in eating (4, 7) on Turn 5, irrespective of Snake 0's safe moves (as long as Snake 0 doesn't block the path to (4, 7) by moving directly to (4, 7) itself, which is impossible from (7, 3)).\n\nLet's re-check Snake 0's potential blocking move: Snake 0 needs to get from (7, 3) to (4, 7). This takes at least 3 moves. If I move UP to (5, 7), I am safer than moving to (4, 6) because moving to (4, 6) places me adjacent to the apple, but moving to (5, 7) moves me *onto the same row* as the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 7). New body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\nSnake 0 moves from (7, 3). If it plays UP to (7, 4).\nNext turn (Turn 5): I move LEFT to (4, 7) and eat the apple. My new head is (4, 7), length 4. Snake 0 is at (7, 4). This seems highly optimal.\n\nLong Term Plan: Target apple (4, 7) immediately. If successful, Snake 1 will have 2 apples and length 4. Then re-evaluate targets (0, 8) and (2, 7) which are clustered near me.\n\nUP seems to offer the most straightforward path to the nearest apple.\n\n**Final Check:**\nCurrent: (5, 6). Forbidden: RIGHT (6, 6).\nUP to (5, 7). Safe. Sets up eating (4, 7) next turn.\n\nUP",

Wait, I need to look at the provided *current* state description to determine my current head position for *this* turn's decision.)\n\n**Reconciling Previous Rationale and Current State:**\nMy last rationale concluded I *should* move UP to (5, 7) on Turn 4.\nThe current state provided shows:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (5, 7), Body: [(5, 6)], Apples collected: 1.\nThis state description seems highly unusual or incorrect based on the previous turn's known state: Head (5, 6), Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7)]. If the move was UP to (5, 7) and I didn't eat an apple, the new body should be [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]. The provided state only shows one segment [(5, 6)] in the body, suggesting I either lost length or the provided state description reflects a state *before* any movement this turn, but *after* turn 4 resolution, or the body list is incomplete/represents a different previous state interpretation entirely.\n\nLet's rely strictly on the provided current board state for decision making at Turn 5, regardless of the discrepancy in the provided \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" description detail vs. what the rationale predicted happened on Turn 4:\n\n**Current Board State Analysis for Turn 5:**\nMy Head: (5, 7).\nMy Body: [(5, 6)]. (This implies my snake is currently length 2 before the move).\nBoard map location for 1: (5, 7) head, (5, 6) tail.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 Head: (8, 3), Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3)]. Length 3.\n\nApples: (4, 7), (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 2), (9, 8)\n\n**Safety Check (Self) from Head (5, 7):**\n1. **UP (5, 8):** Safe.\n2. **DOWN (5, 6):** Collision! (5, 6) is my body segment. **DEAD.**\n3. **LEFT (4, 7):** This is an Apple! Safe to move onto. If I move here, I eat the apple. New Head: (4, 7). New Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 3.\n4. **RIGHT (6, 7):** Safe.\n\nForbidden move: DOWN. Available moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple Hunting Strategy:**\nThe closest apple is (4, 7), which is directly to the LEFT. Moving LEFT results in eating this apple immediately.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (4, 7) (Eating Apple):**\n   *   New Head: (4, 7). New Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6)].\n   *   Next turn I will be right next to apple (2, 7) and very close to (0, 8).\n   *   How does Snake 0 move? Head at (8, 3), Body at [(7, 3), (6, 3)].\n      *   Snake 0's self-collision risk is moving to (7, 3) -> (6, 3) (LEFT).\n      *   If Snake 0 avoids LEFT, e.g., moves UP to (8, 4). No collision risk for me.\n\n2. **UP to (5, 8):** (Moves closer to (0, 8) and (9, 8)).\n   *   New Head: (5, 8). New Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 3.\n   *   This delays eating (4, 7). Snake 0 might move towards that area, or towards the other cluster.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6, 7):** (Moves away from current cluster).\n   *   New Head: (6, 7). New Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT immediately secures an apple, increases length, and places me ideally positioned to target the remaining apples in the upper left quadrant: (2, 7) and (0, 8). This is the superior greedy move, and it is safe.\n\nLong-Term Plan (If I eat the apple at (4, 7)): Snake 1 score becomes 2. Snake 1 length becomes 3. Head at (4, 7). Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6)].\nNext target cluster: (2, 7) and (0, 8). From (4, 7), moving LEFT/UP is efficient.\n\nLEFT",

Targets the vicinity of (2, 7) apple next.\n4. **RIGHT (5, 7):** Collision! (5, 7) is my immediate body segment. **DEAD.**\n\nForbidden move: RIGHT. Available safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake #0):**\nHead: (8, 2). Body: [(8, 3), (7, 3)].\nThe enemy is currently low and right. Its nearest apple is (9, 2) to its right, or (3, 4) further away.\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n* (8, 2) LEFT -> (7, 2): Seems safe.\n* (8, 2) UP -> (8, 3): Collision! Hits body segment (8, 3). **DEAD.**\n* (8, 2) DOWN -> (8, 1): Safe.\n* (8, 2) RIGHT -> (9, 2): Apple! Grows.\n\nSnake 0 is highly likely to move RIGHT to eat the apple at (9, 2), resulting in a new head at (9, 2). If it moves RIGHT, it will grow longer and move away from me. If it moves LEFT, it will approach my general area diagonally. If it moves DOWN, it moves away. Moving UP is suicidal for Snake 0. Given the presence of an apple right next to it, it is rational to assume Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 2).\n\n**My Strategy:**\nMy primary targets are the apple cluster at (0, 8) and (2, 7). My current head (4, 7) is well positioned to move towards (2, 7) by moving LEFT.\n\n1. **LEFT to (3, 7):**\n   * If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 2) (eating an apple, score 3).\n   * I approach (2, 7) apple. Next move aims at (2, 7).\n   * Head at (3, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 4. Looks good.\n\n2. **UP to (4, 8):**\n   * Moves me toward the (9, 8) or (0, 8) apples, but bypassing (2, 7) entirely for now. (2, 7) is only 2 steps away via (3, 7) then (2, 7), or 3 steps moving straight up then across.\n\n3. **DOWN to (4, 6):**\n   * Moves me towards the (3, 4) apple. (4, 6) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4). 3 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (2, 7) is currently the most geometrically accessible, requiring two moves (LEFT to (3, 7), then potentially LEFT or UP depending on positioning). Moving LEFT puts me in a better position to secure this apple next turn.\n\nI choose LEFT to advance toward the (2, 7) apple.\n\nShort-Term Plan: Secure the apple at (2, 7) on Turn 7, then assess path towards (0, 8). Snake 0 is likely occupied eating (9, 2).\n\nLEFT",

The \"Last Move Information\" section seems to be describing the state *after* a hypothetical move, or perhaps it has slightly lagged my interpretation of which move *just* occurred.\n\nLet's strictly use the provided Turn 7 board state:\nHead: (3, 7)\nBody: [(4, 7), (5, 7)] (Length 3, 2 apples)\nApples: (0, 8), (2, 7), (9, 8), (3, 4), (0, 6)\nSnake #0: Head: (9, 2), Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3)] (Length 4, 3 apples)\n*Wait, the provided snake structure in the current turn description seems to imply the snake *is* shorter than what the last move rationale suggested, and the head is at (3, 7).*\n\nIf the current state (Turn 7) is accurate:\nMy Head: (3, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7)]. (Length 3, 2 apples collected).\nThe immediate backwards move is (4, 7).\n\n**Possible Moves from (3, 7):**\n1. **UP (3, 8):** Safe. Towards (0, 8).\n2. **DOWN (3, 6):** Safe. Towards (3, 4).\n3. **LEFT (2, 7):** **Apple!** Captures apple at (2, 7). Grows to length 4.\n4. **RIGHT (4, 7):** Collision! Hits body segment (4, 7). **DEAD.**\n\nForbidden move: RIGHT.

(9, 2) is an apple location in the previous turn snapshot, but not in this turn's list (9, 2) is now occupied by the snake head.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head at (9, 2)):\n* UP (9, 3): Safe.\n* DOWN (9, 1): Safe.\n* LEFT (8, 2): Collision! Hits body segment (8, 2). **DEAD.**\n* RIGHT (10, 2): Off board. **DEAD.**\n\nSnake #0 is forced to move UP (9, 3) or DOWN (9, 1). It has no immediate apples to chase nearby. It is currently far from me (3, 7).\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 7) captures an apple immediately, increasing my score and length, and placing me between the remaining two apple clusters ((0, 8)/(0, 6) and (3, 4)). This is the strongest immediate gain.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 7):\nNew Head: (2, 7). New Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4. Score 3.\nSnake 0 will likely move to (9, 3) or (9, 1). We remain far apart and safe from collisions.\n\nThis seems like the optimal greedy move.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Capture (2, 7) now. Then aim for (0, 8) or (0, 6) via movement towards the left edge, or (3, 4) if the left path becomes obstructed. Since Snake 0 is far away, focusing on maximizing length and score is paramount.\n\nLEFT",

This confirms that the LEFT move chosen last turn was successful and collected the apple at (2, 7), increasing length to 4 (3 + 1).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 moved from (9, 2) last turn. Based on the rationale in the previous turn, the enemy was likely forced to move UP to (9, 3) or DOWN to (9, 1) as LEFT led to self-collision (8, 2). The provided state shows Snake #0 Head at (9, 3), Body [(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]. This confirms Snake #0 moved UP.\n\n**Current Position: Head (2, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4.**\nForbidden backwards move: (3, 7) is the immediate previous head position, but this is now the 1st body segment. Moving to (3, 7) is safe (it's the cell behind the head).\n\n**Possible Moves from (2, 7):**\n1. **UP (2, 8):** Safe. Targets (0, 8) or prepares path to (6, 7).\n2. **DOWN (2, 6):** Safe. Targets (0, 6).\n3. **LEFT (1, 7):** Safe. Moves towards left edge apples (0, 8), (0, 6).\n4. **RIGHT (3, 7):** **Safe.** Hits body segment (3, 7). Wait, no. (3, 7) is the cell *immediately* behind (2, 7). *Moving backwards is allowed in this specific setup if the board state reflects the growth correctly, IF the cell isn't your tail.* The standard rule is \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since (3, 7) is occupied by body segment 1, moving RIGHT to (3, 7) means moving into a body segment, which is fatal. **DEAD.**\n\nCheck Collision (RIGHT): Head (2, 7) -> Target (3, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Yes, (3, 7) is occupied. **RIGHT is fatal.**\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (9, 3)):**\nPossible moves for S0:\n* UP (9, 4): Safe.\n* DOWN (9, 2): Safe. Hits body segment (9, 2)? No, (9, 2) is the 2nd element. Moving to (9, 2) is lethal.\n* LEFT (8, 3): Hits body segment (8, 3). If S0 moves LEFT, S0 dies.\n* RIGHT (10, 3): Off board. S0 dies.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT or RIGHT, OR moves off board, S0 dies. S0 is highly constrained unless it moves UP or DOWN.\nIf S0 moves UP (9, 4): Safe.\nIf S0 moves DOWN (9, 2): Lethal (hits its own body segment (9, 2)).\n\nTherefore, Snake #0 is almost certainly forced to move **UP** to (9, 4), unless it choosesDOWN and dies, or LEFT/RIGHT and dies. S0 will likely move to (9, 4) and possibly target (9, 8) later, but that's very far.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am safe from S0. I have apples at (0, 8), (0, 6), (6, 7), (9, 8), (3, 4).\nMy position (2, 7) is very close to (0, 8) and (0, 6).\n\n1. **Move LEFT (1, 7):** Continues pressure towards the left wall apples (0, 8), (0, 6). Next turn can go to (0, 7) or (1, 8)/(1, 6). This sets up a strong sweep of the left side.\n2. **Move DOWN (2, 6):** Directly targets (0, 6). Safe.\n3. **Move UP (2, 8):** Heads towards (0, 8) or (9, 8). (0, 8) is closer, but DOWN/LEFT seem more direct routes to the nearest cluster.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 7), I set up a potential line along Y=7 or Y=6/8.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (2, 6), the body chain remains horizontal: (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7). The new body segment is (2, 6).\n\nIf I choose LEFT (1, 7), the new body segment is (1, 7).\n\nGoing towards the dense cluster of apples on the left edge (0, 8) and (0, 6) seems favorable. LEFT (1, 7) puts me one step closer horizontally to both.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Head towards the left edge apples ((0, 8) or (0, 6)). Prioritize the shortest path to one of these. Try to maintain a path that allows access to (3, 4) later if the left side clears out. Since S0 is isolated on the right, no need to hedge against it yet.\n\nChoosing LEFT to establish a strong presence on the left side cluster.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Snippet:**\nFocus on clearing the apples on the left side: (0, 8) and (0, 6). Move LEFT to (1, 7) this turn. If safe, next move targets (0, 7) or moves down to (1, 6) if (0, 6) is the priority.\n\nLEFT",

The previous state confirmed Head (2, 7) and Body [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)] *before* the LAST move (LEFT). If LEFT was a successful eat, the new body should be 4 segments long.

This also keeps my body stretched out horizontally along Y=7, which is generally safe unless S0 approaches the center.\n\nEnemy S0 is at (9, 4). It is nowhere near me. No immediate threat.\n\nI select LEFT to maximize control along the edge.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat (0, 8) or (0, 6) next turn using LEFT's positioning at (0, 7).

Moves towards apple A(0, 6).\n3. **LEFT (0, 7):** Safe. Moves to the edge, adjacent to apples A(0, 8) and A(0, 6).\n4. **RIGHT (2, 7):** **Fatal.** Hits my own body segment (2, 7).\n\n**Enemy Position Update:**\nSnake #0 is at (9, 5), body trailing down the right edge. It is far away. The immediate threat remains self-preservation and maximizing apple collection.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\nWe have a cluster of two apples on the left edge at Y=8 and Y=6, both X=0. My current X=1 position is ideal for targeting both.\n\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** Positions me on the wall. Next turn allows me to instantly move UP to (0, 8) (Eat A(0, 8)) or DOWN to (0, 6) (Eat A(0, 6)). This gives maximal flexibility for the next step while staying out of harm's way.\n*   **DOWN (1, 6):** Targets A(0, 6) next turn. If I move LEFT, I eat the apple. If I move UP (1, 7), I move backward one step along the line I just came from.\n*   **UP (1, 8):** Targets A(0, 8) next turn. If I move LEFT, I eat the apple. If I move DOWN (1, 7), I move backward one step.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) is marginally superior to moving directly towards one apple because it places me in a position where *both* adjacent apples become immediately reachable in one more step, and it keeps my overall alignment horizontal along Y=7/Y=6/Y=8, which is usually good for navigation. It also prevents the possibility of getting \"stuck\" if I move into a line leading away from the apples.\n\n**Strategy:** Move LEFT to (0, 7). On Turn 11, I will choose either UP or DOWN to collect one of the two corner apples, ensuring a guaranteed apple collection on the next turn, while keeping the other apple accessible if I reverse my Y direction immediately following the consumption.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Secure one of the two corner apples at X=0 immediately. Then pivot towards the center apple at (3, 4). Avoid conflict with S#0 on the right side.\n\nLEFT\n\n---\n*Self-Correction/Check on Backward Movement:*\nIf I choose LEFT to (0, 7), my previous body segments (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7) remain in place.\nNext turn targets:\n1. UP to (0, 8) -> Eats. New head (0, 8). New body: (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7). Safe.\n2. DOWN to (0, 6) -> Eats. New head (0, 6). New body: (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7). Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (1, 7) -> Moves onto (1, 7), which is the space where my head *was*. Since the body shifts, the segment at (2, 7) becomes the new segment 2, and (1, 7) becomes empty space unless I just ate. Since I didn't eat on Turn 10, RIGHT is safe (it moves to the empty cell just vacated by my head segment (1, 7) if it was full length before move, but the body list is shorter than expected based on score 3. Based on the state: Head (1, 7), Body [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]. If I move RIGHT to (2, 7), I hit my body. **Wait, my last move chose LEFT, so my body *before* the move was [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)] based on the provided state list (1, 7) Head.**\n*Revisiting the provided state for Turn 10:*\nHead: (1, 7). Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]. Length is 4 total cells. This is consistent with 3 apples eaten.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7), I hit body segment (2, 7). **RIGHT is still fatal.**\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7), this is safe.\n\nThe choice of LEFT remains the most strategically sound safe move.\n\nLEFT",
