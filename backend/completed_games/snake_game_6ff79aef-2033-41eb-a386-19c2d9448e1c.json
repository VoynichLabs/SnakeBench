          "rationale": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze the current game state:\n\nMy snake (ID 1):\n- Head at (3, 5)\n- No body segments yet\n- 0 apples collected\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head at (2, 4)\n- No body segments yet\n- 0 apples collected\n\nApples at: (7, 7), (6, 7), (7, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6)\n\nLet me consider each possible move:\n\n1. UP: (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 6)\n   - This is a valid move (within bounds)\n   - No snake body there\n   - Gets me closer to apple at (2, 6) which is at distance 2 (need to go left 1, up 1)\n   - Also moves toward the cluster of apples at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n2. DOWN: (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 4)\n   - This is a valid move (within bounds)\n   - No snake body there\n   - But moves away from most apples\n   - The enemy head is at (2, 4), so I wouldn't collide with their body\n\n3. LEFT: (3, 5) \u2192 (2, 5)\n   - This is a valid move (within bounds)\n   - No snake body there\n   - Gets me closer to apple at (2, 6) - just one step up after this\n   - Also closer to apple at (1, 9)\n\n4. RIGHT: (3, 5) \u2192 (4, 5)\n   - This is a valid move (within bounds)\n   - No snake body there\n   - Moves toward the cluster of apples at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake's likely moves:\n- Enemy is at (2, 4)\n- The closest apple to them is (2, 6), which requires going UP twice\n- They might also consider (1, 9) but that's farther\n\nIf enemy moves UP: (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5)\nIf I move LEFT: (3, 5) \u2192 (2, 5) - HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die!\n\nSo I should avoid moving LEFT if there's a chance the enemy goes UP.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- If I go UP to (3, 6), I'm safe and can then go LEFT to (2, 6) to get the apple\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 5), I move toward the cluster of apples\n\nThe enemy is likely to go UP toward the apple at (2, 6). If they go UP, they'll be at (2, 5).\n\nIf I go UP (to 3, 6), next turn I could:\n- Go LEFT to (2, 6) and get the apple\n- But wait, if enemy goes UP twice, they'd be at (2, 6) on turn 2\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully:\n- Turn 0: I'm at (3, 5), enemy at (2, 4)\n- If I go UP: (3, 6)\n- If enemy goes UP: (2, 5)\n\n- Turn 1: I'm at (3, 6), enemy at (2, 5)\n- If I go LEFT: (2, 6) - I get the apple!\n- If enemy goes UP: (2, 6) - HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n\nSo there's a risk of collision at (2, 6) if we both go for it. But I have a slightly longer path (I need to go UP then LEFT), while enemy needs to go UP twice.\n\nActually, let me recalculate distances:\n- From (3, 5) to (2, 6): Manhattan distance = |3-2| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- From (2, 4) to (2, 6): Manhattan distance = |2-2| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSame distance! So it's a race for the apple at (2, 6).\n\nLet me think about the safer play:\n- Going RIGHT (4, 5) keeps me moving toward the cluster of 3 apples at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n- This avoids potential conflicts with the enemy who might go for (2, 6) or (1, 9)\n\nLet me calculate distances to the apple cluster:\n- From (3, 5) to (6, 7): |3-6| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From (3, 5) to (7, 7): |3-7| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- From (3, 5) to (7, 8): |3-7| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nFrom enemy (2, 4):\n- To (6, 7): |2-6| + |4-7| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- To (7, 7): |2-7| + |4-7| = 5 + 3 = 8\n- To (7, 8): |2-7| + |4-8| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nI'm closer to the apple cluster! If I go for that, I can potentially collect multiple apples before the enemy reaches them.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Go UP to (3, 6) - this moves me toward both (2, 6) and the cluster\n2. Then I can decide: go LEFT to compete for (2, 6) or go RIGHT toward the cluster\n\nActually, thinking more carefully:\n- If I go UP now to (3, 6), I'm adjacent to (2, 6) next turn\n- Enemy going UP puts them at (2, 5), still 1 away from (2, 6)\n- So I'd reach (2, 6) first if I go UP then LEFT!\n\nBut wait, enemy could also go UP. Let me think about collision risk:\n\nTurn 0:\n- I go UP: (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 6)\n- Enemy goes UP: (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5)\n- No collision\n\nTurn 1:\n- I go LEFT: (3, 6) \u2192 (2, 6) - get apple!\n- Enemy goes UP: (2, 5) \u2192 (2, 6) - HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n\nSo if we both beeline for (2, 6), we collide there on turn 1. That's risky.\n\nAlternative: Go RIGHT toward the cluster\n- Turn 0: (3, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) with RIGHT\n- Then continue toward (6, 7) or (7, 7)\n\nThis seems safer and I can collect multiple apples without immediate competition.\n\nLet me also consider: what if I go UP (to 3, 6) and then RIGHT (to 4, 6)?\n- Turn 0: (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 6) with UP\n- Turn 1: (3, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) with RIGHT\n- Continue toward the cluster\n\nThis gives me flexibility and avoids the collision at (2, 6).\n\nI think going UP is a good first move:\n1. It's safe (no collision risk this turn)\n2. It keeps options open - I can go for (2, 6) if enemy doesn't, or pivot to the cluster\n3. It moves me generally toward multiple apples\n\nActually, let me reconsider the risk of going LEFT on turn 0:\n- If I go LEFT: (3, 5) \u2192 (2, 5)\n- If enemy goes UP: (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5)\n- HEAD-ON COLLISION on turn 0!\n\nSo LEFT is risky! I should avoid it.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nBest move considering apple proximity and strategic position:\n- UP moves toward apples and keeps options open\n- RIGHT moves toward the apple cluster\n- DOWN moves away from apples\n\nI'll go with UP. It's a balanced move that keeps my options open and doesn't risk a head-on collision this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After going UP, assess where the enemy is heading. If they go for (2, 6), pivot toward the apple cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8). If they go elsewhere, consider grabbing (2, 6) first then heading to the cluster.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the board, I need to analyze my options carefully.\n\n**Current position:** (3, 5)\n**Enemy position:** (2, 4)\n\n**Analyzing each direction:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (3, 6):** Safe, moves toward apples at (2, 6) and the cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (3, 4):** Safe, but moves away from all apples - not strategic\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (2, 5):** DANGEROUS! Enemy at (2, 4) is likely to move UP toward the apple at (2, 6). If enemy goes UP, they'd move to (2, 5) - same cell as me. This risks a head-on collision!\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5):** Safe, moves toward the apple cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n**Apple distance analysis:**\n- Apple at (2, 6): I'm 2 moves away, enemy is also 2 moves away - contested!\n- Apple cluster (6,7), (7,7), (7,8): I'm 5-7 moves away, enemy is 7-9 moves away - I have advantage\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\nGoing UP to (3, 6) is optimal because:\n- It's completely safe this turn\n- Puts me adjacent to the apple at (2, 6) \n- Keeps me flexible - I can either compete for (2, 6) or pivot right toward the larger cluster\n- If enemy commits to going UP twice for (2, 6), I can assess and potentially avoid a collision by going RIGHT instead\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After going UP, observe enemy movement. If they're heading to (2, 6), pivot RIGHT toward the apple cluster where I have the distance advantage. If they go elsewhere, grab (2, 6) then head to the cluster.\n\nUP",

Let me check each possible move:\n\n1. UP: (3, 6) \u2192 (3, 7)\n   - Within bounds\n   - No snake body there\n   - No apple there\n   - Moves toward the cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\n2.

RIGHT: (3, 6) \u2192 (4, 6)\n   - Within bounds\n   - No snake body there\n   - Moves toward the cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake:\n- Enemy is at (1, 4)\n- Last turn they were at (2, 4), so they moved LEFT (or this is wrong... wait, looking at the current state)\n\nActually, looking at the board state again:\n- Last turn enemy was at (2, 4)\n- Now enemy is at (1, 4)\n- So enemy moved LEFT\n\nEnemy's closest apples:\n- (2, 6): distance = |1-2| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (1, 9): distance = |1-1| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nMy distance to (2, 6): |3-2| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1! I'm right next to it!\n\nIf I go LEFT, I get the apple at (2, 6) this turn!\n\nLet me check if there's any collision risk:\n- Enemy at (1, 4) moving toward (2, 6) would need to go RIGHT then UP UP\n- If enemy goes RIGHT: (1, 4) \u2192 (2, 4)\n- If enemy goes UP: (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 5)\n\nNeither of these would put the enemy at (2, 6) this turn. So I can safely grab the apple!\n\nWait, let me double-check collision risk at (2, 6):\n- My move to (2, 6) with LEFT\n- Enemy is at (1, 4), so even if they moved UP twice and RIGHT once (UP UP RIGHT = (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (2,6)), that would take 3 turns\n- But this turn, enemy can only make one move\n\nEnemy's possible positions after this turn:\n- UP: (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 5)\n- DOWN: (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 3)\n- LEFT: (1, 4) \u2192 (0, 4)\n- RIGHT: (1, 4) \u2192 (2, 4)\n\nNone of these are (2, 6), so no head-on collision risk!\n\nI should definitely go LEFT to grab the apple at (2, 6)!\n\nAfter getting this apple, my plan should be:\n1. Turn 1: Go LEFT to (2, 6), get apple\n2. Then head toward the cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n   - From (2, 6), I'd need to go RIGHT and UP\n   - Go RIGHT to (3, 6), then (4, 6), then (5, 6), then (6, 6)\n   - Then UP to (6, 7) for another apple!\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. After eating the apple at (2, 6), I'll have a body segment. Let me plan the path more carefully.\n\nAfter turn 1: Head at (2, 6), body at (3, 6)\n\nThen I need to avoid going RIGHT immediately (that would be backwards into my body at (3, 6)).\n\nFrom (2, 6), safe moves would be:\n- UP: (2, 7) - safe\n- DOWN: (2, 5) - safe\n- LEFT: (1, 6) - safe\n\nSo after eating the apple, I should go UP to (2, 7), then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to reach (6, 7) for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for the apple at (1, 9) which is UP, UP, UP, LEFT from (2, 6).\n\nLet me think about optimal path:\n- From (2, 6), going UP puts me at (2, 7)\n- Then I could go UP to (2, 8), UP to (2, 9), LEFT to (1, 9) - get apple!\n- Or from (2, 7), go RIGHT to (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7) - get apple!\n\nThe cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8) has 3 apples close together, so that's probably more efficient.\n\nAlright, my decision is clear: go LEFT to (2, 6) and eat the apple!\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Turn 1: LEFT to (2, 6) - eat apple\n- Turn 2: UP to (2, 7) - can't go RIGHT (body at 3,6 but wait, I'll have body at old head position)\n\nActually let me recalculate. When I eat an apple:\n- My head moves to (2, 6)\n- My tail doesn't move (I grow)\n- But I have no body yet, so I just become head at (2, 6) with no body? No wait...\n\nWhen a snake with just a head eats an apple:\n- Head moves to apple location\n- Snake grows by 1, so now I have a head and a body segment\n- The body segment would be at my old head position (3, 6)\n\nSo after eating:\n- Head at (2, 6)\n- Body at (3, 6)\n\nFrom (2, 6), I cannot go RIGHT to (3, 6) because that's my body.\nValid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\nThen my plan:\n- Turn 2: UP to (2, 7)\n- Turn 3: RIGHT to (3, 7) - my body would be at (2, 6), (3, 6)... wait no\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. After eating an apple, my body grows. Each turn:\n- Head moves in chosen direction\n- Body segments follow the head (each segment moves to where the segment in front of it was)\n- If I ate an apple, I don't lose the tail segment (I grow by 1)\n\nTurn 1: Head (3,6), no body\n- Move LEFT to (2,6), eat apple\n- After turn 1: Head (2,6), body (3,6) [I grew because I ate]\n\nTurn 2: Head (2,6), body (3,6)\n- Move UP to (2,7)\n- After turn 2: Head (2,7), body (2,6) [body moved to old head position, no apple so tail disappears]\n\nTurn 3: Head (2,7), body (2,6)\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n- After turn 3: Head (3,7), body (2,7) [body follows head]\n\nThis makes sense! So after eating the apple, I go UP, then I can go RIGHT safely.\n\nPlan:\n- Turn 1: LEFT (eat apple at 2,6)\n- Turn 2: UP (to 2,7)\n- Turn 3+: Head toward (6,7), (7,7), (7,8) cluster\n\nDecision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current game state:\n\n**My position:** (3, 6)\n**Enemy position:** (1, 4) - they moved LEFT from (2, 4) last turn\n\n**Analyzing each direction:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (3, 7):** Safe, moves toward apple cluster\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (3, 5):** Safe, but moves away from apples\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (2, 6):** Safe, AND there's an apple there! I can eat it immediately!\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6):** Safe, moves toward apple cluster\n\n**Collision risk check for (2, 6):**\nEnemy is at (1, 4). Their possible moves this turn:\n- UP: (1, 5)\n- DOWN: (1, 3)\n- LEFT: (0, 4)\n- RIGHT: (2, 4)\n\nNone of these reach (2, 6), so NO head-on collision risk!\n\n**Strategic assessment:**\nI'm directly adjacent to an apple at (2, 6). I should absolutely grab it! The enemy is 3 moves away from this apple, so I have a clear advantage.\n\n**Long-term plan after eating:**\n- Turn 1: LEFT to (2, 6) - eat apple (body will be at 3,6)\n- Turn 2: UP to (2, 7) - can't go RIGHT due to body\n- Turn 3+: Navigate RIGHT toward the apple cluster at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8)\n\nThis gives me an early lead and positions me well to collect the cluster of 3 apples, where I have a distance advantage over the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

Nearest apples to enemy:\n- (5, 5): distance = |1-5| + |5-5| = 4\n- (1, 9): distance = |1-1| + |5-9| = 4\n- (6, 7): distance = |1-6| + |5-7| = 7\n- (7, 7): distance = |1-7| + |5-7| = 8\n- (7, 8): distance = |1-7| + |5-8| = 9\n\nThe enemy's two closest apples are (5, 5) and (1, 9), both at distance 4.\n\nFor (5, 5), enemy would move RIGHT.\nFor (1, 9), enemy would move UP.\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT: (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 5) - this collides with my DOWN move\nIf enemy goes UP: (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 6) - this collides with my LEFT move\n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT have collision risks!\n\nLet me think more strategically:\n- If I go UP to (2, 7), I'm safe regardless of what the enemy does\n- If I go DOWN to (2, 5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 5), we both die (head-on collision)\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 6) and enemy goes UP to (1, 6), we both die (head-on collision)\n\nWhat's the probability the enemy goes each direction?\n- (5, 5) is a good target for enemy (apple at distance 4, moving RIGHT)\n- (1, 9) is also good (apple at distance 4, moving UP)\n\nBoth apples are equidistant. If the enemy is smart, they might go for (5, 5) since it's in a more open area, or they might go UP toward (1, 9).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The enemy could also be trying to block me or chase me. But most likely they're going for apples.\n\nGiven the risk, UP seems like the safest choice because:\n1. It doesn't risk a head-on collision with the enemy\n2. It moves me toward the cluster of apples at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n3. It keeps me away from the enemy\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 7):\n- My body will be at (2, 6) next turn\n- From (2, 7), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (not DOWN into my body)\n- I can continue toward the apple cluster\n\nLet me plan my path to apples:\nFrom (2, 7):\n- To (6, 7): RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT (4 moves)\n- To (1, 9): LEFT, UP, UP (3 moves)\n\nActually (1, 9) is closer! And I'd get there before the enemy if they go for (5, 5).\n\nBut wait, if enemy goes UP (toward 1, 9), they'd be at:\n- Turn 2: (1, 6)\n- Turn 3: (1, 7)\n- Turn 4: (1, 8)\n- Turn 5: (1, 9)\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 7) this turn, then LEFT to (1, 7) next turn... wait, let me be careful here.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully:\n\nAfter this turn (if I go UP):\n- My head: (2, 7)\n- My body: (2, 6)\n\nNext turn options from (2, 7):\n- UP to (2, 8)\n- LEFT to (1, 7) - need to check if enemy could be there\n- RIGHT to (3, 7)\n\nIf enemy went UP this turn to (1, 6), next turn they could be at (1, 7) if they go UP again.\n\nSo going LEFT to (1, 7) next turn could be risky if enemy is also heading toward (1, 9).\n\nI think the safer long-term strategy is:\n- This turn: UP to (2, 7)\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (3, 7) or UP to (2, 8)\n- Continue toward the cluster at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n\nThis avoids potential collision with the enemy who might be heading toward (1, 9).\n\nActually, let me reconsider the apple at (5, 5). \n\nFrom (2, 7), to get to (5, 5):\n- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN = 5 moves\n\nFrom enemy at (1, 5), to get to (5, 5):\n- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT = 4 moves\n\nEnemy is closer to (5, 5).\n\nFrom (2, 7), to get to (6, 7):\n- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT = 4 moves\n\nFrom enemy at (1, 5), to get to (6, 7):\n- UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT = 7 moves (or similar)\n\nI'm much closer to (6, 7)!\n\nSo my plan should be:\n1. Go UP to (2, 7) - safe, avoids collision\n2. Head RIGHT toward the cluster (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n3. Collect multiple apples in that area\n\nDecision: UP\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 2 (now): UP to (2, 7) - safe move\n- Turn 3: RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- Turn 4: RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nThis gets me 3 more apples quickly while staying safe from the enemy.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\n**My position:** Head at (2, 6), body at (3, 6)\n**Enemy position:** Head at (1, 5), no body\n\n**Analyzing each direction:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (2, 7):** Safe, within bounds, no collision risk\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (2, 5):** RISKY - Enemy at (1, 5) could move RIGHT to (2, 5), causing head-on collision\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (1, 6):** RISKY - Enemy at (1, 5) could move UP to (1, 6), causing head-on collision\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6):** DEATH - my body is there!\n\n**Enemy's likely targets:**\n- (5, 5) at distance 4 \u2192 would move RIGHT\n- (1, 9) at distance 4 \u2192 would move UP\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT put me at risk of head-on collision depending on enemy's choice!\n\n**Strategic assessment:**\nUP is the only guaranteed safe move. It also:\n- Moves me toward the apple cluster at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n- I have a distance advantage to this cluster vs the enemy\n- Keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 2: UP to (2, 7) \u2713\n- Turn 3-6: HEAD RIGHT toward (6, 7)\n- Then collect apples at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8) - three apples in close proximity!\n\nThe enemy will likely go for (5, 5) or (1, 9). Either way, I can secure the cluster of three apples with my current path advantage.\n\nUP",

Nearest apples to enemy:\n- (5, 5): distance = |1-5| + |4-5| = 5\n- (1, 9): distance = |1-1| + |4-9| = 5\n- (6, 7): distance = |1-6| + |4-7| = 8\n- (7, 7): distance = |1-7| + |4-7| = 9\n- (7, 8): distance = |1-7| + |4-8| = 10\n\nEnemy's closest apples are (5, 5) and (1, 9), both at distance 5.\n\nFor (5, 5), enemy at (1, 4) would move RIGHT to (2, 4) or UP to (1, 5).\nFor (1, 9), enemy would move UP to (1, 5).\n\nThe enemy can't reach my current position (2, 7) in one move - they're at (1, 4).\n\nLet me check for potential head-on collision risks:\n- If I go UP to (2, 8): Enemy can't reach (2, 8) in one move from (1, 4)\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 7): Enemy can't reach (1, 7) in one move from (1, 4)\n- If I go RIGHT to (3, 7): Enemy can't reach (3, 7) in one move from (1, 4)\n\nAll three remaining moves are safe from head-on collision this turn!\n\nNow let me think strategically about which apple to target:\n\nOption A: Go LEFT toward (1, 9)\n- LEFT to (1, 7)\n- UP to (1, 8)\n- UP to (1, 9) - eat apple!\n- 3 moves to get 1 apple\n\nBut if enemy also goes for (1, 9):\n- Enemy at (1, 4) needs: UP, UP, UP, UP, UP = 5 moves to reach (1, 9)\n- I'd get there in 3 moves, so I'd beat the enemy\n\nOption B: Go RIGHT toward cluster (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n- RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n- 6 moves to get 3 apples\n\nOption C: Go UP toward (7, 8)\n- UP to (2, 8)\n- Then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to (7, 8) - eat apple\n- Then DOWN to (7, 7) - eat apple\n- Then LEFT to (6, 7) - eat apple\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at my last rationale, my plan was:\n- Turn 2: UP to (2, 7) \u2713 (done)\n- Turn 3: RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- Continue toward cluster\n\nHowever, let me also consider (1, 9). From (2, 7):\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 7), then UP to (1, 8), then UP to (1, 9) - 3 moves for 1 apple\n- Then I'd be at the top edge and might need to come back down\n\nGoing RIGHT toward the cluster seems better for multiple apples:\n- RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- RIGHT to (6, 7) - apple!\n- RIGHT to (7, 7) - apple!\n- UP to (7, 8) - apple!\n\nThat's 3 apples in 6 moves in a nice cluster.\n\nBut wait, (5, 5) is also an option. From (2, 7):\n- If I go down... wait, DOWN is blocked by my body.\n\nActually, let me reconsider UP:\n- UP to (2, 8)\n- From (2, 8), I could go:\n  - LEFT to (1, 8), then UP to (1, 9) - apple in 3 total moves\n  - RIGHT toward the cluster\n\nGoing UP keeps both options open!\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 7):\n- My body will be at (2, 7)\n- From (3, 7), I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (not LEFT into body)\n- I'm still heading toward the cluster\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 8):\n- My body will be at (2, 7)\n- From (2, 8), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (not DOWN into body)\n- I could pivot to (1, 9) or continue toward cluster\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 7):\n- My body will be at (2, 7)\n- From (1, 7), I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (not RIGHT into body)\n- Wait, LEFT from (1, 7) would be (0, 7) - that's valid\n- I'm committed to the (1, 9) path\n\nLet me think about efficiency:\n- (1, 9): 3 moves for 1 apple = 0.33 apples/move\n- Cluster (6,7), (7,7), (7,8): 6 moves for 3 apples = 0.5 apples/move\n\nThe cluster is more efficient!\n\nAlso, going toward the cluster gives me more space to maneuver and keeps me away from the enemy who might go for (1, 9) or (5, 5).\n\nI think RIGHT is the best move to continue toward the cluster.\n\nLet me verify my path is clear:\n- RIGHT to (3, 7) - clear\n- From (3, 7), my body at (2, 7)\n- RIGHT to (4, 7) - clear\n- From (4, 7), body at (3, 7)\n- RIGHT to (5, 7) - clear\n- From (5, 7), body at (4, 7)\n- RIGHT to (6, 7) - APPLE! \n\nThis plan looks solid. Going RIGHT.\n\n**Updated long-term plan:**\n- Turn 3 (now): RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- Turn 4: RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nThis gets me from 1 apple to 4 apples, significantly ahead of the enemy who has 0.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\n**My position:** Head at (2, 7), body at (2, 6)\n**Enemy position:** Head at (1, 4), no body\n\n**Analyzing each direction:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (2, 8):** Safe, within bounds\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (2, 6):** DEATH - my body is there!\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (1, 7):** Safe, toward apple at (1, 9)\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7):** Safe, toward apple cluster at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)\n\nDOWN is eliminated (moving into my own body).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (1, 4) is far enough away that no head-on collision is possible this turn. Their closest apples are (5, 5) and (1, 9), both at distance 5.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nFollowing my previous plan, I should head toward the cluster of 3 apples at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8). This is more efficient than going for the single apple at (1, 9):\n- Cluster: 6 moves for 3 apples = 0.5 apples/move\n- (1, 9): 3 moves for 1 apple = 0.33 apples/move\n\nGoing RIGHT keeps me on track to collect multiple apples while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 3 (now): RIGHT to (3, 7)\n- Turn 4: RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nThis secures 3 apples in quick succession while the enemy is far behind.\n\nRIGHT",

Let me check nearest apples to enemy:\n- (5, 5): distance = |1-5| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (1, 9): distance = |1-1| + |3-9| = 0 + 6 = 6\n- (6, 7): distance = |1-6| + |3-7| = 5 + 4 = 9\n- (7, 7): distance = |1-7| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10\n- (7, 8): distance = |1-7| + |3-8| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\nEnemy's closest apples are (5, 5) and (1, 9), both at distance 6.\n\nLet me check for potential head-on collision risks:\nEnemy at (1, 3) can move to:\n- UP: (1, 4)\n- DOWN: (1, 2)\n- LEFT: (0, 3)\n- RIGHT: (2, 3)\n\nNone of these are close to where I could move:\n- (3, 8) - UP\n- (3, 6) - DOWN\n- (4, 7) - RIGHT\n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn!\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn, I should continue RIGHT toward the apple cluster.\n\nMy current plan was:\n- Turn 3: RIGHT to (3, 7) \u2713 (done)\n- Turn 4 (now): RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nThis is still a solid plan. Let me verify:\n- RIGHT to (4, 7) - clear \u2713\n- Then body will be at (3, 7)\n- From (4, 7), I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (not LEFT into body)\n\nThe cluster path is still the most efficient:\n- 3 more moves to reach (6, 7) for first apple\n- Then 1 more move to (7, 7) for second apple\n- Then 1 more move UP to (7, 8) for third apple\n\nLet me also consider alternative paths:\n\n**Option UP \u2192 (3, 8):**\n- From (3, 8), I could go toward (7, 8) directly\n- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to (7, 8) - 5 moves total for 1 apple\n- Then DOWN to (7, 7) - apple\n- Then LEFT to (6, 7) - apple\n- Total: 7 moves for 3 apples\n\n**Option RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7):**\n- RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- RIGHT to (6, 7) - apple!\n- RIGHT to (7, 7) - apple!\n- UP to (7, 8) - apple!\n- Total: 5 moves for 3 apples\n\n**Option DOWN \u2192 (3, 6):**\n- This takes me away from the cluster\n- Could potentially go for (5, 5)\n- DOWN to (3, 6), RIGHT to (4, 6), RIGHT to (5, 6), UP to (5, 5) - 4 moves for 1 apple\n- Not as efficient\n\nRIGHT is clearly the best move - it's the most direct path to the apple cluster and the most efficient.\n\nLet me double-check for any traps:\n- Going RIGHT to (4, 7), then continuing RIGHT...\n- I'll have plenty of space to maneuver\n- The right side of the board is relatively open\n- No immediate wall or snake body traps\n\nI'll continue with RIGHT.\n\n**Updated long-term plan:**\n- Turn 4 (now): RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nAfter collecting these 3 apples, I'll have 4 total vs enemy's likely 0-1. Then I can reassess and potentially go for (5, 5) or (1, 9) depending on where the enemy is.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\n**My position:** Head at (3, 7), body at (2, 7)\n**Enemy position:** Head at (1, 3), no body\n\n**Analyzing each direction:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (3, 8):** Safe, within bounds\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (3, 6):** Safe, within bounds\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (2, 7):** DEATH - my body is there!\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7):** Safe, continues toward apple cluster\n\nLEFT is eliminated (moving into my own body).\n\n**Enemy collision check:**\nEnemy at (1, 3) can move to (1, 4), (1, 2), (0, 3), or (2, 3). None of these positions overlap with my possible moves, so no head-on collision risk.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nContinuing my planned path toward the apple cluster at (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8) is the most efficient strategy:\n- RIGHT path: 5 moves for 3 apples\n- UP path to same cluster: 7 moves for 3 apples\n- DOWN toward (5, 5): 4 moves for 1 apple (less efficient)\n\nThe enemy is far away at (1, 3) and will likely go for (5, 5) or (1, 9), neither of which interferes with my cluster plan.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Turn 4 (now): RIGHT to (4, 7)\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat apple!\n- Turn 8: UP to (7, 8) - eat apple!\n\nThis secures 3 apples in quick succession, putting me at 4 apples vs the enemy's 0.\n\nRIGHT",
