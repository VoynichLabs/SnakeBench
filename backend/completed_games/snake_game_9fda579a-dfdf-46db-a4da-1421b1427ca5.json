Our rival is at (6,0) - they're way down at the bottom while we're up top. \n\nLet me check our safe moves:\n- **UP** to (4,9): That's the top edge! We'd be at y=9, which is the max. Still safe for now though!\n- **DOWN** to (4,7): Clear path, no issues!\n- **LEFT** to (3,8): Also clear!\n- **RIGHT** to (5,8): Wait... there's an apple at (6,8)? No, looking at the board again - (5,8) is just empty space. Safe!\n\nAll four directions are technically safe right now since neither snake has a body yet. But we need to think strategically!\n\nThe apples are scattered all over, but I notice a cluster down at y=2 with several apples. However, our rival is starting at the bottom - if we both go for those, we might end up in a collision course!\n\nLet me think about positioning... We're at the top half, they're at the bottom. If we go **UP** to (4,9), we claim the top edge and can work our way down strategically. This gives us control of the upper territory and forces them to come up to us if they want that action.\n\nPlus, going **UP** keeps our options open - from (4,9) we can still go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT on future turns. It's a strong opening move that establishes board presence without immediately committing to any apple path.\n\n**UP**",

All are safe this turn (no immediate collision).\n- APPLE CONSIDERATION: There is an apple at (6,1). Hitting it now gives us +1 apple and a new length without risking the head-on with the opponent.\n\nWhy UP makes the most sense now:\n- Immediate reward: eat an apple right away, growing our length and scoring early.\n- Positioning: moving up from the bottom edge keeps us in the center-left area with multiple escape routes next turn.\n- Enemy distance: opponent is far away at (4,8); there\u2019s no imminent collision risk this turn, so we should optimize for growth and future mobility.\n\nLong-term vibe:\n- Use the extra length to threaten in open space, pressure the board, and force awkward moves from the rival.\n- If we stack apples in reach, we can create branching paths and keep options open instead of getting pinched.\n\nTurn 0 move:\nUP",
