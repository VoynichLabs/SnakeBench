The body is a straight line joining all segments. The body has a fixed length, increasing only when the snake eats an apple, and decreasing when it dies.\n\nSnakes move by growing a new segment in the direction it's moving. Snakes can change direction by 90 degrees at any time.\n\nSnakes die by colliding with another snake or its own body.\n\nWhen two or more snakes occupy the same space, they both die.\n\nSnakes are born when a tail segment splits. The split can only happen at the tail segment, and the new segment becomes a new snake's head.\n\nSplitting happens when a snake moves onto an apple. The tail segment of the snake splits in two, and the original segment becomes the head of a new snake.\n\nThe new snake grows a new segment when it eats an apple, like normal. However, the new snake cannot split further. It's a one-time event that only happens when it moves onto an apple.\n\nThe new snake moves independently from the original snake, but they share the same set of movement rules and are subject to the same conditions.\n\nWhen a snake dies, all its segments remain on the grid indefinitely, as a dead remnant.
