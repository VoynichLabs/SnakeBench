Since the enemy snake is below me, moving upwards seems like the safest option for now. This will also bring me closer to the apple at (8, 8).\n\nFor future turns, I should keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and try to predict its path. If it moves towards the apple at (8, 8), I might need to change my strategy and target a different apple instead. It's important to remain flexible and adapt to the changing situation on the board.\n\nNext move: UP"

However, the enemy snake has also moved up and is now at (9, 5), which is directly to my left.\n\nI should continue moving towards the apple at (8, 8) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. If I move up again, I'll be at (9, 5), which would put me right next to the enemy snake. That could be risky, as the enemy snake might try to block my path or even kill me if I'm not careful.\n\nInstead, I think the best move is to go left towards (8, 4). This will bring me closer to the apple at (8, 8) while also avoiding the enemy snake. It will also give me more options for future moves, as I can either continue left or move up depending on the enemy snake's actions.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and be ready to adjust my path if necessary. If the enemy snake moves towards the apple at (8, 8), I might need to prioritize a different apple or find a way to safely navigate around the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
