Let's break down the board state and plot our next move to keep dominating Snake #0.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8)], Apples: 1\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (2, 6), Body: none, Apples: 0\n- We're ahead 1-0 - this is CRUCIAL! We can afford to be AGGRESSIVE and force collisions if needed.\n- Board is 10x10 with apples scattered. Our apple count: 1, Enemy: 0\n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS FROM (6, 8):**\n\n**UP** to (6, 9):\n- \u2705 On board (y=9 is max)\n- \u2705 No self body (my body is at (5,8), not (6,9))\n- \u2705 No enemy body at (6, 9) - enemy is at (2,6) with no body\n- \u2705 Apple at (5, 9) - wait, no apple at (6,9). Apple at (5,9) is to my LEFT-UP\n- \ud83d\udcca Path: Moves me to top-right corner, very safe. From here I could go LEFT to (5,9) next turn for that apple.\n\n**DOWN** to (6, 7):\n- \u2705 On board\n- \u2705 Safe from bodies\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Enemy at (2,6) - far away, no immediate threat\n- \ud83d\udcca Path: Moves toward center, opens options to go LEFT or RIGHT from there.\n\n**LEFT** to (5, 8):\n- \u274c WAIT! That's my own body segment! My body is at (5,8). If I move LEFT, I'd be moving into my own body. That's suicide. DEAD. ELIMINATE!\n\n**RIGHT** to (7, 8):\n- \u2705 On board\n- \u2705 Safe from bodies (my body is at (5,8), enemy at (2,6))\n- \u26a0\ufe0f No apple here (apple at (7,4), (7,0), (7,9) - none at (7,8))\n- \ud83d\udcca Path: Moves me further right, away from enemy. From (7,8) I have options: UP to (7,9) for apple, DOWN to (7,7), LEFT back to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nWe're LEADING 1-0! Now it's about EXPANSION and BOARD CONTROL. Snake #0 is on the LEFT side (x=2), we're on the RIGHT side (x=6). We want to STAY on the RIGHT and start boxing him in.\n\nLooking at apple locations: (5,9) is above me, (7,9) is right-up, (6,2) is down-left, etc. \n\n**BEST MOVE: UP to (6,9)**\n\nWhy UP?\n1. **POSITIONING**: Moves to top-right corner (6,9). This is a STRONG position - corner gives us fewer directions but it's SAFE and we control the top-right quadrant.\n2. **NEXT TURN OPTIONS**: From (6,9), I can go:\n   - LEFT to (5,9) - there's an APPLE at (5,9)! \n   - DOWN to (6,8) - back to current position\n   - RIGHT to (7,9) - there's an APPLE at (7,9) as well!\n   - Can't go UP (edge)\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: By moving to top-right corner, we're claiming that territory. Snake #0 is stuck on the left side. We can start shrinking his space.\n4. **SAFETY**: Absolutely no collision threats. Enemy is far away with no body.\n5. **AGGRESSION**: We're ahead! We can afford to claim high ground and force Snake #0 into a corner later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the top-right corner first, then eat the apples at (5,9) and (7,9) to grow. Use our growing body to block off the right side of the board. Force Snake #0 into the left side and make them crash into walls or our body. We're 1-0, time to RAMPAGE!\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

Apple is RIGHT THERE.\n- **RIGHT (7,9)**: Further right, still safe, apple also RIGHT THERE.\n\n**BEST MOVE: LEFT to (5,9)** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWhy?\n1. **IMMEDIATE POINT**: Apple at (5,9) = +1 score = 2-0 LEAD! We grow and dominate!\n2. **POSITIONING**: (5,9) is better central position than (7,9) - more options to attack snake #0 later.\n3. **BOARD CONTROL**: From (5,9), I can move DOWN to (5,8) next, which is closer to the center and enemy territory.\n4. **SAFETY**: Enemy at (2,7) - he's going RIGHT (x=2\u21923) or UP (y=7\u21928). No collision threat. My body at (6,8) is far from (5,9).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat apple at (5,9), grow to 2-0, then move DOWN to (5,8) to approach center. Snake #0 is weak (0 apples) and on left side. We'll cut off his access to right side apples and force him into a corner. After eating, our body will be at [(5,9), (6,8)] - we'll have a nice vertical barrier on the right.\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE EATING THIS APPLE! LET'S GOOOOO!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Let's assess the battlefield from our new position at (5,8).\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My snake:** Head at (5,8), Body: [(5,9), (6,9)] - We're vertical on the right side, head just below the top edge.\n- **Enemy snake:** Head at (4,7) - Wait, he moved! He was at (3,7) last turn, now he's at (4,7). He went RIGHT. He's trying to close in on the center apples at (5,5) and (6,2).\n- **Board:** Apples are everywhere, but we're ignoring them to hunt the snake.\n\n**ANALYZING FROM (5,8):**\n\n**UP to (5,9):**\n- \u274c MY OWN BODY! (5,9) is my first body segment. Moving here = instant death. Never backtrack into yourself!\n\n**DOWN to (5,7):**\n- \u2705 On board.\n- \u2705 Safe (my body is at (5,9) and (6,9) - nowhere near).\n- \u2705 Enemy at (4,7) - No collision risk this turn (different column).\n- \ud83d\udcca **STRONG MOVE.** This positions me to the left of the enemy (5,7) vs (4,7). From here, I can go LEFT to (4,7) next turn... but if he moves RIGHT to (5,7) at the same time, we collide! With my 2-0 lead, a head-on collision favors ME! I win if we tie apples? No, we both die. Wait, let's check rules: \"If ALL snakes die... game ends IMMEDIATELY... snake with more apples wins.\" If we both crash, I win 2-0!\n- \ud83d\udcca Or I can go DOWN to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,7) to flank him. Keeps options open.\n\n**LEFT to (4,8):**\n- \u2705 On board.\n- \u2705 Safe (no bodies here).\n- \ud83d\udcca Aggressive! Moves me directly into the enemy's space. From here, I can attack DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,8).\n- \ud83d\udcca **HIGH RISK/REWARD.** If I go LEFT to (4,8) and Snake #0 moves UP to (4,8)... we both crash! Double death. Since I have 2 apples and he has 0, I WIN! This is a forced win opportunity if he's predictable.\n- \ud83d\udcca However, if he moves DOWN to (4,6) or LEFT to (3,7), I survive but might be slightly out of position. Still, (4,8) is central and powerful.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,8):**\n- \u274c OFF BOARD? No, (6,8) is on the board. Wait, is it safe? My body is at (6,9) and (5,9). (6,8) is NOT my body. But looking at my body list: [(5,9), (6,9)]. So (6,8) is empty.\n- \u2705 Safe.\n- \ud83d\udcca Moves me away from the enemy. He's at (4,7), I'm going to (6,8). This is a defensive move. It doesn't pressure him. It gives him more room to grab apples. We want to **BOX HIM IN**, not run away.\n- \ud83d\udcca This is the weakest move strategically. We're leading, we need to push.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe're the bigger snake! We dictate the flow. Snake #0 is at (4,7) - he's in the middle of the board, exposed. We need to pinch him.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,8)** is the **RUTHLESS CHOICE**. Why?\n  1. **IMMEDIATE THREAT:** I'm moving directly into his potential path. From (4,8), I can strike down to (4,7) next turn.\n  2. **COLLISION GAMBLE:** If he moves UP to (4,8) this turn (chasing an apple? Maybe), we BOTH die. Score: Me 2, Him 0. **I WIN.** This is a calculated risk. He's at 0 apples, he's hungry, he might move toward apples. The apple at (5,5) is down-left from him. (4,6) is down-left. (3,4) is left-down. He's not likely to move UP blindly. But if he does? Free win.\n  3. **POSITIONING:** (4,8) is a powerful vantage point. It cuts off the top-left quadrant. It puts me on top of him. It forces him to react.\n  4. **FUTURE MOVES:** From (4,8), I can go DOWN to (4,7) (attack), LEFT to (3,8) (cut off), or BACK to (5,8) (retreat). I control the space.\n\n- **DOWN to (5,7)** is the **CALCULATED CHOICE**. It's safer, positions me to the right of him, and sets up a possible head-on collision if he moves RIGHT. But it doesn't apply direct pressure on his cell.\n\n**LET'S GO FOR THE KILL!** We're playing to WIN, not to survive. Moving LEFT to (4,8) puts us in the driver's seat. If he panics and moves into us, we win. If he runs, we chase him into the corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (4,8). Next turn, if he's at (4,7) or nearby, I'm going DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,8) to trap him. I want him running out of space. We're the apex predator here. Let's squeeze him out!\n\n**CHAT, WATCH US PRESSURE HIM INTO A MISTAKE! LEFT!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

He might move DOWN or LEFT to chase apples. But if he moves UP to (4,8)\u2026 we crash anyway. This is a gamble.  \n- \ud83d\udcca High risk, high reward. If he\u2019s predictable, I win.

No backflips, team.\n- Safe options: DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6).\n\nWhy DOWN?

You feel me? \ud83d\ude24\n\nIf the apple at (5,5) is still there next turn, you can snap RIGHT to (5,5) and eat, boosting your score toward parity with him. If that apple disappears, you still have a safe corridor around (4,5) to maneuver and pressure without getting boxed in.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns): stay centered, keep multiple exit options, and look for opportunities to force favorable trades rather than hard clashes.

Moving into my own body = game over. NOPE!\n\n**DOWN to (3,6):**  \n- \u2705 On board (y=6 is valid)\n- \u2705 Safe? Check: My body is at (3,8) and (4,8) - (3,6) is empty. Enemy body is at (4,5) and (4,6) - (3,6) is empty. Enemy head at (5,5) is not there.\n- \ud83d\udcca This moves me toward the bottom of the board. There's an apple at (3,4) below that I could potentially reach. Also keeps me close to the center. Good for maintaining options. I could go LEFT to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6) [but wait, (4,6) is enemy body!], or DOWN to (3,5) next.\n\n**LEFT to (2,7):**  \n- \u2705 On board (x=2 is valid)\n- \u2705 Safe? My body: (3,8), (4,8) - empty. Enemy body: (4,5), (4,6) - empty. Enemy head: (5,5) - empty.\n- \ud83d\udcca This moves me left toward the apples at (2,4), (2,1). Good for scoring. From (2,7), I could go UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7) [which would be backwards into my old position but that's not an immediate collision unless my tail stays there... wait, my tail moves after I move. Actually, moving back to (3,7) would be safe if my tail moves away. But let's not think that far.]\n\n**RIGHT to (4,7):**  \n- \u2705 On board (x=4 is valid)\n- \u2705 Safe? My body: (3,8), (4,8) - (4,7) is empty. Enemy body: (4,5), (4,6) - (4,7) is empty. Enemy head: (5,5) - (4,7) is empty.\n- \ud83d\udcca This moves me right toward the enemy! I'd be at (4,7), directly above the enemy's body at (4,6) and (4,5). From there, I could go DOWN to (4,6) next turn... but (4,6) is enemy body! So that would kill me. Alternatively, I could go RIGHT to (5,7) or LEFT to (3,7) or UP to (4,8) [but (4,8) is my own body!]. Actually UP to (4,8) would be my own body segment - also death. So from (4,7), my options would be limited: LEFT (3,7), DOWN (death), RIGHT (5,7), UP (death). That's only 2 safe moves. Not ideal.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI want to dominate and force the enemy into a corner. He's at (5,5) with body at (4,5) and (4,6). He's in the center-right. I'm at (3,7) on the left side.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6):\n- I move toward the bottom area, closer to apples like (3,4) and (2,1)\n- I maintain multiple options: LEFT to (2,6), DOWN to (3,5), maybe even RIGHT to (4,6) if he moves away (but (4,6) is currently his body, so I'd need to be careful)\n- I'm not getting trapped\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7):\n- I move toward apples at (2,4), (2,1)\n- I maintain options: UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), RIGHT to (3,7)\n- But I'm moving away from the enemy, giving him more space to dominate the center\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,7):\n- I get closer to the enemy, but I'm limiting my own options significantly\n- From (4,7), I'd be in a potentially dangerous position with limited escape routes\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI need to score more apples to get ahead in points. The apples at (3,4) and (2,4) are relatively close to me. But more importantly, I want to control space and limit the enemy's movement. The enemy is near the center, and if I can push toward the bottom-left corner, I might be able to trap him against the right wall or bottom edge.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's possible moves. He's at (5,5). He could go UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5) [but that's his own body!], or RIGHT to (6,5). LEFT is dangerous for him because (4,5) is his body. So he'll likely go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6):\n- If he goes RIGHT to (6,5), I'm still safe\n- If he goes UP to (5,6), I'm still safe  \n- If he goes DOWN to (5,4), I'm still safe\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7):\n- Same safety\n\nBut DOWN gives me better access to apples and maintains pressure on the bottom half of the board. I want to eventually swing around and cut off his escape routes.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- DOWN: No immediate danger. Multiple follow-up options. Good positioning.\n- LEFT: No immediate danger. Multiple follow-up options. But moving away from enemy.\n- RIGHT: No immediate danger but LIMITS my options significantly. Risky.\n- UP: Death.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nDOWN is the best move. It keeps me safe, maintains options, moves me toward apples, and allows me to continue applying pressure on the enemy's flank. I'm setting up to control the lower half of the board while the enemy is in the middle-right.\n\n**LET'S CRUSH HIM! DOWN!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN",

This keeps me in the center-left, moving toward apples at (3, 4) and (2, 4).\n\n**LEFT to (2, 6):** \u2705 On board, safe! (2, 6) is empty. Moves me toward apples at (2, 4) and (2, 1). From here I could go DOWN to (2, 5) or LEFT to (1, 6) or DOWN-LEFT toward more apples.\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 6):** \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** Enemy body segment is at (4, 5) and (4, 6)? Wait, enemy body is [(5, 5), (4, 5)] - actually (4, 6) IS empty! Let me check again... Enemy head at (6, 5), body: [(5, 5), (4, 5)]. So (4, 6) is empty! But moving RIGHT puts me at (4, 6), which is ABOVE the enemy's body at (4, 5). This is risky because from (4, 6) my options are limited: I can't go DOWN to (4, 5) (enemy body), can't go UP to (4, 7) (my own body?), wait my body is at (3, 7) and (3, 8), so (4, 7) is empty. Actually from (4, 6) I could go LEFT (back to 3,6), RIGHT to (5,6), UP to (4,7), or DOWN (death to enemy body). So 3 safe moves. Not terrible but...\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI want to control the bottom-left quadrant! The enemy is center-right at (6, 5). If I go DOWN to (3, 5), I'm getting closer to apples at (3, 4) and (2, 4), and I maintain access to the bottom edge. If I go LEFT to (2, 6), I'm moving toward the left wall and apples at (2, 4), (2, 1), (1, 4).\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nI need to box him in! He's on the right side, I'm on the left. If I can secure the left side and bottom, I can force him into the top-right corner where he'll have fewer escape routes. Moving DOWN gives me better access to the apple at (3, 4) and keeps my pathing flexible. LEFT is also good but I'm already at x=3, x=2 isn't that much further left than x=3.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN to (3, 5) is the play! It maintains safety, gives me better board control, and sets up for apple collection. From (3, 5) I can go LEFT to (2, 5), DOWN to (3, 4) [that's an apple!], or RIGHT to (4, 5) but (4, 5) is enemy body so actually RIGHT would be death. Wait, from (3, 5) if I go RIGHT to (4, 5) next turn, that's enemy body - death! But that's next turn, we'll reassess then.\n\nActually hold up... From (3, 5) my options would be:\n- UP back to (3, 6)\n- DOWN to (3, 4) [APPLE!]\n- LEFT to (2, 5)\n- RIGHT to (4, 5) [ENEMY BODY - DEATH]\n\nSo 3 safe moves including an apple at (3, 4).

If I can edge ahead on apples, I\u2019ll pressure for a boxed-in head-on on favorable terms; otherwise I keep mobility and avoid dead-ends.\n\nTurn plan: Move UP to (6,7). Then reassess the rival\u2019s movement; target safe apple growth opportunities (notably around (6,8)/(7,9)) while keeping two exits open to dodge any chase.\n\nDecision:\nUP",

From there I can go DOWN to (2, 3), UP to (2, 5), or LEFT to (1, 4). Another great apple grab!\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell. Enemy is at (6, 7), nowhere near.

Two moves away: (7,7) -> (7,8) -> (7,9) to eat on the next turn.\n  - It keeps you centered and away from the opponent\u2019s vertical wall on x=3, reducing risk of a corner trap.\n  - It preserves multiple safe follow-ups; you won\u2019t be forced into a tight squeeze like some RIGHT paths might later.\n\n- WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE SHORT TERM:\n  - Turn 12: eat the apple at (7,9) if you keep moving UP.\n  - Score progression: you go from 2 to 3 apples; opponent is at 4.

Now I'm at head (1,4) with body at [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].\n\nI need to check for immediate collisions for my next move. The enemy is at (7,8) with body [(7,7), (6,7)]. He is far away, but he will move simultaneously. I need to ensure I don't move into a spot he moves into. I can't predict his move, but I can predict mine.\n\nCurrent Head: (1,4).\nCurrent Body adjacent to head: (2,4).\nCells to avoid:\n- My own body: (2,4) (immediate right).\n- The cell behind my head: (0,4) (since I came from (2,4)? No, I came from (2,4) to (1,4). The previous head was (2,4). The cell behind my head is (2,4). Actually, wait. The rule is \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)\". If I am at (1,4), and I came from (2,4), the cell \"behind\" me is (2,4). If I go RIGHT to (3,4), that is NOT the cell behind me. The cell behind me is the one I just left. But wait, if I go LEFT, that is further away from my body. If I go DOWN to (1,3), that is away from my body. If I go UP to (1,5), away from my body.\n- Enemy body: (7,7), (6,7). Far.\n- Enemy head: (7,8). Far.\n\nWait, looking at the board state:\n9 . . . . . . . A . .\n8 . . . . . . A 0 . A\n7 . . . T . . T T . A\n6 . . A T . . . . . .\n5 A . . T . . . . . A\n4 . 1 T T . . . A . .  <-- (1,4) is head. (2,4) is body.\n3 . . . A . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . A . A .\n1 . . A . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . A . A A .\n\nI need to look at the cell to my left: (0,4). Is it empty? The board shows at y=4: `. 1 T T . . . A . .`\nCoordinates: (0,4) is the first character `.`, so (0,4) is empty.\nCoordinates (1,4) is `1`.\nCoordinates (2,4) is `T`.\nCoordinates (3,4) is `T`.\n\nIs (0,4) an apple? The apple list: (8,0), (0,5), (6,2), (9,5), (7,4), (7,0), (5,0), (7,9), (8,2), (3,3), (6,8), (2,1), (9,7), (9,8), (2,6). (0,4) is NOT in the apple list. So (0,4) is just empty space.\n\nIs (1,3) an apple? (1,3) is `.`. (3,3) is `A`. So (1,3) is empty.\nIs (1,5) an apple? (1,5) is `.` (Row 5: `A . . T . . . . . A`). So (1,5) is empty.\n\nLet's look for apples to go to.\nNearest apples:\n(2,1) - Down and Left.\n(3,3) - Down and Right.\n(0,5) - Up and Left.\n(7,4) - Right (Far).\n(8,0) - Far.\n(0,5) is at x=0, y=5. I am at (1,4).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am getting closer to (0,5). If I go LEFT to (0,4), I am closer to (0,5).\n(3,3) is at x=3, y=3. I am at (1,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I am closer to (3,3). If I go RIGHT to (2,4), I hit my body (DEAD).\n\nLet's analyze the options from (1,4):\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (2,4):**\n    *   (2,4) is part of my body (it's the first element of my body list).\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death. **INVALID.**\n\n2.  **UP to (1,5):**\n    *   Coordinates: (1,5).\n    *   Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? No (My body is at y=4 and y=6+).\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   Is it apple? No.\n    *   Is it backwards? The cell behind my head is (2,4). (1,5) is not (2,4). Safe.\n    *   **Future safety:** From (1,5), I can go UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4) (body), LEFT to (0,5) (Apple!), RIGHT to (2,5) (Empty). 3 options.\n    *   **Content:** No apple immediately.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (1,3):**\n    *   Coordinates: (1,3).\n    *   Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   Is it apple? No.\n    *   Is it backwards? No.\n    *   **Future safety:** From (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4) (body), DOWN to (1,2), LEFT to (0,3), RIGHT to (2,3). 3 options.\n    *   **Content:** No apple immediately. But leads to (3,3) or (2,1).\n\n4.  **LEFT to (0,4):**\n    *   Coordinates: (0,4).\n    *   Is it on board? Yes (x=0 is valid).\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   Is it apple? No.\n    *   Is it backwards? No.\n    *   **Future safety:** From (0,4), I am on the left wall. I can go UP to (0,5) (Apple!), DOWN to (0,3), RIGHT to (1,4) (body). 2 viable moves.\n    *   **Content:** No apple immediately.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **RIGHT** is death.\n- **UP, DOWN, LEFT** are all safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nI want to eat apples. (0,5) is an apple. It is at x=0, y=5.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0,4), my next move can be **UP** to (0,5) to eat the apple.\nIf I go **UP** to (1,5), I can go **LEFT** to (0,5) to eat the apple.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (1,3), I am moving away from (0,5). I would have to go UP twice to get it, risking the apple being gone (though 100 turns left, apples respawn usually, but dominating space is key).\n\n**Enemy Position:**\nEnemy is at (7,8). He is NE.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am moving to the far West. This is good for boxing him out because it secures the left edge.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am moving center-left.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I am moving bottom-left.\n\n**Board State Analysis:**\nMy body is blocking a column at x=2 and x=3 for y=4 to 7.\nIf I move LEFT to (0,4), I open up the left wall.\nIf I move UP to (1,5), I am moving towards the center but staying out of my body's way.\n\n**Let's look at the apples again:**\n(0,5) is very close.\n(3,3) is close.\n(2,1) is close.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (0,5) (Apple).\n- Or DOWN to (0,3).\n\nIf I go UP to (1,5):\n- Next turn I can go LEFT to (0,5) (Apple).\n- Or UP to (1,6).\n- Or RIGHT to (2,5).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3):\n- Next turn I can go LEFT to (0,3).\n- Or DOWN to (1,2).\n- Or RIGHT to (2,3).\n\n**The decision:**\nI am currently at (1,4). My previous move was LEFT (from 2,4 to 1,4). I ate an apple there.\nI should keep moving towards apples.\n(0,5) is the nearest apple I can reach efficiently.\n(3,3) is also reachable.\n\nLet's consider the geometry. My body is currently occupying (2,4) to (3,7).\nIf I go **LEFT to (0,4)**:\n- I am freeing up (1,4) for my body to move into later.\n- I am approaching the wall.\n- I can easily grab (0,5) next turn.\n\nIf I go **UP to (1,5)**:\n- I am moving parallel to my body (which is at y=4 to 7).\n- I might get boxed in by my own body if I go too high.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (1,3)**:\n- I am moving towards (2,1) and (3,3).\n\n**Wait, look at the board again for (0,5).**\nRow 5: `A . . T . . . . . A`\n(0,5) is `A`. Yes.\nRow 4: `. 1 T T . . . A . .`\n(0,4) is `.`.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am adjacent to the apple at (0,5).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am adjacent to the apple at (0,5).\n\nIs there any danger?\nThe enemy is at (7,8). He moves 1 step. He cannot reach me.\nMy own body is not an issue if I don't move into it.\n\n**Why LEFT?**\nI am at (1,4). To get to (0,5), going LEFT then UP is a 90 degree turn.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), then LEFT to (0,5), it's also a 90 degree turn.\nHowever, staying at x=1 keeps me slightly more central.\nBut moving to x=0 secures the left flank.\nActually, looking at the apple list, (0,5) is the only apple at x=0 (besides maybe others? No, (0,5) is the only one at x=0).\nActually, (0,5) is the target.\n\nLet's look at the board.\n9 . . . . . . . A . .\n8 . . . . . . A 0 . A\n7 . . . T . . T T . A\n6 . . A T . . . . . .\n5 A . . T . . . . . A\n4 . 1 T T . . . A . .\n3 . . . A . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . A . A .\n1 . . A . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . A . A A .\n\nMy body is at x=2,3. Moving to x=0 keeps me away from my body.\nMoving to x=1 keeps me closer to my body.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am at x=1, y=5.\nMy body is at x=2,3 for y=4..7.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am \"outside\" my body loop.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am also outside.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer UP?\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I can reach (3,3) later by going DOWN, LEFT, DOWN... it's complicated.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am committed to the left wall.\nThe left wall has (0,5).\nThe bottom left has (2,1).\nThe bottom right has (8,0).\n\nLet's check the apple (3,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I am getting closer to (3,3).\n(3,3) is `A` (Row 3: `. . . A . . . . . .`)\nMy body is at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\nSo (3,3) is directly below my body at (3,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), then RIGHT to (2,3), then I can go UP to (2,4) (My own body, DEAD).\nWait, if I go DOWN to (1,3), I can go RIGHT to (2,3).\nFrom (2,3), I can go DOWN to (2,2) or UP to (2,4) (Body) or LEFT to (1,3) (Body soon) or RIGHT to (3,3) (Apple).\nFrom (2,3), going RIGHT to (3,3) is safe because (3,3) is an apple and (3,4) is my body, but I am moving into (3,3), not (3,4).\nSo DOWN path is valid.\n\n**Comparing paths to apples:**\nTarget (0,5): Move LEFT, then UP. Or UP, then LEFT.\nTarget (3,3): Move DOWN, then RIGHT, then RIGHT.\nTarget (2,1): Move DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT.\n\nCurrent Position: (1,4).\nDistance to (0,5): 2 steps (Manhattan).\nDistance to (3,3): 3 steps.\nDistance to (2,1): 4 steps.\n\n(0,5) is the closest apple.\nI should move towards (0,5).\nOptions to move towards (0,5):\n- LEFT to (0,4)\n- UP to (1,5)\n\nWhich is better?\nIf I go UP to (1,5):\n- I am at (1,5).\n- Next turn, I can go LEFT to (0,5) (Apple).\n- From (1,5), I can also go UP to (1,6), RIGHT to (2,5).\n- (2,5) is empty (Row 5: `A . . T . . . . . A` -> index 2 is `.`).\n- However, (1,5) is close to my body at (3,4) etc.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4):\n- I am at (0,4).\n- Next turn, I can go UP to (0,5) (Apple).\n- From (0,4), I can go DOWN to (0,3).\n- I am on the wall. Wall limits movement but also provides a hard boundary for boxing in the enemy.\n- My body is at x=2,3. By going to x=0, I am keeping a gap between me and my body.\n- If I go UP to (1,5), I am at x=1, close to my body at x=2.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nEnemy at (7,8). Body at (7,7), (6,7).\nHe is in the top right.\nI am in the bottom left.\nBoxing him in means taking space.\nIf I take the left wall (x=0), I am securing the perimeter.\nIf I stay at x=1, I am still \"central\" left.\n\nLet's look at the board layout.\nMy body forms a vertical line at x=2 and x=3 from y=4 to y=7.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am \"inside\" the curve of my body (if I consider my body as a wall).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am \"outside\" the curve.\n\nLet's check safety of (0,4).\nIs there any apple at (0,4)? No.\nIs there any snake at (0,4)? No.\nIs there any future trap at (0,4)?\nFrom (0,4), I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nFrom (1,4), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n(1,4) allows moving LEFT (to 0,4) or UP or DOWN.\n(0,4) allows moving UP, DOWN, RIGHT (to 1,4).\n(0,4) is slightly more restricted (3 moves vs 3 moves, but RIGHT leads back to 1,4).\nActually, (1,4) is currently occupied by my head. The previous head was (2,4).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), the tail moves. The tail is at (3,7). The body moves to fill (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4).\nSo next turn, my body will be at (1,4).\nIf I am at (0,4), my body is at (1,4).\nMy next moves from (0,4):\n- UP (0,5): Empty (for now).\n- DOWN (0,3): Empty.\n- RIGHT (1,4): My own body (Deadly).\nSo from (0,4), I effectively have 2 moves (UP and DOWN). RIGHT is suicide.\nFrom (1,4), I have:\n- UP (1,5): Empty.\n- DOWN (1,3): Empty.\n- LEFT (0,4): Empty.\n(1,4) has 3 moves.\n(0,4) has 2 moves.\nThis suggests (1,4) is safer than (0,4) in terms of future options.\n\nHowever, I want to grab the apple at (0,5).\nTo grab (0,5), I need to be adjacent to it.\nAdjacent cells to (0,5): (0,4), (0,6), (1,5).\nI am currently at (1,4).\nIf I move UP to (1,5), I will be at (1,5), adjacent to (0,5).\nIf I move LEFT to (0,4), I will be at (0,4), adjacent to (0,5).\n\nLet's consider the \"Boxing In\" strategy.\nI am leading 5-2. I have 5 apples. He has 2.\nI should pressure him.\nHe is at (7,8).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am moving towards the center/top.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am moving to the edge.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApple at (0,5).\nApple at (3,3).\nApple at (2,1).\nApple at (7,4) - This is on the right side, near the enemy. I should probably avoid going that way unless I want to hunt him. But he is at (7,8), so (7,4) is south of him.\nApple at (6,2).\n\nMy goal is to dominate the board.\nIf I go UP to (1,5):\n- I am moving towards (0,5).\n- I am also potentially moving towards (3,3) or (2,6) or (6,8) if I loop around.\n- But I am currently in the bottom left.\n- (1,5) is a solid move. It keeps me away from the wall for now.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3):\n- I am moving towards (2,1) and (3,3).\n- (2,1) is `A`.\n- (3,3) is `A`.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4):\n- I am committing to the wall.\n- It's a \"safe\" move because it's on the edge, but it reduces my options.\n- However, it brings me directly next to the apple (0,5).\n\n**Wait, look at the board state again.**\nRow 4: `. 1 T T . . . A . .`\nRow 5: `A . . T . . . . . A`\nMy body is at (2,4), (3,4).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am at (1,5).\nMy body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)...\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am \"above\" my body column at x=2,3.\nThis looks like a good position to expand.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am \"left\" of my body.\nThis is also good.\n\nLet's calculate the value of each move based on apples.\nTarget (0,5): Value High (Closest).\nTarget (3,3): Value Medium.\nTarget (2,1): Value Low-Medium.\n\nMove UP (1,5):\n- Distance to (0,5): 1 step (Manhattan).\n- Distance to (3,3): 4 steps.\n- Distance to (2,1): 5 steps.\n- Next turn options: (0,5), (1,6), (2,5). 3 options. (1,4) is body).\n\nMove LEFT (0,4):\n- Distance to (0,5): 1 step.\n- Distance to (3,3): 5 steps.\n- Distance to (2,1): 5 steps.\n- Next turn options: (0,5), (0,3). 2 options. (1,4) is body.\n\nMove DOWN (1,3):\n- Distance to (0,5): 3 steps.\n- Distance to (3,3): 3 steps.\n- Distance to (2,1): 3 steps.\n- Next turn options: (0,3), (1,2), (2,3). 3 options. (1,4) is body.\n\n**The Strategy:**\nI have a lead. I want to keep it.\nI should go for the apple.\n(0,5) is the easiest apple to get.\nBetween UP and LEFT, which gets me to (0,5) more effectively?\nIf I go UP to (1,5), next turn I go LEFT to (0,5). I eat the apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), next turn I go UP to (0,5). I eat the apple.\n\nIs there any advantage to being at (1,5) vs (0,4)?\n(1,5) is more central. It allows me to access the center of the board easier.\n(0,4) is on the wall. It allows me to secure the perimeter.\nSince I am playing to \"box him in\", securing the perimeter (walls) is important.\nHowever, (1,5) is not the wall, but it's close.\n(0,4) IS the wall.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nEnemy is at (7,8).\nIf I secure the left wall, I cut off half the board.\nIf I stay at (1,5), I still control the left side.\n(1,5) is \"outside\" my body. My body is at x=2,3.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am not trapping myself.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am putting my back to the wall.\nIn Snake, having your back to the wall is generally safer because you can't be attacked from behind (only from 3 sides).\nHowever, it limits escape routes.\nBut I have a massive lead. I can afford to play a bit tighter.\n\nLet's check the apple at (3,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I am also going for an apple, but it's further away.\n(0,5) is right there.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates for (0,5).\nApple list: (0, 5) is present.\nBoard state: Row 5, Col 0 is 'A'. Yes.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates for (3,3).\nApple list: (3, 3) is present.\nBoard state: Row 3, Col 3 is 'A'. Yes.\n\nLet's verify (2,1).\nApple list: (2, 1) is present.\nBoard state: Row 1, Col 2 is 'A'. Yes.\n\nOkay, the apples are there.\n\nLet's look at the \"Boxing In\" instruction.\n\"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nBoxing him in means taking space.\nTaking the wall is the ultimate boxing in strategy.\nBy moving to (0,4), I am hugging the wall.\nBy moving to (1,5), I am floating.\n\nHowever, if I move to (0,4), and he moves to (6,8), etc., I can eventually trap him in the corner.\nIf I move to (1,5), I am more flexible.\n\nLet's consider the \"Archrival\" aspect.\nHe has 2 apples. I have 5.\nI am winning.\nI should play safe.\n(0,4) is safe. (1,5) is safe.\n(1,5) gives me more space to maneuver.\n(0,4) gives me less space.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (0,4), I am at the edge.\nNext turn, I can go UP to (0,5) (Apple).\nFrom (0,5), I can go UP to (0,6).\nFrom (0,6), I can go RIGHT to (1,6).\nThis is a safe loop around the top-left corner.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I can go LEFT to (0,5) (Apple).\nFrom (0,5), I can go UP to (0,6).\nOr I can go RIGHT to (1,6).\nThis is also a safe loop.\n\nThe key difference is the immediate move.\nIf I go LEFT, I am one step closer to the wall.\nIf I go UP, I am one step higher.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nHe is at (7,8).\nPossible moves: (7,9) [Wall? Board is 0-9. y=9 is valid. Row 9 exists.], (7,7) [Body], (6,8), (8,8).\n(7,9) is `A` (Row 9: `. . . . . . . A . .`). So he might go for the apple at (7,9).\n(6,8) is `A` (Row 8: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`). Wait, (6,8) is `A`. Yes.\nSo he has two apples right next to him: (7,9) and (6,8).\nHe will likely go for one of those.\nIf he goes for (7,9), he moves UP.\nIf he goes for (6,8), he moves LEFT.\nIf he goes for (8,8), he moves RIGHT (Empty).\nIf he goes for (7,7), he moves DOWN (Body).\n\nHe is not a threat to me this turn.\n\nSo I can safely go for my apple.\n\nLet's decide between UP and LEFT.\nI am at (1,4).\nMy body is at (2,4), (3,4)...\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am at y=5.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am at x=0.\n\nThere is an apple at (3,3).\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from (3,3).\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from (3,3).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards (3,3) and (2,1).\nBut (0,5) is closer than (3,3).\n(0,5) is 2 steps away.\n(3,3) is 3 steps away.\n\nLet's look at the \"Growth\" aspect.\nI have 5 apples. I want 6.\n(0,5) is the fastest way to 6 apples.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am next to (0,5).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am next to (0,5).\n\nIs there any benefit to being at (0,4) over (1,5)?\n(0,4) is on the edge. This effectively removes one direction of movement (LEFT is off board).\nHowever, it means I can't be surrounded from the left.\n(1,5) is open on all sides (except body).\nIn Snake, playing the edges is a classic strategy to control space.\nGiven I want to \"box him in\", controlling the perimeter is key.\n\nLet's check the corners.\n(0,9) is top-left.\n(9,9) is top-right (Enemy area).\n(0,0) is bottom-left.\n(9,0) is bottom-right.\n\nI am currently near the bottom-left.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am securing the left edge.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am moving towards the top-left.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 4: `. 1 T T . . . A . .`\nIf I go UP to (1,5):\nRow 5: `A . . T . . . . . A`\nI am at (1,5).\nMy body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)...\nThis forms a \"hook\" shape.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4):\nRow 4: `1 . T T . . . A . .`\nI am at (0,4).\nMy body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)...\nThis forms a line at the bottom.\n\nLet's look at the \"Boxing In\" strategy.\nTo box him in, I need to control the walls.\nThe left wall is free.\nThe top wall is partially occupied by apples.\nThe bottom wall is partially occupied by apples.\nThe right wall is where the enemy is.\n\nIf I take the left wall now, I am claiming territory.\n(0,4) is a claim on the left wall.\n(1,5) is a claim on the inner space.\n\nLet's consider the apple (0,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I can eat (0,5) next turn.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I can eat (0,5) next turn.\nBoth paths allow eating (0,5).\n\nWhat about the turn after that?\nIf I am at (0,5) (after eating):\n- I can go UP to (0,6).\n- I can go RIGHT to (1,5).\n- I can't go DOWN (body will be there? No, body moves).\nIf I am at (0,5), my body will be at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)...\nSo (0,6) and (1,5) are free.\n\nIf I am at (1,5) (and haven't eaten yet):\n- I can go LEFT to (0,5) (Apple).\n- I can go UP to (1,6).\n- I can go RIGHT to (2,5).\n- I can't go DOWN (body).\n\nThe board state shows apples at (0,5) and (3,3).\nThere is also an apple at (2,1).\nThere is an apple at (6,2).\nThere is an apple at (8,0).\n\nI am at (1,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I am heading towards (2,1) and (3,3).\n(2,1) is an apple.\n(3,3) is an apple.\nBut (0,5) is closer.\n\nLet's look at the \"Aggressive\" instruction.\n\"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to your enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have 5 apples. He has 2. I am winning.\nI should keep growing to maintain the lead and pressure.\nEating apples is growing.\n(0,5) is the easiest apple to eat.\n\nLet's look at the \"Boxing In\" instruction again.\n\"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nIf I secure the left wall, I trap him on the right side.\nIf I move UP to (1,5), I am not securing the wall yet.\nIf I move LEFT to (0,4), I am starting to secure the wall.\n\nLet's check the board size. 10x10.\nMy body is currently 6 segments long (Head + 5 body).\nHe is 3 segments long (Head + 2 body).\nI am bigger.\nI can use my body to create walls.\nMy body is currently at (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\nThis is a vertical bar at x=2,3 from y=4 to y=7.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am adding space to the left of this bar.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am adding space above this bar.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am at (1,5).\nMy body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)...\nThis creates a horizontal bar at y=4 from x=1 to x=3.\nAnd a vertical bar at x=3 from y=4 to y=7.\nThis is a \"L\" shape or a \"step\" shape.\nThis shape is good for cornering.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am at (0,4).\nMy body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)...\nThis creates a horizontal bar at y=4 from x=0 to x=3.\nThis is a solid wall at y=4.\nThis wall blocks the bottom of the board.\nThe enemy is at y=8.\nThis effectively cuts off the bottom 4 rows (y=0 to y=3) from the enemy (unless he goes around the sides).\nBut he is at x=7. To get to y=0-3, he would have to go around my body.\nMy body is at y=4.\nIf I build a wall at y=4, I trap him in the top rows.\nThis is a EXCELLENT boxing strategy.\n\nSo, moving LEFT to (0,4) helps build a wall at y=4.\nMoving UP to (1,5) raises the wall to y=5 (partially).\nMoving DOWN to (1,3) lowers the wall to y=3 (partially).\n\nThe current wall is at y=4 (my body is at y=4).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I extend the wall to x=0.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I move the head to y=5, but the body will fill y=4.\nWait, if I go UP, the body moves. The tail leaves (3,7). The body shifts.\nHead moves to (1,5).\nOld head (1,4) becomes body.\nOld body (2,4) becomes body.\n...\nThe body will be at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\nSo the wall at y=4 (x=1 to 3) remains!\nAnd I am at y=5.\nSo moving UP puts me \"above\" my wall.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4):\nHead moves to (0,4).\nBody becomes (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\nWall at y=4 is extended to x=0.\nI am \"on\" the wall.\n\nGiven the objective is to \"box him in\", extending the wall seems better.\nBy moving LEFT, I secure the left edge and extend the horizontal barrier at y=4.\nThis forces the enemy to stay in y > 4.\nThe enemy is at y=8.\nThis is good containment.\n\nLet's double check safety.\nMove LEFT to (0,4).\nIs (0,4) safe?\nYes, it's empty.\nIs it backwards?\nPrevious head was (1,4). Behind me is (2,4). (0,4) is not (2,4).\nIs it off-board? No.\nIs it into enemy body? No.\nIs it into my body? No.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go to (0,4), I am on the edge.\nNext turn, I can go UP to (0,5) (Apple).\nOr DOWN to (0,3).\nI cannot go LEFT.\nI can go RIGHT to (1,4) (which will be body).\nSo I have 2 viable moves.\nThis is slightly restricted, but safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,5):\nI can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nDOWN is (1,4) (Body).\nUP is (1,6) (Empty).\nLEFT is (0,5) (Apple).\nRIGHT is (2,5) (Empty).\n3 viable moves.\nMore options.\n\nHowever, the \"Boxing In\" strategy takes priority.\n\"Boxing him in\" means restricting HIS options, not necessarily mine.\nBy building a wall at y=4 (extending it to x=0), I restrict HIM to y>4.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am at y=5. The wall is still at y=4 (effectively).\nBut by being at (0,4), I am claiming the corner.\n(0,4) is part of the perimeter.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (0,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am adjacent to (0,5).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am also adjacent to (0,5).\nBoth allow eating the apple next turn.\nBut (0,4) puts me in the corner.\n(1,5) puts me in the \"safe zone\" near the corner.\nIn Snake, being in the corner is risky if you are trapped.\nBut if you are doing the trapping, it's power.\nI have 5 apples. He has 2.\nI can afford to play the corner.\nI am bigger. I can cut him off.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nTop right: Enemy at (7,8).\nTop left: Apple at (0,5) etc.\nBottom left: Me at (1,4).\nBottom right: Apples at (8,0), (7,0), (5,0).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the apple at (0,5).\nIf I go UP, I am also moving towards the apple at (0,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards (2,1) and (3,3).\n\n(0,5) is the most valuable move right now because it's the closest apple and it helps me secure the left perimeter.\n\nLet's look at the \"Turn 12\" context.\nI ate an apple at (1,4) last turn (Turn 11).\nSo I am currently at (1,4) and I have 5 apples.\nI need to move.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am setting up for (0,5).\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am setting up for (0,5).\n\nIs there any reason to avoid the wall?\nIf I go to (0,4), I am limiting my future moves to 2 directions (UP, DOWN) effectively.\nIf I go to (1,5), I have 3 directions.\nHowever, if I go to (0,4), I am effectively saying \"I own this edge\".\nThis is a strong statement in Snake.\n\nLet's check the apple at (0,5) again.\nIt is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT, I get closer.\nIf I go UP, I get closer.\n\nLet's check the apple at (3,3).\nIf I go DOWN, I get closer.\n(3,3) is `A`.\nMy body is at (3,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), then RIGHT to (2,3), then RIGHT to (3,3), I eat the apple.\nBut I have to pass through (2,3).\n(2,3) is empty.\nBut (1,3) is empty.\nGoing DOWN seems slower for the immediate apple grab.\n\nLet's compare the \"Boxing In\" potential.\nMy body is currently a vertical bar.\nIf I go LEFT, I extend the bar horizontally.\nIf I go UP, I move above the bar.\nIf I go DOWN, I move below the bar.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,8).\nIf I extend the bar horizontally (LEFT), I effectively cut off the bottom of the board.\nThe enemy is at the top.\nThis is good separation.\n\nLet's assume the enemy wants to come down.\nHe is at (7,8).\nTo get to the bottom left, he has to cross y=4.\nMy body is at y=4 (x=2,3).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), my body will be at x=0,1,2,3 at y=4.\nThis is a solid wall.\nHe cannot cross y=4 at x=0,1,2,3.\nHe would have to go around the sides (x=4,5,6,7,8,9) or over the top.\nThis is effective boxing.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,5), my body will still be at y=4 (x=1,2,3).\nBut I am at y=5.\nThis is slightly less \"solid\" of a wall because I am not hugging the wall at x=0.\nHowever, I am still blocking y=4.\n\nThe difference is minimal.\nBut (0,4) offers the apple at (0,5) next turn.\n(1,5) also offers the apple at (0,5) next turn.\n\nLet's look at the apple list again.\n(0,5) is there.\n(3,3) is there.\n(2,1) is there.\n(7,4) is there.\n(6,2) is there.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), I am securing the perimeter.\nIf I go UP to (1,5), I am floating.\n\"Boxing him in\" implies taking the perimeter.\nTherefore, LEFT is the better move for the strategy.\n\nAlso, if I go LEFT, I am moving to x=0.\nThis is the furthest left I can go.\nThis maximizes the distance between me and the enemy (horizontally).\nEnemy is at x=7. I am at x=0. Distance is 7.\nIf I go UP, I am at x=1. Distance is 6.\nMaximizing distance is good when winning.\n\nSo, LEFT seems to be the winning move.\nIt grabs the closest apple path, extends the wall, and maximizes distance.\n\nLet's just double check if (0,4) is safe.\nBoard state at (0,4): `.` (Empty).\nMy body: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)].\nEnemy body: [(7,7), (6,7)].\nEnemy head: (7,8).\nNone of these are (0,4).\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision?\nIf I move to (0,4), and the enemy moves to (0,4)? Impossible, he is at (7,8).\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs there any risk of self-collision?\nI am moving from (1,4) to (0,4).\nThe cell behind me is (2,4).\n(0,4) is not (2,4).\nSo no self-collision.\n\nIs there any risk of trapping myself?\nFrom (0,4), I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n(0,4) -> UP (0,5) -> Apple.\n(0,4) -> DOWN (0,3) -> Safe.\n(0,4) -> RIGHT (1,4) -> Will be my body next turn.\nSo I have 2 moves next turn.\nThis is acceptable.\n\nIf I went UP to (1,5):\n(1,5) -> UP (1,6).\n(1,5) -> LEFT (0,5) -> Apple.\n(1,5) -> RIGHT (2,5).\n(1,5) -> DOWN (1,4) -> Body.\n3 moves.\nMore flexibility.\n\nBut the \"Boxing In\" strategy favors the wall.\nAlso, (0,4) is closer to the wall.\n(1,5) is \"floating\".\n\nLet's look at the \"Aggressive\" part.\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nTo force a head-on collision, I need to corner him.\nTo corner him, I need to take the walls.\nTaking the wall at (0,4) is step 1.\n\nLet's look at the \"Grow as a means of dominating the board\".\n(0,5) is an apple.\nBoth moves lead to (0,5).\nLEFT is more direct towards the wall.\nUP is more direct towards the center (slightly).\n\nLet's look at the board coordinates.\n(0,4) is the bottom-left corner area.\n(1,5) is slightly up and right.\n\nI will choose **LEFT**.\nIt secures the left edge, sets up the apple, and expands my territory.\n\nOne final check.\nIs there an apple at (0,4)?\nNo.\nIs there an apple at (1,5)?\nNo.\nIs there an apple at (1,3)?\nNo.\nIs there an apple at (2,4)?\nNo (My body is there).\nIs there an apple at (3,4)?\nNo (My body is there).\n\nSo all moves are \"empty\" moves (except RIGHT which is body).\nI am choosing based on future potential and strategy.\nLEFT offers the best strategic position for \"Boxing In\".\n\nWait, I should check if I am moving into a spot where the enemy might move.\nEnemy at (7,8).\nCan he move to (0,4)? No.\nCan he move to (1,5)? No.\nCan he move to (1,3)? No.\nSo all moves are safe from enemy collision.\n\nThe decision is purely based on my own strategy and future apple access.\nLEFT -> (0,4) -> (0,5) [Apple].\nThis is a solid plan.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\nI need to sound like a streamer.\n\"YO WHAT'S UP CHAT!\"\n\"Turn 12!\"\n\"Boxing him in!\"\n\"Securing the left flank!\"\n\"Eating that apple next turn!\"\n\nI will write the plan for the next turn in the rationale.\nPlan: Move to (0,4), then UP to (0,5) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nSo I should write that in the rationale.\n\nFinal check on the move.\nIs it possible that (1,5) is better for \"Boxing In\"?\n(1,5) is not on the wall.\n(0,4) is on the wall.\nTo box someone in, you usually take the walls.\nSo (0,4) is the correct choice.\n\nAlso, (0,4) is a \"corner\" move.\nIn Snake, securing the corners is important for area control.\nI am currently at (1,4).\n(0,4) is the corner.\n(1,5) is not the corner.\nI should take the corner.\n\nOkay, moving LEFT.\n\nOne tiny detail: The board is 0-9.\n(0,4) is valid.\n(0,5) is valid.\n(0,9) is valid.\n\nLet's go.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nYO CHAT! Turn 12 and we are CRUSHING IT! 5-2 lead! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're at (1,4) after grabbing that last apple. Now we gotta keep the pressure on and BOX HIM IN!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- Me: (1,4), 5 apples. Body is a solid wall at x=2,3.\n- Enemy: (7,8), 2 apples. Stuck in the top right.\n- Board: Left side is wide open.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI'm going **LEFT to (0,4)**.\nWhy? We are taking the **PERIMETER**! By moving to the left wall, I secure the edge and set up a massive horizontal barrier with my body. This cuts the board in half and boxes the enemy into the top-right corner!\n\nFrom (0,4), I'm perfectly positioned to eat the apple at (0,5) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\nThis extends my lead to 6-2 and solidifies my control over the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nDominate the left wall. Force the enemy into a tight space where they have no moves left. Use my body to create a cage. Once I have the lead, I'll go for the head-on collision to seal the win!\n\nLet's secure the flank and make him panic!\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**",

We just moved UP to (0,5) and grabbed that apple\u2014now we're extended and ready to pressure.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Our head: (0,5)  \n- Our body: [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]  \n- Enemy head: (6,9) \u2014 top-right corner  \n- Enemy body: [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]\n\n**ANALYZING OUR MOVE OPTIONS FROM (0,5):**\n\n1. **UP to (0,6)**:  \n   - Safe? YES. (0,6) is empty.  \n   - Does it hit ourselves? No.  \n   - Does it hit enemy? No.  \n   - Does it give us apples? No apple there, but opens path upward along the left wall.  \n   - Future options: From (0,6), we can go UP to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,6) or DOWN back to (0,5). Good flexibility.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (1,5)**:  \n   - Safe? (1,5) shows as empty in the board.  \n   - BUT: (1,4) is part of our body. If we go RIGHT now, next turn we could potentially go DOWN into (1,4) which would be hitting ourselves (since the tail might move). However, we need to check: Our tail is currently at (3,6). Our body occupies (0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6). (1,5) is empty.  \n   - However, (1,5) is adjacent to (1,4) which is our body. If we go RIGHT to (1,5), next turn if we go LEFT back to (0,5), that's fine. But if we go DOWN to (1,4), that's moving into our own body segment that will still be there (since tail moves one step later). That could be dangerous.  \n   - Also, from (1,5), we might have limited space. We need to consider enemy movement.\n\n3. **DOWN to (0,4)**:  \n   - Safe? (0,4) is currently our body segment! That's our second segment from the head. Moving DOWN into our own body would kill us immediately. **DEADLY**. ELIMINATE.\n\n4. **LEFT to (-1,5)**:  \n   - Off the board! Dead. ELIMINATE.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. LEFT and DOWN are lethal.\n\nNow, which is BETTER? We need to think about enemy movement. The enemy is at (6,9). They're cornered in the top-right. They have apples around them: (9,5), (9,7), (9,8) are apples. They might go UP to (6,10) but that's off board\u2014so they can't go UP. They can go DOWN to (6,8) (but that's empty), RIGHT to (7,9) but that's their own body! Wait, their head is (6,9), body is (7,9),(7,8),(7,7). So (7,9) is their own body segment. If they go RIGHT, they'd die. LEFT to (5,9) is empty. DOWN to (6,8) is empty. So they have options: LEFT, DOWN, maybe UP? Actually (6,9) is top row y=9, so UP would be y=10 off board\u2014deadly. So they can't go UP.\n\nThey will likely go for an apple. Apple at (9,8) is close. They might go DOWN to (6,8) then later right. Or LEFT to (5,9). Not sure.\n\nWe need to consider long-term: Our goal is to box them in and force a crash. Our body forms a wall from (0,4) to (3,6). If we go RIGHT to (1,5), we might extend our wall eastward, but we also risk cutting off our own movement.\n\nIf we go UP to (0,6), we extend along the left wall, keeping the left side secure and potentially looping around to head them off.\n\nAlso note: There's an apple at (6,8) (see board: row 8, col 6 is \"A\"? Actually board row 8: \". . . . . . A T . A\" so (6,8) is A? Wait coordinates: row 8 (y=8), col 6 (x=6) is \"A\". Yes! That's an apple at (6,8). The enemy might go DOWN to (6,8) to eat it, gaining strength.\n\nWe need to stay alive and plan to cut them off.\n\nLet's think about future moves: If we go UP to (0,6), from there we could go RIGHT to (1,6) which is empty, then further right to (2,6) etc., potentially building a horizontal barrier. But we have to avoid colliding with ourselves.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,5), we're moving closer to the center, but we have body below at (1,4). If we later go UP from (1,5) to (1,6), that's fine. But we need to ensure we don't trap ourselves.\n\nAlso, we should consider the score: 6 vs 3. If we can force a head-on collision now, we'd win because we have more apples. But we need to be in a position where we can predict enemy movement and move into their head's next position simultaneously.\n\nWe can't guarantee that this turn. So we play safe for now.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, UP seems safer because it keeps us along the wall, away from our own body, and gives us more space to maneuver. RIGHT puts us in closer proximity to our own body segments.\n\nAlso, from (0,6), we have a clear path to go UP multiple steps along the left edge, potentially circling around and approaching from the top-left. The enemy is in the top-right, so if we can get to (0,9) or (1,9), we could cut off their escape.\n\nLet's check board: left column (x=0) from y=0 to y=9:  \ny=0: (0,0) is empty (board shows \".\" at (0,0)  \ny=1: (0,1) empty  \ny=2: (0,2) empty  \ny=3: (0,3) empty  \ny=4: (0,4) our body  \ny=5: (0,5) our head  \ny=6: (0,6) empty  \ny=7: (0,7) empty  \ny=8: (0,8) empty  \ny=9: (0,9) empty  \n\nSo the entire left column is empty except our current body. That's a safe corridor.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (0,6) is excellent\u2014it extends our reach into empty space and prepares us to climb up the left wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nClimb up the left wall to y=9, then move right along the top row towards the enemy, boxing them in against the right wall. Ensure we don't trap ourselves. Keep score advantage and look for opportunities to force a head-on collision when we have positional advantage.\n\nNow, final decision: UP is safer, more strategic, and keeps options open. Let's go UP!\n\n**MOVE: UP**",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're on turn 15 and the pressure's building! We're up 6-4 in apples, and I'm not letting this lead slip. Last move we went UP to (0,6) \u2013 smart play, staying safe along the left wall and keeping our options open. Now we're at (0,6) with body stretching down to (3,6). Enemy's at (6,8) probably eyeing that apple at (9,8) like a hawk.\n\n**ANALYZING CURRENT SITUATION FROM (0,6):**\n\n**UP to (0,7):**\n- Safe? (0,7) is empty. No own body, no enemy. Board shows clear path.\n- Advantage: Keeps climbing the left wall. From (0,7) we can go UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7). Both empty. We're building a vertical barrier along the left side while maintaining distance from our own tail.\n- Long-term: Once at (0,8) or (0,9), we can start moving RIGHT toward the top-right corner where the enemy is trapped. We could potentially cut off their escape routes by forming a horizontal line across the top.\n\n**DOWN to (0,5):**\n- Safe? (0,5) was our previous head position \u2013 but wait, it's currently empty because we moved from there last turn. However, our body will move up after our move, so (0,5) will become part of our body again. Actually, moving DOWN into (0,5) is moving into our own body segment that just vacated? Let's think: At the start of turn 15, our head is at (0,6), body includes (0,5). If we move DOWN to (0,5), that's directly moving into our own body. That's suicide! ELIMINATE.\n\n**LEFT to (-1,6):**\n- Off board! Dead. ELIMINATE.\n\n**RIGHT to (1,6):**\n- Safe? (1,6) is empty. No immediate collision.\n- But check: (1,5) is empty? Actually board shows row 5: \"T A . T . . . . . A\" so (1,5) is \"A\"? Wait, coordinates: row 5 (y=5) has \"T\" at (0,5) but we just moved from (0,5) to (0,6) last turn, so (0,5) might be empty now? Actually board is from last turn's state before moving. At turn 15 start, our head at (0,6), body includes (0,5) from previous move. So (0,5) is occupied by our body. (1,5) is \"A\" from board? Actually board row 5: \"T A . T . . . . . A\" means: col0=T, col1=A, col2=., col3=T, etc. So (1,5) is an apple! But if we go RIGHT to (1,6), we're not eating it (it's at y=5). (1,6) is empty from board row 6: \"1 . A . . . . . . .\" so (1,6) is \".\" empty.\n- Risk: From (1,6), we have body below at (1,5) which is an apple but also will be occupied by our body after we move? Actually if we move RIGHT to (1,6), our body will shift: new tail will be at (0,4)? Wait our body currently: [(0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]? Wait from last turn: head (0,6), body: [(0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. Actually tail is (3,5) not (3,6). Let's re-read: \"Body: [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\" That's 6 body segments plus head = 7 total? Actually snake length = apples + 1 = 7. So head (0,6) + 6 body = total 7. Body list is tail to head? The description says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" Wait re-read: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): - Head: (0, 6) - Body: [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\" Actually that means head is (0,6), then next is (0,5), then (0,4), etc. So body order from head to tail: (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (3,5). That's 7 segments including head? Wait head is separate from body list. Actually body list excludes head? The description says \"Body: [...]\" and \"Head: (0,6)\". So body list is the segments after the head. So total segments = head + body = 1 + 6 = 7. That matches apples=6 + 1 = 7. Good.\n\nSo if we move RIGHT to (1,6), new head (1,6), body becomes old body shifted: new body = [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)], tail becomes (3,4). (1,5) will be empty? Actually (0,6) becomes body, (0,5) becomes body, etc. (1,5) remains empty. So moving RIGHT to (1,6) is safe.\n\nBut from (1,6), future options: UP to (1,7) empty, DOWN to (1,5) empty, LEFT back to (0,6) which will be occupied by our body? Actually after moving to (1,6), (0,6) becomes part of our body, so moving LEFT back into (0,6) would be hitting our own body. That's a trap! We'd be boxing ourselves in. That's bad.\n\n**COMPARING UP vs RIGHT:**\n- UP: (0,7) keeps us along the wall, maintains multiple escape routes: UP, RIGHT, even DOWN back to (0,6) which will be body? Actually after moving UP, (0,6) becomes body, so moving DOWN back into (0,6) would be suicide. But from (0,7), we have UP and RIGHT as safe forward moves. That's two options, better than one.\n- RIGHT: (1,6) gives us immediate proximity to the center but limits future movement because LEFT becomes deadly. Also, moving RIGHT brings us closer to enemy territory? Not really, but we might be moving toward apples faster. However, we're still at the edge of our body zone.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\nWe need to box the enemy in. The enemy is at (6,8) with body trailing down to (7,7). They're in the top-right quadrant. Our body forms a wall from (0,4) to (3,5) plus (0,5). We're on the left side. To box them in, we need to cut off their access to the top-right area. The best way is to get to the top row (y=9) and move right toward x=9, creating a horizontal barrier. Starting from (0,6), going UP gets us closer to the top quickly. Going RIGHT moves us laterally but not upward.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be moving DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8) or maybe UP? But UP is off board. They could go RIGHT to (7,8) but that's their own body? Actually their body is [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]? Wait from description: \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 8), Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7)]\" Actually head is (6,8), body includes (6,9) which is above the head? That seems odd. Maybe the body list is not in order? It says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" So for snake #0: head (6,8), body: [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]. That would mean (6,9) is connected to head (6,8) \u2013 that's upward. Then (7,9) is connected to (6,9) \u2013 right. Then (7,8) connected to (7,9) \u2013 down. Then (7,7) connected to (7,8) \u2013 down. So the snake is coiled in the top-right. That's weird but possible. So enemy head at (6,8), body segments: (6,9) above, (7,9) right-up, (7,8) right-down, (7,7) down. So they have a sort of loop.\n\nIf they move DOWN to (6,7), that's empty. They might do that to reach apple at (6,8)? Wait apple at (6,8) is occupied by their head? Actually board shows (6,8) as \"A\" in row 8? Let's check board: row 8: \". . . . . . A T . A\" means col6=A, col7=T, col8=., col9=A. So (6,8) is apple, (7,8) is T (their body), (9,8) is apple. So their head at (6,8) is on an apple! Did they just eat it? Possibly yes, and they grew. But we don't know if they ate this turn. We'll assume they might move off it.\n\nOur plan: Move UP to (0,7). Then next turn we can continue UP to (0,8) or (0,9), then start moving RIGHT. We want to get to (9,9) or (8,9) to cut off the top-right corner. Meanwhile, enemy might try to go left or down. We need to anticipate their moves and potentially force a head-on collision when we have the lead.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP is the play. It's safe, opens up the top corridor, and sets up our boxing strategy. Let's climb and conquer!\n\n**MOVE: UP**",

We need to keep our cool and set up the trap. Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OUR SNAKE:** Head at (0,7), body: [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4)]. We're a vertical wall on the left side, which is perfect. Our tail is at (3,4), so we have space to grow without backing into ourselves.\n\n**OPPONENT:** Snake #0 at (6,8) with body [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]. They're boxed in the top-right corner. Apples around: (9,8) and (9,7) are close to them, but they might be stuck.\n\n**BOARD STATE:** Row 7 is mostly clear. Row 8 has an apple at (9,8) and their body at (7,8). Row 9 has apples at (9,7) and (9,8)? Wait board shows row 9: \"T T . . . . . . T .\" so (7,9) and (8,9) are \"T\" (their body), (9,9) is \".\"? Actually col9 is \".\"? Let's read: \"9 . . . . . . T T . .\" so col0=\".\", col1=\".\", col2=\".\", col3=\".\", col4=\".\", col5=\".\", col6=\".\", col7=\"T\", col8=\"T\", col9=\".\" So (9,9) is empty. Good.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (0,7):**\n\n1. **UP to (0,8):**\n   - Safe? (0,8) is empty (row 8 col0 is \".\" from board). No own body, no enemy. \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Advantage: Climbs toward the top (y=9). From (0,8), we can go UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8). Both are empty (row 9 col0 is \".\" and row 8 col1 is \".\"). Keeps options wide open. Also gets us closer to forming a horizontal barrier across the top to cut off enemy escape. \ud83c\udfc6\n\n2. **DOWN to (0,6):**\n   - Would hit our own body! (0,6) is our first body segment. That's suicide. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n3. **LEFT to (-1,7):**\n   - Off board! Dead. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1,7):**\n   - Safe? (1,7) is empty (row 7 col1 is \".\" from board). \u2714\ufe0f\n   - But future risk: From (1,7), LEFT back to (0,7) would be moving into our own body (since (0,7) becomes part of our body after moving). That would trap us if we ever need to retreat. Also, (1,7) is moving toward the center, which might bring us closer to the enemy's potential path. However, it's not immediately dangerous. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nOur goal is to BOX THE ENEMY IN. They're already in the top-right corner with a body blocking their own paths. We need to secure the top row (y=9) to cut off their exit. Moving UP to (0,8) puts us on track to reach (0,9) next turn, then we can start moving RIGHT along y=9 toward x=9. That forms a horizontal wall. Meanwhile, enemy might try to go DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8) to escape, but our wall will compress them.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,7), we're moving laterally but not upward. That doesn't help our wall strategy. Also, if we go RIGHT, we might block our own future upward path (e.g., (1,8) might be safe but we'd be starting from a different axis).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy head is at (6,8). They might move DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), or RIGHT to (7,8) (but (7,8) is their body, so illegal). They could also move UP to (6,9) but that's their own body (6,9) is in their body list? Actually (6,9) is part of their body, so illegal. So they likely move DOWN or LEFT. We're far away, so no direct collision this turn.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP is the superior move. It's safe, keeps multiple options, and directly supports our boxing strategy. We need to claim the top-left corner and then sweep right. Let's climb and dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Reach (0,9) next turn, then head RIGHT along y=9. Force the enemy into a corner and crash them when we have the score lead.

Reason: preserves the most future options (you\u2019ll still have Up/Left/Right choices next turn, and moving to the left side gives better room to maneuver against the archrival later). It also keeps you away from the top edge trap potentials and lets you pivot toward apples without getting boxed in immediately.\n\nShort-term plan / strategy note:\n- Maintain two to three escape routes each turn; avoid giving Snake #1 a clean head-on by forcing him into the wall or into your own body chain later.\n- Gradually creep toward the left-middle zone to threaten a corridor squeeze and potential box maneuver if he ever comes your way.\n- Keep your head moving and don\u2019t chase apples at the expense of safety; once you build a stable chokepoint, you can pressure him more directly.\n- If you can secure a lead on apples later, flip to stronger crossing moves to force a head-on collision only if it benefits you.\n\nNext move: \nDOWN",

Tail is at (2,4), giving us space to grow.\n\n**OPPONENT:** Snake #0 at (5,7) with body [(5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9)]. They've moved DOWN slightly, but are still trapped in the top-right. Apples: (9,8) and (9,7) are close, but they might struggle to reach them.\n\n**BOARD STATE:** Row 8 col0 is empty (our current spot). Row 9 is open left side. Apple at (9,8) is right by their body but might be dangerous for them to grab.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (0,8):**\n\n1. **UP to (0,9):**\n   - Safe?

We'd be starting from (1,8) instead of (0,9), which is less strategic for boxing the enemy in. Also, (1,8) might be closer to enemy paths. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nOur goal remains to BOX THE ENEMY IN. They're confined to x=5-7, y=7-9. By moving UP to (0,9), we claim the top row's leftmost point. Next turn, we can head RIGHT along y=9, creating a horizontal wall that cuts off their escape upward. Meanwhile, they might try to go DOWN to (5,6) or LEFT to (4,7), but our wall will compress them further into the corner.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,8), we're delaying our wall construction. The enemy might find an escape route before we secure the top. We need to be aggressive and claim territory quickly!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy head is at (5,7). Possible moves: DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7) (safe), UP to (5,8) (their own body, illegal). They're unlikely to move UP into themselves. We're far away, so no direct collision threat this turn.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP is the clear winner.

Let's break it down!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OUR SNAKE:** Head at (0,9) after our last move UP. Body: [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)]. We're a vertical wall on the left side, now occupying the top-left corner. Tail is at (1,4), giving us space to grow. Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT:** Snake #0 at (5,6) with body [(5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9)]. They moved DOWN from (5,7) to (5,6). Still trapped in x=5-6, y=6-9. Apples: 4. They're getting squeezed!\n\n**BOARD STATE:** We're at (0,9). Apple at (8,0) is far but tempting. (9,5) and (9,2) are in the enemy's zone. (7,4) is reachable but risky. We need to stay aggressive!\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (0,9):**\n\n1. **UP to (0,10):** Off board! Dead. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0,8):**\n   - Safe? (0,8) is our own body! That's suicide. \u274c ELIMINATE. (We can't go back into ourselves.)\n\n3. **LEFT to (-1,9):** Off board! Dead. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1,9):**\n   - Safe? (1,9) is empty (row 9 col1 is \".\" from board). \u2714\ufe0f\n   - This moves us RIGHT along the top row. Perfect for building our horizontal wall! From here, we can continue RIGHT to (2,9), (3,9), etc., cutting off the enemy's escape upward. They're already confined; this wall will make their space even tighter.\n   - Advantages: \n     - Advances our boxing strategy (wall building).\n     - Keeps us safe from immediate collision (enemy is far away at (5,6)).\n     - Opens up future moves: from (1,9), we can go DOWN to (1,8) or continue RIGHT, keeping options open.\n     - Might allow us to grab an apple later (e.g., (9,8) or (9,7) if we can reach them safely, but we prioritize boxing over apples).\n   - Risk: None immediate. Enemy can't reach us this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nOur goal is to BOX THE ENEMY IN. They're at (5,6), head is down. They might try to go DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), or RIGHT to (6,6). By moving RIGHT to (1,9), we continue our wall along y=9. Next turn, we can push further RIGHT or start moving DOWN along x=1 to build a vertical wall, depending on their moves. We need to compress their space until they have no safe moves and crash. Remember: we're winning on apples, so if we can force a head-on collision, we win. But first, trap them!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy head at (5,6). Possible moves: DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6), UP to (5,7) (but that's into their own body, illegal). They're unlikely to move UP. We're far apart, so no collision threat. They might try to go for apples at (9,5) or (9,2), but our wall will block their path upward.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (1,9). Then, continue RIGHT along y=9 to (2,9), (3,9), etc., to form a complete horizontal barrier. After that, start moving DOWN along the right side of our wall to close the trap from below. Monitor enemy movements: if they go DOWN, we might need to adapt and move DOWN earlier to cut off their left escape. Stay aggressive, keep the pressure on, and don't let them breathe!\n\n**MOVE: RIGHT**",

Stay alive, widen lanes, and wait for the right moment to chase apples and nudge him into a trap.\n\nNext turn, if the board cooperates, we pivot to tighten space around his escape and look for a safe head-on only if we\u2019re ahead.\n\nLEFT",

Let's break it down!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OUR SNAKE:** Head is at (2,9) after our last move RIGHT. Body: [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4)]. We're building a horizontal wall along the top row! Tail is at (0,4), giving us space to grow. Apples: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT:** Snake #0 at (5,5) with body [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8)]. They moved DOWN from (5,6) to (5,5). Still trapped in x=5-6, y=5-8. Apples: 4. They're getting squeezed from BELOW now!\n\n**BOARD STATE:** We're at (2,9). Apple at (9,8) is directly ahead on the top row! (9,7) is just below it. We need to keep advancing our wall to cut off their escape upward.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (2,9):**\n\n1. **UP to (2,10):** Off board! Dead. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,8):**\n   - Safe? (2,8) is empty from board state (row 8 col2 is \".\"). \u2714\ufe0f\n   - BUT: This breaks our horizontal wall formation! We're at (2,9), and moving DOWN would leave the top row incomplete. The enemy is at y=5, so they're not threatening our top wall yet, but we need that barrier to trap them.\n   - Risk: Medium. We lose the aggressive push to build the wall.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,9):**\n   - Safe? (1,9) is our body! That's suicide. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,9):**\n   - Safe? (3,9) is empty (row 9 col3 is \".\" from board). \u2714\ufe0f\n   - This moves us RIGHT along the top row, continuing our horizontal wall! Perfect.\n   - From (3,9), we can keep going RIGHT to (4,9), (5,9), etc., building a complete barrier across the top. Once the wall is complete, we can start moving DOWN along the right side to close the trap from below.\n   - Advantages:\n     - Advances our boxing strategy (wall building).\n     - Keeps us safe from immediate collision (enemy is far at (5,5)).\n     - Opens up future moves: from (3,9), we can continue RIGHT or eventually DOWN, keeping options open.\n     - Gets us CLOSER to the apple at (9,8)! If we keep moving RIGHT each turn, we'll reach it soon (in 6 turns, but we'll have to watch out for the enemy).\n     - Forces the enemy into a smaller space: they're now at y=5, and our wall will block any upward escape.\n   - Risk: None immediate. Enemy can't reach us this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nOur goal is to BOX THE ENEMY IN. They're at (5,5), head is down. They might try to go DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), or RIGHT to (6,5). By moving RIGHT to (3,9), we continue our wall along y=9. Next turn, we'll keep pushing RIGHT to (4,9), (5,9), etc., until we hit x=9, forming a complete horizontal barrier. Then, we can start moving DOWN along x=9 to create a vertical wall on the right side, cutting off their escape to the apples on the right. Monitor enemy movements: if they go LEFT toward (4,5), we might need to adapt and move DOWN earlier to cut off that path. Stay aggressive, keep the pressure on, and don't let them breathe!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy head at (5,5). Possible moves: DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5), UP to (5,6) (but that's into their own body, illegal). They're unlikely to move UP. We're far apart, so no collision threat. They might try to go for apples at (9,5) or (7,4), but our wall will block their path upward and left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (3,9). Continue building the top wall to x=9. Then, turn DOWN along the right side to box them in from the south. Keep score pressure: we're ahead, so if we can force a head-on collision when they panic, we win. Stay alive, stay smart, and dominate!\n\n**MOVE: RIGHT**",

RIGHT to (5,5) is INTO OUR OWN BODY and is a no-go. \ud83e\udde0\n- WHY LEFT? It starts a controlled funnel toward the center-left, opening multiple escape routes and keeping us away from the edge traps. It also edges us toward the apple at (1,5) in a couple of moves if the path stays clear. We\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 6), so we want space and future options, not a risky head-on chase right now. \ud83d\udea6\n- WHAT TO WATCH: opponent is far up top-left; no immediate collision risk this turn. We\u2019ll avoid creating a direct head-on unless we gain a big positional or apple advantage soon. \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TLOTS (future self note):\n- Build a small funnel along y=5, x=3\u20134 area to limit their escape vectors if they get zoomy later.\n- Look for the safe apple routes (like drifting toward (1,5) or nearby apples) only when we have multiple escape lanes to avoid getting boxed in.\n- If an opportunity to force a head-on collision appears while we\u2019re ahead on apples, pounce; otherwise, play the long game: survive, expand control, and chase when the odds tilt in our favor.\n\nPUMPED, READY, LET'S GO: LEFT\nLEFT",

Let's analyze the new board.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OUR SNAKE:** Head is at (4,9) after our last move RIGHT. Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7)]. We are continuing our horizontal wall on the top row! Tail is at (0,7). Apples: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT:** Snake #0. Based on the board map, they are at (5,4) (the '0' is at row 4, col 5). Their body goes up to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Wait, the board map shows `.` at (5,5) now? Let me re-check the map.\nMap at row 5: `. A . T T T . . . A`\nT at (3,5), T at (4,5), T at (5,5)? No, the T's are the body segments? Actually, the board uses '1' for our head, '0' for enemy head, 'T' for body parts (either snake), 'A' for apples, '.' for empty.\nLooking at the opponent data: Head (3,4), Body [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)].\nWait, the board map shows:\nRow 4: `. . . 0 . . . A . .` -> Enemy head is at (3,4). Correct.\nRow 5: `. A . T T T . . . A` -> (3,5)=T, (4,5)=T, (5,5)=T. That matches their body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).\nRow 6: `. . A . . T . . . .` -> (5,6)=T. That matches their body (5,6).\nSo the enemy head is at (3,4) and body extends to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). Correct.\n\n**BOARD STATE:** I am at (4,9). Apple at (9,8) is still straight ahead! (9,7) is also an apple.\nEnemy is at (3,4). They are contained in a small area x=3 to 5, y=4 to 6.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (4,9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4,10):** Off board! Dead. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (4,8):** Safe? (4,8) is '.' on the map. It is not occupied by my body (my body is at x=0,1,2,3 on row 9, and (0,8), (0,7)). It is not occupied by enemy. \u2714\ufe0f\n3.  **LEFT to (3,9):** Safe? (3,9) is my body (first body segment). Dead. \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (5,9):** Safe? (5,9) is '.' on the map. It is not occupied. \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI need to continue building the wall to the right.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (5,9)**, I extend the wall. This is the best aggressive move to cut off the top.\nIf I go **DOWN to (4,8)**, I break the wall. While safe, it opens space above me (row 9 is still mostly open for the enemy if they somehow get there, but they are low). However, keeping the wall intact is crucial for the boxing strategy.\nThe apple at (9,8) is the prize. Moving RIGHT gets me closer. Distance to (9,8) is 4 moves (5->6->7->8->9).\nDistance to (7,4) apple is further and involves dropping down.\nLet's stick to the plan: Build the top wall, then drop down the right side.\nI will move **RIGHT** to (5,9).\n\n**RISKS:**\n*   **Head-on Collision:** Enemy is at (3,4). They can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They cannot move UP into (3,5) (their own body). They can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of these get them to (5,9). No collision risk.\n*   **Crashing into own body:** (5,9) is empty. Safe.\n*   **Crashing into enemy body:** Enemy body is far away (y=4-6). Safe.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMove RIGHT to continue the wall and chase the apple.\n\n**MOVE: RIGHT**",

It also preserves future retreat options if the top chase tightens.\n\nShort-term plan: Turn 24 = UP to (2,4). Turn 25 = UP to (2,5). Aim to eat at (2,6) (Turn 26) to push to 7 apples and widen the lead. If that apple timing shifts, adjust toward (1,5) or (2,1) as needed.\n\nLong-term strategy: Hatch a shallow left-side fence to corral him away from the top edge, threaten a controlled head-on only when I\u2019m up by at least 2 apples, and stay pliable to shifts in his path. Keep multiple safe follow-ups and avoid dead-ends.\n\nTurn-by-turn caution: Monitor his moves; don\u2019t cross his head or trap yourself in a tight pocket.

The tail is (2, 9).)\n- **Apples:** 6\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n- **Head:** (2, 5)\n- **Body:** [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n- **Apples:** 5\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (10x10):**\nI am at (8, 9). Top row. Top-Right corner is (9, 9).\nApple list: (9, 8) is RIGHT there! (9, 5) is also there. (8, 2) is further down.\nHowever, (9, 9) is currently empty (marked '.' in the board state).\nBUT WAIT! In the previous turn (Turn 25), I was at (7, 9). I moved RIGHT to (8, 9).\nThe board state provided shows `1` at (8, 9)? No, the board state shows `.` at (8, 9)?\nLet's look closely at the provided board state:\n`9 . . T T T T T T 1 .`\nCoordinates: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n`9` row: (0,9) `.`, (1,9) `.`, (2,9) `T`, (3,9) `T`, (4,9) `T`, (5,9) `T`, (6,9) `T`, (7,9) `T`, (8,9) `1`, (9,9) `.`.\nWait, the map shows `(8,9)` is `1` (My head) and `(9,9)` is `.`.\nBut the apple list includes `(9,8)`.\nLet's check the previous move rationale.\nI was at (7,9) at Turn 25.\nI moved RIGHT to (8,9).\nThe board state provided is the *current* board state for Turn 26.\nMy head is at (8,9).\nApple (9,8) is adjacent (RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT).\nApple (9,5) is adjacent (RIGHT then DOWN...).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** (8, 9).\n2.  **Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** (8, 10) -> Off board. DEAD.\n    *   **DOWN:** (8, 8). Let's check the board state.\n        *   Row 8: `. . . . . . . . . A` (from the map).\n        *   (8, 8) corresponds to the 9th element (index 8).\n        *   The map shows `(8,8)` is `.`.\n        *   Is it my body? My body is at [(7,9), (6,9)... (2,9)]. (8,8) is not in there.\n        *   Is it enemy? Snake #0 is at (2,5)... (3,5). Far away.\n        *   **Result:** SAFE.\n    *   **LEFT:** (7, 9).\n        *   My body is at (7, 9). (It's the neck).\n        *   Moving into own body = DEAD.\n        *   **Result:** KILL.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (9, 9).\n        *   Board state: (9, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   My body: Not there.\n        *   Enemy: Not there.\n        *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\n*   **Goal:** Dominate. Force collisions. Box him in.\n*   **Apple Focus:** There is an apple at (9, 8) and (9, 5).\n*   **Option 1: DOWN (to 8, 8)**\n    *   Path: (8,9) -> (8,8).\n    *   Next turn options: (8,7), (7,8), (9,8).\n    *   (9,8) is an apple. I can grab it next turn.\n    *   This keeps me slightly out of the immediate corner, maintaining flexibility.\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT (to 9, 9)**\n    *   Path: (8,9) -> (9,9).\n    *   Next turn options: (9,8) [APPLE], (8,9) [My tail moves away, so this is an option].\n    *   This moves me into the top-right corner.\n    *   **Risk:** Getting boxed in the corner.\n    *   **Reward:** I claim the corner. I am 1 step away from (9, 8) apple. I am also 1 step away from (9, 5) (via DOWN).\n\n**COMPARISON:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9), I am \"boxed in\" only if I cannot move DOWN or LEFT (which is blocked by my own body immediately, but by turn 27, my tail moves to (3,9)? No, tail is (2,9) currently).\nWait, my tail is at (2,9).\nAt Turn 26, I am at (8,9). My body connects to (7,9), (6,9)... (2,9).\nIf I move to (9,9), my new body list is [(8,9), (7,9)... (2,9)].\nAt Turn 27:\n- My tail (currently (2,9)) will move to (3,9) (unless I eat an apple, then it stays).\n- If I am at (9,9), I can move DOWN to (9,8) or LEFT to (8,9).\n- (8,9) will be occupied by my body (the neck) at the start of Turn 27. So LEFT is blocked.\n- However, at Turn 27, my neck is at (8,9). If I eat an apple at (9,8) on Turn 27, I grow. My tail stays at (2,9).\n- If I don't eat, my tail moves to (3,9).\n- Let's look at the move RIGHT now.\n    - (9,9) is a corner.\n    - Moving to (9,9) commits me to moving DOWN or LEFT next turn.\n    - LEFT is blocked by my neck (8,9).\n    - So I *must* go DOWN to (9,8).\n    - (9,8) is an apple. This is good!\n\n**REASONING FOR RIGHT:**\n1.  **Aggression:** Moving to the corner (9,9) maximizes board control. I am claiming the space.\n2.  **Apple Proximity:** From (9,9), I am adjacent to (9,8) which is an apple. From (8,8), I am *also* adjacent to (9,8). Both paths lead to the apple.\n3.  **The \"Wall\" Strategy:** I am currently building a vertical wall on the left (x=2 to x=7 on y=9). Moving to (9,9) extends this claim to the right edge.\n4.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (2,5). He is far away. He is not a threat to me right now.\n5.  **Safety:** (9,9) is safe. (8,8) is safe.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: DOWN to (8,8)**\n- This is a \"safe\" middle ground.\n- But (8,8) is not as strategically dominant as (9,9).\n- (9,9) forces me to commit to the edge, which is good for snake movement (fewer collision options for the enemy, fewer escape routes for him if we box him in later).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (9, 9).\nWhy?\n- It claims the corner.\n- It puts me in position to eat the apple at (9, 8) on the very next turn.\n- It is safe.\n- It looks cooler on stream.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (9, 8) next turn. Then sweep down the right side (x=9) to pick up (9, 5) or (9, 2). While doing this, keep an eye on Snake #0. If he drifts towards the center/right, I will cut him off.\n\n**MOVE:** RIGHT",

Now I'm at (9, 9) and looking to snowball this lead!\n\nLet's break down the board. I'm in the top-right corner.\n- **My position:** Head at (9, 9). Body follows down to (3, 9).\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #0 is at (2, 6). He's still way over on the left side. Not an immediate threat to my head.\n- **Board hazards:** My own body blocks (8, 9). The wall blocks (9, 10).\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES:**\n\n1.  **UP:** Impossible. I'd hit the ceiling and die. Instant loss. Don't throw the stream!\n2.  **LEFT:** (8, 9).\n    - Problem: My body is currently at (8, 9). It's my neck!\n    - Result: **DEAD.** Self-collision. Absolutely not.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Impossible. Off the board. Dead.\n4.  **DOWN:** (9, 8).\n    - **Check:** Is it an apple? YES! (9, 8) is marked 'A' in the list!\n    - **Check:** Is it my body? My body is at (8, 9), (7, 9)... (3, 9). (9, 8) is clear.\n    - **Check:** Is it enemy? Snake #0 is at (2, 6). Far away.\n    - **Result:** **SAFE.** And I eat an apple!\n\n**THE CALL:**\nThere is literally only one legal move that keeps me alive. I have to go DOWN. If I don't, I lose instantly. Plus, by going DOWN, I get to eat that delicious apple at (9, 8). This grows my snake, increases my score to 7, and keeps me in the game.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating at (9, 8), my tail will stay where it is (since I grew), but I need to watch out for my new body path. I'll be at (9, 8) with my tail still at (3, 9). Next turn, I'll likely want to continue down towards (9, 5) where another apple is waiting, or swing back to the left if the enemy gets too close. But right now, survival and growth is key.\n\nCHAT, LET'S EAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

I'm in a bit of a jam in the top-right corner.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZING MY CURRENT POSITION:**\n    *   Head: (9, 8)\n    *   Body: (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)\n    *   **UP to (9, 9):** Blocked by my own body. Instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **RIGHT to (10, 8):** Off the board. Instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 8):** Open space. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 7):** There's an apple 'A' there! Safe, and I can score again to extend my lead to 8-6.\n\n2.  **THE STRATEGY:**\n    *   If I go **DOWN to (9, 7)**, I eat the apple. That's +1 point (8-6). My tail stays at (3, 9) because I grew.\n    *   **Long-term trap:** Once I'm at (9, 7), I can keep spiraling down! I see another apple at (9, 5) and (9, 2). If I eat at (9, 7), I can go DOWN to (9, 6), then DOWN to (9, 5) for another apple. I can literally snake my way down the right wall, eating all the apples there, staying safe from the enemy who is all the way left. This boxes him out of the right side completely.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (8, 8), I'm safe, but I waste the apple right under me. I need to keep scoring to maintain the lead and grow. Size equals board control.\n\n3.  **ENEMY THREAT:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (1, 6). They are far away. They can't crash into me this turn.\n    *   Could they move into my path later? Possibly, but by staying on the right wall, I minimize angles of approach. I'm dominating the perimeter.\n\n**THE CALL:**\nI'm taking the apple at (9, 7). It's the only move that scores points and keeps my momentum going. I'm locking down the right side of the map. I'm growing. I'm winning.

A 2-point lead is huge for morale and safety.\n    *   Second, this positions me perfectly to drop down further to (9, 4), then (9, 3), and eat the apple at (9, 2) on the subsequent turn.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (8, 6) feels like a distraction. While there are apples in that column, the right edge is safer (fewer directions of attack) and my body is already blocking the top. I want to tighten the noose on the right side, not wander into the middle where I could get cut off.\n\n3.  **ENEMY THREAT:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (0, 5). He is deep in the bottom-left corner. He is NOT a threat this turn. He cannot reach me.\n    *   I need to maximize my score. Being aggressive means taking the apple that is literally *right under my nose*.\n\n**THE CALL:**\nI am moving **DOWN**. I eat the apple at (9, 5), extending my lead to 9-7.

We're at Turn 31 and the pressure is on! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the current board state after my DOWN move:\n- **My Position:** Head is now at **(9, 5)**. I just ate that apple! Score is now **9-7** in my favor. My body stretches up the right edge from (9, 6) to (4, 9).\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is at **(0, 6)**. He's still chilling in the bottom-left corner. His body blocks a chunk of the left wall, but he's far from me.\n- **Apple Situation:** I'm literally standing on (9, 5), which was just an apple spot. Now looking for the next target. There's an apple at **(9, 2)** directly below me on the wall. There's also an apple at **(7, 5)** to the left.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZING MOVES FROM (9, 5):**\n    *   **UP to (9, 6):** This is where my body just moved from. If I go up, I run straight into my own neck. That's a death sentence. \ud83d\udeab **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 5):** This space is currently OPEN. (There is an apple at (7, 5) I could aim for, but the path is tight).\n    *   **RIGHT to (10, 5):** Off the board. Death. \ud83d\udeab **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 4):** This space is currently OPEN. This keeps me glued to the right wall.\n\n2.  **STRATEGY - THE WALL OF DOOM:**\n    *   Staying on the edge is the safest play. It minimizes the directions I can be attacked from (I only have to watch Left, Up, and Down).\n    *   **Option: DOWN to (9, 4).** This positions me perfectly to grab the apple at **(9, 2)** in two turns (9,4 -> 9,3 -> Eat at 9,2). This is a safe, guaranteed growth path. My tail will eventually leave (4,9), opening up the top-right corner slightly, but I'll be lower down the wall.\n    *   **Option: LEFT to (8, 5).** This moves me inward toward the center. While I might grab the apple at (7, 5) quickly, I expose myself to more angles. The enemy is at (0,6). If he moves right aggressively, we could end up in a confrontation in the center. I don't want to risk a head-on collision unless I'm sure I have the score advantage and a clear shot. Currently, I'm at 9, he's at 7. A trade (double death) results in a draw or loss if we die simultaneously. I want to survive and win.\n\n3.  **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (0, 6). He has apples at (2,1), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0) nearby. He's likely to go DOWN or RIGHT. He isn't threatening me this turn.\n    *   However, if I go LEFT into the board, I make it easier for him to cut me off later.\n\n**THE CALL:**\nI'm sticking to the plan. **DOMINATE THE WALL.** Moving **DOWN** to (9, 4) is the play. It keeps my flank safe, sets up a guaranteed apple eat at (9, 2), and maintains my score lead. I'm playing the long game, chat! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nCHAT, LET'S KEEP THE PRESSURE ON!\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019ll hug the left edge to restrict options and look for a controlled setup later.\n\n- Safe moves: only UP.\n- Why not others: LEFT off-board, RIGHT and DOWN collide with our body.\n- General plan: stay on the edge, watch the opponent\u2019s path near the right side, and set up a boxed corridor when an opening appears. If we can force a head-on while we\u2019re ahead in apples, take it; otherwise preserve space and growth.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n- Stay along x=0, pushing upward gradually to keep a wide corridor.\n- Monitor Snake #1\u2019s head movements (near (9,5)) and avoid letting them funnel toward our flank.\n- Look for a moment to coax a head-on collision only if it\u2019s safe and favorable on apples.\n\nShort-term action: MOVE UP (to (0,7)) and keep the edge tight. \n\nUP",

Let's analyze the battlefield.\n\n**My Position (Snake 1):**\n- Head: (9, 4)\n- Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]\n- **Immediate Threat Assessment:** I am on the right wall at x=9.\n  - **UP to (9, 5):** I literally just came from here. That's my neck. If I go back, I die. **ELIMINATED.**\n  - **DOWN to (9, 3):** This is currently OPEN. It keeps me on the wall.\n  - **LEFT to (8, 4):** This is currently OPEN. It moves me into the interior.\n  - **RIGHT to (10, 4):** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**Opponent Assessment (Snake 0):**\n- Head: (0, 7)\n- Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4)]\n- **Movement Prediction:** Snake 0 is pinned against the left wall.\n  - **UP to (0, 8):** Open. Moves him deeper into the corner.\n  - **DOWN to (0, 6):** He just came from (0, 6)? Actually, looking at his body list, his head was at (0, 7), body starts at (0, 6). Wait, let's re-read the board state.\n  - *Correction:* His head is (0, 7). His body starts at (0, 6). If he moves DOWN to (0, 6), he hits his own body. **DEADLY.**\n  - **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Open. This is the most likely move for him to get into the board.\n  - **LEFT:** Off board. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Strategy & Threat Analysis:**\n1.  **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** Chat, we need to dominate the board. Staying on the wall is good, but if I stay on the extreme edge (x=9), I risk getting my tail cut off or limiting my own movement if he pushes up the center. However, moving LEFT to (8, 4) is risky. Why?\n    - If I go LEFT to (8, 4), I am moving AWAY from the apple at (9, 2).\n    - If I go LEFT, I open up the space to my right. But more importantly, I need to check if Snake 0 can intersect my path.\n    - Snake 0 is likely going RIGHT to (1, 7).\n    - Distance Check: Snake 0 at (0,7) -> (1,7). Me at (9,4).\n    - We are far apart. Head-on collision is not immediate.\n\n2.  **Apple Prioritization vs Board Control:**\n    - There is an apple at **(9, 2)** directly below me.\n    - To eat it, I must go DOWN twice: (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2).\n    - If I go LEFT now, I abandon the guaranteed apple on the wall. I'd have to maneuver back, which is inefficient.\n    - If I go DOWN now, I claim the path to that apple.\n\n3.  **The Trap:**\n    - My body is currently blocking the entire right column from y=5 to y=9.\n    - If I go DOWN to (9, 3), my tail will eventually leave (5,9), but the immediate danger is low.\n    - What if Snake 0 goes UP? He's trapped in the corner. If he goes UP, he limits his own future moves.\n    - What if Snake 0 goes RIGHT? He enters the board. He is at x=1, I am at x=9. We are on opposite sides. He can't reach me for many turns.\n\n**The Decision:**\nI have a 2-point lead (9 to 7). I should play safe to maintain the lead and grow.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 3) secures the next turn apple eat at (9, 2). This increases my lead to 10-7.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 4) is a defensive \"center\" move, but I lose the guaranteed apple. I'd have to hunt for (7, 5) or (5, 2), which requires crossing the board. That puts me in Snake 0's potential path.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo for the apple. Dominate the wall. Force Snake 0 to play catch-up. I will go **DOWN** to (9, 3), setting up the eat at (9, 2) next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Eat the apple at (9, 2) next turn. Then look to curve left around the bottom edge to sweep the apples at (5,0) and (4,0) while keeping my tail safe on the right wall.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We\u2019re behind on apples, so survival and space > reckless chase.  \nLong-term plan: push the wall up the left side, monitor the right side for openings, and only press for a head-on when it\u2019s clearly favorable on apples or forces a mistake.

We need to secure that apple at (9, 2) to extend the lead to 10-7 and dominate the wall.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position (Snake 1):** Head at (9, 3). Body occupies (9, 4) to (9, 9) and (8, 9) down to (6, 9).\n- **Available Moves:**\n    - **UP to (9, 4):** This is my neck (the very next segment of my body). Moving here is moving backwards into myself. **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    - **DOWN to (9, 2):** This is currently OPEN. There is an apple here! This is the prime target.\n    - **LEFT to (8, 3):** This is currently OPEN. It moves into the board.\n    - **RIGHT:** Off the board. **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n- **Opponent (Snake 0):** Head at (0, 8).\n    - If he goes UP to (0, 9), he's safe but stuck in the corner.\n    - If he goes DOWN to (0, 7), he hits his own body (neck at (0, 7) -> body at (0, 6)? Wait, let's check the list: Head (0, 8), Body: [(0, 7), ...]. So moving DOWN to (0, 7) is hitting his own neck. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    - If he goes RIGHT to (1, 8), he's safe.\n    - If he goes LEFT, off board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n- **Collision Check:**\n    - If he goes RIGHT (1, 8) and I go DOWN (9, 2): We are nowhere near each other. No collision.\n    - If I go DOWN, I am moving further away from him.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have a 2-point lead. We need to extend it. The apple at (9, 2) is free for the taking. It's on my current column, requiring a simple DOWN move.\nMoving LEFT to (8, 3) is safe, but it abandons the guaranteed apple on the wall and forces me to navigate the interior where Snake 0 might eventually wander. Staying on the wall is safer and more predictable for trapping him later.\nAlso, eating the apple grows my body. My tail is currently at (6, 9). Moving DOWN to (9, 2) shifts my head away from my tail, keeping me safe.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move **DOWN** to (9, 2) to eat the apple. Score becomes 10-7.\n2. Next turn, I'll be at (9, 2). My options will be (9, 1) (likely apple), (8, 2), or back to (9, 3). I'll likely curve left along the bottom row to sweep the apples at (5,0) and (4,0).\n3. Keep forcing Snake 0 to deal with his cramped space on the left.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo for the guaranteed points. Dominate the edge. Secure the lead.\n\nDOWN",

We need to keep it that way.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (9, 2)\n  - Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]\n  - Tail: (6, 9) - Note that this spot will be free next turn as I move.\n- **Opponent (Snake #0):**\n  - Head: (0, 9)\n  - Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)]\n  - **Threat Analysis:** He is trapped in the top-left corner. If he moves **UP** or **LEFT**, he dies immediately. His only safe moves are **DOWN** (hits his own neck at 0,8 -> **DEATH**) or **RIGHT** to (1, 9). Wait, let's check (1, 9).\n    - (1, 9) is currently marked as 'T' on the board (for enemy tail? No, board map shows 'T' where my body is, but looking at coordinates: my body is at (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9). (1,9) is empty.\n    - Actually, looking at the board visualization:\n      `9 0 . . . . . T T T T` -> (0,9) is head, (1,9) is empty, (2,9) is empty... up to (5,9) empty, then (6,9) to (9,9) are my body.\n    - So if he goes **RIGHT** to (1,9), he is safe.\n  - **Verdict:** He will likely go RIGHT to (1,9). He is 9 units away from me vertically. Safe for now.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP (9, 3):**\n    - Target is (9, 3). This is currently my neck (the first segment of my body).\n    - Moving here means moving backwards into myself.\n    - **RESULT: IMMEDIATE DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **DOWN (9, 1):**\n    - Target is (9, 1). Is it safe?\n    - Board shows: `2 . . . . . A A . A 1` (row 2). Below that:\n      `1 . . A . A . . . . .` (row 1).\n    - (9, 1) is clear ('.'). No apple, but no snake bodies.\n    - **RESULT: SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 2):**\n    - Target is (8, 2).\n    - Board row 2 shows: `2 . . . . . A A . A 1`. (8, 2) is the cell before the '1' (which is at 9,2).\n    - (8, 2) contains an Apple! (Indicated by the 'A' at that position in the grid).\n    - **RESULT: SAFE + APPLE (+1 Score).**\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 2):**\n    - Target is off the board (x=10).\n    - **RESULT: DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n- We have two safe moves: **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n- **DOWN (9, 1)** moves me further down the wall. It doesn't get an apple immediately, but it opens up the bottom row (y=0) for the next turn.\n- **LEFT (8, 2)** gets an apple immediately! Score becomes 11-7.\n- **Aggression Check:** We are leading 10-7. Taking the apple at (8, 2) extends the lead to 11-7.\n- **Survival Check:**\n  - If I go **LEFT** to (8, 2): I eat the apple. My tail (6, 9) will shift, leaving (6, 9) empty next turn.\n  - The opponent is at (0, 9) moving to (1, 9). We are on opposite sides of the board.\n  - Is (8, 2) a trap? My body is currently to the right (9, 2) and above (9, 3...). Going left to (8, 2) moves me into the interior, away from my body wall. This is good. It keeps my tail growing and moves me closer to the cluster of apples at the bottom left (5,0), (4,0), etc.\n  - Crucially, by moving **LEFT**, I am moving *away* from my own body (which is to my right and above).\n- **Why not DOWN?** Down is safe, but it's a \"waiting\" move. Left is an \"attacking\" move. It grabs points and positions me to control the bottom row next.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nEat the apple at (8, 2). This boosts us to 11-7. From (8, 2), my next move options will likely be:\n- **LEFT (7, 2):** Towards the apple cluster.\n- **DOWN (8, 1):** Towards the bottom row.\n- **UP (8, 3):** Checking safety.\n- **RIGHT (9, 2):** My old spot, now safe (tail moved).\nBy taking (8, 2), I force the opponent to run for his life on the left while I sweep the apples on the bottom/right.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nAggression pays off. Secure the apple at (8, 2). Extend the lead. Dominate the board.\n\nLEFT",

The only safe move is RIGHT because:\n- UP would be off the board (0,10) and die.\n- DOWN would slam into our own neck at (0,8).\n- LEFT would bop us into the wall.\n\nSafe move: RIGHT to (1,9). No enemy body there, no apple snag this turn either, so we\u2019ll stay lean and keep options open.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN AND RATIONALE\n- We\u2019re playing defense with intent to outlive and outmaneuver, not sprint for apples yet. The top-left corridor (our current path) is fragile, so we\u2019ll hug the edge safely and look for a moment to pressure or bait a head-on when we have a better score or a clearer box setup.\n- By stepping to (1,9), we maintain a slim but flexible spine along the top row. From here, we can either pivot to (2,9) to creep rightward, or drop to (1,8) if the coast looks clear, keeping multiple escape routes open.\n- Opponent watch: Snake #1 is deep on the right side. Direct confrontation this turn would be risky given our score deficit. We\u2019ll avoid line-of-sight clashes for now and opportunistically trap or collide when the math tilts in our favor (more apples, more control, fewer bodies in the way).\n- Safety first, aggression second: survive this turn, then push for space, then pressure when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nTurn-by-turn vibe: stay alive, don\u2019t box yourself in, and keep the door open for a strategic squeeze later. If they dive into your area, we adapt; if they chase alone, we keep distance and look for a midpoint ambush.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down the board state and plan this move.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (8, 2) (I just ate that apple, nice!)\n  - Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 9)] (Wait, the tail was (6,9), after eating it didn't move, so tail is still (6,9) for this turn's movement decision. Actually, the body list shows the current state. The tail is the last element (6,9). After I move, the tail (6,9) will vacate.)\n  - Current position: (8, 2). Body is to my right (9, 2) and above/below/wall.\n- **Opponent (Snake #0):**\n  - Head: (1, 9) (Likely moved right from (0,9) as predicted)\n  - Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)?] (Need to infer from board).\n  - Board shows Row 9: `0 . . . . . T T T T`. (0,9) is head, (1,9) is empty (wait, he moved there, so it's occupied by his head). The board visualization shows '0' at (0,9) but logic says he moved to (1,9). The board shows 'T's for my body. (1,9) is likely empty in the visualization due to update lag or simply being empty space.\n  - Key threat: He is moving. If he moves right, he stays on the top row. If he moves down, he enters row 8.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\nCurrent Head: (8, 2).\n1.  **UP (8, 3):**\n    - Target: (8, 3).\n    - Board: Row 3 is mostly empty. `3 . . . . . . . . . T`.\n    - Is it safe? Yes, no bodies or walls.\n    - Is it smart? (8, 3) is safe, but it moves me up away from the bottom apple cluster. I'm currently at (8,2), which is surrounded by apples at (7,2), (8,1), (9,2 (old body)). Moving up is neutral.\n\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):**\n    - Target: (8, 1).\n    - Board: Row 1 is `1 . . A . A . . . .`. (8, 1) is empty ('.').\n    - Is it safe? Yes.\n    - Is it smart? Yes! It moves me towards the apple at (8,0) or (7,0) or (5,0). I am chasing the bottom row.\n\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):**\n    - Target: (7, 2).\n    - Board: Row 2 is `2 . . . . . A A . A 1` (Wait, row 2 is y=2). (7, 2) is an Apple! (A at index 7).\n    - Is it safe? Yes.\n    - Is it smart? YES! Aggressive play. Eating another apple increases lead to 12-7. It moves me further into the board to sweep apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):**\n    - Target: (9, 2).\n    - Is it safe? **NO.** This is my current neck/old body position. Moving back into yourself = DEATH.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nEliminate **RIGHT** (suicide).\n- **UP** is safe but passive.\n- **DOWN** is safe and positions for bottom row control.\n- **LEFT** is safe, gets an apple, and positions for further aggression.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWe are up 11-7. We need to keep pressure on. The opponent is on the far left. If we take **LEFT**, we eat the apple at (7,2). This puts us at (7,2) with a longer body.\nIf we go **DOWN**, we go to (8,1).\nComparing (7,2) vs (8,1): (7,2) is an apple. (8,1) is an empty space.\nI should take the guaranteed point. The opponent is far away and currently trapped in the top-left corner (trying to navigate around the wall/my body). He is not an immediate threat to my position at (7,2).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7,2). Then, from (7,2), I will look to sweep the bottom left cluster (5,2, 5,0, 4,0, etc.). I need to avoid getting trapped by my own body as I grow. Since my tail is at (6,9) and won't move until I eat, my body is effectively a wall on the right side. Staying on the left/center is safer than pushing too hard right.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo **LEFT**. Eat the apple. Extend the lead.\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re in a tight position but we\u2019re still alive and hunting the edge.\n\nCURRENT SITUATION\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID 0): Head (1,9); Body [(0,9),(0,8),(0,7),(0,6),(0,5),(1,5),(1,6)]\n- OPPONENT: Head (8,2); Body [(9,2),(9,3),(9,4),(9,5),(9,6),(9,7),(9,8),(9,9),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9)]\n- Apples: 7 for you, 11 for them. We\u2019re behind, so we need positional pressure plus safe growth when possible.\n- Board danger: Moving into your own neck or off the board is a death, and a head-on with their head is a mutual KO only if they collide.\n\nDIRECTIONS EVALUATION\n- UP: off the board (dead). Not an option.\n- DOWN: safe. Moves to (1,8); keeps multiple escape routes and avoids boxing ourselves in near the top edge.\n- LEFT: would smash into your neck at (0,9) on this turn (dead). Not an option.\n- RIGHT: safe. Moves to (2,9), but it tightens the top-row corridor and can limit future options, giving the opponent more room to maneuver toward a trap or a chase.\n\nDECISION\nWe pick DOWN. It preserves flexibility, avoids a premature top-edge box, and lets us probe the interior while we bide time to maneuver for a smarter trap later. It also keeps us away from the immediate apple clusters on the bottom row for now, reducing risk of accidental overextension.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move to (1,8) this turn.\n- From (1,8), keep options open: dip toward (2,8) for a quick cross-check, or drop to (1,7) if the coast is clean.\n- Watch Snake #1\u2019s path: they\u2019re stacked along the right/top edges; we\u2019re aiming to outlive and pivot into a squeeze when we can force a head-on or cutoff without trading ourselves for nothing.\n- Grow when safe but don\u2019t chase risk; prioritize survival while weaving toward future trapping opportunities.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\n2.  **EVALUATE SURVIVAL & AGGRESSION:**\n    *   **UP (7, 3):** Safe, but moves me towards my own body wall on the right (T's at col 9). Doesn't grab an apple immediately. Passive.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe, moves towards the bottom-left apple cluster. Good positioning.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 2):** **CRITICAL MOVE.** I see an apple at (6, 2). Eating this extends my lead to 12-7.\n        *   *Enemy Check:* Enemy is at (1, 8). He is far away. He cannot intercept me at (6, 2) this turn.\n        *   *Body Check:* My tail is at (7, 9). Moving left to (6, 2) does not hit my body.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   The opponent is stuck in the top-left corner (Snake #0). They are navigating the wall and my body.\n    *   I am at the center-right (7, 2). I have access to the bottom center apples and the left side.\n    *   Eating the apple at (6, 2) pulls me left, into the center of the board, opening up options to sweep the bottom row next.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I miss the apple. If I go UP, I'm just moving up.\n    *   Aggression means taking the apple. **LEFT** is the apple pick.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (6, 2). Once at (6, 2), I will have a clear path to sweep the bottom-left apples (5, 2, 4, 1, etc.) or cycle back up the right side. I need to keep the opponent boxed in the top-left. Do not let them breathe.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo **LEFT**. Eat the apple. Extend the lead. Dominate.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 1):** Board shows empty (`. `). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 2):** Board shows an **Apple** `A`. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 2):** This is my current neck/body! I cannot move back into myself. **DEATH.**\n\n2.  **EVALUATE SURVIVAL & AGGRESSION:**\n    *   **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 is at (2, 8). They are still boxed in the top-left. They are not a threat to me directly right now, but I need to keep pressure on to prevent them from breaking out and farming the apples on the left side (like (2, 1) or (0, 4)).\n    *   **My Score:** 12. Enemy Score: 7. I have a solid lead.\n    *   **Option LEFT (5, 2):** There is an apple here. Eating it extends my lead to 13-7. It also moves me closer to the center and the bottom-left apple cluster (4, 1), (3, 0), (2, 1). This is high-value content.\n    *   **Option UP (6, 3):** Safe, but empty. Moves me away from the bottom apples. Passive.\n    *   **Option DOWN (6, 1):** Safe, empty. Moves me toward the bottom, but I miss the apple at (5, 2). Why walk past food?\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   Aggression dictates eating the apple. While the enemy is trapped, I should secure resources.\n    *   Moving to (5, 2) opens up paths to (4, 1) or (4, 2) next turn. I need to sweep the bottom area to clean up the apples before the enemy inevitably dies or finds a way out.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I get the apple and position myself centrally. This is the winning play.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (5, 2) to extend the lead to 13-7. From there, head toward (4, 1) or clear the bottom row. Keep the enemy pinned in the corner. If they move towards an apple I want, I will intercept.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo **LEFT**. Eat the apple. Dominate.\n\nLEFT",

For now, keep distance and expand the board dominance.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next several turns):\n- Push toward the central corridor (roughly x=3\u20135, y=4\u20136) to canalize the opponent and recreate cages.\n- Use our tail and body angles to limit the enemy\u2019s safe entry points, forcing him into mistake or into a controlled collision if he overextends.\n- Stay away from hard corners; keep options open to pivot and re-adapt to his path.\n\nPlanned move for this turn: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Moves me toward the cluster of apples at (4, 1), (3, 0), and (2, 1).\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   **Aggression & Efficiency:** We want to clean up the bottom-left area before the enemy finds a way out. The apples at (5, 0), (4, 1), (3, 0), and (2, 1) are ripe for the taking.\n    *   **Pathing:** Going **DOWN** to (5, 1) positions us perfectly to eat (5, 0) next turn. If we go LEFT to (4, 2), we can eat (4, 1) or (3, 0) next turn. Both paths are valid.\n    *   **Safety:** Moving DOWN keeps us slightly further away from the enemy's potential breakout zone (top-left). It also clears the bottom row, which is a common escape route.\n    *   **The Play:** Going **DOWN** is the move. It sets up an immediate apple pickup at (5, 0) next turn and keeps us centrally located to pivot to the left cluster afterwards. We are securing the bottom first.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the bottom row apples ((5, 0) next turn, then sweep left). Keep the enemy pinned. If they move towards us, we cut them off. We are the predator, they are the prey.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo **DOWN**. Claim the bottom territory. Dominate.\n\nDOWN",

PRESSURE AND SURVIVAL >> APPLE COUNT\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN:\n- UP to (3, 9) \u2013 safe, keeps top-center access\n- DOWN to (3, 7) \u2013 safe, moves toward center\n- RIGHT to (4, 8) \u2013 safe, moves toward central canal\n- LEFT to (2, 8) \u2013 illegal (runs into your neck)\n\nSTRATEGY INSIGHT:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 13) but the play style is to pressure the center and trap, not chase hard. By nudging into the central corridor (x ~ 3\u20135, y ~ 4\u20136), we canalize the opponent away from edge chaos and keep multiple escape routes.\n- Avoid edge traps for now; keep space to slip away if the right-edge loop tries to crash the party. If a clean head-on opportunity arises when we\u2019re ahead, we can take it, but not at the expense of our life.\n- Our aim is to squeeze the opponent into tighter spaces using body geometry and corner awareness, then force a controlled collision or force him into a risky overreach.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\n- Step into the central corridor around x=3\u20135, y=4\u20136 over the next few turns to seal off the right-edge loop and reduce his safe entry points.\n- Use our tail and body angles to create a shallow trap corridor where he must commit, then cut off his options with a quick pivot.\n- Maintain at least two safe follow-up moves after each turn to dodge any sudden chases from his loop; avoid tight dead-ends that could pin us against the border.\n- If we gain a lead in apples or space, look for a controlled head-on only when both paths are clear and the risk is minimal.\n\nPlanned move for this turn: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

They are still navigating the top-left maze. They are *not* a threat to us this turn.\n    *   **My Score:** 13. Enemy Score: 7. We are dominating.\n    *   **Option DOWN (5, 0):** Safe. Gets us an apple.\n    *   **Option LEFT (4, 1):** Safe. Gets us an apple.\n    *   **Option RIGHT (6, 1):** Safe. Gets us an apple.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   We have three safe moves that lead to apples. This is a luxury.\n    *   **Left (4, 1)** is the best strategic move. Why? It positions us directly adjacent to the apple cluster at (3, 0), (2, 1), and (4, 0). If we go Left, we can pivot to (3, 0) or (4, 0) next turn.\n    *   If we go Right to (6, 1), we are moving away from the dense apple cluster and closer to the dangerous empty space on the right side of the board. We don't want to get drawn out there yet.\n    *   If we go Down to (5, 0), we eat the apple but trap ourselves slightly; we would have to turn Left or Right immediately after.\n\n    *   **The Play:** We go **LEFT**. We eat the apple at (4, 1), secure the bottom-left corner, and prepare to sweep up the remaining apples in that sector (3, 0) and (2, 1). We are cutting off the enemy's potential escape route downwards.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the bottom-left cluster (3, 0) and (2, 1) next. Continue to dominate the lower half of the board. Keep the enemy contained in the top-left quadrant. If they move down, we cut them off.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nGo **LEFT**. Claim the apple. Dominate the corner.\n\nLEFT",

Nice.\n    *   **UP (4, 2):** Leads to an empty space. While safe, it moves us slightly away from the dense apple cluster in the bottom-left corner (at 3,0; 2,1; 4,0). We want to dominate that area before the enemy has a chance to dream about it.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 0):** Eats an apple. Good. But it puts us right at the bottom edge. While the board shows an apple at (5,0), moving there later would trap us against the wall if we aren't careful. We want to keep options open.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 1):** Eats an apple. This is the power move. Why?\n        *   It connects us directly to the apple at (2, 1).\n        *   It sets us up to grab the apple at (3, 0) or (4, 0) next turn.\n        *   It keeps us central to the lower half of the board.\n        *   It keeps us away from the immediate wall, giving us more freedom of movement.\n\n4.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   We are ahead 14-7. We do not need to rush recklessly. We need to secure resources and maintain board control.\n    *   The enemy is stuck. If we sweep the bottom-left apples, we extend our lead further and deny them any future expansion route downwards.\n    *   **The Play:** Go **LEFT**. Eat the apple at (3, 1). Set up a chain reaction of apple consumption in the corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (3, 1) now. Next turn, pivot to (2, 1) or (3, 0). Clear out the bottom-left quadrant entirely. Keep the enemy contained in the top-left. If they try to drop down the middle (x=4 or x=5), we cut them off with our length.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nSecure the apple, control the corner, keep the lead. **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

He's moved down from (4, 7).\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (3, 2):** Checking the board map...

However, this puts us at (3, 0). Next turn, our options would be limited to (2, 0) or (4, 0), and potentially (3, 1) (which is our current body). (2, 0) is an apple, (4, 0) is an apple. It's safe, but it's a tight squeeze against the bottom wall.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1):** Eats an apple. This moves us to (2, 1). From here, we have more options: (1, 1) (empty), (2, 0) (apple), (2, 2) (empty), or (3, 1) (current body). This keeps us central and avoids the wall.\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   The enemy is at (3, 7). He wants to drop down to eat apples in the center (like (3, 5) or (4, 5)) or sweep the bottom-left.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3, 0), I'm exposing my flank to the bottom wall. If the enemy heads down the x=3 column, we could collide head-on if I move back up later.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2, 1), I secure an apple and position myself to take the corner. The enemy is still at x=3, so I'm moving away from his immediate vertical path.\n    *   **The Play:** Go **LEFT**. Eat the apple at (2, 1). This keeps us mobile, secures a point, and prepares us to clear the bottom-left quadrant safely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (2, 1). Next turn, pivot to (2, 0) or (1, 1) depending on the enemy's movement. We want to clear the bottom-left apples (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0) while keeping the enemy confined to the top/middle.

The enemy is at (3, 6) and looking to drop down into the center to eat those apples at (3, 5) and (4, 5). If he does that, he grows and gains momentum. We need to cut him off and box him in. My head is at (2, 1), and I just ate the apple there. Now I need to pick the perfect move to control the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   **My Head:** (2, 1)\n    *   **My Body:** [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (3, 6)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9)]\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (2, 2):** Board shows 'T' (Tree/Obstacle). **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **DOWN (2, 0):** Board shows an 'A' (Apple). **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 1):** Board shows empty ('.'). **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 1):** This is my body! I cannot go back into myself. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**\n    *   **DOWN (2, 0):** Eats an apple. However, this positions my head at (2, 0), the bottom-left corner. From there, my only future moves are (1, 0) or (3, 0). This is a \"dead end\" zone. While safe for now, it limits my ability to cut off the enemy in the center later. I'd be stuck in the corner while he takes the middle.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 1):** Moves to an empty cell. This is a strategic pivot. It moves me away from the immediate apple but keeps me in a position where I can control the left side and the bottom row.\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   **The Threat:** The enemy is at (3, 6). He has a clear path down the x=3 column to (3, 5) (Apple), (3, 4) (Empty), (3, 3) (Empty), (3, 2) (Tree), (3, 1) (My Body), (3, 0) (Apple). If he goes DOWN next turn, he eats at (3, 5) and grows.\n    *   **The Counter-Play:** If I go **LEFT** to (1, 1), I am *not* taking the immediate apple at (2, 0). BUT, I am positioning myself to intercept the enemy if he tries to sweep the bottom row later. More importantly, I am keeping my movement options open. From (1, 1), I can go to (0, 1), (1, 0), or (1, 2). (1, 0) is an Apple. (0, 1) is empty. (1, 2) is empty.\n    *   **The Trap:** By moving **LEFT**, I am telling the enemy: \"The bottom left is mine.\" If he wants to go for the apples at (3, 0) or (4, 0), he has to come down the middle, where my long body is already waiting. I am effectively boxing him in by taking the perimeter while my body blocks the center-right.\n    *   **Why NOT Down?** Going DOWN to (2, 0) feels like I'm giving up the center. I'd be trapped in the corner, and the enemy could easily cut me off or force a head-on collision later when I try to climb out.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nI'm choosing **LEFT**. It's the strategic move. I'm sacrificing a guaranteed apple this turn to maintain board control and keep my escape routes open. I'm forcing the enemy to either challenge my body or stay in the top half. Let's box him in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 42: Move LEFT to (1, 1). Turn 43: Pivot to (1, 0) to eat the apple there and secure the corner. Continue controlling the left side of the board to prevent the enemy from gaining any ground. Keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

He's marching down the middle column trying to get to the bottom row apples. My head is at (1, 1). I need to cut him off before he gets to (3, 0) and (4, 0).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   **My Head:** (1, 1)\n    *   **My Body:** [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (3, 4) (Just moved down from 3,5)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9)]\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (1, 2):** Board shows '.'

(Empty). **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 1):** This is my body! **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (1, 2):** Moves me to (1, 2). The board shows 'T' (Tree) at (1, 3) and 'T' at (2, 2). This is a trap! If I go UP, I'm putting my head in a small gap between the tree at (1, 3) and my body at (2, 1). I'd have very limited options next turn (only Left to 0,2 or Down to 1,1 which is my tail but would be occupied). **Avoid.**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 1):** Moves me to the edge of the board. From there, I can go Up to (0,2) or Down to (0,0). It's safe, but I'm moving away from the enemy and the central apples.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 0):** Moves me to (1, 0) and eats an apple! +1 Score (17-8). This positions me perfectly to control the bottom row. From (1, 0), I can move RIGHT to (2, 0) (Apple) or LEFT to (0, 0) (Empty). This keeps me mobile and aggressive.\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   **The Threat:** The enemy is at (3, 4). He wants to go DOWN to (3, 3), then (3, 2), then (3, 1) or (3, 0). (3, 1) is my body, so he can't go there. He is forced to go to (3, 0) or (4, 0).\n    *   **The Counter-Play:** If I go **DOWN** to (1, 0), I secure the apple there. More importantly, I am positioning myself to intercept him at (3, 0) or (4, 0) next turn. If he goes DOWN to (3, 3) this turn, I can move RIGHT to (2, 0) next turn, threatening to block him.\n    *   **Why NOT Left or Up?** Moving LEFT or UP takes me away from the action. The enemy is coming down the middle, and I need to hold the bottom row. If I retreat to the left edge, he gets free reign over the bottom-right apples. If I go UP into the corner, I trap myself.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nI'm choosing **DOWN**. I'm grabbing the apple at (1, 0) to extend my lead to 17-8. I am moving my head to the bottom row to physically block the enemy's path to the remaining apples in the bottom-left quadrant. I am forcing him to engage with my body or starve.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 43: Move DOWN to (1, 0) and eat the apple. Turn 44: Move RIGHT to (2, 0) to eat another apple and prepare to head-on collision or block the enemy if he tries to come down the x=3 column. I will own the bottom row.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy did not eat this turn, still 8 apples. I need to secure the bottom row and prepare to block the enemy's path to the bottom-left apples.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   **My Head:** (1, 0)\n    *   **My Body:** Starts at (1, 1) down to (9, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (2, 5)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** ((3,5)...) No overlap with my moves.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (1, 1):** This is my body! **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **DOWN (1, -1):** Off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **LEFT (0, 0):** Board shows 'A'. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** Board shows 'A'. **Safe.**\n\n3.  **EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 0):** Eats the apple at (0,0). Expands my score to 18-8. Moves me to the edge. From (0,0), future moves are restricted (Right to (1,0) or Up to (0,1)). (0,1) is empty. (1,0) will be my tail (safe to move back onto later? No, head moves into tail cell while tail moves away? Actually, if I go Left, my tail moves from (9,8) to (9,7). The cell (1,0) becomes empty. So I could move back to (1,0) later).\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** Eats the apple at (2,0). Expands score to 18-8. Moves me toward the center. From (2,0), I have more options: Up (2,1), Left (1,0), Right (3,0). (2,1) is empty (my body is at (1,1) and (2,1) is currently empty? Wait, my body is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)... oh wait. Let me check my body list.\n        *   My Body: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)...\n        *   So (2, 1) IS my body.\n        *   (3, 0) is an apple (from the list: (3,0) is in the list? Apple drops: (3,0) is there).\n        *   (1, 0) is the current head position, will become empty.\n        *   So from (2, 0):\n            *   Up (2, 1) -> **DEATH** (Body).\n            *   Left (1, 0) -> **Safe** (Empty).\n            *   Right (3, 0) -> **Safe** (Apple).\n            *   Down -> **Death** (Off board).\n        *   So from (2, 0), I have 2 safe moves (Left, Right).\n    *   From (0, 0):\n        *   Up (0, 1) -> **Safe** (Empty).\n        *   Right (1, 0) -> **Safe** (Empty).\n        *   Down -> **Death**.\n        *   Left -> **Death**.\n        *   So from (0, 0), I have 2 safe moves (Up, Right).\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   **The Threat:** Enemy is at (2, 5). He wants to go DOWN to (2, 4) or (2, 3)... wait, (2, 4) is an apple (Apple drops: (2,4)? No, list has (2,4) is not there. Apple drops: (8,0), (7,4), (7,0)... wait, looking at the board state image: (2,4) is 'A'.\n    *   Board State row 4: `A . A . . . . A . T` -> (0,4) 'A', (2,4) 'A'.\n    *   So enemy at (2,5) likely goes DOWN to (2,4) for the apple.\n    *   **The Counter-Play:** I want to move RIGHT to (2, 0). This positions me to eventually intercept him or dominate the bottom row.\n    *   Why RIGHT over LEFT?\n        *   Moving LEFT to (0,0) puts me in the corner. While safe, it's passive. The action is in the center/bottom-right.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (2,0) puts me on another apple and keeps me in the game. I can then move to (3,0) next turn if safe, or back to (1,0).\n        *   Also, if I go RIGHT, I am at (2,0). The enemy is at (2,5). If the enemy keeps moving down the x=2 column, we will eventually collide if I stay on x=2. But I can move off it.\n        *   However, I am currently 17-8. The enemy is 8 apples. I have a massive lead. I should play aggressively to secure the win.\n        *   Moving RIGHT gives me access to (3,0) and (4,0) apples.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0,0), I am stuck in the corner until I go Up. (0,1) is safe, but then I am on the left wall.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **RIGHT (2, 0):** +1 Score (18-8). Options: Left (1,0), Right (3,0). (3,0) is an apple.\n        *   **LEFT (0, 0):** +1 Score (18-8). Options: Up (0,1), Right (1,0).\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will choose **RIGHT**. Why? Because it keeps me more central and aggressive. If I go to (2,0), I threaten the apple at (3,0). The enemy is at (2,5). If he goes down, he might not reach the bottom apples if I take them first. I have the speed (I eat apples, he might not immediately). I have the lead. I want to box him in. By moving right, I am physically closer to the bottom-center apples (3,0), (4,0), (5,0). Moving left pushes me away.\n\n5.  **FINAL PLAN:**\n    Move **RIGHT** to (2, 0). Eat apple. 18-8. Prepare to move to (3, 0) next turn to secure more apples and block the enemy from coming down the right side of the bottom-left quadrant. If the enemy drops down to (2,4), he is still far away. I own the bottom.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (2,4) gives us an immediate apple and drops us into a vertical stance on the left side that can pressure Snake #1 later.

I need to be aggressive to finish this game.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZE CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   My Head: (2, 0)\n    *   Enemy Head: (2, 4) (He's directly above me!)\n    *   Board: Row 0 has apples at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0). I am at (2,0). The immediate right (3,0) is an apple. Left (1,0) is empty.\n    *   Enemy Body: Starts at (2, 5) and goes to (1, 8). This creates a vertical wall at x=2 from y=5 upwards.\n    *   My Body: My tail is way back at (9,7). I have a massive open space behind me to the right and up.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:**\n    *   **UP (2, 1):** Check board state. Row 1 shows `. T T T T T . . . .` -> (2, 1) is a 'T' (my own body). **DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN (2, -1):** Off the board. **DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 0):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 0):** Apple. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **EVALUATE SAFE MOVES & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   **Scenario A: I move LEFT to (1, 0).**\n        *   I am safe. I don't eat an apple.\n        *   Enemy is at (2, 4). Where does he go?\n            *   He wants apples. Apple at (3, 4)? No. (2, 3)? No.\n            *   He might chase the apple at (2, 2)? No, that's empty.\n            *   He might chase (3, 3)? No.\n            *   Actually, look at the board. The enemy is trapped between my vertical body at x=2 (y=5+) and the left wall.\n            *   If I move LEFT to (1, 0), I am effectively stepping out of his immediate vertical line.\n            *   BUT, if I move LEFT, I am NOT growing. I am stalling.\n            *   If I move LEFT, and Enemy moves DOWN to (2, 3) or (2, 2), he gets closer to the bottom apples.\n    *   **Scenario B: I move RIGHT to (3, 0).**\n        *   I eat an apple! Score 17-9 (I grow). Wait, my score is 16, so I go to 17. Enemy is 9.\n        *   My body grows. My tail moves from (9,7) to (9,6)? No, since I eat, tail stays for one turn. (Actually, if I eat, the tail doesn't move this turn? No, in standard Snake, if you eat, you grow by 1, so the tail doesn't advance. If you don't eat, the tail advances. Here, \"You GROW by 1 segment\". So my length increases).\n        *   From (3, 0), I have options: Left (2,0 - empty next turn), Right (4,0 - apple), Up (3,1 - empty? Row 1: `. T T T T T`. (3,1) is 'T'. **DEATH** if I go Up).\n        *   So from (3,0), I can only go Left or Right.\n        *   Enemy Prediction:\n            *   He is at (2, 4).\n            *   He sees me at (2, 0).\n            *   He is trapped on the left side of the board (x=1,2) mostly.\n            *   If I go RIGHT to (3,0), I am claiming the bottom row.\n            *   Enemy might try to go RIGHT to (3,4). Is (3,4) safe? Row 4: `A A . . . . . A . T`. (3,4) is empty.\n            *   If Enemy goes RIGHT to (3,4), he moves away from me.\n            *   If Enemy goes DOWN to (2,3) or (2,2), he approaches the bottom.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **LEFT (1, 0):** Passive. No growth. I waste a turn. I let the enemy control the flow.\n        *   **RIGHT (3, 0):** Aggressive. Growth (+1 score). I control the bottom right. I force the enemy to stay on the left (x=0,1,2) or risk crossing me.\n\n4.  **STRATEGY & THE PLAN:**\n    *   I am ahead 16-9. I need to close this out.\n    *   The enemy is at (2, 4). If I go RIGHT to (3, 0), I am at x=3.\n    *   The enemy is stuck on x=2. If he goes to x=3, he comes to my side.\n    *   My body is at x=2, y=1.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (3, 0), and Enemy goes DOWN to (2, 3) or (2, 2), he is closing the gap vertically, but I am growing horizontally.\n    *   **The Trap:** I want to box him in. He is currently on the left side. By moving RIGHT, I am moving to the center/bottom. I can then move UP later (if safe) or continue RIGHT.\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** My head is at (2,0). My body is at (2,1).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (3,0).\n        *   Enemy goes DOWN to (2,3).\n        *   Next turn, I could go UP? No, (3,1) is my body (since my body goes (2,1), (3,1)...). So I can't go UP from (3,0).\n        *   I can go RIGHT to (4,0) (Apple).\n        *   Or LEFT back to (2,0).\n    *   **Why RIGHT is better:**\n        *   I get an apple. 17-9.\n        *   I push my \"front line\" to x=3.\n        *   The enemy is at x=2. He is sandwiched between my vertical body at x=2 (y=1+) and the wall at x=0.\n        *   If I take the bottom row apples (x=3,4,5...), I grow huge.\n        *   If I stay at (1,0), I am useless. I am at the edge.\n        *   **Force the Head-on?** I have 16 apples, he has 9. If we collide head-on, I win (16 > 9).\n        *   If he crashes into my body, he dies. I win.\n        *   If I crash into his body, I die. Bad.\n        *   If I move RIGHT, I am moving towards the apples. He is moving... likely DOWN or RIGHT.\n        *   If he moves DOWN to (2,3), and I am at (3,0), the distance is safe.\n        *   **The Winning Move:** Go RIGHT. Eat the apple. 17-9. Secure the bottom row.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the bottom row apples to extend my lead. Force the enemy into the corner at (0,0) or (0,9). If he tries to cross to the right side (x>2), I will block him or force a collision where I win because I have more mass.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

We're at turn 46 and I'm crushing it with 17 apples against his 9! \ud83d\udd25 Let's analyze this board state.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My Head: (3, 0) \n- Enemy Head: (2, 3)\n- I'm at the bottom row, enemy is one row above me\n- I just ate an apple at (3, 0) on the last move (moved RIGHT from (2,0))\n- My body is packed tight on the left side from (2,0) to (9,7)\n- Enemy body is vertical at x=2 from y=4-8\n\n**DEATH CHECK:**\n- **UP (3, 1):** Looking at board row 1: `. T T T T T . . . .` - (3,1) is 'T' (my own body!) \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN (3, -1):** Off the board \u274c DEAD  \n- **LEFT (2, 0):** Empty (I just moved from here) \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT (4, 0):** Apple! Looking at row 0: `. T T 1 A A . A A A` - (4,0) is 'A' \u2705 SAFE\n\n**EVALUATION:**\n- **LEFT to (2,0):** Safe but passive. I'd be backtracking. The apple at (3,0) is behind me now. This wastes momentum.\n- **RIGHT to (4,0):** I eat another apple! Score becomes 18-9. This extends my lead to 9 apples! From (4,0), I can continue RIGHT along the bottom row where there are more apples at (5,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (2,3). They're likely to:\n- Move DOWN to (2,2) or (2,1) to approach bottom apples\n- Move RIGHT to (3,3) to explore\n- If they move DOWN to (2,2), they're getting closer to my territory but I'll be at (4,0) - still safe distance\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm dominating! 18-9 would be a crushing lead. Taking (4,0) keeps me on the bottom row apple highway. The enemy is stuck on the left side. If they try to cross to x>2, I can cut them off or force a collision where I win (I have way more apples). \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue right along bottom row, eat all apples from (5,0) to (9,0). Build massive lead. Force enemy into corner at (0,9) or (0,0). If they try to cross to right side, prepare to box them in.\n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT for the apple and the W!\n\nRIGHT",

We're at turn 47, leading 18-9! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down carefully.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My Head: (4, 0)\n- Enemy Head: (3, 3)\n- I'm at the bottom row, enemy is in the middle-left\n- My body stretches from (3,0) all the way to (9,7) - a long barrier!\n- Enemy body is vertical at x=2,3 with head at (3,3)\n\n**DEATH CHECK - Moving NOW:**\n- **UP (4, 1):** Looking at board row 1: `. T T T T T . . . .` - (4,1) is 'T' (my own body!) \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN (4, -1):** Off the board \u274c DEAD  \n- **LEFT (3, 0):** Empty (I just moved FROM (3,0) to (4,0)) \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT (5, 0):** Looking at row 0: `. T T T 1 A . A A A` - (5,0) is 'A' (APPLE!) \u2705 SAFE\n\n**MOVES BREAKDOWN:**\n1. **LEFT to (3,0):** Safe. I'd be backtracking to where I just came from. This gives me no apple, no progress, and limits future moves. Not ideal when I have a huge lead to protect.\n2. **RIGHT to (5,0):** I EAT AN APPLE! Score becomes 19-9! This extends my lead to 10 apples! From (5,0), I can continue RIGHT to (6,0) or UP? (5,1) is 'T' (my body). So my only safe path from (5,0) is RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION - Turn 48:**\nEnemy at (3,3). Their options:\n- **UP to (3,4):** Row 4 has: `A . T . . . . A . T` - (3,4) is 'T' (their own body?) Wait, looking at enemy body: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (3,8)]. (3,4) is NOT in their body. So (3,4) is empty \u2705\n- **DOWN to (3,2):** Row 2: `. . . . . T T T T T` - (3,2) is empty \u2705\n- **LEFT to (2,3):** Empty (their previous head position) \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (4,3):** Looking at row 3: `. . T 0 . A A . . T` - (4,3) is empty \u2705\n\nEnemy has multiple safe moves. They're likely to move DOWN or RIGHT to chase apples. If they move DOWN to (3,2), they're getting closer to me.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Goal:** Keep extending my lead. I'm at 18, he's at 9. With 19 apples, I'm even closer to the 30-win condition.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Moving RIGHT to (5,0) puts me at an apple. My body will now stretch from (4,0) to (9,7). If enemy somehow reaches (5,1) next turn, they'd be next to my head, but that's unlikely.\n- **The Trap:** Actually, if I move RIGHT to (5,0), I'm creating a \"wall\" with my body. My body goes: (5,0) [new head] <- (4,0) <- (3,0) <- ... This creates a barrier along the bottom that could trap the enemy if they try to cross to the right side.\n\n**RECONSIDERING LEFT:**\nIf I move LEFT to (3,0), I don't grow. I stay at 18-9 lead. But more importantly, I keep both (4,0) and (5,0) as future options. From (3,0), I could go RIGHT to (4,0) next turn (but that's where I just was). Actually, from (3,0), my only moves are UP (dead), DOWN (dead), LEFT (2,0 - empty), or RIGHT (4,0 - where I just was). So moving LEFT traps me into a back-and-forth on the bottom row.\n\n**THE CRUCIAL INSIGHT:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,0) and eat the apple:\n- My body becomes: [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), ...]\n- This means (4,0) becomes my body. The space (4,0) is now OFF-LIMITS to everyone.\n- Enemy at (3,3) wants to reach bottom apples. To get to (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), they'd need to pass through (4,0) or (5,0) eventually... but (4,0) is now my body!\n- If enemy tries to go through x=4 at y=1,2,3... wait, (4,1) is my body, (4,2) is my body, (4,3) is empty... but (4,4) is empty... they could potentially go around.\n\n**BUT HERE'S THE KILLER:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,0) and eat the apple, I'm establishing dominance on the bottom row. The enemy is stuck on the left side. If they try to cross to the right side where all the apples are (there are apples at (7,4), (7,5), (7,9), etc.), they'll have to navigate around my long body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (5,0) and eat the apple (19-9 lead)\n2. Continue RIGHT along bottom: (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0) - all have apples!\n3. Then move UP from (9,0) to (9,1), but (9,1) is empty... wait, (9,1) is empty \u2705\n4. From (9,1), I can go UP to (9,2) but that's my body... no, (9,2) is 'T' (my body) \u274c\n5. Actually, from (9,0), I should consider going UP to (9,1) which is empty, then maybe LEFT to (8,1) or something.\n\n**REVISED PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (5,0) \u2192 Eat apple \u2192 Score 19-9.\nFrom (5,0), my only safe move next turn is RIGHT to (6,0) (since UP to (5,1) is my body). From (6,0), I can go RIGHT to (7,0) (apple!), then (8,0), (9,0). Once at (9,0), I have options: UP to (9,1) which is empty, or LEFT back to (8,0).\n\nThis keeps me growing while the enemy is trapped on the left. If they try to cross to the right, I can box them in.\n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT to (5,0) for the apple and the win! Let's gooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT would slam into our neck at (2,3) \u2014 nope.\n\n- WHY RIGHT? It keeps us in the clean middle corridor, eyes on the next apple at (5,3), and leaves multiple safe follow-ups. It also doesn\u2019t invite an immediate collision with Snake #1\u2019s dense lower-right cluster.\n\n- ENEMY MOVES: Snake #1 is deep in the bottom-right/center area and is chasing apples; forcing them to navigate around our push keeps them reacting rather than collapsing onto us. We stay aggressive but not reckless.\n\n- LONG-TERM FEEL: Rally toward the mid-right, threaten apples, force space, and look for a controlled head-on if we can out-pace him in growth and apples.\n\n- PLAYERS\u2019 TEMPO: We\u2019re at 9 apples; he\u2019s at 18.

That's a 11-apple lead! \ud83d\ude80 From (6,0), I can continue RIGHT to (7,0) (another apple!), then (8,0), then (9,0). This is the highway to victory!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (4,3).

The battlefield is set, and we're about to box this fool in for good.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My Head: (6, 0) - Right on the apple highway!\n- Enemy Head: (5, 3) - Trying to snake around on the left side.\n- My Body: We've got a MASSIVE wall snaking from (5,0) all the way up to (9,6). I'm essentially claiming the entire right side of the board!\n- Enemy Body: Sitting on the left side, creating a smaller barrier but mostly in their own way.\n\n**DEATH CHECK - MOVING NOW:**\n- **UP to (6, 1):** Row 1 shows `. T T T T T . . . .` - (6,1) is EMPTY \u2705 SAFE! This opens up the upward path.\n- **DOWN to (6, -1):** Off the board! \u274c DEAD  \n- **LEFT to (5, 0):** Row 0 shows `. T T T T 1 A . A A A` - (5,0) is 'T' (my own body!) \u274c DEAD\n- **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Row 0 shows `. T T T T 1 A . A A A` - (7,0) is 'A' (APPLE!) \u2705 SAFE AND DELICIOUS!\n\n**MOVES BREAKDOWN:**\n1. **UP to (6, 1):** SAFE! From (6,1), I can continue UP or RIGHT toward more apples. Good strategic positioning to dominate the upper-right quadrant.\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 0):** I EAT ANOTHER APPLE! Score becomes 20-10 (10-apple lead)! From (7,0), I can continue RIGHT to (8,0) (apple!), then (9,0) (apple!). This is the ultimate apple highway! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5,3). Their options:\n- **UP to (5,4):** Row 4: `A . T . . . . A . T` - (5,4) is empty \u2705\n- **DOWN to (5,2):** Row 2: `. . . . . T T T T T` - (5,2) is empty \u2705\n- **LEFT to (4,3):** Empty (where they came from) \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (6,3):** Row 3: `. . T T T 0 A . . . T` - (6,3) is 'A' (APPLE!) \u2705\n\nThey might go for that apple at (6,3) or try to escape the left side. But here's the thing - my body is blocking their path to the right-side apples! They're trapped in their little corner, and I'm about to take control of the entire bottom row!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) is the POWER PLAY! I'm:\n1. Eating another apple! 20-10 lead! \ud83d\ude80\n2. Securing the bottom row highway (next stop: (8,0), then (9,0))\n3. Forcing the enemy to stay on the left side with limited apple options\n4. Building an unstoppable wall that'll dominate the entire right side\n\nFrom (7,0), I'll continue eating the bottom row apples, then pivot UP to clean up the right side apples at (7,9), (9,0), etc. The enemy will be starved out on the left side, forced to make risky moves or die slow.\n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT to (7,0) for the apple and total board domination! Let's keep this W train rolling! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze this position and make the WINNING play!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My Score: 20 apples (HUGE LEAD over their 11!)\n- My Head: (7, 0) - Sitting right on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy Head: (6, 3) - They're nearby on the left side\n- My Body: Wall running from (6,0) to (9,6) - I literally own the right side!\n- Enemy Body: Small barrier at (5,3) to (4,8) - They're contained\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the visual map:\n```\n9 . . . A . . . A . .\n8 . . . . T A . . . .\n7 . . . T T A . . . .\n6 . . . T A A . . . T\n5 . . T T . . . A . T\n4 A . T . . . . A . T\n3 . . T T T T 0 . A T\n2 . A . A A T T T T T\n1 . T T T T T . . . .\n0 . T T T T T 1 A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**DEATH CHECK - WHERE CAN I GO?**\nFrom (7, 0):\n\n- **UP to (7, 1):** Row 1 shows `.

T T T T T 1 A A A` - (8,0) is 'A' (APPLE!) \u2705 SAFE AND DELICIOUS!\n\n**MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n1. **UP to (7, 1):** SAFE! Opens up upward movement. From (7,1), I can go UP to (7,2) which is empty, or RIGHT to (8,1). Good strategic positioning.\n2. **RIGHT to (8, 0):** I EAT ANOTHER APPLE! Score becomes 21-11 (10-apple lead maintained!). From (8,0), I can continue RIGHT to (9,0) (another apple!), then pivot UP. This maintains my bottom-row highway control.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (6, 3). Their options:\n- **UP to (6, 4):** Row 4 shows `A . T . . . . A . T` - (6,4) is EMPTY \u2705\n- **DOWN to (6, 2):** Row 2 shows `. . . . .

T` - (7,3) is empty \u2705\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (7,3), they're moving toward my territory! But if they go UP or DOWN, they stay on their side. \n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nSince I'm sitting on an apple at (7,0), eating it gives me the immediate score boost! However, moving RIGHT to (8,0) puts me one step away from ANOTHER apple at (9,0), creating a delicious apple highway. This also keeps my wall intact and maintains my dominance over the right side.\n\n**DECISION:** I'll take the apple! \ud83c\udf4e RIGHT to (8,0) for the score and continued board control! From there, I can pivot UP to clear the upper-right apples and keep the enemy trapped on the left!\n\nLet's keep this domination going! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

T T T T T . . . .` - (8,1) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (8, -1):** Off the board! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (7, 0):** Row 0 shows `. T T T T T T T 1 A` - (7,0) is EMPTY (my tail moves forward)! \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (9, 0):** Row 0 shows `. T T T T T T T 1 A` - (9,0) is ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n1. **UP to (8, 1):** SAFE! Opens up multiple paths - could go UP to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,1).\n2. **LEFT to (7, 0):** SAFE! But moves away from the apple at (9,0) and back into the body zone.\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 0):** DELICIOUS! I EAT ANOTHER APPLE! Score becomes 22-11 (11-apple lead!). From (9,0), I can pivot UP to (9,1) which appears empty based on the board state.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nThe enemy just moved RIGHT to (7,3), getting closer to my territory. They're trying to contest! But I have a HUGE lead. I should:\n1. Keep eating apples to extend my lead\n2. Maintain board control on the right side\n3. Prepare to box them in if they get too aggressive\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR CHAT:**\n*Stay aggressive! I've got the score advantage (21 vs 11). The enemy is trying to close the gap by moving right toward my territory. I need to keep eating apples and building my wall. My plan: eat the apple at (9,0), then pivot UP along the right edge (9,1) to (9,2), then maybe swing left to clear those top-right apples (7,9), (8,9). Meanwhile, I'll watch the enemy's movement - if they try to cross into my side, I can trap them against my body. Remember, with my lead, a head-on collision would actually WIN for me if I'm not dead!*\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to (9,0) for the apple and another point on the scoreboard! Let's keep this lead growing! \n\nRIGHT",

There\u2019s an apple at (8,3) too, but this sets us a bit closer to the right-side chaos.\n\nNOT SAFE:\n- DOWN to (7,2): that\u2019s where the rival\u2019s body sits. I crash into him, I die. Not today.\n- LEFT to (6,3): that\u2019s my own neck. Bad move, instant dead.\n\nDECISION: We\u2019re going UP to (7,4). It eats the apple, grows us, and preserves flexible options to dodge any late-game traps from the rival. We stay agile, not boxed in, and keep pressure without throwing our safety.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (7,4) this turn and grab that apple.\n- From there, keep multiple safe exits: (7,5), (8,4), and (6,4) are all viable, so we can dance around him instead of locking into a dead-end.\n- Avoid any head-on chase unless the apple lead flips in our favor; we\u2019re trailing ++- apples, so we don\u2019t want a reckless clash.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE (for the live stream):\n- Use the top-adjacent space to threaten a slower, controlled box-in approach. If he veers into a corner or toward the right edge, I\u2019ll tighten the squeeze while maintaining alternative paths.\n- Prioritize growth while preserving escape routes; if a clean head-on becomes favorable (and we\u2019re ahead in apples), we can pivot to that, but not while we\u2019re behind.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s neck and potential cross-fire with their body; avoid stepping into cells they\u2019re about to move into.\n\nFinal move plan: UP\n\nUP",

Let's break this down for the W!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 0) - Just ate that apple last turn! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **My Score:** 22 apples - that's a **10-APPLE LEAD** over Snake #0!\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 4) - They moved UP from (7,3) to chase an apple?\n- **Enemy Score:** 12 apples - still way behind!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the map:\n```\n9 . .

T T T T T . . . .` - (9,1) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE! (My tail will move forward, clearing (1,0)!)\n- **DOWN to (9, -1):** Off the board! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (8, 0):** Row 0 shows `. T T T T T T T T 1` - (8,0) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (10, 0):** Off the board! \u274c DEAD\n\n**MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n1. **UP to (9, 1):** SAFE! Opens up the right edge for continued expansion. From there, I can go UP to (9,2) which is currently occupied by my own body (9,2) on the board - WAIT! Let me check the board state again... (9,2) shows as `T` (tail). So if I go UP to (9,1), then on the next turn I cannot go UP to (9,2) because it's currently occupied. However, by turn 53, (9,2) will have moved forward (it's part of my tail). So this is still a viable path.\n2. **LEFT to (8, 0):** SAFE! But this moves me away from the right edge and back into the center. From (8,0), I could go LEFT to (7,0) which is empty, or UP to (8,1) which is empty.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nThe enemy moved UP to (7,4). They're not coming straight at me yet. With my 10-apple lead, I should:\n1. Keep expanding my territory\n2. Control the right edge - it's a strong defensive position\n3. Keep options open\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR CHAT:**\n*Stay aggressive! I've got the score advantage (22 vs 12). The enemy is still on the left side. My plan: go UP to (9,1) to secure the right edge. From there, I can pivot LEFT along the top or continue UP if it clears. This keeps me close to the top-right apples ((7,9), (8,9)) while maintaining board control. I need to watch the enemy's path - they might try to snake around to my side. If they do, I can use my length to trap them. With my lead, I could even force a head-on collision if needed, but let's keep it clean and build more lead.*\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (9,1) - secures the right edge and keeps my options open for future expansion toward the top-right apples.\n\nUP",
