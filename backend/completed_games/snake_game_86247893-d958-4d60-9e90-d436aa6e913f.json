We just ate the apple at (0,6) because we moved DOWN to it last turn.\n\n2. Our head is now at (0,6) and our tail (last segment) should grow by one, so the body is now: [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (0,6)]\n\n3.

So safe.\n- UP to (2,7): Is it free?\n  From the board mapping, there is no T at (2,7), and our body doesn’t occupy it. It should be safe. It might be a way to reach (7,7) apple later.\n- DOWN to (2,5): Is it free?\n  At (2,5) no obstacle is shown.\n- LEFT to (1,6): Our body occupies (1,6) (previous head), so moving left would mean crashing into our own body.\n\nGiven that (4,5) apple seems occupied or about to be occupied, it might be strategic to aim for another apple.\n\nOptions: The closest next sizeable apple is at (6,6) or (7,7).\n\nIf we move UP to (2,7):\n\n- Then we can try moving RIGHT along row y=7 from (2,7) towards (7,7).\n- The T's (traps/walls) at (0,7) are behind us; (1,7) seems free; (3,7) is free as well.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3,6):\n\n- Could try to get around to the apple at (6,6), going to (4,6), (5,6), (6,6).\n- But (4,6) might be dangerous since enemy snake is nearby and closer to that position.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2,5):\n\n- It moves away from the apples, possibly not ideal.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMoving UP to (2,7) seems safer and smarter, opening a path horizontally towards the apple at (7,7) while staying out of conflict zone near (4,5).\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\n- Move along row 7 to the right to reach (7,7).\n- Avoid getting near enemy snake head.\n\n**Move decided: UP**",

The last move was from (3,7) to (4,7), so (4,7) should be free now, but enemy does not occupy it.  \nAt (5,7): no enemy snake there. Enemy snake body includes (6,6), (6,5), etc., but not (5,7).\n\n\"Traps\" or \"T\" in map are mostly located starting row 6 and below near columns 1 to 5, so less immediately dangerous at row 7 except in the left area.\n\nOur snake's body does not block path to the right currently.\n\nSince the last move was RIGHT, the head is currently at (4,7). Moving RIGHT again to (5,7) seems safe now.\n\nWe should consider navigating around the enemy snake to avoid being trapped.\n\nAlternate idea: move UP one to (4,8) first to gain vertical space before moving right, avoiding being cornered in row 7 later.\n\nIs (4,8) free? From the board:\nRow 8 is: T T . . . . . . . . which means columns 0,1 = T (solid) and starting from column 2 empty.  \nAt (4,8) (column 4, row 8) is '.' free.\n\nMoving UP now keeps us safe and provides flexibility.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- Move UP to (4,8) for vertical freedom.\n- Then continue moving right towards the apple at (7,7).\n- Avoiding direct confrontation near (6,6) enemy snake.\n\nHence my decided move now is: UP",

My snake has grown and my body is now at [(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)].\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n- (8, 5) - 1 right, 2 down from my current position\n- (8, 2) - 1 right, 5 down from my current position  \n- (6, 2) - 1 left, 5 down from my current position\n- (7, 2) - directly below, 5 down from my current position\n- (5, 0) - 2 left, 7 down from my current position\n\nLet me check my movement options from (7, 7):\n- UP: (7, 7) → (7, 8) - This looks empty on the board\n- DOWN: (7, 7) → (7, 6) - This is where my body segment is, so not allowed\n- LEFT: (7, 7) → (6, 7) - This looks empty on the board\n- RIGHT: (7, 7) → (8, 7) - This looks empty on the board\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (4, 9) with body extending down, so it's not an immediate threat to my current area.\n\nStrategy consideration: The apple at (8, 5) seems like a good target since it's relatively close. To get there efficiently, I could:\n1. Move RIGHT to (8, 7), then work my way down toward (8, 5)\n2. Or move in other directions to approach it from a different angle\n\nLooking at the board layout, moving RIGHT to (8, 7) seems safe and positions me well to eventually reach the apple at (8, 5). This also keeps me away from the enemy snake and gives me flexibility for future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT, I'll be at (8, 7). From there, I can move DOWN toward the apple at (8, 5), which is just 2 moves away vertically.\n\nRIGHT",

Is (3,8) free?\n\n  The map at (3,8) seems free (no \"T\", no snake body)\n\n- DOWN: (4,7)\n\n  Going back down means moving on snake body (which is at (4,7)) — forbidden (would be colliding with own body)\n\nSo options:\n\n- UP to (4,9): safe and open.\n- LEFT to (3,8): also safe.\n- RIGHT is blocked by \"T\".\n- DOWN is backward — forbidden.\n\nEnemy threat to consider mainly from the right side, so better to stay away from closer proximity to (7,6).\n\nStrategic goals:\n\n- Apple at (7,7) is directly to the right and up — but currently blocked by \"T\" at (5,8), so direct path is blocked.\n- Other apples further downboard.\n\nIdea:\n\nMoving UP to (4,9) keeps us safe and even gives more vertical space for later moves.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,8) could be a blind alley or good for going around, but leaves us open to coming back to (4,7) if required.\n\nGiven that the last move was UP from (4,7) to (4,8), and (4,9) is free, moving UP again is consistent with earlier plan: gain vertical space first to avoid conflict and then curve around towards apples.\n\nNext turn plan:\n\n- After reaching (4,9), plan a path through (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), then down to apple at (7,7).\n- This keeps distance from enemy snake.\n\nConclusion: Move UP again.\n\nDecided next move: UP",
