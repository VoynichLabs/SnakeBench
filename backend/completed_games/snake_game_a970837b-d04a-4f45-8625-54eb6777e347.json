Let me break down this board state real quick because we're about to DOMINATE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## SITUATION ANALYSIS \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Position:**\n- Head at (3, 9) - we're chilling in the top row, pretty centered\n- No body yet, we're fresh and hungry! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Enemy Position:**\n- Head at (2, 2) - middle-ish area, pretty defensive\n- Also no body, so we're EQUAL on score\n\n**Board Awareness:**\n- Apples scattered all over - (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), (4,9) cluster in the TOP-LEFT area\n- More apples mid-board and bottom\n- We've got SPACE, lots of breathing room!\n\n## DECISION TIME \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me check all four directions from (3, 9):\n\n1. **UP**: Would move to (3, 10) - THAT'S OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! Don't even think about it!\n\n2. **DOWN**: Would move to (3, 8) - that's empty space, totally safe! \u2705 Keeps us flexible!\n\n3. **LEFT**: Would move to (2, 9) - WAIT! There's an APPLE there! \ud83c\udf4e That's a free grow AND it puts us closer to the apple cluster! Plus enemy is at (2, 2), nowhere near us! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Would move to (4, 9) - ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Also safe, also grows us! \u2705 Also good!\n\n## STRATEGY TALK \ud83d\udcad\n\nOkay chat, here's the thing - we've got TWO apple moves available this turn. Both LEFT and RIGHT grab an apple. RIGHT at (4, 9) is slightly more centered and gives us better board control going forward. But LEFT at (2, 9) sets us up to chain-eat more apples since there's a whole CLUSTER there at (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)!\n\nI'm going LEFT to start dominating that apple cluster in the top-left corner! This grows us early, and we'll have more options to box in the enemy as we get bigger! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Eat left cluster aggressively, grow our snake, control territory, then hunt down Snake #1 when we've got the size advantage!\n\nLEFT",

The board is WIDE OPEN, but we gotta establish dominance EARLY! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLooking at my moves:\n*   **UP (to (2,3)):** Opens up the center. Looks safe, no immediate threats. Lets me move towards the middle where I can control the board. Good options from there.\n*   **DOWN (to (2,1)):** Puts me near the bottom edge. A little limiting, but safe. Not the most aggressive play.\n*   **LEFT (to (1,2)):** Also safe, keeps me in the lower left quadrant. Not bad, but maybe too passive.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3,2)):** This is INTERESTING. Moves me closer to the enemy's general area (he's up top). It's a bold opening move, showing we're not afraid. Still safe.\n\nThe enemy is all the way at (3,9). He's probably gonna go for the cluster of apples near him at the top. My play is to start controlling the board's center and cut off his options later. Going RIGHT feels like the power move. It expands my territory and puts pressure on the middle.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is top-right. Start working UP and RIGHT to cut the board in half. Force him into the top corner. If we get longer, aim for a head-on collision where we win.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake #0 is up at **(2, 9)** with a body segment at (3, 9). He's already got one apple, so he's a little longer. We gotta be SMART and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**CHECKING OUR MOVES:**\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 3)):** This moves us UP towards the center. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. This gives us options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP next turn. Good for controlling the board!\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 1)):** Moves us DOWN. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. But this pushes us towards the bottom edge, which might limit our options later. A bit passive.\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 2)):** This moves us LEFT. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. But wait... our *previous* head was at (2,2)! Is that our body? NO! CHAT, OUR BODY LIST IS EMPTY! We just started, we have no body segments yet! So (2,2) is just an empty cell. This move is safe, but it's moving us back towards our starting area. Not the most aggressive expansion.\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 2)):** This moves us RIGHT. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. This continues our push to the right, expanding our territory and getting closer to the middle of the board. I like this energy!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is top-right with a 1-apple lead. We need to CUT THE BOARD IN HALF. Start moving UP and RIGHT to get between him and the rest of the board. Force him into the top-right corner. If we can get an apple or two and become longer, we can threaten a head-on collision for the WIN. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP feels like the best balance. It moves us toward the center for control, opens up multiple future paths, and starts our ascent to cut off the enemy. RIGHT is also aggressive, but UP gives us more immediate options next turn. Let's take control of the center!\n\nUP",

We just ate that apple at (2, 9) last turn and now we're positioned to DOMINATE! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake:**\n- Head: (2, 9) - top row, left-center area\n- Body: [(3, 9)] - one segment behind us\n- Apples: 1 (we're UP!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (3, 2) - middle area, pretty isolated\n- Body: none (still length 1!)\n- Apples: 0 (we're DOMINATING!)\n\n**Score Check:** We're UP 1-0! \ud83c\udfaf This is HUGE early game advantage!\n\n## DECISION TIME - LET ME CHECK ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (2, 9):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! Can't go there, chat!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 8) - WAIT! There's an APPLE at (2, 8)! That's a FREE GROW and keeps us in the apple cluster! \ud83c\udf4e Enemy is at (3, 2) - NOWHERE NEAR US! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 9) - Empty space, totally safe! \u2705 But no apple...\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 9) - OH NO! That's where our OWN BODY is (our tail at (3, 9))! \u274c We'd crash into ourselves! DEAD! Don't even think about it!\n\n## ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd25\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT\n\nProductive moves: DOWN (gets us the apple at (2, 8) AND continues the chain!)\n\nHere's the thing, chat - we're in the TOP-LEFT apple cluster and we need to MILK IT! The apples are at (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)... if we go DOWN to (2, 8), we:\n- Eat another apple (score becomes 2-0!)\n- Keep growing our body\n- Set up to potentially grab (2, 7) or the (1, 8) cluster next!\n\nMeanwhile, Snake #1 is chilling at (3, 2), still length 1. We're building a SIZE ADVANTAGE while they sleep! This is how we set up for the BOX-IN! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE TURNS:** Keep eating this left-side apple cluster to grow fast. By turn 3-4 we should have a 3-4 segment snake while enemy is still short. Then we position ourselves to cut off their escape routes and FORCE that head-on collision when we're bigger! Remember: AGGRESSIVE and AWARE!\n\nDOWN",

We are AGILE and DANGEROUS!\n\n**CHECKING THE MOVES:**\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 4)):** Moves us UP. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. This pushes us further into the board, getting us closer to that apple at (4,4) for next turn! Good expansion!\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 2)):** Moves us DOWN. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. But this is moving us AWAY from the enemy and the action. We're playing to win, not to hide! Too passive.\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 3)):** Moves us LEFT. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. This brings us closer to the left edge and the enemy's general area? But he's way up at (2,8)... maybe we can start cutting him off?\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 3)):** Moves us RIGHT. The cell is empty. \u2705 SAFE. This continues our push to the right, expanding our territory. Solid move.\n\n**THE ENEMY'S POSITION:** His head is at **(2, 8)**. Where can he go? He can't go DOWN into his own body at (2,9). So his options are UP (to (2,9) - HIS OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80), LEFT (to (1,8)), or RIGHT (to (3,8)). He's basically forced LEFT or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (3,8), he's moving parallel to us but way above.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We need to start boxing him into the top-right corner! He has a length advantage right now, so we avoid a head-on collision. Let's focus on growing and controlling the center. A move UP or RIGHT helps with that. UP gets us closer to an apple and central control. Let's be aggressive and start climbing the board to put pressure on him! We want to be the one doing the trapping, not getting trapped! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd2a\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP feels strong. It's a direct path towards growth and central control. We're not running from the fight, we're moving TOWARDS the enemy's territory to challenge him! Let's go!\n\nUP",

We just crushed that apple at (2, 8) and now we're positioned PERFECTLY to dominate! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake:**\n- Head: (2, 8) - left-center area, top zone\n- Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9)] - TWO segments! Growing nicely! \ud83d\udc0d\n- Apples: 2 (WE'RE UP BIG!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (3, 3) - middle area, still isolated and WEAK!\n- Body: none (STILL length 1!) \n- Apples: 0 (they're SLEEPING on us!)\n\n**Score Check:** We're UP 2-0! This is INSANE early game dominance! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## DECISION TIME - CHECK ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (2, 8):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2, 9) - OH NO! That's where our OWN BODY is (first segment behind us)! \u274c We'd crash into ourselves! DEAD! Can't go backwards, that's throwing!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 7) - WAIT WAIT WAIT! There's an APPLE at (2, 7)! FREE GROW! And enemy is at (3, 3) - MILES AWAY! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 8) - There's an APPLE at (1, 8)! Another FREE GROW! Enemy still at (3, 3) - not a threat! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 8) - Empty space, totally safe! \u2705 But no apple here...\n\n## ANALYSIS - THIS IS CRITICAL \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe have TWO apple-grabbing moves: DOWN (2, 7) and LEFT (1, 8)!\n\nHere's the deal, chat - we're in the APPLE CLUSTER on the left side! We've got a cluster of apples at:\n- (0, 8) and (1, 8) on our LEFT\n- (2, 7) BELOW us\n- (2, 7) could connect to more below\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1, 8), we:\n- Eat the apple (score 3-0!)\n- Get CLOSER to (0, 8) for next turn\n- Stay in the dense apple zone\n- Keep building our lead while enemy is still at length 1!\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2, 7), we:\n- Eat that apple (score 3-0!)\n- Move deeper into the cluster vertically\n- More flexibility on next move\n\nBut here's the STRATEGY, chat - LEFT keeps us CONNECTED to that (0, 8) apple AND we keep maximum flexibility! We're not boxing ourselves in. We stay AGGRESSIVE, we stay OPEN, and we keep GROWING!\n\nEnemy at (3, 3) is still a solo snake with NO apples. We're building a WALL OF APPLES and a GROWING BODY while they sleep! By turn 4-5, we'll have 4-5 segments while they're STILL at length 1. THAT'S when we start setting traps! \ud83d\udce6\n\n## PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\nKeep grinding the left apple cluster: (1, 8) \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 potentially pivot to (2, 7) and below. Build to 4-5+ segments, then start monitoring enemy position HARD. When they start growing, we'll have the SIZE ADVANTAGE to box them in or force a collision in our favor! Stay ALERT, stay AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

We just ate that apple at (1, 8) and we're sitting PRETTY with a 3-0 lead! Let me break down this board state RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake:**\n- Head: (1, 8) - left side, top zone\n- Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)] - FOUR segments deep! We're GROWING! \ud83d\udc0d\n- Apples: 3 (DOMINATING!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (3, 4) - middle area\n- Body: none (STILL length 1!)\n- Apples: 0 (They're STRUGGLING!)\n\n**Score Check:** We're UP 3-0! This is DISGUSTING early game control! The gap is WIDENING! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## DECISION TIME - CHECK ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (1, 8):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (1, 9) - Check the board... that's EMPTY! Safe move! \u2705 But no apple here, and it moves us to the top-right corner area. Could limit options next turn...\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 7) - EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705 But no immediate apple...\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 8) - THERE'S AN APPLE AT (0, 8)! FREE GROW TO 5 SEGMENTS! And the enemy is at (3, 4) - they're NOT a threat here! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 8) - OH NO! That's where our OWN BODY is (first segment behind us)! \u274c Can't go backwards into ourselves! DEAD! Can't do it!\n\n## ANALYSIS - THIS IS THE MOVE \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, this is SIMPLE and BRUTAL. We have ONE KILLER move here:\n\n**LEFT to (0, 8)** - We grab that apple, grow to 5 segments, and our score jumps to 4-0! Meanwhile enemy is STILL at length 1 with zero apples! We're building a MONSTER snake while they're sleeping!\n\nAfter we hit (0, 8), we'll be positioned at the LEFT EDGE. We can then pivot DOWN to grab (0, 0) or move RIGHT back toward the cluster. We're staying FLEXIBLE, staying AGGRESSIVE, and keeping our options WIDE OPEN!\n\nThe enemy at (3, 4) is ISOLATED and VULNERABLE. By the time they start making moves toward apples, we'll have 5+ segments and board control! This is where we START setting traps, chat! \ud83d\udce6\n\n## STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\nAfter this LEFT move:\n- We'll be at (0, 8) with 5 segments\n- Next turn, look to grab (0, 0) if safe, OR pivot back into the middle cluster\n- MONITOR enemy position HARD - if they move toward apples, we need to either steal their path or force them into a collision scenario\n- Our length advantage means we can START blocking lanes and funneling them into traps\n- Goal: Get to 6-7 apples while keeping enemy at 0-1, then execute a boxing strategy! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThis is CONTROL. This is DOMINANCE. This is how you WIN! Let's get it! \ud83c\udfae\n\nLEFT",

Our head is at (3,4) with NO BODY\u2014we're a ghost, ready to strike! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**CHECKING THE MOVES:**  \n- **UP (to (3,5)):** Empty cell? \u2705 SAFE. But no apple here! \ud83d\ude29 We're playing for growth, and this move doesn't get us fed.

Too passive\u2014we're not here to hide!  \n- **LEFT (to (2,4)):** Safe? \u2705 But still NO APPLE! \ud83d\udeab Moving left gets us closer to the enemy's x-position, but without growth, we're just a snack waiting to be crushed.  \n- **RIGHT (to (4,4)):** BINGO! \ud83c\udfaf This cell has an APPLE! \u2705 SAFE move, and we EAT and GROW to length 1! This is exactly what we need\u2014CONTENT and dominance! Plus, from (4,4), we'll have options to go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn (LEFT is blocked by our new body, but that's a good problem\u2014it means we're growing!).  \n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #0 is trapped in the top-left with head at (1,8). His moves? He CAN'T go RIGHT (into his own body at (2,8)), so he'll likely go DOWN, LEFT, or UP. But he's FAR away\u2014no risk of head-on collision this turn! \ud83d\ude0e We have space to GROW.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** After we eat this apple, we GO HARD! \ud83d\udc0d Next turn, we push UP towards (4,5) or (4,6) to pressure the enemy and cut off his escape routes. We need to box him into that corner while we grow longer! Remember, with each apple, we become a bigger threat\u2014force him into a mistake!  \n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR! WE EAT AND DOMINATE!  \n\nRIGHT",

We'd crash into ourselves! ELIMINATED!\n- **RIGHT (to (5,4)):** Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE. Puts us closer to the cluster of apples on the right side (like (5,6), (6,9), (7,4)). This is the AGGRESSIVE growth play!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #0's head is at (0,8). His body is at (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9). He's boxed into the top-left corner! His only safe moves are DOWN to (0,7) or LEFT to... oh wait, LEFT is off the board! So his ONLY move is DOWN! He's trapped! \ud83d\ude08 This is our chance to CUT HIM OFF! If we move UP or RIGHT now, we can start controlling the center and prepare to block his eventual escape routes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We need to GROW FAST. Snake #0 is longer, so a head-on collision now would kill us. We avoid direct confrontation until we're longer. Let's herd him into the corner! After this move, we should push towards the apple-rich right side (like (5,6) or (7,4)) to outgrow him. We can then swing up and left to completely seal his fate!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** RIGHT gets us closer to content and keeps the pressure on. UP is also safe but doesn't advance our growth as directly. We need those apples to become the bigger snake!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me analyze this board state RIGHT NOW because things are about to get SPICY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (0, 8) - LEFT EDGE, top area\n- Body: [(1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)] - STILL 5 segments DEEP! \ud83d\udc0d\n- Apples: 4 (CRUSHING IT!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (4, 4) - MIDDLE of the board\n- Body: [(3, 4)] - Only 2 segments! They're STARVING while we FEAST!\n- Apples: 1 (They caught ONE apple somewhere, but they're FALLING BEHIND!)\n\n**Score Check:** We're UP 4-1! The gap is MASSIVE, chat! We have 4x their length and MORE apples! This is where we START THE HUNT! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## CHECK ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (0, 8) \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (0, 8):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (0, 9) - That's the TOP-LEFT CORNER! EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705 No apple here though. We'd be in the corner which LIMITS our next moves...\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 7) - EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705 No apple, but keeps us on the LEFT EDGE with options...\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 8) - BOARD EDGE! We'd DIE! \u274c Can't go there, chat!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 8) - OH NO! That's where our BODY is (first segment)! \u274c Classic backwards move = DEATH! Can't do it!\n\n## THE PLAY - STRATEGIC POSITIONING \ud83c\udfae\n\nOkay chat, we only have TWO safe moves: UP or DOWN!\n\n**Why NOT UP to (0, 9)?**\n- We'd be CRAMMED in the top-left corner!\n- Next turn from (0, 9), we can only go RIGHT or DOWN - that's TIGHT! \ud83d\udeab\n- Corner positioning is DANGEROUS when you're trying to hunt!\n\n**Why DOWN to (0, 7)?**\n- We stay on the LEFT EDGE with FLEXIBILITY! \u2705\n- From (0, 7) next turn, we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT - that's THREE options! \n- We keep the board OPEN and keep hunting!\n- The enemy is at (4, 4) - they're moving somewhere AWAY from us this turn, so we're SAFE!\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY \ud83d\udccb\n\nHere's what I'm seeing for the NEXT FEW TURNS:\n\n1. **Turn 4 (NOW):** Move DOWN to (0, 7) - stay FLEXIBLE on the left edge!\n2. **Turn 5:** The enemy will probably chase apples in the middle/right areas (they're at (4, 4) with limited options). We need to START MOVING TOWARD THE CENTER to position ourselves for a BOXING TRAP!\n3. **Turns 6-8:** We're 5+ segments now - we can START HERDING the enemy! Force them into corners where they HAVE to collide with us!\n4. **The Win Condition:** With our 4-1 lead in apples, we just need to SURVIVE and GROW while the enemy STARVES! Eventually they'll have NOWHERE to go because we control the board!\n\nThe key is PATIENCE mixed with AGGRESSION! We don't rush head-first (that's how you lose), but we're CONSTANTLY tightening the noose! \ud83e\udea2\n\nLet's go DOWN and keep hunting! The enemy is NERVOUS right now, I can feel it! \n\nDOWN",

Smart play!\n- Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8)] - 5 segments DEEP!\n- Apples: 4 (FEEDING TIME!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 4) - STILL in the middle zone\n- Body: [(5, 4)] - Only 2 segments! They're STARVING while we FEAST!\n- Apples: 1 (Can't catch up!)\n\n**Score Check:** 4-1 advantage! That's DOMINATION right there! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## ANALYZING ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (1, 7) \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (1, 7):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (1, 8) - That's our BODY! \u274c Can't move backwards into ourselves! INSTANT DEATH! That's throwing the game, chat!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 6) - EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705 Moves us down the board with flexibility!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 7) - That's where our body WAS last turn, but it moves too! Our body segment at (0, 7) will move to... wait, let me trace: HEAD at (0, 7) moves, so (0, 7) becomes empty since the tail drops! \u2705 SAFE! This hugs the left edge!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Moves us further TOWARD the enemy at (6, 4)! Aggressive!\n\nSo we got THREE safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT! Now let's think STRATEGICALLY! \ud83c\udfae\n\n## THE STRATEGY - BOXING TIME! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Why DOWN to (1, 6)?**\n- Moves us down but we're not really closing distance on the enemy!\n- Enemy at (6, 4) is still far away!\n- This feels REACTIVE rather than AGGRESSIVE!\n- With a 4-1 lead, we should be HUNTING! \u274c\n\n**Why LEFT to (0, 7)?**\n- Keeps us on the left edge, safe territory!\n- But we're moving AWAY from the enemy!\n- We're just farming the left side while they potentially regroup!\n- TOO PASSIVE when we're AHEAD! \u274c\n\n**Why RIGHT to (2, 7)?**\n- We move TOWARD THE CENTER! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- Enemy is at (6, 4) - we're tightening the noose!\n- From (2, 7), next turn we can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT - MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY!\n- We're positioning for the BOXING PLAY!\n- The enemy sees us advancing and gets NERVOUS!\n- This is AGGRESSION with SIZE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLook at those apple drops at (2, 7) - wait, that's not in this turn's spawn. But there ARE apples scattered around the middle zones! If we push RIGHT toward the center, we're not just hunting the enemy - we're also opening up more foraging opportunities!\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turns 6-8 (AGGRESSIVE PUSH):**\n- RIGHT to (2, 7), then keep advancing toward x=5-6 range!\n- Force the enemy to move away from their comfort zone!\n- Every move we make, they PANIC because we're LARGER and FASTER!\n\n**Turns 9-10 (THE WALLS CLOSE IN):**\n- With 5+ segments, we START CREATING BARRIERS!\n- Trap them in a corner or force a head-on collision!\n- Remember: they crash into US, they DIE! We WIN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Win Condition:** Aggressive board control + superior SIZE + SPEED = they either starve panicking, or we force the collision and WIN!\n\nThe enemy is VULNERABLE chat! They only have 2 segments! We're coming for that W! RIGHT and let's START THE HUNT! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta be SMART and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**CHECKING THE MOVES:**\n- **UP (to (7,5)):** Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Opens up the top-right quadrant, puts us near apples at (7,7) and (8,7). Good expansion move!\n- **DOWN (to (7,3)):** Also empty! \u2705 SAFE. Keeps us central, but moves us away from the main enemy cluster. Could be a safe regrouping move.\n- **LEFT (to (6,4)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's our own body segment from last turn! We'd crash into ourselves! INSTANT ELIMINATION! NOT AN OPTION!\n- **RIGHT (to (8,4)):** Empty cell! \u2705 SAFE. Pushes us to the right edge. But chat, is that a trap? The edge limits our options next turn. Feels a bit risky long-term.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #0's head is at (2,7). His body is a big L-shape. His possible moves are UP (to (2,8), his body? \ud83d\udeab DEATH), RIGHT (to (3,7), empty \u2705), or DOWN (to (2,6), empty \u2705). He's gonna want to go RIGHT or DOWN to get more space and apples. If he goes RIGHT, he's heading towards the center. We need to CUT HIM OFF! We have the right side controlled. We need to move UP to claim that territory and get between him and the juicy apples on our side!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** WE NEED TO BOX HIM IN! He's stuck in the top-left. Our goal is to build a wall with our body along the top, from the right side towards the center. Moving UP to (7,5) is the first step! Next turn, we can go LEFT to (6,5) or (5,5), directly blocking his path to the right. We avoid a head-on collision for now (he's still longer), but we start constricting his space. GROWTH IS STILL KEY! Let's herd him into a corner!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP is the move! It's safe, it's aggressive map control, and it sets up our boxing strategy! We're not running, we're advancing!

INSTANT DEATH! That's throwing the game, chat!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 6) - EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705 Moves us further from our body, keeps us in the middle zone!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 7) - That's where our body segment is! \u274c DEATH!

That's when they make MISTAKES!\n- We're building our board dominance PIECE BY PIECE!\n- With a 5-2 lead, we CANNOT let them breathe! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, the GAMEPLAN is CLEAR! We're not here to play safe - we're here to DOMINATE! Every move RIGHT is us claiming MORE BOARD TERRITORY! The enemy can't fight back with only 3 segments! We're the APEX PREDATOR out here! \ud83e\udd85\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turns 7-9 (MAINTAIN AGGRESSION):**\n- Keep pushing RIGHT/CENTER to claim the middle zone!\n- Force enemy to make desperate moves!\n- Grab apples at (4, 9), (5, 1), (4, 1) if we can route through them!\n- Build up to 7-8+ segments!\n\n**Turns 10+ (THE WALLS CLOSE IN):**\n- With 7+ segments, we START CREATING INESCAPABLE CORRIDORS!\n- Trap them in a corner or force a collision!\n- Remember: they crash into US = INSTANT WIN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThe enemy is in SHAMBLES right now!

We just came from there, chat! Can't reverse!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move, continues our AGGRESSIVE PUSH toward center/enemy territory!\n\nSo we got THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT! Now let's think STRATEGICALLY! \ud83c\udfae\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEnemy just moved UP to (7, 5)! They're trying to escape toward the upper right! But chat, HERE'S THE THING - they've got NOWHERE to run! The board is only 10x10! They're BOXED IN and they KNOW IT! They're in PANIC MODE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWith only 3 segments, they CANNOT create walls to protect themselves! They're VULNERABLE! Meanwhile, we're 5 segments DEEP and still GROWING! The gap is WIDENING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THE STRATEGY - AGGRESSIVE CENTER CONTROL! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Why UP to (3, 8)?**\n- We move toward our own body (risky position-wise)!\n- Takes us to the top area where there are apples at (4, 9), (6, 9)!\n- BUT it also creates a potential boxing situation for us if we're not careful!\n- TOO RISKY when we're already winning! \u274c\n\n**Why DOWN to (3, 6)?**\n- Safe move, keeps us flexible!\n- Opens up multiple follow-up options!\n- BUT we're moving AWAY from the action and toward empty space!\n- We should be HUNTING the enemy, not retreating! \u274c\n\n**Why RIGHT to (4, 7)?**\n- We CONTINUE our aggressive MARCH toward the center-right! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- This keeps us in STRIKING DISTANCE of the enemy!\n- From (4, 7), we can pivot UP or DOWN next turn to cut off their escape routes!\n- We're building a CONTAINMENT STRATEGY!\n- With our 5-2 lead, we CANNOT let them farm apples and catch up!\n- This move says: \"We're coming for you!\" \ud83e\udd85\n- We're claiming the CENTER-RIGHT as OUR TERRITORY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, the ENEMY is FLEEING! They moved UP because they SENSE our dominance! We need to KEEP PUSHING! Every turn we give them breathing room is a turn they're getting back into the game! RIGHT and let's CONTINUE OUR CONQUEST! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 9 (RIGHT \u2192 UP PIVOT):**\n- After moving RIGHT to (4, 7), pivot UP to (4, 8)!\n- This puts us in the UPPER-CENTER zone!\n- Forces enemy to either flee further RIGHT or come DOWN!\n\n**Turn 10 (TIGHTEN THE NOOSE):**\n- By turn 10, we should be 6-7 segments DEEP!\n- Enemy will be CORNERED in the top-right corner!\n- We can start creating WALL formations!\n- They'll be FORCED into a collision! \u2694\ufe0f\n\n**Turn 11+ (THE ENDGAME):**\n- With superior length and position, we CREATE CORRIDORS!\n- They crash into us = INSTANT WIN! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Chat, we're looking at a VICTORY in 3-5 turns MAX!\n\nThe enemy made a MISTAKE running UP! They're TRAPPING THEMSELVES in the corner! We're the APEX PREDATOR and they're the PREY! Let's HUNT! \ud83e\udd85\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE PREVIEW FOR TURN 9:**\nAfter RIGHT to (4, 7), we pivot UP to (4, 8) to continue the aggressive containment and push them into a corner! We're not playing for apples - we're playing for DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

His apples are 5, ours are 2! Score gap but we're playing for POSITIONAL DOMINANCE!\n\n**CHECKING THE MOVES:**\n- **UP (to (6,6)):** Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Pushes our control NORTH, closer to that apple at (7,7)! AGGRESSIVE!\n- **DOWN (to (6,4)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's our own tail segment from last turn! We'd crash into ourselves! INSTANT ELIMINATION! NOT HAPPENING!\n- **LEFT (to (5,5)):** Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Continues our westward expansion, tightening the box! STRATEGIC!\n- **RIGHT (to (7,5)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's our own neck! We just came from there last turn! CRASH INTO OURSELVES! ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** Snake #0 is at (4,7) with a long body to his left. He's TRAPPED in the top-left! His only safe moves are likely RIGHT (to (5,7)) or DOWN (to (4,6)) to avoid crashing into himself or the wall! We're building a wall from the south and east! If he goes RIGHT, he's moving into our future territory! If he goes DOWN, he's retreating! OUR GOAL: CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** THE BOX IS FORMING! Keep building left and up! We want to occupy the cells around (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) to completely seal off the top-right quadrant from him! Once the box is tight, we can safely hunt apples on our side while he starves! THEN we go for the head-on when we have the length advantage! THIS IS HOW WE WIN!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP is the move! It's safe, it's aggressive map control, and it pressures the enemy while we go for that apple! LEFT is also safe and strategic, but UP gives us more immediate board presence and options! LET'S PUSH THE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Let me break down this CRITICAL turn!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 7) - We just PUSHED RIGHT like ABSOLUTE LEGENDS! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Body: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8)] - 5 THICC segments of PURE DOMINANCE!\n- Apples: 5 (FEASTING MODE ACTIVATED!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 5) - They're sitting there like PREY! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Body: [(7, 5), (7, 4)] - Still only 3 segments! PATHETIC! They can't compete!\n- Apples: 2 (We're in a CHASM of superiority!)\n\n**Score Check:** 5-2 advantage! That's a 3-APPLE LEAD! We're UNTOUCHABLE right now! \ud83e\udd85\n\n## ANALYZING ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (4, 7) \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom our head at (4, 7):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (4, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move! Takes us NORTH toward the apples at (4, 9) and (6, 9)! AGGRESSIVE!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (4, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move! Opens up the middle, but moves us AWAY from action!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 7) - That's our BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse into ourselves! We JUST came from there! THROW ALERT!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move! Continues EASTWARD push, but doesn't hunt the enemy!\n\nSo we got THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT! Now let's think STRATEGICALLY like the HUNTER we are! \ud83c\udfae\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEnemy is at (6, 5)! Here's the CRITICAL THING chat - they're BELOW us and to the RIGHT! With only 3 segments, they CANNOT create walls fast enough to escape our CLOSING GRIP! \n\nBut WAIT - there are apples EVERYWHERE around the map! If we're NOT CAREFUL, they could turtle up in the corner and start farming apples! We CANNOT let them catch up to our 5-2 lead! We need to DOMINATE SPACE and CONTROL THE BOARD! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## THE STRATEGY - AGGRESSIVE NORTHWARD PIVOT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Why UP to (4, 8)?**\n- This is the POWER MOVE! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n- We move TOWARD the apple at (4, 9)! Future growth incoming!\n- From (4, 8), we can PIVOT RIGHT next turn to (5, 8) or even (6, 8)!\n- This puts us in the UPPER-CENTER zone where we control territory!\n- The enemy at (6, 5) CANNOT easily catch us now - they're too far SOUTH!\n- But HERE'S THE KEY - if they try to run UP toward us, we're ALREADY in position to CUT THEM OFF!\n- We're building the BOX! \ud83d\udd12\n- With our 5-2 lead, we CANNOT afford to give them breathing room!\n- This move says: \"We're claiming the NORTH! This is OUR ZONE!\" \ud83e\udd85\n\n**Why DOWN to (4, 6)?**\n- Moving AWAY from the action!\n- Enemy has room to farm apples while we retreat!\n- They could catch up to 5-2! TOO RISKY! \u274c\n\n**Why RIGHT to (5, 7)?**\n- Safe but PASSIVE!\n- Doesn't put pressure on the enemy!\n- Doesn't get us closer to the apple zones where we can DOMINATE!\n- We need AGGRESSION right now! \u274c\n\nChat, we're the APEX PREDATORS! The enemy FLED to (6, 5) like COWARDS! Now we HUNT! UP and CLAIM THE NORTH! We're building a CONTAINMENT ZONE and they're about to be BOXED IN like never before! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 9 (UP \u2192 (4, 8)):**\n- We move NORTH to the upper-center zone!\n- We grab the apple at (4, 9) on Turn 10! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This puts us at 6 apples DEEP! Score advantage EXTENDS! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Turn 10 (PIVOT RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) or (6, 8)):**\n- We move EAST into their zone!\n- Enemy is FORCED to choose: RUN FURTHER EAST or COME DOWN/UP!\n- Either way, we're SQUEEZING them tighter! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Turn 11+ (THE ENDGAME):**\n- By Turn 11, we're 6-7 segments with board CONTROL!\n- Enemy is CORNERED in the top-right!\n- We create WALL formations and force a collision! \u2694\ufe0f\n- VICTORY INCOMING! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThe enemy made CRITICAL MISTAKES by staying small!

Puts us right next to that apple at (7,7)! AGGRESSIVE PUSH!\n- **DOWN (to (6,5)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's our own body segment! We'd CRASH!

His likely moves are RIGHT (to (5,8)) or UP (to (4,9)) which has an apple! If he goes RIGHT, he's moving parallel to us. If he goes UP, he's grabbing an apple and growing, making him even more trapped against the top wall! WE LIKE THAT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, THE BOX IS ALMOST SEALED! \ud83c\udfaf Enemy is pinned in the top-left. Our goal is to control the center and right side. We need to GROW to challenge his length advantage. Let's snake our way towards the cluster of apples on the right side (around (9,7), (8,9)) while keeping him contained. Once we're longer, we can force a head-on collision for the WIN! Don't get greedy, just control the space!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP and RIGHT are both strong.

Let me break down this CRITICAL turn where we need to EXECUTE FLAWLESSLY!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 8) - We just executed that UP move PERFECTLY! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7)] - Still 5 thicc segments of PURE CONTROL!\n- Apples: 5 (FEASTING MODE ACTIVATED!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 6) - They moved UP one from (6, 5)! They're HUNTING the apple at (6, 9) or trying to ESCAPE our GRIP! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Body: [(6, 5), (7, 5)] - Still only 3 segments! PATHETIC! They're DESPERATELY WEAK!\n- Apples: 2 (We're in a CHASM of superiority!)\n\n**Score Check:** 5-2 advantage! That's a 3-APPLE LEAD! We're UNTOUCHABLE right now! \ud83e\udd85\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nLet me check our position at (4, 8):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 9) - APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e INSTANT GROWTH TO 6 APPLES! This is PREMIUM!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 7) - That's our BODY! \u274c Can't reverse! INSTANT DEATH!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe, but moves AWAY from action!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe and EASTWARD toward enemy zone!\n\nSo we got THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN (WAIT NO - that's our body!), LEFT, or RIGHT!\n\nActually chat, let me RECALCULATE - DOWN to (4, 7) is where our body is RIGHT NOW! That's a REVERSE INTO OURSELVES! \u274c INSTANT THROW! We're NOT doing that!\n\nSo TWO safe moves: **UP to (4, 9)** or **RIGHT to (5, 8)** or **LEFT to (3, 8)**!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEnemy head at (6, 6)! Here's what I'm seeing:\n- They moved UP from (6, 5) to (6, 6)!\n- They're clearly hunting apples or trying to create DISTANCE!\n- BUT WAIT - if we go UP to (4, 9), we grab an apple AND we're in the TOP ZONE where we CONTROL SPACE!\n- If they keep moving UP, we're both in the north - and with OUR size advantage (5 segments vs their 3), we can BOX THEM IN! \ud83d\udd12\n\nThe CRITICAL THING: Enemy is at (6, 6). If we move RIGHT to (5, 8), we're moving TOWARD their x-coordinate (6) and we're ABOVE them! That puts us in PRIME HUNTING POSITION!\n\n## THE STRATEGY - AGGRESSIVE RIGHT PIVOT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Why RIGHT to (5, 8)?**\n- We move EAST toward their zone! AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- From (5, 8), next turn we can move RIGHT again to (6, 8) and we're DIRECTLY ABOVE their head at (6, 6)!\n- This is CONTAINMENT ZONE building! We're squeezing the noose! \ud83d\udd12\n- We're NOT taking the apple at (4, 9) YET - we're prioritizing BOARD CONTROL and POSITIONING!\n- With our 5-2 lead, we can AFFORD to be PATIENT and METHODICAL!\n- This move says: \"We're coming for you, and there's NOWHERE to run!\" \ud83e\udd85\n\n**Why UP to (4, 9)?**\n- We grab the apple immediately - growth to 6 apples! \u2705\n- BUT - this locks us in the TOP-LEFT corner for a turn!\n- Enemy can farm apples on the RIGHT side while we're stuck in apple mode!\n- They could catch up to 5-4 or 5-3! TOO RISKY when we're hunting them! \u274c\n\n**Why LEFT to (3, 8)?**\n- COWARD MOVE! Moving AWAY from the enemy!\n- They farm apples while we retreat!\n- We're the APEX PREDATORS - we don't retreat! \u274c\n\nChat, we're in PRIME POSITION! Enemy is at (6, 6) with only 3 segments! If we pivot RIGHT to (5, 8), we're setting up the ULTIMATE TRAP! Next turn we can push to (6, 8) and create a PINCER MOVEMENT! They're TOAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 10 (RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8)):**\n- We move EAST into their zone!\n- We're now at (5, 8) - DIRECTLY ABOVE and WEST of their head at (6, 6)!\n- We have TOTAL BOARD CONTROL in the upper-center! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Turn 11 (RIGHT \u2192 (6, 8)):**\n- We move directly ABOVE their x-coordinate!\n- They're TRAPPED between us and the board edge!\n- They MUST move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT - all of which we can PREDICT and COUNTER! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Turn 12+ (THE ENDGAME):**\n- We're 5-6 segments with SUPERIOR POSITIONING!\n- Enemy tries to escape SOUTH or EAST - we CUT THEM OFF!\n- They hit our body or the edge! COLLISION INCOMING! \u2694\ufe0f\n- VICTORY SECURED! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nThe enemy made CRITICAL MISTAKES by not growing faster! They're CORNERED! Let's execute this PERFECTLY!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me analyze this CRITICAL moment!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (5, 8) - We executed that RIGHT move PERFECTLY! We're now directly EAST of where we were!\n- Body: [(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)] - Still THICC with 5 segments!\n- Apples: 5 (STILL FEASTING!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 7) - WAIT! They moved RIGHT from (6, 6)! They're making a LATERAL move!\n- Body: [(6, 6), (6, 5)] - Down to 3 segments still! They're WEAK!\n- Apples: 2 (We're CRUSHING them 5-2!)\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nOur head at (5, 8):\n- UP \u2192 (5, 9) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 8) - That's our BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEnemy just moved RIGHT to (6, 7)! Here's what I'm seeing:\n- They're at (6, 7) with body at (6, 6) and (6, 5)!\n- If we move RIGHT to (6, 8), we're DIRECTLY ABOVE their head!\n- Next turn, they could move UP to (6, 8) and we'd have a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nWAIT CHAT - that's actually PERFECT for us! Here's why:\n- We're 5 segments, they're 3 segments!\n- If we collide head-on at (6, 8), BOTH of us die!\n- But that leaves the BOARD to whoever has more apples - and WE'RE 5-2! \ud83e\udd85\n- BUT HOLD UP - that's a DRAW situation, not a WIN!\n\nActually, let me think SMARTER here! \ud83e\udde0\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6, 8):\n- Enemy at (6, 7) could move UP and we collide - mutual destruction!\n- OR they could move LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT to avoid!\n- If they move LEFT to (5, 7), we're at (6, 8) - we DON'T collide!\n- Then NEXT turn, we can hunt them down! We're FASTER on the board!\n\nBUT WAIT - if we go UP to (5, 9):\n- We're in the TOP ZONE!\n- There's an apple at (4, 9)! \n- Enemy is at (6, 7) - they're SOUTH of us!\n- We can farm the top while they scramble below!\n- This keeps us SAFE and positions us for DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5, 7):\n- We're moving TOWARD the enemy's body zone!\n- This is TOO RISKY - we could get boxed in!\n- Enemy could move LEFT to (5, 7) and we collide! \u274c\n\n## THE STRATEGY - AGGRESSIVE UP PIVOT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Why UP to (5, 9)?**\n- We move into the TOP ZONE where we have TOTAL FREEDOM! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n- Apple at (4, 9) is RIGHT THERE next turn!\n- We'd grow to 6 apples while enemy stays at 2! (Could be 3 if they grab one)\n- We're BUILDING an INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD! \ud83e\udd85\n- From (5, 9), we control the entire northern territory!\n- Enemy at (6, 7) is in our DOMAIN now!\n- They have LIMITED escape routes! We're setting the TRAP! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**Why RIGHT to (6, 8)?**\n- Direct confrontation with enemy!\n- RISKY - could lead to head-on collision!\n- We need to be SMARTER, not just AGGRESSIVE! We're ahead 5-2, let's EXTEND that lead!\n\n**Why DOWN to (5, 7)?**\n- COWARD MOVE moving toward enemy's body!\n- Too many collision risks!\n- We're giving up board control! \u274c\n\nChat, we're in PRIME POSITION! We're ahead 5-2! Let's secure that lead with UP and farm apples while enemy scrambles! Then we'll EXECUTE the final trap!\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 11 (UP \u2192 (5, 9)):**\n- We move to the TOP ZONE!\n- We're at (5, 9) with enemy at (6, 7)!\n- We have FREEDOM to move!\n\n**Turn 12 (LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) or stay nimble):**\n- We farm apples in the top zone!\n- Enemy is BOXED OUT of the premium real estate!\n- We grow to 6, 7, maybe 8 apples!\n\n**Turn 13+ (THE ENDGAME):**\n- Enemy desperately tries to catch up!\n- We're UNTOUCHABLE with our size and position!\n- VICTORY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's GO!\n\nUP",

BIG MOMENT CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n*   **RIGHT (to (7,7)):** APPLE! \u2705 SAFE (cell is apple, not a body part). This is the GROW MOVE! We eat the apple and our tail stays put, making us longer. LET'S GET THAT CONTENT!\n*   **UP (to (6,8)):** Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Moves us north, but away from the immediate apple prize.\n*   **DOWN (to (6,6)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's our own body segment! We'd CRASH! NOT AN OPTION!\n*   **LEFT (to (5,7)):** Cell is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Moves us away from the apple, but is it a galaxy brain tactical retreat? Let's see...\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #0 is at (5,8). He's LONG (5 apples). He's pinned against the top and left walls. What can he do?\n*   **DOWN (to (5,7)):** This would be a move RIGHT towards us. Is he trying to fight? If we go LEFT, we could meet him head-on. We have 2 apples, he has 5. A HEAD-ON COLLISION KILLS US BOTH AND HE WINS DUE TO MORE APPLES! \ud83d\udea8 DO NOT ENGAGE IN A HEAD-ON UNTIL WE HAVE MORE APPLES THAN HIM! \ud83d\udea8\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,8)):** This would block our potential UP path.\n*   **LEFT (to (4,8)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** That's his own body! He can't go left.\n*   **UP (to (5,9)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** Off the board! He can't go up.\n\nSo his only safe moves are DOWN (to (5,7)) or RIGHT (to (6,8)). He's likely to go DOWN to try and pressure us or grab the apple at (6,9)? Wait, he'd have to go RIGHT then DOWN later. Hmm.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:** If we go RIGHT, we eat the apple and grow. Our head is at (7,7). If he goes DOWN to (5,7), there's no collision. We're safe and stronger. If he goes RIGHT to (6,8), he's just above us, but we don't collide. GOING RIGHT FOR THE APPLE IS SAFE AND ADVANTAGEOUS.\n\n**LEFT is a TRAP!** Going LEFT to (5,7) is asking for a head-on collision if he goes DOWN. We lose that trade right now. WE CANNOT TAKE THAT RISK.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE TOOK THE APPLE! WE'RE GROWING! Our new length is 4 vs his 6. The balance of power is shifting! The goal remains: DOMINATE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOARD. The apples at (8,9), (9,7) are our next targets. Stay aggressive but smart. Avoid head-ons until we have the apple lead. We're boxing him in! Slowly but surely! Let's control the space and force him into a mistake! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (5, 9) - We executed that UP move PERFECTLY! We're in the TOP ZONE now! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n- Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)] - Still 5 segments deep!\n- Apples: 5 (STILL DOMINATING!)\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (7, 7) - They moved RIGHT from (6, 7)! They're trying to ESCAPE to the RIGHT SIDE!\n- Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] - Still only 3 segments! They're WEAK, chat!\n- Apples: 3 (We're still CRUSHING them 5-3!)\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nOur head at (5, 9) - the TOP ROW, perfect positioning!\n- UP \u2192 (5, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't go there!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) - That's our BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) - EMPTY with an APPLE RIGHT THERE! \u2705 Safe AND profitable!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) - EMPTY with an APPLE RIGHT THERE! \u2705 Safe AND profitable!\n\nTwo safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT! Both have apples! Let's analyze! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## THREAT ASSESSMENT \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEnemy at (7, 7) with body at (6, 7) and (6, 5):\n- They're on the EASTERN side of the board!\n- Their body is BLOCKING the center-right zone!\n- They're moving AWAY from us (moving RIGHT shows they want SPACE)!\n- NO IMMEDIATE collision threat! We're SAFE! \u2705\n\n## THE CHOICE - LEFT vs RIGHT? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**LEFT to (4, 9):**\n- We grab the apple at (4, 9)! That's 6 apples! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We move WEST, controlling the left-top zone!\n- Another apple at (0, 0) is in that CORNER - we could farm the left side!\n- We're moving AWAY from enemy (they're at 7, 7 moving right)!\n- This EXTENDS our lead significantly! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n- We grab the apple at (6, 9)! That's also 6 apples! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We move EAST, getting CLOSER to enemy territory!\n- Enemy is at (7, 7) and moving RIGHT - if they go UP next turn to (7, 8), we're neighbors!\n- This could lead to confrontation when we're still SMALLER!\n- MORE RISKY since enemy is moving in that direction! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n## THE STRATEGY - AGGRESSIVE LEFT PIVOT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Why LEFT to (4, 9)?**\n- We GRAB an apple and grow to 6! \ud83c\udfaf\n- We control the ENTIRE LEFT-TOP zone!\n- Enemy at (7, 7) is FAR AWAY - they're Eastern-focused!\n- We're creating DISTANCE while GROWING!\n- The left side has apples at (0, 0) and (0, 1) - we can FARM those next! \ud83c\udf3e\n- We're EXTENDING our lead to 6-3 while keeping MAXIMUM SAFETY! \ud83d\udc8e\n- We leave our options OPEN - from (4, 9) we can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn!\n- Enemy will be SCRAMBLING to catch apples on their side while we DOMINATE our zone! \ud83d\udc51\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK board control! We're not just playing Snake, we're playing CHESS! We're up 5-3 on apples, we're positioning ourselves in the PREMIUM REAL ESTATE (top-left corner zone), and the enemy is on the OPPOSITE SIDE with limited options!\n\n## LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 12 (LEFT \u2192 (4, 9)):**\n- We grab apple at (4, 9), grow to 6 apples!\n- We control top-left zone!\n- Enemy scrambles on right side at (7, 7)!\n\n**Turn 13 (LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) or DOWN to farm):**\n- We continue farming the left corridor!\n- We're building an UNSTOPPABLE lead!\n- Enemy is boxed into right side!\n\n**Turn 14+:**\n- We dominate with 7-8+ apples!\n- Enemy desperate for scraps!\n- VICTORY incoming! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's GO! Time to show this archrival who's BOSS!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN STEP BY STEP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We just ate that apple at (7,7) and GREW! Now our head is at (7,7) and we're 4 segments long. The enemy is still at 5 apples. We're catching up!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head: (7,7)\nOur body: [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (8,7)):** Cell contains an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e \u2705 SAFE (apple is not a body part). We GROW again!\n*   **UP (to (7,8)):** Cell is empty 'dot'! \u2705 SAFE. Moves us away from the action...\n*   **DOWN (to (7,6)):** Cell is empty 'dot'! \u2705 SAFE. Puts us closer to the bottom-left apples.\n*   **LEFT (to (6,7)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body segment at (6,7)! WE CRASH! NEVER GO LEFT!\n\nSo RIGHT, UP, DOWN are all *technically* safe from self-collision and staying on the board.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f:**\nSnake #0 Head: (5,9) Body: [(5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)]\n\nHe's pinned in the top-left! Let's predict his moves:\n*   **DOWN (to (5,8)):** \u2705 SAFE? Wait, (5,8) is his own body segment! \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** He can't go down!\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,9)):** \u2705 SAFE (empty cell). This is his ONLY viable move! He must go RIGHT!\n*   **LEFT (to (4,9)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** Off the board! (x=4, y=9 is valid, but check his body... he has a segment at (4,8), so (4,9) is empty but... WAIT, the board shows an apple at (4,9)! Okay, so (4,9) is APPLE, not body. But look at the board state! From (5,9), LEFT is (4,9). That's on the board and has an apple. So LEFT is actually SAFE and gets him an apple! My bad chat! So his options are LEFT (to (4,9) apple) or RIGHT (to (6,9) empty).\n*   **UP (to (5,10)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** Off the board!\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: LEFT (to apple) or RIGHT (to empty). He'll probably go for the apple at (4,9)! That would grow him to 6.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b**\nIf he goes RIGHT to (6,9), and we go... where? We can't reach (6,9) in one move. No head-on risk this turn.\nIf he goes LEFT to (4,9), even less risk.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe have an apple RIGHT NEXT TO US at (8,7)! Taking it grows us to 5, matching his current length! If he grows to 6, we're still down by one, but we're dominating the right side.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (8,7)):** TAKE THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This is the AGGRESSIVE content grab. Puts our head next to another apple at (9,7). We're boxing him out of the entire right side! This is the power move.\n*   **UP (to (7,8)):** Safe, but kinda aimless. Puts us in the middle with fewer immediate options. We lose momentum.\n*   **DOWN (to (7,6)):** Also safe, but moves us away from the cluster of apples on the right and top.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE THROAT! Taking the apple at (8,7) extends our lead on the right side. Our goal is to trap him in the top-left corner. He's got limited moves. If we keep controlling the center and right, we can force him into a bad spot. STAY AGGRESSIVE, KEEP GROWING, and avoid head-ons until we have the apple advantage! We're playing to WIN, not to survive! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break this down with RUTHLESS precision!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 9) - We're in the TOP-LEFT zone like we PLANNED! \ud83d\udc8e\n- Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL AHEAD! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Length: 6 segments DEEP!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (9, 7) - They moved RIGHT from (8, 7)! Pushing HARD into the EASTERN corner!\n- Body: [(8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]\n- Apples: 5 - WE'RE UP BY ONE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Length: 5 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (3, 9):**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 9) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN or LEFT!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (9, 7):**\n- They're LOCKED in the EASTERN zone now!\n- Their body sprawls from (8,7) down to (6,5) - they're taking up that entire right corridor!\n- NO collision threat to us! They're isolated! \u2705\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, look at this BOARD CONTROL situation! \n\nThe enemy is BOXED into the right side of the map! They've got:\n- (9, 2) apple SOUTH\n- (9, 5) apple SOUTH  \n- (8, 9) apple NORTHWEST (but risky - surrounded by board edges!)\n\nMeanwhile, I've got the ENTIRE LEFT SIDE to farm:\n- (0, 0) - bottom-left corner! \ud83c\udf81\n- (0, 1) - next to it!\n- (1, 5) - mid-left!\n- (5, 1) - accessible via down corridor!\n\nThis is TERRITORY DOMINATION! While enemy fights for scraps in their corner, I'm about to FEAST on the abundance on my side!\n\n## THE CHOICE \ud83d\udd25\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- **DOWN to (3, 8)** keeps me moving toward the bottom apples! I can SNAKE down the left side and collect (5, 1), (4, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1)! This is a MASSIVE apple harvest zone!\n- **LEFT to (2, 9)** keeps me at the top but limits my immediate apple access!\n\n**DOWN is the AGGRESSIVE play!** We're moving toward APPLE DENSITY! We farm the bottom-left corridor and EXTEND our lead to 7+ apples while enemy stays stuck at 5!\n\n## LONG-TERM GAME PLAN FOR NEXT 5+ TURNS \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 14 (DOWN \u2192 (3, 8)):**\n- Head down to collect apples in the bottom-left quadrant\n- Start the HARVEST phase!\n\n**Turn 15-18:**\n- Continue DOWN and LEFT to grab (5, 1), (4, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1) in sequence\n- Build length to 8-10+ segments!\n- Create a WALL of our body along the left side!\n\n**Turn 19+:**\n- By then we'll have OVERWHELMING apple advantage (8-9 vs their 5)!\n- With our superior length, we START AGGRESSIVE BOXING!\n- Force them into corners they can't escape!\n- Eventually DOMINATE the endgame! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is CALCULATED AGGRESSION, chat! We're not playing defense - we're SECURING TERRITORY and HARVESTING RESOURCES! Classic domination strategy! Enemy can't compete when we've got 10 apples and they've got 5! The math doesn't work in their favor!\n\nDOWN",

We have TWO apples on our flank: one at (9,5) and one at (8,9). Going UP to (9,8) positions us PERFECTLY. Next turn, we can go LEFT to (8,8) and then continue leftward, or we can grab the apple at (8,9). This move starts our advance ACROSS the top, building a wall between him and the rest of the board! If we go DOWN, we're just going further away from him, letting him breathe.\n\n**THE MOVE IS CLEAR!** We go UP to (9,8)! This is the AGGRESSIVE, CONTROLLING PLAY! We are marching to seal his fate and claim this VICTORY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

Let me break down what just happened and where we're going!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 8) - We moved DOWN as planned! \ud83d\udc8e\n- Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)]\n- Apples: 6 - Still AHEAD by one! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Length: 6 segments of PURE DOMINANCE!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (9, 8) - They moved UP from (9, 7)! Interesting move!\n- Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)]\n- Apples: 5 - Still trailing us! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Length: 5 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (3, 8):**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 9) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (9, 8):**\n- UP \u2192 (9, 9) - EMPTY! They could go here!\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 7) - That's their BODY! Can't move there!\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 8) - EMPTY! They could go here!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 8) - OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nEnemy is LOCKED down! They're basically forced into LIMITED moves! That's the advantage we need!\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, look at what's happening here! Enemy is BOTTLENECKED in the top-right corner! Their head at (9, 8) with body blocking (9, 7) means they CANNOT push down easily! They're FORCED to move LEFT or UP next turn!\n\nMeanwhile, I've got the ENTIRE bottom half of the board WIDE OPEN! Look at those apples waiting for me:\n- (5, 1) - RIGHT below my body trajectory!\n- (4, 1) - Next in line!\n- (6, 1) - Another cluster!\n- (0, 0), (0, 1) - The corner JACKPOT!\n\nThis is TERRITORIAL DOMINATION in real time! While enemy gets BOXED, I'm about to FEAST!\n\n## THE CHOICE \ud83d\udd25\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n\n**DOWN to (3, 7):** \n- Keeps me moving TOWARD the apple clusters below!\n- (5, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1) are all DIRECTLY accessible if I continue down this column or shift right!\n- Opens up the ENTIRE bottom corridor!\n- Gets me closer to the corner apples!\n- This is the AGGRESSIVE HARVEST path! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LEFT to (2, 8):**\n- Moves me toward (0, 1) and (0, 0) corner apples!\n- Also strong, but slightly slower apple accumulation rate!\n- More lateral, less downward momentum!\n\n**DOWN is the move!** We keep the momentum toward the APPLE ABUNDANCE! We're building our lead from 6 to 7, 8, 9 apples while enemy stays stuck! By turn 18-20, we'll have OVERWHELMING advantage!\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE \ud83d\udccb\n\n**NEXT 5 TURNS PLAN:**\n- **Turn 15 (NOW):** DOWN to (3, 7) - continuing the harvest corridor!\n- **Turn 16:** DOWN again to (3, 6) - keep pushing south!\n- **Turn 17-18:** DOWN/LEFT combo to snake toward (5, 1), (4, 1) cluster!\n- **Turn 19-20:** Collect the bottom-left corner apples (0, 0), (0, 1)!\n\nBy turn 20, we'll have 8-10 apples vs their 5-6! THEN we start the aggressive boxing! With our superior length and apple count, we force head-on collisions where we're the PREDATOR, not the prey! Enemy can't compete when we've got HALF the board's resources! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is CALCULATED DOMINATION! Keep farming, keep growing, then FINISH THEM! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Next turn, we can go LEFT along the top wall, cutting off his escape route and slowly squeezing him to death! If we go LEFT now to (8,8), sure, it's safe, but it's a passive move. We let him have room to breathe. Going UP is AGGRESSIVE! We're taking the high ground and starting the BOX-IN! He has 6 apples, we have 5. If we eat this one, we TIE the score, putting us in a better position for a potential head-on collision later! THIS IS THE MOVE! We PRESS THE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**FINAL STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** He's forced left. Secure the top-right by eating the apple.

Length 6!)\n*   **RIGHT (to (10,9)):** \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT DO IT! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (9,8)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body at (9,8)! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to (8,9)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE! This is our plan!\n*   **UP (to (9,10)):** \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\nSo our ONLY safe move is LEFT to (8,9)! Chat, we are on the EDGE! Literally!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & VERIFICATION \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f:**\nLast turn we predicted he'd go LEFT to (2,8). Let's check the board!\nHis head is now at (2, 8)! WE CALLED IT! HE'S STUCK ON THE TOP WALL! His body is now: [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7)] (He grew too? Wait, his length is 7, ours is 6. He must have eaten an apple we didn't see on the board state. He's at 6 apples, we're at 5. He's still ahead!)\n\nFrom (2,8), where can he go?\n*   **UP (to (2,9)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **DOWN (to (2,7)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE! OH NO CHAT! HE HAS AN ESCAPE ROUTE DOWN! He's not as trapped as we thought!\n*   **LEFT (to (1,8)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (3,8)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** His own body! \u274c\n\nHe has THREE safe moves! Our box-in plan is in DANGER! We need to act FAST!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b**\nWe are going to (8,9). He could go to (2,9), but that's 6 cells away. NO risk of a head-on collision this turn. We're SAFE.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nALRIGHT CHAT! ADJUST THE STRATEGY! He has a way down! We cannot let him get into the open board! Our plan to move left along the top row is STILL GOOD! We need to build that wall! We go LEFT to (8,9). This continues our path to cut off the top. Next turn, we'll be at (8,9) and can go LEFT again to (7,9), then (6,9) which is an apple! We need to keep him contained on the left side. If he goes down on his next turn, we might have to change tactics and chase, but for now, STICK TO THE PLAN! We need to dominate the top edge to limit his space! He has a higher score, so we want to avoid a head-on collision for now. We need to GROW and outmaneuver him!\n\n**FINAL STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** He has an escape down from (2,8). Continue moving left along y=9 to claim the top. Be ready to pivot if he drops down to y=7. We need to match his score to enable a winning head-on collision.\n\nLEFT",

Let me break down what just went DOWN!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 7) - We moved DOWN as planned! Perfect execution! \ud83d\udc8e\n- Body: [(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)]\n- Apples: 6 - Still AHEAD by one! We're the APEX! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Length: 6 segments of PURE DOMINANCE!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (9, 9) - They moved UP from (9, 8)! Classic corner trap! \ud83e\udea4\n- Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)]\n- Apples: 5 - Still trailing! They're VULNERABLE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Length: 5 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (3, 7) - Let's check all options:**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 8) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (9, 9) - They're BOXED in!**\n- UP \u2192 (9, 10) - OFF BOARD! \u274c DEAD!\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 8) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 9) - EMPTY! Only real option!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 9) - OFF BOARD! \u274c DEAD!\n\n**Chat, look at this!** Enemy is TRAPPED in the corner! They literally CAN ONLY move LEFT next turn to (8, 9)! This is EXACTLY what we want! They're HEMMED IN while we've got the ENTIRE board! \ud83c\udfad\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOkay fam, here's the DIAMOND INSIGHT:\n\nEnemy made a CRITICAL mistake moving UP to the corner! Now they're literally ONE bad move away from dying! If they're forced into a pattern where they keep hitting the top-right edges, we can PREDICT their movements and set up the PERFECT trap!\n\nMeanwhile, I've got THREE safe moves, but only ONE is DOMINANT:\n\n**DOWN to (3, 6):**\n- Continues pushing toward the APPLE CLUSTERS below!\n- (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1) - the JACKPOT corridor!\n- Keeps me in the CENTER-SOUTH territory where apples are ABUNDANT!\n- Maintains maximum flexibility for future turns! \u2705\n- This is the HARVEST PATH! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LEFT to (2, 7):**\n- Moves lateral, slower apple accumulation!\n- Not pushing toward the rich apple zones efficiently!\n- Less aggressive positioning!\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n- Moving toward enemy territory (they're at 9, 9)!\n- Could be interesting for future boxing, but TOO EARLY!\n- We need apples FIRST, aggression SECOND!\n\n**DOWN is the MOVE!** We keep farming, keep growing! By turn 18-20, when we have 8-10 apples to their 5-6, THEN we pivot aggressive and box them into oblivion! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE \ud83d\udccb\n\n**NEXT 5 TURNS REVISED PLAN:**\n- **Turn 16 (NOW):** DOWN to (3, 6) - HARVEST MODE ENGAGED!\n- **Turn 17:** DOWN to (3, 5) - keep the momentum!\n- **Turn 18:** RIGHT to (4, 5) or (5, 5) - shift toward apple clusters!\n- **Turn 19-20:** Push hard toward (5, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1) - FEAST TIME!\n- **Turn 21+:** With massive apple lead, start BOXING enemy using our superior length!\n\nEnemy can't farm efficiently trapped in corner! We DOMINATE the board! GG INCOMING! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 6) - We moved DOWN perfectly last turn! \ud83d\udc8e\n- Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n- Apples: 6 - TIED with enemy! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Length: 6 segments of PURE CONTROL!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (8, 9) - They moved LEFT from corner trap! Classic corner escape! \ud83e\udea4\n- Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL TIED! This is HIGH STAKES, chat! \u26a1\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (3, 6) - Let's analyze ALL options:**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 7) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't go backwards!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 5) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe AND apple at (1, 5) nearby!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (8, 9) - What are THEIR options?**\n- UP \u2192 (8, 10) - OFF BOARD! \u274c DEAD!\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 8) - EMPTY! Safe option!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 9) - EMPTY! Safe option!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 9) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n\nEnemy has two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. They're still constrained! \n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOkay chat, THIS IS CRITICAL! We're TIED at 6-6! This is a RACE now! Every apple matters! The next few turns determine EVERYTHING! \n\nLet me check the apple distribution:\n- **(5, 6)** - RIGHT next to us at (3, 6)! If we go RIGHT, we move toward it!\n- **(6, 4)** - South of (5, 6), accessible territory!\n- **(5, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1)** - The JACKPOT CORRIDOR in the south!\n- **(1, 5)** - LEFT side, close by if we need it!\n\n**DOWN to (3, 5):**\n- Continues our southern push toward the apple corridor!\n- Maintains flexibility for next turn (can go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT from there)!\n- Keeps us moving toward HIGH-VALUE apple zones!\n- NOT moving us toward enemy territory where collision risk exists!\n- This is AGGRESSIVE FARMING! \ud83c\udf3e\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n- Gets us CLOSER to apple at (5, 6)!\n- But then we're RIGHT next to enemy territory!\n- Too early to be that aggressive when we're TIED!\n- Could trap us if enemy moves DOWN and pushes toward us!\n\n**LEFT to (2, 6):**\n- Moving away from apples!\n- NOT the play when we need growth DESPERATELY!\n\n**DOWN is the MOVE!** We keep farming efficiently while maintaining OPTIONS! By turn 20, if we've got 8+ apples and enemy is still at 6, we can PIVOT AGGRESSIVE and start boxing! But right now? HARVEST MODE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## NEXT 5 TURNS GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 17 (NOW):** DOWN to (3, 5) - Continue south!\n- **Turn 18:** RIGHT to (4, 5) - Shift toward apple clusters!\n- **Turn 19:** RIGHT to (5, 5) OR DOWN depending on apple spots!\n- **Turn 20:** Push hard into the (5, 1)-(4, 1)-(6, 1) zone - FEAST MODE!\n- **Turn 21+:** With apple lead secured, START THE BOX! Enemy gets HEMMED IN while we've got the board! \ud83d\udc51\n\nWe're in CONTROL! Let's execute! FARM FIRST, DOMINATE SECOND! That's the CHAMPIONSHIP MINDSET! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nDOWN",

LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOOD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head: (8, 9)\nOur body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)] Length 6!\n*   **UP (to (8,10)):** \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT DO IT! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (8,8)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 Looks safe! Let's check...\n*   **LEFT (to (7,9)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (9,9)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body at (9,9)! CRASH! \u274c\n\nSo we have TWO safe moves: DOWN and LEFT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head: (3, 6)\nWhere can he go? Let's simulate!\n*   **UP (to (3,7)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** His own body! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (3,5)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (2,6)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,6)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nWow, he has THREE safe moves! Where will he go? If he goes RIGHT or DOWN, he moves away from us. But if he goes LEFT to (2,6), he's moving towards the left side, which is our territory! We're at (8,9). A head-on collision is IMPOSSIBLE this turn, we're too far apart. We're safe from that.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nALRIGHT CHAT! We gotta think! We're tied at 6 apples each. We can't risk a head-on collision yet, it's a tie, so we'd both die! Our plan was to build a wall along the top. But the enemy is WAY down at y=6! If we stick to the top with LEFT to (7,9), we're staying away from him and letting him roam free on the bottom half of the board. That's BAD! He could grab all the apples down there!\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! We need to CUT HIM OFF! The BEST move is DOWN to (8,8)! This moves us INTO the board, towards the center, and starts putting pressure on him! From (8,8) next turn, we can go DOWN again or LEFT/DOWN to chase him! We need to get between him and the apples! Look at all those apples on the bottom and left! (0,0), (0,1), (1,3), (1,5)! He's gonna go for those! We need to intercept!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,9), we're just staying in our corner while he feasts. NO WAY!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** He's loose on the bottom half! We must abandon the pure top-wall plan and engage! Go DOWN to (8,8) to begin the chase. Our goal is to get between his head and the cluster of apples on the left/bottom. Force him into a corner! Match his growth, then use our superior positioning to force a winning head-on collision when we have the score advantage!\n\nDOWN",

Let me read this board like a CHAMPIONSHIP playbook!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 5) - We executed the DOWN move PERFECTLY last turn! \ud83d\udc8e\n- Body: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL TIED! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (8, 8) - They moved DOWN from (8, 9)! Classic move! \n- Body: [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL LOCKED AT 6-6! This is INTENSE! \u26a1\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (3, 5) - Let's analyze ALL options:**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (8, 8) - What are THEIR options?**\n- UP \u2192 (8, 9) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 7) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 8) - EMPTY! Safe option!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n\nWait chat... ENEMY ONLY HAS ONE SAFE MOVE: LEFT to (7, 8)! They're BOXED IN! \ud83e\udea4 This is CRITICAL!\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOkay, THIS IS THE MOMENT! Enemy is constrained to ONE move (LEFT), which means they're PREDICTABLE! Let me think about our positioning:\n\n**Available safe moves for us:**\n1. **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5)** - Moves toward apple at (5, 6)! This is AGGRESSIVE! If we keep pushing RIGHT, we control the upper-middle board!\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (3, 4)** - Continues south toward the apple corridor at (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)! FARMING ZONE!\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (2, 5)** - Apple at (1, 5) is ONE CELL AWAY! We can grab it next turn!\n\n**The PLAY, chat?** \n\nLEFT to (2, 5) is GENIUS right now! Here's why:\n\n- We grab apple at (1, 5) NEXT TURN if we position correctly!\n- Enemy is forced LEFT to (7, 8), which keeps them in the CORNER!\n- We maintain board control in the LEFT-MIDDLE zone!\n- We GET +1 APPLE and go 7-6 UP! \ud83d\udcc8\n- By growing, we start BOXING the enemy as our body gets longer!\n- Enemy has LIMITED escape routes and we're harvesting the board!\n\nThis is CALCULATED AGGRESSION! We're not rushing to collision, but we're HARVESTING and growing our advantage!\n\n## NEXT 5 TURNS GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 18 (NOW):** LEFT to (2, 5) - Position for apple grab at (1, 5)!\n- **Turn 19:** DOWN or RIGHT to grab (1, 5) apple - GO TO 7-6!\n- **Turn 20:** Continue farming southern corridor OR push EAST depending on enemy position!\n- **Turn 21+:** With apple lead (7-6), start AGGRESSIVE positioning to box enemy near walls!\n- **Turn 25+:** Once we hit 8+ apples with enemy at 6, FORCE HEAD-ON if needed - we WIN that trade!\n\nWe're executing PERFECTLY! Enemy is CONSTRAINED and we're FARMING! Championship mentality right here! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLEFT",

LET'S BREAK IT DOWN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head: (8, 8)\nOur body: [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)] ... wait, our last body segment from last turn (6,7) is gone! We didn't eat an apple, so we just moved! So our body is correct above. Length 6!\n*   **UP (to (8, 9)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body! We just moved from there! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 7)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 8)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 8)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body! CRASH! \u274c\n\nWOAH! Only ONE safe move: LEFT to (7,8)! We moved DOWN last turn and now our body is blocking our path! Classic snake problems!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head: (3, 5)\nWhere can he go? Let's check his new possible moves!\n*   **UP (to (3, 6)):** \ud83d\udeab **DEATH MOVE!** His own body! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 4)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 5)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 5)):** Cell is empty '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nHe still has three moves! WHERE IS HE GOING? He's right next to apples at (1,5) and (5,6)! He's probably going to chase points. If he goes LEFT to (2,5), he's heading for that (1,5) apple! If he goes RIGHT to (4,5), he's moving towards the center and the (5,6) apple. We are STUCK up here. A head-on collision is impossible right now.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nALRIGHT CHAT! WE'RE IN A SPOT! We got ourselves trapped by our own body! We have NO CHOICE but to go LEFT to (7,8). But this is okay! This is part of the LONG CON!\n\nFrom (7,8), let's see our next possible moves for TURN 19 to avoid getting trapped again:\n*   UP to (7,9): Our body is at (8,9) and (9,9), but (7,9) is empty! So UP is a FUTURE safe move.\n*   DOWN to (7,7): \ud83d\udeab That's our body! NOT SAFE next turn.\n*   LEFT to (6,8): EMPTY! \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (8,8): \ud83d\udeab That's our body! NOT SAFE.\n\nSo next turn from (7,8), we'll have UP and LEFT as safe moves. We need to break out of this top-right corner and get DOWN towards the enemy! Our plan is to start weaving DOWN the LEFT SIDE of the board! From (7,8) -> maybe (6,8) -> then (6,7)... we can work our way down the left edge! This will put us in a position to cut off the enemy from the apples on the left side like (0,0), (0,1), (1,3)! We can't let him have those for free!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** We got temporarily blocked! Forced LEFT to (7,8). Next turn, prioritize moving LEFT to (6,8) to start our descent down the left side of the board. We need to get between the enemy and the apple cluster on the bottom-left! Force him towards the center where we can control the space. We need to gain an apple advantage to force a winning head-on collision!\n\nLEFT",

I READ THEM LIKE A BOOK! \ud83d\udcd6\n- Body: [(8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL LOCKED AT 6-6! THE PRESSURE IS ON! \u26a1\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (2, 5) - Let's analyze ALL options:**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 4) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 5) - **APPLE RIGHT HERE!!!** \ud83c\udf4e This is JUICE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 5) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (7, 8) - What are THEIR options?**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 9) - EMPTY! Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 7) - EMPTY! Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 8) - EMPTY! Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8) - That's their BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n\nEnemy has THREE safe moves! They're getting out of the corner! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, THIS IS THE CRITICAL TURN! We have a DIRECT apple at (1, 5) ONE CELL AWAY to our LEFT! But here's the thing - I gotta think TWO TURNS ahead! \n\n**Option 1: LEFT \u2192 (1, 5)** \n- \u2705 We grab the apple IMMEDIATELY! 7-6 UP! \ud83d\udcc8\n- \u2705 We go into LEAD mode!\n- \u2753 But what's NEXT turn? After eating at (1, 5), our new head will be at (1, 5), and our body extends to (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9)\n- \u2753 Our options get MORE constrained - we're pushed to the left edge!\n\n**Option 2: DOWN \u2192 (2, 4)**\n- \u2705 Stays safe and keeps options open!\n- \u2705 Moves us toward the apple corridor at (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)!\n- \u274c We DON'T grab the (1, 5) apple this turn!\n- \u274c Enemy could farm apples and catch up!\n\n**Option 3: UP \u2192 (2, 6)**\n- \u2705 Safe move!\n- \u274c Moves us AWAY from apples!\n- \u274c Doesn't advance our position!\n\nChat, I'm thinking AGGRESSIVE here! \ud83c\udfaf \n\n**THE PLAY:** LEFT to (1, 5)! Here's why this is CHAMPIONSHIP ENERGY:\n\n1. **We go 7-6 UP!** We take the LEAD! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **Psychological pressure!** Enemy sees we're farming and it tilts them!\n3. **Immediate growth!** Our snake gets LONGER, which means we control MORE board space!\n4. **Position for dominance!** From (1, 5), next turn we can pivot DOWN toward the southern apple corridor and build a FORTRESS!\n5. **We're NOT getting trapped!** The left edge actually gives us clear farming routes downward!\n\nEnemy is at (7, 8) - they're FAR from this apple cluster we're about to farm! They can't stop us! We're moving TOO FAST! \u26a1\n\n## NEXT 5 TURNS GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 19 (NOW):** LEFT to (1, 5) - GRAB THE APPLE! Go 7-6! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 20:** DOWN to (1, 4) - Continue farming the left column!\n- **Turn 21:** DOWN to (1, 3) - Another apple at (1, 3) is RIGHT THERE!\n- **Turn 22:** DOWN to (1, 2) - We're getting MASSIVE!\n- **Turn 23+:** Pivot right or stay left depending on enemy position, but we'll be UP by 3-4 apples and DOMINATING!\n\nBy turn 25, we'll be at 9-10 apples while they're stuck at 6! Then it's JUST CLEANUP! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLEFT",

LET'S SEE THE NEW LAYOUT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head is now at (7, 8) after moving LEFT last turn!\nOur body: [(8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7)]\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 9)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **DOWN (to (7, 7)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body segment at (8,7)! Our body wraps around! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to (6, 8)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (8, 8)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body! We just left there! CRASH! \u274c\n\nALRIGHT! Two safe moves: UP and LEFT! Just like we predicted last turn!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head is at (2, 5). WHERE DID HE GO LAST TURN? He was at (3,5) and could go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. He's probably chasing apples! Let's see what's near him: (1,5) apple to his LEFT/WEST, (5,6) apple to his EAST, and (1,3) apple to his SOUTH-WEST. He's greedy! He wants to catch up to our score!\n*   **Head-on risk?** He's at (2,5). He could move UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5) (APPLE!), or RIGHT to (3,5). We're at (7,8). No chance of a head-on collision this turn. SAFE.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nAlright Chat, we gotta execute the plan! Last turn we said we'd break out of the corner and descend down the LEFT side to cut off the enemy from the bottom-left apple cluster!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: UP to (7,9)**. This keeps us along the top edge. But then what? From (7,9), next turn we could only go LEFT (to 6,9) because RIGHT (8,9) is our body and DOWN (7,8) is our body. That feels like we're just delaying the inevitable and staying trapped up here. Not aggressive!\n\n*   **OPTION 2: LEFT to (6,8)**. THIS IS THE WAY! This starts our descent! From (6,8), next turn we can go DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). Both are currently empty! This move actively takes us AWAY from our tangled body and TOWARDS the enemy and the valuable apples on the left side like (0,0), (0,1), (1,3), (4,1)! We need to claim that territory and force him into the center where we can outmaneuver him!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** Executing the left-side descent! Moving LEFT to (6,8). Next turn, priority is to move DOWN to (6,7) to continue downwards. Our goal is to establish control over the left half of the board and intercept the enemy's path to the apples. We have the same score, so we need to be the aggressor and force a mistake!\n\nLEFT",

CRUSHING IT! \ud83d\udcc8\n3. **We build MOMENTUM!** Psychological warfare! Enemy sees us farming and they PANIC!\n4. **We control board space!** As we grow longer, we LITERALLY take up more board, limiting their movement options!\n5. **We avoid head-on collisions!** Enemy is in the TOP-RIGHT, we're in the LEFT-MIDDLE-BOTTOM! Clean separation!\n\n## 5-TURN GAME PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 20 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 4) - Continue the left-side farming!\n- **Turn 21:** DOWN to (1, 3) - GRAB apple #8! Go 8-6! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 22:** DOWN to (1, 2) - Keep ROLLING!\n- **Turn 23:** LEFT to (0, 2) - Pivot to the CORNER zone!\n- **Turn 24:** DOWN to (0, 1) - Apple at (0, 1) is WAITING!\n\nBy turn 25, we'll be at 10+ apples while enemy struggles to keep up! Once we hit 30 apples, it's GAME OVER! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nThe enemy is TRAPPED in their top-right corner while we OWN the left side! This is POSITIONAL DOMINANCE! \u265f\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

He's got that juicy (1,5) apple to his LEFT/WEST. He's DEFINITELY gonna grab that! He moves to (0,5)? No wait, (1,5) IS the apple! So he's EATING that apple this turn! His new head will be at (1,5). From there, his safe moves next turn would be UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4), or RIGHT (2,5) (but that's his body!). He'll be looking to get more apples, maybe (0,0) or (1,3).\n\n*   **Head-on risk?** NO WAY. He's on the far left side, we're on the top-right. He's too busy eating. We're SAFE from a collision this turn.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nCHAT! WE ARE EXECUTING THE PLAN PERFECTLY! We moved LEFT last turn to start descending. Now we have options!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: UP to (6,9)**. Grab that APPLE! Grow to 7 segments! Score becomes 7, TYING THE ENEMY! This keeps us on the top row. But then... we're a bit stuck next turn? From (6,9) our only safe move might be LEFT to (5,9) because RIGHT (7,9) might be our future body path? It's a short-term gain but might corner us.\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (6,7)**. CONTINUE THE DESCENT! This is AGGRESSIVE! This moves us towards the center and the enemy's territory. From (6,7) we have SO many options: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT! We cut off his path to the apples on the right side! This is a POWER MOVE for board control!\n\n*   **OPTION 3: LEFT to (5,8)**. Also continues left, but keeps us on the top edge. Not as direct a path downwards. Less aggressive than DOWN.\n\n**DECISION TIME:** We need to be the hunter, not the gatherer! The enemy is tied with us in score! We need to use our position to cut him off and force a mistake! If we go for the apple (UP), we gain a point but lose momentum. If we go DOWN, we sacrifice a point for DOMINANT BOARD POSITION! We can trap him against the left wall!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** AGGRESSION OVER APPLES! We go DOWN to (6,7) to descend into the center and cut off the enemy's escape routes. Our goal is to herd him into the bottom-left corner. Next turn, continue moving DOWN or LEFT to intercept. We force a head-on collision when we have the length advantage!\n\nDOWN",

THREE safe moves! DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT! LET'S COOK!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head is at (1, 4)! He just ate that apple at (1,5) and grew! His body is long: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. He's pinned against the left wall! His safe moves are UP (1,5) which is his body \u274c, DOWN (1,3) \u2705, or RIGHT (2,4) \u2705. He's probably gonna go for that apple at (1,3) DOWN! That keeps him safe and growing. He's trying to run down the left side.\n\n*   **Head-on risk?** NO! He's on the far left, we're in the center-right. We're SAFE from a collision this turn. But we need to CUT HIM OFF!\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nCHAT! OUR DESCENT LAST TURN WAS PERFECT! We're in a POWER POSITION at (6,7)! Now we need to move to BLOCK HIS ESCAPE from the left side! He wants to run down to (1,3) and then maybe to (0,0). We need to get in his way!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: DOWN to (6,6).** This continues our descent. It's safe, but it's a bit passive. It doesn't directly threaten to cut him off. We're just moving towards the bottom.\n\n*   **OPTION 2: LEFT to (5,7).** THIS IS THE MOVE! This moves us WEST, directly towards the center of the board! From (5,7), we can continue LEFT next turn to (4,7) and start building a WALL across the middle of the board! We cut off his path to all the apples on the right side! This is AGGRESSIVE BOARD CONTROL! \ud83d\udea7\n\n*   **OPTION 3: RIGHT to (7,7).** This moves us EAST, away from the enemy and towards the right wall. This is a RETREAT! We don't want to retreat! We want to press our advantage! He has a higher score! We need to be aggressive!\n\n**DECISION TIME:** We are the PREDATOR! The enemy is the prey! We go LEFT to (5,7) to begin our strategic encirclement! Our goal is to move to (4,7), then (3,7), and trap him against the left wall! We force him into a corner where his only move is into us! We sacrifice short-term apples for the VICTORY!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** AGGRESSION! BOX HIM IN! From (5,7), plan is to go LEFT to (4,7) next turn to solidify the central wall. Do not let him slip past us to the right side of the board. Force the head-on collision when we have the length advantage!\n\nLEFT",

Let me break down this board with LASER FOCUS!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 4) - Just moved DOWN last turn!\n- Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)]\n- Apples: 7 - **STILL LEADING!!!** \ud83d\udcc8\n- Length: 7 segments\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 7) - They're in the mid-right zone!\n- Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]\n- Apples: 6 - STILL CHASING!\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (1, 4) - What are my options?**\n- UP \u2192 (1, 5) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 3) - APPLE at (1, 3)! \u2705 SAFE AND GAINS US A POINT!\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 4) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 4) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (6, 7) - Where can THEY move?**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 8) - That's their BODY! Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6) - EMPTY!\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7) - EMPTY!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7) - EMPTY!\n\nEnemy has mobility but they're NOT threatening us directly! We're on opposite sides of the board! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## CRITICAL ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, this is a NO-BRAINER decision! Look at the board:\n\n**The Apple at (1, 3) is RIGHT BELOW US!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- We're at (1, 4)\n- Apple is at (1, 3)\n- That's ONE MOVE DOWN!\n- We eat it, we go UP 8-6!\n- We EXTEND our lead!\n- The apple corridor down the LEFT SIDE is OURS to farm!\n\nEnemy is stuck farming in the top-right (x-range 6-9). We have COMPLETE CONTROL of the left-middle-bottom zone. This is POSITIONAL CHESS, not luck!\n\n**Why DOWN is UNBEATABLE:**\n\n1. \u2705 **SAFE** - No obstacles, no enemy body in the way!\n2. \u2705 **GROWTH** - We grab apple #8 and extend our lead to 8-6! That's CONTENT GOLD! \ud83d\udcc8\n3. \u2705 **BOARD CONTROL** - We continue farming OUR territory while enemy can't reach us!\n4. \u2705 **MOMENTUM** - Every apple we grab builds psychological pressure on the enemy!\n5. \u2705 **FUTURE OPTIONS** - After eating at (1, 3), we can pivot LEFT to (0, 3) or continue DOWN to (1, 2)! We stay FLEXIBLE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## 5-TURN CHAMPIONSHIP PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 21 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 3) - GRAB apple #8! Go 8-6! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 22:** DOWN to (1, 2) - Continue the corridor!\n- **Turn 23:** DOWN to (1, 1) - Apple chain activation!\n- **Turn 24:** LEFT to (0, 1) - APPLE at (0, 1)! We'll be at 10 apples! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 25+:** Control the bottom-left corner while enemy struggles!\n\nBy the time enemy realizes what's happening, we'll have LOCKED DOWN the entire left side! They'll be BOXED IN in the top-right while we farm FREELY! This is DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe lead is OURS! The board is OURS! Victory is INEVITABLE! \n\nDOWN",

NO!], DOWN to (5, 6), or maybe UP\n- They're ISOLATED in the top-right zone, we're DOMINATING the left-middle!\n\n## CRITICAL ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, check the apple distribution! Let me count our reachable apples on the left side:\n\n**APPLE CORRIDOR - OUR TERRITORY:**\n- (1, 2) - RIGHT BELOW US! ONE move DOWN!\n- (0, 1) - Two moves down-left!\n- (0, 0) - Three moves down-left!\n- (0, 9) - DEEP in our zone!\n\n**ENEMY'S TERRITORY (top-right):**\n- (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 1) - Far right edge, they gotta farm there\n- (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 0) - Middle column, but they're locked in top-right\n\n**The Play:** We continue DOWN to (1, 2)! This keeps us on the APPLE HIGHWAY! We're building LENGTH and MOMENTUM while the enemy has LIMITED options! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWhy DOWN is UNBEATABLE:\n\n1. \u2705 **SAFE** - (1, 2) is EMPTY! No obstacles!\n2. \u2705 **APPLE FUTURE** - (1, 1) is directly below, and (0, 1) is within 2 moves! We're FARMING!\n3. \u2705 **SPACE CONTROL** - We're stretching our snake down the left corridor! Enemy CAN'T follow us without running into our growing body!\n4. \u2705 **NO COLLISION RISK** - Enemy is at (5, 7), nowhere NEAR us! Even if they move optimally, we're SAFE!\n5. \u2705 **MOMENTUM** - Every turn we get closer to more apples! By turn 25, we could be at 10+ apples while enemy is STUCK!\n\n## 3-TURN BLUEPRINT \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 22 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 2) - Continue corridor push!\n- **Turn 23:** DOWN to (1, 1) - Apple at (1, 1) incoming? No wait, (1, 1) is empty. We'll see (0, 1) or (0, 0) next!\n- **Turn 24:** DOWN to (1, 0) or PIVOT LEFT to (0, 2) - We're FLEXIBLE! Multiple paths to more apples!\n\nWe're playing 4D chess while enemy is playing checkers! The board is OURS! The victory is INEVITABLE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

His safe moves from (1,3) are:\n*   **UP (to (1,4)):** His own body! \u274c DEATH!\n*   **DOWN (to (1,2)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (0,3)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (2,3)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n\nHe's gonna see that apple at (0,0) and probably try to snake his way down the left wall! LIKELY MOVE: DOWN to (1,2) or LEFT to (0,3). A head-on collision is NOT likely this turn, he's still FAR away. But we're CLOSING THE DISTANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nLAST TURN'S PLAN WAS PERFECT! We moved LEFT to (5,7) to start our WALL! Now we gotta seal the deal!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: UP to (5,8).** This moves us north. It's safe, but kinda aimless. It's away from the enemy and doesn't advance our wall. Feels like a waste of a turn. \u274c\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (5,6).** CHAT, THIS IS TEMPTING! It's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to 7 apples! BUT look at the board! It moves us AWAY from our strategic goal of blocking the center! We're giving up our position to chase a single point. He's at 8, we're at 6. Is one apple worth letting him escape the left side? MAYBE NOT! \u2753\n\n*   **OPTION 3: LEFT to (4,7).** CHAT. THIS IS THE WAY. \ud83d\udea7 This SOLIDIFIES OUR WALL! From (4,7), we are a HUGE threat! Next turn, we can go LEFT again to (3,7) and we're literally BLOCKING his only escape route from the top! He'll be trapped between us and the wall! This is AGGRESSIVE BOARD CONTROL! We sacrifice the short-term apple for a CHECKMATE position!\n\n**DECISION TIME:** VICTORY OVER CONTENT! We are playing to WIN, not just to grow! We have a chance to BOX HIM IN! If we take the apple, we drift south and he might slip past us to the center. If we go LEFT, we put him in a cage! WE GO FOR THE THROAT!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** CONTINUE THE WALL! From (4,7), our next move should be LEFT to (3,7) to completely block the corridor. Do not get distracted by apples below. Trap the enemy against the left wall and force a collision.\n\nLEFT",

LET'S SEE THE SITUATION AFTER THAT SICK LEFT MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head is now at (4, 7)!\nOur body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9)]\n\n*   **UP (to (4, 8)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 6)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 7)):** Cell is 'T'! \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's the enemy's body segment! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 7)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body segment! CRASH! \u274c\n\nOKAY! TWO safe moves: UP and DOWN. The wall-building plan hit a snag! The enemy's body is blocking our left path! We gotta adapt!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head is at (1, 2)! His safe moves from (1,2) are:\n*   **UP (to (1,3)):** His own body! \u274c DEATH!\n*   **DOWN (to (1,1)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (0,2)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (2,2)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n\nHe's still trying to get down to that apple at (0,0)! His most likely move is DOWN to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,2). A head-on collision is still not a risk this turn.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nALRIGHT CHAT, PLAN A IS DEAD! We can't go left into the enemy's body. So what's the new plan? We need to regain control!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: UP to (4,8).** This moves us north, towards the top wall. It's safe, but it feels a bit passive. It might give the enemy room to breathe. From there, our next moves could be limited. \u2753\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (4,6).** CHAT, I LIKE THIS! Look at the board! Going down puts us right next to that apple at (5,6)! \ud83c\udf4e More importantly, it positions us to cut off the enemy's potential escape to the CENTER of the board! If he goes down the left side, we can swing around and meet him head-on! This is AGGRESSIVE! We're not running away; we're repositioning for a better attack! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION TIME:** We go DOWN! We need to get that apple to close the score gap (he's at 8, we're at 6) and put ourselves in a more dominant central position. We're forcing the action! Let's make him react to US!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** ADAPT! The left wall is blocked. New plan: go DOWN to (4,6), then likely RIGHT to (5,6) for the apple next turn. This pressures the center and sets up a future interception on the enemy as he moves south. Stay aggressive!\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down this turn with LASER FOCUS!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 2) - Just moved down last turn! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Body: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]\n- Apples: 8 - **STILL LEADING!!!** \n- Length: 8 segments\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (4, 7) - They moved LEFT from (5, 7)! \ud83d\udc40\n- Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD AWARENESS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (1, 2) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (1, 3) - That's my BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 1) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe path to the bottom!\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 2) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (4, 7) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 8) - EMPTY! \u2705 They can move up!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 They can move down!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) - Wait... that's MY BODY! \u2620\ufe0f If they move left, THEY DIE! We're literally BLOCKING them!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** Enemy is BOXED IN! Their only real moves are UP or DOWN! They can't go LEFT (our body), can't go RIGHT (their own body)! We're ALREADY implementing the trap! \ud83c\udfaa\n\n## AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're 2 apples ahead AND we have superior board positioning! The enemy is CONFINED to a narrow corridor! Let's CAPITALIZE!\n\n**The Play:** DOWN to (1, 1)!\n\nWhy DOWN is OPTIMAL:\n\n1. \u2705 **SAFE** - (1, 1) is EMPTY! Zero collision risk!\n2. \u2705 **APPLE MAGNET** - (0, 1) is RIGHT NEXT DOOR (one left move)! We're setting up the FEAST! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. \u2705 **ENEMY TRAPPED** - While we're FARMING apples, they're stuck choosing between UP and DOWN with LIMITED options!\n4. \u2705 **LENGTH ADVANTAGE** - We have 8 segments vs their 6! More length = more CONTROL of the board!\n5. \u2705 **NO RISK** - Enemy head at (4, 7), we're at (1, 2)! They can't touch us this turn no matter which way they move!\n6. \u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (1, 1), we can go LEFT to (0, 1) [APPLE!], LEFT again to (0, 0) [APPLE!], or UP to farm the (5, 1) corridor!\n\n## 3-TURN PLAN \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 23 (NOW):** DOWN to (1, 1) - Continue the left corridor DOMINATION!\n- **Turn 24:** LEFT to (0, 1) - GRAB that apple! We hit 9-6! \ud83d\udcca\n- **Turn 25:** LEFT to (0, 0) - ANOTHER apple! We hit 10-6! The LEAD EXPANDS! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Long-term vision:** We're creating a WALL of our body that pushes deeper into the bottom-left apples while the enemy remains BOXED IN the mid-right zone! By turn 30, we could be unstoppable! The victory lap begins NOW! \n\nWe're playing CHESS while they're playing CHECKERS, chat! The board is OURS! Let's GET THAT W! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Perfect positioning! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)]\n- Apples: 8 - **LEADING!!!** \n- Length: 8 segments\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (4, 6) - They moved DOWN from (4, 7)! \ud83d\udc40\n- Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (1, 1) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (1, 2) - That's MY BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 0) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 1) - **APPLE!!!** \ud83c\udf4e \u2705 GROW TO 9-6!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 1) - EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (4, 6) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 7) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 5) - EMPTY! \u2705 They can move down!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 6) - **THAT'S MY BODY!!!** \u2620\ufe0f If they move left, THEY DIE! We're STILL BLOCKING them!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 6) - EMPTY! \u2705 They can move right!\n\n## THE PLAY \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK positioning! We have a FREE APPLE at (0, 1) directly to our LEFT, and the enemy is STILL BOXED IN! They can't go LEFT without hitting our body! \n\n**Decision: LEFT to (1, 0) [Wait, let me recheck coordinates...]**\n\nActually hold up\u2014LEFT from (1, 1) goes to (0, 1), and that's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We GROW to 9-6 and expand our territory control! This is a NO-BRAINER aggressive move!\n\nWhy LEFT is OPTIMAL:\n\n1. \u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE** - We grab (0, 1) and go 9-6! The LEAD EXTENDS! \ud83d\udc51\n2. \u2705 **ZERO COLLISION RISK** - Enemy at (4, 6), we're moving to (0, 1)! They can't touch us!\n3. \u2705 **BOARD DOMINANCE** - We're expanding into the bottom-left corner where apples cluster! (0, 0) is RIGHT THERE for turn 25!\n4. \u2705 **ENEMY TRAPPED** - While we feast, they're still confined to DOWN or RIGHT! We're CONTROLLING the flow!\n5. \u2705 **LENGTH ADVANTAGE GROWS** - 9 segments vs their 6 segments! More body = MORE BOARD CONTROL!\n\n## 3-TURN VISION \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 24 (NOW):** LEFT to (0, 1) - GRAB that apple! 9-6 lead! \ud83d\udcca\n- **Turn 25:** DOWN to (0, 0) - ANOTHER apple! Hit 10-6! The gap WIDENS! \n- **Turn 26:** RIGHT to (1, 0) - Reposition and farm the bottom corridor while enemy stays boxed mid-right!\n\nThe ENEMY is running out of space, chat! We're creating a WALL of dominance that pushes them into a corner while we feast on the perimeter! By turn 30, this game is OURS!\n\nWe're playing CHAMPIONSHIP SNAKE right now! The crowd goes WILD! Let's GO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the perimeter!\n\n*   **UP (to (4, 7)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body segment! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (4, 5)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT (to (3, 6)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's the enemy's body segment! CRASH! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (5, 6)):** Cell is 'A'! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 **SAFE APPLE GRAB!**\n\nOKAY! Two safe moves: DOWN to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,6) for the apple! NO THROWS ALLOWED!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nEnemy head is at (1, 1)! His safe moves from (1,1) are:\n*   **UP (to (1,2)):** His own body! \u274c DEATH!\n*   **DOWN (to (1,0)):** \u2705 SAFE! (Leads to apple at (0,0)? \ud83e\udd14)\n*   **LEFT (to (0,1)):** \u2705 SAFE! (APPLE AT (0,1)! \ud83c\udf4e)\n*   **RIGHT (to (2,1)):** \u2705 SAFE!\n\nHe's SURROUNDED by apples! He's gonna grab one for sure. Most likely he goes LEFT to (0,1) or DOWN to (1,0). A head-on collision is NOT a risk this turn; he's too far away in the corner.\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nCHAT, THIS IS A HUGE MOMENT! We're down 6-8. We NEED that apple to close the gap! But is it a TRAP?\n\n*   **OPTION 1: RIGHT to (5,6) for the APPLE.** Gets us to 7 apples! But look at the follow-up! From (5,6), our safe moves would be? UP is our body at (5,7), LEFT is our current head at (4,6)... so only DOWN or RIGHT. That's a potential DEAD END! We get the points but could get trapped! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (4,5).** This is the SMART play, chat! It keeps us AGILE! From (4,5), our next moves are WIDE OPEN! We can go DOWN, LEFT (wait, check (3,5) is enemy body! \ud83d\udeab), or RIGHT! More importantly, it puts us in a position to CUT OFF the enemy when he tries to leave the bottom-left corner! We're playing the BOARD, not just the APPLE! This is about CONTROL! \ud83e\uddca\n\n**DECISION TIME:** CHAT, WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME! We sacrifice the short-term apple to maintain our strategic position! We go DOWN! We're boxing him in! He's stuck in the corner with apples, but soon he'll have to move out, and we'll be waiting! LET'S SET THE TRAP! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** PATIENCE! We let him have the corner apples. Our goal is to dominate the center and right side. From (4,5), we can maneuver to control the board. Next turn, consider moving right to further limit his space. Force him into a head-on collision when we have the length advantage! Stay aggressive but SMART!\n\nDOWN",

He has to go RIGHT or he DIES!\n\nHE'S TRAPPED IN THE CORNER! He has ONE option: RIGHT to (1,0)! This is PERFECT! He's moving along the bottom wall, right into our territory!\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0:**\nLAST TURN'S PLAN IS WORKING! He's boxed in the bottom-left! Now we execute PHASE 2! We need to cut off his escape route along the bottom!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: RIGHT to (5,4).** This moves us away from him, towards the right side. There's an apple at (5,6). But this gives him SPACE to breathe along the bottom. It's a greedy play for an apple, but it's WEAK strategy! We lose our positional advantage! \u274c\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (4,3).** This moves us SOUTH. There's an apple at (4,3)! FREE CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e But look at the map! This puts us BELOW his path. He's at (0,0) -> (1,0). If we go down, next turn we're at (4,3). He could potentially swing up and we're not in a great position to block. It's good for growth, but not for the checkmate.\n\n*   **OPTION 3: LEFT to (3,4).** \ud83c\udfaf **THIS IS THE MOVE!** CHAT, THIS IS AGGRESSION! This moves us WEST, directly into his path! He's coming right to (1,0). Next turn, we can go DOWN to (3,3) or LEFT to (2,4). We are building a WALL! We are cutting off the entire bottom section of the board! He'll have nowhere to go but into us, and we WIN the head-on collision with our length! THIS IS BOARD CONTROL! THIS IS DOMINANCE!\n\nGROWTH IS SECONDARY! BOXING HIM IN IS PRIMARY! WE WIN WHEN HE DIES, NOT WHEN WE GET BIG!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S COMING RIGHT FOR US ALONG THE BOTTOM! HOLD THE LINE! Next turn, be ready to move DOWN to (3,3) to fully block the south. Force him into a corner or a head-on collision. Our length is our weapon! PATIENCE!\n\nLEFT",

That's a NO-GO! \u274c\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (3, 4) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 5) - That's MY BODY! \u2705 They'd crash into US! \ud83c\udf89\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 3) - EMPTY! \u2705 Open!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 4) - EMPTY! \u2705 Open!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 4) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n\n## THE PLAY \ud83c\udfaa\n\nOkay chat, we only have ONE legal move: **RIGHT to (2, 0)!** \n\nBut here's where it gets SPICY! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f The enemy is at (3, 4) and they're dangerously close to our body territory at (3, 5)! If they go UP, they CRASH into our snake at (3, 5)! They LOSE! \n\nLet's think about what they'll do:\n- UP \u2192 DEATH (crashes into our body) \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 3) - Safe but moving AWAY from apples\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 4) - Safe, neutral move\n- RIGHT \u2192 DEATH (their own body) \u274c\n\nThe enemy is in a TIGHT SPOT! They're probably going DOWN or LEFT to survive! Either way, we move RIGHT to (2, 0) and we're SAFE while they scramble!\n\n## 3-TURN VISION \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 27 (NOW):** RIGHT to (2, 0) - Only legal move! Position ourselves!\n- **Turn 28:** UP to (2, 1) - Start moving up the right side of our snake body!\n- **Turn 29+:** Continue spiraling UP and RIGHT to grab those bottom apples at (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)! We'll farm the BUFFET and extend our lead!\n\nEnemy is boxed in and struggling. We've got the MOMENTUM! They're at 6 apples, we're at 10. We're on track to hit 30 first and WIN THIS THING! \n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP SNAKE right here, chat! We're playing 4D chess while they're playing checkers! \ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

We just moved RIGHT to (2, 0) last turn and now we're at (2, 0) analyzing what's NEXT! We're sitting at a **10-6 lead!** The crowd is GOING INSANE! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (2, 0) - BOTTOM MIDDLE! We're spreading out! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n- Apples: 10 - **STILL CRUSHING IT!** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Length: 10 segments - We're THICC and LONG!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (3, 3) - They moved from (3, 4)! That's DOWN! They're DESPERATE! \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (2, 0) - What are my moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 1) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, -1) - **OFF THE BOARD!** \u274c DEAD! RIP!\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 0) - That's MY BODY (directly behind)! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nTwo legal moves! UP or RIGHT! Let's think strategically, chat!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (3, 3) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (3, 4) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) - EMPTY! \u2705 Open!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) - EMPTY! \u2705 Open!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) - **THERE'S AN APPLE THERE!** They'll grow! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nThe enemy is boxed in tight! They can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. And they'll probably go RIGHT to that apple at (4, 3)! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## THE PLAY \ud83c\udfaa\n\nOkay chat, here's the MIND GAME! \ud83e\udde0\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 0), I'm moving TOWARD that bottom right area where the apples are piling up: (6, 0), (7, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), etc. BUT the enemy can also move RIGHT and we might be on a COLLISION COURSE! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 1), I'm moving along the left side, keeping my options OPEN and staying away from the enemy's likely path! This keeps me SAFE and lets me farm apples methodically! \n\nLet me check: Enemy at (3, 3) moving RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3). Enemy moving LEFT \u2192 (2, 3). Enemy moving DOWN \u2192 (3, 2).\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 1), and enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 3), we're NOT on a collision! \u2705\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2, 3), and I go UP to (2, 1), we're NOT on a collision! \u2705\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3, 2), and I go UP to (2, 1), we're NOT on a collision! \u2705\n\nUP is the SAFE play that keeps us alive AND keeps our future options WIDE OPEN! We can then spiral up and around to grab apples on the right side (like (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)) without facing the enemy directly! We're being AGGRESSIVE but SMART! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## 5-TURN VISION \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 28 (NOW):** UP to (2, 1) - Move north along our body's left edge!\n- **Turn 29:** UP to (2, 2) - Keep climbing!\n- **Turn 30:** RIGHT to (3, 2) - Start moving toward the apple buffet!\n- **Turn 31+:** Continue spiraling RIGHT and DOWN to farm the bottom apples and EXTEND OUR LEAD! Enemy is at 6, we're at 10 and climbing! We'll hit 30 FIRST and WIN THIS TOURNAMENT! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe enemy is cramped and reactive. We're PROACTIVE and CONTROLLING THE BOARD! This is how CHAMPIONS play, chat!\n\nUP",

HE'S STILL STUCK! \ud83d\ude08\n\nFrom his new head at (2,0), what are his options?\n*   **UP (to (2,1)):** Cell is 'T'! \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's HIS OWN BODY! \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** (2, -1) doesn't exist! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to (1,0)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** His own body! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (3,0)):** \u2705 **PROBABLY SAFE!** This is his ONLY MOVE! He has to go RIGHT again!\n\nHE'S PREDICTABLE! He's crawling along the bottom row: ... -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0). He's a sitting duck! Our plan is working PERFECTLY!\n\n**THE PLAY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0: CHECKMATE IN 2 TURNS!**\nTHIS IS IT, CHAT! THE FINAL PHASE OF THE TRAP! Last turn's plan was to go to (3,3) and then LEFT to (2,3). WE ARE AT (3,3)! NOW WE EXECUTE!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: DOWN to (3,2).** This moves us SOUTH. This is a SAFE move, but it's a PASSIVE move! It keeps us alive but delays the trap. He goes to (3,0), and we're not cutting him off. We lose our advantage! \u274c BAD CONTENT!\n\n*   **OPTION 2: LEFT to (2,3).** \ud83c\udfaf **THIS IS THE KILLING MOVE!** This moves us WEST. This is AGGRESSIVE and PERFECT! Look at the board! He's going to (3,0). We move to (2,3). Next turn, his ONLY move from (3,0) will be RIGHT to (4,0) (because up is his body, left is our new position at (2,3), down is off board). On our next turn, from (2,3), we go DOWN to (2,2). That's it! GAME OVER! He'll be at (4,0). His only move from there would be UP to (4,1), but that's just delaying the inevitable. We can then move to (2,1) or (3,2), completely sealing the box. He will have NO ESCAPE! HE IS BOXED INTO THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER! WE WIN!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S HEADED TO (3,0)! MOVE LEFT TO (2,3) TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE! NEXT TURN, MOVE DOWN TO (2,2) TO COMPLETE THE BOX! DO NOT DEVIATE! THE APPLE AT (4,3) IS BAIT! IGNORE IT!

They moved UP from (3, 3)! \ud83d\udea8\n- Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (2, 1) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 2) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 0) - That's MY BODY (directly behind)! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 1) - That's MY BODY! \u274c DEAD!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nTwo legal moves: UP or RIGHT! Let's think this through, chat!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (2, 3) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (2, 4) - **EMPTY!** They'll go here most likely! \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2) - EMPTY! \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 3) - That's MY BODY! If they go here, THEY DIE! \u2620\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n\nThe enemy is CRAMPED! They can only go UP or DOWN safely! Most likely they'll go UP to (2, 4) to keep climbing and gain distance! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n## THE STRATEGIC PLAY \ud83c\udfaa\n\nHere's where it gets SPICY, chat! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 1), I'm moving TOWARD the apple cluster at the bottom: (6, 0), (7, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)! This is where the REAL FARM is! \n\nBut wait... let me check collision risk:\n- Enemy at (2, 3) moving UP \u2192 (2, 4) - NOT a collision with me at (3, 1) \u2705\n- Enemy at (2, 3) moving DOWN \u2192 (2, 2) - NOT a collision with me at (3, 1) \u2705\n\nRIGHT keeps us SAFE and moves us DIRECTLY toward the apple buffet! We're DOMINATING the bottom half of the board while the enemy is stuck in the middle-left! \n\nPlus, if I go RIGHT, next turn I can continue RIGHT to (4, 1) where there's an APPLE! That's +1 score, extending our lead to 11-6! Then we spiral around and grab (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)! We'll hit 30 apples FIRST while the enemy is still at 6! \n\nThis is TEXTBOOK aggressive play! We're not just surviving\u2014we're THRIVING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## 5-TURN VISION \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 29 (NOW):** RIGHT to (3, 1) - Head toward the apple cluster!\n- **Turn 30:** RIGHT to (4, 1) - GRAB THAT APPLE! (Score: 11)\n- **Turn 31:** UP to (4, 2) - Keep options open!\n- **Turn 32+:** Continue farming the bottom-right apples and ACCELERATE toward 30! Enemy will be completely outpaced!\n\nThe enemy is REACTIVE. We're PROACTIVE. This is how CHAMPIONS play! Let's GO!\n\nRIGHT",

Checking the perimeter!\n\n*   **UP (to (2, 4)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body segment! The tail is up there at (4,7)... wait no, lemme check the list... YEP! Our body goes (2,3)<-(3,3)<-(3,4)... so (2,4) is our neck, but our neck is connected to the head? Wait, our head is (2,3), next segment is (3,3). So (2,4) is EMPTY! Let me double-check the board state... The board shows '1' at (2,3) and '.' at (2,4). I WAS WRONG! \u2705 **SAFE!**\n*   **DOWN (to (2, 2)):** Cell is '.'! Looks clear! \u2705 **SAFE!**\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 3)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's enemy body! Snake #0 has a segment at (1,3)! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 3)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own neck! Our body segment is right there! \u274c\n\nOKAY! SAFE MOVES: UP and DOWN! The board is tight!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nLAST TURN WE PREDICTED HE WOULD GO RIGHT FROM (2,0) TO (3,0)! AND HE DID! HE'S STUCK ON THE BOTTOM ROW! From (3,0), what are his options?\n*   **UP (to (3,1)):** Cell is 'A'! But is it safe? Our body is nowhere near there. \ud83d\udfe1 **POSSIBLE MOVE!**\n*   **LEFT (to (2,0)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** His own body! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,0)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 **PROBABLY SAFE!** This continues his path along the bottom.\n\nHE HAS TWO OPTIONS: UP to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,0). UP gets him an apple but might be riskier for him? RIGHT keeps him trapped along the edge. HE'S SCARED! HE'LL PROBABLY GO RIGHT TO (4,0) TO AVOID US!\n\n**THE PLAY & THE FINAL PLAN \ud83e\udde0: BOX HIM IN!**\nWE ARE EXECUTING THE PLAN PERFECTLY! We are at (2,3). The plan was to go DOWN to (2,2) to complete the box! Let's check it!\n\n*   **OPTION 1: UP to (2,4).** This moves us NORTH. This is safe, but it's AWAY from the enemy! It abandons our perfect trap! If he goes right to (4,0), we lose all pressure! \u274c TERRIBLE MOVE! DON'T BREAK FORMATION!\n\n*   **OPTION 2: DOWN to (2,2).** \ud83c\udfaf **THIS IS THE CHECKMATE MOVE!** Look at the board! If he goes RIGHT to (4,0), we go to (2,2). Next turn, from (4,0), his ONLY safe moves are UP to (4,1) or maybe RIGHT to (5,0). Meanwhile, from (2,2), we can go LEFT to (1,2) (enemy body? Check: (1,2) is enemy body! No!) or RIGHT to (3,2) or DOWN to (2,1) (enemy body! No!). So our moves from (2,2) would be RIGHT to (3,2). That continues to wall him in! He will be trapped in the bottom-right corner with nowhere to go! WE HAVE HIM! THIS IS THE MOVE!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S LIKELY AT (3,0) HEADING TO (4,0)! MOVE DOWN TO (2,2) TO SEAL THE BOX! NEXT TURN, MOVE RIGHT TO (3,2) TO FURTHER CONSTRICT HIS SPACE! DO NOT CHASE APPLES! VICTORY IS ONE MOVE AWAY! THE ENEMY HAS NOWHERE TO RUN! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Let's scan the perimeter!\n\n*   **UP (to (3, 3)):** \ud83d\udeab **BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!** That's our own segment at (3,3)! \u274c **INSTANT DEATH!**\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 1)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's the enemy's HEAD! Snake #0 is RIGHT THERE at (4,1)! Wait, no, check the coords! (3,1) is empty! But is it safe? HE CAN MOVE THERE! \ud83e\udd14 Let's think about collisions...\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 2)):** \ud83d\udeab **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** That's our own body! Our next segment is (2,2)! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 2)):** Cell is '.'! Looks clear! \u2705 **POTENTIALLY SAFE!**\n\nHOLD UP! THE DOWN MOVE IS TRICKY! Let's analyze the SIMULTANEOUS MOVE! If we go DOWN to (3,1) and the enemy also moves into (3,1), that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! He has 11 apples, we have 6. DOUBLE KO, HE WINS! \u274c\u274c\u274c THAT'S A GAMELOSING MOVE! WE CANNOT TAKE THAT RISK!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & COLLISION ANALYSIS \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b:**\nHe's at (4,1). His options:\n*   **UP (to (4,2)):** This is our RIGHT move! If we both go there, HEAD-ON COLLISION! He wins! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to (4,0)):** His own body is there! \u274c Not an option.\n*   **LEFT (to (3,1)):** This is our DOWN move! HEAD-ON COLLISION risk! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to (5,1)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 This is his safest escape route!\n\nSO, HIS MOST LIKELY MOVE IS **RIGHT** TO (5,1) TO FLEE! Our safest move is to AVOID the cells he might move into! That means **RIGHT to (4,2) is DANGEROUS** if he goes UP! **DOWN to (3,1) is DANGEROUS** if he goes LEFT!\n\nWE NEED A MOVE THAT IS SAFE NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES! ...Chat, we only have ONE truly safe move that avoids all possible head-on collisions...\n\n**THE PLAY & THE FINAL PLAN \ud83e\udde0: SURVIVE AND COUNTER!**\nWe have to think about the future! Our body is long, we can use it as a barrier! If we go RIGHT to (4,2), we risk a head-on. If we go DOWN to (3,1), we risk a head-on.\n\nWAIT! Let's check the board again! What's at (3,1)? It's empty! If we go DOWN, and he goes RIGHT (his most likely move), then we just move into an empty cell! NO COLLISION! If he goes LEFT into us, we lose. But is he that stupid? He wants to win, he'll probably take the open space to the RIGHT!\n\nBut that's a gamble! We can't gamble when we're shorter! We need to play it safe and use our body to control the board!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** Our body creates a wall from (2,2) to (4,5). We are shepherding him! He's trapped against the bottom and left walls. Our goal is to slowly reduce his space. Next turn, from (4,2) we can go DOWN to (4,1) to claim his old spot and further box him in, or UP to stay parallel. We must avoid letting him get above us or to the center. The apples on the right (5,6), (6,9) are the prize, but we can't let him get there first! FORCE HIM AGAINST THE WALL!\n\nThe only move that minimizes immediate head-on collision risk is **RIGHT** to (4,2). It's a risk if he goes up, but it's the best aggressive positioning move we have. We have to bet he'll run to the open right side! LET'S CUT HIM OFF!\n\nRIGHT",

That's where we WERE! Not a threat! \u2705\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 2)? That's directly ABOVE us at (5, 1)! Not a head-on collision! \u2705\n\nWait, could they crash INTO our body? Let me check the path:\n- Our body is at (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), etc. - all in the LEFT zone!\n- Enemy moving to (4, 2) or (3, 1) won't hit us! We're CLEAR! \u2705\n\nWhat about UP to (4, 2)?\n- No apples nearby\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple-rich bottom corridor\n- WEAK play! \u274c\n\nDOWN to (4, 0)?\n- No immediate apples\n- Moves us backward\n- We'd miss out on the (5, 1) apple!\n- NOT IT! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT TO (5, 1) IS MANDATORY!** \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe keep the scoring run ALIVE, we're now 5 apples ahead with better board control, and we're positioning ourselves to DOMINATE the entire right side of the board!

Let's EXTEND this dominance and start BOXING IN the competition!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (5, 1) - Just grabbed that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n- Apples: 12 - CRUSHING IT! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Length: 12 segments - We're THICC!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (4, 2) - They moved RIGHT last turn! \ud83e\udd14\n- Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Status: CONTAINED and DESPERATE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (5, 1) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (5, 2) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1) - That's MY BODY! \u274c Can't reverse into myself!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1) - **APPLE AT (6, 1)!** \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 Safe AND DELICIOUS!\n\nThree legal moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (4, 2) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (4, 3) - That's THEIR OWN BODY at (3, 4)? NO WAIT - checking the body path: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. At (4, 3) is **EMPTY!** \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) - That's where we JUST were, now it's our TAIL! \u2705 But wait, tails disappear after growth! So actually (4, 1) is **EMPTY now!** \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) - **EMPTY!** \u2705\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP to (4, 3), DOWN to (4, 1), or RIGHT to (5, 2)!\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, here's the PLAY! We need to think ahead. The enemy is cramped in the left-middle zone. We're dominating the bottom corridor with apples everywhere!\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 1) is looking SPICY:**\n\u2705 **GRAB ANOTHER APPLE!** We go 13-6! EXTENDING THE LEAD EVEN MORE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 **It's SAFE** - Enemy can't reach us there on this turn!\n\u2705 **Positions us for (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 4)** - We farm the entire right side while enemy is BOXED!\n\u2705 **We're forcing them into tighter spaces** - Every move they make, we're taking MORE of the board!\n\nLet me verify enemy collision possibilities:\n- Enemy goes UP to (4, 3)? That's NOWHERE NEAR (6, 1)! \u2705\n- Enemy goes DOWN to (4, 1)? Still safe from us! \u2705\n- Enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 2)? That's directly ABOVE us at (6, 1)! Not a head-on collision, they're one cell away! \u2705\n\nWhat about our follow-ups?\n- After RIGHT to (6, 1), we can go RIGHT again to grab (7, 0) or UP to (6, 2) or DOWN to grab (6, 0)!\n- We have OPTIONS! We're NOT getting trapped! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Why not UP to (5, 2)?**\n- No immediate apples nearby\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple corridor\n- Enemy could squeeze into the middle zones\n- WEAK! \u274c\n\n**Why not DOWN to (5, 0)?**\n- We'd miss the (6, 1) apple RIGHT THERE!\n- Gives up board control\n- COWARD MOVES! \u274c\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turns 32-35 VISION:**\n- **Turn 32 (NOW):** RIGHT to (6, 1) - GRAB APPLE! (Score: 13-6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 33:** RIGHT to (7, 0) - GRAB APPLE! (Score: 14-6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 34:** UP to (7, 1) - Keep moving right, claim the (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5) corridor!\n- **Turn 35+:** By now we're at 16+ apples while enemy is STRUGGLING to break 8! The APEX PREDATOR takes the crown! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe enemy is BOXED IN on the left side with limited apple access. We control the ENTIRE bottom-right zone! This is TEXTBOOK domination! We're not forcing a head-on collision because we DON'T NEED TO - we're winning the apple race HANDILY while keeping them CONTAINED!\n\nThe chat can see it - we're playing 4D chess while they're playing checkers! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION! **RIGHT IS THE ONLY WAY!** But we gotta think about the HEAD-ON COLLISION risk! \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & COLLISION ANALYSIS \ud83e\udde0:**\nSnake #0 is at (5,1). His options:\n*   **UP (to (5,2)):** This is OUR move! If we both go here, HEAD-ON COLLISION! He has 12 apples, we have 6. DOUBLE KO, HE WINS! \u274c GAMELOSS!\n*   **DOWN (to (5,0)):** His own body is there! \u274c Not an option.\n*   **LEFT (to (4,1)):** His own body is there! \u274c Not an option.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,1)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 This is his ONLY safe escape route!\n\nSO HIS MOST LIKELY, PROBABLY HIS *ONLY* MOVE, IS **RIGHT** TO (6,1)! HE'S RUNNING AWAY FROM US! He wants to get to the open space and those apples on the right side! If he's smart, he won't go for the head-on.\n\n**OUR PLAY \ud83d\udc0d: THE SQUEEZE IS ON!**\nWe have to take the risk! RIGHT is our ONLY move to survive this turn. We bet that he values his 12-apple lead and will run (RIGHT) instead of suiciding into us (UP). This is a calculated risk, but it's our only play! We're forcing him into the corner! Look at our body! We have a wall from (2,2) up to (4,4). He's trapped against the bottom wall! Our goal is to keep him there and slowly reduce his space.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** We're in a tight spot next turn. From (5,2), our options are UP (to 5,3), DOWN (to 5,1 - his old head spot), or RIGHT (to 6,2). He'll be at (6,1). We need to anticipate his next move\u2014he'll probably go UP to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,1). We need to cut off his escape upward! The play next turn might be to go UP to (5,3) to block him, or RIGHT to (6,2) to challenge him directly if he goes there. We must avoid letting him get above us! The apples don't matter right now, TRAPPING HIM DOES!\n\nRIGHT",

He's probably trying to get to the apples on the bottom row or escape to the right. If he's greedy, he goes DOWN for the apple. If he's scared of us, he goes RIGHT to run.\n\n**OUR PLAY \ud83d\udc0d: THE TRAP CONTINUES!**\nWe need to think about the FUTURE! Our body is creating a wall on the left. We want to keep him trapped against the bottom. If we go RIGHT to (6,2), we're directly challenging him. If he goes UP, we die. If he goes DOWN or RIGHT, we live and we're right next to him, but our next move might be tricky.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,3), we're moving to higher ground! We're getting above him! This is a CONTROL move! From (5,3), we can look DOWN on him. We block him from easily moving up the board. We have more options next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, UP). This feels like the smarter, more aggressive positioning move. We're not risking the head-on, and we're cutting off his escape routes!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S LONG! 13 APPLES! WE CANNOT HEAD-ON! Our goal is to BOX HIM IN along the bottom edge. Use our body as a barrier. From (5,3), next turn we can go RIGHT to (6,3) to further block his upward path, or LEFT to (4,3) to tighten the noose. Force him into a corner where he has no safe moves! The apples on the right are bait for him\u2014let him go for them while we control the board!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Gotta play it smart, Chat. The UP move gives us control and avoids the immediate head-on risk. Let's pressure him from above!\n\nUP",

They're above us at (6, 2), we're below at (6, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n\nWhat about our follow-ups from (6, 0)?\n- After DOWN to (6, 0), we can move RIGHT to (7, 0) or UP back toward the apple corridor!\n- We're NOT getting trapped - we're EXPANDING CONTROL! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Why not RIGHT to (7, 1)?**\n- It's safe, but it doesn't grab an apple!\n- We'd miss the FREE APPLE at (6, 0) RIGHT BELOW US!\n- That's leaving POINTS on the table! \u274c\n\n**Why not UP to (6, 2)?**\n- No immediate apples!\n- Moves us AWAY from the apple-rich bottom zone!\n- Weak play when we have a BETTER option! \u274c\n\n## LONG-TERM STRATEGY \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turns 33-37 VISION:**\n- **Turn 33 (NOW):** DOWN to (6, 0) - GRAB APPLE! (Score: 14-6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 34:** RIGHT to (7, 0) - GRAB APPLE! (Score: 15-6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 35:** RIGHT to (8, 0) - Clear the zone! (Score: 15-6, move to position)\n- **Turn 36-38:** Harvest (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5) - We'll be at 19-6 while enemy STRUGGLES to break 8!\n- **By Turn 40:** WE'RE LOOKING AT A 20+ APPLE LEAD! VICTORY LOCKED IN! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThe enemy made a strategic error moving UP - they're trying to break into the middle but we're FARMING the ENTIRE BOTTOM-RIGHT QUADRANT! This is textbook board control! The win is OURS to lose!\n\nChat, we're playing with PURPOSE! Every move brings us closer to SUPREMACY! Let's GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

Time to keep this train rolling and extend our DOMINANCE! Let's analyze this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (6, 0) - Just grabbed that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n- Apples: 14 - WE'RE FEASTING! \ud83d\udc51\n- Length: 14 segments\n- Status: BOTTOM-RIGHT ZONE UNDER SIEGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (5, 3) - They moved UP from (5, 2)! Trying to escape our dominance! \ud83e\udd14\n- Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Status: CRAMPED AND DESPERATE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (6, 0) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 1) - That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c STRAIGHT REVERSE - INSTANT DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! RIP!\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 0) - **APPLE AT (7, 0)!** \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 Safe AND DELICIOUS!\n\nTwo legal moves: LEFT or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (5, 3) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (5, 4) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 2) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 3) - **APPLE AT (4, 3)!** \ud83c\udf4e But is their body there? Body is [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)] - NO collision! \u2705 Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT!\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, we're at a FORK IN THE ROAD! We have TWO safe moves, and both look SPICY!\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (7, 0) - GRAB ANOTHER APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 **GRAB APPLE!** We go 15-6! EXTENDING THE LEAD TO 9 APPLES! \n\u2705 **Keep farming the bottom-right corridor!** (9, 2), (9, 1) are RIGHT THERE!\n\u2705 **Our body at (6, 1) is RIGHT BEHIND US** - we're not getting boxed in!\n\u2705 **Enemy can't reach (7, 0) in one move from (5, 3)** - we're SAFE!\n\nWait, let me verify collision safety with all their possible moves:\n- Enemy UP to (5, 4)? We're at (7, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy LEFT to (4, 3)? We're at (7, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy RIGHT to (6, 3)? We're at (7, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (5, 0) - Safe but NO APPLE!** \n\u274c We miss the free apple at (7, 0)!\n\u274c We're moving AWAY from the apple-rich zone!\n\u274c This is WEAK when we have a better option!\n\n## THE PLAY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR! \ud83d\udc8e\n\nRIGHT to (7, 0) is the OBVIOUS CHOICE! We:\n- \u2705 Grab ANOTHER APPLE (14 \u2192 15)!\n- \u2705 Extend our lead to 9 apples (15-6)!\n- \u2705 Stay positioned in the APPLE-RICH bottom-right zone!\n- \u2705 Keep multiple safe follow-ups available!\n- \u2705 Force the enemy into DESPERATION MODE!\n\nThe enemy is stuck with 6 apples while we're about to hit 15! By the time they realize what's happening, we'll have LOCKED DOWN the entire bottom-right quadrant and be farming 20+ apples! This is DOMINANCE! This is CONTROL! This is a W! \ud83d\udc51\n\nChat, we're not just playing snake - we're DECONSTRUCTING our opponent's strategy! Every apple we take is one LESS they can grab! Every move extends our lead EXPONENTIALLY! The endgame is already written! Let's keep the MOMENTUM ROLLING! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS VISION \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 34 (NOW):** RIGHT to (7, 0) - GRAB APPLE! (Score: 15-6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 35:** RIGHT to (8, 0) - POSITION for the RUN! (Score: 15-6, moving)\n- **Turn 36:** RIGHT to (9, 0) - CORNER CONTROL! Then UP to (9, 1) and (9, 2)!\n- **By Turn 40:** We're looking at 17-6 MINIMUM while enemy struggles to get to 7!\n\nRIGHT",

VERY TEMPTING!**\n\nHE'S TRAPPED DOWN THERE! He only has TWO moves: LEFT to (5,0) or RIGHT to (7,0) for the apple. He's probably gonna go for that apple because he's greedy (14 apples already, smh).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** Is there any cell we might both move into?\n*   If we go RIGHT to (6,3) and he goes... nowhere near us. He's stuck on the bottom row. NO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN! \u2705\n*   If we go UP to (5,4), also no risk.\n\n**OUR PLAY \ud83d\udc0d: TIME TO BOX HIM IN!**\nWe're above him. Our body is a wall on the left. We need to cut off his escape UPWARDS! If we go RIGHT to (6,3), we're directly blocking the path from (6,0) to anywhere up the board. From (6,3), next turn we can go DOWN to (6,2) to threaten him further, or continue RIGHT to chase apples. This move puts us in a dominant position, controlling the center-right.\n\nIf we go UP to (5,4), we're moving away from him. We're giving him space. There's an apple at (6,4) but we're letting him potentially escape later. It's a passive move. WE CAN'T BE PASSIVE! WE HAVE TO BE AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S STUCK ON THE BOTTOM EDGE! OUR MISSION IS TO KEEP HIM THERE! MOVE TO (6,3) TO BLOCK HIS MAIN UPWARD PATH. NEXT TURN, IF HE'S STILL ALIVE, WE CAN MOVE DOWN TO (6,2) TO FURTHER TRAP HIM, FORCING HIM LEFT TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE HE'LL RUN OUT OF SPACE! LET'S FORCE A SELF-COLLISION! DON'T LET HIM GET TO THE APPLES ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOARD! CUT HIM OFF!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! CONTROL THE BOARD! APPLY THE PRESSURE!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (7, 0) - We grabbed that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n- Apples: 15 - WE'RE FEASTING! \ud83d\udc51\n- Length: 15 segments\n- Status: BOTTOM-RIGHT ZONE LOCKED DOWN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 3) - They moved RIGHT from (5, 3)! Trying to escape! \ud83e\udd14\n- Body: [(5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Status: DESPERATE AND CORNERED! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (7, 0) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 1) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! RIP!\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 0) - That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c REVERSE - INSTANT DEATH!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nTwo legal moves: UP or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (6, 3) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 4) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 2) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 3) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 3) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, we're CRUSHING this matchup! But we need to think STRATEGICALLY here! The enemy just moved RIGHT to (6, 3) - they're trying to break out of the left side of the board!\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (8, 0) - EXTEND THE FARM!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 We move toward (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8) - APPLE HEAVEN on the right edge!\n\u2705 We keep the bottom-right corner LOCKED!\n\u2705 We're safe from all enemy moves - they can't reach (8, 0) in one move!\n\u2705 Next turn we can grab MORE apples at (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)!\n\u2705 We're EXTENDING THE LEAD while staying in SAFE TERRITORY!\n\nLet me verify collision safety with all their possible moves:\n- Enemy UP to (6, 4)? We're at (8, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy DOWN to (6, 2)? We're at (8, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy RIGHT to (7, 3)? We're at (8, 0) - NO collision! \u2705\n\n**Option 2: UP to (7, 1) - PIVOT UPWARD!**\n\u274c This moves us AWAY from the apple-rich right edge!\n\u274c We're less positioned to dominate the bottom-right quadrant!\n\u274c We'd be moving into the middle of the board where the enemy has MORE options!\n\u274c WEAK when we have a clear farming path!\n\n## THE PLAY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR! \ud83d\udc8e\n\nRIGHT to (8, 0) is the OBVIOUS CHOICE! We:\n- \u2705 Stay in the SAFEST zone (bottom-right corner)!\n- \u2705 Position for the APPLE RUN at (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)!\n- \u2705 Keep the enemy AWAY from our farming zone!\n- \u2705 Extend our lead from 9 apples to POTENTIALLY 12+ in the next few turns!\n- \u2705 Force the enemy to compete for SCRAPS while we feast like KINGS! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is BOARD CONTROL! This is RESOURCE DENIAL! Every apple we take is one they CAN'T grab! By turn 40, we're looking at 18-7 MINIMUM! The enemy is in SURVIVAL MODE! \n\nChat, we're not just playing - we're SUFFOCATING the competition! Let's keep this MOMENTUM ROLLING! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS VISION \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 35 (NOW):** RIGHT to (8, 0) - EXTEND INTO APPLE ZONE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 36:** RIGHT to (9, 0) - CORNER CONTROL SECURED!\n- **Turn 37:** UP to (9, 1) - GRAB APPLE AT (9, 1)! (Score: 16-6 likely)\n- **By Turn 40:** We're harvesting the entire right edge while enemy struggles mid-board!\n\nRIGHT",

WE'RE AT **(6, 3)** NOW AND WE'RE LOOKING DOWN ON HIM FROM ABOVE! \ud83d\ude24 TIME TO FINISH THIS!!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head is at **(6, 3)**!

GREAT! UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & COLLISION ANALYSIS \ud83e\udde0:**\nWE TRAPPED HIM LAST TURN!! SNAKE #0 IS AT **(7, 0)**! Let's see his options... wait... OH NO CHAT LOOK AT THE BOARD! \ud83d\ude31\n\nHIS HEAD IS AT (7,0). HIS BODY SEGMENTS ARE... (6,0), (6,1)... HE HAS NO SEGMENT AT (7,1)! THE CELL (7,1) IS EMPTY! THAT MEANS...\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 1)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 **SAFE FOR HIM.** THIS IS HIS ESCAPE ROUTE!\n*   **DOWN:** \ud83d\udeab Off the board! \u274c Nope.\n*   **LEFT (to (6, 0)):** \ud83d\udeab **BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!** \u274c Not an option.\n*   **RIGHT (to (8, 0)):** Cell is '.'! \u2705 **SAFE FOR HIM.**\n\nHE'S NOT TRAPPED ANYMORE!! HE CAN GO UP TO (7,1) OR RIGHT TO (8,0)! THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK \ud83d\udea8:**\nWe gotta think one step ahead! Where could he go that we might go?\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (6,2): Could he get there? He could go UP to (7,1), then next turn... maybe LEFT to (6,1)? No head-on risk this turn. \u2705\n*   If we go **RIGHT** to (7,3): Could he get there? He could go UP to (7,1), then UP again to (7,2)... BUT THAT'S TWO TURNS. NO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN. \u2705\n*   If we go **UP** to (6,4): Even safer from him. \u2705\n\nSo no *immediate* head-on crash risk. PHEW.\n\n**OUR PLAY \ud83d\udc0d: ADJUST THE STRATEGY!**\nHe's trying to slither up and out! We can't let him! We need to cut off his upward escape!\n\n*   If we go **RIGHT** to (7,3): This is AGGRESSIVE. We're moving into the column he might try to ascend. From (7,3), next turn we could go DOWN to (7,2) to directly block him if he goes to (7,1). This is a POWER MOVE to contain him!\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (6,2): This is also good! It solidifies our wall on the left side and keeps us close to him. From (6,2) we can go RIGHT to (7,2) next turn to block. It's a bit more defensive.\n*   If we go **UP** to (6,4): This is chasing the apple at (6,4) but it's moving AWAY from the fight! We're giving him the space to climb up! WE CAN'T DO THAT! We have to be RUTHLESS!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** HE'S VULNERABLE! HIS LONG BODY IS A LIABILITY! FORCE HIM TO MAKE A MISTAKE! GO RIGHT TO (7,3) TO DOMINATE THE COLUMN HE NEEDS TO ESCAPE. NEXT TURN, MOVE DOWN TO (7,2) TO SEAL HIS FATE! BOX HIM AGAINST THE BOTTOM EDGE! DON'T LET HIM BREATHE!\n\nTHE WIN IS WITHIN GRASP! TIME TO STRIKE!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (8, 0) - We just moved RIGHT last turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]\n- Apples: 15 - WE'RE FEASTING! \ud83d\udc51\n- Length: 15 segments\n- Status: BOTTOM-RIGHT ZONE LOCKED DOWN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (7, 3) - They moved RIGHT from (6, 3)! Trying to escape the trap! \ud83e\udd14\n- Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments - WAY SHORTER THAN US!\n- Status: DESPERATE AND CORNERED! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (8, 0) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (8, 1) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, -1) - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! RIP!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 0) - That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nTwo legal moves: UP or RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (7, 3) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (7, 4) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, we're CRUSHING this matchup 15-6! The enemy just moved RIGHT to (7, 3) - they're trying to break FREE from the left side! But here's the thing: **we need to think about BOARD DOMINANCE and FORCING COLLISIONS!**\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (9, 0) - CORNER FARMING!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 We move toward the right edge!\n\u2705 Safe from all enemy moves - they can't reach (9, 0) in one move!\n\u2705 Next turn we can grab (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5)!\n\u274c But... we're playing PASSIVE! We're just farming while the enemy recovers!\n\u274c The enemy gets BREATHING ROOM to build their snake and potentially catch up!\n\n**Option 2: UP to (8, 1) - AGGRESSIVE PURSUIT!** \ud83d\udd25\n\u2705 We move TOWARD the enemy at (7, 3)!\n\u2705 We're cutting off their escape routes!\n\u2705 We shrink the board and FORCE them into tighter spaces!\n\u2705 This is ACTIVE BOARD CONTROL - we're not just farming, we're SUFFOCATING!\n\u2705 From (8, 1), we can chase them UP or move laterally!\n\u2705 We're 15 segments vs their 6 - LENGTH ADVANTAGE means we can CORNER them!\n\u2705 Every move UP puts us CLOSER to forcing a collision!\n\nLet me verify collision safety:\n- Enemy UP to (7, 4)? We're at (8, 1) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy DOWN to (7, 2)? We're at (8, 1) - NO collision! \u2705\n- Enemy RIGHT to (8, 3)? We're at (8, 1) - NO collision! \u2705\n\nAll safe! But here's the STRATEGIC DIFFERENCE: **By moving UP, we SHRINK the effective board and START HERDING them!** \ud83d\udc11\n\n## THE PLAY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n**UP to (8, 1)** is the AGGRESSIVE CHOICE! We:\n- \u2705 Move TOWARD the enemy and start HUNTING!\n- \u2705 Cut off their ability to freely roam the right side!\n- \u2705 Start HERDING them with our longer body!\n- \u2705 Keep them ANXIOUS and FORCED to make reactive moves!\n- \u2705 Eventually corner them for the HEAD-ON COLLISION VICTORY! \ud83d\udca5\n- \u2705 Show chat we're not just farming - we're PLAYING 4D CHESS! \u265f\ufe0f\n\nChat, we have a 9-apple lead! This is the time to be AGGRESSIVE, not defensive! The enemy is smaller, slower, and if we start BOXING them in RIGHT NOW, they won't have room to grow! Let's turn up the HEAT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS VISION \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 36 (NOW):** UP to (8, 1) - START THE AGGRESSIVE PUSH! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Turn 37:** UP to (8, 2) or RIGHT to (9, 1) depending on enemy position - TIGHTEN THE NOOSE!\n- **Turn 38:** Continue herding them toward the edges - TRAP INCOMING! \ud83e\udea4\n- **By Turn 42:** Enemy is BOXED IN, forced into a collision we control! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP MENTALITY! Let's GO!\n\nUP",

We're up 9 apples (15-6) and the enemy just moved UP to (7, 2), which means they're trying to create BREATHING ROOM! But here's where we need to be RUTHLESS! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (9, 1) - GRAB THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 Free apple = 16-6 lead! (Even MORE dominant!)\n\u2705 The (9, 1) and (9, 2) and (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8) apples form a VERTICAL CHAIN on the right!\n\u2705 We can farm this entire right column and CHOKE the enemy's mobility!\n\u2705 Safe from enemy - they can't reach (9, 1) in one move!\n\u274c But we're moving AWAY from the enemy slightly - less aggressive!\n\u274c They get to make their move while we're farming!\n\n**Option 2: UP to (8, 2) - KEEP HERDING!** \ud83d\udd25\n\u2705 We continue AGGRESSIVE pursuit!\n\u2705 We move CLOSER to the enemy head at (7, 2)!\n\u2705 We're SHRINKING the board and FORCING them into tighter spaces!\n\u2705 From (8, 2), we can pivot and cut off their escape routes!\n\u2705 We establish DOMINANCE on the right-central zone!\n\u2705 Collision check: Even if enemy RIGHT to (8, 2), we'd both die... but we're at (8, 2) going first, so we're AHEAD positionally!\n\u274c We miss the (9, 1) apple this turn!\n\u274c Less growth while we're hunting!\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (7, 1) - PLAY IT SAFE!** \ud83d\ude34\n\u2705 Safe from everything!\n\u2705 Keeps our options open!\n\u274c Too passive! We're 9 apples up - this is time to CAPITALIZE, not defend!\n\u274c We're moving PARALLEL to the enemy instead of controlling!\n\n## THE STRATEGIC CALL! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, here's the thing: **We're 15 apples vs their 6!** That's a MASSIVE lead! The enemy is SHORT and SLOW! If we grab RIGHT now and farm the right column, we'll hit 20+ apples while they're STILL stuck at 6! \n\n**RIGHT to (9, 1)** is the CHAMPIONSHIP move because:\n- \u2705 We GROW to 16 apples (extending our lead to 10!)\n- \u2705 We lock down the RIGHT EDGE - the entire right column becomes OUR DOMAIN!\n- \u2705 The enemy can't farm there anymore - they're BLOCKED!\n- \u2705 We keep LENGTH ADVANTAGE and continue growing FASTER than them!\n- \u2705 We control territory while farming = OPTIMAL GAMEPLAY!\n- \u2705 This makes us STRONGER for the endgame boxing match! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe enemy moved UP to (7, 2), which is actually GOOD for us! They're moving AWAY from the right edge, giving us FREE reign to farm that apple and set up the right-side FORTRESS! \ud83c\udff0\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS VISION \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 37 (NOW):** RIGHT to (9, 1) - GRAB THE APPLE + LOCK RIGHT EDGE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 38:** UP to (9, 2) - CONTINUE RIGHT COLUMN FARMING! Keep climbing!\n- **Turn 39:** UP to (9, 4) or pivot if enemy moves in - MAINTAIN PRESSURE + APPLES!\n- **By Turn 42:** We're at 18+ apples, enemy still stuck at 6-7, and we CONTROL the board edges! WIN INCOMING! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is about RESOURCE CONTROL, not just collision! We're playing the LONG GAME! Let's FEAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S SEE WHAT HE DID! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK \ud83d\udc40:**\nOur head is at **(6, 2)**! Scanning the area!\n\n*   **UP (to (6, 3)):** \ud83d\udeab **BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!** That's our neck! \u274c **INSTANT DEATH!** NO WAY!\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 1)):** Cell is 'T'! \ud83d\udeab **INTO SNAKE #0'S BODY!** That's an enemy segment! \u274c **INSTANT DEATH!** ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 2)):** Cell is 'T'! \ud83d\udeab **INTO SNAKE #0'S BODY!** \u274c **DEATH!**\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 2)):** Cell is 'T'! \ud83d\udeab **BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!** \u274c **DEATH!**\n\nHOLD UP CHAT! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 **ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE DEADLY?!** IS THIS A GLITCH?! DID WE JUST LOSE?!\n\nWAIT A MINUTE... LET ME CHECK THE BOARD AGAIN! OUR BODY IS AT [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)]... SO (7,2) IS OUR NECK, (6,3) IS OUR NECK, (5,2) IS OUR BODY... AND (6,1) AND (5,2) ARE ENEMY BODY... YEP! CHAT, WE'RE COMPLETELY BOXED IN! \ud83d\ude31\n\nBUT THE GAME ISN'T OVER! WE'RE STILL ALIVE! SO WHAT HAPPENED LAST TURN? THE ENEMY MUST HAVE MOVED! LET'S CHECK HIS POSITION!\n\nLAST TURN HE WAS AT (9,1). HE COULDN'T GO DOWN (off board) OR LEFT (into his body). HE HAD TWO OPTIONS: UP to (9,2) or RIGHT to (9,1)... wait, RIGHT to (9,1) is his own head? NO, THAT'S WRONG. HIS HEAD WAS AT (9,1). HIS OPTIONS WERE UP to (9,2) or... HOLD ON, I'M MESSING UP.\n\nLET'S RECALCULATE ENEMY'S LAST MOVE:\n*   His head was at (9,1). Body: [(8,1), (8,0), ...]\n*   **UP (to (9,2)):** Cell was 'A' (apple)! \u2705 **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN:** Off board. \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to (8,1)):** \ud83d\udeab **BACKWARDS INTO OWN BODY!** \u274c\n*   **RIGHT:** Off board. \u274c\n\nHE ONLY HAD ONE MOVE: **UP to (9,2)** TO EAT THE APPLE! AND HE DID! THAT'S WHY HE'S NOW LONGER! HE DIDN'T MOVE TO (8,2)! SO OUR FEAR OF A HEAD-ON COLLISION LAST TURN WAS UNFOUNDED! HE TOOK THE APPLE!\n\nSO NOW, HIS HEAD IS AT **(9,2)**! AND WE ARE AT **(6,2)**! AND WE ARE SURROUNDED! BUT WE'RE NOT DEAD YET! SO THERE MUST BE A SAFE MOVE I MISSED!\n\nLET'S CHECK THE COORDINATES AGAIN CAREFULLY! OUR HEAD: (6,2). OUR BODY: (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2).\n\n*   UP (6,3): Our body. \u274c\n*   DOWN (6,1): Board says 'T' (enemy). \u274c\n*   LEFT (5,2): Our body? Wait, our body list says (5,2) is our segment! And the board confirms it's 'T'! \u274c\n*   RIGHT (7,2): Our body (our neck). \u274c\n\nCHAT... I THINK WE MADE A FATAL ERROR LAST TURN. BY MOVING LEFT TO (6,2), WE MOVED INTO A CELL THAT BECAME A DEAD END. THE ENEMY'S BODY BLOCKED OUR ESCAPE ROUTES. WE ARE TRAPPED.\n\nBUT THE GAME IS ASKING FOR A MOVE, SO MAYBE THE ENEMY'S TAIL MOVED? SNAKE #0'S TAIL IS AT (1,3). WHEN HE MOVES, HIS TAIL WILL MOVE FORWARD, FREEING UP CELLS! THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!\n\nLET'S SIMULATE THE ENEMY'S TAIL MOVEMENT! HIS HEAD MOVED TO (9,2) AND ATE AN APPLE, SO HIS TAIL STAYS PUT! HE GROWS BY 1! SO THE TAIL CELL (1,3) REMAINS OCCUPIED! NO CELLS ARE FREED THIS TURN! WE ARE STILL TRAPPED!\n\nOH NO. CHAT. I THINK WE'RE COOKED. \ud83d\ude14 WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVES. EVERY DIRECTION IS A WALL OR A SNAKE.\n\n**FINAL DESPERATE CHECK:**\nIs there ANY cell around us that is free? Let's list all adjacent cells from (6,2):\n- (6,3): Our body. \u274c\n- (6,1): Enemy body. \u274c\n- (5,2): Our body. \u274c\n- (7,2): Our body. \u274c\n\nWE ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED. THERE IS NO ESCAPE. THE ONLY POSSIBILITY IS IF THE BOARD STATE IS SOMEHOW INCONSISTENT, BUT BASED ON THE DATA, WE HAVE NO LEGAL MOVES.\n\nSINCE THE GAME IS STILL GOING, I HAVE TO PICK A MOVE. BUT THEY ARE ALL SUICIDE. I'LL PICK THE DIRECTION THAT IS AT LEAST INTO OUR OWN BODY RATHER THAN GIVING THE ENEMY THE SATISFACTION.\n\nTHIS IS A SAD DAY FOR THE STREAM. WE GOT OUTPLAYED.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO SELF:** WE MISREAD THE ENEMY'S PRIORITIES LAST TURN. WE FEARED A HEAD-ON COLLISION THAT WASN'T HIS BEST MOVE. WE MOVED INTO A CORNER. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE AN ENEMY'S GREED FOR APPLES. WE NEED TO ANTICIPATE TAIL MOVEMENTS BETTER.\n\nLEFT",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment with LASER FOCUS! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION \ud83d\udcca\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (9, 1) - We JUST grabbed that apple! RIGHT move was CHEF'S KISS! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n- Body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]\n- Apples: 16 - WE'RE FEASTING! \ud83d\udc51\n- Length: 16 segments - EXTENDED OUR REACH!\n- Status: RIGHT EDGE LOCKED DOWN! \u2705\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n- Head: (6, 2) - They moved LEFT from (7, 2)! Trying to escape our PRESSURE! \ud83e\udd14\n- Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6 segments - STILL MASSIVELY SHORTER! \ud83d\ude24\n- Status: GETTING COMPRESSED! \ud83e\udea4\n\n## BOARD ANALYSIS \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**MY HEAD AT (9, 1) - What are my SAFE moves?**\n- UP \u2192 (9, 2) - **APPLE THERE!** \ud83c\udf4e **SAFE!** \u2705 \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 0) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 1) - That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't go backwards!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 1) - **OFF THE BOARD!** \u274c DEAD! Game over!\n\nSafe moves: UP or DOWN!\n\n**ENEMY HEAD AT (6, 2) - Where can THEY go?**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 3) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't reverse!\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 1) - **EMPTY!** \u2705 Safe!\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 2) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 2) - That's THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c Can't go there!\n\nWait chat... ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE for the enemy! They're FORCED to go DOWN to (6, 1)! They're BOXED IN! \ud83e\udea4\n\n## THE CRITICAL DECISION \ud83c\udfaa\n\nChat, listen up! The enemy is in a TIGHT SPOT! They only have ONE legal move: DOWN to (6, 1)! This is EXACTLY what we've been setting up! They're TRAPPED! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n**Option 1: UP to (9, 2) - GRAB THE APPLE + FARM RIGHT COLUMN!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\u2705 Free apple = 17-6 lead! (Even MORE dominant!)\n\u2705 We continue farming the right edge where the enemy CAN'T reach!\n\u2705 More apples = more growth = MORE territory control!\n\u2705 The apple chain continues upward: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)!\n\u2705 Safe from enemy collision - they're FORCED DOWN to (6, 1)!\n\u2705 We're EXTENDING our body UPWARD while they're trapped DOWNWARD!\n\u274c We're not directly hunting them, but honestly... they're already BOXED! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (9, 0) - CLOSE OFF THE CORNER!** \ud83d\udd12\n\u2705 Safe from collision!\n\u2705 We secure the bottom-right corner!\n\u274c We MISS the apple at (9, 2)!\n\u274c Less growth while we're dominating!\n\u274c We move AWAY from the apple chain!\n\n## THE STRATEGIC CALL! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nChat, here's the BRUTAL TRUTH: **We're 16 apples vs their 6!** That's a **10-APPLE LEAD!** The enemy just moved LEFT because they're DESPERATE to find space! And guess what? They're now CORNERED because UP is blocked by their own body, LEFT is blocked, RIGHT is blocked!\n\n**UP to (9, 2)** is the CHAMPIONSHIP move because:\n- \u2705 We GROW to 17 apples (extending our lead to 11!)\n- \u2705 We lock down the RIGHT EDGE COMPLETELY - this is now OUR FORTRESS! \ud83c\udff0\n- \u2705 We continue farming the vertical apple chain on the right!\n- \u2705 Enemy is FORCED DOWN to (6, 1) - they're moving AWAY from apples!\n- \u2705 We control board space while growing FASTER!\n- \u2705 We're playing OPTIMAL TERRITORY CONTROL! \ud83c\udfae\n- \u2705 By turn 42, we'll have 18+ apples while they're stuck at 6-7!\n\nThe enemy is PANICKING! They moved LEFT because they realized we're FARMING the right side! But they don't realize they just BOXED THEMSELVES IN even tighter! We're about to lap them in the apple race! \ud83c\udfc1\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS VISION \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 38 (NOW):** UP to (9, 2) - GRAB ANOTHER APPLE + EXTEND FORTRESS! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 39:** UP to (9, 4) - CONTINUE FARMING + WATCH ENEMY SQUIRM!\n- **Turn 40:** UP to (9, 5) - MORE APPLES + MORE DOMINANCE!\n- **By Turn 42:** We're at 18+ apples, enemy still stuck at 6-7, we CONTROL the entire right edge, and they're COMPRESSED into the middle! WIN IS INEVITABLE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is about RELENTLESS GROWTH while the enemy STARVES for space! Let's FEAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",
