Now, considering next move options:\n  \n**Possible moves:**\n- UP: Moving from (4, 5) to (4, 6).  \n  *Pros:* Moves upward away from the snake's current position.  \n  *Cons:* Currently, (4, 6) is empty, but the apple at (6, 9) is far, and the apple at (4, 4) is below. Moving UP doesn't bring us closer to any apple.\n  \n- DOWN: Moving to (4, 4):  \n  *Pros:* Approaches the apple at (4, 4), which is directly below; the game logic suggests this is a good immediate goal.  \n  *Cons:* Potential risk if a snake plans to cut that path, but it seems safe given the current state and no snake occupying (4, 4).\n  \n- LEFT: Moving from (4,5) to (3,5):  \n  *Pros:* No apparent immediate risk.  \n  *Cons:* Doesn't help reach any apple directly and might take us away from the target apple at (4, 4).\n  \n- RIGHT: Moving to (5, 5):  \n  *Pros:* Slightly toward the apple at (6, 9), but it\u2019s a long-term goal.  \n  *Cons:* Moving away from the immediate apple at (4,4), and the move was previously decided as the last move, but now, since we're considering the next move, it might not be optimal if we're targeting the apple directly below.\n\nGiven the goal to quickly reach the apple at (4,4), the most straightforward and safe move is DOWN to (4,4).\n\n**Next move:** DOWN",
