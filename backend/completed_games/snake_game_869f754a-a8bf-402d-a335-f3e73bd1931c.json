Moving UP would immediately eat it, growing the snake and increasing my apples count from 6 to 7.\n- Moving UP keeps escape options open and doesn\u2019t collide with any enemy snake\u2019s current position. The enemy head is at (7,1); in this turn they can\u2019t reach (5,3) in one move, so there\u2019s no head-on risk this turn.\n- If I instead move DOWN to (5,1) or RIGHT to (6,2), I wouldn\u2019t gain an apple this turn and could reduce future flexibility or approach to other apples.\n\nPlan:\n- Short-term: eat the apple at (5,3) by moving UP this turn, growing the snake and boosting my apples to 7.\n- Medium-term: after the growth, head towards other high-value apples (e.g., (4,6) or (5,9)) while avoiding the enemy\u2019s body and potential traps.
