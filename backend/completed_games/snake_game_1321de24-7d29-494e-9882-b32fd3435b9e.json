Moving RIGHT again would move us to (9,0), where there's an apple.\n- Moving onto (9,0) is safe because:\n  - It's within bounds (x=9, y=0).\n  - There are no other snakes or obstacles in that position.\n  - Our snake's body is only at (8,0), so no risk of self-collision.\n- The apple at (9,0) is directly ahead, and since we haven't yet eaten it, moving RIGHT will allow us to grow and increase our points.\n- After moving onto the apple, our new head position will be (9,0).\n\nPotential concerns:\n- The wall at x=9: moving into (9,0) is exactly on the edge but within the boundary, so it's safe.\n- The enemy snake at (2,6): far away from our current path; no immediate threat.\n- No obstacles ahead that would cause collision.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT to reach and eat the apple at (9,0). This move maximizes our current growth potential without risking collision.\n\nNext, I will choose: RIGHT.",

I'll need to keep moving up to reach it, so I should continue to increase my y coordinate. However, I also need to be more mindful of my x movement to avoid running into the wall. I am currently moving right to increase my x coordinate.\n\nHmm... I think I need to balance my x and y movement to reach the apple while avoiding the wall. I'll need to keep moving right to get closer to the apple, but I also need to be careful not to go too far.\n\nOkay, let's review the options... apple is at x=7, so I'll aim for there. Enemy snakes are not in the way, and I don't see any other obstacles... still on track, and I get to keep moving up as well... \n\nMy goal is still to reach the (7, 7) apple, but I need to make sure to balance my x and y movement. I can continue moving right and up, trying to close the distance to the apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP.",
