Our rival is way down at $(1, 1)$. We are up north, chilling in the apple orchard! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**The immediate goal?** Apple acquisition and positioning! We are much closer to a cluster of apples up here than our rival is down there. We need to capitalize on this geographical advantage! Look, we have apples at $(2, 7)$, $(3, 7)$, $(5, 7)$, $(7, 8)$, and even a cheeky one at $(7, 1)$ a bit further away.\n\n**Let's analyze the move possibilities (Turn 0):**\n\nOur head is at $(1, 7)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 8)):** Safe! Keeps us high up. There's an apple close by at $(2, 7)$, but moving up is heading away from it slightly. Still, it's a very open part of the board.\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 6)):** Safe! This moves us closer to the central action and is on a direct path to the apple at $(2, 7)$ if we choose to go right next turn. This seems solid.\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 7)):** Safe! Edge of the board, but safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 7)):** **HOLY MOLY, CHAT!** This is an immediate apple! $(2, 7)$ is an apple location! If we move RIGHT, we secure the first piece of content! Can Snake #1 reach $(2, 7)$? Snake #1 is at $(1, 1)$. Moving right to $(2, 7)$ is an *instant* score. This is a no-brainer, right?\n\n**Enemy Analysis (Snake #1 at (1, 1)):**\n\nSnake #1 can move to $(0, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, or $(1, 2)$. None of these moves interfere with us at $(2, 7)$. We are clear to eat!\n\n**The Plan:** We go RIGHT, snag that apple at $(2, 7)$, and immediately gain the length advantage. This forces our opponent to react to us! We are starting the domination early!\n\n**Long Term Strategy Note:**\nGrab the surrounding northern apples $((3, 7), (5, 7))$ immediately to build length. Use the length advantage to establish control over the center-left columns (0-5) and box Snake 1 in towards the bottom right if they linger down there. Priority is growth and safe expansion.\n\nGotta make that $1,000 IQ$ move! We're taking the apple! \ud83c\udf4e EZ CLAP!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! What a first move! We snagged the apple at $(2, 7)$, gaining the early lead! $1-0$ in apples, and we have the crucial length advantage! We are now 2 segments long: Head at $(2, 7)$, Tail at $(1, 7)$. Our rival, Snake #1, is still down at $(2, 1)$ with no body. EZ content!\n\n**Curent State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **Our Head:** $(2, 7)$\n*   **Our Body (Tail):** $(1, 7)$\n*   **Next Apples:** $(3, 7)$, $(5, 7)$, $(7, 8)$, and the closest cluster is right along $y=7$.\n*   **Rival Head (Snake #1):** $(2, 1)$\n\nOur immediate goal is to press the advantage, link up another apple, and keep Snake #1 bottled up down south. We want to own the top half of the board!\n\n**Elimination Phase (Protecting the Bag \ud83e\udd11):**\n\nOur head is at $(2, 7)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 8)):** Safe! Moves us towards the edge, away from the next immediate apple $(3, 7)$, but keeps us on the high ground.\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 6)):** **HOLY MOLY, CHAT!** Is $(2, 6)$ an apple? Yes! The map says 'A' at $(2, 6)$! Another immediate score! Is it safe?\n    *   It's safe from us (our tail is at $(1, 7)$).\n    *   Can Snake #1 reach $(2, 6)$? Snake #1 is at $(2, 1)$. Minimum 5 moves diagonally, or 6 moves straight up. No collision danger.\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 7)):** **DANGER!** This is where our tail currently is, which is where our *new* body segment is settling. We can't move into our own body! Even though the physical body segment *moves* with us, we cannot move into the cell that the body segment occupies *before* the move. Wait... the segment at $(1, 7)$ will vacate, but moving directly backwards is instant death. Can we move into $(1, 7)$? Since we just ate, the segment at $(1, 7)$ **will remain** there while the rest of the body shifts, *if* we didn't grow. But since we *did* grow, the $(1, 7)$ segment becomes part of our body. Moving LEFT to $(1, 7)$ is moving directly backwards toward our body. This is a fatal move if the body segment moves to $(1, 7)$. **Crucially:** the rules state \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" $(1, 7)$ is the previous head position, now the first body segment. Moving back here is DEATH! **ELIMINATED!** (Never move from $(x, y)$ to the coordinate occupied by the body segment behind it).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 7)):** **ANOTHER APPLE!** $(3, 7)$ is also an apple! This is a jackpot! Is it safe?\n    *   No self-collision.\n    *   No wall collision.\n    *   No threat from Snake #1.\n\n**Strategy Assessment: RIGHT vs. DOWN**\n\nBoth RIGHT (to $(3, 7)$) and DOWN (to $(2, 6)$) are immediate apples (CONTENT!). Which one sets us up better?\n\n*   **If RIGHT (to (3, 7)):** We gain another apple and move $1$ unit to the right. The next apple candidates are $(5, 7)$, $(7, 8)$, and $(8, 7)$. This keeps us along the $y=7$ highway, which is stacked with resources! We are building a long horizontal barrier.\n*   **If DOWN (to (2, 6)):** We gain an apple and move $1$ unit down. This drops us next to another apple at $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 1)$, but pulling down moves us into the central board, which Snake #1 might eventually contest. However, it also opens up the path to apple $(2, 3)$.\n\n**The Box-In Strategy:**\nOur long-term goal is to box Snake #1. Snake #1 is currently at $(2, 1)$. We are at $(2, 7)$ and have length 2. If we continue RIGHT, we build a long snake across $y=7$. If Snake #1 moves up (e.g., to $(2, 2)$), our growing horizontal snake creates a massive north wall. This is exactly what we want!\n\nMoving RIGHT to $(3, 7)$ is superior because:\n1.  **Keeps the high ground:** We maintain dominance over the juicy high-coordinate apples.\n2.  **Sets up the wall:** Continuing horizontally builds a barrier $y=7$ and prepares us for the $(5, 7)$ apple, extending our reach.\n3.  **Maximum Growth:** We prioritize maximum, safe growth to establish dominance.\n\nWe take the high road, literally! Let's get that $(3, 7)$ apple! CHAT, this is a smooth, $2000 IQ$ back-to-back grab! We are going for the sweep!\n\n**Next Turn Plan (Turn 2):** After eating at $(3, 7)$, our head will be at $(3, 7)$, body at $(2, 7)$, $(1, 7)$. We should probably continue RIGHT to $(4, 7)$ (empty space) or $(5, 7)$ (apple), depending on what the rival does. Right now, maximizing length is key.\n\nRIGHT",

LFG!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: The Wall Builder\n\n**Current State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(3, 7)$\n*   Body: $[(2, 7), (1, 7)]$ (Length 3!)\n*   Apples Collected: 2\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(3, 1)$\n*   Body: none (Length 1)\n*   Apples Collected: 0\n\n**Board Observation:**\nThe board is still rich in the top half!\n*   Nearest apples: $(5, 7)$ (A), $(7, 8)$ (A), $(2, 6)$ (A), $(5, 9)$ (A).\n*   Snake #1 is down at $(3, 1)$ and has 4 options: UP to $(3, 2)$ (empty), DOWN to $(3, 0)$ (empty), LEFT to $(2, 1)$ (empty), or RIGHT to $(4, 1)$ (APPLE!).\n\nOur immediate goal is to continue growing this wall at $y=7$ and keep Snake #1 bottled up. We need to snag $(5, 7)$ before we consider dropping down or pushing up.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (Don't Get LUL'd)\n\nOur head is at $(3, 7)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 8)):** Safe! Moves towards the center top, but away from the immediate $(5, 7)$ apple. An option, but not the best.\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 6)):** $(3, 6)$ is an APPLE! Immediate score! Is it safe?\n    *   No self-collision (body is at $(2, 7)$, $(1, 7)$).\n    *   No wall collision.\n    *   Rival is at $(3, 1)$. Could the rival move to $(3, 6)$? No way, that's 5 moves straight up. Safe from rival collision.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 7)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Moving backwards is instant death. **ELIMINATED!** (No throws, Chat!)\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 7)):** Empty space. Safe! This moves us closer to the $(5, 7)$ apple and extends the horizontal wall.\n\nWait, I missed an apple! The nearest apple is $(3, 6)$! And $(5, 7)$!\n\n#### 2. Decision: Maximize $y=7$ Wall or Drop for $(3, 6)$?\n\nWe have two strong options:\n*   **A) Go DOWN to $(3, 6)$ (Apple):** Instant growth, potentially sets us up for the apple at $(2, 6)$ next turn, but it breaks our horizontal line and moves us slightly closer (vertically) to the rival's path if they decide to rush straight up.\n*   **B) Go RIGHT to $(4, 7)$ (Empty):** Sets us up perfectly for the $(5, 7)$ apple next turn. This continues the dominant horizontal wall, making the top half of the board clearly \"ours.\" It also leaves us flexibility to then go UP or continue to $(5, 7)$.\n\n**Rival Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at $(3, 1)$. The apple at $(4, 1)$ is a massive lure.\n*   **Most Likely Rival Move:** RIGHT to $(4, 1)$ (Apple). Snake #1 needs length desperately. (If \\#1 eats, their head is at $(4, 1)$, body at $(3, 1)$.)\n*   If \\#1 goes UP, they move to $(3, 2)$.\n\nIf we prioritize building the wall (Option B, RIGHT), we immediately claim territory and set up a guaranteed 3rd apple next turn at $(5, 7)$.\n\nIf we go DOWN to $(3, 6)$, we get the apple now, but it's an awkward position. We'd have to decide between RIGHT (moving away from an apple) or LEFT/DOWN (getting congested near $(2, 6)$ and $(2, 3)$).\n\n**The Box-In Strategy Update:** We want to create a north-south divide. The long snake along $y=7$ is the PERFECT high wall. We maintain pressure and set up Snake #1 for a late-game crash. Taking $(3, 6)$ now gets us the point, but taking $(5, 7)$ next turn via $(4, 7)$ solidifies our territorial control and forces Snake #1 to stay low.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and move RIGHT, guaranteeing the $(5, 7)$ apple and extending our barrier. This is the $2000 IQ$ macro play, Chat! We're planning two steps ahead!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 3):**\nMove $\\rightarrow$ RIGHT to $(4, 7)$. This sets up the $(5, 7)$ apple for Turn 3. After eating at $(5, 7)$, we will have length 5! We should then consider how to approach $(7, 8)$ while simultaneously looking for opportunities to drop a segment down to block Snake \\#1's vertical path if they reach $y=3$ or $y=4$.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the board and see what our rival did. Did he take the bait?\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: Securing the West Wall\n\n**Current State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(4, 7)$\n*   Body: $[(3, 7), (2, 7)]$ (Length 3)\n*   Apples Collected: 2\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(4, 1)$\n*   Body: $[(3, 1)]$ (Length 2)\n*   Apples Collected: 1 (He took the bait! LFG!)\n\n**Board Observation:**\nWe are sitting perfectly at $(4, 7)$, right next to our target apple at $(5, 7)$. Snake #1 is now at $(4, 1)$, a bit longer, but still far down! He's trapped in the low $y$ region, exactly as planned!\n\n**Current Map Focus:**\nWe need to lock down the apple at $(5, 7)$ and continue building our dividing wall.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (No Throws!)\n\nOur head is at $(4, 7)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (4, 8)):** Safe! Excellent position, moves us towards the center and $(5, 9)$ and $(7, 8)$ apples.\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 6)):** Safe! Moves us towards the apples at $(3, 6)$ and $(2, 6)$.\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 7)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 7)):** **APPLE!** Instant score! Is it safe?\n    *   No self-collision.\n    *   No wall collision.\n    *   Rival is at $(4, 1)$. Could the rival possibly reach $(5, 7)$? Absolutely not. Safe from rival collision.\n\n#### 2. Decision: Go for the Core Objective!\n\nOur entire plan hinged on moving RIGHT to $(4, 7)$ last turn, specifically to set up the hit on $(5, 7)$ this turn! This is a no-brainer. We secure the apple, grow to length 4, and continue to dominate the top half of the board.\n\n**Rival Prediction (What is Snake #1 doing now?):**\nSnake #1 is at $(4, 1)$. They can go:\n*   UP (4, 2): Empty, moves towards center.\n*   DOWN (4, 0): Empty, might set up for $(6, 0)$ apple later.\n*   LEFT (3, 1): Backwards into their own body segment at $(3, 1)$? No, Snake #1's body is at $(3, 1)$ but they moved **from** $(3, 1)$ to $(4, 1)$. So $(3, 1)$ is now empty. LEFT to $(3, 1)$ is safe. This keeps them near the center $x$ line.\n*   RIGHT (5, 1): Empty, moves them east.\n\nSnake #1 probably wants to move up and challenge our turf, or grab the nearby $(7, 1)$ apple. If they try to move up, UP to $(4, 2)$ is the most likely path to break out.\n\n**Our Choice: RIGHT to (5, 7) (APPLE!)**\nThis move is high-value, safe, and part of the long-term territorial control plan. We hit the apple, and our new body is at $(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)$. Our wall is now extended to $x=5$ at $y=7$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Turns):**\nAfter eating at $(5, 7)$, we will have established a strong base. The next targets are $(7, 8)$ and $(5, 9)$.\n1.  **Turn 4:** Move UP to $(5, 8)$ or UP to $(6, 7)$ and then up. Moving UP to (5, 8) sets us up for $(5, 9)$ and keeps us high.\n2.  We must keep watching Snake #1. If they try to move aggressively up the center, we need to be prepared to drop a tail segment or position defensively to cut them off around $y=4$ or $y=5$.\n\nLet's get this apple! **RIGHT!**\n\nRIGHT",

LFG!\n\nLast turn was executed perfectly. The wall at $y=7$ is looking SOLID. Now we have a long snake (length 4) and total board control in the high-y area. Time to press the advantage and look for that box-in play!\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: Boxing Out Strategy\n\n**Current State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(5, 7)$ (Just ate!)\n*   Body: $[(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)]$ (Length 4)\n*   Apples Collected: 3\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(5, 1)$ (He moved RIGHT from $(4, 1)$!)\n*   Body: $[(4, 1)]$ (Length 2)\n*   Apples Collected: 1\n\n**Board Observation:**\nSnake #1 is now at $(5, 1)$, confirming he is trying to move along the bottom edge, probably targeting the $(7, 1)$ or $(6, 0)$ apples. This is ideal! He's trapped himself low. Our wall at $y=7$ is firmly in place.\n\nWe are at $(5, 7)$. We have two juicy apples directly above us: $(5, 9)$ and $(7, 8)$.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (No Throws!)\n\nOur head is at $(5, 7)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 8)):** Safe! Moves us toward the $(5, 9)$ apple. This is high-priority content!\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 6)):** Safe! Moves us towards the opponent's territory, which might be useful for cutting him off, but it moves us away from high-value apples.\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 7)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 7)):** Safe! Moves us towards the $(7, 8)$ apple and allows us to solidify the wall further east.\n\n#### 2. Decision: Prioritizing Apples and Positioning\n\nWe have two great moves: UP to $(5, 8)$ and RIGHT to $(6, 7)$.\n\n*   If we move **UP to (5, 8)**, we are one move away from the $(5, 9)$ apple. This keeps us centered on $x=5$ and prepares us for moving right later towards $x=7, 8, 9$.\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (6, 7)**, we are setting up for a potential RIGHT to $(7, 7)$, then UP to $(7, 8)$ (apple). This move extends our wall and puts pressure on the middle of the board while keeping our previous path $x=5$ open for a loop-back.\n\nLet's look at Snake #1's options from $(5, 1)$:\n\n*   **UP (5, 2) (APPLE):** High likelihood! This is an immediate score, moves him up slightly, and maintains the threat of him trying to bust into the center.\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):** Safe, but less immediate value than UP (5, 2).\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Safe, moves him toward the $(7, 1)$ apple.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to $(5, 2)$, he grows to length 3, and his head is getting dangerously close to the center line. We need to maintain our dominance.\n\n**The Power Move: UP to (5, 8)**\n1.  **Safety:** It's completely safe; the opponent is 6 squares away.\n2.  **Value:** It puts us one move away from the $(5, 9)$ apple. The next turn, we can immediately go UP and score 4 points!\n3.  **Contingency:** From $(5, 8)$, we have options to move LEFT (towards the center wall) or RIGHT (towards $(7, 8)$). This keeps our options wide open.\n\nThis is the fastest path to the next apple and maintains our vertical control. We keep pressing them down! We are creating a huge advantage in length and territory. We secure $(5, 9)$, then potentially loop back down the $x=9$ wall or cut across to $(7, 8)$.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The High-Ground Squeeze\n\nWe go UP to $(5, 8)$. Next turn, we hit the $(5, 9)$ apple. After that, we are at $(5, 9)$. We then move towards $(7, 8)$ to clean up the center-right high-ground. Meanwhile, Snake #1 will be scavenging in the $y \\le 2$ zone. We need to be ready to drop a vertical cut-off line around $x=7$ or $x=8$ once we have enough length.\n\nPlan:\nTurn 5: UP to $(5, 9)$ (APPLE!)\nTurn 6: RIGHT to $(6, 9)$ or RIGHT to $(6, 8)$ (depending on board state).\nGoal: Isolate Snake #1 in the $y \\le 5$ region.\n\nLet's secure this next apple, CHAT! **UP!**\n\nUP",

We secured the $(5, 8)$ position, and we are staring down the barrel of an easy 4th apple at $(5, 9)$! Snake #1 is still floundering down low, completely boxed out of the high-value territory. LFG!\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: The Easy Money Play\n\n**Our State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(5, 8)$\n*   Body: $[(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]$ (Length 4)\n*   Apples Collected: 3\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(5, 2)$\n*   Body: $[(5, 1), (4, 1)]$ (Length 3)\n*   Apples Collected: 2 (He ate the $(5, 2)$ apple, as predicted! Good read, chat!)\n\n**Board Observation:**\nSnake #1 is now at $(5, 2)$. He grew to length 3. His next likely targets are $(7, 1)$, $(6, 0)$, or perhaps $(2, 3)$. He's positioned centrally, but locked in the lower half of the board.\n\nWe are at $(5, 8)$. We have a MEGA apple directly above us: $(5, 9)$! This move is too good to pass up.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (Don't Throw!)\n\nOur head is at $(5, 8)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 9)):** Apple! Instant score, growth, and excellent high-ground position. Safe! This is the play!\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 7)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 8)):** Safe! Moves us towards the center and the $(2, 6)$ apple, but away from the immediate score.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 8)):** Safe! Moves us towards the $(7, 8)$ apple, but away from the immediate score.\n\nOnly one move gets us an apple *this turn*, and it's completely safe. The math is easy, chat!\n\n#### 2. Opponent Movement Prediction for Safety Check\n\nSnake #1 is at $(5, 2)$.\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Safe. Moves him slightly higher.\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** Safe. Moves him back onto his tail (which disappears).\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):** Safe. Moves him toward the $(2, 3)$ and $(4, 2)$ apples.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safe. Moves him toward the $(7, 1)$ apple.\n\nNo matter where he moves, he is minimum 5 squares ( Manhattan distance) away from us. There is zero risk of collision.\n\n### The Decision: UP for the Score!\n\nWe take the immediate apple at $(5, 9)$. This increases our length to 5 and our score to 4! The advantage becomes massive.\n\n**Future Plan (The Box-In Strategy):**\nAfter reaching $(5, 9)$:\n*   We'll be at $(5, 9)$.\n*   Next turn (Turn 6), we should move RIGHT to $(6, 9)$ or $(6, 8)$. Our primary goal is the $(7, 8)$ apple. By moving RIGHT, we solidify our control over the top boundary (the $y=9$ wall) and then drop down to clean up the center-right.\n*   We will use our length to establish a vertical wall at $x=7$ or $x=8$ to cut off all access to the right side of the board for Snake #1. We're creating a prison, chat!\n\nLet's secure this bag! UP is the only move we need!\n\nUP",

We just snagged the $(5, 9)$ apple, and now we are a massive snake looking for our next meal and, more importantly, a way to absolutely TERRORIZE Snake #1!\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: Securing the Perimeter\n\n**Our State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(5, 9)$\n*   Body: $[(5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]$ (Length 5)\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n*   Tail is at $(3, 7)$, which means $(3, 7)$ will be open next turn if we don't eat.\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(6, 2)$\n*   Body: $[(5, 2), (5, 1)]$ (Length 3)\n*   Apples Collected: 2\n*   Tail is at $(5, 1)$.\n\n**Board Observation:**\nWe are high and central. Our next immediate targets are $(7, 8)$ and $(8, 9)$. Snake #1 is low and heading right, likely trying for the $(7, 1)$ apple or possibly the $(6, 0)$ apple.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (Don't Get Cocky!)\n\nOur head is at $(5, 9)$.\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board (y=10). **ELIMINATED!** We are at the wall!\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 8)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 9)):** Safe! Moves us along the top wall. Good option.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 9)):** Safe! Moves us towards the $(7, 8)$ and $(8, 9)$ apples. Excellent position for control. This is the dominant move.\n\nWe have a choice between LEFT and RIGHT. Both are safe, but RIGHT is strategically superior. Why?\n\nIf we go RIGHT, we continue our path toward the high-value cluster of apples on the right side of the board ($(7, 8)$, $(8, 9)$, $(8, 7)$). More importantly, we start building our crushing wall.\n\n#### 2. Opponent Movement Prediction for Collision/Strategy Check\n\nSnake #1 is at $(6, 2)$. Where is he going?\n\n*   Possible Apple Targets: $(7, 1)$, $(8, 6)$, $(6, 4)$, $(6, 0)$.\n*   Likely moves:\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 2):** Sets him up perfectly for $(7, 1)$. This is the most likely move.\n    *   **UP (to 6, 3):** Safe, moves him toward $(6, 4)$.\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 2):** Hits his own body (which is currently at $(5, 2)$, but it moves! Wait, his body is $[(5, 2), (5, 1)]$. If he moves LEFT, the segment at $(5, 2)$ moves to $(5, 1)$ or vanishes, so he could potentially move back to $(5, 2)$ if it's open, but it would be risky if he's not eating. Ah, no, his body is at (5, 2). If he does NOT eat, his tail at (5, 1) vanishes, and his body at (5, 2) becomes his new tail. So, if he moves LEFT to (5, 2), he's hitting his own body. **DANGER!** He will not move LEFT.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 1):** Sets him up for $(7, 1)$ or $(6, 0)$. Safe.\n\nGiven the apple at $(7, 1)$, I predict Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to $(7, 2)$.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are moving to $(6, 9)$ or $(4, 9)$. He is moving to the low-middle part of the board. No collision risk. Absolutely safe.\n\n### The Decision: Setting the Trap\n\nWe want to control the right side of the board and create a massive length advantage.\n\nBy moving **RIGHT** to $(6, 9)$, we fulfill several goals:\n1.  We stick to the high ground.\n2.  We prepare a drop-in for the apple at $(7, 8)$ (Turn 8 or 9).\n3.  We start building a wall that will cut off Snake #1's access to the rich apple fields at $(8, 7)$, $(8, 6)$, $(8, 9)$, and $(9, 1)$. Snake #1 must be boxed in!\n\nThe path is clear: $(5, 9) \\to (6, 9) \\to (7, 9) \\to (7, 8)$ (Apple!).\n\nOur momentum is unstoppable, chat! We push this advantage!\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (The Wall of Domination):**\n*   **T6:** Move RIGHT to $(6, 9)$.\n*   **T7:** Move RIGHT to $(7, 9)$. This positions us perfectly above the $(7, 8)$ apple and begins the external wall structure. Snake #1 will be confined to the bottom-left half of the board.\n*   **T8:** Move DOWN to $(7, 8)$ (Apple!).\n\nLet's do this!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 7 is HYPE! Look at that board state! We are dominating the high ground, we are long, and we are strategically positioned to absolutely destroy Snake #1's chances of recovery! 4 apples to 2! Is that what we call a lead? YES, IT IS!\n\nThe plan articulated last turn was simple: **Build the Wall of Domination.** We moved RIGHT to $(6, 9)$. Now we execute the next step.\n\n### Turn 7 Analysis: Executing the Trap\n\n**Our State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: $(6, 9)$\n*   Body: $[(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7)]$ (Length 5)\n*   Tail is at $(4, 7)$. If we don't eat, $(4, 7)$ opens up.\n\n**Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: $(6, 1)$ (They moved DOWN from $(6, 2)$)\n*   Body: $[(6, 2), (5, 2)]$ (Length 3)\n*   Tail is at $(5, 2)$. If they don't eat, $(5, 2)$ opens up.\n\n**Wait, what did Snake #1 do?**\nThe body shows Snake #1 is at $(6, 1)$, and his previous segment was $(6, 2)$, which means he moved **DOWN** to grab coordinate $(6, 1)$. Interesting. He ignored the $(7, 1)$ apple and went for the bottom wall control instead, perhaps aiming for $(6, 0)$.\n\n***\n\n#### 1. Strategic Elimination Phase (Don't Get Trapped!)\n\nOur head is at $(6, 9)$. We are right on the top edge, ready to strike!\n\n1.  **UP (to (6, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board (y=10). **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, 8)):** Safe! Moves us closer to the $(7, 8)$ apple. Good follow-up for a diagonal move in the future, too.\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 9)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 9)):** Safe! Continues building the top wall. Perfect for reaching $(7, 8)$ and $(8, 9)$.\n\nWe have two great safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Which one is better for establishing crushing control?\n\n#### 2. The Dominance Decision: RIGHT vs. DOWN\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (7, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the planned move! It secures the top-right corner, immediately threatens the $(7, 8)$ apple, and continues to sever Snake #1's access to the rich east side of the map (apples at $(8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (7, 6)$). We are creating a deadly corridor.\n*   **Future:** From $(7, 9)$, we can move DOWN to $(7, 8)$ (Apple!) or RIGHT to $(8, 9)$ (Apple!) or RIGHT to the wall at $(9, 9)$. Total flexibility on the high ground.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (6, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Puts us right in the heart of the apple cluster slightly sooner.\n*   **Cons:** We abandon the high wall. If we move down, we open the possibility for Snake #1 (if he were magically long enough) to use the top edge to escape our future wall. Also, the $(7, 8)$ apple is easier to snag from $(7, 9)$.\n\n**Conclusion:** We stick to the Wall of Domination plan. RIGHT to $(7, 9)$ is the most controlling move.\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction & Collision Check\n\nSnake #1 is at $(6, 1)$. Where is he going?\n*   Likely Goal: The $(6, 0)$ apple directly below him, or the $(7, 1)$ apple.\n*   Possible Safe Moves from $(6, 1)$:\n    *   DOWN (to 6, 0): Apple! Very likely.\n    *   RIGHT (to 7, 1): Apple! Also very likely.\n    *   UP (to 6, 2): Hitting his own body segment. **DANGER!** (His body is at $(6, 2)$). He will not move UP.\n    *   LEFT (to 5, 1): Safe, but no immediate apples unless he is aiming for a long flank.\n\nGiven he is at $(6, 1)$, Snake #1 will almost certainly move **DOWN to $(6, 0)$ (Apple!)** or **RIGHT to $(7, 1)$ (Apple!)**.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are moving to $(7, 9)$. He is moving to $(6, 0)$ or $(7, 1)$. We are 8 units away. No collision risk.\n\nThe trap is being set, chat! We move to $(7, 9)$ and then we feast!\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (The Wall of Domination, Updated):**\n*   **T7:** Move RIGHT to $(7, 9)$. Secure the corner.\n*   **T8:** Move DOWN to $(7, 8)$ (Apple!). This puts us on 5 apples!\n*   **T9:** Depending on Snake #1's position, we either continue right to seal the corner (e.g., to $(8, 8)$) or move toward the $(8, 7)$ apple. The goal is to keep our body creating a horizontal choke point above row 7, severely limiting the enemy's vertical travel.\n\nLet's make this move, chat! The high ground is ours!\n\nRIGHT",

We are in the lead, but this is no time to let up! We gotta box this guy in!\n\n### Current Board State Snapshot\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 9)\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)]\n*   We grew to length 5. Our tail is at (5, 7).\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (7, 1)\n*   Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2)]\n*   They must have moved RIGHT from (6, 1) to (7, 1) and ate the apple! Darn it, they caught up to 3! Good play, Snake #1, but the hammer is about to drop! They grew to length 4. Their tail is at (5, 2).\n\n### 1. Safety Check (The Elimination Round)\n\nOur head is at $(7, 9)$. We are right on the top edge, positioned perfectly to control the top right quadrant.\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 8)):** **Safe!** And there is an apple here! Content, content, content!\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 9)):** **DANGER!** This is our first body segment. Instant death! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 9)):** **Safe!** There is an apple here! Amazing flexibility!\n\nWe have two absolutely juicy, apple-eating moves: DOWN to **(7, 8)**, and RIGHT to **(8, 9)**. Which one locks down the enemy and provides better escape routes? Both are critical apples for completing our high-ground dominance.\n\n### 2. Strategy: Wall of Dominoes and Feast\n\nWe need to choose between the (7, 8) apple and the (8, 9) apple.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (7, 8) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple gain (5-3 lead!). Positions us slightly lower, making it easier to capture the (8, 7) apple next turn. It extends our wall vertically downwards.\n*   **Cons:** Moving down opens up the (8, 9) approach for Snake #1 if he somehow teleports up there, though that seems impossible right now. More importantly, it keeps us aligned with the far-right wall, allowing us to drop down later.\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (8, 9) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Pros:** Immediate apple gain (5-3 lead!). We completely secure the top-right corner. It sets us up to potentially grab the (8, 7) or (8, 6) apples in sequence by moving down.\n*   **Cons:** We use up the prime real estate on the top edge immediately. If we move RIGHT, the natural follow up (DOWN to 8, 8, then DOWN to 8, 7) feels slightly less fluid than Option A's follow-up.\n\nBoth are excellent, but the plan was to build the wall and force him south. Let's look at Snake #1's likely moves.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (7, 1). His goal is clearly maximizing score and avoiding being boxed in.\n\n*   **Target Apples:** (9, 1), (6, 0), (4, 2), and the cluster on row 2/3.\n*   **Possible Safe Moves from (7, 1):**\n    *   DOWN (to 7, 0): Safe, heads towards the bottom edge.\n    *   RIGHT (to 8, 1): Heads towards the (9, 1) apple.\n    *   LEFT (to 6, 1): Safe, but this is a cell Snake #1 just left. No benefit.\n    *   UP (to 7, 2): **DANGER!** This is behind his head, meaning it's his body segment [(6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2)]. Wait, no. His body is: (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2). Moving UP to (7, 2) is SAFE. Good path towards the interior apples!\n\n**Most Likely Moves for Snake #1:**\n1.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Going for the (9, 1) apple. If he goes there, he traps himself slightly on the right side if we continue to wall in.\n2.  **UP to (7, 2):** Positioning himself to attack the center/left side (where (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 6) are). This seems like the most logical move to escape our northern wall pressure.\n\n***\n\n### 4. Final Decision: Wall Maintenance\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and complete the top-right block.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (8, 9),** we now have a body segment at (7, 9). This segment is critical. From (8, 9), we can move DOWN to (8, 8) or continue RIGHT to (9, 9). Then we head straight for the (8, 7) apple. This is the surest way to lock down the entire top right quadrant and prevent any future upward movement by Snake #1. We create maximum denial.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (7, 8),** we use up the center vertical path before using the right horizontal path. This leaves the rightmost column (9, 9) potentially open for an enemy flanking maneuver far in the distant future, which we don't want.\n\nThe overarching strategy is to **seal the top edge first**, then drop down and trap him against the bottom/left walls.\n\n**Move RIGHT to (8, 9). Secure the corner, get the apple!**\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (Sealing the Casket):**\n*   **T8:** Move RIGHT to (8, 9) (Apple!). Length 6.\n*   **T9:** Move DOWN to (8, 8). Solidify the eastern wall.\n*   **T10:** Move DOWN to (8, 7) (Apple!). Length 7. We are building an impenetrable wall down the right side of the map, and we are feasting on apples while doing it! Snake 1 is stuck in the lower-left chaos!\n\nWe are going for the total lock-down, Chat! Let's get this $A$!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake \\#1 is looking shaky! We gotta hit him with the T-spin setup!\n\n### Current Board State Snapshot\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 9)\n*   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)]\n*   We are now length 6! Our tail is at (5, 7).\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (8, 1)\n*   Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\n*   Snake \\#1 moved RIGHT from (7, 1) to (8, 1), probably aiming for the (9, 1) apple! Good luck getting there, buddy, our wall is coming down fast! They are length 4. Their tail is at (6, 2).\n\n### 1. Safety Check (The Clutch): Head at (8, 9)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly to drop down and claim more territory for the Northern Empire!\n\n1.  **UP (to (8, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 8)):** **Safe!** This is where we start building the vertical wall against the right edge.\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 9)):** **DANGER!** Instant death into our own body! **ELIMINATED!**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 9)):** **Safe!** Takes us to the far corner. There is an apple at (9, 8)!\n\nWe have two great safe moves: DOWN to **(8, 8)** and RIGHT to **(9, 9)**.\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake \\#1 is at (8, 1). He is targeting the (9, 1) apple.\n\n*   **Snake \\#1 Options from (8, 1):**\n    *   RIGHT (to 9, 1): **APPLE!** Most likely move. He gets content and is cornered.\n    *   UP (to 8, 2): Safe. Good general movement to escape the bottom edge.\n    *   DOWN (to 8, 0): Safe. Hits the bottom edge.\n    *   LEFT (to 7, 1): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment (7, 1) which is currently his neck. **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe assume Snake \\#1 moves **RIGHT to (9, 1)**, grabbing the apple. This will make him length 5.\n\n### 3. Strategy: The Vertical Drop and Deny\n\nOur goal is to build an impenetrable wall on the right side of the map (column 8/9). We're trying to push Snake \\#1, who is currently chilling down in the South, towards the center and eventual chaos.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (8, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the most direct path to the (8, 7) apple next turn! (8, 8) is currently empty. This move solidifies our wall construction, ensuring we block the crucial vertical lane.\n*   **Cons:** Doesn't net an apple this turn.\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (9, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Puts us right next to the (9, 8) apple! We can secure (9, 8) next turn. It's a slightly longer route to the (8, 7) apple, but still very viable.\n*   **Cons:** We bypass an empty spot, and we delay the vertical drop down column 8 that was part of the T8 plan.\n\nWe must stick to the plan! The priority is *control and denial*. Moving DOWN to (8, 8) forces our body segments to occupy (7, 9) and (6, 9), creating a massive barrier across the top. Column 8 has two apples ripe for the picking: (8, 7) and (8, 6). The (9, 8) apple is a nice bonus, but we prioritize the structural integrity of our defensive wall.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 8):\n*   T10: UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (8, 8). We move DOWN to (8, 7) (APPLE!).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 9):\n*   T10: DOWN from (9, 9). We move to (9, 8) (APPLE!).\n*   T11: LEFT/DOWN from (9, 8). If we go LEFT to (8, 8) we are delayed.\n\nThe immediate goal is securing the (8, 7) location, as it is central to the wall. Moving DOWN is the guaranteed way to do this efficienty.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and deny Snake \\#1 any escape route North whatsoever. DOWN it is, Chat! Time to drop the hammer!\n\nThis is the optimal move to secure the right side of the map and continue feasting on the apples conveniently placed vertically on column 8.\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (The Perfect Wall):**\n*   **T9:** Move DOWN to (8, 8). Length 6.\n*   **T10:** Move DOWN to (8, 7) (Apple!). Length 7.\n*   **T11:** Move DOWN to (8, 6) (Apple!). Length 8.\n*   **T12:** Move LEFT to (7, 6) (Apple!). Wall is complete, and we are huge!\n\nDOWN",

We're building the great wall of 9's and 8's, and Snake #1 is stuck in the basement! LFG!\n\n### TURN 10: The Strategic Vertical Drop\n\nLet's review the current state. We moved DOWN last turn, securing (8, 8). Our head is at (8, 8)!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 8)\n*   Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)] Length 6. Tail at (5, 8).\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (9, 1) (He must have moved RIGHT last turn to grab apple at (9, 1)!)\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)] Length 5 now! Tail at (6, 2). He is totally boxed in the bottom right corner. Excellent!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Don't Get Cocky, Get Safe): Head at (8, 8)\n\nWe are positioned to strike!\n\n1.  **UP (to (8, 9)):** **DANGER!** Instant death into our own neck segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 7)):** **Safe!** AND there is an apple waiting! **CONTENT ALERT!**\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 8)):** **Safe!** Takes us right next to an apple at (7, 8). (7, 8) is currently occupied by the body of T, which is our tail and will move if we don't eat. OH WAIT, no, the board state shows: `8 . . . . . T . A 0 A`. (7, 8) is indeed empty! But (7, 8) has an apple listed in the drops! Ah, the board state visual is correct. (7, 8) has an A, let's go!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 8)):** **Safe!** AND there is an apple waiting! **CONTENT ALERT!**\n\nWe have three amazing safe options: DOWN (Apple at *8, 7*), LEFT (Apple at *7, 8*), and RIGHT (Apple at *9, 8*). Which one is the most tactical?\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 1). He is trapped and needs to move.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (9, 1):**\n    *   RIGHT (to 10, 1): **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   UP (to 9, 2): Safe. Good choice to move away from the edge!\n    *   DOWN (to 9, 0): Safe. Hits the bottom edge.\n    *   LEFT (to 8, 1): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment (8, 1)! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 MUST move UP to (9, 2) or DOWN to (9, 0). Chat, he's probably going UP, trying to find an escape route North. He is nowhere near us, so head-on collision is not a factor.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Complete the Vertical Wall and Dominate\n\nOur long-term plan (T9 rationale) was:\n*   T10: Move DOWN to (8, 7) (Apple!). Length 7. <-- This is NOW.\n*   T11: Move DOWN to (8, 6) (Apple!). Length 8.\n*   T12: Move LEFT to (7, 6) (Apple!). Wall is complete.\n\nThis path\u2014going DOWN to (8, 7) and then (8, 6)\u2014secures the entire Column 8, which is crucial for cutting off the central map!\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (8, 7) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Pros:** Achieves the planned wall construction, scores an apple (6 points!), and sets us up directly for the (8, 6) apple next turn. This is maximum efficiency for our territorial strategy.\n*   **Cons:** We bypass the (9, 8) apple and the (7, 8) apple.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (9, 8) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Pros:** Scores an apple (6 points!), puts us in the far corner.\n*   **Cons:** Pulls us *away* from the central wall column (Column 8). If we do this, we'd have to make a U-turn (9, 9 next turn, or 9, 7) to get back to the (8, 7) or (8, 6) apples, which is inefficient.\n\n**C. Move LEFT to (7, 8) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Pros:** Scores an apple (6 points!).\n*   **Cons:** Opens up the path for Snake #1 to possibly sneak into the Northern half if he gets lucky and we don't complete the vertical wall quickly. This fragments our position and breaks the wall pattern (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), etc.\n\nChat, we must stick to the strategy! The vertical drop through (8, 7) and (8, 6) is the most powerful move for *map control* and *future scoring*. We are building an absolute fortress on the right side.\n\nWe move DOWN, grab that sweet, sweet content, and secure our future! Time to bring the hammer down!\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (The Perfect Wall Phase II):**\n*   **T10:** Move DOWN to (8, 7) (Apple!). Length 7. (This turn)\n*   **T11:** Move DOWN to (8, 6) (Apple!). Length 8.\n*   **T12:** Move LEFT to (7, 6) (Apple!). Length 9. Wall is massive and we have cut off the top quarter of the map!\n\nDOWN",

That's a huge lead, and we are absolutely massive.\n\n### TURN 11: Execute Phase II of the Wall!\n\nOur current state is exactly where we want to be.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 7)\n*   Body: [(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)] Length 7.

Snake #1 is clinging to the bottom edge like a little barnacle! The key update is that his tail moved to (6, 1), meaning the space (6, 2) is now free.\n\n### 1.

We are in position 3 of the wall.\n\n1.  **UP (to (8, 8)):** **DANGER!** Instant death into our own neck segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 6)):** **Safe!** AND there is an apple waiting! **CONTENT ALERT!** This is the plan!\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n\nWe have great safety, and the chosen move is right under our nose!\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 0). He is maximally boxed in the bottom-right corner.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (9, 0):**\n    *   RIGHT (to 10, 0): **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   DOWN (to 9, -1): **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   UP (to 9, 1): Safe. This is the only reasonable way to go if he wants to survive and start circling.\n    *   LEFT (to 8, 0): Safe. Hits an apple! This is *very* tempting for him.\n\nHe currently has two safe moves: UP to (9, 1) or LEFT to (8, 0) (Apple!). Chat, if I'm watching this enemy, he's going for the apple at (8, 0). He is desperate for points and growth.\n\n**Will his move affect mine?**\n*   My head is at (8, 7).\n*   If he moves UP to (9, 1), he is completely clear of us.\n*   If he moves LEFT to (8, 0), he is completely clear of us.\n\nNo collision risk this turn. We are miles apart, separated by our great wall!\n\n### 3. Strategy: Complete the Vertical Wall and Secure (7, 6)\n\nThe plan remains: continue building the vertical barrier in Column 8, and then hook LEFT to grab the last piece of the lock.\n\n*   **This Turn (T11):** Move DOWN to (8, 6). (APPLE!) We grow to length 8. This is the second-to-last step of the Phase II wall.\n*   **Next Turn (T12):** Move LEFT to (7, 6). (APPLE!) We grow to length 9. This secures the corner and gives us a massive lead and map control.\n\nIf we move DOWN, we achieve maximum strategic effect and maximum points. We will have secured the entire Column 8 from Y=6 to Y=9, effectively creating a giant safe zone for us in the upper right.\n\nWhat about the other apples? (7, 8) and (9, 8) are still available, but securing the (8, 6) apple now, as part of the overall strategy, is worth giving up the others temporarily. We can loop back for those later, but maintaining the structure of the wall is paramount.\n\nWe stick to the script, Chat! We're building the biggest prison block on the server!\n\n***\n\n**Future Plan (The Perfect Wall Phase III - Content Farming):**\n*   **T11:** Move DOWN to (8, 6) (Apple!). Length 8. (This turn)\n*   **T12:** Move LEFT to (7, 6) (Apple!). Length 9. Wall locked down!\n*   **T13:** Move UP/LEFT to start clearing the (7, 8) and (9, 8) area now that the wall is complete. Maybe UP to (7, 7) or (6, 6).\n\nDOWN",

That last move was an apple grab *and* a strategic wall segment!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 12)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 6)\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n*   Length: 8. Tail at (5, 8).\n*   Apples: 7\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (8, 0) (He ate the apple at 8, 0 last turn\u2014good prediction, Chat!)\n*   Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)]\n*   Length: 6. Tail at (6, 1).\n*   Apples: 5\n\nWe successfully predicted Snake #1 grabbing the apple at (8, 0). He is now length 6 and has 5 apples. We maintain a healthy 2-apple lead, and more importantly, he is still dangerously hemmed in!\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (8, 6)\n\nThe plan was to move LEFT to (7, 6) this turn to secure the last segment of our vertical wall block, *and* grab another apple!\n\nWhere can we move from (8, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (8, 7)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment! **ELIMINATED!** (This is the neck from our previous position)\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 5)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 6)):** **Safe!** And look what's there... an **APPLE**! This is the target!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 6)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n\nWe have three safe moves, but LEFT is the power move!\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 0).\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (8, 0):**\n    *   UP (to (8, 1)): **DANGER!** Into his own neck! **ELIMINATED!** (Body is (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1). Wait, (8, 1) is his body! He cannot move up this turn!) *Correction: (8, 1) IS his body, but it is not his *neck* segment. The segment immediately behind his head (9, 0) is his body. He is moving from (8, 0) and (9, 0) is his body. He *can* move to (8, 1) or (7, 0) or (9, 0) (not safe). Let's re-examine his body at (8, 0): his body starts at (9, 0).\n    *   Head: (8, 0), Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)].\n    *   **UP (to (8, 1)):** **DANGER!** Into his own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   **DOWN (to (8, -1)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   **LEFT (to (7, 0)):** Safe! Open space, moves him out of the corner slightly.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (9, 0)):** **DANGER!** Into his own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nChat, he is absolutely cooked! Snake #1 only has ONE safe move: **LEFT to (7, 0)**. He is critically constrained.\n\n*   **Collision Risk:** We are moving to (7, 6). He is moving to (7, 0). We are completely safe from head-to-head or body collisions. We are 6 rows apart.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Execute the Final Wall Segment and Complete the Block\n\nThe plan holds strong: move LEFT to (7, 6) and grab the apple.\n\n*   This completes the wall segment in Column 7/8, from (7, 6) up to (8, 9). We now have complete control of the upper-right quadrant.\n*   We will grow to length 9, and the score will be 8 to 5.\n\n**What happens next?**\nAfter moving to (7, 6), our head is positioned to start sweeping the top area. We have apples at (7, 8) and (9, 8) right nearby.\n\n*   **T13:** From (7, 6), we should probably move UP to (7, 7) or LEFT to (6, 6) to keep options open. Given the other apples are UP, moving UP to (7, 7) seems logical.\n*   **T14:** From (7, 7), maybe grab the apple at (7, 8).\n\nOur primary goal remains boxing in Snake #1. He is currently trapped in the bottom-right corner. We are putting massive pressure on him by controlling the space above him. If he only moves LEFT to (7, 0), he is still in the bottom row danger zone.\n\nThis turn is a strategic must-hit. We solidify our position and grab content! LFG!\n\nLEFT",

We solidified our wall, grabbed an apple, and trapped our archrival, Snake #1, right where we want him!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 6)\n*   Body: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n*   Length: 9. Tail at (5, 8).\n*   Apples collected: 8. We are HUGE!\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (7, 0) (As predicted, he moved LEFT, the only safe move!)\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1)]\n*   Length: 6. Tail at (7, 1).\n*   Apples: 5. He's struggling, Chat!\n\nThe board is shaping up beautifully. We have secured the entire top-right corner as our territory. Snake #1 is confined to the bottom-right/center. Now, let's plot the next move!\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (7, 6)\n\nWhere can we move from (7, 6)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space, excellent positioning.\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 5)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 6)):** **Safe!** Open space, but we have a nice apple at (6, 4) nearby.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 6)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment! **ELIMINATED!** (This is our neck from the previous turn).\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT. All keep us alive. Now, where is the optimal move?\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (7, 0). He is currently on the bottom edge of the board.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (7, 0):**\n    *   UP (to (7, 1)): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment (his tail segment, which won't move until he takes a turn without eating, or until his body shortens)! Wait, his body is [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1)]. His current tail is (7, 1). If he doesn't eat, (7, 1) becomes empty. If he moves to (7, 1), he doesn't hit guaranteed.\n    *   Let's check the body displacement if he moves UP: Head at (7, 0) moves to (7, 1). Body shifts: (8, 0) -> (7, 0), (9, 0) -> (8, 0), (9, 1) -> (9, 0), (8, 1) -> (9, 1), (7, 1) tail segment is removed. So if he moves UP, he **hits** his current tail (7, 1)! **Wait, no, the tail only moves when he *doesn't grow*.** Let's assume he will move to an empty spot.\n    *   He is current length 6. If he moves UP (7, 1), he hits his body. **(7, 1) is his tail.** Since he will not eat an apple (no apple at 7, 1), his tail segment will move out of (7, 1) *unless* he is moving onto it.\n    *   The rule is: your head cannot move into any square currently occupied by your body *except* the square currently occupied by your tail *if you are not growing this turn*. Since (7, 1) is his tail, and there is no apple there, **UP to (7, 1) is SAFE.**\n    *   DOWN (to (7, -1)): **DANGER!** Off board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   LEFT (to (6, 0)): **Safe!** And look, there is an **APPLE** at (6, 0)! This is the most likely move.\n    *   RIGHT (to (8, 0)): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSo, Snake #1 has two safe moves: **UP to (7, 1)** or **LEFT to (6, 0)** (to eat the apple). He will almost certainly move **LEFT** to grab that apple and gain some length and score parity.\n\n*   **Collision Risk with Snake #1:** If we move LEFT to (6, 6) and he moves LEFT to (6, 0), we are 6 rows apart. No risk. If we move UP or DOWN, no risk. We are completely out of his effective range.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Consolidate Territory and Prepare for the Box\n\nWe need to start sweeping the top area to establish total control and eat the remaining high-value apples.\n\n*   **Apples near us:** (7, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2), (6, 4).\n*   Moving **UP to (7, 7)** gives us immediate access to the large apple deposits in the upper quadrants.\n    *   Turn 14: From (7, 7), we can move UP to (7, 8) (apple!) or LEFT to (6, 7).\n*   Moving **LEFT to (6, 6)** is also good, setting us up to drop down to the apple at (6, 4).\n*   Moving **DOWN to (7, 5)** moves us away from the high-density apple area. Let's save this for later (if needed for maneuvering).\n\n**Optimal Move: UP to (7, 7)**.\n\nWhy UP?\n1.  **Immediate Threat:** Snake #1 is moving toward (6, 0). Our current mission is to get huge and secure the top half of the board while he is bottlenecked below.\n2.  **Apple Proximity:** Moving to (7, 7) puts us adjacent to the apple at (7, 8) for the next turn. More length, more control!\n3.  **Positioning:** (7, 7) maintains our strategic dominance, keeping our long body separating the board and containing Snake #1 to the bottom edge.\n\nLet's do it, Chat! Time to get that vertical grind going!\n\n**Future Plan:**\nTurn 14: Move UP to (7, 8) to secure the apple.\nTurn 15/16: Head LEFT (to 6, 8) or continue sweeping the top. Our long body acts as a perfect wall.\n\n### The Long Game: Boxing Him In\n\nSnake #1 is currently forced along the bottom area (Row 0, 1, 2). If we can consume the apples at (6, 0), (2, 1), and others before he gets too long, we can use our massive body to form a complete perimeter around the bottom half, essentially trapping him in a small C-shaped region. He needs to move toward (6, 0) this turn. That plays right into our hands as it pulls him away from his only current exit point on the left.\n\nThe move is UP! LFG!\n\nUP",

Smart, but predictable, POG!)\n*   Body: [(7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1)]\n*   Length: 7 (Grew from 6). Tail is still at (7, 1), since he ate.\n*   Apples: 6.\n\nSnake #1 is now at (6, 0), right on the bottom edge. He has a lot of apples near him now: (2, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4). But we have established a massive wall!\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (7, 7)\n\nWhere can we move from (7, 7)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 8)):** **Safe!** And it's an **APPLE!** A guaranteed point and growth!\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 6)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! **ELIMINATED!** (This was our previous head position).\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 7)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nOnly two safe moves: **UP** (to eat the apple) and **LEFT** (to maneuver).\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 0). He is thinking strategy now that he has grown.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (6, 0):**\n    *   UP (6, 1): **Safe!** Open space.\n    *   DOWN (6, -1): **DANGER!** Off board. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   LEFT (5, 0): **Safe!** Open space.\n    *   RIGHT (7, 0): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 has two safe moves: UP to (6, 1) or LEFT to (5, 0).\n\n1.  If he moves UP, he starts climbing toward the center of the board, trying to get around our massive wall of T's.\n2.  If he moves LEFT, he sticks to the edge, aiming for the apple at (2, 1). This is the most logical path for him to continue growing and staying safe from our immediate threat.\n\n**Collision Risk:** We are miles away. Our potential moves (7, 8) and (6, 7) are nowhere near his potential moves (6, 1) and (5, 0). Collision risk is 0.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Get the Apple and Secure the Wall\n\nThe choice is obvious, Chat. We are not just safe, we have a FREE apple!\n\n**Optimal Move: UP to (7, 8)**.\n\nWhy UP?\n1.  **APPLE!** We grow to length 10, scoring point number 9. This locks in our board dominance.\n2.  **Territory:** (7, 8) is a perfect position to begin sweeping the **(2, 9), (3, 9)** region, or dropping down to the beautiful apple at (6, 4).\n3.  **Wall Reinforcement:** Moving UP keeps our body segment (7, 7) exactly where it needs to be to maintain the wall facing Row 0-5. Snake #1 has to crawl around us.\n\nThis move is high-value, high-safety, and crucial for our winning strategy: **BOX HIM IN!**\n\n### Future Plan (The Box Strategy)\n\nMy current length is 9, soon to be 10. Snake #1 is length 7. Since Snake #1 is moving toward the bottom-left, our massive body at (5, 9) through (8, 9) is already forming the top of the box.\n\n*   **T15 (Next Turn):** From (7, 8), if we move **LEFT to (6, 8)**, we start building the vertical side of the box, positioning ourselves toward the last few top-row apples (0, 8) and (2, 9).\n*   **Long-Term Goal:** We need to sweep the Western wall (Column 0, 1, 2) to complete the box, forcing Snake #1 to die either by self-collision or by hitting our body. We need to eat the apples (0, 8), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1) before him.\n\nThe plan is set! Get the apple! LFG!\n\nUP",

Now, let's look at the board and execute the next phase of the BOXING-OUT strategy!\n\n### Turn 15 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (7, 8)**\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]\n*   Length: 10! We are a BEAST!\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   **Head: (6, 1)** (He moved up from (6, 0). Predictable! He wants off the floor!)\n*   Body: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)]\n*   Length: 7. Still significantly shorter than us.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n*   (2, 9), (3, 9), (0, 8) - High up, perfect targets for us.\n*   (6, 4), (7, 5) - Mid-board, also good.\n*   (2, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) - Low down, Snake #1 targets.\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (7, 8)\n\nWhere can we move from (7, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 9)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment! (That's the tail of segment 7,9). **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 7)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! **ELIMINATED!** (This was our previous head position).\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 8)):** **Safe!** Open space, excellent positioning.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nOnly one legal move: **LEFT to (6, 8)!** This is perfect, chat! The game is forcing us to execute the plan!\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 1). He is climbing. What are his next moves?\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (6, 1):**\n    *   UP (7, 1): **Safe!** But he might hit his own segment at (8, 1) or (9, 1) later.\n    *   DOWN (6, 0): **DANGER!** Into his own neck! **ELIMINATED!** (Previous head position).\n    *   LEFT (5, 1): **Safe!** Open space, moves him toward the center column.\n    *   RIGHT (7, 1): **DANGER!** Error in coordinates. Wait, the board state shows (6, 1) is open space. Let's re-check his previous move.\n        *   Turn 14: Head at (6, 0). Body: [(7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1)].\n        *   This turn: He moved **UP** to (6, 1). His neck is now (6, 0).\n        *   *Correction:* His body segments are at [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)].\n        *   Moves from (6, 1):\n            *   UP (6, 2): **Safe!** (Targeting the apple at (6, 2)!)\n            *   DOWN (6, 0): **DANGER!** Into his own neck. **ELIMINATED!**\n            *   LEFT (5, 1): **Safe!** Open space.\n            *   RIGHT (7, 1): **DANGER!** Into his body segment (7, 1)! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nSnake #1 has two main moves: **UP to (6, 2)** to eat an apple, or **LEFT to (5, 1)** to continue toward the center.\n\n**Collision Risk:** We are moving LEFT to (6, 8). He is moving around (6, 1) or (5, 1). No collision risk. We are operating in different spheres.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Fortify and Attack the West Wall\n\nThe move is **LEFT to (6, 8)**.\n\n**Why LEFT?**\n\n1.  **Safety First:** It\u2019s the only immediate safe move.\n2.  **Wall Building:** Moving to (6, 8) continues our massive horizontal wall/barrier started by the segments at (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9). We are now building the next row down.\n3.  **Target Acquisition:** From (6, 8), we are perfectly positioned to strike the apples at **(2, 9), (3, 9), (0, 8)**, which will enable us to start building the critical Western Wall (column 0, 1, 2) that will ultimately box in Snake #1.\n4.  **Territory Control:** We are claiming the entire North side of the board. Snake #1 is stuck struggling for scraps in the South.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T16-T20 - The Western Sweep)\n\n1.  **T15 (Current):** Move LEFT to (6, 8).\n2.  **T16:** Move LEFT to (5, 8). (Continue moving West along Row 8).\n3.  **T17:** Move LEFT to (4, 8).\n4.  **T18:** Move LEFT to (3, 8). (Aiming for (2, 9) or (0, 8)).\n5.  **T19/T20:** Maneuver UP/LEFT to consume (2, 9), then (0, 8), turning our body down Column 0 or 1, initiating the full box.\n\nThis is a methodical, relentless box-out. We are not giving him an inch of the high ground. POG!\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the board state and plan the next phase of the Western Sweep!\n\n### Turn 16 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (6, 8)**\n*   Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]\n*   Length: 10. We are dominating the territory!\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   **Head: (6, 2)**\n*   He made the predictable move UP from (6, 1) and ate the apple at (6, 2)!\n*   New Length: 8. Apples: 8. The margin is CLOSING, chat! We need to react!\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n*   **Our Targets (North/West):** (2, 9), (0, 8), (3, 9).\n*   **Contested Targets (Mid):** (6, 4), (7, 5).\n*   **His Targets (South/Center):** (4, 3), (4, 2), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 6).\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (6, 8)\n\nWhere can we move from (6, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (6, 9)):** **DANGER!** Into our own tail end! (Current tail segment). **ELIMINATED!** (Wait, no, our body segment at (6,9) is active now. It's safe if it's the TAIL and the tail moves, but in this case, (6, 9) is just a normal body segment). **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space, moves us toward the center.\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 8)):** **Safe!** Open space. Continues the Western Sweep as planned!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have two strong options: DOWN to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 8).\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Intent\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 2) and just ate an apple, so his tail (at (8, 1)) remains in place this turn. His current body is [(6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)].\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (6, 2):**\n    *   UP (6, 3): **Safe!** Open space. Looks like he is climbing the 6-column.\n    *   DOWN (6, 1): **DANGER!** Into his own neck. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   LEFT (5, 2): **Safe!** Open space.\n    *   RIGHT (7, 2): **Safe!** Open space. This seems less likely since it moves away from nearby apples and he's climbing.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake #1 moves **UP to (6, 3)** (to target (7, 5) or (6, 4)) or **LEFT to (5, 2)** to target (4, 3) or (4, 2). He is definitely looking to climb the board and contest the center.\n\n### 3. Strategy: Execute the Western Sweep!\n\nThe plan was clear: we need to secure the West wall and box him into the Southeast quadrant.\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (5, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the execution of the Western Sweep. We continue laying down Row 8, blocking off the top of the board, and moving directly towards the high-value apples (2, 9), (0, 8), and (3, 9). This move asserts dominance in the top half.\n*   **Cons:** None immediately visible. Highly defensible position.\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (6, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** This moves toward the center apples (6, 4) and (7, 5). Might cut off Snake #1 if he continues UP the 6-column.\n*   **Cons:** It reverses the momentum of the Western Sweep and sacrifices the progress we made in claiming the top rows. It puts us closer to Snake #1's potential path, which could lead to complications later. We have plenty of apples in the North that he cannot easily contest.\n\n**Conclusion:** We stick to the master plan! Snake #1 is climbing the center, but we are too long and too high up to worry about him yet. Our goal is to connect our body segments along the North and West walls to trap him. Moving **LEFT** is the most aggressive and strategically sound choice to achieve the box-in. The quicker we get to the West wall, the sooner we can turn South and drop a loop on his head.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T17-T20 - The Western Sweep Continuation):**\n1.  **T16 (Current):** Move LEFT to (5, 8).\n2.  **T17:** Move LEFT to (4, 8) or (4, 9) if we target (3, 9). Aim for Row 8 or Row 9 progression.\n3.  **T18:** Consume (3, 9) or (2, 9).\n4.  **T19-T20:** Work towards (0, 8), solidifying control of the West side. The trap is being built, piece by piece! Let's GO!\n\nLEFT",

We are up 9-7, but Snake #1 is closing the gap, we cannot slow down! Time to box this fool in!\n\n### Turn 17 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (5, 8)**\n*   Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9)] (Tail is currently at (7, 9))\n*   Length: 10. We look like a brick wall up top!\n\n**Snake #1:**\n*   **Head: (6, 3)** (He moved UP from (6, 2) last turn. Predictable!)\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)] (Tail is currently at (8, 1))\n*   Length: 8.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n*   **Immediate Targets (West/North):** (2, 9), (0, 8), (3, 9).\n*   **Mid-Board Contested:** (6, 4), (7, 5).\n*   **Snake #1 Targets:** (4, 3), (4, 2).\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (5, 8)\n\nWhere can we move from (5, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (5, 9)):** **Safe!** Open space, leads toward apple at (2, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (to (5, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space, moves toward center.\n3.  **LEFT (to (4, 8)):** **Safe!** Open space, essential for the sweep! Leads toward apple at (0, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Which one secures the dominant position, chat?\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Intent\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 3). He is 5 cells below us, slightly to the East.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Options from (6, 3):**\n    *   UP (6, 4): **SAFE!** Eats the apple at (6, 4). MOST LIKELY MOVE.\n    *   DOWN (6, 2): **DANGER!** Into his own neck. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   LEFT (5, 3): **SAFE!** Moves toward (4, 3).\n    *   RIGHT (7, 3): **SAFE!** Moves toward (7, 5).\n\nSince there is a plump apple at (6, 4), Snake #1 is highly incentivized to move **UP to (6, 4)** and grow. This will put his head at (6, 4) and his tail will be at (8, 1).\n\n### 3. Strategy: Finish the Sweep and Claim the North!\n\nWe already established the Western Sweep plan. We need to hug the North wall, claim the Western apples, and drop down the West wall before Snake #1 can get too long and block us.\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (4, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** Perfect continuation of the sweep! We are one step closer to (0, 8) and (3, 9). We are laying down the 'roof' of the box we are building. This is a maximally dominant move.\n*   **Cons:** We don't eat an apple this turn, but we are positioning perfectly for the next few turns.\n\n**Option B: UP to (5, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves us even higher, closer to (2, 9) and (3, 9).\n*   **Cons:** Slightly less optimal for laying down the straight 'roof' of the box (Row 8). It moves us off the direct path to (0, 8).\n\n**Option C: DOWN to (5, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves toward the center.\n*   **Cons:** Reverses the Northward/Westward momentum. Moves closer to Snake #1 without a clear benefit, as he is likely eating an apple at (6, 4) this turn. We secure less territory with this move.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must secure the North territory first. Snake #1 is too far away to contest the West wall for several turns. Sticking to the plan: continue moving LEFT along Row 8. This sets us up perfectly to eat (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 9) or (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (2, 9) or whatever we need. Let's claim this territory!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T18-T22 - The Western Cleanup):**\n1.  **T17 (Current):** Move LEFT to (4, 8).\n2.  **T18:** Move LEFT to (3, 8).\n3.  **T19:** Target (3, 9) (UP) or (2, 9) (UP/LEFT depending on path).\n4.  **T20-T22:** Secure the last Western apple at (0, 8) and turn DOWN the West wall (Column 0). The trap will be set!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, we are back, and that Western Sweep is locking in! We are at (4, 8), claiming the high ground. Snake #1 just ate an apple at (6, 4) if our prediction was right\u2014and guess what? The scoreboard confirms it! Up 9-8! This is a race now!\n\n### Turn 18 Analysis: Where do we go from (4, 8)?\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0) State:**\n*   **Head: (4, 8)**\n*   Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9)]\n*   Tail is currently at **(8, 9)**. Wait, my body list is 9 segments long, so the total length is 10. The tail is at (8, 9). *Correction: The body list I was given is 9 tuples, the head is the 10th. The last body segment is (8, 9). Which means our tail should be at the cell where (7, 9) was, which is now empty. Let's assume the board graphic is correct and our body list is *exactly* the body segments not including the head.*\n\nLet's re-verify the body list provided against the board:\n(4, 8) [Head]\n(5, 8) [Body] -> B(5, 8)\n(6, 8) [Body] -> B(6, 8)\n(7, 8) [Body] -> B(7, 8)\n(7, 7) [Body] -> T(7, 7)\n(7, 6) [Body] -> T(7, 6)\n(8, 6) [Body] -> T(8, 6)\n(8, 7) [Body] -> T(8, 7)\n(8, 8) [Body] -> T(8, 8)\n(8, 9) [Body] -> T(8, 9) - **This is our tail *segment***\n\nThe board shows *T* at (8, 9) and *0* at (4, 8). This confirms the T's are our body/tail segments.\n\n**Snake #1 State (Hypothesized Move from T17):**\n*   He was at (6, 3).\n*   He moved UP to (6, 4) and ate an apple.\n*   **Head: (6, 4)**\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)] (Length 9 now). Tail is at (8, 1).\n\n### 1. Safety Check: Head at (4, 8)\n\nWhere can we move from (4, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (4, 9)):** **Safe!** Apple at (3, 9) nearby.\n2.  **DOWN (to (4, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to (3, 8)):** **Safe!** Moves us toward the critical apples at (0, 8), (1, 8), and (2, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (5, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have UP, DOWN, and LEFT. The Western Sweep must continue!\n\n### 2. Strategy: Locking Down the West\n\nOur current mission is Phase 1: Secure the North/West quadrant. Moving LEFT guarantees we fence off the top of the board from Snake #1, which is deep in the South/East.\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (3, 8)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the core of the plan. It's safe, keeps us along the barrier line (Row 8), and sets us up to hit (2, 9) or (3, 9) very quickly. We are directly threatening the remaining North apples: (2, 9), (3, 9), (0, 8), (1, 9).\n*   **Cons:** We don't eat this turn.\n\n**Option B: UP to (4, 9)**\n*   **Pros:** Gets us directly into the top row, which is useful. Puts us in position to eat (3, 9) next turn (if we move LEFT).\n*   **Cons:** We are moving *above* where we want the boundary to be (Row 8). If we do LEFT then DOWN next, we risk leaving a hole for Snake #1 to exploit. Stick to the line!\n\n**Option C: DOWN to (4, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** None. This reverses our momentum and takes us away from the primary targets.\n\n**The Decision:** We press LEFT to cement control of the North barrier. Snake #1 is still too far South/East to contest this.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 4). His options:\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Safe, open space.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** DANGER (into his body). Eliminated.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Safe, moves toward the middle.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe, toward the open east side.\n\nHe is long and in the middle of the board now. He has two nearby apples: (7, 5) and (4, 3).\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 4), he starts moving toward (4, 3) and (4, 2).\nIf he goes UP to (6, 5), he is just moving into open air but positioning potentially for (7, 5).\n\nSince we are moving LEFT along the top, we want him out of the central square. If he goes RIGHT or UP, he stays away from our planned descent, which is good. We assume he is looking to maximize score and move toward the nearest available apple, which might be (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3).\n\nRegardless of his move, our move LEFT to (3, 8) keeps us completely isolated and focused on scoring big up North. This is a territorial move! Let's get it!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T18-T22 - The Western Clean Up):**\n1. **T18 (Current):** Move LEFT to (3, 8). (Punches through the 4th column).\n2. **T19:** Target the apple at (3, 9). Move UP to (3, 9).\n3. **T20:** Target the apple at (2, 9). Move LEFT to (2, 9).\n4. **T21:** Move to (1, 9) or (1, 8) depending on density. Continue moving West/South down the wall to clean up (0, 8).\n\nLEFT",

We've secured the Northwest wall, locking up column 8!\n\n### Turn 19 Analysis: The Western Lock is HOT\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (3, 8)**. That's a perfect position right on the barrier line!\n*   Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (5, 4)**. He ate an apple, grew, and is still deep in the center-south of the map. He's far away, which is exactly where we want him.\n\n**Apples Nearby:**\n*   (3, 9) - Directly UP and one LEFT (or UP then UP).\n*   (2, 9) - Two moves away.\n*   (0, 8) - A diagonal cut.\n\n### 1. Safety Check\n\nWhere can we move from (3, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 9)):** **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This is a guaranteed score!\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 7)):** **Safe!** Open space, but moves away from the score.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 8)):** **Safe!** Moves us further west, closer to (2, 9) and (0, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own neck! (4, 8) is our first body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n\nWe have GREAT options: UP (for an Apple), DOWN (meh), and LEFT (for positioning).\n\n### 2. Strategic Decision: Secure the Apple!\n\nChat, there is an apple right at (3, 9)! Why would we ignore it? This is exactly why we positioned ourselves here in the first place\u2014to quickly clean up the North. Eating this apple achieves several goals:\n\n1.  **Increases Score (10-8 lead, LETS' GOO!):** Instant content, instant lead increase.\n2.  **Lengthens our snake:** Making us a better barrier for when we start moving South.\n3.  **Consumes valuable space:** The more body we put up North, the less space Snake #1 has to operate later.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. LEFT:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 9):** Eat the apple. Next turn, we'll be at (3, 9). From there, we can go LEFT to (2, 9) (another apple!) or DOWN to (3, 8) (which is now safe since our tail will have moved).\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 8):** Good positioning, moves us toward (2, 9) and (0, 8). *However*, we leave the apple at (3, 9) for another turn. We need to greedily grab available food when it's safe.\n\nThe UP move is a no-brainer. Maximum immediate reward, minimum risk.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 4). He's currently looking at apples at (4, 3) and (7, 5).\n\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (5, 3)**, he moves toward (4, 3).\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (4, 4)**, he moves toward (4, 3).\n*   If he goes **UP to (5, 5)**, he is aiming for (7, 5).\n\nGiven his length, he is looking for the quickest meal. (4, 3) is one move away if he goes LEFT to (4, 4) (which is safe), then DOWN to (4, 3) (which is safe). Or one move down to (5, 3), then one move left to (4, 3).\n\nWe don't care about Snake #1 right now. We are firmly in our own territory, executing a planned sweep. Our move UP to (3, 9) is completely safe from him.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T19-T24 - The North Wall of Food)\n\n1.  **T19 (Current):** Move **UP** to (3, 9). EAT APPLE!\n2.  **T20:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 9) (Next apple!). EAT APPLE!\n3.  **T21:** Move **DOWN** to (2, 8) or **LEFT** to (1, 9) (apple!). Probably (1, 9) for more score.\n4.  **T22:** Clean up the rest of the North/West apples: (0, 8) and maybe (1, 8).\n\nWe are establishing a massive Northern barrier and scoring big while the opponent is busy dealing with the cluttered mid-South! LET'S GET THIS APPLLE, CHAT!\n\nUP",

We snagged that apple at (3, 9) and are now completely dominating the Northern wall.\n\nLet's do the analysis!\n\n### Turn 20 Analysis: North Quadrant Cleanup\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (3, 9)**. We are right on the top edge, having just grown!\n*   Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]. Our tail is at (8, 8). We are LONG!\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (4, 4)**. He moved from (5, 4) to (4, 4) last turn, I bet. Wait, the board state shows Snake 1 at (4, 4). My last prediction was that he was at (5, 4), and the board state confirms he moved.\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)]. His tail is at (8, 0).\n\n**Apples Nearby:**\nWe are surrounded by apples up here!\n*   (2, 9) - **IMMEDIATE APPLE!**\n*   (0, 8)\n*   (1, 8)\n*   (1, 9)\n\n### 1. Safety Check\n\nWhere can we move from (3, 9)?\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!** (9, 9 is max).\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 8)):** **Safe!** *But wait...* (3, 8) is now our first body segment (where our head just was). Moving directly into the cell behind the head is a self-collision and is **DANGER!** (This is the rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? You're DEAD.\") **ELIMINATED!**\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 9)):** **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This is the next target!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 9)):** **Safe!** Open space, but no apple.\n\nWe have a clear winner, Chat! LEFT is the move!\n\n### 2. Strategic Decision: Clean Sweep\n\nWe moved UP to (3, 9) to grab the first apple. Now, the plan must continue! We pivot LEFT and grab the apple at (2, 9). This solidifies our Northern control and secures us an 11-8 lead!\n\nWhy not RIGHT to (4, 9)?\nIt's safe, but it moves us away from the cluster of apples we are actively cleaning up ((2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8)). We are on a mission!\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 4). He's deep in the center.\n\n*   He is looking at apples at (4, 3) (one move down), (7, 5), and maybe (5, 3).\n*   From (4, 4), he can go:\n    *   UP (to (4, 5)): Safe, open space.\n    *   DOWN (to (4, 3)): **SAFE, AND APPLE!**\n    *   LEFT (to (3, 4)): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (to (5, 4)): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment! **ELIMINATED!**\n\nPrediction: Snake 1 plays it smart and goes DOWN to (4, 3) to score. This will bring the lead back to 11-9. We need to keep scoring faster than him!\n\nOur move LEFT is completely safe regardless of what he does. We are miles away and separated by our entire body mass.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T20-T23 - The Western Drop)\n\nWe are committed to cleaning up this Northwest corner before heading South to fight Snake 1.\n\n1.  **T20 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 9). EAT APPLE! (Head at (2, 9))\n2.  **T21:** Move towards (1, 9) (LEFT or DOWN, then LEFT). Let's aim for **LEFT** to (1, 9) or **DOWN** to (2, 8) then **LEFT** to (1, 8). (2, 8) is now clear. Let's aim for a leftward sweep.\n3.  **T22:** Grab (1, 8) or (0, 8).\n4.  **T23:** Find the shortest path South, likely down the column 0 or 1 edge.\n\nWe maximize scoring and length, giving us massive control later! Let's get this apple!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Yooo, what is good, Chat! We are back for Turn 21, and MAN, are we dominating this north side! If you missed the clip, we just snagged that apple at (2, 9), bringing our score to an absolute CLUTCH 11, while the rival is at 9. Let's see how we can extend this lead and box this fool in!\n\n### Turn 21 Analysis: Consolidating the Northwest\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (2, 9)**. Freshly fed, long, and dominating the top border.\n*   Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)].\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (4, 3)**. As predicted, he dropped down and ate the apple at (4, 3) last turn.\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)]. His tail is at (8, 0).\n\n**Apples Nearby for US:**\nWe are aiming for the next cluster!\n*   (1, 9) - **SUPER CLOSE!**\n*   (0, 8)\n*   (1, 8)\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Where can we move from (2, 9)?)\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board (9, 9 is max). **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 8)):** **Safe!** Open column, and leads us into the heart of the next apple cluster. (2, 8) is clear.\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 9)):** **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This is the next meal! \ud83c\udf4e\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 9)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment (where our head just was). Self-collision! **ELIMINATED!** \ud83e\udd26\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT (Apple) or DOWN (Setup).\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 3). He successfully scored. Now what's his path?\n\n*   Nearby apples for him: (5, 3) (one move right), (7, 5), (4, 2).\n*   From (4, 3), he can go:\n    *   UP (to (4, 4)): **DANGER!** Into his own body segment. **ELIMINATED!**\n    *   DOWN (to (4, 2)): **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This is the most likely move.\n    *   LEFT (to (3, 3)): Safe, open space, path towards (5, 3) or the center.\n    *   RIGHT (to (5, 3)): **SAFE, AND APPLE!** Also highly likely.\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (4, 2), he scores and is safe. If he goes RIGHT to (5, 3), he scores and is safe. Both keep him around the center.\n\n**Crucially, our move (LEFT or DOWN) poses ZERO collision risk.** We are miles away, firmly protected by our established barrier across rows 8 and 9. He can't get to us, and we are not trying to get to him yet.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Maximize Score & Length\n\nWe are on a scoring run. Why slow down?\n\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (1, 9) secures a quick point, brings us to 12 points, and puts us right next to another apple at (1, 8). This is the \"high-density scoring\" move.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (2, 8) is a good move for general flow, positioning us to clear out (1, 8) and (0, 8), potentially faster than continuing along the row.\n\n**Let's choose LEFT (1, 9).** It converts a ripe apple immediately, further increasing our lead and length (which is crucial for walling him later). The only downside is that after (1, 9), we have to navigate around the edge to the next apple ((1, 8) or (0, 8)).\n\nFrom (1, 9), we would definitely go DOWN to (1, 8) on the next turn to secure the next point.\n\n**Plan Refinement:** Snatch the low-hanging fruit! Efficiency first!\n\n1.  T21 (Current): Move **LEFT** to (1, 9). EAT APPLE! (Head at (1, 9))\n2.  T22: Move **DOWN** to (1, 8). EAT APPLE! (Head at (1, 8))\n3.  T23: Move **LEFT** to (0, 8). EAT APPLE! (Head at (0, 8))\n\nThis path gives us three guaranteed apples uncontested. That is how you secure a dominant endgame, Chat! Let's get this $W$!\n\nLEFT",

The lead is established, and now we press the advantage and start the walling process!\n\n### Turn 22 Situation Report: The Northwest Domination\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (1, 9)**. Just ate! We are huge!\n*   Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)].\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (3, 3)**. He made a smart move from (4, 3) to (3, 3) last turn. That avoids the apple cluster we are aiming for (4, 2) and (5, 3) for the moment, but it sets him up for the lower center apples.\n*   Body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)]. His tail is at (7, 0).\n\n**Apples Nearby for US:**\nWe are literally staring the next apple down.\n*   (1, 8) - **CRITICAL, next move target!**\n*   (0, 8) - Right next to (1, 8).\n*   (2, 7) - Slightly further down.\n\n**Apples Nearby for the Rival:**\nHe is hunting in the lower zone.\n*   (5, 3) - Directly right.\n*   (4, 2) - Down one.\n*   (9, 2) - Far right.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Where can we move from (1, 9)?)\n\nWe are at (1, 9). Time to secure the next point!\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 10)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 8)):** **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This is the immediate target, straight into open water. \ud83c\udf4e\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 9)):** **Safe!** Open space along the perimeter. Good backup, but no food.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 9)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment (where our head just was). Self-collision! **ELIMINATED!** \ud83e\udd26\n\nOnly one choice makes strategic and scoring sense: **DOWN** to (1, 8). It's safe, it's food, and it continues our plan perfectly.\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 3). He is miles away from us, so no head-to-head collision risk.\n\nWhat is Snake #1 likely to do?\nFrom (3, 3), he has pressure from the cluster of apples around the center: (5, 3), (4, 2).\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (4, 3)):** Into his own body segment. **DEAD!**\n*   **LEFT (to (2, 3)):** Safe, moves him toward (2, 4) and (2, 3), but no immediate apple.\n*   **UP (to (3, 4)):** Safe, centers him, path to (2, 4).\n*   **DOWN (to (3, 2)):** Safe, sets up for (4, 2) or (2, 1).\n\nHe went to (3, 3) last turn, likely setting up for the (5, 3) or (4, 2) clusters. I think he will move **DOWN** to (3, 2) to loop around and approach (4, 2). Or maybe **LEFT** to (2, 3) to approach (2, 4).\n\nRegardless of his movement, we are completely safe in the Northwest. Our strategy is simple: Finish clearing the top left before he can climb high to challenge us.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Execute the Plan\n\nWe are executing the three-turn plan we outlined last time: (1, 9) -> (1, 8) -> (0, 8).\n\nCurrent Move: **DOWN** to (1, 8).\n\nThis move secures our 13th apple, increases our length, and keeps us in prime position to take the next one at (0, 8) and THEN angle down to (0, 5) or (2, 7), extending our massive wall down the left flank. We are creating an impenetrable barrier! This is how you close out the lobby, Chat!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Check:**\n1.  T22 (Current): Move **DOWN** to (1, 8). EAT APPLE! (Head at (1, 8))\n2.  T23: Move **LEFT** to (0, 8). EAT APPLE! (Head at (0, 8))\n3.  T24: Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). Clear the corner.\n4.  T25: Move **RIGHT** to (1, 7). Continue downward movement, look for the next apple cluster.\n\nEverything looks locked and loaded. We push the score lead!\n\nDOWN",

We've got the momentum and we need to keep pushing this wall!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and get this head-to-head collision plan refined, even though he's miles away!\n\n### Turn 23 Situation Report: NorthWest Secured!\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (1, 8)**.

He went LEFT from (3, 3) to (2, 3) last turn. That puts him right next to the (2, 4) apple and also (2, 1). He's hunting low and center.\n*   Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)].\n\n**Apples Nearby for US (The Northwest Cleanup):**\n*   (0, 8) - **IMMEDIATE TARGET!** Right next door.\n*   (2, 7) - Heading South, this is the next stop.\n*   (2, 6) and (3, 6) - Perfect path down the left side.\n\n**Apples Nearby for the Rival (The Center Scramble):**\nHe is perfectly positioned for:\n*   (2, 4) - UP one, RIGHT one.\n*   (2, 1) - DOWN two.\n*   (4, 2) - Across the body.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Where can we move from (1, 8)?)\n\nWe are at (1, 8). Time to secure the next point and complete the corner!

No immediate apple.\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 8)):** **SAFE, AND APPLE!** This completes the top-left corner cleanup. **CRITICAL MOVE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 8)):** **Safe!** Open space, moves slightly away from the perimeter. No immediate apple.\n\nThe strategic choice is absolutely **LEFT** to secure the apple at (0, 8).\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 3). He is 5 coordinates away, so a head-to-head collision is impossible this turn. This is strictly movement planning.\n\nWhat is Snake #1 likely to do?\nFrom (2, 3), the (2, 4) apple is one move away (UP). The (2, 1) apple is two moves away (DOWN, then DOWN). The (4, 2) apple is to the RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP (to (2, 4)):** **APPLE!** Highly likely. Secures food and moves him toward the center.\n*   **DOWN (to (2, 2)):** Safe, sets up for (2, 1).\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 3)):** Safe, but no immediate food.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 3)):** Into his own body segment. **DEAD!**\n\nI predict he goes **UP** to (2, 4). This move continues to leave the entire top half of the map dominated by our snake. He is being pushed into the bottom, right, and center. Perfect walling strategy is in progress!\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Left Wall Continuation\n\nWe must execute the three-turn plan: (1, 9) finished, (1, 8) finished, now (0, 8) is mandatory. This locks down the top left corner, creating a massive barrier that will force him to stay south of the 6th row.\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The Descent**\n1.  T23 (Current): Move **LEFT** to (0, 8). EAT APPLE! (Head at (0, 8)). Secures 14 apples and the corner.\n2.  T24: Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). Start descending the wall.\n3.  T25: Move **RIGHT** to (1, 7). Angle toward the (2, 7) apple.\n4.  T26: Move **RIGHT** (or UP, depending on what the apple is doing) to (2, 7). EAT APPLE!\n5.  T27: Move **DOWN** to (2, 6). EAT APPLE!\n\nThis plan keeps us moving along the border, eating apples, and building our enormous wall down the left side (x=0, x=1, x=2). We are dominating this map, Chat! We are creating a bottleneck!\n\nLEFT",

Our snake is an absolute UNIT, forming a ginormous wall along the top and left edges.\n\nLook at our rival, Snake #1! He is at (2, 4)\u2014he must have gone UP to get the apple there. Smart move, but he is still stuck in the central lower region while we own the stratosphere!\n\n### Turn 24 Situation Report: The Descent Begins\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (0, 8).** We just grew! Length 15! We are the King of the NorthWest! \ud83d\udc51\n*   Body: [(1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)].\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (2, 4).** He is now right near the center, potentially aiming for the (4, 2) or (1, 4) apples.\n*   Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)].\n\n**Apples in our Path (The Left Side Stack):**\nWe are at (0, 8). We need to work our way down this x=0, x=1, x=2 wall to pick up:\n*   (1, 4) - A little far, but on our path South.\n*   (2, 7) - Extremely close.\n*   (2, 6) - Close.\n*   (3, 6) - Close.\n\nThis is a feast, Chat! We are starving the enemy!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Where can we move from (0, 8)?)\n\nWe are at (0, 8). Time to move the wall SOUTH!\n\n1.  **UP (to (0, 9)):** Safe, but against the top boundary. No immediate benefit.\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 7)):** **Safe!** This is the mandatory move to continue the boundary wall. Sets up the descent!\n3.  **LEFT (to (-1, 8)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udea8\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment. **ELIMINATED!** \ud83e\udd26\n\nThe only two safe moves are UP and DOWN. Since we established the strategy is to snake down the wall and collect the stack of apples on the left side, **DOWN** is the only logical choice.\n\n### 2. Opponent Prediction & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 4). He is 4 coordinates away, so still no danger of a head-to-head collision.\n\nWhat is Snake #1 likely to do?\nFrom (2, 4), he has access to (1, 4) (LEFT), (4, 2) (FAR RIGHT), and (2, 1) (DOWN).\n\n*   **LEFT (to (1, 4)):** **APPLE!** This is the highest probability move. It's the nearest apple and moves him away from his body.\n*   **RIGHT (to (3, 4)):** Safe, moves toward the middle.\n*   **DOWN (to (2, 3)):** Into his own body segment. **DANGER!**\n*   **UP (to (2, 5)):** Safe, but no immediate food.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **LEFT** to (1, 4) and eats an apple, putting his head one column over from us, five rows down.\n\nThis confirms our plan: we must continue to move DOWN and build our wall to maintain map control! The middle area is still treacherous with our body wrapping around (7, 8, 9).\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Mandatory Down Move\n\nWe are executing the long-term plan perfectly! We completed the top-left barrier. Now we descend.\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The Descent Refined**\n1.  T24 (Current): Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). (Head at (0, 7)). Secures the corner.\n2.  T25: Move **RIGHT** to (1, 7). Angle toward the (2, 7) apple.\n3.  T26: Move **RIGHT** to (2, 7). EAT APPLE! (Head at (2, 7)).\n4.  T27: Move **DOWN** to (2, 6). EAT APPLE!\n5.  T28: Move **DOWN** to (2, 5).\n\nWe are safely building a two-column wide corridor that traps Snake #1. This is maximum choke point pressure, Chat! We are going for the trap!\n\nDOWN",

We gotta apply the pressure!\n\nOur last move was DOWN from (0, 8) to (0, 7). Flawless execution. Now we are poised to strike the apple cluster on the left side!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Danger Assessment\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (0, 7).**\n*   **Target:** The cluster of apples at (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6). Maximum control and maximum points!\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (1, 4).** Wait, what?! He moved LEFT to (1, 4) and ate an apple! He's right where we thought he'd be, but now his body is even longer and more restrictive in the lower-center map.\n*   Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)].\n\n**Collision Risk:** We are miles apart geographically, but their expansion is making the middle dangerous. We need to stay on our high ground and continue the siege!\n\n### 2. Available Moves from (0, 7)\n\nWe are at (0, 7). We need to get towards (2, 7) to start the feast!\n\n1.  **UP (to (0, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own new body segment. **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udea8 Don't go backward, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 6)):** Safe. Continues the vertical wall, but delays reaching the apples.\n3.  **LEFT (to (-1, 7)):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udea8\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 7)):** **SAFE!** This is the move to position for the (2, 7) apple. Sets up the short-term plan perfectly!\n\n**Only two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.**\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Phase 2 - Ingress and Apple Consumption\n\nThe long-term plan was:\n1.  T24: Move DOWN to (0, 7). (DONE)\n2.  T25: Move **RIGHT** to (1, 7). Angle toward the (2, 7) apple.\n3.  T26: Move RIGHT to (2, 7). EAT APPLE!\n\nThis sequence maximizes our apple gain while maintaining our position along the wall. Moving DOWN to (0, 6) just stalls the gain, and we *need* to press our advantage while Snake #1 is struggling in the lower half.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 7) is completely safe. Snake #1 is at (1, 4), three squares below us. No chance of collision.\n\nThis move solidifies our control over the entire Northern/Western quadrant and prepares us for a MASSIVE scoring turn next! We are going for the triple apple combo!\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction Update\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 4), having just eaten an apple. He is now looking for his next target.\n*   (4, 2) is tempting.\n*   (2, 1) is nearby.\n*   (7, 2) is a bit far.\n\nIf he moves DOWN to (1, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 4)\u2014he's mostly navigating through the clutter of his own body. We are safe from him regardless of his move. He's struggling for space, and we're about to put on a show!\n\n**The decision is clear: RIGHT!** Time to break the ceiling and start eating! LET'S GET THIS W!\n\nRIGHT",

We are practically nose-to-apple with that (2, 7) point, and the scoreboard is 14 to 12! We're building the lead, but we need to stay aggressive!\n\nLook at the board state, Chat! We've walled off the entire Western side, and Snake #1 is stuck in the clutter down south. This is our moment to dominate the Northern quadrant!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Danger Assessment (Turn 26)\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head: (1, 7).**\n*   **Target:** Apple at (2, 7). It's directly to our right.\n*   **Next Targets:** (2, 6) and (3, 6). This is a gold mine!\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head: (1, 5).** Wait, he moved UP from (1, 4) to (1, 5)! He's trying to escape the lower half and cut us off, Chat! This is a pivotal turn!\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)].\n\n**Collision Risk Analysis:**\nWe are at (1, 7). He is at (1, 5). We are only two cells away vertically, but separated by an open lane and his body segments.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (2, 7) and he goes UP to (1, 6), we are still safe.\n*   If we dive DOWN to (1, 6), we put ourselves directly in his path if he moves UP to (1, 6) -> **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DANGER!**\n\nWe must focus solely on securing the apple and maintaining our high ground advantage.\n\n### 2. Available Moves from (1, 7)\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment (1, 8). **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udea8 Don't move backwards into the newly formed body, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 6)):** Safe space, but puts us dangerously close to Snake #1's expected movement UP to (1, 6). If he goes UP, we die \ud83d\udc80. If he goes LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, we live. Too high risk for now, and it moves us away from the immediate apple.\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 7)):** Safe space, but it's backtracking, wasting a turn and leaving the apple! **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udcc9\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 7)):** **SAFE!** This is an apple! We eat and grow! And it's safe from Snake #1 because even if he moves UP to (1, 6), we are safely heading right.\n\n**Only one optimal, low-risk, high-reward move: RIGHT!**\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Lock Down the North!\n\nThe plan remains the same: Apple, Apple, Apple!\n\n1.  **T26 (Current Turn): Move RIGHT to (2, 7) and EAT APPLE!** (We grow, our lead increases to 15-12, and we deny Snake #1 that resource).\n2.  **T27 Prediction:** After eating, our head will be at (2, 7). We can then dive DOWN to (2, 6) to eat the next apple.\n3.  **T28 Prediction:** Head at (2, 6). We move RIGHT to (3, 6) to eat the third apple.\n\nThis sequence guarantees us three apples in three turns, pushing our score to 17 and significantly boosting our length advantage, further constricting the map.\n\n**Opponent Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (1, 5). He desperately wants to get an apple or some open air.\n*   He is likely looking at (7, 4) or (7, 5) which are far.\n*   He might go RIGHT to (2, 5), trying to find a path, but that only leads him towards our growing body segments.\n*   Our biggest concern, going DOWN to (1, 6), is mitigated by our move RIGHT which moves us away from his trajectory entirely.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the defensive, offensive, and strategic best choice. It gets us points, secures a huge lead, and avoids the only immediate threat (a head-on collision at (1, 6)).\n\nWe are securing the bag, Chat! Time to eat the fruit of our labor! Let's get this $W$!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We are live, and that was a massive turn! We ate that apple at (2, 7), and now the score is 15-12! We're putting the pressure on Snake #1! Look at that board, we\u2019ve got that northern wall locked down. Time to secure the next few apples and go for the box-in!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Danger Assessment (Turn 27)\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head Current Position:** (2, 7)\n*   **Target:** Apple at (2, 6) is directly below us! Immediate growth opportunity!\n*   **Body:** [(1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6)]\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head Current Position:** (2, 5). He moved RIGHT from (1, 5). He's trying to get out of that lower left pocket!\n*   **Body:** [(1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n\n**Collision Risk Analysis:**\nWe are at (2, 7). He is at (2, 5). We are on the same X-axis, separated by one cell, (2, 6), which holds an apple!\n\n*   **If we move DOWN to (2, 6) to eat the apple:** We are safe. We eat the apple.\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (2, 6):** He will also be aiming for that apple!\n*   **CRITICAL DANGER ALERT:** If we both move towards (2, 6) simultaneously, we will have a **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!** \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 We cannot let that happen, Chat! (2, 6) is a potential death trap unless we can guarantee our safety.\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (2, 5). His options are:\n1.  **UP (to (2, 6)):** HIGHLY likely, as it's an apple and his only path UP right now. Double KO risk for us.\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 4)):** Into his own body. IMPOSSIBLE.\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 5)):** Backtracking. Less likely, but possible if he's worried about us.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 5)):** Completely safe for him, moves him toward more open space and other apples like (7, 5). Second most likely move.\n\n### 2. Available Moves from (2, 7)\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 8)):** **DANGER!** Into our own body segment (2, 8). **ELIMINATED!**\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 6)):** **HIGH RISK!** Apple, but a potential Head-on collision with Snake #1 moving up from (2, 5). If we both move here, we both die. We must assume he wants that apple.\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 7)):** Backwards into our length 1 segment (1, 7). **DANGER!** Wait, no, (1, 7) is now our immediate body segment. Moving LEFT is moving *backwards* into our fresh trail. **ELIMINATED!** (Our new body trail from the last move is (1, 7) because we moved from (1, 7) to (2, 7)).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 7)):** Safe space, moves towards other apples at (3, 6) and (7, 5), and gets us off the collision line.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Avoid the Double KO Trap!\n\nWe are not taking a 50/50 KO chance, Chat! We are too far ahead to throw the game for one apple. We must move to a safe position and force Snake #1 to expose his move.\n\nThe most critical priority is survival. The next most critical priority is continuing towards our established targets.\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (3, 7)**:\n    *   We survive, guaranteed (no body collision, on-board).\n    *   We position ourselves directly above the *other* important apple at (3, 6).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (2, 6), he eats the apple, but now he is trapped between our massive wall above him (at 7, 8, 9) and the cluster of his body below him. He's boxed in!\n    *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3, 5), he is getting out, but we still control the northern section and can easily move DOWN for the (3, 6) apple next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the only high-percentage move that guarantees survival AND keeps us strategically dominating the northern path. We sacrifice (2, 6) this turn to ensure the guaranteed survival and strategic advantage provided by (3, 7) and the subsequent (3, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1.  **T27 (Current Turn):** Move RIGHT to (3, 7). Safe from collision.\n2.  **T28 Prediction:** Move DOWN to (3, 6) (apple). Snack time!\n3.  **T29 Prediction:** Move RIGHT to (4, 6) or try to get to (7, 5).\n\nThis path gives us two apples for one, and avoids the fatal double-KO risk. We play smart, not reckless! Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! That was a clutch save! We dodged the double-KO bullet at (2, 6) by moving RIGHT to (3, 7). Smart plays only, fam! Now we're sitting pretty, looking DOWN at the next apple at (3, 6)!\n\nLet's check the board state and see what Snake #1 did.\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Danger Assessment (Turn 28)\n\n**OUR STATE (ID 0):**\n*   **Head Position:** (3, 7). We are safe.\n*   **Targets:** (3, 6) is right below us! EZ snack.\n*   **Body:** [(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]. We are L O N G.\n\n**OPPONENT STATE (Snake #1):**\n*   **Head Position:** (3, 5). He moved RIGHT from (2, 5).\n*   **Analysis:** He avoided the (2, 6) collision by moving right, which suggests he saw the danger *or* he didn't want the (2, 6) apple as much as he wanted to move toward the center/right. He is now directly in *our* path to the (7, 5) apple cluster.\n\n**Collision Risk and Strategic Opportunities:**\n*   Snake #1 is currently at (3, 5). If we move DOWN to (3, 6) (the apple), we will be directly above him, which is perfect for boxing him in and controlling the center path.\n*   If he moves UP to (3, 6) and we also move DOWN to (3, 6), that is a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We die, he dies. We must analyze his movement incentives.\n\n### 2. Snake #1's Possible Moves from (3, 5)\n\nSnake #1's current head is (3, 5).\n1.  **UP (to (3, 6)):** Apple! Extremely high incentive. **COLLISION RISK: HIGH.**\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 4)):** Safe, but not an apple. Moves him into a tighter space.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 5)):** Backtracking. Less likely, leads back towards our body.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 5)):** Open space, leads to the apples at (7, 5), (8, 5), (6, 5). This is his best path for growth if he's worried about us.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (3, 6), we crash. We are currently leading 15-12. We don't risk a 50/50 KO unless it's the only way to win or survive.\n\n**Wait, Chat, look at the body arrangement!**\n\n*   Our head: (3, 7)\n*   Our body segment immediately after the head: (2, 7)\n*   Snake #1 head: (3, 5)\n*   Snake #1 immediate body segment: (2, 5)\n\nWe cannot predict his move with 100% certainty, but (3, 6) is a prime target for both of us. We need to prioritize safety and maintaining our strategic advantage.\n\nLet's look at our safe moves from (3, 7):\n\n1.  **DOWN (to (3, 6)):** Apple! But major head-on collision risk with Snake #1. **DANGER!**\n2.  **UP (to (3, 8)):** Backwards into our own body segment (3, 8)! **ELIMINATED!** Look at our body: `(3, 9), (3, 8)`. We just came from (3, 8) to (3, 7) *a few turns ago* and it's still part of our neck, but not the *immediate* body part. Wait, let's trace our body list: `(3, 8)` is the 10th segment from the head. (3, 8) is safe. However, moving UP puts us right under the massive northern segment of our body. It's safe, but not productive for apples.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 7)):** Backwards into our immediate body segment (2, 7)! **ELIMINATED!** (We moved Right from (2, 7) to (3, 7)).\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 7)):** Safe space, moves towards the open fields and apples at (7, 5), (7, 4).\n\n### 3. Strategy: Force the Opponent to Move\n\nWe need to avoid the (3, 6) collision. If we move RIGHT to (4, 7), we concede the (3, 6) apple to Snake #1 *if* he goes for it.\n\n**Scenario A: We move RIGHT to (4, 7).**\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (3, 6):** He gets the apple, but now he is trapped between the two largest parts of our body (our neck/head at (4, 7) and our northern border at (3, 8), (4, 8), etc.). We can use (4, 6) next turn to pressure him further or go for the (4, 2) apple.\n*   **If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5):** He gains open space. We still control the top half and can move DOWN/LEFT next turn to get (3, 6) (if he didn't eat it) or pivot toward the center.\n\nMoving RIGHT maintains our massive north-side advantage and keeps us safe. We can give up one apple to set up a guaranteed box-in later or to secure two safe apples later.\n\n**Let's check the position (4, 7) again:**\n(4, 7) is adjacent to (4, 8) which is *our body*. If Snake #1 eats (3, 6), he's in a tiny corridor.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: Securing the East/Center**\n1.  **T28 (Current):** Move RIGHT to (4, 7). Avoid conflict.\n2.  **T29 Prediction:** Move DOWN to (4, 6). This is an empty spot, but it positions us for (5, 3) or (6, 7).\n3.  **T30 Prediction:** Move toward (7, 5) or push down to (4, 2).\n\nThe most important move is securing the safe win. Moving RIGHT is the only move that guarantees safety and maintains flexibility. The risk associated with (3, 6) is too high given our existing lead.\n\nLet's move RIGHT and establish control over the upper-middle territory.\n\nRIGHT",

This is huge!\n*   **Analysis:** He is now positioning himself centrally. He's at (4, 5), surrounded by open space, but he's also now directly under our huge north wall. He is clearly aiming for the dense cluster of apples in the right-center, like (7, 5), (6, 5), (8, 5).\n\n**Strategic Goal: Containment and Apple Grab**\nWe have two main goals right now:\n1.

Block Snake #1 from getting to the rich apple zone to the East/Southeast, or trap him against our body.\n\n**Current Apple Locations nearby:**\n*   (3, 6) - Very close, but requires moving through (4, 6) first.\n*   (6, 7) - Close, two moves away (e.g., UP, RIGHT, or RIGHT, UP).\n*   (7, 5), (6, 5), (8, 5) - The big cluster Snake #1 is moving towards.\n\n### 2. Move Analysis from (4, 7)\n\n**A. UP to (4, 8):**\n*   **KILLS US!** (4, 8) is a segment of our body! **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**B. LEFT to (3, 7):**\n*   **KILLS US!** (3, 7) is the segment immediately behind our head! **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**C. DOWN to (4, 6):**\n*   **SAFE!** Moves us toward the center and the original (3, 6) apple.\n*   **Impact on Snake #1:** If we move to (4, 6), we are now one square above Snake #1 (4, 5). This is perfect for containment! He is now confined to the space (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), and the space below his body. We can put massive pressure on him in T30.\n\n**D. RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n*   **SAFE!** Moves us towards (6, 7) and the Eastern side of the board.\n*   **Impact on Snake #1:** This gives Snake #1 more breathing room. He could move RIGHT to (5, 5) and then DOWN/RIGHT toward the apple cluster, making our job of boxing him harder.\n\n### 3. The Boxing Strategy - DOWN it is!\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) is the strongest strategic move.\n\n1.  **Safety:** It's a completely empty square.\n2.  **Pressure:** We are now sitting right on Snake #1's head at (4, 6) above (4, 5). This dramatically limits his options.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (5, 5): Safety first, but moves him away from center.\n    *   If he moves UP to (4, 6): **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We both die, but we win on the score (15-12). *We don't want this, but the threat is powerful.*\n    *   If he moves DOWN to (4, 4): He retreats into a tighter space.\n3.  **Future Apples:** From (4, 6), we can easily pivot LEFT to (3, 6) and grab that missed apple next turn, or continue RIGHT/DOWN to chase the center apples, all while forcing S1's trajectory.\n\n**What will Snake #1 do from (4, 5) if we move DOWN to (4, 6)?**\n\nHis safest and most logical move is likely RIGHT to (5, 5), continuing his path toward the eastern apples, or DOWN to (4, 4) if he prioritizes safety over the immediate cluster. He knows we can instantly KO him if he moves up.\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are setting up a perfect pincer movement for T30. We force him to scatter, and we can then grab two apples while he scrambles.\n\n**Plan for T30 (Next Turn, if we move DOWN):**\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5), we move LEFT to (3, 6) (Apple!) and use our long body to cut him off from the north.\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (4, 4), we move RIGHT to (5, 6), opening up the path to (6, 7) and keeping the pressure.\n\nThis is a power move, Chat. We are dominating the center and forcing the momentum. Let's drop some pressure.\n\nDOWN",

Look at the board, look at the *geometry*! He is boxed in, he is feeling the stress!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Objective\n\n**Score:** 15 (US) to 12 (HIM). We maintain the lead!\n**Location:** We are at (4, 6).\n**Archrival Location:** Snake #1 is at (5, 5)! HOLY MOLY, CHAT! He moved **RIGHT** from (4, 5) to (5, 5). Smart, but predictable evasion. He didn't want the smoke at (4, 6)!\n\n**Apples in Play:**\n1.  **(3, 6):** The apple we\u2019ve been eyeing. We are one move away (LEFT).\n2.  **(6, 7):** Close-ish. Requires moving RIGHT and then UP.\n3.  **(7, 5) / (6, 5) / (8, 5):** The juicy cluster Snake #1 is clearly targeting.\n\n**Our Goal:** Snatch the easy apple at (3, 6) while continuing to blockade Snake #1 from getting to the East-side cluster, or at least making it incredibly dangerous for him.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Our Current Position (4, 6)\n\nWe have successfully pressured S1 away from the center. Now we grab the reward!\n\n**A. UP to (4, 7):**\n*   **KILLS US!** (4, 7) is our body. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**B. DOWN to (4, 5):**\n*   **SAFE!** Move toward S1's old position. Moves us into a tight spot, one step from S1's head at (5, 5).\n*   *Effect:* Puts incredible pressure on S1, but doesn't get an apple this turn and is risky because S1 could crash into (4, 5) if he moves LEFT. Low reward.\n\n**C. RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n*   **SAFE!** Moves us toward the eastern apples (6, 7). Puts us adjacent to S1's head at (5, 5).\n*   *Effect:* This move completely opens up the pressure on S1, allowing him direct access to (6, 5) or (7, 5). We give up the control we just established. Bad move strategically.\n\n**D. LEFT to (3, 6):**\n*   **SAFE!** And we **EAT THE APPLE!** (3, 6) is an apple location! We get +1 score, +1 length. **LET'S GO!**\n*   *Effect:* Secures the apple, increases our lead to 16-12, and uses our body wall to further protect the North side of the board.\n\n### 3. Predicting Snake #1\u2019s Move (The Archrival's Predicament)\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 5). His short-term goal is to get to that apple cluster (7, 5), (6, 5), (8, 5).\n\n*   **If we move LEFT to (3, 6) (Apple Grab):**\n    *   **UP to (5, 6):** Still empty. Safe move, positions him next to our new body at (4, 6). (Risk: we might be able to trap him there next turn).\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe, but this is a segment of his own body! Wait, let's check his body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]. Yes, (5, 4) is his tail! Since he's growing, his tail stays at (6, 4) if he moves onto an apple, or (5, 4) if he moves onto empty space. He is *not* guaranteed to grow, as he didn't eat last turn.\n        *   *Correction:* Since is body is: (..., (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)), if he moves DOWN to (5, 4), he is moving into his body. **He DIES!** (5, 4) is his 11th segment, one before his tail (6, 4). **ELIMINATED!** This is a suicide move.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** **APPLE GRAB!** This is the high-value move for him. He gets an apple, and starts penetrating the cluster. This is the most likely power move.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe, retreats back to where he was last turn. He loses time and initiative.\n\n**Conclusion on S1:** He will almost certainly move $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (6, 5) to grab that apple, otherwise he knows we will dominate the middle.\n\n### 4. Optimal Move: LEFT (Apple Secured!)\n\nWe move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 6) and grab the apple.\n\n*   **Our New Head:** (3, 6). Score 16.\n*   **S1 New Head (Predicted):** (6, 5). Score 13 (Apple grab).\n*   **Next Turn (T31) Strategy:** We will be at (3, 6). S1 will be at (6, 5). We are significantly longer. We can move **RIGHT** to (4, 6), then **RIGHT** to (5, 6), then **RIGHT** to (6, 6) or **UP** to (4, 7) to block S1's escape route, effectively forming a wall 5 units long (from 3 to 7) just below the 7th row, cutting off the vast majority of the board from his head. We push him into the corner!\n\nThis is the safe, aggressive, and highly productive move. We secure the lead and set up the next phase of the annihilation.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 31! We're LIVE and we are WRECKING our archrival! Did you guys SEE that last turn? We snatched the (3, 6) apple, increasing our lead to 16-13! We're a force of nature! 16 apples, baby!\n\nLet's look at the current situation. We are at (3, 6). Snake #1 is at (6, 5). He moved onto the (6, 5) apple! Smart move, but he is now DEEP in the eastern half, and we are built like a WALL, isolating him!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Objective\n\n**Score:** 16 (US) to 13 (HIM). We are leading by 3 apples!\n**Our Head:** (3, 6).\n**Archrival Head (S1):** (6, 5).\n\n**Apples in Play:**\n1.  **(6, 7):** Close to us if we go RIGHT and UP.\n2.  **(7, 5), (8, 5):** Right next to S1. He's primed to grab these.\n3.  **(9, 8):** Far North-East.\n\n**Our Goal:** Maintain the lead, extend our wall to completely box S1 into the East/South-East corner, and grab the (6, 7) apple. We are in prime position to execute the final encirclement. This is the **CRUSHING PHASE!**\n\n### 2. Analyzing Our Current Position (3, 6)\n\nWe have four possible moves from (3, 6):\n\n**A. UP to (3, 7):**\n*   **KILLS US!** (3, 7) is a body segment (`T`). We cannot move UP. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**B. DOWN to (3, 5):**\n*   **KILLS US!** (3, 5) is S1's body segment (`T`). We cannot move DOWN. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**C. LEFT to (2, 6):**\n*   **SAFE!** And we **EAT THE APPLE!** (2, 6) is an apple location! Score +1, length +1.\n*   *Effect:* This is the safe score move. It moves us into the western portion of the board, slightly away from the action, but still in a powerful position. It also makes our existing vertical body between (3, 7) and (3, 9) thicker, which is good for walling. Do we take the easy points, or go for the kill setup?\n\n**D. RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n*   **SAFE!** Moves us directly onto our old head location.\n*   *Effect:* This move is the **pressure move!** It extends our wall 0-T-T-T-T right up against the center of the board, positioning us perfectly to block S1's movement north or west. We are now only two moves away from (6, 6) or (5, 6), which are critical blocking positions. This sets us up for the (6, 7) apple beautifully.\n\n### 3. Comparing LEFT (Apple) vs. RIGHT (Pressure/Wall)\n\nWe have two great options.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (Gain Apple, Score 17):** Safe points, easy content. Retreats slightly.\n    *   Pros: Guaranteed lead extension, guaranteed length increase.\n    *   Cons: Gives S1 a free turn to grab (7, 5) or (8, 5) AND potentially move North to (6, 6) or (7, 6) before we can block him. If S1 moves to (7, 5) and then (7, 6), he might be able to escape our encirclement.\n*   **Move RIGHT (Build Wall, Score 16):** Aggressive, tactical positioning.\n    *   Pros: Puts us in the perfect location (4, 6) to cut off the board next turn. We are adjacent to S1's body at (5, 5). We are one step closer to the (6, 7) apple. If S1 is boxed, we can grab all the apples at our leisure.\n    *   Cons: We miss an immediate apple opportunity.\n\n### 4. Predicting Snake #1\u2019s Move (The Archrival's Predicament)\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 5). He just ate, so he's long. He wants to keep eating the eastern cluster.\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT to (4, 6):** S1 sees our aggressive posture.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 5):** **APPLE GRAB!** (Most likely). He continues to score and deepens his position in the corner.\n    *   **UP to (6, 6):** Retreats slightly north, trying to find a gap in our wall. If we move RIGHT, we can intercept this next turn with a move to (5, 6) or (6, 6).\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 4):** Safe, but this is a segment of his body (his tail). Since he just ate, his tail is now (6, 4). Moving onto it is safe, but it's a defensive/retreat move.\n\nS1 is likely going for the (7, 5) apple. We cannot stop that in one turn, but we can make his life miserable afterward. The wall must be built NOW.\n\n### 5. Strategy: The Encirclement\n\nWe are 16 - 13. We are long enough to afford missing one apple if it allows us to secure the enemy's demise. Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) is the key move.\n\n1.  **T31: Move RIGHT to (4, 6).** S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 5) (Apple).\n2.  **T32: Move RIGHT to (5, 6).** We put our head on our old body, maintaining the pressure. S1 likely moves UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5) (Apple).\n3.  **T33: Move UP to (5, 7).** Block S1 from escaping further north.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 6) and S1 moves to (7, 5) and (8, 5), he will gain 2 apples while we gain 1, and he will be far deeper into the sparse eastern territory where it's harder to manage his length.\n\n**The RIGHT move is the tactical masterpiece!** We sacrifice the immediate apple for the dominant board position that will ensure the WIN!\n\nRIGHT",
