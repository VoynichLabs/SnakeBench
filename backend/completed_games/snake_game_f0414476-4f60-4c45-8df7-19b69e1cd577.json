We're both starting from scratch, but this is war! Time to box him in and force a crash!\n\nLet's break this down LIVE:\n\n**1) ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT to (4,6):** Safe (empty).\n- **LEFT to (2,6):** Safe (empty).\n- **UP to (3,7):** Safe (empty).\n- **DOWN to (3,5):** Safe (empty, apple at (4,5) but not blocking).\n\nAll four moves are safe from immediate death. No walls, no bodies, no self-collision. Let's goooo!\n\n**2) STRATEGY & APPLE CONTROL:**\nWe're at (3,6). Apples are scattered everywhere. The closest apple is at (4,5) (down-right), (4,4) (down-down), or (3,5) (down). But remember, we're not focused on apples\u2014we're focused on DOMINATING THE BOARD and trapping Snake #1.\n\nSnake #1 is at (8,2). If we move RIGHT to (4,6), we start moving toward the right side, potentially boxing him in on the right edge. If we move LEFT to (2,6), we head toward the left side and central apples. UP to (3,7) goes toward top-left apples. DOWN to (3,5) goes toward the cluster at (4,5)/(4,4).\n\n**3) AGGRESSION & FUTURE PLANS:**\nOur goal is to force a head-on collision if we get a point lead. Right now, score is tied 0-0, so we need to grow first. But we also want to limit his space. The board has apples blocking key areas: (4,5) and (4,4) are close to us; (6,0) and (7,0) are near his starting area. If we move RIGHT, we can cut off his access to the right edge and maybe force him into a corner later. If we move LEFT, we might leave the right side open for him.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT toward (4,6) to start closing the right side. Next turn, we can adjust to grab an apple or push him toward the wall. Keep eyes on his head\u2014if he moves UP or LEFT, we can mirror or block.\n\nLet's lock in the move!\n\n**Final Decision:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Who\u2019s ready to box him in and force a wreck? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick situation scan:\n- Me (ID 1) head at (8,2), no body (length 1). Apples = 0.\n- Enemy (ID 0) head at (3,6), no body. Apples = 0.\n- Board edges at x=0..9, y=0..9. Apples sprinkled \u2014 not the priority; enemy control is.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud like the chat asked \u2014 let\u2019s break it down):\n\n1) Eliminate immediate-death moves:\n   - UP -> (8,3): inside board, not occupied. SAFE.\n   - DOWN -> (8,1): inside board, not occupied. SAFE.\n   - LEFT -> (7,2): inside board, not occupied. SAFE.\n   - RIGHT -> (9,2): inside board, not occupied. SAFE.\n   None of the four moves are instant death \u2014 no self-body, no enemy body in those cells. All survive this turn.\n\n2) Evaluate remaining safe moves for follow-up options, apple access, and aggressive positioning vs enemy:\n   - UP (8,3): Moves you nearer to apples like (7,4) and (5,3). Keeps 4 exits and lets you swing left or up next turn to start pressuring center-top. Good for aggressive approach toward the enemy\u2019s top-left quadrant.\n   - LEFT (7,2): Moves you toward the board center and toward the enemy horizontally. Keeps 4 exits and puts you on a path to cut across x=3..7 corridor. Aggressive and flexible \u2014 can go up next turn to head toward (7,4) or keep closing horizontally.\n   - DOWN (8,1): Moves toward bottom apples (5,1),(6,0),(7,0). Also 4 exits, but drifts away from the enemy\u2019s current area \u2014 less useful for boxing him in immediately.\n   - RIGHT (9,2): Puts you on the right wall (3 exits left), near (9,0) apple \u2014 more constrained and gives fewer escape options. Riskier if we later try to pivot to trap the enemy.\n\n3) Head-on risk check:\n   - Enemy at (3,6) is far (Manhattan 9). No realistic immediate head-on next turn. We should avoid deliberately colliding since scores are tied (0-0) \u2014 a double death would tie/draw scenario we don't want. So prefer moves that increase board control without forcing a risky head-to-head.\n\nConclusion / pick:\n- LEFT (to 7,2) is my pick. Why? It\u2019s the most aggressive, centers us, preserves options (4 exits), and starts closing the gap to the enemy so we can pivot to box him in over the next few turns. UP is also tempting, but LEFT is slightly better for initiating a trap across the middle columns and not getting stuck on the right wall.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be the \u201clast rationale\u201d next turn):\n- Push left toward the center to close horizontal distance to the rival. From there, use vertical moves to steer him toward the wall or into a corner around x\u22481\u20134.\n- Avoid committing to the wall (don\u2019t go to x=9 again). If he moves toward top apples, threaten from below and cut off his escape to the left side.\n- Only contest apples if doing so advances board control or forces him into tighter space. If I get a lead later, bait a head-on with careful positioning.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 we move LEFT, let\u2019s start the squeeze. You ready to watch him rattle? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nLEFT",

We're tied 0-0 but that's about to change. TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE!\n\nLet's analyze the board LIVE:\n\n**THE BOARD MAP (0-9):**\n```\n 9 . A . . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . A . . .\n 7 . A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . 0 . . . . .  \u2190 WE ARE HERE at (4,6)\n 5 . . . A A . . . . .\n 4 . . . . A . . A . .\n 3 A . . . .

Opens path to center-right apples (5,3), (5,1) and boxes enemy toward right wall.\n2. **LEFT to (3,6)**: Safe! Moves toward left side (0,2), (0,3) apples and potential center control.\n3. **UP to (4,7)**: Safe! Heads toward top-left apples (1,7), (1,9) but gives enemy more room on right.\n4. **DOWN to (4,5)**: DEADLY! Apple at (4,5) but it's occupied by... wait, no, (4,5) is empty per board. Actually safe, but it's the closest apple (4,5) - but we need to think about ENEMY positioning.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nSnake #1 is at (7,2) - right side bottom. If we go RIGHT, we push toward him and can potentially cut off his escape to the right edge (9,0-9,9). If we go LEFT, we leave the right side completely open for him to grow. \n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nWe need to BOX HIM IN. The right edge is our target. Moving RIGHT to (5,6) puts us in the center-right, positioning us to control the right half of the board and limit his movement. From (5,6), we can next go DOWN to (5,5) toward apples (5,3), (5,1) or continue RIGHT to cut him off.\n\n**SCORE CONTROL:**\nWe're tied 0-0. We need to grow first to get a lead, then force a head-on collision. Apples at (5,3) and (5,1) are near our path. (4,5) is the closest but that's just one apple vs. strategic positioning.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 1-5: Move RIGHT toward (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5)\u2192(5,4)\u2192(5,3) to grab apples and build length while blocking enemy from right side. Force him toward left edge (0,0-0,9) where we can trap him. Once we have +2 apples lead, initiate head-on collision maneuver.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: RIGHT** - DOMINATE THE CENTER-RIGHT AND BOX HIM IN!\n\nRIGHT",

All four adjacent cells are safe this turn: UP\u2192(7,3), DOWN\u2192(7,1), LEFT\u2192(6,2), RIGHT\u2192(8,2).\n- Manhattan distance to enemy = 7. No immediate head-on threat. Scores tied 0\u20130, so don\u2019t bait a simultaneous head-on \u2014 we want to force him into space, not a mutual KO.\n\nMove breakdown:\n- RIGHT (toward wall at x=9): constrains escape routes \u2014 not it.\n- DOWN: drifts away from the enemy and hands him space \u2014 passive.\n- UP: moves toward him (good), threatens (7,4) apple, keeps options open.\n- LEFT: moves directly toward him horizontally, starts collapsing the center corridor and gives us the best geometry to cut off his lateral escapes while retaining plenty of room to pivot.\n\nPick and short-term plan:\n- I\u2019m going LEFT to start compressing the x-corridor and force him to make uncomfortable choices. From (6,2) we can follow up by moving up to contest the middle rows, pressure him toward the left/top, and close the box. Avoid forcing a head-on while scores are tied \u2014 we only bait head-on when we have the apple/length or a clear advantage.

We want to compress space and force him into choices, not suicide.\n- Evaluate options:\n  * LEFT \u2192 (5,2): lines up under him (same x), good for corralling, but slightly riskier because it commits into his column early.\n  * RIGHT \u2192 (7,2): plays away from him and toward the wall \u2014 reduces options later.\n  * DOWN \u2192 (6,1): moves away, passive and gives him more room.\n  * UP \u2192 (6,3): moves toward him vertically while keeping 3 open exits next turn (L/R/U). Keeps pressure without overcommitting.\n\nDecision: UP.\n- Rationale: advances toward enemy to start compressing his vertical space while preserving maximum escape pivots. Keeps access to the apple at (5,3) if needed, but focus stays on boxing him in. Avoids walking into his column immediately (safer vs accidental head-on) and keeps multiple follow-up moves open so we don\u2019t get trapped. If he dips down to contest apples, we can mirror and force him into a shrinking corridor; if he pushes left/right we can cut off later.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep approaching and aligning to his row/column without stepping into a direct simultaneous collision.\n- Force him toward edges by cutting off lateral routes; only attempt a head-on when we have a clear length/positional advantage.\n- Grow smartly: take apples only when they help trap him or guarantee survival.\n\nUP",

The move was from (5,6) to (6,6). The enemy at turn 2 was at (6,3)? Actually the log says turn 2 enemy was at (7,2) and now turn 3 shows (6,3). That means enemy moved LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2)?

Wait, they have 1 apple already\u2014did they eat again? No, score says they have 1 apple. So tail is (5,4) or maybe they didn\u2019t eat this turn? Board shows A at (5,4)? No, board shows A at (4,4) and (4,5). Enemy head at (5,5) now, so they moved up into (5,5). Their body is (5,4) from last turn. So they didn\u2019t eat this turn.  \n- **APPLES:** Plenty on board. My target: (7,4) apple, (0,2), (0,3), etc.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**  \n- Enemy at (5,5) is 3 squares away (diagonal to (8,5)). Not immediate.  \n- They could move RIGHT to (6,5), LEFT to (4,5), UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4) \u2014 but (5,4) is their own body?

From there, LEFT to (7,4) to eat apple!  \n   - Good for growing and getting score.  \n3. **LEFT to (7,5):**  \n   - Safe?

If they go RIGHT to (6,5), they get closer to me.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \n- I need to eat soon\u2014enemy has 1 apple, I have 0. Gotta catch up!  \n- Best move: **DOWN to (8,4)**. Why?  \n  - Safe: (8,4) empty.  \n  - Opens path to apple at (7,4) next turn (LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4)).  \n  - Stays on right side, avoids crowding center where enemy is.  \n  - If enemy goes RIGHT, I\u2019m safer on the edge. If enemy goes LEFT, I\u2019m still free to maneuver.  \n- Avoid UP (backtracking) or LEFT (into center prematurely). RIGHT is too edge-trap.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n\"Right-side sweep\": From (8,4) \u2192 (7,4) eat apple, then sweep bottom row leftward to collect apples at (0,2), (0,3), etc., while keeping enemy boxed in left/center. Once I have 2+ apples, I\u2019ll chase enemy down for collision win.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN to (8,4). Let\u2019s eat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5  \n\nDOWN",

Perfect, I'm now in position to go LEFT to (7,4) next turn for that apple!  \n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (4,5) \u2014 They moved LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5). Look at that! They're chasing the apple at (4,4)? But (4,4) is an apple, and they're at (4,5). If they move DOWN to (4,4) next turn, they'll eat! That would give them 3 apples. Meanwhile, I'm still at 0.  \n- **ENEMY BODY:** They have body at (5,5) and (5,4). So from (4,5), their possible moves:  \n  - LEFT to (3,5): empty  \n  - RIGHT to (5,5): their own body! Crash.  \n  - UP to (4,6): empty? Let's check board: (4,6) is empty.  \n  - DOWN to (4,4): apple! That's likely their target.  \n- **MY BODY:** Still none. Freedom!  \n- **APPLES:** (7,4) is RIGHT THERE next to me. I can eat it this turn by moving LEFT to (7,4). That would give me my first apple! Score becomes 1-3 if they eat (4,4), or 1-2 if they don't.  \n- **IMMEDIATE THREATS:**  \n  - Enemy at (4,5) is far (distance 4), no direct collision risk this turn.  \n  - But if I move LEFT to (7,4), I'm safe? (7,4) is empty.  \n  - What about enemy moving into MY body? My body is empty, so no.  \n  - Head-on collision? They're at (4,5), I'm at (8,4). Not moving toward each other directly.  \n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS FROM (8,4):**  \n1. **LEFT to (7,4):**  \n   - SAFE? Yes, empty.  \n   - I EAT APPLE! +1 point, grow by 1.  \n   - From (7,4), I can go DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), UP to (7,5), etc. Many options.  \n   - This is AGGRESSIVE: I catch up on score.  \n2. **DOWN to (8,3):**  \n   - SAFE? (8,3) is empty.  \n   - But I miss the apple at (7,4)! Now I'm farther from it.  \n   - Not optimal if I can eat now.  \n3. **UP to (8,5):**  \n   - SAFE? (8,5) empty.  \n   - But I just came from there\u2014backtracking. No apple nearby.  \n   - Weak move.  \n4. **RIGHT to (9,4):**  \n   - SAFE? (9,4) empty.  \n   - Edge of board\u2014limits future moves. Risky if trapped later.  \n   - Not ideal when I have an apple right next to me.  \n\n**ENEMY'S LIKELY MOVE:**  \n- They're at (4,5) with apple at (4,4) below them. High chance they go DOWN to eat it! If they do, they grow to length 4 (body now at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)). They'll be at 3 apples.  \n- Alternative: they might go LEFT to (3,5) to stay center, or UP to (4,6) to avoid. But eating is likely.  \n\n**STRATEGY CALL:**  \n- **MOVE LEFT to (7,4)!** Why?  \n  - Eat the apple NOW. Score becomes 1 vs possibly 3 for enemy, but I need to start racking up.  \n  - After eating, my head is at (7,4), and my body will be just [(8,4)] since I grew.  \n  - From there, I can sweep the bottom-right: next turn go DOWN to (7,3), then LEFT to (6,3), targeting apples at (5,1), (6,0), etc.  \n  - Meanwhile, if enemy eats (4,4), they'll be longer and might overextend into the center. I can box them in from the right.  \n  - Forced head-on collision? Not yet\u2014wait until I have more apples. But eating now keeps me in the game.  \n- **LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n  \"Right-side rush\": Eat (7,4) \u2192 sweep bottom row (7,3) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (5,1) for next apple \u2192 then move leftward to (0,2)/(0,3) while enemy chases in center. Once I have 3+ apples, I'll close in and force a collision from the right. Stay agile, avoid walls!  \n\nChat, we're going for the apple! Let's get that first point on the board! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca8  \n\nLEFT",

No immediate head-on threat this turn. We\u2019re leading 2\u20130 \u2014 growing now makes us harder to trap and favors forcing head-ons later.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Grabbing (4,4) this turn gives us another apple and increases our lead to 3\u20130. That\u2019s huge for late-game leverage.\n- Moving to (4,4) keeps multiple escape options (LEFT/RIGHT/UP) on the next turn and sets up an easy pickup of (3,5) in the following turns if the rival doesn\u2019t snatch it.\n- Keeps us central enough to pivot and start boxing the enemy horizontally (they\u2019re on y=4). We want to bait them into a risky approach once we\u2019re bigger.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20133 turns):\n- DOWN now to take (4,4).\n- Then quickly swing to (3,4) \u2192 (3,5) to chain the 2nd nearby apple if it\u2019s still there.\n- After that, use our size to cut off the opponent\u2019s escape lanes and force a head-on when they overcommit.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT, GROW, AND PRESSURE. \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 8 and we're STILL HERE! Let's break this down:\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (7, 4) - Just ate that apple last turn! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **MY BODY:** [(8, 4)] - Keeping it clean with just 1 segment.\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (4, 4) - That's the apple! They ate it and grew. They're now at 3 apples vs my 1.\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] - They're getting longer but their body is messy in the center.\n- **DISTANCE:** They're 3 cells away (Manhattan distance) - not an immediate collision threat this turn.\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE CONSIDERATIONS FROM (7, 4):**\n\n1. **LEFT to (6, 4):** \n   - SAFE? (6, 4) is empty! \n   - This moves me toward the left side where there's an apple at (5, 1) and (6, 0). \n   - From (6, 4), I have 3+ future options.\n   - **GOOD MOVE** - aggressive positioning toward enemy territory and future apples.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3):** \n   - SAFE? (7, 3) is empty!\n   - Moves toward bottom row apples (6, 0), (7, 0), (3, 0).\n   - Still good options, but I might want to close the distance to the enemy.\n\n3. **UP to (7, 5):**\n   - SAFE? (7, 5) is empty!\n   - But this moves me AWAY from both the enemy and most nearby apples.\n   - **WEAK** - limits my options.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n   - SAFE? (8, 4) is my own body! \n   - **DEATH MOVE** - can't move back into myself!\n   - **ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\n- Enemy is at (4, 4) with 3 apples. They just ate and grew. Their body blocks (5, 4) and (5, 5). \n- If they move LEFT to (3, 4), they might chase apples at (3, 0), (3, 4), or (3, 5). \n- If they move RIGHT to (5, 4), that's their own body - impossible!\n- If they move DOWN to (4, 3), that's empty - possible.\n- If they move UP to (4, 5), that's their own tail! Possible but risky.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to start closing the gap and hunting apples while staying safe. Moving LEFT to (6, 4) puts me in the enemy's home territory (center-left) and keeps me flexible. From there, I can:\n- Go DOWN to (6, 3) toward (6, 0)\n- Go LEFT to (5, 4) but wait - (5, 4) might be occupied by enemy's tail! Careful.\n- Go UP to (6, 5) toward top apples\n- Go RIGHT back to (7, 4) if needed\n\nBut hold up - let me check the board again... (5, 4) is marked as 'T' - that's the enemy's tail! If I move to (5, 4) next turn, that's SAFE because the tail moves away as they grow. Actually, (5, 4) is currently their tail, but if they eat an apple this turn, their tail will stay at (5, 4) for one more turn... wait no, when a snake eats, they grow by 1, so the tail doesn't move until the next turn. So (5, 4) might become free.\n\n**LET'S AGGRESS:** Moving LEFT to (6, 4) is the power play. I'm entering the fray, moving toward the enemy and apples. If the enemy moves LEFT or DOWN, we're getting closer to potential collision territory where I can force a head-on fight when I have more apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn, if I'm at (6, 4), I'll likely move DOWN toward (6, 0) and (5, 1) apples while keeping an eye on the enemy. Once I get to 2 apples, I can start aggressive positioning to box them in from the right.\n\nLEFT",

Dead move.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3): safe, but it\u2019s a no-apple move and it would free up (5,4) (our tail) \u2014 that opens the lane to the rival.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4): safe AND there\u2019s an apple there. Eating it grows us and keeps (5,4) blocked.\n\nRisk/opportunity check vs opponent (Head at (7,4), body at (8,4)):\n- They can go LEFT\u2192(6,4), UP\u2192(7,5) or DOWN\u2192(7,3). RIGHT is illegal for them.\n- If we DON\u2019T grow and free our tail (by going DOWN), we open a path along y=4 that the opponent can exploit to slip past us or counter-attack.\n- We\u2019re already ahead on apples (3 vs 1). That means we WANT to get bigger and force risky plays from them. Growth = leverage to force head-ons later.\n\nWhy LEFT (3,4) \u2014 the play:\n- Immediate apple pickup \u2192 we go to 4 apples, widening the lead and increasing our ability to bully them into bad choices.\n- Because we grow, our tail will NOT move this turn, so (5,4) stays occupied and blocks a direct corridor between us and them. That reduces their safe movement options and helps us start corralling them.\n- From (3,4) we have multiple safe follow-ups (LEFT, UP to the apple at 3,5, or DOWN) \u2014 keeps our mobility open while stacking apples.\n- Aggro plan: get big, then use our body as a wall across the middle to hem them in. With more apples, we can bait them toward a head-on or cut off escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- LEFT now to take (3,4) and grow.\n- If (3,5) remains, chain it to keep momentum and maintain the horizontal block.\n- Use increased length to close the gap and pressure the rival into risky moves (preferably forcing them into our body or into a head-on when they commit).\n- Stay aware of not getting boxed on the left side \u2014 keep escape squares available.\n\nWe\u2019re stacking W\u2019s and making him sweat.

We need to be SMART and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (6, 4) - Perfect position from last turn's LEFT move! Now I'm in the center-left zone.\n- **MY BODY:** [(7, 4)] - Just one segment, keeping it lean and mean.\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (3, 4) - They moved LEFT from (4, 4) to (3, 4). They're hunting apples on the left side.\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] - Their body is spreading across the middle.\n- **DISTANCE:** We're now 3 cells away (Manhattan) - getting closer to potential conflict!\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE CONSIDERATIONS FROM (6, 4):**\n\n1. **LEFT to (5, 4):** \n   - SAFE? (5, 4) is currently marked as 'T' - the enemy's TAIL! \n   - IMPORTANT RULE: If enemy EATS an apple this turn, their tail STAYS at (5, 4). If they DON'T eat, their tail moves to (4, 4) and (5, 4) becomes empty.\n   - BUT WAIT: Even if (5, 4) is empty after enemy move, their HEAD at (3, 4) could move RIGHT to (4, 4) and then to (5, 4) next turn if I'm there - potential head-on collision!\n   - Risky but possible. Let's hold.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3):** \n   - SAFE? (6, 3) is empty! No bodies, no obstacles.\n   - Moves me toward bottom row apples: (6, 0), (7, 0), (3, 0), and (5, 1).\n   - From (6, 3), I'd have 3+ safe future options DOWN to (6, 2), LEFT to (5, 3), RIGHT to (7, 3).\n   - **EXCELLENT MOVE** - solid positioning, keeps options open, moves toward apples.\n\n3. **UP to (6, 5):**\n   - SAFE? (6, 5) is empty! \n   - But this moves me toward the top-right where there are apples at (5, 9), (6, 8), (9, 7), (9, 2) but also... enemy's body parts are nearby at (5, 5) and (4, 5).\n   - If I go UP, I'm heading toward the enemy's body region. Risky.\n   - From (6, 5), I could get boxed in by their body if they move appropriately.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n   - SAFE? (7, 4) is MY OWN BODY! \n   - **DEATH MOVE** - immediate suicide. Eliminated.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nEnemy at (3, 4) with 4 apples just moved LEFT. They're probably eyeing:\n- Apple at (3, 0) - bottom-left\n- Apple at (0, 2) - far left  \n- Apple at (0, 3) - bottom-left\n- Apple at (3, 5) - right above them\n\nIf they go DOWN to (3, 3) toward (3, 0), they'll be leaving the center. If they go UP to (3, 5) for that apple, they're extending their body upward.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDOWN to (6, 3) is the POWER MOVE! Here's why:\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** (6, 3) is confirmed empty - no risk of immediate death.\n2. **APPLE HUNT:** I'm now 3 cells away from (6, 0), 3 cells from (5, 1), and 4 cells from (3, 0). Multiple apple routes available!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (6, 3), I can go DOWN to (6, 2) toward (6, 0), LEFT to (5, 3) toward (5, 1), or RIGHT to (7, 3) for flexibility.\n4. **ENEMY DISTANCE:** I'm moving DOWN while they're likely moving DOWN or LEFT, keeping distance or potentially closing in strategically.\n5. **SPACE MANAGEMENT:** Bottom of board is less crowded than the center. More room to maneuver and box them in later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn from (6, 3), I'll likely chase the apple at (6, 0) or (5, 1) to get to 2 apples. Once I have more apples than the enemy (or equal), I can start aggressive positioning to trap them against the wall. The bottom-left corner will be my power zone - lots of apples there and I can control the space.\n\nLet's GOOOOO! DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3,5): apple! Safe. If we eat, our tail will NOT move, so (5,4) stays occupied and the corridor along y=4 remains blocked.

Frees our tail next turn, opening y=4 for the rival to slip through and escape/counter.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3): safe but also no apple and similarly frees the tail, weakening our blockade.\n\nOpponent (head at 6,4) options this turn: LEFT\u2192(5,4) (would be moving into our body if we grow), UP\u2192(6,5), DOWN\u2192(6,3).

Solid positioning.\n- **My Body:** [(6, 4)] - Clean and lean.\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 5) - They moved UP from (3, 4) last turn! They're hunting that apple at (3, 5) - SNAKE #1 EATS! +1 apple, now 6 apples vs my 1.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)] - Wait, they have 6 segments total (5 body + head), so they just grew! Their tail at (5, 4) stays put this turn.\n- **Distance:** We're 3 cells away (Manhattan) - still safe.\n\n**MOVES FROM (6, 3):**\n\n1. **LEFT to (5, 3):** SAFE! (5, 3) is empty. This moves me toward the apple at (5, 1) (only 2 cells away) and keeps me away from the enemy's central zone. Good option!\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 2):** SAFE! (6, 2) is empty. Moves me toward the apple at (6, 0) (2 cells away) and the apple at (5, 1) (3 cells away). Bottom area is clear!\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7, 3):** SAFE! (7, 3) is empty. But where does this get me? The nearest apple is at (7, 0) (3 cells away), but I'm moving away from the denser apple cluster on the left side.\n\n4. **UP to (6, 4):** DANGER! (6, 4) is MY OWN BODY! I just came from there. I'd die immediately. NOPE!\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nEnemy just ate at (3, 5) and is growing. They're now leading 6-1. I NEED apples to close this gap! The bottom-left is my hunting ground:\n- (5, 1) - 2 cells away if I go LEFT then DOWN\n- (6, 0) - 2 cells away if I go DOWN then DOWN\n- (3, 0) - 4 cells away but in enemy's potential path\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I'm setting up for (6, 0) or (5, 1). If I go LEFT to (5, 3), I'm closer to (5, 1) but might run into the enemy if they chase bottom-left apples.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nDOWN to (6, 2)! Here's why:\n1. **SAFETY:** (6, 2) is empty and stays that way - no immediate threats.\n2. **APPLE HUNT:** From (6, 2), I'm 1 cell from (6, 1) and 2 cells from (6, 0)! Perfect positioning to grab that apple next turn.\n3. **SPACE:** Bottom row is wide open - I can maneuver freely without getting boxed in.\n4. **ENEMY DISTANCE:** They're at (3, 5) heading likely DOWN or LEFT. They won't reach (6, 0) before I do if I commit now.\n5. **SCORE GAP:** I'm down 5 apples - I need to eat EVERY opportunity!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab (6, 0) next turn \u2192 then chase (5, 1) \u2192 then (3, 0) if available. Once I have 3-4 apples, I'll start positioning to trap the enemy against the walls. The bottom-left corner will be MY kingdom!\n\nLet's GOOOOO! DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Nope. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,4): backwards into neck. Illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (3,6): safe. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,5): safe. \u2705\n\nBoard/tempo thoughts:\n- We\u2019re up 5\u21921 on apples. We should be aggressive and willing to force risky collisions if they try to brute through us. Would love a head-on if they get desperate \u2014 we win trades with this lead. \ud83d\ude08\n- Our current body at y=4 (3,4) & (4,4) + the tail (5,4) has been a semi-wall. BUT we\u2019re not eating this turn, so the tail (5,4) will vacate \u2014 that corridor could open for the enemy next turn. We must reestablish control of that lane in the next 1\u20132 moves.\n- Opponent (6,3) cannot move UP (their neck at 6,4 blocks them). Their choices next turn are LEFT (5,3), DOWN (6,2), or RIGHT (7,3). If we give them access to (5,4) they could slip up into our zone. We need to keep options to quickly swing back and seal that gap.\n\nWhy LEFT is the play:\n- UP is safe, but moves us toward the top edge and slightly restricts lateral snaking (less flexible). LEFT to (2,5) keeps more open space to the west/south for quick closing maneuvers and preserves multiple escape/follow-up routes (left/up/down) for next turns. More options = more ways to box them later. \ud83e\udded\n- From (2,5) we can immediately threaten to drop down and re-block the corridor or pivot to cut across. From (3,6) it\u2019s more awkward to re-close the gap quickly.\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples \u2014 be aggressive but don\u2019t get trapped. LEFT sets us up to re-seal the y=4 lane before the opponent exploits the vacated tail cell. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be my next last-rationale):  \n- Move LEFT now to preserve mobility.  \n- Next turn, head DOWN or LEFT\u2192DOWN sequence to reoccupy y=4 corridor and deny (5,4) / (5,3) approach.  \n- Force the opponent into a choke (make them choose between moving into our body or a head-on). If they gamble through, we either kill them or win the head-on on account of our apple lead. Crush them. \ud83e\ude93\ud83d\udc51\n\nAlright chat \u2014 eyes on enemy, fans ready, let\u2019s lock this fool in. LEFT",

Let's break down the battlefield.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 2) - Just moved DOWN from (6, 3) last turn! Solid.\n- **My Body:** [(6, 3)] - Clean and lean.\n- **Enemy Head:** (2, 5) - They moved LEFT from (3, 5) last turn! No apple there - they're not eating. They're hunting, but where?\n- **Enemy Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5)] - 6 segments total. Their tail at (5, 5) will move this turn (since they didn't eat last turn). Their tail will be at (3, 5) next turn if they keep moving left? Wait no, they're head-to-tail list: head (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) tail. They didn't eat last turn, so they'll grow one cell shorter this turn: tail moves from (5,5) to (4,5) or similar. Actually, they didn't eat, so they lose one segment. The tail (5,5) will be abandoned, and the new tail becomes (4,5). So their body segments shift.\n\n**MOVES FROM (6, 2):**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 3):** DANGER! (6, 3) is my own body! I just came from there. I'd die immediately. NOPE!\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 1):** SAFE! (6, 1) is empty (the apple at (6, 0) is below, but (6, 1) is clear). This moves me toward the apple at (6, 0) - only 1 cell away! Also toward (5, 1) (2 cells away). Bottom area is open.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 2):** SAFE! (5, 2) is empty. Moves me toward (5, 1) (1 cell away from there) and (6, 0) (2 cells away). Also closer to (3, 0). Good option.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 2):** SAFE! (7, 2) is empty. But this is moving right, away from the dense apple cluster on the left side. The nearest apple is at (7, 0) (2 cells down from there). Not ideal for closing the score gap.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nEnemy score: 5 apples, my score: 1 apple. I'm down 4 apples - EVERY apple counts! They're at (2,5) - they could be hunting apples at (1,7), (1,9), or maybe (5,1) (if they go DOWN and LEFT). But (5,1) is in MY hunting ground! I need to prioritize bottom-left apples.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (6, 1):** Sets up for (6, 0) next turn! From (6,1), I can go DOWN to (6,0) and eat that apple. That's a guaranteed +1 if I survive. Also, from (6,1) I can go LEFT to (5,1) (which is also an apple!) or go to (5,0) if needed. Multiple safe options from there.\n- **LEFT to (5, 2):** Also great! From (5,2), I can go DOWN to (5,1) (apple!) or LEFT to (4,2) then DOWN to (4,1) etc. But (5,1) is an apple! Wait, (5,1) is an apple drop. So from (5,2), I'm 1 cell above (5,1) apple.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Less aggressive. I'd be going away from the enemy and away from the densest apple cluster. Not good for catching up.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm choosing **DOWN to (6, 1)**! Here's why:\n\n1. **SAFETY:** (6, 1) is empty and will remain empty (no snakes there, no apples that could attract enemy immediately).\n2. **APPLE PRIORITY:** I'm now 1 cell from (6, 0) apple! That's the closest apple to me. From (6,1), I can go DOWN to eat (6,0) next turn. That's my path to victory.\n3. **ENEMY DISTANCE:** Enemy is at (2,5) - they're 5+ cells away from (6,0) and (5,1). I can grab an apple before they reach my hunting ground.\n4. **MULTIPLE OPTIONS:** From (6,1), I can:\n   - Go DOWN to (6,0) \u2192 eat apple \u2192 grow to length 3\n   - Go LEFT to (5,1) \u2192 eat apple \u2192 grow to length 3 (another apple!)\n   - Go LEFT to (5,1) then UP to (5,2) etc.\n5. **SPACE MANAGEMENT:** Bottom row is clear. I won't get boxed in.\n6. **SCORE GAP:** Need to close the 1-5 deficit! Every apple is crucial content and survival.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab (6,0) next turn \u2192 then chase (5,1) \u2192 then (3,0) or (5,7) if available. Once I have 3-4 apples, I'll start positioning to trap the enemy against the walls. The bottom-left corner will be MY kingdom!\n\nLet's GOOOOO! DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

From UP we can swing left, right, or keep going up \u2014 flexibility matters when you\u2019re boxing someone in. More options = more ways to force them into a choke. \ud83e\udded\n- DOWN gets us closer to the y=4 corridor faster, but also risks locking us into our own body geometry (less room to pivot) and could open a trap if the opponent counters. Too narrow \u2014 don\u2019t tunnel ourselves. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT is fine for lateral control (what we did last turn), but repeating left drifts away from a strong central pivot point. We want to control the center so we can intercept their approach from x\u22485\u20136 later. \ud83c\udfaf\n- UP leaves our body shape intact while the tail vacates behind us (no apples underfoot), so we maintain mobility to either snatch a head-on win (we\u2019re up 5\u21921) or slam the door shut if they try to sneak in.\n\nOpponent thinking (6,2):\n- Their legal moves: LEFT (5,2), DOWN (6,1), or RIGHT (7,2). They need multiple turns to climb into our side (5,3 \u2192 5,4 etc.). UP gives us time and flexibility to intercept or force a head-on when they get greedy. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to keep options open.  \n- If they push left/up toward x=5, pivot rightward and drop down to cut their approach and threaten a head-on \u2014 we win trades on account of our apple lead.  \n- If they retreat or play safe, use the extra space to reposition into the center and gradually close lanes, forcing them into tighter choices. Keep pressure, don\u2019t get boxed.\n\nLET\u2019S TURN THE SCREW \u2014 UP",

Now they're hunting the top-left apples at (1,7) and (1,9).\n- Enemy body now: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] - They grew last turn by eating? Wait, they had 5 apples before. If they ate at (2,5) or nearby, they'd be at 6 apples. But I don't see an apple at (2,5)... Actually, maybe they didn't eat but the tail shifted. They're now at (2,6) so they might be chasing something. Let me count: Their body is 5 segments now? Head (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) - that's 6 segments total. They grew one from last turn? Hmm. Doesn't matter - they're still ahead in score.\n\n**MOVES FROM (6,1):**\n\n1. **UP to (6,2):** DANGER! That's my own body! I'd die instantly.

BUT... from there, my only safe moves would be UP (back to (6,1), which will be empty next turn but might be risky) or LEFT to (5,0) which is empty. Not bad actually.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,1):** SAFE! (5,1) is an apple! I'd eat it, grow to length 3, score 2 apples. From there, I could go LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) or UP to (5,2).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7,1):** SAFE! (7,1) is empty. Moves me toward the apple at (7,0) but away from my main hunting ground. Not ideal.\n\n**THE CALL - I'M GOING DOWN TO (6,0)!**\n\n**WHY THIS IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE CONTENT:** I grab an apple THIS TURN! No waiting, no setup moves. Score becomes 2-5, closing the gap.\n2. **SAFETY FIRST:** (6,0) is empty and will stay empty (no enemy near bottom right).\n3. **FUTURE MOVES:** From (6,0) next turn, I have options:\n   - UP back to (6,1) - if it's safe\n   - LEFT to (5,0) - empty, then can go to (5,1) which will still have the apple? Wait, (5,1) is also an apple! But if I eat (6,0) now, the board updates. Actually, both (6,0) and (5,1) are apples. I can eat one now and the other next turn if still there.\n4. **ENEMY LOCATION:** Enemy is at (2,6) going after top-left apples. They're 7+ cells away from my hunting ground. I have time.\n5. **NO TRAP RISK:** Bottom row is wide open. I won't get boxed in.\n6. **SCORE GAP:** I need to eat FAST to catch up. Waiting is losing.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (6,0) \u2192 then grab (5,1) \u2192 then either (3,0) or start positioning to block enemy paths.

We want to posture centrally and force them into a choke later while we keep the apple lead. \ud83d\ude08\n- LEFT is tempting (near an apple at 1,7) but it drifts us sideways and slightly narrows escape routes along our own body. RIGHT pulls toward center quicker but edges us closer to cells adjacent to our body at (3,5), which could complicate pivots next turn.\n- UP preserves space above us and creates the most clean follow-ups (UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn), making it easier to react to whatever the opponent does while still moving toward the center of the map.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to keep options open and retain control of central lanes.\n- If opponent drifts up/left toward mid, pivot right and then drop down to cut their path and force a head-on (we win head-on trades; we\u2019re ahead on apples).\n- If they play safe, we keep tightening the net and pick up nearby apples safely while avoiding self-boxes. Keep pressure, never get funneled into our own body.\n\nFinal read: safe, flexible, aggressive posture to convert our apple lead into a board lock. Time to squeeze.\n\nUP",

Actually wait - (6,1) is currently my body, so moving there would be hitting myself. **DEAD**. NOPE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n2. **LEFT to (5,0):** SAFE! (5,0) is empty. Moves me toward the apple at (5,1) which is still there (I didn't eat it yet). This is the move!\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,0):** SAFE! (7,0) is an apple! I could eat it and grow to length 4, score 3 apples (wait, I already have 3, so this would be 4). But... from (7,0) I'd be in a corner with only UP or LEFT as options. That's limiting.\n\n4. **DOWN to (6,-1):** OFF BOARD - DEAD. Obviously not.\n\n**THE CALL - I'M GOING LEFT TO (5,0)!**\n\n**WHY THIS IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **MAD CONTENT:** I'm positioning RIGHT NEXT to TWO apples: (5,1) above me and (3,0) two steps left. I can grab (5,1) next turn and then (3,0) after!\n2. **SPACE TO MOVE:** From (5,0), I can go UP to (5,1), LEFT to (4,0), or RIGHT back to (6,0). No corners, no traps. Maximum flexibility.\n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy is going for top-left apples. They're 8+ cells away. They're not contesting my territory. I can safely farm the bottom row.\n4. **SCORE GAP:** I'm at 3 apples, they're at 5. I need to eat FAST to catch up. (5,1) is the immediate target.\n5. **BLOCKING SETUP:** Once I have 4-5 apples, I can start positioning to cut off enemy paths to their apples. The bottom-left corridor is MINE to control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 14: Move UP to (5,1) and eat that apple (score 4 apples). \nTurn 15: Move LEFT to (4,1) or (4,0) to position for (3,0) apple.\nThen: Farm bottom row apples (3,0), then move toward (1,7) or (1,9) to start applying pressure on enemy's hunting ground. Once I have 5+ apples, I can start aggressive boxing maneuvers!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to claim my apple farm! Let's gooooo!\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Time to be greedy and make moves that increase our lead and tighten the noose.\n\nQuick legal sweep from head (2,7):\n- UP \u2192 (2,8): safe, keeps center control \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7): safe AND there\u2019s an apple \u2014 instant +1 growth and +1 apple (6 apples) \u2705 (very tasty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7): safe, moves toward our body but still okay \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6): ILLEGAL (that\u2019s our neck) \u274c\n\nOpponent read (head at 6,0; body at 6,1 & 6,2):\n- They cannot move UP (that\u2019s their neck/backwards). Their realistic moves this turn: LEFT to (5,0) or RIGHT to (7,0) \u2014 the latter is an apple and very likely. They\u2019re stuck on the bottom row and will probably grab (7,0) and push up from there.\n- Head-on this turn? Nope \u2014 way too far. But we\u2019re ahead, so we should grow to widen our advantage and then force conflict later.\n\nWhy LEFT (1,7) is the play:\n- Immediate apple = +1 apple (we go to 6) which strengthens our ability to pressure head-on later. More apples = more leverage. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Growing now both increases board presence (helps box) and denies that apple to any future contest.\n- LEFT still leaves good pivoting options: from (1,7) we can go UP to control top lanes, RIGHT to re-enter center, or drop down later to chase/box. It doesn\u2019t funnel us into our own tail immediately.\n- UP/RIGHT are safe, but they pass up a free apple when we\u2019re supposed to be aggressive. We want to convert our lead into intimidating board presence.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (1,7) now to push apples to 6. That gives us freedom to force risky engagements later.\n- From (1,7) pivot toward center (x\u22482\u20134) while monitoring the opponent as they climb off the bottom row. Aim to cut their path into the middle column and corral them against the bottom wall.\n- If they try to sprint for apples and open themselves, look to step into their path and force a head-on when we have the higher score (we win head-ons).\n- Avoid turning into our own body cluster around x=3\u20134; keep a 2\u20133 cell buffer as we move down.\n\nFinal read: safe, aggressive, take the apple and increase our lead. Time to choke the board.\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 2 (still, since I didn't eat an apple that turn).\n- **Enemy head at (1,7)**, body at [(2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. They're still at 6 apples. I'm 4 apples behind now.\n- **Apple map:** Looking at the board, I see apples at (5,1) RIGHT above my head, (3,0) two steps LEFT, (1,9) top-left, (0,2) bottom-left, (0,3), (1,0) is empty, (9,0), (9,2), (9,7), (3,3), (2,0), and more.

I'd eat it, grow to length 3, score becomes 3 apples. CHECK SAFETY: The path goes (6,0)\u2192(6,1)\u2192... But I need to see what's blocking. My body goes (6,0)\u2192(6,1)\u2192... Actually wait, let me trace carefully. My current body is [(6,0), (6,1)]. So my neck is (6,0). If I move UP to (5,1), my new body becomes [(5,0), (6,0), (6,1)]. The old tail (6,1) moves away. So the path is (5,0)\u2192(6,0)\u2192(6,1). There's NO collision here! (5,1) is empty except for the apple. **SAFE AND DELICIOUS!**\n\n2. **LEFT to (4,0):** SAFE! (4,0) is empty. This gets me closer to the apple at (3,0) and (2,0). But I'd be missing the immediate apple at (5,1).\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6,0):** DEAD! (6,0) is currently my body (the neck). Moving back into my own body = death. NOPE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n4. **DOWN to (5,-1):** OFF BOARD - DEAD. Obviously not.\n\n**THE CALL - I'M GOING UP TO (5,1) TO EAT THAT APPLE!**\n\n**WHY THIS IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE CONTENT:** I get an apple RIGHT NOW! Score goes from 2 to 3 apples. That's one less apple I'm behind the enemy.\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (5,1), I'll be in the center of the board with TONS of options. I can go UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1), or DOWN back to (5,0). No corners, maximum flexibility.\n3. **ENEMY IS FARTHER AWAY:** Enemy is at (1,7) in the top-left quadrant. They're NOT coming for my apple at (5,1). This is free real estate!\n4. **SCORE GAP CLOSING:** Enemy has 6 apples, I have 2. If I eat this one, I'll have 3. Still behind, but I'm closing the gap while they're hunting in the top-left. Every apple counts!\n5. **CONTROL THE CENTER:** By eating at (5,1), I'm securing the center-left area. This blocks enemy paths later when I want to trap them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 15: From (5,1), move LEFT to (4,1) or LEFT to (4,0) to position for (3,0) apple. Or maybe UP to (5,2) to scout the middle.\nThen: Keep farming bottom-center apples. After I get 4-5 apples, I need to start getting AGGRESSIVE. Enemy is long (7 segments) but slow.

The enemy is at (1,8) moving UP toward (1,9) - they're chasing the apple at (1,9) in the top-left. They're NOT coming down to (5,2).\n3. **DOMINATING THE BOTTOM:** By moving LEFT, I'm claiming the bottom-left quadrant. This blocks the enemy's potential path to (3,0) and (2,0) later. I'm boxing them into the top-left!\n4. **SCORE GAP:** I'm still 3 apples behind. I need to keep farming safely. The bottom-left apples are guaranteed food while the enemy fights over the top-left corner.\n5. **AVOIDING HEAD-ON:** If I move UP, I might accidentally meet the enemy if they decide to move RIGHT from (1,8). But moving LEFT keeps me away from their path.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 15: Move LEFT to (4,1) to position for (3,0) apple.\nTurn 16: Move LEFT to (3,1) or DOWN to (4,0), then grab (3,0) apple (score becomes 4).\nTurn 17: Move to (2,0) or (2,1) to grab the apple at (2,0) (score becomes 5).\nOnce I have 5-6 apples, I'll be close enough to start pressuring the enemy. Their body is long (7 segments) - I can try to cut them off by moving toward their head's direction or boxing them into the corner!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to secure the bottom-left and set up for the next apple! Let's gooooo!",

Their realistic moves are LEFT to (4,1) or UP to (5,2). They're climbing off the bottom row into the center \u2014 perfect for us to funnel them later.\n- If we take the apple now, we go to 7 apples.

Wait, the replay says I was at (5,1) and moved UP. Let me check the logic again.\n\n**CHECKING THE BOARD STATE:**\n- My head: (5,2)\n- My body: [(5,1), (5,0), (6,0)]\n- Enemy head: (1,9) - that's the apple! He ate it.\n- Enemy body: [(1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\n**MOVES FROM (5,2):**\n\n1. **UP to (5,3):** SAFE! (5,3) is empty. My body becomes [(5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. CHECK SAFETY: No collision. **SAFE.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,1):** DEAD! (5,1) is currently my body. Moving back into my own neck = death. NOPE!\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,2):** SAFE! (4,2) is empty. My body becomes [(5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. No collision. **SAFE.**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,2):** SAFE! (6,2) is empty. My body becomes [(5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. No collision. **SAFE.**\n\n**THE PLAN - CHASING THE ENEMY!**\n\nThe enemy is now at (1,9) - top-left corner. They're trapped in the top-left box! Look at the board:\n\n- Enemy head: (1,9)\n- Enemy body extends down and right: [(1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nI need to move UP to cut them off! From (5,2), moving UP gets me to (5,3), which positions me to start moving toward their head's direction.\n\n**ENEMY PATHING:** From (1,9), they can only move DOWN (back to (1,8)) or RIGHT (to (2,9)). If they move RIGHT to (2,9), they're heading into the top-right area where I can intercept.\n\n**MY STRATEGY:** Move UP to (5,3) and keep moving UP to get to the top row. Once I'm at y=8 or y=9, I can move LEFT to block their escape route. If they try to move RIGHT from (1,9) to (2,9), I need to be there to cut them off.\n\n**SCORE GAP:** They have 7 apples, I have 3. I'm 4 behind. But they're cornered! If I can trap them and force a collision where I win, I close the gap instantly.\n\n**THE CALL:** UP to (5,3) - getting closer to the top row to start boxing them in. Let's gooooo!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 16: Move UP to (5,3) - positioning for top row control\nTurn 17: Move UP to (5,4) or UP to (5,5) - climbing toward y=9\nTurn 18: Move LEFT toward (2,9) or (3,9) to block enemy's escape path\nOnce I'm on the top row (y=9), I can move LEFT to trap them in the corner. If they move RIGHT into me, they die. If they move DOWN and I block their path, they eventually run out of space and die.\n\nI'm the hunter now. They're the prey. Time to end this!\n\nUP",

We won\u2019t be in immediate danger from the opponent this turn.\n- Yes, DOWN slightly reduces our options next turn (we\u2019ll basically have to go RIGHT after eating), but that sequence (DOWN to apple \u2192 RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 then push toward mid) is exactly the aggressive pressure we want to start boxing them with.\n\nShort-term plan (will appear as next-turn rationale):\n- Eat (2,8) now to cement the lead.\n- Then go RIGHT to (3,8), then DOWN into mid-lane (3,7 \u2192 3,6) to start hemming the rival in.\n- Force them into a narrowing corridor and bait a head-on since we will have the apple advantage.

No immediate danger.  \n- **DOWN to (5,3):** My own body! That\u2019s a death move.  \n- **LEFT to (4,4):** Empty. Safe?  \n- **RIGHT to (6,4):** Empty. Safe?  \n\n**ANALYSIS:**  \n1. **DOWN is DEAD** \u2014 into my own neck.  \n2. **UP to (5,5):** Moving toward the top row. The enemy is at (2,8), so they\u2019re to my LEFT and UP.

Not what we want!  \n4. **RIGHT to (6,4):** Also safe, but moves me right\u2014away from the enemy.  \n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**  \nI need to chase them down and trap them in the corner. They\u2019re at (2,8), and I\u2019m at (5,4). By going UP to (5,5), I\u2019m climbing toward the top rows (y=6,7,8,9). Once I\u2019m at y=8 or 9, I can move LEFT (x=4,3,2) to block their escape path.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- UP keeps me safe for now. No immediate collision.  \n- Enemy might move DOWN to (2,7) or RIGHT to (3,8), but I\u2019ll be at (5,5) \u2014 far enough to adjust.  \n- If I go LEFT or RIGHT, I\u2019m wasting time. The enemy is growing faster!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 18: UP to (5,5) \u2014 climbing the ladder.  \nTurn 19: Continue UP to (5,6) or (5,7) \u2014 get to the top.  \nTurn 20: Move LEFT toward x=4 or x=3 at y=8 or y=9 to box them in.  \nOnce I\u2019m on the top rows, I can squeeze them into the corner between (0,9) and (2,9).

Don\u2019t be that guy. \ud83d\udeab\n- UP \u2192 (5,9) is safe and eats an apple (nice), but it drifts away from the enemy and gives them room to wiggle. \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) is safe and also eats an apple, keeps pressure on the right flank. \ud83d\udc40\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7) moves straight into the enemy head \u2014 risky if they bite up, but guess what? We\u2019re leading 9\u21925. If they go UP and we both collide head-on, double KO = we WIN. If they dodge left/right, we safely occupy (5,7) and crush their space. Aggression wins here. \ud83d\udca5\n\nWhy DOWN: being up by 4 apples means forcing a head-on is advantageous. Also moving down immediately pins them to their own spine (they can\u2019t go DOWN), and if they sidestep we get central control at x=5. This is the moment to be ruthless \u2014 threaten the head-on and make them panic.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Turn 21: move DOWN into (5,7) to either force the double-KO (we win) or take the central column.\n- If they dodge, next moves aim to cut off escape (push RIGHT then DOWN/LEFT as needed) while keeping at least one escape route for us.\n- Avoid hugging our own tail; maintain 2+ options each turn and gobble nearby apples only when it doesn\u2019t sacrifice boxing pressure.\n\nDOWN",
