          "rationale": "My current position is (5, 8) and my body is at [(5, 7)].\nThe enemy snake 1 is at (3, 5) with body at [(4, 5), (4, 6)].\nApples are at (1, 7), (3, 7), (9, 0), (3, 2), (9, 8).\nThe board size is 10x10.\n\nLet's determine my valid moves from (5, 8):\n- UP to (5, 9): Within board boundaries, no collision with my body or the enemy snake/body. Valid.\n- DOWN to (5, 7): This cell is occupied by my body. Invalid.\n- LEFT to (4, 8): Within board boundaries, no collision with my body or the enemy snake/body. Valid.\n- RIGHT to (6, 8): Within board boundaries, no collision with my body or the enemy snake/body. Valid.\n\nMy valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nThe closest apple from my current position (5, 8) is at (3, 7) with a Manhattan distance of |5-3| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe second closest apple is at (9, 8) with a Manhattan distance of |5-9| + |8-8| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves based on the closest apple (3, 7):\n- Moving UP to (5, 9): Distance to (3, 7) is |5-3| + |9-7| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Increases distance)\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 8): Distance to (3, 7) is |4-3| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Decreases distance)\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 8): Distance to (3, 7) is |6-3| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Increases distance)\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 8) is the only valid move that decreases the Manhattan distance to the closest apple (3, 7).\n\nLet's evaluate the valid moves based on the second closest apple (9, 8):\n- Moving UP to (5, 9): Distance to (9, 8) is |5-9| + |9-8| = 4 + 1 = 5. (Increases distance)\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 8): Distance to (9, 8) is |4-9| + |8-8| = 5 + 0 = 5. (Increases distance)\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 8): Distance to (9, 8) is |6-9| + |8-8| = 3 + 0 = 3. (Decreases distance)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 8) decreases the distance to the second closest apple (9, 8).\n\nStrategy: Prioritize moving towards the closest apple unless the path is unsafe or leads to being trapped. The closest apple is at (3, 7). The path to (3, 7) via (4, 8) appears clear. The enemy snake is positioned below and to my left, not directly blocking the path to (3, 7) from my current position. Moving LEFT gets me closer to the primary target.\n\nThe path from (5, 8) -> (4, 8) leads towards (3, 7). The cells (4, 8), and potential subsequent cells like (4, 7) or (3, 8) are not currently occupied by the enemy snake head (3, 5) or body [(4, 5), (4, 6)]. This path seems safe for the immediate next move.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the best move to get closer to the most accessible apple.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"
