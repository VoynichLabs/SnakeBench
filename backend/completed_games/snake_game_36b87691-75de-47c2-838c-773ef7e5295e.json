Your possible moves:\n   - UP: (0,9) \u2192 no overlap with enemy.\n   - DOWN: (1,8) \u2192 no overlap.\n   - RIGHT: (1,8) \u2192 no overlap.\n   - LEFT: invalid (already eliminated).\n\n   No immediate danger from enemy.\n\n### Safe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- Your current position is (0,8). Apples are at:\n  - (6,4): far away.\n  - (3,5): far away.\n  - (1,8): adjacent to your current y-coordinate (same y=8, x=1 vs x=0). Moving RIGHT to (1,8) would place you next to this apple.\n  - (3,8): far away.\n  - (8,4): far away.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,8) is the closest to an apple (1,8). This is a good immediate win opportunity.\n- Moving UP or DOWN would not place you near any apple, so they are less optimal for short-term gains.\n\n### Future Considerations:\n- If you move RIGHT to (1,8), your snake will grow to two segments: head at (1,8), tail at (0,8).\n- The enemy is at (4,1), which is far away and unlikely to interfere in the near future.\n- Avoiding LEFT is already handled by eliminating it.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Next turn**: If you move RIGHT, your snake will be at (1,8) with tail at (0,8). You should now consider moving towards the nearest apple, which is (1,8) (already eaten) or (3,5) or (6,4). Moving DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (0,8) (but LEFT is off-board) or RIGHT to (2,8) could be considered. Prioritize moving towards (3,5) or (6,4) to maximize growth.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe safest and most immediate winning move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a **backwards move** and counts as self-collision \u2192 **Invalid**.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,6) is safe (no body or apple there).\n- Moving DOWN to (2,6) is safe (no body or apple there).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves**\n#### **Option 1: LEFT to (0,6)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward (3,5) and (3,8) apples (closer to (3,5)).\n  - No immediate risk of collision.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Moving left to x=0 is a boundary edge. If enemy moves toward you, you may get trapped.\n  - Future moves may be restricted if you stay too far left.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN to (2,6)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward (6,4) and (3,5) apples (closer to (6,4)).\n  - Keeps flexibility in future moves (not near boundary).\n- **Cons:**\n  - No immediate apple gain, but better long-term positioning.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Enemy Threat Assessment**\n- Enemy is at (4,4) with no body. It can move in any direction.\n- If enemy moves toward your snake, it could collide with you if you stay too far left (LEFT to (0,6)).\n- If enemy moves toward (2,6), it could collide with you if you move there.\n\n**Risk of collision:**\n- Enemy\u2019s possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,5)\n  - DOWN: (5,4)\n  - LEFT: (3,4)\n  - RIGHT: (5,4)\n\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), it could collide with you if you move LEFT to (0,6) (no direct collision, but future moves may be restricted).\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,4), it could collide with you if you move DOWN to (2,6) (no direct collision, but future moves may be restricted).\n\n**Conclusion:** Both moves are safe, but **DOWN** is better because it keeps your snake in a more central position, reducing future risk of being trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Apple Proximity and Growth Potential**\n- **LEFT to (0,6):**\n  - Closer to (3,5) and (3,8) apples.\n  - Next turn, you could move RIGHT to (1,6) or DOWN to (1,7).\n- **DOWN to (2,6):**\n  - Closer to (6,4) and (3,5) apples.\n  - Next turn, you could move LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6).\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of apple proximity, but **DOWN** is slightly better because it keeps your snake in a more central position, reducing future risk of being trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Long-Term Strategy Note**\n**Turn 3 (Current Move):**\n- Move DOWN to (2,6). This keeps your snake in a central position and reduces future risk of being trapped.\n\n**Turn 4:**\n- Move LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6) to avoid enemy if it grows.\n\n**Turn 5:**\n- Prioritize (6,4) and (3,5) apples for future growth.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\nDOWN",
