Your head is at (7, 2). The closest possible collision would be if you move to (7, 3) and the enemy moves to (7, 3) simultaneously, but since the enemy is at (2, 6), it cannot reach (7, 3) in one move. The enemy's head is far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple to your head is (7, 3), which is one cell down from your current position (7, 2). This is a direct move.\n- Other apples are farther away (e.g., (7, 8) is up, (0, 5) is left and up, etc.).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since your snake is just a single cell, you can safely move toward the closest apple (7, 3) without risking collision or death.\n- Moving down to (7, 3) is the safest and most logical choice, as it directly advances toward the nearest apple.\n\n### Long-term Plan (for future self):\n- **Turn 1**: Move down to (7, 3) to eat the apple.\n- **Turn 2**: Your snake will now be at (7, 3) with no body. The enemy is still at (2, 6). The next closest apple is (6, 1) or (9, 1). Prioritize (6, 1) as it is closer diagonally, but since you can only move one step at a time, move down to (8, 3) or right to (7, 4) to avoid blocking yourself or enemies.\n- **Turn 3**: If you moved down to (8, 3), consider moving right to (8, 4) or left to (7, 4) to avoid potential enemy movement.\n\n### Final Move:\nDOWN",

Moving left or down both bring you nearer to that apple over subsequent turns; UP or RIGHT move away from it.\n- Choice rationale: Pick LEFT to start decreasing x toward the nearest apple while keeping options open for future turns. No immediate threats from the enemy.\n- Short-term plan: (2,6) -> (1,6) next turn, then aim for (0,6) -> (0,5) to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",
