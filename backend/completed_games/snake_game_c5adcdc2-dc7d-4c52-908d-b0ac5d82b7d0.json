The closest apple to me now is at (6, 2), which is above and to the left of me. However, considering the enemy snake's position, moving directly to it might put me in danger of collision if it decides to move down.\n\nBut since the enemy snake is already above me and hasn't moved down yet, I should prioritize getting the apple at (6, 2) as it is closer to me and also safer considering the other apples on the board.\n\nNext turn strategy: Check if the enemy snake has moved towards me and plan accordingly. Also, keep an eye on the other apples on the board and adjust my strategy if needed.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

This is clearly the best move as I can immediately gain a point by eating this apple.\n\nAfter I move DOWN and eat the apple, I'll need to consider my next steps carefully. The enemy snake could potentially try to cut me off if it moves LEFT, but I'll have more options after growing.\n\n# Strategy for next turn\nAfter moving DOWN to eat the apple at (6, 2), I'll likely want to continue moving LEFT to avoid the enemy snake and head toward the other apples at (3, 4) and (3, 1). I should remember that after eating the apple, my body will be longer, so I'll need to be more careful about collision paths.\n\nDOWN"
