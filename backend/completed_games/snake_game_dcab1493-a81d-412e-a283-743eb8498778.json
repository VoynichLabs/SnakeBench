The enemy's move into the corner (9, 9) has put them at a disadvantage. My best strategy is to rush straight for this cluster to secure the apples before the opponent can arrive.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 6) is the most direct path.\nMoving UP (7, 8) moves away from the apples.\nMoving LEFT (6, 7) maintains lateral distance but does not gain vertical ground towards the cluster.\nMoving RIGHT (8, 7) moves closer to the enemy's vertical line but is unnecessary as I am already aligned with column 7 which contains two of the apples.\n\nImmediate safety check:\nMy move: DOWN to (7, 6).\nEnemy is at (9, 9).

Once in the cluster, I will maneuver to pick up (8, 1) and (9, 1) while monitoring the enemy's approach.\n\nDOWN",
