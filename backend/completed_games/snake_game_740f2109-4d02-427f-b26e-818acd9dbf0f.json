There\u2019s no risk of collision if I move downward.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Immediate Goal:** Collect the closest apple at (2, 3) for an easy point. This puts me in a safe position to reassess my next target.\n2. **Future Moves:** After securing (2, 3), I\u2019ll likely head RIGHT to move toward (5, 3). This avoids dead ends and keeps me closer to other apples.\n3. **Safety First:** I\u2019ll continue to avoid retracing my path and steer clear of the enemy snake near the top-right corner.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe most efficient move is to head **DOWN** toward the apple at (2, 3). This is a low-risk, high-reward option.\n\n### **Next Turn Strategy:**\n\n1. Reassess after eating the apple at (2, 3).\n2. Move toward (5, 3) if it\u2019s still open or evaluate new opportunities.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN.**",
