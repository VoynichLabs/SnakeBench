No body segments yet.\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1)**: Only head at (4,3). No body segments yet.\n- **Objective**: Grow safely while avoiding collisions (with walls, self, or enemy).\n\n### **Key Observations**\n1. **No body segments**: Since neither snake has grown yet, the only collision risk is head-on with the enemy.\n2. **Enemy position**: Snake #1 is at (4,3). If we move toward it, we risk a head-on collision if it moves toward us.\n3. **Apples reachable in one move**:\n   - From (9,5), moving **LEFT** (x decreases by 1) would take us to (8,5), which is not an apple.\n   - Moving **DOWN** (y decreases by 1) would take us to (9,4), not an apple.\n   - Moving **UP** (y increases by 1) would take us to (9,6), which is an apple! This is a strong candidate.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** (x increases by 1) would take us to (9,5) \u2192 (10,5), which is off the board (x=10 is invalid). **Eliminate RIGHT**.\n\n### **Safe Moves Evaluation**\n- **UP**: (9,5) \u2192 (9,6) (apple). Safe, as no snake occupies (9,6) yet.\n- **DOWN**: (9,5) \u2192 (9,4). Safe, but no apple.\n- **LEFT**: (9,5) \u2192 (8,5). Safe, but no apple.\n\n**UP** is the best immediate move because:\n- It collects an apple (instant growth and point).\n- No collision risk (enemy is at (4,3), far away).\n- Future growth will depend on how Snake #1 moves, but for now, this is optimal.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- Prioritize apples that are reachable in one move to grow quickly.\n- Avoid moving directly toward the enemy unless forced (risk of head-on collision).\n- If no apples are reachable in one move, prioritize positions that maximize future flexibility (e.g., center of the board).\n- Watch for enemy movement patterns to anticipate collisions.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nUP",

Now your snake has **2 segments**: head at (9,6), body at [(9,5)].\n\n#### **Key Observations**\n1. **Your snake's body now occupies (9,5) and (9,6)**. Moving **DOWN** from (9,6) would take you to (9,5), which is your own tail. This is **backwards movement** and would kill you.\n   - **Eliminate DOWN**.\n\n2. **Enemy position**: Snake #1 is at (4,4). It has no body, so the only collision risk is if its head moves into your body or vice versa.\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**, its new position would be (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), or (5,4), respectively.

This means you must prioritize **safe movement that keeps future options open** while avoiding potential head-on collisions.\n\n4. **Future flexibility**:\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (8,6) or **RIGHT** to (9,7) are both safe and leave you in a position where you can explore more of the board.\n   - **LEFT** is slightly better because:\n     - (8,6) is closer to the center of the board, giving more options for future growth.\n     - (9,7) is near the edge, which might limit future movements if Snake #1 starts to grow and block paths.\n\n#### **Safe Moves Evaluation**\n- **LEFT**: (9,6) \u2192 (8,6). Safe, no collision risk. Keeps options open.\n- **RIGHT**: (9,6) \u2192 (9,7). Safe, but near the edge. Less optimal for long-term flexibility.\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- Since no apples are reachable in one move, prioritize **centralizing your position** to maximize future flexibility.\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy unless necessary (Snake #1 is at (4,4), far from your current position).\n- If Snake #1 grows and blocks potential paths, adjust accordingly.\n- Keep an eye on apples at (6,3) and (5,2), which are closer to the center and might become reachable soon.\n\n#### **Final Decision**\nLEFT",

You must prioritize **safe movement that keeps future options open** while avoiding potential head-on collisions.\n\n4. **Future flexibility**:\n   - Moving **UP** to (8,7) is safe and near the center of the board.\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (7,6) is also safe but slightly closer to the edge.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (7,6) is safe but would take you to the same position as moving **DOWN** (since your head is at (8,6), moving left would be (7,6)).\n   - **UP** is better than **DOWN** or **LEFT** because:\n     - (8,7) is closer to the center and leaves more options for future growth.\n     - (7,6) is closer to the edge, which might limit future movements if Snake #1 starts to grow and block paths.\n\n#### **Safe Moves Evaluation**\n- **UP**: (8,6) \u2192 (8,7). Safe, no collision risk. Keeps options open.\n- **DOWN**: (8,6) \u2192 (7,6). Safe, but less optimal for long-term flexibility.\n- **LEFT**: (8,6) \u2192 (7,6). Same as **DOWN**, less optimal.\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- Since no apples are reachable in one move, prioritize **centralizing your position** to maximize future flexibility.\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy unless necessary (Snake #1 is at (4,5), far from your current position).\n- Keep an eye on apples at (6,3) and (5,2), which are closer to the center and might become reachable soon.\n- If Snake #1 grows and blocks potential paths, adjust accordingly.\n- If Snake #1 moves toward you, ensure you have multiple safe escape routes.\n\n#### **Final Decision**\nUP\n\n---**Future Plan**---\n- Avoid moving toward the edge of the board to maintain flexibility.\n- Prioritize apples near the center (e.g., (6,3), (5,2), (3,3)) as they are more accessible for future growth.\n- Monitor Snake #1's movements to avoid head-on collisions or getting trapped.\n- If possible, aim to create a path that allows you to collect multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked.\n\n---",

It has no body, so the only collision risk is if its head moves into your body or vice versa.\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**, its new position would be (4,7), (3,6), (3,6), or (5,6), respectively.\n   - None of these overlap with your current body [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7)].\n\n3. **Apples reachable in one move**:\n   - None of the apples are directly reachable in one move from (8,7).\n   - The closest apples are at (6,3), (5,2), and (3,3).

Keeps options open and moves you toward the center.\n   - **DOWN**: (8,7) \u2192 (7,7). Safe, but slightly closer to the edge (y=7 is near the top).\n   - **LEFT**: (8,7) \u2192 (7,7). Same as **DOWN**, less optimal.\n   - **RIGHT**: (8,7) \u2192 (9,7).

Safe.\n   - **DOWN**: (7,7) \u2192 (8,7). **Backwards into your own body!** This would kill you.\n   - **LEFT**: (7,7) \u2192 (6,7). Same as **UP**.\n   - **RIGHT**: (7,7) \u2192 (8,7). **Backwards into your own body!** This would kill you.\n\n   **Correction**: The head is at (7,7), and the body is [(8,7), (8,6)]. This means the snake is **UP** from (8,7) and **UP** from (8,6), so moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** from (7,7) would hit your own body. Only **UP** and **LEFT** are safe.\n\n2. **Enemy position**: Snake #1 is at (3,3) with body [(3,4)].\n   - If Snake #1 moves **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**, its new position would be (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), or (4,3), respectively.\n   - Its body is at (3,4), so moving **UP** from (3,3) would hit its own body (killing it). Moving **DOWN** would go to (3,4), which is its own body (killing it). Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** would be safe for Snake #1.\n\n3. **Apples reachable in one move**:\n   - No apples are directly reachable from (7,7) in one move.\n\n4. **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n   - **UP/LEFT**: Both are safe and move you toward the center.\n   - **UP** moves you toward (6,7), which is closer to the apple at (8,2) if you plan to move **DOWN** later.\n   - **LEFT** moves you toward (6,7), which is the same as **UP** in this case.\n\n5. **Long-Term Strategy**:\n   - Snake #1 is still far from you, so immediate collision risk is low.\n   - Moving **UP** toward (6,7) is the only safe option now. This keeps future options open.\n   - Avoid dead-ends: (6,7) is a central position, allowing flexibility to move toward any apple.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns**\n- **Turn 11**: Move **UP** to (6,7) to avoid immediate death and stay flexible.\n- **Turn 12**: Assess Snake #1's movement and potential threats. If safe, move **UP** or **LEFT** toward apples.\n- **Turn 13-14**: Continue moving **UP** or **LEFT** to reach the apple at (8,2) or others while avoiding Snake #1.\n- **Future**: After collecting an apple, reassess the board and plan the next apple collection, prioritizing flexibility and avoiding dead-ends.\n\nUP",
