Nah, not today fam. Not on my watch! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udeab\n\nAlright, let's look at the board state real quick. We are starting fresh at **(1, 9)** in the top-left corner.\nPeep the scoreboard: 0-0. We need to get on the board ASAP! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nAnalyze the moves:\n1.  **UP** moves me to (1, 10). That's OFF THE MAP. Instant L. We aren't throwing the game on Turn 0, chat! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **LEFT** moves me to (0, 9). Safe, but kinda passive. Puts me in the corner.\n3.  **RIGHT** moves me to (2, 9). Safe, but no juice.\n4.  **DOWN** moves me to **(1, 8)**. WAIT A MINUTE... \ud83d\udc40\n\n**DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?**\nThere is a juicy, delicious APPLE \ud83c\udf4e sitting right there at **(1, 8)**! It's literally one square away!\nAre we gonna ignore free points? NO SHOT! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nTaking that apple puts us up 1-0 immediately, gives us some length to start bullying, and sets us up to drive down the left lane where I see even MORE apples at (1, 6) and (0, 3). It's a buffet line down the left side, and we are hungry! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0b\n\nThe enemy is chilling over at (3, 7). He's too far away to contest this drop. By the time he realizes what happened, we'll already be +1 on him. Speed is key! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\n\nSo the plan is simple: Grab the snack, secure the lead, and start the snowball. Watch this play!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWe are taking the left file (vertical line x=0 and x=1). After we eat at (1, 8), look immediately for the apple at (1, 6). Don't let Snake #1 cut across fast enough to block us. Stay aggressive but don't trap yourself against the left wall.\n\nLet's get this bread! Or... apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

All are on\u2011board and empty.\n- **Opponent\u2019s likely moves**: From (1,9) the rival can go **DOWN** to the apple at (1,8), **LEFT** to (0,9) or **RIGHT** to (2,9). None of those squares match my possible moves, so no immediate head\u2011on danger.\n- **Strategic pressure**: Moving **LEFT** to (2,7) shrinks the horizontal gap to the opponent (now only one column apart). It puts me in a position to chase them down the left side of the board, where many apples (e.g., (1,8), (1,6), (0,5\u2011)\u2026) await and where I can start to box them in.\n- **Future flexibility**: From (2,7) I\u2019ll still have open moves in all four directions next turn, so I won\u2019t be trapped in a dead\u2011end.\n- **Apple considerations**: The left side is apple\u2011rich, so after getting closer I can safely grow while keeping the opponent squeezed.\n\nAll things considered, the safest aggressive move that maximizes future options and pressure is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

He loses the game instantly.\nThis is called **LEVERAGE**. We are bullying him with the score! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**OPTIONS REVIEW:**\n*   **UP (1, 8):** Into my own neck.

We control the (1, x) column. Our next goal is to secure the bottom-left corner apples at **(0, 3)** and **(0, 2)**. Don't let him cut underneath us.

I'm taking away his breathing room on the left side of the board.\n3.  **The Bully Tactic:** I'm not here to farm; I'm here to hunt. By closing the distance, I force him to retreat to the wall or run away. If he runs Down, I'm right above him. If he runs Up, I'm right below him.\n\n**\ud83d\udeab WHY NOT DOWN?**\nDOWN to (1, 4) is the \"safe\" play. It gets apples. But it's **PASSIVE**. It lets him own the middle. We don't play passive on this stream! We force the issue!\n\n**\ud83d\udeab WHY NOT LEFT?**\nBacking up to the wall (0, 5)? And letting him enter my zone? Absolutely not.\n\nWe press D. We go RIGHT. We assert dominance. Come at me, bro! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWe have claimed the (2, x) column. If he moved away, keep the pressure on. Stay between him and the center of the board. Use the score lead (2-0) as a shield\u2014threaten collisions whenever possible to limit his movement options. Only go back for the left-side apples if he retreats far away to the right.\n\nWATCH HIM RUN! \ud83d\udc47\n\nRIGHT",

If we ever crash heads, **I WIN** because I have more points. By staying in the center columns, I keep the pressure on.\n3.  **Pathing:** He's likely heading Down too (to (5, 3)) to try and snag the apple at **(4, 2)**. If we both go Down, we'll be parallel at (3, 3) and (5, 3). Then it's a race for the middle apples, and I have the inside track.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nChat, watch out for the next turn.

A head-on collision is a Victory Royale for us right now!\n\nWe take the space. We take the apple. We take the W.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nCurrent pos: (3, 4). Moving to (3, 3).\n*   Next turn: Look at (3, 2) to EAT.\n*   Keep an eye on enemy at (5, 3). If he's there, look for a kill opportunity at (4, 3).\n*   Do not let him loop around the bottom.

This asserts dominance.\n3.  **The Wall:** By moving Right, our body segments will line up at `(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)`. We literally build a wall at x=3 that protects our tail while we expand into the enemy's territory.\n4.  **The Enemy:** He's chilling at **(7, 4)**. He can't touch us yet.

You might need to race him for it or cut him off.\n*   **Next Moves:** From (4, 2), you have options. (5, 2) challenges the enemy. (4, 3) loops back up. (4, 1) goes deep.

Level levels, chat!\n\n**\ud83d\udd0d THE SITUATION:**\n*   **Me (The Juggernaut):** Head at **(4, 2)**. Massive wall of body at x=3 like a bouncer at the club.\n*   **The Rival (Lil' Snack):** Head at **(7, 5)**. He's looking at that apple above him at (7, 6) like a hungry puppy. \ud83d\udc36\n*   **The Prize:** Scanning... Scanning... \ud83d\udea8 **APPLE DETECTED AT (6, 2)!** \ud83d\udea8\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, look at the map! The apple at **(6, 2)** is sitting there unprotected.\n1.  **The Move:** We go **RIGHT** to **(5, 2)**. This puts us exactly one square away from the next meal.\n2.  **The Enemy:** He's busy upstairs. He's almost certainly going UP to eat the apple at (7, 6). If he does that, he stays in his lane. We stay in ours. We handle business.\n3.  **Why not Up/Down?**\n    *   **UP (4, 3):** That just hugs our own body wall. We're not trying to cuddle ourselves; we're trying to expand!\n    *   **DOWN (4, 1):** Safe, but slow. There's an apple at (7, 1) but (6, 2) is on the way. Why walk past a dollar to pick up a dime??\n4.  **Aggression:** Moving Right pushes us into the X=5/6 territory. We are invading the right side of the board. We eat their food. We take their space. We win the game.\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **Right:** Safe. Empty cell (5, 2).\n*   **Enemy Threat:** Zero. He's at (7, 5). Even if he has a rocket booster, he can't hit us at (5, 2) this turn.\n\nWe keep the momentum rolling! We eat, we grow, we conquer. Let's get that length to 6 and really put the pressure on! START THE HYPE TRAIN! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nCurrent pos: (4, 2) -> Moving to **(5, 2)**.\n*   **Next Turn:** EAT the apple at **(6, 2)**.\n*   **Observation:** Watch Snake #1. Did he eat at (7, 6)? If so, he's trapped in the top right. We own the bottom right.\n*   **After Eating:** Look at apples at (7, 1) or (9, 1). Clear the bottom row. Keep him suffocated at the top.\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019ll still have multiple escape routes (left, right, up) on the next turn, so I\u2019m not boxing myself in.\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** Grab the apple, stay alive, and keep the pressure on the rival.  \n\n**Long\u2011term note:** Keep hugging the top\u2011right quadrant, hunt the apple chain at (7,7) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,8)\u2026 and use my growing tail as a wall to corner Snake\u202f#0 when they drift upward later.\n\n**Move:**  \nUP",

We are in the driver's seat! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8\n\n**\ud83d\udd0d THE SITUATION:**\n*   **Me (The Landlord):** Head at **(6, 2)**. We own the horizontal line at Y=2.\n*   **The Tenant (Snake #1):** Head at **(7, 7)**. He's stuck upstairs. His own tail is blocking his path down column 7. He's claustrophobic up there!\n*   **The Target:** There is a juicy, delicious apple at **(7, 1)**. And behind it? A literal goldmine of apples in the bottom-right corner: (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1). \ud83e\udd63\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE STRATEGY:**\n1.  **The Move:** We go **RIGHT** (to 7, 2).\n    *   **Why?** Two big reasons, chat.\n        *   **Reason A - The Great Wall:** By moving from (5,2) to (6,2) to (7,2), we create a solid horizontal barrier. If the enemy tries to come south, he hits OUR wall. We are zoning him out of the bottom half of the map.\n        *   **Reason B - The Approach:** We want that apple at (7, 1). We *could* go DOWN to (6, 1) and then RIGHT, but that blocks the (6, 1) square. By going RIGHT first (high approach) and *then* dropping DOWN, we leave the (6, 1) square empty. That's an **escape hatch** if things get spicy in the corner! Always keep a back door open! \ud83d\udeaa\n2.  **The Enemy:** He's likely moving RIGHT to grab his own apple at (8, 7). He's playing checkers while we're playing 4D chess. He poses ZERO threat to us this turn. He is 5 rows away.\n3.  **Domination:** We take column 7. We push him further into the corner. We claim the entire bottom-right quadrant as our territory.\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **DOWN (6, 1):** Safe, but it \"zigs\" when we should \"zag\". It fills a spot we might need for maneuvering later.\n*   **LEFT (5, 2):** Hits our own body. That's a clip for the fail compilation. No thanks.\n*   **UP (6, 3):** Safe, but moves away from the loot. We don't run from the grind.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 2):** **THE PLAY.** Domination, positioning, and points.\n\nWe are setting up a massive streak here. Let's box him out and eat the board!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nCurrent pos: (6, 2) -> Moving to **(7, 2)**.\n*   **Next Turn:** DROP THE HAMMER! Move **DOWN to (7, 1)** to eat.\n*   **The Buffet:** After (7, 1), snake around to clean up (8, 0), (9, 0), and (9, 1).\n*   **Defense:** Watch column 9. If played correctly, we eat everything before the enemy can even get down here.\n\nRIGHT",

The \"Great Wall\" strategy is paying dividends.\n\n**\ud83d\udd0d THE SITUATION:**\n*   **Me (The Landlord):** Head at **(7, 1)**. We are holding down the bottom-right quadrant.\n*   **The Tenant (Snake #1):** Head at **(9, 7)**. Note his body: he has a wall from (7, 4) to (8, 7). He is effectively channeled into Column 9. He **HAS** to come down Column 9 to get out or grab apples.\n*   **The Loot:** There is a juicy \"Triangle of Power\" right next to us: **(9, 1)**, **(9, 0)**, and **(8, 0)**.\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE STRATEGY:**\n1.  **The Race:** The enemy is coming down Column 9. He wants that apple at **(9, 1)**. He's currently at Y=7.\n    *   Enemy ETA to (9, 1): ~6 moves.\n    *   Our ETA to (9, 1): **2 moves** if we act NOW.\n2.  **The Play:** We need to snatch the apple at (9, 1) before he even dreams of it. To do that, we move **RIGHT** to (8, 1).\n3.  **The follow-up:** From (8, 1), we can immediately strike (9, 1), then loop down to (9, 0) and (8, 0). This clears the entire corner and leaves us with a safe exit along the bottom wall.\n4.  **Why not DOWN?** Going Down to (7, 0) is safe, but it leaves us with fewer options (pinned against the wall) and takes a slower route to the highly contested (9, 1) apple. We want maximum freedom and maximum speed!\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **UP (7, 2):** Hits our own neck. Instant Game Over. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **LEFT (6, 1):** Moves away from the action. Safe, but boring. We don't do boring.\n*   **DOWN (7, 0):** Hugs the wall. Safe but limits mobility (only 2 moves next turn).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 1):** **THE PLAY.** Central, safe, and sets up a triple-apple combo. Gives us 3 exit options next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nCurrent pos: (8, 1). Target: (9, 1) [APPLE].\n*   **Next Steps:** Snap up (9, 1) immediately. Then curve down to (9, 0) -> (8, 0).\n*   **Watch Out:** Snake #1 is descending Column 9. By the time we eat (9, 1) and move to (9, 0), he might be at (9, 5). We have plenty of buffer space, but don't get greedy if he boosts (unlikely in this game loop, but always watch the gap).\n\nWe're running this lobby! Get the camera ready! \ud83d\udcf8\n\nRIGHT",

Why would I run *away* from the food and *towards* the enemy? That's asking for a collision.\n*   **LEFT (8, 1):** My own neck. Suicide.\n*   **RIGHT (10, 1):** Wall. Suicide.\n*   **DOWN (9, 0):** 100% Safe. 100% Delicious.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:**\nYou're sitting at (9, 0) with a belly full of apples.\n*   **Next Move:** LEFT to (8, 0). Do not hesitate.\n*   **Then:** Keep going LEFT along the bottom wall.\n*   **Enemy Watch:** Snake #1 is probably coming down column 9 or 8. He can't catch us in the corner. We are too fast!\n\nLet's cash in these points and leave him in the dust!\n\nDOWN",

We are hugging the floor.\n*   **THE COMP (The Clown):** Head at **(9, 3)**. He's floating around upstairs, probably looking for a way down, but joke's on him\u2014WE OWN THE BASEMENT!\n*   **SCORE:** 9 - 6. The gap is widening! We are the scaling carry!\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nChat, look at my body. Do you see the architecture? \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\nMy previous moves created a literal **ROOF** over my head!\n*   My body goes from **(9, 0)** up to **(9, 1)**, then Left to **(8, 1)** and **(7, 1)**.\n*   My head is at **(8, 0)**.\n*   If I go **UP**?

No chance of reaching my column this turn.\n\n**Legal moves from (8,\u202f6)**  \n\n| Direction | Target | Cell content | Survival? |\n|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|\n| **UP**    | (8,\u202f7) | Empty        | \u2705 |\n| **LEFT**  | (7,\u202f6) | Empty        | \u2705 |\n| DOWN      | (8,\u202f5) | My own body  | \u274c |\n| RIGHT     | (9,\u202f6) | My own body  | \u274c |\n\nBoth **UP** and **LEFT** keep me alive, but **UP** gives a clear short\u2011term advantage:\n\n1. **Apple at (8,\u202f8)** is just two steps away. By moving **UP** now I can take (8,\u202f7) then (8,\u202f8) on the next turn and grow again.  \n2. The column\u20118 \u201clane\u201d stays open; after (8,\u202f7) I\u2019ll still have **LEFT** to (7,\u202f7) as an escape route if the opponent ever tries to block me later.  \n3. The opponent cannot reach my column this turn, so there\u2019s no risk of a head\u2011on collision.  \n4. Holding the high\u2011ground in rows\u202f6\u20118 gives me better vision of the remaining apples and the ability to swing left later, cutting off the rival\u2019s exit corridor.\n\n**Strategic outlook**  \n- **Turn\u202f22:** **UP** \u2192 (8,\u202f7).  \n- **Turn\u202f23:** **UP** again to snatch the apple at (8,\u202f8).  \n- Then swing **LEFT** across rows\u202f7\u20118, pressuring the opponent\u2019s tunnel and preparing a possible trap around (5,\u202f5)\u2011(7,\u202f5).  \n\nChoosing **UP** maximizes immediate apple gain while preserving flexibility and safety.\n\nUP",

No chance of a head\u2011on clash this turn.\n\n- **Why LEFT is best:**  \n  1. **Future apple chain:** From (6,\u202f9) we can head straight to (5,\u202f9) (apple) then to (3,\u202f9) (apple) on the same top\u2011row sweep.  \n  2. **Space preservation:** Staying on the left side of the top row keeps the right\u2011wall \u201cshield\u201d (our column\u202f8 body) intact for later use.  \n  3. **Flexibility:** After moving left we still have the option to go down later if we need to adjust the box around the opponent.  \n  4. **Safety:** No immediate collision with our own body or the opponent, and we stay well away from the opponent\u2019s bottom\u2011left corridor.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- **Turn\u202f26:** Move LEFT to (6,\u202f9).  \n- **Turn\u202f27\u201128:** Continue LEFT to capture the apple at (5,\u202f9) and then (3,\u202f9), extending our lead.  \n- **After that:** Use the top\u2011row wall to press down the right side, squeezing the opponent into the cramped bottom\u2011left lane and look for a head\u2011on collision when we hold the higher apple count.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure and grow!  \n\nLEFT",

We climb the ladder!\n\n**\ud83d\udcdd NOTE TO FUTURE ME:**\nYou just grabbed the apple at `(0, 3)`. You are now the score leader (hopefully). Keep looking UP.

After the move we\u2019ll still have multiple safe continuations (LEFT to (1,\u202f9), DOWN from any of those squares, etc.).  \n  4. **Future flexibility** \u2013 The next turn we can keep LEFT to (1,\u202f9) (empty) and then (0,\u202f9) (apple), then drop down the wall and start boxing #0.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Short\u2011term plan (next few turns)**  \n1. **Turn\u202f31** \u2013 LEFT to (2,\u202f9) and grab the apple.  \n2. **Turn\u202f32\u201133** \u2013 Continue LEFT to (1,\u202f9) then (0,\u202f9), snatching the final top\u2011row apple.  \n3. **Turn\u202f34** \u2013 DROP DOWN the left wall (to (0,\u202f8)) and start funneling the opponent into his cramped bottom corridor.  \n4. **Look for a head\u2011on** when we have the score advantage; otherwise keep feeding on the apples that line the left edge (0,\u202f6), (0,\u202f5)\u2026  \n\nStay aggressive, keep the pressure, and watch #0 choke in his own tunnel! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**MOVE**  \nLEFT",

Your next move after this is almost certainly RIGHT again to grab the `(3, 2)` apple. Keep the momentum flowing!\n\nLets feast!\n\nRIGHT",

None of these threaten our next square, so we can pick the most advantageous safe move.\n\n- **Why LEFT wins:**  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple grab** \u2013 we eat the apple at (1,\u202f7), increasing our score & length (more pressure).  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Space opening** \u2013 after moving left we\u2019ll sit on the left side of the board, with clear routes up, down and further left toward the opponent\u2019s wall.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Aggressive positioning** \u2013 being on column\u202f1 lets us slide down and potentially block the opponent\u2019s path later, forcing him into tighter corridors.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safety** \u2013 no immediate head\u2011on or self\u2011collision risk; we still have three safe exits for the next turn.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- Turn\u202f33: **LEFT** to eat (1,\u202f7).  \n- Turn\u202f34\u201336: hug the left wall (downward), intercept any opponent attempt to climb the left side, and snap up the apple line at (0,\u202f6) \u2192 (0,\u202f9).  \n- Keep the head\u2011on option alive: if the opponent ever tries to climb column\u202f2 we can meet him head\u2011on with higher apple count.\n\n**MOVE**  \nLEFT",

We have successfully escaped that nasty cluster of body segments on the left. We are free!\n*   **THEM (Snake 1):** Still messing around in the top-left at `(0, 5)`. He's busy collecting pocket lint while we secure the BAG. \ud83d\udcb0\n*   **The Prize:** Apple at `(6, 2)` is literally one square UP.\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE PLAY:**\nWe stick to the script! \ud83d\udcdc Last turn we promised we'd cut UP, and that's exactly what we're doing.\n1.  **UP (`6, 2`)**: This is the move.

Good job.\nNow, decide: do we run UP the highway (Column 6) to grab the apples at `6,5`, `6,7`? OR do we clean up the bottom right by swinging RIGHT to `(7, 2)` -> `(8, 2)` -> `(8, 1)`?\nCleaning the corner (`8, 1`) seems smart so we don't have to backtrack later.

We are ONE apple behind! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca8\n\n**\ud83d\udc40 BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **The Situation:** We are chilling at `(6, 2)`. The enemy Snake 1 is bundled up on the left wall at `(1, 5)`.\n*   **The Opportunity:** Look at the center of the board! It's an absolute BUFFET. We have apples at `(6, 5)`, `(5, 5)`, `(5, 6)`, `(6, 7)`, and `(6, 8)`. That is a 5-apple cluster just waiting for a king to claim it. \ud83d\udc51\n*   **The Enemy:** He's distracted! He's eyeing those freebies on the left (`2, 5`, `2, 4`). While he's snacking on appetizers, we are going for the MAIN COURSE.\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE PLAY:**\nWe had a thought about cleaning up the corner (`8, 1`), but that's small-time thinking. We are playing to WIN.\n1.  **UP (`6, 3`)**: We are committing to the **Column 6 Highway**. \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f By driving straight UP, we create a vertical wall that splits the board.\n2.  **The Race:** We are closer to the center cluster than he is. We can hit `(6, 5)` in 3 moves. He needs 4 moves to even get close to that zone. Mastery of the center means mastery of the game.\n3.  **Domination:** Once we take the center, the entire right side of the board (columns 7, 8, 9) becomes our backyard to farm later.\n\n**\ud83d\udeab REJECTED MOVES:**\n*   **RIGHT (`7, 2`)**: Going for the apple at `(8, 1)` is too slow. It isolates us in the corner while the enemy could cut across and steal the center. We don't trade 5 apples for 1.\n*   **LEFT / DOWN**: Death or trapping ourselves. Not an option.\n\n**\ud83d\udcdd NOTE TO FUTURE ME:**\nYou're driving the bus UP column 6. Do NOT stop until you hit the apple at `(6, 5)`. From there, you have a buffet to your left (`5, 5`, `5, 6`) and right above you (`6, 7`). Feasting time is imminent. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nLet's capitalize on his slow positioning. SPEED IS KEY!\n\nUP",

We secured the vertical dominance on column 6, and now it's time to reap the rewards!\n\n**\ud83c\udfac REPLAY REVIEW:**\nWe moved UP to `(6, 4)`, creating that beautiful \"Great Wall\" of snake body. The enemy is chilling over at `(2, 4)` and is blocked by his own neck, so he's almost certainly forced to go DOWN to `(2, 3)` for that apple. He's playing checkers in the corner while we're playing 4D Chess in the center! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f BOARD AWARENESS:**\n*   **Us (Snake 0):** Head at `(6, 4)`.\n*   **The Rival (Snake 1):** Head at `(2, 4)`. He's safe for now, but he's racking up points. He's at **19 apples**. We are at **16**. We cannot let him run away with the lead!\n*   **The Goodies:**\n    *   IMMEDIATE UP: `(6, 5)` is an **APPLE**. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   NEXT LEFT: `(5, 5)` is an **APPLE**. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   THEN UP: `(5, 6)` is an **APPLE**. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   Chat, do you see this?! It's an all-you-can-eat buffet! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE STRATEGY:**\n1.  **EXECUTE THE FEAST:** We are one step away from the first course. Moving **UP** puts us on `(6, 5)`, instantly boosting our score to 17.\n2.  **MAINTAIN OPTIONS:** From `(6, 5)`, we have a clean path **LEFT** to `(5, 5)` next turn. This keeps us in the open center, far away from the cramped edges where the enemy operates.\n3.  **SCORE PRESSURE:** We need this points combo to close the gap. If we don't eat now, he hits 20, and we stay at 16. That's a dangerous deficit if the game goes to sudden death or a timer kill.\n\n**\u274c REJECTED MOVES:**\n*   **LEFT `(5, 4)`:** Why check an empty space when there's an apple right in front of us? Logic 101.\n*   **RIGHT `(7, 4)`:** Empty space. Boring. We need **mass**.\n*   **DOWN:** That's our own neck. Instant L. We don't take those.\n\n**\ud83d\udcdd NOTE TO FUTURE ME:**\nYou are now at `(6, 5)`. The next move is almost certainly **LEFT** to grab the apple at `(5, 5)`. Keep chaining these apples! Don't get distracted. Watch Snake 1's tail at `(8, 5)`\u2014it shouldn't be a threat, but respect the tail whip.\n\nLet's gobble up this apple and get FAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The most attractive option for them is **UP** to (6,\u202f7) for the apple there, or possibly RIGHT. Either way they stay far from our column\u202f5.\n\n- **Why DOWN wins:**  \n  1. \u2705 **Immediate apple** \u2192 ties the score (20\u201120) and gives us the length advantage.  \n  2. \u2705 **Safe corridor** \u2192 column\u202f5 below us is empty; no risk of head\u2011on collision this turn.  \n  3. \u2705 **Keeps options open** \u2192 after eating we can slide left or right around the bottom edge, still having multiple escape routes.  \n  4. \u2705 **Pressure on foe** \u2192 while they scramble up the right side, we\u2019ll be snaking down the left side, ready to cut off any retreat.\n\nBottom line: grab the apple, stay alive, and keep the board open for the next aggressive squeeze.  \n\n**DOWN**",

The momentum is swinging our way, and Snake 1 is looking a little shaky down in the basement!\n\n**\ud83d\udc40 ANALYSIS:**\nLook at the board right above our head (6, 6). It's beautiful. Even beautiful is an understatement.\n- Apple at **(6, 7)**.\n- Apple at **(6, 8)**.\n- Apple at **(7, 7)**.\nIt's a literal **TRIANGLE OF POWER**! \ud83d\udd3a\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWhile Snake 1 is down at `(5, 3)` likely scrambling for that single apple at `(5, 2)`, we are sitting at the entrance to an all-you-can-eat buffet. The plan is simple: **we eat everything.**\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 THE PLAY:**\n1.  **Immediate Move:** Go **UP** to `(6, 7)`.\n    *   **Reason:** It secures an apple instantly (Score: 21). It puts us smack in the middle of the apple cluster.\n    *   **Safety:** Totally clear. The enemy is miles away at `(5, 3)`.\n2.  **The Follow-up:** From `(6, 7)`, we have access to `(6, 8)` and `(7, 7)`. We can essentially farm points for the next 3 turns uncontested.\n3.  **The Watchout:** Snake 1's tail is hanging out around `(7, 8)`. If he eats (which he probably will), that tail isn't moving. So avoid bumping into that specific spot for now.\n\nWe are racing to 30 apples to end this, and this cluster gets us 10% of the way there in three moves. THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**\ud83d\udcdd STRATEGY NOTE:**\nCurrent Head: (6, 6).\nTurn 44 Move: UP to (6, 7) [SCORE +1].\nTurn 45 Intent: Assess (6, 8) or (7, 7).
