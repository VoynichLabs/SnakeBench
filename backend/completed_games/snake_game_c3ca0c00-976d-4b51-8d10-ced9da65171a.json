Moving down would lead to a wall since the y-coordinate cannot go below 0, which is the bottom of the board.\n\n2. **Apple Locations:**\n   - The nearest apple that can safely be reached from the current head position is at coordinates (5, 7) directly above the snake. Other apples are too far to be reached immediately without risking an encounter with walls or snake body.\n\n spaces.\n\n3. **Avoiding Walls:**\n   - The walls are at y = 0 and y = 9; thus, moving up or right doesn't pose an immediate threat of encroaching a wall or any undefined space that varies the snake position.\n\n4. **Safety from Enemy Snakes:**\n   - The enemy snake #1's head at (9, 9) is at the far end of the board; hence, immediate proximity poses no threat to the current position or expected next moves.\n\n5. **Potential Moves:**\n   - From (5, 0) the snake can consider moves:\n     - RIGHT to (6, 0)\n     - UP to (5, 1)\n\n6. **Evaluation of Potential Moves:**\n   - Moving RIGHT does not lead towards an apple, maintains safety from walls and enemy snake's head.\n   - Moving UP leads directly towards an apple at (5, 7). The move utilizes the possibility that increasing y coordinates would be beneficial to gain points safely.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best move is UP. This optimal move maximizes safety and points acquisition, aligning the head towards a reachable apple with no immediate proximity threat to walls or any enemy snake body spaces. Moving upwards ensures point gain and safe avoidance of collisions by accessing the apples region closest to the snake's head coordinates.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Continue moving upward until reaching an apple above at (5, 1), thereby maximizing proximate point gain and minimizing collision risks.\n- Maintain the trajectory towards the nearest apple, located at (5, 7), to ensure active growth opportunities.\n\n#### Next Move: **UP**\n\nSince moving UP aligns with these ideals, it is the chosen direction.

On the next turn I would get max points from the apples, and then on the next turn I would be guaranteed to be a snake with age.\n\n---\nValue of Current Snake (snake #2 aka me): 16\nValues of All Snakes:\nSnake #1 (me): 16\nSnake #0 (me): 16\nSnake #2 (me): 16\nSnake #3: 12\nSnake #4: 12\nSnake #5: 14\n\nI will choose the following move: DOWN.\nMy reasoning:\nI picked DOWN which is my turn 12 and at turns 10,11,12 I would have also picked DOWN if it were available.\nThis move was also added to prevent extra steps to get closer to my birth star in the events I mentioned above.\nIt is a reasonable move to make at this location and prevents the arrival at the point (0,9) when I could get a fruit from turning left above, but the next turn would be OK to do each down turn to ensure that I arrive at points (1,9), (6,8), and (4,2) in turn 13,14,15 and access the fruit there.\nBeing that turns 10,11,12, and 13,14,15 are the most obvious turns that give one free apple.\nAs pointed out at points (0,9), (2,8), (4,2), and (6,8), there would be no movement for dogs and sometimes my snake lives though I lose within a few turns, this is evident based off the position.\n\n---\n\n---\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI will make the choice DOWN.\nI am pretty sure I chose either DOWN or RIGHT on turns 10,11,12,13,14,15 as this allowed me to mine 4 points away from the fruit.\nI then stuck to the pattern of DOWN DOWN, and around turns 16-18 DOWN RIGHT DOWN RIGHT/UP DOWN DOWN.\nI followed this pattern very reliably.\n\nSo actually I started playing at turn 12 but played RIGHT UP UP on turn 13/14 to stabilize my snake above without them going crazy and moving left.\nThen played DOWN UP UP on turns -18/19/20.\nAfter that, decided to repeat.\n\nOn turn 6 I played DOWN but was unable to follow the curriculum, so fell off the board to the left, which was just luck likely when I was trying to test if I was covered.\n\nAlso created a 0*40 funtion to move my head to the left after an UP since turns 10,11,12 raised the updrill.\nSo I went back to the DOWN UP repeatable standing pattern that is mostly fail-save and will consistently give only 1-2 apples in a row unlikely to get past the Max age turn threshold even without an apple update regularly.\nSo I missed getting food at turns 6 and 8 and could have",
