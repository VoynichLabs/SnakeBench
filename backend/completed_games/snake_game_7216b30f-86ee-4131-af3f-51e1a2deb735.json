We could go there on the following move, yet then we might face constrictions if we get too close to enemy territory.\n\u2013 UP to (3,8): This move remains in the open space above us.

Additionally, the upward direction keeps us distant from enemy cells as we plan our next steps.\n\nTherefore, my chosen next move is: UP."
