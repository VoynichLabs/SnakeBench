Moving LEFT gets me closer to it while maintaining safety.

Moving RIGHT would take me away from all apples. Moving UP doesn't immediately advance toward any apple either.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away and poses no immediate threat. My priority should be efficient apple collection while maintaining maneuverability.\n\n**Path analysis to nearest apple (5,5):**\n- LEFT 3 moves gets me there\n- UP then LEFT then LEFT gets me to (7,6) - still 2 moves from apple\n- RIGHT takes me away from all apples\n\n**Decision:** LEFT is the clear choice - it's safe and moves me directly toward the closest apple at (5,5).\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Move LEFT to (7,5). Next turn, I'll be 2 moves from the (5,5) apple. The enemy is at (2,7) and moving away from me, so I have priority on the (5,5) apple. I should continue LEFT next turn to maintain momentum toward that apple. Be careful to avoid getting trapped near the enemy snake's territory.\n\nLEFT",
