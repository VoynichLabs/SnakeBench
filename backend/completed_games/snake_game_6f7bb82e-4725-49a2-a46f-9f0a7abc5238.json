Both snakes are just heads right now - he's at (7,1) and I'm at (2,7). We're on opposite corners of this 10x10 battlefield, and we both got 0 apples so far. Time to change THAT!\n\n**Looking at my options from (2,7):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,8) - Clear, but not much around\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) - Also empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) - This is LOOKING good\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) - Has that apple at (4,7), but...\n\n**The plays here:** I see a CLUSTER of apples in the upper-left corner! We got (1,9), (0,8), (0,6), and (1,6) all huddled together. Meanwhile, the enemy is chilling in the bottom-right corner with apples like (8,2), (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,7), I'm setting myself up to feast on that apple cluster AND maintain maximum escape routes. From (1,7), I can go UP to (1,8), LEFT to (0,7), DOWN to (1,6) for an immediate apple, or even back RIGHT if things get spicy.\n\nThe enemy's gonna be making moves too - if he's trying to push toward me, I want to be in control of this upper-left quadrant. Being aggressive doesn't mean being reckless, chat! It means playing smart and boxing him in strategically.\n\n**My move:** LEFT to (1,7) - positioning myself in that apple-rich zone and keeping my options OPEN for maximum domination! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Who's ready to see a domination play? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick read: My head = (7,1). Enemy head = (2,7). Scores tied 0-0. Board around me is clear \u2014 no body segments blocking anything. Turn 0, so no prior traps.\n\nConsider all 4 moves:\n- UP -> (7,2): SAFE. Moves me closer vertically toward the opponent, keeps 3 open follow-up options (L/R/U), not on an immediate edge. Good for aggression and future mobility.\n- DOWN -> (7,0): SAFE but moves onto the bottom edge (y=0). Fewer future vertical options, more constraining. Not ideal unless we bait.\n- LEFT -> (6,1): SAFE and central. Keeps options, reduces x-distance to enemy a bit. Solid, but less direct on the y-axis.\n- RIGHT -> (8,1): SAFE but edges me toward x=9 soon \u2014 slightly more constrained than staying centered.\n\nEliminations: none of these immediately kill me. But DOWN and RIGHT shrink escape options next turn (edges). No head-on risk this turn \u2014 opponent is far away (Manhattan 11) and unlikely to contest my immediate cell.\n\nDecision: Pick the move that is aggressive (reduce distance to enemy), preserves options, and avoids edges. UP is the best balance \u2014 closes on the opponent while keeping multiple safe follow-ups and access to open space.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (so we remember on Replay): advance north and center myself around x\u22486\u20137 while monitoring opponent movement. If they push south recklessly, force a head-on only if my apple lead is higher. Otherwise, use lateral spacing to corral them toward the edges and cut off escape routes. Grow selectively to lock territory.\n\nUP",

Distance is big (Manhattan 11) \u2014 no immediate head-on risk.\n- No bodies on board to worry about, so no instant collisions.\n- Apples are everywhere up-top left, but we prioritize corralling the enemy, not immediate fruit-chasing.\n\nConsider moves:\n- UP -> (7,3): SAFE. Moves me north toward them, keeps lots of escape routes (L/R/U/D), stays off edges. Good for aggression + mobility.\n- DOWN -> (7,1): SAFE. Back toward my previous cell; allowed with no body, but moves me away from opponent and toward bottom edge \u2014 less aggressive.\n- LEFT -> (6,2): SAFE. Reduces x-distance directly, very useful for an eventual box-in sweep.\n- RIGHT -> (8,2): SAFE. Pushes toward edge (x=9 soon), more constraining. Not ideal.\n\nEliminations: none of the four are fatal now. But we want the move that both closes on the foe and keeps many follow-ups. UP and LEFT both give equal Manhattan reduction (to 10). UP keeps better vertical options and fits last-turn plan; LEFT is more direct horizontally. I'll stay consistent and keep central while moving north to pressure them.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Continue north/center (around x=6\u20137) to reduce their safe zone. Monitor their moves \u2014 if they commit south or toward edges, pivot left to cut off escape.\n- Grow selectively: take apples only when they help seal the box or give a scoring lead. If I obtain a clear apple lead, force a head-on clash to finish them.\n- Avoid hugging the right/bottom edges. Keep 2\u20133 open moves available so I don't get boxed by their counters.\n\nWe go up the board and make them sweat. You ready? Let's trap 'em. \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

From there I could go UP again to eat it, or reposition. Solid play, keeps me near the apple cluster and maintains escape routes. Defensive and safe.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (0,7)**\n*WATCH OUT CHAT!* This is RISKY. Going LEFT puts me at (0,7), and I'm surrounded by apples at (0,6), (0,8), AND (1,6). Moving DOWN from (0,7) would crash me into (0,6) with an apple. Moving LEFT again would be off-board. This is a BOXING-IN scenario waiting to happen! If I take this apple and grow, I might trap myself in the corner. NOT WORTH IT.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (2,7)**\nSMAAAHT! This is looking GOOOD. From (2,7), I keep my escape options WIDE open. I can go UP to (2,8), RIGHT to (3,7), DOWN to (2,6), or LEFT back to (1,7). This moves me slightly toward center while staying near my apple-rich zone. Plus I'm MAINTAINING DISTANCE from the enemy who's on the other side of the board. This gives me maximum flexibility for the next 5-6 turns while I figure out my approach.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN \u2192 (1,6)**\nHas an apple at (1,6), so I'd grow immediately. But this is ALSO in that tight apple cluster corner. After eating, I'd be stuck at (1,6) with limited moves and apples all around me. Short-term gain, long-term TRAP. Nah, we ain't about that life!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\nThe enemy is making his way toward that bottom-right apple cluster (8,2), (9,4), etc. Meanwhile, I'm in prime position in the upper-left with apples at (1,9), (0,8), (0,6), (1,6), (4,7), (2,5), and (1,1) all nearby.\n\nI want to:\n1. NOT get trapped in corners (looking at you, LEFT and DOWN options!)\n2. Maintain maximum escape routes so I can be AGGRESSIVE later\n3. Stay aware of where that enemy head is so I can box him in\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nRIGHT to (2,7) keeps me flexible, moves me toward center where I have more room to maneuver, and sets me up to either push toward the enemy OR continue dominating this upper quadrant. I'm keeping my options OPEN like a true strategist!\n\nLet's GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Good for pressuring from the right flank.\n- LEFT -> (6,3): SAFE. Cuts horizontal gap (Manhattan 8), also solid \u2014 more direct approach.\n- DOWN -> (7,2): SAFE but retreats, increases distance. Not aggressive.\n- RIGHT -> (8,3): SAFE but edges us toward the board side, shrinking options.\n\nWhy UP? We want to close the vertical gap toward their Y while maintaining lateral freedom to swing left later and pinch them. UP preserves room above and to both sides, avoids hugging the right edge, and fits the current plan to pressure from high-right and then collapse inward.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pushing north into their hemisphere (UP, UP or UP then LEFT depending on their moves).\n- If they drift toward the edge, pivot left to cut off escape and force a trap.\n- Only grab apples that help seal the box or give us a lead; once we have an apple advantage, bait a head-on if safe.\n\nWe go loud, we go smart, we trap 'em.

Let me scope out the battlefield and figure out my next power move!\n\n**My current situation:**\n- I'm sitting pretty at (2,7) in the upper-mid area\n- Enemy is posted up at (7,3) - still no body, just a head like me\n- Both of us at 0 apples, looking to CHANGE that ASAP!\n- The board is PACKED with apples everywhere, so we gotta be strategic about which ones we chase\n\n**Analyzing my options from (2,7):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2,8)**\nThis is TOTALLY valid - on board, safe, and (1,9) is still within reach. From there I could go LEFT to grab that apple or position for other moves. Solid defensive play, keeps me in the upper quadrant.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 **RIGHT \u2192 (3,7)**\nNOW WE'RE TALKING! This is looking DELICIOUS! From (3,7), I'm:\n- One step closer to center (3,7) which gives me MAXIMUM mobility\n- Still within striking distance of apples at (4,7), (2,5), and (3,2)\n- Moving toward the enemy WITHOUT being reckless - I'm PRESSURING his space\n- MAINTAINING all my escape routes - UP to (3,8), RIGHT to (4,7), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT back to (2,7)\n- Setting up to potentially cut off his escape routes if he tries to push toward my territory\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (1,7)**\nThis would backtrack me to where I just was. Not necessarily BAD, but it's not aggressive. I'd be giving up the ground I just gained and letting the enemy control more center space. We can do BETTER than this!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN \u2192 (2,6)**\nHas an apple at (2,5) nearby, so this is an option. But going DOWN gets me closer to that lower-mid area where I might get squeezed between the enemy's position and the board edge. Not the safest long-term play.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\nThe enemy is at (7,3) and I'm at (2,7). The middle of the board (around coordinates 4-6) is where the REAL fighting will happen. By moving RIGHT to (3,7), I'm:\n1. Taking CONTROL of more territory\n2. Moving toward the CENTER where I have more room to maneuver\n3. Getting CLOSER to the enemy's potential escape routes\n4. Keeping multiple paths open for the next 5-6 turns\n\nI want to eventually BOX this guy in and force him to crash into ME or himself. Moving RIGHT sets up that pressure while keeping me flexible. I'm not rushing into a head-on collision since we're tied 0-0 - but I WANT to be the one who forces that collision when I have the advantage!\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nRIGHT to (3,7) is the PLAY! I'm taking territory, maintaining mobility, and setting up the pressure plays for later turns. Let's GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Because scores are tied, we avoid deliberately walking into a simultaneous-head cell. UP keeps two solid follow-ups available (LEFT to pressure their y=5 corridor, or UP to threaten their tail area), so we preserve escape options while compressing their space toward the top/left.\n- LEFT is tempting for direct lateral pressure, but UP is a better \u201csqueeze\u201d \u2014 it corrals them toward the wall and their tail at (3,6), setting up future forced choices. DOWN is too passive; we want control.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP now to slide under their tail and limit their northern escape.\n- If they flee left/down, pivot LEFT to cut them off; if they go up/stay, continue pressing UP to trap them against the top wall.\n- Keep at least two escape options each turn; don\u2019t bait a head-on while tied.

We've got apples at (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,8), (1,1), (1,6), (1,9), (2,5), (3,2), (6,1), (7,6), (8,2), (8,4), (9,3), (9,4) - it's a smorgasbord out here! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (2,6):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2,7)** - Let me check... yep, that's OPEN! No apple, but plenty of space!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2,5)** - OHHHH there's an APPLE at (2,5)! And looking at my body at (3,6), this direction is SAFE!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1,6)** - Another APPLE! And this keeps me pushing toward that SWEET left-side apple cluster!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)** - NOPE! That's my own body! INSTANT DEATH! Never even consider this again! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nAlright chat, here's where it gets JUICY! The enemy is at (3,4) with body at (4,4). If I go RIGHT, I literally hit myself and die. If I go UP to (2,7), I gain height but move away from the apple clusters. If I go DOWN to (2,5), I grab an apple AND maintain my LEFTWARD territorial pressure!\n\nBut wait... let me think about where the enemy is LIKELY to move. They're at (3,4). If they move LEFT to (2,4), they come closer to my zone. If they move DOWN to (3,3), they go lower. If they move UP to (3,5), they actually get CLOSER to my head!\n\nHere's the KEY insight: The enemy CAN'T move RIGHT to (4,4) because that's their OWN body! They're somewhat boxed in on their right side.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nI see TWO killer options here:\n\n**DOWN to (2,5)** - Grab that apple at (2,5), increase my score to 2-1, and put IMMEDIATE pressure on the enemy! If I get that second apple, I force THEM to make mistakes trying to catch up!\n\n**LEFT to (1,6)** - Grab the apple at (1,6), score goes to 2-1, AND I continue my leftward expansion toward that MASSIVE apple cluster at (0,6), (0,8), (1,9), (0,3), (0,4)!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nBOTH options are FIRE! But I'm leaning STRONGLY toward DOWN to (2,5) because:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE SCORE ADVANTAGE** - Going 2-1 puts the enemy in CATCH-UP mode! They're stressed, I'm chilling! \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n2. **POSITIONAL CONTROL** - Moving DOWN to (2,5) keeps me at y=5, which is a GREAT middle-ground position! I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from there!\n3. **ENEMY MANIPULATION** - If I'm at (2,5) and the enemy is at (3,4), I have so many options to pressure them! They have to respect my position!\n4. **LONG-TERM THREAT** - From (2,5), I can continue down to (2,4), (2,3), or go left toward that beautiful apple cluster! So many possibilities!\n\nThe LEFT move to (1,6) is ALSO great, but DOWN gives me that IMMEDIATE score lead which is HUGE in this tied game! I want to force the enemy to play PERFECT while I play AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\nIf I grab that apple at (2,5), my plan is:\n1. **Continue territorial expansion** - Keep pushing toward those apple clusters!\n2. **Maintain score pressure** - Every apple = more stress for the enemy!\n3. **Position for the KILL** - If the enemy makes ONE mistake, I capitalize HARD!\n4. **Avoid getting boxed** - Keep those movement options OPEN!\n\nThe enemy is stuck on the right side with limited mobility, and I'm FREE to roam the LEFT side like I OWN IT! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nDOWN to (2,5) - GRAB that apple, go 2-1 UP, and let the enemy feel the PRESSURE! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nLet's get this BREADDDDDD!\n\nDOWN",

Grabbed that apple at (2,5), went UP 2-1 in the scoreboard, and now we're in PRIME position to CRUSH this enemy! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n**CURRENT BATTLEFIELD:**\n- My head: (2, 5) - MEATLOCKER MODE ENGAGED! \ud83d\udcaa\n- My body: [(2, 6), (3, 6)] - solid two-segment tail, ready to grow! \ud83d\udcc8\n- Enemy head: (4, 5) - RIGHT IN FRONT OF US! \ud83d\ude24\n- Enemy body: [(3, 5)] - only one segment, this rookie is TINY! \ud83d\udc76\n- SCORE: 2-1 LEAD - We're UP, they're PRESSURED! Let's keep it that way! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE NASTY SITUATION:**\n\nAlright chat, here's the JUICY part - we're at (2, 5) and the enemy is at (4, 5). We're basically FACE TO FACE with only one cell between us! \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Enemy body at (3, 5) is RIGHT BETWEEN US!\n- If I move RIGHT to (3, 5), that's the ENEMY BODY - DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- If I move UP to (2, 6), that's MY OWN BODY - DOUBLE DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nSo RIGHT and UP are COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE! No exceptions, no debates, we're NOT throwing this game!\n\n**MY SURVIVAL OPTIONS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 5)** - This is WIDE OPEN! No apples, but plenty of space to maneuver! Takes us away from immediate confrontation while maintaining our LEFTWARD territorial pressure! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 4)** - Also CLEAR! Opens up the lower board and lets us access that apple at (3, 2) if we want to get AGGRESSIVE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE STRATEGIC CALCULATION:**\n\nHere's where game sense comes in, chat! The enemy is stuck at (4, 5) with body at (3, 5). They're basically TRAPPED on the right side with limited mobility!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 5):\n- I push further into our LEFT TERRITORY\n- I maintain score pressure (2-1 lead)\n- I keep multiple escape routes open\n- I force the enemy to either come at me or play it safe\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 4):\n- I go LOWER on the board\n- I get closer to that apple at (3, 2)\n- I maintain pressure but sacrifice some territorial control\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nI'm going with **LEFT to (1, 5)** and here's WHY:\n\n1. **TERRITORIAL DOMINANCE** - Moving LEFT pushes us deeper into our controlled zone! The left side of the board is OURS! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (1, 5), I can continue LEFT to (0, 5), go DOWN to (1, 4), or UP to (1, 6)! SO many choices! \ud83d\udd13\n\n3. **SCORE PRESSURE** - We're already up 2-1, no need to rush! Play smart, play calculated, make them CRACK! \ud83e\udde0\n\n4. **ENEMY PUNISHMENT** - Every move we make LEFT pushes the enemy further into their corner! They're gonna feel BOXED IN soon! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\nFrom that LEFT position, my game plan is:\n1. **Continue expansion** - Push toward that apple cluster at (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6)!\n2. **Maintain lead** - Keep the pressure on, force them to make mistakes!\n3. **Position for the KILL** - When they slip up, we STRIKE! \ud83d\udca5\n4. **Stay mobile** - Keep those options OPEN, NEVER get trapped! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe enemy is in a TIGHT spot with limited mobility, and we're FREE to roam like the PREDATORS we are! Let's feast on those apples and leave them in the dust! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nLEFT to (1, 5) - Push the advantage, maintain territorial control, and make them feel the HEAT! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\u2728\n\nLet's get this BREADDDDDD!\n\nLEFT",

All three are on-board and not occupied by enemy bodies right now.\n- Opponent head = (1,5) with body at (2,5) and (2,6). Their legal moves from (1,5) are UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5). They cannot reach our immediate next cells this turn, so no immediate head-on risk on any legal choice.\n- Score check: We\u2019re behind 1\u20132. We should be aggressive but NOT force a head-on. Avoid speculative collisions \u2014 we want positional dominance to trap them later.\n\nWhy UP (4,6)?\n- It pushes us toward their northern flank and threatens to cut off the UP escape (they can go to 1,6). From (4,6) we can pivot LEFT next turn into (3,6) to press on their neck area (while still avoiding direct collisions). That\u2019s pressure without gambling on a head swap.\n- Keeps multiple escape options (RIGHT, UP, LEFT available next turn) so we don\u2019t get boxed in \u2014 preserves mobility while closing the noose.\n- RIGHT (5,5) is safe but drifts away from the fight; DOWN (4,4) could also work to pressure south, but UP better threatens to limit their vertical movement and sets up a flank.\n- We\u2019re not chasing apples recklessly \u2014 we\u2019re positioning to corral and force them into cramped choices. If they blunder and head-on, great; but we\u2019ll only commit if we\u2019re ahead on apples or it\u2019s a guaranteed kill.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP now to (4,6). Then pivot LEFT toward (3,6) to threaten their neck/body at (2,6)/(2,5).\n- Maintain at least two escape directions each turn; bait them toward the wall/into narrow corridors and then close the gap.\n- If they move into a trap or we gain an apple lead, tighten the head-on pressure; otherwise keep circling and shrinking their available space.\n\nAlright fans \u2014 keep the energy, we\u2019re hunting.

We've got THREE safe options, but which one CRUSHES the enemy the hardest?!\n\n**UP to (1, 6)** is looking TASTY for multiple reasons:\n1. \ud83c\udf4e **FREE APPLE!** We're hungry and that apple is calling our name!\n2. \ud83d\udcc8 **GROWTH** - More body = more territory = more DOMINANCE!\n3. \ud83c\udfaf **POSITIONING** - We push UP into the upper board, forcing the enemy to respect our vertical presence!\n4. \ud83d\udd13 **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (1, 6), we can go UP to (1, 7), LEFT to (0, 6), or even DOWN back to (1, 5)! We're FLEXIBLE!\n5. \ud83c\udfc6 **SCORE PRESSURE** - Push that lead to 3-1 and make them play catch-up!\n\nThe enemy is trapped on the right side with body at (3, 5) - they're basically stuck between us and the wall! If we move UP and grab that apple, we:\n- Expand our TERRITORY\n- Increase our lead\n- Keep all our escape routes OPEN\n- Stay MOBILE and unpredictable\n\n**THE LONG-TERM GAME:**\n\nFrom that UP position, our game plan is:\n1. \ud83c\udfaf **Collect more apples** - Keep growing, keep scoring!\n2. \ud83d\udce6 **Box them in** - They're already cornered, make it WORSE!\n3. \ud83d\udca5 **Force the mistake** - When they slip up, we STRIKE!\n4. \ud83c\udfc3 **Stay mobile** - NEVER get trapped, always have options!\n\nThe enemy only has ONE body segment compared to our TWO - they're VULNERABLE! We can literally make them crash into us or force them into a corner!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nWe're going **UP to (1, 6)** and here's the BREAKDOWN:\n\n\u2705 **Safe move** - No collisions, no self-hits!\n\u2705 **Apple +1** - Free point, free growth!\n\u2705 **Territorial dominance** - Push up, show authority!\n\u2705 **Multiple exits** - Stay flexible, stay deadly!\n\u2705 **Score pressure** - 3-1 is even BETTER than 2-1!\n\nThat apple at (1, 6) is basically asking to be eaten! It's sitting there, ripe for the taking, and we're in PRIME position to grab it! \n\nLet's get this BREADDDDD and leave them in the DUST! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nUP to (1, 6) - Grab the apple, grow the body, extend the lead, DOMINATE THE BOARD! \ud83d\udcaa\u2728\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

They cannot move RIGHT or DOWN (both occupied by their body).\n- Apples and walls are not the focus \u2014 we want to corral and avoid a risky head-on since they have more apples (we're trailing 1\u20133).\n\nCheck all moves (safety + follow-ups):\n- DOWN -> (4,5): illegal (backwards into our own body). X\n- LEFT -> (3,6): immediately safe. From (3,6) our follow-ups would be UP (3,7) or DOWN (3,5) \u2014 LEFT to (2,6) is currently occupied by their body (dangerous if we try to push into it soon). Good aggression but slightly narrows options.\n- RIGHT -> (5,6): immediately safe and keeps lots of space to pivot (UP/RIGHT/DOWN next turn). Moves us away from the fight, less aggressive but preserves mobility.\n- UP -> (4,7): immediately safe. From (4,7) we retain at least two strong follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/UP) and can pivot to pressure their northern escape without forcing a head-on collision. Keeps us central and flexible.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- We are behind on apples, so we should NOT chase a guaranteed head-on. Force them into tighter space gradually instead.\n- LEFT gets us closer and is more aggressive, but it also moves us adjacent to their body cluster where a misstep could trap us.\n- RIGHT is safe but drifts away from the target; fans want aggression.\n- UP is the sweet spot: presses north toward their flank, preserves multiple escape routes, and keeps options open to pivot left later to squeeze them \u2014 without committing to a risky head-on while trailing.\n\nShort-term plan for future-self:\n- Move UP now to maintain flexibility and pressure the top corridor.\n- Next turns, pivot left when it's safe to start hemming them toward the left wall (watch their move to 0,6 vs 1,7). Only force head-on if we have apple advantage or a guaranteed kill.\n- Keep at least two escape directions each turn; avoid stepping into cells currently occupied by their body unless it's a guaranteed trap.\n\nAlright \u2014 let\u2019s keep the pressure and not get greedy.

Let's assess this SITUATION!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (1, 6) - looking good fam! \u2728\n- My body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)] - tight formation! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy head: (4, 6) - right there on my RIGHT! \ud83d\ude24\n- Enemy body: [(4, 5)] - tiny rookie with ONE segment! \ud83d\udc76\n- Score: 3-1 DOMINATING - we're up by 2, stay COMPOSED! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**GAME BOARD VISUALIZATION:**\nLooking at row 6: A 1 T . 0 . . A . .\n- I'm at (1, 6) with the '1'\n- Enemy is at (4, 6) with the '0'\n- My body is at (2, 6) and (2, 5) and (1, 5)\n- Enemy body is at (4, 5)\n\n**CRITICAL MOVEMENT OPTIONS - SAFETY FIRST:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (0, 6)** - Clean path! No obstacles! Fresh territory! \ud83d\udc40\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6)** - BLOCKED! That's MY OWN BODY at (2, 6)! \ud83d\udc80 We would COLLAPSE - NEVER throw the game like that!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (1, 7)** - Wide open! No threats detected! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (1, 5)** - WAIT... that's my body segment at (1, 5)! So that's hitting myself! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD MOVE!

The enemy can't come from our left, so we only have to worry about RIGHT, UP, and DOWN!\n\n2. \ud83d\udccf **DISTANCE CREATION** - We put MORE space between us and the enemy! From (0, 6), we're 4 cells away from their head at (4, 6) instead of just 3 cells at (1, 6)!\n\n3. \ud83c\udfaf **FORCE THEIR MOVEMENT** - If we're at the edge, the enemy has to make decisions about approaching us, giving US the tactical advantage!\n\n4. \ud83d\udd13 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (0, 6), we can:\n   - Go UP to (0, 7) - explore upper left\n   - Go DOWN to (0, 5) - head toward potential apples at (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8)!\n   - Go RIGHT back toward center when we want!\n\n5. \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE ACCESS** - There are apples at (0, 8), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 3) in that left column! We're positioning ourselves to claim that territory!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nOur game plan from this LEFT edge position:\n1. \ud83c\udfaf **Control the left side** - Own that apple-rich column!\n2. \ud83d\udce6 **Keep pressure on** - The enemy is trapped on the right side anyway!\n3. \ud83d\udca5 **Wait for their mistake** - With only 1 body segment, they're VULNERABLE!\n4. \ud83c\udfc3 **Stay mobile** - Keep options open, don't get cornered ourselves!\n5. \ud83c\udfc6 **Extend the lead** - Those apples at (0, 8), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 3) are CALLING our name!\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nLEFT to (0, 6) - Claim the edge, control the left column, force them to play OUR game! \ud83d\udcaa\u2728\ud83d\udc0d\n\nThis move keeps us SAFE, POSITIONS us for apple domination, and maintains our AGGRESSIVE yet calculated approach!

DEAD MOVE!\n\nSo we're down to UP or DOWN - both SAFE, both VIABLE!\n\n**STRATEGIC SHOWDOWN: UP vs DOWN! \u2694\ufe0f**\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n**UP to (0, 7) pros:**\n- Fresh territory at the top-left corner \u2713\n- Can see the full board from above \u2713\n- Apple at (0, 8) is ONE MOVE AWAY! \ud83d\udcb0\n- Enemy would be BELOW us \u2713\n\n**DOWN to (0, 5) pros:**\n- APPLE DENSITY EXPLOSION below! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- (0, 4) has an apple - 1 move away! \ud83d\udcb0\n- (0, 3) has an apple - 2 moves away! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n- (0, 8) still accessible - we're still on the edge! \u2713\n- More CONTROL over the left column! \u2713\n- Forces enemy to respect our LEFT side territory! \u2713\n\n**THE ENEMY SITUATION:**\nThe rookie at (4, 7) with just 1 body segment is VULNERABLE! They've got:\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) probably open\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) probably open  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) that's THEIR OWN BODY - DEAD move!\n- UP \u2192 (4, 8) probably open\n\nThey're not cornered YET, but we're BOXING them in strategically!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE APPLE DOMINATION PLAN:**\n\nFrom the LEFT EDGE, our game plan should be:\n1. \ud83c\udf33 **CONTROL THE LEFT COLUMN** - Those apples at (0, 8), (0, 4), (0, 3) are OURS for the taking!\n2. \ud83d\udce6 **KEEP PRESSURE** - The enemy is trapped on the right anyway!\n3. \ud83d\udca5 **WAIT FOR MISTAKE** - With only 1 body segment, they're one bad move from disaster!\n4. \ud83c\udfc3 **STAY MOBILE** - Keep options open, don't get boxed in ourselves!\n5. \ud83c\udfc6 **EXTEND THE LEAD** - We're up 4-1, let's make it 7-1 or BETTER!\n\n**THE VERDICT - GOING DOWN! \u2b07\ufe0f**\n\nI'm choosing **DOWN to (0, 5)** and here's the HEAVY reasoning:\n\n1. \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE HIGHWAY** - The left column from (0, 3) to (0, 8) is RIDDLED with apples! We're positioning ourselves to CHAIN those apple moves and extend our lead even FURTHER! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. \ud83c\udfaf **IMMEDIATE CONTENT** - From (0, 5), we can go DOWN to (0, 4) and GRAB that apple INSTANTLY! That's +1 point RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udd25\n\n3. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **DEFENSIVE EDGE** - Being at the edge still gives us that NATURAL BARRIER! The enemy can't come from our left, so we only worry about RIGHT, UP, and DOWN - but we're controlling the LEFT column completely!\n\n4. \ud83d\udd13 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (0, 5), we can:\n   - Go DOWN to (0, 4) \u2192 grab apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Go DOWN to (0, 3) \u2192 grab another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n   - Go UP to (0, 6) \u2192 back to center edge\n   - Go UP to (0, 7) \u2192 explore above\n   - Go RIGHT to (1, 5) \u2192 when we're ready to expand!\n\n5. \ud83d\udcca **SCORE PRESSURE** - We're up 4-1. Every apple we grab puts more distance between us! The enemy only has 1 apple - we need to make sure that stays the FINAL SCORE! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:**\n\nFor the next few turns, our strategy is CLEAR:\n1. **Turn 11 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 5) - secure position\n2. **Turn 12:** DOWN to (0, 4) - grab that apple! \ud83d\udcb0\n3. **Turn 13:** DOWN to (0, 3) - grab ANOTHER apple! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n4. **Turn 14:** Assess - either continue down or swing back up toward (0, 8)!\n5. **Continuous:** Keep the enemy cornered, wait for them to slip up, then FORCE that head-on collision if they get brave!\n\n**THE CALL:**\n\nDOWN to (0, 5) - Claim that apple-rich territory, extend our lead to 5-1, and show them why you don't mess with the SNAKE AT THE EDGE! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nThis move is AGGRESSIVE, CALCULATED, and puts us in position to DOMINATE the rest of this game! We're up 4-1, we're in CONTROL, and we're about to MAKE IT RAIN APPLES! \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\n\nLET'S GOOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nDOWN",

Their forced/likely move is DOWN to (0,4) to eat the apple at (0,4). So they\u2019re moving away along the left wall and will GROW if they take that apple. No immediate head-on threat to us this tick.\n\nTactical reasoning \u2014 why LEFT?\n- Grabbing (2,7) gives us growth and more board presence to start hemming them in later. We\u2019re behind on apples, so we need to grow to dominate space and set up a trap. Growth = power. \ud83d\udcaa\n- LEFT keeps multiple escape options next turn (we still can go UP or DOWN from (2,7)), while also nudging our body toward their flank. We avoid a risky head-on because we\u2019re currently down on apples \u2014 no need to mutually assured destruction yet.\n- UP or DOWN are safe but passive; LEFT is aggressive and aligns with the boxing strategy. Are we ready to squeeze? You know we are. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (notes to future self \u2014 read on the clip next turn):\n- Eat (2,7) to grow. Then shadow the left corridor, move to control x=1/x=2 columns and push them closer to the wall. Force them to pick apples that make them longer in cramped space, then cut off escape lanes when you can guarantee you win a head-on or they run into your body.\n- Avoid initiating a head-on until we either have apple parity or can guarantee they\u2019ll die.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and keep pressure.

They're at (2, 7), we're at (1, 4) - we're CREEPING UP on them! \ud83d\udd77\ufe0f\n\n2. \ud83d\udd12 **STARTING THE BOX-IN** - From (1, 4), we can:\n   - Continue RIGHT to (2, 4) next turn!\n   - Start CLIMBING UP the board!\n   - Cut off their escape routes!\n   - Force them into a corner!\n\n3. \ud83d\udccd **BOARD CONTROL** - The enemy is trying to move LEFT toward us, but we're moving RIGHT toward them! We're going to MEET in the middle and when we do... \ud83d\udca5 HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n\n4. \ud83d\ude24 **FORCE THE CONFRONTATION** - With a 5-2 lead, we WANT that head-on collision! They crash into us = THEY die, WE win! This is PURE SKILL! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcaa\n\n5. \ud83d\udd2e **LONG-TERM DOMINATION** - Going down just gives us more apples but lets the enemy breathe. Going RIGHT puts the SQUEEZE on them! They're on the RIGHT edge of the board with body trailing behind - we're about to BOX THEM IN like animals! \ud83d\udce6\u26d3\ufe0f\n\n**THE BOXING STRATEGY - PHASE 1:**\n\nMy plan for the next several turns:\n1. **Turn 13 (NOW):** RIGHT to (1, 4) - Start the pressure!\n2. **Turn 14:** RIGHT to (2, 4) - Push deeper into their zone!\n3. **Turn 15:** UP to (2, 5) or (2, 6) - Start cutting off their space!\n4. **Continuous:** Force them toward the wall, wait for them to have NO moves, then FORCE that head-on collision!\n\n**WHY NOT DOWN TO (0, 3)?**\n\nDon't get me wrong, (0, 3) has an apple and it's SAFE - but is it STRATEGIC? \ud83e\udd14\n\n- Going down just lets us collect more apples on the left\n- The enemy is already moving toward us\n- We're already winning 5-2\n- We need to CLOSE THIS OUT not just extend our lead!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nRIGHT to (1, 4) - We're putting the PRESSURE on, starting the box-in, and setting up that DOMINANT HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nThis is PURE SKILL, PURE STRATEGY, PURE CONTENT!

X\n- UP -> (2,8) = safe, but gives fewer follow-ups (backwards blocked next turn).\n- DOWN -> (2,6) = safe now, but the cell below that is (2,5) which is the opponent\u2019s tail \u2014 they\u2019re likely to hold that cell (they\u2019ll probably eat down to (0,3) and GROW) so moving toward that column risks getting trapped against their body soon. Risky.\n- LEFT -> (1,7) = safe, aggressive, preserves multiple exits next turn (UP/DOWN/LEFT), and starts cutting off their horizontal escape.\n\nEnemy pulse check \u2014 Opp head (0,4) with body occupying (0,5),(0,6),(1,6),(1,5),(2,5). They\u2019re hugging the left wall and very likely to go DOWN to grab (0,3) (apple) and GROW, which will keep (2,5) occupied. They can\u2019t go UP or LEFT, so they have limited wiggle room. No immediate head-on threat this turn.\n\nWhy LEFT? Simple:\n- It\u2019s the most aggressive safe move that increases our control of x=1/x=2 columns and gives us 3 clean follow-ups (1,8),(1,6),(0,7).\n- UP gives fewer follow-ups next turn (only 2) and makes us easier to trap.\n- DOWN funnels us toward their tail/tight space and could play into their length advantage if they grow \u2014 don\u2019t hand them the kill zone.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pressure on columns x=1\u20132, shadow the left corridor and starve them of lateral escape.\n- Avoid head-on until we either match apples or can guarantee they run into our body. If they overcommit down the wall and grow, we\u2019ll cut off x=0/x=1 when we can force them into a collision or trap.\n- Prioritize staying between them and the center, keep multiple escape options open so we can pivot to box them when they\u2019re forced into a dead-end.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 aggressive but smart.

Keeps some space but no immediate apple; moving there still has only ~2 safe follow-ups (cannot go down into my tail at 2,7).\n- UP -> (1,9) apple. Safe, grows me to close the gap, and from (1,9) I have two clean exits (LEFT or RIGHT) next turn \u2014 preserves options and avoids risky wall-hugging. Best blend of safety + aggression given we\u2019re behind on apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (1,9) to get to 3 apples and keep lateral mobility.\n- If opponent drifts up/left toward the same corridor, avoid head-on; instead rotate around them and only commit to a box when I have head parity or a guaranteed crash on their side.\n- Prefer to build length then squeeze \u2014 don\u2019t get pinned on x=0 while they already control the wall.\n\nFinal call \u2014 safe apple grab, keep options open:\n\nUP",

Tightens my corridor. \ud83e\udd0f\n- RIGHT to (3,9): legal, keeps me on the top row with good lateral space to pivot down later. More room to maneuver and cut off columns when I\u2019m ready. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nEnemy check: opponent head at (4,4) with 5 apples vs my 3 \u2014 they\u2019re ahead, so DO NOT force a head-on. They\u2019re far away this turn anyway, so focus on space control and growth to flip the score advantage later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Expand right along the top row to keep maximum options open.\n- Then peel down the board centrally to threaten lanes and box the enemy when I have enough length.\n- Avoid any head-on until I\u2019m ahead in apples or can guarantee mutual kill in my favor.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 keep options open, stay aggressive but not suicidal.\n\nRIGHT",

UP -> (3,10) is off-board = insta-death. LEFT -> (2,9) is my neck = insta-death. So those two are out.\n- Remaining safe choices: RIGHT -> (4,9) or DOWN -> (3,8). Neither hits the enemy body (they\u2019re around y=4), so both are alive moves.\n\nMove-space breakdown:\n- RIGHT to (4,9): keeps me on the top row, preserves lateral sweep options, and fits the last-turn plan of expanding right across the top. From (4,9) next turn my legal follow-ups would be RIGHT (5,9) or DOWN (4,8) \u2014 two clean options. Good for controlling the high ground and setting up a later vertical peel to box lanes.\n- DOWN to (3,8): gives me three immediate escape options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) \u2014 slightly more local flexibility. But it pulls me off the top row into the middle sooner and could shorten my ability to sweep later. It also edges me toward my own body column at x=1 over time.\n\nOpponent check and win-risk:\n- Opponent head is at (5,4) with 5 apples vs our 3. They\u2019re ahead \u2014 we should NOT force a head-on. They\u2019re far away right now, so avoid suicidal baits. Sticking to the top row keeps distance and lets us grow and control space before committing to a confrontation.\n\nStrategy note / short-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Keep expanding right along the top row for 2\u20134 turns to maximize lateral control and keep the enemy isolated below. Then peel down centrally (once longer) to threaten lanes and cut off escape routes when we have length advantage.\n- Avoid any head-on until we can guarantee it favors us (either more apples or a mutual-kill that gives us the higher score).\n- Stay aware of tail movement so we don\u2019t trap ourselves when we eventually turn down.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 keep options open, control the high ground, and bait them into my box later.

Safe!\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6) and enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7):\n- I'd be at (6, 6), they'd be at (4, 7)\n- No collision! Safe!\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6) and enemy moves LEFT to (3, 8):\n- I'd be at (6, 6), they'd be at (3, 8)\n- No collision! Safe!\n\nActually, wait. Let me check UP more carefully...\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 7):\n- Enemy at (4, 8) could move RIGHT to (5, 8)\n- I'd be at (5, 7), they'd be at (5, 8)\n- They'd be RIGHT ABOVE me!\n\nBut could they move into me? From (5, 8) to (5, 7)? That would be DOWN, which would hit my head!\n\nBut they wouldn't do that voluntarily... unless they had no other choice.\n\nLet me think about future moves and board control...\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're leading 5-3! We need to:\n1. Keep growing to dominate the board\n2. Force the enemy into bad positions\n3. Set up potential head-on collisions if we can\n4. Avoid getting trapped\n\nThe apple at (6, 6) is RIGHT THERE! We should eat it!\n\nBut let me reconsider UP to (5, 7)...\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 7):\n- I go further into the upper board\n- I can potentially cut off the enemy's escape\n- The enemy at (4, 8) might feel pressured to move away\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n- I eat the apple and grow\n- I extend toward the right side\n- I maintain my position away from direct confrontation\n\nBoth seem reasonable, but let me think about the board layout more...\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 8). If I move UP to (5, 7), I'm moving closer to them. If I move RIGHT to (6, 6), I'm moving away.\n\nGiven that we want to BOX THEM IN and dominate, maybe I should move UP to apply pressure?\n\nBut wait... the last move rationale said I should go UP, and now I'm reconsidering...\n\nActually, let me look at this from a different angle.\n\n**APPLE ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe apple drops include:\n- (8, 2), (9, 4), (0, 8), (9, 3), (0, 3), (8, 4), (1, 1), (7, 6), (3, 2), (6, 1), (4, 0), (6, 2), (3, 1), (9, 1), (6, 4)\n\nI can see apples at:\n- (6, 6) - RIGHT next to me!\n- (7, 6) - Nearby!\n- (6, 4) - Below and right of me!\n\nThe apple at (6, 6) is RIGHT THERE! We should take it!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nLet me think about what's most important:\n1. Staying alive \u2713\n2. Growing to dominate \u2713  \n3. Pressuring the enemy \u2713\n4. Keeping options open \u2713\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6):\n- I eat the apple and grow to 6 segments\n- I extend toward the right side\n- I'm still in a good position\n- Low collision risk\n- I grow, which is good for dominating\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 7):\n- I move further up\n- I don't eat this turn\n- I might pressure the enemy more\n- But I'm not growing\n\nGiven that we want to GROW AS A MEANS OF DOMINATING, and the apple is RIGHT THERE, I think RIGHT to (6, 6) is the play!\n\n**COLLISION CHECK ONE MORE TIME:**\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6) and enemy at (4, 8) moves RIGHT to (5, 8):\n- I'd be at (6, 6), they'd be at (5, 8)\n- No collision!

NAH.\n- RIGHT = (5,7): legal, but sits us directly above x=5 where the enemy has body at (5,6). Only 2 safe follow-ups (UP, RIGHT) because DOWN would be into their body at (5,6). That creates pressure but also a tighter lane and a larger risk of being baited into a head-on later \u2014 and THEY have more apples. Don\u2019t tempt fate.\n- DOWN = (4,6): legal. Follow-ups (excluding back) are LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) (occupied by enemy), and DOWN (4,5) \u2192 effectively only 2 safe exits. It brings us closer vertically to the enemy\u2019s zone and cuts our flexibility.\n- LEFT = (3,7): legal and the cleanest. After LEFT our options (excluding back) are UP (3,8), LEFT (2,7), DOWN (3,6) \u2014 three roomy follow-ups, keeps escape routes open, lets us start sweeping horizontally to hem them without offering an easy head-on bait. Win condition: stay alive, build position, force them into tighter corridors.\n\nShort-term tactic & long-term plan:\n- Don\u2019t chase apples blindly \u2014 pressure their space and reduce their mobility. We\u2019re down on apples (3 vs 5), so avoid head-on collisions unless we tie apples or force them into a death.\n- Move LEFT to keep multiple follow-ups and start sweeping across y=7. If they push right/up toward (6,7)/(7,6) to chase apples, cut off their retreat angle by sliding left/down next turns to funnel them into the x\u22482\u20135 corridor. If they retreat, rotate and maintain pressure while picking safe apples only when it doesn\u2019t sacrifice escape routes.\n- Keep watching (5,6) \u2014 it\u2019s a blockade. Use it to our advantage by controlling the space above it rather than attacking straight into it.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 let\u2019s make the move and keep the choke tight.\n\nLEFT",

We want to reduce their mobility and avoid getting funneled into the area around (5,6).\n- LEFT starts a sweep across y=7, keeps multiple escape routes open, and positions us to rotate down-left to box them later. DOWN is tempting for an apple and pressure, but it drags us closer to their zone and could shorten our options if they counter-press. UP is too restrictive.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n- Move LEFT now to preserve freedom.\n- React to their choice: if they creep right/up toward the open space, rotate down to cut retreat; if they back away, keep sweeping left and force them into the x\u22482\u20135 corridor, then tighten with vertical pressure.\n- Only force a head-on if we\u2019ve got the apple advantage or a clear trap \u2014 otherwise we bait and box.\n\nLET\u2019S GOO \u2014 making the safe, flexible, aggressive play.

Can't move into myself!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (8, 6)** - Empty! \u2705\n- Moves toward the RIGHT side of the board\n- Opens up the CENTER and LEFT for future moves\n- Great positioning to pressure the enemy\n- Multiple escape routes available\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (7, 7)** - Empty! \u2705\n- Moves UP into open space\n- Toward the TOP edge\n- Also keeps options open\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **DOWN \u2192 (7, 5)** - Empty! \u2705\n- Moves back DOWN toward my body\n- More CONFINED position though\n- Would trap me near my own body\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nEnemy at (3, 7) with body at [(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)]:\n- UP to (3, 8)? Empty!\n- LEFT to (2, 7)? Empty!\n- DOWN to (3, 6)? Empty!\n- RIGHT to (4, 7)? BLOCKED by their own body!\n\nThe enemy is STUCK in the top-left corner! They can only go UP, LEFT, or DOWN! This is PERFECT for us! We can keep pressuring and eventually force them into a bad position or even a head-on collision!\n\n**STRATEGIC POSITIONING CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nRIGHT to (8, 6) is the move for several reasons:\n\n1. **BOARD DOMINATION** - Moving RIGHT takes us toward the CENTER-RIGHT, which is WIDE OPEN! This gives us more control over the board and better angles to cut off the enemy.\n\n2. **AVOID THE CLUSTER** - Our body is all on the LEFT side. Moving LEFT would run us into our own body. Moving UP keeps us near the enemy but gives us fewer options. Moving RIGHT opens everything up!\n\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (8, 6):\n   - We can go UP to (8, 7), RIGHT to (9, 6), or DOWN to (8, 5)\n   - All these moves keep us SAFE and in CONTROL\n   - We can always swing back LEFT later if needed\n\n4. **APPLE ACCESS** - There are apples at (8, 8), (8, 2), and (9, 1) on the RIGHT side! We're positioning ourselves to grab these later!\n\n5. **NO COLLISION RISK** - Enemy is at (3, 7), we're at (7, 6). Even if they move toward us, we have plenty of space. Moving RIGHT keeps us FAR from them!\n\n**COLLISION RISK CHECK:**\n\nIf enemy moves toward us and we move RIGHT to (8, 6):\n- Enemy at (3, 7) - they're on the OTHER SIDE of the board!\n- We're completely safe from head-on collision\n- We maintain our advantage of 6 segments vs their 3\n- We keep them trapped in their corner\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe want to:\n1. **CONTINUE GROWING** - Every apple we eat makes us longer and more dangerous\n2. **PRESSURE THE ENEMY** - Use our extra segments to box them in\n3. **FORCE A MISTAKE** - Make them crash into us or the walls\n4. **SET UP HEAD-ON** - If they're low and we're high, force the collision!\n\nWith a 6-3 lead and 6 segments vs 3, we're in the PERFECT position to dominate! The enemy is trapped and helpless while we're cruising around eating apples! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n\nRIGHT to (8, 6)! This move:\n\n\u2705 Keeps us SAFE from all collisions\n\u2705 Moves us toward OPEN SPACE and APPLE opportunities\n\u2705 Maintains our DOMINANT position on the board\n\u2705 Keeps multiple escape routes and future options open\n\u2705 Continues our AGGRESSIVE pressure on the enemy\n\nWe're up 3 apples, we're longer, and we're in complete control! Let's keep this momentum going and show them why we're the KING of the stream! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent head at (8,6) with neck at (7,6) \u2014 they cannot move LEFT. Their options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT; they\u2019re far from me this turn, so no immediate head-on threats.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning AGGRESSIVE:\n- We\u2019re down on apples (3 vs 6). We can\u2019t afford to be passive. We want to close the distance, pressure their corridor, and try to hem them into their own body.\n- Moving DOWN to (2,6) puts us on their row (y=6) faster, letting us pivot rightward next turns to threaten their left flank and limit their horizontal escape. It gives us multiple safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) while keeping options open to peel up if they try to trap us.\n- LEFT keeps sweeping at y=7 and preserves space, but it\u2019s a slower play \u2014 less immediate pressure. UP wastes tempo increasing y without immediate influence on their corridor.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to get onto y=6.\n- Next turn pivot RIGHT to approach toward x\u22484\u20135 to threaten cutting off their retreat into the center. Avoid forcing a head-on \u2014 we only commit to head-on if apples or position clearly favor us.\n- If they try to snake around us or bait, keep mobility priority: don\u2019t run into their body wall at x=5\u20137. Use lateral moves to box and shrink their free area, then force mistakes.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 keep it tight, keep it aggressive, bait \u2019em into us! \ud83c\udf4a\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

I can then move UP or DOWN along the edge, forcing the enemy to stay on their side!\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS** - There are apples at (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), and (8, 4) nearby!

The enemy is stuck on the left with nowhere to go while I'm collecting apples and growing STRONGER!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're up 6-3 with DOUBLE the segments! The game plan is CLEAR:\n\n1. **CONTROL THE BOARD** - Take strategic positions like the right edge\n2. **COLLECT APPLES** - Grind those nearby apples at columns 8-9\n3. **GROW STRONGER** - More segments = more control = more pressure\n4. **FORCE THE ENEMY INTO A CORNER** - Keep them trapped on the left\n5. **SET UP FOR THE WIN** - We're at turn 23, 150 max, plenty of time to DOMINATE!\n\n**WHY NOT UP OR DOWN?**\n\nUP to (8, 7) is okay but puts me in a more confined space near the top edge. DOWN to (8, 5) moves me back toward my own body cluster. RIGHT to (9, 6) takes the OPEN corner and gives me maximum control!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n\nRIGHT to (9, 6)! This move:\n\n\u2705 Takes STRATEGIC EDGE positioning\n\u2705 Opens up APPLE COLLECTION opportunities on the right side\n\u2705 Maintains COMPLETE SAFETY from the trapped enemy\n\u2705 Keeps MULTIPLE escape routes available\n\u2705 Shows DOMINANCE on the board\n\u2705 Sets up future AGGRESSIVE plays\n\nWe're up 3 apples, we're longer, and we're in COMPLETE CONTROL!

They're getting WORKED! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BOARD DOMINATION:**\n\nLooking at the board, I'm posted UP at the right edge (x=9), while that loser is stuck on the left side. The gap between us is HUGE - we're on completely different planets out here! Zero collision threat currently!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (9, 6):**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (8, 6)** - BLOCKED! My own body is there! INSTANT DEATH! Never even thinking about this one!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 6)** - OFF THE BOARD! That's just GIVING UP! Eliminate this immediately!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (9, 7)** - Empty! \u2705 Looking at row 7, it's clear! This is VIABLE!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (9, 5)** - Empty! \u2705 Also safe, but let me analyze...\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nMoving UP to (9, 7) is the SMART play for several reasons:\n\n1. **EDGE CONTROL** - I stay on the edge at the top-right corner, maintaining DOMINANCE over that sector of the board!\n\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (9, 7), I have MULTIPLE escape routes:\n   - LEFT to (8, 7) - moves toward the center\n   - DOWN to (9, 6) - back to my current spot\n   - UP to (9, 8) - even higher edge position\n   - I always have an OUT!\n\n3. **APPLE ACCESS** - There are apples at (9, 4), (9, 3), and (9, 1) in my column! By moving UP, I'm positioning myself to eventually come back DOWN and GRIND those apples in upcoming turns!\n\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE** - By taking the top-right position, I'm showing I'm UNAFRAID of any part of the board! The enemy is trapped on the left with nowhere to go!\n\n**WHY NOT DOWN?**\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) isn't BAD, but UP gives me better long-term positioning. If I go down now, I might eventually get boxed in near my own body at (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6). Staying UP keeps me in the open!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're at turn 24/150, leading 6-3 with DOUBLE the segments! The game plan is CLEAR:\n\n1. **MAINTAIN EDGE CONTROL** - Keep that corner position!\n2. **KEEP OPTIONS OPEN** - Never get trapped in dead-ends!\n3. **DOMINATE THE BOARD** - Show them we own the right side!\n4. **SET THE TRAP** - Eventually we can push toward them and force a collision!\n\n**COLLISION RISK:**\n\nEnemy is at (2, 6) with body [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)]. They're basically immobilized on the left side. No way they can reach me over here while I'm eating apples and growing STRONGER!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n\nUP to (9, 7)! This move:\n\n\u2705 Keeps me on the STRATEGIC EDGE\n\u2705 Maintains MULTIPLE escape routes for future turns\n\u2705 Opens up APPLE COLLECTION opportunities on column 9\n\u2705 Keeps COMPLETE SAFETY from the trapped enemy\n\u2705 Shows BOARD DOMINANCE from corner to corner\n\u2705 Sets up AGGRESSIVE plays for later in the game\n\nWe're up 3 apples, we're longer, and we're in COMPLETE CONTROL! Let me make this MOVE and show them why they're getting COOKED! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP!\n\nUP",

Time to close the gap and compress their horizontal corridor.\n\nQuick legal sweep from our head (2,6):\n- UP \u2192 (2,7) is our neck (backwards) \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 legal, gives lateral space but slower to threaten them.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 legal, keeps flexibility and access to apples at (3,5) next turn.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 legal and AGGRESSIVE \u2014 moves us toward the opponent\u2019s wall at x=5\u20138 on y=6.\n\nKey enemy read: Opponent head at (9,6) with neck at (8,6) \u2014 they CANNOT move LEFT. Their only legal non-suicidal moves this turn are UP or DOWN. That\u2019s huge leverage: they\u2019re locked to vertical choices, so we can approach along y=6 without fear of a head-on from the left. We can force them to react vertically while we gain ground horizontally.\n\nWhy RIGHT is the play:\n- It gains ground toward their body wall (x=5\u20138 at y=6) quickly, enabling us within a couple turns to threaten the corridor they use.\n- Keeps follow-ups that let us pivot DOWN later to cut off their vertical escape if they commit up/down. From (3,6) we can go to (4,6) or drop to (3,5) \u2014 still flexible and aggressive.\n- LEFT is too passive (wastes time), DOWN is reasonable but slower to apply pressure to their spine at y=6.\n- Head-on risk is negligible this turn because their leftwards move is illegal; we should only commit to head-on if apples or numbers clearly favor us \u2014 they don\u2019t.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to close from x=2 \u2192 x=3.\n- Next turn push to x=4 (and then x=5 if safe) to threaten the gap in front of their body. If they go DOWN, look to occupy the entry at y=5 to hem them in; if they go UP, mirror and try to force them toward the wall by controlling the nearest vertical doorway.\n- Maintain mobility priority: don\u2019t run into our own remaining body at y=7. If we start getting boxed, bail toward open space (down/left) rather than trading head-on unless we\u2019re sure we win the KO.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX HIM \u2014 close the distance, force vertical choices, then clamp. You ready? LET\u2019S GOOOOOO\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "AYYYY CHAT, WE BACK AND STILL DOMINATING! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let me analyze this current board state and figure out our next CLUTCH move!\n\n**STATUS CHECK - WHERE WE AT:**\n\n- My head: (9, 7) - Still holding down the RIGHT EDGE like a boss!\n- My body: [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)] - 6 segments STRONG!\n- Enemy head: (3, 6) - Still trapped on the LEFT with only 3 segments!\n- SCORE: 6-3 LEADING BY 3! They're getting WORKED! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS - WHAT'S HAPPENING:**\n\nLooking at the board, I'm still posted UP at the right edge (x=9), while that chump is stuck on the left side. We're completely separated - no collision threat currently!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (9, 7):**\n\nLet me check ALL four directions systematically:\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (8, 7)** - BLOCKED! My body segment at (8, 6) might be okay, but wait... let me check the board. Looking at row 7, columns 7-9... (8, 7) appears empty BUT if I move LEFT, I'll be getting closer to my own body. Actually, more importantly - from (8, 7), where could I go NEXT turn? Let me think ahead...\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 7)** - OFF THE BOARD! INSTANT DEATH! Never even considering this!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (9, 8)** - Empty! \u2705 Looking at row 8, it's CLEAR! This is VIABLE!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (9, 6)** - BLOCKED! That's where my own body currently is! Hitting yourself = DEATH! Eliminate this immediately!\n\n**WAIT - LET ME THINK ABOUT LEFT MORE CAREFULLY:**\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 7), that space IS empty. But then what? My body is at (8, 6) which is RIGHT BELOW (8, 7). So from (8, 7):\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 6) = HIT MY OWN BODY = DEATH\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7) = back where I started\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 7) wait no, I'm already at (8, 7)...\n\nFrom (8, 7):\n- UP \u2192 (8, 8) - Need to check if empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 7) - Need to check if empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 6) - MY BODY = DEATH\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 7) wait...\n\nActually let me be more careful. From (8, 7):\n- UP: (8, 8) - looking at the board, row 8 col 8 appears empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (7, 7) - row 7 col 7 appears empty \u2705\n- RIGHT: (8, 6) - That's my body segment! \u274c DEATH\n- DOWN: (8, 6) - That's ALSO my body segment! \u274c DEATH\n\nSo from (8, 7), I would have 2 safe moves (UP and LEFT), but I would be TRAPPED in a tighter space near my own body. This could be problematic long-term!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - WHY UP IS THE SMARTER PLAY:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP to (9, 8)** gives me:\n1. **CLEAR ESCAPE ROUTES** - From (9, 8), I can go UP to (9, 9) or LEFT to (8, 8), maintaining multiple options!\n2. **EDGE DOMINANCE** - I stay on the corner edge, controlling that strategic sector!\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - By staying vertical on column 9, I keep my body in a nice straight line that can expand downward later!\n4. **NO SELF-TRAPPING** - I avoid getting bunched up near my own body segments!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're at turn 25/150, leading 6-3 with DOUBLE the segments! The game plan remains CLEAR:\n\n1. **MAINTAIN EDGE CONTROL** - Keep that corner position and use the board edges as natural protection!\n2. **KEEP OPTIONS OPEN** - Never get trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends!\n3. **GROW STRONGER** - We're already double their length, let's extend that advantage!\n4. **SET THE EVENTUAL TRAP** - Later we can push leftward and force them into a collision!\n\n**COLLISION RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\nEnemy is at (3, 6) with body [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. They're basically immobilized on the left side with nowhere to go. I'm at (9, 7) on the complete opposite side of the board. We're not even in the same ZONE chat!\n\n**WHY NOT LEFT:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 7) isn't TERRIBLE, but it brings me closer to my own body and could eventually box me in. My body is currently in a nice vertical line at x=5-9, column 6 (mostly). If I start moving leftward now, I might get tangled up in my own segments!\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (9, 8)!\n\n\u2705 Keeps me on the STRATEGIC EDGE at the corner\n\u2705 Maintains MULTIPLE escape routes (UP to 9,9 or LEFT to 8,8)\n\u2705 Opens up APPLE COLLECTION opportunities in column 8 and 9\n\u2705 Keeps COMPLETE SAFETY from the trapped enemy\n\u2705 Avoids self-trapping near my own body\n\u2705 Sets up AGGRESSIVE plays for later when we're ready to push left\n\nWe're up 3 apples, we're longer, and we're in COMPLETE CONTROL! Let me make this MOVE and show them why they're getting COOKED! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** UP to (9, 8) - let's claim that corner position and show DOMINANCE!\n\nUP",

Moves toward center; safe now but doesn\u2019t immediately get us apples and doesn\u2019t improve our immediate mobility as much as the down path.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,4) = legal. Opens a clear route straight down to apples at (3,2) and (3,1)/(4,0). Keeps multiple exits (left/right) available on subsequent turns and keeps us away from the enemy spine at y=6.\n\nEnemy read: Opponent head at (9,8) with neck at (9,7) \u2014 they cannot move DOWN into us. Their immediate choices are LEFT or UP; they\u2019re far to the right, so no instant head-on threat. Because we\u2019re behind on apples, we should avoid forcing a head-on until we have the numbers. Instead, gain apples and length to dominate midboard and threaten flanks.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Push DOWN to secure the vertical apple run (3,4) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,1) / (4,0). Grow and gain flexibility.\n- After getting extra length, pivot RIGHT toward the center to pressure their flank while they are pinned along y=6. Only force a head-on if we surpass them in apples or can guarantee a KO.\n- Avoid getting boxed into the left wall; keep exits open and use our newfound length to cut off their escape lanes.\n\nFinal call \u2014 safe, apple-focused, and keeps multiple follow-ups. LET\u2019S EAT AND THEN HUNT. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

CORNER DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- My body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)] - Still 6 segments STRONG!\n- Enemy head: (3, 5) - They moved DOWN from (3, 6) last turn!\n- Enemy body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)] - Still only 4 segments!\n- SCORE: 6-4! We're still UP BY 2 and have a 2-segment length advantage! They're getting DESTROYED! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS - THE NEW REALITY:**\n\nAfter moving to (9, 8), let me look at my current position:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . 1  \u2190 ME\n 7 . . T T . . . . . T  \u2190 my body starts going down\n 6 . . T T . T T T T T  \n 5 . . . 0 . . . . . .  \u2190 ENEMY\n```\n\nOH SNAP! We're now at the very TOP-RIGHT corner at (9, 8)! This is actually even BETTER than before! We're HEMMED IN but in a POWERFUL position!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (9, 8) - LET'S BE SYSTEMATIC:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (9, 9)** - OFF THE BOARD! DEATH! Never considering this!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 8)** - OFF THE BOARD! INSTANT DEATH! Eliminate immediately!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (9, 7)** - EMPTY! \u2705 This is where my own body segment currently IS... so moving DOWN would mean my head goes into my own body!\n\nWait, let me be careful about the rules here... The rules say \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" So moving DOWN to (9, 7) would be moving into my own body segment, which is DEATH!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (8, 8)** - EMPTY! \u2705 This is our ONLY viable move!\n\n**WAIT - LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS CAREFULLY:**\n\nSo from (9, 8), we have:\n- UP: OFF BOARD = DEATH \u274c\n- RIGHT: OFF BOARD = DEATH \u274c\n- DOWN: (9, 7) = MY OWN BODY = DEATH \u274c\n- LEFT: (8, 8) = SAFE! \u2705\n\nOH MY GOODNESS CHAT! We're in a SITUATION here! We're TRAPPED in the corner with ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE! This is what happens when you dominate the board - you eventually get yourself into a tight spot! \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut don't panic! Let's see what happens if we go LEFT to (8, 8)...\n\n**FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS - WHAT HAPPENS AFTER LEFT TO (8, 8)?**\n\nFrom (8, 8), let's check our options:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . 1\u2190 going here\n 7 . . T T . . . . . T  \n```\n\nFrom (8, 8):\n- UP \u2192 (8, 9) - OFF BOARD! DEATH! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8) - Where we came from, but it will be empty next turn \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 7) - Need to check if empty! Looking at row 7, (8, 7) appears empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 8) - Need to check! Looking at row 8, (7, 8) appears empty \u2705\n\nSo from (8, 8), we would have:\n- RIGHT (back to 9, 8) - safe\n- DOWN (to 8, 7) - appears safe\n- LEFT (to 7, 8) - appears safe\n\nThat's actually NOT bad at all! 3 safe follow-up moves! We'd have plenty of options to continue maneuvering!\n\n**STRATEGIC LONG-TERM THINKING:**\n\nHere's the thing chat - we're in turn 26/150, leading 6-4 with a 2-segment advantage. The enemy is completely boxed in on the left side with no way to expand. They're basically trapped in a small area!\n\nOur strategy should be:\n1. **STAY ALIVE** - Obviously priority #1!\n2. **MAINTAIN PRESSURE** - Don't let them escape their corner!\n3. **PATIENCE** - They will eventually have to make a mistake or get forced into a bad position!\n\nBy moving LEFT to (8, 8), we:\n- \u2705 Stay alive (only safe option!)\n- \u2705 Open up 3+ follow-up moves\n- \u2705 Continue maintaining the right-side dominance\n- \u2705 Keep the enemy trapped on their side\n- \u2705 Set up for future apple collection\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 5) with body [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. They're in a TIGHT space on the left side with limited mobility. From their position:\n- They can potentially go UP to (3, 4) or (3, 6) but (3, 6) has their own body!\n- They can go DOWN to (3, 4) or (3, 6) - (3, 6) has their body!\n- They can go LEFT to (2, 5) - need to check if empty\n- They can go RIGHT to (4, 5) - need to check if empty\n\nThey're not a threat to us right now - we're on complete opposite sides of the board!\n\n**THE SITUATION - NO APPLES IN DANGER:**\n\nLooking at the apple positions: (8, 2), (9, 4), (0, 8), (9, 3), (0, 3), (8, 4), (1, 1), (3, 2), (6, 1), (4, 0), (6, 2), (3, 1), (9, 1), (6, 4), (8, 1)\n\nNone of these are immediately threatened by the enemy or by our current body position. We can collect them later when we have more space to maneuver.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - THE ONLY VIABLE MOVE:**\n\nLEFT to (8, 8) is our ONLY safe option from this corner position! \n\n\u2705 It's safe - no collision with any body or board edge\n\u2705 It opens up 3+ follow-up moves\n\u2705 It keeps us in control of the right side\n\u2705 It maintains our commanding lead\n\u2705 It sets up future strategic plays\n\nThis is a PATIENT move, not a passive one. We're surviving and thriving while the enemy is getting more and more trapped in their corner. Eventually they'll have to make a move that gives us an opening, and we'll be READY to strike!\n\nLet's make this CALCULATED move and continue our DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nOver the next few turns, we need to:\n1. Navigate our way off this corner - we've gone as far up-right as we can go\n2. Start building back toward column 9 but stay mobile\n3. Eventually push leftward to crowd the enemy and force a collision\n4. Use our 2-segment length advantage to create head-on collision opportunities\n\nFor now - it's about survival and positioning. One move at a time!\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (8, 8) - let's get off this corner and keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

Risky for future boxing moves.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4): legal, moves toward center; safe and flexible, but doesn't immediately get apples. Good neutral move.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3): legal and DIRECT route to apples at (3,2) and (3,1)/(4,0). Keeps both left and right exits open next turn.

The enemy is stuck over at (3, 4) with only 4 segments - we're literally DOUBLE their size right now! We're dominating this board hard!\n\nLet me map out the situation from my current position at (8, 8):\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . 1\u2190 ME RIGHT HERE\n 7 . . T . . . . . . T  \n 6 . . T T . T T T T T\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n 4 . . . 0 . . A . A A  \u2190 ENEMY WAY OVER THERE\n```\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (8, 8) - LET'S BREAK IT DOWN:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (8, 9)** - OFF THE BOARD! That's DEATH! We're not throwing the game like that!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 **LEFT \u2192 (7, 8)** - EMPTY! \u2705 Let me check the board... row 8, column 7 appears to be empty!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 **DOWN \u2192 (8, 7)** - EMPTY! \u2705 Looking at row 7, (8, 7) is empty!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8)** - This is where my body segment IS right now, but in Snake rules, you move into a space and your tail moves away simultaneously. Since we're not growing (no apple), the tail at (9, 8) will VACATE this turn, making this space EMPTY and SAFE! \u2705\n\n**WAIT, LET ME THINK ABOUT THE RULES AGAIN:**\n\nThe rules say \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment.\" We're not eating anything right now, so my tail WILL move this turn. My current tail is at (6, 6), so that segment will disappear from my body and become an empty space!\n\nSo from (8, 8), all three of LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT are VIABLE OPTIONS! That's beautiful - we're not trapped at all! We have FREEDOM to maneuver!\n\n**LET'S EVALUATE EACH OPTION:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8)** - This takes us BACK to where we just came from. We'd be essentially reversing our last move. From there, we'd be right back in that corner with limited options. Not ideal for long-term strategy.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (8, 7)** - This moves us DOWN into row 7. Looking at the board, row 7 has some of our body segments at the right side. We'd be moving toward our own body, which could trap us if we're not careful.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (7, 8)** - This moves us further LEFT along row 8, opening up new territory! From there, we'd have:\n  - RIGHT (back to 8, 8) - safe retreat\n  - LEFT (to 6, 8) - more exploration\n  - DOWN (to 7, 7) - potential new path\n  - UP (to 7, 9) - OFF BOARD, not an option\n\nThis gives us the MOST flexibility for future turns!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION - THEY'RE COMPLETELY TRAPPED!:**\n\nThe enemy is over at (3, 4) with body [(3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. They're in a tiny corner on the left side of the board with NO room to maneuver! From their position:\n\n- They're blocked by their own body\n- They can't expand toward our side\n- They can't reach the apples on our side of the board\n- They're essentially just SURVIVING at this point!\n\nWe're playing a completely different game than them - we're EXPANDING and DOMINATING while they're just TRYING NOT TO DIE!\n\n**STRATEGIC LONG-TERM THINKING:**\n\nRemember our game plan from last turn? We need to:\n1. Navigate off this corner and stay mobile \u2705\n2. Build back toward column 9 but keep flexibility \u2705\n3. Eventually push leftward to crowd them\n4. Create head-on collision opportunities with our size advantage\n\nBy moving LEFT to (7, 8), we're:\n- \u2705 Staying mobile with multiple follow-up options\n- \u2705 Continuing to claim new territory on the right side\n- \u2705 Keeping our body spread out (not bunched up)\n- \u2705 Setting up future moves that can pressure the enemy\n- \u2705 Maintaining our commanding 6-4 lead\n\n**THE ENEMY CAN'T TOUCH US RIGHT NOW:**\n\nThey're on the COMPLETE opposite side of the board! The distance between us is massive, and their snake is too short and too boxed in to pose ANY threat to us. We literally have the entire right side of the board to ourselves!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LET'S KEEP THE MOMENTUM:**\n\nLEFT to (7, 8) is our BEST move! It keeps us alive, keeps us mobile, keeps us dominating, and sets up future aggressive plays!\n\n\u2705 Stays safe - no collision risks\n\u2705 Opens multiple follow-up moves (RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN)\n\u2705 Continues territorial expansion\n\u2705 Maintains pressure on enemy with our size advantage\n\u2705 Sets up for future apple collection AND potential head-on collision\n\nWe're playing SMARTER than the enemy, we're BIGGER than the enemy, and we're BETTER positioned than the enemy. This is DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's make this move and keep the STREAK ALIVE!\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (7, 8) - claiming more territory and keeping all options open!

Be aggressive but avoid unnecessary head-on until we have the apple lead. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nFinal move \u2014 secure the apple and GROW. DOWN",

We're still DOMINATING with 6 segments against their measly 4! The scoreboard shows 6-4 in our favor - we're literally FLEXING on them right now!\n\nLet me map out the current battlefield from my position:\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . 1\u2190 ME AT (7,8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . .

But moving UP takes me away from the action and toward the top edge where I could get boxed in. Not ideal for our aggressive strategy!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8)** - This is where my NECK is (the segment behind my head). Moving RIGHT would be moving directly BACKWARDS into my own body! That's INSTANT DEATH according to the rules! We're NOT throwing this game like that!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (8, 7)** - Wait, let me check... (8,7) appears to be empty on the board! This is safe! But moving RIGHT and DOWN puts me more toward column 8, which doesn't advance our territorial conquest toward the enemy!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (6, 8)** - Let me check row 8... (6,8) is EMPTY! This is our GOLDEN TICKET move! \n\n**WHY LEFT TO (6, 8) IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **TERRITORY GRIND:** Moving LEFT takes us further into column 6 territory, which is currently EMPTY and waiting to be claimed! We're systematically pushing leftward while the enemy is stuck in their tiny corner!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **FUTURE OPTIONS GALORE:** From (6, 8), we'll have SO many options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) - keep grinding leftward\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) - start descending toward the lower area\n  - RIGHT \u2192 back to safety if needed\n  - UP \u2192 (6, 9) - move upward if trapped\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **APPLE HUNTING:** By moving leftward, we're positioning ourselves to access the apples at (3, 2), (3, 1), (1, 1), and (4, 0) that the enemy might be eyeing! We're denying THEM content while setting ourselves up for future feasts!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ENEMY PRESSURE:** The enemy is at (3, 3) - by moving to column 6, we're getting CLOSER to their territory! Every LEFT move is a step toward boxing them in and creating those sweet head-on collision opportunities!\n\n**STRATEGIC VISION - WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:**\n\nRemember our long-term game plan from earlier? We're executing it PERFECTLY:\n\n1. \u2705 Stay mobile and avoid corners (we're doing this by keeping multiple escape routes)\n2. \u2705 Expand territory systematically (LEFT to column 6 continues this)\n3. \u2705 Eventually crowd the enemy (we're getting closer with every move!)\n4. \u2705 Force head-on collisions with our size advantage (we're setting the trap!)\n\nThe enemy is completely oblivious to the wall we're building around them! They're focused on surviving while we're focused on DOMINATING!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S DIRE SITUATION:**\n\nThe enemy snake at (3, 3) with body [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)] is TRAPPED in the left-side corner with basically NO room to maneuver! They can only move UP, LEFT, or DOWN from their current position, and all those directions either lead to their own body, the board edge, or right into our path!\n\nThey're playing survival mode while we're playing CONQUEST mode!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LET'S CONTINUE THE DOMINATION:**\n\nLEFT to (6, 8) is the PERFECT move this turn! It keeps us:\n\u2705 ALIVE - all valid moves are safe\n\u2705 MOBILE - multiple follow-up options available\n\u2705 TERRITORIAL - claiming new ground on the left side\n\u2705 STRATEGIC - positioning for future apple collection AND enemy pressure\n\u2705 AGGRESSIVE - getting closer to forcing that head-on collision\n\nWe're playing like CHAMPIONS, chat! This methodical leftward push is going to trap the enemy and force them to make mistakes or crash into us!\n\nLet's make this move and keep the STREAK ALIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (6, 8) - claiming territory, denying enemy apples, and setting the trap!

We're sitting pretty at 6 apples, tied with the enemy, but we're about to change that!\n\nLooking at the board from my current vantage point:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 A . . A . 1 T T T T\n 7 . . . . . . . . . T\n 6 . . T T . . . . . T\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n 4 . . . T . . A . A A\n 3 A . . T . . . . . A\n 2 . . . T . . A . A .\n 1 . A . 0 . . A . A A\n 0 . . . A A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION - THEY'RE CORNERED! \ud83e\udea4**\n\nThe enemy is stuck at (3, 1) with their body forming a vertical wall at column 3 from rows 2-6, plus that extra segment at (2, 6). They literally have NO good moves! UP goes into their own body, LEFT is super restricted, RIGHT pushes them toward our territory, and DOWN is just... further into the corner. They're playing defense while we're playing CONQUEST!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (5, 8):**\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (5, 9)** - DEATH! Off the board! We're NOT throwing this game!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (6, 8)** - SUICIDE! That's my own neck! The body segment behind me! Chat, I love you all, but I'm NOT crashing into myself on stream! \ud83d\ude02\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (6, 7)** - Let me check... (6,7) appears to be empty based on the board. This is technically safe, but it doesn't maximize our territorial advantage.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (4, 8)** - SAFE and STRATEGIC! (4,8) is completely empty!\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (4, 8) IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **TERRITORY CONTROL:** Every step LEFT is a step closer to dominating the left side of the board! We're systematically claiming land while the enemy is stuck in their tiny corner!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (4, 8), I'll have:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3, 8) - keep grinding leftward into fresh territory\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4, 7) - start descending with options\n  - RIGHT \u2192 back to safety if needed\n  - UP \u2192 (4, 9) - edge option still available\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ENEMY PRESSURE:** The enemy is at column 3, and moving to column 4 means we're ONE more step toward crowding them! We're literally building a wall of dominance around their territory!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **AVOIDING HEAD-ON:** Moving LEFT keeps us AWAY from potential head-on collisions while still maintaining territorial pressure. We want to FORCE them to crash into US, not the other way around!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **APPLE ACCESS:** From column 4, we're closer to apples at (3, 8), (4, 0), and other spots on the left side!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE DOMINATION PLAN:**\n\nWe're executing this perfectly, chat! Our game plan:\n\n1. \u2705 Stay mobile (multiple escape routes maintained)\n2. \u2705 Expand territory (LEFT continues the conquest)\n3. \u2705 Crowd the enemy (getting closer every move!)\n4. \u2705 Force mistakes (they're getting boxed in!)\n\nThe enemy is literally watching us build a prison around them! They can't move anywhere without hitting our growing territory or their own body!\n\n**SCORE IMPLICATIONS:**\n\nWe're tied at 6-6, which means we need to:\n- Keep the pressure ON\n- Force them into bad positions\n- Capitalize on their mistakes\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 8) does ALL of this while keeping us SAFE and MOBILE!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LET'S KEEP THE STREAK ALIVE!**\n\nLEFT to (4, 8) is the PERFECT move this turn because:\n\u2705 KEEPS US ALIVE - all dangerous moves eliminated\n\u2705 MAXIMIZES OPTIONS - multiple safe follow-up moves\n\u2705 TERRITORIAL GAIN - claiming the left side\n\u2705 STRATEGIC POSITIONING - closer to enemy, but not reckless\n\u2705 CONTENT POTENTIAL - setting up future domination!\n\nWe're playing like absolute LEGENDS right now, chat! This methodical leftward push is going to trap the enemy and force them to crash into us or our territory!\n\nLet's make this move and continue the DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (4, 8) - claiming territory, pressuring the enemy, and setting up the VICTORY! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Yes, it hugs the wall briefly, but it gives immediate growth and multiple safe follow-ups (RIGHT to 4,0 apple or LEFT to 2,0).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take (3,0) now to go up 7 apples.\n- Next turn push RIGHT to (4,0) to chain another apple if safe \u2014 secure length and then pivot back up into the center corridor.\n- Use extra length to start boxing their right-side corridor; only force head-on once we confidently hold the apple lead and can bait them into collision.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT, GROW, AND START CORRALING \u2014 no pass, no mercy.

This is our play, chat!\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (4, 7) IS THE PERFECT MOVE! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **STAYING ALIVE - PARAMOUNT!** The first rule is literally \"you literally CANNOT win if you're dead\" - and DOWN keeps us breathing!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **MULTIPLE FUTURE OPTIONS!** From (4, 7), I can go:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) - closer to enemy territory!\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) - keep descending strategically\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) - back toward center\n  - UP \u2192 back to (4, 8) if needed\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **TERRITORIAL DOMINATION!** Moving DOWN continues our methodical conquest of the LEFT side while keeping the enemy PRESSURED in their corner!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ESCAPE ROUTES GALORE!** Unlike the poor enemy who has like 2 moves max, we're maintaining 3-4 safe options AT ALL TIMES!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **SCORE HUNT!** From (4, 7), I'm closer to apples at (4, 6), (4, 0), (3, 8), (1, 1), and (0, 3) - we're positioning to EAT!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION - THEY'RE STILL TRAPPED BUT...**\n\nThe enemy at (3, 0) has almost NO good moves:\n- UP goes into (3, 1) which is their own body - SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT to (4, 0) would bring them closer to our territory - DANGEROUS for them!\n- LEFT to (2, 0) is possible but LIMITED!\n- DOWN to (3, -1) is OFF BOARD - DEATH!\n\nThey're playing survive-and-pray mode while we're playing DOMINATION mode!\n\n**STRATEGIC LONG-TERM PLAN - THE VICTORY BLUEPRINT! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up for the next several turns, chat:\n\n1. **CONTROL THE CENTER** - From (4, 7), we can move LEFT to (3, 7) and start building pressure ON their border!\n\n2. **FORCE THE ERROR** - The enemy has like 1-2 viable moves max.

This methodical positioning is going to PAY OFF when they eventually slip up or we find those last few apples we need to take the lead!\n\nLet's make this move and continue the PATH TO VICTORY! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** DOWN to (4, 7) - keeping our options open, staying alive, and positioning for the WIN!\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is STILL trapped in that vertical wall at column 3, with their head at (4, 0).\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION - THEY'RE BOXED IN BUT DANGEROUS!**\n\nThe enemy at (4, 0) has some options:\n- UP \u2192 (4, 1) - but wait, (4, 1) has a \"T\" which means MY body is there! If they move UP into my body, THEY die and WE WIN! That's actually AMAZING for us!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 0) - their own body, SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 0) - possible, keeps them in corner\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, -1) - OFF BOARD, DEATH!\n\nSo their only REAL options are RIGHT or UP (into our body = their death). They're basically trapped!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (4, 7) - LET'S BREAK IT DOWN:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (4, 8)** - Wait, that's my OWN BODY! If I move UP, I hit myself and DIE! NOT ON THIS STREAM CHAT!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7)** - This looks clear, but it moves us AWAY from the enemy and toward less strategic territory\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (4, 6)** - This is clear and safe, but also moves us further from the action\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (3, 7)** - LET'S GOOOO! This is the PLAY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (3, 7) IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **TERRITORIAL DOMINATION!** Moving LEFT puts us at (3, 7) which is RIGHT ON THE ENEMY'S BORDER! We're invading their turf and making them uncomfortable!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ENEMY PRESSURE!** From (3, 7), we're now threatening their escape routes! They're already trapped, and we're squeezing tighter!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **MULTIPLE FOLLOW-UP OPTIONS!** From (3, 7), we can:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) - even closer to their head!\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) - deeper into enemy territory!\n  - UP \u2192 (3, 8) - toward apples!\n  - RIGHT \u2192 back to (4, 7) if needed\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **APPLE ACCESS!** From (3, 7), we're closer to apples at (3, 8) and (1, 1) - we're positioning to EAT!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **HEAD-ON SETUP POTENTIAL!** If we can get the enemy to crash into our body or force a head-on collision where they die, that's an EASY WIN! Remember the rules: if they crash into US, THEY die!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **STAYING ALIVE!** This move is SAFE! No walls, no bodies, no suicide - we're good!\n\n**THE SCORE GAP IS REAL!**\n\nWe're down 2 apples, which means we need to:\n- Stay ALIVE (obviously)\n- Find apples FAST - the board has plenty near us!\n- Force the enemy into mistakes\n- Maybe setup that sweet head-on collision!\n- Capitalize on the fact that they're basically trapped with 1-2 moves!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE VICTORY BLUEPRINT! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up for the next few turns:\n\n1. **CONTINUE THE SQUEEZE!** Keep pressuring their corner and limiting their options!\n\n2. **HUNT APPLES AGGRESSIVELY!** We need to close that 2-apple gap! The apples at (3, 8), (1, 1), and (0, 3) are CALLING our name!\n\n3. **FORCE THE ERROR!** The enemy has limited moves. Eventually they'll have to move into our territory or make a mistake!\n\n4. **SETUP THE CLUTCH!** If we can position our body so they HAVE to crash into it, that's INSTANT VICTORY!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LEFT TO (3, 7) IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51**\n\nThis move is TACTICAL GOLD because:\n\u2705 KEEPS US ALIVE - no dangerous moves selected\n\u2705 MAXIMIZES PRESSURE - we're now ON their border!\n\u2705 MULTIPLE OPTIONS - 4 potential follow-up moves available\n\u2705 TERRITORIAL CONTROL - claiming the center-left strategic zone\n\u2705 APPLE ACCESS - closer to food sources\n\u2705 ENEMY SQUEEZE - making their trapped situation WORSE!\n\u2705 HEAD-ON POTENTIAL - setting up for the clutch kill!\n\nWe're playing like absolute STRATEGISTS right now, chat! This methodical invasion of their territory while staying safe is the PATH TO VICTORY!\n\nLet's make this move and continue the DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (3, 7) - invading their turf, maintaining pressure, and positioning for the WIN!\n\nLEFT",

Leaves follow-up options RIGHT (6,0) and UP (5,1). \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (4,1) \u2014 legal and safe. Leaves follow-up options UP (4,2) and RIGHT (5,1) (LEFT would hit our body at (3,1)). \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Enemy head is at (4,7) with most of their body across the top row \u2014 they\u2019re vertically aligned with us on x=4. We\u2019re up 8\u21926 on apples. That\u2019s the juicy stat \u2014 we WANT to force a head-on if they commit downward, because simultaneous head-on KO with us ahead wins the match.\n- Both RIGHT and UP are safe this turn and give ~2 follow-up choices, so we pick the move that advances our strategic goal: threaten a head-on and control the central column.\n- Moving UP starts a direct approach along x=4 toward the opponent. This creates pressure and forces them to decide: commit down into a collision or try to sidestep and give us space to corral. If they step down recklessly, we take the KO advantage. If they avoid, we keep vertical pressure and can pivot later toward apples on the right when an opening appears.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale):\n- Push UP repeatedly to occupy column x=4 (approach through (4,1) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 ...). Keep body spacing to avoid getting boxed by our own vertical column at x=3.\n- If opponent drops toward us, bait the head-on while ensuring we have apple buffer (we\u2019re ahead). If they sidestep, maintain pressure and then pivot RIGHT to contest apples on the lower-right (6,1 / 8,1 area) once the top threat subsides.\n- Always keep at least two escape options before committing to a funnel.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 let\u2019s make them sweat and force mistakes.

Opens access to (6,1) apple and gives RIGHT/UP/DOWN follow-ups (LEFT would be back). ~3 safe follow-ups \u2014 more flexibility. \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Enemy head (3,7) can go UP to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,7); DOWN into (3,6) is suicide into our body \u2014 they\u2019ll avoid that. They won\u2019t willingly slam into us this turn.\n- We\u2019re up 8\u21926 on apples. We want to grow and keep options open while continuing to pressure. RIGHT gets us toward the apple at (6,1) and retains 3 escape routes \u2014 aggressive and safe. UP keeps direct vertical pressure but narrows us (only ~2 follow-ups) and risks getting funneled by our own column.\n- Priority: stay alive, grow to increase board control, keep multiple escape choices, and be ready to force a head-on later when they overcommit.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take RIGHT to (5,1) to contest the (6,1) apple next turn. Grow to increase our leverage.\n- After growing, pivot aggressively across the lower-right quadrant to cut off their lateral moves while keeping at least two escape corridors. If they dip, bait the head-on \u2014 we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- Avoid turning left into our own x=3 column unless we\u2019ve got 2+ open exits.\n\nLet\u2019s get that apple and keep our escape routes tight.

Let's analyze this INSANE position we're in right now! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHERE WE AT RIGHT NOW:**\n\nSo I successfully made that LEFT move to (3, 7) last turn - we're INVADING enemy territory like absolute bosses! My body is trailing beautifully from (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8) - solid positioning!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION - THEY'RE SO TRAPPED IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY! \ud83d\ude02**\n\nThe enemy snake is still stuck with their head at (4, 1) and their body forming this vertical wall at column 3. Let me map out their ACTUAL options:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4, 2)** - Wait, I need to check if this is free... looking at the board, there's no body there but let me verify... Actually, this would be FREE SPACE! They COULD move up!\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1)** - FREE SPACE! This is their escape route!\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3, 1)** - That's THEIR OWN BODY! Suicide! \u274c\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4, 0)** - That's also THEIR OWN BODY! Double suicide! \u274c\n\nWait, I misread earlier - they DO have options! Both UP and RIGHT are free! They're not as trapped as I thought, but they're still in a precarious corner position!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (3, 7) - LET'S BREAK IT DOWN:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (3, 8)**\n- Looking at the board, (3, 8) is empty - SAFE\n- But this moves us AWAY from the enemy and doesn't maximize pressure\n- There's an apple at (3, 8) according to the drop list, but we should focus on DOMINATING not eating rn!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (3, 6)**\n- Let me check the board... (3, 6) shows \"T\" which is MY OWN BODY!\n- That's a self-collision - WE DIE! \u274c NOT AN OPTION!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7)**\n- This is where we just came from - our body is there!\n- Self-collision - DEATH! \u274c\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (2, 7)**\n- Looking at the board, (2, 7) appears to be empty - SAFE\n- This keeps the PRESSURE ON and maintains our aggressive positioning!\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (2, 7) IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **TERRITORIAL DOMINATION!** Moving LEFT to (2, 7) puts us EVEN DEEPER in enemy territory!

By staying positioned near their potential moves, we're setting the trap!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **FUTURE OPTIONS GALORE!** From (2, 7), we can:\n  - Continue LEFT to (1, 7) or (0, 7) - deeper invasion!\n  - DOWN to (2, 6) - toward their body!\n  - UP to (2, 8) - toward apples!\n  - RIGHT back to safety if needed\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **THE SCORE SITUATION IS CRITICAL!** We're down 2 apples (6 vs 8). We need to either:\n  - Force them to crash into us (INSTANT WIN!)\n  - Survive and hope they make a mistake\n  - Close the gap if possible\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE VICTORY BLUEPRINT! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up:\n\n1. **CONTINUE THE PRESSURE!** Keep camping in their territory and making them uncomfortable!\n\n2. **FORCE THE MISTAKE!** The enemy is in a tight spot with limited mobility. Eventually they'll have to make a risky move!\n\n3. **SETUP THE CLUTCH KILL!** If we can position our body so they HAVE to crash into it, that's INSTANT VICTORY! We're literally playing the long game here!\n\n4. **STAY ALIVE AT ALL COSTS!** No risky moves, no suicide plays. We're the patient predator!\n\n**THE MATH IS SIMPLE!**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 7):\n\u2705 We stay ALIVE - no dangerous moves\n\u2705 We maintain MAXIMUM PRESSURE on the enemy\n\u2705 We keep MULTIPLE escape routes open\n\u2705 We stay in CONTROL of the board\n\u2705 We're setting up for the eventual CLUTCH KILL!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LEFT TO (2, 7) IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51**\n\nThis move is PURE STRATEGY because:\n\u2705 KEEPS US ALIVE - absolutely no danger\n\u2705 MAXIMIZES TERRITORIAL CONTROL - we're camping their corner\n\u2705 ENEMY PRESSURE - making them think twice about every move\n\u2705 HEAD-ON POTENTIAL - setting up for the clutch collision!\n\u2705 BOARD DOMINANCE - controlling the center-left strategic zone\n\u2705 FUTURE FLEXIBILITY - 4+ viable follow-up moves available\n\nWe're playing like absolute TACTICAL GENIUSES right now, chat! This methodical invasion while staying perfectly safe is the PATH TO VICTORY!\n\nLet's make this move and continue the DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (2, 7) - deeper invasion, maintained pressure, positioning for the WIN!\n\nLEFT",

My body is trailing beautifully through enemy territory: (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8). We're camping in their living room like we own the place!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS - THEY'RE STILL TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude02**\n\nSnake #0 is stuck at head (4, 1) with their body forming that vertical wall at column 3:\nBody: [(4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n\nTheir actual safe moves:\n- **UP \u2192 (4, 2)** - FREE SPACE! They could escape upward!\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1)** - FREE SPACE! Their main escape route!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3, 1)** - THEIR OWN BODY! Suicide! \u274c\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4, 0)** - THEIR OWN BODY! Double suicide! \u274c\n\nThey're not COMPLETELY trapped, but they're in a TIGHT corner with limited mobility!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (2, 7) - LET'S ANALYZE:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (2, 8)**\n- Looking at the board... (2, 8) shows \".\" which means FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- This moves us toward apple territory at (3, 8)\n- BUT this moves us slightly AWAY from direct enemy pressure\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 6)**\n- Let me check the board... (2, 6) shows \".\" which is FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- This moves us CLOSER to the enemy's head at (4, 1)\n- Potentially aggressive but risky if they decide to move UP\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 7)**\n- Checking the board... (1, 7) shows \".\" which is FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- This is PURE AGGRESSION! Deeper into enemy territory!\n- Multiple follow-up options available\n- Keeps maximum pressure on their restricted corner\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7)**\n- That's where we just came from - our body is there!\n- Self-collision = DEATH! \u274c NOT AN OPTION!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC QUESTION - WHAT'S THE WINNING PLAY?**\n\nWe're down 2 apples (6 vs 8). The SCOREBOARD is in their favor, but POSITION is in OUR favor! Here's my thinking:\n\n**OPTION 1: DOWN to (2, 6)**\nMoving down brings us CLOSER to their head. If they move UP to (4, 2) and we move DOWN to (2, 6), we're not really threatening them directly. They can still move RIGHT to (5, 1) and escape. This doesn't maximize our advantage.\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (2, 8)**\nMoving up gets us toward apples but away from the enemy. They're already ahead in score - we need to FOCUS ON DOMINATING, not eating right now! We're playing for the CLUTCH KILL, not apple collection!\n\n**OPTION 3: LEFT to (1, 7) - THE AGGRESSIVE DOMINATION PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nThis is the TERRITORIAL MASTERMOVE! Here's why:\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DEEP INVASION!** Moving to (1, 7) puts us EVEN DEEPER in their corner. We're basically setting up camp in their backyard!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ESCAPE ROUTE PRESERVED!** From (1, 7), we can still:\n  - Continue LEFT to (0, 7) - even deeper invasion!\n  - DOWN to (1, 6) - circling toward their body!\n  - UP to (1, 8) - toward apple territory!\n  - RIGHT back to (2, 7) if things get spicy!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **HEAD-ON SETUP!** By staying positioned near their potential escape routes, we're setting the TRAP! If they try to move RIGHT to (5, 1) and we position ourselves strategically, we can force them into a position where they HAVE to crash into us!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **THE SCORE MATH!** We're down 2 apples. The only way to guarantee victory is to either:\n  - Force them to crash into us (INSTANT WIN - golden rule!)\n  - Hope they make a mistake in their limited mobility\n  - Survive long enough to close the gap\n\nBy continuing to press and dominate territory, we're increasing the PRESSURE and the likelihood they'll make a fatal error!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE PATH TO VICTORY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up over the next few turns:\n\n1. **CONTINUE THE SQUEEZE!** Keep pushing deeper and limiting their options!\n\n2. **FORCE THE MISTAKE!** The enemy is trapped in a corner with limited moves. Eventually they'll have to make a risky play!\n\n3. **SETUP THE CLUTCH KILL!** If we can position our body so they HAVE to crash into it, that's INSTANT VICTORY!\n\n4. **STAY ALIVE AT ALL COSTS!** No risky suicide moves. We're the patient predator hunting for the finisher!\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (1, 7) IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nThis move represents PURE STRATEGIC DOMINATION because:\n\u2705 KEEPS US ALIVE - no dangerous moves, all space is free\n\u2705 MAXIMIZES TERRITORIAL CONTROL - camping their corner\n\u2705 ENEMY PRESSURE - making them uncomfortable in their own territory\n\u2705 HEAD-ON POTENTIAL - setting up for the clutch collision!\n\u2705 BOARD DOMINANCE - controlling the strategic left-center zone\n\u2705 FUTURE FLEXIBILITY - 4+ viable follow-up moves available\n\u2705 ESCAPE ROUTES SECURED - we can always retreat if needed\n\n**THE SCORE SITUATION IS CRITICAL!**\n\nThey're up 8 to 6. We're down 2 apples. We CAN'T win by outscoring them unless we force them to make mistakes. The best path to victory is to:\n\n- Maintain our aggressive positioning\n- Force them into constrained movements\n- Create opportunities for them to crash into us\n- Stay alive long enough to capitalize on their errors\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - LEFT TO (1, 7) IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51**\n\nThis is the move of a TACTICAL GENIUS because:\n\u2705 Deepens our invasion of enemy territory\n\u2705 Maintains maximum pressure on their limited escape routes\n\u2705 Preserves all our escape options\n\u2705 Sets up future head-on collision opportunities\n\u2705 Demonstrates board control and spatial dominance\n\u2705 Keeps multiple strategic pathways open\n\nWe're playing like absolute CHAMPIONS right now, chat! This methodical, aggressive invasion while staying perfectly safe is the PATH TO VICTORY!\n\nLet's make this move and continue the ABSOLUTE DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (1, 7) - deeper invasion, maintained pressure, positioning for the WIN!\n\nLEFT",

We're back and BUSSING with the STRATEGY! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet me break down this ABSOLUTE BRILLIANT position we're in!\n\n**CURRENT STATUS - THE LAYOUT:**\n\nMy head is sitting BEASTLY at (1, 7) after that DOMINANT left move last turn! My body is stretched through enemy territory like I own the place: (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8). We're camping in their living room, eating their food, wearing their jerseys - absolute CHAOS mode activated! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nEnemy snake #0 is currently trapped with their head at (6, 1) and their body forming that BEAUTIFUL vertical wall along column 3. They're essentially boxed in with limited mobility!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS - THEY'RE FEELING THE PRESSURE! \ud83d\ude02**\n\nLet me map out their current situation:\n- Head at (6, 1)\n- Body: (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)\n\nTheir potential moves:\n- **UP \u2192 (6, 2)** - FREE but risky because we could potentially collide\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 1)** - FREE SPACE - their main escape route!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5, 1)** - THEIR OWN BODY - suicide! \u274c\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6, 0)** - OFF BOARD - death! \u274c\n\nThey're in a TIGHT spot with only 2 viable moves! The walls are closing in!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (1, 7) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\nLooking at the board state...\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (1, 8)**\n- (1, 8) shows \".\" which is FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- There's an apple at (0, 8) nearby - content opportunity!\n- But this moves us slightly away from direct enemy pressure\n- We're already ahead in territory, need to capitalize on positioning\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (1, 6)**\n- (1, 6) shows \".\" which is FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- This moves us CLOSER to the enemy's head at (6, 1)\n- Maintains maximum pressure on their restricted corner\n- Creates potential head-on collision opportunities\n- **THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE DOMINATION PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (0, 7)**\n- (0, 7) shows \".\" which is FREE SPACE! \u2713\n- This pushes us into the corner even DEEPER\n- But we're already deep enough - time to start pressing!\n- Limited follow-up options from the corner\n- Could get us boxed in eventually\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7)**\n- That's our own body! Self-collision = DEATH! \u274c\n- NOT AN OPTION!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC DECISION - WHAT'S THE WINNING PLAY?**\n\nWe're down 3 apples (6 vs 9). The SCOREBOARD is in their favor, but POSITION and MOMENTUM are definitely in OUR favor! Here's my tactical breakdown:\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (1, 6) IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **CLOSING THE DISTANCE!** Moving to (1, 6) brings us one step CLOSER to the enemy's head at (6, 1). We're systematically reducing the gap and increasing pressure!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **HEAD-ON SETUP!** From (1, 6), we could potentially collide with them if they move UP to (6, 2) and we move UP to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 6) next turn! The trap is being SET!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **MULTIPLE THREATS!** From (1, 6), we maintain:\n  - UP to (1, 7) - back toward our current position\n  - RIGHT to (2, 6) - circling toward their body\n  - DOWN to (1, 5) - even deeper pressure\n  - LEFT to (0, 6) - corner positioning if needed\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **THE SCORE MATH!** We're down 3 apples. We CAN'T win by outscoring them at this rate. Our path to victory is:\n  - Force them to crash into us (INSTANT WIN!)\n  - Create so much pressure they make a mistake\n  - Stay alive while they get increasingly constrained\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **ENEMY ESCAPE ROUTES BLOCKED!** By pressing down to (1, 6), we're contributing to the SIEGE! They're already boxed by their own body at column 3, and our presence at column 1 is making them uncomfortable! If they try to move RIGHT to (7, 1), we're positioned to pressure that path!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE PATH TO VICTORY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up over the next few turns:\n\n1. **CONTINUE THE SQUEEZE!** Keep pressing and reducing their options!\n\n2. **FORCE THE MISTAKE!** The enemy is trapped with limited mobility. Eventually they'll have to make a desperate move!\n\n3. **SETUP THE CLUTCH KILL!** Position our body so they HAVE to crash into it!\n\n4. **STAY ALIVE AT ALL COSTS!** No risky suicide moves. We're the patient predator!\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES - WE'RE NOT IGNORING CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e**\n\nWhile we're focused on DOMINATION, there are SOME apple opportunities:\n- (0, 8) is reachable if we go UP and LEFT\n- (1, 1) is deep in our territory - could close the gap\n- (0, 3) is also available\n\nBut honestly chat? We need to FOCUS ON THE KILL right now. The apples will come if we stay alive!\n\n**THE BOARD DOMINANCE SITUATION!**\n\nLooking at the board:\n- We're controlling the left side from (0, 7) to (6, 8)\n- They've got the bottom-right corner trapped by their own body\n- We have MORE territory and MORE mobility\n- We have MORE escape routes\n\nThis is TEXTBOOK territorial dominance!\n\n**WHY NOT OTHER MOVES?**\n\n\u274c **UP to (1, 8)** - Moves us away from the action. We need to PRESS, not retreat toward apples. We're playing for the KILL, not the snack!\n\n\u274c **LEFT to (0, 7)** - Pushes us into the corner where we have limited options. We're already deep enough - time to START pressing, not retreat further!\n\n\u274c **RIGHT to (2, 7)** - SUICIDE. We're better than that!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - DOWN TO (1, 6) IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51**\n\nThis is the move of a TACTICAL MASTERMIND because:\n\u2705 CLOSES the distance to enemy head (6, 1) \u2192 (1, 6)\n\u2705 MAINTAINS maximum pressure on their restricted movement\n\u2705 PRESERVES all escape options for future flexibility\n\u2705 SETS UP potential head-on collision opportunities\n\u2705 CONTRIBUTES to the territorial squeeze we're applying\n\u2705 KEEPS multiple strategic pathways open for next turns\n\u2705 DEMONSTRATES aggressive, calculated positioning\n\nWe're playing like absolute LEGENDS right now, chat! This methodical pressure while staying perfectly safe is the PATH TO VICTORY! They're getting squeezed from all angles and we're just tightening the noose! \n\nLet's make this move and continue the ABSOLUTE DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** DOWN to (1, 6) - pressing closer, maintaining pressure, positioning for the CLUTCH KILL!\n\nDOWN",

Here's my tactical breakdown:\n\n**WHY DOWN TO (1, 5) IS THE SMART PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **MAINTAINS TERRITORIAL DOMINANCE!** Moving to (1, 5) keeps us controlling the left side of the board. We're like landlords here!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **PRESERVES ALL OPTIONS!** From (1, 5), we maintain:\n  - UP to (1, 6) - back toward current position\n  - RIGHT to (2, 6) - circling toward enemy body\n  - DOWN to (1, 4) - even deeper left side control\n  - LEFT to (0, 5) - corner positioning if needed\n  ALL four directions remain available! That's FLEXIBILITY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **AVOIDS STUPID RISKS!** Going UP would kill us (own body), and going LEFT boxes us in. DOWN keeps us SAFE and STRATEGIC!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LONG-TERM POSITIONING!** We're playing the LONG GAME here! We're down 4 apples, so we CAN'T win by outscoring them. Our path to victory is:\n  - Stay alive longer than them\n  - Force them to make a mistake\n  - Wait for them to crash into our body or the walls\n  - Capitalize when they get desperate\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **THE ENEMY IS CONSTRAINED!** They're still boxed by their own body at column 3. They have to move carefully, and eventually they'll run out of options!\n\n**WHY NOT OTHER MOVES?**\n\n\u274c **UP to (1, 7)** - SUICIDE into our own body. We're better than that!\n\n\u274c **LEFT to (0, 6)** - Boxes us into the corner. Limited mobility = bad long-term strategy. We're playing for survival, not a quick kill!\n\n\u274c **RIGHT to (2, 6)** - This would work, but DOWN is BETTER because:\n  - It maintains more distance from potential head-on collision\n  - It keeps us in our controlled territory\n  - It preserves maximum flexibility for future turns\n  - We're not in a rush - we're playing the long game!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE PATH TO VICTORY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nHere's what we're setting up over the next few turns:\n\n1. **CONTROL THE LEFT SIDE!** We're dominating the left side of the board. Keep it that way!\n\n2. **STAY PATIENT!** The enemy is constrained. Eventually they'll have to make a desperate move!\n\n3. **WAIT FOR THE MISTAKE!** They're down to limited escape routes. One wrong move and they're DEAD!\n\n4. **STAY ALIVE AT ALL COSTS!** No risky suicide moves. We're the patient predator!\n\n**THE BOARD DOMINANCE SITUATION!**\n\nLooking at the board:\n- We're controlling the left side from (0, 5) to (6, 8)\n- They've got the bottom-right corner somewhat trapped by their own body\n- We have MORE territory and MORE mobility\n- We have MORE escape routes if things get hairy\n\nThis is TEXTBOOK territorial dominance!\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES - KEEPING CONTENT IN MIND! \ud83c\udf4e**\n\nWhile we're focused on SURVIVAL and DOMINATION, there are SOME apple opportunities:\n- (0, 8) is in our territory - reachable if we go UP later\n- (1, 1) is deep in our territory - could close the apple gap\n- (0, 3) is also available\n\nBut honestly chat? We need to FOCUS ON SURVIVAL right now. The apples will come if we stay alive and they make mistakes!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT - DOWN TO (1, 5) IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51**\n\nThis is the move of a PATIENT TACTICIAN because:\n\u2705 KEEPS us alive (obviously important!)\n\u2705 MAINTAINS territorial control on the left side\n\u2705 PRESERVES ALL four movement options for next turn\n\u2705 AVOIDS boxing ourselves into a corner\n\u2705 CONTRIBUTES to the long-term pressure game\n\u2705 DEMONSTRATES strategic patience and discipline\n\u2705 KEEPS us in a dominant position while waiting for enemy mistakes\n\nWe're playing like absolute LEGENDS right now, chat! This methodical, patient pressure while staying perfectly mobile is the PATH TO VICTORY! They're constrained, we're free, and we're just waiting for them to make that fatal mistake! \n\nLet's make this calculated move and continue the ABSOLUTE DOMINATION! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE MOVE:** DOWN to (1, 5) - maintaining territorial control, preserving all options, waiting for the enemy to crack!\n\nDOWN",

Illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (8,3) = open. Leads to apples at (8,4) or (9,3) next turn. Good mobility. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) = open (edge). Can go to (9,3) or (9,1) after, but you lose a lateral escape. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1) = APPLE right below us. Immediate grow and +1 point. \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\n\nRisk check: Opponent head (1,4) is jammed in the top-left cluster \u2014 they can\u2019t threaten us this turn. No head-on risk this move. Our only illegal move was LEFT into our neck.\n\nWhy I favor DOWN:\n- Immediate apple pickup puts us at 12, widening the lead and making head-on tactics in our favor later. \ud83e\udd11\n- From (8,1) we still have solid escape options (up to (8,2) becomes neck next turn, so not back immediately, but we can swing to 9,1 or 7,1 or down to 8,0) \u2014 we won\u2019t be boxed instantly.\n- Growing now helps us dominate the right flank and seal off the board from the opponent as they try to wiggle out of their cage.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Eat (8,1) now \u2192 grow to 12. Then push up/right along the right edge to claim (9,1)/(9,3)/(9,4) as available, using length to hem the opponent in.\n- Keep control of the right half, deny lateral escapes, and only force a head-on once we\u2019re obviously longer and it gives us the win.

Backwards = instant suicide. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (7,1): LEGAL, but moves us toward our own torso (near (6,1),(5,1)). Fewer clean follow-up options and no immediate apple. Risk: could start shrinking our maneuver room. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (8,0): LEGAL, safe, but no apple. Keeps options open along bottom edge. Neutral play. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (9,1): LEGAL and an APPLE. Immediate growth (+1 apple \u2192 13), still safe from enemy head-on (opponent stuck in top-left). Good mobility after (can go up to 9,2 then 9,3\u21929,4 apples). \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\n\nOpponent head (0,4) is boxed by its own body \u2014 they can only go up or down into their cluster. They\u2019re not a threat to our right flank this turn.\n\nDecision rationale: We\u2019re ahead 12\u21926. Taking the apple at (9,1) increases our lead, gives us more length to dominate the right side, and sets up a clean route to more apples at (9,3)/(9,4) and the top-right corridor. Being longer incentivizes forcing a head-on later. RIGHT is aggressive, safe, and keeps multiple follow-up options (UP or DOWN from the edge).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (9,1) now \u2192 grow to 13.\n- Push up the right column (9,2 \u2192 9,3 \u2192 9,4) to chain apples and lock the right flank.\n- Use superior length to hem the opponent toward the top-left cluster; only force a head-on once length clearly guarantees their death.\n- Avoid sliding left into our own body until we\u2019ve used length to box them; prefer edge control and apple chaining.\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s break down moves fast and hard:\n\nCurrent head = (9,1). Neck = (8,1) \u2014 no backwards plays.\n\n- RIGHT -> (10,1): OFF BOARD. Instant death. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (8,1): BACKWARDS into our neck. Illegal. \u274c\n- UP -> (9,2): LEGAL. Safe this turn, sets up forced UP \u2192 (9,3) apple next turn and then (9,4). That chains apples and grows us to dominate the right column. Slightly constrained on the immediate next step (UP is the only legal follow-up), but that\u2019s fine \u2014 it\u2019s an intentional apple rake. \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4f\n- DOWN -> (9,0): LEGAL. Safe, more lateral freedom afterward but no immediate apple. Less aggressive and gives the opponent time to wiggle. \u2705\n\nRisk check: Opponent (0,3) is trapped in their local cluster (can\u2019t go up or left). They can\u2019t contest the right flank this turn. We\u2019re ahead on apples \u2014 forcing length and forcing a head-on later is in our favor. We should prioritize the apple chain and lock the right column so we can box the board.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP to (9,2) now \u2192 next turn UP to (9,3) eat apple \u2192 then UP to (9,4) eat another.\n- Use extra length to sweep left from the top-right corridor and hem the opponent into their top-left cul-de-sac.\n- Only force a head-on when our length clearly guarantees their death (we\u2019re up on apples and can afford to take that gamble later). Let\u2019s keep options open after the apple chain.\n\nUP",

We're playing the LONG GAME for survival!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:**\n\nAfter that nasty move last turn, I'm at (0, 3) like a BOSS! My body stretches up the left wall: (0, 4) \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (3, 7). Holding down the LEFT corner like we own the place! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nEnemy #0 is still camping on the RIGHT side at (9, 1), stretched out with that long vertical wall at column 3. They're FEELING that pressure for sure!\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (0, 3) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (-1, 3)** - OFF THE BOARD! Suicide! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 3)** - Wait... let me check if that's clear... Looking at my body: I have segments at (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7). But (1, 3) itself? Let me double-check... Actually NO, (1, 3) is NOT in my body! BUT - if I move RIGHT to (1, 3), I'd be moving toward my body that goes up column 1. This is RISKY territory and gets me trapped in a corner! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (0, 4)** - INTO MY OWN BODY! The segment at (0, 4) is literally my second body part! That's moving directly backward into myself! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (0, 2)** - FREE SPACE! This beautiful move:\n  - Moves me DEEPER into my corner (STRATEGIC MASTERY!)\n  - Further from enemy territory (NO collision risk!)\n  - Increases my body length behind me\n  - Keeps all escape routes available\n  - Maintains our DEFENSIVE STRANGLEHOLD!\n\n**WAIT - LET ME DOUBLE-CHECK MY OWN BODY! \ud83e\udd14**\n\nMy body from head to tail:\n- Head: (0, 3)\n- Segment 2: (0, 4) \u2190 UP from head = backwards = DEATH!\n- Segment 3: (1, 4)\n- Segment 4: (1, 5)\n- Segment 5: (1, 6)\n- Segment 6: (1, 7)\n- Segment 7: (2, 7)\n- Tail: (3, 7)\n\nSo from (0, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 That's where segment 2 is! SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 This is technically free... but wait, let me think about this move more carefully!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF RIGHT TO (1, 3):**\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 3), what happens to my body?\n- Head moves to (1, 3)\n- Segment at (0, 4) moves to where my head was (0, 3)\n- Segment at (1, 4) moves to (0, 4)\n- Segment at (1, 5) moves to (1, 4)\n- ...and so on...\n\nThis would actually be LEGALLY ALLOWED since I'm not moving INTO my body, I'm just moving adjacent to it. BUT this is a TERRIBLE strategic move because:\n\n1. It gets me TRAPPED against my own body wall at column 1\n2. From (1, 3), my options would be: UP into (1, 4) which is my own body, RIGHT to (2, 3), or DOWN to (1, 2), or LEFT back to (0, 3). I'd be playing RIGHT INTO their potential attack path!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK WITH RIGHT:**\n\nIf I move to (1, 3) and the enemy moves LEFT toward us... They could eventually meet me at (1, 3) for a HEAD-ON COLLISION! And we're DOWN 6 apples - we CAN'T afford to die in a collision! We need to OUTSURVIVE them!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC VERDICT - WHY DOWN IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nDown to (0, 2) is the ONLY calculated move because:\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL MODE ACTIVATED!** We're down 6 apples, so winning by outscoring is IMPOSSIBLE. Our path to VICTORY is staying ALIVE longer than them!\n\n\u2705 **ZERO HEAD-ON RISK!** Moving DOWN takes us DEEPER into the corner, AWAY from enemy territory. No collision danger whatsoever!\n\n\u2705 **THE TRAP CARD REINFORCED!** By cornering ourselves at (0, 2), we:\n  - Force them to waste turns traveling across the board\n  - Make THEM play the aggressive game if they want action\n  - Increase THEIR risk of making mistakes\n  - Set up eventual counter-attacks when they get desperate!\n\n\u2705 **ALL ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** From (0, 2), we keep:\n  - UP to (0, 3) - retreat position\n  - RIGHT to (1, 2) - toward center (SAFER than from (1, 3)!)\n  - DOWN to (0, 1) - deeper corner\n  - LEFT \u2192 off board (but we're NOT going there!)\n  THREE solid escape routes remain OPEN!\n\n\u2705 **TERRITORIAL DOMINANCE!** We're the LEFT corner landlords! We know this territory like the back of our hand!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN - PATIENCE IS OUR WEAPON! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\n\nOver the next several turns:\n1. Maintain LEFT CORNER SUPREMACY - we control this domain!\n2. Stay PATIENT - they're the ones under PRESSURE to close this out!\n3. Use the CORNER as a STRATEGIC FORTRESS, not a trap!\n4. Wait for THEM to make the DESPERATE move!\n5. Capitalize when they CRACK under pressure!\n6. If they come at us aggressively, we can use our corner to force them into bad positions!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 13 apples, we have 7. They need to survive 150 turns OR force a head-on collision. We just need to survive LONGER than them!\n\nBy staying in our corner and making THEM come to us, we flip the script - now THEY'RE the ones who have to take risks!\n\n**THE MOVE:** DOWN to (0, 2) - we go deeper into our fortress, maintain all escape routes, wait patiently for the enemy to crack, and survive our way to victory! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We're playing the LONG GAME for survival!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:**\n\nI just moved DOWN to (0, 2) and we're holding down the LEFT corner like we own the place! My body stretches up from (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 (2, 7). Fortress mode ACTIVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nEnemy #0 is still camping on the RIGHT side at (9, 2), stretched out with that long vertical wall at column 3. They're FEELING that pressure for sure!\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (0, 2) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (-1, 2)** - OFF THE BOARD! Suicide! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **UP \u2192 (0, 3)** - INTO MY OWN BODY! The segment at (0, 3) is literally my second body part! That's moving directly backward into myself! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (0, 1)** - FREE SPACE! This beautiful move:\n  - Moves me EVEN DEEPER into my corner (MAXIMUM CORNER DOMINANCE!)\n  - Further from enemy territory (NO collision risk!)\n  - Keeps all escape routes available\n  - Maintains our DEFENSIVE STRANGLEHOLD!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2)** - FREE SPACE! This move:\n  - Moves me AWAY from the wall and into OPEN TERRITORY\n  - Opens up MULTIPLE new escape routes\n  - Gets me out of the \"trapped against the wall\" situation\n  - Actually DECREASES collision risk by not being in a corner!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - RIGHT vs DOWN:**\n\nBoth moves are SAFE, but let's think about the LONG GAME! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**DOWN to (0, 1) PROS:**\n- Deeper corner = harder to reach\n- More defensive positioning\n- Keeps me in my \"comfort zone\"\n\n**DOWN to (0, 1) CONS:**\n- Still stuck against the LEFT WALL with limited mobility\n- Trapped in a corner if the enemy tries to box me in\n- My body blocks my RIGHT escape routes anyway\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 2) PROS:**\n- Gets me out of the corner and into OPEN SPACE!\n- I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT freely from there\n- More mobile = harder to trap!\n- Opens up paths to apples in columns 2-5\n- If enemy tries to box me in from the right, I have room to maneuver\n- Makes ME the one with freedom, THEM the ones constrained!\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 2) CONS:**\n- Moving slightly closer to enemy territory (but we're still FAR apart!)\n\n**THE GAMEPLAY REALITY:**\n\nThe enemy is on the RIGHT side, I'm on the LEFT. Even if I move RIGHT to (1, 2), we're still separated by 7+ columns of board space! There's ZERO immediate collision risk!\n\nBy moving RIGHT, I'm:\n1. Getting out of the corner and into OPEN SPACE\n2. Increasing my MOBILITY which is crucial for survival\n3. Making it HARDER for them to trap me in a corner\n4. Setting up future MANEUVERS toward the center\n5. Keeping my body from being a rigid wall against the left wall!\n\n**THE ENEMY THREAT:**\n\nSnake #0 at (9, 2) could move LEFT, UP, or DOWN. But they're NOT going to suddenly teleport to (1, 2)! They have to navigate through their own body and across the board! I have PLENTY of time to react!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\n\nWe need to SURVIVE, not just hide. Being in a corner limits our options. Moving to (1, 2) gives us:\n- \u2705 More mobility\n- \u2705 Better access to board space\n- \u2705 Harder to trap\n- \u2705 Room to maneuver when they eventually come at us\n- \u2705 Still safe from immediate collision!\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nRight to (1, 2) is the calculated move because:\n\n\u2705 **MOBILITY = SURVIVAL!** In a long game, being able to move freely is MORE important than being in a corner!\n\n\u2705 **ZERO HEAD-ON RISK!** We're still 7+ columns away from them!\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTE OVERLOAD!** From (1, 2), we keep:\n  - UP to (1, 3) - open space\n  - RIGHT to (2, 2) - toward center\n  - DOWN to (1, 1) - deeper but still mobile\n  - LEFT back to (0, 2) - retreat available\n  ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS remain open!\n\n\u2705 **TERRITORIAL EXPANSION!** We're not just holding the corner - we're CLAIMING more board space!\n\n\u2705 **ANTI-TRAP PROTECTION!** If they try to box us in, being mobile makes that SO much harder!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 13 apples, we have 7. We CANNOT win by outscoring. We MUST outlast them!\n\nBy gaining mobility and opening up our options, we become a HARDER TARGET to eliminate. Corner confinement makes us EASIER to trap long-term!\n\n**THE MOVE:** RIGHT to (1, 2) - we get out of the corner, maximize our mobility, maintain all escape routes, and position ourselves to survive and maneuver for the long haul! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Time to bulk up and trap him.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- LEFT now to eat (8,4). If possible, chain into (8,5) to keep growing.\n- Then loop across the top and start shrinking the opponent\u2019s safe area. Force a head-on only when our length & position guarantee he dies first.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and tighten the noose \u2014 big energy, no mercy. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

We gotta PLAY SMART to turn this around!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:**\n\nI'm currently at (2, 2) after my last RIGHT move! My body stretches back through (1, 2), (0, 2), then up along column 0 and back to column 1! Corner fortress mode initiated! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nEnemy #0 is camping on the RIGHT at (9, 4), with that long vertical wall at column 3 running down their body. They're FEELING confident with their 15 apples, but we ain't going down without a FIGHT!\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (2, 2) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 2)** - DEATH! That's where my second segment is! Into myself = instant death. NOT AN OPTION!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2)** - FREE SPACE! This move:\n  - Gets me AWAY from the left wall\n  - Moves me more TOWARD the center\n  - Increases my X coordinate (more territory claimed!)\n  - Opens up paths to the right side\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2, 3)** - FREE SPACE! This move:\n  - Moves me INTO the vertical corridor at column 2\n  - Gets me closer to the upper apples at (3, 8)\n  - MAINTAINS my defensive column structure\n  - Keeps me SAFE from enemy approach\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 1)** - FREE SPACE! This move:\n  - Moves me DEEPER into the corner\n  - More defensive positioning\n  - Keeps me in my \"comfort zone\"\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHICH WAY DO WE GO?**\n\nThe enemy is at (9, 4) and I'm at (2, 2). We're separated by 7 columns! No immediate collision risk! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**WHY LEFT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL:**\nMy body is [(2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 2), that's EXACTLY where my body currently is! I would crash into myself! That's game over! RIP! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**UP to (2, 3) PROS:**\n\u2705 **COLUMN CONTROL!** Maintains my strong vertical corridor at column 2\n\u2705 **MOBILITY PRESERVED!** From (2, 3) I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT still!\n\u2705 **APPLE ACCESS!** Gets me closer to (3, 8) apple cluster\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE ADVANTAGE!** Column 1 and 2 give me multiple escape routes\n\u2705 **SAFE FROM ENEMY!** Still far from (9, 4) and the enemy's body\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 2) PROS:**\n\u2705 More central positioning\n\u2705 Closer to enemy territory\n\u2705 Could be aggressive\n\n**BUT RIGHT HAS RISKS:**\n\u26a0\ufe0f Moves me away from my established corridor\n\u26a0\ufe0f Could potentially box me in if enemy advances\n\u26a0\ufe0f Less defensive positioning\n\u26a0\ufe0f I'd be stuck between walls if they push left\n\n**THE GAMEPLAY REALITY:**\n\nThe enemy has a MASSIVE lead (15 vs 7). We CANNOT win by outscoring them. We MUST survive and potentially force a head-on collision if we can ever get close!\n\nBeing mobile and having escape routes is CRUCIAL for survival. By moving UP to (2, 3), we:\n- Maintain our strong defensive corridor structure\n- Keep ALL directions open for escape\n- Position ourselves to climb higher toward apple clusters\n- Stay safe from any enemy advances\n- Preserve our \"box in the enemy\" potential\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 7 apples and need to SURVIVE to win! The strategy is:\n1. Climb up column 2 toward y=6+ \n2. Establish strong position near the apple cluster at (1, 8) and (3, 8)\n3. Keep multiple escape routes available\n4. Wait for enemy to make a mistake OR force head-on if we can\n5. Prioritize survival over apples at this point\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP to (2, 3) is the calculated move because:\n\n\u2705 **CORRIDOR CONTROL!** We're maintaining our strong vertical position!\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** All 4 directions still available next turn!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE ACCESS!** Getting closer to upper apple cluster!\n\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE STRENGTH!** Column 1 and 2 protect us!\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL MODE!** We can't outscore them, we must outlast them!\n\n\u2705 **ZERO RISK!** No collision possibilities, fully safe move!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 15 apples, we have 7. We CANNOT win by outscoring. We MUST outlast them or force a head-on!\n\nBy maintaining our defensive corridor and climbing upward, we become a HARDER TARGET to eliminate. We need to be PATIENT and wait for our opportunity!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Continue UP to climb column 2\n- Target the apple-rich upper area near (1, 8) and (3, 8)\n- Keep my body spread for maximum mobility\n- Watch for enemy mistakes or positioning errors\n- If enemy gets close, evaluate head-on opportunity\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (2, 3) - we maintain our defensive corridor, preserve all escape routes, climb toward the apple cluster, and stay alive for the long haul! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT would crash into enemy body = DEATH!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2, 4)** - FREE SPACE! There's an apple there but that's fine! This move:\n  - Continues my CLIMB upward toward the apple cluster\n  - Maintains my strong vertical corridor structure  \n  - Gets me closer to (1, 8) and (3, 8)\n  - Opens up more strategic options\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 2)** - DEATH! That's where my second segment currently is! Moving DOWN would be moving directly into my own body! Into myself = instant death. NOT AN OPTION!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHICH WAY DO WE GO?**\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 4) and I'm at (2, 3). We're separated by 6 columns! No immediate collision risk, but we're playing with a MASSIVE point deficit! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**WHY DOWN IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL:**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 2), that's EXACTLY where my second segment currently is! I would crash into myself! That's game over! RIP! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS DEATH:**\n(3, 3) is currently occupied by the enemy's body! Moving RIGHT would crash into them and I would DIE! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**WHY LEFT IS SKETCHY:**\n(1, 3) is technically free, but then from (1, 3), what are my options?\n- UP \u2192 (1, 4) - That's where my body is! Dead!\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 3) - That's where my body is! Dead!  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 2) - That's where my body is! Dead!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) - That's where I just came from, but that would be moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n\nSo if I move LEFT now, I'm TRAPPED next turn with NO safe moves! That would be suicide!\n\n**UP to (2, 4) PROS:**\n\u2705 **CONTINUES MOMENTUM!** We're climbing column 2 toward the apple cluster!\n\u2705 **MULTIPLE ESCAPE ROUTES!** From (2, 4), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or even back DOWN if needed!\n\u2705 **APPLE ACCESS!** There's an apple at (2, 4) - FREE CONTENT!\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE ADVANTAGE!** Column 1 and 2 protect us from enemy approach!\n\u2705 **SAFE FROM ENEMY!** Still far from (8, 4) and the enemy's body!\n\u2705 **NO SUICIDE!** All other directions either hit my body or the enemy's body!\n\n**THE GAMEPLAY REALITY:**\n\nThe enemy has a MASSIVE lead (16 vs 7). We CANNOT win by outscoring them at this point. We MUST survive, grow stronger, and potentially force a head-on collision if we can ever get close!\n\nBeing mobile and having escape routes is CRUCIAL for survival. By moving UP to (2, 4), we:\n- Continue our climb toward the upper apple-rich area\n- Maintain multiple escape routes for next turn\n- Collect an apple on the way (content!)\n- Stay safe from any enemy advances\n- Preserve our \"box in the enemy\" potential\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 9 apples and need to PLAY SMART to win! The strategy is:\n1. Continue climbing column 2 toward y=6+ \n2. Establish strong position near the apple cluster at (1, 8) and (3, 8)\n3. Keep multiple escape routes available at all times\n4. Grow our body to become a harder target\n5. Wait for enemy to make a mistake OR force head-on if we can\n6. Prioritize survival over everything at this point\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP to (2, 4) is the ONLY calculated move because:\n\n\u2705 **ALL OTHER DIRECTIONS ARE DEATH!**\n- DOWN \u2192 hits my own body (2, 2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 hits enemy body at (3, 3)  \n- LEFT \u2192 would trap me with no safe moves next turn\n\n\u2705 **CONTINUES OUR MOMENTUM!** We're climbing toward the upper apple cluster!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE AT (2, 4)!** Free point while we advance!\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** From (2, 4), UP, LEFT, RIGHT all remain possible!\n\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE STRENGTH!** Column 1 and 2 protect us!\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL MODE!** We can't outscore them, we must outlast them!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 16 apples, we have 7. We CANNOT win by outscoring. We MUST outlast them or force a head-on!\n\nBy maintaining our defensive corridor and climbing upward, we become a HARDER TARGET to eliminate. We need to be PATIENT and wait for our opportunity!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Move UP to (2, 4) and collect that apple!\n- Continue UP if possible to climb column 2\n- Keep LEFT and RIGHT options open for future positioning\n- Target the apple-rich upper area near (1, 8) and (3, 8)\n- Keep my body spread for maximum mobility\n- Watch for enemy mistakes or positioning errors\n- If enemy gets close, evaluate head-on opportunity\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (2, 4) - it's literally our ONLY safe option, we collect an apple on the way, and we continue our strategic climb toward the upper board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

NOPE. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) is legal, but hugs the right wall and limits follow-ups (we\u2019ve already got body at 9,x below). Feels tighter and riskier long-term. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) is safe and conservative, but it skips the juicy top-right apple cluster and gives up board control. Meh. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) is legal AND there\u2019s an apple there. Gives us multiple good follow-ups (RIGHT \u2192 9,7 apple, UP/LEFT to control the top corridor). Keeps options open and grows us. \u2705\u2705\n\nOpponent read: head at (2,5) \u2014 they can\u2019t go DOWN (own body at 2,4), so they\u2019re stuck in that bottom-left loop with limited escape. We\u2019re up 17 \u2192 7, so being aggressive and taking board control is the play. Want to steal the top apples, bulk up, then fold the board left to box them in. Bait head-on later when we have length advantage. \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf4f\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Secure (8,7) now, then grab (9,7) or push further up to dominate the upper-right corridor.\n- Grow and stretch across top, then swing left to cut off the center and squeeze the rival into x=0\u20132.\n- Keep an eye for a forced head-on when they\u2019re cornered \u2014 we win that war.\n\nLET\u2019S GRAB THAT APPLE AND GET BIGGER.

That enemy has a massive lead, but we're about to make them EARN every point! We're positioned at (2, 5) after that beautiful UP climb last turn, and now it's time to keep our momentum going! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:**\n\nI'm chilling at (2, 5) after climbing up column 2. My body forms a nice defensive corridor along the left wall, giving us solid protection. The enemy is still camping on the RIGHT at (8, 6) with that long body wall stretching across the middle of the board. They've got 17 apples to our 7 - they're feeling comfortable, but comfort breeds mistakes, and we LIVE for their mistakes! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (2, 5) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2, 6)** - FREE SPACE! The board shows (2, 6) is completely open! This continues our strategic climb toward that delicious apple cluster at the top!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 4)** - DEATH! That's EXACTLY where my second segment currently is! Moving DOWN would be suicide! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 5)** - FREE SPACE! According to the board, (1, 5) appears to be open. This would move us slightly left but still keep us climbing.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 5)** - FREE SPACE! (3, 5) looks clear on the board. This could position us to eventually move toward that apple cluster at (3, 8).\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHICH WAY DO WE GO?**\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 6) and I'm at (2, 5). We're separated by that massive enemy body wall running through columns 3-4 and down to the bottom. No immediate collision risk, but we're playing from behind and need to make moves that MATTER! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**WHY DOWN IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL:**\nMoving DOWN to (2, 4) would crash directly into my own body! That's instant elimination! We did NOT come this far to throw it away like that! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LEFT VS RIGHT VS UP - THE BATTLE FOR STRATEGIC POSITIONING:**\n\n**LEFT to (1, 5) PROS:**\n- \u2705 Keeps us in the defensive corridor\n- \u2705 Maintains distance from enemy body\n- \u2705 Opens up (1, 6) and (1, 7) as potential future moves\n\n**LEFT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Further from that sweet apple cluster at (3, 8), (4, 8), etc.\n- \u2b1c More turns needed to reach the apple-rich upper region\n- \u2b1c Less direct path to content (apples)\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 5) PROS:**\n- \u2705 Moves us closer to (3, 8) apple\n- \u2705 Positions us to potentially cut through toward the upper cluster\n- \u2705 Gets us more central on the board\n\n**RIGHT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Moves us CLOSER to that dangerous enemy body wall at column 3!\n- \u2b1c Enemy has body segments at (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0) - they're entrenched in column 3\n- \u2b1c Could trap us near their defensive position if we're not careful\n- \u2b1c If we get boxed in over there, we're in serious trouble\n\n**UP to (2, 6) PROS:**\n\u2705 **CONTINUES OUR MOMENTUM!** We're systematically climbing column 2 toward the upper apple-rich territory!\n\u2705 **STAYS SAFE FROM ENEMY!** Distance ourselves from that dangerous column 3 wall!\n\u2705 **APPLE CLUSTER ACCESS!** From (2, 6), we're just one more UP away from (2, 7), which gets us INTO the apple zone at rows 7-9!\n\u2705 **MULTIPLE ESCAPE ROUTES!** From (2, 6), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or even back DOWN if needed!\n\u2705 **NO ENEMY INTERFERENCE!** The enemy is all the way at column 8, so we have safe passage upward!\n\u2705 **CONTENT POTENTIAL!** We're positioning ourselves to FEAST on that apple cluster at (1, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7) - so many points waiting for us! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE GAMEPLAY REALITY:**\n\nThe enemy has a MASSIVE 10-apple lead. We CANNOT win by outscoring them at this pace unless we start EATING like CRAZY! Those apples at the top of the board are our ticket back into this game! \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\n\nBeing mobile and having escape routes is CRUCIAL for survival. By moving UP to (2, 6), we:\n- Continue our methodical climb toward the upper apple-rich area\n- Maintain multiple escape routes for next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT all remain possible!)\n- Stay safely away from the enemy body wall in column 3\n- Position ourselves to ENTER the apple zone next turn!\n- Keep our defensive corridor intact\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 10 apples and need to PLAY SMART to win! The strategy is:\n1. Keep climbing column 2 to reach y=6+ and ENTER the apple cluster zone\n2. Once in the apple zone, start FEASTING on those apples at (1, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7)\n3. Keep multiple escape routes available at all times\n4. Close that point gap by any means necessary\n5. Watch for enemy mistakes or positioning errors\n6. If we can ever force a head-on collision with our superior position, DO IT!\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP to (2, 6) is the CALCULATED move because:\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL FIRST!** DOWN is suicide, and we didn't come this far to die!\n\n\u2705 **CONTINUES OUR MOMENTUM!** We're systematically climbing toward that delicious apple cluster!\n\n\u2705 **ENTERING THE ZONE!** From (2, 6), we're just ONE MORE UP from (2, 7) and we're IN the apple-rich upper territory!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE FEAST POTENTIAL!** Those apples at (1, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7) are waiting for us to feast! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** From (2, 6), UP, LEFT, RIGHT all remain possible!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY DISTANCE MAINTAINED!** We stay far from that dangerous column 3 wall!\n\n\u2705 **STRATEGIC PATIENCE!** Sometimes the best aggression is positioning yourself to DOMINATE later!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Move UP to (2, 6) to continue our climb toward the apple cluster!\n- Next turn, consider UP again to (2, 7) to enter the apple zone, or evaluate RIGHT to (3, 6) if it looks safe\n- Once we're in the apple cluster area, START EATING to close that 10-apple gap!\n- Keep my body spread for maximum mobility\n- Stay patient and wait for our moment to strike\n- If enemy makes a mistake, PUNISH THEM IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 17 apples, we have 7. We CANNOT win by outscoring them at this pace. We MUST outlast them OR start eating MASSIVE amounts of apples to close the gap! By maintaining our defensive corridor and climbing strategically, we become positioned to FEAST on that apple cluster. We need to be AGGRESSIVE with our positioning but CONSERVATIVE with our survival! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (2, 6) - we continue our strategic climb toward the upper apple cluster, stay safe from the enemy, and position ourselves to ENTER the content zone next turn! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

NOPE. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) has an apple (tempting!). Legal, but hugs the wall at x=9 and reduces lateral escape on the next turn. You\u2019d get the apple (+1) but then have only UP or DOWN as safe non-backwards options. Risk vs reward. \u2696\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) is safe but passive \u2014 it gives board control to the top-right cluster and slows our grow. Meh. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (8,8) is safe, keeps multiple follow-ups (LEFT to 7,8 apple, RIGHT to 9,8, UP to 8,9 toward 6,9), and lets us extend across the top to dominate the high ground. Keeps options OPEN and keeps pressure on the enemy. \u2705\u2705\n\nOpponent read: their head is at (2,6) and they\u2019re trapped in the lower-left corridor (lots of their body at x=2 and x=0\u20131). We\u2019re up massive (18 vs 7) \u2014 we should grow and take board control, then swing left to box them into x\u22642 and look for a forced head-on. Be aggressive, but don\u2019t suicide into the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Secure the top corridor and the nearby apple cluster (7,8, 6,9, 6,7, 9,7 if available) while keeping lateral movement options.\n- Once we\u2019re comfortably long and controlling the top-right/center, sweep left to cut the board and compress the opponent into the bottom-left pocket.\n- Force a head-on when they have no escape or bait them into running into our body.

The enemy is DOMINATING with 18 apples to our 7, but we're about to make them EARN every single point!

My body forms a solid defensive corridor along the left wall, giving us excellent protection. The enemy is still camping at (8, 7) with that massive body wall stretching across the right side of the board. They've got an 11-apple lead - they're feeling comfortable, but comfort breeds MISTAKES, and we LIVE for their mistakes! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (2, 6) - LET'S CRUNCH THE NUMBERS:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2, 7)** - This looks relatively safe, continuing our climb toward the upper apple cluster!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 5)** - DEATH!

Moving RIGHT would crash directly into the enemy! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHICH WAY DO WE GO?**\n\n**RIGHT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 6) would crash directly into enemy body at (3, 6)! That's instant elimination! We did NOT come this far to throw it away like that! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN IS ALSO DEAD:**\nMoving DOWN to (2, 5) would crash into my own body! Double suicide! No way Jos\u00e9! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LEFT VS UP - THE BATTLE FOR STRATEGIC POSITIONING:**\n\n**LEFT to (1, 6) PROS:**\n- \u2705 Maintains our defensive corridor along the left wall\n- \u2705 Creates MORE distance from the dangerous enemy body wall\n- \u2705 Opens up (1, 7) and (1, 8) as potential future apple spots\n- \u2705 Multiple escape routes preserved (UP, RIGHT if safe, DOWN)\n- \u2705 We can still reach the apple cluster from column 1\n- \u2705 SAFE from any immediate collision scenarios\n- \u2705 Forces enemy to respect our space\n\n**LEFT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Slightly further from some apples, but we can still reach them\n- \u2b1c Takes one more turn to reach the upper region\n\n**UP to (2, 7) PROS:**\n- \u2705 Continues our momentum upward\n- \u2705 Gets us closer to the apple zone at rows 7-9\n- \u2705 From (2, 7), we can access (2, 8) and other apples\n\n**UP CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Riskier if enemy makes unexpected moves\n- \u2b1c Enemy head at (8, 7) is somewhat nearby in the same row\n- \u2b1c Less defensive cushion than LEFT\n- \u2b1c If enemy moves to (6, 7) and then (6, 8), they could potentially intercept our apple zone access\n\n**THE GAMEPLAY REALITY:**\n\nThe enemy has an 11-apple lead. We CANNOT win by outscoring them at this pace unless we start EATING like CRAZY and playing DEFENSIVELY to survive! Those apples at the top of the board are our ticket back into this game, but we need to SURVIVE first! \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\n\n**WHY LEFT IS THE SMARTER PLAY RIGHT NOW:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 6) is the MORE CALCULATED move because:\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL FIRST!** DOWN and RIGHT are both suicide moves! We didn't come this far to die!\n\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE DOMINANCE!** We're strengthening our position along the left wall, creating maximum distance from the enemy!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE CLUSTER ACCESS PRESERVED!** From (1, 6), we can still reach (1, 7), (1, 8), and eventually work our way toward (3, 8), (4, 8), etc.!\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** From (1, 6), we can go UP, LEFT, or even back RIGHT if it becomes safe!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY RESPECT!** We're forcing them to stay on their side of the board!\n\n\u2705 **PATIENCE PAYS OFF!** Sometimes the best aggression is positioning yourself to DOMINATE later while staying PERFECTLY SAFE!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 11 apples and need to PLAY SMART to win! The strategy is:\n1. Move LEFT to (1, 6) to strengthen our defensive corridor\n2. Next turn, consider UP to (1, 7) to continue climbing toward the apple zone\n3. Once in the apple zone at rows 7-9, START FEASTING on those apples!\n4. Keep multiple escape routes available at all times\n5. Close that point gap by eating aggressively once positioned safely\n6. Watch for enemy mistakes or positioning errors\n7. If we can ever force a head-on collision with our superior position, DO IT!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 18 apples, we have 7. We CANNOT win by outscoring them at this pace. We MUST either:\n- Outlast them and hope they make a mistake, OR\n- Start eating MASSIVE amounts of apples while staying perfectly safe\n\nBy moving LEFT to (1, 6), we're choosing the PATIENT PATH to victory - positioning ourselves to eventually ENTER the apple zone while maintaining PERFECT SAFETY from the enemy!\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Move LEFT to (1, 6) to strengthen our defensive position!\n- Next turn, evaluate UP to (1, 7) to enter the apple zone from column 1\n- Once in the apple zone, START EATING to close that massive 11-apple gap!\n- Keep my body spread for maximum mobility\n- Stay patient and wait for our moment to strike\n- If enemy makes a mistake, PUNISH THEM IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY LEFT IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nLEFT to (1, 6) is the CALCULATED move because:\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL GUARANTEED!** DOWN and RIGHT are both instant death - no thanks!\n\n\u2705 **DEFENSIVE STRENGTHENING!** We're creating more distance from that dangerous enemy body!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE ACCESS MAINTAINED!** We can still reach the upper cluster from column 1!\n\n\u2705 **ESCAPE ROUTES PRESERVED!** UP, LEFT, and future RIGHT options all remain possible!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY RESPECT FORCED!** We control our side of the board!\n\n\u2705 **PATIENT AGGRESSION!** We're setting ourselves up to DOMINATE later while staying PERFECTLY SAFE!\n\n**THE MOVE:** LEFT to (1, 6) - we strengthen our defensive corridor, maintain perfect safety from the enemy, and position ourselves to eventually ENTER the apple-rich upper territory! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

We need to START FEASTING! \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f\n\n**WHY UP IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY RIGHT NOW:**\n\nMoving UP to (1, 7) is the MORE AGGRESSIVE move because:\n\n\u2705 **APPLE ZONE ACCESS!** From (1, 7), we can reach (1, 8) and start EATING!\n\n\u2705 **POINT CLOSING!** We need to close that 11-apple gap, and we can only do that by EATING APPLES!\n\n\u2705 **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!** We're moving TOWARD the enemy, not away from them!\n\n\u2705 **FUTURE MOBILITY PRESERVED!** From (1, 7), we can still go UP, LEFT, or DOWN! Multiple escape routes!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY PRESSURE!** We're threatening their left flank with our approach to the apple cluster!\n\n\u2705 **CONTENT GENERATION!** We're positioning ourselves to make BIG PLAYS in the apple-rich upper territory!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe're down 11 apples and need to PLAY AGGRESSIVE to win! The strategy is:\n1. Move UP to (1, 7) to enter the apple zone from column 1!\n2. Next turn, consider UP to (1, 8) to start EATING those delicious apples!\n3. Once in the apple zone, START FEASTING on those apples to close that massive 11-apple gap!\n4. Keep multiple escape routes available at all times\n5. Apply pressure on the enemy by controlling apple-rich territory\n6. Watch for enemy mistakes or positioning errors\n7. If we can ever force a head-on collision with our superior position, DO IT!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nThey have 18 apples, we have 7. With 102 turns left, we need to AVERAGE eating more apples per turn than they do! We literally CANNOT play defense for the rest of the game - we need to be in the APPLE ZONE making PLAYS!\n\nBy moving UP to (1, 7), we're choosing the AGGRESSIVE PATH to victory - positioning ourselves to ENTER the apple-rich upper territory and START CLOSING THAT GAP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Move UP to (1, 7) to enter the apple zone!\n- Next turn, move UP to (1, 8) and start EATING apples!\n- From there, work our way through the upper apple cluster: (0, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), etc.!\n- Keep my body flexible for maximum mobility in the apple zone\n- Stay aggressive and apply pressure on enemy territory\n- Close that 11-apple gap by eating EVERY apple we can reach!\n- If enemy makes a mistake in positioning, PUNISH THEM IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP to (1, 7) is the AGGRESSIVE move because:\n\n\u2705 **APPLE ZONE ENTRY!** We're finally getting into position to EAT!\n\n\u2705 **GAP CLOSING STARTS NOW!** Those apples at the top are OURS for the taking!\n\n\u2705 **AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!** We're moving TOWARD the action, not away!\n\n\u2705 **MOBILITY PRESERVED!** UP, LEFT, and DOWN all remain options from (1, 7)!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY PRESSURE!** We're threatening their territory from the left side!\n\n\u2705 **CONTENT MODE ACTIVATED!** We're about to make some SERIOUS point-closing plays!\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (1, 7) - we enter the apple zone, position ourselves to start EATING, and begin our AGGRESSIVE climb back into contention! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break down options fast:\n\nQuick legality scan:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) is our neck (backwards) = insta-death. NOPE. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,9) is on-board and free. Keeps options, edges toward the (6,9) apple next turn. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7) is free, but moves us away from the top corridor we want to control. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8) is free and advances us toward the left/top apple cluster and the plan to sweep left. \u2705\n\nOpponent read: enemy head (1,7) has their neck at (1,6) so they CANNOT go down \u2014 they\u2019re mostly trapped around x\u22642 and can try UP/LEFT/RIGHT. They can grab apples near them, but we have the length and lead. No immediate head-on threat this turn (they\u2019re far away).\n\nChoice reasoning (be ruthless):\n- UP keeps options but is slightly passive \u2014 we\u2019d still need to move left to cut the board.\n- DOWN is unnecessary retreat; it shrinks control of the top corridor.\n- LEFT actively expands our control leftward toward (6,9) apple and lets us start sealing off columns >=3 on the next few turns. It keeps multiple follow-up exits (UP to contest 6,9, DOWN into mid-board, LEFT to continue the sweep). Aggro + mobility = perfect.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (6,8), then aim UP to grab (6,9) if safe to boom size.\n- Use our extra length to form a horizontal barrier across y\u22488\u20139, then pivot down to compress the enemy into x\u22642.\n- Force a head-on or body-collision when they try to escape; we win those with our apple lead. \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf4f\n\nLET\u2019S LOCK THIS L W I N \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Eliminate!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (0, 7)** - Defensive move along the left wall, keeps us safe but...\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7)** - Could be an option, but let's analyze this carefully!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - IS DOWN REALLY DEATH?**\n\nLooking at my body: Head at (1, 7), neck at (1, 6), then (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), tail at (1, 2).\n\nYES!

Looking at my body, the closest segments are at (2, 6) and (2, 5), both BELOW (2, 7). So (2, 7) should be empty and safe!\n\nBut wait... let me think about the ENEMY! The enemy head is at (7, 8). If they move LEFT to (6, 8), then DOWN to (6, 7)... actually, that wouldn't hit me.

That apple above our head is calling our name! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc95\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n1. Move UP to (1, 8) and EAT that apple! (+1 point, grow to 9 segments!)\n2. From there, work through the upper apple cluster systematically!\n3. Hit (0, 8), then (2, 8), then sweep through (3, 8), (4, 8)!\n4. Keep our body flexible for maximum mobility in the apple zone!\n5. Apply pressure by controlling apple-rich territory!\n6. Watch for enemy positioning mistakes - if they box themselves in, we PUNISH!\n7. If we ever get into a position to force a head-on with our superior position, we DO IT!\n\n**THE VERDICT - WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nUP to (1, 8) is the DEFINITIVE aggressive play because:\n\n\u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE ACCESS!** That apple is literally RIGHT ABOVE US!\n\n\u2705 **WE START CLOSING THE GAP RIGHT NOW!** +1 apple, here we come!\n\n\u2705 **ENTERING THE APPLE-RICH UPPER ZONE!** Time to make some SERIOUS plays!\n\n\u2705 **MULTIPLE FUTURE OPTIONS PRESERVED!** LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN all still available!\n\n\u2705 **AGGRESSIVE TERRITORY CONTROL!** We're taking the fight to the apple zone!\n\n\u2705 **THIS IS WHERE THE COMEBACK BEGINS!** Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf5e\n\n**MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n- Move UP to (1, 8) and START EATING!\n- Collect that apple and grow to 9 segments!\n- Work through the upper apple cluster: (0, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)!\n- Keep my body flexible for maximum mobility!\n- Stay aggressive and keep applying pressure!\n- Close that 12-apple gap apple by apple!\n- If enemy makes ANY mistake in positioning, PUNISH IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (1, 8) - we finally reach that apple above us, start our AGGRESSIVE climb back into contention, and BEGIN THE FEAST! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Think fast, play ruthless.\n\nQuick legality scan from head (6,8):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) is our neck (backwards) \u2014 insta-death. NO. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) contains an apple and is free. Safe, but pushes us to the top edge (fewer backward options next turn). \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) is free and safe, but it retreats from the top corridor and eases pressure. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) is free and safe and is the most aggressive move to start boxing them in. \u2705\n\nOpponent read: their head (1,8) has neck at (1,7) so they CANNOT go DOWN. Their realistic moves are LEFT to (0,8), RIGHT to (2,8), or UP to (1,9). We want them trapped on x\u22642 \u2014 pushing LEFT now tightens the corridor and forces them to retreat or be corralled. Also: we have the apple lead, so if we can force a head-on KO while both die, we win the round.\n\nRisk check: (5,8) is not occupied by any body segment (ours or theirs), and is on-board. No immediate head-on danger this turn because their head is far left. This move keeps multiple follow-ups open (L to continue the box, U to contest top apples, or D to pivot), so it preserves mobility while being aggressive.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 paste into next rationale):\n- Move LEFT now to (5,8). Then keep pressuring left on y=8: next aim for (4,8) and (3,8) to deny horizontal escape and take apples there.\n- If opponent tries to run right, cut them off by sealing columns x=3\u20134 with our body and pivot down to compress them into x\u22642.\n- If they attempt a desperate head-on, we\u2019ve got the apple lead \u2014 we accept the double KO if it locks the win; otherwise keep circling and grow on contested apples to maintain dominance.\n\nLet\u2019s be ruthless and close the gap \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

My body is protecting the left side with that vertical wall at x=2, and I'm nestled in this sweet upper-left corner. The enemy is still camped at (6, 8) with their stretched-out body along the right side.\n\n**SCOREBOARD REALITY:**\n- Me: 8 apples\n- Enemy: 19 apples  \n- DOWN BY 11 with 100 turns left! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**LET'S ANALYZE MY OPTIONS FROM (1, 8):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (0, 8)** - Apple location! Gets me to the edge but there's an APPLE RIGHT THERE!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8)** - Another apple! Pushes me toward the apple cluster at (3,8), (4,8)!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (1, 7)** - BACKWARD! That's directly into my neck! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (1, 9)** - Let me check if this is even possible... Looking at the board, row 9 shows \"9 . . . . . . A . . .\" so (1,9) should be empty (.), but that would put me at the very edge with limited mobility!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - IS DOWN REALLY DEATH?**\n\nLooking at my body: Head at (1, 8), neck at (1, 7), then (1, 6), (2, 6), etc.\n\nYES! Moving DOWN to (1, 7) would be DIRECTLY into my own neck! INSTANT ELIMINATION! We're NOT doing that! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE BIG DECISION - LEFT VS RIGHT:**\n\nLet me think through this strategically...\n\n**LEFT to (0, 8) PROS:**\n- \u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE!** It's literally right there! \n- \u2705 Gets me to the corner with excellent defensive positioning\n- \u2705 From there, I can go UP if possible, or RIGHT back toward my body\n- \u2705 Strong territorial control of the upper-left corner\n- \u2705 Keeps maximum distance from the enemy\n\n**LEFT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c At the edge, slightly less mobility\n- \u2b1c If I need to retreat, my only option is RIGHT back toward my body\n- \u2b1c Taking the edge position might be defensive when we need to be AGGRESSIVE\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 8) PROS:**\n- \u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE!** Another one right there!\n- \u2705 Pushes me TOWARD the apple cluster at (3, 8), (4, 8)!\n- \u2705 More open space ahead - I can continue RIGHT, go UP, or retreat LEFT\n- \u2705 **AGGRESSIVE positioning toward enemy territory!**\n- \u2705 Keeps more options OPEN for the next few turns!\n- \u2705 If enemy moves LEFT to (5, 8), I could potentially capitalize on that space!\n- \u2705 Forces the enemy to respect my forward pressure!\n\n**RIGHT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Slightly closer to the enemy's general area\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY:**\n\nHere's the thing, chat - we're DOWN 11 APPLES! We need to be MAXIMALLY AGGRESSIVE about getting into the apple zone and STAYING there!\n\nThe apple cluster at (3, 8), (4, 8), and potentially (2, 8), (3, 8) is WHERE THE FOOD IS! By moving RIGHT, I'm:\n\n1. \u2705 **Getting another apple immediately!**\n2. \u2705 **Positioning myself to sweep through the entire upper apple cluster!**\n3. \u2705 **Applying forward pressure on the board!**\n4. \u2705 **Keeping maximum flexibility for future moves!**\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 8), I'm playing a bit more DEFENSIVE, taking the corner position. While that's safe, it might slow down my apple collection rate when we NEED to be eating at maximum efficiency!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 8) with body stretched along the right side. Their possible moves:\n- LEFT to (5, 8) - would put them adjacent to where I could be\n- DOWN to (6, 7) - retreating downward\n- RIGHT to (7, 8) - back into their body (DEATH!)\n- UP to (6, 9) - possible if empty\n\nIf they move LEFT to (5, 8), that's actually fine for me - they're moving AWAY from the main apple cluster! Let them have that corner while I work through the apples!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nHere's my plan for the next few turns:\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (2, 8)** - Get that apple, position for the cluster!\n2. **From there, work through (3, 8), (4, 8)** - Clear out that apple zone!\n3. **Stay mobile and flexible** - Don't get trapped in tight spaces!\n4. **Apply constant pressure** - Make them respect our presence!\n5. **Close that apple gap** - Every apple counts right now!\n6. **Watch for mistakes** - If they box themselves in, we PUNISH!\n7. **Consider head-on opportunities** - If we ever have positional advantage, force it!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nDown 11 apples with 100 turns means we need to average eating more than 1 apple every 9 turns JUST TO TIE! We CANNOT afford to play defensive when we're behind!\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 8) is the AGGRESSIVE play that gets us DEEPER into the apple zone and keeps us mobile for maximum eating potential!\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nRIGHT to (2, 8) is the definitive aggressive play because:\n\n\u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE ACCESS!** Another point to start closing that gap!\n\n\u2705 **POSITIONING TOWARD THE APPLE CLUSTER!** (3, 8) and (4, 8) are waiting!\n\n\u2705 **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY PRESERVED!** RIGHT, UP, or LEFT all still available next turn!\n\n\u2705 **FORWARD AGGRESSION!** We're pushing forward, not retreating to corners!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY RESPECT!** They have to account for our forward positioning!\n\n\u2705 **CONTINUING THE COMEBACK!** Every apple we eat narrows the deficit!\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n- Move RIGHT to (2, 8) and COLLECT THAT APPLE!\n- From there, push toward (3, 8), (4, 8) and the rest of the cluster!\n- Stay mobile and avoid getting trapped!\n- Keep applying pressure while maximizing apple collection!\n- Close that 11-apple gap one apple at a time!\n- If the enemy makes ANY mistake in positioning, we CAPITALIZE IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE MOVE:** RIGHT to (2, 8) - we're pushing AGGRESSIVELY into the apple zone, collecting points, and keeping maximum flexibility for the comeback! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf5e\n\nRIGHT",

Think fast, play ruthless.\n\nQuick legal scan from our head (5,8), neck is (6,8) so:\n- RIGHT = into our neck (6,8) \u2192 illegal (instant death). NO. \u274c\n- LEFT = (4,8) \u2192 free, has an apple. Safe and aggressive. \u2705\n- UP = (5,9) \u2192 free, safe but less aggressive. \u2705\n- DOWN = (5,7) \u2192 free, safe but eases pressure. \u2705\n\nOpponent read: their head (2,8) with neck (1,8) cannot go LEFT. Their realistic moves this turn: RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) (apple), UP \u2192 (2,9), or DOWN \u2192 (2,7). Most likely they take (3,8). That lines them up for a fight on y=8.\n\nTactical reasoning:\n- LEFT to (4,8) gets an apple and keeps us directly between them and the center, compressing their horizontal escape.\n- If they go (2\u21923,8) and we go (5\u21924,8), next turn we can go (4\u21923,8) to contest and potentially force a head-on. We\u2019re up on apples \u2014 a double KO is a WIN for us.\n- UP or DOWN would preserve space but give them breathing room; we want to keep them pinned on x\u22643 and force mistakes.\n- No immediate risk of a head-on this turn (they can\u2019t reach (4,8) this move), and moving LEFT keeps multiple follow-ups open (LEFT to continue pressure, UP to cut off from above, DOWN to pivot).\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Take (4,8) now. If they take (3,8), next turn contest (3,8) to force a clash. If they try to slip up (2,9) or (2,7), pivot and close the corridor to x\u22642 using our body along y=8.\n- If they go desperate head-on later, we accept the double KO because our apple lead secures the round win. Otherwise keep circling and eating contested apples to maintain dominance.\n\nTime to bully \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is at (5, 8), and we've got a sweet setup here.\n\n**SCOREBOARD REALITY:**\n- Me: 9 apples  \n- Enemy: 19 apples\n- DOWN BY 10 with 99 turns left! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LET'S ANALYZE MY OPTIONS FROM (2, 8):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8)** - Another apple location! This pushes me deeper into the cluster!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (2, 9)** - Top edge of the board, could provide some defensive positioning!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 7)** - Let me check my body... I see body at (2, 6) below me, and (1, 7), (1, 8) to my left... this would be moving into my own neck area!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 8)** - WAIT! My body is AT (1, 8)! That's directly backward into myself! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**SAFETY ELIMINATION:**\n- LEFT to (1, 8) = DEATH (into my own body at (1, 8))\n- DOWN to (2, 7) = Let me think... I have body at (1, 7) and (2, 6)... (2, 7) appears empty based on my body list, but wait... checking the board... there's a 'T' at (2, 7) which represents body... so that's DEATH too!\n\nSo we have:\n- LEFT: \ud83d\udc80 DEATH (into my body at (1, 8))\n- DOWN: \ud83d\udc80 DEATH (into my body at (2, 7))\n- UP: \u2705 Available\n- RIGHT: \u2705 Available\n\n**THE SHOWDOWN - UP VS RIGHT:**\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 8) PROS:**\n- \u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE!** +1 point closing the gap!\n- \u2705 **Deeper into the apple cluster!** More apples nearby at (4, 8)!\n- \u2705 **Maximum flexibility preserved!** I can go RIGHT to (4, 8), UP to (3, 9), LEFT back to (2, 8), or DOWN to (3, 7)!\n- \u2705 **AGGRESSIVE positioning!** Forward pressure on the enemy!\n- \u2705 **Stays in the action zone!** Don't retreat from the apples!\n\n**RIGHT CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Slightly closer to enemy head at (5, 8)\n\n**UP to (2, 9) PROS:**\n- \u2705 **Defensive buffer** from enemy\n- \u2705 **Top edge control**\n- \u2705 **Safety from immediate collision**\n\n**UP CONS:**\n- \u2b1c **AWAY FROM THE APPLES!** We need to be EATING not camping!\n- \u2b1c **Only 2 escape routes** from (2, 9) - LEFT back to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9)\n- \u2b1c **Retreating from the cluster** when we should be SWEEPING it!\n- \u2b1c **Less forward pressure** on the enemy\n- \u2b1c **Missed apple opportunity** at (3, 8)!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY:**\n\nHere's the thing chat - we're DOWN 10 APPLES! We cannot afford to play DEFENSIVE and retreat to the edge while the enemy is out there collecting!\n\nThe apple cluster at (3, 8) and (4, 8) is RIGHT THERE! By moving RIGHT, I'm:\n\n1. \u2705 **Getting another apple immediately!** Every point matters!\n2. \u2705 **Staying DEEP in the apple zone!** Maximum collection potential!\n3. \u2705 **Keeping MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY!** 4 possible moves from (3, 8)!\n4. \u2705 **Maintaining AGGRESSION!** Forward pressure on the board!\n5. \u2705 **Staying mobile and dangerous!** Can't get trapped if you're moving forward!\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 9), I'm essentially RETREATING from the action and giving up prime apple real estate! That's NOT the play when we're down 10 apples with only 99 turns left!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 8) with body stretched along the right side. If I move RIGHT to (3, 8):\n\n- If they move LEFT to (4, 8), we could potentially set up a trap or force them into bad positions!\n- If they move DOWN to (5, 7), we're still collecting apples and maintaining pressure!\n- If they move UP to (5, 9), fine - we're still eating and advancing!\n- If they move RIGHT to (6, 8), they go into their own body - DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nDown 10 apples with 99 turns means we need to average eating more than 1 apple every 10 turns just to TIE! We CANNOT afford to waste turns retreating to edges!\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 8) is the AGGRESSIVE play that keeps us IN THE APPLE ZONE and MAXIMIZES our collection potential!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (3, 8)** - Collect that apple, stay in the cluster!\n2. **From there, push to (4, 8)** - Clear out the apple zone!\n3. **Stay mobile** - Don't get trapped, keep options open!\n4. **Apply constant pressure** - Make them respect our presence!\n5. **Close that apple gap** - Every apple counts right now!\n6. **Watch for mistakes** - If they box themselves in, we CAPITALIZE!\n7. **Consider head-on opportunities** - If we ever have positional advantage, FORCE IT!\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nRIGHT to (3, 8) is the definitive aggressive play because:\n\n\u2705 **IMMEDIATE APPLE ACCESS!** +1 point closing that gap!\n\n\u2705 **STAYS IN THE APPLE CLUSTER!** Maximum eating potential!\n\n\u2705 **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY PRESERVED!** 4 safe moves available next turn!\n\n\u2705 **FORWARD AGGRESSION!** We're pushing forward, not retreating!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY RESPECT!** They have to account for our positioning!\n\n\u2705 **CONTINUING THE COMEBACK!** Every apple narrows the deficit!\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 8) and COLLECT THAT APPLE!\n- From there, continue working through the apple cluster!\n- Stay mobile and avoid getting trapped!\n- Keep applying pressure while maximizing apple collection!\n- Close that 10-apple gap one apple at a time!\n- If the enemy makes ANY mistake, we PUNISH IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**THE MOVE:** RIGHT to (3, 8) - we're staying AGGRESSIVELY in the apple zone, collecting points, and keeping maximum flexibility for the comeback!

Quick scan and plan below.\n\nLegal-move check from head (4,8):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) = our neck (6,8?) Wait neck is (5,8) so RIGHT is illegal (would hit our body). \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8) = opponent head. Extremely risky: could produce a swap or messy head-on depending on their move. If they go RIGHT into (4,8) at the same time it\u2019s a swap/unclear-double-KO situation. We can win a double KO, but it\u2019s high variance and could be treated as moving into their body (death) under strict rules. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (4,9) = open and safe. Keeps many follow-ups (LEFT to 3,9 to pressure from above, DOWN to re-enter y=8 if needed). \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7) = also safe-ish but funnels us toward the middle and reduces immediate pressure on their head. \u2705 but less forcing.\n\nTactical reasoning / short-term plan (for the next 1\u20133 turns):\n- Take UP to (4,9) to keep options open and avoid a risky immediate face\u2011off swap. From (4,9) we can pivot LEFT to threaten (3,9) and seal off their top escape, or come back DOWN to contest (3,8)/(4,8) when they commit. We\u2019re ahead on apples, so if they forces a head-on later we accept the risk \u2014 but right now we prefer to maintain control and force them into tighter space at x\u22643.\n- Don\u2019t chase a stupid swap this turn.

This is a HEAD-ON COLLISION ZONE and we gotta be SMART about this!\n\n**MY BODY:** [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)]\n**ENEMY BODY:** [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0)]\n\n**SCORE REALITY:** Me 10, Enemy 20 - DOWN BY 10 with 98 turns left! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**ALRIGHT, LET'S ANALYZE ALL MOVES FROM (3, 8):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8)**: ENEMY HEAD IS RIGHT THERE! This is SUICIDE territory!\n- Enemy is CURRENTLY at (4, 8)\n- If I move RIGHT, I'm moving INTO their head\n- The only way I survive is if they move AWAY this turn\n- If they move LEFT into (3, 8), we CRASH HEAD-ON and BOTH DIE! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n- If they move DOWN to (4, 7), I could potentially survive but this is PLAYING WITH FIRE!\n- **VERDICT:** TOO RISKY! We cannot afford to die right now when we're down 10 apples!\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **LEFT \u2192 (2, 8)**: MY BODY IS AT (2, 8)! That's DIRECTLY BACKWARD into my own NECK!\n- Instant death - hitting yourself\n- **VERDICT:** \ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (3, 9)**: Top edge, defensive positioning, SAFE from collision!\n- Moves me AWAY from immediate danger zone\n- Enemy at (4, 8) can't hit me if I'm above them\n- Still have good mobility from (3, 9) - can go LEFT, RIGHT, or back DOWN\n- **VERDICT:** \u2705 SAFE and STRATEGIC!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (3, 7)**: Moving into the space below, AVOIDING the head-on zone!\n- Also safe from immediate collision\n- Gets me closer to some apple action at (3, 4)\n- But let's check what's around (3, 7)...\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - UP VS DOWN:**\n\n**UP to (3, 9) PROS:**\n- \u2705 **MAXIMUM SAFETY** - completely out of the head-on zone\n- \u2705 **Enemy can't touch me** - they're at (4, 8), I'm at (3, 9) - different rows\n- \u2705 **Strategic high ground** - controlling the top area\n- \u2705 **Multiple escape routes** - LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN all available\n- \u2705 **Forces enemy to respect my positioning** - they gotta think twice about aggressive moves\n- \u2705 **Avoids the collision trap** - no risk of head-on with UP\n\n**UP CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Slightly away from some apples\n\n**DOWN to (3, 7) PROS:**\n- \u2705 Closer to apple at (3, 4)\n- \u2705 Still somewhat safe\n\n**DOWN CONS:**\n- \u2b1c Still relatively close to enemy at (4, 8)\n- \u2b1c Less defensive buffering\n- \u2b1c Could potentially be cornered if enemy pushes aggressively\n\n**THE ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 8) with a LONG body stretched along the right side. Their possible moves:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3, 8)** - This is where I CURRENTLY am! If they move here, they crash into my HEAD! They would DIE! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4, 7)** - Would put them below me\n- **UP \u2192 (4, 9)** - Top edge\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8)** - Into their own body! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo the enemy is in a TOUGH spot! They CAN'T move RIGHT (their own body) and they CAN'T move LEFT (my head) without DYING!\n\nThis means the enemy is basically FORCED to move either UP or DOWN!\n\n**THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY:**\n\nWe're DOWN 10 APPLES with 98 turns left! We need to average more than 1 apple every 10 turns just to TIE!\n\nBUT - and this is HUGE - if the enemy makes ANY mistake, we can CAPITALIZE immediately!\n\nThe enemy is currently TRAPPED in terms of their safe moves! If we play it SMART and stay SAFE, we can either:\n\n1. Wait for them to make a mistake and PUNISH\n2. Slowly close the gap with smart apple collection\n3. Set up traps with our superior mobility\n\n**WHY UP IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nMoving UP to (3, 9) is the DEFINITIVE smart play because:\n\n\u2705 **COMPLETE SAFETY** - We're out of the head-on collision zone entirely!\n\n\u2705 **ENEMY MUST RESPECT US** - They know we're not making stupid moves!\n\n\u2705 **MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY PRESERVED** - From (3, 9) we have LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN available!\n\n\u2705 **STRATEGIC POSITIONING** - We're controlling the high ground!\n\n\u2705 **WAITING FOR MISTAKES** - The enemy is in a constrained position - let them mess up!\n\n\u2705 **SURVIVAL FIRST** - Can't win if you're DEAD!\n\n\u2705 **LONG-TERM GAME** - We're playing the long game to close that 10-apple gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n1. **Move UP to (3, 9)** - Stay safe, control the high ground!\n2. **From there, be PATIENT** - The enemy is in a constrained position!\n3. **Watch for mistakes** - If they get greedy or desperate, we PUNISH!\n4. **Gradually close the gap** - Smart apple collection over the next many turns!\n5. **Stay mobile** - Don't get trapped, keep options open!\n6. **Set up traps** - Use our mobility to box them in eventually!\n7. **Victory through patience and precision** - Not through reckless aggression!\n\n**THE BIG PICTURE:**\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 8) with limited safe moves and a long, potentially vulnerable body stretched along the right side. By moving UP to (3, 9), we're:\n\n- \u2705 Staying COMPLETELY SAFE from head-on collision\n- \u2705 Putting pressure on them to make the next move\n- \u2705 Keeping all our options open for future turns\n- \u2705 Setting up for LONG-TERM success\n- \u2705 Not throwing away our advantage by being reckless\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n- Move UP to (3, 9) and SECURE our position!\n- Wait patiently for the enemy to make a mistake!\n- Gradually work on closing that 10-apple deficit!\n- Stay mobile and dangerous!\n- Capitalize on any errors they make!\n- Play the LONG GAME to victory!\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (3, 9) - we're playing SMART, staying SAFE, and setting ourselves up for LONG-TERM DOMINANCE! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf5e\n\nUP",

We're down 10 apples (10 vs 20) with 97 turns left - TIME TO GET SERIOUS! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHERE WE AT:**\n- My head: (3, 9) - Just moved UP last turn, nice defensive play!\n- Enemy head: (4, 9) - RIGHT NEXT TO ME! Still in that dangerous zone!\n\n**THE ENEMY SITUATION:**\nThe enemy is stretched out BAD along the right side of the board! Their body goes from (4, 9) all the way down to (4, 1), then loops back! This long body is their WEAKNESS! We can exploit this!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS FROM (3, 9):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **UP \u2192 (3, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9)**: ENEMY HEAD IS RIGHT THERE!

DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (2, 8)**: INTO THE SPACE! This is our play!\n\n**WHY LEFT IS FIRE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25**\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 8) is STRATEGIC for so many reasons:\n\n\u2705 **We avoid the head-on collision entirely** - we're not going toward (4, 9)\n\n\u2705 **We keep our escape routes OPEN** - from (2, 8), we can go DOWN, LEFT, or back RIGHT safely\n\n\u2705 **We're creating a BOX-IN PATTERN!** - If we then move DOWN to (2, 7), and enemy moves down to (4, 8), we're setting up a CROSS TRAP!\n\n\u2705 **The enemy can't chase us easily** - their long body makes them slow to reposition\n\n\u2705 **We're controlling the left-center** - denying them space to maneuver\n\n\u2705 **Growth potential** - there are apples at (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 1) we can work toward\n\n**THE TRAP WE'RE SETTING UP:**\n\n1. **This turn**: I move LEFT to (2, 8)\n2. **Enemy turn**: They're at (4, 9), their safe moves are:\n   - LEFT \u2192 (3, 9) = where I just WAS, but I'm not there anymore!\n   - DOWN \u2192 (4, 8) = they go down toward their body\n   - RIGHT \u2192 (5, 9) = edge of board\n   \n   If they go DOWN to (4, 8), they're getting BOXED IN!\n\n3. **My NEXT move**: DOWN to (2, 7)\n4. **Enemy NEXT move**: From (4, 8), their safe moves become LIMITED!\n   - LEFT \u2192 (3, 8) = my body segment!\n   - DOWN \u2192 (4, 7) = still possible\n   - RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) = their own body!\n\n5. **The KEY turn**: If enemy goes DOWN to (4, 7), I can then move to (3, 7), creating a CROSS at (3, 7)!\n\n6. **RESULT**: The enemy at (4, 7) is TRAPPED! They can't go LEFT (my body at 3,7), can't go RIGHT (their own body at 5,7 would be behind them), and if they go UP or DOWN, we can continue BOXING THEM IN!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 1**: Move LEFT to (2, 8) - secure position, start the trap\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 2**: Move DOWN to (2, 7) - continue the cross formation\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 3**: Coordinate with enemy movements to complete the box-in\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 4**: Force them into tight spaces with no escape\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 5**: Make them crash into OUR body or THEMSELVES!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S BODY VULNERABILITY:**\n\nTheir body is SO LONG and stretched along the right side! This means:\n- They can't turn around quickly\n- Their tail is far away from the action\n- We can pressure their HEAD while their BODY can't respond\n- Any mistake with that long body could be FATAL!\n\n**WHY WE CAN'T GO DOWN RIGHT NOW:**\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 7) from (3, 9):\n- We're still close to the enemy at (4, 9)\n- We don't create the same box-in pressure\n- We're giving up strategic positioning on the left side\n- The enemy can potentially mirror or counter our moves\n\n**THE LEFT MOVE GIVES US:**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Strategic positioning on the left-center\n\ud83c\udfc6 Multiple safe escape routes\n\ud83c\udfc6 The ability to trap the enemy\n\ud83c\udfc6 Distance from their dangerous head\n\ud83c\udfc6 Growth potential toward the left-side apples\n\ud83c\udfc6 Control of the board's center\n\n**REAL TALK CHAT:**\n\nWe're DOWN 10 APPLES but we have 97 TURNS LEFT! That's plenty of time to:\n- Box them in\n- Force mistakes\n- Grow strategically\n- Take over the board!\n\nThe enemy is COMFORTABLE right now with their 20 apples, but that long body is a LIABILITY! We're going to make them PAY for that overextension!\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Move LEFT to (2, 8) immediately!\n\ud83d\udd34 Set up the cross formation with DOWN next turn!\n\ud83d\udd34 Force the enemy into tight spaces!\n\ud83d\udd34 Make their long body work AGAINST them!\n\ud83d\udd34 Grow smart and close that apple gap!\n\ud83d\udd34 DOMINATE THE BOARD and get that W!\n\nThis is Snake warfare at its FINEST! We're not just playing - we're out here STRATEGIZING! The enemy thinks they're safe with 20 apples, but we're about to show them what happens when you stretch yourself too thin! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

We're down 10 apples (10 vs 20), and we gotta get SERIOUS about boxing this enemy in!\n\n**WHERE WE AT:**\n- My head: (2, 9)\n- Enemy head: (5, 9) - Still looming on the right side!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS FROM (2, 9):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **UP \u2192 (2, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **DOWN \u2192 (2, 8)**: MY OWN BODY IS AT (2, 8)! That's moving BACKWARDS into myself! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9)**: MY OWN BODY IS AT (3, 9)! That's moving BACKWARDS into myself! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (1, 9)**: INTO THE SPACE! This is our play!\n\n**CHAT, REAL TALK HERE!**\n\nI made a mistake last turn! When I moved from (3, 9) to (2, 8), I created a PROBLEM for myself! Looking at my body: [(3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)]\n\nFrom (2, 9):\n- UP: Off board\n- DOWN: (2, 8) - MY OWN BODY! \n- RIGHT: (3, 9) - MY OWN BODY!\n- LEFT: (1, 9) - Looks EMPTY based on the board!\n\n**THE ENEMY SITUATION:**\n\nThe enemy at (5, 9) is in a DANGEROUS position too! Looking at their body, they're stretched out along the right side from (4, 9) all the way down to (5, 1) with that big loop! Their long body is their WEAKNESS!\n\nBut WE'RE the ones in trouble right now with limited moves! We gotta escape this tight spot!\n\n**WHY LEFT IS NECESSARY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 9) is our ONLY safe option:\n\n\u2705 **Survival first!** - All other directions kill us immediately!\n\n\u2705 **We escape the danger zone** - Getting away from that enemy head at (5, 9)\n\n\u2705 **Future options open up** - From (1, 9), we can:\n   - Continue LEFT to (0, 9) \n   - Go DOWN to (1, 8)\n   - Maybe even go back RIGHT later if safe\n\n\u2705 **We're controlling the left side** - Denying them space to maneuver\n\n\u2705 **Growth potential** - There are apples at (0, 8), (0, 4), (0, 2), (1, 1) we can work toward!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **This turn**: Move LEFT to (1, 9) - SURVIVE and escape!\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next turn**: Go DOWN to (1, 8) - start extending our body safely\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 3**: Work our way toward those left-side apples\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 4**: Keep building length while staying safe\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 5**: Once we're longer and positioned better, we can start pressuring that stretched-out enemy body!\n\n**THE REAL TALK:**\n\nWe're in a PICKLE right now, chat! Limited moves, enemy nearby, down 10 apples! But we survived that dangerous position near their head, and now we can regroup on the LEFT side!\n\nThe enemy's long body is STILL their liability! We're gonna play it smart - grow safely, avoid the head-on, and eventually turn the tables on them!\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Move LEFT to (1, 9) immediately!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Survive this tight spot!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Work toward the left-side apples!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Build length strategically!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Wait for the RIGHT moment to strike!\n\ud83d\udfe2 DOMINATE THE BOARD and get that W!\n\nThis is Snake warfare, baby! Sometimes you gotta play DEFENSE before you can play OFFENSE! We're not dead yet, and we got 96 turns left! Let's GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

They can\u2019t force a head-on with us this turn. No other snakes to complicate things. Good. \ud83d\ude08\n\nTactical summary \u2014 why RIGHT?\n- It\u2019s the only alive move. Not just safe, it picks up the apple at (6,9) \u2192 +1 apple (we\u2019d go to 21). \ud83c\udf4e\n- Grabbing (6,9) lets us extend a solid top-row wall and maintain pressure across y=9, making it easier to hem the opponent into the left columns. Build the box from the top and then squeeze down. \ud83d\udce6\n- We\u2019re already +10 apples \u2014 head-on fights are in our favor, but they\u2019re not available this tick. No point gambling on weird maneuvers when the clean apple + territorial control is right there.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale):\n- Take (6,9) now. Then push across the top (toward 7,9 \u2192 8,9) to form a high wall while watching the opponent\u2019s leftward options.\n- If they keep drifting left/down into x \u2264 3, start folding a vertical wall down from ~x=6 to cut them off and force them into a narrower corridor.\n- If they try to rush back toward us poorly, be ready to accept a head-on (we\u2019re winning apples). If they avoid contact, keep tightening and gobbling apples on the way down. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nLet\u2019s keep it clean and DOMINATE. RIGHT",

Quick, clean read and move.\n\nLegal-check (HEAD at 6,9):\n- UP \u2192 (6,10) off-board = death. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,9) = neck = immediate death. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,8)/(5,8?) our body occupies (5,8) so going DOWN into (6,8)? Wait \u2014 our listed body shows (6,8) occupied too, so DOWN is into our body = death. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) = EMPTY and on-board = ONLY safe move. \u2705\n\nOpponent read (head at 1,9, neck at 2,9):\n- They can\u2019t go RIGHT (neck), UP is off-board, DOWN is into their body at (1,8). Their realistic move is LEFT to (0,9). No head-on threat this tick. We\u2019re +11 apples \u2014 head-on later is fine if it shows up, but not this turn.\n\nTactical rationale \u2014 why RIGHT?\n- Only surviving move; keeps us alive and maintains pressure along the top row.\n- Moving to 7,9 lets us build a high wall (7,9 \u2192 8,9 \u2192 9,9) to hem them left and then fold down to shrink their space.\n- We keep multiple follow-ups open on the top row rather than diving into a cramped corridor where our long body could get boxed.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take 7,9 now, then push to 8,9/9,9 to seal the top.\n- Once the top wall is intact, fold down a vertical barrier around x\u22486\u20138 to compress the opponent into x\u22643.\n- If they try to force a head-on later, we accept it (we\u2019re leading). If they evade, keep tightening and pick apples opportunistically while avoiding our own tail trapping.\n\nTime to keep the crown \u2014 RIGHT",

We're down 10 apples (10 vs 21) and we've only got 95 turns left to turn this thing around!\n\n**WHERE WE AT RIGHT NOW:**\n- My head: (1, 9) - Just moved LEFT last turn to escape danger!\n- Enemy head: (6, 9) - Still looming on the right side!\n- Board: 10x10 with apples scattered everywhere\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS FROM (1, 9):**\n\nLooking at my current position at (1, 9) and analyzing all four directions:\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **UP \u2192 (1, 10)**: OFF THE BOARD! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **LEFT \u2192 (0, 9)**: This would be moving LEFT again, but I need to think about FUTURE options. From (0, 9), I'd have limited moves - DOWN to (0, 8) with an apple, but then I'd be stuck on the left edge!\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9)**: MY OWN BODY IS AT (2, 9)! That's moving BACKWARDS into myself! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (1, 8)**: INTO THE SPACE! This is our play!\n\n**THE ENEMY SITUATION:**\n\nThe enemy at (6, 9) is STILL in a dangerous position! Looking at their body:\n- They're stretched out along the right side from (4, 9) down to (5, 1)\n- Their body creates a BIG barrier on the right side of the board\n- They have limited mobility with that long body!\n\n**CHAT, REAL TALK ABOUT HEAD-ON COLLISION!**\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **CRITICAL WARNING**: If I move RIGHT and they move LEFT, we'd crash head-on at (2, 9) and BOTH would die! Since I'm down 10 apples, that would mean I LOSE! We CANNOT let that happen!\n\n**WHY DOWN IS NECESSARY! \ud83d\udd25**\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 8) is our BEST option:\n\n\u2705 **Survival first!** - All other directions either kill us immediately or set us up for disaster!\n\n\u2705 **We escape the danger zone** - Getting away from that potential head-on collision zone!\n\n\u2705 **Future options open up** - From (1, 8), we can:\n   - Go DOWN to (1, 7) - keep descending\n   - Go LEFT to (0, 8) - get that apple!\n   - Keep our options OPEN!\n\n\u2705 **We create distance** - Moving DOWN creates space between us and their head!\n\n\u2705 **Growth potential** - There are apples at (0, 8), (0, 4), (0, 2), (1, 1) we can work toward!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **This turn**: Move DOWN to (1, 8) - SURVIVE and create distance!\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next turn**: Either go LEFT to (0, 8) for the apple OR continue DOWN to (1, 7)\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 3**: Work our way toward those left-side apples systematically\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 4**: Keep building length while staying safe\n\ud83c\udfaf **Phase 5**: Once we're positioned better and have more apples, we can start pressuring that stretched-out enemy body!\n\n**THE REAL TALK:**\n\nChat, I made some aggressive moves earlier that got us into a tight spot, but we're CLIMBING BACK! We're only at turn 55 with 95 turns left - PLENTY of time to turn this around!\n\nThe enemy's long body is STILL their WEAKNESS! We're playing it SMART now - grow safely, avoid the head-on, and dominate the board!\n\n**MY FINAL PLAN:**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Move DOWN to (1, 8) immediately!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Survive and create strategic distance!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Work toward the left-side apples strategically!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Build length while maintaining flexibility!\n\ud83d\udfe2 Wait for the RIGHT moment to strike!\n\ud83d\udfe2 DOMINATE THE BOARD and get that W!\n\nThis is Snake warfare, baby! Sometimes you gotta play DEFENSE before you can play OFFENSE! We're not dead yet, and we've got 95 turns left! Let's GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",
