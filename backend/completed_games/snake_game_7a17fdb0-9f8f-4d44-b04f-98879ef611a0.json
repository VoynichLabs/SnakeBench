Snake 1 is at (8, 6).\nThe board is 10x10.\nApples are at: (6, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2).\n\nMy head is at (2, 6).\nSafe moves check:\n1. UP to (2, 7): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (2, 5): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (1, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe as I have no body segments and am not near the board edges or the enemy snake head (8, 6).\n\nNow, I evaluate which move is best to collect apples.\n\nApples sorted by Manhattan distance from (2, 6):\n1. (1, 2): Distance = $|2-1| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n2. (0, 2): Distance = $|2-0| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n3. (6, 3): Distance = $|2-6| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7$.\n4. (6, 4): Distance = $|2-6| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6$. (Same distance as (0, 2)).\n5. (9, 4): Distance = $|2-9| + |6-4| = 7 + 2 = 9$.\n\nI should prioritize moving towards (1, 2) or (6, 4)/(6, 3).\n\nLet's check directions and how they affect the distance to closest apples:\n\nApple (1, 2):\n- UP (2, 7): Dist to (1, 2) increases to 6.\n- DOWN (2, 5): Dist to (1, 2) decreases to 4.\n- LEFT (1, 6): Dist to (1, 2) decreases to 4.\n- RIGHT (3, 6): Dist to (1, 2) increases to 6.\n\nApple (6, 4):\n- UP (2, 7): Dist to (6, 4) increases to 7.\n- DOWN (2, 5): Dist to (6, 4) increases to 5.\n- LEFT (1, 6): Dist to (6, 4) increases to 6.\n- RIGHT (3, 6): Dist to (6, 4) decreases to 5.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT look good for approaching the closest apple (1, 2).\nDOWN moves me to (2, 5), which is 4 units away from (1, 2).\nLEFT moves me to (1, 6), which is 4 units away from (1, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 6): I am 4 steps from (1, 2). I am also closer to (0, 2) (4 steps).\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 5): I am 4 steps from (1, 2). I am also slightly closer to (6, 4) (5 steps vs 6 steps from (1, 6)).\n\nGiven the concentration of apples on the left side (1, 2) and (0, 2), moving Left or Down seems optimal.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake at (8, 6). It's much closer to (9, 4) (Distance 1+2=3) and potentially the (6, 3) and (6, 4) apples (Distance 2+3=5 and 2+2=4 respectively). It is highly likely Snake 1 will move right towards (9, 4) or left/down towards (6, 4)/(6, 3).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 6), I maximize my distance from the enemy and focus entirely on the left side apples (1, 2) and (0, 2). This prevents conflict.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 5), I maintain a central position, allowing flexibility, but slightly increase the chance of running into Snake 1 later if it heads down the center of the board towards y=4 or y=3.\n\nSince (1, 2) is the closest apple, and moving LEFT gets me directly onto the column where that apple resides, LEFT seems the most targeted move.\n\nDirection | New Pos | Dist to (1, 2) | Dist to (0, 2)\n---|---|---|---\nUP | (2, 7) | 6 | 7\nDOWN | (2, 5) | 4 | 5\nLEFT | (1, 6) | 4 | 4\nRIGHT| (3, 6) | 6 | 7\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are good for (1, 2). LEFT is better for (0, 2). Since I want to focus on the left side, LEFT is the appropriate first move.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards (1, 2) via the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

No collision risks from the enemy snake at this distance.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity Analysis**\nApples are at: (6, 3), (6, 4), (1, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2).\nMy current position is (1, 4). My target is the closest apple (1, 2).\n\nApples sorted by Manhattan distance from (1, 4):\n1. (1, 2): Distance = $|1-1| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2$. (Directly below)\n2. (0, 2): Distance = $|1-0| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (Left and down)\n3. (6, 4): Distance = $|1-6| + |4-4| = 5 + 0 = 5$.\n4. (6, 3): Distance = $|1-6| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n5. (9, 4): Distance = $|1-9| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8$.\n\nI am focused on the closest apple (1, 2).\n\n3. **Evaluating Moves based on (1, 2)**\n\n| Move | New Position | Dist to (1, 2) | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (1, 5) | 3 (Increase) | Moves away from target (1, 2). |\n| DOWN | (1, 3) | 1 (Decrease) | Direct progress towards (1, 2). |\n| LEFT | (0, 4) | 3 (Increase) | Moves toward (0, 2) x-coord, but away from (1, 2). |\n| RIGHT | (2, 4) | 4 (Increase) | Moves away from target area. |\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 3) is the optimal move to stay on the shortest path to apple (1, 2).\n\n4. **Enemy Threat Assessment**\nSnake 1 is at (9, 6). Snake 1 is likely targeting (9, 4) (D=2, if it moves (9, 5) then (9, 4)) or (6, 4).\nPossible moves for Snake 1: (9, 7) UP, (9, 5) DOWN, (8, 6) LEFT.\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (9, 5), it will be at distance 1 to (9, 4) next turn.\nIts movement does not influence my path to (1, 2).\n\n5. **Decision and Long-Term Plan**\nI will move DOWN to (1, 3). On the next turn (T=4), moving DOWN again to (1, 2) will result in eating the apple. After eating (1, 2), the next closest apple is (0, 2).\n\nLong-term plan:\nT3: DOWN to (1, 3).\nT4: DOWN to (1, 2) (EAT Apple). Snake length becomes 2. Head at (1, 2), Tail at (1, 3).\nT5: LEFT to (0, 2) (EAT Apple). Snake length becomes 3.\n\nDOWN",
