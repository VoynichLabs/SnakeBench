The closest by Manhattan distance is the apple at (0,4). From (2,5), the distance to (0,4) is |2\u20130| + |5\u20134| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps.\n\n\u2022 A straightforward path to (0,4) is:\n\u2003\u20031. Move LEFT from (2,5) to (1,5).\n\u2003\u20032. Then move DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4).\n\u2003\u20033. Finally, move LEFT from (1,4) to (0,4) to collect the apple.\n\n\u2022 Checking nearby obstacles:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Moving LEFT to (1,5) is safe (no body part or wall there).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoiding any backward movement (our neck is at (2,6)) is maintained, since we\u2019re not turning right/up.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The enemy snake is not near enough to pose a risk on this route.\n\n\u2022 Thus, steering LEFT now will begin our path toward the apple at (0,4). In our next turn we can plan to go DOWN then LEFT to finish the route.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn: After moving LEFT and then making progress toward (0,4), always scout for alternative safe paths in case enemy snakes move or if our own body starts to block the way.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

In our next turn we can plan to go DOWN then LEFT to finish the route.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn: After moving LEFT and then making progress toward (0,4), always scout for alternative safe paths in case enemy snakes move or if our own body starts to block the way.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

The enemy snake is down low, and several apples (like those at (2,5) and (2,4)) are in congested regions near our own trailing body.\n\nIn contrast, moving DOWN to (5,8) would not improve our access to open space; it brings us closer to the more congested central area.

The enemy snake is down low, and several apples (like those at (2,5) and (2,4)) are in congested regions near our own trailing body.\n\nIn contrast, moving DOWN to (5,8) would not improve our access to open space; it brings us closer to the more congested central area.
