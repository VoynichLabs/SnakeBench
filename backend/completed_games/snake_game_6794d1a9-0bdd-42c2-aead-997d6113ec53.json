These three apples are relatively close together, allowing me to potentially collect multiple apples efficiently.

I have two immediate opportunities:\n- DOWN to (5, 4) collects an apple directly\n- RIGHT to (6, 5) collects an apple directly\n\nBoth moves collect an apple! Let me evaluate which is better:\n\n**DOWN (5, 4):**\n- Collects apple at (5, 4)\n- From (5, 4), I can move RIGHT to (6, 5) [apple], then RIGHT to (7, 5) [between (7,7) and (8,5)], then UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5) [apple]\n- Creates a good linear path through the right-side apple cluster\n\n**RIGHT (6, 5):**\n- Collects apple at (6, 5)\n- From (6, 5), I can move UP to (6, 6) or RIGHT to (7, 5), heading toward (7, 7) or (8, 5)\n- Also positions well for the cluster\n\nDOWN is slightly better because:\n1. It keeps me closer to the center, maintaining maximum flexibility\n2. After collecting at (5, 4), I can sweep RIGHT along row 5 collecting (6, 5) and (8, 5)\n3. This creates a natural progression without backtracking\n\nThe enemy at (1, 1) is far away and no threat.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 5 turns:**\n- Turn 4 (now): DOWN to (5, 4) - collect apple #1\n- Turn 5: RIGHT to (6, 5) - collect apple #2\n- Turn 6: RIGHT to (7, 5) - continue toward (8, 5)\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (8, 5) - collect apple #3\n- Turn 8: UP toward (7, 7) - collect apple #4\nAfter this, reassess positions and continue collecting efficiently.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps me moving toward the apple cluster\n2. It positions me for an immediate apple collection next turn at (6, 5)\n3. My body at (5, 5) won't block future movement options\n4. The enemy is nowhere near this area\n\n**Long-term plan for next 5 turns:**\n- Turn 5 (now): RIGHT to (6, 4) - position for apple run\n- Turn 6: UP to (6, 5) - collect apple #2\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 5) - continue toward (8, 5)\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (8, 5) - collect apple #3\n- Turn 9: UP toward (7, 7) - collect apple #4\nAfter collecting the right-side cluster, assess if left-side apples are worth pursuing.\n\nRIGHT",
