They are poised to move UP to (9, 6) to eat an apple.\n3.  **Apple Analysis**: The enemy effectively controls the column 9 apples {(9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 9)}. It is inefficient and dangerous to chase directly behind them in column 9. There are other apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6) towards the left.\n4.  **Move Evaluation**:\n    *   **DOWN**: Hits my own body (neck) at (8, 1). **Death**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 2). This puts me in the same column as the enemy, trailing their growth. This limits my mobility and puts me in a dead-end if the enemy stops or turns.\n    *   **LEFT**: Moves to (7, 2). This is safe and starts moving towards the left apples, but moving UP is equally efficient for reaching those apples while staying closer to the right side in case the enemy makes a mistake.\n    *   **UP**: Moves to (8, 3). This effectively mirrors the enemy's vertical movement in a safe adjacent lane (column 8). Since the enemy's tail is at (8, 5) and will likely remain there for one turn (if they eat), moving UP now times my arrival at (8, 5) perfectly for when it becomes vacated. This path keeps options open for both the top-right apples (if available later) and the left-side apples.\n\n**Strategy**: I will move UP along column 8. This path drafts behind the enemy's tail movement, allowing me to safely ascend the board. If the enemy consumes the right-side apples, I will be at the correct vertical level (y=6) to turn LEFT towards the apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6).\n\nUP",

Regardless of whether they eat or just move, the cell (8, 5) (their current head) will become occupied by their body or tail on the next turn.\n*   **Why not UP?** Moving UP to (8, 4) places me next to the enemy head (risk of head-on if they move DOWN aggressively). More importantly, the path forward at (8, 5) will be blocked next turn, forcing me to turn anyway. It offers no positional advantage.\n*   **Why LEFT?** Moving LEFT to (7, 3) completely avoids any collision risk. It moves me towards the apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6). Distance calculations show that if the enemy spends time eating the apple at (9, 6), I will be closer to the apple at (4, 6) by the time they are finished. This move effectively splits the board, letting the enemy have the crowded right side while I take the open left side.\n\n**Plan**\nI will move LEFT to (7, 3) to target the apple at (4, 6).

It is highly probable they will move UP to take it, growing to length 3.\n*   **Strategy**: The board contains a cluster of apples on the right (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 9) which the enemy is positioned to take. On the left/center, there are apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6). My best strategy is to cede the right side to the enemy and claim the left side safely.\n*   **Move Evaluation**:\n    *   **UP (7, 4)**: Valid. Moves closer to the y-level of the apples. However, it brings me closer to the enemy's potential body/path (columns 8/9). Distance to target (4, 6) is 5.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 3)**: Valid. Moves closer to the x-level of the apples.

It creates a buffer zone between me and the enemy snake. I will proceed to collect the apples at (4, 6) and (2, 6).\n\n**Plan for Next Turn**\nEnemy likely took apple at (9, 6).

The enemy is at (9, 6) with body segments at (9, 5) and (8, 5), facing Up (likely, or having just arrived at 9, 6).\n*   **Enemy Prediction**: The enemy head is at (9, 6). There are two apples vertically adjacent at (9, 8) and (9, 9). It is overwhelmingly likely the enemy will move UP to collect these, keeping it on the x=9 column for the next few turns.\n*   **Target Strategy**: My target is the cluster of apples on the left: (4, 6), (2, 6), and (2, 5). The closest is (4, 6).\n*   **Move Evaluation**:\n    *   **UP (6, 4)**: This move reduces the Y-distance to the target apples (which are at Y=5 and Y=6). It puts me at (6, 4), balancing the X and Y distance to the target (4, 6), which creates a flexible \"square\" of path options. It maintains a 3-column buffer from the enemy (x=9).\n    *   **LEFT (5, 3)**: This move reduces the X-distance to the target, but leaves a large Y-distance (Y=3 vs Y=6). It creates an \"elongated\" path (1x3) which has fewer permutations and is less flexible. It offers slightly more safety buffer (4 columns), but the current buffer is already sufficient.\n    *   **DOWN**: Moves away from targets.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Immediate collision with tail.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMoving UP is the most efficient move to position for the apples at Y=6. It balances my approach path, allowing for flexible maneuvering. The risk from the enemy is minimal as they are incentivized to move UP along the right wall.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn**\nMove UP to (6, 4). Then, navigate towards (4, 6) (likely via (5, 4) or (6, 5)), keeping an eye on the enemy's movement. After grabbing (4, 6), proceed to (2, 6) and (2, 5).\n\nUP",
