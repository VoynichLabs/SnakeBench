No body segments yet, so no self-collision except moving into own head (impossible here).  \n2. Off-board? All moves stay within 0\u20139 in x and y.  \n3. Enemy body? Snake #1 has no body yet, so only possible collision is with enemy head.  \n   - Enemy head at (4,6). Could enemy move into my target cell this turn? They could move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (4,6).  \n   - Let\u2019s check each of my moves for possible head-on collision:  \n     * UP to (2,6): enemy could move to (2,6)? From (4,6), moving LEFT twice in one turn? No, they move only one step. Their possible moves: (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6). (2,6) not reachable for them this turn. Safe from head-on.  \n     * DOWN to (2,4): enemy moves: (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6). No (2,4). Safe.  \n     * LEFT to (1,5): enemy moves: (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6). No (1,5). Safe.  \n     * RIGHT to (3,5): enemy moves: (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6). (3,6) is possible for them if they choose LEFT. But (3,5) is not (3,6). So no direct head-on.  \n\nSo all four moves are safe from immediate death.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- Closest apple in Manhattan distance: (4,2) is 3 steps away (|2-4|+|5-2| = 2+3=5? Wait recalc: |2-4|=2, |5-2|=3, total 5). Actually (7,0) is 2+5=7, (1,9) is 1+4=5, (9,8) is 7+3=10, (8,8) is 6+3=9, (4,2) is 2+3=5. So (1,9) and (4,2) both distance 5.  \n\nFrom (2,5):  \n- UP to (2,6): distances to (4,2)=6, to (1,9)=4.  \n- DOWN to (2,4): to (4,2)=4, to (1,9)=6.  \n- LEFT to (1,5): to (4,2)=6, to (1,9)=4.  \n- RIGHT to (3,5): to (4,2)=4, to (1,9)=6.  \n\nSo UP and LEFT get closer to (1,9), DOWN and RIGHT get closer to (4,2).  \n\n**Future options:**  \nAt turn 0, no body, so anywhere is fine. But I should avoid moving toward enemy if it risks future head-on. Enemy at (4,6) is far for now.  \n\n(4,2) is closer in y difference from me than (1,9) is, so maybe go DOWN toward (4,2) first.  \n\nDOWN to (2,4): next turn, possible moves from there will still be open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (4,2) while keeping an eye on enemy movement. If enemy moves toward same apple, maybe shift to (1,9) instead.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and risk:**  \n\nRIGHT to (9,5) eats apple immediately, but then my body grows next turn, and from (9,5) after eating:  \nPossible moves from (9,5) next turn:  \nUP (9,6) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nDOWN (9,4) \u2013 will be my body after growth? Wait, after eating apple at (9,5), my body becomes: head at (9,5), then old head (8,5) becomes new segment 2, then (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). So (9,4) is empty. Actually, let\u2019s check: current body: (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). After moving RIGHT to (9,5) and eating apple, new body: (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2). So (9,4) is empty.  \nDOWN (9,4) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nLEFT (8,5) \u2013 my body \u274c (segment 2)  \nRIGHT off board \u274c  \nSo from (9,5) after eating, only UP and DOWN are safe (2 moves). That\u2019s risky.  \n\nUP to (8,6):  \nFrom (8,6) next turn, possible moves:  \nUP (8,7) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nDOWN (8,5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nLEFT (7,6) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT (9,6) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\nLEFT to (7,5):  \nFrom (7,5) next turn:  \nUP (7,6) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nDOWN (7,4) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nLEFT (6,5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT (8,5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility and apple access:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (8,6), I\u2019m farther from apple (9,5) but keep high mobility.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7,5), I\u2019m closer to apples (3,3) and (2,2) but farther from (9,5).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I get apple now but reduce mobility next turn to 2 safe moves, which could be dangerous if enemy approaches later.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away, maybe I can take apple now and survive with 2 moves next turn, but that\u2019s risky if one of those moves leads to a trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nSafest is UP or LEFT for mobility.  \nApple (9,5) is tempting but puts me in a corner with fewer options after eating.  \nLet\u2019s choose UP to (8,6) to keep mobility high and stay near top-right area, possibly approach apple (9,5) from a safer angle later (e.g., from (8,6) go RIGHT to (9,6) then DOWN to (9,5) if safe).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,6), consider moving toward (9,5) if enemy not threatening, or toward center apples (3,3)/(2,2) if path clear. Keep mobility high.  \n\nUP",

Let\u2019s check carefully:  \nCurrent body: head (9,6), then (8,6), (8,5), (8,4).  \nIf I move UP to (9,7): new head (9,7), new body: (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), tail (8,4) stays.  \nSo next turn from (9,7):  \nUP (9,8) empty \u2705  \nDOWN (9,6) my body \u274c  \nLEFT (8,7) empty \u2705  \nRIGHT off board \u274c  \n\nSo next turn from (9,7) I\u2019d have UP and LEFT safe. That\u2019s better than only 1 safe move after eating apple, but still limited.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare:**  \nDOWN \u2192 eat apple, but next turn only 1 safe move (DOWN to (9,4)), then possibly trapped.  \nUP \u2192 no apple, but next turn 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT), keeps options open.\n\nGiven the enemy is far away, maybe I can eat apple and survive if I plan escape route. But from (9,4) after eating:  \nBody would be: (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4).  \nFrom (9,4):  \nUP (9,5) body \u274c  \nDOWN (9,3) empty \u2705  \nLEFT (8,4) body \u274c  \nRIGHT off board \u274c  \n\nSo from (9,4) only DOWN is safe again! That\u2019s a trap \u2014 I\u2019d be forced down the right edge with no left turn until tail moves.\n\nToo risky. Better to avoid eating apple now if it forces me into a corridor with 1 exit repeatedly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP is safer long-term. It avoids the trap of the right-edge corridor. I can later go LEFT toward center apples. Enemy is far away, so I have time to reposition.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,7), go UP or LEFT to increase space, then work toward (3,3) or (2,2) apples. Keep enemy in view \u2014 it\u2019s at top-left, might come down for center apples soon. Avoid getting trapped on edges.\n\n---\n\nUP",

If I go LEFT to (4, 7), next turn we could be closer but not adjacent.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nLeft-side apples at (3, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1) are closer if I move DOWN or LEFT.  \nRIGHT is blocked by my own body.  \nUP moves away from those apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nFrom (5, 8) \u2013 UP: all 4 moves open next turn.  \nFrom (5, 6) \u2013 DOWN: all 4 moves open.  \nFrom (4, 7) \u2013 LEFT: all 4 moves open.  \n\nAll three safe moves keep full mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision this turn?**  \nEnemy at (2, 7) cannot reach my possible destinations (5, 8), (5, 6), (4, 7) in one move. So no immediate head-on risk.  \n\nNext turn risk: If enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 7) and I go LEFT to (4, 7), we\u2019d be at (3, 7) vs (4, 7) \u2192 adjacent horizontally. Then possible head-on next turn if we both move toward each other. That\u2019s a future risk but not this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (7 vs 4). I need apples to catch up.  \nLEFT to (4, 7) progresses toward left-side apples.  \nDOWN to (5, 6) also progresses toward left/down apples but slightly less direct.  \nUP delays apple pursuit.  \n\nBest: LEFT or DOWN.  \n\nBetween LEFT and DOWN:  \nLEFT puts me at (4, 7) \u2013 closer to left wall but still fine.  \nDOWN at (5, 6) \u2013 more central, maybe safer from being cornered later.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (2, 7), moving DOWN gives more distance from enemy head horizontally while still moving toward apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 6), consider moving LEFT/DOWN toward (3, 3) or (2, 2). Keep checking enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped near walls.  \n\nDOWN",

But enemy is longer, so avoid head-on later.  \n\nBetter to approach apples but keep distance from enemy head.  \nEnemy at (2, 6), me at (5, 6) \u2192 3 apart horizontally.  \nIf I go DOWN to (5, 5), enemy goes DOWN to (2, 5), we\u2019re 3 apart horizontally, 0 vertically \u2014 still safe distance.  \n\nLEFT to (4, 6) puts me 2 away horizontally from enemy if enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 6) \u2014 adjacent diagonally, not same cell, okay. But next turn could be risky if we both move toward each other.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose safest with apple path:**  \nRIGHT has poor mobility (only 2 moves next turn) \u2192 eliminate.  \nLEFT and DOWN both okay.  \nDOWN gives slightly more space from enemy horizontally if enemy moves RIGHT.  \nLEFT moves toward apples more directly but slightly closer to enemy\u2019s possible RIGHT move.\n\nGiven my shorter length, I should prioritize both safety and apples.  \nDOWN to (5, 5) keeps more options next turn (except UP blocked) but still DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT open.  \nLEFT to (4, 6) has LEFT/DOWN/UP open next turn.  \n\nI think LEFT is slightly better for apple proximity and future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 6), consider moving DOWN or LEFT toward (3, 3) while tracking enemy head. Avoid moving to (3, 6) if enemy might be there. Keep growing to catch up in length.\n\nLEFT",

Wait: enemy head is at (3, 6) now. If I move LEFT into (3, 6), enemy moves simultaneously. But if enemy stays there, I die. If enemy moves away, I could occupy it safely. However, rule: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d Enemy head is not body, but if we swap? Actually, simultaneous movement: if enemy moves out of (3, 6) to some other cell this turn, then (3, 6) becomes empty or maybe enemy body? Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s body starts at (2, 6) (second segment). So if enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 6), then (3, 6) becomes empty (since body doesn\u2019t include old head after move). But if enemy moves LEFT to (2, 6), that\u2019s into its own body? No, (2, 6) is its own body segment now, so enemy can\u2019t move LEFT. Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n\nEnemy at (3, 6), body: [(2, 6), (2, 7), \u2026]  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP (3, 7) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (3, 5) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (2, 6) \u2013 its own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (4, 6) \u2013 my head\u2019s current position (but I\u2019ll move away) \u2013 actually (4, 6) will be empty after I move unless I stay. If I stay, enemy moving RIGHT into (4, 6) would kill it (my head there). If I leave, it\u2019s empty. So enemy could go RIGHT if I\u2019m not there.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nNow my LEFT to (3, 6):  \nIf enemy moves UP to (3, 7) or DOWN to (3, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 6), then (3, 6) is empty this turn after enemy leaves. So I can move into (3, 6) safely unless enemy stays. But enemy cannot stay because staying would require moving into its own body (LEFT into (2, 6) is invalid, other directions all move away). So enemy must leave (3, 6). Therefore (3, 6) will be empty when I arrive. So LEFT is safe.  \n\nCheck: enemy\u2019s old head position becomes empty after move, so no collision with enemy body.  \n\nSo all four directions might be safe? Let\u2019s check my own body:  \nUP (4, 7) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (4, 5) \u2013 empty  \nLEFT (3, 6) \u2013 enemy head now but will be empty after enemy moves  \nRIGHT (5, 6) \u2013 my own body \u274c (second segment)  \n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe (moving into own body).  \n\nSafe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy possible destinations: (4, 7), (4, 5), (3, 6).  \nEnemy possible destinations: (3, 7), (3, 5), (4, 6).  \n\nOverlap check:  \n- (4, 7) vs enemy dest: no match.  \n- (4, 5) vs enemy dest: no match.  \n- (3, 6) vs enemy dest: no match (enemy not going to (3, 6) because it\u2019s leaving it).  \n\nSo no head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and growth need:**  \nI have 3 apples, enemy has 6. Need to catch up.  \nClosest apples: (3, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1) in lower left.  \nFrom (4, 6):  \n- DOWN to (4, 5) moves toward them.  \n- LEFT to (3, 6) then next turn can go DOWN toward them.  \n- UP to (4, 7) moves away from apples.  \n\nSo UP is less desirable for apple gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n1. UP to (4, 7): new body [(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]  \n   Next turn from (4, 7):  \n   UP (4, 8) empty, DOWN (4, 6) my body \u274c, LEFT (3, 7) empty, RIGHT (5, 7) my body \u274c \u2192 2 moves open.  \n\n2. DOWN to (4, 5): new body [(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]  \n   Next turn from (4, 5):  \n   UP (4, 6) my body \u274c, DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) empty, RIGHT (5, 5) empty \u2192 3 moves open.  \n\n3. LEFT to (3, 6): new body [(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]  \n   Next turn from (3, 6):  \n   UP (3, 7) empty, DOWN (3, 5) empty, LEFT (2, 6) enemy body \u274c, RIGHT (4, 6) my body \u274c \u2192 2 moves open.  \n\nSo DOWN gives best future mobility (3 options), LEFT and UP give 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (4, 5), enemy could be at (3, 5) if it goes DOWN, or (3, 7) if UP, or (4, 6) if RIGHT.  \nIf enemy at (3, 5), we\u2019re adjacent diagonally, not same cell, safe.  \nIf enemy at (4, 6), we\u2019re adjacent vertically (me at (4, 5), enemy at (4, 6)) \u2014 that\u2019s risky next turn if we both move toward each other.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 6), enemy could be at (3, 7) or (3, 5) or (4, 6). If enemy at (4, 6), we\u2019re adjacent horizontally \u2014 also risky.  \n\nActually, DOWN seems slightly safer distance from enemy\u2019s possible positions.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nNeed apples on left side. Move toward (3, 3) area while keeping enemy head at a safe distance. Enemy is longer, so avoid adjacent positions that could lead to head-on next turn.  \n\nDOWN now to (4, 5), then next turn possibly LEFT to (3, 5) or DOWN to (4, 4) toward apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gives best mobility and moves toward apples while minimizing immediate risk.  \n\nDOWN",

It will likely move DOWN to (4, 3) or LEFT to (3, 4).

Need apples to catch up.  \nApple (3, 3) may be eaten by enemy this turn, so maybe target (2, 2) or (3, 1).  \nDOWN to (4, 3) positions me to go LEFT to (3, 3) if apple remains, or DOWN to (4, 2) toward (2, 2).  \nRIGHT gives more space but delays apple gathering.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s length advantage, staying alive and keeping options open is key. RIGHT is safest for mobility, but I need apples.  \nLet\u2019s compromise: go DOWN to (4, 3) \u2014 moves toward apples, keeps 2+ moves next turn, avoids immediate risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4, 3), check if (3, 3) apple remains. If yes and safe, go LEFT. If not, go DOWN toward (2, 2) or RIGHT to open space. Avoid moving adjacent to enemy head.  \n\nDOWN",

Next turn, go RIGHT to (9, 3) to eat apple if still there. If apple gone (eaten by me or somehow vanished), then go UP toward (9, 4) or (9, 5).

Those four apples at (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7) are valuable targets. I'll need to navigate carefully to avoid the enemy snake which is in row 3. Moving through the bottom rows (rows 0-2) looks safer before heading up column 9. I might also consider the apple at (4, 9) as an alternative target to avoid direct confrontation with the enemy snake near the right edge.\n\nRIGHT",

This would grow my snake by 1 segment.\n\n**Critical analysis:**\nMoving DOWN to (4, 5) would be fatal as this is my own body segment. This move must be eliminated.\n\n**Strategy evaluation:**\nThree moves are safe: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 6)** is extremely attractive - it's directly on an apple! This would:\n- Give me my 11th apple, extending my lead to 11-8\n- Grow my snake by 1 segment\n- Position me near the center-right area with access to apples at (6, 9) and potentially (6, 1), (6, 2)\n\n**UP to (4, 7)** is also good - it moves me toward the apple at (4, 9) and keeps me in a relatively safe area away from the enemy snake.\n\n**LEFT to (3, 6)** is safe but doesn't advance my primary objective of collecting apples efficiently - it moves me away from the apple cluster.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake's head is at (7, 6), right next to my position. This is concerning! It's only 2 cells away horizontally. However, the enemy snake appears to be moving in a pattern that takes it toward the right edge of the board. It has several possible moves, but the most aggressive would be LEFT toward me.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 6) and the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 6), we won't collide this turn. The closest we could get is if we both move toward each other, but we'd still be separated by at least one cell after this move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nCollect the apple at (5, 6) now, which gives me a solid lead and positions me well for the apples at (6, 9), (6, 1), and (6, 2). I need to be cautious about the enemy snake at (7, 6) - monitor its movements closely and maintain distance. After collecting (5, 6), I can consider moving UP toward (6, 9) or assess whether to go for the lower apples based on enemy positioning.\n\nRIGHT",

Going DOWN sets me up to get them in 1\u20132 more moves.  \nMy tail is at (9, 6) after this move if I go DOWN, so plenty of space.  \nGoing DOWN also avoids moving toward enemy\u2019s long body on the left side.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nTake DOWN now to (6, 3), then next turn go DOWN to (6, 2) to eat apple (6, 2) or (6, 1) after. Keep checking enemy\u2019s movement; it will likely go for top apples, giving me time to collect lower apples safely. Avoid moving left into column 4 or 5 where enemy body is.\n\nDOWN",

It:\n1. Positions me closer to the apple at (6, 9) - I could potentially reach it in 2 moves\n2. Keeps me in the upper half of the board where most apples are located\n3.

Avoid getting trapped near bottom edge. Keep enemy\u2019s possible moves in mind \u2014 enemy is far for now but can move quickly.  \n\nUP",

Wait, check carefully:  \nEnemy body: (6,8) is behind head, (5,9) above, (4,8) left, (5,7) down. All four adjacent cells are part of its body. That means enemy is trapped and will die this turn unless it can move into an apple cell that is also part of its body (impossible here).  \nSo enemy dies this turn no matter what.  \n\nThus, **no head-on collision risk** because enemy will be dead after this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \nApple at (9, 0) is far.  \nApple at (9, 9) is 7 steps away.  \nApple at (1, 7) far.  \nApple at (1, 5) far.  \nApple at (0, 3) far.  \n\nFrom (8, 2):  \n- UP to (8, 3):  \n  Next turn safe moves: UP (8,4) empty, DOWN (8,2) my body (no), LEFT (7,3) empty, RIGHT (9,3) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n- LEFT to (7, 2):  \n  Next turn safe moves: UP (7,3) empty, DOWN (7,1) my body (no), LEFT (6,2) my body (no), RIGHT (8,2) my body (no) \u2192 only UP safe? Wait, check: (7,1) is my body, (6,2) is my body, (8,2) will be empty after moving? No, (8,2) is current head, after moving LEFT, body becomes [(7,2), (8,1), (7,1), ...], so (8,2) is empty next turn. So from (7,2) next turn:  \n  UP (7,3) empty \u2705  \n  DOWN (7,1) my body \u274c  \n  LEFT (6,2) my body \u274c  \n  RIGHT (8,2) empty \u2705  \n  \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n- RIGHT to (9, 2):  \n  Next turn safe moves: UP (9,3) empty, DOWN (9,1) empty, LEFT (8,2) empty, RIGHT off board \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Strategy:**  \nEnemy dies this turn, so I win immediately if I survive this move.  \nSo just avoid suicide. All three moves are safe.  \n\nUP and RIGHT give best mobility (3 safe moves next turn).  \nLEFT gives only 2 safe moves.  \n\nApple (9, 9) is reachable long-term; moving UP or RIGHT keeps me flexible.  \nRIGHT moves toward right edge, which could limit later options if I go too far right.  \nUP moves toward center, more open space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nWith enemy dead, focus on collecting apples safely.  \nFrom (8, 3), I can go toward (9, 9) via rightward+up moves, or toward (0, 3) via left.  \nAvoid trapping myself; keep space to loop around.  \n\nUP",

This is a critical situation. I'm completely surrounded by my own body segments. However, let me double-check the coordinates:\n\nLooking at my body: [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n\nFrom head at (5, 8):\n- UP: (5, 9) - body segment at index 2\n- DOWN: (5, 7) - body segment at index 6\n- LEFT: (4, 8) - body segment at index 4\n- RIGHT: (6, 8) - body segment at index 0\n\nWait, this can't be right. If all four directions are blocked by my own body, I would have no legal moves and would be trapped. Let me re-examine the board visualization:\n\nLooking at the board, my head (1) is at (5, 8). The cells around me show:\n- Above: T (my tail/body)\n- Below: T (my tail/body)\n- Left: T (my tail/body)\n- Right: T (my tail/body)\n\nThis appears to be a trapped situation where I have no safe moves. However, this seems unusual given I was moving and collecting apples. Let me check if there's a safe spot I'm missing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board:\n```\n 9 . . . . T T T . . A\n 8 . . . . T 1 T . . .\n```\n\nAt position (5, 8), I see:\n- (5, 9) above: T (body)\n- (5, 7) below: T (body)\n- (4, 8) left: T (body)\n- (6, 8) right: T (body)\n\nAll four directions are indeed occupied by my own body. This means I have no safe moves and will die regardless of what I choose. However, I must make a move.\n\nSince all moves lead to death, I'll choose UP to (5, 9) as it's the move that was part of my body's previous position and might be the most natural continuation, though it will result in my death.\n\nUP",
