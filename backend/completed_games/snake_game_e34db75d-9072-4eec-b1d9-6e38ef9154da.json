DOWN to (0,5) is also safe but might steer you toward potential early blockade along the enemy\u2019s y=4 line in the next turn. Since both are safe now and RIGHT keeps more future options, RIGHT is the safer flexible choice.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Maintain mobility and avoid getting boxed in near enemy #0. Gradually approach the central apples (especially (3,3)) while avoiding paths through (2,4)-(5,5). If pressed, retreat to the left edge to reset escape routes, but avoid running into the enemy head-on.

It keeps me in open lower area away from my own torso.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- Prefer moves that keep many follow-ups and move toward reachable apples. UP would approach the apple at (5,5) but into tighter space near my own body; DOWN and RIGHT both reach the (6,1) apple quickly. RIGHT has the advantage of staying in open space and keeps three good follow-ups available next turn (UP, DOWN\u2192apple, RIGHT).\n- Enemy is on the far left and unlikely to contest the (6,1) apple this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (6,2) next turn take (6,1) (or approach it) and continue clearing the bottom apple cluster (0,1),(1,1),(6,1). After each move re-evaluate for traps or enemy shifts; avoid moving up into my own torso unless a clear safe path to (5,5) opens.\n\nRIGHT",
