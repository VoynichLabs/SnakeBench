This is an immediate point.\n- DOWN: Would put me at (6, 3), which is safe but moves away from apples.\n- LEFT: Would put me at (5, 4), which is safe but not immediately toward any apple.\n- RIGHT: Would put me at (7, 4), which is safe but puts me adjacent to the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy analysis:\n1. UP would let me capture the apple at (6, 5) immediately. After that, I could potentially go for the apple at (6, 7).\n2. The enemy snake is at (7, 5), which means if I go UP, we'll be adjacent. This introduces some risk but isn't immediately dangerous.\n3. After capturing the apple at (6, 5), I'd be in a position to potentially move toward the apple at (6, 7) or move away from the enemy snake depending on its next move.\n\nThe UP move is clearly the best option as it:\n1. Immediately captures an apple\n2. Puts me in position to potentially capture another apple at (6, 7)\n3. While it brings me adjacent to the enemy snake, it doesn't put me in immediate danger\n\nFor my next turn strategy: After moving UP and capturing the apple at (6, 5), I'll need to evaluate the enemy snake's position. If it moves away from me, I might consider moving UP again toward the apple at (6, 7). If it moves closer or in a threatening way, I might need to move LEFT or DOWN to create distance.\n\nUP"
