So UP is not viable.\n\u2022 DOWN would lead to (5,8), but that\u2019s our body (and it would be like reversing on ourselves), which is forbidden.\n\u2022 LEFT would take us to (4,9). That space is empty, but it directs us away from the attractive apple on the right.\n\u2022 RIGHT moves us to (6,9), which is safe and moves us closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nSince our aim is to accumulate more apples and points while avoiding collisions and walls, moving RIGHT seems like the best decision. It keeps us within bounds and on course to reach the nearby apple at (8,9) on the top row.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

So UP is not viable.\n\u2022 DOWN would lead to (5,8), but that\u2019s our body (and it would be like reversing on ourselves), which is forbidden.\n\u2022 LEFT would take us to (4,9). That space is empty, but it directs us away from the attractive apple on the right.\n\u2022 RIGHT moves us to (6,9), which is safe and moves us closer to the apple at (8,9).\n\nSince our aim is to accumulate more apples and points while avoiding collisions and walls, moving RIGHT seems like the best decision. It keeps us within bounds and on course to reach the nearby apple at (8,9) on the top row.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Our possible moves from the current head at (5,9) are:\n\n\u2022 UP \u2192 Would go to (5,10), which is off the 10\u00d710 board.\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 This would be going back into our neck at (6,9), which is not allowed.\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 Moving to (4,9) is an option.\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 Moving to (5,8) is also an option.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider our targets. Our available apples are at: (0,7), (0,1), (8,3), (4,4), and (9,4). The apple at (4,4) remains a prime target. Let\u2019s evaluate the Manhattan distances:\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4,9):\n\u2003 Distance to the apple at (4,4) = |4\u20134| + |9\u20134| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5,8):\n\u2003 Distance to the apple at (4,4) = |5\u20134| + |8\u20134| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nBoth moves yield the same Manhattan distance to our target apple. So what other factors can influence our decision?\n\nLooking at the board:\n\u2003 Row 9: \n\u2003\u2003 Columns: 0 . , 1 . , 2 . , 3 . , 4 . , 5 1 (our head previously) , 6 ? (our body?) , 7 T? etc.\n\u2003 Row 8:\n\u2003\u2003 It shows some \u201cT\u201d (likely enemy or our tail) in several positions. In particular, column 5 on row 8 is empty.\n\u2003 Row 9 at column 4 (i.e., (4,9)) is also empty based on the board.\n\nHowever, by moving DOWN to (5,8), we position ourselves with additional options to navigate around potential obstacles or enemy snake parts. The enemy snake\u2019s head at (4,5) and its body nearby may become an issue if we become trapped. Heading DOWN now (to (5,8)) seems like a safer, more flexible move for future turns.\n\nThus, our next move will be DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

Our own body occupies (7,9) and (6,9) so going left would immediately bite ourselves, and going up would take us off the board (y=10). That leaves RIGHT and DOWN as safe choices.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we head to (9,9). While (9,9) isn\u2019t an apple (note the apples are at (9,0), (9,5), (5,6), (1,8), and (8,5)), it is a non\u2010threatening open square. (Later we\u2019ll need a plan since being at the far right means our next move can\u2019t be right or up, and we\u2019d be forced to go down to avoid the wall.) Alternatively, moving DOWN takes us to (8,8). That move keeps us away from the board\u2019s boundary, but doesn\u2019t guide us toward any specific apple right away.\n\nWith the enemy snake far away and no immediate risk of trapping ourselves, heading RIGHT to (9,9) remains an acceptable plan. It preserves our safe directions afterward as we can then reorient our path to target an apple later. I\u2019ll note as a future strategy that once we\u2019re near the board edge we\u2019ll need to be careful with our next move choices\u2014likely heading DOWN from (9,9) to keep our options open for reaching, say, the apple at (9,5) eventually.\n\nThus, for the next move, I decide to go RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

We have apples at (0,7), (0,1), (8,3), (9,4), (7,8). Notably, the apple at (7,8) lies just above and to the right of us. If we move RIGHT to (7,5), our path to (7,8) looks promising: on a subsequent turn, we can progress upward toward that apple. Additionally, moving right keeps us positioned away from our own tail and provides several escape routes if needed.\n\nWhile going UP (to (6,6)) is safe, it doesn\u2019t immediately set us on a direct course toward an apple, so RIGHT still appears to be the stronger option.\n\nThus, after considering the board layout, apple positions, and risks, our best next move is:\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake\u2019s head at (4,5) and its body nearby may become an issue if we become trapped. Heading DOWN now (to (5,8)) seems like a safer, more flexible move for future turns.\n\nThus, our next move will be DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
