This is where my tail segment is located\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN or LEFT.\n\nLooking at my strategy: I'm on the top row with two more apples available at (4, 9) and (0, 9). The most efficient path would be to continue LEFT along the top row to collect these apples in sequence. This keeps me in a relatively safe corridor away from the enemy snake #1, which is still at the bottom of the board at (7, 2).\n\nThe enemy snake is far away and moving in the bottom area, so there's no immediate threat. Continuing LEFT will take me toward the apple at (4, 9), which is 4 moves away if I go straight.\n\nStrategy for upcoming turns: Continue moving LEFT along the top row (y=9) to systematically collect the apples at (4, 9) and then (0, 9). This gives me a clear path with guaranteed food while staying away from the enemy snake. The top row acts as a safe highway for now.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT"
