I should move towards it while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away at (0, 5) with its body at [(0, 6), (1, 6)], so it doesn't pose an immediate threat. However, I need to be cautious and avoid getting trapped.\n\nStrategy: Move up towards the apple at (3, 8). After reaching it, I'll reassess the board and consider the apples at (9, 2) and (2, 2) as potential targets. I should prioritize staying in the upper part of the board to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake and avoid getting trapped.\n\nMy next move is: UP."

That's where my body is\n- DOWN: Goes to (0, 4) - safe, continues toward the apple at (1, 3)\n- LEFT: DEATH! Wall collision (x would be -1)\n- RIGHT: Goes to (1, 5) - safe, but this moves away from my planned path to (1, 3)\n\nFollowing my strategy from last turn, I want to continue moving DOWN to get to y-coordinate 3, then move RIGHT to collect the apple at (1, 3). This is still the most efficient path to the nearest apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 4), next turn I can go DOWN again to (0, 3), then RIGHT to (1, 3) to get the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN to (0, 4), then next turn go DOWN to (0, 3), then RIGHT to grab the apple at (1, 3).\n\nDOWN"
