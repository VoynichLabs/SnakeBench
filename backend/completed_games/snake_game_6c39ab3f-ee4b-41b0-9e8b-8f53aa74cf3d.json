That would be a head-on collision; both snakes die and, since apples are tied 1–1, the game likely ends in a draw. Even if they move DOWN instead, we end up closer to them with fewer safe follow-ups.\n- RIGHT → (8,9): apple. Enemy cannot reach (8,9) this turn from (5,9), so no head-on possible. We gain +1 apple (lead 2–1) and end up with safe follow-ups (DOWN to 8,8 or RIGHT to 9,9 next turn).\n\nRIGHT is the only move that both avoids any immediate kill scenarios and improves our score/position. LEFT introduces a possible head-on when a strictly safer, better-scoring move exists.\n\nLong-term note to self:\n- Take the apple at (8,9) now.\n- Next turn, decide between DOWN to 8,8 (toward center apples and more space) or RIGHT to 9,9 depending on where Snake #1 goes (likely toward the (5,7) apple via 5,8). Prefer lines that keep distance and open space over hugging the top edge too long.\n\nRIGHT",
