I also see that the enemy snake #1 is at position (9, 9) but its body is empty, so it's not a threat yet.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the nearest apple, which is at (9, 1). However, I need to be careful because I'm at (2, 9) and moving directly to (9, 1) would be a long way. I also need to consider the enemy snake's position and the fact that I'm at the top of the board.\n\nHmm, I think I'll move to the right first and then try to move up. If I move right, I'll be at (3, 9), which is closer to the apple at (9, 1). Then, I can try to move up to (4, 9) and then continue moving up and right to reach the apple.\n\nBut wait, I see that there's an apple at (3, 3) which is closer to my current position. I can move down to (2, 8) and then move right to (3, 8) and then up to (3, 9) and then up to (3, 3) to get the apple.\n\nOkay, I think I have a plan. My next move is: RIGHT."
