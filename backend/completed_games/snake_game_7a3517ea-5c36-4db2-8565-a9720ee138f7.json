If the enemy moves toward you, they could collide. But since both snakes move simultaneously, we need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n  - Enemy could move left (to (7,5)), right (to (9,5)), up (to (8,6)), or down (to (8,4)). If enemy moves left to (7,5), they could collide with your head at (9,8) if you move up. But since they move first, this is unlikely to cause immediate death. Still, this is risky because the enemy could be aggressive.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases):**\n  - Moving from (9,7) down to (9,6) is valid.\n  - No immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n  - This move keeps your head closer to the apple at (9,5), which is a direct reachable apple.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases):**\n  - Moving from (9,7) left to (8,7) is valid.\n  - No immediate collision with enemy or own body.\n  - This move keeps your head in the middle column, which is a safer position to maneuver around the board.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases):**\n  - Moving from (9,7) right to (10,7) is invalid (off the board). So this move is unsafe.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate remaining safe moves\n- **UP:** Leaves you vulnerable to enemy collision if enemy moves aggressively. Not ideal.\n- **DOWN:** Directly moves toward the apple at (9,5). This is a good short-term gain.\n- **LEFT:** Keeps you in a safer position, but doesn't immediately eat an apple.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider future options\n- If you move **DOWN**, you will be at (9,6) next turn. From there, you can move toward the apple at (9,5) or explore other paths.\n- If you move **LEFT**, you will be at (8,7) next turn. This is a safer position, but you won't immediately eat an apple. You can then explore other directions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Prioritize immediate gains and safety\n- Moving **DOWN** is the best immediate move because it will allow you to eat the apple at (9,5) in the next turn. This will increase your score and reduce the enemy's advantage.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan for future turns:\n1. **Next turn:** Move DOWN to eat the apple at (9,5). This will grow your snake and increase your score.\n2. **After eating the apple:** Your body will be at (9,6), and your head at (9,5). From here, you can continue moving DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5) to avoid the enemy.\n3. **Enemy's potential moves:** The enemy is at (8,5). If they move LEFT to (7,5), they could block your path if you move LEFT. So, moving DOWN is safer in the long run.\n4. **Avoid collisions:** Keep your head away from the enemy's potential paths. If the enemy moves aggressively, moving DOWN will keep you safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final decision:\n**DOWN** is the best move to eat the apple at (9,5) and grow your snake safely.\n\nDOWN",

This would give me 1 point immediately.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT moves would get me an apple immediately. Let me consider the enemy snake's position more carefully:\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (9, 7). They could potentially move DOWN to (9, 6), which would put them between me and the apple at (9, 5) if I move RIGHT. If I move LEFT to (7, 5) to eat that apple, the enemy snake cannot interfere with that path.\n\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (9, 5), that would put me directly below the enemy snake, which could be dangerous if they move DOWN on their next turn.\n\nBetween the two apple options, LEFT seems safer as it avoids potential future conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Long-term plan**: I should prioritize the immediate apple at (7, 5) by moving LEFT. This gives me a point and moves me away from the enemy snake's potential path. After eating this apple, I can assess the board and consider moving toward the cluster of apples on the left side (0,4) and (1,4) while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, no: current head is at (9,5), body at (9,6). Moving DOWN would be (9,5) \u2192 (9,6), but (9,6) is your body, so this is a **death move** (backwards collision).\n   - **Correction:** Current head is at (9,5), body at (9,6). Moving DOWN would be (9,5) \u2192 (9,6), which is your body \u2192 **immediate death**. So **DOWN is invalid**.\n   - **LEFT:** (9,5) \u2192 (8,5).

This keeps me safe from the enemy snake's potential paths (LEFT to (8, 5) would be blocked by my body at (7, 5)) and moves me closer to the apple at (6, 3). The apple at (6, 3) is 1 cell south from (6, 4), so I can reach it on my next turn if available. Moving DOWN also opens up paths toward the apple cluster on the left side of the board via subsequent LEFT moves.\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP to (5, 4) or LEFT to (4, 3) both position me to continue toward these apples. UP is slightly better as it positions me to potentially collect (4, 4) on the next move if I can get there before the opponent. Moving UP keeps my options open for both LEFT and RIGHT moves on subsequent turns, while avoiding the deadly RIGHT move into my own body.\n\nUP",

Wait, no\u2014(4,1) is at (4,1), so from (1,6), the shortest path is:\n    - **LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT \u2192 LEFT** (5 LEFTs): (1,6) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) [invalid], but (0,4) is an apple. Wait, no, (4,1) is at column 4, row 1. From (1,6), the Manhattan distance is (4-1) + (1-6) = 3 + 5 = 8 steps, but since you can only move one direction at a time, it\u2019s **8 turns** if you go straight. But if you zigzag, it\u2019s longer. The closest is (0,4) (distance 5) and (4,1) (distance 8). Wait, let\u2019s recalculate:\n    - **Distance to (0,4):** |0-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3 turns.\n    - **Distance to (4,1):** |4-1| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8 turns.\n    - **Distance to (7,0):** |7-1| + |0-6| = 6 + 6 = 12 turns.\n    - **Distance to (8,7):** |8-1| + |7-6| = 7 + 1 = 8 turns.\n    - So (0,4) is the closest (3 turns). But (4,1) is now reachable in **one LEFT move** if you go (1,6) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) (but that\u2019s 3 LEFTs). Wait, no: from (1,6), moving LEFT 4 times would take you to (1-4,6) = (-3,6) [invalid]. So the only way to reach (0,4) is via (1,6) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) (3 LEFTs). But (4,1) is at (4,1), so from (1,6), the path is:\n      - LEFT \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) [invalid], or\n      - RIGHT \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,1) [apple].\n    - So the shortest path to (4,1) is **8 turns** (RIGHT 4, DOWN 3). But (0,4) is reachable in **3 LEFTs**. So (0,4) is closer.\n    - Wait, no: (0,4) is at (0,4), so from (1,6), the path is:\n      - LEFT \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) [3 LEFTs].\n    - So (0,4) is indeed the closest (3 turns). But (4,1) is not reachable in fewer than 8 turns. So prioritize (0,4).\n\n- **Last move:** UP \u2192 (1,6) from (1,5). Body now at (1,5) and (2,5). Apple (0,4) is now reachable in **one LEFT move** (from (1,6) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4)), but that\u2019s 3 turns. Wait, no: from (1,6), moving LEFT once is (0,6). Then LEFT again is (0,5), then LEFT again is (0,4). So **3 LEFTs total**. But if you move LEFT now, you\u2019d go to (0,6), then next turn LEFT to (0,5), then LEFT to (0,4). But you can\u2019t move LEFT twice in one turn. So the immediate next move is just one direction. So if you move LEFT now, you\u2019d go to (0,6), and then next turn you\u2019d need to move LEFT again to reach (0,4). But (0,4) is still 2 turns away from (0,6). So no, (0,4) is not reachable in one move. The closest is (4,1), which is 8 turns away. So (0,4) is still the closest (3 turns).\n\n### **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n- **Head:** (4,4) [from last turn\u2019s info, but earlier it was (2,2)]. Wait, the last turn\u2019s info says your snake\u2019s head was (1,5), body [(2,5), (3,5)]. Enemy\u2019s head is at (4,4), body [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)].\n- **Threats:**\n  - Enemy\u2019s head is at (4,4). Possible next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    - UP: (5,4) [valid, no immediate danger].\n    - DOWN: (3,4) [valid, but (3,4) is adjacent to your body at (3,5) and (2,5). If enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), it could block your path to (0,4) if you try to go LEFT].\n    - LEFT: (4,3) [valid, but (4,3) is adjacent to your body at (4,5) [no], but (4,3) is not directly adjacent to your body. Wait, your body is at (1,5) and (2,5). So no immediate danger].\n    - RIGHT: (5,4) [valid, no immediate danger].\n  - Enemy\u2019s body is spread out, but the most immediate threat is if it moves to (3,4) or (4,3), which could block your path to (0,4) if you try to go LEFT.\n\n### **Safe Moves (After Eliminating Deaths):**\n1. **UP:** (1,6) \u2192 (1,7)\n   - **Pros:** Keeps body safe. Moves toward (7,0) apple (distance ~6 \u2192 ~5 turns). Avoids immediate collision with enemy.\n   - **Cons:** Slower progress toward (0,4), but safer long-term.\n\n2. **LEFT:** (1,6) \u2192 (0,6)\n   - **Immediate death risk:** No, but (0,6) is adjacent to the board edge (x=0 is valid). Your body is at (1,5) and (2,5). Moving LEFT to (0,6) is safe, but next turn you\u2019d need to move LEFT again to reach (0,4). Enemy could move to (3,4) or (4,3), blocking your path if you try to go LEFT again.\n   - **Pros:** Moves you closer to (0,4) (distance now 2 turns: (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4)). But enemy could block.\n\n3. **DOWN:** (1,6) \u2192 (1,5)\n   - **Immediate death risk:** Your head would collide with your body at (1,5). Invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** (1,6) \u2192 (2,6)\n   - **Immediate death risk:** No, but your body is at (1,5) and (2,5). Moving RIGHT to (2,6) is safe, but it doesn\u2019t help with apple proximity. Enemy could move to (2,6) or (3,6), but (3,6) is not on the board (y=6 is valid, but x=3,y=6 is valid). Wait, (3,6) is valid (board is 10x10, y=0 to 9). But enemy\u2019s body is at (1,3), (2,2), etc., so no immediate danger.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n- **LEFT** is the best immediate move because it gets you closer to the closest apple (0,4) in **two turns** (from (1,6) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4)). While enemy could block, the risk is manageable because the alternative is moving UP, which is slower. Also, moving LEFT doesn\u2019t immediately threaten your body.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Turns 1-3):**\n1. **Turn 1:** LEFT \u2192 (0,6) to start moving toward (0,4).\n2. **Turn 2:** LEFT \u2192 (0,5) to get closer to (0,4).\n3. **Turn 3:** LEFT \u2192 (0,4) to eat the apple and grow.\n\n---\n**Final move:** LEFT",

The closest apple is at (0, 4) which is 4 cells away to the left/up. Moving LEFT to (3, 4) brings me closer to that apple and keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available. Moving UP would also be safe but doesn't bring me closer to any immediate scoring opportunities. Moving RIGHT would take me away from the nearest apple. Among these safe options, moving LEFT to (3, 4) seems most promising as it progresses toward the apple at (0, 4).\n\nLEFT",

This keeps you in a neutral position while the enemy\u2019s head at (4,4) is still far.\n\n### **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n- **Head:** (4,4)\n- **Threats:**\n  - Enemy\u2019s head is at (4,4). Possible next moves:\n    - **UP:** (5,4) \u2192 Valid, no immediate danger.\n    - **DOWN:** (3,4) \u2192 Could block your path if you try to move LEFT toward (0,4).\n    - **LEFT:** (4,3) \u2192 Adjacent to your body at (1,6), but no direct collision risk yet.\n    - **RIGHT:** (5,4) \u2192 Valid, no immediate danger.\n  - Enemy\u2019s body is spread out, but the most immediate concern is if it moves to (3,4) or (4,3), which could block your path.\n\n### **Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP:** (0,7) \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 **Invalid** (off-board). So, no.\n2. **DOWN:** (0,7) \u2192 (1,7)\n   - **Pros:** Keeps you safe from enemy threats, avoids immediate collision risks, and doesn\u2019t block your path to (0,4) in the future.\n   - **Cons:** Slower progress toward (0,4), but safer long-term.\n\n3. **LEFT:** (0,7) \u2192 (0,6)\n   - **Immediate death risk:** No, but enemy could move to (3,4) or (4,3), blocking your path if you try to move LEFT again.\n   - **Pros:** Gets you closer to (0,4) in the next turn.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** (0,7) \u2192 (1,7)\n   - **Immediate death risk:** No, but your body is at (1,6), so moving RIGHT would collide with (1,7) if it exists. No, invalid.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n- **DOWN** is the safest move. It avoids immediate enemy threats and keeps your body in a neutral position. Moving LEFT risks enemy interference, and UP is invalid.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- **Turn 1:** DOWN \u2192 (1,7)\n- **Turn 2:** LEFT \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) (if safe)\n- **Turn 3:** LEFT \u2192 (0,5) to eat apple.\n\nDOWN\n---",

I would die by moving into my own body.\n\n## Enemy snake analysis\n\nEnemy snake #1 at (0, 7) with body [(0, 6), (1, 6)] could potentially move:\n- UP to (0, 8) - moves away from me and doesn't collect an apple\n- DOWN to (0, 6) - would move into its own body and die\n- LEFT to (-1, 7) - would move off the board and die\n- RIGHT to (1, 7) - moves away from me and doesn't collect an apple\n\n## Long-term plan\n\nThe nearest apple is at (0, 4), which is 2 cells away. Moving LEFT to (1, 4) brings me closer to that apple and keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available. Moving UP or DOWN would be safe but doesn't bring me closer to any immediate scoring opportunities. Among the safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT), moving LEFT to (1, 4) is the best choice as it progresses toward the apple at (0, 4) while avoiding my own body.\n\nLEFT",
