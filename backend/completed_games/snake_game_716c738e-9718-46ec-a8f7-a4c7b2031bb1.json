Therefore, I'll proceed with cautiously approaching the apple while maintaining awareness of my body's trajectory and the opponent's movements. \n\nTo accomplish this, my next move would be to head RIGHT to (3, 6), then move DOWN to (3, 5), which will allow me to shift eastward while keeping a downward trajectory. This strategy should help me build momentum while minimizing risks until I can reach the apple at (9, 0) or reassess my route if new information arises.\n\nRIGHT, DOWN.",
