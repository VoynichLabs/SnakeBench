You have 0 apples.\n- **Apples**: Located at (4, 3), (0, 8), (4, 5), (2, 3), (0, 6).\n- **Enemy Snake**: Head at (1, 4), no body segments.\n\n### Immediate Safety Check:\n1. **Off the board**: Moving up from (6, 0) would take you to (6, 1), which is within bounds. Other directions (down, left, right) are also safe since the board is 10x10 and coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9).\n2. **Into own body**: Since your snake has no body segments, moving in any direction is safe from self-collision.\n3. **Into enemy body**: Enemy snake has no body segments, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Safe Moves:\nAll four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe at this moment.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy:\n- The closest apples are at (4, 3) and (2, 3), both 2 cells away horizontally from your head (6, 0).\n- Moving **LEFT** would take you to (5, 0), then (4, 0), and finally (4, 3) in the next two turns, allowing you to eat the apple at (4, 3) safely.\n- Moving **UP** would take you to (6, 1), which is not adjacent to any apple.\n- Moving **DOWN** would take you to (6, -1), which is off the board (invalid).\n- Moving **RIGHT** would take you to (7, 0), which is not adjacent to any apple.\n\n### Enemy Movement Consideration:\n- Enemy snake is at (1, 4). It will move this turn, but since it has no body, it can move freely. However, since it has no body, it cannot block any cells, so no immediate threat from enemy movement.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Short-term**: Prioritize moving LEFT to reach the apple at (4, 3) in the next two turns.\n- **Mid-term**: Once you have a body, ensure you don't get trapped or collide with the enemy snake. Avoid moving into tight spaces where you might be forced into a collision.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe move that maximizes immediate apple collection while keeping options open is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

Current Snake State & Board Setup**\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: `(4, 0)`\n  - Body: `[]` (empty)\n  - Apples collected: `0`\n- **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n  - Head: `(2, 3)`\n  - Body: `[(2, 4)]`\n  - Apples: `1`\n- **Apples available:**\n  - `(4, 3)`, `(0, 8)`, `(4, 5)`, `(0, 6)`, `(7, 9)`\n\n#### **2. Safety Check (No Immediate Death)**\n- **Possible moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n- **Left (current direction):**\n  - New head position: `(3, 0)`\n  - **Check for collisions:**\n    - No enemy body or tail at `(3, 0)` (safe).\n    - No risk of wrapping (board is 10x10, no edge issue).\n  - **No immediate death.**\n- **Other directions:**\n  - **UP:** `(4, 1)`\n    - No enemy body/tail at `(4, 1)` (safe).\n    - But this moves away from the closest apple `(4, 3)` (distance increases).\n  - **DOWN:** `(5, 0)`\n    - No enemy body/tail at `(5, 0)` (safe).\n    - Closer to `(4, 3)` (distance = 1 vs. 2 for LEFT).\n  - **RIGHT:** `(4, 1)`\n    - Same as UP (no immediate benefit).\n\n#### **3. Strategic Considerations**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Reach `(4, 3)` in the fewest turns.\n  - Current distance to `(4, 3)`:\n    - LEFT: `(3, 0)` \u2192 `(2, 0)` \u2192 `(1, 0)` \u2192 `(0, 0)` \u2192 `(0, 1)` \u2192 `(0, 2)` \u2192 `(0, 3)` \u2192 `(1, 3)` \u2192 `(2, 3)` \u2192 `(3, 3)` \u2192 `(4, 3)` (10 turns).\n    - DOWN: `(5, 0)` \u2192 `(5, 1)` \u2192 `(5, 2)` \u2192 `(5, 3)` \u2192 `(4, 3)` (4 turns).\n  - **Down is faster.**\n- **Enemy Movement:**\n  - Enemy is at `(2, 3)` with body at `(2, 4)`.\n  - If it moves LEFT to `(1, 3)` or RIGHT to `(3, 3)`, it could block your path.\n  - If it moves UP to `(2, 2)` or DOWN to `(2, 4)` (but `(2, 4)` is its body, so it can\u2019t move there).\n  - **Risk:** If enemy moves RIGHT to `(3, 3)`, it could block your path to `(4, 3)`.\n  - **Solution:** Move DOWN to `(5, 0)` first, then adjust if needed.\n\n#### **4. Follow-Up Moves**\n- If you move DOWN to `(5, 0)`:\n  - Next turn, you can move UP to `(5, 1)` or LEFT to `(4, 0)`.\n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to `(3, 3)`, you can still reach `(4, 3)` in 2 more turns.\n- If you move LEFT to `(3, 0)`:\n  - Next turn, you\u2019d be at `(2, 0)`, which is slower and more vulnerable to enemy movement.\n\n#### **5. Risk Assessment**\n- **Down is safer** because:\n  - It reduces distance to `(4, 3)`.\n  - It avoids immediate enemy interference (enemy\u2019s head is at `(2, 3)`, so moving DOWN doesn\u2019t risk collision).\n  - It keeps your body in a straight line, making it harder for the enemy to block.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next Turns)**\n**Turn 2:**\n- **Move:** UP to `(5, 1)`\n  - **Rationale:**\n    1. **Apple Proximity:** Now at `(5, 1)`, closest apple is `(4, 3)` (distance = 2 turns if you move UP \u2192 LEFT).\n    2. **Enemy Watch:** If enemy moves RIGHT to `(3, 3)`, you can still reach `(4, 3)` in 2 turns.\n    3. **Body Positioning:** Extend tail to `(4, 0)` to avoid wrapping or enemy collisions.\n- **Alternative:** If enemy moves UP to `(2, 2)`, you can move LEFT to `(4, 1)` to block its path.\n\n**Turn 3:**\n- **Move:** LEFT to `(4, 1)`\n  - **Rationale:**\n    1. **Apple Chase:** Now at `(4, 1)`, one step closer to `(4, 3)`.\n    2. **Enemy Block:** If enemy tries to move toward you, this position limits its options.\n    3. **Body Growth:** If you eat `(4, 3)` next turn, extend tail to `(3, 1)` to avoid future collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**DOWN**\n\n*(This move prioritizes speed toward the closest apple while minimizing risk to enemy interference.)*",
