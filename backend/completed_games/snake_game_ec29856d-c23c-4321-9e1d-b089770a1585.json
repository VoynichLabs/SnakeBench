Still safe, but doesn't seem immediately advantageous.\n*   **LEFT:** To (6, 5).  Gets me closer to moving towards the apple at (3,1), but increasing potential interactions with Snake 1.\n*   **RIGHT:** To (8, 5). Safe from Snake 1.\n\nMy priority is still to avoid Snake 1, which is directly below me. Moving RIGHT puts the most distance between us. There is an apple close by at (8,9).\n\nRIGHT",
