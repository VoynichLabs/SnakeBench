The bottom edge keeps escape routes open and reduces risk of a trap near the y=3 barrier dominated by the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Stay along the bottom edge as long as possible, slowly probe toward nearby apples if a safe rendezvous path exists, and avoid aggressive head-on collisions with the enemy. Prioritize survival over rapid apple chase unless a clear safe apple route emerges (e.g., toward (6,5) or (5,6) only if a safe path is available).\n\nLEFT",
