Remaining choices: UP or RIGHT.\n\nAssessment:\n- RIGHT (7,0) gives an immediate apple and opens a clear run along the bottom: (7,0) -> (8,0) -> (9,0) are apples clustered on row 0. Eating now increases score and length, and there is plenty of room to turn up later (e.g., from (9,0) to (9,1)). The enemy head at (1,6) is far; no risk of a head-on collision next turn.\n- UP (6,1) is safe and preserves a non-growing move, but it forgoes an easy sequence of 3 apples on the bottom row. Given I\u2019m trailing in apples (6 vs 10), maximizing safe apple pickup is important.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take the bottom-row apples: RIGHT to (7,0) now, then continue RIGHT to (8,0) and (9,0) if still available, then head UP from the edge into open space. Stay aware of the enemy moving in the top half; avoid getting boxed in by my own growing body by keeping an escape column available (prefer columns 6\u20139 to move upward).\n\nRIGHT",

UP and DOWN are safe but pass up an immediate apple and the strong nearby cluster. LEFT grabs (7,4) now and lets me chain into (6,4) and (5,4)/(6,3)/(6,5)/(5,5), maximizing apples while keeping escape options (I can always go down toward the bottom area and my tail after collecting a few).\n- There is no short-term collision risk with the enemy. Growing is acceptable here because the area to my left and down is relatively open; I will avoid hugging the right wall going forward.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Sweep left through the cluster: (7,4) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) and pick up nearby (6,3)/(6,5)/(5,5).\n- After grabbing 1\u20133 apples, steer down/left toward my tail corridor to create room and avoid being trapped against the right wall.\n- Continue monitoring enemy top-left movement; avoid head-on contests.\n\nLEFT",

Safe from immediate collision. Eating it increases my length but gives a useful follow-up: from (5,5) I can go to (4,5) or (6,5) (both apples) or retreat to open space above, keeping options open.\n- LEFT -> (4,4): empty and safe, but doesn't pick an apple immediately. It can lead to (4,5) next turn.\n- DOWN -> (5,3): empty and safe, but moves away from the nearby apple cluster and into more constrained space near my long body along the bottom/right.\n\nThere is no near-term head-on threat from the enemy (their head is at (0,6) far away). The best move balances scoring (to catch up: 13 vs 14) and preserving multiple exits. Taking the apple at (5,5) both increases my score and leaves me flexible to chain to (4,5) or (6,5) on subsequent turns.\n\nShort-term plan: take (5,5) this turn, then attempt (4,5) or (6,5) to chain apples. After grabbing a couple, avoid getting funneled against my own body along the right/bottom edge by steering back toward more open central space.\n\nUP",

This keeps maximal flexibility and doesn't grow, but passing up an adjacent apple when apples are contested seems suboptimal given enemy is nearby on the left side.\n\nEnemy head is at (0,5) and cannot reach the (4,5)/(3,5) corridor before I can; they are not an immediate head-on threat. Taking the apple at (4,5) gives me an immediate point advantage and leaves multiple follow-up options, while keeping space to continue toward (2,4) or move upward if needed to avoid being funneled by my body. Growing one segment now is acceptable because (4,5) still has multiple safe exits.\n\nShort-term plan: take (4,5) now, then move to (3,5) next to continue toward (2,4) apple or pivot upward to avoid getting boxed by my bottom/right body.

Offers multiple exits (4,7, 3,6, 5,6). Keeps options open and moves toward the less-contested top area with apples at y=9 and avoids immediate confrontation.\n- DOWN -> (4,4): legal and free. Has limited exits because (5,4) is occupied by my body; from (4,4) I mainly have (3,4) and (4,3) as safe continuations.\n\nTactical evaluation\n- Avoiding head-on and contested apples: moving LEFT heads toward (2,4) but the enemy can get there quicker. That would likely give them an apple and could create head-on or racing pressure in tight space.\n- Mobility and safety: UP gives the most flexible escapes and steers me toward open space and the top apple cluster (e.g., (5,9), (3,9) region) while not growing into my own body or walking into dead-ends.\n- Growth considerations: none of the legal moves eat an apple immediately, so tail will move and free up space behind me; I should avoid moves that push me into my own long right-side body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns)\n- Move UP now to (4,6) to maximize options and avoid contesting a apple the opponent can reach faster.\n- From (4,6) evaluate enemy's next move. If the enemy commits into the middle, pivot to the top apples (toward (5,9)/(3,9)). If the enemy retreats, consider swinging left afterward to pick up (2,4) later when it's safe.\n- Always keep at least two exits available and avoid getting funneled toward my long right-side body.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

In short: apple now but high chance of getting boxed in soon.\n\nEvaluate RIGHT (7,9, no apple):\n- Keeps me on the top row with multiple safe follow-ups (down to 7,8 or right to 8,9). I maintain freedom to approach the 9,9 / 8,9 apple cluster in a controlled way and avoid being forced into the narrow x=4 corridor. Enemy head is far away at (0,2), so little immediate head-on risk.\n- Not taking the apple this turn sacrifices one point now but preserves mobility and safety, which is more valuable in the midgame.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (7,9), then press along the top row (8,9 -> 9,9) to collect the high-value cluster while keeping at least two follow-up options each turn. Avoid entering the x=4 vertical corridor until it's safe or I can ensure exits.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating (9,9) will momentarily lengthen me so the tail won't move that turn, but the planned downward sweep avoids colliding with my own segments at (9,4)/(9,3).\n- DOWN to (8,8) is slightly more flexible in immediate escape options, but it forgoes a high-value apple and leaves the right-side apple cluster available for the opponent later.\n- No immediate head-on danger from Snake #1; their head is confined on the left side.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take the apple at (9,9) now (RIGHT).

After taking those three apples my tail will still be at (9,4) (it won't have moved during the growth turns), so I must not move further down into (9,4). From (9,5) I can move LEFT into (8,5) (empty) to escape and let the tail start advancing.\n- LEFT (to 8,8) keeps more immediate mobility but passes up a clear run of three apples and is less efficient for closing the score gap.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Sweep down the rightmost column collecting apples at (9,7), (9,6), (9,5).\n- After (9,5), move LEFT to (8,5) to avoid colliding with my stationary tail at (9,4) and regain freedom of movement.\n- Re-evaluate board and enemy movement after that sweep; stay clear of narrow corridors on the left side where the enemy is concentrated.\n\nDecision: \nDOWN",
