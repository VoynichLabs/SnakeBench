Moving left to (8, 3) has already been considered and dismissed, as it puts me too near the edge. Moving right to (10, 3) isn't possible, as the coordinate (10, 3) is out of bounds.\n\nConsidering moving down also presents risks. The path directly right to (9, 4) is not valid.

Growing too quickly might be risky, but an immediate path to growth has its benefits, especially if it means gaining distance from potential threats.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I want to ensure that I maintain as much open space as possible and keep SNake #0 under observation.

Moving right to (10, 3) isn't possible, as the coordinate (10, 3) is out of bounds.\n\nConsidering moving down also presents risks. The path directly right to (9, 4) is not valid.

Given the motion of Snake #0 is heading East for now, there's a possibility of a turn altering its trajectory soon; monitoring this could help in avoiding a cross-path predicament.\n\nNext turn strategy: Depending upon where Snake #0 goes next, I may aim to grab the apple at (0,7). To achieve this, a LEFT is likely required next turn if my trajectory stays consistent. Adjustments will be made based on the other snake's movements for defensive and offensive advantages.\n\nBeing flexible is key. I'm preparing to potentially adjust my path based on next-turn observations: either claim that apple or readjust based on dynamic board changes.\n\n**UP**",

Identifying Snake #0's position and its likely trajectories, given its current heading and limited vision of future moves, optimizing my position seems necessary. The apple at (5,8) can be intercepted by moving RIGHT since an immediate UP won't directly align me with it but would place me in a precarious position relative to Snake #0. Heading directly RIGHT could make me vulnerable or limit options for future moves considering the shrine's board layout and strategic apple placements. My last reasoning leaned towards an UP move for strategic positioning in mid-board flexibility; however, the current strategic recalibration necessitates a move that edges me closer to the apple directly but maintains flexibility. Moving UP seems still viable for a couple of turns but at this juncture, considering proximity and strategic advantage considering Snake #0, moving RIGHT appears tactical.\n\nStrategy thought for next turn: Observe Snake #0's maneuver, potentially aim for a diagonal approach leading to (5,8) unless a better opportunity presents itself due to Snake #0's movement unpredictability or alternative apple accessibility. An approach should maintain defensive positioning against the other snake while maximizing apple acquisition potential.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

An immediate RIGHT will not only inch me closer to the edge, but it also doesn't leverage the closer apple at (0, 7) or put me in a strategic position relative to my other goals or in response to Snake #0. Snake #0 is currently moving East but might turn any direction next, and given that they are relatively far from overlapping into my path or claiming any of the closer apples, my focus shifts towards optimizing my own path. Given the apple at (0, 7) is now naturally right within a direct UP or DOWN move after a potential RIGHT, I reevaluate.\n\nStrategically, a RIGHT move puts immediate gains further, whereas an UP could position me better on the board and closer to multiple apples with a subsequent move. I notice that by moving UP, next turn would enable me to potentially head WEST one turn after to acquire the apple at (0, 7) rather than aiming for a longer RIGHT series that might be less fruitful in the short term and engages with fewer immediate opportunities.\n\nTherefore, aiming for upward mobility improves my flexibility to alter course depending on how Snake #0 evolves. Defensive positioning by not fully committing myself to one side of the board seems prudent as it leaves me options to sweep across mid-board or downwards depending on how play evolves.\n\nHowever, my immediate thought crystallizes on minimizing edge risk and maximizing potential actions next turn. I'll aim primarily for flexibility and potential apple acquisition.\n\n**Next move: UP**\n\nStrategic thought for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #0's path and consider my current positioning after this move. If effective, I may aim to head WEST towards the apple at (0, 7). Alternatively, depending on Snake #0's action, reevaluating the board to see if a dip south after becoming vertical is a viable option for either taking the apple at (5,8) or positioning defensively could be prudent.

It also ensures I'm not in immediate risk of interaction with Snake #0 without completely slashing off my eastward maneuverability if needed.\n\nLooking ahead, it is essential to keep a watch on Snake #0's movement patterns and subsequent blocks it might create to interpreting my path. Given the motion of Snake #0 is heading East for now, there's a possibility of a turn altering its trajectory soon; monitoring this could help in avoiding a cross-path predicament.\n\nNext turn strategy: Depending upon where Snake #0 goes next, I may aim to grab the apple at (0,7).

Heading directly RIGHT could make me vulnerable or limit options for future moves considering the shrine's board layout and strategic apple placements.

Snake #0 is currently moving East but might turn any direction next, and given that they are relatively far from overlapping into my path or claiming any of the closer apples, my focus shifts towards optimizing my own path. Given the apple at (0, 7) is now naturally right within a direct UP or DOWN move after a potential RIGHT, I reevaluate.\n\nStrategically, a RIGHT move puts immediate gains further, whereas an UP could position me better on the board and closer to multiple apples with a subsequent move. I notice that by moving UP, next turn would enable me to potentially head WEST one turn after to acquire the apple at (0, 7) rather than aiming for a longer RIGHT series that might be less fruitful in the short term and engages with fewer immediate opportunities.\n\nTherefore, aiming for upward mobility improves my flexibility to alter course depending on how Snake #0 evolves. Defensive positioning by not fully committing myself to one side of the board seems prudent as it leaves me options to sweep across mid-board or downwards depending on how play evolves.\n\nHowever, my immediate thought crystallizes on minimizing edge risk and maximizing potential actions next turn.

It also ensures I'm not in immediate risk of interaction with Snake #0 without completely slashing off my eastward maneuverability if needed.\n\nLooking ahead, it is essential to keep a watch on Snake #0's movement patterns and subsequent blocks it might create to interpreting my path. Given the motion of Snake #0 is heading East for now, there's a possibility of a turn altering its trajectory soon; monitoring this could help in avoiding a cross-path predicament.\n\nNext turn strategy: Depending upon where Snake #0 goes next, I may aim to grab the apple at (0,7).

Moving left to (8, 3) has already been considered and dismissed, as it puts me too near the edge. Moving right to (10, 3) isn't possible, as the coordinate (10, 3) is out of bounds.\n\nConsidering moving down also presents risks. The path directly right to (9, 4) is not valid.

Growing too quickly might be risky, but an immediate path to growth has its benefits, especially if it means gaining distance from potential threats.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I want to ensure that I maintain as much open space as possible and keep SNake #0 under observation.

Snake #0 is currently moving East but might turn any direction next, and given that they are relatively far from overlapping into my path or claiming any of the closer apples, my focus shifts towards optimizing my own path.

Moving left ensures that should Snake #0 change paths drastically, I am not boxed into a corner and can choose fresh alternatives.\n\nAs for my next strategic move, after this turn, I'm eyeing the apple at (9, 0) for consolidation purposes, but the long-term strategy involves maintaining space control, primarily positioning myself in such a way that allows easy retreat or changes in direction, avoiding confinement and potential collision with Snake #0 or the edges.\n\nMy decided next move is: LEFT",

Currently, with the apple at (9, 9) and (0, 9) being a bit far off but still within possible reach, maintaining a centerboard presence is crucial.\n\nBy moving UP, I can reposition and have observatory control, with increased flexibility to pounce on any of the apples nearest to the center columns like (5, 8) later if needed.

The apple at (5,8) can be intercepted by moving RIGHT since an immediate UP won't directly align me with it but would place me in a precarious position relative to Snake #0. Heading directly RIGHT could make me vulnerable or limit options for future moves considering the shrine's board layout and strategic apple placements. My last reasoning leaned towards an UP move for strategic positioning in mid-board flexibility; however, the current strategic recalibration necessitates a move that edges me closer to the apple directly but maintains flexibility. Moving UP seems still viable for a couple of turns but at this juncture, considering proximity and strategic advantage considering Snake #0, moving RIGHT appears tactical.\n\nStrategy thought for next turn: Observe Snake #0's maneuver, potentially aim for a diagonal approach leading to (5,8) unless a better opportunity presents itself due to Snake #0's movement unpredictability or alternative apple accessibility.

Snake #0 is currently moving East but might turn any direction next, and given that they are relatively far from overlapping into my path or claiming any of the closer apples, my focus shifts towards optimizing my own path. Given the apple at (0, 7) is now naturally right within a direct UP or DOWN move after a potential RIGHT, I reevaluate.\n\nStrategically, a RIGHT move puts immediate gains further, whereas an UP could position me better on the board and closer to multiple apples with a subsequent move. I notice that by moving UP, next turn would enable me to potentially head WEST one turn after to acquire the apple at (0, 7) rather than aiming for a longer RIGHT series that might be less fruitful in the short term and engages with fewer immediate opportunities.\n\nTherefore, aiming for upward mobility improves my flexibility to alter course depending on how Snake #0 evolves. Defensive positioning by not fully committing myself to one side of the board seems prudent as it leaves me options to sweep across mid-board or downwards depending on how play evolves.\n\nHowever, my immediate thought crystallizes on minimizing edge risk and maximizing potential actions next turn. I'll aim primarily for flexibility and potential apple acquisition.\n\n**Next move: UP**\n\nStrategic thought for next turn: Keep an eye on Snake #0's path and consider my current positioning after this move.

It also ensures I'm not in immediate risk of interaction with Snake #0 without completely slashing off my eastward maneuverability if needed.\n\nLooking ahead, it is essential to keep a watch on Snake #0's movement patterns and subsequent blocks it might create to interpreting my path. Given the motion of Snake #0 is heading East for now, there's a possibility of a turn altering its trajectory soon; monitoring this could help in avoiding a cross-path predicament.\n\nNext turn strategy: Depending upon where Snake #0 goes next, I may aim to grab the apple at (0,7).
