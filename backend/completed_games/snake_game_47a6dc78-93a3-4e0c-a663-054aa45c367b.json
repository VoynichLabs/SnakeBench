Moving UP will land on that apple, give me a point, and grow my snake without any risk of colliding with enemy heads (they are far away at the bottom).  \n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from the nearest apple and reduce future upward options, while also not providing any immediate reward.  \n- Since UP keeps me safe, moves me closer to an apple, and preserves vertical space for future growth, it is the best choice this turn.\n\nShort\u2011term plan:\n1. Move UP to (6,9) and collect the apple there.  \n2. On the next turn I will be at (6,9) with a longer body; I should then consider moving RIGHT to (7,9) or staying near the top edge while planning a path toward the other apples at (0,7) and (2,6).  \n3.

After moving LEFT, my possible next moves would be LEFT or UP (2 options).\n- UP gives me three follow-up directions (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) and thus preserves more flexibility and escape routes while still allowing me to head left afterward.

I\u2019ll still be able to pivot left afterward to approach the left-side apples, but with more options to react if the opponent shifts.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move UP now to (3,1) to keep options open.\n- Then head left toward x=1 and go north to take (1,4) and then the (0,6)/(0,7) cluster.\n- Avoid entering or contesting x=6 while the opponent controls that column; only contest apples there if the opponent vacates or I have a clear advantage.\n\nUP",

Two consecutive *UP* moves would place us directly on that apple, giving us another point and extending the snake.  \n  - Moving *UP* keeps the head positioned on the same column (x=5), preserving vertical flexibility and avoiding the tight corridor that would result from heading left.  \n\n- **Future options:**  \n  - From (5,5) we can still go *UP* again to eat the apple at (5,6), *LEFT* to (4,5), *RIGHT* to (6,5), or *DOWN* back to (5,4) (the cell we just left, which will be vacated by the tail). This variety of safe follow\u2011up moves maintains a wide escape corridor.  \n\n- **Collision risk:**  \n  - Enemy snake\u202f#0 is far away at (2,0) with a long body that cannot reach (5,5) in a single turn, so a head\u2011on collision is implausible.  \n  - No other opponents are present, so the only collision concern is with our own body, which we have verified will not be entered.  \n\nConsidering all constraints, the safest and most rewarding move is **UP**.  \n\nUP",

Enemy #1 is already at y=6 and will likely take (3,6)/(4,9) faster if I stall, but I can still race upward to contest later apples.\n- Staying mobile is crucial: prefer a move that keeps multiple follow-ups open and avoids getting squeezed against my own long body on the left wall.\n- UP preserves room on both sides (x=2..4), keeps options to go left/right later, and moves me toward the higher-value apples.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue north while monitoring enemy #1\u2019s head.

Next turn re-evaluate enemy head movement: if the enemy commits toward those apples, avoid pushing into the pocket around x=3..6 and instead use vertical escapes (up/down) from column 2 to circle around or go for nearer low apples (4,3/4,1) if safe.\n- Avoid entering the enemy body cluster; prefer to contest open approaches to apples or fall back to open space on the left/top edges if the enemy becomes aggressive.\n\nRIGHT",

After eating the apple the snake will still have multiple viable directions for the next turn, keeping future options open. No enemy head is likely to occupy (8,6) this turn, so a head\u2011on collision is avoided. Therefore RIGHT is the optimal choice.\nRIGHT",
