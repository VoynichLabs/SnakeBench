This position is close to the other snake, and since **(3, 3)** is directly in front, the other snake may potentially move there first if it intends to grow.\n\t- **Moving RIGHT** would take me to **(6, 2)**, which is adjacent to an apple. The risk here is minimal because I don't need to move into my own body or into the other snake, but I need to make sure not to overshoot an apple.\n\t- **Moving LEFT** would take me to **(4, 2)**, but this doesn\u2019t seem to help in gaining an apple or improving my positioning.\n\t- **Moving DOWN** would take me to **(5, 1)**.
