Approaching the nearest apple is sensible, and the closest reachable target is (9,3), which is directly above two steps from our potential RIGHT move.\n\nBest immediate choice: RIGHT to (9,1) keeps options open, places us on a direct path to the apple at (9,3), and avoids potential entanglement with the enemy head this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Move toward the apple at (9,3) by going RIGHT now, then use UP moves to reach (9,3) next turns if safe. Monitor the enemy\u2019s responses (they may head toward nearby cells like (9,2)) and adjust route to avoid head-on collisions or getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

It also keeps future options open: after eating the apple we can move left across the board toward the other apples on the left side.\n\nPlan: Next turn move UP to (9,3) to eat the apple, then head left toward the cluster of apples around (3,7\u20119).\n\nRIGHT",
