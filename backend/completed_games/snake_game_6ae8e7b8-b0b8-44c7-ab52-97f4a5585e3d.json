We know the nearest apple is at (3,6) because the Manhattan distance is |5–3| + |8–6| = 2 + 2 = 4, which is closer than our other apple options.\n\n• To work toward (3,6), we need to move in a down‐left direction. Both LEFT (to (4,8)) and DOWN (to (5,7)) move us closer (each yields a Manhattan distance of 3 on the next turn), but moving LEFT positions us with a lower x‑coordinate so we can more directly continue toward (3,6) on subsequent moves.\n\n• There are no obstacles immediately to the left; board position (4,8) is free, and no enemy snake is nearby. Meanwhile, our enemy snake (#1) is on the upper right (with its head at (7,7) and body at (6,7)), so working in our left/down quadrant keeps us away from potential head‐to‐head issues.\n\nBased on this reasoning, our optimal strategy is to shift LEFT, and then plan on heading down (or down–left) in subsequent moves to reach the apple at (3,6).\n\nNext move: LEFT",

This appears to be the most efficient path to an apple.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6, 5), I should continue eastward toward the apple at (9, 5).

Let's analyze:\n\n1. UP (9, 2): This continues along the right edge, and while it doesn't immediately lead to an apple, it keeps my options open. I can then potentially move left and work my way toward the apples in the middle and left side of the board.\n\n2. DOWN (9, 0): This moves me closer to the bottom-right corner. While it brings me slightly closer to the apple at (6, 0), it could limit my movement options in future turns by putting me in a corner.\n\nComparing these options, moving UP seems safer as it avoids boxing myself into the corner. It gives me more flexibility for future moves and a better pathway toward the central part of the board where multiple apples are located.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\nAfter moving UP to (9, 2):\n1. I'll have options to continue upward or move left to (8, 2), though I'll need to check if my body has moved by then\n2. My long-term goal should be to navigate toward the cluster of apples in the middle of the board\n3. I need to be careful about the enemy snake which is currently on the left side of the board\n4. I should try to create a path that lets me collect multiple apples efficiently while avoiding getting trapped by my own body\n\nUP",
