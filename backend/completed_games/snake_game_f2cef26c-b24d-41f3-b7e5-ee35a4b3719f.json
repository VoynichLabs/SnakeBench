A . . . . . A . .\n8 . . . A . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 0 . . 1 . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . A . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . A . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- `0` = Your snake's head\n- `1` = Enemy snake's head\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Safe Moves\nYour snake is currently at (3, 5). The four possible moves are:\n1. **UP**: (3, 6)\n2. **DOWN**: (3, 4)\n3. **LEFT**: (2, 5)\n4. **RIGHT**: (4, 5)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n- **UP (3, 6)**: Check if (3, 6) is occupied by your body (none), enemy body (none), or enemy head (no). Also check if it's off the board (no). Safe.\n- **DOWN (3, 4)**: Check if (3, 4) is occupied by your body (none), enemy body (none), or enemy head (no). Also check if it's off the board (no). Safe.\n- **LEFT (2, 5)**: Check if (2, 5) is occupied by your body (none), enemy body (no), or enemy head (no). Also check if it's off the board (no). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (4, 5)**: Check if (4, 5) is occupied by your body (none), enemy body (no), or enemy head (no). Also check if it's off the board (no). Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Apple Proximity\nNow, let's see which move brings the snake closer to apples:\n- **UP (3, 6)**: Distance to nearest apple is 2 (vertical distance to (3, 8)).\n- **DOWN (3, 4)**: Distance to nearest apple is 1 (horizontal distance to (3, 8)).\n- **LEFT (2, 5)**: Distance to nearest apple is 3 (horizontal distance to (1, 9)).\n- **RIGHT (4, 5)**: Distance to nearest apple is 1 (horizontal distance to (4, 5) is not an apple, but (7, 4) is 3 units away, and (6, 1) is 5 units away). Wait, let's clarify:\n  - (4, 5) is not an apple, but moving right to (4, 5) is adjacent to (4, 5) which is not an apple. The closest apple from (4, 5) is (7, 4) or (6, 1), which are farther than (3, 4) to (3, 8). So, (3, 4) is better.\n\nWait, let's clarify the apples:\n- (3, 8) is 4 units away from (3, 5) if moving down to (3, 4) (1 unit closer).\n- (3, 8) is 3 units away from (3, 6) (2 units closer).\n- (3, 8) is 2 units away from (3, 7) (but we can't go to (3, 7) directly).\n\nSo, moving down to (3, 4) is closer to (3, 8) than moving up to (3, 6).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Avoid Enemy Moves\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 5). If the enemy moves right to (1, 5), it could collide with your snake if you move left to (2, 5). But since we don't know enemy moves, we assume they will try to avoid us.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy\n- Your snake is alone and has no body, so it's vulnerable. You need to grow quickly by eating apples.\n- The closest apple is (3, 8), which is 3 units away vertically. Moving down to (3, 4) is the best immediate move to get closer to it.\n- Avoid moving left or right, as the enemy could potentially block you.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n**DOWN**\n\n---",
