If the enemy dies by moving into your neck, you gain a clean advantage. If the enemy escapes, you maintain safety and near-term mobility.\n\nLong-term plan/notes:\n- After establishing a safe position, aim to gradually descend toward the apple at (4,0) by careful lateral moves (LEFT/RIGHT) to avoid getting boxed in, then DOWN when a clear path is available.
