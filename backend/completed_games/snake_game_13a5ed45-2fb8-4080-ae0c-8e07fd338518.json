The path to the apples at (5,8) or (8,8) might be quite long.\n- Moving DOWN to (7,2): Risk of proximity to the enemy at (6,1) if I go down and further in that direction.\n- Moving LEFT to (6,3): Safe, but perhaps not optimal as it doesn't bring me closer to apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,3): Purposeful move — I notice apples at (8,8), (8,6), and (8,8). Moving right gets me closer to the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nGiven the apples at (8,8), (8,6), and the current position at (7,3), moving RIGHT seems a promising approach to reach those apples swiftly. Moving RIGHT won't lead into a wall, and the path seems safe for now.\n\nNext, where are the other apples? \n- (5,8): to the northwest, requires moving left and up multiple times.\n- (0,5): far left, less optimal.\n\nFocusing on the closest high-value apples at (8,8) and (8,6):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n- A move RIGHT to (8,3): safe.\n- From there, I can plan to go UP towards (8,6) and (8,8).\n\nAlso, I need to avoid any potential conflicts from the enemy snake or walls.\n\nConclusion:\n- Moving RIGHT seems to be the best initial move to position myself toward the key apples while maintaining safety.\n\nNext, I'm planning to continue moving toward the right and then upwards to reach the apples on the right and top.\n\n**Decision**: Next move: RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

Snake #0 is at (7, 3), not threatening for next move.\n- No walls nearby.\n\n### 6) **Best Move**\n- To get closer to (8, 6), I should move UP, since increasing y gets me closer. Later, I may need to move RIGHT as well, but no need to go horizontal before vertical (otherwise, I'm just moving parallel to the apple).  \n- Check if UP is safe: (6,2). It's in bounds, not occupied.\n\n### 7) **Strategy for next turn:**  \n- Continue to prioritize the apple at (8, 6), but stay alert if the enemy moves toward it as well.\n- If the enemy moves right or up, consider racing them or diverting.\n\n---\n\n### **My next move:**  \nUP",

Yes: distance to (8, 6) becomes |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = **5**.\n\n### **Strategy for next turn:**  \n- Keep heading UP toward y=6, then head RIGHT toward x=8 for (8, 6) apple.\n- Watch enemy if they move north as well — if they head for (8, 6), may need to pivot, perhaps to (5, 8).\n- Keep body length in mind after eating apple.\n\n---\n\n**My move:**  \n**UP**",

Moving left would risk collision with the enemy snake's position. So moving LEFT is unsafe.\n\nWalls:\n- Our current position is well within the bounds, with no immediate wall threats.\n\nSafety considerations:\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,3) is safe and directly aligns us with both target apples.\n- After moving right, moving UP would bring us closer to (8,6) and then (8,8).\n\nStrategy:\n- Move RIGHT now to approach the apples.\n- Then plan to move UP to collect them efficiently.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

          "rationale": "Let's walk through the step-by-step thinking for the **current move**.\n\n---\n\n### **1) Current Position & State**\n- **I'm at:** (6, 3)\n- **My body:** empty (just the head); I can reverse if needed.\n- **Enemy at:** (9, 3) (Snake #0), no body.\n- **No other obstacles nearby.**\n\n---\n\n### **2) Apples**\nLocations:\n- (5, 8)\n- (8, 8)\n- (1, 8)\n- (8, 6)\n- (0, 5)\n\n---\n\n### **3) Manhattan Distance to Each Apple**\nFrom (6, 3):\n\n| Apple   | Distance |\n|---------|----------|\n| (5, 8)  | 1 + 5 = 6|\n| (8, 8)  | 2 + 5 = 7|\n| (1, 8)  | 5 + 5 =10|\n| (8, 6)  | 2 + 3 = 5|\n| (0, 5)  | 6 + 2 = 8|\n\n**(8, 6)** is still closest, distance 5.\n\n---\n\n### **4) Enemy Snake Analysis**\n- Enemy is at (9, 3). Could go up, down, left, or right.\n- If enemy goes up: (9, 4) – still far from my path.\n- If enemy heads left: (8, 3) but that's not conflicting with my path toward (8, 6).\n- **No immediate threat** from enemy.\n\n---\n\n### **5) Safe Move Analysis**\nFrom (6, 3):\n- **UP:** (6, 4). In bounds, not occupied.\n- **DOWN:** (6, 2). In bounds, not occupied, but moves away from apples.\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 3). In bounds, not occupied.\n- **LEFT:** (5, 3). In bounds, not occupied.\n\nAll moves are open.\n\n---\n\n### **6) Which Move Best Progresses Toward (8, 6)?**\n\nCurrent: (6, 3)  \nTarget: (8, 6)\n\n- Increase y (UP) gets me closer to the apple's y (3 → 6)\n- Increase x (RIGHT) gets me closer to apple's x (6 → 8)\n\nIf I move UP:\n- New: (6, 4)\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = **4**\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\n- New: (7, 3)\n- Distance to (8, 6): |8-7| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Both moves progress equally toward (8,6)!**\n\n#### But: which move to prefer?\n- Moving UP (y direction) keeps me more \"central\", making it easier to adjust toward (5,8) or (8,8) if needed.\n- Moving RIGHT would start heading toward the right edge, where the enemy is (though they are at y=3).\n\nAlso, by going UP, I remain clear of the enemy.\n\n---\n\n### **7) Final Move Selection**\n- **UP** keeps me on my current overall route toward (8, 6), keeps flexibility, and is 100% safe.\n- If nothing unexpected happens, keep going UP to y=6, then head RIGHT to x=8.\n- Maintain awareness of where Snake #0 is next turn; if they approach, may need to adjust target to (5, 8).\n\n---\n\n### **Self Strategy for Next Turn**\n- Keep moving UP until y=6, then move RIGHT toward (8, 6).  \n- Monitor enemy's position each turn in case of potential collision/cutoff.\n\n---\n\n**My move:**  \n**UP**",
