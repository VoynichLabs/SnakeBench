No bodies on either side. Apples exist but we focus on the enemy.  \n- Legal moves from (5,8): UP -> (5,9), DOWN -> (5,7), LEFT -> (4,8), RIGHT -> (6,8). None are immediate deaths (not off-board, not into any body). \u2705\n\nEliminate dumb plays: no immediate suicides here. But we still need to weigh options: edge risk, follow-up flexibility, and head-on risk (remember: tied scores \u2014 head-on = draw, so we avoid mutual death).\n\nMove evaluation (short & spicy):  \n- UP to (5,9): hits the top row \u2014 reduces future options (can't go further up). Feels cramped.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): gets closer horizontally to the rival (x=4). Could bait them, but puts us above them and near same column \u2014 slightly risky for unexpected head plays.  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): keeps open space, but drifts away from engagement and the juicy apples in the top-right; slower to box them.  \n- DOWN to (5,7): keeps maximum maneuverability (not on an edge), reduces vertical distance to opponent (closing from 4\u21923), and preserves multiple safe follow-ups. Best balance of aggression + safety.\n\nPlan (short-term strategy note for next turns):  \n- Move DOWN to close the gap without overcommitting to an edge. Next turns, look to cut off their horizontal escape by shifting left if they commit upward, or weave horizontally to corral them toward the board edge. Only force a head-on if we have more apples than them \u2014 right now scores are tied, so avoid mutual death. Stay flexible, prioritize moves that keep >=2 escape options.\n\nTime to make the play \u2014 let's close the gap, keep options open, and set up the trap.

No body segments \u2014 full mobility.  \n- Enemy head: (3,3) with body at (3,4) and (4,4). They\u2019ve got 2 apples, we\u2019ve got 0 \u2192 DO NOT trade a simultaneous head-on unless we\u2019re sure we win that KO. We\u2019re behind on score.\n- They CANNOT move UP into (3,4) because that\u2019s their own body. Their legal moves: LEFT (2,3), DOWN (3,2), RIGHT (4,3).\n\nConsider moves from (4,7):\n- UP -> (4,8): keeps altitude but drifts away from action. Safe but passive.\n- DOWN -> (4,6): moves straight toward the enemy\u2019s general area, keeps multiple escape options, and sets up a vertical approach to box them in later.\n- LEFT -> (3,7): aggressive horizontally but doesn\u2019t close vertical distance; risks overshooting when we want to pressure their options.\n- RIGHT -> (5,7): purely defensive/space; slows our ability to contest.\n\nSafety check: none of these are immediate deaths. No head-on risk this turn (we\u2019re far apart), but remember simultaneous moves next turn \u2014 avoid forcing a head-on while trailing on apples.\n\nStrategy note (for next turns):\n- Close vertically (DOWN) to approach their corridor. Stay flexible with at least 2 escape routes each move. Once we\u2019re closer and can corral them toward walls/our advantage without risking a mutual head-on, start narrowing their options. Use growth only to dominate space, not to gamble on a double-KO while behind.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 let\u2019s close the gap and start the box. You know the line.\n\nDOWN",

All three are survivable this turn, UP is dead.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Aggression + control: moving DOWN starts marching us toward them on x=3. They can\u2019t go up to meet us, so we won\u2019t be baited into a risky head-on right now. We force them to choose left or right immediately, shrinking their options.\n- Setup to box: once they pick a side, we can follow and cut off their horizontal escape or pivot to trap them into the wall/apples. Being above them on the same column is a premium position when their vertical mobility is zero.\n- Keeps options open: after DOWN we still have LEFT/RIGHT available next turn to pivot for the trap or to avoid a trap ourselves. We\u2019re not committing to a tight dead-end.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep descending the x=3 column toward y=1\u20132 while watching which way they commits (LEFT vs RIGHT).\n- If they go LEFT, pivot LEFT a couple moves to block their return; if RIGHT, pivot RIGHT. Avoid forcing a head-to-head until we\u2019re at least tied or have a clear KO.\n- Use growth opportunistically to seal exits; never corner ourselves with no escape.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the heat on and make this dude choke on his own tail.

Quick state scan and playmaking:\n\nQuick legality check\n- BACK (LEFT -> (3,3)) is illegal \u2014 that\u2019s our neck. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Legal moves: UP -> (4,4) [apple], DOWN -> (4,2) [empty], RIGHT -> (5,3) [empty].\n\nEnemy options and threat model\n- Opponent head at (5,1) with body occupying (4,1),(4,0),(3,0),(3,1). They can move UP (5,2), RIGHT (6,1), or DOWN (5,0). LEFT is into their body (illegal).\n- None of their single-turn moves can reach any of our three candidate squares this turn, so no immediate head-to-head risk if we pick UP/DOWN/RIGHT now.\n- But we must avoid setting up a forced simultaneous head-to-head next turn \u2014 they lead on apples, so DO NOT intentionally trade heads.\n\nEvaluating candidates\n- UP -> (4,4): eats an apple right now. Safe from immediate head collision. Gains length = more board control to start boxing them in. Keeps escape routes (LEFT is still neck, but RIGHT and DOWN remain open afterward). Good balance of aggression + safety. \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN -> (4,2): moves closer vertically but doesn\u2019t gain an apple. Could let us pressure them into the y=1 row, but gives fewer immediate advantages than grabbing the apple.\n- RIGHT -> (5,3): aggressive positional play above them; tempting. BUT risks creating a situation where if they go UP and we go DOWN at the same time we could trade or force ambiguous head collisions next turn \u2014 NOT ideal while trailing on score.\n\nDecision \u2014 short-term\n- Take the apple, grow, and increase our ability to box them later. We\u2019re behind on score, so avoid risky head-on trades; instead gain board control and length to start hemming them into the bottom-left pocket.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns)\n- After grabbing (4,4), pivot: use our extra length to control column x=4/x=5 and restrict their vertical escape. Force them toward walls and their own body by alternating pressure between DOWN (to threaten their neck row) and lateral moves to cut exits. If they overcommit and have to move into our body, we win \u2014 but avoid simultaneous head collisions while they have the apple lead. Keep at least one escape route open until we flip the score pressure.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 UP",

Keep at least one escape route open each turn while gradually boxing them toward their low-left body.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Grow into the apple cluster to outsize them, then compress their available space by cutting off escape routes (especially into x<5 / y<3).

This move aggressively claims the x=7 column, puts us above and to the right of the enemy, and pressures their vertical options. From (7,6) we retain multiple follow-ups (UP to expand, RIGHT to pressure apples/edge, or DOWN to contest their space) while keeping our body compact. It sets up a potential cage along x=7/x=6 if they try to climb, and lets us threaten apples on the right flank or bait them into a risky approach. We avoid immediate head-on (they're at 7,4), but we\u2019re close enough to force them into awkward choices next turn. Stay sharp: if they commit to a head-on next turn and we\u2019ve gained the apple lead, we can accept the collision; otherwise we\u2019ll back away to preserve life.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Occupy x=7, then evaluate: if they push up recklessly, use lateral moves to cut them off and force a one-way approach.\n- If we can safely pick up a nearby apple while keeping >1 escape route, go for it. If they try to trap, retreat up and circle back \u2014 don\u2019t give up your neck.\n- Always keep two non-backwards exits after the move so we don\u2019t get boxed.\n\nRIGHT",

If we step into their head-cell we open up dangerous swaps/head-on possibilities next turn \u2014 we\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 6), so we should NOT gamble on a potential head-on.\n- RIGHT -> (8,6) = legal and aggressive, pins toward the right flank/apples. Good pressure but keeps us close to the rival\u2019s column and can let them bait us into tighter space.\n- UP -> (7,7) = legal, clean, gives us 3 follow-up exits (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) and moves away from direct confrontation. Keeps options open and avoids tempting a head-on while we\u2019re down on score.\n\nRisk balance: we\u2019re trailing 4\u21926, so forcing a head-on only makes sense if we\u2019d win the collision \u2014 we don\u2019t. We need to preserve life, keep multiple exits, and slowly maneuver to box them later. RIGHT is tempting, but UP is the safer aggressive posture: maintains mobility, avoids immediate clash, and lets us pivot to trap the enemy in the next few turns once we gather space.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move UP to (7,7) now to keep >1 escape and deny the enemy easy upward space.\n- From there, watch their reaction: if they push up recklessly, cut across and cage along x=6/x=7; if they drop or flank, use lateral moves to corral and then pressure for apples or forced collisions only when we have the lead.\n- Never allow ourselves to be funneled into a single corridor \u2014 keep two open exits each move.\n\nUP",
