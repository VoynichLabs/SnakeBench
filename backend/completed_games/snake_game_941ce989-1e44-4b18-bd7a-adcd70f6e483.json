Moving up or down would not help me collect any apples. Moving left would take me closer to the apple at (0, 3), but it's not an apple yet. Moving right would take me closer to the apple at (5, 0), but it's also not an immediate advantage.\n\nHowever, if I move right and then up, I would be able to collect the apple at (5, 0) on the next turn. This strategy would allow me to grow and gain a point.\n\nSo, my strategy for the next turn is to move right, and then on the following turn, move up.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT."
