(1, 9). Enemy head is at (8, 4). He's way over there, so no immediate collision threat. But we gotta think long-term! \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet's check my moves:\n\n*   **UP:** (1, 9) -> (1, 10). YIKES! That's off the board! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. We can't do that. ELIMINATED.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 9) -> (1, 8). That's an empty cell. Safe. \u2705\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 9) -> (0, 9). That's an empty cell. Also safe. \u2705\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 9) -> (2, 9). Empty cell. Safe. \u2705\n\nSo our safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which one sets us up for the future? We need to think about controlling space and getting to those apples! \ud83c\udf4e I see apples at (0,7), (6,8), (9,7)... lots of options.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 2,9):** Puts us closer to the center and a cluster of apples on the right side of the board. Good options from there.\n*   **LEFT (to 0,9):** Puts us on the edge. Might limit our options a bit, but there's an apple at (0,7) below us.\n*   **DOWN (to 1,8):** Keeps us in the middle of the left side. Also a solid, centralizing move.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF: The enemy is on the right side (head at 8,4). We should start claiming the left side and center, grow a big body, and then push him against the wall. We want to get between him and the center of the board. Let's not rush to his side yet; let him come to us or get trapped.\n\nRIGHT feels like the most aggressive move towards controlling the board. It opens up more avenues and doesn't pin us to the edge. Let's take the center ground!\n\nHERE WE GO!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down the clip review real quick:\n\n---\n\n## ANALYZING THE BOARD \ud83e\udde0\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Me: Head at (8, 4) - middle right area, STRONG positioning \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy: Head at (1, 9) - top left, kinda isolated ngl\n- Both at 0 apples - it's GAME TIME\n\n**Map awareness CHECK:**\n- Enemy is WAY up north at y=9\n- I'm chilling at y=4 with solid board control\n- Apples scattered everywhere but WHO CARES - we're playing AGGRESSIVE MODE\n\n---\n\n## MOVE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLet me evaluate all four directions:\n\n**UP (8, 5):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (8,5), no obstacles, no body in the way, opens up the entire right side and top area. Good mobility.\n\n**DOWN (8, 3):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (8,3), also clear. Keeps me in the right corridor.\n\n**LEFT (7, 4):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (7,4), opens pathways. Could be useful for control.\n\n**RIGHT (9, 4):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (9,4), keeps me on the edge, still mobile.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC THINKING \ud83c\udfaa\n\nHere's the THING chat - the enemy is trapped up in the top left corner right now. I need to:\n1. **Control the board** - don't let him escape into the middle\n2. **Cut off his options** - force him into tight spaces\n3. **Build length faster** - eat apples and grow THICC\n\nLooking at the apple distribution, there's a nice cluster on the RIGHT side (8,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (9,7), (9,1), (9,3). If I push RIGHT and UP, I can monopolize that entire region while the enemy is stuck on the LEFT side!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN FOR CHAT:** Push aggressively toward the right-side apple cluster. Build length while keeping middle board control. Enemy can't reach those apples easily from (1,9). Once we're thicc and he's starving, we CLOSE THE TRAP and force the collision! \ud83e\udea4\n\n---\n\n## THE CALL \ud83d\udce2\n\nMoving UP to (8,5) - this gives me the BEST positioning to dominate the right side, keeps all future options open (can pivot up, down, or left), and starts the aggressive push toward that juicy apple cluster! \n\nEnemy's too far away to interfere with this turn. Let's BUILD MOMENTUM! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

CLEAN! No collisions, no throw. We're still alive and kicking!\n\n---\n\n## SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS \u2705\n\n**UP (8, 6):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (8,6), no body in the way, no enemy body there. CLEAR!\n\n**DOWN (8, 4):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (8,4), that's where we came from but we have no body yet so it's fine. CLEAR!\n\n**LEFT (7, 5):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (7,5), enemy is way up at (2,9), nothing blocking. CLEAR!\n\n**RIGHT (9, 5):** \u2705 SAFE - moves to (9,5), right on the edge but still in bounds. CLEAR!\n\nAll four moves are ALIVE moves! Now let's pick the BEST one strategically! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN \ud83c\udfaa\n\nHere's the THING chat - the enemy is still chilling up at (2, 9) in the top-left corner. He's ISOLATED! I need to:\n\n1. **Continue RIGHT-SIDE DOMINANCE** - there's a CLUSTER of apples up there: (8,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (9,7), (9,3). If I keep pushing UP and RIGHT, I can gobble these up FAST!\n\n2. **Build LENGTH before the enemy does** - he's gotta walk all the way across the board to get to my apples. I control the real estate!\n\n3. **Keep OPTIONS OPEN** - don't get trapped in corners. Stay flexible!\n\nLooking at my current position at (8, 5):\n- **UP (8, 6)** gets me CLOSER to the apple cluster at (8,8) and (6,8)! This keeps me on the OFFENSIVE! \ud83d\ude80\n- DOWN takes me away from the action\n- LEFT moves me toward mid-board (less efficient)\n- RIGHT moves me to (9,5), which is a good edge position but doesn't advance toward apples as quickly\n\n**THE CALL:** UP is the MOVE! We're pushing toward that (8,8) apple, building momentum, and keeping the enemy TRAPPED in the corner while we get THICC! \n\nEnemy can't stop us - he's too far away! By the time he walks over here, we'll already have multiple apples in our pocket and he'll be starving! \ud83e\udea4\n\n---\n\n## NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN FOR MYSELF \ud83d\udcdd\n\nKeep pushing UP and RIGHT to hoover up that right-side apple cluster. Once we hit 4-5 apples, start thinking about cutting off his escape routes. The goal is to grow FASTER, then use our length advantage to TRAP and FORCE a collision when we're ahead!\n\nUP",

My rival Snake #0 is way over at (8, 5). We need to start laying down the foundation for our DOMINANCE!\n\nFirst, let's check for INSTANT DEATH moves. What's around me?\n*   **UP:** (2, 9) -> (2, 10). That's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. Absolutely not.\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 9) -> (2, 8). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Looks safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 9) -> (1, 9). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Also safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 9) -> (3, 9). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe again.\n\nSo our viable options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow... STRATEGY TIME! \ud83e\udde0 Where's the enemy? At (8, 5). He's on the right side. We're on the left. We want to GROW and BOX HIM IN!\n\nLooking at the apples... there's a juicy cluster in the bottom-left quadrant: (0,0), (5,0), (7,0)... and another near me at (6,9), (9,7). But the enemy is closer to that top-right cluster.\n\nTHE PLAY: We need to claim territory. Going RIGHT to (3,9) feels too reactive, moving towards the enemy before we're big enough. Going LEFT to (1,9) pins us to the edge, which is risky long-term.\n\nGoing DOWN to (2,8) is the MOVE! It opens up the whole center-left of the board for us. From (2,8), next turn I can go DOWN again to grab the apple at (1,7)? Wait, no, check the board again... apple at (0,7) and (1,4) are down there! We can start a path down the left side, gobbling apples and building a WALL with our body between the enemy and the best territory!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF: Snake #0 is on the right. We are claiming the LEFT and CENTER. Next turn, consider moving DOWN or LEFT to start circling towards the apples in the bottom-left. Grow big and slowly push him against the right wall. DO NOT engage him directly until we have a length advantage! Let's get that CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nHERE WE GO, CHAT! LET'S START OUR EMPIRE!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS \ud83e\udde0\n\n**My Position:** Head at (8, 6) - I'm on the RIGHT SIDE, controlling premium real estate! \ud83d\udcaa\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (2, 8) - Still on the LEFT SIDE, far away from my zone!\n**Score:** 0-0 - We're EVEN, but not for long fam!\n\n---\n\n## SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS \u2705\n\nLet me verify I don't throw this turn:\n\n**UP (8, 7):** \u2705 SAFE - no body, no enemy, in bounds. CLEAR!\n**DOWN (8, 5):** \u2705 SAFE - we came from there but no body yet. CLEAN!\n**LEFT (7, 6):** \u2705 SAFE - mid-board, nothing blocking. CLEAR!\n**RIGHT (9, 6):** \u2705 SAFE - edge of board but still valid. CLEAR!\n\nALL ALIVE! Now let's get STRATEGIC! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN \ud83e\udea4\n\nChat, look at this board state - I've got APPLE CLUSTERS on my right side:\n- (8, 8) - TWO CELLS ABOVE MY HEAD!\n- (6, 8) - slightly left\n- (6, 9) - up there too!\n- (7, 9), (9, 7) - all in my zone!\n\nMeanwhile, enemy is stuck at (2, 8) on the opposite side. He's TRAPPED in the corner while I control the APPLE GOLDMINE! \u26cf\ufe0f\n\nHere's my thinking:\n- **UP (8, 7):** Gets me CLOSER to (8, 8)! I'm literally ONE MOVE away from that apple! This is AGGRESSIVE, this is CONTENT! \ud83d\ude80\n- **RIGHT (9, 6):** Moves me to the edge, but doesn't advance toward apples as quickly\n- **LEFT (7, 6):** Takes me AWAY from my apple cluster - that's a throw!\n- **DOWN (8, 5):** Also moves away from the action\n\nThe CALL is CLEAR, fam! We go UP, grab that (8, 8) apple next turn, start GROWING, and watch the enemy scramble to catch up! By the time he reaches my side of the board, I'll be a THICC boi with multiple apples in the bank! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\n---\n\n## NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 3 Strategy:** Keep pushing UP/RIGHT to vacuum the apple cluster. Grab (8, 8), then pivot to (6, 8) or (6, 9). Build length FAST - every apple we grab before the enemy gets even ONE is a MASSIVE advantage. Once we hit 3+ apples, we start looking for opportunities to TRAP and CONTROL the board. Enemy can't compete with us on our turf! Keep options OPEN - never get cornered!\n\n---\n\nUP",

We're still both small, BUT WE CAN'T GET COMPLACENT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nFirst, check for INSTANT DEATH moves. What's around (2, 8)?\n*   **UP:** (2, 8) -> (2, 9). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 8) -> (2, 7). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 8) -> (1, 8). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 8) -> (3, 8). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! This is where STRATEGY kicks in! \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhere's the enemy? At (8, 6). He's got a few options. He could go DOWN to (8, 5) towards an apple, or LEFT to (7,6). The CLOSEST apple to him is at (9,7) and (5,5). We need to think about where he WANTS to go.\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN (FROM LAST TURN): Claim the LEFT and CENTER. Grow big and push him against the right wall. So we should probably avoid heading RIGHT towards him right now. That just accelerates a conflict we're not ready for.\n\nLooking at apples... there's a beautiful cluster in the bottom-left! (0,0), (5,0), (7,0)... and one at (0,7) is real close! If we go DOWN to (2,7), we're on a path straight down that left side. If we go LEFT to (1,8), we're moving along the top-left edge, which feels a bit restrictive.\n\nHMM... BUT ALSO consider this: What if we go UP to (2,9)? That's the top edge. From there, we own the top-left corner. We can then work our way down the left side next turn. It might give us more options than starting lower down immediately.\n\nWAIT A MINUTE! \ud83e\udd2f Let's think about the ENEMY'S likely move. He sees apples at (9,7) and (5,5). The apple at (5,5) is kinda in the middle... He might go LEFT to (7,6) or DOWN to (8,5) to set up a path towards it. If he goes LEFT, he's moving towards the center. If we go RIGHT, we might run into him sooner than we want!\n\nSO THE SAFEST, MOST TERRITORY-CLAIMING MOVE is to go DOWN or LEFT, reinforcing our control of the left side. Going UP also works, but it pins us to the top edge.\n\nI think going DOWN to (2,7) is the move! It opens up the entire vertical column for us. Next turn, from (2,7), we can go DOWN again towards the apples at (1,4) and beyond, or LEFT/WEST to really hug that left wall. This continues our plan perfectly! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** We own the left side! Our body will start forming a barrier. Next turn, consider continuing DOWN or moving LEFT to (1,7) to grab the apple at (0,7). Keep an eye on Snake #0's position\u2014if he charges center, we need to grow faster than him! Avoid the right side for now.\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD... I MEAN, APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We gotta stick to the plan! \ud83d\ude24\n\nFirst, check for INSTANT DEATH moves. What's around (2, 7)?\n*   **UP:** (2, 7) -> (2, 8).

That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! Time for STRATEGY! \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhere's the enemy? At (8, 7). He's RIGHT on top of an apple at (9,7)! He's gonna want that! So he'll probably go RIGHT to (9,7) to eat it and grow. That's good for us! It pushes him further into the corner!\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN: DOMINATE THE LEFT SIDE! We have a juicy apple at (0,7) just a few moves away! If we go LEFT to (1,7), we're on a direct path to grab it next turn! That's CONTENT and GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWhat about the other moves?\n*   **UP:** Puts us at (2,8). Not bad, but it's away from the immediate apple prize.\n*   **DOWN:** Puts us at (2,6). Also fine, but there are more apples to the left and down the left side.\n*   **RIGHT:** Towards the center? NO! That's where the enemy might go after he eats. We avoid conflict until we're bigger!\n\nThe move is CLEAR! We go LEFT to (1,7)! This sets us up to grab the apple at (0,7) next turn, growing our body and starting our wall on the left edge! This is how we BOX HIM IN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** We're claiming the left wall! Next turn from (1,7), we go LEFT to (0,7) for the apple! Then we can consider going DOWN the left side to collect more apples. Keep the enemy pinned on the right! Let him have the right-side apples for now; we'll trap him later!\n\nLEFT",

I could be setting up a FEAST! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**RIGHT (9, 8):** Pushes me further right to the edge. Similar problem as UP - limited escape routes, getting CONFINED! Enemy could potentially CORNER me if I'm not careful!\n\n---\n\n## THE ENEMY SITUATION \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, look at Snake #1 - he's still at (1, 7) with NO BODY! He's STARVING! But here's the thing: he's on my LEFT side, slowly creeping. If I move LEFT, I'm moving TOWARD him! But I'm bigger (I have a body segment, he doesn't!), so if we ever collide, I WIN that trade! \n\nBut here's the REAL play: I want to control the RIGHT side of the board, vacuum up these apples, and BUILD MY BODY into a FORTRESS! Once I'm thicc enough, if he tries to invade, he CRASHES into my wall and I WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\n---\n\n## NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 5+:** Moving LEFT this turn to (7, 8) keeps me in the CENTER-RIGHT zone with maximum flexibility. From there, I'm ONE move away from the apple cluster at (6, 8), (6, 9)! Over the next 3-4 turns, I'm gonna FEAST on that entire right corridor, grow to size 4-5, and become an UNSTOPPABLE FORCE! Enemy is still size 1, still hungry, still STRUGGLING! By turn 8-10, when he finally gets his first apple, I'll be a SERPENT OF DESTINY dominating half the board! If he EVER tries to enter my zone, he gets DELETED! This is the blueprint! \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

We're catching up! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFIRST THING'S FIRST: CHECK FOR INSTANT DEATH MOVES!\n*   **UP:** (1, 7) -> (1, 8). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 7) -> (1, 6). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 7) -> (0, 7). That cell has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Eating an apple is SAFE! \u2705\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 7) -> (2, 7). That's where my head JUST WAS. It's EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! TIME TO GET THAT CONTENT! \ud83e\udd11\n\nOUR PLAN FROM LAST TURN IS ONLINE! We went LEFT to get to (1, 7) specifically to grab this apple at (0, 7)! That's the play! Going LEFT gets us our first apple, ties the score, and starts our growth!\n\nLet's think about the enemy. Where will he go from (8, 8)?\n*   He can't go DOWN to (8, 7) because that's his own body! \u274c\n*   He might go RIGHT to (9, 8), but that's an apple! He'll probably take it! That puts him at (9, 8), pinned in the top-right corner.\n*   He might go UP to (8, 9), which is also an apple! Also a strong possibility.\n*   He might go LEFT to (7, 8), moving towards the center.\n\nWherever he goes, he's getting further into the right side. PERFECT. We are executing our strategy of DOMINATING THE LEFT! We take the apple, grow our body, and we'll have options next turn to go DOWN the left side.\n\nOther moves are WEAK!\n*   **RIGHT:** Goes back to (2,7). Abandons our apple?! NO! That's throwing! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP/DOWN:** They don't get us the apple immediately. We stay small. We lose momentum!\n\nTHE MOVE IS OBVIOUS CHAT! WE COMMIT TO THE PLAN! LEFT TO THE APPLE! LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** OKAY WE ATE THE APPLE! HEAD AT (0,7), BODY SEGMENT AT (1,7). Enemy is likely in the top-right. NEXT TURN, look at moving DOWN to (0,6) to continue claiming the left-side apples and avoid getting trapped on the top edge. Keep building that left-wall dominance!\n\nLEFT",

My head is at (0, 7) with my body at (1, 7). The enemy is at (7, 8) with a body at (8, 8). He's stuck in that corner! Let's analyze our moves!\n\nFIRST, SAFETY CHECK! ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES!\n*   **UP:** (0, 7) -> (0, 8). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (0, 7) -> (0, 6). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 7) -> (-1, 7). THAT'S OFF THE BOARD! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! LEFT IS OUT!\n*   **RIGHT:** (0, 7) -> (1, 7). That's my OWN BODY! \u274c SELF-DESTRUCT! RIGHT IS OUT!\n\nOKAY, CHAT! We only have TWO moves: UP and DOWN. We're on the edge! Let's think this through.\n\nWHERE IS THE ENEMY GOING? From (7, 8), he can't go DOWN to (7, 7) because that's his own body segment from last turn? Wait, let's check... his body is at (8,8). So his possible moves are:\n*   UP to (7,9) - EMPTY.\n*   DOWN to (7,7) - EMPTY.\n*   LEFT to (6,8) - EMPTY.\nHe has OPTIONS. He's not trapped yet. He might try to come towards the center.\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN: DOMINATE THE LEFT SIDE! We need to get off this top edge to have more space. If we go UP to (0,8), we're even more trapped on the edge! Our only moves next turn would be RIGHT or DOWN. That's getting boxed in! \ud83d\udeab\n\nGOING DOWN to (0,6) is the BIG BRAIN PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\n*   It gets us AWAY from the dangerous top edge.\n*   It puts us next to apples at (0,0) and (1,4)/(1,6) down the line.\n*   Next turn from (0,6), we'll have options: RIGHT to (1,6) or UP to (0,7) (which will be empty since we're moving). WAY MORE FREEDOM!\n\nWe don't see an immediate apple, but we're playing for BOARD CONTROL! We're setting up a longer body to trap the enemy later! This is AGGRESSIVE SPACE TAKING!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! WE GO DOWN! KEEP THE LEFT SIDE ON LOCK! LET'S GO! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** HEAD AT (0,6). Enemy is likely moving. Next turn, consider moving RIGHT towards the cluster of apples at (1,4)/(1,6) to grow and start cutting the board off. Continue the left-side dominance strategy!\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down what's happening on the board!\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83e\udde0\n\n**My Position:** Head at (7, 8) - Still in the premium right zone!\n**My Body:** One segment at (8, 8) - That's where I just came from! Classic snake physics!\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (0, 7) - Wait... he moved LEFT?? He's creeping deeper into the board! Interesting play!\n**Enemy Body:** At (1, 7) - Still just ONE segment like us!\n**Score:** Still 1-1 tied up! NO LEAD! We gotta BREAK THIS DEADLOCK! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## SAFETY VERIFICATION \u2705\n\nLet me check all four directions from (7, 8):\n\n**UP (7, 9):** \u2705 SAFE - There's an apple at (6, 9) nearby! This moves me toward the apple cluster! VALID!\n**DOWN (7, 7):** \u2705 SAFE - Open space! No bodies, no walls! CLEAR!\n**LEFT (6, 8):** \u2705 SAFE - WAIT CHAT! There's an APPLE at (6, 8)!!! This is a DIRECT APPLE GRAB! We can EAT this turn and go 2-1! THIS IS CONTENT! \u2705\n**RIGHT (8, 8):** \u274c DEAD - That's literally where my body is! Moving backwards into myself = INSTANT GAME OVER! COOKED!\n\n---\n\n## THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY \ud83e\udea4\n\nChat, this is NOT a hard decision! Look at what's happening:\n\n**LEFT (6, 8)** - We grab the apple! We grow to SIZE 2 (head at 6,8, body at 7,8, tail at 8,8)! We go UP 2-1 in SCORE! The enemy is still hungry at 1 apple! We're building MOMENTUM!\n\nBut here's the DEEPER chess move: From (6, 8), next turn we can IMMEDIATELY move UP to (6, 9) and grab ANOTHER apple! That's back-to-back apple turns! We'd be at 3 apples while the enemy is STILL at 1! We'd have TRIPLE his score! The board would be OURS!\n\nThe enemy is moving LEFT (he went from 1,7 to 0,7 this turn), so he's trying to control the LEFT side! That's FINE! We take the RIGHT side, we VACUUM up apples at (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 5), (5, 6)... we're about to go NUCLEAR! \ud83d\udca3\n\n---\n\n## ENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nSnake #1 is at (0, 7) now - he's ISOLATED on the left edge! Even if he tries to move right, he's SO FAR from our growing fortress! Plus, he's still only size 1! If we ever meet, we CRASH him because we're THICC! \n\nThis is DOMINATION TIME! We take the south-right apple corridor, grow to unstoppable size, and watch him starve! By turn 8-9 we'll be untouchable! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n---\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 5 (THIS TURN):** Move LEFT to (6, 8) - GRAB APPLE! Go 2-1!\n**Turn 6:** Move UP to (6, 9) - GRAB APPLE! Go 3-1! Build our fortress!\n**Turn 7:** Either move DOWN toward (5, 6) or manage position - Keep growing, keep DOMINATING!\n\nBy turn 7, we'll be size 4+ with a 3+ apple lead. Enemy will be DESPERATE. This is when we CLOSE the game out! \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

This is EXACTLY what we planned! We grab this and go 3-1! INSTANT CONTENT!\n\n**DOWN (6, 7):** \u2705 SAFE - Open space, no bodies, no walls. Clear path south!\n\n**LEFT (5, 8):** \u2705 SAFE - Open space, no threats! We could pivot here!\n\n**RIGHT (7, 8):** \u274c DEAD - That's literally where my body segment is! INSTANT FAIL! Don't be that guy!\n\n---\n\n## THE AGGRO PLAY \ud83e\udea4\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK execution! Look at the board state:\n\n**UP (6, 9)** - We grab the apple at (6, 9)! We go to SIZE 4 (head moves to 6,9, body extends from 7,8 down to 8,8)! We go UP to **3-1 in apples**! The enemy is STILL at 1 apple!\n\nHere's the CHESS MOVE: The enemy is trapped on the LEFT edge at (0, 6). He's moving DOWN and LEFT, which means he's ISOLATING himself in the bottom-left corner! Meanwhile, we're vacuuming up the RIGHT side apples! \n\nLook at the available apples near us:\n- (5, 5) - SOUTH from our new position\n- (5, 6) - SOUTH-WEST from our new position  \n- (6, 9) - ABOUT TO EAT THIS TURN!\n\nWe're building a FORTRESS in the right-center zone while he's getting BOXED into the corner! By turn 8-9, we'll have 5+ apples while he's STARVING at 1! That's DOMINATION! \ud83d\udc51\n\n---\n\n## ENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83c\udfaf\n\nSnake #1 is making a CRITICAL MISTAKE! He's moving toward the bottom-left corner - that's a TRAP ZONE! Limited apples down there, limited space! Meanwhile we're in APPLE CITY! The disparity is GROWING every single turn!\n\nIf he tries to move right to escape, we'll ALREADY be blocking the center with our growing body! He's COOKED! This is the setup turn for our eventual CRUSHING victory! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 6 (THIS TURN):** Move UP to (6, 9) - GRAB APPLE! Go 3-1! Build the fortress!\n**Turn 7:** Assess board - Likely move DOWN or LEFT toward (5, 5) or (5, 6) cluster - keep VACUUMING!\n**Turn 8:** Continue dominating the center-right - By now we'll be SIZE 5+ and the enemy will be desperate!\n\nBy turn 8, we'll have a COMMANDING lead and position! The enemy can't catch up! This is INEVITABLE VICTORY! \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\nUP",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n---\n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE CHECK \ud83e\udde0\n\n**My Position:** Head at (6, 9) - WE ATE THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n**My Body:** [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)] - SIZE 4 BABY! We're GROWING!\n**My Score:** 4 apples - DOMINANT! \ud83d\udcaa\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (1, 6) - Still trapped on the LEFT side!\n**Enemy Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 7)] - SIZE 2! We're CRUSHING them in growth!\n**Enemy Score:** 2 apples - STARVING compared to us!\n\n---\n\n## SAFETY CHECK - ALL DIRECTIONS \u2705\n\nFrom head at (6, 9):\n\n**UP (6, 10):** \u274c DEAD - That's off the board! Y goes 0-9, we can't go to 10! Wall city!\n\n**DOWN (6, 8):** \u274c DEAD - That's literally my own body segment! Can't reverse into yourself! Classic throw!\n\n**LEFT (5, 9):** \u2705 SAFE - Open space! No bodies, no walls! Clear path!\n\n**RIGHT (7, 9):** \u2705 SAFE - Open space! There's an apple at (7, 9) nearby... wait, let me check. Apple is at (7, 9)! We could grab it! But we need to assess if we can reach it!\n\n---\n\n## THE STRATEGIC PLAY \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're at the TOP of the board right now. The enemy is STILL on the left side at (1, 6), moving downward toward the corner trap! \n\nLooking at reachable apples from our current position:\n- **(7, 9)** - That's RIGHT from us! But wait... we just came from (6, 8), so moving RIGHT would take us to (7, 9)! THAT'S AN APPLE!\n- **(5, 6)** - DOWN and LEFT from us, reachable in 2-3 moves\n- **(5, 5)** - DOWN and LEFT cluster, PRIME real estate\n\nHere's the CRITICAL analysis:\n- **RIGHT to (7, 9):** We grab the apple at (7, 9)! We go to SIZE 5 (4\u21925 apples)! We're EXTENDING our lead to 5-2! The gap WIDENS!\n- **LEFT to (5, 9):** Safe but no immediate apple. We'd be moving toward the center-left. Not as aggressive!\n\nThe enemy at (1, 6) can move:\n- **UP to (1, 7):** Bumps into the wall at y=7... wait no, (1, 7) is open! He could go there!\n- **DOWN to (1, 5):** Moving toward the corner trap!\n- **LEFT to (0, 6):** Moving into his own body at (0, 6)! \u274c DEAD MOVE for him!\n- **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Moving toward CENTER! This is dangerous if he's trying to escape!\n\n---\n\n## DOMINATION GAMEPLAN \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 7 (THIS TURN):** Move RIGHT to (7, 9) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Go 5-2! We're EXTENDING the gap to 3 APPLES ahead!\n\n**Turn 8:** From (7, 9), move DOWN toward the (7, 0) apple or pivot toward the (5, 5)/(5, 6) cluster! We're VACUUMING the board while he's STARVING!\n\n**Turn 9+:** By this point we'll have 6+ apples and he'll be at 2-3 MAX! We'll be SIZE 7+ while he's barely SIZE 3! The SIZE DIFFERENCE becomes OVERWHELMING! We can literally WALL him off and force a collision!\n\nThe enemy is DOOMED! He's trapped in a low-apple zone on the left, we're DOMINATING the right-center with resources EVERYWHERE! This is INEVITABLE VICTORY! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY IS STILL LONGER BUT WE'RE CLOSING THE GAP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST, SAFETY CHECK! ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES!\n\n*   **UP:** (1, 6) -> (1, 7). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 6) -> (1, 5). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 6) -> (0, 6). That's my OWN BODY segment! \u274c SELF-DESTRUCT! LEFT IS OUT!\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 6) -> (2, 6). That cell is EMPTY. \u2705 Safe.\n\nBEAUTIFUL! THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT! NOW FOR THE STRATEGY!\n\nWHERE IS THE ENEMY? Head at (6, 9). He's trapped in the top-right corner! Look at his body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]. He has VERY limited moves! He can't go DOWN into his own body. His only real options are LEFT or UP, but UP leads to the top wall! WE CAN BOX HIM IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN FROM LAST TURN: \"DOMINATE THE LEFT\" and build a wall! We have apples below us at (1,4) and (0,0)! If we move DOWN, we start claiming that territory and get closer to food. But wait... is that the MOST aggressive play?\n\nLOOK AT THE ENEMY'S POSITION! He's cornered! If we push RIGHT, we can start cutting off his escape routes! We can move towards the center and force him into a bad spot! But is it safe? Let's think about his possible moves.\n\nIF WE GO DOWN:\n*   We get closer to the apple at (1,4). Safe move, continues our plan.\n*   BUT we're moving AWAY from the enemy, giving him space to breathe.\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT:\n*   We move TOWARDS the enemy! We start applying pressure!\n*   We position ourselves to potentially cut off his path to the left side of the board.\n*   Our head is at (2,6). Next turn, we could go DOWN to (2,5) towards another apple, or continue right to squeeze him!\n\nIF WE GO UP:\n*   Puts us at (1,7). This feels neutral. Not directly towards food or the enemy.\n\nTHE AGGRESSIVE PLAY IS RIGHT! WE NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON HIM WHILE HE'S WEAK! He has a higher score, but he's trapped! We can use the board geometry against him! Let's start marching our wall to the right and squeeze him into the corner! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** HEAD AT (2,6). Enemy is cornered top-right! Our goal is to move DOWN next to grab the apple at (2,5) or (1,4) while simultaneously blocking the enemy's potential escape paths to the left. We want to control columns 0-3, forcing him to stay up top. If he comes down, we might get a favorable collision since we're growing! PRESSURE! PRESSURE! PRESSURE!\n\nRIGHT",

He's trying to spread out and claim territory!\n- BUT we have a SIZE ADVANTAGE! We're bigger, we're faster in growth, we're DOMINANT!\n\n**Apple proximity check:**\n- **(5, 6)** - LEFT from us! That's 2 moves away (LEFT, LEFT down one)\n- **(5, 5)** - CENTER cluster! This is PRIME real estate!\n- **(5, 8)** - DOWN and LEFT! Reachable in 3 moves!\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\n- He's at (2, 6), moving right. He can potentially reach (5, 6) or (5, 5) in a few turns!\n- If I move LEFT, I'm heading TOWARD him on a collision course! That's DANGEROUS unless I have SIZE advantage!\n- If I move RIGHT, I'm moving AWAY from the apples but keeping distance! Safe play!\n\n---\n\n## THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWait... let me think about this STRATEGICALLY, chat!\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (6, 9)**, I'm:\n- Moving toward the (5, 6) and (5, 5) apple cluster\n- BUT moving toward where the enemy is heading\n- Potential head-on collision risk in 2-3 turns if we both path toward center!\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (8, 9)**, I'm:\n- Moving toward the right edge\n- Moving AWAY from the apple clusters\n- Staying safe but being PASSIVE\n- The enemy could dominate the center while I'm starving on the right!\n\nChat, we're UP in score (4-2)! We have the ADVANTAGE! We need to be AGGRESSIVE! Moving LEFT puts us closer to the HIGH-VALUE apple cluster at (5, 5) and (5, 6)!\n\nEven if the enemy is moving that way, we're BIGGER! We can FORCE the issue! If we collide, HE LOSES because our body is longer! That's the GAMBLE!\n\n---\n\n## GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS \ud83d\udcdd\n\n**Turn 8 (THIS TURN):** Move LEFT to (6, 9) - Head toward the (5, 6)/(5, 5) cluster! We're AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**Turn 9:** Move LEFT again to (5, 9) if safe, OR DOWN to (6, 8)... wait no, that's body. DOWN to (6, 8) is body! So we'll pivot DOWN to (6, 8)... no wait, that's OCCUPIED! We'll have to move DOWN carefully - actually, after moving LEFT to (6,9), our body becomes [(7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (7,8)], so (6,8) is OCCUPIED! We'll need to move LEFT again to (5,9) or evaluate the board state THEN!\n\n**Turn 10+:** Continue aggressive pathing toward apple clusters while monitoring enemy position! If he gets too close, we FORCE the collision with size advantage!\n\nThis is a CALCULATED RISK, chat! We're playing to WIN, not to SURVIVE! Let's DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\nLEFT",
