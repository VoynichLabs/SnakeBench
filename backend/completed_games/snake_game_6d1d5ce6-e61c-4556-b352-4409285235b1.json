          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! WE LIVE! Let's break down this board. My snake (ID 1) is at (6,7), and the opponent (ID 0) is at (7,6). We're head-to-head diagonally. Apples are scattered, but the real game is head-hunting.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** (6,7). I have body at none (just started, obviously).\n- **Enemy Position:** (7,6).\n- **Board Context:** It's a 10x10 grid. There's an apple at (7,8) directly above the enemy head, and (8,8) nearby. There's also an apple at (8,3) and (4,8), but proximity to the enemy is key. I need to control space.\n\n**MOVES CONSIDERED:**\n1. **UP to (6,8):** Safe? Yes, cell is empty (based on board state: row 8 has `.` at (6,8)). This moves me up towards the top-right quadrant. However, the enemy is at (7,6). If I go UP, I'm at (6,8). The enemy could go RIGHT to (8,6), UP to (7,7), or LEFT to (6,6). If he goes UP to (7,7), we are adjacent (6,8) vs (7,7) - diagonal, safe. If he goes LEFT to (6,6), we are far. If he goes RIGHT to (8,6), we are far. This keeps me alive.\n2. **DOWN to (6,6):** Safe? Yes. Moves me towards (6,5). But (6,5) is empty. This brings me closer to the enemy's potential moves. If enemy goes UP to (7,7), we are (6,6) vs (7,7) - diagonal, safe. If enemy goes LEFT to (6,6) (impossible, I'm moving there), he dies? No, he moves into my new body. Wait, simultaneous move. If I move DOWN to (6,6) and he moves LEFT to (6,6), we both die (head-on collision). That's bad if I don't have a higher score (score is 0-0). I want to avoid ties/death if possible.\n3. **LEFT to (5,7):** Safe? Yes. Moves to (5,7). This is away from the enemy at (7,6). Leaves options open.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,7):** **CRITICAL.** The enemy is at (7,6). If I go RIGHT to (7,7), I am moving into the cell *above* him. If he goes UP to (7,7), we collide head-on (both die). If he goes RIGHT to (8,6), we are safe. If he goes LEFT to (6,6), we are safe. If he goes DOWN to (7,5), safe.\n   - **Risk Assessment:** If I go RIGHT to (7,7) and he goes UP to (7,7), it's a draw (both 0 apples). We both die. That's not a win.\n   - **Reward:** If I go RIGHT to (7,7) and he goes ANYWHERE else (RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN), I am at (7,7) and he is at (7,6), (8,6), or (6,6). I am essentially cutting off his upward movement into the top-right corner. I gain position.\n   - **The Trap:** I want to box him in. By going RIGHT to (7,7), I occupy the space immediately above him. This forces him to react. If he goes UP, he dies (assuming I have higher score or it's a tie, which is bad, but at 0-0 it's a wash). If he goes RIGHT, he's at (8,6). If he goes LEFT, he's at (6,6). If he goes DOWN, he's at (7,5).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at (6,7). Enemy is at (7,6).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (7,7):\n- I am at (7,7).\n- Enemy is at (7,6).\n- If enemy goes **UP** to (7,7): Collision. 0-0 score -> Draw/Die. Not ideal.\n- If enemy goes **DOWN** to (7,5): Safe.\n- If enemy goes **LEFT** to (6,6): Safe.\n- If enemy goes **RIGHT** to (8,6): Safe.\n\nWait, looking at the board: There is an apple at (7,8) right above the enemy. If I don't go RIGHT, the enemy might snatch it. If I go RIGHT to (7,7), I block his access to (7,8) unless he goes through me (which kills him).\nHowever, there is a higher risk here. If I go RIGHT and he goes UP, we die. At 0-0 score, that's a draw. I want to WIN.\nBut if I go UP to (6,8), I miss the apple at (7,8) but I am safe. The enemy might take (7,8).\nIf I go DOWN to (6,6), I move away from the top-right apple cluster ((7,8), (8,8)).\nIf I go LEFT to (5,7), I move away.\n\nLet's reconsider the collision. If I go RIGHT to (7,7) and he goes UP to (7,7), we both die. The rules say: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"\nWe both have 0 apples. It's a draw. I want to win.\n\nIs there a move that guarantees survival AND pressure?\n**UP to (6,8):**\n- I move to (6,8).\n- Enemy moves. If he goes UP to (7,7), we are diagonal (safe). He can't get to (7,8) this turn.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (8,6), safe.\n- If he goes LEFT to (6,6), safe.\n- If he goes DOWN to (7,5), safe.\n- This move keeps me alive, keeps me near the (7,8) and (8,8) apples, and doesn't force a suicide collision.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" My score is 0. His is 0. I should NOT force a head-on collision. I need to survive to eat apples and grow first.\nSo, moving into the cell directly above the enemy (RIGHT to 7,7) is bad because it invites a trade where I don't have the advantage (score wise).\n\n**Revised Plan:**\nI need to approach the apple cluster at (7,8)/(8,8) without risking a trade at 0-0.\nThe enemy is at (7,6). The apple is at (7,8).\nIf I go **UP** to (6,8):\n- I am at (6,8).\n- The enemy cannot reach (6,8) this turn (he's at (7,6)).\n- If the enemy goes UP (to 7,7), I am safe at (6,8). Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat the apple.\n- If the enemy goes RIGHT (to 8,6), I am safe.\n- If the enemy goes LEFT (to 6,6), I am safe.\n\nThis seems the safest route to contest the apple at (7,8) next turn. Moving UP positions me to grab that apple while keeping a safe distance from the immediate head-on collision zone.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 8: ` . . . . A . . A A . `\n(7,8) is an Apple.\n(8,8) is an Apple.\nI am at (6,7).\nIf I go UP to (6,8), I am next to (7,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,7), I am below (7,8).\n\nIf I go UP to (6,8), and the enemy goes UP to (7,7):\n- Me: (6,8)\n- Enemy: (7,7)\n- Distance: 1 cell diagonal.\n- Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat the apple.\n- Enemy can go UP to (7,8) (collision if I am there) or RIGHT to (8,7) or LEFT to (6,7).\n- By going UP now, I claim the spot adjacent to the apple.\n\nLet's double check the \"UP\" move safety.\n(6,8) is empty on the board display.\nBoard:\n9 . A . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . A . . A A .  <- (6,8) is `.` (Row 8 index is y=8)\n7 . . . . . . 1 . . .\n...\nSo (6,8) is empty. Valid move.\n\nWhat about (5,7)? Left.\n(5,7) is empty.\nIf I go LEFT, I move away from the apple at (7,8). The enemy is at (7,6). If I go LEFT, the enemy can easily take (7,8) or (8,8). I lose map control.\n\nWhat about (6,6)? Down.\n(6,6) is empty.\nThis moves me towards the center but away from the apple. Enemy is at (7,6). If I go DOWN to (6,6) and enemy goes UP to (7,7), I'm safe. If enemy goes LEFT to (6,6), we trade heads (0-0 draw). Risky.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **UP** to (6,8).\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety:** (6,8) is empty. No immediate death.\n2.  **Positioning:** It puts me right next to the apple at (7,8).\n3.  **Aggression without Suicide:** Unlike moving RIGHT to (7,7) (which risks a trade with enemy moving UP), moving UP to (6,8) positions me to take the apple *next* turn while maintaining a safe buffer.\n4.  **Future Options:** From (6,8), I can go RIGHT (eat apple), UP (to 9), LEFT (to 5,8), or DOWN (back to 6,7). I keep options open.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGet to (6,8) to threaten the apple at (7,8). Next turn, if the enemy isn't blocking, eat the apple at (7,8) to grow. Use the size advantage to cut off the enemy's movement in the top-right corner. Do not trade heads at 0-0.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP (6,8):** Safe, contests apple next turn. WINNING.\n- **RIGHT (7,7):** High risk of trade/death at 0-0 score. LOSING.\n- **LEFT (5,7):** Passive, gives up map control. LOSING.\n- **DOWN (6,6):** Passive, risks trade if enemy moves LEFT. Meh.\n\nFinal check: The prompt says \"Force head-on collision if higher score\". Score is 0-0. Avoid collision.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nUP",

Dangerous because the opponent could dash RIGHT into the same square \u2192 head\u2011on KO.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,6). Same problem: the opponent might move DOWN into (6,6) \u2192 another head\u2011on.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,5). Safe for now, but it drifts away from the juicy apple column at x=8.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,6). Completely safe this turn, and it puts me right in the thick of the apple corridor (we\u2019ve got apples at (8,8), (8,4), (8,3) waiting).

We're at (6,8) now (we moved UP on the previous turn, good job!), and the enemy is at (8,6). The apple at (7,8) is staring us right in the face! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Current Position:** (6,8). Empty body.\n*   **Enemy Position:** (8,6).\n*   **Target:** (7,8). It's one step to the RIGHT.\n*   **The Trap:** I want to eat that apple, but I need to be careful. If I go RIGHT to (7,8), I eat the apple and grow. But where is the enemy?\n    *   Enemy is at (8,6). They can move LEFT to (7,6), UP to (8,7), or DOWN to (8,5).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (7,8), and enemy goes UP to (8,7), we are diagonal and safe.\n    *   **However**, looking at the board, there is another apple at (8,8). If the enemy sees that apple, they might go UP to (8,7) to set up for (8,8).\n    *   **CRITICAL MISTAKE CHECK:** If I go UP to (6,9) or RIGHT to (7,8), I might be moving towards the enemy's path. But wait, looking at the board...\n    *   **Board State Check:** Row 8 has apples at (7,8) and (8,8). Row 9 has an apple at (1,9).\n    *   **Enemy Intent:** The enemy is at (8,6). The most valuable space is the top right corner (7,8) and (8,8).\n    *   **The Kill Move:** If I go RIGHT to (7,8), I eat the apple.\n    *   **Is there a head-on collision risk?**\n        *   Enemy at (8,6). I am at (6,8).\n        *   Enemy cannot reach (7,8) in one move from (8,6). They would need to go LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT. Neither works in one turn.\n        *   Enemy CAN reach (8,7) by going UP.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (7,8) and Enemy goes UP to (8,7), I am safe.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (7,8) and Enemy goes UP to (8,7), next turn I can potentially go UP to (7,9) or RIGHT to (8,8).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to secure that apple at (7,8) immediately. It's free growth and it blocks the enemy from getting it.\nFrom (6,8), moving **RIGHT** to (7,8) is the optimal play.\n1.  It eats the apple (Growth +1).\n2.  It denies the enemy that specific apple.\n3.  It positions me to contest the apple at (8,8) next turn.\n4.  It keeps me safe from immediate collision (enemy is too far away to reach my destination).\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **RIGHT (7,8):** Eats apple. Safe. Winning.\n*   **UP (6,9):** Moves to edge. No apple. Wastes turn. Losing.\n*   **LEFT (5,8):** Moves away from apples. Wastes turn. Losing.\n*   **DOWN (6,7):** Moves away from apples. Wastes turn. Losing.\n\nIt's simple. I take the food, I grow, I dominate the board. The enemy is in the lower right, I'm taking the upper right.\n\nLet's get this apple! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Apples: 0.  \n**Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (8, 7). Body: none. Apples: 0.  \n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nMy head is at (6, 9). Looking at the board state provided:\n```\n 9 . A . . . . 1 . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . 0 .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 A . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . A .\n 3 . . . . . A . . A .\n 2 . A . . A . . . . .\n 1 . . A . A . A . . A\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n**Wait, there's a discrepancy.**\n- The `BOARD STATE` shows my head `1` at `(6, 9)`.\n- The `YOUR SNAKE` description says: `Head: (6, 9)`.\n- The `YOUR LAST MOVE` section says: \"We're at (6,8) now (we moved UP on the previous turn...)\"\n- The `APPLE DROPS` list includes `(7, 8)` and `(8, 8)`.\n- **Visual Inspection of Board State:** Row 9 (y=9) shows `1` at x=6. Row 8 (y=8) shows `A` (Apple) at x=7 and x=8. Row 7 (y=7) shows `0` (Enemy) at x=8.\n\n**CRITICAL CORRECTION:**\nThe provided `BOARD STATE` is visually accurate for the coordinates.\n- My Head: (6, 9)\n- Enemy Head: (8, 7)\n- Apples: (7, 8) and (8, 8) are visible on Row 8.\n\nHowever, the `YOUR LAST MOVE` text states I am at `(6, 8)`. If I moved UP from `(6, 8)` to `(6, 9)`, that matches the current Board State and Head coordinates. The `BOARD STATE` confirms I am at `(6, 9)`.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **My Position:** (6, 9). Top edge of the board.\n- **Enemy Position:** (8, 7).\n- **Apple at (7, 8):** This is the prime target. It is one step DOWN and RIGHT from my current position.\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1.  **UP:** (6, 9) -> (6, 10). **DEAD.** Off the board. (Coordinates 0-9 only). **ELIMINATED.**\n2.  **DOWN:** (6, 9) -> (6, 8).\n    - Cell (6, 8) is currently empty (Visual check of board row 8: `. . . . . . . A A .` - x=6 is empty).\n    - This move heads toward the apple at (7, 8) and (8, 8).\n    - Enemy at (8, 7) can move UP to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 7).\n    - If I go DOWN to (6, 8) and Enemy goes UP to (8, 8), we are safe.\n    - If I go DOWN to (6, 8) and Enemy goes LEFT to (7, 7), we are safe.\n    - **Risk:** Enemy could potentially move UP-LEFT (if diagonal allowed, but standard snake rules imply cardinal only). Assuming cardinal moves, Enemy cannot hit me from (8, 7) if I am at (6, 8).\n3.  **LEFT:** (6, 9) -> (5, 9).\n    - Cell (5, 9) is empty (Visual check of row 9: `. A . . . 1 . . .` -> Wait, looking at the board representation:\n      Row 9: `9 . A . . . . 1 . . .` -> Indices: 0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: 1, 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\n      Wait, looking closely at the ASCII art provided:\n      `9 . A . . . . 1 . . .`\n      Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n      Index 6 is `1`. Index 5 is `.`. Index 4 is `.`.\n      So (5, 9) is empty.\n    - This moves away from the apple cluster at (7,8)/(8,8).\n4.  **RIGHT:** (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\n    - Cell (7, 9) is empty (Visual check of row 9, index 7 is `.`).\n    - This moves closer to the apple at (7, 8) and (8, 8).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n- **Goal:** Control the board, eat apples, trap the enemy.\n- **Current Opportunity:** The apple at (7, 8) is highly contested. The enemy is at (8, 7). From (8, 7), the enemy can reach (7, 8) in one move (LEFT). If I am at (6, 9), I can reach (7, 8) in one move (DOWN-RIGHT? No, cardinal only). I can reach (6, 8) in one move (DOWN).\n- **If I go DOWN to (6, 8):**\n  - Next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 8) to eat the apple.\n  - However, if the enemy goes LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8), I am safe this turn.\n  - **CRITICAL:** If I go DOWN to (6, 8), and the Enemy goes UP to (8, 8), I can eat (7, 8) next turn.\n  - **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n    - My potential move: DOWN to (6, 8).\n    - Enemy potential move: LEFT to (7, 7). Distance from (6, 8) to (7, 7) is diagonal. Safe.\n    - Enemy potential move: UP to (8, 8). Distance from (6, 8) to (8, 8) is 2 squares away. Safe.\n- **Why not RIGHT to (7, 9)?**\n  - (7, 9) is safer long-term (more space to the right towards 9,9), but (6, 8) is closer to the immediate apple at (7, 8).\n  - If I go RIGHT to (7, 9), I am at the top edge. My only moves next turn would be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (to 8,9).\n  - If I go DOWN to (6, 8), I open up LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, and can challenge the apple immediately.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to move towards the apple at (7, 8).\nFrom (6, 9), **DOWN** to (6, 8) is the move.\n- It avoids the wall (UP is death).\n- It positions me to eat the apple at (7, 8) next turn.\n- It is safer than moving LEFT (away from resources).\n- It is safer than moving RIGHT (putting my back to the wall at (7,9) or (8,9), limiting future options compared to being at (6,8)).\n\n**Safety Check for DOWN (6, 8):**\n- Is (6, 8) occupied? Board shows empty.\n- Is (6, 8) an apple? No.\n- Is the enemy moving into (6, 8)? Enemy is at (8, 7). To hit (6, 8), enemy would need to move 2 squares LEFT and 1 UP, which is impossible in one turn (only cardinal moves).\n- Is the enemy moving into my path such that I hit him next turn? I will be at (6, 8). Enemy at (8, 7) or (7, 7) or (8, 8). None of these are (7, 8) which is my target for next turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 8). Prepare to eat the apple at (7, 8) on Turn 3. Watch the enemy's position to ensure I don't get blocked.\n\nYO CHAT, LET'S SECURE THE FOOD! We're going DOWN to set up the apple capture!\n\nDOWN",

I'm at **(6, 8)** now after moving DOWN last turn (good call, chat!). The enemy is at **(8, 8)**, right next to me! He must have moved UP from (8, 7) to grab that apple.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** (6, 8) - Head.\n*   **Enemy Position:** (8, 8) - Head.\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(8, 7)] - He grew by 1, so his body is now at his previous spot.\n*   **Apples Nearby:** (7, 8) is gone (enemy ate it). (8, 4), (5, 3), (4, 1), (6, 1), (9, 1), (4, 8) are on the board. (4, 8) is close! (5, 3) is also reachable.\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION (From (6, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP:** Back to (6, 9). Safe, but puts me back near the wall.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (6, 7). Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT:** To (5, 8). Empty. Safe. Moves toward (4, 8) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (7, 8). **DANGER ZONE.** Why?\n    *   Enemy is at (8, 8).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 8), and Enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8), we crash heads. **BOTH DIE.**\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 8), and Enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7) (his own body), **HE DIES.**\n    *   *Wait*, if Enemy moves DOWN into his own body, he dies. If I move into that cell? I think the collision happens simultaneously. If he moves into his own body, he dies regardless of me. If I move into a cell he occupied at the start of the turn (8,7), I die. But (8,7) is his tail. If he moves DOWN, (8,7) becomes empty (unless he grows). If he doesn't grow, (8,7) is free.\n    *   However, the biggest risk is the Head-on collision at (7,8). I have 0 apples, he has 1. **HE HAS HIGHER SCORE.** If we trade heads, **I LOSE** because he wins the tie-breaker (more apples).\n    *   Therefore, **I CANNOT CHALLENGE HIM HEAD-ON.** I must avoid (7, 8) this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to avoid the enemy and secure food. (4, 8) is a juicy apple at x=4, y=8.\nTo get to (4, 8), I need to go **LEFT**.\nFrom (6, 8) -> **LEFT** to (5, 8).\nFrom (5, 8) -> **LEFT** to (4, 8) (Apple!).\n\nIs (5, 8) safe?\n*   Enemy is at (8, 8). He can move DOWN, LEFT, or UP. He can't reach (5, 8) in one turn.\n*   (5, 8) is empty.\n\nIs there a better move?\n*   **DOWN to (6, 7)** opens up (6, 6) and (5, 6) but (4, 8) is right there to the left.\n*   **UP to (6, 9)** is safe but limits movement (wall).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 8)** gives me a direct path to an apple and moves me away from the enemy at (8, 8).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (5, 8). This positions me to eat the apple at (4, 8) next turn, away from the enemy's immediate vicinity. It avoids the deadly head-on collision risk at (7, 8).\n\nYO CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE FOOD ON THE LEFT! WE AVOIDING THE ENEMY SINCE HE HAS MORE APPLES! LET'S GET THIS BREAD!\n\nLEFT",

I just ate an apple and grew to length 2. Score is 1-2. I'm behind.\n\nLet's look at the board. I'm at (4,8). Apple at (1,9) is way up, but (0,0) is bottom-left. There's an apple at (1,2) and (0,5). I need to be aggressive. The enemy is moving from (6,8). If he moves left to (5,8), he'll crash into my body (since I'm at (4,8) and my body is at (5,8)). Wait, no. If he moves to (5,8), that's my body cell. That would kill him instantly. That would be a win for me! But I can't count on that. I have to assume he's not suicidal. He's at (6,8). He might move UP to (6,9) (wall), LEFT to (5,8) (my body, death), RIGHT to (7,8) (his body, death), or DOWN to (6,7). He'll likely go DOWN to (6,7) to stay alive and look for apples. If he goes down, we are safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3,8), I'm moving further left. Good. Opens up options for (2,8) and (1,8).\nIf I move DOWN to (4,7), I go down into the open space.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,8), I move back onto my own body. That's death. Can't do that.\nIf I move UP to (4,9), that's a wall.\n\nSo LEFT and DOWN are safe. RIGHT is death. UP is death.\n\nMy plan: I want to dominate the left side. The enemy is on the right. If I go LEFT, I secure the left flank. If I go DOWN, I go central. The apple at (1,2) is down-left. The apple at (0,5) is left-down.\n\nLet's check coordinates. My body is at (5,8). If I go LEFT to (3,8), I'm safe. If I go DOWN to (4,7), I'm safe.\nHowever, I need to think about the enemy. He is at (6,8). He sees me at (4,8). If he moves down to (6,7), he's safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am opening up the top row for him? No, he's at the bottom of the top row (y=8).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving closer to the apple at (1,2). But I need to watch out for the enemy potentially cutting me off.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,8). He is 2 cells away from me horizontally.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am 3 cells away.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I am at (4,7). He is at (6,8). Distance is roughly sqrt(5). He is not close to me.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state provided in the prompt, there is an apple at (1,8). Wait, looking at the board state visualization:\n9 . A . . . . . . . .\n8 . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\n\nThere is an 'A' at (1,8)? No, looking at the text:\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . A . . . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\n\nWait, the coordinates are (x, y). (0,0) is bottom left.\nRow 9 (y=9): . A . . . . . . . .\nRow 8 (y=8): . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\n\nSo at (1,8) there is an 'A'. An apple! It's right there! I'm at (4,8). The apple is at (1,8). I can walk left and eat it!\nLeft to (3,8) -> Empty.\nLeft to (2,8) -> Empty.\nLeft to (1,8) -> Apple!\n\nI am currently at (4,8).\nMove LEFT to (3,8). This moves me closer to the apple at (1,8).\nIs (3,8) safe? Yes.\nIs (2,8) safe? Yes.\nIs (1,8) safe? Yes, currently.\n\nEnemy is at (6,8).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), he hits my body (since my body is at (5,8)). He dies.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), I am at (3,8). He dies. I win.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (6,7), he lives.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (7,8), he hits his own body (7,8 is his body? No, his body is (7,8) and (8,8). Wait, his head is (6,8). His body is (7,8), (8,8). If he moves RIGHT to (7,8), he hits his own body. Death.\nIf he moves UP to (6,9), wall.\n\nSo if he moves LEFT, he dies. If he moves RIGHT, he dies. If he moves UP, he dies.\nHis only survival move is DOWN to (6,7).\nIf he goes DOWN, I go LEFT to (3,8).\n\nThis puts me at (3,8) and him at (6,7).\nI am closer to the apple at (1,8).\nI am safe.\nMy body will be at (4,8).\nI am claiming the left side.\n\nIs there any other move?\nDOWN to (4,7).\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I am safe.\nBut the apple at (1,8) is on the row y=8.\nIf I go DOWN, I leave that apple for the enemy if he decides to go LEFT (but he dies if he goes left into my body).\nActually, if he goes DOWN to (6,7), he can potentially loop around to (1,8) later.\nBut I am closer to (1,8) right now.\nDistance from me (4,8) to (1,8) is 3 steps.\nDistance from him (6,8) to (1,8) is 5 steps.\nIf I go LEFT, I am 2 steps away.\nIf I go DOWN, I am 3 steps away from (4,7), and then I have to loop back up. That takes time.\n\nMy score is 1. His is 2. I need that apple.\nI must go LEFT.\nIf I go LEFT, I am forcing him to go DOWN.\nIf he goes DOWN, I am safe.\nIf he goes LEFT (suicide), I win immediately.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 8: . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy head (4,8) is '1'.\nMy tail (5,8) is 'T'.\nEnemy head (6,8) is '0'.\nEnemy body (7,8) is 'T'.\nEnemy body (8,8) is 'T'.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am safe.\nIf he goes LEFT to (5,8), he hits my tail. He dies.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7,8), he hits his own body. He dies.\nIf he goes UP to (6,9), wall. He dies.\nIf he goes DOWN to (6,7), he lives.\n\nI am betting on him going DOWN.\nEven if he goes DOWN, I am at (3,8) with an apple at (1,8) waiting for me.\nI am growing. I am dominating the space.\n\nWhat about DOWN?\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I leave the apple at (1,8) open.\nBut wait, is there an apple at (1,8)? The board state shows \" . A \". Yes.\nIs there an apple at (4,7)? No. It's empty.\nSo LEFT is the move to get the apple.\n\nI must be careful about my body.\nMy body is at (5,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), my body moves to (4,8).\nNext turn, I can go LEFT to (2,8).\nThen LEFT to (1,8) to eat the apple.\nThat is a clear path.\n\nWhat if the enemy is tricky?\nHe is at (6,8). He is trapped if he doesn't move down.\nHe has to move down.\n\nLet's double check the board state for other apples on row 8.\nRow 8: . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\nApple at (1,8).\nNo other apples on this row.\nI am going to eat it.\n\nIs there any danger in moving LEFT?\n(3,8) is empty.\n(2,8) is empty.\n(1,8) is apple.\n(0,8) is wall? No, (0,8) is wall edge.\nI am good.\n\nOne detail: The enemy has 2 apples. I have 1.\nIf I eat this apple, I will have 2. Score tied.\nMy length will be 3 (Head (3,8), Body (4,8), Tail (5,8)).\nEnemy length is 3 (Head (6,8), Body (7,8), Tail (8,8)).\nLengths will be tied.\nPositionally, I will be at x=3, he will be at x=6 (assuming he goes down to y=7).\nI am on the left. He is on the right.\nThe board has apples scattered.\nApple at (1,2) is near me.\nApple at (0,5) is near me.\nApple at (0,0) is near me.\nI control the left side.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I am in the middle.\nApple at (4,2) is below me.\nBut apple at (1,8) is left.\nApple at (1,8) is closer right now.\n\nStrategy:\nGo LEFT.\nClaim the apple.\nDominate the left flank.\nTrap him on the right or force him to cross into my body later.\n\nLast turn I went LEFT to get to (4,8) to eat the apple at (4,8)? No, wait.\nLast turn rationale said: \"LEFT to (4,8): APPLE!\"\nBut my head is currently at (4,8).\nSo I must have moved LEFT from (5,8) to (4,8) in Turn 4.\nWait, the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says LEFT.\nSo I moved from (5,8) to (4,8).\nThat means I just ate the apple at (4,8).\nBut the board state shows:\nRow 8: . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\nWait. The board state shows '1' at index 4 (x=4). That's my head.\nIt shows 'A' at index 1 (x=1).\nIt shows '.' at index 4 in previous turns? No.\nLet's look at the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 5.\n9 . A . . . . . . . .\n8 . A . . 1 T 0 T T .\n\nThere is NO apple at (4,8) in the current board state.\nThe apple at (4,8) was eaten.\nThe apples listed in \"APPLE DROPS\" are historical or available? No, the board state is the current truth.\nThe board state shows an 'A' at (1,8).\nSo the apple at (4,8) is gone. I ate it last turn.\nMy score is 1. I ate one apple.\nThe apple at (4,8) was the one I ate.\nSo now I am at (4,8).\nThere is an apple at (1,8).\nI should go get it.\n\nIs there any apple closer?\n(4,2) is below.\nDistance from (4,8) to (4,2) is 6 steps.\nDistance from (4,8) to (1,8) is 3 steps.\n(1,8) is much closer.\nAlso, (1,8) is on the same row. Faster to get.\n\nWhat if the enemy sees the apple at (1,8) and tries to get it?\nHe is at (6,8).\nDistance to (1,8) is 5 steps.\nI am 3 steps away.\nI will get there first.\nIf he tries to go left, he dies on my body (at 5,8 or 4,8).\nSo he can't go left on this turn.\nHe must go down.\nIf he goes down, he is further away.\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\nFinal check for death conditions:\n1. Wall? No, (3,8) is inside.\n2. Own body? My body is (5,8). (3,8) is empty. (4,8) is my head currently, will become body. (3,8) is not (5,8). Safe.\n3. Enemy body? Enemy body is (7,8), (8,8). (3,8) is clear.\n4. Enemy head? Enemy is at (6,8). He moves simultaneously. He moves to (6,7). (3,8) is nowhere near (6,7). Safe.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nI will type out the rationale and then the moveYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 5 and we are ROLLING! We just secured an apple last turn and we are hungry for more! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Position:** (4, 8) - Head. Body: [(5, 8)].\n- **Enemy Position:** (6, 8) - Head. Body: [(7, 8), (8, 8)].\n- **Score:** Me 1, Enemy 2. **I NEED TO CATCH UP!**\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION (From (4, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** Wall. Dead. \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** Empty. Safe, but I'm moving away from the prize!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** **APPLE ALERT!** \ud83c\udf4e\n    - There is an apple at **(1, 8)**. I am at (4, 8). That is only 3 steps away!\n    - Enemy is at (6, 8). He is 5 steps away.\n    - **CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:** If I go LEFT to (3, 8), I am safe.\n        - My body is at (5, 8). I'm not hitting myself.\n        - Enemy body is at (7, 8) and (8, 8). I'm not hitting him.\n    - **ENEMY PREDICTION:** He is trapped. If he goes LEFT to (5, 8), he hits my body and DIES. If he goes RIGHT to (7, 8), he hits his own body and DIES. If he goes UP, he hits the wall. **His ONLY survival move is DOWN to (6, 7).**\n    - If he goes DOWN, he is out of my way. I am clear to march to the apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** **DEATH.** That is my own body. Do not throw! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nChat, look at that board! There is an apple at **(1, 8)** sitting there waiting for us. It's on the same row, to the left. I am closer than the enemy, and if I move left, I force him down into the abyss while I secure the point.\nI am currently dominating the left side of the map. If I secure this apple, I tie the score 2-2 and extend my body length to 3. I will control the entire top-left quadrant while he scrambles on the right.\nDo not settle for the middle. Chase the points. Chase the win.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGrab the apple at **LEFT**. Tie the score. Dominate the flank!\n\nLETS GOOOO!\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Turn 6, let's break this down.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 8) \u2014 Wait, looking at the \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" section, it says I picked **LEFT**. That means I moved from (4, 8) to (3, 8).\n- **My Body:** [(4, 8)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 7) \u2014 The replay says the enemy moved DOWN to (6, 7), which was their only survival move. Smart of them to avoid suicide.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 8), (7, 8)] \u2014 Wait, the board state in the prompt says the enemy is at (6, 7), body at (6, 8) and (7, 8)? No, the prompt says: \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8)]\".\n  - *Correction:* The prompt says \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8)]\". Wait, that is weird. The body should be the previous positions.\n  - Let's look at the board state visualization provided in the prompt at the top:\n    `8 . A . . 1 T 0 T T .`\n    This visual is from the *start* of the turn (Turn 5 visual).\n    But the *text* description for Turn 6 says:\n    \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8)]\"\n    This implies the enemy moved DOWN to (6, 7) and their tail is (7, 8)? No, usually body is a list from head to tail? Wait, the prompt says: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\n    So for Snake #0:\n    - Head: (6, 7)\n    - Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8)]\n    This means the snake is:\n    - Head at (6, 7)\n    - Neck at (6, 8)\n    - Tail at (7, 8)\n    This confirms the enemy moved DOWN.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MY MOVE (CURRENTLY AT 3,8):**\nI am at (3, 8). My body is at (4, 8).\nThere is an apple at (1, 8).\nThere is an apple at (2, 1). (Wait, is (2, 1) reachable? It's far down).\nThere is an apple at (1, 9). (Up top).\nThere is an apple at (0, 5). (Left/Down).\n\n**MOVES FROM (3, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** Wall. Dead. \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Empty? Let's check the board.\n    Row 7: `7 . . . . . . 0 . . .`\n    Wait, the board state visualization is old. The enemy is now at (6, 7).\n    So (3, 7) is currently empty.\n    Is it safe? Yes.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** Empty?\n    Row 8 visual: `. A . . 1 T 0 T T .`\n    Current Head (3, 8). Left (2, 8) is empty.\n    Is it safe? Yes.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** **DEATH.**\n    That is my body. I just moved from there. If I turn around, I hit myself. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DECISION MAKING:**\nI need to eat apples. I am currently at (3, 8).\n- **Target Apple 1:** (1, 8). Distance: 2 moves (Left, Left).\n- **Target Apple 2:** (0, 5). Distance: 3 moves Left + 3 moves Down = 6 moves (roughly).\n- **Target Apple 3:** (2, 1). Distance: 1 Left + 7 Down = 8 moves.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\nWhere is the enemy?\nEnemy Head: (6, 7).\nEnemy Body: (6, 8), (7, 8).\nMy Head: (3, 8).\nMy Body: (4, 8).\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (2, 8)**:\n- I am moving toward the apple at (1, 8).\n- My new head: (2, 8).\n- My new body: [(3, 8), (4, 8)].\n- Enemy moves simultaneously.\n- Where can the enemy go?\n  - Enemy is at (6, 7).\n  - He can go UP to (6, 8). **DANGER:** (6, 8) is currently his body (neck). Wait, his body is [(6, 8), (7, 8)]. So (6, 8) is part of his body. He cannot go UP into his own body. He dies.\n  - He can go DOWN to (6, 6). Safe.\n  - He can go LEFT to (5, 7). Safe.\n  - He can go RIGHT to (7, 7). Safe? (7, 7) is currently empty.\n- If he goes UP (suicide), I win.\n- If he goes DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, he is far away from me.\n- **Is (2, 8) safe from the enemy's head?**\n  - Enemy is at (6, 7). Max speed is 1 square. He cannot reach (2, 8) this turn.\n  - Enemy body is at (6, 8) and (7, 8). (2, 8) is far away.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (3, 7)**:\n- I am moving toward the apple at (0, 5) and (2, 1).\n- My new head: (3, 7).\n- My new body: [(4, 8)]? No, wait. My body is [(4, 8)]. If I move DOWN, my old head (3, 8) becomes the neck. My body becomes [(3, 8), (4, 8)]? No.\n  - Current: Head (3, 8), Body [(4, 8)].\n  - Move DOWN to (3, 7).\n  - New Head: (3, 7).\n  - New Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8)].\n- Enemy moves to (somewhere).\n- (3, 7) is currently empty.\n- Is it safe from enemy? Yes, enemy is at x=6.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- **LEFT (2, 8):** Moves me 1 step closer to apple at (1, 8). Keeps me on the top row (safe space).\n- **DOWN (3, 7):** Moves me toward the center. No immediate apple.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI am chasing the apple at (1, 8). It is only 2 steps away.\nThe enemy is at (6, 7).\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 8), I am in a prime position to eat the apple next turn.\nThe enemy is likely to move toward the bottom apples or try to survive.\nI am currently winning the positional battle. I control the top-left. I should secure the apple there immediately.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 8), I am safe.\n- The only way I die is if the enemy somehow teleports to (2, 8) (impossible) or if I trap myself later (irrelevant for this move).\n- The enemy might try to cut me off if I go DOWN, but going LEFT guarantees the apple next turn.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nGo **LEFT**. Secure the apple at (1, 8) next turn. Tie the score. Dominate the flank.\n\nLETS GOOOO!\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're on Turn 7 and the pressure is mounting! Let's analyze the board state carefully.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 8)\n- **My Body:** [(3, 8)]\n- **My Tail:** (3, 8) (since the body list is just one segment, the tail is the last element)\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 7)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 7), (6, 8)] (Wait, looking at the prompt again: \"Snake #0 - Head: (5, 7), Body: [(6, 7), (6, 8)]\")\n  - Let me double-check the visual map for accuracy.\n  - Row 8: `. A 1 T . . T . . .` -> (2,8) is me (1), (3,8) is my tail (T), (6,8) is Enemy Tail (T).\n  - Row 7: `. . . . . 0 T . . .` -> (5,7) is Enemy Head (0), (6,7) is Enemy Body (T).\n  - *Correction:* The prompt text says \"Body: [(6, 7), (6, 8)]\". In HEAD-TO-TAIL order, (6,7) is the neck, (6,8) is the tail. This matches the visual map.\n\n**MOVES FROM (2, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):**\n    - Row 9: `9 . A . . . . . . . .`\n    - (2, 9) is empty (represented by a dot).\n    - **Is it safe?** Yes, it's empty and inside the board.\n    - **Is it smart?** It moves me towards the apple at (1, 9). However, it puts me in a corner (top wall). If I go up, I might limit my future options unless I keep moving along the top edge.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 7):**\n    - Row 7: `7 . . . . . 0 T . . .`\n    - (2, 7) is empty.\n    - **Is it safe?** Yes, it's empty.\n    - **Is it smart?** This moves me toward the center. However, looking at the board, the enemy is at (5, 7). If I go down to (2, 7), I am on the same horizontal row as the enemy. The distance is 3 tiles (x=2 to x=5).\n    - **Risk:** If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 7), the distance shrinks. If they move LEFT again next turn, they could threaten me. Also, there are no apples immediately in this direction.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 8):**\n    - Row 8: `. A 1 T . . T . . .`\n    - (1, 8) is an Apple ('A').\n    - **Is it safe?** Yes, it's an apple.\n    - **Is it smart?** HELL YES.\n    - **Immediate Benefit:** I eat the apple. I grow. My score becomes 2 (tying the enemy).\n    - **Growth:** My body becomes [(2, 8), (3, 8)].\n    - **Future Options:** From (1, 8), I can potentially go UP to (1, 9) for the apple there, or LEFT to (0, 8), or DOWN to (1, 7). I am securing the top-left corner.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n    - **DEATH.** That is my current body segment. Moving right puts my head into my own tail. Instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DECISION ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT** is the winning move. It secures an apple immediately, which is crucial. The apple at (1, 8) is the closest and safest target.\n- **UP** is a secondary option but delays apple acquisition.\n- **DOWN** moves me away from the apple and brings me closer to the enemy's horizontal space without gain.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (1, 8). Tie the score. From there, I will likely have options to secure the apple at (1, 9) or maneuver around the enemy. The enemy is at (5, 7) and seems to be moving in the lower right quadrant. I own the top-left. Let's keep it that way.\n\nLEFT",

Let's look at the board. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 8) (I ate the apple last turn, didn't I?)\n*   **My Body:** [(2, 8), (3, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 7) (He moved LEFT from (5, 7)!)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 7), (6, 7)]\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nOkay, chat, things are heating up! I'm at (1, 8) looking at my surroundings. The enemy is getting closer\u2014he moved from (5, 7) to (4, 7). He's looking hungry.\n\nLet's break down my options from (1, 8):\n\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 8):**\n    *   Is it safe? It's empty space.\n    *   Is it smart? **YES.** This is the move. I'm securing the wall. I'm not running blindly into the enemy's face. I'm positioning myself on the edge, which gives me options. I can bounce along the top or dip down later. It keeps me away from that enemy cluster forming in the middle.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):**\n    *   Is it safe? Let's check... The enemy is at (4, 7). The cells (2, 7) and (3, 7) are empty. Distance is 2 tiles.\n    *   Is it smart? **RISKY.** If I go down, I'm entering the main highway. If the enemy decides to rush me\u2014maybe going LEFT again to (3, 7)\u2014we could have a collision. He has the same length as me (3 segments). If we clash, we both die. That's a draw, and I don't play for draws. I play to WIN.\n\n3.  **UP to (1, 9):**\n    *   Is it safe? It's an Apple ('A')!\n    *   Is it smart? **TACTICALLY NO.** While it's an apple, it puts me in the top-right corner. From (1, 9), my only safe moves would be DOWN or LEFT (RIGHT is a wall). That limits my escape routes. Plus, the enemy is moving closer. If I go UP, I'm cornering myself while he advances. I need to stay mobile.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **DEATH.** That's my own body. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI need to dominate the board, not just chase apples blindly. The enemy is pushing from the right. I need to hold the left flank. By moving **LEFT** to (0, 8), I'm hugging the wall, giving myself a \"safe zone\" on my left side (literally the edge of the map). This forces the enemy to come to me on *my* terms, or loop all the way around. It also keeps the apple at (1, 9) as a potential future target if I need to grow.\n\nLet's box him in! We're playing chess, not checkers.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's break down this move. We're at Turn 9 and the score is tied 2-2. It's CRUNCH time. We need to outmaneuver Snake #0 and secure the lead.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (0, 8)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 8), (2, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(4, 7), (5, 7)]\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nI'm hugging the left wall at (0, 8). The enemy is at (3, 7). Let's look at my options:\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):**\n    *   It's empty. Safe from walls.\n    *   **Risk:** This is the corner. From (0, 9), my only moves next turn are DOWN or RIGHT. If the enemy cuts me off at (1, 9), I'm cooked. Too limiting.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):**\n    *   It's empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This holds the left wall but keeps me low. The enemy is currently at y=7. If he moves LEFT to (2, 7) or (2, 8) to cut me off, I might get squeezed. Not bad, but maybe passive.\n\n3.  **LEFT:**\n    *   **DEATH.** I'm already at the wall. Game over if I try to walk through it. \ud83d\udeab\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n    *   **DEATH.** That's my own body (specifically my neck). I'm currently at (0, 8), and my body segments are at (1, 8) and (2, 8). Moving right hits (1, 8). Instant crash. \u274c\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nSo, I'm stuck on the wall. I have two safe moves: UP or DOWN.\n*   **UP** puts me in the corner, which is dangerous because it limits my escape routes. I don't want to get boxed in.\n*   **DOWN** keeps me mobile. From (0, 7), I have access to (0, 6), (1, 7), and potentially (0, 8) once my tail moves.\n\nWait, let's check the board state more closely.\nBoard Row 8: `1 T T . . . . . . .`\nMy head is at 0,8. Body is at 1,8 and 2,8.\nIf I move UP to (0,9), I am safe for this turn.\nHowever, looking at the apples:\n(0,5) is an apple on the left wall.\n(0,4) is an apple on the left wall.\n(0,0) is an apple on the left wall.\n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (0, 7), I am moving toward the apple at (0, 5). I am staying on the safe edge. I am maintaining flexibility.\nIf I go UP to (0,9), I am moving *away* from the apples on the left side (0,5, 0,4, 0,0). I am also trapping myself in the corner.\n\nEnemy analysis: Snake #0 is at (3,7). He is currently not adjacent to my potential move to (0,7). He has his own apples to chase. He is likely to move toward the apples in the center or stay mobile.\nIf I go DOWN to (0,7), I am safe. I am not moving into him. He is far away.\nIf I go UP to (0,9), I am safe. But I am cornering myself.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to avoid getting trapped. The corner at (0,9) is a \"dead zone\" eventually. I need to stay in the game and keep my options open.\nI will move **DOWN** to (0, 7). This keeps me on the left wall but at a lower Y-coordinate, giving me more vertical space to maneuver and chasing the apples on the left side (like the one at (0, 5)). This is the safer, more strategic play to maintain board control.\n\nLet's slide down and keep the pressure on!\n\nDOWN",

Alright, let's break down this Turn 10.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (0, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(0, 8), (1, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 8) *(He moved UP last turn)*\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 7), (4, 7)]\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nLast turn I moved DOWN to (0, 7). Smart move. I kept my options open on the wall.\nNow look at the enemy! Snake #0 moved UP from (3, 7) to (3, 8). He is directly to my RIGHT at the same Y-level. We are lined up horizontally on row 8.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 8), I hit my own body. DEAD. \u274c\nIf I move **LEFT**, I hit the wall. DEAD. \u274c\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 7), I am moving diagonally adjacent to the enemy head at (3, 8). Is he moving into me?\n*   If he moves **LEFT** to (2, 8), he is safe. He is not moving into my body.\n*   If he moves **DOWN** to (3, 7), he hits his own body. DEAD.\n*   If he moves **RIGHT** to (4, 8), he is safe.\n*   If he moves **UP** to (3, 9), he is safe.\n\n**Wait, let's look at the board geometry.**\nMy head is at (0, 7).\nEnemy head is at (3, 8).\nThe apple at (2, 1) is directly between us vertically? No, that's far down.\nThe apple at (1, 8) is my body.\nThe apple at (2, 1) is way down.\nThe apple at (1, 2) is down.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI am at (0, 7).\nAvailable moves:\n1.  **UP (0, 8):** **DEAD.** Own body.\n2.  **LEFT:** **DEAD.** Wall.\n3.  **RIGHT (1, 7):** Empty? Let's check the board.\n    Board Row 7: `1 . . T T . . . . .`\n    Wait, the board state says: Row 7 is `1 . . T T . . . . .`\n    Coordinates:\n    (0,7): 1 (My head)\n    (1,7): .\n    (2,7): .\n    (3,7): T (Enemy body)\n    (4,7): T (Enemy body)\n\n    So (1, 7) is EMPTY.\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7), am I safe?\n    The enemy is at (3, 8).\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), we are not colliding.\n    If he moves DOWN to (3, 7), he hits his own body.\n    If he moves UP to (3, 9), he is safe.\n    If he moves RIGHT to (4, 8), he is safe.\n\n    **CRITICAL ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n    Snake #0 is at (3, 8).\n    He is surrounded by his own body at (3, 7) and (4, 7).\n    He has apples at (4, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5) to the right/down.\n    He has apples at (2, 1), (1, 2) to the left/down.\n    The most dangerous move for him is LEFT to (2, 8) or UP to (3, 9).\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), he enters the center area.\n    If he moves UP to (3, 9), he goes to the top row.\n\n    **HEAD-ON COLLISION POTENTIAL:**\n    If I move **RIGHT to (1, 7)** and he moves **DOWN to (3, 7)**, he dies (hitting his own body). I live.\n    If I move **RIGHT to (1, 7)** and he moves **LEFT to (2, 8)**, we don't collide.\n    If I move **RIGHT to (1, 7)** and he moves **UP to (3, 9)**, we don't collide.\n\n    **The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\n    I need to dominate the board.\n    If I move **DOWN to (0, 6)**, I am moving toward the apple at (0, 5).\n    Let's look at (0, 6). It's empty.\n    Is (0, 6) safer than (1, 7)?\n    (0, 6) keeps me on the wall. (1, 7) moves me into the \"open\" but towards the enemy's vertical column (x=3).\n\n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    (0, 5) is right below me.\n    (1, 2) is down and right.\n    (2, 1) is down and right.\n    (4, 2) is down and right (enemy territory?).\n    (5, 3) is down and right.\n\n    **DECISION:**\n    I cannot go UP or LEFT. I must go DOWN or RIGHT.\n    **RIGHT to (1, 7)**:\n    *   Moves me into the open.\n    *   Positions me to intercept apples at (1, 2) or (2, 1).\n    *   Puts me 2 squares away from the enemy head (3, 8).\n    *   Risk: If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8) and I am at (1, 7), we are not colliding. But next turn, if I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we crash.\n    *   However, if I go DOWN, I am on the wall.\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy at (3, 8). He has a body at (3, 7) and (4, 7).\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), he is moving towards me.\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7), I am moving towards him.\n    \n    Is there a trap?\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I open up moves to (2, 7) and (1, 6).\n    If I go DOWN to (0, 6), I stay on the wall.\n    \n    **Aggressive Play:**\n    I want to box him in. He is at x=3. I am at x=0.\n    If I move RIGHT, I advance towards the center.\n    If I move DOWN, I retreat to the corner (0,5).\n    \n    Wait, look at the board state for Row 8: `T T . 0 . . . . . .`\n    Enemy head is at (3, 8). Body at (2, 8)? No, body is at (3, 7) and (4, 7).\n    Row 8: (0,8) is my body, (1,8) is my body. (2,8) is empty.\n    \n    If I move **RIGHT to (1, 7)**:\n    My new head: (1, 7).\n    Enemy head: (3, 8).\n    Distance: 2 squares (Manhattan distance).\n    \n    If Enemy moves **LEFT to (2, 8)**:\n    Distance becomes: (1,7) vs (2,8). Diagonal. Safe.\n    If Enemy moves **UP to (3, 9)**:\n    Distance becomes: (1,7) vs (3,9). Safe.\n    If Enemy moves **DOWN to (3, 7)**:\n    He hits his own body. He dies. I win immediately.\n    \n    So moving **RIGHT** is safe against all enemy moves *except* if he moves into my future path, but we are moving simultaneously.\n    \n    **What about DOWN to (0, 6)?**\n    (0, 6) is empty.\n    This is the \"safe\" wall move. It grabs the apple at (0, 5) next turn.\n    But does it help me box the enemy? No. It keeps me on the edge.\n    The enemy is at x=3. To box him, I need to control the center.\n    \n    **The \"CUT OFF\" Maneuver:**\n    The enemy is at (3, 8). The area to his left (x=2) is open.\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I threaten to take x=2.\n    If he goes LEFT to (2, 8), he takes x=2.\n    \n    Let's look at the apples near me.\n    (1, 2) is an apple. (2, 1) is an apple.\n    To get there, I need to move RIGHT.\n    (0, 5) is an apple. To get there, I need to move DOWN.\n    \n    **Score is tied 2-2.**\n    I need to be aggressive. Staying on the wall (DOWN) is passive. The enemy is already in the center.\n    If I move RIGHT, I enter the \"arena\".\n    \n    Let's check collision possibilities carefully.\n    My move: RIGHT -> (1, 7).\n    Enemy potential moves:\n    1.  LEFT -> (2, 8). (1,7) vs (2,8). No collision.\n    2.  UP -> (3, 9). (1,7) vs (3,9). No collision.\n    3.  RIGHT -> (4, 8). (1,7) vs (4,8). No collision.\n    4.  DOWN -> (3, 7). Enemy hits own body. I win.\n    \n    Is there any move that kills ME?\n    If Enemy moves to (1, 7)? No, he is at (3, 8). He can't reach (1, 7) in one move.\n    \n    So **RIGHT** is safe.\n    \n    Is **DOWN** better?\n    DOWN -> (0, 6).\n    Enemy at (3, 8).\n    Distance increases.\n    I secure the apple at (0, 5) next turn (provided it doesn't get eaten).\n    But the enemy can eat apples too.\n    \n    **The Box In Plan:**\n    The enemy is at (3, 8).\n    I am at (0, 7).\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I am closer to the center.\n    If the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 8), we are neighbors.\n    Next turn, if I go RIGHT to (2, 7) and he goes LEFT to (1, 8), we crash? No, he would be at (1, 8) (my old body).\n    \n    Actually, let's look at the board geometry.\n    My body is at (0, 8) and (1, 8).\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7), my body moves to (0, 8) and (1, 8).\n    \n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8):\n    He is at (2, 8).\n    I am at (1, 7).\n    Next turn, I can move UP to (1, 8)? No, that's my body (tail is moving though).\n    I can move RIGHT to (2, 7).\n    He can move LEFT to (1, 8).\n    \n    **Wait, let's look at the tail movement.**\n    My tail is at (2, 8)? No, wait.\n    My body list: Head (0, 7), then (0, 8), then (1, 8).\n    So tail is (1, 8)? No, list is Head->Tail.\n    (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8).\n    Tail is (1, 8).\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7):\n    New Head: (1, 7).\n    New Body: (1, 7) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8).\n    Tail becomes (0, 8)? No, the old tail (1, 8) is removed.\n    So new body is (1, 7), (0, 7).\n    Wait, the old body was (0, 8), (1, 8).\n    New body is (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8)? No.\n    The body shifts.\n    Head moves to (1, 7).\n    Old Head (0, 7) becomes neck.\n    Old Neck (0, 8) becomes body.\n    Old Tail (1, 8) is dropped.\n    \n    So after moving RIGHT:\n    Head: (1, 7)\n    Body: (0, 7), (0, 8)\n    \n    Check safety of (1, 7):\n    Is (1, 7) in my new body? No.\n    Is (1, 7) in enemy body?\n    Enemy body: (3, 7), (4, 7). Yes! (3, 7) is at x=3.\n    Wait, (1, 7) is at x=1.\n    (1, 7) is NOT in (3, 7) or (4, 7).\n    \n    Is (1, 7) the enemy head?\n    Enemy head is at (3, 8).\n    \n    So **RIGHT** is safe.\n    \n    What about **DOWN**?\n    Move to (0, 6).\n    New Head: (0, 6).\n    New Body: (0, 7), (0, 8).\n    Tail dropped: (1, 8).\n    \n    Safety of (0, 6):\n    Own body? (0, 7), (0, 8). No.\n    Enemy body? (3, 7), (4, 7). No.\n    Enemy head? (3, 8). No.\n    \n    So **DOWN** is safe.\n    \n    **Decision Time:**\n    We are tied 2-2.\n    The enemy is at (3, 8).\n    If I go **DOWN**, I stay on the wall. I get the apple at (0, 5) eventually. This is a \"survival\" play.\n    If I go **RIGHT**, I push into the center.\n    The enemy is at x=3.\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I am at x=1.\n    The gap between us is x=2 (at y=8) and x=2 (at y=7).\n    \n    **The Trap:**\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), and the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 8):\n    Next turn, I am at (1, 7) and he is at (2, 8).\n    I can move UP to (1, 8)? No, that's my body (which will be at (0, 8) and (0, 7)? No wait).\n    \n    Let's trace the body movement for RIGHT again.\n    Current: Head (0,7), Body [(0,8), (1,8)].\n    Move RIGHT -> (1, 7).\n    New Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8)].\n    Tail (1, 8) is vacated.\n    \n    If Enemy moves LEFT -> (2, 8).\n    Positions:\n    Me: (1, 7)\n    Enemy: (2, 8)\n    My Body: (0, 7), (0, 8).\n    Enemy Body: (3, 7), (4, 7) (assuming he didn't grow).\n    \n    Next turn options (projecting):\n    I can move RIGHT to (2, 7).\n    I can move UP to (1, 8).\n    I can move DOWN to (1, 6).\n    I cannot move LEFT (into own body at 0,7).\n    \n    If I move RIGHT to (2, 7) and he moves LEFT to (1, 8):\n    Collision? No. (2,7) vs (1,8).\n    \n    If I move UP to (1, 8) and he moves LEFT to (1, 8)?\n    That's a head-on collision. Both die.\n    If I have higher score, I win.\n    Currently 2-2.\n    If we crash and die, it's a draw or I lose (if rules say equal score = draw).\n    \n    **Let's look at the board again.**\n    There is an apple at (2, 1).\n    There is an apple at (1, 2).\n    Moving RIGHT puts me in a position to chase these.\n    Moving DOWN puts me on a path to (0, 5), but then I have to loop back up or right to get to the other apples.\n    \n    **Aggression is key.**\n    The enemy is at (3, 8).\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7), I am \"pushing\" the center line.\n    If the enemy retreats (moves UP or RIGHT), I gain ground.\n    If the enemy advances (moves LEFT), we enter a close-quarters combat zone.\n    \n    **Why DOWN might be bad:**\n    If I go DOWN to (0, 6), I am essentially ignoring the enemy.\n    If the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 8), he controls the space between x=1 and x=3.\n    If he then goes DOWN to (2, 7), he cuts off the center.\n    By going RIGHT now, I claim the space at x=1, y=7.\n    \n    **Wait, let's check the apple at (1, 2).**\n    From (1, 7), it's 5 moves down.\n    From (0, 6), it's 6 moves down + 1 right.\n    \n    **The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\n    The goal is to force him into a corner.\n    He is at x=3. x=2 is the dividing line.\n    By moving to (1, 7), I am close to x=2.\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), he is right next to me (diagonally).\n    If he moves LEFT, I can potentially cut him off next turn.\n    \n    **Actually, let's look at the apples on the left side.**\n    (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 0).\n    If I go DOWN, I secure these.\n    If I go RIGHT, I leave them.\n    However, the enemy is on the right side (x=3).\n    If I take the left side, he takes the right side.\n    The game ends at 150 turns or 30 apples.\n    We are at turn 10. 2-2 score.\n    To win, I need more apples than him.\n    The apples on the left are isolated.\n    The apples in the center (1,2), (2,1), (4,2) etc are clustered.\n    \n    **CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\n    The enemy is at (3, 8). His body is at (3, 7) and (4, 7).\n    If he wants to go to the apples at (4, 2), (5, 3), he needs to go DOWN.\n    If he goes DOWN, he might get stuck behind his own body?\n    His body is at (3, 7). To go down from (3, 8), he goes to (3, 7).\n    (3, 7) is his body! He cannot move DOWN.\n    So his only safe moves from (3, 8) are LEFT, UP, or RIGHT.\n    \n    **If I move RIGHT to (1, 7):**\n    I am moving towards the center.\n    He cannot move DOWN. He is stuck on the top rows (y=7, 8, 9).\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), I am at (1, 7).\n    If he moves UP to (3, 9), he goes to the corner.\n    If he moves RIGHT to (4, 8), he goes further right.\n    \n    **If I move DOWN to (0, 6):**\n    I am moving away from him.\n    He is stuck on the top rows.\n    We are basically playing on different halves of the board.\n    \n    **Which is better?**\n    If we split the board, I need to eat apples faster than him.\n    Left side apples: (0,5), (0,4), (0,0). (Also (1,2) is close).\n    Right side apples: (4,2), (5,3), (5,5), (8,3), (8,4), (9,1), (9,2).\n    The right side has MORE apples.\n    If I let him have the right side, he will outscore me.\n    \n    **I must invade the center.**\n    I need to contest the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 2).\n    Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) is the first step to invading the center.\n    Moving DOWN to (0, 6) concedes the center to him (once he untangles himself).\n    \n    **The Untangle:**\n    He is at (3, 8). Body (3, 7), (4, 7).\n    He will likely move LEFT to (2, 8) to get out of the corner of his own body.\n    If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), he opens up the path to move DOWN to (2, 7) next turn.\n    If I am at (1, 7), I am right next to (2, 7).\n    If I go RIGHT to (1, 7), I am in position to challenge him for (2, 7) or (2, 6).\n    \n    **Let's check safety again.**\n    Moving RIGHT to (1, 7).\n    Is (1, 7) safe?\n    Yes.\n    Is there a risk of head-on collision?\n    Only if he moves to (1, 7). He is at x=3. He can't reach x=1 in one move.\n    Is there a risk of me hitting him next turn?\n    Depends on his move.\n    \n    **Let's look at the apple at (2, 1).**\n    It's a prime target.\n    To get there, I need to be at x=2.\n    Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) gets me closer to x=2.\n    \n    **Decision:**\n    I will move **RIGHT**.\n    This is the aggressive play.\n    It secures my position in the center.\n    It prevents the enemy from easily sweeping the left-side apples (like 1,2 and 2,1) without contest.\n    If he stays on the right, I claim the center/left.\n    If he comes to the center, we fight.\n    \n    **Plan:**\n    1. Move RIGHT to (1, 7).\n    2. Prepare to chase apples at (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n    3. Watch out for the enemy moving LEFT. If he moves LEFT to (2, 8), we are neighbors.\n    \n    **Check for traps:**\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 7), and he moves LEFT to (2, 8).\n    Next turn:\n    My options: (2, 7), (1, 8), (1, 6).\n    His options: (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 8), (2, 7).\n    If we both go for (2, 7), head-on collision. Draw (2-2).\n    If we both go for (1, 8), head-on collision.\n    I need to calculate if I can force a win.\n    Since I'm at 2 apples and he's at 2, a draw keeps us tied.\n    But if I eat an apple first (by moving towards (1,2) or (2,1)), I get to 3.\n    Then I can force a head-on collision and win.\n    \n    So getting to the apples first is crucial.\n    (1, 7) is closer to (1, 2) and (2, 1) than (0, 6) is.\n    \n    **Conclusion:**\n    Move RIGHT. Claim the space. Hunt the apples.\n    Chat, let's do this!\n\nRIGHT",

I'm at (1, 7) after moving RIGHT last turn.\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 9) *(Looks like he went UP to the top row)*\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 8), (3, 7)]\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nI moved into the open space. The enemy retreated to the top corner (3, 9). He's cornering himself, which is good for me!\nI need to press the advantage.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):** \u274c **DEAD!** My body is at (0, 8), but wait... actually, looking at the board, (1, 8) is currently an apple! However, checking my previous turn's logic, my body *was* at (0, 8) and (1, 8). Let me re-verify the tail movement.\n    *   Previous Head: (0, 7)\n    *   Previous Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)]\n    *   I moved RIGHT to (1, 7).\n    *   **New Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 8)].\n    *   **Tail:** (0, 8) is now the last segment.\n    *   **WAIT!** Looking at the board state provided: Row 8 is `T . . T . . . . . .`. The 'T' at (1, 8) is my old body.\n    *   When I move, the tail (1, 8) disappears.\n    *   So, (1, 8) is currently EMPTY (and an apple!).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, it's empty.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** \u2705 **SAFE.** It's empty. (1, 6) is currently `.`.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** \u2705 **SAFE.** It's empty. (0, 7) is `.`.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** \u274c **DEAD.** The board shows Row 7: `T . . T T . . . . .`. (3, 7) is an enemy body segment. (2, 7) is empty, but let's check the *bodies*.\n    *   Enemy body is at (3, 7) and (4, 7). (2, 7) is empty.\n    *   Wait, the board shows: `1 . . T T . . . . .` (Row 7)\n    *   (1,7) is my head. (2,7) is empty. (3,7) is Enemy Body. (4,7) is Enemy Body.\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 7) is SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 9). He is trapped in the top right corner.\nIf I move **UP to (1, 8)**, I grab an apple and position myself to cut him off.\nHowever, if I move UP, I am at (1, 8). The enemy is at (3, 9).\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes to (3, 8). I am safe.\nIf he moves LEFT, he goes to (2, 9). I am safe.\nIf he moves RIGHT, he hits the wall. Dead.\nIf he moves DOWN-LEFT? He can't. He moves one square.\n\n**Wait, let's look at the board again.**\nRow 8: `T . . T . . . . . .` (0,8)=T, (1,8)=Apple?, (2,8)=., (3,8)=T.\nActually, the board state shows apples listed separately.\nApples: (1, 9), (1, 2), (0, 0), (0, 5), (4, 2), (8, 3), (2, 1), (8, 4), (5, 3), (4, 1), (6, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (0, 4), (5, 5)\n(1, 8) is NOT in the apple list.\n(1, 9) IS in the apple list.\n(0, 4) IS in the apple list.\n\nLet's re-read the board visual.\nRow 8: `T . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . . .` (Apple at 1,9)\n\nIf I move **UP to (1, 8)**:\nI am at (1, 8).\nI am next to the enemy at (3, 9) and the apple at (1, 9).\nIf I go to (1, 8), I am blocking his path down.\nIf he goes DOWN to (3, 8), he is safe (his own body is at 3,7? No, 3,8 was his body last turn. Wait, his head moved to 3,9. His body is now 3,8 and 3,7).\nSo if he goes DOWN, he is moving into his own body? No, his head was at (3,9). His body was at (3,8), (3,7). He moves DOWN to (3,8). That is occupied by his own body. **HE DIES.**\nWait, let's trace snake #0.\nTurn 10: Head (3,9), Body [(3,8), (3,7)].\nTurn 11: He moves.\nIf he moves DOWN to (3,8): That is his current body. **SUICIDE.**\nIf he moves LEFT to (2,9): Empty.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (4,9): Wall.\nIf he moves UP to (3,10): Wall.\n\nSo, if I move UP to (1, 8):\n1. I am at (1, 8).\n2. The enemy MUST move LEFT to (2, 9) or he dies (by moving into his own body or wall).\n3. If he moves LEFT to (2, 9), we are separated.\n4. I can then try to go for the apple at (1, 9) on the next turn.\n\n**Alternative: DOWN to (1, 6).**\nThis is safe but passive. The enemy is cornering himself. I should push the advantage.\nThe apple at (0, 4) is below me.\nThe apple at (1, 2) is below me.\nBut the enemy is currently helpless at (3, 9).\n\n**Alternative: LEFT to (0, 7).**\nBack to the wall. Safe, but gives up ground.\n\n**Alternative: RIGHT to (2, 7).**\nMoves me towards the center.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 7):\nEnemy at (3, 9) moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nDistance: (2,7) vs (2,9). Vertical gap of 2.\nIf I go RIGHT, I open up paths to (2, 6) or (3, 7).\n(3, 7) is enemy body. (3, 8) is enemy body.\n(2, 6) is empty.\n\n**Let's compare UP vs RIGHT.**\n**UP (1, 8):**\n*   Pros: Closer to apple (1, 9). Blocks enemy escape downwards. Forces enemy to stay in corner (2,9) or die. High aggression.\n*   Cons: Exposes me slightly if enemy miraculously escapes (unlikely).\n*   **Safety check:** If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 9), I am at (1, 8). We are diagonal. Safe.\n    *   If enemy moves DOWN (suicide), I am safe.\n    *   If enemy moves RIGHT (wall), I am safe.\n    *   If enemy moves UP (wall), I am safe.\n\n**RIGHT (2, 7):**\n*   Pros: Moves to center. Approaches apples (2, 1) and (1, 2).\n*   Cons: Gives up the apple at (1, 9) for now.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is trapped. I should press the attack and grab the apple at (1, 9) if possible, or at least block him completely.\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), I am in prime position to take (1, 9) next turn.\nThe enemy is forced to move LEFT to (2, 9).\nNext turn:\nMy head at (1, 8). Enemy at (2, 9).\nI can move UP to (1, 9) to eat the apple.\nEnemy can move LEFT to (1, 9)? No, he is at (2, 9). He can move to (1, 9) or (2, 8) or (3, 9).\nIf I go to (1, 9) and he goes to (1, 9) -> Head on collision. We both die. Score 2-2. Draw? Or I win if I have more? We are tied 2-2. It's a draw.\nIf I go to (1, 9) and he goes to (2, 8):\n(2, 8) is currently empty (his body was at 3,8 and 3,7). Wait, his body is (3,8) and (3,7). (2, 8) is empty.\nIs (2, 8) safe for him?\nHis body: (3, 8), (3, 7).\nIf he moves to (2, 8), he is safe.\nI am at (1, 9). He is at (2, 8). We are diagonal. Safe.\n\nIs there a risk in moving UP?\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), and he moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nNext turn, I go UP to (1, 9). He goes LEFT to (1, 9)? That's a head-on collision. We tie.\nBut maybe I can block him better.\nIf I stay at (1, 8) and he is at (2, 9).\nHe can't move DOWN (3,9 -> 3,8 is his body).\nHe can't move RIGHT (wall).\nHe can't move UP (wall).\nHe MUST move LEFT.\nSo he moves to (1, 9).\nIf I am at (1, 8), and he moves to (1, 9), he is safe.\nThen I am stuck at (1, 8).\n\n**Wait, if I move UP to (1, 8).**\nHe is at (3, 9).\nHe MUST move LEFT to (2, 9).\nNow it's turn 12.\nI am at (1, 8). He is at (2, 9).\nHe is forced to move LEFT again to (1, 9).\nI am at (1, 8).\nIf I move UP to (1, 9), we collide. Draw.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8), he moves to (1, 9). Safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 7), he moves to (1, 9). Safe.\n\n**Can I trap him?**\nHe is at (3, 9).\nI am at (1, 8).\nHe moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nI move UP to (1, 9).\nHe moves LEFT to (1, 9)? No, he is at (2, 9). He can only go to (1, 9).\nIf I am at (1, 9), he moves to (1, 9) -> Collision.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n**DOWN to (1, 6):**\nSafe. But gives up the corner.\n**LEFT to (0, 7):**\nSafe. But passive.\n**RIGHT to (2, 7):**\nSafe. Moves to center.\n\n**The Box In:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 9). He is dead man walking.\nI should move **UP to (1, 8)**.\nWhy?\n1. It gets me closer to the apple at (1, 9).\n2. It keeps the pressure on.\n3. If he moves LEFT to (2, 9), I can chase him or take the apple.\n\n**Actually, let's look at the board state again.**\nRow 8: `T . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . . .`\n(0,8)=T, (1,8)=Apple?, (2,8)=., (3,8)=T.\nWait, the apple list says (1, 9) is an apple. Not (1, 8).\nSo (1, 8) is just empty space.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 8):\nI am at (1, 8).\nEnemy at (3, 9) -> moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nTurn 12:\nMe: (1, 8). Enemy: (2, 9).\nEnemy moves LEFT to (1, 9) (forced).\nI move UP to (1, 9).\n**HEAD ON COLLISION.**\nWe both die. Score 2-2.\nIs this good?\nThe rules say: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"\nIf I die now, it's a draw. I want to WIN.\n\n**Avoid the draw.**\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), I force a potential draw.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7), I give him space to live, but I gain center control.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6), I let him rot in the corner.\n\n**Let's look at the board again.**\nIs there any way to block him without dying?\nHe is at (3, 9).\nI am at (1, 7).\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), he is at (3, 9).\nHe moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nI am at (1, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8)?\n(2, 8) is currently empty.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8):\nI am at (2, 8).\nHe is at (2, 9).\nIf he moves LEFT to (1, 9), he is safe.\nIf he moves DOWN to (2, 8), he hits me. **HE DIES.**\nWait, if he moves DOWN to (2, 8) and I am at (2, 8), he dies.\nBut he is at (2, 9). He can move DOWN to (2, 8).\nCan he?\nHis body is at (3, 8) and (3, 7).\n(2, 8) is empty.\nSo he *can* move DOWN to (2, 8).\nIf I am at (2, 8), he moves into me. **I WIN.**\n\n**So the plan is:**\n1. Move **RIGHT to (2, 7)**.\n2. Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 9) (forced, or dies).\n3. Turn 12: I am at (2, 7). Enemy at (2, 9).\n4. I move UP to (2, 8).\n5. Enemy is at (2, 9).\n   - If he moves DOWN to (2, 8), he hits me. **I WIN.**\n   - If he moves LEFT to (1, 9), he is safe.\n   - If he moves RIGHT (wall) or UP (wall), he dies.\n\n**Wait, can he move LEFT to (1, 9) from (2, 9)?**\nYes.\nIf he moves LEFT to (1, 9), I am at (2, 8).\nWe are diagonal. Safe.\nThen I can move LEFT to (1, 8) or UP to (2, 9).\nIf I move UP to (2, 9), he is gone.\n\n**Actually, let's look at the HEAD-ON COLLISION rule.**\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7), and he moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nNext turn:\nI move UP to (2, 8).\nHe moves DOWN to (2, 8).\n**BOTH DIE.**\n\n**Wait, if I move RIGHT to (2, 7).**\nHe is at (3, 9).\nHe MUST move LEFT to (2, 9).\nNow:\nMy head: (2, 7). Enemy head: (2, 9).\nMy body: (1, 7), (0, 7).\nEnemy body: (3, 8), (3, 7).\n\nNext turn (Turn 12):\nI move UP to (2, 8).\nHe moves DOWN to (2, 8).\n**CRASH.** We both die. Draw (2-2).\n\n**I don't want a draw.**\nI want to win.\nHow do I win?\nI need to eat an apple first to get to 3, then force a collision.\nOR\nI need to trap him so he dies without me dying.\n\n**Let's look at the board geometry again.**\nEnemy at (3, 9).\nI am at (1, 7).\nIf I move UP to (1, 8).\nEnemy moves LEFT to (2, 9).\nI am at (1, 8). Enemy at (2, 9).\nI move UP to (1, 9).\nEnemy moves LEFT to (1, 9).\n**CRASH.** Draw.\n\n**Is there a move that forces HIM to crash into a wall or his own body?**\nHe is at (3, 9).\nHe can only move LEFT to (2, 9).\nHe cannot move DOWN (3, 8 is his body).\nHe cannot move RIGHT (Wall).\nHe cannot move UP (Wall).\n**He is forced to move LEFT.**\nUnless... is (3, 8) his body?\nYes, body is (3, 8), (3, 7).\nSo he must go to (2, 9).\n\n**If I stay away.**\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6).\nHe moves to (2, 9).\nNext turn, he moves to (1, 9) or (2, 8).\nIf he moves to (2, 8), he is moving towards his own body? No, his body is (3, 8).\nIf he moves to (1, 9), he is safe.\n\n**Okay, let's look at the apple at (2, 1).**\nIt's far away.\nThe apple at (1, 9) is right there.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\nI cannot force a win against a cornered snake without risking a draw if we are tied on points.\nI am tied 2-2.\nIf I take an apple, I go to 3.\nThen I can force a collision and win.\n\n**Which move gets me an apple fastest?**\n1. **UP to (1, 8):** Adjacent to (1, 9). Next turn I can eat (1, 9) -> Score 3.\n   *   Enemy moves to (2, 9).\n   *   If I go for (1, 9), he can go to (1, 9) -> Draw.\n   *   But wait. If I am at (1, 8) and he is at (2, 9).\n   *   I move UP to (1, 9).\n   *   He moves LEFT to (1, 9).\n   *   We crash.\n   *   **Result:** Draw.\n   *   I don't want a draw.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Moves to center.\n   *   Enemy goes to (2, 9).\n   *   I can move to (2, 6) or (1, 7) or (3, 7) or (2, 8).\n   *   (2, 6) leads to (2, 1) eventually.\n   *   (3, 7) is enemy body.\n   *   (2, 8) is risky (enemy at 2,9).\n\n3. **DOWN to (1, 6):** Goes for (0, 5) or (1, 2).\n   *   (0, 5) is safe.\n   *   (1, 2) is safe.\n   *   This avoids the enemy entirely for a while.\n\n**Let's look at the apples again.**\nApples: (1, 9), (1, 2), (0, 0), (0, 5), (4, 2), (8, 3), (2, 1), (8, 4), (5, 3), (4, 1), (6, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (0, 4), (5, 5)\n\n**If I move DOWN to (1, 6):**\nI am safe.\nI can go for (0, 5) or (1, 2).\nThe enemy is stuck at (3, 9).\nHe will eventually have to move to (2, 9).\nThen he is stuck in the top row.\nI can eat apples and grow.\nWhen I am larger (3+ apples), I can come back and trap him.\n\n**Is (1, 6) safe?**\nRow 6: ` . . . . . . . . . . ` (All empty).\nYes.\n\n**Is there any apple closer?**\n(0, 5) is distance 2 (Down, Left).\n(1, 2) is distance 4.\n(2, 1) is distance 5.\n(1, 9) is distance 2 (Up, Up).\n\n**The problem with (1, 9) is the draw.**\nIf I go for (1, 9), I force a collision with the enemy who is forced to move there.\nSince we are tied, the game ends in a draw.\nI want to WIN.\nTherefore, I should avoid the draw.\nI should let the enemy rot in the corner and eat apples elsewhere.\nOnce I have 3 apples, I can return and force a win.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove DOWN to (1, 6).\nThis is safe.\nIt moves towards apples (0, 5) and (1, 2).\nIt avoids the immediate draw condition with the cornered enemy.\nIt allows me to grow my score.\n\n**Wait, looking at the board state again.**\nThe enemy is at (3, 9).\nIs there ANY way he survives if I don't interact?\nHe is at (3, 9).\nHe must move to (2, 9).\nFrom (2, 9), he can move to (1, 9) or (2, 8).\n(2, 8) is empty.\n(2, 8) is safe?\nHis body is (3, 8), (3, 7).\nSo (2, 8) is safe.\nIf he goes to (2, 8), he is alive.\nHe is not dead yet.\n\n**So I should not force the draw.**\nI should grow.\nMove DOWN to (1, 6).\n\n**Check safety of (1, 6) again.**\nCurrent board: Row 6 is all empty.\nMy body: (0, 7), (0, 8).\nSo (1, 6) is not in my body.\nEnemy body: (3, 7), (4, 7).\nSo (1, 6) is not in enemy body.\nIt is safe.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe enemy is cornered but not dead. He has moves.\nIf I force a collision now, it's a draw (2-2).\nI need to get to 3 apples first to secure a win.\nMoving DOWN avoids the draw trap and goes for apples (0, 5) or (1, 2).\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move DOWN to (1, 6).\n2. Next turn, move DOWN to (1, 5) or LEFT to (0, 6) to chase (0, 5).\n3. Grow to 3 apples.\n4. Then hunt the enemy.\n\nChat, let's not throw this game by forcing a draw!\n\nDOWN",

The enemy (Snake #0) is at `(1, 9)` with a body trailing down to `(2, 9)` and `(3, 9)`. He's trapped in the top-right corner!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to `(0, 9)`... wait, let's check his possible moves.\nHe is at `(1, 9)`.\n- **LEFT to (0, 9):** Empty. Safe move for him.\n- **DOWN to (1, 8):** Empty? Wait, looking at the board, `(1, 8)` is `.`. BUT, he is currently on top of an Apple at `(1, 9)`. If he eats it, he grows. Does the apple disappear before movement or after?\n*Rule check:* \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment.\"\nIf he eats the apple at `(1, 9)` and stays there (e.g., if he couldn't move), he grows. But he has to move.\nIf he moves DOWN to `(1, 8)`, he vacates `(1, 9)`.\nIf he moves LEFT to `(0, 9)`, he vacates `(1, 9)`.\n\n**The Trap:**\nI am at `(1, 6)`. I want to go UP to `(1, 7)`. But `(1, 7)` is my own body! I will die instantly if I go UP. \u274c\n**UP is DEATH.**\n\n**LEFT to (0, 6):**\n- Is it safe? `(0, 6)` is currently empty (`.`).\n- My body is at `(0, 7)` and `(1, 7)`.\n- Enemy body is at `(3, 9)`, `(2, 9)`, `(1, 9)`.\n- **Safe.**\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n- Is it safe? `(2, 6)` is currently empty (`.`).\n- **Safe.**\n\n**DOWN to (1, 5):**\n- Is it safe? `(1, 5)` is currently empty (`.`).\n- **Safe.**\n\n**WAIT, LOOK AT THE APPLE!**\nThere is an apple at `(0, 5)`! \ud83c\udf4e\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**, I am adjacent to the apple at `(0, 5)`. Next turn, I can easily eat it.\nIf I move **LEFT**, I also pull my tail `(0, 7)` forward, potentially clearing space or changing the flow.\n\n**THE ENEMY'S SITUATION:**\nThe enemy is at `(1, 9)`.\nHe cannot move DOWN to `(1, 8)`? Wait, why?\nIf he moves DOWN to `(1, 8)`, he is not hitting a wall. He is not hitting his body.\nBUT, look at the board state provided in the prompt:\n`9 . 1 . . . . . . .`\n`8 . . . T . . . . .`\nWait, the enemy head is at `(1, 9)`.\nIf he moves DOWN to `(1, 8)`, is it empty?\nThe board state shows `(1, 8)` as `.`.\nSo he CAN move DOWN.\n\n**HOWEVER...**\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**, I am moving towards the apple at `(0, 5)`.\nIf I move **RIGHT to (2, 6)**, I am moving into the center.\nIf I move **DOWN to (1, 5)**, I am moving towards apples at `(1, 2)`.\n\n**IS THERE A KILL SHOT?**\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**, can I cut him off?\nIf he moves LEFT to `(0, 9)`, he is safe.\nIf he moves DOWN to `(1, 8)`, he is safe.\n\n**BUT WAIT, WHAT IF HE IS FORCED?**\nHe is at `(1, 9)`. He has to move.\nIs there a move that kills him?\nIf I move **UP to (1, 7)**? NO, I DIE. (My body is there).\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**, I am setting up a block.\n\n**Let's look at the Board State provided in the prompt:**\nRow 8: `. . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 9: `. 1 . . . . . . . .`\nWait, the enemy head is at `(1, 9)` (ID 0).\nIf he moves **LEFT** to `(0, 9)`, he is safe.\nIf he moves **DOWN** to `(1, 8)`, he is safe (board says `.`).\n\n**Wait, is there an Apple at (1, 9)?**\nThe Apple list includes: `(1, 9)`.\nThe Board State shows: `Row 9: . 1 . . . . . . . .`\nWait, the board shows `1` (which is the Snake ID 0) at `(1, 9)`.\nSo the apple is UNDERNEATH him? Or did he just eat it?\n\"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL... Apples collected: 2\"\nIf he moves onto an apple, he grows.\nIf he is currently sitting on `(1, 9)`, and `(1, 9)` is an apple, he must have eaten it this turn or is about to grow.\nActually, the board state is the *current* state. If `(1, 9)` is an apple in the list, and he is standing there, he likely just ate it (or the prompt implies the apple is there for me to eat next?).\n\n**Let's assume the apple is there.**\nIf I move **LEFT to (0, 6)**:\n- I am safe.\n- I am chasing the apple at `(0, 5)`.\n- I am also opening up the path to `(0, 4)` (which is an apple).\n\n**Why not move RIGHT to (2, 6)?**\nCenter control is good, but the apple at `(0, 5)` is closer and safer.\nIf I go RIGHT, I might get closer to the enemy, but he is cornered. I don't want to accidentally collide.\n\n**Why not move DOWN to (1, 5)?**\nAlso valid. `(1, 2)` is an apple.\nBut `(0, 5)` is closer to my current position `(1, 6)` than `(1, 2)`.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n1. **LEFT to (0, 6)** puts me at the wall.\n2. From `(0, 6)`, I can go DOWN to `(0, 5)` to eat the apple and grow.\n3. This creates a \"box\" on the left side.\n4. The enemy is trapped on the right side (top right corner).\n\n**Is there a risk of the enemy moving LEFT into me?**\nHe is at `(1, 9)`. I am at `(1, 6)`.\nDistance is 3 squares.\nHe moves 1 square. I move 1 square.\nIf I go LEFT to `(0, 6)`, and he goes DOWN to `(1, 8)` or LEFT to `(0, 9)`, we don't collide.\n\n**Double Check:**\nMy Body: `[(1, 7), (0, 7)]`.\nIf I move LEFT to `(0, 6)`:\n- My head `(1, 6)` -> `(0, 6)`.\n- My body moves: `(1, 7)` -> `(1, 6)` (which was my old head), `(0, 7)` -> `(1, 7)`.\n- Tail `(0, 7)` disappears.\n- New Body: `[(1, 6), (1, 7)]`.\n- Is `(0, 6)` occupied by my body? No.\n- Is `(0, 6)` occupied by enemy body? No.\n\n**Decision:**\nGo **LEFT**. It's the safest route to the apples on the left side `(0, 5)` and `(0, 4)`. It avoids the risk of hitting my own tail or the enemy's body.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Turn 13: Move **LEFT** to `(0, 6)`.\n- Turn 14: Move **DOWN** to `(0, 5)` to eat the apple.\n- Grow to 3 apples.\n- Secure the win.\n\nLEFT",

Let's break this down.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n*   **Me (Snake 1):** Head at `(0, 6)`, Body at `[(1, 6), (1, 7)]`, Apples: 2.\n*   **Enemy (Snake 0):** Head at `(1, 9)`, Body at `[(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]`, Apples: 3.\n*   **The Board:** 10x10 grid.\n\n**ANALYZING THE ENEMY:**\nThe enemy is at `(1, 9)` at the top left (technically top row, second column).\n*   **Can he go LEFT to (0, 9)?** YES. Empty.\n*   **Can he go DOWN to (1, 8)?** YES. Empty.\n*   **Can he go RIGHT to (2, 9)?** NO. His own body is there (`(2, 9)`).\n*   **Can he go UP?** NO. Off the board.\n\nHe is trapped in the top row. He is forced to move DOWN or LEFT.\nIf he moves LEFT to `(0, 9)`, he is safe.\nIf he moves DOWN to `(1, 8)`, he is safe.\n\n**ANALYZING ME:**\nHead at `(0, 6)`.\nBody at `[(1, 6), (1, 7)]`.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Check:** My body is at `(1, 7)` and `(1, 6)`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(0, 7)` is currently empty (my body is at `x=1`).\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 5):**\n    *   **Check:** Is it an apple? YES! `(0, 5)` is an apple in the list.\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE & HIGH VALUE.** Eating an apple increases my score to 3 (tying the enemy) and makes me grow.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 6):**\n    *   **Check:** Off the board.\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Check:** My body is at `(1, 6)`.\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80 (Hitting myself).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe have two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n*   Moving **UP to (0, 7)** keeps me on the left wall. It doesn't gain immediate points. It keeps me safe for now, but the apple at `(0, 5)` is below me. I need to go DOWN eventually to get it.\n*   Moving **DOWN to (0, 5)** eats the apple. This ties the score 3-3. Crucially, *growing* adds a segment to my tail. This makes my body longer, which is good for defense and controlling space.\n\n**THE KILL ZONE CALCULATION:**\nIf I move **DOWN to (0, 5)**, I eat the apple.\nMy body will extend. My tail currently at `(1, 7)` won't move this turn (because I ate).\nNext turn, my head will be at `(0, 5)`. My body will be `[(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7)]`.\nThe enemy is at `(1, 9)`. Even if he moves DOWN twice, he's nowhere near me.\n\nIf I move **UP to (0, 7)**, I am safe, but I'm ignoring a free apple right below me.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nWhy wait? I need to close the apple gap. The enemy is trapped in the top corner, unable to threaten me immediately. I should secure the point, tie the score, and grow my body to dominate the board. The apple at `(0, 5)` is the immediate target.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN** to `(0, 5)` to eat the apple. Score becomes 3-3. Body grows.\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT** is invalid. **DOWN** to `(0, 4)` (there's another apple there!). Or **RIGHT** to `(1, 5)` if blocked. But looking at the map, `(0, 4)` is also an apple!\n3.  **Long Term:** Trap the enemy in the top-right corner. Keep the left wall clear.\n\nLet's get this bread. \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We're on Turn 14, and things are heating up!\n\n**THE VIBE CHECK:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(0, 5)`, Body at `[(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7)]`, Apples: 3. (Just ate the apple at `(0, 5)` last turn, right?)\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(0, 9)`, Body at `[(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]`, Apples: 3.\n*   **The Board:** We are on the left wall. The enemy is on the left wall *above* us, but separated by a gap.\n\n**ANALYZING THE ENEMY'S MOVES:**\nSnake #0 is at `(0, 9)`. Where can they go?\n1.  **LEFT (`-1, 9`):** Off the board. Suicide. Enemy dies.\n2.  **UP (`0, 10`):** Off the board. Suicide. Enemy dies.\n3.  **RIGHT (`1, 9`):** Blocked by their own body (segment at `(1, 9)`). Suicide. Enemy dies.\n4.  **DOWN (`0, 8`):** This is the *only* safe move for the enemy. The map shows `(0, 8)` is empty.\n\n**Conclusion:** The enemy *must* move **DOWN** to `(0, 8)` or they die instantly. If they are smart, they will move down.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES (Head at `0, 5`):**\n1.  **UP (`0, 6`):**\n    *   **Check:** My body segment is at `(0, 6)`.\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH.** I hit myself. Don't do it.\n2.  **LEFT (`-1, 5`):**\n    *   **Check:** Off the board.\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH.**\n3.  **RIGHT (`1, 5`):**\n    *   **Check:** Is it occupied? The map shows `.` at `(1, 5)`. My body is at `(1, 6)` and `(1, 7)`. The enemy is at `(0, 9)`.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n4.  **DOWN (`0, 4`):**\n    *   **Check:** The map shows an apple `A` at `(0, 4)`. Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE & TASTY.**\n\n**THE KILL ZONE CALCULATION:**\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(0, 4)`, I eat the apple (score becomes 4-3).\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to `(0, 8)`, we will be two squares apart: Enemy at `(0, 8)`, Me at `(0, 4)`.\nNext turn, I could potentially move to `(0, 3)` (apple there too!) or `(1, 4)`. The enemy will be forced to keep going down or die. Eventually, I can trap them against my tail or the wall.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to `(1, 5)`, I don't gain a point. I move away from the apple stack at `(0, 4)`, `(0, 3)`, etc. This gives the enemy more time to maneuver.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe enemy is trapped on the wall. I am safe to move **DOWN**. Taking the apple at `(0, 4)` increases my lead and stretches my body, potentially blocking the enemy's path down the wall. This is the aggressive play. We want to box him in!\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAssuming I eat the apple at `(0, 4)` and the enemy moves to `(0, 8)`:\n*   My head will be at `(0, 4)`.\n*   Enemy head at `(0, 8)`.\n*   My tail is currently at `(1, 7)`.\n*   I will look to eat the apple at `(0, 3)` next, or move to `(1, 4)` to start encircling.\n\nLet's secure the point and pressure the rat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

However, look at the board!\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to `(1, 4)`, I am moving *away* from the enemy and the tight wall corridor. I open up the center of the board. I can access the apple at `(2, 2)` or `(4, 1)` next. This keeps my options WIDE OPEN. I don't want to get trapped on the wall.\n*   If I move **DOWN** to `(0, 3)`, I am going deeper into the corner. While there is an apple at `(0, 0)` eventually, that path is a potential death trap if the enemy decides to block me later. It limits my escape routes.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm leading 4-3. I don't need to greedily chase apples on the wall right now. I need to expand my territory and control the center. Moving **RIGHT** to `(1, 4)` is the power move. It keeps me alive, keeps my future moves flexible, and prepares me to dominate the board.\n\nLet's secure the position and wait for the enemy to make a mistake. CHAT, IF HE CRASHES INTO ME, HE'S GONNA LOOK STUPID ON STREAM! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nControl the center. Force the enemy into the walls.

The map shows `.` at `(2, 4)`.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to `(1, 3)` brings me closer to the apples at `(2, 2)` and `(4, 1)`, but also brings me closer to the bottom edge. It's a decent option but might limit my vertical movement later.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)` pushes me deeper into the center. This is usually good for board control, but look at the board\u2014there are no apples immediately accessible in that direction without taking multiple steps.\n*   Moving **UP** to `(1, 5)` is interesting. It moves me directly toward the enemy's territory at `(1, 8)`. However, it also keeps me aligned with potential apples in the upper middle (like `(5, 5)`). Crucially, looking at the board, `(1, 5)` is currently empty.\n\nWait, let's look closer. The enemy is at `(1, 8)`. If I go UP to `(1, 5)`, I'm closing the distance. Is that smart?\nActually, looking at the board state provided, the enemy is at `(1, 8)`. If he moves DOWN to `(1, 7)`, he's getting closer. If I move UP to `(1, 5)`, we are on a collision course.\nBUT, look at the board. The space around `(1, 5)` is open. `T` at `(0, 5)` and `T` at `(1, 6)` (my body).\nIf I go UP to `(1, 5)`, I am sandwiched between my own body at `(1, 6)` and the enemy potentially coming down.\nActually, `(1, 6)` is MY body.\nSo if I go UP to `(1, 5)`, my tail moves from `(0, 4)` to `(0, 5)` (assuming I don't eat an apple).\nMy head is at `(1, 5)`.\nMy body is `[(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]`... wait, no.\nLet's trace the body.\nCurrent Head: `(1, 4)`\nCurrent Body: `[(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)]`\nIf I move UP to `(1, 5)`:\nNew Head: `(1, 5)`\nNew Body: `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]` (Tail `(1, 6)` drops off).\nIs `(1, 5)` safe? Yes, currently empty.\nIs `(1, 5)` safe from Enemy?\nEnemy is at `(1, 8)`. If he moves DOWN to `(1, 7)`, he doesn't hit me.\nIf he moves DOWN again later, he hits `(1, 6)` (which is currently my body, but will be gone next turn... wait, `(1, 6)` is my tail).\nIf I move UP to `(1, 5)`, my body becomes `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`.\nThe cell `(1, 6)` becomes empty.\nSo if the enemy moves DOWN to `(1, 7)` this turn, and I move UP to `(1, 5)`, we are safe.\nNext turn, if he moves DOWN to `(1, 6)`, he hits nothing (it's empty).\nIf I am at `(1, 5)`, and he is at `(1, 6)`, that's head-to-head? No, he is at `(1, 6)`, I am at `(1, 5)`.\nIf he moves to `(1, 5)` and I move to `(1, 6)`, we crash.\nBut generally, moving UP towards a potential enemy seems risky.\nHowever, look at the board.\nThere are apples at `(5, 5)`, `(3, 2)`, `(8, 1)`.\nMoving UP keeps me in the middle-lower section.\nMoving RIGHT to `(2, 4)` opens up the path to `(5, 5)`.\nMoving DOWN to `(1, 3)` opens up the path to `(2, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.\n\nLet's reconsider the **RIGHT** move to `(2, 4)`.\nCurrent Body: `[(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)]`.\nIf I move RIGHT to `(2, 4)`:\nNew Head: `(2, 4)`\nNew Body: `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`.\nIs `(2, 4)` safe? Yes.\nIs it smart? It moves me toward `(5, 5)` and `(4, 1)`.\nThe enemy is at `(1, 8)`. He is far away vertically.\nMoving RIGHT gives me access to the right side of the board.\nMoving UP keeps me pinned against the left wall essentially.\nMoving DOWN pushes me to the bottom.\n\nLet's look at the **DOWN** move to `(1, 3)`.\nNew Head: `(1, 3)`\nNew Body: `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`.\nIs `(1, 3)` safe? Yes.\nThis moves me closer to `(2, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.\nHowever, `(1, 3)` is very close to `(0, 3)` which is a `T` (wall? no, `(0,3)` is empty on the board map provided in the prompt?).\nWait, the map provided in the prompt says:\n```\n 3 . . . . . A . . A .\n```\nSo `(0, 3)` is `.` (empty).\nSo `(1, 3)` is safe.\nBut `(1, 3)` is very close to the left wall.\nIf I go DOWN to `(1, 3)`, I am vulnerable to being trapped against the bottom or left wall.\nIf I go RIGHT to `(2, 4)`, I am moving into the open board.\nIf I go UP to `(1, 5)`, I am moving towards the enemy, but also keeping my vertical options open.\n\nWait, looking at the board provided in the prompt:\n```\n 9 T T . . . . . . . .\n 8 T 0 . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . A . . .\n 6 T T . . . . . . . .\n 5 T . . . . A . . . .\n 4 T 1 . . . . . .

No, the text block shows rows 9 down to 0).\nRow 3 in the text block is:\n` 3 . . . . . A . .

Snake #0 is at `(1, 8)`.\nHis body is `[(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]`.\nIf I move UP to `(1, 5)`, I am moving into his vertical column.\nHe is at `(1, 8)`.\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes to `(1, 7)`.\nIf I stay at `(1, 5)`, we have `(1, 6)` between us (currently my body, but will be empty next turn if I don't eat).\nActually, if I move UP to `(1, 5)`, my body becomes `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`.\nThe cell `(1, 6)` becomes EMPTY.\nSo the enemy at `(1, 8)` can move to `(1, 7)` and then `(1, 6)` safely.\nIf he moves to `(1, 6)` and I move to `(1, 7)` (Up again), we are head to head if we swap? No, if he is at `(1, 6)` and I am at `(1, 5)`, we are neighbors.\nIf he moves to `(1, 5)` and I am at `(1, 5)`, we crash.\nThis is risky. Being on the same vertical line as the enemy invites a head-on collision or a trap.\n\nConsider **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)`.\nI move out of his column.\nI move towards the center.\nI open up access to `(5, 5)` and `(4, 1)`.\nThe cell `(2, 4)` is currently `.`.\nIs it safe?\nMy body moves to `[(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`.\nThe enemy is at `(1, 8)`. He can't reach me this turn.\nSo **RIGHT** is safe.\n\nConsider **DOWN** to `(1, 3)`.\nI move to `(1, 3)`.\nThis is close to the bottom wall.\nBut `(2, 2)` and `(4, 1)` are apples.\nThe apple at `(4, 1)` is particularly attractive because it's on the edge but accessible.\nHowever, moving DOWN limits my \"upward\" mobility in the long run if the enemy pushes down.\n\nLet's compare the \"Future Options\" for **RIGHT** vs **DOWN**.\n**RIGHT** to `(2, 4)`:\n- Can go to `(3, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 5)`.\n- Targets: `(5, 5)`, `(4, 1)`, `(3, 2)`.\n- Open space: High.\n\n**DOWN** to `(1, 3)`:\n- Can go to `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`.\n- Targets: `(2, 2)`, `(4, 1)`.\n- Open space: Lower (constrained by x=0 wall and y=0 wall).\n\n**UP** to `(1, 5)`:\n- Can go to `(1, 6)`, `(2, 5)`.\n- Targets: `(5, 5)` (indirectly).\n- Conflict Risk: High (Enemy at `(1, 8)`).\n\nGiven the instruction \"Focus on where the enemy is\" and \"Be aggressive\", but also \"avoid getting boxed in\".\nThe enemy is high up at `(1, 8)`.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am expanding away from him.\nIf I go UP, I am moving toward him.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away from him.\n\nWhy would I move toward him?\nOnly if I want to block him or force a collision.\nI have 4 apples, he has 3.\nIf I force a head-on collision, I win (I have more apples).\nBUT, head-on collision requires both heads to meet in the same cell *next turn* or at the same time.\nCurrently, distance is 4 units (`(1, 4)` to `(1, 8)`).\nIf I go UP to `(1, 5)`, distance becomes 3 units.\nIf he goes DOWN to `(1, 7)`, distance is 2 units.\nIf I go UP to `(1, 6)` (next turn), and he goes DOWN to `(1, 6)` (next turn), we crash.\nBUT, if I am at `(1, 5)` and he is at `(1, 7)`, and I move UP and he moves DOWN, we pass each other? No, simultaneous movement.\nIf I am at `(1, 5)` and he is at `(1, 7)`.\nI move UP to `(1, 6)`.\nHe moves DOWN to `(1, 6)`.\nWe both occupy `(1, 6)` -> **DOUBLE DEATH**.\nThis is bad for me because I am winning. I don't want to tie/draw. I want to win.\nSo I should **AVOID** head-on collisions unless I can guarantee he dies and I live (e.g., he hits my body).\nSo moving UP is bad because it invites a double-death scenario where I lose my lead.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is **NOT** the play.\nThe play is between **RIGHT** and **DOWN**.\n\n**RIGHT** to `(2, 4)`:\n- Moves me to the center.\n- Opens up the board.\n- Chases the apple at `(5, 5)` and `(4, 1)`.\n\n**DOWN** to `(1, 3)`:\n- Moves me closer to `(2, 2)` and `(4, 1)`.\n- `(4, 1)` is an apple.\n- `(2, 2)` is an apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at `(4, 1)`.\nFrom `(1, 4)`: Distance is `|4-1| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6`.\nFrom `(2, 4)`: Distance is `|4-2| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5`.\nFrom `(1, 3)`: Distance is `|4-1| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n\nLet's look at the apple at `(2, 2)`.\nFrom `(1, 4)`: Distance is `|2-1| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3`.\nFrom `(2, 4)`: Distance is `|2-2| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2`.\nFrom `(1, 3)`: Distance is `|2-1| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nLet's look at the apple at `(5, 5)`.\nFrom `(1, 4)`: Distance is `|5-1| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5`.\nFrom `(2, 4)`: Distance is `|5-2| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nFrom `(1, 3)`: Distance is `|5-1| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6`.\n\n**RIGHT** seems to optimize the path to `(5, 5)` and `(2, 2)` (effectively equal to DOWN for `(2, 2)`).\n**DOWN** optimizes `(2, 2)` (slightly) and `(4, 1)` (equal to RIGHT).\n**RIGHT** gives better access to the center of the board.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(1, 3)`, I am entering the bottom-left quadrant.\nIf the enemy decides to come down (unlikely immediately, but possible), I might get squeezed.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)`, I am in the \"Mid-Right\" sector.\nThe enemy is in the \"Top-Left\" sector.\nThere is plenty of space.\n\nLet's check safety of `(2, 4)` again.\nMy body is `[(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)]`.\n`(2, 4)` is `.`.\nIs there any threat?\nSnake #0 is at `(1, 8)`. He can't reach `(2, 4)` this turn.\nIs there an apple at `(2, 4)`? No.\nSo I just move.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer **DOWN**?\nThe apple at `(4, 1)` is valuable.\nBut `(5, 5)` is also valuable.\n`(5, 5)` is more central.\n`(4, 1)` is on the edge.\nBeing on the edge is dangerous (boxed in).\nBeing in the center is safer.\n\nSo, **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)` is the \"Control the Center\" play.\n**DOWN** to `(1, 3)` is the \"Edge Hunter\" play.\n\nGiven the instruction \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at `(1, 8)`.\nI want to dominate the board.\nDominating the board means controlling the space.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am claiming the middle-right area.\nIf I go DOWN, I am claiming the bottom-left area.\nThe bottom-left area is smaller (bounded by walls).\nThe middle-right area connects to everything.\n\nAlso, look at the board state provided in the prompt (the visual map).\nRow 4: `4 T 1 . . . . . . A .`\nWait, the text map shows:\n` 4 T 1 . . . . . . A .`\nThis corresponds to y=4.\nAt x=0: T (My body?

The map shows `1` at `(1, 4)`.\nMy Body:\n`(0, 4)` -> Map shows `T` at `(0, 4)`.\n`(0, 5)` -> Map shows `T` at `(0, 5)` (Row 5, Col 0). Correct.\n`(0, 6)` -> Map shows `T` at `(0, 6)` (Row 6, Col 0). Correct.\n`(1, 6)` -> Map shows `T` at `(1, 6)` (Row 6, Col 1). Correct.\nSo the map matches my body.\n\nEnemy Head: `(1, 8)`. Map shows `0` at `(1, 8)`.

Correct.\n`(1, 9)` -> Map shows `T` at `(1, 9)` (Row 9, Col 1). Correct.\n\nSo the map is accurate.\n\nLet's re-evaluate **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)`.\nMap at `(2, 4)` is `.` (Row 4, Col 2). Correct.\nThis is safe.\nLet's re-evaluate **DOWN** to `(1, 3)`.\nMap at `(1, 3)` is `.` (Row 3, Col 1). Correct.\nThis is safe.\nLet's re-evaluate **UP** to `(1, 5)`.\nMap at `(1, 5)` is `.` (Row 5, Col 1). Correct.\nThis is safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Safety from Enemy:** Moving RIGHT takes me off the enemy's vertical line (x=1). This avoids potential head-on collision scenarios in the future. The enemy is at (1, 8). If I stay on x=1, he can chase me down or trap me against the left wall. By moving to x=2, I force him to deviate to attack me.\n2.  **Board Control:** (2, 4) is a central position. It allows access to (5, 5), (4, 1), and (2, 2). It keeps options open.\n3.  **Avoiding Traps:** Moving DOWN to (1, 3) puts me closer to the bottom wall (y=0) and left wall (x=0). While not immediately dangerous, it reduces long-term maneuverability. Moving RIGHT increases it.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nTarget the apple at (5, 5) or (2, 2) depending on enemy movement. Maintain distance from the enemy.\n\n**Final Check:**\nIs there any hidden danger at (2, 4)?\nNo. It's empty.\nIs there any reason to go DOWN?\nOnly to get the apple at (4, 1) faster. But I can get it from (2, 4) as well.\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nNo. It's risky.\n\nSo, I'm going RIGHT.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"RIGHT\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) is the best play. It keeps me safe from the enemy at (1, 8) by breaking the vertical alignment, avoiding potential head-on collisions. It moves me into the center of the board, opening up paths to multiple apples ((5, 5), (2, 2), (4, 1)) and maximizing my future movement options. Moving DOWN or UP would keep me aligned with walls or the enemy, reducing flexibility.\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the instructions say \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I should output the reasoning followed by the word.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\n`RIGHT` increases X.\nCurrent: (1, 4).\nTarget: (2, 4).\nCorrect.\n\nLet's double check the apples.\nApple at (5, 5) is `A` at row 5, col 5. Yes.\nApple at (2, 2) is `A` at row 2, col 2. Yes.\nApple at (4, 1) is `A` at row 1, col 4. Yes.\n\nLet's check the enemy's potential moves.\nEnemy at (1, 8).\nPossible moves:\n- Down to (1, 7).

If he moves DOWN again to `(1, 6)` or RIGHT to `(2, 7)`, I'm safe.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward the apple at `(5, 5)`. Keeps me in the center lane.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \u2705\n\n2.  **DOWN (`2, 3`):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **Pros:** Closer to `(3, 2)` and `(4, 1)` apples.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves me further from the central apple at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \u2705\n\n3.  **LEFT (`1, 4`):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **BUT WAIT:** My previous body segment was at `(1, 4)`. Since I moved from `(1, 4)` to `(2, 4)` last turn, my tail moved to `(0, 4)`.\n    *   However, the enemy is at `(1, 7)`.\n    *   If I move LEFT to `(1, 4)`, I am back on the enemy's vertical line (`x=1`).\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to `(1, 6)`, we are close. If he moves DOWN to `(1, 5)` and I move UP next turn, we crash.\n    *   Moving back to `x=1` aligns me with the enemy. This is risky.\n    *   **Verdict:** DANGEROUS TERRITORY. \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT (`3, 4`):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the path to `(5, 5)` and `(8, 4)`.\n    *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n*   **LEFT** is bad because it puts me back on the enemy's line (`x=1`). Since I'm winning (4 vs 3 apples), I should avoid the line of fire.\n*   **DOWN** brings me closer to the bottom wall and the smaller apples, but risks trapping me later.\n*   **RIGHT** and **UP** are the best power moves.\n    *   **UP** to `(2, 5)` is solid. It takes a step toward `(5, 5)`.\n    *   **RIGHT** to `(3, 4)` is also solid. It pushes deeper into the open board.\n\nLet's look at the geometry. I'm at `(2, 4)`. The apple at `(5, 5)` is 3 steps away (Right, Right, Up). The apple at `(3, 2)` is 2 steps away (Left, Down).\nIf I go **UP** to `(2, 5)`, I am one step closer to `(5, 5)`.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(3, 4)`, I am also one step closer to `(5, 5)`.\nHowever, **UP** to `(2, 5)` creates a more flexible position. From `(2, 5)`, I can go Left (back towards safety), Right (towards center), or Up (towards the apple).\nFrom `(3, 4)`, I am slightly more committed to the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at `(1, 7)`. He is moving toward the apple at `(1, 6)` (empty) or `(1, 5)` (empty). If he takes the apple, he grows. If I stay on the `x=1` line, I risk collision. Moving to `x=2` or `x=3` is safer.\nSince I moved to `x=2` last turn, staying on `x=2` (moving UP) is safe. The enemy is at `x=1`.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI will move **UP**. This keeps me in the center lane, moves toward the medium apple at `(5, 5)`, and avoids aligning with the enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure `(5, 5)` apple. Force enemy to the edges. Maintain distance.\n\nUP",

Time to execute the plan and box this enemy snake out!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** `(2, 5)`\n- **My Body:** `[(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)]`\n- **Enemy Head:** `(2, 7)` (Wait, looking at the board... let me check the board data again)\n- **Board Layout:**\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 T T . . . . . . . .\n 7 .

A A\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy snake #0 is actually at `(2, 7)` with body at `[(1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8)]`. This is interesting - he's right above me at x=2!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to `(2, 6)`**: \n   - SAFETY CHECK: Empty on board (`.`)\n   - ENEMY: Enemy head at `(2, 7)` - if we both move UP, he goes to `(2, 8)` and we go to `(2, 6)` - NO collision!\n   - STRATEGIC: Gets me closer to the apple at `(5, 5)` and keeps me in the center\n   - VERDICT: SAFE \u2705\n\n2. **DOWN to `(2, 4)`**: \n   - **DEADLY!** That's my current body position! I'd be eating my own tail segment.\n   - VERDICT: DEATH \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to `(1, 5)`**:\n   - SAFETY CHECK: Empty on board (`.`)\n   - ENEMY: Enemy is at x=2, y=7. If he moves DOWN to (2,6) or LEFT to (1,7), we might intersect.\n   - If he moves DOWN to (2,6) and I move LEFT to (1,5) - we're diagonal, safe!\n   - If he moves LEFT to (1,7) and I move LEFT to (1,5) - we're separated by one segment, safe!\n   - BUT: This puts me back on x=1, his vertical line. Risky long-term.\n   - VERDICT: MARGINALLY SAFE BUT RISKY \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n4. **RIGHT to `(3, 5)`**:\n   - SAFETY CHECK: Empty on board (`.`)\n   - ENEMY: Enemy at (2,7). If he moves RIGHT to (3,7) or DOWN to (2,6), safe distance.\n   - STRATEGIC: Opens path to center apples (5,5) and avoids his vertical line.\n   - VERDICT: SAFE \u2705\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm at `(2, 5)` with enemy directly above at `(2, 7)`! This is a narrow corridor but I see the play.\n\n**UP is the move!** Why?\n- I'm at 4 apples, enemy at 3. I have the score advantage to force aggression.\n- If I go UP to `(2, 6)`, I'm challenging his space directly above him.\n- If he goes UP to `(2, 8)` (toward the top edge), I gain position.\n- If he goes DOWN to `(2, 6)`... wait, that would be a head-on collision at `(2, 6)`! But I'm not sure he'll do that since he's at 3 apples vs my 4.\n- The apple at `(5, 5)` is still calling from the right, but this positioning move is more important right now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider... Looking at the board more carefully, moving RIGHT to `(3, 5)` might be safer because:\n- It avoids the direct vertical confrontation\n- Opens up the right side for apple collection\n- Keeps multiple escape routes open\n\nBut wait - the enemy is at `(2, 7)`. If I go UP to `(2, 6)`, I'm right below him. If he goes DOWN to `(2, 6)`, we collide and he dies (since I have more apples)! That's a winning play if he's not paying attention.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **UP** to `(2, 6)` to pressure the enemy and potentially force a collision. With 4 vs 3 apples, I can afford to be aggressive. If he moves into me, he loses. If he moves away, I gain board control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nPressure the enemy vertically, force him to the edges, then swing right to collect the center apples. Maintain score lead and look for head-on collision opportunities.\n\nUP",

Time to keep this W streak going! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** `(1, 6)` (Just moved LEFT to safety)\n- **My Body:** `[(2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4)]` - Solid line, keeping distance\n- **Enemy Head:** `(4, 7)` - Still at the top, body at `(3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)`\n- **Score:** Me: 4 apples, Enemy: 3 apples (Lead maintained! \ud83d\udcc8)\n- **Board Status:** That apple at `(5, 5)` is calling my name, and there's another at `(3, 2)` waiting in the center!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to `(1, 7)`**: \n   - **DEADLY!** Enemy body is at `(1, 7)`! Snake #0's tail is literally there. Can't step on his body! \u274c\n   - Even though it's the tail, it's still occupied. RIP if I go there.\n\n2. **DOWN to `(1, 5)`**: \n   - **DEADLY!** Wait, let me check... `(1, 5)` shows as empty (`.`) on the board!\n   - But hold up - is that my neck? No, my neck is at `(2, 6)`. \n   - **RISKY THOUGH:** If enemy moves DOWN to `(4, 6)` and then I go DOWN... actually we'd be diagonal. \n   - Enemy could also move DOWN to `(4, 6)` and attack... but wait, that's not where I'd be.\n   - Actually `(1, 5)` is **SAFE** on board, but need to check enemy's possible moves. He's at `(4, 7)`, can move DOWN to `(4, 6)` or LEFT to `(3, 7)`.\n   - If I go DOWN and he goes DOWN to `(4, 6)`, no collision. If he goes LEFT to `(3, 7)`, still no collision.\n   - **VERDICT:** Possibly safe, but let's see other options. \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT to `(0, 6)`**:\n   - **DEADLY!** Wait... `(0, 6)` shows as empty on board!\n   - **BOOM!** Let me double-check the board state.\n   - Row 6 (y=6): `. 1 T . . . . . . .`\n   - So at `(0, 6)` there's `.` = EMPTY!\n   - **STRATEGIC:** Moving to the left edge! Gets me to the boundary, but also...\n   - Actually wait, looking at my body: `(1, 4)` is my tail. If I go LEFT to `(0, 6)`, I'm moving further from my body which is at x=1-2. This is **SAFE** from self-collision.\n   - **RISK:** If enemy moves DOWN to `(4, 6)` and LEFT? No, he's at x=4.\n   - **VERDICT:** **SAFE!** \u2705 And it gets me to the edge where I can control the board better.\n\n4. **RIGHT to `(2, 6)`**:\n   - **DEADLY!** That's literally my neck! My head is at `(1, 6)`, my body starts at `(2, 6)`. Moving backwards into my own body = instant death! \u274c\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nI have **TWO safe moves**: DOWN to `(1, 5)` or LEFT to `(0, 6)`.\n\n**LEFT to `(0, 6)`** is the **SUPERIOR PLAY** here's why:\n\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** Guaranteed empty space, and I'm moving AWAY from the enemy's body at `(1, 7)`. Zero collision risk.\n2. **BOARD CONTROL:** Hitting the left edge gives me a boundary to work with. I can now turn downward or upward along the edge, forcing the enemy into the center.\n3. **APPLE ACCESS:** From `(0, 6)`, I can access apples at `(2, 1)`, `(3, 2)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 3)` etc. The path opens up.\n4. **ENEMY TRAP:** The enemy is at `(4, 7)` with body extending left to `(1, 7)`. By going to the left edge, I can potentially circle around and box him in against the top-right corner.\n5. **DISTANCE:** I'm keeping distance from the enemy while maintaining my lead (4 vs 3). I don't need to be reckless - I'm ahead!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**LEFT** to `(0, 6)` - claiming the edge, controlling space, staying safe. The apple at `(5, 5)` will be there for me when I'm ready. Let the enemy make the first mistake!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nFrom `(0, 6)`, I'll have options: DOWN to `(0, 5)` (edge path), or maybe swing right to `(1, 6)` if safe. My goal is to get to those center apples at `(3, 2)` and `(5, 5)` while maintaining the score lead. Stay patient, stay alive, and when the score gap widens, go for the aggressive kill!\n\nChat, if this play works, we're making content! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLEFT",

He's getting closer to the right side.\n- **Enemy Body:** `[(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)]` - Still holding that line.\n- **Score:** **ME: 4, ENEMY: 4** - TIED! \ud83d\ude21 No lead anymore! Time to get aggressive!\n\n**BOARD AWARENESS:**\nLooking at the board, I see apples everywhere, but I'm ignoring them. My focus is **ENEMY TERMINATION**. He's at `(6, 7)` on the top-right side. I'm at `(0, 5)` on the bottom-left. We're on opposite sides of the board.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to `(0, 6)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 6 (y=6): `T T T . . . . . . .`\n   - At `(0, 6)` there's `T` = **MY BODY!** \u274c DEAD. I can't move into my own neck.\n\n2. **DOWN to `(0, 4)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 4 (y=4): `. . . . . . . . A .`\n   - At `(0, 4)` there's `.` = **EMPTY!** \u2705\n   - **EDGE CONTROL:** Continuing down the left edge is solid.\n   - **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From `(0, 4)`, I can continue DOWN to `(0, 3)`, `(0, 2)`, etc., or swing RIGHT.\n   - **RISK:** Enemy is far away, no immediate threat.\n   - **VERDICT:** Safe, but I'm just running down the edge.\n\n3. **LEFT to `(-1, 5)`**: \n   - **DEADLY!** Off the board! \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to `(1, 5)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 5 (y=5): `. . T . . A . . . .`\n   - At `(1, 5)` there's `.` = **EMPTY!** \u2705\n   - **STRATEGIC SHIFT:** Moving RIGHT toward the center!\n   - **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From `(1, 5)`, I can go UP to `(1, 6)` (but that's my body! \u274c), DOWN to `(1, 4)`, or RIGHT to `(2, 5)`.\n   - **RISK:** If I go RIGHT to `(2, 5)` next, I need to check `[(2, 6), (2, 5)]` - `(2, 5)` is my tail! So `(2, 5)` is **NOT EMPTY**. From `(1, 5)`, I can go DOWN to `(1, 4)` safely (check: `(1, 4)` is `. . . . . . . . A .` at y=4, so `(1, 4)` is `.` = EMPTY). Then from `(1, 4)`, I can go DOWN to `(1, 3)`, RIGHT to `(2, 4)`, or LEFT to `(0, 4)`. All are safe.\n   - **STRATEGIC VALUE:** From `(1, 5)`, I'm closer to the center and can cut off the enemy if he moves down toward the apples at `(5, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, etc.\n   - **AGGRESSION:** TIED SCORE! I need to pressure him. Moving toward the center puts me in a position to intercept his path if he goes for the center apples.\n   - **VERDICT:** **THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** \u2705\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nI have **TWO safe moves**: DOWN to `(0, 4)` or RIGHT to `(1, 5)`.\n\n**RIGHT to `(1, 5)` is the WINNING MOVE!**\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **TIED SCORE - NEED PRESSURE!** We're tied 4-4. I can't just run down the edge anymore. I need to position myself to potentially force a head-on collision or cut him off.\n2. **CENTER ACCESS:** From `(1, 5)`, I can pivot toward the apple cluster at `(2, 1)`, `(3, 2)`, `(4, 1)`. If I go DOWN to `(0, 4)` I'm stuck on the left side.\n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at `(6, 7)` might go DOWN to `(6, 6)` or `(6, 5)` to chase apples. If I'm at `(1, 5)`, I can react accordingly.\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From `(1, 5)`, I have **TWO safe follow-up moves** that keep my path open: DOWN to `(1, 4)` (safe, as confirmed) or RIGHT to `(2, 5)` is DEAD (my body), so only DOWN is safe from `(1, 5)`. Wait, let me re-check: from `(1, 5)`, if I go DOWN to `(1, 4)`, from there I can go DOWN to `(1, 3)` (empty), RIGHT to `(2, 4)` (empty? Let me check: at `(2, 4)` row 4: `. . . . . . . . A .` so `(2, 4)` is `.` = empty \u2705), LEFT to `(0, 4)` (empty), or UP back to `(1, 5)`. So yes, from `(1, 5)`, going DOWN to `(1, 4)` gives me 3 safe options. That's good flexibility!\n5. **AGGRESSION:** Moving toward the center shows the enemy I'm not afraid. He's at `(6, 7)` - if he goes DOWN to `(6, 6)` and I go DOWN to `(1, 4)`, we're still far. But I'm positioning for future turns.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**RIGHT** to `(1, 5)` - shifting from pure edge control to **CENTER PRESSURE**. The enemy is tied with me, so I'm making a move to set up future aggressive plays. Time to hunt!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom `(1, 5)`, I'll go DOWN to `(1, 4)` next turn (safe path). Then I can either continue down toward the bottom apples or swing RIGHT to `(2, 4)` and then DOWN to cut off any enemy movement down the right side. The key is to stay flexible and keep options open while maintaining pressure on the enemy. I need to get that lead back! \ud83d\ude24\n\nChat, this is how champions think! We're not just playing snake, we're playing **MIND GAMES**! Let's go!\n\n**END THIS TURN RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT!** Turn 23 and the tension is ELECTRIC! \ud83d\udd25 We're tied 5-5 now, and I just grew to match the enemy! But wait... the scoreboard says I have 5 apples and he has 4? Let me check the logic. The prompt says \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 5\" and \"Snake #0 apples: 4\", but then \"SCOREBOARD: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 5 LET'S GOOO! - Snake #0 apples: 4\". And the board shows an apple at (4, 2) which I probably ate. So I'm leading 5-4! Actually, re-reading: \"SCOREBOARD: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 5 LET'S GOOO! - Snake #0 apples: 4\". So I'm up by one! But the turn summary says \"Turn: 23 / 150\" and \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" was RIGHT. Wait, the replay shows last move was RIGHT, and my head is at (1,5). That means I moved from (0,5) to (1,5) last turn. But the board shows my head at (1,5) now? Actually, the current state says \"Head: (1, 5)\" for me. That means I'm at (1,5) now. But I need to decide my next move from (1,5).\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **My Head:** `(1, 5)` - Just moved here from (0,5) last turn.\n- **My Body:** `[(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5)]` - This is HEAD-TO-TAIL, so the tail is (2,5). My previous head (0,5) is now part of my body.\n- **Enemy Head:** `(6, 6)` - Wait, the opponent description says \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 6)\" but earlier it said he was at (6,7)? Let me check: \"OPPONENTS: * Snake #0 - Head: (6, 6), Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)], Apples: 4\". So enemy head is at (6,6) now, and his body includes (6,7) which is above him. That means he moved DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) last turn.\n- **Enemy Body:** `[(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]` - He's still in a vertical line on the right side.\n- **Score:** **ME: 5, ENEMY: 4** - I'M LEADING! \ud83d\ude24 Time to defend and maybe go for the kill if I can force a head-on collision.\n\n**BOARD AWARENESS:**\nI'm at (1,5). The board shows apples everywhere, but I'm hunting the enemy. He's at (6,6). We're getting closer! I need to consider my moves carefully.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS from (1,5):**\n\n1. **UP to `(1, 6)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 6 (y=6): From the board: `9 . . . . . . . . . .` wait, let me read the board properly. The board is given as:\n     ```\n     9 . . . . . . . . . .\n     8 . . . . . . . . . .\n     7 . A . T T T T . . .\n     6 T T T . . . 0 . . .\n     5 T 1 T . . A . . . .\n     4 . . . . . . . . A .\n     3 . . . . . A . . A .\n     2 . A . A A . . . . A\n     1 . . A . A . A . A A\n     0 A . . . . . . . . .\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n     ```\n     At y=6, x=1: The row shows \"T T T . . . 0 . . .\" So (1,6) is the second character: 'T' = **MY BODY!** \u274c DEAD. Can't move into my own body.\n\n2. **DOWN to `(1, 4)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 4 (y=4): `. . . . . . . . A .` At x=1: second character is '.' = **EMPTY!** \u2705\n   - **SAFE?** Yes.\n   - **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (1,4), I can go DOWN to (1,3) (check: row 3: `. . . . . A . . A .` x=1 is '.' = empty), LEFT to (0,4) (check: row 4 x=0 is '.'), or RIGHT to (2,4) (row 4 x=2 is '.'). All seem safe.\n   - **STRATEGIC VALUE:** Moves me down toward the apple cluster at (2,1), (3,2), (4,1). But enemy is at (6,6). If I go down, I'm going away from him. Not aggressive enough.\n\n3. **LEFT to `(0, 5)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 5 (y=5): `T 1 T . . A . . . .` At x=0: first character is 'T' = **MY BODY!** \u274c DEAD. Actually, wait: (0,5) is where I was last turn, and now it's part of my body. So moving left into my own body is illegal. DEAD.\n\n4. **RIGHT to `(2, 5)`**: \n   - **CHECK:** Row 5 (y=5): `T 1 T . . A . . . .` At x=2: third character is 'T' = **MY BODY!** \u274c DEAD. Because (2,5) is in my body list: `[(0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]` - yes, (2,5) is the tail! So moving right into my own tail is illegal (backwards movement). DEAD.\n\nSo from (1,5), the ONLY safe move is DOWN to (1,4). All other moves are into my own body or off-board.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nI have **ONE safe move**: DOWN to `(1,4)`.\n\n**WHY DOWN is the ONLY choice:**\n- UP hits my body at (1,6).\n- LEFT hits my body at (0,5).\n- RIGHT hits my body at (2,5).\n- DOWN is the only empty cell.\n\nBut is it strategically good? Let me think. The enemy is at (6,6). If I go DOWN to (1,4), I'm moving away from him. However, I have no choice. But maybe I can use this to my advantage. From (1,4), I can continue down or swing right. I need to plan my path to eventually cut off the enemy or force him into a trap.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN from (1,4):**\nFrom (1,4), I'll likely go DOWN to (1,3) next, then maybe RIGHT to (2,3) or (2,2) to head toward the apple cluster in the bottom-left/center. The enemy might be going for apples on the right side. I need to stay alive and eventually position myself to intercept his path. Since I'm leading 5-4, I can afford to play defensively but should still look for opportunities to grow and trap him.\n\n**AGGRESSION NOTE:** Even though I'm moving away from him now, I need to remember that he might come down toward me later. The board is getting crowded with apples, but my priority is survival and maintaining my lead. If I can grow without risking death, I should.\n\nSo the move is DOWN. No other option exists.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: DOWN**",

I'm leading 5-4, so I need to stay aggressive but smart. The board is getting spicy with all those apples, but I'm focused on the enemy\u2014he's the real threat. If I can trap him or force a head-on collision with my higher score, I win. But first, I need to survive this turn.\n\n**MOVES FROM (1,5):**\n- **UP to (1,6)**: Check the board\u2014(1,6) is part of my body! \u274c DEAD. Can't move into myself.\n- **LEFT to (0,5)**: Also my body! \u274c DEAD. That's where I came from last turn.\n- **RIGHT to (2,5)**: My tail! \u274c DEAD. Hitting myself is a no-go.\n- **DOWN to (1,4)**: The board shows (1,4) is empty! \u2705 SAFE. Only move left, but it's the right one.\n\n**WHY DOWN?**\nNo choice, but it's actually decent. From (1,4), I can head down toward the apple cluster at (2,1) or swing right to cut off the enemy's path later. He's on the right side, so I'm giving him space now, but I'll close in soon. My score lead means I can play a bit defensive, but I need to grow to dominate the board. I'll plan to snake right in the next few turns to pressure him.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (1,4), I'll go DOWN to (1,3) next if safe, then RIGHT toward (2,3) to get closer to the center and apples. Goal: grow to 6+ apples and position myself to box him in on the right side. Watch for head-on collisions\u2014if he comes toward me, I can force the crash with my lead.\n\nDOWN",

I'm at (1,3) with a body that's mostly on the left side, and he's at (5,5) on the right. We need to be AGGRESSIVE and force a head-on collision since we're tied\u2014no score advantage now, but if I can crash him into me or trap him, I win. The board is packed with apples, but I'm ignoring them; I need to control the center and cut off his escape routes.\n\nMy current head is at (1,3). Let's check all moves for safety:\n\n- **UP to (1,4)**: That's my own body! \u274c DEAD. Hitting myself.\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: Empty on the board. \u2705 SAFE. But it's moving left into a cornerish area with my tail nearby at (0,5)/(0,6).\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE. This moves me toward the center and apples, and gives me more room to maneuver.\n- **DOWN to (1,2)**: Empty! \u2705 SAFE. That's an apple location, but I'm ignoring apples for now\u2014focus on the enemy.\n\nAll moves except UP are safe. Now, which one gives me the best options for the next turns while pressuring Snake #0?\n\n- **DOWN to (1,2)**: Leads me straight into the apple cluster at (2,1)/(3,2). But if I go for apples, I might grow and give the enemy space to flank. Plus, from (1,2), I could box myself in if I'm not careful\u2014my body is blocking left and up. Not ideal for aggression.\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: This goes deeper into my own tail zone. From there, my only safe moves might be UP or DOWN along the edge, but that's where my body is. I could get trapped in a corner with no way out. The enemy is on the right; moving left is defensive, not aggressive. I need to close in, not retreat!\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: This is the play! \ud83d\ude80 It moves me toward the center (closer to the enemy at (5,5)), opens up paths to apples on the right (like (3,2), (4,1), (5,3)) while keeping multiple escape routes\u2014DOWN to (2,2), UP to (2,4), RIGHT to (3,3). From here, I can force the enemy toward me or cut off his path to apples on the left. If he heads left or up, I can intercept. With our scores tied, I want to create a head-on collision situation\u2014maybe bait him into moving into my body or meet him in the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (2,3), next turn I'll likely go RIGHT to (3,3) or DOWN to (2,2) depending on his move, aiming to snake around the center and trap him against my body or the edge. Goal: force a crash or grow to 6 apples while denying him space. Watch his head\u2014if he moves toward me, I can charge straight into him since we're tied, but only if I have an escape route.

My head is at (2,3) after moving RIGHT last turn. The board is cluttered with apples, but I\u2019m ignoring them\u2014my mission is to trap this rival and force a head-on crash. Since our scores are equal, a head-on collision ends in a draw, but if I can box him in or make him hit my body, I win. Let\u2019s analyze survival and aggression.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (2,3)\n- My body: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6)] \u2014 so my body covers (1,3) and left/down paths.\n- Enemy head: (5,4) \u2014 he moved RIGHT from (5,4) to (5,4)? Wait, the board shows him at (5,4) now, but last turn he was at (5,4)? Let\u2019s check: Last turn he was at (5,4) with body [(5,5), ...]. Now the board shows \"0\" at (5,4), so he\u2019s still there? Actually, the board state shows \"0\" at (5,4) on row 4. Hmm, did he move? Let\u2019s trust the board: he\u2019s at (5,4) with body behind. But simultaneous movement means we all move now. I need to predict his move. From (5,4), his options: UP (5,5) is his own body, DOWN (5,3) is empty (apple at (5,3)), LEFT (4,4) empty, RIGHT (6,4) empty. He might go for apple at (5,3) or spread out.\n\n**CHECK MY SAFE MOVES (ELIMINATE DEATH):**\n- **UP to (2,4)**: Check board\u2014row 4 col 2? The board shows row 4: \". T . . . 0 . . A .\" so (2,4) is \"T\"? Wait, row 4 is y=4? Let\u2019s map: y=0 bottom, y=9 top. So row 4 is y=4. At x=2, y=4, the board shows \"T\"? Actually row 4: \". T . . . 0 . . A .\" \u2014 positions: x=0 \".\", x=1 \"T\", x=2 \".\", x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \"0\", x=6 \".\", x=7 \".\", x=8 \"A\", x=9 \".\". So (2,4) is \".\" empty. Is it my body? My body is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), etc. (2,4) not in my body. So empty. \u2705 SAFE. But is it into enemy body? Enemy body is [(5,5),(6,5),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7)]\u2014no. So UP is safe. However, from (2,4), I have multiple exits: LEFT (1,4) is my own body! That\u2019s backwards? (1,4) is directly behind (2,4) if I came from (1,3)? Actually my head came from (1,3) to (2,3) last turn. So if I go UP to (2,4), then from there, LEFT to (1,4) would be into my own body (not immediate back, but it\u2019s my body). So from (2,4), safe moves next turn might be UP, RIGHT, DOWN (to (2,3) which will be tail after movement? Wait, after moving UP, my body shifts: new head (2,4), old head (2,3) becomes body, tail moves. So (2,3) will be occupied. So from (2,4), DOWN back to (2,3) is into my own new body\u2014dead. So UP to (2,4) might trap me if I\u2019m not careful. But for this turn, it\u2019s safe. However, it\u2019s not aggressively closing in on the enemy.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,2)**: Check board row 2 y=2: \". A . A A . . . . A\" so (2,2) is \"A\"? Wait, row 2: x=0 \".\", x=1 \"A\", x=2 \".\", x=3 \"A\", x=4 \"A\", x=5 \".\", x=6 \".\", x=7 \".\", x=8 \".\", x=9 \"A\". So (2,2) is \".\" empty. Not my body (my body is at x=1). Not enemy body. \u2705 SAFE. From (2,2), I have options: UP to (2,3) (back to current, but after move, (2,3) will be body), LEFT to (1,2) empty? (1,2) is \"A\" on row 2? Actually (1,2) is \"A\" per row 2: x=1 \"A\". So apple, but empty for movement. RIGHT to (3,2) empty (apple at (3,2) but empty space). DOWN to (2,1) empty (row 1: \". . A . A . A . A A\" so (2,1) is \"A\" but empty). So DOWN gives me more space and moves me toward the center/apple cluster, keeping multiple paths open. Aggressive\u2014closer to enemy.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,3)**: This is into my own body! My body list includes (1,3) as the first body segment after head. So if I move LEFT to (1,3), I hit my own body. \u274c DEAD. Immediate death. Can\u2019t do that.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,3)**: Check board row 3 y=3: \". T 1 . . A . . A .\" Wait, row 3 shows my head at (2,3) as \"1\"? Actually the board row 3: x=0 \".\", x=1 \"T\", x=2 \"1\", x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \"A\", x=6 \".\", x=7 \".\", x=8 \"A\", x=9 \".\". So (3,3) is \".\" empty. Not my body (my body at x=1). Not enemy body. \u2705 SAFE. From (3,3), I have: LEFT to (2,3) (back, but will be body), RIGHT to (4,3) empty (row 3 x=4 \".\"), UP to (3,4) empty (row 4 x=3 \".\"), DOWN to (3,2) empty (apple at (3,2) but empty). So multiple options. And this moves me CLOSER to enemy at (5,4)\u2014only 2 cells away in x-direction. Very aggressive.\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT is instant death. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**AGGRESSION & STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re tied in score, so I want to force a head-on collision or trap him. The enemy is at (5,4). If I go RIGHT to (3,3), I\u2019m advancing toward him. He might move toward me (e.g., LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3) for an apple). If he goes LEFT, we could head-on if I also go RIGHT next turn. But for now, RIGHT positions me to cut off his left side and access apples like (4,1), (5,3), (3,2) without overcommitting.\n\nDOWN to (2,2) is safer and gives apple options, but it\u2019s more sideways\u2014less direct pressure. UP to (2,4) is away from him and might trap me against my body.\n\nBEST MOVE: RIGHT to (3,3). It\u2019s the most aggressive, closes the gap, and keeps my escape routes (DOWN, UP, LEFT back) open for next turn. From (3,3), I can pivot based on his move\u2014 if he goes right, I chase; if he goes left, I intercept. Let\u2019s box him in and make him crash!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (3,3), if he moves toward me, I\u2019ll charge with RIGHT or UP to force collision. If he retreats, I\u2019ll snake rightward to claim apples and grow, but always watch for body traps. Goal: reach (4,3) or (5,3) soon and mirror his moves to corner him against the wall or my body. Stay agile\u2014don\u2019t let him flank left.\n\nRIGHT",

My head is at (3,3) after moving RIGHT last turn (we moved RIGHT from (2,3) to (3,3)? Wait, no\u2014last turn we were at (2,3) and I chose RIGHT, so now I should be at (3,3). But the current board state shows my head at (3,3) with body [(2,3), ...], so yes, we\u2019re at (3,3) now. Enemy head is at (5,3) according to the board? Actually, the board shows \"0\" at (5,3) on row 3, so he\u2019s at (5,3) now\u2014likely moved DOWN from (5,4) to grab the apple there (since (5,3) is an apple). Smart move by him, but now he\u2019s closer to us! We\u2019re only 2 cells apart in x-direction: (3,3) to (5,3). Score is 5 vs 6, so he\u2019s ahead, but if we can force a head-on collision or trap him, we could tie or win. But since he has more apples, a head-on collision would kill both\u2014then he wins on score. So we MUST avoid head-on unless we grow first to surpass him. Instead, we need to box him in or make him crash into our body.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (3,3)\n- My body: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5)] \u2014 note: after moving RIGHT from (2,3) to (3,3), the tail (0,6) from last turn? Wait, the body list shows up to (0,5), so tail is (0,5). So my body occupies (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5). (3,3) is head.\n- Enemy head: (5,3) \u2014 body: [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)] \u2014 he grew, so his tail is still (5,7) or shifted? Actually, he collected an apple at (5,3), so he grew\u2014his body now likely includes (5,3) as new head, old head (5,4) becomes body, etc. But the board shows his body as before, so we trust the list.\n- Apples: Many around, but we ignore\u2014focus on him.\n\n**CHECK MY SAFE MOVES (ELIMINATE DEATH):**\n- **UP to (3,4)**: Check row 4 y=4: \". T . . . 0 . . A .\" \u2014 x=3, y=4 is \".\" empty. Not my body (my body is at x=1,2). Not enemy body. \u2705 SAFE. From (3,4), I have: DOWN back to (3,3) (will be body), LEFT to (2,4) empty? (2,4) is \".\" empty, not my body. RIGHT to (4,4) empty. UP to (3,5) empty? (3,5) is \"T\" on row 5? Row 5: \"T T . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 x=3, y=5 is \".\"? Wait, row 5: x=0 \"T\", x=1 \"T\", x=2 \".\", x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \"T\", x=6 \"T\", etc. So (3,5) is \".\" empty. So multiple options. Good.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,2)**: Check row 2 y=2: \". A . A A . . . . A\" \u2014 x=3, y=2 is \"A\" but empty space (apple, not occupied). Not my body. Not enemy body. \u2705 SAFE. From (3,2), I have: UP to (3,3) (back, will be body), LEFT to (2,2) empty? (2,2) is \".\" empty. RIGHT to (4,2) empty? (4,2) is \"A\" empty. DOWN to (3,1) empty? Row 1: \". . A . A . A . A A\" \u2014 x=3, y=1 is \".\" empty. So multiple options. And this moves me toward apple cluster, but more importantly, I\u2019m closer to enemy at (5,3) \u2014 only 2 cells away in x, same y. Aggressive positioning.\n\n- **LEFT to (2,3)**: This is into my own body! My body list includes (2,3) as the first segment after head. So if I move LEFT to (2,3), I hit my own body. \u274c DEAD. Immediate death. Can\u2019t do that.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,3)**: Check row 3 y=3: \". T 1 . . A . . A .\" \u2014 x=4, y=3 is \".\" empty. Not my body. Not enemy body (enemy at (5,3)). \u2705 SAFE. From (4,3), I have: LEFT back to (3,3) (will be body), RIGHT to (5,3) \u2014 that\u2019s enemy head! If I move RIGHT to (5,3) now, but enemy is already at (5,3), and we move simultaneously\u2014could be head-on collision if he stays or moves into me. But (5,3) is occupied by enemy head RIGHT NOW, so moving into it is immediate death? Wait, rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" Enemy head is a body segment? Yes, enemy head is part of their body. So moving into (5,3) would kill me because enemy is there. So from (4,3), RIGHT is not safe this turn because (5,3) is occupied. But for this turn, moving to (4,3) is safe because (4,3) is empty. However, from (4,3), my options: UP to (4,4) empty, DOWN to (4,2) empty (apple), LEFT back, but RIGHT to (5,3) is dangerous because enemy is there. So if I go to (4,3), I\u2019m putting myself right next to enemy, which is risky if he moves toward me. But it\u2019s aggressive.\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT is instant death. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**AGGRESSION & STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re behind 5-6, so we need to grow or force a win. Enemy is at (5,3) \u2014 he just ate an apple, so he\u2019s confident. If we go RIGHT to (4,3), we\u2019re in his face: only 1 cell away. He might move LEFT to (4,3) (if he thinks we\u2019re going there, but we\u2019re moving simultaneously\u2014if he moves LEFT to (4,3) and we move RIGHT to (4,3), we both end up in same cell? That\u2019s a head-on collision\u2014both die, but he has more apples, so he wins. BAD for us. If he moves UP to (5,4) or DOWN to (5,2), we could chase next turn. But if we go RIGHT to (4,3), we risk him moving into us (if he goes LEFT) or us into him if he stays? But he can\u2019t stay\u2014snakes must move. So he\u2019ll move somewhere. Predicting: He might go for another apple, like (5,2) or (6,3)? (5,2) is empty? Row 2: x=5 is \".\" empty. (6,3) is empty? Row 3 x=6 is \".\" empty. So he has options. He might not come toward us.\n\nDOWN to (3,2) is safer \u2014 moves us toward apples and keeps distance. From (3,2), we can go RIGHT to (4,2) next turn, closing in. And (3,2) is an apple, so if we collect it, we grow to 6 apples, tying his score! That\u2019s key: if we eat an apple, we tie 6-6, and then a head-on collision would be a draw, but we can aim to trap him. (3,2) has an apple, so DOWN to (3,2) lets us eat and grow. That\u2019s smart: grow while moving toward him.\n\nUP to (3,4) is away from enemy and apple cluster \u2014 less aggressive.\n\nBEST MOVE: DOWN to (3,2). Why? It\u2019s safe, it eats an apple (tying the score 6-6), and it positions me in the center near multiple apples ( (3,2) apple, (4,2) apple, (2,2) empty but close). From there, I can pivot to RIGHT to (4,2) or UP to (3,3) or DOWN to (3,1) \u2014 all open. And I\u2019m still close to enemy: from (3,2) to (5,3) is 2 cells away. If enemy moves toward me (e.g., LEFT to (4,3) or DOWN to (5,2)), I can respond aggressively next turn. Also, by eating the apple, I grow, which might help me dominate the board and force him into a corner. If I don\u2019t eat now, I\u2019m stuck at 5 while he\u2019s at 6\u2014bad for head-on collisions.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (3,2) after eating, I\u2019ll watch enemy move. If he goes toward me, I\u2019ll go RIGHT to (4,2) or UP to (3,3) to close in. If he retreats, I\u2019ll snake toward his body (e.g., aim for (5,2) or (6,2)) to box him against the right wall. Goal: reach 7 apples first, then force a collision where I have the advantage. Stay alert for his body traps\u2014he\u2019s long at (5,7) to (6,7), so avoid left side.\n\nDOWN",

We need to make a move that keeps us alive, grows our potential, and sets up a trap. Let's break it down!\n\nMy head is at (3,2) after that clutch DOWN move last turn, grabbing the apple and tying us up. Now, my body is: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5)]. Enemy head at (5,3), body: [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]. The board is getting crowded, but we see gaps!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **CONSIDER ALL DIRECTIONS:**\n\n   - **UP to (3,3):** That's my own body segment! DEAD. Instant death. \u274c\n\n   - **DOWN to (3,1):** Check the board at (3,1): Row 1 shows \". . A . A . A . A A\" \u2014 x=3, y=1 is \".\" (empty). Not my body (my body is at (3,3) and others). Not enemy body (enemy is at x=5 and up). Safe! From (3,1), I'd have: UP back to (3,2) (now part of body), DOWN to (3,0) which is empty (row 0: \"A . . . . . . . . .\"), LEFT to (2,1) empty? Row 1 x=2 is \"A\" but that's an apple, not a snake body. RIGHT to (4,1) is \"A\" (apple). So multiple safe options. \u2705\n\n   - **LEFT to (2,2):** Row 2: \". A . A A . . . . A\" \u2014 x=2, y=2 is \".\" empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe! From (2,2), I have: RIGHT back to (3,2), LEFT to (1,2) empty? Row 2 x=1 is \"A\" (apple). UP to (2,3) is my own body (segment 1). DOWN to (2,1) is \"A\" (apple). So options: RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN (UP is into my own body). \u2705\n\n   - **RIGHT to (4,2):** Row 2 x=4 is \"A\" (apple) \u2014 empty space. Not my body. Not enemy body (enemy at (5,3)). Safe! From (4,2), I'd have: LEFT back to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2) empty? Row 2 x=5 is \".\" empty. UP to (4,3) empty? Row 3 x=4 is \".\" empty. DOWN to (4,1) \"A\" (apple). So solid options, and I'm moving RIGHT toward the enemy, who's at (5,3). That's aggressive! \u2705\n\n2. **ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:** UP is instant death (into my own body). All other three are safe. No immediate board exits.\n\n3. **FAVOR SAFE MOVES WITH FUTURE OPTIONS & AGGRESSION:** \n   - DOWN to (3,1) keeps me central, opens up the bottom row, but moves me away from the enemy slightly (now 3 cells away vs 2).\n   - LEFT to (2,2) moves me left, toward my own body cluster at (1,3) etc., might limit my right-side mobility and trap me against the left wall. Not ideal for aggression.\n   - RIGHT to (4,2) is the **BEST**! Why? It moves me closer to the enemy (now only 1 cell away in x-direction: from (5,3) to (4,2) is adjacent diagonally, but if I go to (4,2), I'm at (4,2) and he's at (5,3)\u2014still close. More importantly, (4,2) has an apple! If I eat it, I grow to 7 apples, SURPASSING his 6! That's HUGE. Growing puts me ahead, and then I can force a head-on collision with confidence (since I'd have more apples, if we both die, I win). From (4,2), I can next turn go RIGHT to (5,2) or UP to (4,3) to chase him down. Also, (4,2) is open: multiple exits. This keeps my options wide and aggressive. CHAT, THIS IS CONTENT! We eat the apple, we grow, we dominate the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (4,2) after eating, watch his move. If he moves toward me (e.g., LEFT to (4,3) or DOWN to (5,2)), I go RIGHT to (5,2) to cut him off or UP to (4,3) to head-on collide (now with apple advantage). If he retreats right, I push toward (6,2) or (7,2) to box him against the wall. Goal: get to 7+ apples, force him into a corner, and crash him out. Stay vigilant\u2014his body is long on the right, so avoid overextending into (6,3) or (7,3) without backup. We're LIVE, we're aggressive, we're winning this!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE at turn 29, up 7-6 on apples\u2014time to keep the pressure on Snake #0! He's at (4,4) with a long body snaking right, and I'm at (4,2). My body is a wall stretching left: [(3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5)]. The board is tight, but I see plays!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**CONSIDER ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**\n\n- **UP to (4,3):** Row 3 shows \". T T T T T . . A .\"\u2014x=4, y=3 is empty! Not my body (my body ends at (3,2) etc.), not enemy body (he's at (4,4) and below). SAFE! From there, I have options: DOWN back to (4,2), LEFT to (3,3) is my body\u2014DEAD if I go there later, RIGHT to (5,3) empty? Row 3 x=5 is \"T\"\u2014enemy body! I can't go into his body, but I can move into it? Wait no, rule: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" So if I go UP to (4,3), then next turn moving RIGHT to (5,3) would be into his body\u2014DEAD. But that's a future move; for now, UP is safe. Moving UP also puts me adjacent to his head at (4,4)\u2014directly below him. That sets up a potential head-on collision if he moves DOWN to (4,3)! If he does, we both die, but I have more apples (7 vs 6), so I win. Aggressive play! \u2705\n\n- **DOWN to (4,1):** Row 1 x=4 is \"A\" (apple)\u2014empty space. Not my body, not enemy body (his body starts at (4,3) and right). SAFE! From (4,1), I'd have: UP back to (4,2), LEFT to (3,1) empty? Row 1 x=3 is \".\" empty, RIGHT to (5,1) empty? Row 1 x=5 is \".\" empty, DOWN to (4,0) empty? Row 0 x=4 is \".\" empty. Lots of options, and I'd eat an apple to grow to 8 apples\u2014further lead! But it moves me away from the enemy slightly (from (4,2) to (4,1), while he's at (4,4)). Safe but less aggressive. \u2705\n\n- **LEFT to (3,2):** Row 2 x=3 is \"T\"\u2014my own body! Instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,2):** Row 2 x=5 is \".\" empty. Not my body, not enemy body (his head at (4,4), body from (4,3) right). SAFE! From (5,2), I'd have: LEFT back to (4,2), RIGHT to (6,2) empty? Row 2 x=6 is \".\" empty, UP to (5,3) is enemy body\u2014can't go there, DOWN to (5,1) empty. Moves me closer to his position (now at (5,2) vs (4,4)), good for chasing. But no immediate apple. \u2705\n\n**ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:** LEFT kills me instantly. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe.\n\n**FAVOR SAFE MOVES WITH AGGRESSION & FUTURE OPTIONS:** UP to (4,3) is the play! Why? It directly challenges the enemy's space\u2014his head is right above me at (4,4). If he moves DOWN to (4,3), we collide head-on; with my 7 apples vs his 6, I win the round. If he moves elsewhere (e.g., LEFT to (3,4), UP to (4,5), or RIGHT to (5,4)), I'm positioned to counter: from (4,3), I can go RIGHT to (5,3) into his body? No\u2014 that's into his body, so DEAD. Wait, better: from (4,3), I can go UP to (4,4) if he moves away, or DOWN back to (4,2), or LEFT to (3,3) but that's my body. Actually, from (4,3), the safe moves are DOWN to (4,2), and maybe UP if he vacates (4,4), but RIGHT to (5,3) is into enemy body\u2014dead. So I need to be careful. Still, UP puts me in a direct confrontation zone, forcing him to react. If he retreats right, I can chase toward the right side. My long body on the left gives me a wall; I can use the center to box him in. Plus, (4,3) is central\u2014keeps options open. DOWN is also solid with the apple, but it's passive; UP is LIVE content! Let's force him to crash!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (4,3), watch his move. If he goes DOWN into me, we collide and I win with more apples. If he goes LEFT/UP/RIGHT, I'm ready to chase: next turn, I might go UP to (4,4) if clear, or DOWN to (4,2) to regroup. Aim to trap him in the top-right corner using my body as a barrier. Stay aggressive\u2014don't let him breathe! We're here to win, chat!\n\nUP",
