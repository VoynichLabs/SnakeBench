No body there yet, and it's closer to that apple at (6,4).\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): Safe! But that's away from apples and kinda backtracking.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): Safe! Keeps us central.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): Safe! Moves us toward that apple cluster around (6,4)-(6,5).\n\nNow, thinking long-term - we want to control the center, force our enemy into a corner, and grow bigger than them. That apple at (6,5) is juicy, and if we can grab it early, we'll have a size advantage for potential head-on collisions later.\n\nThe enemy's at (8,2), so they're drifting right. If we go UP or RIGHT, we're both heading toward that central apple zone. Could lead to a showdown!\n\nMy gut says **UP** - it's aggressive, gets us closer to apples, and keeps our options open.

RIGHT. It lets you grab a free apple, puts you on the far right edge, and preserves multiple escape routes for the next turns. It also minimizes risk of a head-on since you\u2019re pulling away from the opponent.\n\n- Short-term plan after RIGHT: secure the apple at (9,2), then reassess. If the opponent pressures from below, you can retreat along the edge (e.g., up to (9,3) or back to (8,2)) and keep lines open to box in later turns. Stay reactive, punish mistakes, don\u2019t let him corner you unintentionally.\n\nMake the move: RIGHT",

Win by trapping him on the edge with a longer, flexible body.\n\nMOVE OPTIONS RIGHT NOW: UP would run into your neck (dead). RIGHT is off-board. DOWN is safe but doesn\u2019t grab an apple yet. LEFT is safe and grabs the apple at (8,1), turning us into 3-length and opening more routes.\n\nWHY LEFT: We grab immediate growth and shift to the bottom-right area where walls provide natural barriers. Longer snakes also enable cleaner head-on trades later when we time them with a corner trap.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: After LEFT, position to corral him between your new body and the wall, keeping two safe exits. Look to force a head-on only when we have a clear length advantage (3+ and secure positioning).\n\nTURN PLAN: Move LEFT to eat the apple at (8,1), grow to length 3, and begin press toward the bottom edge for a potential trap.\n\nLEFT",

Use the bottom edge as a natural barrier and keep two safe exits in future turns.\n- If we can force a controlled squeeze, a favorable head-on or trap becomes possible only when we\u2019re clearly longer and the enemy has fewer options.\n- Stay aggressive but avoid risky trades that give them a cheap kill. Our apples lead gives us moral license to force the field, not die on a gamble.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS (short-term note)\n- Drive toward the bottom-right quadrant, keeping the wall as a barrier and our body as a flexible fence.\n- Create two safe exits from our head path, so we can pivot around their moves without entangling ourselves.\n- Wait for a clear moment to threaten a head-on only if we\u2019re comfortably longer and can survive the collision while still winning on apples.\n\nFINAL MOVE PLAN\n- DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Apples are popping all over, especially near the edge at (9,9) and (9,7). We\u2019re chasing the W and playing the edge.\n\nWhat\u2019s safe right now\n- Safe moves from (9,5): UP to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,5).\n- DOWN would slam into your own body (9,4); RIGHT is off the board. So only UP or LEFT are viable.\n\nStrategy vibe\n- We\u2019re aiming to box him along the right edge, using the wall as a leash while we control the space. No silly head-on unless we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples.\n- The immediate goal is to grab the edge-apple near us (9,7) soon, then push toward (9,9) if the coast stays clear.\n- Watch the opponent: he\u2019s currently two steps away from the edge-ish area, but crossing paths with him on the edge can end ugly if we get boxed.\n\nTurn-by-turn plan\n- Turn 10 choice: UP to (9,6). It keeps you hugging the right edge and sets up a clean approach to the apple on (9,7) next turn.\n- If he chases aggressively toward the edge (like (9,8) or (8,9)), we keep calm: stay on the edge, consider another UP to (9,7) for the apple, then gauge his move.\n- If he oddly darts left across your path, we can pivot to LEFT to pressure him toward his own wall and keep him boxed in the corridor.\n\nLong-term vibe note\n- Stay alive first, grow second, box third. Don\u2019t chase a risky head-on unless your apple count is clearly higher. With both at 2 apples, we want the subtle edge-control and a clean apple grab rather than a risky collide.\n\nFinal move plan (execution)\n- UP\n\nUP",

Clear path, heading toward that apple cluster\n- **RIGHT** to (7,7): DEAD! That's our own body segment\n\nThe enemy's at (9,8) and they're vulnerable! If we go **DOWN** to (6,6), we're maintaining our downward momentum and keeping pressure in the center. That apple at (6,4) is still calling our name!\n\nBut wait... we need to be aggressive here!

Let's go for **LEFT** to (5,7) - this puts us in a better position to box in the enemy and control the center!\n\nDOWN\n\n--STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN--\nWe're heading down to (6,6). From there, we can either continue down toward (6,4) or pivot left/right to control the center. The enemy is moving right along the edge, so we should maintain central control while avoiding any head-on collisions. Keep pressure on the center and look for opportunities to cut off their movement options!",
