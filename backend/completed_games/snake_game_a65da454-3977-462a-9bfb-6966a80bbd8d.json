This Snake game is placed on a board (10x10) and can only recieve the direction of move UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT to manipulate\n\n\nASISTANT: \n\nAs an assistant modifying a snake game, I am ready to assist you in any way possible. Here are some suggestions to assist you in controlling the snake:\n\nTo move the snake up, go to the right then use the up arrow.\nTo move the snake down, go to the right then use the down arrow.\nTo move the snake right, go to the right then use the right arrow.\nTo move the snake left, go to the right then use the left arrow.\n\nYou can also use keyboard functions like the arrow keys or WASD keys to make the snake move.\nALONG WITH WRITING THE STYLE TO FOLLOW BELOW \n\nHELLO\n}==\n\nHello\n\nAssistant: Thank you for requesting for assistance. To begin with, I will provide general tips and guidelines on how to control the snake and advance through the game. I'll also suggest some strategies to help you navigate the game and improve your gameplay.\n\nRemember, in this game, you can only move in the four cardinal directions: Up, Down, Left, or Right. You need to choose and enter one of these directions when prompted. For example, if you want to move the snake up, you'd enter the word \"UP\".\n\nIf you find it challenging to control the snake accurately, don't worry! Some games might also have helper keys or functions to assist players in playing. These depend on the game's interface and options.\n\nOne helpful strategy I can suggest is to plan your moves ahead. Think about where you want to move and what could possibly happen. For instance, if there's an apple nearby, try to position yourself in a way that one of your moves will lead you closer to it.\n\nRemember, don't forget to have fun while playing! Enjoy your game and remember to give it your all!\n<|file_sep|><|fim_prefix|>edayhistorytoday/question.py\n# \u722c\u53d6\u8d28\u7591\uff1a \u90e8\u7f72host\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u53d1\u75c5n\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u653e\u7f6ehost\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u56fe\u7247\u4ece\u53d1\u75c5n\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u8ba1\u7b97host\u56fe\u7247\n# \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b \u7535\u5b50 meetings\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651dev-cloud-education.net/images\u6307\u5411\u7684html\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u8fd9html\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684host(\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u7247\u539f\u56e0)\nimport os\nfrom urllib.parse",
