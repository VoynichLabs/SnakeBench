The board is WIDE OPEN.\n\nChecking my four moves:\n*   UP: To (9,5). That's safe. It's empty.\n*   DOWN: To (9,3). That's also safe and empty.\n*   LEFT: To (8,4). Safe and empty.\n*   RIGHT: Can't go right, I'm on the edge! \u274c That's OFF THE BOARD. DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n\nSo we got UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, long-term plan? We need to DOMINATE. The enemy is way down in the bottom-left corner. We're on the right edge. I see apples at (8,0) and (7,0) near him... but we gotta be smart. If we go straight down for them, we're just chasing. We need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE.\n\nHe's at (6,0). His only safe moves are UP to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,0). If he goes RIGHT, he gets an apple and grows. We need to start moving to control the center and the top-right where there's a cluster of apples. We have the high ground!\n\nSo my instinct is to move AWAY from him initially, let him commit, and then we swoop in. Moving LEFT to (8,4) gets me more towards the center of the board, gives me more options next turn. Going UP or DOWN keeps me on the edge, which is a little riskier long-term.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is bottom-left. Don't engage yet. Control the center and top-right apple clusters. Force him into a corner later. Prioritize board control over chasing apples he's closer to.\n\nAlright chat, the play is to move towards the center, increase our options, and set up the squeeze play later. LET'S GO!\n\nLEFT",

No chance he\u2019ll crash into us this turn.  \n\n**Possible moves:**  \n- **UP \u2192 (6,1):** Safe, but no apple right now.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,0):** Safe, still no apple.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,0):** **Boom!** Apple sits right there. Eating it grows us to length\u202f2, gives us a point, and opens a direct line to the next apple at (8,0) on the following turn.  \n\n**Down** is off\u2011board, so we\u2019re out.  \n\n**Future outlook:**  \n- After taking (7,0) we\u2019ll have body at (6,0). Next turn we can slide right again to snag (8,0) \u2013 two apples in two moves, boosting our length fast.  \n- A longer snake means more control and the ability to start hemming the opponent later.  \n\nNo head\u2011on danger with the opponent this turn, and moving right keeps our options wide open (up, right, left). So the aggressive, apple\u2011hungry play is the obvious winner.  \n\nLet\u2019s grab that fruit and start building the wall! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Move:**  \nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is chilling at (8,0) with a body at (7,0) and (6,0). They have 2 apples, we have 1. We gotta close that gap!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK TIME:** \ud83d\udd0d\n\n*   **UP:** To (8,6). That's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **DOWN:** To (8,4). That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SELF-DESTRUCT. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n*   **LEFT:** To (7,5). That's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT:** To (9,5). That's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are ILLEGAL! We're choosing between UP and LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nThe enemy is directly south of us at (8,0). If we go DOWN, we die. So not an option. But we need to think where HE might go. From (8,0):\n*   His UP is (8,1) - Empty.\n*   His LEFT is (7,0) - His own body! \u274c\n*   His RIGHT is (9,0) - Off the board! \u274c\n*   His DOWN is (8,-1) - Off the board! \u274c\n\nHOLD UP CHAT! \ud83e\udd2f The enemy is TRAPPED! His only possible move is UP to (8,1)! HE HAS NO CHOICE! This is our chance!\n\nSo next turn, we KNOW he will be at (8,1). If we move LEFT to (7,5), we're safe, but he climbs the ladder towards us.\n\nBUT WHAT IF... we move UP to (8,6)? That's safe, but it gives him more room to breathe and maybe get an apple down low. We need to be AGGRESSIVE. We have the positional advantage.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:** \ud83d\udca1\nOur long-term plan is to BOX HIM IN. He's stuck on the left edge. We need to control the space above him. If we go UP now, we're not directly threatening him. If we go LEFT to (7,5), we're moving to the center, which gives us more options to cut him off later. BUT WAIT...\n\nActually, let's think one more turn ahead. If we go UP to (8,6), next turn we can go LEFT to (7,6) or further UP. We start controlling the top. If we go LEFT to (7,5), next turn we can go DOWN to (7,4) to potentially block his path upwards, or LEFT again to (6,5).\n\nHmm... going LEFT feels more aggressive, like we're starting to cut the board. Going UP is safer but lets him live longer. We have a score deficit to overcome. I think we need to be bold, chat!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** \ud83d\ude80\nWe're going LEFT! Let's start moving to control the center and prepare to drop down on this trapped snake! He can only go UP, so we need to meet him head-on when we have the length advantage! LET'S GO!\n\nLEFT",

We're at turn 5, early game.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- Our head is at (7,5), body segment behind us at (7,4).\n- Enemy snake (#1) head is at (7,2), with body at (8,2) and (8,1).\n- 1 apple vs their 2 apples - we're behind! We need to catch up FAST.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER:**\nWe need to avoid crashing into the enemy. Since moves are simultaneous, we need to predict where they might go.\n\nEnemy options from (7,2):\n- UP to (7,3) - possible, but risky if we go there?\n- DOWN to (7,1) - safe for them\n- LEFT to (6,2) - safe  \n- RIGHT to (8,2) - would crash into their own body! So they likely won't go RIGHT.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n- UP to (7,6) - looks clear, gets us away from enemy\n- DOWN to (7,4) - CRASH into our own body! \u274c ELIMINATED\n- LEFT to (6,5) - has an apple! But is it safe?\n- RIGHT to (8,5) - empty, safe move\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nThe apple at (6,5) is tempting! But if enemy goes UP to (7,3) and we go LEFT to (6,5), we'd be adjacent but not colliding this turn. However, if they go LEFT to (6,2), they're moving away from us.\n\nActually, WAIT! If we go LEFT to (6,5) and they go UP to (7,3), we'd be safe. But if they go LEFT to (6,2), also safe. The risky move would be if they go UP then next turn we might collide, but we can deal with that later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to secure that apple at (6,5) to tie the score at 2-2! Then we can think about cutting off the enemy. The enemy is currently south of us, so going LEFT to get the apple puts some distance between us while also scoring.\n\nGoing UP to (7,6) is safe but doesn't get us closer to any apples immediately. The nearest apples are at (6,5) and (4,4) - LEFT gets us toward both.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nLEFT to (6,5) gets us the apple, ties the score, and keeps options open. It's calculated risk but the enemy is more likely to go LEFT or DOWN than UP into our path.\n\nLEFT",

Where's he going from (6,2)?\n*   UP to (6,3): Puts him closer to apples. Very likely! \u2705\n*   DOWN to (6,1): Safe, but moves him away from the action. \u274c\n*   LEFT to (5,2): Also safe, but again, away from apples. \u274c\n*   RIGHT to (7,2): INSTANT DEATH into his own body! He's not that dumb. \u274c\n\nSo he's probably going UP! That means his head will be at (6,3) next.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n*   UP to (6,6): Puts our head at (6,6). Safe space. But then we're directly above the enemy at (6,3)... that's a VERTICAL STACK! We could get into a nasty jam next turn if he follows us up. Risky long-term. \ud83e\udd14\n*   DOWN to (6,4): CRASH! That's our own body segment at (7,4)? Wait, no! Check the coordinates! Our body is at (7,5) and (7,4). (6,4) is empty! My bad chat, FALSE ALARM! \u2705 So DOWN is actually SAFE. It moves us away from the enemy's predicted path.\n*   LEFT to (5,5): Wide open space. Puts us closer to the apple cluster around (4,4), (4,2). This is AGGRESSIVE. But are we running away? Nah, we're repositioning for a power play! \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (7,5): CRASH! That's our own neck! Absolutely not. \u274c\n\n**THE CLUTCH DECISION:**\nSo our safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\nWe need to think about CONTROL. If we go UP to (6,6), we're letting the enemy come up behind us. If we go DOWN to (6,4), we're just moving sideways along our body, not really gaining ground.\n\nLEFT to (5,5) is the MOVE! It expands our territory towards the left side of the board where there are apples. It keeps us safe from an immediate head-on collision because the enemy is going up. We're not running, we're FLANKING! Next turn, we can swing down and cut him off from the apples on the left. This is how we start building the box! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're maneuvering to control the left side. Enemy is likely on the right-center. Force him into the edges! Our goal is to get between him and the apples, then squeeze.\n\nLEFT",

Let's check each move:\n*   UP (5,6): Empty. Looks safe.\n*   DOWN (5,4): Empty. Also safe.\n*   LEFT (4,5): Empty. Safe.\n*   RIGHT (6,5): That's our own neck! INSTANT DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**NOW PREDICT THE ENEMY! \ud83e\udd14**\nWhere's HE gonna go from (5,2)?\n*   UP (5,3): Empty. Puts him near apples. Likely.\n*   DOWN (5,1): Empty. Moves away from the action. Less likely.\n*   LEFT (4,2): Empty. Also possible.\n*   RIGHT (6,2): HIS OWN BODY! He's not that dumb. \u274c\n\nSo his most aggressive/probable moves are UP or LEFT. This is KEY.\n\n**WHICH OF OUR SAFE MOVES IS BEST? LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.**\n\n*   **UP to (5,6)**: This moves us away from him. But are we running? It opens up the top of the board, but it feels a little passive. If he goes UP to (5,3), we're creating a vertical column. Could be useful for boxing later, but not aggressive right now.\n\n*   **DOWN to (5,4)**: This moves us DOWN... wait a second. If he goes UP to (5,3), our heads are now at (5,4) and (5,3). THAT'S A VERTICAL STANDOFF! \ud83d\ude33 We're directly on top of each other. Next turn, if we both go towards each other... HEAD-ON COLLISION! But we're tied on apples (2-2), so that's a DOUBLE KO and we lose the round!? NO! GAME RULES: If ALL snakes die, the one with MORE apples wins. We're TIED. So it's a DRAW. We don't want a draw, we want to WIN! Going DOWN risks a forced draw if he goes UP. That's not a win. That's settling. Are we settlers? NO!\n\n*   **LEFT to (4,5)**: THIS IS THE MOVE. \ud83d\udc51 It moves us AWAY from a potential vertical standoff. It pushes us into the WIDE OPEN left side of the board where there's an apple cluster (4,4)! We're not running, we're executing a FLANKING MANEUVER! From (4,5), we can go DOWN to (4,4) for an apple, or further LEFT to control more space. We're cutting off his access to the left-side apples. This is how we start DOMINATING the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're taking control of the left flank. The enemy is likely to be centered or right-side. Our goal is to get bigger by eating the left-side apples, then use our length to trap him against the top or right walls. FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER! \ud83d\udce6\n\nLEFT",

ENEMY HEAD: (4,1) with 3 apples. WE STILL HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! 5 segments vs 4! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHECKING OUR MOVES:\n- **UP to (2,5)**: That's our OWN NECK! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 That's the body segment right behind our head! INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATED!\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Empty cell! And there's an APPLE at (2,3)! \ud83c\udf4e SAFE and we GROW! Puts us closer to the bottom wall but that's fine.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: Empty cell. No apple. Moves us left, away from the enemy. Is that what we want? \ud83e\udd14\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Empty cell! And there's an APPLE at (3,3) nearby! Also, this moves us TOWARDS the enemy! AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\ude08\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: Snake #1 at (4,1). Their safe moves?

If we can force a head-on collision, WE WIN! Moving RIGHT to (3,4) sets up a potential confrontation next turn. We can go DOWN to (3,3) for the apple or continue right to cut them off. Moving DOWN to (2,3) gets us an apple but lets the enemy potentially move up the right side. We need to be AGGRESSIVE and use our lead to box them in!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF: CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE! After moving right, we can move down to (3,3) for the apple, positioning ourselves between the enemy and the center of the board. Force them towards the bottom-right corner! With our length, we can control more space and limit their moves. A head-on collision is our win condition! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nRIGHT",

We can move DOWN to (4,3) next to block their leftward escape, or RIGHT to (5,4) to meet them head-on if they move up. With our length, we can create a WALL they can't pass.

Wait, no, the board shows our head is ON (4,4) and it's labeled '0', so that's us. The apple is adjacent?!\n\nLet me check the board... OH! The apple list says (3,3) is an apple. Our head is at (4,4). So DOWN to (3,4)... wait, our body is at (3,4)! \ud83d\udc80 That's the neck! So DOWN is DEATH.\n\nOKAY, BREAKDOWN TIME! Our options from (4,4):\n\n1.  **UP to (4,5)**: That's our own body at (4,5)! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 That's our tail from a couple turns ago! INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED!\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3,4)**: That's ALSO our own body! \ud83d\udc80 That's our neck! Right behind our head! INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3,4)**: SAME PROBLEM! That's the same cell as option 2! OUR NECK! \ud83d\udc80 DEATH! So LEFT and DOWN are the SAME DEADLY SQUARE! WE ARE SURROUNDED BY OUR OWN BODY?! \ud83d\ude31\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5,4)**: Wait... let's check the board. (5,4) is empty! \ud83d\udfe2 It's labeled as '.'! THAT'S OUR ONLY OPTION!\n\nHOLD UP CHAT! ARE WE TRAPPED? Did our last move put us in a corner? We successfully moved RIGHT last turn to (4,4), which had the apple, so we GREW! But now our body wraps around us! Our head is at (4,4), our neck is at (3,4), and our tail is at (4,5)?! Our body is [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]... So yes! We are boxed in by ourselves! The ONLY safe move is RIGHT to (5,4)! There's no choice! \ud83d\ude05\n\nENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83d\udc0d #1 at (6,1):\nTheir body: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]. What will they do?\n-   **UP to (6,2)**: Empty. Likely move to get space.\n-   **DOWN to (6,0)**: Empty. Also possible.\n-   **LEFT to (5,1)**: Their own NECK! \ud83d\udc80 IMPOSSIBLE!\n-   **RIGHT to (7,1)**: Empty. Also possible.\n\nThey'll probably avoid us and go UP or RIGHT.\n\nOUR MASTER PLAN \ud83e\udde0 (for future self!):\nWE HAVE NO CHOICE LOL! We go RIGHT to (5,4). This buys us a turn. Next turn, our tail will move, freeing up space. From (5,4), our options should open up! We can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT to continue our aggressive push. The enemy is to our bottom-left. We need to swing around and cut them off from the center. Our goal is to use our length advantage to create a barrier and force them into a bad spot. STAY ALIVE THIS TURN, THEN STRIKE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe move is FORCED! But it's SAFE!\n\nRIGHT",

They're low on the board, so if we control the center and top, we can slowly constrict them. AVOID going into the bottom-left where it's cramped. Keep the pressure on!

The right\u2011side apple is the quickest, safest and also positions me to trap the opponent against the top\u2011right corner later.\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f15** \u2013 **RIGHT** to (8,\u202f0).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f16** \u2013 UP to (8,\u202f1).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f17** \u2013 UP to (8,\u202f2).  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f18** \u2013 RIGHT to (9,\u202f2) and snatch the apple.  \n\nMeanwhile the enemy will be forced either down the centre (giving us vertical space) or rightward into the wall where we can seal the trap.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Verdict:** Aggressive, apple\u2011hungry, and future\u2011proof.

Empty space! \u2705 SAFE!\n2.  **DOWN to (6,3)**: Is it safe? Board shows '.'! Also empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n3.  **LEFT to (5,4)**: Is it safe? \ud83d\udc80 THAT'S OUR OWN NECK!

UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT IS STILL A DEATH TRAP! \ud83d\ude05\n\nSTRATEGIC ANALYSIS \ud83e\udde0:\nENEMY HEAD is at (7,0). Where can they go from there?\n*   Their UP to (7,1) is their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n*   Their DOWN is off the board! \u274c DEAD!\n*   Their LEFT to (6,0) is empty! \u2705\n*   Their RIGHT to (8,0) is empty! \u2705\n\nSO THEY HAVE TO MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT ALONG THE BOTTOM WALL! They're TRAPPED DOWN THERE! This is our chance! \ud83d\ude08\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,4), we're moving directly above their possible paths. We can start building a wall! If we go DOWN to (6,3), we're getting closer, but we might not cut them off as effectively. If we go UP to (6,5), we're moving away from the fight, which is WAY too passive when the enemy is on the ropes!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcaa:\nTHEY ARE BOXED IN! They only have two moves: left or right along y=0. We need to move to a spot that controls the center and can quickly drop down to cut off their escape. RIGHT to (7,4) is PERFECT! Next turn, we can go DOWN to (7,3), then (7,2), and (7,1), completely sealing off the entire right side of the board from them! They'll have nowhere to go but into us, and since we're tied, a head-on collision is a DOUBLE KO... BUT WAIT! If we grow by just ONE apple, we win a head-on collision! There's an apple at (9,7)... maybe we can loop around and grab it while maintaining the pressure? FOCUS! First, we press the advantage! RIGHT puts us in the dominant position!\n\nTHE MOVE: RIGHT to (7,4)! LET'S BOX HIM IN AND WATCH HIM PANIC! THIS IS HOW WE WIN!\n\nRIGHT",

None intersect my two safe squares (8,\u202f2) or (9,\u202f1), so no head\u2011on threat this turn.\n\n**\ud83e\udded Tactical thinking**\n\n- **UP** keeps me in column\u202f8, preserving lateral freedom for the next few turns. I can still snag the juicy (9,\u202f2) apple with the classic \u201cUP,\u202fUP,\u202fRIGHT\u201d combo, but I maintain a backup route (UP,\u202fLEFT,\u202fUP\u2026) if the opponent tries to herd me toward the wall.\n- **RIGHT** would slam me against the right border immediately. While it also reaches (9,\u202f2) in two moves, it cuts my escape routes to a single vertical line\u2014dangerous if the enemy starts pressing from the top.\n\n**\u2705 Decision**  \nPlay **UP** to (8,\u202f2): safest, most flexible, and still on track for the (9,\u202f2) apple while keeping the opponent boxed in his own row\u202f5 corridor.\n\n**\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan (next 4 turns)**\n1.

Turn\u202f19 \u2013 **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,\u202f3) then **DOWN** to grab (9,\u202f2) on the following turn, or simply **RIGHT** then **UP** if the apple spawns again.  \n4. After the apple, swing left\u2011upward to press the rival into the top\u2011right corner and limit his maneuver space.\n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nUP",

Looks safe.\n*   **DOWN \u27a1\ufe0f (7,4)**: That's my own neck! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80 IMMEDIATE DEATH. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **LEFT \u27a1\ufe0f (6,5)**: Empty. Looks safe.\n*   **RIGHT \u27a1\ufe0f (8,5)**: Empty. Looks safe.\n\nSo DOWN is suicide. We have UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**NOW, WHAT'S THE ENEMY DOING?** \ud83e\udd14 Snake #1 head at (8,1).\nWhere can he go?\n*   UP to (8,2): Empty.\n*   DOWN to (8,0): That's his own body! He'd die. He's not THAT dumb... probably. So maybe he avoids DOWN.\n*   LEFT to (7,1): His own body again! He's trapped against himself. His only SAFE moves are UP and RIGHT to (9,1).\n\n**THIS IS HUGE!** He's pinned! His only good escape is UP or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (9,1), he's on the edge. If he goes UP to (8,2), he's more open.\n\n**MY LONG-TERM PLAN: BOX HIM IN!** \ud83e\udd4a He's on the bottom edge. I'm above him. I need to cut off his escape upwards. If I move LEFT to (6,5) or RIGHT to (8,5), I'm not really pressuring him. But if I go UP to (7,6), I'm moving to control the center of the board, setting up to swing down and trap him against the wall. He has fewer options than me. I need to use my board control to limit him further.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION?** We're tied on score, so a head-on collision would be a double KO \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udca5 which is BAD for us. We want to win, not tie. So I need to anticipate his move and AVOID being in the same cell as him next turn. Since he can only really go UP or RIGHT, and I'm at (7,5), a direct collision isn't likely this turn unless I do something crazy. Going UP is safe from him.\n\n**APPLE CHASE?** Nah, chat, forget the apples for a second! There's an apple at (7,9) but that's a distraction. The real prize is SNAKE #1's head! We play for the WIN, not for content points! \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (7,6), next turn I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP to continue maneuvering. It keeps me flexible. Moving right to (8,5) also gives options, but it feels less aggressive in cutting off the enemy.\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP puts me in a powerful central position to control the board and start the process of boxing in Snake #1, who is already half-trapped. It's the aggressive, dominating move. LET'S GO.\n\nUP",

He won't do that.\n*   LEFT to (7,8): OUR HEAD! That would be a head-on collision! Since he's longer (8 apples vs our 7), he might take that trade! \ud83e\udd11 But it's risky for him too.\n*   RIGHT to (9,8): That's his own body! \ud83d\udc80 Death. No.\n\nSo his safest move is probably UP to (8,9). If he does that, then (8,8) becomes empty, and our move RIGHT becomes SAFE. But if he decides to be AGGRESSIVE and go LEFT into us, we're dead.\n\n**THE GAMBLE!** We have to assume he wants to survive and will take the safe move UP to the apple. If we don't move RIGHT, we're stuck and die next turn anyway. Moving RIGHT is our ONLY POTENTIAL PATH TO LIFE. It's an ALL-IN BET that he moves UP!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN IF WE SURVIVE:** If he goes UP and we go RIGHT, we're at (8,8) and he's at (8,9). We're side-by-side again! We need to immediately break away, maybe head DOWN the right side to open up space. We CANNOT get trapped like this again! We need to get an apple to tie the score so we can challenge him!\n\nWe're betting it all on his self-preservation instinct! LET'S ROLL THE DICE! \ud83c\udfb2\n\nRIGHT",
