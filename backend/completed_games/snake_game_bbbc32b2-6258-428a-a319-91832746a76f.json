I would immediately collect an apple.\n   - No obstacles, no collision risk\n   - Safe move \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move from (7, 8) to (7, 7)\n   - No apple here, open space\n   - Safe move \u2713\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move from (7, 8) to (6, 8)\n   - No apple here, open space\n   - Safe move \u2713\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Move from (7, 8) to (8, 8)\n   - No apple here, open space\n   - Enemy snake at (8, 6), not (8, 8)\n   - Safe move \u2713\n\n**Apple Evaluation:**\nThe most valuable move is clearly UP, which moves me to (7, 9) where there's an apple. This gives me:\n- +1 apple immediately\n- Growth of my snake\n- A safe position\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8, 6). On this turn, it will move somewhere. The possible directions it could move are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Even if it moves to (8, 7) or (8, 8) or other adjacent cells, moving UP to (7, 9) keeps me far from its current position and trajectory.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nEarly in the game with both snakes being just heads, I should prioritize collecting apples to grow. The apple at (7, 9) is directly above me. After collecting it, I can position myself near other apples like (6, 5) or (5, 8). The enemy snake seems to be in the lower-right quadrant, so apples in the upper-left to middle area might be safer targets initially.\n\nUP",

It immediately gives me apple #5 (increasing my score to 5)\n2. It puts me ahead of the enemy (they have 3)\n3. It positions me well to collect more apples nearby at (1, 5) and (0, 1)\n4. The enemy is at (6, 4), far away from my position\n5. No safety concerns with this move\n\n**Long-term plan for next 3 turns:**\n- Turn 9 (next): Move LEFT to (2, 8) and collect apple #5\n- Turn 10: Move DOWN to (2, 7), continuing downward toward (1, 5) or (0, 1)\n- Turn 11+: Navigate toward the cluster at (0, 1) and (1, 5), staying aware of enemy movements\n- Currently leading 4-3, aim to extend lead by collecting easier apples first\n\nLEFT",
