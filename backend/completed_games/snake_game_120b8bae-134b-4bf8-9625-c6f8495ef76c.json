Clear path ahead; no known obstacles directly in that line.  \n- Moving LEFT to (4,8) would take us away from the target apple and might risk dead ends or unnecessary loops.  \n- Moving DOWN to (5,7) overlaps with our own body, which is forbidden and causes collision. Not an option.  \n\nGiven that the apple at (9,8) is directly to the right, and our current position at (5,8) is well aligned to approach it, moving RIGHT seems the safest and most direct way to get closer. Also, there's no immediate threat or obstacle on that path.\n\nNext turn, I will consider whether to keep approaching the apple or plan to navigate around other apples or obstacles.
