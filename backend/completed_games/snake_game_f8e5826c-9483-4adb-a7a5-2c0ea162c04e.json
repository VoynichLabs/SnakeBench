UP: (9,9) - off board (invalid)\n2. DOWN: (8,8) - enemy snake's head (invalid)\n3. LEFT: (8,8) - enemy snake's head (invalid)\n4. RIGHT: (9,9) - off board (invalid)\n\nWait a minute - this seems problematic! All four possible moves appear to be invalid based on the current position. Let me double-check the board coordinates:\n\nLooking at the board visualization:\n```\n9 . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . 1 0\n7 . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . A .\n5 . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . A . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . A . A . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . A .\n```\n\nI see that my snake (0) is at (8,9) not (9,8) - I misread the coordinates! The board shows my snake at the top-right corner which is (8,9) in 0-based coordinates (since y increases upward). Let me correct this:\n\n**Corrected Current State:**\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (8,9) - top right corner\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,8) - one cell below me\n\n**Possible Moves from (8,9):**\n1. UP: (8,10) - off board (invalid)\n2. DOWN: (8,8) - enemy snake's head (invalid)\n3. LEFT: (7,9) - empty space (valid)\n4. RIGHT: (9,9) - off board (invalid)\n\nOnly LEFT is valid. Moving LEFT would take me to (7,9).\n\n**Analysis of LEFT move:**\n- This is the only safe move available\n- Moving to (7,9) would put me adjacent to the enemy snake at (8,8)\n- No apples are in immediate reach\n- This move keeps me alive and maintains some mobility\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nSince this is the first move, I need to establish position while avoiding immediate threats. The LEFT move to (7,9) is the only safe option. From there, I should:\n1. Avoid getting trapped in corners\n2. Position myself to intercept apples while maintaining escape routes\n3. Watch the enemy snake's movements carefully\n4. Prioritize apples that are reachable without putting myself in danger\n\nLEFT",

All four directions are initially safe, as the snake has no body to collide with and cannot move off the board. However, moving right might inadvertently position us in a spot where snake #0's future movements could create a dangerous situation if they block our escape path. Similarly, moving left or up offers no immediate apple rewards. \n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (8,7), we take a step toward the closest apple at (8,6) in two moves, while minimizing exposure to snake #0. Snake #0\u2019s head at (9,8) could move left, down, or up. If snake #0 moves down, we can continue southward toward (8,6) safely. If snake #0 moves left, we are safe at (8,7) away from their new position. Moving up or left would delay access to prioritized apples without urgency. \n\n**Long-term plan**: Consistently move down from (8,8) toward (8,6), then continue to (8,0) if possible. Avoid tight corridors where snake #0 can block escape routes by predicting their potential left/down movements. \n\nDOWN",
