None of our body or the enemy\u2019s body is in those cells, so all moves are safe for now. But which one gives us the most control? I want to stay central while closing the net toward the enemy\u2019s scuffed corner near (0,9). Going UP keeps me aligned with the top row and still allows quick pivots toward the left side later, whereas DOWN starts drifting into lower territory where we risk losing sight of him. Left would be decent for heading toward him, but I\u2019d like to maintain vertical flexibility before committing. Right doesn\u2019t help box him at all.\n\nSo I\u2019m gonna push UP\u2014keeps options open, keeps multiple follow-up moves, and starts me climbing toward the same space he\u2019s trying to own. Let\u2019s start building that wall.\n\nPlan note for future self: Keep shadowing opponent\u2019s trajectory toward the northwest corner, force him to waste space near the wall, then cut him off with a horizontal sweep once he\u2019s committed. Keep tabs on apples only as they help extend territory; priority is closing on the enemy head and making the board smaller for him.\n\nUP",

Off the board! \u274c UP is DEATH.\n*   To my left? Also off the board! \u274c LEFT is DEATH.\n*   The only other option is RIGHT to (1,9). That's EMPTY too. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo my immediate safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. Let's think about the FUTURE.\n\n*   **DOWN to (0,8):** This keeps me on the left edge. Next turn from there, I could go DOWN again to (0,7), RIGHT to (1,8), or LEFT (dead). That's two potential safe moves.\n*   **RIGHT to (1,9):** This moves me slightly toward the center and closer to a cluster of apples at (3,9) and (4,9). Next turn from (1,9), I could go DOWN to (1,8), LEFT to (0,9) (where I just was, safe), or RIGHT to (2,9). That's THREE potential safe moves. More options = more power! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE ENEMY?\nHe's at (5,7). He has a bunch of options. He might go for the apple at (4,6) DOWN and LEFT, or (7,7) RIGHT and DOWN. He's not an immediate threat to me, but I need to control the board. Moving RIGHT gives me more room to maneuver and potentially cut him off from the top-left quadrant later.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:\nWE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\ude80 The enemy is isolated in the center-right. Let's expand our territory along the top and left edges, then swing down to box him in. Keep an eye on his length vs ours. If we get longer, we can force head-on collisions for the win. Priority #1: Secure the top-left apple cluster and grow! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nTHE MOVE IS CLEAR, CHAT! RIGHT gives us more options and starts our path of DOMINATION!\n\nRIGHT",

No bodies to worry about, so it\u2019s wide open.\n\nGoing LEFT keeps us aligned with the northwest corner and lets me pivot toward the top row faster. If he tries to drop down or swing right, I can respond with more pressure, and my next few moves will still have options \u2014 I can keep climbing toward row 9 or start cutting across. I want to start boxing him into that cramped upper-left area, and being on that same horizontal plane gives me that leverage. \n\nPlan note for future self: Shadow his movement toward the NW wall, keep my head close to row 9, then once he\u2019s committed to that corner, sweep horizontally to shrink his options while staying clear of any head-on risk until I\u2019m ready to force one.\n\nLEFT",

I can\u2019t go LEFT because I just came from there, and DOWN or RIGHT just lets him breathe and drift away\u2014nah, I want to close that corridor. Heading UP into (4,9) not only grabs an apple but also keeps me glued to Row 9 with him, so now I can mirror or shadow his movement and start hemming him into that northwest corner.

Next turn, we can go DOWN to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,9)\u2014but if snake #1 ate (4,9), moving there might be risky (into his body). Still, we'll have options! Moving DOWN now to (2,8) gives more immediate pathways, but we MISS the apple and let snake #1 potentially take the lead in score! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! dominating the board means growing faster and boxing him in. Right now, scores are equal, so avoid head-on collisions\u2014but no risk this turn since snake #1 can't reach (3,9) in one move. So RIGHT is the PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Stick to the top row! After this, assess snake #1's move\u2014if he took (4,9), we go DOWN to (3,8) to avoid his body and hunt other apples. If he didn't, we can push RIGHT to (4,9)!\n\nCHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR!

RIGHT to (5,9) is safe, but it gives him the breathing room to drop into the open area and maybe slip away while I chase apples, which is not the boxing-in mission we came here for. I want him hemmed in, not free to roam.\n\nPlan note: Keep the fight on row 9 as long as possible, force him to edge toward the corner, then lock the channel by folding back down the wall once he hits row 8\u2014no mercy, just pressure.\n\nLEFT",

We just ate that apple, LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa Now we gotta assess the board and keep the pressure on snake #1!\n\nFirst, check our head position and our body: Head at (3,9), body now is [(2,9)]. Let's check all directions:\n\n*   **UP to (3,10)?** Off the board! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. NOPE!\n*   **DOWN to (3,8)?** Board shows \".\" empty! \u2714\ufe0f Safe move!\n*   **LEFT to (2,9)?** That's our own body segment! \u274c CRASH INTO OURSELVES! That's a SELF-DESTRUCT! ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n*   **RIGHT to (4,9)?** Snake #1's head is at (4,9)! If we both move there, that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83e\udd2f Both snakes die! Our scores are tied (1-1), so it's a DOUBLE KO! Is that the play? Not yet! We need to grow bigger before we force that! We want him to crash into US when we're bigger!\n\nSo the ONLY safe move right now is **DOWN** to (3,8). But is it a good move?\n\nLet's think about what snake #1 will do. His head is at (4,9). He can't go UP (off board), and he can't go RIGHT (off board). His options are DOWN to (4,8) (his own body, \ud83d\udc80 DEATH) or LEFT to (3,9) (our PREVIOUS position, which is now our body! \ud83d\udc80 DEATH for him!). Wait a minute... CHAT! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIf snake #1 moves LEFT into (3,9), which is now OUR BODY, HE DIES AND WE SURVIVE! That's the dream scenario! But we can't control his move. However, if we move DOWN to (3,8), we LEAVE (3,9) empty. If he moves LEFT, he just goes to an empty space and lives! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWe need to think about the SIMULTANEOUS move. If we stay at (3,9) and he moves to (3,9), we both die. But we can't stay, we HAVE to move. Our only move is DOWN. So we vacate (3,9). The best outcome is if he does something STUPID and crashes.\n\nOur move DOWN to (3,8) is safe and opens up future options. From (3,8) next turn, we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. We can hunt the apple at (4,6) or (2,5). We're staying agile!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** We avoided the double KO because scores are tied. Next, we need to grow! Snake #1 might be trapped on the top row. If he moves DOWN into his body, he's dead! If he survives, we need to get longer to force a favorable head-on collision. Keep an eye on the apple at (4,6) and (7,7)! Let's maneuver to cut him off!\n\nThe move is clear, chat! DOWN to live to fight another turn and set up the pressure!\n\nDOWN",
