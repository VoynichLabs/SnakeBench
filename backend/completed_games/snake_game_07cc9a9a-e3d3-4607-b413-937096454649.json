I can see two apples: (8,3) is directly above me (2 moves away), and (8,9) is far up the same column\n2. The enemy snake is at (6,1) and can potentially move UP to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,1)\n3.

If I move DOWN to (8,0), I move away from the (8,3) apple but avoid immediate collision\n\n**Analysis of safe moves:**\n- LEFT to (7,1): \n  - I move to (7,1)\n  - Enemy could move RIGHT to (7,1) \u2192 head-on collision (both die)\n  - Enemy could move UP to (6,2) or DOWN to (6,0) \u2192 safe for me\n  - Risk: If enemy chooses RIGHT, I die\n\n- DOWN to (8,0):\n  - I move to (8,0)\n  - Enemy can move UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), or RIGHT to (7,1)\n  - No head-on collision possible\n  - Safe but moves away from the (8,3) apple\n\n**Key insight:** Moving LEFT to (7,1) is risky because the enemy snake could move RIGHT to the same cell, causing a head-on collision. Moving DOWN to (8,0) is completely safe but moves me away from the (8,3) apple that's just 2 moves above me.\n\nLooking at the board, the (8,3) apple is very close and in the same column as me. Moving DOWN to (8,0) and then UP to (8,1) next turn would get me there eventually, but I'd be moving away from it now.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (7,1) risks a head-on collision if the enemy chooses RIGHT. Since I can't predict the enemy's move with certainty, I should choose the safer option.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (8,0), I'll be at (8,0) with my body at (8,1). Next turn I can move UP to (8,1) (into my old position) and then UP again to (8,2) and then UP to (8,3) to get the apple. The enemy will likely be moving around, so I need to be careful about their position when I go for the apple.\n\nDOWN\n**END NEW RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

DOWN to (7,8) keeps me in a more central position on the board with good mobility, while LEFT to (6,9) moves me further left. Given that I'm already winning by 2 apples and there's no immediate threat from the enemy snake, I should choose the move that maintains better board control and future options.\n\n**DOWN to (7,8)** is the better choice because:\n- Keeps me more centrally positioned\n- Maintains good mobility for future turns\n- No collision risk with enemy snake #0 (enemy can only move UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT to (2,3))\n- Preserves my lead while maintaining strategic positioning\n\n**Long-term strategy note to self:**\nI have a 2-apple lead (4-2) over enemy snake #0. I should focus on maintaining this lead while avoiding risky moves. The remaining apples are at (0,5), (4,7), (6,4), and (5,4). I should position myself to potentially access these apples while keeping the enemy at bay. My body is currently extending from (7,9) down to (8,6), so I need to be careful about my movement direction to avoid self-collision. The enemy snake #0 is at (1,3) with a shorter body, so they have less reach but are closer to the left-side apple at (0,5). I should monitor their movements to avoid being blocked from future apples.\n\nDOWN",

Avoids immediate death\n2. Moves closer to both (0,5) and (0,7) apples (most accessible)\n3. Opens the path to the left-side apples cluster\n4. Maintains good mobility options\n5. Keeps you at a safe distance from enemy snake #0\n6. Positions you to potentially reach an apple on the next move\n\n**Strategy note:** Move LEFT to (0,6) to maintain your 3-apple lead (7-4) and position yourself for the (0,5) or (0,7) apple on your next move. After moving to (0,6), you'll have clear paths to both left-side apples. Monitor enemy snake #0's movement (likely UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), or RIGHT to (8,6)) and continue to avoid getting cornered by your own body. Your path toward (0,5) and (0,7) remains clear and offers the most direct route to the next apple.\n\nLEFT",
