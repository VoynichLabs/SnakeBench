I'm not too close to it yet, so I need to keep moving in the right direction.\n\nI can move up to (8, 1) or right to (9, 0). Since I'm trying to get to the apple at (1, 9), I think moving right to (9, 0) would be a good choice. This will bring me closer to the apple and give me more options for my next move.\n\nStrategy: I want to keep moving towards the apple at (1, 9) and try to get as close as possible. Once I'm close, I can reassess my options and try to get to the apple or find a new direction to move in.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Since the enemy snake is moving horizontally and is currently far from my snake, I can safely move upwards without the risk of immediate collision.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: UP\n\nFor the next turn, I will reassess the board state and decide whether to continue moving towards the apple at (8, 1) or to change direction towards another apple.\n\nNext move: UP"
