UP and RIGHT would hit your own neck or be off-board.\n- There is a vertical enemy barrier along x = 6 from y = 9 down to y = 3, which blocks crossing to the left side of the board. Titans of apples are mostly on the left or bottom-right, making a direct path to apples unlikely; pursuing them would require crossing that barrier or colliding with bodies, which is dangerous.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,7) keeps you away from the enemy head and maintains two promising follow-ups (8,6) or (7,7) without forcing an immediate trap. Moving LEFT to (7,8) would quickly lead to the enemy\u2019s barrier-adjacent cells (like 6,8) being unsafe, reducing future options.\n- Plan for next turns: stay flexible, avoid entrapment near the enemy barrier, and reassess apples if any become reachable without crossing dangerous zones.\n\nLong-term plan note:\n- If a safe path to any apple opens, prioritize it while avoiding self-trap or head-on with the enemy. Maintain mobility to survive toward the turn limit.\n\nDOWN",
