Plus, grabbing that apple will grow us and set us up to start boxing the enemy in! \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f LONG\u2011TERM NOTE: Aim for (3,4) then swing around to other apples while staying unpredictable.

LEFT and RIGHT are dead\u2011ends (off\u2011board or straight into my own body), so only UP and DOWN are safe.  \n\ud83e\udd14 Which of those pushes me toward those sweet apples? The apple at (0,8) is way up the board, so moving UP brings me closer to that high\u2011value fruit and keeps my path open toward the top rows.  \n\ud83e\udd14 What about future options? After an UP move my head will be at (0,4). From there I can still go UP or RIGHT, giving me two fresh escape routes and avoiding a tight corner.  \n\ud83e\udd14 Should I start a vertical push to force the opponent into a head\u2011on clash later? Yes!

He\u2019s parked on y=5, spanning x=0\u20133. No immediate collision risk in the next move, and they\u2019re not boxed in yet.\n\nMOVE CHOICE (high-level rationale):\n- RIGHT to (5,1) is the strongest tempo move. It avoids self-collision, makes a center-line corridor, and creates potential to herd the rival toward walls later. It also keeps multiple escape routes open for future turns, which is essential for a controlling, aggressive playstyle.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Start with RIGHT to (5,1) to establish a central lane.\n- Next turns, push a combination of UP and RIGHT to extend the corridor and steer the opponent toward the board edge, aiming for a boxed, head-on window if a favorable apple count aligns.\n\nLonger-term vibe:\n- Stay alive, grow where it helps the trap (preferably near center lines), and avoid dead-ends. If the apple count flips so you\u2019re ahead, seize any head-on collision to seal the win. If not, grind the lane, control space, and force the enemy toward a wall.\n\nCurrent Apple tally: You 3, Opponent 4. We\u2019re behind on apples, so we\u2019re playing smart pressure and tight space control to flip the tempo before going for risky head-ons.\n\nRIGHT",

Since we\u2019re trailing 3-4, we should favor space and tempo over risky head-ons for now.\n\nCHOICE: RIGHT to (6,1) gives us the most breathing room, keeps options open, and positions us for a fast apple grab at (6,0) next turn if safe.\n\nPLAN:\n- Turn 13: move RIGHT to (6,1) to widen the bottom-right corridor.\n- Turn 14: if (6,0) is still available, drop DOWN to (6,0) and eat the apple to flip the pace in our favor.\n- Turn 15+: after the apple, push to extend the rightward space, avoid dead-ends, and look to herd the opponent toward walls by maintaining a wide, controlled lane while watching for a potential head-on if our apple count rises.\n- Overall: stay alive, grow where it helps trap, and only initiate head-ons when apples favor us.\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY IS HIGH IN THE CENTER, SO WE PLAY IT SAFE BUT STAY READY TO PRESS THE ATTACK WHEN AN OPENING ARISES.\n\nKEY CHECKS:\n- Left is a no-go (self-collision risk).\n- Up, Down, Right are all safe this turn; no immediate head-on with the opponent this exact moment.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (3 vs 6) and want to minimize risk while growing smartly to open future boxing opportunities.\n\nDECISION: DOWN to (7,0). This keeps us along the bottom edge, positions us to grab the bottom-row apples (notably (6,0)) on the next couple of moves, and avoids flinging into the middle where the opponent could threaten a trap. It also preserves future escape routes along the bottom and toward the right edge.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Aim to eat the bottom-row apples: first (6,0), then (3,0) if possible, to gain length and close the apples gap.\n- Use the extra length to extend potential blocking lines near the enemy, but only when it\u2019s safe and won\u2019t produce a self-trap.\n- Stay off the opponent\u2019s direct collision path; force him to react rather than us react to him.\n- If the opportunity to force a head-on collision arises and we\u2019re ahead in apples, take it; otherwise prioritize safe growth and maintaining multiple escape options.\n\nYOUR MOVE: DOWN",

DOWN is off-board and RIGHT crashes into our own neck (6,0).\n- We\u2019re choosing UP to keep our options open, stay away from the edge, and push toward the central apple clusters for growth while we pressure the middle.\n\nWhy UP (short rationale):\n- Keeps both escape routes open for the next turn (we aren\u2019t locking ourselves into a tight corner).\n- Moves us toward mid-board space where the opponent is currently cutting across, giving us chances to box him in later without risk of immediate head-on.\n- Pretend-immediate threat: we stay out of his neck zone and don\u2019t invite a risky head-on while our length increases.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (5,1) this turn and reassess after seeing his next choice (left to (6,4), down to (7,3), or right to (8,4)).\n- If he tucks left or right, we adjust to nudge him toward a potential corridor between our future body expansions and the board edge.\n- Prioritize growing when safe to do so, but avoid forcing a head-on unless we can ensure he bounces into our trap with fewer escape routes.\n\nBe sneaky, be fast, and keep the box-building eyes on him. We\u2019re not chasing apples blindly; we\u2019re boxing smart and growing for the late game.\n\nUP",

None of these hit any current body (ours or his).\n- Why LEFT now: It creates a persistent leftward corridor that hints at pinning him toward the edge over the next few turns. It also keeps us away from an immediate risky head-on with his head at (3,4).\n- How this helps the lead: By moving left, we threaten to seal off the 2\u20135 x-range and shove him into a corner. If he tries to counter from (3,4) by moving to (2,4) or (3,3), we stay flexible and can adjust to maintain the boxing lane without risking a fatal collision.\n- Risk assessment: Minimal immediate danger. A head-on collision is possible only if he chooses Down while we go Up, which is unlikely given the boxed plan. If he veers into our left-side corridor, we can adapt to keep him trapped longer.\n\nShort-term plan (turn-by-turn mindset):\n- Turn 22: Move LEFT to (2,2). Establish the leftward boxing lane.\n- Future turns: Maintain the corridor, pressure him toward the wall, and only dip to collect safe apples if they line up with safe routes. If he shifts to block (e.g., from (3,4) to (2,4) or (3,3)), pivot to keep him boxed without stepping into dangerous zones.\n- Endgame note: If we can force a head-on collision only when our apple count leads, we can swing the score. For now, safety plus lane control is the goal.\n\nNow execute:\nLEFT",

Our best bet is survival + space.

(Spoiler: my own body blocks it.)  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**:  \n- Move RIGHT to (7,9) now.  \n- Next turn, prioritize grabbing an apple near (7,8) or (8,9) while keeping the DOWN and RIGHT exits alive.  \n- Use this aggressive advance to herd opponent #0 toward the left\u2011bottom corner, forcing a head\u2011on clash when my apple count outweighs theirs.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP is a no-go (would run into your own neck at (1,6)).\n- Why DOWN? It immediately grabs an apple (apple at 1,4), boosting our apples and pushing our head toward the left-side corridor. It also keeps a clean escape route: you\u2019ll still have LEFT and RIGHT options next turn, and DOWN chains us into a longer body that can threaten in a box later.\n- Why not LEFT or RIGHT now? LEFT to (0,5) or RIGHT to (2,5) both keep us safe this turn, but DOWN gives us a direct growth bite and storage for future control along the left column. With the enemy riding high on apples (15) and us at 6, gaining on value matters more than a tight chase right now.\n- Long-term strategy note: ride the left wall, eat along the way (especially near 1,4; 1,0; 0,5 vicinity), and weave to shrink open space for him. If we can force a head-on when we\u2019re ahead in apples, we take the win; otherwise, stay alive and keep the separation while closing in on more apples to tighten the trap.\n\nSPICY Qs for the chat: can we thread him into a corner with a quick box? do we push him into our own growing tail? stay sharp, stay hungry, and keep the noise up! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Because:\n- It starts hugging the left wall, keeping options open and limiting easy pin-downs.\n- It avoids a risky head-on with the opponent while we\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 15).\n- It positions us to grab bottom-left apples later (e.g., (1,0), (4,1)) and to tighten a box from the edge.\n- We still have escape routes if he darts our way.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move along the left edge (0,4) then creep DOWN (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) to squeeze space.\n- Watch the enemy for any opportunistic head-ons, but don\u2019t chase into danger\u2014box him into tighter space later when we\u2019re closer on apples.\n\nLonger-term note for the chat: keep the chatter high, pressure him with edge control, and only commit to a head-on if we swing ahead in apples.\n\nCurrent move: LEFT\nleft",

Their path is unpredictable, but we\u2019re not boxed yet.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n- Take the apple now to gain length and keep options open for future ambush opportunities.\n- After growing, aim to maintain multiple escape routes and threaten cross-paths to force suboptimal moves from them later.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:\n- After RIGHT into (4,1), monitor their drift and look for chances to pinch space without self-trapping.\n- If they start zig-zagging toward the center-left, set up a future head-on only when you\u2019re safely ahead in apples and can survive the crash.\n\nDECISION:\nRIGHT",
