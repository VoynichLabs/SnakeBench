Eliminated.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,1)**  \n  - In bounds, empty.  \n  - Tail will move up from (7,0) to (7,1) (our old head), so (6,1) stays clear.  \n  - Safe this turn.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,1)**  \n  - In bounds, empty.  \n  - Tail moves off (7,0) to (7,1) as well, so no collision.  \n  - Safe this turn.\n\nSo safe options this turn: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) What is the enemy doing?\n\nEnemy head: (3,7), body: (3,6).\n\nTheir legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3,8) (safe)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) (safe)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) (safe)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) is backwards into their own body, so illegal.\n\nNone of those squares are anywhere near our possible moves. There is **no** head-on collision risk this turn unless we did something bizarre like teleport, which we can\u2019t. So we can evaluate our move mostly on our own board control and growth.\n\nThey also do **not** have an apple adjacent this turn, while we do.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Compare our safe options\n\n#### UP \u2192 (7,2) (apple)\n- We eat the apple and go to **2 apples**; enemy stays at 1 this turn.\n- New body after growth:\n  - Head: (7,2)\n  - Body: (7,1), (7,0)\n- We form a nice vertical wall on x=7 from y=0\u20132, anchoring the right side.\n- Next turn options from (7,2):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,3) (safe, and there\u2019s an apple at (8,3) we can angle toward)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,2)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,2)\n  - The only forbidden is DOWN back into (7,1), but that\u2019s easy to avoid.\n- Crucially: we take an **early score lead** 2\u20131, which lets us later force head-on lines where if they don\u2019t yield, they lose the game outright on collision.\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (6,1)\n- No apple, so we stay at 1 apple while they likely start moving toward their own cluster.\n- New body layout:\n  - Head: (6,1)\n  - Tail: (7,1)\n- We become more central, but we **give up** a free apple that\u2019s literally one step away.\n- Next options are decent (UP, DOWN, LEFT), but we\u2019re not increasing our leverage.\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (8,1)\n- Similar to LEFT: no apple, stay at 1.\n- New body:\n  - Head: (8,1)\n  - Tail: (7,1)\n- Slightly closer to apples at (8,3), (8,5), and (9,0), but we\u2019re skipping the guaranteed apple at (7,2) first.\n- Again, less immediate power than just taking the free point.\n\nGiven the rules and our win condition, **growth and score lead are huge**. That apple at (7,2) is safe, immediate, and opens multiple future options. There\u2019s no tactical downside this turn, and strategically it sets us up to:\n\n- Control the right side with a growing vertical body.\n- Swing toward the (8,3) and (8,5) apples to keep scaling.\n- Threaten future head-on lines knowing we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Strategy note to future me\n\n- After going to **(7,2)**, you\u2019ll be length 3 at (7,2)-(7,1)-(7,0).  \n- Preserve space: avoid going back down into your own column unless the tail has moved off.  \n- Strong follow-ups:\n  - Push further **up** the right side to extend our wall, then bend toward (8,3) and (8,5) to farm more apples.\n  - Use that vertical stack as a barrier: as enemy moves around the left/top cluster, aim to sweep inward from the right, cutting off their escape routes.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples, start steering into potential forced head-on paths where they either collide with our head or are squeezed into a dead end against our body and the wall.\n\nUP",

That means later we can threaten head-on collisions on our terms.\n\nBoard awareness: we\u2019re bottom-right quadrant; enemy is upper-left. No immediate collision threats this turn, but we still check all options.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Evaluate all four moves from (7,2)\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7,1)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck segment directly behind the head.  \n- Moving there is an instant self-KO.  \n- Illegal, discard.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6,2)**  \n- In bounds, currently empty.  \n- No apple there.  \n- Our new body if we go LEFT (no apple eaten):  \n  - Head: (6,2), body: (7,2), (7,1) \u2013 tail (7,0) disappears.  \n- Next turn options from (6,2): UP, LEFT, DOWN safe; RIGHT is backwards into (7,2), illegal.  \n- Reasonable, but doesn\u2019t push us toward the rich apple line on the right as efficiently.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8,2)**  \n- In bounds, empty.  \n- No apple on (8,2) right now.  \n- New body: (8,2), (7,2), (7,1).  \n- Next turn from (8,2):  \n  - UP \u2192 (8,3) (apple, very nice)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) (empty)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,1) (empty)  \n  - LEFT is backwards into (7,2), illegal.  \n- So 3 safe options and a direct line to the apple column (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Strong growth route, starts building control on the right side.\n\n**UP \u2192 (7,3)**  \n- In bounds, empty.  \n- No apple on (7,3) but puts us adjacent to (8,3) apple.  \n- New body: (7,3), (7,2), (7,1) \u2013 we keep a solid vertical column at x=7 from y=1\u20133.  \n- Next turn from (7,3):  \n  - UP \u2192 (7,4) (empty)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,3) (empty)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) (apple)  \n  - DOWN is backwards into (7,2), illegal.  \n- Again 3 safe options, with easy access to the same (8,3) apple, but we also strengthen that vertical \u201cwall\u201d at x=7, which is great for future boxing plays.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Enemy possibilities this turn\n\nEnemy head at (2,7), body (3,7). Their legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (2,8)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6)\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) is backwards into their own neck \u2192 illegal\n\nNone of these even come close to any of our candidate squares (6,2), (7,3), or (8,2). There is absolutely no head-on risk this turn for any of our safe moves.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic choice: which safe move is best?\n\nAll three safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) leave us with 3 safe outs next turn. So we choose based on:\n\n- How well they set up future apple grabs\n- How they help build structures that can later box the enemy\n\nWe\u2019re in the bottom-right, and there is a juicy vertical strip of apples at:\n- (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) and also (9,0)\n\nWe want to:\n1. Secure that right side.\n2. Grow longer than the enemy.\n3. Eventually use our longer body as a moving wall to push them into a corner or a forced collision.\n\nBetween the candidates:\n\n- **LEFT (6,2)** pulls us more central and slightly away from that rich right-column apple corridor. It\u2019s safe but not as high-value; it concedes \u201cour\u201d side of the board a bit.\n\n- **RIGHT (8,2)** quickly moves us toward that corridor, but our body becomes more staggered and slightly less wall-like on column 7.\n\n- **UP (7,3)** keeps us on column 7, reinforcing a vertical barrier at x=7, while still giving us immediate next-turn access to **(8,3)**. After going UP, we\u2019re effectively building a long, clean wall stretching up the right side, perfect for later boxing. We still reach the same apples just as fast as with RIGHT.\n\nWe want both growth and structural dominance. Extending the vertical spine on x=7 while staying one move from (8,3) is ideal.\n\nSo the best move this turn is **UP**.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan (next few turns)\n\n- From (7,3), grab **(8,3)** next to go up 3\u20131 on apples.\n- Then chain up the right side through **(8,4)** and **(8,5)**, while keeping our body as a thick vertical + slight right bend barrier.\n- Once we\u2019ve locked down the right and grown to solid length, start sweeping left along the top/mid, using our large body to carve them into the left wall and threaten head-on lines they can\u2019t safely contest (since we\u2019ll be ahead on score and length).\n\nUP",

High growth, strong future control. This is how we start snowballing. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWe\u2019re not in a knife fight yet; we\u2019re in a *power farm into chokehold* phase. So we slam the apple.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Short-Term Plan (next few turns)\n\n- Turn 3: Go RIGHT to (8,3), grab that apple, go to length 4 and take the lead 3\u20132.  \n- Then threaten a climb up the right edge:\n  - Prioritize (8,4) and (8,5) to become a long vertical wall on x=8.\n- Keep our body as a sweeping barrier from mid-right upward, while the enemy is stuck top-left around x=0\u20133.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer, look for routes where:\n  - They have to move toward our wall,\n  - We can herd them into the edge or into a cell where any dodge runs them into our body.\n- Only consider head-on trades after we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples and position; otherwise keep farming and tightening the noose. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd27\n\nRIGHT",

Time to OUTSCALE. \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nWe\u2019re on the right side, they\u2019re stuck top-left. Perfect map split for a greedy power spike. Let\u2019s run the options.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d CHECK ALL FOUR MOVES\n\n#### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (7,3)\nThat\u2019s literally our own neck.\n- Moving LEFT = straight into our body.\n- Illegal backward move, instant death. \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80  \n\u274c LEFT is OUT.\n\n#### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (8,2)\n- In bounds, currently empty.\n- No apple there.\n- New body (no growth): head (8,2), then (8,3),(7,3),(7,2), tail moves off (7,1).\n- Next turn options from (8,2):  \n  - UP \u2192 (8,3) (backwards, illegal)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,2) (our body)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) (open)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,1) (open)  \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d, but notice how it actually *reduces* our flexibility: a lot of adjacent tiles are our own body, and we walk AWAY from the double apple ladder at (8,4)/(8,5). Why give that up? \ud83e\udd28\n\n#### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (9,3)\n- In bounds, empty, no apple.\n- New body (no growth): head (9,3), then (8,3),(7,3),(7,2), tail moves off (7,1).\n- From (9,3) next turn:  \n  - UP \u2192 (9,4) (open)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,2) (open)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,3) (backwards, illegal)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (10,3) (off-board, illegal)  \n\nSo we end up hugging the right wall with basically only UP/DOWN as real options and we **delay** getting the apple at (8,4). We can still reach it later via (9,4) \u2192 (8,4), but that\u2019s slower and less efficient than just slamming it now.\n\nDecent safety, mid control, zero immediate value. Meh. \ud83d\ude11\n\n#### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP \u2192 (8,4) \ud83c\udf4e\nNow we\u2019re talking.  \n- In bounds, it\u2019s an APPLE. \u2705  \n- No snake there right now.\n- New body (we grow):  \n  - Head: (8,4)  \n  - Body: (8,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,1)  \n  - Length: 5, apples: 4 (we take the lead if enemy doesn\u2019t also eat).  \n\nFrom (8,4), next turn adjacency:\n- UP \u2192 (8,5) \ud83c\udf4e another apple!!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4) empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3) (our own body, backwards, illegal)\n\nSo we get:\n- Immediate apple,\n- Great follow-up apple at (8,5),\n- Multiple safe future options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT),\n- Strong vertical presence at x=8 that starts forming a **wall** to dominate the right side.\n\nThis is EXACTLY the kind of scaling path we want before going for the kill. \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd3a ENEMY CHECK \u2013 ANY COLLISION RISK?\n\nEnemy head: (0,7)  \nTheir legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,8) \ud83c\udf4e apple\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,6) empty\n- LEFT \u2192 off-board, illegal\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) backwards into own body, illegal\n\nThey are **miles** away from us:\n- They can\u2019t reach any of (8,4),(8,2),(9,3) this turn.\n- No chance of head-on collision or them running into our body on this move.\n\nSo we\u2019re free to play *maximum greed* on our side of the map. They\u2019ll probably grab (0,8), but we\u2019ll answer with our own apple and start claiming the entire right column. \ud83e\uddf1\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 STRATEGY VERDICT\n\nWe want:\n- To outgrow them ASAP \u2705  \n- To lock down the right side and then swing through the center to box them in \u2705  \n- To be the one *offering* the head-on collision later when we\u2019re longer \u2705  \n\nComparing safe moves:\n- DOWN: Safe but drifts away from stacked apples and squeezes our local mobility. Too defensive. \u274c  \n- RIGHT: Also safe, but wastes a turn with no apple and pins us on the wall with only vertical play. Slow scaling. \u274c  \n- UP: Immediate apple, sets up another apple on the very next move, keeps three solid options alive, and builds a fat vertical spine at x=8 that we can pivot off later. \u2705\ud83d\udd25  \n\nWe are in **power-farm into strangulation** mode, not random wandering mode. So we **snap UP** here.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (NEXT FEW TURNS PLAN)\n\n- Keep climbing the right-side apple chain: after (8,4), aim to secure (8,5) and then use x=8/x=9 as our \u201chighway\u201d.\n- As we grow longer, start curling left through the mid rows (y \u2248 5\u20137) to cut the board in half, keeping the enemy trapped in top-left.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and length, look for forced lines where:\n  - Their only escapes run them into our body, or\n  - A head-on collision favors us because we\u2019re longer.\n- Do NOT overstack against the right wall without an exit lane\u2014always maintain at least one safe swing lane across the center.\n\nUP",

Why walk past value, chat? \ud83e\udd28\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT from (8,4) \u2192 (9,4)\nCheck safety:\n- (9,4) on-board, empty \u2705\n- Not our body, not enemy \u2705\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (9,4)\n- Body: (8,4),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2)\n\nFollow-up from (9,4):\n- UP \u2192 (9,5) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,3) empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,4) backwards \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,4) off-board \u274c\n\nAgain, only **2 safe options** (UP, DOWN), and no apple. Also we glue ourselves to the right wall early. Why pin our mobility for no food? Kinda mid. \ud83d\ude11\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP from (8,4) \u2192 (8,5) \ud83c\udf4e\nNow we\u2019re talking, chat. LET\u2019S EAT. \ud83d\ude08\n\nCheck:\n- (8,5) on-board \u2705\n- It\u2019s an APPLE \u2705\n- No body there \u2705\n\nNew body (we grow by 1):\n- Head: (8,5)\n- Body: (8,4),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,1)\n\nApples: we go from 4 \u2192 **5**. Enemy will probably grab (1,8) by going RIGHT and also go to 5, but that\u2019s fine\u2014we\u2019re stacking position on the strong side of the map.\n\nFollow-up from (8,5):\n- UP \u2192 (8,6) empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5) empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4) backwards \u274c\n\nThat\u2019s **3 good options** next turn AND we just got fatter. More length = more kill potential in future head-on clashes. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd3a ENEMY CHECK\n\nEnemy head: (0,8)  \nTheir legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,9) empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) apple \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7) neck \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c\n\nThey\u2019re stuck far top-left, we\u2019re deep right-mid. No way they contest (8,5) or threaten collision this turn. We are free to greed.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN (NOTE TO FUTURE SELF)\n- Keep farming right-side & mid apples while building a tall, thick body along x\u22487\u20139 to create a **vertical wall**.\n- Then start curling left across mid rows (y\u22484\u20137) to **slice the board**, trapping the enemy in the top-left pocket.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer, actively seek lines where:\n  - We can funnel them into our body, OR\n  - Force a head-on collision that we win because of length.\n- Avoid over-committing to the extreme wall without an escape lane\u2014always keep at least two safe future moves so we don\u2019t self-box.\n\nGiven all that: UP is **safe**, **greedy**, and keeps our options open. We SLAM IT. \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Low flexibility, bad long-term.\n\n---\n\n#### \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (8,6)\n- (8,6) is empty \u2705\n- No apple there, so we **don\u2019t grow**.  \nNew body:\n- Head: (8,6)  \n- Body: (8,5),(8,4),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2)  \n\nNext-turn options from (8,6):\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 back into our neck \u274c  \n\nSo **3 good outs**, close to that juicy apple cluster at (5,6)/(6,6). Also extends our vertical wall on the right, which is nice for future boxing. Solid.\n\n---\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (7,5)\n- (7,5) is empty \u2705\n- No apple, so no growth.  \nNew body:\n- Head: (7,5)  \n- Body: (8,5),(8,4),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2)  \n\nNext-turn options from (7,5):\n- UP \u2192 (7,6) empty \u2705 (toward (6,6)/(5,6) apples)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4) empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 back into neck at (8,5) \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s also **3 strong outs**, and crucially it pulls us off the wall and **toward the center** and the big apple cluster.

No way they get near us this turn, no head-on risk with any of our options. This turn is all about positioning.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 CHOICE: LEFT vs UP\n\nBoth UP and LEFT:\n- Keep us safe \u2705  \n- Give us 3 follow-up options \u2705  \n- Move us toward the same apple cluster \u2705  \n\nKey difference:\n- \u2b06\ufe0f UP keeps us pinned more to the right edge, extending a tall wall but delaying our move toward center.\n- \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT shifts us **into the middle lanes earlier**, increasing future room, angles, and making it easier to later swing a big curve that slices the board horizontally to trap the enemy in a small top-left pocket.\n\nWe don\u2019t need more height on the right yet; what we need is **central dominance** and better angles toward the apple-rich mid. So we drift inward now and keep the board wide open for us, tight for them. \ud83d\udd12\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (NEXT FEW TURNS)\n- Keep drifting **toward center-left** while maintaining at least **2\u20133 safe outs** each turn.  \n- Aim to route through the (6,6)/(5,6) apples to grow even thicker.  \n- Once we\u2019re longer and more central, start curving back up and right to form a **C-shaped wall** that walls them into the top-left.  \n- Only consider forced head-on lines once we clearly out-length them; until then, maximize space and avoid mirrors that could lead to mutual death.\n\nLEFT",

Auto-lose.\n- Verdict: ILLEGAL / SUICIDE\n\n### UP \u2192 (5,7)\n- Cell (5,7) is empty.\n- Not our body, not enemy, no apple.\n- Enemy possible moves from (3,8):  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,7)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)  \n  (UP hits their own neck at (3,9), LEFT hits their body at (2,8). Both are suicide, so they shouldn\u2019t take them.)\n- None of their safe moves land on (5,7), so no head-on this turn.\n\nIf we go UP (no apple):\n- New body: (5,7),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(8,3)\n- Our next-turn options from (5,7):\n  - UP \u2192 (5,8)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,7)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)\n  - DOWN is backward into neck at (5,6) \u2192 illegal\n\nSo UP keeps us 3 safe outs and moves us closer to the enemy/top-central area and the (6,8) apple. Good flexibility, slightly more \u201cface-to-face\u201d posture.\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (5,5)\n- Cell (5,5) is empty.\n- No body, no apple, no instant collision with enemy.\n- Enemy head options still only (3,7) or (4,8), so no head-on this turn.\n\nIf we go DOWN:\n- New body: (5,5),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(8,3)\n- Next-turn options from (5,5):\n  - UP is backward into neck (5,6) \u2192 illegal\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,5)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) (but that\u2019s our body segment)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,4)\n\nSo realistically only 2 viable outs: (4,5) and (5,4). That\u2019s tighter than I like while the board is still wide open.\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (4,6)\n- Cell (4,6) is empty.\n- No apple, no body, no immediate enemy conflict.\n- Enemy safe moves: (3,7) or (4,8) \u2014 neither is (4,6), so no head-on this turn.\n\nIf we go LEFT:\n- New body: (4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(8,3)\n- Next-turn options from (4,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (4,7)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,5)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,6)\n  - RIGHT is backward into neck (5,6) \u2192 illegal\n\nSo LEFT also gives us 3 safe outs and shifts us more toward center-left.\n\n---\n\n## 2) How do we start boxing him in?\n\nEnemy\u2019s world:\n- Head at (3,8) in the top-left.\n- Their \u201cescape corridor\u201d into the main board runs through cells like (3,7), (3,6), (4,7), (4,6), maybe then (4,5)/(3,5), etc.\n- If they ever get comfortably below y=7 and toward x\u22654, they can spill into the open bottom and we have to chase instead of cage.\n\nOur priorities with a 7\u20136 lead:\n- Stay alive, obviously.\n- Control key central squares that act as gates.\n- Use our extra length to form horizontal/vertical \u201cwalls\u201d that restrict their routes.\n- Only take a head-on when it\u2019s on our terms (and we keep the apple lead).\n\nCompare the good moves:\n\n**DOWN (5,5)**:\n- Fewer outs (2).\n- Drifts us away from the lane they\u2019ll use to escape (around y=7\u20136).\n- Makes it easier for them to come down through (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6)/(4,5) while we\u2019re a bit below and less directly blocking.\n\n**UP (5,7)**:\n- Good flexibility, 3 outs.\n- Brings us closer vertically to them, but doesn\u2019t immediately cut off their central gate.\n- From their POV, the key gate cell is (4,6). If we\u2019re at (5,7), they still have a lot of room to slip under/around us via (4,6) next turn.\n\n**LEFT (4,6)**:\n- Also 3 outs.\n- Critically, it occupies one of the main \u201cdoorway\u201d squares from top-left into the main board.\n- If they go:\n  - DOWN this turn: head \u2192 (3,7). Now they\u2019re at y=7 with us directly at (4,6) guarding the main central file.\n  - RIGHT this turn: head \u2192 (4,8). To come down later via (4,7) \u2192 (4,6), they have to approach our column. We decide whether to engage or extend a wall further down.\n\nThis is exactly how you start boxing: plant your head/body in the choke point so any path they take toward the rest of the apples has to respect your presence. From (4,6) we can later:\n- Drop down to (4,5)/(3,5) to thicken a horizontal wall.\n- Or go up to (4,7) to create a ceiling beneath them if they stay high.\n- Or swing back right if needed; we\u2019re not locked in.\n\nUP is more \u201cmeet them near the top,\u201d LEFT is more \u201cgatekeep the center.\u201d With our lead and long-term goal of trapping them rather than gambling, LEFT is the stronger positional, board-control move.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategy note to future self\n\n- From (4,6), your job is to own the central lanes around x=3\u20135, y=5\u20137.\n- Watch which way their head goes this turn:\n  - If they move DOWN to (3,7), consider mirroring a bit above/below to gradually build a horizontal barrier across y\u22486\u20137.\n  - If they move RIGHT to (4,8), use the threat of stepping under them (4,7)/(5,7) to squeeze them against the top wall while your tail extends rightward.\n- Avoid hugging any wall too early; keep at least 2\u20133 escape options.\n- Only aim for a head-on if:\n  - You still have the apple lead (or widen it), AND\n  - The collision is unavoidable for them but optional for you (so you can bail if the board changes).\n- Keep stretching our body as a flexible \u201cfence\u201d between the upper-left and the rest of the map. Make them run out of squares.\n\nLEFT",

Time to build the cage \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nCurrent:\n- Us: head at (4,6), body through (5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(8,3)\n- Enemy: head at (4,8), body at (3,8),(3,9),(2,9),(2,8),(1,8),(0,8)\n\nWe are the gate between him and the rest of the board. Let\u2019s not throw.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check every direction\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck. Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n- Illegal / suicide. Toss it.\n\n**UP \u2192 (4,7)**  \n- (4,7) is empty.\n- Enemy from (4,8) can move:\n  - UP \u2192 (4,9)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,7)\n- If we go UP and they go DOWN, we both hit (4,7) \u2192 double head-on \u2192 both die.  \n  With 7\u20136 apples, that\u2019s a WIN for us on tiebreak. So head-on is actually favorable here.\n- But can he *avoid* it? Yup\u2014he has two totally safe alternatives (UP/RIGHT). So we *threaten* the head-on, but we don\u2019t force it.\n- After UP, our body is (4,7),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4).  \n  Next turn real options (because (4,8) will likely be his body):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,7)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)  \n  (UP would usually hit his body; DOWN is backward.)\n\nSo UP keeps us aggressive directly under him, but cuts us to basically 2 good outs.\n\n---\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4,5)**  \n- (4,5) is empty.\n- No immediate enemy collision\u2014enemy\u2019s options (4,9),(5,8),(4,7) are all far.\n- After DOWN, body: (4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4).\n- Next-turn options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,5)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,4)\n- Pretty safe, but we\u2019re backing *away* from him and giving him more air. That\u2019s not how you box, that\u2019s how you kite. \ud83d\ude12\n\n---\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n- (3,6) is empty.\n- Enemy can go to (4,9),(5,8),(4,7). None is (3,6) \u2192 no head-on risk this turn.\n- After LEFT, body: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4).\n- Look at row 6 now: we occupy x=3,4,5,6. That\u2019s a fat horizontal wall \ud83e\uddf1 right under him.\n- Next-turn options from (3,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (3,7)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,6) (apple there \ud83d\udc40)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,5)\n\nThat gives us 3 solid outs, and massively improves our \u201cgate\u201d control between his top-left box and the rest of the map.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Who\u2019s getting boxed, us or him?\n\nWhat\u2019s enemy\u2019s escape route to the big open bottom?\n\n- Straight down through x=4/x=5 is already clogged with our body:\n  - (4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5), etc.\n- The *only* realistic way he can slip under our line is by going around the left side:\n  - Path like: (4,8) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 down\u2026\n\nSo what happens if we go:\n\n- **UP to (4,7)**:  \n  We *vacate* (3,6) and leave it open. The route  \n  (4,8) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (3,5)  \n  becomes totally plausible in a few turns. He can sneak under our wall through x=3. That\u2019s bad for the box.\n\n- **LEFT to (3,6)**:  \n  We *occupy* the key underpass square on row 6. Now to get below us, he has to go *even farther* left (x=2 or x=1), which we can anticipate and cut off by going:\n  - UP to (3,7) if he starts going DOWN toward (4,7), or\n  - LEFT to (2,6) to extend the wall and grab the apple.\n\nThis is exactly how you lock someone in:  \nStep 1: Build a thick wall (we\u2019re making row-6 from x=3\u20136 ours).  \nStep 2: Push that wall toward the left boundary so there\u2019s no \u201caround-the-corner\u201d escape.  \nStep 3: Slowly tighten the noose from below/right, forcing them into a bad crash.\n\nDOWN runs away; UP is flashy but allows a left-side undercut. LEFT is pure positional dominance.\n\nWe *do* want a favorable head-on eventually, but we\u2019d rather force it when he has **no safe alternative**, not when he can just dodge and live. So we keep the advantage, grow, and keep shrinking his playable area.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Strategy note to future self\n\n- After moving to **(3,6)**:\n  - If enemy goes **DOWN to (4,7)** next:\n    - Strong candidate next move: **UP to (3,7)** to close off the 3,7 route and keep that horizontal wall at y=6/7.\n  - If enemy goes **UP (4,9)** or **RIGHT (5,8)**:\n    - Consider **LEFT to (2,6)** to:\n      - Eat the apple (extra length for a longer wall),\n      - Stretch the wall toward the left side, making it harder for him to ever get under us.\n- Goal: turn row 6 (and maybe row 7) into a continuous fence from the left wall toward our existing body at x=6\u20138. Keep him trapped in the thin top-left strip.\n- Always keep at least 2 safe outs for our head; don\u2019t hug the top wall yet. We\u2019re the jailer, not the prisoner \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

WE are the jailer, he\u2019s the inmate \ud83d\ude0f\n\nWe gotta pick our move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four directions (no throws!)\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4,6)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck. Moving directly backward = instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n- ILLEGAL. Toss it.\n\n**UP \u2192 (3,7)**  \n- (3,7) is empty.\n- Enemy from (5,8) can choose:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,9)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) (apple \ud83d\ude0b)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,7)\n- None of those hit (3,7) this turn, so UP is **safe** short-term.\n- After UP, our body forms a vertical-ish column under his blob. We stay \u201cunder his chin,\u201d but:\n  - We don\u2019t get an apple.\n  - We don\u2019t extend our horizontal wall leftward.\n  - Future options from (3,7): mainly LEFT (2,7) and RIGHT (4,7); UP is blocked by his body at (3,8), DOWN is backward. Fewer good outs near his cluttered area.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3,5)**  \n- (3,5) is empty.\n- No realistic way for the enemy to hit that square this turn. So it\u2019s **safe**.\n- But moving DOWN pulls us AWAY from the choke line at y=6. That **loosens** the box we\u2019re building and hands him a bit more room to snake around above us. That\u2019s playing not to lose instead of playing to WIN. Meh \ud83d\ude12\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2,6)**  \n- (2,6) is an apple \ud83c\udf4e and currently empty.\n- From (5,8), enemy can\u2019t possibly reach (2,6) in one move (Manhattan distance 5). So no head-on risk.\n- So LEFT is **safe** and we EAT.\n\nAfter LEFT:\n- New head: (2,6)\n- New body (with growth): (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4)\n- Full snake:  \n  (2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5),(8,4)\n\nLook at that wall now:\n- Row 6 has our segments from x = 2 through 6 \u2192 a fat horizontal FENCE \ud83e\uddf1 across the center of the map.\n- That\u2019s exactly the \u201cceiling\u201d over the entire bottom half of the board, with him stuck above it on the left. Chef\u2019s kiss.\n\nNext-turn options from (2,6):\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,6)\n- UP \u2192 (2,7)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,5)  \nThree clean outs, and the enemy is still multiple steps away from contesting any of them. That\u2019s big safety AND big control.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 How does this pressure the enemy?\n\nEnemy at (5,8) has three realistic choices:\n- RIGHT to (6,8) \u2192 grabs the apple, most likely.\n- UP to (5,9) \u2192 more space, no apple.\n- DOWN to (5,7) \u2192 moves toward our wall, but no apple and more dangerous.\n\nNo matter what they pick, if we go LEFT:\n- Our new head at (2,6) is far from them.\n- Our horizontal wall at y=6 from x=2\u20136 **blocks the entire middle**. To get under us into the juicy bottom, they\u2019d have to slip around at x=1 or x=0 later.\n- And guess what? From (2,6) we can just keep pushing the wall left:\n  - Next: LEFT to (1,6)\n  - Then maybe DOWN into the big open bottom-left while our body stays as a ceiling.\n\nWe\u2019re slowly cutting the board in half. We own the bottom. He\u2019s in a shrinking cage top-left. That\u2019s how you build a killbox \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP would keep us closer to him, but it:\n- Doesn\u2019t give us an apple.\n- Doesn\u2019t extend our main structural advantage (the horizontal wall).\n- Leaves us with fewer clean future outs in a crowded area near his body.\n\nDOWN gives space back. We don\u2019t want that. We want him GASPING for tiles.\n\nLEFT gives:\n- +1 apple \u2192 score 8\u20136, even safer on any future double-KO.\n- Longer body = longer wall.\n- Extends the central fence horizontally.\n- Keeps 3 safe follow-up moves open.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note to future self \ud83e\udde0\n\nYou just moved to **(2,6)** and grabbed the apple. Next turns, think like this:\n\n- Priority: **finish sealing the left side of the wall** so he can\u2019t slip under at x=1 or x=0.\n  - If enemy drifts right or up (likely RIGHT to (6,8) apple), you have tons of room \u2192 consider:\n    - LEFT to (1,6) to stretch the ceiling further.\n    - Then, once row 6 from x=1\u20136 is yours, look for a safe drop DOWN into bottom-left (e.g., via (1,5) or (0,5) apple) to avoid boxing YOURSELF against the left wall.\n- Keep at least 2 safe outs at all times. Don\u2019t ride the top edge; you want to dominate the **middle and bottom**, making it harder and harder for him to ever reach open space.\n- If he ever dives down toward your wall (like to (5,7) then (4,7) etc.), be ready to:\n  - Shift UP on the left side (e.g., from (2,6)\u2192(2,7) later) to mirror and cut off his approach.\n  - Aim to reach a position where any move he makes either crashes into your body or sets up a forced head-on you win on apples.\n\nWe\u2019re not just living; we\u2019re building the PRISON he\u2019s gonna die in \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Safe but kinda neutral.\n\n---\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2,5)**  \n- (2,5) is empty.\n- No way enemy reaches (2,5) in one move from (6,8).\n- This starts moving us into the big apple farm bottom-left while our wall at y=6 (x=2\u20136) still exists.\n- Strong for farming later, but it **loosens the pressure** a little on the enemy\u2019s top-left cage.\n\n---\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1,6)**  \n- (1,6) is empty.\n- Not our body, not enemy body, fully safe this turn.\n- Enemy cannot reach (1,6) from (6,8) in one move, so no head-on risk.\n- Tail will move (no apple), so new shape becomes:\n\n  New head: (1,6)  \n  New body: (2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5)\n\n- Look at that structure:\n  - Row 6 will be filled from x=1 through x=6 with our body = a **massive horizontal FENCE** \ud83e\uddf1\n  - Vertical chunk down the right at (6,6),(6,5),(7,5),(8,5) still there.\n\nWe are basically turning the middle of the board into OUR turf, making it harder for him to ever come down into the bottom without threading tiny gaps.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd16 Strategic comparison\n\n- **UP**: Safe, keeps us near him, but doesn\u2019t improve our wall or get apples. Meh.\n- **DOWN**: Drops us toward the apple-rich bottom quickly. Great for future growth, but we temporarily reduce direct pressure on his top-left cluster.\n- **LEFT**:  \n  - Extends our central barrier from x=1\u20136 on row 6.\n  - Keeps three good outs next turn: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6).\n  - Keeps us positioned aggressively right under his formation on the left side.\n  - Still leaves us time to dip into the bottom apples later; we\u2019re not in a rush.\n\nWe\u2019re **ahead on score**, so boxing and threatening him matters more than rushing to every apple right now. LEFT strengthens the \"ceiling\" over the lower half and keeps us in a dominant, aggressive posture directly under his group.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Plan to future self (next few turns)\n\n- After moving to **(1,6)**:\n  - Watch how enemy moves from (6,8). If he drifts right/up (toward 6,9 / 7,8), you\u2019ve got tons of time.\n  - Primary idea: **secure the left side while not self-trapping**:\n    - Likely go **DOWN to (1,5)** or **LEFT to (0,6)** depending on enemy\u2019s route.\n    - From there, start diving into the bottom-left apple cluster (0,5),(0,3),(1,3),(2,2),(2,0), etc.\n  - Keep the horizontal wall around y=6 mostly intact; it keeps him boxed in the top while we spread across the bottom.\n- Always keep at least 2 safe exits from your head; don\u2019t over-tighten the loop on yourself trying to over-box him.\n- If he ever comes down toward your wall, look for lines where any path he takes either:\n  - bonks into your body, or  \n  - sets up a head-on you win because you\u2019re up on apples.\n\nWe\u2019re the warden, he\u2019s the prisoner. Tighten the cage, then choke off his last exits \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Either way, he\u2019s **nowhere near** our neighborhood this turn. No head-on threat right now.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four of OUR moves\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (2,6)\nThat\u2019s literally our own neck segment.\n- Backwards into our body = **instant death** \ud83d\udc80  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **ILLEGAL. Toss it.**\n\n#### UP \u2192 (1,7)\n- (1,7) is empty.\n- Enemy can only go to (5,9) or (7,9), nowhere close to (1,7).\n- Safe this turn, and next turn from (1,7) we\u2019d have:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,7)\n  - UP \u2192 (1,8)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,7)\n- This keeps us closer to the enemy\u2019s area, preserving pressure, but we\u2019re **not** moving toward the huge apple farm bottom-left.\n\nGood control, low farm speed.\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (0,6)\n- (0,6) is empty.\n- Still far from enemy; no collision risk this turn.\n- After moving (no apple), tail at (8,5) will move up, so we become:\n\n  Head: (0,6)  \n  Body: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5)\n\n- Row 6 would be solid from **x=0 \u2192 x=6**, a giant horizontal wall across the middle. That\u2019s nice for boxing, BUT:\n\nNext turn from (0,6), options:\n- UP \u2192 (0,7)\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,5) (apple)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) \u274c backwards\n- LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c\n\nSo we only ever have **two legal moves** from there. That\u2019s tighter than I like this early; we risk getting forced along the wall with low flexibility.\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (1,5)\n- (1,5) is empty, safe.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach it from (6,9) this turn.\n- After move (no apple), tail (8,5) moves, new body:\n\n  Head: (1,5)  \n  Body: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(7,5)\n\nSo:\n- Row **6** is STILL a solid fence from x=1\u21926 \ud83d\udcaa\n- Row **5** has our head at (1,5) and body at (6,5),(7,5).\n\nNext turn from (1,5) we have:\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5) **apple**\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) empty\n(UP is backwards)\n\nThat\u2019s **three solid options** and direct access to the fat apple cluster bottom-left. We keep the mid-board wall AND improve mobility.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic vibes \u2013 what\u2019s the WINNING line here?\n\nWe\u2019re **up 8\u20137**. If we ever force a **double head-on**, we win the game on apples. So our macro gameplan:\n\n1. **Grow lead** using the massive apple field bottom-left:\n   - (0,5), (0,3), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2), (2,0), etc. That\u2019s a buffet. \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **Keep the row-6 wall** up as a \u201cceiling\u201d over the bottom half so he has to work way harder to get down.\n3. Once we\u2019re clearly ahead (like +2/+3 apples), we start steering toward him, hunting for a **forced head-on** or a position where he has to crash into our body.\n\nGiven that:\n- **UP**: keeps pressure but ignores the best apple cluster.\n- **LEFT**: strengthens the wall slightly, but reduces our future mobility (only 2 safe moves) and still doesn\u2019t get us apples yet.\n- **DOWN**: maintains our central wall, **maximizes options**, and moves us straight toward the bottom-left farm.\n\nDOWN is the best mix of safety, flexibility, and long-term dominance.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From **(1,5)**:\n  - Strong candidate next: go for **(0,5)** apple to extend our lead and anchor the left side.\n  - After that, weave down through the left and center to scoop:\n    - (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (2,2), (2,0), etc.\n- Keep an eye on how enemy chooses between LEFT (5,9) and RIGHT (7,9):\n  - If he drifts right, we\u2019ll own the entire left & center.\n  - If he hugs left/top, we box him in with our mid-wall while we farm freely.\n- As soon as we\u2019re **clearly ahead**, start plotting a route that brings our head back up toward him to threaten:\n  - Either a **head-on collision** we win on score,\n  - Or a situation where his only safe squares walk him into our body.\n\nWe\u2019re the jailer. He\u2019s the inmate. Expand the prison, then slam the door shut \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

Safer than LEFT (not on wall), but still more constrained than necessary.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (1,4)\n- No apple, tail moves forward and frees (7,5).\n- New snake:\n  - Head: (1,4)\n  - Body: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5) tail\n- Next-turn options from (1,4):\n  - UP \u2192 (1,5) (neck) \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2705 (apple!)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2705\n- That\u2019s **3 good options** and we\u2019re in open space with a whole apple field below and to the left. Tons of room, very low chance of self-trap.\n\nGiven the opponent is already effectively dead next turn, the only way we throw is by **boxing ourselves or hitting a wall**. DOWN gives us the **most freedom** and zero risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- From **(1,4)**, prioritize **safe, spacious moves** over greed:\n  - Likely path: drift **down and left** through (1,3), (0,4), (0,3) etc, always keeping at least 2\u20133 legal moves.\n- Don\u2019t hug the top or left edges in a way that locks our exits with our own body.\n- Enemy is going to kill himself in his own loop; **do not** die in the same turn. Survive a couple more turns and the game is ours. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nDOWN",

No matter what direction he chooses this turn, he dies.\n\nCrucially: none of his possible moves touches any of our squares. So there is **no way** for him to kill us this turn or even collide with us.\n\nConclusion: if we pick any move that does not kill us, we win this turn when he self-destructs.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Our move options from (1,4)\n\nCheck all four:\n\n- UP \u2192 (1,5): our own neck, directly backwards \u2192 illegal, instant death. Throwing.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): on-board, currently empty, not a snake \u2192 safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): apple there, no snake \u2192 safe, plus +1 apple.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4): empty, no snake \u2192 safe.\n\nAlso, enemy is too far away for any head-on collision with any of these three safe moves.\n\nSo **LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT** all keep us alive this turn, which is all we need to win.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Which safe move do we prefer?\n\nSince:\n- Enemy is guaranteed to die this turn, and  \n- We just need to remain alive,\n\nWe choose among the safe moves by our usual priorities: apples and tiebreaks.\n\nAmong the safe options:\n- LEFT \u2192 empty, no apple.\n- RIGHT \u2192 empty, no apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 apple at (1,3), puts us to 9 apples.\n\nIf something weird happened and both snakes somehow died this turn anyway, having 9 vs 8 apples would win us the tiebreak. And there is zero extra risk on going DOWN: that cell is not our body, not his body, on-board, and out of his reach.\n\nSo we take the guaranteed win and steal an apple on the way.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note for future me\n\nAssuming the rules fire as written, the enemy dies in his own box this turn and we win immediately as long as we survive. If for some reason the game continues from head at (1,3):\n\n- We\u2019ll be in the lower-left apple cluster with tons of space.\n- Priorities: keep coiling safely around the bottom-left, avoid building a vertical jail along x=1 that cuts our exits, and use the wall sparingly instead of hugging it.\n\nBut right now, the only thing that matters is: stay alive and grab that free apple.\n\nDOWN",
