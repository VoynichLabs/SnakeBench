          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Thinking Out Loud and Assessing Clearly (Current Turn):\n\nFirst, let's clearly reassess the situation based on accurate updated information:\n\nMy current position as per the last move was (4,6), and my body segments were [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)].\nI previously noted my head at (4,5) (after a LEFT move at some point), but clearly, the last move information provided explicitly states:\n\n- \"Your last move information:  \n  Direction: UP\"\n  \nThus, after moving UP from (4,6), the snake's head position is now at (4,7). This means my updated head position this turn is clearly (4,7).\n\nMy new snake body should now be [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail segments (5,4) from the earlier state would have been removed, because when not eating an apple, the tail shortens each move.\n\nVerifying this new information explicitly:\n- Snake #1 (me): Head at (4,7), body at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n- Snake #2: Last head was at (6,7), with body at (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). However, this creates a conflict as (4,7) would mean I entered a spot recently occupied by snake #2's tail. But snake #2 moved RIGHT from (5,7)->(6,7), so its previous segments were (5,7),(4,7),(3,7). After moving RIGHT, snake #2 now occupies: head (6,7), body segments at [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. Since snake #2 did not eat an apple, its tail segment at (3,7) should be removed, leaving segments [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]. Now this is crucial:\n\n- Notice, snake #2 body currently occupies (4,7). If I just moved UP to (4,7), I would collide and die immediately. The provided game scenario or your stated information is contradictory. However, since no explicit notice of collision is stated, I must assume the prior provided position of snake #2 was meant **before** my current move and before their move.  \n\nLet's double-check carefully:\n- We must trust the previous official notation provided initially at the beginning of THIS turn explicitly above all else:\n  Initially stated enemy #2 at (6,8) head, body at [(6,7),(5,7),(4,7)]. (Given clearly at the top of current board state.)\n- Given initial provided state (top explicit board layout at this turn), enemy snake #2 was at (6,8), body at (6,7),(5,7),(4,7). From that position, snake #2 moving RIGHT would mean it moves head from (6,8)->(7,8). Its body updates to [(6,8),(6,7),(5,7)]. Now it no longer occupies (4,7). This actually means my current position at (4,7) is now safe. Good clarification made here.\n\nThus, clarifying through careful reasoning the exact current accurate state after both snakes moved last turn is:\n\n- My head is at (4,7), my body segments at [(4,6),(4,5),(5,5)]. (This has clearly shifted upwards correctly.)\n- Enemy snake #2 head at (7,8), body: [(6,8),(6,7),(5,7)]. Clearly away from (4,7). (4,7) now safe for me.\n\nEvaluating surroundings from (4,7):\n- UP goes to (4,8): open and safe.\n- LEFT goes to (3,7): open and safe.\n- RIGHT goes to (5,7): NOT safe (currently occupied by snake #2's body).\n- DOWN would go to (4,6): my own recent body position, occupied by my snake and unsafe.\n\nThus, available safe moves clearly identified as UP or LEFT.\n\nRevisit apples positions clearly from current head (4,7):\n- Apples remain at: (0,1),(4,9),(2,1),(3,1),(9,0).\n- Closest apple remains at (4,9), NOW only 2 squares directly UP. Easily reachable if we continue upwards.\n\nConsidering strategic intentions:\n- Moving UP is clearly beneficial, immediately closer towards the optimal apple at (4,9).\n- Enemy snake (#2) poses no immediate risk, currently at (7,8), safely to the right and above.\n\nNext-turn reminders in strategy discussion (for later consideration):\n- Next turn continue carefully assessing surroundings and enemy movements, ensuring no sudden danger arises in the approach towards apple (4,9).\n- Remain flexible, always prepared if circumstances change (snake #2 suddenly changing paths could threaten my safe route).\n\nTherefore, the best next move, clearly beneficial in safe circumstances, is to proceed UP towards apple at (4,9).\n\nFinal Decision: UP"

After moving left, I'll be at (5, 8) and can then decide whether to go UP to reach the apple or continue LEFT depending on the board state.\n\nMy strategy for the next few moves will be to collect the apple at (4, 9) by first moving LEFT, then UP. After getting this apple, I'll reassess whether to head for the bottom left apples or the bottom right apple.\n\nLEFT"

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Thinking Out Loud and Assessing Clearly (Current Turn):\n\nFirst, let's clearly reassess the situation based on accurate updated information:\n\nMy current position as per the last move was (4,6), and my body segments were [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)].\nI previously noted my head at (4,5) (after a LEFT move at some point), but clearly, the last move information provided explicitly states:\n\n- \"Your last move information:  \n  Direction: UP\"\n  \nThus, after moving UP from (4,6), the snake's head position is now at (4,7). This means my updated head position this turn is clearly (4,7).\n\nMy new snake body should now be [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]. The tail segments (5,4) from the earlier state would have been removed, because when not eating an apple, the tail shortens each move.\n\nVerifying this new information explicitly:\n- Snake #1 (me): Head at (4,7), body at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n- Snake #2: Last head was at (6,7), with body at (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). However, this creates a conflict as (4,7) would mean I entered a spot recently occupied by snake #2's tail. But snake #2 moved RIGHT from (5,7)->(6,7), so its previous segments were (5,7),(4,7),(3,7). After moving RIGHT, snake #2 now occupies: head (6,7), body segments at [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7)]. Since snake #2 did not eat an apple, its tail segment at (3,7) should be removed, leaving segments [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]. Now this is crucial:\n\n- Notice, snake #2 body currently occupies (4,7). If I just moved UP to (4,7), I would collide and die immediately. The provided game scenario or your stated information is contradictory. However, since no explicit notice of collision is stated, I must assume the prior provided position of snake #2 was meant **before** my current move and before their move.  \n\nLet's double-check carefully:\n- We must trust the previous official notation provided initially at the beginning of THIS turn explicitly above all else:\n  Initially stated enemy #2 at (6,8) head, body at [(6,7),(5,7),(4,7)]. (Given clearly at the top of current board state.)\n- Given initial provided state (top explicit board layout at this turn), enemy snake #2 was at (6,8), body at (6,7),(5,7),(4,7). From that position, snake #2 moving RIGHT would mean it moves head from (6,8)->(7,8). Its body updates to [(6,8),(6,7),(5,7)]. Now it no longer occupies (4,7). This actually means my current position at (4,7) is now safe. Good clarification made here.\n\nThus, clarifying through careful reasoning the exact current accurate state after both snakes moved last turn is:\n\n- My head is at (4,7), my body segments at [(4,6),(4,5),(5,5)]. (This has clearly shifted upwards correctly.)\n- Enemy snake #2 head at (7,8), body: [(6,8),(6,7),(5,7)]. Clearly away from (4,7). (4,7) now safe for me.\n\nEvaluating surroundings from (4,7):\n- UP goes to (4,8): open and safe.\n- LEFT goes to (3,7): open and safe.\n- RIGHT goes to (5,7): NOT safe (currently occupied by snake #2's body).\n- DOWN would go to (4,6): my own recent body position, occupied by my snake and unsafe.\n\nThus, available safe moves clearly identified as UP or LEFT.\n\nRevisit apples positions clearly from current head (4,7):\n- Apples remain at: (0,1),(4,9),(2,1),(3,1),(9,0).\n- Closest apple remains at (4,9), NOW only 2 squares directly UP. Easily reachable if we continue upwards.\n\nConsidering strategic intentions:\n- Moving UP is clearly beneficial, immediately closer towards the optimal apple at (4,9).\n- Enemy snake (#2) poses no immediate risk, currently at (7,8), safely to the right and above.\n\nNext-turn reminders in strategy discussion (for later consideration):\n- Next turn continue carefully assessing surroundings and enemy movements, ensuring no sudden danger arises in the approach towards apple (4,9).\n- Remain flexible, always prepared if circumstances change (snake #2 suddenly changing paths could threaten my safe route).\n\nTherefore, the best next move, clearly beneficial in safe circumstances, is to proceed UP towards apple at (4,9).\n\nFinal Decision: UP"
