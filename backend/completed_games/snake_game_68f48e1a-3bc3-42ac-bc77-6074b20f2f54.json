The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8).

Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right. The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8).

Moving to (9,8) from the right is initially blocked because our head is at (8,8), and moving right would be (9,8), which is occupied by the body.

But we need to consider the other apples at (7,1) and (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (8,8) to (7,8).

According to the details: \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)] \n  So, the snake's head is at (8, 8), and its body at (9, 8). That implies the snake is oriented towards the right (since the body is at (9, 8)), but the head is at (8, 8). Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right. The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8). That suggests the snake's head is at (8,8), which matches with the move being LEFT to consume an apple at (8,8).\n\n- The opponent snake is at (4,1), not a threat at the moment.\n\n- The apples:\n  - (7,0), (7,1), (8,2), (2,1), (9,2)\n  \n  The closest apple is at (8,8), which we just ate, so now we should look for the next closest apple to continue.\n\n- Remaining apples after initial consumption:\n  - (7,0), (7,1), (8,2), (2,1), (9,2)\n\n- Our current position: (8,8)\n- The options:\n  - Moving nearby to (8,2) or (9,2) seems logical to get closer to other apples.\n  - Moving down or left would bring us toward (7,1) and (7,0).\n  - Moving towards (9,2) seems promising, as it's directly below the current position (since (8,8) is very high up), but as the y coordinate decreases, maybe better to go down or left.\n\n- Potential danger:\n  - Walls: at x=0 or x=9, y=0 or y=9.\n  - Our snake's body is only at (9,8). Moving to (9,8) from the right is initially blocked because our head is at (8,8), and moving right would be (9,8), which is occupied by the body. So, moving RIGHT is not safe.\n  \n- Moving UP: from (8,8) to (8,9) is available, but that would take us away from remaining apples and close to the top edge.\n\n- Moving DOWN: from (8,8) to (8,7), which is free, and brings us closer to apples at (8,2) and (9,2). But we need to consider the other apples at (7,1) and (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (8,8) to (7,8). That could bring us toward apples at (7,1), but that's two rows below, so maybe not optimal.\n\n- Since our goal is to collect the next nearest apple and keep safe, moving DOWN seems plausible because:\n  - It gets us closer to the apple at (8,2).\n  - It avoids walls.\n  - Our snake's body is not blocking that move.\n\n**Next move:** DOWN.\n\nI will proceed with moving DOWN.",

That implies the snake is oriented towards the right (since the body is at (9, 8)), but the head is at (8, 8). Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right. The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8).

But we need to consider the other apples at (7,1) and (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (8,8) to (7,8). That could bring us toward apples at (7,1), but that's two rows below, so maybe not optimal.\n\n- Since our goal is to collect the next nearest apple and keep safe, moving DOWN seems plausible because:\n  - It gets us closer to the apple at (8,2).\n  - It avoids walls.\n  - Our snake's body is not blocking that move.\n\n**Next move:** DOWN.\n\nI will proceed with moving DOWN.",

Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right.

Now, moving down from (9,1) would take the snake to (9,0).\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n- Moving down to (9,0):\n  - Is this safe?

The apple at (8,2) is nearby, but moving left from (9,0) to (8,0) would be closer, but we haven't moved there yet.\n- If we move right to (10,1): invalid, as the x-coordinate would be outside the grid.\n- Moving up to (9,2): currently occupied by our body, so invalid.\n- Moving left to (8,1):\n  - Is this safe? Yes.\n  - Is this closer to an apple? The apple at (8,2) is just above; moving up from (8,1) to (8,2) will get us the apple.\n\nGiven that, moving left from (9,1) is a good follow-up after moving down to (9,0).

It positions us for potential future moves towards the apple at (8,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving left now is also safe and could directly position us under the apple at (8,2).\n\nBetween moving down to (9,0) or left to (8,1), moving left seems more direct to reach the apple at (8,2). Moving down does not position us optimally toward that apple.\n\nLet's check the safety of moving left to (8,1):\n\n- (8,1) is empty.\n- No immediate collision risk.\n- Moving up from (8,1) to (8,2) will allow us to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, the preferable move now is **LEFT** to (8,1), setting ourselves up to reach the apple at (8,2).\n\nNext, the goal will be to move up to (8,2) to consume the apple, then navigate towards other apples possibly on the right side or elsewhere.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Moving to (9,8) from the right is initially blocked because our head is at (8,8), and moving right would be (9,8), which is occupied by the body. So, moving RIGHT is not safe.\n  \n- Moving UP: from (8,8) to (8,9) is available, but that would take us away from remaining apples and close to the top edge.\n\n- Moving DOWN: from (8,8) to (8,7), which is free, and brings us closer to apples at (8,2) and (9,2). But we need to consider the other apples at (7,1) and (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (8,8) to (7,8).

Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right. The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8).

Moving down does not position us optimally toward that apple.\n\nLet's check the safety of moving left to (8,1):\n\n- (8,1) is empty.\n- No immediate collision risk.\n- Moving up from (8,1) to (8,2) will allow us to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, the preferable move now is **LEFT** to (8,1), setting ourselves up to reach the apple at (8,2).\n\nNext, the goal will be to move up to (8,2) to consume the apple, then navigate towards other apples possibly on the right side or elsewhere.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Currently, I don't see an immediate opportunity to pick any of the remaining apples, as doing so could threaten my survival. \n\nInvestigating potential placements around the board while steering clear of any rival interactions should be my focus.

Moving down does not position us optimally toward that apple.\n\nLet's check the safety of moving left to (8,1):\n\n- (8,1) is empty.\n- No immediate collision risk.\n- Moving up from (8,1) to (8,2) will allow us to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, the preferable move now is **LEFT** to (8,1), setting ourselves up to reach the apple at (8,2).\n\nNext, the goal will be to move up to (8,2) to consume the apple, then navigate towards other apples possibly on the right side or elsewhere.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

That implies the snake is oriented towards the right (since the body is at (9, 8)), but the head is at (8, 8). Actually, given the positions:\n  \n  - Head: (8, 8)\n  - Body: [(9, 8)]\n  \n  The snake is extending from (8,8) to (9,8), which is to the right. The body at (9,8) is behind the head at (8,8). \n\n- The apple at (8,8) is currently at the same position as the head; that implies the last move brought the snake onto an apple. But wait, the previous move was left, which would have moved from (9,8) to (8,8), but our head is at (8,8).

But we need to consider the other apples at (7,1) and (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (8,8) to (7,8).

Given the last move was LEFT, moving from (9,1) to (8,1).  \n- The apple at (8,2) is directly above the snake's current position at (8,1). Moving UP now would directly reach the apple at (8,2).  \n- Moving left to (7,1) would divert us away from the immediate apple, so less optimal.  \n- Moving down to (9,0) seems safe but less beneficial, as it doesn\u2019t help reach an apple immediately and could risk collision if the body were to shift.  \n- Moving right to (10,1) is invalid (out of bounds).  \n\nGiven all this, moving UP to (8,2) is the best strategic choice to immediately eat the apple and grow longer, which will give more options for future navigation and points. It\u2019s also a safe move because the space above is free, and there\u2019s no risk of collision with walls or enemy snakes in that direction.\n\nNext turn, after eating the apple at (8,2), I can plan to navigate towards the next closest apple while considering safe paths and avoiding collisions.\n\n**Next move: UP**",

Considering proximity to snakes, apples, and walls is crucial, as is keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement pattern. It's also important to evaluate potential threats from the enemy snake, which I've noted as enemy snake #1 with head at (7, 3). Currently, I don't see an immediate opportunity to pick any of the remaining apples, as doing so could threaten my survival. \n\nInvestigating potential placements around the board while steering clear of any rival interactions should be my focus. My current position, after moving right, is (8,3). Moving up might put me in a position to climb for the apple at (8,7), but it also brings me dangerously close to the edge, which might trap me in the future. Moving down won't seem to be a good idea right now, as it would expose me to the enemy and possibly accidental collision. Still, moving left to the position (7,3) could put me in a line with the enemy snake, creating an inherent risk.\n\nIt seems that the best immediate move from my current position would be to move RIGHT again towards (9,3). The next step along said line could possibly bring me closer to the apple at (8,7) without directly threatening the enemy. This strategy would focus on keeping a safe distance from the enemy while simultaneously working towards collecting the apple \u2013 if possible without putting myself in harm's way.\n\n**END PREPARING NEXT MOVE**Next Move: RIGHT.",
