But since I made that move, I'm now stuck trying to eat the apple at (2, 5), and my best option for that is to move right.\n\nStrangely, I went through all the rules and my current position but my includes bits: body at [ (4,5) ], finding no collision or walls to prolong my progress. I have the best opportunity now that I've started my upward momentum on the right because the next two moves to the right I can then select either path (up or right) and try to hit another apple - all this before an obnoxious snake suddenly sets up shop on an y value similar to cors vice versa his y ship ar second path course! time trying move patterns taken heads witch.\n\n\n\nOK, time for a critical plan\n\nI think my strategy next turn will be based on the new position after this move. If I eat the apple at (2, 5), I'll grow and gain 1 point. Then I'll move to the next step.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I have three options:\n\n1. Move right to get closer to other apples at safe distances.\n2. Move up to potentially reach more central positions and prevent the enemy snake from gaining more points.\n3. Aim for the apples higher up like (0,5) and even shallow parts farther down then going further up.\n\n\n\nI think it will be a good idea for me to tell myself next turn: be patient, wait for enough new information and opportunities to cut chance for snake death from enemy counterparts; before trying climbing rate in direction places likely happening steadily falling us job how hindrition caching app/site default awarded house crappy score!\n\n\n\nI've thought this through, and I think my best move is to:\n\nRIGHT",

I've thought this through, and I think my best move is to... aim for the apples higher up like (0,5) and even shallow parts farther down. But, I'll start by getting closer to the upper right corner.\n\nHowever, I should snack on the (2, 5) apple before, I think moving up would give me a chance to get more information. It's time for me to grow and gain that 1 point. Then, I can reassess.\n\n Strategy for next turn: \"Be cautious and adaptable, consider every possible direction before making a move, prioritize growing and gaining points over immediate advancement.\"\n\nMy plan is to:\n\nLEFT \nMove directly to the the apple (2, 5). My body is currently at [ (4, 5) ], no collisions, no walls. I'm ready to grow. After eating the apple, I'll reassess and decide which direction to proceed.\n\nNo further thoughts needed.",
