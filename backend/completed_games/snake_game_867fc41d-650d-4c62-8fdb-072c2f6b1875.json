The options from (1,7) are:  \n\u2022 UP \u2192 goes to (1,8), which moves farther from (6,5).  \n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 would take me back to (1,6), essentially going \u201cbackwards\u201d into my own body, which is not allowed (or safe) since moving directly into my own tail causes a collision.  \n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 takes me to (0,7), which is moving away from the desired direction.  \n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 moves me to (2,7), a clear cell that advances my x-coordinate toward the target.\n\nMoving RIGHT sets up a path that eventually will allow me to move down and then continue towards (6,5) in subsequent moves while keeping my route free of obstacles and enemy snakes. \n\nStrategy note for future moves:\nAfter this move, I plan to navigate carefully toward the apple (6,5), always reassessing for nearby enemy snake positions and the board edges to avoid dead ends.\n\nDecision: RIGHT."

Enemy snake 1 is at (1, 7) with body at [(1, 6)].\n\nMy possible moves from (8, 4) are UP to (8, 5), DOWN to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 4), or RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\nEvaluating valid and safe moves:\n- UP (8, 5): Within board bounds, not on my current body segments [(7, 4), (7, 3)], not on enemy snake. Valid and Safe.\n- DOWN (8, 3): Within board bounds, not on my current body segments, not on enemy snake. Valid and Safe.\n- LEFT (7, 4): This square is occupied by my body segment (7, 4). Even though I am growing, this segment will still be part of my body *after* the tail (7, 3) stays put. Moving onto any body segment other than the disappearing tail is a collision. Not Valid/Safe under standard rules for growing snakes.\n- RIGHT (9, 4): Within board bounds, not on my current body segments, not on enemy snake. Valid and Safe.\n\nValid and Safe moves are UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), and RIGHT (9, 4).\n\nThe remaining apples are at (8, 8), (7, 0), (9, 2), (6, 5), and (6, 0).\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current position (8, 4) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |8-8| + |4-8| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- (7, 0): |8-7| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- (9, 2): |8-9| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Closest)\n- (6, 5): |8-6| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Also closest)\n- (6, 0): |8-6| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThe two closest apples are at (9, 2) and (6, 5), both 3 steps away.\n\nLet's evaluate my valid and safe moves towards these closest apples:\n- Moving UP to (8, 5):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |8-9| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Increases distance)\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |8-6| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (6, 5))\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 3):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |8-9| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |8-6| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Increases distance)\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 4):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |9-9| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |9-6| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Increases distance)\n\nAll three valid moves lead to a position that is 2 steps away from one of the two closest apples. Moving UP to (8, 5) moves me closer to the apple at (6, 5). Moving DOWN to (8, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 4) moves me closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nThe apple at (6, 5) is located more centrally on the board compared to the apple at (9, 2) which is near the right edge. Moving towards the more central apple generally provides more flexibility and escape options. Therefore, moving UP towards (6, 5) is a preferable strategy. The enemy snake is not currently a factor.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move UP to (8, 5), I will be at (8, 5) with my body at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]. The closest apple will then be at (6, 5). I will look for a valid and safe move that approaches (6, 5), such as moving LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

(Closer to (9, 2))\n    Moving RIGHT gets closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves reduce the distance to a closest apple. Moving DOWN leads towards the apple at (7, 0). After potentially eating the apple at (7, 0), the apple at (6, 0) is only one step away (|7-6| + |0-0| = 1). Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (9, 2). After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4. Prioritizing the path that could potentially lead to chaining multiple apples seems like a good strategy. Moving DOWN towards (7, 0) seems better for this.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away and poses no immediate threat to the potential paths towards (7, 0) or (9, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move DOWN to (7, 1), my head will be at (7, 1). The apple at (7, 0) will be one step away. My primary goal will be to move DOWN again to eat the apple at (7, 0).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Valid and Safe.\n\nValid and Safe moves are UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), and RIGHT (9, 4).\n\nThe remaining apples are at (8, 8), (7, 0), (9, 2), (6, 5), and (6, 0).\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current position (8, 4) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |8-8| + |4-8| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- (7, 0): |8-7| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- (9, 2): |8-9| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Closest)\n- (6, 5): |8-6| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Also closest)\n- (6, 0): |8-6| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThe two closest apples are at (9, 2) and (6, 5), both 3 steps away.\n\nLet's evaluate my valid and safe moves towards these closest apples:\n- Moving UP to (8, 5):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |8-9| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Increases distance)\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |8-6| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (6, 5))\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 3):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |8-9| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |8-6| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Increases distance)\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 4):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |9-9| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |9-6| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Increases distance)\n\nAll three valid moves lead to a position that is 2 steps away from one of the two closest apples. Moving UP to (8, 5) moves me closer to the apple at (6, 5). Moving DOWN to (8, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 4) moves me closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nThe apple at (6, 5) is located more centrally on the board compared to the apple at (9, 2) which is near the right edge. Moving towards the more central apple generally provides more flexibility and escape options. Therefore, moving UP towards (6, 5) is a preferable strategy. The enemy snake is not currently a factor.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move UP to (8, 5), I will be at (8, 5) with my body at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]. The closest apple will then be at (6, 5). I will look for a valid and safe move that approaches (6, 5), such as moving LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

(Gets further from (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (8, 4) to (9, 2): |8-9| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Distance remains the same to (9, 2))\n    - Distance from (8, 4) to (4, 3): |8-4| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5. (Gets further from (4, 3))\n    Moving RIGHT gets closer to none or further from two of the closest apples.\n\nMoving DOWN appears to be the better strategy to pursue the closest apples. The enemy snake is not in a position to immediately threaten either of the safe moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (7, 3), my head will be there. My tail will move from (8, 5) to (7, 5). My snake will occupy [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)]. I will find the closest safe apple from (7, 3).

My current head is at (7, 2).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (7, 0), (9, 2), (6, 0), (4, 3).\n\nCalculate the Manhattan distance from my current head (7, 2) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |7-8| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n- (7, 0): |7-7| + |2-0| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- (9, 2): |7-9| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (6, 0): |7-6| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (4, 3): |7-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe closest apples are at (7, 0) and (9, 2), both with a distance of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on getting closer to the closest apples (7, 0) and (9, 2):\n- Move DOWN to (7, 1):\n    - Distance from (7, 1) to (7, 0): |7-7| + |1-0| = 1. (Closer to (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (7, 1) to (9, 2): |7-9| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Further from (9, 2))\n    Moving DOWN gets closer to the apple at (7, 0).\n\n- Move LEFT to (6, 2):\n    - Distance from (6, 2) to (7, 0): |6-7| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Further from (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (6, 2) to (9, 2): |6-9| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3. (Further from (9, 2))\n    Moving LEFT does not get closer to the two closest apples.\n\n- Move RIGHT to (8, 2):\n    - Distance from (8, 2) to (7, 0): |8-7| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Further from (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (8, 2) to (9, 2): |8-9| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Closer to (9, 2))\n    Moving RIGHT gets closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves reduce the distance to a closest apple. Moving DOWN leads towards the apple at (7, 0). After potentially eating the apple at (7, 0), the apple at (6, 0) is only one step away (|7-6| + |0-0| = 1). Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (9, 2). After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4. Prioritizing the path that could potentially lead to chaining multiple apples seems like a good strategy. Moving DOWN towards (7, 0) seems better for this.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away and poses no immediate threat to the potential paths towards (7, 0) or (9, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move DOWN to (7, 1), my head will be at (7, 1). The apple at (7, 0) will be one step away. My primary goal will be to move DOWN again to eat the apple at (7, 0).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

My current head is at (6, 5).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (7, 0), (9, 2), (6, 0), (7, 4).\n\nCalculate the Manhattan distance from my current head (6, 5) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |6-8| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (7, 0): |6-7| + |5-0| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- (9, 2): |6-9| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- (6, 0): |6-6| + |5-0| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- (7, 4): |6-7| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Closest!)\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 4), which is 2 steps away.\n\nLet's evaluate how each safe move affects my distance to the closest apple (7, 4):\n- Move UP to (6, 6): Distance from (6, 6) to (7, 4) is |6-7| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance)\n- Move DOWN to (6, 4): Distance from (6, 4) to (7, 4) is |6-7| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1.

(Increases distance)\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 4) is the safe move that brings me closest to the apple at (7, 4).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN, my head will be at (6, 4). I will be 1 step away from the apple at (7, 4). I should aim to eat this apple next turn if it is safe. I will then re-evaluate the board state and remaining apples.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This means both moves get me one step closer to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the path from these potential next positions to the apple (4,1):\n- From (6, 1): A path to (4,1) would be (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (L then L).\n- From (5, 0): A path to (4,1) could be (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (U then L) or (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) (L then U).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves seem equally good for reaching the closest apple (4,1) in the minimum number of subsequent steps.\n\nLet's consider the second closest apples (3,1) and (5,3).\n- From (6,1):\n  - Towards (3,1): Requires decreasing x (L) and decreasing y (D). E.g., (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) or (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).\n  - Towards (5,3): Requires decreasing x (L) and increasing y (U).

E.g., (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) positions me in the same column as the apple at (5,3), offering a direct path UP towards it after the initial move. It also brings me closer to columns 3 and 4 where other apples ((3,1), (4,1), (4,3)) are located. Moving UP to (6,1) keeps me in column 6, which is further away horizontally from all the closest apples except (9,2) and (4,3).\n\nMoving LEFT also takes me away from the vertical segment of my body at x=7, providing more open space for movement.\n\nConsidering the approach to the closest apples and general board control, moving LEFT to (5,0) seems like the slightly more advantageous move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move LEFT to (5,0), my head will be there. My body will be [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)], and my tail will be at (7,4). I will then evaluate moves from (5,0), prioritizing safe moves towards the closest apple (4,1) or the nearby apple at (5,3), while considering my body position and the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

I will be 1 step away from the apple at (7, 4). I should aim to eat this apple next turn if it is safe. I will then re-evaluate the board state and remaining apples.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Moving UP to (6,1) keeps me in column 6, which is further away horizontally from all the closest apples except (9,2) and (4,3).\n\nMoving LEFT also takes me away from the vertical segment of my body at x=7, providing more open space for movement.\n\nConsidering the approach to the closest apples and general board control, moving LEFT to (5,0) seems like the slightly more advantageous move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move LEFT to (5,0), my head will be there. My body will be [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)], and my tail will be at (7,4).

After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4.

I will then re-evaluate safe moves from (4,1) based on the new apple positions and my new body/tail position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

This means both moves get me one step closer to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the path from these potential next positions to the apple (4,1):\n- From (6, 1): A path to (4,1) would be (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (L then L).\n- From (5, 0): A path to (4,1) could be (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (U then L) or (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) (L then U).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves seem equally good for reaching the closest apple (4,1) in the minimum number of subsequent steps.\n\nLet's consider the second closest apples (3,1) and (5,3).\n- From (6,1):\n  - Towards (3,1): Requires decreasing x (L) and decreasing y (D). E.g., (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) or (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).\n  - Towards (5,3): Requires decreasing x (L) and increasing y (U). E.g., (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n- From (5,0):\n  - Towards (3,1): Requires decreasing x (L) and increasing y (U). E.g., (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) or (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1).\n  - Towards (5,3): Requires increasing y (U). E.g., (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) positions me in the same column as the apple at (5,3), offering a direct path UP towards it after the initial move. It also brings me closer to columns 3 and 4 where other apples ((3,1), (4,1), (4,3)) are located. Moving UP to (6,1) keeps me in column 6, which is further away horizontally from all the closest apples except (9,2) and (4,3).\n\nMoving LEFT also takes me away from the vertical segment of my body at x=7, providing more open space for movement.\n\nConsidering the approach to the closest apples and general board control, moving LEFT to (5,0) seems like the slightly more advantageous move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move LEFT to (5,0), my head will be there. My body will be [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)], and my tail will be at (7,4). I will then evaluate moves from (5,0), prioritizing safe moves towards the closest apple (4,1) or the nearby apple at (5,3), while considering my body position and the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4.

I will be 1 step away from the apple at (7, 4). I should aim to eat this apple next turn if it is safe. I will then re-evaluate the board state and remaining apples.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

I will be 1 step away from the apple at (7, 4). I should aim to eat this apple next turn if it is safe. I will then re-evaluate the board state and remaining apples.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

My current head is at (7, 2).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (7, 0), (9, 2), (6, 0), (4, 3).\n\nCalculate the Manhattan distance from my current head (7, 2) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |7-8| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\n- (7, 0): |7-7| + |2-0| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- (9, 2): |7-9| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (6, 0): |7-6| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (4, 3): |7-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe closest apples are at (7, 0) and (9, 2), both with a distance of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on getting closer to the closest apples (7, 0) and (9, 2):\n- Move DOWN to (7, 1):\n    - Distance from (7, 1) to (7, 0): |7-7| + |1-0| = 1. (Closer to (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (7, 1) to (9, 2): |7-9| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Further from (9, 2))\n    Moving DOWN gets closer to the apple at (7, 0).\n\n- Move LEFT to (6, 2):\n    - Distance from (6, 2) to (7, 0): |6-7| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Further from (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (6, 2) to (9, 2): |6-9| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3. (Further from (9, 2))\n    Moving LEFT does not get closer to the two closest apples.\n\n- Move RIGHT to (8, 2):\n    - Distance from (8, 2) to (7, 0): |8-7| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Further from (7, 0))\n    - Distance from (8, 2) to (9, 2): |8-9| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Closer to (9, 2))\n    Moving RIGHT gets closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves reduce the distance to a closest apple. Moving DOWN leads towards the apple at (7, 0). After potentially eating the apple at (7, 0), the apple at (6, 0) is only one step away (|7-6| + |0-0| = 1). Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (9, 2). After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4. Prioritizing the path that could potentially lead to chaining multiple apples seems like a good strategy. Moving DOWN towards (7, 0) seems better for this.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away and poses no immediate threat to the potential paths towards (7, 0) or (9, 2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move DOWN to (7, 1), my head will be at (7, 1). The apple at (7, 0) will be one step away. My primary goal will be to move DOWN again to eat the apple at (7, 0).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

(Decreases distance - moves closer to (6, 5))\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 3):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |8-9| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |8-6| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Increases distance)\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 4):\n    - Distance to (9, 2) is |9-9| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2. (Decreases distance - moves closer to (9, 2))\n    - Distance to (6, 5) is |9-6| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Increases distance)\n\nAll three valid moves lead to a position that is 2 steps away from one of the two closest apples. Moving UP to (8, 5) moves me closer to the apple at (6, 5). Moving DOWN to (8, 3) or RIGHT to (9, 4) moves me closer to the apple at (9, 2).\n\nThe apple at (6, 5) is located more centrally on the board compared to the apple at (9, 2) which is near the right edge. Moving towards the more central apple generally provides more flexibility and escape options. Therefore, moving UP towards (6, 5) is a preferable strategy. The enemy snake is not currently a factor.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move UP to (8, 5), I will be at (8, 5) with my body at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]. The closest apple will then be at (6, 5). I will look for a valid and safe move that approaches (6, 5), such as moving LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

(Decreases distance to (6,6)).\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 2): Distance to (6, 6) from (5, 2) is |6-5| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5.

Moving UP to (5,4) and then RIGHT to (6,4) is a viable path. Moving RIGHT to (6,3) and then UP to (6,4) is also a viable path. Both are equally efficient for reaching the closest apple.\n\nMoving UP maintains a slightly better position relative to the apple at (0,4) compared to moving RIGHT, although the primary target is (6,6). Since both UP and RIGHT are equally effective for reaching the closest apple and safe, I will choose UP.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP to (5,4), I will reassess the board. The likely next step will be to move RIGHT to (6,4) to continue the path towards the apple at (6,6).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

This means both moves get me one step closer to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the path from these potential next positions to the apple (4,1):\n- From (6, 1): A path to (4,1) would be (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (L then L).\n- From (5, 0): A path to (4,1) could be (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) (U then L) or (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) (L then U).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves seem equally good for reaching the closest apple (4,1) in the minimum number of subsequent steps.\n\nLet's consider the second closest apples (3,1) and (5,3).\n- From (6,1):\n  - Towards (3,1): Requires decreasing x (L) and decreasing y (D). E.g., (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) or (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).\n  - Towards (5,3): Requires decreasing x (L) and increasing y (U). E.g., (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n- From (5,0):\n  - Towards (3,1): Requires decreasing x (L) and increasing y (U). E.g., (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) or (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1).\n  - Towards (5,3): Requires increasing y (U). E.g., (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) positions me in the same column as the apple at (5,3), offering a direct path UP towards it after the initial move. It also brings me closer to columns 3 and 4 where other apples ((3,1), (4,1), (4,3)) are located. Moving UP to (6,1) keeps me in column 6, which is further away horizontally from all the closest apples except (9,2) and (4,3).\n\nMoving LEFT also takes me away from the vertical segment of my body at x=7, providing more open space for movement.\n\nConsidering the approach to the closest apples and general board control, moving LEFT to (5,0) seems like the slightly more advantageous move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move LEFT to (5,0), my head will be there. My body will be [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)], and my tail will be at (7,4). I will then evaluate moves from (5,0), prioritizing safe moves towards the closest apple (4,1) or the nearby apple at (5,3), while considering my body position and the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Both moves get me one step closer to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the second closest apples (3,1) and (5,3).\n- From (5, 1): Distance to (3, 1) is |5-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2.

It also positions me further away from the main mass of my body concentrated to the right, providing more space for subsequent movement.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move UP to (5,1), my head will be there.

(Further from (4, 3))\n    Moving DOWN gets closer to two of the three closest apples.\n\n- Move LEFT to (6, 3):\n    - Distance from (6, 3) to (7, 0): |6-7| + |3-0| = 4.

This move gets me one step closer.\n- Move LEFT to (4, 0): Distance from (4, 0) to (4, 1) is |4-4| + |0-1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move also gets me one step closer.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to positions that are 1 step (Manhattan distance) away from the closest apple (4,1). Both moves get me one step closer to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the second closest apples (3,1) and (5,3).\n- From (5, 1): Distance to (3, 1) is |5-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2. Distance to (5, 3) is |5-5| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- From (4, 0): Distance to (3, 1) is |4-3| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. Distance to (5, 3) is |4-5| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 1) positions me with Manhattan distance 1 from the closest apple (4,1), distance 2 from apple (3,1), and distance 2 from apple (5,3). This move maintains good proximity to the cluster of three closest apples.\nMoving LEFT to (4, 0) positions me with Manhattan distance 1 from the closest apple (4,1), distance 2 from apple (3,1), but increases the distance from apple (5,3) to 4.\n\nMoving UP seems strategically better for accessing the nearby group of apples efficiently. It also positions me further away from the main mass of my body concentrated to the right, providing more space for subsequent movement.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I successfully move UP to (5,1), my head will be there. My body will be [(5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)]. My tail will be at (7,3). I will then evaluate moves from (5,1), prioritizing the closest apple (4,1) while considering my body position and the enemy snake. A likely next move would be LEFT to eat the apple at (4,1).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

After potentially eating the apple at (9, 2), the next closest apple is (7, 0) at a distance of 4.
