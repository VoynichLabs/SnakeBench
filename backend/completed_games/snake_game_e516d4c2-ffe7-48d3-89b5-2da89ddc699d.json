Time to think fast and act faster. \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick situational read:\n- Board 10x10. I'm at (2,5). Enemy head at (3,3). Both of us length 1, 0 apples.\n- Nearby apples: (1,5) is right next to me (LEFT). There's also (2,7) above me (UP two steps).\n- No bodies to worry about right now, and no immediate off-board danger.\n\nEvaluate all four moves (HEAD-TO-TAIL safety check first):\n- UP -> (2,6): safe. Moves toward apple at (2,7) in two turns, keeps options open. Neutral play.\n- DOWN -> (2,4): safe. Closes distance to enemy (he's at (3,3)) \u2014 more aggressive but not gaining apples immediately.\n- LEFT -> (1,5): safe. There's an apple on that square. Grabbing it gives us +1 apple and immediate growth (length 2) and a scoring advantage. How sweet is that? \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT -> (3,5): safe. Puts us directly above the opponent's column (x=3). Could be used to pressure, but doesn't get an apple and could let him slip by.\n\nRisk of head-on this turn? Negligible \u2014 the opponent is two rows down; no single-move collision risk no matter which move I pick. The important tactical goal: get the lead so we can safely force head-ons later. Want to be aggressive? Yes \u2014 but smart aggression: get the apple and then box.\n\nShort-term plan / strategy note (for next-turn rationale):\n- Grab the apple at (1,5) now to go up 1-0. Grow to length 2 and use the extra body to threaten and cut off escape routes.\n- Next turns: pressure the enemy from above/left, try to funnel him toward the board edge or into my body. Once I'm ahead in apples, be willing to force a head-on if he attempts to run through me.\n- Avoid chasing blindly into narrow corridors; keep multiple escape options open.\n\nMy move: take the apple, get the lead, and start dominating. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Keeps escape routes open (can go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN next). More conservative, not immediately threatening him.\n- DOWN -> (2,3): safe. Conservative; draws distance from him and doesn\u2019t pressure.\n- LEFT -> (1,4): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s directly into the segment behind our head (backwards). Auto-death. NOPE.\n- RIGHT -> (3,4): safe and aggressive. Closes the gap to the opponent at (5,4). Preserves multiple follow-ups (RIGHT to (4,4) to attempt a head-on next turn, or UP/DOWN to cut him off). Best for forcing a confrontation since we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- Opp might avoid us by moving UP/DOWN; that ruins the instant head-on plan but still leaves us well-positioned to chase and cut him off.\n- If he responds by moving LEFT into (4,4) while we then move RIGHT into (4,4) on the following turn, both heads enter the same cell and both die \u2014 but we win the game because we have more apples (2 vs 0). That\u2019s an acceptable outcome if he tries to meet us.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps options open and keeps pressure. It\u2019s the play that maximizes chances to force a win while not walking into any immediate death.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will become the rationale on the next turn):\n- Keep moving RIGHT to close the lane. If he lunges left to meet us, accept/force the head-on (we\u2019re up on apples).

Time to think like a predator, not a pacifist.\n\nQuick move scan from head (4,4):\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4): illegal (that\u2019s our neck). No backward BS. \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4): aggressive, gets into the opponent\u2019s column (good pressure). Leaves us with only forward/right/down on the next turn (can\u2019t go back), so slightly restrictive.\n- UP \u2192 (4,5): aggressive but keeps max options (we can go UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn). Moves us closer to the rival\u2019s space without cornering ourselves. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3): safe but retreats \u2014 less aggressive, gives opponent room to breathe. \ud83d\ude12\n\nOpponent facts: head at (5,6), body at (5,5). They CANNOT move DOWN (that\u2019d be backwards into (5,5)). Their realistic moves this turn are UP (5,7), LEFT (4,6) or RIGHT (6,6). We want to pressure and possibly force a head-on or a bad escape. Since we lead on apples, forcing a collision is okay \u2014 but we still prefer to keep escape routes open in case they snake us.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- RIGHT is tempting (direct pressure), but it reduces our follow-ups (we\u2019d lose the ability to go back next turn). That could get us boxed if they jukes smartly.\n- UP keeps more options and still nudges toward their area so we can pivot to cut them off next turn. It also preserves the possibility of baiting them into moving into our body or into a head-on.\n\nPlan for next few turns (notes to self):\n- Press into column 4\u20135 corridor. If they go LEFT to (4,6), we follow UP to (4,6) to threaten a head-on or force them into the top wall. If they run UP/RIGHT, chase and use our slightly longer length to hem them toward the edge. Accept a head-on if simultaneous \u2014 apples are on our side. Stay flexible; avoid getting trapped by committing to the 5-column too early.\n\nLet\u2019s be loud, be dumb in the right way, and bully him back into the wall. You know the vibe. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Safe, but DOWN from there (3,7) is our body \u2014 fewer safe follow-ups.\n\n2) Opponent head (7,8) threat scan:\n- They cannot go UP (7,9) or LEFT (6,8) \u2014 both occupied by their body. Their realistic moves this turn are RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) (apple) or DOWN \u2192 (7,7). Neither is near us this turn.

Best branching and immediate apple access to start closing the score gap.\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) gives 2 follow-ups (1,9 & 3,9). Good space but slower to the apple cluster at 0,x.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) has limited follow-ups because DOWN is occupied by our body at (3,7) and LEFT would be backward into (2,8). Only 2 safe options.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (1,8) \u2192 next turn grab 0,8 (LEFT again) and then 0,9 to equalize and regain board control. Once we hit parity or get ahead, sweep east along the top row to pressure #0 and try to corral them toward a wall or force a head-on only if we\u2019re up in apples.

That cell is currently occupied by our own body segment, so moving up = instant self\u2011kill. Nope, not an option.  \n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT** \u2013 moves us to (7,7). Safe from self\u2011collision and off\u2011board, but it drifts us away from the nearest apples (8,6) and (9,7). It also puts us deeper into the left wall corridor, which could box us in later.  \n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT** \u2013 jumps to (9,7), which is an apple spot \ud83c\udf4e. It\u2019s safe from our own body, but we\u2019d be hugging the right edge, limiting future flexibility. Plus, we\u2019d be moving farther from the opponent on the left side, making a head\u2011on collision less likely in the short term.  \n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN** \u2013 slides us to (8,6). That cell is an apple (8,6) listed in the drop pool, so we\u2019d eat it, grow, and stay alive. It\u2019s also adjacent to another upcoming apple (9,7) and keeps us in the middle of the board, preserving multiple escape routes. Most importantly, it doesn\u2019t intersect any probable opponent head position this turn (opponent likely heading up to (0,9) or down to (0,7)).  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Long\u2011term game plan**:  \n- Grab (8,6) now \u2192 grow longer.  \n- Next turn head toward (9,7) to secure that apple and start curving leftward.  \n- Use the enlarged body to cut off Snake #1\u2019s path, forcing a head\u2011on crash.  \n- Keep the board open, avoid the left wall, and continuously pressure the rival.  \n\nGiven all that, the smartest aggressive bite is clearly **DOWN**.  \n\nDOWN",

No.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8): into our neck = backwards = illegal. No.\n- UP \u2192 (0,9): apple! On-board and safe this turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7): empty and safe.\n\nHead-on risk: opponent head is at (8,7) \u2014 nowhere near us this turn, so no immediate head-to-head threat. But they\u2019re up on apples (7 vs our 5), so we should avoid risky trades until we\u2019ve closed the gap.\n\nFollow-up mobility:\n- If we go UP to (0,9) we grab an apple (+1) \u2014 nice \u2014 but we get boxed to one non-backwards follow-up. After eating, (0,8) becomes our neck, so next turn the only legal move besides illegal/backwards or off-board would be RIGHT to (1,9). That's a single forced path \u2014 risky if the board gets crowded.\n- If we go DOWN to (0,7) we skip the immediate apple but keep multiple safe exits (RIGHT to 1,7 or further DOWN). That preserves flexibility to roam and react to the opponent, avoid being corralled, and set up safer apple runs next turns.\n\nTactical read: we\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 want to be aggressive, but not trapped into a single forced line that the bigger opponent could exploit later. Take mobility over one apple this turn; keep options open to circle, pressure mid-board, and pick apples when we can secure escape routes. Play to avoid head-on until we have the lead.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to maintain freedom. Then push right/down to pick up nearby apples while staying out of narrow corridors. Once we secure parity or a lead, start squeezing #0 toward cramped zones and force risky collisions.\n\nLET\u2019S KEEP OUR OPTIONS AND STAY ALIVE \u2014 GO HARD NEXT TURNS.\n\nDOWN",

Too narrow \u2014 traps us quickly. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,5) = safe and moves toward apples (1,4 / 1,0).

No immediate head-on risks. We\u2019re behind 5\u21929, so DON\u2019T force a suicidal head-on. We want growth and space control.\n\nWhy RIGHT? Because we need options. RIGHT to (2,6) preserves three follow-ups (UP to 2,7, DOWN to 2,5, RIGHT to 3,6), keeps us moving toward the board center and the mid/bottom apples (like 3,5), and avoids getting locked into our own hook on the left. More options = better ability to box them later. Want to bait them into the cramped top-right? We\u2019ll corral them from the center once we\u2019ve grown and taken those mid apples. Sound plan? Let\u2019s be ruthless. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Sweep the central/bottom apples safely to close the score gap while maintaining mobility.\n- Force opponent into the tight top-right corridor by claiming center lanes and denying escape routes.\n- Avoid head-on until we\u2019re at least even or can guarantee we win a collision.

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nCurrent facts:\n- Our head: (3,6). Neck: (2,6) \u2192 LEFT is illegal (would bite our neck). Don\u2019t be that guy. \ud83d\udeab\n- Opponent head: (8,2) with a long body locked into the top-right (mostly column 8 + some in 6\u20137,8\u20139). They\u2019ve got 10 apples; we\u2019ve got 5. They\u2019re ahead \u2014 avoid an early head-on unless we can guarantee a KO. \ud83e\udde0\n- Nearby apple at (3,5) is right below us. Grabbing apples to close the gap is smart, but we must keep escape options open.\n\nConsider moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 illegal (neck). Auto-ban.\n- UP \u2192 (3,7): safe, multiple follow-ups, keeps distance. No apple this turn. Good space-control play but slower on apples.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6): safe, center control, keeps options open. Again no immediate apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5): safe AND lands an apple immediately. Growth +1 apple (we go 6 vs their 10). After eating, we still have multiple exits (2,5 / 4,5 / 3,4) \u2014 not a trap. No immediate head-on risk (opponent too far to contest that cell). This is high-value: we get apples and maintain mobility.\n\nThreat check:\n- Opponent could head toward (8,1) or (7,2) next, not anywhere near us. No simultaneous head collision risk on (3,5).\n- Because opponent leads on apples, we avoid trying to force a head-on. We prioritize safe growth and building board control to eventually box them into top-right.\n\nShort long-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 will appear as next-turn rationale):\n- Secure (3,5) now to shrink the apple gap and add length.\n- Use the new length to control the central columns (3\u20135), aim to cut off their exits from the upper-right without ever committing to a risky head-on while they\u2019re still ahead.\n- If we can reliably corral them toward the wall and increase apples so we surpass them, then look for a head-on gamble only when apples favor us.\n\nWe want aggressive growth with options open \u2014 apple + mobility is the play. Let\u2019s eat and keep plotting.\n\nDOWN",

Quick brain-dump and then we MOVE.\n\nBoard facts (fast):\n- Our head: (2,5). Neck: (3,5) \u2192 RIGHT is moving into neck = illegal. \ud83d\udeab\n- Our body occupies (2,6), (3,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) \u2014 UP \u2192 (2,6) = collision with our body = illegal. \ud83d\udeab\n- So the ONLY safe immediate moves are LEFT \u2192 (1,5) and DOWN \u2192 (2,4). Both are legal and both set up the nearby apple at (1,4) next turn.\n- Opponent head is way over at (6,2) \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn. They can\u2019t contest the (1,4) apple this turn.\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- LEFT to (1,5): sets up DOWN to (1,4) apple next turn. After LEFT we\u2019ll have 2 good follow-ups (LEFT or DOWN). Slightly hugs the left wall \u2014 aggressive positioning to lock columns 0\u20134.\n- DOWN to (2,4): also sets up LEFT to (1,4) apple next turn. From (2,4) we keep three follow-ups (LEFT to apple, RIGHT into open space, or DOWN) \u2014 more central and gives more escape routes after the apple. Safer while still being aggressive.\n\nTactics & priority:\n- We\u2019re down by 4 apples (7 vs 11). Need to grow fast but not suicide. Take the (1,4) apple on the next turn \u2014 it\u2019s reachable either way.\n- Prioritize maintaining multiple escape routes so we don\u2019t get boxed by our own body or a future opponent push.\n- Be ready to convert growth into board control across x=0..4 columns \u2014 but don\u2019t hug the wall too early if it reduces options.\n\nDecision: Take the safer, more flexible route \u2014 move DOWN to (2,4). Keeps us central, leaves LEFT next turn to grab the apple at (1,4) safely, and preserves multiple exits so we can pivot to trap the enemy later. Let\u2019s grow without choking ourselves. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re down 8 \u2192 12 apples, so we want apples but we can\u2019t suicide for them.\n\nOptions:\n- UP \u2192 (1,5): Instant apple! +1 apple, nice. BUT that move is VERY constraining: after eating, UP will leave only LEFT as a safe follow-up (RIGHT = our body at (2,5), UP = (1,6) is our body, DOWN = neck). That single forced path could get us boxed later.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): No apple immediately, but it keeps 3 safe follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Much more flexible and preserves escape routes while we close the gap on apples over the next few turns.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): Safe and moves toward the left side; moderate flexibility but fewer immediate apple options than DOWN.\n- RIGHT \u2192 illegal (back into neck) \u2014 DO NOT.\n\nDecision: take the safer, flexible play \u2014 we need options more than a single apple right now. DOWN keeps us alive and adaptable to enemy movement, still lets us chase low-left apples (0,1 / 0,0 / 1,0 / 2,0 / 3,0) in a controlled way and avoids getting forced into a tight corridor where the opponent can trap us. We\u2019ll be aggressive but not reckless.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (1,3) to retain maneuverability.\n- Then pivot LEFT and sweep the bottom-left apples (1,0; 0,1; 0,0; 2,0; 3,0) to quickly close the score gap while staying out of the opponent\u2019s right-side domain.\n- Avoid committing to narrow vertical stacks; if we get ahead on apples, start pressuring center-right to bait a head-on when it favors us.\n\nLet\u2019s bait, grow, and then box \u2019em \u2014 this is how we win.

Neck at (1,3) \u2192 UP is illegal (would bite ourselves).\n- Occupied by bodies: our own segments at (1,3),(1,4),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(1,6). Opponent occupies (3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(5,2),(6,2),(7,2),(8,2),(8,3),(8,4),(8,5),(8,6),(8,7),(8,8),(7,8).\n- Opponent head (3,1) cannot reach our immediate adjacent squares this turn, so no instant head-on danger.\n\nMove breakdown:\n- UP \u2192 illegal (back into neck).\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2) is empty, but moving there leaves only 2 good follow-ups (UP or DOWN) \u2014 tight against the wall.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) is empty and gives access to (3,2) apple next turn, BUT that puts us next to the opponent head at (3,1) and risks a contested head-on on their apple. We\u2019re behind on apples (8 vs 13) \u2014 don\u2019t force a risky head-on.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1) is empty, keeps three safe follow-ups (LEFT to 0,1 apple, DOWN to 1,0 apple, RIGHT to 2,1), keeps mobility high and pushes toward the bottom-left apple cluster while avoiding immediate clashes.\n\nWhy DOWN:\n- Maximizes escape options (3 safe choices next turn).\n- Advances toward reachable apples in the lower-left without walking into a trap or a direct contest with the opponent head.\n- Keeps us flexible to box the opponent later if they commit to the right side.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Sweep bottom-left apples (1,0 \u2192 0,1/0,0/2,0) while keeping at least two escape options each turn.\n- Avoid taking the apple at (3,2) if the opponent signals a contest \u2014 we don\u2019t want a head-on while behind on apples.\n- If the opponent pushes into the bottom too aggressively and leaves a flank open, pivot and cut them off. Otherwise, consolidate space and farm safely until we can force a favorable head-on.\n\nLet\u2019s keep our body alive and hustle for content \u2014 DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Plus, the opponent can\u2019t reach (3,0) in one step, so no head\u2011on collision risk.  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Grab the (3,0) apple now to boost our apple count and length.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn consider moving **UP** to (3,1) \u2013 that opens a fresh corridor and keeps us out of the opponent\u2019s tiny \u201ctunnel\u201d.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the pressure on Snake #1 by slowly expanding upward and to the right, forcing them into a corner.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Stay alert for any chance of a head\u2011on clash; if they try to cut us off, we can pivot and trap them instead.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **Rhetorical Question**: Should we keep the aggression and keep growing, or play it safe and back off? The answer is clear \u2013 we\u2019re already ahead, let\u2019s dominate!  \n\nRIGHT",

Neck = (1,1) \u2192 UP is illegal (would bite neck).\n- At y=0 \u2192 DOWN is off-board \u2192 illegal.\nSo only LEFT or RIGHT are legal this turn.\n\nConsider all four:\n- UP \u2192 illegal (into our neck at (1,1)).\n- DOWN \u2192 illegal (would go off the board).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,0) \u2014 currently occupied by opponent head. Technically we\u2019d be moving into their head cell; because moves are simultaneous this can be a swap or safe if they move elsewhere, but it\u2019s a contested space and we\u2019re behind on apples (9 vs 14) \u2014 don\u2019t want to gamble on a risky head contest unless we have the edge.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,0) \u2014 apple. Legal, we eat and GROW this turn (tail will NOT move), meaning our previous head cell (1,0) becomes a permanent body segment this turn.\n\nWhy LEFT is the killer play:\n- Immediate apple growth = we close the apple gap and get content.\n- Because we grow, (1,0) remains occupied by our body after the move. If the opponent tries to respond by moving LEFT into (1,0) (their natural aggressive option), they will move into OUR body and die. That\u2019s a bait/trap right in front of them.\n- LEFT keeps options to climb up the left column (0,1) and then sweep the bottom-left zone. Yes, wall-adjacent but growth gives us blocking leverage to box and force mistakes.\n- RIGHT is safer in terms of not hugging the wall, but it\u2019s a contested head zone and we\u2019re trailing on apples \u2014 we should force their mistake, not trade heads.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Take (0,0) now to grow and threaten a one-turn kill if they push into (1,0).\n- If they avoid the trap and go for (3,0)/(2,0) instead, use the extra length to cut across/up the left side (0,1 \u2192 0,2\u2026) and try to funnel them along row 1 where their long body gives us choke points.\n- Maintain at least two escape options each turn; don\u2019t willingly head-on unless apples favor us later. Be greedy, be smart, and let them run into our wall.\n\nLet\u2019s bait and grow. LEFT",

That\u2019s a one\u2011way ticket to a tight corner \u2013 not ideal for future flexibility.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,\u202f1)** \u2013 Oops, that\u2019s our own body segment! Stepping backwards into ourselves = instant KO. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,\u202f1)** \u2013 Off\u2011board death. \u274c  \n\nSo the only viable moves are **UP** or **DOWN**.  \n\nNow, which one keeps *multiple* safe exits open?  \n\n- From (9,\u202f2) we can still go **UP** again later, or even **LEFT** after a couple of moves once our tail has cleared, giving us a branched path toward those juicy apples at (9,\u202f4) and (9,\u202f5).  \n- From (9,\u202f0) the only safe next step is **LEFT** to (8,\u202f0) \u2013 a dead\u2011end unless we want to gamble on that apple. After eating it we\u2019ll be stuck with limited room to maneuver, and the opponent is still lurking on the left side, ready to cut us off.  \n\nWe\u2019re ahead in apples (18 vs\u202f11) \u2013 it\u2019s *our* moment to stretch that lead, not to crawl into a corner.  \n\n**APPLE HUNTER ALERT:** (9,\u202f4) and (9,\u202f5) are just two ups away, and they\u2019re prime real estate. Snatching them now will not only boost our score but also let us seal off the east corridor, making it harder for Snake\u202f#1 to slip through.  \n\n**LONG\u2011TERM PLAN (for future me):**  \n- Turn\u202f34: move **UP** to (9,\u202f2).  \n- Turn\u202f35: another **UP** to (9,\u202f3).  \n- Turn\u202f36: **UP** to (9,\u202f4) \u2192 eat apple, grow, keep the momentum.  \n- Then swing **UP** to (9,\u202f5) for the second apple, and start sweeping leftward to trap the rival.  \n\nAll signs point to **UP** as the smartest, safest, and most aggressive choice right now.  \n\nUP",

Keeps the left-column wall and preserves the \u201ctop cut\u201d plan. \u2705\n\nWhy UP (short & loud):  \nWe\u2019re down on apples (11 vs 18) so we DON\u2019T want to gamble on a risky center engagement or an accidental head-on. Staying on the left column (UP) preserves territorial leverage \u2014 we keep the wall intact so we can later swing right from a high Y and try to trap or hem-in #0. RIGHT is safe now, but it peels us off the wall and gives the rival more room to snake past; that\u2019s not what we want when we\u2019re baiting a box. UP keeps options open and forces them to commit to the cluttered right/bottom. \ud83d\ude08\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRisk check: opponent\u2019s head is at (9,1) \u2014 far from immediate collision. No imminent head-on if we go UP. Eating soon (at 0,9) is fine strategically \u2014 growing while holding the wall helps seal lanes for them later.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):  \n- Climb: 0,7 \u2192 0,8 \u2192 0,9 (take the apple at 0,9), cement the top-left corner.  \n- Then swing right along y=9 (via 1,9 / 2,9) to start slicing across the board from above, forcing #0 to stay low/right or risk collision.  \n- Avoid going center-heavy early; only contest apples when they create or secure a trap. Stay alive, keep options, bait them into cramped paths. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udccd\n\nUP",

Quick, clean read:\n\nLegal move check (HEAD: (0,8))\n- LEFT \u2192 (\u22121,8): off the board = instant death. NOPE. \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7): our neck / backwards into our body = illegal. NOPE. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8): empty and safe this turn. \u2714\ufe0f  \n- UP \u2192 (0,9): apple at (0,9) \u2014 safe and growth. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nRisk assessment & strategy shout:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (11 vs 18). We DO NOT want to gamble on a risky head-to-head. Avoid forcing a head-on. \ud83e\udde0  \n- Opponent head at (9,2) is far \u2014 no immediate head-on threat if we take the apple above us.  \n- Staying on the left wall and snagging the apple at (0,9) preserves board control: we can then sweep right along y=9 to start hemming them into the lower/right half. Growth + wall = leverage. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (next ~3\u20136 turns):\n- Take (0,9) now \u2192 grow and lock top-left.  \n- Then push right along the top row: 1,9 \u2192 2,9 (there\u2019s an apple at 2,9) to maximize apples while keeping the wall behind us.  \n- Use the high row to slice across and force #0 into tighter lanes; only commit center if we have clear numerical/apple advantage or a guaranteed head-on win.\n\nWhy UP over RIGHT?\n- RIGHT is safe now but peels us away from the wall and gives the rival more escape lanes. UP gets us immediate content (apple) and keeps the \u201ctrap\u201d geometry intact. Apples + position > risky central skirmish while behind on score.\n\nStay aggressive, but don\u2019t suicide for style. Time to collect and close the net. \ud83e\udd77\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Snatching (9,\u202f4) will push me past 20 apples, cementing a massive lead over Snake\u202f#1 (12).  \n\n- Eating that apple will also grow my length, turning my tail into a moving barrier that can start pinching Snake\u202f#1 from the east side. Once my tail clears, I\u2019ll have multiple escape routes (UP, LEFT, or RIGHT later).  \n\n- Moving LEFT would open a corridor but doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apple and might box me into a narrower region sooner.  \n\n- Safety check: both UP and LEFT keep me alive this turn, but only UP promises an immediate apple and sets up a longer\u2011term squeeze.  \n\n**LONG\u2011TERM PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS**  \n- **Turn\u202f36:**\u202fUP to (9,\u202f4) \u2192 eat apple, grow, lock the east corridor.  \n- **Turn\u202f37:**\u202fUP to (9,\u202f5) \u2192 grab the second apple, then pivot leftward to start the squeeze.  \n- After that, use the freshly\u2011grown tail as a wall to trap Snake\u202f#1 while I keep hunting the remaining apples.  \n\nAll signs point to **UP** as the aggressive, safe, and apple\u2011rich choice.  \n\nUP",

Keep options open and force them into tighter corridors.\n\nShort-term plan (next ~3\u20136 turns):\n- Take (1,9) now \u2192 then go to (2,9) apple to grow.  \n- After securing top apples, sweep right along y=9 to pressure them into the lower-right area, then curve down to cut off escape lanes.  \n- Avoid head-on collisions unless we have the clear numeric/apple advantage or can guarantee they move into our body.

The board\u2019s a battlefield, but the clues are clear: our head\u2019s at (9,6) and the only safe neighbors are UP (9,7) and LEFT (8,6).  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Immediate danger check:  \n- DOWN would plunge us into our own body \u2192 instant KO.  \n- RIGHT is a wall\u2011bang off\u2011map \u2192 RIP.  \n- Moving into any other snake\u2019s body? Not happening \u2013 their heads are nowhere near us.  \n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple radar: (9,7) is literally buzzing right above us, a free bite that\u2019ll push us past the 30\u2011apple win line faster. Grabbing it also forces the opponent to chase us from the opposite side, setting up a perfect head\u2011on trap later.  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f Opponent vibes: Snake\u202f#1 is crawling along the left\u2011top edge, but they\u2019re hemmed in by their own tail and the top wall. If we shoot up, they\u2019ll have to hustle to stay relevant, and any aggressive move on their part could land them straight into our expanding coil.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan:  \n- Eat the (9,7) apple this turn to grow and boost the lead.  \n- Next turn pivot left to start a vertical wall that can slice off the rival\u2019s escape routes.  \n- Keep the east side open for future squeezes while staying far from dead\u2011ends.  \n\nUP",

Fans are LOUD, we\u2019re hungry, and it\u2019s TIME to pounce. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick check (from head at 2,8):\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) is our neck (2,9) \u2192 illegal/backwards \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) safe but no apple; keeps flexibility \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) safe but no immediate apple \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) has an apple \u2014 we can GROW and deny the enemy \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSafety vs enemy: opponent head at (9,6) is far. They can likely go UP to (9,7) apple or LEFT to (8,6). No realistic head-on threat this turn. So we should prioritize eating since we\u2019re down 14\u219220 and need to close the gap.\n\nTradeoffs:\n- RIGHT gives more immediate mobility (more follow-up options), but no apple \u2014 slower to close the score gap.  \n- DOWN is safe but also passive.  \n- LEFT gets the apple at (1,8) now. After moving LEFT, many adjacent cells are occupied by our body: UP (1,9) occupied, LEFT (0,8) occupied, RIGHT (2,8) becomes the new neck (so moving back is illegal). That means after grabbing (1,8) our immediate follow-up will almost certainly be DOWN to (1,7). Yes it narrows options, but it chains into the 1-x column apples (we can target (1,5),(1,4),(1,3) later) and gives us length to start corralling space. Growing now is high value \u2014 we need apples and we\u2019re not forcing a head-on while trailing.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- LEFT to eat (1,8) now \u2192 DOWN to (1,7) next turn to avoid getting boxed.  \n- Chain down column for the (1,5)/(1,4)/(1,3) apples if safe, growing our wall.  \n- Once longer, start sweeping right along mid/upper rows to hem #0 into the bottom-right corridor. Avoid head-on until we surpass them in apples.\n\nWe\u2019re grabbing content and building the barbed wire \u2014 play smart, stay alive, force the enemy into cramped lanes.

Illegal (backwards). \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) is our body. Crash. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) is free now, but UP from there is blocked by our body at (2,8), so that route cuts off vertical escape and leaves only RIGHT/DOWN next turn. Risky. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) is clean and leads straight toward the apple chain at (1,5),(1,4),(1,3). Keeps us on a vertical spine that can wall the board and herd #0 later. \u2705\n\nTactical read: Opponent head is at (8,7) \u2014 far right. No immediate head-on threat this turn. We\u2019re behind on apples (15 vs 21), so we should avoid forcing head-on collisions for now and instead grow safely to gain board control. Going DOWN pursues apples, length, and builds a left-of-center vertical wall to start corralling them into the right-side corridor later.\n\nShort-term plan (next 4\u20138 turns):\n- Commit DOWN into (1,6) \u2192 (1,5) to grab that apple chain and grow.  \n- After lengthening, continue to extend the vertical spine and then sweep right across higher rows to compress #0\u2019s safe space.  \n- Avoid any risky head-on until we close the apple gap; only force collisions when we have more apples and a guaranteed choke.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it tight and start boxing him in \u2014 time to get those extra apples and then pounce.

Chain-growth + space = control. \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e  \n- DOWN eats an apple too, but leaves fewer immediate exits (0,3 is our body), increasing trap risk.

We should prioritize sustainable board control and chaining apples to close the 4-point gap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (2,4) now, then push to (3,4) \u2192 (4,4) to pile apples and force the enemy rightward.  \n- Keep at least two escape options available each turn. Only force head-on if we have apples > opponent.  \n- Watch their lateral moves from (5,7) \u2014 if they overcommit down the right wall, we shut the door and score the KO.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and keep the squeeze \u2014 full send. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

They\u2019re stuck on our left side of the board and can\u2019t immediately contest the (5,4)/(5,3) apple chain this turn. No simultaneous head-on threat to our immediate neighbors.\n\nWhy RIGHT? Simple \u2014 we close the score gap and keep freedom. Grabbing (5,4) right now:\n- Nets an apple immediately (+1 apple), then we can follow to (5,3) next turn for another chain if safe. CONTENT!!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e  \n- After eating at (5,4) we still have multiple exit choices (UP/RIGHT/DOWN), so we\u2019re not getting funneled into our own left-wall body.  \n- Keeps pressure: if the opponent tries to snake down to contest, we can pivot and use our extra length to wall them or force mistakes.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):  \n1) RIGHT \u2192 take (5,4).  \n2) If safe, DOWN \u2192 take (5,3) and stretch our lead.  \n3) Maintain at least two escape options after each move; if the enemy commits down our flank, tighten the corridor and force them into our body or a bad head-on.\n\nLet\u2019s chip away at that 3-apple deficit and make \u2019em choke.

We also must avoid giving them a chance to kite us into a trap \u2014 so prefer moves that keep at least two escape options after eating.\n\nWhy DOWN:\n- Grabs the apple at (5,3) now to chip the score gap. \ud83c\udf4f  \n- After eating, we still have multiple exits: (6,3) right, (5,2) down, or back towards (5,4) (but that would be our body), so we can pivot and avoid being boxed.  \n- Opponent is far-left and constrained along the top; taking this apple does not create an immediate head-on risk.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) Secure (5,3) now.  \n2) Immediately keep options open: prefer (6,3) or (5,2) next to avoid getting funneled.  \n3) If the enemy commits into the central corridor, use our extra length to hem them in and force them into our body or into risky head-on attempts (we AVOID head-on if they still lead in score). Be aggressive but keep \u22652 escape routes.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and keep the pressure. DOWN",
