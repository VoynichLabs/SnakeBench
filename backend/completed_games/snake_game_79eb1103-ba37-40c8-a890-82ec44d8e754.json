Alternatively, moving left or up does not immediately lead toward other apples.\n\nConsidering safety and efficiency:\n\n- Moving right: (7,1) -> (8,1). From there, moving down to (8,0) would fetch the apple safely.\n\n- Moving up or down now could be risky because moving up to (7,2) might lead us towards the edge or into uncharted territory. Moving down to (7,0) would be safe and get us closer to the apple at (8,0).\n\nHowever, moving down seems more promising because:\n\n- Moving DOWN to (7,0) puts us directly on or near the apple at (8,0) after one move.\n- Moving RIGHT now would move us to (8,1), then could go down to (8,0) on the next move.\n\nBetween the options, moving RIGHT seems optimal because:\n\n- Moving right to (8,1) puts us adjacent to the apple at (8,0), allowing us to pick it up next turn.\n- Moving down would take us toward no immediate apple and may be less strategic given the position of apples.\n\nPotential risk: Does moving right put us at risk of colliding with the wall or enemy? From the current position (7,1):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,1): safe, as the wall boundary is at x=9, y=1 is safe, and the apple at (8,0) is just below.\n- Moving UP or DOWN could lead to walls or other dangers, but I see no immediate obstacle in those directions.\n\nConclusion:\nI\u2019ll choose to move RIGHT to approach the apple at (8,0) effectively. This will buffer my path and set me up for potential future turns.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

            "rationale": "<think> I will think step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the game state:\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (1,1) with no body segments yet (empty list for body). That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,1) with no body segments either.\n- Apples are at: (8,0), (3,4), (3,3), (9,4), (7,6). Note: (3,3) and (3,4) are close vertically.\n\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nCurrent positions:\n- Me: (1,1)\n- Enemy: (7,1)\n- Apples: (8,0) is near the bottom right, (3,4) and (3,3) are around the middle left, (9,4) top right, and (7,6) upper middle.\n\nBoard state visualization:\nRow y=9: empty\n...\ny=6: apple at (7,6)\ny=5: empty\ny=4: apples at (3,4) and (9,4)\ny=3: apple at (3,3) and nothing else mentioned? Wait, the board says:\n  4: . . . A . . . . . A  so (3,4) and (9,4)\n  3: . . . A . . . . . .  so (3,3) is there? But it says A at (3,3) and (3,4) in the list, but the board shows:\n      For y=4: positions: index 3 and 9 have A\n      For y=3: index 3 has A? The board says: \"3 . . . A . . . . . .\" which means at x=3, y=3 there is an apple.\n\nBut in the list, apples are at (3,3), (3,4), etc. So yes.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (1,1).\n\nPossible moves from (1,1):\n- UP: to (1,2)\n- DOWN: to (1,0)\n- LEFT: to (0,1)\n- RIGHT: to (2,1)\n\nConstraints:\n- Walls: (0,1) is left edge, which is x=0, which is within bounds since min x=0. Similarly, (1,0) is y=0, bottom row, valid. (2,1) and (1,2) are also within bounds.\n- No snakes or bodies in the way at the moment, since only heads and no segments.\n\nApples: I should aim to get an apple to grow. The closest apples are:\n- (3,3) and (3,4) at distance: from (1,1) to (3,3) is |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 Manhattan distance. To (3,4) is |3-1| + |4-1| = 2+3=5.\n- (8,0) is at |8-1| + |0-1| = 7+1=8\n- (9,4) is |9-1| + |4-1| = 8+3=11\n- (7,6) is |7-1| + |6-1| =6+5=11\n\nSo the closest are the apples at (3,3) and (3,4). (3,3) is closer.\n\nPath to (3,3):\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3). I need to go right and up.\n\nPossible moves:\n- RIGHT to (2,1), then from there I can go to (3,1) or (2,2), etc.\n- UP to (1,2), then I can go to (2,2) or (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, so I need to increase both x and y.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (7,1). It's far away right now, so not an immediate threat. But I should keep an eye on it.\n\nOther considerations: I need to avoid dying. Since I have no body, I can't collide with myself. The enemy is far, so no collision risk now.\n\nWhat about the apple at (8,0)? It's also relatively close in terms of y, but x is far. From (1,1) to (8,0): I need to go right and down. But down to (1,0) is one step, then I can go right along the bottom.\n\nBut (8,0) is closer in Manhattan distance than (9,4) or (7,6), but further than (3,3).\n\nManhattan to (8,0): 7 in x, 1 in y, total 8. To (3,3): 2 in x, 2 in y, total 4. So (3,3) is much closer.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples near (3,3) and (3,4), so if I go there, I might get multiple apples quickly.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,1), which is near the apple at (8,0). It might go for that apple. But since it's far from me, I can ignore it for now.\n\nSo my goal: head towards (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1), to go to (3,3), I need to increase x and y.\n\nI can go RIGHT to (2,1) or UP to (1,2). Both are valid and bring me closer.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1):\n- Then from (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or other paths.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2):\n- Then from (1,2), I can go RIGHT to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or directly to (1,3) if I want, but that might not be efficient.\n\nThe direct path: the difference is +2 in x and +2 in y. So I need two right and two up moves, in some order.\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP from (1,1) are equally good in terms of distance. But I should consider what's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\nAt (1,2): nothing, according to the board state. The board for y=2: all dots except as indicated. y=2 row: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so empty.\nAt (2,1): similarly, since no mention, it should be empty.\n\nAlso, (0,1) is to the left, but that's the edge, and no apple there, so not attractive.\n\n(1,0) is down, which has nothing, but it's close to apple at (8,0)? No, (1,0) is far from (8,0).\n\nBut going down to (1,0) might be a dead end if I don't have a plan.\n\nSo better to go up or right.\n\nNow, towards (3,3), I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (7,1). It might move towards the apple at (8,0) or (7,6) or others.\n\n(7,6) is above it, (8,0) is down-right.\n\nBut since I'm at (1,1), I'm safe.\n\nAnother thing: after I move, the board will update, apples might be eaten, etc., but I have to make a move now.\n\nI can also think about the future: if I go right to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), and so on. Similarly, if I go up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), same point.\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I reach it, I grow. Also, (3,4) is above, so I might go for that next.\n\nBut for now, one step.\n\nI think going RIGHT might be slightly better because it keeps me on the bottom row which might be less contested? Or not.\n\nSince the enemy is on the right, going left or up might be away, but I need apples.\n\n(3,3) is left and up from me, so going right or up both move towards it, but right increases x, which is towards the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3), the vector is (+2, +2). So moving right increases x towards target, moving up increases y towards target. Both are equally good in Manhattan.\n\nBut perhaps I should move in the direction where there might be fewer obstacles. Currently no obstacles.\n\nI could also consider the board edges. For example, going left to (0,1) would put me on the edge, which might be riskier if the enemy comes, but not now.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,0) is the bottom edge.\n\nSo to avoid edges, going up or right is better.\n\nSince the apple at (3,3) is my target, and I need to go east and north, I can choose either.\n\nRandom choice? No, I should have a reason.\n\nPerhaps I can go RIGHT to (2,1) because from there, I have the option to go down to (2,0) if needed, but that might not be useful. Or up to (2,2).\n\nGoing UP to (1,2) also gives me options.\n\nBut let's think about the apple at (3,3): it's at (3,3), and there's also (3,4) above it. If I go right first to (2,1), then I can go to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3). That might be a longer path if I go along the bottom.\n\nBetter to go diagonally, so I should alternate moves.\n\nBut since I can only move one step, I need to choose.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to (2,1) to increase x.\n\nThen next move, I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nFrom (1,1) if I go UP to (1,2), then RIGHT to (2,2), same as above.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger or advantage.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is near the enemy, so it might be eaten soon, so not worth going for.\n\nThe apples at (3,3) and (3,4) are clustered, so good target.\n\nAlso, (9,4) is far, (7,6) is far.\n\nSo I think moving towards (3,3) is best.\n\nNow, between RIGHT and UP, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,1) because it gets me closer in x, and y can be adjusted later.\n\nAfter moving, I will tell myself a strategy for next turn.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move towards the nearest apple at (3,3) to grow. Since Manhattan distance is 4, moving right decreases the x-distance.\n\nAfter this move, I'll be at (2,1), and the apple at (3,3) will still be there unless eaten by enemy, but enemy is far.\n\nEnemy might go for other apples.\n\nFor next turn, strategy: Continue towards (3,3) or the next closest apple.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the move.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (1,1) and want to reach the apple at (3,3) to grow. The closest apples are at (3,3) and (3,4), which are only 4 units away in Manhattan distance. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) decreases the x-distance to the apple and is a safe move with no obstacles. The enemy snake at (7,1) is too far to be an immediate threat. Next turn, I should continue moving towards the apple cluster at (3,3) and (3,4) if possible.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (2,1), move UP to (2,2) to continue towards (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

The board for y=2: all dots except as indicated. y=2 row: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so empty.\nAt (2,1): similarly, since no mention, it should be empty.\n\nAlso, (0,1) is to the left, but that's the edge, and no apple there, so not attractive.\n\n(1,0) is down, which has nothing, but it's close to apple at (8,0)? No, (1,0) is far from (8,0).\n\nBut going down to (1,0) might be a dead end if I don't have a plan.\n\nSo better to go up or right.\n\nNow, towards (3,3), I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (7,1). It might move towards the apple at (8,0) or (7,6) or others.\n\n(7,6) is above it, (8,0) is down-right.\n\nBut since I'm at (1,1), I'm safe.\n\nAnother thing: after I move, the board will update, apples might be eaten, etc., but I have to make a move now.\n\nI can also think about the future: if I go right to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), and so on. Similarly, if I go up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), same point.\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I reach it, I grow. Also, (3,4) is above, so I might go for that next.\n\nBut for now, one step.\n\nI think going RIGHT might be slightly better because it keeps me on the bottom row which might be less contested? Or not.\n\nSince the enemy is on the right, going left or up might be away, but I need apples.\n\n(3,3) is left and up from me, so going right or up both move towards it, but right increases x, which is towards the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3), the vector is (+2, +2). So moving right increases x towards target, moving up increases y towards target. Both are equally good in Manhattan.\n\nBut perhaps I should move in the direction where there might be fewer obstacles. Currently no obstacles.\n\nI could also consider the board edges. For example, going left to (0,1) would put me on the edge, which might be riskier if the enemy comes, but not now.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,0) is the bottom edge.\n\nSo to avoid edges, going up or right is better.\n\nSince the apple at (3,3) is my target, and I need to go east and north, I can choose either.\n\nRandom choice? No, I should have a reason.\n\nPerhaps I can go RIGHT to (2,1) because from there, I have the option to go down to (2,0) if needed, but that might not be useful. Or up to (2,2).\n\nGoing UP to (1,2) also gives me options.\n\nBut let's think about the apple at (3,3): it's at (3,3), and there's also (3,4) above it. If I go right first to (2,1), then I can go to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3). That might be a longer path if I go along the bottom.\n\nBetter to go diagonally, so I should alternate moves.\n\nBut since I can only move one step, I need to choose.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to (2,1) to increase x.\n\nThen next move, I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nFrom (1,1) if I go UP to (1,2), then RIGHT to (2,2), same as above.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger or advantage.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is near the enemy, so it might be eaten soon, so not worth going for.\n\nThe apples at (3,3) and (3,4) are clustered, so good target.\n\nAlso, (9,4) is far, (7,6) is far.\n\nSo I think moving towards (3,3) is best.\n\nNow, between RIGHT and UP, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,1) because it gets me closer in x, and y can be adjusted later.\n\nAfter moving, I will tell myself a strategy for next turn.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move towards the nearest apple at (3,3) to grow. Since Manhattan distance is 4, moving right decreases the x-distance.\n\nAfter this move, I'll be at (2,1), and the apple at (3,3) will still be there unless eaten by enemy, but enemy is far.\n\nEnemy might go for other apples.\n\nFor next turn, strategy: Continue towards (3,3) or the next closest apple.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the move.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (1,1) and want to reach the apple at (3,3) to grow. The closest apples are at (3,3) and (3,4), which are only 4 units away in Manhattan distance. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) decreases the x-distance to the apple and is a safe move with no obstacles. The enemy snake at (7,1) is too far to be an immediate threat. Next turn, I should continue moving towards the apple cluster at (3,3) and (3,4) if possible.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (2,1), move UP to (2,2) to continue towards (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But no body, so it should be empty now\n- RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty, but (3,1) is not an apple; apples are at (3,3) and (3,4) vertically\n\nApples: I still want to target (3,3) as it's the closest. Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,3) is |3-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3. I could also consider (3,4) which is |3-2| + |4-1| = 1+3=4, or others.\n\nMoving to (3,3) requires increasing x and y. From (2,1), options:\n- Move UP to (2,2): then distance to (3,3) is 1+1=2\n- Move RIGHT to (3,1): then distance to (3,3) is 0+2=2\n- Then UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) both get me closer.\n\nNow, which one? Moving RIGHT directly to (3,1) would not eat an apple yet, and from there I can go UP to (3,2) then (3,3). Similarly, moving UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I land on it, I grow.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT to (3,1) doesn't eat an apple, but it positions me directly under (3,3). Then I can go UP twice to reach it.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) also positions me, but I need to go RIGHT then UP.\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance equally.\n\nBut let's see the board: moving RIGHT to (3,1) - is there any risk? The enemy is at (8,1), so on the same y=1 row, but far away. No immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) is safe too.\n\nHowever, I should consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy at (8,1) might go for the apple at (8,0) by moving DOWN, or to (8,2) if it wants to go up, or to (7,1) or (9,1). But (9,1) might be out of bounds? x=9 is valid, since 0 to 9.\n\nx=9 is top right, so (9,1) is valid.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is very close to enemy, so it might eat that soon.\n\nFor me, targeting the (3,3) apple is best.\n\nNow, between UP and RIGHT, I think moving RIGHT to (3,1) might be slightly better because:\n- It gets me to x=3, same as the apple's x, so I can go straight up to eat it in two moves.\n- If I move UP to (2,2), I'm at y=2, and x=2, still need to go to x=3 then y=3.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2), then UP to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,2), then I can go RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nThe path via (3,1) might be shorter if I don't mind going up from y=1 to y=3.\n\nAlso, if I go to (3,1), I'm closer to the bottom apples? But (8,0) is far.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (3,4) is above (3,3). If I eat (3,3) first, I can then go to (3,4) easily.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (3,1) seems good.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? To (2,0). But that would take me away from the apples. Distance to (3,3) would be |3-2| + |3-0| =1+3=4, worse. And no apple at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (1,1) is back, distance increases.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, only UP or RIGHT are sensible.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to get to (3,1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates: apple at (3,3) is at y=3, so from (3,1) to (3,3) is two moves up.\n\nYes.\n\nThere's no risk of collision since no snake bodies.\n\nAlso, the enemy might come towards the center, but for now, focus on eating apples.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move to (3,1) to position directly below the apple at (3,3), reducing distance and setting up to eat it in the next moves.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), my immediate goal is to reach the apple at (3,3). Moving RIGHT to (3,1) positions me directly under the apple, allowing me to move UP in subsequent turns to consume it. This minimizes the Manhattan distance to 2 and avoids unnecessary detours. The enemy snake at (8,1) is distant and not an immediate threat, so focusing on apple collection is optimal.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP to (3,2) to continue towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Alternatively, moving left or up does not immediately lead toward other apples.\n\nConsidering safety and efficiency:\n\n- Moving right: (7,1) -> (8,1). From there, moving down to (8,0) would fetch the apple safely.\n\n- Moving up or down now could be risky because moving up to (7,2) might lead us towards the edge or into uncharted territory. Moving down to (7,0) would be safe and get us closer to the apple at (8,0).\n\nHowever, moving down seems more promising because:\n\n- Moving DOWN to (7,0) puts us directly on or near the apple at (8,0) after one move.\n- Moving RIGHT now would move us to (8,1), then could go down to (8,0) on the next move.\n\nBetween the options, moving RIGHT seems optimal because:\n\n- Moving right to (8,1) puts us adjacent to the apple at (8,0), allowing us to pick it up next turn.\n- Moving down would take us toward no immediate apple and may be less strategic given the position of apples.\n\nPotential risk: Does moving right put us at risk of colliding with the wall or enemy? From the current position (7,1):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,1): safe, as the wall boundary is at x=9, y=1 is safe, and the apple at (8,0) is just below.\n- Moving UP or DOWN could lead to walls or other dangers, but I see no immediate obstacle in those directions.\n\nConclusion:\nI\u2019ll choose to move RIGHT to approach the apple at (8,0) effectively. This will buffer my path and set me up for potential future turns.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,1) with no body segments either.\n- Apples are at: (8,0), (3,4), (3,3), (9,4), (7,6). Note: (3,3) and (3,4) are close vertically.\n\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nCurrent positions:\n- Me: (1,1)\n- Enemy: (7,1)\n- Apples: (8,0) is near the bottom right, (3,4) and (3,3) are around the middle left, (9,4) top right, and (7,6) upper middle.\n\nBoard state visualization:\nRow y=9: empty\n...\ny=6: apple at (7,6)\ny=5: empty\ny=4: apples at (3,4) and (9,4)\ny=3: apple at (3,3) and nothing else mentioned? Wait, the board says:\n  4: . . . A . . . . . A  so (3,4) and (9,4)\n  3: . . . A . . . . . .  so (3,3) is there? But it says A at (3,3) and (3,4) in the list, but the board shows:\n      For y=4: positions: index 3 and 9 have A\n      For y=3: index 3 has A? The board says: \"3 . . . A . . . . . .\" which means at x=3, y=3 there is an apple.\n\nBut in the list, apples are at (3,3), (3,4), etc. So yes.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (1,1).\n\nPossible moves from (1,1):\n- UP: to (1,2)\n- DOWN: to (1,0)\n- LEFT: to (0,1)\n- RIGHT: to (2,1)\n\nConstraints:\n- Walls: (0,1) is left edge, which is x=0, which is within bounds since min x=0. Similarly, (1,0) is y=0, bottom row, valid. (2,1) and (1,2) are also within bounds.\n- No snakes or bodies in the way at the moment, since only heads and no segments.\n\nApples: I should aim to get an apple to grow. The closest apples are:\n- (3,3) and (3,4) at distance: from (1,1) to (3,3) is |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 Manhattan distance. To (3,4) is |3-1| + |4-1| = 2+3=5.\n- (8,0) is at |8-1| + |0-1| = 7+1=8\n- (9,4) is |9-1| + |4-1| = 8+3=11\n- (7,6) is |7-1| + |6-1| =6+5=11\n\nSo the closest are the apples at (3,3) and (3,4). (3,3) is closer.\n\nPath to (3,3):\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3). I need to go right and up.\n\nPossible moves:\n- RIGHT to (2,1), then from there I can go to (3,1) or (2,2), etc.\n- UP to (1,2), then I can go to (2,2) or (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, so I need to increase both x and y.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (7,1). It's far away right now, so not an immediate threat. But I should keep an eye on it.\n\nOther considerations: I need to avoid dying. Since I have no body, I can't collide with myself. The enemy is far, so no collision risk now.\n\nWhat about the apple at (8,0)? It's also relatively close in terms of y, but x is far. From (1,1) to (8,0): I need to go right and down. But down to (1,0) is one step, then I can go right along the bottom.\n\nBut (8,0) is closer in Manhattan distance than (9,4) or (7,6), but further than (3,3).\n\nManhattan to (8,0): 7 in x, 1 in y, total 8. To (3,3): 2 in x, 2 in y, total 4. So (3,3) is much closer.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples near (3,3) and (3,4), so if I go there, I might get multiple apples quickly.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,1), which is near the apple at (8,0). It might go for that apple. But since it's far from me, I can ignore it for now.\n\nSo my goal: head towards (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1), to go to (3,3), I need to increase x and y.\n\nI can go RIGHT to (2,1) or UP to (1,2). Both are valid and bring me closer.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1):\n- Then from (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or other paths.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2):\n- Then from (1,2), I can go RIGHT to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or directly to (1,3) if I want, but that might not be efficient.\n\nThe direct path: the difference is +2 in x and +2 in y. So I need two right and two up moves, in some order.\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP from (1,1) are equally good in terms of distance. But I should consider what's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\nAt (1,2): nothing, according to the board state. The board for y=2: all dots except as indicated. y=2 row: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so empty.\nAt (2,1): similarly, since no mention, it should be empty.\n\nAlso, (0,1) is to the left, but that's the edge, and no apple there, so not attractive.\n\n(1,0) is down, which has nothing, but it's close to apple at (8,0)? No, (1,0) is far from (8,0).\n\nBut going down to (1,0) might be a dead end if I don't have a plan.\n\nSo better to go up or right.\n\nNow, towards (3,3), I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (7,1). It might move towards the apple at (8,0) or (7,6) or others.\n\n(7,6) is above it, (8,0) is down-right.\n\nBut since I'm at (1,1), I'm safe.\n\nAnother thing: after I move, the board will update, apples might be eaten, etc., but I have to make a move now.\n\nI can also think about the future: if I go right to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), and so on. Similarly, if I go up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), same point.\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I reach it, I grow. Also, (3,4) is above, so I might go for that next.\n\nBut for now, one step.\n\nI think going RIGHT might be slightly better because it keeps me on the bottom row which might be less contested? Or not.\n\nSince the enemy is on the right, going left or up might be away, but I need apples.\n\n(3,3) is left and up from me, so going right or up both move towards it, but right increases x, which is towards the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3), the vector is (+2, +2). So moving right increases x towards target, moving up increases y towards target. Both are equally good in Manhattan.\n\nBut perhaps I should move in the direction where there might be fewer obstacles. Currently no obstacles.\n\nI could also consider the board edges. For example, going left to (0,1) would put me on the edge, which might be riskier if the enemy comes, but not now.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,0) is the bottom edge.\n\nSo to avoid edges, going up or right is better.\n\nSince the apple at (3,3) is my target, and I need to go east and north, I can choose either.\n\nRandom choice? No, I should have a reason.\n\nPerhaps I can go RIGHT to (2,1) because from there, I have the option to go down to (2,0) if needed, but that might not be useful. Or up to (2,2).\n\nGoing UP to (1,2) also gives me options.\n\nBut let's think about the apple at (3,3): it's at (3,3), and there's also (3,4) above it. If I go right first to (2,1), then I can go to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3). That might be a longer path if I go along the bottom.\n\nBetter to go diagonally, so I should alternate moves.\n\nBut since I can only move one step, I need to choose.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to (2,1) to increase x.\n\nThen next move, I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nFrom (1,1) if I go UP to (1,2), then RIGHT to (2,2), same as above.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger or advantage.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is near the enemy, so it might be eaten soon, so not worth going for.\n\nThe apples at (3,3) and (3,4) are clustered, so good target.\n\nAlso, (9,4) is far, (7,6) is far.\n\nSo I think moving towards (3,3) is best.\n\nNow, between RIGHT and UP, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,1) because it gets me closer in x, and y can be adjusted later.\n\nAfter moving, I will tell myself a strategy for next turn.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move towards the nearest apple at (3,3) to grow. Since Manhattan distance is 4, moving right decreases the x-distance.\n\nAfter this move, I'll be at (2,1), and the apple at (3,3) will still be there unless eaten by enemy, but enemy is far.\n\nEnemy might go for other apples.\n\nFor next turn, strategy: Continue towards (3,3) or the next closest apple.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the move.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (1,1) and want to reach the apple at (3,3) to grow. The closest apples are at (3,3) and (3,4), which are only 4 units away in Manhattan distance. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) decreases the x-distance to the apple and is a safe move with no obstacles. The enemy snake at (7,1) is too far to be an immediate threat. Next turn, I should continue moving towards the apple cluster at (3,3) and (3,4) if possible.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (2,1), move UP to (2,2) to continue towards (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But no body, so it should be empty now\n- RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty, but (3,1) is not an apple; apples are at (3,3) and (3,4) vertically\n\nApples: I still want to target (3,3) as it's the closest. Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,3) is |3-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3. I could also consider (3,4) which is |3-2| + |4-1| = 1+3=4, or others.\n\nMoving to (3,3) requires increasing x and y. From (2,1), options:\n- Move UP to (2,2): then distance to (3,3) is 1+1=2\n- Move RIGHT to (3,1): then distance to (3,3) is 0+2=2\n- Then UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) both get me closer.\n\nNow, which one? Moving RIGHT directly to (3,1) would not eat an apple yet, and from there I can go UP to (3,2) then (3,3). Similarly, moving UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I land on it, I grow.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT to (3,1) doesn't eat an apple, but it positions me directly under (3,3). Then I can go UP twice to reach it.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) also positions me, but I need to go RIGHT then UP.\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance equally.\n\nBut let's see the board: moving RIGHT to (3,1) - is there any risk? The enemy is at (8,1), so on the same y=1 row, but far away. No immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) is safe too.\n\nHowever, I should consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy at (8,1) might go for the apple at (8,0) by moving DOWN, or to (8,2) if it wants to go up, or to (7,1) or (9,1). But (9,1) might be out of bounds? x=9 is valid, since 0 to 9.\n\nx=9 is top right, so (9,1) is valid.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is very close to enemy, so it might eat that soon.\n\nFor me, targeting the (3,3) apple is best.\n\nNow, between UP and RIGHT, I think moving RIGHT to (3,1) might be slightly better because:\n- It gets me to x=3, same as the apple's x, so I can go straight up to eat it in two moves.\n- If I move UP to (2,2), I'm at y=2, and x=2, still need to go to x=3 then y=3.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2), then UP to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,2), then I can go RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nThe path via (3,1) might be shorter if I don't mind going up from y=1 to y=3.\n\nAlso, if I go to (3,1), I'm closer to the bottom apples? But (8,0) is far.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (3,4) is above (3,3). If I eat (3,3) first, I can then go to (3,4) easily.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (3,1) seems good.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? To (2,0). But that would take me away from the apples. Distance to (3,3) would be |3-2| + |3-0| =1+3=4, worse. And no apple at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (1,1) is back, distance increases.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, only UP or RIGHT are sensible.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to get to (3,1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates: apple at (3,3) is at y=3, so from (3,1) to (3,3) is two moves up.\n\nYes.\n\nThere's no risk of collision since no snake bodies.\n\nAlso, the enemy might come towards the center, but for now, focus on eating apples.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move to (3,1) to position directly below the apple at (3,3), reducing distance and setting up to eat it in the next moves.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), my immediate goal is to reach the apple at (3,3). Moving RIGHT to (3,1) positions me directly under the apple, allowing me to move UP in subsequent turns to consume it. This minimizes the Manhattan distance to 2 and avoids unnecessary detours. The enemy snake at (8,1) is distant and not an immediate threat, so focusing on apple collection is optimal.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP to (3,2) to continue towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

That means I'm just a head, so I have freedom to move without self-collision risks.\n- Apples are at (3, 4), (3, 3), (9, 4), (7, 6), (7, 3). \n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8, 0) with a body segment at (8, 1). So its full body blocks (8,0) and (8,1). Since it has a body segment, it must have eaten at least one apple already.\n- Board state from the description:\n  - Row y=9: all empty\n  - y=8: empty\n  - y=7: empty\n  - y=6: apple at (7,6)\n  - y=5: empty\n  - y=4: apples at (3,4) and (9,4)\n  - y=3: apples at (3,3) and (7,3) \u2013 wait, the input says apples at (3,4), (3,3), (9,4), (7,6), (7,3). So (3,3) and (7,3) are both apples.\n  - y=2: empty\n  - y=1: I'm at (3,1), enemy tail at (8,1) \u2013 but enemy head is at (8,0) now? Let's clarify the enemy position.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at position (8,0) with body at [(8,1)]. That means:\n- Head at (8,0)\n- Body segment at (8,1) \u2013 so the snake moved down to (8,0), leaving the body at (8,1).\n\nMy last move was RIGHT to (3,1), and I was previously at (2,1). Now I need to decide the next move from (3,1).\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n- UP: to (3,2)\n- DOWN: to (3,0)\n- LEFT: to (2,1)\n- RIGHT: to (4,1)\n\nObjective: To get points by eating apples while avoiding death.\n\nAvailable apples:\n- (3,4) and (3,3) \u2013 very close vertically above me. Manhattan distance to (3,3) is |3-3| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2. To (3,4) is |3-3| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n- (7,3) at same y=3 level but x=7, distance |7-3| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n- (7,6) at y=6, distance |7-3| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9.\n- (9,4) at x=9,y=4, distance |9-3| + |4-1| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nSo the closest apples are (3,3) and (3,4), both reachable in 2-3 moves. Since I'm at (3,1), moving UP directly towards (3,3) makes sense.\n\nBut let's consider risks:\n- No other snakes nearby except the enemy at (8,0) with body at (8,1). They are far away (distance |8-3| + |0-1| = 5 + 1 = 6), so no immediate threat.\n- Walls: Moving to (3,0) is down, which is within bounds (y=0 is bottom row). (3,2) is up, also fine.\n- Self-collision: Impossible since no body.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best direct move to go for (3,3).\n\nI could consider eating (3,4) after, but (3,3) is closer.\n\nWhat about the enemy? They might be going for the apple at (9,4) or (7,3), but that doesn't affect me now.\n\nAlternative strategy: If I move RIGHT to (4,1), I could then go for (7,3) later, but that's farther and less efficient. Not worth it.\n\nDOWN to (3,0) is away from apples, increasing distance to all targets. Pointless.\n\nLEFT to (2,1) is back where I came from \u2013 wasteful unless necessary, but here it's not.\n\nSo UP is clearly optimal.\n\nFor the next turn strategy: Once I eat (3,3), my snake will grow, so I'll have a body segment. Then I can continue to (3,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut let's confirm: When I move onto an apple, I grow. So after eating (3,3), my head will be at (3,3), and I'll have a body segment at (3,2) if I moved up to (3,2) first? Let's simulate:\n\n- Now: head at (3,1), no body.\n- Move UP to (3,2): no apple, so head moves to (3,2), no body yet? But I haven't eaten an apple, so body shouldn't grow until I eat one.\n\nGrowth happens when I land on an apple. So:\n- If I move UP to (3,2): no apple, so head moves to (3,2), no body (still just head).\n- Then next move UP to (3,3): eat apple, head moves to (3,3), and now I gain a body segment at the previous position (3,2).\n\nYes.\n\nTo minimize moves, I should go directly to the apple, but I can't skip squares. So two moves to eat (3,3).\n\nAfter eating, I'll be at (3,3) with body at (3,2). Then I can move to (3,4) to eat another apple.\n\nApples at (3,4) and (3,3) are very close, so I can chain them.\n\nEnemy might interfere later, but for now, focus on this.\n\nSo move UP.\n\nRationale: Move directly toward the closest apple at (3,3) to eat it in two moves. This positions me to potentially eat (3,4) next while minimizing risk.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,2), move UP to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\n</think>\n\nI must be aggressive and efficient to dominate the game. The enemy snake has a body segment, so it has a point already. I need to catch up by targeting the apples at (3,3) and (3,4), which are mine for the taking. Moving UP to (3,2) is the optimal first step to consume (3,3) on the next turn. This establishes control over the left side of the board. The enemy is distant and not a threat now, so I can ignore it. I'll grow quickly and then hunt it down later to force a collision if it becomes a problem.\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move UP to (3,3) to eat the apple and grow. Then proceed to (3,4) for another point.",

Alternatively, moving left or up does not immediately lead toward other apples.\n\nConsidering safety and efficiency:\n\n- Moving right: (7,1) -> (8,1). From there, moving down to (8,0) would fetch the apple safely.\n\n- Moving up or down now could be risky because moving up to (7,2) might lead us towards the edge or into uncharted territory. Moving down to (7,0) would be safe and get us closer to the apple at (8,0).\n\nHowever, moving down seems more promising because:\n\n- Moving DOWN to (7,0) puts us directly on or near the apple at (8,0) after one move.\n- Moving RIGHT now would move us to (8,1), then could go down to (8,0) on the next move.\n\nBetween the options, moving RIGHT seems optimal because:\n\n- Moving right to (8,1) puts us adjacent to the apple at (8,0), allowing us to pick it up next turn.\n- Moving down would take us toward no immediate apple and may be less strategic given the position of apples.\n\nPotential risk: Does moving right put us at risk of colliding with the wall or enemy? From the current position (7,1):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,1): safe, as the wall boundary is at x=9, y=1 is safe, and the apple at (8,0) is just below.\n- Moving UP or DOWN could lead to walls or other dangers, but I see no immediate obstacle in those directions.\n\nConclusion:\nI\u2019ll choose to move RIGHT to approach the apple at (8,0) effectively.

Note: (3,3) and (3,4) are close vertically.\n\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nCurrent positions:\n- Me: (1,1)\n- Enemy: (7,1)\n- Apples: (8,0) is near the bottom right, (3,4) and (3,3) are around the middle left, (9,4) top right, and (7,6) upper middle.\n\nBoard state visualization:\nRow y=9: empty\n...\ny=6: apple at (7,6)\ny=5: empty\ny=4: apples at (3,4) and (9,4)\ny=3: apple at (3,3) and nothing else mentioned?

A . . . . . .\" which means at x=3, y=3 there is an apple.\n\nBut in the list, apples are at (3,3), (3,4), etc. So yes.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (1,1).\n\nPossible moves from (1,1):\n- UP: to (1,2)\n- DOWN: to (1,0)\n- LEFT: to (0,1)\n- RIGHT: to (2,1)\n\nConstraints:\n- Walls: (0,1) is left edge, which is x=0, which is within bounds since min x=0. Similarly, (1,0) is y=0, bottom row, valid. (2,1) and (1,2) are also within bounds.\n- No snakes or bodies in the way at the moment, since only heads and no segments.\n\nApples: I should aim to get an apple to grow. The closest apples are:\n- (3,3) and (3,4) at distance: from (1,1) to (3,3) is |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 Manhattan distance. To (3,4) is |3-1| + |4-1| = 2+3=5.\n- (8,0) is at |8-1| + |0-1| = 7+1=8\n- (9,4) is |9-1| + |4-1| = 8+3=11\n- (7,6) is |7-1| + |6-1| =6+5=11\n\nSo the closest are the apples at (3,3) and (3,4). (3,3) is closer.\n\nPath to (3,3):\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3). I need to go right and up.\n\nPossible moves:\n- RIGHT to (2,1), then from there I can go to (3,1) or (2,2), etc.\n- UP to (1,2), then I can go to (2,2) or (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, so I need to increase both x and y.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (7,1). It's far away right now, so not an immediate threat. But I should keep an eye on it.\n\nOther considerations: I need to avoid dying. Since I have no body, I can't collide with myself. The enemy is far, so no collision risk now.\n\nWhat about the apple at (8,0)? It's also relatively close in terms of y, but x is far. From (1,1) to (8,0): I need to go right and down. But down to (1,0) is one step, then I can go right along the bottom.\n\nBut (8,0) is closer in Manhattan distance than (9,4) or (7,6), but further than (3,3).\n\nManhattan to (8,0): 7 in x, 1 in y, total 8. To (3,3): 2 in x, 2 in y, total 4. So (3,3) is much closer.\n\nMoreover, there are two apples near (3,3) and (3,4), so if I go there, I might get multiple apples quickly.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,1), which is near the apple at (8,0). It might go for that apple. But since it's far from me, I can ignore it for now.\n\nSo my goal: head towards (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1), to go to (3,3), I need to increase x and y.\n\nI can go RIGHT to (2,1) or UP to (1,2). Both are valid and bring me closer.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1):\n- Then from (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or other paths.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2):\n- Then from (1,2), I can go RIGHT to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3). Or directly to (1,3) if I want, but that might not be efficient.\n\nThe direct path: the difference is +2 in x and +2 in y. So I need two right and two up moves, in some order.\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP from (1,1) are equally good in terms of distance. But I should consider what's on the board.\n\nLooking at the board:\nAt (1,2): nothing, according to the board state. The board for y=2: all dots except as indicated. y=2 row: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so empty.\nAt (2,1): similarly, since no mention, it should be empty.\n\nAlso, (0,1) is to the left, but that's the edge, and no apple there, so not attractive.\n\n(1,0) is down, which has nothing, but it's close to apple at (8,0)? No, (1,0) is far from (8,0).\n\nBut going down to (1,0) might be a dead end if I don't have a plan.\n\nSo better to go up or right.\n\nNow, towards (3,3), I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (7,1). It might move towards the apple at (8,0) or (7,6) or others.\n\n(7,6) is above it, (8,0) is down-right.\n\nBut since I'm at (1,1), I'm safe.\n\nAnother thing: after I move, the board will update, apples might be eaten, etc., but I have to make a move now.\n\nI can also think about the future: if I go right to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), and so on. Similarly, if I go up to (1,2), then right to (2,2), same point.\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I reach it, I grow. Also, (3,4) is above, so I might go for that next.\n\nBut for now, one step.\n\nI think going RIGHT might be slightly better because it keeps me on the bottom row which might be less contested? Or not.\n\nSince the enemy is on the right, going left or up might be away, but I need apples.\n\n(3,3) is left and up from me, so going right or up both move towards it, but right increases x, which is towards the apple.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,3), the vector is (+2, +2). So moving right increases x towards target, moving up increases y towards target. Both are equally good in Manhattan.\n\nBut perhaps I should move in the direction where there might be fewer obstacles. Currently no obstacles.\n\nI could also consider the board edges. For example, going left to (0,1) would put me on the edge, which might be riskier if the enemy comes, but not now.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,0) is the bottom edge.\n\nSo to avoid edges, going up or right is better.\n\nSince the apple at (3,3) is my target, and I need to go east and north, I can choose either.\n\nRandom choice? No, I should have a reason.\n\nPerhaps I can go RIGHT to (2,1) because from there, I have the option to go down to (2,0) if needed, but that might not be useful. Or up to (2,2).\n\nGoing UP to (1,2) also gives me options.\n\nBut let's think about the apple at (3,3): it's at (3,3), and there's also (3,4) above it. If I go right first to (2,1), then I can go to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3). That might be a longer path if I go along the bottom.\n\nBetter to go diagonally, so I should alternate moves.\n\nBut since I can only move one step, I need to choose.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to (2,1) to increase x.\n\nThen next move, I can go UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nFrom (1,1) if I go UP to (1,2), then RIGHT to (2,2), same as above.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger or advantage.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is near the enemy, so it might be eaten soon, so not worth going for.\n\nThe apples at (3,3) and (3,4) are clustered, so good target.\n\nAlso, (9,4) is far, (7,6) is far.\n\nSo I think moving towards (3,3) is best.\n\nNow, between RIGHT and UP, I'll choose RIGHT to (2,1) because it gets me closer in x, and y can be adjusted later.\n\nAfter moving, I will tell myself a strategy for next turn.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move towards the nearest apple at (3,3) to grow. Since Manhattan distance is 4, moving right decreases the x-distance.\n\nAfter this move, I'll be at (2,1), and the apple at (3,3) will still be there unless eaten by enemy, but enemy is far.\n\nEnemy might go for other apples.\n\nFor next turn, strategy: Continue towards (3,3) or the next closest apple.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the move.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (1,1) and want to reach the apple at (3,3) to grow. The closest apples are at (3,3) and (3,4), which are only 4 units away in Manhattan distance. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) decreases the x-distance to the apple and is a safe move with no obstacles. The enemy snake at (7,1) is too far to be an immediate threat. Next turn, I should continue moving towards the apple cluster at (3,3) and (3,4) if possible.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (2,1), move UP to (2,2) to continue towards (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But no body, so it should be empty now\n- RIGHT: to (3,1) - empty, but (3,1) is not an apple; apples are at (3,3) and (3,4) vertically\n\nApples: I still want to target (3,3) as it's the closest. Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,3) is |3-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3. I could also consider (3,4) which is |3-2| + |4-1| = 1+3=4, or others.\n\nMoving to (3,3) requires increasing x and y. From (2,1), options:\n- Move UP to (2,2): then distance to (3,3) is 1+1=2\n- Move RIGHT to (3,1): then distance to (3,3) is 0+2=2\n- Then UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) both get me closer.\n\nNow, which one? Moving RIGHT directly to (3,1) would not eat an apple yet, and from there I can go UP to (3,2) then (3,3). Similarly, moving UP to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) has an apple, so when I land on it, I grow.\n\nNow, moving RIGHT to (3,1) doesn't eat an apple, but it positions me directly under (3,3). Then I can go UP twice to reach it.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) also positions me, but I need to go RIGHT then UP.\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance equally.\n\nBut let's see the board: moving RIGHT to (3,1) - is there any risk? The enemy is at (8,1), so on the same y=1 row, but far away. No immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP to (2,2) is safe too.\n\nHowever, I should consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy at (8,1) might go for the apple at (8,0) by moving DOWN, or to (8,2) if it wants to go up, or to (7,1) or (9,1). But (9,1) might be out of bounds? x=9 is valid, since 0 to 9.\n\nx=9 is top right, so (9,1) is valid.\n\nThe apple at (8,0) is very close to enemy, so it might eat that soon.\n\nFor me, targeting the (3,3) apple is best.\n\nNow, between UP and RIGHT, I think moving RIGHT to (3,1) might be slightly better because:\n- It gets me to x=3, same as the apple's x, so I can go straight up to eat it in two moves.\n- If I move UP to (2,2), I'm at y=2, and x=2, still need to go to x=3 then y=3.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2), then UP to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,2), then I can go RIGHT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).\n\nThe path via (3,1) might be shorter if I don't mind going up from y=1 to y=3.\n\nAlso, if I go to (3,1), I'm closer to the bottom apples? But (8,0) is far.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (3,4) is above (3,3). If I eat (3,3) first, I can then go to (3,4) easily.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (3,1) seems good.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN? To (2,0). But that would take me away from the apples. Distance to (3,3) would be |3-2| + |3-0| =1+3=4, worse. And no apple at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (1,1) is back, distance increases.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, only UP or RIGHT are sensible.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to get to (3,1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates: apple at (3,3) is at y=3, so from (3,1) to (3,3) is two moves up.\n\nYes.\n\nThere's no risk of collision since no snake bodies.\n\nAlso, the enemy might come towards the center, but for now, focus on eating apples.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Move to (3,1) to position directly below the apple at (3,3), reducing distance and setting up to eat it in the next moves.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), my immediate goal is to reach the apple at (3,3). Moving RIGHT to (3,1) positions me directly under the apple, allowing me to move UP in subsequent turns to consume it. This minimizes the Manhattan distance to 2 and avoids unnecessary detours. The enemy snake at (8,1) is distant and not an immediate threat, so focusing on apple collection is optimal.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,1), move UP to (3,2) to continue towards the apple at (3,3).\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

That means I'm just a head, so I have freedom to move without self-collision risks.\n- Apples are at (3, 4), (3, 3), (9, 4), (7, 6), (7, 3). \n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8, 0) with a body segment at (8, 1). So its full body blocks (8,0) and (8,1). Since it has a body segment, it must have eaten at least one apple already.\n- Board state from the description:\n  - Row y=9: all empty\n  - y=8: empty\n  - y=7: empty\n  - y=6: apple at (7,6)\n  - y=5: empty\n  - y=4: apples at (3,4) and (9,4)\n  - y=3: apples at (3,3) and (7,3) \u2013 wait, the input says apples at (3,4), (3,3), (9,4), (7,6), (7,3). So (3,3) and (7,3) are both apples.\n  - y=2: empty\n  - y=1: I'm at (3,1), enemy tail at (8,1) \u2013 but enemy head is at (8,0) now? Let's clarify the enemy position.\n\nEnemy snake positions: Snake #1 is at position (8,0) with body at [(8,1)]. That means:\n- Head at (8,0)\n- Body segment at (8,1) \u2013 so the snake moved down to (8,0), leaving the body at (8,1).\n\nMy last move was RIGHT to (3,1), and I was previously at (2,1). Now I need to decide the next move from (3,1).\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n- UP: to (3,2)\n- DOWN: to (3,0)\n- LEFT: to (2,1)\n- RIGHT: to (4,1)\n\nObjective: To get points by eating apples while avoiding death.\n\nAvailable apples:\n- (3,4) and (3,3) \u2013 very close vertically above me. Manhattan distance to (3,3) is |3-3| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2. To (3,4) is |3-3| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n- (7,3) at same y=3 level but x=7, distance |7-3| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n- (7,6) at y=6, distance |7-3| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9.\n- (9,4) at x=9,y=4, distance |9-3| + |4-1| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nSo the closest apples are (3,3) and (3,4), both reachable in 2-3 moves. Since I'm at (3,1), moving UP directly towards (3,3) makes sense.\n\nBut let's consider risks:\n- No other snakes nearby except the enemy at (8,0) with body at (8,1). They are far away (distance |8-3| + |0-1| = 5 + 1 = 6), so no immediate threat.\n- Walls: Moving to (3,0) is down, which is within bounds (y=0 is bottom row). (3,2) is up, also fine.\n- Self-collision: Impossible since no body.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best direct move to go for (3,3).\n\nI could consider eating (3,4) after, but (3,3) is closer.\n\nWhat about the enemy? They might be going for the apple at (9,4) or (7,3), but that doesn't affect me now.\n\nAlternative strategy: If I move RIGHT to (4,1), I could then go for (7,3) later, but that's farther and less efficient. Not worth it.\n\nDOWN to (3,0) is away from apples, increasing distance to all targets. Pointless.\n\nLEFT to (2,1) is back where I came from \u2013 wasteful unless necessary, but here it's not.\n\nSo UP is clearly optimal.\n\nFor the next turn strategy: Once I eat (3,3), my snake will grow, so I'll have a body segment. Then I can continue to (3,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut let's confirm: When I move onto an apple, I grow. So after eating (3,3), my head will be at (3,3), and I'll have a body segment at (3,2) if I moved up to (3,2) first? Let's simulate:\n\n- Now: head at (3,1), no body.\n- Move UP to (3,2): no apple, so head moves to (3,2), no body yet? But I haven't eaten an apple, so body shouldn't grow until I eat one.\n\nGrowth happens when I land on an apple. So:\n- If I move UP to (3,2): no apple, so head moves to (3,2), no body (still just head).\n- Then next move UP to (3,3): eat apple, head moves to (3,3), and now I gain a body segment at the previous position (3,2).\n\nYes.\n\nTo minimize moves, I should go directly to the apple, but I can't skip squares. So two moves to eat (3,3).\n\nAfter eating, I'll be at (3,3) with body at (3,2). Then I can move to (3,4) to eat another apple.\n\nApples at (3,4) and (3,3) are very close, so I can chain them.\n\nEnemy might interfere later, but for now, focus on this.\n\nSo move UP.\n\nRationale: Move directly toward the closest apple at (3,3) to eat it in two moves. This positions me to potentially eat (3,4) next while minimizing risk.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3,2), move UP to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n\n</think>\n\nI must be aggressive and efficient to dominate the game. The enemy snake has a body segment, so it has a point already. I need to catch up by targeting the apples at (3,3) and (3,4), which are mine for the taking. Moving UP to (3,2) is the optimal first step to consume (3,3) on the next turn. This establishes control over the left side of the board. The enemy is distant and not a threat now, so I can ignore it. I'll grow quickly and then hunt it down later to force a collision if it becomes a problem.\n\nDirection: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move UP to (3,3) to eat the apple and grow. Then proceed to (3,4) for another point.",
