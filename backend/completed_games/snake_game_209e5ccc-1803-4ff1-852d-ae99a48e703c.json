Eating the apple at (2,6) will grow me to 2 segments (head +1 body) and give me 1 apple, putting me tied with the enemy early on. This keeps the field wide open for maneuverability and sets me up near the cluster of higher-up apples like (3,9), (6,9), and (4,7).\n\nSafe moves: All four directions (UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6)) are on-board and avoid my own non-existent body or the enemy's body/head. No obvious head-on setups since the enemy is distant and can't threaten those spots (e.g., if the enemy aims for my target, it's far; otherwise, no overlap this turn). RIGHT directly eats an apple while preserving multiple future options (pivot north, east, etc. after grabbing it).\n\nAmong options:\n- RIGHT to (2,6): Eats an apple, grows safely, and positions me closer to more apples aloft. High priority for points and flexibility.\n- Other moves are neutral but don't advance toward food as directly\u2014e.g., LEFT retreats, DOWN approaches (0,4) but it's farther away, UP moves toward (1,9) indirectly without eating.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating here, pivot north toward the top-row apples ((1,9), (3,9), (6,9), (8,9)) to chain eats in open space; avoid the southern enemy territory and any tightening corridors.
