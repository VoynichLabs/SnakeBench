Let's get this W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Game Analysis:**\n- **Board:** 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n- **Turn:** 0 (First turn! Fresh start!)\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 7). Body: None. Apples: 0.\n- **Enemy (ID 0):** Head at (3, 9). Body: None. Apples: 0. Score is tied 0-0.\n- **Apples:** Multiple on the board. Closest apple to my head: (5, 6) is just DOWN. (4, 7) is LEFT. (5, 1) is far DOWN.\n- **Strategy:** Since scores are tied (0-0), I can't force a head-on collision yet. I need to grow first. However, I must be aggressive and position myself to dominate the board. The enemy is at (3, 9), top-left area. I am at (5, 7), center-right. I should move toward apples while cutting off the enemy's potential paths. Ideally, I want to push toward the top or center to block the enemy's expansion.\n\n**Decision Process:**\n1. **Current Position:** (5, 7).\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - **UP:** To (5, 8). Is it safe? Check board: Row 8, Col 5. Looking at the board map:\n     9 . . . 0 . . . A .\n     8 . . . . . . A . . A  <-- (5,8) is empty (dot).\n     No body collision. On board. **SAFE.**\n   - **DOWN:** To (5, 6). This is an Apple (A)!\n     6 . . . . . A . . . .\n     (5, 6) is an Apple. Moving there eats it (+1 score, +1 length). Safe otherwise.\n     **SAFE.**\n   - **LEFT:** To (4, 7).\n     7 . . . . A 1 . . . A\n     (4, 7) is an Apple (A)!\n     **SAFE.**\n   - **RIGHT:** To (6, 7).\n     6 . . . . . A . . . .\n     7 . . . . A 1 . . . A\n     (6, 7) is empty (dot). Safe.\n     **SAFE.**\n\n3. **Eliminate Unsafe Moves:** None. All moves are valid on the first turn.\n\n4. **Choose Best Safe Move:**\n   - **DOWN to (5, 6)** or **LEFT to (4, 7)** are both apples. Eating an apple early is crucial for growth and score.\n   - **UP to (5, 8)** moves me away from immediate apples and closer to the board edge (top is 9). Might limit options later.\n   - **RIGHT to (6, 7)** is safe but moves me away from the nearest apples (which are Left and Down).\n\n   Let's look at the map context.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (4, 7): I eat an apple immediately. I move closer to the enemy at (3, 9)? Distance becomes (3,9) to (4,7). The enemy is at top-left. Eating (4,7) puts me at (4,7).\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (5, 6): I eat an apple immediately. I move to (5,6).\n   - Moving **UP** to (5, 8): No apple. I go to (5,8).\n\n   The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I don't have a higher score yet. I need to grow.\n   The prompt also says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\n   Let's look at the enemy's position (3,9). The enemy is at the top row (y=9). If I move UP (5,8), I am closer to the top. If I move DOWN (5,6), I am moving away from the enemy. If I move LEFT (4,7), I am moving somewhat towards the enemy but also eating an apple.\n\n   Which direction gives me the most future options?\n   - **UP (5,8):** Neighbors: (5,9) [Up], (5,7) [Down], (4,8) [Left], (6,8) [Right].\n     - (5,9) is edge.\n     - (4,8) is empty.\n     - (6,8) is empty (dot on row 8).\n     - This puts me closer to the top edge, which might be a trap (limited vertical movement). But it puts me closer to the enemy (top of board).\n   - **DOWN (5,6):** Eats apple. Neighbors: (5,5), (5,7), (4,6), (6,6).\n     - (5,5) is empty.\n     - (4,6) is empty.\n     - (6,6) is empty.\n     - Good open space. Moving away from enemy.\n   - **LEFT (4,7):** Eats apple. Neighbors: (4,6), (4,8), (3,7), (5,7).\n     - (3,7) is empty.\n     - (4,6) is empty.\n     - (4,8) is empty.\n     - Good open space.\n     - Moving somewhat towards enemy's x-coordinate (3).\n\n   Since the scores are tied, I want to grow. Both LEFT and DOWN have apples.\n   However, the enemy is at (3,9). The board has apples at (5,6) and (4,7). Both are close.\n   If I go LEFT to (4,7), I am at (4,7). The enemy is at (3,9).\n   If I go DOWN to (5,6), I am at (5,6).\n\n   Let's consider the \"Boxing in\" strategy.\n   If I go UP, I enter the top zone. The enemy is at the top. A collision is possible. But I am currently size 1. The enemy is size 1.\n   If I go LEFT, I move towards the left side, potentially intercepting the enemy if they come down.\n   If I go DOWN, I move to the center-bottom.\n\n   The prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\n   To box him in, I should probably move towards him or cut off his access to apples.\n   However, moving directly at an enemy head when scores are equal is risky (mutual death).\n   But moving UP towards him might pressure him.\n   Let's look at the apples again.\n   (5,6) is DOWN.\n   (4,7) is LEFT.\n   (8,3), (9,7) etc are far.\n\n   If I move LEFT to (4,7):\n   - I eat an apple (Score 1-0).\n   - I am at (4,7). Enemy at (3,9).\n   - Next turn, I will have length 2.\n   - If I move UP from (4,7) to (4,8), I am getting closer to (3,9).\n   - If I move LEFT to (3,7), I am even closer to enemy's x-axis.\n   This seems like a good aggressive move to cut off the left side of the board from the enemy.\n\n   If I move DOWN to (5,6):\n   - I eat an apple (Score 1-0).\n   - I am at (5,6). Enemy at (3,9).\n   - I am moving away from the enemy. This gives the enemy more space on the top-left.\n   - The prompt wants me to \"box him in\". Moving away seems counter-intuitive to boxing him in.\n\n   If I move UP to (5,8):\n   - No apple. Score stays 0-0.\n   - I am at (5,8). Enemy at (3,9).\n   - I am very close to the enemy (distance 2).\n   - Next turn, if I move UP to (5,9), I hit the wall. If I move LEFT to (4,8), I am closer.\n   - Since I didn't eat an apple, I am smaller and potentially weaker. But I am blocking the top-center.\n\n   **Comparison:**\n   - **UP:** Aggressive positioning, no apple.\n   - **LEFT:** Aggressive positioning, Eats apple.\n   - **DOWN:** Defensive/Expansion, Eats apple.\n\n   Since the goal is to \"box him in\", moving LEFT or UP puts pressure on him.\n   LEFT seems better than UP because I get an apple (growth) while still moving somewhat towards the left side where the enemy is.\n   If I go LEFT to (4,7), I secure an apple and prepare to cut off the left side.\n   If I go UP to (5,8), I don't get an apple, and I'm near the top edge (limited mobility).\n\n   Let's commit to **LEFT**. It eats an apple, grows my snake, and moves me towards the left side of the board where the enemy is located. This positions me to potentially intercept the enemy or block their path down the left side.\n\n   **Plan:** Move LEFT to eat the apple at (4,7). Secure first point. Next turn, assess enemy movement. If enemy stays top-left, I will move UP or LEFT to cut off their vertical space.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nLEFT is safe, eats an apple, and aligns with the aggressive \"box him in\" strategy by moving towards the left side of the board.\n\n**Final Output:**\nLEFT",

I'm currently at (4,7), and I see an apple right next to me at (5,6). However, looking at the board, Snake #0 is at the top. To box them in, I need to control the space above and to the left of them. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,6), I eat the apple and grow, but I'm moving away from the enemy. That doesn't help me box them in. If I go UP to (4,8), I move towards the enemy's vertical space, cutting off their potential moves upwards. I can claim the top rows (y=8, y=9) and trap them in the corner. Since they have no body yet, I need to move fast to establish dominance in the top zone.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Move UP to (4,8) immediately. This cuts off the top-left area and positions me to intercept the enemy.\n2. The apple at (5,6) can wait; securing position against the enemy is priority #1.\n3.

We have the advantage in apples (1-0). The board is a 10x10 grid, so coordinates are (0-9, 0-9). Let's analyze the board and potential moves.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (2,8). They have no body, so they can move in any direction except potentially into walls or us if we block them. They are above us? Actually, y=8 is the same row, but x=2 is left of us (x=4). So they are to our LEFT.\nWait, looking at the board state:\nRow 8: `. . 0 . 1 . A . . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo Snake #0 is at (2,8). We (Snake #1) are at (4,8). Apples: (5,8) and (8,8) and (9,8) are on this row? No, the board shows 'A' at 6, 8, and 9? Let's map it carefully.\nRow 8: Col 2 is '0' (Snake 0), Col 4 is '1' (Us).\nCol 6 is 'A'? No, the text is \" . A . . A\". Let's re-read the board text.\nRow 8: `. . 0 . 1 . A . . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n- Index 2: '0' (Snake #0)\n- Index 4: '1' (Us)\n- Index 6: 'A' (Apple)\n- Index 9: 'A' (Apple)\nSo there are apples at (6,8) and (9,8). The apple at (5,8) is not present (it's '.'). Wait, the input says `(5,6), (1,5)...` and row 6 has an 'A' at col 0? Row 6: `A . . . . A . . . .` -> Apples at (0,6) and (5,6).\nRow 8: ` . . 0 . 1 . A . . A` -> Apples at (6,8) and (9,8).\n\n**My Move Options:**\nI am at (4,8). Valid moves must stay on board and not hit myself (I have a body at (4,7) from last turn).\n1.  **UP (4,9):** Valid (y=9 is top row). Not into myself.\n2.  **DOWN (4,7):** My body is at (4,7) (the tail). Wait, Snake #1 body: Head (4,8), Body [(4,7)].\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4,7) puts my head into my body segment. Is that allowed?\n    *   Rule: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n    *   So DOWN is a suicide move. I cannot move into my own body.\n3.  **LEFT (3,8):** Valid. Is it safe?\n    *   Snake #0 is at (2,8). They are moving this turn too.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (3,8), and Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (3,8), we collide (HEAD-ON). Both die. With my score 1 vs 0, if we both die, I win! But if Snake #0 goes UP, DOWN, or LEFT, I survive and occupy (3,8).\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am putting myself adjacent to the enemy. Risky but potentially high reward (trapping them).\n4.  **RIGHT (5,8):** Valid. There is an apple at (6,8), so moving right puts me closer to that apple.\n    *   Risk: Snake #0 is at (2,8). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, they go to (3,8). If they move RIGHT again next turn, they could threaten me. But this turn, I am at (4,8), they are at (2,8). Distance is 2 cells. They cannot reach me this turn.\n    *   Moving RIGHT seems safe from immediate collision with Snake #0.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nWe are leading 1-0. We want to be aggressive.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I cut off Snake #0's space. They are in column 2. If I move to 3, I am directly blocking their path to the right side of the board. If they go LEFT, they are closer to the wall. If they go RIGHT into me (3,8), we crash. Head-on collision favors me (1 > 0 apples).\nHowever, if I go RIGHT to (5,8), I secure the apple at (6,8) next turn (if it's still there). I also stay away from the enemy, giving me more space.\nGiven the \"aggressive\" nature, moving towards the enemy to pressure them is good.\nBut wait, Snake #0 has no body. They can turn easily. If I go LEFT to (3,8), I am effectively challenging them.\nLet's look at the board state again. Snake #0 is at (2,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8):\n- Snake #0's options: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8 - Collision).\nIf they go RIGHT, we die. Since I have more apples (1 > 0), if we BOTH die, I win (rules say snake with more apples wins). So if I can force a head-on, I should take it.\nIs moving LEFT the best way to force it? If I stay at (4,8) and move RIGHT, I am distancing myself.\nIf I move LEFT, I am entering their \"zone\".\nIs there a better move?\nWhat about UP (4,9)?\n- Snake #0 is at (2,8). They can't reach me.\n- I secure the top edge.\n- But I lose the chance to pressure them immediately.\nWhat about DOWN? Impossible (body at 4,7).\n\nLet's analyze the \"Boxing In\" plan from the prompt. \"Box him in and make him crash out\".\nTo box him in, I need to control the space.\nSnake #0 is at (2,8). The top row is y=9.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am one step closer to trapping him against the left wall or just limiting his rightward expansion.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I take the apple at (6,8) next turn. This increases my lead to 2-0. A 2-0 lead is massive.\nWait, if I take the apple at (6,8), I grow. My tail (currently at 4,7) will stay (or move depending on growth, but usually the tail moves forward unless I eat). Actually, if I eat, I grow 1, so the tail doesn't move until next turn (mechanics vary by snake version, but usually the tail stays if eating).\nIf I eat (6,8), my score becomes 2. Snake #0 is 0.\nIf I then force a head-on collision later, I win on ties.\nApple at (6,8) is RIGHT. Apple at (9,8) is further RIGHT.\nApple at (6,8) is closer.\n\nHowever, the prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating the board means controlling space.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am contesting the center of row 8.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8), I am moving away from the enemy.\nBut (5,8) is next to an apple (6,8).\nLet's check safety of LEFT (3,8).\nSnake #0 is at (2,8). If they move RIGHT, we collide. We win the tie (1 > 0). This is a GOOD outcome.\nIf they move UP (2,9) or DOWN (2,7) or LEFT (1,8), I survive and occupy (3,8).\nSo LEFT is statistically safe (3/4 chance of survival) and offers a guaranteed win on collision.\nIs there any reason NOT to go left?\nIf I go LEFT, I am putting my head right next to theirs.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP, I am at (3,8), they are at (2,9). Safe.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (5,8), they are at (2,8). Safe.\nDistance is better with RIGHT.\nBut the goal is to \"box him in\".\nIf I go RIGHT, I am letting him have the left side.\nIf I go LEFT, I am taking the space.\nI have a score advantage. A head-on collision is good for me.\nIs there a move that guarantees survival AND growth?\nRIGHT to (5,8) does not grow immediately (apple is at 6,8).\nUP to (4,9) does not grow.\nLEFT to (3,8) does not grow.\nDOWN is dead.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `. . 0 . 1 . A . . A`\nSnake #0 at 2. Me at 4.\nIf I move LEFT to 3:\nI am at (3,8).\nSnake #0's move:\n- RIGHT -> (3,8). We crash. We die. I win tie-breaker. (Result: I win the game immediately if all others die).\n- LEFT -> (1,8).\n- UP -> (2,9).\n- DOWN -> (2,7).\n\nThis looks like a strong move. I am aggressively stepping into his space.\nIf I move RIGHT to 5:\nI am at (5,8).\nSnake #0's move:\n- RIGHT -> (3,8).\n- UP -> (2,9).\n- DOWN -> (2,7).\n- LEFT -> (1,8).\nI am safe. I am closer to the apple at (6,8).\nBut I am not pressuring him.\nThe prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nPressuring him by moving LEFT seems to align with this.\nAlso, \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have a higher score (1 vs 0).\nMoving LEFT puts me in a position where if Snake #0 chooses RIGHT, we collide.\nI should take the shot.\nWait, is there a possibility of multi-snake death?\nOnly 2 snakes. If we collide, we both die.\nRule: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\nI have more apples. If we collide, I win.\nSo moving LEFT is a \"checkmate\" move if the opponent is predictable or greedy.\nHowever, smart opponents won't move into a death trap.\nIf Snake #0 sees me at (3,8) (if I move there), they won't move RIGHT. They will move UP or DOWN or LEFT.\nIf they move UP to (2,9), where am I? (3,8).\nNext turn, I can chase them.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,8), I get closer to the apple at (6,8).\nApple is content. Content is good.\nBut \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (2,8).\nMoving LEFT reduces the distance to the enemy (distance 1).\nMoving RIGHT increases the distance to the enemy (distance 3).\nUsually, in Snake, you want to control the center or block the enemy.\nGiven the small board (10x10) and the enemy being close, boxing them in is viable.\nIf I go LEFT, I claim column 3.\nIf I go RIGHT, I claim column 5.\nSnake #0 is at column 2.\nIf I claim column 3, Snake #0 is stuck in columns 0-2.\nIf I claim column 5, Snake #0 has columns 0-4 available.\nBoxing in requires taking the space *adjacent* to them.\nSo LEFT is the boxing move.\nRIGHT is the \"farm apples\" move.\nPrompt: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating the board starts with controlling space around the enemy.\nSo, LEFT seems correct for the strategy.\n\nLet's double check coordinates.\n(4,8) -> LEFT is (3,8).\n(2,8) is Snake #0.\nIs (3,8) an empty space? Yes, the board shows '.' at index 3 of row 8.\nRow 8: `. . 0 . 1 . A . . A`\nIndex 0: '.' (0,8)\nIndex 1: '.' (1,8)\nIndex 2: '0' (2,8)\nIndex 3: '.' (3,8)\nIndex 4: '1' (4,8)\nIndex 5: '.' (5,8)\nIndex 6: 'A' (6,8)\n...\nSo (3,8) is empty.\n\nWhat if I go UP to (4,9)?\nSnake #0 is at (2,8). They can go UP to (2,9).\nThen I am at (4,9), they are at (2,9).\nWe are on the same row but separated by columns.\nThis doesn't box them in. It just moves me to the edge.\nEdge play is risky.\nLEFT moves me towards the enemy and towards the center (column 3 is more central than 4? No, 4 is center).\nColumn 4 is center.\nColumn 3 is left of center.\nSnake #0 is at column 2.\nI am moving from center to left-center.\nThis is \"applying pressure\".\n\nIs there any danger in moving LEFT?\nIf Snake #0 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, I am safe.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT, I die but win (score 1 > 0).\nSo I cannot lose the game by moving LEFT (unless I die and somehow don't win the tie-breaker, but the rule says I win).\nActually, if we crash, we both die. I win because I have more apples.\nSo LEFT is a winning move mathematically in a 1v1 scenario where I have more apples.\nWait, is there any other snake? No, only #0 and #1.\nSo if I move LEFT and #0 moves RIGHT:\nWe both die -> Game Over -> I win (1 > 0).\nIf I move LEFT and #0 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT:\nI survive. I am at (3,8). I have positioned myself aggressively.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT?\nI am at (5,8).\nSnake #0 moves.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3,8), safe.\nIf I want to \"box him in\", I should have moved LEFT.\nIf I move RIGHT, I am opening up the board for him.\nHe has columns 0-4 available.\nIf I move LEFT, he has columns 0-2 available.\nThat is boxing him in.\n\nSo the choice is between:\n1.  LEFT: Aggressive, boxes in, forces a win condition on collision.\n2.  RIGHT: Safe, goes for apple at (6,8), but less pressure on enemy.\n3.  UP: Safe, goes to edge, less pressure.\n\nThe prompt emphasizes aggression and boxing him in.\n\"WE GOTTA MAKE A PLAN TO BOX HIM IN\"\nMoving towards the enemy to cut off space is boxing him in.\nMoving away (RIGHT) is the opposite of boxing him in.\nMoving UP (to edge) is not boxing him in (he can go left/down).\nMoving LEFT (to 3,8) cuts off his rightward expansion.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (3,8), and he goes UP to (2,9).\nNext turn I can go UP to (3,9) or LEFT to (2,8).\nIf I go UP to (3,9), I am above him? No, he is at (2,9), I am at (3,9).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8), I chase him.\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nLet's review the \"Apple drops\" list.\nApples are (5,6), (1,5), (8,3), (9,7), (7,4), (5,1), (7,9), (7,2), (3,3), (5,3), (0,1), (6,8), (9,2), (9,8), (0,6).\nThere is an apple at (6,8). This is to my RIGHT.\nThere is an apple at (9,8). Far right.\nThere is an apple at (5,6). Down-right.\nThere is an apple at (0,6). Far left.\nThere is an apple at (7,9). Up-right.\nThere is an apple at (3,3). Down-left.\n\nBy moving LEFT, I am moving towards the left side of the board (where (0,6) and (3,3) are), but away from (6,8) and (9,8).\nHowever, the immediate goal is to trap Snake #0.\nSnake #0 is at (2,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I am closer to (0,6) apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am closer to (6,8) apple.\nBut Snake #0 is between me and the left side apples.\nIf I go LEFT, I am engaging Snake #0.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am ignoring Snake #0 to eat an apple.\nPrompt: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nI should focus on Snake #0.\nSo I should move towards Snake #0 or block him.\nMoving LEFT is moving towards him (distance decreases from 2 to 1).\nMoving RIGHT is moving away (distance increases from 2 to 3).\n\nIs there any scenario where moving LEFT is bad?\nIf Snake #0 is suicidal and moves RIGHT, I win instantly. Good.\nIf Snake #0 is smart, he moves UP/DOWN/LEFT.\nIf he moves UP to (2,9), I am at (3,8).\nI am below and to the right of him.\nI can chase him up.\nIf he moves LEFT to (1,8), I am at (3,8).\nI am to his right.\nI can chase him left.\nThis puts me in a dominating position.\n\nLet's consider the \"Turn 2\" aspect.\nGame is young.\nSnake #0 has no body.\nI have a body at (4,7).\nIf I move LEFT to (3,8):\nMy body will become [(4,8), (4,7)] (assuming I don't eat).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,8):\nMy body will become [(4,8), (4,7)].\nBody size is 2.\nSmall body means high mobility.\n\nLet's check the board for traps.\nRow 8 is open.\nRow 9 is the top wall.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I am not near a wall.\nIf I go UP to (4,9), I am on the wall.\nWall play is dangerous (limited moves).\nSo UP is worse than LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSo the decision is LEFT vs RIGHT.\nLEFT: Aggressive, follows \"box him in\" strategy, puts pressure on enemy, sets up potential instant win if enemy misplays.\nRIGHT: Passive, follows \"grow\" strategy, gets apple at (6,8) next turn, ignores enemy.\n\nThe prompt explicitly says:\n\"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n\"Box him in.\"\n\"Be aggressive.\"\nThese keywords strongly point to moving towards the enemy or blocking him.\nMoving LEFT is the only move that blocks him (cuts off his right side).\nMoving RIGHT lets him have the right side.\nMoving UP lets him have the top side (though I take top row, he can stay at y=8).\nMoving LEFT restricts his x-axis movement significantly.\n\nSo I will move LEFT.\n\nWait, let's check the board one more time.\nRow 8: `. . 0 . 1 . A . . A`\nSnake #0 at 2. Me at 4.\nIf I go LEFT, I go to 3.\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT, we crash.\nI have 1 apple, they have 0.\nI win.\nIf I don't go LEFT, I miss this opportunity to pressure.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at 5.\nSnake #0 is at 2.\nHe has 3 columns of space (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, I am at 5, so he can go to 3, 4).\nIf I am at 5, he is at 2.\nHe can move to 3, 4, 1, 0, (2,9), (2,7).\nHe has plenty of space.\nIf I am at 3, he is at 2.\nHe can move to 1, 0, (2,9), (2,7). He CANNOT move to 3 (I am there) or 4 (I am at 3, so 4 is open but I am blocking 3).\nWait, if I am at 3, he is at 2.\nHe can move to 1, 0, (2,9), (2,7).\nHe is restricted to columns 0, 1, 2 and rows 7, 8, 9.\nThat is boxing him in.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nIf I survive at (3,8), look at Snake #0's new position.\nIf he is at (2,9), I might go UP to (3,9) or LEFT to (2,8) (if empty).\nIf he is at (2,7), I might go DOWN or LEFT.\nIf he is at (1,8), I go LEFT to (2,8).\nBasically, chase him.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\n```",

Score is 0-1 in their favor, so we gotta pressure without getting boxed in.\n\nSafety check on all four ways:\n- UP to (2,9): safe, but puts us up high with less immediate pressure on him.\n- LEFT to (1,8): safe, starts closing the gap on the left flank and nudges him toward edge play.\n- DOWN to (2,7): safe, keeps central control but might open easier chase lines for him.\n- RIGHT to (3,8): could invite a head-on if he decides to chase left into (3,8); high risk of mutual KO.\n\nFrom a risk/reward view, RIGHT is the riskiest and least controllable this turn. UP is safe but less aggressive. DOWN is fine but doesn\u2019t press. LEFT gives us immediate pressure on the left flank and keeps multiple escape routes open while steering the fight toward the edge where we can box him in later. So we go LEFT.\n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE\nWe\u2019re behind on the scoreboard, so we need to assert control without getting tangled in a bad head-on. From (2,8) the SAFE options are UP, LEFT, or DOWN; RIGHT is risky due to potential head-on with the rival if he mirrors left to (3,8). LEFT (to 1,8) shaves off space on his right, nudges him toward the edge when we tighten the pressure on future turns, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups. We stay aggressive but mindful of the board geometry and his one-body constraint. The long-term plan is to corral him into a corner by alternating sides and leveraging apples to force him into suboptimal moves without sacrificing our own safety.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

My body is at (4,8). That's suicide! **DEADLY.**\n    *   *Correction:* My body is at (4,8). If I move RIGHT to (4,8), I hit my own body. **RIGHT IS DEATH.**\n    *   *Correction 2:* My head is at (3,8). My body is at (4,8). If I move RIGHT, I go to (4,8). That is my body. I die. **RIGHT IS ELIMINATED.**\n\n**2. STRATEGY & APPLE HUNTING:**\n*   **Apple Map:** Apples are everywhere. I'm not just hunting apples, I'm hunting the enemy.\n*   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (1,8). He has 0 apples. I have 1. I win ties.\n*   **The \"Box Him In\" Plan:** He is on the left side (x=1). I am at (x=3). If I move **LEFT** to (2,8), I cut off his escape route to the right. I trap him against the left wall.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,8):\n        *   Enemy at (1,8) cannot move RIGHT into me (collision). He must go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n        *   If he goes LEFT to (0,8), he's cornered against the wall at x=0.\n        *   If he goes UP/DOWN, I can chase him next turn.\n    *   If I go UP to (3,9): I take the top wall. Enemy stays at (1,8). He has free roam of row 8 and 7. I lose control.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,7): Enemy is at (1,8). He can move anywhere. I lose proximity.\n\n**3. THE DECISION:**\nI have a score advantage (1-0). The prompt says \"Force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nMoving **LEFT** into (2,8) puts me right next to him.\nIf he moves RIGHT into (2,8) at the same time, we crash. We both die. Since I have more apples (1 > 0), I win the tie-breaker.\nIf he plays safe and goes UP, DOWN, or LEFT, I have successfully \"boxed him in\" on the left side of the board. I cut off his right flank.\n\nMoving RIGHT is death.\nMoving UP or DOWN is passive and gives him space.\n**LEFT** is aggressive, controls space, and offers a winning collision. It follows the \"Box him in\" directive perfectly.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nIf I survive at (2,8), I will look to chase Snake #0 based on his move. If he went UP to (1,9), I go UP. If he went DOWN to (1,7), I go DOWN. If he went LEFT to (0,8), I go LEFT to (1,8). I will maintain pressure until he crashes.\n\nI'm going for the throat. Cutting off his right side.\n\nLEFT",

I have 1 apple. Opponent (ID 0) is at (0, 8).\n\n**1. SAFETY CHECK (Don't die!):**\n*   **UP (2, 9):** On board? Yes. Into my body? No (Body is at 3,8). Into enemy body?

No (Body is at 3,8). Into enemy body? No. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** On board? Yes. Into my body? **YES!** My body segment is exactly at (3,8). If I move right, I hit my own tail. **DEADLY.**\n\nRight is eliminated immediately. I cannot move into my own body.\n\n**2. STRATEGY & THE ARCHRIVAL:**\nThe plan was to box him in and force a collision since I have the score advantage (1-0).\n*   **Enemy Position:** (0, 8). He is cornered on the left wall.\n*   **Current Threat:** I am at (2, 8). If I move **LEFT** to (1, 8), I become the wall. I am literally squishing him against the left edge of the board (x=0).\n*   **The Trap:**\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (1, 8):\n        *   He is at (0, 8).\n        *   He cannot move LEFT (off board).\n        *   He cannot move RIGHT (into me at 1,8).\n        *   He is forced to move UP or DOWN.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (2, 9): He is at (0, 8). He has room to move RIGHT to (1,8) or DOWN to (0,7). I lose pressure.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (2, 7): He is at (0, 8). He has room to move. I lose pressure.\n\n**3. THE DECISION:**\nI need to execute the \"Box Him In\" plan perfectly. By moving **LEFT** to (1, 8), I occupy the cell immediately to his right. This cuts off his escape route and forces him into a corner. Since he has no body segments (he's just a head), he has to move Up or Down. I will then be perfectly positioned to chase him down on the next turn.\n\nAlso, looking at the apples:\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (1, 8) puts me closer to the apple at (1, 5) (directly below me eventually) and blocks the apple at (0, 6) if he tries to go down.\n*   Moving **UP** to (2, 9) puts me against the wall and away from the central cluster.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (2, 7) is safer but less aggressive. I need to apply pressure.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nBy moving **LEFT**, I am forcing him to choose a direction. If he is suicidal and tries to turn back into me next turn, I win the collision. If he runs, I have him trapped on the edge.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove **LEFT** to (1, 8) to cut off his right side and trap him against the wall. Wait for his move. If he moves UP to (0,9), I will chase UP. If he moves DOWN to (0,7), I will chase DOWN. I will maintain this pressure until he crashes or I eat an apple while dominating the board.\n\nI'm going for the throat. Cutting off his right side.\n\nLEFT",

I have successfully pushed him down the wall and I am perfectly positioned to continue the chase downwards.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nPush him into the corner at (0,0) or force a head-on collision where I have the score advantage.

BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (0, 8), Body at (1, 8). I just moved Left into the perfect trap position.\n*   **Opponent Position:** Head at (0, 6), Body at (0, 7).\n*   **Score:** Me: 1, Them: 1. We are tied. **Crucial detail:** Head-on collisions this turn result in **DOUBLE DEATH** because we have equal points. I must avoid a collision unless I can guarantee I win (which I can't right now).\n\n**2. SAFETY CHECK (Don't throw the lead):**\n*   **UP (0, 9):** On board? Yes. Into my body? No (Body is at 1, 8). Into enemy? No (Enemy is at 0, 6). **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN (0, 7):** On board? Yes. Into my body? No (Body is at 1, 8). Into enemy? **YES!** Enemy body segment is at (0, 7). If I move here, I die. **DEADLY.**\n*   **LEFT (-1, 8):** On board? No. Off the map. **DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT (1, 8):** On board? Yes. Into my body? **YES!** My body segment is at (1, 8). I cannot move into myself. **DEADLY.**\n\n**3. STRATEGY & THE PLAY:**\nMy trap worked, but the opponent is smart. He slid down to (0, 6) instead of moving up into me. This puts us in a stalemate on the left wall. I cannot move down (into his body) or right (into my own body).\n\nMy **only** safe move is **UP** to (0, 9).\n\n*   **If I move UP to (0, 9):**\n    *   I reach the top-left corner. I am safe.\n    *   My body moves: Head becomes (0, 9), Body becomes [(0, 8)], Tail moves off (1, 8).\n    *   **The Trap Remains:** I am still vertically aligned with him. He is at (0, 6), and my new body is at (0, 8).\n    *   Next turn, he has to move. If he moves UP, he hits my body (0, 8) and dies. If he moves DOWN, he goes to (0, 5). If he moves RIGHT, he escapes the wall.\n    *   By moving UP, I secure my safety and maintain pressure. I am cutting off his escape upwards. I force him to either go deeper into the corner or try to slip under me.\n\n**4. LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to secure the corner. My body will block the column at x=0, y=8. Next turn, if he moves DOWN, I will chase him down. If he moves RIGHT, I will hunt him down. I need to eat an apple soon to break the score tie and enable aggressive head-on collisions. There is an apple at (0, 1) far below, but getting there will require navigating past him. For now, secure position.\n\n**Chat, watch this safe play! I'm holding the line!**\n\nUP",

SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   **UP (0, 10):** On board? **NO.** Off the map (y=9 max). **DEADLY.**\n*   **DOWN (0, 8):** On board? Yes.

Yes. Into my body? No. Into enemy body? Enemy body is at y=6, so (2, 9) is clear.\n- *Verdict:* SAFE. This opens up the entire right side of the board (x=2 to x=9).

I need to bridge that gap.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nMy head is at (2, 9). My body is at (1, 9) and (0, 9). The opponent's head is at (3, 6).\nLet's look at my options:\n\n1.  **LEFT (1, 9):** **DEAD.** My body is sitting at (1, 9). I cannot go there.\n2.  **RIGHT (3, 9):** **SAFE.** This is the critical move. I am moving *away* from the opponent who is at (3, 6). This opens up the top right quadrant for me.\n    *   *Collision Check:* The opponent is at (3, 6). If they move UP, they go to (3, 7). If they move UP again, they go to (3, 8). If they move UP *again*, they hit (3, 9). By the time they get there, I will have moved on or grown. Even if we somehow met at (3, 9) immediately, the opponent is at (3, 6) right now, so they cannot reach (3, 9) in one move.\n    *   *Future Options:* From (3, 9), I can go RIGHT to (4, 9), DOWN to (3, 8), or LEFT to (2, 9). Great maneuverability.\n3.  **DOWN (2, 8):** **SAFE.** This moves me toward the center of the board.\n    *   *Collision Check:* The opponent is at (3, 6). If they move UP to (3, 7), we are still separated. However, if they move LEFT to (2, 6), I might get boxed in later.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Moving DOWN to (2, 8) keeps me close to the left side, but the opponent is already establishing a vertical line near there (x=2, x=3).\n4.  **UP (2, 10):** **DEAD.** Off the map.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am choosing **RIGHT**. The opponent is currently at (3, 6). I am at (2, 9). Moving to (3, 9) maximizes my distance from them and gives me control of the upper-right quadrant. If I move DOWN, I risk running into their vertical approach. I need to sweep the board and find apples (look at those apples at (9,8) and (9,7)!). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to those high-value targets on the right side of the board.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nSweep rightwards along the top edge (y=9). Once I reach x=6 or x=7, start moving DOWN to hunt the apples at (7, 9), (9, 8), and (7, 7). Watch the enemy's vertical movement.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT would crash into your own neck.\nREASONING: Staying CENTER gives you multiple escape options and nudges you toward the tempting apple at (5,6) without giving the rival a clean box-in path yet.\nRIVAL ANALYSIS: They can go to (2,8) or (3,9) this turn. No immediate head-on crash threat this turn, so we keep pressure while avoiding traps.\nSTRATEGY: Take RIGHT to shift toward the apple lane and keep open pivots for future box moves.

There's an apple at (7, 9) (2 steps right) and (9, 8) (2 right, 1 down).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (OPTIONS FROM 4,9):**\n1.  **UP (4, 10):** **DEAD.** Off the top of the map.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 8):** **SAFE.** Open space. (Note: My tail will move from (3,9) to (4,9) because I ate an apple recently? No, I ate an apple *previously*, but wait... looking at the board, there is no apple at (4,9). My tail is currently at (3,9). If I move DOWN to (4,8), my body shifts. The cell (4,9) becomes the new \"neck\", and my old neck (3,9) becomes the body. The tail (3,9) moves to (4,9)? Wait, let's trace the body. Head (4,9) -> Body (3,9). The tail is (3,9). If I move DOWN to (4,8), the new head is (4,8). The body becomes (4,9). The tail (3,9) gets removed unless I eat an apple. So (3,9) becomes empty. This is SAFE.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 9):** **DEAD.** Runs directly into my own body (currently at 3,9).\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 9):** **SAFE.** Moves me closer to the apples at (7,9) and (9,9). The cell (5,9) is empty.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nEnemy Head is at (5,6).\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (5,9): Enemy would have to move UP 3 times to (5,9). Impossible in one turn.\n- If I move **DOWN** to (4,8): Enemy would have to move UP 2 and LEFT 1 to (4,8). Impossible in one turn.\n- **Crucial Note:** The enemy is directly below me (same X coordinate 4/5, but distance is large). If I stay on the edge, I limit their angle of attack. If I go down into the center, I open myself up to potential flanking later.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to box the enemy out. The enemy is at (5,6) on the left-center. I am on the top-right edge.\n- Moving **RIGHT** claims the top-right corner. There is an apple at (7,9) which is 3 steps away. If I go RIGHT now, I set up to eat that apple soon.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4,8) is safe, but it moves me away from the corner apples and towards the center where the enemy is. The enemy is at (5,6). If I go to (4,8), I am closer to them. I want to separate the board. Top edge vs. Center.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am taking **RIGHT**. I need to secure the perimeter. The enemy is slow (length 4) and trapped in the left sector. I need to sweep the top row to grab apples and deny territory. (5,9) is empty, safe, and maintains my dominance of the high ground.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apples along the top edge (7,9) -> (9,8) -> (9,2). Force the enemy into the bottom-left corner. If they try to climb the right wall, I cut them off.\n\n**MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

They cannot move LEFT (blocked by their own body) or off the board. Their safe options next turn are DOWN to (4,8) or RIGHT to (5,9). We\u2019re currently above them, so moving UP keeps us out of immediate danger and gives us room to pressure without a head-on collision this turn.\n- STRATEGY: We\u2019re up 3 apples to 1.

If I move DOWN to (5, 8) and they move UP to (5, 8), we have a **HEAD-ON COLLISION**. That's a Double KO. I have 1 apple, they have 3. I lose the tie-breaker. I cannot trade here.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 9):** **SAFE (Sort of).** This is my tail's current position. As I move Left, my tail (currently at the end of my body) will move forward to vacate the cell (4, 9). Wait, let's trace my body carefully. Head (5, 9) -> Body (4, 9). The tail is (4, 9). If I move LEFT to (4, 9), I am moving into my own tail. **Rule check:** \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" Since I am exactly length 2, moving back onto my tail cell counts as hitting myself. **DEADLY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9):** **SAFE.** The cell (6, 9) is empty. No threats.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nI am pinned on the top edge. The opponent is vertically aligned at X=5. They are likely trying to cut off my access to the right side or force a collision.\n*   If I go **LEFT**, I die by hitting my tail.\n*   If I go **DOWN**, I risk a Double KO. Even if I win the math (1 vs 3 is a loss, actually), I die. I need to survive to eat more apples. They have 3 apples, I have 1. I cannot afford a trade yet. I need to outgrow them safely.\n*   If I go **RIGHT**, I escape the vertical threat. I am moving away from the opponent. The cell (6, 9) is open. From there, I can access the apple at (7, 9) or turn down towards (9, 8).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (6, 9) to avoid the opponent at X=5. Secure the top-right corner. Loop around to eat the apples on the right side to equalize the score. Once I have a size advantage, I can box them in.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am taking **RIGHT**. It's the only move that guarantees survival and keeps me in the game to chase those apples. I'm avoiding the suicide left and the risky down.\n\nRIGHT",

However, moving DOWN opens up the right side of the board for me. I need to consider if this is a trap.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 9):** **RISKY.** This is my tail's current position. As I move Left, my tail (currently at (5, 9)) will move forward. Wait, my body is [(5, 9)]. The tail is (5, 9). If I move LEFT to (5, 9), I am moving into my own tail.

They are trying to box me in or force a collision.\n*   Moving **DOWN** is risky because of the potential head-on collision with the opponent moving RIGHT. While I *might* survive if they don't move right, why risk it when I have a guaranteed safe, scoring move?\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 9) is the winning play. It's an apple, it's safe (off the board is the only threat to the right, and I'm at 7,9), and it extends my length. By eating the apple, I grow to length 3, putting me slightly closer to matching their size.\n*   Moving **LEFT** is suicide.\n*   Moving **UP** is impossible.\n\nMy plan is to eat the apple at (7, 9) to grow and secure the top-right corner. From there, I can look to drop down towards (9, 8) or (9, 7).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am taking **RIGHT** to eat the apple and expand my territory. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

If I move LEFT, I go to (6, 9). That is currently occupied by my own body (segment 1). I cannot move into my own body. **DEADLY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 9):** **SAFE.** Currently empty. Off the board is (10, 9) so I'm safe at the edge. This moves me to the very right edge.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nThe opponent is at (6, 8). They are close. If I go DOWN to (7, 8), I risk a head-on collision if they go RIGHT. That's bad news because I'm behind in score. If I go RIGHT to (8, 9), I secure the corner and get closer to the apple at (9, 8). From (8, 9), I can easily drop down to (8, 8) or (8, 7) next turn. Moving RIGHT keeps me on the perimeter, which is safer from their vertical lineup on the left.\n\nMy plan is to secure the right side. I'll move RIGHT to (8, 9). From there, I can threaten the apple at (9, 8) or (8, 7) and keep distance from the enemy.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am taking **RIGHT** to claim the corner!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to play this perfectly to avoid a head-on collision.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** (8, 9)\n2.  **Opponent Position:** (7, 8)\n3.  **Opponent Body:** [(6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)] - Note: I suspect the opponent's tail is at (5, 6), meaning the cell (4, 6) is now safe/empty (since they grew last turn).\n4.  **Threat Analysis:** The opponent is moving UP from (7, 8) to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8). If I move DOWN to (8, 8), we collide with their potential RIGHT move. If I move LEFT to (7, 9), we collide with their potential UP move (and the grid shows \"T\" at 7,9 from previous move, but that's my tail). Actually, looking at the board state provided:\n    *   My head is at (8,9). My body is [(7,9), (6,9)].\n    *   Opponent head is at (7,8). Opponent body is [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)].\n    *   Wait, the board state shows `9 . . . . . . T T 1 .` and `8 . . . . . T T 0 . A`.\n    *   My head is 1 at (8,9). My body is T at (7,9) and (6,9).\n    *   Enemy head is 0 at (7,8). Enemy body is T at (6,8) and others.\n\n    **Check Moves from (8,9):**\n    *   **UP:** (8, 10) - Off board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (8, 8) - Look at board: `8 . . . . . T T 0 A`. (8,8) is currently empty (0 is at 7,8, T is at 6,8). Is it safe? The enemy is at (7,8). If they move RIGHT, they go to (8,8). If I move DOWN to (8,8), we collide. Since I have fewer apples (2 vs 4), I lose the tie-breaker. **RISKY (Head-on collision possible).**\n    *   **LEFT:** (7, 9) - Look at board: `9 . . . . . . T T 1 .`. (7,9) is my own body (the first T). Moving into my own body kills me. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (9, 9) - Look at board: `9 . . . . . . T T 1 .`. (9,9) is currently empty (1 is at 8,9). It's the corner. Is it safe?\n        *   Enemy at (7,8) cannot reach (9,9) in one move.\n        *   Enemy body doesn't touch (9,9).\n        *   Moving to (9,9) keeps me away from the enemy's immediate location.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to avoid the head-on collision. Moving DOWN to (8,8) is dangerous because the enemy might move RIGHT (or DOWN). The enemy is at (7,8), and there's an apple at (8,8)? No, looking at the `APPLE DROPS` list, (8,8) is NOT an apple. The apples are: (1,5), (8,3), (9,7), (7,4), (5,1), (7,2), (3,3), (5,3), (0,1), (9,2), (9,8), (1,3), (8,7), (7,5), (2,3).\nThe board shows `8 . . . . . T T 0 A`. Wait, the A at the end of row 8? Let's check coordinates.\nRow 8 (y=8): Index 0 to 9.\nThe string is ` . . . . . T T 0 . A`.\n(0,8): .\n...\n(6,8): T\n(7,8): 0 (Enemy Head)\n(8,8): .\n(9,8): A (Apple)\n\nSo there IS an apple at (9,8). Wait, no. The string shows `0 . A`.\n(7,8) is 0.\n(8,8) is .\n(9,8) is A.\n\nWait, let me re-read the map text carefully.\nRow 8: ` . . . . . T T 0 . A`\nPositions:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: .\n5: T\n6: T\n7: 0\n8: .\n9: A\n\nSo (9,8) is an apple! And (8,8) is empty.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (9,9):\nI am safe. I am not colliding.\nHowever, I am missing the apple at (9,8).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (8,8):\nI am putting my head in the path of the enemy.\nIf the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (8,8), I die (I have 2 apples, they have 4).\nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (7,9), I live (but I'm at 8,8).\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (7,7), I live.\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6,8), I live.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,8). They are right next to me.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9), I am putting distance between us.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8), I am closing the gap and risking a head-on collision.\n\nGiven the score is 2-4, I cannot afford a head-on collision. I must play safe.\nMoving RIGHT to (9,9) is the only safe move that doesn't risk immediate death by collision or wall.\nWait, what about LEFT? (7,9) is my body. I die.\nWhat about UP? Off board. I die.\n\nSo the choice is strictly between DOWN and RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,8), and the enemy goes RIGHT to (8,8), I lose.\nIf the enemy goes UP to (7,9), I survive.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (7,7), I survive.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (6,8), I survive.\n\nIs there any info on what the enemy will do?\nThe enemy is at (7,8). Apple at (9,8) is to their right. Apple at (8,7) is down-right. Apple at (7,5) is down.\nIf the enemy wants the apple at (9,8), they would move RIGHT (to 8,8) then RIGHT (to 9,8). Or they might move UP to (7,9) to chase something else? No, (7,9) is my body.\nActually, looking at the board, there is an apple at (8,7) and (7,5).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, they go to (7,7). From there they can get (8,7) or (7,5).\nIf they move RIGHT, they go to (8,8). From there they can get (9,8) or (8,7).\n\nI am at (8,9). If I move RIGHT to (9,9), I am safe. I am not eating an apple this turn, but I am surviving.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8), I might eat the apple at (8,8)? No, the map says (8,8) is empty. Wait, the map shows `8 . . . . . T T 0 . A`.\nWait, let me check the apple list again: `APPLE DROPS: (1, 5), (8, 3), (9, 7), (7, 4), (5, 1), (7, 2), (3, 3), (5, 3), (0, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8), (1, 3), (8, 7), (7, 5), (2, 3)`\n(9,8) IS an apple!\n(8,8) is NOT an apple.\n\nSo if I move DOWN to (8,8), I am moving to an empty square and putting my head in range of the enemy.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9), I am moving to an empty square and moving away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy has a longer body. They are more likely to make a mistake if I keep distance. Since I am losing in score, I need to survive. A head-on collision guarantees my loss (2 < 4).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only safe move that avoids a guaranteed loss (on a tie) is RIGHT. Moving DOWN creates a potential tie-loss scenario if the enemy moves RIGHT. Moving RIGHT guarantees survival for this turn.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 8: ` . . . . . T T 0 . A`\nThis means (8,8) is empty.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I go to (9,9).\nIs (9,9) empty?\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . . T T 1 .`\nWait, the head is at 8. The T's are at 6 and 7.\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nRow 9: ` . . . . . . T T 1 .`\n(6,9): T\n(7,9): T\n(8,9): 1 (My Head)\n(9,9): .\n\nSo (9,9) is empty.\n\nIf I move **DOWN**, I go to (8,8).\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I go to (9,9).\n\nThe enemy is at (7,8). They can move to (8,8) (Right), (7,9) (Up), (7,7) (Down), (6,8) (Left).\n(7,9) is my body (implied by T in that spot, or my body list says [(7,9), (6,9)]). So enemy UP is into my body -> Enemy dies. This is good for me.\nBut if enemy goes RIGHT to (8,8), and I go DOWN to (8,8), I die.\n\nThe probability of the enemy going RIGHT is high because there is an apple at (9,8) just two steps away (Right, Right).\nThere is also an apple at (8,7) (Right, Down).\nThere is an apple at (7,5) (Down, Down).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9), I am safe. I am also closer to the apple at (9,8).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,8), they are closer to (9,8).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,7), they are closer to (8,7) or (7,5).\n\nI should not risk a head-on collision when I am behind in score.\nTherefore, I will move **RIGHT** to (9,9).\n\nWait, checking the board state text again.\n`9 . . . . . . T T 1 .`\nIndices: 0123456789\nT is at 6, T is at 7, 1 is at 8. 9 is empty.\n`8 . . . . . T T 0 . A`\n0 is at 7, A is at 9.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9), I am safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8), I am stepping into a \"kill zone\" if the enemy moves right.\n\nLet's look at the body positions.\nMy body: [(7, 9), (6, 9)]\nEnemy body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)]\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9):\nMy head moves to (9,9). My tail moves from (6,9) to (7,9)? No, if I don't eat an apple, my tail follows the head.\nCurrent: Head (8,9) -> Body (7,9) -> Body (6,9).\nNext (if no eat): Head (9,9) -> Body (8,9) -> Body (7,9).\nThis means (6,9) becomes empty.\nEnemy is at (7,8). They cannot hit me.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,8):\nMy head moves to (8,8).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (8,8), collision. I lose (2 < 4).\nWhy would I ever risk that?\n\nMoving RIGHT is the only rational choice to ensure I don't lose immediately based on opponent movement.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (9,9). Secure the corner. Watch the enemy. If they crash into me or the wall, I win. If they survive, I'll look to get the apple at (9,8) or (8,7) next turn.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am moving **RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

I am currently winning 2-0! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **Me:** Head at (9,9), Body at [(8,9), (7,9)].\n    *   **Enemy:** Head at (8,8), Body at [(7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7)].\n    *   **Score:** Me 2, Enemy 0. **I am winning.** \ud83d\udcb0\n\n2.  **Analyze Moves from (9,9):**\n    *   **UP:** (9,10) - **Wall.** Dead. \u274c\n    *   **LEFT:** (8,9) - **My Body.** Dead. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** (9,8) - **Check Board:** Row 8 shows ` . . . . . T T 0 8 A`. (9,8) is an Apple! (The A at the end). Is it safe from the enemy? Enemy is at (8,8). They are RIGHT next to me. If the Enemy moves **RIGHT** to (9,8), we collide.\n        *   **Head-on Collision Rule:** If two heads move into the same cell, *both* die. If ALL snakes die, the one with the most apples wins.\n        *   I have 2 apples, Enemy has 0 apples. **If we both die, I WIN.** \ud83d\udc80\n        *   *However*, the prompt says \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" This is good strategy.\n        *   But wait, if I move DOWN to (9,8) and the Enemy moves **UP** to (8,9)? No, Enemy is at (8,8), UP is (8,9). (8,9) is MY body. The Enemy would die by hitting my body. That is an INSTANT WIN for me. \ud83d\udcaf\n        *   If Enemy moves **DOWN** to (8,7) or **LEFT** to (7,8), they survive, and I get the Apple at (9,8), growing to 3 apples. This is also good.\n        *   So, moving DOWN guarantees I either Win (if Enemy moves Right or Up into me/my body) or Gain an Apple (if Enemy moves Left or Down).\n\n    *   **RIGHT:** (10,9) - **Wall.** Dead. \u274c\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   The only legal move is **DOWN** to (9,8).\n    *   This position puts me directly adjacent to the enemy's head.\n    *   I have the score advantage (2 > 0).\n    *   If the enemy moves into me or my body, I win.\n    *   If the enemy moves away, I eat the apple and extend my lead.\n    *   There is no scenario where moving DOWN causes *only me* to die (unless I move into my own tail, which I'm not). The only way I die is if the enemy moves into (9,8) at the same time as me (Double KO -> I Win).\n\n4.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Is (9,8) empty of my body? Yes, my body is (8,9) and (7,9).\n    *   Is (9,8) an apple? Yes (based on the map display).\n    *   Is it aggressive? Yes.\n    *   Does it secure victory? If enemy plays recklessly, yes. If they play safe, I grow.\n\n    **PLAN:** Move DOWN to (9,8). The enemy is at (8,8). If they move RIGHT, we tie-die, but I win on apples (2-0). If they move UP, they hit my body and die instantly. If they move DOWN or LEFT, I eat the apple and extend my lead. I am forcing the enemy into a corner. Let's see if they choke! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

I just moved DOWN from (9,9) to (9,8). Wait... hold up. Let me check the board state provided.\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . T T T`\nRow 8: `. . . A . T T T T 1`\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n*   **My Head:** The board shows my head is at **(9,8)** (the '1' at the end of row 8).\n*   **My Body:** Looking at row 9, I see 'T' (tail) positions. The prompt says my body is `[(9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]`.\n    *   Wait, if my head is at (9,8), and my body list is `[(9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]`, that means my body segments are at (9,9), (8,9), and (7,9).\n    *   However, the board shows `(9,9)` is a 'T' (Tail), `(8,9)` is 'T', `(7,9)` is 'T'. The board doesn't show a snake head at (9,8) in the list? The '1' at (9,8) represents my head.\n\n**Let's re-read the prompt carefully.**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n- Head: **(9, 8)**\n- Body: **[(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]**\n\nOkay, I am currently at **(9, 8)**. I just moved there (or this is the state for Turn 17).\nWait, the prompt says: \"Turn: 17 / 150\". \"YOUR LAST MOVE... DOWN\".\n\nLet's look at the opponent.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (8, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** `[(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)]`\n\n**Distance Check:**\nI am at (9, 8). Enemy is at (8, 7).\n*   Horizontal distance: 1 (9 - 8)\n*   Vertical distance: 1 (8 - 7)\n*   We are diagonal neighbors.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Moves from (9, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** (9, 9). Is it safe?\n        *   My body includes (9, 9). **CRASH!** I would die. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** (9, 7).\n        *   Is it a wall? No, y=7 is valid.\n        *   Is it my body? No (Body is at y=8,9).\n        *   Is it Enemy body? Enemy body is at (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7). (9,7) is empty of enemy body.\n        *   Is it Enemy Head? Enemy Head is at (8,7). (9,7) is adjacent.\n        *   **Risk:** If Enemy moves **RIGHT** to (9,7), we head-on collision -> Double KO.\n        *   **Score Check:** Me 3 apples, Enemy 5 apples. **I AM LOSING.**\n        *   **Head-on Collision Rule:** If both die, the one with *more* apples wins.\n        *   **If we head-on collide, ENEMY WINS (5 > 3).**\n        *   Therefore, I must avoid a head-on collision at all costs if it results in my loss.\n        *   Can I survive (9,7)? Yes, it's a valid move.\n    *   **LEFT:** (8, 8).\n        *   Is it safe? Enemy body is at (8, 8). **CRASH!** I die. \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT:** (10, 8). **Wall.** Dead. \u274c\n\n2.  **ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS:**\n    *   The only legal moves that don't kill me immediately are **DOWN** to (9, 7).\n    *   However, **DOWN** to (9, 7) puts me directly to the right of the enemy's head (8, 7).\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 7), we collide.\n    *   **SCORE IMPLICATION:** Enemy has 5 apples, I have 3. If we collide, Enemy wins.\n    *   **Therefore, I CANNOT allow a collision.** I must force the enemy to move elsewhere or move to a position where they cannot collide with me (or where a collision results in a draw, but strictly speaking, I can't win a draw with fewer apples).\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   I am currently in a bad spot. My only move is DOWN.\n    *   I need to anticipate where the enemy will go.\n    *   The enemy is at (8, 7).\n    *   The enemy likely wants to eat apples or kill me.\n    *   Apples near enemy: (8, 3), (7, 4), (7, 2), (3, 3), (5, 3), (0, 1), (1, 3), (7, 5), (2, 3), (7, 7), (3, 8).\n    *   Apples near me: (9, 7) - which is the cell I'm moving into!\n    *   Wait, looking at the board:\n        *   Row 7: `. . . . . T . A 0 A`\n        *   The 'A' at (8, 7) is gone? No, the board is static.\n        *   Actually, look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list: `(9, 7)` is NOT in the list.\n        *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 7: `7 . . . . . T . A 0 A`\n        *   Coordinates: (0,7) to (9,7).\n        *   (8,7) is '0' (Enemy Head).\n        *   (9,7) is 'A' (Apple!).\n    *   **If I move DOWN to (9, 7):**\n        *   I will eat the apple at (9, 7).\n        *   My score becomes 4.\n        *   Enemy score is 5.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 7), we collide.\n        *   **Scenario A (Double KO):** I die, Enemy dies. Scores: Me 4, Enemy 5. **Enemy wins.** (Because 5 > 4).\n        *   **Scenario B (I survive, Enemy moves elsewhere):** I eat the apple. Score 4 vs 5.\n    *   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\n        *   If I move DOWN, and Enemy moves RIGHT, I LOSE.\n        *   I am effectively moving into a trap if the enemy is aggressive.\n        *   **BUT**, I have no other move. I am forced to move DOWN.\n        *   I must pray the enemy does not move RIGHT.\n        *   Where else can the enemy go?\n        *   **Enemy Moves from (8,7):**\n            *   UP to (8,8): My body is NOT there? Wait, my body is `[(9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]`.\n            *   Wait, check the board. Row 8 shows `T T T T`.\n            *   My body is at (9,9), (8,9), (7,9).\n            *   Enemy Body is at (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7).\n            *   If Enemy moves UP to (8,8):\n                *   (8,8) is currently occupied by Enemy Body.\n                *   **Wait!** Can a snake move into its own body?\n                *   **Rule:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n                *   So Enemy cannot move UP into (8,8) because it's currently his own body (unless his tail moves away, freeing it).\n                *   Let's look at the tail. Enemy tail is at (5, 7).\n                *   If Enemy moves UP, the tail moves (unless he eats an apple).\n                *   Is there an apple at (8, 8)? The board shows `T` at (8,8). No apple.\n                *   So if Enemy moves UP, his tail leaves (5,7), and his head enters (8,8).\n                *   But (8,8) is currently occupied by his own body.\n                *   **Simultaneous Movement:** The head moves to (8,8) at the same time the tail moves from (5,7).\n                *   **Self-Collision Rule:** Usually, you can move into the space your tail *just* vacated.\n                *   However, the prompt says: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n                *   Is Enemy moving backwards? No, he is at (8,7), moving UP to (8,8).\n                *   His body is at (8,8) -> (7,8)...\n                *   Wait, if he moves UP, his head goes to (8,8).\n                *   His body segment currently at (8,8) will move to (7,8)? No, the body follows the head.\n                *   If he moves UP, his new body will be: Head(8,8), then old Head(8,7), then old Body(8,8)...\n                *   **Wait, (8,8) is currently part of his body.**\n                *   If he moves UP to (8,8), he is moving into a cell occupied by his own body *before* the move.\n                *   **Rule:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n                *   Therefore, Enemy **cannot** move UP. (8,8) is blocked by his own body.\n            *   **Enemy LEFT to (7,7):**\n                *   Is it safe? Enemy body is at (7,8).\n                *   My body is at (7,9).\n                *   (7,7) is empty.\n                *   Is there an apple? Board Row 7: `... . A 0 A`. (7,7) is empty. (7,6) is empty. (7,5) is empty. (7,4) is empty.\n                *   Wait, let's check the board map again.\n                *   Row 7: `7 . . . . . T . A 0 A`\n                *   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n                *   (7,7) is index 7 -> `A` (Apple!).\n                *   Yes!

No (Row 6 is empty).\n            *   **Enemy RIGHT to (9,7):**\n                *   My head is moving there (I'm moving DOWN to 9,7).\n                *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, we collide.\n                *   Collision -> I die (3 apples), Enemy dies (5 apples). **Enemy wins.**\n                *   Enemy would probably prefer this if they want to win immediately.\n                *   **BUT**, looking at the board, (9,7) is an apple.\n                *   I am at (9,8). Enemy at (8,7).\n                *   If I move DOWN, I eat (9,7).\n                *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, he tries to eat (9,7).\n                *   We both go for the same apple. Double KO.\n                *   **However**, I have 3 apples, Enemy has 5. Enemy wins the tie-break.\n                *   **This is bad for me.**\n\n4.  **THE DILEMMA:**\n    *   I *must* move DOWN (only legal move).\n    *   Enemy *can* move RIGHT.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, I lose.\n    *   Is there any other move for me? No. UP is suicide (into my body). LEFT is suicide (into enemy body). RIGHT is wall.\n\n5.  **RE-EVALUATING THE BOARD STATE:**\n    *   Wait, look at my body again: `[(9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]`.\n    *   The board shows `T T T` in row 9.\n    *   Row 8: `... T T T T 1`.\n    *   My head is at (9,8).\n    *   My body is at (9,9), (8,9), (7,9).\n    *   Enemy body is at (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7).\n    *   Enemy Head is at (8,7).\n    *   **Wait, look at row 8.**\n    *   `8 . . . A . T T T T 1`\n    *   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    *   (8,8) is 'T' (Enemy Body).\n    *   (9,8) is '1' (Me).\n    *   **Wait, look at the Apple list.** `(8, 3), (9, 7), (7, 4)...`\n    *   Is there an apple at (9, 8)? No.\n    *   Is there an apple at (9, 7)? Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple at (8, 7)? No, that's the enemy head.\n\n6.  **THE PLAN:**\n    *   I am forced to move **DOWN** to (9, 7).\n    *   Why? Because it's the only move that doesn't kill me instantly.\n    *   If I move DOWN, I eat the apple at (9, 7). My score becomes 4.\n    *   **CRITICAL:** The enemy is at (8, 7).\n    *   Can the enemy move RIGHT to (9, 7)?\n        *   If we collide, we both die.\n        *   Scores: Me 4 (after eating), Enemy 5.\n        *   **I lose.**\n    *   **BUT**, look at the board map provided in the prompt.\n    *   Row 7: `7 . . . . . T . A 0 A`\n    *   (7,7) is an Apple.\n    *   (8,7) is Enemy Head (0).\n    *   (9,7) is Apple (A).\n    *   The enemy is standing next to TWO apples? No, (7,7) is left, (9,7) is right.\n    *   The enemy is at (8,7).\n    *   The enemy wants to eat.\n    *   (7,7) is an apple.\n    *   (9,7) is an apple.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (7,7), they eat an apple. Score becomes 6.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9,7), they collide with me.\n    *   **Why would the enemy collide?**\n        *   They might think I won't move into (9,7).\n        *   But I HAVE to. I have no choice.\n        *   If the enemy knows I have to move DOWN, they know I will be at (9,7).\n        *   Therefore, they know moving RIGHT causes a collision.\n        *   If they move RIGHT, they die (5 apples) vs me (3 apples -> 4 apples).\n        *   **Wait, the rule for Double KO:**\n        *   \"If ALL snakes die... The snake with more apples wins.\"\n        *   If we collide, I die, Enemy dies.\n        *   My final apple count: 3 (current) + 1 (if I eat before dying?) -> **UNCLEAR.**\n        *   Usually, you eat *then* die, or die *then* eat?\n        *   \"Move onto an apple? You GROW... and get +1 point.\"\n        *   \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH snakes die.\"\n        *   **Order of operations:**\n        *   1. Move heads.\n        *   2. Check collisions.\n        *   3. Check apple consumption.\n        *   **Wait, if I move to (9,7) and Enemy moves to (9,7), we collide.**\n        *   Usually, collision happens instantly.\n        *   If I die, do I get the apple?\n        *   In most snake games, if you die on an apple, you don't eat it.\n        *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   If I move to (9,7) and Enemy moves to (9,7), we collide.\n        *   I do not get the point. My score stays 3.\n        *   Enemy score stays 5.\n        *   **Result:** Enemy wins (5 > 3).\n        *   **Therefore, I absolutely cannot let the enemy move RIGHT.**\n\n7.  **PSYCHOLOGY:**\n    *   The enemy has 5 apples. I have 3.\n    *   The enemy is winning.\n    *   The enemy sees me at (9,8).\n    *   The enemy sees I am trapped (only can go DOWN).\n    *   The enemy sees (9,7) is an apple.\n    *   The enemy sees (7,7) is an apple.\n    *   The enemy is at (8,7).\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT, they guarantee a win (Double KO, 5 > 3).\n    *   **This is a huge risk for me.**\n    *   Is there any reason the enemy would NOT move RIGHT?\n        *   Maybe they are greedy and want to eat (7,7) to get to 6 apples.\n        *   Maybe they want to avoid the risk of drawing (though they win the draw).\n        *   But if they move LEFT, they eat (7,7). Score 6.\n        *   Then I eat (9,7). Score 4.\n        *   Then we are separated. I am at (9,7), they are at (7,7).\n        *   I am safer then.\n    *   **However**, if the enemy is smart, they see the instant win condition: move RIGHT, force collision, win on score.\n    *   **BUT**, look at the board again.\n    *   Row 8: `... T T T T 1` (at 9,8).\n    *   Enemy Body at (8,8).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, they leave (8,7).\n    *   My body is at (9,9), (8,9), (7,9).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (9,7), I am safe from my own body.\n    *   I am safe from enemy body (they are moving towards me).\n    *   **The only threat is the head-on collision.**\n\n8.  **THE MOVE:**\n    *   I have NO choice. I MUST move DOWN.\n    *   I cannot go UP (into my body).\n    *   I cannot go LEFT (into enemy body).\n    *   I cannot go RIGHT (wall).\n    *   **I am forced to walk into the line of fire.**\n    *   I will move DOWN to (9, 7).\n    *   I will hope the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 7) to eat the apple there, rather than colliding with me.\n    *   Why would they move left? Because it's a safe apple. Colliding is a draw (for them, they win) but a risky play if I wasn't there? No, I am there.\n    *   Actually, if I am there, moving RIGHT is a guaranteed kill for the enemy (since they win the tie-break).\n    *   **Why wouldn't the enemy take the guaranteed win?**\n    *   Maybe they didn't see the score difference? No, they are playing to win.\n    *   **Is there any other interpretation of the collision rule?**\n    *   \"If ALL snakes die... The snake with more apples wins.\"\n    *   If we collide, we both die.\n    *   If we both die, they win (5 > 3).\n    *   **This looks like a bad situation.**\n    *   **Wait!** Let me check the board coordinates again.\n    *   My Head: (9, 8)\n    *   Enemy Head: (8, 7)\n    *   If I move DOWN to (9, 7).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 7).\n    *   Collision.\n    *   **Is there any wall or obstacle at (9, 7)?**\n    *   Board shows `A` at (9, 7).\n    *   **Is there any way to discourage the enemy?**\n    *   No. I am forced.\n    *   **Is there any move I missed?**\n    *   No.\n    *   **Let's re-read the rules.**\n    *   \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n    *   **WAIT!**\n    *   \"If you crash into him, you lose.\"\n    *   \"If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n    *   **What does this mean in the context of a head-on collision?**\n    *   The prompt clarifies:\n        *   \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision.\"\n        *   \"If ALL snakes die... The snake with more apples wins.\"\n    *   So, \"If he crashes into you\" usually means he enters your body. But if heads collide, both die.\n    *   The specific phrasing \"If he crashes into you, he loses\" is interesting.\n    *   Does it apply to head-on?\n    *   The prompt explicitly overrides this with \"BOTH snakes die\" for head-on.\n    *   So, if we head-on, we both die. Winner is decided by score.\n    *   **I am at a disadvantage (3 vs 5).**\n\n    *   **Can I influence the enemy's decision?**\n    *   No.\n    *   **Is there a play where I don't move DOWN?**\n    *   No.\n    *   **Wait, look at the board state again.**\n    *   `9 . . . . . . .

No, if they move RIGHT, I die, they die, they win.\n        *   It is a **guaranteed win** for the enemy if they move RIGHT.\n        *   **Why would the enemy NOT take a guaranteed win?**\n        *   They might not have calculated the score difference?
