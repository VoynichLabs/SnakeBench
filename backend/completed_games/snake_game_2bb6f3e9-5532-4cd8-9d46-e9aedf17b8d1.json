          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. The user is controlling Snake #1, which is at (5,5) with a body part at (5,6). The apples are at (7,5), (5,0), (5,2), (9,6), and (6,7). The enemy Snake #0 is at (8,5) with a body part at (8,6).\n\nFirst, I need to check all possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The last move was DOWN, which moved the head from (5,5) to (5,6), but wait, the current head is (5,5) and body is (5,6). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the current state says the head is (5,5) and the body is [(5,6)]. That seems odd because normally the body follows the head's previous positions. So the head is at (5,5), and the body is adjacent to it. That makes sense. So the snake's body is one segment behind the head.\n\nNow, the last move was DOWN. So the previous head was at (5,6) and moved down to (5,5)? Wait, because moving down increases the y-coordinate? Wait, no. The coordinate system is (0,0) at bottom left, so increasing y is up. Wait, the problem statement says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" So moving up would decrease y? Wait, no. Wait, in standard grid coordinates, moving up would decrease the y value if the origin is at the bottom. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. If (0,0) is the bottom left, then moving up would increase the y-coordinate. For example, from (5,5) moving up would go to (5,6), and moving down would go to (5,4). Wait, that makes sense. Because (0,0) is bottom left, so higher y is towards the top. So moving up increases y, moving down decreases y. So the last move was DOWN, which would have moved the head from (5,6) to (5,5). Because if the previous head was at (5,6), moving down would decrease y by 1 to (5,5). That makes sense now. So the last move was DOWN, which is moving towards the bottom.\n\nNow, the current head is at (5,5), and the body is (5,6). So the snake's body is directly above the head. That's a bit unusual, but possible. So the snake has two segments: head at (5,5), body at (5,6). \n\nNow, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nFirst, UP: moving up would take the head to (5,6). But the current body is at (5,6). So moving into the own body. That's a collision, which would kill the snake. So UP is invalid.\n\nDOWN: moving down would take the head to (5,4). Need to check if that's safe. The body would then be (5,5), which is the previous head position. So the new body would be the previous head's position. So the new body is [(5,5)], and the head is (5,4). That's safe as long as (5,4) is not occupied by any other snake's body or another snake's head. Let's check the board state. Looking at the board, row 4 is all empty. So (5,4) is empty. So DOWN is a possible safe move.\n\nLEFT: moving left would take the head to (4,5). Check if that's safe. The body would then be (5,5). So the new body is [(5,5)]. The cell (4,5) needs to be checked. Looking at the board, row 5 has (5,5) as the head, but (4,5) is empty. Also, check if any other snake's body is there. The enemy snake is at (8,5) and (8,6). So (4,5) is empty. So LEFT is a possible safe move.\n\nRIGHT: moving right would take the head to (6,5). Check if that's safe. The body would be (5,5). The cell (6,5) needs to be checked. The board at row 6: (6,7) is an apple, but (6,5) is empty. Also, the enemy snake is at (8,5) and (8,6). So (6,5) is empty. So RIGHT is a safe move.\n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is invalid.\n\nNow, among these, which is the best. The objective is to get apples and avoid collisions. The current position is (5,5). The apples are at (7,5), (5,0), (5,2), (9,6), (6,7). Let's see which direction takes the snake closer to an apple.\n\nDOWN: (5,4). From here, maybe towards (5,2) or (5,0). But (5,4) is two steps away from (5,2) and four steps from (5,0). LEFT: (4,5). Not sure. RIGHT: (6,5). The apple at (7,5) is two steps to the right. So moving right would get closer to that apple. Alternatively, the apple at (6,7) is two steps up and one step right. But that's more steps. The apple at (7,5) is directly two steps to the right. So moving right could get closer to that apple.\n\nBut also, need to consider future moves. For example, if moving right to (6,5), then next move could be right to (7,5) to get the apple. But need to check if that's possible. However, the enemy snake is at (8,5), so if the user's snake moves to (7,5), that's not directly conflicting. But the enemy's head is at (8,5). So if the user's snake moves to (7,5), then the enemy's snake could move left to (7,5), causing a collision. But since all snakes move simultaneously, the enemy's head would move. The enemy's current head is (8,5). If the enemy moves left, they would go to (7,5), which would collide with the user's head. But that would kill both. However, the user's move is to choose their direction. So if the user moves right to (6,5), then the enemy could move left to (7,5), but that's a possible collision. However, the user's move is to avoid that. But since the user can't predict the enemy's move, maybe it's better to avoid such positions.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) might be safer. Or down to (5,4). Let's think about the apples. The apple at (5,0) is in the same column. If the snake moves down, it could go towards that apple. But (5,0) is four steps down from (5,5). So moving down once would get to (5,4), then down again to (5,3), etc. But each move is one step. So moving down could be a way to get towards (5,0) or (5,2). The apple at (5,2) is two steps below (5,5). So moving down once would get to (5,4), then another down to (5,3), then (5,2) for the apple. But that's three steps. Alternatively, moving left or right might not be as direct.\n\nBut also, need to consider that after moving, the next move options. For example, if moving right to (6,5), then next move could be right again to (7,5) to get the apple. But if the enemy is at (8,5), their next move could be left to (7,5), which would collide with the user's head. So that's a risk. However, the user can't control the enemy's move. So maybe moving right is risky, but maybe there's a way to avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) might open up more options. Or moving down to (5,4) could be a way to get towards the (5,2) or (5,0) apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving in a direction that allows for more future moves. For example, moving down might avoid being trapped. Let's see. The current body is at (5,6), so if the snake moves down to (5,4), the new body would be (5,5). Then, the next move could be up, left, right, or down. But moving up would take the head to (5,5), which is the previous body. That's allowed, as the body is now (5,5), but the head would be moving into the body. Wait, no. The body is the previous head positions. So after moving down to (5,4), the body becomes [(5,5)]. So the next move's body would be the previous head (5,4). So if the snake moves up from (5,4) to (5,5), that's into the body. So that's invalid. So moving up from (5,4) would be into the body. So that's a problem. So moving down might restrict future moves. Similarly, moving left to (4,5) would have the body at (5,5). Then, moving right back to (5,5) would be into the body. So that's also a problem. So moving left or down could limit future options.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (6,5) would have the body at (5,5). So next move could be right again to (7,5), which is the apple. But as mentioned before, the enemy could be moving left to (7,5), causing a collision. However, the enemy's move is separate. The user can't control it. So if the user moves right to (6,5), and the enemy moves left to (7,5), then both heads would be at (7,5) and (8,5) respectively. Wait, no. The enemy's head is at (8,5). If they move left, they would go to (7,5). So if the user's head is at (6,5) and the enemy's head is at (7,5), that's not a collision. Wait, no. If the user's head is at (6,5) and the enemy's head is at (7,5), that's not a collision. So maybe moving right is safe. But if the enemy moves left to (7,5), and the user's head is at (7,5), then that's a collision. Wait, the user's head would be at (7,5) if they move right from (6,5) to (7,5). So if the enemy's head moves to (7,5) as well, then both heads would be there, causing both to die. But that's a possible scenario. However, the user can't predict the enemy's move. So maybe it's better to avoid such a position.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (6,5) is a direct path towards the apple at (7,5). But if the user can get there safely, that's a good move. However, the risk is that the enemy might move into that spot. But since the enemy's current position is (8,5), they might choose to move in a different direction. For example, maybe the enemy is moving towards their own apples. But without knowing their strategy, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother consideration is that the apple at (6,7) is above. To reach that, the snake would need to move up from (5,5) to (5,6), but that's the current body. So that's not possible. Alternatively, moving up from (5,5) is invalid. So that apple is not reachable now. However, if the snake can move in a way to get to (6,7), but that would require moving right and up. But that's not possible in one move. So maybe that apple is not immediately reachable.\n\nThe apple at (9,6) is further away. So perhaps the immediate target is (7,5) or (5,2) or (5,0). \n\nThe apple at (5,2) is two steps down from the current head. So moving down once would get to (5,4), then down again to (5,3), then (5,2). But each move is one step. So moving down twice would get there. But during that time, the snake has to avoid collisions.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) and then down to (4,4), etc., but that might not be as direct.\n\nSo considering the immediate apples, (7,5) is two steps right. (5,2) is two steps down. (5,0) is four steps down. (9,6) is further. (6,7) is up and right.\n\nSo the closest apple is (5,2) and (7,5). \n\nNow, the move directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nIf the user moves right to (6,5), then next move could be right again to (7,5) to get the apple. But the risk is the enemy moving into (7,5). However, the enemy's current position is (8,5). If they move left, they would go to (7,5). So if the user moves to (6,5) and the enemy moves to (7,5), then the user's next move to (7,5) would collide with the enemy's head. But since all moves happen simultaneously, the user's head would be at (7,5) and the enemy's head at (7,5), causing both to die. That's a high risk. So moving right might be dangerous if the enemy decides to move left. But since the user can't control the enemy's move, maybe it's better to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) is safe, but not towards any apple. Moving down to (5,4) is towards (5,2) and (5,0). \n\nAnother factor is that the user has only one apple, and the enemy also has one. So there's competition. The user needs to maximize their apples.\n\nAnother thing: the previous move was DOWN. So the last move was moving down. The next move should avoid moving in a way that would cause a collision with the own body. For example, if the snake moves down again, the body would be (5,5), and the head at (5,4). Then, moving up again would go to (5,5), which is the body. So that's invalid. So moving down again would trap the snake. So maybe moving down is not a good idea if it leads to a dead end. \n\nWait, the current body is (5,6). If the snake moves down to (5,4), the new body is (5,5). So the next move could be up to (5,5) (which is the body) or down to (5,3). So if the snake moves down again, then the body would be (5,4), and the head at (5,3). Then moving up to (5,4) would be into the body. So moving down multiple times could create a vertical line, which might be restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, moving left or right might offer more flexibility. \n\nAnother point: the user's snake is at (5,5) with body at (5,6). So if they move right, the new head is (6,5), body is (5,5). Then, moving right again would go to (7,5), which is the apple. But again, the enemy might be moving there. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) would not be towards any apple, but might allow for other paths. \n\nSo the options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nThe user needs to choose between these. \n\nThe rationale should consider which move is safest and most beneficial. \n\nIf moving right is risky due to potential collision with the enemy, then maybe it's not the best. \n\nMoving down could be towards the (5,2) apple, but requires two steps. \n\nMoving left is not towards any apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right is the best if the enemy isn't moving left. But since the enemy's move is unpredictable, the user has to assume the worst case. \n\nBut according to the rules, the user must choose a move that doesn't kill them immediately. So as long as the move is safe, it's acceptable. \n\nSo, the safest moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nNow, which of these is best. \n\nIf the user moves right to (6,5), they are closer to (7,5) apple. But if the enemy moves left to (7,5), then the user's next move to (7,5) would collide. However, if the enemy moves in another direction, then the user can get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4) is towards (5,2) apple. \n\nWhich is better? It depends on the risk vs reward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (4,5) is safer in the short term. \n\nBut the user's current position is (5,5). The apple at (5,2) is two steps down. So moving down once would get to (5,4), then another down to (5,3), then (5,2). But each move is one step. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) and then down to (4,4), etc. \n\nBut the user's goal is to collect apples. \n\nAnother thing: the user's snake has only two segments. So the body is one segment. So if they move in a way that doesn't trap themselves. \n\nIf the user moves right to (6,5), then the body is (5,5). Next move, if they go right again to (7,5), that's good. But if they go left, back to (5,5), which is the body. So that's invalid. \n\nBut the user can choose to move in any direction. \n\nSo, considering all this, perhaps moving right is the best option because it's moving towards the (7,5) apple. However, the risk is that the enemy might be moving towards that cell. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4) is safer but requires more steps. \n\nBut maybe the user should prioritize getting the apple at (7,5) if possible. \n\nAlternatively, check if moving right is safe. The cell (6,5) is empty. The enemy's head is at (8,5), and body at (8,6). So (6,5) is not adjacent to the enemy. So moving right is safe. \n\nSo the decision is between DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nThe user's last move was DOWN. Maybe the enemy is in a position where they might move left. But without knowing, it's hard. \n\nThe priority is to collect apples. The closest apple is (5,2) and (7,5). \n\nIf the user moves right, they can reach (7,5) in two moves. If they move down, they can reach (5,2) in two moves. \n\nBut moving right is closer to the apple. \n\nHowever, if the enemy is moving left, then the user's next move to (7,5) could collide. But that's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving down might be safer. \n\nBut since the user's goal is to collect apples, moving towards (7,5) seems better. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the move is safe. \n\nSo, the possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nSo the best choice is to move RIGHT towards the apple at (7,5), but considering the risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to get towards (5,2). \n\nBut which is better? \n\nAnother factor: the snake's body is at (5,6). If the user moves right, the body becomes (5,5). Then, the next move can be right again. \n\nIf the user moves down, the body becomes (5,5), and then moving down again would be (5,4), body (5,5). \n\nBut moving down might not be as beneficial. \n\nAlternatively, moving left to (4,5) is not towards any apple. \n\nSo between DOWN and RIGHT. \n\nIf the user can safely move right, it's better. \n\nBut is there a way to avoid collision? \n\nThe enemy is at (8,5). If they move left, they would go to (7,5). So if the user moves right to (6,5), then the enemy could move left to (7,5), but that's a different cell. Then, the user's next move to (7,5) would be safe unless the enemy is there. \n\nWait, if the user moves right to (6,5), and the enemy moves left to (7,5), then the user's next move to (7,5) would collide with the enemy's head. \n\nBut if the enemy moves in another direction, then the user can get the apple. \n\nSo the risk is that the enemy might move into (7,5), but the user can't know. \n\nIn that case, moving right is a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4) is safer. \n\nBut then, the apple at (5,2) is two steps away. \n\nSo, which move is better? \n\nThe user has to balance between immediate apple collection and safety. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (5,2) is in the same column. If the user moves down, they can get there. \n\nBut the user's current move options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nSo, perhaps moving right is the best because it's moving towards an apple, but with a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving down is safer. \n\nBut the user's snake is in a position where moving right is safe. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy's head is at (8,5). If the user moves right to (6,5), then the enemy might move left to (7,5), but that's not directly conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's head would be at (6,5), and the enemy's head at (7,5). No collision. \n\nThen, the next turn, if the user moves right to (7,5), and the enemy moves left to (7,5), then both heads are at (7,5), causing both to die. \n\nBut that's a possible scenario. \n\nSo, if the user moves right now, they might be setting themselves up for a collision if the enemy moves left. \n\nBut if the enemy doesn't move left, then the user can collect the apple. \n\nSince the user can't predict the enemy's move, it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (5,4) is safer. \n\nBut then, the apple at (5,2) is two steps away. \n\nSo, which is better? \n\nIn terms of safety, moving down or left is safer. \n\nBut in terms of apple collection, moving right is better. \n\nSo the trade-off is between immediate risk and future gain. \n\nSince the user's goal is to collect as many apples as possible, and the game can end when all opponents are dead or after 150 turns, the user should aim to get apples. \n\nBut if moving right leads to a possible collision, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not likely to move left. \n\nBut the enemy's strategy is unknown. \n\nIn the absence of information, perhaps the safest move is to go down. \n\nBut I need to think about the next possible moves. \n\nIf the user moves down to (5,4), then next move could be down again to (5,3), then (5,2) for the apple. \n\nAlternatively, if the user moves right to (6,5), then next move right to (7,5) for the apple. \n\nSo, moving right could get an apple in two moves. \n\nBut the risk is the enemy's move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving left. \n\nBut without knowing, it's hard. \n\nIn this case, perhaps the best approach is to move right, as it's a direct path to an apple, and the risk is manageable. \n\nBut I need to check if moving right is safe. \n\nYes, the cell (6,5) is empty. \n\nSo the answer is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

Now, the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But UP would take the head to (5,6), which is where the body is. That's a collision, so UP is invalid. \n\nSo the valid moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\nDOWN: Moving down from (5,5) would take the head to (5,4). The new body would be (5,5). Need to check if (5,4) is safe. The board shows row 4 is all empty, so that's safe. This could be good because there's an apple at (5,0) and (5,2), which are below. But moving down might take the snake towards those apples.\n\nLEFT: Moving left to (4,5). The body becomes (5,5). Check if (4,5) is safe. The board shows row 5 has (5,5) as head, but (4,5) is empty. Also, enemy snake is at (8,5) and (8,6). So (4,5) is safe. This move doesn't directly get closer to an apple, but might keep options open.\n\nRIGHT: Moving right to (6,5). The body becomes (5,5). (6,5) is empty. The apple at (7,5) is two steps to the right. This seems promising because moving right could lead to the apple in two moves. However, there's a risk if the enemy snake moves left to (7,5). The enemy's head is at (8,5), so if they move left, they'd go to (7,5). If the user moves right to (6,5), then next turn, if the enemy moves left to (7,5), and the user moves right to (7,5), both heads would collide. But that's a risk. However, the enemy's move is unknown. \n\nConsidering the safety and the potential to get the apple at (7,5), moving right seems like the best immediate gain. Even though there's a risk, the apple is closer. Also, moving right now allows for future moves towards (7,5). \n\nSo the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",
