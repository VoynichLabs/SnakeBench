From (8, 8), I can go either UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP.\n\nGoing RIGHT first to (9, 8) seems better because it keeps me away from the center where the enemy snake might move, and I'll be positioned to grab the corner apple on my next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT, move UP to collect the apple at (9, 9), then plan to move toward other apples while avoiding the corner trap.\n\nRIGHT"
