Next closest is (8, 6) (distance 4). Enemy is at (7, 9) with 1 apple.\n2.  **Move Comparison**:\n    *   **RIGHT to (9, 2)**: Sets up a path to (9, 4) in 3 total moves. Distance to (8, 6) becomes 5. Commits to the edge column.\n    *   **UP to (8, 3)**: Sets up a path to (9, 4) in 3 total moves (UP -> RIGHT -> UP). Distance to (8, 6) becomes 3. Keeps me central and flexible.\n3.  **Opponent Analysis**: The opponent is at (7, 9) and equidistant to (8, 6) (distance 4). They will likely move RIGHT to (8, 9) to target it.\n4.  **Decision**: Moving UP is superior because it preserves the fastest route to (9, 4) while simultaneously placing me closer to (8, 6).\n    *   If the opponent moves RIGHT (towards column 8), they are on a collision course for (8, 6) and win ties (more apples). I will then turn RIGHT on the next turn to safely take (9, 4).\n    *   If the opponent moves LEFT (away from column 8), I can continue UP to steal (8, 6), as I will be closer.\n5.  **Safety**: Moving UP to (8, 3) is safe from collision (enemy is at Y=9) and keeps me away from the \"neck\" constraint (previous move was UP, so DOWN is fatal).\n\nPlan: Move UP to (8, 3). If Enemy 0 moves to column 8, switch target to (9, 4) by moving RIGHT next turn. If Enemy 0 moves left, continue UP to take (8, 6).\n\nUP",

Since they win ties, I must concede (8, 6). I will move **RIGHT** on Turn 3 to safely take the apple at (9, 4).\n    *   If Opponent moves **RIGHT** to (9, 9): They have abandoned the direct line to (8, 6).
