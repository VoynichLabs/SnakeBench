LEFT is the neck at (7,0) (backwards), and DOWN is off-board.\n\nGoing RIGHT puts us in the (9,0) corner where the next move is essentially forced. Going UP avoids immediately pinning ourselves into the corner this turn and keeps the position marginally more flexible if the right side changes (even though our nearby body still heavily restricts turns).\n\nStrategy note: we\u2019re in a tight corridor on the bottom-right; prioritize moves that avoid getting hard-pinned on the x=9 edge and look for an exit back toward open space as soon as any adjacent body squares clear.\n\nUP",
