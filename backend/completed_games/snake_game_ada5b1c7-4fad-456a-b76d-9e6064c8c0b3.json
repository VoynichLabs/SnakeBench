Or maybe the position is still at (5,7)? The description states the last move was UP, moving from (5,4), but the initial position was at (5,7). There might be some confusion.\n\nBut per the last statement, the snake is at (5,7), and last move was UP.\n\nWait, the last move info shows the snake was at (5,4), but the current position is at (5,7). That suggests I need to double-check the position.\n\nGiven the \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (5,7)\", I will assume the current position is at (5,7). Moving UP from (5,7) to (5,8) would be consistent.\n\nAlso, the last move is UP, so moving from (5,7) to (5,8). But the \"Direction: UP\" is linked with the move, so the last move was UP from (5,7) to (5,8).\n\nNow, considering the prompt's information:\n\n- Our snake at (5,7), just moved UP to (5,8). So current position is at (5,8).\n- The next goal is to approach apples conveniently.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- Apples at (6,5), (1,5), (3,6), (1,9), (2,8)\n\nCompared to our current position at (5,8):\n\n- (6,5): Down and to the right. Maybe reachable but not immediate.\n- (1,9): Up and left, more distant.\n- (2,8): Left and slightly up/down? Actually, (2,8) is to the left; since y=8, same as us, but x=2.\n\nOur current position:\n\n(5,8)\n\nApple at (2,8):\n\n- Difference: x: 5 - 2 = 3 right, y: same (8). So, to reach (2,8), drive left.\n\nSimilarly, apple at (6,5):\n\n- x difference: 6 - 5 = 1 right\n- y difference: 8 - 5 = 3 up, but apple is at y=5, so move down.\n\nSo, the closest apple seems to be at (6,5)\u2014to reach it, move right, then down.\n\nApple at (2,8) is about 3 moves left, so moving towards (2,8) seems feasible, but might take some time.\n\nIn terms of safety:\n\n- The space to the immediate left of (5,8) at (4,8) seems open.\n- Moving left is safe unless there's an obstacle. Checking the board:\n\nPosition (4,8) is at (4,8), is there a snake there? The enemy snake at (4,8)? The enemy snake's position at (3,8) with body at (4,8), so (4,8) is occupied by an enemy segment.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,8) would result in collision with enemy body segment, which is deadly.\n\nMoving DOWN:\n\n- Currently at (5,8), moving DOWN to (5,7), back to previous position\u2014probably OK unless obstacle.\n\nMoving RIGHT:\n\n- To (6,8): board shows nothing immediately blocking it, but at (6,8), there is an apple at (6,5), not at (6,8), so moving right is safe.\n\nMoving UP:\n\n- To (5,9): at the top row, (5,9). Moving UP to (5,9) is still safe; no obstacle there.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best immediate move is to go RIGHT to (6,8).\n\nNext turn, I could plan to reach the apple at (6,5) by moving down a few steps.\n\nSo, my approach:\n\n- From (5,8), moving RIGHT to (6,8) is safe and brings me closer to the apple at (6,5) along the y-axis.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7) is safe unless that move contradicts the current position.\n\nGiven the above, and considering the enemy body at (4,8), moving RIGHT seems the best.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be **RIGHT**.\n\nNext plan:\n\n- Head towards (6,5): move RIGHT then DOWN, then DOWN again to reach the apple.\n\nIn brief:\n\n- Next move: **RIGHT**"
