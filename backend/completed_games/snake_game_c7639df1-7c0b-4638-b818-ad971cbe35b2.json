UP: Moving to (6, 5)\n   - Safe: Not off board, not into my body, not into enemy body, not backwards\n   - Gets me closer to apples at (7, 6) and (5, 8)\n   - Opens up more options in the upper part of the board\n\n2. DOWN: Moving to (6, 3)\n   - NOT SAFE: This would move into my own body segment at (6, 3)\n\n3. LEFT: Moving to (5, 4)\n   - Safe: Not off board, not into my body, not into enemy body, not backwards\n   - Gets me closer to apples at (3, 5) and (5, 8)\n\n4.

Moving UP to (6, 5) keeps me in the same column as the enemy but one space below, which might be safer than moving directly toward it. The enemy could potentially move down to (6, 5) causing a collision, but they might move in other directions too.\n\nI think UP is the best choice as it:\n1. Moves me toward multiple apples\n2. Keeps me in a position with good future options\n3. Avoids direct confrontation with the enemy snake\n\nI'll move UP.<|end_of_box|>\nUP",
