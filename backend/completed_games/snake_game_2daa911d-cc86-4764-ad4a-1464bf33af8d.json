Its head isn\u2019t directly in conflict but is at a strategic position to possibly reach apples or flank Snake #1.\n- Key apples are at (3,4), (1,3), (7,6), (2,8), and (6,1). The current head position (6,3) is slightly diagonally right of (6,1) and a short move needed to reach (3,4) or (2,8).\n- Snake #1's head is at (5,4)\u2014this is adjacent to the apple at (3,4) but not directly grazing it.\n\n**Considerations:**\n1. Move toward available apples: The closest apples under (6,3) are (2,8), (7,6), (3,4) (slightly northeast), and possibly (6,1) (south).\n2. Avoid conflicts: Snake #1\u2019s head at (5,4) is close to the apple at (3,4), but since it's not grazing, moving toward (6,3) should check nearby spaces.\n3. Space awareness: (7,6) and (2,8) are further away and more risky/uncertain due to other potential obstacles.\n4. Snake #1 might try to flank; if unfamiliar with the board, we prioritize safe apple or score-chasing path.\n\nLooking at movement directions:  \n- N/A directly adjacent to major apple clusters.  \n\n**Next Strategy:**  \nMove LEFT (from (6,3) to (5,3)) allows better inspection and maneuvering toward lower apples (like (2,8), (7,6) are to the northeast and (1,3) is northwest). Alternatively, RIGHT (to (7,3)) avoids Snake #1 while leading toward higher-risk areas.

Its body coordinates and growth aren\u2019t listed, but since it hasn't eaten any apples yet, I assume no growth unless it turns onto an apple this move.\n- The snake at position (3, 4), identified as Snake #1, is monitoring the board from its current position. Its head isn\u2019t directly in conflict but is at a strategic position to possibly reach apples or flank Snake #1.\n- Key apples are at (3,4), (1,3), (7,6), (2,8), and (6,1). The current head position (6,3) is slightly diagonally right of (6,1) and a short move needed to reach (3,4) or (2,8).\n- Snake #1's head is at (5,4)\u2014this is adjacent to the apple at (3,4) but not directly grazing it.\n\n**Considerations:**\n1. Move toward available apples: The closest apples under (6,3) are (2,8), (7,6), (3,4) (slightly northeast), and possibly (6,1) (south).\n2. Avoid conflicts: Snake #1\u2019s head at (5,4) is close to the apple at (3,4), but since it's not grazing, moving toward (6,3) should check nearby spaces.\n3. Space awareness: (7,6) and (2,8) are further away and more risky/uncertain due to other potential obstacles.\n4. Snake #1 might try to flank; if unfamiliar with the board, we prioritize safe apple or score-chasing path.\n\nLooking at movement directions:  \n- N/A directly adjacent to major apple clusters.  \n\n**Next Strategy:**  \nMove LEFT (from (6,3) to (5,3)) allows better inspection and maneuvering toward lower apples (like (2,8), (7,6) are to the northeast and (1,3) is northwest). Alternatively, RIGHT (to (7,3)) avoids Snake #1 while leading toward higher-risk areas.

The best path is to:  \n- Stay close to (6,3) for immediate surveillance,  \n- Use the leftward drift to probe peripherally and avoid hit-and-run risks,  \n- Scan toward (2,8) and (7,6) cautiously, but none require a direct dive unless needed for apple access.  \n\nLeaving room to maneuver rightward if a better opportunity arises, but first, I want to test leftward direction to keep pace avoidant.  \n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nExplore LEFT briefly to confirm neighbor balance, planning a possible lateral shift towards (4,3) or (5,2).  \n\n**Decided Move:** LEFT",

Its body coordinates and growth aren\u2019t listed, but since it hasn't eaten any apples yet, I assume no growth unless it turns onto an apple this move.\n- The snake at position (3, 4), identified as Snake #1, is monitoring the board from its current position. Its head isn\u2019t directly in conflict but is at a strategic position to possibly reach apples or flank Snake #1.\n- Key apples are at (3,4), (1,3), (7,6), (2,8), and (6,1). The current head position (6,3) is slightly diagonally right of (6,1) and a short move needed to reach (3,4) or (2,8).\n- Snake #1's head is at (5,4)\u2014this is adjacent to the apple at (3,4) but not directly grazing it.\n\n**Considerations:**\n1. Move toward available apples: The closest apples under (6,3) are (2,8), (7,6), (3,4) (slightly northeast), and possibly (6,1) (south).\n2. Avoid conflicts: Snake #1\u2019s head at (5,4) is close to the apple at (3,4), but since it's not grazing, moving toward (6,3) should check nearby spaces.\n3. Space awareness: (7,6) and (2,8) are further away and more risky/uncertain due to other potential obstacles.\n4. Snake #1 might try to flank; if unfamiliar with the board, we prioritize safe apple or score-chasing path.\n\nLooking at movement directions:  \n- N/A directly adjacent to major apple clusters.  \n\n**Next Strategy:**  \nMove LEFT (from (6,3) to (5,3)) allows better inspection and maneuvering toward lower apples (like (2,8), (7,6) are to the northeast and (1,3) is northwest). Alternatively, RIGHT (to (7,3)) avoids Snake #1 while leading toward higher-risk areas. Given Snake #1\u2019s proximity, LEFT seems safer for immediate awareness.\n\nNearest applicable space is (5,3)\u2014",

The best path is to:  \n- Stay close to (6,3) for immediate surveillance,  \n- Use the leftward drift to probe peripherally and avoid hit-and-run risks,  \n- Scan toward (2,8) and (7,6) cautiously, but none require a direct dive unless needed for apple access.  \n\nLeaving room to maneuver rightward if a better opportunity arises, but first, I want to test leftward direction to keep pace avoidant.  \n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nExplore LEFT briefly to confirm neighbor balance, planning a possible lateral shift towards (4,3) or (5,2).  \n\n**Decided Move:** LEFT",
