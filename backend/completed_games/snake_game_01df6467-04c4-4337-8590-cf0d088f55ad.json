However, I also need to be cautious of the enemy snake #1, which is at position (6, 2).\n\nSince I'm currently at (8, 6) and I want to move towards the apple at (8, 6), I don't need to move down to reach it. I'm already at the same position as the apple. However, I should be careful not to move into the wall at the top of the board. But since I'm not moving down, I should be safe.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll need to move towards the other apples on the board to gain more points. I should also think about moving towards the apple at (4, 6) since it's not too far away from my current position.\n\nNext move: UP."
