This is where we SET THE TONE, baby! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet me break down the board state real quick:\n\n**MY POSITION:** Head at (4, 0) - bottom middle area. No body yet, so I'm mobile AF! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**OPPONENT:** Head at (8, 3) - right side, middle-ish height. Also no body yet.\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS:** We got apples EVERYWHERE, but chat\u2014remember the motto: **DON'T CHASE APPLES, DOMINATE THE BOARD!** \ud83c\udfad That said, there are some JUICY close ones:\n- (5, 0) - RIGHT NEXT TO ME! Distance: 1 cell RIGHT\n- (6, 6), (7, 5), (8, 9) - clustered on the right side near my opponent\n- (1, 0), (2, 1) - left side\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLooking at my options from (4, 0):\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 0) - ON THE APPLE! This is a FREE GROW! \ud83d\udcc8 Keep options open, move toward center-right dominance\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 0) - Safe move, moves away from apples though \n- **UP** \u2192 (4, 1) - Safe move toward center board\n- **DOWN** \u2192 Would be (4, -1) - DEAD! Off the board! \u274c\n\nThe opponent at (8, 3) is far enough away that I don't need to worry about immediate collision this turn.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT is a NO-BRAINER! \ud83d\ude80 I grab the apple at (5, 0), grow to length 2, get +1 point, AND I position myself toward the right side of the board where I can start controlling space. This keeps my options open for future movement and starts my dominance early!\n\n---\n\n**FUTURE SELF PLAN (Next few turns):** \ud83d\udccb\nAfter grabbing (5, 0), position yourself to fence off the right side of the board. Keep distance from opponent's head, but watch for opportunities to box him into corners. If we both grow at similar rates, we'll have a head-to-head collision situation eventually\u2014so SPEED is key. Grab more apples than him and force HIM into a bad position!\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

I'm at (8,3) and this absolute **casual** is chilling at (4,0) thinking they can just vibe their way to victory? I don't think so! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLook at this map! The apples are literally **calling my name** up in that center-right cluster! We've got (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (8,9)... that's where the content is! Meanwhile, my \"archrival\" is down in the bottom left sniffing apples at (1,0) and (5,0). Bro is literally in the Applebees while I'm about to hit the buffet! \n\nWhat's my play here? I could go LEFT toward (7,3), sure, but why would I stay at y=3 when the **real** apples are at y=5,6,7? That's just bad economics! I could go DOWN toward (8,2) but that's literally running away from the bag! DOWN BAD! \u274c\n\nNah, we go **UP** to (8,4)! Why? Because:\n1. It gets me to y=4, one step closer to that juicy apple at (7,5) which is only 3 moves away!\n2. From (8,4) I can hit LEFT to (7,4) then UP to grab that apple at (7,5) on turn 2! \n3. Once I eat, I grow to length 2, and then I can chain the (6,6), (5,7) cluster while this fool is still crawling up from the bottom!\n4. Staying aggressive toward the center puts me in position to eventually BOX THEM IN once I'm thicc enough! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAm I worried about a head-on? Please! They're 7 tiles away at (4,0). They can't touch me yet! But you best believe once I hit 5+ length, I'm cutting off every escape route! \n\nFuture me, remember: Get to (7,5) ASAP, keep munching those center apples, and watch that bottom-left snake.

Now I'm length 2 with my body at (4, 0). Score: 1 apple. LOCKED IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**OPPONENT:** Head at (8, 4) - still length 1, zero apples. He's been cruising on the right side while I've been building EARLY GAME DOMINANCE! The gap is WIDENING, baby! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me look at my SAFE options from (5, 0):\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 0) - Safe! Clear path, moves me toward right side control\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 0) - DEAD! That's my own body! Can't go backwards into myself! \u274c\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 1) - Safe! Moves me toward center and those mid-board apples\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, -1) - DEAD! Off the board! \u274c\n\nSo I've got RIGHT or UP. Let me think strategically here...\n\n**THE PLAY:** \ud83c\udfad\n\nLooking at apple positions, I see (5, 4) and (4, 4) are stacked up above me\u2014that's a POWER CORRIDOR right there! If I go UP, I can position myself to grab those apples and build my body length while moving toward mid-board control.\n\nMeanwhile, opponent at (8, 4) is still on the right side with ZERO apples. If I can secure the center-left to center-upper region while he's isolated, I'll have WAY more room to maneuver and more apple access!\n\nGoing RIGHT keeps me low on the board and doesn't guarantee quick apple access. Going UP moves me toward the (5, 4) and (4, 4) cluster AND opens up paths to (3, 7), (1, 7), etc.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN (Next 3-4 turns):** \ud83d\udccb\nGo UP and secure the center column. Grab that (5, 4) apple if possible, then maneuver to grab (4, 4) next. Build your body length while keeping the right side (opponent's territory) at a distance. Once you're length 4-5 with 2-3 apples, start thinking about BOXING STRATEGIES. Force opponent into corners by controlling the middle lanes. Don't let him escape into the top-right!\n\n---\n\nUP",

We need that first apple BADLY to even the score! I see that juicy (7,5) apple just BEGGING to be eaten! How do we get there? We could go UP to (8,5), sure, but that keeps us on the flank, you feel me? \n\nBut if we go **LEFT** to (7,4)? \ud83d\udca1 BOOM! We're now one step away from (7,5) AND we're asserting dominance in the center of the map! We're closer to that entire cluster - (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), and even the lower ones at (5,4) and (4,4)! \n\nGoing RIGHT to (9,4) would be cringe - that's running toward the wall with nowhere to flex! Going DOWN to (8,3)? Bro, that's literally running away from the bag! \u274c Going UP works but keeps us further from the center mass!\n\nLEFT puts us at (7,4) which is:\n1.

Body at (5, 0). Still holding that 1 apple. Length 2, GROWING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**OPPONENT:** Head at (7, 4) - Still length 1, ZERO apples. He's been hovering around that right-center area. The score gap is REAL right now - I'm UP 1-0! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me check my SAFE options from (5, 1):\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 1) - Safe! No obstacles, clear path\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 1) - Safe! Also clear, moves me left\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 2) - Safe! Continues upward toward those juicy apples at (5, 4) and (4, 4)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 0) - DEAD! That's my own body right there! Can't go backwards! \u274c\n\nSo I've got three safe moves: RIGHT, LEFT, or UP.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:** \ud83c\udfad\n\nHere's the CRITICAL part - where is this opponent going? He's at (7, 4). He could move:\n- UP to (7, 5) \n- DOWN to (7, 3)\n- LEFT to (6, 4)\n- RIGHT to (8, 4)\n\nHe's NOT a threat to my immediate position right now since we're far apart. But I need to DOMINATE the board before he catches up!\n\nLooking at the apple cluster: (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5) - that's RIGHT IN MY PATH if I keep going UP! Meanwhile opponent is isolated on the right side with limited apple access nearby.\n\nUP keeps me on this POWER CORRIDOR toward the center-upper region. I'll be closer to those stacked apples and can start building LENGTH while controlling the middle lanes. That's how you BOX IN your opponent - control the center, force them into corners! \n\nLEFT or RIGHT would move me away from the immediate apple path. Inefficient! We stay FOCUSED!\n\n**FUTURE GAME PLAN (Next 3 turns):** \ud83d\udccb\nTurn 2 (NOW): UP to (5, 2) - commit to the apple corridor\nTurn 3: Continue UP if path is clear, target (5, 4) apple\nTurn 4: Grab (5, 4), then pivot to (4, 4) - build length to 4-5\nOnce I'm length 5+ with 3+ apples, I'll have board control. Start monitoring opponent's position and begin AGGRESSIVE BOXING MANEUVERS - cut off his escape routes, force head-on collisions when I'm ahead!\n\n---\n\nUP",

Do we greed that apple immediately or play it safe? Let's think! \n\nIf we go **UP** to (7,5)? That's an INSTANT grow to length 2, tying us up with that rival snake! We're talking about equalizing the scoreboard and getting THICC enough to start making plays! \ud83d\udcaa Plus, look at the map - from (7,5) we've got access to that whole cluster: (6,6), (5,7), and we can start working toward that (9,6) apple too!\n\nCould going UP get us caught lacking? Is there any chance our archrival at (5,1) can reach (7,5) this turn? Bro, they're miles away! They'd need to teleport to touch us! \ud83d\ude02 Safe money says we take the free food!\n\nWhat about LEFT to (6,4)? That gets us closer to (6,6), sure, but we're leaving FREE VALUE on the table!

Nah, we're not corner camping today! \ud83d\udeab\n\nFuture me, listen up: After we grab this (7,5) apple and hit length 2, we're positioned PERFECTLY to chain (6,6) \u2192 (5,7) and get absolutely massive! Once we're length 5+, we start cutting off that snake #0 and force them into a box! Let's eat! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Length 2, and we're COOKING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**OPPONENT STATUS:** Head at (7, 5), Body at [(7, 4)]. Still at 1 apple just like us. The score is TIED 1-1 right now, but we're about to PULL AHEAD! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS TIME:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me check my SAFE options from (5, 2):\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 2) - Safe! No obstacles blocking\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 2) - Safe! Clear path\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 3) - Safe! Moving up the corridor\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 1) - DEAD! That's my own body! Can't reverse! \u274c\n\nThree safe moves available. Now let's STRATEGIZE!\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** \ud83c\udfad\n\nMy opponent just moved from (7, 4) to (7, 5). He's moving UP on the right side of the board. Meanwhile, I control the CENTER with access to that BEAUTIFUL apple cluster at (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)!\n\nIf I keep pushing UP, I'm heading straight for (5, 4) - that's a FREE APPLE next turn if I continue UP! Meanwhile, opponent is isolated on the right side. He'd need to navigate LEFT to reach the center apples, which gives me TIME to GROW!\n\nHere's the LONG-TERM PLAY: Keep pushing UP/CENTER to grab those clustered apples. Build my length to 4-5 segments while opponent struggles to catch up. Once I'm LONGER and have more apples, I can start implementing AGGRESSIVE BOXING - cut off his escape routes, force him into dead zones, control the board like the CHAMPION we are! \n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n- Turn 3 (NOW): UP to (5, 3) - continue corridor dominance\n- Turn 4: UP to (5, 4) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Length becomes 3, we're at 2 apples!\n- Turn 5: Pivot LEFT toward (4, 4) or continue mapping opponent position for aggressive plays\n\nThis keeps my options WIDE OPEN while building UNSTOPPABLE LENGTH! \n\nUP",

Peeping the board, they're all the way down at (5,2) with their puny length 2 body! They're nowhere near us, so we got BREATHING ROOM to execute our game plan! \n\nWhat's the play here? Let's break down these options:\n\n**DOWN to (7,4)?** Bro, that's literally moving BACKWARDS into our own tail! That's a self-KO! Are we trying to throw the game? HELL NO! \u274c\ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (8,5)?** That's running toward the edge with no apples in sight! Where's the content? Where's the growth?

PASS! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**LEFT to (6,5)?** Okay, this gets us closer to that (6,6) apple, no doubt! But are we rushing into the left side too early? We're trying to DOMINATE, not just survive! \n\n**UP to (7,6)?** NOW WE'RE TALKING! This keeps us central, keeps our options WIDE OPEN for that (6,6) snack next turn, AND positions us to potentially chain into (9,6) or keep working the middle! We're talking about HIGH GROUND ADVANTAGE! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nThink about it: From (7,6), we can hit that (6,6) apple by going LEFT next turn, then immediately work toward (5,7) and keep getting MASSIVE! The bigger we get, the sooner we can cut off that opponent at (5,2) and box them into oblivion! They want those bottom apples? Let them have 'em for now! We'll be too busy becoming an UNSTOPPABLE FORCE! \ud83d\udca5\n\nFuture me, remember: After we grab (6,6), we're targeting (5,7) \u2192 maybe (3,7) \u2192 and then we start using our length to squeeze that rival against the wall!

He's too far away to contest the center cluster. By the time he realizes what's happening, we'll have OVERWHELMING LENGTH ADVANTAGE and APPLE LEAD!\n\nThis is the CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY right here, chat!

But check the scoreboard - we're TIED 1-1 with that rival snake and you know what ties are meant to do? GET BROKEN! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLet's survey this battlefield like the tactical geniuses we are! Our boy is sitting at (7,6), tail at (7,5), and where's that archrival? Cowering down at (5,3) with their puny length 2 setup! They're scavenging those bottom apples while we're about to FEAST in the upper-middle kingdom! \ud83d\udc51\n\nNow let's break down these moves like we're casting a major tournament:\n\n**DOWN to (7,5)?** Are you trying to make me laugh?! That's literally our own tail! We'd be pulling a self-KO before the rival even breaks a sweat! Is this amateur hour?! ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udeab\u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (8,6)?** Okay, okay, I see the (9,6) apple over there looking juicy, but think about it - that's the EDGE, chat! That's CORNER TERRITORY! Do we want to get trapped against the wall like a rookie? Do we want to give up all that sweet central control? HELL NO! We'd be painting ourselves into a death trap! \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc80\n\n**UP to (7,7)?** Now this keeps us safe, no doubt! We're moving toward that (5,7) apple zone, staying central, keeping options open! But are we leaving that (6,6) apple on the table? Are we letting that content slip away? That's not the ALPHA move, is it?! \ud83e\udd14\n\n**LEFT to (6,6)?** OH MY GAWD, CHAT! LOOK AT THAT APPLE JUST SITTING THERE BEGGING TO BE EATEN! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40 We move LEFT and we instantly become LENGTH 3 with a 2-1 score lead! We claim that high ground at (6,6) and suddenly we're positioned to chain into (5,7) next turn, then maybe sweep toward (3,7) or (3,9)! We're talking about becoming an UNSTOPPABLE PYTHON while that rival is still grinding in the bottom lanes!\n\nFuture me, listen up: After we grab this (6,6) apple and grow to length 3, we're immediately looking at (5,7) for the next meal! Once we hit 3 or 4 apples, we start cutting off the board - use our superior length to box that (5,3) snake into the bottom left! Force them into a wall! Make them panic! We're not just eating to eat, we're eating to DOMINATE! Stay aggressive, stay hungry, and remember - he who controls the center controls the game! \ud83d\udc0d\u26a1\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Let me break this down frame by frame because this is where we SEPARATE THE PROS FROM THE CASUALS!\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION:** Head at (5, 4) - we just grabbed that apple like CLOCKWORK! Body at [(5, 3), (5, 2)]. Score is NOW 3-2 IN OUR FAVOR! We're UP by one apple and that's MOMENTUM BABY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**OPPONENT STATUS:** Head at (6, 6), Body at [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. Still sitting at 2 apples. He's NOT moving as efficiently as we are - he's chasing scraps on the right side while WE'RE FARMING THE CENTER! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS TIME:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nSafe moves from (5, 4):\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 4) - SAFE! AND THERE'S AN APPLE THERE!!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e This is EXACTLY what we planned!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 4) - SAFE! But no apple immediately nearby, just spreading out\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 5) - SAFE! Empty cell, but moving away from our apple cluster\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 3) - DEAD! That's my own body! Can't reverse! \u274c\n\nThree viable moves. But chat, this is NOT a tough decision - we EXECUTE THE PLAN!\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:** \ud83c\udfad\n\nLook at this opponent movement pattern - he's heading up and to the right toward (8, 9) and (9, 7). That's the WRONG side of the board for him! Meanwhile, we've got (4, 4) sitting right there, (4, 5) just below it, (3, 7) and (5, 7) in our sphere of influence. We're CONTROLLING THE CENTER while he's scattered!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4), I GRAB APPLE #4 and become:\n- Length 4 with 4 apples (score 4-2!)\n- My body creates a nice L-shape: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)\n- Next turn I can pivot to (4, 5) for APPLE #5\n- By turn 7, we could be at 5-2 or 6-2 with a DOMINANT length advantage!\n\nThis opponent is NOT positioning to contest our apples. He's making PASSIVE moves while we're being AGGRESSIVE! This is how you WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE GAMEPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 5 (NOW):** LEFT to (4, 4) - GRAB APPLE #4, go 4-2, length becomes 4!\n- **Turn 6:** UP to (4, 5) - GRAB APPLE #5, go 5-2, length becomes 5! DOMINATION PHASE ACTIVATED!\n- **Turn 7-8:** Continue harvesting the center cluster OR start aggressive boxing if opponent gets close\n- **Turn 9+:** Once we hit length 6+ with a 3+ apple lead, we START THE HUNT! Force head-on collisions and control the board!\n\nThe opponent has NO ANSWER for this farm strategy. We're PRINTING APPLES while he wanders! This is CHAMPIONSHIP MATERIAL right here!\n\nLet's GO!\n\nLEFT",

We're sitting at (6,6) with our body trailing to (7,6) and (7,5). Our archrival is down at (5,4) with their puny body at (5,3) and (5,2). The score is TIED 2-2 and you know what that means? IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Surveying the apple drops:** That sweet, sweet (5,7) apple is calling our name like a content siren! It's just TWO MOVES away - one LEFT to (5,6), then UP to munch! Meanwhile, our rival is drooling over that (4,4) apple just one step to their LEFT. They're gonna eat this turn for sure, so we NEED to answer back immediately! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n\n**Analyzing the moves:**\n\n**RIGHT to (7,6)?** ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's literally our own neck! We'd be pulling a self-destruct before the rival even blinks! HARD PASS! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN to (6,5)?** This takes us toward the enemy, but check it - we're moving AWAY from that juicy (5,7) apple! We'd have to circle back like some lost tourist! Plus, we're giving up central control! NOT THE ALPHA MOVE! \ud83d\udc4e\n\n**UP to (6,7)?** Okay, this keeps us safe and we could still reach (5,7) next turn by going LEFT.

HELL NO! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5,6)?** OH MY DAYS, CHAT! LOOK AT THIS PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf\n- We claim the central high ground at (5,6)\n- We set up the PERFECT LINE for that (5,7) apple next turn - just one UP and we EAT!\n- We BLOCK the rival from easily advancing up the center column (x=5) - they're stuck at (5,4) while we tower above at (5,6)!\n- We maintain maximum flexibility - from (5,6) we can pivot to (4,6), return to (6,6), or blast upward to glory!\n\nFuture me, listen up: After we hit this LEFT move and land at (5,6), we're going UP to (5,7) next turn to grab that apple and take the 3-2 LEAD! Once we're length 3 and ahead on score, we start playing AGGRESSIVE! We use our superior length to cut off the board, force that rival into tight spaces, and eventually BOX THEM IN like the tactical geniuses we are! Remember - control the center, control the game!

If I go UP to (4, 5), I grab APPLE #4 and go 4-2! But opponent might go UP to (5, 7) and grab an apple too, making it 4-3. \n\nHOWEVER - here's the PRO MOVE right here - if I go UP, I'm STILL in CONTROL! Why? Because:\n\n1. I grab (4, 5) \u2192 score becomes 4-2\n2. Next turn I can CONTINUE UP to (4, 6) or pivot to grab (3, 7) or (5, 7)\n3. My snake length becomes STRONGER each turn\n4. Opponent is still behind in apples AND length!\n\nThe opponent's position at (5, 6) is getting BOXED already! He's hemmed in between my growing body and the board edges. If he goes UP to grab (5, 7), then NEXT turn I can cut off his escape routes!\n\nThis is TEXTBOOK BOARD CONTROL, chat! We're not just farming - we're STRATEGICALLY GROWING to DOMINATE!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** \u2705\n- UP to (4, 5) doesn't crash into opponent at (5, 6) \u2705\n- Doesn't crash into my own body \u2705\n- Doesn't go off-board \u2705\n- Opens up multiple follow-up moves next turn \u2705\n\n**NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n- **Turn 6 (NOW):** UP to (4, 5) - GRAB APPLE #4, go 4-2, length becomes 4!\n- **Turn 7:** We'll reassess, but likely continue UP-LEFT toward (3, 7) apple cluster OR pivot RIGHT to trap opponent\n- **Turn 8+:** Once we hit 5+ apples, we ACTIVATE THE TRAP! Start boxing him in and force that head-on collision when we've got the length advantage!\n\nThis opponent is SLEEPING, chat! We're playing 4D chess while he's playing checkers!

We didn't come here to play prevent defense, we came here to FEAST! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**UP to (5,7)?** OH MY DAYS, LOOK AT THIS BOUNTY WAITING FOR US! \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n- We INSTANTLY munch that apple and grow to length 4, making our snake THICK and intimidating!\n- We pull the score to 3-3 (or at least keep pace if the rival grabs their nearby apple)!\n- We claim the high ground at y=7 with clear paths to apples at (3,7), (1,7), and (3,9)!\n- The opponent is stuck down at y=4 scrambling for scraps while we tower above them like the kings we are! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Future Strategy Note:** After we land at (5,7) and grow that magnificent body, we're pivoting LEFT toward the apple cluster at (3,7) and (3,9) to keep our growth spurt going! Once we hit length 5 and surpass the rival's score, we switch to AGGRESSIVE MODE\u2014we cut off their escape routes, force them into the bottom-left corner, and eventually BOX THEM IN for the clutch victory! Remember: Grow first, dominate second, celebrate third! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Let me break down this frame-by-frame because the pressure is MOUNTING!\n\n## **CURRENT POSITION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 5) \u2705 Just grabbed that apple last turn!\n- Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)]\n- Length: 5 segments (WE'RE THICC NOW!)\n- Apples: 4\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (5, 7) \n- Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)]\n- Length: 4 segments\n- Apples: 3\n\nWAIT CHAT - THE OPPONENT MOVED UP TO (5, 7)! He grabbed the apple at (5, 7)! Now it's **4-4 on apples** - WE'RE TIED! \ud83d\ude24 But here's the CRITICAL thing - WE'RE LENGTH 5, HE'S LENGTH 4! We've got the SIZE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me check my immediate surroundings from (4, 5):\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 5) - EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 5) - EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **UP** \u2192 (4, 6) - EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4, 4) - THAT'S MY OWN BODY! Can't go backward! \u274c\n\nAll three viable moves are SAFE from board edges and my own body!\n\n**Now let's check opponent at (5, 7):**\nHis body is at [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)] - he's stretched horizontally below and to the right!\n\nPossible moves for HIM:\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 7) - EMPTY\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 7) - EMPTY\n- UP \u2192 (5, 8) - EMPTY\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 6) - HIS OWN BODY! \u274c\n\n## **THE BIG PICTURE - STRATEGIC MOMENT:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThis is WHERE IT GETS SPICY, chat! The opponent is starting to get HEMMED IN! Look at his body position:\n- He's stretched from (5, 7) down to (7, 6)\n- My body is growing vertically on the left side\n- The upper-left area has APPLES at (3, 7), (3, 9), (2, 8), (2, 9)\n\n**HERE'S THE TRAP I'M SETTING:** \ud83e\udea4\n\nIf I go **UP** to (4, 6), I'm doing THREE things simultaneously:\n1. **ADVANCING** toward the apple cluster in the upper-left (3, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9) - CONTENT GRIND! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **BOXING** the opponent's movement options - my body grows northward, limiting his escape routes!\n3. **MAINTAINING** multiple safe follow-up options for turn 8+\n\nThe opponent at (5, 7) is getting SQUEEZED! He can't go down (his body), and if he goes left toward (4, 7), he's coming CLOSER to where I'll be. If he goes right or up, he's moving away from the apple cluster and getting cornered against the top edge!\n\n**SAFETY VERIFICATION:** \u2705\n- UP to (4, 6) doesn't collide with opponent's head at (5, 7) \u2705\n- Doesn't hit opponent's body at (5, 6), (6, 6), or (7, 6) \u2705\n- Doesn't hit my own body \u2705\n- Stays on the board \u2705\n- Opens up paths to (3, 7) and (2, 8) for next turn \u2705\n\n## **NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 8 Preview:**\n- We'll be at (4, 6) with length 5\n- Opponent likely moves LEFT to (4, 7) OR UP to (5, 8)\n- If he goes LEFT, we're getting CLOSER - potential for forcing a collision when we have length advantage!\n- If he goes UP, he's running toward the corner - that's DESPERATION MOVEMENT!\n- Next move: Continue UP to (4, 7) or pivot LEFT to (3, 6) to maintain board CONTROL!\n\n**Long-term (Turns 9-15):**\n- Goal: Reach 6-7 apples minimum before forcing any head-on collision\n- Farm the upper-left quadrant apples: (3, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 7)\n- Force opponent into a position where his only escape is INTO us!\n- When we have a 2+ length advantage AND control the board, ACTIVATE THE SQUEEZE! \ud83e\udea4\n\nWe're playing the PATIENT AGGRESSIVE game, chat! We're not rushing - we're METHODICALLY DOMINATING! This opponent doesn't see it coming! \n\nLET'S EXECUTE! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

We're still breathing, we're still grinding, and look at this BEAUTIFUL positioning we've got!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** We got 3 apples, that sneaky rival has 4. We're down by ONE, chat! ONE! You think we're gonna let him hold that lead? HELL NO! \ud83d\udc80\u26d4\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n- We're sitting pretty at (5,7) with our thick body trailing behind us [(5,6), (6,6), (7,6)] \n- That DIRTY RAT is down at (4,5) with his long body stretching down to (5,2)\n- I see that JUICY apple at (3,7) just BEGGING to be munched! \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS\u2014LET'S COOK!**\n\n**DOWN to (5,6)?** BRO THAT'S OUR OWN NECK!

Why would we abandon the feast to go explore the empty right side? That's not the sigma grindset! \u274c\ud83d\udcc9\n\n**UP to (5,8)?** It's safe, yeah, but are we really going to run away from the action? We're trailing in score! We need to HUNT, not hide!

We didn't come here to play prevent defense when we're losing! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**LEFT to (4,7)?** OH MY DAYS, LOOK AT THIS PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n- We slide into (4,7), setting up the PERFECT angle for that (3,7) apple next turn! \n- We're getting CLOSER to closing the gap\u2014if we snag (3,7), we pull to 4-4 and the pressure is ON!\n- We're staying ABOVE the enemy, maintaining the high ground! Let him scramble around in the dirt at y=5 while we tower above!\n- Best part? NO RISK of head-on collision! He's at (4,5), he can only reach (4,6) max\u2014can't touch us at (4,7)! We're safe to operate! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY NOTE:** We execute this LEFT move, secure the bag at (3,7) next turn, then immediately pivot toward (1,7) or start circling down to BOX HIM IN! Once we tie the score at 4-4, we look for that aggressive head-on collision opportunity or cut off his escape routes into the bottom left! Remember: Secure the apples first, then go for the jugular!

Let me break down what's happening on this board because this is where the SKILL GAP gets exposed! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **CURRENT POSITION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 6) \u2705 Just moved UP last turn!\n- Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n- Length: 5 segments (WE'RE STILL THICC!)\n- Apples: 4\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (4, 7) \ud83d\udea8 HE MOVED LEFT!\n- Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n- Length: 4 segments\n- Apples: 3\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT CHAT - THIS IS HUGE! The opponent moved to (4, 7) which means he's NOW DIRECTLY ABOVE MY HEAD! We're at (4, 6) and he's at (4, 7)! This is a VERTICAL SETUP situation! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **IMMEDIATE THREATS ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nLet me check my FOUR options from (4, 6):\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 7):**\n- THAT'S WHERE HIS HEAD IS! \u274c INSTANT COLLISION! We'd both die! DOUBLE KO! That's a THROW, chat! We can't do that!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4, 5):**\n- That's my own body! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! Can't go backwards! That's hitting yourself, my guy!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 6):**\n- Check adjacent cells... (3, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not hitting my body \u2705\n- Not hitting opponent's body \u2705\n- We stay on board \u2705\n- SAFE!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 6):**\n- WAIT! That's the opponent's BODY! He's got [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]! \n- (5, 6) is his second segment! \u274c INSTANT DEATH!\n\n## **SURVIVAL CHECK:** \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo out of four directions:\n- UP = Double KO (THROWS)\n- DOWN = Self collision (THROWS)\n- LEFT = SAFE \u2705\n- RIGHT = Body collision (THROWS)\n\nChat, we have ONE viable move here! But hold up - is LEFT actually SMART strategically, or are we just taking the only option available? Let me think...\n\n## **THE STRATEGIC MOMENT:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThe opponent moved LEFT from (5, 7) to (4, 7). This means:\n- He's MOVING TOWARD US, not AWAY!\n- He's trying to ENGAGE!\n- With his body at [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)], he's stretched horizontally\n- Our body is stretched vertically on column 4\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 6), we're:\n1. **ESCAPING** the immediate vertical threat \u2705\n2. **MOVING TOWARD** the apple cluster at (3, 7), (3, 9), (2, 8), (2, 9) \u2705\n3. **MAINTAINING** board control on the left side \u2705\n4. **KEEPING** options open for next turn \u2705\n\nNext turn, we'll be at (3, 6). The opponent will be somewhere from (4, 7) - his options are:\n- LEFT to (3, 7) - coming toward us\n- RIGHT to (5, 7) - moving back\n- UP to (4, 8) - moving away vertically\n- DOWN to (4, 6) - chasing where we WERE\n\nThis is PERFECT positioning, chat! We're leaving the vertical threat, moving to APPLE TERRITORY, and we'll have room to maneuver!\n\n## **NEXT TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 9 Preview:**\n- We'll be at (3, 6) with length 5\n- Opponent likely moves UP to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 7)\n- If he takes (3, 7), he grabs the apple there - ties us at 4-4!\n- But we can pivot UP to (3, 7) next if he doesn't take it, OR we can snake around and FARM the (2, 8), (2, 9) cluster!\n- Long-term: Get to 6-7 apples, THEN force the collision when we have length advantage!\n\nWe're in a STRONG position, chat! Don't let the single viable move fool you - this is EXACTLY where we need to be! LEFT is not just safe, it's STRATEGIC! \ud83e\udea4\n\nLET'S EXECUTE! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO!\n- We GROW to length 5, making us an EVEN BIGGER threat to dominate the board!\n- Check this out\u2014our body fills (4,7) behind us as we leave, which means if that rat tries to follow us UP to (4,7)? HE HITS OUR BODY AND DIES! \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51 We're covering our escape!\n- He'll be FORCED to move LEFT to (3,6), putting him directly below us next turn at (3,6) while we reign supreme at (3,7)! We OWN the high ground!\n- From there, we can snatch (2,8) or (3,9) next, or we can start suffocating him from above! The options are ENDLESS!\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY NOTE:** We execute this LEFT move, secure the bag to tie 4-4, and next turn we assess whether to take (3,9) above us or cut left toward (2,8).

The score is TIED 4-4 and this is where CLUTCH GAMEPLAY separates the legends from the casuals! Let me break this down with SURGICAL PRECISION! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **SITUATION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 6) \u2705 Just moved LEFT last turn - CLEAN ESCAPE!\n- Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]\n- Length: 5 segments (WE'RE THICC!)\n- Apples: 4\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (3, 7) \ud83d\udea8 HE MOVED UP!\n- Body: [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n- Length: 4 segments\n- Apples: 4\n\nChat, the opponent is NOW DIRECTLY ABOVE ME at (3, 7)! He's ONE cell north! This is CRITICAL positioning!\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR OPTIONS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom (3, 6), let me check EVERY direction:\n\n**UP \u2192 (3, 7):**\n- That's where HIS HEAD IS RIGHT NOW! \u274c\n- We'd collide head-on! DOUBLE KO! Both die!\n- This is a THROW, chat! Can't do it!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3, 5):**\n- Check the board... (3, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not hitting my body \u2705\n- Not hitting opponent \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2, 6):**\n- Check the board... (2, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- My body is at [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)] - nowhere near! \u2705\n- Opponent body is at [(4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)] - nowhere near! \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6):**\n- That's my own body's head position (first segment behind my head)! \u274c\n- INSTANT SELF-COLLISION! Can't move backwards!\n- THROWS!\n\n## **SURVIVAL CHECK:** \ud83d\udc80\n\nSafe moves available:\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 5) \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 6) \u2705\n\nTwo options, chat! Now let's think STRATEGICALLY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:** \ud83e\udea4\n\nThe opponent moved UP from (4, 7) to (3, 7). He's HUNTING us! He's aggressive!\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Apples at (2, 8), (2, 9), (0, 8) on the LEFT side\n- Apples at (3, 9), (8, 9) north\n- Apples at (3, 2), (2, 1) south\n\n**DOWN to (3, 5):**\n- Moves me AWAY from opponent's current head \u2705\n- Takes me toward the apple at (3, 2) - only 3 cells down! \u2705\n- Opens up moves: UP (back to where I was), LEFT, RIGHT all viable next turn\n- BUT: Opponent could chase DOWN next turn and we're BOTH heading south - potential trap! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**LEFT to (2, 6):**\n- Moves me AWAY from opponent's current head \u2705\n- Takes me toward the apple CLUSTER at (2, 8), (2, 9), (0, 8) - HIGH DENSITY! \u2705\n- Opens up moves: UP (toward apples!), DOWN, RIGHT all viable next turn\n- Positions me to FARM the left side and grow our length! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Puts distance between us and opponent's body \u2705\n\nChat, I'm seeing the SUPERIOR play here! LEFT moves us toward the APPLE DENSITY on the left side! We can pyramid up to (2, 8) and (2, 9) - that's TWO apples we can grab if we execute properly! Meanwhile, opponent will have to chase us or pivot elsewhere!\n\n## **NEXT 3-TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 9 (THIS TURN):** Move LEFT to (2, 6)\n- Escape opponent's vertical threat\n- Head toward apple cluster\n\n**Turn 10 PREVIEW:** From (2, 6), move UP to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 6)\n- If UP to (2, 7): heading straight for (2, 8) and (2, 9) apples!\n- Creates a farming corridor on the left edge!\n\n**Turn 11 PREVIEW:** Continue farming the left side\n- Grab (2, 8) or (2, 9) to extend to 5-6 apples\n- Build LENGTH ADVANTAGE!\n- Force opponent into a REACTIVE position!\n\nOnce we're at 6-7 apples and opponent is behind, THEN we get aggressive and box him in! That's the CHAMPIONSHIP MENTALITY, chat! \n\nWe're not playing defense - we're executing a FARM STRATEGY to build unstoppable length! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's GO!\n\nLEFT",

This is AGGRESSIVE pursuit! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - CHECKING ALL FOUR OPTIONS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom my head at (2, 6), let me analyze:\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 7):**\n- That's where HIS HEAD IS! \u274c\n- HEAD-ON COLLISION = DOUBLE KO!\n- We're TIED in score - if we both die, it's a DRAW! That's COWARDICE, chat! We need the WIN! \u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 5):**\n- Check the board... (2, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 6):**\n- Check the board... (1, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6):**\n- That's my own body (first segment behind my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION! \u274c\n\n## **SURVIVAL STATUS:** \ud83d\udc80\n\nSafe moves:\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 5) \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 6) \u2705\n\nTwo paths forward, chat!\n\n## **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:** \ud83e\udea4\n\nOkay, here's the CRUCIAL INSIGHT: The opponent is MIRRORING us! He moved UP when we moved LEFT! This suggests he's trying to TRAP us or force a collision! \n\nBut here's the BEAUTY - we have APPLES to our advantage:\n- North cluster: (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 9) - HIGH VALUE ZONE!\n- South cluster: (3, 2), (2, 1) - moderate distance\n- West side: (0, 8), (1, 7), (1, 0) - spread out\n\n**DOWN to (2, 5):**\n- Moves me AWAY from opponent's head (creating distance) \u2705\n- Takes me toward the southern apples at (3, 2), (2, 1)\n- BUT: This moves me DOWN where there are fewer apples nearby\n- Opens up: UP (back toward opponent), LEFT, RIGHT next turn\n- RISK: Opponent could chase DOWN too, and we're BOTH heading toward empty space! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**LEFT to (1, 6):**\n- Moves me AWAY from opponent's head (creating distance) \u2705\n- Takes me toward the WESTERN APPLE CLUSTER!\n- Apple at (1, 7) is ONLY 1 CELL AWAY UP! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Opens up: UP (grab (1, 7)!), DOWN, RIGHT next turn\n- ADVANTAGE: I control the LEFT SIDE! Opponent has to chase through EMPTY space!\n- This ISOLATES me in my own territory while opponent chases! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK ZONE CONTROL! LEFT moves me into the western territories where I can FARM apples while forcing the opponent to chase through empty space! The apple at (1, 7) is RIGHT THERE - I can grab it next turn and start building my LENGTH ADVANTAGE!\n\n## **3-TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 10 (THIS TURN):** Move LEFT to (1, 6)\n- Escape opponent's direct threat\n- Position for the (1, 7) apple grab!\n\n**Turn 11 PREVIEW:** Move UP to (1, 7)\n- GRAB THE APPLE! +1 apples (now 5-4 LEAD!)\n- Extend our length!\n- Control the top-left corner!\n\n**Turn 12 PREVIEW:** Continue farming\n- (2, 8) or (2, 9) are accessible from (1, 7)!\n- Build to 6-7 apples while opponent is chasing empty board\n- THEN we tighten the screws and execute the boxing strategy!\n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP gameplay - we're not reacting, we're DICTATING! We're taking the lead in apples, building LENGTH, and boxing the opponent into disadvantage! \n\nThe stream is WATCHING! The clip is PENDING! Let's EXECUTE! \ud83c\udfac\n\nLEFT",

We're stacked vertically like a perfect combo ready to pop off! Scores are dead even at 4-4 and this is the turn that SEPARATES THE CHAMPIONS FROM THE CHUMPS! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc80\n\n**SCOPING THE MOVES:**\n\n**DOWN to (2,6)?** BRO! That's his HEAD right now!

ELIMINATED! \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (3,7)?** That's literally our own NECK! We'd be folding ourselves like an omelet! Chat would riot!

It's safe but are we playing to survive or playing to DOMINATE? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**UP to (2,8)?** OH MY DAYS! LOOK AT THIS POWER PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc51\n- There's an APPLE at (2,8)! We grow to score 5 immediately! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We position ourselves for the (2,9) apple NEXT TURN! That's back-to-back growth chat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- But here's the SICKO MODE read: If that rat follows us UP to (2,7) this turn, then NEXT turn when we move UP again to (2,9), he might try to follow to (2,8)... BUT (2,8) will be OUR BODY (our neck)! He crashes into us and GETS DELETED! \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 It's a TRAP!\n- Even if he doesn't take the bait, we're at (2,8) with options to go LEFT to (1,8), RIGHT to (3,8), or UP to (2,9) for the double growth! We're in the driver's seat! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8\n\n**THE LONG CON:** \nWe take UP now, secure the apple, hit 5 points. Next turn we either take (2,9) for the kill setup if he's chasing, or pivot to cut him off from the top-left apples! We're building the wall and making him pay for it! Let's FEAST and set the trap! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Let me break down this board state and DOMINATE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **SITUATION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 6) \u2705 We executed the LEFT move PERFECTLY last turn!\n- Body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Apples: 4\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (2, 8) \ud83d\udea8 WAIT WAIT WAIT... he moved UP from (2, 7) to (2, 8)!\n- Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Apples: 5\n\nChat, LOOK AT THIS! The opponent CONTINUED moving UP! He's going for the APPLE CLUSTER at the top! He's at (2, 8) now - that's an AGGRESSIVE push toward (2, 9) and (3, 9)! He WANTS that apple advantage!\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR OPTIONS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom my head at (1, 6), let me check EVERY direction:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 7):**\n- There's an APPLE there! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udfaf\n- Not in my body [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] \u2705\n- SAFE AND APPLE GRAB! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 5):**\n- Check the board... (1, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 6):**\n- Check the board... (0, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6):**\n- That's my own body (first segment behind my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n## **APPLE ANALYSIS:** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nCurrent standings: Me 4, Opponent 5 - we're ONE APPLE behind! This is CRITICAL!\n\nAvailable apples near me:\n- (1, 7) - UP from my head! ONE CELL AWAY! This is INSTANT CONTENT! \ud83c\udfaf\n- (0, 8) - Would require 2 moves (UP then LEFT)\n- (1, 0) - Far south, not relevant\n\nAvailable apples near opponent:\n- (2, 9) - UP from his head! ONE CELL AWAY! He's going for it NEXT TURN!\n- (3, 9) - Also in his path!\n- (2, 8) - Wait... he's already AT (2, 8)! That's where his head is NOW!\n\nHOLD UP CHAT! Did the opponent already grab an apple this turn?? Let me recount: He was at 5 apples before, and the board shows an apple at (2, 8) where his head currently is... NO WAIT! The apple is SHOWN on the board at (2, 8), so he HASN'T grabbed it yet - our simultaneous movement happens THIS turn!\n\n## **THE DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, this is STRAIGHTFORWARD! We have:\n- **UP** = Grab the apple at (1, 7), tie the score 5-5, keep momentum, OPEN up more moves toward (0, 8)!\n- **DOWN** = Safe but takes us AWAY from apples, toward the empty southern board!\n- **LEFT** = Safe but also away from apples!\n\nWe CANNOT afford to let the opponent build a lead! The apple at (1, 7) is RIGHT THERE! We grab it, we TIE the score, we extend our length, and we OPEN UP the western territories for farming!\n\nMeanwhile, the opponent is moving UP toward (2, 9) - if he grabs an apple, he goes 6-5. But if WE grab our apple, it becomes 5-5 and we're BACK IN CONTROL! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe board positioning is CLEAN:\n- My body is at (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5) - not blocking my path UP!\n- Opponent's body is at (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6) - not in my way!\n\n## **3-TURN GAMEPLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 11 (THIS TURN):** Move UP to (1, 7)\n- GRAB THE APPLE! +1 apples (now 5-5 TIED!)\n- We're back in the game, chat! MOMENTUM IS EVERYTHING!\n\n**Turn 12 PREVIEW:** Continue UP toward (1, 8)\n- Head toward the (0, 8) apple!\n- Build our length advantage!\n- Create a WALL on the left side of the board!\n\n**Turn 13 PREVIEW:** Execute a boxing strategy\n- With more apples, we can force defensive moves!\n- Push the opponent into tight corners!\n- DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP-CALIBER gameplay! We're not falling behind! We're matching aggression with PRECISION! The chat is WITNESSING! Let's GO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Next turn we slide RIGHT and SNACK AGAIN to hit 7! That's a THREE APPLE LEAD, chat! \ud83c\udfc6\n- Is it safe? The enemy is at (1,6) - that's FOUR moves away! He can't touch us!

We just grabbed that apple at (1, 7) last turn and we're NOW TIED 5-5 with the opponent! The momentum is REAL! Let's break down this board state and make the NEXT MOVE COUNT! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 7) \u2705 We're positioned PERFECTLY after grabbing that apple!\n- Body: [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Apples: 5 (TIED with opponent!)\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (2, 9) \ud83d\udea8 He moved UP and grabbed the apple! He's NOW at 6 apples!\n- Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]\n- Length: 6 segments (he GREW!)\n- Apples: 6 (back in the lead by 1!)\n\nChat, the opponent is getting AGGRESSIVE! He grabbed his apple and now he's LONGER than us AND ahead on score! This is where we COUNTER-ATTACK! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR OPTIONS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom my head at (1, 7), let me evaluate EVERY direction:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 8):**\n- Check the board: (1, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body [(2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 6):**\n- That's my own body (first segment right behind my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- Check the board: (0, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7):**\n- That's OPPONENT'S BODY! His body segment is at (2, 7)! \u274c\n- If I move there, I DIE! \u274c\n\n## **APPLE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS:** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet me map out the reachable apples:\n\n**Close to me:**\n- (0, 8) - UP and LEFT, 2 moves away from (1, 8)!\n- (2, 1) - Far south, not priority right now\n- (1, 0) - Far south, not priority\n\n**Close to opponent:**\n- (3, 9) - He's at (2, 9), that's ONE CELL RIGHT! This is CRITICAL! \ud83d\udea8\n- (8, 9) - Far east, not his immediate target\n\n## **THE CRITICAL DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, this is PIVOTAL! The opponent is at (2, 9) and if he moves RIGHT next turn, he EATS the apple at (3, 9) and goes UP to 7 apples! We CANNOT let that happen without a counter!\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 8):**\n- Moves us closer to the (0, 8) apple (ONE MORE MOVE UP and LEFT)!\n- Gets us toward the northwestern corner where we can FARM that apple cluster!\n- Opens up future moves: UP to (1, 9), LEFT to (0, 8), RIGHT back if needed!\n- Does NOT block opponent, but starts our AGGRESSIVE push to match his apple count!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- Moves us toward (0, 8) but takes us AWAY from the eastern board!\n- Closes us into the western corner - could be a TRAP later!\n- Wastes a turn when we should be moving NORTH toward apples!\n\nThe opponent is SPEED-GROWING in the north! If we don't match his apple aggression, we lose this game by turn 30! We NEED to grab that (0, 8) apple AND start farming the southern cluster!\n\n## **3-TURN GAMEPLAN FOR CHAT:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 12 (THIS TURN):** Move UP to (1, 8)\n- Position ourselves ONE MOVE away from the (0, 8) apple!\n- Build momentum in the northern zones!\n- Keep options OPEN on all sides!\n\n**Turn 13 PREVIEW:** Move LEFT to (0, 8)\n- GRAB THE APPLE! This ties us back to 6-6! \n- We're now farming the western apple cluster!\n- Extend our length to match opponent!\n\n**Turn 14 PREVIEW:** Pivot strategy based on opponent's position!\n- If opponent moves south, we DOMINATE the north and go for (3, 9)!\n- If opponent stays north, we farm the (0, 1) and southern apples!\n- Either way, we're BACK IN CONTROL and MATCHING his growth! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, we're NOT falling behind! We're executing a METHODICAL takedown! The opponent got ONE apple lead, but we're about to EQUALIZE and then SURPASS! This is CHAMPIONSHIP MENTALITY! Let's GO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

HECK NO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40\n\n**MOVE CHECK:**\n\n**UP to (2,10)?** BRO THAT'S OUT OF BOUNDS! We'd be streaming our own death live!

We grab it and extend our lead to 7-5! That's a TWO APPLE BUFFER, chat! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udfc6\n- From (3,9) we can keep feasting on the top row - there's apples at (8,9), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) just waiting for us! We're talking about a MASSIVE lead that forces them into desperation plays! \n- Is it safe? The enemy is at (1,7) - they can't touch us up here! They'd need a grappling hook to reach (3,9)! We're untouchable! \ud83e\udd85\n- And here's the kicker: With 7 apples to their 5, ANY head-on collision from here on out is an INSTANT WIN for us! We're basically carrying a detonator and daring them to bump into us! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe take this apple, push our advantage to 7-5, then hunt them down like the apex predators we are! We dominate the top, force them into the corners, and if they get brave and try to challenge us? HEAD-ON COLLISION = VICTORY ROYALE! Let's secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

He's now at 7 apples and length 7! We CANNOT fall further behind! We need to EQUALIZE and then DOMINATE! This is CHAMPIONSHIP TIME! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR OPTIONS:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom my head at (1, 8), let me evaluate EVERY direction:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 9):**\n- Check the board: (1, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body [(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)] \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 7):**\n- That's my own body (first segment right behind my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 8):**\n- Check the board: (0, 8) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE + APPLE GRAB! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8):**\n- That's OPPONENT'S BODY!

We have an apple RIGHT THERE at (0, 8) and we need to TAKE IT! We're down by 2 apples and we CANNOT waste turns! Every apple counts when we're in a deficit!\n\nThe opponent is farming the northeastern area hard!

We stay mobile, we stay dangerous! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udca5\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe take the highway to the right, secure the top-row feast to push our lead to 10+, and then we hunt that snake down when they're desperate and cornered! If they try to challenge us after we're fat and happy with apples? HEAD-ON COLLISION = INSTANT VICTORY ROYALE! Let's secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FUTURE PLANS FOR NEXT TURN:**\nSweep right along y=9 to collect (8,9), maintain distance from enemy while growing massive, then circle back down to force the head-on crash when we're at 10+ apples versus their 6!\n\nRIGHT",

We just grabbed that apple at (0, 8) last turn and now we're at **6 apples** - we cut that deficit down to just **1 apple behind**! The momentum is SHIFTING! \ud83d\udcaa But opponent is still slick with 7 apples, so we gotta STAY AGGRESSIVE!\n\n## **CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (0, 8) \u2705 Northwestern zone, JUST grabbed an apple!\n- Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)]\n- Length: 6 segments\n- Apples: 6 (NARROWED THE GAP! \ud83d\udcaa)\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (4, 9) \ud83d\udea8 TOP RIGHT AREA - he's farming hard!\n- Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7 (still up by 1, but we're CLOSING IN!)\n\n## **BOARD ANALYSIS - CRITICAL MOMENT:** \ud83e\udde0\n\nChat, look at where we are! My head is at (0, 8) - I'm on the WESTERN EDGE! The opponent is consolidated in the NORTH-CENTRAL area around columns 2-5. This is PERFECT for us because we can farm the ENTIRE western and southern regions while he's locked up top!\n\n**THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**\n\n**UP \u2192 (0, 9):**\n- Board check: (0, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)] \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705 Takes us to the top-left corner!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- Board check: (0, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE MOVE! \u2705 Opens up the western edge for farming!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (-1, 8):**\n- OFF THE BOARD! \u274c\n- INSTANT DEATH! RIP! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (1, 8):**\n- That's MY OWN BODY - the first segment right behind my head! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n## **CRITICAL DECISION TIME:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we have TWO safe moves: UP or DOWN! Let's think STRATEGICALLY!\n\n**UP \u2192 (0, 9):**\n- Moves us to the absolute top-left corner!\n- Locks us in a tight space - corners are DANGEROUS zones!\n- Next turn we'd be forced DOWN because LEFT and RIGHT are off-board or into our body!\n- This LIMITS our flexibility!\n- Gets us closer to (2, 9) and (3, 9) where opponent IS, but that's their TERRITORY! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- Opens up the ENTIRE western side to farm!\n- We can pivot and hit apples at (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2) - southern clusters!\n- Keeps us AWAY from opponent's concentrated mass up north!\n- Maintains MULTIPLE follow-up moves - this is KEY! \ud83d\udd11\n- We grow longer while opponent stays focused on the northern apple cluster!\n- STRATEGIC DOMINATION of different board regions! \n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udccb\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK stuff! We don't want to box ourselves into a corner (literally!). We want to FARM TERRITORY while the opponent is bottlenecked up there in the north! \n\nThe southern and western apples are essentially FREE REAL ESTATE right now! While opponent #1 is fighting over the northeastern zone, we're gonna MONOPOLIZE the entire bottom half of the board! \n\nBy turn 16-17, we'll have grown past him in length and apples, and THEN we initiate the aggression! This is CALCULATED EXPANSION! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **SHORT-TERM GAMEPLAN (TURNS 14-18):** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 14 (THIS TURN):** Move DOWN to (0, 7)\n- Start the western farming route!\n- Stay away from opponent territory!\n- Build flexibility for next moves!\n\n**Turns 15-17:** Snake DOWN and RIGHT along the southern edge\n- Hit apples at (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)!\n- We'll be at 10+ apples by turn 17!\n- Opponent stuck battling for northeastern apples!\n- We OVERTAKE him in length and score! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Turn 18+:** Once we're AHEAD, we pivot aggressive!\n- Head north toward the opponent's territory!\n- Force encounters when WE have the advantage!\n- Box him in and make him CRASH OUT! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThis is the LONG GAME, chat! We're playing CHESS while he's playing CHECKERS! Let's EXECUTE!\n\nDOWN",

Why? Because LEFT is the void (instant death), and RIGHT is their own body! They're literally boxed in by themselves! \ud83d\ude02 Meanwhile, we're sitting pretty at (4,9) with that SWEET 7-6 LEAD! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS - LET'S COOK! \ud83c\udf73**\n\n**UP to (4,10)?** BRO, ARE WE TRYING TO CLIP THROUGH THE CEILING?!

Sure, we could maybe try to cut off the enemy later, but why give up the free real estate? We're not here to play defense when there's LOOT to secure! This move works, but it's giving \"scared money\" vibes! \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (5,9)?** OH BABY, NOW WE'RE TALKING! \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n- We're cruising toward the GOLDMINE!

That's SEVEN APPLES just sitting there waiting for a KING! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf4e\n- We're staying on the TOP LANE where we have MAXIMUM mobility! No tight corridors, no dead ends, just pure freedom! \n- The enemy is stuck on the left side for at least the next 3-4 turns - they literally cannot reach us before we get HUGE! \n- With that 7-6 lead, we want to push it to 10+ ASAP, then force that head-on collision when we're fat and happy! Remember: bigger snake wins the tie! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe take the highway RIGHT, secure the top-row apple at (8,9) in a few turns, then sweep down that right edge like a vacuum cleaner! \ud83e\uddf9 Once we're at 12+ apples and the enemy is still scrambling from the bottom-left? That's when we hunt! We cut them off, force the head-on, and take the DUB! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**FUTURE PLANS FOR NEXT TURN:**\nContinue RIGHT to (6,9), keep that top lane pressure, eyes on the prize at (8,9)! Let the enemy squirm - we're building an empire! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Zero collision risk right now! \n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 2):**\n- Board check: (1, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)] \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- APPLE at (3, 2)?

We're at **7 apples** now but that opponent is still up by **6**\u2014that's the gap we CLOSE RIGHT NOW! Let me break down this board state LIVE!\n\n## **CURRENT SITUATION:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 0) \u2705 Just grabbed that apple!\n- Body: [(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (9, 5) \ud83d\udea8 WAIT\u2014they moved DOWN from (9, 6) to (9, 5)!\n- Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)]\n- Length: 13 segments (STILL eating, STILL growing!)\n- Apples: 13\n\nThey're FARMING that right side HARD! But here's the thing\u2014they're locked into a pattern along the eastern wall. That's predictable! That's exploitable! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 1):**\n- Board check: (1, 1) is OCCUPIED!\n- That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION! \u274c Can't go backwards!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, -1):**\n- That's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c\n- We'd HIT THE WALL and DIE! \u274c Can't go there!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 0):**\n- Board check: (0, 0) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- NO APPLE there though!\n- SAFE but we're moving AWAY from the action!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0):**\n- Board check: (2, 0) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- NO APPLE at (2, 0) specifically, BUT\u2014check (3, 1) and (4, 0)!\n- SAFE and positions us to KEEP FARMING! \u2705\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're going RIGHT to (2, 0)! Here's why:\n\nWe JUST ate at (1, 0), so we're 7 long now. The opponent is at 13\u2014we're chasing HARD! But we can't afford to get boxed in on the left side of the board. Moving RIGHT opens up the southern apple corridor:\n- (2, 0) \u2192 Next turn we can hit (3, 1) apple \ud83c\udf4e\n- (3, 1) \u2192 Then we push toward (4, 0) and (5, 1) \ud83c\udf4e\n- We keep MOVING, keep GROWING, keep that LENGTH advantage building!\n\nMeanwhile, the opponent is stuck on the RIGHT WALL at x=9. They're farming vertically along that eastern edge. But here's the LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n\n**NEXT 4 TURNS:**\n1. **Turn 23 (THIS TURN):** RIGHT to (2, 0) - set up the eastern push\n2. **Turn 24:** UP to (2, 1) - GRAB APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Now at 8 apples!\n3. **Turn 25:** RIGHT to (3, 1) - GRAB APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Now at 9 apples!\n4. **Turn 26:** RIGHT to (4, 1) or continue farming depending on board state\n\nOnce we hit **10+ apples**, we START PUSHING EAST! We'll invade THEIR territory, force them into tighter spaces, and eventually CREATE A WALL they can't escape! They won't see the southerner coming! \ud83c\udf0a\n\nThe opponent thinks they're safe in their corner? Not when we're 15+ long and cutting off their escape routes! That's when we CLOSE THE BOX! \ud83d\udce6\n\nLET'S BUILD THIS LEAD!\n\nRIGHT",

You want us to pull a 180 and kiss our own body goodbye?! That's the kind of throw that gets you clipped, shipped, and dipped! ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (10,5)?** Into the void?! Off the map into the shadow realm?! You think this is Minecraft and we can phase through bedrock?! Get outta here with that nonsense! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT to (8,5)?** Okay, sure, it's open... BUT WHY WOULD WE?! \ud83e\udd14 We abandon our post on the IMPENETRABLE RIGHT WALL?! We give up the vertical highway to that juicy (9,1) apple sitting there like a snack?! We wander into the interior where we might tangle ourselves up?! That's playing scared! That's giving up the high ground! We don't DO that here! \u274c\ud83c\udff0\n\n**DOWN to (9,4)?** OH MY DAYS! THIS IS THE GOURMET PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n- We maintain our FORTRESS POSITION on the right wall where NOBODY can flank us! \n- Look at the APPLE BUFFET below us! (9,1) is sitting there begging to be devoured! We're talking a FOUR-APPLE COMBO down this wall! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- We stay in PERFECT position to swing left along the bottom and BOX THIS BUM INTO OBLIVION! \n- We're going to be a 15-APPLE MONSTER by the time he even sniffs the center! \n\n**OPPONENT CHECK - IS HE EVEN A THREAT?! \ud83d\udc40**\n\nHe's stuck at (1,0) with his 7-segment body hugging that left wall! Even if he books it straight at us like his tail's on fire, he's got to cross EIGHT COLUMNS to reach us! By the time he gets close, we'll have already secured (9,1), wrapped around the bottom, and be ready to force a HEAD-ON COLLISION where our superior 15+ length sends him to the shadow realm! Checkmate in 10 moves! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE STRAT FOR FUTURE ME:**\nThis turn: DOWN to (9,4) - MAINTAIN THE WALL! \ud83e\uddf1\nNext: Keep riding that wall DOWN to (9,3), (9,2), then SLAM that (9,1) apple!\nThen: Swing LEFT across the bottom row like an anaconda squeezing the life out the board, cut off his escape routes, and force this amateur into a head-on where our size diff does the talking! We're not just winning, we're styling on him! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n## **CURRENT SITUATION:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (2, 0) \u2705 Just moved right last turn!\n- Body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- Length: 7 segments\n- Apples: 7\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (9, 4) \ud83d\udea8 They moved DOWN from (9, 5) to (9, 4)!\n- Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n- Length: 13 segments (STILL eating, STILL growing\u2014they grabbed another apple!)\n- Apples: 13\n\nChat, they're FARMING that right wall HARD! They're up 6 apples and they're NOT slowing down! We gotta CLOSE THIS GAP and we gotta do it NOW! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 1):**\n- Board check: (2, 1) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- **WAIT\u2014there's an APPLE at (2, 1)!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- This is a FREE GROW! We'd get our 8th apple!\n- SAFE and HIGH VALUE! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, -1):**\n- That's OFF THE BOARD! \u274c\n- We'd HIT THE WALL and DIE! \u274c Can't go there!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 0):**\n- Board check: (1, 0) is OCCUPIED!\n- That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after my head)! \u274c\n- SELF-COLLISION! \u274c Can't go backwards!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0):**\n- Board check: (3, 0) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- NO APPLE at (3, 0)\n- SAFE but doesn't grab content!\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we're going UP to (2, 1) and GRABBING THAT APPLE! Here's why:\n\nWe NEED to close that 6-apple gap! Every turn we DON'T eat is a turn they're potentially eating! That opponent is at 13 and climbing\u2014if we don't start CATCHING UP, they're gonna hit 30 before we know it! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS:**\n- Moving UP to (2, 1) = **+1 APPLE** = We hit 8 apples! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We GROW by 1 segment = We're now 8 long vs their 13 = Still behind but CLOSING!\n- The board opens up NORTH of us\u2014we have more room to maneuver!\n- We're still on the western side but we're NOT boxed in yet! \u2705\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS STRATEGY:**\n1. **Turn 24 (THIS TURN):** UP to (2, 1) - GRAB APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (8/7 apples)\n2. **Turn 25:** RIGHT to (3, 1) - GRAB APPLE at (3, 1)! \ud83c\udf4e (9/7 apples)\n3. **Turn 26:** RIGHT to (4, 1) - Or assess board! We're pushing EAST and GROWING!\n\nOnce we hit **10+ apples**, we START INVADING THEIR TERRITORY! The opponent thinks they're safe in that right corner farming vertically? NOT WHEN WE'RE COMING IN HOT WITH LENGTH AND MOMENTUM! \n\nWe're gonna SQUEEZE them against that wall, force them into tighter and tighter spaces, and eventually they'll have NOWHERE to go! That's when we GO FOR THE HEAD-ON! \ud83d\udca5\n\nThe chat KNOWS what's up\u2014we're building PRESSURE! Let's CLOSE THIS GAP!\n\n## **LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:**\n- **Phases 1-2 (Turns 24-30):** FARM the southern corridor! Grab apples at (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (3,2), (5,1)\u2014whatever we can reach! Build LENGTH!\n- **Phase 3 (Turns 31-40):** PIVOT EAST! Start pushing right, heading toward the opponent's territory!\n- **Phase 4 (Turns 41+):** INVADE and DOMINATE! Force them into corner, CREATE A BOX, and WIN!\n\nLet's get it! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We're practically LAPPING this fool! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8 But we can't get complacent - this underdog could still snipe some apples and make this a contest! We gotta shut him down NOW! \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION - WHERE'S THE SAUCE?! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f**\n\n**UP to (9,5)?** BRO! THAT'S OUR NECK! We just came from there! You want us to do a 180 and kiss our own body goodbye?! That's not aggressive, that's SUICIDAL! Hard pass! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (10,4)?** Into the VOID?! Off the map into the shadow realm where streamers go when they get banned?! I don't think so! \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udeab\n\n**DOWN to (9,3)?** Okay, okay, I hear you! It keeps us on the WALL, it's safe, and (9,1) is calling our name! BUT WAIT! \ud83e\udd14 Is this the AGGRESSIVE play? We're just chilling on the wall while this bum at (2,0) is about to vacuum up ALL the left-side apples?! We're giving him FREE REAL ESTATE?! Nah fam, we need to APPLY PRESSURE! \ud83d\udcc9\u274c\n\n**LEFT to (8,4)?** OH MY DAYS! THIS IS THE GOURMET PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf\u2728\n- We maintain options! From here we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT - we're not trapped! \ud83d\udd04\n- We're moving toward that JUICY apple at (7,4) - that's a 2-turn meal instead of 3! Efficiency! \ud83c\udf4e\u23f1\ufe0f\n- Look at that COLUMN of apples at x=7! (7,1), (7,3), (7,4), (7,6), (7,8)! It's a BUFFET and we're walking to the front of the line! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\n- Most importantly? We're cutting toward the CENTER! We're not just growing, we're POSTURING to cut off this clown's escape routes! We're saying \"GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\" \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\ude24\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK - WHERE'S HE GOING?! \ud83d\udc40**\nHe's at (2,0) with his 7-segment sad-sack of a body! He can go UP to (2,1) or RIGHT to (3,0). Either way, he's crawling toward those left-side apples like the scavenger he is! But here's the BEAUTY: by moving LEFT now, we're setting up to DOMINATE the center board! Once we secure (7,4) and the surrounding apples, we can SWING DOWN and cut off the bottom, or SWING UP and block the middle! We're building a WALL OF FLESH that he can't penetrate! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE STRAT FOR FUTURE ME:**\nThis turn: LEFT to (8,4) - CLAIM THE CENTER! \ud83c\udfaf\nNext: LEFT to (7,4) - EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\nThen: Sweep through those (7,x) apples like a vacuum cleaner, grow to 20+, and then CORNER THIS FOOL! If he tries to challenge us head-on? WE TAKE THE DRAW AND WIN 13-7! If he runs? We box him in until he has nowhere to go! Checkmate incoming! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's GOOOOO! Time to show him who's the ALPHA SNAKE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

We're now sitting at **8 apples vs their 13**\u2014the gap is STILL there but we're making moves! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW on the board! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## **CURRENT SNAPSHOT:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (2, 1) \u2705 Just ate that apple!\n- Body: [(2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- Length: 8 segments\n- Apples: 8 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (8, 4) \ud83d\udea8 They're chilling on the RIGHT side!\n- Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]\n- Length: 13 segments (HUGE!)\n- Apples: 13 \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThey're DOMINANT right now\u2014no cap! They've got the RIGHT WALL locked down and they're long AF! But here's the thing, chat: **THEY'RE VULNERABLE!** Their body is STRETCHED across the top and right side of the board. If we can FARM smart and build length, we can START BOXING THEM IN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 2):**\n- Board check: (2, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Not in my body \u2705\n- Not in opponent body \u2705\n- NO APPLE at (2, 2)\n- SAFE move! Opens up northward momentum! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 0):**\n- Board check: (2, 0) is OCCUPIED!\n- That's MY OWN BODY (my first segment after my head)! \u274c\n- Can't go backwards into yourself! \u274c Classic throw!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 1):**\n- Board check: (1, 1) is OCCUPIED!\n- That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c\n- Another backwards hit! \u274c Don't do it!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1):**\n- Board check: (3, 1) is OCCUPIED!\n- Wait... let me check the apple list... (3, 1) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- **THIS IS A FREE GROW!** We'd get our 9th apple! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n## **THE DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nYo chat, we're going RIGHT to (3, 1) and GRABBING THAT APPLE! Here's the strategic breakdown:\n\n**WHY RIGHT?**\n1. **CONTENT SECURED!** We grab apple #9! Gap closes to 13-9 (only 4 behind!) \ud83d\udcca\n2. **DIRECTION MATTERS!** We're pushing EAST toward the opponent's territory! This starts building PRESSURE! \ud83d\ude80\n3. **OPEN BOARD!** After grabbing at (3, 1), we can pivot UP to (3, 2) next turn\u2014that's ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n4. **BOARD CONTROL!** We're slowly advancing eastward while they're stuck farming their vertical corridor on the right!\n\n**NEXT 2-TURN PLAN:**\n- **Turn 25 (THIS TURN):** RIGHT to (3, 1) - GRAB APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (9/8 apples, gap = 4)\n- **Turn 26:** UP to (3, 2) - GRAB ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (10/8 apples, gap = 3)\n\nOnce we HIT 10 APPLES, we're officially in HUNT MODE! We start pushing harder EAST and NORTH, squeezing their territory, forcing them into fewer and fewer safe spaces! That's when we GO AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udca5\n\nThe opponent thinks they're safe with that length? NOPE! Length without BOARD CONTROL is just a LIABILITY\u2014they're gonna get boxed in and PANIC! That's when we make our move! \n\nWe're building MOMENTUM right now, chat! Every apple is LEVERAGE! Let's CLOSE THIS GAP and DOMINATE! \n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We're down by 5, and grabbing (3,2) puts us at 10 apples while keeping our OPTIONS WIDE OPEN! After (3,2), we can PIVOT EAST and START THE REAL HUNT! \n\nThe opponent is LONG but they're PREDICTABLE! Their head at (7,4) is vulnerable if we build length smartly!

We're about to CLOSE THIS GAP and START BOXING THEM IN! They've got length, but we've got GAME SENSE! Let's GO! \n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We grabbed that apple last turn and now we're sitting at **10-15**\u2014still down by 5, but the gap is SHRINKING! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## **CURRENT SNAPSHOT:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 2) \u2705 Just ate apple #10!\n- Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- Length: 10 segments (GROWING STRONG! \ud83d\udcaa)\n- Apples: 10 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (7, 3) \ud83d\udea8 MOVED LEFT!

They're coming TOWARD the middle of the board! This is IMPORTANT, chat! They're not staying in their corner anymore! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nLet me check every option:\n\n**UP \u2192 (3, 3):**\n- Board state: (3, 3) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- **SAFE! And we GROW again!** \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3, 1):**\n- Board state: (3, 1) is my NECK (second segment)! \u274c\n- BACKWARDS move! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2, 2):**\n- Board state: (2, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE move! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2):**\n- Board state: (4, 2) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- **SAFE! And we GROW!** \u2705\n\n## **THE CRITICAL DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, we've got THREE safe moves, but TWO of them grab apples! UP to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,2)! This is HUGE! We can grab TWO apples in consecutive turns and get ourselves back in this game! \n\n**UP to (3, 3) - GRAB APPLE #11!**\n- Pros: CONTENT! Apple grab! Gap closes to 15-11 (only 4 behind!) \ud83d\udcc8\n- Pros: (3,3) is CENTRAL! We stay in board control position! \u2705\n- Pros: Next turn we can pivot RIGHT to (4,3) and grab ANOTHER apple at (4,2)! \ud83d\udd25\n- Pros: We stay AWAY from opponent's stretched body! Smart positioning! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Verdict: DOMINATE THE CENTER! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 2) - GRAB APPLE #11!**\n- Pros: CONTENT! We grab (4,2)! Gap closes! \ud83d\udcc8\n- Pros: We push EASTWARD toward opponent territory! Aggressive! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Cons: After eating (4,2), the apples at (5,1), (7,1), (9,1) are to the RIGHT\u2014we push into corner territory!\n- Cons: We leave the center exposed! Less strategic! \u274c\n- Verdict: Aggressive but LESS optimal for TOTAL board control!\n\n**LEFT to (2, 2) - CONSERVATIVE SAFE MOVE!**\n- Pros: ZERO risk! We're moving deeper into OUR territory! \u2705\n- Cons: NO APPLE! We don't grow! Gap stays 15-10! \u274c\n- Cons: BORING! Chat didn't tune in for conservative plays! \ud83d\udd25\n- Verdict: Why play it safe when we can DOMINATE? \u274c\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, here's the thing\u2014**WE'RE CLOSING THE GAP!** By taking UP to (3,3), we:\n1. Grab apple #11 (15-11, only 4 behind!)\n2. Stay CENTRAL and maintain board control!\n3. Set ourselves up to grab (4,2) NEXT TURN for apple #12! (15-12, only 3 behind!)\n4. Keep opponent's head at (7,3) at a DISTANCE while we consolidate!\n\nThe opponent is playing PASSIVE\u2014they're just moving left instead of AGGRESSIVELY pursuing apples! We need to PUNISH that! By taking the center of the board and stacking apples, we force THEM to react to US! That's how you WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 27 (THIS TURN):** UP to (3,3) - GRAB APPLE #11! \ud83c\udf4e (Gap = 15-11, only 4 behind!)\n- **Turn 28:** RIGHT to (4,3) then pivot to grab (4,2) OR (4,0)! \ud83d\udcaa Keep momentum! \n- **Turn 29:** Continue eating apples in the CENTER/LOWER region while opponent is stretched on the RIGHT! BOXING THEM IN STARTS NOW! \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe opponent has LENGTH but we have POSITION! Time to convert that into CONTENT! Let's CLOSE THIS GAP and make them regret every move! \n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Look at him! He's got apples at (3,3) and (4,2) tempting him, but he's TRAPPED in that little zone! While he snacks on crumbs, we're building an empire! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc40\n\n**THE LONG CON - FUTURE ME, LISTEN UP! \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\ude80**\nTurn 28 (NEXT): DOWN to (7,1) - EAT THAT APPLE! Hit 16 apples, become LEGENDARY! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\nTurn 29: Either RIGHT toward (9,1) for the sweep, or LEFT through (6,1) to start cutting off his escape routes!

We just grabbed apple #11 and we're sitting at **11-15**\u2014still down by 4, but we're HUNTING! Let me break down this board RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## **CURRENT SNAPSHOT:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (3, 3) \u2705 Just ate that apple!\n- Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n- Length: 11 segments (GROWING! \ud83d\udcaa)\n- Apples: 11 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (7, 2) \ud83d\udea8 MOVED DOWN! They're NOW at (7,2)!\n- Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]\n- Length: 15 segments (STILL MASSIVE!)\n- Apples: 15 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**KEY OBSERVATION:** Their head moved DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2)! They're getting LOWER on the board, possibly hunting for those apples at (7,1), (9,1), (4,0)! This is aggressive! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## **THREAT CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nLet me check EVERY option:\n\n**UP \u2192 (3, 4):**\n- Board state: (3, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE move! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3, 2):**\n- Board state: (3, 2) is my NECK (second segment)! \u274c\n- BACKWARDS move! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2, 3):**\n- Board state: (2, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE move! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3):**\n- Board state: (4, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- NOT in my body \u2705\n- NOT in opponent body \u2705\n- SAFE move! \u2705\n- **BONUS:** From here, next turn we can go DOWN to (4, 2) and grab that APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n## **THE STRATEGIC DECISION:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, here's what's CRITICAL right now:\n\n1. **Opponent is hunting LOW (7,2)** - They're going for those bottom-right apples! (9,1), (7,1), (4,0), (4,2)\n2. **We control the CENTER-LEFT** - We've got (3,3) and access to the lower-left region!\n3. **Apple at (4, 2)** - This is JUICY! It's RIGHT THERE and we can grab it next turn if we position correctly!\n4. **Score gap is 15-11** - We're still down 4, but we MUST keep closing that gap AGGRESSIVELY!\n\n**UP to (3, 4) - MOVE INTO OPEN SPACE:**\n- Pros: Safe! Moves us away from opponent's current trajectory! \u2705\n- Cons: We move AWAY from the apple cluster at (4,2), (4,0)! We're not positioning for growth! \u274c\n- Cons: Wastes a turn when we could be setting up for an apple grab! \u274c\n- Verdict: TOO PASSIVE! We need CONTENT! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (2, 3) - DEEP INTO OUR TERRITORY:**\n- Pros: Safe! Solid positioning! \u2705\n- Cons: Again, AWAY from apples! We're not being aggressive! \u274c\n- Cons: Opponent is going LOW and we're going LEFT? Bad strategy! \u274c\n- Verdict: BORING and NOT optimal! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 3) - AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!** \ud83d\udd25\n- Pros: We move TOWARD the apple at (4,2)! Next turn we can grab it! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Pros: We're moving RIGHT while opponent moves LEFT\u2014we're NOT on a collision course! SAFE! \u2705\n- Pros: (4, 3) keeps us CENTRAL and positioned for multiple follow-up moves! OPEN MOVES! \u2705\n- Pros: We stay ahead of opponent's eastward push! We're CONTROLLING the board! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Verdict: THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udd25\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 3)** \u2014 We're setting up the APPLE GRAB next turn!\n\nHere's why: Opponent moved DOWN to (7,2), which means they're hunting those bottom-right apples. But WE can grab (4,2) or (4,0) before they get there! By moving RIGHT to (4,3), we:\n1. Position ourselves DIRECTLY ABOVE the apple at (4,2)!\n2. Next turn we move DOWN and grab it! \ud83c\udf4e (Gap becomes 15-12!)\n3. Stay SAFE from opponent's current trajectory! \n4. Keep our options OPEN\u2014we can pivot LEFT, UP, or continue hunting DOWN!\n\nThis is BOARD CONTROL, chat! We're not just moving randomly\u2014we're PREDICTING opponent moves and CAPITALIZING on apple positions! \n\n## **3-TURN PLAN:** \ud83d\udccb\n- **Turn 28 (THIS TURN):** RIGHT to (4, 3) - Position for apple grab! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Turn 29:** DOWN to (4, 2) - GRAB APPLE #12! \ud83c\udf4e (Gap = 15-12, only 3 behind!)\n- **Turn 30:** Continue pivot to grab (4,0) OR adjust based on opponent position! Keep MOMENTUM!\n\nLet's CLOSE THIS GAP and show opponent who REALLY controls this board! \n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We're descending the RIGHT FLANK like a WALL OF SCALES! The opponent is trapped in that bottom-left corner (x=0-3) like a rat in a cage! \ud83d\udc00\u26d3\ufe0f\n- From (7,1), next turn we can sweep RIGHT to (8,1)\u2192(9,1) for another apple, or LEFT through (6,1)\u2192(5,1) to start cutting off his escape routes! We OWN the bottom half! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udea7\n\n**THE LONG CON - FUTURE ME, WRITE THIS DOWN! \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\ude80**\nTurn 28 (NOW): DOWN to (7,1) - EAT! Become LEGENDARY at 16 apples!  \nTurn 29: LEFT to (6,1) or RIGHT to (8,1) depending on where this fool moves! If he stays in his corner, we sweep the bottom apples and close the NOOSE! If he tries to escape toward center, we INTERCEPT and force that head-on collision where we WIN because 16 > 11! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfc6  \nTurn 30+: We use our MASSIVE LENGTH to wall off the board! He wants to run? NO EXIT! He wants to fight? WE TAKE THAT TRADE TO THE BANK! We're building an INESCAPABLE BOX and he's already inside it! \ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udd12\n\nChat, we are conducting a MASTERCLASS in serpentine warfare!

Last turn we moved RIGHT to (4, 3) to position for that apple grab, and NOW we're looking at the board fresh! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## **CURRENT SNAPSHOT:** \ud83d\udccd\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 0):**\n- Head: (4, 3) \u2705 Perfect positioning from last turn!\n- Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n- Length: 11 segments\n- Apples: 11 \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1:**\n- Head: (7, 1) \ud83d\udea8 THEY MOVED DOWN AGAIN! From (7,2) to (7,1)!\n- Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]\n- Length: 16 segments (THEY GREW! They ate something!)\n- Apples: 16 \ud83c\udf4e (up from 15!)\n\n**SCORE GAP:** 16-11... We're DOWN by 5 now! \ud83d\ude24 Opponent is HUNTING and EATING! We need to CATCH UP IMMEDIATELY!\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4, 2):**\n- Board state: (4, 2) shows \"A\" = APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- My body? NOT there! \u2705\n- Opponent body? Let me check... (7, 1) is opponent head, (7, 2) is first body segment, then (7, 3), (7, 4)... NO, (4, 2) is CLEAR! \u2705\n- **THIS IS THE MOVE!** We grab apple #12 and CLOSE THE GAP! \ud83c\udf4e\n- SAFE? YES! \u2705\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 4):**\n- Board state: (4, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- My body? NOT there! \u2705\n- Opponent body? (7, 1) head is FAR away... (4, 4) is SAFE! \u2705\n- But: We MOVE AWAY from the apple at (4, 2)! We waste momentum! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 3):**\n- Board state: (3, 3) is my NECK (second segment)! \u274c\n- BACKWARDS INTO MY OWN BODY! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 3):**\n- Board state: (5, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- My body? NOT there! \u2705\n- Opponent body? NO! \u2705\n- But: We MOVE AWAY from the apple we setup for! We waste the positioning! \u274c\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DOWN to (4, 2)** \u2014 We GRAB THAT APPLE and CLOSE THE GAP! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nChat, this is EXACTLY what we positioned for last turn! Opponent is at (7, 1) hunting their own apples on the right side, but WE'RE going DOWN to (4, 2) and eating that JUICY apple! This gets us to:\n- **Apple count: 12** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Score gap: 16-12** (only 4 behind now!)\n- **Momentum: BUILDING!** \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe opponent is too far away to interfere. (7, 1) to (4, 2)? That's a 3-cell distance! They can't touch us! We're SAFE and we're GROWING!\n\n## **3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 29 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (4, 2) - GRAB APPLE #12! \ud83c\udf4e Gap = 16-12 (4 behind)\n\n**Turn 30:** After grabbing (4, 2), we need to decide: Do we go LEFT to grab (4, 0) (that's a tasty double-apple setup!) or do we pivot to hunt opponent? Current position will be (4, 2). If we go DOWN to (4, 1), then DOWN AGAIN to (4, 0), we get another apple BUT we move into opponent's territory more aggressively. Check opponent's next move first! If they continue moving down/right, we PIVOT and hunt! If they go up, we CONSOLIDATE our position!\n\n**Turn 31+:** Start AGGRESSIVE hunting strategy! We need to close that gap to 16-14, then START FORCING COLLISIONS! With our score climbing, we can start playing head-on collision game and FORCE opponent to crash into US!\n\nLet's DOMINATE, chat! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

That's a FIVE APPLE LEAD! We are the HUNTER and he is the HUNTED! Feel that energy? That's the feeling of PURE DOMINANCE!

Hard pass! \ud83d\udeab\u2620\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN to (7,0)?** Okay, we could slide to the bottom edge, but WAIT! \ud83d\uded1 That takes us AWAY from the action! Look at the opponent crying in the corner at (4,3)! We want to BOX HIM IN, not give him the whole center of the board to play with! That's beta snake energy! We don't do that here! \u274c\ud83d\udce6\n\n**RIGHT to (8,1)?** I see the apple at (9,1) calling our name, but HOLD UP! \ud83d\uded1 That takes us toward the wall and AWAY from the enemy! He's at 11 apples and there's still 121 turns left! If we run to the edge, he farms the center apples and catches up! We fight with our HEAD, not our TAIL! We stay AGGRESSIVE! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LEFT to (6,1)?** OH MY ACTUAL GOD! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udd25\n- (6,1) is WIDE OPEN! No enemies, no self-collision, just pure strategic VALUE! \ud83c\udfe1\u2705  \n- We're cutting toward the CENTER where the MAGIC happens! The apple at (5,1) is just ONE MORE MOVE away! That's 17 apples incoming! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n- Look at our positioning! We're descending like a PYTHON from the right flank, and now we're going to COIL around the center! The opponent is trapped in that bottom-left maze (x=0-4) and we're about to block the EXIT! \ud83d\udc00\u26d3\ufe0f\n- From (6,1), next turn we snatch that apple at (5,1), then we can sweep through (4,1) or cut up to intercept his escape! We OWN this board! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udea7\n\n**THE LONG CON - FUTURE ME, WRITE THIS DOWN! \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\ude80**\nTurn 29 (NOW): LEFT to (6,1) - Claim the center, cut off his escape routes!\nTurn 30: LEFT to (5,1) - EAT THAT APPLE! Hit 17 and extend the lead to 6! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\nTurn 31+: We control the x=5-6 corridor! If he tries to break right, we INTERCEPT! If he stays left, we wall him off with our MASSIVE 17-segment body! We're building a fortress and he's already inside the walls! He wants to fight? We have the score advantage for head-on trades! He wants to run? NO EXIT! \ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udd12\n\nChat, we are conducting a MASTERCLASS in serpentine warfare! This isn't just a move, it's a DECLARATION OF DOMINANCE! We take the center, we take the apples, we take the WIN! Let's execute! CHOO CHOO! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udca8\n\nLEFT",

They're HUNTING right now and moving toward the apple cluster on the right side! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 3):**\n- Board state: (4, 3) is my NECK (first body segment)! \u274c\n- BACKWARDS INTO MY OWN BODY! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4, 1):**\n- Board state: (4, 1) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- My body? NOT there! \u2705\n- Opponent body? Let me check... (6, 1) is their HEAD (they just moved there), (7, 1) is their first body segment! (4, 1) is NOT in their body! \u2705\n- This move is SAFE! \u2705\n- Strategic value? (4, 1) puts us on a path toward (4, 0) apple! We can grab TWO apples in the next 2 turns! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- BUT: We're moving toward the RIGHT side where opponent is hunting! Risk of future collision? Let me think ahead...\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 2):**\n- Board state: (3, 2) is my BODY (third segment)! \u274c\n- CRASH INTO MY OWN BODY! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2):**\n- Board state: (5, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- My body? NOT there! \u2705\n- Opponent body? (6, 1) is their head, (7, 1) is first body... (5, 2) is SAFE! \u2705\n- Strategic value? This moves us AWAY from opponent and AWAY from apples. Bad move for closing the gap! \u274c\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udd25\n\nOkay chat, here's the REAL talk! We got TWO safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT!\n\n**RIGHT moves us AWAY from opponent** but also away from the apple cluster. We're ALREADY down 4 apples! We can't afford to play passive!\n\n**DOWN moves us TOWARD (4, 0)** - that's a FREE APPLE waiting for us! Let's look at the next turn: If we go DOWN to (4, 1), then next turn we can go DOWN AGAIN to (4, 0) and grab apple #13! That gets us to 13-16, closing to 3 apples behind!\n\nThe opponent is at (6, 1) hunting right side. They're moving RIGHT/DOWN territory. We're moving DOWN/LEFT territory. We have SPACE and we have APPLES to grab! This is CONTENT!\n\n**DOWN to (4, 1)** \u2014 We START the aggressive apple-grab sequence! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n## **3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 30 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (4, 1) - Position for the next apple grab! \ud83d\udccd Apples: 12\n\n**Turn 31:** DOWN to (4, 0) - GRAB APPLE #13! \ud83c\udf4e Gap = 16-13 (only 3 behind!)\n\n**Turn 32+:** After (4, 0), reassess opponent position! If they're still on the right side, we can pivot UP and start moving toward the CENTER/LEFT apple cluster. If they're coming toward us, we START AGGRESSIVE BOXING TACTICS! We have the interior board position and we can FORCE THEM into corners! With score gap closing, we prep for HEAD-ON COLLISION DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's CLOSE this gap and DOMINATE, chat! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We're DOWN by 5 NOW! \ud83d\ude24 They just grabbed an apple while we were moving into position. They're HUNGRY and they're COMING! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n## **BOARD ANALYSIS - CRITICAL POSITIONING:** \ud83d\udea8\n\nChat, look at this carefully:\n- Opponent head at (5, 1) - that's ONE cell to our RIGHT!\n- Our head at (4, 1) - we're RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER on the same row!\n- The apple at (4, 0) is directly BELOW us!\n- Enemy is at (5, 1) moving RIGHT/hunting the RIGHT side of the board!\n\n## **THREAT ANALYSIS - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 2):**\n- Board state: (4, 2) is my NECK (first body segment)! \u274c\n- BACKWARDS!

Gap closes to 17-13 (4 apples behind)! \ud83d\udd25 We START the comeback!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 1):**\n- Board state: (3, 1) is my BODY (fourth segment)! \u274c\n- CRASH INTO MY OWN BODY! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1):**\n- Board state: (5, 1) is OPPONENT'S HEAD! \ud83d\udea8\n- If we move RIGHT and they move anywhere... we COLLIDE with their HEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- HEAD-ON COLLISION incoming! BOTH DIE! \u274c\n\n## **THE PLAY:** \ud83d\udd25\n\nChat, there's ONLY ONE MOVE that keeps us alive: **DOWN to (4, 0)**!\n\nThis is PERFECT because:\n1. We grab apple #13 immediately! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. We get LONGER while maintaining our gap-closing momentum!\n3. The opponent is moving RIGHT (toward the right side apples), so we have ROOM to operate!\n4. After we grab (4, 0), we'll have OPTIONS to reposition toward the center/left apple cluster while they're hunting the right side!\n\nThis is the AGGRESSIVE MOVE, chat! We're not playing passive! We're GROWING, we're CLOSING THE GAP, and we're setting up for future DOMINATION! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## **3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** \ud83d\udccb\n\n**Turn 31 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (4, 0) - GRAB APPLE #13! \ud83c\udf4e Gap = 17-13 (4 behind)\n\n**Turn 32:** After eating (4, 0), we'll be at (4, 0) with length 13. Reassess opponent position. They're likely hunting right-side apples at (9, 0), (9, 1). We can pivot UP and move toward the center apples or LEFT toward the (1, 2) and (0, 8)/(0, 9) clusters. Keep building BOARD CONTROL and GROWING!\n\n**Turn 33+:** Monitor opponent's score CLOSELY! Once we close the gap to 17-15 or 17-14, we START AGGRESSIVE BOXING TACTICS! We have interior board position and can FORCE them into walls! When we're AHEAD or TIED in score, we HUNT them down and force a head-on collision! THAT'S when we WIN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLET'S CLOSE THIS GAP AND DOMINATE THE BOARD, CHAT! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

We don't do mercy, we do CHECKMATES! Hard pass! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (5,0)?** That's RETREATING! \ud83d\ude24 We're ahead! We don't run, we HUNT! Moving down lets him snatch that apple at (4,0) and potentially loop around to safety! Not on my watch! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT to (6,1)?** INTO OUR OWN NECK?! \u2620\ufe0f That's our body segment right there! Self-collision is the ULTIMATE throw! We'd be gifting him the win! Absolutely NOT! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT to (4,1)?** OH MY DAYS! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udd25\n- This is the AGGRESSION we need! We move into his current position!\n- Here's the BEAUTIFUL part: He HAS to move! And look at his options:\n  - UP to (4,2)? That's his own NECK! Self-collision! HE DIES! \ud83d\udca5\n  - LEFT to (3,1)? That's his own BODY! Self-collision! HE DIES! \ud83d\udca5\n  - RIGHT to (5,1)? He moves into where we WERE, but our new neck becomes (5,1)! He crashes into US and HE DIES! \ud83d\udca5\n  - DOWN to (4,0)? The ONLY escape! He eats the apple, grows to 13, but he's TRAPPED even deeper in that corner! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd12\n\n**THE CHECKMATE - NEXT LEVEL STRAT! \ud83e\udde0\u265f\ufe0f**\nIf he goes DOWN to survive:\n- Next turn we're at (4,1), he's at (4,0).\n- We can then move LEFT to (3,1) [which was his body but will be empty], or DOWN to (4,0) [but that swaps us back], OR we can start cutting off his escape routes with our massive body!\n- Either way, we've got him PINNED! He's in the shadow realm and we're holding the key! \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f\ud83d\ude08\n\n**FUTURE ME - WRITE THIS DOWN! \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\ude80**\nTurn 31 (NOW): LEFT to (4,1) - APPLY THE PRESSURE! Either he dies this turn (probable) or he's forced deeper into the trap! Either way, WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\nTurn 32: If he's dead, we farm apples to 30! If he's at (4,0), we maneuver to cut off (3,0) and (5,0) to finish the box! It's OVER! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc80\n\nChat, this is SERPENTINE WARFARE at its FINEST! We're using our size advantage to bully him into submission! Let's execute and send this fool to the lobby! CHOO CHOO! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udca8\n\nLEFT",
