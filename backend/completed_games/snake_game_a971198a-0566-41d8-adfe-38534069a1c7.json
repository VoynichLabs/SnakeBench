          "rationale": "Let\u2019s evaluate my position after my previous move:\n\n**Current state:**\n- My head is now at (0, 7).\n- No body segments yet (not grown).\n- Just moved UP from (0, 6) to (0, 7).\n\n**Enemy positions:**\n- Snake #0 is at (4, 9) \u2014 top row, far from me (no immediate threat, not even close to column 0).\n- No snake bodies block my path (everyone's just a head).\n\n**Apples:**\n- (0, 8): Directly above me.\n- (0, 1): Far below in my column.\n- Other apples are far to the right.\n\n**Possible moves from (0, 7):**\n- UP: (0, 8) \u2014 contains an apple! I can eat and grow. No wall above until (0, 9), so safe.\n- DOWN: (0, 6) \u2014 safe, but moves away from the (0, 8) apple; not optimal.\n- RIGHT: (1, 7) \u2014 safe, opens options, but no apple that way, and column 1 is currently open.\n- LEFT: (\u20131, 7) \u2014 out of bounds; not allowed!\n\n**No imminent threat**:\n- Enemy far away.\n- Path to (0, 8) is clear.\n- Eating (0, 8) will grow my body for the first time.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Go UP to (0, 8), eat the apple, grow by one.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- After eating the apple (and growing to length 2), check new apple spawns (since the board may spawn one after I eat), and reevaluate the next closest apple.\n- (0, 1) is an option below me if no better opportunity appears, but may require navigating downward on the left edge safely.\n- Also watch for enemy heading left toward my side (unlikely next turn, but important to monitor).\n- Prioritize apples in my half of the board and avoid getting trapped near the outer walls.\n\n**My move:**  \n**UP**"
