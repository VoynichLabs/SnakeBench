The Enemy snake at `(7, 6)` is also 4 steps away from it. However, the Enemy is only 2 steps away from the apple at `(7, 4)`.

Both paths take 4 moves total.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** puts me at `(5, 7)`. This increases the Manhattan distance to the apple at `(0, 8)`.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** puts me at `(4, 8)`.

This minimizes collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving **LEFT** is the superior move. It is equally fast for the main target but significantly better for secondary targets and safety.\n\n**strategy**: Move LEFT to `(4, 8)` to align with the target apple at `(4, 5)` while keeping the option to switch to `(0, 8)` or `(2, 6)` open.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The body occupies `(2, 6)` and `(3, 6)`, with the tail currently at `(3, 5)`.\n2.  **Available Moves**:\n    *   **UP** (`1, 7`): Safe. Moving towards the top apple `(0, 8)` (distance 3).\n    *   **DOWN** (`1, 5`): Safe. Moving towards the bottom apple `(1, 3)` (distance 3). The tail at `(3, 5)` will move away, leaving row 5 clear near me.\n    *   **LEFT** (`0, 6`): Safe. Moves to the wall. From here, reaching `(0, 8)` takes 3 moves total. Reaching `(1, 3)` takes 4 moves total.\n    *   **RIGHT** (`2, 6`): **Unsafe**. Collision with own body.\n3.  **Strategic Decision**:\n    *   I have two equidistant targets: `(0, 8)` and `(1, 3)`. Both can be eaten in 3 moves.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis**: Snake 1 is at `(6, 5)` facing left. Its closest apple is `(6, 8)` at the top. It is highly probable the enemy will turn UP towards the top-right region.\n    *   **Area Control**:\n        *   The **Bottom** region contains `(1, 3)` and `(4, 0)`. These are far from the enemy and form a nice chain of defined targets.\n        *   The **Top** region contains `(0, 8)` and `(6, 8)`. The enemy is likely heading there. If I go for `(0, 8)`, I isolate myself at the top-left with fewer subsequent targets nearby, and closer to the enemy's potential path.\n    *   **Selection**: I will prioritize the bottom-left apple `(1, 3)`. It is safer, just as close, and sets up a better subsequent move towards `(4, 0)`. Moving DOWN is the most direct path.\n\n**Strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to `(1, 5)` to pursue the apple at `(1, 3)`.

The Enemy snake at `(7, 6)` is also 4 steps away from it. However, the Enemy is only 2 steps away from the apple at `(7, 4)`.

Both paths take 4 moves total.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** puts me at `(5, 7)`. This increases the Manhattan distance to the apple at `(0, 8)`.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** puts me at `(4, 8)`.

It is equally fast for the main target but significantly better for secondary targets and safety.\n\n**strategy**: Move LEFT to `(4, 8)` to align with the target apple at `(4, 5)` while keeping the option to switch to `(0, 8)` or `(2, 6)` open.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Reaching `(1, 3)` takes 4 moves total.\n    *   **RIGHT** (`2, 6`): **Unsafe**. Collision with own body.\n3.  **Strategic Decision**:\n    *   I have two equidistant targets: `(0, 8)` and `(1, 3)`. Both can be eaten in 3 moves.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis**: Snake 1 is at `(6, 5)` facing left. Its closest apple is `(6, 8)` at the top. It is highly probable the enemy will turn UP towards the top-right region.\n    *   **Area Control**:\n        *   The **Bottom** region contains `(1, 3)` and `(4, 0)`. These are far from the enemy and form a nice chain of defined targets.\n        *   The **Top** region contains `(0, 8)` and `(6, 8)`. The enemy is likely heading there. If I go for `(0, 8)`, I isolate myself at the top-left with fewer subsequent targets nearby, and closer to the enemy's potential path.\n    *   **Selection**: I will prioritize the bottom-left apple `(1, 3)`. It is safer, just as close, and sets up a better subsequent move towards `(4, 0)`. Moving DOWN is the most direct path.\n\n**Strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to `(1, 5)` to pursue the apple at `(1, 3)`. This separates me from the enemy snake operating on the right/top side and sets up a future path to the apple at `(4, 0)`.\n\nDOWN",

I just ate an apple in the previous turn, so my snake has grown (length 5). The tail at `(2, 6)` will likely remain effectively inplace or move to `(1, 6)` depending on growth resolution, but the immediate area around the head is the primary concern.\n2.  **Immediate Objective**: The apple at `(1, 3)` is consumed. The new closest targets are at `(2, 0)` (distance 4) and `(4, 0)` (distance 6).\n3.  **Move Options**:\n    *   **UP (1, 4)**: Blocked by my own body.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 3)**: Moves into open space. Distance to `(2, 0)` is 4 steps. Aligning to column 2 is good, but approaching the apple from the top `(2, 1) -> (2, 0)` requires a turn to get to the next apple at `(4, 0)`, potentially creating a \"U\" shape trap for myself.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3)**: Moves into a narrower column (column 0). Distance to `(2, 0)` increases slightly or remains inefficient. Only apple here is `(0, 8)` which is far.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 2)**: Moves towards the bottom wall. Distance to `(2, 0)` is 4 steps. This path `(1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0)` allows me to approach the apple along the wall. This is topologically superior because afterwards I can continue straight along the wall to `(4, 0)`, keeping my body pressed against the edge and leaving the center board open.\n4.  **Enemy Analysis**: Snake #1 is at `(5, 7)` and likely targeting the top-right apple at `(6, 8)`. Even if it targets `(4, 0)`, I am closer (6 steps vs ~8 steps) and will secure it first.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Moving **DOWN** is the safest and most strategic option to collect the sequence of apples at `(2, 0)` and `(4, 0)`.\n\n**Strategy**\nContinue moving **DOWN** to reach the bottom row `(y=0)`, then turn **RIGHT** to sweep up the apples at `(2, 0)` and `(4, 0)`.

It keeps both options open.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to `(6, 7)` reduces distance to `(4, 5)` but increases distance to `(0, 8)`.\n\n3.  **Strategy**:\n    Moving **LEFT** is superior because it optimizes the path to the entire cluster of apples on the left side (`(0, 8)`, `(4, 5)`, `(2, 6)`). It also keeps me further from the enemy snake, reducing collision risk while observing their next move. If the enemy aggressively pursues `(4, 5)`, I can easily pivot to `(0, 8)`.\n\n**strategy**: Move LEFT to `(5, 8)` to approach `(4, 5)` while keeping the safe `(0, 8)` apple as a backup.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Since the *next* closest apple is at `(1, 3)` (which is generally south), blocking `(2, 5)` forces the snake to go North or West after eating, taking a longer route to the next target.\n    *   **Path B (UP first)**: This path places the snake's body at `(3, 6)` when the head reaches `(2, 6)`. This leaves `(2, 5)` open. After eating the apple, the snake can immediately move DOWN towards `(1, 3)`.\n    *   Therefore, **Path B** is strategically superior for chaining apple consumptions.\n\n**Strategy**\nMove **UP** to `(3, 6)`. This positions the snake to eat the apple at `(2, 6)` on the following turn while keeping the path south (towards the next apple at `(1, 3)`) clear.\n\nUP",

I just ate an apple in the previous turn, so my snake has grown (length 5). The tail at `(2, 6)` will likely remain effectively inplace or move to `(1, 6)` depending on growth resolution, but the immediate area around the head is the primary concern.\n2.  **Immediate Objective**: The apple at `(1, 3)` is consumed. The new closest targets are at `(2, 0)` (distance 4) and `(4, 0)` (distance 6).\n3.  **Move Options**:\n    *   **UP (1, 4)**: Blocked by my own body.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 3)**: Moves into open space. Distance to `(2, 0)` is 4 steps. Aligning to column 2 is good, but approaching the apple from the top `(2, 1) -> (2, 0)` requires a turn to get to the next apple at `(4, 0)`, potentially creating a \"U\" shape trap for myself.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3)**: Moves into a narrower column (column 0). Distance to `(2, 0)` increases slightly or remains inefficient. Only apple here is `(0, 8)` which is far.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 2)**: Moves towards the bottom wall. Distance to `(2, 0)` is 4 steps. This path `(1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0)` allows me to approach the apple along the wall. This is topologically superior because afterwards I can continue straight along the wall to `(4, 0)`, keeping my body pressed against the edge and leaving the center board open.\n4.  **Enemy Analysis**: Snake #1 is at `(5, 7)` and likely targeting the top-right apple at `(6, 8)`. Even if it targets `(4, 0)`, I am closer (6 steps vs ~8 steps) and will secure it first.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Moving **DOWN** is the safest and most strategic option to collect the sequence of apples at `(2, 0)` and `(4, 0)`.\n\n**Strategy**\nContinue moving **DOWN** to reach the bottom row `(y=0)`, then turn **RIGHT** to sweep up the apples at `(2, 0)` and `(4, 0)`.

Distance to `(2, 0)` increases slightly or remains inefficient. Only apple here is `(0, 8)` which is far.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 2)**: Moves towards the bottom wall. Distance to `(2, 0)` is 4 steps.

Reaching `(1, 3)` takes 4 moves total.\n    *   **RIGHT** (`2, 6`): **Unsafe**. Collision with own body.\n3.  **Strategic Decision**:\n    *   I have two equidistant targets: `(0, 8)` and `(1, 3)`. Both can be eaten in 3 moves.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis**: Snake 1 is at `(6, 5)` facing left. Its closest apple is `(6, 8)` at the top. It is highly probable the enemy will turn UP towards the top-right region.\n    *   **Area Control**:\n        *   The **Bottom** region contains `(1, 3)` and `(4, 0)`. These are far from the enemy and form a nice chain of defined targets.\n        *   The **Top** region contains `(0, 8)` and `(6, 8)`. The enemy is likely heading there. If I go for `(0, 8)`, I isolate myself at the top-left with fewer subsequent targets nearby, and closer to the enemy's potential path.\n    *   **Selection**: I will prioritize the bottom-left apple `(1, 3)`. It is safer, just as close, and sets up a better subsequent move towards `(4, 0)`. Moving DOWN is the most direct path.\n\n**Strategy**\nMove **DOWN** to `(1, 5)` to pursue the apple at `(1, 3)`. This separates me from the enemy snake operating on the right/top side and sets up a future path to the apple at `(4, 0)`.\n\nDOWN",
