The enemy snake is at (6, 1) with its body at (6, 0).\n\nLet's evaluate the best move:\n\n- **UP**: Moving up to (5, 8) will allow me to eat the apple and gain a point. This is the closest and most direct move to an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down to (5, 6) takes me away from the apples at (5, 8) and (4, 7) and closer to the bottom wall, which is not a strategic move.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left to (4, 7) will also allow me to eat the apple at (4, 7). This move is also strategic, but it's slightly less direct compared to moving up.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right to (6, 7) takes me away from the nearest apples and closer to the right wall, which is not a good move.\n\nThe best move is to move **UP** to (5, 8) where there is an apple. This will allow my snake to grow and gain a point. After eating this apple, I should plan to move towards the next closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake and avoiding the walls.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (5, 8), I will move towards the apple at (4, 7) or (8, 6), depending on the board state and the position of the enemy snake. I will also maintain a safe distance from the walls and the enemy snake to avoid any risky moves.\n\nMy next move: UP"
