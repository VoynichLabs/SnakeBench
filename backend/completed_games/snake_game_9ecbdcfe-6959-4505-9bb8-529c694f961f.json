No immediate death here. My mistake.)\n   - UP \u2192 (8,8) is occupied by Snake #0's head at (0,8)? No, Snake #0's head is at (0,8), so (8,8) is empty. Safe.\n   - DOWN \u2192 (8,6) is empty (board shows '.' at (8,6)). Safe.\n   - LEFT \u2192 (7,7) is empty (board shows '.' at (7,7)). Safe.\n\n   Correction: All four moves are on the board and do not hit any snake body (no bodies exist yet). So all four are safe for now.\n\n3) Now I consider the enemy snake's possible moves. Snake #0 is at (0,8). Its possible moves:\n   - UP \u2192 (0,9) (safe)\n   - DOWN \u2192 (0,7) (safe)\n   - LEFT \u2192 (-1,8) (off board, dies)\n   - RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) (safe)\n\n   So Snake #0 will likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT to stay alive.\n\n4) I assess the risk of head-on collisions:\n   - If I move UP to (8,8), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1,8), no collision.\n   - If I move UP to (8,8), and Snake #0 moves UP to (0,9), no collision.\n   - If I move UP to (8,8), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0,7), no collision.\n   - No direct head-on collision risk with UP.\n\n   Similarly for other moves, no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n5) I look at apple positions:\n   - (3,2), (6,6), (1,8), (8,4), (7,6)\n   - Closest apples to me (8,7) are (8,4) (distance 3), (7,6) (distance ~1.4), (6,6) (distance ~2.2).\n   - (7,6) is the closest apple.\n\n6) I consider moves toward (7,6):\n   - LEFT to (7,7) is one step closer to (7,6) (then DOWN to (7,6)).\n   - DOWN to (8,6) is also closer to (7,6) (then LEFT to (7,6)).\n\n7) I check future options after each move:\n   - If I move LEFT to (7,7), next turn I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (all open).\n   - If I move DOWN to (8,6), next turn I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (all open).\n   - Both moves keep options open.\n\n8) I prefer LEFT to (7,7) because it is directly toward the closest apple (7,6) and keeps the path open.\n\nLong-term plan: Move toward the closest apple at (7,6) while maintaining flexibility. After eating, reassess the next closest apple and avoid tight spaces.\n\nLEFT",

(4,9) and (6,2) are somewhat reachable, but (6,2) risks enemy interference; (8,4) and (3,2) offer peripheral paths.

I just moved LEFT last turn from (2,5).\n- Enemy: Head (2,3), body [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)].\n- Board apples: Assuming the board accurately shows them (including apparent A at (0,5) despite list omission), so (1,1), (0,4), (6,9), (0,9), (8,5), and (0,5).\n- Safe moves from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) empty, LEFT (0,5) onto apple, RIGHT (2,5) into my own body (suicide).\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP to (1,6)**: Safe, gives space but forces Y-nav (only secure LEFT or UP next without loops/backtracks). Closer to (6,9) long-term, but I have no clear path avoiding enemy blocks at x=3-6. Tighter than ideal; enemy could pivot toward x=1-2 if they detect.\n- **DOWN to (1,4)**: Safe, but puts me closer to enemy at y=3-4, risking head-on if they go UP to (2,4). Sets up LEFT to (0,4) for a quick eat, but RIGHT options might loop me near enemy tail at (3,3), limiting space.\n- **LEFT to (0,5)**: Safe, and moves directly onto an apple (grow + point). Opens x=0 column with multiple apples ((0,4), (0,9) below me), free of enemy influence. Future: DOWN-seq toward (0,4) etc., wide escape options (UP/DOWN along x=0). Avoids enemy threats at x=2-6; promotes safe chaining. Also sidesteps potential enemy rightward pushes toward (8,5).\n- **RIGHT**: Suicide into own body.\n\nLEFT maximizes short-term apple gain (immediate eat), keeps options open in low-risk x=0, and sticks to last plan's LEFT-shifting logic for zig-zag to (1,1)/(0,4). Prioritize eating over conservative space alone.\n\n**Plan/Strategy Note for Next Turns:** At (0,5), just ate an apple\u2014immediately DOWN to (0,4) for another eat if safe (check enemy doesn't block/crash y=3-4). From (0,4), zig-zag DOWN/LEFT (e.g., DOWN to (0,3), then LEFT to (1,3) or stay x=0 toward (0,0) for floor access) toward (1,1). Watch enemy\u2014if they head LEFT/RIGHT into x=1-4, dodge DOWN to x=0 or loop RIGHT back to x=2. Outpace with 4-6 more apples; aim for (1,1) chain then LEFT swerve to (8,5) if needs empty. Avoid x=3 until tail clears (50 apples cap incoming).\n\nLEFT",

Closer to (0,9) apple in the long term via x=0 column. Avoids potential enemy aggression if they push right/up toward central apples, but I defer eating an immediate apple, potentially slower score gain.\n- **DOWN to (0,4)**: Safe and moves onto apple for instant growth (+1 segment/point). Continues low-risk x=0 strategy for chaining apples ((0,4) then possibly toward (0,0) or (0,9)). Keeps follow-up options: RIGHT into empty x=1 for zig-zag toward (1,1), or continue down. No immediate enemy head threat (enemy can't reach (0,4) this turn; any moves are away). Prioritizes eating over spacing alone, matches prior plan to eat (0,4) next.\n\n**Plan/Strategy Note for Next Turns:** After DOWN to (0,4) and eating (+apple), snake grows. Immediately continue strategy: if (1,4) is empty (check enemy doesn't crash there), zig-zag RIGHT to (1,4) then DOWN to (1,3) or LEFT to avoid enemy tail at (3,3); otherwise stay x=0 DOWN toward (0,0) for board control.

However, this risks enemy interception if they move LEFT toward y=2, possibly leading to head-on collisions or cutting off routes.\n\nRIGHT to (1,4) aligns with the previous plan to zig-zag RIGHT and pursue higher-ground apples while avoiding enemy-occupied areas. This move opens paths to maneuver rightward (e.g., toward (8,5)) without immediate head-on risks, and enemy movement options (likely eating apples at (1,1) or (2,2)) shouldn't threaten in the next turn. It also prevents getting trapped in the low x=0 column like DOWN would.\n\nContinuing the zig-zag: after RIGHT to (1,4), move RIGHT to (2,4) (only safe option), then RIGHT again to (3,4). From there, avoid conflict with enemy bodies/tails by continuing RIGHT toward (4,4+), monitoring for turns to eat (8,5) or other apples. Watch enemy position\u2014 if they approach high y quickly via apples, readjust leftward if needed. Stay clear of x=3-5 until snake recedes.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT to (3,7) starts direct, low-risk path to eat (1,7), grow to 8, avoid enemy low x and tight highs. UP good for flexibility/access to (6,9), but LEFT consistent with prior strategy to eat (1,7) for quick growth.

LEFT keeps pursual of quick growth (1,7) aligned with prior plan, maintains open row 7 for flexibility (UP/DOWN options). UP good for high-board access but delays apple eat; DOWN moves into tightening y=5-6 body zone, fewer futures if enemy closes x=0 gap.

Enemy head at (1,3) is distant, but simultaneous moves mean potential head-on if we collide this turn (e.g., I LEFT, they UP to (1,4)? unlikely immediate, but track). Closest apple at (1,7) via LEFT; eating grows to 8 segments, opens post-eat options like UP to (1,8) for y=9 apple pursuit ((0,9)/(6,9)). Other apples: (0,9)/(6,9) on top row, (8,5)/(7,1) in lower/mid. UP keeps high board open but skips immediate eat; DOWN to (2,6) descends toward cluttered body zone (my own at y=4-5, enemy at x=0-2 y=0-2), limits future paths if enemy rises. Prioritize LEFT for quick growth, aligns with last plan's (1,7) eat then (1,8) pivot. No obvious traps; left route stays open with multiple exits (UP, DOWN from new head).\n\n**Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nJust ate (1,7), now at (1,7) with 7 apples (vs enemy 8), body length 8.

Favor UP for high ground/top access without committing edge, maximizes future flexibility; DOWN's growth tempting but earnest last time I ate low, ditched by self-body; enemy might flank x=0 if I LEFT.\n\nSafe options rank: UP (strong, strategical), LEFT (decent), then DOWN (quickness but risky trap).\n\n**Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nUP to (1,8) for middle perch, wide options: LEFT to (0,8) to chase (0,9 apple) quickly (2 total: LEFT then UP), or RIGHT to (2,8) to survey mid-board/space (delays edgechase but hedges vs. enemy rising); avoid DOWN if enemy pushes high y to block or crowd. Post-(0,9) eat (at (0,9)), dodge left edge-wall, pivot RIGHT to (1,9) or DOWN careful. Watch enemy (they at y=4)-if no UP moves, push for apple lead; if they ascend x=1, digress to y=6 or x-parts.

DOWN to (0,7), which is free, no immediate threats.\n\nEliminating kills: LEFT and RIGHT die, so UP and DOWN safe.\n\nEvaluating:\n\n- UP: Eats apple at (0,9) in 1 move, ties scores at 8, fulfills last plan. Post-eat, head at (0,9) (edge), only RIGHT to (1,9) safe. From there, opens upward access to (6,9) or mid-board escapes without early edge traps. Keeps distance from long enemy body near y=0-6; enemy likely LEFT to eat (0,6) for easy 9, but we secure 8 safely. Commitments: stuck to left x=0-1 edge for now, but plan allows pivoting right or down cautiously.\n\n- DOWN: To (0,7), closer to (0,6) apple, but post-move only DOWN safe (to eat (0,6) next turn), limiting options to vertical path along x=0, risking low-board clutter near enemy body at y=3-0. Slower eat (2 moves to apple vs. 1 for UP), and if enemy takes (0,6) this turn (probable LEFT), we get nothing while lagging. Avoids edge commit but traps faster if enemy adjusts.\n\nUP best: Direct eat to tie/lead, aligns with strategy, prevents starvation threats, opens flexible mid-board routes after pivot. Prioritizes apples while dodging enemy near-rise (their HEAD wouldn't threaten y=9 if LEFT-eating).\n\n**Strategy Note to Future Self:**\nAfter eat at (0,9), head at (1,9) post-RIGHT pivot (only safe from edge). Chase (6,9) by RIGHT-path (e.g., RIGHT to (2,9), etc., up to (6,9) if clear), but avoid x>7 traps toward (8,5); if enemy LEFT-eats (0,6) to 9, I at 8, need to close via upper loops or safe pivots. Watch enemy head post-eat (likely at (0,6) or (2,6)); if they stay low, capitalize on y=9 row for (6,9); else, redirect DOWN carefully from (1,9) toward (8,5) or (7,1) without self-hits.
