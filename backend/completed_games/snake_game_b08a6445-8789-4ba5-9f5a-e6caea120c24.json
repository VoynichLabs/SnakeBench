I also don't want to go backwards, so I'll try to move up towards the apple.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to move up towards the apple at (0, 4) and see if I can get to it safely.\n\nNext move: UP"

(The apple at (0,4) is equally distant but on the left, where the enemy\u2019s snake at (1,9) is lurking near; hence, it seems safer to head toward the apple on the right.) None of our immediate moves put us at risk of hitting a wall or an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best step is to move UP.\n\nNext move: UP."
