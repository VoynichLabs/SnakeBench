I'm closest to the apple at (3, 7), so my initial thought is to head towards that apple.\n\nHowever, I also notice that Snake #1 is at position (9, 0) and is quite far from me, so I don't think I need to worry about it for now. My main priority is to get to that apple at (3, 7).\n\nTo get to the apple, I need to move up and then right. Since I'm currently at (1, 7), moving up would bring me to (1, 6), and then moving right would bring me to (2, 7), which is closer to the apple.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to head towards the apple at (3, 7) and try to get as close as possible.\n\nMy decided next move is: UP."
