These apples are to the right and downward from my current position.\n\nEnemy snake positions:\n- Snake #2 at (4,6). It's positioned slightly above and to the right of me and might be heading toward the same apple cluster. Potential risk of competition.\n\nEvaluating movement options:\n- Continuing RIGHT is still beneficial, closing horizontal gap towards the apples. It moves my snake unobstructed closer towards apples.\n- Moving DOWN could position me closer vertically towards apples, but due to enemy snake at (4,6), it might allow a safer tactical route if I first get horizontally closer.\n- Moving UP or LEFT isn't beneficial. Up takes me away from the apples and left risks collision with my own body segment at (1,5).\n\nContinued strategic recommendation for future turns:\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake #2 and its direction, avoid collision.\n- Keep moving RIGHT until I can more directly move downward towards apples cluster.\n- Ensure I navigate safely and efficiently toward apples.\n\nBased on the evaluation and continued strategic options:\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
