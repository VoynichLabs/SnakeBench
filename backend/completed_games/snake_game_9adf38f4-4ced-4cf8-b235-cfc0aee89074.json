The enemy snake at (5,2) is far away and unlikely to collide head-on this turn unless we both head towards the same cell, but none of my moves do that.\n\nEvaluating the four options per the decision process:\n- Among safe moves, prioritize those increasing apple-eating chances while keeping future options open and avoiding potential traps or dead ends.\n  - **RIGHT to (9,7)**: Puts me at the board edge quickly, limiting future safe moves (only LEFT back or UP/DOWN, with DOWN potentially risky later). This doesn't move me toward any apples (all apples are at x=2-5 vs. my x=8+), reduces options, and feels like a dead-end. Pass.\n  - **DOWN to (8,6)**: Opens some paths but moves me down/y-, away from most apples (e.g., the cluster around x=2-5, y=1-5 and the lone (5,9)). It keeps options decent but doesn't improve apple access. Pass for now.\n  - **UP to (8,8)**: Moves slightly closer to the (5,9) apple (distance reduces from ~3.6 to ~3.16 units) and remains in open space with good options. However, it's not the closest to the main apple cluster.\n  - **LEFT to (7,7)**: Moves me left/x- toward the main apple cluster ((2,5), (3,1), (4,2), (5,1) at x=2-5). Distance to, say, (5,9) reduces from ~3.6 to ~2.8 units, and it positions me to continue left (to x=6,7) in future turns for even closer access. Keeps plenty of open space and follow-up moves (UP(7,8), DOWN(7,6), LEFT(6,7)\u2014with RIGHT back being safe and non-clogging initially). This improves apple proximity without limiting options or risking corners.\n\nLEFT stands out as the safest and most strategic. It moves me toward reachable apples (especially the three at y=1-2, x=3-5), keeps multiple safe future moves available, avoids edges/dead spots, and dodges any likely head-on collisions this turn.\n\n**Short-term plan for next few turns**: Continue moving LEFT/leftward toward the x=4-5 apples (e.g., (4,2) or (5,1)) while avoiding the enemy snake's possible path down from (5,2). If I reach (5,1) before enemy, eat it. Monitor for collisions and space; pivot UP or DOWN if paths close off.\n\nLEFT",

Weak option.\n  - **DOWN to (7,6)**: Moves me down/y- into slightly more open space but away from the nearest apples ((5,9) ~2.8 units, (0,7) 7 left). It keeps options decent (e.g., could LEFT later) but doesn't strategically position me closer to reachable apples.

It's comparable to LEFT in proximity but edges me slightly higher, potentially distancing from lower apples.\n  - **LEFT to (6,7)**: Moves me further left/x- towards the main apple cluster ((0,7) 6 left, (5,9) ~2.23 units closer) and the lower cluster ((5,1), (3,1)). Distance to (5,9) drops from ~2.83 to ~2.23, positioning me for continued leftward progress (e.g., next LEFT to (5,7)).

Keeps solid options (can pivot left/right/down to open areas), though slightly edges me higher, distancing a bit from y=1 apples. Strong aggressive choice, but per last rationale, prioritizes keeping y middle for balance.\n- **LEFT to (5,7)**: Progresses x left directly toward x=5 apple cluster ((5,9), (5,1)), matching last plan to position for (5,7) UP (5,8) UP (5,9).

Monitor if enemy eats (3,1) next turn\u2014could necessitate y downward pivot.\n\n**Short-term plan for next few turns**: Continue LEFT/leftward to x=5: next LEFT?

Strong for flexible apple pursuit without rushing into tight spots.\n\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Points toward lower apples like (5,1) but adds distance to (5,9) (~3.6 vs. 2.0). Decent space but less immediate progress; might pigeonhole toward y=1 if enemy pressures.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,7)**: Away from x=5 apples cluster, increasing distance to (5,9) (~3.0).

LEFT to (3,7) - directly into my own body, invalid/suicide.\n- No immediate collision risks; enemy is at bottom-right, moving toward possible (9,5) apple or upward/downward, no overlap with my safe cells this turn.\n- Apples: Eating (5,7) immediately boosts me to 3 apples (enemy at 4). Position favors continuing right-ish to explore more (e.g., (9,5) or others). Other moves (UP, DOWN) move away from this apple without eating, reducing my edge.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Eats apple instantly, increases score and length safely. At (5,7), follow-ups: UP to (5,8) - clear board above. DOWN to (5,6) - toward (9,5) apple area and avoids walls. RIGHT to (6,7) - central movement, options to loop or chase. Avoids trapping (board open right-center), keeps centrality for apple access over edges. Matches last turn's right momentum, efficient for closing the score gap.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Moves downward into emptier lower board, no immediate apple, potential to reach (2,5) but circuitous. Follow-ups at (4,6): DOWN (4,5), RIGHT (5,6), UP (back to 4,7 own body). Less direct than RIGHT, commits to less apple-dense areas, higher trap risk if enemy pushes central.\n- UP to (4,8): Shifts upward into mostly open space but few nearby apples (distant (9,5) or backtracks). Follow-ups: RIGHT (5,8), UP (4,9 near top edge), DOWN (4,7 own body), LEFT (3,8). High options but deviates from apple-rich right-center, less efficient than RIGHT for eating next.\n\nRIGHT best for immediate apple gain and flexible positioning, avoiding dead-ends while anticipating enemy mid-board movement.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** After eating (5,7), assess proximity to (9,5) apple\u2014consider DOWN or RIGHT to chase it if safe, or pivot UP/LEFT to flank enemy. Prioritize eating more apples centrally while monitoring enemy (longer snake, aggressive to (9,5)). Stay mid-board to avoid walls/edges, preempt head-ons by assuming enemy moves toward apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Other apples less accessible soon\u2014(0,7) blocked by own body, (2,5) needs more circuitous path.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- DOWN to (5,6): Positions toward (2,6) apple efficiently (potential eat in 3 turns), keeps mid-board centrality, multiple follow-ups (LEFT to (4,6) empty, RIGHT to (6,6) empty, UP/back to (5,7) if needed, DOWN to (5,5) open). Avoids traps (board open down/left), avoids edges/walls (opposite of enemy cornered). Immediate open options surpass alternatives; prioritizes apple proximity over distant RIGHT or isolated UP.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Moves deeper mid-board, good centrality, but fewer near-term apples (harder path to (2,6) or others without backtracking), reduced apple access vs DOWN. Follow-ups ok (RIGHT (7,7), DOWN (6,6) toward (2,6), UP (6,8)), but less direct apple boost.\n- UP to (5,8): Shifts to open top space, many options (RIGHT (6,8), LEFT (4,8), UP (5,9) edge, DOWN back), but fewer nearby apples, commits upper edge (potential trap if enemy pushes up), less efficient for eating vs DOWN.\n\nDOWN best for apple pursuit, flexibility, and avoiding dead-ends while positioning against enemy (monitor right-edge movement).\n\n**Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** Collect (2,6) apple via DOWN then LEFTs if safe, growing to length 5.

Enemy head at (8,7), far away, unlikely to directly threaten this turn (possible moves UP to (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7)); no head-on risks, and all apples reachable via LEFT path.\n- Apples: (2,6) directly adjacent LEFT for guaranteed eat (length 4\u21925, score 3\u21924). (2,5) below it post-eat for chain potential. Other apples farther; enemy snakeside but slow to cluster (5 apples vs my 3). No off-board, self, or enemy body collisions in safe moves.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- UP to (3,7): Keeps me in mid-board (wiggle to (3,8) later, DOWN/LEFT still open), defends against vertical enemy incursions if they shift left. But stalls apple progress\u2014would need LEFT next to reach (2,6) anyway, potentially allowing enemy to close on (8,0).\n- DOWN to (3,5): Opens south for (0,4) later, stalls less than UP but still delays LEFT path, risks tighter space if enemy follows south. Flexibility decent but suboptimal for immediate growth.\n- LEFT to (2,6): Eats apple instantly, boosts score (3\u21924 vs enemy 5), grows length for better control/future baiting. Preserves horiz/vert escapes (post-eat DOWN/LEFT safe), continues aggressive plan without cornering. Strongest for survival/growth balance, no traps evident.\n\nLEFT best: Eats key apple as per plan, maintains open board access vs. defensive drifts. Enemy won't block soon.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** From (2,6) after eating (grow to length 5), go DOWN to (2,5) for instant chain-eat apple (grow to 6, score to 5). Post that from (2,5), go DOWN to (2,4) toward (0,4) apple; avoid right side where enemy tail expands (x=7-8,y=5-7). Use growth to flank left, aim for 6-7 apples lead to outpace enemy on (8,0)/(0,7).

Their body is oriented southward (towards lower y), with safe moves including LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4), or DOWN to (6,3) (directly into the apple at (5,3), but wait\u2014apples are at (5,3), not (6,3); row 3 has apple at pos6? Wait, apples listed as (5,3), and board shows A at row3 pos6? Row3: \". . . . . A . . . .\" so pos5 is A, which is (5,3). Misread; DOWN for them is (6,3) empty. But they could RIGHT to (7,4), then potentially path to (7,6) or (7,9) apples. No immediate risk to me; I'm far left, they seem mid-board.\n- Other apples: (0,7) is 3 UP from me, reachable next turn (to (0,5), then (0,6), then (0,7) to eat for score 7 and potential grow). The (7,6) or (7,9) are closer to enemy; (5,3) and (8,0) are alternatives if needed, but sticking to left edge avoids crowding.\n- Board threats: No head-on collisions likely this turn. Enemy can't directly threaten x=0 quickly. My snake isn't near walls or self-traps beyond the known backwards rule (avoid reversing if possible, but DOWN from (0,5) back to (0,4) might be risky/backwards even if \"empty\"\u2014UP avoids that).\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- UP to (0,5): Opens path straight to (0,7) apple via (0,6) next turn. Keeps multiple options: from (0,5), I can go RIGHT (1,5) empty for flexibility or continue UP. Directly advances scoring without detours. Prioritizes eating soon while staying on safe left edge away from enemy. Follow-ups: RIGHT (1,5) and UP (0,6); possibly LEFT off-board; no backwards issue.\n- DOWN to (0,3): Moves southward, farther from the near apple (0,7). Keeps options (could go RIGHT[I to (1,3) empty or UP back to (0,4)], but is more of a neutral/fallback shift with 2-3 follow-ups. Delays progress and doesn't directly help eating (0,7) is harder to reach later if I overcommit south). Worse than UP for scoring momentum.\n\nUP best: Closes on immediate apple, maintains open space on edge, low risk (enemy distant, no traps). Favors growth and strategy over conservative but slower juggling.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** Continue UP to (0,5) this turn for progress toward (0,7); next turn UP to (0,6); follow with UP to (0,7) to eat, grow, and gain 7 apples for lead (they at 6). Monitor enemy\u2014if they eat (5,3) or head east, stick to left edge for (0,7) first, then pivot right mid-board for (7,6) or (7,9) if safe/unblocked (e.g., via RIGHT braches). Avoid backward moves to prevent self-risk; keep 2+ options per turn. If enemy grows threatening, consider circling around if needed.\n\nUP",

Enemy can't block easily.\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): Empty, but traps quickly (only UP to (1, 6) next; RIGHT/DOWN into own body). Sidesteps apple progress and shrinks future moves, worse than UP.\n\nUP best: Directly advances apple eat, maximizes future flexibility, low risk (distant enemy, no dead ends).\n\n**Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** UP to (0, 6), then UP to (0, 7) to eat (+1 apple, grow, lead to 7). After eating, from (0, 7) new head: RIGHT to (1, 7) to explore mid-board or DOWN toward bottom (avoid LEFT off). Watch enemy path (if they eat (5, 3) or shift east, loop right for (7, 6)/(7, 9) if clear; else defend edge). Prioritize non-backwards moves, 2+ options/turn, score quickly to 10+ before enemy closes.\n\nUP",

No risks from enemy head (7, 5); their safe options are UP to (7, 6) (apple) or RIGHT to (8, 5). If they go UP, heads won't collide; if RIGHT, same. No head-on threat.\n- Apples: (0, 7) reachable immediately via UP, leading to +1 apple this turn (tied/leading vs. enemy). Other apples (8, 0), (5, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9) require multiple moves; (7, 6) likely enemy priority.\n- Board threats: None immediate.

No traps; low enemy interference.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- UP to (0, 7): Directly eats (0, 7), scores +1 (7 apples), grows body (now 7 segments), maintains edge momentum. Future: 2+ safe options (UP/RIGHT), advances board exploration/apples without closure risk. Enemy distant; no backwards/backtrack issues.\n- RIGHT to (1, 6): Empty, but limits to mostly UP only next (RIGHT/DOWN body), stalls apple progress (far from others), potentially boxes in vs. UP's flexibility.

Prioritize non-dead ends, watch enemy for blocks (e.g., if they go RIGHT from (7, 5) toward (8, 0)/(5, 3), top safer; UP if they eat north, might contest). Score lead by turn ~28-30 probably.\n\nUP",

UP positions me for top-row traversal toward (7, 9) in future turns; RIGHT moves me slightly inward but stalls progress toward distant apples, with fewer long-term options compared to staying on the edge.\n- Board threats: Limited enemy activity; their forced RIGHT move leaves the top and left open. No traps or dead-ends in the board's left/top quadrants yet.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- UP to (0, 8): Empty spot on the left edge, frees the left column for future EXIT moves if needed, and opens the top row (full of empty space from (0, 9) rightward) for easy traversal. Builds toward apples like (7, 9) without restricting options (next turn: UP to (0, 9) or RIGHT to (1, 8) both safe).

Worse for long-term apple access/scoring (stalls rather than advances) and risks subtle boxing-in vs. UP's edge advantage.\n\nUP best: Maximizes board openness, preserves multiple future options, advances toward top apples without immediate risk or closure. Enemy's current path isolates them from contesting the top/left effectively yet.\n\n### Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns\nHead now at (0, 8) after this UP move.

From (0, 9), traverse RIGHT:hovering toward (7, 9) while keeping escapes (e.g., DOWN if pressured, but top is freer).

Neither move creates an immediate trap, and both keep escape options open.\n- Strategy: Favor moves that approach the nearest apple while preserving flexibility. UP positions you to potentially eat the apple at (7,9) next turn if safe, and it maintains multiple safe follow-up options.\n\nLong-term plan note (for next turns):\n- Primary target: apple at (7,9). If safe, continue moving UP to reach it in two turns.\n- If the apple is captured by another snake or path becomes blocked, reassess to chase other nearby apples (e.g., (5,3) or (9,1)) while avoiding tight corridors near your own body.\n- Always avoid turning into your own neck or attempting risky head-on collisions with enemy heads unless it clearly reduces risk and gains an apple.\n\nUP",

RIGHT keeps 3 follow-up options vs. UP's 1 (then 2 immediate branches), better for adaptability.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\nUP to (0,9): Commits to top row early, allows eventual traversal RIGHT towards (7,9) in 6 additional moves, but bottlenecks at (0,9) to only RIGHT next, reducing responsiveness if enemy contests top. Less flexible than desired for score chasing.\n\nRIGHT to (1,8): Positions for a UP next turn to top row (like UP from start), while preserving DOWN towards potential mid-board plays or RIGHT for row 8 crossing if pivoting to (9,1). Avoids forced narrowing; row 8 open across 9 cells, enabling downstream escapes or long swings. Minimizes self-trap risks compared to UP's corner lock-in.\n\nRIGHT preferred: Maximizes immediate options without closing paths, aligns with exploration towards clustered top-right apples, hedges against enemy feints.\n\n### Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns\nHead now at (1,8) after RIGHT. Next turn: UP to (1,9) to access top row, preserving open rightward traversal toward (7,9) if unguarded by enemy\u2014expect 6-7 moves to reach after initial RIGHTs, but pivot early if enemy challenges (e.g., stay row9 and shift RIGHT more aggressively or DOWN to (1,8) for row8 plan). If enemy vacates top, secure (7,9) by T32-35; else, detour via RIGHT across row8 to col9, DOWN to (9,1) for guaranteed eat in ~17 moves total, avoiding competition. Prioritize options openness over immediate max distance; aim to surpass enemy to 9-10 apples by T40 via top accesses, adjusting if they block south/mid.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT forbidden (backwards into own body at (0,8)).\n- Enemy safe moves: UP (7,9, into apple), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). DOWN forbidden (into own body at (7,7)).\n- Apple prioritization: (7,9) remains at high priority; enemy can reach it in 1 move (UP), potentially gaining apple 8. Other apples: (8,0), (2,0) bottom blocked by my tail, (9,1) accessible via top row traversal or extended right from y=8, (5,3) mid-board. Urgency on (7,9) if enemy doesn't contest; otherwise, pivot to (9,1) via top row or (5,3) if safer.\n- Board threats: Top row (y=9) mostly open for rapid traversal; enemy control mid-right (x=6-7); stayed y<8 avoids conflicts but risks missing top apple. No immediate self-traps, but committing UP advances high-risk play.\n\n### Rationale Among Safe Moves\n- UP to (1,9): Aligns with last plan to access top row, positioning for RIGHTward chase to (7,9) in ~5-6 moves if uncontested (enemy head-on risk low unless they also flood top), while keeping full rightward escape and downgrade options. Maximizes flexibility for next turn pivots and hedges against enemy blocking lower paths.\n- RIGHT to (2,8): Extends along y=8 (open to x8), good for gradual top access (UP afterward) or pressing toward x9 for (9,1) in ~8 moves downward, but delays (7,9) urgency if enemy takes it\u2014less aggressive for lead-building.\n- DOWN to (1,7): Drops toward mid-board, enabling LEFT toward my left arc or RIGHT for (9,1) via long swing, but adds turns to any target (e.g., (5,3) in ~4-5), reduces responsiveness if enemy secures top\u2014a safe retreat but suboptimal for apple gains.\n\nUP preferred: Follows prior plan for proactive top-segment exploration, keeps 3 follow-up options (RIGHT/LEFT/DOWN), directly competes on (7,9) trajectory while minimizing bottleneck risks.\n\n### Long-term plan for next 2-3 turns\nHead now at (1,9) after UP. Next turn: RIGHT to (2,9) to traverse top open space, monitor enemy\u2014flip to DOWN if they UP to (7,9) and contest top aggressively (e.g., via RIGHT to x9 y9, then DOWN for (9,1) in 7-8 more). If top yields (7,9), pursue directly to ~5 moves; else, swing to mid-via RIGHT/LEFT for (5,3) or bottom apples. Aim for 8-9 apples by T35-40, surpassing enemy by outflanking south if needed.enci\u00f3n Prioritize options over max distance; adjust if enemy heads west/south.\n\nUP",

Continuing DOWN advances this efficiently, bringing me closer to gaining my 8th apple and tying or taking the lead (currently 7 vs. their 8), while keeping the entire apple-grabbing path wide open with multiple future moves (still can turn left/right freely later or loop back).\n- LEFT opens exploration towards column 1 (largely unblocked below) or potentially circling to other apples, with options to turn back into column 2 or venture wider, but it deviates from the immediate apple at (2,0) without clear nearby gains and risks meandering into tighter spaces sooner compared to straight down.\n- RIGHT allows progressing towards the grouped apples at (5,3) and (6,3) in row 3 by heading east, with space to maneuver in columns 3-4, but getting there requires detouring down then east (e.g., via 4,5 or so), which feels less efficient for an immediate score boost and is farther than the (2,0) path. The vertical path to (2,0) remains tempting for low-risk progress.\n\nThe enemy snake (head at 9,7) has no immediate break towards my position\u2014their possible moves (DOWN or LEFT) target their own right-side area, with no head-on collision risks for my DOWN or other safe moves this turn, based on simultaneous timing. They might aim at their nearby (6,3) or (9,1), but blocking isn't necessary yet; chasing my (2,0) safely eats into their lead.\n\nPrioritizing the direct, safe, and high-scoring move, I'll stick with DOWN to maintain momentum. Future self: After eating (2,0) (likely in 6 turns), assess the remaining apples\u2014(5,3)/(6,3) could be a pivot east via column 3+ if enemy heads there, or explore west/left for (8,0) or looping; avoid corners and keep flexibility for tight escapes.\n\nDOWN",

Remaining apples are at (8,0), (2,0), (9,1), (0,5)\u2014all still reachable in theory, but mobility is limited. My own snake's body blocks downward movement below y=6 (due to own segments at y=5 in columns 2-5), and enemy bodies block columns 8+ at y=4+ and scattered lower. From head at (5,6), safe moves are only UP to (5,7) and LEFT to (4,6)\u2014all others (DOWN into own body at (5,5), RIGHT into own body at (6,6)) are invalid.\n\nAmong the safe options:\n- LEFT leads to a dead end: Moving left holds position near x=4, forcing upward or backward with no path to lower y levels (apples) without getting trapped due to own body blocking down routes at y=5. It closes off future options quickly, contradicting the need to keep moves open.\n- UP opens more paths: This positions me at (5,7) with options to continue up (toward y=9), left (toward open columns for airop maneuverability), or right (after checking for enemy; right at (6,7) isn't immediately blocked). It facilitates a longer-term flanking route around enemy blocks to reach bottom-left apples ((0,5), then potentially (8,0), (2,0), or even (9,1) if enemy doesn't fortify column 9), while avoiding immediate traps. It indirectly counters enemy progress by enabling swifter pivoting if they eat (5,3) and press right or up next.\n\nPrioritizing UP for its superior future flexibility and potential to access multiple apples beats LEFT's restrictive path, keeping the game winnable despite trailing apples. No head-on collision risks with UP, as enemy is distant.\n\nLong-term plan for future turns: Continue upward toward y=8-9 to gain high-ground advantage, then pivot left into open columns (avoiding x=7+ enemy presence). Target (0,5) first for an easy eat, zigzagging up/down along x=0-2 to dodge own remnants and enemy tail-end blocks down toward (2,0) and (8,0). Monitor enemy; if they block left aggressively after eating (5,3), ram them aggressively from the high flank for kills and growth.

I risk getting cornered quickly\u2014potential follow-ups are UP (4,8) or further left (3,7), but not 2+ strong options, and it edges closer to enemy-occupied areas without clear progress.\n\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Positions me closer to (6,1) apple but restricts future moves severely; I can only go UP (6,8) or RIGHT (7,7) safely from there (DOWN hits my body at (6,6)), creating a narrow path near enemy blocks at higher x. This reduces long-term options and increases trapping risk if the enemy maneuvers into column 6-9.\n\n- UP to (5,8): Keeps maximum flexibility with 3 safe follow-ups (further UP to 5,9; LEFT to 4,8; RIGHT to 6,8 nobody body there). It aligns with the plan of gaining high ground to flank around enemy obstructions for lower apples (0,5), (2,0), (8,0).

This move avoids tightness and sets up zigzagging down x=4-0 later via high y, outpacing my own body remnants.\n\nPrioritizing UP for superior mobility and apple-chasing potential over LEFT's dead-end leanings and RIGHT's immediate constriction. No need to ram yet; focus on survival and growth.\n\nLong-term: From (5,8/9), pivot left to x=0-4 at high y to avoid enemy, then drop down column 0 for (0,5) apple, then zigzag to y=0 apples. If enemy eats (6,1) or blocks my path, flank aggressively from above for potential kills. Keep >=2 follow-ups per move.\n\nUP",

Enemy head possible moves (UP to 3,5; DOWN to 3,3; LEFT to 2,4; RIGHT to 4,4) don't overlap targets.\n- Evaluating options:\n  - UP to (3,9): Moves to the top row, limiting follow-ups to only LEFT (2,9) and RIGHT (4,9); excessive risk of entrapment in narrow top row, poor access to most apples in lower board, and no clear advancement. Still alive, but detaches from flanking strategy.\n  - DOWN to (3,7): Four follow-ups possible (UP 3,8; DOWN 3,6; LEFT 2,7; RIGHT 4,7), but drops me closer to enemy head/cluster (they span y=3-6, x=3-9), tightening space unnecessarily early. Viable but reduces long-term flexibility compared to LEFT and misaligns with left-flank plan.\n  - LEFT to (2,8): Four follow-ups possible (UP 2,9; DOWN 2,7; LEFT 1,8; RIGHT 3,8, which becomes safe after move). Maintains high y-position (good for upward options), flanks left toward open space, enables future descent via x-column for reachable apples like (2,0), (8,0 via pivot), or (0,5 via continued LEFT then DOWN). Aligns perfectly with last turn's rationale for mobility and apple pursuit.\n- LEFT keeps the most future options open, avoids enemy proximity, and progresses safely toward apples. No valid alternative improves safety or opportunity without trade-offs.\n\nContinue long-term plan: At (2,8), prioritize another LEFT to (1,8) to maintain high altitude and leftward flank, then descend (e.g., DOWN from (1,8) or (2,8) at y=7-8) once tail clears lower paths (e.g., after (5,5) shifts or is consumed). Target (2,0) via x=2 descent or (0,5)/(8,0) via x=0/x=8 pivots if paths open; avoid committing down near enemy y=3-6. If enemy advances left (e.g., to x=1-2), react by shifting RIGHT via cross-paths like UP then RIGHT, or directly obstruct if feasible.\n\nLEFT",

No likely traps yet; enemy at low y=4 suggests room to descend before confrontation. If they ascend, I can abort to (1,8) backtrack.\n\nLong-term plan: Went DOWN to (1,7). Next turn, prioritize another DOWN to (1,6) to continue decent unless tail (6,6) creates blockage or enemy ascends x=1 aggressively (then RIGHT to (2,7) for space/reaction).

Avoids dead ends; enemy at (0,4) is distant, no head-on risk yet even if they ascend (e.g., to (0,5) conflicts with apple, but unlikely immediate collision). Keeps options open for central/right apples if needed.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Shifts left, good for direct apple pursuit via (0,6)/(0,5), but reduces future options (stuck on left column, harder to pivot right if enemy advances centrally; DOWN would be (0,6), safe). Less balanced than DOWN, as it isolates from center.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Moves away from apple toward right/bottom, potentially toward (2,0) but distant; maintains options (can continue right or revert LEFT), but doesn't directly advance apple hunt. Not preferable when DOWN directly advances last plan.\n\nPrioritizing DOWN for safe apple proximity, options preservation, and plan adherence.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue with DOWN moves to (1,6) then (1,5) if clear, monitoring enemy head at (0,4) for ascensions that might tickle x=0 or force a RIGHT pivot to avoid head-on (e.g., if they go to (0,5), descend LEFT from (1,5) to (0,5) for apple while avoiding collision). Aim to eat (0,5) soon, then assess switching to right apples. Watch for tail blocks (currently at (5,6), will move). If enemy pushes up x=1, consider RIGHT to (2,7) for escape.\n\nDOWN",

Avoiding head-on collisions is straightforward\u2014no enemy can reach (9,7) this turn.\n- After eating (9,7), the head will be at (9,7), and options will open: LEFT to (8,7) to maneuver toward bottom apples like (9,1) or shift rows for (6,1). Enemy likely targeting bottom cluster ((8,0), (2,0), (9,1), (6,1)), so monitor their movements from (6,9)\u2014they can go DOWN/UP/RIGHT, potentially heading south to contest those.\n- Overall, UP increases my apples, keeps multiple escapes (e.g., LEFT into open row7), and avoids traps.

After eating, move LEFT to (8,7) then explore LEFT along row7 toward col6 for (6,1), or DOWN to row6 if safer, keeping distance from enemy body/spears.

LEFT (5,8) empty per board, safe. RIGHT (7,8) into own body, die.\n- Enemy snake head at (8,8) with only dangerous moves: LEFT to (7,8) hits own body? Wait, (7,8) is my body[first], so enemy LEFT moves head into my body, killing enemy. Right (9,8) enemy body. UP (8,9) enemy body. DOWN (8,7) my body. So enemy has no safe move and will die this turn regardless (or die in move). Thus, I prioritize a safe, open move without collision risk.\n- Among safe moves (DOWN or LEFT), LEFT to (5,8) keeps path open west on y=8 (towards x=1-3 range for later descent), maintaining flexibility and minimal constriction (enemy body occupies x=0 but path clear to x=1). DOWN to (6,7) moves south but claustrophobic near own diverging body at (7,7) and lower space limited; postpones shift left.\n- No immediate apples near; long-term plan: Continue LEFT on y=8 (next stops at (4,8) or (3,8), then assess descent via DOWN towards y=1-0 apples at x=2-3-8. Monitor enemy atrophy; if clear, prioritize apple paths like (6,1) under x=6 if open after shift.\n\n### Long-term plan:\nFrom (5,8), aim to continue LEFT to (4,8), (3,8), or (2,8) for open y=8 space near target x=2-3 apples below. At ~x=3-4 on y=8, check for safe DOWN descent (e.g., to y=7 then lower, avoiding own body loops). Race enemy remnants if present; if y=0-1 apples solo-pickable, converge east/west accordingly. Stay north of own upper body tangles.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate each direction:\n  - UP -> (8,9) is part of your own body (appears in the segment list), so you would collide with yourself.\n  - RIGHT -> (9,8) is also part of your body, collision.\n  - DOWN -> (8,7) is occupied by enemy snake #0\u2019s body, collision.\n  - LEFT -> (7,8) is occupied by enemy snake #0\u2019s body, collision.\n\nThus, no safe move exists this turn; any choice results in death. The enemy\u2019s safe options from (6,8) are to move to (6,7) or (5,8); they cannot move into (7,8) since that is their own body. A head-on collision to force mutual death is unlikely since the enemy will avoid stepping into their own body.\n\nPlan:\n- If somehow you survive, steer toward open space and apples (e.g., aim for (9,1) or (6,1) area to break away from the top border and gather apples while avoiding traps).\n- In the near term, avoid returning to the crowded top row to prevent entrapment and dead-ends.\n\nLEFT",
