However, it opens up my next move towards (5, 4), where an apple is located.\n   - **DOWN to (5, 1)**: This will lead me backward into a previous position, which is prohibited.\n   - **LEFT to (4, 2)**: This is a valid move but does not take me toward any apples right away.\n   - **RIGHT to (6, 2)**: This is a valid move but also doesn't lead me toward an apple. \n\n3. **Considerations**:\n   - The apple at (5, 4) is crucial. If I move UP to (5, 3), I can move up again to collect the apple on my next turn.\n   - The enemy snake at (5, 5) does present a risk; however, moving to (5, 3) will not position me in immediate danger since the enemy snake cannot reach me on its next turn while blocked by its body.\n\n### Immediate Strategy:\nGiven the above reasoning, the best move is to go **UP to (5, 3)**. This allows me to safely progress towards the apple at (5, 4) and avoid immediate danger from the enemy snake. \n\nNext move decided: UP"
