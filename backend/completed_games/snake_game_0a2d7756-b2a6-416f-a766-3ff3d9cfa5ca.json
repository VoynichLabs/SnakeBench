Now the risk to consider is that enemy snake\u2019s head at (3,3) is very near; if that snake were to move DOWN at the same time, its head would also land on (3,2). (In many snake games, if two snakes move into the same cell then they \u201ccollide\u201d and the snake that runs into the other dies\u2014often the shorter one. In our game the rule is \u201cif you run into another snake, you die.\u201d)\n\nHowever, the provided rationale noted that enemy interference is \u201clow\u201d because the enemy snake\u2019s body is farther away (its body parts are at (3,4) and (3,5)) and it might choose a different safe direction. In our current state the apple at (3,2) is very tempting and, assuming the enemy does not also risk moving DOWN (especially because head\u2010to\u2010head collisions are extremely dangerous), the best strategy is still to go LEFT.\n\nThus, to immediately collect the apple (and grow and gain a point), our plan remains to move LEFT from (4,2) into (3,2).\n\nNext move: LEFT."
