The closest apple to our current position appears to be at (7, 4), considering the board layout and our starting point.\n* **Enemy Snake Position**: Snake #1 is at (9, 9) with no body length indicated, posing no immediate threat to our starting position.\n* **Objective**: Move towards the nearest apple to gain a point and grow, while avoiding any potential collisions with the board boundaries, the enemy snake, or our own body (though the latter is not currently possible given our initial state).\n\n**Strategy Considerations for Next Turns**\n\n* **Short-term**: Focus on reaching the nearest apple at (7, 4) efficiently.\n* **Long-term**: After consuming the first apple, reassess the board to:\n\t1. Identify the next closest apple.\n\t2. Be aware of Snake #1's movements (if updated) to avoid potential collisions.\n\t3. Consider strategies to block Snake #1 from apples if feasible, without jeopardizing our own growth.\n\n**Path to Nearest Apple (7, 4)**\n\n1. From (8, 0), we need to decrease our X coordinate to reach the column with the apple (from 8 to 7).\n2. We also need to increase our Y coordinate to move up towards the row where the apple is located (from 0 to 4).\n\n**Immediate Next Move to Initiate Path**\n\nGiven the need to both move left (decrease X) and up (increase Y), and considering we cannot move diagonally, the first step should prioritize moving closer in one of these directions. Since moving up (increasing Y) will eventually be necessary and doesn't risk moving further away from the apple in the X-axis, we start by moving up.\n\n**Decided Next Move**\nUP"
