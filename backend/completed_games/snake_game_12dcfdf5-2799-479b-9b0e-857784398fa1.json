That's empty, so it's safe\u2026 for now.\n- DOWN moves to (0,8). Also empty, safe.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT THE ENEMY?**\n- Opponent starts at (8,9). In one tick they can only shift one cell, so they can't reach (0,8) or (1,9) directly. No immediate head\u2011on collision risk.\n- They could eventually drift toward us, but we have a buffer of 8 columns.\n\n**WHICH SAFE DIRECTION IS BETTER?**\n- **Down to (0,8)** puts us on a row (y=8) that actually holds two apples right now: (1,8) and (4,8). Getting there in two moves (down then right, or right then down) puts an apple within easy reach.\n- **Right to (1,9)** moves us horizontally toward apples at (2,0), (3,1), (3,4) etc., but we\u2019d have to climb down later to actually snag them.\n- Staying on y=8 also expands our future move options: from (0,8) we can go up, down, or right \u2013 three viable directions, keeping the board open.\n- From (1,9) we also have three options, but we\u2019re stuck on the top edge (up is blocked) and we\u2019re closer to the opponent\u2019s x\u2011position, which could tighten the battlefield sooner.\n\n**LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**\n- Aim to capture an apple on y=8 ASAP, then keep growing while staying on the lower\u2011half rows where apples are denser.\n- Use the \u201cedge\u2011hug\u201d tactic: stay near the left border (x=0) to force the rival to navigate a narrow corridor, increasing chances of a forced head\u2011on crash.\n- Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s head; if they start moving leftward, we can pivot downward to stay out of their path and set up a trap.\n\nGiven the above, the smartest immediate step is to **move down** and claim that prime row.\n\nDOWN",

Nah, we gotta think long-term.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (8,10) \u2192 off board \u274c DEAD.\n- DOWN: (8,8) \u2192 empty \u2705 safe.\n- LEFT: (7,9) \u2192 empty \u2705 safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) \u2192 empty \u2705 safe.\n\nAll moves except UP are safe. Good.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head at (0,9). Their safe moves: DOWN to (0,8), LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT to (1,9), UP off board \u274c. So they'll likely go DOWN or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT, they're moving toward center. If DOWN, they go for apple at (0,8)? Wait, apple at (0,8)? No, checking board... apples listed: (0,1), (0,5)... not (0,8). So (0,8) is empty. They might go RIGHT to (1,9) to get closer to apples at (1,8) or (2,0)? Not sure.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go LEFT to (7,9), enemy goes RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,9), enemy goes RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 fine.\nIf we go DOWN to (8,8), enemy goes RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 fine.\nNo direct collision possible this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe want to box him in long-term. He's in top-left corner. We're top-right. If we move DOWN or LEFT, we move toward center and cut off his expansion. Moving RIGHT to (9,9) keeps us on edge \u2014 limits future options. Better to move toward center to control board.\n\nLEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8)? \nDOWN gives more flexibility \u2014 can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next. \nLEFT keeps us on top row \u2014 limits downward movement unless we go DOWN next.\n\nI think DOWN is stronger \u2014 opens more paths, starts claiming middle.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nMove toward center, try to get between enemy and the bulk of apples. Force him toward wall. Grow to get length advantage, then aim for head-on collision when we're longer.\n\n**FINAL PICK:** \nDOWN \u2014 centralizing, safe, keeps options open.\n\nDOWN",

Moving **RIGHT** will instantly eat it \u2192 **+1 point** and grow a segment.  \n- What about UP or DOWN? No apple there, and we stay stuck on the edge with fewer future options (UP leads to the top wall, DOWN moves us away from the apple cluster).  \n- After eating the apple we\u2019ll have length\u202f2, so we **can\u2019t go back LEFT** next turn (that would hit our own body).

Moving DOWN gets us closer to those.\n\nBut moving RIGHT to (9,8) puts us on edge \u2014 limits future options. Not ideal.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (to future self):**\nEnemy likely at (1,8) after this turn (ate apple). We need to grow quickly to match length. Aim to cut off their escape from top-left by moving toward (5,8) ish area, while grabbing apples down south. Keep options open, avoid being trapped against our own tail later.\n\n**BEST MOVE:**\nI think DOWN to (8,7) \u2014 opens more future moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN next turn), starts moving toward lower apples, and keeps distance from enemy while we plan next attack.\n\nDOWN",

But we gotta think about **simultaneous enemy move** \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 head at (1,8), body at (0,8), length 2. They just ate an apple last turn (score 1). Their safe moves:\n- UP: (1,9) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- DOWN: (1,7) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (0,8) \u2192 their own body \u274c (can't go backwards into neck)\n- RIGHT: (2,8) \u2192 empty \u2705\n\nThey might go for apple at (4,8) by moving RIGHT twice? But they can only move once this turn. Apple at (3,1) is far. Their closest apple is actually (4,8) or (5,4)? Wait, board shows apple at (4,8) top row. That's 3 steps right from them. They might start heading right.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nOur head at (8,7), theirs at (1,8). No direct collision possible this turn unless they move diagonally (impossible). So safe.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEnemy is in top-left with length 2. We're length 1 at bottom-right. We need to GROW FAST to match and then overpower. Apples nearby: (8,5), (7,6), (7,1), (6,1). Moving DOWN to (8,6) gets us closer to (8,5). Moving LEFT to (7,7) gets us closer to (7,6). Moving RIGHT to (9,7) edges us into corner \u2014 bad. Moving UP to (8,8) moves away from most apples but toward center.\n\nWe also want to **cut off enemy's expansion**. If they go right toward (4,8), we could move up/left to eventually block them. But first, we need length.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nLEFT to (7,7) \u2014 puts us closer to apple at (7,6) for next turn, opens future moves in all directions, and starts moving toward center to intercept enemy's path to lower apples. DOWN to (8,6) also good for apple at (8,5), but LEFT feels more aggressive toward controlling the board center.\n\n**FUTURE SELF NOTE:** Enemy likely moving RIGHT toward (2,8). Next turn, aim for apple at (7,6) or (8,5) to grow. Then push toward (5,8) area to cut off top row from them. Stay flexible!\n\nLEFT",

Apple at (0,5) is directly below them \u2014 they will PROBABLY go DOWN to eat it and grow to length 4! That's dangerous for us \u2014 we need to grow FAST.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nOur head at (8,6), theirs at (0,6). No adjacency, so no possible head-on this turn. Safe.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nWe have 1 apple, they have 2. We NEED to grow to catch up! Closest apple is (8,5) \u2014 ONE STEP DOWN! That's HUGE! Eating it would make us length 3 (still shorter than their potential 4, but closer).\n\n**DOWN (8,5)** \u2192 eat apple, grow, move toward bottom-right cluster of apples (8,0, 7,1, etc.).\n**UP (8,7)** \u2192 safe but away from immediate growth.\n**RIGHT (9,6)** \u2192 safe but onto right edge, fewer options next turn.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & TRAPPING:**\nIf we eat the apple, we become length 3. Enemy might go DOWN to (0,5) and eat apple (0,5) \u2014 they'd be length 4. We need to be aggressive and control the right side. After eating (8,5), we can aim for (8,0) or (7,1) apples to keep growing. Enemy is stuck in left column \u2014 we can slowly box them in by claiming the center and right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nEat the (8,5) apple NOW to grow! Then next turn, from (8,5), consider moving toward (8,0) or (7,1) to continue growing. Avoid moving left into cramped space while enemy is longer. Use our position to control the board's right half and force enemy into a corner. If we match their length, we can threaten head-on collisions.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nDOWN to (8,5) to EAT THE APPLE \ud83c\udf4e and GROW! This is the only move that gets us immediate growth, keeps us safe (not off-board, not into body), and sets up for more apples. UP and RIGHT are safe but passive \u2014 we can't afford to fall further behind in length!\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is on left side, we're on right. We should control the bottom-right corner and grow while keeping distance until we're longer. If we go DOWN to (8,4), next turn we can go LEFT to (7,4) toward center apples, or further DOWN to (8,3). That keeps options open.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,5), we're closer to enemy but also closer to apples (5,4), (4,2). Risky if enemy moves right.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,5), we're on the edge \u2014 next turn only UP/DOWN/LEFT, limiting escape. Not ideal.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nGrow aggressively but avoid risky head-ons while length is tied. Claim the bottom-right apples ((8,0), (7,1), (8,2)) to build length advantage. Once we're longer, push toward enemy and force them into a corner or head-on collision. Keep enemy on the left side \u2014 don't let them get center control.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nDOWN to (8,4) \u2014 moves toward apple cluster, keeps multiple options next turn (LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT), stays away from enemy for now, and avoids the risky edge. Let's secure those apples and build our lead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Apple at (3,4) is close to their DOWN path. Apple at (4,8) is far. They might go DOWN toward (3,4) or RIGHT toward center.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nOur head at (8,4), theirs at (2,6). Not adjacent, so no possible head-on this turn. Safe.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nWe're tied at 2 apples \u2014 NEED TO GET AHEAD! Closest apples to us:\n- (8,2) \u2014 2 steps down\n- (7,1) \u2014 3 steps (down-left then left-down)\n- (8,0) \u2014 4 steps down\n- (4,2) \u2014 4 steps left-down\n- (5,4) \u2014 3 steps left\n\nDOWN gets us closer to (8,2) and the bottom-right apple cluster. LEFT gets us toward (5,4) and (4,2) but moves us closer to enemy territory. RIGHT puts us on the edge at (9,4) \u2014 limiting future options.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & TRAPPING:**\nWe're same length \u2014 head-on collision is risky if we meet. We should grow first! If we go DOWN to (8,3), next turn we can go DOWN again to (8,2) to grab that apple, or LEFT to (7,3) to keep options open. That keeps us in our controlled bottom-right corner.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,4), we're moving toward center \u2014 enemy might also move right/down and we could become adjacent next turn. Risky while tied.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,4), we're on the edge \u2014 next turn only UP/DOWN/LEFT, which could trap us if enemy approaches.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nClaim the bottom-right apples ((8,2), (7,1), (8,0)) to build length advantage. Stay in our corner, grow to 4+ segments, then push left to cut off enemy and force them into a trap. Avoid center until we're longer. If enemy comes toward us, we can use our tail as a barrier.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nDOWN to (8,3) \u2014 moves directly toward the closest apple (8,2), keeps multiple options next turn (LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT), stays in our safe zone, and avoids risky edge/center moves. Let's secure that apple and take the lead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Why sink when we can soar?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **LEFT** \u2192 (3,6) \u2013 straight into our own tail \u2192 instant death \ud83d\udc80, no\u2011go. Would you step on your own foot? I wouldn\u2019t.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,6) \u2013 moves us toward (5,7) but only gives one immediate apple bite. Is a single bite enough? I think we can do better.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 My gut says **UP** feels the most aggressive while preserving flexibility: we can snag (5,7) by moving right next turn, and we can also climb to (4,8) for another quick bite. Plus we stay above the opponent, making it harder for them to cut us off. Who wants to be trapped? Not us!  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term plan:  \n- Grab (5,7) ASAP, then push up to (4,8).  \n- Keep the centre column open and watch #0\u2019s vertical lane; aim to trap them against the right wall.  \n- Always keep at least two safe exits (up/right are currently free).  \n\nUP",

So the real question is: which move gives us more *future flexibility* while staying aggressive?\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **What does the board whisper?**  \n- From **(5,\u202f7)** we can still go **UP** to (5,\u202f8) (another apple), **DOWN** to (5,\u202f6) (empty), or **RIGHT** to (6,\u202f7) (empty). That\u2019s **three** safe exits!  \n- From **(4,\u202f8)** we can go **UP**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT** (to the same (5,\u202f8) apple). Also three exits, but we stay farther from the opponent\u2019s lane at x\u22487.  \n\nWhy do we love the **RIGHT** option?  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple hunger** \u2013 grabbing (5,\u202f7) is the *closest* high\u2011value bite and pushes us right into the opponent\u2019s horizontal corridor.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Pressure cooker** \u2013 moving right forces us closer to a potential head\u2011on clash, and when we finally have a longer tail we can *trap* Snake\u202f#0 against the right wall.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Multiple escapes** \u2013 after we eat that apple we\u2019ll have up, down, and right as viable ways to keep the board open, avoiding dead\u2011ends.  \n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Long\u2011term vision:**  \n- **Turn\u202f1:** Snag (5,\u202f7) \u2192 score\u202f=\u202f3, head at (5,\u202f7).  \n- **Turn\u202f2:** Chase the (5,\u202f8) apple or swing down to (5,\u202f6) to stay flexible.  \n- **Turn\u202f3\u20115:** Continue expanding upward and rightward, aiming to box Snake\u202f#0 against the right edge while we collect the remaining apples in column\u202f5\u20116.  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Bottom line:** The aggressive, apple\u2011filled path that also brings us face\u2011to\u2011face with the rival is **RIGHT**.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN:**  \n- Eat (5,\u202f7) now.  \n- Next turn target (5,\u202f8) or (5,\u202f6) to keep options open.  \n- Gradually drift upward while monitoring the enemy\u2019s vertical lane.  \n- Use our growing length to cut off their escape routes and force a head\u2011on collision when we have the advantage.  \n\nRIGHT",

That extends our lead to 2 apples and makes us longer (5 vs their potential 3 or 4 if they get apple).\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe're longer than enemy now (4 vs 3). If we eat apple, we become 5 vs their max 4. That's huge! A head-on collision when we're longer means WE WIN.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,1) and eat apple:\n- Next turn head at (7,1), body longer.\n- Possible moves: UP (back to (7,2) \u2014 empty then), LEFT (6,1) toward apple, RIGHT (8,1) \u2014 but (8,2) is body? Wait, after moving, our body will be [(7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]? Actually tail is (8,4). So (8,1) is safe next turn? Let's check: after moving DOWN to (7,1), our body becomes: head (7,1), then (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), tail (8,4). So (8,1) is empty. Good.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,2):\n- Moves toward center but no apple.\n- Next turn options open.\n\nIf we go UP to (7,3):\n- Moves away from apples and enemy.\n- Puts us closer to top but fewer apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 PUSH IT! After eating apple, we should aggressively move toward enemy to cut off their space and force a confrontation. They are likely going UP for apple at (4,8). We can move left and up to try to trap them near top wall. Use our long body as a barrier. Maintain apple lead!\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nDOWN to (7,1) \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, GROW TO 5, AND EXTEND OUR LEAD!

Closest apples:\n- (6,1) \u2014 LEFT \ud83c\udf4e **IMMEDIATE APPLE!**\n- (8,0) \u2014 2 steps (DOWN then RIGHT)\n- (4,2) \u2014 3 steps LEFT-DOWN-LEFT\n- (5,4) \u2014 3 steps UP-RIGHT-UP\n\nLEFT gives us an apple instantly and grows us to length 6! That extends our lead to 2 apples and makes us longer (6 vs their potential 4 if they get apple).\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe're longer than enemy now (5 vs 3). If we eat apple, we become 6 vs their max 4. That's massive! A head-on collision when we're longer means WE WIN.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,1) and eat apple:\n- Next turn head at (6,1), body longer.\n- Possible moves: UP (6,2) empty, DOWN (6,0) empty, RIGHT (7,1) \u2014 but that's our old head position? Wait, after moving, our body will be: head (6,1), then (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), tail (8,4). So (7,1) is now our body segment! So RIGHT is NOT safe next turn. So LEFT gives us apple but reduces future options? Let's check carefully: after moving LEFT to (6,1) and eating, new body: [(6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]. So next turn from (6,1):\n    - UP (6,2): empty \u2705\n    - DOWN (6,0): empty \u2705\n    - LEFT (5,1): empty \u2705\n    - RIGHT (7,1): MY BODY \u274c\nSo 3 safe moves next turn. Good.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,0):\n- No apple.\n- Next turn options: LEFT (6,0) toward apple, RIGHT (8,0) toward apple, UP (7,1) \u2014 but that's body? After moving DOWN to (7,0), body: [(7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]? Wait, we didn't eat, so tail stays, body shifts: head (7,0), then (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), tail (8,4). So UP (7,1) is body \u274c. So DOWN gives only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT). Riskier.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,1):\n- No apple.\n- Next turn options: UP (8,2) is body \u274c, DOWN (8,0) empty, LEFT (7,1) is body \u274c, RIGHT (9,1) empty. So only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Also risky.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 PUSH IT! After eating apple, we should aggressively move toward enemy to cut off their space. They are likely going UP for apple at (5,8). We can move left then up to try to trap them near top wall. Use our long body as a barrier. Maintain apple lead!\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nLEFT to (6,1) \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, GROW TO 6, AND EXTEND OUR LEAD! THEN TURN THE SCREWS ON THE ENEMY! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

Traps us on bottom row with fewer options.\n\nDOWN looks dangerous for future flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're longer \u2014 let's use our body as a wall! Enemy is top row, we're mid-bottom. Move UP to control center, grab apple (4,2) soon, then push toward (5,4) to dominate middle. Force enemy to stay top while we grow. If they come down, we can intercept with our longer body for a head-on win. Keep options open \u2014 avoid bottom row trap.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nUP to (5,2) \u2014 keeps 3 safe moves next turn, positions us to snag apple (4,2) next turn, moves toward center control, avoids risky DOWN move. Let's press that length advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Good.\n- Puts us closer to apples (3,4) and (5,4).\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4,1):\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (4,1): UP (4,2) body \u274c, DOWN (4,0) empty, LEFT (3,1) empty (APPLE!), RIGHT (5,1) body \u274c. So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn. Less options.\n- But we could get apple (3,1) next turn if we go LEFT then.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,2):\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (3,2): UP (3,3) empty, DOWN (3,1) empty (APPLE!), LEFT (2,2) empty, RIGHT (4,2) body \u274c. So 3 safe moves.\n- Also moves us toward enemy's predicted path? Enemy going to (3,8), we're far.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nEnemy is forced LEFT to (3,8) this turn. We are tied in length. We need to use our position to cut off their escape and dominate the board. Going UP gives us the most options and central control. We can then push toward top-left or top-right to box them in. They are in the top-left area now. If we go UP, we stay flexible and can start walling off the center. Avoid going DOWN into a corner with fewer options. Let's keep the pressure and maintain mobility!\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nUP to (4,3) \u2014 keeps maximum options, moves toward central apples, and sets up for future aggression!

But we must think strategically \u2014 eating grows us but also reduces mobility slightly. We are longer (6 apples vs 5). We can afford to be aggressive and maybe force a head-on if we meet them.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY ANALYSIS:**\nIf we go LEFT to (3,4) and eat apple:\n- We grow to length 8. New tail stays at (7,1)? Actually body extends: new head at (3,4), body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)].\n- Next turn from (3,4): UP (3,5) empty, DOWN (3,3) empty, LEFT (2,4) empty, RIGHT (4,4) body \u274c. 3 safe moves.

But we miss immediate apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe are longer! Let's use that advantage. Enemy is above us at (3,7). If we go LEFT and eat apple at (3,4), we position ourselves to potentially cut off enemy's descent down the left side. If we go RIGHT and eat apple, we control center-right. LEFT might be better for blocking \u2014 enemy might move DOWN toward (3,6) then (3,5) etc. We can intercept. Also, eating apple increases our lead to 7-5, making head-on collisions even more in our favor! Let's take the apple on the left and pressure them!\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nLEFT to (3,4) \u2014 grab that apple, increase our lead, and position to cut off enemy's path down!

LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- **MY HEAD:** (3, 4) \ud83d\udc0d (Length 8)\n- **MY BODY:** [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]\n- **ENEMY HEAD:** (3, 6) \ud83d\ude08 (They moved DOWN last turn! They're right above us now!)\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (3,4):**\n- **UP:** (3, 5) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (3, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- **LEFT:** (2, 4) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 4) \u2192 MY OWN BODY \u274c (that's our neck! instant death)\n\nRIGHT is OUT. We have UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe moves.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nOur head at (3,4), theirs at (3,6) \u2014 NOT adjacent (they are 2 cells above). No possible head-on this turn. Safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head at (3,6). Their safe moves:\n- UP: (3, 7) \u2192 their own body \u274c (neck!)\n- DOWN: (3, 5) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (2, 6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT: (4, 6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n\nThey have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT available. They might move DOWN toward us! If they go DOWN to (3,5), they'll be adjacent to our head next turn! That's a potential head-on clash! We have length advantage (8 vs 6), so head-on would kill them, not us! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**APPLE FOCUS:**\nApples nearby: (3,1) below, (2,0) left-down, (2,1) left-down, (0,1) far left, (0,5) far left-up, (1,7) far up-left. But we should think AGGRESSIVELY \u2014 we want to pressure the enemy, not just chase apples.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY ANALYSIS:**\nIf we go UP to (3,5):\n- That's where enemy might go DOWN to! If we both go into (3,5) \u2014 HEAD-ON COLLISION! We win because we're longer! \ud83c\udfaf That's a HUGE play! But if they go LEFT or RIGHT, we just move into empty cell.\n- Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) enemy current head (but they'll move), DOWN (3,4) our old head (empty after move), LEFT (2,5) empty, RIGHT (4,5) empty. Likely 3 safe moves unless enemy stays.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,3):\n- Avoids potential clash, moves toward apple at (3,1). But gives up pressure. Next turn from (3,3): UP (3,4) empty, DOWN (3,2) empty, LEFT (2,3) empty, RIGHT (4,3) our body? Wait, (4,3) is our body segment! That would be unsafe next turn? Actually after moving, our body shifts: new head (3,3), body becomes [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)]. So (4,3) is in our body! So RIGHT would be blocked next turn. Mobility reduces.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,4):\n- Moves away from enemy, toward left side apples. Next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5) empty, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) empty. All 4 directions safe! Good mobility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe are LONGER! We want to force a head-on collision while we have the advantage! Enemy is at (3,6) with possible moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. If we go UP to (3,5), we threaten to meet them if they go DOWN \u2014 that's a risk for THEM, not us! They might avoid it, but then we pressure them upward. Let's be AGGRESSIVE and take the center! If they go DOWN, we win. If they don't, we still have good options next turn. DOMINANCE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nUP to (3,5) \u2014 force the issue! Pressure the enemy with our length advantage! Let's go for the head-on chance! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",
