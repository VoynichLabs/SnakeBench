I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe.

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 3) and RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\nNow, let's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 4) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n- To (1, 4): |0-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1 (This apple is adjacent!)\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |4-8| = 8 + 4 = 12\n- To (1, 3): |0-1| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4), which is only 1 step away.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 3): From (0, 3), the distance to the apple at (1, 4) is |0-1| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 4): This move takes me directly onto the apple at (1, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the optimal move as it allows me to eat the closest apple immediately. It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

His length is 7.\n\nLet's determine the safe moves from my current position (0, 4):\n1.  Move UP to (0, 5): This position is occupied by my body segment (0, 5). Since this is not my tail (5, 6), moving here would result in a self-collision. Unsafe.\n2.  Move DOWN to (0, 3): This position is within the board limits and is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n3.  Move LEFT to (-1, 4): This position is outside the board limits (a wall). Unsafe.\n4.  Move RIGHT to (1, 4): This position is within the board limits. It contains an apple. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Moving here is safe and results in eating the apple. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 3) and RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\nNow, let's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 4) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n- To (1, 4): |0-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1 (This apple is adjacent!)\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |4-8| = 8 + 4 = 12\n- To (1, 3): |0-1| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4), which is only 1 step away.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 3): From (0, 3), the distance to the apple at (1, 4) is |0-1| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 4): This move takes me directly onto the apple at (1, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the optimal move as it allows me to eat the closest apple immediately. It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The UP line leaves us more maneuver room.\n\nRIGHT or DOWN collide with ourselves.\n\nEnemy #1 is far away (head at (0, 5)).

My length is 10, having just eaten an apple at (0, 5).\nThe apples are at: (9, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (8, 8), (1, 3).\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with body at [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)].\n\nLet's identify the safe moves from my current position (0, 5):\n- UP to (0, 6): (0, 6) is part of my body and is not the tail (6, 6). Moving here would be a self-collision. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (0, 4): (0, 4) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- LEFT to (-1, 5): (-1, 5) is outside the board (wall). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT.

Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety.

From (1, 2), the distance to the apple at (0, 3) is |1-0| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Move LEFT to (0, 3): This move is safe and takes me directly onto the closest apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 3) is the optimal move as it allows me to eat the closest apple immediately and is a safe move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (0, 3), my head will be there. My length will increase. I will need to reassess safe moves from (0, 3), avoiding my new longer body, enemy snakes, and walls, while seeking the next closest apple from the remaining list.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

My length is 10, having just eaten an apple at (0, 5).\nThe apples are at: (9, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (8, 8), (1, 3).\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with body at [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)].\n\nLet's identify the safe moves from my current position (0, 5):\n- UP to (0, 6): (0, 6) is part of my body and is not the tail (6, 6).

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

If the corridor at y = 5 stays open, keep marching RIGHT to take the apple at (9,5) in three more moves.\n3. If the enemy unexpectedly drops to y = 5 before we arrive, be ready to fall back DOWN to y = 4 and circle around.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake/body. Safe. This location contains an apple.\n- DOWN to (1, 5): (1,5) is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake/body. Safe.\n- LEFT to (0, 6): (0,6) is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake/body. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): (2,6) is within bounds. It is occupied by my body segment. Unsafe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (1, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |1-0| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (3, 2): |1-3| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- to (9, 5): |1-9| + |6-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n- to (1, 7): |1-1| + |6-7| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- to (2, 4): |1-2| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 7) with a distance of 1.\n\nNow I evaluate the safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) based on how they move me towards the closest apple (1, 7):\n- Current distance to (1, 7) from (1, 6) is 1.\n- Moving UP to (1, 7): From (1, 7), the distance to (1, 7) is |1-1| + |7-7| = 0 + 0 = 0. This decreases the distance and reaches the apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to (1, 7) is |1-1| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2. This increases the distance.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 6): From (0, 6), the distance to (1, 7) is |0-1| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2. This increases the distance.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 7) is a safe move that brings me directly to the nearest apple.\n\nNext turn strategy: I will have just eaten the apple at (1, 7).

Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 3) and RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\nNow, let's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 4) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n- To (1, 4): |0-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1 (This apple is adjacent!)\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |4-8| = 8 + 4 = 12\n- To (1, 3): |0-1| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4), which is only 1 step away.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 3): From (0, 3), the distance to the apple at (1, 4) is |0-1| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 4): This move takes me directly onto the apple at (1, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the optimal move as it allows me to eat the closest apple immediately. It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or any enemy snake body segment. Safe.\n- DOWN to (3, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body or any enemy snake body segment. Safe.\n- LEFT to (2, 2): This position is occupied by my body (the segment immediately behind my head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (4, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body or any enemy snake body segment. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (3, 3), DOWN to (3, 1), and RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nLet's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (3, 2) is at (2, 7) with a Manhattan distance of |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. The next closest apple is at (4, 9) with a distance of |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (3, 3): New position (3, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5. Moves closer.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 1): New position (3, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): New position (4, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |4-2| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7. Moves away.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. Let's check the path towards (2, 7) from (3, 3). A likely path is (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 7). Checking these positions:\n- (3, 3) is safe (checked above).\n- (2, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 4) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 5) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 6) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 7) is the apple. Safe.\nThis path to the closest apple appears clear from immediate obstacles.\n\nLet's evaluate moving RIGHT towards the next closest apple (4, 9). From (4, 2), the shortest path involves moving UP towards y=9.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe (checked above).\n- From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3). (4, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- From (4, 3), move UP to (4, 4). (4, 4) is occupied by the enemy snake body. Unsafe. The direct path towards (4, 9) is blocked.\n\nMoving DOWN moves away from both closest apples.\n\nMoving UP towards the apple at (2, 7) seems the safest and most direct route to food among the safe options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving LEFT to (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my current body segments [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body segments [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. It is not occupied by the enemy head (7, 5). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 2): This position is occupied by my body [(1, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head]. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (2, 2) is at (2, 7), with a Manhattan distance of |2-2| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on the distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (2, 3): New position (2, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Safe.\n- LEFT to (-1, 7): (-1, 7) is outside the board bounds (wall). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1, 7): (1, 7) is within bounds. It is occupied by the first segment of my body. Since I did not eat an apple last turn, my tail (6, 7) will be removed. However, (1, 7) is not the tail segment. Moving onto (1, 7) would be a self-collision. Unsafe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP (to (0, 8)) and DOWN (to (0, 6)).\n\nNext, I find the closest apples from my current position (0, 7) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |0-0| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |7-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |7-8| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (0, 5) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow I evaluate the safe moves (UP, DOWN) based on how they move me towards the closest apple (0, 5):\n- Current distance to (0, 5) from (0, 7) is 2.\n  - Moving UP to (0, 8): From (0, 8), distance to (0, 5) is |0-0| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3. Increases distance.\n  - Moving DOWN to (0, 6): From (0, 6), distance to (0, 5) is |0-0| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1. Decreases distance.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 6) is the only safe move that decreases the distance to the closest apple (0, 5). The path from (0, 7) to (0, 6) and then to (0, 5) (the apple) appears clear and safe.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving DOWN to (0, 6), my head will be at (0, 6) and my body will be [(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. The tail (6, 7) will be removed. The closest apple will still be at (0, 5). I will then plan to move DOWN again to (0, 5) to consume the apple.\n\nDOWN"

Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Move LEFT to (-1, 3): This position is outside the board limits (x < 0). Moving here would result in a wall collision. Unsafe.\n4.  Move RIGHT to (1, 3): This position is occupied by my body segment (1, 3). Since I ate an apple on the previous turn, this segment will not be freed. Moving here would result in a self-collision.

Survival is the top priority.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From position (0, 2), I will assess safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Based on the current board state and the positions of my body, enemy snakes, and apples, I will choose the safe move that best positions me to either move towards the closest apple or secure a safe longer path if immediate paths are blocked or dangerous. I will need to recalculate distances to apples and evaluate safety considering my new body position and the enemy's likely move.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal.

Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples.

This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Checking these positions:\n- (3, 3) is safe (checked above).\n- (2, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 4) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 5) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 6) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 7) is the apple. Safe.\nThis path to the closest apple appears clear from immediate obstacles.\n\nLet's evaluate moving RIGHT towards the next closest apple (4, 9). From (4, 2), the shortest path involves moving UP towards y=9.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe (checked above).\n- From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3). (4, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- From (4, 3), move UP to (4, 4). (4, 4) is occupied by the enemy snake body. Unsafe. The direct path towards (4, 9) is blocked.\n\nMoving DOWN moves away from both closest apples.\n\nMoving UP towards the apple at (2, 7) seems the safest and most direct route to food among the safe options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving LEFT to (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Moving UP from (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked by the enemy.\n\nConsidering my snake's current position primarily on the left side of the board and the enemy snake's position on the right, moving LEFT towards the apple at (2, 7) keeps me in a less contested area and seems a reasonable strategy to secure food while minimizing potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving UP to (2, 4) from (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 7): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 7) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 4.\n\nMoving DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6) is the first step towards the closest apple at (6, 3). This move is safe. Moving LEFT towards (1,6) or (0,5) is also a safe option, but DOWN leads to the currently closest apple.\n\nTherefore, I will move DOWN.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (6, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position. The path directly DOWN towards the closest apple at (6, 3) goes through (6, 5), which is currently occupied by the enemy snake's head. If (6, 5) is still occupied, I will need to find an alternative safe path to (6, 3) or target the next closest reachable apple.\n\nDOWN"

This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe.

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Checking these positions:\n- (3, 3) is safe (checked above).\n- (2, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 4) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 5) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 6) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 7) is the apple. Safe.\nThis path to the closest apple appears clear from immediate obstacles.\n\nLet's evaluate moving RIGHT towards the next closest apple (4, 9). From (4, 2), the shortest path involves moving UP towards y=9.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe (checked above).\n- From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3). (4, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- From (4, 3), move UP to (4, 4). (4, 4) is occupied by the enemy snake body. Unsafe. The direct path towards (4, 9) is blocked.\n\nMoving DOWN moves away from both closest apples.\n\nMoving UP towards the apple at (2, 7) seems the safest and most direct route to food among the safe options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving LEFT to (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Moving UP from (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked by the enemy.\n\nConsidering my snake's current position primarily on the left side of the board and the enemy snake's position on the right, moving LEFT towards the apple at (2, 7) keeps me in a less contested area and seems a reasonable strategy to secure food while minimizing potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving UP to (2, 4) from (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Moving here is safe and results in eating the apple. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 3) and RIGHT to (1, 4).\n\nNow, let's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 4) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |4-5| = 9 + 1 = 10\n- To (1, 4): |0-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1 (This apple is adjacent!)\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |4-8| = 8 + 4 = 12\n- To (1, 3): |0-1| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4), which is only 1 step away.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 3): From (0, 3), the distance to the apple at (1, 4) is |0-1| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 4): This move takes me directly onto the apple at (1, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the optimal move as it allows me to eat the closest apple immediately. It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The tail is currently at (0, 4).\nThe available apples are at: (8, 8), (8, 9), (4, 9), (4, 0), (5, 0). The apple at (3, 7) has been eaten.\nThe enemy snake's head is at (6, 2), and its body is at [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (3, 7):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The square (3, 8) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The square (3, 6) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n- Move LEFT to (2, 7): The square (2, 7) is currently occupied by the first segment of my body ('T'). Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The square (4, 7) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Based on the current board state and the positions of my body, enemy snakes, and apples, I will choose the safe move that best positions me to either move towards the closest apple or secure a safe longer path if immediate paths are blocked or dangerous. I will need to recalculate distances to apples and evaluate safety considering my new body position and the enemy's likely move.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (4, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |4-8| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- To (8, 9): |4-8| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (4, 9): |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- To (4, 0): |4-4| + |7-0| = 0 + 7 = 7\n- To (5, 0): |4-5| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (4, 8): The new position is (4, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (4, 6): The new position is (4, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 7): The new position is (5, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |5-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) is the only safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. This move brings my snake one step closer to eating the apple at (4, 9). The square (4, 8) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to check if the square (4,9) is still an apple and safe to move into. If so, I will likely move UP again to eat the apple.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my current body segments [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body segments [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. It is not occupied by the enemy head (7, 5). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 2): This position is occupied by my body [(1, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head]. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (2, 2) is at (2, 7), with a Manhattan distance of |2-2| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on the distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (2, 3): New position (2, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The square (4, 7) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (4, 6): The new position is (4, 6).

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Checking these positions:\n- (3, 3) is safe (checked above).\n- (2, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 4) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 5) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 6) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 7) is the apple. Safe.\nThis path to the closest apple appears clear from immediate obstacles.\n\nLet's evaluate moving RIGHT towards the next closest apple (4, 9). From (4, 2), the shortest path involves moving UP towards y=9.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe (checked above).\n- From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3). (4, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- From (4, 3), move UP to (4, 4). (4, 4) is occupied by the enemy snake body. Unsafe. The direct path towards (4, 9) is blocked.\n\nMoving DOWN moves away from both closest apples.\n\nMoving UP towards the apple at (2, 7) seems the safest and most direct route to food among the safe options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving LEFT to (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Moving UP from (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked by the enemy.\n\nConsidering my snake's current position primarily on the left side of the board and the enemy snake's position on the right, moving LEFT towards the apple at (2, 7) keeps me in a less contested area and seems a reasonable strategy to secure food while minimizing potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving UP to (2, 4) from (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

The tail is currently at (0, 4).\nThe available apples are at: (8, 8), (8, 9), (4, 9), (4, 0), (5, 0). The apple at (3, 7) has been eaten.\nThe enemy snake's head is at (6, 2), and its body is at [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (3, 7):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The square (3, 8) is empty ('.') on the board.

Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The square (4, 7) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The square (4, 7) is empty ('.') on the board. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I need to choose a safe move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) that leads me towards an apple.\n\nFirst, I check for safe moves from (6, 6):\n- UP to (6, 7): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Occupied by the enemy snake's body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): Within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNext, I find the closest apple from my current position (6, 6) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (0, 5): |6-0| + |6-5| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- to (3, 2): |6-3| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- to (1, 6): |6-1| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- to (6, 3): |6-6| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- to (6, 1): |6-6| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 3) with a distance of 3. However, the path directly towards (6, 3) is blocked by the enemy snake at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n\nConsidering the safe moves LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 6): This move is safe. From (5, 6), the distance to (1, 6) is |5-1| + |6-6| = 4, and the distance to (0, 5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 6. It also reduces the distance to (3,2) and (6,1) compared to moving Right. This moves me towards apples on the left side of the board, including the second closest apple (1,6).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 6): This move is safe. From (7, 6), the distance to (6, 3) is |7-6| + |6-3| = 4, distance to (1, 6) is |7-1| + |6-6| = 6, distance to (0, 5) is |7-0| + |6-5| = 8. Moving RIGHT increases the distance to all apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) is the strategic choice as it heads towards closer, currently unblocked apples like (1, 6) and (0, 5).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (5, 6), I will re-evaluate the safe moves from that position (likely UP and LEFT) and target the closest reachable apple, which will likely be (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Checking these positions:\n- (3, 3) is safe (checked above).\n- (2, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 4) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 5) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 6) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- (2, 7) is the apple. Safe.\nThis path to the closest apple appears clear from immediate obstacles.\n\nLet's evaluate moving RIGHT towards the next closest apple (4, 9). From (4, 2), the shortest path involves moving UP towards y=9.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe (checked above).\n- From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3). (4, 3) is not in my body or enemy body, and is empty on the board. Safe.\n- From (4, 3), move UP to (4, 4). (4, 4) is occupied by the enemy snake body. Unsafe. The direct path towards (4, 9) is blocked.\n\nMoving DOWN moves away from both closest apples.\n\nMoving UP towards the apple at (2, 7) seems the safest and most direct route to food among the safe options.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving LEFT to (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Moving UP from (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked by the enemy.\n\nConsidering my snake's current position primarily on the left side of the board and the enemy snake's position on the right, moving LEFT towards the apple at (2, 7) keeps me in a less contested area and seems a reasonable strategy to secure food while minimizing potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving UP to (2, 4) from (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Safe.\n\nSafe moves are DOWN (to (5, 7)) and RIGHT (to (6, 8)).\n\nThe closest apple to my current position (5, 8) is at (5, 7), which is a distance of |5-5| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. The apple at (5, 6) is also close, at a distance of |5-5| + |6-8| = 0 + 2 = 2. The apple at (8, 8) is at |8-5| + |8-8| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 7) allows me to eat the closest apple immediately.\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 8) goes to an empty square. From (6, 8), the distance to the closest apple at (5, 7) would be |5-6| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMoving DOWN is the optimal move as it secures the closest food source. The enemy snake is far away and does not currently pose a threat to this path.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving DOWN to (5,7) and eating the apple, my head will be at (5,7). I will then evaluate safe moves from (5,7) with the goal of reaching the next closest apple, likely (5,6), while avoiding collisions with my growing body and the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my current body segments [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body segments [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. It is not occupied by the enemy head (7, 5). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 2): This position is occupied by my body [(1, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head]. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (2, 2) is at (2, 7), with a Manhattan distance of |2-2| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on the distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (2, 3): New position (2, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The enemy snake is currently far from these potential paths.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best choice among the safe options to make progress towards the nearest apples.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue navigating towards the apple at (5, 7) from my new position at (5, 9), prioritizing safe moves while considering the locations of other snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Note that (4, 9) is now the first segment of my body.\nThe board dimensions are 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (8, 9), (5, 7), (8, 7), (5, 6).\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (4, 0), body at [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (5, 9):\n- Move UP to (5, 10): This coordinate is outside the board boundary (y > 9). This move is unsafe (wall collision).\n- Move DOWN to (5, 8): The square (5, 8) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n- Move LEFT to (4, 9): The square (4, 9) is occupied by the first segment of my body. Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 9): The square (6, 9) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. The available apples from my current position (5, 9) are at (8, 8), (8, 9), (5, 7), (8, 7), (5, 6). Let's calculate the Manhattan distances:\n- (8, 8): |8-5| + |8-9| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (8, 9): |8-5| + |9-9| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (5, 7): |5-5| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- (8, 7): |8-5| + |7-9| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- (5, 6): |5-5| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 7) with a distance of 2. The next closest are at (8, 9) and (5, 6) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on distance to the closest apple (5, 7):\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 8), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-5| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. This moves me directly towards the closest apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6, 9), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-6| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This moves me away from the closest apple.\n\nMoving DOWN is the safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. Moving DOWN to (5,8) also positions me well to potentially reach the apple at (5,6) (distance 2 from (5,8) vs 3 from (5,9)) and the apple at (5,7) (distance 1 from (5,8) vs 2 from (5,9)) in subsequent moves.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently far away and not posing an immediate threat to the path towards the closest apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the best choice among the safe options to make progress towards the nearest apples.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue navigating towards the apple at (5, 7) from my new position at (5, 8), prioritizing safe moves while considering the locations of other snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety.

Moving UP from (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked by the enemy.\n\nConsidering my snake's current position primarily on the left side of the board and the enemy snake's position on the right, moving LEFT towards the apple at (2, 7) keeps me in a less contested area and seems a reasonable strategy to secure food while minimizing potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7), likely moving UP to (2, 4) from (2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (4, 6): The new position is (4, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 7): The new position is (5, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |5-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3.

Safe.\n- Move LEFT to (4, 6): This square is empty according to the board state and snake positions.

My length is 10, having just eaten an apple at (0, 5).\nThe apples are at: (9, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (8, 8), (1, 3).\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with body at [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)].\n\nLet's identify the safe moves from my current position (0, 5):\n- UP to (0, 6): (0, 6) is part of my body and is not the tail (6, 6).

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my current body segments [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body segments [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. It is not occupied by the enemy head (7, 5). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 2): This position is occupied by my body [(1, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head]. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (2, 2) is at (2, 7), with a Manhattan distance of |2-2| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on the distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (2, 3): New position (2, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Note that (4, 9) is now the first segment of my body.\nThe board dimensions are 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (8, 9), (5, 7), (8, 7), (5, 6).\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (4, 0), body at [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (5, 9):\n- Move UP to (5, 10): This coordinate is outside the board boundary (y > 9). This move is unsafe (wall collision).\n- Move DOWN to (5, 8): The square (5, 8) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n- Move LEFT to (4, 9): The square (4, 9) is occupied by the first segment of my body. Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 9): The square (6, 9) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The next closest are at (8, 9) and (5, 6) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on distance to the closest apple (5, 7):\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 8), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-5| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. This moves me directly towards the closest apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6, 9), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-6| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This moves me away from the closest apple.\n\nMoving DOWN is the safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. Moving DOWN to (5,8) also positions me well to potentially reach the apple at (5,6) (distance 2 from (5,8) vs 3 from (5,9)) and the apple at (5,7) (distance 1 from (5,8) vs 2 from (5,9)) in subsequent moves.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently far away and not posing an immediate threat to the path towards the closest apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the best choice among the safe options to make progress towards the nearest apples.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue navigating towards the apple at (5, 7) from my new position at (5, 8), prioritizing safe moves while considering the locations of other snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This positions me on the same X-coordinate as the primary apple cluster and directly adjacent to the closest apple at (8, 7).\n\nNext turn strategy: My head will be at (8, 6). The apple at (8, 7) is now adjacent. I will check if moving UP to (8, 7) is safe (not occupied by the enemy or my own body segments, excluding the tail which will have moved). If safe, I will move UP to eat the apple. If not safe, I will evaluate other safe moves from (8, 6) towards the remaining apples, keeping track of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my current body segments [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body segments [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. It is not occupied by the enemy head (7, 5). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 1): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 2): This position is occupied by my body [(1, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head]. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (3, 2): This position is within board limits. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The closest apple from my current position (2, 2) is at (2, 7), with a Manhattan distance of |2-2| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on the distance to the closest apple (2, 7):\n- Move UP to (2, 3): New position (2, 3). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |3-7| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves closer to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): New position (2, 1). Distance to (2, 7) is |2-2| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): New position (3, 2). Distance to (2, 7) is |3-2| + |2-7| = 1 + 5 = 6. This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Note that (4, 9) is now the first segment of my body.\nThe board dimensions are 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (8, 8), (8, 9), (5, 7), (8, 7), (5, 6).\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (4, 0), body at [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)].\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (5, 9):\n- Move UP to (5, 10): This coordinate is outside the board boundary (y > 9). This move is unsafe (wall collision).\n- Move DOWN to (5, 8): The square (5, 8) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n- Move LEFT to (4, 9): The square (4, 9) is occupied by the first segment of my body. Moving here would result in a collision with my own body, making this move unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 9): The square (6, 9) is empty. It is not in my body segments or the enemy snake's head or body. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples.

The next closest are at (8, 9) and (5, 6) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on distance to the closest apple (5, 7):\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 8), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-5| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. This moves me directly towards the closest apple.\n- If I move RIGHT to (6, 9), the distance to (5, 7) becomes |5-6| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This moves me away from the closest apple.\n\nMoving DOWN is the safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. Moving DOWN to (5,8) also positions me well to potentially reach the apple at (5,6) (distance 2 from (5,8) vs 3 from (5,9)) and the apple at (5,7) (distance 1 from (5,8) vs 2 from (5,9)) in subsequent moves.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently far away and not posing an immediate threat to the path towards the closest apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the best choice among the safe options to make progress towards the nearest apples.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue navigating towards the apple at (5, 7) from my new position at (5, 8), prioritizing safe moves while considering the locations of other snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

My length is 10, having just eaten an apple at (0, 5).\nThe apples are at: (9, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (8, 8), (1, 3).\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with body at [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)].\n\nLet's identify the safe moves from my current position (0, 5):\n- UP to (0, 6): (0, 6) is part of my body and is not the tail (6, 6). Moving here would be a self-collision. Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (0, 4): (0, 4) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n- LEFT to (-1, 5): (-1, 5) is outside the board (wall). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): (1, 5) is within bounds, not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Safe.\n- Move DOWN to (7, 5): This square is empty ('.'). Safe.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 6): This square is occupied by the first segment of my body ('T').

Safe.\n\nSafe moves are UP (to (7, 7)), DOWN (to (7, 5)), and RIGHT (to (8, 6)).\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple at (8, 7):\n- Move UP to (7, 7): New distance to (8, 7) is abs(8-7) + abs(7-7) = 1 + 0 = 1. (Decreases distance)\n- Move DOWN to (7, 5): New distance to (8, 7) is abs(8-7) + abs(7-5) = 1 + 2 = 3.

Moving RIGHT to (8,6) positions me at X=8, which aligns better with the X-coordinate of the apple cluster. Moving UP to (7,7) positions me at Y=7, which aligns better with the Y-coordinate of the closest apple (8,7).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 3) and does not pose an immediate threat to my safe moves.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (8, 6). This positions me on the same X-coordinate as the primary apple cluster and directly adjacent to the closest apple at (8, 7).\n\nNext turn strategy: My head will be at (8, 6). The apple at (8, 7) is now adjacent. I will check if moving UP to (8, 7) is safe (not occupied by the enemy or my own body segments, excluding the tail which will have moved). If safe, I will move UP to eat the apple. If not safe, I will evaluate other safe moves from (8, 6) towards the remaining apples, keeping track of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to either destination square.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the move that allows for potentially easier access to the next apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Assuming I successfully move UP to (8, 8) and eat the apple, my head will be at (8, 8). I will then evaluate moving UP to (8, 9) to get the next apple, checking for safety (walls, my body, enemy snake) at the new position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Unsafe.\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN to (0, 2).\n\nLet's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 3) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |3-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |3-8| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |3-7| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |0-8| + |3-9| = 8 + 6 = 14\n- To (4, 9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 7) with a distance of 6.\n\nEvaluating the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 2): This move is safe but moves me away from the closest apple at (2,7) (new distance from (0,2) is |0-2| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7).\n\nWhile moving DOWN does not immediately lead towards the closest apple, it is the only safe move available. Survival is the top priority.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From position (0, 2), I will assess safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Based on the current board state and the positions of my body, enemy snakes, and apples, I will choose the safe move that best positions me to either move towards the closest apple or secure a safe longer path if immediate paths are blocked or dangerous. I will need to recalculate distances to apples and evaluate safety considering my new body position and the enemy's likely move.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (4, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |4-8| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- To (8, 9): |4-8| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (4, 9): |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- To (4, 0): |4-4| + |7-0| = 0 + 7 = 7\n- To (5, 0): |4-5| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (4, 8): The new position is (4, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (4, 6): The new position is (4, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 7): The new position is (5, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |5-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) is the only safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. This move brings my snake one step closer to eating the apple at (4, 9). The square (4, 8) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to check if the square (4,9) is still an apple and safe to move into. If so, I will likely move UP again to eat the apple.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

I will continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Move UP to (8, 8):\n    -   This square is within the board boundaries.\n    -   This square is not currently occupied by my body.\n    -   This square is not currently occupied by the enemy snake.\n    -   There is an apple at (8, 8).\n    -   This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\n2.

Both UP and RIGHT lead to squares containing apples.\nMoving UP to (8, 8) gets an apple and positions me adjacent to another apple at (8, 9).\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 7) gets an apple and positions me near the cluster of apples at (8, 8) and (8, 9), but slightly further away than if I moved UP.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are excellent choices. Moving UP to (8, 8) seems slightly better for setting up the next move towards the apple at (8, 9). The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to either destination square.\n\nTherefore, I will choose the move that allows for potentially easier access to the next apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Assuming I successfully move UP to (8, 8) and eat the apple, my head will be at (8, 8). I will then evaluate moving UP to (8, 9) to get the next apple, checking for safety (walls, my body, enemy snake) at the new position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Unsafe.\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN to (0, 2).\n\nLet's find the closest apple from my current position (0, 3) using Manhattan distance:\n- To (9, 5): |0-9| + |3-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\n- To (8, 8): |0-8| + |3-8| = 8 + 5 = 13\n- To (2, 7): |0-2| + |3-7| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |0-8| + |3-9| = 8 + 6 = 14\n- To (4, 9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 7) with a distance of 6.\n\nEvaluating the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 2): This move is safe but moves me away from the closest apple at (2,7) (new distance from (0,2) is |0-2| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7).\n\nWhile moving DOWN does not immediately lead towards the closest apple, it is the only safe move available. Survival is the top priority.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From position (0, 2), I will assess safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Based on the current board state and the positions of my body, enemy snakes, and apples, I will choose the safe move that best positions me to either move towards the closest apple or secure a safe longer path if immediate paths are blocked or dangerous. I will need to recalculate distances to apples and evaluate safety considering my new body position and the enemy's likely move.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

I find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (4, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |4-8| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- To (8, 9): |4-8| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (4, 9): |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- To (4, 0): |4-4| + |7-0| = 0 + 7 = 7\n- To (5, 0): |4-5| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (4, 8): The new position is (4, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (4, 6): The new position is (4, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 7): The new position is (5, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |5-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3. This move increases the distance.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) is the only safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple. This move brings my snake one step closer to eating the apple at (4, 9). The square (4, 8) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to check if the square (4,9) is still an apple and safe to move into. If so, I will likely move UP again to eat the apple.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) and RIGHT to (1, 5).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current position (0, 5) using Manhattan distance:\n- to (9, 5): |0-9| + |5-5| = 9 + 0 = 9\n- to (2, 4): |0-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- to (1, 4): |0-1| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- to (8, 8): |0-8| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11\n- to (1, 3): |0-1| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a distance of 2. The next closest are (2, 4) and (1, 3) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 4): From (0, 4), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |0-1| + |4-4| = 1. This move puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 5): From (1, 5), the distance to apple (1, 4) is |1-1| + |5-4| = 1. This move also puts me one step away from the closest apple.\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position that is one step away from the closest apple at (1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at (2, 3). His closest apples are likely (2, 4) (dist 1) and (1, 3) or (1, 4) (dist 2). It is highly probable he will move UP to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4), the apple at (2, 4) will be gone. The closest apples for me from my potential next positions (0, 4) or (1, 5) will be (1, 4) and (1, 3). Both (0,4) and (1,5) are 1 step away from (1,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 4) keeps me along the left edge of the board. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) moves me slightly towards the cluster of apples and closer to Snake #0's operating area. Given my long body, staying along the edge can sometimes provide safer movement options. Both moves are good for reaching the next apple, but moving DOWN seems slightly safer in terms of potential future pathing and avoiding congestion with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety. Moving DOWN gets me to (0,4), from where I can move RIGHT to the apple at (1,4) in the subsequent turn, assuming it is still there and safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by any enemy snake body. It is not occupied by the enemy head. Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (2, 3), DOWN to (2, 1), and RIGHT to (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples.

This moves away from the apple.\n\nMoving UP towards (2, 7) seems optimal based on distance. However, let's check the path. If I move to (2, 3), the next step towards (2, 7) would be (2, 4). Looking at the enemy body positions, (2, 4) is occupied by enemy snake 0's body. Moving to (2, 3) is safe for this turn, but the direct path towards (2, 7) is blocked by the enemy body, severely limiting my options for the next turn from (2, 3).\n\nLet's consider the other safe moves. Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, I need to determine the best safe move based on my goal to eat apples. I will find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 7):\n- To (8, 8): |3-8| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 9): |3-8| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4, 9): |3-4| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- To (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- To (5, 0): |3-5| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, I evaluate the safe moves based on how they affect the distance to the closest apple (4, 9):\n- Move UP to (3, 8): The new position is (3, 8). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving RIGHT to (8,6) positions me at X=8, which aligns better with the X-coordinate of the apple cluster.

The apple at (8, 7) is now adjacent. I will check if moving UP to (8, 7) is safe (not occupied by the enemy or my own body segments, excluding the tail which will have moved). If safe, I will move UP to eat the apple. If not safe, I will evaluate other safe moves from (8, 6) towards the remaining apples, keeping track of the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

It is also a safe move.\n\nConsider the enemy snake at (2, 4). Its potential moves include moving LEFT to (1, 4), which is the same apple I can reach. Since I move first, I can secure this apple by moving RIGHT. If I were to move DOWN instead, the apple at (1, 4) would remain, and the enemy snake at (2, 4) would likely move LEFT to take it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, captures the closest apple, and denies it to the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving DOWN to (2, 1) moves away from the closest apple. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) also moves away from the closest apple (2, 7). However, let's check the next closest apple. The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10. Moves away.\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 2): Distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |2-9| = 1 + 7 = 8. Moves closer.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 2) is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (4, 9) and moves me away from the immediate blockade caused by the enemy body at (2, 4). This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The apple at (4, 9) is distance |2-4| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9 away from (2, 2).\n- Move DOWN to (2, 1): Distance to (4, 9) is |2-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.

This seems like a better strategy than moving into a position (2, 3) from which my path is immediately blocked.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I will continue moving towards the apple at (4, 9) as long as the path is safe and appears optimal. From (3, 2), I will evaluate moves towards (4, 9), likely prioritizing moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 6): The new position is (3, 6). The distance to (4, 9) is |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4. This move increases the distance.\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 7): The new position is (4, 7). The distance to (4, 9) is |4-4| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2. This move reduces the distance to the apple.\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT reduce the distance to the closest apple (4, 9) to 2. Both moves are equally good in terms of immediate progress towards the apple.\n\nConsidering the board layout, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) aligns my snake's head with the x-coordinate of the apple (4, 9). From (4, 7), a simple path UP to (4, 8) and then UP to (4, 9) is available, provided those squares remain safe. This path appears unobstructed by my body or the enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 8) is also a good option, leaving the snake one step away from both (4, 8) and (3, 9), which also lead towards the apple.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT to (4, 7). This aligns my x-coordinate with the target apple, setting up a clear path upwards. The square (4, 7) is currently empty and safe. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the board state from (4, 7). The closest apple will likely still be (4, 9). I will aim to move towards (4, 9), likely by moving UP, while ensuring the path is safe from self-collision and enemy snakes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."
