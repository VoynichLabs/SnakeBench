UP: (2, 6) \u2192 (2, 7)\n   - This is within bounds\n   - No body to hit\n   - Enemy head is at (3, 7). If I move to (2, 7) and enemy moves LEFT, we'd both be at (2, 7) - head-on collision!\n   - If enemy moves UP to (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 6), or RIGHT to (4, 7), I'd be safe at (2, 7)\n\n2. DOWN: (2, 6) \u2192 (2, 5)\n   - This is within bounds\n   - No body to hit\n   - No collision risk with enemy\n   - This gets me closer to the apple at (1, 5)\n\n3. LEFT: (2, 6) \u2192 (1, 6)\n   - This is within bounds\n   - No body to hit\n   - No collision risk with enemy\n   - This gets me closer to the apple at (1, 5) - I'd be directly above it\n\n4. RIGHT: (2, 6) \u2192 (3, 6)\n   - This is within bounds\n   - No body to hit\n   - Enemy head is at (3, 7). If enemy moves DOWN to (3, 6), we'd collide!\n   - This could be risky\n\nLet me think about the nearest apples:\n- (1, 5) is closest: I'm at (2, 6), so it's 1 left and 1 down = 2 moves away\n- (1, 1) is at distance 1 + 5 = 6 moves\n- (7, 8) is at distance 5 + 2 = 7 moves\n- (8, 4) and (9, 4) are further\n\nThe apple at (1, 5) is the closest. To get there:\n- I could go LEFT to (1, 6), then DOWN to (1, 5)\n- Or DOWN to (2, 5), then LEFT to (1, 5)\n\nLet me think about what the enemy might do:\n- Enemy is at (3, 7)\n- Closest apple to enemy is (7, 8) at distance 4 + 1 = 5\n- Or (1, 5) at distance 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe enemy might go for (1, 5) too! If enemy goes LEFT to (2, 7), then continues toward (1, 5)...\n\nActually, let me recalculate:\n- Enemy at (3, 7) to apple at (1, 5): |3-1| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves\n- Enemy at (3, 7) to apple at (7, 8): |3-7| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves\n\nSo the enemy might also target (1, 5).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 5), I'm one move away from (1, 5) and can get there next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 6), I'm also one move away from (1, 5).\n\nLet me think about collision risks:\n- UP to (2, 7): Risk if enemy goes LEFT to (2, 7)\n- RIGHT to (3, 6): Risk if enemy goes DOWN to (3, 6)\n- DOWN to (2, 5): Safe from enemy (enemy can't reach (2, 5) in one move from (3, 7))\n- LEFT to (1, 6): Safe from enemy (enemy can't reach (1, 6) in one move from (3, 7))\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe and get me closer to the apple at (1, 5).\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because:\n1. It puts me directly above the apple\n2. It moves me further from the enemy head\n3. I can then go DOWN to get the apple\n\nLet me go with LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. This turn: LEFT to (1, 6)\n2. Next turn: DOWN to (1, 5) to collect the apple\n3. Then consider going to (1, 1) which is 4 moves down from (1, 5)\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (2, 6) and the enemy is at (3, 7).\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n- **UP** to (2, 7): Risky - if enemy moves LEFT, we'd collide head-on at (2, 7)\n- **DOWN** to (2, 5): Safe, gets me closer to apple at (1, 5)\n- **LEFT** to (1, 6): Safe, puts me directly above apple at (1, 5)\n- **RIGHT** to (3, 6): Risky - if enemy moves DOWN, we'd collide at (3, 6)\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 5), which is just 2 moves away. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe moves that bring me closer to it.\n\nGoing LEFT puts me at (1, 6), directly above the apple. Next turn I can simply move DOWN to collect it. This also moves me further from the enemy snake, reducing collision risk.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (1, 6)\n2. Next turn: DOWN to (1, 5) to collect the apple\n3. After that: Head down toward apple at (1, 1) - it's a straight path down\n\nLEFT",

And going RIGHT puts me on path to it.\n\nBut wait, let me also consider safety and future options:\n- If I go DOWN, I have 3 options next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN)\n- If I go RIGHT, I have 3 options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) - assuming my tail moves\n- If I go LEFT, I have 2 options next turn (UP, DOWN) - limited by edge\n\nActually my tail will move since I didn't eat an apple this turn (wait, I did collect an apple last turn at (1,5), so my body is now at (1,6) which is my old head position).\n\nSince I ate an apple last turn, my snake grew. My tail is at (1, 6) and won't move away immediately... actually wait, let me re-read the state.\n\nCurrent state says:\n- Body: [(1, 6)]\n- Apples collected: 1\n\nSo my body segment is at (1, 6). When I move this turn, my head moves to the new position, and my body follows. Since I collected an apple last turn, I grew, so:\n- Before last move: head at (1, 6), no body\n- After eating apple at (1, 5): head at (1, 5), body at (1, 6)\n\nThis turn, when I move:\n- If I don't eat an apple: head moves to new position, body at (1, 6) becomes tail and follows, so body moves to (1, 5)\n- My body will vacate (1, 6) and move to where my head was (1, 5)\n\nSo if I move DOWN to (1, 4):\n- New head: (1, 4)\n- Body moves: (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 5)\n- Safe!\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 5):\n- New head: (2, 5)\n- Body moves: (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 5)\n- Safe!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 5):\n- New head: (0, 5)\n- Body moves: (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 5)\n- Safe!\n\nAll three non-UP moves are safe this turn.\n\nStrategy decision:\n- RIGHT toward (4, 5) is 3 moves to an apple\n- DOWN toward (1, 1) is 4 moves to an apple\n- LEFT is not optimal\n\nI'll go RIGHT to start heading toward (4, 5) since it's the closest apple. After collecting it, I can decide whether to go for (1, 1) or the cluster at (8, 4)/(9, 4).\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN toward (1, 1), that's also a decent path. Let me see where the enemy might go...\n\nEnemy at (3, 9) - they might go for (7, 8) which is 4 right and 1 down = 5 moves away. Or they could go for (4, 5) which is 1 right and 4 down = 5 moves away.\n\nIf enemy goes for (4, 5), they'd need to go down. Let me see... from (3, 9):\n- To (4, 5): needs to go right 1 and down 4, so 5 moves total\n- From my position (1, 5): to (4, 5) is right 3, so 3 moves\n\nI can reach (4, 5) faster than the enemy! So going RIGHT makes sense.\n\nLet me also check: from (1, 5) to (4, 5):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) - apple!\n\nYes, 3 moves. The enemy would need 5 moves minimum to reach (4, 5).\n\nMy decision: RIGHT to head toward (4, 5).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 5)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (3, 5)\n3. Turn after: RIGHT to (4, 5) - collect apple!\n4. Then head DOWN toward (8, 4)/(9, 4) cluster or back to (1, 1)\n\nActually, let me reconsider the path to avoid being trapped. Going right 3 times in a row...\n\nAfter this turn (if I go RIGHT):\n- Head at (2, 5)\n- Body at (1, 5)\n\nNext turn options from (2, 5):\n- UP to (2, 6) - safe\n- DOWN to (2, 4) - safe\n- RIGHT to (3, 5) - safe, continues toward apple\n- LEFT to (1, 5) - that's where my body will be, so I can't go back\n\nSo I have 3 options next turn. Good.\n\nI'll go RIGHT.\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\nMy head is at (1, 5) with my body at (1, 6) after collecting the apple last turn.\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): DEATH - this is where my body segment is! Cannot go backwards.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Safe - moves toward apple at (1, 1) which is 4 moves away\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): Safe but puts me at edge, limiting options\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Safe - moves toward apple at (4, 5) which is only 3 moves away!\n\nChecking enemy position:\n- Enemy at (3, 9) is far away, likely heading toward (7, 8)\n- No collision risk this turn\n\nApple distance comparison:\n- (4, 5): 3 moves right from my position - closest!\n- (1, 1): 4 moves down\n- (7, 8), (8, 4), (9, 4): Much farther\n\nI can reach (4, 5) in 3 moves while the enemy needs at least 5 moves to get there from (3, 9). This is the optimal target.\n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (2, 5)\n2. Next: RIGHT to (3, 5)\n3. Next: RIGHT to (4, 5) - collect apple!\n4. After: Head toward (8, 4)/(9, 4) cluster or (1, 1) depending on enemy position\n\nRIGHT",
