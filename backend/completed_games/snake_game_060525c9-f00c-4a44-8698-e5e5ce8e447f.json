        "1": {
          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's start by understanding the current situation. My snake is at position (1,9) with a body at (0,9). The apples are at (2,8), (5,5), (7,0), (0,3), and (5,0). I have collected one apple already. The enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (8,0) with no body. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate all possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (1,9) would take me to (2,9). Is that safe? The body is at (0,9), so moving right is not directly into my own body. But I need to check if (2,9) is occupied by any other snake. The enemy is at (8,0), so no. Also, not outside the board. So RIGHT seems safe here.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left from (1,9) to (0,9). But that cell is exactly my body. Since moving into my own body, including backwards, is a loss. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n3. **UP**: Moving up from (1,9) would take me to (1,10), which is outside the board (since y ranges from 0 to 9). So UP is invalid.\n\n4. **DOWN**: Moving down to (1,8). Is that safe? The apple at (2,8) is there, but my head would move to (1,8), which is adjacent. Check if (1,8) is occupied. The enemy isn't there, and my body is at (0,9). So (1,8) is empty. So DOWN is safe.\n\nSo the possible moves are RIGHT and DOWN. LEFT and UP are invalid.\n\nNow, between RIGHT and DOWN, which is better?\n\nLooking at apples: The closest apple is (2,8) which is to the right and one down from my current head. If I move RIGHT to (2,9), then next turn, maybe DOWN to (2,8) to get the apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (1,8), then maybe RIGHT to (2,8). But the apple is at (2,8), so moving RIGHT first would get me closer in x, but y is still 9. \n\nBut also, need to consider future moves. If I move DOWN first, I get to (1,8), which is one step away from the apple. Then next turn, I could move RIGHT to get the apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT now would take me to (2,9), then next turn maybe DOWN to (2,8). \n\nBut also, need to check if there's any risk of collision. The enemy is at (8,0), which is far away. So movement towards the apple might be better. \n\nAnother factor: moving RIGHT now could set up a better path. But maybe moving DOWN first is better to position for the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now might take me into a position where next turn I can collect the apple. But the apple is at (2,8), so from (2,9), moving DOWN would get me there. So moving RIGHT now is one step towards that. \n\nBut also, need to avoid getting stuck. Let's see the current body positions. My body is at (0,9). If I move RIGHT to (2,9), then my new body will be the previous head (1,9), which is now the body. So next move, if I go DOWN, the path would be (2,9) -> (2,8) which is the apple. That seems good. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (1,8) first. Then next turn, maybe RIGHT to (2,8) to get the apple. \n\nSo both directions are possible. But which is better? \n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (2,8) is one step away in x and two steps in y. If I move RIGHT now, I can then move DOWN next turn. But if I move DOWN now, I can then move RIGHT next turn. Either way, it's two moves. But maybe moving RIGHT first is better because the x-coordinate is closer. \n\nBut also, need to check if moving RIGHT now would leave me in a position where next turn I have more options. For example, after moving RIGHT to (2,9), next turn I can move DOWN, LEFT, or UP (but UP would be out of bounds). So two options. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (1,8), next turn I can move RIGHT, LEFT (but LEFT would go back to (0,8), which is not occupied), or UP (to (1,9), which is my previous head position. Wait, my body after moving DOWN would be [(1,9)] as the new body. So if I move UP next, that would be into my own body (since the new head would be (1,9), and the body is (1,9) from previous move? Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nWhen I move, the head moves, and the body follows. So after moving DOWN to (1,8), the body would be the previous head (1,9). So next turn, if I move UP from (1,8), that would take me to (1,9), which is my own body. That's a collision, so that's invalid. So after moving DOWN, moving UP would be into my own body. So that's bad. \n\nTherefore, after moving DOWN, possible directions would be RIGHT or LEFT. If I move RIGHT to (2,8), that's the apple. That's good. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT first to (2,9), then next turn can move DOWN to (2,8) (apple) or LEFT to (1,9) (but that's my previous position, but after moving, the body would be (1,9) and (2,9). So moving LEFT would take me to (1,9), which is part of the body. Wait, no. Let me clarify. \n\nWhen I move RIGHT from (1,9) to (2,9), the body becomes [(1,9)]. Then next turn, if I move LEFT, the head would go to (1,9), which is part of the body. So that's invalid. So after moving RIGHT, the next possible moves would be DOWN or UP (but UP is out of bounds). So only DOWN is safe. \n\nSo moving RIGHT now allows me to go DOWN next turn to get the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN now to (1,8), then next turn can move RIGHT to (2,8) (apple). \n\nSo both directions lead to the same apple in two moves. So which is better? \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's closer to the apple in x, and the apple is at (2,8). So moving RIGHT now would take me to x=2, which is the same x as the apple. Then next turn, moving DOWN to y=8. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first would take me to (1,8), then next turn moving RIGHT to (2,8). \n\nEither way, same number of steps. But maybe moving RIGHT first is better because it's a direct step towards the apple's x-coordinate. \n\nBut also, need to check if there are other apples. The apple at (5,5) is further away, but maybe after getting (2,8), I can proceed towards that. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy is at (8,0). If I move towards the bottom (down), maybe I can avoid any collision. But the enemy is far away. \n\nAlso, the move should maximize future options. If I move RIGHT, then next turn I can only move DOWN. If I move DOWN, next turn I can move RIGHT or LEFT. \n\nWait, after moving DOWN to (1,8), the body is [(1,9)]. So next move, if I go RIGHT to (2,8), that's safe. If I go LEFT to (0,8), that's empty. So two options. \n\nSo moving DOWN now gives more flexibility. \n\nBut the apple is at (2,8). So moving RIGHT first gets me closer in x. \n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is better because it allows me to have more options next turn. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is better because it's a direct step towards the apple. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (0,3) is above me. But moving up is invalid. So not relevant. \n\nThe apple at (5,0) is at the bottom. Maybe after collecting (2,8), I can head towards lower y. \n\nBut for this turn, the immediate apple is (2,8). \n\nSo between RIGHT and DOWN. \n\nWhich move is safer? Both are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better because it's a direct step towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN might be better to avoid any potential issues. \n\nWait, but moving RIGHT would take me to (2,9). Then next turn, moving DOWN to (2,8) would collect the apple. That's two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN now, then next turn I can move RIGHT to (2,8). Also two moves. \n\nSo same distance. \n\nBut maybe the direction that allows me to have more options in the future. \n\nAlternatively, if I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can only move DOWN (since LEFT would be into my body). But if I move DOWN now, next turn I can move RIGHT or LEFT. \n\nSo moving DOWN now might give more flexibility. \n\nBut the goal is to collect apples. So getting to (2,8) as soon as possible is better. \n\nIf I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN. So two moves. \n\nIf I move DOWN now, then next turn I can move RIGHT. Also two moves. \n\nSo same. \n\nBut maybe moving RIGHT is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of collision. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,0). If I move DOWN, I'm moving towards the bottom. The enemy is at (8,0), so maybe they might move towards me? But since they are a single segment, their movement is unknown. \n\nBut since the enemy's head is at (8,0), and they have no body, their possible moves could be anything. But since they are not interacting with me directly, maybe it's not a concern. \n\nSo between the two, I need to choose. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (2,8) is one step away in x and one step down. So moving RIGHT then DOWN is two steps. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN then RIGHT is also two steps. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nBut I need to make sure that after moving, I can still collect the apple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better because it's a safer path. \n\nWait, but both are safe. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving RIGHT, my head is at (2,9). Then next turn, moving DOWN to (2,8) would collect the apple. \n\nIf I move DOWN now to (1,8), then next turn moving RIGHT to (2,8) would collect the apple. \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT first is better because it's a direct step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk of the enemy moving into my path. But since the enemy is at (8,0), and I'm moving towards (2,8), it's not directly conflicting. \n\nSo, considering all factors, both moves are valid. But I need to choose one. \n\nThe problem says to prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves. \n\nIf I move RIGHT now, next turn I can only move DOWN (since LEFT would be into my body). \n\nIf I move DOWN now, next turn I can move RIGHT or LEFT. \n\nSo moving DOWN now gives more options next turn. \n\nTherefore, moving DOWN might be better for flexibility. \n\nBut the goal is to collect apples. So maybe it's better to move towards the apple. \n\nBut since both paths lead to the apple in two moves, but moving DOWN allows more options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother angle: the current position is (1,9). The apple is at (2,8). So moving RIGHT then DOWN is the path. \n\nIf I move RIGHT now, then next turn I can move DOWN. \n\nIf I move DOWN now, then next turn I can move RIGHT. \n\nEither way, same. \n\nBut maybe moving RIGHT first is better because it's a direct approach. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first might be better to avoid getting into a position where next turn I can't move. \n\nWait, after moving DOWN to (1,8), the body is [(1,9)]. So next turn, moving LEFT would be to (0,8), which is empty. So that's a valid move. \n\nSo having that option could be useful. \n\nBut since the immediate goal is to get the apple, maybe moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,8) is the only one in that area. \n\nIn terms of strategy, I should prioritize getting the apple. \n\nSo between the two, I think moving RIGHT is better because it's a step towards the apple. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is safer. \n\nWait, let's think about the body. If I move RIGHT to (2,9), then the next move's body is (1,9). So if I then move DOWN to (2,8), that's safe. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (1,8), then next move can be RIGHT to (2,8). \n\nEither way, same result. \n\nBut perhaps moving RIGHT is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a long-term plan. \n\nThe long-term plan could be to collect the apple at (2,8) first, then proceed towards other apples. \n\nSo for this turn, moving RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nBut since the apple is at (2,8), moving RIGHT first gets me closer. \n\nSo I think the best move is RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the last move was RIGHT. The last rational was RIGHT. Maybe the same move is good. \n\nBut I need to check if moving RIGHT again is safe. \n\nYes, as discussed earlier. \n\nSo the answer is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next. So, I'm controlling Snake 1, and the board state is given. The last move was to the RIGHT, which makes sense because the current head is at (3,8). If the last move was RIGHT, then moving right again would take the head to (4,8). But wait, looking at the board, there's an apple at (9,8). But that's a ways off. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are at (5,5), (0,3), (3,0), (9,8), (3,3). The snake's current position is head at (3,8), body (2,8), (2,9). So the snake is moving to the right, so the head is at x=3, y=8. The last move was RIGHT, which took the head from (2,8) to (3,8). Now, what's the next move?\n\nThe goal is to collect apples. The closest apple to the head is (3,3) and (5,5). But (3,3) is two steps away, but considering the snake's body, moving down would take us closer. Wait, but the snake's body is at (2,8), (2,9). So if the head moves down to (3,7), but that's not a body part. Wait, the body is [(2,8), (2,9)]. So the head is at (3,8). If I move down (y decreases), then next head would be (3,7). That's a safe move? Let me check.\n\nFirst, eliminate any move that would kill me. Let's check each direction.\n\nUp: moving up would take head to (3,9). But the body is at (2,9). So moving up would go to (3,9), which is not part of the body. Wait, the body is [(2,8), (2,9)]. So (3,9) is not part of the body. So up is possible. But need to check if that's on the board. Y=9 is the top, so yes. So up is possible.\n\nDown: (3,7). Not on board, so safe.\n\nLeft: (2,8). But that's the first body segment. So moving left would put the head into (2,8), which is the body. So that's invalid. So left is out.\n\nRight: (4,8). Check if that's on the board. X=4 is within 0-9. So right is possible. But need to check if any other snakes are there. The enemy snake's head is at (5,0), body at (6,0), (7,0). So (4,8) is empty. So right is possible.\n\nSo possible moves are up, down, right. Left is invalid.\n\nNow, among these, which is better. The apples are at (5,5), (0,3), (3,0), (9,8), (3,3). The closest apple is (3,3) which is 5 steps down. (5,5) is 2 steps right and 3 steps down. (9,8) is 6 steps right. So (3,3) is the closest. So moving down would get closer to (3,3). But also, moving down might keep options open.\n\nBut also, considering the enemy snakes. The enemy snake is at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). So they are on the bottom row. So moving down might not interfere with them. But if I move up, that's moving towards the top. The apple at (9,8) is on the right side, top middle. Maybe moving right could be a path towards that. But the head is at (3,8). Moving right would take it to (4,8), then (5,8), etc. But the apple at (9,8) is at x=9, y=8. So moving right would get closer, but it's a long way. However, maybe that's a good direction to go.\n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (3,3) might be better. But the snake's body is at (2,8) and (2,9). So moving down from (3,8) to (3,7) doesn't interfere with the body. So that's safe.\n\nBut also, need to consider future moves. If I go down, then next move could be down again, but maybe that's not the best. Alternatively, moving up might not be useful. Let me think about the apples. The apple at (3,3) is directly below the current head. So moving down would get closer. But the snake's body is at (2,8), (2,9). So moving down to (3,7) is safe. Then next move could be down again, but need to make sure not to hit any bodies.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that if I move right, I can get towards (5,5) or (9,8). But (5,5) is at (5,5). From (3,8), moving right to (4,8), then down to 5,5. But that's two moves. Alternatively, moving down to (3,7), then right, etc.\n\nAlso, need to check if moving in a direction that allows more future moves. For example, moving right might open up more directions, but if there's a dead end, that's bad.\n\nAnother factor: the enemy snake is moving. They are at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). So their head is at (5,0). If they move in a direction, maybe they could come into our path. But since they are on the bottom, and we're moving around the upper part, maybe not immediately a threat. However, if we move down, maybe we could get into their path. But their movement is unknown. Wait, the enemy's last move is not given, but their current position is head at (5,0). So they might be moving in some direction. But since we don't know their next move, it's hard to predict. So maybe we should focus on our own moves.\n\nSo, the options are up, down, right. Let's evaluate each:\n\nUp: (3,9). That's a new position. No apple there. But maybe it's a safe spot. But we have an apple at (9,8) which is on the same y-level. So moving right could be better. But up might not be useful.\n\nDown: (3,7). Closer to (3,3). Also, maybe leads to other apples. But maybe there's a wall or other snakes. But in the current board, there's nothing there.\n\nRight: (4,8). Closer to (9,8) apple. But that's 5 steps away. But maybe moving right is a good direction to go towards that apple.\n\nBut which is better? The apple at (3,3) is closer. So moving down would get us there faster. But if we go down, then next move could be down again, but need to check if that's safe. Alternatively, moving right might allow us to go towards (5,5) or (9,8).\n\nBut also, the apple at (3,3) is in the same x-coordinate as the head. So moving down would get us there. So maybe that's a good target.\n\nAnother thing: the snake's body is [(2,8), (2,9)]. So if we move down, the new head is (3,7). The body would then be [(3,8), (2,8)]. Wait, no. When the snake moves, each part follows the previous. So when the head moves down to (3,7), the next body segment would be the previous head (3,8), then the previous body segment (2,8). So the new body would be [(3,8), (2,8)]. So that's safe, as long as none of those positions are occupied by other snakes. The enemy is at (5,0), so no conflict.\n\nSo moving down is safe. Similarly, moving right to (4,8) is safe.\n\nNow, considering the apples, (3,3) is two steps down from the head. So if we move down twice, we can reach it. But each move is one step. So moving down once gets us to (3,7), then next move down to (3,6), etc. But maybe that's a path.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (4,8) could be a way to go towards (5,5) or (9,8). But (5,5) is 3 steps down and 1 step right. So from (4,8), moving down to 5,8, then left to 5,7, etc. But that's more steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (4,8) and then down to (4,7), then down to (4,6), etc. Maybe that's a longer path but could lead to (5,5) or (9,8).\n\nBut which direction is better? The apple at (3,3) is closer, so maybe moving down is better. However, if we can collect that apple, that's +1 point. Similarly, the apple at (9,8) is further but maybe more points if we can get there.\n\nBut the snake's current apples are 2. The other snake has 2 as well. So we need to collect more apples to win.\n\nAnother thing: if we move down, we might be moving towards the apple at (3,3), but also need to check if that path is clear. Also, after collecting that apple, the snake would grow by 1 segment. So the body would be longer. But as long as we don't hit our own body, that's okay.\n\nBut moving down to (3,7) is safe. Then next move could be down again. But maybe there's a risk of being trapped. However, the board is 10x10, so there's space.\n\nAlternatively, moving right might be better for the long term. For example, moving towards (9,8) could be a larger apple, but it's further. However, if we can get there, that's a good apple. But the path might be blocked by other snakes or the edge.\n\nWait, the board has an T at (0,3) and (3,0), (9,8). So (9,8) is an apple. So moving right would take us towards that. But (9,8) is at x=9, y=8. From (3,8), moving right 6 times would get there. But that's a long path. However, if we can go that way, maybe it's better.\n\nBut considering that the enemy snake is at (5,0), maybe they are not in our path. So moving right is possible.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's think about the immediate next steps. If we move down, we get closer to (3,3). If we move right, we get closer to (9,8) or (5,5).\n\nBut also, the move should leave us with as many options as possible. For example, moving down might leave us with more options in the future. If we move right, maybe we can then go down or up.\n\nBut the problem is that after moving, the body segments follow. So after moving right, the body would be [(3,8), (2,8)]. Then next move, if we go right again, the head is (5,8), body [(4,8), (3,8)]. That's safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (3,7), body becomes [(3,8), (2,8)]. Then next move could be down again, or right, etc.\n\nBut the key is to choose the move that maximizes the chances of getting apples and avoiding death.\n\nAnother point: the enemy snake's head is at (5,0). If they move up, they might come into our path. But since they are on the bottom, unless they move up a lot, it's unlikely. But we can't be sure. However, our current position is at (3,8), which is far from them.\n\nSo, considering all that, moving down towards (3,3) seems like a good option. But also, moving right could be a way to get to (9,8). But which is more urgent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right is better because (9,8) is an apple, and if we can reach it, that's a good gain. But the distance is large. However, if we move right, we can also proceed towards (5,5) by moving down later.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate next step. Let's see, the current head is at (3,8). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,9) \u2013 no apple here. But safe.\n\n- Down: (3,7) \u2013 closer to (3,3) apple.\n\n- Right: (4,8) \u2013 no apple here, but closer to (9,8).\n\n- Left is invalid.\n\nSo, among these, moving down or right. Which is better?\n\nIf we move down, we can collect (3,3) in two moves. But if we move right, we can start moving towards (9,8) or (5,5). However, (5,5) is at (5,5). From (4,8), moving down to (4,5) would take 3 steps. So maybe that's a possible path.\n\nBut maybe moving down is more direct. However, the apple at (3,3) is in the same column. So moving down is a straight path. That's efficient.\n\nBut also, the apple at (3,3) is at y=3, which is lower. So moving down would get us there. So if we move down, then next move could be down again, then again, etc. But need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving right could allow us to move towards (5,5) or (9,8). But (5,5) is at (5,5). From (4,8), moving down to (4,5) would take 3 steps. But that's possible.\n\nBut which direction is better? It's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the apple at (3,3) is closer, moving down might be better to collect that apple first.\n\nBut wait, the snake has already collected 2 apples. The other snake also has 2. So collecting one more would make it 3, which is still not enough. But maybe the other apples are more valuable. However, the game ends when someone reaches 30, which is way more than 2. But since the game can last up to 150 turns, it's possible to collect more.\n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect apples. So moving towards the closest apple (3,3) is a good strategy.\n\nBut another thing: when moving down, the head would be at (3,7). Then the next move could be down again to (3,6), etc. But maybe there's a risk of getting blocked. However, the board seems clear in that area.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (4,8) could be a way to avoid getting stuck. But I think moving down is better here.\n\nWait, but the last move was RIGHT. So the previous position was (2,8) -> (3,8). So the next move could be right again, but that's (4,8). But maybe that's a good direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy snake is moving in a way that could interfere. But since their head is at (5,0), which is far away, it's unlikely.\n\nSo, considering all factors, moving down to (3,7) seems safer and closer to the (3,3) apple. But I need to check if any other snakes are in that path. The enemy's body is at (6,0), (7,0), so no. So down is safe.\n\nBut another consideration: after moving down, the snake's body will follow. So the next body segments would be (3,8) and (2,8). So if we move down again, the head would be (3,6), body (3,7), (3,8). That's safe.\n\nSo, moving down seems like a good choice. But maybe moving right is also possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right is better for future options. For example, if we move right, we can then go down or up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (9,8) is on the same y-coordinate as the current head. So moving right could be a way to go towards that. But that's 5 steps. However, if we can collect that apple, it's a good one. But it's a long way.\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to go down towards (3,3). So the answer would be DOWN.\n\nWait, but let me check if moving down is safe. The head is at (3,8). Moving down to (3,7). The body is [(2,8), (2,9)]. So (3,7) is not part of the body. So that's safe. Also, no other snakes are there. So yes, down is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) given the current board state and the rules.\n\nMy snake's head is at (5,5), and the body is [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]. The last move was RIGHT, which makes sense because moving right from (5,5) would have gone to (6,5), but wait, the current head is (5,5). Wait, maybe I need to check the previous move. The last move was RIGHT, so the previous head position would have been (4,5), then moving right to (5,5). That's correct because the previous head was (4,5), and moving right leads to (5,5). So the current head is (5,5).\n\nThe apples on the board are at (0,3), (9,8), (6,2), (5,4), and (1,0). My snake has already collected 3 apples and has 3 segments. So I'm looking for the next apple to collect.\n\nFirst, check possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's evaluate each move:\n\n1. **UP**: From (5,5), moving up to (5,6). But wait, the current body includes (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). So moving up to (5,6) would check if that's in the body. The body after moving would be [(5,5) (new head), then the previous head (5,5) becomes the first body part, but wait, the movement is simultaneous. Wait, no. When moving, the head moves, and each body segment follows. So after moving, the new head is (5,6) if moving up. Then the body would be [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. So moving up to (5,6) would check if (5,6) is occupied by any other snake. The board state shows:\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nLine 5: (5,5) is the head. Line 6 (y=5 is row 5? Wait, the coordinates are (x,y) with y increasing upwards. Wait, the board is displayed with line 0 at the bottom. So line 0 is y=0, line 1 is y=1, up to line 9 is y=9. So the board as given:\n\nLine 9: y=9 (top), line 0: y=0 (bottom).\n\nSo the board display:\n\nLine 9: 9 . . . . . . . . . . (x from 0-9)\nLine 8: 8 . . . . . . . . . A (apple at (9,8))\nLine 7: 7 . . . . . . . . . .\nLine 6: 6 . . . T T . . . . . (T's are probably tail segments? Or maybe obstacles? Wait, the board state might show the T's as parts of the snakes. The user's snake is ID 1, and the enemy is snake 0. The snake 0's head is at (3,3), body [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So in line 3 (y=3), x=3 is H, x=4 is part of snake 0's body. Similarly, in line 6 (y=6), there are T's at (5,6) and (5,7)? Wait, the board for line 6 is \"6 . . . T T . . . . .\", so x=4 and x=5 at y=6 are T's. Are those part of the snakes? Maybe T represents the tail of snake 0. Let me check the coordinates. Snake 0's body includes (3,0), (4,0) at y=0. So maybe the T's are part of other snakes. But perhaps the T's are not part of the snakes that are alive. Wait, the enemy snakes are listed as snake 0. So maybe the T's are part of the game's obstacles or maybe other elements. But I need to check if moving into those cells is safe.\n\nWait, the rules say that if the head moves into any part of any snake's body (including own), you die. So I need to check for each direction if the new head position is in any snake's body or head.\n\nSo for each move direction, the new head position must not be:\n\n- Off the board (x or y not 0-9)\n- In any snake's body (including my own)\n- In another snake's head (since all move simultaneously, but during the move, if two heads collide, both die)\n\nSo for each direction:\n\nPossible moves:\n\nCurrent head at (5,5).\n\nPossible new positions:\n\nUP: (5,6)\nDOWN: (5,4)\nLEFT: (4,5)\nRIGHT: (6,5)\n\nCheck each for safety.\n\nFirst, check if any of these positions are off the board. All are within 0-9 for x and y. So safe in that aspect.\n\nNext, check if the new head position is in any snake's body (including own).\n\nMy own body (before moving) is [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]. So after moving, my head will be new position, and my body will be the previous head and body parts shifted. But during the move, the collision check is against the current state (before moving). Wait, no. Because all snakes move at the same time. So when determining if a move is safe, we have to check if the new head position (after moving) collides with any part of any snake's body (including their current positions, or their new positions? Because all move at the same time. This is a critical point.\n\nThe rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So during the move, the new head position is checked against all other snakes' bodies (including their new positions after moving, because all move simultaneously. Wait, but how does that work? For example, if two snakes move into the same cell, their heads collide. But for body collisions, perhaps the check is against the previous positions, or the new positions?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But according to the rules, it's likely that the collision is checked against the new positions. Because all snakes move at the same time. So for example, if snake A moves into a cell that snake B's new head is moving into, then both die. Similarly, if my new head moves into a cell that another snake's new body is in, then I die.\n\nBut the problem is that during the move decision, we have to predict where all other snakes will move. But since we don't know their moves yet, we have to make assumptions. However, in the decision process, we can only base our move on the current positions of other snakes, unless we have information about their possible moves.\n\nIn this case, the enemy snake (snake 0) is at head (3,3), body [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So their positions are known. But snake 0's move is unknown. So when evaluating possible moves, we have to assume that snake 0 could move in any direction, and thus their new positions could vary. Therefore, for safety, we need to check if our new head position could possibly collide with snake 0's possible new positions.\n\nBut since we can't predict their moves exactly, perhaps the safest approach is to avoid any positions that are currently occupied by any part of any snake's body, or their heads, because even if they move, their current positions are part of their body after movement. Wait, no. Because when they move, their entire body shifts. For example, if snake 0 moves UP, their new head would be (3,4), and their body would be [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]. So their previous body parts are now shifted. So during the collision check, we need to consider all possible new positions of other snakes. But since we don't know their moves, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the collision is checked against the positions after all snakes have moved. So for example, if my new head is (5,6), and snake 0's new head is (3,4), and their body parts are (3,3), (3,2), etc., then my head is not colliding with any of snake 0's new positions. But if snake 0 moves in a way that their body part ends up at (5,6), then that would be a collision. However, since we can't know their move, we have to make an assumption. The safest approach is to avoid any positions that are currently occupied by any snake's body or head, except for the fact that they might move away. But since we can't know, perhaps we have to consider that if our move leads to a position that is currently occupied by any snake's body (including their current positions), then that's a collision. But that's not accurate because other snakes might move out of those positions. However, given that we can't predict their moves, perhaps the safest assumption is to treat their current positions as possible collision points unless we can be certain they will move away.\n\nThis is a bit complex. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, check each possible direction for safety.\n\nMy own body is [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]. So if I move in a direction, my new head will be that direction's cell. Then, the new body will be [previous head, previous body parts except last]. So for each direction:\n\n1. UP: new head (5,6). Check if (5,6) is in any snake's body (current or future?).\n\nCurrent snake 0's body is [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. Their head is (3,3). So their current positions are head (3,3) and body parts. If snake 0 moves UP, their new head is (3,4), and body becomes [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]. So (5,6) is not in snake 0's new positions. However, if snake 0 moves in a direction that causes their body to reach (5,6), that's possible but unlikely. Since we can't know, perhaps we can't assume that. So for safety, we should check if (5,6) is currently part of any snake's body. Looking at the board:\n\nLooking at the board state, line 6 (y=6) has T's at x=4 and x=5. Wait, line 6 in the board is \"6 . . . T T . . . . .\", so x=4 and x=5 at y=6 are T's. Are those part of any snake? The user's snake is ID 1, and the enemy is snake 0. The T's might be part of snake 0's body. Wait, snake 0's body includes (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0). So at y=6, there are T's but they are not part of snake 0. Maybe those are other elements, like maybe previous positions or something else. But according to the problem statement, the board state is given, and the apples are marked with A. The T's might be part of the game's obstacles or maybe other snakes. But since the problem only mentions snakes 0 and 1, perhaps the T's are not part of any snake. So moving into (5,6) would be safe in terms of other snakes' bodies, unless snake 0 moves into that position. But since we can't know, perhaps we have to assume that (5,6) is safe unless it's in the current positions of other snakes' bodies.\n\nWait, the current snake 0's body is [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So their current positions are (3,3) (head), and the body parts. So (5,6) is not part of snake 0's current body. So moving UP to (5,6) would not collide with snake 0's current body. However, if snake 0 moves in a way that their body ends up at (5,6), that's possible. But since we can't predict their move, perhaps we have to consider that as a risk. But given that the decision process requires us to eliminate moves that would immediately kill us, perhaps we can only check current positions. Because if a snake's current body is in a position that we might move into, but they move away, then it's not a collision. However, during the collision check, it's possible that the new position of our head could coincide with the new positions of other snakes. But since we can't know their moves, perhaps the safest approach is to check against current positions. Alternatively, maybe the collision is checked based on the new positions after all snakes have moved. But without knowing their moves, we can't compute that. Therefore, perhaps the collision check is based on the current positions of all snakes. That would make sense for the initial move decision. So for each possible move, check if the new head position is in any snake's current body (including their own) or head. But that's not entirely accurate, but given the information we have, that's the best we can do.\n\nSo for each direction:\n\nCheck if new head position is:\n\n- Off the board: no for all directions here.\n\n- In any snake's current body (including own) or head.\n\nMy own current body: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]. So:\n\nUP: (5,6) is not in own body.\n\nDOWN: (5,4) is not in own body.\n\nLEFT: (4,5) is in own body (current body has (4,5) as the first body part). So moving LEFT would make the new head (4,5), which is part of the current body. So that's a collision. Therefore, LEFT is invalid.\n\nRIGHT: (6,5). Check if that's in any snake's current body. Snake 0's current body is [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So (6,5) is not in any snake's body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo LEFT is invalid because it's into own body. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check for each of these:\n\nUP: (5,6). Check if any other snake's current body includes this. Snake 0's current body is [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So (5,6) is not in snake 0's body. So UP is safe in terms of current positions. However, if snake 0 moves in a way that their body part ends up here, but we can't know. So perhaps UP is a possible move.\n\nDOWN: (5,4). Check if this is in any snake's current body. Snake 0's body is at (3,3), (3,2), etc. (5,4) is not part of their current body. So DOWN is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (6,5). Same as above, not in any current body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all three moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are possible. Now, need to evaluate which is best.\n\nNext step: among these, prefer moves that allow eating apples and keep future options open.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\nAvailable apples: (0,3), (9,8), (6,2), (5,4), (1,0).\n\nMy snake's head is at (5,5). Let's see which apples are reachable in one move.\n\n(5,4) is directly below the head. So moving DOWN would reach (5,4), which is an apple. So DOWN would collect that apple. That's a good option because it gives +1 point and increases the snake's length.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,6) is not an apple. RIGHT to (6,5) is not an apple. So DOWN is the only move that collects an apple. That's a strong candidate.\n\nBut need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The new position is (5,4). Are there any snakes (current positions) there? Snake 0's body is at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,0). So (5,4) is empty. So moving DOWN is safe. So that's a good move.\n\nBut wait, after moving DOWN, the new body would be [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. So the body parts are previous head and body. So the new head is (5,4), which is an apple. So that's good.\n\nBut what about future moves? For example, after collecting the apple, the snake grows. But the main thing is to collect the apple now.\n\nSo DOWN seems like a good choice. However, need to check if there are any other factors.\n\nAnother consideration: avoiding head-on collisions. Since we can't predict enemy moves, but if enemy snake 0 is moving towards us, that could be a problem. But since we don't know their move, perhaps we can't account for that. However, the decision process says to avoid likely head-on collisions. So maybe we should consider possible enemy moves.\n\nSnake 0's current head is (3,3). Their body is [(3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. So their current direction is DOWN, since the head is (3,3) and the next body part is (3,2). So their last move was DOWN. But since they are moving again, their next move could be in any direction. But perhaps their movement is towards collecting apples. Snake 0 has 4 apples, so they might be moving towards another apple. However, without knowing their strategy, it's hard to predict. But according to the rules, if their head moves into our body, they die. So if we move in a way that our new head is in a position that snake 0 could move into, that could cause a collision. But again, since we can't know their move, perhaps we have to assume that they might move in any direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe snake 0 is moving in a certain direction. But since we don't have that info, we can't assume. So perhaps the best we can do is to choose a move that maximizes our immediate gain (apple) and keeps our options open.\n\nSo moving DOWN to collect the apple at (5,4) seems beneficial. However, after moving DOWN, the new head is (5,4), and the body is [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. So the next move would have options. But for now, the immediate apple is a priority.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake's position. If they could move in a way that their head or body ends up in our path. For example, if snake 0 moves RIGHT towards (4,3), but that's not certain. Alternatively, if they move UP, their head would be (3,4), which is next to our possible DOWN move (5,4). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (6,5) might be a way to avoid potential collisions. But since there's no apple there, it's less beneficial. Unless there's a path towards other apples.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n(6,2) is two cells down from (6,5). So if we move RIGHT to (6,5), next move could be DOWN to (6,4), then DOWN again to (6,3), then DOWN to (6,2) to collect that apple. But that's two moves away. However, moving RIGHT now doesn't collect an apple but allows future progress towards (6,2). However, the immediate apple at (5,4) is closer and can be collected now.\n\nSo the trade-off is between collecting an immediate apple (DOWN) versus positioning for future apples. Since the apple at (5,4) is directly below, and moving there is safe, it's better to collect it now. Because collecting apples increases our score and length, which is important for surviving longer.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving DOWN, our new position is (5,4). The next possible moves would be from there. But for now, the immediate apple is a good target.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to collect the apple at (5,4).\nDOWN",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) in this Turn 15 of the game. The current head is at (7,3), and the body is [(7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. The apples left are at (0,3), (9,8), (1,0), (3,5), (7,4). \n\nFirst, I should evaluate each possible direction: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each one for safety and effectiveness.\n\nStarting with UP. Moving up from (7,3) would take me to (7,4). Looking at the body, the next cell after head is (7,2), which is down. So moving up would not hit the body immediately. But I need to check if (7,4) is safe. The apples include (7,4), so that's an apple. But also, need to check if other snakes are moving into that position. The enemy snake #0's head is at (2,0) with body [(3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. Their moves are not known yet, but since all snakes move simultaneously, I have to assume they might move in any direction. However, based on their current position, it's unlikely they would move to (7,4) unless that's their path. But since I can't predict their moves, maybe it's safer to assume that moving to (7,4) is possible. However, the enemy snake's body is in the lower area, so maybe not. But I should check if (7,4) is occupied by any other snake's body. The enemy snake's body is at (3,0), (4,0), etc., so no. So moving UP to (7,4) is safe. Plus, (7,4) is an apple, so eating it would give a point and grow the snake. That's a good option.\n\nNext, DOWN. From (7,3) down would be (7,2). But the body's first segment is (7,2), which is the next cell. So moving down would hit the body. That's an immediate death. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT. From (7,3) left is (6,3). The body has (6,3) as part of it. So moving left would hit the body. That's a death. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nRIGHT. From (7,3) right is (8,3). Check if that's safe. The body is [(7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. So (8,3) is not in the body. Also, check if it's an apple. The apples are at (0,3), (9,8), (1,0), (3,5), (7,4). So (8,3) is not an apple. But maybe moving right is safe. However, need to check if other snakes might move there. But again, can't predict. But the main thing is that (8,3) is not in the current body. So RIGHT is a possible move. However, moving right might not lead to an apple immediately. But maybe it's a safer direction to avoid immediate dangers.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and RIGHT. DOWN and LEFT are invalid because they hit the body.\n\nNow between UP and RIGHT. Let's think about which is better. UP leads to an apple (7,4), which is good. But after eating that apple, the snake would grow by one segment. That might be beneficial. However, after moving up, the next move would need to be considered. Alternatively, moving right to (8,3) could be a way to avoid getting stuck. But the apple at (7,4) is directly above. \n\nBut wait, the problem is that if I move up to (7,4), which is an apple, I get a point and grow. That's good. But I need to make sure that moving up is safe. Also, after moving up, the new head is (7,4), and the body would be the previous head (7,3) followed by the rest. So the body would be [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? Wait, no. When the snake moves, the head moves, and each body segment follows the previous one. So the new body after moving up would be the previous head (7,3) as the new body's first segment, then the rest. So the new body would be [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]. Wait, the original body was [(7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. So when the head moves up to (7,4), the new body would be the previous head (7,3) as the first body segment, then (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the new body is [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]. So the tail (5,4) is dropped. So moving up is safe. \n\nBut what about the enemy snake? The enemy snake's head is at (2,0), and their body is in the lower part. If they move in any direction, their head could potentially move into my body. But since all snakes move simultaneously, if the enemy snake moves into my body, they die. But if I move into their body, I die. However, in this case, moving up to (7,4) is not near the enemy's position. The enemy is in the lower left, so their movement is unlikely to affect me here. So moving up is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,3) is also safe. But (8,3) is not an apple. However, maybe moving right could lead to a path towards other apples. For example, the apple at (9,8) is in the top right. But that's far away. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle. But moving right might not be the best direction. \n\nAnother consideration is that moving up gives an immediate apple, which is good. But after that, the snake's length increases. However, the current length is 5 segments (head plus 4 body parts). Eating an apple would make it 6. That's not too bad. \n\nAlternatively, moving right might allow me to avoid a potential collision. But since the current move is the only one, and the enemy's move is unknown, it's hard to predict. \n\nAnother point: the last move was UP. The rationale was also UP. But maybe that's just the previous move. The user's last move was UP, so maybe the snake is trying to go up again. But I need to make sure that the next move is safe. \n\nWait, the last move was UP, so the previous move was moving up. Now, the current head is at (7,3). Wait, no. Let me check the board state. The board shows the current positions. The snake's head is at (7,3). The last move was UP, which would have moved the head from (7,2) to (7,3)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous move was UP. Let me think. If the last move was UP, then the previous head position would have been (7,2), and moving up to (7,3). But in the current state, the head is at (7,3). So the last move was UP, which is consistent. \n\nBut now, the next move. The possible directions are UP and RIGHT. \n\nIf I choose UP again, moving to (7,4), which is an apple. That's good. But after that, the next move would need to be considered. However, the immediate goal is to choose the best move now. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,3) is safe. But (8,3) is not an apple. However, maybe that's a better position for future moves. For example, if I move right, I might be able to approach other apples. But the apples are at (0,3), (9,8), (1,0), (3,5), (7,4). So (7,4) is directly above. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving up to (7,4) would allow me to collect that apple, which is a direct path. But after that, the snake's body would be longer, which could make future moves more constrained. However, since the current move is safe, and the apple is there, it's a good choice. \n\nBut I should also check if moving up would lead to any immediate dangers. For example, if the enemy snake's head is moving into my body. But since the enemy's head is at (2,0), moving in any direction, their head would be moving to (2,1), (2,-1) (invalid), (1,0), or (3,0). None of these are near (7,4), so it's safe. \n\nTherefore, moving up to (7,4) is a safe and beneficial move. It gives an apple, which increases the score. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,3) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. However, maybe it's better to move right to avoid getting into a position where future moves are limited. But given the current scenario, the apple is directly above, so moving up seems better. \n\nSo the best move is UP.\nUP",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the next move for my snake (ID 1) in this game. The board is 10x10, and there are apples at specific coordinates. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. \n\nFirst, let's check my current position. My head is at (5,5). The body follows from (6,5) to (7,5), then (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2). So the snake's body is mostly in the right side of the board, going down and left a bit. \n\nThe enemy snake (0) is at (0,2) with a long body stretching towards the top right. Their apples are 6 as well. \n\nThe last move was LEFT. That moved the head from where? Before that, the head was at (6,5) I think? Because after moving left, it's at (5,5). So last move was left. \n\nNow, possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLet me check each direction for safety. \n\n1. LEFT: Moving left from (5,5) would take me to (4,5). Need to check if that's safe. Are there any obstacles there? The enemy snake's body is at (0,2) and going up. Their body is up to (4,0), so (4,5) might be clear. Also, my own body is next at (6,5), which is to the right. So moving left to (4,5) seems safe. But would that hit anything else? Also, check if any enemy head is moving into my path. The enemy head is at (0,2), moving towards where? Since they can move any direction each turn, but their current direction isn't given. Hmm, but according to the last move, my last direction was LEFT. So for collision, when the enemy moves, their head moves in the direction they choose. Since I don't know their current move, I have to assume that they might move in a way that could hit me. Wait, but in the rules, enemy snakes move simultaneously. So when I choose my move, the enemy's move is also happening at the same time. So I need to consider that if any enemy's head moves into a part of my body (after movement), then they die. Conversely, if their head moves into my head's new position, that's a head-on collision. \n\nBut since I don't know the enemy's next move, I have to make assumptions. However, in the last turn, the enemy's apples are 6, same as me. Their body is quite long. Their head is at (0,2), so they might be moving towards an apple or trying to avoid me. \n\nBut for safety, I need to make sure that my next move doesn't result in my head hitting another snake's body. \n\nSo let's check each direction:\n\nLEFT: (5,5) -> (4,5). Is (4,5) safe? Check other snakes. The enemy's body is at (0,1), (1,1), up to (4,0). Their head is moving (unknown direction). So (4,5) seems empty. My own body's next segment would be (5,5) moving left to (4,5), and the next body segment is (6,5), which was the previous head. So body segments after movement would be: new head (4,5), then previous head (5,5), then (6,5), etc. So (4,5) is safe. \n\nUP: (5,5) -> (5,6). Check if that's safe. The apple at (3,5) is at y=5, x=3. So (5,6) is above. The enemy snake's head is at (0,2). If they move up, maybe towards (0,3) (apple there). So possible. But (5,6) is clear? Also, check if (5,6) is part of any snake's body. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 5: has \"A . . A . 1 T T . .\". So at x=5, y=5 is my head. The cell (5,6) would be in row 6 (since y increases up). Row 6 is \". . . . . . . T . .\", so (5,6) is empty. So moving up might be safe. \n\nDOWN: (5,5) -> (5,4). Check if that's safe. Row 4 is \". . . . . . . T . .\", so (5,4) is empty. But need to check if any snake's body is there. The enemy snake's body is in lower y (since their head is at y=2). Their body goes down to (4,0), so (5,4) is probably safe. \n\nRIGHT: (5,5) -> (6,5). But that's where my next body segment is. Because after moving right, the new head is (6,5), and the previous head was (5,5), then next is (6,5) which was already the first body segment. So moving right would cause my head to move into my own body? Because the body after moving would be [ (6,5), (5,5), ... ].\n\nWait, when you move right from (5,5) to (6,5), the body segments shift. The new body would be [ (6,5) (new head), then (5,5) (previous head), then (6,5) was part of the body before? Wait, original body is [(6,5), (7,5), ...]. So when moving right, the head moves to (6,5), and the body becomes [ (6,5) (new head), (5,5) (old head), (7,5), ... ].\n\nBut in the current move, if I move right to (6,5), which is where the next body segment is. So the new head is (6,5), and the next body segment is (5,5), which is the previous head. So the head is moving into a cell that was previously occupied by the body. But according to the rules, if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. \n\nWait, the rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So moving right would place the head at (6,5), which was part of the original body. But after moving, the body segments are shifted. Wait, let's think: when the snake moves, each segment moves into the position of the previous segment. So the body is a list where each segment follows the previous. \n\nOriginal body for me: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2)]. So the head is at (5,5). When moving right, the new head is (6,5), and the body becomes [ (6,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) ]? Wait no. Wait, the body is a list where each segment's previous position is the next segment. So when moving right, the head moves to (6,5), and the first body segment (which was originally at (6,5)) moves to where the head was (5,5). Then the next segment (7,5) moves to (6,5), and so on. \n\nWait, no. The entire body moves. The head moves in the chosen direction. Then each body segment moves into the position of the previous segment. So the entire body shifts forward. \n\nOriginal body: head is at (5,5), then (6,5), (7,5), etc. \n\nIf I move right, the head moves to (6,5). Then the first body segment (originally (6,5)) moves to (5,5). The next segment (7,5) moves to (6,5), and so on. \n\nSo after moving right, the head is (6,5), and the body is [ (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) ].\n\nWait, but the body segments after the head are the previous positions. So the new body after moving right would be:\n\nHead: (6,5)\n\nBody: [ (5,5), (6,5) (original first body), (7,5) (original second body), (7,4), ... ]\n\nWait, no. The body is a list of coordinates. When the snake moves, each part of the body moves into the position of the previous part. So the head moves to the new position, and each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous one. \n\nSo for a right move:\n\nHead moves from (5,5) to (6,5). \n\nThen the first body segment (which was at (6,5)) moves to (5,5). \n\nThe second body segment (7,5) moves to (6,5). \n\nThird (7,4) moves to (7,5). \n\nFourth (7,3) to (7,4). \n\nFifth (7,2) to (7,3). \n\nSixth (6,2) to (7,2). \n\nSo the new body is:\n\nHead: (6,5)\n\nBody: [ (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) ]\n\nWait, but the original body was [(6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2)]. So after moving right, the body becomes:\n\nThe first segment (6,5) moves to where the head was (5,5). \n\nThe second segment (7,5) moves to (6,5). \n\nThird (7,4) to (7,5). \n\nFourth (7,3) to (7,4). \n\nFifth (7,2) to (7,3). \n\nSixth (6,2) to (7,2). \n\nSo the new body list would be:\n\n[ (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) ]\n\nSo the head is (6,5). Now, in this new position, is (6,5) part of any snake's body? The enemy snake's body is at (0,2), (0,1), etc. So (6,5) is not in their body. My own body after moving right would have (5,5) as the first body segment. So the head (6,5) is safe. \n\nWait, but when moving right, the head is moving into (6,5), which was the previous first body segment. But after the move, that segment is now at (5,5). So the head is moving into a position that was part of the body before the move. However, according to the collision rules, if the head moves into any body part (including your own) during the movement, you die. \n\nBut during the movement, the head is moving into (6,5), which was part of the body before the move. However, during the same turn, the body segments also move. So the collision check is done after all movements. \n\nWait, the rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So when you move, after all movements, check if the new head position is in any snake's body (including your own). \n\nSo in the case of moving right, the new head is (6,5). The body after movement includes (5,5), (6,5), etc. So the head is at (6,5), which is now part of the body (the second segment). Therefore, the head is in the body, which is a collision. So moving right would result in death. \n\nAh, that's a key point. So moving right is invalid because the head would be in the body. \n\nSo direction RIGHT is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves are LEFT, UP, DOWN. \n\nNow, check each for safety. \n\nLEFT: (4,5). Is this cell safe? \n\nCheck if (4,5) is in any snake's body. My own body after moving left would be:\n\nHead at (4,5), body is [ (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) ].\n\nEnemy's body is at (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). So (4,5) is not in their body. Also, enemy head is at (0,2) if they move somewhere. But since they can choose any direction, but in the next turn, their movement is simultaneous. So if I move left to (4,5), I need to check if any enemy's head moves into (4,5) or if their body is there. \n\nBut since I don't know their next move, I can't be certain. However, the enemy's head is at (0,2). Unless they decide to move right multiple times, they can't reach (4,5) in one turn. So (4,5) is safe for now. \n\nSo LEFT is a possible move. \n\nUP: (5,6). Check if (5,6) is safe. \n\nLooking at the board, row 6 (y=6) is \"A . . . . . . T . .\", so (5,6) is empty. My body after moving up would be:\n\nHead at (5,6), body is [ (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) ].\n\nSo (5,6) is not in any body. Also, enemy's head is at (0,2). If they move up, maybe towards (0,3) (apple there). But (5,6) is far away. So UP seems safe. \n\nDOWN: (5,4). Check if (5,4) is safe. \n\nRow 4 is \". . . . . . . T . .\", so (5,4) is empty. My body after moving down would be (5,4), with body [ (5,5), ... ].\n\nEnemy's body is lower down. So (5,4) is safe. \n\nSo all three directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) are possible. \n\nNow, need to choose between them. \n\nThe strategy is to maximize apples and keep options open. \n\nLooking at apples nearby. The apples are at (0,3), (9,8), (3,5), (0,6), (1,7). \n\nMy head is at (5,5). The closest apple is (3,5) at x=3, y=5. That's two cells to the left. So moving LEFT would take me towards (3,5). \n\nIf I move LEFT, next position is (4,5). From there, the next step could be LEFT again to (3,5) where there's an apple. So that's a good path. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP or DOWN might not lead directly towards any apples. \n\nThe apple at (3,5) is two steps left from current head. So moving LEFT now would get me closer. \n\nBut after moving LEFT to (4,5), the next move could be LEFT again to (3,5) to collect the apple. \n\nBut need to make sure that after moving LEFT, the next move is possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP or DOWN, I might be going in a direction that doesn't lead to apples. \n\nThe apple at (0,3) is far away. (9,8) is also far. (0,6) and (1,7) are also not close. \n\nSo the most promising apple is (3,5). \n\nSo moving LEFT now would get me closer to that apple. \n\nBut need to check if moving LEFT is the best option. \n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT, the next body segment is (5,5), then (6,5), etc. So the path towards (3,5) is clear. \n\nBut what about future moves? If I keep moving left, I can reach (3,5) in two steps. But need to make sure that the path is not blocked by other snakes. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (0,2), which is four steps left from (4,5). So unless they move towards me, but since they are on the left side, maybe they are not a threat. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (5,6), maybe there's an apple at (0,6) or (1,7), but those are in different directions. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,4) might not lead towards any apples. \n\nSo the priority is to collect the apple at (3,5). \n\nBut moving LEFT now would take me to (4,5). Then next move could be LEFT again to (3,5). \n\nBut after that, the apple is collected, and the body would extend. \n\nBut need to make sure that moving LEFT now is safe. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy's position. If they are moving in a way that could collide with me. \n\nBut since I can't predict their exact move, I have to assume that they might move in a direction that could hit me. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving LEFT is the safest and most beneficial. \n\nSo the safest move is LEFT. \n\nBut wait, the last move was LEFT. Does moving LEFT again count as moving into the previous position? The rule says moving directly backwards into your own body. But in this case, the last move was LEFT, so moving LEFT again is continuing in the same direction. That's allowed. \n\nSo moving LEFT again is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to approach the apple at (3,5).\nLEFT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake in this situation. Let's start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake's head is at (3,6). The body follows as (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5). So the tail is at (7,5). My goal is to move without dying and collect as many apples as possible. Also, need to avoid collisions with other snakes, especially snake #0, which has a head at (0,7) and a body extending down and right. It has 8 apples, so it's close to the maximum of 30.\n\nFirst, check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each direction.\n\nMoving UP: New head would be (3,7). Is that safe? Let's see. The board state shows that in row 7, column 0 is 'T' (maybe a wall or another snake?), but looking at the board:\n\nRow 7 is the line starting with 7 0 A ... So row 7, column 0 is '0' (snake #0's head?), but wait, no. Wait, the board is printed with the highest y first? Wait, the coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. So when they list the board lines, the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. Let me parse that.\n\nThe board state is:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . A\n7 0 A . . . . . . . .\n6 T . T 1 . . . . A .\n5 T . T T T T T T . .\n4 T . . . . . . . . .\n3 T . . . . . . . . .\n2 T . . . . . . . . .\n1 T T . . . A . . . .\n0 A T . . . . . . . .\n\nSo each line is a row from y=9 (top) to y=0 (bottom). So row 7 would be the line starting with 7 0 A... which is y=7. So the coordinates (x,y) where x is the column (0-9) and y is the row (0-9), with y=9 being the top.\n\nSo my snake's head is at (3,6), which is in row 6 (since the line starting with 6 is T . T 1...). So moving up would take me to (3,7). Let's check if that's safe.\n\nLooking at row 7 (y=7), the line is:\n\n7 0 A . . . . . . . .\n\nBreaking that down, the cells are:\n\nx=0: '0' (maybe snake #0's head?), but snake #0's head is at (0,7) according to the info. Yes. So (0,7) is snake #0's head. Then (1,7) is 'A' (apple at 1,7). So my move to (3,7) would be in row 7, x=3. That cell is '.' so empty. So moving up is possible? But need to check if any snake's body is there. Snake #0's body is [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)] and head at (0,7). So their body doesn't reach x=3, y=7. So (3,7) is empty. So moving up is a possible option.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (3,7), what about next moves? Also, need to check if other snakes might move there. But since all moves are simultaneous, other snakes' moves could affect this. But for the current step, the check is whether any part of any other snake's body is at (3,7) after their move? Or is the check for my move whether any other snake's body (after their move) is in that cell? Hmm, the rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So during the same turn, when all snakes move, each snake's head moves, and if any part of any snake's body (after their movement) is in the new head's position, then the head dies. Wait, no. Wait, the exact rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So when the heads move, they check if the new position is in any snake's body (including their own) after the movement. So for my move, I need to check if the new position (3,7) is in any snake's body (after their movement) or head. But since all snakes move simultaneously, their bodies will have moved. So for example, snake #0's head is moving somewhere else. But in this case, snake #0's current head is at (0,7). If they move, say, down or right, their body would adjust. But I can't know their next move. So perhaps the safest approach is to assume that their bodies might be in certain positions. But maybe the problem is that during the same turn, when all snakes move, their heads and bodies move. So when I check if moving to (3,7) would collide with any snake's body (after they move), but since I can't predict their moves, perhaps the enemy snakes' bodies are in positions that could be there. But this is complicated. However, according to the rules, the collision is checked after all moves. So during the current turn, when choosing my move, I need to check if my new head position is in any snake's body (after their movement) or head. But since I don't know the enemy's moves, this is tricky. However, maybe the enemy's current body positions are known. For example, snake #0's current body is [(0,6), (0,5), ..., (1,0)]. If they move in some direction, their body parts would shift. For example, if snake #0 moves right, their new head would be (1,7), and the body would be [ (0,7), (0,6), ... ].\n\nBut perhaps the safest way is to check the current positions. Wait, no. Because the collision is checked after all snakes have moved. So for example, if I move to (3,7), and snake #0's head moves to (1,7), then their body would be [ (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), ... ][. So the cell (3,7) is not part of their body. So maybe moving up to (3,7) is safe. But I need to check if any other snake's body could be in (3,7) after their move. Since I can't know their moves, perhaps the best approach is to check if any of the enemy snakes' current body positions could result in (3,7) being part of their body after their movement. Alternatively, perhaps the safest way is to check if the new position is occupied by any snake's head or body in the current state, but that's not correct because they might move. However, the rules state that during the turn, all snakes move simultaneously. So when checking for collision, it's the new positions after all moves. Therefore, if I move to (3,7), I need to check if any other snake's new head or body is in that cell. But since I don't know their moves, this is impossible to predict. However, the problem says that in the decision process, you must eliminate moves that would immediately kill you. So \"immediately\" here refers to the current positions. Wait, no. The rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So the check is after all snakes have moved. Therefore, even if during this turn, another snake moves into a position that collides with my new head, that would kill me. But since I can't predict their moves, how can I account for that? The problem says that during the decision process, you must eliminate any move that would \"immediately\" kill you. So perhaps \"immediately\" here means based on the current state, not considering the enemy's possible moves. Or maybe the enemy's current body positions. This is a bit ambiguous. But according to the rules, the collision is checked after all snakes have moved. Therefore, the only way a move is invalid (kills you) is if your new head position is in any snake's body (after their movement) or head. But since I can't know their moves, perhaps the only way to check is to look at their current positions and see if moving to a certain cell would definitely result in collision. For example, if another snake is already in that cell, then even if they move, their body would shift, but maybe their head could move into that cell. This is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"immediately kill\" refers to the current state. For example, if moving into a cell that is currently occupied by another snake's body, then even if they move, but in this case, since all snakes move, their bodies would shift. So maybe the current state's body positions are not the ones that matter. This is confusing. But according to the problem's decision process step 2: \"Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\" So the key is that the move would result in the new head position being in any snake's body (including your own) after the movement. But since the movement of other snakes is not known, perhaps the \"immediately kill\" refers to the current positions. Wait, that can't be right. Because if another snake is moving into your new head position, that would kill you. But since you can't predict their moves, perhaps the only way to check is if in the current state, the new head position is occupied by any snake's head or body. Because if it's not occupied now, but could be occupied after their move, that's a risk. But the problem's step 2 says to eliminate moves that would immediately kill you. So perhaps \"immediately\" here refers to the current state. For example, if the new position is currently occupied by another snake's body or head, then that move is invalid. But that's not correct according to the rules. Because even if the new position is empty now, but after other snakes move, they could move into that position. However, the problem's step 2 says to eliminate moves that would immediately kill you. So maybe \"immediately\" here refers to the current state. For example, if the new position is currently occupied by any snake's body or head, then that move is invalid. But that's not how the rules work. The rules state that during the turn, all snakes move, and then collisions are checked. So the only way a move is invalid is if after all snakes have moved, the new head is in any snake's body (including your own) or head. But since I can't know where the other snakes will move, I can't be sure. However, the problem's step 2 says to eliminate moves that would immediately kill you. So perhaps the \"immediately\" here is based on the current state, not considering the enemies' moves. That would make sense for the problem's context. Otherwise, it's impossible to make a safe move because you can't predict the enemies' actions. Therefore, perhaps step 2 refers to checking if the new position is in the current positions of any snake's body or head. So for example, if moving to (3,7) is in the current positions of any snake's body or head, then that move is invalid. Let's check that.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nMy snake's head is (3,6). Body is [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5)].\n\nSnake #0's head is (0,7). Body is [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)].\n\nOther snakes? The problem mentions \"Enemy snakes: Snake #0\". So maybe there are others, but they are not listed. Wait, the problem says \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - ...\". So perhaps there are other enemy snakes not listed. But the board state shows some 'T's. The 'T's might represent other snakes. Let me check the board state.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 5: T . T T T T T T . . \n\nSo in row 5 (y=5), there are Ts. So maybe 'T' represents other snakes. So perhaps there are other snakes on the board. But their positions are not given. So the problem's input only gives info about snake #0 and me (snake 1). The rest of the snakes are represented by 'T's on the board. But their exact positions are not known. This complicates things. Because when considering collision, we have to consider all other snakes, not just snake #0. But since their positions are not given, how can we check for collisions? This seems like a problem. But perhaps the 'T's on the board are part of other snakes' bodies. For example, in row 5, there are multiple Ts. So those are part of other snakes' bodies. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to check for collisions. Therefore, perhaps the only snakes we need to consider for collision are snake #0 and ourselves. Because the others are not provided in the input. Wait, but the problem says \"all snakes\" in the rules. So perhaps the 'T's are other snakes, and their positions are part of the board. But since the input doesn't specify their exact coordinates, maybe we can't account for them. This is a problem. However, given the information provided, perhaps the only snakes we need to consider are snake #0 and ourselves. Because the other snakes' positions are not given. But that might not be correct. However, given the data, we have to work with what's provided.\n\nSo, back to the possible moves. Let's check each direction.\n\nFirst, moving UP to (3,7). Check if that cell is currently occupied by any snake's body or head. Snake #0's head is at (0,7), body includes (0,6), (0,5), etc. So (3,7) is empty. My own body is at (3,5) (since head is (3,6), body is (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc. So (3,5) is part of my body. So moving up to (3,7) is not in my current body. So it's a possible move. But after moving, will any snake's head or body be in (3,7)? For example, snake #0's head is at (0,7). If they move, say, right to (1,7), then their body would be [ (1,7), (0,7), ... ][. So (3,7) is still empty. So moving up seems safe. But if another snake is moving into (3,7), that would kill me. But since we don't know their moves, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that other snakes might not move into that cell. Alternatively, perhaps the 'T's on the board indicate that there are other snakes present. For example, in row 5, which is y=5, there are Ts. So maybe those are parts of other snakes. If I move to (3,7), which is in row 7, perhaps other snakes are not there. So maybe moving up is a safe option.\n\nSecond, moving DOWN to (3,5). But (3,5) is part of my own body. Because my body includes (3,5). So moving down would make the new head at (3,5), which is currently part of my body. But according to the rules, moving into your own body (including backwards) is a death. So moving down would result in the head moving into (3,5), which is part of the current body. Therefore, this move is invalid and would kill me. So DOWN is eliminated.\n\nThird, LEFT to (2,6). Check if that's safe. The current position (2,6) is part of my body (since the body is [(2,6), ... ]). So moving left would take the head to (2,6), which is part of the current body. Therefore, this is a collision with myself. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nFourth, RIGHT to (4,6). Check if that's safe. The current position (4,6) is not part of my body. My body is at (3,6) head, then (2,6), (2,5), etc. So (4,6) is empty. Also, check if any other snake's body is there. Snake #0's positions are at (0,7) and their body. So (4,6) is not in their current positions. So moving right seems safe. So possible options are UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, between UP and RIGHT. Which is better?\n\nLet's think about the apples. The apples are at (9,8), (1,7), (5,1), (0,0), (8,6). My current position is (3,6). So moving right to (4,6) is closer to some apples. For example, (5,5) is part of my body, but (5,1) is an apple. Alternatively, (1,7) is an apple. So moving up to (3,7) would be closer to (1,7) (since (3,7) is x=3, y=7, and (1,7) is x=1, y=7. So moving left from (3,7) would get to (1,7) in two steps. But if I move right to (4,6), perhaps I can head towards (5,1) or (8,6). (8,6) is an apple. (8,6) is at x=8, y=6. So from (4,6), moving right would take me towards that. But need to see the path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,7) might allow me to approach (1,7) apple. But snake #0's head is at (0,7). If snake #0 moves, say, right to (1,7), which is an apple, then they would collect that apple. So if I move up to (3,7), then next turn, if snake #0 moves to (1,7), they would get the apple. But if I move right, I might be moving towards other apples. Also, considering that snake #0 has 8 apples, and I have 7. If they collect another apple, they could reach 9, but that's not immediately dangerous. However, if I can collect apples while avoiding their path, that's better.\n\nAnother factor: my current body is a straight line from (3,6) down to (7,5). So if I move right to (4,6), the next move could be right again towards (5,6), but need to check if that's safe. Alternatively, moving up might allow me to turn in a different direction.\n\nAlso, need to consider the future options. Moving right would take me along the x-axis, which might be a longer path but could lead to apples. Moving up might allow me to go towards (1,7) apple, but need to avoid snake #0's possible moves.\n\nAnother thing: the last move was RIGHT. So my previous move was right. The problem says that moving directly backward into your own body is a death. But since the last move was right, moving left would be the opposite direction. However, in this case, the previous move was right, so moving left now would be the opposite. But in this case, the possible moves are up and right. So no backward movement here.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT. Let's analyze each.\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (3,7).\n\n- Immediate safety: (3,7) is empty in current positions. So safe.\n\n- Next steps: If I move up, then next turn, I can move in any direction. The apple at (1,7) is two steps left and up. But if I move up now, then next turn, I could move left to (2,7), then left again to (1,7). However, snake #0's head is at (0,7). If they move right to (1,7), they would collect that apple. So if I move up now, then next turn, snake #0 might take the apple, but I could still get it if they don't. But there's a risk of collision. For example, if snake #0 moves to (1,7), then my head would be at (3,7) next turn. No collision. But if I move up now, then next turn, I can approach (1,7) if possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (4,6) might allow me to approach (8,6) apple. From (4,6) to (8,6) is four steps right. But need to make sure that path is clear. The snake's body after moving right would be: new head (4,6), then previous head (3,6), then (2,6), etc. So the body would be along x=3,4,5,6,7. So moving right would create a path towards (8,6). However, there's a 'T' in row 5, column 4 (y=5, x=4). Wait, in the board state, row 5 (y=5) has T at x=0, then . at x=1, T at x=2, T at x=3, T at x=4, etc. Wait, the line for y=5 is \"5 T . T T T T T T . .\". So x=0 is T, x=1 is ., x=2 is T, x=3 is T, x=4 is T, x=5 is T, x=6 is T, x=7 is T, x=8 is ., x=9 is . So (4,5) is T. So if I move right to (4,6), then next move right would be (5,6). But (5,5) is part of my current body. So moving to (5,6) would be adjacent to (5,5), which is part of my body. But since the body moves, after moving right, the body would be (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5). Wait, no. The body after moving right would be the previous head (3,6) becomes the next body segment. So after moving right to (4,6), the new body segments would be:\n\nHead: (4,6)\n\nBody: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) ]\n\nSo the next move right would take me to (5,6). Then the body would be [4,6], [3,6], etc. So (5,6) is not part of the current body. So moving right again would be possible. However, in row 5, there are multiple Ts. For example, (4,5) is T. If that's part of another snake's body, then moving into (4,6) is safe, but moving down to (4,5) would be dangerous if that T is a snake's body. But since we don't know, perhaps it's safer to avoid those areas.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (8,6) could be a good path. The apple at (8,6) is in row 6, x=8. From (4,6), moving right four times would reach there. But need to check if that path is safe. However, if there are other snakes in that path, it could be dangerous. But given the information, perhaps that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,7) could allow me to collect the apple at (1,7). But (1,7) is an apple. If I can reach that, it's a good opportunity. However, snake #0 is at (0,7). If they move right to (1,7), they would take that apple. So if I move up to (3,7), then next turn, if snake #0 moves to (1,7), I could still move towards (1,7) if possible. But if they do, then I can't. So there's a risk. However, if I move right, I can avoid that area and go towards other apples.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake #0 has 8 apples. If they collect another, they might be closer to 30. But with 8, they need 22 more. Not sure if that's a big threat. But they are in a position to collect apples. So perhaps I should focus on collecting apples that are safer.\n\nLooking at the apples: (9,8) is in the top right. (1,7) is near snake #0. (5,1) is in the middle. (0,0) is bottom left. (8,6) is near my current position.\n\nIf I move right to (4,6), I can start moving towards (8,6). Let's see the path. From (4,6), next right would be (5,6). Then (6,6), (7,6), (8,6). That's four moves. But need to make sure that each step is safe. For example, (5,6) is currently empty. But if there's another snake in that path, it could be a problem. However, given the information, perhaps that's a viable path.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (3,7) could allow me to go left towards (1,7) apple. But that's two steps left. However, snake #0's head is at (0,7). If they move right to (1,7), they would take that apple. So if I move up now, then next turn, if snake #0 moves to (1,7), I can't take it. But if I move right, I can avoid that area.\n\nAnother factor: the snake #0's body is along x=0, y from 7 down to 0. So their path is vertical on the left side. If I move right, I'm moving away from them. If I move up, I'm moving into a different area. So maybe moving right is safer in terms of avoiding snake #0.\n\nAlso, my current position is (3,6). Moving right would take me towards (8,6), which is an apple. That seems like a good target. The distance is 4 steps. If I can get there without collision, that's +1 apple. Alternatively, moving up to (3,7) and then left to (1,7) would be two steps. But snake #0's head is at (0,7). If they move right to (1,7), they take the apple. So if I move up, then next turn, if they move right, I can't get that apple. But if I move right now, I can avoid that area and go for (8,6).\n\nAnother thing: the game allows me to grow by eating apples. So getting (8,6) would give me 8 apples, which is one more than snake #0's 8. But if I can get that, it's a good move. However, need to check if the path is safe.\n\nBut what if there are other snakes in the path to (8,6)? For example, the Ts in row 5 (y=5) might be parts of other snakes. If moving right towards (8,6) requires passing through areas with other snakes, that could be dangerous. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to tell. However, based on the given info, perhaps moving right is safer.\n\nAlternatively, moving up could allow me to approach (1,7) if snake #0 doesn't take it. But that's a gamble.\n\nAnother point: the last move was right. So moving right again would continue in that direction. If I keep moving right, I can reach (8,6) in four moves. But each turn, I need to check if the next move is safe. For example, after moving right to (4,6), next move right to (5,6) would be safe. Then (6,6), (7,6), (8,6). But need to check if any of those positions are occupied by other snakes. For example, in row 6, the line is \"6 T . T 1 . . . . A .\". So at y=6, x=0 is T (maybe another snake's body?), x=2 is T, x=3 is T (my head's previous position?), but my current head is at (3,6). So (3,6) is my head. So (5,6) would be in row 6, x=5. The line for y=6 is \"5 T . . . . . . . .\", so x=5 is '.'. So (5,6) is empty. Then (6,6) is also '.' in that line. (7,6) is '.' as well. So moving right towards (8,6) seems possible. So that path is clear in the current state.\n\nSo moving right to (4,6) seems like a good option. Then, in subsequent turns, I can keep moving right towards (8,6). But what about other directions? For example, after moving right, maybe there are other apples along the way. But (8,6) is the closest apple in that direction.\n\nComparing the two options: UP vs RIGHT.\n\nUP: potentially leads to (1,7) apple, but risk of snake #0 taking it. Also, after moving up, the next moves could be left or down, but need to avoid snake #0's path.\n\nRIGHT: leads towards (8,6) apple, which is a direct path. Also, moving right continues away from snake #0's position, which is on the left side.\n\nSo moving right seems better because it's a direct path to an apple, and avoids the area near snake #0. Also, moving right doesn't have immediate collision risks based on current positions.\n\nAnother check: moving right to (4,6). Is that cell part of any other snake's body? According to the board state, row 6 (y=6) is \"6 T . T 1 . . . . A .\". So x=0 is T (maybe another snake's body?), x=2 is T, x=3 is T (my head's previous position?), but in the current state, my head is at (3,6), which is part of my own body. Wait, no. The body after moving right would be [ (3,6), ... ][. So in the current state, (3,6) is my head. So (4,6) is empty. So moving right is safe.\n\nTherefore, the possible moves are UP and RIGHT. Need to choose between them.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake #0's current position is (0,7). If I move up to (3,7), then in the next turn, snake #0 might move in a way that could threaten me. For example, if they move down or right. But without knowing their move, it's hard to say. However, moving right keeps me in a different area.\n\nSo, based on the decision process steps:\n\n1. Eliminate moves that kill. DOWN and LEFT are invalid. So choices are UP and RIGHT.\n\n2. Among these, favor moves that allow eating apples and keep future options open.\n\nMoving right leads towards (8,6) apple. That's a clear path. Moving up could lead to (1,7) but with risk of collision if snake #0 moves there. Also, after moving up, the next moves would need to navigate around snake #0's possible movements.\n\nSo perhaps moving right is better. Therefore, the final move should be RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

It also minimizes the chance of immediate head-on collisions with the enemy, who is currently two rows below and would need several turns to intercept on this path.\n- If the apple at (9,8) is still there when you reach it, you\u2019ll eat it and gain a quick point. If not, you still have flexible follow-ups (continue along the row or dip toward other apples like (8,6)) without trapping yourself prematurely.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT now to begin a horizontal sweep toward (9,8). Keep a lookout for the enemy\u2019s position and avoid turning back into your neck.\n- If (9,8) is gone, aim for (8,6) by a controlled downward/rightward arc, but only after ensuring you have safe exit options to avoid getting boxed in by walls or enemy segments.\n- Prioritize eating apples when safely reachable, and always avoid reversing into your own neck or into another snake\u2019s body. Maintain multiple safe continuations to stay flexible.\n\nRIGHT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let me try to figure out the best move for my snake. First, I need to understand the current situation based on the given data.\n\nMy snake's head is at (7,6). The body segments are a bit scattered: from (6,6) down to (3,6) along the same x-axis, then spiraling to (2,5) and (3,5). The apples collected so far are 7, and I need to avoid collisions with other snakes and not run into my own body.\n\nLooking at the board state, there are some obstacles marked with T's, which I assume represent other snakes or maybe bombs or something. Wait, the board shows snake #0's head at (3,8) and body parts in between. Also, there are apples at (9,8), (5,1), (0,0), (8,6), (5,9). \n\nThe apples that are worth collecting are the ones I haven't collected yet. Since I have 7 apples, and the total apples listed are 5, maybe I already collected some, but the problem is to collect more. However, the main apples listed in the current state are (9,8), (5,1), (0,0), (8,6), (5,9). Wait, the user's snake has collected 7, which is more than the 5 listed here. So maybe some of these apples have already been eaten, or perhaps the list is the remaining ones. But regardless, the goal is to collect more apples without dying.\n\nFirst, I need to check which directions are safe. The last move was RIGHT, which moved from (6,6) to (7,6)? Wait, the last move was RIGHT, so before that, the head was at (6,6), and moving right to (7,6). But that seems conflicting because the body has (6,6) as the first segment. Wait, the body list is [(6,6), (5,6), ...]. So if the head was at (6,6) and moved right to (7,6), then the previous head position was (6,6), and the next move right would take it to (7,6). But then, the body segment (6,6) is now behind the head. Wait, no. When the snake moves, the head moves forward, and the tail is shed unless it eats an apple. Since the last move was RIGHT, and the head is at (7,6), the previous position was (6,6). So moving right again would take it to (8,6). But wait, the apple at (8,6) is present. So if I move right now, I would be moving into (8,6), which is an apple. That's good because eating an apple gives me a point. But I need to check if moving right is safe.\n\nBut let me check each direction for safety.\n\nCurrent head position is (7,6). Possible moves:\n\nUP: (7,7)\nDOWN: (7,5)\nLEFT: (6,6) \u2013 but that's the previous body segment. Wait, moving left would take me to (6,6), which is the first body segment. Because in the body list, the next segment after the head is (6,6). So moving left would put the head into the next segment, which is considered a collision. Because the head can't move into its own body. So that's invalid. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nWait, the rule says if the head moves into any snake's body (including own), you die. So moving left to (6,6) would be into the first body segment. So that's a collision. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nRIGHT: (8,6). That's the apple location. But is that safe? Because the head would move to (8,6), which is an apple. But we need to check if (8,6) is occupied by any snake's body. Let's check.\n\nSnake #0's head is at (3,8), and their body is [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2)]. So (8,6) is not in snake #0's body. So moving right to (8,6) would be safe. But then, after moving, the head is at (8,6), which is an apple. So that's a good move because we can collect it. But wait, the last move was RIGHT, which moved from (6,6) to (7,6). So the next move right would be (8,6). So that's possible.\n\nBut I need to check if (8,6) is safe. Let's confirm.\n\nMy own body after moving right would have the head at (8,6), and the body would be [ (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), ... ] etc. So as long as (8,6) isn't part of any snake's body, it's safe.\n\nSnake #0's body includes (0,6), (0,5), etc. So (8,6) is not part of their body. So moving right is safe. Also, (8,6) is an apple, so moving there would let me collect it, increasing my apples to 8. That's a good move.\n\nBut wait, what about other directions? Let's check UP, DOWN, etc.\n\nUP: (7,7). Is that a safe cell? Check if it's off the board? No, since y=7 is within 0-9. Check if it's in any snake's body. For snake #0, their body is at (3,8), (2,8), etc., and their body includes (0,4), (0,3), etc. So (7,7) is not in snake #0's body. Also, not in my own body. My body after moving up would have segments (6,6), (5,6), etc. So (7,7) is clear. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN: (7,5). Check if that's safe. (7,5) is not in snake #0's body. Also, not in my own body. So down is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, among these three, which is better?\n\nThe objective is to collect apples and survive. Let's look at the apples. The apples at (8,6) is directly in front if I move right. So moving right would collect that apple, giving me 8 apples. That's good. But I need to ensure that after that, I can still move safely in future turns.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) might take me towards other apples. Let's see. The apples at (5,9) is up left from (7,6). Moving up could be a path towards that. Similarly, (5,1) is down left, but maybe not accessible. The (0,0) apple is way down left, but that's far.\n\nSo moving right to (8,6) gives an immediate apple. But I need to check if that move leaves me in a position where future moves are possible. For example, after moving right to (8,6), what directions can I take next?\n\nIf next move is right again, to (9,6). But there's an apple at (9,8). Maybe not directly. Alternatively, up from (8,6) to (8,7), etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) now. Then, from there, maybe towards (5,9) which is an apple. Let's see: from (7,7), moving left two steps would get to (5,7), but the apple is at (5,9). So maybe moving up again towards that.\n\nBut the key is that moving right gives an apple now, which is good. But maybe moving up allows more apples in the future. However, the immediate apple is better because collecting it now increases the score and might help in case of a tie at the end.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake #0. Their head is at (3,8), and their body is along x=0, y from 2 to 8. So they are moving in some direction. Their last move isn't clear, but their head is at (3,8). If they are moving, say, left, or down, but their body is in the left side. So moving right would take me away from them, which is good. Because if I move right, I'm on x=8, while snake #0 is on x=0-3. So collision with them is unlikely.\n\nBut during this turn, when all snakes move, snake #0's head is at (3,8). What direction will they move? We don't know, but their movement could affect our safety. For example, if they move into our path.\n\nBut since we have to choose a direction now, considering possible future moves. The problem is that if we move right to (8,6), then in the next turn, if snake #0 moves in a certain direction, could they collide with us? Unlikely, since they are on the left side. But maybe not. So moving right seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: moving right might lead to a position where future moves are blocked. For example, if after eating (8,6), the next move could be blocked if the body is in the way. Let's see. After moving right to (8,6), the body would be [ (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) ]. So the next move from (8,6) could be right to (9,6), which is possible. Or up to (8,7), etc. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, if we move up to (7,7), then from there, perhaps towards (5,9). But (5,9) is two apples away. Let's see the path. From (7,7), moving left to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8), then up to (5,9). But each move needs to avoid collisions. But that's two moves away. However, maybe there are obstacles in the way. Looking at the board state, row 6 (y=6) has a lot of T's. Wait, the board state shows:\n\nRow 6 (y=6) is: T . T T T T T 1 A . \n\nSo x from 0 to 9. The T's might be other snakes. For example, snake #0's body is at (0,6), but other Ts might be other parts. So if I move up to (7,7), then next moves could be affected by the Ts. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving right to (8,6) is an apple, and then from there, maybe up or down.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the enemy snake #0 has 9 apples, which is more than me. So if we both survive, they might win. So I need to collect as many apples as possible quickly.\n\nSo moving right to get the apple at (8,6) would give me 8 apples. That's a significant step towards 30. But maybe there are more apples in other directions. Let's check other apples. The apple at (5,9) is in the top left. If I can reach that, it's another apple. Similarly, (9,8) is near.\n\nBut the immediate apple is (8,6). So maybe taking that is the best option. But I need to make sure that after moving right, I have safe paths.\n\nAnother thing: the rules state that if two snakes' heads collide, both die. So if I move right to (8,6), and snake #0 moves into that cell, we both die. But snake #0's current position is (3,8). If they move in a direction that takes them to (8,6), that's unlikely. But we can't predict their move. However, since they are on x=3, moving to x=8 would require moving right 5 steps, which is possible over multiple turns. But during this turn, they can only move one step. So if snake #0 moves right from (3,8) to (4,8), that's possible. But (4,8) is not (8,6), so no collision. So moving right is safe in terms of collision with snake #0 this turn.\n\nBut I should also check if any other snake's head could move into (8,6). The other snakes (if any) aren't mentioned, but since only snake #0 is listed as enemy, maybe there are others. But according to the data, only snake #0 is present. So (8,6) is safe.\n\nSo moving right is a valid and safe move. It collects an apple, which is good. The next step is to see if this move leaves me with good options.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) might allow me to go towards (5,9). Let's see. From (7,7), the next move could be left to (6,7), then left to (5,7), then up to (5,8), then up to (5,9). But each of those steps needs to be safe. However, the path might be clear. But the apple at (5,9) is two moves up from (7,7). But maybe that's a longer path. But since moving right gives an immediate apple, that's better.\n\nAnother thing: the last move was right. If I move right again, that's two consecutive rights. But that's allowed as long as it's safe. The problem is that after moving right to (8,6), the next move right would be to (9,6), which is possible. But (9,6) is not an apple. The apple at (9,8) is two steps up. So maybe after collecting (8,6), moving up twice could get to (9,8). But that's two moves. However, in the next turn, after eating (8,6), the head is at (8,6), and the next move could be up to (8,7), but there's a T at (9,7) in the board? Wait, the board's row 8 (y=8) is:\n\n8 . T T 0 . . . . . A\n\nSo at x=2 and 3, there are Ts. So (8,8) is an apple. But if I move up from (8,6) to (8,7), then next up to (8,8) which is an apple. But I need to check if those cells are safe.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move is to get (8,6). So moving right seems good.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake #0's head is at (3,8). If they move down to (3,7), then maybe they could affect my path. But I'm at (7,6), so not directly. But maybe in future turns.\n\nBut the key is to collect apples now. So moving right to (8,6) is the best option. It's safe, collects an apple, and positions me to possibly collect more apples in the future.\n\nBut wait, let me check if (8,6) is indeed safe. The snake #0's body includes (0,6), which is in row 6, x=0. So (8,6) is in the same row but x=8. So no collision. Also, my own body after moving right would be (8,6) as head, followed by (7,6), which was the previous head. So no collision with my own body.\n\nSo yes, moving right is safe. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

Now possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT, but LEFT is invalid because it would go to (6,6), which is part of my own body. \n\nSo possible directions are UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5), and RIGHT (8,6). Let's check each for safety.\n\nFirst, check if any of these positions are off the board. All are within 0-9 for both x and y. So that's fine.\n\nNext, check if any of these positions are occupied by another snake's body. Snake #0's head is at (4,8), and their body includes (0,6), (0,5), etc. So (7,7), (7,5), (8,6) aren't in snake #0's body. Also, the other positions in their body don't overlap here. So all three moves are safe in terms of avoiding other snakes.\n\nNow, check if any of these are in my own body. My body is [(7,6), (6,6), ...], so (7,6) is the head's current position. Moving UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), or RIGHT to (8,6) are all new positions not in my body. So all three are safe.\n\nNow, the next step is to see which move is best. The apple at (8,6) is directly to the right. Collecting that would give me an apple, which is good. If I move right to (8,6), I can collect that apple. That's an immediate gain. \n\nAlternatively, moving up or down might lead to other apples. Let's check the apple positions. The remaining apples for me are (9,8), (5,1), (0,0), (5,9), (9,2). Wait, I have 8 apples now, so maybe some of these have already been collected. But according to the data, the apples at (8,6) is one of them. So moving right to (8,6) would collect that apple, giving me 8 apples. That's a good immediate gain.\n\nIf I move right, next turn I can consider moving further. But I need to make sure that after moving right, I have safe options. Let's see. After moving right to (8,6), the next possible moves would be UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), RIGHT (9,6). But (9,6) is not an apple. The apple at (9,8) is two steps up from (8,6). But maybe that's a path. However, moving right now is safe and gives an immediate apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (7,7) might open up a path towards (5,9) which is another apple. But that's two steps away. Similarly, moving down might not be as beneficial.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy snake is on the left side (x=0-3), moving right takes me further away, which is good to avoid collisions with them. \n\nSo moving right seems like the best immediate choice because it collects an apple and is safe. Also, after moving right, the next move could be up or down towards other apples. \n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake's head is at (3,8). If they move in a direction that brings them closer to my path, but since they are on the left, and I'm moving right, that's unlikely to cause a collision in the next turn. \n\nSo the safest and most beneficial move is RIGHT to (8,6) to collect the apple there.\nRIGHT",

Wait, in the last move, the previous position was (6,6) moving right to (7,6)? Wait, no. Wait, the last move was RIGHT. So the previous head position was (6,6), and then moved right to (7,6). But according to the current head position given in the snake info, the head is at (9,6). Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check.\n\nWait, the snake's body is listed as [(8,6), (7,6), (6,6), ...], so the head is at (9,6), followed by (8,6), etc. So the last move was from (8,6) to (9,6), which is a RIGHT move. Because the body is ordered head to tail. So the last move was RIGHT from (8,6) to (9,6). So the current head is (9,6), previous was (8,6). \n\nSo possible moves now are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Let me confirm. The last move was RIGHT, so moving LEFT would take it back to (8,6), which is part of the body. So LEFT is invalid. So possible directions are UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5), and RIGHT (10,6). Wait, but the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0 to 9. So moving RIGHT from (9,6) would take x to 10, which is off the board. That's a death. So RIGHT is invalid. Oh, wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Because in the last move, the move was RIGHT from (8,6) to (9,6). Now, the current head is at (9,6). So moving RIGHT again would go to (10,6), which is outside the board. So that's invalid. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, and LEFT? Wait, no. Because the last move was RIGHT, but moving LEFT now would go to (8,6), which is part of the body. The body is [(8,6), (7,6), ...], so (8,6) is the first body segment. So moving LEFT would take the head to (8,6), which is part of the body. Therefore, that's invalid. So only UP and DOWN are possible. \n\nWait, this is a critical point. The last move was RIGHT, so the next possible moves can't be back into the previous position (which is (8,6)), so LEFT is invalid. Also, moving RIGHT would take it to (10,6), which is off the board. So the only possible directions are UP and DOWN. \n\nWait, that changes everything. So in the previous analysis, I thought RIGHT was possible, but actually, moving RIGHT from (9,6) would go to (10,6), which is invalid. So the possible moves are only UP and DOWN. \n\nSo the initial analysis was wrong. So the correct possible moves are UP (9,7) and DOWN (9,5). \n\nNow, check if those positions are safe. Let's look at the board state. \n\nThe board is shown as:\n\n9 . . . . . A . . . .\n8 . T T T T 0 . . . A\n7 T T . . . . . . . .\n6 T . T T T T T T T 1\n5 T . T . . . . . . .\n4 T . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . A\n1 . . . . . A . . . .\n0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo row 9 (top row) is x=9. The head is at (9,6). The possible moves are up to (9,7) and down to (9,5). \n\nFirst, check if (9,7) is on the board. Yes, since y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (9,7) is valid. Similarly, (9,5) is valid. \n\nNow, check if any other snakes are in those positions. \n\nSnake #0's head is at (5,8). Their body is [(4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4)]. So (9,7) and (9,5) are not part of snake 0's body. \n\nOther apples: (9,8) is an apple. So if I move up to (9,7), next turn I could move up again to (9,8) to get that apple. Alternatively, moving down to (9,5) might not be near any apples. Let's check the remaining apples. The apples for me are (9,8), (5,1), (0,0), (5,9), (9,2). Since I have 8 apples, maybe some have been collected. The apple at (9,8) is still there. \n\nSo moving up to (9,7) would bring me closer to (9,8). That's a good move. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,5) might not be as beneficial. \n\nSo between UP and DOWN. \n\nCheck if the next move options are safe. For example, if I move up to (9,7), next turn possible moves would be UP (9,8) which is an apple, or DOWN (9,6) which is the previous position (but since the body moves, after moving up, the new body would be [ (9,7), (9,6), ... ] so moving down would be (9,6), which is part of the body. So that's invalid. Wait, no. When moving, the entire snake moves. So when you move, each segment follows the previous one. So after moving up to (9,7), the new body would be [ (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), ... ]. So in the next turn, possible moves from (9,7) are up to (9,8), down to (9,6) (which is now part of the body), left to (8,7), right is invalid. \n\nSo if I move up now, next turn I can collect the apple at (9,8) by moving up again. That's a good plan. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,5) might not lead to an apple immediately. The apples at (9,2) is two steps down. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy snake's position. They are on the left side. So moving up or down on the right side (x=9) is probably safe. \n\nSo the best move here is to go UP to (9,7) to collect the apple at (9,8) next turn. \n\nBut wait, moving UP now would take me to (9,7). Then next turn, moving up again to (9,8) would collect the apple. So that's two moves to get that apple. Alternatively, is there a way to get there faster? No, since (9,8) is adjacent. \n\nBut in this turn, moving up to (9,7) is safe. Let's confirm that (9,7) is not occupied by any other snake. Snake 0's body doesn't include that position. \n\nSo the best move is UP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (9,5) could be better if there's a path to another apple. But the apples at (9,2) are two steps down. But maybe that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up is better because the apple is just one step away. \n\nSo the conclusion is to move UP.\nUP",

The last move was RIGHT, so moving left back to (8,6) is invalid because it's part of the body. Also, moving right would go to (10,6), which is off the board. So only UP and DOWN are possible.\n\nLooking at the board, moving up would take the head to (9,7). The apple at (9,8) is adjacent, so next turn moving up again could collect it. That's two moves to get that apple. But wait, if I move up now, then next turn moving up again would be (9,8), which is an apple. That would be good. Alternatively, moving down to (9,5) might not be as beneficial immediately.\n\nThe enemy snake is on the left side, so moving up or down on the right edge is safe. The apple at (9,8) is a priority since it's close. Also, moving up could keep the path open for future moves towards other apples like (5,9) or (9,2), but those are farther away. \n\nAnother consideration is future moves. If I move up now, the next move can be up to get the apple. If I move down, then I might need to navigate around to reach apples. Also, keeping the option to move up next turn is better because it gives a clear path to an apple. \n\nSo the best move is UP to (9,7), setting up for next turn to collect the apple at (9,8).\nUP",

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the game. My snake is at (7,7) with a body that stretches down to (4,6) and right to (9,7), etc. The apples are at (5,1), (0,0), (9,2), (0,4), (2,3). The enemy snake is at (9,9) with a long body extending left and down. \n\nMy last move was LEFT, which moved me from (7,7) to (6,7) perhaps? Wait, coordinates: decreasing x is left. So moving LEFT from (7,7) would go to (6,7). But looking at the board state, in row 7 (the 7th row from the bottom?), my head is at (7,7). Wait, the board is 10x10, with (0,0) at bottom left. So rows go from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So y increases upwards. So (7,7) is in row 7 (second from top?), and x is 7. \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (9,9), which is top right. Their body is going left and down. So they might be moving towards me? Or maybe away. Let me check their body positions. The enemy's body includes (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), etc. So they are moving left and down. Their current direction might be LEFT and then DOWN? \n\nMy goal is to collect apples and avoid collisions. Let's look at the apples. The closest apples to my current position (7,7) would be (9,2) which is two steps right and five down? Wait, (9,2) is x=9, y=2. My current head is at (7,7). So moving right to x=9 would take two steps. But there's an apple at (9,2). But maybe there's a closer one. Let's check all apples:\n\n- (5,1): x=5, y=1. That's left and down from me. Maybe a bit far.\n- (0,0): way down left.\n- (9,2): right and down.\n- (0,4): left and up a bit.\n- (2,3): left and down.\n\nHmm. The apple at (9,2) is two steps right and five steps down from my head. But maybe there's a path. Alternatively, maybe (5,1) is three left and six down. Not sure. \n\nBut perhaps the immediate direction should be to avoid the enemy. The enemy's head is at (9,9). If they are moving left, maybe they are approaching my area? Or maybe not. Let's see their body. Their body is at (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), etc. So they are moving left and then down. Their next move could be LEFT again, taking them to (5,9) perhaps? Wait, their current head is (9,9). If they move LEFT, they go to (8,9), but that's already part of their body. Wait, no. Wait, each turn, all snakes move simultaneously. The enemy's current head is (9,9). If they move LEFT, their new head would be (8,9), which is currently their first body segment. But if they move into their own body, that would kill them. Wait, but the rules say that if a snake's head moves into any part of their own body (including the cell directly behind their head), they die. So moving into their own body is bad. So the enemy's move can't be into their own body. So their possible moves are directions that don't hit their own body. \n\nWait, the enemy's body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]. So their current body segments are from (9,9) (head) to (1,7) (tail). So if they move LEFT, their new head would be (8,9), which is their current first body segment. That would be moving into their own body, which is invalid. So they can't move LEFT. Similarly, moving DOWN would take them to (9,8). Let's check if that's part of their body. Their body has (5,8), (4,8), etc. (9,8) is not in their body. So maybe they can move DOWN. Alternatively, maybe they can move in other directions. \n\nBut perhaps the enemy is moving towards me. Their current head is at (9,9), which is top right. My head is at (7,7). If they move DOWN, they go to (9,8). That's still away from me. Alternatively, maybe they are planning to go left. But their movement is constrained by their own body. \n\nBack to my own moves. My last move was LEFT. So I moved from (7,7) to (6,7)? Wait, no. Wait, the last move's direction was LEFT. So if my head was at (7,7) before the move, moving LEFT would take me to (6,7). But looking at the current head position, it's (7,7). So maybe the last move was from (8,7) to (7,7)? Wait, the body after the head is (8,7), then (8,8), etc. So the head was at (7,7) after the last move. So the previous head position was (8,7), and moving LEFT to (7,7). That makes sense. \n\nSo now, my current head is (7,7). The next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety.\n\nFirst, check if moving in any direction would cause an immediate death.\n\nUP: (7,8). Is that in my body? My body is [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]. So (7,6) is part of my body. (7,8) is not. So moving UP to (7,8) is safe. But need to check if that's in the enemy's body. The enemy's body includes (7,9), (6,9), etc. (7,8) is not in their body. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN: (7,6). But (7,6) is part of my own body. So moving DOWN would make me hit myself. So that's invalid. So DOWN is out.\n\nLEFT: (6,7). Is that in my body? My body includes (6,6), (5,6), etc. So (6,7) is not. So LEFT is possible. But need to check if enemy's body is there. The enemy's body is as listed. They have (1,7) as their tail. So (6,7) is not in their body. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT: (8,7). That's my current first body segment. So moving RIGHT would take me into (8,7), which is my own body. So that's invalid. So RIGHT is out.\n\nSo possible moves are UP and LEFT. DOWN and RIGHT are invalid.\n\nNow between UP and LEFT. Which is better?\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,8). Then next turn, possible moves? Let's think. If I go up, I might be moving towards the apple at (9,2)? Not directly. Alternatively, maybe towards other apples. But (7,8) is closer to (9,8) which is part of the enemy's body? Wait, enemy's body includes (9,8)? No, their body is (5,8), (4,8), etc. So (9,8) is not part of their body. So moving up to (7,8) is safe. But then, from there, possible moves? Maybe towards (9,2) apple? That's two steps right and six down. Or maybe towards (5,1) which is left and down. \n\nOption 2: Move LEFT to (6,7). From there, possible moves. Let's see. The apple at (5,1) is three left and six down. Or (2,3) is four left and four down. Maybe that's a path. \n\nBut also, need to consider the enemy's movement. If the enemy is moving towards me, maybe moving LEFT would take me away from their path. Alternatively, moving UP might put me in a position where the enemy could collide with me next turn. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apples are more accessible in one direction. Let's check the apples again. The apples are at (5,1), (0,0), (9,2), (0,4), (2,3). \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next turn I could move down towards (5,7), then (5,6), but that's part of my body. Wait, no. If I move LEFT to (6,7), then my next move could be DOWN to (6,6) which is part of my body. So that's bad. So maybe after moving LEFT, the next move would have to be LEFT again or UP or something. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) allows me to maybe go RIGHT next, but (8,8) is part of my body. So that's not possible. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's a way to start moving towards the apples on the left side. For example, (5,1), (2,3), (0,4) are all on the left side. If I move LEFT, I can start moving towards those. \n\nBut also, the enemy's position. If I move LEFT to (6,7), then next turn, the enemy might move in a way that they could approach me. For example, if the enemy moves DOWN to (9,8), then next turn they might move LEFT again, but their body is (8,9), (7,9), etc. So maybe they can't move LEFT again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is safer in terms of not getting into a position where the enemy can hit me. \n\nAnother factor: after moving UP or LEFT, what are the possible future moves. For example, if I move UP to (7,8), then next turn I can't move DOWN (since that would go back to (7,7), which is my previous head position, but wait, after moving UP, my body would be [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. So moving DOWN from (7,8) would go to (7,7), which is now part of my body. So that's invalid. So after moving UP, possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next turn, possible moves could be LEFT again, or UP or DOWN. But DOWN would go to (6,6), which is part of my body. So that's invalid. So possible moves would be LEFT or UP. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's moving towards the left apples. Let's see the distance to each apple:\n\nCurrent head at (7,7):\n\n- (5,1): distance is 2 left and 6 down. Manhattan distance 8.\n- (0,0): 7 left and 7 down. Manhattan 14.\n- (9,2): 2 right and 5 down. Manhattan 7.\n- (0,4): 7 left and 3 up. Manhattan 10.\n- (2,3): 5 left and 4 down. Manhattan 9.\n\nSo the closest apple is (9,2) with a Manhattan distance of 7. Then (2,3) is 9, (5,1) is 8. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), the distance to (9,2) becomes 3 right and 5 down (Manhattan 8). The distance to (5,1) is 1 left and 6 down (Manhattan 7). So maybe that's closer. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (7,8), the distance to (9,2) is 2 right and 6 down (Manhattan 8). The distance to (5,1) is 2 left and 7 down (Manhattan 9). \n\nSo moving LEFT brings me closer to (5,1) and (2,3), while moving UP brings me closer to (9,2) but not as much. \n\nBut maybe (9,2) is easier to reach. Let's see. From (7,7), moving RIGHT is invalid. So to reach (9,2), I need to go right twice and down five times. But moving LEFT first would take me away from that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,2) is in a position where the enemy might be approaching. If the enemy is at (9,9), moving DOWN towards (9,8), then maybe they could head towards (9,2) if possible. But their body is long, so maybe they can't reach there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better to avoid the enemy. The enemy's head is at (9,9), which is two steps right and two steps up from my current position. If I move LEFT, I'm moving away from their direction. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy's body is quite long. If they are moving LEFT, their next head would be (8,9), but that's part of their body. Wait, no. The enemy's current head is (9,9). If they move LEFT, their new head is (8,9), which is their current first body segment. That would be moving into their own body, which is invalid. So the enemy cannot move LEFT. So their possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT? Wait, let's check. \n\nEnemy's head is (9,9). Their body is [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]. So moving LEFT would take them to (8,9), which is their first body segment. So that's invalid. So they can't move LEFT. \n\nWhat about moving DOWN? (9,8). Is that part of their body? Their body has (5,8), (4,8), etc. So (9,8) is not in their body. So they can move DOWN. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT would take them to (10,9), which is off the board. So invalid. \n\nSo the enemy's possible moves are DOWN or maybe UP. Wait, moving UP would take them to (9,10), which is off the board. So invalid. So the enemy can only move DOWN. \n\nWait, that's a key point. The enemy's only possible move is DOWN. Because moving LEFT is into their body, moving UP is off the board, and moving RIGHT is off the board. So the enemy must move DOWN to (9,8). \n\nSo in the next turn, the enemy will be at (9,8). Their body will shift, so their new body will be [(9,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. \n\nSo after this move, the enemy's head is (9,8), and their body is following. \n\nSo in the next turn, if I move LEFT to (6,7), then the enemy is moving to (9,8). Are they in a position to collide with me? Probably not. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (7,8), then the enemy is at (9,8). So the distance between me and the enemy is (7,8) vs (9,8) \u2014 two steps apart. So that's safe. \n\nBut in the next turn, the enemy will move again. If they move DOWN again, they would go to (9,7). But (9,7) is part of my body. Wait, my body after moving UP would be [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. So (9,7) is part of my body. So if the enemy moves to (9,7), that's my body. So that would kill them. But the enemy's move is DOWN to (9,8), then next turn they can't move DOWN again (since (9,7) is in my body). So maybe the enemy's next move after (9,8) would be LEFT (to (8,8)), but that's part of their body. Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nAfter the enemy moves to (9,8) in this turn, their next move would be... Let's see. Their body after this turn would be [(9,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So if they move LEFT next, their new head would be (8,8), which is not in their body. So that's possible. \n\nBut in any case, the enemy's movement is constrained. So maybe they can't come near me soon. \n\nSo back to my options. \n\nIf I move UP to (7,8), then next turn I can't move DOWN (since that's (7,7), my previous head). So possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT (but RIGHT is (8,8), which is part of my body now?), or UP again. Wait, after moving UP, my body is [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. So (8,8) is part of my body. So moving RIGHT from (7,8) would take me to (8,8), which is part of my body. So that's invalid. So after moving UP, possible moves are LEFT or UP again. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then my body becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8), ...]. So next move options would be LEFT again, or UP or DOWN. But DOWN would be (6,6), which is part of my body. So possible moves are LEFT or UP. \n\nSo, considering future moves, moving LEFT allows me to potentially head towards the left apples. For example, if I keep moving LEFT, I can reach (5,7), then (5,6) (which is part of my body now?), no. Wait, my body after moving LEFT to (6,7) would be [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. So moving LEFT again to (5,7) would be possible. Then from there, maybe DOWN to (5,6), but that's part of my body. So that's invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP from (6,7) to (6,8) would be possible. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to move towards the apples. The apple at (5,1) is to the left and down. If I move LEFT, I can start moving towards that. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is two steps right and five down. But to reach there, I need to move right twice and down five times. But moving LEFT now would take me away from that. \n\nBut given that the enemy is moving down, maybe they could approach me if I go up. For example, if I move UP to (7,8), then next turn the enemy is at (9,8). If I move LEFT to (7,7) again? Wait, no. If I move UP to (7,8), then next move I can't go back to (7,7) because that's part of my body. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's a direction that allows me to collect apples on the left side, which might be safer. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the apples. The apple at (5,1) is in the lower left. If I move LEFT, I can start moving towards that. But I need to see if there's a path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,3) is closer. From (6,7), moving left and down. \n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to move LEFT to (6,7) now, then next turn move LEFT again to (5,7), then maybe DOWN towards (5,6) (but that's part of my body). Wait, no. If I move LEFT to (5,7), then my body would be [(5,7), (6,7), (7,7), ...]. Then moving DOWN to (5,6) is part of my body (since my body after that move would include (5,7), (6,7), etc. So (5,6) is not part of my body. Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nWait, after moving LEFT to (6,7), my body is [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. So the next move, if I go LEFT again to (5,7), then my body becomes [(5,7), (6,7), (7,7), ...]. Then, moving DOWN to (5,6) would be possible, as that's not in my body. But (5,6) is part of my body from previous steps? No, because after moving to (5,7), the body segments are (5,7) (new head), then (6,7), (7,7), etc. So (5,6) is not in the body. So that's possible. \n\nSo moving LEFT allows me to approach (5,1) apple. But (5,1) is at (5,1). From (5,7), I need to move down 6 steps. But that's a lot. Maybe there are other apples. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,2) is two steps right and five down. If I move LEFT now, I'm moving away from that. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (9,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance. Let me recalculate. \n\nCurrent position (7,7):\n\n- (9,2): dx=2, dy=-5. Manhattan 7.\n- (5,1): dx=-2, dy=-6. Manhattan 8.\n- (2,3): dx=-5, dy=-4. Manhattan 9.\n\nSo (9,2) is the closest. But to reach it, I need to move right twice and down five times. But moving LEFT now would take me away. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to go right and down. But my current body is blocking some paths. \n\nWait, if I move LEFT to (6,7), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,6), but that's part of my body. So no. So maybe after moving LEFT, I have to move LEFT again or UP. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (7,8) allows me to maybe move RIGHT next. Wait, no. After moving UP to (7,8), my body is [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. So moving RIGHT would take me to (8,8), which is part of my body. So that's invalid. So after moving UP, possible moves are LEFT or UP again. \n\nHmm. So between UP and LEFT. \n\nAnother factor: the enemy's movement. If I move UP, the enemy is moving DOWN to (9,8). So the distance between me and the enemy is (7,8) vs (9,8) \u2014 two steps apart. So safe. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), enemy is at (9,8). Distance is 3 steps right and 1 up. So also safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's a direction that allows me to collect apples on the left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is a better target. Let's see. To reach (5,1), I need to get to x=5, y=1. From (7,7), that's 2 left and 6 down. If I move LEFT to (6,7), then next move could be DOWN to (6,6) (but that's part of my body now). So no. So maybe move LEFT again to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), which is not in my body. Then continue down. \n\nBut that would take several moves. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better to avoid any possible collision with the enemy. \n\nWait, but the enemy is moving DOWN. If I move UP, I'm going away from their direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy's movement could lead them towards me. For example, if they keep moving DOWN, they might eventually reach positions that are closer. \n\nBut given that their body is long, maybe they can't reach me soon. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (9,2) is in the same column as the enemy's current head (9,9). So if the enemy moves DOWN, they go to (9,8), then maybe (9,7) next. But (9,7) is part of my body. So if the enemy moves to (9,7), that's my body. So that would kill them. So the enemy can't move to (9,7). \n\nSo the enemy's movement is constrained. They have to move DOWN each time, but after that, their next move would have to avoid their body. \n\nIn any case, for my move, between UP and LEFT. \n\nLet me think about the apple at (9,2). To reach it, I need to move right twice and down five times. But my body is blocking some paths. For example, if I move right to (8,7) (but that's my body, so can't). So I can't move right. So the only way to reach (9,2) is by moving right from some position. But since I can't move right now, maybe that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,2) is not reachable because of my body. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is more reachable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's a direction that allows me to collect apples on the left side. \n\nAnother consideration: the apples collected so far. I have 10, same as the enemy. So need to collect more. \n\nSo, in this turn, which move gives me a better chance to collect an apple next turn? \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), then next turn, possible moves could be LEFT again to (5,7), then maybe DOWN to (5,6), etc. But (5,6) is part of my body? No. Wait, after moving LEFT to (6,7), my body is [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)]. So (5,6) is not in my body. So if I move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6) is possible. \n\nSo from (5,7), moving DOWN to (5,6) is safe. Then from there, maybe continue down towards (5,1). \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (7,8), then next turn I can't move DOWN (to (7,7)), so maybe move LEFT to (6,8). Then from there, maybe move LEFT again. \n\nBut it's unclear. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (9,2) is in row 2, which is two steps below the top. If I can get there, but my movement is constrained. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is LEFT. Because moving UP might not bring me closer to any apple, while moving LEFT brings me closer to (5,1) and (2,3). \n\nBut I need to check if moving LEFT is safe. \n\nYes, moving LEFT to (6,7) is safe. \n\nSo the decision is between UP and LEFT. \n\nAnother factor: the apple at (9,2). If I can reach it, that's an apple. But how? From (7,7), moving RIGHT is invalid. So I can't go directly. Unless I go LEFT and then somehow loop around. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,2) is not reachable in the near future. \n\nSo perhaps moving LEFT is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better to avoid any possible collision. \n\nWait, if I move UP to (7,8), then the enemy is at (9,8). So they are two steps away. If I move UP again, I go to (7,9), which is part of the enemy's body (their body includes (7,9)). So that would be a collision. So moving UP twice would kill me. \n\nSo after moving UP to (7,8), next move can't be UP again. \n\nSo maybe moving LEFT is better. \n\nAlternatively, after moving LEFT to (6,7), next move could be UP to (6,8), which is safe. \n\nBut I need to pick the best move now. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (9,2) is at (9,2). If I can reach that, but given my current movement options, it's not possible. Because to get there, I need to move right twice and down five times. But I can't move right now. \n\nSo perhaps the best bet is to move LEFT towards the left apples. \n\nSo the choice is between UP and LEFT. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (5,1) is in the lower left. If I move LEFT, I can start moving towards that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,4) is also on the left. \n\nSo moving LEFT seems better. \n\nBut wait, what about the apple at (9,2)? If I can't reach it, then focusing on left apples is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to reach (9,2) by moving LEFT and then going around. But I don't see it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is the only safe option. \n\nWait, no. Both UP and LEFT are safe. \n\nSo between UP and LEFT. \n\nAnother consideration: the game's win condition. If I can collect apples faster, that's better. \n\nIf I move LEFT, I can collect apples on the left. If I move UP, maybe I can't reach any apple soon. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is the way to go. \n\nBut I need to think about the next move's options. \n\nIf I choose LEFT now, then next turn I can move LEFT again to (5,7), then maybe DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), but that's part of my body. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, after moving LEFT to (6,7), next move could be UP to (6,8), which is safe. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: the enemy's movement. If I move LEFT, the enemy is moving DOWN. So they are getting closer in the y-axis. But their x is 9, while mine is 6. So not a direct path. \n\nIf I move UP, then the enemy is at (9,8). So they are two steps away in x. \n\nBut maybe the enemy's movement is not a threat. \n\nIn terms of safety, both moves are safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving LEFT is better because it's a direction that allows me to collect apples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving UP is better to avoid any possible future collision. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is the best target. To reach it, I need to move LEFT and DOWN. \n\nSo moving LEFT now is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (5,1) which is three steps left and six down from my current position. If I move LEFT, I can start moving towards that. \n\nSo I think moving LEFT is the better choice here. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. \n\nCurrent head at (7,7). \n\nMove LEFT to (6,7). \n\nNext turn, possible moves: LEFT (5,7), UP (6,8), or maybe DOWN (6,6) which is part of my body. \n\nSo next turn, if I move LEFT to (5,7), then next move could be DOWN to (5,6). \n\nThen from (5,6), maybe move DOWN to (5,5), etc. \n\nBut (5,1) is at (5,1). So that's five steps down from (5,6). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (5,1) which is three steps left and six down. \n\nBut perhaps it's worth pursuing. \n\nAlternatively, if I move UP, I might not get closer to any apple. \n\nSo I think the better move is LEFT. \n\nBut wait, another thing: the apple at (9,2) is two steps right and five down. If I can find a way to reach that. But given my current position and body, moving right is blocked. \n\nSo maybe LEFT is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (5,1) is more accessible. \n\nSo I think the answer is LEFT.\nLEFT",
