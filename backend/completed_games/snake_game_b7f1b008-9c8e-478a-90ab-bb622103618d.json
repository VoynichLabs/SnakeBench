My previous UP move was successful and put me in a good central position.\n\nCurrent state:\n- My snake head: (4, 8) with body at [(4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)]\n- Enemy snake #1: (1, 5) with body at [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4)] - they moved RIGHT from (0, 5) to (1, 5)\n- Remaining apples: (2, 8), (3, 9), (6, 1), (7, 9), (8, 3)\n\nFrom position (4, 8), let me evaluate my options:\n- UP: (4, 9) - Safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN: (4, 7) - Would hit my own body! DEATH\n- LEFT: (3, 8) - Safe, no obstacles\n- RIGHT: (5, 8) - Safe, no obstacles\n\nSo I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT safely.\n\nLooking at the nearby apples:\n1. Apple at (2, 8): I can reach it by going LEFT to (3, 8), then LEFT to (2, 8). That's 2 moves total.\n2. Apple at (3, 9): I can reach it by going LEFT to (3, 8), then UP to (3, 9). That's also 2 moves.\n3. Apple at (7, 9): I can reach it by going UP to (4, 9), then RIGHT multiple times. That's 4 moves total.\n\nThe closest apples are both at (2, 8) and (3, 9), each requiring 2 moves. However, I notice that if I move LEFT to (3, 8), I'll be in an excellent position where I can choose between both apples on my next turn:\n- From (3, 8), I can go LEFT to get (2, 8)\n- From (3, 8), I can go UP to get (3, 9)\n\nThis gives me maximum flexibility and allows me to react to what the enemy snake does. The enemy snake is currently at (1, 5) and seems to be moving around the lower-left area, so they're not an immediate threat to either of these apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 8) positions me optimally between two equally valuable targets.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (3, 8), choose between going LEFT to (2, 8) or UP to (3, 9) based on enemy positioning and which apple seems safer to collect.\n\nLEFT"
