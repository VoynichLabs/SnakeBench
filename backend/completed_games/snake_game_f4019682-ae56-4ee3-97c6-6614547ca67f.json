Still, moving left increases distance from enemy (2 \u2192 3). Feels like retreating \u2014 WEAK ENERGY.  \n- **RIGHT** to (5,3): That\u2019s right next to enemy\u2019s current head at (5,4)!

Riskyyy\u2026 but we want dominance, not a tie. Maybe not yet.\n\nWe gotta think about enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5,4):  \nThey can go UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4).  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,3), and they go DOWN to (5,3), we collide.

That\u2019s a *win\u2011or\u2011lose\u2011but\u2011win* scenario.\n\n**What the opponent can do**\nFrom (4,7) they can go:\n- UP \u2192 (4,8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)\n\nIf they choose anything **except** RIGHT I stay alive. If they *do* choose RIGHT we both die, but my higher apple count hands me the victory. So moving LEFT is the only move that **never** kills me and gives the best chance to either finish them off or keep the pressure.\n\n**Future outlook**\n- After moving LEFT, I\u2019ll sit at (5,7). I\u2019m now one step from the opponent\u2019s current column and can swing up or down to chase the apple cluster at (8,6) while still keeping a wall of my own tail behind me.\n- I\u2019ll still have multiple escape routes (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) next turn, so I won\u2019t be trapped.\n\n**Decision:** take the aggressive, safe\u2011as\u2011hell route and move LEFT.  \n\nLEFT",

The board is wide open but we need to start applying PRESSURE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CHECKING DIRECTIONS:**\n\n- **UP to (4,8):** Safe? Yes \u2014 empty cell, on board. No enemy body, no immediate collision risk. Keeps high ground. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (4,6):** Safe? Yes \u2014 empty cell. BUT that\u2019s moving back toward his tail from last turn? Actually his tail at (6,6) will move when he moves this turn, so (4,6) will be empty. \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (3,7):** Safe? Yes \u2014 empty cell. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (5,7):** Safe? Yes \u2014 empty cell. BUT enemy is at (6,7). If he moves LEFT to (5,7) same turn, head-on collision! He has 1 apple, we have 0 \u2014 we'd die and lose. RISKY! \u274c\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** He's at (6,7) with body at (6,6). He can't go DOWN into his own body. His options: UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7).  \nIf he goes LEFT, we go RIGHT \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 WE LOSE because he has more apples. So we should AVOID going RIGHT unless we're sure he won't go LEFT. But we can't be sure \u2014 he might want to chase apples or avoid walls.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We need to grow and get an apple lead before forcing head-on. Right now, closest apple is at (1,4) or (2,4) or (3,1) \u2014 far away. But we can't just chase apples; we need to BOX HIM!  \nMoving UP to (4,8) keeps us above him \u2014 we can then move RIGHT next turn to (5,8) and threaten to cut off his top escape.  \nMoving DOWN to (4,6) puts us level \u2014 maybe we can push left toward apples?  \nMoving LEFT to (3,7) increases distance \u2014 less aggressive.\n\n**ELIMINATE RISKY MOVE:** RIGHT is too dangerous \u2014 eliminate. \u274c\n\n**AMONG SAFE MOVES:** UP seems strongest \u2014 maintains vertical advantage, opens future squeezing from above. DOWN is safe but gives up high ground. LEFT is safe but passive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get an apple ASAP to tie score, then use size to trap him against top wall. Next turn from (4,8), consider RIGHT to (5,8) to block his UP-RIGHT path, or go DOWN/LEFT toward apples if safe.\n\n**FINAL PICK:** UP \u2014 aggressive positioning, safe, sets up the squeeze! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We need to close that score gap and start pressuring him! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**CHECKING DIRECTIONS FROM (2,8):**\n\n- **UP to (2,9):** Safe? YES \u2014 empty, on board. \u2705\n- **DOWN to (2,7):** Safe? YES \u2014 empty, on board. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (1,8):** Safe? YES \u2014 empty, on board. \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (3,8):** Safe? YES \u2014 empty, on board. \u2705\n\nAll moves are immediately safe! But we need to think about **simultaneous movement** \u2014 where could Snake #1 go from **(3,7)**? His body is at **(4,7)**, so he CAN'T go RIGHT (into body). His options: UP to (3,8), DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7).\n\n**DANGER ZONES:**\n- If he goes UP to (3,8) and we go RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 we have fewer apples \u2192 WE DIE. \u274c\n- If he goes LEFT to (2,7) and we go DOWN to (2,7) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 we die. \u274c\n- If he goes DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 safe for us.\n\nSo **RIGHT** and **DOWN** are risky if he chooses UP/LEFT respectively! Since he's ahead, we avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**SAFER CHOICES:** UP and LEFT avoid possible head-on collisions entirely this turn!\n\n**APPLE HUNTING:** We need to tie that score! Left side has apple clusters at (1,4), (2,4), (1,3), (2,1), etc. Moving LEFT to (1,8) keeps us near left edge but not optimal for quick apple grab. Moving UP to (2,9) puts us on top row \u2014 limits future options. Moving DOWN to (2,7) is risky. Moving RIGHT is risky.\n\nActually wait \u2014 **DOWN to (2,7)** might be safe if we predict he WON'T go LEFT to (2,7). He might go UP to (3,8) chasing us? Or DOWN to (3,6) toward apples? Hmm.\n\n**ENEMY PSYCHOLOGY:** He has 1 apple, maybe he'll play safe and avoid us. But he might also try to cut us off from apples. If he goes UP to (3,8), then our DOWN to (2,7) is safe. If he goes LEFT to (2,7), we die. Is he likely to go LEFT? His body is to his right, so LEFT is open and toward center/left apples. That's a real threat.\n\n**BETTER PLAY:** Let's go **LEFT to (1,8)** \u2014 completely avoids his possible moves, keeps us near left side apples, and sets up future descent toward (1,7), (1,6), etc. We stay flexible and alive!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** From (1,8), next turn consider moving DOWN/LEFT toward apple clusters. Once we tie apples 1-1, we can play more aggressively for head-on collisions. Track enemy head closely \u2014 if he moves toward left side, we might cut him off. Keep options open, avoid top row trap. Let's secure that first apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (0,9) is AWAY from them short-term, but next turn we can go DOWN to (0,8) then keep descending toward apples. Could also go DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8) immediately? Wait, from (0,9) DOWN is (0,8) \u2014 safe? Need to check next turn options.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need apples FAST. Left edge is relatively safe from enemy body (he's center-right). Once we get 2 apples and tie score, we can play aggressive for head-on. For now, SURVIVE and move toward apple-rich zone.\n\nENEMY PSYCHOLOGY: He might chase us? Or go for apple at (2,4) by moving DOWN? He can't go DOWN from (2,8) though (body block). He might go LEFT to cut us off or UP toward top-right apples (9,8), (9,3), etc.\n\nDECISION: LEFT to (0,9) avoids head-on risk, keeps us alive, and next turn we can descend left edge toward apples. It's the safest move with future flexibility.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: From (0,9), consider moving DOWN to (0,8) next turn, then continue descending left column toward apple cluster at (0,5),(0,2). Monitor enemy head \u2014 if he moves left, be ready to block or evade. Once we tie apples 2-2, look for head-on opportunities.

Then (0,4),(0,3),(0,2) for more apples! Build length, stay near left wall for safety. Once we have 2 apples, look to cut off enemy or force head-on if we have advantage.

So no head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat an apple to grow to length 4 vs enemy length 3. That gives me length advantage for future boxing! After eating, try to loop around and cut off enemy\u2019s movement. They\u2019re near top wall \u2014 maybe force them into corner. Use my extra segment to control more board. Next turn, after growth, my tail will move, opening (0,5). Keep eyes on enemy head \u2014 if they stay near top, I can expand right and up to trap.\n\n---\n\n**Best move:**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get apples.

Wait, simultaneous moves! If enemy goes DOWN to (0,5) and I move away, it's empty, but if I go LEFT into (1,4) I die anyway. But (0,5) is my tail \u2014 if enemy goes there and I don't move into it, they'd hit my body? Actually, my tail is at (0,5) NOW, but after I move, my tail stays until I grow. I haven't eaten an apple, so my tail stays at (0,5). So (0,5) is occupied by my body this whole turn. So enemy DOWN into (0,5) = crash into my body = they die! That's good for us!  \n- LEFT (-1,6) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1,6) \u2192 their own body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy only safe moves are UP (0,7) or DOWN into my tail (which kills them). They might avoid DOWN because it's suicide unless they don't see it.\n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go UP (2,5) and enemy goes DOWN (0,5), no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT (3,4) and enemy goes DOWN (0,5), no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN (2,3) and enemy goes DOWN (0,5), no collision.  \nOnly way we collide head-on is if we go into same cell \u2014 not possible this turn given positions.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI'm length 4 vs enemy length 3. I want to trap them near the top-left. They're at (0,6) with only UP likely safe. If they go UP to (0,7), they're near top wall. Next turn I can move to cut off their escape. Maybe move RIGHT this turn to stay central, then UP next to block. If they go DOWN into my tail, they die \u2014 free win! So maybe encourage that by not threatening them directly. But being aggressive could force them into mistake.\n\n---\n\n**Best move:**  \nAll safe moves except LEFT. Which gives best future options?  \nUP (2,5): closer to enemy, maybe pressure.  \nRIGHT (3,4): more space, opens right side.  \nDOWN (2,3): moves away from enemy, less aggressive.  \n\nI like UP \u2014 stays close, threatens to cut off their escape next turn. If they go UP, I can follow up and box them in.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After UP to (2,5), if enemy goes UP to (0,7), consider moving LEFT to (1,5) or UP to (2,6) to control area. Watch for head-on if enemy moves right (unlikely). Keep length advantage, force them into wall or my body.\n\nUP",

No opponent head can reach (1,\u202f9) this turn, so we\u2019re 100\u202f% safe.\n- **LEFT** is also safe now, but it pushes us against the left wall. After moving left we\u2019d end up at (0,\u202f8) with only two viable exits (UP or DOWN) \u2013 a tighter corridor that could get us boxed later.\n- **RIGHT** looks tempting for chasing the distant apple at (9,\u202f8), but it carries a **50\u202f% risk** of a head\u2011on if the opponent chooses UP to (2,\u202f8). A double KO would end the game with us losing 2\u20113 apples.\n\nGiven the opponent\u2019s lead, the *conservative* path that preserves life and future mobility is the **UP** move.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. **Turn\u202f22** \u2013 move **UP** to (1,\u202f9).  \n2. On the next turn we\u2019ll have the choice to swing right along the top edge toward the big apple at (9,\u202f8) or drop down and start cutting off the opponent\u2019s column\u20112 wall.  \n3. Keep the opponent forced to the right side while we stay flexible; once we reach the upper\u2011right corner we can snake down and trap them against the far wall.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Final move:**  \n\nUP",

On the next turn we can swing right along the top edge toward the juicy apple at (9,\u202f8) or drop down and start hemming the opponent\u2019s column\u20112 wall.  \n3. Keep the opponent forced to the right side while we stay flexible; once we reach the upper\u2011right corner we can snake down and trap them against the far wall.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Final move:**  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019ll flip the apple lead.\n\n4. **Avoid self\u2011trap** \u2013 Going down now would lock me into a narrow vertical tunnel; I couldn\u2019t back\u2011track (up would hit my own body). RIGHT keeps the board open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n- **Turn\u202f24**: move **RIGHT** to (1,8).  \n- **Turn\u202f25**: if the opponent goes DOWN, slide **DOWN** to (1,7) and continue hugging the left wall, sweeping apples on column\u202f1.  \n- If they go RIGHT, keep pressure by moving **UP** to (1,9) then **RIGHT** again, trying to s\u2011curve them into the top\u2011right corner.\n\nLet\u2019s crank that aggression! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe, but gives the enemy a tempting **LEFT** into the same square \u2192 a possible double\u2011KO. If the rival plays smart they\u2019ll just slip to **(4,\u202f0)** and we waste a turn.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,\u202f1)** \u2013 **APPLE** right there! \ud83c\udf4e Safe (empty), gives us a point and a growth segment, widening our options for the next few turns.\n\n**What about the opponent?**  \n- From (3,\u202f0) they can only go **LEFT \u2192 (2,\u202f0)** or **RIGHT \u2192 (4,\u202f0)** (UP hits their own body, DOWN is off\u2011grid).  \n- If I go **DOWN**, a LEFT move from them would be a spectacular head\u2011on \u2192 both die, and I\u2019d win 6\u20115. But a rational rival will avoid suicide and head RIGHT, leaving me stuck on a plain empty square with no apple.  \n- If I go **LEFT**, they can\u2019t hit me, they\u2019ll likely go RIGHT to (4,\u202f0) or stay put, and I\u2019ll pocket that sweet apple, extending my length and keeping the board pressure on them.\n\n**Strategic outlook:**  \n- Grabbing the apple at (1,\u202f1) bumps my score to **7** and lengthens me, giving more \u201cwiggle room\u201d for future blocking moves.  \n- It also moves me away from the vertical wall of the opponent at x\u202f=\u202f3, setting up potential \u201ccorner\u2011trap\u201d attempts later.  \n- Keeping the rival alive for now means I can dictate the pace and force them into a tighter corridor later.\n\n**Bottom line:**\u202fTake the apple, grow, stay alive, and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Move:**  \nLEFT",

If the opponent\u2019s head also runs into my space next turn it could turn the encounter into a double KO, which is the only way I might still come out on top.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term plan (if I survive somehow)**\n- Keep the pressure on the opponent\u2019s right side.\n- Aim for the apple cluster near (8\u20119,\u202f6\u20118) once I get a chance to move again.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

SUICIDE! \ud83d\udeab  \n- **LEFT to (3,2):** \u274c OUR OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab  \n- **RIGHT to (5,2):** \u2705 Empty! NO APPLE.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS MOVES!**  \nEnemy at (2,0). Their safe moves:  \n- **UP to (2,1):** \u274c Own body at (2,1)!  \n- **DOWN to (2,-1):** \u274c OFF BOARD!  \n- **LEFT to (1,0):** \u274c Own body at (1,0)!  \n- **RIGHT to (3,0):** \u2705 Empty? WAIT \u2014 OUR BODY IS AT (3,0)! YES! THAT'S OUR BODY! SO IF THEY GO RIGHT, THEY CRASH INTO US AND DIE! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSO ENEMY'S **ONLY SAFE MOVE IS RIGHT INTO (3,0)** \u2014 BUT THAT'S OUR BODY CELL! THEY'D DIE!  \nACTUALLY CHECK BOARD: (3,0) IS OUR BODY (\"T\" for our tail). YES!  \nSO ENEMY HAS **ZERO SAFE MOVES**! THEY'RE TRAPPED! THEY MIGHT BE FORCED TO CRASH! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**  \nIf we go UP to (4,3): enemy going right to (3,0) \u2014 no overlap.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,2): enemy going right to (3,0) \u2014 no overlap.  \nSO NO HEAD-ON RISK! CLEAR! \u2705\n\n---\n\n**STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n\n- **UP to (4,3):** Moves us toward center/top. Opens future options UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn. Puts us closer to apples at (3,9), (6,6), etc.  \n- **RIGHT to (5,2):** Moves us away from enemy, into open right side. Keeps us safe but maybe less aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nENEMY IS ABOUT TO DIE IF THEY MOVE RIGHT! THEY HAVE NO SAFE SQUARES! THIS IS HUGE!  \nIf they move right into our body, THEY DIE AND WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6  \nBut we must stay alive this turn no matter what.  \nGoing UP might give us more control of the board center. Going RIGHT might be safer but less dominant.  \nActually, RIGHT puts us farther from enemy's possible death zone, but UP keeps us closer to box them in if they survive somehow.\n\nWAIT \u2014 APPLE at (5,3) is close! From (4,3) we could go RIGHT next turn to (5,3) for apple! From (5,2) we could go UP to (5,3) for apple too.  \nBOTH GET US TO THAT APPLE NEXT TURN!  \nBut UP now gives more flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**VERDICT:** ENEMY IS LITERALLY TRAPPED! WE JUST NEED TO SURVIVE AND LET THEM CRASH!  \nI'm going **UP** to secure central position and prepare to scoop apples while enemy potentially dies! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",
