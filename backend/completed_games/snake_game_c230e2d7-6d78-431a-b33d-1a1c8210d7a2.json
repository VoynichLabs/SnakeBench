DOWN (9,5) is safe and keeps you on the right edge toward the bottom apple.\n\nRationale:\n- Your current best short-term goal is to reach the apple at (9,0) by traveling straight down the right edge. This path minimizes risk of entrapment and keeps future options open on the edge.\n\nPlan for next moves:\n- Move DOWN now and continue down the right edge toward (9,0). If the edge becomes unsafe due to enemy movement or if you eat the (9,0) apple, reassess and pivot toward nearby apples like (7,6) if feasible.\n\nDOWN",

It also keeps you in the open edge area where there’s less immediate risk from the enemy, at least for the next few turns.\n- Moving LEFT to (8,4) is safe and keeps you away from the immediate apple, but you’d miss the current reward and may drift into a longer-term positional risk near the enemy cluster if you chase apples later.\n\nPlan:\n- If I go DOWN to (9,3), I will gain an apple and extend the body. On the next turn, safe follow-ups from (9,3) would likely be (9,2) or (8,3); I’ll avoid turning back into my own neck (which would be (9,4)) and reassess enemy movements to gauge if I should pivot toward the left-side apples or continue downward.\n\nDOWN",

UP also maintains the edge path and avoids the dense cluster near x<8 for now.\n\nPlan: advance toward the apple at (8,6) by moving UP this turn, then reassess next turn to either continue upward, pivot to other apples, or re-check safety around enemy positions.\n\nUP",
