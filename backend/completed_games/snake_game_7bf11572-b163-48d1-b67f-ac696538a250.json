Good choice.\n- RIGHT (6,2): moves me directly above the (6,1) apple, keeping the immediate option to go DOWN and take that apple next turn. From (6,2) I also have LEFT and UP (UP->6,3 is free) as alternatives, so it preserves good mobility while heading toward the lower-right apple cluster.\n\nDecision and short plan:\n- I prefer RIGHT to (6,2).
