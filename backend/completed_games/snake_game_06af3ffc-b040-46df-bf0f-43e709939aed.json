We are chilling at (9, 6). We got space, but we need to start putting pressure on that little guy!\n\nBoard is 10x10. We need to box him in! Remember the rules: simultaneous movement! We gotta predict where that scrub is going to move!\n\n**Our position:** (9, 6). Head only, so no self-collision issues yet!\n**Enemy position:** (3, 2).\n\nLet's analyze potential moves for us and him.\n\n**Our options from (9, 6):**\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** Safe. Opens up more vertical space.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** Safe. Moves us towards the center mass of apples.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** Safe. Moves us towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** **OUT OF BOUNDS! DEAD! FAIL!** (We don't do dumb moves here, chat!)\n\n**Enemy options from (3, 2):**\nHe's low and relatively central. He might try to dip down towards those apples at (3, 0), or snake towards us (7, 2) and (8, 2).\n\n*   If he goes **UP (3, 3)**.\n*   If he goes **DOWN (3, 1)**.\n*   If he goes **LEFT (2, 2)**.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT (4, 2)** towards the A at (7, 2) line.\n\nWe want to cut off his escape routes! Since we are on the far right edge, moving LEFT seems like the most aggressive way to start closing the distance towards his weak center position without falling immediately into a potential trap if he surprises us. Moving UP or DOWN keeps us hugging the edge for now.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (8, 6)**: We are headed towards the middle. (3, 2) is pretty far. We don't want to rush straight into a terrible position.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (9, 5)**: This brings us closer to the lower apple cluster, and generally towards the center of the map. This feels less committal than moving left, allowing us to react better to his first *actual* move.\n\nLet's look at the apples near us. (1, 6) is far. The main action seems to be in the lower left quadrant. We are on the RIGHT side. We should start migrating left and down to control the map center.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (8, 6)**, and he moves **RIGHT to (4, 2)**, we close the gap by 2 cells horizontally. That's good pressure!\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (9, 5)**, and he moves an aggressive **UP to (3, 3)**, the gap remains 6 vertically, 6 horizontally. Less pressure.\n\nWe need to exert pressure. Since we have no body, we can afford to move aggressively towards the center line. Moving LEFT gets us closer to that 3 column where he is located.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Initial aggressive positioning. Move towards the enemy's sector (left) to divide the board. Avoid apples for now; we focus on aggression and board control. Don't let him eat first!\n\nLet's commit to the **LEFT** move. We go to (8, 6). This forces him to react to our encroachment into the center-right area. Let's see what chaos ensues! Are you ready for the collision, Snake #1?!\n\nLEFT it is! Time to hunt! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

I'm at (3,2), enemy is at (9,6). Board is loaded with apples! My score vs enemy score is 0-0, so I need to play smart and aggressive.\n\n**Check my safe moves:**\n- **UP to (3,3)**: Safe! No body, no enemy. Good open space above.\n- **DOWN to (3,1)**: Safe! No body, no enemy. Also open.\n- **LEFT to (2,2)**: Safe! No body, no enemy. But there's an apple at (2,5) above, so going LEFT could lead up.\n- **RIGHT to (4,2)**: Safe! No body, no enemy. Also open.\n\nAll four moves are safe! Now, let's think strategy. I want to dominate the board and force the enemy into traps. The enemy is far right at (9,6), so they're likely going for apples on the right side. I should control the center/left and cut off their escape routes.\n\nLooking at apples: (2,5) is above-left of me, (3,0) is below-left, (1,2) is left, (1,5) is left-up. Tons of apples left side! Going LEFT or UP seems smart to claim that territory.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Control left side, eat apples quickly to grow, then push right to trap the enemy against the wall. Force a head-on collision when I'm bigger!\n\n**MY MOVE:** LEFT to (2,2)! It connects me towards multiple apples and keeps options open. Let's gooo!\n\nLEFT",

Our last move was LEFT, putting us tentatively at (8, 6) assuming the enemy didn't move into us instantly (which they couldn't, they were at (3, 2)!).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the current board state based on the simultaneous move!\n\n**PREVIOUS LOCATIONS:**\n*   My Head (ID 0): (9, 6)\n*   Snake #1 Head: (3, 2)\n\n**LAST MOVE PICKED (US):** LEFT. (If this move was successful, our new head location is (8, 6).)\n\nSince we didn't receive an updated board state or enemy move, we must assume the *previous* turn's FINAL configuration holds true, and the \"LAST MOVE PICK\" section was the *decision process for the move we are now simulating*.\n\n**HOLD UP, CHAT!** The prompt structure implies we are now deciding Turn 1's move, and the 'LAST MOVE' section was the *hypothetical decision process for Turn 0*, which resulted in the positions listed for Turn 1!\n\n**CONFIRMING TURN 1 POSITIONS:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (8, 6) <-- This confirms our LAST MOVE (LEFT from 9,6) must have landed us here successfully!\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (2, 2) <-- Wait, the initial board shows (3, 2). If our rival moved RIGHT from (3, 2) to (3, 3), UP to (3, 1), DOWN to (3, 1), or LEFT to (2, 2). The provided board state shows Snake #1 at (2, 2). This means **Snake #1 moved LEFT** from (3, 2) to (2, 2)! Sneaky!\n\nOkay, the board state reflected after Turn 1 movement is:\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (8, 6)\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (2, 2)\n*   **Scores:** 0 - 0. No apples eaten yet by anyone!\n\nWe are on Turn 2 now! Time to put the hammer down! We are on the right side (X=8), he is on the left side (X=2). We've closed the gap slightly horizontally, but we are still very far apart compared to the 10-unit width.\n\n**Current Map Analysis (Turn 2 Start):**\n*   **US (8, 6):** Safe zone. We have a lot of space above and below.\n*   **RIVAL (2, 2):** He's low and towards the center-left. He has apples surrounding him: A at (2, 5), A at (1, 8), A at (0, 2).\n\n**STRATEGY:** We need to make assertive moves to take control of the center column (4 or 5) or force him into a bad corner. Since we are still equal on body size (just heads), this is a game of positioning. We must NOT let him eat apples uncontested while we take the long way around.\n\n**Our Options from (8, 6):**\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** Keeps us near the top edge. Good for space.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 5):** Moves us towards the center mass of potential conflict and apples.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** Aggressively closing the horizontal distance toward him (X=2).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** Retreating towards the edge. Waste of time.\n\n**RIVAL's Likely Moves from (2, 2):**\nHe is low. He might go UP (2, 3) or RIGHT (3, 2) to start eating the apples around the bottom half. If he sees us moving aggressively left/center, he might move RIGHT (3, 2) to try and meet us in the middle-right.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nIf we go **LEFT to (7, 6)**, we are making the most aggressive centralized move. We are 5 columns away from him (X=7 vs X=2).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (3, 2) to try and meet us, the gap closes to 4 columns. This is good pressure!\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (8, 5)**, we are aiming for the juicy middle area where A(5, 6) and A(1, 5) are. This lets him potentially control the top half of the board if he surges UP.\n\nLet's focus on the horizontal divide. Since we are higher up (Y=6 vs Y=2), moving left closes the gap across the board much faster than moving vertically. We need to get closer to challenge his local area control.\n\nI like the aggressive push LEFT to **(7, 6)**. We are putting ourselves in position to intercept paths towards the middle-left apples or force him to run away from us. We risk nothing this early, as we have no body to bump into!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Maintain aggressive forward positioning towards the center mass of the board. Focus on forcing the head-to-head confrontation when our score advantage is guaranteed (which is now score 0-0, so we dictate the opening pace). Control the central X-axis lanes.\n\nLet's smash that LEFT button again! Get in his face!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Board is POPPIN' with apples everywhere!\n\n**SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP to (2,3)**: Safe! Clear above me.\n- **DOWN to (2,1)**: Safe! But there's an apple at (1,2) that would become unreachable if I go down, and I'd be moving away from the apple cluster.\n- **LEFT to (1,2)**: **APPLE HERE!** This would give me my first point and grow my body. Safe since enemy is far right.\n- **RIGHT to (3,2)**: Safe! But this is back to my previous position - no strategic gain.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (8,6) - way on the right side. They're probably eyeing apples on the right (7,4), (7,2), (9,2), (8,2), etc. I need to dominate the LEFT side where there are TONS of apples: (1,2), (1,5), (1,8), (0,9), (0,2), (3,0), etc.\n\nBy going LEFT to (1,2) and eating that apple, I get my first point and grow my body. This sets me up to climb the left wall and claim all those apples before the enemy can reach them. When I'm bigger and control the left flank, I can push right and trap them against the wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat left-side apples first, grow to at least 3-4 segments, then dominate center and push right.

Let's see where that puts us!\n\nBased on the board state provided, it seems our last move resulted in us landing at (8, 6) and the rival landing slightly away at (2, 2). NO APPLES EATEN YET! This is still the early game, pure positioning battle! We are UP 0 to his 1 apple eaten (Wait, the score says *Your snake 0 apples, Snake #1 1 apple.* This means Snake #1 MUST have eaten the apple at (7, 4) or (7, 2) or (9, 2) or (7, 1) or (7, 8) or any other apple that was near (3, 2) *before* our move landed us at (8, 6)! This is crucial! He's already up!\n\nLet's re-examine the Apple list vs Board State vs Score:\nApple List: (1, 6), (7, 4), (7, 2), (0, 9), (3, 0), (1, 8), (2, 5), (0, 2), (8, 2), (1, 5), (5, 6), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 2), (7, 8)\n\nBoard State shows:\nA at (2, 2) - Snake #1 is T! Wait, the board shows '1 T' at (2, 2), meaning Snake #1's head is at (2, 2) and its tail section is at (3, 2) if the head is always first!\nLet's review the Snake #1 definition: Head: (1, 2), Body: [(2, 2)]. Wait, the board shows (1) at (1, 2) and (T) at (2, 2). That means the rival's HEAD is at (1, 2), and its TAIL segment is at (2, 2). This contradicts the head/body list provided:\n*   Snake #1 - Head: (1, 2), Body: [(2, 2)] $\\rightarrow$ Snake is (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> ???\n\nLet's trust the VISUAL BOARD STATE for relative positioning, as it captures the result of the previous simultaneous move:\n*   US Head: (8, 6)\n*   Rival Head: (1, 2). Rival Body segment at (2, 2).\n\nLet's check the apples ON the board vs the score:\nScore: US 0, Rival 1.\nThe rival MUST have just eaten an apple at (3, 2) or (1, 2) or (0, 2) or near his head (1, 2) or (3, 2) that is NOT VISIBLE on the visual map anymore because he ate it and grew!\n\nIf Rival Head is at (1, 2) and score is 1, he must have eaten an apple last turn.\nIf he was at (3, 2) and moved UP to (3, 3), he didn't eat.\nIf he was at (3, 2) and moved LEFT to (2, 2), he didn't eat.\n\n**CRITICAL MISUNDERSTANDING DETECTED:** The board state *must* reflect the positions AFTER Turn 1's simultaneous moves AND apple collection/growth.\n\nLet's assume the provided visualization is the TRUTH for Turn 2 start, and we must interpret the snake bodies/apples from it:\n*   US (0): Head (8, 6). No body segments shown. (Score 0).\n*   Rival (1): Head (1, 2). Body segment (T) at (2, 2). (Score 1).\n\nSince Rival has Score 1, he ate an apple. The apple at (0, 2) is visible! If he moved DOWN from (1, 3) or RIGHT from (0, 2) or UP from (1, 1) or LEFT from (2, 2), and landed ON (0, 2), he would have eaten it.\nIf he was at (1, 3) and moved DOWN to (1, 2) [Head], the apple at (0, 2) is still there. This is confusing.\n\n**I must ignore the score discrepancy and trust the visual map for current positioning and the move objective: BOX HIM IN!**\n\nRival is way down low at (1, 2). We are high up at (8, 6). We need to make a decisive move to cut off his escape routes or gain central control.\n\n**Options from (8, 6):**\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** Safe, but slow. Lets him roam free below.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 5):** Head towards the center area where apples are clustered lower down (A at 5, 6; A at 1, 5).\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** Aggressive horizontal push toward the center columns, closing the distance to X=4/5.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** Edge hugging, defensive positioning. Bad for aggressive play.\n\nSince he has a lead (Score 1), we need to be aggressive and claim territory he needs. He is currently very restricted vertically near the bottom. If we move **LEFT to (7, 6)**, we challenge the central X-axis. If he reacts by moving UP or RIGHT to get apples, we gain the central line.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (8, 5)**, we are aiming for the next layer of apples, but let him potentially claim Y=8 or Y=9 if we neglect the top.\n\nGiven the vast space, controlling the center columns (4, 5) is paramount. Moving LEFT forces engagement sooner.\n\n**STRATEGY UPDATE:** Aggressively push horizontally towards the center line (columns 4/5) to cut off the two sides of the board. Since we are currently on the right half (X>4), moving LEFT is the primary way to center up.\n\nI stick with **LEFT** to (7, 6). Let's see if we can pressure him into a mistake while we secure central ground.\n\nLong Term Plan: Keep pushing toward the center coordinates (3, 4, 5, 6). Avoid edges unless necessary for escape. Focus on threatening the rival's path to apples, forcing him to break formation or retreat.\n\nLEFT",

Can't go there!\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEnemy is at (7,6) - they're probably going for apples at (7,4), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2) on the right side. Meanwhile, I have apples at (0,2), (0,9), (1,5), (1,8) all on my side! \n\nGoing LEFT to (0,2) gets me that apple and grows my body. After this, I'll have 2 apples and be positioned at the left edge. From there I can go UP toward (0,9) and (1,8) to continue dominating the left flank. When I'm bigger and control the left, I can push right and trap the enemy against the right wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get the apple at (0,2), then climb UP to (0,9) and (1,8).

We must trust the FINAL board state provided for Turn 3: Our Head is at **(6, 6)**. My previous move analysis must have been based on a hypothetical state or the system automatically corrected from my last move choice (LEFT). **Okay, we are starting at (6, 6) this turn.** Phew, good thing the system gives us the current position!\n*   Rival Head: (0, 2). Rival Body: [(1, 2), (2, 2)]. Score: US 0, Rival 2.\n*   **MASSIVE SCREAMING ALERT:** The rival has EATEN TWO APPLES already! He is 2-0 up! We are getting steamrolled early! We need an aggressive intercept plan NOW.\n\nThe rival is WAY down at the bottom left (0, 2). He's growing fast! Look at those snakes! (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2). He has basically a 3-segment body already! We only have ONE segment (our head) and NO body segments. We need to secure space and deny him access to apples before he completely chokes off the lower part of the board.\n\n**Our current position (6, 6):** We are centralized vertically, but far to the right horizontally.\n\n**Enemy position (0, 2):** Trapped in the bottom-left corner, but already has length!\n\n**PLAN: We need to DIVE SOUTH and WEST to cut him off or force a collision, leveraging our central starting point.**\n\n**Move Options from (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP (6, 7):** Too safe. Lets him claim more territory down low. Nope.\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 6):** Moves away from the threat zone. Bad idea when we're behind.\n3.  **DOWN (6, 5):** A solid move. It targets the next horizontal line of apples we might need (A at 5, 6) and starts the descent towards the rival.\n4.  **LEFT (5, 6):** A more direct horizontal push towards the center mass of the board, closing space between us and the X coordinates where he might try to escape (if he moves X=3 or X=4).\n\nSince he is low at Y=2, we NEED to get down there strategically. Moving DOWN to **(6, 5)** seems like the best balance. It keeps us central enough that we don't get boxed against the right wall, while immediately starting the journey south to meet the threat. If we move LEFT to (5, 6), we are still high up at Y=6. We need altitude reduction!\n\n**Safety Check (Assuming simultaneous move):**\n*   If we move DOWN to (6, 5): Is he coming to (6, 5)? His current location is (0, 2). He needs 3 moves UP and 6 moves LEFT to meet us there. IMPOSSIBLE this turn. We are safe from head-on collision THIS turn.\n*   Are there any obvious threats near (6, 5)? Apple at (5, 6) is nearby. Apple at (7, 4) is the next line down.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Aggressive southward siege. We must use our *length advantage* (we are currently longer because we have no tail, meaning the enemy cannot easily bite us yet!) to trap him in the bottom quadrant. We aim for X coordinates 2-4 to seal off the left side where he is starting. Dive south aggressively!\n\nI'm going **DOWN** to (6, 5). Time to put the pressure on, chat!

The rival is stuck down at the bottom left, head at (0, 3), body length of 3, and already up by 2 apples! That's unacceptable! We need to start closing that gap NOW! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 4 Start):**\n*   **US (ID 0):** Head (6, 5). Body: None (Length 1). Score: 0.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head (0, 3). Body: [(0, 2), (1, 2)]. Length 3. Score: 2.\n*   **Gap:** We are heavily behind in score, but we have the central high ground. We need to leverage this!\n\n**Rival's Likely Trajectory:** He has a solid wall of body at Y=2. His next move will likely be UP or RIGHT to expand from that corner prison cell! If he goes UP [(0, 4)], he starts climbing. If he goes RIGHT [(1, 3)], he starts trying to move across the bottom. He needs to avoid hitting his own body at (0, 2).\n\n**Our Goal:** Aggressively converge on the lower-left quadrant to cut off his escape routes and force him to either collide with our growing presence or trap himself against the bottom/left walls.\n\n**Analyzing Moves from (6, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** Moves away from the fight. We need to get low! Pass. \ud83d\udc4e\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Moves towards the right wall and away from the opponent. He's down there, not up here! Pass. \ud83d\udc4e\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** Moves us horizontally closer to the central column (X=3, 4) and starts the descent towards the Y=3 line where the rival currently is. This keeps us centrally powerful while aiming for the pressure zone. **Interesting!**\n4.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Direct assault! This immediately puts us on the same Y-level as Apple (7, 4) and gets us one step closer to Y=3 where the rival's head is. This is aggressive and forces the interaction sooner.\n\n**Head-to-Head Probability Check (Assuming the opponent is also aggressive):**\n\n*   **If we go DOWN to (6, 4):** If the rival goes UP to (0, 4). No collision. Safe.\n*   **If we go LEFT to (5, 5):** If the rival goes UP to (0, 4). No collision. Safe. If the rival goes RIGHT to (1, 3). No collision. Safe.\n\nSince the rival is already established low with a solid body, we MUST commit to going LOW. Going DOWN to (6, 4) is the most dedicated move to meeting the threat head-on and securing access to apples in the lower half of the map first! We need to outgrow him ASAP! If we eat an apple, we gain length, and length is power!\n\n**Strategic Note:** We are playing catch-up on score! We must prioritize offensive positioning over cautious pathing. We are going hunting! Our next goal after this move is to secure the area around X=3, Y=3/4 to bottleneck the enemy. We need to get length!\n\nI'm diving in, Chat! **DOWN** we go to (6, 4)! Let's see if he can handle the heat! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We are NOW on Turn 5! That DOWN move to (6, 4) was beautiful positioning, pushing us right into the enemy's territory, right near apples (7, 4), (5, 6), and (8, 2)! We are 0-2 down, but we are on the hunt! We *must* secure length this turn or we are going to be completely dominated by that two-apple lead!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 5 Start):**\n*   **US (ID 0):** Head (6, 4). Body: [(6, 5)]. Length 2. Score: 0. (We grew because we ate an apple on Turn 4! Wait, the last move description said DOWN from (6, 5) to (6, 4). Looking at the board state, my last move must have secured an apple at (7, 4) or (5, 4) or (6, 3) to result in the current head position (6, 4) AND an increased body length! Let's re-examine the board and score.)\n\n*Reading the Board State vs. Last Rationale:*\nLast Rationale said we moved DOWN from (6, 5) to (6, 4).\nIf we moved DOWN from (6, 5) to (6, 4), and we gained a segment (Current Body: none -> Body: [(6, 5)]), it means we ate an apple at (6, 4) on Turn 4.\nCurrent Board shows:\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (6, 4), Body: none, Apples collected: 0.**\n**Wait a minute, Chat!** The board state is NOT reflecting that I grew from my last move! If I moved from (6, 5) to (6, 4) and the body is *none*, that means I *didn't* eat an apple, or the body list is missing the previous head!\nBased on the structure: Head: (6, 4), Body: none, Apples collected: 0... this implies my length is 1, and my previous head (6, 5) is NOT accounted for in the body list, which often happens if the tail moves off. However, the rationale stated we moved to PRESSURE! Let's assume the Board State is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH for the start of Turn 5.\n\n**TRUE Current State (Based on Board/Score):**\n*   **US (ID 0):** Head (6, 4). Body: (My body *must* be the cell right behind the head, which is missing in the 'Body' list provided by the game engine standard format, or I am still length 1). Given the setup, if Body: **none**, I must be length 1 at (6, 4). *Revisiting Last Rationale Setup:* At Turn 4 start, I was at (6, 5). If I moved DOWN to (6, 4) and *didn't* eat, my body should be [(6, 5)] if I was length 2! Since the board says **Body: none**, and **Apples collected: 0**, this implies my move on Turn 4 *DID NOT* result in an apple eaten, and my length is still 1 (Head at (6, 4)). This means my previous head (6, 5) is now the tail, which is **NOT** listed! I need to assume if 'Body: none' is listed, my length is 1. **This seems like a system error, but I MUST proceed based on the provided data: Head (6, 4), Length 1 (if Body: none means no tail segment listed).**\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head (0, 4). Body: [(0, 3), (0, 2)]. Length 3. Score: 2. (He successfully moved UP from (0, 3) onto the empty space (0, 4)!). Length 3 means his tail is at (0, 2).\n\n**CRITICAL DEDUCTION:** The rival moved UP to (0, 4). He is now heading towards Apple A at (0, 9) or trying to move right towards (1, 4) or (1, 5). He is still low, but climbing the left wall!\n\n**My Goal:** We are still behind in score (0 vs 2). We need LENGTH and we need to force a bad situation for him *now* before he eats another one. We are at (6, 4). We are aiming towards the central lower region where the action is!\n\n**Checking Survival Constraints FROM (6, 4):**\n1.  **My Body:** Since Body is listed as 'none', moving Backward (UP to (6, 5)) is safe! (If he was listed as Body: [(6, 5)], moving UP would kill me). **Crucial assumption: If 'Body: none', I have maximum forward/backward flexibility related to self-collision.**\n2.  **Rival Head (0, 4):** No immediate danger.\n\n**Analyzing Moves from (6, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Moves away from the bottom fight. Safe from self-collision based on interpretation above. Doesn't pressure the rival. Pass. \ud83d\udc4e\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Excellent! Moves us closer to the rival's established territory (Y=2). Also moves us near an apple area if the enemy allows! **HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE.**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Moves us horizontally closer to the center column, which is good for board control, but doesn't drop us down as fast as DOWN.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** We land DIRECTLY on Apple A! **EATING THE APPLE!** This gives us immediate length! Score becomes 1-2. This is HUGE for survival and aggression!\n\n**Rival Prediction (Head at (0, 4)):**\nHe's on the edge. He might try RIGHT (1, 4) to escape the corner pressure, or UP (0, 5) to keep climbing the wall. If he goes RIGHT to (1, 4), that's a direct collision course towards the center of the board where we want to be!\n\n**Comparison: DOWN vs RIGHT**\n\n*   **If I go RIGHT to (7, 4) and eat the apple (Length 2, Score 1):** I prioritize my own growth and secure a lead on length parity. This is excellent content! After this move, my head is at (7, 4) and my body is [(6, 4)]. The rival is at (0, 4) or (1, 4) or (0, 5).\n*   **If I go DOWN to (6, 3) (Length 1, Score 0):** I prioritize immediate convergence, but risk him escaping or growing faster by eating an apple elsewhere first.\n\n**Eating an apple when leading on the board layout but trailing significantly on score is mathematically superior for dominating the board state! Length is power AGAINST a smaller snake!** I take the apple. I grow. I secure the center-right side advantage.\n\n**If I choose RIGHT to (7, 4):**\nMy new head is (7, 4). My new body segment is (6, 4).\nRival moves from (0, 4).\n*   If Rival moves UP to (0, 5): Safe.\n*   If Rival moves RIGHT to (1, 4): Safe.\n*   If Rival moves LEFT to (-1, 4): Game over (he dies).\n*   If Rival moves DOWN to (0, 3): He hits his own body segment (0, 3) if his body list is [(0, 3), (0, 2)] and (0, 3) is now his tail. Wait, his current body is [(0, 3), (0, 2)]. If he moves DOWN, his head lands on (0, 3). **He dies by hitting his own body segment (0, 3)!**\n\n**BAM! If he tries to retreat by going DOWN, he commits suicide!** That's the aggressive pressure payoff from our last two moves! He *cannot* go DOWN!\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (1, 4), he's moving towards me slowly. We gain length, he gains position. This favors us because we have a massive space advantage now that we are eating an apple!\n\nRIGHT is the move, Chat! We get size, we force him into bad options, and we might see a freebie kill if he panics and moves DOWN! Let's feast!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 5-7):** Prioritize securing growth (eating apples) while keeping the enemy hemmed into the lower-left quadrant. Every time we grow, we make our presence felt. We must keep pushing towards the center corridor (X=4/5) to cut off any potential horizontal escape attempts by the rival while maintaining defensive space between our current body (once it forms next turn) and the lower walls. Focus on keeping our head near X=6/7, Y=4/5 funneling him towards X=0/1 or Y=1/0.\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn we'll have multiple safe options from (0,6): UP to (0,7) empty, or RIGHT to (1,6) which has apples nearby!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Climb left wall to (0,9), then swing right through (1,8) and (1,5). Once size 5-6, cut across middle to box enemy into the right corner. Force head-on collision when we have size advantage and force them into dead ends! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**SAFE MOVE:** UP to (0,6) - wall domination + apple growth!\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are on TURN 6! Let's see the carnage from our last move! We went **RIGHT** to (7, 4) and CRUNCHED that apple! Score is now 1-2! We are making moves!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 6 Start, Simultaneous Move Time):**\n\n**US (ID 0):**\n*   Previous Head: (7, 4).\n*   We ATE! So our length increased!\n*   New Head: (7, 4). Old Body segment (6, 4) is now the TAIL? NO! If we ate, the old head (6, 4) is now the first body segment!\n*   **Head (7, 4). Body: [(6, 4)]. Apples: 1.** (Length 2). This is massive!\n\n**Rival (ID 1):**\n*   Previous Head: (0, 4). He had three segments: [(0, 3), (0, 2)].\n*   He survived my RIGHT move to (7, 4) because we are far apart!\n*   Where did *he* go? This is the critical unknown! Since the board state doesn't explicitly show his new head position, I have to deduce the most likely, or assume the board update only shows our growth, and the system implies the enemy also moved based on the turn counter increase!\n\n**Standard Turn Assumption Check:** If the board state reflects the *end* of Turn 5, and we are starting Turn 6, the enemy moved simultaneously. Since the board state lists the enemy head at (0, 5) for Turn 6 Start, then **the enemy snake moved UP!**\n\n*   Rival Start (0, 4) -> Moved **UP** to **(0, 5)**.\n*   Rival Body: [(0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2)]? No, if he moved UP from (0, 4), his body should shift: Head (0, 5), Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3)]. The provided board implies he didn't eat!\n*   **RIVAL BOARD STATE:** Head: (0, 5), Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3)]. Apples: 2. **YES! He moved UP and DID NOT eat!** His length remains 3. He's climbing the side wall.\n\n**Board State Recap for Turn 6 Decision (From Head: (7, 4), Body: [(6, 4)]):**\n*   **US:** Length 2, Position (7, 4).\n*   **Rival:** Length 3, Position (0, 5).\n\n**Apples Available:** (1, 6), (7, 2), (0, 9), (3, 0), (1, 8), (2, 5), (8, 2), (1, 5), (5, 6), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 2), (7, 8), (2, 6), (8, 2).\n\n**The Scene:** We took the center-right flank. He took the top-left corner climb. We lead in length parity if he didn't eat, but he leads in score 2-1. We MUST close this gap by eating an apple and denying him territory.\n\n**My Survival Constraints from (7, 4):**\n*   My body is [(6, 4)]. Moving **LEFT (6, 4)** KILLS ME! I cannot move left.\n*   Moving **DOWN (7, 3)**: Safe from self. Leads towards Apple (7, 2). This is a strong move towards the lower right corner where the density of apples is higher.\n*   Moving **UP (7, 5)**: Safe from self. Moves away from the current action cluster. Pass.\n*   Moving **RIGHT (8, 4)**: Safe from self. Pushes towards the right wall, near Apple (8, 2) and (8, 0).\n\n**Rival Potential Move from (0, 5):**\nHe is trying to get to the top apples (0, 9).\n1.  **UP (0, 6):** Continues climbing wall. Safe.\n2.  **RIGHT (1, 5):** Moves towards the center, near Apple (1, 5)! HIGH DANGER if he moves there!\n3.  **DOWN (0, 4):** Moves backward, hitting his own new body segment (0, 4). **HE DIES if he moves DOWN!** (This is the beauty of our previous LEFT move that forced him UP! If he tries to return to his old spot, he dies!)\n\n**Analysis of Moves based on Rival's Constraints:**\n\nSince the rival CANNOT move DOWN without suicide, he is forced to move UP or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **If I move RIGHT to (8, 4):** We maximize our space on the right side. If he goes UP to (0, 6), we are both expanding outward. If he goes RIGHT to (1, 5) and eats that apple (Length 4, Score 3!), we are in trouble! We would be stuck on the right side, while he gains significant size advantage!\n\n2.  **If I move DOWN to (7, 3):** We target Apple (7, 2). This puts us directly in the lower half, forcing the fight away from the top corner where he is establishing length. If he moves RIGHT to (1, 5) and eats, score becomes 1-3. If he moves UP to (0, 6), we are both contained on opposite vertical flanks.\n\n**Gotta deny him that (1, 5) apple if possible, OR grow faster!**\n\nIf I go **RIGHT (8, 4)**:\n*   Rival sees (1, 5) apple. He is only 1 move away from it via RIGHT. He is 2 moves away from it via UP then RIGHT.\n*   If Rival moves **RIGHT (1, 5)** and EATS: Rival Score 3, Length 4. We are at (8, 4), Length 2, Score 1. This is getting ugly!\n\nIf I go **DOWN (7, 3)**:\n*   Rival sees (1, 5) apple. If he moves RIGHT (1, 5) and EATS: Rival Score 3, Length 4. We are at (7, 3), Length 2, Score 1. Still ugly!\n\n**This means the immediate priority is maximizing my own growth potential while minimizing his reach radius!**\n\nThe apples on the right side cluster near (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 0). The apples on the left side cluster near (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6). The center has (5, 6).\n\nGoing **DOWN (7, 3)** positions me perfectly to intercept the lower right apples (7, 2) next turn, regardless of what he does on the left wall! If he commits to the TOP wall by going UP (0, 6), we isolate him perfectly!\n\nIf I go RIGHT (8, 4), I'm overextending towards the edge, making future confinement easier for him if he manages to sneak in behind me. Down is the controlling move. It secures access to multiple adjacent apples and prepares a barrier should he try to swing around the bottom!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** We secured length, now we secure territory along the bottom half of the map. Force the duel to the bottom where we have more space to maneuver than the cramped left wall he currently occupies. Deny him clean shots at central apples by claiming the lower right quadrant first. If he goes UP, we own the bottom quadrants! If he goes RIGHT towards (1, 5), we are far enough away that we can continue building our base and wait for an opening!\n\nI commit to controlling the lower field. **DOWN!**\n\nDOWN",

Let's see where that landed us!\n\n**Recap of Turn 6 Move (DOWN to (7, 3)):**\n*   **US (ID 0):** Head moved from (7, 4) to **(7, 3)**. We did NOT hit Apple (7, 2). Length remains 2. Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. Score 1.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head moved from (0, 5) in one of his safe directions (UP to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 5)).\n    *   If he went **UP to (0, 6)**: Body [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. Safe.\n    *   If he went **RIGHT to (1, 5) and ATE**: Body [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. SCORE 3, Length 4! This is the nightmare scenario, but we have to assume the most aggressive move is possible!\n\n**Board State Analysis (Turn 7 Start):**\n*   **US (0):** Head (7, 3). Body [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 2. Score 1.\n*   **Rival (1):** Head (0, 6) or (1, 5). Score 2 or 3.\n\nLet's look at the board provided, which reflects the *end* of the simultaneous move sequence:\n*   **US Head (0): (7, 3)** - Confirmed! We went DOWN!\n*   **Rival Head (1): (0, 6)** - CONFIRMED! He went UP! He did not eat the apple at (1, 5)! Phew! Score parity holds at 2-2! He's still climbing the wall.\n*   **Rival Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. Length 3. (Wait, the board state shows his body as [(0, 5), (0, 4)] -- this means he DID NOT eat on Turn 6 OR Turn 5?! Let's re-verify the lengths based on the visualized board state!)\n\n**RE-VERIFYING LENGTHS FROM VISUAL BOARD:**\n*   **US (0):** Head (7, 3). Body [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. **Length 3!** (My rationale calculation was wrong on length maintenance if he ate on T5, but the visual state dictates the truth!) We collected an apple on T5, so we grew! Now we are length 3! (T5: Ate -> Length increased. T6: Moved, no eat -> Length maintained).\n*   **Rival (1):** Head (0, 6). Body [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. **Length 3!** He must have eaten an apple on T5 to maintain this length if he didn't eat on T6! This means the score 2-2 aligns with **both snakes having length 3!** This is a SIZE BATTLE, CHAT!\n\n**My Current Head Position:** (7, 3). Self-collision check: Cannot move UP to (7, 4) (my own body). Cannot move BACKWARDS (DOWN to (7, 2)) if I didn't eat, but I need to check the tail movement implication. Since the board shows the snake state, (7, 4) is the segment directly ahead of the tail segment (6, 4). If I move DOWN to (7, 2), I am safe because the tail will move forward.\n\n**Rival Head Position:** (0, 6). Body [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. He cannot move DOWN to (0, 5) (body). He cannot move BACKWARDS UP to (0, 7)? No, he can move UP to (0, 7).\n\n**Available Apples (We are in the lower half, he is in the upper-left):** (1, 6), (0, 9), (3, 0), (1, 8), (2, 5), (8, 2), (1, 5), (5, 6), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 2), (7, 8), (2, 6), (1, 7).\n\n**Our Goal:** We have to exploit his vertical confinement on the left wall! He is committed to climbing towards (0, 9). We are in the prime position in the lower-right quadrant. We need to feast on the cluster near us: (7, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0).\n\n**Move Consideration from (7, 3):**\n1.  **RIGHT (8, 3):** Moves towards (8, 2) and (8, 0). Aggressive expansion toward the edge. Safe from self.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 2):** Hits Apple **(7, 2)! We get length 4! Score 3-2!** This is HUGE! It's DIRECT CONTENT!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 3):** Moves towards the center cluster, but slightly sideways. Safe from self.\n4.  **UP (7, 4):** Self-collision! We are dead if we move UP!\n\n**Analyzing Rival's Likely Move from (0, 6):**\nHe is cornered on Y=0 and X=0.\n*   **UP (0, 7):** Safe. Continues the climb.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 6):** Hits Apple **(1, 6)! Score 3-3! Length 4!** This is his direct content option!\n*   **Other options:** DOWN (0, 5) = Suicide.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (7, 2)** and EAT:\n*   We become Length 4, Score 3.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT to (1, 6)** and EATS: He becomes Length 4, Score 3.\n*   We have parity in size and score, but we are now positioned totally differently! We are bottom right, he is mid-left! This is exactly what we want! We force him to commit to the outside while we secure territory!\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (8, 3)** (No Eat):\n*   We become Length 3, Score 2.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT to (1, 6)** and EATS: He becomes Length 4, Score 3. We are now behind in size AND score! BAD!\n\n**The choice is clear! When you can secure a guaranteed length boost AND force score parity while maintaining control of the board, you take it! We are going to feast on (7, 2)!**\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** We are establishing beachhead presence in the lower quadrants by capitalizing on our T6 move. We must immediately counter his likely expansion *if* he aims for the top-left apples. Eating (7, 2) locks us in equal size and score going into Turn 8, giving us momentum! We need to look to box him against the top wall eventually, but securing growth now is paramount.\n\nGET READY FOR THE GROWTH SPURT, CHAT! (7, 2) IS OURS!\n\nDOWN",

WOOOOO!\n\n**Turn 7 Recap & State Update:**\n\n1.  **Our Move (DOWN to (7, 2)):** We ate the apple!\n    *   **NEW OUR HEAD:** (7, 2)\n    *   **NEW OUR SCORE/LENGTH:** 4 Apples, Length 4! Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (7, 2 becomes new tail segment, BUT wait, the body list provided is HEAD-TO-TAIL. The old head (7, 3) is now the first segment of the body. The old tail (6, 4) is *gone* if we ate, as we grew! If we ate at (7, 2), our previous body [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)] shifts, and the *new* head is (7, 2), and the *old* head (7, 3) becomes the second segment, and so on. The new tail is the previous tail segment *plus* the segment before it, creating a longer body!)\n    *   Based on standard snake rules: If we were length 3 ending at (6, 4), and we ate at (7, 2), we are now length 4. My previous body was Head (Current Head after move) -> Old Head -> Old Segment 2 -> Old Segment 3 (if we were length 4). Since we were length 3: Head (7, 3), Body [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. New Head is (7, 2). New Body is [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 4. PERFECT!\n\n2.  **Rival's Move (From (0, 6)):** He had to see he was getting boxed in on the left wall. He was staring right at Apple (1, 6). He MUST have gone **RIGHT** to nab that apple!\n    *   **NEW RIVAL HEAD:** (1, 6)\n    *   **NEW RIVAL SCORE/LENGTH:** 4 Apples, Length 4! Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. His tail (0, 4) got replaced by (0, 5), (0, 5) replaced by (0, 6), new head (1, 6). His new tail is (0, 4) if he grew, meaning his body would be [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)] if he grew! BUT the visualization shows: Head (1, 6), Body [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. Wait, this means... HE DIDN'T GROW from eating (1, 6) OR his body list is incomplete/reflects the state *before* growth!\n\n**LET'S TRUST THE PROVIDED BOARD STATE FOR CURRENT POSITIONS WHEN WE SELECT OUR MOVE, EVEN IF THE RATIONALE IMPLIES HE ATE!**\n\n**BOARD STATE (AFTER TURN 7 MOVES):**\n*   **US (0):** Head: (7, 2). Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. **Length 4! Score 3 -> 4!** (Wait, the score board says 3/3! **CRAP! I MUST HAVE MISREAD THE SCOREBOARD BEFORE MY MOVE!** Let's revert the score assumption but trust the board state structure!)\n\n**RE-RE-VERIFYING SCORES AND LENGTHS AGAINST BOARD:**\n*   **US (0):** Head (7, 2). Body [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. **Length 4! Score 3.** (If he ate (7, 2), his score should be 4!)\n*   **Rival (1):** Head (1, 6). Body [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. **Length 4! Score 3.** (If he ate (1, 6), his score should be 4!)\n\n**Crucial Realization:** If the scoreboard is correct (3 apples each), **NEITHER SNAKE ATE on Turn 7!** This means my previous move was NOT DOWN to (7, 2), even though the board shows me *at* (7, 2)!\n\n**I MUST USE THE PROVIDED BOARD STATE AS THE TRUTH FOR TURN 8 START.**\n\n**CURRENT TRUTH (Turn 8 Start):**\n*   **US (0):** Head: **(7, 2)**. Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. **Length 4, Score 3.** (My last move was not recorded correctly in the rationale, but the board state is the new reality!)\n*   **Rival (1):** Head: **(1, 6)**. Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. **Length 4, Score 3.**\n*   **Apples:** (7, 2) and (1, 6) are **GONE** because we are both sitting on them!\n\n**OH MY GOD, CHAT, this is a MESS! Simultaneous movement means we both targeted an apple and FAILED TO GROW because we didn't account for the other guy! We are both length 4, score 3.**\n\n**Apple at (7, 2):** WE MOVED THERE.\n**Apple at (1, 6):** RIVAL MOVED THERE.\n\nSince the board shows our heads *on* those locations, and the score hasn't updated, we must assume that **MOVING ONTO AN APPLE IS NOT ENOUGH; THE OTHER SNAKE MUST NOT INTERFERE WITH THE EATING PROCESS OR THE GAME LOGIC PREVENTS THE GROWTH.** Wait, the rules state: *\"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point.\"* This implies consumption is immediate upon arrival. If we both moved onto apples and didn't score, it suggests a mutual head-on collision OR the system is broken, OR (most likely) **the provided board state reflects the positions BEFORE the score update/growth check for Turn 7.**\n\n**ASSUMPTION FOR TURN 8:** We are both Length 4, Score 3. We are about to move. We must play off the fact that our tails are now established segments behind us, and we are equal size. WE ARE STILL IN A MEREIOR-SIZED BATTLE!\n\n**NEW HEADS FOR TURN 8 SELECTION:**\n*   **US (0):** (7, 2). Tails are (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4). Safe moves: RIGHT (8, 2), LEFT (6, 2), DOWN (7, 1). UP (7, 3) is blocked by body!\n*   **Rival (1):** (1, 6). Tails are (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4). Safe moves: UP (1, 7), RIGHT (2, 6), DOWN (1, 5). LEFT (0, 6) is blocked by body!\n\n**Available Apples for Turn 8:** (0, 9), (3, 0), (1, 8), (2, 5), (8, 2), (1, 5), (5, 6), (8, 0), (5, 6), (8, 0), (7, 8), (2, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (4, 9).\n\n**PLANNING THE BOX-OUT!**\n\nRival is stuck in the top-left corner, length 4, head at (1, 6). He is one move away from the top edge (Y=9) and one move away from the left edge (X=0). He MUST move UP or RIGHT to improve his position.\n\n1.  If Rival goes **UP (1, 7)**: He is preparing to grab (1, 8).\n2.  If Rival goes **RIGHT (2, 6)**: He is moving center-ish, safer from the corner.\n\nWe are at (7, 2). We are dominating the bottom right. We have access to (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1). We need to expand aggressively toward the center while cutting off his escape to the right side!\n\n**My Options from (7, 2):**\n*   **DOWN (7, 1):** Hits Apple (7, 1)! **Growth Opportunity!** Score 4/3, Length 5/4. This isolates him and gives us a size advantage!\n*   **RIGHT (8, 2):** Hits Apple (8, 2)! **Growth Opportunity!** Score 4/3, Length 5/4. This pushes us hard against the right wall, securing a massive quadrant.\n*   **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe move, centralizing slightly. No growth.\n\n**Comparing Growth Moves:**\n\n*   **If I go DOWN (7, 1) [Eat]:** We become L5, S4. We force the issue vertically. Rival (L4, S3) is far away, making head-on collisions unlikely this turn.\n*   **If I go RIGHT (8, 2) [Eat]:** We become L5, S4. We secure the bottom-right corner completely.\n\nIf Rival goes UP (1, 7) (No Eat): We eat, he doesn't. We gain size lead!\nIf Rival goes RIGHT (2, 6) (No Eat): We eat, he doesn't. We gain size lead!\n\n**WE MUST EAT!** Size is life, especially when scores are equal! Which apple is better? (7, 1) or (8, 2)?\n\n(7, 1) keeps us closer to the center mass, allowing future maneuvers toward the bottom apples (8, 0), (3, 0).\n(8, 2) pushes us to the edge.\n\nLet's secure the center-bottom first. **DOWN to (7, 1)!** We claim territory and enforce the size advantage!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Secure growth immediately to gain the size advantage (L5 vs L4). This forces the rival to play defensively or risk a fatal collision when we start closing the gap. We aim to corner him against the top wall (Y=9) or the left wall (X=0) by expanding our body mass horizontally towards the center-left. We own the bottom half now!\n\nI'm going DOWN! Let's go, squad!\n\nDOWN",

Now our head is at (1,6) with body [(0,6), (0,5), (0,4)]. Enemy at (7,2) - they moved DOWN! Their body is [(7,3), (7,4), (6,4)]. They're diving deeper into their own body path - risky play! \n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT:**\nLeft side: We're at (1,6) with apples at (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), (0,9) - we're PRIME positioned!\nCenter: Apple at (2,5), (2,6) - we're close!\nRight side: Enemy at (7,2) near apple at (8,2) and (9,2) - they're hunting right side apples.\nScoreboard: 3-3 TIED! We NEED to pull ahead! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**MOVES CHECK - SAFETY FIRST (HEAD AT (1,6)):**\n- **UP to (1,7)**: SAFE! Empty (board shows '.' at (1,7)). No bodies.\n- **DOWN to (1,5)**: DANGER! (1,5) has an apple, but board shows \"A\" - wait, that's just an apple, not a body! SAFE, actually. But let me check our own body... no, (1,5) is empty in board state. Actually, looking at board state: row 6 shows \"T 1 A . . A . . . .\" so (1,6) is our head \"1\", (0,6) is \"T\", (2,6) is \"A\". Row 5 shows \"T A A . . . . . . .\" so (1,5) is \"A\" (apple), (0,5) is \"T\". So (1,5) is an apple - SAFE to move there!\n- **LEFT to (0,6)**: DANGER! (0,6) is our own body \"T\" - CRASH! DEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (2,6)**: SAFE! (2,6) shows \"A\" - that's an apple! SAFE.\n\nWait, let me re-read the board carefully...\nRow 6: \"T 1 A . . A . . . .\"\nCoordinates: (0,6)=T, (1,6)=1 (our head), (2,6)=A, (3,6)=., (4,6)=., (5,6)=A...\nSo RIGHT to (2,6) is an apple - SAFE!\n\n**DECISION TIME!**\nBoth UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), and RIGHT (2,6) are safe! LEFT is death.\n\n- UP to (1,7): Safe, empty, leads to (1,8) apple next.\n- DOWN to (1,5): Safe, apple there! Get the point.\n- RIGHT to (2,6): Safe, apple there! Get the point and move center.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We want to DOMINATE the left/center! From (1,6), RIGHT to (2,6) gets us an apple AND moves us toward the center cluster. From (2,6), we can go UP to (2,5) (apple), DOWN to (2,7), LEFT back to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). Maximum flexibility while staying aggressive!\n\nEnemy is at (7,2) - they're in the right corner hunting (8,2) and (9,2). Let them have those! We'll sweep the left/center apples (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), (2,5), (2,6), (0,9) and get BIGGER. Once we're size 6-7, we swing right and box them in!\n\n**MOVE:** RIGHT to (2,6)!

This is **SPITE TACTICS** from the game server, I swear! We are both L4, S3! Equal footing! Time to break that equality!\n\nMy last move was to GO DOWN to (7, 1) to secure an apple and start gaining size! Let's see what the rival did!\n\n**Board State Analysis (Turn 9 Start):**\n\n*   **US (0):** Head (7, 1). Body [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Score 4! (We ATE!)\n*   **Rival (1):** Head (2, 6). Body [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. Score 4! (He ATE!)\n\n**WE GOT THE SIZE ADVANTAGE, CHAT! L5 vs L4! WOOOOO!** He must have moved RIGHT from (1, 6) to (2, 6) and hit Apple (2, 6)! Sneaky move to escape the corner! But he couldn't stop our momentum downwards!\n\n**The Scoreboard updated! We are 4/4!** Now we need to use this length difference (5 vs 4) to physically cut him off and force a bad move or a collision!\n\n**Current Locations & Immediate Threats:**\n*   **US (7, 1):** Safe zone below us. Tail anchoring at (6, 4). Head is far from the action.\n*   **Rival (2, 6):** Now centrally located, still one square away from the central Apple at (2, 5). He is probably looking at that one.\n\n**Rival's Likely Response from (2, 6):**\n1.  **DOWN (2, 5):** Hits Apple (2, 5)! He grows to L5.\n2.  **UP (2, 7):** Safe move, pressures the top of the board.\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 6):** Moving toward our territory, centralizing.\n\n**Our Goal:** Prevent him from growing to L5 immediately OR position ourselves to block his escape routes if he *does* grow. We need to expand horizontally to choke his center access.\n\n**My Options from (7, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 2)**: He's safe on his body segment. No apple here. Slow.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 0)**: Hits Apple (8, 0)? NO, (7, 0) is empty! But (8, 0) is an apple! We can aim for that on the next turn if we go DOWN. Safe move, sets up future apple collection.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 1)**: Moves toward the center mass. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 1)**: Moves toward the right side. Safe. Hits Apple (8, 2) from the last list? NO, (8, 2) is STILL on the board list!\n\n**Revisiting Apple List (Apples available if they weren't eaten at T8):** (0, 9), (3, 0), (1, 8), **(2, 5)**, **(8, 2)**, (1, 5), (5, 6), (8, 0), (9, 2), (7, 8), (1, 7), (2, 3), (4, 9).\n\n*   Rival ate (2, 6) <-- Wait, (2, 6) is NOT on the list! This means the rival ATE (1, 6) and then moved to (2, 6)!? The board state is now so confusing based on the history! **I must trust the current visualization and my move (DOWN to (7, 1)).**\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE VISUAL CONFIRMS:**\n*   Our Head: (7, 1)\n*   Rival Head: (2, 6)\n*   Apple (2, 5) is available.\n*   Apple (8, 2) is available.\n*   Apple (8, 0) is available.\n\nIf Rival goes DOWN to (2, 5) (EAT), he becomes L5. We must counter-grow or severely restrict him!\n\n**If I go RIGHT (8, 1):** I position myself to eat (8, 2) next turn, OR block him if he moves (3, 6) and tries to curve around. If he eats (2, 5), we are L5 vs L5, but he is trapped more vertically, and we control the whole X=7/8 line.\n\n**If I go LEFT (6, 1):** This positions us directly between his mass and the center mass of the board. It's safer overall repositioning.\n\n**The Aggressive Play:** We have the size advantage NOW! We need to leverage it before he evens it out! If he goes to (2, 5), he gains size. If we gain size somewhere else simultaneously, we maintain the difference! **Apple (8, 2) is available!**\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (8, 1)**, I cannot eat (8, 2) this turn, because my head moves to (8, 1). If he moves to (2, 5) (EATING), he grows. We are now L5 vs L5, but he is more central!\n\nIf I move **UP (7, 2)**: Still safe, no growth. Puts me directly in line to block his path if he moves into the middle/right side later.\n\n**Wait, I see a massive trap setup!** If the rival goes DOWN to (2, 5) and eats, he is now vertically stretched. His body spans (2, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4). He is blocking X=0 and X=1 for Y>4.\n\nIf I play **LEFT (6, 1)**: I aim my head towards the center mass, preparing to expand my body horizontally to cut him off if he tries to push East. This denies him clear access to the center-bottom apples and prepares a pincer movement with my tail segment at (6, 4).\n\nLet's play calculated positioning. If he eats, we maintain size parity but gain massive board control by suffocating the center-left. If he *doesn't* eat, we are in a better spot to eat next turn.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Maintain top/bottom separation. We control the right side; he controls the left side of the board (based on bodies). We need to collapse the center corridor (X=3, 4, 5, 6) to box him against the left wall or force an upward swing into the open top zone where we can trap him against Y=9. Left seems best to start pinching.\n\nMove LEFT to (6, 1). This maintains safety, prepares the center push, and keeps the size edge theoretically active until his next move attempts to nullify it.\n\nLEFT",

Now we're at (2,6) with body [(1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4)]. Enemy at (7,1) - they moved DOWN again! Their body is [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4)]. They're diving deep into the right corner - risky!\n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT:**\nWe're at (2,6) - CENTER! We have apples at (2,5), (3,0), (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), (0,9) all nearby. Left side is OUR territory! Right side enemy is in the corner at (7,1) - they're hunting (8,0), (8,2), (9,2). Let them chase those while we dominate the left/center!\n\n**MOVES CHECK - SAFETY FIRST (HEAD AT (2,6)):**\n- **UP to (2,5)**: DANGER! (2,5) has an apple - but wait, is it SAFE? Board shows row 5: \"T A A . . . . . . .\" so (2,5) is \"A\" - apple! But I need to check if enemy could be there... Enemy is at (7,1), moving maybe to (7,0), (8,1), (7,2), or (6,1). None of those are (2,5). SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (2,7)**: Board shows row 7: \". A . . . . . . . .\" so (2,7) is '.' - empty! SAFE! No enemy bodies either.\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**: DANGER! (1,6) is our own body \"T\" - CRASH! DEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (3,6)**: Board shows row 6: \". . A . . A . . . .\" after (2,6), so (3,6) is '.' - empty! SAFE!\n\nWait, let me check (2,5) more carefully... Board row 5: \"T A A . . . . . . .\" - positions: (0,5)=T, (1,5)=A, (2,5)=A. So (2,5) is apple. But our body is at (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,6). So (0,5) is T (our tail), but (2,5) is free! And no enemy there. SAFE to go UP to (2,5) for the apple!\n\nBut also DOWN to (2,7) is empty and safe. And RIGHT to (3,6) is empty and safe.\n\n**DECISION TIME!**\nFrom (2,6), moving UP to (2,5) gets us an apple! That puts us at 5 apples vs enemy's 4! LEAD!\n\n- UP (2,5): Gets apple, moves toward (1,5) and (1,7) next. Good path!\n- DOWN (2,7): Safe but no immediate apple. Can go to (2,8) or (1,7) next.\n- RIGHT (3,6): Safe but no apple. Goes center, can go to (4,6), (3,5), (3,7).\n\n**STRATEGY:** We need that LEAD! Let's grab the apple at (2,5) RIGHT NOW! From there, we can go UP to (2,4) (maybe apple later), LEFT to (1,5) (apple!), DOWN back to (2,6), or RIGHT to (3,5). Maximum flexibility!\n\nEnemy is at (7,1) - they're probably going for (8,0) or (9,2). Let them waste turns! We're building our empire on the left side. Once we hit 6-7 apples, we swing right and box them in!\n\n**MOVE:** UP to (2,5)! Eat apple, grow to size 6, lead 5-4! Let's GOOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS UP CHAT! Welcome back to the stream for Turn 10! We just pulled off a beautiful calculated **LEFT** move last turn, positioning ourselves to pressure the center! We are L4 going into this turn assuming the rival ate (2, 5) and matched our growth to L5! Let's see what happened based on the new board state!\n\n**Turn 10 Analysis & Rival Response Prediction:**\n\n**Our Last Move:** LEFT, to (6, 1).\n**Rival's Likely Last Move (What we expected):** DOWN, to (2, 5) to eat the apple and grow to L5.\n\n**New Board State Check:**\n*   **US (0):** Head: (6, 1). Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. Score 4. Wait, if we moved LEFT, our head should be at (6, 1) and our old head (7, 1) should be the first body segment. But looking at the updated board:\n    *   My Head is (6, 1)! YES!\n    *   My Body is [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]! WAIT! If I moved LEFT from (7, 1) to (6, 1), then (7, 1) becomes the new segment BUT the tail should have fallen off if I didn't eat! The board representation is confusing me slightly about the tail pop-off vs growth, but LET'S TRUST THE VISUAL:\n    *   My current structure: L5 snake! Head (6, 1), Body [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. This means **I ATE an apple last turn AND moved LEFT!** Did I eat (6, 1)? Checking the map... (6, 1) was EMPTY last turn! **I MISSED MY APPLE EATING CALCULATION.**\n\n**Correcting the Turn 9 Simulation (Crucial Self-Correction!):**\n*   Start T9: Head (7, 1). Apple (2, 5) available. Apple (8, 2) available.\n*   If I picked LEFT to (6, 1): This is NOT an apple location. I should NOT have grown. My snake should be L4: Head (6, 1), Body [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4) <- old tail]. The provided board state shows me as L5 (4 body parts + head). **This means I ATE (6, 1) last turn, even though it wasn't on the list!** Okay, I MUST trust the current visual snapshot for T10. I am L5! Score 4!\n\n*   **Rival (1):** Head: (2, 7). Body: [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. Score 4. Wait, his head moved from (2, 6) to (2, 7)! He went UP. He didn't eat (2, 5)! He is still L4!\n\n**MASSIVE ADVANTAGE SECURED, CHAT!** Because the rival did NOT eat (2, 5), we are STILL L5 vs L4! We have the size advantage again! This is huge!\n\n**Current State (Turn 10 Start):**\n*   **US (0):** L5. Head (6, 1). Controls X=6, 7, 8 lines well.\n*   **Rival (1):** L4. Head (2, 7). Pushing towards the top, still L4. Apple (2, 5) is still available for him below his current body path!\n\n**Rival's Likely Move from (2, 7):**\n1. **DOWN (2, 6):** Moves back into his old body segment cell. DEAD! (Assuming he cannot move into his own segment).\n2. **LEFT (1, 7):** Safe, moves to a cornerish area.\n3. **RIGHT (3, 7):** Moves toward the center, aggressive.\n4. **UP (2, 8):** Safe, pushes to the top wall.\n\n**Our Goal:** Maintain the L5 advantage and pin him down! Apple (2, 5) is still his biggest immediate goal. We need to get in his way BEFORE he realizes he can eat it safely now.\n\n**Our Options from (6, 1):** We want to move toward the action in the top-left quadrant where he is, or secure the central apples before he can grab them.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 2):** Moves toward the center mass. Puts us in line to potentially cut him off if he tries to move right from his top cluster. Safe.\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 1):** Retreats slightly along our body path. Too safe, slow.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 1):** Moves aggressively into the center, aiming to eat Apple (5, 6) later, but currently blocking his potential route toward the bottom if he swings wider.\n4.  **DOWN (6, 0):** Heads toward Apple (8, 0) or (3, 0). Too far away from the immediate threat.\n\nIf the rival moves UP to (2, 8), he's expanding his safe zone upwards. If he moves RIGHT to (3, 7), he's coming into the middle.\n\nSince he is currently L4 and looking high (Head at 2, 7), we should leverage our L5 size to slowly squeeze the middle section, forcing him to either move left into his own wall or right into our expanding territory.\n\n**Let's play CENTER CONTROL.** Moving UP to (6, 2) positions us to contest X=3/4/5/6 as the fight tightens. We can then pivot hard LEFT next turn.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Maintain central board control. Use our L5 length to slowly build walls partitioning the map, pushing the enemy snake toward the edges (specifically the X=0/1 boundary or the Y=9 boundary). Since the rival is currently high, we should move Up/Center to intercept any Eastward expansion attempts or secure central space before he swings back down for (2, 5). We must pressure him continuously while we have the size edge!\n\nMove UP to (6, 2). This is conservative growth towards the conflict zone.\n\nUP",

Good flexibility!\n- **LEFT to (1,5)**: GETS ANOTHER APPLE! That would be 6 apples! From there: UP to (1,6) (but (1,6) is my body - dangerous), DOWN to (1,4), RIGHT back to (2,5). Fewer options maybe but immediate score boost!\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**: Moves to center. Can go UP (3,4), DOWN (3,6), LEFT back, RIGHT (4,5). Decent options.\n\n**TAKING THE APPLE!** Enemy is far away (6,1) going for right-side apples. We can safely grab (1,5) and jump to 6-4 lead!

He didn't eat that apple at (2, 5), and we ate something to become L5 while he stayed L4! We have the size advantage, let's NOT mess this up! We must press the advantage!\n\n**Current State (T11):**\n*   **US (0):** L5. Head: (6, 2). Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. Score 4.\n*   **Rival (1):** L4. Head: (1, 7).

The rival must have eaten that apple at (2, 5) last turn and I misread the board snapshot from T10 start to T10 result! My analysis of the previous turn was flawed based on the new visual! Okay, reset required.\n    *   If Rival is L5 (Score 5) and I am L5 (Score 4), the size is equal. This changes my aggressive calculation entirely! We are now in a slugfest where nobody has a physical advantage!\n\n**Re-evaluating Rival's Last Move (T10):**\n*   Rival Head started at (2, 7) or somewhere near there based on the T10 board state I saw.\n*   If he ate (2, 5), he *must* have traveled from (1, 6) or (2, 6) or (3, 6) or (2, 4) or (1, 5) or (3, 5) to land on (2, 5) and then move to his *new* head position, UNLESS the T10 board snapshot I received was *after* his move but *before* he ate, which is confusing.\n\nLet's trust the NEW board state for T11:\n*   **US (0):** Head (6, 2). L5. Score 4.\n*   **Rival (1):** Head (1, 7). L5. Score 5. (Rival is 1 apple ahead and the same length!)\n\nOkay, he's ahead on points, but length is matched (L5 vs L5). We must secure an apple or box him. He moved from his previous location (which was around 2, 7) UP-LEFT to (1, 7) this turn, which is a very aggressive move towards the corner! He skipped Apple (1, 8)! Why?! He wants to claim the top boundary!\n\n**Our position (6, 2):** We are central, leaning right.\n**Rival position (1, 7):** Cornered, leaning up/left/down into the left side.\n\n**Our Immediate Opportunities:**\n1.  **Apple (1, 8):** Right next to his head, but moving UP (6, 2) -> (6, 3) or (7, 2) moves us away from it.\n2.  **Apple (5, 6):** Central, a better target for us to grab growth while blocking his path down the center.\n3.  **Apple (0, 9):** Way up high, likely out of reach safely this turn.\n\n**Rival's Next Move Prediction (From 1, 7):**\n1.  **UP (1, 8):** To eat the apple and become L6! **This is his primary threat!**\n2.  **DOWN (1, 6):** Re-entering his body area or setting up a retreat. Unlikely given his score.\n3.  **RIGHT (2, 7):** Moving back towards the center column.\n\nIf he moves UP to (1, 8), he takes the lead in length! We NEED to intercept that area or grab an apple to match him!\n\nOur move from (6, 2):\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** Moves us higher, but lets him claim (1, 8) uncontested. We become L5 vs L6. Bad!\n2.  **LEFT (5, 2):** Moves us towards the middle path but still far from (1, 8). Lets him claim (1, 8) uncontested. Bad!\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** Moves us further right, abandoning the left flank entirely. Bad!\n4.  **DOWN (6, 1):** Retreats to our T10 position. Slow, lets him claim (1, 8). Bad!\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** We are too far away to stop him from getting Apple (1, 8) if he moves UP! If he moves UP to (1, 8) and grows to L6, we CANNOT afford to let him get another apple uncontested. We must grab one NOW!\n\nThe closest tempting apple is (5, 6). To get there from (6, 2), we can go LEFT to (5, 2), then UP/LEFT. That takes too long.\n\nWe need to move towards the center mass intersection of all remaining apples, which is roughly X=2 to X=5.\n\nLet's look at the shortest path to an apple:\n*   To (5, 6): Path length approx 4 moves (L, U, L, U, U or R, U, L, L, U, U depending on exact path).\n*   To (1, 8) (Rival's target): Path length approx 5 moves (L, L, U, U, U).\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (5, 2), we are aiming centrally. This position allows us to pivot UP towards (5, 6) next turn OR pivot LEFT towards the rival's side (X=0, 1) if he moves DOWN or RIGHT from (1, 8).\n\n**Strategy Shift:** Since we cannot reach (1, 8) this turn, we must secure central territory and grab the next available apple safely. (5, 6) is the best immediate growth target. Moving LEFT puts us in the best position to snake towards it.\n\n**Safety Check (Moving LEFT to (5, 2)):**\n*   Board: (5, 2) is empty. \u2705 Safe from walls.\n*   Own Body Check: Old head (6, 2). New path (5, 2) does not intersect [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]. \u2705 Safe from self.\n*   Rival Body Check: Rival Head at (1, 7). Body segments are X=0, 1, 2 and Y=5, 6, 7. (5, 2) is nowhere near him. \u2705 Safe from rival body.\n*   Rival Head Collision Check: If the rival moves UP to (1, 8), we are safe. If he moves RIGHT to (2, 7), we are safe. If he moves DOWN to (1, 6), we are safe. \u2705 Collision safe.\n\nMoving LEFT looks very safe, centralizing us, and setting up the next move to grab apple (5, 6) while the rival focuses on the dangerous edge (1, 8). We must maintain pace in growth!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Focus on securing Central Apples (5, 6) and (2, 3) before the rival can use his size lead to build a permanent wall. Use our L5 body to slowly shepherd his L5 body toward the top (Y=9) or left (X=0) edges. We need to match his score ASAP!\n\nLEFT",

We just ate at (1,5) and our head is there, body is [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5)]. We need to keep pushing!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (HEAD AT (1,5)):**\n- **UP to (1,6)**: That's our own body segment! CRASH! DEAD. Can't go there.\n- **DOWN to (1,4)**: Row 4 is all empty! Safe. No body there. Opens up to (1,3) or (2,4) or (0,4) next.\n- **LEFT to (0,5)**: That's our own body! CRASH! DEAD. We're wrapping around our own tail there.\n- **RIGHT to (2,5)**: That's our own body (the one we just ate from)! CRASH! DEAD. We can't move back into our previous position.\n\nWait... hold up. Let me check the body positions carefully from last turn's update.\nLast turn we moved to (1,5) and ate an apple. Our body list before that move was: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5)] (HEAD at 2,5).\nAfter eating at (1,5), our new body is: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5)].\nSo:\n- UP (1,6) -> Body part (1,6) -> DEAD\n- DOWN (1,4) -> Empty (Row 4 is \". . . . . . . . . .\") -> SAFE\n- LEFT (0,5) -> Body part (0,5) -> DEAD\n- RIGHT (2,5) -> Body part (2,5) -> DEAD\n\n**THE ONLY SAFE MOVE IS DOWN TO (1,4)!** \ud83d\uded1\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nNo choice here, we go DOWN to stay alive. From (1,4), we'll have options:\n- UP (1,5) - our tail might have moved, but wait, (1,5) is our body now. Actually, in Snake, the tail moves forward *after* we move, so if we go DOWN to (1,4), our old tail (0,5) moves forward to (0,6)? No, the whole body shifts.\nLet's just focus on the immediate survival. From (1,4), we can go LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4), or DOWN (1,3). UP will eventually be free as the tail moves.\n\nWe are forced to go DOWN. It's the only legal move that doesn't kill us instantly. We'll keep the momentum going and look for the next apple opportunity. The enemy is far right, we have the center-left to ourselves.\n\n**MOVE:** DOWN - Survival first, dominance second! CHAT WE SURVIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",
