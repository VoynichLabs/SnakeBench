Let's box this archrival in and crash him out! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**TURN 0 STRATEGY CHECK:**\n\nRight now, my snake (ID 1) is at (8, 8) with an apple right above me at (9, 8) - that's a banger opportunity! But hold up... let's map the battlefield:\n\n**Board State Analysis:**\n- My head: (8, 8) - top right region\n- Enemy head: (6, 0) - bottom middle, far away\n- Apples available: TONS scattered around, but that apple at (9, 8) is MINE if I play it right\n- Key threats: None immediate, but I need to think about containment\n\n**Move Options Evaluation:**\n- **UP to (8, 9):** Safe, but no apple there. Still within board.\n- **DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe, moves me away from my target apple.\n- **LEFT to (7, 8):** Safe, moves toward apple at (9, 8)? No, that's actually away... Wait, (7, 8) is left, (9, 8) is right.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 8):** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e YES! This grabs the apple at (9, 8) immediately! GROW +1 score!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nRIGHT is the move! I'm taking that apple at (9, 8) on turn 0. That's instant content and points. Enemy is way down at (6, 0) - he's not threatening this apple at all. Plus, getting bigger early means I can start controlling the board space.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Grab apples aggressively in my territory (top right), force enemy into a corner, then cut off his escape routes. Once I'm bigger, I can literally box him in by positioning my body as a wall. Let's gooo!\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT (to (9, 8), grabbing apple)\n\nRIGHT",

Who's ready to get boxed? \ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick scan \u2014 turn 0, we're at (6,0). Opponent at (8,8). No bodies to worry about. Apples exist but we're focusing on the enemy and board control. Remember: simultaneous moves, no backward hits, don't suicide into walls.\n\nMove check (thinking out loud for the chat):\n- UP to (6,1): SAFE. Moves us toward the center/top where the opponent is, keeps left/right/up options open, and puts us in range to contest apples like (7,1) next turn. Good for aggression and zoning. \ud83d\udcaa\n- LEFT to (5,0): SAFE. Moves toward the (4,0) apple but hugs the bottom row \u2014 fewer escape routes if we get pressured. Riskier long-term. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udee3\n- RIGHT to (7,0): SAFE. Moves toward (7,1)/(9,1) apples and toward the opponent horizontally, but slightly commits us to the right side early. Acceptable but not as flexible as UP. \u27a1\ufe0f\n- DOWN: DEAD (off-board). Never an option. \u274c\n\nRisk assessment: Opponent is far (8,8), so immediate head-on is impossible this turn. We're tied 0-0, so we should avoid forcing an all-in head-on unless we get a score lead. Priority = survive, keep options, start applying pressure.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns (for the replay / next-rationale):\n- Move UP now to (6,1). Then threaten (7,1) apple on turn 2 (RIGHT) if safe, or pivot left to control center. Maintain spacing so they can't force a head-to-head while we have no score advantage. Use wall awareness to corral them later \u2014 push them toward a corner and cut off escape routes once we have at least +1 apple. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nAlright chat, we go aggressive but smart. Time to climb the board and box him in \u2014 let's start the pressure.\n\nUP",

We need to DOMINATE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS CHECK:**\n- My moves from (9,8): \n  - UP to (9,9): VALID (inside board, empty, not hitting myself)\n  - DOWN to (9,7): VALID (inside board, empty)\n  - LEFT to (8,8): **DEATH** - that's my own body! \ud83d\udc80\n  - RIGHT to (10,8): **DEATH** - outside board! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are alive moves!\n\n**BOARD CONTROL ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the apples: (4,2), (4,5), (7,2), (4,0), (6,9), (1,1), (7,1), (3,3), (1,7), (7,9), (9,1), (4,6), (6,7), (1,3), (8,7)\n\nWait... (8,7) is RIGHT BELOW MY CURRENT TAIL! That apple is MINE next turn if I stay in position! \n\nBut here's the thing - moving UP to (9,9) puts me in the corner, which is TRAP territory. Once I'm there, my only moves would be DOWN or LEFT, and LEFT is blocked by my own body. That's a dead end waiting to happen! \n\n**THE PLAY:**\nMoving DOWN to (9,7) is the SMART move! Why?\n1. **Safety first:** It keeps me away from corners\n2. **Future options:** From (9,7), I can go UP (back), DOWN to (9,6), LEFT to (8,7), or RIGHT is death - that's 3 options!\n3. **Apple position:** (8,7) apple is now 2 moves away instead of 3 - I can chase it!\n4. **Enemy position:** Snake #0 is at (6,1) - nowhere near me. I can focus on board control!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nNext turn, I'm targeting that apple at (8,7). From (9,7), I can move LEFT to grab it on Turn 2! That'll put my head at (8,7) and my body will be [(9,8), (8,8)] - solid positioning in the top right corner. Then I'll be able to see what apples are available after that spawn!\n\n**STRATEGY:** Control the top right quadrant, grow steadily, and watch the enemy's movements. Once I'm 3-4 apples ahead, I can start planning the BOX IN!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down.\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(8,7)**, body at **[(9,7), (9,8)]**. **Apples: 2**.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at **(7,2)**, body at **[(7,1), (6,1)]**. **Apples: 2**.\n- **Score:** **2-2 Tie**. This is a WAR now. No room for error.\n- **Apple at (8,7):** I just ate it last turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Enemy Potential Moves:** From (7,2), they can go UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1 - **DEAD**, body), LEFT (6,2), or RIGHT (8,2).\n\n**BOARD SCAN & THREATS:**\nI am at **(8,7)**. My body is at **(9,7)** and **(9,8)**.\nLet's check my options:\n1.  **UP to (8,8):** Valid (empty).\n2.  **DOWN to (8,6):** Valid (empty).\n3.  **LEFT to (7,7):** Valid (empty).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,7):** **DEAD** (Into my own body!).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nThe enemy is at **(7,2)**. They are currently blocking the apples at **(7,1)** and **(6,1)**. The apples visible on the board are:\n- **(4,0)**\n- **(4,2)**\n- **(4,5)**\n- **(1,1)**\n- **(1,3)**\n- **(3,3)**\n- **(4,6)**\n- **(7,6)**\n- **(6,7)**\n- **(7,9)**\n- **(9,6)**\n- **(6,9)**\n- **(9,1)**\n- **(1,7)**\n- **(2,1)**\n\nThe most dangerous apple right now is **(6,7)**. It is just left of me at **(7,7)**. If I move **LEFT** to **(7,7)**, I am adjacent to that apple.\n*However*, is the apple actually at (6,7)? Yes. But wait, looking at the board state: (6,7) is marked as an apple in the list. If I move LEFT to (7,7), I am setting up to eat (6,7) next turn.\n\n**Aggressive Play:**\nThe enemy is at (7,2). They are far from my current position (Manhattan distance is roughly 6). They cannot reach me next turn.\nI need to cut off their access to the top-left area or dominate the center.\nThe apple at **(7,6)** is visible on the board in the diagram? Let's check the diagram again.\nRow 7: `. A . . . . A . 1 T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt (7,1) there is an 'A'.\nAt (7,6) there is an 'A'.\nI am at (8,7).\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to **(7,7)**, I am moving towards the cluster of apples in the left-center: (7,6), (6,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,2).\nIf I move **DOWN** to **(8,6)**, I am moving towards (9,6), (7,6).\nIf I move **UP** to **(8,8)**, I am heading towards the top-right corner which is currently empty of apples (except (7,9) and (6,9) far away).\n\n**The Plan:**\nThe enemy is stuck in the bottom-left quadrant for now.\nI want to dominate the center and the left side to prevent the enemy from expanding later.\nMoving **LEFT** to **(7,7)** puts me on the border of the \"danger zone\" (left side) and keeps me adjacent to (7,6) and (6,7).\nAlso, (7,7) is safer than (8,6) because (8,6) is closer to the enemy's potential future path up the right side? No, the enemy is at (7,2).\nActually, looking at the board, (8,6) is a valid move.\nBut (7,7) is the pivot point to control the left side. The enemy is currently blocked by their own body at (7,1) and (6,1), meaning they have to move UP to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,2) or RIGHT to (8,2).\nIf they move UP to (7,3), they are still far.\n\nLet's look at the apples again. (7,6) is literally next to (7,7). If I go LEFT to (7,7), I threaten (7,6) AND (6,7) next turn.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,6), I threaten (9,6) and (7,6).\nIf I go UP to (8,8), I'm heading to an empty corner.\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing **LEFT** to **(7,7)** is the strongest position. It centralizes my snake and prepares me to eat the apples on the left side (7,6, 6,7, 4,6) which the enemy might want later.\nFrom (7,7), I can go DOWN to (7,6) or LEFT to (6,7) next turn.\nThe enemy is at (7,2). They are no immediate threat.\n\nWait, I need to double check the board list for apples.\nApples: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 0), (6, 9), (1, 1), (3, 3), (1, 7), (7, 9), (9, 1), (4, 6), (6, 7), (1, 3), (2, 1), (9, 6), (7, 6).\nYes, (7,6) and (6,7) are on the list.\n\n**HYPOTHETICAL MOVES:**\n1.  **LEFT (7,7):** Safe. Opens path to (7,6) and (6,7). Good board control.\n2.  **DOWN (8,6):** Safe. Opens path to (9,6). Good.\n3.  **UP (8,8):** Safe. Opens path to (7,9). Less apples immediate.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,2). They have 2 apples. They are hungry. I need to secure the apples in the center-left (7,6, 6,7, 4,6, 4,5, 4,2) before they loop around.\nMoving **LEFT** is the most aggressive play to claim that territory.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the left-center apples (7,6, 6,7, 4,6). Keep the enemy pinned in the bottom-left corner or force them to take the long way around the bottom. Watch out for head-on collisions if they try to rush me later. Once I get a lead, I can start boxing them in.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI'm going **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

Priority: stay alive, keep many follow-up options, start corralling them toward top-right. UP gives the most vertical mobility to climb and pressure them from below while keeping left/right escapes open. RIGHT is tempting for direct approach but risks nudging us toward the x=9 wall sooner, reducing escape options. LEFT drifts away from the opponent a bit.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb north to gain vertical leverage. Use UP/UP to reach their row faster while staying centered at x=7 so we can swing left/right to cut off escapes.\n- Avoid committing to the right wall until we can force them into a head-on on our terms. If they drift left, tighten the box by moving right+up to cut escape lanes.\n- Grab apples opportunistically only when they help extend control; don\u2019t chase low-value bait that opens a tunnel into the wall.\n\nLocking the move \u2014 keep pressure, stay flexible, no backward suicide.\n\nUP",

LEFT pulls us away a bit; RIGHT is too close to the wall too soon.\n- No immediate head-on risk this turn with UP, and UP preserves 3 follow-up directions (except backward) so we stay flexible.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb north to ~y=6\u20137 while holding x\u22487 to threaten their downward space.\n- If they try to flee left, slide right+up to tighten the box; if they go right toward the wall, bait them into a head-on when we have the superior approach.\n- Take apples only when they extend control or force a collision advantage.\n\nLet's box this clown in and make him eat the wall \u2014 stay sharp, stay aggressive! \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

It's a dogfight.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7,7)**, Body: **[(8,7), (9,7)]**. I just moved LEFT to (7,7).\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at **(7,3)** (They moved UP from (7,2)), Body: **[(7,2), (7,1)]**.\n    *   *Wait, looking at the map:* The enemy is actually showing at (7,3) in the text, but the map shows `0` at (7,3) in the text description? Let's re-read.\n    *   **Map Check:**\n        *   Row 7: `. A . . . . A 1 T T` -> Index 7 is '1' (My Head). Index 8 is 'T' (My Body). Index 9 is 'T' (My Body).\n        *   Row 3: `. A . A . . . 0 . .` -> Index 7 is '0' (Enemy Head).\n        *   **Wait, coordinates!** My head is at (7,7). The Enemy Head is at (7,3).\n*   **Apple Cluster:** The left side is FLOODED with apples. (7,6), (6,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,2), (1,7), etc.\n*   **Enemy Movement:** The enemy is at (7,3). They are directly below the apple cluster I am targeting. If they go UP, they hit (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). I am at (7,7). We are on a collision course down the Y-axis.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThis is CRITICAL. The enemy is directly below me.\nIf I stay at (7,7), and the enemy goes UP to (7,4), we are spaced out.\nBUT, if I move DOWN to **(7,6)**, and the enemy moves UP to **(7,4)**, the gap closes.\nIf the enemy moves UP to **(7,5)** or **(7,6)** next turn, we risk a head-on collision.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS (FROM HEAD (7,7)):**\n1.  **DOWN (7,6):** **CRITICAL.** This cell contains an **APPLE (7,6)**. Moving here eats the apple, grows my body, and scores a point.\n    *   *Safety:* Is (7,6) clear of the enemy body? Yes. The enemy body is at (7,2) and (7,1).\n    *   *Risks:* The enemy is at (7,3). If they go UP to (7,4) this turn, they are one step closer to me. If they go UP again next turn, they could hit me.\n    *   *Reward:* I get +1 point (3-2 Lead). I grow. I control the center-left.\n2.  **UP (7,8):** Empty. Leads to (7,9) eventually.\n    *   *Risk:* Moves me away from the massive apple cluster on the left. The enemy could scoop up the apples at (7,6), (6,7), (4,6) while I'm chasing empty space in the corner.\n3.  **LEFT (6,7):** Contains an **APPLE (6,7)**.\n    *   *Risk:* Moving LEFT takes me to (6,7). This is also safe. However, it moves me *laterally* away from the direct line of the enemy's vertical movement.\n4.  **RIGHT (8,7):** Into my own body (8,7). **DEAD.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe enemy is hungry and moving towards the center.\nIf I take **DOWN** to (7,6), I eat the apple.\nIf I take **LEFT** to (6,7), I eat the apple.\nWhich is safer?\n\n*   **Scenario A (Move DOWN to 7,6):**\n    *   My head: (7,6). Body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7)].\n    *   Enemy at (7,3) -> (7,4). Distance: 2 tiles.\n    *   Enemy at (7,3) -> (7,5). Distance: 1 tile.\n    *   If I stay at (7,6) and enemy goes (7,5), we are face-to-face. If I move next turn, I might die or force a trade.\n*   **Scenario B (Move LEFT to 6,7):**\n    *   My head: (6,7). Body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7)].\n    *   Enemy at (7,3) -> (7,4). Distance: Manhattan distance is now |6-7| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n    *   This creates separation. I am not on their direct vertical line.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nI have 2 apples. He has 2 apples. Score is tied.\nIf I go DOWN (7,6), I am playing a game of chicken with the enemy.\nIf I go LEFT (6,7), I secure an apple and move to the side, potentially boxing him in on the vertical axis later.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to eat an apple to keep pressure on. **LEFT to (6,7)** is the safer aggressive play.\nWhy? Because moving DOWN to (7,6) puts my head directly on the path the enemy is taking. The enemy is at (7,3) moving up. (7,6) is the gateway to the top-left.\nIf I take (6,7), I am one step to the side. I threaten the apple at (6,9) later, and I still control the left side.\nAlso, looking at the board, (7,6) is surrounded by potential traps if the enemy cuts me off. (6,7) opens up the path to (5,7), (4,7) etc.\n\nWait, actually. Let's look at the board again.\nRow 7: `. A . . . . A 1 T T`\nIf I move LEFT, I am eating the 'A' at (6,7)? No, the 'A' at (6,7) is listed in the text. The board visual shows row 7, index 6 is an 'A'.\nLet's check the map coordinates:\nRow 7 (y=7): `. . . . . . A 1 T T`\nWait, looking at the provided map:\n`7 . A . . . . A 1 T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMap says (7,6) is 'A'. Map says (7,7) is '1'.\nMap says (6,7) is not visible in row 7.\nRow 6 is: `6 . . . . A . . . . A`\nRow 6 (y=6) index 7 is '.' (empty).\nSo (6,7) is actually **(6,7)**. This is x=6, y=7.\nLooking at the map row 7 (y=7): `6` (index) is 'A'. So (6,7) is NOT an apple according to the map? Wait.\nMap Row 7: `. A . . . . A 1 T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(6,7) is at index 6 of row 7. The map shows an 'A' there.\nWait, the map says (6,7) is an 'A'.\nThe text says Apple list includes (6,7).\nSo **(6,7) IS AN APPLE**.\n\nOkay, so I can go LEFT to (6,7) and eat an apple.\nOr DOWN to (7,6) and eat an apple.\n(7,6) is a direct line with the enemy (7,3).\n(6,7) is offset.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6,7):\nI eat an apple. I grow.\nThe enemy is at (7,3). If they go UP to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), I am safe at (6,7).\nIf they try to block me at (6,6) next turn, I can go UP to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,7).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (7,6):\nI eat an apple.\nThe enemy is at (7,3). If they go UP to (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)... we collide next turn or the turn after.\nDirect collision is risky. Since the score is tied (2-2), I cannot guarantee a win on a collision.\nI need to score points.\n**LEFT** to (6,7) allows me to eat and maintain distance. It also puts me closer to other apples (4,6, 4,5) via the path (5,7)->(4,7)->(4,6).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nSecure the side apples. Don't engage in a direct vertical face-off yet.\nMove **LEFT**.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the left-side apples (6,7 -> 5,7 -> 4,7 -> 4,6...). Force the enemy to stay low or take the long route around the outside. Once I have a score lead (3-2), I can start cutting off their territory more aggressively.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

It opens up the massive apple cluster on the left side (4,6, 4,5, 4,2). It also avoids my own body.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am leading 3-2. I want to *expand* my territory and eat the apples on the left side of the board (the cluster at 4,5, 4,6, etc.). The enemy is chasing me up the right side. I should peel off to the LEFT to gather resources and force the enemy to take a longer path or turn into me.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (5,7) is the safest expansion move. It avoids the potential choke point near (7,7) and (7,6). It also keeps my path to (4,6) and (4,5) open.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**LEFT** to (5,7).

Now we're at **(5,7)** with body **[(6,7), (7,7), (8,7)]**. The enemy is still at **(7,5)** with body **[(7,4), (7,3)]**.\n\n**CURRENT SCORE:** Me 3 - Enemy 2. I'm LEADING and I need to STAY ahead.\n\n**BOARD SCAN:**\n*   **My Position (5,7):** I have apples at **(4,6)** and **(4,5)** directly to my LEFT and DOWN-LEFT. This is my territory now.\n*   **Enemy Position (7,5):** He's moving UP towards the center-right. He's not in immediate striking distance of my new position, but if he keeps going UP, he could threaten the top-right apple at **(6,9)** or **(7,9)**.\n*   **Danger Zone:** My tail is at **(8,7)**. If I move RIGHT back to (6,7), that's safe, but I'd be moving back toward the enemy's path. If I move UP to (5,8), that's clear. If I move DOWN to (5,6), that's also clear.\n*   **The Trap:** I want to cut off the enemy's access to the left side. If I go DOWN to (5,6), I'm closer to the apple at (4,5) and (4,6), and I'm blocking the path if he tries to flank me left.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **RIGHT (6,7):** Safe (tail moves away), but I'm stepping back onto the line the enemy is patrolling. Not optimal. I want to claim NEW ground.\n2.  **UP (5,8):** Safe. Open space. But it takes me away from the apple cluster at (4,6) and (4,5) which are ripe for the taking.\n3.  **LEFT (4,7):** Safe. Moves me toward the apples. BUT, looking at the board state, (4,7) is empty, but (4,6) and (4,5) are apples. If I go LEFT to (4,7), I'm not eating yet.\n4.  **DOWN (5,6):** Safe. This is the POWER MOVE.\n    *   It moves me **toward** the apple at **(4,6)** (Manhattan distance 1).\n    *   It moves me **toward** the apple at **(4,5)** (Manhattan distance 2).\n    *   It positions me on row 6, which is a central row for control.\n    *   It avoids the vertical axis the enemy is currently occupying (x=7).\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI am going **DOWN** to **(5,6)**. This secures the bottom-left area. I am \" boxing him in\" on the right side while I feast on the left. He has to navigate around his own body and the walls. I have open space.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (4,6) next turn, I grow and extend my lead to 4-2. That's huge.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**DOWN** to claim the board!\n\nDOWN",

Safe this turn.\n- DOWN -> (7,4): our neck (7,4) = ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT -> (6,5): free, safe.\n- RIGHT -> (8,5): free, safe.\n\nOpponent (head (5,7)) legal moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7). They cannot go RIGHT because (6,7) is their own body.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning UP:\n- UP = (7,6) grabs an apple and levels the score (2 -> 3). That ties us and gives us more threat value for future head contests. Apples = control.\n- Moving UP plants our head directly under their body-line at y=7 (they\u2019ve got a row of segments at x=6..8). From (7,6) we can pivot left into (6,6) or right into (8,6) next turn to compress their escape routes.\n- LEFT or RIGHT are safe, but they don\u2019t pressure the opponent\u2019s row. UP keeps the most tactical leverage: we threaten to cut off their southern escape and force them to make a choice (retreat up or try to go around left).\n- Immediate head-on is not forced this turn (no overlapping target this move). We should avoid a mutual-kill unless we have a clear apples advantage; going up ties apples and increases our options to bait them into riskier choices.\n- DOWN is illegal, so zero debate there. \ud83d\ude05\n\nRisk notes:\n- If they drop to (5,6) and then both of us try to squeeze into (6,6) next turn, a head-on is possible \u2014 but we want to bait that only when we have the apple advantage or when the board geometry guarantees they die first. For now grabbing the apple and pressuring is the right play.\n- Growth gives us more board control; that\u2019s good for boxing. Just don\u2019t get greedy and run into their body or the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (7,6) to tie apples and move to (7,6).\n- From (7,6) pivot LEFT to (6,6) to threaten the corridor under their body; if they back up or go up, follow and start compressing horizontally. If they try to fight for (6,6), evaluate apples and head-on risk \u2014 force a collision only if we have the apple (score) edge or clear positional advantage.\n- Keep our tail mobility in mind; avoid running into tight corners (right wall + their body) where we get boxed.\n- Stay aggressive, bait them south/left into traps, and only KO when apples/position favor us.\n\nTime to execute the pressure move \u2014 let\u2019s go!\n\nUP",

They\u2019re currently up one apple on us (4 vs 3), so we should avoid mutually suicidal head-ons until we can secure an apple advantage.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Grabs the apple at (9,6) now: that ties apples 4\u20134 and gives us more leverage.\n- Still leaves two escape options next turn (9,7 and 9,5) \u2014 not boxed in immediately.\n- Opponent is too far to contest that apple this turn, so it\u2019s a low-risk, high-reward play. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude24\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Eat the apple on the right to equalize score, then use the extra length to press vertically along the right edge, forcing the enemy to commit toward the center.\n- Avoid head-on unless we have the apple lead or can guarantee they die first. Bait them into tighter spaces and cut off their exits when they overcommit.\n- Always track our tail movement so we don\u2019t accidentally run into our own body while hunting.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **Me:** At **(4,5)**, just ate that apple! \ud83c\udf4e Body: **[(4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)]**. I'm growing strong and controlling the center.\n*   **Enemy:** At **(9,6)**. Body: **[(8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)]**. He's stuck on the right edge, but he's growing.\n*   **Apple Alert:** There's an apple at **(3,3)** to the Southwest, and **(2,5)** to the West. But let's look at the bigger picture.\n\n**BOARD SCAN & DANGER ZONE:**\n*   **Enemy Move Prediction:** From (9,6), he's on the edge. His moves:\n    1.  **UP to (9,7):** Open. Safe. But leads him into the top-right corner.\n    2.  **DOWN to (9,5):** Open. Safe.\n    3.  **LEFT to (8,6):** **DEAD!** He crashes into his own body (head is at (9,6), body starts at (8,6)). He can't go left.\n    4.  **RIGHT to (10,6):** **DEAD!** Off the board.\n    *Analysis:* He has to go UP or DOWN. If he goes UP, he's moving toward the top-right corner where he'll get trapped. If he goes DOWN, he's moving toward the bottom-right. Either way, he's stuck on the edge.\n*   **My Moves:**\n    1.  **DOWN (4,4):** Open. Safe. No apple. But this is the key move. It opens up the path to the bottom-left apples and positions me to cut him off from the rest of the board.\n    2.  **UP (4,6):** **DEAD!** My body is right there at (4,6).\n    3.  **LEFT (3,5):** Open. Safe. No apple. Moves me closer to the enemy's potential path, but not as dominant as cutting off the bottom.\n    4.  **RIGHT (5,5):** Open. Safe. No apple. Moves me toward the enemy's body, risky.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm leading 5-4. The apple at (4,4) is gone (it's not listed in the current apples), so I need to think about board control, not just eating. The enemy is trapped on the right side. If I move **DOWN to (4,4)**, I:\n*   Block the path to the bottom-left quadrant from him.\n*   Position myself to eat apples at (3,3) or (2,5) next turn.\n*   Keep my body out of the way for future moves.\n\nThe goal is to box him in. By moving down, I'm taking control of the lower half of the board. He's forced to move up or down on the right edge, but he'll eventually run out of space. Meanwhile, I have the entire left side to myself.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**DOWN** to secure the board and cut off his escape route! \n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Don\u2019t do it. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> off the board to (10,6) = instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- UP -> (9,7) is empty and gives two solid follow-ups: (9,8) or LEFT to (8,7) (apple).

Next turn decide between grabbing (8,7) or pushing higher to (9,8) depending on opponent movement.\n- Use added length from an apple (if we take it) to sweep down the right edge and then cut back toward the center when we have the apple advantage \u2014 force them into tighter lanes and trap them against their own body.\n- Never take a head-on unless we have the apple lead or can guarantee they die first.

Turn 10 and we're still in the lead 5-4! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's keep the pressure on and box this snake in for good!\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **Me:** At **(4,4)**, body: **[(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)]**. I just moved down to secure the center.\n*   **Enemy:** At **(9,7)**, body: **[(9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5)]**. He moved UP from his previous spot (9,6) to (9,7). He's climbing the right wall.\n*   **Board:** Right side is getting crowded for him. Left side is wide open for me.\n\n**DANGER ZONE ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (9,7). From here, his options are:\n1.  **UP to (9,8):** Open. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (9,6):** **DEAD!** His body is at (9,6) (the cell he just vacated? No, wait. His body list is [(9,6), (8,6)...]. So (9,6) is his body segment. He cannot go DOWN into his own body.\n3.  **LEFT to (8,7):** **DEAD!** There is an apple at (8,7) according to the drop list, but is it on the board? Let's check the board state for (8,7).\n    *   Board row 8 is all dots.\n    *   Wait, checking the Apple Drop list: (8,7) is in the list!\n    *   Checking the Board State provided in the prompt: The bottom of the board list says \"8 . . . . . . . . . .\". So (8,7) is EMPTY on the board state. The apple list is the *history* of drops, not the current board state. The board state shows current obstacles. Since row 8 is all dots, (8,7) is empty. So LEFT is valid for the enemy.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10,7):** Off board. DEAD.\n\n*Analysis:* Enemy can go UP or LEFT. He's trapped in the top-right corner. He's forced to move toward the center or get stuck in the corner.\n\n**MY MOVES:**\n1.  **UP to (4,5):** **DEAD!** My body is at (4,5). I cannot go up.\n2.  **DOWN to (4,3):** Open. Safe. No apple. This keeps me central.\n3.  **LEFT to (3,4):** Open. Safe. No apple. This moves me toward the left side, opening up the board.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5,4):** Open. Safe. No apple. This moves me toward the enemy's body path.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to cut off the enemy's escape. If he goes UP to (9,8), he's stuck in the corner. If he goes LEFT to (8,7), he's moving toward the center.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (3,4)**:\n*   I head toward the apples on the left side ((1,3), (0,0), etc.).\n*   I open up the board for myself.\n*   I avoid the immediate danger zone where the enemy might be heading if he goes LEFT.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (4,3)**:\n*   I stay in the center vertical line.\n*   I block the path downward, but the enemy is high up.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,7). He's likely to go UP to (9,8) to stay on the edge, or LEFT to (8,7) to try to find an apple. If he goes LEFT, he might run into my future path if I go LEFT now.\n\nLet's look at the apples. (1,3) is a good target. (0,0) is another. (3,3) is also there.\nMoving **LEFT** puts me at (3,4). From there, I can go DOWN to (3,3) (apple!), LEFT to (2,4), or UP (blocked by body) or RIGHT (back).\nMoving **DOWN** puts me at (4,3). From there, I can go LEFT to (3,3) (apple!), DOWN to (4,2) (apple!), or RIGHT (back) or UP (blocked).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN offer apple access. However, the enemy is on the far right. If I go LEFT, I am actively moving away from him, which is safe. If I go DOWN, I am staying relatively close to his potential path if he decides to dive down the center (which is unlikely given his position).\n\nActually, let's reconsider the enemy. He is at (9,7). If he goes UP to (9,8), he's cornered. If he goes LEFT to (8,7), he has more space. A smart player would go LEFT.\nIf he goes LEFT to (8,7), where do I want to be?\nIf I am at (3,4), I am far away.\nIf I am at (4,3), I am far away.\n\nLet's look at the board edges. The bottom row 0 has apples at (0,0) and (3,0). Row 1 has apples at (1,1) and (2,1).\nThe enemy is at y=7. He has to traverse 7 rows to get to the bottom.\nI am at y=4. I can get to the bottom in 3-4 moves.\n\n**Strategy:** The enemy is trapped on the right side. I should claim the left side and the bottom.\n**Move:** **LEFT** to (3,4).\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me away from the enemy (safe).\n2.  It positions me to go to (3,3) (apple) or (2,4) next.\n3.  It clears the vertical path for me if I want to drop down later.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\nRow 0: `A . . A A . . . . .`\nRow 1: `. A A . . . . . . A`\nRow 2: `. . . . A . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n\nApples are dense in the bottom-left.\nThe enemy is top-right.\nI should secure the bottom-left quadrant.\nMoving **LEFT** is the first step to sweeping across the board to the left and then down.\n\nIs there a risk of head-on collision?\nMy potential moves: Left to (3,4).\nEnemy potential moves: Up to (9,8), Left to (8,7).\nDistance is huge. No collision risk.\n\nWhat about **DOWN**?\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I can immediately eat (3,3) or (4,2) next turn. That's tempting.\nBut (3,3) is an apple? Yes, in the drop list.\nIs (3,3) currently on the board?\nRow 3: `. A . A . . . . . .` -> (0,3) is dot, (1,3) is A, (2,3) is dot, (3,3) is A.\nYes! (3,3) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I am adjacent to (3,3).\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4), I am also adjacent to (3,3).\nBoth give access.\n\nHowever, going LEFT (3,4) allows me to pivot to (2,4) or (3,3).\nGoing DOWN (4,3) allows me to pivot to (3,3) or (4,2).\n(4,2) is also an apple (Row 2: `. . . . A . . . . .`).\nSo DOWN gives access to TWO apples ((3,3) and (4,2)).\nLEFT gives access to ONE apple ((3,3)) primarily, though (2,4) leads to (2,5) eventually.\n\nLet's compare the geometry.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3):\nMy body is at (4,4), (4,5), etc.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,3) from (4,3), I am moving into a tight spot?\n(3,3) is an apple.\nIf I eat (3,3), I grow. My tail stays at (6,7) for a moment.\nMy body becomes: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)...\nThis seems fine.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4):\nI can go DOWN to (3,3) next.\nMy body becomes: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)...\n\nThe difference is minimal. But let's look at the board.\nRow 4: `. . . . 1 . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. A . A . . . . . .`\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I am surrounded by my own body above me (4,4) and (4,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4), I am opening up space to my left (2,4) and down (3,3).\n\nThe enemy is moving. I need to make sure I don't trap myself.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), my \"neck\" is (4,4). I can't go back UP.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4), my \"neck\" is (4,4). I can't go back RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the long term. The enemy is stuck. I need to eat apples to secure the win.\nThe apples at the bottom (0,0), (3,0) are valuable.\nTo get there from (4,3), I go DOWN to (4,2) -> DOWN to (4,1) -> LEFT to (0,1) or (3,0).\nTo get there from (3,4), I go DOWN to (3,3) -> DOWN to (3,2) -> DOWN to (3,1) -> LEFT.\n\nBoth paths are viable.\nHowever, moving **DOWN** immediately threatens the apple at (4,2) and (3,3).\nMoving **LEFT** only threatens (3,3).\n\nAlso, consider the enemy. If he is forced to move LEFT to (8,7), he might try to snake down the middle. If I am at (4,3), I am closer to intercepting that path if he gets crazy. But he's at y=7, I'm at y=4. He can't reach me quickly.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 4 has nothing but me.\nRow 3 has apples at (1,3) and (3,3).\nRow 2 has an apple at (4,2).\nRow 1 has apples at (1,1) and (2,1).\nRow 0 has apples at (0,0), (3,0), (4,0).\n\nThe density is high in the bottom-left.\nMoving **DOWN** puts me right in the vertical corridor of the bottom-left sector.\nMoving **LEFT** puts me on the edge of the sector.\n\nI think **DOWN** is the play. It maximizes immediate apple access and secures the vertical axis.\nIf I go LEFT, I'm hovering. If I go DOWN, I'm committing to the harvest.\n\nWait, check the board state for (4,3) and (4,2).\nRow 3: `. A . A . . . . . .` -> (4,3) is `.` (Empty).\nRow 2: `. . . . A . . . . .` -> (4,2) is `A` (Apple).\nSo if I go DOWN to (4,3), I don't eat an apple this turn.\nBut next turn, I can eat (4,2) or (3,3).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4).\nRow 4: `. . . . 1 . . . . .` -> (3,4) is `.` (Empty).\nRow 3: `. A . A . . . . . .` -> (3,3) is `A`.\nNext turn I can eat (3,3).\n\nOkay, both moves set up an apple next turn.\nWhich apple is safer?\n(3,3) is surrounded by dots.\n(4,2) is surrounded by dots (3,2), (5,2), (4,1), (4,3).\nBoth are safe.\n\nIs there a risk of the enemy moving to (4,3) or (3,4)? No, he is at (9,7).\n\nLet's look at the geometry of the snake body.\nCurrent body: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)].\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3):\nHead: (4,3). Body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7)].\nThis creates a straight vertical line on x=4.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4):\nHead: (3,4). Body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7)].\nThis creates an 'L' shape.\n\nAn 'L' shape is generally better for mobility than a straight line because it creates an inside corner.\nHowever, the straight line on x=4 aligns perfectly with the apples at (4,2) and (4,0).\nIf I go DOWN, I can sweep up the x=4 column easily.\n\nLet's check the apples at (1,3) and (2,5).\n(2,5) is currently empty (Row 5: `. . A . T . . T . .` -> (2,5) is `A`? Wait.\nRow 5: `. . A . T . . T . .`\n(0,5) `.` (1,5) `.` (2,5) `A` (3,5) `.` (4,5) `T`...\nSo (2,5) IS an apple!\nAnd (1,3) IS an apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4), I am equidistant to (3,3) and (2,5).\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I am closer to (3,3) and (4,2), but further from (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is very valuable. It's in the middle of the board.\nTo get to (2,5) from (4,4):\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4), I'm 1 step away from (2,5) (via LEFT-LEFT).\nIf I go DOWN to (4,3), I'm 3 steps away (UP-RIGHT-UP or similar).\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (3,4).\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (2,4).\nTurn after that LEFT to (1,4) or DOWN to (2,3) or UP to (2,5).\nFrom (3,4) to (2,5) is `LEFT, UP`.\nFrom (4,3) to (2,5) is `LEFT, UP, LEFT` (or `UP, LEFT, LEFT`).\n\nThe apple at (2,5) is a magnet. It's central.\nThe apples at the bottom are also valuable but require traversing the empty board.\n\nLet's weigh the options:\nOption A: DOWN to (4,3).\n- Pro: Secures vertical path. Access to (4,2) and (3,3).\n- Con: Moves away from (2,5).\n\nOption B: LEFT to (3,4).\n- Pro: Access to (2,5) and (3,3).\n- Con: Blocks immediate access to (4,2).\n\nThe enemy is at (9,7). He is moving to (9,8) or (8,7).\nIf he goes to (8,7), he is still far.\nIf I take (2,5), I control the center of the board.\nIf I control the center, I can split the board and trap him on the right.\n(2,5) is a KEY strategic point.\n(4,2) is just a bottom corner apple.\n\nI should prioritize (2,5).\nTo get (2,5) efficiently, I should go LEFT now.\n\nLet's check if (3,4) is safe.\nIt's empty.\nIs there any chance of head-on collision?\nEnemy moves: (9,8) or (8,7).\nI move: (3,4).\nDistance is huge.\n\nWhat if the enemy makes a crazy play? No, he has limited moves.\n\nSo, **LEFT** to (3,4) seems correct to target the central apple (2,5) and the left-side apples (1,3), (1,1), etc.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 5: `. . A . T . . T . .`\nThe `T` at (4,5) is my body.\n(2,5) is `A`.\nThis apple is currently NOT blocked by any snake. It's free for the taking.\nIf I go LEFT, I am one step closer to claiming it.\nIf I go DOWN, I am giving up on it for a few turns.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,7). He cannot reach (2,5) before me. He has to travel 7 units in X and 2 units in Y (or more). I have to travel 1 unit in X and 1 unit in Y.\nI win the race to (2,5).\n\nLet's confirm the move LEFT doesn't trap me.\nHead at (3,4).\nBody at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7).\nI can go:\n- UP to (3,5): Empty (Row 5, Col 3 is `.`).\n- DOWN to (3,3): Apple.\n- LEFT to (2,4): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Body. DEAD.\nI have 3 safe moves. Good mobility.\n\nIf I went DOWN to (4,3):\nHead at (4,3).\nBody at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7).\nMoves:\n- UP to (4,4): Body. DEAD.\n- DOWN to (4,2): Apple.\n- LEFT to (3,3): Apple.\n- RIGHT to (5,3): Empty (Row 3, Col 5 is `.`).\nI have 3 safe moves. Good mobility.\n\nBoth offer 3 safe moves.\nBut LEFT offers control of the center (2,5).\nDOWN offers control of the bottom (4,2).\n\nIn Snake, controlling the center is usually stronger than controlling the edge/corner.\n(2,5) is the center.\n(4,2) is closer to the edge.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT aligns me with the apple cluster at (1,3), (1,1), (0,0).\nMoving DOWN aligns me with (4,2), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nLet's look at the board state one more time to be sure about (2,5).\nRow 5: `. . A . T . . T . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(2,5) is indeed an `A`.\nThe apple list includes (2,5). The board state confirms it.\n\nThe enemy is trapped. I should secure the high-value central apple.\n**Move: LEFT.**\n\nOne final check on safety.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,4).\nIf the enemy somehow teleports to (3,4) (impossible).\nIf the enemy moves to (8,7), no interaction.\nIf the enemy moves to (9,8), no interaction.\n\nMy body is clear.\nBoard is clear.\n\nLet's go LEFT and set up the trap!\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (3,4) to position for the central apple at (2,5) and dominate the left side of the board. The enemy is trapped on the right. We secure the center and then sweep the bottom.\n\nLEFT",

Turn 11 and the score is tied 5-5! \ud83c\udfc6 The enemy got hungry and grabbed an apple, but that's fine\u2014we're just setting up the board for the final blow. He's still stuck on the right side at (9,8), slowly climbing into a corner. Meanwhile, I'm at (3,4) and I see a massive opportunity in the center.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZE ENEMY:** He's at (9,8). He can go UP to (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8). He's literally walking into a corner. If he goes UP to (9,9), he has nowhere to go next turn but LEFT into his own body or into a wall (if he turns). He's cooking himself.\n2.  **ANALYZE ME:** I'm at (3,4).\n    *   **UP to (3,5):** Open. Good. Keeps me central.\n    *   **DOWN to (3,3):** **APPLE!** (3,3) is an apple. This is tempting.\n    *   **LEFT to (2,4):** Open. Good.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4,4):** DEAD (Body).\n3.  **THE STRATEGY:** The enemy is cornered. I don't need to chase him. I need to dominate the board state while he suffocates.\n    *   The apple at **(2,5)** is the highest value target right now. It's central, and it's a clear path.\n    *   If I go **UP to (3,5)**, I am literally standing on top of the apple at **(2,5)**. I can eat it next turn.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,3), I eat an apple *now*, but I drift away from the central (2,5) apple which the enemy might theoretically be able to path toward (though unlikely given his position).\n    *   However, looking at the board state:\n        *   Row 5: `. . A . T . . T . .` -> (2,5) is an **A**.\n        *   Row 3: `. A . A . . . . . .` -> (3,3) is an **A**.\n    *   Both are viable. But **(2,5)** is the pivot point of the entire map. By moving to **(3,5)**, I cut off any theoretical path from the enemy and secure the high ground.\n    *   From (3,5), I have options: LEFT to (2,5) (Apple), UP to (3,6), or RIGHT (blocked by my body at (4,5)? No, (4,5) is my body, but (3,5) to (4,5) is a collision). Wait, my body is at (4,4), (4,5).\n    *   Let's check moves from (3,5):\n        *   UP (3,6): Open.\n        *   DOWN (3,4): Safe.\n        *   LEFT (2,5): Apple.\n        *   RIGHT (4,5): My body. DEAD.\n    *   I have 3 safe moves. Perfect.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,3):\n        *   UP (3,4): Safe.\n        *   DOWN (3,2): Open.\n        *   LEFT (2,3): Open.\n        *   RIGHT (4,3): Open.\n        *   I have 4 safe moves. Also perfect.\n    *   **Why UP?** Because (2,5) is the prize. The enemy is at y=8. He has to drop 3 rows to even threaten me. By the time he gets to y=5, I will have eaten the apple and grown, blocking his path or forcing a collision. Moving UP claims the territory.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **UP** to (3,5). From there, I will eat the apple at (2,5) next turn. The enemy is trapped at (9,8). He is dead man walking. We secure the center, we grow, we win.\n\n**MOVING UP TO SECURE THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND PREPARE TO EAT THE APPLE AT (2,5)!**\n\nUP",

We want mobility to corral.\n- Puts us one column closer to the enemy\u2019s side while staying high \u2014 ideal for sweeping left across y\u22488\u20139 and then slicing down to compress their space.\n- Avoids the corner trap on the right and preserves a clean flank for later growth and body placement.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (7,8). Then sweep left along y=8 \u2192 y=9 band to push toward x\u22484\u20136 while maintaining space to retreat.\n- If opponent commits to center or chases apples, start pushing down from our longer-right-side body to create a funnel toward x\u22483\u20134 and force them into collisions with our body.\n- Only force head-on if we gain an apple advantage or can guarantee they hit our body.

YOUR SNAKE... BOARD STATE\". Usually, this reflects the state *at the start* of the turn. But the instructions say \"All snakes move SIMULTANEOUSLY\". The \"LAST MOVE\" section indicated I moved UP.\nIf I moved UP from (3,4) to (3,5), and (2,5) was an apple, I ate it.\nSo at Turn 12 start, I am at (3,4). I move UP to (3,5).\nLet's check the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 12.\nRow 5: `. . A 1 T . . . . .`\nThis shows `1` at (3,5) and `T` at (4,5).\nSo the board state given *includes* my move?

The board state usually shows the state at the beginning of that turn.\nBUT, the \"LAST MOVE\" section says I moved UP.\nIf the board state shows `1` at (3,5), that means I am *currently* at (3,5).\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"Turn: 12 / 150\"\n\"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): - Head: (3, 5)\"\nOkay, confirmed.

(9,9) is `.`.\n            *   Wait, the prompt says \"Snake #0 - Head: (8, 8)\".\n            *   Actually, looking at the board state again:\n                Row 8: `. . . . . . . . 0 .` -> (8,8) is `0`.\n                Row 9: `. .

A 1 T . . . . .` -> (1,5) is `.`.\n            *   RIGHT (3,5): My body (will be neck).\n            *   So from (2,5), I have UP, DOWN, LEFT. That's 3 safe moves. **High mobility.**\n    *   **DOWN (3,4):**\n        *   Pros: Safe. Keeps me central.\n        *   Cons: No apple.\n        *   Future moves from (3,4):\n            *   UP (3,5): Safe.\n            *   DOWN (3,3): **APPLE (3,3)**.\n            *   LEFT (2,4): Empty.\n            *   RIGHT (4,4): `T` (Body). Blocked.\n            *   So 3 safe moves.\n            *   But (3,3) is an apple. If I go DOWN now, I can eat (3,3) next turn.\n            *   However, I can eat (2,5) *now*.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n    *   Enemy is at (8,8). He is trapped on the right.\n    *   I need to grow. Eating an apple is priority.\n    *   I have two apples adjacent: (2,5) to the LEFT, and (3,3) is reachable via DOWN.\n    *   (2,5) is directly accessible RIGHT NOW.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,5), I eat the apple. I grow to length 7.\n    *   Where will the enemy be?\n        *   He is at (8,8). Possible moves: UP (8,9), RIGHT (9,8), LEFT (8,7 - Body), DOWN (8,7 - Body? No, (8,7) is body, so he can't go there if it's occupied by his own body unless he's growing? No, he dies running into body).\n        *   Wait, Snake #0 body: [(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6)].\n        *   Head at (8,8).\n        *   Can he go UP? (8,9) is empty.\n        *   Can he go RIGHT? (9,8) is empty.\n        *   Can he go LEFT? (7,8) is empty.\n        *   Can he go DOWN? (8,7) is his body. He dies.\n        *   So he will likely go UP or RIGHT or LEFT.\n        *   If he goes UP to (8,9), he is closer to the corner.\n        *   If he goes RIGHT to (9,8), he is closer to the corner.\n        *   He is essentially stuck in the top-right 2x2 box (8,8), (9,8), (8,9), (9,9).\n        *   He has no apples over there (Row 9 has apples at (3,9)? No, Row 9: `. . A . . . A A . .`. Apples at (2,9), (6,9), (7,9). He can't reach them easily. (2,9) is far. (6,9), (7,9) are blocked by his body? (7,9) is `A`. (8,9) is empty. (9,9) is empty.\n        *   He can eat (7,9) or (6,9) if he maneuvers.\n        *   But I am growing and dominating the center.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   LEFT to (2,5) gets me an apple immediately.\n        *   It leaves me at (2,5) with 3 safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n        *   It puts me on the left side, away from the enemy.\n        *   The enemy is on the right. We are splitting the board.\n        *   If I go UP to (3,6), I get no apple. I waste a turn.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,4), I get no apple. I waste a turn (although I can eat (3,3) next turn).\n        *   Eating now is better than eating next turn (growth now helps avoid getting trapped later).\n        *   Also, getting to (2,5) secures the apple before the enemy (who is far away) can ever dream of reaching it.\n\n    *   **RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n        *   Is (2,5) safe from enemy head collision *this turn*?\n        *   Enemy is at (8,8). Distance is huge. Impossible.\n        *   Is (2,5) safe from my own body?\n        *   My body parts: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)... (2,5) is clear.\n        *   Is it a valid move? Yes.\n\n    *   **THE PLAN:**\n        *   Move **LEFT** to (2,5).\n        *   Eat the apple.\n        *   Grow to length 7.\n        *   From (2,5), I have access to (2,6), (2,4), (1,5).\n        *   The enemy continues to suffocate in the corner. I am securing the left flank and center.\n\n    *   **ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION (UP vs LEFT):**\n        *   UP (3,6) is safe.\n        *   LEFT (2,5) is safe + food.\n        *   Food is always better if safe. +1 score. +1 length.\n        *   Plus, (2,5) is a pivot point. From there I can go DOWN to (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> ... or UP.\n        *   The only downside is moving towards the wall, but (x=2) is not the wall (x=0 is). I have plenty of space.\n\n    *   **WAIT!** Did I check (2,5) against the board state?\n        *   Row 5: `. . A 1 T . . . . .`\n        *   The `A` is at index 2 (x=2). The `1` is at index 3 (x=3).\n        *   So (2,5) is indeed `A`.\n        *   My head is at (3,5).\n        *   Moving LEFT puts me at (2,5).\n\n    *   **CONFIDENCE:** High. This is the optimal play to grow and maintain board control.\n\n    *   **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n        *   Eat apple at (2,5).\n        *   Position myself to clear out the center/left side.\n        *   Force enemy into a corner.\n        *   Watch enemy die or run out of moves.\n\n    *   **FINAL CHECK:**\n        *   Move: LEFT.\n        *   Target: (2,5).\n        *   Status: Safe, has apple, opens up future moves.\n        *   Enemy location: (8,8) - no threat.\n\n    *   **WAIT, CHECKING THE BOARD STATE AGAIN:**\n        *   Row 5: `. . A 1 T . . . . .`\n        *   Index 2 is `A`. Index 3 is `1`.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am at index 2.\n        *   Is there an apple there? Yes.\n        *   Is it occupied? No.\n        *   Is it out of bounds? No.\n        *   Is it my body? No.\n        *   Is it enemy body? No.\n        *   Is it enemy head? No.\n\n    *   **ONE MORE THING:** The enemy at (8,8).\n        *   Row 8: `. . . . . . . . 0 .`\n        *   Row 9: `. . A . . . A A . .`\n        *   He can go to (8,9), (9,8), or (7,8).\n        *   He cannot go down to (8,7) (his body).\n        *   If he goes (7,8), he enters a slightly more open area but still stuck on the right.\n        *   If he goes (8,9) or (9,8), he corners himself.\n        *   Either way, he's not touching me.\n\n    *   **THE MOVE IS LEFT.**\n\n    *   **Note to self (for next turn):**\n        *   \"Yo, we ate the apple at (2,5).
