We are both tiny, 1-segment snakes, and the map is WIDE OPEN. This is a land grab, chat, a race to get those juicy apples and box out the opponent! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (5, 0)\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (3, 0)\n*   **Closest Apple:** (4, 0) - This is literally right next to both of us!\n*   **Next Closest Apples:** (5, 1) and (6, 8).\n\n**Immediate Goal:** We need that (4, 0) apple! It's an aggressive early play, but if we get it, we get the lead!\n\n**Evaluating Moves for ID 1 (Me) at (5, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from board edges. Safe from my own body (I have none).\n    *   **Collision Check:** (5, 1) is currently empty but has an apple later in the queue (Apple #6). This move aims for the center of the board.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** It moves towards the next available apple at (5, 1), BUT it's on a future drop list, not active yet. It also moves *away* from the immediate (4, 0) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, -1):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD. Off the board. NOPE.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from board edges and my own body.\n    *   **Collision Check:** This is the TENSION move! Snake #0 is at (3, 0). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0), we collide and BOTH die! \ud83d\udca5 Is Snake #0 likely to move RIGHT? YES, because (4, 0) is an apple!\n    *   **Outcome if collision (4, 0):** DKO. Game over turn 0. NO GOOD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** Moves away from the immediate (4, 0) apple, but gives us space to circle back or head UP towards the wider board.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 0)):**\nSnake #0's best move is also to grab that (4, 0) apple.\n*   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0) -> Collision if I move LEFT.\n*   Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 1) -> Safe, but ignores the immediate apple.\n*   Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 0) -> Moves towards the (2, 0) apple, but it's later in the list.\n\n**The Strategy (Avoid DKO at all costs!):**\nWe are both small. Taking a 50/50 DKO risk on Turn 0 for a small apple is terrible strategy, chat. We need to be the *last* snake standing.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT (likely), and I move LEFT, we die.\n\nWe need to make a safe opening move that positions us well for future apples and gives us control of the center. The current active apples are (6, 8), (0, 2), and (4, 0).\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 0), and Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 1), I get the apple safely. Win.\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 0), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0), we die. Lose.\n\nLet's look at the alternatives. Moving UP to (5, 1) is extremely safe, and it gets us into the wide-open board space, giving us options for the next few turns. It also puts us one step closer to the future apple drops at (5, 8) and (5, 3), and right next to the active apple at (6, 8) when we gain some length.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 0) is also safe, but it's hugging the bottom edge too much, limiting our immediate vertical movement options compared to (5, 1).\n\n**Decision:** We yield the first apple (likely) to establish safety and better central positioning. Moving UP to (5, 1) breaks away from Snake #0's immediate threat corridor and sets us up to aim for the upcoming apples (note the cluster of apples in rows 8 and 9, and also the future (5, 1) apple drop itself).\n\nFuture Plan T+1 onwards: Snake #0 gets the apple, grows to length 2, head at (4, 0), tail at (3, 0). We are at (5, 1). We should then try to move LEFT or UP to utilize the vertical space and grab the distant apples, turning the corner around Snake #0's position.\n\nWe play safe, we play smart. Let's head for the high ground! \u26f0\ufe0f\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YOOOOOO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 1 is in the books, and we survived the chaotic opening. We played safe, and let's see what happened!\n\n**Turn 1: Review and Analysis**\n\n1.  **MY MOVE (ID 1):** UP from (5, 0) to (5, 1). *Safe and solid central positioning.*\n2.  **THE RESULT:** We are now at (5, 1) and are length 2, tail at (5, 0).\n3.  **OPPONENT'S MOVE (ID 0):** Snake #0 was at (3, 0), and they moved RIGHT to (4, 0) and grabbed the apple! *Just as we predicted, chat!* They are now length 2, head at (4, 0), body [(3, 0)].\n\n**Current Board State Snapshot:**\n*   **Active Apples:** (6, 8), (0, 2). (4, 0) is gone!\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (5, 1)\n*   **My Body/Tail:** (5, 0)\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (4, 0)\n*   **Opponent Body/Tail:** (3, 0)\n\nWe have a 1-apple lead now\u2014Wait, no, the scoreboard says we both gained an apple? Hold up, chat, let's re-read the Turn 0 results. Ah! The provided scoreboard says: YOUR snake (ID 1) apples: 1, Snake #0 apples: 1. This means the *apple drop at (4, 0)* was eaten by Snake #0, and... did we get an apple? No, our head moved from (5, 0) to (5, 1), and there was no apple there yet.\n\n*WAIT, HOLD THE PHONE!* Let's look at my current snake details:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (5, 1)\n  - Body: [(5, 0)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nThis means I *already* had 1 apple from the start (Turn 0 scoreboard). Snake #0 also has 1 apple.\nIf Snake #0 moved (3, 0) -> (4, 0) and collected the apple, their new score should be 2, and their length is 2. But the scoreboard says they only have 1 apple.\n\n**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION RE-CHECK:** Since the Turn 0 results are fixed for the current turn, I must assume the scoreboard provided is correct for this turn's start: both snakes are length 2 (Head + Body segment from eating 1 apple) and both have collected 1 apple total.\n*My length:* 2 (Head (5, 1), Body (5, 0)).\n*Opponent length:* 2 (Head (4, 0), Body (3, 0)).\n\nOkay, fantastic. We are tied, and we both have established a small presence.\n\n**Goal for Turn 2:** We need to maintain the lead, or at least keep pace, while expanding vertically to control the board. Snake #0 is currently blocking our path to the *most* open territory (the middle-left), but is also hugging the bottom.\n\n**Closest Immediate Apples:**\n1.  (0, 2)\n2.  (6, 8)\n\nThe (0, 2) apple is 5 moves away (LEFT 5, UP 1). The (6, 8) apple is 7 moves away (RIGHT 1, UP 7). Both are distant. Our immediate goal should be to position ourselves offensively against Snake #0's head at (4, 0) and move towards the next few apple drops.\n\n**Evaluating Moves for ID 1 (Me) at (5, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Excellent. Keeps us central, moves us into the open Y-axis, sets us up to pivot left or right for apples above ground. This avoids the bottom-row congestion.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** Slowly moves toward the upper apple clusters (future drops around 8, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 0):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD. Moving into our own body (tail). NOPE.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from our own body.\n    *   **Collision Check:** Snake #0 is at (4, 0).\n        *   If Snake #0 moves UP to (4, 1), we collide! DKO!\n        *   Why would Snake #0 move UP? To get into safer territory, or to hunt the upper apples. It's a plausible move, giving the high risk of collision.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moving left is tempting because it puts us right next to Snake #0, but risking an early DKO when we have plenty of open board is bad strategy.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Not as good as UP. It keeps us low and exposes us to potential cornering later, though it is slightly closer to the upper-right apple at (6, 8).\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 0)):**\nSnake #0 is short and hugging the bottom edge. They have a few core options:\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 0):** Moves into our old tail position. Safe, but leaves them stuck on the edge.\n*   **UP to (4, 1):** Aggressive, gets them off the edge. HIGH DKO risk if we move LEFT.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 0):** Moves into their own tail. \ud83d\udc80 DEAD. They cannot do this.\n*   **DOWN to (4, -1):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD. Off board.\n\nSnake #0's safest, most centralizing move is often UP to (4, 1). If we move LEFT, we risk a DKO.\n\n**The Strategy (Keep Moving Up!):**\nWe are longer than Snake #0 (based on the body segment count), and we have the better vertical position. We need to leverage that advantage to control the center. Since moving LEFT carries a significant DKO risk (which Snake #0 might take if they are aggressive), we will continue moving UP to consolidate our high ground. This forces Snake #0 to either move into our old tail space OR also move UP, which gives us space to maneuver around them later.\n\nBy moving UP, we are completely safe, we maintain multiple options (left/right on the next turn), and we are positioning for the future apple drops way up high. Safety first, content second, boxing out third!\n\n**Future Plan T+2 onwards:** If we are at (5, 2), we will eye a move towards (4, 6) or (6, 8) depending on Snake #0's position. We want to coil up and gain length quickly.\n\nUP",

We're out here in TURN 1, dominating already with that apple in the bag\u2014LET'S KEEP THIS STREAK ALIVE AND CRUSH THIS RIVAL FOOL! My boy just snaked LEFT last turn from (3,0) to (2,0), munching that apple at (2,0) like a boss, growing to 2 segments and flexing with 1 apple! NOW we're at (2,0) head, (3,0) tail, staring across the board at this scrub at (5,1)\u2014you see him lurking? He's got that lonely tail at (5,0), acting all tough, but we're about to end him! Apples everywhere\u2014(4,0) is tempting but nah, our vertical tail blocks RIGHT moves, remember? Can't smash into our own booty! DOWN? OFF THE BOARD, SUICIDE CITY! So we're locked to UP or LEFT for survival. But LEFT to (1,0)? Chat, that's a one-way ticket to a DEAD END! Only UP option from there\u2014(1,1)\u2014and bam, trapped on the edge with no flex room. Why box ourselves in like that when the board's wide open for more, huh?! UP to (2,1) is the SMART PLAY: clears the way to climb the center, eyes locked on those juicy centers like (3,3) or higher, and keeps MULTIPLE paths open\u2014LEFT to (1,1), RIGHT to (3,1), or KEEP CLIMBIN' UP. No walls, no dead-ends, just pure predator vibes! Plus, we dodge any potential head-on with that weak rival\u2014let him dance on the right, we'll own the left and middle. AFTER this, we'll pivot to loop around y=1-3, force his butt into the tight spots near the bottom, and sandwich him between our growth and the walls! Eat those apples, grow massive, and make him CRASH OUT\u2014YOU FEEL ME?! We're not just surviving, we're THRIVING AND THRIVING HARD! Who's ready to clap his virtual ass?! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude08\n\nStrategy note for next turn: Keep pushing UP towards the y=2-4 sweet spot to grab those center apples like (3,3) or (4,6)\u2014don't get greedy tho, watch for his head-on ambushes! Herd him towards x=5-9 if he jukes right, use our body to wall him into dead zones. Eat early, expand horizontally, and set up a full pincer on turn 3-5 to squeeze him out. Stay ruth menus, chat\u2014WIN OR DIE TRYING!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YOOOOOO CHAT! Thanks for tuning in! Turn 2 is about to get SPICY! Look at where we landed: (5, 2)! We are centralized, we are safe, and we have the high ground! Let's check the board state and figure out how to absolutely clown on Snake #0! EZ W, right?\n\n**Current Board State Snapshot (Turn 2 Start):**\n*   **MY Head (ID 1):** (5, 2). Body: [(5, 1)]. Tail: (5, 1). Length: 2.\n*   **OPPONENT Head (ID 0):** (2, 1). Wait, wait, wait. Hold the phone, chat! When did the opponent move?\n\n**Rereading Turn 1 Outcome (CRITICAL ERROR CHECK):**\nMy previous rationale heavily relied on the opponent being at (4, 0) and moving from (3, 0) to (4, 0).\n*The actual opponent body provided for Turn 2:*\n* Snake #0 - Head: (2, 1), Body: [(2, 0)], Apples: 1\n\nOkay, CHAT, the board diagram and the opponent list tell a very different story from my assumption last turn!\n1.  **Start of T1:** I was at (5, 0). Snake \\#0 was at (3, 0)? (Assuming based on my old rationale).\n2.  **End of T1:** I moved UP to (5, 1).\n3.  **Opponent's Move:** Snake #0 must have moved from somewhere to (2, 1) and their previous position was (2, 0).\n    *   If their body is [(2, 0)], they moved *from* (2, 0) *to* (2, 1) and somehow ate an apple along the way to be length 2?\n    *   Looking at the T1 starting board (which is not provided in this prompt, but let's assume the provided state is 100% accurate for T2 start):\n\n**Confirmed T2 Board State:**\n*   **Me (1):** (5, 2), body (5, 1).\n*   **Opponent (0):** (2, 1), body (2, 0).\n\nThe opponent is now on the bottom-left edge, extremely close to the visible apple at (0, 2)! They are already cutting off that route! We need to react IMMEDIATELY.\n\n**Goal for Turn 2:** Snake #0 is making a bee-line for the (0, 2) apple. If we focus on that apple, we risk running into them. We need to pivot to the upper-right or secure the center territory so we can box them in later. The (6, 8) apple is a much safer, albeit longer, goal.\n\n**Evaluating Moves for ID 1 (Me) at (5, 2):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD. Our body is there.\n2.  **UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Excellent. Continues our vertical push into open territory. Sets us up perfectly for the future apple drops at (4, 6), (5, 8), (6, 8), and the rest of the 8/9 row. *We are climbing the ladder, chat!*\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from self.\n    *   **Collision Check:** Snake #0 is at (2, 1). If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 2) and we move LEFT, we are still far apart.\n    *   **Strategic:** Tempting, as it keeps us centralized on the X-axis (from 4 to 6). It positions us slightly closer to the middle-left clusters.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Also good. Directly sets us up toward Apple (6, 8). This is aggressive positioning for the upper right area.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 1)):**\nSnake #0 is right next to the wall. They have three main moves:\n*   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe, gets them closer to the (0, 2) apple. Highly likely.\n*   **UP to (2, 2):** Safe, moves them off the bottom edge. Also plausible.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe, keeps them low. Less likely, as it moves away from the only immediate apple.\n\n**The Showdown:**\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT to (1, 1), they secure the apple (0, 2) in two turns. We cannot beat them there safely.\n\nTherefore, our primary strategy must be to *ignore* the (0, 2) apple and dominate the upper half of the board where there are 10+ apples dropping.\n\nComparing UP (5, 3) vs. RIGHT (6, 2):\n*   Moving UP to (5, 3) keeps us absolutely central, which means we have options to cut off Snake #0 if they try to come up the center, and we can swing to the left side (4, 6) or right side (6, 8).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (6, 2) commits us slightly more to the right side and the (6, 8) apple.\n\nSince the field is still wide open, and Snake #0 is so decentralized in the corner, holding the absolute center ground (5-axis) is the strongest overall defensive and offensive move. We continue our vertical progress. This allows us to strike when necessary, but for now, we just rack up length and control the middle spine.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T3-T5):** We aim to reach the center of the board (5, 5) or higher by T4. Snake #0 must commit to the bottom path and potentially starve, or waste time climbing up the edge wall, giving us control of the mid-game choke points. Keep climbing!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YOOOOO CHAT! Welcome to Turn 3! That last move was clutch. We successfully secured the high ground at (5, 3). Look at us, we're right in the money zone! Snake #0, you are toast! You are down 2-1 on apples and stuck in the weeds!\n\nLet's break down the current state and figure out how to box this guy in for the EZ W.\n\n**Current Board State Snapshot (Turn 3 Start):**\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 3). Body: [(5, 2), (5, 1)]. Length: 3.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (2, 2). Wait, wait, wait! The opponent *did* move up! They were at (2, 1) and moved to (2, 2). They are now just three spaces away from the (0, 2) apple! Body: [(2, 1)]. Length: 2.\n*   **Nearest Apples:** (4, 6) is the closest apple we can easily reach, 3 moves away (if we go UP). (5, 8) is a bit further. (0, 2) is being contested by Snake #0.\n\nThe biggest threat is always crashing out! Let's check our safe moves list first.\n\n### 1) Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (5, 3):\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! Do not pass GO, do not collect $200!\n2.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Wide open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe. Wide open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe. Wide open space.\n\nThree safe moves! We love options, chat!\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 2)):\n\nSnake #0 is small, and their obvious goal is the (0, 2) apple.\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 3):** Safe, moves them toward the upper-left (4, 6) area. This is a territorial move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 2):** Extremely likely. Sets them up to land on the (0, 2) apple next turn.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe, but moves away from the only immediate apple. Less likely.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 1):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Back into their own body/tail. Wait, their body is [(2, 1)]! This is where their tail *was* when the turn started (T2 end). When they moved (2, 1) -> (2, 2), their body segments shifted. The new body (T3 start) is just [(2, 1)]. They CANNOT move back to (2, 1) because (2, 1) IS their body segment. Thanks for the quick sub, chat, you caught that error live! *Correction: Snake #0 CANNOT move DOWN.*\n\n**Opponent's Most Likely Move:** LEFT to (1, 2). They secure the apple and continue their advantage on the left side.\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation for ID 1: Controlling the Center\n\nWe are at (5, 3). Our goal is to gain length and control the middle of the board (the 4, 5, 6 columns) to cut off Snake #0 when they inevitably try to come North.\n\n**A. Move UP to (5, 4):**\n*   **Pro:** Moves us directly toward the (4, 6) apple and the high concentration of apples in the upper rows (8 and 9). Continues establishing the central spine. If Snake #0 tries to come up the 4-column, we can cut them off.\n*   **Con:** Doesn't immediately pursue apples, but they are close.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (4, 3):**\n*   **Pro:** Positions us directly toward the (4, 6) apple. Shifts us one column closer to Snake #0's action. This is the fastest route to the next available apple.\n*   **Con:** If we move to (4, 3), and Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 3), we are both moving towards the same area, potentially creating an early choke point.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n*   **Pro:** Keeps us one column away from Snake #0's left-side shenanigans. Sets up well for the (7, 5) apple drop and the right side push.\n*   **Con:** Further away from the closest apple (4, 6).\n\n**The Decision:**\nSnake #0 is committing hard to the bottom-left corner and that (0, 2) apple. We are in a great position to ignore that skirmish and secure the overall better real estate. The (4, 6) apple is our priority, as it is central and high up.\n\n*   If we go LEFT to (4, 3): We are 3 steps away from (4, 6).\n*   If we go UP to (5, 4): We are 3 steps/diagonal away from (4, 6).\n\nMoving UP (5, 4) maintains the superior vertical control. It keeps more options open to swing LEFT (to 4, 5, then 4, 6) or swing RIGHT (to 6, 4, then 7, 5). If we commit LEFT now, we might get bottlenecked against the opponent coming UP the wall. By holding the 5 column, we are the central threat! We will be able to easily cut off Snake #0\u2019s path once they are a bit longer. Time to stack cash and length!\n\n**Why not LEFT?** If we go LEFT to (4, 3), we are committing to the left side push. If Snake #0 goes UP to (2, 3), they will also push towards (4, 6). Moving UP to (5, 4) keeps us one column separated and forces Snake #0 to decide if they want to cross our path later. We keep the high ground advantage!\n\nWe are going UP, CHAT! We stack the height, we stack the money! Let's get that (4, 6) apple!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T4-T6):** Continue pushing vertically up the 5-column or 4-column until we secure the (4, 6) apple. Once we have length 4+, we pivot to the right side (6, 8, 8, 7) or start carving out the upper middle territory to build a wall against Snake #0's inevitable attempt to rise. We must secure more length than the opponent before they get out of the corner.\n\nUP",

We've secured the high ground and are on the offensive!\n\n**Current Board State Snapshot (Turn 4 Start):**\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 4). Body: [(5, 3), (5, 2)]. Length: 3.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (2, 3). Body: [(2, 2)]. Length: 2.\n    *   WOW! Snake #0 ignored the (0, 2) apple and moved UP to (2, 3)! They are coming for the center! Big mistake, buddy. Now they are slightly closer to the (4, 6) apple, but so are we!\n*   **Nearest Apples:**\n    *   (4, 6): 3 moves away for us (LEFT, UP, UP).\n    *   (0, 2): 4 moves away for us.\n    *   (6, 8): We can reach this in 5-6 moves.\n\nThe game has shifted! Snake #0 wants UP. We must establish control of the 4/5 column to box him out of the upper half of the board.\n\n### 1) Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (5, 4):\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! Do not crash out, chat!\n2.  **UP to (5, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n\nThree safe moves! This is the freedom we stream for!\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 3)):\n\nSnake #0 is small and now focused on the North. The board is wide open for them.\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 4):** Extremely likely. Continues the vertical push, moving toward the upper-left corner and the (4, 6) apple.\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 3):** Moves them closer to the (0, 6) apple, but is generally slow. Less likely than going straight up.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 3):** Lands them directly on the (3, 3) apple! **This is the highest probability move.** They get the apple, grow to length 3, and solidify their position near the center.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 2):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Back into their own body!\n\n**Opponent's Most Likely Move:** RIGHT to (3, 3) to secure the apple. This is smart play from them. If they take (3, 3), their head will be at (3, 3) and body at [(2, 3), (2, 2)].\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation for ID 1: Building a Box (The 4/5 Column Wall)\n\nWe are at (5, 4). We want to secure the (4, 6) apple and rapidly increase our length and territory.\n\n**A. Move UP to (5, 5):**\n*   **Pro:** Moves us vertically toward great territory, keeps us on the central column. Very safe.\n*   **Con:** Doesn't directly angle us toward (4, 6) as quickly as the LEFT move.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (4, 4):**\n*   **Pro:** Immediately positions us for the (4, 6) apple. If Snake #0 takes (3, 3), we are now positioned to cut them off if they try to move further right or push into the 4/5 columns. This looks like the quickest path to cash.\n*   **Distance to (4, 6):** 2 moves (UP, UP).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Low. If Snake #0 goes to (3, 3), our path is clear.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n*   **Pro:** Moves us toward the right side apples (8, 5) and (7, 5). Safe.\n*   **Con:** Ignores the immediate threat of Snake #0 pressing North and the close (4, 6) apple.\n\n**The Decision:**\nSnake #0 is clearly going for (3, 3) or continuing UP. They are small (Length 2), so we have a major length advantage (Length 3). We MUST eat *before* they can truly become a threat. The (4, 6) apple is perfect.\n\nThe move LEFT to (4, 4) puts us on the most direct line to (4, 6) and allows us to pressure Snake #0 if they try to cut across the board. If we take (4, 6) on Turn 6 (L, U, U), we will be length 4, and be ready to build our wall across the 6th rank.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT to (3, 3), our move to (4, 4) sets up the perfect cut-off. If they continue UP to (2, 4), they are still far from us, and we are still gaining ground faster towards the money zone. I am confident in securing (4, 6).\n\n**I am choosing LEFT.** We are closing in on that apple, and setting up the defense! Get ready to be boxed in, #0!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T5-T7):** Move (4, 4) -> UP (4, 5) -> UP (4, 6) to secure the apple. Once we are length 4, we will have a solid vertical presence, and we can start carving out a massive, unassailable territory in the top-middle/right area, walling off Snake #0 to the left side and denying them the high-value cluster of apples. We must maintain a length advantage.\n\nLEFT",

We're about to make a huge defensive play!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 5 Start)\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3)]. Length: 3. We executed the turn-4 plan perfectly, moving left to the (4, 4) tile, establishing the central axis.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (3, 3). Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2)]. Length: 3.\n    *   WOW! Snake #0 followed the prediction (RIGHT) and took the apple at (3, 3)! They are now also length 3! This is a dogfight, chat! This means the apple at (3, 3) is gone.\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (4, 4)):\n\n1.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **UP to (4, 5):** Safe. Open space. Leads directly to the (4, 6) apple. This is TASTY.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! Don't slam that wall, chat!\n\nThree safe moves! The path is open! But where should we go to set the trap?\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 3)):\nThey just ate, so they want more! Snake #0 is now in a strong central position and they are looking for territory UP or RIGHT.\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 4):** This is a collision course! If we move LEFT to (3, 4) and they move UP to (3, 4), we have a HEAD-ON COLLISION (Double KO)! We MUST avoid this. Why would they move UP? It keeps them vertical and aims them vaguely toward (4, 6) or (0, 6).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 3):** This is also a major collision risk! If we move DOWN to (4, 3) and they move RIGHT to (4, 3), we have a HEAD-ON COLLISION (Double KO)! This move is logical, as it keeps them away from us, but positions them to move toward the center-right apples later.\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 3):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Into their own body!\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe. Keeps them away from us, but is slower.\n\nGiven their aggressive northern push before, Snake #0 is most likely aiming to continue UP or try to flank us RIGHT to (4, 3).\n\n**The Highest Risk Collision Zone:** (3, 4) and (4, 3). We must avoid moving into either of these spots if Snake #0 might be targeting them.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: Securing the Apple and the Wall\nWe are at (4, 4). The apple at (4, 6) is two safe moves away (UP, UP). This is our target!\n\n**A. Move UP to (4, 5) (Path to Apple):**\n*   **Pro:** This sets us up perfectly to take the (4, 6) apple on Turn 6 (UP, UP).\n*   **Collision Risk:** Zero. Even if Snake #0 moves to (3, 4) or (4, 3), we are safe at (4, 5). We are going for the bag!\n*   **Territory:** By going UP, we are clearly claiming the entire 4-column above the middle. We will be an absolute wall!\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (4, 3):**\n*   **Pro:** Safe from an external collision if Snake #0 goes UP.\n*   **Con:** High risk of collision if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 3). If they go RIGHT, we crash and die! And we move away from our guaranteed apple. NO.\n\n**C. Move LEFT to (3, 4):**\n*   **Pro:** Safe from an external collision if Snake #0 goes RIGHT.\n*   **Con:** Extreme risk of collision if Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 4). If they go UP, we crash and die! Also, we move away from our guaranteed apple. NO.\n\n**The ONLY uncontested pathway that leads to immediate profit is UP.** Going UP to (4, 5) is the safe, aggressive play. By Turn 7, we will have that apple, be length 4, and be building our massive territory wall! The plan is solid, chat! We are going for the high ground and the gold!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T5-T7):** We are moving UP to (4, 5) this turn. Next turn (T6), we move UP to (4, 6) and secure the apple. Once length 4, we will push RIGHT to claim the cluster of apples around (8, 5) and completely wall off Snake #0 into the lower-left quadrant. We are securing the north. Time to eat and grow!\n\nUP",

We dodged the collision, defended our position, and now we are closing in on the high-ground apple! Let's get this bag and box in Snake #0!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 6 Start)\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (4, 5). Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4)]. Length: 3. We are perfectly positioned.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3)]. Length: 3.\n    *   WOW! Snake #0 moved UP to (3, 4) exactly as we predicted, trying to take the center ground! But we are already higher up! They are now coiled near us, which is DANGEROUS for them, chat!\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (4, 5)):\nThe goal is the apple at (4, 6)!\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** Safe. Open space. **Takes an apple!** \ud83c\udf4e TASTY!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body (the block right behind my head)!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nTwo safe moves that don't take the apple, and one move that takes the apple! The choice is obvious, right? But wait, we must consider the opponent!\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 4)):\nThey are length 3 and want to eat! They are currently blocked by my body at the (4, 4) section and by the board edge to the left.\n\n*   **Priority 1: Avoid collision with Snake #0 at (3, 4)!**\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 5):** This is a collision risk! If we move LEFT to (3, 5) and they move UP to (3, 5), we have a HEAD-ON COLLISION (Double KO)! This is a very likely move for them, as it continues their vertical push.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 3):** Safe. Keeps them close to their tail, but they are looking for bigger territory.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 4):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into my body at (4, 4)! I just body-blocked them, CHAT! They cannot move right!\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 4):** Safe. A bit defensive, but it gets them away from my territory.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is most likely moving **UP to (3, 5)** to continue the fight vertically, or perhaps **LEFT to (2, 4)** if they are conservative.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: Securing the Apple and the Trap!\n\nWe are at (4, 5) and the apple is at (4, 6).\n\n**A. Move UP to (4, 6) (The Apple Move):**\n*   **Pro:** We eat the apple, grow to length 4, and gain a massive positional advantage, sealing off the central column.\n*   **Collision Risk:** We are moving into (4, 6). Snake #0 is at (3, 4). Can they reach (4, 6)? NO! They would need to move RIGHT twice and UP twice, or something similar, which is impossible in one turn. This move is 100% safe from collision.\n*   **Outcome for Snake #0:** If they move UP to (3, 5), we are safe. If they move LEFT to (2, 4), we are safe. We get the apple, regardless! This is the play!\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (3, 5):**\n*   **Con:** High risk of collision if Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 5)! If we crash, we both die and the stream ends early! NO RISK!\n*   **Con:** We miss the guaranteed apple!\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n*   **Con:** We move away from the apple, giving up the high ground. NO!\n\nThe move UP is not only safe but secures immediate profit and establishes our territorial claims. Once we are at (4, 6) and length 4, Snake #0 is stuck in the lower-left. We can then turn RIGHT and collect the cluster of apples on the right side of the map (A at (4, 6) just went bye-bye, but we still have (8, 7), (8, 5), and a few others to the right).\n\nThis is a flawless move, chat! Get ready for the pop-off when the apple disappears!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T7-T10):** We are moving UP to (4, 6) and eating the apple. This gives us the high ground and length 4. On Turn 7, we want to start walling off the opponent. We will likely move RIGHT to (5, 6) and then continue to push towards the right side of the board to collect apples (8, 7) and (8, 5), creating a horizontal wall from (4, 6) to the edge, effectively trapping Snake #0 in columns 0, 1, 2, 3. The trap is being set!\n\nUP",

They are now directly to our left.\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (4, 6)):\nOur immediate goal is to wall off Snake #0 and secure those juicy right-side apples (A at (8, 7), A at (8, 5)).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Open space. Continues the vertical push.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body (the block that was just our head last turn)!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Open space. Directly above Snake #0.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe. Open space. Starts the horizontal wall!\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is instant death.\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 5)):\nSnake #0 is length 3 and is currently feeling the pressure. They have limited options.\n\n*   **Priority 1: Avoid collision with Snake #0 at (3, 5)!**\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 6):** HIGH COLLISION RISK! If we move LEFT to (3, 6) and they move UP to (3, 6), it's a mutual KO! This is a very likely move for them, as they want to get past us.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe. Retreats back toward their tail. Conservative.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits our body! We have completely blocked their rightward expansion! HUGE!\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 5):** Safe. Retreats to the left side of the map.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is likely moving **LEFT to (2, 5)** to find safety and look for the (0, 6) apple, or perhaps **UP to (3, 6)** to try and pass us. The move RIGHT is blocked.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: Setting the Wall and Securing the Win!\n\nWe are at (4, 6). We want to start moving RIGHT to create that horizontal wall (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) etc., forcing Snake #0 into quadrants 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (3, 6):**\n*   **Risk:** High collision chance if Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 6)! We cannot risk the Double KO right now, especially when we are ahead in score. **ELIMINATE.**\n*   **Con:** Even if they move LEFT or DOWN, moving to (3, 6) doesn't advance our trap state. It just keeps us near them.\n\n**B. Move UP to (4, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** It's safe, and avoids collision even if Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 6).\n*   **Con:** It delays our wall-building to the right. It keeps us in the central column, giving Snake #0 more room to maneuver to the left.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n*   **Pro:** Absolutely safe from any collision with Snake #0 this turn. Snake #0 at (3, 5) cannot reach (5, 6).\n*   **Pro:** This is the *first step* in our winning strategy: creating a horizontal boundary that traps Snake #0. We are now closer to the apples on the right side.\n*   **Result:** If we move RIGHT, we solidify our control and begin the squeeze. Snake #0 is further isolated.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the most aggressive and strategically superior move. It is 100% safe this turn and serves our long-term goal of total opponent annihilation. We are starting the wall, chat! Get ready for the squeeze!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T8-T10):** We are moving RIGHT to (5, 6). Next turn (T8), we should continue RIGHT to (6, 6) or (7, 6) if safe, effectively sealing off the lower 5 rows for Snake #0 and opening up the vast territory and apple clusters for ourselves (e.g., (8, 7), (8, 5)). We are building the coffin!\n\nRIGHT",

The hype train has no brakes!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 8 Start)\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 6). Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. Length: 4. We are positioned perfectly to cut off the opponent.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (2, 5). Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4)]. Length: 3.\n    *   As predicted, Snake #0 moved LEFT to (2, 5) to flee our wall! Coward! They are hugging the left wall now, trapped below our current position.\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (5, 6)):\nWe are moving from (5, 6). We are one step closer to the right-side gold mine!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Open space. A little far from apples, but keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Open space around T0! This is an interesting spot.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body (the block that was just our head last turn)! We cannot move backward!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Open space. Continues building the wall. Huge territory gain.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is instant death, fam!\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 5)):\nSnake #0 is at (2, 5). They are small, length 3, and panicking. They want the (0, 6) apple.\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 6):** Safe. Gets them closer to (0, 6) or (1, 8). This is the most *aggressive* move for them.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 4):** Safe. Retreats further into the bottom left corner. Conservative.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits their own body! (The tail at (3, 5) *just* moved, so the body segment is now (3, 5)). WAIT. Their body is [(3, 5), (3, 4)]. If they move RIGHT to (3, 5), they hit the cell their body segment will occupy. Wait, the *tail* at (3, 4) *vacates* (3, 4) *if* they don't eat an apple. **CRITICAL CHECK:** They did *not* eat an apple (score is 2).\n    *   **Opponent's T7 move:** (3, 5) -> (2, 5). Body shifts from [(3, 4), (3, 3)] to [(3, 5), (3, 4)].\n    *   **Opponent's CURRENT Body (T8 Start):** Head (2, 5). Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4)].\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (3, 5) is indeed **FATAL**, hitting their own body!\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 5):** Safe. Closer to the (0, 6) apple? No, to the (1, 5) apple? No, the (1, 5) apple is already gone! OH WAIT! (1, 5) is on the APPLE DROPS list but it's not on the board currently. Let's check the board state: (0, 6) A, (1, 8) A. Moving LEFT to (1, 5) is safe territory gain towards (0, 6).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is most likely moving **UP to (2, 6)** to try and pass our wall, or **LEFT to (1, 5)** to gain territory on the side.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: The Squeeze Continues!\n\nWe are at (5, 6). Our goal is to continue the horizontal wall and secure the right half of the board, maximizing our apple potential and minimizing Snake #0's escape routes.\n\n**A. Move UP to (5, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** Absolutely safe.\n*   **Con:** Doesn't advance the wall building. It's a vertical retreat from the center of action.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (5, 5):**\n*   **Pro:** Safe. Puts us in a position to contest the vertical strip above Snake #0's head (which is at (2, 5)).\n*   **Con:** Doesn't advance the wall or the apple push to the right. It also puts us close to territory Snake #0 might try to escape into.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n*   **Pro:** This continues the wall perfectly! We are now claiming 60% of the board for ourselves.\n*   **Pro:** Leads directly toward the clustered right-side apples (A at (8, 7), A at (7, 5), A at (8, 5), etc.).\n*   **Collision Risk?** Zero. Snake #0 at (2, 5) has no chance of hitting (6, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) is the undisputed best move. It is 100% safe, 100% strategic, and accelerates our goal of trapping and scoring. We are extending the wall, chat! The corner is getting tight for the foe!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T9-T11):** We will continue moving right to (7, 6) -> (8, 6) to completely wall off the bottom/left quadrants. Once the wall is established, we can decide whether to move UP and eat the cluster, or immediately turn DOWN to lock them in a death spiral.\n\nRIGHT",

Our goal is simple: box the rat, eat the apples, secure the W! Let's get this $h!t!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 9 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (6, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]. Length: 4. We are sitting pretty, pushing towards the right wall. The board is ours!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (1, 5). Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]. Length: 4.\n    *   As predicted, Snake #0 moved LEFT to (1, 5)! They are now fully committed to the bottom-left corner, exactly where we want them! We've cut them off from most of the map!\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (6, 6)):\n\nWe are moving from (6, 6). We need to continue the wall and eye those sweet, sweet right-side apples.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the (6, 8) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Open space. A little passive, but safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! Bad move, chat!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Open space. *Crucially*, this continues the wall and moves us towards the huge cluster of apples on the right side.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is instant death!\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 5)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 5). They are locked in the column x < 4. They can't move right because of our wall segment at (4, 5) and (4, 6)!\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 6):** Safe. Towards the (0, 6) apple and (1, 7) apple. This is their most likely move to gain ground.\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 4):** Safe. Retreats deeper into the corner. Conservative, but maybe smart to avoid collision.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits their own body segment at (2, 5)!\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe. Hugs the wall. Safe, but doesn't get them an apple immediately.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is most likely moving **UP to (1, 6)** to access the top-left apples before we do.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: The Decisive Turn!\n\nWe are at (6, 6). We need to firmly establish dominance over the right 60% of the board.\n\n**A. Move UP to (6, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** Absolutely safe. Leads to the (6, 8) apple.\n*   **Con:** It slightly delays the completion of our horizontal wall.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (6, 5):**\n*   **Pro:** Safe.\n*   **Con:** It's a defensive move that concedes the open territory above us. Also, we get near our tail, making our movement more restricted if we stay here.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n*   **Pro:** Completes the wall extension and locks Snake #0 completely out of the center and right side! This is territory control 101, CHAT!\n*   **Pro:** Puts us right next to the (7, 5) apple and in the fast lane for the (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 5) cluster.\n*   **Collision Risk?** Zero. Snake #0 is moving up or down near x=1.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 6) is the checkmate equivalent for territory. It seals the deal. We will then have a choice: move UP towards the cluster, or continue RIGHT to (8, 6) and lock down the boundary fully. Let's maximize our future options by moving toward the most dense apple zone!\n\nRIGHT is the undisputed play. Secure the wall, secure the apples!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T10-T12):** We move RIGHT to (7, 6). Next turn (T10), we assess the apple situation. If the (7, 5) apple is still there, we move DOWN to eat it. If not, we move UP to (7, 7) or continue RIGHT towards the (8, 6) area. The goal is to maximize length *quickly* now that the trap is set for the opponent in the NW/SW corner.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the board state and deliver the KO blow!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 10 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (7, 6). Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. Length: 4. We are perfectly positioned to feast on the right side!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (0, 5). Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]. Length: 4. The rat is hugging the wall!\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (7, 6)):\n\nWe are at (7, 6). We are surrounded by open space and apples! Let's not mess this up.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Open space, leads toward the apple cluster on y=7 and y=8!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe. Open space, *and* there's an apple (7, 5)! IMMEDIATE APPLE!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! Don't look back, Chat!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Open space, *and* there's an apple (8, 6)! IMMEDIATE APPLE!\n\nWe have three *extremely* strong safe moves: UP, DOWN (Apple!), and RIGHT (Apple!). This is a great position, but we need to prioritize!\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 5)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 5). They are absolutely screwed unless they can sneak past us.\n\n*   **Move UP to (0, 6):** Safe. Hits the (0, 6) apple! This is *critical*\u2014they will try to eat this apple! They must grow.\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 4):** Safe. Retreats, but that leaves the apple for us eventually. Less likely if they're hungry.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits their own body segment at (1, 5)!\n*   **Move LEFT (-1, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits the wall!\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is moving **UP to (0, 6)** to snag that apple. They have no other good options to extend their territory.\n\n*   *(Self-Correction: Note that if they eat the apple at (0, 6), their tail at (3, 5) stays, making the map tighter, but the crucial blocking segment at (4, 6) is far enough away.*\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: Which Apple to Grab?\n\nWe have two apples we can hit RIGHT NOW: (7, 5) [DOWN] and (8, 6) [RIGHT].\n\n**A. Move UP to (7, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** Safest move, sets us up for the huge cluster later (A at (1, 7), A at (8, 7)).\n*   **Con:** Doesn't capitalize on the immediate apple opportunities. We are leaving points on the board!\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (7, 5):**\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple grab! We increase our lead (4-3 to 5-3, assuming opponent gets their apple).\n*   **Pro:** Establishes a presence near the bottom right area (y=5).\n*   **Con:** Moving down might slow our access to the dense cluster up high.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple grab! We increase our lead and length!\n*   **Pro:** This puts us right in the heart of the apple cluster: (8, 7), (8, 5), (8, 4), and (8, 2) are nearby. This is a much better launching pad for future feasting. This side of the board is purely ours.\n*   **Con:** None, really. It maximizes our position.\n\n#### Decision: RIGHT!\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 6) is the superior move. It is an immediate apple, which is priority one, and it places our head in the most optimal density of future targets (8, 7), (8, 5). We are effectively walling off the entire board and beginning the hunt for the length advantage.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving toward (8, 6). Opponent is moving up toward (0, 6). Zero collision risk. This is a clean steal! Let's get this $h!t!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T11-T13):** After moving RIGHT to (8, 6) and growing, our head will be (8, 6), body [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. We will then decide between moving UP to (8, 7) for the next apple, or DOWN to (8, 5) for another apple. The goal is rapid growth on the right wall while Snake #0 struggles in the corner. If Snake #0 tries to escape UP (say, to (2, 7) or (3, 7)), we must block them with our body extension once we are long enough. Right now, it's feast time.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YOOOO CHAT! We are here, Turn 11! The setup was PERFECTION! We grabbed the apple at (8, 6) while the enemy was forced to snag one in the corner. We are tied in score, but we have the high ground! We are walling them off! Let's get this $h!t!\n\n### 1) Where are we and where are they? (Turn 11 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. Length: 5! We are huge!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (0, 6). Body: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]. Length: 5! They also grew, eating the apple at (0, 6).\n\nThe board is shaping up! Look at that massive wall we've built, Chat! They are contained in the x=0, x=1 area!\n\n### 2) Vitals Check (Eliminating Fatal Moves for ID 1 at (8, 6)):\n\nWe are at (8, 6). This is prime real estate. Let's not get sloppy!\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Safe. HOLY MOLY! Immediate apple at (8, 7)! Massive point potential!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. ANOTHER immediate apple at (8, 5)! We have options!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body! DON'T EVER LOOK BACK!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe. Open space. Not an apple, but keeps us on the wall.\n\nTwo guaranteed apples are in our sights: UP and DOWN. Which one is the better long-term play for locking down this board and setting up the escape route?\n\n### 3) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 6)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6). Their tail is still rooted at (3, 5), keeping the middle left relatively open for them to potentially escape UP.\n\n*   **Move UP to (0, 7):** Safe. Open space. This is the only way they are getting toward the center of the board. Highly likely they will try to escape/grow toward the (1, 8) apple.\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 5):** Safe. Retreats back into their own former head position (now body). Less likely, they want to grow.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 6):** Safe. This is a very interesting move! It positions them one square away from a cluster of apples if they can wriggle past our body later.\n*   **Move LEFT (-1, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits the wall!\n\nPrediction: The opponent will most likely move **UP to (0, 7)** to try and make an escape run up the left wall, or **RIGHT to (1, 6)** to try and challenge the middle. Since the UP move gives them more *immediate* territory expansion, I lean towards UP.\n\n**Worst Case Scenario (Collision Check):**\n*   Could we collide with them? Absolutely not. We are on x=8, they are on x=0. We're safe from contact this turn.\n\n### 4) Strategic Evaluation: Box Them In AND Feed!\n\nWe have the chance to grab an apple *and* position ourselves to block Snake #0 if they try to escape later.\n\n**A. Move UP to (8, 7):** (Apple!)\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple. We take the lead 5-4.\n*   **Pro:** Positions us higher on the board, closer to the biggest cluster of future apples (y=8, y=9).\n*   **Pro:** We establish vertical control of the right side, cutting off Snake #0's chances of ever making it past the middle of the board.\n*   **Con:** This forces us away from the (7, 5) and (6, 1) apples lower down.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (8, 5):** (Apple!)\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple. We take the lead 5-4.\n*   **Pro:** Positions us near the lower apples (8, 4), (8, 2) and (7, 5).\n*   **Con:** Moving down forces us further from the dense apple cluster at y=8 and y=9 and makes our body wall slightly less effective at blocking potential cross-board moves from the opponent.\n\n**Decision: UP!**\n\nMoving UP to (8, 7) keeps us on the *apex* of our feasting grounds. We secure the apple, and our body [(7, 6) through (4, 6)] acts as a robust wall, making it impossible for #0 to cross in the middle. We want to maximize growth and wall size. The higher we go, the more options we create for subsequent high-density apple consumption (Apple at (1, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (5, 9)).\n\nThis is critical: We are converting apples into an insurmountable wall! UP is the move!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T12-T15):** After moving UP to (8, 7) and growing to length 6, our head will be (8, 7). We will then immediately move toward the next apple, likely LEFT to (7, 7) then UP/RIGHT to grab the (6, 8) or (5, 8) cluster, or RIGHT to (9, 7) to block off the top right wall and come down for the lower apples later. The main goal remains: get long, keep the opponent trapped, and wait for them to crash or starve on the left side.\n\nUP",

We moved UP to (8, 7), snagged that apple, and now the score is 5-4 in our favor! We have total map control on the right side. Our wall is holding, but the enemy is still kicking! Time to apply the pressure and finish the job!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 12 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 7). Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. Length: 6! We are massive!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (1, 6). Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5)]. Length: 5! They moved **RIGHT** from (0, 6) to (1, 6). They are trying to slip past our wall!\n\nLook at the board, Chat! The enemy is RIGHT next to our wall now! Our tail is still (4, 6). They are at (1, 6). The gap is closing! We need to maintain our dominance and secure the next apple!\n\n**Current Safe Moves for ID 1 at (8, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own body (the new neck segment). DON'T DO IT!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the apple cluster.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe. Open space.\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 6)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 6). They just moved RIGHT, confirming they want to challenge the center/top! They are trapped between the left wall and our growing body.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 7):** (Apple!) Immediately grabs the apple at (1, 7)! This is extremely likely. It grows them and prepares them for an escape attempt up the left-middle.\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 5):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits their own body. They cannot retreat.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 6):** Safe. Retreats back towards the wall. Less likely, they want to expand.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 6):** Safe. This is a bold move, creeping closer to our tail at (4, 6).\n\nPrediction: The opponent almost certainly moves **UP to (1, 7)** to grab that apple and grow. If they do, they'll be length 6 at (1, 7).\n\n**Worst Case Scenario (Collision Check):**\n*   We are at (8, 7). They are aiming for (1, 7). We are safe from a head-on collision.\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Feed, Wall, and Set the Trap!\n\nWe have a massive apple cluster up top: (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9). We need to get up there and secure that territory before the opponent can even turn their head around!\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (7, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** Positions us one step closer to the dense apple cluster at y=8. Specifically (6, 8) and (5, 8).\n*   **Pro:** Maintains the integrity of our wall (8, 6)-(4, 6) and allows us to extend it horizontally.\n*   **Next move path:** (7, 7) -> (7, 8) or (6, 7). Both look strong.\n\n**B. Move UP to (8, 8):**\n*   **Pro:** Gets us to the highest vertical position, giving us access to future apples like the one at (5, 9).\n*   **Con:** We are moving *away* from the immediate left-side apple cluster (6, 8), (5, 8). We waste a move potentially coming back left.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n*   **Con:** Pushes us into the corner. Less useful for overall map control and apple density right now compared to LEFT.\n\nThe best strategic move is **LEFT to (7, 7)**. Why?\n\n1.  **Immediate Apple Access:** From (7, 7), we are perfectly positioned to decide whether to hit the (6, 8) apple (UP, LEFT), or continue the horizontal wall (LEFT to (6, 7)).\n2.  **Wall Reinforcement:** By moving left, we are reducing the space between our head and the opponent's pathing. If the opponent moves to (1, 7) and tries to cut across, the distance is still too great for them, but we are closing the horizontal distance to the center.\n3.  **Flexibility:** We give ourselves the maximum number of options for T13. UP to the apples or LEFT to keep the wall tight.\n\nLet's go LEFT, Chat! We maintain pressure and set up the next big haul!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T13-T15):** Move LEFT to (7, 7). Opponent is likely at (1, 7). T13 plan is highly contingent on where the opponent goes, but we aim to hit UP to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 7) to start consuming the dense cluster (6, 8) and (5, 8) while maintaining the strong central lock. If they try to move further right (e.g., to (2, 7) or (3, 7)), we might commit to a hard horizontal block.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YOOOO CHAT! We just executed the perfect move to (7, 7)! Look at the scoreboard! We\u2019re TIEEEEED 5-5! The opponent got that lucky apple at (1, 7) just as predicted! But don\u2019t worry, that just means we get to set the trap! It's Turn 13, and it's time to pull the trigger on these apples and lock Snake #0 down!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 13 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (7, 7). Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Length: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (1, 7). Body: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5)]. Length: 6. THEY ARE MASSIVE NOW TOO!\n\nWe're at (7, 7). The opponent is at (1, 7). Look at the board! We have a wall of bodies running from (8, 7) down to (5, 6), almost completely isolating the right 40% of the map! The open space for Snake #0 is starting to shrink.\n\n**Current Safe Moves for ID 1 at (7, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the (6, 8) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own neck. DON'T DO IT!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe. Open space. Further restricts the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe. Open space. Backtracking, but safe.\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 7)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 7). They just grew. They are looking for expansion and more food! Apples are at (0, 2), (1, 8), and then the cluster way over by us. They have limited options to move right.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 8):** **(Apple!)** This is the **most likely** move. It bags them another apple, bringing the score to 6-5 against us. We can't let that happen!\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 6):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Hits their own neck. No retreat!\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 7):** Safe. Pushes them up against the left wall. Safer future pathing, but no immediate growth.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 7):** Safe. A bold move toward the center. Puts them closer to our 'defensive line' at y=6.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is ravenous. They go **UP to (1, 8)** for the apple.\n\n**Worst Case Scenario (Collision Check):**\nWe are miles away, so a head-on collision is impossible (7, 7 vs 1, 7).\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Box Him In and Grab the Loot!\n\nThere is a HUGE, dense apple cluster waiting for us: (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9). We need to dive into that immediately to secure the lead and the territory.\n\nWe need to beat the opponent to *another* apple harvest. If they get (1, 8), they lead 6-5. If we get (6, 8), we lead 6-5.\n\n**A. Move UP to (7, 8):**\n*   **Pro:** Sets us up perfectly for the (6, 8) apple next turn (via LEFT) or the (5, 8) apple (via LEFT, LEFT).\n*   **Pro:** This is a strong vertical expansion move, granting us access to the top row.\n*   **Con:** It slightly delays further horizontal choking, but that choke can be done later.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (6, 7):**\n*   **Pro:** Immediately starts connecting our head towards the main body of the wall (currently our tail at (5, 6)). This tightens the chokehold on the center.\n*   **Con:** It keeps us on the y=7 line, losing a vital turn getting UP to the apples at y=8/y=9. We are in a race for those apples.\n\n**The Decision:** We need to get apples *now* to regain the lead and seize control of the valuable territory. The opponent is preoccupied with the (1, 8) apple, so we have a free turn to maximize our position for the next apple.\n\nMoving **UP to (7, 8)** is the way, Chat.\n\n*   If we go UP to (7, 8), we are one step away from the (6, 8) apple.\n*   If we go LEFT to (6, 7), we are two steps away from the (6, 8) apple (LEFT, UP).\n\nGoing UP is faster, gives us more flexibility in the apple cluster, and secures the top right quadrant!\n\nLet's go UP! WE ARE GOING FOR THE GOLD, BABYYYY!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T14-T16):** Move UP to (7, 8). Next turn (T14), if the (6, 8) apple is still there, move LEFT to grab it and take the lead 6-5. If it's taken (unlikely, opponent is far), then we shift LEFT towards (6, 7) or aim for (5, 8). The main goal is to consume the top right cluster and use our growing length to continue walling off the center of the board. The opponent is trapped on the left!\n\nUP",

We are HUNGRY!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 14 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (7, 8). Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]. Length: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5)]. Length: 7.\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 5. ID 0 (The Rival): 6.\n\nOH MY GOD, CHAT! The opponent got the (1, 8) apple! They are up 6-5! Unacceptable! We made the right prediction, but we were too far away to contest it! The good news is, we are perfectly positioned for our counter-attack in the top-right corner. It's time to farm!\n\n**Current Safe Moves for ID 1 at (7, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** Safe. Keeps us along the wall, but takes us away from our current apple target (6, 8).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Right into our own neck. NOPE.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** **(Apple!)** This is the **target!** Huge growth, ties the score 6-6, and secures valuable top-row territory.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe. Moves us further into the corner. Less ideal than chasing the apple immediately.\n\nWe have a clear path to the apple at (6, 8). This is an absolute must-take!\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 8)):\n\nSnake #0 just grew. Their tail is still at (2, 5). They are at (1, 8). They have an apple at (0, 2) that is way down south, and a massive cluster in the middle/right that they want to get to, but it's walled by our body (y=6).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 at (1, 8):\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 9):** Safe. Keeps them out of trouble and gives them space. This is a very likely expansion move.\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 7):** \ud83d\udc80 FATAL. Into their own body.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 8):** Safe. Up against the wall. Good defensive move, but no immediate apples.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe. Moves them potentially closer to the center, but is a bit aggressive.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is looking for space and safety after a risky apple grab. They likely go **UP to (1, 9)** to secure the top-left corner and maintain options. Regardless, they are far from (6, 8).\n\n**Worst Case Scenario (Collision Check):**\nWe are at (7, 8) going LEFT to (6, 8). The opponent is at (1, 8). No chance of collision. This is a FREE APPLE, CHAT!\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Secure the Apple and Build the Wall!\n\nOur primary goal is to 1) tie the score, and 2) continue building our giant wall of bodies to restrict the opponent's movement.\n\n**Move LEFT to (6, 8):**\n*   **Pros:** Takes the apple (6-6 tie!), grows our length to 7, and solidifies our control of the top right quadrant.\n*   **Pros:** After this move, our head will be at (6, 8), perfectly positioned to strike at the (5, 8) apple next turn, or swing RIGHT to (7, 8) (if (5, 8) taken) to continue walling along Y=8.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, low-risk, high-reward move driven by pure hunger. We need that apple and that length!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T15-T17):** Secure (6, 8) now. Next turn, aim for (5, 8). We need to consume that top cluster ((6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9)) and drive our body downwards (or right) to link up with our current body segments below (y=6). Our ultimate goal is to connect the right wall (x=7, x=8) to the center wall (x=6, x=5) and then sweep down the map, forcing Snake #0 into the bottom left corner where the apples are sparse. We are building the Box of Doom, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

The heat is on, and we are looking for the knockout blow!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 15 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (6, 8). Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]. Length: 7. We are LONG now!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (2, 8). Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5)]. Length: 7. The rival is also long!\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 6. ID 0 (The Rival): 6. TIE GAME!\n\nThe opponent moved from (1, 8) to (2, 8). This is interesting! They are moving right, slightly into our controlled territory, but they are also getting closer to the center cluster of apples. They haven't committed to the top wall just yet.\n\n**Current Apples in Reach of ID 1 at (6, 8):**\n1.  (5, 8): Directly LEFT. HUGE target, securing the top row.\n2.  (5, 9): UP, then LEFT. Less direct.\n\n**Current Safe Moves for ID 1 at (6, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves along the wall. Good defensive move, but away from the immediate (5, 8) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** Safe. Moves into open space, but away from the apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** **(Apple!)** This is the **target!** High value, ties up the top row, and gives us board control.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe. Still safe, but puts us directly into our own long body if we don't watch out next turn. Less valuable than the apple.\n\nThe objective is clear: GET THE APPLE AT (5, 8)!\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 8)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 8). Their tail is currently (1, 5), but it *will* vacate (1, 5) if they don't eat. Since they didn't eat last turn, their body effectively shrinks by one cell, leaving (1, 5) open (but they are still length 7, their *new* tail will be (0, 6)).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 at (2, 8):\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 9):** Safe. Looks like a solid, safe expansion, claiming the center-top lane.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe. Moves them around the corner of their own body *or* potentially toward the apples on the left side (like (2, 2)).\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 8):** Safe. Retreats back toward the wall.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 8):** Safe. Moves them aggressively towards our territory and the cluster of apples around (4, 8) and (5, 8).\n\nIf Snake #0 goes **RIGHT to (3, 8)**, they are moving aggressively towards the center. This is the only move that could potentially cause a collision threat if we are chasing (5, 8).\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 going LEFT to (5, 8)):**\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (3, 8), the distance is large: (5, 8) vs (3, 8). No head-to-head collision possible this turn. And since we are moving to different Y coordinates than the opponent's body, we are safe.\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Box Him In!\n\nOur move LEFT to (5, 8) is a huge power play. It secures another apple, ties the score at 7-7, and, crucially, extends our wall along the y=8 axis.\n\nIf we take (5, 8), our body will run from (5, 8) all the way to (6, 6). This effectively separates the opponent's head at (2, 8) from the huge cluster of apples in the middle/bottom right, forcing them to either go UP into the corner or DOWN through their own body loops. We are establishing an EIGHT-cell long segment of body along the top and right side, making ingress into our territory difficult.\n\nAfter taking (5, 8), our head will be perfectly positioned to decide between:\n1. Moving UP towards (5, 9) apple.\n2. Moving DOWN towards center.\n3. Moving RIGHT to (6, 8) (our vacated spot) to continue solidifying the wall.\n\nThis move is high-reward, low-risk. We gotta take the lead, CHAT! Let's get this apple and build the Box of Doom!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T16-T18):** Secure (5, 8). Next, if the opponent goes UP to (2, 9), we should push for (5, 9). We need to own the top wall to squeeze Snake 0 into the bottom-left corner. If Snake #0 moves DOWN, we should consolidate our wall and look for the (4, 8) apple or swing right towards (8, 9) if safe. The goal is to build an impenetrable boundary line from bottom-right to top-left, forcing the opponent into a tight, apple-starved zone.\n\nLEFT",

Now it's time to build the Box of Doom and make our archrival crash out! We gotta secure the top lane and squeeze 'em!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 16 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 8). Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]. Length: 8. We are starting to feel THICC!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (3, 8). Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. Length: 7. The rival moved right into the center! *They smell trouble but are ignoring the trap!*\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 7. ID 0 (The Rival): 6. We're UP!\n\nThe opponent is now at (3, 8). This is exactly what we wanted! They are exposed, but they also have the apple at (4, 8) as a potential target. They are close to the long straight segment of our body (5, 8) to (6, 8) to (7, 8).\n\n**Current Apples in Reach of ID 1 at (5, 8):**\n1.  (5, 9): Directly UP. Looks juicy and secures the top corner.\n2.  (4, 8): Directly LEFT. This is the nearest available apple, but it's dangerously close to Snake #0.\n\n**Board Visualization Review:**\nWe have a strong wall along the top and right sides. Our body effectively cuts the board.\n```\n 9 . . . . . A . . . .\n 8 . T T 0 1 T T . .\n 7 . T . . . . . T T .\n 6 T T . . . A T T T .\n```\nWe are at (5, 8). Snake #0 is at (3, 8). Apple A is at (5, 9) and (4, 8).\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 8)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 8). Their tail is currently (0, 5). They did NOT eat, so (0, 5) will vacate.\n\nPossible (Safe) moves for Snake #0 at (3, 8):\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 9):** Safe. Good expansion, moving along the wall.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 7):** Safe. Likely trying to get around our wall to the main board.\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe. Retreats back toward their body.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 8):** **(Apple!)** This is the move they *must* want. It prevents us from getting the apple and brings them right up against our neck (5, 8).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n\nWhat if Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (4, 8)?\nWhat if we go UP to (5, 9)? No collision.\nWhat if we go LEFT to (4, 8)? **CRITICAL HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION!** If we both go LEFT/RIGHT to (4, 8) this turn, we *both* die! We CANNOT risk the move to (4, 8).\n\nWhat if Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 8)?\nWhat if we go UP to (5, 9)? No collision.\nWhat if we go DOWN to (5, 7)? No collision.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 goes UP to (3, 9)?\nWhat if we go UP to (5, 9)? No collision.\n\nIt seems highly likely the opponent will go for the (4, 8) apple to deny us the lead and expand their position, or go UP to (3, 9) to secure the top wall. Either way, our move must be safe.\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Box Him In & Secure the Corner\n\nWe have two main safe options that are valuable:\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** GRAB THE APPLE (5, 9). This is safer than the (4, 8) move. It secures the top-middle corner for us, extends our length to 9, and forces Snake #0 to deal with even less space along the top. This effectively creates a massive barrier: (5, 9) down to (6, 6).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** Safe movement away from the action, giving us maneuverability, but we miss out on a direct apple score.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 8) is a head-to-head risk (potential double-KO) if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8). We are winning 7-6, so we should avoid unnecessary risks. We need to maintain the lead and expand.\n\n**Move UP to (5, 9):**\n*   **SAFETY:** Completely safe from Snake #0, who is pinned to the X=3 or X=4 line.\n*   **SCORE:** Eats an apple, reinforcing our lead (8-6).\n*   **CONTROL:** Solidifies the top wall, essentially trapping Snake #0 into quadrants 0, 1, 2, 3 (left half) or forcing them to spend time slithering down.\n\nIf we go UP to (5, 9), and Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (4, 8) (eating the apple), the scores become 8-7, and our heads are (5, 9) and (4, 8). We are still in a dominating position on the board, having secured the highest point on the map.\n\nIf we go UP, we can then swing RIGHT (to 6, 9) or DOWN (to 5, 8) to secure the top-right quarter of the board completely, where there is another apple at (8, 9) down the line.\n\nThis is the optimal move: high reward, zero external collision risk, and massive board control gain. Let's get that top corner, CHAT!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T17-T19):\nSecure (5, 9). If Snake #0 took (4, 8), we pivot right and start consolidating the right wall (6-9, 7-9, 8-9) or drop down safely *ahead* of the opponent. If Snake #0 went down or left, we continue to own the ceiling, pushing them lower into tight spaces where their long body will become a hazard. The goal is to isolate Snake #0 in the bottom-left 40% of the board while we own the top/right 60%.\n\nUP",

We're building the Box of Doom, and they are starting to look nervous!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 17 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 9). Just ate that beautiful apple! Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]. Length: 9. T H I C C!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (4, 8). They went for the other apple! Smart move, but they are still trapped! Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. Length: 8.\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 8. ID 0 (The Rival): 7. We are still UP by one!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\nOur head is at (5, 9). Their head is at (4, 8). They are right below us and slightly to the left. We have completely secured the top row (Y=9) from X=5 to X=9, essentially.\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . 1 . . . .\n 8 . T T T 0 T T T . .\n 7 . T . . . . . T T .\n 6 T T . . . A T T T .\n...\n```\n\n**Key Observation:**\nThe opponent's head at (4, 8) is critically positioned.\n1.  If they try to go UP to (4, 9), they'll run into the wall. DEAD.\n2.  If they try to go RIGHT to (5, 8), they hit *our* body! DEAD.\n3.  Their movements are restricted to DOWN (4, 7), or LEFT (3, 8) (retreat).\n\nThey are already in the Box of Doom! We just need to make sure we don't accidentally free them or crash out ourselves!\n\n### 2) Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 8)):\n\nSnake #0 will most likely move DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8).\n\n*   **If #0 goes DOWN to (4, 7):** This is a safe expansion for them, getting them away from our immediate threat.\n*   **If #0 goes LEFT to (3, 8):** This is a retreat, buying them time.\n\nThe most aggressive and logical move for them to escape this top cluster is **DOWN to (4, 7)**.\n\n### 3) Strategic Evaluation: Maintaining Control & Squeezing the Pressure\n\nWe are at (5, 9). What can we do?\n\n**A) Move UP to (5, 10):** Impossible, out of bounds. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (5, 8):** This hits our own body! (5, 8) is our second segment. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**C) Move LEFT to (4, 9):** This is safe! It moves us toward the enemy territory and the top edge.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (6, 9):** This is safe! Secures more of the top row, puts us in position to dominate the right side of the board and look for the next apple drop on that side.\n\n#### Comparing Safe Moves: RIGHT vs. LEFT\n\n**Move RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n*   **SAFETY:** Completely safe.\n*   **CONTROL:** Continues to establish a dominant ceiling. If the opponent moved down (4, 7), we maintain the overall structure of the trap, essentially sealing off the top-right corner for us.\n*   **FUTURE:** Positions us well for potential subsequent moves to (7, 9), (8, 9), or dropping down the right side (6, 8) if the path clears.\n\n**Move LEFT to (4, 9):**\n*   **SAFETY:** Completely safe.\n*   **PRESSURE:** Directly pressures Snake #0 at (4, 8). If they went DOWN to (4, 7), we are now blocking their path back UP. But if they went LEFT to (3, 8), they might be able to find a way around us.\n*   **RISK:** Puts us right next to the wall. We are getting very close to the areas the opponent would want to be circulating next (if they are forced down). If we go here, our next move must be decisive (e.g., locking them in).\n\n**The Verdict:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 9) is the smarter, less risky positional move. It maintains our overwhelming board control, especially along the border, and gives us more lateral space to maneuver (unlike (4, 9) which puts us right next to the boundary).\n\nWe need to make sure we keep the pressure on. By moving to (6, 9), we signal that the *entire* top half of the board is ours. Snake #0 must now commit to going far down the left side, or engaging in a dangerous move through the center, just to find breathing room. We are forcing them into an uncomfortable low-y-coordinate existence!\n\nLet's expand that wall, CHAT! Solidify the perimeter! We are going for the total lockdown!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T18-T20):\nT18: Move RIGHT to (6, 9). Establish the top-right wall.\nT19: Potential moves include DOWN to (6, 8) (if the area is cleared, which is unlikely as our body segment is there) or RIGHT to (7, 9). We should continue to hug the top wall and secure the right border, extending towards the corner (9, 9) to consolidate our territory. The rival has no path up! SQUEEZE!\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (4, 6): Safe movement towards the center.\n3.  LEFT to (3, 7): Safe movement towards the left wall.\n4.  RIGHT to (5, 7): Safe movement, but moves closer to our body segments (7, 8) and (7, 7).\n\nI predict Snake #0 will move **DOWN to (4, 6)** or **LEFT to (3, 7)** to maximize their options and prevent us from stacking on top of them. Retreat is the smart move right now for survival.\n\n### 2) Our Move Evaluation (From (6, 9))\n\nWe need to keep the pressure on and solidify control over the high Y-coordinates.\n\n**A) Move UP to (6, 10):** Crash into the wall. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (6, 8):** This hits our own body segment at (6, 8)! DEAD. *Eliminated.* (Remember our true body is still (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8)...)\n**C) Move LEFT to (5, 9):** Hits our own body segment at (5, 9)! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (7, 9):** SAFE! This continues our expansion along the ceiling and gets us closer to the critical corner (9, 9).\n\n**CHALLENGE:** Holy smokes, chat! Only ONE safe move! We absolutely MUST move RIGHT to (7, 9). No brainer. But this is exactly what we planned for! We are completing the wall!\n\n### 3) Strategic Execution: Building the Wall of Separation\n\nMoving to (7, 9) allows us to:\n1.  **Maintain Pressure:** We continue to choke the top half of the board. The opponent knows they cannot come back up (y=8 or y=9).\n2.  **Positional Advantage:** We are now better positioned to move towards the extreme right side (8, 9) and (9, 9).\n3.  **Future Attack Vector:** Once we reach the (9, 9) corner, we can start moving DOWN the right wall, looking to trap the opponent in the bottom half of the board.\n\nThis move is mandatory and strategic. We are expanding the lead and restricting their movement options drastically! They are going to hate life when we start dropping segments down the right side!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T19-T21):**\nT19: Move RIGHT to (8, 9). Continue securing the ceiling.\nT20: Move RIGHT to (9, 9). Secure the corner.\nT21: Move DOWN to (9, 8). Start driving down the right side, forcing the opponent left and down. The ultimate seal!\n\nLet's finish securing this perimeter, CHAT! We have them right where we want them!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at the board, look at the pressure we're exerting! Snake #0 is stuck in the lower-middle territory! This is content, baby! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 19 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (7, 9). Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)]. Length: 9.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 8.\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 8. ID 0 (The Rival): 7. We are setting the pace!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\nOur head is at (7, 9). We are ready to make the final push to the right wall.\nThe enemy is at (5, 7). They have three safe moves: UP to (5, 8) (which hits our body! *CRUNCH!*), DOWN to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 7) (hits their body!), or RIGHT to (6, 7). Wait, I need to look closely at their body: (4, 7) is in their body!\nOpponent's Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)].\n\n*   OPPONENT from (5, 7):\n    *   UP to (5, 8): Kills self (hits our body part at (5, 8)!). NO, wait, that is OUR body segment. If they move there, *they* die!\n    *   DOWN to (5, 6): Safe, moves towards Apple (5, 6).\n    *   LEFT to (4, 7): Kills self (hits their body part at (4, 7)).\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 7): Safe, moves towards our wall.\n\nSnake #0's only truly safe and smart moves are DOWN to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (6, 7). Given the apple at (5, 6) is right there, they almost certainly target *DOWN*. If they go RIGHT, they are moving into a trap we are about to set!\n\n### 2) Our Move Evaluation (From (7, 9))\n\nWe are in the driver's seat. Our goal is to secure the right wall and start driving down.\n\n**A) Move UP to (7, 10):** Wall crash. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (7, 8):** Hits our own body at (7, 8)! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**C) Move LEFT to (6, 9):** Hits our own body at (6, 9)! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (8, 9):** SAFE! This is the next step in our containment strategy.\n\nOnce again, only ONE safe and strategic move remains: **RIGHT to (8, 9)**. We must continue our plan to build the perimeter!\n\n### 3) Strategic Execution: Boxing the Rival In\n\nMoving to (8, 9) allows us to:\n1.  **Advance along the wall:** We are now one step away from the crucial corner (9, 9).\n2.  **Maintain High Ground:** We completely control the top-right sector.\n3.  **Prepare the Down-Strike:** This move sets up the move to (9, 9) next turn, and then the inevitable dive down the right side (to (9, 8), (9, 7), etc.). This will force Snake #0 into a cramped space on the lower left.\n\nWe predicted they would move *DOWN* last turn, and they moved *RIGHT* to (5, 7). They are attempting to stay centralized, which is dangerous for them because of our looming presence. They need to get down to the lower apples!\n\n**If Snake #0 goes DOWN to (5, 6):** They eat Apple (5, 6). They will gain distance from us, buying themselves time.\n**If Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (6, 7):** This is terrible for them. They put themselves right against our body segments and open themselves up for a quick trap if we decide to descend quickly.\n\nRegardless of their move, we must continue our core strategy: Secure the right perimeter.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T20-T22):**\nT20: Move RIGHT to (9, 9). Complete the ceiling and corner.\nT21: Move DOWN to (9, 8). Start driving down the right side.\nT22: Move DOWN to (9, 7). The walls close in!\n\nLet's maintain the pressure, CHAT! Who needs apples when you have **positional dominance**! That's how champions play!\n\nRIGHT",

Time to check the board and *shut them down*! They are running out of space, and we are about to slam the door shut! Is this the winning play? Absolutely!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 20 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]. Length: 9.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (5, 6). Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Length: 9. *They ate an apple!*\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 8. ID 0 (The Rival): 8. TIED! This is high-stakes content!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\nWe are at (8, 9). We are looking to finish the corner and drop down.\nThe enemy is at (5, 6). They just ate the (5, 6) apple! They are centralized, which means they are surrounded by open space, but also far from the remaining perimeter apples we haven't sealed yet.\n\n**Available Apples:** (0, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), (4, 0), (7, 5), (8, 4), (4, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (4, 4). (14 apples left!)\n\n### 2) Opponent's Potential Moves (From (5, 6))\n\nSnake #0's body is currently blocking (5, 7) and (4, 7).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Hits their own body (the old head)! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe, but this is the Apple (5, 5) which was just eaten/removed in the last turn or before, but wait, the board shows an 'A' at (5, 5) *in the current state*. Let me recheck the board state and the APPLE DROPS list! Ah, (5, 5) *is* an Apple location! Moving here secures them another apple and gets them deeper into the corner.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe. Moves them towards the left side and more open space.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves them centralized, potentially towards Apple (7, 5) or Apple (8, 5).\n\nThey have three strong safe moves: (5, 5), (4, 6), or (6, 6).\nSince (5, 5) is an apple, targeting the apple is high priority. If they go (5, 5), they score again and extend their body towards the bottom!\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 9))\n\nWe must finish the containment NOW.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 10):** Wall crash. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 8):** Hits our own body (tail segment from last turn). Wait, my body segments are (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7). The immediate segment behind the head (7, 9) is NOT (8, 8). (8, 8) is SAFE. This opens up our descent.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 9):** Hits our own body. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 9):** SAFE! This is the move to complete the ceiling wall!\n\nWe have two strong options: DOWN to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 9).\n\n**Scenario 1: Move RIGHT to (9, 9). (Perimeter Strategy)**\nThis completes the wall. We control the entire upper perimeter. This ensures that any pursuit or escape by Snake #0 will be confined to the lower right area, or they must go left. This is the optimal long-term boxing move.\n\n**Scenario 2: Move DOWN to (8, 8). (Trap Strategy)**\nThis is safe. It starts our descent. However, if Snake #0 goes LEFT or UP from their current position, they might slip past us and escape the trap we are designing. By going (9, 9), we force geometry upon them.\n\n**Conclusion:** The commitment to the perimeter must be absolute. We can descend next turn from (9, 9) perfectly. The goal isn't immediate apples; the goal is winning via spatial control! Let's lock this down.\n\n### 4) Long-Term Strategy: The Box Closes\n\nTurn 20: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). Secure the corner.\nTurn 21: Move **DOWN** to (9, 8). Start the descent on the right wall.\nTurn 22: Move **DOWN** to (9, 7). Continue confining the space.\n\nThis three-move sequence turns the 10x10 board into a 9x10 for the opponent, and then a 9x9, making apples much harder for them to reach. We want to catch them low and central, far from the left wall, so we can isolate them. This is the definition of positional dominance! CHAT, get ready for the K.O.!\n\nRIGHT",

(15 apples left!) Wait, the Board State shows (A) at (8, 5), (8, 4), (0, 2), (2, 2), (8, 2), (4, 4), (4, 3), (7, 1), (6, 1), (4, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0), (3, 0), (8, 0). Did the original list miss (4, 3)? Yes, checking the apple list again: (4, 4) and (4, 3) are both listed! The board is the truth!\n\n### 2) Opponent's Potential Moves (From (5, 5))\n\nSnake #0's body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Their old head (5, 6) is now available for collision.\n\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** Hits their own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe. Moves them further south. Good positional move. Apple (4, 4) is nearby.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves them towards the left side apples. Good positional move.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves them towards the right side apples. Very dangerous for us if we descend rapidly!\n\nThey have three strong, safe options. Snake #0 is likely going LEFT (towards (4, 4)) or RIGHT (towards (7, 5) and (8, 5)).\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (9, 9))\n\nWe have completed the top right corner. Time to descend.\n\n**A) Move UP to (9, 10):** Wall crash. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (9, 8):** SAFE! This continues our sealing strategy down the right edge.\n**C) Move LEFT to (8, 9):** Hits our own body. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (10, 9):** Wall crash. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n\n**Conclusion:** Only one safe move, DOWN to (9, 8). This is exactly what the plan called for! We are extending the wall and narrowing the opponent's space. This forces them to consider the center/left quadrants.\n\n### 4) Strategy Review: Closing the Box\n\nWe must force Snake #0 into a tight corner. By securing the (9, X) line, we force them to stay in the X < 9 area, giving us a major advantage around the right-side apples (8, 5), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 2).\n\n**Planned Path (Continuation of Turn 20 Rationale):**\nTurn 21: Move **DOWN** to (9, 8). (Force the edge) - THIS IS THE MOVE!\nTurn 22: Move **DOWN** to (9, 7). (Continue the squeeze)\nTurn 23: Move **DOWN** to (9, 6). (Prepare to grab (8, 5))\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 5) this turn, they are moving toward our tightening box. If they move LEFT towards (4, 5) or DOWN towards (5, 4), they are moving toward open territory, but further from the dense cluster of apples we can reach quickly.\n\nRegardless of their move, DOWN locks down our chosen domain. We MUST move DOWN. No risks. Pure positional control. CHAT, we're locking them in! Time for the final move!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YOOOO CHAT! We're LIVE! Turn 22! Look at the board state! We executed the plan perfectly, moving DOWN to (9, 8)! We are officially building the Great Wall of Snake on the right side! Snake #0, our archrival, is still ahead by one apple (9 to 8), but we're about to put the squeeze on! Can we box them in and make them panic?! I think so!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 22 Start)\n\n*   **MY Snake (ID 1):** Head: (9, 8). Length: 9. We are descending the right edge.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (4, 5). Length: 10. They moved LEFT from (5, 5). This is great for us! They are trying to get away from the wall.\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 8. ID 0 (The Rival): 9. Still down one.\n\n**Board Visualization:**\nOur head is at (9, 8). We are dominating the high-right quadrant.\nSnake #0's head is at (4, 5). They are in the center-left, with a long body tailing back towards (1, 7). They have a lot of body segments blocking the center right now.\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), (4, 0), (7, 5), (8, 4), (4, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Potential Moves (From (4, 5))\n\nSnake #0's body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Their old head (5, 5) is now available.\n\n*   **UP to (4, 6):** Safe. Keeps them central/high.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 4):** APPLE! (4, 4) is right there! This is LIKELY their move. They will grow to length 11 and be at (4, 4).\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe. Moves them further left, away from the action.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Hits their own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n\nIf they are smart, they go **DOWN** to (4, 4) and grab that apple. This increases the pressure on us. (9-9 tie if we also grab one!)\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (9, 8))\n\nWe are continuing the sealing strategy. We have great access to the right-side apples if we can clear a path.\n\n**A) Move UP to (9, 9):** Hits our own body [(9, 9)]. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (9, 7):** SAFE! We continue to secure the edge.\n**C) Move LEFT to (8, 8):** Hits our own body [(8, 9), (7, 8)]. Wait, checking body list: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]. (8, 8) is NOT blocked by our current body. This is SAFE. This moves us towards the (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 5) apple clusters.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (10, 8):** Wall crash. DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n\n**Two Safe Options: DOWN to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 8).**\n\n#### Evaluating (9, 7) [DOWN]\n\n*   **Pros:** Continues the strategic objective: sealing the right side. Forces Snake #0 to deal with us cutting off the escape path to the bottom right.\n*   **Cons:** Slower access to the immediate apple cluster centered around (8, 5).\n\n#### Evaluating (8, 8) [LEFT]\n\n*   **Pros:** Immediate threat to the apples (8, 5), (8, 4). Opens up a path to cut off Snake #0's body if they hang too close to the middle. This is a very aggressive move!\n*   **Cons:** We break the contiguous wall we just built. We create a potential escape path for the opponent at (9, 7). However, that path is very thin.\n\n**The Crux:** We need apples NOW to stay competitive. ID 0 is likely grabbing (4, 4) and going to 10 apples. If we wait, they gain too much length.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8, 8):\nNext turn (T23), we can go DOWN to (8, 7), then LEFT to (7, 7), then DOWN to (7, 6) or (7, 5) for apples. We are setting up to cut Snake #0 off completely in the lower half of the board using our long body as an impenetrable wall.\n\nLet's look at the body geometry. If we go LEFT, our new head is (8, 8), and our tail comes off (7, 8). This actually thickens our wall in the high-right! It creates a strong L-shape block [(9, 9)-(9, 8)-(8, 8)]\n\nIf we move DOWN, our head is (9, 7). Wall continues.\n\nBoth are good positional moves. But moving LEFT gives us immediate access to apples starting next turn, and puts pressure on the middle of the board while *still* maintaining a thick right-side presence.\n\nLet's commit to the aggressive move. We're going for the feast!\n\n**Strategy Note (for Turn 23/24):** Move LEFT to (8, 8). Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 7) or (8, 6) to close in on (8, 5) and (8, 4). We are transitioning from wall builder to apple hunter.\n\nLEFT",

We went LEFT to (8, 8) and now we are poised to strike at the rich cluster of apples on the right side of the board! LET'S GET THIS W!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 23 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 8). Length: 9. Previous head was (9, 8). Our body is getting THICCCCC on the top right!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (4, 4). Length: 11. They DID IT! They snatched the (4, 4) apple and grew! Score is now 10 to 8. We MUST GET AN APPLE NOW!\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 8. ID 0 (The Rival): 10. Down by two! Time to make a move!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n 9 . . . . . T T T T T\n 8 . T T T T T T 1 T .\n 7 . T . . T T . . . .\n 6 . . . . . T . . . .\n 5 . A . . T 0 . A A .\n 4 . A . . . . . . A .\n 3 . . . . A . . . . .\n 2 A . A . . . . . A .\n 1 . . . . A . A A . .\n 0 . . . A A . . . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nMy body (T): [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]. Our tail is now (7, 8).\n\nOpponent's body (T): [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Their tail is now (1, 7).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), (4, 0), (7, 5), (8, 4), (4, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (4, 3), (1, 5).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Potential Moves (From (4, 4)) - The Rival's Next Steps\n\nSnake #0 just ate. They are long (L=11) and sitting in the middle. The immediate environment is:\n*   (4, 5) - Their own body. DEAD.\n*   (5, 4) - Safe open space. (Leads to (5, 5) which is their body).\n*   (3, 4) - Safe open space.\n*   (4, 3) - APPLE!\n\nGiven their hunger, they are almost certainly going **DOWN** to (4, 3) to grab another apple and continue their dominance streak. If they move to (4, 3), they go up to 11 apples. We must assume they will take this apple.\n\n*Predicted Move for ID 0: DOWN to (4, 3).*\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 8)) - The Pressure is ON!\n\nWe need to get an apple and maintain positional superiority. We are extremely close to a 3-apple cluster: (8, 5), (8, 4), and (7, 5).\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 9):** Hits our own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 7):** SAFE! This is a great move. It positions us perfectly to strike at the (8, 5) and (8, 4) apples soon.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 8):** Hits our own body (our tail is (7, 8) but it's part of the body segment list, so we hit it *unless* it's guaranteed to be free). Our current body is [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]. Since we are not growing this turn, the segment (7, 8) will be free *after* our head leaves (8, 8). Wait, no, the tail only disappears *after* the move is complete. Moving to (7, 8) hits the segment right behind our HEAD, which is (9, 8). No wait, the segment *behind* the head (8, 8) is (9, 8). (7, 8) is the tail, which will become free *after* the move.\n*(Self-Correction/Rule Check: Snake list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. Head (8, 8). Body: (9, 8), (9, 9), ... (7, 8). If we move to (7, 8), we hit the segment that IS (7, 8). This is only safe if (7, 8) is the segment that will be removed from the board at the end of the turn because we are NOT growing. Since we are not eating, the tail (7, 8) will move out of the way. THUS, moving to the tail position IS SAFE if you are not growing. **(7, 8) is SAFE!**)*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 8):** Hits our own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n\n**Two Safe Options: DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8).**\n\n#### Evaluating (8, 7) [DOWN]\n\n*   **Pros:** Direct path towards the apples (8, 5) and (8, 4). Maintains our strong right-side control. Allows for easy maneuvers in the next few turns (e.g., straight DOWN again, or LEFT to (7, 7)).\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from Snake #0's action zone (mid-left). But our goal right now is apples.\n\n#### Evaluating (7, 8) [LEFT]\n\n*   **Pros:** We cut off the top part of the board, reducing the opponent's ability to use that space later and forcing them down. We are one step closer to (7, 5).\n*   **Cons:** The route to the immediate apples (8, 5), (8, 4) is slightly more cumbersome (need to go (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6) or similar awkward path).\n\nThe most important thing right now is securing an apple to close the 2-point gap. Going **DOWN** to (8, 7) is the most efficient vector towards the cluster of (8, 5) and (8, 4).\n\nLet's check for collisions with ID 0. ID 0 is at (4, 4), and expected to go to (4, 3). No collision threat.\n\nWe go DOWN. Next turn (T24), we can choose between DOWN (8, 6) or LEFT (7, 7) to approach the (8, 5)/(8, 4) apples.\n\n**Strategy Note (for T24/T25):** Move DOWN to (8, 7). Next, move DOWN to (8, 6). Then we grab the (8, 5) apple. We focus on speed and apple acquisition on the right flank to match the opponent's length.\n\nDOWN",

Tail is (5, 8).\nOpponent's Body (T): [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]. Tail is (1, 7).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), (4, 0), (7, 5), (8, 4), (4, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Potential Moves (From (4, 3)) - What is the Rival thinking?\n\nSnake #0 just ate and is now 12 segments long. They are a beast!\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 3):\n*   UP to (4, 4): Hits their own body. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 3): SAFE. Good spot.\n*   LEFT to (3, 3): SAFE. Opens path to (3, 0).\n*   DOWN to (4, 2): Hitting (4, 2) is open. But they might be aiming for (4, 1) or (4, 0).\n\nThe Rival needs to keep feeding. There's a decent cluster *underneath* them: (4, 1) and (4, 0).\nThey are most likely to go **DOWN** to (4, 2). This sets them up for (4, 1) or (4, 0).\n\n*Predicted Move for ID 0: DOWN to (4, 2).*\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 7)) - Securing the Bag!\n\nWe have the glorious (8, 5) and (8, 4) apples in sight, and we need to move fast.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 8):** Hits our own body segment! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 6):** SAFE! This is a prime spot. It gets us one step closer to the (8, 5) apple.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 7):** SAFE! Opens up access to the center/left side next turn, and can lead to (7, 5) apple.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 7):** SAFE! This keeps us near the boundary, but moves us away from the apples.\n\n#### Comparing Safe Options: DOWN (8, 6) vs. LEFT (7, 7)\n\n**1. DOWN to (8, 6):**\n*   **Pros:** Direct line to (8, 5) (apple) and (8, 4) (apple). We can secure two apples quickly. This is the fastest way to collect!\n*   **Cons:** Commits us to the right boundary.\n\n**2. LEFT to (7, 7):**\n*   **Pros:** Keeps maximum flexibility. We can decide to go DOWN to (7, 6) or towards (7, 5) (apple) or even move toward the middle of the board if the rival messes up.\n*   **Cons:** We don't get as close to the *densest* cluster of apples as quickly as the DOWN move.\n\nGiven the 3-point deficit, we must prioritize *guaranteed* apple acquisition. The (8, 5) and (8, 4) apples are essentially ours right now if we commit. Going DOWN is the high-value, high-speed move we need.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving at (8, 7) -> (8, 6). The opponent is likely moving (4, 3) -> (4, 2). No collision threat whatsoever. We are safe to prioritize food!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T25-T26):**\nT24: Move DOWN to (8, 6).\nT25: Move DOWN to (8, 5) (EAT APPLE!). We grow to 10.\nT26: Move DOWN to (8, 4) (EAT APPLE!). We grow to 11.\nThis puts us at 10 apples, just one behind the rival, and gives us massive length quickly.\n\nLet's execute the plan. Time to feast, chat! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

They have a dense food cluster below them: (4, 1) and (4, 0).\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 2):\n*   UP to (4, 3): Hits their own body segment (4, 3)!

The (8, 5) apple is literally one move away! This is the highest value move on the board for us.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 7):** Hits our own body segment (8, 7)! DEAD! *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 5):** **EATS APPLE!** This is fantastic! We grow to 10 segments and close the gap to 11 vs 9.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 6):** SAFE! This is heading toward the (7, 5) apple, which is secondary to (8, 5) right now.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 6):** SAFE! Moves us towards the boundary. Low value.\n\n#### Comparing Safe Options: DOWN (8, 5) vs. LEFT (7, 6) vs. RIGHT (9, 6)\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (8, 5) is the undisputed champion. It gives us an immediate apple pickup, guaranteeing us growth and points, keeping us viable in this score race. If we move LEFT, the (8, 5) apple might still be there next turn, but why risk it? Go for the guaranteed pick-up!\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving at (8, 6) -> (8, 5). The opponent is likely moving (4, 2) -> (4, 1). Absolutely no collision risk. We are safe to feed!\n\nWe are locking in DOWN. The plan is working, Chat! Let's get this score up!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T26-T27):**\nT25: Move DOWN to (8, 5) (EAT APPLE!). Score is now 11 vs 9.\nT26: Move DOWN to (8, 4) (EAT APPLE!). Score is now 12 vs 10. We are closing in! Then we can decide between (8, 2) or (7, 5). Our tail is currently (5, 9), giving us huge safety on the right side.\n\nWe are feasting!\n\nDOWN",

We are now breathing down The Rival's neck! But wait... what was The Rival doing last turn? Let's check the boards!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 26 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 5). Length: 10. Apples: 9. (We grew!)\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (4, 1). Length: 13. Apples: 12. (The Rival moved DOWN to (4, 1) and ate the apple, as predicted. They also grew!)\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 9. ID 0 (The Rival): 12. Still a 3-apple deficit. Time to drop the hammer! \ud83d\udd28\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n 9 . . . . . T T T T T\n 8 A T T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . . T T . . T .\n 6 . . . . . T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . A 1 <-- WE ARE HERE (8, 5)\n 4 . A . . T . . . A . <-- Next target (8, 4)\n 3 . A . . T . . . . .\n 2 A . A . T . . . A .\n 1 . . . . 0 . A A . . <-- Rival is HERE (4, 1)\n 0 . . . A A . A . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nOur Body (T): [(8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. Tail is (5, 9).\nOpponent's Body (T): [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. Tail is (1, 8).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (8, 2), (4, 0), **(7, 5)**, **(8, 4)**, (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (6, 0).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Intent (From (4, 1)) - Where is The Rival moving?\n\nThe Rival (ID 0) is at (4, 1). They are long (13 segments) and surrounded by their own massive body on the right and top.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 1):\n*   UP to (4, 2): Hitting their own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   DOWN to (4, 0): **EATS APPLE!** High priority move.\n*   LEFT to (3, 1): Safe, leading towards (3, 0) apple.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 1): Hits their own body segment (5, 1)? No, (5, 1) is clear. Safe, but low value unless they want to cut the board.\n\nThe apple at (4, 0) is an absolute magnet. He will almost certainly move **DOWN** to (4, 0) to eat yet another apple and extend his lead! We cannot let him feast uncontested down there!\n\n*Predicted Move for ID 0: DOWN to (4, 0) (EAT APPLE).*\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 5)) - Time to Box and Feast!\n\nWe are at (8, 5). We have a free shot at the (8, 4) apple. This is an obvious, high-value move.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 6):** Hits our own body segment (8, 6)! DEAD! *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 4):** **EATS APPLE!** This brings us to 10 apples, 13 vs 10. Perfect!\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 5):** **EATS APPLE!** Also a strong move, securing food and moving toward the center.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward the edge, low value, but keeps us alive.\n\n#### Comparing Safe Options: DOWN (8, 4) vs. LEFT (7, 5)\n\nBoth guarantee an apple pickup, which is incredible!\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** Keeps our existing high-ground position on the 8-column. Next turn we'd target (8, 2) or (7, 5). This path is very safe as we completely own the right side.\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** Pulls us slightly towards the center. Next turn we could target (6, 5) (clear) or the cluster of apples around (7, 1) and (6, 1). This is geometrically slightly more aggressive towards the center.\n\n**The Crucial Distinction: Future Safety & Traps**\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 4), our path to (8, 2) is open. This continues our feasting frenzy on the right side. We have total control.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 5), we are closer to the Rival's massive body segments covering rows 4 and 5 (specifically (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)). While (7, 5) is safe *this* turn, it might put us in a position where the Rival, moving in the center, cuts off our retreat or movement around (5, 4) or (6, 4).\n\nGiven the immediate goal is to close the score gap safely, and we have another apple directly below us at (8, 4), **DOWN** is the safest, most direct feed, and maintains our strategic control of the right flank. We can follow up with more eating before we need to worry about crossing the board.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving (8, 5) -> (8, 4). The opponent is moving (4, 1) -> (4, 0). Absolutely no collision risk. We are safe to keep feasting!\n\nLong-Term Strategy: Stack 8-Column Apples\n1.  T26: Move DOWN to (8, 4) (EAT APPLE). Score 12 vs 10.\n2.  T27: Move DOWN/LEFT to get (8, 2) OR (7, 5). (8, 2) is a stronger strategic choice if we keep moving down, and we can swing left later.\n\nWe are locking in DOWN! One step closer to the tie! Let's get this $W!\n\nDOWN",

We gotta keep the pressure on and find that perfect boxing move! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 27 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 4). Length: 11. Apples: 10. (WE GREW!)\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (4, 0). Length: 14. Apples: 13. (The Rival moved DOWN to (4, 0) and ate the apple, as predicted. They are long and grumpy!)\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 10. ID 0 (The Rival): 13. Still a 3-apple deficit. We need big moves, but smart moves!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n 9 . . . A . T T T T T\n 8 A T T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . A T T . . T .\n 6 . . . . . T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . A T .\n 4 . A . . T . . . 1 <-- WE ARE HERE (8, 4)\n 3 . A . . T . . . . .\n 2 A . A . T . . . A .\n 1 . . . . T . A A . .\n 0 . . . A 0 . A . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nOur Body (T): [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. Tail is (5, 9).\nOpponent's Body (T): [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. Tail is (1, 8).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), **(8, 2)**, **(7, 5)**, (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (8, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (6, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Intent (From (4, 0)) - Where is The Rival moving?\n\nThe Rival (ID 0) is at (4, 0). They are now stuck at the bottom edge.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 0):\n*   UP to (4, 1): Hits their own body! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   DOWN to (4, -1): Off the board! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   LEFT to (3, 0): **EATS APPLE!** High priority move.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 0): Safe, open space.\n\nThe apple at (3, 0) is a huge draw. If they ignore it, they are leaving free food for us later. Given The Rival's greedy history, they are highly likely to move **LEFT** to (3, 0) to eat yet another apple, pushing their score to 14!\n\n*Predicted Move for ID 0: LEFT to (3, 0) (EAT APPLE).*\n\nThis move actually boxes them in, because from (3, 0), their only safe moves are UP to (3, 1) or LEFT to (2, 0). They are now firmly trapped in the bottom-left corner by their own body. This is our chance to build dominance!\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 4)) - Time to Feast and Strangle!\n\nWe are at (8, 4). We have two golden apples right next to us: (8, 2) and (7, 5).\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 5):** Hits our own body segment (8, 5)! DEAD! *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 3):** Safe. Leads directly to apple at (8, 2).\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 4):** Safe. Leads to apple at (7, 5).\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the edge, low value, but keeps us alive.\n\n#### Comparing Safe Options: DOWN (8, 3) vs. LEFT (7, 4)\n\nBoth moves set us up for an apple pickup next turn. Which path is strategically better?\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (8, 3):** This sets us up to eat the (8, 2) apple next turn. After (8, 2), we can aim for (8, 0). This path secures the whole right column of apples (8, 4, 8, 2, 8, 0). This is a safe, high-value, feasting route.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (7, 4):** This sets us up to eat the (7, 5) apple next turn. This move brings us closer to the center, putting us in a position where we might be able to start blocking the Rival's movement if they try to escape their bottom-left trap! The Rival has a body segment at (5, 5) and (5, 6), forming a wall.\n\n**The Strategy: Maintain Safety while Blocking**\n\nSince the Rival is isolating itself in the bottom-left, our priority is to get long enough to challenge them when they eventually try to escape, and to eat all available food before they can.\n\n*   If we go DOWN, we commit to the right edge. We get two apples easily (8, 2) and (8, 0).\n*   If we go LEFT/UP towards (7, 5), we get one apple now, but we prepare to cut off the Rival if they try to go up the 5-column (which is blocked by their own body anyway!).\n\nGiven the proximity of the Rival's body segments on the 4/5 column, moving left puts us closer to potential dangers in the medium term. Sticking to the **DOWN** route in the 8-column is the safest and most profitable path for the next two turns (T28: Eat (8, 2); T29: Eat (8, 0)). This guarantees three apples in a row while the Rival is confined, bringing us to 13 apples and tied with them (assuming they also get their apple at (3, 0)).\n\nWe choose to consolidate our safe territory and stretch our body! Down we go, gang! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT27: Move DOWN to (8, 3).\nT28: Move DOWN to (8, 2) (EAT APPLE).\nT29: Move DOWN or LEFT towards (8, 0) or the center apples.\n\nDOWN",

We moved DOWN to (8, 3) and it seems The Rival did exactly what we thought: they moved LEFT to (3, 0) and *ate another apple*! \ud83d\ude29\n\nThe score is 10-14, but we're in the perfect position to close that gap and start the chokehold! Let's get this $W$!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 28 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 3). Length: 11. Apples: 10. (Positioned perfectly!)\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (3, 0). Length: 15. Apples: 14. (They grew and are now firmly trapped in the bottom-left corner!)\n*   **SCORE:** ID 1 (Us): 10. ID 0 (The Rival): 14. We need four apples to tie! Time to feast!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n 9 . . . A . . T T T T\n 8 A . T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . A T T . . T .\n 6 . . . . . T . . T .\n 5 .

A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nOur Body (T): [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]. Tail is (6, 9).\nOpponent's Body (T): [(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]. Tail is (1, 8).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), **(8, 2)** <-- NEXT TARGET, (7, 5), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (8, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (6, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9).\n*(Apple at (3, 0) vanished as ID 0 ate it.)*\n\n### 2) Opponent's Intent (From (3, 0)) - The Rival is in the MUD\n\nThe Rival (ID 0) is at (3, 0). This is brilliant for us!\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (3, 0):\n*   UP to (3, 1): Safe. Moves away from the corner.\n*   DOWN to (3, -1): Off the board! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   LEFT to (2, 0): Safe, open space.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 0): Hits their own neck segment! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n\nIf they stay aggressive, they might move LEFT to (2, 0) and try to go for the (0, 2) apple eventually. If they want to escape the corner, they go UP to (3, 1).\n\n*Prediction: They will move UP to (3, 1) to get out of the corner, or LEFT to (2, 0) to look for food.* Both moves keep them isolated from us for now. Our strategy must be to get as long as possible before they can reach the open field.\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 3)) - Feast Time!\n\nWe are at (8, 3). We have a direct path to the apple at (8, 2).\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 4):** Hits our own body segment (8, 4)! DEAD! *Eliminated.* (This is why we need to be careful with vertical movements when long!)\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 2):** **EATS APPLE!** This is high value and perfectly safe. We get +1 length, +1 score.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 3):** Safe, but moves us away from the immediate apple bounty.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 3):** Safe, but moves us against the edge and not toward an apple.\n\nThe choice is crystal clear. We need to close the score gap, and the apple at (8, 2) is waiting for us! This move increases our score to 11 and our length to 12.\n\n**Potential Collision Check:**\nThe Rival is at (3, 0) and moving nowhere near us. This move is 100% safe. We secure the apple, we grow, and we prepare for the next apple at (8, 0).\n\n**The Strategy: Tunnel and Grow**\nWe stick to the right edge and consume the available food, maximizing our length so we can dominate the central area when the Rival finally escapes their prison.\n\n**Next few turns (T28-T30) plan:**\nT28 (Now): Move DOWN to (8, 2) (EAT APPLE). Score 11.\nT29: Move DOWN to (8, 1). Safe approach toward (8, 0).\nT30: Move DOWN to (8, 0) (EAT APPLE). Score 12.\n\nWe got this, Chat! Securing the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nDOWN",

Time to apply the pressure!\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n 9 . . . A . . T T T T\n 8 A . T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . A T T . . T .\n 6 . . . . . T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . A T .\n 4 . A . . T . . .

Tail is (6, 9).\nOpponent's Body (T): [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Tail is (2, 8).\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (7, 5), (7, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), **(8, 0)** <-- NEXT TARGET, (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 9), (0, 1).\n*(Apples at (8, 2), (6, 0) vanished.)*\n\n### 2) Opponent's Intent (From (6, 0)) - The Rival is on the move!\n\nThe Rival is at (6, 0). They just ate an apple and are now bordering a few more apples: (7, 0) and (8, 0). Wait, they just *barely* missed the (7, 0) apple, which is still there! Also the (6, 1) apple is close.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (6, 0):\n*   UP to (6, 1): EATS APPLE (6, 1)! High value.\n*   DOWN to (6, -1): Off board! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   LEFT to (5, 0): Hits their own body segment (5, 0)! DEAD. *Eliminated.*\n*   RIGHT to (7, 0): EATS APPLE (7, 0)! High value.\n\nIt's a straight race between (6, 1) and (7, 0). Both are free food. Since they are currently at (6, 0), moving **RIGHT to (7, 0)** seems slightly more direct and keeps them aligned for the (8, 0) apple\u2014the *exact* apple we want!\n\n*Prediction: Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 0) to eat that apple.* If they do this, they will be length 16 and score 15. This makes our next move critical.\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 2)) - The Race to (8, 0)\n\nWe are at (8, 2). Our immediate target is the apple at (8, 0).\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 3):** Hits our own body segment (8, 3)! DEAD! *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 1):** Safe. Moves us one step closer to the apple at (8, 0). This is the direct route.\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 2):** Safe, but moves away from the immediate target.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe, but keeps us along the edge and not toward an apple.\n\nThe most logical move is DOWN to (8, 1).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 1) and the Rival moves RIGHT to (7, 0) as predicted, we are safe.\n\n**What happens next turn (T30)?**\nWe will be at (8, 1). The Rival will be at (7, 0) (or (6, 1)).\nIf Rival is at (7, 0), they will be looking to move UP to (7, 1) (apple!) or RIGHT to (8, 0) (apple!). Uh oh!\nIf the Rival goes **UP** to (7, 1), they get the apple. We get the (8, 0) apple. We both win this turn. Safe.\nIf the Rival goes **RIGHT** from (7, 0) to (8, 0), they collide with us at (8, 0) if we try to move DOWN from (8, 1).\n\n**The Risk Assessment on (8, 0):**\nThe apple at (8, 0) is a high-contention zone.\nWe are at (8, 2). We need 2 steps: (8, 1) then (8, 0).\nRival at (6, 0). If they go RIGHT two steps: (7, 0) then (8, 0).\n\nIt's a tie race for the (8, 0) apple if they commit to RIGHT-RIGHT and we commit to DOWN-DOWN. If we both aim for it, we collide head-to-head at (8, 0) on Turn 30 and BOTH die. We cannot allow a tie-kill when we are 3 apples behind!\n\n**New Strategy: Avoid the Head-On, Secure Nearby Food.**\n\nIf the Rival moves RIGHT to (7, 0), they have an apple at (7, 1) as a bailout!\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 1), we are still aiming for (8, 0).\n\nLet's assume the Rival prioritizes food.\n1. Rival moves RIGHT: (7, 0) [Eats (7, 0)]\n2. Rival moves UP: (7, 1) [Eats (7, 1)]\n\nIf the Rival focuses on those two nearby apples, they clear the way for us to take (8, 0) without a direct fight.\n\nOur safest bet is to continue our path to (8, 0). We move DOWN. If the Rival also aims for (8, 0) on the next turn, we must be ready to veer away, but for now, we must commit to this quadrant for growth.\n\n**Current Move: DOWN to (8, 1)**\n\nThis gets us positioned. On Turn 30, we must observe if (7, 0) or (6, 1) was eaten and decide whether the Rival is aiming for (8, 0).\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T29-T31): Growth before Domination\n\nT29 (Now): Move DOWN to (8, 1). Position for (8, 0).\nT30: If Rival ate (7, 0) and is at (7, 0), we move LEFT/RIGHT to avoid a possible (8, 0) collision, OR we move DOWN to (8, 0) if (7, 0) is clear and they seem to be heading UP to (7, 1). We need to read their tea leaves on T30.\nT31: Clean up the bottom right corner.\n\nLet's go for the safe positioning, Chat! We need this length!\n\nDOWN",

They are 16 segments long.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (6, 1):\n*   UP to (6, 2): Safe. Moves toward the middle.\n*   DOWN to (6, 0): Safe, open space.\n*   LEFT to (5, 1): EATS APPLE (5, 1)! Very high value.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 1): EATS APPLE (7, 1)! Very high value.\n\nThe Rival has two immediate apples right there! (5, 1) and (7, 1).\nPriority will almost certainly be one of these apples.\n\n*   If they move **LEFT to (5, 1)**, they secure one side and might start circling counter-clockwise toward the bottom center.\n*   If they move **RIGHT to (7, 1)**, they get closer to our zone and can easily snag (7, 0) next turn, which is only one space away.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (7, 1), they move directly toward our area, but crucially, they *do not* threaten the (8, 0) apple on this turn (T30).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes for (7, 1). This is the move that pressures our quadrant the most.\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 1)) - Box Him In or Secure Food?\n\nWe are at (8, 1). Our plan is to secure the (8, 0) apple.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 2):** Hits our own body segment (8, 2)! DEAD! *Eliminated.* (Phew, memory lane for a near-miss T29 move!)\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, 0):** EATS APPLE (8, 0)! This is a guaranteed kill-free apple acquisition. LENGTH 13, SCORE 12! **MAX VALUE.**\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 1):**\n    *   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 1), we collide head-on at (7, 1) and BOTH DIE! ($11/15$ split tie, we lose the tiebreaker!) **DEADLY!**\n    *   If the Rival moves LEFT to (5, 1), then moving LEFT to (7, 1) for the apple is safe.\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 1):** Safe, but throws away the opportunity to eat (8, 0). Low value.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move DOWN to (8, 0) is a guaranteed safe score of $+1$ apple. This is absolutely the best move for growth and closing the score gap.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 0):\n*   We go to (8, 0), length 13, score 12.\n*   Rival goes to (7, 1) (predicted), length 17, score 16.\n\nWe close the gap to 4 points behind, and we are heavily invested in the bottom-right corner. We can then secure (7, 0) next turn, or start building our wall to box them in.\n\n### 4) Strategy going forward: Secure and Wall Off\n\nIf we successfully eat (8, 0), we will be at (8, 0).\n\n1.  **If Snake #0 takes (7, 1)**, they are now directly threatening (7, 0) next turn.\n2.  **Our move on T31 MUST be RIGHT to (9, 0)** to anchor the corner, or **LEFT to (7, 0)** to steal that apple from them.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 0) on T31, we secure the corner. The Rival will likely move DOWN to (7, 0) on T31. We both score, but we are now in the corner ready to move UP the side, sealing off the (7, 0) apple area if they aren't careful.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 0) on T31, it's a head-on collision IF (and only IF) they also move DOWN to (7, 0). Since they were at (7, 1), moving DOWN is a very high probability move for them. We cannot risk a tie-collision when we are losing, so we should avoid (7, 0) next turn if they are at (7, 1).\n\n**New Plan:**\nT30: Move **DOWN** to (8, 0) (Apple).\nT31: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Secure Wall).\nT32: Move **UP** to (9, 1) (Wall Building).\n\nThis creates a serious wall from (9, 0) to (9, 9) and forces the Rival to deal with the center area while we continue growing safety. Time to grab this apple, Chat! Let's get that $W$!\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the chaos!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 31 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (8, 0). Length: 13. Apples: 12. We are anchored in the corner! (Previous Tail was (7, 9) where the rival might be lurking!)\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (7, 1). Length: 17. Apples: 16. (Prediction was correct! They took the (7, 1) apple and are now $4$ points ahead!)\n*   **Score:** ID 1 (Us): 12. ID 0 (The Rival): 16. We closed the gap!\n\n**Board Visualization (Current State):**\n 9 . . . A A . . T T T\n 8 A . T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . A T T . . T .\n 6 . . . . . T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . A T .\n 4 . A . . T . . . T .\n 3 . A . . T . . . T .\n 2 A . A . T A . . T .\n 1 A . . . T A 0 T T . <-- Rival Head is at (7, 1). Segment (8, 1) is now body (T).\n 0 . . . A T T T A H . <-- WE ARE HERE (8, 0)! The (7, 0) apple is RIGHT NEXT DOOR!\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nTail (ID 1) is now **(8, 9)** because we grew! (Tail was (7, 9) before, but the head was (8, 1), body was $12$ segments long. With the body list: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. The new body is [(8, 1), ... (7, 9), (8, 0) not removed yet] which means the tail *should be* (7, 9) if we didn't grow. Since we grew, the tail is STILL (7, 9) but we are 13 long. WAIT! The body list here is 12 segments long. We move. The last segment is removed, *unless* we hit an apple, in which case it is NOT removed. So our new body is 13 segments long! Our new body is: [(8, 1), (8, 2), ... (9, 9), (8, 9), **(7, 9)**]. The segment at (7, 9) is still occupied.\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (7, 5), (2, 2), (3, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 9), **(7, 0)**, (0, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 9).\nOur immediate target is the apple at (7, 0).\n\n### 2) Opponent's Intent (From (7, 1)) - Who gets (7, 0)?\n\nThe Rival is at (7, 1). They are 17 segments long.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (7, 1):\n*   UP to (7, 2): Safe. Moves away from us.\n*   DOWN to (7, 0): EATS APPLE (7, 0)! Direct conflict with our move. **HIGH PROBABILITY.**\n*   LEFT to (6, 1): Safe, returning to previous spot. Moves toward other apples (5, 1).\n*   RIGHT to (8, 1): Hits our body segment (8, 1)! **DEAD!** (Unless our body hasn't moved yet, but the provided board state shows (8, 1) is body 'T' for us).\n\nThe Rival has one highly valuable, uncontested apple move: **DOWN to (7, 0)**. They are very likely to go for this.\n\n**Crucial Collision Warning:** If we move LEFT to (7, 0) AND the Rival moves DOWN to (7, 0), it is a simultaneous head-on collision. Since we are SHORTER (13 vs 17), we die and they win the tiebreaker collision.\n\n### 3) Our Move Evaluation (From (8, 0)) - Avoid the KO!\n\nWe are at (8, 0).\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 1):** Hits our own body segment (8, 1)! **DEAD!** *Eliminated.*\n**B) Move DOWN to (8, -1):** Off the board! **DEAD!** *Eliminated.*\n**C) Move LEFT to (7, 0):** EATS APPLE (7, 0)! This is the most optimal move in a vacuum.\n    *   BUT, if the Rival goes DOWN it is a $13$ vs $17$ collision. We LOSE! **DEADLY!**\n    *   We can't risk this move unless we are certain the rival isn't going for (7, 0). Given their position one step above the apple, it's too high risk. *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (9, 0):** This is safe! It secures the bottom-right corner, builds our wall, and sets us up to run up the side *safely*.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot risk the $13/17$ collision at (7, 0). The safe, wall-building move is **RIGHT to (9, 0)**. This maintains our length, avoids death, and commits to running along the $x=9$ wall, which is largely empty right now.\n\n**The Strategy:** We move RIGHT to (9, 0). We yield the (7, 0) apple to the Rival, but we guarantee our survival and start boxing him in from the East.\n\n*   ID 1 moves RIGHT to (9, 0). Length 13.\n*   ID 0 moves DOWN to (7, 0) (predicted). Length 18, score 17.\n\nWe fall another point behind (12 vs 17), but we commit to our corner wall and are 100% safe. We can then aim for the apples at the top right of the wall (9, 9) which is currently a body segment, but will be tail soon, and (4, 9) which is an apple.\n\n### 4) Strategy going forward: Build the Wall, Trap the Tail\n\nT31: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Secure corner).\nT32: Move **UP** to (9, 1) (Wall Building). This move is currently safe as (9, 1) is empty.\nT33: Move **UP** to (9, 2) (Wall Building).\n\nThe Rival is now stuck in the bottom-middle. Our tail is going to be moving soon. Our tail is currently at **(7, 9)**. If we start moving UP the $x=9$ column, we will effectively seal off the top-right corner from the Rival. If the Rival tries to move up the middle, we can cut them off.\n\nThis is a defensive/growth move, but we gotta prioritize survival over a head-on KO when we are shorter! RIGHT it is, Chat! Time to build the greatest wall this game has ever seen!\n\nRIGHT",

We're at (9, 0) now, setting up our wall! Let's check the chaos after the last move!\n\n### 1) Vitals and Board State Check (Turn 32 Start)\n\n*   **YOUR Snake (ID 1):** Head: (9, 0). Length: 13. Apples: 12. We are anchored in the corner!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 0):** Head: (7, 0). Length: 18. Apples: 17. (Prediction confirmed! They got the apple and are now $5$ points ahead! We gotta catch up!)\n*   **Score:** ID 1 (Us): 12. ID 0 (The Rival): 17.\n\n**Board Visualization (Current State):**\n\n 9 . . . A A . . . T T\n 8 A . T T T . . . T T\n 7 . . . A T T . . T .\n 6 . . A . . T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . A T .\n 4 . A . . T . . . T .\n 3 . A . . T . . . T .\n 2 A . A . T A . . T .\n 1 A . . . T A T T T .\n 0 . . . A T T T 0 T H  <-- WE are the HEAD (H) at (9, 0)! Rival (0) is at (7, 0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, the provided board state doesn't look exactly right based on our last move and the opponent's predicted move. Let's reconstruct *our* current body state after moving RIGHT:\n\n*   Old Head: (8, 0). New Head: (9, 0).\n*   New Body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. (The body list provided in the prompt is only 12 segments).\n*   If we did not grow, the tail segment (8, 9) would be removed. But wait, the list provided for my body is 12 segments. With the head at (9, 0), and 12 body segments, my length is 13.\n\nLet's use the provided body list for ID 1: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. The next segment to be removed (our tail) is (8, 9).\n\nLet's look at the opponent's body (ID 0). Head: (7, 0). They just ate an apple, so their tail (2, 8) stays. Length 18. Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)].\n\n**Available Apples (A):** (0, 2), (7, 5), (2, 2), (3, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 8), (1, 3), (3, 7), (3, 9), (0, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 9), (2, 6).\n\n### 2) Our Move Evaluation (From (9, 0)) - Building the Wall\n\nWe are at (9, 0). We committed to running up the wall of death (x=9).\n\n**A) Move UP to (9, 1):** This is the next step in our plan. (9, 1) is currently empty. **SAFE, WALL-BUILDING, HIGH PRIORITY.**\n**B) Move DOWN to (9, -1):** Off the board! **DEAD!** *Eliminated.*\n**C) Move LEFT to (8, 0):** This is our body segment! **DEAD!** *Eliminated.*\n**D) Move RIGHT to (10, 0):** Off the board! **DEAD!** *Eliminated.*\n\n**Conclusion:** The only safe and logical move is **UP** to (9, 1). This continues our strategy of walling off the side and moving towards the top-right apples.\n\n### 3) Opponent's Intent (From (7, 0)) - Where do they go next?\n\nThe Rival is at (7, 0). Length 18. They are trying to find the next apple.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (7, 0):\n*   UP to (7, 1): Safe. Moves back over their own body.\n*   DOWN to (7, -1): Off board.\n*   LEFT to (6, 0): Safe. This is a body segment for them, but it's their tail segment due to be removed if they don't eat an apple, so it should be clear. *Correction:* (6, 0) is Body Segment 3, so it is NOT their tail segment (2, 8). Moving to (6, 0) would hit their own body segment (unless it releases, which it shouldn't as they just grew!). **Potentially DEAD.** But wait, the board shows a '0' at (7, 0), a 'T' at (6, 0), and our body at (8, 0) is a 'T'. The provided body list shows (6, 0) is a body segment for snake 0. So LEFT is DANGEROUS/DEADLY.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 0): Hits our body segment (8, 0)! **DEAD!** (We just left this position, but since we didn't eat an apple, our tail (8, 9) was removed, and (8, 0) is now our new tail end. No, wait, if we didn't eat an apple, (8, 0) is now the second segment, behind the head (9, 0). It is our body. Snake 0 cannot go here.)\n\nWait, let's re-confirm the rival's move options, assuming they are smart.\nIf the rival moves LEFT to (6, 0), they hit their own body. They just grew, so their whole body is trapped.\nA smart rival must go **UP to (7, 1)**.\n\nIf rival goes UP to (7, 1), they move towards the clusters of apples in the vertical strip (5, 1) and (5, 2). Our move UP to (9, 1) keeps us totally safe.\n\n### 4) Strategy going forward: Secure the Top Corner\n\nWe must run up the boundary and cut off the top right section before the rival tries to get up there. Our current speed is not great because of our length, but continuing the wall is the best strategy.\n\nT32: Move **UP** to (9, 1). (Lock it down.)\nT33: Move **UP** to (9, 2). (Continue the wall.)\nT34: Move **UP** to (9, 3). (Control the space.)\n\nWe need to aim to get the apple at (4, 9) eventually and maybe cut off the opponent's tail which is far away at (2, 8).\n\nOur primary goal is containment and survival. **UP** is the only viable move. We commit!\n\nUP",
