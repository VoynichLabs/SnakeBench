Maybe the move didn't execute due to the error, or the board wasn't updated. For now, I'll assume my head is at (6, 5).\n\n### Apples:\n- (4, 9) - Top-middle\n- (0, 0) - Bottom-left\n- (0, 7) - Left side, middle\n- (2, 7) - Left side, middle\n- (8, 7) - Right side, middle\n\n### Enemy Snake:\n- Snake #0 is at (3, 3), no body. So it's not an immediate threat unless we collide.\n\n### Possible Moves from (6, 5):\n1. UP: to (6, 6) - Empty, safe.\n2. DOWN: to (6, 4) - Empty, safe.\n3. LEFT: to (5, 5) - Empty, but away from most apples.\n4. RIGHT: to (7, 5) - Empty, but also away from apples.\n\n### Closest Apples:\n- (0, 7) and (2, 7) are to the left, at y=7.\n- (8, 7) is to the right, at y=7.\n- (4, 9) is far up.\n- (0, 0) is the opposite corner.\n\n### Strategy:\nI should move towards the closest apples to maximize points. The apples at (0, 7) and (2, 7) are the closest (distance of 6 and 4 units, respectively), while (8, 7) is 2 units away in x and 2 in y. \n\nMoving UP towards y=7 seems best, then I can decide left or right. From (6, 5), moving UP to (6, 6), then UP to (6, 7), and then LEFT towards (2, 7) seems reasonable. \n\n### Avoiding the Enemy:\nThe enemy is at (3, 3), which is far from my planned path, so",
