          "rationale": "<think>So, the user is playing a Snake game. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The user's snake is at (1,0), and there are several apples on the board. The enemy snake is at (2,1). The goal is to collect apples without dying, and have the most points. The user's last move was None, so they haven't moved yet. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best direction to move. The user's snake is at (1,0), which is the second cell on the bottom row. To the left is (0,0), which is empty. To the right is (2,0), which is also empty. Up would take it to (1,1), which is next to the enemy snake at (2,1). Moving up might risk collision if the enemy moves down. Moving left to (0,0) seems safe, but that's a corner and might limit movement. Moving right to (2,0) is also an option. \n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (1,3), which is four steps up from (1,0). Another apple is at (2,5), which is a bit further. The enemy is at (2,1), so going towards that area might lead to a collision. It might be safer to go towards (1,3) without approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, moving up to (1,1) might not be safe because the enemy is at (2,1). So, perhaps the best first move is to go left to (0,0). That way, the snake avoids the enemy and can then plan the next moves towards the apple at (1,3). Alternatively, moving right to (2,0) might also be safe, but then the enemy is at (2,1), which is adjacent, so that could be risky if the enemy moves down.\n\nHmm, but if the enemy is at (2,1), and the user moves to (2,0), the enemy can't move down to (2,0) because that's where the user is. Wait, no, the enemy's next move could potentially block that path, but it's better to avoid being too close. So, moving left to (0,0) might be safer, giving the user more space to maneuver and plan the next steps towards the apple at (1,3).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (2,0) could allow the user to get closer to the apple at (2,5), but that's farther away. The closer apple is at (1,3), so moving towards that seems better.\n\nSo, moving left to (0,0) seems the safest first move. Then, in the next moves, the snake can move up towards (1,3). \n\nBut wait, moving left to (0,0) would mean the snake is at the edge. If the enemy moves left, could that cause a collision? The enemy is at (2,1), so moving left to (1,1) or (0,1) would be possible. But the user is at (0,0), so the enemy can't reach there in one move unless it moves left twice, which isn't possible in one turn. So, it's safe for now.\n\nTherefore, the first move should be LEFT to (0,0). Then, the next move could be UP to (0,1), and so on towards (1,3). Alternatively, from (0,0), the snake could move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but that's near the enemy. So perhaps better to move up from (0,0) to (0,1), then (0,2), etc., but that's taking a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (2,0) is better. From there, the snake can go up to (2,1), but that's where the enemy is. So, that's risky. So, perhaps moving left is safer.\n\nAnother thought: if the snake moves left to (0,0), and then up, it's moving along the edge, which is safe. But the enemy is at (2,1), so as long as the user doesn't approach that area, they should be fine.\n\nSo, the plan is to move LEFT to (0,0), then start moving up towards (1,3). That way, the snake can grow by eating the apple and gain a point, increasing its length and potentially blocking the enemy.\n\nWait, but the enemy is at (2,1). If the user moves to (0,0), the enemy can't reach there in one move. So, it's safe.\n\nAnother consideration: the user's snake is currently at (1,0). If it moves left to (0,0), it can't go further left, but that's the edge. So, the next moves would have to be up or right. But moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is possible, and then the snake can move towards the apple at (1,3).\n\nYes, that seems like a good plan. So, the first move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I need to make my first move in this Snake game. My snake is at (1,0), and there are several apples on the board. The enemy snake is at (2,1). I want to collect an apple to grow and gain points without colliding with the enemy or the walls.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is straight up from my current position. However, moving directly up to (1,1) might be risky because the enemy is at (2,1), right next to that spot. If I move up, the enemy could potentially move down and block my path or even collide with me.\n\nAnother option is to move left to (0,0). This would position me at the bottom-left corner, away from the enemy. From there, I can start moving up along the left edge, which seems safer. This path would eventually lead me towards the apple at (1,3) without immediate danger from the enemy.\n\nMoving right to (2,0) is also a possibility, but that would bring me closer to the enemy's position at (2,1). I don't want to risk a collision, so moving left seems like the safer choice.\n\nSo, my first move will be to the left to (0,0). This gives me space to maneuver and a clear path to the apple at (1,3) without encountering the enemy immediately. In the next moves, I can move up along the left edge and then right towards the apple.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements to avoid any potential collisions in the future. For now, moving left is the best option to ensure my snake's safety and set myself up for collecting the nearby apple.",

Maybe I should move left to (0, 0) first, then start moving up along the left edge to avoid the enemy.

It continues our progress toward the apple at (2,5) and avoids the walls and enemy snake at (1,1).\n\nNext turn strategy:\n- Continue aiming for the apple at (2,5).\n- Keep in the middle of the board to avoid corners.\n- Maintain safe distances from enemy positions.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move UP again.\n\nNext move: UP.",

Apples are at (2, 5), (9, 2), (1, 8), (1, 3), and (6, 2). The user's main goal is to collect apples without colliding with the enemy or walls.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate area around the user's snake. To the left is (0, 0), which is empty. To the right is (2, 0), also empty. Moving up would take me to (1, 1), which is right next to the enemy at (2, 1). That seems risky because if the enemy moves down, we could collide. Moving left to (0, 0) might be safer, but it's a corner, and I don't want to get trapped.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (1, 3). If I move up to (1, 1), I could be heading towards that apple, but again, the enemy is too close. Maybe I should move left to (0, 0) first, then start moving up along the left edge to avoid the enemy. That way, I can work my way up to (1, 3) without being in immediate danger.\n\nOn the other hand, moving right to (2, 0) would bring me closer to the enemy, which isn't ideal. I don't want to risk a collision, so moving left seems like the better option. Once I'm at (0, 0), I can start moving up, and then when I'm a few steps away from the enemy, I can decide whether to continue towards the apple or take a different route.\n\nI also need to keep an eye on the enemy's movements. If the enemy starts moving towards my position, I might need to change my strategy. But for now, moving left to (0, 0) seems like the safest first step.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, after considering the board layout, the position of the enemy, and the locations of the apples, the best move seems to be to head left to (0, 0). This avoids immediate danger from the enemy and sets up a path towards the apple at (1, 3) without being too close to the enemy. Moving left first provides a safer route and avoids potential collisions. Next, I can start moving up along the left edge to approach the apple safely.",
