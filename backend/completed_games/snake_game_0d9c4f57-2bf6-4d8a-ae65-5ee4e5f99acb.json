If I move up, I might be able to collect the apple at (3, 1) or (1, 1) if I manage to move diagonally in the next turn. Moving down would allow me to collect the apple at (5, 4) if it becomes available. Moving left would allow me to collect the apple at (5, 2) if I move diagonally in the next turn. Moving right would allow me to collect the apple at (7, 2) or (8, 2) if I move diagonally in the next turn.\n\nGiven the current position of the enemy snake (Snake #1 at (8, 5)), it's not a threat at the moment as it doesn't have any body parts. However, it's important to keep an eye on it in case it grows or changes position.\n\nConsidering the available apples and the current board state, I decide to move right (to (7, 2)) to collect the apple at (7, 5) and potentially set myself up for collecting another apple in the next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake and try to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
