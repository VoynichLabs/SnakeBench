If I move DOWN to (5, 5), I'd be right next to its head, which is very risky.

It seems to be positioning itself to collect those apples on the left side. There's still no immediate threat to my route or my target apple at (7, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN. I'm only 4 moves away from securing the apple at (7, 0). This remains a guaranteed point since the enemy snake is too far away and focused on the left side apples. After collecting this apple, I should consider my next target - likely the apple at (5, 5) since it will be the closest remaining apple.\n\nDOWN"

I now have 1 point.\n\nCurrent position: (7, 0) - I'm at the bottom edge of the board.\n\nAvailable apples: (0, 1), (5, 5), (3, 6), (9, 6), (9, 8)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at position (2, 7) with a long body. It's on the left side of the board and seems to be moving around that area.\n\nFrom my current position (7, 0), let me evaluate my options:\n- UP to (7, 1) - IMPOSSIBLE! This is where my body segment is\n- DOWN - IMPOSSIBLE! This would be (7, -1) which is outside the board (wall)\n- LEFT to (6, 0) - Safe, moves me toward the center of the board\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) - Safe, moves me toward the right edge\n\nSince I can't go UP or DOWN, I need to choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- Apple at (9, 6) is toward the upper right\n- Apple at (9, 8) is also in the upper right corner\n- Apple at (5, 5) is more centrally located\n- Apple at (3, 6) is toward the upper left but closer to the enemy snake\n- Apple at (0, 1) is in the bottom left corner\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I'll be positioning myself to eventually move up the right side of the board toward the apples at (9, 6) and (9, 8). This seems like a good strategy since the enemy snake is currently focused on the left side of the board.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 0), I'd be moving toward the center, which gives me more options but doesn't commit to a specific apple target.\n\nI think going RIGHT is the better choice - it positions me to target the right-side apples while staying away from the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving right, I'll be at (8, 0). From there, I should start moving UP along the right edge to target either the apple at (9, 6) or potentially (9, 8). I need to be careful not to trap myself in the corner though.\n\nRIGHT"

I have 4 segments total.\n\nAvailable apples: (0, 1), (9, 6), (9, 8), (5, 9), (3, 0)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at position (6, 6) with body at [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6)] - that's 10 segments total.\n\nPerfect! My strategy is working exactly as planned. I'm now at (9, 5) and there's an apple directly above me at (9, 6). \n\nFrom my current position (9, 5), let me evaluate my options:\n- UP to (9, 6) - EXCELLENT! This gets me the apple immediately and I'll grow to 5 segments\n- DOWN to (9, 4) - Safe but moves away from apples\n- LEFT to (8, 5) - IMPOSSIBLE! This is where my body segment is located  \n- RIGHT to (10, 5) - IMPOSSIBLE! This would be outside the board (wall)\n\nThe enemy snake moved from (6, 5) to (6, 6), so it's moving upward as well. It's still a safe distance away from me.\n\nThis is perfect positioning! I can grab the apple at (9, 6), then continue my planned route up the right edge to collect the apple at (9, 8). This keeps me away from the much longer enemy snake while efficiently collecting apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (9, 6), continue UP to (9, 7), then UP again to (9, 8) to collect the second apple on the right edge. After that, I can reassess whether to go for the apple at (5, 9) or consider other options.\n\nUP"

Continue along the top edge if needed\n\nThe other apples are quite far away: (0, 1), (3, 0), (9, 0), and (7, 4). The (7, 4) apple might be accessible later if I can safely navigate there.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (9, 9), assess whether the enemy snake has moved away from the (5, 9) apple area. If safe, start moving LEFT toward that apple. If the enemy snake is still threatening that area, consider alternative routes to other apples or maintain safe positioning.\n\nUP"
