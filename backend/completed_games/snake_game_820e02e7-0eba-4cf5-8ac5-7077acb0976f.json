They're probably gonna dive DOWN to (8,7) for that apple. If we don't grab an apple now, they're ahead. Can't let that happen! Gotta match or beat their score so we can force head-on collisions later when we have the advantage. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT gets us the apple NOW, even if it limits our next move to just DOWN or LEFT. But hey, we can just go DOWN next turn to (3,8) and boom \u2013 we're back in the open with multiple paths. That's the play!\n\nLong-term plan: Snag this apple, then drop down to (3,8) to avoid getting trapped on the top row. From there, we scout the enemy and move to cut off their space while hunting more apples. Stay aggressive, stay alive! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

So a head\u2011on clash is impossible.  \n\n**Why LEFT is the winner:**  \n1. **Score boost** \u2013 we grab an apple, tying the scoreboard but gaining length. \ud83c\udfaf  \n2. **Space control** \u2013 after the move we\u2019ll sit at (7,7) with body at (8,7) & (8,8). We\u2019ll have a clear lane to keep sliding leftward, boxing the map\u2019s right side while the opponent stays stuck up top.  \n3. **Future flexibility** \u2013 from (7,7) we can keep going left, dip down the central column, or climb up the far\u2011right wall if we need to dodge. It\u2019s the most \u201copen\u2011options\u201d choice.  \n\nSo let\u2019s smash that apple and start corralling the rival! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Move:**  \n\nLEFT",

We've both got 1 apple each \u2696\ufe0f.\n\nFirst, check moves:\n\n- **UP**: (3,10) \u274c Off the board! DEATH. Not an option.\n- **DOWN**: (3,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT**: (2,9) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,9) \u274c That's our own body segment! Crashing into ourselves? That's an L.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. We can go DOWN or LEFT.\n\nNow think about the enemy \ud83e\udde0. They're at (8,7). Their possible moves: UP to (8,8) is their own body \u274c, DOWN to (8,6) \u2705, LEFT to (7,7) \u2705 (apple there!), RIGHT to (9,7) \u2705. They'll likely go LEFT for that apple at (7,7) to grow! If they do, they'll be length 3 while we stay length 2 \ud83d\ude2c.\n\nWe need to match or beat their growth! Look at apples near us: (6,9) top-right, (1,9) top-left, (0,3) far left... but we can't reach any in one move. So no immediate apple grab this turn.\n\nBut we gotta think about TRAPPING and SPACE! If we go LEFT to (2,9), we're hugging the left wall\u2014next turn we can only go DOWN or RIGHT? Actually from (2,9), UP off board \u274c, LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT to (3,9) our old head? Wait, that's empty now, so \u2705, DOWN to (2,8) \u2705. So two safe moves next turn. Not terrible.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,8), we're more central: next turn UP back to (3,9) \u2705, DOWN to (3,7) \u2705, LEFT to (2,8) \u2705, RIGHT to (4,8) \u2705. That's FOUR options! More flexibility! That's huge for not getting trapped.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to cut off enemy space while growing. Enemy is on right side, we're on left. Maybe move toward center to control board. If we go DOWN now, we open more paths, maybe next turn we can head toward an apple like (4,6) or (0,3) while keeping an eye on enemy movement. Aggressive but smart! We can't let them get too far ahead in length though\u2026 but we have time.\n\nChat, what do you think? DOWN gives us options, LEFT corners us a bit. Let's stay flexible and keep pressure!\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (3,8), evaluate apples within 2 steps, maybe move toward (4,6) or left toward (0,3). Watch if enemy grows to length 3\u2014if they do, avoid head-on collisions unless we match length. Keep central control!\n\nDOWN",

They have 2 apples, we have 1. They're longer, so head-on collision is BAD for us \u2014 we'd die. Gotta avoid that!\n\nCheck moves:\n\n- **UP**: (3,9) \u2705 Empty now (our old head moved). Safe.\n- **DOWN**: (3,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT**: (2,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe! But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves and the board state.\n\nEnemy head at (7,7), body at (8,7) and (8,8). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (7,8) \u2705 Empty.\n- DOWN to (7,6) \u2705 Empty.\n- LEFT to (6,7) \u2705 Empty (apple at (6,7) though!).\n- RIGHT to (8,7) \u274c Their own body.\n\nThey'll probably go LEFT for the apple at (6,7) to grow to length 4! That would put them at (6,7) next turn.\n\nWe need to avoid moving into where their head might go. If they go LEFT to (6,7), that's far from us \u2014 but if they go UP to (7,8) or DOWN to (7,6), still not overlapping with our possible moves this turn.\n\nBut we also need to think about TRAPPING and FUTURE OPTIONS. Let's evaluate each of our moves:\n\n**UP to (3,9)**: Back to our old spot. Next turn from there, UP off board \u274c, DOWN to (3,8) \u2705, LEFT to (2,9) \u2705, RIGHT to (4,9) \u2705. That's 3 options. Puts us near top wall \u2014 less central.\n\n**DOWN to (3,7)**: More central. Next turn: UP to (3,8) \u2705, DOWN to (3,6) \u2705, LEFT to (2,7) \u2705 (apple there!), RIGHT to (4,7) \u2705. 4 options, plus an apple nearby! This is strong.\n\n**LEFT to (2,8)**: Next turn: UP to (2,9) \u2705, DOWN to (2,7) \u2705 (apple!), LEFT to (1,8) \u2705, RIGHT to (3,8) \u2705. Also 4 options and near that apple at (2,7). Good.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,8)**: Next turn: UP to (4,9) \u2705, DOWN to (4,7) \u2705, LEFT to (3,8) \u2705, RIGHT to (5,8) \u2705. 4 options, but no immediate apple nearby.\n\nWe want to grow to catch up in length! Apples close: (2,7) and (4,6) are two moves away. (0,3) is far. (6,9) is far.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,7), next turn we can go LEFT to (2,7) for the apple! That's a clear growth path. If we go LEFT to (2,8), next turn DOWN to (2,7) also gets the apple. Both set us up for growth.\n\nBut which is safer from enemy collision? Enemy might move toward (6,7) apple. That's far from (2,7) or (3,7). Low risk.\n\nWe also want to control space and not get cornered. LEFT moves us closer to left wall \u2014 still okay. DOWN keeps us more central. I think DOWN gives slightly better central control.\n\nChat, what do you think? Let's take DOWN to (3,7) to set up for that (2,7) apple next turn! That'll tie us at 2 apples each and length 3 vs their length 4 \u2014 still behind but catching up!\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (3,7), move LEFT to (2,7) to eat apple (unless enemy blocks). If enemy is near, maybe go DOWN to (3,6) toward (4,6) apple instead. Keep avoiding head-on until we match length!\n\nDOWN",

So we need to predict where their head *will be* and not go there *this turn* if possible.\n\nIf they go DOWN to (6,6), that's far from us. If they go UP to (6,8), also far. LEFT to (5,7) \u2014 closer but still not overlapping our options.\n\nOur safe cells: (3,6), (2,7), (4,7).

Wait, in Snake, when you eat, you grow immediately \u2014 so after moving to (2,7), our new body will be [(2,7), (3,7), (3,8)]?

That's fine.\n- Risk: Enemy could go LEFT to (5,7) then next turn maybe (4,7) \u2014 still not colliding this turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,7)**:\n- Next turn from (4,7): UP (4,8)\u2705, DOWN (4,6)\u2705 (APPLE!), LEFT (3,7)\u2705, RIGHT (5,7)\u2705. 4 options, apple nearby next turn.\n\nLEFT gives us instant growth, catching up to 2 apples vs their 3. Still behind but better!\n\nBut is it TRAPPY? Going left near wall \u2014 but we have space.\n\nWHAT ABOUT ENEMY COLLISION THIS TURN? Could they move into (2,7) same time we do? Their possible moves: (6,8),(6,6),(5,7). None are (2,7). So no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\nBut what about them moving into our *current* head (3,7)? They can't reach it in one move. So safe.\n\nSO LEFT IS SAFE AND GETS APPLE.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT are safe but no immediate apple.\n\nWE NEED TO GROW TO COMPETE! Let's take the apple!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating apple at (2,7), we'll be length 3 vs their 4. Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (2,6) to stay central, or maybe toward other apples. Avoid moving toward enemy head until we match length. Watch enemy's move this turn to predict their path.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE! AGGRESSIVE GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Wait no, that's one away. Actually (5,7) is free.  \n- DOWN (5,5) \u2013 apple there! He might go for it.  \n- LEFT (4,6) \u2013 safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,6) \u2013 into his own body? Yes! (6,6) is his body segment. So RIGHT is suicide for him. Unlikely.\n\nSo enemy likely moves: DOWN for apple (5,5), LEFT to avoid us, or UP to reposition.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?  \nIf we go RIGHT to (3,6), enemy goes LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 no collision.  \nIf we go LEFT to (1,6), enemy goes DOWN to (5,5) \u2013 no collision.  \nIf we go DOWN to (2,5), enemy goes LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 no collision.\n\nSo all safe from head-on this turn.\n\nBUT CHAT \u2013 LEFT gives us an APPLE NOW! Growth to length 4! That's priority #1! We need to catch up in length to challenge him. Going DOWN or RIGHT delays growth.\n\nLEFT also sets up next turn: from (1,6) we can go DOWN to (1,5) for ANOTHER APPLE \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e or LEFT to (0,6), UP to (1,7) (but that's our old tail? Wait next turn tail moves). Actually after eating apple, our tail stays, so length 4: head (1,6), body [(2,6), (2,7), (3,7)].\n\nNext turn from (1,6) safe moves: DOWN (apple at (1,5)), LEFT (0,6) open, UP (1,7) maybe safe after tail moves? Need to check next turn.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:  \nEat apple at (1,6) now \u2192 then eat apple at (1,5) next turn if possible \u2192 that brings us to length 5, nearly tied with enemy. Then we can be more aggressive, maybe try to cut off his movement or force head-on when lengths equal.\n\nLEFT IS THE PLAY! GROW NOW, DOMINATE LATER! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Length 5.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 5) \u2014 Length 6, one apple ahead of us \ud83d\ude24\n- **Board Check:** We're at (1,5), body behind us: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7)]\n- **Enemy Body:** [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK FROM (1,5):**\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1,6) \u274c That's OUR OWN BODY! Immediate suicide! UP is DEATH.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1,4) \u2705 Open space! No enemy body there. Looks clear.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0,5) \u2705 Edge of board but still on it! No body there.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2,5) \u2705 Open space! No body there.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (4,5). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (4,6) \u274c That's an APPLE at (4,6)! But also... wait, is that safe? No body there. Actually, it's open! They could go for it.\n- DOWN to (4,4) \u274c That's an APPLE at (4,4)! Also open!\n- LEFT to (3,5) \u2705 Open space.\n- RIGHT to (5,5) \u274c That's THEIR OWN BODY! Death.\n\nSo enemy CANNOT go RIGHT. They can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. They're SURROUNDED BY APPLES at (4,6) and (4,4) \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e They'll PROBABLY go for one!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** We gotta think SIMULTANEOUS moves!\n\n- If we go **DOWN** to (1,4) and enemy goes **DOWN** to (4,4) \u2192 No collision.\n- If we go **LEFT** to (0,5) and enemy goes **LEFT** to (3,5) \u2192 No collision.\n- If we go **RIGHT** to (2,5) and enemy goes **UP** to (4,6) \u2192 No collision.\n- **WORST CASE:** If we go **RIGHT** to (2,5) and enemy goes **LEFT** to (3,5) \u2192 Still one cell apart, safe.\n\nBut WAIT... what if enemy goes **LEFT** to (3,5) and we go **RIGHT** to (2,5)? That's fine. What if we BOTH go **LEFT**? We go to (0,5), they go to (3,5). Fine.\n\nActually... NO immediate head-on collision seems possible from our safe squares. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:** We're length 5 vs their 6. We need to CLOSE THE GAP! Apples are at (1,4) if we go DOWN? NO \u2014 check board: (1,4) is empty on the diagram. Apples are at (4,4), (4,6), (5,3), etc. We're on the left side.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN (1,4):** Puts us closer to bottom-left cluster of apples? (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) are down there. Could be a path to farm. But might corner us?\n- **LEFT (0,5):** Puts us on the edge. Limits future moves (only DOWN, UP, maybe RIGHT back). Risky for getting trapped later.\n- **RIGHT (2,5):** Moves us TOWARD the enemy and central apples! (4,4), (4,6), (5,3). This is AGGRESSIVE! We can try to CUT THEM OFF from apples or force a head-on when we're equal length.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move toward center, pressure enemy, steal apples from their path! If we go RIGHT to (2,5), next turn we could go RIGHT again to (3,5) or DOWN to (2,4) etc. That positions us between enemy and apples at (4,4) or (5,3). They might have to avoid us, giving us time to eat and grow!\n\nRIGHT IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY! BOX THEM IN! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nPlan: Moved to (2,5). Enemy likely went for apple at (4,4) or (4,6). We're now closer to central apples. Next turn consider moving further right/down to contest apples or cut off enemy's path. Avoid getting trapped against our own body. Look for head-on opportunity when lengths equal.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

But... is it smart? \ud83e\udd14\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,4) \u274c ENEMY HEAD CURRENTLY THERE! But wait... simultaneous move! If we go RIGHT and enemy moves AWAY, we survive. If enemy stays or moves into us? HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since we're shorter (5 vs 7), we'd LOSE if both die! \ud83d\ude31 RISKY!\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (3,4) has options:\n- UP to (3,5): \u274c Their body at (4,4)?

Can't.\n\nSo enemy's **safe** moves: UP (3,5) and DOWN (3,3). They'll likely go for apples: (4,6) is blocked by their body, (5,3) is close. DOWN (3,3) heads toward (5,3) and (3,1). UP (3,5) heads toward (2,0)? Not really. I think they go DOWN! \ud83d\udcc9\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- If we go **RIGHT (3,4)** and enemy goes **LEFT (2,4)** \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die, they win by apples (6 vs 4). WE LOSE! \ud83d\ude2d\n- If we go **RIGHT (3,4)** and enemy goes **UP (3,5)** \u2192 We survive, they survive. But we're now adjacent heads? Dangerous next turn!\n- If we go **RIGHT (3,4)** and enemy goes **DOWN (3,3)** \u2192 We survive, they survive. But we land on their previous head spot? That's fine.\n\n**SAFE MOVES WITHOUT GAMBLING:** DOWN (2,3) and LEFT (1,4) are SAFE regardless of enemy move! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nWe're SHORTER, so we AVOID head-on risk!

That's our GOLD MINE! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n- **LEFT (1,4):** Puts us closer to column 0 apples? Not really. Next turn we have UP/DOWN/LEFT open from (1,4). Okay.\n- **DOWN (2,3):** Puts us directly on path to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0). Next turn from (2,3) we'll have DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT open (UP is our body at (2,4)? Wait, that's our old head? Actually our body will be [(2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] after move. So UP to (2,4) is our NEW tail? Actually tail is (2,6). So UP to (2,4) is safe! So 3 options. GOOD!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're playing for APPLE ADVANTAGE! Enemy is longer but trapped near top-right? Their body blocks many moves. We go DOWN to (2,3), then next turn head toward (2,0) cluster. AVOID enemy until we have equal or greater length! Once we're longer, we can push for head-on or box them in! \ud83d\udce6 Keep distance, farm safely, let them make a mistake!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN is the SAFE, HIGH-REWARD PATH to APPLE FARMING!

They're LONGER, but are they STRONGER? \ud83d\udc40\n- **OUR BODY:** [(2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)] \u2013 Solid wall to our UP-LEFT.\n- **ENEMY BODY:** [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)] \u2013 They're COILED around (4,4)-(6,6)! That's a TRAP... FOR THEM? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CHECK FROM (2,3):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,4) \u274c OUR OWN BODY! That's our NECK! INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,2) \u2705 OPEN! No bodies, no edge. SAFE ZONE! \ud83d\udfe2\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,3) \u2705 OPEN! Clear! \ud83d\udfe2\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,3) \u2705 OPEN! But... that's CLOSE to enemy territory! \ud83d\udfe1\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVE PREDICTION \u2013 WHERE'S THE ENEMY GOING?**\nEnemy at (3,5) options:\n- UP to (3,6): \u274c Their body at (4,5)? Wait, check: Their body is [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]. So (3,6) is OPEN! But is (3,6) safe? No apples directly, but leads to (4,6) apple? Their body blocks (4,5) and (5,5)... hmm.\n- DOWN to (3,4): \u274c Their OWN body! That's their neck! CAN'T.\n- LEFT to (2,5): \u274c OUR body at (2,5)! That's our segment! If they go LEFT, they DIE hitting us! \ud83d\ude08\n- RIGHT to (4,5): \u274c Their OWN body at (4,5)! CAN'T.\n\nSO ENEMY'S **ONLY SAFE MOVE** IS **UP to (3,6)**! THEY HAVE NO CHOICE! CHAT, THEY'RE TRAPPED BY THEIR OWN COIL! \ud83e\udd2f This is HUGE! They're forced UP! Which means...\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,3), enemy goes UP to (3,6) \u2013 NO COLLISION. Safe.\nIf we go LEFT/DOWN, also safe.\nSo ALL our safe moves are SAFE regardless! BUT... we can PREDICT their path! This is our CHANCE to CUT THEM OFF! \ud83d\udea7\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CLUSTER:** Bottom-left is STACKED! \ud83c\udf4e (0,0), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (3,1). We need to FARM to catch up! But also... we can BOX THEM IN! Enemy forced UP means they're heading toward (3,6), then maybe (3,7), (3,8)... top-right. We can DOMINATE the bottom and MIDDLE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udc47\nWe need to CORNER THEM! If they only have UP moves, they'll eventually hit the top wall at (3,9). Their body is already blocking their right and down! We can slowly expand LEFT and DOWN, eating apples, growing LONGER. Once we're longer, we can move UP and seal their escape! They're in a DEATH SPIRAL! \ud83d\udc80 Our goal: Get to column 0, row 0-3 apples, then swing right and UP to block their left side. Force them into their own body or the wall!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN (2,2):** Puts us closer to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0). Safe, but maybe too passive? Keeps options open.\n- **LEFT (1,3):** Puts us closer to (0,3) and (1,0). Also safe.\n- **RIGHT (3,3):** Puts us NEARER to enemy path? They're at (3,6) after moving. That's 3 spaces away vertically. Could we threaten them next turn? From (3,3), we could go UP to (3,4) \u2013 which is ENEMY BODY now (their old segment), but will it be there next turn? Their tail? Let's check: Their tail is (6,6). They move head to (3,6), body shifts, tail (6,6) might stay or move? Actually, they don't eat apple, so tail (6,6) disappears, new tail is (3,4)? Wait, their body list: head (3,5) moves to (3,6), so new body: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] \u2013 tail is (5,5). So (3,4) becomes a body segment! So (3,4) will be OCCUPIED next turn! So going RIGHT to (3,3) then UP to (3,4) next turn is IMPOSSIBLE (would hit body). So maybe RIGHT is less flexible.\n\n**FLEXIBILITY CHECK:**\nFrom (2,2): UP (2,3) \u2013 our old head? That's empty now. LEFT (1,2), RIGHT (3,2), DOWN (2,1). ALL OPEN! 4 options!\nFrom (1,3): UP (1,4) \u2013 open, DOWN (1,2) \u2013 open, LEFT (0,3) \u2013 apple! RIGHT (2,3) \u2013 open. 4 options!\nFrom (3,3): UP (3,4) \u2013 will be ENEMY BODY next turn (danger!), DOWN (3,2) \u2013 open, LEFT (2,3) \u2013 open, RIGHT (4,3) \u2013 open. But UP is blocked next turn, so only 3 safe *future* options.\n\nSo RIGHT is slightly riskier for future flexibility.\n\n**DECISION TIME:** We want to FARM apples AND maintain maximum mobility! LEFT (1,3) gets us closest to an apple at (0,3) AND keeps all directions open next turn! DOWN (2,2) also good, but apple is farther. LEFT is AGGRESSIVE farming! Let's SECURE that apple next turn and GROW! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:** LEFT to (1,3)! Let's GO GET THAT APPLE AND START THE SQUEEZE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

DOWN gives us NO apple now but keeps ALL doors open for future farming and maneuvering! We're playing the LONG GAME! We need to STAY AGILE to outmaneuver the longer enemy! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\n\n**VERDICT:** DOWN to (1,2)! Secures future flexibility, keeps us safe, and sets up a run on the (1,0), (2,0), (0,0) apple trio next! We'll catch up in apples SOON! Let's PLAY SMART, NOT GREEDY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** From (1,2), target the bottom-left apple cluster. Move toward (1,0) or (0,2) next. Avoid moving up toward enemy until we're longer. Watch enemy head at (3,6); they may move toward apples at (4,6) or (5,9). We need to grow and then cut off their escape routes. Corner them against the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nDOWN",

NO, checking... (6,8) is APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e They'll PROBABLY GO DOWN FOR THAT APPLE! That grows them to 9! We can't let them pull ahead!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,8), and we go... our moves don't intersect. If enemy goes RIGHT? OFF BOARD (7,9) is out! UP? OFF BOARD (6,10)! So only DOWN is safe for them. So NO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN! CLEAR! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**APPLE TARGETS:**\nWe see apples at (4,2), (0,3), (5,3), etc. UP to (3,2) gets us closer to (4,2)! DOWN to (3,0) gets us closer to (5,0) apple but loops back into our body later? RIGHT to (4,1) gets us closer to center and future options.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY CHECK:**\nWe gotta think 2 steps! Our body is long: [(2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)] plus new head at (3,1) after growth? Wait, we just ate apple at (3,1), so our tail stays at (2,3)? Actually, eating apple means we grow, so our tail REMAINS at (2,3) this turn. So our full body is: Head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). That's 8 segments? We started with 7 apples collected, length is 7+? Actually body length = apples + 1? Let's check: we had 7 apples, body length should be 8. Our listed body has 7 segments plus head? Wait list: head (3,1) + body list of 7 = 8 total. YES.\n\n**NEXT TURN OPTIONS FROM EACH MOVE:**\n- **UP to (3,2):** Next from (3,2): UP to (3,3) \u2013 empty? \u2705 DOWN to (3,1) \u2013 our body? \u274c LEFT to (2,2) \u2013 empty? \u2705 RIGHT to (4,2) \u2013 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e So TWO safe moves, one leads to apple!\n- **DOWN to (3,0):** Next from (3,0): UP to (3,1) \u2013 body \u274c, DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT to (2,0) \u2013 body \u274c, RIGHT to (4,0) \u2013 empty \u2705. ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE! RISKY! Gets us trapped!\n- **RIGHT to (4,1):** Next from (4,1): UP to (4,2) \u2013 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e DOWN to (4,0) \u2013 empty \u2705, LEFT to (3,1) \u2013 body \u274c, RIGHT to (5,1) \u2013 empty \u2705. THREE safe moves! ONE LEADS TO APPLE!\n\nRIGHT GIVES US THE MOST OPTIONS AND GETS US CLOSER TO (4,2) APPLE NEXT TURN! UP ALSO GOOD BUT FEWER OPTIONS AFTER? Actually UP gives two safe moves, one apple. RIGHT gives three safe moves, one apple. RIGHT IS BETTER!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to BOX ENEMY IN! Enemy is top-right corner at (6,9). We should CONTROL CENTER and LEFT SIDE. Moving RIGHT to (4,1) then UP to (4,2) to eat that apple puts us at (4,2) next turn, closer to cutting off enemy's escape downward. Enemy will be at (6,8) after eating apple, length 9. We'll be length 9 after eating (4,2)? Actually we'll be 8 now, eat (4,2) next turn -> 9. TIED LENGTH! Then we can force head-on if we have equal length? Actually if equal length, head-on kills both. But we want to AVOID dying. Better to trap them in corner and make them crash into us or themselves!\n\n**AGGRESSIVE GROWTH IS KEY!** RIGHT gives best path to apple next turn and keeps options open! LET'S DO IT!\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** After RIGHT to (4,1), NEXT TURN strongly consider UP to (4,2) to eat that apple and grow to 9, matching enemy length. Then look to move towards (5,3) or (6,5) apples while positioning to block enemy from moving left. Watch enemy head at (6,8) \u2013 they might go LEFT to (5,8) or DOWN to (6,7). We need to cut off their board space! Stay aggressive! \ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

They might go for an apple? Closest apples: (6,5) below, (5,3) far, (4,6) left-up. They might move DOWN toward (6,5) or LEFT toward center. Gotta watch for head-on!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nIf we go UP to (4,2), enemy going LEFT to (5,8) or DOWN to (6,7) or RIGHT to (7,8) \u2013 NO COLLISION. If we go DOWN to (4,0), same.

GOOD!\n\nUP and RIGHT both give THREE safe moves next turn! DOWN only gives TWO! So DOWN is riskier!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We NEED to catch up in apples! UP gets us an apple NOW and keeps options open! After eating (4,2), we're at 8 apples, enemy at 9. Next turn, we can move towards (5,3) or (6,5) apples while positioning to cut off enemy's escape from the top-right corner. Enemy likely moving DOWN or LEFT this turn. If they go DOWN to (6,7), they're closer to (6,5) apple. We might beat them to it if we go UP now, then RIGHT+UP next turns. We gotta be aggressive and control the center!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** After UP to (4,2) and eating apple, we're length 9 (8 apples). Enemy length 10 (9 apples). Next turn, consider moving to (5,2) or (4,3) to keep options open and head toward (5,3) apple. Watch enemy head position \u2013 if they're at (6,7) or (5,8), we need to cut off their leftward movement. Avoid getting trapped in our own body. Stay aggressive, close the apple gap, and look for boxing opportunities! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nUP",

Gotta watch head-on!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (4,3), enemy going LEFT to (5,7) or DOWN to (6,6) or RIGHT to (7,7) \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nIf we go LEFT to (3,2), enemy same \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,2), enemy same \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nCLEAR FOR NOW! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**APPLE TARGETS:**\n- UP to (4,3): NO APPLE.  \n- LEFT to (3,2): APPLE AT (3,2)! \ud83c\udf4e EAT IT! GETS US TO 9 APPLES \u2014 TIED WITH ENEMY!  \n- RIGHT to (5,2): NO APPLE.  \nLEFT IS THE ONLY MOVE THAT EATS AN APPLE THIS TURN! CONTENT! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY CHECK (NEXT TURN OPTIONS):**\n- **UP to (4,3):** From (4,3): UP to (4,4) \u2014 empty? \u2705 DOWN to (4,2) \u2014 body \u274c, LEFT to (3,3) \u2014 empty? \u2705 RIGHT to (5,3) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e BUT WAIT \u2014 (5,3) is an apple! That's good, but moving RIGHT into apple is safe (grow). So UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe? Actually DOWN is body, so THREE safe moves! Good!\n- **LEFT to (3,2):** Eating apple grows us! New body length 10 (9 apples). Head at (3,2), body adds new head, tail stays? After eating, our body: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) \u2014 length 11? Wait we had 8 apples before, length 9. Eating makes 9 apples, length 10. From (3,2): UP to (3,3) \u2014 empty? \u2705 DOWN to (3,1) \u2014 body \u274c, LEFT to (2,2) \u2014 empty? \u2705 RIGHT to (4,2) \u2014 body \u274c. So only UP and LEFT safe \u2014 TWO safe moves! RISKY!\n- **RIGHT to (5,2):** From (5,2): UP to (5,3) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e DOWN to (5,1) \u2014 empty? \u2705 LEFT to (4,2) \u2014 body \u274c, RIGHT to (6,2) \u2014 empty? \u2705 So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe \u2014 THREE safe moves! Good!\n\nLEFT gives only TWO safe moves next turn! UP and RIGHT give THREE! BUT LEFT EATS APPLE NOW AND TIES THE SCORE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to catch up in apples to force head-on wins! Eating (3,2) ties us at 9 apples each. Next turn we'd have fewer safe moves but we can plan to move UP to (3,3) or LEFT to (2,2) to escape tight spot. Enemy likely moving DOWN toward (6,5) apple or LEFT toward center. If we tie apples, we can look for head-on collision when we have equal or higher length! After eating, our length 10, enemy length 10 (they have 9 apples too). Equal length head-on kills both \u2014 but if we have more apples later, we win tiebreaker! Gotta be aggressive!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** After LEFT to (3,2) and eating apple, we're tied 9-9 apples, length 10. Next turn from (3,2) only UP to (3,3) and LEFT to (2,2) are safe. Prefer UP to (3,3) to keep central access, then maybe RIGHT later to chase (5,3) apple. Watch enemy head \u2014 if they go DOWN to (6,6), they're heading toward (6,5) apple. We need to cut off their leftward escape from top-right corner. Stay aggressive, control center, force them into our body or walls! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nLEFT",

They might go DOWN toward apple at (6,4)? Or LEFT toward center? Gotta watch head-on!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (3,4), enemy going anywhere \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nIf we go LEFT to (2,3), enemy going anywhere \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,3), enemy going anywhere \u2014 NO COLLISION.  \nCLEAR FOR NOW! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**APPLE TARGETS:**\n- UP to (3,4): NO APPLE.  \n- LEFT to (2,3): NO APPLE.  \n- RIGHT to (4,3): NO APPLE.  \nNO APPLES IN IMMEDIATE REACH!

UP IS KING FOR FLEXIBILITY! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is longer (10 apples vs our 9). We need to grow and trap him! He's coiled top-right, head at (6,5). We can move UP to (3,4), then maybe UP again to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4) to approach apple at (4,6) or (5,3). Meanwhile, watch enemy \u2014 if he goes DOWN to (6,4) for apple, he'll grow and be near wall. We can try to get above him and push him into the top wall! Since he's longer, a head-on collision would kill us both (tie apples? He has 10, we have 9 \u2014 he'd win!). So AVOID head-on unless we eat an apple first to tie! Instead, use our body to cut off his escape routes! Be aggressive but smart! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** After UP to (3,4), we have four safe moves next turn. Look to move toward apple at (4,6) or (5,3) while positioning to block enemy's path to center. If enemy moves DOWN to (6,4), consider moving RIGHT then UP to get above him. If he moves LEFT to (5,5), maybe go UP then RIGHT to threaten. Keep options open, don't get trapped near our own tail! We need one apple to tie score, then we can force head-on if advantageous! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Apple at (5,3) \u2014 two moves away via RIGHT then DOWN from (4,4). Apple at (0,3) \u2014 far left, risky near tail. Apple at (9,4) \u2014 far right, near enemy. Best bet: go for (4,6) or (5,3). Enemy head at (7,5) might go for (8,4) apple or (8,5) apple. If he goes DOWN, he grows and gets more dangerous. We should cut off his access to center. After UP to (3,5), we can go RIGHT to (4,5) next turn, threatening apple at (4,6) and positioning above him if he's at (7,4). After LEFT to (2,4), we go toward left apples but away from enemy. After RIGHT to (4,4), we're closer to (5,3) apple. I think UP positions us best to pressure enemy from above while heading toward (4,6). LET'S GO UP!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** After UP to (3,5), next turn consider RIGHT to (4,5) to approach apple (4,6) and potentially block enemy's upward movement. If enemy moves DOWN to (7,4), we can try to get above him and push him into top wall. If he moves UP to (7,6), he's going toward top-right corner \u2014 we can maybe trap him there later. Avoid head-on until we tie apples! Keep options open! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

THREE SAFE MOVES. They'll likely go RIGHT for that apple at (9,4) and GROW AGAIN! WE CAN'T LET THE GAP WIDEN! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,5) and he goes LEFT to (7,4)? NO COLLISION.\n- If we go UP to (4,6) and he goes... anywhere?

NO HEAD-ON THIS TURN! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & STRATEGY CHECK:**\n\n1. **UP to (4,6) \u2013 GRAB THAT APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n   - We GROW to length 10! Score 10-12 (or 10-13 if he eats).\n   - From (4,6): UP to (4,7) \u274c (ENEMY BODY!), DOWN to (4,5) \u274c (OUR NECK!), LEFT to (3,6) \u2705, RIGHT to (5,6) \u2705.\n   - ONLY TWO SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN! TRAPPY! \ud83d\udcc9 Also, we'd be right next to enemy body wall. RISKY!\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,4) \u2013 PLAY IT SAFE?**\n   - From (4,4): UP to (4,5) \u274c (NECK!), DOWN to (4,3) \u2705, LEFT to (3,4) \u2705, RIGHT to (5,4) \u2705.\n   - THREE SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN! FLEXIBLE! \ud83e\udd14 But we're not eating. Gap becomes 9-13 likely. BAD!\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,5) \u2013 AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!**\n   - From (5,5): UP to (5,6) \u2705, DOWN to (5,4) \u2705, LEFT to (4,5) \u274c (NECK!), RIGHT to (6,5) \u274c (ENEMY BODY!).\n   - TWO SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN! But we move CLOSER to enemy head, threatening to cut off his leftward escape from (9,5) next turn if he eats (9,4). This could start boxing him into top-right corner! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is longer (12 apples). We CANNOT afford a head-on collision yet\u2014we'd lose! We need to grow while limiting his space. If he eats (9,4), his head will be at (9,4) or (9,5)? Wait, if he moves RIGHT to (9,4) and eats, his new head is (9,4), tail stays. His body will block (9,5). So next turn he'll be at (9,4) with few moves: UP (9,5) blocked by his own body, DOWN (9,3) open, LEFT (8,4) open, RIGHT off board. He'll be TRAPPED against the edge! If we position at (5,5) now, we can next move to (5,6) or (5,4) and then push leftward to cut off his escape route down the left side of the board. Meanwhile, we can target apples at (5,3) or (0,6) later. But we NEED TO EAT NOW! Gap is growing!\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (4,6) grabs the apple, grows us to 10, but leaves us with only 2 safe moves next turn\u2014SUICIDAL? Actually, looking at board, our only safe moves from (4,6) are LEFT and RIGHT. RIGHT (5,6) is safe and opens future options. LEFT (3,6) is safe but leads toward our own body maze. Hmm... BUT if we go UP and eat, we survive this turn and grow. That's PRIORITY ONE. We can't let gap hit 4 apples. Taking apple now sets up potential to cut enemy off later.\n\n**SAFETY OVERRIDE:** Actually, going UP to (4,6) is SAFE this turn. Next turn we'll have to choose LEFT or RIGHT, but both are safe from (4,6). We'll deal with it then. EATING NOW IS CRITICAL.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** WE GO UP, GRAB THAT APPLE, AND GROW! Then next turn we reassess and try to swing toward (5,3) or (3,8) while pressuring enemy. Let's close that gap! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Score becomes 11-13!\n   - New head at (5,5).

That's a DEAD END RISK! \ud83d\ude31 But eating the apple grows us, making us longer and maybe harder for enemy to avoid later.\n\n2. **UP to (5,7) \u2013 AVOID THE TRAP!**\n   - No apple. Score stays 10-13.\n   - New head at (5,7). Body: [(5,6), (4,6), ...]\n   - From (5,7): Check next turn:\n     * UP to (5,8) \u2705 EMPTY!\n     * DOWN to (5,6) \u274c OUR NECK!\n     * LEFT to (4,7) \u274c ENEMY BODY at (4,7)!\n     * RIGHT to (6,7) \u274c ENEMY BODY at (6,7)!\n   - ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN: UP to (5,8)! ALSO A DEAD END! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nBOTH MOVES LEAVE US WITH ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN! THAT'S SCARY! But DOWN gives us +1 apple and grows our length, which could help in a head-on collision later (we're still shorter than enemy length 14 vs our 11 after eating). UP does nothing for score.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is pinned near the right wall. We need to survive and pressure him. If we eat the apple, we get closer in score and length. If we go UP, we stay weaker and still trapped next turn. EATING THE APPLE IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We take the risk, then next turn we'll have to go DOWN to (5,4) and reassess. Maybe we can then cut off his escape routes!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** WE GO DOWN, EAT THAT APPLE, AND GROW! WE'LL FIGURE OUT NEXT TURN'S ESCAPE WHEN WE GET THERE!
