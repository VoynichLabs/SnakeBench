The closest apple to me is at (9, 8), which is 5 units to the right. Another apple is at (2, 0), (4, 4), (2, 6), and (7, 0) are also available.\n\nSince my current position is at (4, 8), and I want to get closer to the apples, I'll consider moving to the right to get closer to the apple at (9, 8) or moving down to get closer to the apple at (2, 0) or (4, 4). However, I should be cautious of the enemy snake's position to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nA possible strategy for the next few turns could be to move to the right to get closer to the apple at (9, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid any potential collisions. I should also consider the risk of moving to the right and potentially colliding with the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nFor now, my next move will be to move to the right to get closer to the apple at (9, 8) and keep an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nNext turn, I should continue to evaluate the board state and consider moving up or down if the enemy snake's position becomes a threat.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT"

I can't move LEFT as that would also hit my body. So my options are RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nThe closest apple is at (9, 8), which is just two spaces to my right. Moving RIGHT would get me closer to this apple, and I could capture it on the next move. This is clearly the optimal choice as it leads directly to scoring a point.\n\nMoving DOWN would take me away from the immediate apple and wouldn't position me better for any other apples in the short term.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8, 8), I'll plan to move RIGHT again to (9, 8) to capture the apple. After getting the apple, I'll likely want to start heading down to eventually target the apple at (7, 0), but I'll need to be careful about how I navigate downward without trapping myself.\n\nRIGHT"
