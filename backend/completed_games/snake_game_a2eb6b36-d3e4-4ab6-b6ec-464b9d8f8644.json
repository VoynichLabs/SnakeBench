My strategy of moving up the x=2 column is working perfectly!\n\nLet me analyze my current options from position (2, 6):\n- UP to (2, 7) - This will get me the apple at (2, 7)! This is exactly what I've been working toward.\n- DOWN to (2, 5) - DEATH! That's where my body segment is now\n- LEFT to (1, 6) - Safe, but moves away from my target apple\n- RIGHT to (3, 6) - Safe, but also moves away from my efficient path\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at position (8, 9) with body at [(8, 8), (8, 7)], so they're still on the right side of the board and not an immediate threat to me.\n\nThis is perfect! I'm exactly one move away from collecting the apple at (2, 7). After I get this apple, I can continue UP to (2, 8) to collect the second apple in this column. This will give me 2 points total and put me in an excellent position.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples after I collect (2, 7):\n- (2, 8) - Just one more UP move after getting the current target\n- (0, 6) - To my left, easily accessible \n- (7, 8) - Far away in the top right\n- (9, 4) - Far away near the enemy snake\n\nMy plan is working flawlessly. I'll collect the apple at (2, 7) this turn, then continue to (2, 8) for the second apple. After that, I can reassess and possibly go for the apple at (0, 6).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (2, 7), continue UP to (2, 8) to get the second apple in this column. This will maximize my efficiency and keep me away from the enemy snake.\n\nUP"
