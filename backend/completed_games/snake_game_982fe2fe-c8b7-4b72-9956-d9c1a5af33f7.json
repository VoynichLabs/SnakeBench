I moved RIGHT from (4, 7) to (5, 7), and now I'm positioned directly below the apple at (5, 8).\n\nCurrent apple positions:\n- (1, 3) - far left, would take 4 left + 4 down = 8 moves\n- (1, 9) - far left and up, would take 4 left + 2 up = 6 moves  \n- (5, 8) - directly above me, just 1 UP move away!\n- (8, 5) - right and down, would take 3 right + 2 down = 5 moves\n- (1, 5) - far left, would take 4 left + 2 down = 6 moves\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is still at (2, 4) with no body segments, so no immediate threat.\n\nThis is exactly the situation I planned for! The apple at (5, 8) is just one move UP from my current position at (5, 7). \n\nLet me verify UP is safe:\n- Going UP would move me to (5, 8) where the apple is\n- My body is at (4, 7), so no risk of hitting myself\n- No walls (5, 8) is well within bounds\n- No other snakes in the way\n- I'll collect the apple and grow, gaining 1 point\n\nThis is a guaranteed apple grab! After collecting this apple, I'll need to reassess and likely target the next closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (5, 8), I'll grow to length 3. Then I should target the next closest apple, which will likely be at (8, 5) - 3 moves RIGHT and 3 moves DOWN from (5, 8).\n\nUP"

The apple at (4, 4) is very close - I can reach it by going either:\n1. LEFT to (4, 5) then DOWN to (4, 4), or  \n2. DOWN to (5, 4) then LEFT to (4, 4)\n\nLet me check what's safe from my current position (5, 5):\n- UP to (5, 6): Safe - empty space\n- DOWN to (5, 4): Safe - empty space  \n- LEFT to (4, 5): Safe - empty space\n- RIGHT to (6, 5): Would hit my own body segment - DEATH\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (1, 3) and seems focused on the apple cluster in the bottom-left area around (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2). It's not threatening my target apple at (4, 4) immediately.\n\nI think the best approach is to go DOWN to (5, 4) first. This gives me a good angle to approach the apple at (4, 4) from the right side. From (5, 4), I can go LEFT to (4, 4) and collect the apple on my next turn.\n\nGoing DOWN also keeps me away from the upper part of the board where my body segments are clustered, giving me more maneuvering room.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching (5, 4), move LEFT to collect the apple at (4, 4). Then I'll need to quickly decide on my next target - probably one of the remaining apples at (3, 2), (1, 2), or (2, 2), depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nDOWN"

This gives me a clear vertical path to an apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 6), I'll be moving away from most apples and toward the top of the board where there are no immediate targets.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (3, 4), continue moving DOWN toward the apple at (3, 0).
