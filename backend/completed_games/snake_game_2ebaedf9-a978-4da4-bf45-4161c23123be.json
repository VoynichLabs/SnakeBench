Is there an apple at (1,4)? No. Is that safe? No, there's no apple, but we can check if it's safe. The position (1,4) is free.\n\n- Down: (1,2). Is that safe?

And importantly, there's an apple at (2,1), but that\u2019s two cells down, so probably not for immediate move.\n\nConsidering the apples:\n\n- The closest promising apple is at (4,4). To reach it, we need to move right three times and up once.\n\n- The apple at (4,3): right three times, then down.\n\n- The apple at (4,6): right three and up three.\n\nSince going toward (4,4) seems to be the most immediate and accessible target, moving RIGHT from (1,3) makes sense.\n\nNext, check if going right is safe:\n\n- (2,3): Safe, no enemy or wall.\n\n- From moving right, the next positions are also safe.\n\nSo, our plan:\n\n1.

But since (2,1) is two steps down and left from (2,3), perhaps better to focus on apples directly accessible.\n\n- Another accessible apple is at (4,3). To reach (4,3), from (1,3), need to move RIGHT twice (to (3,3)), then RIGHT again to (4,3). From current position, moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n- Also, apple at (4,4) is just above (4,3). Moving RIGHT to (2,3), then UP, then RIGHT again might be overcomplicated.\n\n- Consider safety: moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4) is safe, but no apple there.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (1,2) is safe, and closer to apples at (2,1).\n\n- Moving LEFT from (1,3) would go to (0,3), which is boundary but safe, but no immediate benefit.\n\nOur goal: head toward apples, especially those nearby and accessible, without risking collisions.\n\nBased on this, moving RIGHT seems good for now to start advancing toward the apples at (4,3) and (4,4). Moving RIGHT from (1,3) to (2,3) is safe, and sets us up for subsequent moves.\n\nNext considerations:\n- Moving RIGHT again to (3,3), then to (4,3) to eat that apple.\n- Or moving UP after moving right to approach (4,4).\n\nGiven the current move, moving RIGHT is the simplest step to progress toward apples.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

The last move was UP, so currently, our head is at (8,5).\n- Our body is at [(8,4)]\u2014so only one segment below.\n- Enemy snake is at (8,8) with body at [(8,7), (7,7), (7,8), (6,8)]. Notably, enemy snake\u2019s head is at (8,8), which is two steps above our current position. Its body parts are further along, so no immediate collision risk at the moment.\n- Apples are at (4,4), (2,1), (1,0), (7,9), and (2,8). The apple at (8,7) is adjacent above our current position; moving up now would place us at (8,6), approaching that apple.\n\nPotential dangers:\n- Moving UP from (8,5) to (8,6): safe initially; no obstacle.\n- Moving UP again from (8,6) to (8,7): would land us on the apple, which is good.\n- The enemy's body at (8,7) raises a concern; do they occupy that position? The enemy's body includes (8,7), so moving into (8,7) now would cause collision.\n\nWait, actually, the enemy's body is at [(8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,8)]:\n- So (8,7) **is** occupied by the enemy's body part, so moving directly up into (8,7) would be a collision with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, moving UP now would lead us into the enemy's body segment. That is risky.\n\nAlternative moves:\n- DOWN: would go back to (8,4), which is our tail; unsafe (would collide with our own body if we try to go backward).\n- LEFT: move to (7,5), empty space. Not helpful in reaching the apple.\n- RIGHT: move to (9,5). No immediate obstacle, but again not helpful toward the apple at (8,7).\n\nSince the apple at (8,7) is dangerous to reach directly due to enemy occupation, perhaps we should seek a different apple or position.\n\nOther apples:\n- (4,4): far away, would require multiple turns.\n- (2,1) and (1,0): lower left corner, far away.\n- (2,8): directly above our current position, at (8,8). But (2,8) is far as well.\n\nGiven our current location, the best immediate move seems to be to go RIGHT to (9,5), avoiding collision with the enemy snake\u2019s body at (8,7). Moving RIGHT increases x from 8 to 9, which is safe.\n\nNext, perhaps plan to head upwards toward other apples or set up for longer-term strategies.\n\nFinal check:\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,5): safe (no snake body there, within board).\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN would lead us backward or into walls, which is bad.\n- Moving UP would lead into enemy's body at (8,7). Not safe.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Moving RIGHT now is the safest immediate move to avoid collision and position ourselves better for future turns.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
