The enemy is chilling at (1,2) with no body, so no immediate head\u2011on risk. Our possible moves: UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7). Moving RIGHT would slam into our own tail\u2014INSTANT DEATH, so that\u2019s out! All three other moves stay on the board and don\u2019t hit any snake body. Which one gives us the best shot at apples? The nearest apple is at (5,8) just two steps away. If we go UP now, we\u2019ll be at (6,8) and can snag that apple next turn by moving LEFT. If we go LEFT now, we can snag it by moving UP. Both are fine, but I like the vertical push\u2014feels more aggressive! So let\u2019s go UP to (6,8), keep our body in a straight line, and set up that left hook for the apple. After that, we\u2019ll keep marching up the top row, collect that whole cluster of apples, and use our growing body to cut off the opponent later. If we keep our lead, we can even force a head\u2011on collision and take the win! Remember, we can\u2019t win if we\u2019re dead, so always watch our body. Alright, enough chat\u2014let\u2019s make our move!\n\nStrategy note for future self: Next turn go LEFT to (5,8) to eat the apple, then UP to (5,9), then continue left across the top row. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s position and look for a chance to trap them!\n\nUP",

That's how you build a SNAKE EMPIRE, chat! We get that length advantage and then we can start making his life miserable.

The board is looking spicy\u2014our snake\u2019s head is at (2,5) and we\u2019ve got a shiny apple just one step away at (2,3). The enemy is still chilling down at (4,3) with only 3 apples, way behind our score. We can\u2019t let them catch up, so we gotta keep growing and cut off their escape routes!\n\nLet\u2019s break down the moves real quick:\n- **UP** is a death sentence because that\u2019s our own neck at (2,6). \u274c  \n- **LEFT** to (1,5) and **RIGHT** to (3,5) are safe, but they don\u2019t grab any fruit right now.  \n- **DOWN** to (2,4) is safe, puts us one step away from that apple at (2,3), and keeps our tail at (4,9) blocking the right side\u2014perfect for a future squeeze play! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nEating that apple next turn will bump our score to 7 and give us the length we need to start boxing them in. After we snag (2,3), we\u2019ll pivot right, head toward the center, and begin walling off their exits. If they ever try a head\u2011on collision, our higher score means we win that trade. No mercy\u2014let\u2019s dominate this board! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nPlan: After this move, eat the apple at (2,3) next turn, then start moving right to encircle the enemy and cut off his escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is right there on the right side, but we\u2019re hugging the left wall like a boss! The board is basically a 10\u00d710 arena and we\u2019re about to turn it into our personal playground. \n\n**Safe moves?**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (0,7) \u2013 wide open, no bodies, no apples yet but it keeps us on that sweet left wall.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 also safe, but it pulls us away from the juicy apples stacked at the top left.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0,5) \u2013 that\u2019s our own body, instant RIP. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 off the map, nope. \u274c\n\nSo we\u2019ve got two real options. **UP** moves us straight toward those apples at (0,8) and (0,9) while keeping our options open for a quick pivot later. **RIGHT** would delay our apple haul and doesn\u2019t put us in a better spot to cut off the enemy.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely moves** \u2013 they can go UP to (9,6) (there\u2019s an apple there!), or DOWN to (9,4). They can\u2019t go LEFT because they\u2019d crash into their own body, and RIGHT is suicide. None of those intersect with our path if we go UP, so we avoid an immediate head\u2011on clash.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan (next 3\u20114 turns):**  \nKeep marching **UP** to (0,7) \u2192 (0,8) (eat that apple!) \u2192 (0,9) (eat that apple!). Once we\u2019ve snagged those two apples and grown to 10, we\u2019ll pivot **RIGHT** across the top row and start cutting off the enemy\u2019s escape routes. If they try to meet us head\u2011on later, we\u2019ll have the extra apple and the score lead to win the double\u2011KO.\n\nRemember, we can\u2019t win if we\u2019re dead, but we also can\u2019t win if we don\u2019t eat apples. So let\u2019s stack those apples and then turn the heat up!\n\n**Plan for future self:** Continue UP to (0,8) and (0,9) to grab apples, then turn RIGHT to begin boxing in the opponent.\n\nUP",

It's a clean, aggressive line that keeps our options open.\n\n**3\u2011TURN PLAN:**\n1. **THIS TURN:** UP to (0,9) \u2013 eat, score 10\u20119.\n2. **TURN\u202f22:** RIGHT to (1,9) \u2013 eat again, extend lead.\n3. **TURN\u202f23:** DOWN to (1,8) then RIGHT to (2,8) \u2013 grab the apple at (2,8) and start spreading across the top row.\n\nAfter that we keep pushing east across the top, collect the remaining top\u2011row apples, and then start building a wall to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Keep an eye on those right\u2011side apples (8,4), (8,2), (8,1) \u2013 don't let them snack for free!\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE ME:**\nFuture me \u2013 after we snag (0,9) now, go RIGHT to (1,9) next turn, then DOWN\u2011RIGHT to (2,8) to keep the apple train rolling. Stay aggressive, watch the opponent's tail, and keep the pressure on. Let's take this board!\n\nUP",

This apple puts us further ahead, and from (1,9) we can keep pushing east across the top row\u2014there\u2019s another apple at (2,9) and (3,9) just waiting for us! We\u2019ll gobble them up, grow longer, and then start dropping down toward the right side to cut off the opponent\u2019s escape routes. We\u2019ll box them in like a boss! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\ude24\n\n**3\u2011TURN PLAN:**\n1. **THIS TURN:** RIGHT to (1,9) \u2013 eat, lead 11\u20119.\n2. **TURN\u202f23:** RIGHT to (2,9) \u2013 eat again, extend the lead.\n3. **TURN\u202f24:** RIGHT to (3,9) \u2013 keep that apple train rollin\u2019!\n\nAfter that we\u2019ll turn DOWN and start marching toward those juicy right\u2011side apples (8,4, 8,3, 8,2, 8,1) and set up a wall to force the enemy into a crash. Keep an eye on their tail\u2014if they get too close, we can always pivot and force a head\u2011on collision since we\u2019re ahead on points! Let\u2019s dominate this board! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 26, we're up 12-10, but we can't let off the gas! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current state check:**\n- My head is at (3,8). My body is hugging the left wall - I'm a big L-shape dominating that side!\n- Rival's head is at (3,6). They're sitting RIGHT BELOW US with their body stretched across the middle!\n- Safe moves: DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8) for that juicy apple, or RIGHT to (4,8). UP is death - that's our own neck! \u274c\n\n**Why DOWN is the ONLY play:**\nListen chat, we're not here to play nice - we're here to WIN! Moving DOWN to (3,7) puts us DIRECTLY above their head. If they panic and move UP to (3,7), we get that HEAD-ON CLUTCH and WIN INSTANTLY 12-10! That's a 33% chance of IMMEDIATE VICTORY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nEven if they don't take the bait:\n- If they go DOWN to (3,5), we can pivot LEFT to (2,7) and start munching that apple at (2,8)\n- If they go LEFT to (2,6), we swing RIGHT to (4,7) and start hunting the apple at (5,8)\n\nMoving LEFT to eat the apple now? That's passive, chat! No pressure! Moving RIGHT? That's just running away! We're WINNERS, we don't run! \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**3-turn domination plan:**\n1. **Turn 26 (NOW):** DOWN to (3,7) - Force the collision threat! \n2. **Turn 27:** React to their move. If they dodge down/left, we take control of the center.\n3. **Turn 28:** Start the apple harvest while keeping them boxed in.\n\nWe're playing 4D chess while they're playing checkers!

Both snakes die, but we have **13 apples vs their 10**, so we WIN the round! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nCan they dodge it? NO! Any other move they make (left, right, or down) runs them straight into our body and they die anyway. Are we about to let them survive? ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is the checkmate move! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Future me:** After this head\u2011on KO the game ends with our victory. If they somehow chicken out and die earlier, just keep the body safe and maybe slither to a couple more apples for the content, but the W is already locked!\n\nLEFT",
