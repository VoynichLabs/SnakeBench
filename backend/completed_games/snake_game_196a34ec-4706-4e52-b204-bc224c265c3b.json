But I'm not shrinking yet (since I just grew); if I go onto my body, I must be careful.\n\n   Let's double-check the mechanics:\n   - I just ate an apple. So, my length increased by 1, and my body is now [(4,7)]. If I move RIGHT to (4,7), I crash into myself. Risk of self-collision: YES.\n\n   Therefore, moving RIGHT is an instant suicide.\n\n2. **Are any apples adjacent?**\n   - UP: (3,8): nothing\n   - DOWN: (3,6): nothing, but (2,6) is left-down, so reachable.\n   - LEFT: (2,7): nothing, but (2,6) is down-left.\n   - (2,6) is a prime apple to go for next.\n\n3. **Enemy assessment:**\n   - Enemy is at (2,5), about 2 squares down-left from me.\n   - If I go DOWN then LEFT (toward (2,6)), I'll be near (2,5), but the enemy is currently south of that and hasn't demonstrated aggression. Still, I should be alert for head-to-head situations (ties may result in both dying).\n\n4. **Path to next apple:**\n   - (2,6) is the only nearby apple.\n   - From (3,7), the quickest route:\n     - DOWN: (3,6) then LEFT: (2,6)\n     - LEFT then DOWN: (2,7) then DOWN: (2,6)\n   - Is either better? Moving LEFT puts me above the apple, but the enemy is below.\n   - Moving DOWN puts me beside the apple (left), but closer to the enemy.\n\n   **Turns ahead:**\n   - After DOWN to (3,6), enemy is at (2,5)\u2013one square away diagonally. If enemy moves UP, would reach (2,6).\n   - If I go DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), I get the apple next turn unless enemy makes a perfect beeline.\n\n5. **Is enemy likely to beat me to (2,6)?**\n   - Enemy at (2,5): could move UP (2,6) and steal apple this turn.\n   - But, as per the last board, the enemy's body is empty (maybe a new snake, maybe just ate?).\n   - If I'm moving DOWN, and enemy moves UP, enemy gets (2,6) first, but there is no indication so far.\n\n   **Best-case:**\n   - Enemy hesitates, I get the apple.\n   **Worst-case:**\n   - Enemy takes (2,6) before me; then I need to redirect.\n\n---\n\n**Safety Check for my moves:**\n- UP (3,8): Safe, but no apple closer.\n- DOWN (3,6): Safe, brings me toward (2,6), but potentially nearer to enemy. No immediate threat. \n- LEFT (2,7): Safe, but further from the apple.\n- RIGHT (4,7): My own body\u2014**unsafe!** (instant death)\n\n**Prioritizing:**\n- DOWN is most direct toward apple.\n- If I go LEFT, then down, I approach same apple but from above.\n- Going UP is safe but not progressing toward apples, and delays my score.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Move DOWN (to 3,6) to get in position for potentially taking (2,6) next turn.\n- Watch for enemy at (2,5). If they take (2,6), re-evaluate next apples (most are at top right).\n\n**Strategy Next Turn:**  \n- If enemy goes for (2,6), consider apples on right half of the board (8,5), (8,2), (9,4), (9,1).\n- Don't risk head-to-head crash with enemy unless I can guarantee the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**\n\n**DOWN**\n\n**(Move to (3,6), try to get first to the (2,6) apple, stay mindful of enemy at (2,5).
