Snake #1 is at (4, 6), which is also close to (5, 6), but I'm positioned slightly better to reach it first if I move UP now.\n\n**Future planning**: If I move UP to (5, 5) this turn, next turn I can collect the apple at (5, 6) by moving UP again. Snake #1 would need two moves to reach (5, 6) from (4, 6), so I should be able to get there first.\n\nUP",

If I move UP and snake #1 moves away, I could potentially collect an apple. If snake #1 stays or moves back, we'll collide. This is risky.\n\n2. **DOWN**: (5, 4) - This is my own body segment, would cause self-collision.\n\n3. **LEFT**: (4, 5) - Empty cell, safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 5) - Empty cell, safe.\n\nSo I have two definitely safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. UP is risky due to potential collision with snake #1, and DOWN would kill me by hitting my own body.\n\n**LEFT (4, 5)**: This moves me toward the apple at (4, 9), but that would require 4 moves UP.

This also opens up space to avoid snake #1.\n\n**Strategic consideration**: Snake #1 has 4 apples vs my 2, putting me at a disadvantage. I need to be aggressive about collecting apples while avoiding unnecessary risks. Given that snake #1's head is at (5, 6), moving UP would be very risky - they might move away or they might not. The safe bet is to avoid direct confrontation and go for apples that don't require immediate conflict.\n\n**Risk assessment**: Moving UP could potentially work if snake #1 moves away, but if they don't move or move back toward me, I die. Given snake #1's strong position (4 apples), they might be more conservative, but it's not worth the risk when I have safe alternatives.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT gives the most conservative, safe choice: it keeps multiple escape routes and avoids directly engaging the enemy head near the close apple cluster. I\u2019m already leading on apples, so preserving life and options is high priority.\n- DOWN is the only move that immediately contests the nearby apples, but it has higher contest/trap risk from snake #0.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT now to (4,6) to maintain safety and keep options open.\n- From there, evaluate snake #0\u2019s behavior: if they commit left/down toward (1,5)/(0,5) I\u2019ll either cut them off safely or avoid a head-on fight and go to other available apples (7,8 or 9,5) later.\n- Prioritize staying alive and keeping 2+ escape options each turn rather than forcing a contested apple.\n\nRIGHT",

UP: (2, 6) - Snake #1's body segment! Would cause collision with enemy body\n2. DOWN: (2, 4) - Empty cell, safe\n3. LEFT: (1, 5) - Apple! Safe and beneficial\n4. RIGHT: (3, 5) - My own body! Would cause self-collision\n\n**Analysis:**\nUP is eliminated due to enemy body at (2, 6), RIGHT is eliminated due to my own body at (3, 5). I have two safe moves: DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- LEFT to (1, 5) directly collects an apple, growing my snake and increasing my score to 4 apples\n- LEFT positions me well to continue toward (0, 5) on subsequent turns\n- DOWN to (2, 4) moves me away from the apple cluster and doesn't immediately collect any apples\n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**\nSnake #1's head is at (4, 6) and poses a potential threat. From (4, 6), it could move:\n- UP to (4, 7) - empty\n- DOWN to (4, 5) - empty\n- LEFT to (3, 6) - its own body\n- RIGHT to (5, 6) - empty\n\nIf it moves DOWN to (4, 5), it would be adjacent to my current position but wouldn't threaten me if I move LEFT to (1, 5).\n\nLEFT is clearly the optimal move as it collects an apple while moving me toward the remaining apple cluster at (0, 5) and away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 5), I'll be at 4 apples. My next move should focus on reaching (0, 5) to continue collecting the nearby apple cluster while avoiding the enemy snake that's positioned in the upper right area.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN would be more aggressive and increases risk of head-on contest or getting boxed.\n\nEvaluation:\n- Avoid immediate fights: enemy head at (2,5) is much closer to the left apples, so contesting them (DOWN) is risky and unnecessary since I already lead on apples.\n- Keep options open: RIGHT keeps 3 follow-up directions and leads toward safe, uncontested apples on the right/upper-right.\n- UP is safe but slightly more constraining; RIGHT is the better conservative choice to maintain mobility and life advantage.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (5,6) to maintain safety and flexibility.\n- From there, head toward (7,8) or (9,5) depending on how snake #0 behaves; avoid contesting the left apple cluster unless opponent clearly leaves them open.\n- Always prefer moves that keep >=2 escape options and avoid moving into cells adjacent to the enemy head when unnecessary.\n\nRIGHT",

Moves closer to the left/top apples (2,9 and 0,8), stays away from the board edge, and gives multiple follow-up exits (up/left/down) so keeps mobility highest.\n\nSafety check: none of UP, DOWN, LEFT move into occupied cells this turn, and the enemy head is far away so head-on risk is negligible.\n\nChoice reasoning: LEFT is the best balance of safety, mobility, and progress toward reachable apples (2,9 and 0,8). UP pushes to the edge (fewer options). DOWN tightens my immediate options and could start boxing me in against my own body. So prefer LEFT to keep options open while approaching apples on the left side.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Continue moving left/up to secure (2,9) and (0,8) while avoiding the board edge and tight turns.\n- After grabbing left apples, reassess and consider routing toward the right-side apples only if it can be done without self-trapping.\n- Keep monitoring the enemy (head at 1,2) \u2014 unlikely to contest current targets but could approach the bottom-left apple (1,0).\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT: (6, 6) - Contains an apple! This would grow my snake and give me 8 apples\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- DOWN is immediately eliminated (into my own body at (5, 5))\n- Both UP and RIGHT lead directly to apples - this is an excellent situation!\n- Moving UP to (5, 7) collects the apple there and puts me at 8 apples total\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 6) also collects an apple and puts me at 8 apples total\n- Snake #1 is at (2, 6), quite far from me, so no immediate collision risk\n- From (5, 7), I could continue toward the cluster of apples at (7, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)\n- From (6, 6), I could also reach those right-side apples\n\n**Best path forward:**\nI'll go UP to (5, 7) to collect that apple. This continues my upward trajectory from last turn and positions me well for the apple cluster on the right side. After collecting this apple, I'll have 8 apples and can plan my route to (6, 6), (7, 4), and beyond.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving UP to (5, 7) and collecting that apple, I'll evaluate moves toward the right-side apples while monitoring Snake #1's position.\n\nUP",

Enemy head at (5,6) could move left or right, but moving right keeps options to dodge (go up to 3,7 or continue east) and maintains initiative toward apples.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue east along y=6 toward (6,6)/(5,7), but monitor the enemy head at x\u22484\u20136. If the enemy shifts to contest the same cells, use y=7 (up) to avoid head-on collisions and preserve space; drop to y=5 only if safe and not into their body.

UP (2,8) and DOWN (2,6) are currently occupied by my body, so my only non-backwards move would be LEFT to (1,7). That funnels me into a tight corridor surrounded by my own body and risks getting trapped with very few escape options.\n\nRIGHT analysis:\n- Moving to (4,7) keeps multiple safe follow-ups because the current tail (4,8) will free up and (4,8) and (4,6) will be available next turn. It also moves me toward the nearby apple at (6,6) while keeping flexibility to avoid the enemy head at (6,7). Enemy #0 can try to go down to (6,6) for that apple, so I won\u2019t commit to a straight rush \u2014 instead I\u2019ll use (4,7) to maintain options (UP or DOWN) and react to the enemy\u2019s choice.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take RIGHT to preserve freedom.

This positions me better for reaching apples at (5, 2), (8, 8), or eventually looping back to (9, 2)\n5. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nLEFT",

I can continue moving left along the top edge, then start moving down the left side of the board to approach those apples from above.

Looking at distances:\n- (5, 6) is the closest at Manhattan distance 4 from (6, 8)\n- (9, 2) is distance 9\n- (5, 2) is distance 6\n- (0, 0) is distance 14\n- (9, 1) is distance 10\n\nMoving toward (5, 6) makes the most sense. The apple at (5, 6) is in column 5, so moving LEFT toward x=5 is the right direction. However, I need to consider the path carefully since Snake #1 is positioned around (4, 5) and may also be targeting this apple.\n\n**Considering each safe move:**\n- **LEFT (5, 8)**: Moves me closer to the (5, 6) apple (distance becomes 3). This positions me well and keeps me in relatively open space.\n- **DOWN (6, 7)**: Also moves me closer to (5, 6) (distance becomes 3. This gives me flexibility to then move left or continue down.\n- **RIGHT (7, 8)**: Takes me away from most apples and toward the crowded right side where Snake #1's tail extends.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are good moves toward (5, 6). However, Snake #1's head is at (4, 5), so if I move LEFT and then plan to go down toward (5, 6), I need to be cautious about potential collisions.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nMoving DOWN to (6, 7) might be safer as it keeps more distance from Snake #1's head and gives me more options for subsequent moves (I could then go LEFT to (5, 7) or (5, 6)).\n\nLEFT",

While likely safe this turn (they can't move back into their neck), it keeps me adjacent to the opponent and increases chance of head-on or tactical fights in next turns.\n- LEFT pushes toward my own body loop and the crowded left/top area \u2014 higher trap risk.\n- RIGHT is the safest: it avoids immediate adjacency to the enemy head, preserves multiple escape routes, and keeps options to go around the enemy to access the lower apples (5,2) and (9,2).\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6) now to create distance from the enemy head.\n- From there, navigate down toward the cluster of lower apples (5,2) and (9,2), avoiding the top-right cluster around snake #0.\n- Preserve open lanes; avoid re-entering the cramped left/top region of my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN keeps multiple safe moves and preserves the ability to pivot to (5,2) in a couple turns while avoiding the enemy cluster to the right (enemy head at (7,6) can move DOWN or LEFT but doesn't force an immediate head-on if I go DOWN). \n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue down column x=6 to around y=2 to keep options open.\n- Then pivot left to take (5,2) if still safe; only go right toward x=9 if the enemy clears out and it is clearly safe.\n- Avoid entering tight corridors near the enemy body cluster; keep three-way options where possible.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT moves me toward the center where snake #1 is active, while DOWN keeps me more to the eastern side. Given that snake #1 is at (6, 4) and likely heading south toward apples, LEFT to (6, 6) positions me well to compete for those apples while staying in a reasonably open area.\n\nLEFT",
