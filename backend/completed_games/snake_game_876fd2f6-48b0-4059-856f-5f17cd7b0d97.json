Let's break down this battlefield.\n\n**Our Plan to Box Them In:**\nWe're at (2,8) with no body yet\u2014fresh start! Enemy snake #0 is at (8,5) also with no body. We're DEAD EVEN on apples (0-0). Time to be AGGRESSIVE and force a head-on collision if we get the advantage.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate Safe Moves**\n- **UP**: To (2,9) \u2014 on board \u2705, not hitting our body (none) \u2705, not hitting enemy body (none) \u2705. SAFE.\n- **DOWN**: To (2,7) \u2014 on board \u2705, not hitting our body \u2705, not hitting enemy body \u2705. SAFE.\n- **LEFT**: To (1,8) \u2014 on board \u2705, not hitting our body \u2705, not hitting enemy body \u2705. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT**: To (3,8) \u2014 on board \u2705, not hitting our body \u2705, but wait\u2014(3,8) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e SAFE and HIGH REWARD.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Aggressive Strategy**\nRight now, all 4 moves are safe. But we need to DOMINATE. The apple at (3,8) is RIGHT THERE\u2014we can grab it and grow immediately! That gives us a +1 advantage. Plus, moving RIGHT keeps us central and opens up more options next turn.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the Play:**\n1. **Instant Content**: Free apple = +1 point. We lead the scoreboard immediately.\n2. **Positioning**: From (3,8), we're still high on the board but can pivot down/left/right next turn. Options are OPEN.\n3. **Pressure on Enemy**: If we grow, we become the bigger threat. Snake #0 might panic or make a mistake.\n4. **Avoid Traps**: Moving UP to (2,9) corners us at the top. LEFT to (1,8) is okay but less central. DOWN to (2,7) is fine but no apple.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nAfter eating (3,8), I'll pivot down towards the center and watch enemy movement. Force a head-on collision if I get 2+ apples and they stay at 0. Don't let them get to any apples first\u2014cut them off!\n\nLet's get this bread, CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcbb\n\nRIGHT",

So the smartest, most aggressive\u2011yet\u2011safe pick is to **head upward** and keep my options open.  \n\nLet\u2019s do this! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nUP",

Apples available: (8,1), (8,2), (9,4), (1,3), (7,7), (4,7), (1,6), (9,1), (3,1), (2,3), (7,9), (1,4), (6,8), (0,5), (7,4).  \n\n**EVALUATING ALL MOVES:**  \n1. **UP to (3,9):** On board \u2705, not my body \u2705, not enemy body \u2705. SAFE. But (3,9) has no apple and borders top-right corner\u2014might limit future moves.  \n2. **DOWN to (3,7):** On board \u2705, not my body \u2705, not enemy body \u2705. SAFE. (3,7) has no apple, but opens up movement toward center apples like (4,7) or (7,7).  \n3. **LEFT to (2,8):** On board \u2705, not my body \u2705, not enemy body \u2705. **BUT WAIT!** (2,8) is my current tail! If I move LEFT, my head goes into my own tail cell. According to rules: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" **DEADLY MOVE!** \ud83d\udeab  \n4. **RIGHT to (4,8):** On board \u2705, not my body \u2705, not enemy body \u2705. SAFE. No apple at (4,8), but central position\u2014good for future plays.  \n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**  \nAvoiding LEFT (suicide). UP corners me at (3,9) with only 2 escape routes next turn (DOWN or RIGHT). DOWN to (3,7) gives more space but no immediate apple. RIGHT to (4,8) is balanced\u2014central, safe, and lets me pivot to apples like (4,7) or (7,7) next turn.  \n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** No apple on immediate moves, so I prioritize board control. Heading RIGHT to (4,8) sets up a dive toward the cluster of apples in the center (7,7), (4,7), (6,8). Meanwhile, I'll monitor opponent snake #0 at (8,6)\u2014if they move toward apples, I can cut them off.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**  \nFrom (4,8), assess opponent\u2019s move. If they go for apples at (8,1) or (9,4), I\u2019ll chase central apples (4,7) or (7,7) to build lead. If they approach, prepare to force head-on collision if I get a score advantage.

Let's review the board and the enemy.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (4, 7), Body at [(4, 8), (3, 8)]. Length 3.\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 Head at (7, 7), Body at [(7, 6)]. Length 2.\n- **Score:** Me (2) vs Enemy (1). I have the lead!\n- **Apples:** (7, 7) is right next to the enemy's head. He's probably going for it.\n- **Boxing Strategy:** We need to cut him off. The gap between us is tight. We need to close in!\n\n**MOVES FROM (4, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** **DANGER!** My body is at (4, 8). If I move UP, I crash into myself. **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe. Open space. But leads away from the enemy. Passive.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves towards the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Safe. **CRITICAL POSITION!** This moves me directly into the path between the enemy and the apple at (7, 7).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 7). If they move UP to (7, 8), they might get an apple, but they move away from the center. If they move DOWN, they hit their own tail (7, 6)? No, tail is (7, 6). If they move DOWN to (7, 5), they are safe.\nBut here is the trap: The apple at (6, 8) is close. The enemy is at (7, 7).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (5, 7), I am closing the distance.\nLet's look at the coordinate grid.\n(4, 7) -> (5, 7).\nEnemy at (7, 7).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), and I move RIGHT to (5, 7), we are adjacent.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (7, 8), they get the apple (9, 8)? No, (9, 8) is empty. (6, 8) has an apple.\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 8: `A . . T T A A . . .` -> (0,8) is A, (3,8) is T (my tail), (4,8) is T (my body), (5,8) empty, (6,8) empty, (7,8) empty.\nWait, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ... (6, 8) ...\".\nLet me re-read the board state string for row 8.\n`8 A . . T T A A . . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:T, 4:T, 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.\nWait, the apples listed are (6,8) and (7,9) and (5,8). The board state text seems to be slightly outdated or simplified? No, the prompt says \"BOARD STATE:\" then the map.\nThe map shows Row 8: `A . . T T A A . . .`\nIf (6,8) is an Apple on the map (index 6 is A), then (7,8) is also an Apple (index 7 is A).\nHowever, the \"APPLE DROPS\" list is the definitive source of where apples *are*.\n(6, 8) is in the list.\n(5, 8) is in the list? No, (5, 8) is in the list? Yes, (5, 8) is in the \"APPLE DROPS\" list. (5, 8).\nWait, looking at the list: `(5, 8)` is there.\nSo (5, 8) is an apple. (6, 8) is an apple.\nThe map shows (5,8) as `.` and (6,8) as `A`.\nThere is a discrepancy between the visual map and the list. The list is the truth.\nSo: (5, 8) is an apple. (6, 8) is an apple.\n\n**RE-EVALUATING MOVES:**\n**RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n- This puts my head at (5, 7).\n- I am now in line with the enemy at (7, 7).\n- If the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), we are neighbors. I am safe because I am moving into (5, 7) and he is moving into (6, 7). We don't collide.\n- If the enemy moves UP to (7, 8), he moves away.\n- If the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 6), he hits his own tail? His tail is at (7, 6)? No, his body is [(7, 6)]. So (7, 6) is his body. If he moves DOWN to (7, 6), he dies.\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 7), he goes for the right side.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the best move:**\n1.  **Aggression:** I am closing the distance on the enemy.\n2.  **Positioning:** From (5, 7), I have options. I can go UP to (5, 8) which is an apple! (According to the list).\n3.  **Safety:** It's a valid move (not into my body, not off board).\n4.  **Blocking:** If the enemy wants to get to the apples at (6,8) or (5,8), I am now closer or in a position to contest them.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- UP: Crash into (4, 8). **DEAD.**\n- DOWN: (4, 6). Safe, but passive. I lose the center.\n- LEFT: (3, 7). Safe, but moves away from the enemy and the dense apple cluster (5,8, 6,8).\n- RIGHT: (5, 7). **The Play.** It sets up a potential head-on collision if the enemy moves LEFT, but since I have more apples (2 vs 1), if we collide, *I win*. It also gets me closer to the apple at (5, 8) for the next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7). Next turn, I will likely be able to eat the apple at (5, 8) by moving UP. This puts me at length 4 and solidifies my lead. While I do this, I will watch the enemy. If they move aggressively towards me, I hold the ground. If they flee, I chase. We are boxing them in against the right wall.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down the current battlefield. \ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **My Score:** 2 \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **Enemy Score:** 1 \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **My Head:** (5, 7)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 7)]\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe are currently sitting at (5, 7). The enemy is at (6, 7). We are neighbors! \ud83d\udc40\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4, 7), I retreat. That's soft. We don't retreat.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5, 6), I drop down. That's safe, but I lose the central column pressure.\nIf I move **UP** to (5, 8), I see an apple at (5, 8) in the list! \ud83c\udf4e But I have to be careful. (5, 8) is currently empty on the visual map, but the list says it's there. The enemy is right next to me. If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), and I move **UP** to (5, 8), we don't collide. That's safe.\nHowever, look at the enemy's body. It's at (7, 7). If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), they are moving into a space I am vacating. That's fine.\nBut wait! If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), they are adjacent to me. No crash.\nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (6, 8), and I move **UP** to (5, 8), no crash.\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (6, 6), no crash.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI want that apple at (5, 8). It's right there. If I grab it, I grow to length 4 and extend my lead to 3-1.\nIs (5, 8) safe?\nLet's check the map for (5, 8). The map shows `.` (empty). The apple list shows (5, 8) is an apple.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 8), I eat the apple.\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), we are adjacent.\nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (6, 8), we are diagonal.\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (6, 6), we are far.\nIf the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (7, 7) (wait, they are at 6,7. Right is 7,7). (7, 7) is currently empty? No, the enemy body is [(7, 7)]. So the enemy cannot move RIGHT. They are blocked by their own tail.\nSo the enemy can only move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (5, 8). It's a high-value target. If I don't take it, the enemy might swing for it next turn. But I am closer.\nHowever, there is an apple at (6, 8) listed too. If I go **UP** to (5, 8), I eat (5, 8). The enemy could go **UP** to (6, 8) and eat (6, 8). That would be equal growth.\nBUT, if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), and I move **UP** to (5, 8), I am safe.\nCrucially, if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 7), they are moving into the spot I just left. That's safe for me.\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (6, 6), they are moving away.\n\nIs there a danger?\nLet's check collisions.\nMy move UP to (5, 8). My body is at (5, 7) (current head, will become neck), (4, 7), (4, 8). (5, 8) is empty. No self-collision.\nEnemy move?\nIf Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 7): No collision with me (I'm at 5, 8).\nIf Enemy goes UP to (6, 8): No collision with me (I'm at 5, 8).\nIf Enemy goes DOWN to (6, 6): No collision.\n\n**Why LEFT? (Wait, I said UP is the apple... let me re-read the prompt)**\nThe prompt says: \"APPLE DROPS: (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (9, 1), (3, 1), (2, 3), (7, 9), (1, 4), (6, 8), (0, 5), (7, 4), (5, 8), (0, 8)\"\nYES! (5, 8) IS AN APPLE.\nAnd (6, 8) IS AN APPLE.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: `A . . T T A A . . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:T, 4:T, 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.\nWait, the map shows Row 8 Index 5 is `.`.\nBut the list says (5, 8) is an apple.\nThere is a conflict between the visual map and the apple list.\n**ALWAYS TRUST THE LIST.** The list is the source of truth for apple locations. The map is a representation.\nSo (5, 8) IS an apple.\n(6, 8) IS an apple.\n\nSo I can go **UP** to (5, 8) and eat an apple.\nOR I can go **RIGHT** to (6, 7). But (6, 7) is where the enemy is CURRENTLY.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), we cross paths but don't collide. That is allowed.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and the enemy stays put (impossible, they must move) or moves into me.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), we are adjacent.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 6), we are adjacent.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), we swap spots. Safe.\n\nHowever, going **RIGHT** puts me directly adjacent to the enemy. If the enemy moves into my body on the next turn, I die.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 8), I am eating an apple. I am moving away from the enemy. This is generally safer.\nBut wait, the prompt says: \"Be aggressive\". \"Box him in\".\nIf I go **UP**, I secure the apple and gain length.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I retreat to (4, 7). That's boring.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I go to (5, 6). That's safe but no apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6, 8).\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 8), I am next to the apple at (6, 8).\nIf the enemy goes **UP** to (6, 8), they get that apple.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 8), I get the apple at (5, 8).\nThis is a trade I can win. I get +1, enemy might get +1. I remain ahead 3-2 (or 3-1 if they don't eat).\nActually, if I eat (5, 8), I become length 4.\nIf enemy eats (6, 8), they become length 3 (currently length 2).\nI will still have the lead.\n\nIs there any move that kills me?\n**UP to (5, 8):**\n- Not off board.\n- Not into my body (My body: (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)). (5, 8) is empty.\n- Not into enemy body (Enemy body: (7, 7)). (5, 8) is empty.\n**SAFE.**\n\n**Why not RIGHT?**\nRight to (6, 7). (6, 7) is currently occupied by the enemy HEAD.\nIf I move into the enemy HEAD at the same time they move away, it's safe.\nBut if the enemy moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, I am safe.\nHowever, if the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), that is their own body (7, 7). They die.\nWait, enemy body is [(7, 7)].\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), they crash into their own body.\nIf enemy moves UP to (6, 8), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (6, 6), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), they are safe (I am vacating that spot).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 7): We swap. Safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and Enemy goes UP to (6, 8): We are adjacent. Safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), and Enemy goes DOWN to (6, 6): We are adjacent. Safe.\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n**UP (5, 8):**\n- Pros: Eats an apple (+1 score). Grows. Puts distance between me and enemy (1 tile gap vs 0 tile gap). Secures position.\n- Cons: None really.\n**RIGHT (6, 7):**\n- Pros: Aggressive. Closes distance. Potential to trap.\n- Cons: Puts me directly adjacent to enemy. If enemy survives this turn, next turn I might be in danger if I don't have an escape route. Also, I don't eat an apple this turn.\n\n**The Play:**\nI want the apple. (5, 8) is there. Taking it guarantees growth and score.\nIf I go UP, I am at (5, 8). My body will be [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)].\nThe enemy is at (6, 7) (moving to somewhere).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), they are next to me.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 7), they are next to me.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 6), they are away.\n\nLet's check the board state again. Row 8.\n`8 A . . T T A A . . .`\nIndex 5 is `.`.\nBut the list says (5, 8) is an apple.\nIf the map is accurate and (5, 8) is NOT an apple, then UP is just a move to an empty spot.\nBut I must trust the list provided in the prompt text. The list is the data.\n\"APPLE DROPS: ... (5, 8) ...\"\nSo (5, 8) is an apple.\n\nLet's double check the list again.\n(8, 1)\n(8, 2)\n(9, 4)\n(1, 3)\n(1, 6)\n(9, 1)\n(3, 1)\n(2, 3)\n(7, 9)\n(1, 4)\n(6, 8)\n(0, 5)\n(7, 4)\n**(5, 8)**\n(0, 8)\n\nYes, (5, 8) is an apple.\n\nSo I will go **UP**.\n\nWhy not **LEFT**?\nLeft to (4, 7). My body is at (4, 8) and (5, 7). (4, 7) is empty.\nBut going Left moves me away from the enemy and the apple cluster (5,8, 6,8). Passive.\n\nWhy not **DOWN**?\nDown to (5, 6). Empty. Safe. But no apple. Passive.\n\nSo the choice is between **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n**RIGHT** is risky. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), and I move RIGHT to (6, 7), we are neighbors.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), they might eat the apple at (6, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 7), I don't eat an apple.\nIf I move UP to (5, 8), I eat an apple.\nEating the apple is better than not eating it.\n\nIs there a scenario where UP kills me?\nIf the enemy moves into (5, 8) as well.\nThe enemy is at (6, 7). Can they reach (5, 8) in one move?\nDistance from (6, 7) to (5, 8) is Chebyshev distance 1. Manhattan distance 2.\nThey cannot reach (5, 8) in one move.\nSo (5, 8) is exclusively mine.\n\nTherefore, **UP** is the winning move.\n\nFinal Plan:\nMove UP to (5, 8) to eat the apple. Grow to length 4. Maintain the score lead. From (5, 8), look to trap the enemy on the next turn. If they move UP to (6, 8), we are neighbors. If they move LEFT to (5, 7), we are neighbors. I will have the length advantage.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nUP",

Let's break down the current battlefield. \ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **My Score:** 3 \ud83c\udf4e (LEAD CONFIRMED)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 2 \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **My Head:** (5, 8)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 8) \u2014 *Wait, did they just move UP?*\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(6, 7), (7, 7)]\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nOkay, let's look at the replay. In my last turn, I moved **UP** from (5, 7) to (5, 8) and ate the apple. \ud83c\udf4e That's why my body is showing (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8). My head is at (5, 8).\n\nNow look at the Enemy. In the replay, they were at (6, 7). Now they are at (6, 8).\nDid they move **UP**? Yes! They moved from (6, 7) to (6, 8).\nDid they eat an apple? The list shows an apple at (6, 8). They must have eaten it too. Their score is 2 (was 2 before? No, wait. Scoreboard says Enemy has 2 apples. Turn 4 they had 1. They ate one this turn. Correct.)\nSo they are at (6, 8), right next to me at (5, 8). We are touching! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI am at (5, 8). The Enemy is at (6, 8).

T T A A . . .` (Wait, the map in the prompt is generated based on the current state).\nLet's look at the list of apples again.\nApples left: (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 4), (1, 3), (1, 6), (9, 1), (3, 1), (2, 3), (7, 9), (1, 4), (0, 5), (7, 4), (0, 8), (0, 1), (2, 4).\n(5, 8) and (6, 8) are gone (we ate them).\nCheck the map visually for Row 8.\nThe map shows: `9 . . . . . . .

(But 6,7 is their body, so they can't go DOWN unless their tail moves? Wait. Enemy body is [(6, 7), (7, 7)].\n            *   Enemy Head (6, 8).\n            *   Neck (6, 7).\n            *   Tail (7, 7).\n            *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 7), they hit their own neck.

But the apple at (7, 9) is getting closer to the Enemy (currently at 6,8).\nIf I go UP to (5, 9), Enemy could go UP to (6, 9), grabbing the apple at (7, 9) potentially next turn.\nIf I stay passive, I lose momentum.\n\n**OPTION B: The Aggressive Route (RIGHT)**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 8).\nThis is risky but high reward.\nIf the Enemy moves LEFT to (5, 8) (my current spot):\n*   We collide. We both die.\n*   I have 3 apples. Enemy has 2.\n*   **I WIN THE ROUND.** \ud83c\udfc6\nIf the Enemy moves UP to (6, 9):\n*   I move to (6, 8). They move to (6, 9). We are adjacent. I am safe. I am now closer to the apple at (7, 9).\n*   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 9) and eat. \ud83c\udf4e\nIf the Enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 8):\n*   I move to (6, 8). They move to (7, 8). We are diagonal? No, (6,8) and (7,8) are adjacent.\n*   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 8)? No, they are there. I can go UP to (6, 9).\n*   If I go UP to (6, 9), I am next to apple (7, 9).\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have a higher score (3 vs 2).\nIf I move RIGHT and the Enemy moves LEFT, it's a head-on collision. I win.\nIf I move RIGHT and the Enemy moves UP or RIGHT, I gain position on the apple at (7, 9).\nIf I move UP, I give up the position and let the Enemy dictate the flow.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **RIGHT**.\nTarget: (6, 8).\nWhy? To contest the space. To threaten the head-on collision where I win. To close the gap to the apple at (7, 9).\nIf the Enemy is scared and moves UP to (6, 9), I take their previous spot (6, 8) and am perfectly positioned to snipe the apple at (7, 9) on the next turn.\nIf they fight, I win the tie-breaker.\nThis is the \"Box him in\" mentality. Don't let him breathe.\n\nCheck safety:\n(6, 8) is occupied by Enemy Head.\nSimultaneous move means if Enemy leaves, I occupy.\nIf Enemy stays, we collide (Head-on). I win tie-breaker.\nIf Enemy moves into my body? My body is (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8). (6, 8) is not in my body.\nIf Enemy moves into my head? That's the collision mentioned above.\n\nI am risking a draw (tie-breaker win) or securing position. Moving UP is passive. Moving RIGHT is dominant.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce the confrontation or outmaneuver him to (7, 9). Once I secure the lead (4-2), I can start walling him off. If he dodges, I eat the apple and keep the pressure on.\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT. Aggression.\n\nRIGHT",

From (6,9) we can grab it next turn by moving RIGHT, giving us a point and tying the score 3\u20113.  \n2. **Space management** \u2013 Moving UP puts us on the top row where we still have a clear escape to the right; we avoid crowding our own tail.  \n3. **Opponent pressure** \u2013 If the opponent chooses UP to (5,9) they\u2019ll sit right beside us, but they can\u2019t reach the (7,9) apple before we do. If they go LEFT, they drift away, giving us open control of the upper\u2011right quadrant.  \n4. **Future flexibility** \u2013 After taking the apple at (7,9) we\u2019ll be length\u202f4 and can start hemming the opponent into the lower\u2011left area where the next batch of apples lives.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n- **Turn\u202f5:** go **UP** to (6,9).  \n- **Turn\u202f6:** move **RIGHT** to (7,9) and eat the apple, tying the score.  \n- From then, use our increased length to loop around the opponent\u2019s corridor, pushing him toward the bottom\u2011left cluster of apples and setting up a possible head\u2011on when we hold the lead.\n\nLet\u2019s climb to the top and snag that apple! \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udeb1\n\nUP",
