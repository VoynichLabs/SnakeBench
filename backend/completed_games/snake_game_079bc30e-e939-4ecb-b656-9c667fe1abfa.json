There are no obstacles or enemy snakes in that immediate path.\n- Moving LEFT would go to (6,0): no immediate advantage.\n- Moving UP to (7,1): no immediate benefit; more distant apples are above.\n- Moving DOWN: not possible, since we're at y=0 and can't go further down.\n\nGiven this, the best move is to head directly toward the nearby apple at (8,0) to maximize early gain and avoid unnecessary risk.\n\nPotential risks:\n- The enemy snake at (8,4) is far above at (8,4), so no threat in this immediate move.\n- No obstacles or threats in the path to (8,0).\n\nPlanning for future moves:\n- After eating that apple, I can focus on other apples: notably (7,4) or (3,8), but prioritize nearby apples first.\n\nDecision:\n- Move RIGHT to (8,0) to consume the apple immediately.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
