Moving off the board (e.g., y=0 or y=10, x=0 or x=10).\n2. Moving into the enemy snake's body (but since the enemy has no body, this is irrelevant for now).\n3. Moving into your own body (irrelevant since no body).\n\nSince the enemy has no body, the only immediate threat is off the board. Let's check each direction:\n\n- **UP (y increases):**\n  - New head position: (2, 5)\n  - Check if (2, 5) is off the board: No (y=5 is valid).\n  - Check if (2, 5) is an apple: Yes! This is one of the apples at (2, 5).\n  - Safe move.\n\n- **DOWN (y decreases):**\n  - New head position: (2, 3)\n  - Check if (2, 3) is off the board: No.\n  - Check if (2, 3) is an apple: No (apple at (2, 5)).\n  - Safe move.\n\n- **LEFT (x decreases):**\n  - New head position: (1, 4)\n  - Check if (1, 4) is off the board: No.\n  - Check if (1, 4) is an apple: No.\n  - Safe move.\n\n- **RIGHT (x increases):**\n  - New head position: (3, 4)\n  - Check if (3, 4) is off the board: No.\n  - Check if (3, 4) is an apple: No.\n  - Safe move.\n\nAll four directions are safe. Now, we prioritize moves that:\n1. Eat an apple (preferred).\n2. Move toward apples (avoid moving away).\n3. Keep future options open (avoid dead-ends).\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Moves\n- **UP to (2, 5):** Eats the apple immediately. This is the best immediate win.\n- **DOWN to (2, 3):** Moves toward the next apple at (2, 5) but doesn't eat it yet.\n- **LEFT to (1, 4):** No apple nearby; moves away from the closest apple (2, 5).\n- **RIGHT to (3, 4):** No apple nearby; moves away from the closest apple (2, 5).\n\n### Step 3: Long-Term Strategy Note\n- **Short-term:** Eat the apple at (2, 5) immediately to gain points and grow.\n- **Mid-term:** After eating, the snake will have a body segment at (2, 4). Avoid moving into (2, 3) or (2, 5) next turn to prevent collisions.\n- **Enemy:** The enemy snake is at (1, 6) with no body. It will likely try to grow toward apples or avoid you. Monitor its position and possible moves.\n- **Apples:** The other apples are farther away, so focus on eating the closest one first.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe safest and most optimal move is **UP** to eat the apple at (2, 5).\n\nUP",
