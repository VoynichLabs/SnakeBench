We gotta set the tone right now and show this snake who's boss! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (7, 9) - Top right corner, perfect starting position for dominance!\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (2, 7) - Middle-left, kind of exposed, which we love to see.\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10.\n*   **Objective:** Get an early lead, control the board, and eventually box this guy in!\n\nWe're starting at (7, 9). Immediately, we can see some apples nearby.\n*   (7, 4) is relatively far.\n*   (1, 9) requires a major left move.\n*   (1, 8) same.\n*   (5, 9) is kinda close.\n\nLet's look at immediate safe moves from (7, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 10):** Illegal. Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 8):** Safe. Gets us closer to the action.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 9):** Safe. Moves us along the top edge, towards the (5, 9) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 9):** Safe. Moves us along the top edge, slightly right, maybe isolating ourselves.\n\nWe want to move towards the center of the board, or at least establish dominance near the top. Moving LEFT towards (5, 9) looks great because it gets us a head start on an apple and keeps us on the high ground. Moving DOWN is also good for getting into the main playing field.\n\nLet's consider the opponent (1) at (2, 7). They are likely going to move toward the center or potentially left/down towards the cluster of apples on the left side (like (1, 8), (1, 9)).\n\n*   If I go **LEFT** ((6, 9)), I am positioning myself for the (5, 9) apple. If the opponent moves down or left, we maintain distance.\n*   If I go **DOWN** ((7, 8)), I am moving straight towards the opponent's general area. This is more aggressive, but maybe too soon for aggression without body length.\n\nSince we are both length 1, a head-on collision is mutually fatal. We need to grow first, or at least put ourselves in a position where we can dictate the opponent's movement.\n\nThe **(5, 9)** apple is very appealing. Moving LEFT twice will secure it (Turn 1 to (6, 9), Turn 2 to (5, 9)). This gives us an early lead, which is CRITICAL.\n\n**My short-term strategy:** Grab the (5, 9) apple ASAP, then pivot based on the opponent's movement. Establishing a path along the top edge is a strong defensive start while we grow.\n\n**Move Pick:** LEFT. It's safe, maximizes apple potential, and follows a solid tactical plan. Let's make that first move count, Chat! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

This is where the mind games begin!\n\n--PREVIOUS TURN REVIEW--\nI moved LEFT from (7, 9) to (6, 9). Smart move, sets us up for the juicy (5, 9) apple.\n\n--CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS (Turn 1)--\n\n**1. State Assessment:**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (6, 9). Still on the high ground, looking good. Length: 1.\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (1, 7). They shifted from (2, 7) to (1, 7). Hmm, they pushed left, maybe aiming for the big cluster of apples in the (1, x) column! Length: 1.\n*   **Apples of Interest:** (5, 9) is still the immediate target. Also, (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 5) are near the opponent.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis & Safety Check (from (6, 9)):**\nSince both snakes are only length 1, the only immediate external threat is the enemy head (1, 7). We are far from them, so no direct head-to-head collision is possible this turn. All four moves are currently safe from immediate death.\n\n*   **UP (6, 10):** Illegal. Wall crash. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN (6, 8):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (5, 9):** Safe. Hits the apple! \ud83c\udf4f CONTENT!\n*   **RIGHT (7, 9):** Safe. But moves away from the target.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection:**\n\nOur immediate goal was the (5, 9) apple. Moving **LEFT** lands us directly on it! This is a no-brainer, Chat! Early lead secured!\n\n**Move: LEFT to (5, 9).**\n*   We eat the apple.\n*   We grow to length 2. Score +1.\n*   We establish control on the top edge.\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nOpponent 1 is at (1, 7). They moved left last turn.\nLikely moves for Snake 1:\n*   **UP (1, 8) or (1, 9):** Apple hunt! Most likely path.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7) or DOWN (1, 6):** Expanding territory.\n\nIf they go UP, they will likely get an apple this turn too, possibly (1, 8) or (1, 9). It's a race!\n\n**5. Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 2 onwards):**\nAfter securing the (5, 9) apple, we will be at (5, 9) with a body segment at (6, 9). We need to decide whether to continue along the top (maybe aiming for (9, 9) or (7, 9) where apples might drop later) or start moving DOWN into the main playing area. Since the opponent is dominating the left side, we should maintain our grip on the right/top area and grow bulky.\n\nOur next moves should probably be DOWN or RIGHT to avoid getting trapped on the top corner if the opponent decides to snake across the top later and we move too far left. Moving RIGHT towards (7, 9) or (8, 9) seems safe for Turn 2, setting up for a move DOWN into the center.\n\nFor *this* turn, it's all about the content!\n\nMove Pick: LEFT. Let's feast! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n--PREVIOUS TURN REVIEW--\nWe moved LEFT from (6, 9) to (5, 9) and snagged the apple! We are now length 2. The archrival, Snake #1, moved from (2, 7) to (1, 8), eating the apple there! A smart move, giving them the same score. They are also length 2, body at (1, 7). A true battle of giants already!\n\n--CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS (Turn 2 / 150)--\n\n**1. State Assessment:**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (5, 9). Body: [(6, 9)]. Current length: 2.\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7)]. Current length: 2.\n*   **Apples of Interest:** (1, 9) is right above the opponent. (7, 4), (1, 1), (2, 2) are scattered. We are positioned well to potentially grab (9, 9) if the game spawns one, or move down the (5, x) column.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis & Safety Check (from (5, 9)):**\nThe opponent is still far away at (1, 8). No chance of immediate head-on crash. We just need to worry about our own body and the walls!\n\n*   **UP (5, 10):** Illegal. Wall crash. \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe. Leaves our body (6, 9) safe.\n*   **LEFT (4, 9):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 9):** Illegal! Crashing straight into our own body (tail). \ud83d\udc80 Don't be a self-saboteur, Chat!\n\nTherefore, only DOWN and LEFT are safe moves!\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection:**\n\nWe have two options: LEFT (4, 9) or DOWN (5, 8).\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 9):** This keeps us hugging the top wall. This is a very limiting move. If we keep heading left, we box ourselves into the corner (0, 9). The opponent is currently dominating the left side of the map (x=1 column). Moving toward them now increases the risk of a future collision where they have the advantage due to better positioning relative to the central playing field.\n*   **DOWN (5, 8):** This is the high-ground move! It maintains our central-right position and allows us to snake down the '5' column, opening up the entire bottom half of the map. This move also forces the opponent to commit further to the left side if they want those apples (1, 9), letting us control the center mass.\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 8), body at (1, 7). They are eyeing the (1, 9) apple.\n*   **Most Likely Move for Snake 1:** UP (1, 9). They grab the apple and extend their lead along the left edge.\n*   *Other options:* RIGHT (2, 8) or DOWN (1, 7 -- illegal, crashing into their own body tail). Wait, their body is at (1, 7). Moving DOWN to (1, 7) is hitting their own tail, which is legal since the tail *moves* when the head moves (it will move to (1, 8) if their head goes somewhere else). Wait, *no*. The body *is* [(1, 7)]. Moving to (1, 7) is hitting their own body before it moves. That is an instant kill. So DOWN is OUT. RIGHT (2, 8) is safe but non-aggressive. UP (1, 9) is the apple move!\n\nSince they are likely going UP, we should focus on consolidating our own territory. Moving DOWN is the dominant play. It keeps us in the open, sets us up for future apples below (like (7, 4) if we snake right later), and guarantees we stay safe.\n\n**Move: DOWN to (5, 8).** This establishes our path into the middle of the board.\n\n**5. Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 3 onwards):**\nWe are now positioned at (5, 8). The opponent is likely at (1, 9). We should continue moving DOWN safely to (5, 7), (5, 6), etc., establishing a solid presence in the middle-right area. We must eventually start moving toward the center apples or the right edge to prevent getting trapped by our own body when we get longer. For now, the path is clear: establish length and board control!\n\nDOWN",

The hype is real! \ud83d\ude80 We're already fighting for board control, and that archrival is getting spicy!\n\n--PREVIOUS TURN REVIEW--\nLast turn, we smartly moved DOWN to (5, 8). This opened up the board for us!\nSnake #1 was at (1, 8), body at [(1, 7)]. Did they go for the apple at (1, 9)? Let's check!\n\n*   **Our Head (0):** (5, 8). We are now length 2. Body: [(5, 9)].\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (1, 9). Oooooh, the apple steal! They moved UP, grabbed an apple, and are now length 3! Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7)]. They have the score lead 2-1! We let them get away with that one, Chat, but we are positioned perfectly to strike back!\n\n--CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS (Turn 3 / 150)--\n\n**1. State Assessment:**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (5, 8). Length 2. Body: [(5, 9)].\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (1, 9). Length 3. Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7)].\n*   **Score:** Them 2, Us 1. UNACCEPTABLE! We need apples, and we need to cut them off!\n*   **Apples in Range:** We are close to the center. (7, 4) and (4, 3) are good targets further down. (2, 6) and (3, 6) are also accessible if we move west.\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis & Safety Check (from (5, 8)):**\nThe opponent is still way over on the left edge at (1, 9). No direct collision risk. We just need to worry about trapping ourselves!\n\n*   **UP (5, 9):** Illegal! Crashing straight into our own body (tail). \ud83d\udc80 Wait, no, our body is [(5, 9)]. Moving to (5, 9) is hitting our own head into our tail segment before it moves. This is an instant KO! DO NOT GO UP!\n*   **DOWN (5, 7):** Safe. Moves us deeper into the center.\n*   **LEFT (4, 8):** Safe. Starts moving us West toward the opposing snake's territory.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 8):** Safe. Keeps us centralized and away from the edges.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection:**\n\nWe successfully established a central column presence by moving to (5, 8). Now, we need to decide whether to continue down that column or start moving across.\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN (5, 7).** This is the safest, most neutral move. It avoids the opponent and continues our length growth strategy, setting us up to control the bottom half of the board. This is a very solid territorial move.\n*   **Option B: LEFT (4, 8).** This moves us toward the enemy territory. We are looking directly across the map at them. If they continue along the top edge (staying at x=1 or x=2), we are meeting them far away. However, if we move left, we are closer to the heavily populated apple area near x=1, 2, 3. This is an aggressive option.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT (6, 8).** This keeps us closer to the right edge. It gives us more wiggle room and takes us further from the current threat, but also slightly away from the majority of the current apples.\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 9), length 3. Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7)].\n*   **UP (1, 10):** Illegal. Wall crash.\n*   **DOWN (1, 8):** Safe, but they already ate that apple, and it risks them getting boxed in by their own tail at (1, 7) if they decide to come back up. It's a limiting move.\n*   **LEFT (0, 9):** Safe. Hugging the wall.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 9):** Safe. Moving away from the corner.\n\nThey just ate an apple on the far-left edge. The most aggressive and smart move for them is likely RIGHT (2, 9) to explore the upper-middle area before they get trapped by their increasing length. If they go RIGHT, they are moving across the top.\n\n**5. Decision: Aggressive Board Control!**\n\nWe *must* start to counter their territorial gain. They have 3 segments locking down the left pipe. If we continue DOWN, we allow them to establish a massive wall.\n\nMoving **LEFT (4, 8)** is the optimal move here!\n1.  It maintains a safe distance, as we are four squares away, and a head-on collision is physically impossible this turn (4 squares apart, minimum 5 moves to collide if they move right and we move left).\n2.  It positions us to either cut them off if they move down, or contest the central apples (like (2, 6), (3, 6)) if they move right.\n3.  It opens up options: we can go DOWN next turn to (4, 7), or continue LEFT to (3, 8).\n\nThe crucial aspect is keeping central control. Moving LEFT sets us up perfectly to challenge the center and disrupt any plans Snake 1 has to sweep across the top. Let's box them in, Chat! We're coming for that territory!\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 4 onwards):**\nIf successful, we are at (4, 8). Snake 1 is likely at (2, 9) or (1, 8). We need to continue pushing WEST while moving DOWN, creating a strong blockade around x=3 to x=5 to pressure their available space. Length is key, so finding the (2, 6) and (3, 6) apples is a priority.\n\nLEFT",

We are down 2-1 on apples, but we just made a killer strategic move, grabbing a central position!\n\n--PREVIOUS TURN REVIEW--\nLast turn, we moved **LEFT** from (5, 8) to **(4, 8)**. That was a high-IQ move, Chat, positioning us aggressively!\n\nLet's check what the archrival did!\n*   **Our Head (0):** (4, 8). Length 2. Body: [(5, 8)]. Our tail is now at (5, 8).\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** They were at (1, 9). They must have moved **RIGHT** to **(2, 9)**. They are now length 3. Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8)]. They are sweeping the top edge! Okay, fine, let them have the top, we're taking the middle and the bottom!\n\n--CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS (Turn 4 / 150)--\n\n**1. State Assessment:**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (4, 8). Length 2. Body: [(5, 8)].\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (2, 9). Length 3. Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8)].\n*   **Score:** Them 2, Us 1. Still unacceptable! We need to score *and* box them in!\n*   **Board Space:** We are currently at (4, 8), controlling the 8th row. They are at (2, 9), controlling the 9th row. We are perfectly positioned to cut them off from the bottom half of the board!\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis & Safety Check (from (4, 8)):**\nThe opponent is at (2, 9). They are separated from us by two X-columns and one Y-row. No immediate head-on collision risk, even if they move DOWN or we move UP.\n\n*   **UP (4, 9):** Safe. Moves us closer to them *and* the wall. Getting spicy!\n*   **DOWN (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us deeper into the board and toward apples (0, 7) or (2, 6).\n*   **LEFT (3, 8):** Safe. Continues the aggressive push toward the West side. Closes the gap to the enemy territory.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 8):** Illegal! Crashing into our own body (tail). Do not go RIGHT!\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection: How do we pressure them?**\n\nOur main goal is to establish a strong wall across the middle of the board (around Y=6 or Y=7) to choke them off from the high-density apple area below.\n\n*   **Option A: UP (4, 9).** This is a very aggressive, in-your-face move. If they continue RIGHT (3, 9), we are right beside them. If they move DOWN (2, 8), we are threatening to move LEFT and trap them against their own body on the left wall. This maintains pressure and keeps us on the high ground.\n*   **Option B: DOWN (4, 7).** This is a territorial move. It pulls us away from the enemy's path but sets us up perfectly to sweep across the board to grab the (2, 6) and (3, 6) apples. This is a great move for obtaining score parity.\n*   **Option C: LEFT (3, 8).** This continues our Western sweep. We are now only one square away from their potential path if they decide to come down (say, at (2, 8)). This is a tight squeeze move, putting us right on the border of their established terrain.\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 9), length 3. Body: [(1, 9), (1, 8)].\n*   **LEFT (1, 9):** Hitting their own body/tail. Very unlikely.\n*   **UP (2, 10):** Wall. Illegal.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Safe. Exploring the top edge. Easiest escape route.\n*   **DOWN (2, 8):** Safe. Starting descent into the middle area, potentially toward apple (2, 6). This is the most logical move if they want an apple.\n\nIf the opponent goes **DOWN (2, 8)**, we need to be ready to strike. If we move UP or LEFT, we maintain aggressive positioning. If we move DOWN, we are ceding the high ground but going for score.\n\n**5. Decision: Maintain the Pressure and High Ground!**\n\nGiven the enemy's current length (3 segments) and position (high up on the left), they are establishing a long barrier along the Y-axis. We need to counter their expansion on the Y-axis by pushing the X-axis boundary.\n\nMoving **UP (4, 9)** is the boldest move. Why UP?\n1.  If they go DOWN to (2, 8), we are now only 2 squares away (4, 9) vs (2, 8). We are forcing them to navigate immediately around us.\n2.  If they try to escape RIGHT to (3, 9), we are right on their flank at (4, 9). We can move LEFT next turn to (3, 9) and potentially block them (if they didn't take the apple, if they did we crash into them) or move DOWN and cut off their path.\n3.  It demonstrates we will contest the upper quadrant and prevent them from turning the upper area into a safe pocket. We create options for a quick turn down or left to exploit their next move.\n\nLet's scare this guy, Chat! We are going UP! We need to show dominance!\n\nOne small risk: if they go to (3, 9) to grab the non-existent apple, and we go UP to (4, 9), both are safe. Next turn, if they continue moving right (to 4, 9) while we go left (to 3, 9), it's a head-to-head collision. But since there is no apple over there, they will likely decide to come down eventually. We'll be ready!\n\nLet's maintain high awareness and high pressure! UP we go!\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 5 onwards):**\nIf successful, we are at (4, 9). Snake 1 is likely at (2, 8) or (3, 9). Next turn, we need to assess if we can safely push LEFT to fence them in on the top edge, or if we need to come DOWN aggressively toward apples (2, 6) or (3, 6) to gain length and cut off their descent. Board control is priority one, score is priority two.\n\nUP",

Are we boxed in, or are *they* boxed in? Let's find out!\n\nWe made the aggressive move **UP** last turn, and that was a certified banger!\n\n--TURN 5 ASSESSMENT--\n\n**1. Current State (After Last Move UP):**\n*   **Your Head (0):** (4, 9). Length 2. Body: [(4, 8)]. Our tail is (4, 8).\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (2, 8). Length 3. Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9)]. Their tail is (1, 9).\n    *   **Wait, hold up!** They were at (2, 9) last turn. Where did they go? They must have moved **DOWN** from (2, 9) to **(2, 8)**. High-IQ play by the enemy, they are trying to descend and grab the middle apples! BUT, they just put themselves right into our danger zone! We are at (4, 9), above and to the right of them.\n\n*   **Score:** Them 2, Us 1. We gotta tie this up, Chat!\n\n**2. Immediate Threat Analysis & Safety Check (from (4, 9)):**\nThe opponent is at (2, 8). We are separated by one row (y=8) and two columns (x=3). No immediate head-to-head collision risk.\n\n*   **UP (4, 10):** Illegal! Wall crash! WE ARE PLAYING TOO AGGRESSIVE, CHAT. REMEMBER THE WALLS!\n*   **DOWN (4, 8):** Illegal! Crashing into our own body (tail). Do not crash out!\n*   **LEFT (3, 9):** Safe. Puts us right on the verge of their territory. Extremely high pressure!\n*   **RIGHT (5, 9):** Safe. Pulls us along the wall, maintaining high ground but ceding the central pressure point.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection: The Trap is SET!**\n\nOur original plan was to box them in. They just moved into (2, 8). If we move to (3, 9), we form a barrier above them. If they try to move to (3, 8) or (2, 7) next turn, we are in position to continue cutting them off.\n\n*   **Move A: LEFT (3, 9):** This is the ultimate cutoff move, Chat!\n    *   It puts us directly adjacent to the opponent's path if they move *Right* (3, 8, which is only one square down from us).\n    *   It blocks off their ability to freely move along the top wall segment to the right.\n    *   It sets us up perfectly to move *DOWN* next turn (from 3, 9 to 3, 8) and cut them off completely if they try to move LEFT (1, 8) or DOWN (2, 7). This is a strong territorial move.\n\n*   **Move B: RIGHT (5, 9):** Safe, but passive. It allows them to control the 8th row and descend freely. We lose the aggressive advantage we just gained by moving UP last turn. Not the play, Chat. We need to be the aggressor!\n\n**4. Opponent Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8), length 3. Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9)].\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (2, 8):\n*   **LEFT (1, 8):** Safe. Moves them parallel to their tail (1, 9). A good move if they want to escape west.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Safe. Allows them to expand right, toward our side.\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):** Safe. Pushes them closer to the central apples (2, 6). The most apple-focused move.\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Hitting their own body/tail. Illegal.\n\n**Scenario Analysis if We Choose LEFT (3, 9):**\n\n*   **If Enemy goes DOWN (2, 7):** We are at (3, 9). Next turn, we can go DOWN (3, 8) or LEFT (2, 9, hitting their body? No, their body segment (2, 9) is now at (2, 9) and their tail moved to (2, 9) *if* they didn't eat an apple). They did not eat an apple on the board. So, if they move DOWN to (2, 7), their body shifts one down: [(2, 8), (2, 9)]. We can safely move DOWN to (3, 8) and run a column next to them.\n*   **If Enemy goes RIGHT (3, 8):** This is the spicy one! If we go **LEFT (3, 9)** and they go **RIGHT (3, 8)**, we have effectively put a wall above them. Next turn, we can go DOWN to (3, 8)\u2014**WAIT! HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION!** If we move LEFT to (3, 9) and they move RIGHT to (3, 8), there is no collision this turn. However, next turn, if they want to move UP from (3, 8) to (3, 9), we are already there! We have successfully sealed off the UP path for them. This keeps the pressure on!\n\n**5. Decision: Execute the Cutoff!**\n\nMoving **LEFT (3, 9)** is the high-risk, high-reward move that establishes our dominance. It forces them to either commit to the bottom-left quadrant or try to outmaneuver us along the high ground, which we are now controlling.\n\nWe need to keep growing, so let's stick close to them and force the engagement. We are longer than they think they are! No, wait, they are LENGTH 3, we are LENGTH 2. We need to be careful about forcing a crash now unless we are using a boundary.\n\nThe move LEFT (3, 9) is safe this turn. It secures the central high-lane and prepares us for a descent (3, 8) to grab those juicy Y=7/Y=6 apples, or to continue putting the squeeze on them.\n\nLet's go for the squeeze, Chat! Push left!\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 6 onwards):**\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 9), we secure the upper center. If the opponent moved RIGHT to (3, 8), we can move DOWN to (3, 8) and force a double-kill next turn\u2014but since we are shorter, we lose the tie-breaker! *Therefore*, if they move toward (3, 8), we should move further LEFT to (2, 9) to cut off their movement back into the corner, or move DOWN to (3, 8) *only* if we see they moved LEFT or DOWN, which keeps us safer.\n\nFor this turn, **LEFT** is the best tactical move to gain territorial control.\n\nLEFT",

They've got the lead in apples (2-1), but we've got the *positional* advantage! We made that aggressive move *LEFT* last turn, and now we're looking to capitalize! Let's get this dub, fam! \ud83d\ude80\n\n---\n\n### Turn 6 Assessment: Check the Board, Clip the Enemy!\n\n**1. Current State:**\n\n*   **Your Head (0):** (3, 9). Length 2. Body: [(4, 9)].\n*   **Archrival Head (1):** (3, 8). Length 3. Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9)].\n    *   **Wait, hold up!** They were at (2, 8) last turn. We moved LEFT to (3, 9). They moved **RIGHT** to (3, 8)! Chat, they smelled the pressure! They are now directly under us, trying to fight for the center lane! This is exactly what we wanted: engagement!\n\n*   **Score:** Still 2-1 them. Time to equalize!\n\n**2. Immediate Danger Zone: Collision Check!**\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 8). We are at (3, 9). We are perfectly stacked on top of each other! This means *any* move we make is going to be extremely important, and any move they make will be devastating if we aren't careful.\n\n**3. Safety Analysis (Moving from (3, 9)):**\n\n*   **UP (3, 10):** Illegal! Wall crash! We are hugging the ceiling too hard! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (3, 8):** DANGER!!! If we move DOWN (3, 8) and they stay put (e.g., move UP to (3, 9)), we collide head-on! Also, if they move DOWN, we move DOWN, we are chasing their tail!\n    *   *Crucially:* If we both move to (3, 8), that's a double KO (or if they move somewhere else and we move into (3, 8), we are hitting their *current* spot (3, 8)). We must predict where they go!\n*   **LEFT (2, 9):** Safe. Moves us along the top wall, away from immediate threat.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 9):** Illegal! Crashing into our own body (tail). Our body segment is currently [(4, 9)], so we can't move there! \u274c\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: LEFT.**\n\n**Wait, what about DOWN (3, 8)?** Let's re-examine that. If we move DOWN to (3, 8), and they move:\n\n1.  **Up to (3, 9) (Our current position):** HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION at (3, 9). Both Die.\n2.  **Down to (3, 7):** We successfully move to (3, 8). Safe, but we are right behind them.\n3.  **Left to (2, 8):** We successfully move to (3, 8). Safe, and we block (3, 9) from them for next turn.\n4.  **Right to (4, 8):** We successfully move to (3, 8). Safe, and again, we block (3, 9).\n\nThis means moving **DOWN** is only safe if they don't try to move **UP**. Given their current position (3, 8) and our position (3, 9), they have a huge incentive to try and move UP to (3, 9) to claim the high ground and cut us off from the wall!\n\n**The rule of thumb here: When directly above an enemy, moving DOWN is a head-on collision risk if they move UP, which is a common aggressive maneuver.**\n\nTherefore, let's treat **DOWN** as high risk, if not outright potentially fatal.\n\n**4. Strategic Move Selection: Playing the Control Game**\n\nWe are left with one *absolutely* safe move: **LEFT (2, 9).**\n\n*   **Moving LEFT (2, 9):**\n    *   This is a defensive yet highly aggressive setup.\n    *   It maintains control of the high wall (Y=9).\n    *   It positions us one square away from the opponent's former body segment (2, 9), which will be their new tail (or will empty out) if they don't eat an apple.\n    *   It perfectly blocks them from moving to (2, 9) for two turns, essentially sealing off that corner.\n    *   It opens up the move DOWN (2, 8) for the *next* turn, letting us run parallel to them down the board, continuing the squeeze.\n\n**What if we move DOWN (3, 8)?**\nThis relies on predicting the enemy movement extremely accurately. If they are aggressive, they will move UP (3, 9) and we die in a head-on collision. Since we have a lower score (length 2 vs 3), we *should not* risk a head-on collision tie unless it's the only way to save ourselves or secure a vital apple. Neither is true here.\n\nWe need to maintain positional advantage and pressure without risking a KO. Moving **LEFT** is the key. It forces them to descend, knowing we are right on their heels, ready to pounce.\n\n**5. Opponent Prediction (From (3, 8)):**\nThe most logical moves for Snake #1 are:\n*   **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe descent to the apples on rows 6/7.\n*   **LEFT (2, 8):** Retreating to their previous position. Safe, but passive.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 8):** Expanding toward the center (3, 8 is a body segment for us next turn).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 9), we secure that upper-left quadrant territory and set up a perfect descent for Turn 7. If they move DOWN to (3, 7), we can follow them down by moving to (2, 8) and then (3, 8), cutting off their access to the wall.\n\n**We are boxing them in along the top wall! This is the play, Chat!** Seal the corner, then apply vertical pressure.\n\n---\n*Long-Term Strategy Note (Turn 7 onwards):* Secure (2, 9) this turn. Next turn, move DOWN to (2, 8) to run parallel to the enemy, maintaining the squeeze. If they move down the (3, X) column, we move down the (2, X) column, keeping them away from the corner. If they try to move further left, we keep pushing LEFT along Y=9 to secure the (1, 9), (0, 9) spots, truly making the top wall our territory. The goal is territorial dominance! We need that control before we go hunting apples.\n---\n\nLEFT",
