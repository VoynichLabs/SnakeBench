Moving RIGHT gets me to (4, 1), which is just 2 cells away from it. This is a high-probability target for the next couple of moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 5). If I move UP to (3, 2), the enemy could potentially move DOWN toward me, but they're 3 cells away. Moving RIGHT keeps me away from direct conflict with the enemy's column.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 1) is the safest play because:\n1. It moves me closer to the (6, 1) apple (achievable in ~2 more moves)\n2. It avoids the potential collision risk with the enemy in the same column\n3. It keeps me on a clear path without body obstacles\n4. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue RIGHT to reach and consume the (6, 1) apple. After collecting it, reassess. The (4, 8) apple is only 1 cell to the right and relatively close vertically, so that becomes a natural next target. The enemy has tied apples with us (4-4), so staying aggressive and collecting apples quickly is critical.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm at (6, 1), so I need to move right 3 cells and down 1 cell.\n\n- RIGHT to (7, 1) moves me closer to (9, 0) and keeps good flexibility\n- DOWN to (6, 0) also moves toward (9, 0) and is equally viable\n\nGiven that I'm one step away horizontally and can easily secure the apple, RIGHT is the better choice as it directly moves toward the target apple while maintaining flexibility for the next move.\n\nThe enemy is far away at (3, 8), so no immediate collision threat.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter RIGHT to (7, 1), the next move should be RIGHT again to (8, 1), then DOWN to (8, 0), then RIGHT to (9, 0) to collect the apple. This will bring me to 6 apples with a 2-apple lead. After that, reassess the board and likely move toward (7, 9) or (4, 8) depending on the evolving board state.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy could move DOWN and collide with me. I should pivot LEFT to avoid this threat while keeping multiple options open for future moves. Moving LEFT to (1, 4) gives me space and allows me to either:\n- Go UP later toward apples at (0, 9) and (2, 9)\n- Go RIGHT toward apple at (7, 4)\n- Continue lateral exploration\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- This turn: Move LEFT to (1, 4) to avoid enemy collision risk\n- Next turn: Reassess enemy position and either go UP toward (0, 9) or RIGHT toward (7, 4)\n- Prioritize collecting apples while maintaining safe distance from enemy\n- The trailing score (7 vs 10) requires aggressive apple collection, but not at the cost of dying\n\nLEFT",
