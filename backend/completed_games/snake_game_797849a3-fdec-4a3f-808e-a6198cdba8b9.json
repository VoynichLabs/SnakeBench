It also doesn\u2019t set up a predictable head-on collision with the enemy head at (3,2) on this turn.\n- Therefore, LEFT is the safest and most strategic choice to progress toward an apple while preserving future options.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move toward the left edge to reach the apple at (0,2) efficiently, then continue collecting remaining apples while staying on the periphery to minimize risk of trapping against walls or colliding with the opponent.\n- Monitor the enemy head at (3,2) for potential head-on risks and adjust path to avoid simultaneous occupancy of the same cell.\n\nLEFT",

However, the enemy head at (6,8) can move RIGHT to (7,8) this turn, which would result in a head-on collision where both heads enter (7,8) and both die.\n\nAssessment and risk balance:\n- UP gets the apple immediately in the common-sense case where the enemy does not also move RIGHT.\n- If the enemy does move RIGHT and we both enter (7,8) and die on the same turn, the game ends immediately and the winner is decided by apples. We currently have 4 apples vs the enemy's 2, so a mutual-death collision would still give us the win. Thus the worst realistic outcome of taking UP (mutual death) is acceptable because it yields victory; the best outcome (enemy avoids the collision) gives us +1 apple and we remain alive with more apples and board control.\n- LEFT/RIGHT avoid that immediate apple and don't offer a safer guaranteed win condition; LEFT risks a different head-on collision with the enemy moving DOWN into (6,7). RIGHT is safe but slow and wastes the immediate contested apple.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Take the apple at (7,8) now (or force the win via mutual collision). If we survive and eat it, re-evaluate enemy movement and then pursue the nearest remaining apples while keeping open space (avoid getting trapped near the top-right corner and the enemy\u2019s body).\n\nUP",

Going LEFT to (4,4) on this turn gives a direct UP next turn to eat it. LEFT keeps more direct access into the x=4 column where other apples ((4,9) and (4,5)) lie and avoids drifting toward my own long body on the right edge.\n- UP is also safe, but it\u2019s slightly less direct to the x=4 apple and would move me closer to my own torso if I then turn right.
