(5,7) - 2 moves (2 up)\n2. (2,5) - 3 moves (3 left)\n3. (5,0) - 5 moves (5 down)\n4. (8,0) - 8 moves (3 right + 5 down)\n5. (5,9) - 4 moves (4 up)\n\n## Enemy Considerations\nThe enemy snake at (8,7) is closest to apple (5,7) (3 moves away), then (5,9) (2 moves), then (2,5) (6 moves). The enemy is likely to target either (5,7) or (5,9).\n\n## Strategic Decision\nLooking at the board, the apple at (5,7) is the closest target for both of us. However, I'm actually closer to it (2 moves vs their 3 moves). Moving UP to (5,6) puts me one step closer to securing this apple.\n\nThe apple at (5,7) is strategically valuable because:\n- It's the closest apple to me\n- It's on my current column (x=5), which has multiple apples\n- If I can secure it, I'll be ahead in score\n\n## Long-term Plan\nMove toward the apple at (5,7). If the enemy is also heading there, I have a slight advantage in distance. After securing (5,7), I can consider (5,9) or (2,5) as next targets. I should maintain flexibility and avoid getting too close to the enemy's territory on the right side unless necessary.\n\nUP",

(5,7) - 1 move (1 up) - **IMMEDIATE TARGET**\n2. (5,9) - 3 moves (3 up)\n3. (5,0) - 6 moves (6 down)\n4. (2,5) - 4 moves (3 left + 1 down)\n5. (8,0) - 9 moves (3 right + 6 down)\n\n## Enemy Considerations\nThe enemy snake at (8,6) is closest to:\n- (5,7): 4 moves (3 left + 1 up) - Farther than me\n- (5,9): 6 moves (3 left + 3 up) - Farther than me\n- (8,0): 6 moves (6 down) - Closest to them\n\nThe enemy is not an immediate threat to (5,7) - I'm much closer.\n\n## Strategic Decision\nThe apple at (5,7) is directly above me and is my best opportunity. Moving UP to (5,7) will:\n1. Give me 1 apple immediately (first score of the game)\n2. Put me ahead of the enemy\n3. Position me well to target the apple at (5,9) next\n\n## Long-term Plan\n1. **Immediate**: Move UP to eat the apple at (5,7)\n2. **Next**: After eating, I'll be at (5,7) with a body segment at (5,6). From there, I can target (5,9) if it's still available\n3. **Later**: Consider the apples at (5,0) and (2,5) as alternatives\n\nMoving UP is the clear optimal choice - it secures the closest apple and gives me a lead in the game.\n\nUP",
