My strategy from last turn worked exactly as planned - I'm now just one move away from the apple at (0, 1).\n\nLet me analyze my current options from (1, 1):\n- UP: (1, 2) - This would hit my own body since that's where my previous head position is, so I'd die\n- DOWN: (1, 0) - This would take me to the bottom edge, which is safe but moves me away from the apple\n- LEFT: (0, 1) - This is exactly where the apple is! Perfect move to collect it\n- RIGHT: (2, 1) - Empty space, safe, but moves away from the apple\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at position (5, 0) with body at [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. It's still in the bottom row but on the right side, so it's not threatening my immediate path to the apple.\n\nThis is exactly the situation I planned for! Moving LEFT to (0, 1) will:\n1. Collect the apple, giving me 1 point\n2. Make my snake grow by one segment\n3. Put me in the bottom-left corner, which is relatively safe\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to plan my next move carefully. From (0, 1), I'll have limited options due to being near the wall, but I can move UP along the left edge or RIGHT toward the center of the board.\n\nMy next targets after this apple should be:\n- The apple at (5, 1) which is in the same row\n- Then potentially (3, 4) or (8, 6) depending on where the enemy snake moves\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (0, 1), move RIGHT or UP to get away from the corner and position myself for the next apple at (5, 1). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movement pattern.\n\nLEFT"

The apple at (0, 0) in the bottom-left corner could be a good next target since it's isolated and the enemy snake seems focused on the right side of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue UP to (1, 8), then on the following turn move UP to (1, 9) to collect the apple. After that, consider heading toward the apple at (0, 0) or reassess based on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nUP"

I'm now at (3, 6) and the apple is at (3, 1), so I need to move down 5 more spaces to reach it.\n\n1. **DOWN to (3, 5)**: This continues my direct path toward the apple at (3, 1). This is exactly what I want to do - maintain the straight line approach.\n\n2. **LEFT to (2, 6)**: This would unnecessarily deviate from my optimal path to the apple.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 6)**: This would also move me away from the direct path and potentially closer to areas where the enemy snake might expand.\n\n**Enemy snake consideration:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 7) with a very long body. They're still well away from my column 3 path, and I don't see any immediate threat. They seem to be occupying the right side of the board, which gives me good space to operate on the left side.\n\n**Apple strategy:**\nThe apple at (3, 1) remains my prime target. I'm making excellent progress toward it with this direct approach. Once I get that apple, I can reassess and potentially go for the corner apples at (0, 0) and (1, 0) which are nearby.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (3, 5) is clearly the optimal choice. It maintains my direct efficient path to the apple and keeps me in safe territory away from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue the march down column 3 toward the apple at (3, 1). I'm now only 4 moves away from getting my first apple! Stay vigilant about the enemy snake's movements but maintain this direct approach as long as the path stays clear.\n\nDOWN"
