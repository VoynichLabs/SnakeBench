If snake #2 moves down, I would be able to safely proceed left, but if it moves right, that would block my path.\n\nYet, the threat of a block is still minor. Even in the worst case scenario where snake #2 moves to the right, I can still make a lower detour by going down one step then move left, hence allowing me to avoid hitting snake #2 then up to reach the target apple.\n\nThus, it would be strategic to move left despite the possible threat from snake #2.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

On the other hand, if it moves down, I should be able to safely proceed left and collect the apple at (3, 9).\n\nHowever, considering the snake #2's current position and bearing the game's rules in mind, I believe the optimum strategy would be to head up first.
