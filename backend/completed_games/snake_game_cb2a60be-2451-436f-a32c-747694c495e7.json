RIGHT (7, 5): Would hit the apple at (7,5) - SAFE AND BENEFICIAL\n\nAnalysis:\n- LEFT is deadly (would hit my own body).\n- UP and DOWN are safe but don't lead directly to apples.\n- RIGHT is the most beneficial as it would make me eat the apple at (7,5), growing my snake and increasing my score.\n- The enemy snake is currently moving toward the apple at (3,3), which is far from my current position.\n- After eating the apple at (7,5), I'll need to be cautious about the enemy snake's potential path and avoid getting trapped.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter moving right and eating the apple at (7,5), I'll be at (7,5). I should then consider moving toward the apple at (7,8) or (8,8). I'll need to be cautious about the enemy snake's potential path toward the apples at (7,8) or (8,8). I should also avoid moving into a position where I might get trapped by my own body or the enemy snake's body.\n\nRIGHT",
