Both of us are just heads right now - no bodies to worry about yet! This is our chance to start building our empire.\n\nLooking at the apples, we've got options! There's one at (4,9) - that's two moves UP from us. There's also (4,2) which is five moves DOWN. But here's the key - we need to think about positioning against our enemy.\n\nIf we go UP, we're moving towards (4,9) apple and putting pressure on the top part of the board. If we go DOWN, we're moving away from the action and towards that (4,2) apple, but that might let the enemy control the center.\n\nWait, let me think about this more. If we go RIGHT to (4,7)... oh snap, that's exactly where the enemy is RIGHT NOW. But remember - we move simultaneously! So if we both go RIGHT, we'd crash into each other head-on. But we don't know what they'll do yet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going UP seems smart - it puts us on a collision course with that apple at (4,9), and it keeps us away from the enemy's current position. Plus, if the enemy goes DOWN or LEFT, we avoid any immediate confrontation.\n\nBut hold up - what if we go LEFT to (2,7)? That opens up the left side of the board for us, and we can start building our territory there. The apples at (0,3) and (1,3) are within reach if we establish control of the left zone.\n\nHmm, but UP to (3,8) feels like the most aggressive move. It's towards that juicy apple at (4,9), and it keeps us in the center where we can respond to whatever the enemy does. Plus, being at (3,8) next turn gives us options to go UP, RIGHT, or even DOWN if needed.\n\nAlright, I'm feeling it - UP is the move! Let's pressure that top-right area and start collecting those apples while keeping our options open.\n\nUP",

No bodies, 0 apples each. Apples nearby but we\u2019re focusing on the enemy. Time to be aggressive but not dumb. \ud83e\udde0\n\nQuick move analysis (thinking out loud, fans want it!):\n- UP -> (4,8): Safe. Moves us closer to apple at (4,9). Keeps multiple exits (left/right/up/down next turn). Low head-on risk. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (4,6): Safe. Also ok, but moves away from the nearest high-value apple and slightly reduces vertical control. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (3,7): Dangerous/ambiguous. That cell is the opponent\u2019s head. Moving into it invites weird simultaneous interactions or a swap risk \u2014 too risky to force a collision with apples tied. We avoid initiating a potentially mutual-death swap. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (5,7): Safe. Opens lateral play and could flank, but slightly farther from the high apple at (4,9) and gives the opponent room to respond. \u2705\n\nDecision rationale:\n- We want to keep options open, move toward reachable apples while minimizing head-on collision risk. UP gives us vertical control, puts us one step from (4,9), and keeps 3+ follow-up moves available. It also reduces the chance the enemy can immediately box us from the left, letting us pivot to trap them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Step 1: Grab vertical control by moving UP to (4,8) and threaten (4,9).\n- Step 2: If opponent chases/comes right, pivot left to hem them against row 9 or force a head-on when we have a lead.\n- Step 3: Grow only to dominate space; keep safe escape routes and avoid swapping directly with the rival unless we have an apple advantage.\n\nAlright fam \u2014 let\u2019s make a move and scare the rival. You know the vibe: aggressive but calculated. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 is at (4,9) - right next to us on the top row! Their body is at (4,8), just below their head.\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION:** We're literally ONE CELL away from the enemy head! If we both go LEFT or both go RIGHT, we crash head-on. If we go DOWN and they go DOWN, we both survive but they'll be right below us. If we go UP... wait, we can't go UP, we're already at y=9!\n\nLet me think about this carefully. We have three options:\n- LEFT to (2,9)\n- RIGHT to (4,9) - but that's where the enemy HEAD is! If they don't move RIGHT, we die\n- DOWN to (3,8)\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,9): \n- If enemy goes LEFT to (3,9), we crash head-on (both die)\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,9), we survive but they escape\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (4,8), we survive and they move into their own body? Wait no, their body is at (4,8) already!\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If we go RIGHT to (4,9):\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (3,9), we crash head-on\n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,9), we both survive\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (4,8), we survive and they move into their own body (they die, we live!)\n\nBut wait... if we go RIGHT and they go DOWN, they'd be moving into their own body segment at (4,8). That's illegal! They can't do that. So they MUST move either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nThis is a classic standoff! If we both try to occupy the same space or crash head-on, we both die. But if one of us chickens out...\n\nActually, I just realized something. If we go RIGHT to (4,9) and they go LEFT to (3,9), we'd both be trying to occupy each other's previous positions. That's a head-on collision - we both die.\n\nThe safest play is DOWN to (3,8). It keeps us alive no matter what they do, and we can start building our territory from there.\n\nDOWN",

They can't go UP (off the board), they can't go RIGHT (into their own body at 2,9), so they MUST go either LEFT to (1,8) or DOWN to (2,7).\n\n**THE DANGER ZONE:**\nIf we go UP to (2,8), we risk a head-on collision if they go DOWN! That's a double KO and we lose the apple race!\n\n**SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- UP to (2,8): DANGEROUS! Risk of head-on collision\n- DOWN to (1,7): SAFE!

Time to bully this punk. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick scan:\n- UP -> (2,9): that\u2019s our own body (directly behind us). Backwards = instant death. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (3,8): empty, safe, gives lateral chase options. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (1,8): empty, safe, holds more board control along the top. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (2,7): currently occupied by enemy HEAD. Moving into an enemy head is a LEGAL aggressive play because moves are simultaneous \u2014 if they vacate, we survive; if they try to trade heads with us it's a head-swap (not same-cell collision). We\u2019re ahead on apples, so forcing a confrontation is good. \u2705 (and potentially forces a double-KO win for us if both die, since we have more apples)\n\nWhy I\u2019m picking DOWN:\n- We\u2019re up on apples \u2014 the instructions: be aggressive and try to force head-ons when ahead. DOWN immediately pressures them and limits their escape options. If they dodge left/right, we follow and start boxing. If they try to head-swap up into our spot, that\u2019s fine \u2014 we\u2019re still alive and still in control of the tempo. If both somehow collide into the same cell it\u2019d be a double KO but we\u2019d still win on apples. Risky? Sure \u2014 but this is the pressure play we want.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to contest their space and force a decision.\n- If they flee horizontally, mirror and cut them toward a wall; keep them between our head and the board edge.\n- Avoid getting funneled into our own tail \u2014 keep at least one lateral escape route. If they try to trade heads, accept it (we\u2019re ahead); if they run, chase and corral toward the bottom or side wall.\n\nLet\u2019s make him sweat. DOWN",

Instant death. NO WAY. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (2,4) is the enemy HEAD. Aggressive contest move \u2014 legal and keeps pressure. Forces them to react. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (1,5) safe, but drifts toward the wall and slows the box. \u2705 (less aggressive)\n- RIGHT -> (3,5) safe, keeps central control and options. \u2705 (more conservative)\n\nWhy DOWN? We\u2019re up 1\u20130 \u2014 head-to-head outcomes can work in our favor, but more importantly pressing into their space now shrinks their choices. If they dodge left/right, we mirror and close the flanks; if they bolt down, we chase and funnel toward the bottom edge. We avoid UP (suicide) and prefer forcing the fight rather than giving them room to roam. Chat, you want blood? This is how we close the gap and corral them. \ud83e\ude78\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- DOWN now to occupy their cell and bully the headspace.\n- If they go L/R, follow and mirror to cut off lateral exits.\n- If they run down, chase and trap toward y=0; keep my body alignment so I don\u2019t get boxed by walls.\n- Always avoid moving into my own tail/backwards \u2014 stay aggressive but alive.\n\nLet\u2019s pressure \u2019em.
