We should avoid moving towards that area to prevent collision.\n- The enemy snake occupies (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So moving left towards (6,8), then down, then left again to reach apples could be obstructed or risky.\n  \nPossible moves from current position (7,8):\n\n1. **UP (to 7,9)**:\n   - Safe, as (7,9) is empty.\n   - Moves us toward the top edge, closer to apples at (9,1), but that is to the far right and down.\n   - Good for safety and potential to explore rightward.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 8,8)**:\n   - Safe, but possibly less strategic now since moving right would bring the snake closer to the right boundary, near (9,8), but we have to reach apples at (9,1). The path would be longer and more risky.\n\n3. **DOWN (to 7,7)**:\n   - Current position is (7,8), moving down to (7,7), leads us downward, closer to (4,0) or (3,1) if we go left and down.\n   - But moving down may bring us into more open space or closer to enemy snake at (4,4).\n\n4. **LEFT (to 6,8)**:\n   - Moving left approaches the (4,4) apple, but that is near enemy snake, which occupies (4,4)-(4,6). Since (6,8) is farther from enemies, maybe a safe direction.\n\nConsidering safety and progressing toward other apples:\n\n- Moving UP seems safe and flexible to explore higher positions, possibly aligning us toward the apples at (4,0) or (3,1) if we then move downward.\n- Moving RIGHT seems less optimal at this moment.\n- Moving DOWN could be risky due to proximity to enemy snake and potentially less access to apples in the lower region.\n- Moving LEFT may be worth considering if we want to approach the (4,0) or (3,1) apples, but we must avoid the snake's occupied area.\n\n**Strategy:** \n\nI will choose to move UP, as it keeps us safe, maintains flexibility to move toward various apples later, and avoids immediate threat or dead-ends. Moving up also positions us better for potential downward movement next turn if we decide to pursue lower apples.\n\n**Next move:** UP"
