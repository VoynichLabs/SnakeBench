It also risks future self-collision as you swing around the body area near (7,7).\n- DOWN keeps you away from the left-side wall, preserves more escape routes on the right/top, and maintains flexibility to back off if an apple becomes reachable soon.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Stay on the right side of the board, avoid tightening loops, and push toward apples that appear reachable while keeping a wide escape margin.\n\nDOWN",
