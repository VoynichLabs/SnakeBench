No immediate danger from enemy head.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (7, 0), which is 2 cells to the right (x+1).\n- Other apples are farther away (e.g., (4, 1) is 1 cell up and 1 cell left, but not immediately reachable without risking collisions).\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Prioritize safety**: Since your snake is alone and has no body, you can safely grow toward the nearest apple without immediate risk.\n- **Move toward (7, 0)**: This is the most direct and safe path to an apple.\n- **Direction**: RIGHT (x+1).\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note:\n- **Next turn**: After eating (7, 0), your snake will grow to (6, 0) and (5, 0). The enemy snake will move, but it's unlikely to interfere immediately.\n- **Focus**: Continue expanding toward apples while avoiding enemy paths.
