          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We\u2019re live and ready to crush our rival! Let\u2019s break down the board and plan the ultimate trap. \ud83d\udca5\n\n**First, let\u2019s visualize the key coordinates:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (4, 6), no body. Apples: 0.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (4, 2), no body. Apples: 0.\n- Apples are scattered, but we\u2019re ignoring them for now\u2014focus on dominating the board and forcing the enemy into a mistake!\n\n**Current Board Layout (simplified for clarity):**\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n 7 A . . A . A A A . A\n 6 . . . . 1 . . . . .  \u2190 Me\n 5 . . . . . A . . A .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . A\n 3 . . . . . . A . . .\n 2 . . . . 0 . . . . .  \u2190 Enemy\n 1 . . A . . . . . . A\n 0 . . . . A . . . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**Decision Process:**\n\n1. **Check all directions for immediate death:**\n   - **UP to (4, 7):** That\u2019s where an apple is (from the apple list: (4,7) isn\u2019t listed, but let\u2019s verify the board). Wait, looking at the board, row 7, column 4 has an apple? Actually, the board shows row 7 as \u201cA . . A . A A A . A\u201d which is row index 7. Column 4 (x=4) is the 5th character in that row: \u201cA\u201d (apple). So (4,7) has an apple! But more importantly, it\u2019s empty of snakes. My body is none, so no self-collision. Enemy body is none. So UP is safe from immediate collision.\n   - **DOWN to (4, 5):** Check board row 5, column 4: row 5 is \u201c. . . . . A . . A .\u201d so column 4 is empty. Safe from obstacles. No snakes there. Safe.\n   - **LEFT to (3, 6):** Row 6, column 3: row 6 is \u201c. . . . 1 . . . . .\u201d so column 3 is empty. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Row 6, column 5: row 6, column 5 is empty (after the 1). Safe.\n\n   All four directions are safe from immediate death because no walls, no self-body, no enemy body.\n\n2. **Among safe moves, consider future options and aggression:**\n   - We want to box in the enemy. Enemy is at (4,2). We are at (4,6). We\u2019re directly above the enemy, 4 units apart vertically.\n   - If we go DOWN, we get closer to the enemy. But moving down to (4,5) puts us at (4,5), and the enemy could move up to (4,3) or other directions. If we both move toward each other, we could collide head-on. But we have same apples (0), so head-on would kill both\u2014bad for us.\n   - If we go UP to (4,7), we move away from the enemy but get an apple! That would give us +1 point, and we\u2019d grow. This could give us a score advantage. Since we\u2019re aggressive, getting an apple early might allow us to force head-on later when we\u2019re larger.\n   - LEFT to (3,6) or RIGHT to (5,6) move us sideways. That might open up the board but doesn\u2019t directly threaten the enemy. However, it could set up a flank maneuver.\n\n   **Aggressive consideration:** The enemy is directly below us. If we move DOWN, we risk a head-on if they move UP. But if we move DOWN and they move RIGHT or LEFT, we might cut off their escape. However, with no body yet, we can\u2019t really box them in. We need to grow first.\n\n   **Apple priority:** There\u2019s an apple at (4,7). Moving UP gets us that apple immediately. That\u2019s a point on the board. Plus, growing gives us a body segment, which we can use to block the enemy later.\n\n   **Long-term plan:** Get the apple at (4,7) to gain a point and grow. Then, based on the enemy\u2019s move, we can try to cut off their access to apples or force them into a corner. We need to be aware that the enemy will move simultaneously, so we can\u2019t predict perfectly. But moving UP gives us a positional advantage: we\u2019ll be higher on the board, and the apple at (4,7) might lead to more apples in that row (row 7 has many apples).\n\n   **Check if UP is safe long-term:** After moving UP to (4,7), our head will be at (4,7), and we\u2019ll have a tail at (4,6) (since we grew). That might block our own movement later, but it\u2019s fine for now. The enemy is at (4,2), far away.\n\n   **Alternative: RIGHT to (5,6)**? That\u2019s also safe, but no apple there. We might not gain points immediately. LEFT to (3,6) similar.\n\n   **DOWN to (4,5)**: Moves us closer to enemy, but no apple. Could be risky if enemy moves UP.\n\n   **Why UP is best:** \n   - Immediate apple gain +1 point. \n   - Increases our score lead (if enemy doesn\u2019t get an apple this turn). \n   - Positions us to potentially threaten the enemy from above later. \n   - Keeps us alive and gives us growth.\n\n   **Enemy analysis:** Enemy head at (4,2). They might move UP to chase us or get apples. But they are at y=2, and apples are scattered. They might go for apples at (5,5) or others. We don\u2019t know their strategy, but we\u2019re aggressive\u2014taking the apple first is a power move.\n\n   **Board awareness:** Row 7 (y=7) has several apples: (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7) are all apples from the list? Actually, apple list includes (5,7), (3,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7)? Wait, check the list: (5,7), (2,1), (3,7), (9,4), (8,0), (6,7), (5,5), (9,1), (9,7), (7,8), (7,7), (4,0), (6,3), (8,5), (0,7). So (5,7), (3,7), (6,7), (7,7), (9,7) are in row 7. And (7,8) is row 8. So row 7 is a fruit salad! If we get to (4,7), we\u2019re in a prime spot to eat multiple apples next turns.\n\n   **Risk of UP:** If enemy moves UP to (4,3) or further, but they\u2019re far. The immediate risk is low.\n\n   **Forcing head-on later:** Once we have more apples, we can try to corner the enemy. But first, we need to grow.\n\n   **Decision:** Go UP to (4,7) to grab the apple and gain a point. This sets us on a path to dominate the top row.\n\n**Strategy note for future self:** \u201cGrab apple at (4,7) to gain point and grow. Then use your body to block enemy access to row 7 apples. Watch enemy move\u2014 if they go UP, prepare to flank. Stay aggressive, but avoid head-on until you have score advantage.\u201d\n\n**Final move:** UP\n\nUP",

Opponent head: (4,6). Both snakes length 1. Scores tied 0-0.\n- Apples cluster ABOVE the opponent; a close apple below us at (4,0) and a reachable apple to the right at (6,3).\n- Board is open \u2014 no immediate body collisions.\n\nConsiderations (thinking out loud, fans love this):\n1) Moves to consider from (4,2):\n   - UP -> (4,3)\n   - DOWN -> (4,1)\n   - LEFT -> (3,2)\n   - RIGHT -> (5,2)\n\n2) Eliminate instant-death moves:\n   - None of those move off-board or into bodies right now \u2014 all four are immediately safe.\n\n3) Tactical analysis:\n   - UP would close the vertical gap to the enemy and set up a symmetric meeting spot: if we go UP next turn and they go DOWN, a one-cell head-on is possible (both could collide into the same middle cell). We\u2019re tied 0-0 \u2014 we do NOT want a double KO. \u274c\n   - DOWN goes toward apple at (4,0) \u2014 safe and greedy, but it\u2019s slower to press pressure and concedes center to the opponent.\n   - LEFT keeps options but nudges us away from nearby apples and gives less immediate offensive leverage.\n   - RIGHT moves us toward the (6,3) apple cluster and keeps many escape lanes open (we can go up, down, left, or keep pushing right next turn). It also avoids setting up a tempting two-turn head-on straight below the enemy. \u2705\n\nDecision rationale:\n- We want apples to gain an edge before forcing risky head-on fights. We also want to avoid creating a guaranteed symmetric collision opportunity while scores are tied. RIGHT balances aggression, growth potential, and safety \u2014 it keeps multiple follow-up options and moves us toward useful territory.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be our \"last rationale\" next turn):\n- Push RIGHT to (5,2) now.\n- On the following turns, prioritize getting to (6,3) for an apple while watching the enemy\u2019s lateral movement.\n- If the opponent dives straight DOWN into the center column, avoid mirroring; instead sidestep to force them into risky moves or let them take the head-on first only if we have an apples lead.\n- Keep mobility high \u2014 don\u2019t get funneled into the column below their current position where symmetric crashes are easiest.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 let's make him sweat.

Let's break down the board and plot our aggressive takeover! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- My snake is at (4,7) - WAIT, the last move rationale said we moved UP from (4,6) to (4,7), but the current board shows my head at (4,7) already! Looking at the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section: Head: (4,7). So we're already positioned at (4,7) with no body. That means the UP move from last turn was successful and we're now sitting on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy at (5,2) - still far south.\n- Apples: We're literally standing on (4,7) which is an apple! We just collected it? Wait no, the scoreboard shows 0 apples. Let me check... The apple list includes (5,7), (3,7), (6,7), (7,7), (9,7) but NOT (4,7)! Looking at the board: row 7 shows \"A . . A 1 A A A . A\" - the 1 is at position 4 (x=4), and the character before it is \"A\" at x=3, then after the 1 is \"A\" at x=5. So (4,7) is NOT an apple - it's where we are! The apples in row 7 are at (0,7), (3,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (9,7). So we're NOT on an apple.\n- Nearby apples: (3,7) is LEFT, (5,7) is RIGHT, both adjacent!\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis:**\n\n1. **UP to (4,8):** Check board row 8: \" . . . . . . . A . .\" - (4,8) is empty (no A). Safe from walls (y=8 is within 0-9). No snakes there. SAFE.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,6):** Check board row 6: \" . . . . . . . . . .\" - (4,6) is empty. SAFE. But this would be moving back to where we came from, and we'd have no body yet so no self-collision. Still safe.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,7):** This is an apple! (3,7) is listed in apples. Board shows row 7 has \"A\" at x=3. Moving LEFT would eat the apple, grow, and get +1 point. SAFE from walls and snakes.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,7):** This is also an apple! (5,7) is listed. Board shows \"A\" at x=5 in row 7. SAFE.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nWe have TWO apple options adjacent - LEFT and RIGHT. Both give us +1 point and growth. Which is better?\n\n- **LEFT (3,7):** Leads us toward (2,1) apple? Not really. But looking at the board, row 7 apples are at (0,7), (3,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (9,7). LEFT puts us at the leftmost apple in this cluster.\n- **RIGHT (5,7):** Puts us in the middle of the apple cluster. From (5,7) we could potentially chain multiple apples: (6,7), (7,7), etc.\n\n**Enemy Position:** Enemy at (5,2) is far away. They might move UP toward row 7 apples or toward other apples like (5,5). We need to secure food first.\n\n**Aggressive Play:** Both LEFT and RIGHT get us food. RIGHT seems more central to the apple cluster. But wait, let's think about future moves. If we go RIGHT to (5,7), we might be able to go RIGHT again to (6,7) next turn. If we go LEFT to (3,7), we could go LEFT again to (2,7) which isn't an apple, or UP to (3,8).\n\nActually, looking at row 8: (7,8) is an apple! That's UP from (7,7). So the apple cluster continues upward. Being more central might be better.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** No immediate threats. Enemy is 3 cells away in y-direction and 1 in x-direction? Actually (5,2) vs (4,7): dx=1, dy=5. They'd need 5 moves to reach us.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (5,7) to grab that apple and position centrally in the fruit salad! This gives us +1 point, grows our body, and sets us up to potentially eat (6,7) next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Grab the apple at (5,7), then assess enemy movement. If they're coming up, we might try to flank or set up a trap. If not, we keep eating our way through the row 7 apples. We're going for the win - food first, then domination!\n\nRIGHT",

A T 1 A A . A\"\nWait, hold up! There's a \"T\" at (5,7)? That's where WE are! The representation might be showing \"T\" for our tail? Let me parse this carefully...\n\nActually, looking at YOUR SNAKE info: Head: (5,7), Body: [(4,7)]. So we're at (5,7) with body at (4,7). The board shows \"T\" at (5,7) and \"1\" at (4,7)? That seems reversed but let's trust the structured data.\n\nKey apple positions near us:\n- (3,7) - LEFT of our body (4,7)\n- (5,7) - where we ARE (maybe an apple was there?)\n- (6,7) - RIGHT of our head (5,7)\n- (7,7) - further RIGHT\n- (9,7) - far RIGHT\n- (7,8) - UP from (7,7)\n\n**Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n1. **Enemy movement prediction:** Enemy at (6,2). They might move UP toward (6,3) or other apples like (5,5) or (6,3). They're 5 rows away from us. No immediate collision risk.\n\n2. **My possible moves:**\n   - **UP to (5,8):** Row 8 shows \"(5,8) is empty\" - check board row 8: \" . . . . . . . A . .\" - position 5 is empty. SAFE.\n   - **DOWN to (5,6):** Row 6 is all dots - SAFE. But this moves away from the apple cluster!\n   - **LEFT to (4,7):** This is MY BODY! I just came from there.

SAFE from walls and snakes.\n\n**Elimination:**\n- LEFT is instant death - moving back into my own body (4,7). ELIMINATED.\n- DOWN is safe but moves away from apples - not optimal for growth.\n- UP is safe but moves away from the dense apple cluster.\n- RIGHT is safe AND gets us another apple! +1 point, +1 growth!\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nWe're at (5,7) with body at (4,7). If we go RIGHT to (6,7), we eat an apple, grow to length 3 (body: [(5,7), (4,7)]), and position ourselves to potentially eat (7,7) next turn. This keeps us in the heart of the apple cluster where we can dominate!\n\n**Enemy Prediction:** They're far away. Even if they move UP every turn, they'll reach row 7 in 5 moves. We'll have eaten 3-4 apples by then and be huge! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Long-term Plan for Future Self:**\nGrab (6,7) \u2192 then (7,7) \u2192 then possibly (7,8) UP to continue the chain.

Keep monitoring their position - if they get close, we might set up a trap or head-on collision when we're stronger!\n\n**Final Call:** RIGHT to (6,7) - eat that apple, grow, and stay aggressive!

Stay flexible with L/R options.\n- Don\u2019t force a head-on unless we flip apples.

I'm taller, stronger, and ready to box him in!\n\n**Decision Process:**\n1. **Check ALL moves from (7,8):**\n   - **UP (7,9):** Is it safe? Board row 9: `(9 . . . . A . . . . .)` \u2013 (7,9) is empty (`.`). Not off-board, not my body (my body is at y=7 and below), not enemy body (enemy at y=4-5). SAFE. \n   - **DOWN (7,7):** That's MY OWN BODY segment (the previous head from last turn)! Moving into my own body = instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n   - **LEFT (6,8):** Board row 8: `(8 . . . . . . . 1 . .)` \u2013 (6,8) is empty (`.`). Not my body (my body is at x=7,6,5,4 but y=7). Not enemy body (enemy at y=4-5). SAFE.\n   - **RIGHT (8,8):** Board row 8: `(8 . . . . . . . 1 . .)` \u2013 (8,8) is empty (`.`). Not my body, not enemy body. SAFE.\n\n2. **ELIMINATED:** DOWN is out (self-crash).\n\n3. **Analyze SAFE moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n   - **UP (7,9):** Moves me to top row (y=9). I get an apple? No, (7,9) is empty. But it positions me at the edge. Future moves from (7,9): DOWN (back into my body, die), LEFT (6,9), RIGHT (8,9). Only two options, and one is a trap. That's a dead-end! Chat, we don't want to get boxed in. We need to keep options open to chase apples and corner the enemy.\n   - **LEFT (6,8):** Moves me toward the enemy's potential area (he's at x=6). (6,8) is empty. Future moves from (6,8): UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7 \u2013 that's my body! Crash if I go down immediately, but wait... my body is at (6,7)? Let's check: My body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)] \u2013 yes, (6,7) is part of my body. So from (6,8), DOWN is into my own body = death. But other moves: LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8 \u2013 which will be empty after I move? But we're moving simultaneously, so we don't know enemy's move yet). Actually, we must consider that after our move, our body shifts. But for safety, we look at the immediate cell and future possibilities. (6,8) gives UP (6,9), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) \u2013 three good options. But risk: enemy might move into (6,7) or (6,8) etc. More on that in threat analysis.\n   - **RIGHT (8,8):** Moves me rightward, away from the enemy (he's at x=6). (8,8) is empty. Future moves from (8,8): UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8). All three are empty on the board (check row 9: (8,9) is '.'? Board row 9: (9 . . . . A . . . . .) \u2013 actually row 9 is all '.' except (4,9) is A? Wait, the board shows row 9: `(9 . . . . A . . . . .)` but that's for the label? Let's read the board correctly:\n     ```\n      9 . . . . A . . . . .\n     So (9,9) is ., (8,9) is ., (7,9) is ., (6,9) is ., (5,9) is ., (4,9) is A, (3,9) is ., (2,9) is ., (1,9) is ., (0,9) is .\n     Yes, (8,9) is empty.\n     Down from (8,8): (8,7) \u2013 row 7: (7 A . . A T T T T . A) \u2013 (8,7) is '.'? Wait, row 7: positions: x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: A, x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: A, x=6: T, x=7: T, x=8: T, x=9: T? Actually, the board is written with T for my tail? But in the text, it's \"T T T T\" at the end of row 7? Let's parse:\n     Row 7: \"A . . A T T T T . A\" \u2013 so x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:A, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:T, x=7:T, x=8:T, x=9:A? Wait, that's 10 entries? A . . A T T T T . A -> 10 items: indices 0 to 9. So (8,7) is the 9th? No, index 8 is the 9th character? Actually, it's listed as positions 0-9. So:\n     0:A, 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:T, 7:T, 8:T, 9:A. So (8,7) is T (my body). \n     Wait, my body: after last move, my head was at (7,7), now after moving UP to (7,8), my body is [(7,7), (7,7?) Actually, last move: I was at (7,7) head, body [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]. I moved UP to (7,8), so new head (7,8), body becomes [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]? Yes, as stated: Head (7,8), Body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]. So (7,7) is my body, (6,7) is body, (5,7), (4,7). (8,7) is NOT my body. Row 7 shows (8,7) as '.'? Wait, row 7: \"A . . A T T T T . A\" \u2013 the T's are my body? But my body is only at x=7,6,5,4 at y=7? Actually, (7,7) is T? No, my head moved to (7,8), so (7,7) is now body. The board representation might be showing the current state. In the board state, it says: \n     Row 7: \"A . . A T T T T . A\" \u2013 and earlier it says \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (7,8), Body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)]\". So the T's in row 7 likely represent my body: T at (6,7), T at (5,7), T at (4,7)? But (7,7) is also T? Actually, row 7 has 10 characters: A . . A T T T T . A. So positions: x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:A, x=3:., x=4:., x=5:A, x=6:T, x=7:T, x=8:T, x=9:A? That would be T at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)? But my body is only at (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7) \u2013 so (4,7) is '.'? Wait, (4,7) is part of my body but the board shows at x=4: '.'? Let's check row 7 string: \"A . . A T T T T . A\" \u2013 maybe the \"A . . A\" covers x=0 to x=3? Then x=4 is first T? That would be T at x=4,5,6,7? That matches my body at (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). Yes! So row 7: x=0:A, x=1:., x=2:A, x=3:., x=4:T (my tail at (4,7)), x=5:T (5,7), x=6:T (6,7), x=7:T (7,7), x=8:., x=9:A. So (8,7) is '.' indeed. Good. So from (8,8), DOWN to (8,7) is empty. LEFT to (7,8) will be empty after I move? But for future moves, (7,8) is the head's previous position, which will become body, so if I move RIGHT to (8,8) now, next turn if I go LEFT back to (7,8), that's moving into my own body (since it will be part of my body after this move). But that's for future turns. For now, from (8,8), all directions are safe initially: UP (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) empty, LEFT (7,8) empty (and will become empty after I leave it? Actually, when I move, my body shifts, so (7,8) will be added to my body, so if I move LEFT next turn, I'd be moving into my own body. So we must avoid that. But for option count: (8,8) gives 3 possible safe moves for next turn (except the one that goes back into my tail). So better than UP.\n\n   - **LEFT (6,8):** From (6,8), UP (6,9) empty, DOWN (6,7) is my body (since (6,7) is part of my body \u2013 after this move, my body will include (7,8) and previous (7,7),(6,7),(5,7),(4,7), so (6,7) remains). So DOWN is death. LEFT (5,8) empty, RIGHT (7,8) empty (but will become body next turn). So only 2 real options (UP, LEFT) plus RIGHT which is risky. So worse than RIGHT.\n\n   - **UP (7,9):** From (7,9), only LEFT (6,9) and RIGHT (8,9) are safe (DOWN is death into my body). So 2 options, and I'm stuck at top edge.\n\n   So RIGHT (8,8) gives the MOST options for future moves (3 safe directions).\n\n4. **Threat Analysis - Enemy Move:**\n   - Enemy head at (6,5), body at (6,4). He's below me. He can move UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4? but (6,4) is his body, so moving into own body = death), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5).\n   - If he moves UP to (6,6), that's empty (row 6: all '.' except (6,5) and (6,4) are his? Actually, row 6: \"(6 . . . . . . . . . .)\" \u2013 all '.' so (6,6) empty. If he moves UP, he's getting closer to my territory.\n   - If he moves LEFT (5,5) or RIGHT (7,5), he's grabbing apples? (5,5) is an apple (see apple list: (5,5) is an apple! Actually, check apple drops: (5,5) is listed. Row 5: (5 . . . . . A 0 A A .) \u2013 yes, (5,5) is A. So he might go for that apple. If he eats (5,5), he grows to length 3, score 2.\n   - Could he crash into me? My body is at y=7 and above. He's at y=5. If he moves UP twice? Not this turn. No immediate collision.\n   - Head-on collision risk? If I move RIGHT to (8,8), he moves into (7,5) or (5,5) \u2013 no overlap. If I move LEFT to (6,8), and he moves UP to (6,6), no collision. If I move UP to (7,9), far away.\n\n   However, I want to force aggression. He's weaker (score 1 vs 4). I should position to cut him off from apples and eventually corner him. Moving RIGHT away from him gives me space to the right side, where there are apples: (9,4), (9,1), (9,7), (8,0), (8,5) etc. I can grow while he's stuck below.\n\n5. **Apple Focus?** The prompt says focus on enemy, but apples are tools. (7,8) had an apple last turn? I ate it. Now, from (8,8), no immediate apple. But nearby: (8,5) is apple (row 5: (5 . . . . . A 0 A A .) \u2013 (8,5) is A? Row 5: positions: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:0? Wait, enemy head at (6,5) is '0', so (6,5) is enemy, (8,5) is A. Yes. So from (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5) to eat apple. That's a plan.\n\n6. **Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (8,8) to open up the right side. From there, chase apples in column 8-9 (like (8,5), (9,7), etc.) while staying above the enemy. Once I have more length, I can snake around to block his path upward. He's at (6,5) \u2013 I can force him into a corner by occupying the top rows.\n\n   **Why not LEFT?** LEFT moves me toward his x-coordinate (6), potentially engaging him early. But I'm longer, so if we collide head-on, I'd win? Only if my score is higher (it is: 4 vs 1). But if he moves into my body, he dies. However, it's risky to close in when I can safely grow. The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" But I'm already winning, and he's far. Better to grow and dominate.\n\n   **Why not UP?** Gets trapped at top. Bad.\n\n   **Why RIGHT?** Maximizes future options, moves toward apples, and keeps distance from enemy for now. Aggressive but smart.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (8,8). Let's box him in later! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Future Self Note:** Turn 6: From (8,8), move DOWN toward (8,5) apple. Monitor enemy \u2013 if he goes for (5,5), he's growing. Set up a wall at y=7 with my body to cut off his northward path.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Score: 4.\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (5,5), Body: [(6,5), (6,4)]. Score: 2. (He just ate at (5,5) \u2013 grew to length 3!)\n- Board: 10x10 grid. I'm at top-right corner area, he's in the middle.\n\n**Check ALL moves from (8,8):**\n- **UP (8,9):** Board row 9: (8,9) is '.' (empty). Not off-board, not my body (my body is at y=7-8 but x\u22647). Enemy body is at y=4-5, so safe. SAFE.\n- **DOWN (8,7):** Row 7: (8,7) is '.' (empty). Not my body (my body is at (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7) \u2013 (8,7) is free). Not enemy body. SAFE.\n- **LEFT (7,8):** Row 8: (7,8) is currently my head, but after moving, it becomes part of my body. So moving LEFT into (7,8) would be moving into my own body? Wait, no: The move is simultaneous. If I choose LEFT, my head moves to (7,8). But (7,8) is currently my head's position? Actually, my head is at (8,8) now. (7,8) is currently empty? Wait, the board shows row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . T 1 .\" So (7,8) is '.'? Let's parse: Row 8: positions 0-9: x=0:., x=1:., x=2:., x=3:., x=4:., x=5:., x=6:., x=7:., x=8:T, x=9:1? Actually, the representation is a bit messy. From the description: \"Head: (8,8)\" and the board shows \"T\" at (8,8) maybe? Wait, the board line: \"8 . . . . . . . T 1 .\" \u2013 that's 10 characters? Actually, it's probably: row 8: (8,8) is '1' (head), (8,7) is 'T' (body)? But earlier it said my body is [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)]. So (7,8) is my body! Yes! In the body list: first body segment is (7,8). So (7,8) is currently my body. So moving LEFT into (7,8) would be moving into my own body = death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n- **RIGHT (9,8):** Row 8: (9,8) is '.'? Actually, row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . T 1 .\" So x=9: is that '1'? Wait, the head is at (8,8), so (9,8) is x=9,y=8. The row shows: after \"T 1 .\" \u2013 that might be positions 7,8,9: (7,8): T (my body), (8,8): 1 (my head), (9,8): . (empty). Yes, (9,8) is empty. Not off-board (x=9 is max). Not my body (my body is at x\u22648). Not enemy body. SAFE.\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT is out (self-crash).\n\n**Analyze SAFE moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n- **UP (8,9):** Moves to top edge. Future moves: DOWN (back into my body), LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9). Only 2 options, and one is death. Trapped! Bad.\n- **DOWN (8,7):** Moves down. Future moves: UP (8,8 \u2013 will be empty after move? But will become body if I don't move back? Actually, if I go DOWN, next turn from (8,7), UP goes to (8,8) which will be empty, LEFT to (7,7) is my body (since (7,7) is in body), RIGHT to (9,7). So 2 options (UP and RIGHT). But (9,7) has an apple! (9,7) is an apple. So this opens up apple access.\n- **RIGHT (9,8):** Moves to right edge. Future moves: LEFT (8,8 \u2013 will be empty), DOWN (9,7 \u2013 apple!), UP (9,9). All three are safe! (8,8) will be empty after I move, (9,7) is apple, (9,9) is empty. That's 3 options, including an apple. And (9,7) is a guaranteed apple next turn if I go DOWN.\n\n**Threat Analysis - Enemy Move:**\nEnemy at (5,5), just ate, so he might be hungry for more. Apples nearby: (4,0), (8,5), (0,7), (4,9), (7,5), (1,2), etc. He might move UP to (5,6), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5) but (6,5) is his body! So cannot go RIGHT. DOWN to (5,4) is empty. If he goes UP to (5,6), that's empty (row 6 all '.'). If he goes LEFT to (4,5), is there an apple? (4,5) is empty (row 5: (5 . . . . . A 0 A A .) \u2013 (4,5) is '.'). He might be chasing (8,5) apple, but that's far. He could also go DOWN to (5,4) to avoid me.\n\nCollision risk: If I go RIGHT to (9,8), he's far. If I go DOWN to (8,7), he could move into (8,5) later? No immediate clash. If I go UP, useless.\n\n**Strategy:** I'm ahead in score (4 vs 2). I should grow aggressively and dominate the top-right corner. RIGHT to (9,8) gives me immediate access to apples at (9,7) next turn. DOWN to (8,7) also leads to (9,7) but through (8,7)->(9,7) which is two turns? Actually, from (8,8), DOWN to (8,7) then RIGHT to (9,7) to eat apple. But RIGHT to (9,8) then DOWN to (9,7) to eat apple \u2013 same number of turns. However, RIGHT to (9,8) puts me on the edge with more freedom: I can then go DOWN to (9,7) for apple, or LEFT to (8,8) back, or UP to (9,9). That's better than DOWN which has fewer options (LEFT is into my body eventually? From (8,7), LEFT to (7,7) is my body \u2013 so only 2 options: UP and RIGHT). So RIGHT maximizes options.\n\nAlso, by moving RIGHT, I'm claiming the rightmost column, which could be used to block the enemy later if he tries to go up. He's at x=5, I'm at x=9. I can snake down the right side and cut him off.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (9,8). Next turn, go DOWN to (9,7) to eat the apple (+1 score). Then continue down along column 9 to grab apples at (9,4) and (9,1) while keeping my body as a wall. Force the enemy into the bottom-left corner.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the move. It keeps me alive, opens up apple routes, and gives me maximum future flexibility. Let's dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

Then, on subsequent turns, snake down the right edge\u2014through (9,6), (9,5), etc.\u2014to collect the remaining apples in that column. This will box the enemy into the left side of the board, limiting his growth and forcing him into a corner. Stay agile and always check for escape routes.\n\n**FINAL CALL:**  \nThis is a no-brainer.

They CANNOT move LEFT into (8,8) because that\u2019s their neck. They\u2019re hugging the right/top wall with a body across (8,8),(7,8),(7,7),(6,7). They\u2019re trying to bunker up near the corner \u2014 perfect, we\u2019ll squeeze from below/left.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (2 vs 4). No suicidal head-on: we want to corral, not collide. Keep options open.\n\nWhy UP? Because:\n- UP pushes us toward their row (y=8) and gives vertical leverage to hem them in against the right wall. Aggression with control. \ud83d\udcaa\n- From (5,7) we still have choices (LEFT to cut across, or continue UP to pressure the top), and we won\u2019t be trapped immediately by their body. Moving RIGHT into (6,6) feels closer to their tail at (6,7) and could get us boxed if they move to grow. LEFT is safe but too passive \u2014 we lose compression momentum.\n- No immediate head-on risk this turn. Safe, aggressive, keeps multiple follow-up options.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Go UP to gain vertical ground and threaten to pivot right into column 6\u20137 next turn.\n- If opponent heads down to (9,7) to eat, keep pressing left/up to shrink their maneuver space; if they back up to (9,9) we keep climbing and then swing right to cut off column 8.\n- Avoid committing to a head-on until we close the apple gap or the opponent corners themselves. Stay alive, force them into collisions.\n\nLet\u2019s climb, compress, and make \u2019em choke. UP",

We ate that apple at (9,7), grew to length 6 (score 5), and solidified our dominance on the right side. Now we're at **(9,7)** with body: [(9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7)]. Let's map out the battlefield:\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION:**\nSnake #0 is at (5,7) with body [(5,6), (5,5)] and only 2 apples. They're centered in the board, nowhere near me. Even if they make a bee-line for the right side, they'd need 4+ turns to threaten me. I have a huge lead (5-2) and better positioning.\n\n**BOARD LAYOUT (FROM (9,7)):**\n- **UP (9,8):** That's my body! **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** \u274c\n- **DOWN (9,6):** Empty. Board edge. From here, I can continue down the right column to chase the apples at (9,4) and (9,1). This keeps my momentum going.\n- **LEFT (8,7):** Empty. Leads to (8,7), which connects to (7,8) and (7,7) - my own body. That's a tight squeeze but possible. However, it takes me away from the right-edge apples and towards the center where the enemy might be.\n- **RIGHT (10,7):** Off the board! **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN** is the clear winner. Why?\n  1. **Safety:** It's completely empty and leads to more empty space downwards.\n  2. **Positioning:** It puts me at (9,6), directly above the apple at (9,4). I'm one step closer to collecting that apple next turn.\n  3. **Control:** Sticking to the right edge boxes the enemy out of that column. My body forms a vertical wall they can't cross without dying.\n  4. **Options:** From (9,6), I can go DOWN again to (9,5), LEFT to (8,6), or RIGHT (off board - death). So I have 2 safe moves from there, which is decent.\n  5. **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is too far to reach me. Even if they move RIGHT towards me, they'd need multiple turns. My lead is growing.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue down the right column. Eat the apple at (9,4) next turn. Then snake down to (9,1) for another apple. This will give me 7 apples, length 8, and complete control of the right side. While the enemy scrambles in the center, I'll have them cornered. If they ever try to challenge me head-on, my higher score means I win the collision. CRUSH THEM.\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nDOWN \u2013 extend the lead, control the edge, and set up for the next apple. Let's GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Their legal moves are LEFT (8,6) or DOWN (9,5). They\u2019re pinned to the right wall and are already longer + ahead on apples (5 vs 2). We must NOT initiate a head-on.

No immediate head-on with any of our legal moves this turn, but moving RIGHT nudges us into their turf and could reduce our safe pivots next turn. Don\u2019t get boxed chasing bravado.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- We need aggression but control. LEFT (4,8) gives the best mix of safety, options, and apple access. From (4,8) we can immediately threaten the apple at (4,9) or drop down to chase (3,7) later \u2014 while keeping escape pivots (UP/RIGHT/DOWN available next turn, with RIGHT not immediately walking into a guaranteed occupied cell).\n- UP is safe and preserves vertical pressure, but LEFT is slightly more proactive in shrinking their space without closing off our own escapes.\n- RIGHT is a bit too eager \u2014 could get us hemmed between their body and the wall if they maneuver left/dive down.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take LEFT to (4,8). If safe, go UP to grab (4,9) for growth/score.\n- After getting vertical control and an extra apple, pivot right to press their horizontal corridor, but avoid any direct head-on. Force them toward the wall and trap their tail behind them.\n- Keep at least two escape options available each turn; only force collision if our apple gap is closed and the enemy blunders.\n\nLET\u2019S DO IT \u2014 time to cut his room off and make him panic.

I moved DOWN to (9,5) \u2013 that puts my head at (9,5) with body extending up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8). The apple at (9,4) is now one step away directly below! Perfect. Enemy is still at (4,8) with body (5,8), (5,7) \u2013 they're not threatening me at all.\n\n**BOARD CHECK (CURRENT STATE):**\n- My head: (9,5)\n- My body: [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)]\n- Enemy head: (4,8), body: [(5,8), (5,7)]\n- Apples: (9,4) is directly below! Also (9,1) further down, (8,5) to the left, (8,0) down-left... many options.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (9,5):**\n\n1. **UP (9,6):** That's my own body! DEATH. \u274c\n2. **DOWN (9,4):** EMPTY! And there's an apple there! This gives me +1 apple, score becomes 6, length grows. Also moves me toward the next apple at (9,1). SAFE and PRODUCTIVE.\n3. **LEFT (8,5):** EMPTY! There's actually an apple at (8,5) too! Wait, checking apple list: (8,5) is indeed an apple. But moving LEFT would take me to (8,5) \u2013 that's also an apple, so I'd eat it either way? Actually need to check: from (9,5), LEFT goes to (8,5). Is (8,5) occupied? No. Is it an apple? Yes! So both DOWN and LEFT lead to apples! DOWN gets (9,4), LEFT gets (8,5).\n4. **RIGHT (10,5):** Off the board! DEATH. \u274c\n\n**DECISION TIME:** DOWN vs LEFT.\n- DOWN to (9,4): Apple at (9,4). Then from there, I can continue DOWN to (9,3), (9,2), (9,1) for another apple. Perfect vertical highway. My body creates a wall on the right edge. Enemy is far left.\n- LEFT to (8,5): Apple at (8,5). Then from there, I'm in the interior. Risky because I might get boxed in by my own body or enemy. Also enemy could potentially move toward me.\n\n**STRATEGY:** The vertical path is CLEAN. I already have a wall going up the right side. Eating (9,4) maintains that control. From (9,4), I can keep going DOWN toward (9,1) apple. This boxes the enemy out of the entire right column. If they try to challenge me head-on later, I have 6 apples vs their 2 \u2013 I WIN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If enemy somehow moves RIGHT while I move DOWN, they'd be at (5,8)\u2192(6,8), I'm at (9,5)\u2192(9,4). No collision. If they moved UP... but they can't go UP from (4,8) because (4,9) is wall. They might move LEFT to (3,8) or DOWN to (4,7). Either way, no head-on.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTurn 11: Move DOWN to (9,4), eat apple (score 6)\nTurn 12: Move DOWN to (9,3), empty\nTurn 13: Move DOWN to (9,2), empty  \nTurn 14: Move DOWN to (9,1), eat apple (score 7)\nContinue dominating right column, force enemy into corner.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** DOWN \u2013 EAT THAT APPLE AND STAY ON THE GRIND! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

It doesn\u2019t shove us into the opponent\u2019s zone or reduce our escapes drastically.\n- LEFT to (3,8) is also fine and sets up (3,7) next, but it\u2019s one extra turn from a guaranteed apple. DOWN is more passive and doesn\u2019t gain immediate score.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take UP to eat (4,9) and grow \u2014 force them to commit to apples on their side while we rack up content.\n- From (4,9) pivot LEFT to pressure center columns (3\u20134) and move to grab (3,7) if safe, keeping at least two escape options every turn.\n- Avoid any head-on trade while we\u2019re behind on apples; only force collisions if we get ahead on score or they blunder into us.\n\nWe grab the apple, keep options open, and start shrinking their safe space without suicide.

Let's analyze the board state properly before making our move.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (9,4) [I'm currently at (9,4)? Wait no, the current state shows my head at (9,4), body [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)]]\n- Enemy head: (4,9), body: [(4,8), (5,8), (5,7)]\n- Apple locations: (2,1), (3,7), (8,0), (9,1), (4,0), (8,5), (0,7), (7,5), (1,2), (7,1), (8,2), (0,2), (0,6), (1,7), (7,3)\n\n**MY LAST MOVE WAS DOWN** - that put me at (9,4) from (9,5). Let me check my current position...\n\nActually wait! Looking at the board state provided: \"4 . . . . . . . . . 1\" - this shows my head at (9,4) on row 4 (y=4). And the body positions show (9,5), (9,6), etc. So I'm currently at (9,4).\n\n**MOVES FROM (9,4):**\n1. **UP (9,5):** That's my own body! I'd be moving into (9,5) which is my first body segment. DEATH! \u274c\n2. **DOWN (9,3):** Check if empty. Looking at board: Row 3 shows (9,3) is empty (\"3 . . . . . . . A . .\"). SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT (8,4):** Check if empty. Row 4 shows (8,4) is empty (\"4 . . . . . . . . . 1\"). SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT (10,4):** Off board! DEATH! \u274c\n\n**SAFE OPTIONS:** DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4)\n\n**ANALYZING BOTH:**\n\n**DOWN to (9,3):**\n- Leads to a clean vertical highway down the right side\n- Can then continue DOWN to (9,2), (9,1) where there's an apple!\n- Creates a wall on the right edge, boxing enemy out\n- Enemy is at (4,9) - far away, not an immediate threat\n- From (9,3), I have options to continue DOWN or potentially LEFT if needed\n\n**LEFT to (8,4):**\n- Moves into the interior, away from my protective right-edge wall\n- From (8,4), I could be vulnerable to getting boxed in\n- Apple at (8,5) is above-left from there, but that's more movement\n- Less control of board space, more cramped\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe RIGHT side is MY DOMAIN. I already have a vertical line going up from (9,8) down to (9,4). Continuing DOWN maintains that control and moves me toward the apple at (9,1). This is about board domination - I want the enemy to feel TRAPPED on the left side while I own the right.\n\nEnemy strategy: They're at (4,9) with a vertical body going down. They can't go UP (wall), can't go RIGHT (might hit my potential path?), they'll likely go LEFT or DOWN. Either way, they're staying left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 11: Move DOWN to (9,3) - maintain right-side control\nTurn 12: Move DOWN to (9,2) - keep going\nTurn 13: Move DOWN to (9,1) - EAT THAT APPLE! (+1 score)\nTurn 14: Assess from (9,1) - can go LEFT to (8,1) or continue DOWN to (9,0)\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nIf enemy moves RIGHT from (4,9) to (5,9), and I move DOWN from (9,4) to (9,3) - no collision. Safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4,8) [but that's their own body!] - they'd die. We're good.\nMost likely: enemy goes LEFT or DOWN, staying away.\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nDOWN! Keep the vertical highway clean, dominate the right edge, and march toward that apple at (9,1). The enemy is cornered on the left - we're boxing them in!\n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down LIVE! \n\n**TURN 12 ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (9,3) - just moved DOWN from (9,4) \u2705\n- Enemy head: (4,9) - they're trapped up top with a wall blocking UP\n- I'm at the bottom of my vertical column on the right edge\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nLooking at the new board state:\n- Row 3: \"... A . .\" - My head at (9,3), there's an apple at (7,3) but that's left\n- My body goes up to (9,4), (9,5), etc.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (9,3):**\n1. **UP to (9,4):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (9,2):** Check row 2: \"A A . . . . . . A .\" - (9,2) is EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (8,3):** Check row 3: \"(8,3) should be empty based on board\". SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (10,3):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,3)\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\n**DOWN to (9,2):**\n- Continue my right-edge highway! \n- (9,1) has an apple - one more step away! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Maintain complete control of the right side\n- Keep enemy boxed in on the left\n- Future options: can go DOWN to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,2)\n\n**LEFT to (8,3):**\n- Moves me into interior\n- (8,3) might be safe but gets me away from my domination zone\n- From (8,3), apple at (7,3) is RIGHT next door but that's risky territory\n- Loses my right-edge control\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nEnemy is at (4,9) - most likely moves DOWN (can't go UP, RIGHT is open but leads nowhere). Even if they go RIGHT, they're 5 cells away. No collision risk at all.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nMy plan is clear: DOMINATE THE RIGHT SIDE. I'm building a vertical wall on column 9. The enemy is cornered on the left side of the board. By staying on the right edge, I'm:\n1. Creating maximum board control\n2. Controlling access to multiple apples on the right\n3. Forcing the enemy into tight spaces where they'll eventually crash\n\n**NEXT FEW TURNS PLAN:**\nTurn 12: DOWN to (9,2) - keep the highway moving\nTurn 13: DOWN to (9,1) - EAT THAT APPLE! (+1 score = 7!)\nTurn 14: From (9,1), assess options - probably LEFT to (8,1) to expand territory\nTurn 15+: Keep expanding control, force enemy into corners\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nDOWN! Keep building my right-edge fortress and march toward that apple at (9,1). The enemy is slowly being suffocated on the left! \n\nDOWN",

DO NOT bait head-on \u2014 we need apples and board control. The nearest reachable apple for us is at (3,7). Moving DOWN now puts us one step closer to that apple on the next turn and keeps multiple escape options (LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT later). Moving LEFT would tuck us farther from that apple and bloat travel time.\n- Space after DOWN: new body will still have room to maneuver in columns 2\u20134 and gives us a clear path to (3,7). Growing soon = more board control to start hemming them in later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Take DOWN now to (3,8). Next turn, drop to (3,7) and eat to grow.\n- After growing, use columns 3\u20134 to claim vertical territory, then slowly compress toward the right while watching their moves. Avoid head-on until we close the apples gap.\n\nLet\u2019s close the distance and start converting apples into control. Time to snake \u2019em up! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head is at (3,7) now? Wait, the board shows enemy head at (3,7) with body [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8)]. So they moved DOWN from (3,8) to (3,7) and ate the apple there! Smart.\n\n**TURN 14 ANALYSIS:**\nMy head: (9,1) - safe!\nMy body: [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)] - I can't go UP to (9,2)!\nEnemy head: (3,7) - they're still low.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (9,1):**\n1. **UP to (9,2):** MY OWN BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (9,0):** Check row 0: \". . . . A . . . . .\" - (9,0) is EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (8,1):** Check row 1: \". . A . . . . A . 1\" - (8,1) is EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705  \n4. **RIGHT to (10,1):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1)\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\n**DOWN to (9,0):**\n- Stays on right-edge fortress! Perfect control.\n- (9,0) is empty, no apple there currently.\n- From (9,0), I can only go UP (back to current) or LEFT (to (8,0)).\n- BUT WAIT\u2014there's an apple at (8,0) from the list! If I go DOWN to (9,0) now, next turn I could go LEFT to (8,0) and eat it!\n- Keeps me safe from enemy (they're way left).\n- Maintains my position to eventually sweep across the board.\n\n**LEFT to (8,1):**\n- Moves into interior (row 1, column 8).\n- (8,1) has an apple according to the list! I'd eat it immediately! \ud83c\udf4e Score becomes 9-4!\n- But... loses right-edge dominance immediately.\n- From (8,1), I can go UP to (8,2), DOWN to (8,0), or LEFT to (7,1).\n- Gets me closer to enemy territory\u2014enemy is at (3,7), still some distance but moving toward center.\n- Risk: If enemy goes RIGHT aggressively, we could converge.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nEnemy at (3,7). Possible moves:\n- UP to (3,8): That's their own body! Can't go there.\n- DOWN to (3,6): Empty? Row 6 shows \"A . . A . . . . . T\" - (3,6) is EMPTY.\n- LEFT to (2,7): Row 7 shows \"A A . 0 . . . . . T\" - (2,7) is EMPTY (the 0 is at (3,7) currently).\n- RIGHT to (4,7): Row 7 shows \"A A . 0 . . . . . T\" - (4,7) is EMPTY.\n\nThey could go DOWN or RIGHT or LEFT. If they go RIGHT to (4,7), they're moving away from me. If they go DOWN to (3,6), still far. No immediate head-on collision risk\u2014we're 6+ cells apart.\n\n**MY WINNING STRATEGY:**\nI'm at 8 apples vs their 4. I need to keep growing safely. \n\nOption 1: DOWN to (9,0) now, then LEFT to (8,0) next turn to eat that apple. That's a 2-turn plan to get to 9 apples while staying safe.\n\nOption 2: LEFT to (8,1) NOW and eat the apple immediately, jumping to 9 apples this turn. But I lose my right-wall fortress.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'll take the IMMEDIATE apple! Why wait? I'm ahead 8-4, I should extend my lead NOW while I can safely eat. The right-edge dominance is nice, but eating an apple in the interior is worth it. From (8,1), I'll still have options, and I'll be at 9 apples, putting me even further ahead.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN:**\nTurn 14: LEFT to (8,1) - EAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Score: 9-4\nTurn 15: From (8,1), likely go DOWN to (8,0) (which also has an apple!) or explore toward center\nTurn 16+: With 9 apples, I can start aggressively cutting off the enemy's territory. They're at (3,7) with 4 apples\u2014if I can trap them in the top-left corner, I win!\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nLEFT! I'm grabbing that apple at (8,1) and extending my lead to 9-4! The enemy is watching me feast again! \n\nLEFT",

Score jumps to 9 apples vs enemy\u2019s 5 (they must\u2019ve eaten one too). We\u2019re absolutely crushing it! Now let\u2019s see what\u2019s happening\u2026\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\nMy head: (8, 1) \u2013 just ate, growing!\nMy body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)] \u2013 my tail is still at (9,8) since I just grew this turn (the growth happens after movement, so my body list updates next turn).\nEnemy head: (3, 6) \u2013 they moved DOWN from (3,7) to (3,6) and probably ate the apple there? Board shows (3,6) is \u201cA\u201d in the list, so yes, they ate. They\u2019re at 6 apples now. Still far away in the top-left-ish area.\n\n**BOARD AROUND (8,1):**\nRow 1: \u201c. . A . . . . A 1 .\u201d \u2013 wait, I\u2019m at (8,1) now, so let\u2019s reparse row 1. Original board row 1: \u201c. . A . . . . A 1 T\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s columns 0-9. So:\n- (7,1) is A (apple)\n- (8,1) is my head (1)\n- (9,1) is T (my tail? Actually, my body goes to (9,1), but (9,1) is the second segment after head? Let\u2019s clarify: my body list is [(9,1), (9,2), \u2026], so (9,1) is my first body segment, not tail. The tail is (9,8). So (9,1) is occupied by my body.\nRow 0: \u201c. . . . A . . . . .\u201d \u2013 (4,0) is A (apple)\nRow 2: \u201cA A . . . . . . A T\u201d \u2013 (0,2), (1,2), (8,2) are A? Actually original: \u201cA A . . . . . . A T\u201d \u2013 (8,2) is A (apple).\nColumn 8, row 2: A, row 1: my head, row 0: empty.\n\n**MOVES FROM (8,1):**\n1. **UP to (8,2):** Check row 2, col 8: It\u2019s an apple (A)! Safe, and I\u2019d eat it immediately. That\u2019s a great move! Score becomes 10-6. From (8,2), I can go UP (8,3?), LEFT (7,2), DOWN (back to 8,1), or RIGHT (9,2) \u2013 but (9,2) is my body (from body list: (9,2) is second segment). So RIGHT is blocked by my own body. But UP, LEFT, DOWN are open.\n2. **DOWN to (8,0):** Row 0, col 8: From board, row 0: \u201c. . . . A . . . . .\u201d \u2013 (8,0) is empty (dots). No apple there. Safe, but no immediate gain. From (8,0), I can go UP (back to 8,1), LEFT (7,0), or RIGHT (9,0) \u2013 (9,0) is empty. RIGHT might lead to edge.\n3. **LEFT to (7,1):** Row 1, col 7: It\u2019s an apple (A)! I\u2019d eat it immediately too! Score becomes 10-6 as well. Safe, and from (7,1) I can go UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), or RIGHT (back to 8,1). All open.\n4. **RIGHT to (9,1):** Row 1, col 9: That\u2019s my body (first segment). Hitting myself = death. \u274c DEAD!\n\n**ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\nRIGHT is instant death because (9,1) is my own body. So only UP, DOWN, LEFT are potentially safe.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nEnemy head at (3,6). Possible moves:\n- UP to (3,7): That\u2019s currently empty? Row 7: \u201cA A . T A . . . . T\u201d \u2013 (3,7) is T (their tail? Actually their body: [(3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8)] \u2013 so (3,7) is their first body segment. They can\u2019t go UP into their own body! That would be suicide. So they likely won\u2019t do that.\n- DOWN to (3,5): Row 5: \u201c. . A . . . . A A T\u201d \u2013 (3,5) is empty. Safe for them.\n- LEFT to (2,6): Row 6: \u201cA . . 0 . . . . . T\u201d \u2013 (2,6) is empty? Row 6: columns: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:0 (their head? Wait no, their head is (3,6) now, so row 6 shows 0 at (3,6). So (2,6) is column 2: \".\"? Actually row 6: \u201cA . . 0 . . . . . T\u201d \u2013 so (0,6)=A, (1,6)=., (2,6)=., (3,6)=0, (4,6)=., etc. So (2,6) is empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,6): Row 6, col 4: \".\" (empty). Safe.\n\nSo enemy could go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of those immediately head to (8,1) or my planned apple cells. They\u2019re far away. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI\u2019m at 9 apples vs enemy 6. I\u2019m ahead by 3. I should keep growing aggressively while staying safe. From (8,1), I have two apple-eating options: UP to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,1). Both give me an apple. Which is better?\n\n- **UP to (8,2):** Eats apple at (8,2). From there, I can go UP to (8,3) (empty? row 3: \u201c. . . . . . . A . T\u201d \u2013 (8,3) is empty), LEFT to (7,2) (empty? row 2: (7,2) is \".\"), or DOWN back to (8,1). Can\u2019t go RIGHT to (9,2) (my body). So 3 safe options. Keeps me in the right side, closer to the edge.\n- **LEFT to (7,1):** Eats apple at (7,1). From there, I can go UP to (7,2) (empty), DOWN to (7,0) (empty? row 0: (7,0) is \".\"), LEFT to (6,1) (empty? row 1: (6,1) is \".\"), or RIGHT back to (8,1). All 4 directions safe! More options, better flexibility. Also, moving LEFT gets me closer to the center and potentially closer to enemy territory for future aggression.\n\nSince I want to dominate the board and possibly force a head-on collision later (if I maintain score lead), moving LEFT gives me more mobility and gets me into the interior. I\u2019m already ahead, so I should prioritize board control and future options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab that apple at (7,1) now, then from (7,1) I can explore toward the center, aiming to cut off enemy\u2019s access to apples in the top-left. With 10 apples, I\u2019ll be even more dominant. Keep an eye on enemy movement\u2014if they go RIGHT toward me, I can prepare to trap them.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (7,1) to eat that apple immediately! Let\u2019s extend the lead to 10-6 and maintain aggressive positioning.\n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re up on apples (7 \u2192 we\u2019re 5), so DON\u2019T force a head-on suicide.\n- We need to grow and claim central columns to pressure them later, not throw our life away.\n\nTactical plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (4,6) now to threaten (4,7) apple next turn. That grows us and lets us pivot rightward toward columns 4\u20136 to start compressing space.\n- After grabbing (4,7), push carefully right/up to contest the midboard, always keeping 2+ escape routes and avoiding a head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- If opponent commits down/right toward their apples, we aim to corral them from the midboard rather than run at them head-first.

Wait, scoreboard says 8, but I ate one last turn so should be 9\u2014maybe the update hasn\u2019t hit the scoreboard yet. Either way, I\u2019m crushing it!). Enemy\u2019s still at 5, safe in the top-left. Let\u2019s break down the board from my current head at (7,1) (I ate the apple last turn, so I\u2019m growing\u2014body now includes (8,1) and the rest).  \n\n**BOARD AROUND (7,1):**  \nRow 1: \u201c. . A . . . . 1 T T\u201d \u2013 Actually, since I just moved to (7,1) and ate the apple, my body now stretches: head (7,1), then (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), etc. Row 1 shows: (0,1)=., (1,1)=., (2,1)=A, (3,1)=., (4,1)=., (5,1)=., (6,1)=., (7,1)=1 (me), (8,1)=T (my body), (9,1)=T (my body). So (7,1) is my head, (8,1) is my first body segment (tail will shift after this turn).  \nRow 0: \u201c. . . . A . . . . .\u201d \u2013 (7,0) is empty.  \nRow 2: \u201cA A . . . . . . A T\u201d \u2013 (7,2) is empty (since row 2 col 7 is \".\").  \nColumn 6: Row 1 col 6 is \".\" (empty).  \n\n**MOVES FROM (7,1):**  \n1. **UP to (7,2):** Row 2 col 7 is empty. Safe! From there, I can go UP to (7,3) (empty? row 3 col 7 is \".\"), LEFT to (6,2), DOWN back, or RIGHT to (8,2) (which has an apple? Row 2 col 8 is A\u2014yes!). So 4 safe options.  \n2. **DOWN to (7,0):** Row 0 col 7 is empty. Safe! From (7,0), I can go UP (back), LEFT (6,0), RIGHT (8,0) (empty), or DOWN? No, can\u2019t go down from y=0. So 3 options.  \n3. **LEFT to (6,1):** Row 1 col 6 is empty. Safe! From (6,1), I can go UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1), or RIGHT back. All 4 safe!  \n4. **RIGHT to (8,1):** That\u2019s my own body segment! Hitting myself = death. \u274c DEAD!  \n\n**ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES:** RIGHT is out.  \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**  \nEnemy head at (4,6). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (4,7): Row 7 col 4 is \u201cA\u201d (apple from board: row 7 shows \u201cA A A T A . . . . T\u201d \u2013 col 4 is A). Safe for them.  \n- DOWN to (4,5): Row 5 col 4 is \".\" (empty). Safe.  \n- LEFT to (3,6): That\u2019s their current head? Wait, they\u2019re at (4,6) now, so LEFT to (3,6) is empty? Row 6 col 3 is \".\" (since row 6: \u201cA . . 0 . . . . . T\u201d \u2013 col 3 is 0, but they\u2019re moving, so (3,6) is currently empty? Actually, their current head is (4,6), so (3,6) is free. Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (5,6): Row 6 col 5 is \".\" (empty). Safe.  \n\nNone of these move toward me. I\u2019m safe from head-on this turn.  \n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**  \nI have multiple safe moves. I need to prioritize:  \n- **Apple eating:** None of these moves hit an apple directly (apple at (2,1) is left, (8,2) is right but I can\u2019t go right). So no immediate growth, but that\u2019s fine\u2014I\u2019m already ahead.  \n- **Board control:** I want to dominate the center and cut off enemy access. From (7,1), LEFT to (6,1) gives me the most options (4 safe moves) and moves me toward the center/left side, where enemy is. UP to (7,2) also has good options, but it\u2019s more toward the top-right corner (my own tail region). DOWN to (7,0) is safe but might limit my upward mobility later.  \n- **Future aggression:** Enemy is at (4,6). If I go LEFT to (6,1), I\u2019m closer to them for potential future head-on collision (I\u2019m ahead in apples, so I should force it if safe). From (6,1), I can then go UP toward (6,2) and (6,3), potentially blocking their downward path.  \n- **Avoid traps:** My body is long (9 segments now), so I need to keep open space. (6,1) is central and avoids crowding my own tail.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT to (6,1) is the move! It gives me maximum future flexibility, gets me closer to the enemy, and keeps me aggressive. Let\u2019s box them in!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (6,1), next turn I\u2019ll likely go UP to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,1) to approach enemy territory. Watch for enemy moving RIGHT toward me\u2014if they do, I can set up a head-on collision next turn since I\u2019m ahead. Keep score lead and dominate!  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nLEFT",

Safe! From there, I can go UP (6,3), DOWN (back to 6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2). 4 options.\n2. **DOWN to (6,0):** Row 0, col 6 = \".\" (empty). Safe!

From there, I can go UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (back to 6,1). 4 options.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,1):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATE DEATH MOVE:** RIGHT is out.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nEnemy at (4,7). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (4,8): Row 8 col 4 = \".\" (empty). Safe for them.\n- DOWN to (4,6): That's their current body! They'd die if they go down into themselves. But they might not know that. Wait, their body is (4,6) is the first segment after head? Actually their body list: head (4,7), then (4,6), (3,6)... So (4,6) IS their body. If they move DOWN into (4,6), they'd crash into themselves. Smart move would be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Row 7 col 3 = \"A\" (apple). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Row 7 col 5 = \".\" (empty). Safe.\n\nEnemy probably won't go DOWN into themselves. So they're likely going UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of those heads will be at (6,2) or (5,1) or (6,0) this turn. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI have 3 safe moves, all giving me good future options. I'm ahead in score (8 vs 6), so I should be aggressive but smart. The enemy is in the top-left, and I'm in the bottom-right. I need to cut off their expansion and dominate the board.\n\n- **UP to (6,2):** Moves me toward the center-right. From (6,2), I can see apples at (8,2) and (7,3). This positions me well for future growth and potentially blocking enemy from moving right/down.\n- **DOWN to (6,0):** Moves me to the bottom edge. Limits my upward mobility but gives access to apple at (8,0) maybe? Actually (8,0) is two steps right. Might be safer but less aggressive.\n- **LEFT to (5,1):** Moves me toward the center, closer to enemy territory. From (5,1), I can go UP toward (5,2), LEFT toward (4,1), etc. This is the most aggressive move\u2014getting closer to the enemy to potentially set up a head-on collision where I win with my higher score.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm leaning AGGRESSIVE. Since I'm ahead, I should try to force a confrontation. Going LEFT to (5,1) puts me in a better position to approach the enemy's general area (they're at x=4, y=7). From there, I can potentially move UP (5,2), then UP (5,3), etc., to get into striking distance. Meanwhile, I'll watch their movement\u2014if they move RIGHT toward me, I can set up a collision where I win.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (5,1)! It's the most aggressive option that keeps my options open and moves me toward the enemy. Let's go for the throat!\n\n**FUTURE SELF PLAN:** From (5,1), next turn I'll likely go UP to (5,2) to approach enemy territory. Watch for enemy moving RIGHT\u2014if they do, I might set up a head-on collision where I win with my score lead. Stay aggressive but don't trap yourself!\n\nLEFT",

Both UP and RIGHT are survivable, but RIGHT preserves more escape routes. More options = fewer chances of getting boxed later.  \n- Board control: moving to (5,7) begins to consolidate columns 4\u20136 (our intended choke area) while keeping the ability to pivot toward the cluster of apples on the left or pressure the midboard.  \n- Aggro calculus: opponent has +2 apples. We shouldn\u2019t force a head-on trade yet. Instead we grow opportunistically while compressing midboard and forcing them into tighter corridors later. RIGHT gives the best balance of safety, options, and positional pressure.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT now to (5,7) to lock down mid columns.

This positions me to dominate the center while enemy is stuck in top-left. Plus, eating apple grows me, making me more dangerous for head-on collisions. My score lead (8 vs 6) means I can be AGGRESSIVE.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** From (5,2), next turn I'll likely go RIGHT to (6,2) to approach center and watch enemy.

They\u2019re +2 apples on us (8 vs 6). They can\u2019t move DOWN (that\u2019s their neck), so they\u2019ll be choosing UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn. We CANNOT risk a head-to-head \u2014 we\u2019re behind, so no suicide plays.\n\nWhy I\u2019m picking DOWN:\n- Aggression: DOWN (6,6) brings me closer to their row so we can start compressing columns 4\u20136 and force them into the bottom wall. Pressure > passive control right now.  \n- Safety: (6,6) is empty, not occupied by either body, and gives 3 clean follow-ups (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) so we don\u2019t get boxed immediately.  \n- Avoid head-on: their likely targets (4,2),(6,2),(5,3) are far \u2013 no immediate collision risk this turn. Pushing down keeps options to cut them later while avoiding reckless head-to-head.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (6,6).

They're in the top-right corner. If I move UP toward the center, I can cut off their escape routes and force them into a corner.\n\n**OPTION A (UP to (4,3)):** Moves me toward the center and top of the board. From here I can control the top-left quadrant and potentially trap the opponent against the top edge. I can reach apples at (0,2), (1,2), (2,5), etc.\n\n**OPTION B (LEFT to (3,2)):** Moves me left toward the edge, but that might give the opponent more room to breathe in the center.\n\n**OPTION C (RIGHT to (5,2)):** Moves me back toward center, but I was just there.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nI need to **DOMINATE THE BOARD** and cut off the opponent's movement! Moving **UP** to (4,3) positions me perfectly to control the center and top-left. From there, I can sweep downward and box the opponent against the top-right corner.

More escape routes = less chance of being trapped while trying to pressure.  \n- Puts me in position to hit apples at (7,5)/(8,5) quickly to close the apple gap (we\u2019re down by 2). Growth = leverage to dominate lanes.  \n- Still moves us toward the opponent regionally (we can swing down-left after grabbing apples) without walking into a choke (LEFT is too tight).  \n- Opponent is low on vertical space near the bottom wall \u2014 getting length first then coaxing them into that corridor is our path to forcing mistakes.

Let's break it down.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (4, 4) - Center of the board, perfect control position!\n- Opponent head: (7, 5) - Top-right area, but their body is blocking their escape routes.\n- My body: [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)] - Tail is long but safe at bottom.\n- Opponent body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (3, 6)] - They're basically trapped in a box!\n\n**MOVE SAFETY CHECK FROM (4, 4):**\n1. **UP to (4, 5):** Row 5, col 4 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE! Moving up toward center-top.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3):** Row 3, col 4 = \".\" (empty) - BUT that's my own body! I'd hit myself! DEAD!\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4):** Row 4, col 3 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE! Moves left toward edge.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Row 4, col 5 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE! Moves right toward opponent's area.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:**\nOpponent at (7, 5) could move:\n- UP to (7, 6): Row 6, col 7 = \".\" (empty) - BUT that's their own body! They'd die!\n- DOWN to (7, 4): Row 4, col 7 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE\n- LEFT to (6, 5): Row 5, col 6 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE\n- RIGHT to (8, 5): Row 5, col 8 = \"A\" (apple!) - They'd eat and grow!\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 5) and they go DOWN to (7, 4), no collision.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 4) and they go RIGHT to (8, 5), no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 4) and they go LEFT to (6, 5), no collision.\nI'm safe from immediate head-on!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nChat, this is CRITICAL! From (4, 4), I have THREE safe moves but I need to THINK ahead. The opponent is TRAPPED in the top-right corner. If I move RIGHT to (5, 4), I get CLOSER to their territory and can cut off their escape routes. From (5, 4), I can reach apples at (8, 5), (7, 5) [dangerous!], (7, 3), (8, 2), etc. \n\nMoving RIGHT puts me on their doorstep and puts MORE pressure on them. They're already boxed in by their own body and walls - adding MY body nearby will FINISH them! Plus, (5, 4) is closer to the apple at (8, 5) which they might go for.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\n**RIGHT** to (5, 4) - Closer to opponent, better positioning to box them in, and still central enough to control the board! Let's tighten the noose!\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN is more aggressive toward center but slower to content \u2014 we want apples now.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT to eat (8,5) and tie the game (8\u20138).  \n- Next turn evaluate: likely go RIGHT to (9,5) or DOWN to (8,4) depending on enemy movement \u2014 keep escape lanes open, avoid head-on if scores are equal (don\u2019t gamble a mutual kill unless we have the apple lead).

Wait, hold up... \n\n**STRATEGIC CHECK:**\n- **My Apples:** 8\n- **Opponent Apples:** 8 (Wait, the scoreboard says Snake #0 apples: 8, but in the last rationale it said they were at 9. Looking at the board state, (8,5) now shows \"0\" which means they're occupying that cell, not an apple. So they're still at 8 apples, same as us! Perfect - we're still tied!)\n\n**CURRENT POSITION ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 4) - Right in the center-left, perfect position!\n- **My Body:** [(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)] - Long and stretched out, forming a barrier!\n- **Opponent Head:** (8, 4) - They're at (8,4) now? Let me check the board... Row 4 shows \"...T T 1 . 0 .\" So opponent head at (8,4), my head at (6,4). Wait, that's wrong - my head is at (6,4), but the board shows \"1\" at (6,4)? Let me re-read...\n\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 4: `. . . . T T 1 . 0 .`\nSo at y=4: x=6 is \"1\" (my head), x=8 is \"0\" (opponent head). So my head is at (6,4) \u2713\nOpponent head is at (8,4) \u2713\n\n**MOVE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6, 4):**\n1. **UP to (6, 5):** Row 5, col 6 = \"T\" - Wait, Row 5: `. A A . . . . T T .` So at (6,5) it's \".\" (empty). SAFE!\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3):** Row 3, col 6 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE!\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):** Row 4, col 5 = \"T\" (my own body!) - DEAD! Can't go back!\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Row 4, col 7 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE!\n\nSo SAFE moves are: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is death.\n\n**OPPONENT'S POSITION & THREAT:**\nOpponent at (8,4) - they're in the bottom-right corner area. From there, their safe moves are:\n- UP to (8,5): Row 5, col 8 = \"T\" (their own body!) - DEAD!\n- DOWN to (8,3): Row 3, col 8 = \"A\" (apple!) - SAFE!\n- LEFT to (7,4): Row 4, col 7 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE!\n- RIGHT to (9,4): Row 4, col 9 = \".\" (empty) - SAFE!\n\nSo opponent can safely go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They cannot go UP.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,4) and opponent goes LEFT to (7,4) \u2192 **BOTH DIE** (head-on collision)!\nIf I go UP to (6,5) and opponent goes DOWN to (8,3) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3) and opponent goes DOWN to (8,3) \u2192 no collision.\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:**\nLooking at the board for apples near me:\n- (7, 3): Two moves away (RIGHT then DOWN)\n- (8, 2): Two moves away (RIGHT then DOWN) - but (8,2) currently shows \"A\" on board!\n- (1, 2): Far away\n- (0, 7): Far away\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nWe need to catch up! Both snakes at 8 apples. The apple at (8,2) is juicy and reachable! From (6,4), if I go RIGHT to (7,4), then next turn I can go DOWN to (7,3) or RIGHT to (8,4) - but wait, (8,4) is occupied by opponent!\n\nActually, from (6,4):\n- RIGHT to (7,4) \u2192 then DOWN to (7,3) for the apple there!\n- Or RIGHT to (7,4) \u2192 then RIGHT to (8,4) but that's opponent territory!\n\nBetter plan: Go RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (8,2) and (7,3).\n\nBut wait - if opponent goes LEFT to (7,4) while I go RIGHT to (7,4) \u2192 **DOUBLE DEATH**. That's bad.\n\nWhat if opponent goes DOWN to (8,3) (there's an apple there!)? They'd eat and grow to 9. Then we're behind!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Opponent at (8,4) with apple at (8,3) below them and at (7,3) to the left-down-diagonal.\n- They're likely to go DOWN to eat the apple at (8,3) and get ahead!\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS:**\n1. **RIGHT to (7,4)** - Risky! Could collide if opponent goes LEFT. But gets me closer to apples.\n2. **UP to (6,5)** - Safe, moves toward center-top, no immediate apple but keeps options open.\n3. **DOWN to (6,3)** - Safe, moves toward (7,3) apple, also safer from collision.\n\n**REVELATION:** If opponent goes DOWN to (8,3) to eat the apple, and I go DOWN to (6,3), we both survive and I'm still chasing. If I go RIGHT and they go LEFT, we both die - that's a draw, not a win!\n\n**DECISION:** \nI need to play it safe! If I go RIGHT and opponent goes LEFT, we both die and it's a draw. If I go DOWN, I avoid that collision entirely and still position for the apple at (7,3) next turn.\n\nFrom (6,3) next turn, I can:\n- Go RIGHT to (7,3) for the apple\n- Or explore other areas\n\nAlso, my body is forming a barrier on the left. Moving DOWN keeps my options open and avoids the deadly head-on collision.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN to (6,3) - Safe, positions for apple at (7,3), avoids potential double-death collision.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the battlefield:\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (6, 3) \u2014 just moved DOWN last turn, good positioning!\n- My body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1)] \u2014 still a solid barrier!\n- Opponent head: (8, 3) \u2014 wait, they're at (8, 3) now? Looking at the board: row 3 shows \"... T . 1 A 0.\" So y=3: x=6 is \"1\" (me), x=8 is \"0\" (opponent). Yes, they moved DOWN to (8, 3) last turn and ate the apple! They're now at 9 apples\u2014LEADING! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**BOARD STATE KEY OBSERVATIONS:**\n- Apple at (7, 3) is STILL there! The opponent at (8, 3) is RIGHT NEXT TO IT! \n- Apple at (8, 2) is still there (row 2 shows \"A\" at col 8).\n- My body is blocking left side, opponent is on the right. The center is open.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- Opponent is at (8, 3) with apple at (7, 3) just one step LEFT. They WILL go LEFT to eat it and grow to 10 apples. That's a guaranteed move!\n- If I go RIGHT to (7, 3), that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION with the opponent if they go LEFT\u2014BOTH DIE! That's a draw, but we need a WIN!\n- If I go UP to (6, 4), I step onto my own body (tail is at (6, 1)? Wait, no: my body includes (6, 4) as the first segment after head! So going UP to (6, 4) would hit my own body\u2014DEAD! \u274c\n- If I go DOWN to (6, 2), that's safe and opens up options.\n- If I go LEFT to (5, 3), check: row 3, col 5 is \"T\" (part of my body!) \u2014 so LEFT is into my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES ONLY:**\n- UP: (6, 4) = my own body \u2192 DEAD\n- DOWN: (6, 2) = empty \u2192 SAFE\n- LEFT: (5, 3) = my own body \u2192 DEAD\n- RIGHT: (7, 3) = empty \u2192 SAFE BUT RISKY (collision if opponent goes LEFT)\n\n**STRATEGIC MIND GAMES:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3) and opponent goes LEFT to (7, 3), we BOTH DIE \u2192 DRAW. Not good enough! I need to OUTPLAY them, not draw!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I avoid collision entirely. Then what happens?\n- Opponent likely goes LEFT to (7, 3) to eat the apple (growing to 10).\n- I survive, but now I'm at (6, 2) with apple at (7, 3) still accessible next turn (just one RIGHT and UP).\n- More importantly, I stay alive and can continue to outmaneuver!\n\nBut wait\u2014CHANCE FOR GLORY! What if opponent does something unexpected? They might go DOWN to (8, 2) to eat that apple instead! If they go DOWN and I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I get the apple there and grow to 9! Then I'm back in the game!\n\n**RISK CALCULATION:**\n- Option A: Go DOWN (safe, no apple, but stays alive and plans)\n- Option B: Go RIGHT (risky, but if opponent goes DOWN, I get an apple and tie at 9-9!)\n\nI have 8 apples, opponent has 9. I need to CHASE! The apple at (7, 3) is RIGHT THERE. If I play safe, I let them grow to 10 and I fall behind. This is a RIVALRY\u2014I NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR CHAT:**\nTurn 26: If I survive (7, 3), I'll have 9 apples. Opponent might be at 10 or dead. From (7, 3), I can go DOWN to (7, 2) (apple at (8, 2) is close!), or UP to (7, 4) (safe). If opponent died, I WIN IMMEDIATELY. If they're alive, I need to keep pushing and boxing them in!\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nGO FOR THE APPLE! The risk is worth the reward. If opponent goes DOWN, I EAT and tie. If they go LEFT, we both die\u2014DRAW. But in a RIVALRY, we play to WIN or go down swinging!

THIS IS GAME TIME!\n\n**BOARD STATE (ROW 3):**\n(6,3) is my tail leaving? Let me check the body list...\nMy body: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)]\nActually wait - the head moved to (7,3), so the old head (6,3) becomes the new first body segment.\n\n**CRITICAL THREAT:**\nOpponent at (8, 2) is RIGHT BELOW me! If I go DOWN to (7, 2), that's adjacent but not immediate collision. If they go UP to (7, 2), we collide! But they might not.\n\n**SAFE MOVES FROM (7,3):**\n- UP to (7, 4): Check row 4... (7,4) is \"T\" (my body!) \u2192 DEAD \u274c\n- DOWN to (7, 2): Row 2 shows (7,2) is empty \u2192 SAFE \u2705\n- LEFT to (6, 3): That's my tail! Just left there - SAFE! (tail moves away) \u2705\n- RIGHT to (8, 3): Row 3, col 8 has opponent body! (8,3) is part of their body from (8,2)\u2192(8,3)\u2192(8,4) etc \u2192 DEAD \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC CALCULATION:**\nLeft move (6,3) is interesting - I retreat to where I came from. But wait... if I go LEFT to (6,3), I might collide with my own tail if it doesn't move? NO - tails move simultaneously. My tail at (6,1) will move, so (6,3) becomes available.\n\nDown move (7,2) is safer - keeps distance from opponent at (8,2). \n\n**LONG-TERM PLANNING:**\nOpponent is at (8,2). They have apple at (8,1)? No, (8,1) is empty. Apple at (7,1)? Empty. Apple at (6,1)? That's MY tail! \n\nI need to PROTECT my tail and set up a trap. Going DOWN to (7,2) gives me options next turn:\n- Can go LEFT to (6,2) \n- Can go DOWN to (7,1)\n- Can go RIGHT to (8,2) if opponent moves away\n\nBut going LEFT to (6,3) is RETREATING - I just came from there! That's boring.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nOpponent is at (8,2). If I go DOWN to (7,2), we're RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER! This sets up a potential head-on collision next turn if they go LEFT and I go RIGHT, or vice versa. \n\nWith equal scores (9-9), a head-on collision means DRAW. But if I can position to eat an apple AND force a collision where I survive? That's the WIN.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing DOWN to (7,2) keeps me alive and aggressive. It maintains pressure on the opponent and keeps my options open for both offense and defense.\n\nDOWN",

Scores are tied (9\u20139) \u2014 do NOT force a head-on. Too risky. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (9,2) = legal but hugs the wall, cuts my future options (no RIGHT after that). Passable but suboptimal. \u2705 (safe)  \n- DOWN -> (8,1) = legal, not occupied by any body, gives multiple follow-up options and avoids immediate head-on risk. \u2705 (best)\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Keeps distance from their head at (7,3) and avoids the (7,2) collision vector.  \n- Preserves lateral movement (I can pivot LEFT later to pressure or go back UP when safe) \u2014 better escape routes than going to x=9.  \n- We're tied on apples; we must avoid risky mutual kills. Play smart, box later when we have the lead.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (8,1) to stay safe and keep options open.  \n- Watch their intent: if they drift right or trap themselves toward y=0, pivot left/up to cut off escapes.  \n- If we can safely gain a single-apple lead without risking a head-on, do it; once ahead, force collisions where they must risk us.\n\nAlright fans \u2014 keep the energy, we press and then pounce.

Opponent is at (8,1) - they moved DOWN from (8,2) to (8,1). We're literally side by side!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (7,2)\n- My body: [(7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)] - my tail (5,1) will move, opening up space!\n- Opponent head: (8,1)\n- Opponent body: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- If opponent goes LEFT to (7,1) - that's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- If opponent goes UP to (8,2) - that's where I am NOW! Head-on collision = both dead!\n- If opponent goes RIGHT to (9,1) - valid move\n- If opponent goes DOWN - off board = dead!\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n- **LEFT to (6,2)**: Empty, but goes towards opponent's body at (6,6)... wait no, (6,2) is empty! Safe for now. But next turn I'd be near (5,1) tail?\n- **RIGHT to (8,2)**: OPPONENT'S BODY! That's their body segment - IMMEDIATE DEATH. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (7,1)**: There's an apple at (7,1)? No, apple at (8,0) but (7,1) is empty. BUT if opponent goes LEFT to (7,1), we both die! That's risky.\n- **UP to (7,3)**: That's MY BODY! Dead immediately. \u274c\n\n**WAIT...**\nLooking at the board display again:\nRow 2: A A . . T T . 1 T .\nSo (7,2) is my head, (7,3) above is \"T\" (my body), (8,2) is \"T\" (opponent body), (6,2) is empty!\n\n**CRITICAL DECISION:**\nFrom (7,2):\n- LEFT to (6,2): Safe! (6,2) is empty.\n- RIGHT to (8,2): DEAD - opponent body!\n- UP to (7,3): DEAD - my own body!\n- DOWN to (7,1): Empty, BUT sets up collision if opponent goes LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVE:**\nIf I go LEFT to (6,2), I'm safe. Opponent at (8,1) has apples at (8,0) and (7,1). They'll likely go for (8,0) DOWN or (7,1) LEFT.\n\nBut here's the FIRE play: If I go DOWN to (7,1), there's NO apple there actually... let me check apples again.\nApples: (2,1), (8,0), (4,0), (0,7), (1,2), (0,2), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (2,9), (1,9), (1,5), (1,8), (4,9)\n\nNo apple at (7,1) or (6,1) or (8,1)! Opponent at (8,1) has apple (8,0) directly below! They'll go DOWN to (8,0)!\n\n**PREDICTION:**\nOpponent will go DOWN to eat (8,0) apple! That's 100% likely.\n\nIf they go DOWN to (8,0), and I go DOWN to (7,1), we don't collide! I survive!\n\n**THE TRAP:**\nGo DOWN to (7,1). Next turn, opponent is at (8,0) with body stretching up. I can:\n- Go DOWN to (7,0) if safe\n- Go LEFT to (6,1) \n- Go RIGHT to (8,1) if opponent moves\n\nBut wait... (7,1) is adjacent to opponent's future position (8,0). That's setting up for potential head-on collision!\n\n**BETTER PLAY:**\nLEFT to (6,2) is safer. It gives me more space and keeps me away from opponent's likely path. Plus (6,2) is open and connects to empty areas.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nGoing LEFT is the smart play. It keeps me alive, gives me options, and lets opponent eat their apple while I reposition. We'll get another chance to close in!\n\nLEFT",

Grabs the apple to go up 10\u20139, gives us the scoring edge we want to start forcing collisions strategically. \u2705 (best)\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Take the apple now to grab the lead. Once we\u2019re up, start pressuring their escape routes and look to force a head-on where they must move into us.  \n- After eating at (8,0), pivot left/up to cut them off from the center while keeping an exit route \u2014 be the hunter, not the trapped snake. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFinal call \u2014 we grab the apple, get the lead, then clamp down.

We're BEHIND now! \ud83d\ude31 That last move we went LEFT to (6,2), but the opponent went DOWN to eat the (8,0) apple and is now at (8,0) with 11 apples! We're on a ticking clock here. We NEED to close this gap FAST. Look at that board\u2014I'm at (6,2), and right there at (6,1) is an apple just WAITING for me! If I eat it, I'm tied at 10-10 and we're back in this fight! Let's secure that W right now and keep the pressure on!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (6,2)\n- My body: [(7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)] - Tail (5,2) will open up space!\n- Opponent head: (8,0)\n- Opponent body: [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- Opponent at (8,0) is trapped at bottom-right. They can go UP to (8,1) (body), LEFT to (7,0) (empty?), or DOWN (off board, dead). They might try to loop around, but they're boxed in!\n- If I go DOWN to (6,1), there's an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- If opponent goes LEFT to (7,0), that's empty and safe for them. If they go UP to (8,1), that's their own body\u2014dead! So they likely go LEFT.\n\n**MY OPTIONS:**\n- **DOWN to (6,1)**: APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e I grow, score ties 10-10. Safe because (6,1) is empty and not into my body. Perfect aggressive move!\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: Safe? (5,2) is part of my body from last turn? Wait, my body includes (5,2) as the segment behind head? Actually, my tail is (5,2), so moving LEFT to (5,2) would hit my own tail as it moves\u2014DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: My body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **UP to (6,3)**: My body! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nDOWN to (6,1) is the ONLY safe move, AND it gives me an apple! Opponent is cornered at (8,0); they'll likely go LEFT to (7,0) to survive. No collision risk. This ties the score and sets me up to chase them down. Chat, we're turning this around!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (6,1), I'll be at (6,1) with 10 apples. Opponent at (7,0) or dead. Next turn, I can go DOWN to (6,0) if apple exists or LEFT to (5,1) to cut off their escape. Force them into a corner and win this game!\n\nDOWN",

Ready to clamp? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (7,0) this turn to stay central and keep escape lanes.  \n- Next turn push UP to (7,1) to threaten their approach and aim to cut off their route into the lower-right quadrant.  \n- If they try to escape left/up, close the corridor and either force a head-on (we\u2019re +1 apple) or trap them into our body.  \n- Avoid hugging the right wall (so skip RIGHT unless we have to).

Let\u2019s break it down fast and pick the W.\n\n---\n\n**BOARD STATE RECAP (Turn 29, Start of Turn):**\n- **My snake (ID 1):**  \n  - Head: (6, 1)  \n  - Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)]  \n  - Apples: 9  \n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):**  \n  - Head: (7, 0)  \n  - Body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]  \n  - Apples: 10 (ATE last turn, grew to 11? Wait, wait. The scoreboard says Snake #0 apples: 10, but the replay says they ate (8,0) and grew. In the scoreboard update after the last move, it shows they have 10, but the replay says they ate. Maybe they didn\u2019t eat? Let\u2019s check carefully.)\n\n  Actually, looking at the replay: \"Last move we went LEFT to (6,2), but the opponent went DOWN to eat the (8,0) apple and is now at (8,0) with 11 apples!\" But the scoreboard still shows Snake #0 apples: 10. Hmm, there\u2019s a discrepancy. Possibly the scoreboard is from before the last move, or the apple count is off. Given the board state, Snake #0 is at (7, 0) with body ending at (6, 7). The apple at (8, 0) is gone, but we don\u2019t see an apple listed there. However, the scoreboard says Snake #0 has 10 apples. Let\u2019s assume they ate and have 11, but the scoreboard might not have updated. For safety, assume they have 10+ apples and are dangerous.\n\n- **Apple drops:** (2,1), (4,0), (0,7), (1,2), (0,2), (0,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (2,9), (1,9), (1,5), (1,8), (4,9), (1,0). These are all on the board, not eaten yet.\n\n---\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS & OPPONENT MOVEMENT:**\n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Head at (7, 0). Options:\n  - **UP to (7, 1):** Currently empty. Safe. They\u2019d be moving up toward our territory.\n  - **LEFT to (6, 0):** Empty? Let's check the board: (6,0) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n  - **RIGHT to (8, 0):** That's where their body is! Their own body segment (8,0) is there? Wait, their body list starts with (8,0) as the first segment after head? Actually, the body list is given as [(8,0), (8,1), ...], meaning (8,0) is the first body segment after head. So if they move RIGHT to (8,0), they'd be moving into their own body. That would be death. So they can't go RIGHT.\n  - **DOWN:** Off board, death.\n  - So likely moves: UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0). They might try to loop around or chase an apple. (4,0) is an apple, which is left of them. So LEFT to (6,0) might be tempting to go for that apple.\n\n- **My snake:** Head at (6,1). My body occupies: (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). Also, note that the tail will move if I grow, but not this turn.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS (from (6,1)):**\n1. **UP to (6,2):** That's my own body (first segment). Moving into my body = death. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6,0):** Empty? (6,0) is '.' on the board. But is it safe from opponent? If opponent goes LEFT to (6,0) at the same time, both heads collide -> both die. That's a head-on collision! If we both die, opponent has more apples (10 vs 9), they win. So if there's any chance they go LEFT, this is risky.\n3. **LEFT to (5,1):** Empty? (5,1) is '.' on the board. Safe from my body. But is it safe from opponent? If opponent goes UP to (7,1), no collision. If they go LEFT to (6,0), no collision. So seems safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,1):** Empty? (7,1) is '.' on the board. But is it safe from opponent? If opponent goes UP to (7,1), then both heads collide -> both die. Risk of head-on collision. Also, my body: (7,2) is part of my body, but (7,1) is not my body. So safe from self. But risky from opponent.\n\n**EVALUATE RISK:**\n- **DOWN to (6,0):** Possible head-on collision if opponent goes LEFT. If they do, we both die, opponent wins (10 vs 9). Bad.\n- **LEFT to (5,1):** Safe from collision? Opponent is at (7,0). Even if they go LEFT to (6,0), no collision. If they go UP to (7,1), no collision. So safest.\n- **RIGHT to (7,1):** Possible head-on collision if opponent goes UP. If they do, both die, opponent wins. Risky.\n- **UP to (6,2):** Death immediately.\n\nSo safest move is LEFT to (5,1). But we also need to think about apples and long-term. There's an apple at (1,0) and (4,0). (4,0) is within reach if we go LEFT now. Actually, (5,1) is not directly closer to any apple? (1,0) is far, (4,0) is closer if we go LEFT. (5,1) to (4,0) is DOWN-LEFT next turn.\n\n**APPLES IN PLAY:**\n- (4,0) is right below (4,1)? Actually (4,0) is an apple at bottom row. From (5,1), we can go DOWN to (5,0) or LEFT to (4,1) then DOWN to (4,0). (1,0) is another apple at far left.\n- (2,1) is an apple near us? (2,1) is east of (1,1), but from (5,1) it's far.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So our primary goal is to contain the enemy and force a collision where we win. Right now, enemy is at (7,0), cornered at bottom-right. We want to close in on them, not chase apples blindly.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe need to trap the enemy. They are at (7,0). If we go LEFT to (5,1), we move left, possibly cutting off their path to the left side. If they go LEFT to (6,0) or UP to (7,1), we can chase. We have higher score? Wait, we have 9, they have 10. Actually, they have more apples, so if we force a head-on collision, they win. We need to grow first to match or exceed their score. That means we should eat apples when safe, but prioritize trapping them.\n\nBut in this turn, from (6,1), there's no apple directly reachable without risk. (6,1) itself has no apple listed (the apple at (6,1) was eaten last turn? In the last rationale, they mentioned (6,1) had an apple, but after moving DOWN, head is at (6,1) now? Wait, the last move was DOWN to (6,1)? Actually, the last move was DOWN, so head moved from (6,2) to (6,1). But the board state shows head at (6,1). So (6,1) is occupied by head, no apple there now. The apples listed are all other cells.\n\nSo no immediate apple to eat this turn. So we just move to position ourselves.\n\n**POTENTIAL PLANS:**\n- Go LEFT to (5,1): This moves us west, possibly to intercept enemy if they try to go to (6,0) or (5,0). Also, (5,1) is adjacent to (4,1) and (5,0), which could lead to apples later. It also opens up the space for our tail to move, giving us more room.\n- Go DOWN to (6,0): Risky due to possible head-on collision. If enemy goes LEFT, we collide and lose. If enemy goes UP, we are safe but at (6,0). From (6,0), we can go LEFT to (5,0) or RIGHT to (7,0) (but (7,0) is enemy head? Actually enemy is at (7,0), so if we go RIGHT to (7,0), that's enemy head \u2013 collision if they stay, but they move. So if we move to (6,0) and they move UP to (7,1), no collision. But (6,0) is risky.\n- Go RIGHT to (7,1): Risky due to possible head-on collision if enemy goes UP. Also, (7,1) is closer to enemy but might lead to being surrounded by their body.\n\nGiven the instruction to be aggressive but also survive, and considering the head-on collision risk, I think the safest aggressive move is LEFT to (5,1). It avoids immediate collision risk and positions us to close in on enemy from the left side, potentially boxing them in against the wall.\n\n**SITUATION UPDATE:**\n- My score: 9\n- Enemy score: 10 (assumed)\n- We are behind, so we need to grow soon, but not at the cost of death. Left move keeps us alive and gives us options.\n\n**FINAL MOVE SELECTION:**\nAfter eliminating death moves (UP, and considering the risky RIGHT and DOWN), LEFT seems the best balance of safety and positioning.\n\n---\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,1), next turn I plan to assess enemy movement. If they go LEFT to (6,0), I might go DOWN to (5,0) to cut off their escape to the bottom-left apple (4,0). If they go UP to (7,1), I can go LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) to approach (4,0) apple. Goal is to grow by eating (4,0) or (1,0) soon, while keeping enemy trapped near bottom-right. Force them into a corner where I have higher score by turn 35.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Quick, loud scan and call:\n\nImmediate safety check (from our head at 7,0):\n- RIGHT -> (8,0) is our neck (backwards) \u2014 illegal. \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (7,-1) off-board \u2014 instant death. \u274c  \n- LEFT -> (6,0) is legal and aggressive \u2014 moves toward enemy and can FORCE a head\u2011on if they go DOWN. \u26a0\ufe0f risky but has payoff.  \n- UP -> (7,1) is legal, keeps more escape lanes and still threatens a head\u2011on if they try to go RIGHT into us. \u2705 my pick.\n\nEnemy read: opponent head at (6,1). Their neck is (6,2) so they cannot move UP. Their legal moves are DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1), or RIGHT (7,1). We\u2019re +1 apple (10 vs 9) \u2014 that means if we can engineer a simultaneous head collision on our terms, we win the round. Do we bait it? Hell yes, but don\u2019t throw.\n\nWhy UP is the correct move this turn:\n- Safety: UP keeps more future options (we avoid getting pinned against the bottom wall and away from our neck).  \n- Pressure: Occupying (7,1) threatens the RIGHT move of the opponent \u2014 if they try to escape RIGHT into (7,1) at the same time, it\u2019s a head-on double KO and we win (10 > 9).  \n- Flexibility: From (7,1) we can pivot to cut their exits (aim to move LEFT next turn to pressure from above, or swing back to the right if their body shifts).  \n- Avoid unnecessary suicide: Moving LEFT into (6,0) invites an immediate duel where they could simply sidestep LEFT or RIGHT to avoid collision; UP forces them to make a more painful choice while keeping our escape routes open.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn now: UP to (7,1) \u2014 threaten the RIGHT escape and keep mobility.  \n- If opponent goes RIGHT into us => mutual death -> we win by apple lead. If opponent goes DOWN (to 6,0) or LEFT (to 5,1), we follow the pressure: close corridor, cut exits, and force them into tighter space near their existing body segments at (7,2)/(6,2)/(6,3).  \n- Avoid hugging the right wall and don\u2019t chase apples blindly \u2014 grow only when it helps trap them. Keep two-move escape routes when possible.\n\nWe play to win, not to feed. Let\u2019s bait the mistake and capitalize.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's break down this critical turn 30. The enemy is at (7, 0) and we're at (5, 1). We gotta play this smart to box them in!\n\n**ANALYSIS & MOVE DECISION:**\n\nFirst, check our immediate survival from (5, 1):\n- **UP to (5, 2):** That's part of our body (we have (5, 4) and others, but specifically (5, 2) is NOT in our body list. Wait, our body is: [(6,1), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)]. (5,2) is empty! Actually, no - look carefully: (5,2) is not listed. So UP is safe from self. But is it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (7,0), far right. UP to (5,2) seems safe.\n- **DOWN to (5, 0):** Empty? (5,0) is '.' on board. Safe from self. But is it safe from enemy? If enemy moves LEFT to (6,0), no collision. If enemy moves UP to (7,1), no collision. So DOWN might be safe.\n- **LEFT to (4, 1):** Empty? (4,1) is '.' on board. Safe from self. Safe from enemy? Enemy at (7,0) can't reach (4,1) in one move. So LEFT is safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 1):** That's our HEAD! Wait, we're at (5,1), moving RIGHT to (6,1). But (6,1) is where we just came from! Actually, our previous head was at (6,1) before last move. Now our head is at (5,1). (6,1) is the first body segment! So moving RIGHT into (6,1) would be moving into our own body. That's instant death. \u274c\n\nSo RIGHT is dead. UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe from immediate self-collision.\n\nNow, consider enemy moves:\nEnemy at (7,0) can:\n- UP to (7,1): Empty on board.\n- LEFT to (6,0): Empty on board.\n- RIGHT to (8,0): That's their own body (first segment is (8,0)). So they die if they go RIGHT.\n- DOWN: Off board, death.\n\nSo enemy will likely go UP or LEFT. If they go LEFT to (6,0) and we go DOWN to (5,0), we might be close but no head-on collision. If we go LEFT to (4,1) and they go UP to (7,1), no collision. If we go UP to (5,2) and they go LEFT to (6,0), no collision.\n\nBut here's the key: We need to TRAP them. They're in the bottom-right corner. If we go DOWN to (5,0), we cut off their path to the bottom-left apples and approach (4,0) apple. If we go LEFT to (4,1), we move away from them but get closer to the apple cluster at (4,0) and (1,0). If we go UP to (5,2), we move into the center but away from the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:** We're behind 9-10. We need to grow to match or exceed their score before forcing a collision. But we also need to box them in. The apple at (4,0) is within reach if we go DOWN now. From (5,0), we can go LEFT to (4,0) next turn and eat it, tying the score at 10-10 (assuming they don't eat). But we must be careful: if we go DOWN to (5,0) and enemy goes LEFT to (6,0), we're adjacent. Then next turn we could go RIGHT to (6,0) if they move, but they might move UP.\n\nActually, going DOWN to (5,0) seems the most aggressive. It positions us to eat (4,0) next turn while also cutting off their escape left. If they go LEFT to (6,0), we're at (5,0) - one step away. If they go UP to (7,1), we're still in a good position to chase.\n\nUP to (5,2) moves us away from the action and might let them escape left. LEFT to (4,1) is safe but we miss the chance to cut them off at the bottom.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- DOWN: Risk of head-on collision? If enemy goes LEFT to (6,0) and we go DOWN to (5,0), no collision (different cells). If enemy goes UP to (7,1), no collision. So DOWN is safe from immediate death.\n- UP: Safe but less aggressive.\n- LEFT: Safe but less aggressive.\n\nGiven we need to be aggressive and box them in, DOWN to (5,0) is the best move. It sets up eating (4,0) next turn and maintains pressure on their corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (5,0) now. If enemy moves LEFT to (6,0), next turn go RIGHT to (6,0) to cut them off (but wait, they might move UP). Actually, if they go LEFT to (6,0), we can go RIGHT to (6,0) and that's a head-on collision if they stay at (6,0) next turn. But they'll move. Better: from (5,0), if they're at (6,0), we can go LEFT to (4,0) to eat the apple, then chase. If they go UP to (7,1), we go LEFT to (4,0) anyway to grow. Goal: Eat (4,0) next turn to tie score, then trap them against the right wall.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
