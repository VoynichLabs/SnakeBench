However, I don't want to risk running into the wall or another snake, so I'll try to find a safer route.\n\nI notice that I can move up to position (2, 8) and then move left to position (1, 8), which would put me in a good position to grab the apple at (1, 9). This route also avoids the wall and other snakes.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move up to position (2, 8) and then reassess the situation.\n\nNext move: UP"
