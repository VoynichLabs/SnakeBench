However, I need to be careful about the enemy snake at (6, 8).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 7), I'll be directly below the enemy snake's head. This is dangerous because:\n1.

It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n2. It positions me to potentially go after either the apple at (7, 9) by going UP later\n3. I could also go for the apple at (7, 0) by going DOWN\n4. It gives me more open space and flexibility\n\nThe RIGHT move seems safer and more strategic, allowing me to maintain distance from the enemy while positioning myself to access two different apples.\n\nFor my next turn, I should evaluate whether to go UP toward (7, 9) or DOWN toward (7, 0) based on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nRIGHT"

It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n2. It positions me to potentially go after either the apple at (7, 9) by going UP later\n3. I could also go for the apple at (7, 0) by going DOWN\n4.
