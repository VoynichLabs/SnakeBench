There is an apple at (8,2) which is to your right and same row? Actually (8,2) is 3 steps right (x+3) and same y.\n- Another apple at (7,0) is down and right? (x+2, y-2) from you.\n- (7,4) is up and right (x+2, y+2).\n- (3,7) is far left and up (x-2, y+5).\n- (8,3) is right and up (x+3, y+1).\n\n**Possible moves from (5,2):**\n- UP: (5,3)\n- DOWN: (5,1)\n- LEFT: (4,2)\n- RIGHT: (6,2)\n\n**Check for immediate deaths:**\n- None of these moves go off the board (all within 0-9).\n- Since you have no body, you cannot hit yourself (even backwards is safe for now).\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (1,6) which is far away (distance 5 in x and 4 in y). So no immediate collision risk with enemy body (it has no body) or head (too far).\n\nSo all four moves are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe want to move towards apples and keep future options open.\n\nClosest apples:\n- (8,2) is at same y=2, so right (x+3) is direct path.\n- (8,3) is at (x+3, y+1) so right and up.\n- (7,0) is (x+2, y-2) so right and down.\n- (7,4) is (x+2, y+2) so right and up.\n- (3,7) is left and up, but far.\n\nSo most apples are to the right. Therefore, RIGHT seems good to get closer to multiple apples.\n\nAlso, RIGHT moves to (6,2). From there, we can go UP to (6,3) or DOWN to (6,1) or further RIGHT to (7,2). So it keeps options open.\n\nLEFT moves to (4,2) which is away from most apples and might lead to fewer options later? But not bad.\n\nUP to (5,3) or DOWN to (5,1) are also safe, but not directly towards the cluster of apples.\n\nSo RIGHT is preferred.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead towards the right side where multiple apples are located (around x=7-8, y=0-4). Avoid moving too far up where the enemy is (at y=6) for now, but it's far. Collect apples to grow and then be cautious of collisions.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT",

UP gets me aligned horizontally with apple, which might be slightly better for cutting off enemy path? Enemy is at (5, 2), far from (3, 7) for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nWe have no body, so we can move freely. Prioritize collecting nearest apple while staying central enough to avoid being trapped later. After eating first apple, we\u2019ll have a body segment, so need to avoid moving backwards into it next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP moves me toward closest apple and keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 7), apple at (3, 7) is 2 steps right. Consider moving RIGHT next turn unless enemy blocks. Keep an eye on Snake #1\u2019s position to avoid head-on collisions in future.  \n\nUP",

But given enemy\u2019s long body, maybe it will go for nearest apple (2, 5) via LEFT (5, 4) or DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5, 4), I must avoid DOWN to (5, 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 My safe moves considering possible enemy moves:**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (5, 4)** \u2013 risky if enemy goes LEFT to (5, 4).  \n2. **LEFT to (4, 5)** \u2013 safe from enemy\u2019s possible moves: enemy can\u2019t reach (4, 5) in one move from (6, 4).  \n3. **RIGHT to (6, 5)** \u2013 risky if enemy goes UP to (6, 5).  \n\nSo LEFT is the only move guaranteed safe regardless of enemy\u2019s choice.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \nFrom (4, 5):  \n- Closest apple: (2, 5) distance 2 left.  \n- Next turn, body will be: head (4, 5), tail (5, 5), old tail (5, 6) disappears (since I didn\u2019t eat apple).  \n- From (4, 5), possible moves next turn: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5) is body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nLEFT now keeps me safe and moves toward apple (2, 5) while avoiding enemy\u2019s possible path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (4, 5), enemy will likely be at (5, 4) if it went for (2, 5), or at (6, 3) if it went toward (7, 0). Either way, I\u2019ll be close to (2, 5) and can try to get it next turn if enemy isn\u2019t blocking.

No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nAll three moves are safe and don't lead directly to an apple. However, consider the board:\n- UP (6,5): leads to an empty area. From there, you can go UP to (6,6), LEFT to (5,5) (enemy head, risky), or RIGHT to (7,5) (empty).\n- DOWN (6,3): leads to empty area. From there, you can go DOWN to (6,2) (empty), LEFT to (5,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (7,3) (empty).\n- LEFT (5,4): leads to empty area. From there, you can go UP to (5,5) (enemy head, risky), DOWN to (5,3) (empty), or LEFT to (4,4) (empty).\n\nNote: The enemy head is at (5,5). Moving LEFT to (5,4) puts you adjacent to the enemy head. This is risky because if the enemy moves DOWN to (5,4) next turn, you could collide. Similarly, moving UP to (6,5) is adjacent diagonally, but not directly sharing a cell.\n\nTo avoid potential head-on collisions, it's better to avoid moving too close to the enemy head. Therefore, DOWN (6,3) seems safest because it moves away from the enemy (at (5,5)).\n\nAlso, consider apples: the closest apples are (7,0) and (1,1)/(1,2). Moving DOWN (6,3) gets you closer to (7,0) (which is at y=0). From (6,3), you can go DOWN to (6,2), then (6,1), (6,0), then LEFT to (7,0) to eat it. This is a good path.\n\nMoving LEFT (5,4) is closer to the apples at (1,1) and (1,2), but also closer to the enemy. Moving UP (6,5) takes you away from most apples.\n\nSo DOWN is preferred to start heading towards (7,0) while avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,3), next turn consider continuing DOWN to (6,2) to approach (7,0). Also, watch the enemy at (5,5): it might move towards you or towards other apples. Avoid direct confrontation since you are larger (6 segments vs 2) but head-on collision would kill both. Prefer to collect apples safely and let the enemy possibly die on its own.\n\nDOWN",

Check enemy\u2019s new head position. Likely move UP/DOWN/LEFT to stay safe and target (1,2) or (1,1) next.  \n\nLEFT",

No immediate collision risk.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- DOWN (6,1): Moves directly towards the apple at (7,0). From (6,1), you can go DOWN to (6,0) and then RIGHT to (7,0) to eat it. This is the shortest path to an apple.\n- LEFT (5,2): Moves towards the center. There are apples at (1,1) and (1,2), but this path is longer and might bring you closer to the enemy at (3,5). However, the enemy is small and might avoid conflict.\n- RIGHT (7,2): Moves towards the right side. From (7,2), you can go DOWN to (7,1) and then DOWN to (7,0) to eat the apple. This is also a good path to (7,0), but it requires an extra move compared to going DOWN directly.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (3,5) with only 2 segments. It might be heading towards the apples at (1,1), (1,2), or (2,5). Moving DOWN avoids the enemy and targets (7,0), which is uncontested.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: After moving DOWN to (6,1), you have multiple options (DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), RIGHT to (7,1)) all safe. This keeps flexibility.\n\nMoving LEFT (5,2) might lead to a potential conflict with the enemy if it moves down. Similarly, RIGHT (7,2) is safe but doesn't progress as directly towards (7,0) as DOWN does.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best choice to safely collect (7,0) in the fewest moves.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (7,0), consider moving towards (0,9) via the top-left. However, watch for enemy movements. Snake #0 is small and may die easily. Avoid head-on collisions; let it risk itself. Prioritize collecting apples safely. After (7,0), the next closest apple is (2,5) or (1,1)/(1,2), but be cautious of the enemy near (3,5). Alternatively, if the enemy moves away, you can target (2,5). Otherwise, head towards (0,9) which is far and safe.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- DOWN (6,0): Moves directly towards the apple at (7,0). From (6,0), you can go RIGHT to (7,0) to eat it next turn. This is the shortest path to an apple.\n- LEFT (5,1): Moves away from the apple at (7,0) and towards the center. There are apples at (1,1) and (1,2), but this path is longer and might bring you closer to the enemy at (2,5). However, the enemy is small and might avoid conflict.\n- RIGHT (7,1): Moves towards the apple at (7,0). From (7,1), you can go DOWN to (7,0) to eat it next turn. This is equally efficient as DOWN, but RIGHT might be slightly riskier if the enemy moves unpredictably? Actually, both DOWN and RIGHT lead to the apple in the same number of moves.\n\nHowever, consider the board: moving DOWN to (6,0) is safe and directly adjacent to the apple. Moving RIGHT to (7,1) is also safe and adjacent to the apple. But note: if you move RIGHT to (7,1), you are closer to the right edge (x=7) but still safe. Both moves are good.\n\nBut also consider future moves after eating the apple: after eating (7,0), you will grow and your tail will extend. Currently, your tail is at (8,4). After moving to (7,0) and eating, your body will become longer: head at (7,0), then (6,0) [if you moved DOWN first] or (7,1) [if you moved RIGHT first], and then the rest. Actually, it doesn't matter much.\n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (6,0) might be slightly better because it leaves you with more options after eating the apple: from (7,0) after eating, you can go UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) (but that would be into your own body? Wait, after moving to (6,0) this turn, next turn you go RIGHT to (7,0) to eat. Then your head is at (7,0), and your body will be [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), ...]. So from (7,0), you can go UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) (but that is your body) or RIGHT to (8,0) or DOWN? DOWN is (7,-1) which is invalid. So only UP and RIGHT are safe. Similarly, if you go RIGHT to (7,1) this turn, then next turn DOWN to (7,0) to eat. Then head at (7,0), body: [(7,1), (6,1), ...]. Then from (7,0), safe moves: UP to (7,1) (body), LEFT to (6,0) (empty), RIGHT to (8,0) (empty). So LEFT and RIGHT are safe. So both paths give two safe moves after eating.\n\nTherefore, both DOWN and RIGHT are equally good for reaching (7,0). But consider the enemy: snake #0 is at (2,5) and is unlikely to interfere with (7,0). So both are safe.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (3,9) and (0,9) in the top. After eating (7,0), you might want to head towards those. From (7,0), moving LEFT (to (6,0)) is not safe because it's your body, but if you went DOWN path, your body blocks LEFT. If you went RIGHT path, your body blocks UP. So both are symmetric.\n\nBut note: moving DOWN to (6,0) is closer to the left side, which might be better for eventually reaching (0,9) and (3,9)? Actually, (6,0) is at the bottom left, and (7,0) is bottom right. After eating, you'll need to go upwards.\n\nTo avoid overcomplicating, both moves are good. But since DOWN is safe and directly towards the apple, and it was my previous plan, I'll stick with DOWN.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT (5,1) is safe but moves away from the immediate apple. So it's less efficient.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best choice to collect (7,0) next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (7,0), you'll have 6 apples. Then consider moving upwards towards (3,9) and (0,9). The enemy snake #0 is at (2,5) and might also target (1,1) and (1,2). Avoid head-on collisions; if the enemy moves towards you, you can use your size advantage (you are longer) to force it to avoid you. But prioritize safety. After (7,0), move to (6,0) is not possible (body), so from (7,0) go RIGHT to (8,0) or UP to (7,1). Then continue upwards. Alternatively, if the enemy is not threatening, you can go leftwards to collect (1,1) and (1,2). But watch for enemy movements.\n\nDOWN",

Eating an apple is safe (you grow and the apple is removed).\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- RIGHT (7,0): Moves directly onto the apple. You will eat it and grow to length 7. This is the immediate goal.\n- LEFT (5,0): Moves away from the apple and towards the left edge. There are apples at (1,1) and (1,2), but this is a longer path. Also, moving LEFT might limit future options as you are near the edge.\n\nRIGHT is clearly the best choice to collect the apple immediately.\n\n**After eating the apple:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,0), you eat the apple. Your new head will be at (7,0), and your body becomes: [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4)].\nFrom (7,0), next turn you can consider moving UP to (7,1) or RIGHT to (8,0) (both should be safe). Avoid moving LEFT to (6,0) as it is your body.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (7,0), you have 6 apples. Next, target the apples at (1,1) and (1,2) or the ones at (0,9) and (3,9). The enemy snake #0 is at (1,5) and might be heading towards (1,1) and (1,2). Since you are longer (length 7 vs enemy length 3), you can potentially force the enemy to avoid you. However, prioritize safety. From (7,0), move upwards (e.g., to (7,1)) and then leftwards through the bottom rows (y=0,1,2) to collect (1,1) and (1,2). Alternatively, you can go upwards to the top for (0,9) and (3,9), but that is farther. Watch the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually, it would be empty next turn since you moved. But careful: after moving to (7,2), your body will be [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]? Actually, the tail moves forward so (6,4) is dropped? Wait, you haven't eaten an apple so length remains same. So after moving to (7,2), your body becomes: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]? But (6,3) is still there.

So no immediate threat.\n\nRIGHT seems better because it gives more options next turn. UP leads to a position with only two safe moves next turn (UP and RIGHT), while RIGHT gives three (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Also, moving RIGHT avoids getting trapped along the left edge where your body is.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,1), you can consider going UP to (8,2) or RIGHT to (9,1) or even DOWN to (8,0) to explore the bottom right. The apples at (0,9), (3,9), (5,9) are far, but you can gradually work your way up the right side. Alternatively, you can later turn left towards the center. Avoid getting too close to your own body.

From (8,2), next moves:\n  - UP: (8,3) - empty\n  - DOWN: (8,1) - will be empty next turn (since you moved, your body shifts)\n  - LEFT: (7,2) - empty\n  - RIGHT: (9,2) - empty\n  So all four directions might be safe next turn? Actually, after moving to (8,2), your body becomes: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. So (8,1) is free, (7,2) is free, (9,2) free, (8,3) free. So UP gives good flexibility.\n\n- DOWN (8,0): Moves downward. From (8,0), next moves:\n  - UP: (8,1) - free (since you moved away)\n  - DOWN: (8,-1) - off board (would die)\n  - LEFT: (7,0) - your body (would die)\n  - RIGHT: (9,0) - empty\n  So only UP and RIGHT would be safe next turn. This is limiting.\n\n- RIGHT (9,1): Moves right. From (9,1), next moves:\n  - UP: (9,2) - empty\n  - DOWN: (9,0) - empty\n  - LEFT: (8,1) - free (since you moved)\n  - RIGHT: (10,1) - off board (would die)\n  So only UP, DOWN, LEFT safe next turn. Still three options.\n\nSo UP gives the most flexibility (4 options next turn), while DOWN and RIGHT give fewer.\n\n**Apples:**\n- The closest apple is (1,1) but it's far and enemy snake #0 is near it (head at (1,2)). It might go for (1,1) or (2,4). So avoid that area for now.\n- Other apples are at (0,9), (3,9), (5,9) (top row) and (2,4) (center). Moving UP helps get closer to the top row apples in the long term.\n\n**Enemy:**\nSnake #0 is at (1,2). It might move to (1,1) to eat the apple, or (1,3) (but its body is there), or (0,2) or (2,2). It is not a direct threat to you.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove towards the top row apples (0,9), (3,9), (5,9) gradually. Avoid getting trapped in the bottom left where your body is. UP is a good step towards that. Also, UP gives the most options for future moves.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\nFrom (8,2), you can go UP to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,2) to start heading west towards the center. Avoid going DOWN to avoid limiting options. The enemy is small and in the top left, so focus on collecting apples on the top and right.\n\nUP",

From (8,4), next moves:\n  - UP: (8,5) - empty\n  - DOWN: (8,3) - will be free (since you moved, your body shifts)\n  - LEFT: (7,4) - empty\n  - RIGHT: (9,4) - empty\n  So all four directions safe next turn? Actually, after moving to (8,4), your body becomes: [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)]. So (8,3) is free, (7,4) free, (9,4) free, (8,5) free. UP gives excellent flexibility and moves toward top apples.\n\n- LEFT (7,3): Moves left. From (7,3), next moves:\n  - UP: (7,4) - empty\n  - DOWN: (7,2) - empty? Currently (7,2) is free. But your body has (7,1) and (7,0). So DOWN is safe.\n  - LEFT: (6,3) - empty\n  - RIGHT: (8,3) - free (since you moved)\n  So all four directions safe? Actually, check: (7,2) is empty now. So LEFT gives good flexibility too.\n\n- RIGHT (9,3): Moves right.

Three options.\n\nSo UP and LEFT both give 4 safe options next turn, while RIGHT gives only 3.\n\n**Apples:**\n- The top row has apples at (0,9), (3,9), (5,9). Moving UP gets you closer to these.\n- There are apples at (2,4) and (0,4) near the enemy snake (head at (2,1)). Avoid that area for now.\n- UP is a good step towards the top row apples.\n\n**Enemy:**\nSnake #0 is at (2,1). It might move to (1,1) (its body), (2,0), (3,1), or (2,2). It is not a direct threat to you at (8,3). Moving UP or LEFT keeps you away.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving towards the top row apples. From (8,4), you can go UP to (8,5) and then left towards (0,9) or (3,9). Alternatively, LEFT (7,3) is also safe and allows moving north-west. But UP is more direct for the apples.\n\nUP is better for apple collection, while LEFT is also safe but slightly slower for reaching top apples.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\nFrom (8,4), consider going UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,4) to start heading west.

Your body has (7,1) and (7,0), so DOWN is safe.\n  - LEFT: (6,5) - empty\n  - RIGHT: (8,5) - free (since you moved)\n  So all four directions safe. LEFT moves you west, which is toward the left-side apples (0,9) and (0,4), but (0,4) is near the enemy.\n\n- RIGHT (9,5): Moves right.

UP is direct progress toward these.\n- The apple at (2,4) is near the enemy (head at (2,3)), so avoid that area. (0,4) is also near enemy territory.\n- UP is better for reaching the top apples quickly.\n\n**Enemy:**\nSnake #0 is at (2,3). It might move to (2,2) (its body), (2,4), (1,3), or (3,3). It is far from you and not a direct threat. Moving UP keeps you away.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving toward the top row apples. From (8,6), you can go UP to (8,7) and then left toward (0,9) or (3,9). Alternatively, LEFT (7,5) is safe but slightly slower for reaching top apples. UP is more direct.\n\nUP is the best choice for apple collection and maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\nFrom (8,6), consider going UP to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,6) to start heading west.

Alternatively, you can later turn north to (7,8) and then west. Avoid moving right to prevent dead-ends.

No immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple to me: (0,9) is 2 steps up.  \nIf I go UP now to (0,8), I\u2019m 1 step from (0,9) next turn.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1,7), I\u2019m farther from (0,9) but closer to (3,9) and (5,9) via top row later.  \n\nEnemy at (5,8) can eat (5,9) this turn if it goes UP. If it does, it will grow to length 9, and its tail will move forward (currently tail at (8,4) \u2192 next turn tail at (8,5) if it moves UP).  \n\nIf enemy eats (5,9), it will be longer than me by 2 segments. I need apples quickly to keep up.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\n**UP to (0,8):**  \nFrom (0,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0,9) \u2013 apple  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7) \u2013 my body \u2192 no  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) \u2013 empty  \nSafe: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n**RIGHT to (1,7):**  \nFrom (1,7) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (1,8) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) \u2013 my body \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) \u2013 empty  \nSafe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nRIGHT gives more safe moves next turn, but UP gets me to (0,9) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of enemy intercepting (0,9)**  \nEnemy at (5,8) cannot reach (0,9) in 1 move. It would take at least 5 moves for enemy to get to (0,9) from (5,8). So (0,9) is safe for me to claim in 2 moves if I go UP now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nIf I go UP now, I eat (0,9) next turn, grow to length 8 (tie enemy if enemy doesn\u2019t eat an apple this turn).  \nIf enemy eats (5,9) this turn, it will be length 9, I\u2019ll be length 8 after next turn.  \n\nBut there are other apples at (3,9) and (4,5) and (3,2). After eating (0,9), I can go right along top row toward (3,9) while enemy may go for (4,5) or (3,2).  \n\nGiven the apple race, securing (0,9) is crucial. RIGHT delays that and might let enemy get (3,9) before me if it moves left after (5,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is slightly riskier next turn (only 2 safe moves) but secures the apple path and ties or nearly ties length with enemy.  \nRIGHT gives more options but loses the quick apple.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to (0,8) to claim (0,9) next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,8), go UP to (0,9) to eat apple, then likely RIGHT to (1,9) unless enemy threatens.  \n\nUP",

This is safe (not off board, not a body segment).\n- DOWN: (5,7) - your own body (the segment directly behind head) - would die.\n- LEFT: (4,8) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (6,8) - empty (safe)\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n- UP (5,9): This moves you onto the apple at (5,9). You will grow by 1 segment (new tail added). This increases your apple count to 8. After eating, your body will be: head at (5,9), then (5,8), (5,7), ... etc. This is highly beneficial as it gets you closer to 30 and extends your lead over snake #0 (which has 6). Also, from (5,9), you can next move to (4,9) or (6,9) or (5,8) (which is free since body shifts). So good options.\n\n- LEFT (4,8): Moves west. This is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately. From (4,8), you can go UP to (4,9) (empty), DOWN to (4,7) (empty), LEFT to (3,8) (empty), or RIGHT to (5,8) (free). So all directions safe. This moves you toward the apple at (3,9) and (0,9).\n\n- RIGHT (6,8): Moves east. Safe but no apple. From (6,8), you can go UP to (6,9) (empty), DOWN to (6,7) (your body? Wait: (6,7) is your body segment. But next turn, when you move, your body shifts. So (6,7) will be free? Actually, after moving to (6,8), your body becomes: head (6,8), then (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), ... So (6,7) is still occupied by your body? Let's check: the body segments are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), ... So (6,7) is the second segment. After moving to (6,8), the new body is: head (6,8), then (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), ... So (6,7) is still occupied. Therefore, from (6,8), DOWN to (6,7) would be into your own body (would die). So only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from (6,8). So RIGHT gives fewer options next turn.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:**\nIt is at (0,7). It might move to (0,8), (0,6) (its body), (1,7), or (-1,7) (off board). So it has limited safe moves. It is far from you and not a direct threat.\n\n**Plan:**\nUP is the best move to immediately get the apple at (5,9). This increases your score to 8 and extends your lead. After eating, you can consider moving west to (4,9) to approach (3,9) or even (0,9). The apples at (4,5) and (3,2) are south and can be collected later. Since you are at the top, focusing on the top row apples is efficient.\n\nUP is safe and gets an apple. LEFT is safe but doesn't get an apple. RIGHT is safe but reduces future options (DOWN becomes unsafe next turn).\n\nTherefore, UP is optimal.\n\nUP",

If it moves UP to (0,9), it will eat that apple and grow to 7 apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nLEFT (to (4,9)) is highly beneficial because it gets you an apple immediately (increasing to 9 apples) and puts you in position to go for (3,9) next. This extends your lead over snake #0 (which might get to 7). RIGHT is safe but doesn't get an apple and doesn't progress your score.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\nLEFT",

But note: apples listed at (3,9), (4,5), (3,2), (1,0), (3,5) - so (4,9) was not an apple? Wait, check the board state: at row 9, column 4 is '1' (your head) and column 3 is 'A'. So (4,9) is your head and (3,9) is an apple. Last turn you moved LEFT from (5,9) to (4,9). There was no apple at (4,9) (since apples are at (3,9), etc.). So you did not eat an apple last turn. Therefore, your apples are still 9? But the scores say \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 9\". So it remains 9. Your body grew to 10 segments? Actually, your body is listed as 9 segments (head + 8 body parts) so length 9. Since you didn't eat, length remains 9.\n\n**Apples remaining:** (3,9), (4,5), (3,2), (1,0), (3,5) [Note: (4,9) was not an apple; (0,9) was eaten by snake #0?]\n\n**Enemy snake #0:**\n- Head at (0,9) (it moved UP from (0,8) to (0,9) and ate the apple there? So its apples are now 7, as listed.\n- Body: [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4)] (7 segments? Actually, it has 7 body parts? Head at (0,9) and body 7 segments? So total length 8? But apples collected is 7. So it grew to 8 segments.\n\n**Your current head at (4,9):**\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (4,10) - off board (die)\n- DOWN: (4,8) - empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (3,9) - apple (safe, and eating would grow you to length 10, apples=10)\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - your own body? Check: your body is [(5,9), (5,8), ...] so (5,9) is your body segment (the first body part). So moving RIGHT would hit yourself (die).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n- LEFT (3,9): This moves to an apple. Eating it would increase your apples to 10 and length to 10. After eating, you'll be at (3,9). From there, next moves: UP (off board), DOWN (3,8) (empty), LEFT (2,9) (empty), RIGHT (4,9) (which will be free after body shifts? But your body will be: head at (3,9), then (4,9), (5,9), ... so (4,9) is your body. So RIGHT would be unsafe. So after eating, you have DOWN and LEFT as safe? Also, (2,9) is empty. So DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\n- DOWN (4,8): This is safe and empty. From (4,8), next moves: UP (4,9) (your body? After move, body shifts: head to (4,8), then (4,9), (5,9), ... so (4,9) is body. So UP is unsafe. DOWN (4,7) (empty), LEFT (3,8) (empty), RIGHT (5,8) (empty). So three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:**\nIt is at (0,9). It has options: UP (off board), DOWN (0,8) (its body), LEFT (-1,9) off board, RIGHT (1,9) (empty). So only safe move is RIGHT to (1,9). So it will likely move RIGHT to (1,9).\n\n**Plan:**\nLEFT is very attractive because it gets an apple and increases your lead (10 vs 7). However, after eating, you are at (3,9) with only two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. This might be a bit restrictive, but you can plan to go down towards the center where there are more apples (like (3,5), (4,5), etc.).\n\nDOWN is safe and gives more immediate options (three directions). But it doesn't get an apple.\n\nGiven that you have a lead (9 vs 7) and snake #0 is moving to (1,9), it might come towards you. But you can avoid it.\n\nPrioritize eating: LEFT to get the apple and extend your lead. Then next turn, you can go DOWN to (3,8) to open up more options.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\n**Final move:**\nLEFT",

Actually after moving, my body will be: head (1, 8), then (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), \u2026 so (1, 9) will be my body next turn \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo from (1, 8) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nFrom (2, 9) next turn (if I survive collision risk):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 possibly enemy\u2019s old head location, but could be empty or enemy body depending on enemy move.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes LEFT to (2, 9) this turn, I die. If enemy goes DOWN to (3, 8), then (3, 9) is empty next turn.

Avoid risky head-on collisions.  \nDOWN to (1, 8) is completely safe this turn and keeps me alive.  \nFrom (1, 8), I can go DOWN toward (1, 0) apple eventually or RIGHT toward (4, 5) apple.  \n\nRIGHT to (2, 9) risks death if enemy chooses LEFT. Enemy might choose LEFT to block me or go for (3, 8) to go down toward (4, 5) apple.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer and more aggressive, better to play safe and avoid 50/50 death risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice**  \nDOWN is safe and keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 8), consider moving toward (1, 0) apple via DOWN moves, or toward center via RIGHT then DOWN.

Wait, apple at (3, 5) was listed last turn but not now. Actually current apples: (4, 5), (3, 2), (1, 0), (7, 6), (6, 6). So enemy didn't eat (3, 5) because it wasn't there last turn? Correction: last turn apples included (3, 5), now it's gone. So enemy must have moved from (3, 6) to (3, 5) last turn and ate it. Yes, that fits: enemy length increased by 1, now length 12.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (1, 5):**  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 my body \u2192 **no**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 empty  \n\nAll but UP are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (3, 5):**  \nEnemy possible:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 its body \u2192 **no**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 apple  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Collision risk this turn**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 5) and enemy goes LEFT to (2, 5) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 4) or LEFT to (0, 5), enemy\u2019s possible heads: (3, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5) \u2192 no overlap with (1, 4) or (0, 5) \u2192 safe.\n\nRIGHT is risky because enemy might go LEFT to eat apple at (4, 5)? Wait, enemy\u2019s RIGHT is (4, 5) apple, LEFT is (2, 5) empty. Enemy might prefer apple at (4, 5) over moving left, but if enemy thinks I might go RIGHT, it might move LEFT to kill us both. Since enemy is longer (12 vs 8), it might avoid head-on unless sure to kill me without dying. But simultaneous move means it can\u2019t know.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options**  \nFrom (1, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 empty next turn  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 empty  \nAll 4 safe next turn.\n\nFrom (0, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 my body (0, 7) is two away, so safe next turn? Wait, body: (0, 7) is part of my tail, but next turn tail moves if no apple eaten. Let\u2019s check: my tail is at (0, 7), head at (1, 5). If I move LEFT to (0, 5) and don\u2019t eat apple, tail moves from (0, 7) to (0, 8)? Actually my body: head (1,5), then (1,6),(1,7),(1,8),(1,9),(0,9),(0,8),(0,7). So tail is (0,7). Next turn if I move without eating, tail moves to (0,8) (since body follows). So (0,6) will be empty next turn. So from (0,5), UP to (0,6) safe next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 4) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 5) empty next turn  \nSo from (0,5), 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nFrom (2, 5):  \nIf enemy not there, then next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 6) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 4) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 5) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 5) empty (enemy old head)  \nAll 4 safe if alive.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple access**  \nClosest apple to me: (1, 0) is 5 steps down.  \n(3, 2) is 2 right, 3 down from (1,5).  \n(4,5) and (6,6),(7,6) are farther and near enemy.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I continue toward (1,0).  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,5), I go toward left wall, then down toward (1,0) but longer path.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I move toward (3,2) but risk collision.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nEnemy likely goes RIGHT to (4,5) to eat apple, or DOWN to (3,4) to chase (3,2) later.  \nLEFT for enemy to (2,5) is possible but less likely since apple at (4,5) is closer to it.  \nThus RIGHT for me might be safe if enemy goes RIGHT. But still a risk.\n\nGiven I\u2019m shorter, avoiding any chance of head-on is wise.  \nDOWN (1,4) is safe regardless of enemy move.  \nLEFT (0,5) is also safe but puts me against left wall with fewer future options.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4), continue DOWN toward (1,0) apple. Keep moving down column 1 until y=0, eat (1,0), then consider moving right along bottom to (3,2). Avoid center until enemy is elsewhere.\n\nDOWN",

So body: (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).

So enemy can only go UP/DOWN/RIGHT, moving away from (3,2). So (3,2) is safe to go for.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is longer, so avoid head-on. Need to grow to catch up.  \n(3,2) is the closest apple. UP from (2,0) gets me closer to it than RIGHT.  \nFrom (2,1) I can still access right-side apples later.  \n\nUP seems slightly better because:  \n- Puts me closer to (3,2) apple next turn.  \n- Avoids bottom row dead-end longer.  \n- Still have 2 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP now to (2,1).

Also, being at (3, 1) next turn allows eating (3, 2) and then moving to (3, 3) or (4, 2) to avoid trapping.  \nGoing UP now to (2, 2) still allows RIGHT next turn to (3, 2) apple, but then from (3, 2) after eating, my body will be longer and options might be limited by my own body.  \n\nActually, both are safe, but RIGHT now seems better for options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT now to (3, 1). Next turn, eat apple at (3, 2) if enemy not threatening it (likely safe). After eating, be careful not to box myself in; consider moving UP to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 2) depending on enemy position.  \n\nRIGHT",

We cannot go LEFT (body) or RIGHT (off board). Only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n- UP (9,3): Moves toward the apple at (9,8) and (8,8) in the long run. Also avoids immediate danger.\n- DOWN (9,1): Moves toward bottom edge, which has fewer apples and might lead to dead ends.\n\nWe should prioritize moving toward the cluster of apples at (7,6), (6,6), (8,8), and (8,4). UP is better for that.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy is at (3,2) and might move toward (4,2) or (3,3). We are far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After moving UP to (9,3), we should continue upward to target (9,8) or (8,8). Alternatively, we can later turn left to go toward (7,6) and (6,6). Avoid getting trapped in the top row. We have a lead (13 vs 9), so we should play safely and maintain our advantage.\n\nUP",
