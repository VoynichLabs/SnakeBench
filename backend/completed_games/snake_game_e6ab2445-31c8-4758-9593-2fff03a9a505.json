We can keep marching down each turn without ever running into ourselves.\n- It also leaves us **three follow\u2011up options** (left, right, down) for the next move \u2013 plenty of wiggle room.\n- The opponent is far away, heading up, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long\u2011term vision:**  \nSlide down the left side, scoop the low\u2011row apples (\u200b(1,\u202f0)\u200b,\u202f(0,\u202f3)\u200b), and force the rival into his own cramped hallway.

Plus we\u2019re stepping closer to the rival\u2019s turf, setting the stage for a future collision.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,6) grabs an apple instantly, but then the only safe move left is UP, shaving away our strategic flexibility.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 would slam us into our own segment at (6,5) \u2192 instant death.

Their legal moves this turn are **DOWN to (8,\u202f8)** or **LEFT to (7,\u202f9)**. No chance of a head\u2011on clash with any of our options.\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e Apple bounty**  \n- The apple at (9,\u202f1) is right on our doorstep. Grabbing it pushes us to **30\u202f% closer** to the rival\u2019s score while also **lengthening us**, giving us extra body to use as a barrier later.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Future freedom**  \n- From (9,\u202f1) we can keep climbing the right wall (UP to (9,\u202f2) next turn) or drop down to (9,\u202f0) for another apple. We\u2019ll still have multiple escape routes and can swing left higher up to start boxing the opponent along column\u202f8.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Risk assessment**  \n- No self\u2011collision, no opponent body, no off\u2011board move.  \n- No head\u2011on risk this turn.  \n- Growing now gives us a tactical edge for later \u201cwall\u2011trap\u201d maneuvers.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term plan**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f42 \u2192 RIGHT** to (9,\u202f1) and snag the apple.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn we\u2019ll decide whether to keep climbing the right edge or cut across to seal the opponent\u2019s descent.\n\n**\u2705 Bottom line:** The safest, most aggressive, point\u2011rich move is **RIGHT**.  \n\nRIGHT",

No head\u2011on danger.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Future freedom**  \n- From (9,\u202f3) we can keep climbing the right wall (UP again) or swing left later once the bottom\u2011row snake tail has cleared.  \n- Eating the apple at (9,\u202f5) will boost our score to 15, narrowing the gap with the opponent (who\u2019s about to vanish).  \n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Risk assessment**  \n- No self\u2011collision, no opponent collision, no wall.  \n- Guarantees at least two safe continuations next turn (UP again or LEFT once the corridor opens).  \n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term plan**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f44 \u2192 UP** to (9,\u202f3).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue UP to snag (9,\u202f5) and keep the opponent boxed out.\n\n**\u2705 Bottom line:** The safest, highest\u2011reward move is **UP**.  \n\nUP",

That cell is part of my own body, but it nudges me toward the opponent\u2019s x\u2011zone (he\u2019s hanging out near x=9). Not ideal when I want to keep him far away. \ud83e\udd28  \n- **LEFT**: would take me to (7,7). It\u2019s safe\u2011ish, but I\u2019m moving away from the low\u2011 hanging apple at (6,8) and into a more crowded part of my own coil. Do I really want to get trapped there? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \n- **DOWN**: lands on (8,6). That spot is currently occupied by a body segment that will vacate it this turn, so I survive. Plus, it puts me right next to the sweet apple at (8,5) \u2013 a perfect bite next turn! \ud83c\udf4e  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Strategic vibe**: I want to stay on the right\u2011hand side where the board is more open, keep my y\u2011coordinate high enough to avoid his low\u2011row crawl, and keep the rival\u2019s head from crossing my path. Moving down does exactly that while setting me up for an easy apple grab.  \n\n\u26a1\ufe0f **Long\u2011term note**: Stick to the right side, eat (8,5) next turn, then consider a gentle swing left toward (6,8) once I\u2019ve grown a bit more. Keep the pressure on Snake #1 and watch his up\u2011move to (9,3) \u2013 I\u2019ll stay out of his way.  \n\nDOWN",
