By moving RIGHT to (8,9), we open up the possibility of maneuvering (for example, by going RIGHT again to (9,9) or DOWN to (8,8)) to approach the apple at (9,7) in a few moves.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT keep us safely away from walls and other hazards. However, given that moving RIGHT helps us approach the apple on the far right (at (9,7)) and avoids any immediate risk of routing into our body, it is a strategic choice.\n\nThus, my next move is: RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Let's re-assess the current board from our perspective:\n\n\u2022 Our snake (ID 1) has its head at (8,8) and a single body segment at (8,9). We just moved DOWN on the last turn, so we can\u2019t reverse (i.e. UP would be illegal since that would be moving into our body).\n\n\u2022 Available directions from (8,8):\n\u2003\u2013 UP: (8,9) is off-limits because that\u2019s our body (and would be reversing).\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT: (7,8) is clear.\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT: (9,8) is clear.\n\u2003\u2013 DOWN: (8,7) is clear.\n\n\u2022 Now consider apple targets:\n\u2003\u2013 There\u2019s an apple at (7,7) and one at (9,7) (among others). Both of these become attractive after our next move.\n\u2003\u2013 From (8,8), moving DOWN gives us (8,7). Then (7,7) would only be one move to the left and (9,7) one move to the right.\n\u2003\u2013 Continuing the same direction (DOWN) also helps us maintain flexibility and keeps us away from walls.\n\nKeeping our survival and access to apples in mind, moving DOWN is a solid choice. It brings us closer to two apple targets while keeping our moves safe.\n\nSo, my next move is: DOWN."
