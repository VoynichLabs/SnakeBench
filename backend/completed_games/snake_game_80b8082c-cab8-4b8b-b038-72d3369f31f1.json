Looking at the board, I can see my current position marked as \"0\" and my tail marked as \"T\" at (0, 4).\n\nCurrent apples available:\n- (6, 0) - bottom right\n- (2, 5) - up and slightly right from me\n- (5, 4) - same row as me, to the right\n- (7, 3) - lower right\n- (3, 1) - lower right\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (9, 8) with body at [(8, 8)], still in the top-right area.\n\nFrom my current position (1, 4), my valid moves are:\n- UP to (1, 5) - moves toward apple at (2, 5)\n- DOWN to (1, 3) - moves away from immediate apples\n- LEFT to (0, 4) - would hit my own body (suicide)\n- RIGHT to (2, 4) - continues toward apple at (5, 4)\n\nStrategy analysis:\n1. The apple at (5, 4) is still on my same row - I can continue RIGHT to reach it efficiently\n2. The apple at (2, 5) is close - I could go UP then RIGHT to get it\n3. I need to choose between these two closest apples\n\nI think continuing RIGHT toward (5, 4) is the better choice because:\n- It's a straight line approach - no turns needed\n- After getting (5, 4), I'll have grown and can reassess other apple positions\n- The enemy snake is still far away in the top-right, so I'm not under immediate pressure\n- This keeps me in the middle area of the board with good mobility\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue moving RIGHT until I reach the apple at (5, 4). After collecting it, evaluate which remaining apple to target next, likely either (2, 5) or one of the lower apples depending on enemy snake movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Both are valid.\n\nStrategy to approach (7,3), which requires moving mostly left and down (current x=9 to 7 (left), y=8 to 3 (down)).\n\nBecause moving LEFT is currently blocked by my body at (8,8), I need to either first move UP or DOWN to clear the path.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,9), then the next turn I will be at (9,9) with body potentially at (9,8) depending on how the body grows.\n\nAlternatively, move DOWN to (9,7), then at next move, going left is possible.\n\nNote that if I go UP, I go further away from apple in the Y direction (current apple at y=3, I would be at y=9), but I might need space to go around my body segment.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,7), then next move LEFT to (8,7) is possible, then continue towards the apple at (7,3).\n\nSo moving DOWN seems more direct.\n\nNo enemy snakes nearby.\n\nSafe to move DOWN.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN\n\nStrategy after this move: move LEFT next turn and continue heading towards apple at (7,3).
