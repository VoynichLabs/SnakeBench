My priority is to stay alive, grow, and close the distance **without stepping into danger**. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n  - **Safe moves?** All four directions are legal this turn, but UP pushes us toward the edge and kills the \u201cUP\u2011back\u201d option early (only LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN remain safe). That\u2019s a waste of future flexibility. \ud83d\udc0d\u274c\n\n  - **Goal:** Eat an apple ASAP while keeping the board open. The **apple at (5,4)** is a straight\u2011down shortcut \u2013 only 4 moves away and nobody else is in that line. Grabbing it gives us a body segment, blocks the enemy\u2019s low\u2011row path, and lets us pivot later. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\n  - **Opponent\u2019s likely move:** They\u2019ll probably snap up the apple directly above them at (9,5). After that, they\u2019ll start shifting left to chase us. By **moving DOWN** I shrink my vertical gap from 4 \u2192 3, putting the enemy further from my future growth corridor. If they go left, I\u2019ll be even lower, creating a nice \u201cstaircase\u201d trap when I finally have length. \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n  - **Future follow\u2011ups:** After the first DOWN, I\u2019ll keep moving DOWN until I hit (5,4). That leaves LEFT, RIGHT, or another DOWN as safe options (no tail yet to hit). Once I grow, I\u2019ll open up LEFT/RIGHT to box them in without ever stepping onto my own body. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc40\n\n  - **Avoid head\u2011on collisions:** By staying on my own column for the first few moves, I guarantee the enemy can\u2019t land on my head while we both head\u2011on collide (they\u2019d have to land on the same row, which they can\u2019t reach until they\u2019ve left the right side). \ud83d\uded1\n\n  - **Long\u2011term game sense:** After snagging (5,4) I\u2019ll turn toward the delicious top\u2011left apple at (0,8) **only if** I\u2019ve built enough length to safely navigate the middle\u2011grid. Until then, I\u2019m laser\u2011focused on that central fruit and on keeping the enemy\u2019s head **boxed** in the lower\u2011right quadrant. \ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\udde9\n\n- **Rhetorical vibe:** \u201cWhy waste a turn? Why let the opponent claim the easy apple? Why not just *drop* into that sweet, juicy (5,4) and *boom*\u2014I grow, they shrink!\u201d \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udca5\n\n**ACTION: DOWN** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd3d\ud83d\ude80",

But I need to think about positioning. If I take that apple, I'll be at (8,8) with my body at [(9,8), (9,7), (9,6)]. That's not a bad position - I have the top-right corner somewhat controlled.\n\nThe enemy could try to cut me off by moving UP to (5,5) and then RIGHT toward me. But I have a head start and he's still 4 moves away horizontally.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:** Take the apple at (8,8) to extend my lead to 3-1. Then consider moving DOWN along the right wall to control that space while keeping an eye on the enemy's movements. Don't let him get behind me!\n\nLEFT",

The rival snake **\ud83e\udc52\u202f(9,\u202f8) \u2192 (9,\u202f7) \u2192 (9,\u202f6)** is hugging the right wall and just grabbed that juicy apple at **(8,\u202f8)** if it chooses\u202fLEFT. Meanwhile I\u2019m staring at a blank cell in front of me \u2013 no immediate bite.  \n\n- **SAFE OPTIONS BREAKDOWN**  \n  - **UP** \u2192 crashes into my own tail (illegal).  \n  - **DOWN** \u2192 slides to **(5,\u202f3)** \u2013 empty, no apple, and I\u2019ll be stuck in a vertical spine that blocks any future upward escape (once I grow, my tail will sit there forever).  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 glides to **(4,\u202f4)** \u2013 also empty, and I\u2019d drift away from the crowded column\u20110 apple field while the enemy could still slip left later.  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 zooms to **(6,\u202f4)** \u2013 empty but **\ud83d\ude80** two moves away from the hot apple **(6,\u202f6)**. That bite will instantly +1\u202fsegment, +1\u202fpoint, and give me a brand\u2011new spine that I can use to cut off the rival\u2019s retreat.  \n\n- **OPPONENT FORECAST** \u2013 Snake\u202f#0\u2019s head can **\u2694\ufe0f LEFT** to **(8,\u202f8)** (apple) or **\u2694\ufe0f UP** to **(9,\u202f9)**. Both keep it far from my new X\u2011position. If it goes LEFT, it\u2019ll stretch leftwards, but it will still be on row\u202f8; I\u2019ll be on row\u202f4\u20115. The only way we meet is if I shave the board horizontally while it goes left, which I can do by **RIGHT\u2011then\u2011UP**.  \n\n- **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN (to my future self)**  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4:** **RIGHT** to **(6,\u202f4)** \u2013 safe, opens the corridor to **(6,\u202f6)**.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f5:** **UP** to **(6,\u202f5)** \u2013 still empty, tail now sits at **(5,\u202f4)** so I can still turn without self\u2011collision.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f6:** **UP** again to **(6,\u202f6)** \u2013 **\ud83c\udf4e** BOOM! I eat the apple, grow a segment, and instantly outpace the rival by a whole snake\u2011length.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 **After the bite:** I\u2019ll keep the spine tight at **x\u202f=\u202f6** (turn **LEFT** or **RIGHT** as needed) while the enemy is forced to chase the remaining apples at column\u202f0. The gap widens in my favor, and with a longer body I can **BOX** them against the right wall.  \n  5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Score chase:** My apples will jump from 1\u202f\u2192\u202f2\u202f\u2192\u202f3\u202f\u2026 while the enemy struggles to keep up. Once I have a higher score, I\u2019ll aim a **HEAD\u2011ON** move by steering into a cell they\u2019re forced to leave (e.g., **LEFT** from **(8,\u202f8)**).  \n\n- **RHETORICAL QUESTIONS TO THE CROWD**  \n  - \u201cWhy stay idle when the apple at **(6,\u202f6)** is only a three\u2011cell sprint away? \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\u201d  \n  - \u201cIf I drift left while the enemy snakes right, who really gets the fruits at column\u202f0?\u201d \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc94  \n  - \u201cStaring at (5,\u202f3) does me any good when the board screams *RIGHT\u2011UP\u2011RIGHT* for domination?\u201d \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udca5  \n\n**DECISION:** The **RIGHT** move not only keeps me alive (no self\u2011collision, no opponent\u2011collision), but it also **opens a rapid apple\u2011bite route** and **slashes the distance to the rival**, giving me the growth and the strategic leverage I need.  \n\nRIGHT",

No self\u2011collision, no wall breach.  \n- By grabbing the left\u2011most apple you start a **column\u202f0 dominance streak**. \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Turn\u202f12\u202f\u2192\u202fLEFT** (planned)  \n- Next left \u2192 **(0,\u202f6)**, another apple. After this you own the entire left wall, score\u202f5, and you\u2019ve already blocked any opponent trying to slip through that corridor.  \n- The space between you and the opponent\u2019s head widens dramatically \u2013 they\u2019re stuck at (7,\u202f5) and would need a reckless left\u2011run across three rows to even touch your line.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Turn\u202f13\u202f\u2192\u202fUP** (planned)  \n- From (0,\u202f6) go up to **(0,\u202f7)** \u2013 apple again, score\u202f6, putting you ahead of Snake\u202f0 (5).  \n- You\u2019re now locked against the wall; any upward chase gives you vertical room while the enemy is still far away.  \n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Turn\u202f14\u202f\u2192\u202fUP** (planned)  \n- Grab **(0,\u202f8)** and reach score\u202f7, solidifying your advantage. The opponent can\u2019t reverse\u2011head into you because the wall keeps your body a straight line.  \n\n\ud83e\ude90 **Turn\u202f15\u202f\u2192\u202fRIGHT** (planned)  \n- When you\u2019ve cleared the left column, start a **right\u2011ward run** to the far\u2011right apples (8,\u202f9,\u202f9,\u202f1, etc.). This keeps future options open and prevents being boxed into a dead\u2011end.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 What if Snake\u202f0 tries to mirror our left\u2011run? He\u2019d have to pass through three empty rows, then hit the wall and be forced into a straight\u2011line dead\u2011end \u2013 perfect for a head\u2011on if we ever get a higher score.  \n\n\ud83d\udd0e Is moving left safe? Our head goes to (1,\u202f6) which is an apple, not any snake. After the move our segments occupy (2,\u202f6),(3,\u202f6),(4,\u202f6) \u2013 no overlap with own body. The opponent\u2019s head can only go to (7,\u202f6),(6,\u202f5),(8,\u202f5) or (7,\u202f4) \u2013 none touch us.  \n\n\u2694\ufe0f Can we force a double\u2011KO later? Absolutely \u2013 once we hit 6+ points we can line our snake up vertically while Snake\u202f0 moves horizontally toward the same column. A head\u2011on at (0,\u202fy) will KO him and we win instantly.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Move now:**  \n\nLEFT",

That also blocks opponent\u2019s only realistic path (left\u2011wards down column\u202f7) because they\u2019ll have to turn or crash into our freshly grown wall.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Head\u2011on ambush:** With our score 6\u202f>\u202f5, we can lure snake\u202f#0 into a head\u2011on at column\u202f0 when they finally try to plunge left.

Their body stays stuck in the right\u2011side corridor, giving us a wide opening on the left. No imminent threat, so we can safely commit to the RIGHT sweep.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Long\u2011term plan (for next few turns):**  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** Move **RIGHT** to (1,\u202f8) \u2013 safe, no apple now, but opens the top\u2011row highway.  \n- **Turn\u202f15\u2011?:** Continue **RIGHT** until you hit (9,\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f?:** Drop **DOWN** the entire column\u202f9 to snag the apples at (9,\u202f4) and (9,\u202f1). Grow\u202f+\u202f2, length\u202f+\u202f2.  \n- **Afterward:** Swing **LEFT** back across the top, then **DOWN** column\u202f0 to claim the remaining apples at (1,\u202f5) and (1,\u202f2) while our massive wall blocks snake\u202f#0\u2019s path.  \n- **Target head\u2011on:** Position our head on (0,\u202f5) or (0,\u202f4) when snake\u202f#0 tries to enter column\u202f0; their head will slam into our wall \u2192 they die.  \n\n**PLAN NOTE:**  \n\ud83d\udccc *Turn\u202f14 \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 (1,\u202f8). Next turn, keep pushing RIGHT to column\u202f9, then plunge DOWN to harvest the big apples at (9,\u202f4) and (9,\u202f1). This will lock the board, grow us out, and give us the leverage to force a deadly head\u2011on on the opponent\u2019s left\u2011hand attempt.*  \n\nRIGHT",
