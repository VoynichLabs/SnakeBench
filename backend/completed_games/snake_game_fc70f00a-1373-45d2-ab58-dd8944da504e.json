The enemy snake at (8, 2) is two steps away and cannot reach (6, 1) in one turn, so there is no immediate collision risk from the enemy for this move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (6,1), I will be right next to the apple at (6,0). My primary goal will be to eat this apple by moving DOWN to (6,0), provided it is safe (i.e., not occupied by another snake's head or body).\n\nMy next move is to approach the closest apple.\n\nDOWN"

Moving DOWN to (6,0) directly results in eating an apple. This is a high-priority move as it grants a point and increases length, potentially making future head-to-head collisions survivable if the opponent doesn't also eat an apple. From (8,1), the enemy is 3 steps away from (6,0) (|8-6|+|1-0|=3), so they cannot reach (6,0) in one turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,1) is an empty square. It does not yield an apple. It carries the risk of a head-to-head collision with the enemy if they choose to move LEFT from (8,1). The enemy's closest apple is (6,0) (distance 3) and then (1,2) or (8,9) (distance 8). Moving LEFT towards (7,1) is a valid step for the enemy to potentially reach (6,0).\n\nComparing the safe moves, moving DOWN to (6,0) is the optimal choice. It secures an apple safely and increases my score/length.\n\nMy next move is to eat the apple at (6,0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (6,0), my head will be at (6,0) and my body will be [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. I will have grown longer. I will then need to assess the board state from (6,0), find the next closest apple among (0, 9), (5, 9), (1, 2), and (8, 9), and navigate towards it while avoiding the enemy snake and my own growing body.\n\nDOWN"

It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head or body segments. Moving here is safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): This cell is within bounds and currently appears empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's visible body). The enemy head is at (8, 0).

Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe for me.\n\nSafe moves considering walls, self-collision (assuming tail rule), and head-to-head outcomes: LEFT, RIGHT.\nUnsafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow considering apples and enemy positions:\nNone of the available moves directly lead to an apple this turn. The closest apple is at (1,2), 7 steps away via a path that would involve moving LEFT.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): This positions me at (5,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 6 steps away (|5-1|+|0-2| = 4+2=6). Moving LEFT seems to be a step towards the closest apple, although further navigation avoiding my body segments (e.g., at (5,1) and (5,2)) is required. This move is safe and maintains distance from the enemy head at (8,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This positions me at (7,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 8 steps away (|7-1|+|0-2|=6+2=8). Apples at (9,7) (dist 9) and (8,9) (dist 10) are also relatively close and in this general direction. This move carries the potential for a head-to-head collision with the enemy at (7,0) if they move LEFT from (8,0). Given my length advantage (6 vs 5), I would survive this encounter, eliminating the enemy snake. This is a strong strategic advantage. If the enemy does not move LEFT (e.g., moves RIGHT to (9,0)), I still occupy a safe square.\n\nThe potential to eliminate the enemy snake safely is a significant advantage in a multi-snake game. By moving RIGHT, I force a potentially fatal confrontation for the enemy if they choose to move LEFT towards me. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT is still safe. Moving LEFT leads me towards the closest apple but keeps the enemy alive and active.\n\nGiven the opportunity to eliminate the enemy without risk to myself, moving RIGHT is the strategically preferred move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7,0):\n- If the enemy moved LEFT: The enemy is eliminated. My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. I will be the only snake remaining. I should find the closest remaining apple and navigate towards it, avoiding my own body.\n- If the enemy did not move LEFT (e.g., moved RIGHT): My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. The enemy is still on the board (e.g., head at (9,0)). I need to find the closest apple (likely (1,2), (9,7) or (8,9)) and navigate towards it while keeping track of the enemy's position and avoiding collisions.\n\nMy next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

Moving LEFT towards (7,1) is a valid step for the enemy to potentially reach (6,0).\n\nComparing the safe moves, moving DOWN to (6,0) is the optimal choice.

It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head or body segments. Moving here is safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): This cell is within bounds and currently appears empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's visible body). The enemy head is at (8, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7,0) while the enemy moves LEFT to (7,0) would cause a head-to-head collision at (7,0). My current length is 6 and the enemy length is 5.

Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe for me.\n\nSafe moves considering walls, self-collision (assuming tail rule), and head-to-head outcomes: LEFT, RIGHT.\nUnsafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow considering apples and enemy positions:\nNone of the available moves directly lead to an apple this turn. The closest apple is at (1,2), 7 steps away via a path that would involve moving LEFT.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): This positions me at (5,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 6 steps away (|5-1|+|0-2| = 4+2=6). Moving LEFT seems to be a step towards the closest apple, although further navigation avoiding my body segments (e.g., at (5,1) and (5,2)) is required. This move is safe and maintains distance from the enemy head at (8,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This positions me at (7,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 8 steps away (|7-1|+|0-2|=6+2=8). Apples at (9,7) (dist 9) and (8,9) (dist 10) are also relatively close and in this general direction. This move carries the potential for a head-to-head collision with the enemy at (7,0) if they move LEFT from (8,0). Given my length advantage (6 vs 5), I would survive this encounter, eliminating the enemy snake. This is a strong strategic advantage. If the enemy does not move LEFT (e.g., moves RIGHT to (9,0)), I still occupy a safe square.\n\nThe potential to eliminate the enemy snake safely is a significant advantage in a multi-snake game. By moving RIGHT, I force a potentially fatal confrontation for the enemy if they choose to move LEFT towards me. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT is still safe. Moving LEFT leads me towards the closest apple but keeps the enemy alive and active.\n\nGiven the opportunity to eliminate the enemy without risk to myself, moving RIGHT is the strategically preferred move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7,0):\n- If the enemy moved LEFT: The enemy is eliminated. My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. I will be the only snake remaining. I should find the closest remaining apple and navigate towards it, avoiding my own body.\n- If the enemy did not move LEFT (e.g., moved RIGHT): My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. The enemy is still on the board (e.g., head at (9,0)).

Moving DOWN to (6,0) directly results in eating an apple. This is a high-priority move as it grants a point and increases length, potentially making future head-to-head collisions survivable if the opponent doesn't also eat an apple. From (8,1), the enemy is 3 steps away from (6,0) (|8-6|+|1-0|=3), so they cannot reach (6,0) in one turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,1) is an empty square. It does not yield an apple. It carries the risk of a head-to-head collision with the enemy if they choose to move LEFT from (8,1). The enemy's closest apple is (6,0) (distance 3) and then (1,2) or (8,9) (distance 8). Moving LEFT towards (7,1) is a valid step for the enemy to potentially reach (6,0).\n\nComparing the safe moves, moving DOWN to (6,0) is the optimal choice. It secures an apple safely and increases my score/length.\n\nMy next move is to eat the apple at (6,0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (6,0), my head will be at (6,0) and my body will be [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. I will have grown longer. I will then need to assess the board state from (6,0), find the next closest apple among (0, 9), (5, 9), (1, 2), and (8, 9), and navigate towards it while avoiding the enemy snake and my own growing body.\n\nDOWN"

Enemy length is 5.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from my current head position (6, 0):\n- UP to (6, 1): This cell is occupied by my neck segment. Moving here would result in a self-collision. This move is unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, -1): This is outside the board boundary (y < 0). Moving here would result in a wall collision. This move is unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 0): This cell is occupied by my tail segment. In most Snake variants, moving onto your tail is safe because the tail segment moves away before the head occupies the square. Assuming this rule, this move is safe from self-collision. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head or body segments. Moving here is safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): This cell is within bounds and currently appears empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's visible body). The enemy head is at (8, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7,0) while the enemy moves LEFT to (7,0) would cause a head-to-head collision at (7,0). My current length is 6 and the enemy length is 5. Since I am longer, I would survive this collision and the enemy would die. Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe for me.\n\nSafe moves considering walls, self-collision (assuming tail rule), and head-to-head outcomes: LEFT, RIGHT.\nUnsafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow considering apples and enemy positions:\nNone of the available moves directly lead to an apple this turn. The closest apple is at (1,2), 7 steps away via a path that would involve moving LEFT.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): This positions me at (5,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 6 steps away (|5-1|+|0-2| = 4+2=6). Moving LEFT seems to be a step towards the closest apple, although further navigation avoiding my body segments (e.g., at (5,1) and (5,2)) is required. This move is safe and maintains distance from the enemy head at (8,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This positions me at (7,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 8 steps away (|7-1|+|0-2|=6+2=8). Apples at (9,7) (dist 9) and (8,9) (dist 10) are also relatively close and in this general direction. This move carries the potential for a head-to-head collision with the enemy at (7,0) if they move LEFT from (8,0). Given my length advantage (6 vs 5), I would survive this encounter, eliminating the enemy snake. This is a strong strategic advantage. If the enemy does not move LEFT (e.g., moves RIGHT to (9,0)), I still occupy a safe square.\n\nThe potential to eliminate the enemy snake safely is a significant advantage in a multi-snake game. By moving RIGHT, I force a potentially fatal confrontation for the enemy if they choose to move LEFT towards me. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT is still safe. Moving LEFT leads me towards the closest apple but keeps the enemy alive and active.\n\nGiven the opportunity to eliminate the enemy without risk to myself, moving RIGHT is the strategically preferred move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7,0):\n- If the enemy moved LEFT: The enemy is eliminated. My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. I will be the only snake remaining. I should find the closest remaining apple and navigate towards it, avoiding my own body.\n- If the enemy did not move LEFT (e.g., moved RIGHT): My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. The enemy is still on the board (e.g., head at (9,0)). I need to find the closest apple (likely (1,2), (9,7) or (8,9)) and navigate towards it while keeping track of the enemy's position and avoiding collisions.\n\nMy next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

Moving DOWN to (6,0) directly results in eating an apple. This is a high-priority move as it grants a point and increases length, potentially making future head-to-head collisions survivable if the opponent doesn't also eat an apple. From (8,1), the enemy is 3 steps away from (6,0) (|8-6|+|1-0|=3), so they cannot reach (6,0) in one turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,1) is an empty square. It does not yield an apple.

Moving LEFT towards (7,1) is a valid step for the enemy to potentially reach (6,0).\n\nComparing the safe moves, moving DOWN to (6,0) is the optimal choice. It secures an apple safely and increases my score/length.\n\nMy next move is to eat the apple at (6,0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (6,0), my head will be at (6,0) and my body will be [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)]. I will have grown longer. I will then need to assess the board state from (6,0), find the next closest apple among (0, 9), (5, 9), (1, 2), and (8, 9), and navigate towards it while avoiding the enemy snake and my own growing body.\n\nDOWN"

This move is unsafe.\n- DOWN to (6, -1): This is outside the board boundary (y < 0). Moving here would result in a wall collision. This move is unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 0): This cell is occupied by my tail segment. In most Snake variants, moving onto your tail is safe because the tail segment moves away before the head occupies the square. Assuming this rule, this move is safe from self-collision. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head or body segments. Moving here is safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): This cell is within bounds and currently appears empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's visible body). The enemy head is at (8, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7,0) while the enemy moves LEFT to (7,0) would cause a head-to-head collision at (7,0). My current length is 6 and the enemy length is 5. Since I am longer, I would survive this collision and the enemy would die. Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe for me.\n\nSafe moves considering walls, self-collision (assuming tail rule), and head-to-head outcomes: LEFT, RIGHT.\nUnsafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow considering apples and enemy positions:\nNone of the available moves directly lead to an apple this turn. The closest apple is at (1,2), 7 steps away via a path that would involve moving LEFT.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): This positions me at (5,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 6 steps away (|5-1|+|0-2| = 4+2=6). Moving LEFT seems to be a step towards the closest apple, although further navigation avoiding my body segments (e.g., at (5,1) and (5,2)) is required. This move is safe and maintains distance from the enemy head at (8,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This positions me at (7,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 8 steps away (|7-1|+|0-2|=6+2=8). Apples at (9,7) (dist 9) and (8,9) (dist 10) are also relatively close and in this general direction. This move carries the potential for a head-to-head collision with the enemy at (7,0) if they move LEFT from (8,0). Given my length advantage (6 vs 5), I would survive this encounter, eliminating the enemy snake. This is a strong strategic advantage. If the enemy does not move LEFT (e.g., moves RIGHT to (9,0)), I still occupy a safe square.\n\nThe potential to eliminate the enemy snake safely is a significant advantage in a multi-snake game. By moving RIGHT, I force a potentially fatal confrontation for the enemy if they choose to move LEFT towards me. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT is still safe. Moving LEFT leads me towards the closest apple but keeps the enemy alive and active.\n\nGiven the opportunity to eliminate the enemy without risk to myself, moving RIGHT is the strategically preferred move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7,0):\n- If the enemy moved LEFT: The enemy is eliminated. My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. I will be the only snake remaining. I should find the closest remaining apple and navigate towards it, avoiding my own body.\n- If the enemy did not move LEFT (e.g., moved RIGHT): My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. The enemy is still on the board (e.g., head at (9,0)). I need to find the closest apple (likely (1,2), (9,7) or (8,9)) and navigate towards it while keeping track of the enemy's position and avoiding collisions.\n\nMy next move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

Moving here is safe.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): This cell is within bounds and currently appears empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's visible body). The enemy head is at (8, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7,0) while the enemy moves LEFT to (7,0) would cause a head-to-head collision at (7,0). My current length is 6 and the enemy length is 5.

The closest apple is at (1,2), 7 steps away via a path that would involve moving LEFT.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): This positions me at (5,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 6 steps away (|5-1|+|0-2| = 4+2=6). Moving LEFT seems to be a step towards the closest apple, although further navigation avoiding my body segments (e.g., at (5,1) and (5,2)) is required. This move is safe and maintains distance from the enemy head at (8,0).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): This positions me at (7,0). From here, the closest apple at (1,2) is 8 steps away (|7-1|+|0-2|=6+2=8). Apples at (9,7) (dist 9) and (8,9) (dist 10) are also relatively close and in this general direction. This move carries the potential for a head-to-head collision with the enemy at (7,0) if they move LEFT from (8,0). Given my length advantage (6 vs 5), I would survive this encounter, eliminating the enemy snake. This is a strong strategic advantage. If the enemy does not move LEFT (e.g., moves RIGHT to (9,0)), I still occupy a safe square.\n\nThe potential to eliminate the enemy snake safely is a significant advantage in a multi-snake game. By moving RIGHT, I force a potentially fatal confrontation for the enemy if they choose to move LEFT towards me. Even if they don't, moving RIGHT is still safe. Moving LEFT leads me towards the closest apple but keeps the enemy alive and active.\n\nGiven the opportunity to eliminate the enemy without risk to myself, moving RIGHT is the strategically preferred move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (7,0):\n- If the enemy moved LEFT: The enemy is eliminated. My head is at (7,0), body [(6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. I will be the only snake remaining.

The enemy is still on the board (e.g., head at (9,0)).

            "rationale": "My current position is (7, 2) with body at [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. My length is 6.\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 2) with body [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]. Enemy length is 5.\nApples are at (0, 9), (5, 9), (1, 2), (8, 9), (9, 7).\n\nPossible moves from (7, 2):\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** This square is empty, within bounds, and safe from enemy collision. Safe move.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** This is my neck segment. Moving here is self-collision. Unsafe move.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** This is my tail segment (the last in the body list). Since I am not moving onto an apple at (6, 2), my tail will vacate this square in the next turn. Moving here is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** This square is currently empty. The enemy snake is at (9, 2). If the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 2) and I move RIGHT to (8, 2), it's a head-to-head collision. My length (6) is greater than the enemy's length (5), so I would win this collision. This move is safe in that it doesn't result in my death, but it involves a collision and potential risk calculation.\n\nSafe moves are UP to (7, 3) and LEFT to (6, 2). Moving RIGHT is also technically 'safe' as I win a head-to-head, but avoiding collisions is generally preferable if other safe options exist.\n\nLet's consider the nearest apples:\n- (1, 2) is at Manhattan distance |7-1| + |2-2| = 6.\n- (9, 7) is at Manhattan distance |7-9| + |2-7| = 7.\n- (8, 9) is at Manhattan distance |7-8| + |2-9| = 8.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 2) puts me at distance |6-1| + |2-2| = 5 from the (1, 2) apple.\nMoving UP to (7, 3) puts me at distance |7-1| + |3-2| = 7 from the (1, 2) apple, but distance |7-9| + |3-7| = 6 from the (9, 7) apple.\n\nMoving LEFT leads me directly towards the closest apple (1, 2) and also moves me away from the enemy snake located near (9, 2). This seems like the optimal strategic move. Moving UP moves me towards the top of the board where more apples are, but also potentially closer to the enemy's side of the board later on.\n\nThe move LEFT to (6, 2) is safe (moving onto the vacating tail spot) and progresses towards the closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT to (6,2), my head will be at (6,2) and my body will be [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]. My length is still 6. I will evaluate moves from (6,2) and continue moving towards the apple at (1,2) as long as the path remains safe from walls, my body, and the enemy. The path (6,2) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) appears open.\n\nMy decision is to move LEFT.\n\nLEFT"
