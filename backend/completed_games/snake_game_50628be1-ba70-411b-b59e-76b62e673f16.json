The closest apple is at (8, 4), only 6 moves away.\n4. To get to (8, 4), I need to go RIGHT 3 times, then DOWN 5 times.\n5. There is one enemy snake at (6, 9) with no body, so it should be safe to move right for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to get the apple at (8, 4), I should reevaluate the board state and move towards the next closest apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
