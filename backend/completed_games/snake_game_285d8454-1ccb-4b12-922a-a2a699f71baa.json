This keeps my head at distance from the enemy snake at (6,0).\n\n- RIGHT (to (7,2)): Empty cell, reasonable separation from the enemy, and it's the same row as an apple at (7,5), which could be a path toward that.\n\n- UP (to (6,3)): Empty cell, slightly moving away from the enemy snake, and there are apples along rows 7 and 8 that I can aim for.\n\n- DOWN (to (6,1)): Empty cell, and doing this would bring me to the same column as the enemy snake at (6,0), putting us directly vertical to each other, which could set up a head-on risk if it moves up.\n\nConsidering safety and strategy, I should avoid moves that put me too close to the enemy snake or risk immediate collisions. The enemy snake is at (6,0), so moving DOWN to (6,1) would stack us vertically, potentially leading to a collision risk next move. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would keep me separated horizontally. RIGHT moves me toward an apple at (7,5) and also slightly futher from the enemy. LEFT achieves separation as well.\n\nOption RIGHT (7,2) also has good follow-up moves: I could continue right, go up toward the apple cluster, or even down if needed, so that keeps future options open and progresses toward apples.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nNext turn I should consider continuing RIGHT toward the apple at (7,5) or beginning to move UP toward the cluster of apples around (3,7), (2,8), (0,7).

This is extremely favorable - I'd collect my first apple, grow by one segment, and score a point.\n- **DOWN to (7, 3)**: Empty cell, safe move but moves me away from the nearest apple.\n- **LEFT to (6, 4)**: Empty cell, safe move but takes me away from the apple cluster.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 4)**: Empty cell, safe move but also moves me away from the nearest apple.\n\nSafety analysis: All four directions are safe - no risk of going off-board or hitting myself (no body segments yet). The enemy snake is at (8, 1), which is well away from my immediate movement area.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP gives me immediate apple collection and growth\n- The apple at (7, 5) is the closest apple to me\n- Moving UP continues the logical path toward apple collection\n- After collecting this apple, I'll have more options for pursuing other nearby apples\n\n**NEXT MOVE PLAN**\nMove UP to collect the apple at (7, 5). This will give me my first point and grow my snake by one segment. After collecting this apple, assess the board state to determine whether to pursue the apple at (9, 1) to the right or consider moving toward the cluster of apples in the top-left area. Continue maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake at (8, 1).\n\nUP",

Eating it now would be good for score.  \nAlso (7, 5) is close in terms of enemy possibly eating it next turn if they go UP.  \n\n**Future mobility after each move:**  \n- RIGHT to (9, 1): eat apple, next turn I\u2019ll have body segment at (9, 1) and head at (9, 1) \u2014 no, wait: after eating, the new head position is (9, 1), body segment at old head (8, 1). Next turn from (9, 1): possible moves: UP (9, 2), DOWN (9, 0), LEFT (8, 1) \u2014 but (8, 1) will be my body next turn, so LEFT is deadly. So only UP and DOWN safe. That\u2019s a bit limiting \u2014 corner situation.  \n\n- UP to (8, 2): next turn from (8, 2): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe unless enemy moves there. Keeps options open.  \n\n- DOWN to (8, 0): next turn from (8, 0): UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe (DOWN off board). Still okay.  \n\n- LEFT to (7, 1): next turn from (7, 1): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all safe unless enemy blocks. But enemy at (7, 4) could move toward that area soon.  \n\n**Risk of enemy cutting path:**  \nIf enemy eats apple at (7, 5), they grow and might move toward center. Being at (9, 1) after eating apple is risky because of limited moves.  \n\n**Best choice:**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple but reduces future mobility.  \nUP moves toward center and multiple apples while keeping options open.  \nSince it\u2019s early game, keeping mobility is more important than rushing for an apple that puts me in a corner.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward center to maintain mobility, target apples (0,7) or (2,8) or (3,7) via left/up moves. Avoid letting enemy trap me.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

None threaten my possible destinations this turn except maybe head-on at exactly the same cell. No overlap here.  \n\n**Option analysis:**  \n- RIGHT (9, 0): eat apple, gain point. Next turn from (9, 0): possible moves: UP (9, 1) \u2014 empty, LEFT (8, 0) \u2014 will become tail after growth? Wait \u2014 careful: if I eat apple at (9, 0), my tail will be at (8, 0) next turn, so moving back to (8, 0) would kill me next turn (hitting my tail segment). So from (9, 0) next moves: UP \u2192 safe, LEFT \u2192 unsafe (tail), DOWN \u2192 off board. So only one safe move: UP (9, 1). That\u2019s dangerously limiting \u2014 risky.  \n\n- LEFT (7, 0): empty, central area. Next turn from (7, 0): UP, RIGHT, possibly DOWN if on board? Actually (7, 0) \u2014 UP (7, 1), DOWN (7, -1) invalid, so only UP and RIGHT? Also LEFT (6, 0) valid. So UP, LEFT, RIGHT = 3 moves. Good mobility, but no apple.  \n\n- UP (8, 1): empty, central. Next turn from (8, 1): UP (8, 2), LEFT (7, 1), RIGHT (9, 1) (apple there), possibly DOWN back to (8, 0) \u2014 safe next turn? Yes, since no body yet. Actually after this move, still no body; so all directions safe except off-board edges. Wait at (8,1): DOWN (8,0) off board? No, (8,0) is valid \u2014 just empty. But next turn after moving UP now, I still have no tail, so moving back to (8,0) is fine. Actually at (8,1) possibilities: UP (8,2), RIGHT (9,1), LEFT (7,1), DOWN (8,0) \u2192 all safe. So UP now gives 4 options next turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nIf I go UP now, next turn from (8, 1) I can go RIGHT to (9, 1) for apple while keeping mobility. Eating now at (9, 0) limits me badly. So better to defer apple until next turn when I can eat more safely without trapping.  \n\nDecision: UP keeps mobility high, then eat (9, 1) next turn for a body while maintaining escape routes.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nUP now \u2192 (8, 1)  \nNext turn: eat (9, 1) if still safe, else move toward center/other apples while avoiding dead-ends. Avoid getting stuck along top edge.  \n\nLEFT also okay but farther from apples; UP is closer to apple (9, 1).  \n\nFinal choice: UP.  \n\n**END NEW MOVE PICK**  \n\nUP",

Possible moves from (9,1): UP (9,2), DOWN (9,0) \u2014 but (9,0) is empty then? Wait, apple at (9,0) still present unless eaten this turn \u2014 but after eating apple, apple disappears. So (9,0) is empty next turn. Then from (9,1): UP, DOWN both safe, LEFT unsafe, RIGHT off-board. So 2 options next turn. But (9,2) and (9,0) are both edges; I risk being cornered.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (6,7) could move: UP (6,8), LEFT (5,7), DOWN (6,6), RIGHT (7,7) its body \u2014 unsafe for enemy? Wait, enemy\u2019s body is at (7,7), so enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT into its body. Possible enemy moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN. None threaten my possible head positions this turn directly (no shared cells).  \n\n**Option analysis:**  \n- RIGHT: immediate apple, but next turn limited to UP/DOWN along right edge \u2014 risky for future mobility.  \n- UP: (8,2) \u2014 central, safe, keeps many options open. From (8,2) next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all valid and likely empty.  \n- LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 central, safe, good mobility.  \n- DOWN: (8,0) \u2014 bottom edge, reduces options slightly (can\u2019t go further DOWN).  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nI want to avoid trapping myself early. Right edge is dangerous after eating (9,1). Better to eat (9,1) only when I have an escape path \u2014 maybe next turn from (8,1) go RIGHT then, but this turn going UP or LEFT sets up better. Actually, if I go UP now to (8,2), next turn I can still consider eating (9,1) via RIGHT from (8,2)? No, from (8,2) going RIGHT is (9,2), not (9,1). So to eat (9,1), I must be at (8,1) or (9,0) or (9,2)? Wait, from (8,1) RIGHT is (9,1). So only from (8,1) or (9,0) UP or (9,2) DOWN. So if I leave (8,1) now without eating, I might lose that apple to enemy? Enemy far away, apple (9,1) safe for now.  \n\nBest: UP to (8,2) for mobility, then plan route to (9,1) via (8,2)\u2192(9,2)\u2192(9,1)? That\u2019s 2 turns; risky if enemy approaches. But enemy is near top-left apples, not near (9,1).  \n\nAlternatively, LEFT to (7,1) toward center, more flexibility to access multiple apples later.  \n\nI think UP is slightly better than LEFT because it keeps me closer to (9,1) while avoiding edge trap.  \n\n**Decision:** UP to (8,2) maintains options and safety.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8,2), consider moving to (9,2) then (9,1) to eat apple if safe, or go toward center via (7,2) etc. Avoid dead-ends.

Eating it would grow me to length 2 (head + 1 body segment).\n\n**Safety check:**\nAll four moves are safe \u2014 no walls, no bodies, no enemy heads adjacent.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nRIGHT leads directly to apple (9, 1). That\u2019s the closest apple.  \nDOWN leads to (8, 0), which is next to apple (9, 0).\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nEnemy #1 is far away at (4, 7), moving near apples (3, 7), (2, 8), (0, 7). No immediate danger.\n\n**Mobility after each move:**\n- RIGHT (9, 1): after eating apple, my body will be at (8, 1). Next turn from (9, 1), possible moves: UP (9, 2), DOWN (9, 0), LEFT (8, 1) \u2014 but LEFT is into my new body segment, so not safe. So only UP and DOWN would be safe.

That\u2019s dangerous if enemy approaches later.  \nDOWN keeps me safe with more options and still close to apple (9, 0) for next turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nEven though RIGHT gets an apple immediately, it reduces future mobility significantly. Since the game is long (150 turns), survival and maintaining mobility is more important than grabbing the first apple if it risks trapping.  \nBetter to go DOWN to (8, 0), then next turn RIGHT to (9, 0) for apple, keeping more escape routes.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (8, 0), next turn go RIGHT to (9, 0) to eat apple, then possibly UP to (9, 1) if still there, but be cautious about getting stuck on right edge.\n\nDOWN",

Eating it would grow me to length 2.\n\n**Safety check:**\nAll four moves are safe \u2014 no bodies, no enemy heads adjacent, all within board.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nRIGHT leads directly to apple (9, 1).  \nUP moves toward apple (8, 8) long-term.  \nDOWN and LEFT move away from apples.\n\n**Mobility after each move:**\n- RIGHT (9, 1): after eating apple, my body will be at (8, 1). Next turn from (9, 1), possible moves: UP (9, 2), DOWN (9, 0), LEFT (8, 1) \u2014 into my body (not safe). So only UP and DOWN would be safe \u2014 still decent options.\n- UP (8, 2): next turn from (8, 2), moves: UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2) \u2014 all safe. Excellent mobility.\n- DOWN (8, 0): next turn from (8, 0), moves: UP (8, 1), LEFT (7, 0), RIGHT (9, 0) \u2014 all safe. Good mobility but away from apples.\n- LEFT (7, 1): next turn from (7, 1), moves: UP (7, 2), DOWN (7, 0), LEFT (6, 1), RIGHT (8, 1) \u2014 all safe. Good mobility but away from apples.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nRIGHT gets an apple but puts me on the edge with slightly reduced mobility next turn \u2014 but not critically trapped.  \nUP keeps me central with maximum mobility and moves toward other apples.  \nEnemy #1 is far away at (2, 7) \u2014 no immediate threat.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT gives immediate apple gain, which is valuable since enemy #1 already has 2 apples. The mobility reduction after eating is manageable \u2014 I\u2019d still have 2 safe moves next turn.  \nUP is safer long-term but delays apple collection.  \nGiven the scoring gap, I should prioritize catching up in apples sooner.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating apple at (9, 1), next turn choose UP or DOWN to avoid trapping myself. Aim to move toward center afterward to regain mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

This would give me my 4th apple and grow my snake.\n\nSafety analysis: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe moves. LEFT is immediately fatal.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- I lead with 3 apples vs snake #0's 1 apple\n- I'm positioned at (7, 8), just 1 cell away from the apple at (8, 8)\n- RIGHT move directly collects the apple at (8, 8)\n- This maintains my lead and grows my snake\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. This turn: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to collect the apple and grow to 5 segments\n2. Next turn: From (8, 8) after growing, evaluate nearby apples - (5, 5) and (1, 5) are potential targets to the south/west\n3. Consider moving DOWN or LEFT after collecting to pursue (5, 5) or maintain board control\n4. Continue maintaining my lead over snake #0 who is at (9, 2) and may be heading toward (9, 0)\n\nThe RIGHT move is optimal - it collects an apple, grows my snake, and maintains good strategic positioning.\n\nRIGHT",

UP and RIGHT are immediately fatal.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- I lead with 4 apples vs snake #0's 1 apple\n- The apple at (6, 7) is directly adjacent to my left - this is the closest apple\n- Snake #0 is at (6, 2), which is quite far from (6, 7) - it would take at least 5 moves\n- Collecting (6, 7) increases my lead to 5 apples\n- After collecting (6, 7), the nearby apples at (5, 5) and (1, 5) become attractive targets\n- The apple at (0, 7) is on the far left edge, and (9, 0) is in the bottom-right corner\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. This turn: Move LEFT to (6, 7) to collect the apple - this is the optimal move\n2. After growing, my body will be longer, so I need to plan safe escape routes\n3. Next target: (5, 5) is 3 moves away from (6, 7) - very accessible\n4. Alternatively, (1, 5) is also nearby but requires careful pathing through columns 2-5\n5. Keep monitoring snake #0 at (6, 2) - it may head toward (9, 0) or try to challenge for (5, 5)\n\nThe LEFT move is clearly optimal - it collects the adjacent apple at (6, 7), increasing my score by 1, while positioning me for future apple collection. This maintains my significant lead over snake #0.\n\nLEFT",

So 4 safe follow-ups.\n- **DOWN (4, 2)**: Moves toward apple (7, 2) but less directly. Next turn from (4, 2): UP (4, 3) (my body? No, body is at (5, 3) now, so OK), DOWN (4, 1), LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2) (empty) \u2014 all safe \u2192 4 safe moves.\n- **LEFT (3, 3)**: Toward apple (1, 5).

Then its body will extend next turn. If I go UP to (4, 4), next turn I can go to (4, 5) or (5, 4) but not (5, 5) \u2014 enemy now occupies it. No head-on risk since enemy just ate and is now longer.\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nLow risk of head-on collision this turn. Path to (5, 5) is blocked by enemy if enemy moves there this turn. But enemy might not go there if it thinks I'm competing? But my length is 2 vs its 6, so enemy may not worry.\n\n**Choice:**\nUP puts me close to (5, 5) but enemy might take it.  \nDOWN or LEFT are safer but farther from apples.  \n\nGiven my long-term plan to avoid enemy while collecting apples, the best path is to aim for apple (1, 5) via LEFT, then UP. That keeps me away from the strong enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue toward apple (1, 5) via (3, 3) \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 (1, 5).

Wait \u2014 looking at the board, apple is at (7,2)? No, the apples listed are (0,7), (9,0), (1,8), (4,5), (9,9). The board shows '1' at (7,2) which is the enemy head. So no apple is directly next to the enemy. It might move towards the center apple at (4,5) or the (9,9) apple. Still, it's far from my position in the top-left.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the best move. It consumes the closest apple in the fewest moves and keeps me in a safe area.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Next turn, move UP to (1, 8) to eat the apple. Then reassess.

Safe to eat. Eating this apple will grow my tail next turn.\n- **LEFT**: Off board (x=-1). Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT (1, 8)**: My body. Unsafe.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **UP (0, 9)**: Moves to the top-left corner. From (0, 9), next turn options: DOWN (0, 8) body (unsafe), RIGHT (1, 9) empty. Only one safe move next turn, which is risky.\n- **DOWN (0, 7)**: Eats the apple. From (0, 7), next turn options: UP (0, 8) body (unsafe), RIGHT (1, 7) body (unsafe), LEFT off board (unsafe). No safe moves next turn after eating\u2014this is a trap.\n\n**Problem:** Both safe moves lead to positions with only one safe follow-up move. DOWN leads to immediate death next turn after eating the apple.\n\n**Re-checking body coordinates:** My body is [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. After moving DOWN to (0, 7) and eating, my body becomes [(0, 7), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)]. Next turn from (0, 7):\n- UP (0, 8): occupied by my body (segment from old head).\n- DOWN (0, 6): empty.\n- LEFT: off board.\n- RIGHT (1, 7): occupied by my body.\n\nSo actually, DOWN (0, 6) would be safe next turn. I miscounted\u2014DOWN is viable after eating.\n\n**Revised evaluation:**\n- **DOWN (0, 7)**: Eats apple, then next turn only DOWN (0, 6) is safe. While only one move is available, it keeps me alive and I grow to length 5.\n- **UP (0, 9)**: Doesn't eat apple, next turn only RIGHT (1, 9) is safe. Less desirable since I'm not gaining an apple.\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Enemy #1 is far away at (4, 2), moving toward apples at (4, 3) or (4, 5). Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the best move\u2014it collects the apple and keeps me alive. After eating, I'll need to plan an escape from the left edge, but that's manageable.\n\n**Short-term plan:** After eating (0, 7), move DOWN to (0, 6). Then consider moving RIGHT to (1, 6) to open up more space and avoid getting trapped on the left edge. Long-term, aim for the (9, 9) or (4, 5) apples while monitoring enemy #1's movements.\n\nDOWN",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe moves.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- My immediate priority is to escape this tight area where I'm surrounded by my own body\n- Down is blocked by my body, creating a dangerous bottleneck\n- Moving UP to (4, 6) gets me away from this constraint and opens up more space to maneuver\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) also helps me escape the tight corridor\n- I should avoid moving LEFT toward the wall (3, 5) as it's more restrictive for future moves\n- The nearest apples are at (8, 6) and (7, 9) in the upper-right area\n- Moving UP positions me better to reach these apples while creating distance from my body\n- The enemy snake is far away at (1, 6), posing no immediate threat\n\nBest choice is UP to (4, 6) to escape the tight space and position toward the apples in the upper-right area.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1.

Actually, I'm deciding from current head (1,6). UP is (1,7) \u2014 that's empty. Let's verify board: row 6 col 1 is my head, row 7 col 1 is empty. So UP is safe.\n- **DOWN (1, 5)**: Empty \u2014 safe.\n- **LEFT (0, 6)**: My body segment \u2014 unsafe (it's the neck).\n- **RIGHT (2, 6)**: Empty \u2014 safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis of UP (1, 7):**\nFrom (1, 7) next turn possible moves:\n- UP (1, 8) \u2014 my body segment (unsafe)\n- DOWN (1, 6) \u2014 empty (body moved away)\n- LEFT (0, 7) \u2014 my body segment (unsafe)\n- RIGHT (2, 7) \u2014 empty\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 limited.\n\n**Analysis of DOWN (1, 5):**\nFrom (1, 5) next turn:\n- UP (1, 6) \u2014 empty (body moved away)\n- DOWN (1, 4) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT (0, 5) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT (2, 5) \u2014 empty\n\nThat gives 4 options next turn \u2014 excellent flexibility.\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT (2, 6):**\nFrom (2, 6) next turn:\n- UP (2, 7) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN (2, 5) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT (1, 6) \u2014 empty (body moved away)\n- RIGHT (3, 6) \u2014 empty\n\nAlso 4 options \u2014 good.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nClosest apple: (9, 0) is far \u2014 need to go down and right. DOWN or RIGHT both move toward it. (8, 6) is closer but enemy might go for it.

Since I'm near left edge, moving RIGHT increases space. But DOWN also gives more central access.\n\nGiven enemy has 9 apples (near win at 30), I need to survive and collect apples safely. DOWN seems slightly better because it opens path to bottom apples and keeps more options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), aim to move right/down toward (9, 0) while avoiding enemy.

UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are all safe. RIGHT moves me to (9, 6), putting me on the right edge with good access to the upper apples.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- I just grew to 10 segments, so I need to be mindful of my longer body\n- The apple cluster at (9, 9), (7, 9), (9, 1), (9, 0) is concentrated on the right side\n- Moving RIGHT positions me well to pursue (9, 9) and (7, 9) apples\n- Moving UP would also be reasonable, taking me to (8, 7) and closer to (7, 9)\n- I have a significant lead (10 vs 4 apples) so I should prioritize safe positioning over risky plays\n\nConsidering access to apples: RIGHT to (9, 6) gives me good options - I could then go UP to (9, 7) and continue toward (9, 9), or go LEFT to (8, 7) then (7, 7) toward (7, 9).

Enemy possible moves: UP off board (unsafe), DOWN (9, 8) body (unsafe), LEFT (8, 9) empty, RIGHT off board (unsafe). Enemy must go LEFT to (8, 9) to survive. This means they're moving away from the (7, 9) apple, giving me an opportunity.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is optimal - positions me at (7, 8) with the (7, 9) apple directly above me next turn, while maintaining good flexibility (3 safe moves next turn). Enemy is forced away from this apple. UP is too restrictive next turn. DOWN moves away from apples.\n\n**Short-term plan:** From (7, 8), next turn I can go UP to (7, 9) for the apple while enemy moves away. This grows me and extends my options.\n\nRIGHT",

Only LEFT is safe.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- I'm trapped in the top-right corner with my body blocking the only viable escape route\n- I have only ONE safe move: LEFT to (8, 9)\n- This is a precarious position - I've painted myself into a corner\n- After moving LEFT, I need to carefully navigate to avoid getting trapped again\n- The enemy snake is distant at (6, 8) and doesn't pose an immediate threat\n- I have a significant lead (11 vs 4 apples), so survival and maintaining safe positions is key\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. This turn: Move LEFT to (8, 9) - my only safe move\n2. Next turn: From (8, 9), I should consider DOWN to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 9) (which has an apple!) while avoiding moving back into my body\n3.

This would extend my lead\n\n**Safety check:**\n- RIGHT is immediately fatal (into my body)\n- UP is impossible (edge of board)\n- Both DOWN and LEFT are safe\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nLEFT to (7, 9) gets me an apple and extends my lead to 12 vs 4. This is highly advantageous given my comfortable lead. While it keeps me near the top edge, it positions me to potentially work my way down and avoid getting trapped.\n\nDOWN to (8, 8) is also safe but doesn't get me closer to any immediate apples.\n\n**Conflict check:**\nThe enemy snake at (7, 8) could potentially move UP to (7, 9), creating a head-on collision. However, given the enemy's position, it's more likely to move toward the center or away from edges.\n\nGiven my significant lead (11 vs 4 apples), collecting the apple at (7, 9) is strategically valuable.

This grows me to length 5 and increases my score to 5 apples. The enemy has 11 apples, so I need to catch up.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy head at (8, 9). Their possible moves:\n- UP off board (unsafe)\n- DOWN (8, 8) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT (7, 9) \u2014 apple (but my head is moving there too)\n- RIGHT off board (unsafe)\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are DOWN to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 9).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 9) and I go UP to (7, 9), we have a head-on collision and both die. That would end the game with enemy winning 11 to 5.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (8, 8), then UP is safe for me.\n\n**Risk evaluation:**\nThe enemy is unlikely to choose LEFT into a potential head-on collision when they have a safe DOWN move available, especially since they're leading 11-4. They'll probably play safe and go DOWN to (8, 8).  \nBut there's still a risk if they choose LEFT.\n\n**Alternative moves:**\n- RIGHT (8, 8): Would put me where enemy might move DOWN to. If enemy goes DOWN, we collide head-on. If enemy goes LEFT, I'm safe. Risky.\n- DOWN (7, 7): Safe but moves away from the apple.\n\n**Next-turn flexibility after each move:**\n- UP (7, 9): After eating apple, next moves: UP off board (unsafe), DOWN (7, 8) empty, LEFT (6, 9) empty, RIGHT (8, 9) enemy's current position (might be empty next turn) \u2192 2-3 safe moves.\n- DOWN (7, 7): Next moves: UP (7, 8) empty, DOWN (7, 6) empty, LEFT (6, 7) empty, RIGHT (8, 7) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.\n- RIGHT (8, 8): Risky due to potential collision.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the aggressive play for the apple. The enemy is more likely to avoid the collision and go DOWN, since they're winning. If they surprise me and go LEFT, we both die and they win, but that's a risky move for them too.  \nThe reward (growing, catching up on apples) outweighs the risk given the enemy's probable conservative play.\n\n**Short-term plan:** After eating the apple at (7, 9), I'll have more flexibility to maneuver in the top area. The enemy will be at (8, 8) if they go DOWN, giving me space to plan my next move toward other apples like (0, 9) or (9, 1).\n\nUP",
