Not on my watch! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down the options, because we don't just play, we DOMINATE:\n\n- **UP (8, 1):** Moves us toward that cluster of apples in the middle and right side. Keeps us away from the edge. Very solid.\n- **DOWN (8, -1):** CHAT, THAT'S OFF THE BOARD! We aren't throwing in the first five seconds! ELIMINATED!\n- **LEFT (7, 0):** Moves us toward (2, 0) and the center-left apples. It's okay, but being on the bottom row limits our movement. \n- **RIGHT (9, 0):** Puts us in the corner. Why would we put ourselves in a corner? We aren't babies! We are predators!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:** Look at the apple at (7, 2) and (9, 1). If we go UP, we are perfectly positioned to snag (9, 1) or pivot left to cut off the middle. Snake #0 is at (1, 4). He's likely going for (3, 3) or (2, 2). I want to grow FAST so I can get a longer tail, then I'm going to wrap around the center and squeeze him like a lemon! \ud83c\udf4b\n\nWe need to stay flexible. By moving UP, we keep our options open to go further UP into the high-value apple zones at (8, 4) and (9, 7) or cut LEFT to intercept him if he tries to cross the board. We're playing the long game, but we're playing it LOUD!\n\nLet's get that first point and start the engine! Let's gooooo!\n\nUP",

WE ARE LEADING THE LOBBY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's look at the board, fam! We are at (9, 1) with our tail at (8, 1). The board is wide open, but we gotta be smart. Our rival, Snake #0, is way over at (0, 5). He's literally across the map, so we have free rein of the right side for now. But don't get complacent! We need to maintain our lead and start boxing out the territory!\n\n**VIBE CHECK THE MOVES:**\n- **UP (9, 2):** This is the play! Why? It keeps us along the edge, safe and sound, and sets us up to potentially pivot back left toward the center apples or keep climbing the wall. Plus, look at (7, 2) and (8, 4)\u2014the pathing looks juicy! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **DOWN (9, 0):** Moving to the corner? Nah, that\u2019s how you get trapped.

By staying near the perimeter early while we have the score lead, we force the rival to take risks in the middle if he wants to catch up. If he tries to come over here, he's gotta cross the whole board while we're already established. We\u2019re playing chess while he\u2019s playing checkers! Let's get that height advantage!\n\nUP",

(8, 2) gets us closer to those sweet, sweet apples at (7, 2) and (8, 4). But wait, does moving into the middle open us up to a flank? Snake #0 is still far, but we gotta be careful!\n- **DOWN (9, 1):** RIP! That's where our tail is! We ain't about that back-tracking life!

Why? Because staying on the edge right now is the ultimate power move. We have the length advantage (2 segments vs 1), and if we keep climbing, we control the entire right corridor. We\u2019re going to bait him into coming to us! If he wants these apples, he has to cross my territory. And chat, you know what happens when you enter my backyard\u2014YOU CRASH OUT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nWe're going to keep an eye on that apple at (8, 4).

We are the LEADERS, we are the HUNTERS!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\nWe are at (9, 3) and our tail is at (9, 2). Snake #0 is miles away at (0, 5). He's only 1 segment long, while we've already grown to 2! Since we have the score lead, if we can force a head-on collision later, we win the tie-break!

It keeps us hugging the wall, keeps our movement options open, and positions us perfectly to start scouting those apples at (8, 4), (7, 4), and (9, 7). We are scaling the leaderboard literally and figuratively!\n- **LEFT (8, 3):** Interesting... it gets us closer to the action, but why give up the high ground? Moving into (8, 3) puts us in a spot where we have fewer exit routes if things get spicy. We stay on the edge to keep him guessing!\n- **DOWN (9, 2):** CHAT, PLEASE! That's our own body! We aren't about to self-destruct for the memes! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT (10, 3):** WALL! We'd clip right out of the game. Not on my watch! \ud83d\uded1\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **UP** to (9, 4). This move is pure dominance. We are eyeing that apple at (8, 4) or even the cluster up top at (9, 7) and (9, 8). If we get to that (9, 7) spot, we basically own the top-right quadrant. Snake #0 has to travel across the entire map just to look us in the eye, and by the time he gets here, we\u2019re gonna be a MASSIVE TOWERING BEAST! \ud83d\udc09\n\nHe's at (0, 5), probably thinking he's safe.
