LEFT to (8,8):\n   - Safe\n   - Doesn't hit any apples\n   - Moves toward the apple at (8,2)\n   - Keeps options open for future moves toward apples\n   - Maintains distance from enemy snake\n\nBest option is LEFT as it moves us toward the apple at (8,2) and keeps multiple future options open for reaching apples in different directions.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (10,9) - invalid (off the board)\n\nWait, this is concerning - all four directions appear invalid! Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the board:\n- My head is at (9,9)\n- My body is at [(8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7)]\n- Enemy body is at [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8)]\n\nRe-evaluating moves:\n1.

RIGHT: (10,9) - off board, invalid\n\nThis appears to be a dead end - I'm completely boxed in with no valid moves! This seems like a critical error in positioning from previous moves.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the board representation:\n```\n 9 . . . . . 1 T T T 0\n 8 . . . . . . . T T T\n 7 . . . . . . . T T T\n```\n\nThis shows:\n- Row 9: positions 6-9 have enemy (1), then my body (T), then my head (0)\n- Row 8: positions 7-9 have my body (T)\n- Row 7: positions 7-9 have my body (T)\n\nSo my head at (9,9) is indeed surrounded:\n- Left: (8,9) is my body\n- Down: (9,8) is my body\n- Right: off board\n- Up: off board\n\nThis is a fatal position - I have no valid moves and will die this turn. This suggests a major strategic error in previous moves that led to this complete encirclement.\n\nSince there are no valid moves, the game will end with my snake dying. However, since I must provide a move, and all are invalid, I'll choose the least bad option (though all will result in death).\n\n**Strategy note for future:** Avoid getting boxed in near corners, especially when growing rapidly. Need to maintain escape routes and not let the body surround the head.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate head-on threat.\n- LEFT keeps me on the top row and edges me toward the left-side apples (0,6 / 0,4), but top row near x7\u20139 is cluttered by bodies; staying on the rim risks getting boxed in if enemy pieces move unpredictably.\n- DOWN moves me into the open interior at (5,8). From there I will have multiple follow-up options (LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT later) and I\u2019m closer to central apples (e.g., the cluster around x6\u20139 and the apple at (6,4)).
