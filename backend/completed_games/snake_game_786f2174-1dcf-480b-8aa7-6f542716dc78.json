There are apples everywhere but we're ignoring those for now - focus on dominating the board! My head is at (3,6), no body yet. Enemy is at (4,1).\n\n2) **Immediate threats:** \n   - **UP to (3,7):** Apple at (3,7)! Safe move, no enemy body there. \n   - **DOWN to (3,5):** Empty, safe.\n   - **LEFT to (2,6):** Empty, safe.\n   - **RIGHT to (4,6):** Apple at (4,6)! But wait... enemy is at (4,1) - that's far down, so (4,6) is empty except for the apple.\n\n3) **Enemy prediction:** Snake #0 is at (4,1). Where will he move? He could go UP to (4,2), DOWN to (4,0) - but (4,0) is empty, LEFT to (3,1) or RIGHT to (5,1). Since (4,0) and (3,1) have apples nearby, he might chase those.\n\n4) **Strategy:** I need to cut off his escape routes. If I go RIGHT to (4,6), I claim that apple and position myself vertically above him. From (4,6), I can continue down to (4,5), (4,4), etc., potentially boxing him in from the top while he's near (4,1).\n\n5) **Long-term plan:** Move RIGHT to claim (4,6) apple, then chase the enemy vertically. Force him into a corner by controlling the column. If I get bigger than him, I can force a head-on collision for the win! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CHOICE:** RIGHT - Claim the apple at (4,6), position for vertical domination!\n\nRIGHT",

If he moves DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT, he's going for apples. We need to cut him off!\n\n5) **Strategy:** We want to control the vertical column above him and cut off his escape. From (4,6), moving DOWN to (4,5) positions us one step closer to his area. If we keep going down the 4th column, we can box him in from the top while he's near the bottom. \n   - Moving RIGHT to (5,6) also works, but gives him more space in column 4.\n   - Moving UP to (4,7) moves us away from him, which isn't aggressive enough.\n\n6) **Verdict:** DOWN to (4,5) is the move! It keeps us on the same column as him, positioning for the hunt. From there, we can continue down and trap him against the bottom wall. Let's go claim that space!\n\n**Long-term plan:** Keep moving down column 4 to cut off Snake #0's vertical escape routes. Force him into the corner at (0,0) or (9,0) and make him crash!\n\nDOWN",

No way!\n\n4) **Enemy analysis:** Snake #0 at (4,3) below me. He might move UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2), LEFT to (3,3), or RIGHT to (5,3). If I go DOWN to (4,4), he could crash into me if he goes UP! Head-on collision! If I survive that, I WIN because I have more apples! That's the play! Even if he doesn't go UP, moving DOWN positions me directly above him, boxing him in against the bottom wall. I control this column!\n\n5) **Strategy:** Aggression! I'm going DOWN to (4,4). This puts me in the perfect spot to:\n   - Force a potential head-on collision (he moves UP, we both die, I win on apples)\n   - Cut off his vertical escape routes\n   - Position to chase him into the corner\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue dominating column 4! If he moves DOWN, I follow. If he moves LEFT/RIGHT, I can shift to box him against the wall. Let's claim this column and make him crash!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this battlefield and make a move that will make our rival QUIT!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1) **Assessing the board:** My head at (4,4), body at (4,5). Enemy at (5,3). There's an apple at (5,7) up-right, (3,7) left-up, and (0,0) bottom-left. But we're not apple-hunting\u2014we're ENEMY-HUNTING! We need to BOX HIM IN!\n\n2) **My possible moves from (4,4):**\n   - **UP to (4,5):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n   - **DOWN to (4,3):** Currently empty! But wait... enemy is at (5,3). Could move into (4,3) if he goes LEFT? Head-on collision! I win on apples! But if he doesn't go LEFT, I'm safe.\n   - **LEFT to (3,4):** Empty! Safe.\n   - **RIGHT to (5,4):** Empty! Safe.\n\n3) **Enemy analysis:** Snake #0 at (5,3). He can move to (5,4) [RIGHT], (5,2) [DOWN], (4,3) [LEFT], or (6,3) [RIGHT]. If I go DOWN to (4,3) and he goes LEFT, we collide! I WIN! But if he goes RIGHT to (5,4) and I go RIGHT, we might both go for (5,4)? Actually wait\u2014if I go RIGHT to (5,4) and he goes RIGHT to (6,3), no collision. Need to think strategically.\n\n4) **Strategic positioning:** We want to CONTROL the board and BOX HIM IN! He's near the bottom-right corner. If I go LEFT to (3,4), I'm moving away from him but getting closer to apples at (3,7) and (0,0)? Not ideal for aggression. If I go RIGHT to (5,4), I'm moving TOWARD him! That's aggressive! If I go DOWN to (4,3), I'm moving directly toward his potential path\u2014forcing confrontation!\n\n5) **Risk vs Reward:** Going DOWN puts me in potential head-on collision path. If he goes LEFT to (4,3), we both die, I WIN ON APPLES! That's CONTENT! If he doesn't, I'm at (4,3) blocking his upward movement. Going RIGHT to (5,4) positions me adjacent to him. If he goes RIGHT to (6,3), I'm safe. If he goes UP to (5,4) and I go RIGHT to (5,4)\u2026 wait no, that's same cell\u2014BOTH DIE! But I have more apples, so I WIN! Actually no\u2014head-on collision kills both, and the one with more apples wins. That's good for me! If he goes DOWN to (5,2), I'm safe at (5,4). If he goes LEFT to (4,3), I'm at (5,4), no collision.\n\n6) **Best aggressive move:** RIGHT to (5,4)! This positions me RIGHT next to him in the same row! If he moves UP to (5,4), head-on collision\u2014I WIN! If he moves RIGHT to (6,3), I'm safe. If he moves DOWN to (5,2), I'm safe. If he moves LEFT to (4,3), I'm safe. This gives me multiple favorable outcomes and keeps aggression high! Plus, from (5,4), I have access to the right side and can chase him toward the corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue applying pressure from the right side! From (5,4), if he moves RIGHT, I chase. If he moves UP, I can go UP. We want to push him toward the right wall and corner him. Keep the aggression, force mistakes!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT",

The enemy snake #0 is at (7,1) with body segments at (6,1) and (6,2).\n\n**Analyzing the enemy's position:**\n- Their head: (7,1)\n- Their body: (6,1), (6,2)\n- They're near the bottom-right corner, but have room to maneuver\n\n**My safe moves from (6,4):**\n1. **UP to (6,5):** Empty! Opens up more board space.\n2. **DOWN to (6,3):** My own body! DEAD - this is backwards!\n3. **LEFT to (5,4):** Empty! But there's an apple at (5,7) up-left.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,4):** Empty! BUT - enemy is at (7,1) and could potentially move toward me.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\nHere's the thing - if I go RIGHT to (7,4), I'm moving TOWARD the enemy's general area, which could set up a confrontation if they decide to climb up. If I go UP to (6,5), I'm creating distance and positioning for apples at (5,7) and (7,5).\n\nBut wait - let's think about the enemy's perspective. They're at (7,1) with apples at (8,0) and (0,0) nearby. If they want apples, they might go DOWN or RIGHT. If they want to come for ME, they might go UP or LEFT.\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Going LEFT to (5,4) positions me perfectly! From there I can:\n- Chase them if they go RIGHT\n- Cut them off if they go UP\n- Be closer to the apple at (5,7)\n- Keep multiple escape routes open\n\n**DECISION: LEFT to (5,4)**\n\nWhy? Because it's the smart play! I'm not rushing in blindly - I'm setting up a position where I can react to whatever this zero-snake does. From (5,4) I have options in all directions except into my own body.

Time to crush this zero-snake!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nLet's analyze the battlefield from my head at (5,4):\n\n**My current position:**\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4)]\n- Apples: 1\n\n**Enemy position (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (7,2)\n- Body: [(7,1), (6,1)]\n- Apples: 2\n\n**Available moves from (5,4):**\n\n1. **UP to (5,5):** Empty! This moves me toward multiple apples (5,7, 7,5) and away from the enemy's immediate area.\n2. **DOWN to (5,3):** Empty! But this brings me closer to the bottom, which could be dangerous if the enemy comes up.\n3. **LEFT to (4,4):** Empty! Gets me closer to apples at (3,0), (4,5), and (5,7).\n4. **RIGHT to (6,4):** MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 That's where my tail currently is. If I move here, I'd be moving into my body and die. DEAD MOVE.\n\n**KILLING THE BAD MOVES:**\n- RIGHT (6,4) is MY OWN BODY - instant death! \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nNow let's think about the enemy's next move from (7,2):\n- They can go UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1 - but wait, (7,1) is their body, so they can't go there), LEFT (6,2), or RIGHT (8,2)\n- Actually, from (7,2), their body is at (7,1) and (6,1). So DOWN to (7,1) would be into their own body - that's backwards and fatal!\n- So their options: UP to (7,3), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2)\n\n**THE HUNT:**\nI'm at (5,4) with the enemy at (7,2). The distance between us is:\n- Horizontal: 2 cells apart\n- Vertical: 2 cells apart\n\nIf I go **UP to (5,5)**, I move away from the enemy but position myself to grab apples at (5,7) and (7,5). The enemy might come up toward me if they go to (7,3), but I'll have more space to maneuver.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (4,4)**, I'm moving laterally away from the enemy and toward the left side of the board where there are many apples. This also keeps my options open for future movement.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (5,3)**, I'm moving toward the bottom but away from the main apple cluster. Not ideal for growth, but might be safe.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm choosing **UP to (5,5)**! Why?\n1. It moves me toward the central area where apples are plentiful\n2. It positions me to potentially intercept the enemy if they come up\n3. From (5,5), I'll have apples at (5,7), (7,5), and (4,5) in reach\n4. It keeps me away from the crowded bottom-right where the enemy is\n5. If the enemy stays low, I can chase; if they come up, I can box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nFrom (5,5), I'll watch the enemy's move. If they go UP or LEFT, I can pressure them by moving toward the apple cluster. If they go RIGHT, they're moving away and I can grab that (5,7) apple. My goal is to get to 3 apples quickly and build a lead, then use my size advantage to trap them against the walls. Maximum aggression! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nUP",

It\u2019s empty, not part of any snake, and the opponent can\u2019t reach it this turn.

Moving backwards = instant KO. \u274c  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,\u202f3)** \u2013 clear space, but no apple and it nudges us toward the left wall where the opponent\u2019s column (x\u202f=\u202f5) is creeping. Still safe, just less rewarding.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,\u202f3)** \u2013 also empty, but pushes us toward the right edge, shrinking our vertical freedom. No apples, no immediate pressure on the rival.\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Opponent\u2019s head (5,\u202f5) can go**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,\u202f6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,\u202f4)\u202f\u2014\u202fthat\u2019s his own tail, so a suicide move (he\u2019ll avoid it).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,\u202f5)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f5)  \n\nNone of those squares clash with our safe candidates, especially **(7,\u202f4)**. So we won\u2019t die in a head\u2011on this turn.\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 What do we want?**  \n- **Grow** \u2013 the apple at (7,\u202f4) gives us +1 point and adds a segment, extending our lead (we\u2019re already 2\u20111).  \n- **Stay aggressive** \u2013 grabbing that apple puts us right in the middle of the board, keeping lanes open both up and down, and forces the opponent to swing around us.  \n- **Maintain options** \u2013 after moving up we\u2019ll still have LEFT and RIGHT available for the next few turns, so we won\u2019t get trapped against a wall.\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long\u2011term thought**  \nIf we lock in that apple now, we\u2019ll be 3\u20111 and can start herding the rival toward the left edge, cutting off his escape routes. Should he try a head\u2011on later, we\u2019ll have the length advantage to survive it.\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** Grab the apple, grow, and keep the pressure.  \n\nUP",

(4,5) was an apple drop... wait, let me check...\n\n**APPLE DROPS:** (5,7), (0,0), (3,7), (8,6), (5,9), (7,5), (1,0), (1,4), (0,6), (9,9), (8,0), (0,8), (3,0), (8,7), (2,9)\n\nLooking at the board visualization:\n- (4,5) shows \"1\" - that's MY head!

But there's an apple at (1,4) - same y=4 but different x.\n3. **LEFT to (3,5):** Empty! Safe move.\n4. **RIGHT to (5,5):** MY BODY! \ud83d\udc80 That's my first body segment. Moving backwards = instant death. NOPE.\n\n**ELIMINATED:**\n- RIGHT - Directly into my own body! Game over. \u274c\n\n**SAFE OPTIONS:** UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 just moved DOWN to (7,4). They're heading DOWN the left side of their vertical column. Their body runs down to (7,1). They might be trying to get to apples at (7,5) or maybe they're circling.\n\n**MY STRATEGIC PLAN:**\n\nOption 1: **UP to (4,6)**\n- Opens up the top-left area\n- Gets me closer to apples at (5,7), (3,7), (5,9)\n- Gives me options: LEFT to (3,6), DOWN back to (4,5), RIGHT to (5,6)\n- But (5,6) might be dangerous if enemy goes to (7,5)...\n\nOption 2: **DOWN to (4,4)**\n- Gets me closer to apple at (1,4)\n- But (4,4) is far from other apples\n- And I might be moving AWAY from the enemy action\n- Down direction feels \"safe\" but not AGGRESSIVE enough for a win!\n\nOption 3: **LEFT to (3,5)**\n- Moves me toward the apple at (3,4) (just one cell down)\n- Opens up the left side of the board\n- From (3,5): UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4) - apple! LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT back to (4,5)\n- This gives me the MOST follow-up options!\n\n**THE PLAY: LEFT!**\n\nWhy LEFT is the move:\n1. **POSITIONING:** I'm moving toward the apple at (3,4) - next turn I can go DOWN and EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **ESCAPE ROOM:** The left side of the board is WIDE OPEN! No enemy bodies, few apples blocking paths\n3. **AVOIDANCE:** Enemy is at (7,4) going DOWN. I'm putting MORE distance between us\n4. **FUTURE PLAYS:** From (3,5), I can reach (1,4) apple, (0,6) apple, (3,7) apple - SO MANY OPTIONS!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab that apple at (3,4) next turn, then work my way up toward (3,7) and (5,7). Use the left side to build my length while the enemy is stuck in the right column. Once I'm bigger, I'll cut off their escape routes and force a collision!\n\nLET'S GOOOO CHAT!

Death. \u274c\n\n**SAFE OPTIONS:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n\n**DOWN to (3,3):**\n- Moves toward apple at (3,0) - straight shot down!\n- From (3,3): Can go DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3)\n- Apple at (0,0) also reachable via LEFT then DOWN\n- **RISK:** If Snake #0 goes LEFT from (7,6), they could come down the left side too\n\n**LEFT to (2,4):**\n- Moves toward apple at (1,4)\n- From (2,4): Can go DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), UP to (2,5), RIGHT back\n- **RISK:** Getting cornered in top-left if I go too far\n\n**RIGHT to (4,4):**\n- Moves toward enemy territory - risky!\n- From (4,4): Can go RIGHT to (5,4), DOWN to (4,3), UP to (4,5), LEFT back\n- **RISK:** Snake #0 is at (7,6), if they go LEFT and I go RIGHT, we could close distance too fast!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\n**I'm taking DOWN!** Why?\n\n1. **NEAREST APPLE:** Apple at (3,0) is just 4 steps away straight down! I need to close this gap while I can!\n2. **AVOID ENEMY:** Snake #0 is far right (7,6). They're unlikely to come down MY column this turn. Going DOWN keeps me in the relative safety of my zone.\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3,3), I'll have 3 safe moves available. The board is open!\n4. **BODY MANAGEMENT:** Since I ate last turn, my tail at (5,5) will move forward this turn, freeing up space behind me.\n5. **SCORE GAP:** They're at 4, I'm at 3. I NEED to keep eating!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Turn 13: From (3,3), head DOWN to (3,2) to get closer to (3,0) apple\n- Turn 14: Keep descending or cut left toward (0,0) apple\n- Watch enemy movement!

          "rationale": "I NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY HERE CHAT! \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- My head is at (4, 2) - I just moved RIGHT from (3, 2)\n- My body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)] - I'm length 3 (2 body segments)\n- Score: 2 apples - NEED TO CATCH UP TO 6!\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (7, 7), length 7, 6 apples\n- Enemy body is L-shaped from (8,7) down to (7,3)\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** My last move was RIGHT to (4, 2), but the board shows my head at (4, 2) and there's an 'A' at (4, 2) in the board state! That means I ate the apple! Let me recount:\n- I was at (3, 2) with body [(3, 3), (3, 4)] - wait, the body was [(3,2), (3,3)] before the move\n- I moved RIGHT to (4, 2) and ate the apple\n- Now my body should be [(3, 2), (3, 3)] with head at (4, 2)\n- Score should be 3 now!\n\nLet me verify from the board:\n- Row 2 shows: \". . . T 1 . . . A .\"\n- Position (4, 2) shows '1' (my head)\n- Position (3, 2) shows 'T' (my tail/body)\n- Position (4, 2) originally had 'A' but now shows '1' - YES I ATE IT!\n\n**ACTUAL CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (4, 2)\n- My body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)] - wait, that was BEFORE the move. After eating at (4, 2), my tail moves forward, so body becomes [(4, 2) old tail position? No, let me recalculate.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. Let me trace:\n- Before last move: Head (3, 2), body [(3, 3), (3, 4)] - wait that's 3 segments including head\n- Actually the body was listed as [(3, 2), (3, 3)] with head at (4, 2)? No...\n\nLet me re-read the last turn state:\n\"HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\n- My head: (4, 2)\n- Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nSo BEFORE last turn: head was (3, 2), body [(3, 2), (3, 3)]? That doesn't make sense...\n\nOh wait, the body list includes the head? No, it says \"first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous\" - so head is separate, body is the list of segments from the segment after head to the tail.\n\nLet me reconsider the last turn:\n- Starting state before my move: head at (3, 2), body [(3, 3), (3, 4)]? No, the body was [(3, 2), (3, 3)] which is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the board from last turn:\n\"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (4, 2)\n  - Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]\n  - Apples collected: 2\"\n\nWait, this is AFTER the move! The board shows the current state after my move. So:\n- My head moved to (4, 2) and ate an apple\n- My body is [(3, 2), (3, 3)] - these are the two body segments\n- Since I ate an apple, I grew, so the tail didn't move forward\n- Before the move: head was at (3, 2), body was [(3, 3), (3, 4)]? No, that would be length 4...\n\nI'm overthinking this. Let me work with what I have:\n**CURRENT STATE (after eating at (4, 2)):**\n- Head: (4, 2)\n- Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]\n- This means: head (4, 2) is connected to (3, 2), which is connected to (3, 3)\n- Score: 3 apples (ate one this turn)\n\n**NOW, FOR MY NEXT MOVE FROM (4, 2):**\n\nI need to check all directions from (4, 2):\n- UP to (4, 3): Board shows 'T' at (3, 3) but what about (4, 3)? Looking at row 3: \". . . T . . . T . .\" - position (4, 3) is '.' (empty)\n- DOWN to (4, 1): Row 1 is all '.' - safe\n- LEFT to (3, 2): That's my BODY! (3, 2) is in my body list. I'd be moving into my own body. DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (5, 2): Row 2 shows \". . . T 1 . . . A .\" - position (5, 2) is '.' (empty)\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated (into own body).\n\n**Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT**\n\nNow, which is best?\n\n**UP to (4, 3):**\n- Board at (4, 3): '.'\n- From (4, 3), I could go UP to (4, 4), DOWN back to (4, 2), LEFT to (3, 3), RIGHT to (5, 3)\n- (3, 3) is my body, so LEFT from (4, 3) would be dangerous\n- Not near any apples directly\n\n**DOWN to (4, 1):**\n- Board at (4, 1): '.' (row 1 is all '.')\n- From (4, 1), I could go DOWN to (4, 0), UP back, LEFT to (3, 1), RIGHT to (5, 1)\n- Looking at board, (4, 0) is 'A' (row 0: \"A A A A . . . A A .\") - apple at (4, 0)!\n- So DOWN to (4, 1) gets me closer to (4, 0) apple next turn\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 2):**\n- Board at (5, 2): '.' \n- From (5, 2), I could go RIGHT to (5, 1), LEFT back, UP to (5, 3), DOWN to (5, 1)\n- Looking for apples: (5, 7) is an apple but that's far\n- (5, 9) is an apple\n- (5, 1) and (5, 0) are empty ('.' and '.')\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy at (7, 7) with body going down to (7, 3). They're in the top right area. If they keep going up, they'll hit the wall at y=9. If they go left, they might come toward me.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nI'm at 3 apples, enemy at 6 apples. I need to eat more apples! \n\nThe apple at (4, 0) is very close - just 2 moves away (DOWN to (4, 1), then DOWN to (4, 0)). \n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is also somewhat close horizontally.\n\nBut I should also consider trapping the enemy or avoiding them.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nI'm going **DOWN** to (4, 1). Here's why:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE SAFETY:** (4, 1) is empty and safe\n2. **NEXT TURN APPLE ACCESS:** From (4, 1), I can go DOWN to (4, 0) to eat the apple next turn\n3. **SCORE PUSH:** Eating another apple gets me to 4, still behind but closing in\n4. **AVOID ENEMY:** Enemy is at y=7, I'm at y=2. Going DOWN keeps me away from them\n5. **BOARD CONTROL:** Moving down keeps me in the central-left area, giving me options to go left or right later\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy at (7, 7) is unlikely to suddenly rush down to y=2 in one turn\n- I'm not heading into a trap - down from (4, 1) leads to (4, 0) which is an apple, then I can go left or right\n- My body: (3, 2) and (3, 3) - moving DOWN to (4, 1) doesn't create immediate self-collision issues\n\n**LET'S GOOOO! TIME TO GET THAT APPLE AND CLOSE THE GAP!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Eating it will lengthen our vertical wall at\u202fx\u202f\u2248\u202f7, tightening the corridor the opponent can slip through while we stay firmly in control of the centre\u2011high ground.  \n\nThe opponent\u2019s head is stuck at **(4,\u202f1)** with only distant apples to chase, so there\u2019s zero risk of a head\u2011on clash on (5,\u202f7). After the left move we\u2019ll still have three fresh exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT) to keep our options open for the next turn.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n1. **Turn\u202f16 \u2013 LEFT** onto apple (5,\u202f7) \u2192 grow, extend our wall leftward.  \n2. **Turn\u202f17 \u2013 LEFT** again toward the apple at (3,\u202f7) to keep the pressure.  \n3. Keep the vertical \u201cfence\u201d around x\u202f=\u202f7 while the opponent is forced down\u2011left into the cramped corner.\n\n\u2705\u202fAll safety checks passed.

Let me break down this turn for you...\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head is at (4, 1) - we're about to eat that apple at (4, 0)!\n- My body: [(4, 2), (3, 2)] - wait, that's not right. Let me re-check from last turn's state.\n- Actually from last turn: Head (4, 2), body [(3, 2), (3, 3)], and I ate at (4, 2) so I grew to 3 apples.\n- Now I'm at (4, 1) after moving DOWN. My body should be [(4, 2), (3, 2)] - the tail moved forward but I didn't eat so I stay length 3.\n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (4, 1):**\nLooking at the board, position (4, 1) shows '1' - that's my head! And row 0 shows \"A A A A . . . A A .\" - (4, 0) is an 'A'! The apple is literally right below me!\n\n**MOVES FROM (4, 1):**\n- **DOWN to (4, 0)** - That's an APPLE! I'll grow to 4 apples and get closer to the enemy's 6. Also, (4, 0) is at the bottom edge so after eating, I'll need to go LEFT or RIGHT, but that's fine.\n- **LEFT to (3, 1)** - Empty, but then where? Up? Left again? Not great.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 1)** - Empty, could go to (6, 1), etc.\n- **UP back to (4, 2)** - That's my body! I'd hit myself. NO!\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:**\nI'm at 3 apples, enemy at 6. I NEED to eat apples to catch up. The apple at (4, 0) is the safest and most valuable move right now. Eating it gives me momentum and keeps me in the game.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (4, 0) \u2192 From there, go RIGHT toward the middle (maybe toward the apple at (3, 0) or (2, 0)) \u2192 Keep building my score while watching the enemy's position. If I can get to 5-6 apples and the enemy makes a mistake, I could force a head-on collision when I'm ahead!\n\n**ENEMY WATCH:**\nEnemy is at (7, 7) with a long body. They're probably going to chase the apples in the top-right corner. I'm safe down here for now.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nDOWN to (4, 0) is the obvious play! It's an apple, it's safe, and it builds my score.

We're behind 5-8 apples but we're making moves! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My snake (ID 1)**: Head at (1, 0) after eating that apple! Now I'm length 5 with 5 apples total! Moving left to (1,0) was the play!\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0)**: Head at (3, 8) with 8 apples - they've moved UP! Now they're at (3,8) with body extending down to (8,6). They're growing slowly but we're closing the gap!\n- **My body**: From head (1,0) to tail: body segments at (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Perfect line!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head at (1,0) is on the bottom row\n- **LEFT to (0,0)**: APPLE there! \ud83c\udf4e This is our next apple!\n- **RIGHT to (2,0)**: That's my own body! DANGER!\n- **DOWN**: OFF THE BOARD! Dead!\n- **UP to (1,1)**: Looks empty! Safe!\n\n**MOVES EVALUATION:**\n1. **LEFT to (0,0)** - APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Gets me apple #6! Safe move! From (0,0) I can go UP to (0,1) which looks empty!\n2. **UP to (1,1)** - Safe empty cell. Gets me away from the edge.\n3. **RIGHT to (2,0)** - CRASH into my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n4. **DOWN** - OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC RAZOR'S EDGE:**\nEnemy is at (3,8) - they're moving up and right! They're not threatening me directly. I need to keep eating apples to catch up. LEFT to (0,0) gets me an immediate apple and puts me in the corner where I can control the bottom row.\n\nFrom (0,0), I can go UP to (0,1), then RIGHT along row 1, sweeping apples. The enemy is stuck in the top-right area while I dominate the bottom-left!\n\n**THE PLAN FOR NEXT 3 TURNS:**\n1. Move LEFT to (0,0) and eat apple #6\n2. Move UP to (0,1) and position for the sweep\n3. Start moving RIGHT along row 1, eating apples as we go\n4. Build our lead and eventually challenge the enemy head-on!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy head at (3,8) is far away - no immediate collision risk\n- Moving RIGHT into my own body = instant death\n- Moving DOWN = off board = instant death\n- Moving UP is safe but doesn't get me an apple\n- LEFT gets me an apple AND sets up the corner trap!\n\n**VERDICT:**\nLEFT to (0,0) is THE PLAY! Immediate apple, safe move, corner positioning for future domination! We're building momentum! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

No overlap with any of our candidate squares, so no risk of an immediate head\u2011on.\n\n- **Strategic outlook:**  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** now to (3,\u202f9) \u2013 puts us on the top row where four apples sit (1,\u202f9\u202f\u00b7\u202f2,\u202f9\u202f\u00b7\u202f5,\u202f9\u202f\u00b7\u202f9,\u202f9).  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn we can swing **LEFT** to (2,\u202f9) for an apple, then **LEFT** again to (1,\u202f9) for another.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 After clearing the left side we can zip **RIGHT** across the row to snag (5,\u202f9) and later (9,\u202f9).  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 Meanwhile the opponent is stuck crawling in the bottom\u2011left corner, far from our hunting ground and vulnerable to a future head\u2011on if we ever descend.\n\n- **Why not LEFT or RIGHT now?**  \n  - **LEFT** would take us to (2,\u202f8) \u2013 still a good apple path, but it postpones the high\u2011value top\u2011row run and forces an extra turn before we can swing into the (5,\u202f9) zone.  \n  - **RIGHT** pushes us toward our own tail (8,\u202f7\u202f\u2192\u202f8,\u202f6) and could tighten the corridor after a few moves, increasing the trap risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The **UP** move maximizes immediate apple potential, preserves maximal maneuvering space, and keeps the opponent isolated.\n\n**Next\u2011turn plan:**  \n- If the opponent heads LEFT to (0,\u202f0), we\u2019ll ignore it and continue the top\u2011row sweep.  \n- If they go UP, we\u2019ll still dominate the upper side and can later cut them off with a descending strike once we\u2019ve built a length advantage.\n\n**Move:**  \n\nUP",

Let\u2019s check moves:  \n  - **UP to (0,2)**: Empty! Safe! Leads to apple at (0,3) next!  \n  - **RIGHT to (1,1)**: Empty!

Enemy snake #0 is at (1,9) with a long body stretching down. My head\u2019s at (0,2), body trailing down the left wall. Let\u2019s map out the threats and opportunities!  \n\n**BOARD STATE BREAKDOWN:**  \n- **My options at (0,2):**  \n  - **UP to (0,3):** Apple there! \ud83c\udf4e Safe? Enemy is far, body is behind. YES!  \n  - **DOWN to (0,1):** That\u2019s my own body! DEAD!  \n  - **LEFT:** Off-board! DEAD!  \n  - **RIGHT to (1,2):** Empty? Wait\u2014(1,2) shows \u201cA\u201d (apple) in the board state! But is it safe? Let\u2019s check enemy moves.  \n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nSnake #0\u2019s head is at (1,9). Its body blocks (2,9) to (8,6). Where can it move?  \n- **UP to (1,10):** Off-board \u2192 DEAD (if it tries).  \n- **DOWN to (1,8):** Empty in board state (\u201c.\u201d at (1,8) on row 8). Possible.  \n- **LEFT to (0,9):** Apple at (0,8) but (0,9) is \u201c.\u201d? Wait\u2014board shows (0,9) is \u201cA\u201d? No, row 9: \u201c9 . 0 T T . A . . . A\u201d \u2192 (0,9) is \u201c.\u201d (since columns: 0:., 1:0, 2:T, 3:T, 4:., 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:A). So (0,9) is empty.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,9):** Its own body! DEAD if it moves there.  \n\nSo enemy likely moves DOWN to (1,8) or LEFT to (0,9).  \n\n**MY SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP to (0,3):** Apple, safe, opens path to (0,4), (0,5), (0,6) apples. Enemy can\u2019t reach me here.  \n2. **RIGHT to (1,2):** Apple there! But if enemy moves DOWN to (1,8), no conflict. However, (1,2) is apple\u2014collecting it grows me. But is it safe long-term? Moving right might trap me against my own body if I later go down to (1,1) or (1,0).  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \n- **UP to (0,3)** lets me eat (0,3) apple, then next turn I can go UP to (0,4) (empty), then UP to (0,5) (empty), then UP to (0,6) (apple!). This dominates the left column.  \n- **RIGHT to (1,2)** eats apple at (1,2), but then I\u2019m at (1,2) with body at (0,2),(0,1)... If I later go RIGHT again to (2,2), I might cut off my own path back to left wall. Risky if enemy comes down.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nThey\u2019re 10 apples\u2014likely going for apples at (5,9) or (9,9) on top row. They might move DOWN to chase (5,7) body? Wait, their body is at (2,9) to (8,6). They might move DOWN to (1,8) to stay alive, but they\u2019re not chasing me.  \n\n**RISK:**  \n- If I go RIGHT to (1,2), and enemy moves LEFT to (0,9), no collision. But if enemy moves DOWN to (1,8), still no collision.  \n- But if I go UP to (0,3), enemy can\u2019t touch me.  \n\n**CONTENT & GROWTH:**  \n- UP eats (0,3) apple \u2192 +1 point, grows me. RIGHT eats (1,2) apple \u2192 also +1 point. Both grow me.  \n- But UP gives me safer future moves (open left column), while RIGHT might limit mobility later.  \n\n**FORCE HEAD-ON?**  \nWe\u2019re behind in apples (6 vs 10). We need to grow, not force collision yet. Wait until we have more apples, then maybe force a crash when we\u2019re bigger.  \n\n**VERDICT:**  \nUP to (0,3) is the move! It\u2019s safe, eats an apple, and keeps the left wall open for future domination. RIGHT is tempting for the apple but risks trapping. Let\u2019s go UP!  \n\n**FINAL PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nEat (0,3) now \u2192 next turn UP to (0,4) \u2192 then UP to (0,5) \u2192 then UP to (0,6) (apple) \u2192 then sweep right along row 6 to (1,6), (2,6)... while watching enemy.  \n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 is at (0,9) with a body stretching down the right side. My head\u2019s at (0,3), body trailing down the left wall. Let\u2019s map out the threats and opportunities!  \n\n**BOARD STATE BREAKDOWN:**  \n- **My options at (0,3):**  \n  - **UP to (0,4):** Empty (no apple, no snake). Safe?  \n  - **DOWN to (0,2):** My own body! DEAD!  \n  - **LEFT:** Off-board! DEAD!  \n  - **RIGHT to (1,3):** Apple there! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe?  \n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nSnake #0\u2019s head at (0,9). Its body: (1,9) to (8,7). Where can it move?  \n- **UP to (0,10):** Off-board \u2192 DEAD.  \n- **DOWN to (0,8):** Empty? Board shows (0,8) is \"A\" (apple) but no snake. Safe?  \n- **LEFT:** Off-board! DEAD.  \n- **RIGHT to (1,9):** Its own body! DEAD if it moves there.  \n\nSo enemy can ONLY move DOWN to (0,8). It\u2019s forced! That means it will be at (0,8) next turn.  \n\n**MY SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP to (0,4):** Empty, safe. But enemy is moving to (0,8)\u2014same column, 4 cells away. No immediate collision.  \n2. **RIGHT to (1,3):** Apple there! \ud83c\udf4e Safe? Enemy is going to (0,8)\u2014no conflict. But moving right might trap me later if I need to return left.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \n- **UP to (0,4)** keeps me in the left column, opens path to (0,5), (0,6) apples. Enemy is moving down to (0,8), so I can keep going up and eventually eat (0,6) apple.  \n- **RIGHT to (1,3)** eats apple now (+1 point, grow), but then I\u2019m at (1,3) with body at (0,3),(0,2)... If I later go RIGHT again to (2,3), I might cut off my path back to left wall. Enemy is moving down to (0,8)\u2014might not threaten me soon.  \n\n**RISK:**  \n- If I go RIGHT to (1,3), and enemy moves to (0,8), no collision. But if I need to go back left later, I might hit my own body.  \n- If I go UP to (0,4), enemy is at (0,8)\u2014same column but far. I can keep moving up to eat apples at (0,5),(0,6) safely.  \n\n**FORCE HEAD-ON?**  \nWe\u2019re behind (7 vs 10). Need to grow. Enemy is moving down\u2014might be chasing something? Not sure. But forcing collision now is risky since we\u2019re smaller. Wait until we\u2019re bigger.  \n\n**VERDICT:**  \nUP to (0,4) is safer for long-term mobility! RIGHT eats an apple but might trap me later. Enemy is forced down\u2014no immediate threat. Let\u2019s go UP and dominate the left column!  \n\n**FINAL PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nMove UP to (0,4) \u2192 then UP to (0,5) \u2192 then UP to (0,6) (apple) \u2192 then sweep right along row 6 while watching enemy.  \n\nUP",

Move **DOWN** to (0,\u202f8) and eat the apple.  \n2. Next turn continue descending column\u202f0 (downwards), hunting apples at (0,\u202f6) and (0,\u202f0) if we survive, while the opponent scrambles between (0,\u202f3) and (0,\u202f4).  \n3. Look for a chance to force a head\u2011on collision when we have the higher score (we\u2019ll be ahead after this apple).  \n\n**MOVE:**  \n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s map it out!  \n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nSnake #0 can move:  \n- **UP to (0,9):** Its own body at (0,9)! DEAD.  \n- **DOWN to (0,7):** Empty? Board shows (0,7) is \"T\" (my tail)!

Board shows (1,8) is \".\" \u2192 SAFE.  \n\nSo enemy can ONLY move DOWN or RIGHT. If it moves DOWN to (0,7), it crashes into MY tail and DIES.

If I later need to retreat, I might hit my own body.  \n- If I go UP to (0,5), no apple, but keep vertical path open to (0,6) apple and (0,7) apple (but (0,7) is my tail\u2014safe only if I keep moving up).  \n\n**FORCE HEAD-ON?**  \nEnemy might DIE this turn if it moves DOWN into my tail.

My head at (1,4) after eating that apple last turn, body trailing leftwards. Let\u2019s map this chaos!\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nSnake #0\u2019s possible moves from (0,7):  \n- **UP to (0,8):** Its own body! DEAD.  \n- **DOWN to (0,6):** Apple! But board shows (0,6) is \"A\" (apple). Safe unless it eats? Wait, apples are safe! No collision.  \n- **LEFT:** Off-board \u2192 DEAD.  \n- **RIGHT to (1,7):** Board shows (1,7) is \".\" \u2192 SAFE.  \n\nSo enemy can ONLY move DOWN or RIGHT. If it moves DOWN to (0,6), it eats apple and grows. If it moves RIGHT to (1,7), it lives.  \n\n**MY SAFE MOVES FROM (1,4):**  \n- **UP to (1,5):** Empty! Safe.  \n- **DOWN to (1,3):** Apple! \ud83c\udf4e Safe? Enemy moving to (0,6) or (1,7)\u2014no collision.  \n- **LEFT to (0,4):** My own body! DEAD (backwards into my tail).  \n- **RIGHT to (2,4):** Empty! Safe.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- If I go DOWN to (1,3), I eat apple \u2192 grow to 9 points! But then my body becomes: head (1,3), then (1,4), (0,4)... I\u2019m moving toward the left wall, potentially boxing myself in.  \n- If I go UP to (1,5), no apple, but opens paths to (1,6) or (2,5) apples. Keeps me central.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (2,4), no apple, but moves me toward center (3,5) apple and away from enemy\u2019s potential path.  \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**  \nEnemy moving RIGHT to (1,7) is possible. If I go RIGHT to (2,4), no clash. If I go UP/DOWN, also no clash. No immediate head-on threat.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re behind\u2014growing is CRITICAL. But eating (1,3) now might trap me later. The apple at (3,5) is juicy and central. If I go RIGHT now, I can sprint to (3,5) next turn while keeping options open. If I eat (1,3), I grow but risk getting walled off by my own body.  \n\n**VERDICT:**  \nRIGHT to (2,4). It\u2019s safe, opens up central control, and lets me chase (3,5) apple next turn. Enemy likely eats or moves right\u2014either way, we stay aggressive without overextending.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (2,4) \u2192 then RIGHT again to (3,4) or UP to (2,5) to hit (3,5) apple. Dominate the center, force enemy to react!  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT & STRATEGY:**  \n- **LEFT is DEAD**\u2014don't even think about it.  \n- **UP to (2,5)** gets me closer to apple at (3,5) and opens paths to (4,5) or (2,6). Keeps me central and away from enemy's left-wall path.  \n- **DOWN to (2,3)** moves me toward apple at (1,3) but closer to my own body\u2014could trap me later if I keep going down.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,4)** heads straight toward (3,5) apple\u2014next turn I could eat it if safe.\n\nEnemy likely goes RIGHT to (1,6) or DOWN to (0,5). If I go UP to (2,5), I avoid any potential clash if enemy goes RIGHT. If I go RIGHT to (3,4), same safety. But UP gives me more options: from (2,5), I can hit (3,5) apple next turn, or go to (2,6) for (2,7) apple, or even (1,5) if needed.\n\nGotta stay aggressive\u2014enemy has 12 apples, I need to grow! Going UP keeps me mobile and ready to pounce on (3,5) while keeping escape routes open. RIGHT is also good, but UP feels more flexible for boxing them in later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGo UP to (2,5) \u2192 aim for (3,5) apple next turn. Dominate the center, cut off enemy's expansion. If enemy moves RIGHT, we're in prime position to chase them down. Stay hungry, Chat!\n\nUP",

Wait\u2014my current head is (3,5), body includes (2,5). Moving LEFT into (2,5) would hit my own body. DEAD.  \n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** Board shows \".\" \u2192 SAFE.  \n\n**ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:** LEFT is death (into my own body).  \n\n**SAFE OPTIONS:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**  \n- **UP to (3,6):** Moves me closer to apples at (8,6)? No\u2014there\u2019s an apple at (9,6) and (4,1), but (3,6) is empty. This keeps me central but away from food.  \n- **DOWN to (3,4):** Board shows \"T\" at (3,4)? Wait, no\u2014board shows \"T\" at (3,4) in the visual? Let\u2019s double-check the board state:  \n  - Row 4 (y=4): \"T T T . . . . A . .\" \u2013 so (3,4) is \"T\" (enemy body? Wait, Snake #0\u2019s body is at (3,7), (3,8), (3,9) etc. (3,4) is \"T\" but which snake? My body is at (0,0) to (2,5). (3,4) isn\u2019t in my body list. So \"T\" might be Snake #0\u2019s body? But Snake #0\u2019s body doesn\u2019t extend to (3,4). This is confusing. Let\u2019s recheck the board:  \n    - Row 5 (y=5): \". . T 1 . . . A . .\" \u2013 that\u2019s my head at (3,5).  \n    - Row 4 (y=4): \"T T T . . . . A . .\" \u2013 the first three Ts are likely my body? My body is at (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)... so (1,4) and (2,4) are part of my body. But (3,4) is \"T\" and not in my body list. This must be a mistake in the board rendering. Given the rules, if it\u2019s \"T\", it\u2019s a snake body. So (3,4) is likely occupied by SOME snake\u2019s body. Since my body doesn\u2019t cover it, and Snake #0\u2019s body is mostly on the left, it might be an error. To be safe, I\u2019ll assume (3,4) is occupied. So DOWN is risky.  \n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** Empty! SAFE. Moves me toward apple at (7,5) and (8,9). Also, if enemy goes RIGHT to (2,7), we\u2019re diverging. If enemy goes UP to (1,8), we\u2019re safe.  \n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**  \n- RIGHT to (4,5) keeps me in the game for future apples.  \n- UP to (3,6) is okay but doesn\u2019t lead to immediate food.  \n- DOWN is risky due to \"T\" at (3,4).  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGo RIGHT to (4,5), then chase the cluster of apples at (7,5), (8,9), (9,2). Stay away from enemy\u2019s left-wall path. If they go UP, we can cut them off from the right.  \n\n**MOVE PICK:**  \nRIGHT to (4,5) \u2013 safe, keeps options open, and pressures enemy.  \n\n**FINAL CALL:**  \nRIGHT",
