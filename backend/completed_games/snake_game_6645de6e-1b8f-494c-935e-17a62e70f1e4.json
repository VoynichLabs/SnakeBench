Moving LEFT is possible, although not directly toward an apple. Let's examine the board and possible future moves.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I'd be at (7, 9).

Snake 1 is at (6, 0).\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   **DOWN:** Moves me to (7, 9). This is safe and puts me closer to the (2,8) apple.\n*   **UP:** Moves me to (7, 7). Not a good direction to head.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves me to (6, 8). Could be a good option, depending on what Snake 1 does.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves me to (8, 8). No obvious benefit. Snake 1 is currently far away so I don't think I need to worry about it blocking my path.\n\nThe most immediate goal is to get to the apple at (2, 8). Moving DOWN seems like the best way to move in that general direction. I'll prioritize getting that apple first as it's closest compared to the rest.\n\nDOWN",
