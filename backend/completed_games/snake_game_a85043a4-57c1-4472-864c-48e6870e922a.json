The closest apple is at (4, 5), which is 3 steps to the right.\n3. The enemy snake is currently at (0, 5), which is below me and not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy:\n1. For now, I should focus on reaching the nearest apple at (4, 5) to grow and gain a point.\n2. After that, I can consider moving towards the apple at (5, 5) or (4, 7), depending on the enemy snake's movement.\n3. I should try to avoid getting trapped by the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nNext turn reminder: After moving right, re-evaluate the positions of the apples and the enemy snake to decide the next move.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT"

Need to consider which apple would be best to target\n\nLooking at my options:\n- Moving UP would take me toward the apple at (1,9)\n- Moving DOWN would take me away from most apples\n\nStrategy:\nMoving UP seems like the best choice because:\n1. It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n2. It puts me on a path toward the apple at (1,9)\n3. It keeps my options open for future moves\n4. It doesn't trap me against any walls\n\nFor next turn, I should remember that I'm trying to reach the apple at (1,9) and plan accordingly.\n\nRIGHT"
