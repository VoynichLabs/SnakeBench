UP and LEFT both reduce the Manhattan distance to (0,6) by 1; RIGHT would increase distance; DOWN would move away. Since we want to keep future options open and head toward reachable apples, UP is a solid first step to align with the leftward path.\n\n- Decision: UP\n\n- Short-term plan (next turns): Turn 1: UP to (3,6). Turn 2: LEFT to (2,6). Turn 3: LEFT to (1,6). Turn 4: LEFT to (0,6) to eat the apple there. After that, reassess: aim for (0,7) or (1,7) next, while monitoring the enemy at (4,3) to avoid any head-on chances.

Moving RIGHT would allow it to eat the apple at (3, 6), which is also the closest apple to me.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- (3, 6) is the closest apple to me (Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |4-6| = 4).\n- (5, 2) is also close (Manhattan distance: |5-5| + |4-2| = 2).\n- Other apples are farther away or near the enemy.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- UP to (5, 5): Moves me away from (3, 6) (distance becomes 5) and (5, 2) (distance becomes 3). Keeps me central.\n- DOWN to (5, 3): Moves me closer to (5, 2) (distance becomes 1) and away from (3, 6) (distance becomes 5). Closer to bottom edge.\n- LEFT to (4, 4): Moves me closer to (3, 6) (distance becomes 3) and (5, 2) (distance becomes 3). Keeps me central.\n- RIGHT to (6, 4): Moves me away from (3, 6) (distance becomes 5) and (5, 2) (distance becomes 3). Closer to right edge.\n\n**Risks:**\n- The enemy is likely to move towards (3, 6), so moving LEFT or RIGHT could lead to a head-on collision if the enemy moves RIGHT. However, the enemy's body is at (2, 7), so it cannot move UP, making RIGHT a safer move for it.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 3) brings me very close to (5, 2), which is a safe apple to target. The enemy is less likely to compete for this apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Prioritize the apple at (5, 2) as it is close and not directly contested by the enemy.\n- Avoid moving towards the enemy's likely path (towards (3, 6)).\n- Maintain central positioning to keep future options open.\n- If the enemy moves towards (3, 6), focus on the apple at (5, 2) or other safe apples.\n- Avoid tight spaces or dead-ends.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is the best move as it brings me closer to the uncontested apple at (5, 2) while avoiding the enemy's likely path. It also keeps me in a central position with multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nDOWN",

Less optimal for short-term gain.\n- **DOWN/LEFT:** Invalid (death).\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy snake is likely to move UP to (7, 9) to eat the apple there.

(1, 5) is near my current body, so (3, 3) is a better target.\n- Enemy is likely to target (9, 3) this turn, so I should avoid competing for apples on the right side.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Moves me to (2, 9), which is safe and opens up paths to (0, 9) or (3, 8).

This is the best option for long-term apple targeting.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Enemy is likely to move UP to (9, 3) (apple), so I should avoid the right side of the board.\n- Moving UP to (2, 9) may lead to a dead-end if I later move to (0, 9).\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 7) reduces my space and may trap me.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move RIGHT this turn to (3, 8) to target (3, 3) while avoiding the enemy.\n- Next turn, assess enemy's position. If enemy moves to (9, 3), I can continue moving RIGHT or DOWN to reach (3, 3) or (1, 5).\n- Prioritize apples on the left side of the board to avoid competition with the enemy.\n- Maintain distance from the enemy to avoid being trapped or outmaneuvered.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

However, it avoids potential head-on collisions with the enemy snake if it moves toward the left side of the board.\n- The enemy snake is likely to move UP to (7, 7) to eat the apple there, which is far from my current position. This reduces the immediate threat from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Prioritize reaching (0, 6) first, as it is the closest apple. After eating it, reassess the board for the next closest apple, likely (1, 5).\n- Avoid the right side of the board where the enemy snake is active, unless it moves away.\n- Maintain flexibility by not boxing myself into tight spaces. Prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up options.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN",

This is a safe move but not the most optimal for reaching (3, 3).\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (0, 3), safe but not closer to any immediate apple.

The enemy is unlikely to move into (3, 3) this turn if I move RIGHT, as it would have to move DOWN from (3, 4) to (3, 3), which is possible but not guaranteed.\n- If the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3), I can still move UP to (2, 4) next turn to avoid collision and reassess.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps me flexible and closer to the apple at (3, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move RIGHT this turn to (2, 3) to position for (3, 3) next turn.\n- Next turn, prioritize moving UP to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (3, 3) depending on enemy movement.\n- Avoid the left side of the board where my body is clustered to prevent trapping myself.\n- Maintain distance from the enemy snake, especially near its head at (3, 4).\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

It keeps me alive and allows me to continue upward toward (0, 4), (0, 5), etc., then RIGHT to (1, 5) or (1, 6) to reach the apple at (1, 6).\n- The enemy is likely to move UP to (4, 2) or RIGHT to (5, 1). Neither threatens me immediately, but I should avoid the right side of the board where the enemy is dominant.\n- After moving UP, I can continue upward to avoid the enemy and reach the apple at (1, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Continue moving UP this turn to (0, 3) to survive and avoid the corner.\n- Next turns, continue moving UP to (0, 4), (0, 5), etc., then RIGHT to (1, 5) or (1, 6) to navigate toward the apple at (1, 6).\n- Avoid the right side of the board where the enemy is dominant.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking head-on collisions or tight spaces.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP",

If you move RIGHT to (5,1) now, you can eat that apple on the next turn by moving DOWN to (5,0). Going UP to (4,2) would lead toward the apple at (4,8) only if you can pass through or around a dense stretch of your own body around (4,4)\u2013(4,7); that path is dangerous and likely to cause self-collision before you reach it. Additionally, enemy snake #0 is far away and unlikely to threaten you in the immediate next move, so the safer route is to secure the nearby apple.\n\nPlan for the next moves:\n- Move RIGHT now to (5,1).\n- Next turn, move DOWN to (5,0) to eat the apple and grow.\n- After that, reassess: the board\u2019s apples are spread, so consider moving toward (9,8) or (4,8) or the others only if a clear, safe corridor exists; avoid racing into the dense area around your current vertical meat-bar (the cells (4,4)\u2013(4,7)) as you chase those farther apples.\n- Prioritize safety and option preservation: avoid any turns that would trap you or collide with your own body; watch for potential head-on with enemy heads if they move aggressively toward you.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (4, 8) is farther but reachable if I move right and up.\n- The enemy is dominant on the right side of the board, so I should avoid that area unless I can safely navigate it.\n\n**Possible Moves from (0, 6):**\n- **UP:** (0, 7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (0, 5) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (-1, 6) \u2013 off the board, death.\n- **RIGHT:** (1, 6) \u2013 contains an apple, safe.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (7, 0):**\n- **UP:** (7, 1) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (7, -1) \u2013 off the board, death.\n- **LEFT:** (6, 0) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 0) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- Likely moves: UP to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (8, 0). The enemy is likely to avoid its own body and move toward apples or open space.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (1, 6) is directly to the right of my head and is the safest immediate target.\n- The apple at (4, 8) is reachable but requires navigating around the enemy snake, which is risky.\n- Other apples are either too far or blocked by the enemy.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me to (1, 6), eating the apple. This is safe and directly achieves the goal of collecting an apple.\n- **UP:** Moves me to (0, 7), which is safe but doesn't immediately progress toward an apple. This could be a backup if RIGHT is deemed too risky, but RIGHT is clearly better.\n- **DOWN/LEFT:** Both result in death.\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 6) is the best move. It eats an apple, increases my score, and keeps me in a relatively safe position.\n- The enemy is unlikely to threaten me immediately, as it is focused on the right side of the board.\n- After eating the apple at (1, 6), I can continue moving right or up to pursue other apples or avoid the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **RIGHT** this turn to (1, 6) to eat the apple.\n- Next turns, assess the enemy's position and move toward (4, 8) or other reachable apples while avoiding the right side of the board if the enemy is too close.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking head-on collisions or tight spaces.\n- Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left corner by continuing to move upward or rightward as needed.\n- If the enemy moves toward me, prioritize maintaining space and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

This is a good move to avoid getting trapped and to position myself for future apple pursuit.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (0, 7), which is safe but risks trapping myself in the left side of the board. Not ideal for long-term mobility.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me to (2, 7), which is safe and moves me closer to the center of the board, opening more options for future moves. This is a strong candidate.\n- **DOWN:** Death.\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **UP** to (1, 8) is safe and keeps me aligned with the path toward (4, 8). However, it may limit my options if the enemy moves aggressively.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 7) is also safe and opens more future options by moving toward the center. This is preferable for long-term mobility and apple pursuit.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (0, 7) is safe but risks trapping myself in the left side, which is less ideal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **RIGHT** this turn to (2, 7) to position myself toward the center of the board and open more future options.\n- Next turns, assess the enemy's position and move toward (4, 8) or other reachable apples while avoiding the enemy's head and tight spaces.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking head-on collisions or getting trapped.\n- Avoid the left side of the board to maintain mobility and flexibility.\n- If the enemy moves toward me, prioritize maintaining space and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

The enemy is likely to avoid its own body and move toward apples or open space.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (4, 8) is the closest reachable target, but it requires navigating toward the enemy's territory.\n- The apple at (7, 4) is also reachable but risky due to the enemy's presence.\n- The apples at (9, 8), (7, 9), and (5, 9) are farther or blocked by the enemy.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Moves me to (2, 9), which is safe and opens a path toward (4, 8) or (5, 9). This is a good move to avoid getting trapped and to position myself for future apple pursuit.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (1, 8), which is safe but moves me closer to the left edge, potentially limiting future options.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me to (3, 8), which is safe and moves me closer to the center of the board, opening more options for future moves. This is a strong candidate.\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **UP** to (2, 9) is safe and aligns with the path toward (4, 8) or (5, 9). It also avoids the enemy's likely movement toward the right side of the board.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 8) is safe but moves me closer to the enemy's territory, which could be risky if the enemy moves aggressively.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 8) is safe but may limit future mobility.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **RIGHT** this turn to (3, 8) to position myself toward the apple at (4, 8) while maintaining flexibility.\n- Next turns, assess the enemy's position and continue moving toward (4, 8) or other reachable apples while avoiding head-on collisions.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking tight spaces or enemy encounters.\n- Avoid the left edge to maintain mobility and flexibility.\n- If the enemy moves toward me, prioritize maintaining space and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

Apples: 16.\n- **Apples at:** (9, 8), (7, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (0, 9).\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n- My snake's head is at (4, 8), with a long body trailing leftward and downward. The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (7, 4), with its body extending leftward and downward. It has just eaten the apple at (7, 4) last turn, so it will grow next turn.\n- The apples at (9, 8), (7, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), and (0, 9) are spread out. The apple at (4, 9) is directly above my head, and (0, 9) is far to the left.\n\n**Possible Moves from (4, 8):**\n- **UP:** (4, 9) \u2013 apple, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (4, 7) \u2013 empty, safe (but close to my body).\n- **LEFT:** (3, 8) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 8) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (7, 4):**\n- **UP:** (7, 5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (7, 3) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (6, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- Likely moves: UP to (7, 5) or RIGHT to (8, 4) to continue moving toward the top-right apples. The enemy is likely to avoid its own body and move toward open space or apples.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (4, 9) is directly above my head and is the closest reachable target. Moving UP to (4, 9) would allow me to eat it this turn.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is far to the left and blocked by my own body, making it unreachable in the short term.\n- The apples at (9, 8), (7, 9), and (5, 9) are in the top-right and may be contested by the enemy snake.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Moves me to (4, 9) to eat the apple. This is the best move to secure an apple immediately and increase my score.\n- **DOWN:** Moves me to (4, 7), which is safe but moves me away from apples and closer to my own body, limiting future options.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me to (5, 8), which is safe but moves me toward the enemy's territory and away from the closest apple.\n- **LEFT:** Not safe (my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **UP** to (4, 9) is the best move to secure an apple this turn. The enemy is likely to move away from this area, so the path should remain clear.\n- Moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** would delay reaching apples and may not improve my position significantly.\n- The enemy is likely to continue moving toward the top-right apples, so I should focus on securing the apple at (4, 9) and then reassess.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **UP** this turn to (4, 9) to eat the apple.\n- Next turns, assess the enemy's position and continue moving toward other reachable apples while avoiding head-on collisions.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable without risking tight spaces or enemy encounters.\n- Avoid the left edge to maintain mobility and flexibility.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively toward me, prioritize maintaining space and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP",

The enemy may also consider LEFT to (6, 7) to cut off my path.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (7, 9) is directly to my RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would allow me to eat it, but I must consider the enemy's likely moves.\n- The apple at (9, 9) is further right and may be targeted by the enemy.\n- The apple at (9, 8) is also in the top-right and may be contested.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is unreachable due to my body blocking the path.\n- The apple at (4, 5) is in the center but may be too far to reach safely.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me to (7, 9), eating the apple. However, if the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 7), our heads could collide at (8, 8) next turn if we both move RIGHT again. This is risky but high-reward.\n- **DOWN:** Moves me to (6, 8), which is safe but does not move me closer to any apples. This is a conservative move but may limit future options.\n- **UP/LEFT:** Both are unsafe (off the board or into my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 9) is the most aggressive move, allowing me to eat an apple and position myself closer to (9, 9). However, it risks a head-on collision with the enemy if they also move RIGHT.\n- The enemy is likely to move UP or RIGHT, so I should be cautious of their path. If they move RIGHT to (8, 7), I can still move DOWN next turn to avoid a collision.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (6, 8) is safe but does not advance my position. It may be better to take the risk and move RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **RIGHT** this turn to (7, 9) to eat the apple and position myself closer to (9, 9).\n- Next turns, assess the enemy's movement. If they move RIGHT, I should move DOWN to avoid a head-on collision.\n- Prioritize apples that are safely reachable while maintaining space and avoiding tight spots.\n- Avoid the left edge to maintain mobility and flexibility.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively, prioritize survival and space over apple collection.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (7, 8), with its body extending downward and leftward. It moved UP from (7, 7) to (7, 8) last turn, likely targeting the apples at (9, 8) or (9, 9).\n- The apple at (9, 9) is directly above the enemy's head, and (9, 8) is to its left. The apple at (0, 9) is blocked by my body.

This is the best move to contest the top-right apples.\n- **UP/DOWN/LEFT:** All are unsafe (off the board, head-on collision, or into my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 9) is the only safe move and keeps me in contention for the top-right apples.\n- The enemy is likely to move RIGHT to (8, 8) or UP to (7, 9). If they move UP, we both die, which is acceptable since I have a 1-apple lead. If they move RIGHT, I can move UP next turn to (8, 10) (death) or RIGHT to (9, 9) (eat the apple).\n- Moving RIGHT now maximizes my chances of eating (9, 9) before the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **RIGHT** this turn to (8, 9) to position myself for (9, 9).\n- Next turns, prioritize eating (9, 9) while avoiding head-on collisions. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 8), I can move RIGHT to (9, 9) to eat the apple.\n- Avoid the left edge and maintain mobility.

The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (6, 7), with its body extending upward and leftward. It moved DOWN from (6, 8) to (6, 7) last turn.\n- The apple at (9, 8) is directly above my head. The apple at (0, 9) is blocked by my body. The apples at (4, 5) and (5, 4) are in the center, and (2, 1) is near my tail.\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 9):**\n- **UP:** (9, 10) \u2013 off the board, death.\n- **DOWN:** (9, 8) \u2013 apple, safe (no immediate collision).\n- **LEFT:** (8, 9) \u2013 my own body, death (directly backwards).\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 9) \u2013 off the board, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (6, 7):**\n- **UP:** (6, 8) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **DOWN:** (6, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (5, 7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 7) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- Likely moves: DOWN to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 7).\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (9, 8) is directly above my head and is the most valuable.

This is the best move as it secures a valuable apple and extends my lead.\n- **UP/LEFT/RIGHT:** Unsafe (off the board or into my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 8) is safe and allows me to eat the apple, extending my lead to 19-16. This is the optimal move.\n- The enemy is likely to move DOWN or LEFT, avoiding death. If it moves aggressively, it may contest the center apples, but I can focus on maintaining space.\n- After eating (9, 8), I will have a 3-apple lead and can focus on avoiding tight spaces.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **DOWN** this turn to (9, 8) to eat the apple and extend my lead.\n- Next turns, prioritize maintaining space and avoiding head-on collisions. The enemy may try to contest the center apples, so I should avoid moving into tight spaces.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively, focus on survival and space.

Apples: 16.\n- **Apples at:** (0, 9), (4, 5), (2, 1), (5, 4), (6, 4).\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n- My snake's head is at (9, 7), with a long body trailing leftward and downward. The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (6, 5), with its body extending upward and leftward. It moved DOWN from (6, 6) to (6, 5) last turn.\n- The apple at (5, 4) is near the enemy's body, and (6, 4) is adjacent to it. The apple at (4, 5) is in the center, (2, 1) is near my tail, and (0, 9) is blocked by my body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 7):**\n- **UP:** (9, 8) \u2013 my own body, death (directly backwards).\n- **DOWN:** (9, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (8, 7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 7) \u2013 off the board, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (6, 5):**\n- **UP:** (6, 6) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **DOWN:** (6, 4) \u2013 empty, safe (could eat apple at (6, 4)).\n- **LEFT:** (5, 5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 5) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- Likely moves: DOWN to (6, 4) (to eat apple) or LEFT to (5, 5).\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (5, 4) is in the center and may be contested by the enemy. The apple at (6, 4) is adjacent to the enemy's head and likely to be eaten this turn.\n- The apple at (4, 5) is further away but less contested.\n- The apple at (2, 1) is near my tail and not a priority.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is unreachable due to my body blocking the path.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **DOWN:** Moves me to (9, 6), which is safe and opens up space to the left. This avoids immediate danger and keeps options open.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (8, 7), which is also safe but may lead to tighter spaces if the enemy moves aggressively toward the center.\n- **UP/RIGHT:** Unsafe (into my own body or off the board).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 6) is safe and maintains mobility. It avoids the enemy's likely moves (DOWN to (6, 4) or LEFT to (5, 5)) and keeps me away from potential head-on collisions.\n- The enemy is likely to eat the apple at (6, 4) this turn, so I should avoid moving into that area.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 7) could position me closer to the center apples (e.g., (5, 4) or (4, 5)), but it also risks getting trapped if the enemy moves aggressively.\n- After moving DOWN, I can reassess the board and prioritize moving leftward in future turns to reach the center apples while avoiding the enemy's head.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **DOWN** this turn to (9, 6) to maintain safety and mobility.\n- Next turns, prioritize moving leftward to reach the center apples (e.g., (5, 4) or (4, 5)) while avoiding the enemy's head.\n- Avoid the left edge and maintain space to prevent being trapped. If the enemy moves aggressively, focus on survival and space.\n- If I can secure more apples in the center or top-right, I can extend my lead further.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN",

It avoids the enemy's likely moves (LEFT to (5, 4) or DOWN to (6, 3)) and keeps me away from potential head-on collisions.\n- The enemy is likely to eat the apple at (5, 4) this turn, so I should avoid moving into that area.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 6) could position me closer to the center apples (e.g., (4, 5)), but it also risks getting trapped if the enemy moves aggressively.\n- After moving DOWN, I can reassess the board and prioritize moving leftward in future turns to reach the center apples while avoiding the enemy's head.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **DOWN** this turn to (9, 5) to maintain safety and mobility.\n- Next turns, prioritize moving leftward to reach the center apples (e.g., (4, 5)) while avoiding the enemy's head.\n- Avoid the left edge and maintain space to prevent being trapped. If the enemy moves aggressively, focus on survival and space.\n- If I can secure more apples in the center or top-right, I can extend my lead further.\n\nDOWN",

The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (5, 4), with its body extending upward and leftward. It likely moved LEFT to (5, 4) last turn to eat the apple at (5, 4).\n- The apple at (4, 5) is in the center and uncontested. The apple at (5, 5) is near the enemy's head. The apple at (3, 3) is near my tail, and (0, 9) is blocked by my body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 5):**\n- **UP:** (9, 6) \u2013 my own body, death (directly backwards).\n- **DOWN:** (9, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (8, 5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 5) \u2013 off the board, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (5, 4):**\n- **UP:** (5, 5) \u2013 apple, safe (could eat apple at (5, 5)).\n- **DOWN:** (5, 3) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (4, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 4) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- Likely moves: UP to (5, 5) (to eat apple) or DOWN to (5, 3).\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (5, 5) is likely to be eaten by the enemy this turn if it moves UP.\n- The apple at (4, 5) is in the center and less contested.\n- The apple at (3, 3) is near my tail but not a priority.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is unreachable due to my body blocking the path.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **DOWN:** Moves me to (9, 4), which is safe and opens up space to the left.

The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (5, 5), having just eaten the apple at (5, 5). Its body extends leftward and downward.\n- The apple at (4, 5) is now the most accessible in the center. The apple at (3, 6) is near my body but not immediately reachable. The apple at (0, 9) is blocked by my body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 4):**\n- **UP:** (9, 5) \u2013 my own body, death (directly backwards).\n- **DOWN:** (9, 3) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (8, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 4) \u2013 off the board, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (5, 5):**\n- **UP:** (5, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (5, 4) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (4, 5) \u2013 apple, safe (could eat apple at (4, 5)).\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 5) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- Likely moves: LEFT to (4, 5) (to eat the apple) or UP to (5, 6).\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (4, 5) is now the most critical. If the enemy moves LEFT, it will eat this apple. I need to prioritize reaching it first or blocking the enemy.\n- The apple at (3, 6) is near my body but not immediately reachable. The apple at (0, 9) is blocked by my body.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **DOWN:** Moves me to (9, 3), which is safe but moves me further from the center apples. This is not ideal for reaching (4, 5).\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (8, 4), which is safe and positions me closer to the center. This is the best move to contest the apple at (4, 5) and avoid the enemy's likely LEFT move.\n- **UP/RIGHT:** Unsafe (into my own body or off the board).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 4) is the best option. It positions me closer to the apple at (4, 5) and avoids the enemy's likely LEFT move to (4, 5). If the enemy moves LEFT, I can still maneuver around it.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 3) is safe but less strategic, as it moves me away from the center and the apple at (4, 5).\n- The enemy is likely to move LEFT to (4, 5) to eat the apple, so I need to be proactive in contesting that space.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **LEFT** this turn to (8, 4) to position myself closer to the center and the apple at (4, 5).\n- Next turns, prioritize moving leftward to reach the apple at (4, 5) while avoiding the enemy's head. If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 5), I can maneuver around it or block it.\n- Avoid the left edge and maintain space to prevent being trapped. Focus on securing apples in the center or top-right to extend my lead.\n- If the enemy moves aggressively, prioritize survival and space.\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 20.\n- **Apples at:** (0, 9), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (8, 7).\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n- My snake's head is at (8, 5), with a long body trailing leftward and downward. The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (3, 5), with its body extending rightward and downward. It is positioned near the center-left.\n- The apple at (8, 7) is directly above my head and seems immediately reachable.\n- The apple at (3, 6) is near the enemy's head and my body, but not immediately accessible.\n- The apples at (0, 9), (2, 1), and (3, 3) are far or blocked by my body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (8, 5):**\n- **UP:** (8, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (8, 4) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (7, 5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 5) \u2013 my own body, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (3, 5):**\n- **UP:** (3, 6) \u2013 apple, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (3, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **LEFT:** (2, 5) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 5) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- Likely moves: UP to (3, 6) to eat the apple or LEFT to (2, 5) to avoid my head.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (8, 7) is directly above my head and the closest. Moving UP to (8, 6) positions me to eat it next turn.\n- The apple at (3, 6) is near the enemy's head, and the enemy is likely to move UP to eat it.\n- The other apples are not immediately reachable or are blocked by my body.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Moves me to (8, 6), which is safe and positions me to eat the apple at (8, 7) next turn. This is the best move to secure a nearby apple.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (7, 5), which is safe but moves me away from the apple at (8, 7) and toward the center, where the enemy might move.\n- **DOWN/RIGHT:** Unsafe (into my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **UP** to (8, 6) is the best option. It positions me to eat the apple at (8, 7) next turn and avoids the enemy's likely moves (UP or LEFT). This also keeps me away from the enemy's head and maintains space.\n- Moving **LEFT** would limit my options and move me toward the enemy's likely path.\n- The enemy is likely to move UP to (3, 6) to eat the apple, so I should avoid moving toward its head.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **UP** this turn to (8, 6) to position myself for the apple at (8, 7).\n- Next turn, move UP to (8, 7) to eat the apple.\n- After eating the apple, focus on maintaining space and avoiding the enemy's head. Prioritize apples in the top-right or center.\n- Avoid tight spaces and the left edge to prevent being trapped. Keep an eye on the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

It is positioned near the center-left.\n- The apple at (8, 7) is directly above my head and is the closest and most immediately reachable.\n- The apple at (9, 1) is in the bottom-right, but it is far and blocked by my body.\n- The other apples are either far or blocked by my body or the enemy's body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (8, 6):**\n- **UP:** (8, 7) \u2013 apple, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (8, 5) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (7, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 6) \u2013 my own body, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (3, 6):**\n- **UP:** (3, 7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (3, 5) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (2, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 6) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- Likely moves: UP to (3, 7) to avoid my head or LEFT to (2, 6) to create space.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The apple at (8, 7) is directly above my head and is the best immediate target. Moving UP to (8, 7) will allow me to eat it this turn.\n- The other apples are not immediately reachable or are blocked by my body or the enemy's body.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Moves me to (8, 7) to eat the apple. This is the best move as it secures an apple and increases my score.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (7, 6), which is safe but moves me away from the apple at (8, 7) and toward the center, where the enemy might move.\n- **DOWN/RIGHT:** Unsafe (into my own body).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **UP** to (8, 7) is the best option. It allows me to eat the apple and increase my score, which is critical given the enemy's lead.\n- The enemy is likely to move UP or LEFT to avoid my head, so moving UP keeps me safe from head-on collisions.\n- After eating the apple, I will need to focus on maintaining space and avoiding tight spots, especially near the enemy's head.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **UP** this turn to (8, 7) to eat the apple.\n- Next turn, assess the board for the next closest apple or safe path. Prioritize apples in the top-right or center.\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy's head or into tight spaces. Keep an eye on the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n- If possible, try to block the enemy's access to apples or force them into tight spaces.\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all currently safe since they don\u2019t collide with any known bodies on this turn.\n- Best immediate plan: choose UP to (3,7). It keeps you away from your own coil and opens a path toward the apple at (8,7) by moving along the 7th rank, while preserving multiple safe follow-ups in the next turns. This also minimizes the risk of a head-on collision with the enemy at (8,6) right now since you\u2019re far from their position.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move toward the apple at (8,7) by advancing along y=7 (e.g., from (3,7) to (8,7) if safe) while monitoring snake #0\u2019s movement near the top-right.\n- If the top path becomes contested or risky (like a potential head-on at (8,7)), pivot toward safer apples such as (2,1) and chart a route that avoids tight spaces with your growing body.\n- Always avoid turning into your own body and try to keep multiple escape routes open for future turns.\n\nUP",

Apples: 21.\n- **Apples at:** (0, 9), (2, 1), (3, 3), (9, 1), (4, 2).\n\n**Board Visualization:**\n- My snake's head is at (8, 8), with a long body trailing leftward and downward. The body is mostly vertical and horizontal in the bottom-left and center.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (4, 7), with its body extending rightward and downward. It is positioned near the center-left.\n- The closest apples are (9, 1) (bottom-right) and (4, 2) (center-left). The apple at (9, 1) is partially blocked by my body, while (4, 2) is near the enemy's head.\n- The apple at (3, 3) is near the enemy's head, and (2, 1) is bottom-left, far away.\n- The apple at (0, 9) is top-left, far and blocked by my body.\n\n**Possible Moves from (8, 8):**\n- **UP:** (8, 9) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **DOWN:** (8, 7) \u2013 my own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (7, 8) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 8) \u2013 my own body, death.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (4, 7):**\n- **UP:** (4, 8) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- **DOWN:** (4, 6) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **LEFT:** (3, 7) \u2013 its own body, death.\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n- Likely moves: UP to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 7) to avoid my head or create space.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- The only safe move is LEFT to (7, 8), which moves me away from the enemy's head and toward the apple at (9, 1) in the long term.\n- The apple at (9, 1) is the most accessible, but I need to navigate around my own body to reach it.\n- The apple at (4, 2) is risky due to proximity to the enemy's head.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (7, 8), which is safe and opens up future options toward the apple at (9, 1).\n- **UP/DOWN/RIGHT:** All lead to death.\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (7, 8) is the only safe option. It keeps me away from the enemy's head and avoids immediate danger.\n- After moving LEFT, I should continue moving leftward to loop around my body and approach the apple at (9, 1).\n- The enemy is likely to move UP or RIGHT, so I should avoid moving toward (4, 8) or (5, 7) in the next turns to prevent head-on collisions.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move **LEFT** this turn to (7, 8) to stay safe and maintain space.\n- Next turns, continue moving leftward to loop around my body and approach the apple at (9, 1).\n- Avoid the enemy's head and tight spaces, prioritizing survival and apple collection.\n- Monitor the enemy's movements to avoid head-on collisions and maintain a lead in apples.\n\nLEFT",
