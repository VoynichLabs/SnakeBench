Tail will pop (originally at (8,4)), so now it's just [(7,4), (8,4)].\n    - **So, as of now: Head at (7,4), body at [(8,4), (7,4)]. Length: 3.**\n\n### (B) Open Directions from (7,4):\n- **UP (7,5):** . (empty)\n- **DOWN (7,3):** . (empty)\n- **LEFT (6,4):** . (empty)\n- **RIGHT (8,4):** occupied by own body (danger of self-collision).\n\n### (C) Apples:\n- (0,1), (3,4), (0,0), (4,2), (5,2).\n\n### (D) Enemies:\n- Enemy snake's head at (5,1), body at [(6,1)].\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Safe Moves Assessment:**\n- **UP (7,5):** Open.\n- **DOWN (7,3):** Open.\n- **LEFT (6,4):** Open.\n- **RIGHT (8,4):** Occupied by your own body (fatal self-collision).\n\nSo: Safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Distances from (7,4) to Apples:**\n- (3,4): |7-3| + |4-4| = 4\n- (4,2): |7-4| + |4-2| = 3+2=5\n- (5,2): |7-5| + |4-2| = 2+2=4\n- (0,1): |7-0| + |4-1| = 7+3=10\n- (0,0): |7-0| + |4-0| = 7+4=11\n\n**Closest apple is now (3,4)** (distance 4). Next closest: (5,2) (distance 4), (4,2) (5).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Which Directions Progress You to the Closest Apple?**\n- To reach (3,4), must decrease X from 7 down towards 3.\n- Directions:\n    - **LEFT (6,4):** X decreases. Still on same row as apple (Y=4).\n    - **UP or DOWN:** Would move you off the path or away.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Check for Traps or Hazards**\n\n- Is LEFT safe next turn? Let's visualize progression:\n    - Move to (6,4). Next moves: From (6,4), can go LEFT (5,4), etc.\n    - The enemy snake is at (5,1): far below, not a threat for now.\n    - No walls in the way (still at least 3 tiles from left edge).\n    - Your own body: (8,4) is to the right, (7,4) is current, so no immediate self-collision.\n    - After moving LEFT, your body will be [(6,4), (7,4), (8,4)] (tail at (8,4) unless you eat an apple).\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Double-Check: Should You EVER Go UP or DOWN Here?**\n\n- UP (7,5): doesn't progress toward any apples.\n- DOWN (7,3): again, doesn't help with apples, unless you want to cut toward southern apples later.\n- LEFT (6,4): continues toward (3,4).\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Enemy Threat?**\n\n- Enemy is not between you and your goal. You have a clear, safe line to (3,4).\n- You are on the far right; enemy is lower central. No race or blocking likely.\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Summary and Strategy**\n\n**Move LEFT again to continue approaching the apple at (3,4).**  \nMaintain high awareness about your following positions\u2014should the enemy snake suddenly move for apples at (4,2) or (5,2), reconsider priorities. Also, check for possible long-term entrapment as your body grows.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for next turn to self:\nAfter moving LEFT, assess which apple is best: if the direct approach to (3,4) remains clear, continue; otherwise, consider down toward (4,2) or (5,2) if new obstacles emerge.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE:**  \n**LEFT**"

Legal Moves from (6, 4)\n\n- **UP (6,5):** Empty.\n- **DOWN (6,3):** Empty.\n- **LEFT (5,4):** Empty.\n- **RIGHT (7,4):** My own body (would collide, not allowed).\n\nSo, valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n### 3. Goals\n\nMy goal remains unchanged: Eat apples quickly and safely. The nearest apple is at (3,4), directly to the left.\n\n### 4. Path to (3,4)\n\nCurrent: (6,4)\n- (5,4): 1 LEFT\n- (4,4): 2 LEFT\n- (3,4): 3 LEFT (apple!)\n\nNo obstructions in this lane. My own tail will move forward so I won't run into it if I keep going left.\n\n### 5. Threat Assessment\n\n- **Enemy:** Head at (3,1), likely to head for apples lower on the board. There is no imminent threat between (6,4) and (3,4).\n- **Self:** Cannot move RIGHT (my own body).\n- **Walls:** Nowhere near.\n\n### 6. Alternative options (UP/DOWN)\n\n- **UP (6,5):** Would bring me out of the direct path to the apple.\n- **DOWN (6,3):** Could set up going for apples at (5,2)/(4,2) later, but less optimal right now.\n\n### 7. Plan\n\nKeep moving LEFT toward (3,4). This remains the most direct and safe plan to get the nearest apple.\n\n### 8. Next Turn Strategy Note\n\n- After eating (3,4), reconsider route.

My Current Situation\n\n- **Head:** (3, 4)\n- **Body:** [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n- **Last move:** LEFT\n- **Just ate:** I will have grown, so my body includes my previous head.\n- The nearest apple at (3, 4) must have just been eaten\u2014so I\u2019ll be at the new spot.\n\n## 2. Board Update After My Last Turn\n\n- **I just moved from (4, 4) to (3, 4) and ate the apple at (3, 4).** \n- My new head: (3, 4)\n- My body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), ...] (depends if the tail shrinks, but after eating: body grows)\n- **Tail**: Still at (6, 4) (will not move this turn because I just grew).\n\n## 3. Enemy Snake\u2019s Location\n\n- **Enemy (#0):** head at (4, 1), body at [(3, 1), (3, 0)]. Not an immediate threat, far below me.\n\n## 4. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 0)\n- (4, 2)\n- (5, 2)\n- (1, 8)\n\n## 5. Legal Moves From (3, 4)\n\nLet's look at neighboring cells:\n\n- **UP (3, 5):** Board is empty here.\n- **DOWN (3, 3):** Empty.\n- **LEFT (2, 4):** Empty.\n- **RIGHT (4, 4):** My own body (don't do it).\n\nSo, possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n## 6. Strategic Considerations\n\n### Shortest Paths to Apples\nLet\u2019s quickly check how I\u2019d get closest to more apples:\n\n- **Left-side apples (0,1),(0,0):**\n    - From (3,4): LEFT to (2,4), then further left and down.\n- **Center-lower apples (4,2),(5,2):**\n    - Need to go DOWN from (3,4) towards (3,2) then over.\n- **Top apple (1,8):**\n    - Far away, not optimal unless no safer options.\n\n### Is there any threat?\n- Enemy snake is nowhere near\u2014no near collision.\n- My tail at (6,4) will persist, but as I just ate, body grew by one. But my current tail\u2019s not in play for my current direction.\n\n### Next Best Apple?\n- **(0,1)** and **(0,0)** are closest.\n- Path: Go LEFT, then start working down.\n    - (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (0,4) then drop down towards apples.\n\n- Alternatively, **(4,2)** or **(5,2)** are on the way down if I go DOWN now, but not much closer.\n\n### Which is safer?\n- Going LEFT seems safe (open, away from enemy), AND keeps me away from my own trailing body.\n- Going DOWN is a little more congested (with enemy further below, but not immediate).\n- UP is just toward more open board, but not toward any apples.\n\n## 7. Final Comparison\n\n- **LEFT (to 2,4):** Gets me closer to (0,1)/(0,0), no obstacles.\n- **DOWN (to 3,3):** Eventually leads to apples at (5,2)/(4,2), but less direct.\n- **UP:** Useless right now.\n\n## 8. Next Turn Note\n\n- As I head left, once at column 0, start down for (0,1)/(0,0). If enemy detours upward, I can reconsider for central apples at (4,2)/(5,2).\n\n---\n\n## **Decision**\n\n**MOVE: LEFT**\n\n**(Move to (2,4), continue working toward the left apples. Safe, efficient, no threats.)**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn Reminder:**  \n- Keep heading left unless threat or blocked.\n- At column 0, begin heading down for apples at (0,1) and (0,0).\n- If enemy starts approaching, reconsider route for middle-bottom apples."

The closest apples remain at (0,1) and (0,0) \u2014 bottom left corner.\n\n## 2. **Available Moves**\n\nLet's check every direction from (2,3):\n\n- **LEFT (1,3):** Not occupied by you or the enemy. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (3,3):** Occupied by your own body. Unsafe.\n- **UP (2,4):** Not occupied, safe.\n- **DOWN (2,2):** Not occupied, safe.\n\n## 3. **Which Move Is Best?**\n\n- **LEFT (1,3):** Direct route toward apples at (0,1), (0,0).\n- **UP (2,4):** Toward the top, away from nearby apples.\n- **DOWN (2,2):** Could eventually move toward apples, but would need a zig-zag -- less direct and could bring you closer to enemy\u2019s zone.\n- **RIGHT:** Unsafe, into yourself.\n\nBest to continue **LEFT toward the apples**.\n\n## 4. **Strategy for Future Moves**\n\n- After reaching the left edge (x=0), drop DOWN (assuming path clear) toward (0,1) and (0,0).\n- Remember to check for self-trapping as your snake grows.\n- Check if enemy pivots toward left side; for now, no immediate threat from them.\n- Keep aware of apple at (1,8): if you clear the bottom, you might consider heading up left column for (1,8), then (0,9).\n\n## 5. **Okay, Next Move**\n\n**Move:**  \n**LEFT**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nIf (1,3) is safe (it is), proceed to (0,3). From there, choose DOWN toward apples at (0,1) and (0,0) (monitor for traps). Double-check enemy\u2019s movement and updated apple placements each turn. Avoid rapid turns that cause self-collision if you grow.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \n**LEFT**"
