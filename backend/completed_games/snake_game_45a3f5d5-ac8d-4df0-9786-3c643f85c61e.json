RIGHT to (2,0) is safe too but also doesn't get an apple and could allow enemy to contest nearby space next turn.\n- No other snake bodies are on the board, so no immediate body collisions. Also moving UP keeps multiple follow-up options (I can continue toward apples at (0,7),(2,6),(2,8) etc.), and avoids moving into a space the enemy could contest this turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take the apple at (1,1) now (UP). After that, evaluate enemy's move; prioritize staying in open space and collecting nearby apples on the left-half (0-3 x-range) while avoiding head-on approaches to the enemy head around x\u22482-4.\n\nUP",

The Enemy is in the bottom left corner. I am at $(2, 1)$. I am close to the apple at $(2, 2)$.\n    *   Is there a risk? The Enemy is at $(1, 0)$. If I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$, I am adjacent to the Enemy. If the Enemy moves RIGHT to $(2, 0)$, we are still safe.\n    *   Let's look at the board geometry. The corner is deadly. I want to keep the Enemy in the corner. If I move RIGHT, I leave the Enemy open to expanding. If I move LEFT, I maintain pressure on the bottom-left quadrant.\n    *   Specifically, if I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$:\n        *   I am next to the apple at $(2, 2)$.\n        *   I am closer to the Enemy.\n        *   I can potentially trap the Enemy against the wall/corner on subsequent turns.\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   Destination $(3, 2)$.\n    *   Apples: $(4, 2)$ is an apple (1 step right). $(2, 2)$ is an apple (1 step left).\n    *   This is a central move.\n    *   However, moving UP moves me away from the Enemy in the bottom left. The Enemy is at $(1, 0)$. If I go UP, the Enemy has free reign over the bottom and left walls.\n    *   I want to control the board and limit the Enemy's options.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI want to control the board and put pressure on the Enemy.\nMoving LEFT to $(2, 1)$ seems optimal.\n1.  It gets me closer to the apple at $(2, 2)$.\n2.  It keeps me near the bottom left where the Enemy is trapped. By staying nearby, I can potentially cut off the Enemy's escape routes as the game progresses.\n3.  It is safe from immediate collision. The Enemy cannot reach $(2, 1)$ this turn (from $(1, 0)$) because they move 1 cell.\n\nLet's double check the collision rules.\nIf I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$.\nIf Enemy moves UP to $(1, 1)$.\nWe are at $(2, 1)$ and $(1, 1)$. No collision.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to $(2, 0)$.\nWe are at $(2, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$. No collision.\nIf Enemy moves UP and I move LEFT, next turn I could potentially move to $(1, 1)$ or $(1, 2)$ while they are at $(1, 1)$ or $(2, 1)$... but that's future calculation.\n\nCurrent safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nLEFT positions me to grab the apple at $(2, 2)$ next turn (by moving UP).\nRIGHT positions me to grab the apple at $(5, 1)$ in a few turns.\nUP positions me between two apples but leaves the Enemy alone in the corner.\n\nIn Snake, controlling space and trapping the opponent is key. The Enemy is in a corner $(1, 0)$. Moving LEFT to $(2, 1)$ keeps me close to that corner. If I stay close, I can potentially force the Enemy into a dead end as they try to expand, or I can simply eat the apple at $(2, 2)$ and grow.\n\nLet's verify coordinates.\nBottom left is $(0, 0)$.\nI am at $(3, 1)$.\nEnemy at $(1, 0)$.\nApple at $(2, 2)$.\nMoving LEFT puts me at $(2, 1)$. From there, moving UP gets me the apple.\nMoving UP puts me at $(3, 2)$. From there, moving LEFT gets me the apple.\nMoving RIGHT puts me at $(4, 1)$.\n\nThe most direct path to the apple is LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT.\nLEFT then UP also keeps me closer to the Enemy.\nIf I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$, I am on column 2, row 1.\nThe Enemy is on column 1, row 0.\nThis gives me a strong position to compete for the bottom-left area.\n\nWait, if I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$ and the Enemy moves UP to $(1, 1)$, I am at $(2, 1)$ and they are at $(1, 1)$. I am \"above\" them relative to the wall.\nIf I move UP to $(3, 2)$, I am moving away from the Enemy.\nI prefer to move towards the Enemy to limit their expansion, especially early game when the board is open.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at $(4, 2)$ which is closer to UP move. But $(2, 2)$ is also an apple.\nThe apple at $(2, 2)$ is closer to the Enemy. If I take it, I deny it from the Enemy (if they ever get there) and I grow.\nThe apple at $(4, 2)$ is safer but less strategic for trapping.\n\nLet's consider the \"Block\" strategy.\nIf I move LEFT to $(2, 1)$.\nIf the Enemy moves UP to $(1, 1)$.\nNext turn, I can move to $(1, 1)$ (if Enemy doesn't move there again, but they just moved there, so they might be there next turn... wait, if they are at $(1, 1)$, I can't go there).\nWait, if I am at $(2, 1)$ and Enemy is at $(1, 1)$.\nI can move UP to $(2, 2)$ (apple).\nEnemy is at $(1, 1)$. They can move to $(1, 2)$, $(2, 1)$, or $(0, 1)$, or $(1, 0)$.\nIf I am at $(2, 2)$, I am safe.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT to $(4, 1)$?\nThe Enemy is far away. The game becomes a race for apples. Since the Enemy is trapped in the corner, I should use that to my advantage now. If I run away to the right, I give the Enemy time to escape the corner and grow.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the best way to apply pressure.\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\nMy move: LEFT to $(2, 1)$.\nEnemy move possibilities:\n1.  UP to $(1, 1)$: Safe.\n2.  RIGHT to $(2, 0)$: Safe.\n3.  LEFT to $(0, 0)$: Safe.\n4.  DOWN to $(1, -1)$: Invalid (Enemy dies). I am safe regardless.\n\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nIs UP better?\nUP to $(3, 2)$.\nThis puts me on an apple row (row 2 has apples at $x=2, 4, 6$).\nBut it moves me away from the Enemy.\nIf I move UP, the Enemy can move UP to $(1, 1)$.\nNow the Enemy is at $(1, 1)$. They are no longer in the deepest part of the corner.\nThis allows them more freedom.\nBy moving LEFT to $(2, 1)$, I keep the pressure on.\nEven if the Enemy moves UP to $(1, 1)$, I am at $(2, 1)$.\nIf the Enemy moves RIGHT to $(2, 0)$, I am at $(2, 1)$.\nIn both cases, I am \"hemming them in\" against the wall/corner.\n\nLet's look at the apple at $(2, 2)$.\nIf I go LEFT $(2, 1)$ -> UP $(2, 2)$. I eat the apple.\nIf I go UP $(3, 2)$ -> LEFT $(2, 2)$. I eat the apple.\nBoth paths take 2 turns to eat the apple.\nHowever, the path LEFT then UP keeps me closer to the Enemy for the first turn.\nIn early game, control and positioning are as important as food, especially when the opponent is cornered.\n\nFinal check:\nCoordinates: $(3, 1)$.\nLeft is $(2, 1)$. Is it on board? Yes ($0 \\le x \\le 9, 0 \\le y \\le 9$).\nIs it occupied? No.\nIs it a backwards move? No (Body is empty).\nIs it a wall? No.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT.\n\n**Strategy Note (for future self):**\nThe Enemy is trapped in the bottom-left corner at $(1, 0)$. By moving LEFT to $(2, 1)$, I maintain proximity to control their expansion. My plan is to secure the apple at $(2, 2)$ next turn. This approach keeps the Enemy confined while allowing me to grow. Avoid letting the Enemy escape the corner freely.\n\nLEFT",

Length 1.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (1, 1). Body at (1, 0). Length 2. Apples: 1.\n- **Apples:** Multiple apples are present. Notably, an apple is at (2, 2), which is directly adjacent to my current position (2, 1).\n- **Coordinates:** Bottom-left is (0,0), Top-right is (9,9).\n\n**Move Evaluation (from current position (2, 1)):**\n\n1.  **DOWN:** Moving to (2, 0). This is within board bounds. There are no obstacles or snake bodies at (2, 0). It is a safe move.\n2.  **UP:** Moving to (2, 2). This is within board bounds. There is an apple at (2, 2). Eating an apple grows the snake and increases score. There are no snake bodies at (2, 2). This is a safe move.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving to (1, 1). This is within board bounds. However, the enemy snake's head is currently at (1, 1). Moving into a cell occupied by another snake's head results in a head-on collision (both die). This move is unsafe.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moving to (3, 1). This is within board bounds. There are no obstacles or snake bodies at (3, 1). It is a safe move.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe objective is to survive and maximize apples. Between the safe moves (DOWN, UP, RIGHT):\n-   **DOWN** moves me further away from the cluster of apples and moves toward the edge of the board (y=0), which limits future mobility.\n-   **RIGHT** moves me horizontally but away from the apples at (2, 2) and (4, 2).\n-   **UP** moves me directly onto an apple at (2, 2). Eating this apple is beneficial immediately. Furthermore, being at (2, 2) positions me well for the next turn, as I will be near other apples and have multiple open directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), maintaining high mobility.\n\nWhile the enemy snake is close (at (1, 1)), moving UP to (2, 2) is safe because the enemy cannot reach (2, 2) in a single move from (1, 1) (max distance 1). I am securing food while maintaining safety.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to (2, 2).\n\nUP",

It doesn't give me a clear tactical advantage and increases risk of unpredictable head-on interactions.\n- LEFT -> (0,1) is safe and moves me to the left edge; it would also leave my previous head (1,1) as a body segment that could kill the enemy if they try to move into it. However, hugging x=0 reduces immediate maneuvering space.\n- UP -> (1,2) is safe, keeps me away from the bottom edge, moves me toward the cluster of apples to the north/NE (like the apples around x=2,y=6/8 and others), and also leaves my previous head (1,1) as a body segment\u2014so if the enemy tries to move LEFT into (1,1) they would die. UP preserves more future options (I can go left, right, or continue up next turn) and pressures space toward apples.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (1,2) to maintain flexibility and pressure the enemy around (2,1). If the enemy tries to contest by moving into (1,1), they'll die by moving into my body. Next turns, continue toward the nearby apple cluster (favoring reachable apples at lower risk) while avoiding head-on duels unless they clearly benefit me.\n\nUP",

The Enemy has a body segment at (1, 3).\n\n**Immediate Threat Analysis:**\nSimultaneous movement means I must calculate the enemy's potential moves to avoid head-on collision.\n- If I stay at (2, 4) and the Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we collide and both die. This is bad.\n- If I move RIGHT to (3, 4) and the Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we are safe (no collision).\n- If I move UP to (2, 5) and the Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we are safe.\n- If I move DOWN to (2, 3) and the Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we are safe.\n- If I move LEFT to (1, 4) and the Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we swap heads (safe).\n- If I move LEFT to (1, 4) and the Enemy moves UP/DOWN, we collide head-on (both die).\n\n**Safety Check for Moves:**\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 4):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** High. The Enemy is currently at (1, 4). If the Enemy stays or moves into (1, 4) while I move LEFT, we collide. The Enemy is trapped at y=3 (body) and y=4 (head). If it moves UP to (1, 5), I survive. If it moves DOWN to (1, 3) [its own body], it dies. If it moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we swap (safe). If it stays, we die. This is a gamble.\n    -   **Reward:** None. (1, 4) is empty.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** Low. The Enemy is at (1, 4). It cannot reach (3, 4) in one turn.\n    -   **Obstacles:** (3, 4) is empty. Walls are far.\n    -   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the Enemy (distance 2). Opens up the center of the board.\n\n3.  **UP to (2, 5):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** Low. Enemy at (1, 4) cannot reach (2, 5) directly in one move (needs diagonal or two steps).\n    -   **Obstacles:** (2, 5) is empty.\n    -   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the Enemy. I can then access the apple at (2, 6).\n\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 3):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** Low.\n    -   **Obstacles:** (2, 3) is empty.\n    -   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the Enemy.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT vs UP:**\n-   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Moves me deeper into the board, centralizing my position. From (3, 4), I have access to the center cluster of apples ((5, 6), (6, 6), etc.) and the top-right apples ((7, 8), (8, 7)). It puts more distance between me and the Enemy immediately.\n-   **UP (2, 5):** Moves me up the left side. From (2, 5), I am close to (2, 6) and (2, 8). However, I am still relatively close to the Enemy's starting position ((1, 4)). If the Enemy moves UP to (1, 5) or (1, 6), we remain close.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (3, 4) is the most strategic move. It creates immediate separation from the Enemy at (1, 4) and positions me centrally. From (3, 4), I can chase the cluster of apples at (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 2), etc. This path offers more options and higher reward potential than sticking to the left wall (UP to (2, 5)).\n\nPlan for next turn: Move towards the center (x=5,6) to collect the dense apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 6), (2, 6). Watch the Enemy at (1, 4); if it moves UP, I will be safely ahead in the center.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(1, 4)].\n*   **Apples:** Numerous apples exist. Closest ones: (4, 2), (2, 6), (2, 8), (5, 8), (5, 6), (6, 6).\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nThe enemy moved UP to (1, 5). My previous move RIGHT to (3, 4) was successful in creating distance. I am currently at (3, 4), and the enemy is at (1, 5).\n*   **Distance:** Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3. This is safe.\n*   **Enemy Intent:** The enemy is on the left edge. They likely need to turn UP again or are potentially trapped against the wall if they go LEFT. They cannot reach me immediately.\n\n**Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **LEFT (2, 4):**\n    *   **Risk:** Low. The enemy is at (1, 5). They cannot move to (2, 4) in one turn (distance 2).\n    *   **Obstacle:** None.\n    *   **Utility:** Moves me back towards the left side. This reduces my distance to apples (2, 6) and (2, 8), but puts me closer to the enemy's starting area. Less central.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (4, 4):**\n    *   **Risk:** Low. The enemy is far away.\n    *   **Obstacle:** None.\n    *   **Utility:** Moves me deeper into the center. From (4, 4), I have excellent access to the central apple cluster: (5, 6), (6, 6), (5, 8). This is the richest area on the board.\n\n3.  **UP (3, 5):**\n    *   **Risk:** Low.\n    *   **Obstacle:** None.\n    *   **Utility:** Moves me up. Good if I want to target (2, 6) or (2, 8), but might overshoot the dense central cluster slightly.\n\n4.  **DOWN (3, 3):**\n    *   **Risk:** Low. There is an apple at (7, 3), but (3, 3) is empty.\n    *   **Utility:** Moves me down towards the bottom right. This is viable but currently offers fewer immediate apple rewards than the central cluster.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe central apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 2) offers the highest point density. Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 4) positions me perfectly to enter this zone.\n*   **Path Planning:** From (4, 4), I can move UP to (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6).\n*   **Enemy Watch:** The enemy is trapped on the left wall. If they stay on the left, I dominate the center. If they try to cross to the center, they have a long path, and I will be closer to the apples.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **LEFT** keeps me near the enemy and a smaller apple group.\n*   **RIGHT** isolates me in the center with access to the largest apple group.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is the optimal strategic choice to maximize apple collection and minimize future risk by controlling the board center.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to the central apple cluster (5, 6) and (6, 6). Secure the center to prevent the enemy from reaching the high-density zones. Maintain distance from the enemy on the left wall.\n\nRIGHT",

Its previous head was (1, 5). It moved UP to eat the apple at (1, 6).\n    *   *Body:* (1, 5).\n    *   *Growth:* Since it just ate, its tail will **not** move this turn.

(4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) (Apple).\n    *   **Utility:** Decent. There is an apple at (6, 2). However, (6, 2) is close to the corner. Getting trapped in the bottom right is a risk.\n    *   **Risk:** The bottom row is a \"death zone\" eventually.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open.\n    *   **Future Potential:** (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) (Apple).\n    *   **Utility:** Good.

This is closer to (6, 2), but the bottom area is tighter.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving **UP** to (4, 5) is a strong choice. It maintains distance from the enemy on the left. It keeps options open to the left (3, 5) and up (4, 6). (4, 6) is adjacent to the dense apple cluster at (5, 6) and (6, 6). This keeps me flexible. Moving RIGHT is also viable, but UP feels more central to the board's geography, avoiding getting pinned against the right wall too early.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 5). From there, evaluate moving to (5, 6) via (4, 6) or (5, 5). Watch the enemy; if it goes to (0, 6), it is slowly dying or wasting moves. If it goes to (2, 6), I must not enter (2, 6) until it moves past or dies.\n\nUP",

Apples remain plentiful.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Enemy Analysis:** Enemy is at (2, 6).\n    *   *Reachability:* From (2, 6), the enemy can move UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), or RIGHT (3, 6).\n    *   *Collision Risk:* The enemy is at (2, 6). My head is at (4, 5).\n        *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 6), no immediate collision.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (2, 5), no immediate collision (I am at 4,5).\n        *   If the enemy moves RIGHT *and* I move UP to (4, 6), no collision.\n        *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** If the enemy moves to (3, 6) and I move to (3, 5), no collision. If the enemy moves to (3, 6) and I move to (3, 6), we collide. I am not considering moving to (3, 6) directly from (4, 5).\n        *   The closest dangerous square the enemy can reach is (3, 6). I should avoid moving into (3, 6) or putting myself in a position where I am forced to collide on the next turn.\n\n**My Moves Evaluation (from 4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open. (4, 6) is currently empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves closer to the central apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 6). Keeps me in the center. From here, I can access (5, 6), (6, 6), (3, 6), (4, 7).\n    *   **Cons:** Puts me at y=6, same row as the enemy (currently y=6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 6), and I move LEFT to (3, 6) next turn, we collide. I must be careful.\n    *   **Comparison:** This is the most aggressive move toward apples.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open. (4, 4) is currently empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Retains central position.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves away from the dense apple cluster at (5, 6). (4, 4) has no immediate apples. (4, 4) is closer to the bottom apples (6, 2), but that path is currently less populated.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open. (3, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Safe. Moves toward (2, 8).\n    *   **Cons:** Moves away from the best apples. (3, 5) is close to the enemy's current position. If the enemy moves to (3, 6) or (2, 5), I might be boxed in. (3, 5) feels like retreating.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open. (5, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward the apple cluster (5, 6).\n    *   **Cons:** Slightly less direct than UP to (4, 6) for the cluster (5,6), (6,6).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe apples at (5, 6) and (6, 6) are high priority.\nMoving **UP to (4, 6)** is the best choice. It positions me one step away from two apples.\nI must be mindful of the enemy at (2, 6). If the enemy moves to (3, 6), I must not move to (3, 6) next turn. I can move to (5, 6) or (4, 7) instead.\nMoving UP also keeps the path open to (5, 6). If I move RIGHT to (5, 5), the enemy could potentially intercept or block more easily by moving to (4, 6) or (5, 6).\nBy taking (4, 6), I secure the lane.\n*Update on Enemy:* If Enemy moves to (3, 6), I am at (4, 6). Next turn, I can move to (5, 6) (Apple) or (4, 7).\n*Update on Enemy:* If Enemy moves to (2, 5), I am safe.\n*Update on Enemy:* If Enemy moves to (1, 6) (backwards), I am safe.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 6). From there, the plan is to secure the apple at (5, 6) on the next turn, or (6, 6). I must watch the enemy's position at (2, 6). If it moves to (3, 6), I should avoid (3, 6) and aim for (5, 6) or (4, 7).\n\nUP",

Just moved UP from (4, 5).\n    *   *Note:* Because I had no body segments, I did not grow when eating an apple previously. However, I am currently on top of an apple at (4, 6) based on the board state. I will consume this apple and grow, adding a tail segment at (4, 6) for the next turn.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (2, 7), Body: [(2, 6), (1, 6)], Apples: 2.\n    *   *Analysis:* The enemy moved UP from (2, 6) to (2, 7). The board shows an apple at (2, 8). This is a critical observation. The enemy is at (2, 7), directly below (2, 8). It is highly likely the enemy will move UP to (2, 8) on this turn to eat that apple. If it does, it will grow, and its tail will not shift forward until the *following* turn (Turn 9).\n*   **Board:** 10x10. My current position (4, 6) is an apple.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is poised to eat (2, 8).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (2, 8): It will grow. The cell (2, 7) will become its new body segment (specifically, the segment connecting to the tail). The tail (1, 6) will remain occupied because the snake lengthened.\n    *   **Collision Risk:**\n        *   If the enemy moves UP (2, 7 -> 2, 8) and I move LEFT (4, 6 -> 3, 6): No collision.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP and I move RIGHT (4, 6 -> 5, 6): No collision.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP and I move DOWN (4, 6 -> 4, 5): No collision.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP and I move UP (4, 6 -> 4, 7): No collision.\n    *   The enemy's body (2, 6) and (1, 6) are currently occupied. Since the enemy is at (2, 7), the cell (2, 6) is now the neck of the snake (if we consider the head to be the moving part, the previous head becomes body). Wait, looking at the board state logic: The enemy is at (2, 7). Its body is listed as [(2, 6), (1, 6)]. This means (2, 6) is occupied by the body.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP, (2, 7) becomes occupied by its body (the segment connected to the head).\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT (2, 7 -> 1, 7): It would hit its own body (1, 6)? No, (1, 7) is empty. But (2, 8) is an apple. Snakes prefer apples.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN (2, 7 -> 2, 6): It would die instantly (head-on collision with its own body at (2, 6)). So it won't.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT (2, 7 -> 3, 7): This is possible, but less likely than going for the apple.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The enemy will almost certainly move UP to (2, 8). I must plan my move assuming the enemy eats (2, 8).\n\n**My Moves Evaluation (from 4, 6):**\nI am currently on an apple. I must eat it to grow and stay competitive. I will have a tail segment at (4, 6) next turn.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward apples at (5, 8) and (4, 9). Keeps me away from the enemy.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves away from the high-density apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 6).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 5) is empty.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreats. Moves away from the majority of apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves toward apples at (2, 8) (though the enemy will likely take it) and (5, 6).\n    *   **Cons:** Puts me directly adjacent to the enemy's potential path. If I move to (3, 6) and the enemy moves to (2, 8), we are close. If the enemy moves to (3, 7) (unlikely), I'm safe.\n    *   **Risk:** If the enemy moves UP, (2, 7) becomes its body. I would be at (3, 6). No collision.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 6) is an apple.\n    *   **Pros:** **Critical.** (5, 6) is an apple. Eating it allows me to grow immediately.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This moves me directly to the center of the apple cluster. From (5, 6), I have access to (6, 6) and (5, 8).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   If I go UP/LEFT/DOWN: I eat one apple (4, 6) and move to an empty cell.\n        *   If I go RIGHT: I eat one apple (4, 6) and *also* position myself to eat (5, 6). Wait, if I move to (5, 6), I eat the apple at (5, 6). That's a second apple (potentially).\n        *   *Correction:* The board shows apples at (4, 6) and (5, 6). Currently, my head is at (4, 6). I am eating (4, 6). If I move RIGHT to (5, 6), I will be at (5, 6). (5, 6) is an apple. I will eat (5, 6) on the same turn? No, the move happens simultaneously. I move *to* (5, 6). The apple is *at* (5, 6). I eat it. This means I eat the apple currently under my feet, and potentially the apple at the destination.\n        *   *Wait:* The rules state \"If you move onto an apple, you grow\". I am currently on an apple (4, 6). I have already \"moved onto\" it this turn (since the state update is the result of the previous move). I will eat (4, 6). If I move to (5, 6), and (5, 6) is an apple, I eat (5, 6) *next* turn? No. The board state is static for this decision.\n        *   *Reality:* My head is at (4, 6). The board shows an apple at (4, 6). I eat it. My next move takes me to a new square. If that square is (5, 6), and the board shows an apple at (5, 6), I eat that apple too.\n        *   *Wait:* The board state is the state *after* my last move. So (4, 6) is my head. The apple list includes (4, 6)? The board display shows \"1 A\" at (4, 6). Yes, there is an apple there.\n        *   The apple list provided at the top is the static list of apples for this turn.\n        *   Apples: (5, 8), (4, 2), (0, 9), (6, 2), (0, 7), (8, 7), (5, 6), (2, 8), (6, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (7, 9), (7, 3), (9, 7), (6, 1).\n        *   Notice: (4, 6) is *NOT* in the apple list at the top.\n        *   Wait, the board state \"Board state:\" shows \"6 . T T . 1 A A . . .\" for row 6.\n        *   Row 6 is y=6.\n        *   Columns 0-9.\n        *   (0,6) .\n        *   (1,6) T (Enemy tail/body)\n        *   (2,6) T (Enemy tail/body)\n        *   (3,6) .\n        *   (4,6) 1 (My head)\n        *   (5,6) A (Apple)\n        *   (6,6) A (Apple)\n        *   (7,6) .\n        *   (8,6) .\n        *   (9,6) .\n        *   So (4, 6) is empty of apples in the board state. The \"1\" represents me.\n        *   Why did the rationale say I am on an apple?\n        *   \"I am currently on top of an apple at (4, 6) based on the board state.\" - Previous Rationale.\n        *   Let's look at the board state again carefully.\n        *   Row 6: \"6 . T T . 1 A A . . .\"\n        *   (4,6) is '1'.\n        *   (5,6) is 'A'.\n        *   (6,6) is 'A'.\n        *   The apple list: (5, 6) and (6, 6) are in the list.\n        *   (4, 6) is *not* in the apple list.\n        *   So, (4, 6) is NOT an apple. My previous assumption was wrong.\n        *   I need to re-evaluate my move based on the fact that I am at (4, 6) and (4, 6) is empty (except for me).\n        *   The apples are at (5, 6) and (6, 6).\n        *   I am at (4, 6).\n        *   Target: (5, 6) or (6, 6).\n\n**Revised Moves Evaluation (from 4, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Pros: Safe distance from enemy.\n    *   Cons: No apple immediate access. (5, 8) is reachable eventually.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the best apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Cons: Moves towards (2, 6) (occupied by enemy body). If enemy moves UP (2, 7 -> 2, 8), its body moves to (2, 7). (2, 6) becomes free? No, (2, 6) is currently occupied by the body segment (2, 6). The body is [(2, 6), (1, 6)]. The head is (2, 7). If it moves UP, (2, 7) becomes body, (2, 6) remains body, (1, 6) remains body. The tail (1, 6) stays because it grew at (2, 8).\n    *   (3, 6) is safe to move to.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 6) is an apple. It is empty of snakes.\n    *   **Pros:** **High Priority.** I eat an apple. I grow. I am now one step away from (6, 6). From (5, 6), I have a good central position.\n    *   **Comparison:** Eating an apple is vital. The enemy has 2 apples, I have 0. I need to close the gap.\n    *   **Enemy Context:** The enemy is at (2, 7). It is likely going to (2, 8). This is far from me. I am safe to take the apple at (5, 6).\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 6), I can go to (6, 6) (Apple) or (5, 7) or (4, 6) (My future tail).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe enemy is distracted by the apple at (2, 8). The apples at (5, 6) and (6, 6) are mine for the taking. Moving RIGHT to (5, 6) allows me to eat an apple immediately and position myself for another apple next turn.\n\nPlan:\n1.  Move RIGHT to (5, 6). Eat apple. Grow.\n2.  Next turn (Turn 9), move to (6, 6) to eat the next apple. Or (4, 6) if blocked.\n3.  Watch the enemy. It will likely be at (2, 8). It will grow. It will be length 4. Its tail (1, 6) will remain occupied for Turn 9.\n4.  I will be at (5, 6). Distance from enemy is safe.\n\nSafety Check:\n- (5, 6) is not off board.\n- (5, 6) is not my body (I have none).\n- (5, 6) is not enemy body (Enemy is at (2, 7), body at (2, 6), (1, 6)).\n- (5, 6) is not (2, 7) (Enemy Head). It is not adjacent? (5,6) is far from (2,7).\n- Head-on collision: Enemy at (2,7), me at (4,6). No overlap.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The enemy is far away. No immediate collision risk.\n*   **Board:** Apples at (6, 6), (5, 8), (6, 2), (0, 9), (0, 7), (8, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (7, 9), (7, 3), (9, 7), (6, 1), (9, 6).\n\n**My Moves Evaluation (from 5, 6):**\nI have just eaten the apple at (5, 6).

If I move here, I die.\n    *   **Decision:** **INVALID**. Moving backwards into your own body kills you.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 6) is an apple. It is empty of snakes.\n    *   **Pros:** **High Priority.** Eating this apple allows me to grow again immediately. This puts me on a streak.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** From (6, 6), I have access to (6, 7), (7, 6), (6, 5), and (5, 6) (my future tail).\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Going UP to (5, 7) positions me for (5, 8) (next turn).\n        *   Going RIGHT to (6, 6) scores a point *now* and positions me for (6, 7), (7, 6), or (9, 6) eventually.\n        *   Since I am currently at (5, 6) and eating (5, 6), my score is increasing. Securing a second consecutive apple is a strong lead.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe enemy is in the corner. I am in the center. I have a safe apple at (6, 6). Taking it is the most aggressive and rewarding move. It extends my length and keeps me mobile.\nIf I take (6, 6), my body will be [(5, 6), (4, 6)] (or rather, I will be at (6, 6), tail at (5, 6) next turn).\nNext turn, from (6, 6), I can target (6, 7) (Apple) or (7, 6) (Empty) or (6, 5) (Apple? No, (6, 2) is far, (6, 1) is far).\nWait, looking at the list: (6, 2) and (6, 1) are apples. (6, 6) is an apple. (6, 7) is empty. (7, 6) is empty.\nBut (5, 8) is an apple. (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 8) is a path.\nActually, from (6, 6), going RIGHT to (7, 6) is a possibility. (8, 7) and (9, 6) are apples in that direction.\nLet's stick to the immediate apple at (6, 6).\n\nSafety Check:\n- (6, 6) is on the board.\n- (6, 6) is not my body (I am at 5,6; tail at 4,6).\n- (6, 6) is not enemy body (Enemy is at 2,8).\n- (6, 6) is not enemy head (Enemy is at 2,8).\n- No head-on collision risk (Enemy is far).\n\nDecision: RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving up puts me closer to (5, 8) and (7, 8).\n    *   **Body:** My body is at (5,6) and (4,6). (6,7) is safe.\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is at (3,8). Distance is large.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 5) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Safe.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves away from the cluster of apples at the top.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 6) is my own body (the neck).\n    *   **Decision:** **INVALID**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up access to (8, 7), (9, 6), (9, 7).\n    *   **Cons:** Misses the apple at (6, 7).\n\nComparison:\nTargeting (6, 7) seems optimal. It is an immediate point and keeps me in the center/top area.\nFrom (6, 7), I can access (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 7), (6, 6).\n(6, 6) will be my body next turn (since I'm moving from 6,6 to 6,7, 6,6 becomes part of the body).\n(6, 8) is empty.\n(5, 8) is an apple.\n(7, 7) is empty.\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nBoard state:\n 9 A . . . . . .

No, let's read carefully.\nRow 8: `. . T 0 . A . A . .`\nRow 7: `A . T . . . A . A A`\nRow 6: `. . T . T T 1 . . A`\n\nThe \"T\"s are the enemy body.\nEnemy Head: 0 at (3,8).\nEnemy Body: T at (2,8), T at (2,7), T at (2,6).\nMy Head: 1 at (6,6).\nMy Body: The prompt says \"Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6)]\".\nRow 6 shows `. . T . T T 1 . . A`.\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo:\nIndex 2 is T (Enemy body).\nIndex 4 is T? Wait, `(4, 6)` is my body. Row 6, Index 4 is `.`.\n`(5, 6)` is my body. Row 6, Index 5 is `T`.\nWait, the prompt says: \"Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6)]\".\nBut the board state visualization shows \"T\" at index 2, index 4, index 5?

T . . . A . A A`\nX=6: `A`.\n(6, 7) is an apple. It is safe.\n(7, 6) is empty (Row 6, X=7 is `.`).\n(6, 5) is empty (Row 5 is all `. . . . . . . . . .`).\n\nDecision:\nUP to (6, 7) is the best move. It is an apple.\nThe enemy is at (3, 8). They are heading roughly towards (5, 8), (7, 8).\nIf I go UP to (6, 7), I am below (6, 8).\nNext turn, from (6, 7), I can go to (5, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8).\n(5, 8) is an apple. (7, 8) is an apple.\nThis sets up a potential conflict with the enemy at (3, 8) if they go RIGHT to (4, 8) and then (5, 8).\nBut for now, (6, 7) is safe and productive.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is at (3,8). Their body is at (2,8), (2,7), (2,6).\nIf I go UP to (6,7), I am safe.\nThe enemy might move to (4,8) or (3,9).\nIf they move to (4,8), they are getting closer to (5,8).\nIf they move to (5,8) eventually, I might want to intercept or avoid collision.\nBut I will be at (6,7).\nIf I take (6,7) now, next turn I can go to (5,8) or (7,8).\n(5,8) is closer to the enemy (3,8 -> 4,8 -> 5,8).\n(7,8) is further.\nIf I go (6,7) -> (5,8), I risk running into the enemy if they are at (4,8) moving to (5,8).\nHowever, the enemy is at (3,8). They would need two turns to reach (5,8) via (4,8).\nI can reach (5,8) in one turn (from 6,7).\nSo I should be able to eat (5,8) before the enemy gets there, unless the enemy is already closer than I think.\nDistance from Enemy (3,8) to (5,8): 2 moves (Right, Right).\nDistance from Me (6,6) to (5,8): 3 moves (Up, Up, Left).\nWait, I am at (6,6). (5,8) is at X=5, Y=8.\nDistance is |6-5| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nThe enemy is at (3,8). Distance is |3-5| + |8-8| = 2.\nThe enemy is closer to (5,8) than I am.\nSo if I go for (5,8) next, the enemy might get there first or we might collide.\nHowever, I am at (6,6). (6,7) is an apple.\n(7,8) is an apple.\nDistance from Me (6,6) to (7,8): |6-7| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nDistance from Enemy (3,8) to (7,8): |3-7| + |8-8| = 4.\nI am closer to (7,8) than the enemy is.\nSo targeting (7,8) seems safer.\nBut (6,7) is on the way to (7,8)? No, (6,7) is to the left of the path (6,6)->(7,6)->(7,7)->(7,8).\n(6,7) is Up.\n(7,8) is Up-Right.\nFrom (6,7), I can go to (7,7) (Right) or (6,8) (Up) or (7,8) (Up-Right? No, diagonal not allowed).\nSo (6,7) -> (7,7) -> (7,8).\n(6,7) -> (6,8) -> (7,8).\n(6,7) -> (7,7) -> (7,8) is 2 moves.\n(6,6) -> (6,7) -> (7,7) -> (7,8) is 3 moves.\nDistance from Enemy (3,8) to (7,8) is 4.\nSo I am much safer targeting (7,8).\nHowever, (6,7) is an apple. I should eat it.\nIs there any danger in eating (6,7)?\nEnemy is at (3,8).\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (4,8), they are far.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (3,9), they are in corner.\nNo immediate collision risk.\n\nWait, looking at the apples again.\nApples: (5, 8), (4, 2), (0, 9), (6, 2), (0, 7), (8, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (7, 9), (7, 3), (9, 7), (6, 1), (6, 7), (9, 6), (4, 4)\n(6, 7) is an apple.\n(8, 7) is an apple.\n(9, 6) is an apple.\nThese are all to the right/up of my position.\n(4, 4) is to the left/down.\nI am in a good position for the top-right apples.\nThe enemy is in the top-left.\nThey are competing for (5, 8), (0, 9), (0, 7), (4, 4).\nI am competing for (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 6), (9, 7).\nWe are in different quadrants mostly.\n(5, 8) is the overlap point.\nBut (6, 7) is safely mine.\n\nMoving UP to (6, 7) is the correct play.\n\nDouble check safety:\n- (6, 7) is on board.\n- (6, 7) is not my body (My body: 5,6; 4,6).\n- (6, 7) is not enemy body (Enemy body: 2,8; 2,7; 2,6).\n- (6, 7) is not enemy head (Enemy head: 3,8).\n- No head-on collision risk if enemy moves to (6, 7)? Enemy is at (3,8). Impossible.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nLong-term plan:\nEat (6,7). Next turn, move towards (7,8) or (8,7) to secure the cluster of apples on the right side. Avoid the left side where the enemy is heading. If the enemy moves aggressively to the center (e.g., to 4,8), be prepared to defend or cut them off, but currently, I have a lead (2 apples vs 3, but I just ate one so I'm at 3, and I'm about to eat another to reach 4). I need to maintain this momentum.\n\nWait, I need to be careful.\nMy current score: 2.\nI ate an apple at Turn 9 (5,6). Score becomes 3.\nI am moving to (6,7) which is an apple. Score becomes 4.\nEnemy score: 3.\nI will be leading 4-3.\n\nUP",

A` -> Index 7 is `.`).\n(7,8) is an apple (Row 8: Index 7 is `A`).\n\nSo (7,7) is safe.\nIt opens up (8,7) (Apple), (7,8) (Apple), (9,6) (Apple).\nIt moves away from the enemy (4,8).\n\nWhat about UP to (6,8)?\n(6,8) is safe.\nFrom (6,8), I can go to (7,8) (Apple) or (5,8) (Apple).\nBut Enemy is at (4,8). If Enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8), I am at (6,8).\nIf I am at (6,8) and Enemy is at (5,8), I am safe.\nIf I am at (6,8) and Enemy is at (5,8), I can eat (7,8) or (6,9) or (5,8) if they miss (but they won't miss from distance 1).\nSo (6,8) is a valid defensive position.\n\nHowever, (7,7) seems more aggressive for the apples on the right.\n(7,7) -> (8,7) (Apple). (8,7) is safe from enemy (distance 4).\n(7,7) -> (7,8) (Apple).\n(7,7) -> (9,6) is two moves away.\n\nLet's look at the board layout for the right side.\nRow 7: `A . T . . . A . A A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nApples at 0, 6, 8, 9.\n(7,7) is at 7.\n(8,7) is at 8 (Apple).\n(9,7) is at 9 (Apple).\n(7,8) is at (7,8) (Apple).\n(9,6) is at (9,6) (Apple).\n\nGoing RIGHT to (7,7) seems best to secure the cluster.\n\nWait, let's check if there is any trap.\nIf I go to (7,7), my body follows.\nMy body currently ends at (4,6).\nNext turn, I will be at (7,7), body (6,7), (6,6), (5,6).\nThis is a safe tail.\n\nWhat if I go UP to (6,8)?\nMy body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6).\nFuture: (6,8), (6,7), (6,6).\nAlso safe.\n\nComparison:\nIf I go UP (6,8):\n- Threaten (5,8) and (7,8).\n- Enemy is at (4,8). They will likely go to (5,8) or (4,9).\n- If they go (5,8), I can go to (7,8) or (6,9).\n- (6,9) is top wall. (6,8) -> (6,9) -> Dead end potential if not careful.\n- (7,8) is open.\n\nIf I go RIGHT (7,7):\n- Threaten (8,7) and (7,8).\n- Enemy is far away.\n- More space to maneuver.\n\nThe right side has more apples and more space.\n(7,7) is the move.\n\nOne check: (7,7) is empty?\nBoard visual:\nRow 7: `A . T . . . A . A A`\n(7,7) is index 7.\nIndex 6 is `A`.\nIndex 7 is `.`\nIndex 8 is `A`.\nSo (7,7) is empty.\n\nCheck if (7,7) is a trap?\n(8,7) is Apple.\n(7,8) is Apple.\n(6,7) is my current head (will be body).\n(7,6) is empty (Row 6: `. . T . T T 1 . . A` -> Index 7 is `.`).\nSo (7,7) is surrounded by empty space/apples, not walls or my body.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nSecure the right-side apples. The enemy is occupied on the left/top-left. I have a clear path to (8,7), (9,6), (9,7). I should avoid (5,8) unless I can trap the enemy or steal it safely. I have the lead if I just ate (score 4 vs 3), so survival and steady growth is key.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is at (4,8). If they go RIGHT to (5,8), they will eat an apple. Score becomes 4. I will be at (7,7) with score 4. Tie.\nIf I eat (8,7) or (7,8) next, I pull ahead.\nSeems good.\n\nWait, let's double check the apple count.\nIf I ate (6,7) (Turn 10), my score is 4.\nIf I eat another apple soon, score 5.\nEnemy score is 3.\nWait, the prompt says \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 3\".\nIf the prompt is correct and I haven't eaten yet, then (6,7) wasn't an apple?\nBut the \"Last Rationale\" (Turn 10) listed (6,7) as an apple.\nAnd \"Apples at\" for Turn 10 (in Last Rationale) included (6,7).\nAnd \"Apples at\" for Turn 11 (Current) does NOT include (6,7).\nSo I definitely ate it.\nI will assume my score is 4.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nSnake #0 - Head: (4, 8), Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)].\nRow 8: `. . T 0 . A . A . .`\n(3,8) is Head (0).\n(2,8) is Body (T).\n(4,8) is Head (0) in the text description, but Row 8 shows 0 at index 3?\nWait.\nText: \"Head: (4, 8)\"\nVisual: Row 8: `. . T 0 . A . A . .` -> 0 is at index 3 (X=3).\nSo Head is at (3,8)?\nIf the text says (4,8) and visual says (3,8), I should trust the text description \"Head: (4, 8)\" as the primary game state, but the visual is the map.\nIf the visual 0 is at index 3, and X=0..9, then 0 is at (3,8).\nWhy does text say (4,8)?\nMaybe the visual is shifted?\n`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`0: .`\n`1: .`\n`2: T`\n`3: 0`\n`4: .`\n`5: A`\nSo (3,8) is 0.\nIf the text says (4,8), maybe the visual is slightly off or I should prioritize the text.\nHowever, the visual map is usually the ground truth for positions.\nIf the visual says (3,8) and text says (4,8), it's a conflict.\nBut wait, if the enemy is at (4,8), then the apple at (5,8) is 1 step away.\nIf the enemy is at (3,8), the apple at (5,8) is 2 steps away.\nMy distance to (5,8) is 2.\nIf enemy is at (4,8), they win the race.\nIf enemy is at (3,8), we tie (both 2 steps).\nGiven the visual explicitly puts 0 at index 3, I will trust the visual.\nSo Enemy is at (3,8).\nIf Enemy is at (3,8), they are further away.\nThis makes UP to (6,8) even safer regarding (5,8).\nBut RIGHT to (7,7) is still better for the overall board control.\n\nI will stick with RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

The snake is moving horizontally.\n-   **UP (7, 8):** Secures an apple immediately. (7, 8) is further up the board. From (7, 8), I can access (7, 9) or (8, 8).\n-   **DOWN (7, 6):** No immediate reward. Pushes me back toward the bottom where there are apples (6, 2), but (6, 6) blocks direct descent.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe most immediate reward is eating an apple.\nIs (8, 7) safer than (7, 8)?\nThe enemy is at (5, 8).\n(7, 8) is closer to (5, 8) than (8, 7) is.\n(8, 7) is 3 steps away from (5, 8) (Manhattan).\n(7, 8) is 2 steps away.\n(8, 7) is also closer to the wall (9, 7) and (8, 7) itself is on the 8-column.\nHowever, (8, 7) offers a nice path along the top-right edge to (9, 7) or (8, 8).\n(7, 8) puts me directly above my current position, keeping me in the center somewhat.\nVisually, (8, 7) seems to open up the right side cleanly.\nLet's check (8, 7) specifically.\nNext move options from (8, 7):\n-   RIGHT: (9, 7) (Apple)\n-   LEFT: (7, 7) (Body)\n-   UP: (8, 8) (Empty)\n-   DOWN: (8, 6) (Empty)\nSo 3 safe moves from (8, 7).\nFrom (7, 8):\n-   RIGHT: (8, 8) (Empty)\n-   LEFT: (6, 8) (Empty)\n-   UP: (7, 9) (Apple)\n-   DOWN: (7, 7) (Body)\nSo 3 safe moves from (7, 8).\nBoth are good.\nHowever, (8, 7) is closer to the wall and allows me to snake along the right edge. (7, 8) is more central.\nGiven the enemy is on the left/center, moving to the right edge (8, 7) is a good defensive separation.\nAlso, eating at (8, 7) means my tail (which is at (5, 6)) moves to (6, 6). This frees up (5, 6).\nThe enemy is at (5, 8). They are far from my tail.\n\nI will choose **RIGHT** to (8, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (8, 7). In the next turn, move to (9, 7) to eat that apple. This clears the top-right corner. From there, I can decide whether to loop down or continue horizontally. I must keep an eye on the enemy's movement to ensure they don't box me in, but they are currently on the opposite side.\n\nRIGHT",

However, this puts me adjacent (diagonally) to the enemy head at (7,7). If I go toward (7,8) next turn I risk a contest with the enemy (they can take 7,8 by moving UP this turn or next). Moving right is more aggressive and increases the chance of a head-to-head contest for 7,8.\n- DOWN -> (5,7): legal.

It preserves more escape options (left/right/down) and avoids getting stuck on the top edge.\n\nEnemy move constraints: from (7,7) they cannot move LEFT into (6,7) because that's their own body.

(8, 8) is empty. (8, 6) is empty.\n  - Enemy adjacency: (5, 6) is empty (currently occupied by my tail, but I am moving, so it will be vacated). (4, 7) is an apple. (6, 7) is currently my body (neck), but will be vacated if I move right.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    -   **Safety:** (9, 7) is an apple.\n    -   My body is at (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6). (9, 7) is distinct.\n    -   **Risk:** The Enemy is at (5, 7). They are moving. If they move RIGHT to (6, 7), (6, 7) is currently my body. If they move into my body, they die. If they move into my neck, they die.\n    -   However, I must consider head-on collision. If Enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7) and I move LEFT to (7, 7), we collide? No, I am moving RIGHT. Enemy moving to (6, 7) is 3 steps away from my head (8, 7).\n    -   **Outcome:** I eat an apple. I grow. My new head is (9, 7). My body becomes (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6).\n    -   **Future:** From (9, 7), I am at the right wall. My only options are LEFT (8, 7 - body), DOWN (9, 6 - Apple), UP (9, 8 - Empty). I will have 2 safe moves (Down/Up).\n\n2.  **UP to (8, 8):**\n    -   **Safety:** (8, 8) is empty.\n    -   My body is at (7, 7)... (5, 6). (8, 8) is distinct.\n    -   **Risk:** Low.\n    -   **Outcome:** No apple. New head (8, 8). Body (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6).\n    -   **Future:** Access to (8, 9), (9, 8), (7, 8), (8, 7). (8, 7) will be my body (neck) next turn.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 6):**\n    -   **Safety:** (8, 6) is empty.\n    -   **Risk:** Low.\n    -   **Outcome:** No apple. New head (8, 6). Body (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6).\n    -   **Future:** Access to (8, 5), (9, 6), (7, 6), (8, 7). (8, 7) will be body.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 7):**\n    -   **Safety:** (7, 7) is my neck.\n    -   **Risk:** Immediate death. Invalid.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Secures an apple immediately. Forces me into the corner at (9, 7). From (9, 7), I can go DOWN to (9, 6) (Apple) or UP to (9, 8). This is a \"safe zone\" where the enemy cannot easily trap me because I have vertical movement along the right wall.\n    -   Enemy at (5, 7). They are on the opposite side of the board.\n    -   If I go RIGHT, I eat. If I go DOWN next (from 9,7), I eat (9,6). If I go UP next (from 9,7), I eat (9,6) eventually or (8,8).\n    -   The enemy is chasing apples on the left side. I am securing the right side.\n-   **UP (8, 8) / DOWN (8, 6):** Do not eat an apple immediately. While they keep me more central, the enemy is currently on the left. Securing the apple at (9, 7) is a definite point and removes a target from the board.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe goal is to outlast and outwit. Securing the apple at (9, 7) is a guaranteed point. While it puts me in a corner, the enemy is far away (distance 4 Manhattan). From (9, 7), I can loop down along the right wall (9, 6 -> 8, 6 -> 7, 6 -> ...). The apples at (9, 7) and (9, 6) are clustered, offering a safe \"detour\" to gain points while the enemy handles the more dangerous center/left cluster. Taking the point now is the highest value move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (9, 7). Next turn, move DOWN to (9, 6) to eat that apple as well. This will put me at (9, 6) with a vertical path up the right side (9, 5, 9, 4...) or back towards the center. I will avoid the enemy who is currently on the left side (x=5).\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4,7) with a body stretching to the left and up.\n\n**Analysis of Moves:**\n1.  **LEFT to (8,7):** This is my current neck and part of my body. Moving here would result in immediate death. **Eliminated.**\n2.  **UP to (9,8):** This cell is empty according to the board state. It is safe from immediate collision.

It is safe from immediate collision. From (9,6), I would have access to (9,5), (8,6), and (9,7) next turn.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Off the board. Immediate death. **Eliminated.**\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth UP and DOWN are valid moves. DOWN leads to an apple, providing a guaranteed point and growth. UP leads to an empty cell.\nConsidering the game state (Turn 14/150, scores are tied 5-5), securing an apple is a high priority to gain a lead. The apple at (9,6) is directly accessible. The apple at (0,9) is currently furthest from the enemy (who is at x=4) and closest to me (distance 19), making it a strategic target if I can navigate there.\nMoving DOWN to (9,6) allows me to eat and then potentially pivot towards the left side to compete for the (0,9) apple, or continue clearing the right side. Moving UP to (9,8) offers no immediate point and might delay reaching the left-side apple cluster.\nI will choose DOWN to eat the apple at (9,6).\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (9,6). From (9,6), I will likely move LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5) next.

Available Moves & Immediate Safety:**\n*   **UP (9, 7):** Occupied by my own body segment. **DEADLY**.\n*   **RIGHT:** Off the board (x=10). **DEADLY**.\n*   **LEFT (8, 6):** Currently empty (based on the visual board state and coordinates).\n*   **DOWN (9, 5):** Currently empty.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves (LEFT vs. DOWN):**\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (9, 5)**\n    *   **Immediate Gain:** There is an apple at (6, 0) and (7, 3) on the lower right.\n    *   **Future Safety:** My body is currently blocking the right edge from y=7 to y=9 (segments at (9,7) and the body stack at (8,7)...).\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy snake (ID 0) is located at x=4. It is highly unlikely to move all the way to x=9 in the next few turns to threaten the right edge immediately.\n    *   **Pathfinding:** From (9, 5), I can move DOWN to (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> ... -> (9, 0). This clears the right edge, creating a \"safe\" corridor for my tail to grow into. My tail will eventually retract from (5, 6) to (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (9, 7). Clearing the cells from y=0 to y=6 on the right edge ensures that when my tail finally reaches (9, 7), the cells below it are open for my body to follow without trapping me.\n    *   **Apple Access:** From the bottom right (y=0 to y=2), I have access to apples (6,0), (7,3), (8,1), (6,1). The closest cluster is on the bottom row (6,0) and the one above (6,1). I can sweep the right side of the board.\n\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (8, 6)**\n    *   **Immediate Gain:** No apple.\n    *   **Future Safety:** I would be entering the \"center\" of the board. My body is currently forming a barrier at y=7 (from x=6 to x=9) and at y=6 (x=5 to x=6).\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (4, 6). If I move to (8, 6) and they move East (to 5, 6), we are safe. However, if they move Northeast or East later, we might meet.\n    *   **Trapping Risk:** The center of the board is more crowded. By moving LEFT, I reduce the open space around me. My body at (9,7) and (8,7) blocks the top. If I go into the center, I risk being surrounded by my own body or the enemy.\n    *   **Apple Access:** Apples in the center are scarce compared to the left or right edges. The nearest apple to (8,6) is (7,8) or (7,3). (7,8) is risky as it is near my current body and the top wall.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy & Survival:**\nThe goal is to survive and grow.\n*   **The \"Right Sweep\" Strategy:** By moving DOWN, I start a sweep of the right side of the board (x=8, 9). This clears the path for my tail. Since my tail is currently at (5, 6), and the next segments are (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), moving DOWN opens up the lower right quadrant (y=0..5).\n*   **Apple Clusters:** The right side has apples at (6,0), (6,1), (7,3), (8,1). The left side has a massive cluster, but it is currently occupied by the enemy snake (ID 0) who is at (4,6) and heading left/up. Engaging the enemy on the left side (near (0,9)) for apples is a high-risk move (head-on collision potential).\n*   **Safety Calculation:** The right side is currently empty of enemies. By clearing the bottom of the board, I ensure my tail has space to grow into. If I move LEFT into the center, I risk cutting off my own escape routes. My current body configuration is an \"L\" shape or a hooked line. If I turn left now, I create a loop that I might not be able to exit if the enemy pushes me or if I move too far.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** allows me to clear the right edge, secure the apple at (6,0) or (6,1) shortly, and creates a safe buffer zone for my tail. Moving LEFT risks congestion and a head-on collision with the enemy who is likely moving towards the left-side apple cluster. Survival dictates clearing space.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move DOWN to (9,5).\n2. Continue DOWN to (9,4), (9,3), etc., to clear the right edge and collect apples (6,0), (7,3).\n3. Avoid the left side until the enemy is clear or I have secured the right side.\n\nDOWN",

However, this moves me closer to the center of the board. The enemy snake is at (4,3), which is horizontally aligned with me but separated by distance. Moving left puts me into the general area where the enemy might expand or move. While the immediate cell (8,3) is empty, it reduces my isolation on the right edge.\n- **DOWN (9,2)**: Moves me deeper into the right edge. This keeps me away from the enemy snake (currently at x=4). It positions me closer to apples at (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), and (8,1). It also aligns me vertically with the apple at (7,3) (at y=3), making it accessible next turn if I move left then up, or just left. Crucially, moving DOWN keeps my body (currently extending upwards) out of my immediate path and maintains space. My tail is at (7,7), so moving down creates a gap that allows my body to flow towards the bottom right, reducing the risk of trapping myself against the top edge.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the \"conservative approach\" from the previous turn and the desire to secure the right side apples, **DOWN** is the safer choice. It avoids moving towards the enemy's territory (left/center) and utilizes the open space on the right edge (y=0 to y=2). The apple at (7,3) remains reachable in subsequent turns without rushing into the center.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nSecure the apples on the right edge (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (8,1). Avoid the center until the right side is cleared or the enemy moves away. Monitor the enemy's movement to ensure they don't cut off access to the center.\n\nDOWN",

Approaches the apple at (6, 2). However, this moves me closer to the enemy (currently at x=4). The enemy is also at y=2. If I move left to (8, 2) and the enemy moves right to (5, 2), we remain aligned on the same row. This risks cutting off my escape routes and forces me into a confrontation zone.\n    *   **DOWN (9, 1):**\n        *   **Status:** Empty on the board state.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me deeper into the right edge (y=1).\n        *   **Apples:** The apple at (8, 1) is now adjacent (distance 1). The apple at (6, 1) is distance 2. The apple at (6, 0) is distance 2.\n        *   **Safety:** Staying on the right edge keeps the board wall as a barrier on my right side, effectively reducing the directions I can be attacked from to 3 (Left, Up, Down) instead of 4. It also keeps me away from the enemy's current position (x=4 vs x=9).\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 2). If I move **LEFT**, I enter the central channel where the enemy operates. The enemy has a long body and is likely to move towards apples or expand. Confronting it in the center is risky.\n    *   The **DOWN** move (9, 1) secures the bottom-right corner. The board diagram shows an apple at (6, 1) and (6, 0). Moving down positions me to collect (8, 1) next, then (6, 1), then (6, 0). This is a safe, high-reward path.\n    *   **Safety of DOWN:** The cell (9, 1) is empty. My body is behind me at (9, 3) and to the left at (8, 7). There are no obstacles.\n\n5.  **Final Choice:** **DOWN**. It is the only safe direction that maintains distance from the enemy and secures the accessible apples on the right flank.\n\nDOWN",

This matches the board state which shows `1` at (9, 1).\n    *   **My Body:** The previous body was [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. Since I grew at (9, 1) (confirmed by the board showing an apple there previously), my tail (9, 7) stays. My new body is [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)].\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (3, 2). Body: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)].\n    *   **Apples:**\n        *   (9, 1): Just eaten by me.\n        *   (8, 1): Available.\n        *   (6, 1): Available.\n        *   (0, 9), (6, 2), etc. (Distant).\n\n2.  **Immediate Threat Assessment (Simultaneous Moves):**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (3, 2).\n        *   **Distances:** To my head (9, 1): dx = 6, dy = 1. Manhattan distance = 7.\n        *   **Potential Moves:** The enemy is likely to move towards apples on the left/top. It is currently at y=2. It has apples at (6, 2) and (5, 4) nearby.\n        *   **Collision Risk:** It is physically impossible for the enemy to reach (9, 1) or (8, 1) or (10, 1) in one turn. The enemy is 6 steps away horizontally. Even if the enemy moves Right and I move Right, we will not collide. We are safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Moves from (9, 1):**\n    *   **UP (9, 2):**\n        *   **Status:** Occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head).\n        *   **Verdict:** **INVALID (DEATH).**\n    *   **RIGHT (10, 1):**\n        *   **Status:** Outside the board (x=10 > 9).\n        *   **Verdict:** **INVALID (DEATH).**\n    *   **LEFT (8, 1):**\n        *   **Status:** Contains an apple `(8, 1)` (visible on the board map at row 1, col 8).\n        *   **Safety:** Empty. No enemy body parts here. Enemy is at x=3.\n        *   **Result:** I eat the apple. I grow.\n        *   **Future:** From (8, 1), I can easily access (7, 1) or (8, 0) or (8, 2).\n    *   **DOWN (9, 0):**\n        *   **Status:** Contains an apple `(0, 0)`? No, wait. The board shows `A` at (0, 0). At (9, 0), the board shows `.` (empty).\n        *   **Safety:** Empty.\n        *   **Result:** Move to (9, 0). No apple.\n        *   **Future:** From (9, 0), I am pinned against the bottom-right corner. My only safe moves would be UP or LEFT. Moving DOWN or RIGHT kills me.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Apple Priority:** My score is 6. Enemy is 8. I need apples. (8, 1) is right next to me.\n    *   **Safety & Board Control:**\n        *   **Option LEFT (8, 1):** Moves toward the center of the board, securing an apple immediately. It opens up the route to (7, 1) and (6, 1).\n        *   **Option DOWN (9, 0):** Moves away from the apple at (8, 1) and traps me in the corner.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is moving simultaneously. Even if the enemy moves towards me (unlikely, as apples are elsewhere), the minimum distance to my new head (8, 1) is 5 (e.g., from 3,2 to 8,1). I am safe.\n    *   **Trapping:** Moving DOWN to (9, 0) is a suboptimal corner move. Moving LEFT to (8, 1) keeps the wall to my right (safe side) and moves me toward the cluster of apples at (8, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   **LEFT** is the only move that yields an apple this turn.\n    *   **DOWN** is safe but wastes a turn and risks trapping myself.\n    *   **UP/RIGHT** are death.\n\nChoosing **LEFT** is the optimal play for score and safety.\n\nLEFT",

This is a good directional move.\n\n4.  **DOWN (8, 0):**\n    *   **Status:** Row 0: `0 A . . . . A A . . .`\n    *   (8, 0) is column 8, row 0. The map shows `.`.

(9, 0) is empty.\n\n**Decision Making:**\nI need to catch up to the enemy (8 apples vs 7).\n*   **UP (8, 2):** No immediate apple.\n*   **DOWN (8, 0):** No immediate apple.\n*   **LEFT (7, 1):** No immediate apple, but leads to apples at (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 3).\n*   **RIGHT (9, 1):** Death.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of LEFT vs UP vs DOWN:**\n*   **Target Cluster:** Apples are located at (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 3).\n*   **Direction to Cluster:** The cluster is mostly to the Left and Down.\n    *   (7, 1) is to the Left.\n    *   (8, 0) is Down.\n*   **Safety:**\n    *   **Left (7, 1):** Moves towards (6, 1) (Apple). However, (6, 1) is directly below the enemy body? No, Enemy is at x=2-5. (6, 1) is safe. Moving Left puts my tail at (9, 1). The space (9, 1) will be empty (tail moves forward). My body is along x=9.\n    *   **Down (8, 0):** Moves towards (7, 0) (Apple). (8, 0) is at the bottom edge. My body is along x=9. If I go Down, I move parallel to my body. If I go Down again, I hit the wall. If I go Left from (8, 0), I get to (7, 0) (Apple). If I go Up from (8, 0), I return to (8, 1).\n\n**Comparison:**\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe.\n*   **LEFT (7, 1):** Leaves me at (7, 1). I can then go DOWN to (7, 0) (Apple) or LEFT to (6, 1) (Apple). This opens up the board nicely.\n*   **DOWN (8, 0):** Leaves me at (8, 0). I can then go LEFT to (7, 0) (Apple). I am closer to the bottom edge.\n\n**Why LEFT?**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 1) keeps me away from the immediate bottom edge (y=0) which can be a trap. From (7, 1), I have access to (6, 1), (7, 0), and (8, 1). It is a central pivot point.\nFrom (8, 0), I am pinned against the bottom wall.\nFurthermore, the enemy is at (2, 2). Moving Left brings me slightly closer to the enemy's potential path (if he goes for apples at (5, 4) or (6, 2)), but I am still 5 steps away Manhattan distance. It is safe.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move **LEFT** to (7, 1).\n2.  On the next turn, look to move to (6, 1) or (7, 0) to eat an apple and gain a point.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction:**\nSnake #0 is at (2, 2). Apples are at (5, 4), (6, 2), (2, 9).\nHe is likely to move UP to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 2) (occupied by his body? No, body is (3, 2). He cannot move into his body). He must move UP, LEFT, or DOWN.\n*   (2, 1) is empty.\n*   (2, 3) is empty.\n*   (1, 2) is empty.\nMost likely he will move UP towards (2, 9) or RIGHT (if he has a path, but (3,2) is body). Actually, looking at the map, (2, 2) is `0`. (3, 2) is `T`. (4, 2) is `T`.\nWait, the enemy body is listed as `[(3, 2), (4, 2), ...]`.\nSo the cell to the RIGHT of his head (3, 2) is occupied by his own body. He cannot move RIGHT.\nHe can move UP to (2, 3), LEFT to (1, 2), or DOWN to (2, 1).\nIf he moves UP, he gets closer to apples at (2, 9).\nIf he moves DOWN, he gets closer to apples at (6, 1)? No, (6, 1) is far.\nHe will likely go UP or try to navigate to the right side apples (6, 2).\nRegardless, he is far away.\n\nMy move LEFT is safe.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Move LEFT: (8, 1) -> (7, 1).\n- Check boundaries: x=7 is within [0, 9].\n- Check self collision: (7, 1) is not in my body list [(9, 1), (9, 2), ...].\n- Check enemy collision: Enemy is at x=2. (7, 1) is safe.\n\nOne specific concern: The enemy snake body extends to (5, 7). My body is at x=9. We are on opposite sides of the board. Safe.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

However, (7, 1) becomes empty after the tail moves, but (8, 1) is occupied.\n    *   LEFT (6, 1) seems slightly better because it connects to a wider area of apples ((6,2), (5,4), etc.) compared to the corner at (7,0).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT is the best option.

Our body forms a barrier toward the center/right, so staying flexible is important to avoid getting boxed in by our own segments.\n\nShort-term plan: keep flexibility while beginning to approach the left apple cluster. Prefer moves that preserve three exits so we can choose to go top-left (toward the 0,7\u20139 apples) or down-left later depending on enemy movement and tail positions.\n\nGiven the above, UP gives the best balance of safety, future options (3 exits), and positioning to eventually sweep left/up toward apples.

Enemy body is at x=1,2,3,4. (6,3) is x=6. Safe.\n    *   Is (6,3) an apple? Looking at the list: (7,3) is an apple. (6,3) is not listed. So no apple.\n    *   Safety check: (6,3) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6,1):**\n    *   (6,1) is currently occupied by my body (specifically, the segment directly behind my head).\n    *   Moving into your own body = death.\n    *   **DEADLY MOVE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5,2):**\n    *   Is (5,2) on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is (5,2) in my body? My body is at x=6,7,8,9 and y=1-6. (5,2) has x=5. Safe.\n    *   Is (5,2) in enemy body? Enemy body x=1-4. (5,2) has x=5. Safe.\n    *   Is (5,2) an apple? Looking at the list: (5,4) and (5,0) are apples. (5,2) is not listed. No apple.\n    *   Safety check: (5,2) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,2):**\n    *   Is (7,2) on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is (7,2) in my body? My body: (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,2) is not in the list.\n    *   Is (7,2) in enemy body? Enemy body x=1-4. Safe.\n    *   Is (7,2) an apple? (7,8), (7,9), (7,3) are apples. (7,2) is not. No apple.\n    *   Safety check: (7,2) is safe.\n\n**Comparison of safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (6,3):**\n    *   Move to (6,3).\n    *   My body will be: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n    *   Future options from (6,3): UP (6,4), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3).\n    *   (7,3) is an apple.\n    *   (6,4) is empty (checked board state: row 4 has 0 at col 1, T at 2, 3, 4, A at 5, ... so (6,4) is empty).\n    *   (5,3) is empty.\n    *   This seems like a good move. It sets up a path to the apple at (7,3).\n\n*   **LEFT (5,2):**\n    *   Move to (5,2).\n    *   My body will be: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n    *   Future options from (5,2): UP (5,3), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2).\n    *   (6,2) will be my body (the old head position).\n    *   (5,3) is empty.\n    *   (4,2) is a snake body (Snake #0's body). Dangerous if the enemy moves, but currently occupied by body.\n    *   The apple at (5,4) is accessible.\n    *   However, moving LEFT puts me closer to the enemy snake #0 (currently at (1,4)). The enemy might move right towards the apple at (5,4) or (2,6) or (2,9). Being near the enemy increases risk of head-on collision or getting cut off.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7,2):**\n    *   Move to (7,2).\n    *   My body will be: [(7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n    *   Future options from (7,2): UP (7,3), LEFT (6,2) [body], RIGHT (8,2).\n    *   (7,3) is an apple!\n    *   (8,2) is empty.\n    *   This position allows me to eat the apple at (7,3) next turn.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nI have 9 apples. Enemy has 8 apples.\nApples near me:\n*   (7,3) is 1 step RIGHT then UP (or UP then RIGHT).\n*   (5,4) is a bit further.\n*   (6,0) is DOWN, but I can't go DOWN now because (6,1) is my body.\n\nLet's look at the board map again to visualize the space.\nRow 3: `. T . . T . . A . T`\n   Col 0: . (empty)\n   Col 1: T (Snake #0 body at 1,3)\n   Col 2: . (empty)\n   Col 3: . (empty)\n   Col 4: T (Snake #0 body at 4,3)\n   Col 5: . (empty)\n   Col 6: . (empty)\n   Col 7: A (Apple at 7,3)\n   Col 8: . (empty)\n   Col 9: T (Snake #0 body at 9,3? No, wait. Snake #0 body ends at (4,5). Let me re-read the input.\n   \"Snake #0 - Head: (1,4), Body: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\"\n   So Snake #0 is strictly in columns 1 through 4.\n   The 'T's on the board at columns 5-9 must be my body or empty.\n   Let's check my body: (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   Yes, the 'T's at (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1) are on row 1.\n   The 'T's at (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) are on rows 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   The board state shows:\n   Row 3: `. T . . T . . A . T`\n   (9,3) is indeed a 'T' (my body).\n   So (7,3) is an apple, surrounded by empty space (6,3) and (8,3) and (7,2) and (7,4).\n\n   Let's check (7,4) on the board map:\n   Row 4: `. 0 . . T A . . . T`\n   (7,4) is '.' (empty).\n   Let's check (6,3):\n   Row 3: `. T . . T . . A . T`\n   (6,3) is '.' (empty).\n   Let's check (8,3):\n   Row 3: `. T . . T . . A . T`\n   (8,3) is '.' (empty).\n\n   So (7,3) is a clear target.\n\n   If I move UP to (6,3):\n   Next turn I can move RIGHT to (7,3) and eat the apple.\n   \n   If I move RIGHT to (7,2):\n   Next turn I can move UP to (7,3) and eat the apple.\n   \n   If I move LEFT to (5,2):\n   Next turn I can move UP to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3), then UP to (6,4) or RIGHT to (7,4). It takes longer to get to (7,3).\n\n   Comparing (6,3) and (7,2):\n   (6,3) is safer regarding the body. My body is at (9,6), (9,5)... I am at (6,2). Moving to (6,3) extends the body vertically in the middle. My tail is at (9,6). The gap is large.\n   (7,2) is also safe. My body will be [(7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n   \n   Let's check immediate threats from the enemy.\n   Enemy head at (1,4). Body spans x=1-4.\n   Apples near enemy: (0,0), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,5), (2,6), (2,9), (3,7), (5,4), (5,0).\n   The enemy is likely to go for the cluster on the left or the apple at (1,5) or (2,6).\n   The apple at (5,4) is also somewhat accessible to the enemy (distance from (1,4) is 4 steps).\n   \n   My priority is (7,3). It is very close.\n   \n   Let's consider the board state constraints.\n   My tail is at (9,6).\n   If I go UP to (6,3), the body moves: (6,3) -> (6,2) -> ... -> (9,5). Tail becomes (9,5).\n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2), the body moves: (7,2) -> (6,2) -> ... -> (9,5). Tail becomes (9,5).\n   \n   Wait, looking at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" in the prompt, it says \"Head: (6, 2)\".\n   And \"Your last move information\" says \"UP\".\n   So I moved from (6,1) to (6,2).\n   \n   Now I am at (6,2).\n   \n   Let's look at the board again.\n   Row 2: `. T T T T . 1 . . T`\n   Wait, the board state provided is static. It shows the state *before* my last move or *after*? \"Board state:\" usually reflects the current state.\n   \"Turn: 24 / 150\"\n   \"Head: (6, 2)\"\n   The board shows `1` at (6,2).\n   The board shows `T` at (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1).\n   The board shows `T` at (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   This matches my body description.\n   \n   Enemy snake #0: Head (1,4). Body (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n   The board shows `0` at (1,4) (Row 4, Col 1).\n   The board shows `T` at (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n   Note: The board state `Row 5: . A . . T . . . . T` shows T at (4,5). This matches the body list.\n   \n   So the board state is consistent with the current turn.\n   \n   Target: (7,3).\n   Distance: 2 moves (RIGHT->UP or UP->RIGHT).\n   Is there any way the enemy can intercept?\n   Enemy is at (1,4). To reach (7,3), it needs 6 moves. No immediate threat.\n   \n   Let's look at the move UP to (6,3).\n   Next move: I can go RIGHT to (7,3) and eat the apple.\n   From (7,3), I can go to (7,4), (6,3), (8,3).\n   (7,4) is empty.\n   (8,3) is empty.\n   (6,3) will be my body (if I came from there).\n   Eating (7,3) grows me. My body will extend. The tail won't move.\n   My body: [(7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)].\n   The tail is at (9,6).\n   \n   Let's look at the move RIGHT to (7,2).\n   Next move: I can go UP to (7,3) and eat the apple.\n   From (7,3), same as above.\n   This seems equally good.\n   \n   Why choose UP over RIGHT or LEFT?\n   UP moves me to row 3. Row 3 is relatively open in columns 5-8.\n   RIGHT moves me to (7,2). Row 2 has my body at (9,2) and empty space at (5,2), (6,2) (old head), (7,2) (new head), (8,2). (5,2) is safe.\n   \n   Is there a risk of getting trapped?\n   My current position (6,2) has escape routes: (5,2), (6,3), (7,2).\n   (5,2) is open.\n   (6,3) is open.\n   (7,2) is open.\n   (6,1) is blocked by my body.\n   \n   Let's check the future apple at (7,3).\n   If I go UP to (6,3), I am ready to strike RIGHT.\n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2), I am ready to strike UP.\n   \n   Let's consider the enemy's potential move.\n   Enemy at (1,4).\n   Apples: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,5), (2,6), (2,9), (3,7), (5,4).\n   The cluster on the top left (0,7-9) is very tempting.\n   (1,5) is directly UP.\n   (0,7) is UP-LEFT-LEFT.\n   (2,6) is RIGHT-UP-UP.\n   \n   If the enemy goes UP to (1,5), it's a possible collision if I go LEFT? No, I'm at x=6.\n   If the enemy goes UP to (1,5), it eats (1,5) which is an apple.\n   \n   What if I go UP to (6,3)?\n   If the enemy goes UP to (1,5):\n   My head (6,3) is safe.\n   My body is at (6,2), (6,1)...\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2)?\n   If the enemy goes UP to (1,5):\n   My head (7,2) is safe.\n   \n   What about the apple at (5,4)?\n   It is accessible from (6,3) via (5,3)->(5,4) or (6,4)->(5,4).\n   It is accessible from (7,2) via (7,3)->(7,4)->(5,4) (too long) or (6,2)->(6,3)->(5,3)->(5,4).\n   \n   Let's check the board state for (5,4).\n   Row 4: `. 0 . . T A . . . T`\n   (5,4) is 'A'. An apple.\n   Is it safe?\n   Enemy is at (1,4).\n   If I am at (6,3), I am 2 moves away from (5,4).\n   If I am at (7,2), I am 3 moves away.\n   \n   However, (7,3) is 1 move away from (6,3) and (7,2).\n   (7,3) is a sure thing.\n   \n   Let's reconsider the board geometry.\n   My body occupies the right wall (x=9) from y=1 to y=6.\n   And the bottom row y=1 from x=6 to x=9.\n   And (6,2) and (6,1).\n   \n   If I go UP to (6,3):\n   I am at (6,3).\n   Body: (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   If I then go RIGHT to (7,3):\n   Head (7,3).\n   Body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n   Tail is (9,5).\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2):\n   Head (7,2).\n   Body: (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   If I then go UP to (7,3):\n   Head (7,3).\n   Body: (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n   Tail is (9,5).\n   \n   Both paths lead to the same body configuration after eating the apple (assuming the apple at (7,3) is eaten in both cases).\n   \n   Is there any advantage to being at (6,3) vs (7,2)?\n   At (6,3):\n   Neighbors: (6,2) [Body], (6,4) [Empty], (5,3) [Empty], (7,3) [Apple].\n   At (7,2):\n   Neighbors: (7,1) [Body], (7,3) [Apple], (6,2) [Body], (8,2) [Empty].\n   \n   At (6,3), I have 3 safe directions (assuming I eat the apple, I can't go back to (6,2) immediately if I didn't eat? No, I can move into where my body *was* if it moved. But (6,2) is my immediate predecessor in the body list).\n   Actually, if I move UP to (6,3), my body moves from (6,2) to (6,3)? No.\n   My body list updates: New head (6,3). Old head (6,2) becomes neck. Old neck (7,1)? No, wait.\n   Current body: [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)].\n   Move UP to (6,3).\n   New body: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n   (7,2) is NOT in the new body.\n   (5,3) is NOT in the new body.\n   (6,4) is NOT in the new body.\n   So I have 3 open squares from (6,3).\n   \n   At (7,2):\n   Current body: [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)].\n   Move RIGHT to (7,2).\n   New body: [(7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n   (7,1) is in the new body.\n   (6,2) is in the new body.\n   (8,2) is NOT in the new body.\n   (7,3) is NOT in the new body.\n   So I have 2 open squares (7,3) and (8,2) from (7,2).\n   \n   (6,3) offers more mobility (3 options) than (7,2) (2 options).\n   (6,3) also allows me to reach (5,4) in case (7,3) becomes contested or I want to plan ahead.\n   From (6,3): (5,3) -> (5,4).\n   From (7,2): (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4). It takes 3 moves from (7,2) to (5,4).\n   \n   Also, (6,3) is closer to the center, giving access to the left side.\n   (7,2) is pinned a bit more to the right.\n   \n   However, let's look at the enemy again.\n   Enemy at (1,4).\n   If the enemy moves UP to (1,5) (eating apple), it's at (1,5).\n   If it moves RIGHT to (2,4) (empty), it's at (2,4).\n   If it moves DOWN to (1,3) (body), collision.\n   \n   If I am at (6,3) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (2,4), we are far apart.\n   \n   One risk to consider: The apple at (7,3).\n   Is it possible the enemy wants it? No, enemy is at x=1. Distance is huge.\n   \n   What about other snakes? The prompt says \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0\". Only one enemy.\n   \n   Let's look at the apples again.\n   Apples: (0,9), (0,7), (7,8), (7,9), (7,3), (6,0), (0,8), (0,0), (2,9), (5,4), (3,7), (2,6), (5,0), (1,5), (9,9).\n   \n   (7,8) and (7,9) are near the top right. My body is currently at (9,1)-(9,6). If I eat (7,3) and grow, I will be near (7,3)-(7,4). I can eventually move up to (7,8).\n   (9,9) is also there. But my body blocks (9,7) and (9,8) currently? No, my body is at (9,6). (9,7) is empty. (9,8) is empty. (9,9) is an apple.\n   Wait, if I stay near the right wall, I can go for (9,9).\n   Path to (9,9): (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (9,9).\n   But I am at (6,2). I need to get back to the right wall.\n   My body is currently blocking the path to the right wall because I am at x=6 and my body occupies x=6,7,8,9 at y=1.\n   To get to (9,6) or (9,7), I need to move UP.\n   \n   If I go UP to (6,3):\n   Body: (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   Next move to (6,4): Body: (6,3), (6,2), ...\n   Next move to (6,5): Body: (6,4), ...\n   Next move to (6,6): Body: (6,5), ...\n   Next move to (7,6): Body: (6,6), ...\n   Next move to (8,6): Body: (7,6), ...\n   Next move to (9,6): Body: (8,6), ...\n   This seems like a long loop.\n   \n   If I want to reach (9,9), I should probably avoid expanding my body too much in the middle.\n   But eating apples is the primary goal to win.\n   (7,3) is the closest apple. I should eat it.\n   \n   Let's compare UP and RIGHT again.\n   UP (6,3) -> Right (7,3).\n   Right (7,2) -> Up (7,3).\n   \n   From (6,3), after eating (7,3):\n   Head (7,3). Body (6,3), (6,2), ...\n   Open: (7,4), (8,3), (7,2) (blocked by body (6,2)? No, (7,2) is NOT in body. Body is (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)...).\n   Wait. Body after (6,3) -> (7,3):\n   Current body: [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)].\n   Move to (7,3): New body [(7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)].\n   Open from (7,3): (7,4), (8,3), (7,2).\n   (6,3) is body.\n   \n   From (7,2), after eating (7,3):\n   Current body: [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6)].\n   Move to (7,3): New body [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4)].\n   Open from (7,3): (7,4), (8,3), (6,3).\n   (7,2) is body.\n   \n   The resulting state is identical in terms of the shape of the snake and available moves (except the specific coordinates of the body segments are slightly shifted).\n   \n   However, (6,3) puts me further left.\n   (7,2) puts me closer to the right wall.\n   \n   If I am at (7,2), I can easily access (8,2) -> (9,2) (but (9,2) is body). Actually, from (7,2), (8,2) is open.\n   From (6,3), (5,3) is open.\n   \n   Is there any reason to prefer the right side?\n   The right side has apples at (7,8), (7,9), (9,9).\n   The left side has apples at (0,0), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,5), (2,6), (2,9), (3,7).\n   The enemy is on the left.\n   The enemy is going for left-side apples.\n   If I go to the right, I avoid the enemy and secure the right-side apples.\n   \n   Currently, my body is anchored on the right wall (x=9).\n   If I move LEFT to (5,2) or UP to (6,3), I move away from my tail (which is at (9,6)).\n   The further I move away from my tail, the more I risk trapping myself if the board gets crowded.\n   \n   However, the board is 10x10. My body length is 10 (1 head + 9 body = 10 segments).\n   If I eat (7,3), I will be length 11.\n   \n   Let's look at the space on the right.\n   Top right is mostly empty except for my tail.\n   (8,3), (7,4), (8,4) etc are empty.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2):\n   I am at x=7.\n   From (7,2) -> (7,3) (Eat).\n   From (7,3) -> (8,3).\n   From (8,3) -> (9,3) (Body). Can't.\n   From (8,3) -> (8,4).\n   This path seems fine.\n   \n   If I go UP to (6,3):\n   I am at x=6.\n   From (6,3) -> (7,3) (Eat).\n   From (7,3) -> (8,3).\n   From (8,3) -> (8,4).\n   Also fine.\n   \n   The difference is minimal.\n   \n   Let's check the \"Rules and win conditions\".\n   \"If you move directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n   My head is at (6,2).\n   My body starts at (6,1).\n   \"Directly behind\" depends on the move.\n   If I move UP to (6,3), the cell behind is (6,2) (my current head).\n   My current head will become the neck. (6,2) will be in my body.\n   But I am moving *away* from (6,1).\n   \n   Let's verify the \"moving backwards\" rule with the move LEFT (5,2).\n   The cell behind (relative to direction) is (7,2).\n   (7,2) is empty.\n   \n   Let's verify the \"moving backwards\" rule with the move RIGHT (7,2).\n   The cell behind is (5,2).\n   (5,2) is empty.\n   \n   Let's verify the \"moving backwards\" rule with the move UP (6,3).\n   The cell behind is (6,1).\n   (6,1) is my body.\n   However, \"directly backwards\" usually refers to the move that reverses the previous direction.\n   My last move was UP (from (6,1) to (6,2)).\n   If I move DOWN (to (6,1)), I die.\n   If I move UP (to (6,3)), I continue. This is not \"moving backwards\".\n   \n   Okay, so all moves are safe regarding the \"backwards\" rule, except DOWN which hits the body directly.\n   \n   Let's look at the enemy.\n   Enemy Head (1,4). Body (1,3)...\n   If the enemy moves UP to (1,5), it eats an apple.\n   If it moves RIGHT to (2,4), it moves towards the center.\n   If it moves DOWN to (1,3), it dies.\n   If it moves LEFT to (0,4), it is out of bounds (x=0 is valid, y=4 is valid). (0,4) is empty.\n   \n   Is there a collision risk?\n   My head (6,2).\n   If I go UP to (6,3).\n   If enemy goes RIGHT to (2,4). Safe.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2).\n   If enemy goes RIGHT to (2,4). Safe.\n   \n   The enemy is far.\n   \n   So the decision comes down to strategy.\n   I want to eat the apple at (7,3).\n   I want to secure the right side.\n   \n   If I go UP to (6,3):\n   I am at (6,3). I can go to (5,3), (6,4), (7,3).\n   If I go RIGHT to (7,2):\n   I am at (7,2). I can go to (7,3), (8,2).\n   \n   If I go UP, I have more space.\n   If I go RIGHT, I am closer to the right wall.\n   \n   Let's check the board state again.\n   Row 2: `. T T T T . 1 . . T`\n   My head is at (6,2).\n   Row 2: col 0 `.`, col 1 `T` (enemy), col 2 `T` (enemy), col 3 `T` (enemy), col 4 `T` (enemy), col 5 `.`, col 6 `1`, col 7 `.`, col 8 `.`, col 9 `T`.\n   \n   If I move RIGHT to (7,2):\n   New head (7,2).\n   New body: (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   Row 2 will have: ... col 6 `T` (old head), col 7 `1` (new head).\n   Row 1 will have: ... col 6 `T` (old body), col 7 `T` (old body), col 8 `T`, col 9 `T`.\n   \n   If I move UP to (6,3):\n   New head (6,3).\n   New body: (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6).\n   Row 3 will have: ... col 6 `1`.\n   Row 2 will have: ... col 6 `T`.\n   \n   Is (7,2) safer than (6,3)?\n   (7,2) is near my body at (7,1) and (8,1) and (9,1).\n   (6,3) is near my body at (6,2) and (6,1).\n   \n   Let's consider the apple at (5,0).\n   It is at (5,0). Bottom row.\n   My body is at (6,1), (7,1)...\n   To get to (5,0), I need to go DOWN.\n   From (6,2), I can't go DOWN.\n   From (6,3), I can go DOWN to (6,2) (body), LEFT-DOWN to (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (5,0).\n   From (7,2), I can go LEFT to (6,2) (body)...\n   \n   So (5,0) is blocked for now.\n   \n   Let's focus on the immediate goal: (7,3).\n   Both UP and RIGHT lead to (7,3) next turn.\n   \n   Is there any difference in the \"dead ends\"?\n   From (6,3), if I go (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) -> (9,6). (9,6) is my tail.\n   If I go (6,4) -> (5,4). (5,4) is an apple.\n   \n   From (7,2), if I go (7,3) -> (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) -> (9,6).\n   \n   Both seem fine.\n   \n   Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt.\n   It says: \"My head: (6, 1)\".\n   Wait, the prompt says \"Turn: 24 / 150\".\n   And \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 2)\".\n   And \"START LAST MOVE ... UP\".\n   So the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" refers to the *previous* turn (Turn 23).\n   In Turn 23, I was at (6,1). I moved UP to (6,2).\n   \n   Now I am at (6,2).\n   \n   The \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text says:\n   \"My head: (6, 1)\"\n   \"Evaluating moves from (6, 1):\"\n   \"UP to (6, 2): Board shows (6, 2) contains an apple (A)\"\n   \"Decision: UP\"\n   \n   So I ate the apple at (6,2). My score is now 9.\n   \n   Now I am at (6,2). The apple is gone.\n   I need to choose a move.\n   \n   Let's re-evaluate the board state carefully.\n   Apples listed: (0, 9), (0, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 3), (6, 0), (0, 8), (0, 0), (2, 9), (5, 4), (3, 7), (2, 6), (5, 0), (1, 5), (9, 9).\n   \n   Is (6,2) in this list?

(8,3) is not.\n   So (6,3) offers a better immediate follow-up trajectory towards an apple ((5,4)).\n   \n   Also, if I go UP to (6,3), I am in a better position to intercept the apple at (5,4) if the enemy tries to go for it (unlikely from (1,4) but possible).\n   \n   So, UP seems like the better move for flexibility and targeting the next apple.\n   \n   Wait, looking at the map again.\n   Row 4: `4 . 0 . . T A . . . T`\n   The 'T' at (4,4) is the enemy's body.\n   The apple is at (5,4).\n   The enemy is at (1,4).\n   The enemy cannot reach (5,4) in one move.\n   The enemy cannot reach (5,4) in two moves (needs to cross (4,4) which is its own body, or go around).\n   Actually, the enemy body is at (4,4). The enemy head is at (1,4).\n   The enemy is trapped in a tunnel on the left?\n   No, (1,4) has neighbors (1,5), (1,3), (0,4), (2,4).\n   (1,3) is body. (0,4) is empty. (2,4) is empty. (1,5) is apple.\n   \n   The enemy is not immediately threatening (5,4).\n   \n   So I have time to get (7,3) then (5,4).\n   \n   Path: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (7,3) (Eat) -> (7,4) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) (Eat).\n   \n   Or: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) (Eat).\n   \n   Let's stick to the plan of getting the closest apple first: (7,3).\n   \n   To get to (7,3), I can go UP or RIGHT.\n   UP to (6,3) seems better for mobility.\n   \n   Let's double check the \"Rules\" for \"moving backwards\".\n   \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n   My head is at (6,2). My previous move was UP.\n   Moving DOWN to (6,1) is moving backwards. That's death.\n   Moving UP is forward.\n   Moving LEFT is left.\n   Moving RIGHT is right.\n   \n   Okay.\n   \n   Final check:\n   My head: (6,2).\n   Move UP to (6,3).\n   Is (6,3) on board? Yes.\n   Is (6,3) in my body? No.\n   Is (6,3) in enemy body? No.\n   Is (6,3) an apple? No (Apple at (7,3) is close).\n   Is (6,3) safe from head-on collision? Enemy at (1,4).

Body (6,3), (6,2), ...\n   Neighbors: (7,2), (7,4), (8,3).\n   (7,2) will be empty (body moves from (6,2) to (6,3), (6,2) to (6,3)? No, body is (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)...)\n   Wait, after moving to (7,3):\n   Body: [(7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5)].\n   (7,2) is NOT in the body.\n   (8,3) is NOT in the body.\n   (7,4) is NOT in the body.\n   So I will have 3 options from (7,3) as well.\n   \n   So the plan is solid.\n   Move UP.\n   \n   Wait, looking at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again.\n   \"The enemy is heading toward the top-right cluster of apples (7,8), (7,9).\"\n   As I calculated, enemy is at (1,4). Distance to (7,8) is 10.\n   It's not heading there. It's heading to (1,5) or (2,6).\n   The previous rationale was slightly inaccurate about the enemy's immediate target, but the conclusion (secure my own apples) was correct.\n   \n   I am confident in UP.\n   \n   Why not RIGHT?\n   RIGHT puts me at (7,2).\n   From (7,2), I can go UP to (7,3) (Apple).\n   From (7,2), I can go RIGHT to (8,2).\n   (8,2) is empty.\n   (8,3) is empty.\n   This is also a valid path.\n   \n   But (6,3) gives me access to (5,3) -> (5,4).\n   (7,2) gives me access to (8,2) -> (8,3).\n   (5,4) is an apple. (8,3) is empty.\n   So (6,3) is better for targeting the *next* apple after (7,3).\n   \n   So UP is the winner.\n   \n   One final check: (6,3) vs (7,2) collision risks.\n   (6,3) is at x=6.\n   (7,2) is at x=7.\n   If I go UP to (6,3), and the enemy decides to do something crazy... but it can't reach me.\n   \n   Okay.\n   \n   Move: UP.\n   \n   Plan for next turn:\n   Move to (6,3).\n   Next move will be RIGHT to (7,3) to eat the apple.\n   Then plan to go to (5,4) or (7,4) depending on the situation.\n   \n   Note to self:\n   \"I am at (6,2). Moving UP to (6,3) to prepare for eating the apple at (7,3) next turn. This position also offers a path to the apple at (5,4). The enemy is on the left side and poses no immediate threat to the right side apples.\"\n   \n   Wait, the instructions say:\n   \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.

Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? My body at (6, 3), (6, 2) ... No.\n    *   Is it occupied by the enemy body? The enemy body is mostly on the left side. The closest body part is at (1, 5). Distance is $\\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (5-5)^2} = 5$. It's not occupied.\n    *   **Verdict: Safe.**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? **YES.** My body includes (6, 3) (which was my head last turn).\n    *   **Verdict: UNSAFE (Self-collision).**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by the enemy body? The enemy body at (4, 4) is adjacent. Distance is 1. It is occupied.\n    *   **Verdict: UNSAFE (Into enemy body).**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by the enemy body? No.\n    *   **Verdict: Safe.**\n\n**Safe Moves Available:**\n- **UP (6, 5)**\n- **RIGHT (7, 4)**\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n**Option 1: Move UP to (6, 5)**\n- **Immediate Benefit:** Closes the distance to the apple at (7, 5) (1 unit away) and (5, 4) (2 units away).\n- **Future Openings:** From (6, 5), the exits are:\n    - (6, 6) - Open (currently empty).\n    - (7, 5) - Open (apple is there).\n    - (5, 5) - Open (empty).\n    - (6, 4) - Open (tail will move off, allowing re-entry).\n    - 4 safe moves available.\n- **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (1, 6). Their reach is limited. If they move UP to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 6), they do not threaten (6, 5).\n- **Long-term Logic:** I am currently \"vertically lined up\" with my body segments (x=6). Moving UP keeps me on this vertical axis, allowing my tail to unravel downwards or follow me up. This maintains a clean path for my body to follow.\n\n**Option 2: Move RIGHT to (7, 4)**\n- **Immediate Benefit:** Moves directly onto the apple at (7, 4) (based on board state, though (7, 4) isn't listed in the apples list, looking at the board string `4 . T . . T A 1 . . T` -> column 4 is a dot, column 6 is A, column 7 is 1... wait, let's re-read the board string carefully).\n    - Board Row 4 (y=4): ` . T . . T A 1 . . T`\n    - Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n    - Col 7 is empty (dot). No apple there.\n- **Future Openings:** From (7, 4), the exits are:\n    - (7, 5) - Open.\n    - (8, 4) - Open.\n    - (6, 4) - Open.\n    - (7, 3) - Blocked by my body (6, 3)? No, (7, 3) is empty (Board row 3: ` . T . . T . T A . T` -> Col 7 is dot).\n    - 4 safe moves available.\n- **Strategic Drawback:** Moving RIGHT increases the horizontal distance between my head and my vertical body column (x=6). This forces my body to make a right-angle turn at (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1). If I keep moving right, I risk creating a loop or trapping myself against the right wall (x=9). The right wall is currently occupied by my tail (9, 1) to (9, 4).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Safety:** Both are safe immediately.\n- **Fruit:** Neither offers an immediate apple (Apple at (6, 0) is far; (5, 4) is 1 unit away from both; (7, 3) is 1 unit away from both).\n- **Positioning:** **UP** is superior. It allows me to approach the cluster of apples at (5, 4) and (7, 3) while keeping my body aligned vertically. This alignment is crucial for survival; it minimizes the risk of boxing myself in against the wall. If I go RIGHT, I am moving into the right-hand corner where my tail is currently occupying the wall. Going UP opens the top half of the board.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (6, 5). From there, I can target the apple at (5, 4) or (7, 3) in subsequent turns while maintaining a safe body structure.\n\nUP",

I am currently safe from the enemy on the left.\n    *   **Long-term:** I am approaching the apple at (7, 3) and (7, 8) from a central vertical position. This keeps options open.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (5, 5)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves towards the apple at (5, 4).\n    *   **Risk:** This moves me closer to the enemy's territory (left side). The enemy is at (2, 6). Distance from (5, 5) to (2, 6) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} \\approx 3.16$. While currently safe, moving left reduces my buffer zone against the enemy's potential forward movement.\n    *   **Future:** From (5, 5), I am cornered by my own body if I go Down or Left (wall).\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (7, 5)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves toward the apple at (7, 3) (via (7, 4) next turn) and (7, 8).\n    *   **Risk:** I am currently at (6, 5). My body runs from (6, 4) down to (6, 1), then Right to (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1). If I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am moving horizontally *above* the \"staircase\" of my body. This is safe *now*, but if I continue Right, I must be careful not to create a loop where my body blocks my return path.\n    *   **Comparison:** (7, 5) is just as good as (6, 6) strategically.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (6, 6) is the most defensive and flexible move.\n1.  **Safety:** It maximizes distance from the enemy on the left.\n2.  **Alignment:** It keeps my body in a straight vertical line (column 6), which is the most efficient configuration for a snake. A vertical line allows the tail to move up easily without creating loops.\n3.  **Apple Access:** From (6, 6), I can target the top apples ((7, 8), (7, 9)) or loop back down to the apples at (5, 4) and (7, 3).\n4.  **Trapping:** Moving LEFT or RIGHT while my body is vertical risks \"pinching\" my tail or blocking my own path if I need to retreat. Moving UP keeps the path behind me clear for the tail to follow.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP. Maintain vertical integrity. Assess enemy movement next turn. If the enemy pushes aggressively, I will have the central position to outmaneuver them.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

DOWN would shrink my immediate mobility (only 2 safe follow-ups: RIGHT or DOWN) and potentially trap me near my own segments.

(6, 7) is directly adjacent to the apple at (7, 8).\n    *   **Safety:** Keeps me in the center. The enemy is moving Left/Down towards (0, 9) or trying to cut me off, but they are far away.\n    *   **Risk:** None immediate. My body remains a clean vertical line, maximizing mobility.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (5, 6)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves toward the apple at (5, 4) and (3, 7).\n    *   **Risk:** Moves me closer to the enemy's \"home territory\" on the left. The enemy is currently at (2, 7), just 3 tiles away. While safe now, moving left risks a potential head-on collision or being trapped if the enemy moves aggressively.\n    *   **Comparison:** Less safe than UP because of proximity to the enemy.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (7, 6)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves toward (7, 3) and (7, 8).\n    *   **Analysis:** (7, 6) is adjacent to (7, 8) (via (7, 7)). It's also adjacent to (8, 2) (via (8, 6)... no that's not a direct path). (7, 6) is actually *directly* between (7, 8) and (7, 3).\n    *   **Comparison:** UP is slightly safer than RIGHT because UP maintains a clean vertical column. If I go RIGHT now, I might create a path that requires complex maneuvering later. UP keeps the path behind me simple.\n\n**Decision:**\n**UP** is the strongest move.\n1.  **Safety:** It maintains maximum distance from the enemy snake which is currently on the left side.\n2.  **Alignment:** Staying in column 6 keeps my body vertical and flexible.\n3.  **Apple Targets:** I am now setting up to snipe the apples at (7, 8) and (7, 9) or pivot to (5, 4).\n4.  **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy snake at (2, 7) with an open tail at (4, 3) likely wants to head towards the top-left apples. By going UP, I stay central and out of their immediate \"attack zone,\" while maintaining pressure on the top-right apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nReach (6, 7). From there, assess a move to (7, 7) or (7, 8) to grab the apples in the top-right cluster. Watch the enemy snake to ensure they don't try to cut me off. Maintain vertical integrity as long as possible.\n\nUP",

Their head is at (3, 7), just 3 tiles away from my head at (6, 7). The enemy has an open tail at (4, 3).\n    *   *Movement Prediction:* The enemy is likely trying to loop around or head towards the top-left apples (0,9), (0,8), (2,9). They are too long to effectively chase me directly. If they turn Right towards me, they will likely have to wait for their own body to clear out of the way, or they risk trapping themselves. Their movement is restricted by their own massive body.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** Inside.\n    *   **Self:** Clear (My body is at 6,6 -> 6,1).\n    *   **Enemy:** The enemy head is at (3, 7). The enemy body extends from (2,7) down to (2,6) and further left. (6,8) is far away and clear.\n    *   **Result:** **Safe.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Self:** (6, 6) is my immediate body segment directly behind my head.\n    *   **Result:** **Unsafe (Self-collision).**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** Inside.\n    *   **Self:** Clear.\n    *   **Enemy:** The enemy head is at (3, 7). (5, 7) is two tiles away. **However**, the enemy body occupies (2, 7) and (2, 6). If the enemy moves UP or RIGHT, they could potentially land on (4,7) or (4,8), or if they move LEFT/DOWN, they might stay near (2,7). Moving to (5, 7) brings my head into close proximity with the enemy's head and their active body zone.\n    *   **Risk:** High risk of a head-on collision. If the enemy moves Right to (4,7) and I move Left to (5,7), we don't collide *this turn*, but we cross paths immediately. If the enemy moves Right to (4,7) and I move Left to (5,7) and they *continue* moving Right next turn, I am dead. Given the enemy's length, they might be forced to move Left (down) to avoid trapping themselves, but I should not assume that.\n    *   **Result:** **Risky (Avoid).**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** Inside.\n    *   **Self:** Clear.\n    *   **Enemy:** Clear.\n    *   **Result:** **Safe.**\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **The Threat:** The enemy snake (ID 0) is long (12 segments) and located to my left. My head is at (6,7) and the enemy head is at (3,7). The horizontal distance is 3 tiles. The enemy's body blocks a significant portion of the left side.\n*   **Option 1: UP to (6, 8)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves me into the top-left area, directly adjacent to the apple at (7, 8) and (7, 9).\n    *   **Apple Access:** (7, 8) is immediately reachable (1 tile away). (7, 9) is 2 tiles away. (2, 9) is 4 tiles away but requires crossing the enemy's path.\n    *   **Safety:** This move increases the distance from the enemy's head (3,7). It positions me to snake along the top wall towards the right-side apples. My vertical body configuration remains intact, allowing me to reverse direction if necessary.\n    *   **Plan:** Next turn, I can likely move RIGHT to (7, 8) or UP to (6, 9) depending on the apple priority. (7, 8) and (7, 9) are currently unobstructed.\n\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (7, 7)**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moves me towards the right side of the board.\n    *   **Apple Access:** Moves closer to (7, 8) (1 tile away).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, but slightly less optimal than UP because it narrows my vertical play space. If I go RIGHT now, I am at (7, 7). If I need to retreat later, I have fewer options than if I were at (6, 8) where I have the entire column 6 open behind me.\n    *   **Comparison:** UP preserves the clean vertical column 6 as a \"tail\" which is a strong defensive position. Moving RIGHT moves me into column 7, which is open but separates me from my body's column.\n\n**Decision:**\n**UP** is the best move.\n1.  **Maximize Distance:** It moves me further away from the threatening enemy snake on the left.\n2.  **Apple Targeting:** It moves me directly toward the dense cluster of apples at (7,8) and (7,9).\n3.  **Safety/Escape:** It keeps my body trailing neatly in column 6, which is the safest configuration for a snake of my length. If the enemy approaches aggressively, I can retreat down or loop around.\n4.  **Enemy Limitation:** The enemy is too long to effectively cut me off from the top-right apples if I start moving UP now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (6, 8). Prepare to move RIGHT to (7, 8) next turn to eat the apple there, or UP to (6, 9) to eat (7, 9) from the side. Keep the enemy on the left; do not cross into column 5 or 4 unless the enemy has moved significantly away. Maintain vertical integrity.\n\nUP",

My body is [(6, 7), (6, 6), ..., (8, 1)]. This vertical alignment in column 6 is a strong defensive formation.\n*   **Enemy Position:** The enemy snake #0 (ID 0) has moved. Its head was at (3, 8). Looking at the board state \"9 A . A . . . . A . A\" and \"8 A . . 0 . . 1 A . .\", the enemy head '0' is at (3, 9) (Top Left quadrant). Its body is filling the lower left quadrant. The enemy is occupying the entire left side of the board, effectively blocking access to apples (0,9), (0,8), (2,9) for the foreseeable future. The enemy is very long and slow.\n*   **Board State & Apples:**\n    *   High-value immediate target: (7, 8) is directly to my right.\n    *   Nearby targets: (7, 9), (5, 4), (6, 0).\n    *   Enemy territory: Left side (x <= 4) is blocked.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (6, 9) is on the top wall.\n    *   **Safety:** The board shows '.' at (6, 9). My body is at (6, 8) below. Enemy body is far left. No immediate collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves to the top wall. Reduces mobility (can't go further up). Allows access to (7, 9) next turn (RIGHT). However, it leaves the apple at (7, 8) accessible to the enemy if they move Right, or if I choose to move there later. It exposes me to the top-left corner where the enemy is.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (7, 8) contains an apple 'A'.\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 8) is not in my body path. Enemy is at x=3. Safe from collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is the optimal move.\n        *   **Apple Gain:** It consumes an apple (score +1).\n        *   **Growth:** Eating an apple prevents the tail from moving forward, effectively extending my length. This is crucial because my current body occupies columns 6 and 7-9. Growing ensures my tail stays anchored in column 6 for longer, maintaining my vertical defense.\n        *   **Positioning:** It moves me towards the center-top (7, 8), keeping me close to the (7, 9) apple and the (8, 2) / (8, 0) cluster.\n        *   **Risk:** Minimal. The enemy is blocked on the left.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (5, 8).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls/self.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves toward the enemy's side. While (5, 8) is currently empty, moving left puts me closer to the enemy's head/body. The enemy is long and fills x=1-4. Getting closer increases risk of a head-on collision or being trapped. I want to stay on the right/center side.\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (6, 7).\n    *   **Safety:** This is the segment of my body immediately behind my head. Moving here would cause self-collision and instant death.\n    *   **Result:** **Illegal/Fatal.**\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move **RIGHT to (7, 8)** is superior.\n1.  **Immediate Point:** It gains an apple, increasing my score to 10 (closing the gap with the enemy's 11).\n2.  **Strategic Growth:** Eating the apple grows my snake. A longer snake can defend space better, and crucially, the tail doesn't shift forward this turn, preserving the safety buffer in column 6.\n3.  **Positional Advantage:** It keeps me on the right side of the board, away from the crowded left side occupied by the enemy.\n4.  **Future Options:** From (7, 8), I can easily move to (7, 9), (8, 8), or (6, 8) next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 8). Secure the top-right cluster (7, 9) next. Maintain distance from the enemy snake on the left. Avoid getting pinned against the top wall; be ready to move down or right if the enemy approaches.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

I have moved to (7, 8) and consumed the apple there.\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (7, 8).\n*   **New Body:** The tail remains at (8, 1) because I ate an apple. The body is now: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), ..., (8, 1)].\n*   **Apple Removed:** (7, 8) is no longer an apple.\n\n**2. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (7, 8).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   (7, 7) is occupied by my body (segment 7 in the body list). (Wait, let me re-check the list). My body list is [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)].\n    *   The cell (6, 8) is immediately behind my head. (7, 7) is diagonally down-left and is empty.\n    *   So, moving DOWN to (7, 7) is safe from self-collision. It does not go directly back into the immediate segment.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (6, 8) is directly backwards into the immediate body segment. **This is fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision (Body):** The enemy snake #0 is at x=1-3. I am at x=7. No body collision.\n*   **Wall Collision:** (7, 8) is not on the wall. All moves are on board.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 9):**\n    *   **Target:** (7, 9) contains an apple 'A'.\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 9) is not in my body. Enemy is far left.\n    *   **Strategy:** Immediate point gain. Moves to the top-right corner. High value. Reduces vertical mobility to 0 (wall).\n\n*   **DOWN to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Maintains position relative to wall. Keeps options open to move to (8, 8) or (6, 8) (careful) later. However, (7, 7) puts me closer to (8, 2) and (8, 0) apples. I am currently in a defensive formation in column 6. Moving down breaks the vertical line slightly, but (7, 7) connects to (6, 8) above it? No, (6, 8) is to the left. My body occupies the line x=6 from y=8 down to y=1, and then snakes to (7, 1) and (8, 1).\n    *   Actually, my body is a vertical line at x=6 (y=1 to 8) and a foot at (7,1), (8,1).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (7, 7) places my head at y=7.\n    *   My body is at (6, 8) [left], (6, 7) [down-left], (6, 6) [left-down], etc.\n    *   This move is safe.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the right edge column (x=8). From here, I can access (8, 2) and (8, 0) apples. (9, 9) is also accessible if I go UP next. This keeps me in the open right side.\n\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** My own body.\n    *   **Result:** **Fatal.** Cannot do.\n\n**4. Comparison and Decision:**\n*   **UP (7, 9):** Gets an apple. Score becomes 11. Matches enemy score (if they didn't score this turn). Moves to a corner (wall limits escape). The enemy is on the left. If I am at (7, 9), I can still go to (8, 9) next (empty) or (6, 9) or (7, 8) (body). Wait, (7, 8) will be my body next turn? Yes, if I move UP, my body extends. The tail stays at (8, 1). My new body will be [(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8)...].\n    *   If I am at (7, 9), my future moves are (8, 9), (6, 9), (7, 8). (7, 8) will be my body. So I can only go (8, 9) or (6, 9).\n    *   (6, 9) is empty (based on last turn's board). (8, 9) is empty.\n    *   So I have 2 options from (7, 9). This is acceptable.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 8):** No immediate points. Keeps me central-right. Allows movement to (9, 8), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 9).\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** No immediate points. Moves me slightly lower. Allows (7, 6), (8, 7), (6, 7).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is on the left. I am on the right.\nI currently have 10 apples. Enemy has 11.\nTaking the apple at (7, 9) ties the score at 11.\nThis is a low-risk move. The enemy is far away and blocked by their own body on the left. They cannot reach (7, 9) in one turn.\nThe wall at y=9 is a constraint, but (7, 9) is a high-value target. Being at (7, 9) also blocks the enemy from entering the top-right corner easily if they ever loop around (unlikely soon).\nIf I don't take the apple, the enemy might eventually get it if they break out, or I might lose the opportunity.\nGiven the turn count (31/150) and the score gap, closing the gap is prudent.\nSafety is high. The enemy is not moving right (they are trapped in the left funnel).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move UP to (7, 9) to eat the apple.\n2.  Score becomes 11.\n3.  Prepare to move to (8, 9) or (6, 9) next turn to avoid the wall trap.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Turn Analysis (Turn 32/150)**\n\n**1. Update from Last Move:**\nMy move UP was successful. I ate the apple at (7, 9).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (7, 9).\n*   **New Body:** I grew. The tail remains at (8, 1). The body is now: [(7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)].\n*   **Apple Removed:** (7, 9) is gone.\n*   **Score Update:** My score is now 12. Enemy score is 12. We are tied.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2, 9). Based on the board state (Turn 32), the enemy snake body is between x=1 and x=3 on the left side. The enemy head is at (2, 9). The enemy is effectively blocked in the left corridor. They cannot cross over to the right side because my body (at x=6) and the enemy's own body block the path. The enemy is not a direct threat to my current location.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (7, 9). Top edge of the board (y=9).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 10) is off the board. **Fatal.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 9) is empty. My body is at (7, 8) [down], (6, 8) [down-left]. (6, 9) is safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 8) is occupied by my own body (the second segment). **Fatal.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 9) is empty. My body is at (7, 8) [down] and (8, 8) is empty. (8, 9) is safe.\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy is at x=1-3. My x=7. No collision possible.\n*   **Wall Collision:**\n    *   (7, 9) is the top wall.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the left edge of the board. (6, 9) is adjacent to the corner (9,9) is top-right, (6,9) is top-middle-left). This position is still on the top edge. From (6, 9), future moves would be: UP (invalid), DOWN (to 6,8 - which will be my body next turn? Wait, if I move to (6,9), my body follows. The segment at (7,8) moves to (7,9), and the segment at (6,8) moves to (7,8). So (6,8) will be empty next turn? No, wait. My body is [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8)...]. If I move LEFT to (6,9), my new body is [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,8)...]. So (6,9) is safe, but (6,8) is occupied. Moving DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8) would be self-collision next turn if I don't plan. However, immediate safety is fine. The main issue is that (6,9) is on the top wall. If I go there, I limit my vertical mobility just as much as staying at (7,9) (which is also on the wall).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to (8, 9). This is in the top-right corner. It allows me to access (9, 9) next turn if I want. However, (9, 9) is an apple (from the list), but the board state shows '1' at (9,9) in row 9? Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n    *   Board Row 9: `9 A A 0 T . . . 1 . A`\n        *   (0,9) is A\n        *   (1,9) is A\n        *   (2,9) is 0 (Enemy Head)\n        *   (6,9) is .\n        *   (7,9) is 1 (My Head)\n        *   (8,9) is .\n        *   (9,9) is A (Apple)\n    *   So (9,9) is an apple. Moving to (8,9) sets me up to eat (9,9) next turn.\n    *   However, I am at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), I am still on the top wall.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (7,8)? That is fatal (into body).\n    *   If I move UP? Fatal.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (6,9)? Safe, but puts me further from the right-side apples (8,2, 8,0).\n\n**5. Long Term Strategy & The Trap:**\nI am currently at (7,9). I am on the top wall.\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9), I am in the corner.\nFrom (8,9), my options are:\n- UP: Fatal (wall)\n- RIGHT: Fatal (wall)\n- DOWN: (8,8). Is (8,8) safe?\n    - My body: [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8)...]. (8,8) is empty.\n- LEFT: (7,9). (7,9) will be my body (specifically the neck) next turn. So LEFT is fatal.\n\nSo from (8,9), I am forced to go DOWN to (8,8). This is a \"forced move\".\nIs (8,8) safe?\nIf I go to (8,8):\n- My body will be [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8)...]\n- From (8,8), options:\n    - UP: (8,9) -> Body. Fatal.\n    - LEFT: (7,8) -> Body. Fatal.\n    - RIGHT: (9,8). Is (9,8) safe? Board row 8: `8 A . . T . . T T . .`. (9,8) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    - DOWN: (8,7). Board row 7: `7 A . T T . . T . . .`. (8,7) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n\nSo moving to (8,9) leads to a forced move DOWN to (8,8), where I have options RIGHT or DOWN. This is acceptable. I am not trapped. I am navigating the corner.\n\nConsider the alternative LEFT to (6,9).\nFrom (6,9):\n- UP: Fatal\n- LEFT: (5,9). Board row 9: `... 0 T . . . 1 . . A`. (5,9) is `T` (Enemy Body? No, Enemy is at x=2-3. Let's check board again).\n    - Row 9: `9 A A 0 T . . . 1 . A`\n    - Index 0: A\n    - Index 1: A\n    - Index 2: 0\n    - Index 3: T (Enemy Body)\n    - Index 4: .\n    - Index 5: .\n    - Index 6: .\n    - Index 7: .\n    - Index 8: 1\n    - Index 9: A\n    - Wait, the string is \"9 A A 0 T . . . 1 . A\". The coordinates are 0-9.\n    - (5,9) corresponds to the 6th character (0-indexed 5). That is `.`.\n    - (4,9) corresponds to index 4. That is `T`. (Part of enemy body).\n    - So (5,9) is empty.\n    - If I go LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I could go LEFT to (5,9).\n    - From (5,9), I am still on the top row. This seems like I'm just sliding along the top edge.\n    - The goal is to stay alive and eat apples. The apples are mostly at (8,2), (8,0), (9,9) etc. Being on the left side (x=6) moves me away from those.\n    - Being on the right side (x=8/9) puts me near those apples.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe enemy is contained. My priority is to secure points and avoid the top-row trap.\nMoving RIGHT to (8,9) seems risky because of the corner, but the subsequent moves are viable (DOWN to 8,8).\nMoving LEFT to (6,9) is safe but leads to a \"wandering\" path on the top row, away from the apples on the right.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\nThe enemy is at (2,9). The board shows `T` at (3,9), (3,8), etc.\nI am at (7,9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9):\n- I get closer to the apple at (9,9).\n- If I am at (8,9), I am in a corner. If I cannot escape the corner, I die. But I calculated I can go DOWN to (8,8).\n- From (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8).\n- (9,8) is empty. (9,7) is part of the wall. (9,6) is empty?\n- Board col 9: `A . . . . . . A . A` (vertical scan)\n    - (9,9) A\n    - (9,8) .\n    - (9,7) .\n    - (9,6) .\n    - (9,5) .\n    - (9,4) .\n    - (9,3) A\n    - (9,2) A\n    - (9,1) T (Enemy body? No, Enemy is at x=1-3. Wait, Board row 1: `1 . . . . . A T T T .`. (9,1) is `.`. The `T` is at (7,1), (6,1), (5,1) ? No, (5,1) is A. (6,1) is T. (7,1) is T. (8,1) is T.\n    - Wait, My body is at (8,1). Enemy body is not at x=8.\n    - (9,1) is `.`.\n- So (9,8) is safe. (9,7) is safe.\n- This path on the right side seems viable.\n\nHowever, the `T` at (8,1) in the board map corresponds to MY body. The map shows '1' for my head. The 'T's are presumably obstacles. The prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nThe board map provided in the prompt likely uses 'T' for generic body parts (self or enemy) and '1'/'0' for heads.\nMy body is at (8,1). The map shows 'T' at (8,1).\nEnemy body is at x=1-3.\nSo (9,8) is empty.\n\nIs there a better move than (8,9)?\n(8,9) is adjacent to the apple at (9,9).\nIf I don't take (9,9) now, it stays there. The enemy is too far to take it.\nThe risk of (8,9) is being cornered. But I have a way out (DOWN).\nIs (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (8,8) a good path?\n(7,9) -> (8,9) -> (9,9) is impossible (UP from 8,9).\nSo I must go DOWN from (8,9).\nThat puts me at (8,8).\nFrom (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8).\n(8,7) is `.`. (9,8) is `.`.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN immediately? No, that's fatal into my own body.\nWhat about LEFT? (6,9).\nFrom (6,9) -> (5,9) -> (4,9) is `T` (Enemy Body). I can't go there.\nFrom (6,9), I can only go LEFT (to 5,9) or DOWN (to 6,8 - Body).\nFrom (5,9), I can go LEFT (to 4,9 - Enemy Body) or DOWN (to 5,8).\n(5,8) is `.` (Board row 8: `8 A . . T . . T T . .` -> index 5 is `.`).\nSo (6,9) -> (5,9) -> (5,8) is a valid path.\nThis path moves me to (5,8), which is more central.\nThe apples are at (8,2), (8,0), (9,9).\nBeing at (5,8) is further from (9,9) than (8,9) is.\n(9,9) is the closest apple to my current position (distance 2).\n(8,2) is distance |7-8| + |9-2| = 1+7 = 8.\n(8,0) is distance 1+9 = 10.\n(5,4) is distance 2+5 = 7.\n(9,9) is the priority.\n\nSo, moving RIGHT towards (9,9) is good.\nThe only way to \"go towards\" (9,9) is to move RIGHT to (8,9).\nThe trap at (8,9) is manageable because I can go DOWN to (8,8).\nFrom (8,8), I am in a good position to target (9,9) again? No, from (8,8) I am below (9,9).\nI can go to (9,8), then (9,9) is not reachable directly (UP from 9,8 is 9,9).\nWait, from (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8).\nFrom (9,8), I can go UP to (9,9).\nIs (9,9) safe in 2 turns?\n(9,9) is an apple.\nIf I go (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (8,8) -> (9,8) -> (9,9).\nThat is 3 turns to eat the apple.\nIf I go (7,9) -> (6,9) -> (5,9) -> (5,8) -> ... I never get (9,9).\nSo (9,9) is only reachable via the top-right corner path.\n\nIs there any risk of dying at (8,9)?\n- Wall collision: No (I'm not moving into a wall, I'm moving onto the edge).\n- Self collision: No (6,9) is empty).\n- Enemy collision: No.\n- Head-on collision: Enemy is at (2,9). To collide at (8,9), enemy would need to move 6 squares right in 1 turn. Impossible.\n\nSo (8,9) is safe for this turn.\nNext turn (at 8,9), I must move DOWN.\nIs (8,8) safe next turn?\nEnemy moves simultaneously.\nIf I am at (8,9), my body is at (7,9).\nNext turn, I move DOWN to (8,8).\nMy body moves: (8,9) -> (7,9), (7,9) -> (7,8).\nEnemy moves.\nCan the enemy reach (8,8)?\nEnemy is at (2,9). To reach (8,8), they need to move 6 right and 1 down. Impossible in 1 turn.\nSo (8,8) is safe next turn.\n\nThe plan:\n1. Move RIGHT to (8,9).\n2. Next turn move DOWN to (8,8).\n3. Then navigate to the apples at (9,9), (8,2), or (8,0).\n\nIs there any other move?\nWhat about DOWN? Fatal.\nWhat about UP? Fatal.\nWhat about LEFT? (6,9).\n(6,9) is safe.\nFrom (6,9), I can move to (5,9).\n(5,9) is empty.\nFrom (5,9), I can move to (5,8).\n(5,8) is empty.\nThis is a safe path, but it leads me away from the apples on the right (9,9, 8,2, 8,0) and towards the left side where the enemy is (although the enemy is trapped).\nThe apples on the left are (0,9), (0,7), (0,8), (0,0), (1,9), (2,0). These are mostly taken or blocked by the enemy/corner.\n(1,9) is an apple. (0,9) is an apple. (0,8) is an apple.\nBut the enemy is at (2,9). The enemy's body blocks the way to (1,9) and (0,9).\nMy body is at x=6.\nIf I go to (6,9), I am near my own body (7,9).\nIf I go to (5,9), I am near enemy body (3,9).\nIt's tight.\nThe right side is open.\nThe right side has apples.\nTherefore, the RIGHT move is strategically superior.\n\nOne final check: The board map shows 'T' at (8,1). This is my body. I am moving my head to (8,9). My tail is at (8,1). The body fills the gap.\nMy body list: [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8), ..., (8,1)].\nIf I move to (8,9), my new body is [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), ...].\nThe cell (8,1) will move to (8,2)? No, the tail only moves if I don't eat an apple. I didn't eat an apple this turn (I ate last turn). So the tail moves.\nWait, I ate at (7,9) on Turn 31.\nSo on Turn 32 (current move), I am moving from (7,9).\nIf I move to (8,9), I did NOT eat an apple (assuming (8,9) is empty).\nTherefore, the tail (8,1) will be removed (the snake does not grow).\nSo my body length stays 12.\nNew body: [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1)].\n(8,1) is vacated.\nThis is correct.\n\nFinal check on the \"backward move\" rule.\nMoving from (7,9) to (6,9) is LEFT.\nIs (6,9) occupied by my body?\nMy body is [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8), ...].\n(6,9) is NOT in the list.\nSo LEFT is safe.\nHowever, RIGHT is also safe and leads to the apples.\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove to (8,9) to approach the apple at (9,9). From there, I will be forced to move DOWN next turn, positioning myself to access the bottom-right apples or loop back to (9,9).\n\nRIGHT",

I moved to (8, 9).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (8, 9).\n*   **New Body:** I did not eat an apple, so I did not grow. My tail (at 8, 1) was removed.\n    *   Current Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1)].\n*   **Score Update:** My score is 11. Enemy score is 13.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1, 9). The enemy is still trapped in the left corridor (x=1 to x=3).\n*   **Enemy Options from (1, 9):**\n    *   **UP:** Off board (Fatal).\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 9) is an Apple (A).\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 9) is currently empty (my previous head pos), but will likely be occupied by my body or wall? No, (2,9) is empty on the board map. However, the enemy's own body is at (2,9)? No, the enemy body is (2,9) in the list, but the head is at (1,9). The body list shows [(2, 9), (3, 9)...]. So (2, 9) is occupied by the enemy's own neck. **RIGHT is fatal** (into own body).\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 8). Board state row 8 shows (1, 8) is `.` (empty). However, the enemy body is at (1, 6), (1, 5), etc. (1, 8) is empty. **DOWN is safe.**\n\nThe enemy is likely to move **LEFT** to eat the apple at (0, 9) or **DOWN** to survive. If the enemy moves LEFT, it will grow and likely become stuck in the corner (0,9), needing to go DOWN next. This effectively removes the enemy from competitive play for a few turns.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (8, 9). Top edge of the board.\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (8, 10) is off board. **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (8, 8). Is (8, 8) occupied?\n        *   My body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...]. (8, 8) is empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** (7, 9). Is (7, 9) occupied?\n        *   Yes, (7, 9) is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (9, 9). Is (9, 9) occupied?\n        *   My body: No. Enemy body: No. It is an Apple. **Safe.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy is at x=1. My x=8. No collision possible.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI am at (8, 9). My options are limited to **DOWN** or **RIGHT**.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 9):**\n    *   **Target:** Apple at (9, 9).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** I eat an apple, growing to length 13. This is the primary objective.\n    *   **Consequence:** Moving to the top-right corner. From (9, 9), the only valid move next turn will be **DOWN** to (9, 8). This is a forced move, but (9, 8) is empty and safe.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** I do not eat. I move to (8, 8).\n    *   **Consequence:** From (8, 8), I can go DOWN (to 8,7) or RIGHT (to 9,8). I miss the apple at (9,9). The enemy (if they survive) might eventually come for it, or it might just sit there. However, taking the point now is better.\n\n**5. Long Term Strategy:**\nI am behind by 2 points (11 vs 13). Taking the apple at (9, 9) is crucial to close the gap.\n*   **Pathing:** (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) ... This path along the right wall is safe and leads toward other apples (e.g., (8, 2), (8, 0)).\n*   **Risk:** Moving to (9, 9) traps me in the corner for exactly one turn (next turn I must go DOWN). This is acceptable because I will be growing, and the subsequent position (9, 8) is open.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (9, 9) to eat the apple. This scores a point, puts me at 12 apples (closing the gap to 12-13), and sets me up on the right edge for further exploration.\n\nRIGHT",

It cannot move left into (7,9) because that's its own body; its realistic moves are RIGHT to (9,9) or DOWN to (8,8). It cannot contest (0,9) this turn, so no head-on risk moving LEFT.\n\nTactical assessment:\n- Taking (0,9) picks an apple and preserves the clean path down the 0-column to (0,8) and (0,7), which are apples as well. From that small sweep I can collect three apples and then use the cleared area to loop back into the board, keeping options open while watching the enemy push from the right. Moving DOWN now would be unnecessarily restrictive and risks getting funneled along my own body.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- LEFT to (0,9) now, then DOWN to (0,8) and (0,7) to collect that cluster. Afterward, head back into the interior to avoid being boxed, and monitor the enemy\u2019s movements toward the right-side apples (e.g., (9,9), (5,9)). Avoid narrow corridors near my own body.\n\nLEFT",

Update from Last Move:**\nMy move RIGHT was successful. I moved to (9, 9) and ate the apple.\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (9, 9).\n*   **New Body:** I grew by 1 segment. My tail (at 8, 1) was removed. My length is now 13.\n    *   Current Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1)].\n*   **Score Update:** My score is 12. Enemy score is 13.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1, 9). The enemy is likely to move LEFT to (0, 9) to eat the apple there. This will trap them in the corner at (0,9) or force them down into a confined space. This is ideal for me as it removes the enemy from the main playing area.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (9, 9). Top-right corner.\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (9, 10) is off board. **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (9, 8). Is (9, 8) occupied?\n        *   My body: [(9, 9), (8, 9)...]. (9, 8) is empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (8, 9). Is (8, 9) occupied?\n        *   Yes, (8, 9) is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (10, 9) is off board. **Fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy is at x=1. My x=9. No collision possible.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI am at (9, 9). My only valid safe move is **DOWN** to (9, 8).\n*   **DOWN to (9, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is a forced move to survive. I need to descend the right wall to access other apples (e.g., (8, 2), (8, 0), (5, 0)).\n    *   **Consequence:** From (9, 8), I can go DOWN (to 9,7) or LEFT (to 8,8). Both should be checked for safety next turn.\n\n**5. Long Term Strategy:**\nI am still trailing by 1 point (12 vs 13). I need to continue collecting apples efficiently.\n*   **Pathing:** I am committed to the right wall. My immediate path is (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6)...\n*   **Target:** I see an apple at (8, 2). To get there from the right wall, I will need to turn LEFT at some point. I should check the safety of (8, 2) and the path to it.\n    *   The board state shows (8, 2) is an apple.\n    *   Is (8, 2) safe? The board shows `A` at (8, 2).\n    *   Is the path safe? From (9, 2), I can go LEFT to (8, 2). But I need to reach (9, 2) first.\n    *   I must also watch out for the enemy. If the enemy moves down from (0,9) to (0,8), they are still far away.\n    *   My current body blocks (8, 9) and (7, 9). As I move down, (8, 9) and (7, 9) will shift. I need to ensure I don't trap myself.\n    *   Let's trace the path down to (9, 2):\n        *   (9, 9) -> (9, 8)\n        *   (9, 8) -> (9, 7)\n        *   (9, 7) -> (9, 6)\n        *   (9, 6) -> (9, 5)\n        *   (9, 5) -> (9, 4)\n        *   (9, 4) -> (9, 3)\n        *   (9, 3) -> (9, 2)\n        *   (9, 2) -> (8, 2) (Eat Apple)\n    *   The board state shows the right column (x=9) has `.` at rows 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. It is clear.\n    *   (8, 2) is an apple. (8, 2) is `.` in the board state map? Wait, the map shows `(8, 2)` is `A`. Yes.\n    *   (8, 2) is safe to move to? It is an apple. It is not a wall. It is not my body (I am at x=9).\n    *   Is there a risk of the enemy reaching (8, 2)? No, they are at x=0/1.\n    *   Is there a risk of my own body blocking me? As I move down, my tail follows. My body is vertical along x=9. I am safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nI must move **DOWN**. There are no other options. This continues my descent along the right wall toward the apple at (8, 2).\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

It cannot reach or contest (0,8) this turn or next few turns.\n- (0,8) is not occupied by any body segment, so moving there is safe this turn. I will eat an apple and grow by 1 (tail will not move this turn).\n\nTactical assessment:\n- Taking (0,8) continues the clean sweep down the left column where there are apples at (0,8) and (0,7) (and (0,0) elsewhere). This keeps me away from the crowded central corridors of my own body and the enemy on the right side.\n- Eating now is preferable to stalling: it increases my apple lead and gives me extra length to control space. After collecting the (0,8)/(0,7) cluster I will plan to re-enter the board interior from the cleared left column to avoid being funneled by my own body.\n- No head-on collision risk exists with the enemy for this move.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move to (0,8) to eat the apple, then continue to (0,7) to take that apple. After that, pivot back into the interior using the cleared column, avoiding tight corridors near my recent tail and monitoring the enemy\u2019s push on the right side for opportunities to claim more apples safely.\n\nDOWN",

My body currently occupies (7, 8) and (8, 9). If I enter (8, 8), I am surrounded by my own body on the left (7,8) and up (8,9). This is a tight spot.\n*   Sticking to the wall (DOWN) keeps my path clear. The right column (x=9) is completely empty down to y=2. This is the safest path.\n*   The apple at (8, 2) is reachable by going DOWN to (9, 2) and then LEFT.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (9, 7). This maintains my safe descent along the right wall towards the apple at (8, 2) and avoids the potentially dangerous tight space at (8, 8).\n\nDOWN",

I moved to (9, 7).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (9, 7).\n*   **New Body:** My tail (at (6, 2)) was removed. My length is still 13.\n    *   Current Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)].\n*   **Score Update:** My score is 12. Enemy score is 16 (Enemy likely ate an apple at (0, 7) or similar).\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0, 7). The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner. They have no immediate apples nearby except possibly moving down to (0,6) or (0,5) (which is an apple). Their movement is severely restricted. They are not a threat to me in the right-side area.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (9, 7). Right column.\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (9, 8). Is (9, 8) occupied? Yes, it is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (9, 6). Is (9, 6) occupied?\n        *   My body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)...]. (9, 6) is empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (8, 7). Is (8, 7) occupied?\n        *   My body: ... (7, 8) is in my body. (8, 7) is not listed. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (10, 7) is off board. **Fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy is at x=0. My x=9. No collision possible.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have two valid safe moves: **DOWN** to (9, 6) or **LEFT** to (8, 7).\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (9, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Continues descending the right wall towards the apple at (8, 2).\n    *   **Future Options:** From (9, 6), I can go DOWN (to 9,5) or LEFT (to 8,6). Both are likely safe.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me off the wall into the interior.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8, 7), I can go DOWN (to 8,6), LEFT (to 7,7), or RIGHT (to 9,7). I cannot go UP (to 8,8) because (8,8) is empty? Wait, checking my body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...]. (8, 8) is empty. However, (7, 8) is my body on the left. (9, 7) is my body on the right (will move). Actually, if I move LEFT to (8, 7), my old head position (9,7) becomes body. So if I am at (8, 7) next turn, I can go RIGHT to (9,7) which will be body (fatal). I can go UP to (8,8) (safe). I can go DOWN to (8,6) (safe). I can go LEFT to (7,7) (safe).\n    *   *Correction on self-collision logic:* If I move LEFT to (8, 7), my body becomes [(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)...]. So (9, 7) will be occupied. This means I cannot go RIGHT from (8, 7) next turn. But I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. So I have 3 options.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI need to reach the apple at (8, 2).\n*   If I go **DOWN** to (9, 6), I am getting closer to (9, 2) which is the turn before I can grab (8, 2).\n*   If I go **LEFT** to (8, 7), I am moving closer to the interior apples but potentially boxing myself in near my own body at (7, 8) and (9, 7).\n*   Sticking to the wall (DOWN) keeps my path clear. The right column (x=9) is completely empty down to y=2. This is the safest path.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (9, 6). This maintains my safe descent along the right wall towards the apple at (8, 2) and avoids the potentially dangerous tight space at (8, 7).\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

No immediate head-on threat if I move DOWN.\n- (0,6) is free of all bodies; moving DOWN will not eat an apple this turn so my tail (3,2) will vacate, keeping my length stable.\n- Moving RIGHT risks entering tight space formed by my own body; that increases chance of getting funneled and makes chasing bottom apples harder.\n- Moving DOWN keeps multiple follow-up moves available (I can continue down the left column to sweep (0,5)...(0,0)), safely collecting several apples (including (0,0)) while staying away from the enemy.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue down x=0 to collect the column apples, then re-enter the interior from x=1 near the bottom to gather (2,0) and nearby apples while watching enemy movements on the right. Avoid turning into my own body segments and keep paths open toward the bottom-left apples.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

After grabbing bottom apples, re-enter toward (2,0)/(2,0) and nearby apples, always watching enemy movement and avoiding turning into my own body.\n- Keep escape paths open by not cutting off my tail and by preferring moves that leave multiple follow-ups.\n\nDOWN",

Update from Last Move:**\nMy last move was DOWN to (9, 6).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (9, 6).\n*   **New Body:** My tail (at (6, 3)) was removed. My length is still 13.\n    *   Current Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)].\n*   **Score Update:** My score is 12. Enemy score is 16. No apples eaten this turn.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0, 6) (based on previous state).\n*   **Movement Prediction:** The enemy has many options in the bottom-left area (0,0) and (0,5), (1,5), etc. They are likely chasing apples in that quadrant. They are not a direct threat to me in the right column.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (9, 6). Right column.\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (9, 7). Is (9, 7) occupied? Yes, it is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (9, 5). Is (9, 5) occupied? My body is mostly at x=9, y>=6 or x=6. (9, 5) is empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (8, 6). Is (8, 6) occupied? My body does not contain (8, 6). **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (10, 6) is off board. **Fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy is far away. No collision possible this turn.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have two valid safe moves: **DOWN** to (9, 5) or **LEFT** to (8, 6).\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Continues descending the right wall.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (9, 5), I can go DOWN (to 9,4) or LEFT (to 8,5). Both are likely safe. This path is predictable and keeps the right side open.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me off the wall towards the interior.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8, 6), I can go DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), or UP (8,7). I cannot go RIGHT to (9,6) because that's my current head (which will be body). This move opens up access to the apple at (8, 5) and the interior cluster (7,5), (7,2), (8,2). However, I must be careful not to get boxed in by my own body at (9,6) and (9,7) if I turn left.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nThe apple at (8, 2) is a high-value target.\n*   If I stay on the **DOWN** path (9,5), I am on track to reach (9,2) or (9,1) and then turn LEFT to (8,2). This is a standard \"hugging the wall\" strategy.\n*   If I go **LEFT** to (8, 6), I am \"cutting the corner\". This puts me in the interior earlier, potentially allowing me to reach (8, 2) sooner by moving DOWN to (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) -> (8,2).\n*   However, moving LEFT now blocks my retreat to (9,6) in the future. But looking at the board, the space at (7,6) and (8,5) is open.\n*   The apple at (8, 5) is directly reachable from (8, 6) via DOWN.\n*   The apple at (7, 5) is also reachable via LEFT from (8, 5).\n\nComparing the two paths:\n1.  **Stick to Wall (Down):** (9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4)... -> (9,2) -> (8,2). Requires ~4 moves + 1 turn.\n2.  **Interior (Left):** (9,6) -> (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) -> (8,2). Requires ~4 moves + 1 turn.\n\nThey are roughly equivalent in distance. However, the interior path (Left) allows me to eat the apple at (8, 5) along the way. The wall path (Down) forces me to pass (9,5) (empty) and (9,4) (empty) before reaching the target.\nFurthermore, the board state shows (7,5) and (7,2) are apples. Being at (8,6) places me closer to this cluster than (9,6) does.\n\nThe risk with moving LEFT is the \"self-trap\" potential. If I go to (8,6), my body will be [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7)...]. Next turn, I can go DOWN (safe), LEFT (safe), or UP (safe, as (8,7) is empty). I cannot go RIGHT. This is 3 options, which is acceptable.\nIf I stay at (9,5), I have 2 options (DOWN/LEFT). Both are safe.\n\nDecision: I will move **LEFT** to (8, 6). This move accelerates my approach to the apple cluster at (8, 5) and (7, 5) and provides more flexibility than sticking to the wall, provided I don't immediately box myself in. I will proceed carefully down the interior column.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

State Update:**\nMy last move was **LEFT** to (8, 6).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (8, 6).\n*   **New Body:** The tail was removed. My length is still 13.\n    *   Current Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\n*   **Score:** My score is 12. Enemy score is 16.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 (Head at (0, 5)) is still in the bottom-left quadrant.\n*   **Threat Assessment:** The enemy is far away. The leftmost column of the board (x=0) is occupied by the enemy body or walls. The bottom-left corner is a congested zone for the enemy, but I am safe at (8,6).\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (8, 6).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (8, 7). Is (8, 7) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (8, 5). Is (8, 5) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (7, 6). Is (7, 6) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (9, 6). Is (9, 6) occupied? Yes, it is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:** None. Enemy is at x=0.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have three valid safe moves: **UP**, **DOWN**, and **LEFT**.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8,7), I can go UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), or LEFT (7,7).\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves away from the apples at (8,5) and (7,5). While (8,8) is empty, there are no immediate high-value targets in that direction. This would be a \"treading water\" move.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7,6), I can go UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5), or LEFT (6,6).\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me deeper into the board. (7,5) is an apple. (6,6) is currently part of my body (tail area), but by the time I get there, it might be clear. This path leads towards the apple at (7,5) and eventually (7,2). However, it also takes me further from the apple at (8,5) and potentially cuts off my route back to the right wall.\n\n*   **Option 3: DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** **Apple!** (8, 5) is listed in the apples.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This move secures an apple point immediately.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8, 5) (after eating), I will have length 14.\n        *   **UP:** (8, 6) - My current head location. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN:** (8, 4) - Empty. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT:** (7, 5) - **Apple!** (7, 5) is listed.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (9, 5) - Empty. Safe.\n    *   **Analysis:** This move yields an immediate point and offers a \"kill box\" setup. From (8, 5), I can turn LEFT to eat (7, 5) next. This is a highly efficient path. Even if I miss (7, 5), I have four safe exits from (8, 5).\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nThe choice between LEFT (to 7,6) and DOWN (to 8,5) is critical.\n*   Going **LEFT** to (7,6) positions me to eat (7,5) eventually, but I bypass (8,5) for now. If I go (7,6) -> (7,5), I am at (7,5). From there, my body surrounds me on the right (8,6) and below/left (6,6, etc.). My future options from (7,5) would be restricted.\n*   Going **DOWN** to (8,5) eats the apple immediately. More importantly, from (8,5), I can go LEFT to (7,5) *next* turn. This sequence (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (7,5) allows me to eat two apples in rapid succession.\n*   Furthermore, staying at x=8 keeps me close to the right wall (x=9), maintaining a safer boundary. The interior (x=6,7) is currently blocked by my own body.\n\n**Decision:** I will move **DOWN** to (8, 5). This guarantees an apple, maximizes future move flexibility (4 safe moves from 8,5), and sets up a chain move to the apple at (7, 5). The score is 12 to 16; I need to close the gap, and eating two apples quickly is the best way to do that.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

State Update:**\nMy last move was **DOWN** to (8, 5).\n*   **New Position:** My head is at (8, 5).\n*   **New Body:** The tail was removed. My length is still 14.\n    *   Current Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\n*   **Score:** My score is 13. Enemy score is 16.\n*   **Apple Status:** (8, 5) has been eaten.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 (Head at (0, 4)) is still in the bottom-left quadrant.\n*   **Threat Assessment:** The enemy is far away. The leftmost column of the board (x=0) is occupied by the enemy body or walls. The bottom-left corner is a congested zone for the enemy, but I am safe at (8,5).\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (8, 5).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (8, 6). Is (8, 6) occupied? Yes, it is the second segment of my body. **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (8, 4). Is (8, 4) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (7, 5). Is (7, 5) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (9, 5). Is (9, 5) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:** None. Enemy is at x=0.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have three valid safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8,4), I can go UP (8,5) (safe, body moves), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4), or RIGHT (9,4).\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me away from the immediate apples. (8,4) is empty and safe, but it doesn't secure a point immediately. I am currently in a good position to eat the apple at (7,5).\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** **Apple!** (7, 5) is listed in the apples.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This move secures an apple point immediately.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7, 5) (after eating), I will have length 15.\n        *   **UP:** (7, 6) - Empty (my tail moves from (6,4) to (6,5), but (7,6) remains empty). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN:** (7, 4) - Empty. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT:** (6, 5) - Empty (as above). Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (8, 5) - My previous head location (will be safe as my body moves).\n    *   **Analysis:** This move yields an immediate point. From (7,5), I have access to (7,4), (7,6), and (6,5), keeping options open. This is the most efficient path to closing the score gap (13 vs 16).\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the right wall.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (9,5), I can go UP (9,6) (occupied by my body, fatal), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5) (safe), or RIGHT (off board).\n    *   **Analysis:** While safe, (9,5) is a \"corner\" state for me. I can only go DOWN or LEFT. (9,6) is occupied by my body (currently (9,6), but since I'm moving, the body shifts; however, (9,6) will still be occupied by the segment that was (8,6) or similar). Actually, looking at my current body: [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6)...]. If I move RIGHT to (9,5), my new body is [(9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6)...]. So (9,6) is definitely occupied. (9,4) is empty. This is a suboptimal move compared to LEFT as it limits future mobility and doesn't grab an apple.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI am positioned perfectly to eat the apple at (7, 5).\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (7, 5) guarantees a point and sets up a flexible position for the next turn.\n*   Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) is a \"dead end\" move (only 2 safe exits, one is an apple at (9,3) which is far).\n*   Moving DOWN to (8, 4) misses the immediate apple and moves me away from the cluster at (7,2)-(8,2).\n\n**Decision:** I will move **LEFT** to (7, 5). This maximizes points gained per turn and keeps my future options wide open. I need to catch up to the enemy score of 16, and eating apples is the priority.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Yes, it is my previous head location (which becomes part of my body). **Fatal.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:** None. Enemy is at x=0.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have two valid safe moves: **UP** and **DOWN**.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7, 6), I can go UP (7, 7), DOWN (7, 5) (safe as body moves), LEFT (6, 6) (occupied by body, fatal), or RIGHT (8, 6) (occupied by body, fatal).\n    *   **Analysis:** While safe, (7, 6) effectively traps me. I would be forced to go UP or DOWN (back to where I came from). It blocks my left and right exits immediately. This limits my mobility significantly.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7, 4), I can go UP (7, 5) (safe as body moves), DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4) (occupied by my tail, safe as tail moves), or RIGHT (8, 4).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the superior move.\n        *   **Apple Proximity:** (7, 4) puts me adjacent to the apple at (7, 3). I can eat it next turn if I move DOWN again.\n        *   **Mobility:** From (7, 4), I have open paths in 3 directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). LEFT is blocked by my tail, but the tail will move away next turn, opening that path up shortly.\n        *   **Comparison:** Unlike (7, 6) which restricts me immediately, (7, 4) keeps my future options wide open and moves me towards a cluster of apples (7, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2).\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI am in a tight spot at (7, 5) with only two safe moves. Moving UP to (7, 6) is a trap that limits my next move to only vertical options. Moving DOWN to (7, 4) keeps my path flexible and targets an immediate apple at (7, 3). To catch up to the enemy score (14 vs 16), I must prioritize safe access to apples. Therefore, I must move DOWN.\n\n**Decision:** I will move **DOWN** to (7, 4). This avoids trapping myself and sets me up to eat the apple at (7, 3) on the next turn.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

State Update:**\nMy last move was **DOWN** to (7, 4).\n*   **New Position:** My head is now at (7, 4).\n*   **New Body:** The tail was removed. My length is 15.\n    *   Current Body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)].\n*   **Apple Status:** No apple at (7, 4). Score remains 14.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 (Head at (0, 2)) is moving Left to (0, 1) or Up to (0, 3) or Right to (1, 2).\n*   **Threat Assessment:** Still far away in the bottom-left corner. No immediate danger.\n*   **Potential Head-on Collision:** My potential moves are UP (7, 5), DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4). The enemy is at x=0. Risk is negligible.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (7, 4).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 5). Is (7, 5) occupied? Yes, it is my body (currently (7, 5)). **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 3). Is (7, 3) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 4). Is (6, 4) occupied? Yes, it is my tail (currently (6, 5)). **Safe** (tail moves away).\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 4). Is (8, 4) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:** None.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have three valid safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** Contains an **APPLE** at (7, 3).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7, 3), I can go UP (7, 4) (safe), DOWN (7, 2) (safe), LEFT (6, 3) (safe), or RIGHT (8, 3) (safe).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a strong move. It grabs an apple immediately, increases my score to 15 (closing the gap to the enemy's 16), and guarantees growth, which is crucial for survival and length. It leaves me with 3 open directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) since UP leads back to my previous head (which will be my neck).\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (6, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (6, 4), I can go UP (6, 5) (occupied by tail, safe as tail moves), DOWN (6, 3) (safe), LEFT (5, 4) (contains apple), or RIGHT (7, 4) (occupied by body, fatal).\n    *   **Analysis:** This moves me towards the apple at (5, 4) but doesn't grab it immediately. However, (5, 4) is occupied by an apple, but moving to it requires reaching (5, 4) on a subsequent turn. It is a slower approach.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8, 4), I can go UP (8, 5) (occupied by body, fatal), DOWN (8, 3) (safe), LEFT (7, 4) (occupied by body, fatal), or RIGHT (9, 4) (safe).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a dangerous move. It leaves me with only 2 safe directions (DOWN and RIGHT). I would be sandwiched between my own body at (8, 5) and the wall at (9, 4), effectively trapping myself in a corner. This limits my mobility severely and should be avoided.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI am in a position to eat an apple immediately at (7, 3). Catching up to the enemy (14 vs 16) is the priority, and grabbing an apple now is the most efficient way to do so.\n*   Moving **DOWN** secures the apple and maintains good mobility (3 safe exits).\n*   Moving **LEFT** is safe but slower to secure the apple at (5, 4).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** is dangerous and restricts future movement.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is **DOWN** to eat the apple.\n\n**Decision:** I will move **DOWN** to (7, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 3) to reach score 15. From (7, 3), I will likely move DOWN to (7, 2) or LEFT to (6, 3) to target the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board ((8, 2), (7, 2), (5, 1), etc.). I must remain vigilant of the enemy's position but prioritize my own survival and growth.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head (7,4) is far and cannot contest these squares this turn.\n- RIGHT (1,2) moves into the interior toward apple clusters, but that also edges me closer to the loop of my own body near the top-left.

Staying on the edge reduces immediate trapping risk; because I won\u2019t eat on this move, my tail will advance and preserve escape space behind me.\n\nShort plan (next turns):\n- Move to (0,1) now, then (0,0) to pick that apple.\n- After eating (0,0), sweep east along y=0 to collect (2,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(8,0) as feasible, using tail movement to avoid self-trapping.\n- Keep monitoring enemy head; avoid tight turns into my top-left loop and yield contested apples if a head-on risk appears.\n\nDecision: choose the safe route to collect the bottom apples.\n\nDOWN",

State Update:**\nMy last move was **DOWN** to (7, 3).\n*   **New Position:** My head is now at (7, 3).\n*   **New Body:** I ate the apple at (7, 3). The tail remains at (6, 6) because I grew. My length is now 16.\n    *   Current Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)].\n*   **Apple Status:** I collected the apple at (7, 3). Score is now 15.\n*   **Turn Info:** Turn 42/150.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 (Head at (0, 1)) is moving.\n*   **Threat Assessment:** Far away in the bottom-left corner. The bottom-left is getting crowded by the enemy, but I am safe at x=7. No immediate danger.\n*   **Potential Head-on Collision:** I am at x=7. The enemy is at x=0. Collisions are impossible this turn.\n\n**3. Immediate Survival Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** (7, 3).\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 4). Is (7, 4) occupied? Yes, it is my neck (currently (7, 4)). **Fatal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 2). Is (7, 2) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 3). Is (6, 3) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 3). Is (8, 3) occupied? No. **Safe.**\n*   **Enemy Collision:** None.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nI have three valid safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   **Target:** Contains an **APPLE** at (7, 2).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (7, 2), I can go UP (7, 3) (safe, will be neck), DOWN (7, 1) (safe), LEFT (6, 2) (safe), or RIGHT (8, 2) (contains apple).\n    *   **Analysis:** Strong move. Secures an apple immediately, increasing score to 16 (matching the enemy). Offers high mobility with 4 safe directions (3 unique excluding back).\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (6, 3), I can go UP (6, 4) (safe), DOWN (6, 2) (safe), LEFT (5, 3) (safe), or RIGHT (7, 3) (safe, will be neck).\n    *   **Analysis:** Safe but doesn't secure an apple immediately. I would have to reach for (6, 2) or (5, 1) later. Slower growth.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8, 3), I can go UP (8, 4) (safe), DOWN (8, 2) (contains apple), LEFT (7, 3) (safe, will be neck), or RIGHT (9, 3) (safe).\n    *   **Analysis:** Safe and moves toward an apple at (8, 2). However, the path is slightly more restricted due to the board edge at x=9 and my body at (9,6) and above. It is a good move, but DOWN offers an apple *now* and potentially opens up a wider vertical range.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI need to catch up to the enemy (currently trailing by 1 apple, 15 vs 16).\nMoving **DOWN** to (7, 2) guarantees an apple consumption immediately. This brings my score to 16, leveling the playing field.\nFurthermore, from (7, 2), I have access to (7, 1) (down), (6, 2) (left), and (8, 2) (right). The cluster of apples at the bottom of the board ((8,2), (5,1), etc.) is accessible from here.\nMoving LEFT is safe but slower. Moving RIGHT is good, but DOWN is the most aggressive and rewarding move.\n\n**Decision:** I will move **DOWN** to eat the apple at (7, 2).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 2) to reach score 16 (tying the enemy). From (7, 2), I will assess the board. The bottom row has several apples ((6,0), (5,0), (8,0), (2,0), (4,0)). I should consider moving towards (6, 1) or (6, 0) next, or continue sweeping the area if the enemy remains confined to the left side. I must ensure I don't get trapped against the left wall (x=0) or my own body.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Eating increases my length this turn, but (0,0) is not occupied by any body, so no immediate self-collision. The enemy head is far (7,3) and cannot contest (0,0) this turn, so a head-on risk is negligible.\n- Taking the apple at (0,0) enables the planned sweep east along y=0 to gather the row of apples (2,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(8,0) while using my tail movement to avoid self-trapping. That keeps me on the board edge (fewer risky tight turns) and builds my lead (16 vs 14).\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (0,0) now, then proceed east along y=0 to pick up bottom-row apples, monitoring the enemy's approach and avoiding moves that close off escape routes. Stay aware of potential head-on contests for apples further east and yield if a collision risk appears.\n\nDecision: move DOWN to take the apple at (0,0).\n\nDOWN",

Is (7, 1) occupied?\n        *   It is NOT in the current body list.\n        *   It is NOT in the enemy body list.\n        *   It is on the board (y=1 is valid). **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 2). Is (6, 2) occupied?\n        *   It is NOT in the current body list.\n        *   It is NOT in the enemy body list.\n        *   It is on the board. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 2). Is (8, 2) occupied?\n        *   It is NOT in the current body list.\n        *   It is NOT in the enemy body list (Enemy is at x=0-3).\n        *   It is on the board. **SAFE.**\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\nValid moves: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (7, 1):**\n    *   **Target:** Contains an **APPLE** at (7, 1).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving here allows me to consume an apple immediately, increasing my score to 17 (tying the enemy).\n    *   **Safety:** From (7, 1), I can retreat UP (7, 2), go LEFT (6, 1) (has apple), or RIGHT (8, 1) (has apple). This position is highly flexible and keeps me in the rich bottom row.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Target:** Empty.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me toward the apple at (6, 1) and (5, 1) and the cluster at (5, 0), (6, 0), (4, 0). Good for sweeping the bottom right quadrant.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Provides access to DOWN (6, 1) or LEFT (5, 2).\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Target:** Contains an **APPLE** at (8, 2).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Eating here also brings my score to 17.\n    *   **Safety:** From (8, 2), I can go DOWN (8, 1) (has apple), LEFT (7, 2) (safe, will be neck), or UP (8, 3). However, moving to the right edge (x=8) reduces maneuvering space for future turns compared to staying near the center-left (x=6,7).\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nMy score is 16, enemy is 17. I need to eat.\nBoth **DOWN** and **RIGHT** offer apples.\n**DOWN to (7, 1)** is the superior choice over **RIGHT to (8, 2)** for two reasons:\n1.  **Escape Routes:** (7, 1) offers excellent exits (Left to (6,1) which has an apple, Right to (8,1) which has an apple, Down to (7,0) which is open). (8, 2) forces me closer to the board edge (x=9), limiting my right-side maneuvering space.\n2.  **Trap Avoidance:** Staying centered (x=7) is generally safer than pushing to the edge unless the edge offers a specific, critical advantage. Here, the center offers multiple apple targets.\n\nI will move **DOWN** to eat the apple at (7, 1), tieing the score at 17-17.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nTie the score (17-17). From (7, 1), analyze the board for the next apple. The bottom row is dense with food ((6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (2,0)). I need to sweep this row efficiently while keeping an eye on the enemy's movement. Since the enemy is at x=0, I own the right side of the board.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No enemy head can contest (1,0) this turn (enemy head at (7,2) is far away).\n- Moving to (1,0) preserves my ability to sweep east along y=0 to pick up apples at (2,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(8,0). Moving now into an empty cell means my tail will move and I won't grow this turn, which helps avoid immediate self-trap.\n- I must monitor the enemy\u2019s approach: they are on the right/top side and unlikely to reach the bottom row quickly, but if they head down the right side they could contest apples near x=8\u20136 later. Prioritize nearby apples and keep open escape routes (don\u2019t box myself into the top-left).\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (1,0), then take (2,0) next turn (apple). Continue east along row 0 collecting apples while watching for enemy movement; if enemy starts moving toward the bottom row, yield to avoid risky head-on collisions and instead use my long body to patrol/box off space safely.\n\nRIGHT",

From here, I can move UP to (8, 1) or LEFT to (7, 0) (my old tail position, which will move). Moving to the edge of the board reduces future maneuverability and risks trapping myself if the enemy or walls close in.\n    *   **Decision:** Safe but restricts movement.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 0):**\n    *   **Occupancy:** (6, 0) is empty.\n    *   **Apple:** (6, 0) has an apple (Row 0, Col 6 shows 'A').\n    *   **Score:** Eating this apple increases my score to 17, keeping me close behind the enemy (18-17).\n    *   **Future Safety:** From (6, 0), I can move UP to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 0). This keeps me in the bottom row, which is dense with apples ((5, 0), (4, 0), (2, 0)) but also bordered by walls and enemy territory. However, accessing these apples is crucial for catching up.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** The apple at (6, 0) is the closest available food. Securing it immediately is the best play to maintain score pressure. The enemy is at (2, 0) and likely moving away or trapped, so the immediate collision risk is low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT is the optimal move. It eats an apple, maintains a clear path to other bottom-row apples, and avoids the immediate dead-ends of UP/DOWN. While RIGHT also eats an apple, (6, 0) is safer long-term because it keeps the center column (x=7) open for retreat or lateral movement, whereas (8, 0) traps me against the right wall.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Their only legal moves are LEFT to (6,0) or RIGHT to (8,0) (UP is into their neck, DOWN is off-board). They will be contesting apples on y=0 (6,0 and 8,0) this turn.\n- RIGHT to (3,0) keeps me on y=0 and allows me to reach (4,0) on the next turn (apple at (4,0)), which is closer than the enemy (I need 2 moves to reach (4,0), enemy needs 3 moves if they go left). That lets me collect bottom-row apples quickly and deny them to the opponent.\n- UP to (2,1) gets an apple now (apple at (2,1)), which is safe and useful, but it slows my ability to contest the dense cluster of apples on y=0 (4,0,5,0,6,0,8,0). Given the enemy is already on y=0 near those apples, staying on the bottom row and racing to 4,0 gives a tempo advantage.\n- No immediate head-on risk exists if I move RIGHT: the enemy cannot reach (3,0) this turn. Moving RIGHT also keeps options open (next turn I can go to (4,0) apple or go up into open space at x=3 if needed).\n\nShort plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (3,0) now, then take (4,0) on the next turn. From there, proceed to gather (5,0) and (6,0) as practical, while watching whether the enemy commits left toward those apples or goes right. If the enemy pushes down aggressively, use my longer body and available room to peel off upward and avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Current Situation Analysis:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - **Head:** (6, 0)\n  - **Body:** `[(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)]`\n  - **Score:** 17 apples.\n  - **Previous Move:** Moved LEFT to (6, 0) to eat an apple.\n\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** (3, 0)\n  - **Body:** `[(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7)]`\n  - **Score:** 18 apples.\n\n- **Apples:** The board contains 15 apples. Key apples near the bottom include (5, 0), (4, 0), and (2, 0).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from Head (6, 0)):**\nI must check all four directions for safety and strategic value.\n\n- **DOWN (6, -1):**\n  - **Safety:** Off the board (y < 0).\n  - **Result:** **INVALID (Death)**.\n\n- **UP (6, 1):**\n  - **Safety:** The coordinate (6, 1) is not listed in my body.\n  - **Occupancy:** The board state indicates `.` (empty) at (6, 1).\n  - **Enemy Risk:** Snake #0 is at (3, 0). A head-on collision is only possible if the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 0) and I move UP to (6, 1), or if the enemy moves UP to (3, 1) and I... wait, distance is large. The enemy's direct collision vector with me is if they move to (6, 0) or (6, 1). (6, 0) is my current head. If they move there, they die (head-to-body). If they move to (6, 1), they don't die immediately, but that's a significant distance for them to cover in one turn. (Distance is > 10 blocks).\n  - **Future Options:** From (6, 1), I can move UP (6, 2), LEFT (5, 1), RIGHT (7, 1), or DOWN (back to 6, 0). (7, 1) is currently my body, but by the next turn, (7, 1) will be empty (since my tail moves from (6, 7) to (6, 6) if I don't grow). *Correction:* If I move UP, I do not eat an apple (assuming no apple at 6,1). My tail moves. (7, 0) will be empty next turn. (7, 1) will be occupied by my body (segment 2). So (7, 1) will be a wall. However, (5, 1) has an apple. (6, 2) is currently empty. (6, 1) is safe.\n\n- **LEFT (5, 0):**\n  - **Safety:** (5, 0) is empty (`.`).\n  - **Apple:** YES. (5, 0) is an apple.\n  - **Enemy Risk:** Snake #0 is at (3, 0). If they move RIGHT to (4, 0), they are safe. If they move RIGHT twice... no, they move one step. They cannot reach (5, 0) in one turn. Collision is impossible.\n  - **Future Options:** Eating here grows my snake. My body will extend. The tail will not move this turn. My body currently ends at (6, 7). If I eat, I grow, so the tail stays at (6, 7) or effectively my length increases. The cell behind me is (7, 0). (7, 0) is currently occupied by my body. If I move LEFT, (7, 0) remains occupied. The cell (7, 0) is NOT the tail. My tail is at (6, 7). So (7, 0) is a safe cell to move into? No, wait. My head is at (6, 0). My body is `[(7, 0)...]`. The cell immediately behind my head is (7, 0). Moving LEFT to (5, 0) does not move into (7, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7, 0) would be moving backwards into myself. Moving LEFT is safe from self-collision.\n  - **Board Position:** (5, 0) is adjacent to (4, 0) (apple) and (5, 1) (apple). It keeps me in the bottom row.\n\n- **RIGHT (7, 0):**\n  - **Safety:** (7, 0) is occupied by my own body (specifically, the segment immediately connected to my previous head position).\n  - **Result:** **INVALID (Death)**. Moving backwards into your own body is fatal.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n- **Comparison of Safe Moves (UP vs LEFT):**\n  - **LEFT to (5, 0):** This move guarantees an apple (+1 point), putting my score at 18, tying with the enemy. It opens up apples at (4, 0) and (5, 1) for the next turn. It keeps me grounded at y=0, which is generally safer from walls but limits vertical escape routes. However, given the density of apples at y=0 (4,0, 2,0), this is highly profitable.\n  - **UP to (6, 1):** This move does not yield an apple immediately. It moves me into the open space. While (6, 1) is safe, (5, 1) is an apple that I could potentially go for later. However, moving UP puts me closer to the center of the board where the enemy snake's tail and body are located (specifically the snake occupies x=0-3 for most of the vertical length). Staying on the bottom row keeps me away from the main body of snake #0, which occupies the left side and center-left (up to x=3).\n\n- **Enemy Prediction:**\n  - Snake #0 is at (3, 0). Apples are at (4, 0), (2, 0), and (5, 0). If Snake #0 moves to (4, 0), they might eat an apple. If they stay at (3, 0) or move to (2, 0), they might eat. They are in a very tight spot. If they move to (4, 0), they are safe. If they move UP to (3, 1), they are safe but hit their own tail? No, their body goes down to (2, 0). (3, 1) is empty. They have many options. However, my move to (5, 0) is safe regardless of their immediate move because they cannot reach (5, 0) in one turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT is the superior move. It guarantees a point (tying the score 18-18) and sets up immediate access to another apple at (4, 0) for the next turn. Moving UP wastes a turn collecting no points while the enemy is likely scoring.\n\nLEFT",

I have moved to (5, 0) (based on previous step logic) and need to secure the apple at (4, 0) immediately. This will tie my score with the enemy at 19. The enemy is blocked from eating this apple if I take it this turn. I must also watch the enemy's movement: if they move UP to (4, 1), they stay safe but miss the apple. If they stay or move elsewhere, I will be one step closer to closing the gap. After securing (4, 0), my priority will be to navigate around the bottom of the board to reach the other apples at (2, 0) and (8, 0) while avoiding the enemy's body, which spans the left side of the board. My body is currently filling the right side of the board, so I have maneuvering room in the center and left.\n\n**Decision process:**\n\n1.  **Current State Analysis:**\n    *   My Head: (5, 0) (Assumed from previous move choice LEFT from (6, 0)).\n    *   Enemy Head: (4, 0).\n    *   Apples at (4, 0) and (2, 0).\n    *   Score: 18 vs 19.

The enemy at (4, 0) can move to (4, 1) or (5, 0) (safe for them). If I go UP, I lose the opportunity to eat the apple at (4, 0) this turn. This is a passive move while trailing in score.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n        *   Safety: (4, 0) contains an apple. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy body (enemy head is there, but simultaneous movement means I occupy it only if I survive).\n        *   Enemy Collision: The enemy is currently at (4, 0). If the enemy moves to (4, 1), (3, 0), or (5, 0), we do not collide. If the enemy stays at (4, 0), we collide (head-on). However, staying at (4, 0) is risky for the enemy because (4, 0) is a corner with few exits (up to (4,1), left is (3,0) which is safe, right is (5,0) which is empty). The enemy is likely to move to an apple or an open space.\n        *   Outcome: If safe, I eat the apple (score 19) and grow. This ties the score. This is the highest priority move to close the gap.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 0):**\n        *   Safety: (6, 0) is empty (previously occupied by me, now empty).\n        *   Outcome: No apple. Passes up the chance to eat (4, 0). The enemy could move to (4, 0) or (5, 0).\n    *   **DOWN to (5, -1):**\n        *   Safety: Off the board. Death.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I am trailing by 1 apple. I must take risks to eat apples.\n    *   The apple at (4, 0) is the most critical target. It is adjacent to my head.\n    *   While there is a collision risk with the enemy snake at (4, 0), the enemy has other options. If the enemy moves UP to (4, 1) or LEFT to (3, 0), I survive and gain an apple.\n    *   If I do not move LEFT, the enemy is very likely to move LEFT to (3, 0) or UP to (4, 1), or perhaps RIGHT to (5, 0). If the enemy moves to (5, 0), they would have to traverse through (5, 0) which is currently empty.\n    *   The risk of head-on collision exists, but the reward of tying the score is necessary for a win. Playing passively (UP) while trailing guarantees I stay behind.\n    *   Therefore, the calculated risk is to move LEFT.\n\n4.  **Elimination:**\n    *   DOWN is fatal.\n    *   RIGHT and UP are safe but passive, allowing the enemy to score or maintain the lead.\n    *   LEFT offers a high reward (tying score) with a manageable collision risk.\n\n**Move Choice:**\nLEFT",
