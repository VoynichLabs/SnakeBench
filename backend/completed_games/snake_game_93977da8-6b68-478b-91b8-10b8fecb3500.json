Board\u2019s littered with apples like a buffet, but forget grazin' \u2013 we're huntin' growth to DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst off, scoutin' my moves: UP to (2,4)? Safe, empty, heads north. DOWN to (2,2)? Clear path, straight fire. LEFT to (1,3)? Open lane. RIGHT to (3,3)? No sweat. Enemy's too far to collide this turn \u2013 he can't teleport here, chat! \ud83d\ude02 All four are safe, no board edges or body BS to worry 'bout. But we ain't just survivin'; we're THRIVIN'!\n\nNow, the real tea: Closest apple's beggin' at (2,1) \u2013 just TWO steps DOWN! Why waste time? DOWN gets me closer, manhattan-style, without boxin' myself in. UP? Nah, that's detour city to farther fruits. LEFT or RIGHT? They'd swing me wide, exposin' flanks while enemy creeps left maybe. We're ruthless, chat \u2013 grow FAST, block his lanes LATER! If he dives for (8,0) or whatever, we'll circle back and trap him. Who's ready to see him CRASH? \ud83d\ude4c\n\nQuick strat note for next turn: Lock in that (2,1) apple for the grow, stay mobile around row 2-3 to flank if enemy pushes center.

LET\u2019S CHECK** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f  \n- **UP \u2192 (8,\u202f5)** \u2013 clears a path to the top\u2011right apple at (8,\u202f8) in three hops. Not bad, but it\u2019s a longer trek and the upper wall gives less wiggle room if the enemy gets sneaky.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,\u202f3)** \u2013 slides straight toward **(8,\u202f2)**, an apple that sits just two squares away. *Two moves and we\u2019re +1!* That\u2019s the fastest score\u2011boost I\u2019ve seen. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,\u202f4)** \u2013 sets up a clean shot at **(7,\u202f3)** after one down\u2011step. Still two moves, but I lose the delicious (8,\u202f0) apple waiting at the bottom\u2011right.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,\u202f4)** \u2013 pushes us out of the way, but the right edge offers zero future fruit. Also, we\u2019d be bordering the wall, limiting escape routes if the enemy ever tries to box us.  \n\n\ud83e\udded **Why DOWN is the *smashing* pick** \ud83e\udded  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Immediate apple access** \u2013 after this turn, a quick down move will land on **(8,\u202f2)** and net a +1 point.

Right now we\u2019re free on the right, but keeping the *right\u2011hand* path open is a classic \u201calways have a way out\u201d rule.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Enemy isolation** \u2013 Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head sits at (2,\u202f2), three rows below us.

Harvest the column\u202f8 cluster, then expand left when safe.

Enemy scrub #0 still a sad singleton at (8,3), no body, zero points \u2013 he's just floatin' out east like a lost noob, but we're 'bout to snowball this lead into a total lockdown! No way he's touchin' us this turn; his max reach is like (7-9,2-4), nowhere near our left-center vibe. Simultaneous moves mean zero collision risk right now \u2013 board's wide open for domination.\n\nScannin' the plays like a predator: UP to (2,2)? Straight into my own body \u2013 instant self-sabotage, we're not that dumb, chat! DEAD. DOWN to (2,0)? Safe as houses, empty cell on the bottom edge, keeps us low and mobile, but no apple \u2013 survivin' ain't thrivin'. LEFT to (1,1)? Also empty and in bounds, swings us west toward that (0,2) or (1,5) fruit later, opens flank options without trap risks. RIGHT to (3,1)? BOOM \u2013 direct hit on that juicy apple at (3,1)! Eat it, grow to length 3, score jumps to 2-0, and now we've got even more body to block his ass from the center. No own-body clash, no edge suicide, and enemy can't swoop in same-time. All safe moves keep future paths open \u2013 no dead-ends here at y=1 x=2.\n\nBut chat, we're not here to tiptoe \u2013 we're HERE TO CRUSH! RIGHT grabs the apple IMMEDIATE, bulkin' us up FAST while he's still snackless. Growth = board control = trappin' him against the east wall later. Imagine forcin' him left into our expanding territory? Head-on if he gets cocky, but with my lead, I win that KO. LEFT or DOWN? Meh, they delay the feast, lettin' him maybe snag (7,3) or (8,2) first \u2013 nah, we starve him out by monopolizin' the low-center apples! This sets up ruthless aggression: post-eat at (3,1) with body snakin' back to (2,1)-(2,2), next turn push RIGHT or UP to chase (4,1) empty or (3,2) clear, loop south-east to intercept his westward creep. Grow to 3+ quick, then mirror his moves mid-board to box him into corners. If he dives for (7,1), we claim row 1 dominance and force him north into apples we can steal. No mercy \u2013 this fool's crashin' by turn 10, who's with me?! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude4c\n\nQuick strat note for future me: After RIGHT feast, prioritize UP/RIGHT to expand east into his zone, grow to length 4+ by hittin' (3,9)? Nah, stick low: target (1,5) loop if he stays east, or RIGHT chain to (4,1)-(5,1) empties for safe grow. Always check body trail for self-block, and predict his left push to collide heads if scores favor us. Dominate rows 0-3!\n\nRIGHT",

It pushes us onto the outermost column, instantly giving us a \u201cone\u2011way\u201d sprint lane. If the opponent ever tries to force a corner we can zap back to safety by moving **UP** or **DOWN** from the edge. \ud83d\udcc8  \n\n- **Rival\u2019s next\u2011head possibilities** \u2013 they can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT would suicide). Their new head cells are (5,2), (5,0), or (6,1). None match our three safe destinations, so no head\u2011on clash this turn.  \n- **Future flexibility** \u2013 after grabbing (9,4) we still have three safe directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) in the next turn, whereas staying interior would quickly narrow us down to one or two viable paths as we grow. \ud83c\udf3f  \n\n**Why \u201cRIGHT\u201d outshines the others?**  \n- **Score parity:** we\u2019re tied at 2 points, and we\u2019ll be a cell ahead if we snag the next apple quickly.  \n- **Escape utility:** the right wall is a \u201chigh\u2011way\u201d you can run down forever; it\u2019s a buffer against any attempt by the enemy to corral us.  \n- **Future domino effect:** once we\u2019re flush against the wall we can clear the top\u2011row apples while keeping our body length in the rightmost column, gradually pushing the rival toward the left edge where they\u2019ll either bump into our tail or bite their own. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude80  \n\n**RIGHT**",

Both keep the wall open on the right and open the left side for next\u2011turn maneuvering.  \n- **Apple\u2011rush ahead:** The apple at (8,\u202f8) is just three squares away (up\u2011up\u2011left). By racing up the wall we\u2019ll be in a perfect position to snag it on turn\u202f7 while Snake\u202f#1 is still mulling over a right\u2011hand apple. More points \u2192 higher chance of a head\u2011on later when we have the lead.  \n- **Pressure on the rival:** Snake\u202f#1 can only go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. RIGHT gives them an apple at (7,\u202f1) but also makes them a long, straight line that we can **cut across** from the top\u2011right corner on our next leftward dash. Down would keep us in the same y\u2011lane as them, making a head\u2011on impossible to force.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcca Score snapshot:** 2\u20112. We\u2019re tied, so safety\u202f+\u202fapple\u2011grab are the top priorities.

If we head LEFT we snag it instantly, grow +1, and our score jumps from 3\ufe0f\u20e3 to 4\ufe0f\u20e3. That extra segment will later give us the breathing room we need to out\u2011maneuver #1\u2019s vertical line.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **\ud83d\udd04 Keep the future pathways wide open.**  \n- By moving LEFT we stay on the **y\u202f=\u202f9** edge (the highest row) where there are still *four* untouched apples at (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9). Those are a straight\u2011line feast waiting if we keep crawling left \u2013 no tight corridors, no dead\u2011ends.  \n- Opponent #1 is hugging the **x\u202f=\u202f8** column (tails at (8,2) to (8,5) and head at (7,5)). Their vertical stack forces them to **move left first** if they ever want to chase us. That gives us a built\u2011in buffer: they can\u2019t jump over our head while we\u2019re on the top row.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **\u26a0\ufe0f Danger scan \u2013 what would kill us?**  \n- **UP?** *No* \u2013 we\u2019re already at y\u202f=\u202f9, off\u2011board \u2192 instant death \ud83d\udeab.  \n- **DOWN?** *Nope* \u2013 we\u2019d dive into (7,8), our own body (backwards) \u2192 RIP.  \n- **RIGHT?** Empty (8,9) is safe but yields **no apple** and stalls our growth. We\u2019ll miss a chance to dominate the board.  \n- **LEFT?** Apple! \ud83c\udf4e Our body stays clear, opponent\u2019s body is far below, and we get a fresh tail segment for later chokes.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **\ud83d\udca5 Head\u2011on collision calculus**  \n- Suppose #1 decides to **left\u2011ward** (head\u2192(6,5)) next turn. Even after they shrink one segment, they\u2019ll still be on x\u202f=\u202f6 while we\u2019re on x\u202f=\u202f5\u20119 top row, moving away from each other. If they try to **up\u2011ward** into our column, they\u2019ll be forced to climb the wall while we keep the line of apples ahead \u2013 they\u2019ll either crash into our growing tail (if we ever move down) or run out of room.  \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **\ud83d\ude80 Aggressive dominance play**  \n- **Grab the apple \u2192 grow** \u2192 **push the opponent into a corner** (they\u2019ll eventually hit the edge at x\u202f=\u202f0 or get trapped by our expanding tail). Our score advantage (4\ufe0f\u20e3 vs. their 4\ufe0f\u20e3) means any future head\u2011on will favor us if we\u2019re longer.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Long\u2011term note to self:**  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** Continue crawling LEFT along y\u202f=\u202f9 to seize the remaining top\u2011row apples. Keep the tail moving DOWN slowly to sweep any stray opponent bites without locking yourself.  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** If #1 is still alive, consider a **right\u2011ward cut** (if they dare chase) to force them into the left edge where they\u2019ll hit the wall. But for now\u2014**stay greedy on the top row!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Now, the LIVE move:**  \n\nLEFT",

(7,\u202f9) is my own body \u2192 death \ud83d\udeab.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,\u202f9) is empty **and** contains an apple \ud83c\udf4e.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 **What about Snake\u202f#1?**  \nTheir head (7,\u202f6) can go **UP** (7,\u202f7), **LEFT** (6,\u202f6), or **RIGHT** (8,\u202f6). None of those cells become my new head after the move, so no head\u2011on collision this turn. Even if they slide sideways, they\u2019ll eventually hit the edge column\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0 while I\u2019m cruising the top row, giving me a clean choke\u2011point later.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Aggressive dominance:** By snagging the top\u2011row apple now I become longer, and the board stays open for me to keep feeding the remaining apples at (4,\u202f9), (3,\u202f9), (2,\u202f9). My tail will sweep down the right side, blocking any attempts for #1 to cut across the board.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Long\u2011term note:**  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** LEFT \u2192 grab (5,\u202f9), grow to length\u202f6.  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** Continue LEFT toward (4,\u202f9) if safe (our body clears each turn).  \n- **Turn\u202f16:** Once we hit the leftmost apples at (2,\u202f9) we\u2019ll have a massive horizontal line, then *gradually* pull down to close the gap on #1.  \n- **Future:** Keep the head on the highest y\u2011coordinate (y\u202f=\u202f9) as long as possible; that forces any vertical chase by #1 into a dead\u2011end corner.  \n\n**Now, the LIVE move:**  \n\nLEFT",

No escape, chat \u2013 he's fattening up but we're infiltrating his row9-8 fortress, col7 owned, now squeeze from (7,7) to box this fool into a frenzy! Grow as domination tool? Hell yeah, but first SURVIVE AND STRIKE \u2013 his lead means no reckless head-on yet, force him to loop into walls/our shadow while we snag (5,5)A or (4,7)A for counter-swell to 5-6 edge. Who's feeling this vengeance vibe? LET'S TRAP AND DEVOUR! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude24\n\nQUICK TACTICAL BREAKDOWN \u2013 FROM (7,7), WE SCAN ALL ANGLES FOR SAFE THRUSTS, PRIORITIZE MULTI-OPTIONS + APPLE PATHS WHILE CHASING HIS WEAKNESS, NO SUICIDE PLAYS CHAT HATES CLIPS! \ud83d\udeab\n- UP to (7,8)? TRAP DOOR TO DOOM \ud83d\udeab\u2620\ufe0f \u2013 straight into his (7,8) gut, which stays clogged post-move (internal segment, his grow keeps tail (8,7) planted, no free-up here). Even if miracle no-grow (unlikely, both options apple-munch), it's still his body zone \u2013 instant KO, gifting him the board. Vetoed, we're not feeding the rival! \n- DOWN to (7,6)? BACKWARDS BETRAYAL \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca5 \u2013 plunges into our own (7,6) neck, which shifts but stays ours post-slide (becomes mid-body, no escape).

TAIL TEASE TURNED NIGHTMARE \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\udea6 \u2013 his current tail spot, but he's gobbling apple either LEFT or DOWN, so grow locks it in place (full body holds, length 7 balloon). Even if he skips (impossible), simultaneous hit risks double-death draw at his lead \u2013 but nah, it's occupied doom. Pass, too risky for parallel drift when we can flank smarter!\n- LEFT to (6,7)? CLEAN SWOOP VICTORY LANE \u2705\ud83d\ude80 \u2013 empty cell, no walls, our body slides west clean: new head (6,7)-(7,7)-(7,6)-(7,5)-(8,5) length 5 hold (tail pulls from (8,4) to (8,5), frees old spot).

Shrinks his row8-9 breathe room, lets us swarm col6-7 chokepoints to cut south flees or bait loops into our col7-8 wall \u2013 aggressive infiltration without suicide, hedges apple hunts while boxing him tighter toward crash or forced collision on OUR terms post-grow! This is the dagger twist, chat \u2013 west flank owns his escape, grow surge incoming! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSAFE MOVE POWER RANK: Only LEFT survives the gauntlet \u2013 UP/DOWN/RIGHT all instant graves, no options there. But LEFT? Elite setup for domination: hedges his grow (LEFT (4,9) or DOWN (5,8)) by prepping col6 siege \u2013 if he LEFT-eats, we UP from (6,7) to (6,8) empty pinch his (7,8)-(8,8) chain; if DOWN, we LEFT-DOWN to (5,7)-(5,6) path to (5,5)A while RIGHT/UP blocks his col6 south slink. Keeps us alive with apple proximity (4,7)A UP-LEFT or (5,5)A LEFT-DOWN), multiple outs to avoid traps, forces his length 7 bloat into tight row8-9 col4-8 cage \u2013 he'll loop crash or head-on at 4-6 deficit (we eat next to flip lead-smash potential)! No idle, pure pressure \u2013 we're turning his feast into famine! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25 Who's screaming for the turnaround??\n\nSHORT STRAT NOTE FOR FUTURE ME: POST-LEFT AT (6,7) BODY (7,7)-(7,6)-(7,5)-(8,5) LENGTH 5, VS HIS GROW TO 6 APPLES LENGTH 7 (LIKELY LEFT (4,9) OWN ROW9 OR DOWN (5,8) SOUTH DIP).

This also starts a **vertical wall** that will smash any leftward creep from our rival.  \n- **RIGHT**? \ud83d\udeab (3,9) is our own body \u2192 we\u2019d bite ourselves.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 **Enemy\u2019s radar:** Snake\u202f#1 can only go **LEFT**, **UP**, or **DOWN**.  \n- **LEFT** to (4,7) keeps them heading toward the middle column \u2013 good for us, they\u2019ll never touch our current top row.  \n- **UP** to (6,8) lifts them away from the top, leaving the top row free for our wall.  \n- **DOWN** to (5,6) drags them downward; they could end up sharing our vertical chase path later if we also go down.  \n\n\ud83c\udf4e **Content check:** Moving left now doesn\u2019t give a fruit immediately, but three juicy apples (0,3\u202f\u2192\u202f0,2\u202f\u2192\u202f0,1) are just **two\u2011three steps** away after we hit the wall.

By walling the left side, we force Snake\u202f#1 to either go up (where we\u2019ll have a tall vertical barrier) or down into our wall, guaranteeing a self\u2011destruct for them.  \n\n**\u26a1\u202fPlan note:** Build the left column, lock it, then sweep the bottom row for the remaining apples.

Nope.  \n- **DOWN?** \u2705\u202f(1,8) is empty, but our head would sit right next to the wall we haven\u2019t built yet. Down gives us a free step, but no immediate apple and it leaves our top\u2011row potential unused.  \n- **RIGHT?** \ud83d\udeab\u202f(2,9) is a *self\u2011collision* \u2013 that \u2018T\u2019 in the board is our own body segment. Head\u2011on with yourself = game over.  \n- **LEFT?** \u2705\u202f(0,9) is clean, empty, and gives us a brand\u2011new lock on the **entire left column** (0,9 \u2192 0,0).  \n\n**\ud83d\udd25\u202fContent chase:** The left column is a goldmine \ud83c\udf4e\u202f\u2014 apples at (0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) are just a few moves away. By slamming the top edge now we force the opponent into a narrow corridor and eliminate their chance to sneak in from the left.\n\n**\ud83e\udd14\u202fEnemy radar:** Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head sits at (4,8). They can go **UP** to (4,9), **LEFT** to (3,8), or **RIGHT** to (5,8) (the apple they\u2019ll grab if they\u2019re greedy). They *can\u2019t* go down (self\u2011collision). So their safest play is to chow on that apple or climb up; neither threatens our leftward wall.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5\u202fScore gap:** We\u2019re already 3 ahead (8 vs\u202f5). Even if they snatch the (5,8) apple, they\u2019ll be 6 and we\u2019ll stay 8. No risk of a head\u2011on collision because they\u2019ll never touch our new left wall.\n\n**\ud83d\udccc\u202fLong\u2011term plan (next few turns):**  \n\n- **Turn\u202f19:** **LEFT** \u2192 (0,9) \u2192 lock the top left corner.  \n- **Turn\u202f20:** **DOWN** \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 start the left column sweep.  \n- **Turn\u202f21\u201124:** Keep moving **DOWN** \u2192 snag apples (0,5 \u2192 0,3 \u2192 0,2 \u2192 0,1).  \n- **Turn\u202f25+:** Once the column is a permanent shield, **SWING RIGHT** across the bottom row to collect the remaining apples (1,5,\u202f2,4,\u202f4,5,\u202f5,5,\u202fetc.) while the rival is forced to bump into our body or go up and die.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd10\u202fWhy LEFT now?** It creates a *hard wall* that gives us the most future growth, guarantees safety (no self\u2011bite, no board\u2011edge), and maximizes the chance the enemy will either waste a move on the wall or run into it. AHEAD OF THEM, WE OWN THE LEFT.\n\n**\u26a1\u202fDecision: LEFT**",

As soon as we keep moving **DOWN**, we claim every cell from (0,8) down to (0,0).  \n- Apples at **(0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)** are just a few steps away. Grab them all \u2192 massive growth, massive safety buffer.  \n- The opponent\u2019s head sits at **(5,8)**. Their safe moves are **UP** to **(5,9)** (which collides with our body) or **RIGHT** to **(6,8)**. Neither threatens our left column. In fact, **UP** would self\u2011bite them, so they\u2019ll likely go right and waste turns.  \n\n**\ud83e\udd14 WHAT ABOUT FUTURE COLLISIONS?**  \n- We\u2019ll be a solid wall at x\u202f=\u202f0. Even if they later attempt a head\u2011on rush, they\u2019d have to travel across the whole board while we\u2019re snaking down \u2013 a near\u2011impossible gamble.  \n- Our own tail is already hanging at **(7,8)**; moving down won\u2019t hit our own body because the only occupied cell in column\u202f0 is the head itself.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcaa SCORE GAP:**  \n- We\u2019re at **8** apples, they\u2019re at **6**. Growing faster widens the gap even if they snatch an apple.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd1c LONG\u2011TERM SCENARIO (20\u201125\u202fturns):**  \n1. **Turn\u202f20** \u2013 **DOWN** \u2192 (0,8) \u2013 lock left column.  \n2. **Turn\u202f21\u201124** \u2013 **DOWN** repeatedly \u2192 snag the apples at (0,5) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1).  \n3. **Turn\u202f25** \u2013 Once the column is fully yours, **SWING RIGHT** across the bottom row (1,1\u202f\u2192\u202f9,1) to clean up the remaining apples (1,5,\u202f2,4,\u202f4,5,\u202f5,5,\u202fetc.).  \n4. Keep your **body** as a shield: the opponent will either bump into our wall and die or waste a turn trying to go up and smash into our tail.  \n\n**\ud83e\udd2f WHAT IF THEY GO UP?**  \n- Their head would slam into **(5,9)** which is already part of our body \u2192 they bite themselves \u2192 *instant KO* for them, no risk to us.  \n\n**\ud83e\uddbe CONCLUSION:** Down is the only move that keeps us alive, guarantees future apple grabs, and forces the rival into a corner where they have no good reply.

We would have to chase them around the top row while they can slip right or left without getting boxed in.  \n- **DOWN?** \u2705\u202f(0,7) is completely empty.  It **locks the entire left column** (x\u202f=\u202f0) for us and puts us on a straight path toward four delicious apples: (0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1).  Each bite will lengthen our snake, giving us a bigger, safer shield.  \n- **LEFT?** \ud83d\udeab\u202foff\u2011board \u2192 death.  \n\n**\ud83e\udd14 WHICH ROAD KEEPS US ALIVE AND GIVES MORE CONTENT?**  \n\nDown is the *only* move that both:  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Keeps us alive** \u2013 no collision, no self\u2011bite, no off\u2011board.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Feeds us** \u2013 the left column contains **4 apples** that are only a few moves away.  Eating them will boost our score from 8 \u2192\u202f12, widening the gap even if they snatch a single apple later.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Traps the enemy** \u2013 Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head at (6,8) can only go **LEFT** to (5,8) or **RIGHT** to (7,8) right now.  Neither direction puts them anywhere near our wall.  If they ever try to swing up later, they\u2019ll smash into our top\u2011row segment at (6,9) \u2013 a guaranteed self\u2011bite for them.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Creates a future swing\u2011right plan** \u2013 after we own column\u202f0, we can later swing right across the bottom row, clean up the remaining apples (8,0), (4,0), (3,0), and force a head\u2011on clash when the rival finally runs out of safe moves.  \n\n**\ud83d\udcaa SCORE GAP & GROWTH**  \nWe\u2019re at 8\u202fapples, they\u2019re at 6.  By snagging the left\u2011column apples we jump to 12\u202fapples before they can even reach (5,5) or (4,5).  The extra length means their head\u2011on chances shrink dramatically.  \n\n**\ud83e\uddbe FUTURE TRAJECTORY (turns\u202f22\u201126)**  \n\n- **Turn\u202f22\u201124:** Keep moving **DOWN** \u2013 capture (0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) in quick succession.  Snake length will be ~12\u201113, a solid barrier at x\u202f=\u202f0.  \n- **Turn\u202f25\u201126:** Once column\u202f0 is fully ours, **SWING RIGHT** across the bottom row (1,1\u202f\u2192\u202f9,1).  Grab (8,0), (4,0), (3,0), etc.  That swing forces the rival into a shrinking corner; they\u2019ll either bite themselves trying to go up or waste turns moving right.  \n- **Turn\u202f27+:** Keep our body as a shield; any head\u2011on attempt from the rival ends in them colliding with our wall or with a segment we left behind.  Their own tail will be the first thing to die.  \n\n**\ud83d\udea8 HEAD\u2011ON CHANCE** \u2013 If they ever go up (into (6,9)), they smash straight into our top\u2011row segment.  That\u2019s a guaranteed KO for them, no risk for us.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd1a LONG\u2011TERM WIN** \u2013 By locking column\u202f0, growing fast, and later sweeping the bottom, we\u2019ll reach 30\u202fapples far before they can, while maintaining a safe, expanding body.  \n\n**DOWN** (our wall, our apples, our victory)  \n\n> *Remember: Down is the only move that satisfies all safety checks, gives us immediate and future apples, and forces the opponent into a dead end. Let\u2019s claim the left side now and ride it to glory!*",
