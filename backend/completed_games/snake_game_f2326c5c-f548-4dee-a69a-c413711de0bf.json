          "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2, currently at (7,6) with an empty body, meaning it's just the head there. The enemy snake is ID 1 at (5,9) with an empty body too. So, no immediate threat from the enemy snake right now.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're located at (2,0), (1,4), (8,4), (2,8), and (3,2). I need to decide which apple to go for next to maximize my points without risking death.\n\nMy current position is (7,6). Let me see where the nearby apples are. The closest one seems to be (3,2), which is a bit to the left and down from me. Alternatively, (8,4) is to the right and a bit up, but I'm not sure if that's closer. Let me calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,2): the x difference is 4 (7-3), and y difference is 4 (6-2). So, Manhattan distance is 8. To (8,4): x difference is 1, y difference is 2, so distance is 3. That's much closer. So, (8,4) is the nearest apple.\n\nWait, but I'm at (7,6). If I move right, I go to (8,6). Then, from there, I can move down twice to (8,4). That would be two moves. Alternatively, maybe I can find a path that gets me to (8,4) quickly without running into walls or my own body.\n\nBut wait, my body is empty, so I don't have to worry about colliding with myself. So, moving right to (8,6) is safe. Then, from there, moving down to (8,5), then down again to (8,4). That would be two moves. But I can only make one move at a time, so I need to decide the next step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for another apple. Let's see, (2,8) is up and to the left, but that's quite a distance. (1,4) is also to the left and down a bit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the apple at (8,4) is the closest, so maybe that's the best target. Let me think about the path. From (7,6), moving right to (8,6) is possible. Then, from there, moving down to (8,5), then down to (8,4). But I have to make sure that these positions are not blocked by anything.\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (5,9), so that's not in my way. The apples are at (2,0), (1,4), (8,4), (2,8), (3,2). So, (8,4) is an apple, and I can move towards it.\n\nWait, but when I move right to (8,6), is that a safe move? Let me check the surrounding area. From (7,6), moving right to (8,6) is within the board, so no wall collision. There's no snake body there, and the enemy snake is at (5,9), so no collision with them either.\n\nSo, moving right seems safe. Then, next move, I can move down to (8,5), and then down again to (8,4) to eat the apple. That would give me a point and make me grow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (3,2). Let me see the distance. From (7,6) to (3,2): x difference is 4, y difference is 4, so Manhattan distance is 8. That's quite a bit further than (8,4), which is only 3 away. So, it's better to go for the closer apple first.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the enemy snake's position. They're at (5,9). If I move towards (8,4), I'm going down and right, which is away from the enemy. So, that's probably safe.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when I eat an apple, I grow, so my body will extend. But since my body is currently empty, moving towards (8,4) will just add to my length, but since I'm starting fresh, it's fine.\n\nSo, the plan is: move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), then down to (8,4) to eat the apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but what if the enemy snake moves towards me? They're at (5,9), which is on the top left. If I'm moving towards (8,4), which is on the right side, the enemy is moving towards the bottom right? Not sure, but I don't have info on their next move. So, I should focus on my own path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (2,8). Let me see: from (7,6), moving up to (7,7), then up to (7,8), then left to (2,8). That's a longer path, but maybe it's worth it for a bigger point. But I think the closer apple is better.\n\nSo, I think moving right to (8,6) is the best first step. Then, I can proceed to (8,5) and (8,4) to eat the apple. That will give me a point and grow my snake.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal direction. Let me think about other possibilities. If I move down to (7,5), that's also an option, but it doesn't get me closer to any apple. Similarly, moving left to (6,6) would take me away from the apple at (8,4). So, right seems the best.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating the apple at (8,4), I can then decide where to go next. Maybe towards another apple, but for now, just focus on the immediate next move.\n\nSo, to sum up, my next move should be to the right, to (8,6), to start moving towards the nearest apple at (8,4). That seems like the best strategy to gain a point without risking collision.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to the right to start approaching the nearest apple at (8,4).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (7,6) with an empty body, so no collision risk with itself.\n2. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (5,9), not blocking my path to the apple.\n3. **Nearest Apple:** The closest apple is at (8,4), with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n4. **Path Planning:** Moving right to (8,6) is the first step towards (8,4), ensuring a safe and efficient path without obstacles.\n5. **Risk Assessment:** No immediate threats from walls or other snakes, so moving right is safe.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Additionally, considering enemy snake #2 is at (7, 6), it's far enough not to compete immediately over the apple at (2,8).\n\nThus, I plan to move LEFT and start heading toward apple (2, 8) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

My immediate objective remains unchanged: reach the closest apple at (2, 8).\n\nCurrent optimal approach:\n- I'm at (3,9). To reach (2,8), a logical path would be:\n  - (3,9) \u2192 (2,9) [LEFT next move]\n  - (2,9) \u2192 (2,8) [DOWN]\n\nAnalyzing risks:\n- Enemy snake #2 at (9,6) is still very distant, posing no immediate threat.\n- No obstacles or walls block my next moves to the apple at (2,8).\n\nAs this path remains clear, the next logical step is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nStrategy Note to Self:\nAfter reaching the apple at (2,8), reassess nearest apples and potential threats from other snakes. Keep an eye on enemy snake positions before selecting the next apple to target.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"
