Let's analyze this board and plan our attack on Snake #1. \n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (4,9), body empty, 0 apples. I'm on the top row, near the left side.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1): Head at (7,9), body empty, 0 apples. Enemy is also on the top row, 3 cells to my right.\n- Apple drops: 15 apples scattered around, but we're ignoring apples for now. We need to dominate the enemy!\n- Board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n1. **Immediate Threat:** Enemy is at (7,9), same row, 3 cells away. If they move LEFT twice and I move RIGHT, we could collide. But we need to think about turn 1.\n2. **My Position:** I'm at (4,9). My options:\n   - UP: (4,10) - OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n   - DOWN: (4,8) - Safe, empty cell, keeps me on board. \u2705\n   - LEFT: (3,9) - Safe, empty cell. \u2705\n   - RIGHT: (5,9) - Safe, empty cell. \u2705\n\n3. **Enemy Prediction:** At (7,9), their options:\n   - UP: Off board (dead) - unlikely\n   - DOWN: (7,8) - Safe\n   - LEFT: (6,9) - Safe  \n   - RIGHT: (8,9) - Safe\n\n4. **Strategy:** I need to set up a trap. Since we're both starting with 0 apples, head-on collision is a draw. But if I can get an apple first, I'll have the advantage for a collision!\n5. **Apple Consideration:** Even though we said ignore apples, there are apples at (3,8) and (0,7) that are reachable. But more importantly, I need to position myself to cut off the enemy's escape routes.\n\n**Long-term Plan (for next turn):**\nMove DOWN to (4,8) to get off the top wall and open up more movement options. This puts me directly below my current position and starts building a vertical presence. From (4,8), I can head toward the apple at (3,8) on turn 2, while keeping pressure on the enemy who's likely moving LEFT or DOWN.\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n- UP: Death (off board)\n- LEFT: (3,9) - Safe but keeps me on top wall, limiting future mobility\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - Safe but moves me toward enemy at (7,9) - risky if they move LEFT\n- DOWN: (4,8) - Safe, opens up board, gives me more options next turn\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (4,8) gives me the most flexibility and prepares me to chase apples while staying away from immediate collision risk with the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

My body is at (4,8) - I'm growing already! \n\n**THE VIBE CHECK:**\n- **My Score:** 1 \ud83c\udf4e (First blood!)\n- **Enemy Score:** 0 \ud83c\udf4e \n- **Head at:** (3,8)\n- **Body at:** (4,8)\n- **Enemy Head:** (7,7) \u2014 they moved DOWN from (7,8)!\n- **Threat Assessment:** Enemy is now at (7,7), three cells below me and two to the right. They're playing defensive, not charging me directly.\n\n**BOARD STATE MAP (visualizing positions):**\nFrom my vantage at (3,8), the battlefield looks like this:\n```\n9  . . . . . . . . . .\n8  . . T 0 . . . . . .\n7  . . . A . . . 1 . .\n6  . . A . . . . . . .\n5  . . . . . A . . . .\n4  . . . . . A A . . .\n3  A A A A . . . . . A\n2  . . . . A . . . . .\n1  . . . . . . . . . .\n0  . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\nFrom (3,8), my options:\n\n1. **UP to (3,9)** \u2014 Top of the board. Safe from collision but will limit future movement (only 2 directions next turn: DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT). I'd be boxed against the wall. Not ideal for \"DOMINANCE\" flow.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,7)** \u2014 Directly above enemy at (7,7) if they move toward me. There's an apple here! But this is risky \u2014 if enemy moves UP to (7,8), they're not colliding. However, moving DOWN puts me closer to the center where apples cluster. This is AGGRESSIVE positioning!\n\n3. **LEFT to (2,8)** \u2014 Empty cell, moves me away from enemy. Safe but boring. Takes me further from the apple-rich zone in the center-bottom.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,8)** \u2014 Wait, that's my own body! My tail is literally at (4,8) right now. Moving into my own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c NEVER DO THIS.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere will snake #1 move from (7,7)?\n- UP (7,8) \u2014 back toward where I just came from. Defensive.\n- DOWN (7,6) \u2014 toward bottom-right apples. That's where the action is!\n- LEFT (7,6) \u2014 same as above, moving toward center.\n- RIGHT (8,7) \u2014 toward edge, less resources.\n\nBased on board density, enemy likely moves DOWN or LEFT to chase apples, not toward me.\n\n**STRATEGY EXECUTION:**\nMoving **DOWN to (3,7)** is the play! Here's why:\n- **Dominance:** I'm aggressively moving TOWARD the enemy's potential path while grabbing the apple at (3,7) that's been chilling there. That's +1 point and now I'm at 2 apples!\n- **Field Control:** From (3,7), I can pivot left, right, or down next turn. I'll have MULTIPLE escape routes.\n- **Forcing Engagement:** If enemy moves UP, we're on a collision course. But since I have more apples (1-0), a head-on collision would be MY WIN if it happens. That's calculated aggression! \n- **Apple Denial:** (3,7) is an apple drop. Taking it denies resources while boosting my score.\n\n**THE MOVE:** DOWN to (3,7) \u2014 GRAB THAT APPLE, PRESSURE THE ENEMY, AND SET UP FOR THE CHECKMATE NEXT TURN!\n\nChat, if I pull this off, we're building momentum FAST. Let's gooo! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (SELF-REFERENCE):**\nNext turn, from (3,7) with 2 apples, I'll assess if enemy is closing in. If they move toward me aggressively, I might have the points advantage for a head-on collision finish. If they dodge, I'll flow toward the center-bottom apple cluster at (4,4) and (5,4) while boxing them toward the right wall. Be ready to pivot LEFT to (2,7) or RIGHT to (4,7) depending on their path.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (3,7) \u2014 Just grabbed that apple! \ud83c\udf4e Score: 2\n- **My Body:** [(3,8), (4,8)] \u2014 Getting longer and stronger!\n- **Enemy Head:** (7,6) \u2014 Wait, they moved DOWN from (7,7) to (7,6)!\n- **Enemy Body:** None (shorter than me)\n- **Board:** 10x10 grid, I'm centered-left, enemy is bottom-right\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (3,7):**\nAvailable moves from my current head position:\n\n1. **UP to (3,8)** \u2014 BACK INTO MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD INSTANTLY. My body segment is literally right there. This is suicide.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,6)** \u2014 Check the board: (3,6) is currently empty (board shows: row 6 is \"A A A . . . . 1 . .\"). This is SAFE and moves me toward the apple cluster in the bottom-left! Plus gets me closer to the center where I can control the board.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2,7)** \u2014 Board shows (2,7) is empty. This moves me LEFT and slightly UP. Safe but takes me away from the main apple action.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,7)** \u2014 Board shows (4,7) is empty. Safe, but I have to check my tail movement. My body is [(3,8), (4,8)], so when I move, my tail at (4,8) might move... Actually, if I eat an apple at (3,7) last turn, I'm growing! My tail might NOT move this turn because I grew. Need to be careful.\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** \nThe apple at (3,7) I just ate means I grew by 1! So my tail might not move this turn if the growth effect persists. But the immediate danger is (3,8) being my body segment.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (7,6) with 0 apples. Where will they go?\n- They're near the right wall with apples at (9,3) and bottom-right area\n- Likely they'll move DOWN toward (7,5) or LEFT toward center-bottom apples\n- They won't come directly at me yet (they're at (7,6), I'm at (3,7) \u2014 that's 4 columns away)\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to:\n1. STAY ALIVE (obviously)\n2. Move toward the apple-rich bottom-left area\n3. Keep options open for future turns\n4. Avoid boxing myself in against walls\n\n**DOWN TO (3,6)** is the winning move because:\n- \u2705 It's SAFE (empty cell)\n- \u2705 Moves me toward the apple cluster at (4,5) and (5,4)\n- \u2705 Keeps me central enough to pivot LEFT or RIGHT next turn\n- \u2705 Takes me away from my own body (no collision risk)\n- \u2705 Sets up potential head-on collision if enemy moves up (unlikely but I'd win with 2-0 score lead)\n- \u2705 Maintains board control and growth momentum\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (SELF-REFERENCE):**\nNext turn, from (3,6) with 2 apples, I'll have multiple safe directions (LEFT to 2,6, DOWN to 3,5, or RIGHT to 4,6). I'll track enemy movement\u2014if they go LEFT toward me, I might set up a collision since I have the score advantage. If they stay right, I'll continue sweeping the bottom-left apple cluster (there's (4,5), (5,4), (5,5), (4,2) in that area) to extend my lead. Goal: reach 3-4 apples before forcing engagement. I want to box them against the right wall while I dominate the center-left.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 aggressive growth, board control, and setting up for the win!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE at turn 4 with the lead! Let's analyze this board!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 6) \u2014 Just moved DOWN from (3,7) and didn't eat (since 0,6 is an apple but that's not my new head position). Score still 2.\n- **My Body:** Now [(3,7), (3,8)] \u2014 The tail at (4,8) moved because I didn't eat last turn? Wait, let me trace: My head was at (3,7). I moved DOWN to (3,6). My body was [(3,8), (4,8)]? No, the previous state had body [(3,7), (3,8)]? Let's re-examine. The replay said: \"My Head: (3,7) \u2014 Just grabbed that apple! \ud83c\udf4e Score: 2\" and \"My Body: [(3,8), (4,8)]\". But that seems inconsistent with the board state at turn 3. The board state at turn 3 showed:\n  - Row 7: \"A A . T . . . . . .\" where T is my body (since my head was (3,7) and that's the dot? Wait, the board state given at the start of this turn says:\n    Row 7: \"A A . T . . . . . .\" (T is my body at (3,7)? No, the board uses '0' for my head and 'T' for my body. So at turn 3, my head was (3,7) and body was at (3,8) and (4,8)? But the board shows row 8: \". . . T . . . . . .\" (T at (3,8)), row 7: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" (dot at (3,7) because head moved away? Actually, the board state provided in the prompt is for the CURRENT turn (turn 4). It shows my head at (3,6) and body at (3,7) and (3,8). So my previous move DOWN from (3,7) to (3,6) caused my tail to move: the old tail at (4,8) is gone, and now my body is (3,7) and (3,8). That means I didn't eat an apple at (3,7) last turn? But the replay said \"Just grabbed that apple!\" \u2014 that must have been a mistake in the replay. The apple at (0,6) is still there according to the board state at turn 4, row 6: \"A A A 0 . . . . . .\" \u2014 the '0' is my head at (3,6), and the apples are at (0,6), (1,6), (2,6)? Actually, row 6 shows \"A A A 0 . . . . . .\" meaning (0,6) A, (1,6) A, (2,6) A, (3,6) 0. So I didn't eat an apple last turn because my head moved to (3,6) which is empty, and the apple at (0,6) is still there. So my score remains 2. Good to clarify.\n\n- **Enemy Head:** (7,5) \u2014 Moved DOWN from (7,6)? The board shows enemy at (7,5) with no body. Score still 0.\n- **Board:** 10x10. Apple at (0,6) is very close! Also apples at (2,6), (1,3), etc. I'm at (3,6) with body (3,7) and (3,8).\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (3,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (3,7)** \u2014 That's my own body! DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (3,5)** \u2014 Check board: (3,5) is empty? Row 5: \". . . . . A . 1 . .\" so (3,5) is the third dot? Actually row 5 is columns 0-9: 0: ., 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: A, 6: ., 7: 1, 8: ., 9: . So (3,5) is column 3, row 5: it's a dot (empty). Safe.\n3. **LEFT to (2,6)** \u2014 That's an apple! (2,6) has an apple. If I go LEFT, I eat it, grow, score becomes 3. But need to check if it's safe: (2,6) is not occupied by any snake body currently. Enemy is at (7,5). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,6)** \u2014 Check board: row 6, column 4 is a dot (empty). Safe.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP is dead.\n- DOWN (3,5): empty, safe.\n- LEFT (2,6): apple, empty, safe.\n- RIGHT (4,6): empty, safe.\n\nAll three remaining moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (7,5) with 0 apples. He's near the right wall. Apples nearby: (9,3) is far, (5,4) and (5,5) are somewhat close but he's at (5,7)? Actually he's at (7,5). He could move LEFT toward the center (toward me), DOWN toward (7,4), UP toward (7,6), or RIGHT toward (8,5). He might go for apples in the bottom-right? But the only apple in that area is (9,3) and maybe (4,0) but that's far. He might try to come toward me to intercept? Or grow safely elsewhere.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- I have a 2-0 apple lead. I want to extend that lead aggressively.\n- Apple at (2,6) is VERY close and I can eat it this turn by going LEFT. That would put my head at (2,6), my body at (3,6) and (3,7), and I'd grow to length 4 (since I didn't eat last turn, my tail moved, so current length is 3, after eating I'd be length 4). Score would be 3-0.\n- After eating, I'd be at (2,6) with body (3,6) and (3,7). Then next turn I have options: UP to (2,7) (empty), DOWN to (2,5) (check board: row 5 column 2 is empty), LEFT to (1,6) (apple at (1,6)!). So I could chain eat another apple next turn if I go LEFT this turn. That's very aggressive growth.\n- If I go RIGHT to (4,6), I'm moving away from the apple cluster (0,6),(1,6),(2,6) and toward (4,5) which has an apple? Actually (4,5) is apple according to row 5: column 5 is A. But I'm at (3,6), so (4,6) is empty, then next turn I could go DOWN to (4,5) to eat that apple. That's also good growth but slightly slower.\n- If I go DOWN to (3,5), I'm moving toward the apple at (4,5) and (5,4), but not eating immediately. That might be safer but less aggressive.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Going LEFT to (2,6) eats an apple immediately. That's huge. But is there any collision risk? Enemy is far away. My own body is at (3,7) and (3,8). I'm moving to (2,6), which is not adjacent to my body in a way that would cause collision. However, after I move, my tail will move if I didn't eat an apple last turn? Wait, I didn't eat last turn (my head went from (3,7) to (3,6), no apple). So my tail will move this turn when I move to (2,6). That means my current tail (3,8) will disappear, and my body will become (3,7) and (3,6)? Actually, careful: When I move without eating, my tail disappears. So if I move LEFT from (3,6) to (2,6) and eat an apple, I GROW, so my tail does NOT disappear. But I need to track: At the start of turn 4, my head is at (3,6), body is (3,7) and (3,8). That's length 3. If I move LEFT to (2,6) and eat an apple, I grow to length 4. So my body will become: new head (2,6), old head (3,6), old body (3,7). The tail (3,8) remains? Actually, since I grew, the tail does not move. So after the move, my snake will be: head (2,6), body (3,6) and (3,7), tail (3,8). That's fine.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (2,6) is on the board. However, I must also consider if the enemy could move into (2,6) on the same turn? No, enemy is at (7,5), moving one step max. They cannot reach (2,6) in one turn. So no head-on collision risk.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf I eat the apple at (2,6) this turn, next turn I'm at (2,6) with body (3,6),(3,7). The apple at (1,6) is directly to my LEFT. I could eat that next turn, moving to (1,6) and scoring another point. That would put me at 4 apples, enemy at 0. Then I could go for the apple at (0,6) the turn after. I'd have a chain of apples on row 6. Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck on the right. I could then pivot to the center or down to the other apples. This is aggressive but safe. I'm boxing the enemy in by controlling the center-left and growing rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, if I go RIGHT now, I might be slower. But going LEFT is the most direct and fastest growth. Since I have a lead, I want to extend it as fast as possible to reach 30 apples before the enemy even gets 1.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (2,6) to eat the apple. It's safe, grows me, and sets up a chain for the next two turns. This is the move that maximizes my score lead quickly. Let's do it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN (SELF-REFERENCE):**\nFrom (2,6) with body (3,6) and (3,7), I will likely go LEFT to (1,6) to eat the next apple and extend my lead to 4-0. Then from (1,6) with body (2,6) and (3,6), I'll go LEFT to (0,6) for apple #5. After that, I'll have to assess the enemy's position\u2014if they've moved toward me, I might set up a collision since I'll have a huge score lead. If not, I'll sweep down to the apple at (1,3) or (4,5). The goal is to dominate the board and force the enemy into a corner.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (2,6) \u2014 eat that apple, grow, and continue the aggressive streak!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE at turn 5 and I'm sitting pretty with 3 apples against a zero-apple enemy! Let's break this down like we're plotting a takeover.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 6) \u2014 Just ate that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e Score is now 3-0 in my favor.\n- **My Body:** [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)] \u2014 I've grown to length 4. The tail at (3, 8) is locked in since I ate.\n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 5) \u2014 Wait, the board shows enemy at (6, 5) with no body? Actually, looking back at the initial board: \"5 . . . . . A 1 . . .\" so enemy head is at (6, 5). He moved from (7, 5) to (6, 5)? That's LEFT toward the center. Interesting\u2014he's coming closer. Score still 0.\n- **Board:** Apple at (1, 6) is RIGHT there to my LEFT! And apple at (0, 6) is just beyond that. The apple cluster on row 6 is prime real estate. Enemy is at (6, 5), which is 4 cells away from me. He's not an immediate threat but he's advancing.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (2, 6):**\n1. **UP to (2, 7)** \u2014 Check board: Row 7, column 2 is currently an apple? Wait, the board shows row 7: \"A A . T . . . . . .\" so (2, 7) is a dot? Actually, row 7 columns: 0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:T (my body), 4:., etc. So (2, 7) is empty (dot). Safe.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 5)** \u2014 Row 5, column 2: Row 5 is \" . . . . . A 1 . . .\" so (2, 5) is a dot (empty). Safe.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6)** \u2014 This is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e I'd eat it, grow to length 5, score to 4-0. Need to check safety: (1, 6) is not occupied by any snake body. Enemy is at (6, 5). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6)** \u2014 That's my own body! DEAD. \u274c (My body includes (3, 6)). Can't go right.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: Safe (empty)\n- DOWN: Safe (empty)\n- LEFT: Safe (apple, empty)\n- RIGHT: DEAD (own body)\n\nThree safe moves. But one of them gives me an apple immediately!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (6, 5) with 0 apples. He's moving LEFT toward the center. Apples near him: (5, 4) and (5, 5) are to his left/up? Actually (5, 5) is apple at column 5 row 5. He's at (6, 5), so (5, 5) is directly LEFT. He might go LEFT to (5, 5) to eat an apple. That's likely. Alternatively, he could go DOWN to (6, 4) which is empty? Row 4: \" . . . . . A A . . .\" so (6, 4) is apple! Actually row 4, column 6 is an apple (the second A). So (6, 4) is also an apple. He has two apple options: LEFT to (5, 5) or DOWN to (6, 4). Both are apples. He might pick one. Either way, he's growing soon.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- I have a 3-0 lead. I want to extend it FAST. The apple at (1, 6) is directly accessible. If I take it, I'm at 4-0 and my head moves to (1, 6) with body (2, 6) and (3, 6). Then next turn, I can go LEFT to (0, 6) for apple #5. That's two apples in two turns\u2014maximizing my lead before enemy even gets his first.\n- If I go UP or DOWN, I'm not eating immediately. That gives the enemy time to catch up. Since he's likely eating an apple this turn (either (5,5) or (6,4)), he'll be at 1 apple. If I delay, my lead shrinks.\n- Going LEFT also positions me to control the left side of the board. The enemy is on the right. I'm boxing him in by claiming the apple cluster.\n- Is there any risk of head-on collision? If enemy goes LEFT to (5,5) and I go LEFT to (1,6), no collision. If he goes DOWN to (6,4), also no collision. We're far apart.\n- What about future moves? From (1, 6) after eating, I'll have options: LEFT to (0,6) (apple), UP to (1,7) (empty? Row 7 column 1 is apple actually\u2014row 7: \"A A . T . . . . .\" so (1,7) is apple! That's another apple!), DOWN to (1,5) (empty). So multiple safe options. From (0,6) after eating, I could go UP to (0,7) (apple! row 7 column 0 is apple) or DOWN to (0,5) (empty). I can chain multiple apples.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Moving LEFT to (1,6) is safe. Enemy cannot reach (1,6) in one turn from (6,5). Minimum distance is 5 cells (LEFT 5 steps). No risk.\n- I might worry about trapping myself later. But with my body positioned at (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), I have space. If I go LEFT to (1,6), I'll have body (2,6), (3,6), (3,7). The tail is at (3,8) which will move if I don't eat next turn. I'll have room to maneuver.\n- The enemy might try to intercept later, but with a 4-0 lead, I can afford to be aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1,6) this turn (score 4-0). Next turn, eat the apple at (0,6) (score 5-0). Then, depending on enemy position, either go UP to (0,7) for apple #6 or pivot right toward the center apples (like (1,3), (2,3), etc.). The goal is to hit 30 apples before the enemy even gets to 10. Dominate the board, force him into a corner, and if he ever tries to head-on me, I'll win the collision because I have more apples.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (1,6) \u2014 eat that apple, extend the lead, and keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down the current state and secure our next move.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 6) - We just ate that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e Score is now 4-1. My body is [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. The tail is at (3, 8).\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 5) - He moved UP from (5, 5) to (4, 5). That's interesting\u2014he skipped the apple at (5, 5) and went toward the center. Maybe he's planning something? Score is still 1.\n- **Board State:** Row 6 shows: \"A 0 T T A . . . . .\" at columns 0-4. So (0, 6) is an apple, (2, 6) is my body, (3, 6) is my body, (4, 6) is an apple! There's an apple at (4, 6) to my RIGHT. Also, apple at (0, 6) to my LEFT, and apple at (6, 4) and others elsewhere.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (1, 6):**\n1. **UP to (1, 7)** - Row 7, column 1: Row 7 shows \"A A . T . . . . .\" so (1, 7) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Would eat and grow to length 6. Safety check: Not occupied by any snake. Safe.\n2. **DOWN to (1, 5)** - Row 5, column 1: Row 5 shows \". . . . . 1 T . . .\" so (1, 5) is empty (dot). Safe.\n3. **LEFT to (0, 6)** - Row 6, column 0: That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Would eat and grow. Safety check: Empty. Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 6)** - Row 6, column 2: That's my own body (segment 2)! DEAD \u274c.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: Safe (apple)\n- DOWN: Safe (empty)\n- LEFT: Safe (apple)\n- RIGHT: DEAD (own body)\n\nThree safe moves, two with immediate apples! I need to eat to extend my lead. The enemy is at (4, 5) - that's only 3 cells away from my potential positions. He might go UP to (4, 6) which is an apple! Or LEFT to (3, 5) which is empty. If he goes UP to (4, 6), that's the apple I could potentially get to. That would be a head-on collision if I go RIGHT to (2, 6) next turn and he goes UP to (4, 6), but we're not there yet. Actually, if I go LEFT to (0, 6) this turn, I'm safe. If I go UP to (1, 7), I'm safe. If I go DOWN to (1, 5), I'm safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (4, 5) with 1 apple. Options:\n- UP to (4, 6): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e He'd eat and grow to length 3, score 2-4.\n- LEFT to (3, 5): Empty (dot). Safe but no apple.\n- DOWN to (4, 4): Row 4 shows \". . . . . A A . . .\" so (4, 4) is empty? Actually row 4 columns: 0-3 are dots, 4 is dot? Wait, row 4 is \" . . . . . A A . . .\" so columns: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:A, 7:., 8:., 9:.. So (4, 4) is empty. Safe but no apple.\n- RIGHT to (5, 5): That's where he just came from? Actually he moved from (5, 5) to (4, 5) last turn. So (5, 5) is now empty (since he left it). No apple there anymore (the apple at (5, 5) is gone\u2014he must have eaten it? Wait, the scoreboard says he has 1 apple, and he moved to (4, 5). Did he eat an apple at (5, 5)? Let's check previous turns... Actually, looking at the board history, apple at (5, 5) was there. He was at (6, 5) and moved LEFT to (5, 5) on turn 5? But the last move rationale said he was at (6, 5) and might go to (5, 5). In the current board, row 5 shows \" . . . . . 1 T . . .\" with (5, 5) empty and (4, 5) has the enemy head. So he likely moved from (6, 5) to (5, 5) on turn 5, ate the apple there, and grew. Then on turn 6, he moved from (5, 5) to (4, 5). So he has eaten 1 apple. That makes sense.\n\nSo enemy likely goes UP to (4, 6) for the apple. That's a strong possibility.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- I have a 4-1 lead. I need to extend it. The apple at (1, 7) (UP) or (0, 6) (LEFT) are both viable. Which gives better positioning?\n- If I go LEFT to (0, 6): I eat apple, head moves to (0, 6), body becomes [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail is at (3, 7) next turn. From (0, 6), I can go UP to (0, 7) (apple on row 7 column 0!), DOWN to (0, 5) (empty), or RIGHT back to (1, 6) (which will be empty after tail moves). So good options.\n- If I go UP to (1, 7): I eat apple, head moves to (1, 7), body becomes [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail at (3, 7) moves. From (1, 7), I can go UP to (1, 8) (empty? Row 8: \" . A . T . . . . . .\" so (1, 8) is apple! Actually row 8 shows \"A . T . . . . . . .\" wait let's check: Row 8: \" . A . T . . . . . .\" so column 1 is A? Yes, (1, 8) is apple! \ud83c\udf4e), LEFT to (0, 7) (apple), DOWN to (1, 6) (empty next turn), RIGHT to (2, 7) (empty? Row 7 column 2 is dot). So also good options.\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 5): No apple, no score gain. Not ideal when I can eat now.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT give me an apple and good future options. But which is safer considering enemy? If enemy goes UP to (4, 6), we're far apart. However, if I go LEFT to (0, 6), I'm moving away from enemy. If I go UP to (1, 7), I'm moving slightly closer to enemy but still safe. Actually, distance from (0, 6) to (4, 6) is 4 cells. Distance from (1, 7) to (4, 6) is 3 cells (diagonally). Not a big difference.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat apple now to extend lead to 5-1. Then next turn, depending on position, eat another apple on row 0 or row 7. Control the left side and force enemy into the center. If enemy gets too close, I can use my body length to trap him. With 5+ apples, I can afford to be more aggressive.\n\n**DECISION:** Both UP and LEFT are good. But let's check board: There are apples at (0, 6) and (1, 7). (1, 7) is directly above me. Going LEFT to (0, 6) might leave me more exposed on the left edge. Going UP to (1, 7) keeps me more central with access to multiple apples. Also, if I go UP to (1, 7), I can next turn go LEFT to (0, 7) (apple) or UP to (1, 8) (apple). That's a nice cluster. If I go LEFT to (0, 6), I can only go UP to (0, 7) or DOWN to (0, 5). (0, 7) is apple, (0, 5) is empty. So UP seems slightly better for future apples.\n\nWait, but (0, 6) is also an apple. And going LEFT might be safer from enemy? Enemy is at (4, 5). He's not heading toward me. He's more likely to go UP to (4, 6). So both are safe.\n\nI'll go UP to eat the apple at (1, 7). That gives me access to two apples in the next move (UP to (1, 8) or LEFT to (0, 7)).\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP to (1, 7) \u2014 eat the apple, extend lead to 5-1, and position for more apples!\n\nUP",

We're in turn 7 and we're still dominating with a 5-1 lead! \ud83d\udcaa Let's break down the situation.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head is at (1, 7) after eating that sweet apple last turn! Score: 5-1\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (5, 4) with body [(5, 5), (6, 5)], apples: 2\n- Board is getting crowded but we're positioned perfectly!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (1, 7):**\n1. **UP to (1, 8)** - Row 8: \". A . T . . . . .\" \u2192 (1, 8) is AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Would give us 6-1 lead!\n   - Safety check: Not occupied by any snake. SAFE!\n   - Future options: From (1, 8) we can go LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8), DOWN (1,7), or UP (1,9)\n   \n2. **DOWN to (1, 6)** - Row 6: \"A 0 T T A . . . . .\" \u2192 (1, 6) is where we just came from, now empty. Safe but no apple.\n   \n3. **LEFT to (0, 7)** - Row 7: \"A 0 . T . . . . .\" \u2192 (0, 7) is ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Also gives us 6-1 lead!\n   - Safety check: Empty space. SAFE!\n   - Future options: From (0,7) we can go UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7)\n   \n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7)** - Row 7 column 2: Empty (dot). Safe but no apple.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nBoth UP and LEFT give us apples! That's content! \ud83c\udf89 But which is better?\n\n- **UP to (1, 8):** Takes us to row 8, connects us to the apple at (2, 8) eventually? Actually (2, 8) is empty? Row 8: \". A . T . . . . .\" \u2192 (2, 8) is dot, (3, 8) is my tail! Actually wait, (3, 8) is my tail. From (1, 8) I can go RIGHT to (2, 8) which is safe, then UP or RIGHT further. \n- **LEFT to (0, 7):** Takes us to the edge! But there's an apple at (0, 8) above! And (0, 6) below. Actually (0, 6) is apple! So from (0, 7) I can go DOWN to (0, 6) for another apple! That's a nice combo!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5, 4) with body [(5,5), (6,5)]. Options:\n- UP to (5, 5): That's his own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- DOWN to (5, 3): Row 3: \"A A A A . . A . . A\" \u2192 (5, 3) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (4, 4): Row 4: \". . . . . A A . . .\" \u2192 (4, 4) is empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6, 4): Row 6 column 6: Empty (dot). Safe but no apple? Actually row 6 shows \"(6,4)\" is dot.\n\nMost likely he goes DOWN to (5, 3) or LEFT to (4, 4). Either way, he's not coming toward us immediately.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nBoth UP and LEFT are great! But LEFT to (0, 7) gives us access to TWO apples in sequence: (0, 7) now, then DOWN to (0, 6) next turn! That's a delicious combo! Meanwhile UP to (1, 8) gives us one apple but then we're near our tail at (3, 8). Actually wait, (3, 8) is my tail, but it will move next turn. So it's safe.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: From (1, 7), UP to (1, 8) gets us the apple there. From (1, 8), we can go LEFT to (0, 8) which is empty? Row 8: \". A . T . . . . .\" \u2192 (0, 8) is dot. Or DOWN to (1, 7) which will be empty. Or RIGHT to (2, 8) which is dot.\n\nFrom (0, 7), we can go DOWN to (0, 6) which is an apple! That's an immediate next-turn apple! That's huge! We could get 7-1 lead quickly!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nWe want to control the left edge and force the enemy into the center where we can trap him. Going LEFT now gives us access to the apple at (0, 6) next turn. We'll eat that, then we're at (0, 6) with 7-1 lead. Then we can go DOWN to (0, 5) or UP to (0, 7) (which will be empty). From (0, 5), we can go RIGHT to (1, 5) which is empty. This keeps us near the edge with options.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (0, 7)! Let's eat that apple and set up for the next apple at (0, 6)!\n\nLEFT",

DEAD! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,4): Row 4 column 7: Empty (dot). Safe but no apple.\n\nHe'll almost certainly go DOWN to (6,3) for the apple! That's good - he's moving away from us.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to think 2-3 moves ahead. If we go DOWN to (0,6) now:\n- Turn 9: At (0,6) with 7 apples, likely need to go DOWN to (0,5) (safe)\n- Turn 10: At (0,5), can go DOWN to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,5)\n\nIf we go UP to (0,8) now:\n- Turn 9: Can go RIGHT to (1,8) for apple! 7-1 lead\n- Turn 10: From (1,8), can go UP to (1,9) (empty), LEFT (0,8), DOWN (1,7), RIGHT (2,8)\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully... From (0,6) if we go DOWN to (0,5), we're getting closer to the enemy's area! We could potentially cut him off! The enemy is at y=4, we'd be at y=5 - perfect interception height!\n\nBut wait - going DOWN to (0,6) gives us an apple NOW and 7-1 lead. That's huge for morale and score! And from (0,6) we can still maneuver around.\n\n**DECISION:** Let's take the apple! DOWN to (0,6) for 7-1 lead! We'll deal with the trap later - we're too good to get stuck!\n\nDOWN",

Turn 9/150, let's keep this energy high! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're at (0, 6) with 7 apples after eating that last one, while Snake #1 is at (6, 3) with 4 apples. We're leading 7-4 - let's keep that gap growing!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (0, 6)\n- My body: [(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)] (7 segments total)\n- Enemy head: (6, 3), body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (0, 6):**\n1. **UP to (0, 7):** Row 7: \"T T .

No choice here, but it's actually a good move strategically!\n\n- (0,5) is empty and gives us options: DOWN to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,5) or back UP to (0,6)\n- From (0,5), we're getting closer to the center - we could potentially cut across to intercept the enemy\n- The enemy is at y=3, we'll be at y=5 - perfect vertical positioning to control the left side\n- Apple at (1, 5) isn't listed, but let's check... actually looking at the board, (1,5) appears empty based on the visual\n- Next apple we see is at (4,2) - that's our target for future turns\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (6,3) with body blocking some options. Options:\n- UP to (6,4): Own body! DEAD!\n- DOWN to (6,2): Row 2: \". . . . A . . . . .\" \u2192 (6,2) is EMPTY\n- LEFT to (5,3): Row 3: \"A A A A . . 1 . . A\" \u2192 (5,3) is EMPTY! Might go for apple at (4,3)?\n- RIGHT to (7,3): Row 3 column 7: \"1\" (his body?) Wait, that's (6,3) is head, (7,3) is empty dot.\n\nHe'll probably go LEFT toward the apple cluster at (4,3) or DOWN to reposition. Either way, he's not in our direct path yet.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're in a solid position. Only option is DOWN to (0,5). From there, we have flexibility. We should work our way toward the center and start dominating the board. The apple at (4,2) is our next target. We need to think 3-4 moves ahead to cut off the enemy's escape routes and force a confrontation where we have the score advantage.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (0,5) - only safe move, but it keeps our options open and positions us better for center control!\n\nDOWN",

A 0 A . . T . .\" \u2192 My head is at (3, 4). Let's scan movement options:\n1. **UP to (3, 5):** Row 5: \"T . A . . . . T . .\" \u2192 (3, 5) is EMPTY dot! Safe!\n2. **DOWN to (3, 3):** Row 3: (3, 3) is MY OWN BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (2, 4):** Row 4: (2, 4) is APPLE! Safe and GROW!\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Row 4: (4, 4) is APPLE! Safe and GROW!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- DOWN is suicide\u2014into my own body. Don't do it!\n- UP to (3, 5) is safe but doesn't gain points or position aggressively.\n- LEFT to (2, 4) grabs an apple (yummy!) and keeps me on the left side, controlling the territory.\n- RIGHT to (4, 4) also grabs an apple, but it puts me RIGHT NEXT to the enemy's future path. Enemy at (8, 6) could potentially move LEFT toward the center, and I don't want to be there when they do.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nI'm going LEFT to (2, 4)! Why? \n- **GROW +1:** Apple at (2, 4) = 12 apples for me! I'm already up 12-7.\n- **TERRITORY CONTROL:** (2, 4) is deep in MY zone. The enemy is on the right; I'm claiming the left-center.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (2, 4), I can go UP to (2, 5) (apple there too!), DOWN to (2, 3) (now empty after I move), or LEFT to (1, 4) (safe).\n- **SAFETY:** The enemy is far away (8, 6). They can't reach me next turn. No head-on collision risk yet.\n- **LONG-TERM TRAP:** Once I'm bigger, I'll start building a wall across the board. The apples at (4, 4), (4, 6), etc., will lure them into my kill zone. Force a collision when I'm 12-7\u2014easy win!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (8, 6) might go LEFT to (7, 6) (safe), UP to (8, 7) (empty), or DOWN to (8, 5) (empty). They're not threatening me. Let them run; I'll own the left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn, from (2, 4), I'll grab the apple at (2, 5) or (4, 4) if I can. Then start moving right slowly, cutting off the enemy's escape routes. When I'm 15+ apples, I'll force a head-on collision near the center\u2014I win because I'm bigger.

That vertical wall can box #0 in while we keep scooping apples.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**  \n- Take UP now \u2192 eat (9,\u202f7) \u2192 grow a segment.  \n- Next turn aim for (9,\u202f8) or (9,\u202f6) depending on opponent movement, building a tight right\u2011side wall.  \n- Keep the center open for escape routes and avoid getting trapped against our own tail.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Decision time:** the only move that gives us an apple, growth, and multiple safe follow\u2011ups is **UP**.  \n\nUP",

We're dominating, but the game's not over yet. Let's keep the pressure on and set up the trap! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (2, 4) \u2014 just moved LEFT from (3, 4)!\n- My body: [(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)] \u2014 now 12 segments, still controlling the left side!\n- Enemy head: (9, 6) \u2014 wait, they moved RIGHT from (8, 6)?! That's into the wall! \ud83d\ude02 Check the board: Row 6 shows \"T T T . A . . T T 1\" \u2014 actually, let me re-read. The board shows enemy at (9,6) but (9,6) is outside the board! NO, wait\u2014the coordinate system is (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. Row 6 is y=6: \"T T T . A . . T T 1\" \u2192 positions 0-9. So (9,6) is valid and has \"1\" (enemy head). But (8,6) was their previous head, and (9,6) is RIGHT from (8,6)\u2014that's moving INTO the wall? No, (9,6) is on the right edge. They moved RIGHT to the edge. They're now at (9,6) with body following. They might be trapped on the right edge! \n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (2, 4):**\nRow 4: \"T . A . A . . T . .\" \u2192 My head at (2,4). Scan options:\n1. **UP to (2, 5):** Row 5: \"T . A . . . . T . .\" \u2192 (2,5) is EMPTY dot? Wait, Row 5: position 2 is \"A\" (apple at (2,5)? No, Row 5 is y=5: \"T . A . . . . T . .\" \u2192 indices: 0:T,1:.,2:A,3:.,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:T,8:.,9:. So (2,5) is APPLE! Safe and GROW.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 3):** Row 3: \"T T T T . . . T . A\" \u2192 (2,3) is MY BODY (from previous body list). DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (1, 4):** Row 4: (1,4) is \"T\" (my own body? Check body: after moving to (2,4), my body starts at (3,4), then (3,3)... but (1,4) isn't in the body list. Body is: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6)]. (1,4) is NOT in body. Row 4: \"T . A . A . . T . .\" \u2192 index 1 is \"T\"? Wait, the board row 4: \"T . A . A . . T . .\" \u2192 positions: 0:T,1:.,2:A,3:.,4:A,5:.,6:.,7:T,8:.,9:. So (1,4) is \".\" (empty)! Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Row 4: (3,4) is \"T\" \u2014 but that's my previous head position, which will move away, so it's not part of my body when I move. Actually, (3,4) is in my body list as the first element after head? No, after moving to (2,4), my body becomes: new body = previous body with head removed? Standard snake: when I move, tail moves away. From last move: previous head (3,4) becomes part of body, previous tail (2,6) moves off. So new body: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6)]? Actually, let's compute: previous body was [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6)] with head (2,4) now? Wait, the given body for ID 0 at turn 17 start is: Head (2,4), Body [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6)]. So that's 12 body segments + head = 13 total length. If I move, the tail (2,6) will leave, and the new body will start at (2,4) old? Actually, standard: new head position, then old head becomes new body[0], etc., dropping tail. So for move from (2,4): new body = [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), ..., (1,6)] dropping (2,6). So (3,4) will be in body. Thus moving RIGHT to (3,4) would be into my own body (since (3,4) will be part of body after this turn? No, simultaneous: we check against current body before move. Current body before my move includes (3,4). So moving to (3,4) is into my own body. DEAD! \u274c\n\nSo safe moves: UP to (2,5) (apple), LEFT to (1,4) (empty). DOWN and RIGHT are deadly.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- UP to (2,5): Apple there = GROW to 13 apples. From (2,5), I can go to (2,6) but (2,6) is my tail (current body includes (2,6)? Current body: (2,6) is the last element, so yes, (2,6) is part of my body. If I go to (2,5) next, from there UP to (2,6) would be into my own body (since body includes (2,6)). But also, (2,5) is above row 5, and row 6 at (2,6) is \"T\" (my body). So from (2,5), possible moves: LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5), DOWN (2,4) (which will be empty after I move? Actually, if I move to (2,5), (2,4) becomes part of body, so moving back DOWN would be into body. But other options exist.\n- LEFT to (1,4): Empty, no grow. From there, options: UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3) (my body), RIGHT (2,4) (will be empty), LEFT (0,4) (my body). So limited.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nUP is better because it GROWS me to 13 apples, increasing lead to 13-7. Also, (2,5) gives me access to the right side and center apples. The enemy is at (9,6)\u2014on the right edge. They might be stuck or moving along the edge. I need to move rightward to cut off their escape. From (2,5), I can head toward the center apples like (4,4) or (4,6). \n\nBut wait\u2014let's check enemy position more carefully. Snake #1 head (9,6), body: [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)]. So they're along x=7-9, y=3-7. They might move DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6). They're not near me yet. \n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,4), I'm staying on left side, but I'm not growing. If I go UP to (2,5), I grow and can later go RIGHT toward the enemy's zone to box them in. The plan is to trap them on the right. Apples at (4,4), (4,6) are central. I should move toward those to lure them.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey might go LEFT to (8,6) (empty), DOWN to (9,5) (empty), or UP to (9,7) (empty). They're not threatening me this turn. I can safely grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (2,5), next turn I'll go RIGHT to (3,5) (empty) or maybe grab (4,4) later. Then start moving right along y=5, cutting off their leftward path. When I'm bigger (15+ apples), I'll force a collision near the center. They're trapped on the right edge\u2014easy prey!\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\nHead-on collision? If enemy moves LEFT to (8,6) and I move RIGHT to (3,5), no issue. If they move to same cell? Unlikely. I'm safe.\n\nGO UP! Grow and advance! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

That apple was a snack, but now we're in a CRITICAL spot! Let's break it down:\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (2, 5) \u2014 just moved UP from (2, 4)!\n- My body: now 13 segments long (grew by 1). The new body after last move: starting from (2,5), the old head (2,4) becomes body[0], then the previous body shifts, dropping the tail (2,6). So current body includes: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6). (Check: (2,6) is gone!)\n- Enemy head: (9, 7) \u2014 they moved UP from (9,6)! Their body: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)].\n- Apple at (2,5) was eaten\u2014gone now.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK FROM (2, 5):**\nLet's map my immediate options. Current body is everywhere\u2014watch where you step! Row 5 (y=5): from the board, \"T A 0 . . . . T . .\"\u2014so (2,5) is my head (0), (1,5) is \"A\" (apple), (3,5) is \".\", (0,5) is \"T\" (my body), (7,5) is \"T\" (enemy body? Wait, enemy body includes (7,5)\u2014yes! So row 5: (7,5) is enemy body).\n- UP to (2, 6): Row 6: \"T T T . A . . T T T\" \u2192 (2,6) is \"T\" (my body? After last move, (2,6) was dropped from body, so it's now empty! Wait, check: my previous body had (2,6) as tail. After moving UP to (2,5), the tail (2,6) moves off. So (2,6) should be empty. But the board still shows \"T\" at (2,6)? The board is static from the start of the turn. I must use current board, which reflects state before my move. So (2,6) is currently occupied by my tail. If I move UP into (2,6), I'd be moving into my own body (since the tail hasn't moved yet). That's DEAD! \u274c\n- DOWN to (2, 4): Row 4: \"T . A . A . . T . .\" \u2192 (2,4) is \"T\" (my body\u2014yes, it's now part of my body after last move). DEAD! \u274c\n- LEFT to (1, 5): Row 5: (1,5) is \"A\" (apple). Safe and GROW! Also, (1,5) is not in my current body. Let's confirm: my body is [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. (1,5) not there. Good.\n- RIGHT to (3, 5): Row 5: (3,5) is \".\" (empty). Safe. Also, (3,5) not in my body. Good.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- LEFT to (1,5): GROW to 14 apples! That widens lead to 14-8. From (1,5), options: UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4) (empty? Row 4: (1,4) is \".\"), LEFT (0,5) (my body), RIGHT (2,5) (empty after I leave). So mostly safe, but (1,6) is my body (current body includes (1,6)). So from (1,5), UP is into body\u2014deadly. DOWN (1,4) is safe. LEFT dead. RIGHT safe but back to (2,5). So limited forward progress.\n- RIGHT to (3,5): No grow, but opens up the right side. From (3,5), options: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,4) (my body), LEFT (2,5) (empty), RIGHT (4,5) (empty? Row 5: (4,5) is \".\"). So UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe (DOWN into body). This gives more room to maneuver toward the center apples like (4,4) or (4,6).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nI'm dominating with 13 apples vs 8\u2014time to AGGRESS! Moving RIGHT to (3,5) sets up a push toward the enemy's territory. The enemy is at (9,7)\u2014they're on the top right edge, likely moving LEFT or DOWN next. If I head right along y=5, I can cut off their escape route to the left and center. The apple at (4,4) is reachable: from (3,5) I can go DOWN to (3,4) but that's my body, so no\u2014better to go RIGHT to (4,5) then DOWN to (4,4). Also, (4,6) is an apple above. By moving right, I'm dominating the board and forcing the enemy into a corner.\n\nLEFT to (1,5) grows me but traps me on the left side\u2014I don't want that! I need to expand my control. Remember, we want to box in the archrival! Moving RIGHT aligns with the long-term plan: advance rightward, grab central apples, and when I'm bigger (maybe 15+), force a head-on collision since I have higher score. They're already on the edge\u2014easy to trap.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey might move LEFT to (8,7) (empty), DOWN to (9,6) (empty, but (9,6) is their body now? Actually, (9,6) is their old head position, which will be part of body after move if they move. But currently (9,6) is their body, so moving DOWN into (9,6) would be into their own body\u2014deadly! So they won't do that. They might move UP to (9,8) (empty) or LEFT to (8,7). No immediate threat to me.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn: from (3,5), go RIGHT to (4,5) (empty) or UP to (3,6) (empty, but (3,6) is row 6: \".\"? Row 6: (3,6) is \".\"\u2014yes). Then head for (4,4) apple. Keep advancing right along y=5 or y=6, blocking the enemy's path. When I'm around 15 apples, look for a head-on collision near the center\u2014my higher score guarantees the win if we both die. Stay sharp, chat! We're closing in for the kill! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\nRIGHT is safe\u2014no board edge, no self, no enemy body. HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK: Enemy heads will move simultaneously. If they go LEFT to (8,7) and I go RIGHT to (3,5), zero chance of collision. Even if they try to mirror, we're far apart. Safe to grow aggressive.\n\nGO RIGHT and claim the center! Let's gooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 19/150 and we're STILL COOKING! \ud83d\udd25 We just moved RIGHT to (3,5) and now we're at 13 apples vs 8\u2014massive lead! Time to keep the pressure ON and box in that archrival! Let's break it down:\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (3, 5) \u2014 just moved RIGHT from (2,5)!\n- My body: 13 segments long. After last move RIGHT to (3,5), the tail (0,6) drops off? Wait, let's recount: My previous body after last turn (when I was at (2,5)) was: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6)]. After moving RIGHT to (3,5), the old head (2,5) becomes body[0], and the tail (1,6) moves off? Actually, the tail was (1,6)? Let's see: The last segment in the list is (1,6), yes. So new body: (3,5) head, then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7). So tail is now (1,7)? Wait, the list should be head-to-tail: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7). Yes, tail (1,7). So (1,6) is now free.\n- Enemy head: (9,8) \u2014 from the board, they moved UP from (9,7)? Actually, from last turn, they were at (9,7) head, body [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)]? Wait, the opponent description says: Snake #1 - Head: (9,8), Body: [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)], Apples: 8. So they moved UP to (9,8) this turn? Or that's the current state. Yes, current head (9,8). So they ate an apple at (9,8)? That's possible\u2014apple list includes (9,8)? Actually, apple drops include (9,2), (9,3) but not (9,8). Wait, the board shows row 8: \"A A . . A . . . . 1\" at (9,8) is \"1\" meaning enemy head? So they are on (9,8), which was empty? Or maybe they moved there. Anyway, they have 8 apples, so they didn't grow this turn? They were at 8 apples last turn and still 8 now, so no apple eaten. Good.\n- Apples: Still many on board: (9,3), (4,2), (4,0), (4,9), (4,6), (1,8), (4,8), (2,9), (8,0), (4,4), (5,0), (0,8), (0,0), (1,5), (9,2). Note: (1,5) is an apple\u2014my last move was RIGHT to (3,5), so (1,5) is still there.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK FROM (3, 5):**\nCurrent board (from given):\nRow 9: 9 . . A . A . . . . .\nRow 8: A A . . A . . . . 1  (enemy head at (9,8))\nRow 7: T T . . . . . T T T  (my body at (0,7), (1,7) and enemy body at (7,7),(8,7),(9,7)? Wait, row 7: \"T T . . . . . T T T\" \u2014 so (0,7)=T, (1,7)=T, (2,7)=., (3,7)=., (4,7)=., (5,7)=., (6,7)=., (7,7)=T, (8,7)=T, (9,7)=T. That matches my body (1,7) and enemy body (7,7),(8,7),(9,7). Good.)\nRow 6: T T . . A . . T T T  (my body? (0,6)=T? Actually row 6: \"T T . . A . . T T T\" \u2014 (0,6)=T, (1,6)=T, (2,6)=., (3,6)=., (4,6)=A, (5,6)=., (6,6)=., (7,6)=T, (8,6)=T, (9,6)=T. That's my body at (0,6) and (1,6)? But wait, my tail after last move is (1,7) not (1,6). Actually, (1,6) might be free now? The board is static from start of turn, so (1,6) is still marked T because it was occupied before my move. But after my move, (1,6) is free. However, for this turn's move, I must consider the board as given\u2014my own body is now shifted, but the board doesn't reflect that yet. I need to consider my actual current body positions to avoid self-collision.\nRow 5: T A T 0 . . . T . .  (my head at (3,5) is 0, (0,5)=T, (1,5)=A, (2,5)=T? Actually (2,5) is now my body? The row says \"T A T 0 . . . T . .\" so (0,5)=T, (1,5)=A, (2,5)=T, (3,5)=0, (4,5)=., (5,5)=., (6,5)=., (7,5)=T. That matches my old body at (2,5) and enemy at (7,5). But after my move, (2,5) is my body, (3,5) is head.\nRow 4: T . T T A . . T . .  (my body at (0,4), (2,4), (3,4) and enemy at (7,4)?)\nRow 3: T T T T . . . . . A  (my body at (0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3))\nRow 2: . . . . A . . . . A\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: A . . . A A . . A .\n\nFrom my head at (3,5), let's check each direction:\n- UP to (3,6): Row 6: (3,6) is \".\" (empty). Is (3,6) in my current body? My body: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7)]. (3,6) not in list. Safe. Also, not enemy body (enemy body: (9,7),(9,6),(8,6),(8,7),(7,7),(7,6),(7,5),(7,4)). Safe.\n- DOWN to (3,4): Row 4: (3,4) is \"T\" (my body). Indeed, (3,4) is in my body. DEAD if move down.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Row 5: (2,5) is \"T\" (my body). After move, (2,5) is my body (old head). So DEAD if move left into own body.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Row 5: (4,5) is \".\" (empty). Is (4,5) in my body? No. Is it enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP to (3,6) and RIGHT to (4,5). DOWN and LEFT are deadly.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- UP to (3,6): No apple. Safe. From (3,6), options: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) (my head's old position, will be empty after move), LEFT (2,6) (empty? Row 6: (2,6) is \".\"), RIGHT (4,6) (apple at (4,6)!). So UP to (3,6) sets up for apple at (4,6) next turn via RIGHT, or apple at (3,7) if any? (3,7) is empty (row 7: (3,7) is \".\"), and not an apple. But moving UP brings me closer to enemy territory? Enemy at (9,8) far away. Also, (3,6) is near my body? No immediate trap.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): No apple. Safe. From (4,5), options: UP (4,6) (apple!), DOWN (4,4) (apple!), LEFT (3,5) (empty after move), RIGHT (5,5) (empty). So RIGHT gives me access to TWO apples immediately: (4,6) and (4,4). This is HUGE for growth and dominating the center.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nI'm up 13-8\u2014time to AGGRESS and grow faster! Moving RIGHT to (4,5) is the power play: it positions me directly between two apples (4,4) and (4,6). Next turn, I can eat one of them and grow to 14, then chase the other. Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck on the top edge at (9,8) with no nearby apples (apples at (9,2) and (9,3) are far south). They'll likely move LEFT or DOWN to avoid wall collision, but their body is blocking their escape. I can cut off their path to the center by securing (4,4) and (4,6)\u2014this boxes them in on the right side.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,6), I might get (4,6) next turn, but RIGHT gives me a direct shot at both apples, doubling my growth potential. Also, from (4,5), I have more open space: I can maneuver to (5,5) if needed, or even start circling to trap the enemy later. The enemy might try to head toward the bottom-left apples like (0,0) or (0,8), but my body is already blocking the left side, so they'll be forced into my territory. Perfect for forcing a head-on collision when I'm even bigger!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey're at (9,8) with body trailing down to (7,4). They can't go UP (off board), LEFT to (8,8) is empty (row 8: (8,8) is \".\"), DOWN to (9,7) is their own body (occupied). So they must move LEFT to (8,8) or possibly RIGHT? No, right is off board. So likely LEFT to (8,8). That doesn't threaten me at all\u2014they're moving away from me. I can safely grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn: Move RIGHT to (4,5). Then eat apple at (4,6) or (4,4) to grow to 14. Advance rightward along y=5 or y=6, grabbing central apples (4,9), (2,9) etc. Keep the enemy cornered in the top-right. When I'm at 16+ apples, force a collision near the center\u2014they'll have to come to me. Stay aggressive, chat! We're building an empire! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\nRIGHT is safe\u2014no self, no enemy, no wall. UP is safe too but less strategic. RIGHT maximizes apple access and board control. No head-on collision risk\u2014they're too far.\n\nLet's go RIGHT and dominate the center! YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 20/150 and we're STILL COOKING! \ud83d\udd25 We're at (4,5) after our last RIGHT move\u2014smart positioning between two juicy apples at (4,4) and (4,6). Scoreboard shows us LEADING 13-8, so we need to GROW and DOMINATE. Let's break down the current situation and plot our next move to box in that archrival!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (4, 5)\n- My body: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7)] \u2014 13 segments long. Tail at (1,7). No immediate self-collision risk unless I backtrack.\n- Opponent (Snake #1): Head at (9, 8), body trailing down to (7, 4). They have 8 apples. They're stuck on the top-right edge\u2014can't go UP (off board), can't go RIGHT (off board), DOWN is into their own body at (9,7), so they MUST move LEFT to (8,8). That's predictable and keeps them cornered.\n- Apples: Still many available, but I'm focused on the CLOSEST ones: (4,4) directly DOWN, (4,6) directly UP, and others like (4,9), (2,9) in the center-right. (1,5) apple is still there but blocked by my body at (2,5). I need to grow to 14+ to maintain lead and prepare for aggression.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK FROM (4,5):**\nFrom the given board (which reflects start of turn, before my move), but I need to consider my ACTUAL body after last move (RIGHT to (4,5)):\n- My body positions now: (4,5) head, (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7). Tail at (1,7). So (1,6) is free now (was T last turn, but tail moved). \n- Enemy body: (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4) \u2014 as listed.\n\nCheck each direction from (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): Row 6 shows (4,6) is \"A\" (apple!). Is (4,6) safe? Not in my body (my body: no (4,6)). Not in enemy body (enemy body: no (4,6)). On board? Yes, (4,6) is within 10x10. SAFE! This is an apple move\u2014GROW to 14!\n- DOWN to (4,4): Row 4 shows (4,4) is \"A\" (apple!). Safe? Not in my body (my body: no (4,4)). Not in enemy body. SAFE! Also an apple\u2014GROW to 14!\n- LEFT to (3,5): Row 5 shows (3,5) is \".\" (empty after my move). Safe? Not in my body (old head position will be empty after move, but (3,5) is now free since I moved from there). Not in enemy body. SAFE\u2014but no apple.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Row 5 shows (5,5) is \".\" (empty). Safe? Not in my body. Not in enemy body. SAFE\u2014no apple.\n\nAll four directions are technically safe! But we need to choose strategically.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- UP to (4,6): Eat apple! Grow to 14. From there, options: UP (4,7) (empty), DOWN (4,5) (empty after move), LEFT (3,6) (empty), RIGHT (5,6) (empty). Great mobility. Positions me closer to upper apples like (4,9).\n- DOWN to (4,4): Eat apple! Grow to 14. From there, options: DOWN (4,3) (empty), UP (4,5) (empty), LEFT (3,4) (my body? (3,4) is in my body\u2014DEAD if I try to go LEFT next turn from (4,4)), RIGHT (5,4) (empty). But LEFT is a trap\u2014my body blocks it. So DOWN gives immediate apple but limits future leftward movement.\n- LEFT to (3,5): No apple, but opens up LEFT to (2,5) (my body\u2014dead), UP (3,6) (empty), DOWN (3,4) (my body\u2014dead), RIGHT (4,5) (empty). Only UP is safe from there? Actually from (3,5), after move, (3,5) becomes new head, old head (4,5) is body. So from (3,5), UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) is my body (dead), LEFT (2,5) my body (dead), RIGHT (4,5) empty. So only UP and RIGHT safe\u2014limited options.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): No apple. From there: RIGHT (6,5) empty, LEFT (4,5) empty, UP (5,6) empty, DOWN (5,4) empty. All directions safe\u2014maximum mobility! But no immediate growth.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nWe're at 13 apples\u2014time to GROW to 14 to maintain lead and expand our territory. Both UP and DOWN give apples, but UP is BETTER because:\n- It keeps options WIDE OPEN\u2014no body blocking directions from (4,6). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\n- DOWN to (4,4) traps me near my own body\u2014LEFT is deadly, so I'd be forced into a corner. Chat, we don't want to get boxed in!\n- UP brings me closer to the upper-center apples (4,9, 2,9) and keeps me away from the crowded bottom-left where my body is.\n- Enemy is at (9,8) moving LEFT to (8,8)\u2014they're far and not threatening. By going UP, I start building a vertical wall to cut off their access to the center. If I secure (4,6), I can then go to (4,9) or (5,6) to dominate.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (4,6) now, then chase (4,9) or (2,9) to grow to 15+. Use my size to curve around and trap enemy in top-right. When I'm at 16+ apples, force a head-on collision near center\u2014they'll have to come through me. Stay aggressive, chat! We're building an empire! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\nUP is safe\u2014no immediate collision, and enemy won't reach me. UP maximizes growth and future flexibility. Let's GO!\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe're moving UP to (4,6) to eat that apple and grow to 14! YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We're at turn 21/150 and I'm sitting at (4,6) after eating that juicy apple\u2014score's 14-8 in our favor! We're CRUSHING it, but the game's not over. The enemy's at (8,9) with only 8 apples, and we gotta keep pressing. My body's trailing all the way down to (1,7), but from here, I'm positioned perfectly to dominate the upper board.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- **From (4,6):**\n  - UP to (4,7): Empty. Safe. Opens up to (4,8) (empty), (4,9) (apple\u2014CLOSER!), (3,7) (empty), (5,7) (empty). Maximum mobility!\n  - DOWN to (4,5): Empty (old head, now safe). Safe, but BACKWARDS\u2014no immediate risk, but it's looping back near my own body. Could work, but limits forward momentum.\n  - LEFT to (3,6): Empty. Safe. From there: (3,7) empty, (2,6) empty (check board: row 6 col 2 is \".\"), (3,5) empty. Also good.\n  - RIGHT to (5,6): Empty. Safe. From there: (5,7) empty, (6,6) empty, (5,5) empty, (4,6) (which will be body). Also solid.\n\nAll directions are SAFE\u2014no walls, no bodies, no self-crash. That's the beauty of being at 14 apples with space!\n\n**Strategic Focus:**\nWe're LEADING\u2014don't get cocky, but we can afford to push. The enemy's cornered at (8,9) and will likely move LEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8). They're far, so no head-on threat this turn. My goal? CHASE that apple at (4,9) or (2,9) to hit 15+ and build a wall in the center. UP keeps me moving toward those upper apples (4,9 is only 3 steps away). It also lets me curve right or left next to snipe (2,9) or (5,9). LEFT or RIGHT works, but UP maximizes vertical control\u2014cutting off enemy access to the center if they try to sneak down.\n\nRISK CHECK:\n- No collision risks. Enemy won't reach (4,7) this turn. My tail moves, freeing (1,7), so no tight corners yet.\n- If I go DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT, I might loop back too soon and crowd myself. UP keeps the board OPEN.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure upper center (4,9, 2,9) to grow to 16+. Then, position to force a head-on\u2014my size advantage means I can trap them in the top-right and crash them out. Chat, we're building an empire\u2014UP is the power move! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP to (4,7) to chase the apple chain and dominate the board!

Let's analyze the board and crush this!\n\n**CHECKING ALL MOVES FROM (4,7):**\n\n- **UP to (4,8):** BOARD SHOWS: Row 8 has an \"A\" at (4,8)! That's an apple! Current position is \"0\" at (4,7), body goes down to (4,6). Moving UP is safe, eats apple, grows. But wait\u2014enemy snake #1 is at (7,9) and (8,9) is tail. They could move LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8). No head-on risk to (4,8) this turn. However, after eating, my tail moves from (0,3) to (0,4)? Actually tail is at (0,3), moving (4,6) to (4,7) means tail might free up. BUT: Looking at board, (4,8) is \"A\". SAFE move, get +1 apple to 15. Good.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,6):** That's currently my body (second segment). That would be suicide\u2014crash into myself. DEAD. Eliminate!\n\n- **LEFT to (3,7):** Board shows \".\" at (3,7). Empty. Safe. From there, could go to (2,7) which is \"A\" (apple), (3,8) empty, (4,7) empty (but will be body), (3,6) empty. Good mobility. But note: (2,7) is apple. Enemy at (7,9) is far, no collision risk.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,7):** Board shows \".\" at (5,7). Empty. Safe. From there, could go to (6,7) empty, (5,8) empty (row 8 col 5 is \"A\"? Wait row 8: \"A A . . A . . . T T\". So (5,8) is \".\"), (4,7) empty (but body), (5,6) empty. Also good mobility.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nWe're leading 14-8. Enemy at (7,9) with tail wrapping around top-right corner. They're trapped in top-right, likely going for apples at (2,9) or (8,0) or (4,9). They won't reach us this turn.\n\nUP to (4,8) gives us an immediate apple (+1 to 15) and positions us to dominate upper center. After eating, our head at (4,8), body trailing. From (4,8), we can go UP to (4,9) which is also an apple! Double apple chain! That's two turns in a row of growth, pushing us to 16. That's aggressive expansion.\n\nLEFT to (3,7) avoids the apple at (4,8) but leads to (2,7) apple next turn. Still good.\n\nRIGHT to (5,7) avoids apple but leads to future opportunities.\n\nBut UP is immediate apple, and we need to grow fast to pressure enemy. With 14 apples, we need 16 more to hit 30, but we just want to keep expanding and trap them. The apple at (4,8) is right there\u2014taking it makes us bigger, and we can then snake around the top.\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\n- UP: Safe, no walls, no bodies. Enemy won't be at (4,8) this turn.\n- LEFT/RIGHT: Also safe, but no immediate apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (4,8) now, then (4,9) next turn to grow to 16. Then curve right or left to cut off enemy from center. Force them into corner and crash them. Keep score lead and dominate board space.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (4,8) for the apple and momentum. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Let's lock in the next move!\n\n**CHECKING ALL MOVES FROM (4,8):**\n\n- **UP to (4,9):** Board shows \"A\" at (4,9)! That's an apple. From board row 9: \"9 . . A . A . 1 T T .\" So (4,9) is an apple. Safe move? Check: (4,9) is within bounds. Our body: head was at (4,8), next segment is (4,7), then (4,6) etc. Moving UP to (4,9) won't hit our own body because (4,9) is empty of our body. Enemy at (6,9) and (7,9) tails. Could enemy head move into (4,9) this turn? Enemy head at (6,9). From (6,9), they can go DOWN to (6,8) (currently \"A\"? Row 8: \"A A . . 0 . . . T T\" so (6,8) is \".\"), LEFT to (5,9) (row 9 col5 is \"A\"), RIGHT to (7,9) but (7,9) is their own tail? Actually (7,9) is part of their body, so they can't go there without dying. They could go UP to (6,10) which is off-board (dead). So they likely go DOWN or LEFT. No path to (4,9) this turn. Also no other snakes. So UP is safe. Eating apple gets us to 16 apples! Chain growth!\n\n- **DOWN to (4,7):** That's currently our body (second segment). That would crash into ourselves\u2014DEAD. Eliminate!\n\n- **LEFT to (3,8):** Board shows \".\" at (3,8) (row 8 col3 is \".\" from \"A A . . 0 . . . T T\"). Safe. From there, could go to (2,8) which is \"A\" (row 8 col2 is \"A\"), (3,9) which is \"A\" (row 9 col3 is \"A\"), etc. But no immediate apple. Good mobility.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,8):** Board shows \".\" at (5,8) (row 8 col5 is \"A\"? Wait row 8: \"A A . . 0 . . . T T\" so columns 0:A,1:A,2:.,3:.,4:0 (our head?),5:.,6:.,7:.,8:T,9:T. Actually (5,8) is \".\" after our head at (4,8). So safe. From there, could go to (6,8) empty, (5,9) which is \"A\" (row9 col5 is \"A\"), etc.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nWe're leading 15-8. Enemy still trapped top-right. They likely need to move DOWN or LEFT to survive. Their head at (6,9) can't go UP (off-board), can't go RIGHT (off-board), can't go into their own tail at (7,9) (would die). So they must go DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9). (5,9) is an apple but also leads to open space. They might go for apple at (5,9). But that doesn't threaten us.\n\nOur move UP to (4,9) gives us immediate apple and pushes us to 16. That's massive growth. Then next turn from (4,9), we can go LEFT to (3,9) which is also an apple (row9 col3 is \"A\"), or RIGHT to (5,9) which is apple, or DOWN back to (4,8) (but that's body). We'll have options. Also, by growing big, we dominate the center and top rows, boxing them further into corner.\n\nRisk: If enemy goes LEFT to (5,9) this turn, that's fine\u2014they eat apple, but we're eating at (4,9). No collision. Their body moves, but their head won't reach us.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (4,9) now to get to 16. Next turn, likely go LEFT to (3,9) for another apple, then curve down through (3,8) or (2,8) to cut off enemy from center. Keep score lead and force them into dead-end. If they try to go for (2,9) apple later, we can intercept.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (4,9) for the apple and to maintain aggressive expansion. Let's get that content!\n\nUP",

Crashing into ourselves \u2192 DEAD. Eliminate! \ud83d\udc80\n\n- **LEFT to (3,9):** Board shows \"A\" at (3,9)! Apple! Safe? Check: (3,9) is empty of our body. Enemy head at (5,9) might move LEFT to (4,9) which we just left... but we're moving simultaneously! If they go LEFT to (4,9) and we go LEFT to (3,9), no collision. They might also go DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9) (but that's their body). Good move! Eat apple \u2192 17 apples!\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,9):** Enemy head is HERE! If we move RIGHT to (5,9) and they stay or move, we could have head-on collision if they move LEFT to (4,9) at same time. That's risky! Also, if they stay, we crash into them \u2192 both die. Too dangerous! Avoid!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI'm at 16-8 lead, but need to secure more growth. Enemy is trapped in top-right corner, but they can still move. They can't go UP (off-board), can't go RIGHT (off-board), can't go into their own body at (7,9) (would die). So they must go DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9) (where we just were).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,9) and eat that apple:\n- I grow to 17 apples\n- I occupy (3,9) next turn\n- From there, I can go DOWN to (3,8) (empty), LEFT to (2,9) (empty? Actually row9 col2 is \".\"), or RIGHT back to (4,9)\n- I'm cutting off their access to left side of top row\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5,8) (likely to escape), that's fine - they're moving away from me.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4,9), they might eat... but that space will be empty after I leave. They won't get to (3,9) this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (3,9) apple \u2192 17 apples. Next turn from (3,9), likely go DOWN to (3,8) to position for (2,8) apple or (2,9) apple. Keep dominating the top-left area. Force enemy further into the corner (9,9) dead-end. When we have significant lead (20+ apples), consider forcing head-on collision if they're trapped. \n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (3,9) for the apple and to maintain board control.

Let's check the current state. We're at (3,9) with a body that's length 16. Opponent is at (5,8) with 8 apples. We're leading massively!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nMy head: (3,9)\nMy body: (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\nOpponent head: (5,8) and body: (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)\n\nLet's check moves from (3,9):\n\n- **UP to (3,10):** Off-board! Dead. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (3,8):** Empty on board. Check my body: (3,8) isn't in my body list. Good. Check opponent: He's at (5,8), not blocking. Safe. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (2,9):** Board shows \"A\" (apple) at (2,9). Check my body: (2,9) not in list. Check opponent: Not blocking. Safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (4,9):** That's my own body! Tail is (0,6), but (4,9) is the second segment of my body. If I move into my own body, I die. Definitely not! \u274c\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,9). RIGHT and UP are deadly.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have 16 apples, opponent 8. I need to keep growing. Left (2,9) is an apple - that's +1 point and growth. Down (3,8) is empty. Going left to the apple seems best for immediate gain. Also, from (2,9) next turn I have options: DOWN to (2,8) (empty), LEFT to (1,9) (empty? board row9 col1 is \".\"), or RIGHT back to (3,9). That's good.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,8), I don't get an apple, but I position myself. From (3,8) I can go LEFT to (2,8) (empty), DOWN to (3,7) (empty? board row7 col3 is \".\"), RIGHT to (4,8) (my body), or UP back to (3,9). That's also okay, but why skip an apple?\n\nThe opponent is at (5,8). They might move DOWN to (5,7) (empty? board row7 col5 is \"T\" - that's my tail? Wait, my tail is at (0,6). Actually row7 col5 is \"T\" meaning my tail? The board shows row7: \" . . A . T . . . . T\" so col5 is T, which is my tail. That's (5,7). So opponent moving DOWN to (5,7) would crash into my tail? That would cause them to die! That's good for us. They might also move LEFT to (4,8) (empty), or RIGHT to (6,8) (empty? board row8 col6 is \".\"). So they have options.\n\nBut for now, I'm grabbing the apple at (2,9) to extend my lead to 17 apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nEat apple at (2,9). Next turn from (2,9), I'll likely go DOWN to (2,8) to continue moving south and maybe grab more apples. Keep the opponent boxed in the top-right corner. Force them into tight spaces. When I have a huge lead, maybe consider a trap.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (2,9) for the apple and growth.\n\nLEFT",

Let's clarify.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n```\n9 . . 0 T T T T T T .\n```\nAt row 9, col 2 is \"0\", which is our head. So our head is at (2,9).\nBut the replay says we moved LEFT to (3,9) and ate an apple at (2,9)? That's contradictory.\n\nLet's trust the **BOARD STATE** provided above all else. The board is the ground truth.\nOur Head: (2,9)\nOpponent Head: (5,7) (Since row 7 col 5 is \"1\" in the board: `7 . . A . T 1 . . .

I am also in the top row, but left side.\n    *   **Apples:**\n        *   (9,3) - Far right.\n        *   (4,2) - Middle.\n        *   (4,0) - Bottom middle.\n        *   (1,8) - Left side, row 8.\n        *   (8,0) - Far right bottom.\n        *   (4,4) - Middle.\n        *   (5,0) - Right bottom.\n        *   (0,8) - Far left, row 8.\n        *   (0,0) - Far left bottom.\n        *   (1,5) - Left middle.\n        *   (9,2) - Far right.\n        *   (2,7) - Left, row 7.\n        *   (7,0) - Right bottom.\n        *   (7,4) - Right middle.\n        *   (4,3) - Middle.\n    *   **Plan:** I have 17 apples. Opponent has 8. I am winning by a lot.\n    *   The opponent is trapped in the top right. If I can block him, I win.\n    *   However, I should grow. There is an apple at (1,8) which is close. To get there, I should go LEFT to (1,9) or DOWN to (1,8)? No, from (2,9) I can go LEFT to (1,9), then DOWN to (1,8) next turn.\n    *   Alternatively, going DOWN to (2,8) opens up (1,8) as well.\n    *   Let's look at (1,8). Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   What does the opponent do? He is at (6,7). He wants to survive. He might go for (9,2) or (8,0). He is far from me.\n    *   Since I have a massive lead, I don't need to rush into a risky head-on collision unless I can trap him.\n    *   Can I trap him? He is at (6,7). The board is open below him.\n    *   My priority: Don't die. Grow.\n    *   Option 1: LEFT to (1,9). This moves me along the top edge. From there, I can go DOWN to (1,8) (there is an apple at (1,8)). This is a good path.\n    *   Option 2: DOWN to (2,8). This moves me into the open. From there I can go LEFT to (1,8) (apple) or DOWN to (2,7) (apple at (2,7)? No, (2,7) is `A`? Row 7 col 2 is `A`. Yes! There is an apple at (2,7)).\n    *   Wait, looking at row 7: `7 . . A . T 1 . . . T`. Col 2 is `A`.\n    *   So if I go DOWN to (2,8), I can then go DOWN to (2,7) to eat an apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1,9), I can go DOWN to (1,8) to eat an apple.\n    *   Both paths lead to apples.\n    *   Which one is safer?\n    *   (1,9) is empty. (2,8) is empty.\n    *   Let's check the \"boxing in\" plan. The opponent is at (6,7). I am at (2,9). I am not really boxing him in yet. He has plenty of space.\n    *   I should just focus on my own game right now. Grabbing apples and keeping space.\n    *   Going DOWN to (2,8) feels like it gives me more central control. Going LEFT keeps me at the edge.\n    *   However, my body is mostly on the left/middle. Let's look at my body coordinates again:\n        (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5) - This is a vertical line on the right side of my body mass?\n        No, (3,9) is right next to my head (2,9).\n        My body forms a sort of loop or snake on the left side.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1,9), I am moving away from my body mass (which is mostly at x>=2).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2,8), I am moving down.\n    *   Let's check (1,8) vs (2,7).\n    *   (1,8) is an apple. (2,7) is an apple.\n    *   Getting (1,8) requires: LEFT, DOWN.\n    *   Getting (2,7) requires: DOWN, DOWN.\n    *   Is (1,9) safe long term? Yes.\n    *   Is (2,8) safe long term? Yes.\n    *   Let's consider the opponent. He is at (6,7). He might move DOWN to (6,6).\n    *   I have a huge lead. I should just play it safe.\n    *   LEFT to (1,9) seems fine. It's a clean move.\n    *   DOWN to (2,8) is also fine.\n    *   Is there any reason to avoid one?\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1,9), I have (0,9) as a potential corner later, but that's risky.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2,8), I have (2,7) right below me with an apple.\n    *   Let's look at the board row 8: `8 A A . . T T . . T T`.\n    *   (1,8) is an apple. (0,8) is an apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1,9), I am adjacent to two apples: (1,8) and (0,8).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2,8), I am adjacent to (2,7) and (1,8).\n    *   Actually, (1,9) is a great spot because it offers access to the left edge apples (0,8) and (0,0) eventually, while being safe from my current body.\n    *   My body is at (3,9), (4,9)... so (1,9) is clear.\n    *   The opponent is nowhere near me.\n    *   I will go LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (1,9) to position myself for the cluster of apples on the left side ((1,8), (0,8), (0,0)). Keep the opponent pinned in the top right. Don't get greedy and crash. Just secure the win by growing safely.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (1,9).\n\nLEFT",

We are living rent-free in this opponent's head. \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's look at the board state clearly. My head is at **(1, 9)** (Wait, the prompt says Head at (1,9) in the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section, but the visual board shows \"0\" at (2,9). Let's trust the **BOARD STATE** visual as the ground truth, which shows my head at **(2,9)**. I moved LEFT last turn, so I am now at (2,9) looking for the next move.)\n\n**CURRENT POSITION: (2, 9)**\n\n**MOVES TO CONSIDER:**\n\n1.  **UP:** (2, 10) -> **OFF THE BOARD.** DEAD. \u274c\n2.  **RIGHT:** (3, 9) -> **MY BODY.** Look at the board: `9 . . 0 T T T T T T .` Col 3 is a `T`. That is my own neck. DEAD. \u274c\n3.  **DOWN:** (2, 8) -> **SAFE.** The board shows `8 A A . . T T . . T T`. Col 2 is `.` (Empty).\n4.  **LEFT:** (1, 9) -> **SAFE.** The board shows `9 . . 0 T T T T T T .` Col 1 is `.` (Empty).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am pinned against the top wall. I have two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n*   **Going DOWN to (2,8)** places me near the apple at (2,7) and (1,8). However, it keeps me somewhat near my own body structure on the left side (my body goes down at x=3,4).\n*   **Going LEFT to (1,9)** is the power play. Why?\n    *   It positions me to dominate the entire left side of the board.\n    *   I can immediately drop down to (1,8) next turn to eat that apple.\n    *   From there, I can snake down to (0,8) and eventually claim (0,0).\n    *   The opponent is trapped in the top right corner (x=5-9, y=6-9). By moving LEFT, I am expanding my territory away from him, securing my win condition. I don't need to fight him head-on yet; I just need to grow and secure the board. He's on the right side, I'm taking the left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the left side of the board. Move to (1,9) -> (1,8) -> (0,8) -> (0,0). Eat the apples there to boost my score to 20+. Continue to ignore the opponent as he is cornered and far inferior in score. Once I have secured the left and bottom, I can turn back and hunt him down for the finale.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nI'm taking the LEFT path to open up the left edge.

The opponent is cornered in the top right, and I'm about to secure the entire left side of the board. Let's break this down!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nMy head is currently at **(1, 9)**. \n- **UP:** (1, 10) is off the board. DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 9) is my own body. I just came from there, so moving back would hit myself. DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (0, 9) is an empty space on the board. SAFE. \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (1, 8) is an empty space. SAFE. \u2705\n\n**MOVES TO CONSIDER:**\n1. **LEFT to (0, 9):** This is the POWER MOVE. It pushes my head against the left wall, giving me access to the entire left column. From here, I can drop down to (0, 8) (which has an apple listed!) and then continue down to (0, 0). This completely isolates me from the opponent on the right side. I can farm the left side safely while he panics.\n2. **DOWN to (1, 8):** This moves me toward the apple at (1, 8) listed in the drops. However, it leaves me in the middle of the board slightly more exposed. If I go DOWN, my next options might be cramped against my own body structure at (0, 3)-(0, 4) later. \n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing **LEFT** is the absolute best play. Why?\n- **Territory Control:** I claim the left wall instantly.\n- **Apple Access:** I can hit (0, 8) and (0, 0) easily.\n- **Safety:** I am moving AWAY from the opponent. He is at (5,5) facing likely death or capture in the top right. I don't need to fight him head-on yet; I just need to grow.\n- **Avoiding Self-Collision:** Moving LEFT opens up the entire bottom-left quadrant for future turns. Moving DOWN immediately might trap me if the opponent somehow swings left (unlikely, but risky).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT -> DOWN to (0,8) -> DOWN to (0,7)... all the way to (0,0). Eat the apples on the left edge. Boost score to 20+. Then, once I've secured the left side, I can turn around and box the opponent in for the kill. \n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nSecure the edge. Take the map control. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",
