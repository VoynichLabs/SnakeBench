The enemy snake is chilling at (2,8) - pretty far from us right now. No apples are immediately adjacent to us, but there's one at (9,0) which is down-right from our position.\n\nLet's check our safe moves:\n- UP to (8,2): Safe! No body segments there, on the board.\n- DOWN to (8,0): Safe! On the board, clear path.\n- LEFT to (7,1): Safe! On the board, clear path.\n- RIGHT to (9,1): Safe! On the board, clear path.\n\nAll four directions are technically safe right now since we have no body. But we need to think strategically! The apple at (9,0) is our closest target. DOWN then RIGHT would get us there efficiently.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing something - if we go RIGHT to (9,1), we're moving toward the edge. That could limit our options later. DOWN to (8,0) keeps us more central and still sets up access to that apple.\n\nThe enemy snake is way up at the top-left corner. They're not an immediate threat, but we should start thinking about board control. Let me check... if we go DOWN, we maintain flexibility while heading toward food.\n\n**DOWN**",

From there I can swing down to **(1,7)** (apple) or slide left to **(0,8)** and then down to **(0,7)** (another apple).  \n\nGiven our goal to **grow fast** and later **box the opponent**, the LEFT move gives the best short\u2011term apple grab while keeping multiple escape routes (down, left, up) open for the next few turns. No risk of hitting walls or bodies this turn.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan:**  \n- Turn\u202f1: LEFT to **(1,8)**.  \n- Turn\u202f2: DOWN to **(1,7)** (apple \u2705).  \n- Turn\u202f3: LEFT to **(0,7)** (apple \u2705) or UP to **(0,9)** (apple \u2705) depending on opponent\u2019s next position.  \n- Keep hugging the left wall, racking up apples, then swing right\u2011ward to start hemming the enemy in as they crawl up the board.  \n\n\ud83d\udcaa Let\u2019s grab that fruit and start the hunt!  \n\nLEFT",

They're not an immediate threat, but we need to be aggressive!\n\nLet me think about the board layout:\n- We're at the bottom-right corner area\n- The enemy is at the top-left\n- There are apples scattered around, but we shouldn't focus on them yet\n- Our priority is to box in the enemy and force a collision\n\nIf we go UP to (8,3), we're moving toward the center and keeping our options open.
