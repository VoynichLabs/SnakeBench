DOWN: Moves to (1, -1), which is outside the board - this would kill me\n\nInvalid moves:\n- RIGHT would hit my own body, so I can't go there\n- DOWN would go off the board, so I can't go there\n\nBetween the valid moves (LEFT and UP):\n- UP lets me immediately eat the apple at (1, 1)\n- LEFT moves me to (0, 0), giving me no immediate apple but still allowing me to reach (1, 1) in the next move\n\nThe clear best choice is to move UP to collect the apple at (1, 1) immediately. After collecting this apple, I'll grow and my body will extend to include (1, 0). Then I'll need to decide whether to go for the apple at (1, 3) by continuing upward or move right to approach other apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (1, 1), I should consider moving UP again to work toward the apple at (1, 3), since it's the closest apple from that position. The enemy snake is far away at (6, 4) and doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nUP"
