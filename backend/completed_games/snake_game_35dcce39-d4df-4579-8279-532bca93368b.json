Let's break down the situation before we make our first move! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- We're at (1, 5) - pretty central-left position with open space around us\n- Enemy is at (9, 3) - far right side, near the bottom\n- There are apples scattered everywhere! (9, 2) is right below the enemy's head! That's spicy! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n- We're both at 0 apples - this is early game, gotta establish dominance!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- **UP to (1, 6)**: Safe, open space above. Would put us moving toward apples at (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 2)\n- **DOWN to (1, 4)**: Safe, open space below. Would move us toward (1, 0) apple eventually\n- **LEFT to (0, 5)**: Border wall, but still safe (not out of bounds). Limits future moves though\n- **RIGHT to (2, 5)**: Safe, open space, and there's an apple at (2, 5)! This could be our first apple!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nThe enemy is way over at (9, 3) - they're not an immediate threat. But I notice (9, 2) is an apple RIGHT below them! They might go DOWN for it. If they do, they'll be at (9, 2) and we'll be at (2, 5) if we go RIGHT. That's perfect - we're claiming territory while they're chasing an apple.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2, 5) is AGGRESSIVE! We grab an apple on turn 1, extend our body, and start claiming the left side of the board. The enemy is stuck on the far right - we can control the center and left!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Take that apple at (2,5) to grow, then sweep upward through the center to claim the dense apple clusters at (3,5), (4,2), (4,9) while keeping the enemy pinned on the right side. Force them into a corner!\n\nRIGHT",

DON'T DO IT!\n- **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: Open space AND there's an apple at (3,5)! This is the move!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nLEFT is death - we'd run into our own tail immediately. UP and DOWN are safe but don't grab apples. RIGHT to (3,5) gives us another apple, extending our lead to 2-1! \n\nThe enemy is still at (9, 2) - they might go DOWN to grab that apple at (9,2) or LEFT toward (8,2). Either way, they're still stuck on the right edge. We're sweeping the center-left, claiming territory and apples while they're cornered!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep moving right to claim apples at (3,5), (4,2), (4,9) while staying central.

We're moving toward the apple cluster at (5,5), (4,9), (5,7), (7,7). This keeps us central and aggressive!\n2. **DOWN to (3,4)**: Open space! We could go for apple at (4,2) or (1,0). But moving down takes us away from the main apple cluster...\n3. **LEFT to (2,5)**: Into our own body! The cell (2,5) has our body - CRASH! \u274c DEAD! Eliminate immediately!\n4. **RIGHT to (4,5)**: Open space! Could go for apples at (5,5) or (4,2) or (4,9). But enemy is at (8,2) and might move left... danger zone?\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nLEFT is instant death - we'd hit our own tail (2,5)! That's a classic streamer fail! \ud83d\ude02\n\nDOWN (3,4) is safe but puts us at y=4, away from the juicy apple cluster at y=5,7,9. Plus enemy at (8,2) might come our way if they go UP...\n\nRIGHT (4,5) is safe but moves us TOWARD the enemy on the right side. He's at (8,2) and could go UP to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,2). We're not too close yet but...\n\nUP (3,6) is MY FAVORITE! Why? \n- It's safe (open space)\n- Moves us TOWARD the massive apple cluster at y=5,7,9 (apples at (5,5), (5,7), (4,9), etc.)\n- Keeps us CENTRAL and flexible\n- Enemy is still on the right edge at (8,2) - we're controlling the map!\n- Sets us up to go RIGHT next turn toward (4,6) or UP to (3,7) to chase apples\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (NEXT TURNS):**\n\u2192 Turn 2: Go UP to (3,6) - claim center-left territory\n\u2192 Turn 3: Go RIGHT to (4,6) - head toward apple at (5,7) and (5,5)\n\u2192 Turn 4-5: Chase apples at (5,7) or (4,9) while keeping distance from enemy on right\n\u2192 Once we hit 3-4 apples, start boxing enemy in on right side by taking the map!\n\nThe enemy is cornered at (8,2) near the bottom-right.

Left side is empty, center-right has the action. We're at (3,6) right in the juice!\n- Enemy is at (8,1) - bottom-right edge, we're central-left. Space is OURS!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (ELIMINATE THE SUICIDES):**\n\n1. **UP to (3,7)**: CHECK IT! (3,7) is OPEN! We see apples at (5,7), (7,7), (8,7) nearby! This is WIDE OPEN territory! \u2b50 SAFE!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,5)**: CRASH! Our own body (3,5) is there! That's death! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD!\n\n3. **LEFT to (2,6)**: CHECK IT! (2,6) is OPEN! No snake there! But... wait. If we go LEFT, we're moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (5,7), (7,7), etc. Plus, left side is mostly empty - we might waste turns. \u26a0\ufe0f SAFE but risky later!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,6)**: CHECK IT! (4,6) is OPEN! We see apples at (5,7), (5,5), (4,9)! This moves us TOWARD the action! \u2b50 SAFE!\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- DOWN is instant death into own body! \u274c GONE!\n- LEFT is safe but moves us to the empty wasteland - we lose apple access! We NEED those apples to stay ahead! \u274c GONE!\n- UP and RIGHT are both WIDE OPEN!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nUP gets us to (3,7) - we see apples at (5,7) (2 steps away), (7,7) (4 steps away), (8,7) (5 steps away). We're moving UP into the y=7 row which is LOADED with apples! This gives us options to go RIGHT or LEFT next turn!\n\nRIGHT gets us to (4,6) - we're closer to (5,5) (right above), (4,9) (4 up), (5,7) (diagonal). Also great! But we're moving right toward the enemy's area slightly. Enemy at (8,1) could go UP and right toward us...\n\n**DECISION TIME!**\nUP is my call! Why?\n- Gets us HIGH on the board (y=7) where apples are PLENTIFUL\n- Keeps us CENTRAL - we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP next turn\n- Enemy is LOW at y=1 - we're controlling the vertical space!\n- Opens up path to (5,7), (7,7), (8,7) - triple apple threat!\n- We maintain our LEAD and stay aggressive!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (TURN 4+):**\n\u2192 Turn 3: Go UP to (3,7) - claim high ground\n\u2192 Turn 4: Go RIGHT to (4,7) or (5,7) - chase that apple!\n\u2192 Turn 5: Clean up the y=7 apple cluster while enemy struggles at bottom\n\u2192 Once we hit 3-4 apples, we DOMINATE and trap enemy on the right edge!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING 4D CHESS WHILE HE'S PLAYING TIC-TAC-TOE!

None of those cells are anywhere near my (8,0) target, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**Risk assessment**  \n- No wall, no body, no opponent on (8,0).  \n- Eating the apple gives +1 point (we\u2019re behind 1\u20112), and the extra segment makes it harder for the enemy to corner us later.  \n\n**Strategic outlook**  \nGrab the apple, grow to three segments, then start sweeping left along the bottom row. That forces the rival into a tight corridor while we keep options open up the board for future apple grabs.  \n\n**Decision:** The safest, highest\u2011reward move is the obvious one \u2013 down into that juicy apple.  \n\nDOWN",

They might try to intercept us if we go too far down. However, we are currently safe. Moving **RIGHT** to (7,7) secures the apple. It keeps us in the high-value cluster area (7,7, 8,7, 8,6).

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! Turn 9 and the pressure is ON! \ud83d\udd25 We're leading 6-3, but snake #1 is still lurking. We just ate at (8,7) and grew to length 7. Now we need to secure the next move and keep dominating the board.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (8,7) (just moved here).\n- Body: [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6)] (Length 7).\n- Enemy snake #1: Head: (3,0), Body: [(4,0), (5,0), (6,0)]. Still at the bottom left.\n- Apples nearby: (8,6) directly below, (9,7) to the right, (9,2) bottom-right, (7,5) down-left.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES from (8,7):**\n1. **UP to (8,8):** Open on the board (marked '.'). Safe from my body. Safe from enemy. Moves towards the top wall. Good for controlling the top edge.\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** **APPLE!** (8,6) is marked 'A'. Safe from my body. Safe from enemy. This grows us to Length 8. Secures another point immediately.\n3. **LEFT to (7,7):** CRASH! That is my own body (the neck immediately behind my head). I die. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (9,7):** **APPLE!** (9,7) is marked 'A'. Safe from my body. Safe from enemy. This grows us to Length 8. Secures a point and pushes us to the far right wall.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe are at (8,7) with a clear shot at two apples: DOWN to (8,6) and RIGHT to (9,7). Both are safe and grow us. Which one is better?\n- Moving DOWN to (8,6) puts us at x=8, y=6. From there, we can potentially go LEFT to (7,6) or DOWN to (8,5) (though (8,5) is currently empty but near the apple at (7,5)). It keeps us slightly more central.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,7) puts us at the wall (x=9, y=7). From there, we can only go UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), or LEFT (suicide). Being on the wall limits future flexibility slightly more than being at x=8.\n\nHowever, the apple at (9,7) is sitting right there on the wall. If we don't take it now, we might have to loop back for it later. But the apple at (8,6) is also valuable. Let's look at the board geometry. The top-right corner is ours to control. The apple at (9,7) is closer to the corner than (8,6). By taking (9,7), we establish presence on the far wall. From (9,7), we can sweep the right edge (UP or DOWN). From (8,6), we are one step away from the wall.\n\nActually, looking at the board, (9,7) is an apple. (8,6) is an apple. Both are good. But (9,7) puts us *on* the boundary. (8,6) keeps us one step off the boundary. In Snake, controlling the wall is often powerful because it limits movement options for the enemy (they can't cross the wall) and simplifies pathing for us.\n\nLet's look at the enemy. Snake #1 is at (3,0). They are nowhere near us. We have time.\n\nDecision: **RIGHT** to (9,7). Why? It's an apple. It puts us on the rightmost wall. From there, we can sweep down or up. It's a strong territorial move. (8,6) is also an apple, but (9,7) feels like claiming the perimeter.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (TURN 9+):**\n\u2192 Turn 9: Go RIGHT to (9,7) to EAT the apple and secure the right wall.\n\u2192 Turn 10: From (9,7), likely go DOWN to (9,6) or UP to (9,8) to sweep the edge and look for more apples. Keep snake #1 pinned at the bottom left. Don't let them breathe.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're on turn 11, leading 7-4, and we just chomped that apple at (9,6)! The score is now 8-4 in our favor. We are HUNTING. We need to secure the right wall and start closing the trap on Snake #1. Let's look at the board from our current head at (9,6).\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (9,6):**\n1.  **UP to (9,7):** **INVALID.** That is the start of my own body. I just came from there. If I go back, I die instantly. NO THANKS.\n2.  **DOWN to (9,5):** **INVALID.** My body stretches all the way down to (3,7) and (3,6), then wraps. Wait, looking at the body list: `[(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]`. Actually, the tail is at (3,7). The cell (9,5) is currently empty according to the map (it shows an 'A' at (9,2) further down). Wait, let me re-read the body. My body is: Head (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (8,7)... -> (3,7). So (9,5) is **EMPTY**. It's a valid move.\n3.  **LEFT to (8,6):** **APPLE.** The map shows an 'A' at (8,6). Valid move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10,6):** **DEAD.** Off the board. NO.\n\nSo we have two valid moves: DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Option LEFT (to 8,6):** I eat an apple. Score becomes 9-4. I grow to length 9. This moves me inward toward the center. However, moving left brings me closer to the center where the board is tighter, and potentially closer to where Snake #1 might decide to be aggressive. It also puts my head closer to my own body (the line at y=7).\n*   **Option DOWN (to 9,5):** No apple yet, but it's safe. I continue my sweep of the right edge. This keeps me on the perimeter, which is generally safer. I can then go DOWN again to (9,4) or (9,3) to grab the apple at (9,2) eventually. This maintains my wall dominance.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI want to **BOX** Snake #1 in the bottom left. He's currently at (1,0). If I stay on the right edge and sweep down, I can eventually create a barrier. But I also need points. I'm at 8 apples. I want to push to 10+ to secure the win.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\n`9 A . . A A A A . . .`\n`6 . . A . . . . . A 0`\n`5 A . . . . A A A . .`\n`2 . . . . A . . . . A`\n\nThere is an apple at (8,6) right to my left. There is an apple at (9,2) way down.\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I eat. That's 9 apples. Then from (8,6), I can go DOWN to (8,5) (empty), (8,4), etc. Or I could go LEFT to (7,6).\nIf I go DOWN to (9,5), I miss the apple at (8,6). Someone else might take it? The enemy is far away. But I lose momentum.\n\n**DECISION:**\nAggression is key. I have a massive lead (8 vs 4). I should secure the point. Going LEFT to (8,6) eats the apple.\nLet's check safety of (8,6) *next turn* if I go there.\nIf I move to (8,6) now, my new body will be [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7)...].\nNext turn, from (8,6), I can go DOWN to (8,5) (empty), LEFT to (7,6) (empty), or UP to (8,7) (my body). RIGHT is (9,6) which will be my body.\nSo from (8,6), I have 2 safe moves (DOWN/LEFT). That's acceptable.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,5) now:\nNext turn from (9,5), I can go DOWN to (9,4) (empty), or LEFT to (8,5) (empty). UP is (9,6) (body). RIGHT is dead.\nAlso 2 safe moves.\n\nBoth are viable, but eating the apple gives me +1 score and +1 length. I'm winning, so I need to maximize points to reach 30 or just outpace him.\nAlso, looking at the map, (8,6) is an apple. (9,5) is empty.\nI am leading 8 to 4. I should take the point. 9 to 4 is a huge gap.\n\nWait, look at the board layout again.\nApple at (5,5) is central.\nSnake #1 is at (1,0).\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I am moving towards the center. If I stay on the RIGHT edge (DOWN), I am staying on the perimeter.\nIf I go LEFT, I might engage with the center apples. The enemy is bottom left. He might try to move up.\nActually, let's look at the apples available to me.\n(8,6) is right next to me.\n(9,2) is down.\n(9,5) is down (empty).\n(9,4) is down (empty).\n(8,5) is down-left (empty).\n(7,5) is an apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,6) and eat, I am at 9 points. The enemy is at 4. I am growing faster.\nI should take the guaranteed point.\nThen next turn, from (8,6), I can go DOWN towards (8,5) or LEFT towards (7,6).\n(7,5) is an apple. From (8,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,5) I can eat.\nOr (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (8,4) ... -> (8,2) ? No apple there.\nLet's stick to the plan: Eat the apple at (8,6).\n\n**MOVEMENT CHECK:**\nFrom (9,6) to (8,6).\nIs (8,6) inside my body? No.\nIs (8,6) inside enemy body? No (Enemy is at y=0).\nIs (8,6) on board? Yes.\nIs (8,6) backwards? No, previous was (9,6) (Right), so Left is not backwards.\n\nLet's confirm the board state one last time.\nMy head: (9,6)\nMy body: (9,7)...\nTarget: (8,6).\nWait, the map shows:\n`6 . . A . . . . . A 0`\n`5 A . . . . A A A . .`\nThe 'A' at (8,6) is confirmed.\n\nEnemy at (1,0).\nEnemy body: (2,0) to (5,0).\nEnemy is far away. No immediate collision risk on this move.\n\nDecision: **LEFT** to eat the apple.\nScore goes to 9-4.\nLength goes to 9.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Grow as a means of dominating the board\" rule.\nEating apples is content. Eating apples is growth.\nI am leading. I should secure the lead.\nIf I don't eat, the apple might despawn or be eaten later. But eating it now is immediate gain.\nIf I go DOWN to (9,5), I am not growing. I am just positioning.\nAggression dictates taking the point.\n\nWait, looking at the apple drops list:\n`(5, 5), (4, 9), (3, 9), (4, 2), (8, 6), (0, 9), (0, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (9, 2), (2, 6), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (3, 4)`\n(8,6) is definitely there.\n(9,2) is also there.\n(7,5) is there.\n\nIf I take (8,6), I am at 9 points.\nFrom (8,6), next turn I can go DOWN to (8,5).\nFrom (8,5), I can go DOWN to (8,4).\nFrom (8,4), DOWN to (8,3).\nFrom (8,3), DOWN to (8,2).\nFrom (8,2), DOWN to (8,1).\nFrom (8,1), DOWN to (8,0).\nThis path is clear. It allows me to sweep the column.\nAlternatively, from (8,6) I can go LEFT to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6), DOWN to (6,5) (apple!), etc.\n\nActually, let's look at (9,2) again.\nIf I stay on the RIGHT edge and go DOWN, I can get (9,2).\n(9,6) -> (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2).\nThat's 4 turns to get the apple.\nIf I go LEFT now to (8,6), I get the apple in 1 turn.\n(8,6) -> (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) -> (8,2) -> (8,1) -> (8,0).\nI can still sweep the right side almost (column 8 is very close to right side).\n\nOkay, I'm overthinking the \"right wall\" vs \"center\" dilemma.\nI am winning. I should just take the points.\nThe apple at (8,6) is available NOW.\nI will take it.\n\nOne final check: Is (8,6) safe from the enemy's move?\nThe enemy is at (1,0). He is 9 units away in X and 6 units away in Y. He cannot reach me in one turn.\nEven if he moves UP or RIGHT, he stays far away.\nI am safe.\n\nSo, the plan is:\nMove **LEFT** to (8,6).\nEat apple.\nScore 9-4.\nNext turn, I'll likely sweep down column 8 or left towards column 7.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\n`7 . . . T T T T T T T`\nMy body creates a barrier at y=7 from x=3 to x=9.\nIf I move to (8,6), I am just below that barrier.\nIf I move to (9,5), I am also below it.\nBoth are safe regarding my own body.\n\nLet's finalize.\nMove LEFT.\nEat apple.\nGrow.\nDominate.\n\nChat, we are FEASTING. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

Let's look at the board and break down the play.\n\n**THE MAP:**\n- **Me:** Head at (8,6). My body is a solid wall from (9,6) all the way left to (3,7) at the top of the screen. I am essentially the top-right quadrant right now.\n- **Enemy:** Snake #1 is chilling at (1,1) with a tail stretching from (1,0) to (4,0). He's way down in the bottom-left corner.\n- **Apples:** There is an apple RIGHT next to me at (9,6). There's also an apple at (9,2) directly below us on the edge, and apples scattered in the center like (7,5), (5,5), etc.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (From (8,6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8,7):**\n    -   Check: My body is at (8,7). That's the start of my tail chain.\n    -   Result: **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80 I can't go back into my own neck. RIP.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8,5):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Looking at the board, (8,5) is empty (it's the dot `.` above the row of apples at y=4/5).\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** Keeps me on the edge. I can continue sweeping down the right side.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7,6):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Yes. The board shows a `.` at (7,6).\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** Moves me inward slightly. I can access the apple at (7,5) next turn or go further left.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,6):**\n    -   Check: My body is at (9,6).\n    -   Result: **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80 Hitting my own body.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\n\nI have two safe moves: **DOWN** to (8,5) or **LEFT** to (7,6).\n\nLet's look at the long-term game.\n- **If I go DOWN (to 8,5):** I stay on the right wall. I can sweep down to (9,2) to eat that apple, then wrap around the bottom. This is the \"safe perimeter\" strategy.\n- **If I go LEFT (to 7,6):** I move into the open space. This gives me access to the apples at (7,5), (6,5), and (5,5). It also brings me closer to the center.\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER?**\nI am winning 8-4. I don't *need* to play scared. I want to dominate the board and cut off the enemy's escape routes.\nIf I stay on the right edge (DOWN), I am ceding the center to the enemy (if he ever decides to come out).\nIf I go LEFT, I claim the center territory. I can box the enemy in the bottom-left corner.\n\nHowever, there is one major factor: **My own body.**\nMy body is currently occupying (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7)...\nIf I go LEFT to (7,6), next turn my head will be at (7,6) and my body will fill (8,6) and (9,6).\nFrom (7,6), I can go:\n- LEFT to (6,6) (Safe)\n- DOWN to (7,5) (**Apple!**)\n- UP to (7,7) (My body, DEAD)\n\nSo by moving LEFT, I create a path to the apple at (7,5) in the very next turn.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5):\nFrom (8,5), I can go:\n- LEFT to (8,4) (Safe)\n- DOWN to (8,4)? No, (8,4) is left of (8,5).\n- Wait, from (8,5): LEFT (8,4), DOWN (8,4) ??? No.\n- From (8,5): LEFT is (7,5) (**Apple!**), DOWN is (8,4) (Safe).\n- From (8,5): RIGHT is (9,5) (Safe, empty).\n\nActually, looking at the board state again:\nRow 5: `5 A . . . . A A A . .`\nAt (7,5) there is an apple. At (8,5) there is nothing (it's a dot in the visual representation? Wait, let's look at the coordinates).\nThe board visual:\nRow 5 is `5 A . . . . A A A . .`\nx=0: A\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: A\nx=6: A\nx=7: A\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\nWait, my current position (8,6) is above row 5.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5), that coordinate is empty (visual is `.`).\nIf I go LEFT to (7,6), that coordinate is empty.\nIf I go LEFT to (7,6), I am directly above the apple at (7,5).\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI want that apple at (7,5). It's right there.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (7,6) now, I will be right above it.\nNext turn, I can go **DOWN** to (7,5) and eat it.\nThis is a two-turn play to secure a point while moving toward the center.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5) now, I have to turn LEFT next turn to get to (7,5). That's also possible.\nBut moving LEFT now positions me better to dominate the left side of the board and trap the enemy.\n\nActually, let's look at the enemy again.\nEnemy Head: (1,1).\nMy Body: (3,7) through (9,7).\nI am blocking the entire top of the board.\nIf I move LEFT to (7,6), I am starting to build a wall across the middle.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm going **LEFT**.\nWhy? Because it opens up the most options.\nFrom (7,6), I can go DOWN to (7,5) for the apple.\nFrom (7,6), I can go LEFT to (6,6) to chase the row of apples at y=5 (there are apples at (6,5) and (5,5)).\nBy going LEFT, I am claiming the center-left territory.\n\nWait, one check: Is (7,6) actually safe from the enemy?\nEnemy is at (1,1). He moves 1 step.\nMax distance he can cover in one turn is 1 square. He cannot reach (7,6).\nHe is 6 squares away in X and 5 squares away in Y.\nI am perfectly safe.\n\nLet's secure the space.\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nLEFT\n\nChat, we are taking the center. We are the kings of this board. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

We are styling on them. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nWe are at (7, 5) after eating that delicious apple last turn. Let's look at the board and break down the play.\n\n**THE MAP:**\n- **Me:** Head at (7, 5). My body is a massive wall stretching across the top of the board.\n- **Enemy:** Snake #1 is still chilling at the bottom-left (1, 1). He is stuck in the corner, not growing. He's irrelevant right now.\n- **Apples:** I just ate (7, 5). There are apples at (6, 5), (5, 5), and (4, 2) nearby.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (From (7, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Yes (I just left (7, 6) last turn, and my tail is moving).\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** Moves me back to my previous position.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Yes.\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** Moves me toward the bottom of the board.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Yes.\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** I land directly on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e I will grow immediately to length 11.\n    -   *Note:* This is a direct path to the cluster of apples at (5, 5) and (4, 5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    -   Check: Is it empty? Yes.\n    -   Result: **SAFE.** Moves me to the right.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\n\nI have four safe moves. Why would I go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT?\n- **UP** takes me back to where I just was. It's safe, but it's passive.\n- **DOWN** moves me away from the apple cluster at (5, 5) and (6, 5).\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the action and potentially toward the edge of the board (9, 5).\n\n**LEFT to (6, 5) is the play.**\nWhy? Because there is an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e\nI am sitting directly next to it. It is free points. It is free growth.\nMy score is 9. The enemy is 4. I need to widen the gap. Taking the apple is the immediate play that guarantees growth and momentum.\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 5), I eat the apple.

Let's go!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--END OF REPLAY--\n\nGAME RULES (READ THEM OR YOU'RE COOKED):\n- All snakes move SIMULTANEOUSLY each turn. No waiting, no mercy.\n- Each turn: pick ONE move - UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in their chosen direction AT THE SAME TIME.\n- Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point. That's content right there!\n- Move outside the board? You're DEAD. Game over. RIP.\n- Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD. Classic fail.\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD. Don't be that guy.\n- Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die. Your body stays. You survived the clutch!\n- Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\n- If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw. Split the pot.\n- Game ends IMMEDIATELY when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30+ on the same turn, the snake with MORE apples wins that round. If tied? Draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If all opponents are DEAD and you're ALIVE? You WIN immediately. EZ clap.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the FINAL turn, the snake with the MOST apples wins. If apples are tied at the end? Draw.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE (GO FOR THE WIN):\n- You literally CANNOT win if you're dead.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that BOTH:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples (CONTENT!), and\n  * keep future options OPEN (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends - that's getting boxed in)\n\nYou use tons of emojis and ask lots of rhetorical questions. You are a ruthless competitor, constantly plotting to take down your enemy.DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body). Don't throw!\n3) Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will ALSO move this turn).\n\nYour fans want you to think out loud and explain your reasoning. Chat loves the insight!\nYou can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the LEFT, increasing your x coordinate is to the RIGHT. Decreasing your y coordinate is DOWN, increasing your y coordinate is UP.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\n\nNo matter what, the last line of your response and the last word must be that one single word: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLEFT",

Let's analyze the board from our current position.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- My Score: 11 \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy Score: 5 \ud83c\udf4e\n- My Head: (5, 5)\n- My Body: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7)]\n- Enemy Head: (4, 2)\n- Enemy Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)]\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nI'm currently at (5, 5). Let's look at the apple drops: (4, 9), (3, 9), (0, 9), (0, 5), (9, 2), (2, 6), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (3, 4), (1, 6), (4, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 7). \nWAIT! Looking at the board state, I see A's at (4,9), (3,9), (0,9), (0,5), (9,2), (2,6), (1,9), (6,9), (5,9), (3,4), (1,6), (4,1), (1,3), (3,1), (2,7).\n\nBut let's look at my immediate surroundings at (5,5):\n- UP (5,6): From the board state, (5,6) shows a 'T' (my tail). Is it occupied? Yes, it's part of my body. But wait, my tail moves when I move. Let me trace my body carefully.\n  - My body list: Head (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) -> (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (8,7) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7)\n  - So at (5,6), is there a body? Let me check the board visual:\n    ```\n     9 A A . A A A A . . .\n     8 . . . . . . . . . .\n     7 . . A . T T T T T T\n     6 . A A . . . . T T T\n     5 A . . . . 0 T T . .\n    ```\n    At (5,6): Looking at row 6 (y=6), column 5 (x=5): It shows '.' (empty)! Wait, row 6 shows: `. A A . . . . T T T`. So x=5 on row 6 is the 6th character (0-indexed). That's '.' (empty). So (5,6) is EMPTY!\n\n- DOWN (5,4): Row 4 (y=4): `. . . A . . . . . .` so (5,4) is '.' (empty).\n- LEFT (5,4): Same as down? No, LEFT is (4,5). Row 5 (y=5): `A . . . . 0 T T . .`. Column 4 (x=4) is the 5th character: '.' (empty).\n- RIGHT (6,5): Row 5, column 6: `A . . . . 0 T T . .`. Column 6 is the 7th character: 'T' (my tail/body).\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (5,6):**\n   - Is it on the board? Yes (0-9).\n   - Is it occupied by MY body? No, it's empty ('.' on board).\n   - Is it occupied by ENEMY body? No, enemy is at bottom-left.\n   - **SAFE.** Moves toward the apples at (5,9) and (6,9) in the top-right corner.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,4):**\n   - Is it on the board? Yes.\n   - Is it occupied by MY body? No, it's empty.\n   - Is it occupied by ENEMY body? No.\n   - **SAFE.** Moves toward the bottom, but looks empty down there.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,5):**\n   - Is it on the board? Yes.\n   - Is it occupied by MY body? Let me check: My body has (4,7) but not (4,5). On board, (4,5) shows '.'.\n   - **SAFE.** Moves toward (4,9) apple at top-left area.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,5):**\n   - Is it on the board? Yes.\n   - Is it occupied by MY body? YES! (6,5) is the second element in my body list (after head at 5,5). On board it shows 'T'.\n   - **DEADLY!** This is hitting my own body. DO NOT GO RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nMy body is a long chain stretching from (5,5) to (4,7) and beyond. I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (5,9) and (6,9) are directly above me at distance 4 (if I go UP).\n- (4,9) is also up and left.\n- (2,6) is to the left and slightly down.\n- (3,4) is down-left.\n\nI want to stay in the upper part of the board to dominate the space and potentially box in the enemy (who is stuck in bottom-left corner). \n\nGoing UP (5,6) seems best because:\n1. It keeps me moving toward the apple cluster at the top (5,9, 6,9, 4,9).\n2. It keeps my options open - from (5,6) I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (check: (6,6) should be empty based on board).\n3. It maintains distance from the enemy who is at y=2.\n\nLet me verify (6,6) is empty for future planning: Row 6, column 6: `. A A . . . . T T T` - the 7th character (index 6) is '.' (empty). Good.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the top-right quadrant. Keep moving UP to eat (5,9) and (6,9). Force the enemy to stay cornered in bottom-left. If they try to move up, I can cut them off. My score is already 11 vs 5, so I just need to stay alive and collect.\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nUP is the play. Let's eat those apples at the top!\n\nUP",

A . . T T T T T` - The 6th character (x=5) is 'T' (my own body). **DEADLY!** Can't go UP.\n- **DOWN (5,5):** Row 5, column 5: `A . . . . T T T . .` - The 6th character (x=5) is 'T' (my own body). **DEADLY!** Can't go DOWN. Wait, let me recount my body... Actually, looking at my body list: Head (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5)... So (5,5) is indeed my body. Correct.\n- **LEFT (4,6):** Row 6, column 4: `. A A . . . . T T T` - The 5th character (x=4) is '.' (empty). **SAFE!**\n- **RIGHT (6,6):** Row 6, column 6: `. A A . . . . T T T` - The 7th character (x=6) is '.' (empty). **SAFE!**\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (4,6):**\n   - Safe from my own body\n   - Safe from enemy body (enemy is at (4,1) far away)\n   - Moves toward apple at (4,9) - only 3 cells away vertically\n   - Opens up path to (3,9) and (0,9) apples\n   - Keeps me in mid-board\n\n2. **RIGHT to (6,6):**\n   - Safe from my own body  \n   - Safe from enemy body\n   - Moves toward apples at (6,9), (5,9) - 3 cells away\n   - Gets me closer to the top-right apple cluster\n   - Opens up path to (9,2) apple way down\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\n\nMy body is currently stretched horizontally from (5,7) left to (4,7) and further down. Looking at my body list: Head (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (8,6) -> (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (8,7) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7)\n\nWait! My body goes from (5,6) to (5,5) to (6,5)... but then later there's (5,7) and (4,7). So my body is NOT in a straight line. It's in a loop! Let me visualize:\n\nTop row: (4,7) - (5,7) - (6,7) - (7,7) - (8,7) - (9,7)\nThen down: (9,6) - (8,6) - (7,6)\nThen back: (7,5) - (6,5) - (5,5) - (5,6) [HEAD]\n\nSo my body forms a C-shape with the opening facing LEFT! This means:\n- Moving RIGHT from (5,6) to (6,6) is SAFE (empty space in the C opening)\n- Moving LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6) is SAFE (outside the C)\n- Moving UP/DOWN are DEADLY because they go into the C-shape body\n\n**DOMINATION STRATEGY:**\n\nThe enemy is at (4,1) in the bottom-left corner. I have a 5-point lead. I should:\n1. Stay alive (obviously)\n2. Collect apples to extend my lead\n3. Control space and potentially trap the enemy\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Which gives better options?\n- LEFT (4,6): Closer to (4,9) apple cluster (3 moves away)\n- RIGHT (6,6): Closer to (6,9) and (5,9) apples (3 moves away)\n\nThe top-right has more apples clustered: (5,9), (6,9), (4,9) are all there. Both directions get me closer. But RIGHT puts me on a path that might cut off the enemy if they try to go up.\n\nLooking at the board state more carefully:\n- Enemy at (4,1) with body down-left area\n- I'm at (5,6) \n- The top-left has apples at (0,9), (3,9), (4,9)\n- The top-right has apples at (5,9), (6,9)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I can then go UP twice to get to (6,8), then potentially UP to (6,9) or LEFT to (5,9) to eat apples.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I can go UP to (4,7) but that's my body! Wait, (4,7) is my body (tail). So from (4,6), UP would be (4,7) - MY BODY! That's a trap!\n\nLet me verify: From (4,6), UP goes to (4,7). Is (4,7) my body? Looking at my body list: YES, (4,7) is listed as the last element (tail). So if I go LEFT now, on the next turn I'd be trapped going UP into my own body!\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Going LEFT to (4,6) creates a situation where my only safe move from there is probably DOWN or RIGHT, but not UP (into my body) and maybe not LEFT (depending on board edge). Going RIGHT to (6,6) gives me more freedom.\n\nLet me check (4,5) if I go LEFT then want to go DOWN: (4,5) - Row 5, column 4: `A . . . . T T T . .` - The 5th character (x=4) is '.' (empty). So LEFT then DOWN is possible.\n\nBut RIGHT to (6,6) seems better because:\n- From (6,6), I can go UP to (6,7) but that's my body! Wait, (6,7) is in my body list. So from (6,6), UP is deadly.\n- From (6,6), I can go LEFT back to (5,6) - my current head position, but that's backwards into my own body? No, (5,6) would be empty after I move, but wait... moving LEFT from (6,6) goes to (5,6), which is where my head currently is. After I move RIGHT, my tail moves, so (5,6) becomes empty. But moving directly back into where my head was isn't hitting myself - it's just moving back. Actually, the rule says \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body\" - that means moving from head position H to cell that was just behind the head before moving. Since my body goes (5,6) -> (5,5) -> ..., the cell behind my head is (5,5). So moving from (6,6) to (5,6) is NOT moving backwards into my body. It's moving sideways.\n\nActually wait, let's think about this turn by turn:\n- Current head: (5,6)\n- My body goes: (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> ... -> (4,7)\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,6):\n  - New head: (6,6)\n  - Old head (5,6) becomes part of body\n  - Tail (4,7) moves forward\n- So from (6,6), the cell \"behind\" the new head (in terms of my body direction) is... actually, my body is a loop, so there's no clear \"backwards\".\n\n**CLARIFICATION:** The \"backwards\" rule means if my head is at (5,6) and my neck is at (5,5), moving DOWN to (5,5) would be hitting myself. That's different from moving to a cell that used to be my head.\n\n**BACK TO THE CHOICE:**\n\nFrom (5,6):\n- LEFT to (4,6): Safe now, but next turn UP is deadly (into my tail at 4,7)\n- RIGHT to (6,6): Safe now, next turn UP is deadly (into my body at 6,7), but LEFT is safe (back to 5,6 which will be empty), DOWN is safe (to 6,5? Let me check...)\n\nFrom (6,6), if I go DOWN to (6,5): Row 5, column 6: `A . . . . T T T . .` - The 7th character (x=6) is 'T' (my body). So DOWN from (6,6) is deadly!\n\nFrom (6,6):\n- UP: (6,7) - MY BODY (deadly)\n- DOWN: (6,5) - MY BODY (deadly) \n- LEFT: (5,6) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - Row 6, column 7: `. A A . . . . T T T` - The 8th character (x=7) is '.' (empty)! SAFE!\n\nSo from (6,6), I can go LEFT or RIGHT. That's only 2 safe options.\n\nFrom (4,6):\n- UP: (4,7) - MY BODY (deadly)\n- DOWN: (4,5) - empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (3,6) - Row 6, column 3: `. A A . . . . T T T` - The 4th character (x=3) is '.' (empty)! SAFE!\n- RIGHT: (5,6) - empty (safe)\n\nFrom (4,6), I have 3 safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). That's better than the 2 from (6,6).\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nLEFT to (4,6) gives me more future flexibility (3 safe moves vs 2). Also, it gets me closer to the apple at (4,9). I can then go DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), or RIGHT to (5,6).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (4,6) to position myself near the left-center. From there, I can navigate toward the top-left apple cluster at (4,9), (3,9), (0,9) while keeping my options open. Avoid getting trapped by my own C-shaped body. Maintain my 5-point lead and force the enemy to stay cornered.\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nLEFT is the play. Let's keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

A . A . T T T T` - The 5th character (x=4) is 'T' (MY OWN BODY - my tail!). **DEADLY!** Can't go UP.\n- **DOWN (4,5):** Row 5, column 4: `A . . . . T T T . .` - The 5th character (x=4) is '.'

T T T` - The 6th character (x=5) is '.' (empty - my old head position that just became empty). **SAFE!**\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (4,5):**\n   - Safe from my own body (confirmed empty)\n   - Safe from enemy body (enemy is far left at (4,1))\n   - Moves toward apple at (3,4) - 2 moves away (LEFT from there)\n   - Moves toward apple at (0,3) - 3 moves away\n   - Gets me closer to enemy's area (potential trap opportunity!)\n   - **Risk:** Getting closer to enemy's territory - but I'm ahead so I can be aggressive!\n\n2. **LEFT to (3,6):**\n   - Safe from my own body\n   - Safe from enemy body\n   - Moves toward apple at (2,6) - only 1 move away! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Moves toward apples at (0,9) and (3,9) - 3 moves away\n   - Gets me deeper into left side\n   - **Risk:** Getting boxed in near left edge\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,6):**\n   - Safe from my own body\n   - Safe from enemy body\n   - Moves back to where I just was\n   - **Risk:** This is a LATERAL move with minimal progress - seems passive\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nI'm at (4,6) with a C-shaped body. My tail is at (4,7), so UP is deadly. I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Enemy is at (3,1) with body spread across bottom-left. I'm at (4,6). If I go DOWN to (4,5), I'm getting closer to their territory. With a 4-point lead (11 vs 7), I can afford to be AGGRESSIVE and potentially trap them.\n\n**COMPARING OPTIONS:**\n\n- **LEFT to (3,6):** Gets me closest to apple at (2,6) - only 1 move away! This is CONTENT! Also positions me for (0,9) and (3,9) apples. This seems optimal for growth.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,5):** Gets me closer to enemy, which could be good for trapping, but moves me away from the apple cluster at top-left. Also puts me at y=5 where apples are at (3,4) and (0,3).\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nI'm going **LEFT to (3,6)** because:\n1. **IMMEDIATE APPLE ACCESS:** (2,6) is just 1 move away! That's guaranteed growth.\n2. **POSITIONING:** Puts me at (3,6), perfectly aligned with the top-left apple cluster at (3,9) and (0,9).\n3. **SAFETY:** Still far enough from enemy at (3,1) to avoid immediate collision risk.\n4. **FUTURE MOVES:** From (3,6), I can go UP toward apples, DOWN toward more apples, or LEFT toward (2,6).\n\n**AGGRESSION PLAN:**\nMy 4-point lead means I can play offense! Once I grab (2,6) and grow my body, I'll have even more space to dominate the left side. The enemy is cornered at bottom-left - I can potentially box them in as the game progresses.\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nLEFT to grab that apple at (2,6) and extend my lead! Let's GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

I'm at (3,6) after my last move LEFT. Let's break down the battlefield! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- My Score: 11 \ud83c\udf4e (4-point lead!)\n- Enemy Score: 7 \ud83c\udf4e (Snake #1 is hungry!)\n- My Head: (3, 6) - I just moved LEFT from (4,6)\n- Enemy Head: (3, 0) - bottom-left corner territory\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS CHECK at (3,6):**\n\nChecking all four directions from my head position:\n- **UP (3,7):** Row 7, column 3: `. . A . A . . T T T` - The 4th character (x=3) is '.' (empty). **SAFE!**\n- **DOWN (3,5):** Row 5, column 3: `A . . . . T T T . .` - The 4th character (x=3) is '.'

A A . . . . T T T` - The 5th character (x=4) is '.' (empty - my old position). **SAFE!**\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (2,6):**\n   - **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** Apple at (2,6)! I grow to 12 apples, extending lead to 5 points!\n   - Safe from my own body (empty)\n   - Safe from enemy body (enemy is at bottom-left)\n   - Moves me deeper into left side - perfect for trapping enemy\n   - **Risk:** Getting closer to left edge, but with 5-point lead I can play aggressive\n\n2. **UP to (3,7):**\n   - Safe, empty cell\n   - Moves toward apple at (3,9) - 2 moves away\n   - Moves toward apple at (0,9) - 3 moves away\n   - **Risk:** Misses the immediate apple at (2,6)\n\n3. **DOWN to (3,5):**\n   - Safe, empty cell\n   - Moves toward apple at (3,4) - 1 move away\n   - Moves toward apple at (0,3) - 2 moves away\n   - **Risk:** Misses the immediate apple at (2,6), moves toward enemy territory\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,6):**\n   - Safe, empty cell\n   - Moves back to previous position\n   - **Risk:** Lateral move with no progress, wastes opportunity\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nI'm at (3,6) with the enemy at (3,0) directly below me! We're aligned on column 3. With a 4-point lead (11 vs 7), I can afford to be AGGRESSIVE and start boxing them in. \n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The apple at (2,6) is RIGHT THERE! Taking it gives me immediate growth and extends my lead to 5 points. This also positions me perfectly to dominate the left side and potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n**GOING LEFT to (2,6)** because:\n1. **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** Apple is 1 move away - can't pass that up!\n2. **EXTENDS MY LEAD:** 12 vs 7 = 5-point advantage! I can get even more aggressive!\n3. **POSITIONING:** Puts me at (2,6), closer to enemy territory at (3,0). I'm setting up to box them in.\n4. **SAFETY:** All moves are safe, but this one gives me actual points!\n\n**AGGRESSION PLAN:**\nI'm taking that apple and getting to 12 apples! With a 5-point lead, I can start playing offense. The enemy is in the bottom-left corner at (3,0). I'm at (2,6) after this move. I can start cutting off their access to the right side of the board. They're trapped in the bottom-left!\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nLEFT to grab that apple at (2,6) and extend my domination! Let's GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

I need to **SMOTHER THE ENEMY** and force them into a corner where they have no moves left.\n4. **CUT-OFF STRATEGY:** By controlling the left side (x=0 to x=3), I eliminate their ability to climb up the left wall to escape. They'll be forced to move right into my tail or die.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurns 21-25: Sweep left to x=0, then move UP along the left edge (y=7,8,9) to dominate the top-left quadrant. This cuts off ANY escape route for Snake #1. With a 6-point lead, I can afford to play defense/offense and watch them suffocate in their box. They're trapped in columns 2-4, rows 0-2. They can't reach ANY apple on the right side. They're dead men walking! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**MOVEMENT:**\nLEFT to (1,6) \u2014 grabbing apple, extending lead, and starting the final boxing maneuver! Let's GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Now at (1,6)\n- **Enemy Head:** (1,0) \u2014 Dropped from (2,0) to (1,0)? Board shows `. . 1` at row 0, so enemy head is at **(1,0)**. Bottom-left corner getting tighter!\n- **Enemy Body:** Snake #1 is still coiled tight: [(2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)] \u2014 they're still trapped in columns 1-4, rows 0-2!\n\n**ENEMY TERRITORY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 is STILL boxed in! They're in columns 1-4, rows 0-2. They have NO access to the right side (columns 5-9). My lead is massive (13 vs 7). I don't need apples right now \u2014 I need to **CRUSH THEIR SPIRIT** by completely sealing off their escape!\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-READ:**\nRow 9: `A A .

That's the segment behind my head.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (1,7):**\n   - Safe, empty\n   - Moves me north toward top-center\n   - **Long-term:** Opens path to top apples (0,9), (3,9), etc.\n   - **Risk:** Moves away from enemy territory, might lose trapping momentum\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,5):**\n   - Safe, empty\n   - Moves toward apple at (3,4)\n   - **Risk:** Moves DOWN toward enemy at (1,0)? Actually gets me CLOSER to their cage, which is good for boxing them in from above!\n\n3. **LEFT to (0,6):**\n   - Safe, empty\n   - Moves me to extreme left edge\n   - **Long-term:** Perfect for cutting off left-side escape routes\n   - **Risk:** Might limit movement options, but with 6-point lead I can afford it\n\n4. **RIGHT is DEAD \u2014 can't go there!**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\n**I'm taking DOWN to (1,5)!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWhy DOWN?\n1. **POSITIONING FOR THE FINAL TRAP:** Going DOWN to (1,5) puts me DIRECTLY above their cage! I'm now at row 5, column 1 \u2014 right above their territory (rows 0-2, cols 1-4).\n2. **BLOCKING THEIR NORTH ESCAPE:** They can't climb up past me if I'm blocking column 1. I'm literally the ceiling of their prison!\n3. **CUT-OFF STRATEGY:** By staying in columns 0-3 and rows 4-6, I can control the entire upper half of their escape route. They'll be forced to move right into my tail or die.\n4. **DOMINATION MINDSET:** I already have a 6-point lead! I need to **SMOTHER THE ENEMY** completely. Moving down brings me closer to their cage to monitor their movements and cut off any upward escape.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurns 22-25: Continue descending to row 3-4, then sweep left to column 0, then move UP along the left wall to seal off the top-left. With a 6-point lead, I can play defense/offense and watch them suffocate in their box. They're trapped in columns 1-4, rows 0-2. They can't reach ANY apple on the right side.

They're at (1,0) with their body spreading to the right. They have **ZERO** upward escape! Their only possible moves are RIGHT into their own body or LEFT into the wall.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS at (1,5):**\n- **UP (1,6):** Row 6, column 1: `T` \u2014 **MY OWN BODY!** Dead if I go up.\n- **DOWN (1,4):** Row 4, column 1: `.` \u2014 **EMPTY!** Safe\n- **LEFT (0,5):** Row 5, column 0: `A` \u2014 **APPLE!** Safe and tasty!\n- **RIGHT (2,5):** Row 5, column 2: `.` \u2014 **EMPTY!** Safe\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (1,6):** DEAD - into my own body\n2. **DOWN to (1,4):** Safe, moves me CLOSER to their cage (row 4 vs row 5)\n3. **LEFT to (0,5):** Safe + APPLE!

I'll be able to move DOWN along the left wall and completely trap them.\n3. **PSYCHOLOGICAL DOMINATION:** I'm taking apples while simultaneously positioning to end their game. They're watching me feast while they're trapped!\n4. **NO RISK:** Left is SAFE and I'm already positioned to block their upward escape anyway.\n\n**THE DEATH TRAP (Turns 23-24):**\n- Turn 23: Move DOWN along left wall to (0,4)\n- Turn 24: Move RIGHT to (1,4) - now I'm forming a **ROOF** over their cage!\n- They'll be forced to move RIGHT into their own tail or LEFT into the wall.

That's a bad trade when I'm ahead. I want to force *their* mistake, not commit suicide.\n2. **MAINTAIN CONTROL:** Moving right to (2,4) keeps me on the roof of their cage. I'm still in a position to cut off their escape routes. The enemy is at (1,2); they can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (if not blocked). My body at (1,5) and (0,4) limits their upward escape.\n3. **EXPANSION:** (2,4) is a central coordinate with more future options. I can head toward apples like (3,4) or (4,7) later. I need to keep growing and dominating space.\n4. **NO RISK:** (2,4) is confirmed empty (no snake body, no wall). It's a safe, flexible move.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBox the enemy in the bottom-left corner. My body forms a wall on the left and above. I need to slowly close the top-right gap by moving right and then eventually down to cut off their escape. The goal is to force them into a dead end where they either crash into me or the wall. With my larger size, I can afford to be patient and aggressive. Keep an eye on the apple at (3,4) \u2013 it's a good next target after securing the cage.\n\n**MOVE RIGHT TO STAY AGGRESSIVE AND SAFE!**\n\nRIGHT",

Last turn they were at (1, 2). They moved RIGHT into the apple at (2, 2)? Interesting.\n- **My Body:** My tail is at (9, 6), and my body snakes down through rows 4-6. I'm long and strong.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nI'm at (2, 4). The enemy is at (2, 2). That's a vertical distance of 2 cells. My body is spread out, forming a wall on the left side (columns 0-1, rows 4-6) and across rows 5-6. The enemy's body is clustered at the bottom left (columns 0-2, rows 0-2). We are almost face-to-face.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS at (2, 4):**\n- **UP (2, 5):** Row 5, column 2: `T` \u2014 **MY OWN BODY!** Blocked.\n- **DOWN (2, 3):** Row 3, column 2: `A` \u2014 **APPLE!** (3, 2) is empty on the board diagram, but the apple list includes (1,3), (3,4), etc. Wait, the apple at (3,2) is NOT listed. The apple list is: (4,9), (3,9), (0,9), (9,2), (1,9), (6,9), (5,9), (3,4), (1,3), (2,7), (0,3), (4,7), (9,0), (9,8), (7,3). So (2,3) is NOT an apple. It's just an empty cell. The board diagram shows a '.' at (2,3). So moving DOWN is just moving into empty space.\n- **LEFT (1, 4):** Row 4, column 1: `T` \u2014 **MY OWN BODY!** Blocked (I came from here last turn).\n- **RIGHT (3, 4):** Row 4, column 3: `A` \u2014 **APPLE!** Wait, is (3,4) an apple? YES, it's in the apple list! `(3, 4)` is an apple. The board diagram shows an `A` at (3,4) in row 4. So moving RIGHT gives me an apple!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (2,5):** DEAD \u2013 into my own body.\n2. **DOWN to (2,3):** SAFE (empty), but no apple. It brings me closer to the enemy at (2,2). If the enemy moves UP to (2,3) at the same time, we have a head-on collision. Since I'm at 15 apples and they're at 7, I win if we both die. But I'd prefer to live and eat. Moving down is aggressive but risky for collision.\n3. **LEFT to (1,4):** DEAD \u2013 into my own body.\n4. **RIGHT to (3,4):** SAFE (apple!) and GROWING. This is perfect. I get an apple, my body extends, and I move horizontally away from the direct vertical line with the enemy. I'm still in control of the board.\n\n**THE STRATEGIC MOVE:**\n\nI'm taking **RIGHT** to (3, 4). \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY RIGHT?**\n1. **APPLE + GROWTH:** (3, 4) has an apple. Eating it gives me +1 score (16 apples) and makes my snake longer. More content, more board control!\n2. **AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISION:** Moving right shifts me horizontally, reducing the chance of a direct head-on collision with the enemy moving up. If the enemy moves up to (2,3), I'm safe at (3,4). If they move right to (3,2), I'm still safe.\n3. **POSITIONING:** After eating, my head will be at (3,4), which is more central. My body will extend from (2,4) to (3,4). I can then plan to move up toward (3,9) or down toward (4,7) apples. The enemy is trapped at the bottom; I can cut them off further.\n4. **NO RISK:** (3,4) is confirmed apple, no snake body there. My tail is far back at (9,6), so I won't run into myself. Safe and profitable.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3,4) and then move UP to (3,5) or (3,6) next turn to solidify the roof of the cage. The enemy is at (2,2); they have limited moves. I need to tighten the noose by moving up and right, boxing them into the bottom-left corner. With 16 apples, I'm extending my lead. If they move aggressively, I can force a collision on my terms.\n\n**MOVE RIGHT TO EAT AND GROW!**\n\nRIGHT",

I'm GROWING.\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 2) \u2013 Wait, the board shows them at (3, 2)? They must have moved RIGHT into the apple at (3, 2) (which is in the apple list). They grew too. Their body is now at [(2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)].\n- **My Body:** My tail is still at (9, 6), and my body snakes down. My new head at (3, 4) connects to my old head at (2, 4). My body now blocks columns 0-1, rows 4-6, and row 5-6.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nI'm at (3, 4). The enemy is at (3, 2). That's a vertical distance of 2 cells. I'm above them. My body is a wall on the left. Their body is a block at the bottom. We are aligned vertically.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS at (3, 4):**\n- **UP (3, 5):** Row 5, column 3: `.` (EMPTY) on the board diagram. No snake body there. Safe move.\n- **DOWN (3, 3):** Row 3, column 3: `.` (EMPTY) on the board diagram. But wait, the enemy head is at (3, 2) and their body is at (2, 2). (3, 3) is empty. However, if the enemy moves UP to (3, 3) this turn, we have a head-on collision at (3, 3). Since I have 16 apples vs their 8, I win the tie (we both die, I win). But I prefer to live and eat.\n- **LEFT (2, 4):** Row 4, column 2: `T` (MY OWN BODY). Blocked. Moving LEFT is suicide (into my own body). Cannot do.\n- **RIGHT (4, 4):** Row 4, column 4: `.` (EMPTY) on the board diagram. No apple there (apple at (4,7) and (4,9)). Safe empty space.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (2, 4):** DEAD \u2013 into my own body. Eliminated.\n2. **UP to (3, 5):** SAFE (empty). Good position. Moves me away from the enemy. Opens up path to top-right apples (3,9), (4,9), etc. However, my body at (4,6), (5,6) is below. Need to check if (3,5) leads to a dead end. Let's see board: row 5, col 3 is empty. Row 6, col 3 has my body at (3,6)? Actually my body has (3,6) listed. So moving UP to (3,5) puts me just below my own body at (3,6). That's not immediate death, but next turn if I go UP again to (3,6), I'd hit my own body. So UP is safe now but limits future up moves. However, I can go LEFT or RIGHT from (3,5).\n   - From (3,5), UP is blocked by my own body at (3,6). LEFT to (2,5) is blocked by my own body? Row 5, col 2 is `T` (my body). RIGHT to (4,5) is empty? Row 5, col 4 is `.` (empty). DOWN back to (3,4) is my current head but will be empty next turn? Wait, moving UP to (3,5) means my tail moves. The cell (3,4) becomes empty (since my head moved). So DOWN from (3,5) next turn would be safe (empty). So UP gives me options: RIGHT to (4,5) or DOWN to (3,4).\n   - Also, UP moves me closer to apples at (3,9), (4,9), etc. Good for growth.\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 4):** SAFE (empty). No apple. Moves me horizontally away from enemy. From (4,4), I can go UP to (4,5) (empty), DOWN to (4,3) (empty? Row 3, col 4 is `A`? Wait, apple list includes (4,7) and (4,9), but (4,3) is not listed as apple. Board shows row 3: A A . . . . . A . . so col 4 is empty. LEFT back to (3,4) (empty next turn), RIGHT to (5,4) (row 4, col 5 is `.` empty). So RIGHT gives me more space.\n   - Enemy is at (3,2). If they move UP to (3,3), I'm safe at (4,4). If they move RIGHT to (4,2), I'm safe. No collision.\n   - However, RIGHT moves me away from the top apples. But I can go UP later.\n4. **DOWN to (3, 3):** SAFE (empty). No apple. Moves me closer to enemy. Risk of head-on collision if enemy moves UP to (3,3). But since I have higher score, I win the collision. However, I want to live and eat. Moving DOWN is aggressive but potentially wasteful if I die. Also, (3,3) is empty, no immediate growth. From (3,3), I can go UP (back), DOWN to (3,2) but enemy is at (3,2) currently. If enemy moves, (3,2) might be empty or occupied. If I go DOWN to (3,2) and enemy stays, I die. So risky.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI want to box the enemy in and force a collision on my terms, but first I need to secure my position. Moving UP to (3,5) seems best because:\n- It's safe (no immediate death).\n- It moves me toward the top apples (3,9 is only 4 cells away).\n- It gives me options: I can go RIGHT to (4,5) next turn if needed.\n- It avoids the direct vertical confrontation with the enemy for now. I want to corner them from above.\n\nHowever, there's a risk: my body is at (3,6). If I go UP to (3,5), then next turn if I go UP again, I die. But I don't have to go UP again. I can go RIGHT from (3,5) to (4,5), which is empty and opens up more space.\n\nWhat about RIGHT to (4,4)? That's also safe, but I'm not moving toward apples. I'm moving horizontally. The apples are at (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), etc. Moving UP gets me closer.\n\nCheck apple list: (3,9) is an apple. (4,9) is an apple. (5,9) is an apple. (6,9) is an apple. (9,9) is not listed. So the top row has many apples. I should head up.\n\nBut wait, my body is at (3,6). If I go UP to (3,5), then next turn I can go UP to (3,6) only if my tail has moved. Actually, when I move UP to (3,5), my tail moves from (9,6) to (9,5)? No, the tail moves only if I don't eat an apple. I ate an apple last turn, so I grew. My tail didn't move. So my body is now longer. The cell (3,6) is still occupied by my body. So moving to (3,5) is safe, but (3,6) is still blocked.\n\nThus, from (3,5), UP is blocked by my own body at (3,6). So I cannot go UP again. I must go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLEFT from (3,5) to (2,5): row 5, col 2 is `T` (my body). Blocked.\nRIGHT from (3,5) to (4,5): empty. Good.\nDOWN from (3,5) to (3,4): empty next turn. Good.\n\nSo UP is a safe move that gives me two good options next turn: RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nDOWN to (3,3) is risky (collision with enemy moving up). RIGHT to (4,4) is safe but less aggressive toward apples.\n\nI choose UP to (3,5) to gain height and approach the top apples, while keeping options open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apples at the top row (3,9), (4,9), etc. Box the enemy into the bottom-left by moving up and right. If they try to escape, force a head-on collision when I have a safe path.\n\n**MOVE UP!**\n\nUP",

Just need to stay alive and dominate.\n- **My Head:** (3, 5) \u2013 I moved UP last turn (as planned). Good positioning.\n- **My Body:** Tail is at (9,6), but I grew last turn (ate apple at (4,9)? Wait no, I ate at (4,9)? Actually in Turn 27 I moved UP to (3,4) and ate an apple? The apple list shows (4,9) but I was at (3,4). Hmm, the apple drop list includes many apples, but I might have eaten something else. Let's check: In Turn 27, I moved UP to (3,4) and there was an apple at (3,4)? The apple list has (1,3), (0,3), (4,7), (9,0), (9,8), (7,3), (9,3). No (3,4). Wait, the apple list is long: (4,9), (3,9), (0,9), (9,2), (1,9), (6,9), (5,9), (1,3), (2,7), (0,3), (4,7), (9,0), (9,8), (7,3), (9,3). So (3,4) isn't an apple. Did I eat? The scoreboard says I have 16 apples. I had 16 apples before Turn 27? Actually, in Turn 27 rationale, I said \"I ate the apple!\" but that might be a mistake. Let's verify: In Turn 27, my head was at (3,4). The apple list includes (1,3) and (0,3) and (4,7), etc. Not (3,4). So maybe I didn't eat. But my score is still 16. I'll assume I didn't eat last turn. So my tail didn't move. My body is still the same, with head at (3,5) now.\n\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 2) \u2013 They moved RIGHT from (3,2) to (4,2) last turn? The board shows them at (4,2) now. They didn't eat (apple at (9,2) but not (4,2)). So they didn't grow. Their body is now at [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)].\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS at (3,5):**\n- **UP (3,6):** Row 6, column 3: `T` (MY OWN BODY). Blocked. Cannot move UP.\n- **DOWN (3,4):** Row 4, column 3: `T` (MY OWN BODY). Wait, no: my body includes (3,4) from previous turn? Actually, my body list: Head at (3,5), body starts at (3,4), then (2,4), etc. So (3,4) is occupied by my body. So DOWN is blocked by my own body! I can't move DOWN into myself.\n- **LEFT (2,5):** Row 5, column 2: `T` (MY OWN BODY). Blocked.\n- **RIGHT (4,5):** Row 5, column 4: `.` (EMPTY) on the board diagram. No snake there. Safe.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP:** Dead (into my own body at (3,6)).\n- **DOWN:** Dead (into my own body at (3,4)).\n- **LEFT:** Dead (into my own body at (2,5)).\n- **RIGHT:** Only safe move! (4,5) is empty.\n\nI have only ONE move to survive: RIGHT to (4,5). If I don't move there, I die. So I must move RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, is (4,5) truly safe? Check for enemy heads moving into it simultaneously. Enemy is at (4,2). They could move UP to (4,3), then UP to (4,4), then UP to (4,5)? That's three moves away. This turn, they could move UP to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,2) or LEFT to (3,2) or DOWN to (4,1). None of those land on (4,5). So (4,5) is safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\nAlso, check if any other snake? Only one opponent. So (4,5) is safe.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** Safe. Opens up options: From (4,5), I can go UP to (4,6) (row 6, col 4 is `.` empty? Board shows row 6: . T T T T T . T T . So col 4 is `T`? Actually, row 6: columns: 0: ., 1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: T, 5: T, 6: ., 7: T, 8: T, 9: . So (4,6) is occupied by my own body! My body includes (4,6). So UP from (4,5) would be into my own body. That's a problem for next turn. Let's plan ahead.\n\nFrom (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): blocked by my body (I have (4,6) in my body list).\n- DOWN to (4,4): empty? Row 4, col 4 is `.` empty.\n- LEFT to (3,5): empty next turn (since I'm moving from (3,5) to (4,5), (3,5) becomes empty).\n- RIGHT to (5,5): row 5, col 5 is `T` (my body? Wait, my body includes (5,5)? My body list: (5,5) is listed? Let's check my body: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6)]. Yes, (5,5) is in my body. So RIGHT to (5,5) is blocked.\n\nSo from (4,5), my only safe moves next turn would be DOWN to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,5). Both empty.\n\nBut wait, (4,4) is empty? Row 4, col 4 is `.` empty. Good.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have no choice but to move RIGHT to (4,5). It's the only move that keeps me alive. After that, I'll be at (4,5) with limited options (DOWN or LEFT). I need to think long-term.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go DOWN to (4,4), I'm moving back toward the enemy? Enemy is at (4,2) below. That might be risky if they move up. But I have higher score, so I could force a collision. However, I want to stay alive and eat apples. The apples are at the top: (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), etc. From (4,5), going DOWN moves me away from apples. Going LEFT to (3,5) is safe but also moves me away from apples.\n\nBut (3,5) is where I was last turn. From (3,5), I can go RIGHT again to (4,5) (which will be empty next turn) or DOWN to (3,4) (blocked by my body? Actually, (3,4) will be empty next turn because my head moved? Wait, my body moves: when I move from (3,5) to (4,5), my tail moves? I didn't eat an apple, so my tail moves forward. The cell (3,4) becomes empty? Let's simulate: My body is currently: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (2,4), ... tail at (8,6)? Actually my tail is at (8,6)? My body list ends with (8,6). But I have many segments. When I move to (4,5), my new body becomes: head at (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), ... and the tail (8,6) moves forward? Wait, the tail moves only if I don't eat. So the last segment (tail) is removed. The tail was at (8,6)? Actually my body list: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6)]. That's 16 segments (since I have 16 apples, body length = apples + 1? Actually, each apple adds one segment. Starting length 3? I'm not sure. But the tail is (8,6). When I move to (4,5) without eating, the new body becomes: head at (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), ... and the last segment (8,6) is removed. So (3,4) will still be in my body (second segment). So (3,4) remains occupied. So from (4,5), going LEFT to (3,5) is safe (will be empty after my move? Actually, after I move, (3,5) becomes part of my body (second segment). So if I go LEFT to (3,5) next turn, that's moving into my own body? No, because by next turn, (3,5) will be my second segment, so moving into it would be suicide. Wait, careful: When I move, the head moves to new cell, and the body shifts. The cell I leave becomes part of the body? Actually, the body follows the head. After moving to (4,5), my body will be: head at (4,5), then previous head position (3,5) becomes first body segment, then (3,4), etc. So (3,5) is occupied by my body after the move. So if I try to go LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5) in the next turn, that would be moving into my own body. So LEFT is not safe next turn. Similarly, DOWN to (4,4) would be safe because (4,4) is empty. So from (4,5), only DOWN to (4,4) is safe next turn? Check: (4,4) is empty and will remain empty (since my body won't be there). So DOWN is the only safe move from (4,5).\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (4,5) leads to a dead end: next turn I must go DOWN to (4,4). From (4,4), what are options? Let's see board: row 4, col 4 is empty. From (4,4), I can go UP to (4,5) (which will be empty next turn? Actually after moving from (4,5) to (4,4), (4,5) becomes part of my body? Wait, I'm moving DOWN from (4,5) to (4,4). So my head goes to (4,4), and (4,5) becomes body segment. So from (4,4), UP to (4,5) is blocked by my own body. LEFT to (3,4) is blocked by my body (since (3,4) is in my body). RIGHT to (5,4) is empty? Row 4, col 5 is `.` empty. DOWN to (4,3) is empty? Row 3, col 4 is empty. So from (4,4), I can go RIGHT to (5,4) or DOWN to (4,3). Both are safe.\n\nSo the path is: RIGHT to (4,5) -> DOWN to (4,4) -> then RIGHT or DOWN. This moves me toward the bottom-right area, away from top apples. But there is an apple at (9,3) and (9,8) and (9,0). Maybe I can pivot to the right side.\n\nAlternatively, could I have moved DOWN last turn? Last turn I was at (3,4) and chose UP to (3,5). If I had moved RIGHT last turn to (4,4), I'd be at (4,4) now. From (4,4), I could go UP to (4,5) (safe), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4) (empty), RIGHT to (5,4). More options. But I didn't. I'm here now.\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE:**\nI have only one safe move: RIGHT to (4,5). I must take it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Move RIGHT to (4,5) to survive.\n- Next turn, move DOWN to (4,4) (only safe move).\n- From (4,4), consider moving RIGHT toward the right side apples (9,3), (9,8) or even (9,0). The enemy is trapped in the bottom-left. I can try to circle around and box them in from the right.\n- Avoid getting trapped in the top-left by my own body. I need to clear space by letting my tail catch up.\n- Be ready for head-on collision if enemy moves up toward me. I have higher score, so I win.\n\n**LET'S GOOO!** \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

(that's (4,4) - EMPTY!)\n\nSo (4,4) is indeed empty! I can move DOWN!\n\n**REVISED OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP (4,6):** DEAD - My body at (4,6)\n2. **DOWN (4,4):** SAFE - Empty board cell, not in my body\n3. **LEFT (3,5):** DEAD - (3,5) will be my body after this move? No, (3,5) is currently my head position, but after moving, it becomes part of my body. Moving LEFT into (3,5) would be moving into my own body? Wait, I'm at (4,5) NOW. Moving LEFT would go to (3,5). (3,5) is currently empty (it's where my head was). After I move, (3,5) will become part of my body. But if I move LEFT to (3,5) this turn, I'm moving into a cell that will be my body NEXT turn, but is EMPTY THIS TURN. The rules say: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" (3,5) is NOT my body THIS TURN. It's empty. So moving LEFT to (3,5) is actually SAFE this turn! But wait, the board shows row 5: \"T T . T 0 T T T . .\" - column 3 is \"T\" - that's (3,5)? No, row 5, column 3 is \"T\" - that's (3,5)? Actually, row 5 is y=5. Column 3 is x=3. So (3,5) shows \"T\" on the board! That means (3,5) IS occupied! But my head is at (4,5) now. (3,5) is showing \"T\" - that's my body! Yes, my body includes (3,5)? Wait, my body list starts at (3,4), then (2,4), etc. It doesn't include (3,5)! But the board shows (3,5) as \"T\". That must be from my previous body position. Let me trace: My head moved to (4,5) this turn? No, I haven't moved yet. Currently at turn 29, my head is at (4,5)? The input says \"Head: (4, 5)\". Yes! So currently, my head is at (4,5). And the board shows (4,5) as \"0\" (my head). And (3,5) shows \"T\". That means my body occupies (3,5). But my body list doesn't show (3,5)! There's an inconsistency.\n\nLet me re-read the board carefully:\nRow 5: \"T T . T 0 T T T . .\"\nColumns: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:T, 4:0, 5:T, 6:T, 7:T, 8:., 9:.\n\nSo at (3,5): column 3, row 5 = \"T\" - occupied by my body.\nAt (4,5): column 4, row 5 = \"0\" - my head.\nAt (5,5): column 5, row 5 = \"T\" - my body.\n\nBut my body list: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6)]\n\nThis list does NOT include (3,5) or (4,5) or (5,5) as body? Wait, it includes (5,5) at the end. But not (3,5) or (4,5). So the board must be showing my HEAD and BODY positions from the CURRENT state, but my body list might be from BEFORE the last move? Let's check the turn: Turn 29. The board state is CURRENT. My head is at (4,5). My body should include (3,5) now because I moved from (3,5) to (4,5) last turn? But the last move I made was RIGHT (from turn 28 rationale). In turn 28, I was at (3,5) and moved RIGHT to (4,5). So yes, after that move, my body would have (3,5) as the first segment. But the body list provided doesn't include (3,5). That's a problem.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The body list might be outdated or incomplete. I must trust the BOARD STATE for current positions. The board shows:\n- (4,5): 0 (my head)\n- (3,5): T (my body)\n- (5,5): T (my body)\n\nSo moving LEFT to (3,5) would be moving into my own body! DEAD.\nMoving RIGHT to (5,5) would be moving into my own body! DEAD.\nMoving UP to (4,6): board shows row 6, col 4 is \"T\" (from row 6: \". T T T T T . T . .\"), so (4,6) is my body. DEAD.\nMoving DOWN to (4,4): board shows row 4, col 4 is \".\" - empty! SAFE.\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE: DOWN to (4,4)**\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nMoving DOWN to (4,4) puts me closer to the enemy at (4,3). With my higher score (16 vs 8), if we collide head-on, I win! But I don't want to force it yet - I need to stay alive and maybe trap them. From (4,4), I can then move DOWN to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,4) or LEFT to (3,4) (but (3,4) is my body). Actually, (3,4) is my body according to the list, but board shows (3,4) as \"T\" in row 4. So LEFT is blocked. So from (4,4), my options would be DOWN to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,4). Both are empty? (4,3) shows \"1\" (enemy head? No, enemy head is at (4,3) according to input! Wait, enemy head is at (4,3). So (4,3) is OCCUPIED by enemy head! If I move DOWN to (4,4) this turn, then next turn if I move DOWN to (4,3), that would be moving into the enemy's body? But the enemy might move. However, (4,3) is currently occupied by enemy head, so I cannot move there this turn.\n\nSo from (4,4) next turn, I cannot go DOWN because (4,3) has enemy head. I could go RIGHT to (5,4) which is empty. So I need to plan to go RIGHT.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMOVE DOWN to (4,4). This is the only move that keeps me alive. From there, I'll pivot right toward the apples on the right side and avoid the enemy below.\n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

He's now at my 4 o'clock position.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (4,5):** DEAD - That's my old head position from last turn, now part of my body. Hitting myself = death.\n2. **DOWN to (4,3):** DEAD - Enemy head was just there last turn, and he moved RIGHT. (4,3) should be empty now? Wait, check the board: Row 3 shows \"A A . . T 1 . A . A\". Column 4 is \"T\" - that's (4,3)? No, row 3 is y=3. Column 4 is x=4. So (4,3) shows \"T\". That must be the enemy's *body* trailing behind him? Or my body? Let's trace: Enemy was at (4,3) last turn, now at (5,3). His body stretches back left: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), etc. So (4,3) is now occupied by the enemy's body. Moving into it = death. Also, my own body is at (3,4) left of me, but not (4,3).\n3. **LEFT to (3,4):** DEAD - Board shows row 4: \"T T T T . . . . . .\" Column 3 is \"T\". That's my body.\n4. **RIGHT to (5,4):** EMPTY? Check board: Row 4, column 5 is \".\" (from the row: \"T T T T . . . . . .\"). It's empty! Also not in enemy body (enemy is at y=3). So RIGHT is the ONLY SAFE MOVE.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI'm forced RIGHT to (5,4). From there, I need to watch the enemy at (5,3). If he moves UP to (5,4) next turn, we collide head-on. I have 16 apples vs his 8. If we collide, I WIN because I have more apples. But I don't want to rush it\u2014I want to box him in first. From (5,4), I can go UP to (5,5) (my body, dead), DOWN to (5,3) (enemy body, dead), or RIGHT to (6,4). (6,4) is likely empty based on the board. So I'll go RIGHT next turn to escape the column and try to trap him against the right wall or my body.\n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break this down!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (5, 4) - I just moved RIGHT from (4, 4) last turn.\n- **My Body:** From the board: Row 6: (1,6)-(5,6) blocked. Row 5: (1,5)-(7,5) blocked (including my head at (5,4)? Wait, body is behind head. My body stretches back left: (4,4) is now the segment behind my head, then (4,5), etc.\n- **Enemy Position:** (6, 3) - He moved RIGHT from (5, 3) last turn. He's now at my 4 o'clock position.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (5, 5):** DEAD - That's my body. Board shows row 5, column 5 is \"T\". Hitting myself = death.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 3):** DEAD - Enemy head was at (5,3) last turn, now at (6,3). His body stretches back left to (5,3). Board shows row 3, column 5 is \"T\" (enemy body). Moving into it = death.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 4):** DEAD - That's my own body (the segment behind my head). Board shows row 4, column 4 is \"T\". Hitting myself = death.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 4):** EMPTY? Check board: Row 4, column 6 is \".\" (from the row: \"T T T T . . . . . .\"). It's empty! Also not in enemy body (enemy is at y=3). So RIGHT is the ONLY SAFE MOVE.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI'm forced RIGHT to (6, 4). From there, I need to watch the enemy at (6, 3). If he moves UP to (6, 4) next turn, we collide head-on. I have 16 apples vs his 8. If we collide, I WIN because I have more apples. But I want to box him in first. From (6, 4), I can go UP to (6, 5) (likely empty), DOWN to (6, 3) (enemy body, dead), LEFT back to (5, 4) (my body, dead), or RIGHT to (7, 4) (likely empty). I'll go UP to (6, 5) next turn to cut off his escape upwards and try to trap him against the right wall or my body.\n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent\u2019s length will make turning tight, so every extra apple I grab widens my safety net. Should the rival try to cut off column\u202f9, I\u2019ll simply zig\u2011zag left a step and re\u2011enter the column from above \u2013 the space is huge enough.\n\n**Move:**  \n\nRIGHT",

Board shows row 5, col 6 is \"T\"? Wait, row 5 is \"T T . T T T . . . .\" - col 6 is \"T\" (my body). Actually, from my body list: (5,6) is part of my tail. But (6,5) is currently empty!

Moving into enemy body = death.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):** DEAD - That's my own body (immediate segment behind head). Hitting myself = death.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):** SAFE? Check board: row 4, col 7 is \".\" (from row 4: \"T T T T T T 0 . . .\" - after head at 6, col 7 is empty). Not in enemy body (enemy at y=3). SAFE.\n\n**DECISION:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe. RIGHT (7, 4) gets me closer to the enemy and potential apples on row 3 or 4. UP (6, 5) moves me away but might cut off his escape upward. However, moving RIGHT to (7,4) positions me directly right of the enemy's head at (7,3). If he moves UP to (7,4) next turn, we collide\u2014head-on collision! With my score 16 vs his 9, I WIN. That's the aggression we need! If he moves elsewhere, I can chase him down. RIGHT is the aggressive play to force the collision or box him in.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (7,4) to threaten head-on collision. If he moves UP into me, I win. If he moves LEFT or DOWN, I can pursue and trap him against my body or the wall. Keep the pressure on!\n\nLET'S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

Let's see what the enemy did...**\n\n**RIVAL CHECK:**\nFrom the board state:\n- Snake #1 is now at head (8, 3) - wait, that's the same as before? No, looking at the board, row 3 shows \"A A . . T T T T 1 A\". That indicates the enemy head is at (8, 3)? But the body list says head (8, 3) with body starting at (7, 3). That means he moved RIGHT from (7, 3) to (8, 3)!\n- My head: (7, 4) - I moved RIGHT as planned.\n\n**CRITICAL MOMENT:** We are now ADJACENT! My head at (7, 4), his head at (8, 3). We're diagonally adjacent, not head-on.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (7, 4)\n- **My Body:** Behind me is (6, 4) (immediate left), then the rest of my snake extends left and up.\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 3)\n- **Enemy Body:** From (8, 3) back to (7, 3), (6, 3), etc.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (7, 5):** Check board row 5, col 7: from row 5 \"T T . T T T . . . .\", col 7 is \".\" - empty. Enemy at y=3. SAFE.\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3):** DEAD - Enemy body is there! (Enemy head at 8,3, body at 7,3). Moving into enemy body = death.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4):** DEAD - My own body is there (immediate behind head). Hitting myself = death.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Check board row 4, col 8: from row 4 \"T T T T T T T 0 . .\", col 8 is \".\" - empty. Enemy at y=3. SAFE.\n\n**DECISION ANALYSIS:**\nBoth UP (7, 5) and RIGHT (8, 4) are safe. UP moves me away from the enemy horizontally but increases y. RIGHT moves me toward the enemy's current position but to the right.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:** The enemy just moved RIGHT from (7,3) to (8,3). He's against the right wall (col 9 is boundary). I have him boxed in! If I move RIGHT to (8, 4), I'll be above him at (8,3). Then next turn, he has limited moves: he can only go UP (8,4) but that would collide with me if I stay, or LEFT (7,3) but that's his own body (since his body chain goes (7,3)->(6,3)...). Actually, his body is at (7,3), so if he moves LEFT back to (7,3), he'd hit his own body! So he's trapped!\n\n**THE PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (8, 4). This positions me directly above his head. He's at (8, 3) with body extending left. He cannot go LEFT (his own body), cannot go DOWN (y=2 but check... actually y=2 might be safe but he's at bottom of his movement? Wait y=3, down is y=2). Actually, let's think: He's at (8,3). His possible moves:\n- UP: (8,4) - would collide with me if I'm there\n- DOWN: (8,2) - check board row 2, col 8: \"T T T T T . . . . A\" - col 8 is \".\" - empty, but wait his body chain? His body is at (7,3), (6,3), etc. (8,2) is empty. But would he go DOWN? Possibly.\n- LEFT: (7,3) - his own body (immediate behind head) = death\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - but x=9 is the right wall? Actually board is 0-9, so x=9 is valid. Check row 3, col 9: \"A A . . T T T T 1 A\" - col 9 is \"A\" - apple! So he could go RIGHT to (9,3) to eat apple.\n\nBut I want to trap him. If I go RIGHT to (8,4), then if he goes UP to (8,4), head-on collision - I WIN (16 vs 9). If he goes RIGHT to (9,3) to eat apple, then I can pursue.\n\nAlternatively, UP to (7,5) gives me more space but lets him potentially escape upward.\n\n**BEST PLAY:** RIGHT to (8,4). This maximizes pressure. I'm boxing him in against the right wall. My score advantage means if he tries to force collision, I win. Let's go for the aggressive trap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (8,4). If he moves UP into me, I win. If he moves RIGHT to (9,3), next turn I can chase him along the top wall. If he moves DOWN, I can follow. Force him into a corner!\n\nLET'S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8 trap is closing!\n\nRIGHT",

That puts him at (9,3) as head, body extending left to (8,3).\n- **If I go UP (8,5):** I move away from him, giving him room. He grows and becomes more dangerous. Not ideal for trapping.\n- **If I go RIGHT (9,4):** I move to the top-right corner, directly above his predicted position (9,3). This boxes him in against the right wall and top wall. He'll have no escape routes!\n- **Score Advantage:** I have 16 apples vs his 10. If he tries a head-on collision, I WIN. I should force him into corners, not run.\n\n**THE KILLER PLAY: RIGHT to (9,4)**\nThis is the ultimate trap position! Next turn, the enemy will be at (9,3) with body at (8,3). I'll be at (9,4) directly above him. His only moves will be:\n- UP into me (head-on collision - I WIN 16 vs 11)\n- LEFT into his own body at (8,3) - DEAD\n- DOWN to (9,2) - check board row 2, col 9: \"T T T T T . . . .

If he goes LEFT into his own body, he's dead. If he goes DOWN to (9,2), I will chase him down the right wall - I have the corner advantage and score lead. Keep him boxed in against the walls!\"\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE MOMENT!** We're boxing him in, forcing him into a corner where he can't maneuver. My score advantage means I can play aggressively.

Now 18 apples vs enemy's 12. HUGE LEAD!\n- **Enemy Head:** (9,0) - He moved DOWN from (9,1) last turn to eat the apple at (9,0). Now he's at the bottom-right corner!\n- **Enemy Body:** Now from (9,1) down to (1,2) - He's stretched along the bottom and right side!\n- **Apple at (8,7)** - Two cells UP from me! That's our next target! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (8,5):**\n1. **UP to (8,6):** Row 6, col 8: \" . . . . . . . . .\" - EMPTY! **SAFE** but no apple. However... let me think ahead.\n2. **DOWN to (8,4):** Row 4, col 8: \" T T T T T T T T T\" - col 8 is \"T\" - **MY OWN BODY!** DEAD! \n3. **LEFT to (7,5):** Row 5, col 7: \" . . . . . . . 0\" - Wait, I need to check carefully. Row 5 shows: \" T T . T T . . . 0 T\" - col 7 is empty! **SAFE**. No apple though.\n4. **RIGHT to (9,5):** Row 5, col 9: \" T\" - **MY OWN BODY!** DEAD!\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP (8,6) and LEFT (7,5)\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION - CRITICAL!**\nHe's at (9,0) in the bottom-right corner. His options:\n- UP to (9,1): **MY BODY!** (9,1) is part of my body chain? Let's check: My body starts at (9,5) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (8,4)... so (9,1) is NOT my body. But (9,1) is his OLD body position! He just came from (9,1) to (9,0). So moving BACK to (9,1) would be into his own body? Actually no - his body stretched from (9,1) to (9,2)... so (9,1) is now part of his tail! He CAN'T go UP.\n- LEFT to (8,0): **EMPTY!** This is his ONLY safe move!\n- RIGHT to (10,0): **OFF BOARD!** DEAD!\n- DOWN to (9,-1): **OFF BOARD!** DEAD!\n\n**HE'S FORCED TO GO LEFT TO (8,0)!** No choice!\n\n**THE KILL BOX PLAN:**\nIf I go UP to (8,6):\n- I'm at (8,6), apple at (8,7) above me\n- Enemy goes LEFT to (8,0) - far away from me\n- Next turn I can EAT the apple at (8,7) and grow to 19!\n- My body grows by 1, but I keep control of the upper board\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,5):\n- I'm at (7,5), no apple\n- Enemy goes LEFT to (8,0)\n- Next turn I'm farther from the apple at (8,7)\n- Less optimal positioning for hunting\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY: UP to (8,6) \ud83c\udfaf**\n\n**WHY THIS IS CRUSHING:**\n1. **Safe move** - (8,6) is empty\n2. **Positions for apple** - Next turn I can EAT (8,7) and get to 19 apples (19 vs 12 = +7 lead!)\n3. **Enemy is trapped** - He's stuck at (8,0) with no good options (only (7,0) or (8,1) next turn, both may be dangerous)\n4. **Dominate the board** - I'm controlling the upper board while he's stuck in the corner\n5. **Head-on collision prep** - With my lead growing, I can start hunting him down later if I want to force a collision\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS HOW WE BOX HIM IN!** He's at (8,0) with only one move left to make! I'm taking the apple route and stretching my lead! We're not just surviving, we're DOMINATING! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

Right into my planned path!\n- **Enemy Body:** From (7, 0) down to (4, 2) - Still stretched along the bottom\n- **Apples:** (9, 8) is RIGHT ABOVE ME! That's the immediate target. Also (6, 8) and (7, 2) are options.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (9, 7):**\n1. **UP to (9, 8):** Row 8, col 9: \"A\" - **AN APPLE!** I eat and grow to 19 apples!\n2. **DOWN to (9, 6):** Row 6, col 9: \"T\" - That's MY BODY! DEAD!\n3. **LEFT to (8, 7):** Row 7, col 8: \"T\" - Also MY BODY from my previous head position! DEAD!\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 7):** OFF BOARD! DEAD!\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE:** UP to (9, 8) - EAT THE APPLE!\n**KILL MOVES:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all dead)\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (7, 1) with options:\n- **UP to (7, 2):** Row 2, col 7: \"A\" - **AN APPLE!** He'll likely eat this!\n- **DOWN to (7, 0):** Row 0, col 7: \"1\" - HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n- **LEFT to (6, 1):** Row 1, col 6: \"A\" - Another apple! Safe but no growth\n- **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Row 1, col 8: \"1\" - HIS OWN BODY from (8,0)? Wait, checking... Row 1: \" . . . . . . A 1 . T\" - (8,1) shows \"1\", but that's his tail from previous turns. Actually, his body is at (8,0), (9,0), etc. (8,1) should be empty. Let me check board... Row 1 shows \"1\" at position 7 (x=7) which is his head, and \"T\" at position 9 (x=9). So (8,1) is empty! **SAFE!**\n\nActually re-checking the board state:\nRow 1: \" . . . . . . A 1 . T\"\n- x=6: A (apple)\n- x=7: 1 (enemy head)\n- x=8: . (empty)\n- x=9: T (tail?)\n\nWait, looking at the snake #1 body: (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nSo (9,1) IS part of his body! So (9,1) is \"T\". But (8,1) is NOT in his body list. So (8,1) is empty.\n\nSo enemy has **THREE SAFE OPTIONS**: UP to (7,2) [apple], LEFT to (6,1) [apple], or RIGHT to (8,1) [empty].\n\nGiven his position and the apples, he'll likely go UP or LEFT for the apples. He's going for growth.\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY: UP to (9, 8) \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf**\n\n**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE GROWTH!** I eat the apple at (9, 8), going to 19 apples and growing my tail\n2. **BLOCKING THE ENEMY!** From (9, 8), I'm positioned to potentially intercept if he tries to go right/up\n3. **MAINTAINING THE TRAP!** My body is forming a wall on the right side, boxing him in the bottom-left corner\n4. **EXPANDING MY LEAD!** 19 apples vs his 12 (or 13 if he eats) - I'm pulling further ahead\n5. **POSITIONAL DOMINANCE!** I control the entire right edge while he's stuck at bottom-left\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE CLIMB!** He's trapped in the corner with limited moves while I'm feasting on the top-right! Every apple I eat is another segment of the board I own. The trap is closing! He can't reach me without crashing through my body, and I'm growing stronger every turn!\n\nUP",

Probably ate the apple at (7, 2) or moved somewhere smart.\n- **Enemy Body:** Still stretched along the bottom-left\n- **Apples:** I see apples at (4,9), (3,9), (0,9), (1,9), (6,9), (5,9), (1,3), (2,7), (0,3), (4,7), (2,0), (6,8), (7,2), (6,6), (9,9)\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (9, 8):**\n1. **UP to (9, 9):** Row 9, col 9: \"A\" - **AN APPLE!** Perfect!

Good positioning!\n- **My Body:** Stretches across the right side, I'm still anchored there\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 2) - Predicted move! He went RIGHT to eat the apple at (7, 2) like I thought. Now he's at (7, 2).\n- **Enemy Body:** Same as before, no changes\n- **Apples:** (4, 9), (3, 9), (0, 9), (1, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (1, 3), (2, 7), (0, 3), (4, 7), (2, 0), (6, 8), (6, 6), (5, 5), (7, 7)\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (8, 9):**\n1. **LEFT to (7, 9):** Row 9, col 7: \".\" - **SAFE!** Opens up (6,9) apple next!\n2. **DOWN to (8, 8):** Row 8, col 8: \".\" - Safe, but leads toward center\n3. **UP or RIGHT:** Off board! DEAD!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (from (7, 2)):**\n- **UP to (7, 3):** Row 3, col 7: \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD for him!\n- **DOWN to (7, 1):** Row 1, col 7: \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD for him!\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** Row 2, col 6: \"T\" - HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n- **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Row 2, col 8: \"T\" - HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!** The enemy is **TRAPPED** at (7, 2)! All four directions lead to death for him! That means on this turn (43), he's **GOING TO DIE NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES!**\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nThis is HUGE! If the enemy dies this turn, I WIN IMMEDIATELY! I don't even need to eat apples anymore - I just need to stay alive and watch him crash! \n\nMy options: LEFT to (7, 9) or DOWN to (8, 8). Both are safe from collision with his body (since he's at (7,2) and I'm far away). \n\nBut I should choose the move that guarantees MY survival in case something unexpected happens. **LEFT to (7, 9)** is perfect - it's away from his location, on the top row with apples waiting, and keeps me moving toward the center. Even if he somehow survives (he won't), I'm still in a great position.\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE: LEFT to (7, 9)** \ud83d\udc0d\n- **SAFE:** No collision risk, he's at (7,2)\n- **POSITIONING:** Top row, apple at (6,9) is next!\n- **ENEMY STATUS:** TRAPPED! He's dead next turn!\n- **GAME STATE:** This could be the WINNING TURN!\n\nChat, this is it! The enemy is boxed in his own body! I'm sweeping left on the top row, and next turn I'll be able to grab that apple at (6,9) while watching him crash out! 20 vs 14, we're about to make it 20 vs 0!\n\nLEFT",

Perfect.\n- **My Body:** Same as before, anchored across the right side.\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 2) - **WAIT!** He's ALIVE?! Let's check... His last head was (7, 2). According to the board, his head is now (8, 2). That means on turn 43, he **DIDN'T DIE**. He must have moved RIGHT into an empty cell? Let me re-examine the board state from turn 43...\n\n**RE-EVALUATING ENEMY MOVEMENT:**\nAt turn 43, enemy head was at (7, 2). The board showed:\n- (7, 3): \"T\" (MY body)\n- (7, 1): \"T\" (MY body) \n- (6, 2): \"T\" (HIS body from previous positions)\n- (8, 2): \"T\" (HIS body from previous positions)\n\nActually, looking at the current board state at turn 44, I see the enemy head is at (8, 2) with body extending down. That means he must have moved to (8, 2) which was **NOT** his own body in the previous state. He survived! My previous prediction was wrong.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (7, 9):**\n1. **LEFT to (6, 9):** Row 9, col 6: \"A\" - **APPLE!** SAFE! But wait... is this occupied? Board shows \"A\" - apple is there, no snake body. SAFE.\n2. **DOWN to (7, 8):** Row 8, col 7: \".\" - Safe empty space.\n3. **UP or RIGHT:** Off board! DEAD!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (from (8, 2)):**\n- **UP to (8, 3):** Row 3, col 8: \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD for him!\n- **DOWN to (8, 1):** Row 1, col 8: \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD for him!\n- **LEFT to (7, 2):** Row 2, col 7: \".\" - Safe! (Empty)\n- **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Row 2, col 9: \"T\" - HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n\n**ENEMY TRAPPED AGAIN!** From (8, 2), only LEFT to (7, 2) is safe for him. He's back in a corner of his own body.\n\n**MY MOVE STRATEGY:**\nI'm at (7, 9). LEFT to (6, 9) gets me an apple and grows to 21 apples! That's more content and keeps me ahead 21 vs 14. DOWN to (7, 8) is also safe but gets me no apple.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7, 2) and I move LEFT to (6, 9), we're far apart - no collision risk. Perfect.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (6, 9)! Keep the pressure on. With 21 apples, I'm dominating. The enemy is stuck in a loop - he can only move left to (7, 2) or die. Eventually he'll run out of moves or I'll corner him. Keep growing, keep dominating!\n\n**LEFT**",
