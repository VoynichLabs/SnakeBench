Empty body.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (8, 6). Empty body.\n- **Board State:** 10x10 grid. Lots of apples scattered.\n- **Immediate Threats:** None yet, since bodies are empty. But we need to watch the enemy's move!\n- **Strategic Goal:** We need to move towards apples but ALSO position to cut off the enemy. He's at (8, 6), which is on the right side (upper right quadrant). I'm on the left (bottom left). If I move RIGHT immediately, I start closing the distance. If I move UP or DOWN, I stay on the edge but might be too passive.\n\n**CONSIDERING MOVES:**\n1. **LEFT:** Head (0, 1) -> (-1, 1). **OFF BOARD.** DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN:** Head (0, 1) -> (0, 0). SAFE. (0, 0) is empty (based on the board map: row 0, col 0 is '.'). But (0, 0) is a dead end on the bottom-left corner. I'd have fewer escape routes next turn. That's getting \"boxed in.\" \u274c\n3. **UP:** Head (0, 1) -> (0, 2). SAFE. (0, 2) is empty (row 2, col 0 is '.'). This keeps me on the left edge but goes vertical. Good to avoid the corner.\n4. **RIGHT:** Head (0, 1) -> (1, 1). SAFE. (1, 1) is empty? Wait, checking the map: Row 1, Col 1 is '0' (my head). Row 1, Col 2 is 'A'. So (1, 1) is currently empty. This moves me toward the center and the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 6). It also starts bridging the gap to the enemy.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMoving DOWN is a trap (corner). UP is safe but vertical. RIGHT moves us toward the action and the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 6). It also puts us in a better position to react to where the enemy goes. If I go RIGHT, I open up the path to the center. If I go UP, I might end up chasing apples vertically while the enemy eats in the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominance. The enemy is at (8, 6). We need to sweep the board or cut him off. Going RIGHT puts us on a collision course or allows us to secure the left-center sector. I'll aim to snake through the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 6) while keeping an eye on the enemy's trajectory. If he moves left, we box him in. If he moves right/up, we take the center.\n\n**VERDICT:** I'm taking **RIGHT** to engage the board immediately.\n\nRIGHT",

Time to close the distance and secure the territory! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\n**ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (1, 1). Body: None.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (9, 6). Body: [(8, 6)]. Apples: 1.\n- **Score:** I'm down 0-1. I need to eat, but more importantly, I need to cut off his access to the center and left side.\n- **Board Layout:** Lots of apples scattered. The enemy is in the top right (9,6). I need to push right and up to dominate the board. If I go left or down, I trap myself in a corner while he eats freely in the center/right.\n\n**CONSIDERING MOVES:**\n1. **LEFT:** Head (1, 1) -> (0, 1). SAFE. But this is backtracking. I started at (0,1) last turn. This puts me back on the edge and gives the enemy the whole center. Bad for control. \u274c\n2. **DOWN:** Head (1, 1) -> (1, 0). SAFE. (1,0) is empty ('.'). But moving down towards the bottom edge limits my mobility. I want to expand, not contract. \u274c\n3. **UP:** Head (1, 1) -> (1, 2). SAFE. (1,2) is empty. This moves me vertically, keeping me on the left edge. It's safe, but it doesn't pressure the enemy or get me to the juicy apples in the center. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT:** Head (1, 1) -> (2, 1). SAFE. (2, 1) contains an Apple ('A'). This is the play! I eat immediately (+1 point, equalizing the score) and move into the central zone. This positions me to control the left-center. From (2,1), I have access to (2,6) apple and can move towards the center to box the enemy in.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:**\nBoxing in. The enemy is at (9,6). He's stuck in the top right corner. If I move RIGHT to (2,1), I establish a presence in the middle. My next moves will be UP towards (2,6) or (4,4), effectively cutting off his escape routes down the left side. I need to force him into a corner.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**RIGHT** is the only move that scores points immediately and advances my position towards the center.

Coordinates: Right is +X, Up is +Y.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (9, 5) with Body [(9, 6)]. He's stuck way in the top-right corner. He\u2019s not an immediate threat, but I need to close the distance and take control of the center.\n3.  **Board State Check:**\n    *   **UP (2, 1) -> (2, 2):** Safe (empty). Moves me vertically up the left side.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 1) -> (2, 0):** Safe (empty). Moves me to the bottom edge.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1) -> (1, 1):** **DEATH!** That\u2019s my own body segment. I can\u2019t turn back into myself.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 1) -> (3, 1):** Safe (empty). Moves me further right into the center.\n4.  **Strategy & Content:**\n    *   **LEFT** is a suicide run. Hard pass.\n    *   **DOWN** takes me to (2, 0). It\u2019s safe, but it\u2019s a dead end along the bottom wall. I\u2019ll lose mobility. I want to expand, not get trapped.\n    *   **UP** to (2, 2) is safe and opens up paths to the apples at (2, 6) or (3, 7).\n    *   **RIGHT** to (3, 1) is also safe. It pushes me toward the center, closer to the cluster of apples at (3, 2) and (4, 0).\n    *   **The Play:** I need to dominate the center. Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 1) puts me directly in the flow of action. From there, I can cut off the enemy's access to the left side. If I go up to (2, 2), I'm stuck hugging the left wall. I want to be in his face.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nI'm cutting across the board. **RIGHT** is the move to close the gap and set up the blockade. Let\u2019s bring the heat! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nPush right to (3,1). Next turn, I'm eyeing the apple at (4,0) or moving up to (3,2). I need to build a wall between me and the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m at (3,1) after last turn's move. The enemy is at (8,5) but that body is blocking his way out of the corner.

If I play this right, I can trap him. He's currently blocked by the wall at x=9 and his own body at (9,5) and (9,6). He is effectively stuck.\n3.  **Board State Check:**\n    *   **UP (3, 1) -> (3, 2):** **APPLE!** (3,2) is listed in the Apple Drops. Safe move, grows me to 2 apples. Ties me with the enemy. Opens up access to (3,9) later.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 1) -> (3, 0):** Empty. Safe, but puts me on the bottom edge.

It moves me vertically toward the center. From (3,2), I can look at (4,2) or (3,3).\n    *   **Why not DOWN?** It's safe, but I'm not grabbing content. I need those apples to match the score.\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?** It's safe, but (4,1) is just a pass-through. (3,2) is value.\n    *   **The Play:** I need to grow. My score is lagging. **UP** grabs the apple at (3,2). This puts me directly below the cluster of apples at (3,7), (2,6), etc. I am claiming the center.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nI\u2019m hungry.

Let's size up the board and plan our next aggressive move to trap that enemy snake.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Status:** My head is at **(3, 2)**. My body is at **(3, 1)** and **(2, 1)**.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at **(8, 6)**. His body is **[(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6)]**. He's moving around the bottom right. He seems safe for now, but he's not growing immediately. He's probably going for an apple in that corner or making a wide turn.\n3.  **Safe Moves Check:**\n    *   **UP (3, 2) -> (3, 3):** Empty. Safe. Good vertical positioning.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 2) -> (3, 1):** **DEATH!** That's my own body. Can't go back into myself.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 2) -> (2, 2):** Empty. Safe. Moves me away from the center cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 2) -> (4, 2):** Empty. Safe. Moves me further right, potentially toward the enemy zone.\n4.  **Strategic Assessment:**\n    *   **Why not LEFT?** Moving to (2,2) is safe, but it's away from the action. The apples are mostly to the right/up (like (4,4), (5,5), (2,6)). I want to control the center and the left side. Going left feels passive.\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?** (4,2) is safe, but it's putting me closer to the enemy who is at x=8. If I rush right, I might cut off my own escape routes or walk into a trap.\n    *   **Why UP?** **(3, 3)** is the winner. It keeps me on the x=3 column, which is central. From here, I can go to (3,4) or jump to (4,4) next turn (there's an apple at (4,4)!). It keeps my options open to the top side of the board while maintaining distance from the enemy in the bottom right. It also moves me away from my body at (3,1), preventing potential self-collision issues later if I need to maneuver.\n    *   **Aggression:** I'm not looking to crash into him yet (score is tied), but I need to grow. (3,3) is a pivot point. It allows me to either chase the apple at (3,7) or the one at (4,4) next turn.\n    *   **Board Trap Potential:** If I stay central and high, I can eventually cut off the top of the board, forcing the enemy into a smaller area if he survives.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**UP** to (3,3). It's safe, maintains center control, and sets me up to grab high-value apples on the next turn while keeping the enemy at a distance.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nHead to (3,3). Next turn, assess if (4,4) is safe to snag (it's an apple!). If the enemy is closing in on the left side, I might need to pivot left, but for now, we hold the high ground.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n    *   **UP:** Head at (3,3) -> **(3,4)**.\n    *   **DOWN:** Head at (3,3) -> **(3,2)**.\n    *   **LEFT:** Head at (3,3) -> **(2,3)**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Head at (3,3) -> **(4,3)**.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **Check Board Boundaries:** All coordinates are within 0-9. No issues.\n    *   **Check Own Body:**\n        *   My current body: [(3,3) (Head), (3,2), (3,1)].\n        *   **UP (3,4):** Empty. **Safe.**\n        *   **DOWN (3,2):** This is my current neck. It is occupied by my body. If I go DOWN, I am moving *backwards* into my own body. **DEATH.**\n        *   **LEFT (2,3):** Empty. **Safe.**\n        *   **RIGHT (4,3):** Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **Check Enemy Body:** Snake #1 is at (8,7) with body [(8,6), (8,5), (9,5)]. None of the target cells (3,4), (2,3), (4,3) intersect with the enemy. **Safe.**\n\n3.  **Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions.**\n\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 (Head: 8,7) is in the top-right quadrant. Based on his body wrapping down the right side, he likely wants to go DOWN or LEFT to grab the apple at (7,4) or (6,2). He is far from me. Direct head-on collision this turn is impossible unless he crashes into a wall, but I need to position to force him into a trap later.\n\n    *   **Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n        *   **LEFT (2,3):**\n            *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves away from the enemy.\n            *   *Future Options:* From (2,3), I can go (2,4), (2,2), (1,3), or (3,3).\n            *   *Apple Proximity:* Nearest apples are (2,6) and (3,7). Moving to (2,3) is a good vertical path toward them.\n            *   *Aggression:* Moves me away from the enemy, but allows me to solidify the left side of the board. If I own the left, I can limit the enemy's space later.\n        *   **RIGHT (4,3):**\n            *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves toward the enemy.\n            *   *Future Options:* From (4,3), I can go (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3).\n            *   *Apple Proximity:* There is an apple at (4,4) (diagonal) and (5,5). This is a \"center\" route.\n            *   *Aggression:* Moving right brings me closer to the enemy's potential path. While risky, it keeps pressure on him. However, his score (3) is higher than mine (2). I should be cautious of a head-on collision if I don't grow. If I move to (4,3) and he moves to (7,6) or (6,7), the gap closes too fast.\n        *   **UP (3,4):**\n            *   *Safety:* Safe.\n            *   *Future Options:* From (3,4), I can go (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n            *   *Apple Proximity:* (2,6) and (3,7) are directly above. (4,4) is a diagonal apple.\n            *   *Aggression:* This keeps me central. It's a flexible move. However, (3,4) is currently empty, and staying on the x=3 axis keeps me in the middle of the board. The middle is dangerous because you can be squeezed from both sides.\n\n    *   **Decision Time:**\n        *   **DOWN is DEAD.**\n        *   **UP (3,4)** is a safe, central pivot.\n        *   **RIGHT (4,3)** moves toward the enemy but also toward apples. However, his score is 3 vs my 2. If I move right and he moves left/down, we close the distance.\n        *   **LEFT (2,3)** moves toward the bottom-left cluster of apples (2,6 is high value) and secures the left wall.\n\n    *   **Why LEFT (2,3)?**\n        Looking at the board state provided:\n        *   Apples at (0,3), (2,6), (3,9), (6,2).\n        *   Enemy at (8,7).\n        *   My current position (3,3) is central but vulnerable. By moving **LEFT** to (2,3), I am making a decisive move to claim the left side of the board.\n        *   From (2,3), I have a clear path up to (2,6) (an apple!) and (3,9) (an apple!). The path is largely open on the left.\n        *   Moving RIGHT puts me in the center where I can be trapped. Moving UP is okay, but LEFT offers a specific strategic advantage: I can \"box in\" the enemy by taking the left wall, forcing him to the right side where he eventually hits the wall at (9,9) or his own body.\n        *   The enemy is at x=8. I am at x=3. Increasing the distance is safer for now, as he is larger (length 4 vs my length 3).\n        *   Wait, actually, if I move LEFT to (2,3), I am moving *away* from the enemy, which is safer given he has more apples. I need to grow without dying.\n        *   Apples at (2,6) is a prime target. Moving to (2,3) gets me directly underneath it.\n        *   Let's re-verify safety. (2,3) is empty. No body collisions.\n        *   Long-term plan: Secure the left border (x=0 to x=4). Force enemy into the right side. If he comes left, I can retreat or ambush.\n\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?** Moving right to (4,3) is tempting because of (4,4) apple, but it's risky. If the enemy decides to rush the center, I might get cut off.\n    *   **Why not UP?** Up to (3,4) is neutral. It keeps options open but doesn't commit to a territory.\n\n    *   **Final Verdict:** The \"Boxing In\" strategy mentioned in the prompt implies controlling space. The left side is open. Taking it now establishes a boundary. I will move **LEFT** to (2,3) to position for the apple at (2,6) and wall off the left.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**LEFT** to (2,3). It secures the left side, opens a path to multiple apples, and maintains safe distance from the currently stronger enemy.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nMove to (2,3). Next turn, pivot UP towards (2,6) to eat an apple and grow. Establish the left border as my territory. Watch the enemy's movement\u2014if he pushes center, I hold the flank.\n\nLEFT",

WE CHOOSE UP.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n- Evaluate SAFE options: UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7) are all off our body and on-board.\n- DOWN would crash into our own neck; NOT SAFE.\n- Consider future space: UP keeps us near escape routes and lines us up to grab the apple cluster around the top edge, while preserving options to pressure the right edge later.\n- Avoid immediate head-on risk: opponent is far left; a direct head-on this turn isn\u2019t imminent.\n\nWHY UP OVER LEFT/RIGHT\n- UP maintains multiple safe follow-ups (toward (8,9) apple, (7,9)/(9,9) options) and keeps us marching toward the top-row apple cluster.\n- LEFT would nudge us away from the top edge and reduce immediate high-ground pressure.\n- RIGHT would inch toward the edge but could trap our own space if the opponent starts weaving around the right corridor.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE\n- Play aggressive but preserve two safe escape routes. Use the top-right corridor (near x=9) to set up a box with the wall and enemy\u2019s path, while chasing high-value apples near the top: (8,9) and nearby spots.\n- Force risk-for-reward head-ons only when we\u2019re up on apples and feel the rival is boxed or forced into a trap.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS\n- Turn 6: Push UP to (8,8) to threaten the top apple line and keep escape routes open.\n- Turn 7: If safe, continue UP to (8,9) to eat the apple there (and boost score advantage).\n- Turn 8: From (8,9), consider LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9) to corridoress and pressure the board edge, moving toward a potential box with the wall.\n- Maintain awareness of opponent\u2019s pivot options and avoid closing into a cul-de-sac.\n\nUP",

Time to execute the \"Box In\" strategy!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n    *   **UP:** (2, 4)\n    *   **DOWN:** (2, 2)\n    *   **LEFT:** (1, 3)\n    *   **RIGHT:** (3, 3) -> Wait! That's my own neck! My body is at (3,3). Moving Right goes back into myself? Let me check the board state again.\n    \n    *Self-Correction:* Wait a second, looking at the board state provided:\n    ```\n    3 A . 0 T . . . . . .\n    2 . . . T . . A A . .\n    1 . . . . . . . . A A\n    ```\n    My head is at **(2, 3)** (indicated by '0' in the row y=3, x=2).\n    My body is at **(3, 3)** and **(3, 2)** (indicated by 'T's).\n    *   **RIGHT (to 3,3):** That is my body! I cannot go there. **DEATH.**\n    *   **UP (to 2,4):** Currently empty on the board. Looks clear.\n    *   **DOWN (to 2,2):** Currently empty on the board. Looks clear.\n    *   **LEFT (to 1,3):** Currently empty on the board. Looks clear.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **RIGHT (3,3):** Occupied by my own body (the neck). **ILLEGAL. DEADLY.**\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8, 8) with a vertical tail. He is far away (Top Right). He cannot reach me this turn. No head-on collision risk immediately.\n\n3.  **Among remaining SAFE moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT), favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available.**\n    \n    *   **UP (2, 4):**\n        *   *Pros:* Moves me vertically up the left side. Direct path to the apple at (2, 6). Keeps me in column 2.\n        *   *Cons:* Slightly more central, but still on the left flank.\n    \n    *   **DOWN (2, 2):**\n        *   *Pros:* Moves towards the bottom-left corner (0,0). Tightens the space.\n        *   *Cons:* The bottom-left is a bit of a dead end with walls at x=0 and y=0. If I go down too far, I might trap myself. I need to eventually go UP to get the apples at (2,6) and (3,9).\n    \n    *   **LEFT (1, 3):**\n        *   *Pros:* Moves towards the left wall. Establishes territory on the border. Very safe long-term. From (1,3), I can go UP to (1,4) or DOWN to (1,2) or RIGHT back to (2,3). Open space.\n        *   *Cons:* Moves away from the immediate apple at (2,6), but puts me in position to cut off the left side entirely.\n\n    *   **Strategic Fit:**\n        The goal is to **BOX HIM IN**.\n        *   If I go **UP**, I start climbing the left wall. Good.\n        *   If I go **LEFT**, I hug the wall. Also good.\n        *   **RIGHT is death.**\n        *   **DOWN** is the only weak move because it corners me in the bottom left without securing the vertical wall yet.\n\n    *   **The Play:**\n        I need to secure the **Left Wall**.\n        Going **LEFT** to (1,3) is the safest way to start hugging the boundary. It puts me right against the edge, maximizing my board control on that side. From there, I can turn UP and snake along the wall to (0,9).\n        \n        Alternatively, **UP** to (2,4) is also solid because it starts the climb towards the apples immediately.\n        \n        However, looking at the board, the apple at (2,6) is directly above me. If I go **UP** now, I am one step closer to eating it and growing. If I go LEFT, I delay that growth.\n        \n        But wait! The prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I am BEHIND (2 vs 3). I need to grow safely.\n        \n        Let's look at the bottom-left: There is an apple at (0,3) and (6,0) and (0,3) is on my line. If I go LEFT to (1,3), I am right next to the apple at (0,3) for next turn!\n        \n        **VERDICT:**\n        I am at (2,3). My body is blocking my RIGHT.\n        **UP (2,4)** is the best move. It keeps me on the path to the apple at (2,6). It keeps me away from the bottom-left corner trap. It maintains flexibility. Moving DOWN is a trap. Moving LEFT delays my ascent to the center-apples.\n        \n        *Wait, let me check the board state one last time for the 'A' at (0,3).*\n        Row 3: `3 A . 0 T . . . . . .`\n        (0,3) is an Apple!\n        \n        If I go **LEFT to (1,3)**, I am next to the apple at (0,3). Next turn I can eat it! That guarantees growth.\n        If I go **UP to (2,4)**, I am chasing (2,6).\n        \n        (0,3) is closer (1 step away after this move) than (2,6) (2 steps away).\n        **Aggression requires growth.** Eating an apple is the best way to grow.\n        \n        **Decision: LEFT** to (1,3).\n        \n        Why?\n        1. It sets up an immediate apple eat next turn at (0,3).\n        2. It hugs the left wall, securing territory.\n        3. It avoids the death-move (RIGHT) and the corner trap (DOWN).\n        4. It is a safe, calculated step to close the score gap (2 vs 3).\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (1,3). On the next turn, move LEFT again to (0,3) to eat the apple and grow to length 4. After eating, turn UP and begin climbing the left wall towards the top-left corner. This secures the entire left flank and forces the enemy to the right side.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My opponent is still ahead (4 apples to my 2), but I'm right where I need to be to turn the tide.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n    *   **Current Head:** (1, 3)\n    *   **Body:** [(2, 3), (3, 3)]\n    *   **Potential Moves:**\n        *   **UP:** (1, 4)\n        *   **DOWN:** (1, 2)\n        *   **LEFT:** (0, 3)\n        *   **RIGHT:** (2, 3) -> **DEATH ZONE.** That's my own body! \ud83d\udc80\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 3):** Occupied by my body (the neck). **ILLEGAL. DEADLY.**\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8, 9). He is cornered in the top-right. If he goes DOWN, he hits his own tail (8, 8). If he goes LEFT, he's free. He is NOT an immediate threat to me this turn.\n\n3.  **ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES (UP, DOWN, LEFT):**\n    *   **UP (1, 4):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves toward the top-left corner. Keeps me mobile.\n        *   *Cons:* Moves AWAY from the guaranteed apple at (0, 3). I lose a growth opportunity.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 2):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* ?\n        *   *Cons:* Moves me toward the bottom-left corner. I don't need to go down there yet. (0, 3) is higher up. This delays growth.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3):**\n        *   *Status:* **APPLE A!** \ud83c\udf4e\n        *   *Pros:* **IMMEDIATE GROWTH.** I catch up to 3 apples (vs enemy 4). I hug the left wall (optimal strategy). I secure territory. After eating, I have full freedom to turn UP or DOWN from the wall.\n        *   *Cons:* None. It's safe and profitable.\n\n**STRATEGIC VERDICT:**\nI said I was going to eat that apple at (0, 3) last turn (and I moved to (1, 3) to set it up). Now I'm here. The enemy is busy surviving in the corner. I need to grow to close the gap.\n\n**MOVE:** **LEFT**\n\nI'm eating this apple. \ud83c\udfae Let's gooooo!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (0, 3). On the next turn, turn UP to (0, 4) and begin climbing the left wall. I will dominate the left flank and cut off the board.\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019m looking to press the top corridor and keep multiple safe exits open.\n\nSAFE MOVES FROM (8,9):\n- UP -> off board. DEAD. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN -> (8,8) hits our neck. DEAD. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT -> (7,9). SAFE, puts us on the top rail with room to maneuver.\n- RIGHT -> (9,9). SAFE for the moment but locks us into a narrow path along the right edge.\n\nWHY LEFT (7,9) IS THE PLAY:\n- It keeps us on the top edge with two future safe exits (left along the row or drop down if needed).\n- It lines us up to chase apples on the top row (5,9) and (3,9) without closing ourselves in too tight.\n- It avoids giving the opponent an easy chase path through our neck or into a tight corner.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (Turn 7 onward):\n- Turn 7: Move LEFT to (7,9).\n- Turn 8: Move LEFT to (6,9) to creep toward the apple at (5,9).\n- Turn 9: Move LEFT to (5,9) and eat the apple (boost to 5 apples). Stay on the top row and extend the corridor.\n- Turn 10+: From (5,9), consider either continuing LEFT to (4,9) toward (3,9) apple, or DROP DOWN to (5,8) if the board pressure tightens. Maintain at least two safe exits to avoid getting boxed in.\n\nOPPONENT WATCH:\n- Opp head at (1,3) is far; unlikely to disrupt our top-row plan this turn. We\u2019re focusing on growth and edge control to outpace him.\n\nCONTINGENCIES:\n- If the opponent suddenly dives toward the top, we can pivot to the down edge from (7,9) or (6,9) to maintain a corridor and avoid a head-on clash.\n\nFINAL DECISION FOR THIS TURN:\nLEFT",

I need to push my advantage. I am on the left wall. I must move UP to stay relevant in the upper half of the board. If I go DOWN, I isolate myself in the bottom corner, which is bad strategy.

(0,5) is '.' (Empty).\n        *   **DOWN:** (0, 3) - **MY OWN BODY.** (My neck is right there!).\n        *   **LEFT:** (-1, 4) - **WALL.**\n        *   **RIGHT:** (1, 4) - Checking board... (1,4) is '.' (Empty).\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **LEFT:** Off the board. Dead.\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 3) is occupied by my own body. Reversing into yourself is illegal. Dead.\n\n3.  **ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES (UP, RIGHT):**\n    *   **UP (0, 5):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty. Safe.\n        *   *Pros:* Staying on the left wall allows me to climb up towards the apples at (3,7) and (3,9). The enemy is currently at (6,9) heading DOWN/TOWARDS THE CENTER (7,8) or (5,9) (which has an apple). If I go UP, I maintain my vertical distance.\n        *   *Cons:* None immediately.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 4):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty. Safe.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves me away from the wall into open space (x=1). This opens up the center of the board.\n        *   *Cons:* I'm currently heading towards the enemy's last known position (he's dropping down from (6,9)). If I go RIGHT, I might be moving into his path if he swings left.\n\n**STRATEGIC VERDICT:**\nThe enemy (Snake #1) is at (6,9). He has 4 apples to my 3. He just moved DOWN (implied by the context of him \"dropping\" or chasing apples) to (6,8) or similar. The apple at (5,9) is very close to him. I need to be careful not to run into him blindly.\nHowever, if I go RIGHT (1,4), I am moving towards the center. If he stays on the right side, we might box each other in. If I go UP (0,5), I stay on the left wall. This is safer for navigation. The apple at (4,0) is far below, and (5,5) is in the center.\nLet's look at the board again. The enemy was at (6,9). If he goes for the apple at (5,9), he'll be at (5,9). If I go UP to (0,5), I am safe. If I go RIGHT to (1,4), I am safe.\n**Wait, look at the board state provided:**\nBoard row 9: `. . . A . A 1 T T .`\nThe '1' is at (6,9). The 'T's are his tail at (7,9) and (8,9). The apple at (5,9) is RIGHT THERE next to him.\nIf he eats that apple, he might not die, but if he grows, his tail stays.\nIf I go RIGHT (1,4), I am entering the board proper.\n**UP** keeps me safe on the wall. It's the most defensible position. I can see the enemy coming from the right.\nThe apple at (4,0) is tempting but taking me away from the enemy.\nI need to dominate the board. The enemy is top-right. I am top-left.\n**UP** is the move to claim the left flank.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClimb the left wall to y=6. Assess the layout at (3,7). Watch the enemy's movement pattern; if he moves aggressively left, I prepare to cut him off or force a collision (I'm at 3 apples, he's at 4. I need an apple first!).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Row 6 shows `.` at x=0. (0,6) is Empty.\n        *   **DOWN:** (0, 4) - **MY OWN BODY.** (Neck is at (0,4)).\n        *   **LEFT:** (-1, 5) - **WALL.** (Off board).\n        *   **RIGHT:** (1, 5) - Checking board... (1,5) is `.` (Empty).\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **LEFT:** Off the board. Dead.\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 4) is occupied by my own body. Dead.\n\n3.  **ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES (UP, RIGHT):**\n    *   **UP (0, 6):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty. Safe.\n        *   *Path:* Continuing up the left wall.\n        *   *Pros:* Stays on the wall, maintains a safe perimeter. The enemy is at (5,9) and (6,9).\n        *   *Cons:* Limited immediate access to apples on the right side.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 5):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty. Safe.\n        *   *Path:* Moves into the central column (x=1).\n        *   *Pros:* Opens up the board. I can access the apple at (2,6) or move toward the center cluster (4,4), (5,5).\n        *   *Cons:* Moving away from the wall might expose me to the enemy if he swings left.\n\n4.  **Enemy Analysis & Aggression:**\n    *   **Snake #1:** Head (5,9). Body stretches across the top row (6,9) to (8,7).\n    *   **Score:** Enemy has 5 apples, I have 3.\n    *   **Strategy:** I need to catch up. The apple at (2,6) is currently at (2,6) which is `.` (Wait, looking at the board state: Row 6 is `. . A . . . . . . .`. The apple at (2,6) is `A`. Actually, looking closer at the provided board state:\n        Row 6: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n        This means (2,6) is an apple.\n        Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n        (1,7) and (3,7) are apples.\n    *   **The Threat:** If I go UP to (0,6), I am safe but stagnating. If I go RIGHT to (1,5), I am moving toward (2,6) and (1,7).\n    *   **The Trap:** The enemy is top-heavy. If I move RIGHT, I get closer to the center. The enemy has to navigate around his own tail.\n\n5.  **STRATEGIC VERDICT:**\n    *   Going UP keeps me on the wall, but I'm already established there. I need points.\n    *   The apple at (2,6) is very close if I go RIGHT -> (1,6) -> (2,6).\n    *   However, (1,6) is currently `.` (Empty).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (1,5), I leave the wall. This is risky if the enemy decides to slide left, but he has 5 apples to manage and is currently at the top. He likely wants to eat the apple at (4,4) or (5,5).\n    *   **WAIT.** Looking at the board again.\n        Row 5: `0 . . . . . A . . . .`\n        My head is at (0,5).\n        Row 6: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n        Apple at (2,6).\n    *   If I go **UP** to (0,6), I am next to the apple at (2,6) but not grabbing it yet.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (1,5), I am moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n    *   **Aggression Check:** I am behind 3 to 5. I need to eat.\n    *   However, the apple at (4,0) is down low. I am at y=5.\n    *   The apple at (7,2) is also available.\n    *   **Critical Observation:** The board state shows Row 5 has an apple at (5,5).\n    *   Let's look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list in the prompt: `(4, 0), (5, 5), (4, 4), (8, 1), (2, 6), (3, 9), (7, 4), (6, 2), (3, 7), (9, 1), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 0), (1, 7), (5, 8)`.\n    *   The board state visualization might be simplified. I should trust the coordinate list for apple locations.\n    *   Apples I can reach:\n        *   (2,6) - 2 steps away (Right, Up).\n        *   (1,7) - 3 steps away (Right, Up, Up).\n        *   (5,5) - 5 steps away.\n        *   (4,4) - 4 steps away.\n    *   The enemy is at (5,9). He can easily reach (3,9) or (5,8) or (4,4).\n    *   If I stay on the wall (UP), I can snake up to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8) to maybe contest (3,9) later, but that's a long way.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I enter the field.\n    *   **The Play:** I need to secure the apple at (2,6).\n    *   Move 1: RIGHT (1,5).\n    *   Next turn: UP (1,6).\n    *   Next turn: RIGHT (2,6) -> Eat Apple.\n    *   This puts me at (2,6) with +1 score (Total 4).\n    *   Is (1,5) safe? Yes, it's empty.\n    *   Is the enemy moving towards me? Unlikely immediately. He is at y=9, I am at y=5. He is far.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** Moving RIGHT off the wall exposes my flank, but the enemy is occupied. I need the points to catch up.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBreak off the wall immediately to grab the apple at (2,6). Once eaten, I will pivot to the center (4,4) or (5,5) depending on the enemy's position. I need to close the point gap aggressively.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--END OF REPLAY--\n\nRIGHT",

Row 6 shows `. . A . . . . . . .`. (1,6) is Empty.\n        *   **DOWN:** (1, 4) - Checking board... Row 4 shows `T . . . A . . A . .`. (1,4) is Empty.\n        *   **LEFT:** (0, 5) - **MY OWN BODY.** (0,5) is my neck/tail.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (2, 5) - Checking board... Row 5 shows `T 0 . . . A . . . .`. (2,5) is Empty.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 5) is occupied by my body. Dead.\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 4) is Empty. Safe.\n    *   **UP:** (1, 6) is Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 5) is Empty. Safe.\n\n3.  **ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n    *   **UP (1, 6):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves me directly toward the apple at (2,6). Sets up a potential route to the apple at (1,7).\n        *   *Cons:* None immediately obvious.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 4):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Brings me closer to the apple at (4,4) and (4,0).\n        *   *Cons:* Moving down away from the enemy who is at the top (y=9). I need to close the gap, not increase it.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 5):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves me toward the center.\n        *   *Cons:* (2,5) is a bit of a \"dead\" lane compared to (1,6). From (2,5), I can only go Up (2,6) to get the apple, or Down/Right. From (1,6), I have better angles.\n\n4.  **Enemy Analysis & Aggression:**\n    *   **Snake #1:** Head (5,9). Body blocks the top right. He is effectively camping the top row.\n    *   **Score:** Enemy 6, Me 3. I am behind by 3 points.\n    *   **Strategy:** I am currently at x=1. The apple at (2,6) is my best immediate target. It's only 1 step away (Up) from where I will be if I move Up to (1,6).\n    *   If I go **UP** to (1,6):\n        *   Next turn I can go **RIGHT** to (2,6) and eat the apple.\n        *   This puts me at 4 apples.\n    *   If I go **DOWN** to (1,4):\n        *   I am moving away from the cluster of apples at (2,6), (1,7), (3,7).\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (2,5):\n        *   I am not grabbing the apple immediately. I'm adjacent to (2,6) but not directly below it. It's a less direct path.\n\n5.  **STRATEGIC VERDICT:**\n    *   **The Move:** **UP**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The apple at (2,6) is the closest apple to me (2 moves away: Up -> Right). By moving Up to (1,6), I position myself perfectly to snag it on the following turn.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** The enemy is at (5,9). He cannot reach me this turn. He is top-heavy and slow. The path Up is clear. (1,6) is empty. (0,6) is empty (if I need to retreat to the wall later).\n    *   **Psychology:** I need to eat to catch up. Sitting on the wall doing nothing is a slow death. I need to aggressively pursue that apple at (2,6) to get back in the race.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (2,6) ASAP (Next turn: RIGHT). Once eaten, I'll be at 4 apples. From (2,6), I can look at (1,7) or pivot toward the center apples (4,4), (5,5) while keeping an eye on the enemy's movement. I need to bridge the 3-point gap.\n\nUP",

Opponent Snake #0 is over at (1,5) with body [(0,5), (0,4), (0,3)]. Apples are spawning, but we\u2019re focusing on the enemy and space control.\n\nSAFE MOVES RIGHT NOW:\n- UP: DEAD (hits neck at (5,9))\n- DOWN: SAFE (to (5,7))\n- LEFT: SAFE (to (4,8))\n- RIGHT: SAFE (to (6,8))\n\nCURRENTALLY AGGRESSIVE AND SMART MOVE:\n- RIGHT to (6,8) is the clear pick. It keeps us in open space, increases our control toward the center-right, and preserves multiple future options. We\u2019re ahead on apples, so staying expansive helps trap and pressure without diving into dangerous dead-ends near the top edge.\n\nREASONING:\n- UP is off-limits (hits our neck).\n- LEFT would start hugging the top-left quadrant but slows our tempo and gives him room to maneuver on the left.\n- RIGHT keeps us dominant in the center, where we can menace his path and set up quick pivots to close in if he tries to swing toward the middle.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns):\n- Maintain aggressive pressure while extending a safe path toward the center. If he edges toward our side, be prepared to pivot to cut him off and force near-collision opportunities.\n- Watch for a head-on chance if he commits to a shared cell; with 6 apples vs 3, we\u2019ll take the trade when it nets us a win.\n- Use the eastward push to funnel space and prevent him from slipping into our backfield.\n\nPLAN FOR TURN 11 AND BEYOND:\n- Turn 11: Move RIGHT to (6,8) (this turn\u2019s action).\n- Turn 12: If safe, continue RIGHT to (7,8); else DOWN to (6,7) to pressure center and keep options open.\n- Turn 13+: Create a shallow arc along the 7\u20138 rows to pinch his options, while chasing apples in reachable zigzags and maintaining a widening buffer from his head.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's look at the apple list: (1,7) IS in the apple list. Let me re-check the board map. The map provided is:\n            9 . A . A . T T T T .\n            8 . . . . . T 1 . T .\n            7 .

A . . . . . .`\n            Indices: 0: ., 1: A? No, (1,7) is index 1. Let's look at the Apple List again: (1,7) is listed. But the map says (1,7) is empty? Let's look at the map again. Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n            Index 0: .\n            Index 1: (1,7) is A? No, that's (1,7)? No, map coordinates: x is column, y is row.\n            Row 7: `. A .

Let's check the provided map closely.\n            Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n            This suggests (1,7) is 'A' and (3,7) is 'A'.\n            **Correction:** The apple list includes (1,7). The map shows an 'A' at (1,7) in Row 7.\n            So UP to (1,7) is an APPLE.\n        *   **DOWN:** (1, 5) - **MY OWN BODY.** (1,5) is my neck.\n        *   **LEFT:** (0, 6) - Checking board...

(2,6) is 'A' (Apple).\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 5) is occupied by my body. Dead.\n    *   **UP:** (1, 7) is Empty (or Apple).

This is the best move.\n    *   **UP (1, 7):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty (Apple is actually at (1,7)? Map shows 'A' at (1,7). Let's double check the apple list. Apple list: (1,7). Okay, so UP is also an apple.\n        *   Wait, let's look at the map again.\n            Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n            If x=1 is 'A', then UP is an apple.\n            However, the apple at (2,6) is right next to me.\n        *   *Pros:* Also an apple.\n        *   *Cons:* (1,7) is \"T\" territory? No, looking at the map, (1,7) is an 'A'. The enemy is at (6,8). (1,7) is closer to the top edge.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 6):**\n        *   *Status:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Safe retreat to wall.\n        *   *Cons:* No apple. Moves away from the target.\n\n4.  **Enemy Analysis & Aggression:**\n    *   **Snake #1:** Head (6, 8). Body at (5,8) etc.\n    *   **Score:** Enemy 6, Me 3.\n    *   **Strategy:** I need to eat. I have two apples adjacent: (2,6) and (1,7).\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   Enemy is at (6,8).\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (2,6), I am at (2,6). Next turn I can look for apples at (3,7), (4,4), etc.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (1,7), I am at (1,7). Next turn I could go (2,7) or (1,8) or (0,7).\n        *   Which is safer? (2,6) is slightly more central. (1,7) is very close to the top wall (y=9).\n        *   Enemy is at y=8. If I go to (1,7), I am at y=7. If enemy moves aggressive (e.g., towards me), I might get pinned against the top wall.\n        *   (2,6) gives me more vertical room (y=6).\n        *   Also, looking at the map, (2,6) is directly next to my current spot. (1,7) is diagonal? No, UP is (1,7).\n        *   Let's look at the board state.\n            6 . 0 A . . . . . .  (Current head at 1,6. Apple at 2,6. Apple at 1,7? Map Row 7 says (1,7) is 'A'?)\n            Wait, looking at the map provided:\n            Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n            This row corresponds to y=7.\n            x=0: .\n            x=1: A\n            x=2: .\n            x=3: A\n            So (1,7) is an apple. (3,7) is an apple.\n            Current pos: (1,6).\n            Move UP -> (1,7) (Apple).\n            Move RIGHT -> (2,6) (Apple).\n            Move LEFT -> (0,6) (Empty).\n            \n            Which is better?\n            (1,7) is at y=7. Top wall is y=9.\n            (2,6) is at y=6. More space below.\n            Enemy is at y=8.\n            If I go UP to (1,7), I am moving TOWARDS the enemy (y increases). He is at y=8. I'd be at y=7.\n            If I go RIGHT to (2,6), I am at y=6. I am moving AWAY from him vertically, but moving horizontally towards the center where he might be.\n            \n            Let's look at the gap. Enemy is at x=6. I am at x=1.\n            Going RIGHT puts me closer to his x-coordinate (x=2 vs x=1).\n            Going UP puts me closer to his y-coordinate (y=7 vs y=6).\n            \n            However, eating is priority. I need the points.\n            \n            If I go UP to (1,7):\n            I eat the apple. Head at (1,7).\n            Next turn, options: (2,7), (1,8), (0,7), (1,6 - tail).\n            (1,8) is dangerous because enemy might be coming down. (2,7) is empty? Map shows (2,7) is empty.\n            \n            If I go RIGHT to (2,6):\n            I eat the apple. Head at (2,6).\n            Next turn, options: (3,6), (2,7), (1,6 - tail), (2,5).\n            (2,5) is empty? Map shows (2,5) is empty (Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .` -> x=2 is '.').\n            (3,6) is empty.\n            \n            Strategic choice:\n            (1,7) is a \"corner\" of sorts (close to top left). (2,6) is more open.\n            Actually, looking at the map, (0,7) is empty, (1,7) is apple, (2,7) is empty, (3,7) is apple.\n            The top row (y=9) is blocked by enemy tail/trees.\n            y=8 has enemy head at (6,8) and tail pieces.\n            \n            If I go UP to (1,7), I am at y=7.\n            If I go RIGHT to (2,6), I am at y=6.\n            \n            The enemy is at (6,8). They are moving simultaneously.\n            If the enemy moves DOWN (to 6,7), they get closer.\n            If I go UP (1,7), distance to enemy head is |6-1| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n            If I go RIGHT (2,6), distance to enemy head is |6-2| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n            Distance is same.\n            \n            However, (1,7) is closer to the wall. If the enemy decides to chase me into the corner, (1,7) is a trap. (2,6) allows me to drop down to (2,5) or move to (3,6).\n            \n            Let's look at the apples again.\n            (2,6) is right there.\n            (1,7) is right there.\n            \n            Is there a threat?\n            Enemy tail at (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8).\n            Enemy body at (5,8).\n            Enemy head at (6,8).\n            \n            If I go UP to (1,7), I am safe from immediate collision.\n            If I go RIGHT to (2,6), I am safe.\n            \n            Let's look at the \"boxing in\" strategy.\n            I need to dominate the board. (2,6) feels more dominant in the center-left. (1,7) feels like hugging the wall.\n            Also, if I eat at (2,6), I am at 4 apples. 2 behind the enemy (6).\n            If I eat at (1,7), I am at 4 apples.\n            \n            Let's check if (1,7) is blocked.\n            Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`\n            (1,7) is 'A'.\n            \n            Wait, looking at the map again.\n            Row 6: `. 0 A . . . . . . .` (Head at 1,6, Apple at 2,6)\n            Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .` (Apple at 1,7, Apple at 3,7)\n            \n            If I go UP to (1,7), I take the apple.\n            Next turn, I could go RIGHT to (2,7). (2,7) is empty.\n            Or I could go UP to (1,8). (1,8) is empty (Map row 8: `. . . . . T 1 . T .` -> (1,8) is '.').\n            But (1,8) is very close to enemy territory.\n            \n            If I go RIGHT to (2,6), I take the apple.\n            Next turn, I could go UP to (2,7). (2,7) is empty.\n            Or I could go RIGHT to (3,6). (3,6) is empty.\n            \n            (2,6) seems to offer better future mobility.\n            Also, (2,6) is directly to the RIGHT.\n            \n            **CRITICAL CHECK:** Head-on collision?\n            Enemy is at (6,8). They move simultaneously.\n            If they move DOWN-LEFT, they could hit me? No, they are far.\n            \n            **The Play:**\n            Eat the apple. Grow.\n            Which apple is safer?\n            (2,6) is at y=6.\n            (1,7) is at y=7.\n            The enemy is at y=8.\n            Moving to y=7 brings me closer to the enemy's vertical level.\n            Moving to y=6 keeps me slightly below his vertical range.\n            (2,6) is also closer to the center of the board (x=5).\n            \n            Let's go **RIGHT** to (2,6). It's a solid, central move that grabs an apple and keeps me away from the top edge where the enemy is lurking.\n\n4.  **STRATEGIC VERDICT:**\n    *   **The Move:** **RIGHT**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** I need to eat to catch up (3 apples vs 6). The apple at (2,6) is directly to my right. Moving there grows my snake and puts me at 4 apples. (2,6) is safer than (1,7) because it is slightly further from the enemy's current position (y=6 vs y=7) and offers more central mobility for future turns. I will eat the apple, block that space from the enemy, and prepare to move towards the next cluster of apples at (3,7) or (4,4) depending on the enemy's move.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2,6). After eating, I will be at (2,6) with 4 apples. Next turn, assess if I should go UP to (2,7) to threaten the apple at (3,7) or if I should move sideways to (3,6) to maintain distance from the enemy. The goal is to reach 5 apples and close the gap to 1.\n\nRIGHT",

We are trailing Snake #1 (6 apples to our 4), and we need to make a move that keeps us alive and keeps us hunting. Let's break down the grid!\n\n**1. ANALYZING THE CURRENT STATE**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 6)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4)]\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 at (7, 8) with 6 apples. They are camping in the top-right quadrant.\n*   **The Board:** I see apples everywhere, but we gotta watch our step.\n\n**2. CHECKING THE MOVES**\n*   **Current Head (2, 6)**\n*   **UP to (2, 7):**\n    *   Board shows: (2, 7) is empty (Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .`).\n    *   This is an empty space.\n    *   *Safety Check:* Is it safe long-term? (2, 7) is getting closer to the top wall (y=9) and closer to the enemy's vertical territory. It's not ideal, but it's empty.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 5):**\n    *   Board shows: (2, 5) is empty (Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .` -> x=2 is '.').\n    *   This is an empty space.\n    *   *Safety Check:* This moves me *away* from the enemy (who is at y=8) and down into the center/open area. This feels safer vertically.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):**\n    *   This is my body (the segment right behind my head). **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Board shows: (3, 6) is empty (Row 6: `. 0 A . . . . . . .` -> x=3 is '.').\n    *   This is an empty space.\n    *   *Safety Check:* This moves me horizontally towards the center. However, (3, 6) is directly East of my current position.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS**\nI need to eat to catch up, but I can't just rush blindly. The enemy is at (7, 8). If I move **UP** to (2, 7), I'm exposing myself to the top edge. If I move **RIGHT** to (3, 6), I'm moving towards the center where the enemy might sweep down.\n\nHowever, look at the apples.\n*   (2, 6) was the apple. I ate it last turn (Wait, did I eat it? Let's check the turn history. The user said \"Turn: 13\". The previous move was \"RIGHT\". My previous head was (1,6). Moving RIGHT goes to (2,6).\n    *   **Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:**\n    *   Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n    *   Wait, looking at the prompt's board state carefully:\n    *   Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n    *   This means (1,6) is 'T' (Tail?) and (2,6) is '0' (Head).\n    *   **BUT**, looking at the Apple List provided in the prompt: `(6, 2), (3, 7), (9, 1), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9), (5, 7)`.\n    *   **Wait, the board state shows `A` at specific spots.**\n    *   Row 7: `. A . A . . . . . .` -> (1,7) is A, (3,7) is A.\n    *   Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .` -> (2,6) is my head. (1,6) is my body.\n    *   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** The apple at (2,6) is NOT on the board map. The apples are at (1,7) and (3,7) near me.\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt says \"Turn: 13\". The previous move was \"RIGHT\". My head moved from (1,6) to (2,6).\n    *   **Did I eat an apple?**\n        *   Previous Rationale said: \"We just moved UP to (1,6) ... face-to-face with the apple at (2,6).\" -> Wait, that was Turn 12. Turn 12 move was RIGHT (from 1,6 to 2,6).\n        *   The prompt says \"Turn: 13\". The board state shows `0` at (2,6).\n        *   **Let's check the board state again.**\n        *   Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n        *   Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .`\n        *   Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .`\n        *   There is NO apple at (2,6) on the board.\n        *   **Wait, where did the apple at (2,6) go?**\n        *   The prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: (4, 0), (5, 5), (4, 4), (8, 1), (3, 9), (7, 4), (6, 2), (3, 7), (9, 1), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9), (5, 7)\".\n        *   Is (2,6) in that list? **NO.**\n        *   So, the \"apple at (2,6)\" mentioned in the \"LAST RATIONALE\" (which was a summary of a hypothetical previous turn, likely Turn 12) must have been eaten or wasn't actually there?\n        *   *Let's re-read the prompt's \"LAST RATIONALE\" carefully.*\n        *   It says: \"We just moved UP to (1,6), and now we're face-to-face with the apple at (2,6).\"\n        *   But the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says \"RIGHT\".\n        *   So on Turn 12, I moved RIGHT from (1,6) to (2,6).\n        *   **If I moved to (2,6) and it was an apple, I should have grown.**\n        *   The prompt says \"Turn: 13\".\n        *   My body is listed as: `[(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4)]`.\n        *   My head is `(2, 6)`.\n        *   **Wait.** If I ate an apple at (2,6) on Turn 12, my tail would *not* have moved (growth). My body would be `[(1,6), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3)?]` or similar. But the length is fixed.\n        *   Let's look at the Board State provided in the prompt again.\n        *   Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n        *   (1,6) is marked 'T' (Tail?).\n        *   (2,6) is marked '0' (Head).\n        *   **IF I ate an apple, the tail (1,6) would stay because I grew.**\n        *   **BUT** the list of apples in the prompt does NOT include (2,6).\n        *   **Conclusion:** I moved to (2,6) on Turn 12, but it was **NOT** an apple. The \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt was slightly misleading or I misread the board state in the previous turn (which was part of the prompt's history).\n        *   **Current Status:** I am at (2,6). There is no apple here. I need to find an apple.\n\n**4. WHERE ARE THE APPLES?**\nLooking at the board state and the apple list:\n*   **(1, 7):** On Row 7 (`. A . A . . . . . .`). This is UP from me (2,6)? No, UP is (2,7). (1,7) is UP-LEFT (diagonal). **Invalid move.**\n*   **(3, 7):** On Row 7. This is UP-RIGHT (diagonal). **Invalid move.**\n*   **(4, 4):** On Row 4. This is DOWN-RIGHT.\n*   **(5, 5):** On Row 5. This is DOWN-RIGHT.\n*   **(6, 2):** On Row 2. Far away.\n*   **(7, 4):** On Row 4. Far away.\n\n**MOVES:**\n*   **UP to (2, 7):** Empty (Row 7). Safe. Brings me closer to apples at (1,7) and (3,7) (though diagonals, need to loop).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 5):** Empty (Row 5). Safe. Moves towards apples at (4,4) and (5,5).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):** **MY BODY.** Death.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Empty (Row 6). Safe. Moves towards (4,4) and (5,5).\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 is at (7,8). They are top-right.\nIf I go **UP (2,7)**, I get closer to the top wall (y=9) and the enemy territory. This is risky if the enemy comes down.\nIf I go **DOWN (2,5)**, I go central/bottom. This gives me more space to maneuver and hunt the apples at (4,4), (5,5), etc.\nIf I go **RIGHT (3,6)**, I go central. Also good.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to eat. I am at 4 apples, enemy at 6.\nI want to move towards the cluster of apples in the lower center/right.\n**UP** moves me towards the top wall where movement is restricted. Avoid.\n**DOWN** moves me away from the enemy and towards the open board and lower apples.\n**RIGHT** moves me horizontally towards the center.\n\n**DOWN** seems the safest and most strategic to open up the board and avoid getting pinned against the top wall by the enemy. From (2,5), I can access (3,5), (2,4), etc., hunting the apples at (4,4) and (5,5).\n\n**CHECKING FOR TRAPS:**\nIf I go DOWN to (2,5):\n*   Next turn, I can go DOWN-LEFT to (2,4) or DOWN-RIGHT to (3,5) or RIGHT to (3,5).\n*   (2,4) is empty (Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` -> x=2 is '.').\n*   (3,5) is empty (Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .` -> x=3 is '.').\n*   (4,5) has an apple (5,5)? No, (5,5) is the apple. (4,5) is empty.\n*   This direction seems open.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,7):\n*   I hit y=7. Top is y=9.\n*   Enemy is at y=8.\n*   If I go UP, I am putting myself directly below the enemy's y-level (if he moves down). He is at (7,8). If he moves DOWN, he goes to (7,7).\n*   I would be at (2,7).\n*   The distance is large, but cutting off my own escape route to the bottom is bad.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**DOWN** is the play. It keeps me safe from the top wall, moves towards the enemy's territory (eventually) but from a safer angle, and heads towards the apples in the lower half of the board.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (2,5). From there, I will look to secure the apples at (4,4) or (5,5) next turn. I need to close the score gap!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the grid and plan the takedown!\n\n**1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 5)\n*   **My Body:** [(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 at (7, 7) (Head), Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]\n*   **Score:** Me 4, Enemy 6. (Gap: -2)\n\n**2. EVALUATING MY MOVES FROM (2, 5)**\n*   **UP to (2, 6):** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** My body is right there at (2, 6). \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4):** Safe. (Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` -> x=2 is '.'). This is open space.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** My body is right there at (1, 5). \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Safe. (Row 5: `. . . . . A . . . .` -> x=3 is '.'). Open space.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN**\nI have two safe moves: **DOWN (2, 4)** and **RIGHT (3, 5)**. Both are empty.\n\n**Analyzing DOWN to (2, 4):**\n*   **Pros:** Moves me closer to the apple at (4, 4). Opens up the bottom half of the board. Keeps me away from the enemy who is currently at y=7.\n*   **Cons:** If I go DOWN, I'm entering the \"T\" zone (Row 4 starts with T). Looking at the board state, Row 4 has `(0,4)` and `(1,4)`? No, wait.\n    *   Board Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .`\n    *   (0,4) is 'T'. (1,4) is '.'.\n    *   (2,4) is '.'.\n    *   (3,4) is '.'.\n    *   (4,4) is 'A' (Apple!).\n*   **Future:** From (2,4), I can go RIGHT to (3,4) or UP to (2,5) (safe, as my tail will move). My tail is currently at (0,5). By the time I move, my tail will vacate (0,5) and move to (0,4)? No, my body is `[(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]`.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2,4), my new body will be `[(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]`. The tail (0,5) is gone.\n    *   Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n    *   Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .` (x=0 is T, x=1 is T).\n    *   Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` (x=0 is T).\n    *   My body is `[(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]`.\n    *   (0,5) is 'T'. (1,5) is 'T'.\n    *   (2,5) is '0' (Head).\n    *   (1,6) is 'T'. (2,6) is 'T'.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2,4):\n        *   New Head: (2,4).\n        *   New Body: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)].\n        *   The cell (0,5) becomes empty.\n        *   The cell (0,4) is 'T' (from Row 4). Is that *my* tail?\n            *   My previous tail was (0,5).\n            *   My body is `[(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]`.\n            *   Wait, the board state shows `(0,5)` as T. It also shows `(0,4)` as T.\n            *   Looking at the board state carefully:\n            *   Row 5: `T T . . . A . . . .` -> (0,5) and (1,5) are T.\n            *   Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` -> (0,4) is T.\n            *   Is (0,4) part of my body?\n            *   The prompt lists my body as `[(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]`.\n            *   So `(0,4)` is NOT my body? Or is the board state slightly misaligned with the list?\n            *   Let's trust the **LIST** for my body.\n            *   My body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (2,4), my tail (0,5) moves off (to where? It just disappears).\n            *   (0,4) is marked 'T' on the board. If that 'T' is *not* me, it's a ghost or an error, but I must assume the board is accurate.\n            *   Wait, `Row 4: T . . .` usually implies the snake body starts there.\n            *   If (0,4) is 'T' and (0,5) is 'T', and my list says my tail is (0,5), then (0,4) is likely **not** mine (unless the list is head-to-tail and missing a link? No, length is 5).\n            *   **CRITICAL:** If (0,4) is an obstacle (another part of me or a glitch), then (1,4) is safe.\n            *   **Scenario:**\n                *   Head: (2,5).\n                *   Move DOWN to (2,4).\n                *   (2,4) is '.' (Empty).\n                *   (1,4) is '.'.\n                *   (0,4) is 'T'.\n                *   Since my body list is `[(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]`, my tail (0,5) will move. (0,4) might be an old tail or a wall.\n                *   If (0,4) is my tail, it's fine. If it's an obstacle, it's not adjacent to my head.\n                *   **The Real Threat:** Moving DOWN brings me to (2,4). From there, (3,4) is safe. (4,4) is an apple.\n\n**Analyzing RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n*   **Pros:** Moves me closer to the apple at (5,5) and (4,4). Opens up the center.\n*   **Cons:** Brings me slightly closer to the enemy's potential path (he is at (7,7), but can move down to y=6).\n*   **Future:** From (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4) (which connects to (4,4) apple).\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI need to eat. The closest apples are at (4,4) and (5,5).\nFrom (2,5):\n*   **DOWN (2,4)** -> Next move: (3,4) -> (4,4) (Apple). (Distance: 2 moves).\n*   **RIGHT (3,5)** -> Next move: (4,5) -> (4,4) (Apple). (Distance: 2 moves).\n\nBoth lead to the apple in 2 moves.\nHowever, **DOWN** seems slightly safer regarding the board edges and open space.\nLet's look at the enemy again. He is at (7,7).\nHe has apples at (7,4) and (6,2) nearby? No, looking at Row 7: `. A . A . . . 1 . .` -> (1,7) and (3,7) are apples.\nHe is at (7,7). He will likely chase the apples in his quadrant.\nI am at (2,5). If I go **DOWN**, I am moving away from him and consolidating the bottom left/center.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am moving towards the center line.\n\n**CHECKING FOR TRAPS:**\n*   **DOWN (2,4):**\n    *   Adjacent cells: (1,4) [Safe? Board says '.'. My body isn't there.], (3,4) [Safe], (2,5) [Safe, I just left it], (2,3) [Safe? Yes].\n    *   Is (0,4) a problem? My body is at (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6).\n    *   (0,4) is 'T'. If it's my tail, it will move as I move.\n    *   **WAIT.** If (0,4) is 'T' and (0,5) is 'T', and my list is `[(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5)]`, then (0,4) is likely just visual artifact or a stuck tail?\n    *   Let's assume standard mechanics. As I move DOWN, my tail (0,5) moves to (0,4). The existing 'T' at (0,4) is probably just where my tail *is* (or will be). It's safe.\n    *   So (2,4) is a safe empty space.\n\n*   **RIGHT (3,5):**\n    *   Adjacent cells: (2,5) [Safe], (4,5) [Safe], (3,4) [Safe], (3,6) [Safe].\n    *   (3,5) is clear.\n\n**AGGRESSION & SCORE:**\nEnemy is at 6 apples. I am at 4.\nI need to eat ASAP.\nApple at (4,4) is reachable.\nApple at (5,5) is reachable.\nApple at (1,7) and (3,7) are near the enemy (y=7).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nGo **DOWN**.\nWhy? It puts me in a position where I can pivot to (4,4) or (3,5) or (2,3) next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,5), I am on the same y-level as the enemy's potential path (y=7 vs y=5 is different, but center is dangerous).\nGoing DOWN (y=4) puts me lower. The enemy is high (y=7). This separation is good. It allows me to claim the lower half of the board.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove **DOWN** to (2,4). From there, on Turn 15, I will move **RIGHT** to (3,4). On Turn 16, I will move **RIGHT** to (4,4) to eat the apple. This closes the gap.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps a clean central corridor, lines us up to reach the apple at (7,4) in a couple moves, and preserves multiple escape routes. It also avoids pinning us near the enemy\u2019s side so we can force later head-ons if we gain more apples.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Stay expansive and deny the rival easy funnels.\n- Move toward edges only when it helps trap him without sacrificing safety.\n- Use apples to grow length and extend reach, prioritizing survival and future options over risky chases.\n- If the rival overcommits into our lane and we have the higher apples, look for a controlled head-on to cement the win.\n\nDOWN",

Just open space.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 4):** **SAFE.**\n    *   Board Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` -> (1,4) is '.'.\n    *   My body is at (1,5) and (1,6). (1,4) is empty.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** **SAFE.**\n    *   Board Row 4: `T . . . A . . A . .` -> (3,4) is '.'.\n    *   (4,4) is the apple. (3,4) is the gateway.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\n**OPTION A: DOWN to (2, 3)**\n*   *Pros:* Opens up the bottom edge (y=3, y=2). Moves toward apples at (6,2) and (7,0).\n*   *Cons:* Moves *away* from the immediate high-value target at (4,4). The enemy is at (7,6). If I go down to y=3, and he stays high or goes center, I lose the race to (4,4). I need points *now* to catch up.\n\n**OPTION B: LEFT to (1, 4)**\n*   *Pros:* Safe. Hugs the left wall.\n*   *Cons:* (1,4) is just a transit cell. It doesn't get me closer to (4,4) effectively. It keeps me on the edge, which limits my options. I want to dominate the center.\n\n**OPTION C: RIGHT to (3, 4)**\n*   *Pros:* **This is the winning move.**\n    *   **Apple Hunting:** I am now exactly 1 step away from the apple at (4,4). Next turn, I eat.\n    *   **Center Control:** I am entering the main arena. From (3,4), I can pivot to (3,3), (3,5), (4,4), or (2,4) (tail moves).\n    *   **Enemy Positioning:** Enemy is at (7,6). He is far right. He is looking at apples at (7,4) or (6,2) or (5,5)? Wait, (5,5) is an apple.\n    *   **The Trap:** By moving RIGHT to (3,4), I am cutting off the center. If the enemy wants to come to the center, he has to cross my path.\n    *   **Safety:** (3,4) is empty. My tail is at (1,5). As I move to (3,4), my tail moves to (2,5) (the cell I'm currently in). So (2,5) will be empty for the *next* turn. (2,4) (my current pos) will be empty.\n    *   **Visualizing the Board:**\n        *   (4,4) is Apple.\n        *   (3,4) is where I am going.\n        *   (2,4) will be my body (old head).\n        *   (1,4) remains empty (or potential space).\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy is at (7,6). He might move DOWN to (7,5) or LEFT to (6,6).\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (6,6), he is still far. If he moves DOWN to (7,5), he goes toward (7,4) apple.\n    *   I am securing the left/center flank.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nI need that apple at (4,4). Moving RIGHT sets me up perfectly to eat it on Turn 16. It keeps me in the game for points. Moving DOWN or LEFT stalls. In a game of catch-up, stalling is losing.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (3,4) now. On Turn 16, move RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple and grow to 5. Then, use that extra body length to wall off the center or chase the enemy depending on his position. I must close the score gap!\n\nRIGHT",

Now, we need to execute the grab and keep the pressure on Snake #1. He's got 6 apples, we've got 4\u2014we need to eat!\n\n**TURN 16 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**1. CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 4) (Moved RIGHT from (2, 4) last turn).\n*   **My Body:** [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6)] (Tail at (1, 6)). *Correction based on last move logic: Previous body was [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] with head (2,4). Moving RIGHT to (3,4) shifts body to [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)].*\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 5) (Moved DOWN from (7, 6) last turn).\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9)].\n*   **Target:** The delicious apple at (4, 4) is right next to me!\n\n**2. SURVIVAL CHECK (MOVES FROM (3, 4)):**\n*   **UP to (3, 5):** **CHECK CAREFULLY.**\n    *   Board Row 5: `. . T . . A . 1 . .` -> (3, 5) is 'T' (My own body segment at (3,5)?).\n    *   Wait, looking at my body `[(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]`.\n    *   (3, 5) is empty on the board map provided (` . . T . . A . 1 . .` indices: 0:., 1:., 2:T, 3:., 4:., 5:A...). Wait, the map shows `T` at index 2. That's x=2.\n    *   Let's look at the board state provided again:\n        `9 . A . A . T . . .`\n        `8 . . . . . T T T . .`\n        `7 . A . A . A . T . .`\n        `6 . T T . . . . T . .`\n        `5 . . T . . A . 1 . .`\n        `4 . . T 0 A . . A . .`\n    *   My body occupies: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6).\n    *   Target (3,5): Is it occupied?\n        *   Row 5: `. . T . . A . 1 . .`\n        *   x=0: `.`\n        *   x=1: `.`\n        *   x=2: `T` (My body at 2,5)\n        *   x=3: `.` (Empty!)\n        *   x=4: `.`\n        *   x=5: `A`\n    *   So (3,5) is SAFE from my own body. Is it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (7,5). He is far. Safe.\n    *   **WAIT!** Did I miss something? My head is at (3,4). My body is at (2,4) (old head).\n    *   If I go UP to (3,5), is (3,5) occupied?\n        *   Looking at the board string for row 5: `. . T . . A . 1 . .`\n        *   This string length is 10. Indices 0-9.\n        *   Index 0: `.`\n        *   Index 1: `.`\n        *   Index 2: `T` (x=2)\n        *   Index 3: `.` (x=3)\n        *   Index 4: `.` (x=4)\n        *   Index 5: `A` (x=5)\n        *   Index 6: `.` (x=6)\n        *   Index 7: `1` (x=7, enemy head)\n        *   Index 8: `.` (x=8)\n        *   Index 9: `.` (x=9)\n        *   So (3,5) is indeed '.'.\n    *   **UP is SAFE.**\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 3):** **SAFE.**\n    *   Row 3 is completely empty (`. . . . . . . . . .`).\n    *   No threats.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 4):** **DEATH.**\n    *   My body is currently at (2, 4).

A . .` -> Wait, that's the CURRENT board state.\n    *   The target is (4,4). The board shows `A` there.\n    *   Is it safe?\n    *   (4,4) is the apple. Moving here eats it.\n    *   Is (4,4) occupied by my body? No. My body is at (2,4), (2,5), etc.\n    *   Is (4,4) occupied by enemy body? No, enemy is at x=7.\n    *   **RIGHT is SAFE and GROWS ME.**\n\n**3. STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\n**OPTION A: UP to (3, 5)**\n*   *Pros:* Safe. Opens up the top area. Moves towards apple at (5,5).\n*   *Cons:* **I MISS THE APPLE AT (4,4).** I am currently adjacent to a guaranteed point. Passing it up is a massive tactical error when I'm trailing by 2 points. I need to close the gap *now*.\n\n**OPTION B: DOWN to (3, 3)**\n*   *Pros:* Safe.\n*   *Cons:* Moves away from the apple. Similar to Option A, I lose the immediate point opportunity. I need to be aggressive.\n\n**OPTION C: RIGHT to (4, 4)**\n*   **THE WINNING MOVE.**\n*   **Apple Consumption:** I eat the apple at (4,4). My score becomes 5. The gap narrows to 6 vs 5. This is critical.\n*   **Body Growth:** My tail won't move this turn (since I ate). This gives me a longer body, which I can use to block paths or create walls.\n*   **Positioning:** I land in the absolute center of the board (4,4). From here, I have access to almost all quadrants.\n    *   Up: (4,5)\n    *   Down: (4,3)\n    *   Left: (3,4) (my previous spot, now empty as my tail moves to (2,4)? Wait, if I eat, tail stays. So (2,4) stays occupied. (3,4) becomes empty? No. Head moves from (3,4) to (4,4). Body becomes [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)].\n    *   Wait, if I eat, I grow. Length becomes 6.\n    *   New Body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6).\n    *   Old Tail (1,6) stays.\n    *   This creates a nice vertical block at x=2 and x=3 in the lower half.\n*   **Enemy Threat Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy is at (7,5). He likely wants to go for the apple at (7,4) or (6,2).\n    *   If he goes for (7,4), he moves DOWN.\n    *   If he goes for (6,2), he moves LEFT and DOWN.\n    *   He is far away. Collision is unlikely this turn unless he dashes diagonally.\n    *   Head-on collision check: He is at (7,5). If he moves LEFT to (6,5), and I move RIGHT to (4,4), no collision.\n    *   Even if he moves to (7,4) and I move to (4,4), no collision.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nTaking the apple is non-negotiable. I am in range, it's safe, and I need the points to stay competitive. The \"Grow as a means of dominating the board\" rule applies perfectly here. A longer snake is a stronger snake.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (4,4) to score 5. Once grown, I will have a body length of 6. I need to use this extra length to cut off the center of the map. My next move after eating will likely be UP towards (4,5) or LEFT to reposition, depending on where the enemy heads. I must maintain pressure and force him into a corner.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We just secured the apple at (4,4) by moving RIGHT last turn, putting our head at (4,4) and growing to length 6. Now we need to keep the momentum going!\n\n**TURN 17 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Post-Move):**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 4) (Just moved RIGHT and ate!)\n*   **My Body:** [(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6)] (Tail at (1, 6), didn't move because we ate).\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 4) (He likely moved DOWN to eat the apple at (7, 4) or is just repositioning. He had 7 apples, if he ate, he's at 8).\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9)].\n*   **Enemy Score:** Likely 8 now (up from 7). **CRITICAL:** We are trailing by 3 points.\n\n**THE BOARD & SURVIVAL CHECK (From (4, 4)):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** My *previous* body position (old head location). \n    *   **Risk:** High. Since I just moved from (3,4) to (4,4), the cell (3,4) is occupied by my body segment.\n    *   **Result:** Moving LEFT puts my head directly into my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Target:** Row 3 is completely empty (`. . . . . . . . . .`).\n    *   **Risk:** None. Safe from my body.\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is at x=7, y=4. He is nowhere near (4,3). Safe.\n    *   **Future:** Opens up the bottom area. However, there's a potential apple at (6,2) or (4,0), but it's a bit far and leaves the center.\n\n3.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** Row 5 (`. . T . . A . 1 . .`).\n    *   **Coordinates:**\n        *   x=0: `.`\n        *   x=1: `.`\n        *   x=2: `T` (My body at 2,5)\n        *   x=3: `.` (My body moved from 3,4 to 4,4, so 3,4 is now part of my body, but 3,5 is empty? Wait, my body is at (3,4) now. Row 5 shows `T` at x=2.

If he moves UP to (7,5), he hits his own body (segment at 7,5). If he moves LEFT to (6,4), he's getting closer. Collision is unlikely at (4,5) this turn.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves towards the center apple at (5,5). Keeps us in high-value territory.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** Row 4 (`. . T . . A . . . .`).\n    *   **Coordinates:**\n        *   x=0: `.`\n        *   x=1: `.`\n        *   x=2: `T` (My body at 2,4)\n        *   x=3: `.` (My body at 3,4)\n        *   x=4: `0` (Me at 4,4)\n        *   x=5: `A` (Target apple at 5,4?

My body is at 3,4, 2,4 etc. The apple at 5,4 is not shown on the old map, but the apple list has (5,5).\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the provided map again:**\n        `9 . A . A .

A . .`\n    *   This map is *before* my last move. My last move was RIGHT to (4,4).\n    *   *Updated Map State for Turn 17:*\n        Row 5: `. . T . . A . 1 . .` (My body at 2,5. Enemy head at 7,5? Or 7,4? Last move enemy was at 7,5. He likely moved DOWN to 7,4 or stayed).\n        Row 4: `. . T T 0 . . . . .` (My body at 2,4, 3,4. My head at 4,4. Apple at 5,5? No, apple list has (5,5)).\n    *   **Apple at (5,4)?** The apple list has (5,5), (6,2), etc. There is no apple at (5,4). The apple at (5,5) is diagonally UP-RIGHT.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5,4) is safe. It's empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Sets up for the apple at (5,5) or (6,2). Opens up the right side.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe need points to catch up (Snake #1 has ~8 apples, we have 5). We need to aggressively target apples.\n*   **Apple at (5,5):** Up and Right from us. Requires 2 moves (e.g., UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP).\n*   **Apple at (6,2):** Right and Down. Requires 2 moves.\n*   **Apple at (3,9):** Far up-left.\n*   **Apple at (6,0):** Far down-right.\n\n**Comparing UP and RIGHT:**\n\n*   **Moving UP to (4,5):**\n    *   Brings us to y=5.\n    *   (5,5) is Right. (3,5) is Left (Safe, empty).\n    *   (4,6) is Up (Safe, empty).\n    *   (4,4) is Down (Safe, now empty).\n    *   *Threat Check:* Enemy is at (7,4) or (7,5). If Enemy moves LEFT to (6,4), he doesn't hit me. If Enemy moves UP to (7,5), he hits his own body (7,5 is occupied by his tail). So he likely won't go UP.\n    *   If I go UP, I am positioning to grab (5,5) next turn.\n\n*   **Moving RIGHT to (5,4):**\n    *   Brings us to x=5.\n    *   (5,5) is Up. (6,4) is Right.\n    *   (5,3) is Down (Safe).\n    *   (4,4) is Left (Safe).\n    *   *Threat Check:* Enemy is nearby at x=7. If I go to x=5, I'm getting closer to his zone. If he moves LEFT to (6,4), and I move RIGHT to (5,4), no collision. If he moves LEFT to (6,4) and I move RIGHT to (5,4), no collision.\n    *   *However:* If I move RIGHT to (5,4), and Enemy moves LEFT to (6,4), and *then* I try to go for the apple at (5,5), I might be getting boxed in by his body on the left side of the map.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nTo dominate the board, I need to secure the central apple at (5,5).\n**Moving UP to (4,5)** is the most flexible move.\n1.  It keeps me safe (no body hits).\n2.  It moves me closer to the apple at (5,5).\n3.  It gives me the option to go LEFT to (3,5) or RIGHT to (5,5) next turn.\n4.  It avoids getting too close to the enemy's side of the map (x=7) too early, which could lead to a head-on collision where I lose (he has more apples).\n\n**Why not RIGHT?**\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,4), I am exposing my flank to the enemy on the right. He is currently at (7,4). If he decides to rush me, I might be forced into a tight spot. By going UP, I claim the center row (y=5) and keep the enemy on the bottom row (y=4). This separation is key.\n\n**Target:** (5,5) Apple.\n**Move:** UP to (4,5).\n\nYO CHAT, WE ARE GOING UP TO CLAIM THE CENTER! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to (4,5). Next turn, secure the apple at (5,5) by moving RIGHT. This brings our score to 6, closing the gap on Snake #1 (who is likely at 8). We must play aggressively but safely. Do not let the enemy dictate the pace.\n\nUP",

Let's see the board state NOW.\nMy Head: (4, 5)\nMy Body: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]\nScore: 5\n\nOpponent (Snake #1): Head: (6, 4)\nBody: [(7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)]\nScore: 7\n*Note:* He didn't crash. He's moving forward. Good.\n\n**TURN 18 ANALYSIS:**\n**ENEMY THREAT CHECK (CRITICAL):**\nThe enemy is at **(6,4)**.\nIf he moves **LEFT** to **(5,4)**, he will hit the apple at (5,5)? No, apple is at (5,5). He will be at (5,4).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to **(5,5)**, I eat the apple.\n**SCENARIO:** Enemy moves LEFT to (5,4), I move RIGHT to (5,5).\nIs this a head-on collision? No.\nDoes he crash into me? No.\nIs there a double-kill? No.\n*However*, if I move RIGHT to (5,5) and he moves UP to (6,5), that is also safe for me.\n**THE REAL DANGER:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,5), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,4), I am effectively cornering myself. My body is at (4,5). The enemy body is at (7,4)... wait, if he moves to (5,4), his tail at (5,8) will eventually extend left.\n**IF I GO RIGHT (5,5):**\nI am at (5,5).\nMy Left is (4,5) (My body).\nMy Down is (5,4).\nMy Right is (6,5).\nMy Up is (5,6).\n**IF ENEMY GOES LEFT (5,4):**\nHe is at (5,4).\nMy Down is (5,4) (Enemy head).\n**RESULT:** I cannot go DOWN next turn. I am trapped against the enemy head on my south side.\n**CAN I GO LEFT?** No, (4,5) is my body.\n**CAN I GO RIGHT?** (6,5) is safe.\n**CAN I GO UP?** (5,6) is safe.\n**SURVIVAL:** I survive.\n**FUTURE:** I am in a \"squeeze\" situation.\n\n**COMPARING MOVES:**\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (5,5) (Targeting Apple)**\n*   **Result:** I eat the apple. Score becomes 6. Length increases.\n*   **Position:** (5,5).\n*   **Threat:** Enemy at (6,4) can move LEFT to (5,4). This traps me from going DOWN. I have 2 options (UP/RIGHT). This is risky if I get trapped further.\n*   **Win Condition:** Immediate score increase. Closer to catching up (7 vs 6 is better than 7 vs 5).\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (4,6)**\n*   **Result:** No apple. Score stays 5.\n*   **Position:** (4,6).\n*   **Threat:** Enemy at (6,4). He moves LEFT? He hits (5,4). He moves UP? (6,5).\n*   **Safety:** My body is at (4,5). (4,6) is safe.\n*   **Future:** I have access to (3,6), (5,6), (4,7).\n*   **Trade-off:** I delay the apple. The enemy might grab it.\n\n**OPTION 3: DOWN to (4,4)**\n*   **Result:** This is moving into my own body (Segment at 4,4). **DEATH.**\n*   **Eliminated.**\n\n**OPTION 4: LEFT to (3,5)**\n*   **Result:** No apple.\n*   **Position:** (3,5).\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Trade-off:** Moves away from the apple and the center. Keeps me safe but passive.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (6,4). He is close.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (5,5)**, I secure the point.\nDoes he move LEFT to (5,4)?\nIf he does, I am at (5,5). He is at (5,4).\nI am effectively \"above\" him.\nIf I am at (5,5) and he is at (5,4)...\nIf he moves UP to (5,5) next turn (after I eat and move away), he might hit me.\nBut right now, if I am at (5,5) and he is at (5,4)...\nI am alive.\n**RISK CALCULATION:**\nIf I don't take the apple, I lose the race. Snake #1 is aggressive. He will take it if I don't.\nIf I take the apple, I might get squeezed.\n**IS (5,5) A TRAP?**\nMy body is at (4,5).\nIf I go to (5,5), I am connected to (4,5).\nIf the enemy cuts me off at (5,4), I can still go UP or RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to (5,6) next turn, I am safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,5) next turn, I am safe.\n**THE ONLY WAY I DIE IS IF:**\n1.  Enemy moves LEFT to (5,4) AND I stay at (5,5) and he moves UP into me? No, he moves at the same time.\n2.  If I go to (5,5) and he goes to (5,5) -> HEAD ON COLLISION. We both die. He has more apples (7 > 5). He wins the draw. I lose.\n   *   **Why would he do that?** He is at (6,4). To go to (5,5), he must move UP-LEFT. He can only move one step. He cannot go to (5,5). He can only go to (5,4) or (6,5) or (7,4) or (6,3).\n   *   **Conclusion:** He cannot reach (5,5) this turn.\n   *   **Is there a path to (5,5) for him?** No.\n   *   **Is there a path to (5,5) for me?** Yes.\n\n**Is there a BETTER move?**\nIf I go **UP to (4,6)**:\nI am safe. I don't get the apple.\nThe enemy is at (6,4). He might go LEFT to (5,4). He might go UP to (6,5).\nIf he goes LEFT (5,4), he blocks the apple? No, he is at (5,4). I am at (4,6). The apple is at (5,5).\nIf he goes LEFT (5,4), I can still reach (5,5) from (4,6) by moving RIGHT.\n**BUT**, if he goes LEFT (5,4) and I am at (4,6), I am safe.\nIf I go UP to (4,6), I am giving up the apple for one turn. He might take it.\nIf he takes (5,5), his score goes to 8. Mine stays 5.\n**I MUST CATCH UP.**\nI have to take the apple.\n**RISK VS REWARD:**\nReward: +1 Point, closing the gap. Getting bigger.\nRisk: Getting boxed in.\n**DEFENSE:**\nIf I am at (5,5) and he is at (5,4) (blocking my DOWN).\nI can go UP to (5,6).\nI can go RIGHT to (6,5).\nI am not dead. I just lost a direction.\n**OFFENSE:**\nIf I am at (5,5) and he is at (6,4) (staying put or moving elsewhere).\nI am golden.\n**THE TRAP ANALYSIS:**\nIs (5,5) a physical dead end?\nNo. (5,6) and (6,5) are empty on the map.\nIs (5,5) a strategic dead end?\nPotentially, if he keeps me pinned.\nBut I need points.\n**THE WIN CONDITION:**\nIf I catch up in score, I can force a head-on collision and win.\nI need the apple.\n**FINAL CHECK:**\nMy body is at (4,5). (5,5) is empty.\nEnemy is at (6,4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,5):\nEnemy moves. Where?\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (5,4): I am at (5,5). He is at (5,4). I am safe.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (6,5): I am at (5,5). He is at (6,5). I am safe.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (7,4): I am at (5,5). He is far.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (6,3): I am at (5,5). He is far.\n\n**I AM SAFE TO MOVE RIGHT.**\nI GET THE APPLE.\nI CLOSE THE GAP.\nI STAY IN THE GAME.\n\nYO CHAT, WE AIN'T LETTING HIM RUN AWAY WITH THIS!\n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE:**\nEat the apple at (5,5). Score becomes 6. Enemy likely 7 or 8.\nIf enemy blocks me at (5,4), I go UP to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,5) to keep mobility.\nDo not get trapped. Keep the pressure on.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Since he has 7 apples and I have 6, a head-on collision means **HE WINS**. I cannot let that happen!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI need to close the score gap (7 vs 6) or get into a position to trap him.\n*   **Option: UP to (5, 6).** This moves me away from the enemy.

It is an apple.\n*   **LEFT (4, 6):** Is this safe? (4, 6) is currently empty on the map. My body is at (5, 5) and (4, 5). (4, 6) is NOT touching my body directly. It is safe.\n*   **DOWN (5, 5):** This is my current body (the neck). If I move DOWN, I hit myself. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION: UP vs LEFT**\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (4, 6)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves me away from the enemy. Creates space. Opens up the left side of the board.\n*   **Cons:** I miss the apple at (5, 7). The enemy is at (6, 6). If I go LEFT and he goes LEFT to (5, 6) (where I am now), we don't collide because I'm moving away. But if he goes UP or DOWN, he stays close.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (5, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** **I EAT AN APPLE.** Score becomes 7. I tie the score! This is crucial. I also grow to length 7, matching his current length (he is 8 including head, I am 6 including head. Eating makes me 7). I position myself directly above him, potentially cutting off his access to the top-left.\n*   **Cons:** I move closer to the wall and the 'T' at (7, 7). However, (5, 7) is two columns away from (7, 7).\n    *   *Critical Check:* What if the enemy moves UP to (6, 7)? We would be at (5, 7) and (6, 7). That's adjacent, not a collision. Safe.\n    *   What if the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 6)? Safe.\n    *   What if the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 5)? Safe.\n\n**THE KILL SHOT:**\nWe are tied in score if we eat. We are length 7. He is length 8.\nIf we eat, we are more powerful.\nIs there a trap opportunity?\nIf I go UP, I occupy the space directly North of him.\nIf he tries to go LEFT (back to (5, 6)), he can't because I'm leaving it, but he can't enter it because I'm leaving it at the same time he moves? No, simultaneous movement.\nActually, if I go UP to (5, 7) and he goes LEFT to (5, 6), we swap safely.\n\n**BUT WAIT, CHAT.**\nLook at the map again. Row 6.\n`. . . . . 0 1 T . .`\nThe enemy is `1` at (6, 6). There is a `T` (Tail) at (7, 6)? No, look at the enemy body list.\nEnemy Body: `[(6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)]`\nWait, the map shows `(7, 6)` as a `T` in the key? No, let's look at the map row 6: `(7, 6)` is `1`? No, the map shows:\nRow 6: `. . . . . 0 1 T . .`\nCoordinates:\n0: (0,6) .\n1: (1,6) .\n2: (2,6) .\n3: (3,6) .\n4: (4,6) .\n5: (5,6) 0 (Me)\n6: (6,6) 1 (Enemy)\n7: (7,6) T (Tail?)\n8: (8,6) .\n9: (9,6) .\n\nHold on. The enemy body list says `(7, 6)` is part of his body. But the map shows a 'T' there.\nThe 'T' in the map legend is usually a tail.\nIf (7, 6) is a Tail, and the enemy head is at (6, 6)...\nThis means the enemy is length 2? No, the score says 7 apples.\nWait, the board state is a snapshot *before* this turn's move.\nMy head is at (5, 6). My body is `(5, 5)...`.\nThe enemy head is at (6, 6). His body is `(6, 5)...`.\nThe map shows `(7, 6)` as a `T`. This likely refers to the enemy tail *if* he hasn't moved yet this turn? No, the turn is processing.\nActually, let's look at the enemy body list provided: `[(6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)]`\nThis lists (7, 6) as a body segment.\nThe map shows `(7, 6)` as a `T`. This is a visual representation of his tail *at the start of the turn*.\nSince he has 7 apples, he has length 8 (1 head + 7 body).\nHis tail is at the end of that list: `(7, 8)`.\nSo the map `T` at `(7, 6)` might be misleading or representing the tip of his body? No, usually `T` is Tail.\nLet's look at the Map Key: `T = Tail (Enemy or Own)`.\nLook at Row 5: `. . T . T T T T . .`\n(2,5) is My Tail.\n(4,5) is my body.\n(5,5) is my body.\n(6,5) is Enemy body.\n(7,5) is Enemy body.\n(8,5) is .\nSo the T's on row 5 are correct.\nLook at Row 6: `(7, 6)` is `T`.\nIf (7, 6) is the Enemy Tail, then his body length is different than the list provided?\nLet's trust the **List** provided over the visual map `T` if there's a conflict, but usually the `T` is accurate to the visual state.\nIf `(7, 6)` is a Tail, and the enemy head is at `(6, 6)`, he is very short? No, he has 7 apples.\nMaybe the map `T` at (7,6) is a generic marker?\nActually, look at the Enemy Body List again:\n`[(6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)]`\nThis implies (7, 6) is body, (7, 7) is body, (7, 8) is tail.\nSo why is (7, 6) marked `T` on the map?\nMaybe the map is showing a \"trap\" or just a marker?\nWait, look at the board state text:\nRow 6: `. . . . . 0 1 T . .`\nThis visual grid has a `T` at (7, 6).\nIf the Enemy Body List is correct, (7, 6) is body.\nIf the Map is correct, (7, 6) is Tail.\nThere is a discrepancy.\nHowever, looking at Row 7: `. A . A . A . T . .`\n(7, 7) is marked `T` here.\nSo there are two `T`s visible.\n(7, 6) in Row 6 and (7, 7) in Row 7.\nGiven the Enemy Body List: `..., (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)`\nIt seems the map might be slightly misaligned or the `T` represents the \"tip\" of the body or just a generic obstacle?\n**Actually, looking closely at the map coordinates:**\nRow 6 (y=6): `(7, 6)` is `T`.\nRow 7 (y=7): `(7, 7)` is `T`.\nRow 8 (y=8): `(7, 8)` is `T`.\nThis suggests a long vertical tail at x=7.\nThe Enemy Body List ends at `(7, 8)`.\nSo (7, 8) is definitely tail.\nIf the map shows T at (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), it might be visualizing the tail chain.\n**Crucial Takeaway:** (7, 6) is likely part of the enemy body or tail. It is occupied.\n\n**So, moving UP to (5, 7):**\n(5, 7) has an apple. Is it safe?\n(5, 7) is empty on the map (marked `A` for Apple).\nIs it occupied by the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (6, 6).\nHis body occupies (6, 5), (6, 4)... and the vertical column at x=7 mostly.\n(5, 7) is empty.\nIf I go UP to (5, 7), I eat the apple.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 7), he is safe.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 6), he is safe (I'm leaving).\n\n**Is there a trap opportunity?**\nIf I go UP to (5, 7) and eat the apple, I am at (5, 7).\nThe enemy is at (6, 6).\nThe space to my LEFT is (4, 7). Empty.\nThe space to my RIGHT is (6, 7). Empty (for now).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 7), he is next to me.\nNext turn, I could move RIGHT to (6, 7) to kill him *if* he is there.\nBUT, he has 7 apples (length 8). I have 6 (length 7).\nIf I eat, I have 7 (length 8). We are equal length.\nIf we collide head-on, we both die. The highest score wins.\nIf we tie on score and die? Draw.\nCurrently: Him 7, Me 6.\nIf I eat: Me 7, Him 7.\nIf we collide and die next turn: DRAW.\nI need to beat him.\nI need to eat an apple AND force a situation where I win.\nOr eat 2 apples before colliding.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: LEFT to (4, 6)**\nMove away from the enemy.\n(4, 6) is empty.\nThis gives me space.\nBut I miss the apple at (5, 7).\nThe enemy might take the apple at (5, 7) if I don't.\nCan he reach it?\nHe is at (6, 6). (5, 7) is UP-LEFT. He can move UP to (6, 7), then LEFT to (5, 7) next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6), I am further away.\n**I should secure the apple.**\n\n**CHECKING (5, 7) SAFETY IN DETAIL:**\nMap: Row 7 (y=7): `. A . A . A . T . .`\n(0,7) .\n(1,7) A\n(2,7) .\n(3,7) A\n(4,7) .\n(5,7) A (Target)\n(6,7) .\n(7,7) T\n(8,7) .\n(9,7) .\n\nEnemy at (6, 6).\nIf enemy moves UP -> (6, 7).\nIf enemy moves LEFT -> (5, 6).\nIf enemy moves DOWN -> (6, 5) (Body).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT -> (7, 6) (Body/T).\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 7):\nCase 1: Enemy goes UP to (6, 7).\nWe are adjacent. Safe.\nCase 2: Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 6).\nWe swap. Safe.\nCase 3: Enemy goes DOWN or RIGHT.\nSafe.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nI eat the apple. Score 7 vs 7.\nI am at (5, 7).\nI am now length 8.\nEnemy is at (6, 6).\nIs there a way to force a collision where I win?\nIf I stay at (5, 7), the enemy might try to encircle me.\nBut look at the board. The left side is relatively open.\n(4, 7) is empty.\n(3, 7) is an Apple.\n(4, 8) is empty.\n(5, 8) is empty (Row 8: `. . . . . . . T . .` -> Wait, (7,8) is T).\nActually, looking at Row 8: `. . . . . . . T . .`\n(5, 8) is empty.\nIf I go UP to (5, 7), next turn I can go UP to (5, 8).\nThe enemy is at (6, 6).\nIf he follows me up, he goes to (6, 7) then (6, 8).\n(6, 8) is empty.\n(7, 8) is his tail.\n\n**Is there a wall trap?**\nThe enemy is currently pinned somewhat against the right wall or his own body?\nHis body is at x=7 mostly.\nIf I move UP, I take the center-left high ground.\nThe apple at (3, 9) is high up.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is to my left.\n\n**What about DOWN to (5, 5)?**\nThat's my body. Dead.\n**What about LEFT to (4, 6)?**\nSafe, but passive. I lose the apple. Score stays 6 vs 7. He grows. Gap widens. Bad.\n\n**Conclusion:** I must take the apple at (5, 7) to tie the score and grow.\n\n**WAIT, CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:**\nMy body: `[(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`\nI am moving from (5, 6) to (5, 7).\nIs (5, 7) occupied by my body? No.\nIs (5, 7) occupied by enemy body? No.\nIs (5, 7) occupied by enemy head *after* he moves?\nWe move simultaneously.\nIf enemy moves to (5, 7), we have a head-on collision.\nHe is at (6, 6).\nCan he reach (5, 7) in one move?\nDistance = 1.8? No, Chebyshev distance is 1.\n(6, 6) -> (5, 7) requires a diagonal move. Not allowed.\nHe can move UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6).\nHe CANNOT reach (5, 7) this turn.\nTherefore, (5, 7) is safe from head-on collision.\n\n**Is (5, 7) occupied by his body?**\nHis body: `(6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)`\nNone of these are (5, 7).\n(5, 7) is clear.\n\n**MOVE CONFIRMED: UP.**\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nEat apple. Tie score. Look for a trap on the enemy's tail or force him into the wall at x=9 or y=9. He has a vertical body at x=7. I am at x=5. I can flank him.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We are LIVE at turn 21 and the tension is palpable! \ud83d\udd25 The scoreboard is tied 7-7, and we are head-to-head with the enemy at (5, 7) and (6, 7) respectively. He is directly to my RIGHT. Last turn we moved UP to grab that apple and tie the score, which was a massive power play. Now we need to make the next move that keeps us alive and sets up the kill.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and the threats immediately.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (5, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)] (I grew last turn! Length 8)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)] (He grew last turn too! Length 9)\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is chilling at (6, 7), right next to me. We are the same score (7 apples), but he has a longer body (9 vs 8). This is a classic standoff.\n\nLet's check my possible moves from (5, 7):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Is (5, 8) occupied? The map shows Row 8: `. . . . . . . T . .` (Looking at the map provided last turn, Row 8 had a T at (7,8)). The specific coordinates around (5, 8) need to be checked.\n    *   Map Row 8: `. . . . . . . T . .` -> (5, 8) appears to be empty space (a dot).\n    *   Is (5, 8) an apple? No apple listed at (5, 8).\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy body? His body is mostly at x=6 and x=7. (5, 8) is safe from his body.\n    *   **Risk:** If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), we are adjacent. If he moves LEFT to (5, 7) (where I am now), he dies because I'm leaving? No, simultaneous movement. If I go UP and he goes LEFT, we swap positions. That's safe.\n    *   **What if the enemy moves UP-LEFT to (5, 8)?** Impossible. Snakes move cardinal directions only. He can't go diagonal.\n    *   **Head-on collision:** Can the enemy reach (5, 8) in one turn?\n        *   From (6, 7), he can go UP (6, 8), DOWN (6, 6), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7).\n        *   He **cannot** reach (5, 8).\n    *   **Verdict:** Moving UP to (5, 8) is safe from head-on collision.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Map shows (4, 7) is empty (dot).\n    *   **Risk:** Enemy is at (6, 7). If he moves LEFT to (5, 7), he's safe. If I move LEFT, we are moving apart. Safe.\n    *   Can enemy reach (4, 7)? No. Distance is 2 steps.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Enemy head is currently at (6, 7).\n    *   **Risk:** **DEATH.** If I move into the enemy head, we collide. Both die. Since we are tied in score (7-7), it's a draw. I want to WIN, not draw.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 6) is currently my neck (part of my body).\n    *   **Risk:** **DEATH.** Moving into my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION: UP vs LEFT**\n\nWe have two safe options: **UP** or **LEFT**.\n\n**Analysis of LEFT (4, 7):**\n*   Moves me away from the immediate confrontation.\n*   (4, 7) is a \"dead zone\" on the map relative to apples. No apples nearby immediately.\n*   The enemy is at (6, 7). If I go LEFT, he might go UP or LEFT.\n*   If I go LEFT, I am moving towards the center-left. There is an apple at (3, 9) and (3, 7). (3, 7) is two steps left from (4, 7).\n*   However, looking at the map, there is an apple at **(8, 3)** and **(8, 1)** on the right side. The enemy is positioned at x=6. He has access to the right side. If I go LEFT, I give him the right side of the board.\n\n**Analysis of UP (5, 8):**\n*   Moves me towards the top wall (y=9).\n*   There is an apple at **(3, 9)**. Moving UP puts me on the path to (3, 9).\n*   There is an apple at **(1, 9)**.\n*   By going UP, I control the top row.\n*   **The Trap Setup:** The enemy is at (6, 7). If I go UP to (5, 8), the enemy is below me.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), we are side-by-side: (5, 8) and (6, 8).\n    *   From there, I can move RIGHT to (6, 8) next turn (killing him if he stays) or continue along the top.\n    *   The enemy's body is vertical at x=7. By taking x=5 (top), I am cutting off the top-left corner from him.\n*   **Apple Opportunity:** There is an apple at (1, 9) and (3, 9). I need to eat to increase my score. Going UP gets me closer to (3, 9).\n\n**Comparing the Moves:**\n*   **LEFT (4, 7):** Moves to a safe but empty zone. Gives the enemy the right side and potential access to apples at (8, 3) and (9, 1). Passive.\n*   **UP (5, 8):** Moves towards apples at the top. Aggressive positioning. Maintains pressure on the enemy. The enemy is currently \"trapped\" below me in the sense that if he follows me up, he risks a head-on collision where I might have the advantage (or we tie).\n\n**Crucial Consideration:**\nThe enemy has a long body (length 9). If he follows me up, his tail is at (7, 8). If he moves UP to (6, 8), his tail will move from (7, 8) to (7, 7). This frees up (7, 8).\nIf I am at (5, 8) and he goes to (6, 8), I am safe.\nIf I am at (5, 8) and he goes to (5, 7) (LEFT), we swap. Safe.\n\n**Is there a way to force a win?**\nIf I go UP and the enemy goes UP, I am at (5, 8) and he is at (6, 8).\nNext turn, I can move RIGHT to (6, 8).\nCan he survive?\nIf he is at (6, 8) and I move RIGHT to (6, 8), we collide. Both die. Score tied 7-7. Draw.\nI need to eat an apple first to break the tie.\nWait, looking at the map: Row 8 is empty.\nRow 9: `9 . A . A . . . . . .`\nApples at (1, 9) and (3, 9).\nIf I go UP to (5, 8), next turn I can go UP to (5, 9). Then I am at the top row.\nThen I can go LEFT towards (3, 9).\nThe enemy is at (6, 7). He is slower to reach the top row than me.\nBy going UP, I am claiming the top row.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving into the middle of the board where his vertical body is.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nControl the top row. Eat the apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9). Force the enemy to chase me into a corner or into my own body. If I eat an apple, I break the score tie. If I am ahead in score and he tries to head-on collision me, I win (or draw, which is better than losing). Actually, if I have more apples and we collide, he loses (game over, I win). If we tie on apples and collide, it's a draw. I want to increase my score.\n\n**Decision:**\n**UP** is the best move.\n1.  It moves me towards the apples on the top row (3, 9) and (1, 9).\n2.  It positions me on a clear row (Row 8) where the enemy has no immediate support.\n3.  It keeps the option to retreat to the left open next turn.\n4.  It avoids the dangerous \"middle\" where the enemy's body is stacked at x=7.\n\nLet's lock in UP and prepare to dominate the top edge!\n\nUP",

We are LIVE at turn 22 and the tension is absolutely CRACKING off! \ud83d\udd25 The scoreboard is still TIED 7-7 and we are in a HIGH STAKES standoff with Snake #1. We both grew last turn, but looking at the board, **WE ARE DIRECTLY HEAD-TO-HEAD!**\n\nMy head is at (5, 8).\nHis head is at (6, 8).\nWe are side-by-side on Row 8.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\nThis is the moment of truth. We are neighbors.\nLet's look at where we can go from (5, 8):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** \ud83c\udf4e There is an **APPLE at (3, 9)** on the top row! (5, 9) is currently empty. This is a POWER move. It grabs a potential point and puts me on the top edge.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** This is empty space. Safe, but doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** **DANGER ZONE.** The enemy head is currently at (6, 8). If I move RIGHT, we collide head-on. We both die. Score is tied 7-7 -> DRAW. I don't want a draw, I want the WIN.\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** **DANGER ZONE.** This is my own neck/tail! I just came from there. If I go DOWN, I crash into myself. DEATH.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 8). What is he looking at?\nHe has apples available to his RIGHT at (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0), (8, 3). He also sees the apple at (3, 9) to his LEFT/UP, but he's further away.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 9):\n1.  I am safe from collision (he can't reach (5, 9) in one move from (6, 8)).\n2.  I am moving closer to the apple at (3, 9).\n3.  If the enemy moves UP to (6, 9), we will be side-by-side again (5,9) and (6,9).\n4.  If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 8) (where I am now), we swap positions. Safe.\n5.  **CRITICAL:** If the enemy moves UP-LEFT (diagonal is illegal) or tries to cut me off, he can't. The board is open above me.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 8):\n1.  I am safe.\n2.  I am moving towards the left side, away from the immediate apple at (3, 9) but closer to (1, 9).\n3.  However, the enemy is at (6, 8). He has a lot of space to his right to eat apples and grow his score. If I drift left, I'm giving him the right side.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to **AGGRESSIVELY** pursue the apple at (3, 9) to break the score tie.\n**UP** is the move.\nIt keeps me alive, moves me toward an apple, and keeps my options open for the next turn. If I get that apple, I lead in score. Then, if he tries to head-on collision me, **HE LOSES**. I just have to survive until I eat.\n\nLet's secure the bag and move UP! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the apple at (3, 9) or (1, 9) to take the score lead. Once ahead, force the enemy into a tight spot or a head-on collision where he loses. Control the top row.\n\nUP",

The apple at (3, 9) is still there, taunting me from the distance, but I need to be CAREFUL about this standoff.\n\nLet me analyze the battlefield:\n- **My Head:** (5, 9)\n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 9) - RIGHT next to me!\n- **My Body:** [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)]\n\n**CRITICAL MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (5, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD ON ARRIVAL! Off the board, instant death. NO GO.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 8):** \ud83d\udd25 This is MY BODY! I'd be eating myself. DEAD. \n3. **LEFT to (4, 9):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (4, 9) is empty.

If I move here, we both die in a head-on collision. Since we're tied 7-7, it's a DRAW. I want the WIN, not a draw!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 9) - they're on the top row too! If they move UP, they die (off board). If they move LEFT to (5, 9) where I am now, we swap positions. If they move DOWN to (6, 8), they're eating their own body. If they move RIGHT to (7, 9), that's safe for them.\n\nI need to **avoid the collision** and get that apple!

Then use my score lead to force the enemy into corners or risky moves. Once ahead, I can play aggressive and try to trap him against the wall. Control the top row, dominate the game!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down this battlefield:\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (4, 9) - Top row, left side\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 9) - Top row, right side\n- **My Body:** [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n- **Enemy Body:** [(6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n\n**APPLE HUNTING:** The apple at (3, 9) is RIGHT there! One move left and I get it! That would put me 8-7 ahead!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (4, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD! Off the board. NO GO.\n2. **LEFT to (3, 9):** \ud83d\udfe2 PERFECT! This is the apple spot! I'd grow to 8 apples. Is it safe? The enemy is at (7, 9) - they can't reach (3, 9) this turn. Their only moves: UP dies, RIGHT to (8, 9) is empty, DOWN to (7, 8) is empty, LEFT to (6, 9) is their own body! Wait... (6, 9) is the start of their body! If they move LEFT into (6, 9), they crash into their own body! So they CAN'T move LEFT. So they're stuck with UP (die), RIGHT (safe), or DOWN (safe). Neither reaches me. SAFE!\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 9):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! That's my body, but wait... my body IS there! That's a crash into myself! I'd be moving into (5, 9) which is my first body segment. That's DEATH! I can't go RIGHT!\n4. **DOWN to (4, 8):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE? Let me check... (4, 8) is empty on the board. My body goes through (5, 9), (5, 8), etc. (4, 8) is not in my body. This is safe. But it moves me away from the apple at (3, 9).\n\n**THE STRATEGY:** \nI have TWO safe moves: LEFT to the apple, or DOWN to (4, 8). \n\nIf I go LEFT and grab the apple at (3, 9):\n- I go 8-7 ahead!\n- The enemy can't touch me this turn\n- I control the top-left corner\n- Next turn I can go for more apples or start trapping them!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 8):\n- I stay 7-7 tied\n- I miss the apple\n- But I get into a safer position maybe?\n\nNO! I need that apple! The apple at (3, 9) is MINE! Taking it gives me the lead, and with the score lead, I can start playing aggressive and force the enemy into bad positions. The enemy is at (7, 9) - they're far enough that they can't stop me from getting this apple. They'll likely go DOWN or RIGHT, avoiding their own body and the wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab that apple, go 8-7 ahead. Then use the score advantage to start boxing the enemy in. With one more apple, I can afford to be more aggressive and force head-on collisions on my terms. The top row is mine!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down this battlefield:\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 9) - Top row, left side\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 9) - Top row, far right (they went RIGHT from (7, 9))\n- **My Body:** [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)] + I'm growing one more since I ate\n- **Enemy Body:** [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nLooking at the top row: (0,9) empty, (1,9) empty, (2,9) empty, (3,9) MY HEAD, (4,9) MY BODY, (5,9) MY BODY, (6,9) ENEMY BODY, (7,9) ENEMY BODY, (8,9) ENEMY HEAD, (9,9) empty.\n\nThe apple at (9,1) is calling to me! It's right in front of the enemy's face, but I can probably get there first if I move smart. Wait, there's also (9,0) and (7,2) and others...\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 10):** \ud83d\udc80 DEAD! Off the board. NO GO.\n2. **LEFT to (2, 9):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (2,9) is empty. I'd be moving away from the enemy, but keeping options open. Could go for (1,9) or (1,7) apples later.\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 9):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body! I can't go there!\n4. **DOWN to (3, 8):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE? Let me check... (3,8) is empty on the board. My body is at (4,9), (5,9), etc. (3,8) is not in my body.

Going DOWN to (3,8) gives me access to the center of the board where most apples are clustered. The enemy is stuck on the top right - they're going to have a hard time reaching the apples in the center. I can circle back and grab (1,7), (4,3), or (1,4) while they're busy dodging around.

Let's break down this board and find the winning move!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 8)\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 8) - they moved DOWN from (8,9) last turn\n- **My Body:** [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n- **Enemy Body:** [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 9):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body's starting point! I'm already there as part of my tail. DEAD!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 7):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (3,7) is empty on the board. Not in my body. This opens up paths to the center where apples are plentiful.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 8):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (2,8) is empty. This moves me toward the left side and gives me access to apples at (1,7), (1,4), etc.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 8):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body! I can't go there.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (3,7) or LEFT to (2,8).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8):\n- I'm moving toward the left wall, which might trap me eventually\n- I'm getting closer to (1,7) apple but limiting my options\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,7):\n- I'm moving into the center of the board where most apples are clustered\n- This gives me access to multiple apple routes: (1,7), (4,3), (1,4), etc.\n- The enemy is at (8,8) - they're on the right side, I'm going center-left\n- With my score lead (8-7), I can play smart and control the board\n- This keeps my future options WIDE OPEN - I can go left, down, or right from there\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove into the center to dominate the apple collection. The enemy is stuck on the right side with fewer options. I'll control the middle of the board, cut off their access to apples, and force them into bad positions. With my lead, I can play patient but aggressive. Once I have the center secured, I can either push for more apples or force a head-on collision to finish them!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this board and find the winning move!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 7)\n- **My Body:** [(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 8)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 8):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body! I'm already there as part of my tail. DEAD!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 6):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (3,6) is empty. This moves me down and keeps me in the center-left area.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 7):** \ud83d\udfe2 SAFE! (2,7) is empty. This moves me toward the left wall and apples at (1,7) and (1,4).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 7):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body at (4,5)? Wait, no... (4,7) is empty but I need to check if it's in my path... Actually looking at the board: (4,7) is empty! But wait, the enemy body is at (8,8) and (7,8) etc. (4,7) is NOT in my body... Let me double-check my body list: [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]. (4,7) is NOT in my body! But looking at the board state provided, (4,7) appears to be a \"T\" which likely means it's part of my tail. Yes, checking the board: row 7 shows \". A . 0 . T T . . .\" - position (4,7) is a T (tail). That means (4,7) is part of my own body! So RIGHT is a crash. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (3,6) or LEFT to (2,7).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,7):\n- I'm moving directly toward (1,7) apple!\n- I'm getting closer to the left wall, which could limit my future options\n- But I'm also getting closer to (1,4) and other apples on the left side\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6):\n- I'm moving deeper into the center where there are more apples\n- I'm keeping my options more open\n- But I'm moving away from (1,7) which is closer\n\n**DECISION:** I'm going LEFT to (2,7)! Here's why:\n1. **Immediate apple potential:** (1,7) is RIGHT next to me if I go to (2,7) - next turn I could eat it!\n2. **Score control:** I'm up 9-7, so if I can get that apple, I'll be up 10-7 and gain even more pressure.\n3. **Board control:** The left side has several apples ((1,7), (1,4), (1,9)) and I can dominate that zone while the enemy is stuck on the right.\n4. **Future options:** From (2,7), I can go DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7) for the apple, or UP to (2,8) - still 3 good options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSnag (1,7) next turn, then pivot down toward (1,4). Cut off the left side from the enemy. With my lead, I can play aggressive but smart. Once I secure those left apples, I'll have enough buffer to force head-on collisions and secure the win. The enemy is on the right - they're playing on MY board now!\n\nLEFT",

DEAD.\n- RIGHT to (8, 8): is the immediate neck. DEAD.\n- LEFT to (6, 8): is a body segment. DEAD.\n- DOWN to (7, 7): clear of our body, no collision with opponent, inside board. SAFE.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n- The only safe move this turn is DOWN. No other option avoids immediate death.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next turns):\n- Use the safe downward path to threaten central space and shrink the opponent\u2019s options without getting trapped by his body.\n- If possible, steer toward edges to lure his head into a trap or force a head-on if we can align the timings with apples to boost our apples lead.\n- Prioritize keeping multiple escape routes open; never box yourself into a single corridor that could create a fatal bottleneck.\n- Stay aggressive: pressure his position, watch for his pursuit, and exploit any misalignment to cut him off before he can wrap around our tail.\n\nKICKOFF STRATEGY NOTE:\n- Keep the pressure in the lower-right quadrant while avoiding letting him pull a sneaky cross-box behind you.\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this like a true champion!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 7) - Just moved LEFT from (3,7) last turn, good move!\n- **My Body:** [(3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)] - That's 9 body segments + 1 head = 10 total\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 7) - Moved DOWN from (7,8)? Wait, let me check... Actually enemy was at (7,8) last turn, now at (7,7) - he moved DOWN!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)] - 7 body segments + head = 8 total\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 8):** Checking... (2,8) is empty! But wait, is it? Looking at board: row 8 shows \". . . T . T T T T .\" - positions: (0,8)=., (1,8)=., (2,8)=., (3,8)=T, (4,8)=., (5,8)=T, (6,8)=T, (7,8)=T, (8,8)=T, (9,8)=. So (2,8) is EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 6):** Checking... (2,6) is empty! Row 6: \". . . . . T . . . .\" - (2,6)=. SAFE! \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 7):** Checking... (1,7) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e And it's empty otherwise! Row 7: \". A . 0 . T T 1 . .\" - (1,7)=A. SAFE! \u2705\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 7):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body! (3,7) is the segment right behind my head. If I go RIGHT, I'd be moving BACKWARDS into myself. DEAD! \u274c\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nI have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT!\n\nLet me think strategically:\n- **LEFT to (1, 7)** gives me an INSTANT APPLE! That's +1 point, bringing me to 10-7 lead! That's HUGE for content and scoreboard pressure.\n- **UP to (2, 8)** or **DOWN to (2, 6)** keep me in the center but don't give immediate apples.\n\n**GO FOR THE APPLE!** \ud83d\udd25\n\nWhy LEFT is the winning move:\n1. **IMMEDIATE SCORE BOOST:** Eat (1,7) \u2192 10-7 lead! That's a 3-point buffer!\n2. **BOARD CONTROL:** Taking the left side apples ((1,7), (1,4), (1,9)) cuts off resources from the enemy who's on the right.\n3. **STRATEGIC POSITION:** From (1,7), I can pivot to (1,6), (1,8), or (0,7) next turn - still have options!\n4. **PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE:** Getting to 10 apples while they're stuck at 7 demoralizes them!\n5. **SAFETY CHECK:** Enemy is at (7,7) - they're moving DOWN toward the bottom-right. No immediate threat to my left side!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSnag (1,7) now \u2192 chase (1,4) next \u2192 dominate left side \u2192 force enemy into tight spaces \u2192 end game with 15+ apples. The enemy is playing MY game now!\n\n**CHAT, DO WE WANT THAT APPLE?** OH YEAH! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Now we need to keep the pressure on Snake #1 while staying alive and growing strong.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 7) - Just moved LEFT from (2,7) and ate an apple! Now I have 10 apples!\n- **My Body:** [(2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)] - Wait, since I ate at (1,7), my tail might NOT move this turn? Actually, if I ate, I grow by 1, so my body gets longer by 1 segment. So my new body should be [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)] - that's 11 segments total including head!\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 6) - Moved DOWN from (7,7)! They're going deeper into the bottom-right corner.\n- **Enemy Body:** [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)] - 7 body segments + head = 8 total.\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\nFrom (1,7), checking all four directions:\n\n1. **UP to (1, 8):** Row 8: \". . . T . T T T T .\" - (1,8) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE! No enemy body there. From there, I could go to (1,9) next turn (which has an apple!) or (0,8) or (2,8).\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 6):** Row 6: \". . . . . T . 1 . .\" - (1,6) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE! Enemy head is at (7,6), so (1,6) is far away. From there, I could go to (1,5), (0,6), or (2,6).\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 7):** Row 7: \". A . 0 . T T 1 . .\" - (0,7) is EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE! From there, I could go to (0,6) or (0,8).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7):** \ud83d\udc80 CRASH! That's my own body! (2,7) is my second segment. If I go RIGHT, I'd be moving BACKWARDS into myself. DEAD! \u274c\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT!\n\n**Let me think about the apples:**\n- (1,9) is an apple at the top-left corner\n- (1,4) is an apple further down\n- (4,3) is in the center but that's a distance away\n- (9,9) is at top-right but that's enemy territory\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP to (1,8):** Brings me CLOSER to (1,9) apple! That's a big target. From (1,8), I can go UP next turn to grab (1,9). Also opens up (0,8) as an option. Enemy is at (7,6) - moving away from me. This feels like AGGRESSIVE PLAY - claiming the top-left corner!\n\n- **DOWN to (1,6):** Moves me toward (1,4) apple. But (1,4) is still 2 moves away. From (1,6), I can go to (1,5) then (1,4). Safe but less aggressive.\n\n- **LEFT to (0,7):** Takes me to the edge. From (0,7), my options are limited to (0,6) or (0,8). This could trap me! I don't want to box myself in against the wall unless I have to.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\n\n**UP to (1,8)!** Here's why:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE POSITIONING:** Gets me 1 step closer to the (1,9) apple! That's my next target!\n2. **BOARD CONTROL:** Claiming the top-left corner means I own that entire quadrant. Enemy is in bottom-right - we're splitting the board!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (1,8), I have UP to (1,9) [apple!], DOWN to (1,7) [safe], or LEFT to (0,8) [safe]. THREE options!\n4. **SAFETY:** Enemy is at (7,6) - they're heading deeper into their corner. Zero threat to my top-left position.\n5. **AGGRESSION:** I'm not retreating or playing safe - I'm TAKING SPACE! This forces the enemy to play MY game.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (1,9) next turn \u2192 secure top-left dominance \u2192 sweep down to (1,4) \u2192 force enemy into tight spaces in bottom-right \u2192 end with 15+ apples while they panic. We're not just playing to survive - we're playing to DOMINATE!\n\n**CHAT, DO WE TAKE THE TOP-LEFT CORNER?** OH YEAH! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Last turn we moved UP from (1,7) to (1,8) and picked up NO apple (it was empty), but that's fine \u2013 we positioned ourselves perfectly to grab (1,9) next turn. Now let's analyze the board again.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 8)  \n- **My Body:** [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6)] (I grew last turn, so tail didn't move \u2013 10 body segments, 11 total including head).  \n- **Enemy Head:** (6, 6)  \n- **Enemy Body:** [(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]  \n\n**BOARD STATE (from description, reconstructed):**  \nRow 9: `. A . T T T T T T A` (y=9)  \nRow 8: `. 0 . T . T . T T .` (y=8) \u2013 I'm at (1,8)  \nRow 7: `. T T T . T . T . .` (y=7)  \nRow 6: `. . . . . T 1 T . .` (y=6) \u2013 Enemy at (6,6)  \nRow 5: `. . . . . . . . . .` (y=5)  \nRow 4: `. A A . . . . . . .` (y=4)  \nRow 3: `. . . . A . . . A .` (y=3)  \nRow 2: `. . . . . . A A . .` (y=2)  \nRow 1: `. A . . . . . . A A` (y=1)  \nRow 0: `. . . . A . A A . A` (y=0)  \n`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` (x-axis)\n\n**CHECK MOVES FROM (1,8):**\n\n1. **UP to (1,9):** Row 9, x=1 is `A` \u2013 Apple! Safe? Check board: `(1,9)` is `A` (from row 9: `. A . ...` \u2013 so (1,9) is apple). Is it occupied by enemy? Enemy body is at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (6,9) \u2013 no. My body? I'm at (1,8) and my body goes to (1,7), (2,7), etc. No. So UP is safe and eats an apple! That gives me +1 apple (11 total) and grows my body (tail stays). Good.\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,7):** Row 7: `. T T T . T . T . .` \u2013 at x=1, y=7 is `T` (my body segment). (1,7) is the segment behind my head from last turn (I moved from (1,7) to (1,8) by going UP? Wait no, last move was UP from (1,7) to (1,8), so (1,7) is now my second body segment). Moving DOWN would crash into my own body. DEAD.\n\n3. **LEFT to (0,8):** Row 8: `. 0 . T . T . T T .` \u2013 at x=0, y=8 is `.` (empty). No enemy there. My body? Not at (0,8). Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2,8):** Row 8: at x=2, y=8 is `.` (empty). Safe? Check enemy body: enemy head at (6,6), body includes (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) \u2013 no (2,8). My body: not at (2,8). So safe.\n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**\n- DOWN is suicide (into my own body). \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**\n\n- **UP to (1,9):** Eats an apple immediately! (+1 point, growth). From (1,9), next moves: DOWN to (1,8) [my current position, but will be empty after I leave], LEFT to (0,9) [check row 9: x=0 is `.`, empty], RIGHT to (2,9) [row 9: x=2 is `.`? Row 9: `. A . T ...` \u2013 x=0 `.`, x=1 `A`, x=2 `.`, x=3 `T`... so (2,9) is empty]. So I have multiple options. Also, (1,9) is a corner \u2013 I can later go to (0,9) or (2,9), avoiding traps.\n\n- **LEFT to (0,8):** No apple, but positions me at left edge. From (0,8), next moves: RIGHT to (1,8) [empty], DOWN to (0,7) [row 7: x=0 is `.`? Row 7: `. T T T ...` \u2013 x=0 `.`, empty], UP to (0,9) [empty]. So also multiple options. But no immediate gain.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2,8):** No apple. From (2,8), next moves: LEFT to (1,8), UP to (2,9) [empty], DOWN to (2,7) [row 7: x=2 is `T`? Row 7: `. T T T ...` \u2013 x=1 `T`, x=2 `T` (my body?), Wait, my body: I'm at (1,8), my body is (1,7), (2,7), (3,7)... so (2,7) is my body segment. (2,8) is empty, but DOWN to (2,7) is my own body \u2013 crash if I go DOWN later. So from (2,8), DOWN is dangerous. Also, enemy might head toward (2,8) later? But not immediate.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP to (1,9):** This is the ONLY move that gives an immediate apple! I'm at 10 apples, Snake #1 at 7. Eating an apple puts me at 11, widening the lead. The apple is RIGHT THERE. The top-left corner is secure \u2013 I already own (1,8) and can take (1,9) and (0,9). This is aggressive expansion.\n\n- **LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8):** These are passive. They don't grow my snake or gain apples. They just position me while the enemy might grab apples elsewhere (e.g., enemy at (6,6) could go to (6,5) or (7,6) etc., but apples are scattered). I should be grabbing apples while I can.\n\n- **ENEMY THREAT:** Snake #1 is at (6,6) with body wrapping around. They might head toward (4,3) or (1,4) apples, but they're far. No immediate head-on collision risk \u2013 our heads are far apart (1,8 vs 6,6). But if I grow bigger, I can dominate later.\n\n- **LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab (1,9) \u2192 then (0,9) \u2192 then sweep down the left column (0,8, 0,7, 0,6...) to collect (1,4) apple on the way, while cutting off the enemy from the left side. Force enemy into bottom-right tight spaces. Aim for 20+ apples while they struggle. Keep score lead high to win final turn.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nUP to (1,9) is the best move! Immediate apple, safe, and opens up future apple grabs. It's aggressive and grows my snake. Let's gooo!\n\nUP",

Let's check the moves:\n\n**Immediate Survival Check:**\n1. **UP to (1,10):** That's outside the board (y max is 9). Dead. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (1,8):** That's my own body segment. Dead. \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (0,9):** Inside board. Check occupancy: Row 9, x=0 is '.' (empty). Not my body (my body is at (1,8), (1,7)...). Not enemy body (enemy at (6,7)...). SAFE. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (2,9):** Inside board. Row 9, x=2 is '.' (empty). Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE. \u2705\n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT are the only safe moves. We're boxed in the top row! I'm at (1,9) with UP dead and DOWN dead.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **LEFT to (0,9):** Gets me to the left corner. From there, I can go DOWN to (0,8) which is empty (row 8, x=0 is '.'). That keeps me alive and opens up the left column. I see an apple at (1,4) later - if I go down the left side, I can sweep across to grab it.\n- **RIGHT to (2,9):** Gets me to (2,9). From there, I can go DOWN to (2,8) (empty), or LEFT back to (1,9) (but that'll be my body after I move). However, (2,9) is adjacent to enemy territory - enemy has body at (3,9)? Wait, checking: Enemy body includes (3,7)? No, enemy body: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)]. So (3,9) is empty. But RIGHT puts me closer to the center where enemy is. Riskier.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (6,7) with body wrapped around top-right. They might go for apples at (9,9) or (8,3) or others. They're not immediately threatening my space.\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nI don't need to chase apples right this second - I'm dominating 11-7. But I need to stay alive and keep options open. LEFT to corner gives me a safer escape route down the left edge. RIGHT keeps me more central but might limit future moves.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGo LEFT to (0,9), then DOWN to (0,8), continue down the left column to collect (1,4) apple while boxing the enemy out of the left side. Use my growing size to dominate the board and force enemy into tight spots.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is the safer play. It gets me to a corner where I can control the left edge and maintain my lead without risking immediate collision with enemy.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I\u2019M ALL ABOUT PUSHING HIS BOUNDARIES AND LOCKING THE TOP ROW UNTIL WE FORCE A MISS.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n- Evaluate all four directions from (6,7) to see immediate die-cases (off-board, into our own body, or into the enemy body).\n- Check for head-on risk: if both heads go into same cell this turn, we both die; we\u2019ll avoid risky cross-lines.\n- Pick SAFE moves that preserve future options and move toward opportunities to pressure the enemy.\n- Prioritize moves that keep multiple follow-up options open while avoiding dead-ends.\n\nSAFE MOVES RIGHT NOW\n- UP to (6,8) is the only safe move. Down, Left, or Right all crash into our own body or into the enemy body.\n\nREASONING ON SAFE MOVE\n- Down: immediate collision with our own second segment (6,6) after the turn, so nope.\n- Left: hits opponent\u2019s body at (5,7) on contact, which is a death.\n- Right: runs into our own body at (7,7).\n- UP: clean path to (6,8) with no collisions, preserves future space.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next 2-3 turns)\n- Move UP to (6,8) now. It keeps the center open and avoids any immediate head-on risk with the distant opponent.\n- From (6,8), the only safe next move is UP to (6,9). Other directions would either hit your own body or opponent\u2019s body.\n- Once at (6,9), look to slip a safe turn to the RIGHT (to (7,9)) if the space remains free and if it doesn\u2019t trap us. It keeps pressure on the top corridor and keeps options open for contouring around his left flank without risky head-to-heads.\n- Stay aware of apple spawns; growing is secondary to pressure and survival, but every safe growth compounds future box opportunities.\n\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 11) but this top-corridor control gives us the chance to force risky moves from him or to squeeze him into a boxed trap if he overextends upward.\n- If he tries to cut across to avoid the box, we can pivot along the top band and attempt to angle him toward the edge, potentially causing a head-on if we time it right and he commits to a shared cell.\n\nFINAL MOVE JUST BEFORE LOCK\n- UP",

Checking moves:  \n- **UP to (0, 10):** Off-board\u2014dead. \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (0, 8):** Empty (board shows '.' at row 8, col 0). Not my body (my body starts at (1,9)... (5,7)).

Dead. \u274c  \n\n**Only SAFE move is DOWN.**  \n\n**Strategic Analysis:**  \n- **DOWN to (0, 8):** Keeps me alive and hugging the left edge. From (0,8), I can continue DOWN to (0,7), (0,6), etc., weaving down the left column. This avoids the enemy\u2019s current cluster in the top-right (enemy head at (6,8), body snaking down).  \n- **Apple Access:** The apple at (1,4) is reachable via a downward crawl then a right turn. I\u2019m dominating 11-7, so I don\u2019t *need* apples immediately\u2014but staying alive and controlling space is key to boxing the enemy out.  \n- **Enemy Threat:** Snake #1 is at (6,8) with body wrapping. They might chase apples at (9,9) or (8,3), but they\u2019re not in my immediate path. If they turn leftward, I\u2019ll be far enough down to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\n**Long-term Plan:**  \nContinue down the left column (0,8) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 ... until I hit (0,4), then RIGHT to (1,4) for the apple. This keeps me in a safe corridor while forcing the enemy into tighter spaces. If they try to flank, my length will dominate the board.  \n\n**Final Decision:**  \nOnly one move keeps me alive\u2014DOWN. Let\u2019s go! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nDOWN",

Safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (-1, 7):** Off-board \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 7):** That's my own body! (Body includes (1,7).)

From (0,7) down to (0,6), we're staying out of the enemy's way. Snake #1 is bunched up in the top-right (head at (7,9)), and they're not a threat yet. Since we're larger (11 vs 7), if we ever meet head-on, we win and they die\u2014so we can actually chase them down if needed. But right now, we need to secure space and maybe grab that apple at (1,4) later. We're controlling the left side, forcing them into a corner. Stay alive, stay aggressive, and wait for them to slip up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nKeep crawling down: (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) to scout for apples. Avoid the top-right chaos. If they turn left, we might head straight for a head-on collision since we have the size advantage. Let's box them in!\n\nDOWN",

We're bigger, we're bolder, and we're about to box this archrival in like it's a prison riot! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this LIVE action so we don't slip up.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**  \nCurrent head: (0, 6). Let's map out the danger zone:  \n- **UP to (0, 7):** My own body! (Body list includes (0,7) from last move.) Crashing into myself \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (0, 5):** Empty on board (row 5, col 0 is '.'). No enemy body nearby (Snake #1 is far top-right). Safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (-1, 6):** Off-board \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 6):** That's my own body! (Body includes (1,6) via (1,7) etc., but specifically (1,6) is part of the chain\u2014yep, it's occupied by my tail section.) Crashing into myself \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVE IS DOWN!** No choice here\u2014we're forced to keep crawling down the left edge to avoid suicide. Chat, we're locked in, but we're staying alive to fight another day!\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**  \nWe're at (0,6) and moving to (0,5) keeps us hugging the left wall, which is our safe zone. Snake #1 is still chilling in the top-right (head at (8,9)), probably plotting something, but they're not an immediate threat. With our size advantage (11 vs 7), if we ever get close enough for a head-on, we win and they die\u2014so we can actually pressure them later. But right now, we need to secure our space: moving down opens up a path toward potential apples like (1,4) or (2,4) in the lower-left quadrant. We're not chasing apples blindly; we're dominating the board by controlling the left side and forcing the enemy into the corner. They've got 7 apples to our 11\u2014any wrong move from them and we capitalize!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nContinue descending: (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) to scout the board's bottom edge and hook toward the apple at (1,4). Avoid the top-right mess until we've grown a bit more. If Snake #1 heads left, we go for the kill with a head-on since we're larger\u2014no mercy!

We're bigger, we're bolder, and we're about to box this archrival in like it's a prison riot! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this LIVE action so we don't slip up.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**  \nCurrent head: (0, 5). Let's map out the danger zone:  \n- **UP to (0, 6):** Empty on board (row 6, col 0 is '.'), but wait\u2014Snake #1's body includes (6,6) and (7,6), but (0,6) is far away. No immediate body collision. However, we must consider the simultaneous move\u2014enemy might move toward us. But purely for self-collision: (0,6) was our previous head position from last turn, but after we moved to (0,5), the tail moved (since we didn't eat an apple last turn), so (0,6) should now be part of our body? Let's check: Our body list: [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)]. Head is (0,5). So (0,6) is still our body! So UP to (0,6) would be moving into our own body \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (0, 4):** Empty on board (row 4, col 0 is '.'). No enemy body nearby. Safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (-1, 5):** Off-board \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 5):** Empty on board (row 5, col 1 is '.'). No enemy body. Safe! \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. No forced single option this turn!\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**  \nWe're at (0,5) on the left edge. Moving RIGHT to (1,5) opens up the board\u2014 we can head toward apples like (1,4) or (2,4) without trapping ourselves against the wall. Moving DOWN to (0,4) keeps us hugging the left wall, but that might lead to a dead end if we keep going down (the bottom row is row 0, so eventually we hit the floor). We want to keep options open for future turns. Snake #1 is at (9,9) with a body stretching down to (6,6) and right to (7,7), so they're in the top-right corner. If we move RIGHT, we can start maneuvering toward the center to potentially force a head-on collision later\u2014remember, we have more apples (11 vs 8), so if we can corner them or intercept, we win the collision!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nHead RIGHT into the board to gain space: (1,5) \u2192 then maybe (2,5) or (1,4) to snag an apple and grow. Avoid staying on the left wall forever; we need to dominate the middle and pressure Snake #1 into the top-right corner. If they chase us down, we'll force a head-on with our size advantage. Stay aggressive, keep options open, and remember: survival first, domination second.\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps you alive and close to the right edge to threaten apples later.\n\nConclusion: DOWN is the only safe, non-suicidal choice.\n\nRationale: you're boxed on the top-right with no immediate apples there. Going down preserves life, maintains pressure potential along the right edge, and keeps options open for chasing the (9,1)/(9,0) apples later while avoiding a head-on with the left-snake right now.\n\nPlan for next turns (to remind myself): stay in the rightmost corridor, aim for the bottom-right apples, and use positioning to pressure the left snake into awkward lines. only go for head-ons if you\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and can force it without risking death.\n\nDOWN",

We're bigger, we're bolder, and we're about to box this archrival in like it's a prison riot! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this LIVE action so we don't slip up.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**  \nCurrent head: (1, 5). Let's map out the danger zone:  \n- **UP to (1, 6):** Empty on board (row 6, col 1 is '.'), but check enemy body: Snake #1's body includes (6,7), (6,6), (7,6), etc. (1,6) is safe. No immediate body collision. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (1, 4):** Empty on board (row 4, col 1 is 'A'\u2014an apple!). Safe move (eating apple adds growth). \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (0, 5):** Empty on board (row 5, col 0 is 'T'\u2014wait, that's our body? Let's check: Our body includes (0,5) from the list? Actually, our body list is: [(0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8)]. Head is (1,5). So (0,5) is indeed part of our own body! Moving LEFT into (0,5) would hit our body \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Empty on board (row 5, col 2 is '.'). No enemy body. Safe! \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is dead.\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**  \nWe're at (1,5) in the lower-left quadrant. Moving DOWN to (1,4) lets us eat an apple (+1 growth, +1 score to 12, keeping our lead solid). That apple is right there\u2014why not take the free point and grow? It also positions us near more apples: (2,4), (1,1), (2,3) etc., keeping options open. Moving UP to (1,6) is safe but doesn't gain points immediately; moving RIGHT to (2,5) is safe but misses the apple below. Our plan to dominate the board means grabbing resources while staying aggressive. Snake #1 is still in the top-right corner (head at (9,8)), so we have time to control the lower-left and middle. If we eat here, we grow stronger and can later force them into a corner. Remember, we have the size advantage\u2014if they chase, we can bait a head-on collision.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nEat the apple at (1,4) now. Then from there, head toward the cluster of apples in the lower-left/middle (like (2,4), (2,3), (1,1)) to keep growing. Avoid getting trapped on edges; use our body to cut off Snake #1's escape routes if they move left. Stay alert for their next move\u2014they might try to flank us, but with our size, we can crash them if they get close. Keep options open, stay aggressive, and hunt that win!\n\nDOWN  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Among them, DOWN gives better long-term fruit access and keeps us aggressive toward the bottom-right apple pack, while still avoiding any immediate trap with the left snake.\n\nDecision: DOWN. We keep the right-edge lane, threaten the bottom-right apple cluster, and stay ready to pressure the left snake if it over-extends.

We\u2019re staring down the top-right corner, head at (9,6), and the rival is chilling on the left side at (2,4). Remember: stay alive, keep options open, and bully the board.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Immediate safeties from (9,6): \n  - UP = (9,7) hits your own neck (dead).\n  - RIGHT = (10,6) is off-board (dead).\n  - DOWN = (9,5) is free of your body and enemy\u2019s body.\n  - LEFT = (8,6) is free of bodies and on the board.\n- So we\u2019ve got two safe starts: DOWN or LEFT. Neither collides with the foe this turn, and both keep the long-term corridor open.\n\nDecision:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (8 vs 13). The plan is to edge toward the apple cluster along x = 8 (the column with apples at (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)) and maintain space to dodge the opponent. This keeps multiple escape routes and avoids caging ourselves near the top edge.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Start by sliding LEFT to (8,6). This preserves agility along the right edge and lines us up for a downward sweep through the 8th column to grab the low apples.\n- In subsequent turns, drop DOWN along the 8th column to reach (8,3)/(8,2)/(8,1) apples, growing while staying aware of the opponent\u2019s path. Avoid any moves that would push you into a trap or into the opponent\u2019s body.\n- If the opportunity arises for a favorable head-on (you have more apples), consider pressuring carefully, but right now your objective is safe growth and maintaining mobility.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Keep expanding along the 8th column to force the opponent into a predictable corridor, then pivot to minimize risk of being boxed in. Use the edge and your current body layout to deny the rival safe approaches. If you ever gain a sizable lead, you can trade risk for a controlled collision\u2014but today we grow, stay alive, and out-maneuver.\n\nFinal decision for this turn:\n- LEFT\n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re in the top-right corner, moving likely toward apples like (8,3) or (6,5).\n- They\u2019re far from us, but if they head left/down, we could cut them off. We have 5 more apples, so we can afford to be aggressive if we see an opening.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Our head: (2,4)\n- Our body: stretches from (1,4) down to (0,9), around the left edge. We\u2019re basically a wall on the left side.\n- Apples nearby: (2,3) right below us, (1,1) left-down, (4,3) up-right, (6,2) further right.\n- Key: Avoid self-crash and keep options open. We\u2019re long, so tight spaces are risky.\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (HEAD AT (2,4)):**\n- **UP (2,5):** Board shows 'T' (tree) at (2,5)? Wait, let\u2019s check the board map:\n  Row 5: \"T T . . . . A . . .\" So (2,5) is '.' (empty)? Actually, row 5 is y=5: columns 0-9. So (2,5) is column 2 row 5 \u2192 from the string \"T T . . . . A . . .\", positions: 0:T,1:T,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:.,6:A,... So yes, (2,5) is '.'. No obstacle. But is it safe from body? Our body includes (1,5) but not (2,5). Enemy? No. \u2705 Safe.\n- **DOWN (2,3):** Board row 3: \". . A . A . . . A .\" \u2192 (2,3) is 'A' (apple). Safe from collisions. \u2705 Safe + apple.\n- **LEFT (1,4):** Our previous head, now part of body? Actually (1,4) is in our body list. Moving left would move head into own body \u2192 crash. \u274c DEADLY.\n- **RIGHT (3,4):** Board row 4: \". T 0 . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (3,4) is '.' (empty). But check: our body includes (3,7) etc., not (3,4). Enemy far away. \u2705 Safe.\n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**\n- LEFT is instant death (backwards into body). We always skip that.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:**\n- UP (2,5): empty, safe. Future options: from there we can go UP to (2,6) (row 6: \"T . . . . . . . . 1\" \u2192 (2,6) is '.'), RIGHT to (3,5) (row 5: (3,5) is '.'), LEFT to (1,5) (our body? (1,5) is in body list\u2014can't go there). So UP gives us two options (UP/RIGHT) from (2,5).\n- DOWN (2,3): apple, safe. But from (2,3), options: UP back to (2,4) (our body? (2,4) will be tail after we move? Actually if we move DOWN, our head becomes (2,3), old head (2,4) becomes part of body. So moving back UP would go into our own body. \u274c). LEFT (1,3): row 3: (1,3) is '.' (from \". . A . A ...\"). RIGHT (3,3): row 3: (3,3) is '.' ( \". . A . A . . . A .\" \u2192 after (2,3)=A, (3,3)=. , (4,3)=A). So from (2,3), we have LEFT and RIGHT options, but not UP.\n- RIGHT (3,4): empty. From (3,4), options: UP (3,5) '.' (row 5), DOWN (3,3) '.' (row 3), LEFT (2,4) will be our body after move? If we move RIGHT, our head becomes (3,4), old head (2,4) becomes body. So LEFT would be into body. So we have UP and DOWN options from (3,4). Also RIGHT to (4,4) which is '.' (row 4: \". T 0 . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (4,4) is '.'). Actually wait: row 4 string: \". T 0 . . . . . . .\" So indices: 0:., 1:T, 2:0 (our previous head? Actually at turn 39 start, head is (2,4) so that's '0' in row 4 at index 2? But the board shows row 4 as \". T 0 . . . . . . .\" yes. So (4,4) is index 4: '.' after the dots. So from (3,4), RIGHT to (4,4) is also '.'.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- We\u2019re leading 13-8. We want to grow and dominate, but also force collisions if we\u2019re stronger. The enemy is far, so maybe we can cut off their apple access.\n- **Priority: Eat apples, avoid traps.** DOWN to (2,3) gives an apple instantly, increasing lead to 14-8. But from (2,3), we have limited options: LEFT and RIGHT only (UP is self-crash, DOWN is (2,2) which is '.' from row 2: \" . . . . . . A A A .\" \u2192 (2,2) is '.'? Row 2: \" . . . . . . A A A .\" Wait, the board map row 2 is \" . . . . . . A A A .\" Actually from the given board:\n  2 . . . . . . A A A .\n  So (2,2) is '.' (third character is '.'). Actually string: \". . . . . . A A A .\" Indices: 0:.,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:.,6:A,7:A,8:A,9:. So (2,2) is '.' yes. So from (2,3), DOWN to (2,2) is also '.' and safe. So actually from (2,3) we have LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN\u2014all '.'? Check (2,2) is '.' yes. So DOWN move gives us three safe follow-ups. But we have to consider future apple positioning.\n- **UP to (2,5)** doesn\u2019t get an apple but keeps us mobile. From there we can head toward (4,3) or (6,2) apples.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)** also no apple, but opens up more rightward movement, potentially toward (4,3) apple.\n\n**FORCE A HEAD-ON?** Not yet\u2014enemy is far. But if we grow, we can later challenge them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue growing while maneuvering to the center-right to cut off enemy\u2019s apple access. Watch their move\u2014if they go left/down, we can move to intercept.\n\n**CHOOSING THE BEST MOVE:**\n- DOWN gives an apple now, solidifying lead. But from (2,3), we\u2019re near the left side still, and moving DOWN might keep us in the lower-left while enemy is top-right\u2014less interaction.\n- RIGHT to (3,4) moves us toward the center, opening paths to multiple apples: (4,3) is nearby, (6,2) is reachable. It also keeps us away from our own tail for future moves.\n- UP to (2,5) is neutral.\n\n**GO FOR THE APPLE!** But wait, if we take the apple DOWN, we grow to 14, and our body length increases. That could help in a future clash. However, from (2,3), moving RIGHT to (3,3) then to (4,3) apple is two steps. Alternatively, from RIGHT start (3,4), we can go DOWN to (3,3) and then to (4,3). \n\nActually, let's think: If we go RIGHT now, we're at (3,4). Next turn, we can go DOWN to (3,3) and then possibly eat (4,3) if it's still there. But (4,3) is an apple right now. If we delay, enemy might grab it if they move toward center. But enemy is at (9,6), far away\u2014probably not an immediate threat.\n\n**SAFETY FIRST:** All moves are safe except LEFT. We need to avoid getting trapped. Our body is long on the left, so moving DOWN or RIGHT are good to expand.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** I think RIGHT is best. It moves us to the center, keeps options open for multiple apples (like (4,3) or (6,2)), and doesn't commit us to the bottom-left corner. Plus, it avoids growing immediately, which might help maneuverability (shorter tail? No, we already have 13 apples, body is long regardless). Actually, moving RIGHT doesn't eat an apple, so we stay at 13, while moving DOWN eats and grows to 14. But 14 is better for forcing head-on collisions later.\n\nWait, but the objective: \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So eating now is good. But also \"keep future options OPEN.\" From (2,3), we have three directions, but (2,3) is on the left edge\u2014still somewhat limited. From (3,4), we have more central access.\n\nLet's check apples: (2,3) is an apple, but there are other apples: (4,3), (6,2), (6,5), etc. If we eat (2,3), we might be too slow to get others. \n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** Since we're ahead, we can afford to not take the immediate apple and instead position to intercept the enemy or cut them off. But enemy is far\u2014maybe not needed yet.\n\n**RE-EXAMINE BOARD:** Row 4: \". T 0 . . . . . . .\" Our head at (2,4). Row 5: \"T T . . . . A . . .\" (2,5) is '.'; (5,5) is 'A'. Row 3: \". . A . A . . . A .\" So (2,3)=A, (3,3)=., (4,3)=A.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,4), next turn we can go DOWN to (3,3) and then RIGHT to (4,3) to eat. Or UP to (3,5) and then RIGHT to (4,5) etc.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,3), next turn we can go RIGHT to (3,3) and then to (4,3), or DOWN to (2,2) (which is '.'), etc.\n\nActually, going RIGHT now might be slightly faster to (4,3) because from (3,4) we can go DOWN+RIGHT to (4,3) in two moves? From (3,4) DOWN to (3,3) then RIGHT to (4,3). From (2,3) RIGHT to (3,3) then RIGHT to (4,3). Same two moves.\n\nBut from (2,3), if we go DOWN to (2,2), we can go RIGHT to (3,2) etc.\n\n**DECISION:** I'll go RIGHT to position centrally, and plan to eat (4,3) soon. This also avoids growing immediately, which might help if we need to make sharp turns later (though snake length doesn't affect turning, it's about avoiding body).\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** Plan to move DOWN to (3,3) and then eat (4,3) apple. Watch enemy\u2014if they move left, prepare to cut off their path with our size.\n\nChat, let\u2019s go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Time to execute our plan and cut them off! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**ENEMY CHECK:** Snake #1 head at (8,6) with body along the top-right edge. They're probably eyeing apples like (6,5) or (8,3). If they head left/down, we need to be ready to block. We have the length advantage, so we can be aggressive if we see an opening.\n\n**BOARD STATE:** Our head at (3,4) after last move (RIGHT). Body stretches from (2,4) down to (0,9) on the left. Apples nearby: (4,3) up-right, (6,2) further right, (6,5) north-east, (2,3) below (but we passed it). We're positioned centrally now\u2014perfect for controlling the board!\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (HEAD AT (3,4)):**\n- **UP (3,5):** Row 5: \"T T . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 (3,5) is '.' (empty).

Safe from body (our body is at (3,7) etc.) and enemy. \u2705\n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY:** LEFT is instant death\u2014never backwards into self!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe. Now, which gives us the best position?\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:** We need to grow and dominate! (4,3) apple is just two moves away: DOWN to (3,3) then RIGHT to (4,3). But let's think ahead:\n- If we go DOWN now to (3,3), next turn we can EAT (4,3) apple and grow to 14. From there, we'd have options: UP (4,4), LEFT (3,3) would be body, RIGHT (5,3) which is '.' (row 3: (5,3) is '.'), DOWN (4,2) which is '.' (row 2: (4,2) is '.'). So multiple exits!\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,4), we're closer to (4,3) too (just DOWN next turn). But (4,4) is empty\u2014no immediate apple. However, it opens up RIGHT to (5,4) and UP to (4,5), giving more flexibility.\n- If we go UP to (3,5), we're near (6,5) apple but further from (4,3). Might be slower to grow.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** We're ahead\u2014can we force a head-on collision later? Not yet; enemy is far. But we should grow while positioning to cut off their apple access. (4,3) apple is prime real estate\u2014if we take it, we claim the center.\n\n**SAFETY & OPTIONS:** DOWN gives us an apple next move while keeping multiple paths. RIGHT also keeps us mobile. UP is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Since we're playing to grow and dominate, I'm choosing DOWN to set up eating (4,3) next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next move: eat (4,3) apple. Then move toward (6,2) or (6,5) to control central-right area. Watch enemy\u2014if they head left, use our length to block their escape. Keep the lead growing!\n\n**CHAT, LET'S GO!** DOWN for the setup! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re playing smart, aggressive, and slippery.\n\nShort-term plan: MOVE DOWN now to chase apples at (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) while staying clear of the rival\u2019s lane on the left.\n\nWhy DOWN? It keeps options open, avoids the left-side trap, and lines up multiple future grabs in the right column. RIGHT is blocked by our body; UP risks the top edge; LEFT delays growth but stays safe.\n\nLonger-term note: If we ever build a lead, we can press for a controlled collision\u2014until then, we farm safely and stay mobile.\n\nStay aware of (3,4) and watch for head-on chances that we can exploit without getting boxed in.\ndown",

Let's keep the pressure on and box that snake #1 in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**ENEMY CHECK:** Snake #1 head at (8,4) with body from (8,5) to (7,9). They're probably trying to escape the top-right corner or go for apples like (9,3) or (8,3). Their body blocks most of the top, but they might move DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4). If they go DOWN into (8,3), that's an apple\u2014let's see if we can block or force a collision later.\n\n**BOARD STATE:** Our head at (4,3) after last move RIGHT (we ate the apple! Score is now 14-8!). Body stretches left and up: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7)]. We're centered but a bit stretched. Apples nearby: (6,5) up-right, (6,2) down-right, (2,3) down-left, (7,2) down-right, (8,3) down-right (enemy might grab it), (9,3) far right. We need to stay mobile and aggressive.\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (HEAD AT (4,3)):**\n- **UP (4,4):** Row 4: \". T T T . . . . 1 .\" \u2192 (4,4) is 'T' (our own body at (3,4)? Wait, body list shows (3,4) is directly below (4,4)? Actually, (4,4) is empty? Wait, board shows Row 4: \". T T T . . . . 1 .\" meaning column 4 (x=4,y=4) is '.'? Let's parse: Row 4: columns 0 to 9: 0:'.', 1:'T', 2:'T', 3:'T', 4:'.', 5:'.', 6:'.', 7:'.', 8:'1', 9:'.' So (4,4) is '.' (empty). But wait, our body has (3,4) which is x=3,y=4\u2014adjacent. But (4,4) itself is not in our body list. Check: Body includes (3,4), (2,4), etc.\u2014no (4,4). So UP is empty. But is there an enemy body? Enemy body is at (8,5) etc.\u2014not at (4,4). So UP seems safe. However, we must consider if we move into our own body *including backwards*\u2014but (4,4) is not behind our head. Our head at (4,3), moving UP to (4,4)\u2014not our body. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN (4,2):** Row 2: \". . . . . . A A A .\" \u2192 (4,2) is '.' (empty). Safe from body and enemy. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT (3,3):** Row 3: \". . A . A . . . A A\" \u2192 (3,3) is 'A'? Wait, row 3: columns 0:'.',1:'.',2:'A',3:'.',4:'A',5:'.',6:'.',7:'.',8:'A',9:'A'? Actually, board row 3: \". . A . A . . . A A\" so (3,3) is '.'? Wait, let's count: position 0:'.', 1:'.', 2:'A', 3:'.', 4:'A', 5:'.', 6:'.', 7:'.', 8:'A', 9:'A'. So (3,3) is column 3, which is '.' (empty). But check body: Our body includes (3,3) from previous head? Actually, after moving RIGHT, our old head (3,3) becomes part of body. Yes! In our body list: after eating, body now includes (3,3) as the first body segment. So (3,3) is now occupied by our own body! Moving LEFT into (3,3) would crash into our own body. \u274c DEADLY.\n- **RIGHT (5,3):** Row 3: \"(3,3) is '.'? Wait, (5,3) column 5: from row 3: columns: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'A',3:'.',4:'A',5:'.',6:'.',7:'.',8:'A',9:'A'. So (5,3) is '.' (empty). Safe from body and enemy. \u2705 SAFE.\n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY:** LEFT is instant death because (3,3) is now our body.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT. All lead to empty cells.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:** We need to stay aggressive and block enemy. Right now, UP to (4,4) keeps us near center and opens paths to (6,5) or (6,2). RIGHT to (5,3) moves toward (6,2) apple and (7,2). DOWN to (4,2) is safe but leads to nothing immediate\u2014might get us trapped. UP seems best for positioning to dominate the board and potentially cut off snake #1 if they move down. Also, UP avoids moving directly toward their possible path (if they go LEFT or DOWN). Let's go UP!\n\n**CHAT, LET'S GO!** UP to stay mobile and plan the next strike! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

But wait\u2014our body includes (4,3) from last move? Yes! After moving UP to (4,4), our old head (4,3) became part of body. So (4,3) is now occupied by our own body.

Could open paths to (6,5) next turn or cut off enemy if they go down. But we're heading near our own tail? No, tail is at (2,7), not blocking.  \n- **RIGHT to (5,4):** Moves toward (6,2) and (7,2) apples, which are closer to enemy territory. This puts us in position to challenge snake #1 if they go DOWN to (8,2). RIGHT keeps us in the middle row, avoiding the top where enemy body is dense. Also, RIGHT is safer long-term because it moves away from our tail and toward more open space on the right side (rows 2-4 have fewer obstacles).  \n\nWe need to box snake #1 in\u2014RIGHT gets us closer to their potential path. Let's go RIGHT and plan to push toward (6,2) or (7,2) next turn to force them into a corner. CHAT, LET'S AGGRESS! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT, then target (6,2) or (7,2) apple. If snake #1 goes DOWN, we can cut them off. If they go LEFT, we chase. Stay alive and grow to dominate the board!  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe and tasty. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- Why I\u2019m leaning DOWN:\n  - It eats the apple at (8,2) this turn, growing me and expanding my reach toward the dense apple cluster on y=2. More apples = more swing and control later.\n  - It keeps me on a slightly lower, more open plane where I won\u2019t trap myself in a tight corner against my own body.\n  - I\u2019m behind the opponent (9 vs 14). Pushing into their flank now would be risky head-on with less payoff. Better to secure growth and keep lanes open.\n\n- Short-term rabbit hole plan:\n  - Continue to chase the y=2 apples (6,2), (7,2), (8,2) as they appear. Build length and momentum.\n  - Avoid turning back into my own neck or lining up a dead-end against the left wall; preserve multiple escape routes.\n  - If the opponent missteps toward the center, pressure from the right and try to force a boxed situation rather than a direct head-on.\n\n- Long-term vibe:\n  - Grow steady, keep space between me and the opponent, and be ready to pivot to any open lane that snakes us into a favorable clash. The goal is to flip the apples lead and make the opponent chase shadows while I stack bodies and space.\n\nFinal move plan: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Body now: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]. They're squeezing into the bottom-right corner.

If they go LEFT to (7,2), we can collide head-on if we're at (6,2) or (7,2) next turn. Let's anticipate!\n\n**OUR STATE:** Head at (5,4) after last RIGHT move.

We need to close in on enemy territory!\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (HEAD AT (5,4)):**\n- **UP (5,5):** Row 5: \"T T . . . . A . T .\" \u2192 (5,5) is '.' (empty). Body? No (5,5) in list. Enemy?

Might get us closer to top-right, but enemy body blocks column 9 at y=6-9. Not ideal for boxing them in. We want to squeeze them DOWN, not UP.\n- **DOWN to (5,3):** Direct path to apple at (6,2) or (7,2). This heads toward enemy's current head level (y=2). If we go DOWN now, we set up for a head-on collision next turn if enemy goes LEFT to (7,2). Our head at (5,3) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (7,3) could chase them into corner. Also, (5,3) is closer to open space on the right. We grow faster this way\u2014dominance! \ud83d\udd25\n- **RIGHT to (6,4):** Sideways move, keeps us central but doesn't aggressively close the gap. We'd need two turns to reach apple at (6,2), losing momentum. Not our style.\n\n**DECISION:** GO DOWN! We're hunting. If enemy goes DOWN to (8,1) to eat apple, we follow toward (6,2). If enemy goes LEFT to (7,2), we can potentially head-on at (7,2) if we move DOWN then RIGHT next turn\u2014win with higher score! We're up 4 apples, forcing collision favors us. CHAT, LET'S BE RUTHLESS! We're boxing them in from the side! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (5,3). Next turn, aim for (6,2) apple and cut off enemy's escape.

Let\u2019s tighten the plan and push to break the tie.\n\nDecision process (THINKING ALOUD)\n- Safe moves from (8,2):\n  - UP: (8,3) is in my own neck yes, immediate death. Not safe. \ud83d\udeab\n  - DOWN: (8,1) is an apple and free. Safe, tasty, and moves me toward the bottom apples. \ud83c\udf4e\n  - LEFT: (7,2) is free and also has an apple on board. Safe and starts carving a path along the y=2 cluster. \ud83c\udf4e\n  - RIGHT: (9,2) is free, no apple right now, but it\u2019s a bit more neutral and exposes me to tighter corners later. Safe but not as juicy immediately.\n- Why I\u2019m leaning LEFT (turn 44 choice):\n  - It eats the apple at (7,2) this turn, growing me and pushing toward the dense apple lane along y=2 (with (6,2) nearby). More growth = more reach in future moves.\n  - It preserves open escape routes while steering me away from the current bottom-right edge where a trap could pop up.\n  - I\u2019m behind on score (10 vs 14). Pushing into their flank now with a growing body can give me options to box or threaten a controlled clash later, rather than risking a reckless head-on chase.\n- Short-term risk check:\n  - Left to (7,2) is safe; no one\u2019s blocking that path this turn, and I\u2019ll eat immediately.\n  - Down to (8,1) also safe and apple, but I\u2019d be chasing the same single apple line rather than starting a little corridor with multiple options.\n\nChosen move for turn 44: LEFT\n- Why not DOWN? It\u2019s solid and apple-rich, but LEFT gives me a longer-term ladder toward multiple apples on y=2 and creates more space to maneuver around the opponent. It also keeps a potential box-building trajectory open rather than committing me to the bottom edge too soon.\n\nLong-term plan (to be remembered for the next turns)\n- Build length along the y=2 corridor by hitting (7,2) this turn, then (6,2) if the apple is still there next turn, then pivot to (6,3) or (5,2) to threaten cross-traffic against the opponent\u2019s flank.\n- Maintain two or three safe escape routes at all times (avoid hugging a wall with no exit). If the opponent heads into your lane, pivot toward the opposite direction to avoid a head-on collision unless you\u2019re confident you can win the trade with more apples.\n- Keep the pressure on the center lanes and force the opponent to chase unpredictable lines rather than straight-on brawls. If an opportunity to force a head-on arises and I\u2019m up in apples, I\u2019ll take it; otherwise I\u2019ll keep growing and weaving to trap them with space.\n- Monitor the apple flow; keep eating to extend the chain, and try to outgrow the opponent before the final turns.\n\nFinal move cue\nLEFT",

Let's force a mistake and end this!\n\n**ENEMY CHECK:** Snake #1 head at (7,2). Body: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9)]. They're squeezed in the bottom-right. Possible moves: LEFT to (6,2) (apple at (6,2)!), DOWN to (7,1) (empty), RIGHT to (8,2) (blocked by own body). If they go LEFT to (6,2), they eat and grow\u2014we could chase. If they go DOWN, we can cut them off. No head-on immediate threat unless we move into their space.\n\n**OUR STATE:** Head at (5,3) after last DOWN. Body: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)]. We're long, blocking top-left, but head is central. Apples nearby: (6,2) down-right (enemy bait), (6,5) up-right, (9,3) far right. We need to advance toward enemy territory!\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (HEAD AT (5,3)):**\n- **UP (5,4):** Row 4: \". T T T T T . . . T .\" \u2192 (5,4) is 'T' (our own body\u2014right above head). Moving UP hits ourselves! \u274c DEADLY.\n- **DOWN (5,2):** Row 2: \". . . . . . A 1 T .\" \u2192 (5,2) is '.' (empty). Body? No. Enemy? No (enemy at (7,2), not (5,2)). \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT (4,3):** Row 3: \". . A T T 0 . . . A A\" \u2192 (4,3) is 'T' (our own body\u2014just left of head). Moving LEFT hits ourselves! \u274c DEADLY.\n- **RIGHT (6,3):** Row 3: \". . A T T 0 . . . A A\" \u2192 (6,3) is '.' (empty). Body? No. Enemy? No. \u2705 SAFE.\n\nELIMINATED: UP and LEFT are instant death. Only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\n- **DOWN to (5,2):** This heads straight toward enemy's level (y=2) and the apple at (6,2). If enemy goes LEFT to (6,2) to eat, we can follow next turn to (5,2)\u2192(6,2) and maybe collide if they stay there\u2014head-on favors us with higher score! If enemy goes DOWN, we can trap them in corner by moving RIGHT next. This move keeps us aggressive and closes the vertical gap. \ud83d\udd25\n- **RIGHT to (6,3):** Sideways toward center, but doesn't directly challenge enemy. It's safer for now but slower for boxing them in. We lose momentum chasing apples like (6,2) or (9,3). Not ruthless enough.\n\n**DECISION:** GO DOWN! We're diving into the fray. Chat, we're setting up for a potential head-on if they snag that apple\u2014win with 14 vs 11! If they dodge, we cut off their left escape. No mercy, we dominate the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (5,2). Next, chase enemy toward the bottom-right corner. If they grow, we match and force collision. Stay alive, eat if safe, and box them in by turn 50. Watch for traps in column 8!\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m reading the board like a laser, watching that enemy head at (5,3) and we\u2019re currently at (7,2) with a tasty line of apples just ahead. Let\u2019s lock this in and box him in with smarts, growth, and a little bite.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n1) Evaluate all four directions from (7,2):\n   - UP to (7,3): clean, no own body in the way; no apple here.\n   - DOWN to (7,1): clean, no apple here.\n   - LEFT to (6,2): has an apple; safe; starts stacking into the y=2 corridor toward several nearby apples.\n   - RIGHT to (8,2): would smack into my own neck (\u6b7b), not safe.\n2) Eliminate dead moves: UP, DOWN are safe but give no immediate growth; RIGHT is illegal. So we have three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n3) Pick the move that keeps multiple safe follow-ups, grows now, and keeps future boxes open against the opponent.\n\nCHOOSEN MOVE: LEFT (to 6,2)\n- Why LEFT:\n  - It eats the apple at 6,2 this turn, growing us now and extending our reach into the dense y=2 apple lane for the next turns.\n  - It starts building a corridor that can help us swing around the opponent\u2019s flank and threaten forcing a boxed sequence later, rather than running into a straight chase.\n  - It keeps multiple safe escape routes open (not hugging a wall with no exit) and doesn\u2019t stalemate us on the bottom edge.\n- Short-term risk: minimal\u2014(6,2) is free of the enemy\u2019s body and will grant a growth boost, which we want to close the apple gap.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (to keep for next turns)\n- After the grow to (6,2), look to continue along the y=2 corridor toward (6,3) or pivot toward (5,2) to threaten cross-traffic against the opponent at (5,3).\n- Maintain 2\u20133 safe exits at all times; avoid getting boxed into a corner by choosing routes that let you slip around if the enemy pivots.\n- If the opponent tries to collide into your lane, pivot to the opposite side to avoid a risky head-on\u2014only take a head-on if you have the apples to win that exchange.\n- Stay aggressive but smart: keep growing to extend reach, and clamp down on space when you can safely force a clash only if you\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nFinal move cue\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s think this out loud and keep the box potential open.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n- Evaluate from (6,2): \n  - UP -> (6,3): safe, keeps us Centered, heads toward the vertical apple lane.\n  - DOWN -> (6,1): safe, towards bottom apples, but a bit more exposed to edge.\n  - LEFT -> (5,2): moves into the opponent\u2019s head cell; risky\u2014could lead to a head-on or trap if he doesn\u2019t move.\n  - RIGHT -> (7,2): would smack into your own neck (dead). Not allowed.\n- Eliminate obvious fatal options: RIGHT is out. LEFT is risky (depends on opponent\u2019s move), so the clean play is UP or DOWN.\n- Preference given to options that keep multiple safe follow-ups and push toward available apples while avoiding a forced head-on now (we\u2019re behind on apples, so avoid reckless head-ons).\n\nCHOOSEN MOVE\n- UP (to 6,3)\n- Why UP:\n  - Safe from immediate collision with your own body.\n  - Keeps you in a flexible central corridor, not wedging you into a corner.\n  - Drives you toward the apple at (6,5) to keep growing and close the apple gap.\n  - Gives you multiple escape options if the enemy pivots, increasing your chances to box later rather than get boxed now.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Turn 46: Move UP to (6,3).\n- Turns 47\u201348: Continue UP toward (6,5) to grab that apple and grow; keep eyes on enemy at (5,2).\n- After growth, look to pin the opponent by using the vertical lane at x=6 to create spacing between you and his neck, then pressure the left side when safe.\n- If the enemy darts toward your lane, pivot to the side that keeps you with at least two safe exits and avoids a trap near the wall. Don\u2019t chase a risky head-on unless you\u2019re in a clear apple lead.\n\nFINAL MOVE\nUP",
