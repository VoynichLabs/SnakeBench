This is a clean slate, but we gotta be smart about our opening moves.\n\nLet me check our options:\n- UP would take us to (5,9) - that's the top wall! We'd be dead instantly. \u274c\n- DOWN would take us to (5,7) - that's safe! \u2705\n- LEFT would take us to (4,8) - also safe! \u2705\n- RIGHT would take us to (6,8) - safe too! \u2705\n\nSo UP is immediately out. Now we gotta think strategically. Our rival is at (2,6) - pretty far from us right now. No immediate threat of collision.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (7,6) which is actually pretty accessible if we go RIGHT first, then DOWN. But more importantly - we need to establish board control early!\n\nHere's my thought process: \n1. We're currently on the right side of the board\n2. Our rival is on the left side\n3. Going DOWN (to 5,7) keeps us central and gives us flexibility\n4. From there we can pivot LEFT toward the action or RIGHT to claim territory\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. If we go LEFT to (4,8), we're moving toward the center and potentially cutting off our rival's access to the middle. That's some aggressive positioning right there!\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since we both have zero apples and zero body segments, this is all about who can establish dominance first. The apple at (7,6) is calling our name, but we need to be smart about approach vectors.\n\nI'm feeling a LEFT move to (4,8). It's safe, it's toward the center action, and it sets us up for future plays. Plus, if our rival decides to come our way, we'll be ready to box them in!\n\nLEFT",

Phew. \ud83d\ude05\n- Check each option:\n  * UP -> (2,7): safe, keeps space, nudges toward apples at (2,9). Good for mobility.\n  * DOWN -> (2,5): apple! Instant grow +1 point if we take it. Tempting, but it doesn\u2019t get us closer to the enemy immediately.\n  * LEFT -> (1,6): safe, conservative; keeps lots of escape room to the left half of the board.\n  * RIGHT -> (3,6): safe and the most aggressive. Moves us toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant (we can pressure from below/left), while keeping multiple escape options (up/down/left next turn).\n\nRisk assessment vs foe (5,8):\n- They are two columns to our right and two rows up. They can\u2019t head-on us this turn if we move RIGHT (no shared target). We\u2019re not forcing a risky one-turn head-on \u2014 we\u2019re setting up pressure.\n- We don\u2019t have a score advantage yet, so we shouldn\u2019t recklessly suicide for a draw. We should close distance, control space, and be ready to cut him off if he overcommits.\n\nShort-term plan / notes for next turns:\n- Push RIGHT to start closing the gap and threaten to box him toward the top-right apple cluster. If he drops down toward y=7 or y=6, pivot to cut him off and force him into cramped apples or a collision.\n- If he ignores direct engagement, we can swing for apples on his side to gain a score edge, then force head-on when we have the advantage.\n- Prioritize space control and keep at least two safe follow-up moves each turn \u2014 don\u2019t get funneled into a corner.\n\nI want him cramped, I want him panicking, and I want those apples when they help me dominate.

Enemy head (4,8). Both snakes length 1, scores tied 0\u20130. All four immediate moves are alive, but we gotta pick the one that keeps options open and avoids tempting a risky head\u2011on while we\u2019re tied.\n\nMove analysis:\n- UP -> (3,7): safe. Keeps multiple follow-ups (up, left, right, back down), approaches the enemy without lining up directly under him. Good control move.\n- DOWN -> (3,5): safe but drifts away from enemy and central control \u2014 more passive.\n- LEFT -> (2,6): safe, gains space leftward but slows pressure.\n- RIGHT -> (4,6): safe and aggressive (moves toward him). Downside: it lines us directly beneath him (same x), which increases the chance of a head\u2011on next turn if we push up and he pushes down. With scores tied, don\u2019t risk an avoidable double KO.\n\nRisk assessment: opponent most likely moves for the nearby apple at (4,7) (DOWN) or tries to maneuver for top-right apples. If we go RIGHT now we directly invite a head\u2011on gamble next turn. We\u2019re not leading on apples, so avoid forcing a 50/50.\n\nDecision \u2014 short term plan (for next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move UP to (3,7) to close vertically while keeping lateral wiggle room.\n- If opponent drops to (4,7) for the apple, we can pivot to contest from the side (RIGHT then UP) or pressure from above depending on how he responds \u2014 but only force head\u2011on if we have an apple advantage.\n- Prioritize keeping 2+ safe follow-ups and baiting him into cramped movement around the apple cluster at top-right. Grow when it gives territorial advantage, not just for the point.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

You asked for the thought process, so let\u2019s break it down fast and clean.\n\nCurrent quick facts:\n- Our head: (3,7) \u2014 length 1, apples 0.\n- Enemy head: (4,7) with body at (4,8) \u2014 length >=2, apples 1.\n- Turn: 2. We are trailing 0\u20131. Don\u2019t force a 50/50 head\u2011on unless we have the edge. Capiche?\n\nConsider all 4 moves from (3,7):\n\nUP -> (3,8)\n- Safe: (3,8) is empty.\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups (UP to 3,9, LEFT to 2,8, RIGHT to 4,8 if it clears later, DOWN back).\n- Pressures vertically and keeps lateral wiggle room \u2014 doesn\u2019t line us directly under the enemy\u2019s head column. Good control move to avoid head\u2011on risk while still closing space.\n- Aggressive-but-responsible play: bait them into making a mistake near their body at (4,8).\n\nDOWN -> (3,6)\n- Safe.\n- More passive \u2014 moves away from the opponent and the apple-heavy top half. Keeps space but cedes initiative. Not ideal when we want to pressure.\n\nLEFT -> (2,7)\n- Safe.\n- Moves toward some nearby top-left apples and can start cutting off leftward escape routes.\n- Slightly more committing to the left side; still okay but less immediately pressuring than UP.\n\nRIGHT -> (4,7)\n- Technically safe this turn (it\u2019s the enemy\u2019s current head cell and they must vacate), but it lines us up directly in the same column as them and increases the risk of a head\u2011on or being forced into a cramped fight next turn.\n- Since we are trailing on apples (0 vs 1), we should avoid inviting a risky head\u2011on. Don\u2019t trade our life for a stalemate.\n\nEliminate: None of these are instant-death moves this turn, but RIGHT is the riskiest for future head\u2011on scenarios given the score disadvantage.\n\nDecision: GO UP. \ud83d\udd3c\nWhy? It keeps multiple safe follow-ups, preserves lateral movement options, applies pressure without forcing a 50/50, and positions us to influence the top half where apples and cramped movement are incoming. We stay unpredictable and ready to pounce if the rival blunders into a trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Keep pressuring the enemy\u2019s space while avoiding direct head-on trades \u2014 bait them toward the cluster of apples/top edge.\n- If they overcommit and we can safely force a head\u2011on while ahead on apples, take it. Until then, grow only when it gives a territory advantage.\n- Maintain at least 2 viable escape options each turn. Punish their mistakes, and don\u2019t be the one making them.\n\nFinal move:\nUP",

Illegal (would be a backward move). \u270b\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) = empty, legal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) = empty, legal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) = empty, legal.\n\nEnemy read:\n- Opponent head at (4,4). Their legal moves this turn: UP to (4,5), LEFT to (3,4), or RIGHT to (5,4). They cannot go DOWN (into their neck).\n- They have more apples (3 vs our 1). That means we must AVOID forcing a head\u2011on collision \u2014 a mutual kill gives them the win. We should be aggressive but smart: corral, don\u2019t suicide.\n\nWhy LEFT (4,6) \u2014 the call:\n- It continues pressure toward their x-column (we\u2019re lining up above them at x=4). That\u2019s the fastest way to start compressing their vertical options and box them toward the left/bottom wall.\n- Keeps multiple safe follow-ups from (4,6): UP (4,7), LEFT (3,6), DOWN (4,5). We still have escape routes and flexibility.\n- It doesn\u2019t move into any cell the opponent can simultaneously move into this turn, so no immediate head\u2011on risk.\n- Keeps us close to intercepting any greedy apple grabs they try (we can drop down next turns to hem them in), while preserving options to pivot if they try to flee right.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (4,6). Read their response:\n  - If they go RIGHT or LEFT (away), pivot DOWN and chase to force them toward the wall.\n  - If they go UP to (4,5) trying to climb, DO NOT suicide into (4,5). Instead keep lateral pressure (LEFT or UP) to cut escape lanes and wait for them to overcommit. We only force a head-on if we flip the apple lead \u2014 otherwise we bait and trap.\n- Don\u2019t chase apples blindly \u2014 use growth to dominate space and build a wall between them and the center.\n\nLET\u2019S SQUEEZE \u2014 keep your head, press the flap, and we box him. \ud83e\uddbe\n\nLEFT",
