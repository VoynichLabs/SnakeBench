No body segments yet, so no risk of hitting ourselves. Apples are scattered but we're ignoring them for now? Nah, we'll keep them in mind for growth, but priority is positioning against the rival.\n\nFirst, check all four moves from (7,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7,3). Inside board? Yes. Into my own body? No. Into enemy body? No (enemy body is empty). Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,1). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,2). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,2). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves from (3,1). He can go UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), RIGHT to (4,1). \n\nWe want to avoid a head-on collision this turn \u2014 that's both dead since same length. Also want to avoid moving into a cell he might move into if he has longer body later, but right now lengths equal.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to control center, cut off his movement, maybe try to trap him against walls or our own growing body. He's on left side, we're on right. I want to close the distance but not recklessly. Maybe move toward him while staying flexible.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,2), that's toward him horizontally. But also puts me closer to center. UP to (7,3) moves away from him but toward some apples (A at (7,0) is down though). Hmm.\n\nActually, let's think about future safe moves: From (7,3), next turn I'd have UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT mostly free unless he gets in the way. From (6,2), similar. \n\nBut wait \u2014 aggressive play: If I go LEFT to (6,2) and he goes RIGHT to (4,1), we're getting closer but not colliding yet. Could set up a future pin. I like that.\n\nAlso, apples at (8,5), (6,5), (4,5) are up and left-ish. Moving LEFT then UP later could grab one.\n\nChat, I'm thinking **LEFT** to start closing the gap, take space, and keep options open. Let's do it.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Advance toward enemy while growing with apples when safe. Try to get longer than him so we can force a head-on collision win. Watch his moves and anticipate.\n\nLEFT",

We're at (3,1) and our archrival is chilling at (7,2) - they're probably thinking they own the right side of the board, right? WRONG! \ud83d\ude24 \n\nCheck out the apple layout - there's a GOLDMINE at the bottom! We've got apples at (3,0) and (2,0) just WAITING for us to snack on them! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e Meanwhile, what does the enemy have near them? (7,0) is down there but they're two moves away from it, plus they'd have to commit hard to the bottom.\n\nSo what's the play here? We could go UP toward that juicy column of apples at x=3... BUT WHY WAIT FOR LATER WHEN WE CAN EAT NOW? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nIf we drop DOWN to (3,0), we grab that apple immediately - that's +1 score and we GROW! \ud83d\udcc8 Then next turn we swing LEFT to (2,0) and grab THAT apple too! Two apples in two turns while the enemy is still figuring out which way to face! \n\nIs there any risk? Pfft, the enemy is at (7,2) - they're like four cells away! Even if they book it left, they can't stop us from securing this bottom-left territory. And once we have length and control down here? We start working up that x=3 column (look at all those A's at (3,3), (3,5), (3,6), (3,8)!) and then we CUT ACROSS to box them in! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Grab (3,0) now, then immediately take (2,0) next turn. Build length on the bottom, then claim the x=3 apple highway. Keep eyes on enemy - if they move toward center, prepare to cut them off. If they stay right, dominate left and force them into a corner!

We need to catch up and pressure him!\n\nFirst, check all moves from (6,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,3). Inside board? Yes. Into my body? No body. Into enemy body? Enemy body is at (3,1) \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,1). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,2). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,2). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about enemy's possible moves from (3,0). He can go UP to (3,1) \u2014 that's his own body segment, so he can't go UP (that's suicide). He can go DOWN to (3,-1) \u2014 off board, so no. He can go LEFT to (2,0) \u2014 safe. He can go RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 safe.\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0). Good info!\n\nNow, do any of my moves risk a head-on collision this turn?  \nIf I go LEFT to (5,2), he goes LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7,2), same.  \nUP/DOWN also fine.\n\nBut long-term: He's trapped against the bottom wall with his body blocking UP. If he moves LEFT or RIGHT, he's still on y=0 next turn. We want to get longer than him to force a win. Apples nearby: (6,5) above, (4,5) up-left, (8,5) up-right.\n\nI think we should move **UP** toward those apples to grow safely while he's stuck low. Once we're longer, we can hunt him down. If we go DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT we stay low and maybe miss growth opportunities.\n\nAlso, moving UP to (6,3) gives me future options UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN next turn \u2014 keeps flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Grab an apple ASAP to match his length, then cut off his escape along the bottom wall. He can only move left/right on y=0 for now \u2014 we can try to get above him and trap him.\n\nUP",

We need to close that gap FAST and start pressuring!\n\nFirst, check all moves from (6,3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,4). Inside board? Yes. Into my body? No body. Into enemy body? Enemy body at (3,0), (3,1) \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,2). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,3). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,3). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four are safe immediately. But we gotta think about enemy's possible moves from (2,0). He can go UP to (2,1) \u2014 safe. He can go DOWN to (2,-1) \u2014 off board, no. He can go LEFT to (1,0) \u2014 safe. He can go RIGHT to (3,0) \u2014 that's his own body segment, so no.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP to (2,1), LEFT to (1,0).\n\nNow, do any of my moves risk a head-on collision this turn?  \nIf I go LEFT to (5,3), he's at (2,0) moving to (2,1) or (1,0) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7,3), same. UP/DOWN also fine.\n\nBut long-term: He's still trapped low, but now he can move UP to (2,1). We need to grow ASAP. Apples nearby: (6,5) two up, (4,5) up-left, (8,5) up-right, (3,5) left-up, (6,8) far up.\n\nI think we should move **UP** again toward the apples. Going to (6,4) puts us closer to (6,5) and keeps options open. If we go left/right, we're just moving sideways while he might start climbing.\n\nAlso, moving UP keeps us centered and gives future flexibility. We can't let him get more apples and extend his lead!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Grab the apple at (6,5) in two turns if safe. Watch enemy's move \u2014 if he goes UP to (2,1), we might need to cut him off from the apples on the left side (like (3,5), (4,5)). Once we match his length, we can force head-on collisions since we'll be longer.\n\nUP",

He's still longer (length 3 vs our length 2). Gotta play smart and aggressive!\n\nFirst, check our head at (6,5). Our body is at (6,4). Enemy head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (2,0).\n\n**Immediate safety check for each move:**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,6). Inside board? Yes. Into my body? No. Into enemy body? Enemy body at (2,1), (2,0) \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,4). That's our own body segment! \u274c **DEATH MOVE.** Eliminated.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,5). Inside board? Yes. Not our body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,5). Inside board? Yes. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Now, enemy's possible moves from (3,1):**\nHe can go UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0) \u2014 that's empty? Wait, his body is at (2,0) and (2,1). (3,0) is free. So DOWN is safe for him. LEFT to (2,1) is his own body segment \u2014 \u274c no. RIGHT to (4,1) is safe. So his safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**\nIf I go UP to (6,6), he's not going there. LEFT to (5,5) or RIGHT to (7,5) \u2014 he's far away. So no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**But think about NEXT turn safety and aggression!**\nWe want to grow and pressure. Apples nearby: (6,8) is up and right, (4,5) is two left, (8,5) is two right, (3,5) is three left, (4,4) is two left and one down.\n\nEnemy is likely heading UP toward (3,3) or (4,4) apples. We need to cut him off from the left-side apple cluster!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,5), we're closer to (4,5) and (4,4). That threatens to block his path. If we go RIGHT to (7,5), we're moving away from that cluster \u2014 not ideal. UP to (6,6) takes us toward (6,8) but away from the main fight.\n\nWe're shorter, so we can't force a head-on yet. We need another apple FAST.\n\n**Future mobility check:**\nFrom (5,5): possible next moves? UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves into them. Good options.\nFrom (6,6): UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 also good.\nFrom (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5) \u2014 also fine.\n\nBut the **aggressive play** is LEFT toward the apple cluster and to intercept enemy's path. He might go UP to (3,2) this turn, then next turn to (3,3) for the apple. If we go LEFT to (5,5), next turn we could go LEFT again to (4,5) to grab that apple and get in his way!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT now, then next turn if safe, grab (4,5) apple. That would tie us at 2 apples each, length 3 vs 3. Then we can start forcing head-on collisions! We'll be positioned between him and the other apples (3,5), (4,4).

You want us to pull an uno reverse card straight into our own body? That's instant death, instant embarrassment, instant unsubscribe! We don't do self-damage in this household! HARD PASS! \u274c\ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN?** To (3,0)? Yeah it's technically safe, but that's taking us AWAY from the all-you-can-eat buffet!

What's wrong with you?! \ud83e\udd28\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**RIGHT?** To (4,1)? It's open space, but that's the SCENIC route! We'd be abandoning our column 3 dominance to chase... what? The (4,4) apple? That's inefficient and you know it! We don't waste motion here - every move counts! \ud83c\udfaf\u274c\n\n**UP?** OH BABY! \u261d\ufe0f To (3,2)! THIS IS THE PLAY!

They can't touch us! Once we hit length 6-7, we swing west and cut off ALL their escape routes! Remember chat: we have the higher score, so if we force a head-on collision, THEY'RE the ones who get deleted! That's how we win! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Execute UP to (3,2) to continue column 3 dominance.

He's longer (length 3 vs our length 2). Gotta close that gap and get aggressive!\n\nFirst, safety check from our head at (5,5). Our body is at [(6,5), (6,4)]? Wait, check: we grew after eating the apple, so our body should be length 2 plus head. Our head is (5,5), body segments: first after head is (6,5) (our previous head), then (6,4) (our previous tail). So body: [(6,5), (6,4)].\n\n**Immediate safety for each move:**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,6). Inside board? Yes. Into my body? No. Into enemy body? Enemy body at [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0)] \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,4). Inside board? Yes. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,5). Inside board? Yes. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,5). That's our own body segment! \u274c **DEATH MOVE.** Eliminated.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Enemy head at (3,2) now!** He moved UP last turn. His body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0)].\nHis possible moves from (3,2):\n- UP to (3,3) \u2014 apple there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN to (3,1) \u2014 his own body segment \u274c\n- LEFT to (2,2) \u2014 safe\n- RIGHT to (4,2) \u2014 safe\n\nSo his safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. He'll likely go for that (3,3) apple! If he gets it, he'll be at 3 apples, length 4 vs our length 3. We need to intercept or grab our own apple FAST.\n\n**Apples nearby:** (4,5) is one LEFT from us! (4,4) is one LEFT and one DOWN. (3,5) is two LEFT. (6,8) is far. (8,5) is three RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**\nIf we go LEFT to (4,5), he's at (3,2) \u2014 no collision. UP to (5,6) or DOWN to (5,4) \u2014 no. So safe.\n\n**But think about NEXT turn aggression!**\nWe want that (4,5) apple to tie the score! Going LEFT grabs it immediately! That would make us length 3, apples 2. Then we're tied in length with him if he doesn't eat his apple. But if he eats (3,3), he'll be length 4. Still, we need to catch up.\n\nIf we go LEFT and eat (4,5), our new head will be at (4,5), body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\nThen we can pressure him from the side.\n\nWhat about UP or DOWN? They don't get an apple this turn. That lets him potentially get ahead.\n\n**Future mobility after eating apple:**\nFrom (4,5) after eating: possible moves next turn? UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5) \u2014 another apple!, RIGHT (5,5) \u2014 but that's into our new body? Wait, after eating, our body will be: head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So (5,5) will be our neck \u2014 can't go RIGHT into ourselves next turn. So from (4,5), safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Still good options, and LEFT goes to another apple (3,5)!\n\n**Enemy's plan:** He might go UP to (3,3) apple, then maybe LEFT to (2,3) or RIGHT to (4,3). We'll be at (4,5) \u2014 we can threaten to cut him off from the (3,5) and (4,4) apples.\n\n**Danger if we go LEFT?** Only if he goes RIGHT to (4,2) and then next turn UP to (4,3) \u2014 but we'll be at (4,5), not an immediate collision.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** LEFT to grab that apple, tie the score, and position aggressively between him and the left-side apple cluster! Let's box him in! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Enemy's at 3 apples, length 4. We're closing the gap! Time to get AGGRESSIVE and box him in!\n\n**Safety check from our head at (4,5):**\nOur body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,6). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? Enemy body at [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,4). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,5). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,5). That's our own neck! \u274c **DEATH MOVE.** Eliminated.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Enemy head at (3,3)** \u2014 he likely ate the apple at (3,3) last turn! His body now: head (3,3), then [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]? Wait, he grew, so his body length 4: head (3,3), neck (3,2), then (3,1), then (2,1). Yes.\n\n**His possible moves from (3,3):**\n- UP to (3,4) \u2014 safe.\n- DOWN to (3,2) \u2014 his own neck! \u274c\n- LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nSo his safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk THIS turn?**\nIf we go LEFT to (3,5), he goes RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 no collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (4,4), he goes RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 adjacent, not same cell.\nIf we go UP to (4,6), he goes anywhere \u2014 no collision.\nSo all safe from immediate head-on.\n\n**Apples nearby:** (3,5) is LEFT \u2014 ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (4,4) is DOWN \u2014 also an apple! (0,6), (0,8), etc. are far.\n\n**If we grab (3,5):** We tie apples at 3 each, length 4 vs his length 4. Then next turn from (3,5) we can pressure him directly! He's at (3,3) or wherever he moves. We could go DOWN to (3,4) to cut him off, or LEFT to (2,5) toward more apples.\n\n**If we grab (4,4):** Also tie apples, length 4. From (4,4) we're below him; we could go UP to (4,5) but that's our old head? Wait, after eating, body grows: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So (4,5) becomes neck \u2014 can't go UP next turn. From (4,4), safe moves next turn: DOWN (4,3) \u2014 risk head-on if he goes RIGHT to (4,3)? Actually, if he goes RIGHT to (4,3) this turn, next turn he's at (4,3). If we go DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3) next turn, that's a head-on! Risky. LEFT (3,4) \u2014 could block him. RIGHT (5,4) \u2014 safe.\n\n**Long-term plan:** We want to dominate the left side and force him into the wall or our body. He's currently near the left wall (x=3). If we go LEFT to (3,5), we're above him. Next turn we can move DOWN to (3,4) to potentially cut off his UP movement and force him LEFT into wall or into us if he tries to go around. If he goes UP to (3,4) this turn, and we go LEFT to (3,5), we're adjacent vertically. Then next turn if he stays at (3,4) and we go DOWN to (3,4), that's head-on \u2014 but we'd have equal length, so double KO, but he has more apples? Actually we'd both have 3 apples if we eat now, so tie \u2014 but double KO means both die, game ends, tie? Not ideal. We want to win.\n\nBetter: Let's go LEFT and eat (3,5), then assess. If he goes UP to (3,4), we can go LEFT to (2,5) to avoid head-on and keep pressure. If he goes LEFT to (2,3), we can go DOWN to (3,4) to get between him and the center.\n\n**Mobility check after LEFT:**\nFrom (3,5) after eating: body will be head (3,5), neck (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Safe moves next turn: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,4), LEFT (2,5). Three options \u2014 good.\n\n**DOWN to (4,4)** also gives three safe next moves? From (4,4) after eating: safe next: DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). Also three.\n\nBut LEFT gets us closer to him and controls the left side better. We're playing aggressive! Let's push him against the wall!\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to grab that apple, tie the score, and start the boxing maneuver! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

We're the BIG SNAKE on campus now, you feel me?! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's break down this board state because we're playing 4D chess out here! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf\n\n**Current Position Check:**\n- Your boy is at (3,3) with the body stacking down to (2,1)\n- The opp is lurking at (4,5) with a puny 2-segment body\n- Score advantage: 3 to 2! That means if we die together, WE WIN! \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfc6\n\n**Move Analysis - Let's Cook!**\n\n**DOWN?** BRO! That's literally INTO OUR OWN NECK at (3,2)!

They're probably dropping DOWN to (4,4) to eat that apple and tie the score. If we go RIGHT, we're just playing tag in their backyard while the real money is up top!

Then we can either:\n1. Take (3,5) and eat while they scramble, OR\n2. If we both commit to the same cell next turn, it's a DOUBLE KO and we win 3-2! \n\nEither way, WE WIN! That's the power of the longer snake! \ud83e\udde0\u26a1\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Move UP to (3,4) to maintain vertical pressure. Next turn grab that (3,5) apple to pull ahead 4-3. Continue ascending column 3 toward (3,6) and (3,8). Once we hit max length in that corridor, we cut east to box the enemy against the wall.

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e We're now tied at 3 apples each, length 4 vs his length 4. Time to get AGGRESSIVE and box this guy in!\n\n**Safety check from our head at (3,5):**\nOur body: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,6). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? Enemy body at [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] \u2014 no. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? Enemy head is at (3,4)?? Wait, his head is at (3,4) currently! That's his head! If we go DOWN, we move into his head cell \u2014 but he's also moving this turn. That's a potential head-on collision if he stays or moves into (3,4). Risky, but not an immediate death unless he stays. Let's hold that thought.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,5). Inside board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,5). That's our own neck! \u274c **DEATH MOVE.** Eliminated.\n\nSo RIGHT is out. UP, DOWN, LEFT are *potentially* safe, but DOWN has head-on risk.\n\n**Enemy head at (3,4)** \u2014 his body: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)].\nHis possible moves from (3,4):\n- UP to (3,5) \u2014 that's our current head! If he goes UP and we go DOWN, that's head-on at (3,4)? Wait, if he goes UP to (3,5) and we go DOWN to (3,4), we swap places, no collision. Actually, head-on only if both go to same cell.\n- DOWN to (3,3) \u2014 his own neck! \u274c\n- LEFT to (2,4) \u2014 safe.\n- RIGHT to (4,4) \u2014 safe.\n\nSo his safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk THIS turn:**\n- If we go DOWN to (3,4) and he goes UP to (3,5) \u2192 no collision (different cells).\n- If we go DOWN to (3,4) and he goes LEFT to (2,4) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,4) and he goes RIGHT to (4,4) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,4) and he stays? He can't stay; he must move. So no static head-on.\nActually, the only way we collide head-on is if we both choose the same cell. Could that happen?\nWe go DOWN to (3,4). He could go UP to (3,5) \u2014 different.\nHe could go LEFT to (2,4) \u2014 different.\nHe could go RIGHT to (4,4) \u2014 different.\nSo DOWN is safe from immediate head-on! The risk is if he goes UP to (3,5) \u2014 that's our current cell, but we're leaving it, so fine.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if he goes UP to (3,5) and we go UP to (3,6)? Then no issue.\nWhat if he goes LEFT to (2,4) and we go LEFT to (2,5)? No issue.\nWhat if he goes RIGHT to (4,4) and we go DOWN to (3,4)? No issue.\n\nSo all three moves are safe from collision this turn.\n\n**Future positioning:**\nWe want to box him in! He's near the left wall (x=2,3). If we go DOWN to (3,4), we'd be on his head's current cell after he moves \u2014 but that could be good if we can trap him. However, from (3,4) our safe moves next turn would be limited: UP back to (3,5) is neck after growth? Wait, if we go DOWN and there's no apple, we don't grow. So body: head (3,4), neck (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So UP to (3,5) is neck \u2014 not allowed. So from (3,4) safe moves: DOWN (3,3) \u2014 enemy body? Possibly, but risky. LEFT (2,4) \u2014 maybe. RIGHT (4,4) \u2014 safe. That's only 2 safe moves, maybe 1 if DOWN is blocked. Not great.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,5): no apple there. Then body: head (2,5), neck (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Safe next moves from (2,5): UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5). Three options \u2014 good! And we're to his left, potentially cutting off his escape.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,6): no apple. Body: head (3,6), neck (3,5), etc. Safe next moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) \u2014 neck? Wait, neck is (3,5) \u2014 can't go DOWN. LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6). So two safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) actually three? DOWN is neck, so UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. That's three. And we're above him.\n\n**Apples nearby:** (3,6) is UP \u2014 no apple. (2,5) is LEFT \u2014 no apple. (3,4) is DOWN \u2014 apple at (3,4)? Wait, board shows at (3,4) there's '0 A' \u2014 that's enemy head and an apple? Actually, the board shows at (3,4): \"0 A\" meaning enemy head and apple? Yes! There's an apple at (3,4)! So if we go DOWN to (3,4), we EAT the apple, grow to length 5, and tie at 4 apples each. That's huge!\n\nBut going DOWN into his current head cell is risky because he might also want that apple. If he goes UP to (3,5), we eat it uncontested. If he goes LEFT to (2,4) or RIGHT to (4,4), we eat it uncontested. The only conflict is if he stays? He can't stay. So we likely get the apple.\n\nIf we get the apple, we're length 5 vs his length 4. Then next turn from (3,4) with body: head (3,4), neck (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), plus new tail? Actually after eating, we grow, so tail stays at (6,4) for now. Safe moves from (3,4) after eating: DOWN (3,3) \u2014 enemy body? Possibly. LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4). Still limited but we're longer!\n\n**Long-term plan:** Take the apple, get length advantage, then use that to force head-on collisions where we win! With length 5 vs 4, if we go head-on, we both die but we have more apples? Wait, if we both die, game ends, snake with more apples wins. If we have 4 apples and he has 3? Actually he has 3 apples now. If we eat, we have 4, he has 3. So if we force a double KO, we WIN! That's the play!\n\nSo DOWN to grab that apple, get the apple lead, then next turn pressure him into a head-on! He'll have to avoid us, but we can cut off his escapes.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to snatch that apple right from under him, take the lead, and start the endgame! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head escaped to who-knows-where, but now we control the center-right. Next turn, prioritize cutting off their escape routes toward (8,5) or (9,3). Use our length advantage to partition the board. If they try to contest our column, we have the score lead for a favorable trade!
