          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation on the 10x10 board:\n\n- Snake's head is at (7, 1), with the body at (6, 1).\n- The nearest apple to the right at (8, 8) is quite far, but there's also an apple at (9, 7) which is to the upper right, and others at (5, 7), (9, 5), and (6, 2).\n- The current move was right, moving from (7, 1) to (8, 1). But wait\u2014based on the last move, the snake's head is at (7, 1), and previous position was at (6, 1). So, moving right to (8, 1) now would be next.\n- However, the last move's direction was right, so the head just moved to (8, 1). The snake's body is at (6, 1), which means the snake is at (8, 1) with body segments further behind.\n- The apple closest in a strategic sense is at (9, 7), which requires moving up and to the right.\n- There is an apple at (5, 7), which is left and up, potentially avoidable.\n- The enemy snake's head at (5, 0) is disjointed from our path, but its body at (4, 0) is below, so moving down might be risky if the enemy extends upward.\n- The other apples are more distant.\n\nGiven that the current position is (8, 1), and the goal is to collect apples efficiently, the immediate priorities are:\n\n1. Avoid collision with walls or the enemy snake.\n2. Collect the apples that are reachable without risking death.\n\nLooking in that direction:\n\n- Moving right again would take us outside the board at (9, 1) (assuming the snake is at (8, 1) now). But wait, I need to verify the current head position. From the previous info, the snake's head was at (7, 1), moved right to (8, 1). So, moving right now would be to (9, 1).\n\n- But (9, 1) is within bounds. That could be a good move to approach the apple at (9, 7). It's still a vertical distance away, but moving right puts us closer horizontally.\n\n- Moving up from (8, 1) to (8, 2) would position us closer vertically to the apple at (8, 8). From there, moving up multiple steps could be advantageous, but we must check for possible obstacles.\n\nOther options:\n\n- Moving up from (8, 1) to (8, 2):\n\n  - Is (8, 2) safe? Positions are open in that area, no snake bodies blocking directly.\n\n- Moving left or down:\n\n  - Moving left to (7, 1) back would be the reverse, which is not ideal.\n\n  - Moving down to (8, 0) is outside the current position path and could be risky considering the enemy's body at (4, 0), and we are moving away from the closest apples.\n\nSince the immediate goal seems to be approaching the apple at (9, 7), moving right from (7, 1) to (8, 1), then up to (8, 2), and then further upward makes sense.\n\nBut considering the current position at (7, 1):\n\n- Moving **up** to (7, 2):\n\n  - Might be better to get closer to the apple at (6, 2), which is directly to the left, so moving left might be better if trying to get the apple at (6, 2).\n\n- But moving left from (7, 1) to (6, 1):\n\n  - That's safe and gets us closer to the apple at (6, 2). That movement may be safer and more direct.\n\nGiven current info, moving left appears to be a good strategic choice:\n\n- It keeps the snake moving in a safe space.\n\n- It gets us closer to the apple at (6, 2).\n\n- Moving left from (7, 1) to (6, 1), assuming no obstacle, is safe.\n\nNext, from (6, 1), we can go up to (6, 2) to eat the apple at (6, 2).\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- I will choose to move LEFT now, heading from (7, 1) to (6, 1).\n\n- Afterwards, I can plan to go up toward the apple at (6, 2).\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Moving left keeps us on a safe path and positions us to go up next turn to reach that apple.\n\n- The other apples are further away or in less accessible directions right now.\n\n- Moving left also avoids potential collision with the enemy snake's body, which is located at (5, 0). Moving left doesn't bring us into any danger from the enemy.\n\n- Moving up from (7, 1) would place us at (7, 2), which could be good for approaching the apple at (8, 8), but that requires a lot of vertical movement and potentially riskier.\n\n- Moving down would be outside the board or redundant; moving right would take us further from the immediate targets.\n\nIn conclusion, moving **LEFT** from (7, 1) to (6, 1) seems like the most strategic and safe move to get closer to the apple at (6, 2).\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

Moving right isn't possible immediately because (5,1) is occupied.\n\nNext, I need to decide the safest move that progresses toward the apple without risking collision:\n- Moving UP to (4, 2): safe, brings us closer to (6, 2).\n- After that, in the subsequent move, moving RIGHT to (5, 2), then finally to (6, 2).\n\nBut given only one move today, moving UP seems best to continue towards the apple.\n\nNext move: UP\n**Next strategy:** Continue advancing toward the apple at (6, 2), ensuring safety and avoiding collisions.\n\n**Next move: UP**",
