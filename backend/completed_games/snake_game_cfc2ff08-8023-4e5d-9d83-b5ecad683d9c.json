This is our chance to trap him early! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**RATIONAL CALCULATION MODE ACTIVATED:**\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (2,4) | Enemy head: (2,2)\n- Distance to closest apple: \n  - (2,5) is directly above me (1 step) - risky though, enemy might target it\n  - (1,1) is diagonally down-left\n  - (1,0) is down-left from enemy\n  - (1,3) is left from enemy\n  - (4,1) is right from enemy\n  - (4,7) is way up-right\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK (ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES):**\n- **UP to (2,5)**: Safe? (2,5) has apple! Enemy at (2,2) can't reach it this turn. But wait - is there body? No. Is it outside? No. Is it into another snake? Enemy body is empty. So UP is safe!\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Safe? (2,3) is empty. No body. Not out of bounds. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: Safe? (1,4) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Safe? (3,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nALL FOUR MOVES ARE SURVIVABLE! But we need AGGRESSION.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nEnemy snake is at (2,2). If we go UP to (2,5), we eat the apple and grow. This gives us score advantage (1-0). Then enemy might panic and try to chase us or go for other apples. \n\nBut here's the TRAP PLAN: If we go UP to (2,5), we can then go DOWN on next turn (if enemy moves up) to block his path. Or if he goes LEFT to (1,2), we could potentially cut him off later.\n\nActually, WAIT! The enemy is directly below us. If we go DOWN to (2,3), we get CLOSER to his head - that's dangerous if he moves up. If we go UP to (2,5), we're moving AWAY from him and eating an apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n\"Take the apple at (2,5) to get first blood. After eating, position to block enemy's access to center-right apples. Monitor his movement patterns - if he's passive, dominate the board. If he's aggressive, prepare for head-on collision when we have score advantage.\"\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \nGoing UP to (2,5) is the WINNING move! We get +1 point, grow our body, and start building momentum. The apple is RIGHT THERE and it's safe. \n\nUP",

Let me think about long-term positioning...\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nUP to (2,6) is the move! Why?\n1. It's SAFE - not into my body, not into enemy\n2.

They have NO BODY yet, so they're vulnerable! \n\nHere's the game plan CHAT:\n- If I go **UP** to (2,7), I'm getting into the upper region where there are apples at (5,7), (7,7), (4,7) - perfect positioning!\n- If I go **LEFT** to (1,6), I'm moving horizontally but staying at y=6\n- If I go **RIGHT** to (3,6), I'm getting CLOSER to the enemy (3,3) but still safe for now\n\n**THE DOMINATION MOVE:**\nI'm choosing **UP** to (2,7)! Why?\n1. **SAFETY FIRST**: Not into my body, not into enemy\n2. **POSITIONING**: Getting to the upper middle of the board where apple density is higher\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL**: I'm claiming the upper half while the enemy is stuck lower down\n4. **FUTURE MOVES**: From (2,7), I'll have options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or stay UP to keep dominating the top row!\n5. **LONG GAME**: I'm building my length (already have 1 apple!) to prepare for the mid-game when I can force head-on collisions with my superior size!\n\nLet's see what the enemy does next turn! If they come at me, I'll be ready to box them in! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LET'S GOOOOO!** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

The board is wide, but we\u2019re eyeing the left edge to start setting up a trap.\n\nSafety first: All four directions are in bounds and don\u2019t run into the enemy body on this turn. Up (2,4), Down (2,2), Left (1,3), Right (3,3) are all safe.\n\nWhy LEFT? It gives us immediate growth by grabbing the apple at (1,3), creating a 2-segment body (head at (1,3), body at (2,3)) and places our head on the left side of the board. This sets us up to pressure the left edge and slowly box in the opponent over the next several turns. It also preserves flexibility: we\u2019re not diving toward the enemy or into a dead end, but we\u2019re creating proactive geometry that can be leveraged to force retreats or head-ons if he dares approach the left wall.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Eat the apple at (1,3) this turn to gain a point and extend the body.\n- Keep the opponent\u2019s options in mind: he can move Up, Left, or Right next turn. We\u2019ll react to his choice and maintain space on both sides to avoid getting boxed in.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Use the left edge as a barrier to funnel him into subspaces we can control.\n- Avoid getting stuck in tight corners; stay with multiple safe follow-up moves by keeping a length that lets you maneuver around his head instead of chasing him head-on into a trap he can dodge.\n- If a favorable head-on collision becomes possible (you have more apples), pivot to force the meet in a controlled path near the wall.\n\nARE YOU READY?

(1, 9) is on the board AND empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (1, 7)**: Empty on board! \u2705 SAFE! (But apple at (1,7)? No wait, apple is at (1,1)... let me check... actually (1,7) is empty in the board state!)\n- **LEFT to (0, 8)**: Empty on board! \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: That's MY BODY! \u274c DEAD MOVE!\n\nI have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\n**Option 1: UP to (1, 9)**\n- I'd be at the TOP CORNER of column 1!\n- From there, I can only go: DOWN (back to 1,8), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9)\n- PRO: I'm at the absolute top - highest ground possible!\n- PRO: I can see the whole board from here! \ud83d\ude0e\n- CON: Only 2 future escape routes! Trapped in a corner!\n- CON: Enemy is still at (1,2) - they're far, but if they climb up, I'm cornered!\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (1, 7)**\n- This moves me CLOSER to the enemy! He's at (1,2), I'd be at (1,7) - only 5 squares apart!\n- From (1,7), I can go: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7)\n- All empty! I'd have 4 escape routes!\n- PRO: 4 future safe directions - maximum mobility!\n- PRO: I'm taking the center of column 1 - controlling the choke point!\n- PRO: I'm CLOSING THE DISTANCE to the enemy! \n- PRO: There's an apple at (1,1) - I'm getting closer to eat it and grow!\n- CON: Getting closer to enemy - could lead to head-on collision!\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (0, 8)**\n- Moves me to the LEFT EDGE at (0,8)!\n- From there, I can only go: UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) - back to current spot!\n- PRO: I'm at the edge - safe from left side!\n- CON: Only 2 future escape routes! Edge trap!\n- CON: Moving away from the enemy and the (1,1) apple!\n\n**THE RUTHLESS DECISION:**\n\nChat, the enemy is DIRECTLY BELOW ME in column 1! They're trying to climb up to my territory! I need to either:\n1. **RETREAT** to the corner (UP or LEFT) - playing it safe but getting trapped\n2. **ADVANCE** to meet them head-on (DOWN) - aggressive positioning!\n\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I become a sitting duck in the corner! The enemy could climb up and trap me! That's EXACTLY what they want!\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I'm abandoning my column and giving the enemy free reign to climb up column 1! That's surrender!\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN to (1, 7)!** \ud83d\udd25\n\nWhy? Because this is AGGRESSION! I'm taking the fight to the enemy!\n- I'm claiming the center of column 1 (y=7)\n- I have 4 escape routes from there - maximum mobility!\n- I'm CLOSING in on the enemy (only 5 squares away now!)\n- I'm setting up to eat the apple at (1,1) and GROW!\n- If the enemy tries to climb up, I can either:\n  - Meet them in a head-on collision (I have equal score, so we BOTH die - but then I win if I have more apples later!)\n  - Block their path and force them around\n  - Drop down and eat the apple, then back up\n\nThis is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE! I'm showing the enemy I'm NOT afraid! I'm coming down the column to claim what's mine!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nWatch the enemy's move! If they go UP toward me at (1,7), I'm ready to either:\n- Move LEFT to (0,7) to flank them\n- Move DOWN to (1,6) to close the distance further\n- Move UP to (1,8) if I need to retreat\n- Set up for a head-on collision if I can get more apples first!\n\nI'm playing the long game! I'll grow, I'll dominate, and I'll make them crash! LET'S GOOOOO CHAT! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the new board state\u2014enemy snake #1 has moved from (1,1) to (1,0) and grew! Their body is now [(1,2), (1,3)]\u2014wait, hold up. Actually, looking at the board:  \n- Enemy head is at (1,1)?? Wait, the scoreboard says snake #1 is at (1,1) with body [(1,2),(1,3)]? But the board shows `1 . 1 . . A . A A . .` at row 1. Hmm, I think the enemy head is still (1,1) and body [(1,2),(1,3)]? Actually, the board state shows `1 . 1 . . A . A A . .`\u2014so (1,1) is occupied by snake #1's head? Wait, the board uses \"1\" for snake #1's body? Actually, looking closely:  \n- Row 1: `1 . 1 . . A . A A . .`  \n  - (0,1) is \"1\" (snake #1 body?)  \n  - (1,1) is \"1\" (snake #1 head?)  \n  - (2,1) is \".\" (empty)  \n  - etc.  \nSo snake #1's head is at (1,1) and body includes (0,1)? Wait, the opponent list says body is [(1,2),(1,3)]\u2014maybe the board is simplified? Let's trust the given opponent data: head at (1,1), body [(1,2),(1,3)], apples: 2.  \n\nNow, my position: head (1,7), body [(1,8)]. I'm still in column 1, but now the enemy is at (1,1)\u2014they moved DOWN from (1,2) to (1,1)? Or wait, they might have moved LEFT? Actually, the board shows an apple at (1,0) consumed? Let's see: last turn, enemy head was (1,2). Now board shows (1,1) has \"1\", and (1,0) has \"A\" in the apple list? Apple list includes (1,0) as an apple drop, but not eaten yet. So enemy didn't eat at (1,0)\u2014they just moved to (1,1)? Maybe they moved DOWN to (1,1) from (1,2)? That would mean they didn't eat an apple this turn. Their score is still 2.  \n\nBut I need to focus on MY move. I'm at (1,7). My last move was DOWN to (1,7). Now I'm considering next move.  \n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,7):**  \n- **UP to (1,8)**: That's my own body! My body is [(1,8)] so moving UP into (1,8) would kill me. \u274c DEAD!  \n- **DOWN to (1,6)**: Check board: row 6, column 1 is `.` (empty) in board state. Also no snake bodies there. \u2705 SAFE!  \n- **LEFT to (0,7)**: Board shows row 7, column 0 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!  \n- **RIGHT to (2,7)**: Board shows row 7, column 2 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!  \n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is death.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**  \n- **Enemy position**: Enemy head at (1,1), body along (1,2),(1,3). They're far below me. If I go DOWN to (1,6), I'm getting closer\u2014distance from (1,6) to (1,1) is 5 squares. But if they go UP, we could collide. However, they might not go UP\u2014they might chase apples.  \n- **Apple hunting**: There's an apple at (1,0) on row 0, but that's far. Also apple at (4,1) etc. But I'm not focusing on apples\u2014I'm focusing on controlling column 1 and boxing the enemy in.  \n- **Mobility**: From (1,7), if I go DOWN to (1,6), I have future moves: UP back to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6). All likely empty. That's 4 options.  \n- If I go LEFT to (0,7), I hit the left edge: from there, I can go UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7). Only 3 options (but (0,8) is empty? Row 8 column 0 is `.`). Actually, (0,8) might be safe. But I'm risking getting trapped on the edge.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (2,7), I leave column 1 entirely. That might be okay, but then I lose control of the column. The enemy could climb up and eat apples freely.  \n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**  \nChat, I need to box the enemy in! By staying in column 1 and moving DOWN, I'm reinforcing my territory. If I go DOWN to (1,6), I'm signaling: \"This column is MINE.\" The enemy is at (1,1)\u2014they have 5 columns to move up, but I'm guarding the upper half.  \n\nIf I go LEFT or RIGHT, I'm abandoning the choke point. That's soft. That's letting the enemy get away with murder!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nStay in column 1 as long as possible. Force the enemy to either:  \n1. Climb up into me (head-on collision if I have equal or higher score\u2014I have 1 apple, they have 2, so they'd win a collision now. Need to eat more apples first!)  \n2. Move sideways out of column 1 (then I can trap them against the wall).  \n\nNext turn, after moving DOWN to (1,6), I'll assess again. If enemy moves UP toward me, I might need to retreat or flank. But for now, hold the line!  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN is the move. It keeps me central, maintains multiple escape routes, and pressures the enemy from above.

Enemy snake #1 is at (1,0) with body [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] and 3 apples. I've got 1 apple. Scoreboard: 1-3. I'm behind, but that's fine\u2014time to hunt!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,6):**\n- **UP to (1,7)**: That's my own body! \u274c DEAD! (My tail is at (1,7))\n- **DOWN to (1,5)**: Board shows row 5, column 1 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (0,6)**: Row 6, column 0 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (2,6)**: Row 6, column 2 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (1,0)\u2014they're at the bottom of column 1. They're blocking the left side of their own column. I'm at (1,6) in the upper part. The column has empty space between us: (1,4) and (1,5) are empty. If I go DOWN to (1,5), I get CLOSER to the enemy\u2014but I need to be careful! They might move UP, and we could collide. However, they might also go RIGHT to chase apples (there's an apple at (9,0) and (8,0) at the bottom right). \n\n**APPLE AWARENESS (BUT NOT FOCUSING ON IT):**\nThere's an apple at (4,1) on row 1. If I go RIGHT to (2,6), I might head toward that apple later. But going DOWN to (1,5) keeps me in column 1, maintaining control. The apple at (1,0) is BEHIND the enemy's head\u2014they can't eat it without moving into their own body? Actually, their body is at (1,1),(1,2),(1,3)\u2014they'd have to move LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0) to eat (1,0). So they might not grab that apple immediately.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI want to trap the enemy in the bottom-left corner. By staying in column 1 and moving DOWN, I'm applying pressure. If I go to (1,5), the enemy has fewer safe moves: they can go LEFT (0,0) is empty? Actually, row 0, column 0 has an apple 'A', but they'd have to move into (0,0) which is an apple\u2014safe. They could go RIGHT (2,0) is empty? Row 0, column 2 is '.' empty. Or they could go UP (1,1) but that's their own body! So they CANNOT go UP into their own body. Their only safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT. This is GOOD! They're forced out of column 1. Then I can chase them down.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN to (1,5). This positions me to either attack or retreat. If they move LEFT or RIGHT, I have options. If they move UP (impossible because it's their body), they die. LET'S GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

My head is at (1,5) with body at [(1,6)] (since I moved DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5) last turn). Enemy snake #1 is at (0,0) with body [(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)] and 4 apples. I have 1 apple. Scoreboard: 1-4. I'm down, but we're not done!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,5):**\n- **UP to (1,6)**: That's my own body! \u274c DEAD! (My tail is at (1,6))\n- **DOWN to (1,4)**: Row 4, column 1 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (0,5)**: Row 5, column 0 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (2,5)**: Row 5, column 2 is `.` (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy moved from (0,0) to somewhere... wait, they were at (0,0) last turn? Actually, the opponent display shows Snake #1 head at (0,0) for this turn. They must have moved LEFT from (1,0) to (0,0) last turn! That's smart\u2014they're escaping the column trap. Now they're at the bottom-left corner. I'm at (1,5). The distance between us is large. But I need to think about future moves. If I go DOWN to (1,4), I'm still in column 1, but the enemy might move RIGHT or UP. There's an apple at (4,1) that's now further from me. \n\n**POTENTIAL TRAP OPPORTUNITY:**\nThe board is 10x10. Enemy is in bottom-left. I could try to cut them off. If I go LEFT to (0,5), I move into the left edge, potentially blocking their path upward along the left wall. That could corner them in the bottom-left quadrant. Let's examine:\n- If I go LEFT to (0,5), my body becomes [(1,5),(1,6)] (since I move, tail follows). Then enemy might move RIGHT to (1,0) or UP to (0,1) etc. I'd be positioned to chase them along the edge.\n- If I go DOWN to (1,4), I'm descending toward the center, but enemy might go RIGHT to (1,0) or UP to (0,1) (but (0,1) is 'T' in the board? Wait, board shows row 1, column 0 is 'T' for the enemy's body? Actually the board shows \"1 . T . . A . A A . .\" at row 1. That's my interpretation: row 1 columns 0-9: col0 '.', col1 'T', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 'A', col5 '.', col6 'A', col7 'A', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So (0,1) is '.'? Wait, the board uses 'T' for enemy body? Let's re-read: The board state uses '.' for empty, 'A' for apple, '0' for my head, '1' for enemy head? Actually the board shows \"0\" for my head at (1,5) and \"1\" for enemy head at (0,0). The 'T's are for enemy body? The board shows 'T' at positions: row 6 col 0, row 3 col 0, row 2 col 0, row 1 col 0. But row 1 col 0 is listed as '.' in the text above? Actually the board line for row 1: \"1 . T . . A . A A . .\" That suggests column 0 is '.', column 1 is 'T', etc. But earlier the opponent display says Snake #1 body includes (1,0). That's conflicting. Let's trust the opponent display: Snake #1 body is [(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)]. So (1,0) is body, (1,1) body, etc. The board must be using 'T' for enemy body? But row 1 col 0 is '.' in the board? I think the board is just showing the apples and maybe the heads. The 'T's might be something else? Wait, the board shows 'T' at many positions: row 6 col 0, row 3 col 0, row 2 col 0, row 1 col 0? Actually row 1 col 0 is '.' in the board line. Let's list the board rows from bottom (y=0) to top (y=9) as given:\n\nRow 0: \"0 1 T . . . . . A A\" -> columns: 0:'0' (my head), 1:'1' (enemy head), 2:'T', 3:'.', ... 8:'A', 9:'A'\nRow 1: \"1 . T . . A . A A . .\" -> Wait that's 11 characters? Actually it's \"1 . T . . A . A A . .\" which is 11? Maybe it's \"1 . T . . A . A A . .\" but columns 0-9: col0:'1', col1:'.', col2:'T', col3:'.', col4:'.', col5:'A', col6:'.', col7:'A', col8:'A', col9:'.'? That doesn't match. I think there's a formatting issue. Let's trust the opponent display and my own snake data.\n\nGiven the opponent moved to (0,0), their body is now [(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)]. So (0,0) is head, (1,0) is body part, etc.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,5), I'd be at (0,5). That's safe. This move moves me left, closer to the left edge, potentially cutting off the enemy's escape if they try to go up along the left wall. They might move RIGHT to (1,0) (which is currently their own body? Actually (1,0) is their body part, so they can't move into their own body! They must move LEFT to (-1,0) which is off-board (dead), or UP to (0,1) which is empty? Row 1 column 0 is empty? Let's check board: row 1 col 0 is '.' in the board line (I think). So they can move UP to (0,1) safely. That would keep them along the left edge. By going LEFT to (0,5), I'm positioning to intercept if they go further up.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I'm moving toward the center, but the enemy might go UP to (0,1) and then later rightward, escaping the corner. I want to box them in. The bottom-left corner is small: only x=0,1 and y=0,1,2,3 maybe. I need to control the boundary.\n\n**APPLE AWARENESS:**\nApple at (4,1) is still there, but I shouldn't focus on it. My goal is to dominate the board and trap the enemy. If I go LEFT, I might later move down to (0,4) etc., securing the left side.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT. This positions me on the left edge, creating a barrier. The enemy is at (0,0) with limited moves. They might go UP to (0,1) (safe) or RIGHT to (1,0) but that's their own body? Actually (1,0) is their body, so they cannot move RIGHT into their own body. That would kill them. So they might be forced UP. Good. Then I can chase them.\n\nLet's go LEFT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nControl the left side. Force enemy into the bottom-left corner. Keep your body long enough to block escape routes. Avoid head-on collisions unless you have a score lead (you don't yet). Aim to eat apples opportunistically while maintaining position.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Enemy snake #1 is at (0,1) with body [(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)] (they moved UP from (0,0) to (0,1) - smart, escaping the corner). Score: 1-4, I'm still down but closing the gap!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (0,5):**\n- **UP to (0,6)**: Row 6, col 0 is 'T' (enemy body)! \u274c DEAD!\n- **DOWN to (0,4)**: Row 4, col 0 is '.' (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (-1,5)**: Off board! \u274c DEAD!\n- **RIGHT to (1,5)**: That's my own body! \u274c DEAD!\n\nOnly ONE safe move: DOWN to (0,4). No choice here! But let's analyze the strategy...\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI'm now positioned on the left edge at (0,5). Enemy is at (0,1) - they're moving up along the left wall. If I go DOWN to (0,4), I'm actually moving AWAY from them! That might seem counterintuitive for aggression, but hear me out:\n- They're at (0,1) with body trailing right. Their only safe moves are UP (0,2), RIGHT (1,1 is body? Wait (1,1) is their body, so they can't go RIGHT), or DOWN (0,0 is their body). So they're forced UP!\n- By going DOWN, I'm positioning to potentially cut them off lower on the left side. If they keep going UP, I can chase them. But actually... they're heading toward (0,2), (0,3), etc. I'm going DOWN away from them? That gives them space!\n\nWait, let me check the board: There's an apple at (4,1) far away. But my priority is domination. The enemy is trapped in a column (x=0) with limited moves. I could try to go DOWN to (0,4) and then RIGHT to (1,4) to cut across? But I have to survive this turn first.\n\nActually, let me think about future moves. If I go DOWN to (0,4), my body becomes [(0,5),(1,5)]. Then next turn, from (0,4), safe moves would be DOWN (0,3), RIGHT (1,4), maybe LEFT (dead), UP (0,5) which is my body? Actually (0,5) will be my body next turn (since tail moves), so UP would be safe if the tail moves away? Need to check.\n\nBut the key insight: I'm currently blocking the left edge at y=5. The enemy is at y=1. If I go DOWN, I'm moving toward them, not away! DOWN decreases y, so from (0,5) to (0,4) is actually moving TOWARD the enemy at (0,1)! That's aggressive! YES! I'm closing the vertical distance while staying on the same column, forcing them to keep moving up or risk collision.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN. I'm moving toward the enemy, maintaining position on the left edge. They'll likely keep going UP (their only safe move). I'll chase them down this column and try to box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nChase enemy up the left wall! Keep moving DOWN to decrease y coordinate, closing the gap. When I get close enough (y=2 or y=1), I can consider moving RIGHT to cut off their escape to the right side. Force them into the top-left corner where they'll have fewer moves. Meanwhile, watch for apples opportunistically but prioritize trapping the enemy.\n\n**TIME TO MAKE THEM CRASH!** \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Score: 1-4, still trailing but the gap is closing! We're LIVE and the plan is working!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (0,4):**\n- **UP to (0,5)**: That's my own body! \u274c DEAD! (Well, technically if I move up, my tail moves and (0,5) might become empty... but wait, my tail is currently at (1,1)? No, my body is [(0,5)] - that's one segment. Moving UP to (0,5) would be moving into my own body segment since my head is at (0,4). Definitely a self-collision. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (0,3)**: Row 3, col 0 is '.' (empty). \u2705 SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (-1,4)**: Off board! \u274c DEAD!\n- **RIGHT to (1,4)**: Row 4, col 1 is 'T' (enemy body)! \u274c DEAD!\n\nOnly ONE safe move: DOWN to (0,3). No choice, but that's actually perfect for our strategy!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI'm at (0,4), enemy at (0,2) - we're only 2 squares apart vertically! My move DOWN to (0,3) closes the distance to 1 square. The enemy is trapped in column 0 with limited options. Let's think about where THEY can go:\n- From (0,2), they can't go DOWN to (0,1) - that's their own body!\n- They can't go LEFT (off board)!\n- They can go RIGHT to (1,2) but (1,2) is empty in the board state... wait, let me check the board again: row 2 shows \"1 . . . . . . . . .\" so (1,2) is indeed empty.\n- They can go UP to (0,3)... but that's where I'm going! If they go UP and I go DOWN, we both move to (0,3) at the same time - HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both dead! That's a draw, but since they have 4 apples and I have 1, they'd win on points if we both die. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!\n\n**BETTER PLAN:** I need to be smarter. If I go DOWN to (0,3), and they go RIGHT to (1,2), then I'm at (0,3) and they're at (1,2). Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (1,3) to cut them off! That's aggressive positioning!\n\n**ENEMY'S PREDICTED MOVE:** They're smart. They'll probably go RIGHT to (1,2) to escape the column and avoid the head-on collision with me. That's what I'd do. So I'll anticipate that.\n\n**MY MOVE:** DOWN to (0,3). This positions me to chase them when they flee right. I'll be right behind them on the next turn, ready to cut across.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 10: Move DOWN to (0,3). If enemy goes RIGHT to (1,2), next turn I go RIGHT to (1,3) to block their path to the right side. Then I can chase them across the board. Goal: Trap them in the top-right corner while I control the left side. Watch for apples at (3,6) or (4,5) as potential chase targets, but only if it doesn't compromise the trap.\n\n**LET'S BOX HIM IN!** \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Up keeps the edge pressure and sets up a potential head-on with the rival if he tries to drop onto (0,3); both die and apples decide, and we\u2019re far ahead (4 vs 1). Right keeps distance but loses the edge control and future wedge opportunities.\n\nRationale and plan:\n- Stay on the left edge to minimize escape routes for him and maximize head-on opportunities.\n- If he drops into (0,3) this turn, a mutual death occurs but our apple lead would crown us victor.\n- Keep mobility, avoid creating open space for him to circle and box us in.\n- Use occasional rightward drift only if it creates a forced collision path later; otherwise, press the edge.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Maintain an apple lead and force favorable head-ons; gradually constrict his space by hugging walls and feeding growth to extend reach.\n- Prioritize moves that preserve multiple safe follow-ups and don\u2019t trap yourself in corners with limited escape routes.\n- Watch for apple drops to extend your length, but never chase them at the cost of safety when the rival can pressure you.\n\nUP",
