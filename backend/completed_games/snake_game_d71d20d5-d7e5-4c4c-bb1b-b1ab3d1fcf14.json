The enemy snake is three squares below me at (3, 2). Its next moves could place it near me if I move toward the lower part of the board.\n2. If I move toward the edges, I could trap myself later. I need to prioritize staying in open spaces and avoiding tight corridors.\n3. Colliding with the enemy snake is an instant loss.\n\n### **Opportunities**\n1. The apple at (2, 5) is very close by\u2014just to my left. This is the lowest-hanging fruit and should greatly influence my first move.\n2. There are other apples that are farther away. Once I collect the closest apple, I can decide between moving toward (4, 3) or (5, 7) based on open paths and enemy positioning.\n3. Growing by eating an apple will give me an extra body segment and more strategic flexibility.\n\n### **Immediate Strategy**\nFor this turn:\n- The apple at (2, 5) is directly to my left.\n- Moving LEFT is safe, as there\u2019s no wall, no enemy snake, and I can gain a point.\n- After eating the apple, I\u2019ll reassess the layout and aim toward the next closest apple.\n\n### **Future Considerations**\n- After eating the apple at (2, 5), I\u2019ll likely have to decide between moving toward (4, 3) or (5, 7) depending on the enemy snake's positioning in the next turn.\n- Avoid staying too close to Snake #0 unless I can move faster than it to secure an apple safely.\n\n### **Decided Next Move**\n**LEFT.**"
