Grab it, grow +1 point, and start putting pressure on the opponent\u2019s lane.\n\n**Safety check**:  \n- **UP \u2192 (9,\u202f2)** \u2013 free, not off\u2011board, opponent can\u2019t reach it this turn, and no body there. \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,\u202f0)** \u2013 empty but no apple, a bit farther from the action.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,\u202f1)** \u2013 empty, also no apple, and moves us sideways away from the opponent\u2019s column.\n\n**Strategic vibe**: Snag the apple now, get a length boost, and keep the opponent guessing. With a longer body, I can start hemming them in as we both drift down the right wall. Plus, staying in the same column keeps my future routes open for a potential head\u2011on clash later when I\u2019m ahead on the score board. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Risk of head\u2011on**: The rival\u2019s possible moves are LEFT, DOWN, or UP (RIGHT is off\u2011grid). None of those land on (9,\u202f2) this turn, so a simultaneous head\u2011collision is impossible right now.\n\n**Bottom line** \u2013 the best mix of immediate apple, safety, and future aggression is to move **UP**.\n\nUP",

Let's get this bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE SCENARIO:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 6) - I'm on the right edge, top quadrant.\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 1) - He's on the right edge, bottom quadrant.\n- **Apples:** Loads of them. The board is filled with 'A's. We got apples at (0,7), (7,5), (7,4), (6,1), (0,6), (7,3), (0,8), (8,0), (9,2), (0,9), (4,6), (3,3), (3,0), (1,9), (3,1).\n- **Score:** 0-0. First blood wins momentum.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe need to box him in. He's at (9,1). If I move **DOWN** to (9,5), I'm closing the distance on the right edge. I'm putting myself vertically between him and the top-right apples.\nLet's look at the board state visually again (from the prompt):\n```\n 9 A A . . . . . . . .\n 8 A . . . . . . . . .\n 7 A . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . A . . . . 0   <-- Me at (9,6)\n 5 . . . . . . . A . .\n 4 . . . . . . . A . .\n 3 . . . A . . . A . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . A\n 1 . . . A . . A . . 1   <-- Enemy at (9,1)\n 0 . . . A . . . . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (to 9,7):** This is safe (empty). But it takes me further away from the enemy and the cluster of apples in the lower right (like (9,2)). It also leads me toward the top-left A's, which is a long walk. Not ideal for early aggression.\n2.  **LEFT (to 8,6):** This is safe (empty). It moves me off the edge into the open. This is a viable option to go for the apple at (7,5) or (7,4). However, it leaves the right column open. If I leave the edge, the enemy might take it or flank me.\n3.  **DOWN (to 9,5):** **THIS IS THE PLAY.** It is safe (empty). It moves me down the right column.\n    *   **Aggression:** I am moving directly towards the enemy's vertical plane. He is at (9,1). I am at (9,6). I am cutting off his access to the top-right apples.\n    *   **Apple Access:** I am now closer to (9,2) (an apple is there!) and (8,0). I can pivot left to hit the apples at (7,5) or (7,4) next turn.\n    *   **Boxing In:** By taking the right edge, I restrict his movement. If he moves up, he risks running into me. If he moves left, he loses the edge.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **DOWN** to (9,5). Establish dominance on the right side. Watch his move. If he moves Up, we might have a collision scenario (if I continue Down). Since we are 0-0, a head-on collision is a draw, which is boring. I want a kill. If he moves Left or Up, I will assess next turn. But for now, claiming the column is key.\n\nChat, we're moving DOWN! Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

We're LIVE in Turn 1 and the stakes are HIGH! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down the board.\n\n**THE SCENARIO:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 5) \u2014 I'm on the right edge, mid-right quadrant. I just moved DOWN from (9, 6).\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 2) \u2014 He's on the right edge, low-right quadrant. Body at (9, 1).\n- **Apples:** Plenty on the board. (9, 2) is an apple right where the enemy head is! (8, 0) is bottom-right corner. (7, 5), (7, 4) are mid-right. (6, 1) is low-right.\n- **Score:** I'm 0, Enemy is 1. He ate an apple recently (probably (9, 2) last turn? No, his head is (9, 2) now, so he might be sitting on it or just ate. Wait, the prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (9, 2), Body: [(9, 1)], Apples: 1\". If he ate (9, 2), he'd have grown. His body is only (9, 1). So he is sitting on (9, 2) *now*, but hasn't necessarily eaten it this turn yet? No, the turn happens simultaneously. If he moves *off* it, he doesn't eat it. If he stays, he eats. If he moves into it... he's already there? No, the apple list says (9, 2) is an apple. The enemy is at (9, 2). Does that mean he's eating it this turn?\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The prompt lists \"Apple drops: ... (9, 2)\". And Enemy Head is (9, 2). This implies the enemy is currently occupying an apple. In Snake mechanics, usually you eat when you move *onto* a square. If he is already there, he likely ate it on a previous turn. But the apple list is just \"drops\". If he is on it, and it's an apple, he should eat it now. However, he has 1 apple already. If he eats (9, 2), he goes to 2.\n    *   *Wait:* The board state shows `2 . . . . . . . . . 1`. This is row 2. Enemy head is at x=9, y=2. The apple at (9, 2) is on the board. So yes, the enemy is on an apple. He will likely eat it this turn (if he stays) or move off.\n    *   *Crucial:* The enemy has 1 apple. I have 0. If I can kill him, I win dominance.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MOVES (Current pos: 9,5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Check (9, 6). My previous head was (9, 6), tail is (9, 1). So (9, 6) is empty (tail moves out usually, or body is gone since I have no body segments? \"Body: none\"). Yes, I have no body. (9, 6) is safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves me back up. Enemy is at (9, 2). I'm moving away. Not aggressive. I want to box him in on the right edge. Moving up gives him the bottom.\n\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* (8, 5) is empty (visual check: Row 5 is ` . . . . . . . A . 0`. Wait, row 5 corresponds to y=5. The prompt shows: `5 . . . . . . . A . 0`. So x=8 (which is the 9th column, 0-indexed) is the 'A'? No. Let's count.\n    *   Row 5 (y=5): ` . . . . . . . A . 0`\n        *   x=0: .\n        *   x=1: .\n        *   x=2: .\n        *   x=3: .\n        *   x=4: .\n        *   x=5: .\n        *   x=6: .\n        *   x=7: A\n        *   x=8: .\n        *   x=9: 0 (Me)\n    *   So (8, 5) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves me off the edge. Opens up the board. Good for apple chasing (aiming for (7, 5) or (7, 4)). However, I lose control of the right edge column. The enemy is at (9, 2). If I leave the column, he can move up safely.\n\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* (9, 4). Row 4: ` . . . . . . . A . .`. x=9 is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* This is the aggressive play. I am chasing the enemy down the column. He is at (9, 2). I am at (9, 5). If I go DOWN, I get to (9, 4). Distance is 2 squares.\n    *   *Risk:* He might move UP to (9, 3) or (9, 4). If he moves UP to (9, 4), we collide (Head-on). Score is 0 vs 1. If we die simultaneously, he wins (higher score). **I cannot risk a head-on collision while losing in score.** I must avoid him or force a collision where I win (e.g., I have more apples, or I kill him with my body).\n    *   *Wait:* If I move DOWN to (9, 4) and he moves UP to (9, 3), we are adjacent. If he moves UP to (9, 4), we crash. I need to check if I can cut him off without dying.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Off the board. Dead. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nI need to stop the enemy from gaining more apples. He is sitting on (9, 2). He will likely eat it or move to (8, 2) or (9, 3).\nIf I move **DOWN to (9, 4)**:\n- I am closer to him.\n- He is at (9, 2).\n- If he moves UP to (9, 3): I am at (9, 4). Next turn I could potentially block him or force a fight.\n- If he moves LEFT to (8, 2): He leaves the apple at (9, 2). I can then move DOWN to (9, 3) or (9, 2) to eat the apple myself? No, he is leaving it. If he leaves it, it stays.\n- If he moves UP to (9, 3) and I move DOWN to (9, 4): We are 1 square apart. He is trapped against the wall? No, he has Left (8, 3) and Up (9, 4 - occupied by me). He can't go Down (9, 2 - occupied by his body? No, his body is (9, 1)). So he can go Left or Up (into me).\n- **Crucial Info:** If I move DOWN and he moves UP into me (9, 4), I die because he has higher score (1 vs 0). I must avoid this.\n- However, if I move DOWN and he moves UP to (9, 3), I am safe. Next turn, I can move DOWN to (9, 3) to block him or Left to (8, 4) to flank.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: LEFT to (8, 5).**\n- This moves me away from the direct confrontation.\n- It allows me to sweep the right side for apples ((7,5), (7,4), (6,1)).\n- It leaves the enemy at (9, 2). He can move UP the column freely.\n- If I leave the column, he owns it. That's bad for boxing him in.\n\n**The \"Box Him In\" Plan:**\nI need to control the column. But I cannot risk a head-on death while losing.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I am threatening him. If he moves UP, it's a standoff. If he moves LEFT, I gain ground.\nIs there a better move?\nWhat if I move **LEFT**?\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5), I open up (7, 5) and (7, 4).\nIf he moves UP to (9, 3), he is safe.\nIf he moves LEFT to (8, 2), he is safe.\nIf I move LEFT, I lose the vertical advantage.\n\n**Wait, look at the board state again.**\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . . . . 1`\nRow 1: `1 . . . A . . A . . T` (Tail at (9, 1))\nRow 0: `0 . . . A . . . . A .`\n\nThe enemy is at (9, 2). His tail is (9, 1).\nIf I move **DOWN to (9, 4)**:\n- I am at (9, 4).\n- Enemy at (9, 2).\n- If he moves UP to (9, 3): We are adjacent. He is safe this turn.\n- If he moves UP to (9, 3) and I move DOWN to (9, 3) next turn, we collide. He wins (1 > 0).\n- **I cannot win a direct 1v1 fight yet.** I need an apple.\n- The closest apple to me is (7, 5) or (7, 4) (if I go Left) or (8, 0) (if I go Left/Down).\n- The apple at (9, 2) is contested. He is sitting on it. If I move DOWN to (9, 4), and he eats (9, 2) (by staying or moving back?), he grows.\n- Actually, if he moves UP to (9, 3), he leaves (9, 2) empty. Then on the next turn, I could move to (9, 2) if I survive. But he would be at (9, 3). I can't move into him.\n\n**Re-evaluating Aggression vs Survival:**\nMy score is 0. His is 1.\nRule: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI do NOT have a higher score. I must avoid a head-on collision.\nThis means I should NOT move directly towards him if he is likely to move towards me.\nHowever, I can move towards him if I can guarantee a kill via trapping or if he moves away.\n\nWhat if I move **LEFT to (8, 5)**?\n- This is safe.\n- It moves me towards the cluster of apples in the center/right.\n- It avoids the immediate confrontation in the column.\n- It allows me to maneuver.\n- If I leave the column, he might move up. But if he moves up, he's chasing apples at (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9). That's the top-left. He's bottom-right.\n- If he goes for the top-left, he exposes his back?\n- If I stay on the right edge (Move DOWN), I am in a corridor. If he moves UP, I block him. If he moves LEFT, I can chase him.\n\n**Let's look at the \"Box In\" concept again.**\nIf I move **DOWN to (9, 4)**:\n- I am at y=4. He is at y=2.\n- The gap is 1 cell (y=3).\n- If he moves UP to (9, 3), the gap is 0.\n- If the gap is 0, I cannot move into him (I lose on score).\n- So if he moves UP, I must move LEFT or UP.\n- If I move DOWN and he moves LEFT, I am at (9, 4) and he is at (8, 2). I haven't trapped him, but I've kept pressure on the edge.\n\n**Is there a move that secures an apple SAFELY?**\nApple at (7, 5).\nPath: LEFT to (8, 5). Next turn LEFT to (7, 5).\nThis gets me +1 score.\nIf I have +1 score, then a head-on collision with the enemy (who has 1) is a TIE (draw). A draw is better than a loss.\nIf I die, I lose. If I draw, it's neutral.\nSo, getting an apple is priority to equalize the score and remove the disadvantage of head-on collisions.\n\n**Comparison:**\nOption A: Move **DOWN (9, 4)**.\n- Pros: Pressure on enemy, controls the right edge.\n- Cons: Enemy has score advantage (1 vs 0). If he moves UP and we collide, I lose. If he moves UP and traps me, I'm stuck.\n- Outcome: High risk of immediate loss if he counters aggressively.\n\nOption B: Move **LEFT (8, 5)**.\n- Pros: Moves towards apple (7, 5). Opens up board. Avoids direct collision while score is losing. Safe follow-up moves (LEFT to 7, 5 or DOWN to 8, 4).\n- Cons: Loses control of the right edge column.\n- Outcome: Gaining an apple equalizes score, allowing me to fight later.\n\n**The Play:**\nI am behind in score. I cannot afford to trade lives evenly. I need to grow first.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is accessible and safe.\nThe apple at (9, 2) is occupied by the enemy. It's dangerous.\nThe apple at (8, 0) is far down.\n\nI will move **LEFT** to secure the apple at (7, 5) in the following turns. This is the smartest path to equalizing the score and unlocking my full aggressive potential.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 5). Next turn, move LEFT to (7, 5) to eat the apple (score 1-1). Then assess the enemy position. If he is still on the right edge, I can loop back to trap him. If he moved towards the center, I flank him.\n\nLET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is at **(8, 2)**, but check this\u2014their tail is at **(9, 2)** now? Wait, looking at the board state: Row 2 ends with `1 T`. That means the enemy head is at **(8, 2)** and the tail is at **(9, 2)**. So the enemy just moved LEFT from (9, 2) to (8, 2). They left the apple at (9, 2) behind! That apple is now free for the taking.\n\n**THE OPPORTUNITY:**\nMy score is 0. Enemy score is 1. I need to equalize. The closest apple to me is **(7, 5)** (left of me). But there's also an apple at **(9, 2)** right behind the enemy. However, if I try to chase the apple at (9, 2) by moving RIGHT, I'd be moving into a space the enemy just left. But the enemy is at (8, 2). If I move RIGHT to (9, 5), I'm not closer to (9, 2). If I move DOWN to (8, 4), I'm closer to the center.\n\n**ANALYZING THE MOVES (Current pos: 8,5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Check (8, 6). Board shows Row 6: `6 A . . . A . . . .`. (8, 6) is the 9th column (x=8), y=6. It's empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves me up. Not towards apples immediately. Enemy is below. I'd be moving away from the action.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Check (8, 4). Board shows Row 4: `4 . . . . . . . A . .`. (8, 4) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves me down towards the enemy. Enemy is at (8, 2). If I go to (8, 4), distance is 2. If he moves UP to (8, 3), distance is 1. I'm closing the gap.\n    *   *Risk:* He might move UP. If he moves UP and I move DOWN, we are adjacent. He has higher score (1 vs 0). I must avoid a head-on collision where I lose.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Check (7, 5). Board shows Row 5: `5 . . . . . . . A . 0`. Wait, (7, 5) is 'A'? Let's recount.\n        *   x=0: .\n        *   x=1: .\n        *   x=2: .\n        *   x=3: .\n        *   x=4: .\n        *   x=5: .\n        *   x=6: .\n        *   x=7: A\n        *   x=8: .\n        *   x=9: 0 (Me)\n    *   **CRITICAL:** (7, 5) contains an **APPLE ('A')**.\n    *   *Safety:* Is it blocked by a snake? Enemy is at (8, 2). No. My body is empty. So it is safe to move onto the apple.\n    *   *Strategy:* This is the winning move. I eat the apple. My score becomes 1. This matches the enemy's score. Now, if we have a head-on collision, it's a tie (or I win if I can trap him). I gain a body segment.\n    *   *Follow-up:* After eating, I will have a body at (8, 5) and head at (7, 5). Next turn, I can maneuver (e.g., DOWN to 7,4, LEFT to 6,5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* (9, 5) is empty (Row 5 ends with 0 at x=9, but wait, I'm at x=8. Moving Right puts me at x=9). Row 5: `5 . . . . . . . A . 0`. The '0' is my current position. The spot to the right is empty.\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves me to the wall. Not ideal. The apple at (9, 2) is 3 steps away. The apple at (7, 5) is 1 step away. Left is better.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI am score 0. Enemy is score 1. **Rule: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"** Since I am lower, I must avoid a direct trade. I need to grow.\n\nThe apple at **(7, 5)** is directly to my LEFT. It is safe. Eating it puts me at 1 apple, leveling the playing field. This is the safest, most effective play. It denies the apple to the enemy (who is far away) and secures my position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 5). Secure the left flank. Observe enemy movement. If he moves up the left side, I cut him off from the bottom-right apples. If he goes for the center, I dominate the left edge. We equalize the score and prepare for the hunt.\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf5e\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 3 and the tension is CRACKLING!**\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy (Snake #1) is at **(7, 2)**. I am at **(7, 5)** (after eating the apple last turn\u2014GLORIOUS!). My body is at **(8, 5)**. The enemy is DIRECTLY BELOW ME, just 3 tiles away in the Y-axis (vertical alignment!). They are at the same X coordinate (7). This is dangerously close.\n\n**SNAKE STAT CHECK:**\n- **My Score:** 1 (Body length: Head (7,5) + Body (8,5))\n- **Enemy Score:** 1 (Body length: Head (7,2) + Body (8,2))\n\n**The Score is TIED.** The rule is clear: **\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"** Since we are TIED, a head-on collision means **DOUBLE DEATH**. We both die. That ends the game with a tie (since we have equal apples). I don't want a tie. I want the WIN. I must avoid head-on collisions at all costs right now.\n\n**ANALYZING THE DISTANCE:**\nIf I stay at (7, 5) and the enemy moves UP (to 7,3), the distance closes to 2 tiles. If they move UP again (to 7,4), distance is 1 tile. They are on a collision course.\nI need to break the vertical alignment. I need to move LEFT or RIGHT to force a \"chase\" scenario where I can maneuver better, or force them to make a mistake.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (Current: 7,5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Row 6 at x=7 is 'A' (Apple). Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* Moving UP aligns me further with the wall (top is y=9). Enemy is at y=2 moving up. I am pushing myself into a corner. If they chase, I have fewer escape routes. Not ideal for \"keeping options open.\"\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Row 4 at x=7 is 'A' (Apple). Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* **CRITICAL DANGER.** This moves me CLOSER to the enemy. If they move UP to (7, 3), we are at (7,4) vs (7,3). Still aligned. If they move UP to (7, 4) on the same turn, **HEAD-ON COLLISION.** Since I can't guarantee they won't move UP (it's a straight path for them), moving DOWN is gambling with a double death. Since I want to WIN, not tie, I must avoid this.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (to 8, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* (8, 5) is my **CURRENT BODY** (the tail from my last move).\n    *   *Risk:* **DEATH.** Hitting my own body. Game over. Do not do this.\n\n4.  **LEFT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Row 5 at x=6 is '.' (Empty). No snake bodies there. Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* **PERFECT.**\n        *   It breaks the vertical alignment with the enemy (I go to x=6, they stay at x=7).\n        *   It moves me closer to the center-left of the board (resources/apples).\n        *   It forces the enemy to either chase me (turning left) or ignore me. If they chase, I have the body length to maneuver.\n        *   It keeps my path open to move UP or DOWN next turn, giving me options.\n        *   It moves me AWAY from the immediate threat below.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1.  **Current Move:** Go **LEFT** to (6, 5). Break the vertical lock.\n2.  **Observation:** Watch the enemy. If they turn towards me (to x=6 or x=7/y=3+), I maintain distance. If they go for apples elsewhere, I eat the ones around the center/left (like (3,3) or (4,6)).\n3.  **Goal:** Get to 2 apples first. Once I lead by 1 apple, I can start forcing head-on collisions safely. Until then, I must survive and break alignment.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE DODGING A BULLET HERE!** Let's stay agile!\n\nLEFT",

Body length: Head (7,3) + Body (7,2) + Tail (8,2))\n\n**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK:**\nThe enemy **LEAD by 1 Apple (2 vs 1)**.\nAccording to the rules: **\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"**\n**THE ENEMY HAS THE HIGHER SCORE.** If they force a head-on collision now, **I DIE** and they win (or at least they survive if it's a double death, but they have the lead).\n**I CANNOT FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION. I MUST SURVIVE.**\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at **(7, 3)**. I am at **(6, 5)**.\nThey are **NOT** directly aligned vertically anymore (I moved Left). They are at X=7, I am at X=6.\nHowever, they are *diagonally* adjacent (distance: 2 tiles). If they move **LEFT** to (6, 3) and I move **DOWN** to (6, 4), we are getting very close.\n**If they move UP (to 7,4) and I move DOWN (6,4), no collision.**\n**If they move LEFT (to 6,3) and I move DOWN (6,4), we are adjacent vertically but not colliding.**\n\n**WHERE IS THE ENEMY GOING?**\nThe enemy is hunting apples. They are at (7, 3).\nVisible Apples: (0,7), (7,4), (6,1), (0,6), (0,8)...\nThe closest apple to them is **(7, 4)** (Directly Above them).\n**Prediction:** The enemy will move **UP** to (7, 4) to eat that apple and grow to length 3. This is the safest, most logical play for them to extend their lead.\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS (Current: 6,5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 6):**\n    *   *Safety:* Empty ('.' on row 6, col 6 in board state). Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* The enemy is predicting **UP** to (7,4). If I go **UP**, I am moving away from the potential conflict zone (center-bottom). I am moving toward the top-left cluster of apples (0,6, 0,7, 0,8, 0,9). But is that safe?\n    *   *Enemy Collision Check:* If Enemy goes **UP** (7,4) and I go **UP** (6,6), no collision.\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but isolated.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Row 4 at x=6 is '.' (Empty). Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* This brings me closer to the enemy's predicted position (7,4).\n    *   *Strategy:* If the enemy goes **UP** to (7,4), I go **DOWN** to (6,4). I will be standing right next to them (diagonally adjacent). If they have length 3, their body is (7,3) and (7,2). I am safe.\n    *   *Long Term:* This keeps me in the center of the board. **(7, 4)** is an apple. If the enemy goes UP and eats it, that spot becomes safe (empty) for me next turn (since the apple is gone and their tail moves). **(6, 4)** is a great position to pivot from.\n    *   *Verdict:* **STRONG.** Keeps me in the game flow.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Row 5 at x=5 is '.' (Empty). Safe.\n    *   *Strategy:* This moves me toward the far left wall. I see an apple at **(3, 3)**, but I am at Y=5. To eat it, I'd need to go Down (to 5,3) then Left.\n    *   *Risk:* Moving Left puts me further from the enemy. The enemy is at (7,3). If I go Left, I am abandoning the center.\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but passive. I need to stay aggressive (in position) to eventually challenge.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* (7, 5) is my **PREVIOUS BODY**. My body is currently at [(7, 5)].\n    *   *Risk:* **DEATH.** I would hit my own tail.\n    *   *Verdict:* **HARD NO.**\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THIS TURN:**\nI am trailing 1-2. I need to catch up.\nThe enemy is likely going **UP** to (7,4).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (6,4), I am positioning myself to contest the center. I am not colliding. I am staying alive.\nMore importantly, look at the apple list: **(3, 0)** is an apple. I am at (6,5). If I go **DOWN** to (6,4), I can continue **DOWN** toward (6,1) or pivot Left toward (3,3) or (3,0).\n**DOWN** keeps my options open (Up, Left, Right) whereas **LEFT** or **UP** limits my immediate mobility (UP = wall soon, LEFT = wall soon).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (6, 4). This positions me perfectly to react to the enemy's move. If they go UP, I am adjacent. If they turn Left, I am safe. It also puts me on the path to the lower apples.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE SETTING UP THE TRAP!** Let's see if the hungry snake takes the bait up top!\n\nDOWN",

So they\u2019re forced into less advantageous positions.\n3. **Keep options open** \u2013 From (6,4) I\u2019ll still have UP, LEFT, and DOWN next turn, so I\u2019m not boxing myself in.\n4. **No apple gamble needed now** \u2013 I already lead 3\u20111. Staying alive and tightening the net beats chasing a distant apple that could set me up for a trap later.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n- Turn\u202f5: **LEFT** to (6,4).  \n- Next turn: mirror the opponent\u2019s direction if they go left, otherwise keep pushing left or drop down to keep the corridor tight.  \n- As the corridor narrows, look for an apple on the left edge (e.g., (0,7) or (0,8)) to grow while still hemming them in.\n\nLet\u2019s cut him off!  \n\n**LEFT**",

Let's analyze the battlefield.\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\nSnake #1 is at (7,4) with length 4 (apples: 3). They have grown. They are currently at my **RIGHT** side. Their body trail is (7,3), (7,2), (8,2).\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nIf I move **RIGHT** (into the enemy's head at 7,4), I die.\nIf I move **UP** (into 6,5), is it safe?\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 5: ` . . . . . . T . . . `\nColumn 6 at Row 5 is `T`? Wait, the board state says `(6,5)` is `T`?\nLet's re-read the board state.\n`5 . . . . . . T . . .`\n`4 . . . . . . 0 1 . .`\n`6 . . . . A . . . . A`\n`(6,5)` is row 5, col 6.\nThe board shows `T` at (6,5)? But my body is at (6,5). Usually, my body isn't marked as `T` (which is tail), and it wasn't marked as `0` in the previous turn's board.\nWait, last turn I moved from (6,5) to (6,4).\nSo (6,5) should now be empty, OR it's part of my body but not the head.\nActually, the board state provided:\n`5 . . . . . . T . . .`\n`4 . . . . . . 0 1 . .`\n\nLet's look at the coordinates carefully.\n(6,4) is `0` (My head).\n(6,5) is row 5, col 6. The board says `T` there.\n(7,4) is `1` (Enemy head).\n\nWait, let's look at the Snake #1 body from the text:\nSnake #1 - Head: (7,4), Body: [(7,3), (7,2), (8,2)]\nSo (8,2) is their tail.\nIs (6,5) occupied by Snake #1? No.\nIs (6,5) occupied by ME?\nMy body: Head (6,4), Body [(6,5)].\nSo yes, (6,5) is my body.\nThe board state might be slightly simplified or using `T` for my tail? No, usually `T` is enemy tails.\nLet's look at the Board Key.\n`0` = My Head.\n`1` = Enemy Head.\n`T` = Enemy Tail? (Usually, but let's look at the board again).\nRow 3: `3 . . . A . . . T . .`\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . . T T .`\nSnake #1 Body: (7,3), (7,2), (8,2).\n(7,3) is row 3, col 7 -> that's `T`? No, the board has `T` at (8,3)? No, row 3 is `... T ...` at col 8? No, col 8 is `(8,3)`. The board says `(8,2)` is tail.\nRow 2: ` . . . . . . . T T .`\nCol 7 is `T`. Col 8 is `T`.\nSnake #1 body is (7,3), (7,2), (8,2).\n(7,2) is `T`. (8,2) is `T`.\nSo `T` marks the enemy body? Or just the tail?\nWait, (7,3) is also body. Row 3: ` . . . A . . . T . .`\nCol 7 at row 3 is `T`. Yes, (7,3) is `T`.\nSo `T` marks the enemy body.\n\nWhere is my body marked?\nMy body is (6,5).\nRow 5: `5 . . . . . . T . . .`\nCol 6 is `T`. This implies (6,5) is marked as `T`.\nWhy is my body marked as `T`?\nMaybe the board is just showing \"Snake Body\" generally as `T`? Or it's a quirk of this specific board render.\nRegardless, I know (6,5) is my own body.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP to (6,5)**: This is my own body. **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN to (6,3)**: Empty? Row 3, col 6 is `.` (Yes, row 3 is ` . . . A . . . T . .`). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (5,4)**: Empty? Row 4, col 5 is `.` (Row 4 is ` . . . . . . 0 1 . .`). Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,4)**: Enemy Head. **DEAD.**\n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**\n-   **UP**: Hits my own body (the tail is right there at 6,5).\n-   **RIGHT**: Hits enemy head (7,4).\n\n**SURVIVAL CHOICES:** DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are losing 1-3. We need apples.\nApple at (3,3) is close.\nApple at (3,0) is close.\nApple at (6,1) is close.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (5,4)**:\nI move closer to (3,3) and (3,0).\nThe enemy is at (7,4). They are likely to move Left towards me or Up/Down.\nIf I go Left, I am moving away from the enemy (towards the left wall).\nIs (5,4) safe from future traps? The left side is mostly open. I can bounce back right.\n\nIf I go **DOWN (6,3)**:\nI move closer to (6,1) and (3,0).\nThe enemy is at (7,4).\nIf I go Down to (6,3), I am directly below the column next to the enemy (7,4).\nThe enemy might chase apples on the left side (0,7 etc) or stay central.\nIf I go Down, I might be walking into a vertical alignment with the enemy if they decide to come down.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF ENEMY INTENT:**\nEnemy is at (7,4). They just ate and grew. They have length 4.\nThey might want to secure more apples.\nClosest apples to them: (7,4) was just eaten. Next is (8,0)? (9,6)? (5,7)?\nActually, looking at the board:\n(8,0) is `A`. (Distance: 4 tiles down).\n(5,7) is `A`. (Distance: 3 tiles left/up).\n(4,6) is `A`.\n\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6,4), they hit me (I'm at 6,4). They die.\nIf the enemy moves **UP** to (7,5), that's empty.\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (7,3), that's their own body? (7,3) is (7,3) is in their body list [(7,3), (7,2)...]. Yes, (7,3) is their body. They would die.\nIf the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (8,4), that's empty.\n\nWait, let's check the board state again.\nRow 4: ` . . . . . . 0 1 . .`\nEnemy Head (7,4). Body: (7,3), (7,2), (8,2).\nSo the enemy is surrounded by their own body downwards and to the right (8,2 is down-right, but 7,3 is directly down).\nActually, (7,3) is directly below (7,4). So the enemy cannot move DOWN.\n(8,3) is empty?\nThe enemy's body is (7,3) [Down], (7,2) [Down-Down], (8,2) [Right-Down-Down].\nSo the enemy is blocked DOWN by their own body.\nThey are NOT blocked RIGHT (8,4 is empty).\nThey are NOT blocked LEFT (6,4 is ME, so they are blocked LEFT by me).\nThey are NOT blocked UP (7,5 is empty).\n\n**CRITICAL ENEMY CONSTRAINTS:**\nThe enemy **CANNOT** move DOWN (into 7,3).\nThe enemy **CANNOT** move LEFT (into 6,4 where I am).\nThe enemy **CAN** only move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**MY MOVE CHOICES:**\n1.  **LEFT (5,4)**:\n    -   I move away from the enemy.\n    -   Enemy cannot move left to chase me immediately (they are blocked by me? No, if I leave, 6,4 is empty. But they have other constraints).\n    -   If I go LEFT, I open up the path to (3,3).\n    -   If I go LEFT, I leave the center. The enemy might go UP or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT, they head towards (8,0) or (9,6). If they go UP, they chase (5,7).\n\n2.  **DOWN (6,3)**:\n    -   I move towards (6,1) and (3,0).\n    -   (6,3) is empty.\n    -   If I go DOWN, I am at (6,3).\n    -   The enemy is at (7,4). They cannot move LEFT (I was there, but if I move DOWN, 6,4 becomes empty. They *could* move Left next turn).\n    -   If I go DOWN, I am getting closer to the bottom-left apples.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n(3,3) is worth 1 point. (6,1) is worth 1 point. (3,0) is worth 1 point.\n(3,3) requires Left/Down movement.\n(6,1) requires Down/Down/Down.\n(3,0) requires Left/Left/Down.\n\nFrom (6,4):\nTo (3,3): Left x3, Down x1. (Distance 4).\nTo (6,1): Down x3. (Distance 3).\nTo (3,0): Left x3, Down x4. (Distance 7).\n\nThe apple at (3,3) is the closest reachable apple that isn't directly adjacent to the enemy's likely path? (The enemy is going Right/Up).\nIf I go LEFT now, I am committing to the left side.\nIf I go DOWN, I am committing to the bottom side.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\nIf I go **LEFT**:\nEnemy options: UP or RIGHT.\n- If Enemy goes UP (7,5): Safe.\n- If Enemy goes RIGHT (8,4): Safe.\nNext turn:\n- If I am at (5,4), I can go DOWN to (5,3) towards (3,3).\n- If the Enemy went RIGHT, they are at (8,4). They are moving away from me.\n- If the Enemy went UP, they are at (7,5). They are moving away.\n\nIf I go **DOWN**:\nEnemy options: UP or RIGHT.\n- If Enemy goes UP (7,5): Safe.\n- If Enemy goes RIGHT (8,4): Safe.\nNext turn:\n- I am at (6,3). I can go LEFT to (5,3).\n- If Enemy went RIGHT (8,4), they are at x=8. I am at x=6.\n- If Enemy went UP (7,5), they are at y=5. I am at y=3.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-right corner (relative to me). They have limited moves. They cannot cross into my column easily because they have to deal with their own body.\nI am safe from immediate collision because the enemy has no path to me this turn (they are blocked LEFT and DOWN).\nI need to pick a direction that keeps my future options open.\n**LEFT (5,4)** moves me toward the large cluster of apples at (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9).\n**DOWN (6,3)** moves me toward (6,1) and (3,0), but isolates me from the top-left cluster.\n\nThe Top-Left cluster is safer because it's further from the enemy's current position (7,4). The enemy would have to traverse the whole board to get there.\nBy moving **LEFT**, I start claiming that territory.\n(3,3) is an apple on the way.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I stay close to the enemy's potential path if they decide to snake down the right side.\nIf I go LEFT, I am effectively separating the board.\n\n**LET'S GO LEFT!** Claim the territory.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nHead towards (3,3) -> (0,7) cluster. Control the left side. Keep the enemy pinned to the right. If they chase, we turn and fight when we have more mass.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",
