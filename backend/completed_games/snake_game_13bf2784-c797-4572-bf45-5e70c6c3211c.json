My head at (3,9). Opponent head at (1,1). Both snakes have no body segments (single-cell heads). Scores: 0\u20130.\n- Apples don't drive us; enemy does. Nearest apple to me: (1,8) (distance 3). Enemy is far down at (1,1) \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn.\n- Important: UP from (3,9) is OFF THE BOARD \u2014 insta-death. We MUST avoid that.\n\nConsider all four moves:\n- UP \u2192 illegal (would move to y=10). KILL. Eliminated.\n- DOWN \u2192 to (3,8). Safe: stays on board, not colliding with anyone. Improves centrality, increases future options (4 possible moves next turn), brings us closer to (1,8).\n- LEFT \u2192 to (2,9). Safe. Keeps us hugging the top row (top edge restricts UP), 3 follow-up options. Moves slightly toward (1,8).\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (4,9). Safe. Also hugs top row, 3 follow-up options. Moves away from the (1,8) apple.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- No immediate body collisions\u2014both snakes are lone heads. Opponent is far, so head-on this turn is unlikely. Since scores are tied, we should avoid risky head-ons and keep options open.\n- Moving DOWN centralizes us and gives more escape routes than LEFT/RIGHT along the top edge. That helps us avoid getting boxed in later and allows aggressive routing toward contested apples next few turns.\n\nShort-term move rationale (fans, listen close): go DOWN to get off the top edge, increase maneuverability, and start angling toward the (1,8) apple while keeping ability to pivot toward the opponent if they creep up. We want to be the one cutting off lanes, not getting cut off.\n\nLong-term plan (for next turns / to show back as last rationale):\n- Keep centralized and avoid edges until we can safely corral the opponent.\n- Prioritize apples near the opponent to pressure them, but only engage head-on if we have a clear score advantage.\n- Use our superior mobility from central positions to force the opponent into tight spaces and bait them into collisions or contested apples we can snatch.\n\nTime to move\u2014let's drop one cell and open up the board.

Moves us toward the enemy vertically, keeps options open centrally.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7): legal. Moves us toward the enemy horizontally, sets up the lateral cut I wanted last turn.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7): legal. Moves away \u2014 lame.\n\nImmediate-death filter: none of these moves hit walls or bodies \u2014 all safe. No self-collision risk (we have no body segments). Opponent at (1,3) is far; head-on next turn is unlikely from any of these moves.\n\nTactical choice: DOWN and LEFT both reduce Manhattan distance from 6 \u2192 5. I already pushed DOWN last turn to close vertical gap; now pivoting LEFT tightens the horizontal gap and starts to corral him toward the left side. That\u2019s how you force mistakes \u2014 cut off escape lanes, pressure him into a corner, and bait him into a risky move. Plus LEFT keeps multiple safe follow-ups (UP to contest the top row apple, DOWN to continue press, or continue LEFT to hem him in).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Keep closing from the left, aim to reduce his x to 0 while staying one step offset so a head-on swing kills him if he missteps.\n- Avoid hugging the absolute edge unless he\u2019s trapped; maintain at least one escape cell.\n- Force a corridor; if he chases apples, cut his path instead of giving chase.\n\nLet\u2019s bait him into a bad read and finish this quick \u2014 time to lean left, baby. \n\nLEFT",

DOWN/RIGHT are safer but miss the chance to force the win now.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to bait them into a downward challenge.

If we go RIGHT to (5,8), we can start controlling the center and limit their escape routes. We should aim to box them in near the left edge where they have limited movement options.

If the enemy is desperate they could try to meet us at (3,8) \u2014 that would be a head-on and we\u2019d win, but they might simply evade.\n- RIGHT (4,9): PURE PRESSURE. It forces the opponent to choose: go UP into (4,9) and we both collide (double KO) \u2014 but double KO = we WIN because we have 1 apple vs their 0. Or they flee and get boxed toward the open top corridor where we can chase and cut off.

If he goes UP and collides, double KO \u2192 we win the round.\n- If he flees, chase along the top row, box him between the wall and our body, only take apples that help seal the trap.\n- Avoid dropping down into tight corridors until the opponent is boxed or dead.\n\nTime to bully him.
