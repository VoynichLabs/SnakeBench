The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (1, 5).\nApples are at: (9, 5), (5, 2), (0, 2), (5, 6), (6, 3).\n\nMy immediate goal is to reach an apple quickly and safely.\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves from (7, 1):\n1. **UP to (7, 2):** Safe. No wall, no body, no current snake body. (7, 2) is a clear spot.\n2. **DOWN to (7, 0):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 1):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n\n**Analyzing proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (6, 3): Manhattan distance $1 + 2 = 3$.\n2. (5, 2): Manhattan distance $2 + 1 = 3$.\n3. (9, 5): Manhattan distance $2 + 4 = 6$.\n4. (0, 2): Manhattan distance $7 + 1 = 8$.\n5. (5, 6): Manhattan distance $2 + 5 = 7$.\n\nApples (6, 3) and (5, 2) are equally close in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\n**Evaluating moves based on distance reduction to targets:**\n\nTarget (6, 3):\n* UP (7, 2): Distance $1 + 1 = 2$. Reduction of 1.\n* DOWN (7, 0): Distance $1 + 3 = 4$. Increase of 1.\n* LEFT (6, 1): Distance $0 + 2 = 2$. Reduction of 1.\n* RIGHT (8, 1): Distance $2 + 2 = 4$. Increase of 1.\n\nTarget (5, 2):\n* UP (7, 2): Distance $2 + 0 = 2$. Reduction of 1.\n* DOWN (7, 0): Distance $2 + 2 = 4$. Increase of 1.\n* LEFT (6, 1): Distance $1 + 1 = 2$. Reduction of 1.\n* RIGHT (8, 1): Distance $3 + 1 = 4$. Increase of 1.\n\nBoth UP (to (7, 2)) and LEFT (to (6, 1)) are good starting directions, reducing distance to both closest apples.\n\n**Considering enemy Snake #0 at (1, 5):**\nEnemy snake is far away and currently heading towards apples like (0, 2) or (5, 6). It is highly unlikely to interfere with my immediate path towards (6, 3) or (5, 2).\n\n**Choosing the best first move:**\n\n* **Move UP (to (7, 2)):** This puts me one step away from the row containing (5, 2) and (6, 3). From (7, 2), I have good access to move LEFT towards (6, 3) or (5, 2).\n* **Move LEFT (to (6, 1)):** This puts me further west. From (6, 1), I would need to move UP to get closer to (6, 3) or (5, 2).\n\nMoving UP seems slightly more central relative to the two closest apples in the next turn, allowing flexibility. If I move UP, I am at (7, 2).\nFrom (7, 2), if I want (5, 2), I move LEFT twice. If I want (6, 3), I move LEFT once then UP once.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I am at (6, 1).\nFrom (6, 1), if I want (6, 3), I move UP twice. If I want (5, 2), I move UP once then LEFT once.\n\nBoth paths seem equally viable in terms of total turns to reach either apple (around 3 or 4 turns). Let's go with UP, prioritizing gaining Y-coordinate access to the 2nd and 3rd rows where the apples reside.\n\nPlan: Move UP towards the cluster of apples around (5, 2) and (6, 3). If the enemy moves quickly towards one of them, I can pivot to the other.\n\nUP",

Length 1.\n\n**Safety Check for moves from (7, 2):**\n1. **UP to (7, 3):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n2. **DOWN to (7, 1):** Safe. No wall, no body (this was the previous location of the head, but since the snake is length 1, that square is now empty).\n3. **LEFT to (6, 2):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at (2, 5)):**\nSnake #0 is likely targeting nearby apples: (0, 2), (5, 2), (5, 6), or perhaps (6, 3).\n* Distance to (0, 2): 2 + 3 = 5.

(Most dangerous path is RIGHT/UP)\n* Distance to (5, 2): 3 + 3 = 6.\n* Distance to (6, 3): 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nSnake #0 is highly likely to move towards (5, 6) or (0, 2). If it moves RIGHT, it will be at (3, 5). If it moves UP, it will be at (2, 6).\n\nThis confirms the enemy is far from my immediate targets ((6, 3) and (5, 2)) and collision risk is near zero this turn.\n\n**Analyzing Proximity to Apples from (7, 2):**\n\n1. **Target (6, 3):** Manhattan distance $1 + 1 = 2$.\n   * UP (7, 3): Distance $1 + 0 = 1$. (Eating the apple next turn if I choose UP then LEFT)\n   * DOWN (7, 1): Distance $1 + 2 = 3$. (Increases distance)\n   * LEFT (6, 2): Distance $0 + 1 = 1$. (Eating the apple next turn if I choose LEFT then UP)\n   * RIGHT (8, 2): Distance $2 + 1 = 3$. (Increases distance)\n\n2. **Target (5, 2):** Manhattan distance $2 + 0 = 2$.\n   * UP (7, 3): Distance $2 + 1 = 3$. (Increases distance)\n   * DOWN (7, 1): Distance $2 + 1 = 3$. (Increases distance)\n   * LEFT (6, 2): Distance $1 + 0 = 1$. (Eating the apple next turn if I choose LEFT then LEFT)\n   * RIGHT (8, 2): Distance $3 + 0 = 3$. (Increases distance)\n\n**Selecting the Best Move:**\n\nBoth UP and LEFT yield a minimum distance of 1 to one of the apples, meaning either apple can be reached in 2 turns total (including this one).\n\n* If I choose **LEFT to (6, 2)**:\n    * From (6, 2), I am 1 move from (5, 2) (LEFT) and 1 move from (6, 3) (UP). This offers maximum flexibility to grab either apple on the next turn.\n\n* If I choose **UP to (7, 3)**:\n    * From (7, 3), I am 1 move from (6, 3) (LEFT). I am 2 moves from (5, 2) (LEFT then LEFT). This commits me more strongly to (6, 3).\n\nSince (6, 3) is a slightly harder coordinate to reach quickly if I go strictly LEFT (it requires maneuvering around the apple at (5, 2) if I pass it), and (5, 2) is on a desirable path, moving LEFT seems slightly better as it keeps both apples equally viable for the next turn. (6, 2) is a direct neighbor to both the path to (5, 2) and the path to (6, 3).\n\nLet's commit to moving LEFT towards (6, 2).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 2):** From (6, 2), I will reassess. If the enemy seems to be heading towards (5, 2), I will take (6, 3) (by moving UP). Otherwise, I will likely take (5, 2) (by moving LEFT) as it opens up the center of the board better for future apples ((5, 6)).\n\nLEFT",

Length 1.\n* Enemy Snake (ID 0) Head: (3, 5). Length 1.\n* Apples: (9, 5), (5, 2), (0, 2), (5, 6), (6, 3).\n\nMy previous move was LEFT, bringing me from (7, 2) to (6, 2).\n\n**Short-Term Goal:** Secure one of the two closest apples: (5, 2) or (6, 3). Both are now 1 Manhattan distance away.\n\n**1. Safety Check for moves from (6, 2):**\n*   **UP to (6, 3):** Safe. This is an apple! No wall, no body.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe. No wall, no body.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. This is an apple! No wall, no body.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe. No wall, no body (this was the location of the previous head).\n\nAll four directions are safe from immediate self-collision or wall collision. Collision with Snake #0 is the only remaining threat.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis (Snake #0 at (3, 5)):**\nSnake #0 is far from my current location (3 units X difference, 3 units Y difference).\nEnemy targets:\n*   (5, 6): Distance 3 (right 2, up 1)\n*   (0, 2): Distance 6 (left 3, down 3)\n*   (5, 2): Distance 3 (right 2, down 3)\n*   (6, 3): Distance 5 (right 3, down 2)\n\nThe enemy is most likely to move towards (5, 6) or (5, 2).\nIf Snake #0 moves:\n*   UP to (3, 6): Distance to (5, 6) is 2.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 5): Distance to (5, 6) is 2. Distance to (5, 2) is 3.\n\nIt is highly unlikely for Snake #0 to reach (5, 2) or (6, 3) this turn or the next, as they are a minimum of 3 moves away for the enemy to reach an adjacent square, and I am 1 move away from eating them this turn. Collision risk is negligible.\n\n**3. Choosing the Best Move (Eating an apple):**\n\nI have two choices to eat an apple this turn: UP to (6, 3) or LEFT to (5, 2).\n\n*   **If I choose UP to (6, 3):**\n    *   I eat the apple, grow to length 2.\n    *   Future path: I am now on the right side of the board, at (6, 3). The next best apples are (5, 6) (3 moves away), (9, 5) (5 moves away), or (5, 2) (2 moves away, but requires moving around my new body).\n\n*   **If I choose LEFT to (5, 2):**\n    *   I eat the apple, grow to length 2.\n    *   Future path: I am now in the center-bottom, at (5, 2). The next best apples are (5, 6) (4 moves away) or (6, 3) (2 moves away, but may require moving around my new body). This position is more central and potentially better for pivoting to the upper part of the board.\n\nLet's look at the location of the apples relative to the ongoing path:\n(5, 2) is closer to the center of the board's vertical axis. Moving there keeps the option open to move straight UP towards (5, 6) eventually, or slightly RIGHT/UP towards (6, 3).\n(6, 3) is slightly higher up and more to the right.\n\nThe enemy Snake 0 is positioned at (3, 5). If they move RIGHT or UP, they threaten (5, 6) (4 distance) and (5, 2) (3 distance). Moving toward (5, 2) may be slightly risky if the enemy also targets it, but since I eat it this turn, the risk is zero.\n\nLet's pick **LEFT** to eat the apple at (5, 2). This centralizes my position.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 3):**\nMy head will be at (5, 2). My tail/body will be at (6, 2). I must now decide between continuing LEFT towards (0, 2) or moving UP towards (6, 3) or (5, 6).\n*   (6, 3) is 2 moves away (UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP).\n*   (5, 6) is 4 moves away (UP, UP, UP).\n*   (0, 2) is 5 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n\nGiven the enemy's proximity to (5, 6), I should probably prioritize (6, 3) via an UP move if available, which puts me exactly 1 move from (6, 3) in Turn 3. (If I move UP from (5, 2), I go to (5, 3). From (5, 3), I can hit (6, 3) by moving RIGHT.)\n\nLet's execute the move to eat the apple closest to the center: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Body check: (6, 2) is not (5, 3). Enemy check: H0 is at (3, 6), distance 3 away. Safe.)\n*   **DOWN to (5, 1):** Safe. (Wall check: Y=1 is fine. Body check: (6, 2) is not (5, 1). Safe.)\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe. (Wall check: X=4 is fine. Body check: (6, 2) is not (4, 2). Safe.)\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** **DANGER.** This is my tail segment. While moving onto the tail is often safe if the snake is non-growing (because the tail moves out), since this is *exactly* the adjacent segment, it's considered illegal/dangerous unless the game rules explicitly exclude moving onto the tail. Given standard Snake rules and the \"If you move onto any part of your body (including the cell directly behind your head), you die,\" this move is generally considered death if the tail doesn't immediately move out. Even if safe, it cornered motion. More importantly, this is the entire body segment for a length 2 snake. I must avoid (6, 2). **Eliminate RIGHT.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Target Selection and Pathing:**\n\nThe immediate, attractive target is (6, 3) (M.D. 2).\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (5, 3).**\n    *   From (5, 3), I am 1 unit away from (6, 3) (RIGHT move). This sets up an apple consumption next turn.\n    *   This path moves me towards the next-closest apple (5, 6).\n*   **Option B: Move LEFT to (4, 2).**\n    *   This leads towards the (0, 2) apple (4 moves away).\n    *   Distance to (6, 3) increases to 3 moves (UP, RIGHT, UP, or similar pathing around my body).\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (5, 1).**\n    *   This leads away from all high-value targets. Distance to (6, 3) is 3, distance to (5, 6) is 5. Less optimal.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis (Snake #0 at (3, 6)):**\n\nSnake #0's most likely targets are (5, 6) (M.D. 2) or (6, 3) (M.D. 3).\n\n*   If H0 moves RIGHT to (4, 6): M.D. to (5, 6) is 1. M.D. to (6, 3) is 3. Threatens (5, 6).\n*   If H0 moves UP to (3, 7): M.D. to (5, 6) is 3. M.D. to (6, 3) is 4. Less threatening.\n*   If H0 moves DOWN to (3, 5): M.D. to (5, 6) is 3. M.D. to (6, 3) is 4. Less threatening.\n\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (4, 6), they will likely snag (5, 6) on Turn 4. I cannot beat them to (5, 6).\n\nHowever, I can beat them to (6, 3).\nIf I move UP to (5, 3), regardless of where H0 moves, I can move RIGHT to (6, 3) on turn 4 and secure the apple.\n\n*   H1 path for (6, 3): (5, 2) -> (5, 3) [Turn 3] -> (6, 3) [Turn 4, Apple eaten]\n\nSince (6, 3) is guaranteed to be mine and (5, 6) is likely going to H0, moving UP is the optimal path.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 4):**\nHead will be at (5, 3). Move RIGHT to (6, 3) to eat the next apple. I will then be length 3, at (6, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2). Then I can pivot towards (9, 5) or (8, 8).\n\nUP",

(Not off board, not hitting body, not hitting the current enemy position, which is 3 squares away).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 2):** **DANGER.** This is my only body segment/tail. Since I moved UP last turn (from (5, 2) to (5, 3)), my tail remains at (5, 2). Moving back into it is immediate death. **Eliminate DOWN.**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3):** **Apple Consumption.** This is optimal, assuming no head collision.\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 6)):**\n\nThe enemy has multiple targets, including (5, 6) (M.D. 1) and (6, 3) (M.D. 3).\n\n**Possible Enemy Head (H0) moves this turn from (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Moving away from my target (6, 3). Safe for me.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Moving slightly towards my target (6, 3), but still 3 moves away. Safe for me.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Moving away from all high-value contested targets. Safe for me.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** H0 lands directly on the apple at (5, 6). This is the most likely move for the enemy, as it yields an apple immediately and is the closest target.\n\n**3. Head-on Collision Check for RIGHT move (to (6, 3)):**\n\n*   If H0 moves to (5, 6), there is no collision risk at (6, 3).\n*   Could H0 move to (6, 3)?\n    *   H0 is currently at (4, 6). To reach (6, 3) in one turn, H0 would need to move RIGHT twice and DOWN three times, which is impossible.\n    *   The only way H0 could reach (6, 3) is if H0 moved RIGHT to (5, 6) on Turn 4, and then RIGHT/DOWN/etc. on later turns. Head-on collision at (6, 3) on Turn 4 is *impossible*.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 3) is safe, immediately yields an apple, and expands my snake's length, setting me up for future dominance. This is the optimal move.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 5):**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 3), my snake will be: Head (6, 3), Body (5, 3), Tail (5, 2). Length 3.\nThe next closest apples are (9, 5) (M.D. 5) or (8, 8) (M.D. 7). The geographically closest other apple is (5, 6), which Snake #0 is likely taking this turn. If H0 misses (5, 6) and I take (6, 3), then (5, 6) becomes the priority. If H0 takes (5, 6), then (9, 5) is the primary target. I should likely move UP or RIGHT, heading towards the upper right quadrant quickly.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples: 0.\n    *   *Implicit assumption validation:* The enemy snake (ID 0) likely moved from (4, 6) to (4, 7) (UP). This is a suboptimal move for securing the closest apple (5, 6), but it did not directly interfere with my apple capture.\n*   Apples remaining: (9, 5), (0, 2), (5, 6), (8, 8), (9, 3).\n*   Closest Apples (Manhattan Distance from Head (6, 3)):\n    1.  (5, 6): MD 1 + 3 = 4 (Closest, but potentially contested)\n    2.  (9, 3): MD 3 + 0 = 3 (Wait, (9, 3) is 3 horizontal moves away. MD 3. This is the closest.)\n    3.  (9, 5): MD 3 + 2 = 5\n    4.  (8, 8): MD 2 + 5 = 7\n    5.  (0, 2): MD 6 + 1 = 7\n\n**Strategy:** The apple at (9, 3) is the new closest target (MD 3). The apple at (5, 6) is also close (MD 4), but the enemy is currently near it at (4, 7). Given the enemy's current position, moving towards the east side (9, 3) seems safer and directly leads to an apple.\n\n**1. Collision and Safety Check from (6, 3):**\n\n*   **Own Body Check:** My body is at (5, 3), (5, 2).\n*   **Enemy Check:** Snake #0 is at (4, 7).\n\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Safe.

(Moving directly towards (9, 3)).\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Target (9, 3):** Requires two RIGHT moves (to 8, 3 and 9, 3).\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (7, 3):** MD to (9, 3) becomes 2. Good progress.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (6, 2):** MD to (9, 3) becomes 4. Less optimal for (9, 3).\n*   **Target (5, 6):** Requires one LEFT move (to 5, 3 - impossible) and three UP moves.\n    *   **Move UP to (6, 4):** This keeps me moving generally towards the upper-right quadrant, which contains three apples ((9, 5), (8, 8), (5, 6)). MD to (5, 6) becomes 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 7)):**\n\nSnake #0's priority should be (5, 6) (MD 2) or (8, 8) (MD 4).\n\n*   **H0 likely moves to (5, 7) or (4, 6) or (4, 8):**\n    *   If H0 moves **RIGHT to (5, 7):** It becomes 1 move away from (5, 6), setting up a likely capture next turn.\n    *   If H0 moves **DOWN to (4, 6):** It moves away from (5, 6) (MD 3).\n    *   If H0 moves **UP to (4, 8):** Approaching (8, 8) (MD 4).\n\nSince the enemy is heavily positioned in the mid-left/top area, taking (9, 3) seems like the lowest conflict option.\n\n**4. Selecting Optimal Move:**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Moves me directly toward (9, 3) (MD 2 remaining). Safest, least contested action.\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Moves me toward the enemy's general area. While it could eventually lead to (5, 6) if the enemy misses it, it exposes me to potential future conflict.\n\nLet's prioritize the guaranteed isolated apple at (9, 3). Moving RIGHT to (7, 3) makes the most sense.\n\n**5. Head-on Collision Check for RIGHT move (to (7, 3)):**\nSnake #0 is at (4, 7). There is zero chance of collision moving to (7, 3).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move RIGHT to (7, 3) to secure the apple at (9, 3) in two more turns.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 6):**\nAfter moving to (7, 3), my snake will be: Head (7, 3), Body (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2). Length 4.\nThe next move will almost certainly be RIGHT to (8, 3), then to (9, 3) the turn after, unless a clear opportunity arises near the center board or an aggressive block is necessary.\n\nRIGHT",

(Moving directly towards (9, 3)).\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Target (9, 3):**\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (8, 3):** MD to (9, 3) becomes 1. Excellent progress. This sets up the capture in T+1.\n    *   **Move UP to (7, 4):** MD to (9, 3) becomes 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away from target.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (7, 2):** MD to (9, 3) becomes 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away from target.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 6)):**\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is currently positioned to go for (5, 6) (MD 1 away if it goes RIGHT to (5, 6)), or possibly (8, 8) (MD 6). Given the proximity of (5, 6), it is highly likely Snake #0 will try to capture it this turn.\n\n*   **H0 likely moves to (5, 6) (RIGHT, UP):**\n    *   If H0 moves **RIGHT to (5, 6)** (apple capture): H0 body is now (4, 6).\n    *   If H0 moves **UP to (4, 7):** MD to (5, 6) is 2.\n    *   If H0 moves **DOWN to (4, 5):** MD to (5, 6) is 2.\n\nWe are moving to (8, 3). Even if the enemy captures (5, 6), or moves to (5, 7) or (4, 7), the distance is large enough that collision is not a concern for move RIGHT to (8, 3).\n\n**4. Selecting Optimal Move:**\n\nRIGHT to (8, 3) is the optimal move. It directly advances toward the target apple (9, 3), minimizing the travel time for the next capture and keeping my snake safe and away from the enemy's operational area.\n\n**5. Head-on Collision Check for RIGHT move (to (8, 3)):**\nSnake #0 is at (4, 6). They cannot reach (8, 3) in one turn. Safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move RIGHT.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 7):**\nAfter moving to (8, 3), my snake will be: Head (8, 3), Body (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3). Length 4.\nThe next move will be RIGHT to (9, 3) to capture the apple, increasing length to 5 and apple count to 3.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples: 2.\n    *   *Self-Correction*: Length of my snake is 3 (Head + 2 body segments). My previous rationale suggested length 4 after the last move, which was incorrect as the growth happens *after* eating. Since I have eaten 2 apples, I should have length 3 + 2 = 5 if the initial length was 3, or length 1 + 2 = 3 if the current stated body is correct and the game initializes based on captured apples for length.\n    *   Looking at the board output: Snake ID 1 (T) at (7, 3) and (6, 3) + Head (1) at (8, 3). Total visible segments: 3. This matches the length 3 stated in the input. *Note: The description says \"Apples collected: 2\". This confirms my initial length must have been 1, and I ate 2, meaning my current length must be 3.*\n*   Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head at (3, 6). Body: none. Length 1.

It moved LEFT.\n*   Apples remaining: (9, 5), (0, 2), (5, 6), (8, 8), (9, 3).\n*   Targeting: I am now at (8, 3), directly adjacent to the apple at (9, 3).\n\n**Strategy Focus:** Capture the immediate apple at (9, 3). This is a safe move and guarantees my 3rd apple point.\n\n**1. Collision and Safety Check from (8, 3):**\n\n*   **Board Boundaries & Body Check:**\n    *   UP to (8, 4): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (8, 2): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 3): **DANGER.** This is the cell immediately behind my head (body segment). **Eliminate LEFT.**\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 3): Safe. (This cell contains an Apple A).\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 3):** I capture the apple. My length increases to 4. My score increases to 3. This is the optimal move.\n*   **Move UP to (8, 4):** Moves away from the target. MD to (9, 3) becomes 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 2):** Moves away from the target. MD to (9, 3) becomes 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 6)):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 6). It previously moved LEFT.\nClosest apples for H0:\n1. (5, 6): MD 2 (RIGHT, RIGHT)\n2. (0, 2): MD 3 + 4 = 7\n3. (8, 8): MD 5 + 2 = 7\n\nSnake #0 is highly likely to move towards (5, 6).\nPossible moves for H0:\n*   RIGHT to (4, 6): MD to (5, 6) is 1. (Expected)\n*   UP to (3, 7): MD to (5, 6) is 3.\n*   DOWN to (3, 5): MD to (5, 6) is 3.\n*   LEFT to (2, 6): MD to (5, 6) is 3.\n\nNo matter where H0 moves, it is far away from (9, 3). A head-on collision at (9, 3) is impossible.\n\n**4. Selecting Optimal Move:**\n\nThe optimal move is RIGHT to capture the apple at (9, 3).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 8 onwards):**\nAfter capturing (9, 3), my head will be at (9, 3). My body will be (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3). Length 4.\nRemaining apples: (9, 5), (0, 2), (5, 6), (8, 8).\nFrom (9, 3):\n1. (9, 5): MD 2 (UP, UP)\n2. (8, 8): MD 1 + 5 = 6\n3. (5, 6): MD 4 + 3 = 7\n4. (0, 2): MD 9 + 1 = 10\n\nThe next target should be (9, 5) which is two moves directly UP. Snake #0 is moving towards (5, 6), so getting (9, 5) first seems safe and efficient.\n\nRIGHT",

Collision and Safety Check from H1 (9, 5):**\n\n*   **Board Boundaries & Body Check:**\n    *   UP to (9, 6): Safe.

A5 (2, 7): MD 1 + 2 = 3 (RIGHT 1, UP 2)\n\nH0 likely targets A5 (2, 7) or A4 (0, 2).\nPossible moves for H0 from (1, 5):\n*   UP to (1, 6): Safe. Reduces MD to A5 (2, 7) to 3 (or 4 to A3 (5, 6)). Good move.\n*   DOWN to (1, 4): Safe. Increases MD to all central/upper apples. Less likely.\n*   LEFT to (0, 5): Safe. Reduces MD to A4 (0, 2) to 3. Good move.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 5): Safe. Reduces MD to A5 (2, 7) to 2. Very good move.\n\nMy target (8, 5) is far from Snake #0, so there is no risk of collision.\n\n**3. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 5):** Optimal move. Captures the apple A1.\n*   **Move UP to (9, 6):** Safe, but moves away from A1 (8, 5). Only useful if A1 were somehow blocked or dangerous.\n\n**4. Selecting Optimal Move:**\n\nLEFT ensures the capture of the second apple in my current cluster (A1 at (9, 5) was captured last turn, A5 at (8, 5) is captured this turn).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 11 onwards):**\nIf I move LEFT, my head will be at (8, 5). I will have 5 apples and length 6.\nRemaining apples: (8, 8), (5, 6), (0, 2), (2, 7).\nFrom (8, 5):\n1. A2 (8, 8): MD 3 (UP 3). This is the next primary target.\n2.

(Note: The actual current length based on the body list provided (5 segments) and the head (1 segment) is 6, but since the previous move resulted in an apple capture, the body list displayed here must be the segments *before* the growth/tail movement. Assuming the length is now 7 total: Head (8, 5) + 6 segments [TBD]). Let's strictly use the provided state: Head (8, 5), Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3)].

Collision and Safety Check from H1 (8, 5):**\n\n*   **Board Boundaries & Body Check:**\n    *   UP to (8, 6): Safe. Moves closer to A3 (8, 8).\n    *   DOWN to (8, 4): Safe. (7, 3) is the tail, (8, 3) is a body segment.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 5): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 5): **DANGER.** This is the first body segment (neck). **Eliminate RIGHT.**\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2.

A2 (5, 6): MD 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nH0 likely targets A1 (0, 2) or A4 (2, 7).\nPossible moves for H0 from (0, 5):\n*   UP to (0, 6): Safe. Moves away from A1 (0, 2).\n*   DOWN to (0, 4): Safe. Moves closer to A1 (0, 2). Highly likely.\n*   LEFT to (-1, 5): DANGER (Off board).\n*   RIGHT to (1, 5): Safe. Moves towards A4 (2, 7).\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (0, 4), it continues towards A1.\nMy snake is far away (8, 5), so there is no immediate collision risk from the enemy head or body expansion.\n\n**3. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 6):** Optimal move. Reduces distance to A3 (8, 8) by 1. Distance remains 2.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 4):** Moves away from all nearby targets. Not ideal unless necessary for space/safety (not needed here).\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 5):** Moves away from A3 (8, 8). Increases distance to 4.\n\n**4. Selecting Optimal Move:**\n\nUP is the clear path to capture the next apple, A3 (8, 8), in two subsequent moves (Turn 12 to (8, 7), Turn 13 to (8, 8)).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 12 onwards):**\nHead at (8, 6). Target (8, 8). Continue moving UP.\nIf A3 (8, 8) is captured (Turn 13), H1 will be at (8, 8). Next targets: A2 (5, 6) (MD 5) or A5 (5, 9) (MD 4).
