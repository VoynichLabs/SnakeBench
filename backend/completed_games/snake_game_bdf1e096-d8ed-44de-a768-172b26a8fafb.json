Less useful.\n- **DOWN to (6, 7)**: Moves toward the middle/lower part of the board. The apple at (5, 6) is relatively close in this direction. This seems promising.\n- **LEFT to (5, 8)**: Moves me toward the center-left. Apples at (3, 2), (1, 7), (3, 1) are in that general direction. This puts me on a path toward (1, 7) which is close.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: Moves me right, toward the apple at (7, 0). However, this is quite far down and moving right limits my future flexibility.\n\n**Best Move:**\nThe apple at (5, 6) is quite close (one move down from my current position gets me closer). Alternatively, the apple at (1, 7) is also nearby if I move left.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 8) keeps me central and opens up multiple paths to nearby apples. It also keeps maximum flexibility and doesn't box me into a corner.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 7) gets me closer to the (5, 6) apple directly.\n\nBetween these, **DOWN** is more direct - I can potentially reach (5, 6) in 2 moves total (DOWN to 6,7, then LEFT to 5,7, then LEFT to 5,6). This seems like a strong early apple capture.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:**\nFocus on the (5, 6) apple as the first target - it's closest. After that, sweep toward (3, 2) or (3, 1). Avoid the enemy snake - stay aware of its position and never let it trap me.\n\nDOWN",

Less strategic.\n- **DOWN to (6, 6)**: Moves closer to the apple at (5, 6). This is just one step away horizontally. Very promising!

It's safe (away from enemy)\n2. It positions me right next to the apple at (5, 6) for next turn\n3. It maintains flexibility - from (6, 6) I can move in multiple directions\n4. It keeps distance from the enemy snake\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nAfter eating the apple at (5, 6), pivot toward collecting apples at (3, 2) and (3, 1). Watch the enemy snake's movements carefully - if it tries to block, I have alternatives. The apple at (7, 0) is also reachable but seems lower priority.

The enemy snake is also at (4, 6), which is 2 cells to the left of me. Both snakes are on the same row.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n- Moving LEFT would put me at (5, 6), which eats the apple AND moves me one step closer to the enemy at (4, 6)\n- The enemy is unlikely to move RIGHT into me (that would be poor strategy for them)\n- If the enemy moves DOWN or UP, they move away from this row\n- If the enemy moves LEFT, they go to (3, 6), still not threatening me at (5, 6)\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT, they go to (5, 6)... wait, that's where I'd be moving!\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 6), we'd have a head-on collision and both die. This is a real risk given that:\n1. There's an apple at (5, 6) that the enemy might also want\n2. The enemy could see the same strategic value\n\nHowever, the enemy is at (4, 6), which is an odd position. They probably moved there for a reason - likely pursuing the apple at (5, 6) or (3, 2). If they're thinking strategically, they might move LEFT toward (3, 6) or (3, 2).\n\n**Safe Move Analysis:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (5, 6)**: Eats apple, but risky if enemy moves RIGHT\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: Safe, moves away from enemy and apple\n3. **UP to (6, 7)**: Safe, moves away from the immediate row\n4. **DOWN to (6, 5)**: Safe, moves away from the immediate row\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe apple at (5, 6) is right next to me, but the collision risk is real. Let me be more cautious and move **UP** to (6, 7). This:\n- Keeps me safe from any immediate threats\n- Positions me to potentially intercept the apple at (1, 7) or move toward other apples\n- Maintains board flexibility\n- Avoids the risky head-on collision scenario\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving up, I'll assess the enemy's position and the apple distribution. The apples at (3, 2) and (3, 1) form a cluster that I can target. The apple at (1, 7) is also on row 7 where I'll be.

The large cluster at (8, 7) and (8, 8) is still 6+ cells away.\n\nLet me evaluate the viable moves:\n\n- **UP to (2, 9)**: Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 9). This could be efficient - I'd be at y=9 (max row), then move right to reach (5, 9) quickly. After eating that apple, I'd still have room to maneuver.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 8)**: Continues the previous strategy toward (8, 7) and (8, 8), but these are farther away (6-7 cells). The apple at (5, 9) is closer.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 7)**: Moves away from the nearest apple at (5, 9), not strategic.\n\n**Optimal Move:**\nMoving UP to (2, 9) positions me to grab the apple at (5, 9) quickly. From (2, 9), I can move RIGHT 3 times to reach (5, 9) and collect that apple. This is more efficient than continuing right toward the distant (8, 7)-(8, 8) cluster.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (5, 9), I'll have options:\n- Continue right to (8, 8) or (8, 7)\n- Go down to other apples\n- Maintain flexibility\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 1) is far away and unlikely to interfere.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n1. Move UP this turn to (2, 9)\n2. Move RIGHT next turn to (3, 9)\n3. Continue RIGHT to reach (5, 9) apple\n4. After collecting (5, 9), reassess positions and move toward the (8, 7)-(8, 8) cluster or bottom apples depending on enemy positions and snake growth\n\nUP",

Safe, but takes me away from nearby apples. Not ideal.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 7)**: This moves me directly onto an apple! The apple at (8, 7) is right below me. I would:\n   - Grow to length 5\n   - Tie the score at 5-4 (actually taking the lead since I'll have 5)\n   - My new body would be [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]\n   - The enemy at (8, 6) is moving simultaneously. It will move to one of: up (8, 7), down (8, 5), left (7, 6), or right (9, 6). Given the pattern, enemy likely continues its vertical movement pattern. If it goes UP to (8, 7), we'd have a head-on collision! But the enemy snake's previous moves suggest vertical up-and-down pattern.\n   \n   Wait, let me reconsider. The enemy is at (8, 6). If I move DOWN to (8, 7), and the enemy moves UP from (8, 6), we both end up on (8, 7) - that's a head-on collision and both of us die! But I'd be tied at 5-4, so I'd win. However, the problem says if both die on the same turn, the one with more apples wins. At 5-4, I win even if we collide!\n   \n   Actually, re-reading: \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n   \n   So if we collide at (8, 7), I'd have 5 apples and the enemy would have 4, so I'd win! This is a winning move!\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 8)**: Blocked by my own body. Death. \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 8)**: Safe. Moves toward (9, 7) apple. Good escape route, but doesn't guarantee the immediate win.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (8, 7) is the best move because:\n- If the enemy moves UP (which seems likely given their vertical movement), we collide and I win 5-4\n- If the enemy moves in any other direction, I safely grab the apple and take a 5-4 lead\n- Either way, I'm in a winning position\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nIf I survive this turn (i.e., enemy doesn't move up), I'll be at (8, 7) with 5 apples. Next priorities:\n- Move toward (9, 7) to grab another apple\n- Maintain distance from enemy snake\n- Continue aggressive apple collection to build a lead\n- Monitor enemy position to avoid traps\n\nDOWN",

Once at lower y-levels, navigate LEFT to systematically collect apples while maintaining distance from enemy snake at (4,2).

However, this puts me on a collision path if the enemy moves up.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 6)**: Moves me away from the main apple cluster and toward (7,4), which is relatively far and isolated.\n\n**Key Observation:** The enemy head at (4, 1) is positioned to potentially intercept apples at (0,1), (2,1). If I want those apples, I need to move decisively. However, I need to be careful about head-on collisions.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6) and the enemy goes UP from (4, 1), they'd be at (4, 2) next turn - no collision. But if they continue UP toward me, we could meet.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5, 5) keeps me in a safer vertical path. The enemy is unlikely to move right (away from apples) and then up to my column. This move maintains flexibility and continues toward the apple zone.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving down and left in a careful pattern to reach the apple cluster at (0,1), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3). Stay vigilant about the enemy head position at (4,1) - they're now in the apple zone. Try to intercept apples they might miss or get to the left-side apples (0,1) before they can.

Gets me closer to row 4/3/1 area. Next turn I could continue down or move left. This maintains flexibility.\n\n- **LEFT to (4, 5)**: Moves me horizontally left. This is directly toward the apple cluster horizontally. However, I need to go down significantly (5 rows) to reach the y=1 and y=3 apples.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 5)**: Moves me toward (7, 4) apple. This is the isolated apple on the right side. Less efficient since the lower-left cluster has 4 apples.\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 1). If they move UP next turn, they'd be at (3, 2). If they move RIGHT, they'd be at (4, 1). If they move LEFT, they'd be at (2, 1) (eating an apple). No immediate head-on collision risk with any of my safe moves.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nGoing DOWN keeps me in a vertical path toward the apple zone. This allows me flexibility to curve left when I'm closer to the target apples. The enemy is mostly occupying the lower-left area, but I can compete for apples by timing my moves carefully.\n\n**Long-term Strategy for Next Turns:**\nContinue moving DOWN and LEFT toward the apple cluster at (0,1), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3). Monitor the enemy's position closely - they're at (3,1) which is prime apple-hunting territory. Be prepared to curve around them or pursue different apples based on their movements. The (7,4) apple is a backup option if the lower cluster becomes too contested. Maintain space and avoid getting trapped against board edges.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is at (2, 1), which is near the apple at (0, 1). There are several apple clusters:\n- Bottom-left: (0, 1) - CLOSE to enemy\n- Middle-left cluster: (2, 3), (3, 3)\n- Right side: (7, 4)\n- Top: (2, 9)\n\n**Direction Evaluation:**\n\n- **DOWN to (5, 3)**: Moves me toward row 3. From here, I could reach (3, 3) or (2, 3) by moving LEFT. This is reasonable but the enemy is already competing in this zone.\n\n- **LEFT to (4, 4)**: Moves me horizontally leftward. Gets me closer to the (3, 3) and (2, 3) apples. This is a good competitive move toward the middle-left cluster.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 4)**: Moves me rightward toward (7, 4). This apple is isolated and could be a good target since the enemy isn't competing there.\n\n**Collision Risk Analysis:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 1). They're likely to move UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. If they move UP to (2, 2), they'll be heading toward the (2, 3) or (3, 3) cluster. Moving RIGHT to (3, 4) would put them at (3, 1) then potentially (3, 2) or beyond. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Best Move:**\nMoving RIGHT toward (7, 4) is strategic because:\n1. It's an uncontested apple on the right side\n2. The enemy is focused on the left side (head at (2, 1))\n3. It keeps me away from direct competition\n4. From (6, 4), I can easily reach (7, 4) next turn\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nContinue RIGHT to grab the (7, 4) apple, then reassess based on remaining apples and enemy position. Once I secure that apple, I'll have 7 apples and can compete for the remaining cluster or the top apple at (2, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps me away from the enemy who is positioned on the left side\n\nThe enemy at (2, 2) is unlikely to reach (7, 4) quickly, so this apple is effectively mine for the taking.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter eating (7, 4), I'll have tied the score at 7-7. I should then:\n1. Move toward the isolated apple at (7, 4) area or pivot back toward the middle cluster (2, 3), (3, 3)\n2. Monitor enemy position - they're currently at (2, 2) and likely competing for the left-side apples\n3. The apple at (2, 9) is high value but requires careful navigation\n4.

Move toward apples they won't reach first\n\n**Evaluating the three safe moves:**\n\n- **LEFT**: Would die into my body\n- **DOWN to (7, 3)**: Takes me down and slightly away from immediate apple clusters. Could be vulnerable if I continue down (edge is at y=0).\n- **RIGHT to (8, 4)**: Takes me to the right edge, potentially limiting future options and moving away from apples.\n- **UP to (7, 5)**: Moves me upward. This allows me to potentially navigate toward (2, 9) or reposition to compete for middle apples. Keeps central positioning.\n\n**Move Rationale:**\n\nUP seems safest because:\n1. It keeps me in the middle of the board with flexible options\n2. It doesn't trap me at the edges\n3. It allows me to pivot toward any of the remaining apples\n4. The enemy at (2, 3) is heading toward (3, 3) likely, so moving up gives me options to either intercept or find alternate apples\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFocus on reaching (2, 9) via a path that doesn't put me in direct collision with the enemy. They seem focused on the lower-left quadrant. I should move north to get into position for (2, 9), which is high-value and potentially accessible.\n\nUP",

I need to catch up and reach 50 before the enemy does. Let me evaluate each safe move:\n\n- **DOWN**: Immediate death into my own body. Eliminated.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 5)**: Moves me toward my own body tail area. This could trap me or limit options. The apple at (1, 6) is to the left, but moving left here doesn't make efficient progress toward it.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 5)**: Moves me right toward the apple at (9, 1). However, this takes me toward the edge and doesn't help much with other closer apples.\n\n- **UP to (7, 6)**: Moves me upward. From here, I can continue toward (2, 9) which is a valuable apple. The enemy is at (3, 3) and seems to be in the lower portion of the board. Moving up keeps me away from the enemy and positions me to compete for the top apples.\n\n**Path Analysis:**\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is in the upper-left area. My head at (7, 5) moving UP to (7, 6) puts me on a trajectory toward that apple. The enemy is at (3, 3), which is far from (2, 9), so there's less direct competition there.\n\nThe apple at (1, 6) is also interesting\u2014it's relatively close and in a good position. Moving UP allows me to eventually curve left toward (1, 6) or continue to (2, 9).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nUP is the best move because:\n1. It keeps me safe (not into my body or off-board)\n2. It moves me toward high-value apples at the top (2, 9)\n3. It keeps me away from the enemy's current location\n4. It maintains flexibility for multiple future paths\n5. It doesn't trap me at an edge\n\n**Note to Future Self:**\nAfter moving UP, continue pursuing (2, 9) by moving left and up. The enemy is behind us in terms of positioning for that apple. If you reach (2, 9), you'll gain valuable distance. Watch for the enemy's position and adjust if they start heading the same direction.\n\nUP",

Let me evaluate which is better:\n\n- **UP to (6, 7)**: Moves toward the apple at (2, 9). This is a valuable apple. Distance to (2, 9) is about 5 cells away diagonally. This move starts me on a path toward a high-value apple.\n\n- **DOWN to (6, 5)**: Moves away from nearby apples. The closest would be (5, 0), which is still far away (Manhattan distance 6). This seems less efficient.\n\nI'm down 7-9 in apples and need to catch up. Moving UP toward (2, 9) makes sense strategically. The apple at (1, 6) that I was targeting is now blocked by my own body, so I need to pivot my strategy.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move UP to (6, 7)\n2. Continue moving toward (2, 9) - this is a high-value target\n3. After collecting (2, 9), reassess the board and move toward other nearby apples\n4.

This is excellent progress.\n\nAfter LEFT, my next move DOWN to (2, 8) would be safe and continue good positioning.\n\nThe enemy head is at (3, 7). If I move LEFT to (2, 9), the enemy could theoretically move to (2, 7) or (3, 8). If enemy moves UP to (3, 8) and I move LEFT to (2, 9), we won't collide.\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is my most immediate target. After collecting it, I can work toward (0, 1) or pivot toward other apples. The board still has space and I need to gain apples quickly since the enemy has 10 to my 8.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turns:**\n1. Turn 44 (this move): LEFT to (2, 9) - collect apple (9 apples)\n2. Turn 45: DOWN to (2, 8) - continue clearing the top-left area\n3. Turn 46: LEFT to (1, 8) or DOWN to (2, 7) depending on enemy position\n4. Goal: Navigate toward (0, 1) to collect more apples\n5. Keep monitoring enemy snake - it's moving slower but has more apples\n6. Aim to collect 50 apples before enemy does (need 42 more, they need 40 more)\n\nLEFT",

I'm at turn 45/150, so 105 turns remain.\n\nLet me evaluate the safe moves:\n\n- **LEFT to (1, 9)**: This moves me toward the top-left corner. From there, I could go DOWN to (1, 8), (1, 7), etc. However, this might trap me in a corner with limited apple access.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 8)**: This continues moving down the left side of the board. The nearest apples from here are (0, 1) below me and to the left. This keeps more of the board accessible and allows me to navigate toward multiple apples.\n\nLooking at apple positions:\n- (0, 1): Bottom-left, 2 moves left and 8 moves down from my current position\n- (5, 0): Center-bottom\n- (9, 1): Right side\n- (8, 8): Right side, near enemy\n- (8, 7): Right side, near enemy\n\nThe most strategic apple for me to target is **(0, 1)** - it's relatively isolated and I can reach it without fighting for space with the enemy snake. Going DOWN helps me move in that direction while keeping options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. Turn 45 (this move): DOWN to (2, 8) - heading toward (0, 1)\n2. Turn 46-48: Continue DOWN toward row 1, staying on the left side\n3. Turn 49-50: Move LEFT to reach (0, 1) and collect the apple\n4. After that: Reassess based on remaining apple positions and enemy movement\n5. Maintain awareness of the enemy's apple count; if they get to 45+ apples, I need to accelerate apple collection\n\nDOWN",

The enemy body is at [(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6)]. Yes, (1, 7) is occupied by enemy body. \u274c DEATH\n\n**Safe moves: Only DOWN**\n\nDOWN is the only safe move available. This continues my path toward the apple at (0, 1), which is 6 cells away directly south. The path is clear:\n- (0, 6) empty\n- (0, 5) empty\n- (0, 4) empty\n- (0, 3) empty\n- (0, 2) empty\n- (0, 1) apple!\n\nAfter collecting that apple at (0, 1), I'll be tied at 10 apples with the enemy. I need to focus on securing additional apples to pull ahead.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nContinue DOWN to (0, 1) to collect the apple and tie the score at 10-10. After that, pivot toward (5, 0) to continue collecting apples. Monitor the enemy's position carefully - they're currently at (3, 8) and may move toward the eastern apples at (8, 8) or (8, 7). Stay aware of potential head-on collisions while prioritizing apple collection.\n\nDOWN",
