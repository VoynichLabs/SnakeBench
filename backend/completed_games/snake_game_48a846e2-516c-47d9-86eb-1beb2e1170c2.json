However, that's out of reach in a single move, and it's also too far down. Plus, I have a gap to the right, which I should aim to fill.\n\nLet's try to move to the apple at (7, 8, no, wait, there are two apples there!), (7, 8) and (7, 7), and choose the one that's closer. Hmm, (7, 8) is just as accessible as (7, 7), but moving right and then up is a consistent strategy.\n\nMy first goal is to get to a position where I can eat an apple and grow. Let's aim for an apple-picking position. My current options are: UP isn't an option, it'll move me into the wall; I'll choose RIGHT.\n\nNext turn, I'll need to think about focusing on food, not going backward, not bumping into the other snake, and making good progress up the board to take advantage of my growing size-population to score more points.\n\nI'll squeeze through those apples with ease, always keeping an apple within reach.\n\nRIGHT.",

My main goal now is to head up the board, but not too quickly, since I want to avoid bumping into the other snake.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple is closer to me at the position (7, 8) and (7, 7). Since I moved right, I'm now at (2, 8), which means the apple at (7, 7) might be closer to me vertically. However, both apples require me to move up to the same y-coordinate, so I guess they are the same distance away vertically. I'll pick left to get closer to the apple.\n\nWait, hold on, I can pick either one, (7, 7) or (7, 8), they're equidistant. Since I moved right last turn, let's head up towards 7 this turn, then I can decide which apple I'll go for when I reach that column.\n\nLet's get into position to move up to the y-coordinate of 7 and choose an apple. \n\nI'll choose to move right first since my new x-coordinate needs to be higher (increase). Then I can decide my next move when I reach the desired x-coordinate.\n\nHowever, my real next move would be UP to get closer to a y-coordinate where I can eat an apple. But my x-coordinate must first increase, and I can use this new increased x-coordinate to decide whether I should aim higher vertically or horizontally.\n\nMy next x-coordinate should be the higher one.
