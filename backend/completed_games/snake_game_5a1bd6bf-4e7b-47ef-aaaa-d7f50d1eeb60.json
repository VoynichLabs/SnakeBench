Not a priority.\n\n- RIGHT (5,3): Empty, apple at (5,1), but that is two steps south, so not immediate gain and going RIGHT may move me farther from apples for now.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,2) will get me an apple immediately, increasing points by 1, and is close to my current position. The risk is being near enemy snake at (4,1), so I have to be careful next turn.\n\nAfter I take the apple at (4,2), the next strategic focus could be:\n\n- Moving UP to (4,3), then UP again to (4,4) and (4,5) to get the apple at (4,5).\n- Or moving sideways depending on enemy actions.\n\n**Next move decision:**\n\nI will move **DOWN** to (4,2) to get the apple immediately.\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\nBe cautious of the enemy snake at (4,1).

There's no apple at (8,4) or (8,3) listed, so that was an inconsistency in the last analysis.

The enemy could move UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,4), depending on their strategy.\n\nYou want to avoid head-to-head collisions and also pick apples safely.\n\nThe closest apple is at (4,5), distance 3 to the left.\n\nQuestion: should you try to backtrack left toward (4,5), or head towards (7,0) moving down, or move up toward the apples at (4,9) and (6,9)? \n\nLet's check possible safe moves:\n\n- UP to (7,6): safe, good for moving toward top cluster of apples at (4,9) and (6,9).\n\n- DOWN to (7,4): this leads closer to enemy snake at (8,4), which could be risky.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5): next to enemy snake at (8,4), risky.\n\n- LEFT to (6,5): your own body segment, moving backward is illegal.\n\nSo LEFT is out.\n\nBetween UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n\n- DOWN is risky because enemy snake is at (8,4) and might move to (7,4) or (8,5), threatening you.\n\n- RIGHT is risky for the same reason: moving adjacent to enemy snake's head.\n\n- UP is safest and moves you towards the apples at top.\n\nTherefore, moving UP (7,6) looks like the safest move and can help you reach the apples at (6,9) and (4,9) eventually.\n\n**Next turn plan:** From (7,6), evaluate moving toward (6,9) by moving UP until y=9, then moving LEFT toward apples at (6,9) and (4,9).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP"

The closest seems to be (8,5) or (7,2) since they are relatively near.\n\n- However, your body is along column 4 descending down, so moving straight up along column 4 could lead into enemy or congested space near their head.\n\n- Enemy snake head is at (3,9), so potentially moving up to (4,7), (4,8), (4,9) may lead you close to the enemy.\n\n- Apples on the bottom half of the board at (7,0), (0,2), and (4,0) (already eaten) are far.\n\n---\n\n### Danger analysis:\n\n- Moving **UP** to (4,7) collides with your own extended body only if you loop back, which is not the case now.\n\n- Enemy snake is mostly on the top row and near (4,9), so a direct UP path might cause you to enter contested or dangerous space.\n\n- The apple at (8,5) is on the same row as your current head y=6, but at x=8, so you need to move right to reach it.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- It might be best to start moving RIGHT to reach the apple at (8,5).\n\n- However, you must be cautious to not trap yourself or head into enemy territory.\n\n---\n\n### Possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- **UP** to (4,7) is open but moves you towards enemy.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (5,6) brings you closer to apple (8,5).\n\n- **LEFT** to (3,6) is open but no apples nearby.\n\n- **DOWN** to (4,5) would be moving back onto your body, invalid move.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n\n- Since last move was UP, your body is now in (4,6) to (4,3). Moving back DOWN on (4,5) would collide with your own body.\n\n- To avoid danger near top and get closer to apple at (8,5), moving RIGHT seems safer.\n\n---\n\n**Next move:** RIGHT\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**  \n- Head RIGHT gradually towards (8,5).  \n- Avoid getting too close to enemy snake near top edge.  \n- If path upwards becomes blocked near enemy, consider circling around or going down later to pursue apples near bottom.  \n- Maintain space from own body to avoid trapping."

This move avoids self-collision, keeps the snake away from the enemy's vicinity, and positions it favorably for future maneuvers towards available apples.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- **Explore the Left Side:** Begin navigating towards the left to access apples like (0, 2) while maintaining ample space to maneuver.\n- **Monitor Enemy Movement:** Keep an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid potential conflicts.\n- **Plan Path Efficiently:** Ensure that each move keeps escape routes open, preventing the snake from becoming trapped as it grows longer.\n\n**Next Move:** **LEFT**"
