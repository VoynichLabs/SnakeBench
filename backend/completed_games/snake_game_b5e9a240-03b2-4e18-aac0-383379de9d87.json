Yes, no collision with borders, enemy, or self\n   - This gets me closer to (6, 7) and keeps me near apples at (8, 2) and (8, 1)\n\n2. **DOWN**: Head would move to (5, 0)\n   - Safe?

Move RIGHT this turn to start harvesting that cluster. Avoid the upper left area where the enemy snake is more likely to be. Keep distance from enemy while maximizing apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",
