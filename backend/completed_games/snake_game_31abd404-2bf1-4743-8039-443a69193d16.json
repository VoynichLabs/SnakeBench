Let me break down this critical moment!\n\nCurrent state:\n- My snake at (3,7) - I'm one cell from the top wall!\n- Enemy at (2,8) - he's above and to the left of me!\n- We're TIED at 1 apple each - this is a WAR!\n\nLet me check my options:\n- UP: (3,8) - safe, open path, no body there\n- DOWN: (3,6) - safe, open path, no body there\n- LEFT: (2,7) - BUT WAIT! That's where the ENEMY'S head will be at (2,8) after he moves up! If we both go there, it's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!\n- RIGHT: (4,7) - safe, open path, no body there\n\nOkay, LEFT is immediately risky - it's a potential head-on collision with the enemy! But remember, if I have MORE apples (I don't - we're tied), I'd win in a double KO! This is a GAMBLE!\n\nRemaining safe moves:\n- UP to (3,8) - moves me up toward the top wall\n- DOWN to (3,6) - moves me down toward the center\n- RIGHT to (4,7) - moves me toward the right wall\n\nThe enemy is at (2,8) - he's directly above and to the left. This is a CRITICAL moment!\n\nLet me think strategically:\n- UP to (3,8) - moves me up, toward the top wall, potentially cutting off his escape routes\n- DOWN to (3,6) - moves me down, away from immediate danger\n- RIGHT to (4,7) - moves me toward the right wall, potentially boxing him in\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (2,3) that I could potentially reach, but more importantly - I need to POSITION MYSELF to trap him!\n\nIf I go UP to (3,8), I'm moving toward the top wall, which could be dangerous but also gives me control of that area. This prevents him from surrounding me from above.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Control the center area, force the enemy into a corner against the walls, and trap him. Don't let him escape to the open areas! Keep your body flexible and don't get boxed in.\n\nUP",
