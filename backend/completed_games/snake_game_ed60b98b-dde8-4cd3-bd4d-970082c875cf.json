So I'm just a head right now.\n- Apples: at (0,0), (9,8), (0,1), (8,6), (0,2)\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (0,9), no body.\n\nBoard visualization (y from 9 top to 0 bottom):\nRow 9: 0 . . . . . . . . . \nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . A  # A at (9,8)\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 6: . . . . . . . .

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (2,1)\n- DOWN: to (2,-1) -> but y=-1 is below 0, so wall. Death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: to (1,0)\n- RIGHT: to (3,0)\n\nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are valid? But DOWN would be invalid because it goes off the board.\n\nNow, what about apples? There are apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) on the left column, and also at (8,6) and (9,8).\n\nThe closest apple is at (0,0) and (0,1), both at distance 2 from me (in different directions). (0,0) is at left-bottom, (0,1) is one above it.\n\nSince I have no body, I can safely move to adjacent cells without self-collision. The only danger is the enemy snake or walls.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,9), far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n1. UP: (2,1) \n   - This is not an apple. (Apples are at (0,2), (0,1), etc. (2,1) is empty? From board: row 1 has A at (0,1) and then dots. So (2,1) should be empty. Yes, board shows row1: A . . . so (1,1) is dot, (2,1) is dot? Wait, row1: index 0 is A, index 1 is dot, index 2 is dot? Coordinates: row 1, columns: 0,1,2,... so at (0,1) is A, (1,1) is ., (2,1) is . . So moving to (2,1) is safe and empty.\n\n   After moving to (2,1), I'm closer to the apple at (0,2) or (0,1). (0,1) is at (0,1) and (2,1) is two steps away.\n\n2. LEFT: to (1,0)\n   - (1,0) is empty? Row 0: (0,0) is A, (1,0) is . (since row0: A . 1 ... so index 0: A, index 1: ., index 2:1). So (1,0) is empty and safe. Then next step I could go to (0,0) to eat apple? But (0,0) has an apple. Also, (0,1) is above.\n\n3. LEFT to (1,0): then from there, I could go LEFT again to (0,0) to eat apple, or UP to (1,1) to approach (0,1) or (0,2).\n\n4. RIGHT: to (3,0)\n   - (3,0) is empty? Row 0: ... after (2,0) is 1, then (3,0) should be empty. Yes, board shows for row0: 0,1,2,3,... columns: A at 0, dot at 1, 1 (me) at 2, then dot at 3? So (3,0) is empty. But moving right takes me away from the apples on the left.\n\nThe apples on the left are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). There are also apples at (8,6) and (9,8), but those are far.\n\nEating an apple makes me grow. Since I have no body, after eating one apple, I will have a body of length 1 (so head and one tail segment).\n\nI should aim for the closest apple. The apple at (0,0) is at distance: Manhattan from (2,0) to (0,0) is 2 (left twice). Similarly, (0,1) is at distance |2-0| + |0-1| = 2+1=3, or if I go left then up, it's 2 moves. (0,2) is |2-0| + |0-2| = 2+2=4.\n\nBut (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), so if I go left to (1,0), then next move I can go to (0,0) and eat that apple.\n\nIf I go up to (2,1), then from there I can go left to (1,1) or (0,1) to eat the apple at (0,1)? (0,1) is at row1, column0. From (2,1) to (0,1): left twice. But I might get the apple at (0,2) from above.\n\nBut (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), going left to (1,1) then to (0,1) or up to (2,2) then left to (1,2) to (0,2). But (0,2) has an apple.\n\nConsidering efficiency, going left to (1,0) and then to (0,0) gets me an apple in two moves. If I go up to (2,1), then I need at least two more moves to get to (0,1) or three to (0,2), etc.\n\nAlso, enemy snake is at (0,9). They might also be going for apples. The apple at (9,8) is near the enemy, but enemy is at (0,9), which is top left, and (9,8) is bottom right? Wait no: row8 is one below top, column9. So (9,8) is top right? Coordinates: x=9, y=8. Since y=9 is top row, y=8 is row index 8.\n\nFrom enemy at (0,9) to (9,8): that's a long way. Similarly, to (8,6) at x=8,y=6.\n\nProbably the enemy will go for (9,8) or (8,6) since they are closer to it? (0,9) to (9,8): |0-9| + |9-8| =9+1=10. To (8,6): |0-8| + |9-6| =8+3=11. But also there are apples at (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) which are closer to enemy? (0,9) to (0,0): |0-0| + |9-0| =9, same as to (9,8). But (0,1) and (0,2) are closer: (0,1) is |0-0| + |9-1| =8 steps down? y decreases down, so from (0,9) to (0,1): y from 9 to 1, difference 8, so 8 steps down. Similarly to (0,2) is 7 steps down.\n\nBut enemy might go down to get those apples. However, there are three apples on the left column, so I should grab one quickly before enemy does.\n\nSince I'm at (2,0), I can get to (0,0) in two moves: LEFT then LEFT again. Or I could go directly to (0,0) but I can only move one step.\n\nFirst move: if I go LEFT to (1,0), then next move I can go LEFT to (0,0) and eat the apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,1), then from there I could go LEFT to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) to eat that apple, but that takes three moves to eat the apple at (0,1)? First move to (2,1), second to (1,1), third to (0,1). Whereas if I go left to (1,0), then left to (0,0) for apple in two moves.\n\nI should prioritize getting an apple as soon as possible to grow and have a body.\n\nAlso, after eating, I grow, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for now, since the board is mostly empty, it's safe.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? To (3,0). Then I'm moving away from the apples. The next closest apple might be at (8,6) or (9,8), but that's far. Not efficient.\n\nSo RIGHT seems bad.\n\nTherefore, I should go LEFT to (1,0).\n\nBut let's confirm: (1,0) is empty, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (0,9), not near.\n\nAlso, no immediate danger.\n\nAfter I eat the apple at (0,0), I will have a body segment at (1,0) or something? When I eat an apple, I grow. Since I have no body now, after moving to the apple, my head becomes the new position, and the previous head becomes the body? Standard snake growth: when you eat, you grow by one, so the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n\nBut in this case, since I start with only head, when I eat an apple, I will have a body segment at my previous position.\n\nFor example: if I move from (2,0) to (1,0) and (1,0) is not apple, then I just move, head to (1,0), no body. Then next move to (0,0), which is apple: so I move to (0,0), and grow, so now head at (0,0), and body at (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to an apple on first move? But from (2,0), I can't reach an apple in one move. The apples are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (8,6), (9,8). None adjacent to (2,0). Adjacent cells: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1 invalid).\n\nNone of these have apple? (1,0) is empty, (3,0) empty, (2,1) empty. So I have to move to an empty cell first.\n\nSo best to go LEFT to (1,0) to set up for eating (0,0) next.\n\nBut what if I go UP to (2,1)? Then I can go to (2,2) or something. But the apple at (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) then to (0,1) to eat apple at (0,1), or to (0,2) via (1,2) or (2,2) then left.\n\nBut it takes more moves.\n\nFor example:\n- Move 1: UP to (2,1) [empty]\n- Move 2: LEFT to (1,1) [empty]\n- Move 3: LEFT to (0,1) [apple]\n\nThat's three moves to eat the apple at (0,1). Whereas via left path: move 1: LEFT to (1,0) [empty], move 2: LEFT to (0,0) [apple]. So I eat in two moves.\n\nSimilarly, for (0,2): from (2,1), I could go UP to (2,2) [empty? row2 has A at (0,2), so (1,2) and (2,2) should be empty? Then from (2,2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to eat. That would be move to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (0,2) \u2014 four moves? Not good.\n\nSo going left towards (0,0) is better.\n\nThere is also an apple at (0,2), but I can get that later.\n\nMoreover, after eating (0,0), I can then go up to (0,1) to eat that apple if it's still there, and so on.\n\nBut the enemy might also go for these apples. Enemy is at (0,9), so to reach (0,0), it takes at least 9 moves down (y from 9 to 0). Similarly to (0,1) 8 moves, etc. I can get to (0,0) in two moves, so I will get it first.\n\nThen I can plan to get (0,1) or (0,2) next.\n\nBut for now, first move: LEFT to (1,0).\n\nI should also consider if there is any risk. For example, moving left to (1,0) is safe.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might start moving down. But it's far.\n\nAlso, apples don't disappear until eaten, I assume.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nBut let me double-check the board: row0: A at (0,0), dot at (1,0), me at (2,0). Yes.\n\nMoving down is invalid, as (2,-1) is wall.\n\nUP and RIGHT are valid but not as direct to an apple.\n\nSo I should go LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: after moving to (1,0), then go LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple, unless something changes.\n\nAlso, note that there are multiple apples, so I can chain them.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (2,0) with no body, so I can move freely. The closest apples are at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) on the left. Moving LEFT to (1,0) positions me to reach (0,0) in the next move to eat the apple, which is efficient. Other moves like UP or RIGHT delay apple acquisition. There is no immediate threat from the enemy snake at (0,9), as it is far away. Therefore, the best move is LEFT to approach the apple quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move to (1,0), then next turn I should move LEFT to (0,0) to eat the apple, unless the board state changes.\n\nMove: LEFT",

So I'm just a head right now.\n- Apples: at (0,0), (9,8), (0,1), (8,6), (0,2)\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (0,9), no body.\n\nBoard visualization (y from 9 top to 0 bottom):\nRow 9: 0 . . . . . . . . . \nRow 8: . . . . . . . . .

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (2,1)\n- DOWN: to (2,-1) -> but y=-1 is below 0, so wall. Death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: to (1,0)\n- RIGHT: to (3,0)\n\nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are valid? But DOWN would be invalid because it goes off the board.\n\nNow, what about apples? There are apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) on the left column, and also at (8,6) and (9,8).\n\nThe closest apple is at (0,0) and (0,1), both at distance 2 from me (in different directions). (0,0) is at left-bottom, (0,1) is one above it.\n\nSince I have no body, I can safely move to adjacent cells without self-collision. The only danger is the enemy snake or walls.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,9), far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n1. UP: (2,1) \n   - This is not an apple. (Apples are at (0,2), (0,1), etc. (2,1) is empty? From board: row 1 has A at (0,1) and then dots. So (2,1) should be empty. Yes, board shows row1: A . . . so (1,1) is dot, (2,1) is dot? Wait, row1: index 0 is A, index 1 is dot, index 2 is dot? Coordinates: row 1, columns: 0,1,2,... so at (0,1) is A, (1,1) is ., (2,1) is . . So moving to (2,1) is safe and empty.\n\n   After moving to (2,1), I'm closer to the apple at (0,2) or (0,1). (0,1) is at (0,1) and (2,1) is two steps away.\n\n2. LEFT: to (1,0)\n   - (1,0) is empty? Row 0: (0,0) is A, (1,0) is . (since row0: A . 1 ... so index 0: A, index 1: ., index 2:1). So (1,0) is empty and safe. Then next step I could go to (0,0) to eat apple? But (0,0) has an apple. Also, (0,1) is above.\n\n3. LEFT to (1,0): then from there, I could go LEFT again to (0,0) to eat apple, or UP to (1,1) to approach (0,1) or (0,2).\n\n4. RIGHT: to (3,0)\n   - (3,0) is empty? Row 0: ... after (2,0) is 1, then (3,0) should be empty. Yes, board shows for row0: 0,1,2,3,... columns: A at 0, dot at 1, 1 (me) at 2, then dot at 3? So (3,0) is empty. But moving right takes me away from the apples on the left.\n\nThe apples on the left are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). There are also apples at (8,6) and (9,8), but those are far.\n\nEating an apple makes me grow. Since I have no body, after eating one apple, I will have a body of length 1 (so head and one tail segment).\n\nI should aim for the closest apple. The apple at (0,0) is at distance: Manhattan from (2,0) to (0,0) is 2 (left twice). Similarly, (0,1) is at distance |2-0| + |0-1| = 2+1=3, or if I go left then up, it's 2 moves. (0,2) is |2-0| + |0-2| = 2+2=4.\n\nBut (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), so if I go left to (1,0), then next move I can go to (0,0) and eat that apple.\n\nIf I go up to (2,1), then from there I can go left to (1,1) or (0,1) to eat the apple at (0,1)? (0,1) is at row1, column0. From (2,1) to (0,1): left twice. But I might get the apple at (0,2) from above.\n\nBut (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), going left to (1,1) then to (0,1) or up to (2,2) then left to (1,2) to (0,2). But (0,2) has an apple.\n\nConsidering efficiency, going left to (1,0) and then to (0,0) gets me an apple in two moves. If I go up to (2,1), then I need at least two more moves to get to (0,1) or three to (0,2), etc.\n\nAlso, enemy snake is at (0,9). They might also be going for apples. The apple at (9,8) is near the enemy, but enemy is at (0,9), which is top left, and (9,8) is bottom right? Wait no: row8 is one below top, column9. So (9,8) is top right? Coordinates: x=9, y=8. Since y=9 is top row, y=8 is row index 8.\n\nFrom enemy at (0,9) to (9,8): that's a long way. Similarly, to (8,6) at x=8,y=6.\n\nProbably the enemy will go for (9,8) or (8,6) since they are closer to it? (0,9) to (9,8): |0-9| + |9-8| =9+1=10. To (8,6): |0-8| + |9-6| =8+3=11. But also there are apples at (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) which are closer to enemy? (0,9) to (0,0): |0-0| + |9-0| =9, same as to (9,8). But (0,1) and (0,2) are closer: (0,1) is |0-0| + |9-1| =8 steps down? y decreases down, so from (0,9) to (0,1): y from 9 to 1, difference 8, so 8 steps down. Similarly to (0,2) is 7 steps down.\n\nBut enemy might go down to get those apples. However, there are three apples on the left column, so I should grab one quickly before enemy does.\n\nSince I'm at (2,0), I can get to (0,0) in two moves: LEFT then LEFT again. Or I could go directly to (0,0) but I can only move one step.\n\nFirst move: if I go LEFT to (1,0), then next move I can go LEFT to (0,0) and eat the apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,1), then from there I could go LEFT to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) to eat that apple, but that takes three moves to eat the apple at (0,1)? First move to (2,1), second to (1,1), third to (0,1). Whereas if I go left to (1,0), then left to (0,0) for apple in two moves.\n\nI should prioritize getting an apple as soon as possible to grow and have a body.\n\nAlso, after eating, I grow, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for now, since the board is mostly empty, it's safe.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? To (3,0). Then I'm moving away from the apples. The next closest apple might be at (8,6) or (9,8), but that's far. Not efficient.\n\nSo RIGHT seems bad.\n\nTherefore, I should go LEFT to (1,0).\n\nBut let's confirm: (1,0) is empty, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (0,9), not near.\n\nAlso, no immediate danger.\n\nAfter I eat the apple at (0,0), I will have a body segment at (1,0) or something? When I eat an apple, I grow. Since I have no body now, after moving to the apple, my head becomes the new position, and the previous head becomes the body? Standard snake growth: when you eat, you grow by one, so the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n\nBut in this case, since I start with only head, when I eat an apple, I will have a body segment at my previous position.\n\nFor example: if I move from (2,0) to (1,0) and (1,0) is not apple, then I just move, head to (1,0), no body. Then next move to (0,0), which is apple: so I move to (0,0), and grow, so now head at (0,0), and body at (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to an apple on first move? But from (2,0), I can't reach an apple in one move. The apples are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (8,6), (9,8). None adjacent to (2,0). Adjacent cells: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1 invalid).\n\nNone of these have apple? (1,0) is empty, (3,0) empty, (2,1) empty. So I have to move to an empty cell first.\n\nSo best to go LEFT to (1,0) to set up for eating (0,0) next.\n\nBut what if I go UP to (2,1)? Then I can go to (2,2) or something. But the apple at (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) then to (0,1) to eat apple at (0,1), or to (0,2) via (1,2) or (2,2) then left.\n\nBut it takes more moves.\n\nFor example:\n- Move 1: UP to (2,1) [empty]\n- Move 2: LEFT to (1,1) [empty]\n- Move 3: LEFT to (0,1) [apple]\n\nThat's three moves to eat the apple at (0,1). Whereas via left path: move 1: LEFT to (1,0) [empty], move 2: LEFT to (0,0) [apple]. So I eat in two moves.\n\nSimilarly, for (0,2): from (2,1), I could go UP to (2,2) [empty? row2 has A at (0,2), so (1,2) and (2,2) should be empty? Then from (2,2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to eat. That would be move to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (0,2) \u2014 four moves? Not good.\n\nSo going left towards (0,0) is better.\n\nThere is also an apple at (0,2), but I can get that later.\n\nMoreover, after eating (0,0), I can then go up to (0,1) to eat that apple if it's still there, and so on.\n\nBut the enemy might also go for these apples. Enemy is at (0,9), so to reach (0,0), it takes at least 9 moves down (y from 9 to 0). Similarly to (0,1) 8 moves, etc. I can get to (0,0) in two moves, so I will get it first.\n\nThen I can plan to get (0,1) or (0,2) next.\n\nBut for now, first move: LEFT to (1,0).\n\nI should also consider if there is any risk. For example, moving left to (1,0) is safe.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might start moving down. But it's far.\n\nAlso, apples don't disappear until eaten, I assume.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nBut let me double-check the board: row0: A at (0,0), dot at (1,0), me at (2,0). Yes.\n\nMoving down is invalid, as (2,-1) is wall.\n\nUP and RIGHT are valid but not as direct to an apple.\n\nSo I should go LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: after moving to (1,0), then go LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple, unless something changes.\n\nAlso, note that there are multiple apples, so I can chain them.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (2,0) with no body, so I can move freely. The closest apples are at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) on the left. Moving LEFT to (1,0) positions me to reach (0,0) in the next move to eat the apple, which is efficient. Other moves like UP or RIGHT delay apple acquisition. There is no immediate threat from the enemy snake at (0,9), as it is far away. Therefore, the best move is LEFT to approach the apple quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move to (1,0), then next turn I should move LEFT to (0,0) to eat the apple, unless the board state changes.\n\nMove: LEFT",

This is a change from last turn where I was at (2,0); I must have moved LEFT as planned.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (0,8) with no body. Previously it was at (0,9), so it moved DOWN to (0,8).\n- Board visualization:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 0 . . . . . . . . A   # A at (9,8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . .

But note: I am now at (1,0), adjacent to the apple at (0,0).\n\n**Possible moves for me:**\n- UP: to (1,1) - empty, not an apple.\n- DOWN: to (1,-1) - invalid, below board (y=-1).\n- LEFT: to (0,0) - this is an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- RIGHT: to (2,0) - empty (since I moved from there).\n\nDOWN is invalid. So I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Moving LEFT to (0,0) allows me to eat the apple immediately. This would:\n  - Add 1 point.\n  - Grow my snake: my body would become [(1,0)] and head at (0,0).\n  - Be safe: no collision risk (enemy is far at (0,8)).\n- Moving UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0) delays eating the apple and wastes a turn. It also risks the enemy or other factors later.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**\n- Enemy snake was at (0,9) and is now at (0,8). It likely moved DOWN to approach apples at (0,2), (0,1), or (0,0). But it's still 8 units away in y-direction (from y=8 to y=0). I can reach (0,0) this turn, so I'll get the apple before it can.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- After eating (0,0), I can target (0,1) next (if still available) by moving UP to (0,1) next turn. This would chain apples efficiently.\n- Apples at (0,2), (8,6), (9,8) are backup options.\n- Since the enemy is moving down, it might conflict with me for the left-column apples soon. Eating (0,0) and (0,1) quickly secures points and helps me grow, making me more resilient.\n- There are no immediate threats; all moves are safe this turn except DOWN (invalid). But LEFT gives the most benefit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- LEFT is the best move: it secures an apple this turn.\n- UP or RIGHT have no advantage.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** If I move LEFT to (0,0) and eat the apple, next turn I should move UP to (0,1) to eat that apple (if it's still there), growing further.\n\n</think>\n\nI am at (1,0) and the apple at (0,0) is directly to my left. Moving LEFT allows me to eat this apple immediately, gaining a point and growing. This is the most efficient move and positions me to chain to the next apple at (0,1). Enemy snake is at (0,8) and not an immediate threat. Other moves are suboptimal as they delay apple acquisition.\n\nMove: LEFT",

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (2,1)\n- DOWN: to (2,-1) -> but y=-1 is below 0, so wall. Death. Not an option.\n- LEFT: to (1,0)\n- RIGHT: to (3,0)\n\nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are valid? But DOWN would be invalid because it goes off the board.\n\nNow, what about apples? There are apples at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) on the left column, and also at (8,6) and (9,8).\n\nThe closest apple is at (0,0) and (0,1), both at distance 2 from me (in different directions). (0,0) is at left-bottom, (0,1) is one above it.\n\nSince I have no body, I can safely move to adjacent cells without self-collision. The only danger is the enemy snake or walls.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,9), far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n1. UP: (2,1) \n   - This is not an apple. (Apples are at (0,2), (0,1), etc. (2,1) is empty? From board: row 1 has A at (0,1) and then dots. So (2,1) should be empty. Yes, board shows row1: A . . . so (1,1) is dot, (2,1) is dot? Wait, row1: index 0 is A, index 1 is dot, index 2 is dot? Coordinates: row 1, columns: 0,1,2,... so at (0,1) is A, (1,1) is ., (2,1) is . . So moving to (2,1) is safe and empty.\n\n   After moving to (2,1), I'm closer to the apple at (0,2) or (0,1). (0,1) is at (0,1) and (2,1) is two steps away.\n\n2. LEFT: to (1,0)\n   - (1,0) is empty? Row 0: (0,0) is A, (1,0) is . (since row0: A . 1 ... so index 0: A, index 1: ., index 2:1). So (1,0) is empty and safe. Then next step I could go to (0,0) to eat apple? But (0,0) has an apple. Also, (0,1) is above.\n\n3. LEFT to (1,0): then from there, I could go LEFT again to (0,0) to eat apple, or UP to (1,1) to approach (0,1) or (0,2).\n\n4. RIGHT: to (3,0)\n   - (3,0) is empty? Row 0: ... after (2,0) is 1, then (3,0) should be empty. Yes, board shows for row0: 0,1,2,3,... columns: A at 0, dot at 1, 1 (me) at 2, then dot at 3? So (3,0) is empty. But moving right takes me away from the apples on the left.\n\nThe apples on the left are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). There are also apples at (8,6) and (9,8), but those are far.\n\nEating an apple makes me grow. Since I have no body, after eating one apple, I will have a body of length 1 (so head and one tail segment).\n\nI should aim for the closest apple. The apple at (0,0) is at distance: Manhattan from (2,0) to (0,0) is 2 (left twice). Similarly, (0,1) is at distance |2-0| + |0-1| = 2+1=3, or if I go left then up, it's 2 moves. (0,2) is |2-0| + |0-2| = 2+2=4.\n\nBut (0,0) is adjacent to (1,0), so if I go left to (1,0), then next move I can go to (0,0) and eat that apple.\n\nIf I go up to (2,1), then from there I can go left to (1,1) or (0,1) to eat the apple at (0,1)? (0,1) is at row1, column0. From (2,1) to (0,1): left twice. But I might get the apple at (0,2) from above.\n\nBut (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), going left to (1,1) then to (0,1) or up to (2,2) then left to (1,2) to (0,2). But (0,2) has an apple.\n\nConsidering efficiency, going left to (1,0) and then to (0,0) gets me an apple in two moves. If I go up to (2,1), then I need at least two more moves to get to (0,1) or three to (0,2), etc.\n\nAlso, enemy snake is at (0,9). They might also be going for apples. The apple at (9,8) is near the enemy, but enemy is at (0,9), which is top left, and (9,8) is bottom right? Wait no: row8 is one below top, column9. So (9,8) is top right? Coordinates: x=9, y=8. Since y=9 is top row, y=8 is row index 8.\n\nFrom enemy at (0,9) to (9,8): that's a long way. Similarly, to (8,6) at x=8,y=6.\n\nProbably the enemy will go for (9,8) or (8,6) since they are closer to it? (0,9) to (9,8): |0-9| + |9-8| =9+1=10. To (8,6): |0-8| + |9-6| =8+3=11. But also there are apples at (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) which are closer to enemy? (0,9) to (0,0): |0-0| + |9-0| =9, same as to (9,8). But (0,1) and (0,2) are closer: (0,1) is |0-0| + |9-1| =8 steps down? y decreases down, so from (0,9) to (0,1): y from 9 to 1, difference 8, so 8 steps down. Similarly to (0,2) is 7 steps down.\n\nBut enemy might go down to get those apples. However, there are three apples on the left column, so I should grab one quickly before enemy does.\n\nSince I'm at (2,0), I can get to (0,0) in two moves: LEFT then LEFT again. Or I could go directly to (0,0) but I can only move one step.\n\nFirst move: if I go LEFT to (1,0), then next move I can go LEFT to (0,0) and eat the apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,1), then from there I could go LEFT to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) to eat that apple, but that takes three moves to eat the apple at (0,1)? First move to (2,1), second to (1,1), third to (0,1). Whereas if I go left to (1,0), then left to (0,0) for apple in two moves.\n\nI should prioritize getting an apple as soon as possible to grow and have a body.\n\nAlso, after eating, I grow, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for now, since the board is mostly empty, it's safe.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT? To (3,0). Then I'm moving away from the apples. The next closest apple might be at (8,6) or (9,8), but that's far. Not efficient.\n\nSo RIGHT seems bad.\n\nTherefore, I should go LEFT to (1,0).\n\nBut let's confirm: (1,0) is empty, no snake there.\n\nEnemy is at (0,9), not near.\n\nAlso, no immediate danger.\n\nAfter I eat the apple at (0,0), I will have a body segment at (1,0) or something? When I eat an apple, I grow. Since I have no body now, after moving to the apple, my head becomes the new position, and the previous head becomes the body? Standard snake growth: when you eat, you grow by one, so the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n\nBut in this case, since I start with only head, when I eat an apple, I will have a body segment at my previous position.\n\nFor example: if I move from (2,0) to (1,0) and (1,0) is not apple, then I just move, head to (1,0), no body. Then next move to (0,0), which is apple: so I move to (0,0), and grow, so now head at (0,0), and body at (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to an apple on first move? But from (2,0), I can't reach an apple in one move. The apples are at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (8,6), (9,8). None adjacent to (2,0). Adjacent cells: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1 invalid).\n\nNone of these have apple? (1,0) is empty, (3,0) empty, (2,1) empty. So I have to move to an empty cell first.\n\nSo best to go LEFT to (1,0) to set up for eating (0,0) next.\n\nBut what if I go UP to (2,1)? Then I can go to (2,2) or something. But the apple at (0,2) is at row2, column0. From (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) then to (0,1) to eat apple at (0,1), or to (0,2) via (1,2) or (2,2) then left.\n\nBut it takes more moves.\n\nFor example:\n- Move 1: UP to (2,1) [empty]\n- Move 2: LEFT to (1,1) [empty]\n- Move 3: LEFT to (0,1) [apple]\n\nThat's three moves to eat the apple at (0,1). Whereas via left path: move 1: LEFT to (1,0) [empty], move 2: LEFT to (0,0) [apple]. So I eat in two moves.\n\nSimilarly, for (0,2): from (2,1), I could go UP to (2,2) [empty? row2 has A at (0,2), so (1,2) and (2,2) should be empty? Then from (2,2) to (1,2) to (0,2) to eat. That would be move to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (0,2) \u2014 four moves? Not good.\n\nSo going left towards (0,0) is better.\n\nThere is also an apple at (0,2), but I can get that later.\n\nMoreover, after eating (0,0), I can then go up to (0,1) to eat that apple if it's still there, and so on.\n\nBut the enemy might also go for these apples. Enemy is at (0,9), so to reach (0,0), it takes at least 9 moves down (y from 9 to 0). Similarly to (0,1) 8 moves, etc. I can get to (0,0) in two moves, so I will get it first.\n\nThen I can plan to get (0,1) or (0,2) next.\n\nBut for now, first move: LEFT to (1,0).\n\nI should also consider if there is any risk. For example, moving left to (1,0) is safe.\n\nWhat about the enemy? It might start moving down. But it's far.\n\nAlso, apples don't disappear until eaten, I assume.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nBut let me double-check the board: row0: A at (0,0), dot at (1,0), me at (2,0). Yes.\n\nMoving down is invalid, as (2,-1) is wall.\n\nUP and RIGHT are valid but not as direct to an apple.\n\nSo I should go LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: after moving to (1,0), then go LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple, unless something changes.\n\nAlso, note that there are multiple apples, so I can chain them.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at (2,0) with no body, so I can move freely. The closest apples are at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) on the left. Moving LEFT to (1,0) positions me to reach (0,0) in the next move to eat the apple, which is efficient.

Therefore, the best move is LEFT to approach the apple quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move to (1,0), then next turn I should move LEFT to (0,0) to eat the apple, unless the board state changes.\n\nMove: LEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> I must end with the chosen direction.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current board state based on the provided information.\n\n**Current Board State:**\n- Board size: 10x10 (coordinates (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right)\n- Apples: (0,0), (9,8), (0,1), (8,6), (0,2) - Note that (0,2) is at row 2, column 0.\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (1,0) with no body. This is a change from last turn where I was at (2,0); I must have moved LEFT as planned.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (0,8) with no body. Previously it was at (0,9), so it moved DOWN to (0,8).\n- Board visualization:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 0 . . . . . . . . A   # A at (9,8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .   # A at (8,6)\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,2)\n 1 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,1)\n 0 A 1 . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,0) and my head at (1,0)\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nKey changes since last turn:\n- I moved LEFT from (2,0) to (1,0).\n- Enemy snake moved DOWN from (0,9) to (0,8).\n- Apples remain the same: (0,0), (9,8), (0,1), (8,6), (0,2). But note: I am now at (1,0), adjacent to the apple at (0,0).\n\n**Possible moves for me:**\n- UP: to (1,1) - empty, not an apple.\n- DOWN: to (1,-1) - invalid, below board (y=-1).\n- LEFT: to (0,0) - this is an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- RIGHT: to (2,0) - empty (since I moved from there).\n\nDOWN is invalid. So I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Moving LEFT to (0,0) allows me to eat the apple immediately. This would:\n  - Add 1 point.\n  - Grow my snake: my body would become [(1,0)] and head at (0,0).\n  - Be safe: no collision risk (enemy is far at (0,8)).\n- Moving UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0) delays eating the apple and wastes a turn. It also risks the enemy or other factors later.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**\n- Enemy snake was at (0,9) and is now at (0,8). It likely moved DOWN to approach apples at (0,2), (0,1), or (0,0). But it's still 8 units away in y-direction (from y=8 to y=0). I can reach (0,0) this turn, so I'll get the apple before it can.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- After eating (0,0), I can target (0,1) next (if still available) by moving UP to (0,1) next turn. This would chain apples efficiently.\n- Apples at (0,2), (8,6), (9,8) are backup options.\n- Since the enemy is moving down, it might conflict with me for the left-column apples soon. Eating (0,0) and (0,1) quickly secures points and helps me grow, making me more resilient.\n- There are no immediate threats; all moves are safe this turn except DOWN (invalid). But LEFT gives the most benefit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- LEFT is the best move: it secures an apple this turn.\n- UP or RIGHT have no advantage.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** If I move LEFT to (0,0) and eat the apple, next turn I should move UP to (0,1) to eat that apple (if it's still there), growing further.\n\n</think>\n\nI am at (1,0) and the apple at (0,0) is directly to my left. Moving LEFT allows me to eat this apple immediately, gaining a point and growing. This is the most efficient move and positions me to chain to the next apple at (0,1). Enemy snake is at (0,8) and not an immediate threat. Other moves are suboptimal as they delay apple acquisition.\n\nMove: LEFT",
