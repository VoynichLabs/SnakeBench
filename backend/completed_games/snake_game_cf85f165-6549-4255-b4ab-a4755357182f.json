          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state and plan a move step-by-step.\n\n### Current Snake State:\n- **Head**: (2, 1)\n- **Body**: None (just a single segment)\n- **Apples collected**: 0\n\n### Apples Available:\n- (0, 8), (5, 8), (4, 3), (9, 5), (9, 1)\n\n### Enemy Snake:\n- **Head**: (7, 3)\n- **Body**: None\n\n### Board State:\n- The snake is at (2, 1), which is on the bottom row (y=1). The snake is currently at the bottom-left corner of the board, and the only way to move is to the right or up (since left and down would take it off the board).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: From (2, 1), moving up would take the head to (2, 2). This is safe because it does not go off the board, nor does it collide with any body or enemy.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (3, 1), which is off the board (y=0 is the bottom, so y=1 is the second row from the bottom, and moving down from y=1 would go to y=2, which is valid). Wait, no: y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top. So y=1 is the second row from the bottom. Moving down from y=1 would go to y=2, which is valid. However, the snake is currently at (2,1), so moving down would go to (3,1). But the snake is only one segment long, so no immediate collision issues here. But let's check if it's safe:\n   - (3,1) is within bounds.\n   - No snake body or enemy head is at (3,1).\n   - So this is also safe.\n\n   Wait, let's double-check the board state for (3,1): The board shows that (3,1) is empty (no snake or apple there).\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left from (2,1) would go to (1,1), which is within bounds. Check if it's safe: (1,1) is empty, so safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (2,1) would go to (3,1), which is also within bounds and empty.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves:\n- **UP**: (2, 2) is empty and safe.\n- **DOWN**: (3, 1) is empty and safe.\n- **LEFT**: (1, 1) is empty and safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 1) is the same as DOWN, so redundant.\n\n### Evaluating Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is (0,8), which is far away.\n- The next closest is (9,1), which is at (9,1). From (2,1), moving right to (3,1) is not directly towards (9,1), but moving left to (1,1) is also not directly towards it.\n- The apple at (9,1) is directly above the snake's tail if we move right, but since the snake is only one segment, moving right to (3,1) is not directly towards (9,1).\n\nHowever, moving up to (2,2) is not closer to any apple either.\n\n### Evaluating Future Options:\n- Moving up to (2,2) allows the snake to explore the upper part of the board, which might be safer in the long run.\n- Moving left to (1,1) is also a safe option, but it might lead to a dead end if the snake keeps moving left.\n- Moving down to (3,1) is also safe but might not be as flexible for future moves.\n\n### Considering Enemy Movement:\n- The enemy snake is at (7,3). It will also move this turn. If the snake moves up to (2,2), the enemy might move towards the snake's path, but since the snake is only one segment, it's unlikely to cause immediate issues.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- The snake is currently at a corner, which is a strategic position. Moving up will allow the snake to explore the upper part of the board, which might be safer and more flexible for future moves.\n- The snake should avoid moving directly towards the enemy's position, as it might lead to a collision.\n- The snake should prioritize moves that keep options open and avoid getting trapped in a corner.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving up to (2,2) is the safest and most flexible option, allowing the snake to explore the upper part of the board and avoid potential future collisions.\n\nUP",

Its possible moves:\n  - UP (5,2) \u2192 Could collide with our tail if we move LEFT or UP.\n  - DOWN (6,3) \u2192 Could collide with our body if we move RIGHT or DOWN.\n  - LEFT (4,3) \u2192 **Direct collision if we move RIGHT (3,2) or DOWN (3,2).**\n  - RIGHT (6,3) \u2192 Same as DOWN.\n\n**Key Risk:** If we move **RIGHT (3,2)**, the enemy could move LEFT (4,3) and collide with our tail (if we extend right). If we move **DOWN (3,2)**, the enemy could move DOWN (6,3) and collide with our body.\n\n#### **Apple Proximity & Strategy**\n- **Closest Apple:** (4,3) (~3 moves if we snake right).\n- **Next Closest:** (5,8) (~5 moves), (9,1) (~7 moves).\n- **Current Snake Length:** 1 (only head). No tail to block collisions yet.\n\n#### **Best Move: LEFT (1,2)**\n- **Why?**\n  - Avoids immediate enemy threats (no collision risk).\n  - Keeps the snake oriented toward the right (toward (4,3)).\n  - Expands horizontally, reducing future collision risks with the enemy.\n  - If the enemy moves UP/DOWN, we can pivot left or right safely.\n\n#### **Alternative Consideration: UP (2,3)**\n- Also safe, but less optimal for long-term growth. The snake would be more vertically constrained, making it easier for the enemy to corner us.\n\n---\n### **Long-Term Plan (For Future Self)**\n1. **Phase 1 (Turns 1\u201310):** Expand rightward toward (4,3) while avoiding enemy head movements. Prioritize safety over speed.\n2. **Phase 2 (Turns 11\u201330):** If the enemy is far, focus on collecting (4,3) and (5,8). If the enemy is close, pivot left/right to avoid collisions.\n3. **Phase 3 (Turns 31\u2013150):** If the snake grows to 3+ segments, use the tail to block enemy advances. Prioritize apples near the enemy\u2019s path.\n\n---\n**Final Decision:** LEFT",

Their next move is likely to grow toward **(3,2)** or **(4,2)** to block our rightward expansion.\n   - If we move **UP (8,3)**, they may move UP to **(2,3)** or LEFT to **(1,4)**, risking collision with our head or body.\n   - If we move **DOWN (9,4)**, they may move DOWN to **(3,3) \u2192 (3,4)**, but this is less immediate.\n   - If we move **LEFT (9,2)**, they could move DOWN to **(3,3) \u2192 (3,4)**, but this is also risky if they block our path.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity:**\n   - Closest apple: **(9,1)** (distance = 1 left move from current head).\n   - Next closest: **(5,8)** (farther, requires upward movement).\n\n3. **Safe Moves from (9,3):**\n   - **UP (8,3):** Risky if enemy moves UP to (2,3) or LEFT to (1,4).\n   - **DOWN (9,4):** Risky if enemy moves DOWN to (3,4).\n   - **LEFT (9,2):** Safe (no tail to block), moves toward apple (9,1).\n   - **RIGHT (invalid):** Would wrap to (0,3) or hit tail if it existed.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Move: LEFT**\n**Reasoning:**\n- Moving **LEFT (9,2)** is the safest and most direct move toward the closest apple **(9,1)**.\n- It avoids immediate enemy threats by not advancing toward their potential paths.\n- It keeps the snake aligned with the right edge, reducing future collision risk.\n- The enemy cannot block this move effectively since their body is at (3,3), and their head is at (4,3). They cannot easily intercept our leftward movement without risking their own growth.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:**\n- Moving **UP (8,3)** could be risky if the enemy moves UP to (2,3), but it\u2019s not as direct toward the apple.\n- Moving **DOWN (9,4)** is also risky and less optimal for apple proximity.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Turns 15\u201330 (For Future Self):**\n1. **Immediate Priority (Turns 15\u201320):**\n   - Expand **rightward** toward **(9,1)** or **(9,5)** while avoiding enemy aggression.\n   - If the enemy moves aggressively (e.g., toward (8,3)), pivot to **upward** toward **(5,8)** to create space.\n   - Use the tail to block enemy advances if the snake grows to 2+ segments.\n\n2. **Snake Growth (Turns 21\u201325):**\n   - Once the snake reaches 2 segments, extend the tail to block enemy paths (e.g., if enemy threatens (8,3), extend tail to (8,1)).\n   - Prioritize apples that force the enemy into a corner.\n\n3. **Apple Targeting:**\n   - If the closest apple is **(9,1)**, aim for **right + down** moves.\n   - If the enemy blocks, switch to **up + right** (e.g., toward **(5,8)**).\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation:**\n   - Never move into the enemy\u2019s body or their potential paths.\n   - Exploit enemy weaknesses if they\u2019re cornered.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\nLEFT",

Wait, no\u2014the last move was LEFT from (9,3) to (9,2), but the current head is (7,2). This suggests the snake grew during the turn, meaning it ate an apple. But the problem states your snake has 0 apples collected. This discrepancy implies the last move was not LEFT from (9,3) but rather a different path. Let\u2019s clarify:\n\n**Revised Current State:**\nFrom the board state:\n- The snake\u2019s head is at **(7,2)**.\n- The body is empty (no segments listed).\n- Apples collected: 0.\n\nThis implies the snake grew during the turn, but the problem states your snake has 0 apples collected. This is inconsistent. Assuming the snake grew (e.g., from a single segment to two segments), but the problem states no body segments, this suggests the snake is still a single segment. The last move was LEFT from (9,3) to (9,2), but the head is now at (7,2). This is impossible unless the snake grew during the turn, but the problem states no apples collected. This is a contradiction.\n\n**Clarification:**\nGiven the board state, the snake\u2019s head is at (7,2), and the body is empty. This implies the snake grew during the turn, but the problem states your snake has 0 apples collected. This is impossible unless the snake grew due to another reason (e.g., the snake was already a single segment, and the head moved to (7,2) without growing). This is likely a mistake in the problem description. For the sake of this analysis, I will assume the snake is still a single segment at (7,2), and the last move was LEFT from (9,3) to (9,2), but the head is now at (7,2). This is impossible, so I will assume the snake is at (9,2) and the head is at (7,2) is a typo. The snake is at (9,2).\n\n**Revised Current State:**\n- Head: **(9,2)** (from last move LEFT from (9,3)).\n- Body: None.\n- Apples collected: 0.\n\n**Enemy State:**\n- Snake #0: Head at (4,3), body at (3,3).

Moving UP would take you to (7, -1), which is off the board (invalid).\n\nWait, this seems off. The closest apple is (9, 1), which is far from (7, 0). The next closest is (9, 5), which is also far. The next closest is (9, 1), which is the same as above. The other apples are even farther away.\n\nWait, let's clarify the apple positions:\n- (0, 8): far left, top row.\n- (5, 8): middle left, top row.\n- (9, 5): far right, middle row.\n- (9, 1): far right, bottom row.\n- (3, 9): middle left, top row.\n\nThe closest apple to your current position (7, 0) is (9, 1), which is 2 cells right and 1 cell up. But moving DOWN from (7, 0) would go to (7, 1), which is not near (9, 1). So moving DOWN is not directly toward an apple.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\nSnake #0 is at (3, 5) and (3, 4). It is currently moving vertically (y-coordinate). If it moves DOWN, it would go to (3, 6) and (3, 5). If it moves UP, it would go to (3, 4) and (3, 3). If it moves LEFT, it would go to (2, 5) and (2, 4). If it moves RIGHT, it would go to (4, 5) and (4, 4).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT, it would block the path to (9, 1) or (9, 5) if you try to expand rightward. So it's important to avoid moving into its path.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Turns 17\u201330:\n1. **Immediate Goal**: Since your snake is just a head, you need to grow to at least 2 segments to start expanding. The closest apple is (9, 1), but moving toward it would require moving RIGHT twice (to (8, 0) and then (9, 0)), but you are at (7, 0). Moving RIGHT from (7, 0) would go to (8, 0). Then next turn, you could move RIGHT to (9, 0), and if you eat the apple at (9, 1), you would grow. But the apple is at (9, 1), so you would need to move to (9, 0) and then (9, 1) to eat it, but you can only move one cell per turn.\n\nWait, no: if you move RIGHT to (8, 0), then next turn you can move RIGHT to (9, 0), and then you would be at (9, 0), and the apple is at (9, 1). You can't eat it in one move. So you need to move to (9, 1) directly, which would require moving RIGHT twice in two turns, but you can't eat the apple in the same turn.\n\nWait, let's clarify: if you move RIGHT to (8, 0), then next turn you can move RIGHT to (9, 0), and then you can move UP to (9, 1) to eat the apple. But you can only move one cell per turn, so you can't eat the apple in the same turn as moving to (9, 0).\n\nSo, the best immediate plan is to grow to 2 segments by moving RIGHT to (8, 0), then RIGHT to (9, 0), and then UP to (9, 1) to eat the apple. But this takes 3 turns.\n\nAlternatively, you could move DOWN to (7, 1), then DOWN to (7, 2), etc., but this would not help you grow toward the apple.\n\nGiven that, the best immediate move is to grow toward the apple by moving RIGHT to (8, 0), which is safe and expands your body.\n\n### Enemy Threat:\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT, it would block your path to the right. So you should avoid moving LEFT if Snake #0 is likely to move LEFT.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving RIGHT from (7, 0) to (8, 0) is safe, expands your body, and keeps you on the bottom row, which is a good position to expand rightward.\n\n**UP, RIGHT**",
