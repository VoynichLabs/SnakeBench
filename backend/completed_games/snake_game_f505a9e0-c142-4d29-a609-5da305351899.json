Moving LEFT from (4,8) would go to (3,9), which is safe. Moving RIGHT would go to (5,8), also safe. Moving UP or DOWN would go to (4,7) or (4,9). Snake #0 is at (8,9), so moving to (4,9) is safe. Thus, all directions are safe from enemy collision.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy:\n- **Nearest apple**: (1,7) is the closest apple, at a Manhattan distance of |4-1| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- **Other apples**: (8,1), (3,0), (8,5) are farther away (distance 10, 7, 3 respectively).\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n- **UP**: Move to (4,7). This is a safe move and moves you closer to the nearest apple (1,7). The snake body is empty, so no future constraints.\n- **DOWN**: Move to (4,9). This is safe but moves you away from the nearest apple. This is less optimal.\n- **LEFT**: Move to (3,8). This is safe but does not move you closer to the nearest apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Move to (5,8). This is safe but also does not move you closer to the nearest apple.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Short-term**: Prioritize moving toward the nearest apple (1,7) to maximize immediate growth.\n- **Mid-term**: After eating the apple, consider expanding the snake body to block enemy snakes or create a path to other apples.\n- **Long-term**: Monitor enemy movements and plan to avoid collisions with Snake #0, especially if it starts growing.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe move that optimally balances immediate apple collection and safety is **UP**.\n\nUP",

Moving **UP** to **(4, 7)** is safe (no overlap). Moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 8)** is also safe (no overlap). Moving **LEFT** to **(3, 8)** is safe. Moving **DOWN** to **(4, 9)** is safe (Snake #0 is at **(8, 9)**, not directly blocking).\n\n2. **Apple Proximity**:\n   - Nearest apple: **(1, 7)** (Manhattan distance = 4).\n   - Other apples are farther away (e.g., **(8, 1)** is distance 10).\n   - Moving **UP** reduces distance to **(4, 7)** \u2192 closer to **(1, 7)**.\n\n3. **Enemy Strategy**:\n   - Snake #0 is alone and stationary. No immediate threat.\n   - If it grows later, we must avoid its path. For now, **UP** is safest and most efficient.\n\n4. **Follow-Up Moves**:\n   - After eating **(1, 7)**, we\u2019ll have a body segment. Future moves must avoid the new tail.\n   - **UP** keeps flexibility (e.g., can turn left/right later without immediate risk).\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (For Future Self)**\n- **Turn 1-3**: Grow toward **(1, 7)** while avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion.\n- **Turn 4-6**: If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move, expand toward **(8, 1)** or **(3, 0)**.\n- **Turn 7+**: Monitor Snake #0\u2019s growth. If it grows, block its path by extending toward **(8, 5)** or **(0, 0)**.\n- **Avoid**: Getting trapped in a straight line (e.g., moving DOWN repeatedly).\n\n---\n**UP**",

All four adjacent cells are on the board and not occupied by bodies, and none contain an apple right now.\n- The closest apple you can reach soon is at (8,5) along the same x-coordinate. Moving DOWN now keeps you on a straight path toward that apple, preserving future options and minimizing risk of getting trapped.\n- Moving UP would place you on the top edge with no immediate apple and potentially reduce future maneuverability. LEFT or RIGHT would deviate from the direct path to the nearby apple and could complicate navigation.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Take a straight-down approach to (8,5) to eat the apple there as soon as possible, then reassess between remaining apples (0,0), (3,0), (1,7), (8,1), (8,5 already taken). Stay alert for head-on collisions with the enemy at (4,9) and adapt if they head toward your path.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- If safe to continue, follow the vertical line: move DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6), then DOWN to (8,5) to eat the apple. After that, aim toward the next closest apple while keeping options open.\n\nDOWN",
