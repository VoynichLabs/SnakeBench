The (6, 0) apple is directly to my left and at the same y-coordinate\n2. Enemy snake #2 is far away at (6, 7) and doesn't seem to be an immediate threat\n3. Moving LEFT would get me an apple immediately\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- Moving LEFT is safe\n- I won't hit any walls\n- I won't collide with any snake body (since none are shown)\n- I'll directly obtain an apple\n\nSelf-Reminder for Next Turn: After eating this apple, look for the next closest apple and plot a path.\n\nDecision Rationale: Direct path to closest apple with no risks.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

I could go for that one, but I'd have to navigate through the bottom-left corner of the board, which might be risky.\n\nHowever, I also notice that Snake #1 is at position (7, 0), which is close to the apple I'm interested in. If I go for the apple, I might run into Snake #1, which would be bad.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an apple at (8, 3) that's relatively safe to reach. It's a bit of a detour, but it's a more secure option.\n\nMy strategy for next turn: I'll aim to get the apple at (8, 3) to grow and gain a point. This will also give me more flexibility to navigate the board and potentially go for other apples.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
