Move up to (0, 1) to avoid the enemy snake and position the snake to move towards the apple at (1, 0).\n2. Then, move left to (-1, 1) to continue towards the apple.\n\nNext move: UP\n\nAfter this move, the next turn will be to move LEFT.",

            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "<think> This is just a thought process.\n\nFirst, I'm at position (1,2). The apples are at (9,2), (1,0), (6,5), (6,9), and (1,7). My snake ID is 0, and there's an enemy snake #1 at (0,2). The board shows:\n- At row 2 (which is y=2): x=0 has snake #1, x=1 has me (snake 0), and x=9 has an apple.\n- Apples are at (9,2), (1,0) which is directly below me at x=1 y=0, (6,5), (6,9), and (1,7) which is above me at the same x.\n\nSince I start at (1,2) and my body is empty, I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (0,2), which is to my left. I need to decide where to move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- LEFT to (0,2): but that's where snake #1 is, so I would die by collision. Bad move.\n- RIGHT to (2,2): that's empty, according to the board. Row 2, x=2 is shown as '.' meaning empty.\n- UP to (1,3): also empty, row 3 is all empty in this area.\n- DOWN to (1,1): row 1 is empty, and below that at (1,0) is an apple. So moving DOWN twice could get me to the apple at (1,0), but I need to survive the first move.\n\nImmediate apple: The apple at (1,0) is directly below me at (1,2). So from (1,2), moving DOWN to (1,1), then if I can move DOWN again to (1,0), I would eat the apple. But I have to move one step at a time. After moving DOWN to (1,1), I would be at (1,1) and then next turn I could go to (1,0) to eat it.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (9,2) which is to the right, but it's far. And (1,7) is above me. Similarly, (6,5) and (6,9) are elsewhere.\n\nConsidering the enemy: Snake #1 is at (0,2), which is adjacent to my left. If I move LEFT, I die. Also, if snake #1 moves, it might come towards me. But I don't know what the enemy will do. Since this is turn-based, I need to consider possible threats.\n\nIn this initial move, since my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. The wall: x from 0 to 9, y from 0 to 9. So (1,1) is within bounds, no wall.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1,1) seems safe and gets me closer to the apple at (1,0).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,2) is also safe, but doesn't get me directly to an apple immediately. From there, I could go to (2,1) or (2,3), etc., but the apples are not in that direction except for the one at (9,2), which is far.\n\nMoving UP to (1,3) is safe, and then I could head towards (1,7) which is an apple. From (1,3) to (1,7) is 4 moves up.\n\nComparing the two closest apples: (1,0) is 2 moves away (DOWN then DOWN), and (1,7) is 5 moves away (UP 5 times, but I can move diagonally? No, in Snake, you move one square at a time in cardinal directions, not diagonally. So from (1,2) to (1,0) is 2 down, to (1,7) is 5 up.\n\nBut (1,0) is closer. Also, (9,2) is 8 moves right, since I'm at x=1, y=2, to x=9 y=2, that's 8 steps right. (6,5) is 5 right and 3 up, but Manhattan distance is 8, etc.\n\nPrioritizing the closest apple: (1,0) is Manhattan distance |1-1| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2. (1,7) is |1-1| + |7-2| = 5. (9,2) is |9-1| + |2-2| = 8. (6,5) is |6-1| + |5-2| = 5+3=8. (6,9) is |6-1| + |9-2| = 5+7=12. So (1,0) is the closest.\n\nMoreover, moving DOWN to (1,1) gets me halfway there.\n\nBut what about the enemy? Snake #1 is at (0,2). If I move DOWN to (1,1), I'm moving away from it. It might move somewhere, but I can't control that. Since the enemy is also at y=2, if it moves DOWN to (0,1), or RIGHT to (1,2), but (1,2) is where I was, and if I move, it's empty now. If enemy moves RIGHT to (1,2), that would be onto my previous position, which is empty, so it should be fine, but I won't be there.\n\nI think moving DOWN is safe and efficient.\n\nCould I move RIGHT? To (2,2). Then I'm at (2,2), and snake #1 is at (0,2). From (2,2), I could go DOWN, RIGHT, UP, etc. But the apple at (1,0) is still accessible, but I'd have to go LEFT to (1,2) then DOWN, but (1,2) might be occupied by then. Not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (1,3) takes me away from (1,0).\n\nSo DOWN seems best.\n\nBut let me double-check the board: at (1,1), is there anything? According to the board state, row 1: all '.' so empty. Row 0: at x=1, it's 'A' for apple, but that's (1,0), not (1,1). (1,1) is between.\n\nAlso, collision with walls: (1,1) is within 0-9, so fine.\n\nEnemy movement: if snake #1 moves DOWN to (0,1), or UP to (0,3), etc., but since I'm moving to (1,1), which is not adjacent to (0,1) or anything, it should be safe. The only way we collide is if we both move to the same square, but since I'm moving to (1,1) and it's at (0,2), it can only move to (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), or (-1,2) but -1 is wall, so (0,1), (0,3), or (1,2).\n\nIf it moves to (1,2), that's fine, but I'm not there. If it moves to (0,1), no issue. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, I should move DOWN to get closer to the apple at (1,0).\n\nFor strategy: Next turn, if I move DOWN to (1,1), then I can move DOWN again to (1,0) to eat the apple. But I need to be careful of the enemy after that. But for now, this seems good.\n\nI could also consider going for other apples if something changes, but (1,0) is very close.\n\nSo my decision: DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, my current position at (1, 2) has several options. Moving LEFT to (0, 2) would collide with Snake #1, resulting in death. Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) is safe but takes me away from the closest apples. Moving UP to (1, 3) is also safe but similarly less efficient for immediate apple access. Moving DOWN to (1, 1) positions me to reach the apple at (1, 0) on the next move, which is the closest apple with a Manhattan distance of 2. This path avoids walls, other snakes, and self-collision since I have no body yet. The enemy snake at (0, 2) poses minimal risk this turn, as moving DOWN reduces proximity and potential collision paths.\n\nStrategy note for next turn: After moving DOWN, prioritize eating the apple at (1, 0) by moving DOWN again, then reassess based on new apple positions and enemy movements.\n\nNext move: DOWN",
