Its body is empty (head only).\n\n**Immediate danger assessment:**\n- **Spaces around me:**\n  - UP: (9,7) \u2014 safe and open\n  - DOWN: (9,5) \u2014 safe, but moves me away from apples\n  - LEFT: (8,6) \u2014 **apple**, also adjacent to enemy's current position at (8,5)\n  - RIGHT: (10,6) \u2014 **wall, illegal**\n- The only apple within reach is (8,6) if I move LEFT.\n\n**What can the enemy do next?**\n- Enemy at (8,5) may go:\n  - UP: (8,6) \u2014 directly for the apple (same as me, but must go UP)\n  - RIGHT: (9,5) \u2014 away from apples, less attractive\n  - LEFT: (7,5) \u2014 away from apples, less attractive\n  - DOWN: (8,4) \u2014 away from apples\n\n- **Crucially:** If both of us try to move to (8,6), I get there by moving LEFT, enemy must go UP, so only one of us can occupy the spot. In multiplayer snake, typically, if two snakes move to the same open square simultaneously from different directions, both die (head-on collision). To avoid this, I have to judge:\n    - Is the enemy snake likely to go UP? Unless they see a better apple, probably yes.\n    - Do I want to risk a head-on collision for a guaranteed apple, or should I try for safety?\n\n**Pros and cons:**\n- **LEFT:** I reach (8,6), potentially grabbing the apple. If enemy goes UP to (8,6) *at the same time*, **we'd collide, both die**. Risky.\n- **UP:** (9,7) keeps me alive, enemy probably takes (8,6), apple gone. But safe, avoids collision, gives me more options.\n- **DOWN:** (9,5) reverses my last move, moves me away from apples.\n  \n**Probability the enemy will go UP:** High\u2014unless they're risk-averse.\n\n**What do I value more?**\n- **Survival:** The apple isn't worth a 50/50 suicide, if the enemy is likely going for it. Letting them have the apple is better than dying.\n- **Aggression:** Taking the apple could pay off if enemy is risk-averse and doesn't go for it, but that's just hope.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- **Move UP to (9,7):** I avoid the risky collision. On the next turn, I will see whether the apple at (8,6) is still there (if enemy didn't take it), or plan for the next closest apple\u2014(4,9) is generally upward and left, and I'm getting closer to it by going up.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- If (8,6) apple remains (enemy didn't take), consider whether LEFT is safe to go for it then.\n- Otherwise, start making my way toward (4,9) (going UP then LEFT), or check for new apples/enemy positions.\n- If enemy dies trying to get (8,6), I may have open field for safe apple pursuit.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move:**  \n**UP**"

It will keep moving forward as normal unless I eat an apple.\n- No risk of self-block in the next moves.\n- Ample escape routes after apples, provided I don't turn up too late.\n\n## **Decision:**\n- **Move DOWN (to 4,0)**\n- This leads directly to a clear sweep of bottom apples, and is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy next turn:**\nAfter collecting apples at (1,0) and (0,0), always check for open space above before moving left again to the corner.

No other snake nearby. My own body is now trailing behind and above.\n- LEFT is 100% safe and optimal for points.\n\n## **Strategy to tell myself next turn**\n- As I approach (1,0) and then (0,0), watch my own tail: be prepared for a vertical escape at (0,0) if space at (0,1) is open. If not, may need a \"weaving\" maneuver along the bottom two rows until vertical exit is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: LEFT**"

Board position (0,2) is empty.\n- **DOWN to (0,0):**\n    - (0,0) is my own body (my neck), so moving DOWN would collide with myself. Fatal.\n- **LEFT to (-1,1):**\n    - Off-board. Fatal.\n- **RIGHT to (1,1):**\n    - (1,1) is empty (as per body: (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)), so SAFE.\n\n---\n\n## **Best Option Analysis**\n\n- **UP to (0,2):** Safe, keeps me going up the leftmost column as per plan.\n- **RIGHT to (1,1):** Safe, opens up more movement options for looping toward apples later.\n\nComparing them:\n- The apple cluster is at (2,3), (3,3), just a few squares right and up.\n- If I go UP, next turn can go UP again or RIGHT. \n- If I go RIGHT now, then NEXT turn I can go RIGHT again, or UP, also good for moving toward the apples. \n\nAm I at any risk of blocking my tail?  \nAfter this move, my tail at (2,0) will vacate, so my body would be (chosen head), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0).  \nSo both options don't block me in; good.\n\n**Should I favor UP or RIGHT?**\n- If I take RIGHT to (1,1), then next turn I could RIGHT again to (2,1), then UP, setting myself on the way to (2,3)/(3,3).\n- If I take UP to (0,2), then I can continue UP (to (0,3)), or RIGHT (to (1,2)), both eventually lead to those apples.\n- However, snaking along an edge gives more escape room if something goes wrong, and often safer. Also, given that all the apples are a bit further RIGHT, I might want to shift that way.\n\n## **Enemy risk**\nEnemy is still far, cannot reach my area in next couple turns.\n\n---\n\n## **Decision**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe.  \nRIGHT moves me toward the cluster of apples, and opens up more routing options early.  \nUP keeps me tight to the edge, but eventually I\u2019ll need to go right anyway.\n\n**Optimal path:**  \n- Move RIGHT to (1,1); next turn, plan to continue RIGHT to (2,1), and then UP toward (2,3).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for next turn:**  \nIf path ahead is clear, continue RIGHT to (2,1).  \nMonitor own tail positions so you don\u2019t cause a self-block near the wall.  \nKeep watching for the enemy starting to head south, though they're far for now.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Move**\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Their head is at (2,4).\n\n- **Apples:** (0,0), (1,0), (9,7), (7,9), (7,4)\n    - Closest: (0,0) or (1,0), but both down and quite left.\n    - Next closest: (7,4), but that's far unless heading right quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Safe Moves?**\n\nLet's check which directions are safe from my current head (2,2):\n\n- **UP (2,3):**\n    - Let's check whether this is occupied:\n        - (2,3): Enemy snake body occupies it. COLLISION if I go UP.\n- **DOWN (2,1):**\n    - My own tail currently at (2,1). But if I move, tail will vacate (since no apple), so (2,1) will be empty after move.\n    - However: IN SNAKE, unless I eat an apple, moving into your own tail's current position is legal (since it will vacate).\n    - Let's keep this as a valid move.\n- **LEFT (1,2):**  \n    - (1,2) is my own body. NO \u2013 cannot move left, would collide with own body.\n- **RIGHT (3,2):**\n    - Is (3,2) empty? Let's check board:\n        - Enemy is in column 2 above (2,3). In body list, (3,2) is NOT occupied by enemy or myself, so SAFE.\n\nSo safe moves:\n1. DOWN (if tail will vacate)\n2. RIGHT\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Evaluating each safe move**\n\n### **DOWN to (2,1):**\n- (2,1) will be vacated, as my tail, so safe.\n- Brings me a step closer to apples at (0,0),(1,0).\n- But I\u2019ll be deepening near the board\u2019s bottom left, not much escape room if I accumulate length with edge-hugging.\n- Next move from (2,1) I could:\n    - LEFT (into (1,1)), which is body at (1,1): not safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,0): not forbidden yet. Check (2,0)'s status. It's empty based on current body and enemy positions.\n    - RIGHT to (3,1): seems empty.\n\n### **RIGHT to (3,2):**\n- Opens toward the center, potentially toward apple at (7,4). \n- Next moves:\n    - UP to (3,3): danger! Enemy's body at (3,3).\n    - RIGHT to (4,2): likely empty.\n    - DOWN to (3,1): empty.\n- So, moving RIGHT keeps me away from being boxed against the lower edge, but heads somewhat toward open space.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Strategic considerations**\n- If I \"double back\" DOWN, I'm not in immediate danger, but as I continue along the bottom, I may have to make increasingly tight turns. Still, could be a safe way toward apples.\n- If I move RIGHT, I open toward apple at (7,4) and generally avoid getting cornered.\n\n- The enemy can't reach me this turn but could get closer if they head down.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Decision**\n- **UP**: Blocked by enemy body.\n- **LEFT**: Blocked by my own body.\n- **DOWN**: Safe (tail vacates), direct route to lower-left apples; slightly reduces escape room in near future.\n- **RIGHT**: Safe, more flexible, route toward center/right apples, avoids wall choke, opens more maneuver room.\n\n**Optimal for flexibility:**  \nRIGHT seems best\u2014keeps me safe, options for next few turns, and avoids getting trapped in the bottom left corner.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Summary & Next Steps**\n\n- Move: RIGHT to (3,2)\n- Strategy: Scan for safe open lines toward nearby apples, avoid running into dead ends or corners, and continue to steer clear of the enemy snake\u2019s path. Watch for enemy movement southward.\n- Next turn: Continue RIGHT if clear, consider opportunities to move UP or DOWN toward apples as board state evolves.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

DOWN is SAFE.\n\n**LEFT:** (2,2)\n- This is my own body, just vacated by the head after last move. (My body order: head now at (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)). Can't move back into body. LEFT is NOT SAFE.\n\n**RIGHT:** (4,2)\n- Is (4,2) empty?\n    - Not occupied by me or enemy. It's an empty tile. RIGHT is SAFE.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Strategic Context**\n\n- **Apples:** Closest ones are still (0,0) and (1,0), but both would require moving left and down\u2014dangerous territory as the bottom left can become cramped, and enemy is controlling the center-left vertical corridor.\n- **7,4** apple is significantly further right, but moving rightwards keeps more options open and away from enemy territory.\n- **Enemy:** Is higher on the board, vertical in column 2 with a hooked right pattern.\n\n### If I move DOWN to (3,1):\n- My body would be: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n- Next choices from (3,1):\n    - UP to (3,2): occupied just now, body\n    - LEFT to (2,1): not occupied, appears safe\n    - RIGHT to (4,1): not occupied, appears safe\n    - DOWN to (3,0): not occupied, appears safe\n\n### If I move RIGHT to (4,2):\n- My body would be: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n- Next choices from (4,2):\n    - UP to (4,3): not occupied, safe\n    - RIGHT to (5,2): not occupied, safe\n    - DOWN to (4,1): not occupied, safe\n    - LEFT to (3,2): occupied by myself\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps me in the open, with several escape routes; DOWN keeps access to lower apples and walls, but not immediate threat. Both DOWN and RIGHT are viable.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Which move is best?**\n\nPriorities:\n- Stay away from enemy area\u2014avoid columns 2 and 3 above y=4 for now.\n- Remain in open space, maintain flexibility, as snake grows soon when eating apples.\n- The right side apples may be uncontested.\n- Down remains an escape path, but going deeper toward the bottom left can quickly run you into a dead end, especially as I grow.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Preferred Move**\n\n**Move RIGHT to (4,2):**\n- Continues opening up toward right-side apples (7,4).\n- Keeps me flexible for next turn: up, right, or down available.\n- Avoids crowding bottom-left early, gives me more response time to enemy moves.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Strategy Reminder for Myself Next Turn**\n- Re-evaluate the enemy's path. If the enemy moves closer to my right, consider dodging upward rather than getting trapped in a smaller region.\n- Watch for immediate apple-gathering routes if obstacles are clear.\n- Don't get greedy for close apples if it means boxing myself in.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Moving right or down keeps distance.\n\n#### **Future Flexibility**\n- **If I move UP to (4,3):**  \n    - Next safe moves:  \n        - RIGHT (5,3) \u2014 open  \n        - UP (4,4) \u2014 open  \n        - DOWN (4,2) \u2014 where I just came from, which should be vacated as the tail moves.\n    - Paths toward (7,4) apple start opening.\n\n- **If I move DOWN to (4,1):**  \n    - Next moves:  \n        - RIGHT (5,1) \u2014 open  \n        - DOWN (4,0) \u2014 open  \n        - LEFT (3,1) \u2014 open but closer to wall  \n    - Approaching the bottom wall, but could dive toward (1,0) apple if I circle around.\n\n- **If I move RIGHT to (5,2):**  \n    - Next moves:  \n        - UP (5,3) \u2014 open  \n        - RIGHT (6,2) \u2014 open  \n        - DOWN (5,1) \u2014 open  \n    - Maximally open field, closer toward right-side apples.\n\n### 5. **Which is Best?**\n\n- **UP** and **RIGHT** both keep me in open space, away from danger.\n- **DOWN** is safe now but edges me toward the bottom, harder to escape if boxed in.\n- **LEFT** is a crash move.\n\nA key goal is ****to claim territory toward the right and higher up.**  \nMoving **RIGHT** puts me in the best position to access right-side apples, but \"UP\" also opens progress toward (7,4), which is one of the most reachable apples and keeps me in spacious territory.\n\n**But notice:**  \nIf I move RIGHT, my position next turn options are still excellent, but if I go UP, I'm more central and start \u201cverticalizing\u201d toward (7,4). The enemy is well away from (4,3) and seems likely to stay in the left-center. UP also lets me flex between moving further UP or continuing RIGHT as needed.\n\n### 6. **Final Selection and Next Turn Strategy**\n\n- **UP (4,3)** is safer because:\n    - It opens access to (7,4) in a straight-shot vertical climb with open tiles.\n    - Maintains rightward and upward flexibility.\n    - Keeps maximum distance from both walls and enemy.\n    - (5,3) is open, (4,4) is open, (5,4) is open, so path toward apple is clear.\n\n**NEXT TURN STRATEGY NOTE:**\n- If safe, keep advancing UP to (7,4), claiming the center-right corridor.\n- Watch for enemy turns; avoid being cut off in narrow lanes.\n- Don't rush to isolated apples if it means getting boxed in; favor open corridors.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"

UP \u2192 (4,4)\n- Is (4,4) free?  \n    - Not occupied by me or enemy.  \n    - Still within board.  \n    - **SAFE.**\n\n### 2. RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)\n- Is (5,3) free?  \n    - Not occupied by me or enemy.  \n    - **SAFE.**\n\n### 3. DOWN \u2192 (4,2)\n- This is my current body, but after I move, the tail at (2,2) is removed, so (4,2) will still be my body next tick but will be shifting. But in snake, moving back into your own body is only allowed if that square will be vacated. In this case, (4,2) is immediately behind my head, so it's not vacated yet (tail is (2,2)), so this move would crash into myself.\n- **NOT SAFE.**\n\n### 4. LEFT \u2192 (3,3)\n- This is occupied by the enemy snake's body.\n- **NOT SAFE.**\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Analysis\n\nWhat is my goal? Get apples\u2014but preferably the safest and most accessible one.\n\nThere are two \"zones\" of apples:\n- Bottom-left: (0,0), (1,0)  \n    - Reaching them is difficult, as my body (and the enemy body cluster) somewhat blocks the leftward path. I'd have to go through (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), but the enemy might be nearer and it's crowded. Probably not efficient.\n\n- Right-hand side: (7,4), (7,9), (9,7)  \n    - The (7,4) apple is closest and reachable by moving UP or RIGHT. The top-right apples are also open, but farther away.\n\nIs the enemy likely to block my path to (7,4)? Unlikely right away; the enemy is focused upper left/center.\n\n### From (4,3), decide between UP and RIGHT.\n\n#### If I go UP to (4,4):\n- My next positions can be (5,4) (right), (4,5) (up), (4,3) (down)\u2014with (4,3) now my neck, not safe.\n- Maintains centrality.\n- Shortest route to (7,4) is (4,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (7,4).\n\n#### If I go RIGHT to (5,3):\n- My next positions: (6,3), (5,4), (4,3) (again, backwards).\n- Still possible to reach (7,4), but kind of skirts the central vertical column.\n\n### Which is better?\n\n- UP (to 4,4) lets me advance calmly toward (7,4); I keep a maximum number of safe branches for the following turn, and approach the apple via wide space.\n- RIGHT is fine, but slightly less direct, as I'd have to go up to reach (7,4) anyway.\n\nNo enemy near enough to cut me off. Wide open. No dangers. Both safe but UP feels more direct and central.\n\n## Next move strategy\n\n- Continue toward (7,4) for easy growth.\n- Watch for sudden enemy leftward movement; avoid risky crowding.\n- If (7,4) is taken before I get there, reassess for top-right apples.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"

Current State\n\n- **My head:** (4,4)\n- **My body:** [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]\n- **Enemy head:** (4,6)\n- **Enemy body:** [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)]\n- **Apples:** (0,0), (1,0), (9,7), (7,9), (7,4)\n- **Last move:** UP (so currently facing UP)\n\n## 2. Available Moves\n\nLet's check each possible move from (4,4):\n\n### UP \u2192 (4,5)\n- (4,5) is unoccupied. Board is open above.\n- Not occupied by my body.\n- Not occupied by enemy.\n- **SAFE.**\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (4,3)\n- My body: (4,3) will still be there after moving, so moving backward is not allowed.\n- **NOT SAFE.**\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (3,4)\n- Enemy body: (3,4) is occupied.\n- **NOT SAFE.**\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)\n- (5,4) is open.\n- Not occupied by my or enemy\u2019s body.\n- **SAFE.**\n\n## 3. Strategic Considerations\n\n- **Goal:** Eat apples efficiently and avoid risk. \n- **Closest apple:** (7,4), just three steps right.\n- **Other apples:** Bottom left apples (0,0), (1,0) are far and require threading through congested territory, not optimal. Top right apples are far.\n- **Enemy risk:** Enemy head at (4,6) is located up and left, so not an immediate threat to the right.\n\n#### Compare Routes to (7,4):\n\nFrom (4,4):\n- To (7,4): (4,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (7,4)\n    - RIGHT to (5,4), then keep going right. Most direct.\n- If I go UP (to 4,5), I\u2019m not making progress toward (7,4), and I might crowd myself above with the enemy snake also somewhere up there, so RIGHT is more direct.\n\n#### What about UP?\n- From (4,4) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (5,5) or (4,6)?\n    - If enemy snake goes down toward me, cramped space; not helping my apple quest.\n\n#### What about RIGHT?\n- (5,4) is open, then (6,4), then (7,4) (apple!). Path is open, no snake pieces in sight, and maximum safety.\n\n## 4. Double-check Safety\n\n- Is RIGHT safe next turn?\n    - (6,4) is also open.\n    - No risk of running into either snake.\n- Are there any tricky risks?\n    - If enemy snake suddenly moves down/left, still not able to cut me off in one turn; also, with my move priority, I\u2019ll be okay.\n\n## 5. Strategy for next turn\n\n- **Idea:** Continue RIGHT toward (7,4) unless blocked. If the apple at (7,4) is eaten, consider proceeding toward the top-right apples (7,9), (9,7).\n\n---\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**\n\n#### (Strategy for next turn:**\n- If (7,4) is still available, keep right. If blocked by enemy or body, reassess safe escape (UP or DOWN depending on enemy head). If apple is gone, plot course to nearest apple (top-right most likely) via safe path.)\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Apple Proximity\n\n- **(7,4)** is the closest apple and to the RIGHT (i.e., at (6,4), (7,4)) -- direct path.\n- **(9,7) and (7,9)** both farther away, top right.\n- **(0,0), (1,0)** bottom left -- distant and lots of snake and walls in the way.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Enemy Snake Risk\n\n- Enemy head is up and left from me at (4,7), with body mostly upper left and mid left.  \n- Enemy cannot threaten my immediate path to (7,4) next turn.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Move Safety\n\n### RIGHT (6,4)\n- (6,4) is safe.\n- No snake there.\n- Next turn I can move to (7,4), which has an apple.\n\n### UP (5,5)\n- (5,5) is open, but doesn't move me toward apples.\n- Safe for now, but less efficient.\n\n### DOWN (5,3)\n- (5,3) is safe.\n- Not backward into myself.\n- But doesn't advance me toward any apples efficiently, unless blocked.\n\n### LEFT (4,4)\n- Not allowed; that's my previous head (can't go backward).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Strategic Consideration\n\n- **RIGHT toward (7,4) apple is optimal.**  \n- (6,4) is open, allowing for an easy next move.\n- No enemy snake can threaten the path, and there's no wall issue.\n- After grabbing (7,4), check for next nearest apple (most likely (7,9) or (9,7)), preferably whichever is safer depending on enemy moves.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Double-Check for Surprises\n\n- Enemy cannot reach (6,4) next turn.\n- No body part or tail moves block my way.\n- Path looks completely open for RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- If (7,4) apple still there, keep heading RIGHT to eat it.\n- If it's gone, re-evaluate nearest safe apple: likely (7,9) or (9,7).\n- Always be wary of enemy approaching from above on y = 6-7.\n\n---\n\n# Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

But for now, UP remains best.\n\n---\n\n## **Decision**\n\n**Next move:** UP\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for next turn:**  \nIf (7,5) is still clear, keep moving UP toward (7,9). Watch enemy moves\u2014if they start heading up, be ready to switch target to (9,7) or even escape to the right.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"
