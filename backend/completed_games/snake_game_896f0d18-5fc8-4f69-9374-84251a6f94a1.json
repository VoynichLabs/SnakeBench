However, (4, 1) is also reachable and a bit safer since it's diagonal from Snake #0\u2019s head.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The closest and safest seems to be (4, 1).\n- If I grab it, I increase my score and stay in a good corner position.\n\nThus, my next move will be:\n\n**UP**\n\nThis puts me at (8, 4), on track for the apple at (4, 1) for my first bite.
