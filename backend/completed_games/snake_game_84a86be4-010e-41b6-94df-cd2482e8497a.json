Available space is up and right, but apple at (9,7) is accessible via (8,7), which is one step up-left from (8,7) or directly via right and up. To reach the (9,7) apple efficiently, moving UP to (5,9) is invalid (off-board), so the only safe path involves moving RIGHT, then UP. But since apple (9,7) is diagonally one up-right from head, moving UP directly to (5,9) is off-board (max y=9, but row 9 is row 0? Wait \u2014 reversal alert: in the board, (9,7) is at row 7, col 9. Current board coordinates: (x,y) corresponds to column x row y? Wait \u2014 in standard grid, (col, row) = (x,y). The apple at (9,7) means column 9, row 7. But current board shows row 7 as row index 7 (so line 7), column 9 at row 7 is at position (9,7) \u2014 yes. Current head (5,8): x=5, y=8, so (col=5, row=8). The apple (9,7) is two cells below (row 8 to 9) and two left (col 5 to 9). From (5,8) to (9,7): move right 4 and down 1 \u2014 too far in one step.\n\nBest immediate move: move RIGHT to (6,8). From (5,8), right \u2192 (6,8). Now adjacent to (9,7)? Not yet, but now we\u2019re closer. The apple at (9,7) is to the lower right. From (6,8), we can aim toward (9,7) by going RIGHT and DOWN.

From (5,8), the closest apple is at (9,7), which is above and right \u2014 specifically, 4 right and 1 down. But I can't jump \u2014 moves are one cell per turn. The best immediate route is to move UP to (5,9), then RIGHT to (9,9), then DOWN? But that seems lengthy. Alternatively, after reaching (5,9) (last punch was UP), I can move RIGHT to (6,8), then RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then UP/RIGHT to (9,7). But that's long.\n\nWait \u2014 the apple at (9,7) is adjacent diagonally to (8,8). From head at (5,8), moving RIGHT twice and DOWN two: (5\u21926\u21927\u21928, 8\u21927\u21926\u21927)? No \u2014 better: from (5,8), move RIGHT to (6,8), then RIGHT to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7), then RIGHT to (9,7). That\u2019s 5 moves.\n\nBut better: from (5,8) \u2192 UP to (5,9) [safe, adjacent, apples visible now], then RIGHT 4 cells to (9,9)? No \u2014 (9,7) is at col 9 row 7, while (9,9) is col 9 row 9 \u2014 too far up.\n\nWe must prioritize efficiency toward (9,7). The head (5,8) is 4 right and 1 down from (9,7). So a viable next step is RIGHT to (6,8). From (6,8), we can then move RIGHT again to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then RIGHT and UP? Or: from (8,8), move DOWN (8,7), then RIGHT (9,7) \u2014 yes! That lands exactly on an apple.\n\nSo plan:  \n1. Move RIGHT to (6,8)  \n2.",
