My body ends at (2, 8).\n\nLet's analyze the potential moves:\n\n*   **UP:**  My head goes to (2, 8). This is where my body currently is. This is a self-collision and I die.\n*   **DOWN:** My head goes to (2, 6). This moves me toward the apple at (0, 6) and (5, 6) and away from the apple at (9,1). It seems viable.\n*   **LEFT:**  My head goes to (1, 7).  This might put me closer to the apple at (1,6) but isn't immediately a clear path.\n*   **RIGHT:** My head goes to (3, 7). This leads towards no immediate apples, and doesn\u2019t appear useful.\n\nThe UP move is immediately fatal. The RIGHT move appears useless.  The LEFT move is possible but doesn\u2019t have obvious benefit. DOWN moves towards the apples at (0,6) and (5,6). I need to avoid self-collision too!\n\nSince I was just at (2,9), it suggests I moved down and my body is at (2,8). So UP is a self-collision. I think the best next move is to go DOWN; it gets me closer to apples and avoids immediate collisions.\n\nDOWN",
