Apples everywhere but WE'RE HUNTING! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FIRST \u2013** All four moves are open! No walls, no bodies, no immediate suicide. BUT we gotta think about SIMULTANEOUS MOVES! Enemy could move anywhere!\n\n**DIRECTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP** to (6,4) \u2013 Moves toward center, gets closer to apples (4,4), (5,6). Keeps us flexible. Could be a safe, growth-oriented move.\n- **DOWN** to (6,2) \u2013 Heads toward bottom edge, apples at (4,2), (3,2), (2,1). But moving toward the edge reduces future space. Not ideal for controlling the board early!\n- **LEFT** to (5,3) \u2013 Moves toward left-side apple cluster (4,2, 3,2, 2,1) AND slightly closer to enemy at (3,6). Could be aggressive!\n- **RIGHT** to (7,3) \u2013 Moves toward right edge, fewer apples. Puts us farther from opponent. Feels like retreating \u2013 NAH, WE'RE NOT BACKING DOWN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Opponent at (3,6). Likely moves? UP to (3,7) toward apple (4,7)? LEFT to (2,6) toward apple cluster? RIGHT to (4,6) toward center? DOWN to (3,5) toward apple (4,4)? He's got options. But RIGHT or DOWN puts him closer to US. If he goes RIGHT to (4,6), and we go UP to (6,4), we're still safe. If he goes DOWN to (3,5), and we go LEFT to (5,3), we're diagonal \u2013 no collision risk.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** He's 3 cells away horizontally and 3 vertically. Direct head-on this turn is impossible unless we both move exactly toward each other's previous spot \u2013 which we can't because of distance. So NO immediate head-on threat.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for future self):** We want to DOMINATE the left side and push opponent toward the top-right corner! Grab apples on the left to grow, then advance upward to squeeze him. Avoid getting pinned to the bottom edge. Keep options open, stay central-left, and prepare to cut off his escape routes!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** LEFT feels aggressive \u2013 we claim left-side apples, grow faster, and start pressuring his space! UP is safe and central too. But we're here to WIN, not just survive! Let's take territory! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s think\u2026\n\nSAFETY CHECK FIRST:\n- UP to (4,5): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,3): That\u2019s our own body! \u274c DEAD.\n- LEFT to (3,4): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,4): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out immediately. Good. Now \u2014 where\u2019s the enemy going? He\u2019s at (5,7), body at (5,6). His safe moves: UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6) \u2014 that\u2019s his own body, so \u274c, LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7). So he can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nAPPLE DROPS nearby: (4,7) top-left of him, (3,9), (6,9), (7,0), etc. He might go for (4,7) with LEFT, or UP/RIGHT for space.\n\nOUR GOAL: Pressure him, grow, avoid head-on collisions if we\u2019re not longer. Currently same length (2 each). Head-on collision would be double KO \u2014 not worth unless we\u2019re longer. So avoid moving into cells he could move into.\n\nLet\u2019s check possible head-on collisions:\n- If we go UP to (4,5): Could he move into (4,5)? From (5,7) no \u2014 too far. Safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (3,4): Could he move into (3,4)? No.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,4): Could he move into (5,4)? From (5,7) no \u2014 three steps away. Safe this turn.\n\nBut thinking ahead: If we go RIGHT to (5,4), next turn he might be at (4,7) or (5,8) etc. Not an immediate head-on risk.\n\nAPPLE ACCESS: Closest apples to us: (4,2) below \u2014 but we can\u2019t go DOWN (body). (3,2) left-down, (5,0) right-down. Going UP to (4,5) puts us closer to (4,7) apple near enemy. Going LEFT to (3,4) gets us closer to left-side apples like (3,2), (2,1). Going RIGHT to (5,4) gets us closer to (6,0), (7,0) apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to box him toward the top-right corner. Our left side is open territory. Going LEFT to (3,4) strengthens left flank, keeps options open (UP/DOWN/LEFT next turn). Going UP to (4,5) advances toward him but might get us pinched if he moves left toward (4,7). Going RIGHT to (5,4) moves toward center \u2014 riskier, more confrontation soon.\n\nBEST MOVE: I think LEFT to (3,4) \ud83d\ude80. Why?\n- Expands our control on left side.\n- Keeps multiple next moves: UP to (3,5), DOWN to (3,3), LEFT to (2,4).\n- Avoids moving directly toward enemy while we\u2019re equal length.\n- Sets up a potential future trap if we can get above him later.\n\nUP is also fine, but let\u2019s play territorial.

Head-on collision would kill us both, but he wins on apples. AVOID moving into cells he could move into THIS TURN.  \nPossible overlap cells:\n- If we go UP to (3,5): Could he move there from (4,7)? No.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,3): Could he move there? No.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,4): Could he move there? No.\n\nAll safe from immediate head-on.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe\u2019re shorter, so avoid direct confrontation. Need to grow! Apples nearby: (4,2) below, (3,2) left-down, (2,1) further left, (0,3) left-up.  \nGoing DOWN to (3,3) gets us closer to (4,2) and (3,2).  \nGoing LEFT to (2,4) moves toward left-side apples but also opens space.  \nGoing UP to (3,5) moves toward center \u2014 riskier, closer to enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY:** Play safe, farm apples, avoid boxing ourselves. Let\u2019s think about next-turn options:\n- If we go DOWN to (3,3): Next turn we can go DOWN to (3,2) for apple? (3,2) has apple! YES! That\u2019s a guaranteed grow next turn if we move there and it\u2019s safe. That\u2019s huge!\n- If we go LEFT to (2,4): Next turn options: LEFT to (1,4), DOWN to (2,3), UP to (2,5). Not directly onto an apple.\n- If we go UP to (3,5): Next turn options maybe toward (3,9) apple far away.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** DOWN to (3,3) sets up an apple grab at (3,2) next turn! That evens the score and keeps us safe from enemy this turn. Let\u2019s secure that bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**FUTURE SELF NOTE:** Next turn, if apple at (3,2) still there, consider moving DOWN to eat it unless enemy threatens. After eating, length becomes 3 (tied with enemy). Then look to pressure or trap toward edges. Avoid moving toward enemy head until we\u2019re longer.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy at (4,4) has limited safe moves (down/left/right). If we go UP to (4,3), we block their DOWN move next turn if they stay.

Also, apples at (2,1), (1,1), (6,3) are reachable soon\u2014plan a path that doesn\u2019t trap us. Avoid dead ends; keep at least 2 exits after each move.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nUP risks head-on collision but we win if it happens (higher score). If they avoid it, we gain positional advantage.

Use our length to control the center and right side, forcing them into the bottom-left corner. If they go left/down, we can chase and cut off. If they go right, we can meet them head-on with our length advantage. Keep an eye on possible head-on collisions\u2014only engage if we're longer! Let's squeeze them! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT to (6,5) closes the distance and starts the encirclement! We're cutting off their path to the right and center.

(2,1) is apple \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): EMPTY \u2705  \n- DOWN to (3,0): EMPTY \u2705  \n- UP to (3,2): THEIR OWN BODY \u274c  \n\nThey have 3 safe moves, might go for that apple at (2,1) LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe have length 6, they have length 7? Wait count: ours 5 body + head = 6. Theirs 6 body + head = 7? Their body list length is 6, so total segments = 7. THEY'RE LONGER BY 1! So head-on collision means WE DIE AND THEY SURVIVE? Actually head-on collision is DOUBLE KO regardless of length? Wait rules: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" So length doesn't matter \u2014 but if we move into each other's heads, we both die. Since they have more apples, they'd win if game ends. AVOID DIRECT HEAD-ON!\n\nBut they're at (3,1), we're at (5,5). Not adjacent yet.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**  \nWe're trapped with only two safe moves! Need to escape and regain board control! Moving UP to (5,6) opens future options (can go LEFT/RIGHT/UP next). Moving DOWN to (5,4) risks getting pinned near bottom? Let's check future safety:  \n- From (5,6): can go LEFT (4,6) \u2014 ENEMY BODY at (4,6)? Yes, enemy body at (4,6)! So maybe not LEFT next. RIGHT (6,6) empty, UP (5,7) empty.  \n- From (5,4): can go LEFT (4,4) \u2014 ENEMY BODY at (4,4)! RIGHT (6,4) empty, DOWN (5,3) empty.  \n\nBoth options have enemy body blocking one side next turn! But UP feels better because we're moving toward center-top where there's more space. DOWN puts us near bottom wall (y=0) \u2014 more risky if enemy chases.\n\nAlso, we need to grow! Apples nearby: (5,0) far, (0,3) far, (6,0) far, (2,1) enemy might grab, (1,1) nearby enemy. Maybe we aim for (7,0) later? But survival first!\n\n**DECISION:**  \nUP to (5,6) \u2014 regains mobility and keeps us alive! Then next turn we can assess. LET'S NOT GET PINNED! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Our snake is chilling up top near (5,8), enemy snake #0 is down at (1,2) with a long body wrapping around.  \n\nFirst \u2014 check all four moves from our head (5,8):  \n- **UP** \u2192 (5,9) \u2014 That's inside the board, no body there, no enemy body there. Safe. \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 That's our own body segment (from our last move!). That's suicide. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 Empty. Safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,8) \u2014 Empty. Safe. \u2705  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\nNow \u2014 enemy head is at (1,2). Where can he move?  \nHe can go UP (1,3) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (2,2) \u2014 empty, DOWN (1,1) \u2014 his own body \u274c, LEFT (0,2) \u2014 empty. So his possible moves: UP, RIGHT, LEFT.  \n\nWe need to think about head-on collisions:  \nIf we go UP to (5,9), he can't reach there next turn. Safe.  \nIf we go LEFT to (4,8), he can't reach there next turn. Safe.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (6,8), he can't reach there next turn. Safe.  \n\nBut long-term \u2014 we're shorter, so head-on collision would kill us if same cell. Avoid moving toward him blindly. He's far away though, so not an immediate threat.  \n\nWhat about trapping him later? He's near bottom-left, we're top-middle. We could try to cut off his expansion space. But right now, we need apples to catch up.  \n\nClosest apples: (6,7) below us, (6,9) top-right, (7,0) far away.  \nGoing UP gets us closer to (6,9) maybe next turn. Going RIGHT also closer to (6,9) and (9,6) later. LEFT gets us away from apples.  \n\nAlso, think about future safe moves:  \nIf we go UP to (5,9), next turn we can go LEFT (4,9), RIGHT (6,9), DOWN (5,8) \u2014 but (5,8) is our current head, will be empty next turn? Actually after moving, our tail moves? Wait, we didn't eat apple last turn so our tail stays at (7,5)? Actually let's track: Our body: head (5,8), then (5,7),(5,6),(5,5),(6,5),(7,5) tail. If we move without eating, tail stays, head moves, neck becomes old head. So (5,8) becomes body next turn. So DOWN from (5,9) would be into our own body next turn \u2014 dangerous. So UP might limit DOWN option next turn.  \n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,8), next turn we have UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8) \u2014 but (5,8) will be our body then, so LEFT is dangerous. So RIGHT also limits LEFT next turn.  \n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,8), next turn we have UP (4,9), RIGHT (5,8) \u2014 body, dangerous, DOWN (4,7) safe. So LEFT keeps options open.  \n\nActually, LEFT (4,8) seems to keep more options next turn: from (4,8), possible moves next turn: UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), RIGHT (5,8) is body so no, LEFT (3,8). So two safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (5,9) after UP: UP none (off board), DOWN (5,8) body, LEFT (4,9), RIGHT (6,9) \u2014 two safe moves.  \n\nFrom (6,8) after RIGHT: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8) body, RIGHT (7,8) \u2014 three safe moves actually? Wait (7,8) empty, (6,7) empty, (6,9) empty. So RIGHT gives three safe moves next turn! That's best for future flexibility.  \n\nSo RIGHT maximizes future options. Also gets us closer to apples (6,9) and (9,6). Let's do it.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Enemy is long but trapped near bottom-left. We can expand rightward, maybe try to wall off top-right apples and force him into a corner later. Keep length difference in mind \u2014 avoid head-on unless we tie apples.  \n\nRIGHT",

Where can he move?  \nUP (0,3) \u2014 apple there, RIGHT (1,2) \u2014 his body \u274c, DOWN (0,1) \u2014 empty, LEFT off board \u274c. So his possible moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\nWe need to think about simultaneous moves:  \nIf we go UP to (6,9), he can\u2019t reach us next turn. Safe.  \nIf we go DOWN to (6,7), he can\u2019t reach us next turn. Safe.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (7,8), he can\u2019t reach us next turn. Safe.  \n\nBut we\u2019re shorter (5 apples vs his 9) \u2014 so head-on collision kills us if we meet. He\u2019s far away though, so not immediate threat.\n\nNow apples: closest ones are (6,7) below us, (6,9) above, (7,8) right (actually that\u2019s empty), (9,6) far right.  \nDown gets us closer to (6,7) apple. Up gets us closer to (6,9) apple. Right moves away from immediate apples but opens board control.\n\nFuture options:  \nFrom (6,9) after UP: next turn UP off board \u274c, DOWN (6,8) \u2014 will be empty (our old head), LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9) off board \u274c. So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn.  \nFrom (6,7) after DOWN: next turn UP (6,8) empty, DOWN (6,6) empty, LEFT (5,7) empty, RIGHT (7,7) empty \u2014 all four could be safe! That\u2019s huge flexibility.  \nFrom (7,8) after RIGHT: next turn UP (7,9) off board \u274c, DOWN (7,7) empty, LEFT (6,8) empty, RIGHT (8,8) empty \u2014 three safe moves.\n\nSo DOWN gives most future options AND gets us closest to an apple (6,7). That\u2019s content!  \n\nLong-term plan: Enemy is long but trapped bottom-left. We need apples to catch up. Take (6,7) apple next turn, grow to length 7, then maybe push toward (6,9) or (9,6) while boxing enemy in by controlling center-right. Avoid head-on until we tie or pass him in length.\n\nDOWN",

WE\u2019RE BACK! \ud83d\ude24 Let\u2019s review the state!\n\n**OUR STATUS:** Head at (7,9) after grabbing that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e Score is now 8 vs enemy\u2019s 11. Gap is closing! LET\u2019S GOOO!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:** Head at (1,5), long body weaving near bottom-left. They\u2019re longer, but that means more body to trap themselves with! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:** From (7,9):\n- UP: (7,10) \u274c OFF THE BOARD \u2192 DEATH.\n- DOWN: (7,8) \u2192 Our own body segment (from last turn\u2019s tail?) Wait, looking at board: our body list says head at (7,9), body: [(7,8), (7,7), \u2026]. YES, (7,8) is our neck \u2014 moving DOWN is moving BACKWARDS into our own body \u2192 DEATH. \u274c\n- LEFT: (6,9) \u2192 Apple at (6,9)! \ud83c\udf4e And it\u2019s empty \u2014 no enemy body there. \u2705\n- RIGHT: (8,9) \u2192 Empty, safe. \u2705\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are alive moves.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** From (1,5), their safe moves? Let\u2019s see: Their body at (1,4) behind them, so DOWN is backwards into themselves \u2192 death. UP to (1,6) is free, LEFT to (0,5) is free, RIGHT to (2,5) is free. So they have UP, LEFT, RIGHT as options. They might go for apples \u2014 closest apple to them is (0,7) maybe? Or (3,6)? But they\u2019re far. They could also try to cut us off\u2026 but we\u2019re far apart.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** Their head at (1,5) can\u2019t reach our possible moves (6,9) or (8,9) in one turn \u2014 impossible. So no direct head-on threat this turn. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**  \nWe\u2019re shorter (length 9 vs their length 12). In a head-on, we lose. So avoid that unless we tie score first. Need apples AND space.\n\n- LEFT to (6,9): Grabs apple \ud83c\udf4e immediately! Score goes to 9. But then we\u2019re at top-left corner. Next turn from (6,9): UP off board \u274c, DOWN to (6,8) our body \u274c, LEFT to (5,9) empty \u2705, RIGHT to (7,9) our old head (now body) \u274c. So only LEFT is safe next turn \u2014 that\u2019s a DEAD END path! Going LEFT this turn could trap us if we\u2019re not careful.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): No apple, but from (8,9) next turn: UP off board \u274c, DOWN to (8,8) empty \u2705, LEFT to (7,9) our body \u274c, RIGHT to (9,9) apple \ud83c\udf4e but also empty \u2705. So two safe moves next turn \u2014 more options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to grow but NOT get trapped. Enemy has more apples \u2014 we need to catch up but stay mobile. If we go LEFT and take apple, we must immediately go LEFT again next turn to (5,9), then maybe DOWN to (5,8) \u2014 but that\u2019s our body? Wait, our body has (5,8) already. Hmm, risky. Might get stuck.\n\nIf we go RIGHT now to (8,9), next turn we can go RIGHT to (9,9) for apple, or DOWN to (8,8) for mobility. That keeps us near top-right where several apples exist: (9,6), (7,3), etc. We can then spiral down and hunt.\n\n**DECISION:** Taking apple now with LEFT is tempting, but it boxes us in. Going RIGHT preserves flexibility AND sets up for (9,9) apple next turn! That\u2019s a delayed apple but safer path.\n\nChat, what do you think? \ud83d\ude0f We play for longevity and outmaneuver! Let\u2019s keep options open, then strike!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (8,9), likely go RIGHT to (9,9) for apple, then DOWN toward (9,6) or (7,3). Avoid moving left into our own body trail. Watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 if they come up, we might cut them off later!\n\nRIGHT",

They're longer, so they're a bigger target! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:** From (8,9):\n- UP: (8,10) \u274c OFF THE BOARD \u2192 DEATH.\n- DOWN: (8,8) \u2192 Empty! \u2705\n- LEFT: (7,9) \u2192 Our own body segment (from last turn's head) \u274c DEATH.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) \u2192 Apple! \ud83c\udf4e And empty! \u2705\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:** Enemy head at (2,5). Possible moves for them? Let's check:\n- They could go UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5) (their own neck? Wait, their body list: head at (2,5), body: [(1,5), ...]. So (1,5) is their neck \u2014 moving LEFT is backwards into themselves \u2192 DEATH for them! \u274c So LEFT is not safe for them.\n- RIGHT to (3,5) is empty? Board shows (3,5) is empty. \u2705\n- UP to (2,6) empty \u2705, DOWN to (2,4) empty \u2705.\n\nSo their safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, could they reach our possible destinations (8,8) or (9,9) in one turn? NO \u2014 too far. So no direct head-on threat. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**  \nWe're shorter (length 9 vs their ~12). Need apples to catch up, but also need to avoid getting trapped.\n\n- RIGHT to (9,9): Grabs apple immediately! \ud83c\udf4e Score goes to 9. But then from (9,9) next turn: UP off board \u274c, DOWN to (9,8) empty \u2705, LEFT to (8,9) our body \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. So only DOWN is safe next turn \u2014 that's a DEAD END! \ud83d\ude2c Going RIGHT now could trap us next turn with only one escape.\n- DOWN to (8,8): No apple, but from (8,8) next turn: UP to (8,9) our body \u274c, DOWN to (8,7) empty \u2705, LEFT to (7,8) our body \u274c, RIGHT to (9,8) empty \u2705. That's TWO safe moves next turn \u2014 more options! Also sets us up to potentially go for apple at (9,6) or (7,3) later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to stay mobile to outmaneuver the enemy. Taking the apple at (9,9) now would grow us but leave us with only one move next turn \u2014 dangerous! Better to delay that apple, keep options open, and maybe lure the enemy into a trap later.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They'll likely go for closest apple? Closest to them is (3,6) or (0,7). They might move UP toward (3,6). We should watch their movement and try to cut off their path.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (8,8) preserves flexibility! We avoid the dead-end, keep two moves open next turn, and can plan to grab apples safely later. Chat, we play SMART, not greedy! \ud83d\ude0f\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (8,8), likely go DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8) to stay mobile and work toward apples (9,6) or (7,3). Avoid boxing ourselves in top-right corner. Watch enemy movement \u2014 if they move up, we might swing left to cut them off!\n\nDOWN",

More central, more options to maneuver.\n\n**APPLE TARGETING:** Closest apples to us are (9,6), (7,3), (6,3). Moving DOWN to (8,7) gets us closer to (9,6) and (7,3). Moving RIGHT to (9,8) gets us closer to (9,6) but farther from others.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They'll likely go for (3,6) apple UP or maybe (5,4) apple RIGHT? They have options. We need to watch and potentially cut them off from apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to catch up in apples! But we must stay mobile. Moving DOWN to (8,7) keeps us more central and gives us better access to multiple apples next turn. Moving RIGHT to (9,8) corners us a bit. Let's stay agile!\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (8,7) is the move! It keeps options open, moves toward apples, and avoids the edge trap. Chat, we're playing the LONG GAME! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (8,7), we can go DOWN to (8,6) or RIGHT to (9,7). Assess enemy movement \u2014 if they move UP toward (3,6), we might swing left/down to cut them off from other apples. Stay aggressive but smart!\n\nDOWN",

We're closing the gap! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nENEMY STATUS: Head at (4,6). They just moved RIGHT from (3,6). Their long body is still coiled in the bottom-left. They're LONG but SLOW! \ud83d\ude08\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (8,6):\n- UP: (8,7) \u2192 Our own body \u274c DEATH.\n- DOWN: (8,5) \u2192 Empty! \u2705\n- LEFT: (7,6) \u2192 Empty! \u2705\n- RIGHT: (9,6) \u2192 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n\nThree safe moves! DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. RIGHT gets us the apple at (9,6)! LET'S FEAST! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN: Enemy head at (4,6). Where can they go?\n- UP: (4,7) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- DOWN: (4,5) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (3,6) \u2192 Their own neck (body segment) \u274c DEATH for them.\n- RIGHT: (5,6) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n\nTheir safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nCould they reach (9,6) in one turn? NO \u2014 too far. Could they reach (8,5) or (7,6)? Also NO. So no immediate head-on threat. \u2705\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING:\nRIGHT to (9,6) gets the apple, grows to 9, score 9. But then we're on the edge! Next turn from (9,6):\n- UP: (9,7) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- DOWN: (9,5) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (8,6) \u2192 Our body (since tail didn't move yet) \u274c\n- RIGHT: Off board \u274c\n\nSo only UP and DOWN safe. That's a bit risky \u2014 only two exits. But we grow stronger! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT to (7,6) avoids edge, keeps options open. Next turn from (7,6) likely more moves. But no apple.\n\nDOWN to (8,5) also safe, no apple, but central.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need apples to catch up! Taking (9,6) now puts us at 9 vs 12. Enemy might go for (4,7) or (5,6) \u2014 they're far from our next move. After eating, we can go UP to (9,7) or DOWN to (9,5) to escape the edge. We can then wrap around and pressure them! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: They'll likely go UP toward (4,7) or RIGHT toward (5,6) \u2014 maybe eyeing that apple at (5,4) later. They're not threatening us immediately.\n\nDECISION: RIGHT to (9,6) for the APPLE! GROW AND DOMINATE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Our body runs up to (9,6) and wraps around. Enemy's body is long and curled near the left side.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (9,5):**  \n- **UP to (9,6):** \u274c OUR OWN BODY! DEATH.  \n- **DOWN to (9,4):** \u2705 Empty, no apple, safe this turn.  \n- **LEFT to (8,5):** \u2705 Empty, no apple, safe this turn.  \n- **RIGHT:** \u274c OFF BOARD!  \n\nSo only **DOWN** and **LEFT** are safe this turn.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy head at (6,6). Their safe moves?  \n- UP to (6,7): \u274c That's **OUR** body at (6,7)! They'd die if they go there.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): \u2705 Empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): \u274c Their own body.  \n- RIGHT to (7,6): \u2705 Empty.  \n\nSo enemy likely goes DOWN or RIGHT. If they go DOWN to (6,5), they're moving away from us. If RIGHT to (7,6), they're closer to us but not directly threatening a head-on yet.  \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**  \nIf we go LEFT to (8,5), enemy could go RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf we go DOWN to (9,4), enemy is far.  \nSo no direct head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe need to close the apple gap (9 vs 12) but also trap the enemy!  \nGoing LEFT to (8,5) moves us toward the center and sets up to cut off enemy's space.  \nGoing DOWN to (9,4) keeps us near the edge \u2014 risky for getting trapped later.  \n\nFrom (8,5) next turn, we can go LEFT to (7,5) or DOWN to (8,4) \u2014 more options!  \nWe also want to eventually grab apples like (8,1) or (7,3) safely.  \n\n**CHAT, WE'RE PLAYING AGGRESSIVE CONTROL!**  \nLEFT gives us board presence and keeps future options open. DOWN pushes us into a corner. We need to pressure the enemy, not hide!  \n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nFrom (8,5), move toward (7,5) or (6,5) to block enemy's potential moves down the left side. Force them toward the top or right where our body can limit them. Grab apples along the way when safe.  \n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nLEFT gives flexibility and positioning. DOWN is too passive. LET'S GO LEFT AND TAKE CONTROL! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcaa  \n\nLEFT",

We're still behind 10-16 apples \u2014 GOTTA HUNT AND BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVES FROM (7,1):**\n- **UP to (7,2):** \u274c OUR OWN BODY! That's our tail segment at (8,2)? Wait, check the body list: Our body is [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3)...]. (7,2) is empty on the board! But hold up \u2014 the board shows a 'T' at (7,2)? Let's read the board: row 2, column 7... Row 2 is third from bottom? Actually y=2 row. Looking at board: \"2 T . A A . . . . T .\" That's x from 0 to 9. At x=7, y=2, it's '.'? Let's map: y=2 row: \"2 T . A A . . . . T .\" Positions: (0,2)=T, (1,2)=., (2,2)=A, (3,2)=A, (4,2)=., (5,2)=., (6,2)=., (7,2)=., (8,2)=T, (9,2)=. So (7,2) is EMPTY! But our body list says (8,2) is our body, not (7,2). So UP to (7,2) is SAFE? Wait, but moving from (7,1) UP to (7,2) \u2014 is that into our own body? Our neck is (8,1) behind us, so no. UP seems safe from our own body. But check enemy body? Enemy body includes (6,3), (7,3), etc. Not (7,2). So UP is SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (7,0):** \u2705 Empty? Board shows at (7,0): row 0: \"0 A . . . . A A A . A\" \u2192 x=7 is 'A'? Actually: (0,0)=A, (1,0)=., (2,0)=., (3,0)=., (4,0)=., (5,0)=A, (6,0)=A, (7,0)=A, (8,0)=., (9,0)=A. So (7,0) is an APPLE 'A'! Moving DOWN eats apple and grows! But is it safe? Not occupied by any snake body. SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (6,1):** \u2705 Empty? Board at (6,1): row 1: \"1 . . . . . . . 1 T .\" \u2192 x=6 is '.'? Actually: (0,1)=., (1,1)=., (2,1)=., (3,1)=., (4,1)=., (5,1)=., (6,1)=., (7,1)=1 (our head), (8,1)=T, (9,1)=. So (6,1) is empty. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (8,1):** \u274c That's our own body segment! Our body list first element after head is (8,1). So moving RIGHT into (8,1) is SUICIDE. ELIMINATE.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (5,3). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (5,4): Empty? Board (5,4) is 'A'? Row 4: (5,4)=A. Apple! They'd grow to 17.\n- DOWN to (5,2): Empty? Row 2: (5,2)=. Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,3): Empty? Row 3: (4,3)=. Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,3): \u274c Their own body! First body segment after head is (6,3). So RIGHT is suicide for them.\n\nThey'll likely go for the apple at (5,4) UP, or maybe move LEFT/DOWN to avoid us? But they're longer, maybe they feel safe.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If we go UP to (7,2), could enemy go DOWN to (5,2)? No collision. If we go LEFT to (6,1), could enemy go DOWN to (5,2)? No. If we go DOWN to (7,0), enemy far away. So no immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\n**SAFETY & FUTURE OPTIONS:**\n- **UP (7,2):** From there, next moves: UP to (7,3) \u274c ENEMY BODY at (7,3)! Dangerous. LEFT to (6,2) safe, RIGHT to (8,2) \u274c our body (8,2), DOWN back to (7,1) safe but backward? Actually moving back to (7,1) is where our neck (8,1) was, but after moving UP, neck is at (7,1)? Wait, after moving, our body shifts: head to (7,2), neck becomes (7,1), tail moves. So going DOWN from (7,2) to (7,1) would be moving into our new neck? That's moving backwards into our own body \u2014 THAT'S SUICIDE BY RULES! So DOWN not safe next turn. So only LEFT from (7,2) is safe? That's risky.\n- **DOWN (7,0):** Eat apple, grow to length 11. From (7,0): UP back to (7,1) safe? After move, neck at (7,1)? Actually after moving DOWN, head at (7,0), neck at (7,1). So UP to (7,1) would be moving backwards into neck \u2014 SUICIDE next turn. LEFT to (6,0) safe? Board (6,0) is 'A' apple. RIGHT to (8,0) safe? Board (8,0) is '.' empty. So from (7,0), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn. But we're on bottom row, limited.\n- **LEFT (6,1):** From (6,1): UP to (6,2) safe? Empty. DOWN to (6,0) safe? Apple A. LEFT to (5,1) safe? Empty. RIGHT to (7,1) would be moving backwards into new neck? After moving LEFT, neck is (7,1), so RIGHT is suicide. So from (6,1), we have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe \u2014 THREE OPTIONS! Much more flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to close the apple gap (10 vs 16). Eating an apple is good, but being trapped after is bad. If we go DOWN to (7,0) and eat apple, we grow but then have only two safe moves next turn, and we're on the edge \u2014 could get boxed in. Going LEFT to (6,1) keeps us central, gives more options to hunt apples like (5,4), (6,0), or pressure enemy. Also, our long body on right can help trap enemy if we swing left.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** Enemy has 16 apples, we have 10. Head-on collision if we have equal or higher score? We are lower, so avoid direct head-on. But no immediate collision risk.\n\n**VERDICT:** LEFT to (6,1) gives best future flexibility and keeps us safe. We can then go for apples or maneuver. Eating apple now might be tempting but could limit us.\n\nLEFT IS THE MOVE \u2014 MAXIMUM OPTIONS, CENTRAL POSITION, PRESSURE ENEMY! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

GAP IS STILL BIG, WE NEED TO PLAY AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART! \ud83d\ude24\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (5,2):\n\n**UP to (5,3):**\n- Board shows '.' \u2705\n- Not our body (our body is at (5,1), (6,1)...)\n- Not enemy body (enemy body list: (4,4),(5,4)...)\n\u2705 SAFE.\n\n**DOWN to (5,1):**\n- That's OUR NECK \u2014 our body segment (5,1) is right there! \u274c INSTANT DEATH.\n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**\n- Board shows '.' \u2705\n- Not our body.\n- Not enemy body.\n\u2705 SAFE.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,2):**\n- Board shows '.' \u2705\n- Not our body.\n- Not enemy body.\n\u2705 SAFE.\n\nSO UP, LEFT, RIGHT ARE SAFE. DOWN IS SUICIDE.\n\n---\n\nENEMY PREDICTION:\nEnemy head at (4,3). Their safe moves:\n- UP to (4,4): That's their own neck (their body segment (4,4) is right behind head) \u274c\n- DOWN to (4,2): Empty ('.') \u2705\n- LEFT to (3,3): Empty \u2705\n- RIGHT to (5,3): Empty \u2705\n\nThey CAN'T go UP (into their body). They can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?\nIf we go UP to (5,3) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,3) \u2192 SAME CELL \u2192 DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udea8\nIf we go RIGHT to (6,2) and enemy goes ??? No overlap.\nIf we go LEFT to (4,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,2) \u2192 SAME CELL \u2192 DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udea8\n\nSO:\n- UP + enemy RIGHT = collision.\n- LEFT + enemy DOWN = collision.\n- RIGHT seems safe from head-on.\n\nBUT \u2014 WE HAVE 10 APPLES, THEY HAVE 17. IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION, THEY WIN ON SCORE! \ud83d\ude31\nSO WE MUST AVOID HEAD-ON UNLESS WE HAVE MORE APPLES. AVOID UP AND LEFT IF ENEMY MIGHT MOVE INTO US.\n\n---\n\nWHAT'S THE ENEMY LIKELY TO DO?\nTheir body curls around top-left area. They might want to chase apples at (3,2), (2,2), (0,4), (0,7) \u2014 that suggests moving LEFT/DOWN.\nIf they go LEFT to (3,3), they're heading toward apples.\nIf they go DOWN to (4,2), they're moving toward us.\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,3), they're moving toward center/top-right apples.\n\nGiven their high score, they might play safe and avoid us. But they might also try to block us.\n\n---\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS AFTER EACH SAFE MOVE:\n\n**RIGHT to (6,2):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (6,2): UP (6,3) \u2014 empty \u2705, DOWN (6,1) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (5,2) \u2014 empty but our old head position? Wait, our body will be at (5,2)? NO \u2014 our head moves to (6,2), so (5,2) becomes our new neck/body segment. So LEFT to (5,2) is INTO OUR BODY next turn \u274c. RIGHT (7,2) \u2014 empty \u2705.\nOnly 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT). Could get restrictive.\n\n**UP to (5,3):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (5,3): UP (5,4) \u2014 enemy body at (5,4)? YES! Enemy segment (5,4) is there \u274c, DOWN (5,2) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (4,3) \u2014 enemy head currently there, will move, but could be empty next turn? Possibly \u2705, RIGHT (6,3) \u2014 empty \u2705.\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT might be safe \u2014 risky if enemy stays near.\n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (4,2): UP (4,3) \u2014 enemy head now, will move, could be empty \u2705, DOWN (4,1) \u2014 empty \u2705, LEFT (3,2) \u2014 apple there! \u2705, RIGHT (5,2) \u2014 our body \u274c.\nThat's 3 safe moves! Good flexibility, and access to apple at (3,2).\n\n---\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nWe need to close the apple gap. Enemy is longer, so we need to avoid being trapped. Our body forms a wall on right side (cols 6-9). Moving LEFT gets us toward left-side apples ((3,2), (2,2), (0,4)) and keeps options open. RIGHT leads us toward our own body wall \u2014 could get trapped. UP risks head-on and limits next moves.\n\nLEFT looks best: avoids likely head-on (enemy might not go DOWN), gives us 3 next moves, and targets nearest apple at (3,2).\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING LEFT TO STAY AGGRESSIVE BUT SAFE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",
