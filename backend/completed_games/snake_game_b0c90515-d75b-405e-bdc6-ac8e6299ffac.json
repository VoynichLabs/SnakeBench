The head of the enemy snake, Snake #1, is at (7, 3), which means going through that could potentially be hazardous if Snake #1 makes a move in any of those spaces.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\n\nGood thinking! However, moving to the apple at (3, 8) might be dangerous as Snake #1 could move into that area. The placement at (5, 9) is also in a quite vulnerable position for my long, vertical line to fold. I will not take immediate risks but approach cautiously. One safest path is to head towards the apple at (8, 0) while avoiding dangerous moves. If Snake #1 moves into space (7, 3), I could leverage this to get around the board safely. If Snake #1 is threatened by my moves or has limited options, I could use this to my advantage.\n\n**Next move:** LEFT",

Therefore, moving left seems too direct and hazardous.\n\nLet's also consider heading upwards to (1, 8). It doesn't immediately place me at risk from the enemy as it's away from the other snakes and the drywall. However, this area feels tight, and I could be trapped if I'm not careful. I could seek to trap the other snakes by moving up and to the right towards (2, 8).\n\nThe optimal move might be doing a circle to the left-up and then up again, making indirect moves to avoid detection while pushing towards the apple. By minimizing direct head-on movements, I can outmaneuver the enemy while also drawing their attention away from my immediate danger zones.\n\nLooking at a larger strategy, I may plan to form a protective perimeter on the bottom of the board. My next move could be RIGHT to (1, 8), gradually working my way up and to the right, putting me in a buffer zone between the enemy and the apple at (8, 0). In effect, I create a shielded path.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm going to aim for the right to make some progress towards the apple at (6, 9). I've got a clear path in front of me, and I don't see any immediate obstacles.\n\nBut, I should keep an eye out for the enemy snake. If it's moving towards me, I'll need to adjust my strategy quickly to avoid a collision. Let's see where it is... (2, 7) - that's still a bit far away from my current position, but I'll still keep an eye out for any movement.\n\nMy priority is still to get close to the apple, but I also need to be mindful of my own body and make sure I don't run into it. I don't think that's a huge concern right now, given my current position.\n\nI've got a clear path to the right, so I'll just keep moving in that direction. I might consider adjusting my strategy if I notice any danger ahead.\n\nNext move should be a calm and safe one. Let's keep it going!\n\nNEXT MOVE: RIGHT",

I don't want to move too aggressively as this might provoke a valiant response from the enemy.\n\n\nRemaining aware of the enclosed areas, I will initiate a detour towards (2, 7). There, I can avoid engagement and create a pathway potentially leading me to (1, 8) while simultaneously reducing the chance that an enemy will ambush me.\n\n\nSo, the next move should be\n\n**Next move: DOWN (to position myself at (3, 7))**\n\n\nThis move takes me toward the outskirts and allows me to assess the immediate surroundings without drawing attention. If the enemy doesn't pursue, I can slowly advance to (1, 8) en route to the apple at (8, 0). By playing it safe at the beginning, I pave the way for a riskier, more rewarding action later in the game when I can maneuver without the enemy being right on my tail.",
