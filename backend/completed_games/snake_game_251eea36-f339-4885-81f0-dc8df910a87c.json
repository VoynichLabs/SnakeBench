The explanation said moving right next turn is safe after the tail moves.\n\nGoal: reach (8,1) by decreasing y and then adjusting x.\n\nEnemy snake at (0,6) is far, no danger for now.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Next move, moving RIGHT to (8,3) (if safe) since tail will have moved from (8,4).\n\n- Then move DOWN twice to (8,2), then (8,1) to get the apple.\n\nCheck if moving RIGHT now is safe:\n\n- Is (8,3) currently occupied by my body? According to the last info, yes, but after my move down, tail frees (8,4). So (8,3) should be empty.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is safe and moves closer to the apple.\n\nIf move RIGHT now, then in following moves DOWN and get the apple at (8,1).\n\nI should avoid any moves that put me in my own body or enemy.\n\nAlso, keep in mind other apples: (1,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2) \u2014 they are far for now.\n\nSo next optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nStrategy after that:\n\n- Move DOWN twice to get the apple at (8,1).\n\n- Then reconsider path toward other apples.\n\nDecision:\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

No, after eating, the body grows by 1, so the tail won't move this turn.\n\nActually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, the snake grows by not moving the tail that turn, so the body length increases by one.\n\nBefore eating:\n\n- Head: (8,4)\n- Body: [(9,4)]\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (7,4), the head is now (7,4). The body extends by one from the last tail, so now it might be:\n\nBody points: (8,4), (9,4) + previous tail (9,4) repeated?\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nOld body was [(8,4), (9,4)] before last move.\nLast move was LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4).\n\nAfter the move:\n\n- Head at (7,4)\n- Body was previously [(8,4), (9,4)]\n\nSince we ate an apple, the tail stays put for this turn, so the snake length grows by 1. So the new body should be [(8,4), (9,4)], and the new tail position will be the same as previous.\n\nSo current snake positions:\n\nHead: (7,4)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (9,4)]\n\nNow the body is longer by one segment.\n\nOk then.\n\nBoard apples left now:\n\n(8,1), (1,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2)\n\nNow I need to decide next move.\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\nCheck positions around (7,4):\n\n- UP: (7,5) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN: (7,3) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT: (6,4) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT: (8,4) \u2014 my body\n\nLet's avoid moving onto self- body at (8,4).\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck potential risks.\n\nEnemy Snake at (0,8), body [(1,8),(2,8)] \u2014 far away, no immediate danger there.\n\nPlan is to start heading towards apples that are nearby for points.\n\nLet's look at apples:\n\n(8,1) - move towards the bottom right corner\n\n(4,0), and (1,0) - bottom left\n\n(3,2), (4,2) - lower mid-left\n\nFrom (7,4), apples at (4,2) and (3,2) are closer than (8,1).\n\nCalculate Manhattan distances to apples:\n\nTo (4,2): |7-4| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (3,2): |7-3| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nTo (8,1): |7-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTo (4,0): |7-4|+|4-0|=3+4=7\n\nTo (1,0): 6+4=10\n\nSo (8,1) is actually closest apple at distance 4.\n\nOkay, so best to head towards (8,1).\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Can't move RIGHT (body)\n\n- LEFT, UP, DOWN all good.\n\nTo go towards (8,1) from (7,4):\n\n- Need to increase y downwards - need to go DOWN.\n\n- x difference: 8 - 7 = +1, so need to go right eventually, but right is blocked.\n\nSo maybe first move DOWN, then go RIGHT once body advances.\n\nIf I go UP, I move further away from (8,1).\n\nLEFT is moving away from (8,1) since x decreases.\n\nThus my best next move is DOWN.\n\nSummary:\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\n---\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n\nAfter moving down, my body clears position (8,4) as the tail moves forward, so I can move RIGHT afterwards to get closer to (8,1).\n\nKeep an eye on not colliding with myself or the enemy.\n\n---\n\nNext move: DOWN"

So the new body should be [(8,4), (9,4)], and the new tail position will be the same as previous.\n\nSo current snake positions:\n\nHead: (7,4)\n\nBody: [(8,4), (9,4)]\n\nNow the body is longer by one segment.\n\nOk then.\n\nBoard apples left now:\n\n(8,1), (1,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2)\n\nNow I need to decide next move.\n\nFrom (7,4):\n\nCheck positions around (7,4):\n\n- UP: (7,5) \u2014 empty\n- DOWN: (7,3) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT: (6,4) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT: (8,4) \u2014 my body\n\nLet's avoid moving onto self- body at (8,4).\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCheck potential risks.\n\nEnemy Snake at (0,8), body [(1,8),(2,8)] \u2014 far away, no immediate danger there.\n\nPlan is to start heading towards apples that are nearby for points.\n\nLet's look at apples:\n\n(8,1) - move towards the bottom right corner\n\n(4,0), and (1,0) - bottom left\n\n(3,2), (4,2) - lower mid-left\n\nFrom (7,4), apples at (4,2) and (3,2) are closer than (8,1).\n\nCalculate Manhattan distances to apples:\n\nTo (4,2): |7-4| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (3,2): |7-3| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nTo (8,1): |7-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTo (4,0): |7-4|+|4-0|=3+4=7\n\nTo (1,0): 6+4=10\n\nSo (8,1) is actually closest apple at distance 4.\n\nOkay, so best to head towards (8,1).\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Can't move RIGHT (body)\n\n- LEFT, UP, DOWN all good.\n\nTo go towards (8,1) from (7,4):\n\n- Need to increase y downwards - need to go DOWN.\n\n- x difference: 8 - 7 = +1, so need to go right eventually, but right is blocked.\n\nSo maybe first move DOWN, then go RIGHT once body advances.\n\nIf I go UP, I move further away from (8,1).\n\nLEFT is moving away from (8,1) since x decreases.\n\nThus my best next move is DOWN.\n\nSummary:\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\n---\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n\nAfter moving down, my body clears position (8,4) as the tail moves forward, so I can move RIGHT afterwards to get closer to (8,1).\n\nKeep an eye on not colliding with myself or the enemy.\n\n---\n\nNext move: DOWN"
