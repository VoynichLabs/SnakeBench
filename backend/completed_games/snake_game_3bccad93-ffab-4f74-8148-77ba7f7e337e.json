Closest horizontally.\n- Apple (5, 4): 2 x, 4 y distance.\n- Apple (1, 6): 2 x, 6 y distance.\n- Apple (8, 8): 5 x, 8 y distance.\n\nThe apple at (1, 0) is only 2 steps away horizontally, but it's on the same Y level (Y=0).

Moving LEFT puts me in an optimal position to grab it next turn (move LEFT again). Since I am far away from Snake #1 ((8, 4)), and there are no body segments anywhere, self-collision or collision with the enemy head/body is not a concern based on immediate movement/positioning.\n\nI will choose LEFT to head towards (1, 0).\n\nLong term plan: Secure the apple at (1, 0). After that, assess the next closest safe apple. (0, 5) and (1, 6) are good candidates on the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (H=(1, 0))**\n\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    *   Board edges.\n    *   My body: (2, 0). (Cannot move to (2, 0) because that is my tail, and moving directly backwards into the cell immediately behind the head (which is (2,0)) is legal only if it is the only safe move, but this is a two-segment snake so moving to (2, 0) is actually moving onto the tail, which is legal *if the tail moves*. Since the tail moves unless I eat, moving onto the current tail position is usually safe/legal, but since my last move was LEFT (2,0) -> (1,0), moving RIGHT back to (2,0) is moving onto the first segment of my body, which is deadly. Let's re-read the rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since (2, 0) is the segment immediately behind (1, 0), moving RIGHT to (2, 0) is fatal. *Correction: When the snake moves, the tail segment (2, 0) is vacated. However, moving directly backwards is defined as moving onto the segment immediately preceding the tail. Since my length is 2, the segment is (2, 0). Moving (1, 0) -> (2, 0) is moving directly backwards. This is almost always fatal, regardless of length, according to standard snake rules and typically implemented even if the tail is vacated.* **ELIMINATED: RIGHT (1, 0) -> (2, 0)**\n    *   Enemy snake bodies: None.\n    *   Enemy snake heads: $E_1$ (7, 5). Too far for immediate collision.\n\n*   **Candidate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to (1, 1)):** Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to (1, -1)):** Fatal (Off board).\n    *   **LEFT (to (0, 0)):** Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (2, 0)):** **Fatal (Moving backwards into own body segment).**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n---\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves (UP to (1, 1), LEFT to (0, 0))**\n\nI need to target the next nearest apple.\nApples are at: $A_1$(0, 5), $A_2$(5, 4), $A_3$(1, 6), $A_4$(8, 8), $A_5$(6, 5).\n\nDistances (Manhattan) from $H=(1, 0)$:\n1. $A_1$(0, 5): $|1-0| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6$\n2. $A_2$(5, 4): $|1-5| + |0-4| = 4 + 4 = 8$\n3. $A_3$(1, 6): $|1-1| + |0-6| = 0 + 6 = 6$\n\nApples $A_1$(0, 5) and $A_3$(1, 6) are the closest at 6 steps.\n\n*   **Option UP (to (1, 1)):**\n    *   New position: (1, 1).\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): 5 steps (Moves directly towards $A_3$).\n    *   Distance to $A_1$(0, 5): 5 steps.\n    *   This is a strong move, targeting both vertically aligned apples.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to (0, 0)):**\n    *   New position: (0, 0).\n    *   Distance to $A_1$(0, 5): 5 steps (Moves directly towards $A_1$).\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): $|0-1| + |0-6| = 1 + 6 = 7$ steps (Moves away from $A_3$).\n\n**Comparison:**\nBoth moves reduce the distance to the closest apples (A1 and A3) to 5 steps.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 1): I am centrally positioned horizontally relative to $A_3$, and only 1 step away from $A_1$'s X-coordinate. I can continue UP to reach $A_3$ in 5 moves (1, 1) -> (1, 6).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 0): I am perfectly positioned horizontally for $A_1$. I can continue UP to reach $A_1$ in 5 moves (0, 0) -> (0, 5).\n\nSince I am targeting two apples on the left side of the board ($A_1$ and $A_3$), either UP or LEFT is acceptable. Moving UP keeps me on the X=1 column, which is an immediate straight path to $A_3$(1, 6) and allows flexibility. Moving LEFT commits me to the X=0 column, which is a straight path to $A_1$(0, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize $A_3$(1, 6) as it is directly vertically aligned after the move UP.\n\n---\n**3. Enemy Analysis (E1 at (7, 5))**\n\n$E_1$ is far away. Its closest apples are $A_5$(6, 5) (1 step) and $A_2$(5, 4) (3 steps).\n$E_1$ will almost certainly move towards $A_5$(6, 5) (LEFT or DOWN).\nIf $E_1$ moves LEFT to (6, 5), it eats the apple.\nIf $E_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 4), it delays the apple but aims for $A_2$.\n\nMy movements on the left side (X=0 or X=1) are entirely safe from $E_1$.\n\n---\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nMoving UP to (1, 1) sets me on a clear, long path toward $A_3$(1, 6) while still being close to $A_1$(0, 5). This seems slightly more flexible than hugging the wall at X=0 immediately.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP towards (1, 6). We should reach (1, 6) in the next 5 turns if we keep moving UP, and then we can evaluate if we should drop down to (0, 5) or move across for the central apples.\n\nUP",

If they move LEFT to (7, 5), they are 1 step from $A_5$. If they move LEFT, LEFT, they reach (6, 5) and eat the apple.\n\nIf $E_1$ moves LEFT (to (7, 5)) this turn, it is 6 steps away from me. No immediate collision risk.\n\n---\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (H=(1, 1))**\n\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    *   Board edges.\n    *   My body: (1, 0).\n    *   Enemy snake heads/bodies: $E_1$ (8, 5) is distant.\n\n*   **Candidate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to (1, 2)):** Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to (1, 0)):** Fatal (Moving backwards into own body segment, even though it will be the tail and vacate). Length 2 snakes are especially vulnerable to this rule. **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   **LEFT (to (0, 1)):** Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (to (2, 1)):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves relative to Target Apples**\n\nI am aiming for $A_3$(1, 6) (X=1) and $A_1$(0, 5) (X=0).\n\nDistances (Manhattan) from $H=(1, 1)$:\n1. $A_3$(1, 6): $0 + 5 = 5$ steps.\n2. $A_1$(0, 5): $1 + 4 = 5$ steps.\n3. $A_2$(5, 4): $4 + 3 = 7$ steps.\n\n*   **Option UP (to (1, 2)):**\n    *   New position (1, 2).\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): 4 steps. (Direct path, optimal for $A_3$).\n    *   Distance to $A_1$(0, 5): 5 steps.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (to (0, 1)):**\n    *   New position (0, 1).\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): $|0-1| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6$ steps. (Worse for $A_3$).\n    *   Distance to $A_1$(0, 5): $|0-0| + |1-5| = 4$ steps. (Direct path, optimal for $A_1$).\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (to (2, 1)):**\n    *   New position (2, 1).\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): 5 steps. (1 step away from X=1 column).\n    *   Distance to $A_1$(0, 5): $|2-0| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6$ steps. (Worse for $A_1$ and $A_3$).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP targets $A_3$(1, 6) in 4 moves, keeping me on the optimal X column.\nMoving LEFT targets $A_1$(0, 5) in 4 moves.\n\nBoth targets are equally close (4 moves). $A_3$ (1, 6) is higher up the board, which might give me better board control quickly. Let's maintain the vertical ascent towards (1, 6) as planned in the previous turn.\n\nIf I move UP, I will be at (1, 2). The path to (1, 6) remains straight UP. This maximizes efficiency towards $A_3$.\n\n**Long-term plan note:** Continue moving UP for the next 4 turns to eat apple $A_3$ at (1, 6). After eating $A_3$, evaluate pursuing $A_1$(0, 5) or turning right toward the board center ($A_2$ or $A_5$, assuming $E_1$ misses or $A_5$ is still there).\n\nUP",

This is a good alternative, targeting $A_1$.\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (to (2, 4)):**\n    *   Distance to $A_3$(1, 6): 3 steps. Not optimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMoving UP to (1, 5) positions me perfectly to eat $A_3$(1, 6) in the next turn (Turn 7). This apple $A_3$ is currently the fastest and safest target.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 4), I would also be 1 step away from $A_1$(0, 5). However, $A_3$(1, 6) is one step further away than $A_1$(0, 5) was from my previous position (1, 4). Since I committed to $A_3$ last turn, continuing the straight vertical path is marginally cleaner and gets me away from the bottom of the board faster.\n\nTherefore, **UP** is the best move.\n\n**Long-term plan note (Next 2 turns):** Move UP to eat $A_3$(1, 6) next turn (T7). After eating $A_3$, turn LEFT and then DOWN to target $A_1$(0, 5).\n\nUP",

Based on the current display, $E_1$ is at (8, 5).)\n*   Body: None (Length 1)\n*   Apples collected: 0\n\nApple locations $A$: $A_1$(0, 5), $A_2$(5, 4), $A_3$(1, 6), $A_4$(8, 8), $A_5$(6, 5).\n\n---\n**1.

I am adjacent to two apples:\n1.  $A_1$: (0, 5) - 1 step LEFT.\n2.  $A_3$: (1, 6) - 1 step UP.\n\nNeither apple is contested by Snake 1, which is far away at (8, 5).\n\nSince my current path has been vertical, moving UP to $A_3$(1, 6) is the most immediate continuation of the planned movement.\n\n---\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (H=(1, 5))**\n\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    *   Board edges (0-9).\n    *   My body: (1, 4).\n    *   Enemy snake head/bodies: $E_1$ (8, 5) is distant.\n\n*   **Candidate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to (1, 6)):** Safe. Lands on $A_3$. **EAT APPLE.**\n    *   **DOWN (to (1, 4)):** Fatal (Moving backwards into own body segment, which becomes the tail this turn). **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   **LEFT (to (0, 5)):** Safe. Lands on $A_1$. **EAT APPLE.**\n    *   **RIGHT (to (2, 5)):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves that eat an apple: UP, LEFT.\n\n---\n**3. Choose Best Eating Move**\n\nBoth UP ($A_3$) and LEFT ($A_1$) are equally viable in terms of immediate safety and reward.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 6):\n*   Next turn: I will be at (1, 6), size 3 (T=(1, 4)).\n*   $A_1$(0, 5) will be 2 steps away (LEFT, DOWN).\n*   $A_5$(6, 5) will be 5 steps away.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 5):\n*   Next turn: I will be at (0, 5), size 3 (T=(1, 4)).\n*   $A_3$(1, 6) will be 2 steps away (RIGHT, UP).\n\nThe difference is minor. Moving UP maintains the vertical trajectory, getting the snake higher up the board. This often offers more maneuvering room later, though in this case, (0, 5) is equally open. Given my previous rationale targeted $A_3$(1, 6) by moving UP last turn, maintaining that committed target is reasonable.\n\nI choose **UP** to eat the apple at (1, 6).\n\n---\n**4. Enemy Snake #1 Analysis (E1 at 8, 5)**\n\n$E_1$ is at (8, 5).\nClosest apples to $E_1$:\n1. $A_5$(6, 5): 2 steps (LEFT x 2).\n2. $A_4$(8, 8): 3 steps (UP x 3).\n3. $A_2$(5, 4): 4 steps (LEFT x 3, DOWN x 1).\n\n$E_1$ is highly likely to move LEFT towards $A_5$(6, 5) or UP towards $A_4$(8, 8). This does not affect my move.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will eat $A_3$(1, 6) this turn (T7). Next turn, I will be at (1, 6). I will then move LEFT to (0, 6) and then DOWN to (0, 5) to claim $A_1$, or move directly towards $A_5$(6, 5). $A_1$ (0, 5) is the planned immediate follow-up.\n\nUP",

Moves toward the open center/top left.\n*   **DOWN (to (1, 5)):** Fatal. Moving directly into own body segment (the cell immediately behind the head). **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 6)):** Safe. Gets closer to A1 (0, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 6)):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n\nAll legal moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are not blocked by the enemy E1, which is at (8, 6).\n\n**4. Choosing the Best Move**\n\nWe want to move towards $A_1$ (0, 5).\n\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 6)):** This is the direct path toward $A_1$. From (0, 6), the next step is DOWN to (0, 5), eating $A_1$. This secures a third apple quickly.\n\n*   **UP (to (1, 7)):** This is safe but moves further away from the nearest unsecured apple $A_1$.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 6)):** This is safe but moves further away from $A_1$. It moves in a direction that might eventually challenge E1 for the central apples ($A_4, A_5$), but E1 is much closer to those. Snake 1 might move LEFT to (7, 6) or (7, 5) to target $A_4$ or $A_5$. If E1 moves LEFT, moving RIGHT might lead to a race later. Sticking to the immediate cluster of apples (0, 5) is safer.\n\nThe optimal strategy is securing the immediate, uncontested apple $A_1$.\n\nDecision: **LEFT** to (0, 6).\n\n**5. Enemy Prediction (E1 at 8, 6)**\n\nE1 is adjacent to $A_5$ (6, 6) (2 steps: LEFT x 2) and $A_3$ (8, 8) (2 steps: UP x 2).\nIt is also 1 step away from $A_4$'s vertical line (7, 6) if it moves left.\n*   E1 will likely move UP to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 6). Both moves lead toward apples.\n*   If E1 moves UP: It targets A3 (8, 8).\n*   If E1 moves LEFT: It targets A5 (6, 6).\n\nThis prediction does not influence my decision to move LEFT toward A1 (0, 5).\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 6) (Turn 8). Then move DOWN to (0, 5) (Turn 9) to consume $A_1$. After that, potentially move toward the central apples $A_4, A_5$.\n\nLEFT",

E1 moved **UP**. It seems to be aiming for $A_2$ (8, 8) or perhaps $A_4$ (6, 6) or $A_3$ (6, 5) via the top edge.\n\n**2. Immediate Goal and Next Apple Target**\n\nOur snake is now positioned on the left edge, Head at (0, 5). We have successfully claimed the apple in this corner.\n\nThe remaining apples:\n1. (0, 0) - Distance: 5 (Directly DOWN).\n2. (5, 4) - Distance: 5 (Right/Down).\n3. (6, 5) - Distance: 6 (Right).\n4. (6, 6) - Distance: 7 (Right/Up).\n5. (8, 8) - Distance: 11 (Far).\n\nThe closest apples are $A_5$ (0, 0) and $A_1$ (5, 4). Since we are currently near the left wall, moving down to (0, 0) is a relatively straightforward path, but it forces us into a non-ideal corner position.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we open up the board toward the major cluster of apples (5, 4), (6, 5), and (6, 6) before E1 can secure them.\n\n*   Current plan from $H = (0, 5)$: Move away from the wall and toward the center.\n\n**3. Safety and Move Evaluation (H=(0, 5))**\n\n*   **Obstacles:** Own body $B$=[(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5)], Board edges, E1 (7, 7).\n\n*   **UP (to (0, 6)):** Fatal. Moving into the first segment of own body. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **DOWN (to (0, 4)):** Safe. Moves toward (0, 0) apple. Path length calculation suggests 4 more moves to eat it.\n*   **LEFT (to (-1, 5)):** Fatal. Off the board edge (x < 0). **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 5)):** Fatal. Moving into the last segment (tail) of own body. **ELIMINATED.**\n\nWait, let's re-examine the body state.\nHead: (0, 5)\nBody: (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5) -- Note: When the snake eats, the tail segment (1, 5) is preserved, since the movement was from (0, 6) to (0, 5).\n\n$H = (0, 5)$.\n1. UP to (0, 6): Hits B[0]. **DEAD.**\n2. DOWN to (0, 4): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (-1, 5): Off board. **DEAD.**\n4. RIGHT to (1, 5): Hits B[3] (old tail). **DEAD.**\n\nThis is a critical trapping situation due to the L-shape of the body right off the head. The only safe move is DOWN.\n\n**4. Executing the Move DOWN**\n\nSince only DOWN is safe, we must take it. This path moves us toward the apple at (0, 0).\n\n$H' = (0, 4)$.\nIf we move DOWN, the new body will be: $B'$ = [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)]. The old tail (1, 5) is removed.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Update**\n\nThe immediate lock on the Head due to the body shape forces us to stay on the left edge for now.\n$H$ will be at (0, 4) next turn. We will have to continue DOWN until (0, 0), then move RIGHT.\n\n*   T10: DOWN (to (0, 4))\n*   T11: DOWN (to (0, 3))\n*   T12: DOWN (to (0, 2))\n*   T13: DOWN (to (0, 1))\n*   T14: DOWN (to (0, 0) - Eat Apple)\n\nMeanwhile, E1 is at (7, 7) and may target the central cluster (6, 5) or (6, 6), or the far apple (8, 8). We are currently too far away to contest those. Securing (0, 0) is now the priority.\n\nDOWN",

Immediate Goal and Target Apple**\n\nOur snake is safely on the left edge at (0, 4). Based on the forced move last turn, the highest priority is securing the apple at (0, 0) before moving into the open board.\n\nDistance to (0, 0): 4 moves (all DOWN).\n\n**3.

Off the board edge (x < 0). **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 4)):** Safe. Moves toward the center, but away from the closest apple (0, 0).\n\n**4. Strategic Choice**\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **DOWN (to (0, 3)):** This maintains the dedicated route to the guaranteed apple (0, 0). It is a highly efficient path. Our subsequent moves will be confined to the left edge for 3 more turns, but this secures a point.\n2.  **RIGHT (to (1, 4)):** This opens up the board immediately. However, the path to the next closest center apple (5, 4) is 4 moves (e.g., R, R, R, R, D or R, R, R, D, R). If we move RIGHT, we leave the (0, 0) apple vulnerable/available for later if E1 somehow makes it all the way across. More immediately, moving RIGHT now might complicate accessing (0, 0) later, potentially trapping us between the wall and our long body once it expands.\n\nGiven the initial tight situation that forced us to the wall, continuing the planned lock-in to claim (0, 0) is the most prudent and predictable strategy. E1 is far away and doesn't pose an immediate threat to (0, 0).\n\nWe choose DOWN.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan for Future Self (T12+)**\n\nWe are following the plan established in the previous turn. We will continue moving DOWN until we eat the apple at (0, 0).\n\n*   T11: H -> (0, 3). Move: DOWN.\n*   T12: H -> (0, 2). Move: DOWN.\n*   T13: H -> (0, 1). Move: DOWN.\n*   T14: H -> (0, 0).

Safety and Move Evaluation (H=(1, 1))**\n\n*   **Own Body Check:**\n    *   The segment directly behind the head is (1, 0).\n    *   Other body segments: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3).\n    *   Tail T is currently at (0, 3). Since no apple was eaten last turn, the tail (0, 3) will vacate to (0, 4) next turn. **Correction:** The tail **remains** at (0, 3) because it shifts to where (0, 2) was, and (0, 2) shifts to where (0, 1) was, and so on, unless an apple was eaten. If no apple was eaten, (0, 3) will be the free cell after the turn.\n\n*   **Boundaries Check:** Safe.\n\n*   **Enemy Check:** E1 is far away. No immediate conflict.\n\n*   **UP (to (1, 2)):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 4).\n*   **DOWN (to (1, 0)):** Fatal. Moving directly into the first segment of own body. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **LEFT (to (0, 1)):** Fatal. Moving into the body segment (0, 1). **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **RIGHT (to (2, 1)):** Safe. Deviates from the target apple (1, 4).\n\n**3. Strategic Choice**\n\nThe primary goal is to reach the apple at (1, 4) quickly. Moving UP maintains the trajectory planned in the previous turn.\n\n*   H=(1, 1) -> UP -> (1, 2). This is safe and optimal for collecting the apple at (1, 4) in the next two turns.\n*   Moving RIGHT (2, 1) is safe but delays apple collection and forces a pathfinding decision later.\n\n**4.

Move: UP (Collects apple, Length 7).\n\nAfter collecting the apple, the snake should aim towards the central cluster, prioritizing (5, 4) or (6, 5).\n\nPlan for Next Few Turns:\nT17: UP to (1, 2).
