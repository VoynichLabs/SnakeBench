X needs to decrease, Y needs to decrease.\n\n*   **LEFT (7, 7):** Moves closer to X=6. Distance to (6, 5) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ~ 2.24. This is the best immediate directional move towards (6, 5).\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** Moves closer to Y=5. Distance to (6, 5) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5) ~ 2.24.\n*   **UP (8, 8):** Increases distance from Y=5. Distance to (6, 5) = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13). Bad.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Increases distance from X=6. Distance to (6, 5) = sqrt(9 + 4) = sqrt(13). Bad.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN move me equally closer to (6, 5). Let's see if one sets up a better next turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7): Next turn I can move LEFT to (6, 7) or DOWN to (7, 6).\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 6): Next turn I can move LEFT to (7, 6) or DOWN to (8, 5).\n\nSince I want to reduce both X and Y towards (6, 5), let's look at the intermediate coordinates.\n\nIf I choose LEFT: (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5) (4 turns assuming straight movement)\nIf I choose DOWN: (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5) (4 turns assuming straight movement)\n\nBoth seem equally viable in terms of pathing to A1 (6, 5).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy head (8, 7). Enemy head (4, 9). We are far apart. There is no risk of immediate head-on collision or moving into each other's starting positions.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose LEFT to move towards the center of the board and simultaneously reduce the X coordinate towards the target apple (6, 5). The resulting position (7, 7) provides good flexibility for the next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe).\n\nLong-term plan: Aim for (6, 5).\n\nLEFT",

Distance becomes 2 + 1 = 3.\nA move of **DOWN** (6, 4) reduces the Y gap by 1 and maintains the X gap. Distance becomes 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nMoving RIGHT (7, 5) is the most efficient single move towards (9, 4).\n\n**4. Check Enemy Threat**\n\nEnemy Snake 1 is at (3, 6). The enemy is currently far from (9, 4). They are likely prioritizing (0, 5) or (3, 1) or perhaps (5, 1).\n\n*   Distance from (3, 6) to (9, 4): $|3-9| + |6-4| = 6 + 2 = 8$. (Low likelihood they target this one now).\n*   Distance from (3, 6) to (0, 5): $|3-0| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (High priority for them).\n*   Distance from (3, 6) to (5, 1): $|3-5| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7$.\n*   Distance from (3, 6) to (3, 1): $|3-3| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5$.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake 1 will move towards (0, 5), probably LEFT (2, 6) or DOWN (3, 5). Regardless of their move, a move to (7, 5) keeps me safe and moving towards my target. There is no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**5. Final Move Selection:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 5) to efficiently pursue the apple at (9, 4).\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan (T5 onwards):**\nIf I move RIGHT (7, 5), my body will be (6, 5).\nIf I aim for (9, 4):\nT4: RIGHT (7, 5)\nT5: Maybe RIGHT (8, 5) or DOWN (7, 4). (7, 4) gets me closer.\nT6: Move to (8, 4) or (7, 4). Wait, (9, 4) is the target.\nT4: RIGHT (7, 5)\nT5: RIGHT (8, 5)\nT6: RIGHT (9, 5)\nT7: DOWN (9, 4) (Eat)\nThis path takes 4 moves.

Path: D, R, R (3 moves).\n*   Move RIGHT (8, 5): Next step: (9, 5). Then DOWN to eat. Path: R, R, D (3 moves).\n\nBoth paths take 3 moves. Let's look at the current position relative to the board boundaries and enemy.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 5). It is likely aiming for (0, 5), (5, 1), or (3, 1).\nIf Snake 1 moves:\n*   LEFT (2, 5): Closer to (0, 5). M-dist 5.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): Closer to (3, 1). M-dist 4.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): Not immediately useful. M-dist 6 to (0, 5).\n\nThe enemy is far away and does not pose an immediate blocking threat to the (9, 4) apple.\n\nChoosing RIGHT (8, 5) keeps me higher on the board until the final move, which might feel slightly safer, but moving DOWN (7, 4) positions me on the same Y-level as the target (9, 4) faster. Since (9, 4) is below (7, 5), moving DOWN first (7, 4) seems slightly more direct in terms of path shape, allowing me to run along Y=4 for the final segments.\n\nLet's review the sequences for precision:\n1. Move DOWN (7, 4). Next possible move is RIGHT (to 8, 4). Then RIGHT (to 9, 4 - eat).\n2. Move RIGHT (8, 5). Next possible move is RIGHT (to 9, 5). Then DOWN (to 9, 4 - eat).\n\nBoth are good. I will choose **RIGHT** (8, 5) because it immediately maximizes the X component, getting me closer to the edge where the apple is located, and the subsequent path (R, D) is straightforward.\n\n**4. Check for Future Traps/Safety**\nMoving to (8, 5) keeps me along the top half of the board edge, which is generally open. No immediate trapping risks.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T6 onwards):**\nTarget (9, 4).\nT5: Move RIGHT (to 8, 5). Body is (7, 5).\nT6: Move RIGHT (to 9, 5). Body is (8, 5).\nT7: Move DOWN (to 9, 4 - EAT). Body is (9, 5). Apple count 2. Length 3.\nThis seems optimal for capturing (9, 4). I estimate I will eat it on Turn 7.\n\nRIGHT",

Excellent: sets up immediate capture next turn. |\n\nUP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**3. Strategy Decision: Target (9, 4)**\n\nI am 2 moves away. The planned sequence was R, R, D.\nT5: (7, 5) -> (8, 5) [RIGHT]\nT6: (8, 5) -> (9, 5) [RIGHT]\nT7: (9, 5) -> (9, 4) [DOWN] (EAT)\n\nLet's check alternative moves:\nIf I move DOWN (8, 4): M-dist to (9, 4) is 1. Next move must be RIGHT (9, 4 - EAT). This is also a 2-move sequence: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWhich move is better: RIGHT to (9, 5) or DOWN to (8, 4)?\nBoth sequences guarantee the apple on T7, provided no collision.\nThe enemy is at (2, 5).\n\nEnemy 1 target analysis: Snake 1 is at (2, 5), aiming for (0, 5) (M=2), (3, 1) (M=5), or (5, 1) (M=6). It is very likely moving LEFT towards (0, 5) or DOWN/RIGHT toward (3, 1) or (5, 1).\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT to (1, 5) or (0, 5), it is completely unrelated to my maneuver on the right edge.\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (3, 5), it is still very far away.\n\nSince both RIGHT and DOWN lead to capture in 2 turns:\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 5). Next turn: Move DOWN to (9, 4).\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 4). Next turn: Move RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT (9, 5) places my head against the right border. This is a very secure position to take the apple the following turn. I will stick to the planned sequence.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan Update (T7 onwards):**\nT6: Move RIGHT (to 9, 5). Body is (8, 5).\nT7: Move DOWN (to 9, 4 - EAT). Body is (9, 5). Apple count 2. Length 3.\nNew target calculation after T7 capture. Remaining apples: (5, 1), (0, 5), (3, 1), (0, 0).\n\nThe priority will likely shift to (5, 1) or (3, 1) if they are still available and relatively safe, or perhaps (0, 5) if the enemy snake moves away from it.\n\nRIGHT",

Calculate Distances to Remaining Apples from My Head (9, 3):**\n*   (9, 1): $|9-9| + |3-1| = 2$ (The primary target)\n*   (8, 0): $|9-8| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4$\n*   (5, 1): $|9-5| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6$\n*   (3, 1): $|9-3| + |3-1| = 6 + 2 = 8$\n*   (0, 0): $|9-0| + |3-0| = 9 + 3 = 12$\n\nThe target (9, 1) is now only 2 moves away.\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake 1 Position and Strategy:**\nEnemy Head is at (0, 4). It has three segments: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5).\nNearest apples for Snake 1:\n*   (0, 0): M=4 (via DOWN)\n*   (3, 1): M=6\n*   (5, 1): M=8\n*   (8, 0): M=12\n\nSnake 1 is clearly positioned to move DOWN again towards (0, 0). If it moves DOWN, its new head will be (0, 3).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves from (9, 3):**\nMy body segments are (9, 4) and (9, 5).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Safety Check (Wall/Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head) | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (9, 4) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (9, 4)) | SAFE | Moving directly backwards. |\n| DOWN | (9, 2) | SAFE | SAFE | Targets (9, 1). Distance 1 remaining. |\n| LEFT | (8, 3) | SAFE | SAFE | Moves towards (8, 0). Distance 4 remained if I switch target. |\n| RIGHT | (10, 3) | **FATAL** (Off board) | N/A | Wall collision. |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**4. Strategic Move Selection:**\n\nI am on course to capture (9, 1) in 2 moves (T9 and T10). This involves moving DOWN twice.\n\nIf I choose DOWN now:\nT9: DOWN to (9, 2). Distance to (9, 1) is 1.\nT10: DOWN to (9, 1). EAT.\n\nThis is the fastest objective, and it is completely unthreatened by Snake 1.\n\nIf I choose LEFT now:\nT9: LEFT to (8, 3). Distance to (8, 0) is 3 (D, D, D). Total 4 moves counting T9. This is slower than capturing (9, 1). I would only take LEFT if DOWN were dangerous, which it is not.\n\nI confirm the move **DOWN**.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan Update (T10 onwards):**\nT9: Move DOWN (to 9, 2).\nT10: Move DOWN (to 9, 1 - EAT). Length 4. Apple count 3.\n\nAfter T10, I will be at (9, 1). The next closest apple is (8, 0) (M=1).\nT11: Move LEFT (to 8, 1).\nT12: Move DOWN (to 8, 0 - EAT). Length 5. Apple count 4.\n\nAt T12, I will be at (8, 0). Snake 1 will likely have caught (0, 0) by T13/T14, or perhaps sooner if my distance calculations are slightly off for them. My capture rate is currently excellent. My next target after (8, 0) would be (5, 1) (M=4) or (3, 1) (M=6).\n\nDOWN",

Strategic Move Selection:**\nMove DOWN to (8, 0). This secures the 4th apple and advances my score lead.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan Update (T13 onwards):**\nT12: Move DOWN (to 8, 0 - EAT). Length 5. Apple count 4.\n\nAfter T12, I will be at (8, 0).\nNext closest apples: (5, 1) (M=3) or (3, 1) (M=5).\nI will focus on (5, 1) first.\nT13: Move LEFT (to 7, 0).\nT14: Move LEFT (to 6, 0).\nT15: Move (UP/LEFT) towards (5, 1). If I move UP from (6, 0) to (6, 1), I am 1 move away from (5, 1). This is competitive with Snake 1, who may be focusing on (3, 1).\n\nSnake 1's probable movement: Snake 1 will likely move DOWN to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 2) to continue towards (0, 0) or (3, 1). If they move consistently, they will capture (0, 0) in T14 (e.g., (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0)). I need to ensure I maintain pace on the right side.\n\nPlan for next turns: Head West along the bottom edge, then pivot up to capture (5, 1).\n\nDOWN",

It's now positioned well for (3, 1) (M=1) or (0, 0) (M=2) or (5, 1) (M=3).\nSince (3, 1) is an immediate threat to Snake 1, I must assume Snake 1 will attempt to take (3, 1) this turn.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves:\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1): EATS apple.

My body is [(7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. Path L, U, L: (6, 0) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1). This is a 3-move path.\nIf I go UP (7, 1). My body is [(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. Path U, L, L: (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1). This is also a 3-move path.\n\nIf Snake 1 goes toward (3, 1) (i.e., RIGHT to (3, 1) and eats), then they are at (3, 1) / Length 4.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 0), Snake 1 is far away.\nIf I move UP to (7, 1), Snake 1 is far away.\n\nGiven that Snake 1 is aiming for (3, 1), securing (5, 1) via the safest route seems best. If I choose LEFT repeatedly, I run along the bottom edge. If I choose UP now, I get into the middle, which can be useful for future apples (9, 8), or (5, 9).\n\nLet's stick to the previously planned local path which suggested LEFT (to 6, 0) for the next step towards (5, 1).\n\n**T14 Plan Execution Check (LEFT):**\nNew position: (6, 0).\nNext turn (T15): I can move UP to (6, 1).

Since getting off the wall slightly earlier sometimes helps maneuvering, let's look at UP:\n\nT14: UP to (7, 1).\nBody blocks: (8, 0) is now the 2nd segment, (8, 1) the 3rd.\nT15: Move LEFT to (6, 1). Safe.\nT16: Move LEFT to (5, 1). EAT.\n\nIf I go UP, I don't interfere with potential rightward travel of my body segments (which are near x=8, x=9).\n\nIf Snake 1 takes (3, 1) (which is likely):\nT14: S1 -> (3, 1) [EAT]. S0 -> (7, 1).\n\nNow S1 is at (3, 1). They might target (5, 1) or (0, 0).\nS1 Path to (5, 1): M=2 (R, U, or R, R).

S1 must go R, U, or maybe R, R, or D, L.\nTargeting (5, 1) is critical for S1. Path R, U is minimal (M=2).\nS1 R: (4, 1).\nS0 L: (6, 1).\n\nT16 analysis:\nS1 needs to move to (5, 1). This is dangerous.\n\nLet's re-examine the LEFT move (S0 to 6, 0):\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 1) (EAT) on T14.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 0) on T14.\n\nT15 analysis:\nS1 is at (3, 1). S1 must move R: (4, 1).\nS0 move UP: (6, 1).\n\nT16 analysis:\nS1 is at (4, 1). S1 moves R: (5, 1).\nS0 is at (6, 1). S0 moves L: (5, 1).\n**Head-on collision at (5, 1)!** Both paths are equally fast (3 moves, eating on T16).\n\nIf I cannot guarantee reaching (5, 1) safely, I must choose a different apple or a defensive/slower path.\n\nIf I move slowly, I let S1 take (5, 1).\n\nWhat if I aim for (0, 0)? M=7. Too far.\nWhat if I aim for (9, 8)? M=9. Too far.\n\nI must assume S1 will claim (3, 1) and attempt to claim (5, 1).\n\nIf Snake 1 moves to (3, 1) (EAT) on T14, then it is at (3, 1).\nIf a collision is expected on T16, I must delay by one turn or go for a different target.\n\nDelaying S0 by one turn:\nT14: Move LEFT (6, 0).\nT15: Move LEFT (5, 0).\nT16: Move UP (5, 1). EAT.\nLength of path is 3. Still T16 EAT. This doesn't help.\n\nI need a 4-turn path to (5, 1) to avoid the T16 collision if S1 takes (3, 1).\n\nPath L, L, U: (7, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (5, 1).

This is M=2.\n\nMy path to (5, 1) from (7, 0) is M=3.\nIf S1 eats at T14, S1 reaches (5, 1) at T16.\nIf I reach (5, 1) at T16, we collide.\n\nMy current analysis suggests I lose this race if S1 prioritizes (5, 1) right after (3, 1).\nS1 total moves: (2, 1) -> (3, 1) [A] -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) [A]. Total 3 moves for S1 to capture two apples.\n\nI need to re-evaluate the distance calculation.\nID 0 current location: (7, 0).\nID 1 current location: (2, 1).\n\nIf Snake 1 picks (3, 1) (M=1), then they gain an apple and are at (3, 1) on T14.\nFrom (3, 1), the distance to (5, 1) is 2 (R, R or R, U followed by L, not optimal). R, R is (4, 1), (5, 1). M=2.\nS1 reaches (5, 1) in T16.\n\nMy distance to (5, 1) is 3. M=3.\nI reach (5, 1) in T17.\n\nExample S0 path (M=3):\nT14: L to (6, 0).\nT15: L to (5, 0).\nT16: U to (5, 1). EAT.\n\nWait, my distance calculation was wrong above.\n(7, 0) to (5, 1): x distance 2, y distance 1. Total Manhattan distance: 3. Yes, M=3.\nL, L, U = (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1).\nIf S1 is faster, I must avoid the collision and find another target.\n\nIf S1 takes (3, 1) and (5, 1): ID 1 4 apples. ID 0 4 apples. Tightens the race significantly. I need to go North for the high apples (9, 8) or (5, 9).\n\n(7, 0) to (5, 9): M=2+9=11.\n(7, 0) to (9, 8): M=2+8=10.\n\nSince the lower apples seem mostly ceded to Snake 1 now, let's start moving north/east towards the higher score apples. (9, 8) is slightly closer.\n(7, 0) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 2) ...\n\nIf I move UP: (7, 1). This is the start of the northern path.\nIf I move LEFT: (6, 0). This is still progressing towards the old targets.\n\nSince my current head position (7, 0) is only 1 move away from my body segment (8, 0), moving right is death. Moving down is death. Only UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 0), I am still moving away from the body/wall structure, but I commit two more turns to the bottom half, which S1 is likely to control now.\nIf I move UP to (7, 1), I start the move towards (9, 8).\n\nLet's prioritize the move that initiates the long haul toward higher apples, thus giving up the contested (5, 1).\n\nTarget: (9, 8). Path M=10.\nT14: UP to (7, 1).\nT15: UP to (7, 2).\n...\n\nThis requires 8 moves UP and 2 moves RIGHT. Total 10 moves. Safely on board, moves away from S1.\n\nIf S1 moves to (3, 1) [Eat] on T14. Snake 1 is still far from (9, 8) or (5, 9). Snake 1 will likely move to (5, 1) on T15/T16.\n\nMove UP to secure the long-term viable target.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check (7, 0) -> (7, 1):**\n1. No wall hit.\n2. No own body hit. My body is [(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. (7, 1) is safe.\n3. No enemy head collision. S1 is at (2, 1). They are far away.\n\nUP to (7, 1) is the strategic move to pivot targets and avoid conflict.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Rationale:**\nSnake 1 is positioned to take both (3, 1) and (5, 1). Since ID 0 is 1 move slower to (5, 1) than S1 is from (3, 1), I must assume S1 takes both, increasing their score significantly but positioning them poorly for the high-y apples. I will now pivot to target (9, 8) (M=10) or (5, 9) (M=11). Moving UP to (7, 1) starts this path.\n\nT14: UP (7, 1)\nT15: UP (7, 2)\nT16: UP (7, 3)\nT17: UP (7, 4)\nT18: UP (7, 5)\nT19: UP (7, 6)\nT20: UP (7, 7)\nT21: UP (7, 8)\nT22: R (8, 8)\nT23: R (9, 8) - EAT.\n\nThis is a feasible, albeit long, plan that avoids immediate conflict.\n\nUP",

(Note: The body listed in the prompt reflects the state *after* the previous move (UP from (7, 0) to (7, 1)), where the tail (9, 1) or (9, 2) became (9, 1) and the old head (7, 0) became the first body segment).\nApples: (5, 1), (0, 0), (9, 8), (5, 9), (9, 6).\n\nEnemy Snake #1: Head (3, 1). Length: 4 (since it likely ate (3, 1) last turn). Apples: 3.\nBody: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)]. (If S1 ate (3, 1), its new body is (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2). If it didn't eat, its body would be [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), original tail]). Assuming it ate (3, 1) since it was 1 move away and strategically vital.\n\n*Assumption Check: S1 moved RIGHT from (2, 1) to (3, 1) and ate the apple.*\n*S1 New State: Head (3, 1), Length 4, Body [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)].*\n\n**Strategic Objectives**\nBased on the previous rationale, I assumed Snake 1 would claim (3, 1) (which it has now done) and then target (5, 1). Since my path to (5, 1) was longer (M=3) than S1's path from (3, 1) (M=2), I decided to pivot North towards (9, 8) and (5, 9).\n\nMy current position is (7, 1). Goal: (9, 8) (M=9) or (5, 9) (M=10).\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 1)**\nBody segments: (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Safety Check (Wall/Body) | Progress Towards (9, 8) | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 2) | SAFE | +1 Y | Good (Directly north) |\n| DOWN | (7, 0) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (7, 0) - backwards move) | - | Kill |\n| LEFT | (6, 1) | SAFE | Neutral/Slightly worse (M=9 still, but further from X=9) | Sub-optimal |\n| RIGHT | (8, 1) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (8, 1)) | - | Kill |\n\nOnly UP and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Pathing Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 7, 2):**\n    This continues the northern pivot towards (9, 8).\n    Remaining path M=8 (6 UP, 2 RIGHT). Targets T23 eat. This is the optimal start for the long-haul target (9, 8).\n\n2.  **Move LEFT (to 6, 1):**\n    This move brings me closer to (5, 1) (M=1 away).\n    Path to (5, 1) from (6, 1): L (5, 1) [Eat]. M=1.\n    If I move LEFT, I can eat (5, 1) on T16.\n\n**Re-evaluating (5, 1) Competition:**\nS1 is at (3, 1).\nS1 needs M=2 to reach (5, 1) (R to (4, 1), R to (5, 1)). S1 reaches (5, 1) on T17.\n*Wait:* My previous rationale calculation was based on S1 eating at T14, meaning S1's move *this turn* (T15) would be (4, 1), and T16 would be (5, 1). Let's verify:\n*   T14: S1 (2, 1) -> (3, 1) EAT. S0 (7, 0) -> (7, 1).\n*   T15: S1 (3, 1) -> (4, 1). S0 (7, 1) -> ?\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 1) this turn (T15):\n*   T15: S0 (6, 1). S1 (4, 1).\n*   T16: S0 (6, 1) -> (5, 1) EAT. S1 (4, 1) -> (5, 1).\n**This is a Head-on Collision at (5, 1) on Turn 16. I must avoid LEFT.**\n\nTherefore, I must continue with the strategic northern movement, ceding (5, 1) to avoid death, even though it appears I could reach the apple potentially simultaneously.\n\n**Choosing UP (to 7, 2):**\nThis move continues my previous plan to avoid conflict and target (9, 8).\n\n*   T15: S0 UP (7, 2). S1 R (4, 1). (No conflict)\n*   T16: S0 UP (7, 3). S1 R (5, 1) EAT. (No conflict, S1 claims apple 5)\n\nThis yields a safe path and commits to the northern hemisphere, where I have two uncontested high-value targets currently.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Reminder:**\nContinue moving UP towards (7, 8). Then maneuver right to (9, 8) to eat around T23. S1 is currently bottlenecked in the bottom left, having difficulty reaching high y-coordinates quickly. I will maximize this positional advantage.\n\nUP",

S1 is now at (4, 1) and will likely eat (5, 1) this turn. My goal is to maximize my positional advantage in the top right quadrant toward (9, 8), (9, 6), and (5, 9).\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 2)**\n\nBody segments to avoid: (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Safety Check (Wall/Body) | Enemy Head Collision Risk | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 3) | SAFE | None (S1 is at (4, 1)) | Excellent |\n| DOWN | (7, 1) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (7, 1) - backwards) | None | Kill |\n| LEFT | (6, 2) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (8, 2) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n\nAll moves except DOWN are safe regarding immediate death.\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 7, 3):**\n    *   Pathing to (9, 8): 5 UP, 2 RIGHT. (M=7). This is the most direct path north. Maintains the high-ground strategy.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 8, 2):**\n    *   Pathing to (9, 8): 6 UP, 1 RIGHT. (M=7). Same distance as UP, slightly better X coordinate for the final approach to X=9.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 6, 2):**\n    *   Pathing to (9, 8): M=8 (6 UP, 3 R, or 1 R, 6 U, 2 R). Moves away from targets (9, 8) and (9, 6). Poor choice.\n\n**Choosing between UP and RIGHT:**\n\nBoth UP (7, 3) and RIGHT (8, 2) keep the Manhattan distance to (9, 8) at 7.\n\n*   Moving UP to (7, 3) keeps my snake aligned vertically, making the final horizontal move easier towards either (9, 8) or (9, 6).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (8, 2) makes the final horizontal move shorter for (9, 8) (1 unit right vs 2 units right).\n\nLet's assume S1 moves RIGHT again to (5, 1) and eats the apple. S1 will be at (5, 1) with a new body segment at (4, 1).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (8, 2):\n*   T16: S0 (8, 2). S1 (5, 1) EAT.\n*   T17: S0 (9, 2). S1 will likely move UP (5, 2) or LEFT (4, 1) to target (5, 9) or (0, 0). (5, 9) is its closest high-value goal.\n\nIf I choose UP (7, 3):\n*   T16: S0 (7, 3). S1 (5, 1) EAT.\n*   T17: S0 (7, 4).\n\nBoth directional choices are strong. RIGHT is slightly more aggressive towards clearing the X-axis distance to the 9-column targets. UP is slightly more centrally positioned. Given the goal is (9, 8) and (9, 6), closing the gap on X=9 is slightly preferred, but ultimately the vertical climb is the major component.\n\nLet's stick with the continued vertical climb (UP) as it simplifies navigation and keeps the snake away from the clutter on the X=8 column which currently holds some of its body segments ((8, 0), (8, 1)). Moving UP maintains cleaner separation.\n\n**Pre-visualization of next few turns (targeting (9, 8)):**\nT16: (7, 3) [UP]\nT17: (7, 4) [UP]\nT18: (7, 5) [UP]\nT19: (7, 6) [UP]\nT20: (7, 7) [UP]\nT21: (7, 8) [UP]\nT22: (8, 8) [RIGHT]\nT23: (9, 8) [RIGHT] EAT (Assuming uncontested path)\n\nThis vertical stack is very safe and efficient.\n\nS1 will likely move to (5, 1) this turn. It will then likely turn UP towards (5, 9) or LEFT towards (0, 0). I have a significant head start on (9, 8) and (9, 6).\n\nUP\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 16 / 150\n\n**Current Strategy:** Since I successfully executed the pivot north (T15 UP to (7, 2)) to avoid a collision with S1 at (5, 1), my goal remains securing the high-Y apples (9, 8) and (9, 6). S1 is at (4, 1) and should consume (5, 1) this turn.\n\n**Move Choice (UP):** Moving UP to (7, 3) is the most direct and safest way to continue the vertical climb towards the northern targets. While RIGHT to (8, 2) offered the same M-distance, UP keeps the snake away from its body segments and allows for an unhindered climb before making the necessary horizontal shift to X=9.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (T17-T23):** Continue moving UP until approximately (7, 8) or (7, 7), then turn RIGHT to reach (9, 8). This path is long but currently uncontested. S1 will likely pivot towards (5, 9) or (0, 0).\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nUP",

(Note: The provided body list for T17 in the prompt `[(7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0)]` implies the tail is at (8, 0). The previous turn's body included (8, 1) and its tail was (8, 1). If I moved from (7, 2) to (7, 3), the body should be [(7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]. However, based on the provided data for T17, I must use the 5-segment body list provided. Let's assume the body has shrunk or the tail segment (8, 1) was overwritten/dropped if I didn't eat an apple, which is correct since I moved UP from (7, 2) to (7, 3) without eating. The new tail will be (7, 0). The old tail (8, 0) drops off.\n*Correction:*\nPrevious turn T16: Head (7, 2). Body: [(7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]. Length 5.\nMove UP to (7, 3). No apple eaten.\nNew Head (7, 3). New Body: [(7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0)]. Length 5. Tail is now (8, 0). This matches the provided body list, so I proceed with this configuration.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1): Head (5, 1). Length: 5 segments now (likely ate the apple at (5, 1) on T16).\nBody: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. (Assuming S1 ate apple (5, 1) and grew).\n*Self-Correction on Enemy Snake Status*: The supplied game state shows S1 at Head: (5, 1) and Body: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. This is a length of 5. It confirms S1 likely ate the apple at (5, 1) on the previous turn (T16), growing to 5 apples. The board state suggests S1's body configuration.\n\nApples: (0, 0), (9, 8), (5, 9), (9, 6), (3, 8).\n\n**Strategic Objective**\nContinue the path upwards towards the high-value, high-Y targets (9, 8) and (9, 6). S1 is currently centralized and might target (5, 9) or (0, 0). My current position (7, 3) is safe for vertical ascent.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 3)**\n\nBody segments to avoid: (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Safety Check (Wall/Body) | Enemy Collision Risk (S1 at 5, 1) | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 4) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n| DOWN | (7, 2) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (7, 2) - backwards) | None | Kill |\n| LEFT | (6, 3) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (8, 3) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 7, 4):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-7) + (8-4) = 2 + 4 = 6.\n    *   Maintains the vertical ascent strategy. Very safe.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 8, 3):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-8) + (8-3) = 1 + 5 = 6.\n    *   Closes the X-gap by 1. Offers slightly more flexibility for the final approach to X=9 targets later.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 6, 3):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-6) + (8-3) = 3 + 5 = 8.\n    *   Worsens position relative to targets (9, 8) and (9, 6).\n\n**Choosing between UP and RIGHT (Both M=6 to (9, 8)):**\n\nMoving UP (7, 4) continues the stacking away from the enemy.\nMoving RIGHT (8, 3) is more aggressive spatially towards the targets but moves adjacent to the dead segment (8, 0). While safe, continuing UP remains cleaner and more resilient if S1 were to suddenly try to block access higher up the board.\n\nGiven S1 is at (5, 1), it is unlikely to contest the X=9 apples immediately.\nS1's closest targets are (5, 9) (M=8) or (0, 0) (M=6). S1 is likely to go for (0, 0) or (3, 8). If S1 goes for (3, 8), it needs to move 2 LEFT, 7 UP (M=9). If S1 goes for (5, 9), it needs 8 UP (M=8). (0, 0) requires 4 LEFT, 1 DOWN (M=5). (0, 0) is the closest mathematically.\n\nIf S1 moves to (4, 1) (LEFT) towards (0, 0) or maintains position (5, 2) (UP) towards (5, 9), my vertical path is clear.\n\nI will continue the straightforward path UP to maximize safety and efficiency toward (9, 8).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (T17-T22):**\nT17: (7, 4) [UP]\nT18: (7, 5) [UP]\nT19: (7, 6) [UP] -> Now close to (9, 6). Might divert here if (9, 8) looks contested.\nT20: (7, 7) [UP]\nT21: (7, 8) [UP]\nT22: (8, 8) [RIGHT]\nT23: (9, 8) [RIGHT] EAT\n\nIf I reach (7, 6) and (9, 6) is available, I might switch to RIGHT.\n\nLet's stick with UP.\n\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 17 / 150\n\n**Strategy:** Continue maximizing vertical separation from S1 and approaching the northeastern apples (9, 8) and (9, 6). S1 is at (5, 1), having likely eaten the apple there. Its closest apple is (0, 0) (M=5).\n\n**Move Choice (UP):** Moving UP to (7, 4) is the continuation of the safe, direct vertical ascent. It maintains distance from S1 and efficiently reduces the Y-component of the distance to the target (9, 8). While RIGHT (8, 3) is equally distant, UP maintains better lane integrity.\n\n**Anticipated Enemy Movement:** S1 will likely move LEFT towards (0, 0) or UP towards (5, 9). Either way, S1 is moving away from my target area, reinforcing the safety of my continued upward movement.\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nUP",

My current position (7, 4) is perfectly positioned for a vertical ascent. S1 is currently centralized at (5, 2) and is not immediately threatening my path.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 4)**\n\nBody segments to avoid: (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0).\nCurrent S1 segments: (5, 2) (Head), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Collision Check (Wall/Body) | S1 Head Collision Risk (S1 targets 5, 2 -> X') | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 5) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n| DOWN | (7, 3) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (7, 3) - backwards) | None | Kill |\n| LEFT | (6, 4) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (8, 4) | SAFE | None | Safe |\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Predicting Enemy Movement (S1 Head at 5, 2)**\nS1's closest remaining apple is (0, 0) (M=7: 5L, 2D) or (3, 8) (M=7: 2L, 6U). (5, 9) is M=7 (7U). (0, 0) is slightly harder due to length 5 body along Y=1.\nPossible S1 moves:\n1. UP (5, 3): Towards (5, 9) or (3, 8).\n2. LEFT (4, 2): Towards (3, 8).\n3. RIGHT (6, 2): Generally bad direction.\n4. DOWN (5, 1): Into its own body segment (5, 1) -> **FATAL**.\n\nS1 is likely to move UP (5, 3) or LEFT (4, 2). Neither move threatens my current location or chosen path UP the X=7 axis.\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 7, 5):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-7) + (8-5) = 2 + 3 = 5.\n    *   Continues the most efficient, safest path toward the targeted area (9, Y). Maintains flexibility.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 8, 4):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-8) + (8-4) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n    *   Equally minimal M-distance to (9, 8). This is also a strong move, setting up for a straight approach along Y=8 eventually.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 6, 4):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-6) + (8-4) = 3 + 4 = 7.\n    *   Worsens position.\n\n**Choosing between UP and RIGHT (M=5):**\n\nBoth UP (7, 5) and RIGHT (8, 4) are excellent.\nIf I go UP: (7, 5) -> (7, 6). I am directly below (9, 6) (M=2 T=4).\nIf I go RIGHT: (8, 4) -> (8, 5). I am also directly setting up for X=9.\n\nMoving UP keeps me on X=7, which is safer as it maintains a vertical highway away from S1's current activity (mostly X<6).\nMoving RIGHT brings me one step closer to the target X-coordinate (9). Since S1 is far away, maximizing horizontal movement now to minimize future turns might be slightly beneficial.\n\nLet's look ahead:\nFrom (7, 4):\nIf UP to (7, 5): Next move can be UP to (7, 6). Then RIGHT to (8, 6) (or (7, 7)). (9, 6) is 3 moves away at (7, 6).\nIf RIGHT to (8, 4): Next move can be UP to (8, 5). Then UP to (8, 6). (9, 6) is 3 moves away at (8, 6).\n\nBoth paths take roughly the same time to reach X=9. Sticking to the vertical vector (UP) feels slightly more conservative and maintains board center control for longer, making it robust against unexpected S1 moves. I will continue the planned vertical ascent.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (T18-T22):**\nT18: (7, 5) [UP]\nT19: (7, 6) [UP] -> If (9, 6) is free, target (9, 6).\nT20: (7, 7) [UP]\n\nThe goal is to get high enough to then move RIGHT to strike (9, 8) or (9, 6).\n\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 18 / 150\n\n**Strategy:** Maintain high-Y trajectory towards the cluster of apples at X=9, Y=6 and Y=8, leveraging the safety of the X=7 column. S1 is currently distracted elsewhere (likely targeting (0, 0) or (3, 8)).\n\n**Move Choice (UP):** Move to (7, 5). This is a safe move that continues the direct path towards the northeast targets. It keeps the snake centralized in its column, minimizing exposure to S1 activity further left.\n\n**Anticipated Enemy Movement:** S1 is expected to continue UP (towards (5, 9)) or LEFT (towards (3, 8) or (0, 0)). This separation ensures my vertical climb is uncontested.\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nUP",

My current position (7, 5) maintains a safe vertical trajectory.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 5)**\n\nBody segments to avoid: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1).\nCurrent S1 segments: (5, 3) (Head), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Collision Check (Wall/Body) | Safe from S1 Body/Wall | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 6) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe |\n| DOWN | (7, 4) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (7, 4) - backwards) | N/A | Kill |\n| LEFT | (6, 5) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (8, 5) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe |\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Predicting Enemy Movement (S1 Head at 5, 3)**\nS1 is currently positioned well for (5, 9) (M=6: 6U). It could also target (3, 8) (M=5: 2L, 5U) or continue towards (0, 0).\nPossible S1 moves:\n1. UP (5, 4): Optimal for (5, 9) or set up for (3, 8).\n2. LEFT (4, 3): Sets up for (3, 8).\n3. RIGHT (6, 3): Less likely, away from obvious apples.\n4. DOWN (5, 2): Hitting its own body segment (5, 2) -> **FATAL**.\n\nS1 is highly likely to move UP (5, 4) or LEFT (4, 3). Neither move creates a direct head-on collision threat with my snake at (7, 5).\n\n**Comparative Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\nThe goal is to move towards (9, 6) and (9, 8).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 7, 6):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 6): (9-7) + (6-6) = 2.\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-7) + (8-6) = 4.\n    *   This move points me directly at (9, 6), requiring only two right moves thereafter. It continues the protected vertical ascent.\n    *   This is the cell directly below the (9, 6) apple's Y-coordinate.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 8, 5):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 6): (9-8) + (6-5) = 2.\n    *   M-distance to (9, 8): (9-8) + (8-5) = 4.\n    *   This move achieves the same minimal M-distance to (9, 6). It maximizes X progress.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   M-distance to (9, 6): (9-6) + (6-5) = 4.\n    *   Worsens position relative to immediate goals (9, 6) and (9, 8). Avoid.\n\n**Choosing between UP (7, 6) and RIGHT (8, 5):**\n\nBoth lead to the apple (9, 6) in two more moves (e.g., UP -> RIGHT -> RIGHT OR RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT).\n\n*   Path A (UP): (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) (3 moves total)\n*   Path B (RIGHT): (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) (3 moves total)\n*   Path C (RIGHT then UP): (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 6) (3 moves total)\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are equivalent in efficiency. Moving UP maintains the vertical column approach, which is slightly more protected from S1 (who is moving up the X=5 column). Moving RIGHT sets up for a potentially faster movement to the X=9 boundary, but then requires stopping the vertical progression.\n\nSince I am aiming for two apples at X=9 (Y=6 and Y=8), maximizing height first allows me to acquire Y=8 first if needed, or descend to Y=6.\n\nLet's maintain the planned vertical climb. (7, 6) is a very good staging point.\n\n**Plan for Next Few Turns:**\nT19: UP to (7, 6).\nT20: UP to (7, 7) or RIGHT to (8, 6). If S1 is far, moving right towards X=9 is good. If UP is still the safest path, I might go (7, 7) to prepare for (9, 8).\n\nSince (9, 6) is closer, and I can reach it by (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6), let's prioritize the right turn soon.\n\nT19: (7, 6) [UP]. Safest and maintains option diversity.\n\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 19 / 150\n\n**Strategy:** Continue safe vertical ascent on X=7 to position for attack on the X=9 apple cluster ((9, 6) and (9, 8)). Enemy Snake #1 (S1) is likely moving UP towards (5, 9) or LEFT towards (3, 8), maintaining separation.\n\n**Move Choice (UP):** Move to (7, 6). This move is non-fatal and minimizes distance to (9, 6) and (9, 8). It keeps the snake on a clear path away from S1's likely range of influence along X<6.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (T19-T21):**\nT19: UP to (7, 6).\nT20: RIGHT to (8, 6) (sets up for a quick grab of (9, 6)).\nT21: RIGHT to (9, 6) (Grab apple if successful).\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nUP",

Tail (5, 2) is vacated and is now free space).\n\n**Board Evaluation & Apple Targeting**\nMy current head is at (9, 6).\nThe closest apple is at (9, 8) (D=2, straight UP).\nThe next closest apples are (9, 2) (D=4, four DOWN) and (5, 9) (D=7, LEFT and UP).\n\nMy primary goal is to move towards (9, 8) to secure the next apple.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (9, 6)**\n\nMy Body segments to avoid: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3).\nS1 Segments: (5, 6) (Head), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3).\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Collision Check (Wall/Body) | Collision with S1 Head (5, 6)? | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (9, 7) | SAFE | S1 must move to (9, 7) from (5, 6) (M-dist 4, possible head-on collision if S1 moves RIGHT three times and UP, unlikely) | SAFE |\n| DOWN | (9, 5) | SAFE | S1 must move to (9, 5) from (5, 6) (M-dist 3, unlikely) | SAFE |\n| LEFT | (8, 6) | **FATAL** (Into own body segment (8, 6)) | N/A | Kill |\n| RIGHT | (10, 6) | **FATAL** (Off board X=10) | N/A | Kill |\n\nSafe moves: UP (9, 7) and DOWN (9, 5).\n\n**Selecting the Move**\nMoving UP to (9, 7) progresses directly towards the apple at (9, 8). This is the optimal strategic move.\n\n**Predicting Enemy Movement (S1 Head at 5, 6)**\nS1 is currently positioned well to chase the apple at (5, 9).\n1. UP (5, 7): Highly predicted (moves towards (5, 9)).\n2. RIGHT (6, 6): Less likely.\n3. LEFT (4, 6): Less likely.\n4. DOWN (5, 5): **FATAL** (Into own body segment (5, 5)).\n\nS1 is highly likely to move UP to (5, 7). This move poses no threat to me at (9, 7).\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on at (9, 7))**:\nS1 is at (5, 6). To reach (9, 7) in one turn, S1 would require X to change by +4 and Y to change by +1. Manhattan distance is 5. Impossible. No head-on collision possible at (9, 7).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (9, 7) is safe and positions me for immediate apple consumption next turn.\n\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 22 / 150\n\n**Strategy:** Continue securing apples on the right side of the board. The next target is (9, 8).\n\n**Move Choice (UP):** Move to (9, 7). This is safe and minimizes the distance to the apple at (9, 8).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (T23):**\nT23: UP to (9, 8) to acquire the apple. My head will then be at (9, 8), and I will have 6 apples.\nThe next closest apple appears to be (9, 2), down the right wall, or (5, 9) if S1 doesn't get it first.\nIf S1 gets (5, 9), I will pivot to (9, 2).\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nUP",

I must maneuver.**\n\n1. **Move UP to (9, 9):**\n   * Puts me on the top edge. Safe.\n   * Next turn (T25), I can move LEFT to (8, 9).\n   * T26: Move DOWN (8, 8) or (8, 7) depending on S1 position. This is a long detour to reach (9, 2).\n\n2. **Move LEFT to (8, 8):**\n   * Puts me adjacent to my body. Safe.\n   * Next turn (T25):\n     * If I move RIGHT (9, 8), I am back where I started.\n     * If I move DOWN (8, 7): Safe movement towards the center/left.\n     * If I move LEFT (7, 8): Safe.\n     * If I move UP (8, 9): Safe.\n   * Moving LEFT to (8, 8) allows me to wrap around my own body (9, 7), (9, 6) towards the center of the board, which is necessary to access (9, 2) safely.\n\n**Prediction for S1 (Head 5, 8):**\nS1's primary target is (5, 9) which is 1 step UP.\nPrediction: S1 moves UP to (5, 9) and collects the apple.\nIf S1 moves UP, their head moves to (5, 9). Next target for S1 might be (3, 8) or (0, 0).\n\n**Choosing LEFT (8, 8):**\nBy moving LEFT, I decouple my head from the column 9 and prepare to move DOWN/LEFT, out of the immediate self-trap.\n\nT24: Move LEFT to (8, 8).\nT25: Move DOWN to (8, 7). This is safe as my body segment (9, 7) is not (8, 7).\nT26: Move DOWN to (8, 6). Safe (my body is (9, 6), (7, 6)).\nT27: Move RIGHT to (9, 6) or DOWN to (8, 5). Moving RIGHT to (9, 6) would be fatal (into my body). I must continue down/left or wait for my body to shorten.\n\nSince my tail is at (7, 4) and I am 7 segments long:\nT24: Head (8, 8). Tail (7, 4). (Tail remains)\nT25: Head (8, 7). Tail (7, 4). (Tail shifts to (7, 5) if I don't eat)\nT26: Head (8, 6). Tail (7, 5).\n(8, 6) is safe from my body since (7, 6) is not (8, 6).\n\nThis path (LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN) gets me close to the center for subsequent movement to (9, 2) or (3, 8).\n\nLet's check the alternative, UP (9, 9):\nT24: Head (9, 9). Tail (7, 4).\nT25: Head (8, 9) (LEFT). Tail (7, 4).\nT26: Head (8, 8) (DOWN). Tail (7, 5).\nThis is a longer path to get to (8, 8) than starting with LEFT.\n\nMoving LEFT (8, 8) is the most efficient way to break free of the (9, 8)-(9, 7) configuration while maintaining a high position on the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T25 onwards):**\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 8) at T24.\n2. Aim to move towards (9, 2) via the path: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), then swinging RIGHT when safe. This path avoids immediate body collisions.\n3. If S1 takes (5, 9), S1 will then likely contest (3, 8) or (0, 0). I prioritize (9, 2) which is isolated on the right.\n\nLEFT",

If the provided body list is correct, my length is 7, and I did NOT grow last turn (which means I did not eat an apple at T24, despite the score update). This contradicts the score increase (6 apples) and the prior turn's analysis where it was assumed I ate at (9, 8).*\n\n**Assumption based on provided data:**\nMy snake is currently 7 segments long (H: (8, 8) + Body: 6 segments).\nHead: (8, 8).

(0, 5): M-dist 11.\n\nI need to continue my maneuver from (8, 8) to descend towards the bottom of the board, likely aiming for (9, 2).\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (8, 8)**\n\nMy Segments to avoid (Body T): (9, 8) [Neck], (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5) [Tail].\nSince I did not eat at T24 (based on the provided body length), (7, 5) will vacate if I move safely.\nS1 Head (1): (5, 9). S1 Body (1): (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4). S1 Tail (5, 4) will vacate.\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Collision Check (Wall/Body) | Collision with S1 Head (5, 9)? | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 9) | SAFE (Only wall is at Y=10) | S1 must move 3R, 0U.

Safe. | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (9, 8) | **FATAL** (Into own neck/body segment (9, 8)) | N/A | Kill |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Choice**\n\nI need to move DOWN towards (9, 2). Moving UP (8, 9) forces a detour. Moving LEFT (7, 8) moves me away from the right side.\n\nThe best move is **DOWN to (8, 7)**. This continues the descent and puts me in a good position for the next turn.\n\n**T26 Outlook (If I move DOWN to (8, 7))**\nHead: (8, 7). Tail vacates (7, 5). New Tail (7, 6).\nSafe moves from (8, 7):\n* DOWN to (8, 6): **FATAL**, my body segment (8, 6) is right there.\n* UP to (8, 8): Safe, but backward.\n* LEFT to (7, 7): Safe.\n* RIGHT to (9, 7): **FATAL**, my body segment (9, 7) is right there.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7), I immediately face a self-trap because (8, 6) and (9, 7) are body segments. I will only be able to move LEFT (7, 7) or UP (8, 8).\n\nThis means moving DOWN is highly restrictive for T26. I must find a path that avoids pinning myself against my own body cluster (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6).\n\nLet's re-examine moving **LEFT to (7, 8)**.\nT26 Outlook (If I move LEFT to (7, 8)):\nHead: (7, 8). Tail vacates (7, 5). New Tail (7, 6).\nSafe moves from (7, 8):\n* UP to (7, 9): Safe.\n* DOWN to (7, 7): Safe.\n* LEFT to (6, 8): Safe.\n* RIGHT to (8, 8): Safe (Only my neck (9, 8) and body (8, 6) are nearby).\n\nMoving LEFT (7, 8) maintains flexibility and enables movement towards the center/left, or a longer spiral around my existing body mass to get to (9, 2).\n\nPath to (9, 2) via LEFT:\nT25: (7, 8) [LEFT]\nT26: (7, 7) [DOWN]\nT27: (7, 6) [FATAL - Into body]\n\nI must move into the open space where I can maintain safety while shortening my body relative to the target area. Since my body is 7 segments long, it shortens by 1 step each turn I don't eat.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8): I have broken free of the column 9 congestion.\n\nIf I then move LEFT again to (6, 8):\nT26: (6, 8). Safe. Tail (8, 6).\nT27: (5, 8). Safe. Tail (9, 6).\n\nThis path moves me towards the center/left targets: (3, 8), (0, 5), (1, 3). Perhaps abandoning (9, 2) temporarily is wise due to the immediate self-trap constraint around (8, 7) and (9, 7). (3, 8) is now viable.\n\nS1 is at (5, 9). S1 will likely move DOWN towards (5, 8) or LEFT/RIGHT along the top border to reach an apple like (3, 8) or (0, 5).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (5, 8), they are in a strong position to contest (3, 8).\n\nIf I move LEFT (7, 8):\nS1's move will dictate my priority shift. If S1 moves:\n1. (5, 8) [DOWN]: I can move to (7, 7) or (6, 8). (3, 8) becomes dangerous. I might aim for (1, 3).\n2. (4, 9) [LEFT]: S1 is aiming for (3, 8). I may need to race S1.\n\nI should prioritize mobility and safety over immediately chasing a difficult apple. Moving LEFT to (7, 8) is the most flexible option.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T26 onwards):**\nContinue moving LEFT/DOWN toward the center-left targets ((3, 8), (1, 3), (0, 5)), minimizing risk of collision with S1 (currently (5, 9)). If S1 moves DOWN, I will focus on (1, 3) or (0, 0). If S1 moves LEFT, I will contest (3, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Highly unlikely S1 will move R. | Safe |\n| DOWN | (7, 7) | Safe (Only (7, 6) is body, which will vacate) | S1 must move 3R, 2D (7, 7). Very unlikely. | Safe |\n| LEFT | (6, 8) | Safe | S1 could move 2R (6, 9 -> 6, 8). S1 is likely aiming for (3, 8). Risk moderate-low. | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (8, 8) | **FATAL** (Into own neck/body segment (8, 8)) | N/A | Kill |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis**\n\nI selected LEFT last turn to clear the congestion near (8, 8)/(9, 8). Now I am at (7, 8). My closest apple is (3, 8).\n\n1. **Move LEFT to (6, 8)**: This is the most direct route towards (3, 8).\n   * Distance to (3, 8) reduces to M-dist 3.\n   * Collision risk with S1: S1 is at (4, 9). If S1 moves LEFT to (3, 9) (aiming for 3, 8), and I move LEFT to (6, 8), we are still safely separated. If S1 moves DOWN to (4, 8), they are two steps away, and directly contesting (3, 8).\n   * If I move (6, 8), next turn I can move LEFT (5, 8) or DOWN (6, 7).\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (7, 7)**: This moves me away from S1's immediate threat zone but slightly delays reaching (3, 8).\n   * S1 might move (4, 8) or (3, 9).\n   * If I move (7, 7), next turn options are: UP (7, 8 - backward), DOWN (7, 6 - safe, as tail vacates), LEFT (6, 7), RIGHT (8, 7). Moving DOWN again to (7, 6) is excellent for escaping my immediate cluster and moving towards the bottom.\n\n3. **Move UP to (7, 9)**: This is primarily defensive, moving away from S1 and the cluster, but sacrificing apple proximity.\n\nS1 at (4, 9) has strong options:\nA. LEFT to (3, 9) - Target (3, 8).\nB. DOWN to (4, 8) - Target (3, 8).\nC. RIGHT to (5, 9) - Into own body. **FATAL**. (Wait, S1's body starts at (5, 9) which is the neck. S1 head is (4, 9). A move RIGHT to (5, 9) is into the neck. **FATAL**).\nD. UP to (4, 10) - Wall collision. **FATAL**.\n\nS1 literally only has two viable moves: LEFT to (3, 9) or DOWN to (4, 8). Both moves target (3, 8).\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT (3, 9): I should move LEFT (6, 8) to secure space and maintain the contest. The apple (3, 8) may be eaten by S1 next turn if they move DOWN from (3, 9).\nIf S1 moves DOWN (4, 8): I should move LEFT (6, 8). S1 is then one step closer to (3, 8).\n\nSince I have a 1-apple lead, but S1 is positioned better for (3, 8), I must weigh pursuit vs. safety and flexibility.\n\n**Option 1: Pursue (3, 8) with LEFT (7, 8) -> (6, 8)**\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8), I am still 3 steps away from (3, 8) (e.g., L, D, L). S1 is 1 step away if they choose (4, 8) and then move L to (3, 8), OR 2 steps away if they choose (3, 9) and then D to (3, 8). S1 has the advantage. If S1 eats it next turn, I must be ready to pivot.\n\n**Option 2: Clear the cluster with DOWN (7, 8) -> (7, 7)**\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 7), I get to the center and then can choose to move further DOWN to (7, 6) next turn (vacated spot) to aim for apples (1, 3) or (0, 0), or spiral back around for (9, 2). This maintains maximum safe movement options for the immediate future.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8), I might get stuck near S1 if they come down quickly, or get pinned against the border trying to reach (3, 8).\n\nLet's prioritize safety and flexibility, especially since S1 is already closing in on the most proximal apple. By moving DOWN, I use the tail vacancy to progress towards the bottom quadrant, where I have two uncontested apples ((9, 2), (0, 0)) and one likely accessible apple ((1, 3)).\n\nMove DOWN to (7, 7).\n\n*T26 Long-Term Plan (If I move DOWN to 7, 7):*\n1. T27: Move DOWN to (7, 6) (tail vacates). This entirely clears me from the upper right congestion.\n2. T28: Move DOWN to (7, 5) or LEFT/RIGHT to circle towards (1, 3) or (9, 2).\nThis creates high movement freedom and focuses on the uncontested lower board.\n\nDOWN",

Very unlikely. | Safe |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis**\n\nMy move last turn (DOWN to (7, 7)) successfully moved me out of the immediate congestion. Now I am aiming for the lower part of the board, as A2 (3, 8) is likely S1's target.\n\nS1 at (3, 9) has three safe moves:\n1. LEFT to (2, 9): Away from A2. Unlikely.\n2. DOWN to (3, 8): **EATS A2**.\n3. RIGHT to (4, 9): **FATAL** (Into own body segment (4, 9)). Wait, S1's head is (3, 9) and the body segment is (4, 9). Moving right to (4, 9) is moving into the neck. **FATAL**.\n\nS1 only has two safe moves: LEFT (2, 9) or DOWN (3, 8). Since A2 is vital, S1 will almost certainly move DOWN and eat the apple. I should assume A2 (3, 8) will be gone.\n\nMy task is to pivot smoothly towards the next best target.\n\n1. **Move DOWN to (7, 6)**:\n   * Moves me further away from S1's territory.\n   * Opens the path to the bottom edge.\n   * Next turn, I can move DOWN (to 7, 5) or LEFT (to 6, 6). This is excellent for flexibility and setting up approaches to A3 (9, 2).\n\n2. **Move RIGHT to (8, 7)**:\n   * Moves me closer to my own body cluster (8, 8) and (9, 7).\n   * This path is okay toward A3 (9, 2), M-dist becomes 6.\n   * Next moves could be to (8, 6) (tail vacancy) or (9, 7) (collision, bad).\n\n3. **Move LEFT to (6, 7)**:\n   * Moves me closer to the center, putting me roughly equal distance to A5 (1, 3) and A3 (9, 2).\n   * M-dist to A5 (1, 3) is now 8. M-dist to A3 (9, 2) is 7.\n   * If S1 eats A2, S1 will grow and might move toward the left border or down the center.\n\nGiven that I want to improve positioning and avoid the upper half where S1 is now strong, moving DOWN seems like the safest and strategically best long-term option, aiming to get to A3 (9, 2) or A5 (1, 3) via the center-right or center-bottom.\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (7, 6):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (8, 6) (tail vacancy) and then towards (9, 2).\nPath to (9, 2): (7, 6) -> R (8, 6) -> R (9, 6) [This segment is currently part of the body, but it shifts, becoming 9, 7] -> D (9, 5) -> ... This looks efficient.\n\nLet's stick with the plan to clear the congestion and prioritize the lower apples.\n\n**Move DOWN to (7, 6).**\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (T28 onwards):**\nAssume S1 eats (3, 8). My current move is DOWN to (7, 6).\nNext turn (T28), my tail will vacate (9, 6). The segment (8, 6) will be the new tail.\nFrom (7, 6), I should move RIGHT to (8, 6) (targeting the tail vacancy) to continue clearing the cluster and position myself strongly for A3 (9, 2).\n***\n\nDOWN",

Very unlikely. | Safe, Good positioning |\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Selection**\n\nThe goal is to move towards A2 (9, 2) and A5 (6, 1) while continuing to clear the body cluster on the right edge. The segment (8, 6) is currently free. Moving RIGHT to (8, 6) positions me perfectly.\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (8, 6)**:\n   * M-dist to A2 (9, 2) drops to 5.\n   * M-dist to A5 (6, 1) remains 7.\n   * This path maximizes the use of free space and gets me closer to A2 (9, 2) efficiently.\n   * Next turn, the tail will vacate (9, 7). From (8, 6) I can move RIGHT to (9, 6) (using the space vacated by the previous body segment, though (9, 6) is currently the tail) and then turn down the edge. Wait, (9, 6) is the current tail *vacancy* if no apple was eaten last turn. Since I moved to (7, 6), (9, 6) is the new tail position. So moving to (9, 6) next turn is viable.\n   * Path: (7, 6) -> R (8, 6) -> R (9, 6) [Tail now at (9, 7)] -> D (9, 5) -> D (9, 4) -> ... towards (9, 2). This is great.\n\n2. **Move LEFT to (6, 6)**:\n   * M-dist to A5 (6, 1) drops to 5.\n   * M-dist to A2 (9, 2) remains 7.\n   * This move directly targets A5 (6, 1) and positions me centrally, potentially away from S1 if S1 moves left, or potentially meeting S1 if S1 moves down the 3-column. Riskier engagement with S1's potential path.\n\n3. **Move DOWN to (7, 5)**:\n   * M-dist to A2 (9, 2) is 7.\n   * M-dist to A5 (6, 1) is 7.\n   * This is a safe fallback but pulls me away from the body cluster I need to clear on the right.\n\n**Decision:** Moving RIGHT to (8, 6) is the most effective move to clear space, position for the currently closest apple (9, 2), and avoid the upper-left quadrant where S1 is operating.\n\n**S1 Prediction:** S1 is at (3, 8). S1 will likely move DOWN to (3, 7) or LEFT to (2, 8) to approach A3 (0, 5). Both are safe moves. If S1 moves DOWN, its body is further extended vertically, slightly increasing pressure on the center lanes.\n\nMy move RIGHT to (8, 6) maintains maximum distance from S1. There are no collision risks.\n\n**Move RIGHT to (8, 6).**\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (T29 onwards):**\nMy snake is now at (8, 6). The tail vacated (9, 7).\nNext turn (T29), I should move RIGHT to (9, 6) to continue hugging the right wall and move closer to A2 (9, 2). The segment (9, 6) will be safe as the tail has moved to (9, 7) or if an apple was eaten, the segment (9, 6) will become a vacancy from the tail at (9, 8). Since my head was (7, 6) and tail was (9, 6), my body was [(7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]. Moving to (8, 6) means the new body is [(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7)], and the new tail vacancy is (9, 6). Yes, moving to (9, 6) next turn is a priority.\n***\n\nRIGHT",

A safe path involves moving LEFT towards the center: (8, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1).

Length: 8 segments.\nBody: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\nApples collected: 7.\nS1 moved DOWN, from (0, 5) to (0, 4). This confirms S1 is targeting the left-side apples like A5 (1, 4) or A2 (1, 3).\n\nScores are tied 7-7.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0)\nA2: (1, 3)\nA3: (6, 1) - MD=3\nA4: (6, 3) - MD=3\nA5: (1, 4)\n\nMy primary targets remain A3 (6, 1) and A4 (6, 3). Both are MD=3 away, requiring 3 more moves to reach the 6th column.\n\n**S1 Threat Assessment (Head at 0, 4):**\nS1 is now positioned directly beneath A5 (1, 4).\nS1's safe moves:\n1. UP to (0, 5): Into its old head position, safe.\n2. DOWN to (0, 3): Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (1, 4): **Eats A5!** This is the most likely move.\n4. LEFT to (-1, 4): Fatal (Off-board).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it eats A5.\n\n**My Strategic Goal:** Continue moving LEFT to reach the 6th column where A3 and A4 are located. I need two more LEFT moves.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (8, 2)**\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Self/Wall Collision? | S1 Head (0, 4) Collision risk? | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (8, 3) | Safe | No | Safe, leads towards A4 (6, 3) faster. |\n| DOWN | (8, 1) | Safe | No | Safe, leads towards A3 (6, 1) and away from my body wall. |\n| LEFT | (7, 2) | Safe | No | Safe, direct path towards the 6th column. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 2) | **FATAL** (Into own neck/body segment (9, 2)) | N/A | Kill |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** Maintains the current optimal horizontal trajectory. Next move would be LEFT to (6, 2). From (6, 2) I can go UP to A4 or DOWN to A3. This is reliable.\n2.  **UP to (8, 3):** This moves me 1 step closer to A4 (6, 3), but complicates the path to A3 (6, 1). If I go UP, my next move would likely be LEFT to (7, 3), then LEFT to (6, 3) (eating A4). (2 turns).\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** This moves me 1 step closer to A3 (6, 1). Next move would likely be LEFT to (7, 1), then LEFT to (6, 1) (eating A3). (2 turns).\n\nThe fastest way to reach an apple is 3 moves:\nOption A (LEFT-focus): (8, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3/1) - Requires 3 moves total if the third move is UP/DOWN onto the apple.\nOption B (UP/DOWN-focus): (8, 2) -> (8, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (6, 3) [A4] - Requires 3 moves.\nOption C (UP/DOWN-focus): (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) [A3] - Requires 3 moves.\n\nAll paths offer access to an apple in 3 turns.\n\nLet's look at the density of my snake's body:\nThe body runs vertically along X=9 from Y=2 to Y=6.\nIf I move UP to (8, 3), I start navigating alongside the long spine of my snake (9, 3) and (9, 4). This might restrict future movement options if S1 starts coming towards the right.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 1), I open up the bottom edge (0-0) and stay clear of my main body column. This feels slightly safer for long-term maneuverability.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 2), I maintain maximum flexibility, being equally distant vertically from both targets.\n\nGiven that S1 is now moving towards the center/left apples, my priority is ensuring rapid, safe collection of A3 or A4.\n\nIf I move LEFT: (7, 2) is safe.\nNext turn (T36): (7, 2) -> LEFT to (6, 2). Safe.\nNext turn (T37): (6, 2) -> UP to (6, 3) [A4] or DOWN to (6, 1) [A3]. Safe.\n\nThis path (LEFT, LEFT, UP/DOWN) is clean and avoids close approach to my own vertical body segments until the final approach.\n\nLet's stick with the most flexible move: LEFT.\n\n**Rationale for LEFT:**\n1. It continues the shortest geodesic path toward the central cluster of apples (A3 and A4).\n2. It minimizes constraints on future vertical movement until I have reached the 6th column.\n3. It keeps me far from S1's activity on the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT35: LEFT (to 7, 2)\nT36: LEFT (to 6, 2)\nT37: UP (to 6, 3, A4) or DOWN (to 6, 1, A3), depending on whichever path looks safest/clearer. A4 (6, 3) is usually preferable as it keeps me higher on the board.\n\nLEFT",

Length: 9 segments (S1 likely ate an apple last turn, likely (1, 4)).\nS1's previous head was (0, 4), and its current head is (1, 4). This confirms S1 moved RIGHT onto the apple that was at (1, 4). S1's body has expanded, which means its tail (previously 3, 8, is now still (3, 8) if the apple was eaten).\nBody: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\nApples collected: 8.\n\nScores: S1 leads 8-7. It is crucial for me to secure the next apple.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0)\nA2: (1, 3)\nA3: (6, 1) - Manhattan Distance (MD) from (7, 2): 1 + 1 = 2\nA4: (6, 3) - MD from (7, 2): 1 + 1 = 2\nA5: (4, 0) - MD from (7, 2): 3 + 2 = 5\n\nMy short-term goal is to reach A3 (6, 1) or A4 (6, 3) in 2 moves:\n(7, 2) -> (6, 2) [LEFT] -> (6, 3) [UP] or (6, 1) [DOWN].\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (7, 2)**\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Self/Wall Collision? | S1 Head (1, 4) Collision risk? | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (7, 3) | Safe | No | Safe, slightly favors A4 (6, 3). |\n| DOWN | (7, 1) | Safe | No | Safe, slightly favors A3 (6, 1). |\n| LEFT | (6, 2) | Safe | No | Safe, executes step 2 of the 2-move plan. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 2) | Into own body segment (8, 2) | N/A | **FATAL** (Hitting neck/old head) |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** This is the direct path to the target column (X=6). From (6, 2), I can immediately capture A3 or A4 next turn. This is the optimal move for immediate apple capture.\n    *   Path: (7, 2) -> (6, 2) [T36] -> (6, 3) [T37, A4] or (6, 1) [T37, A3]. (Capture in 2 turns).\n\n2.  **UP to (7, 3):** This requires an extra move to reach an apple compared to moving LEFT now.\n    *   Path: (7, 2) -> (7, 3) [T36] -> (6, 3) [T37, A4]. (Capture in 2 turns).\n\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** Similar to UP, it reaches A3 in 2 turns.\n    *   Path: (7, 2) -> (7, 1) [T36] -> (6, 1) [T37, A3]. (Capture in 2 turns).\n\nAll three safe moves result in an apple capture in 2 turns. However, moving LEFT now puts me at (6, 2), which is perfectly equidistant from both apples, allowing me to choose the safer approach or the higher apple next turn. If I move UP or DOWN, I commit more strongly to one apple now.\n\nGiven the tied timing, I prioritize the move that maintains the most flexibility and is simplest: LEFT.\n\n**S1's next move prediction (Head at 1, 4):**\nS1 just ate A5 and is now at length 9.\nApples near S1: A2 (1, 3). MD=1.\nS1 safe moves:\n*   DOWN to (1, 3): Eats A2. Highly likely.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 4): Safe.\n*   UP to (1, 5): Safe (into old body cell).\n*   LEFT to (0, 4): Into its own body segment (neck). FATAL.\n\nS1 will almost certainly move DOWN to capture A2 (1, 3), increasing its lead to 9-7. My immediate capture of A3 or A4 is critical to stay competitive.\n\nConclusion: Moving LEFT to (6, 2) on this turn is the most direct and flexible way to execute my 2-turn apple capture plan for A3 or A4.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT36: LEFT (to 6, 2)\nT37: UP (to 6, 3, A4) or DOWN (to 6, 1, A3). A4 is generally preferred as it is higher on the board, but both are options.\n---\n\nLEFT",

I am now positioned optimally for apples A3 (6, 1) or A4 (6, 3).\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1):\nHead: (1, 3). Length: 10 segments (S1 likely ate an apple last turn).\nBody: [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\nApples collected: 9. S1's head moved from (1, 4) to (1, 3), confirming it ate the apple that was at (1, 3). The new tail is (3, 8) as it grew.\n\nScores: S1 leads 9-7. I must secure an apple this turn.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0)\nA2: (6, 1) - MD from (6, 2): 1 (DOWN)\nA3: (6, 3) - MD from (6, 2): 1 (UP)\nA4: (4, 0) - MD from (6, 2): 2 + 2 = 4\nA5: (2, 6) - MD from (6, 2): 4 + 4 = 8\n\nMy immediate goal is to capture A2 or A3 in 1 move.\n\n**Evaluate Possible Moves from (6, 2)**\n\n| Direction | New Head (X, Y) | Immediate Self/Wall Collision? | S1 Head (1, 3) Collision risk? | Target Apple Captured? | Status |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | (6, 3) | Safe | No | YES (A3) | **Optimal** |\n| DOWN | (6, 1) | Safe | No | YES (A2) | **Optimal** |\n| LEFT | (5, 2) | Safe | No | No | Safe, but delays apple |\n| RIGHT | (7, 2) | Into own body segment (7, 2) | N/A | N/A | **FATAL** (Hitting neck) |\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Both UP and DOWN result in immediate apple consumption.\n\n**Decision: UP vs DOWN**\n\nBoth moves yield an apple and bring the score to 8-9, which is crucial.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3) [A3]:** Captures the apple, grows the snake. (6, 3) is a central location, maintaining good access to the upper board.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1) [A2]:** Captures the apple, grows the snake. (6, 1) is near the edge, potentially leading to less maneuverability if I need to go lower later, but the border is only one step away from the apple (0, 0).\n\nSince both are equally safe and rewarding this turn, I will choose UP (6, 3). Generally, moving higher up the board is preferable as it keeps the snake in a more open space and potentially easier to navigate towards remaining apples (like (2, 6)). Also, the area around (0, 0) and (4, 0) may become contested by S1, so staying higher minimizes immediate conflict.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (S1) Prediction:**\nS1 is at (1, 3). It just ate an apple and is long.\nApples near S1: A1 (0, 0), A4 (4, 0).\nS1's safe moves from (1, 3):\n*   LEFT to (0, 3): Direct path to A1 (0, 0) via (0, 1) or (0, 2).\n*   RIGHT to (2, 3): Moving towards A4 (4, 0).\n*   UP to (1, 4): Into its own body segment (neck). FATAL.\n*   DOWN to (1, 2): Safe, moving away from apples.\n\nS1's most probable target is A4 (4, 0) or potentially looping around to A1 (0, 0).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 3), it is 2 moves away from (4, 0).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (0, 3), it positions itself for (0, 0).\n\nRegardless of S1's move, moving to (6, 3) does not risk a head-on collision, as S1 is far away (MD 5+0 = 5).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to (6, 3) to capture the apple, ensuring the snake grows and remains competitive.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT37: UP (to 6, 3, A3 captured). Score 8-9.\nT38: After T37, I will be at (6, 3). The remaining nearby apples are A4 (4, 0) and A5 (2, 6).\n*   If S1 starts targeting A4 (4, 0), I might move towards A5 (2, 6).\n*   I can move LEFT to (5, 3) or (6, 4) to maintain flexibility. I need to assess S1's position and current length before T38.\n---\n\nUP",

The tail segment is now (3, 5) and will be freed if S1 doesn't eat.*\nBody: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)].\nLength: 10 segments (assuming it didn't eat).\nApples collected: 9.\n\nScores: Tied 9-9.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0) - MD from (6, 5): 6 + 5 = 11\nA2: (6, 1) - MD from (6, 5): 4 (DOWN 4) - **Closest Apple**\nA3: (4, 0) - MD from (6, 5): 2 + 5 = 7\nA4: (2, 6) - MD from (6, 5): 4 + 1 = 5\nA5: (7, 3) - MD from (6, 5): 1 + 2 = 3 (closer in X/Y but less direct safe route than A2)\n\n**Goal:** Secure the next apple, A2 (6, 1) or A4 (2, 6).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from (6, 5)**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the center/top edge.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** Hitting my neck segment. **FATAL.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe. Moves slightly towards A4 (2, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe. Moves slightly towards A5 (7, 3).\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Detailed Move Strategy**\n\nMy closest apple is A2 (6, 1), 4 moves straight down. This path appears completely safe from myself and the enemy snake S1, which is on the left side of the board.\n\n*   If I move UP to (6, 6), I move away from all three apples (A2, A3, A5) and only slightly closer to A4 (2, 6).\n*   If I move LEFT to (5, 5), I start moving towards A4 (2, 6). Distance to A4 is 5.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I move towards A5 (7, 3). Distance to A5 is 3.\n\nLet's prioritize the most isolated and direct path, which is A2 (6, 1).\n\nPath to A2 (6, 1):\nT40: (6, 5) -> (7, 5) or (5, 5) is inefficient. I should move towards the Y=1 line.\n\nWait, the move RIGHT to (7, 5) is the most efficient way to access A5 (7, 3). A5 is only 3 Manhattan distance away!\n\nPath to A5 (7, 3):\nT40: (6, 5) -> RIGHT to (7, 5) (Distance 2 to A5)\nT41: (7, 5) -> DOWN to (7, 4) (Distance 1 to A5)\nT42: (7, 4) -> DOWN to (7, 3) (EAT A5).\n\nPath to A2 (6, 1):\nT40: (6, 5) -> (5, 5) or (7, 5) would be lateral. I need to move DOWN but (6, 4) is my body. This means I must move laterally *now* to free up the (6, 4) segment so I can move down straight later.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5):\nMy body shifts: (6, 4) becomes head-relative to (7, 5). The segment (6, 4) is now available next turn if I move back to (6, 5). But that is inefficient.\nIf I pursue A5 (7, 3) with RIGHT:\nMy head is at (7, 5). My body is [(6, 5), (6, 4), ...].\nNext turn, I can move DOWN to (7, 4). (7, 5) -> (7, 4) is safe.\n\nLet's compare A5 (7, 3) and A4 (2, 6).\nA5 (7, 3) MD=3. Access: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN.\nA4 (2, 6) MD=5. Access: LEFT, UP, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN or similar winding path.\n\nThe path to A5 (7, 3) is very direct and looks safe from S1, whose current head is (3, 4).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (S1) Analysis (3, 4)**\n\nS1 Head: (3, 4). Neck: (2, 4).\nS1's safe moves:\n1. UP to (3, 5): Hitting its own body (tail segment). FATAL if tail doesn't move, but tail *is* (3, 5) which is freed, so this is SAFE. Moves towards A4 (2, 6) or towards the top.\n2. DOWN to (3, 3): Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, potential conflict with A3 (4, 0).\n3. LEFT to (2, 4): Hitting its neck. FATAL. (Wait, S1's body is [(2, 4), (2, 3), ...]. Moving to (2, 4) hits its own neck. FATAL.)\n4. RIGHT to (4, 4): Safe. Moves closer to me (6, 5).\n\nS1 is likely aiming for A4 (2, 6) or A5 (7, 3). A4 (2, 6) MD=2 for S1 if it moves UP to (3, 5) then LEFT to (2, 5). Wait, MD from (3, 4) to (2, 6) is 1 + 2 = 3.\nIf S1 goes UP to (3, 5), it is 1 move. Then (3, 5) to (2, 6) is 1 LEFT, 1 UP. Total 3 moves to A4.\n\nIf S1 goes RIGHT to (4, 4), it moves toward A5 (7, 3). MD from (4, 4) to (7, 3) is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nS1's preference should be A4 (2, 6). If S1 moves UP to (3, 5), it captures its tail and sets up for A4.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), S1 moving UP to (3, 5) poses no threat. S1 moving RIGHT to (4, 4) poses no immediate threat either, as the distance remains 3 tiles.\n\n**Decision: Move RIGHT towards A5 (7, 3)**\n\nThis path is short (3 moves) and isolated on the right side of the board, minimizing immediate conflict with S1 who is still concentrated on the left.\n\nThe safe move RIGHT to (7, 5) will set me up perfectly for the next two DOWN moves.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT40: RIGHT to (7, 5). Set up for A5 (7, 3).\nT41: DOWN to (7, 4).\nT42: DOWN to (7, 3). EAT A5.\n\nRIGHT",

I am now adjacent to A5.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from (7, 4)**\n\nNeck segment: (7, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 5):** Hitting my neck segment. **FATAL.** (Moving backwards).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** EAT A5.

No head-on collision or collision with my tail (which is at (9, 3) and thus not blocking (7, 3)). Given S1's long tail, it is likely continuing toward A3 (4, 0) or maneuvering on the left half of the board.\n\n*   S1 moves to (4, 2): No conflict.\n*   S1 moves to (3, 3): No conflict.\n*   S1 moves to (5, 3): No conflict.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 3) is safe and guarantees an apple, breaking the tie score.\n\n**Post-A5 Strategy (After eating at T42)**\n\nMy snake will be at (7, 3) and length 11.\nNext apples are A2 (6, 1) (MD=3) or A4 (2, 6) (MD=7). A2 is much closer.\n\nT43 path towards A2 (6, 1):\nFrom (7, 3):\nLEFT to (6, 3). (My body currently occupies (6, 3), this spot is freed *if I do not eat* this turn, but since I am eating, (7, 5) is freed, not (6, 3)).\nWait, let's re-examine my body segments:\nHead (7, 4)\nBody: (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3) Tail.\nIf I eat at (7, 3), my new body is: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3).\nThe path: (7, 3) -> LEFT to (6, 3) is hitting my 6th segment. **FATAL.**\n\nMust go around (6, 3) and (6, 2).\nPath to A2 (6, 1) from (7, 3):\n1. UP to (7, 4). (Hitting body). **FATAL.**\n2. RIGHT to (8, 3). Safe path open down the right side.\n3. DOWN to (7, 2). (My body segment). **FATAL.**\n\nI must move RIGHT to (8, 3) to maneuver away from my dense body structure (7, 4 to 9, 3).\n\nT43: Move RIGHT to (8, 3).\nT44: Move DOWN to (8, 2) (My body segment). **FATAL.**\n\nThe body structure near (7, 3) is highly complex.\n(7, 3)\n(7, 2) is occupied.\n(6, 3) is occupied.\n(8, 3) is free.\n(7, 4) is occupied.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3) at T43:\nNew Head: (8, 3). Neck: (7, 3).\nThe safe path is likely:\n(7, 3) -> RIGHT (8, 3) -> DOWN (8, 2) is blocked. -> RIGHT (9, 3) is blocked.\n\nThe board status shows:\n 9 T . . .\n 8 . . . .\n 7 . T . A\n 6 . T . .\n 5 T T . .\n 4 . . . .\n 3 . . . T\n 2 . . . T\n 1 . A . .\n\nLet's re-verify my body structure *after* eating at T42 (7, 3):\nH: (7, 3)\n1: (7, 4)\n2: (7, 5)\n3: (6, 5)\n4: (6, 4)\n5: (6, 3)\n6: (6, 2)\n7: (7, 2)\n8: (8, 2)\n9: (9, 2)\n10: (9, 3) (Tail, remains fixed)\n\nFrom H (7, 3):\nUP (7, 4): Body (1). **FATAL.**\nDOWN (7, 2): Body (7). **FATAL.**\nLEFT (6, 3): Body (5). **FATAL.**\nRIGHT (8, 3): FREE. **SAFE.** (This is the only open escape path).\n\nSo the 3-turn plan to A2 (6, 1) is:\nT42: DOWN to (7, 3). EAT A5. (Length 11).\nT43: RIGHT to (8, 3). (Must escape the trap).\nT44: DOWN to (8, 2) - This cell (8, 2) is my 8th segment. **FATAL.**\n\nThis shows a severe trap. I must use the *future* tail position for calculation.\nIf I *don't* eat, tail (9, 3) becomes free. But I *am* eating. Tail remains at (9, 3).\n\nWait, the board visualization shows T (my body) at (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3). My head is at (7, 4). (7, 3) is A.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 3) (Eat):\nNew body: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3).\n\nNext turn (T43) from (7, 3). Safe move must be (8, 3).\nAt T44, (9, 3) is the new tail position. This is NOT freed if I ate at T42.\n\nIf I move from (8, 3) at T44:\nUP (8, 4): Safe.\nDOWN (8, 2): Body (8). **FATAL.**\nLEFT (7, 3): Body (0, neck). **FATAL.**\nRIGHT (9, 3): Body (10, tail). **FATAL.**\n\nThis means moving right at T43 will trap me at (8, 3) unless S1 happens to block my path back into the center (unlikely).\n\nAlternative: Re-evaluate A2 (6, 1).\nFrom (7, 3):\nIf I survive two non-eating moves (T43, T44), my tail (9, 3) and (9, 2) will free up.\n\nIf I prioritize survival over the next apple:\nT42: DOWN to (7, 3). EAT A5.\nT43: RIGHT to (8, 3). (Necessary escape).\nT44: UP to (8, 4). (Keeps me safe, frees (9, 3)). My new tail is (9, 2).\nT45: Move toward A2 (6, 1). This is complicated.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: Eating A5. It is safe and guarantees an apple. Survival planning is for T43.\n\n**Short-term plan for subsequent turns (T43 onwards):**\n1. EAT A5 at (7, 3).\n2. Move RIGHT to (8, 3) to escape the immediate enclosure created by my long body grid (6,x, 7,x).\n3. From (8, 3), move UP to (8, 4) to buy time and let the tail segments (9, 3, 9, 2) free up, allowing access to the bottom right quadrant to loop back towards A2 (6, 1).\n\nThe immediate move is clear and critical: take the apple.\n\nDOWN\n**START LONG RATIONALE**\nTurn: 42 / 150\n\n**Current State Analysis and Objective**\nThe snake is at (7, 4), positioned exactly one move away from Apple A5 at (7, 3). The plan was to move DOWN to secure this apple, which would break the current score tie (9-9).\n\n**Safety Check for DOWN to (7, 3)**\n1.  **Board Boundaries:** (7, 3) is within the 10x10 grid. Safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Neck is (7, 5). Moving to (7, 3) is not moving backward. No body segments besides the apple are at (7, 3). Safe.\n3.  **Enemy Collision:** S1 is currently at (4, 3), far away. Even if S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 3), there is no conflict. Safe.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe and results in eating A5.\n\n**Post-Move Strategy (T43 Planning)**\nEating at (7, 3) significantly lengthens the snake (L=11) and makes the surrounding area extremely restrictive:\n*   (7, 4) (Neck/Body 1)\n*   (7, 2) (Body 7)\n*   (6, 3) (Body 5)\n*   (8, 2) (Body 8)\n*   (9, 3) (Tail 10)\n\nThe only adjacent safe escape route from (7, 3) is RIGHT to (8, 3). Any other move is immediately fatal due to self-collision. Therefore, the long-term plan must account for this necessary escape maneuver at T43:\n1.  T42: DOWN to (7, 3) (Eat A5).\n2.  T43: RIGHT to (8, 3) (Escape).\n3.  T44: UP to (8, 4) (Safety maneuver allowing tail segments (9, 3 and 9, 2) to free up, enabling a turn down the right edge towards A2 (6, 1) or other targets).\n\nThe immediate move is DOWN.\n**END LONG RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

(Assuming S1 moved DOWN from (4, 3) towards A3 (4, 0)).\nLength: 10 segments.\nBody: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5)].\nApples collected: 9.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0) - MD from (7, 3): 7 + 3 = 10\nA2: (6, 1) - MD from (7, 3): 1 + 2 = 3 (Closest)\nA3: (4, 0) - MD from (7, 3): 3 + 3 = 6\nA4: (2, 6) - MD from (7, 3): 5 + 3 = 8\nA5: (6, 7) - MD from (7, 3): 1 + 4 = 5\n\nThe closest target is A2 (6, 1). However, my snake is currently trapped by its own body, which is very dense around (7, 3).\n\nMy immediate body segments are:\nUP (7, 4): Body (1). **FATAL.**\nDOWN (7, 2): Body (8). **FATAL.**\nLEFT (6, 3): Body (5). **FATAL.**\nRIGHT (8, 3): **FREE.**\n\n**Evaluation of Moves from (7, 3)**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** Collision with my neck/body 1. **FATAL.**\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Collision with my body segment 8. **FATAL.**\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** Collision with my body segment 5. **FATAL.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe and open. This is the only survival move.\n\n**Collision Check (Primary Target: RIGHT to (8, 3))**\n\n*   My new head position: (8, 3).\n*   S1 Head moves from (4, 2). S1's plausible safe moves are:\n    *   DOWN to (4, 1): Towards A3 (4, 0).\n    *   LEFT to (3, 2): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (5, 2): Safe.\n    *   UP to (4, 3): Hitting neck. **FATAL.**\n\nNo path for S1 leads close to (8, 3) this turn. The move is safe from external collision.\n\n**T44 Strategy (After moving to (8, 3))**\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3), my body configuration at T44 will be:\nH: (8, 3)\n1: (7, 3)\n2: (7, 4)\n3: (7, 5)\n...\n10: (9, 2)\n11: (9, 3) (Tail, remains fixed since I ate at T42).\n\nFrom (8, 3), I check for safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):** Safe. Allows access to the top half of the board or positioning for later maneuvers.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):** Body segment 9. **FATAL.**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):** My neck/body 1. **FATAL.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):** My tail segment 11. **FATAL.**\n\nMoving UP to (8, 4) at T44 is the only safe option. This confirms that moving RIGHT now is essential for survival.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe current situation demands a life-saving move to (8, 3). While this moves me slightly away from the closest apple (6, 1) in Manhattan Distance, it is the only safe escape route given the dense cluster of my body adjacent to (7, 3).\n\n**Long-term plan recap:**\nT43: RIGHT to (8, 3) (Escape trap).\nT44: UP to (8, 4) (Maneuver to free tail).\nT45: Move LEFT toward the center or further UP to target A5 (6, 7) or loop down towards A2 (6, 1) once the congestion clears.\n\nRIGHT",

(Successfully moved RIGHT to escape the trap).\nLength: 11 segments.\nBody: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)].\nTail: (9, 2). *Tails moves to (9, 3).* Wait, wait. I grew at T42/43.\nLet's re-verify the body movement from my previous state at T43:\nT43 Head: (7, 3). Body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), **(9, 3)**]. (The body list provided in the prompt for T43 was slightly different, but the body list provided for T44 is the source of truth).\n\nCurrent T44 state as given:\nHead: (8, 3)\nBody (Head-to-Tail): (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2).\nLength: 11 segments.\nTail position: (9, 2). Since I did not eat an apple on the last turn (T43), the tail (9, 2) *will* move this turn, freeing that square.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1):\nHead: (4, 1). (Assuming S1 moved DOWN from (4, 2) towards A3 (4, 0)).\nLength: 10 segments.\nBody: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4)].\nTail position: (0, 4). Tail moves to (0, 5).\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (0, 0) - MD from (8, 3): 8 + 3 = 11\nA2: (6, 1) - MD from (8, 3): 2 + 2 = 4 (Closest)\nA3: (4, 0) - MD from (8, 3): 4 + 3 = 7\nA4: (2, 6) - MD from (8, 3): 6 + 3 = 9\nA5: (6, 7) - MD from (8, 3): 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThe closest apple is A2 (6, 1). Snake 1 is likely heading towards A3 (4, 0) or A2 (6, 1). Given its current position (4, 1), A3 is closer for S1 (MD 1) than A2 (MD 3).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from (8, 3)**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   Safe from border.\n    *   Safe from my body: (7, 3) is neck, (8, 2) or (8, 4) is free. (8, 4) is free.\n    *   Safe from S1: S1 is far away.\n    *   *Result:* Safe. This helps me exit the compressed area.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   Collision with my body segment $(8, 2)$. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   Collision with my neck segment $(7, 3)$. **FATAL.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   Safe from border.\n    *   (9, 3) is free. My tail (9, 2) moves to (9, 3) this turn if I don't eat. If I move to (9, 3), I collide with my body segment that occupies (9, 3) *after* the move.\n    *   Wait, the body segments listed are: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2).\n    *   (9, 3) is currently empty. The tail is (9, 2). If I move right to (9, 3), the tail (9, 2) moves *off* the board, and the segment currently at (9, 2) is vacated.\n    *   (9, 3) is free. (9, 2) is the current tail, which moves (i.e., vanishes) unless I eat. Since (9, 3) is not in my body list, this move is safe regarding my own body.\n    *   *Result:* Safe.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves: UP (8, 4) vs. RIGHT (9, 3)**\n\nTarget A2 is at (6, 1). To get there, I need to move LEFT and DOWN.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   Positions me along the edge (x=9). This is generally restrictive, making it harder to navigate back towards the center or A2 (6, 1).\n    *   Future options from (9, 3): UP to (9, 4) (safe), DOWN to (9, 2 - if tail moves, which it does) (safe), LEFT to (8, 3 - neck) (fatal). Limited maneuvers.\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   Positions me more centrally and opens up the board.\n    *   From (8, 4), I can move: LEFT to (7, 4) (neck, fatal), UP to (8, 5) (safe), RIGHT to (9, 4) (safe), DOWN to (8, 3) (neck, fatal).\n    *   If I move to (8, 4), I can try to loop around the density of my own body (7, 5), (6, 5) to reach A5 (6, 7) or loop down towards A2 (6, 1).\n\nThe prior move (RIGHT) put me at (8, 3) primarily for survival. Now that I am safe, I want to re-establish a path towards an apple. A2 (6, 1) or A5 (6, 7) are reasonable targets.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 4) gives me more freedom than moving RIGHT to (9, 3). If I move UP, I am closer to a path leading LEFT towards the center of the board, allowing me to decide whether to pursue A5 (top) or navigate the complex paths towards A2 (bottom left).\n\nLet's look at the constraints for reaching A2 (6, 1) from (8, 4). I would need to go roughly (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5) [Wait, (7, 5) is body] -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 5) [Wait, (6, 5) is body]. This suggests navigating down the right side of my body segments (7, 5) and (6, 5) is highly complex and probably dead-ending.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 4):\nT45 options: (8, 5) or (9, 4).\nIf I choose (8, 5), I have access to (7, 5) (FATAL) and (9, 5) (SAFE).\n\nThe cluster of my body is around (6, 3) to (7, 5). Moving high and wide seems better.\n(8, 3) -> UP (8, 4)\n(8, 4) -> UP (8, 5)\n(8, 5) -> LEFT (7, 5) (FATAL) or UP (8, 6) or RIGHT (9, 5).\n\nSince I am on the right side of the board, going UP maximizes my flexibility. The apple A5 (6, 7) is also easily accessible if I choose to go higher.\n\nTarget A5 (6, 7) MD 6:\n(8, 3) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7). This looks like a viable, safe path in general, assuming no S1 interference.\n\nLet's check S1's likely move. S1 is at (4, 1). Likely moves:\n1. DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple A3). Highly probable.\n2. LEFT to (3, 1). Safe, but away from apples.\n3. RIGHT to (5, 1). Safe, but away from apples.\nS1 will prioritize (4, 0). If S1 gets (4, 0), it will grow, and its tail (0, 4) will remain.\n\nS1's movement does not constrain my move selection between UP and RIGHT. UP (8, 4) provides a better long-term maneuvering space than RIGHT (9, 3). I want to target A5 (6, 7) or circle back for A2 (6, 1) once the center density clears.\n\n**Conclusion:** UP is the preferred safe move to gain maneuverability and access to the upper side of the board, making A5 a viable target.\n\n**T45/T46 Long-term plan (if UP to (8, 4))**\nT45: UP to (8, 5).\nT46: LEFT to (7, 5) or UP to (8, 6). (7, 5) is still occupied by segment 3. Must continue UP or RIGHT. (8, 6).\nT47: Start moving LEFT/DOWN towards A5 (6, 7).\n\nUP",

This was the target identified in the previous turn.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from (8, 5)**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):**\n    *   Safe from border (9 > 6 > 0).\n    *   Safe from my body: (8, 6) is free.\n    *   (8, 6) is an apple (A5).

This is the optimal move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    *   Collision with my neck segment $(8, 4)$. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Collision with segment $(7, 5)$. **FATAL.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    *   Safe from border.\n    *   Safe from my body.\n    *   Safe from S1.\n    *   *Result:* Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n\n**Enemy Snake S1 Movement Prediction**\n\nS1 Head is at (5, 0).\nS1 potential moves:\n* UP to (5, 1): Safe. Moves closer to A2 (6, 1) or potentially A4 (6, 7). MD to A2: 1 move.\n* DOWN to (5, -1): Border collision. Dead.\n* LEFT to (4, 0): Collision with neck segment (4, 0). Dead.\n* RIGHT to (6, 0): Safe.\nS1 is likely to move UP to (5, 1) to target A2 (6, 1), which is 2 moves away.\n\nMy move UP to (8, 6) is completely safe from S1, as S1 cannot reach (8, 6) this turn or the next.\n\n**Strategic Choice**\n\nThe move UP to (8, 6) secures an apple, increasing my score to 11 and lengthening my snake to 12 segments. This gives me a score lead again.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating A5 (8, 6), my head will be at (8, 6) and my length 12.\nThe next closest apples are A4 (6, 7) (MD 2) and A2 (6, 1) (MD 6).\nS1 is likely moving towards the lower apples (A2 or A1). If S1 goes to (5, 1), A2 (6, 1) is likely its next target.\nIf S1 reaches A2 (6, 1) at T47 (from (5, 1) -> (6, 1), assuming S1 moves RIGHT or diagonally somehow, but S1 cannot move diagonally, so (5, 1) -> (6, 1) is 1 move), S1 will eat it.\nAh, S1 is at (5, 0). If S1 moves UP to (5, 1), A2 (6, 1) is 1 RIGHT move away. So S1 can reach A2 at T47.\n\nI am at (8, 6).\nIf I target A4 (6, 7): (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7). Takes 3 moves.\nI cannot reach A4 (6, 7) before S1 reaches A2 (6, 1).\n\nHowever, I should prioritize controlling the center/top area. A4 (6, 7) is my best immediate target after A5.\n\nT46: Move UP to (8, 6) (Eat A5).\nT47: Move LEFT towards A4 (6, 7). (Options: (7, 6) or (8, 7)). Given the setup, (8, 7) is often better for flexibility, followed by (7, 7) or (7, 6).\nLet's plan for a general move toward the cluster of apples (A4, A3).\n\nChosen move: UP.\n\nUP",

The body listed above must be updated based on S1's move from (5, 0) to (6, 0).\nS1 T46 actual body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3)].\nS1 T47 body (after move to (6, 0)): [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3)]. New tail vacated is (1, 3).\n*Wait, the provided current state data reflects the board state and snake positions *after* the move. So, S1 Head is (6, 0), and its body segments follow. The provided body list for S1 is correct for the current state.*\n\nApples left:\nA1: (0, 0) - MD from (8, 6): 8 + 6 = 14\nA2: (6, 1) - MD from (8, 6): 2 + 5 = 7\nA3: (2, 6) - MD from (8, 6): 6 + 0 = 6 (Closest)\nA4: (6, 7) - MD from (8, 6): 2 + 1 = 3 (Second Closest)\nA5: (8, 1) - MD from (8, 6): 0 + 5 = 5\n\nMy current priority is A4 (6, 7) and A3 (2, 6). A4 is closer, but A3 is on the same Y-level as my head.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from My Head (8, 6)**\n\nMy occupied cells include: (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2).\n*Note: (7, 2) is still occupied as I grew last turn.*\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   Safe from border (Y=7 is fine).\n    *   Safe from my body (8, 7) is clear.\n    *   Safe from S1: S1 is at (6, 0) and is moving away from this area.\n    *   *Result:* Safe open space. This move helps position me for A4 (6, 7) or general movement flexibility.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   Collision with my neck segment (8, 5). **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Safe from border.\n    *   Safe from my body (7, 6) is clear.\n    *   Safe from S1.\n    *   *Result:* Safe and moves directly towards A3 (2, 6) and A4 (6, 7).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   Safe from border.\n    *   Safe from my body.\n    *   Safe from S1.\n    *   *Result:* Safe, but moves away from all immediate apple targets (except possibly winding down towards A5 (8, 1)). This is generally defensive/less optimal.\n\n**Strategic Comparison: UP (8, 7) vs. LEFT (7, 6)**\n\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 6):** MD to A4 (6, 7) becomes 1 + 1 = 2 (via (6, 6) or (7, 7)). MD to A3 (2, 6) becomes 5. This is a very direct path towards the cluster (A3, A4).\n*   **Move UP (8, 7):** MD to A4 (6, 7) becomes 2 + 0 = 2 (via (7, 7) -> (6, 7) or (8, 8) -> long path). Wait, getting to (6, 7) from (8, 7) requires 2 moves: (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 7).\n    *   From (7, 6): (7, 6) -> (6, 6) or (7, 7). If (7, 7), then (6, 7) is 2 moves total. If (6, 6), then (6, 7) is 2 moves total.\n\nBoth UP (to 8, 7) and LEFT (to 7, 6) lead to A4 (6, 7) in 2 subsequent moves.\n\nLet's look at the area:\n(8, 7) allows immediate freedom to move DOWN (to 8, 6, which is now open) or LEFT (to 7, 7).\n(7, 6) allows immediate freedom to move UP (to 7, 7) or LEFT (to 6, 6).\n\n(7, 6) is 3 units from the body mass below it (segments at y=5, y=3). (8, 7) is 4 units from the body mass. (7, 6) feels slightly more restrictive, but targets A3 (2, 6) more directly if A4 is blocked.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 6, 0)**\n\nS1 is currently positioned very close to A2 (6, 1).\nS1 T47 options from (6, 0):\n* UP to (6, 1): EATS A2. MD=1. This is the most likely move.\n* DOWN to (6, -1): DEAD.\n* LEFT to (5, 0): Neck collision. DEAD.\n* RIGHT to (7, 0): Safe, but away from all apples except A1 (0, 0) eventually, or A5 (8, 1). Less likely.\n\nWe must assume S1 moves UP to (6, 1) and eats A2 this turn. This means S1 hits 11 apples, and my lead remains 1. (11 vs 11).\n\n**Target Re-assessment**\n\nIf S1 eats A2 (6, 1), the remaining apples are A1 (0, 0), A3 (2, 6), A4 (6, 7), A5 (8, 1).\nA4 (6, 7) is MD 3 away, A3 (2, 6) is MD 6 away. A5 (8, 1) is MD 5 away.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 6):\nT48 options: UP (7, 7), LEFT (6, 6), DOWN (7, 5 - collision!), RIGHT (8, 6 - collision!).\nWait, (7, 5) is part of my body. Moving DOWN to (7, 5) kills me.\nTherefore, the LEFT move to (7, 6) severely limits my T48 options: only UP (7, 7) or LEFT (6, 6) are safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 7):\nT48 options: UP (8, 8), LEFT (7, 7), RIGHT (9, 7), DOWN (8, 6 - previous head location, now free). 4 safe moves.\nThis move is significantly safer and keeps flexibility.\n\n**Plan based on UP move to (8, 7):**\nI prioritize maintaining open space and flexibility, especially since the travel time to A4 (6, 7) is the same (2 subsequent moves).\n\nT47: Move UP to (8, 7).\nT48: I will be at (8, 7). To get to (6, 7), I need to move LEFT to (7, 7).\nT49: Move LEFT to (6, 7) (Eat A4). Length 13.\n\nThis path seems safe and optimized for the highest remaining apple, A4. S1 is unlikely to contest A4 given its current position far below.\n\n**Final Check:**\nMove: UP to (8, 7).\nSafety: Confirmed safe from borders, own body, and enemy collision.\nGoal: Secure A4 (6, 7) in T49.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T48+):**\nT48: Move LEFT to (7, 7).\nT49: Move LEFT to (6, 7) (Eat A4).\nAfter eating A4, the remaining apples in the top area are A3 (2, 6). I will then navigate from (6, 7) towards A3 (2, 6).\n\nUP",

The previous turn's rationale assumed S1 would move to (6, 1) and eat A2. Since 'Apples at (2, 6)' etc. are listed, and no apple is currently at (6, 1), S1 *must* have eaten an apple to grow to length 12.)\n\nApples at:\nA1: (0, 0) - MD from (8, 7): 8 + 7 = 15\nA2: (2, 6) - MD from (8, 7): 6 + 1 = 7\nA3: (6, 7) - MD from (8, 7): 2 + 0 = 2 (Closest, target from last turn's plan)\nA4: (8, 1) - MD from (8, 7): 0 + 6 = 6\nA5: (5, 5) - MD from (8, 7): 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTarget: A3 (6, 7). This apple is 2 Manhattan distance away, and based on the plan from T47, I aim to reach (6, 7) in the next turn (T49).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from My Head (8, 7)**\n\nMy occupied cells: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2).\n*Note: (6, 2) will be vacated this turn if I don't eat an apple.*\n\n1. **UP to (8, 8):**\n    * Safe from border (Y=8 is fine).\n    * Safe from self/enemy.\n    * Opens up movement options.\n    * MD to (6, 7) increases to 4 (e.g., (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7)). This delays reaching the closest apple. **Not preferred.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 6):**\n    * Safe from border.\n    * (8, 6) is my neck segment. Collision. **FATAL.** (Wait, I just moved from (8, 6) to (8, 7) and did not eat. (8, 6) is now the second segment of my body, so collision is fatal.)\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 7):**\n    * Safe from border.\n    * Safe from self/enemy.\n    * Path towards A3 (6, 7): Next move could be (6, 7) to eat. **Highly preferred.**\n    * MD to (6, 7) becomes 1.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    * Safe from border.\n    * Safe from self/enemy.\n    * Moves away from all immediate targets. **Not preferred.**\n\n**Optimal Move: LEFT (to 7, 7)**\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 7) sets me up perfectly to consume A3 (6, 7) on the following turn (T49).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 6, 1)**\n\nS1 is at (6, 1). Apples remaining nearby: A4 (8, 1), A5 (5, 5).\nS1 options from (6, 1):\n* UP to (6, 2): (6, 2) is my tail segment, which will be vacated this turn (since I did not eat). This is a safe and strategic move for S1, moving towards the center/A5.\n* DOWN to (6, 0): Collision with neck segment (6, 0). **FATAL.**\n* LEFT to (5, 1): Safe. Moves towards A5 (5, 5).\n* RIGHT to (7, 1): Safe. Moves towards A4 (8, 1).\n\nIf S1 moves to (6, 2) or (5, 1) or (7, 1), none of these moves interfere with my path to A3 (6, 7) immediately. S1 is reasonably likely to choose (6, 2) to increase central flexibility or (7, 1) to target A4 (8, 1).\n\nCrucially, S1 is far away from A3 (6, 7). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMoving LEFT guarantees I reach the apple at (6, 7) next turn, which is the closest apple and ensures I maintain or regain the lead.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nT48: Move LEFT to (7, 7).\nT49: Move LEFT to (6, 7) and EAT apple A3. Length 13.\nT50: From (6, 7), I will assess my path to A2 (2, 6) or A5 (5, 5), depending on enemy movement. A5 (5, 5) seems closer/easier to reach from (6, 7).\n\nLEFT",

It is impossible for S1 to collide with me at (6, 7) this turn.\n\n**Optimal Move: LEFT**\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 7, 1)**\n\nS1 is at (7, 1), targeting A4 (8, 1) or potentially A5 (5, 5).\nPossible moves for S1:\n* UP to (7, 2): Safe. Moves towards A5 (5, 5) or A2 (2, 6).\n* DOWN to (7, 0): Safe. Moves away from apples.\n* LEFT to (6, 1): Collision with neck segment (6, 1). **FATAL.**\n* RIGHT to (8, 1): Safe.

My length 13. S1 likely eats A4 at (8, 1).\nT50: Head at (6, 7). Closest apples are A5 (5, 5) [MD 1+2=3] and A2 (2, 6) [MD 4+1=5]. Given A5 is in the middle and slightly closer, I should target (5, 5). Target path: DOWN to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 7) then DOWN to (5, 6) or (5, 5). Going DOWN to (6, 6) seems like a good start. Need to consider S1's position at (8, 1) and its likely subsequent moves towards A5 or A2.\n\nLEFT",

Collision. **FATAL.**\n\nThe optimal move is clearly LEFT to eat A5 (5, 7).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 8, 1)**\n\nS1 is at (8, 1). It is relatively far from the remaining apples cluster (2, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), which are all on the left/center of the board.\nA2 (2, 6) MD: 6 + 5 = 11\nA3 (5, 5) MD: 3 + 4 = 7\nA4 (5, 6) MD: 3 + 5 = 8\nA5 (5, 7) MD: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nS1's immediate accessible options:\n* UP to (8, 2): Safe.

Moves towards the edge, away from apples.\n\nS1's best move is likely UP to (8, 2) to prepare for a move towards A3 (5, 5) or A2 (2, 6). The MD to A3 (5, 5) from (8, 2) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThere is no collision risk since S1 is 8 distance steps away from my intended target (5, 7).\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to seize apple A5 (5, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT50: Move LEFT to (5, 7) and EAT A5. My length 14. S1 likely moves UP to (8, 2).\nT51: Head at (5, 7). Closest apples are A4 (5, 6) [MD 1] and A3 (5, 5) [MD 2]. I must move DOWN to (5, 6) to eat A4. This is a crucial move as it continues the streak and occupies a strategic central column.\nT52: Head at (5, 6). Next target is A3 (5, 5) [MD 1]. Move DOWN to eat A3.\nMy goal is to clear out this centralized cluster of apples (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5) fast before S1 can maneuver across the board.

Moves away from apples.\n\nS1 is likely to move UP to (8, 3) or LEFT to (7, 2) to continue its pursuit of the central apples.\n\n* If S1 moves UP to (8, 3): MD to A3 is 5.\n* If S1 moves LEFT to (7, 2): MD to A3 is 6.\n\nLet's assume S1 moves UP, as this keeps the path open longer.\n\n**Collision Check**\nMy intended move is (5, 7) -> (5, 6).\nS1's likely move is (8, 2) -> (8, 3).\nNo immediate risk of head-to-head collision or body collision. I am safe to proceed with the optimal move.\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN to eat A4 (5, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT51: Move DOWN to (5, 6), EAT A4. My length 15.

Not as useful as LEFT or DOWN.\n\nThe best move is clearly DOWN to eat the closest apple at (5, 5).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 9, 2)**\n\nS1 is at (9, 2). This move (RIGHT) put S1 on the edge. S1 has two apples on the board edge/corner: A1 (0, 0) and A5 (8, 9).\n\nFrom (9, 2):\n* UP to (9, 3): Safe.\n* DOWN to (9, 1): Safe.\n* LEFT to (8, 2): S1's neck. **FATAL.**\n* RIGHT to (10, 2): Border. **FATAL.**\n\nS1 must move UP or DOWN. Since S1 is at the bottom right corner, moving UP (towards A5 (8, 9)) or DOWN (just circling) are the options. Moving UP to (9, 3) seems most logical if it is still apple-seeking. A5 (8, 9) is MD 4 moves away. A1 (0, 0) is MD 11 moves away.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 3): No conflict with my move (5, 5).\n\nS1 may also try to go for A1 (0, 0), perhaps moving downwards and then sweeping the bottom edge, but that seems extremely slow.\n\nLet's assume S1 moves UP to (9, 3) or DOWN to (9, 1). Neither move affects my optimal choice of DOWN.\n\n**Collision Check**\nMy intended move is (5, 6) -> (5, 5) (EAT).\nS1 is likely moving (9, 2) -> (9, 3) or (9, 1).\nNo head-to-head collision risk. No body collision risk. My path is clear and optimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT52: Move DOWN to (5, 5), EAT A3. My length 16. S1 likely moves UP/DOWN along X=9 boundary.\nT53: Head at (5, 5).

Note: (4, 4) is S1's tail and will vacate this turn if S1 doesn't eat.\n\n1. **UP to (5, 6):**\n    * (5, 6) is my neck segment.

MD to A2 increases (4 + 1 = 5).\n    * Moves towards S1's body segments (4, 4), (4, 3), which are right below. This path is generally restrictive.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    * Safe from border.\n    * (4, 5) is currently clear.\n    * Moves towards A2 (2, 6). VMD to A2: 1 + 3 = 4. MD remains 4 (optimal path).\n    * Excellent trajectory for approaching A2 (2, 6).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    * (6, 5) is my body segment. Collision. **FATAL.**\n\nOnly safe, non-suicidal moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\nComparing DOWN to (5, 4) vs. LEFT to (4, 5):\nLEFT (4, 5) moves directly towards the most desirable apple (2, 6) and keeps me central.\nDOWN (5, 4) moves away from (2, 6) and closer to the congested area where S1's body lies (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), etc.\n\nTherefore, LEFT to (4, 5) is the best move.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S1 Head at 9, 3)**\n\nS1 is at (9, 3).\nS1 body segments: (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)... (4, 4). S1 tail (4, 4) vacates.\n\nSafe moves for S1:\n* UP to (9, 4): Safe. Moves far from current apples, unless aiming for (8, 9).\n* DOWN to (9, 2): S1's neck. FATAL.\n* LEFT to (8, 3): Safe. Good direction if aiming for central area/A2, but still far.\n* RIGHT to (10, 3): Border. FATAL.\n\nIf S1 seeks A5 (8, 9), it might move LEFT to (8, 3) and then UP. MD to A5 (8, 9) is 1 + 6 = 7.\nIf S1 seeks A5 via the top edge, it might move UP to (9, 4). MD to A5 is 1 + 5 = 6. (9, 4) is closer to A5.\n\nIf S1 moves to (9, 4) or (8, 3), it does not interfere with my move to (4, 5).\n\nSince I am moving LEFT to (4, 5), and S1 is operating on the right side of the board, there is no collision risk.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT53: Move LEFT to (4, 5). Aim for A2 (2, 6).\nT54: Head at (4, 5). Move LEFT to (3, 5).\nT55: Head at (3, 5). Move UP to (3, 6).\nT56: Head at (3, 6). Move LEFT or UP depending on accessibility of (2, 6). Likely LEFT to (2, 6). EAT A2. My length 17.\n\nLEFT",

Excellent path.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    * (5, 5) is my neck segment (second segment in body list). Collision. **FATAL.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5). Both UP and LEFT reduce distance to A2 (2, 6) to 2.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. LEFT**\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 6):** Future moves could be LEFT to (3, 6) then LEFT to (2, 6) [Eat], or UP to (4, 7) (moving away temporarily), or DOWN to (4, 5) (suicidal reverse, or slow). (4, 6) is a good location.\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 5):** Future moves could be UP to (3, 6) then LEFT to (2, 6) [Eat], or LEFT to (2, 5) (moving perpendicular to apple). (3, 5) is a great location for approach.\n\nBoth paths are equally optimal in terms of MD reduction to A2 acceleration.\n\nLet's check for proximity to the enemy S1, Head at (9, 4). S1 is far away and operating on the right side, likely targeting A4 (8, 9).\n\n**S1 Prediction (Head at 9, 4)**\n\nS1 is at (9, 4).\nApples: A4 (8, 9) is 1 + 5 = 6 steps away.\n\nPossible moves for S1:\n1. UP to (9, 5): Clear. MD to A4 (8, 9): 1 + 4 = 5. Best move towards A4.\n2. DOWN to (9, 3): S1's neck. FATAL.\n3. LEFT to (8, 4): Clear. MD to A4 (8, 9): 0 + 5 = 5. Equivalent to UP, but potentially better for overall board control later.\n4. RIGHT to (10, 4): Border. FATAL.\n\nS1 will likely choose UP (9, 5) or LEFT (8, 4) to reach (8, 9). Neither of these moves affects my current position (4, 5) or my target moves (4, 6) or (3, 5).\n\n**Choosing between UP (4, 6) and LEFT (3, 5)**\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), the subsequent step is LEFT (3, 6), then LEFT (2, 6).\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 5), the subsequent step is UP (3, 6), then LEFT (2, 6).\n\nThe path via (3, 6) is central to capturing (2, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 5):\nNext turn (T55): (3, 5) -> (3, 6) [UP] (MD 1)\nNext turn (T56): (3, 6) -> (2, 6) [LEFT] (EAT)\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 6):\nNext turn (T55): (4, 6) -> (3, 6) [LEFT] (MD 1)\nNext turn (T56): (3, 6) -> (2, 6) [LEFT] (EAT)\n\nBoth options lead to (3, 6) in the next turn and a guaranteed apple grab in T56, provided no major obstacle appears.\n\nThe (4, 6) / (3, 6) path feels slightly more open and central in case I need to pivot towards A3 (2, 8). (4, 6) is closer to the y=6 line where the apple (2, 6) lies.\n\n(4, 6) is directly above my center mass (4, 5). (3, 5) is directly connected along the body line (5, 5). Moving UP to (4, 6) keeps my body slightly denser, which might be marginally better for control, but both are very solid moves.\n\nLet's go UP to align with the higher y-coordinate of the apple first.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT54: Move UP to (4, 6). MD to A2 (2, 6) is 2.\nT55: Head at (4, 6). Move LEFT to (3, 6). MD to A2 (2, 6) is 1.\nT56: Head at (3, 6). Move LEFT to (2, 6) and eat the apple. Length 17.\nT57: Head at (2, 6). Look for A3 (2, 8).\n\nUP",

If I move left to (3, 6) this turn, I will be 1 step away, and can eat it next turn.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from My Head (4, 6)**\n\nOccupied cells (ID 0 - Body): (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).

Collision. **FATAL.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 7), LEFT (3, 6).\n\n**Choosing the Move**\n\nThe goal is to reach A2 (2, 6) efficiently.\n\nMove LEFT to (3, 6):\nMD = 1. Guaranteed apple grab next turn (T56) by moving LEFT to (2, 6), assuming no enemy interaction.\n\nMove UP to (4, 7):\nMD = 3. This delays the grab.

Both moves keep S1 far away from my current target (2, 6).\n\n**Collision Check**\nSince I am moving to (3, 6) and S1 is moving to (9, 6) or (8, 5), there is no risk of a head-on collision or S1 intercepting my path to (2, 6).\n\nMy intended sequence:\nT55: Move LEFT to (3, 6).\nT56: Move LEFT to (2, 6) and eat A2.\n\nThis plan is safe and efficient.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT55: Move LEFT to (3, 6).

Eating this apple is the priority.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves from My Head (3, 6)**\n\nOccupied cells (ID 0 - Body): (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5).

Collision. **FATAL.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6).\n\n**Choosing the Move**\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 6) allows me to eat A2 immediately, increasing my score and length, and removing a nearby threat.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (Head at 9, 6)**\n\nS1 is at (9, 6). S1 is heading towards A4 (8, 9) (MD=4).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (Head 9, 6):\n1. UP to (9, 7): Clear. MD to A4 (8, 9): 1 + 2 = 3. **Best move.**\n2. DOWN to (9, 5): S1's neck. FATAL.\n3. LEFT to (8, 6): S1's body segment. Collision. FATAL. (Wait, let's recheck S1's body. Body starts at (9, 5). (8, 6) is clear. My mistake reading the board. (8, 6) is MY body. 'T' on the board is my body. '1' is S1's head. '0' is my head.)\n    * Board check: (8, 6) is T (ID 0 body segment). Collision. **FATAL for S1.**\n4. RIGHT to (10, 6): Border. FATAL.\n\nWait, the board state shows:\n(8, 6) is marked T (part of my snake).\nS1 Head is (9, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 6), it hits my body. S1 dies.\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 7), it is safe.\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 5), it hits its neck.\n\nS1's only safe move is UP to (9, 7). This confirms S1 will continue hunting A4 (8, 9) or pivot towards the other far apples. S1 remains far away from my target (2, 6).\n\n**Collision Check**\nI am moving LEFT to (2, 6). S1 is moving UP to (9, 7). No collision risk.\n\nThe move LEFT is safe and achieves the immediate goal of eating the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT56: Move LEFT to (2, 6) and eat A2. Length 17.\nT57: Head at (2, 6). Next closest accessible apple is A3 (2, 8) (MD=2).\nA5 (2, 0) is also close (MD=6).\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 7) (as predicted), it is still heading for A4 (8, 9). I should prioritize A3 (2, 8). Sequence: (2, 6) -> UP (2, 7) -> UP (2, 8) (eat A3). This takes 2 turns.\n\nStrategic choice for T57: Move UP to (2, 7).\n\nLEFT",

This is an eating move.\n    * This is the primary objective.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 6):**\n    * (2, 6) is my neck segment. Collision. **FATAL.**\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 7):**\n    * Safe from border, board, and other snakes.\n    * MD to A2 (2, 8): 1 + 1 = 2.

Moves away from closest apple.\n\nThe only move that directly leads to an immediate goal is UP. It is safe.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (Head at 9, 8)**\n\nS1 Head is (9, 8). S1 is chasing A3 (8, 9).\n\nDistance from S1 Head (9, 8) to apples:\nA1 (0, 0): 9 + 8 = 17\nA2 (2, 8): 7 + 0 = 7\nA3 (8, 9): 1 + 1 = 2 (Closest accessible, main target)\nA4 (2, 0): 7 + 8 = 15\nA5 (4, 1): 5 + 7 = 12\n\nS1 will likely move toward A3 (8, 9).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (Head 9, 8):\n1. UP to (9, 9): Clear. MD to A3: 0 + 1 = 1. **Best trajectory.**\n2. DOWN to (9, 7): S1's neck. FATAL.\n3. LEFT to (8, 8): (8, 8) is clear. MD to A3: 0 + 1 = 1. Good trajectory.\n4. RIGHT to (10, 8): Border. FATAL.\n\nS1 will choose either UP (9, 9) or LEFT (8, 8). Both lead directly to A3 (8, 9) next turn. If S1 chooses UP, it aims high. If S1 chooses LEFT, it aims horizontally. Historically, S1 has been prioritizing the shortest path, which usually means decreasing X or increasing Y to minimal difference. Both moves have MD 1 to A3 (8, 9) next turn, but (9, 9) means 0 distance in X, facilitating a quick LEFT move to eat.\n\nI move to (2, 8). S1 moves to (9, 9) or (8, 8). No collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMoving UP to (2, 8) secures apple A2, increases my lead, and is perfectly safe.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT58: Move UP to (2, 8) and eat A2. Length 18.\nT59: Head at (2, 8). Next targets are A4 (2, 0) (MD=8) and A1 (0, 0) (MD=10), or A5 (4, 1) (MD=5). A5 (4, 1) is closest, but moving toward A4 (2, 0) keeps me vertical and in control of the left side. I should aim for A5 (4, 1) first as it is the closest and provides a clear expansion path, then sweep Left/Down for A1 and A4. My immediate next move after eating A2 would be RIGHT towards (3, 8) or DOWN towards (2, 7) if the path allows (must check where my body is). Since S1 is likely cleaning up A3 (8, 9), I should focus on the remaining left and central apples.\n\nUP",

This is the only safe move for S1.\nIf S1 moves to (8, 9), its path opens up toward A6 (8, 0) [(8, 9) -> (8, 8) -> ... -> (8, 0)].\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment**\n\nMy proposed move: RIGHT to (3, 8).\nS1 likely move: LEFT to (8, 9).\n\n(3, 8) is far from (8, 9). No head-on collision risk. No body collision risk at (3, 8) since that cell is empty.\n\n**Optimal Path Selection**\n\nI choose RIGHT to (3, 8).

(4, 6) is my current body segment.\nIf I do not eat, (4, 6) will shift to (4, 5) at T59, then (5, 5) at T60, then (5, 6) at T61.\nMy goal is A5 (4, 1).\n\nLet's recalculate the body path movement for (4, 6) starting at T59:\nHead moves: (2, 8) -> (3, 8).\nBody shifts: (2, 7) -> (2, 8, new N), (2, 6) -> (2, 7), (3, 6) -> (2, 6), (4, 6) -> (3, 6).\nCurrent (4, 6) moves to (3, 6) *on this turn (T59)*.\n\nTherefore, (4, 6) is clear at T60.\n\nPreferred Path to A5 (4, 1):\nT59: (3, 8) [RIGHT]\nT60: (4, 8) [RIGHT]. (4, 7) clear. (4, 6) clear.\nT61: (4, 7) [DOWN].\nT62: (4, 6) [DOWN].\nT63: (4, 5) [DOWN].\nT64: (4, 4) [DOWN].\nT65: (4, 3) [DOWN].\nT66: (4, 2) [DOWN].\nT67: (4, 1) [DOWN] (Eat A5).\n\nThis path is viable and secures the central apple A5.\n\nAlternative: Chasing A4 (2, 0) and A1 (0, 0)\nT59: (1, 8) [LEFT]\nT60: (0, 8) [LEFT]\nT61: (0, 7) [DOWN]\n...\n(2, 0) is tricky because I am long and want to maximize efficiency. A long vertical run from (2, 8) down to (2, 0) is blocked by my neck/body segments.\n(2, 7) is my neck at T58.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 8), my body shifts.\nT59: Head (1, 8). Neck (2, 8). (2, 7) is now clear.\nT60: If I move DOWN to (1, 7).\nT61: Right to (2, 7).\nT62: Down to (2, 6). BLOCK. (2, 6) is current body segment, which shifts to (2, 7) at T59 and then (2, 8) at T60 (if I move (1, 7)). This path is too complex for A4 (2, 0) due to my length.\n\nThe RIGHT path towards A5 (4, 1) is strategically sound as it allows me to expand horizontally before committing to a vertical descent in a column largely clear of my body for the next few turns.\n\nMy lead is 17-12. Securing A5 further improves this lead.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT59: Move RIGHT to (3, 8). Focus on securing A5 (4, 1).\nT60-T67: Continue moving towards A5 (4, 1) along the (X=4) column, ensuring safe body movement prediction. S1 is likely chasing A6 (8, 0). After A5, evaluate A4 and A1.\n\nRIGHT",

Tail: (7, 3).\nApples collected: 17\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1):\nHead: (8, 9)\nBody: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]\nLength: 14 (S1 likely ate A3= (8, 9) or A6=(8,0) recently, maybe A3 in T59, increasing length). *Correction*: The previous board state (Turn 59 Rationale) showed S1 Head at (9, 9) and body [(9, 8)... (6, 0)] with 13 apples. If it moved LEFT to (8, 9) in T59, and an apple was placed there, or if I miscalculated the previous turn's eating: Let's assume the provided state is accurate. Head (8, 9), Body length 14, 13 apples. S1 must have just eaten an apple at (8, 9) or moved into a previous location of (8,9) and then the body shifted. If S1 was at (9, 9) on T59, and moved LEFT to (8, 9), and if an apple was at (8, 9), S1 ate it. This usually happens when an apple spawns *exactly* where a head moves. It looks like S1 ate A (8, 9) on T59, hence the length 14 and 13 apples (since *my* rationale for T59 stated 12 apples for S1).\n\nApples at: A1 (0, 0), A2 (2, 0), A3 (4, 1), A4 (8, 0), A5 (5, 9). (Labels reassigned for clarity based on position reading top-to-bottom, left-to-right, but using the board list order for consistency)\nA(0, 0), A(2, 0), A(4, 1), A(8, 0), A(5, 9).\n\nTarget apples are:\nA(4, 1): MD |3-4| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\nA(5, 9): MD |3-5| + |8-9| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Closest!)\nA(8, 0): MD |3-8| + |8-0| = 5 + 8 = 13\nA(2, 0): MD |3-2| + |8-0| = 1 + 8 = 9\nA(0, 0): MD |3-0| + |8-0| = 3 + 8 = 11\n\nThe immediate closest apple is A(5, 9).\n\nBoard visualization (H: my head, 0: my body, 1: S1 head, T: S1 body, A: Apple):\n 9 . . . . .

(3, 9) is clear.\n    * Path to A(5, 9): This moves me towards the apple A(5, 9) efficiently.\n    * MD to A(5, 9): |3-5| + |9-9| = 2. Very close!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    * Safe. (3, 7) is clear.\n    * MD to A(5, 9): 2 + 2 = 4. Less efficient than UP.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    * (2, 8) is my neck segment (body[0]). Collision. **FATAL.**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n    * Safe. (4, 8) is clear.\n    * Path to A(5, 9): (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9) [Eat]. This is a 3-step path.\n    * MD to A(5, 9): |4-5| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2. Also very close.\n\n**Comparing UP and RIGHT for A(5, 9)**\n\nA(5, 9) is the immediate priority.\n\nOption UP:\nT60: (3, 9). MD 2.\nT61: (4, 9). MD 1.\nT62: (5, 9). EAT. (3 steps)\n\nOption RIGHT:\nT60: (4, 8). MD 2.\nT61: (5, 8). MD 1.\nT62: (5, 9). EAT. (3 steps)\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to eating A(5, 9) in 3 turns.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (Head at 8, 9)**\n\nS1 Head is (8, 9). S1 must have just entered this cell.\nS1 is likely interested in A(8, 0) (MD 9+0=9) or perhaps moving away from the corner.\nS1 possible safe moves:\n1. UP to (8, 10): Border. FATAL.\n2. DOWN to (8, 8): Clear. MD to A(8, 0): 0 + 8 = 8.\n3. LEFT to (7, 9): Clear. MD to A(8, 0): 1 + 9 = 10.\n4. RIGHT to (9, 9): (9, 9) is S1's neck. FATAL.\n\nS1 must move DOWN to (8, 8) to pursue A(8, 0), which is the closest apple for S1 by a large margin (MD 8).\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment**\n\nMy proposed moves UP (3, 9) or RIGHT (4, 8).\nS1 likely move DOWN (8, 8).\n\nThere is no immediate head-on collision risk, as (3, 9)/(4, 8) are far from (8, 8).\nNeither (3, 9) nor (4, 8) are occupied by S1's body.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move (UP vs RIGHT)**\n\nBoth take 3 turns to reach A(5, 9).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 9): I am expanding into the top edge, moving me away from the block of my own body segments in rows 6, 7. This keeps my path open for the next apple, A(4, 1), which is further down the board, requiring future maneuvering towards the center/bottom.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 8): I am moving towards the center of the board, slightly closer to the path I planned previously towards A(4, 1).\n\nLet's look at the body shift consequence. My body is long (18). The tail (7, 3) will vacate.\n\nIf I choose UP:\nT60 H=(3, 9). Next steps (4, 9), (5, 9).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT:\nT60 H=(4, 8). Next steps (5, 8), (5, 9).\n\nBoth seem great. Moving RIGHT (4, 8) is slightly better for overall board coverage and positioning for subsequent apples like A(4, 1) by staying closer to the central column structure.\n\nLet's stick with the RIGHT move, as it maintains connectivity to the rest of the board structure more centrally compared to being stuck along the y=9 boundary for a turn or two.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nMy current objective is A(5, 9).\nT60: RIGHT to (4, 8).\nT61: UP to (4, 9). *Wait, (4, 9) is clear.* No, (4, 9) is clear. The fastest path to (5, 9) from (4, 8) is RIGHT to (5, 8), then UP to (5, 9).\nT61: RIGHT to (5, 8).\nT62: UP to (5, 9) (EAT A5). Success guaranteed barring unforeseen S1 movement that blocks (5, 8) or (5, 9), which is unlikely if S1 goes DOWN to (8, 8). (8, 8) is far.\n\nRevised Path for RIGHT:\nT60: (4, 8) [RIGHT]\nT61: (5, 8) [RIGHT]\nT62: (5, 9) [UP] (Eat A5, 18 apples)\n\nLet's re-verify the UP path:\nT60: (3, 9) [UP]\nT61: (4, 9) [RIGHT]\nT62: (5, 9) [RIGHT] (Eat A5, 18 apples)\nThis path is also 3 steps.\n\nSince the goal is the same short-term outcome, and RIGHT keeps me slightly more flexible to drop down quickly towards A(4, 1) afterward, I will proceed with RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

(4, 9) is clear.\n    * Path to A(5, 9) (2 steps): (4, 9) -> (5, 9) [EAT]. This is 2 moves away.\n    * MD to A(5, 9): |4-5| + |9-9| = 1. Excellent.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n    * Safe. (4, 7) is clear.\n    * Path to A(5, 9): Inefficient direction. MD 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    * (3, 8) is my neck. **FATAL.**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    * Safe.

Excellent.\n\nBoth UP (4, 9) and RIGHT (5, 8) are optimal for reaching A(5, 9) in 2 turns.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction (Head at 7, 9)**\n\nS1 Head is (7, 9). S1 is constrained by the top wall and its own body segments (8, 9) and (9, 9).\nS1 likely wants A(8, 0). MD to A(8, 0): 1 + 9 = 10.\nS1 safe moves:\n1. UP to (7, 10): Border. FATAL.\n2. DOWN to (7, 8): Clear. MD to A(8, 0): 1 + 8 = 9. This is the shortest path towards A(8, 0).\n3. LEFT to (6, 9): Clear. MD to A(8, 0): 2 + 9 = 11.\n4. RIGHT to (8, 9): (8, 9) is S1's neck. FATAL.\n\nS1 is highly likely to move DOWN to (7, 8).\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment**\n\nMy optimal moves are (4, 9) or (5, 8).\nS1 likely moves to (7, 8).\nThere is no risk of collision this turn.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move (UP vs RIGHT)**\n\nIf I choose UP (4, 9):\nT61: (4, 9).\nT62: RIGHT to (5, 9) [EAT].\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (5, 8):\nT61: (5, 8).\nT62: UP to (5, 9) [EAT].\n\nBoth moves lead to eating A(5, 9) on T62, securing another apple (total 18).\n\nWe need to consider the positioning for the *next* apple. The remaining nearby apple is A(4, 1).\nA(4, 1) MD: From (4, 9) is 0 + 8 = 8.\nA(4, 1) MD: From (5, 8) is 1 + 7 = 8.\nAfter eating at (5, 9), my head will be there.\nA(4, 1) MD: From (5, 9) is 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nIf I choose UP (4, 9) this turn:\nAfter eating at (5, 9), I'd be at (5, 9). To get to (4, 1), I'd want to move LEFT/DOWN initially.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (5, 8) this turn:\nAfter eating at (5, 9), I'd be at (5, 9). Same subsequent positioning.\n\nSince (5, 8) is slightly more central/south compared to (4, 9), and getting to A(4, 1) requires a southern trajectory, moving RIGHT to (5, 8) slightly better prepares me for the subsequent DOWN moves required after securing A(5, 9). The difference is marginal, but RIGHT maintains the previous decision's intent of staying off the far upper wall.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT61: Move RIGHT to (5, 8).\nT62: Move UP to (5, 9) (Eat A5).\nT63 onwards: Evaluate path to A(4, 1), A(8, 0), or A(2, 0) depending on remaining apples and S1 position. A(4, 1) appears most favorable next (MD 9 from 5, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

UP (6, 10): Border. FATAL.\n2. DOWN (6, 8): Clear. Risk of collision with me if I move RIGHT.\n3. LEFT (5, 9): Apple A5. Risk of collision with me if I move UP.\n4. RIGHT (7, 9): (7, 9) is S1's neck. FATAL.\n\nS1 must choose between DOWN (6, 8) and LEFT (5, 9).\n\n*   **S1 moving LEFT to (5, 9) [Apple]:** S1 gets the apple. Current MD from S1 to the next closest apple A(4, 1) is 1+8=9, to A(8, 0) is 3+9=12.\n*   **S1 moving DOWN to (6, 8):** S1 avoids collision/commits to future direction. MD from S1 to A(4, 1) is 2+7=9, to A(8, 0) is 2+8=10.\n\nGiven S1's positioning, (5, 9) is an immediate guaranteed apple for S1. Since S1 is closer (1 move vs my 1 move), S1 should be highly motivated to contest this tile.\n\n**Risk Assessment for My Move UP (5, 9):**\nIf I move UP, and S1 moves LEFT, we 100% head-on collide. S1 knows I'm right next to the apple (I was at 5, 8). S1 is also 1 move away. S1 has no clear path benefit from avoiding the apple, as moving DOWN (6, 8) instead sets up a collision if I move RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP, I risk death (50% probability based on S1's two safe/rational choices). Since S1 is competitive (13 apples), it is reasonable to assume it will prioritize eating apples, especially an uncontested one or one where it poses a significant threat.\n\n**Risk Assessment for My Move RIGHT (6, 8):**\nIf I move RIGHT, and S1 moves DOWN, we 100% head-on collide.\n\n**What did S1 do last turn?**\nS1 moved LEFT from (7, 9) to (6, 9). This move was strictly aimed at A(5, 9). S1 has invested two moves to get into this position. This confirms S1 prioritizing A(5, 9).\n\n*   My current move is UP to (5, 9).\n*   S1's continuation of its strategy is LEFT to (5, 9).\n\nGiven S1's path, it is extremely likely S1 is targeting (5, 9) this turn. Therefore, moving UP is suicidal.\n\n**Conclusion: I must abort the target apple A(5, 9).**\n\n**What if I move to a non-colliding location?**\n\nThe only non-self-killing move that doesn't put me directly into one of S1's two threatening spots is:\n*   **UP (5, 9):** Collision if S1 moves LEFT.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 8):** Collision if S1 moves DOWN.\n\nThis is a defensive situation. I have no guaranteed safe non-backwards move. Wait, my body occupied cells check:\n(5, 7) is MY body. (4, 8) is MY neck.\n\nRethinking the occupied cells check:\nMy body (from the list, excluding head): [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)]\n(5, 7) IS in my body. I cannot move DOWN.\n\nMy safe moves are only: UP (5, 9) or RIGHT (6, 8). Both lead to a high probability of a fatal head-on collision based on S1's expected optimal play.\n\nIs there any reason S1 would choose a defensive move?\nIf S1 sees I am also 1 move away, it might prioritize survival or try to trap me. However, if S1 moves LEFT (5, 9), it gets the apple and forces a draw (if I also go UP). If S1 moves DOWN (6, 8), it guarantees survival if I go UP, but I can then eat A(5, 9) next turn (if S1 did not block me from reaching it). If S1 moves DOWN, and I move RIGHT, both die.\n\nS1 prefers to move LEFT (5, 9) to ensure it gets the apple, even at the risk of mutual death, since it has fewer apples than me (13 vs 17) and mutual death is a tie-breaking win for me, but S1 might miscalculate or be focused solely on the reward.\n\nSince I have the lead (17 vs 13), my priority is survival. I must move in a way that minimizes collision risk, even if it delays eating the apple.\n\nLet's assume S1 is playing aggressively for the apple (LEFT to 5, 9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 8), S1 survives, I survive. S1 gets the apple.\nIf S1 is playing defensively (DOWN to 6, 8).\nIf I move UP to (5, 9), S1 survives, I eat the apple.\n\nIf I prioritize survival (move where I am least likely to meet S1), where should I go? The probability of S1 choosing LEFT (5, 9) seems slightly higher than DOWN (6, 8), as LEFT yields an apple immediately.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT (5, 9):\n1. My UP (5, 9) -> Death.\n2. My RIGHT (6, 8) -> Safety. I lose the apple, but survive.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN (6, 8):\n1. My UP (5, 9) -> Safety. I eat the apple!\n2. My RIGHT (6, 8) -> Death.\n\nSince I cannot know S1's move, I must pick the move that keeps me alive against the most aggressive expected move by S1 (moving for the apple).\n\n**Expected S1 move: LEFT (5, 9)** (Apple greed)\nMy safe counter is RIGHT (6, 8).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (6, 8):\nS1 moves LEFT to (5, 9) and gets the apple (Score 17 | 14). I survive.\nS1 moves DOWN to (6, 8) -> Collision. Death.\n\nThis is a terrible trap. I have only two moves, and both lead to collision if S1 plays optimally *against* my move.\n\nLet's analyze S1's perspective:\nS1 is at (6, 9). Target (5, 9) or (6, 8).\nIf S1 moves to (5, 9): I might move (5, 9) (Death) or (6, 8) (Survival).\nIf S1 moves to (6, 8): I might move (5, 9) (Survival) or (6, 8) (Death).\n\nIf S1 wants ME dead: S1 should randomize, or perhaps move to (6, 8) hoping I go RIGHT, as I am already trending RIGHT. However, S1 knows I was targeting (5, 9) previously.\n\nIf S1 wants the APPLE: S1 must move to (5, 9).\n\nIf I assume S1 is rational and knows I want the apple, S1 would move to (5, 9) to either secure the apple or force a mutual death (which might be seen as advantageous if they think they are falling too far behind, though I have the tie-breaker).\n\nGiven the high probability S1 contests (5, 9), moving UP is too risky.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT to (6, 8)?\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (6, 8), we collide. S1 has no apple advantage for moving DOWN. It is just securing a position. If S1 is rational, S1 should move to (5, 9).\n\nSo, if S1 moves (5, 9) (LEFT):\nI move (6, 8) (RIGHT). I survive, S1 gets the apple. New Head: (6, 8). S1 Head: (5, 9).\n\nThis is the only move that guarantees survival against S1's highest percentage move (going for the apple).\n\nAfter moving to (6, 8), I am still well-positioned to go for A(8, 0) or loop around for A(4, 1) or A(2, 0).\n\n**Detailed calculation of remaining options after T62 (assuming S1 moves LEFT to 5, 9 and I move RIGHT to 6, 8):**\nMy Head: (6, 8). S1 Head: (5, 9).\nRemaining Apples: (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 1), (8, 0).\n\nMD from (6, 8) to:\nA(8, 0): 2 + 8 = 10\nA(4, 1): 2 + 7 = 9\nA(2, 0): 4 + 8 = 12\n\nMD from S1 (5, 9) to:\nA(8, 0): 3 + 9 = 12\nA(4, 1): 1 + 8 = 9\nA(2, 0): 3 + 9 = 12\n\nWe are tied for proximity to A(4, 1). A(4, 1) is now the primary next target.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the defensive choice that maximizes survival against the expected aggressive behavior of the opponent.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nT62: Move RIGHT to (6, 8) to avoid collision while opponent Snake #1 is likely targeting A(5, 9).\nT63 onwards: Since Snake #1 will be at (5, 9), A(4, 1) becomes the next likely contested apple. I must plan a path from (6, 8) to A(4, 1) while being aware of S1's potential route south/west. My position (6, 8) allows for movement towards the eastern side (A(8, 0) is also an option, but A(4, 1) is closer).\n\nRIGHT",
