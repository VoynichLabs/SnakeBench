They are many moves away from (6,7), so that apple is effectively ours.\n- Racing straight down column 8 toward (8,3) would likely synchronize our arrival with the enemy coming up from (8,0), risking a head-on collision on that apple and potentially turning the game into a draw. With a current lead, we should avoid that symmetric race.\n\nMove comparison:\n- RIGHT: pushes us toward the top-right corner and closer to the enemy’s future route down the right side; fewer escape options.\n- DOWN: keeps options open and points us toward the contested bottom-right apples, but delays securing the free apple at (6,7) and increases chances of direct contention at (8,3).\n- LEFT: moves us into the safer central area and sets up a quick, essentially uncontested grab of (6,7) next turn. Temporary reduction to 2–1 safe continuations during the apple grab is acceptable because the post-apple position at (6,6) opens back into the central board with multiple exits.\n\nStrategy note to future self:\n- Take (6,7) soon (likely via LEFT again next turn) to go up 1 apple over the opponent after they take (8,0).\n- After that, move down/central (around columns 5–7) rather than hugging the right wall, to avoid head-on races for (8,3) that could result in a draw.\n- Keep wide, looping paths that preserve multiple exits; avoid sealing yourself against the top or right borders when the enemy is climbing the right side.\n\nLEFT",

However, if you later go for (5,4) from here, your body will occupy (6,4), slightly reducing central flexibility and making a direct route to (6,3) trickier (you’d need to go via (5,3)).\n- LEFT → (5,5): safe this turn, and sets you up for a clean, fast grab of the apple at (5,4) next turn with excellent follow-up options (to (6,4), (5,3), or leftwards). You also beat the enemy to that apple by a wide margin, with zero risk of head-on collision there.\n\nGoing LEFT now, then DOWN to (5,4), gives you:\n- A quick, safe apple that the enemy cannot contest in time.\n- A more open central shape afterward (since (6,4) will remain empty), leaving you flexible to approach (6,3) later via (6,4) or swing toward the left-side apples.\n\nThe enemy at (8,3) cannot reach (5,5) or (5,4) in time to cause a head-on collision in the next couple of turns, regardless of how they move.\n\n**Strategy note to future self (next few turns):**\n- Next move, strongly favor DOWN from (5,5) to take (5,4) unless a surprising threat appears.\n- After eating (5,4), reassess paths to (6,3) versus swinging left toward (2,3)/(1,6). Avoid direct races for (6,3) that could produce a simultaneous head-on with the enemy.\n- Maintain space away from the enemy’s growing body in the bottom-right; use your upper-central coil as a safe “wall” behind you and expand into the left/center.\n\nLEFT",
