The enemy snake is at (7,8), so:\n- **UP**: (0,9) \u2192 Off the board (y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top). **Dead move**.\n- **DOWN**: (2,9) \u2192 Safe (no collision).\n- **LEFT**: (1,8) \u2192 Safe (no collision).\n- **RIGHT**: (1,10) \u2192 Off the board (x=10 is invalid). **Dead move**.\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are immediately fatal. Only **DOWN** and **LEFT** are safe.\n\n### **Next Steps: Safe Moves**\n#### **Option 1: DOWN to (2,9)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - No immediate collision.\n  - Moves toward the bottom-left corner, which is near apples at (1,4) and (1,0).\n  - Enemy snake is at (7,8), so no direct threat yet.\n- **Cons**:\n  - If the enemy moves toward you, you could be caught. But since the enemy is alone and far away, this is unlikely.\n  - No immediate growth opportunity (no apple adjacent to (2,9)).\n\n#### **Option 2: LEFT to (1,8)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves toward the left edge, near apples at (1,4) and (1,0).\n  - If you grow, you could block the enemy or create a path to apples.\n- **Cons**:\n  - No immediate apple adjacency, but future growth is possible if you reach (1,4) or (1,0).\n  - Enemy is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy**\n- **Prioritize growth**: Since you have no body, any move that allows you to grow (e.g., toward an apple) is better.\n- **Avoid enemy threats**: The enemy is alone and far away, so no immediate danger.\n- **Expand horizontally**: Moving left toward (1,4) or (1,0) is more strategic because:\n  - You can grow toward the left edge, which is near apples.\n  - If you move right, you\u2019d be moving away from the apples you could reach by moving left.\n\n### **Rationale for Next Move**\nMoving **LEFT** to (1,8) is the best choice because:\n1. It keeps you safe.\n2. It opens up a path to apples at (1,4) and (1,0) in future turns.\n3. It avoids moving away from potential growth opportunities.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nLEFT",

UP: (7, 9) - Would go off the board (y=9 is top edge) \u2192 Invalid\n2. DOWN: (7, 7) - Valid\n3. LEFT: (6, 8) - Valid\n4. RIGHT: (8, 8) - Valid\n\n**Analysis:**\n- UP is invalid (would kill me)\n- DOWN (7,7): Safe, moves away from enemy, but doesn't get closer to any apples\n- LEFT (6,8): Safe, moves toward the apple at (6,5) and (6,2)\n- RIGHT (8,8): Safe, but moves away from all apples\n\n**Best Option:**\nLEFT is the best move because:\n1. It's safe (no collision with anything)\n2. It moves toward two apples (6,5) and (6,2)\n3. It keeps future options open (can still go down toward (6,2) or up toward (6,5))\n4. It moves away from the enemy snake\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nFor the next few turns, I should prioritize moving toward the cluster of apples on the left side (x=1,4,6) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. The apples at (6,5) and (6,2) are particularly good targets since they're in a vertical line, making them easier to collect sequentially.\n\nLEFT",
