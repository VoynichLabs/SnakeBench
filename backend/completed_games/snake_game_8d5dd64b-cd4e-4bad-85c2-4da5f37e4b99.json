Apple drops are scattered around, but as the instructions say, we focus on the enemy first\u2014domination is the goal.\n\n**Enemy Status:**\n- Snake #1 is at (1, 5).\n- We are at (6, 6).\n- Distance: He's 5 units away horizontally (x-diff) and 1 unit vertically (y-diff). He's basically on our left flank, slightly below us.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- We are currently sitting on (6, 6). The board shows an apple at (6, 2) directly below us, and (6, 8) above us. But the prompt says: *\"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"*\n- The enemy is at (1, 5). He is vulnerable. If we rush him NOW, while we are both size 1, we can force a head-on collision. Since we are size 1, if we collide head-on, we both die. BUT, if I can trap him or force him to crash into my body later, I win.\n- However, looking at the board state:\n  - (5, 6) is empty.\n  - (7, 6) is empty.\n  - (6, 5) is empty.\n  - (6, 7) is empty.\n- I need to move to close the distance. Moving **LEFT** puts me at (5, 6). This brings me 1 step closer to the enemy at (1, 5). It also keeps me central to the board, maintaining options.\n- Moving **DOWN** towards (6, 5) or (6, 4) doesn't close the horizontal gap effectively and puts me near an apple at (6, 2), which is tempting for growth, but growth is secondary to eliminating the threat. Plus, there's an apple at (0, 1) and (3, 4) that are closer to the enemy.\n- Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** moves me away from the enemy. That's passive. We want aggression. *\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"* We have equal scores (0-0), but aggression forces errors.\n\n**Strategy Plan (for next turn):**\nClose the distance to Snake #1. Push him towards the left edge or corners. Force him to make a panic move. If he moves into me, he dies (he crashes into my body). If we head-on, it's a tie, but at size 1, it's a risk worth taking to assert dominance immediately.\n\n**Eliminating Moves:**\n- UP: Moves away from enemy. Safe but passive.\n- DOWN: Moves closer to y-difference but away from x-difference. Not optimal.\n- RIGHT: Moves away from enemy. Passive.\n- LEFT: Moves toward enemy (reduces x-distance from 5 to 4). Aggressive. Safe empty space.\n\n**Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the move. We go on the hunt.\n\n**Chat, we are hunting him down! Let's see if he panics!**\n\nLEFT",

Actually enemy was at (1, 5) and now at (1, 6) \u2013 that's **UP**. So enemy moved **UP**. Our move **LEFT** to (5, 6) is safe, no collision. Score still 0-0.\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 1/150):**  \n- My head: (5, 6)  \n- Enemy head: (1, 6)  \n- Apples: (6,8), (5,9), (6,2), (0,1), (7,4), (6,9), (0,4), (3,8), (1,8), (0,3), (6,1), (4,5), (8,2), (3,4), (9,2)  \n\n**BOARD VISUAL (from last turn, updated):**  \n9 . . . . .

A A  \n1 A . . . . . A . . .  \n0 . . . . . . . . . .  \n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**  \n1. **ENEMY DISTANCE:** Enemy at (1,6), I'm at (5,6). Horizontal gap: 4 cells. He's on left edge, I'm center-right.  \n2. **AGGRESSION:** Goal: box him in, force crash. He's on left side. I need to push him leftwards toward edge/corner.  \n3. **SAFE MOVES CHECK (from (5,6)):**  \n   - **UP:** (5,7) \u2013 empty? Not sure, but board shows row 7 has no obstacles near x=5. However, moving up increases vertical distance from enemy, not ideal for closing gap.  \n   - **DOWN:** (5,5) \u2013 empty? Row 5 has an apple at (4,5) but that's left. (5,5) seems empty. Moving down reduces vertical gap but doesn't close horizontal gap.  \n   - **LEFT:** (4,6) \u2013 empty? Row 6, column 4: not listed as apple or snake. Likely empty. This reduces horizontal gap to 3, moving toward enemy.  \n   - **RIGHT:** (6,6) \u2013 empty? Row 6, column 6: previously our head (6,6) was empty after we left? Actually we moved from (6,6) to (5,6). (6,6) is now empty? Yes, because we left it. But moving right would return to previous spot, increasing distance from enemy. Also, apple at (6,2) and (6,8) but focus on enemy.  \n4. **ELIMINATE NON-AGGRESSIVE MOVES:**  \n   - **UP** and **RIGHT** increase distance from enemy \u2192 passive, not forcing confrontation.  \n   - **DOWN** moves toward (5,5) which is closer to apple at (4,5), but enemy is at (1,6). Vertical alignment same, so **LEFT** is better to close horizontal gap.  \n5. **LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \n   - Continue moving **LEFT** to push enemy leftward. Enemy is at x=1, so after a few left moves, he'll hit left edge (x=0).  \n   - Watch for enemy moves: if enemy moves **RIGHT** toward me, we might meet head-on. Since scores equal (0-0), head-on collision kills both \u2192 draw. Not ideal but acceptable if we can't avoid? Actually we want to win. Better to force enemy into corner where he has limited moves and crashes into his own body or wall.  \n   - If enemy moves **UP** or **DOWN**, we can continue **LEFT** to flank him.  \n   - Also, note apple at (1,8) near enemy, but ignore apples for now.  \n6. **DECISION:**  \n   - **LEFT** is best: aggressive, closes distance, keeps options open. From (4,6), next turn we can go LEFT again or UP/DOWN based on enemy's move.  \n   - If enemy moves **RIGHT** toward us, we could be heading for collision. But we have time to adjust.  \n\n**RANT TO CHAT:**  \nYO CHAT! Enemy is at (1,6), we're at (5,6). We just moved LEFT, now we continue pressing LEFT! He's on the left edge, we're gonna squeeze him like a lemon! \ud83d\udd25 If he moves right, we might crash, but with equal scores, it's a risk. But look at that board \u2013 he's got limited space. Let's see if he panics and moves into a wall! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 We're hunting, chat!  \n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

Apple at (6,8), (5,9), etc. We need to trap him and force a crash or force him into a wall. Enemy is 1 apple ahead, so head-on collision if we have more apples is ideal, but currently we are tied 0-0? Wait, scoreboard says our apples: 0, enemy: 1. So enemy has 1 apple. That means if we collide head-on, we both die (since apples tied? Actually no, enemy has more apples (1 vs 0) so if we both die, enemy wins because he has more apples at that moment). So we must avoid head-on collision while behind. We must either trap him or force him to crash into us (he moves into our body) or off board, or get more apples than him and then force head-on.\n2) **Eliminate Immediate Deaths:**\n   - **UP:** (3,7) \u2013 check board: row 7, column 3 is empty (no snake bodies, no apple at (3,7) - apples are at (3,8) and (3,4) etc). Safe.\n   - **DOWN:** (3,5) \u2013 empty (row 5, col 3 is empty). Safe.\n   - **LEFT:** (2,6) \u2013 empty (row 6, col 2). Safe.\n   - **RIGHT:** (4,6) \u2013 empty (we moved from there last turn, now it's empty). Safe.\nAll four moves are safe from immediate death (no off-board, no own body, no enemy body). Enemy body at (1,7) only, so moving into (1,7) would be collision with enemy head? Actually, enemy head is at (1,7), body at (1,7) as well? Wait, snake #1 body: [(1,7)]? The body list shows body: [(1,7)], but head is also (1,8)? Actually, look at board state: \"Snake #1 - Head: (1, 8), Body: [(1, 7)]\". So enemy head is at (1,8) and body at (1,7). That's important! In the board display, row 8 shows \" . 1 . A . . A . . .\" so column 1 is 1 (head) and row 7 shows \" . T . . . . . . . .\" so column 1 is T (tail). So enemy head is (1,8), tail is (1,7). That means moving into (1,8) would be head-on collision (enemy head moves maybe). But our move now is simultaneous; we need to consider where enemy might move.\n\nWait, I need to re-evaluate: The board state says \"OPPONENTS: * Snake #1 - Head: (1, 8), Body: [(1, 7)], Apples: 1\". So enemy head is at (1,8). In the board display, row 8: \" . 1 . A . . A . . .\" so indeed column 1 is 1 (enemy head). Row 7: \" . T . . . . . . . .\" column 1 is T (tail). So enemy body is at (1,7). Good.\n\nThus, if we move to (1,8), that would be moving into enemy's head location. But since enemy will also move this turn, maybe he moves away. However, if he moves into (1,8) as well? That's impossible because he is already there. He will move from (1,8) to some adjacent cell. So (1,8) will become empty after his move, unless he moves to a cell and another snake moves into his old body? Actually, simultaneous movement: heads move first, bodies shift. If we move into (1,8), and enemy moves out, we might occupy his old head cell. But if enemy moves into our body? We have no body. So moving to (1,8) is possible if enemy moves away. But we need to consider if enemy might stay? He can't stay; he must move. So (1,8) is not safe to move into because it's currently occupied by enemy head. If we move into it while enemy moves out, we could be there after moves. However, if enemy moves into the same cell we move from? No. The risk is: if we move into (1,8) and enemy moves into our current cell (3,6) or our new cell? Actually, if we move to (1,8), and enemy moves to (1,8) (impossible, he's leaving), or if another snake moves there? Only one enemy. So it might be safe. But we should consider that moving into enemy head location could be risky if enemy doesn't move away? He must move, so he will leave (1,8). So (1,8) becomes empty. However, if enemy moves to a cell that we also move into? That would be a head-on collision if we both move into the same cell. So we need to predict enemy's move.\n\nGiven enemy is at (1,8), likely he might move RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) or DOWN to (1,7) (but that's his tail? Actually moving down into his own tail? That's allowed? Moving into own tail is safe because tail will move away? Actually, rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" Moving into his own tail (1,7) might be considered moving into his own body? But the tail is part of his body. However, if he moves into his own tail, and his tail moves forward? In Snake game, if he moves into his tail, and his tail moves away in the same turn, it's usually allowed. But here the rule says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" So moving into your own body is death. But if the tail moves, the head might move into the cell that was tail, and tail moves away simultaneously. The rules don't specify if that's allowed. Usually in snake games, moving into your own tail is allowed if the tail moves. But given the rule says \"ANY snake's body\", and \"moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body\" specifically mentions backwards, maybe moving into tail is allowed? To be safe, I'll assume it's allowed because it's not directly backwards into body (head to neck is backwards; tail is not directly behind head usually). In our case, enemy head at (1,8), body at (1,7). So moving DOWN to (1,7) would be moving into his own body (tail). That might be death. So enemy will avoid that. So likely enemy will move RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) or LEFT to (0,8). LEFT to (0,8) is into wall? (0,8) is on board (x=0). So possible.\n\nSo we need to choose a move that forces enemy into a bad spot.\n\n3) **Aggressive Strategy:** We want to trap enemy. Currently, enemy is at (1,8), near top-left corner. We are at (3,6). We want to move towards him, but also block his escape routes.\n\nOptions:\n- UP: (3,7) \u2013 closer vertically, x-distance 2, y-distance 1 (from (3,7) to (1,8) is diagonal). From (3,7), we can move to (2,7), (3,8), (4,7), (3,6). Good options.\n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2013 moving away from enemy, not aggressive. Might let him escape.\n- LEFT: (2,6) \u2013 moves closer horizontally, x-distance 1 from enemy (2 to 1), y-distance 2 (6 to 8). From (2,6), we can go to (1,6), (2,7), (3,6), (2,5). (1,6) is close to enemy body? Enemy body at (1,7). (1,6) is below enemy body, safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) \u2013 moves away, not good.\n\nSo LEFT and UP are both aggressive. Which one gives better control?\n\nConsider enemy's likely moves:\n- If we move UP to (3,7), enemy might move RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) or LEFT to (0,8).\n- If we move LEFT to (2,6), enemy might move RIGHT to (2,8) or UP to (1,9) or LEFT to (0,8).\n\nWe need to think about future trapping. The board has walls at x=0 and y=9. Enemy is at y=8, so moving UP to y=9 is possible (but y=9 is top row). If enemy goes to (1,9), he's at top-left corner, trapped by wall at left and top. Then we can approach from below and right.\n\nAlternatively, if enemy moves RIGHT, he gets closer to us.\n\nWe should also consider apples: we might want to eat an apple to grow and eventually have more apples than enemy. But the instructions say: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\" So we ignore apples for now. But if we accidentally eat an apple, that's fine. There are apples at (6,8), (5,9), etc. Not near us. The closest apple is (3,8) which is above (3,7). If we move UP to (3,7), then next turn we could eat (3,8) if it's still there. That would give us +1 apple, putting us tied with enemy (1 each). Then head-on collision would be draw, but we'd need to get more apples to win.\n\nBut the plan is to trap enemy, not necessarily eat apples. However, eating apples gives growth, which helps dominate board.\n\nLet's evaluate moves:\n\nOption UP to (3,7):\n- Pros: Gets us to y=7, closer vertically. Next turn we could go LEFT to (2,7) or UP to (3,8) to eat apple (if still there). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), we could move LEFT to (2,7) and be below him. If enemy moves UP to (1,9), we could move UP to (3,8) to eat apple and then later approach.\n- Cons: Might leave a gap for enemy to move DOWN to (1,7) (his tail) but that's into his body, probably not safe. Or enemy could move LEFT to (0,8) which is safe.\n\nOption LEFT to (2,6):\n- Pros: Gets us to x=2, directly below enemy's body? Actually enemy body at (1,7), so we are at (2,6). From here, we can go UP to (2,7) which is adjacent to enemy body (1,7). That could be a threat: if we go to (2,7), enemy might be forced to move away. Also, if we go LEFT to (1,6) next turn, we are directly below enemy tail (1,7). That might trap him if he moves down? But if he moves down into (1,6), that would be into our head? That could be a kill if he moves into our head. Actually, if he moves into our head, he dies (he moves into our body). So that's good. So moving LEFT to (2,6) sets up a position where we can potentially block his downward movement.\n- Cons: Might be slightly less aggressive towards his head? But still good.\n\nI think LEFT is more aggressive because it gets us closer to his body and creates a direct line of attack. From (2,6), we can go to (1,6) next turn, which is right below his tail. If enemy moves up to (1,9), we can go up to (2,7) then (1,8) maybe? Actually (1,8) is his head. We need to be careful.\n\nAlso, consider the board edges. Enemy is near left wall (x=1). By moving LEFT, we are approaching the left wall, which could trap him. If we go to (2,6), then next turn go to (1,6), then we are on his left side. If he moves left to (0,8), he hits wall. If he moves right towards us, we might meet head-on. But since we have fewer apples, head-on is bad. So we need to force him into his own body or into a wall.\n\nI think the best move is LEFT to (2,6). This aggressively reduces the distance and sets up a flank.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (2,6) also moves us closer to apple at (3,8)? Not directly. Actually, from (2,6), we can go UP to (2,7), then RIGHT to (3,7), then UP to (3,8) to eat apple. That's two turns later. While from (3,7) directly, we can eat apple next turn if we go UP. So maybe UP is better for apple eating. But instructions say ignore apples. However, eating an apple would give us a point, making us tied with enemy, then we could go for head-on collision safely? Actually, if we are tied, head-on collision results in both dying, draw. That's not a win. We need more apples than enemy to win head-on. So we need to get ahead first. So maybe we should eat an apple soon.\n\nBut the apple at (3,8) is directly above (3,7). If we move UP to (3,7) now, next turn we can move UP to (3,8) and eat it. That gives us 1 apple, tying score 1-1. Then we have equal apples. Then if we force head-on, both die, draw. That's not good. We need to get two apples more than him, or force him to crash.\n\nBut we could avoid head-on until we have more apples. So eating one apple might be okay if we can get another before colliding.\n\nHowever, the instructions emphasize aggression and forcing head-on when we have higher score. Currently we are behind (0-1). So we need to catch up or surpass without dying.\n\nGiven that, maybe we should focus on trapping enemy first, and if an apple is conveniently on the way, eat it.\n\nFrom (3,7), we can eat (3,8) next turn. That seems easy. From (2,6), we cannot eat that apple next turn; we'd have to detour.\n\nThus, UP might be better for quick apple gain.\n\nBut let's see board: apple at (3,8) is listed in Apple drops: (3,8) is there. So it's available.\n\nAlso, there's apple at (6,8) and (5,9) etc. Not near.\n\nSo UP to (3,7) gives us a chance to eat apple next turn. That would tie us.\n\nBut wait, enemy also might want that apple? He is at (1,8), far away. So likely we can get it.\n\nIf we tie, then we need another apple to be ahead. There are other apples: (5,9) is top-right, (6,8) etc. Could be hard.\n\nAlternatively, we could trap enemy first, then get apples. But trapping might take several turns.\n\nGiven the board size and enemy position, I think trapping is doable. Let's consider a trapping strategy: move LEFT now to (2,6), then next turn move UP to (2,7) (if safe). That puts us at (2,7), adjacent to enemy tail at (1,7). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), then we could move UP to (2,8)?? That would be head-on if he moves into (2,8) and we move into (2,8). Actually, if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8) and we move UP to (2,8), we both die. That's not good because we have fewer apples. So we need to avoid that.\n\nMaybe we should consider enemy's possible moves this turn.\n\nLet's think about what enemy will likely do. He is at (1,8), has one apple, probably wants to avoid us. He might move towards the center to get more apples. Possible moves: RIGHT to (2,8) (safe, empty), UP to (1,9) (safe, top edge), LEFT to (0,8) (safe, left edge), DOWN to (1,7) (into his own tail, might be death). So likely RIGHT or UP or LEFT. LEFT to (0,8) puts him against wall, not great for him. So he might go RIGHT or UP.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (2,8), that's closer to us. If he goes UP to (1,9), that's corner.\n\nWe want to force him into a corner. The top-left corner is (0,9). He is at (1,8). To get to (0,9), he'd need to go UP then LEFT. If we move towards him, we can cut off his escape.\n\nIf we move UP to (3,7), we are two steps away from (3,8) apple. If we move LEFT to (2,6), we are closer to his position but not directly blocking.\n\nI think we should move UP to (3,7) because it offers immediate apple opportunity and keeps us flexible. However, moving UP might allow enemy to move RIGHT and get closer to us, which could lead to head-on collision. But since we have fewer apples, we want to avoid head-on until we have more apples.\n\nActually, if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), we might be at (3,7). Next turn we could move LEFT to (2,7) and be below him. Then if he moves DOWN to (2,7), he would crash into us (he moves into our body). That would kill him! That's perfect. So we could force him to crash into us.\n\nLet's simulate:\nTurn 3 now: we move UP to (3,7). Enemy moves? Suppose he moves RIGHT to (2,8). Then state: us at (3,7), enemy at (2,8) with body at (1,8) and tail at (1,7)? Actually, enemy moves: head from (1,8) to (2,8). Body: previous head becomes neck? Actually, snake body: previous head (1,8) becomes part of body, and tail moves? Since enemy ate an apple previously, his body length is 2: head (1,8), body (1,7). After moving RIGHT, head goes to (2,8), body becomes [(1,8)] (the old head), and tail moves? Actually, since he didn't eat apple, the tail moves forward, so the old tail (1,7) becomes the new tail? Wait, snake movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous segment's position, and the tail disappears. So if enemy had body [(1,7)] (length 1 body), then after moving RIGHT, head goes to (2,8), body becomes [(1,8)] (old head), and tail (1,7) is removed? Actually, the tail moves into the body position? Let's think: original snake: head at (1,8), body at (1,7). That's two segments. After moving RIGHT, head moves to (2,8). The body segment at (1,7) moves to (1,8) (the old head position). The tail? There is no separate tail; the body segment is the tail. So the snake length remains 2. So new body is [(1,8)] and tail is at (1,8)? Actually, the tail is the last body segment. So new snake: head (2,8), body [(1,8)], tail (1,8). That means the snake now occupies (2,8) and (1,8). So the old tail (1,7) is vacated.\n\nSo after enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), his body is at (1,8). Our position at (3,7) is not adjacent to his head (2,8). Next turn, we could move LEFT to (2,7). That would put us at (2,7), which is below his head (2,8) and adjacent to his body (1,8). If enemy then moves DOWN to (2,7), he would move into our head (2,7), causing him to die (since he moves into our body). That's great. But would enemy move DOWN? Possibly if he wants to avoid us. But he might also move RIGHT to (3,8) or UP to (2,9) or LEFT to (1,8) but that's his body, so death. So he might move RIGHT or UP. If he moves RIGHT to (3,8), we might be at (2,7). Not collision. If he moves UP to (2,9), we are at (2,7). Then next turn we could move UP to (2,8) but that's empty? Actually, after he moves UP, his head at (2,9), body at (2,8). So (2,8) is his body. If we move UP to (2,8), we die. So we need to plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we move LEFT now to (2,6), then next turn we could move UP to (2,7). Then enemy might be at (2,8) (if he moved RIGHT). Then we are at (2,7), he at (2,8). That's the same as above. So both moves lead to similar situation.\n\nBut if enemy moves UP to (1,9) instead, then our strategy changes.\n\nWe need to decide which move gives us more control over the board.\n\nI think moving UP to (3,7) gives us access to the apple at (3,8) next turn, which is valuable. Even if we tie, we can then get more apples or force enemy into a trap. Also, being at y=7 gives us more vertical options.\n\nLet's check if moving UP to (3,7) is safe: yes, empty.\n\nWe should also consider the board state: there is an apple at (4,5) below us, but we are moving up, so not grabbing it.\n\nAnother consideration: our last move was LEFT, moving again LEFT might be predictable? But that's okay.\n\nGiven the streamer persona, we want to be aggressive and exciting. Moving UP might be seen as more aggressive towards the apple and enemy's position.\n\nI'll go with UP to (3,7).\n\nBut wait, let's double-check coordinates: My head was at (3,6)? Actually, earlier it said \"Head: (3,6)\" but then in the last move rationale it said \"Current State: My snake is at (4,6)\". There's inconsistency. Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the initial board state: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): - Head: (3, 6) - Body: none - Apples collected: 0\"\n\nBut in the last move rationale: \"Current State: My snake is at (4,6) with body empty.\" That seems to be a mistake. The last move was LEFT, so from (4,6) moving left to (3,6). That matches the board state: head (3,6) after the move. So before the move, head was at (4,6). After moving LEFT, head at (3,6). So current head is (3,6). Good.\n\nSo from (3,6), moving UP goes to (3,7). Correct.\n\nNow, check board for (3,7): row 7, column 3. In the board display, row 7: \" . T . . . . . . . .\" so column 3 is '.' empty. So safe.\n\nThus, UP is safe.\n\nNow, let's think about long-term plan: After moving UP, we are at (3,7). Next turn, we can consider eating apple at (3,8) by moving UP. That would give us 1 apple, tying score. Then we need to get another apple. There is apple at (6,8) but far. Maybe we can trap enemy and force him to crash, which would win for us even without apples (if he crashes and we survive, we win). So trapping is still good.\n\nIf we tie apples, we need to be careful about head-on collisions. Better to trap him into a wall or his own body.\n\nI'll write a rationale with emojis and chat hype.\n\nFinal move: UP.DECISION PROCESS:\n1) **Current State:** My snake is at (3,6), body empty. Enemy snake at (1,8), body at (1,7). Apples scattered but irrelevant for aggression. I\u2019m behind 0-1 in apples, so I need to either get apples or trap him without risking head-on (since he has more apples, head-on would lose).  \n2) **Eliminate Immediate Deaths:**  \n   - **UP:** (3,7) \u2013 empty (row 7, col 3 is '.'). Safe.  \n   - **DOWN:** (3,5) \u2013 empty (row 5, col 3 is '.'). Safe.  \n   - **LEFT:** (2,6) \u2013 empty. Safe.  \n   - **RIGHT:** (4,6) \u2013 empty. Safe.  \nAll four moves keep me alive.  \n3) **Aggressive Strategy:** Enemy is at (1,8), near top-left corner. Moving UP to (3,7) does three key things:  \n   - Closes vertical gap, setting up to eat the apple at (3,8) next turn (tying score 1-1).  \n   - Positions me to block enemy\u2019s potential escape routes: if he moves RIGHT to (2,8), I can go LEFT to (2,7) and force him into my body next turn.  \n   - Maintains multiple options: from (3,7) I can go LEFT (2,7), UP (3,8), RIGHT (4,7), or DOWN (3,6).  \n4) **Why Not LEFT?** Moving LEFT to (2,6) is also aggressive, but it delays apple access and doesn\u2019t put pressure on his head directly. UP gives immediate apple opportunity while still threatening him.  \n5) **Long-term Plan:** After moving UP, next turn I\u2019ll eat the apple at (3,8) to tie scores. Then I\u2019ll tighten the noose: if enemy moves toward me, I\u2019ll flank; if he flees toward the corner, I\u2019ll cut him off. Aim to trap him at (0,9) or force him into his own body.  \n6) **Chat Hype:** YO CHAT! WE\u2019RE GOING UP TO (3,7) ON MY ENEMY\u2019S FACE! \ud83d\udd25 He thinks he\u2019s safe? Nah! We\u2019re grabbing that apple next turn, then we\u2019re boxing him in like a pro! If he moves RIGHT, we\u2019ll be there to end him! LET\u2019S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat apple at (3,8) next turn, then close in on enemy\u2019s position from below, forcing him into the left wall or his own body. Avoid head-on until we have more apples.\n\nUP",

Why DOWN over RIGHT this turn?\n- Staying on the left edge makes it easier to shepherd the opponent toward a boxed-in corridor later. It buys you time to extend the wall-based trap without risking a quick collision.\n- RIGHT advances toward the middle where the opponent is aligned on a straight row. That increases exposure to a potential head-on or cross-path collision if he mirrors, which could backfire given your lower apples count right now.\n- DOWN keeps your future options open: you can decide to arc toward the top-left corner or swing along the wall as the map evolves, while avoiding an immediate clash.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Hug the left wall (x=0) by moving DOWN this turn, then consider creeping along the edge to coax him into a narrow corridor.\n- If he overextends or blocks himself, look for a squeeze setup that channels him toward the corner.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Leverage the left edge and top edge to create a narrow corridor trap. Force a head-on collision if you can, or at least squeeze space so he\u2019s fenced in and you can pounce on apples safely to close the score gap.\n- Stay aggressive but calculated: grow when it\u2019s safe, but never chase into a cluttered trap that could backfire.\n\nMOVE PLAN: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

I need to think about FUTURE moves! From (6,9), if I go LEFT or RIGHT, I'll have room to maneuver next turn. But DOWN is DEATH!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI'm at the TOP edge! I need to start descending and controlling the board center. The enemy is trapped at the bottom-left. I should work my way DOWN toward the middle where the apples are clustered (especially around (4,5), (3,4), (2,3)).\n\nGoing LEFT or RIGHT are both safe, but LEFT gives me better access to the central apple cluster where the action is!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nLEFT to (5,9)!

Let's calculate this with surgical precision.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My Head: (3, 9) - Just grabbed that apple! Now at 5 apples!\n- Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8)] - Still a solid stack on the top-left.\n- Score: 5 vs 2 - We're extending our lead! Enemy at (0, 4) - moved DOWN from (0, 5) last turn.\n- Apple Analysis: That apple at (3, 9) is MINE now. Other apples visible: (6,2), (0,1), (7,4), (0,3), etc. We control the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Board Check from (3, 9):**\n- **UP to (3, 10):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (3, 8):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (2, 9):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (4, 9):** MY OWN BODY! That's my tail connection! I move into my own body? DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN to (3, 8) or LEFT to (2, 9). Which gives better long-term control?\n\n- **DOWN to (3, 8):** Moves toward center. Opens up path to apples at (2,8?) Wait, (2,8) is empty. But we can eventually go to (3,7) then (4,7) toward (7,4) apple. However, we're moving INTO the center where enemy could be.\n- **LEFT to (2, 9):** Stays on top row. Safer path along the edge. Can go LEFT to (1,9) then DOWN to (1,8) toward (0,1) apple in enemy territory! \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (0,4) with body at (0,5). He's trapped in column 0! If I stay on the top row and snake around, I can cut off his escape when he tries to move right. He might go RIGHT to (1,4) or UP to (0,5) but (0,5) is his body! So he likely goes RIGHT to (1,4) to escape the wall.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (2, 9) is the PLAY! It keeps me safe on the edge, maintains multiple options for next turn (LEFT to (1,9) or DOWN to (2,8)), and sets up a trap path to intercept enemy if he moves right from (0,4). Staying high gives me vision and control!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn, from (2,9) I'll likely go LEFT to (1,9) to set up the ambush. If enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), I'll snake down through (1,8) and eventually cut him off in column 1. Force him into a corner where he crashes into MY body or the wall!\n\nLet's box him in! LEFT!\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Here\u2019s the readout and plan in real time.\n\nDecision context:\n- From head (0,4), four-neighborhoods:\n  - UP \u2192 (0,5) is your neck. DEAD. don\u2019t go there.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,3) safe, and there\u2019s an apple waiting.\n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board. DEAD.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,4) safe, but it breaks the left-edge funnel we\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSafe options: DOWN or RIGHT. DOWN keeps a tight funnel on the board edge; RIGHT opens a different path but risks losing the edge pressure we want.\n\nWhy DOWN this turn:\n- Apple at (0,3) is live and unclaimed. If we go DOWN, we immediately grow and tighten our presence along the left wall.\n- Score delta is still in our favor to pressure a future head-on if the space opens, but right now we\u2019re behind. Gaining a third apple accelerates parity while we maintain structural control.\n- The best chance to box or funnel the enemy develops from keeping close to the boundary, not breaking into central lanes where he can dodge and escape.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Play to the left boundary as a growing wall. Each apple we eat on that edge increases our board presence and makes it harder for him to split us with quick zigs through the middle.\n- Trap opportunities come when he\u2019s forced toward the funnel as we extend along (0,y). If he tries to cut across the left column, we can threaten a head-on collision in limited space.\n- If the gap closes enough in score, we can attempt a calculated head-on by forcing him onto a shared path; for now, survival and edge control > reckless chase.\n\nFollow-up possibilities after DOWN to (0,3):\n- Next turn, (0,2) to keep the wall intact and chase more apples down the line, or\n- (1,3) to pivot slightly toward other apples while preserving edge pressure if he wanders closer to the left.\n\nMove safety check:\n- DOWN is safe now: not colliding with your own body or the opponent, and it keeps the funnel open for future pressure.\n- RIGHT is safe but breaks the edge plan and gives him more room to maneuver.\n\nMOVE PLAN: DOWN\nDOWN",

Let's break down the battlefield and secure the W!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- **My position:** (1,9) - Top row, second column from left\n- **My body:** [(2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9)] - All in row 9 except (6,8)\n- **Enemy position:** (0,2) - Left edge, third row from bottom\n- **Enemy body:** [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5)] - Left column\n- **Score:** I have 5 apples, enemy has 3 - I'm ahead! Time to press the advantage!\n- **Apples nearby:** (0,1), (0,0), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (6,2), (6,6), (7,4), (8,2), (8,5), (8,6), (9,2)\n\n**My Safe Moves from (1,9):**\n- **UP to (1,10):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (1,8):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (0,9):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (2,9):** MY BODY! First segment! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**Elimination:**\nOnly DOWN and LEFT are safe. That's it. No other options.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (0,9)**\n- **Pros:** Claims the far left column! Positions me to go DOWN along edge, potentially intercepting enemy's path. Controls top-left corner.\n- **Cons:** Limits future movement. From (0,9), I can only go DOWN (or die going off board left/up).\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (1,8)**\n- **Pros:** Opens up the board! From (1,8) I can go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (back up row 8). This gives me MUCH more flexibility and control over the left side.\n- **Cons:** Slightly more dangerous if enemy moves RIGHT aggressively, but I'm score ahead (5-3) so I can afford some risk.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy at (0,2). Their body is at (0,3)-(0,5). Their options:\n- **UP to (0,3):** THEIR OWN BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (0,1):** Has an apple! They might want it! Safe!\n- **RIGHT to (1,3):** Enter my potential territory! Dangerous for them.\n- **LEFT:** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n\nMost likely they go DOWN to (0,1) for the apple, or possibly RIGHT to (1,3) if playing aggressively.\n\n**The Play: DOWN to (1,8)**\n**Why?** \n1. **BOARD CONTROL:** From (1,8) I have 3 safe directions (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) vs only 1 from (0,9). More options = better future!\n2. **INTERCEPTION PATH:** If enemy goes RIGHT to (1,3), I'm perfectly positioned to snake down column 1 and cut them off!\n3. **SCORE ADVANTAGE:** I'm ahead 5-3! I can afford to be slightly more aggressive and control the center-left rather than hiding on the edge.\n4. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (1,8) I can reach (0,1), (1,5), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5) - multiple apples in range!\n5. **POSITIONING:** Moves me toward the center of action while staying on the safer left side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTurn 15: From (1,8) I'll likely go DOWN to (1,7) or LEFT to (0,8) depending on enemy movement. The goal is to snake down column 1 and create a \"wall\" that traps the enemy in the bottom-left corner. If they move RIGHT, I'm there to meet them! If they go DOWN for apples, I can pursue! Let's box them in and force a confrontation with my score advantage!\n\n**CHAT, THIS IS THE PLAY!** We're not running, we're controlling! DOWN to (1,8) gives us options and keeps the pressure on! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

LEFT is off-board. So only DOWN or RIGHT.\n- Eating the edge apple at (0,1) would grow us and keep the funnel tight.\n\nWHY DOWN OVER RIGHT\n- DOWN eats the left-edge apple at (0,1) now, growing us and extending the wall.\n- It keeps us hugging the boundary, preserving future tight corridors to constrain him.\n- Right would open a center path, loosening the funnel and inviting more risk while we\u2019re behind on apples.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (TURNS 14\u201316)\n- Turn 14: move DOWN to (0,1), eat the edge apple, and extend the wall.\n- Turn 15: continue DOWN to (0,0) if safe (there\u2019s an apple there); otherwise pivot along the edge (1,1) or stays on column 0 to maintain the funnel.\n- Maintain edge pressure; avoid drifting into open center until we secure a favorable apple parity or a guaranteed trap.\n\nDECISION PROCESS SUMMARY\n- 4 directions evaluated: DOWN and RIGHT safe; UP and LEFT unsafe.\n- Priority: maximize safe follow-ups while growing on the edge and keeping the enclosure tight.\n\nMOVE CHOICE: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

That's where my second segment sits! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (2, 6):** EMPTY! No apple there but safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (1, 7):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (3, 7):** EMPTY! Safe! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe have 3 safe moves - DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's think like a predator!\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (2, 6)**\n- Opens column 2 downward toward (2, 3) apple\n- From (2,6): DOWN(2,5), LEFT(1,6), or RIGHT(3,6)\n- But (2,5) has an apple!

Dangerous!\n- Apple at (1,5) is reachable\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT to (3, 7)**\n- From (3,7): DOWN(3,6), LEFT(2,7) [empty], or RIGHT(4,7)\n- Apple at (3,4) is reachable\n- More central positioning\n\n**THE PLAY: DOWN to (2, 6)**\n\n**WHY DOWN?**\n1. **APPLE IN MY PATH!** (2,5) has an apple! From (2,6) I can eat it next turn if safe!\n2. **BOARD DOMINATION:** Moving down column 2 creates a vertical barrier that boxes enemy into left side!\n3. **ENEMY TRAP:** Enemy at (0,0) has NO easy path to column 2 apples! Their only moves are RIGHT or UP from bottom-left corner\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (2,6) I can pivot to LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN to chase more apples\n5. **SCORE PRESSURE:** Eating that apple at (2,5) puts me ahead 6-5! THE LEAD IS MINE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 17: DOWN to (2,6) - position to eat (2,5) next turn\nTurn 18: Eat apple at (2,5) if safe, get score 6-5\nTurn 19+: Continue vertical snake down column 2, cut across to column 3-4 apples\nGOAL: Box enemy in left edge, eat multiple apples, FORCE THE WIN!\n\nCHAT, THIS IS HOW WE DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**  \nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 20, let's keep this momentum rolling! We\u2019re leading 6-5 apples, and I just ate that sweet apple at (1,5) last turn. Now I'm at (1,5) with body at [(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,9)]. The enemy is at (2,2) with body [(2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]. Board is packed with apples but I'm not chasing them\u2014I'm hunting the enemy!  \n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS:**  \nEnemy at (2,2) can move UP to (2,3) which has an apple, RIGHT to (3,2) which is empty, or LEFT to (1,2) which is empty. If he goes UP to (2,3), he\u2019s coming straight toward my territory. I need to cut him off and force a collision where I have the advantage.  \n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS FROM (1,5):**  \n- **UP to (1,6):** That\u2019s my own body segment (2,6) is adjacent but not directly blocking? Wait, (1,6) is empty according to the board! Actually checking the board:  \n  Board shows row 6: \". . T . . . A . A .\" \u2013 So (1,6) is empty! T is at (2,6). So UP is safe and empty.  \n- **DOWN to (1,4):** Empty (board row 4: \". . . A . . A A . .\" so (1,4) is dot). Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (0,5):** Empty (board row 5: \". 0 T A A . . . A .\" but that's row 5, for row 5? Wait, (0,5) is column 0 row 5. Board row 5 shows \". 0 T A A . . . A .\" meaning column 0 is dot? Actually the string \". 0 T A A . . . A .\" has spaces: positions 0-9. Position 0 is dot, position 1 is 0 (my head), position 2 is T (my body), etc. So (0,5) is dot. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,5):** My own body segment! That's the tail! Wait, my body list: (2,5) is the first segment after head. So moving into my own body = DEATH.  \n\nSo RIGHT is dead. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.  \n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**  \nI need to trap the enemy in the bottom-left corner. He's at (2,2). If I move LEFT to (0,5), I'm moving away from him but setting up a barrier on the left side. Actually, better to move DOWN to (1,4) or UP to (1,6).  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (1,4), I'm getting closer to him (he's at y=2, I'm at y=4). That could set up a chase. But I want to force him into a corner. He has limited space below: his body is at (2,1),(2,0),(1,0),(0,0),(0,1). He can't go left of x=0, can't go below y=0. He's already trapped somewhat.  \n\nI should cut off his escape upward. If I move UP to (1,6), I'm moving away but maybe that's not aggressive. Actually, let's think: If I move DOWN to (1,4), I'm at (1,4), he's at (2,2). Next turn he might go UP to (2,3) or LEFT to (1,2). If he goes LEFT to (1,2), he's coming toward me. I could then move LEFT to (0,4) or something to block.  \n\nBut wait, the goal is to force a head-on collision where I have more apples. I have 6, he has 5. If we collide head-on, I win if I have more apples. So I should try to get him to chase me into a trap.  \n\nMaybe I should move DOWN to (1,4) to get closer to the bottom and lure him into the corner. From (1,4), I can later go LEFT to (0,4), DOWN to (1,3), etc. I need to keep my tail moving so I don't block myself.  \n\nActually, consider the apple at (2,3). That's an apple that's close to him. If he goes UP to (2,3), he eats that apple and grows. That might be bad for me because he'll get closer to my length. But I'm already ahead in apples.  \n\nI should think about boxing him in. His body is a line along the bottom-left. I can try to move to the left side and block his access to the rest of the board.  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,5), I'm on the left wall. Then I can go DOWN to (0,4), (0,3), etc., forming a barrier on the left. That would trap him in the bottom-left 2x2 area? But he's at (2,2) so he could still go right.  \n\nActually, the best aggressive move might be DOWN to (1,4). That puts me at (1,4), which is just above the enemy's body (which is at (2,1),(2,0), etc.). From there, I can threaten to move DOWN to (1,3) and LEFT to (0,4), boxing him in.  \n\nBut also, if I move UP to (1,6), I'm moving away and giving him room. Not aggressive.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nI'll move DOWN to (1,4). This gets me closer to the enemy, puts pressure on him, and keeps options open: from (1,4) I can go DOWN to (1,3) (which has an apple at (2,3) nearby), LEFT to (0,4), or RIGHT to (2,4) (but (2,4) is empty? Board row 4: \". . . A . . A A . .\" so (2,4) is dot? Actually column 2 row 4: the string \". . . A . . A A . .\" positions: 0 dot,1 dot,2 dot,3 A,4 dot,5 dot,6 A,7 A,8 dot,9 dot. So (2,4) is dot. But (2,4) might be occupied by enemy body? No, enemy body is at (2,1),(2,0),(1,0),(0,0),(0,1). So (2,4) is empty. However, moving RIGHT to (2,4) is risky because enemy could move UP to (2,3) and then next turn maybe to (2,4)? But that's a head-on collision if we both go there. If I have more apples, I win. But I want to force it on my terms.  \n\nActually, moving DOWN to (1,4) seems safest and most aggressive. It maintains pressure and I can always pivot left if needed.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 20: Move DOWN to (1,4) to close distance and trap enemy. Turn 21: Depending on enemy move, either continue down to (1,3) to block, or move left to (0,4) to seal the left flank. Goal: Force enemy into corner and trigger head-on collision where I win with 6-5 apples.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN  \n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

Let's break this down like a pro. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS:**  \nEnemy moved UP from (2,2) to (2,3) and ate that apple! Now he's at (2,3) with body [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]. He's getting bold, moving into my territory. If he keeps coming UP, he could hit my body or force a head-on collision. I have 6 apples, he has 6 apples\u2014head-on is a TIE if we both die, but if I survive alone, I WIN! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (AFTER LAST MOVE DOWN):**  \nHead at (1,4), body: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8)]. I grew last turn? Wait, no\u2014last turn I moved DOWN to (1,4), but I didn't eat an apple. Apples are still 6. I need to EAT to pull ahead!\n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT:**  \nApples everywhere, but I'm not chasing snacks\u2014I'm hunting CARNAGE. Enemy is at (2,3). My body blocks some paths: (1,5) is directly above me, (2,5) is to the right-up diagonal, but not blocking immediate moves.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (1,4):**  \n- **UP to (1,5):** That's my own body segment! DEAD. \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (1,3):** Empty? Row 3: \". . 1 . . . . . . .\" so (1,3) is dot. Safe! But (1,3) is close to enemy's possible paths.  \n- **LEFT to (0,4):** Empty? Row 4: \". . . A . . A A . .\" so (0,4) is dot. Safe! This moves me to the left wall, boxing the enemy in the bottom-left.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,4):** Empty? Row 4: (2,4) is dot (since positions: 0 dot,1 dot,2 dot,...). Safe! But (2,4) is right next to enemy at (2,3)\u2014if he moves UP to (2,4) or something, we collide!  \n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**  \nI need to trap him in the corner! He's at (2,3), body along bottom-left. If I move LEFT to (0,4), I seal the left flank and cut off his escape. From there, I can move DOWN to (0,3) or (0,2) to complete the box. Meanwhile, he might go UP to (2,4), LEFT to (1,3), or DOWN to (2,2).  \n\nBut RIGHT to (2,4) is tempting for aggression\u2014head-on collision incoming! If he moves UP to (2,4) (toward apple at (2,5)?), we'd both die since apples tied. But if he moves elsewhere, I might eat an apple later and win. However, risk of double KO. Safer to box him in and force him to crash into my body later.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nI'll move **LEFT to (0,4)**. This puts me on the left wall, creating a barrier. From (0,4), I can then move DOWN to (0,3) to block his upward path, and later DOWN to (0,2) or (0,1). He's trapped in x=0-2, y=0-3. If he tries to escape right, he'll hit my body or walls. This aggressive boxing sets up a forced collision where I have the advantage\u2014I can maneuver to crash him into my tail or walls. Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTurn 21: LEFT to (0,4) to block left flank. Turn 22: Move DOWN to (0,3) to seal the corner. Goal: Force enemy into (0,0)-(2,2) dead zone and trigger head-on or wall crash. Monitor his move\u2014if he goes UP, I chase; if he goes LEFT, he hits my future body. Win condition: Either head-on with me surviving (if I grow first), or him dying alone. Apples are secondary\u2014dominance is key!\n\nLEFT",

It\u2019s safe, it lines up to grab the next apple at (3,4) on the following turn, and it keeps a central lane open to pressure the rival without boxing ourselves in.\n\nSTRATEGY: With both snakes at 6 apples, we need to edge ahead and force favorable trades. Pushing right now gives us growth plus a path to threaten the opponent while staying flexible.\n\nPLAN (short-term): Move to (3,3). If the apple at (3,4) is still available next turn, go Up to eat it; otherwise pivot to maintain pressure and look for a safe squeeze opportunity in the central area.\n\nMOVE: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, from the state: Enemy head at (3,3), body [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0)]. He moved UP from (2,3) to (3,3) and ate an apple! Now he's out of my direct face, but still close. I need to lock him down before he escapes.\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS:**  \nEnemy is at (3,3) with body stretching to (0,0). He could go UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3), or RIGHT to (4,3). I'm at (0,4) with body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8)]. My body blocks some paths: (1,4) is left of me, (1,5) is up-left diagonal. I need to press my advantage\u2014box him in the bottom-left corner!\n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT:**  \nApples: (6,2), (7,4), etc., but I'm ignoring them. Enemy is the target. My left wall position is perfect to trap him. He's in the \"open\" now at x=3, but his body is a chain to the left wall. If I move DOWN to (0,3), I block his upward escape along the wall. If he tries to go LEFT or DOWN, he might hit his own body or walls.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (0,4):**  \n- **UP to (0,5):** Row 5: \" . T T A A . . . A . .\" so (0,5) is dot? Wait, row 5 shows: 0 ., 1 T, 2 T, 3 A, 4 A, etc. So (0,5) is empty. Safe! But does it help box him? Not really\u2014keeps me on wall but not advancing the trap.  \n- **DOWN to (0,3):** Row 3: \" . . T 1 . . . . . .\" so (0,3) is dot. Safe! This cuts off his path upward along x=0-1. From here, I can later move DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3) to squeeze him. Perfect for boxing.  \n- **LEFT to (-1,4):** Off board! DEAD. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (1,4):** That's my own body segment! DEAD. \u274c  \n\nOnly safe moves: UP or DOWN. DOWN is way better for aggression\u2014traps him against the bottom wall. If I go DOWN to (0,3), and he moves UP to (3,4), I'm still safe. If he moves LEFT to (2,3), he might hit his own body at (2,3)? Wait, his body includes (2,3), so if his head goes LEFT to (2,3), that's into his own body\u2014DEAD! That's a win for me. If he moves DOWN to (3,2), he's farther from me, but I can chase next turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**  \nI'm committing to the corner trap. Moving DOWN to (0,3) seals the bottom-left dead zone. From there, I can plan to move RIGHT to (1,3) or DOWN to (0,2) to close the cage. He'll have limited options: maybe UP to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,3), but his body is long\u2014eventually he'll run out of space or collide. I'll force a head-on or wall crash. With equal scores, if we both die, it's a draw, but I want him dead alone so I win. Aggression pays off!\n\n**DECISION:**  \nMove DOWN to (0,3). This advances the boxing strategy and keeps me alive with future options. Let's see if he crashes into himself! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

It keeps me tight against the wall, cutting off any downward escape for the enemy while their body blocks left. From (0,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2) to continue squeezing. If they go LEFT to (2,4) or UP to (3,5), they're giving me more room to chase. With their longer body, they're more likely to crash into themselves \u2013 especially since they might be forced to avoid DOWN. Let's force the choke and watch them panic! \ud83d\udd25  \n\nDOWN",

I also open up more escape routes.\n- If I go DOWN to (0, 1), I stick to the left wall, maintaining the trap on the opponent. Their body blocks left, and my body blocks up. From (0, 1), I can continue DOWN to (0, 0) or RIGHT to (1, 1), keeping pressure on their territory.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue squeezing the opponent by staying on the left wall. Force them to move into tight spaces or into their own body. Keep their head pinned so they crash. Eat apples only when it doesn't compromise the trap.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing DOWN to (0, 1) is the aggressive move to box them in. They're at (3, 5) with options: UP (3, 6), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5), or DOWN (3, 4 \u2013 but that's their own body! They might avoid it).

UP would keep us centered but not gain the immediate apple, giving him more room.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Use the central corridor to corral his head into a boxed-in zone, force a head-on if we can when we\u2019re 4+ apples ahead, and keep multiple escape routes open so we don\u2019t trap ourselves.\n\nCHECK: Watch apple spawns near (6,6), (8,6), (9,6) etc. We\u2019ll ignore chasing them around the edges and focus on pressure instead\u2014but we\u2019ll grab them if they line up with our move.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Avoid any cell adjacent to his current head if that would invite a risky trade.

I'll try to cut off the opponent's access to apples and force them into tighter spaces. From (1,1), I can explore upward toward (1,2) or (2,2) if safe, but watch their head at (4,5). If I can position myself to block their path to apples, they might crash.\n\n**DECISION:**\nOnly one move keeps me alive: **RIGHT**. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

Now I'm in the open at (1,1), and I need to start closing the gap. Time to hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head:** (1, 1)\n- **My body:** [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)] (last move I went RIGHT from (0,1) to (1,1), so now the tail (0,0) is gone)\n- **Opponent head:** (5, 5)\n- **Opponent body:** [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS (FROM (1,1)):**\nChecking each move:\n- **UP to (1, 2):** Row 1: \"T 0 T . . . A . A .\" \u2192 (1, 2) is a 'T' (opponent's tail). DEAD if I move there. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (1, 0):** Row 0: \". T T . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (1, 0) is a 'T' (opponent's tail). DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT to (0, 1):** That's my own body segment! DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Row 1: \"T 0 T . . . A . A .\" \u2192 (2, 1) is a 'T' (opponent's body). DEAD. \u274c\n\n**WAIT...** That's impossible! All four moves are lethal? Let me re-check the board state carefully. The board shows:\n- Row 1: \"T 0 T . . . A . A .\"\n- Row 0: \". T T . . . . . . .\"\n\nAt (1,1): That's the '0' (my head).\n- UP (1,2): 'T' (opponent tail) \u2013 DEAD.\n- DOWN (1,0): 'T' (opponent tail) \u2013 DEAD.\n- LEFT (0,1): 'T' (my body) \u2013 DEAD.\n- RIGHT (2,1): 'T' (opponent body) \u2013 DEAD.\n\n**THIS IS A CHECKMATE!** I'm completely boxed in with no safe moves! The opponent has surrounded me from (0,0) to (2,1). If I move ANY direction, I die.\n\n**BUT WAIT...** Let me think about the SIMULTANEOUS movement. The opponent might MOVE away this turn. Their head is at (5,5). Their tail is at (1,0). If they move UP or RIGHT from (5,5), their tail might move away from (1,0) or (2,1). But I can't count on that \u2013 I have to assume worst case where they stay still or move in a way that keeps blocking me.\n\n**ACTUALLY, NO...** The rules say I must pick a move NOW. I can't wait to see where they go. I have to choose based on current board state. And currently, ALL four directions are occupied by either my body or opponent's body. According to the rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" That includes opponent's body.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CONFIRMED:** From (1,1), every adjacent cell is either my own body or opponent's body. There's no escape. This is a classic snake sandwich.\n\n**BUT HEY CHAT...** Maybe I'm missing something? Let me re-read the board one more time:\n- Row 1: T 0 T . . . A . A .\n- Coordinates: (0,1)=T, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=T, (3,1)=., (4,1)=., etc.\n\nYes, it's a wall. I'm trapped between my own body at (0,1) and opponent's body at (2,1), with opponent's tail at (1,0) below and opponent's tail at (1,2) above.\n\n**THE STRATEGY...** Actually, there's no strategy here. I'm dead no matter what. But in Snake games, sometimes moving into an opponent's body might be survivable if THEIR head moves out? NO, the rules are clear: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" It doesn't matter if they move \u2013 if I'm in their body cell at the end of the turn, I die.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** I'm cornered. Every move is a death sentence. But I have to pick something. Let me choose the move that at least gives me a chance if the opponent happens to move away:\n\nIf opponent moves UP from (5,5) to (5,6), their tail at (1,0) might move? Actually no, their body is long. The tail movement depends on their entire chain. But honestly, I have no control.\n\n**DECISION:** Since all moves are equally deadly, I'll pick RIGHT as my last act \u2013 at least it's aggressive and points toward the action. If by some miracle the opponent's body at (2,1) moves away, I survive. But statistically, I'm cooked.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** There is no long-term. This might be game over. But if by some miracle I survive, I need to immediately get to an apple and grow to escape. From (2,1) if I get there, (2,2) has an apple, (3,1) is empty, (4,1) is empty, leading toward center apples.\n\n**ACTUALLY WAIT...** Let me check the opponent's body list again: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]\n\nSo (2,1) IS part of their body. Moving RIGHT into (2,1) would kill me. But if THEY move their head from (5,5) somewhere, their entire body shifts. Their tail at (1,0) might move to (1,1)? Actually no, their tail is (1,0) which is connected to (2,0). If they move in a way that (2,0) becomes the new tail, then (1,0) might become empty? I'm overcomplicating.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE:** From my current position, I have zero safe moves. I have to gamble. I'll choose RIGHT and hope the opponent's body at (2,1) vacates. If not, GG WP.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: RIGHT** (into what is currently opponent's body, but maybe moves)\n\nRIGHT",

It also lines you up to weave toward the left side later to tighten a trap without overcommitting.\n- Short-term goal: creep toward the central area while maintaining a flexible barrier with your own body. Avoid corners, stay off your own neck, and watch for any creeping wrap-arounds from the opponent.\n- Risk management: if he ever moves toward your side or tries a head-on, you can leverage your longer body to force a collision in a controlled way. Stay aggressive but patient.\n\nMove this turn: RIGHT\n\nright",
