This increases my distance to it to 6, while the enemy is also 6 steps away. By not moving towards (1, 8) (which LEFT would do), I implicitly cede that race, encouraging the enemy to go for that isolated top-left apple. If the enemy commits to (1, 8), they will be far from the rich bottom section of the board, allowing me to sweep (1, 4), (1, 3), and potentially (5, 2).\n3. **Flexibility**: Moving DOWN keeps me centrally located relative to the y-axis for the bottom apples, maintaining a threat on (5, 2) (distance 4 after move) should the enemy ignore (1, 8).\n\nLong-term plan: Move DOWN, then turn LEFT to collect the apple at (1, 4), then move DOWN to collect the apple at (1, 3).\n\nDOWN",

There are other apples at (7, 1) and (5, 2) which are to the East (Right), and two at (1, 8) and (1, 9) which are far North near the enemy.\n3.  **Enemy position**: The enemy is at the top of the board (y=9). Calculating distance, the enemy is too far to pose a collision threat this turn. The enemy is likely to contest the apples at (1, 9) and (1, 8).\n4.  **Move evaluation**:\n    *   **DOWN (to 1, 0)**: This move is safe, valid (inside board), and immediately allows me to consume an apple. It positions me at the bottom edge of the board.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 2, 1)**: This is safe but moves away from the immediate apple. If I move RIGHT, my body moves into (1, 1), blocking the direct vertical path back to the apple at (1, 0). It is inefficient to skip the adjacent apple.\n    *   **LEFT (to 0, 1)**: Moving left puts me in a corner column (x=0) with my body blocking the path to the right, restricting movement options closer to a dead end.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Taking the apple at (1, 0) is the optimal move. It grants a point/length and puts me in a position to easily traverse to the right side of the board (y=0 or y=1 corridor) to target the next closest apples at (5, 2) and (7, 1).\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (1, 0) to consume the apple. Then turn RIGHT towards (2, 0) to proceed towards the apple at (5, 2).\n\nDOWN",
