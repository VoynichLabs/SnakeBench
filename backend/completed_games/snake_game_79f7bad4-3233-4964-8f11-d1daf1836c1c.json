The enemy snake is at position (1, 3).\n\nGiven the current state, it seems like the best move would be to go RIGHT to position (1, 4) to get closer to the apple at (1, 9). This will allow me to potentially reach that apple and grow my snake. Additionally, going RIGHT will not cause me to run into the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving RIGHT, as long as it is safe to do so, to try and reach the apple at (1, 9).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
