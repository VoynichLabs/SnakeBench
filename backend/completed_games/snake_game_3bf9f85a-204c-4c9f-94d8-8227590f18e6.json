UP helps toward (2,6) but that apple is farther.\n- Head-on collision risk: enemy is at (9,2), far away; they cannot reach any of my candidate next cells this turn, so head-on collision is not a concern this move.\n- Follow-up flexibility: moving DOWN keeps me in open space with multiple escape options (up back to current row, left/right, or further down). It advances me toward nearby apples while keeping options open.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Continue toward the nearest reachable apple (prioritize (6,1) or (1,2) depending on enemy movements). If the enemy approaches the same apple, switch to the next-closest apple to avoid head-on fights. Maintain open-space moves (avoid getting boxed against walls) and prefer routes that leave multiple exit options.\n\nMOVE:\nDOWN",

My three safe options are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nLooking at remaining apples and their distances:\n- (8, 0): 4 moves away (LEFT, then up around)\n- (1, 0): 3 moves away (but very close to enemy snake #0)\n- (8, 8): 7 moves away\n- (9, 8): 8 moves away\n- (6, 6): 5 moves away\n\nThe closest apple is (1, 0), which is 3 moves away if I go LEFT twice then DOWN. However, this brings me very close to the enemy snake #0 at (1, 2), creating potential collision risk.\n\n**Path planning:**\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1) now, my path to (1, 0) would be: (3, 1) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 0). The enemy snake is at (1, 2), so there's some buffer.\n\nHowever, looking at the board, I should also consider future flexibility. LEFT to (3, 1) followed by another LEFT to (2, 1) would still keep me relatively safe while positioning me well for either (1, 0) or to loop around to other apples.\n\n**Risk assessment and next move:**\nLEFT to (3, 1) is a safe move that:\n1. Keeps me alive\n2. Maintains flexibility (I can still go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (3, 1))\n3. Positions me closer to the (1, 0) apple\n4. Maintains distance from the enemy snake at (1, 2)\n\nRIGHT to (5, 1) is also safe but moves me away from the cluster of apples. DOWN to (4, 0) is safe but limits my options more.\n\nLEFT seems like the strategically sound move here.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move LEFT toward the (1, 0) apple while monitoring enemy movements. If the enemy snake #0 threatens to cut me off, I'll pivot toward (8, 0) or other available apples.\n\nLEFT",

There is no occupied enemy body at (1,0).\n\nShort plan after this move:\n- Eat the apple at (1,0) this turn to go up a point (lead the score 9\u20138). After eating, reassess enemy movement and nearby apples ((8,0), (8,8), (6,6)).

My three safe options are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\nLooking at remaining apples and their distances from (3, 1):\n- (1, 0): 3 moves away (LEFT twice, then DOWN)\n- (8, 0): 6 moves away\n- (6, 6): 5 moves away\n- (8, 8): 7 moves away\n- (9, 8): 8 moves away\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (1, 1) with its body segments at (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), etc. If I go LEFT to (2, 1), I'll be adjacent to the enemy head at (1, 1). This creates collision risk if the enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 1) on the same turn.\n\n**Path planning and risk assessment:**\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 1), there's moderate risk of head-on collision with the enemy (depending on their move). However, this does position me closer to the (1, 0) apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 2) or DOWN to (3, 0), I maintain safer distance from the enemy while keeping options open.\n\n**Short-term plan:** I'll go LEFT toward the (1, 0) apple, but I need to be aware that the enemy snake at (1, 1) might also be targeting this nearby apple. If the enemy moves toward the apple, I'll need to pivot on subsequent moves.\n\nLEFT",
