          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are live! Turn 0, the game is just starting! Can we get a clean first move? Hype me up in the chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 0):**\nBoard size is 10x10. We're tiny, just the head!\nMy head: (0, 1). Opponent's head (Snake #0): (1, 4).\nApples are scattered. I see an apple right next to me at (0, 5) and (3, 5). Also (3, 4).\n\n**Goals for this Turn:**\n1. Survive, obviously. We don't want a **FIRST BLOOD** moment!\n2. Get to an area of the board where we can control the enemy's movement, or at least grab an apple without interference.\n3. Start the hunt! We need those points!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 1):**\n\n*   **UP (0, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward the center and potentially towards the apple at (3, 5) or (0, 5). This seems like a great opening move, hugging the left wall for security but heading for points.\n*   **DOWN (0, 0):** Leads us to the bottom edge. Safe, but less appealing than UP as there are no immediate apples and it limits future movement on the next turn.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 1):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Off the board. C'mon, Chat, we're not throwing already! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **RIGHT (1, 1):** Safe. Moves us towards the center and an apple at (2, 1) or potentially (3, 4). This move puts us further from the opponent initially, which is fine since we are short.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe opponent (0) is at (1, 4). They are likely heading towards (3, 4) (APPLE) or maybe (1, 5) (APPLE).\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 1), I stay on the bottom half, which has a decent concentration of apples like (2, 1) and (5, 1).\nIf I move UP to (0, 2), I hug the left wall, moving towards (0, 5).\n\nSince we are so short, proximity to the enemy is not a huge factor yet, but controlling space is. Moving UP along the wall gives us safety and takes us towards isolated apples on the left side of the board (0, 5 is a juicy target). Moving RIGHT opens us up to meeting the enemy sooner, possibly in the middle horizontal lanes.\n\nLet's prioritize position and safety. Moving UP keeps us out of the main traffic area while securing the edge. We can always peel RIGHT later. The apple at (0, 5) is a good early target.\n\n**Predicted Enemy Move (Snake #0 at (1, 4)):**\nThey'll probably go RIGHT to (2, 4) or UP to (1, 5) to grab apples quickly. If they go to (1, 5), they eat an apple. If they go to (2, 4), they are just maneuvering. I bet on them heading for the closest apple, which is (3, 4) or (1, 5).\n\n*If Opponent moves RIGHT to (2, 4):* I'm at (0, 2). Good distance.\n*If Opponent moves UP to (1, 5):* I'm at (0, 2). Good distance. They eat an apple.\n\nI am choosing UP. It feels like the safest and most efficient path to early growth. We gotta assert dominance! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:**\nFocus on controlling the left side of the board (x=0, x=1) for early growth using the apples up there. Once we have a few segments, we shift focus to cutting off the opponent and forcing them into a corner. We need to be longer than them before we get aggressive.\n\nUP",

Board is 10x10.\n\nFirst turn \u2014 gotta stay alive and set up dominance early. Let's check moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 that's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating means we grow to length 2 next turn. But is it safe? Enemy is at (0,1), far away. No body threats. On board. \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1,3) \u2014 empty, safe. \u2705\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0,4) \u2014 empty, safe. \u2705\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 empty, safe. \u2705\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about next turn safety and aggression.\n\nIf we eat apple now, we'll have a body segment behind us at (1,4) next turn. That limits our backwards move later but gives us length advantage \u2014 could force head-on collisions later if we're longer.\n\nEnemy likely moves toward nearest apple? Nearest apple to enemy is (0,5) or (1,5) or (2,1). They might go UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1) toward (2,1)? Hard to predict.\n\nBut if we go UP to (1,5) and eat apple, enemy might also be heading toward (0,5) or (1,5)? If they go RIGHT then UP they could hit (1,5) same turn? Let's check: from (0,1), to reach (1,5) in one turn? Impossible. So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nLong-term: We want to control center, cut off enemy movement, force them into walls or our body. Eating early helps us get longer faster \u2014 more dangerous to them.\n\nBut also, maybe we don't want to grow too fast before we can trap them? Nah, content is key \u2014 apples = points = win condition.\n\nLet's think about future safe moves after each option:\n\n- **UP** to (1,5): Next turn, body at (1,4). From (1,5) possible moves: LEFT (0,5) apple, RIGHT (2,5) empty, DOWN (1,4) into own body (no), UP (1,6) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn. Good.\n\n- **DOWN** to (1,3): Next turn, still length 1. All 4 directions likely safe unless enemy moves into one. More flexibility but no growth.\n\n- **LEFT** to (0,4): Next turn, near left wall. Limits LEFT moves later.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,4): More central.\n\nI think UP is best \u2014 secure early apple, get longer, pressure enemy with size. We can start boxing them in toward bottom-left corner since they're at (0,1).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, try to move to cut off enemy's escape routes. If we see them moving up, we can shift left/right to block. Use our growing body as barrier.\n\nAlright chat, we're going for the early apple! Let's feast and flex! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Hype! \ud83d\udd25\n\nBut hold up, our opponent, Snake #0, already snagged an apple! What a try-hard! They are now at (1, 5) with a little tail starting at (1, 4). They are size 2, and we are still size 1. We gotta catch up, stat!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (0, 2)\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (1, 5). Opponent Body: (1, 4).\n*   **Score:** Me: 0, Them: 1. Unacceptable! \ud83d\ude21\n*   **Goal:** Move UP and secure that easy apple at (0, 5) on the left side, or at least position ourselves to get it next turn. We need growth and board presence!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No walls, no bodies.\n    *   **Strategic:** Keeps us on the left wall, moving directly toward the juicy Apple A at (0, 5), which is only two moves away. This is great for positioning and avoiding the central conflict zone where the enemy is.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us away from all close apples and pushes us back toward the corner. Not ideal for growth.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** Wall crash. NO THROWING! \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us toward the center. This is further away from the (0, 5) apple, but puts us slightly closer to the apple at (2, 1) or (3, 4). However, the enemy is currently in the x=1 column, and moving to (1, 2) or (1, 3) might bring us into their path quickly if they decide to move DOWN.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at (1, 5)):**\nThe opponent just ate the apple at (1, 5). They are surrounded by apples at (3, 5), (3, 4), and (7, 9).\n\n*   **Move 0 UP (1, 6):** Safe. Heading towards (7, 9) but a long route.\n*   **Move 0 RIGHT (2, 5):** Safe. Heading towards (3, 5) (Apple A). Very likely move!\n*   **Move 0 DOWN (1, 4):** **INSTA-DEATH!** Moving into their own body (the tail). They won't do this.\n*   **Move 0 LEFT (0, 5):** Safe. They eat the apple at (0, 5) this turn! This is a viable move since they get another point!\n\n**Collision Check (If me at (0, 2) moves UP to (0, 3)):**\nThe opponent is too far away for a head-on collision or a body crash. Even if they target (0, 5), (0, 3) is safe.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nWe need to grow right now. The apple at (0, 5) is the easiest, closest, and safest opportunity.\n\n*   If I move **UP to (0, 3)**, I'm setting myself up for the apple next turn at (0, 4) or the turn after at (0, 5).\n*   If the **Opponent moves LEFT to (0, 5)**, they eat the apple! Bummer! But I'm still safe at (0, 3), and I can then pivot to the apples at (3, 5) or (3, 4) if the opponent moves away.\n\nMoving UP is the most direct path to growth and maintains our defensive position along the wall. We cannot let our rival dominate the score early! We must prioritize apples that are not likely to be contested. (0, 5) is perfect for us. Let's aim straight for it!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:**\nTarget (0, 5) to match the opponent's score. Once grown, start navigating RIGHT, staying one row lower than the opponent if possible, to put pressure on their tail and prevent them from freely utilizing the top half of the board.\n\nUP",

They might go UP toward it.\n\nIf they go UP to (0,3), we go LEFT to (0,5) \u2014 that's same turn movement, heads could collide? Wait, simultaneous moves:  \n- If we go LEFT to (0,5) and they go UP twice? No, only one turn. They can't reach (0,5) from (0,2) in one move. So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \nBut they could go RIGHT to (1,2) \u2014 not near us.\n\nWhat about future safety after each of our safe moves:\n\n**UP to (1,6)**: Next turn body at (1,5),(1,4). From (1,6) moves: LEFT (0,6) empty, RIGHT (2,6) empty, UP (1,7) empty, DOWN (1,5) body \u274c. So 3 safe moves next turn. Puts us farther from enemy but also away from immediate boxing opportunity.\n\n**LEFT to (0,5)**: Eat apple, grow to length 3 next turn. Body becomes (0,5),(1,5),(1,4). From (0,5) next turn moves: UP (0,6) empty, DOWN (0,4) empty, LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT (1,5) body \u274c. So only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 and we're against left wall. Risky if enemy approaches.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,5)**: Body at (2,5),(1,5),(1,4) next turn? Wait, if we move RIGHT, tail stays at (1,4), body becomes head (2,5), then (1,5). From (2,5) next turn moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5) body \u274c, RIGHT (3,5) apple? Actually (3,5) is apple but moving into apple is safe (eats and grows). So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). More central, keeps options open.\n\nWe want to be aggressive \u2014 trap enemy in bottom-left. If we go LEFT and eat apple, we're longer but pinned to left wall. Enemy might move UP toward (0,3) or (0,4). If we're at (0,5), we could go DOWN next turn to (0,4) to block them \u2014 but if they go UP to (0,3), we'd miss. Hmm.\n\nBetter plan: Let's not get pinned early. Go RIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 central, more space to maneuver, and we can swing down toward enemy next turn to cut off escape. Enemy might move UP toward apples near top left, but we can intercept.\n\nAlso, if we go RIGHT, we leave apple at (0,5) \u2014 enemy might go for it, but they'd have to move UP twice to get there, giving us time to react.\n\nChat, I think we play it safe but controlling: RIGHT to (2,5). Stay flexible, keep enemy in sight, plan to cut off their movement next turn.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** Enemy likely moves UP or RIGHT. If they go UP to (0,3), we can move DOWN/LEFT to block. If they go RIGHT to (1,2), we can move DOWN toward (2,4) to pressure. Keep our body as barrier, aim to force them into wall or us.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! What an intense start! We're at Turn 2, and the opponent, Snake #0, is already flexing with an apple! Unsportsmanlike conduct, if you ask me!\n\nRookies, let's analyze the board!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 1):** Head at (0, 3). We moved up the wall last turn, exactly as planned! We are 0 apples deep. Shameful!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at (2, 5). Body at (1, 5). They must have moved RIGHT from (1, 5) to (2, 5) and eaten the apple at (2, 5)\u2014Wait, there was no apple at (2, 5) on the previous turn! Let's re-examine that opponent move.\n\n*Correction:*\nPrevious Turn (Turn 1):\nYour Head: (0, 2). Opponent Head: (1, 5). Opponent Body: (1, 4).\nApples: (3, 5), (3, 4), (7, 9), (6, 3), (7, 6), (8, 4), (9, 2), (2, 9), (0, 5), (7, 3), (4, 9), (5, 1), (3, 8), (2, 1), (0, 9).\n\nThe move log reveals: Snake #0 is now at Head: (2, 5), Body: [(1, 5)], Apples: 1.\nThis means Snake #0 moved RIGHT from (1, 5) to (2, 5). They did NOT eat an apple this move, which means the apple they ate was at the previous head position (1, 5) BEFORE I wrote the previous rationale.\n\nLet's assume the opponent's previous move was: RIGHT (1, 5 -> 2, 5).\nIf the body is now at (1, 5), they must have shrunk back to size 1 (if they didn't eat), or grown to size 2 (if they did eat). Since their apple count is 1, and the body is [(1, 5)], this means they are size 2. They must have eaten the apple at (1, 5) *before* Turn 1 started, and successfully moved RIGHT to (2, 5) without eating.\n\n*Phew. Technical difficulties aside, we know this:*\n*   **Me (ID 1):** (0, 3). Size 1. Going for that (0, 5) apple.\n*   **Them (ID 0):** (2, 5). Size 2. Their tail is at (1, 5).\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  **Safety First:** Ensure the move is safe.\n2.  **GROWTH:** We need to catch up on apples! (0, 5) is still the prime target.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Puts us one step closer to the apple at (0, 5). Excellent move for securing growth.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves away from all apples. Bad idea.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** Wall crash. NO THROWING!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us away from the easy apple (0, 5). It slightly enters the opponent's potential movement path, as they are nearby at (2, 5). Not the best strategic move right now.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at (2, 5), Tail at (1, 5)):**\nThe opponent is near four accessible apples: (3, 5), (3, 4), (0, 5), and (3, 8).\n\n*   **Move 0 RIGHT (3, 5):** **They eat an apple!** This is a huge possibility. They grow to size 3.\n*   **Move 0 UP (2, 6):** Safe. Heading toward (3, 8) or (2, 9). Slower path.\n*   **Move 0 LEFT (1, 5):** **INSTA-DEATH!** They crash into their own body (tail). Highly unlikely.\n*   **Move 0 DOWN (2, 4):** Safe. Heading toward (3, 4).\n\nIf the opponent moves RIGHT to (3, 5) and eats, they put themselves in a perfect spot to control the middle-left of the board.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are moving to (0, 4). The opponent is around (2, 5). There is zero chance of collision this turn, regardless of their move. We are safe to prioritize growth.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe path to (0, 5) remains our priority. It's the safest apple on the board for us. We need to match their score and gain size quickly so we can start exerting pressure. Moving UP to (0, 4) sets up the apple grab next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\nGrab the (0, 5) apple. If the rival grabs (3, 5), we will have secured the left wall section. We can then decide whether to grab the (0, 9) apple or cross the board toward the next easy set of apples like (4, 9) or (3, 8). For now, stay on the wall and secure this point!\n\nUP",

Let's keep the pressure ON!\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (2,6) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 our own body segment! \u274c That's suicide, eliminate.  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 apple there! \u2705  \n\nSo LEFT is out. Good.\n\nNow, think about enemy movement \u2014 they're at (0,3). Possible moves for them: UP (0,4), DOWN (0,2), RIGHT (1,3), LEFT off board \u274c. They probably want apples \u2014 closest apples to them are (0,5), (2,1), (3,4), (3,5). (0,5) is two moves away vertically. They might go UP toward it.\n\nIf they go UP to (0,4), we go RIGHT to (3,5) \u2014 that's no collision risk.  \nIf they go RIGHT to (1,3), still no collision.\n\nBut wait \u2014 head-on collision risk? They can't reach our target cells in one move. So safe.\n\nNow, future safety after each of our safe moves:\n\n**UP to (2,6)**: Next turn body at (2,6),(2,5),(1,5). From (2,6) moves: UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) body \u274c, LEFT (1,6) empty, RIGHT (3,6) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn. Puts us farther from enemy but also away from immediate pressure.\n\n**DOWN to (2,4)**: Next turn body at (2,4),(2,5),(1,5). From (2,4) moves: UP (2,5) body \u274c, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) apple \u2705. So 3 safe moves next turn. Puts us closer to bottom-left where enemy is \u2014 could start boxing them in.\n\n**RIGHT to (3,5)**: Eat apple, grow to length 3 next turn. Body becomes (3,5),(2,5),(1,5). From (3,5) next turn moves: UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) apple? Actually (3,4) is apple but moving into apple is safe (eats and grows), LEFT (2,5) body \u274c, RIGHT (4,5) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn. We get longer, more score lead, but central.\n\nWe want to be aggressive \u2014 trap enemy in bottom-left. If we go DOWN to (2,4), we're closer to cutting off their escape routes. Enemy might move UP toward (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3). If we're at (2,4), next turn we could go LEFT to (1,4) to block their potential RIGHT path, or DOWN to (2,3) to pressure.\n\nBetter plan: Let's not let them breathe! Go DOWN to (2,4) \u2014 it doesn't eat the apple at (3,5) yet, but it positions us to dominate the center-bottom. We keep the apple as bait maybe. Enemy might go for (0,5) apple, but that's fine \u2014 we can cut them off from other apples.\n\nAlso, if we go RIGHT and eat apple, we grow but our body blocks LEFT move next turn, pinning us a bit. DOWN keeps more options open while advancing toward enemy.\n\nChat, I think we play aggressive positioning: DOWN to (2,4). Next turn, we can move to (2,3) or (1,4) to squeeze enemy against the wall.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** Enemy likely moves UP or RIGHT. If they go UP to (0,4), we can move LEFT to (1,4) to block their rightward escape. If they go RIGHT to (1,3), we can move DOWN to (2,3) to pressure. Keep our body as barrier, aim to force them into wall or us.\n\nDOWN",

We are still size 1, but we are climbing the ladder, baby!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 1):** Head at (0, 4). Apple count: 0. We successfully moved to (0, 4) last turn. We are one move away from the highly contested (0, 5) apple!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at (2, 4). Body at [(2, 5)]. Apple count: 1. Wait a minute! The opponent moved DOWN from (2, 5) to (2, 4). They did *not* eat an apple, so their tail (2, 5) moved to (2, 4) and the previously defined body segment (1, 5) became the head (2, 5) and the tail (2, 5) disappeared? NO!\n\nLet's retrace the opponent's moves properly, based on the current body list:\nTurn 2 Head: (2, 5). Body: [(1, 5)].\nTurn 3 Head: (2, 4). Body: [(2, 5)].\n\nThis means Snake #0 moved **DOWN** from (2, 5) to (2, 4).\nSince they didn't eat (apple count is still 1), their tail (1, 5) advanced to (2, 5).\n*   Old Head (2, 5) -> New Head (2, 4)\n*   Old Body (1, 5) -> New Body (2, 5)\n*   Old Tail (1, 5) is GONE.\nCorrect. Snake #0 size is 2, and they are now focused on the bottom half of the map, possibly aiming for (3, 4) or even crossing toward us!\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  **Safety First:** Don't crash out!\n2.  **GROWTH:** We MUST secure the (0, 5) apple this turn to match scores and gain size!\n3.  **Pressure:** After eating, we will be in a position to pressure Snake #0.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** We move onto the apple at (0, 5). Safe from walls/bodies.\n    *   **Strategic:** Critical! We eat the apple, grow to size 2, and match the opponent's score! We secure the left wall segment. **This is the priority move.**\n2.  **DOWN (0, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moving away from growth. This is a retreat. Do we look like retreaters, Chat? NO!\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** Wall crash.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us onto the open board, but away from the apple. It puts us adjacent to the opponent's head at (2, 4). If the opponent moves LEFT (1, 4), we have a head-on collision! This is risky, especially when an apple is available.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at (2, 4), Body at (2, 5)):**\nThe opponent has just moved down. They are threatening the apples (3, 4) and (2, 1). Their body is blocking (2, 5).\n\n*   **Move 0 RIGHT (3, 4):** **They eat an apple!** Highest likelihood move, as it immediately provides growth and keeps them centered. If they move RIGHT, no collision with us.\n*   **Move 0 UP (2, 5):** **INSTA-DEATH!** They crash into their own body (tail). Highly unlikely.\n*   **Move 0 LEFT (1, 4):** Safe. This would set up a potential confrontation with us if we moved RIGHT (1, 4). But we are not moving RIGHT.\n*   **Move 0 DOWN (2, 3):** Safe. Heading deeper into the bottom center.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   If we move **UP (0, 5)**: We are nowhere near the opponent's movement paths (1, 4), (3, 4), or (2, 3). No collision possible.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThis is the easiest decision of the stream so far! We commit to the apple at (0, 5) and gain parity in size and score. This immediately sets us up for an aggressive push down the wall (targeting (0, 9)) or a sudden shift toward the board center to meet the opponent.\n\nWe need R-E-S-P-E-C-T, and a size 2 snake gets more respect than a size 1 snake! Go for the content!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Snake ID 1 is now size 2 at (0, 5), Body at (0, 4)):**\nSince Snake #0 is focused on the bottom middle (likely toward (3, 4)), we should continue securing the remaining vertical assets. Our next target should be the (0, 9) apple. We march up the left wall! We will force Snake #0 to chase us or concede the length advantage.\n\nUP",

Gotta keep the pressure ON! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, check immediate death moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (2,5) \u2014 that's our own body segment! \u274c SUICIDE, eliminate.  \n**DOWN** \u2192 (2,3) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n**LEFT** \u2192 (1,4) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n**RIGHT** \u2192 (3,4) \u2014 apple there! \u2705  \n\nSo UP is out. Good.\n\nNow, enemy is at (0,4). Their possible moves: UP (0,5) apple, DOWN (0,3) empty, RIGHT (1,4) empty, LEFT off board \u274c. They might go for the apple at (0,5) or move RIGHT toward center.\n\nHead-on collision risk? If we go LEFT to (1,4) and they go RIGHT to (1,4) \u2014 DOUBLE KO! That's dangerous if they choose RIGHT. If we go RIGHT to (3,4), they can't reach us. If we go DOWN to (2,3), they can't reach us either.\n\nWe have a length advantage (2 vs 1). In a head-on collision, if we both die, the higher score wins \u2014 that's us! So if we think they'll go RIGHT, maybe we WANT that collision? But careful \u2014 if we both die, game ends immediately and we win because we have more apples. That's a valid aggressive play! But only if we're sure they'll go RIGHT. Not guaranteed \u2014 they might go UP for the apple.\n\nLet's think about future safety and positioning:\n\n**RIGHT to (3,4)**: Eat apple, grow to length 3. Body becomes (3,4),(2,4),(2,5). Next turn from (3,4): UP (3,5) apple, DOWN (3,3) empty, LEFT (2,4) body \u274c, RIGHT (4,4) empty. So 3 safe moves. Gets us bigger, but central. Might let enemy breathe.\n\n**DOWN to (2,3)**: Body becomes (2,3),(2,4),(2,5). Next turn from (2,3): UP (2,4) body \u274c, DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) empty, RIGHT (3,3) empty. So 3 safe moves. Puts us lower, closer to bottom-left to squeeze enemy.\n\n**LEFT to (1,4)**: Body becomes (1,4),(2,4),(2,5). Next turn from (1,4): UP (1,5) empty, DOWN (1,3) empty, LEFT (0,4) enemy head? Wait, enemy currently at (0,4) but will move this turn. If they move away, (0,4) empty next turn. If they stay? Unlikely. RIGHT (2,4) body \u274c. So likely 3 safe moves next turn. But this move risks head-on collision THIS turn if enemy goes RIGHT.\n\nWe want to box enemy in bottom-left corner. If we go LEFT, we block their rightward escape more directly \u2014 but risk collision. If we go DOWN, we stay safe and can move LEFT next turn to block. If we go RIGHT, we grow but give them space.\n\nAggressive play: Force the head-on if they go RIGHT, since we win on score. But they might not. Let's check enemy incentives \u2014 closest apples to them: (0,5) UP, (3,4) RIGHT two away, (2,1) DOWN three away. They'll likely go UP for the apple. So collision unlikely.\n\nSo LEFT is probably safe. But why risk it? Let's go DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 then next turn we can go LEFT to (1,3) to cut off their downward escape, or RIGHT to (3,3) to stay central.\n\nActually, thinking bigger: We want to trap them against the left wall. If we go DOWN now, then LEFT next turn to (1,3), we're below them if they're at (0,5) or (0,3). That's good pressure.\n\nChat, I'm leaning DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 safe, keeps options open, continues squeezing them into the corner! We maintain score lead and positioning advantage. Let's execute! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** Enemy likely moved UP to (0,5) to eat apple. If so, they'll be length 2, head at (0,5), body at (0,4). We'll be at (2,3). Next move consider LEFT to (1,3) to block their rightward path, or DOWN to (2,2) to control bottom. Keep forcing them against the left wall!\n\nDOWN",

Body at [(0, 4)]. Apple count: 1. We are secured on the left wall.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at (2, 3). Body at [(2, 4)]. Apple count: 1. Wait a minute! The opponent was at (2, 4) last turn and they moved DOWN one square to (2, 3). They did *not* eat the (3, 4) apple? Interesting... they seem to be focused on the bottom layer or maybe going for (2, 1). This is good news for us!\n\n**Board Vibe Check:**\nWe are in a race for board control and length. We control the left flank. The opponent is bottom-center. The immediate danger of them turning RIGHT and eating the (3, 4) apple is still there, but they are clearly prioritizing downward momentum right now.\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  **Safety First:** Don't throw!\n2.  **GROWTH:** We must continue to grow and secure high-value apples while the opponent messes around in the basement! The next immediate apple for us is (0, 9), but that's four moves away. (2, 5) or (3, 5) are closer, but require breaking from the wall.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Continuing the march up the wall! This secures vertical space and puts us closer to the (0, 9) apple. Excellent option for dominating the far side.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **FATAL!** We move into our own body (tail). CRASH! Unacceptable.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** Wall crash.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** This moves us off the wall and toward the center. It opens the door to (2, 5) (clear) or (3, 5) (apple). It also makes us slightly more vulnerable to the opponent if they decide to suddenly turn and book it up the center. (2, 5) is open, but (3, 5) is an apple right now.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at (2, 3), Body at (2, 4)):**\nThe opponent has (3, 4) and (2, 1) available. They moved DOWN last turn, away from (3, 4).\n\n*   **Move 0 RIGHT (3, 3):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 3) or (6, 3) later.\n*   **Move 0 LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Moving laterally.\n*   **Move 0 UP (2, 4):** **FATAL!** They crash into their own body (tail). Highly unlikely.\n*   **Move 0 DOWN (2, 2):** Safe. Pushing toward (2, 1)?\n\nThe opponent is currently nowhere near us. We have zero collision risk on this turn.\n\n**The Strategy Conundrum (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Option UP (0, 6):** Secures the left edge. High ground is always good. Guaranteed path to the (0, 9) apple. This is the safe, long-term dominant move.\n*   **Option RIGHT (1, 5):** Puts pressure on the middle of the board and sets up an immediate threat to the (3, 5) apple in two turns. It also gives us proximity to the opponent if they suddenly realize the lower board is a dead end.\n\nSince the opponent is currently focused DOWN, we should use this opportunity to maximize our guaranteed board control and length. If we march UP, we will force the opponent to react to our length and positioning later. We secure this quadrant first. We can shift RIGHT later from a stronger position (like (0, 8) or (0, 9)).\n\nLet's maintain the wall control and guarantee future growth! We are not going to leave the wall open for them to sneak up on our flank. Plus, marching up to (0, 9) is 4 safe moves. We NEED to gain length parity rapidly!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Move UP to the ceiling, eat (0, 9). Then try to move RIGHT across the top to secure the (9, 9) side, or swing back down the center to challenge the opponent with a huge length advantage.\n\nUP",

This confirms they are NOT interested in the (3, 4) apple. They seem determined to stick to the bottom left area. Maybe they are going for the (2, 1) apple, or looping around the bottom? Interesting!\n\n**Board Vibe Check:**\nThe opponent is moving laterally at the bottom. We are moving vertically up the side. We have zero threat of collision immediately, but we need to pay attention if they decide to suddenly rocket upwards.\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  **Safety:** Don't crash into the wall or our own body!\n2.  **Length:** Continue prioritizing length.

This is the most efficient use of space to gain length and high ground. Puts us in position to snatch (0, 9) soon.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **FATAL!** We move into our own body (tail, which is now at (0, 5)). CRASH!

This is tempting because it opens up the path to the (2, 5) apple or (3, 5) apple. However, moving RIGHT gives up our advantage on the wall, and the opponent is nowhere near challenging the center yet.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at (1, 3), Body at (2, 3)):**\nThe opponent has just moved LEFT. They are positioned nicely to go DOWN to (1, 2), LEFT to (0, 3), or UP to (1, 4). They are clearly looking to dominate the bottom quadrant.\n\n*   If they go UP (1, 4), they are heading toward the center, but they are still far below us.\n*   If they go LEFT (0, 3), they are challenging our left wall lower down.\n\n**The Strategy Conundrum (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\nWe decided last turn to prioritize the wall for guaranteed length. We are only 3 moves from the apple at (0, 9). Sticking to the plan is crucial right now. Moving UP three times puts us at size 5, dominating the entire left flank. Moving RIGHT now risks getting intertwined with the opponent before we have enough length to use as a weapon.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum and continue our high-ground campaign. We want to be long and imposing when we eventually swing into the center!\n\n**Our Long-Term Plan (Reinforced):** Stick to the left wall. Secure (0, 9). Then, push RIGHT across the top edge.

We are dominating the high ground, and the opponent is still shuffling around in the basement! This is exactly where we want to be! We're building the wall!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 2):** Head at (0, 7). Body at [(0, 6)]. Apple count: 1. Moving strong up the left side.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at (1, 4). Body: [(1, 3)]. Apple count: 1. They just moved UP from (1, 3) to (1, 4)! They are finally realizing they need to gain some vertical ground.\n\n**Goal Check:** Box him in and make him crash out! But first, we need significant length.\n\n**Immediate Danger Assessment:**\nThe opponent is at (1, 4). We are at (0, 7). No immediate threat of collision. We are safe to continue our plan.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. The cell (0, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic:** Continues the strategic vertical climb! This moves us one step closer to the glorious (0, 9) apple. This is the optimal long-term move for securing length and board control.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **FATALITY!** We move into our own body (tail, which is now at (0, 6)). We don't throw, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** **WALL CRASH!** Insta-death! No way!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us toward the center. This is tempting because (2, 5) and (3, 5) apples are available, but moving right now concedes the high-ground, left-flank advantage we've been building. If we move right, the next turn we are forced to decide between getting entangled or turning back UP/LEFT, losing momentum.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 4), Body at (1, 3)):**\nThe opponent moved up to (1, 4). This confirms they are looking to gain elevation. Their safe options are UP (1, 5), LEFT (0, 4), or RIGHT (2, 4).\n\n*   If they move UP to (1, 5), they are moving toward the center apples.\n*   If they move LEFT to (0, 4), they are coming toward our tail, but we will be far out of reach by then.\n\n**The Master Plan (Recap):**\n1.  Secure the left wall.\n2.  Grab the (0, 9) apple.\n3.  Establish dominance along the top edge, moving right.\n4.  Once we are size 6+, use our length to corner the weakling!\n\nWe are two moves away from the apple at (0, 9)! Staying UP is the highest probability, lowest risk move that advances our core objective. We continue the vertical march! This is high-ground advantage, Chat! We are the King of the Mountain!\n\nWe're going UP!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self):** Secure (0, 9) next turn or the turn after. Then pivot RIGHT to start covering the top edge. Prioritize length and control. Keep track of Opponent's size; we want to ensure we are always equal or greater when we engage.\n\nUP",

Look at this map control!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 7):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 2):** Head at **(0, 8)**. Body at [(0, 7)] (which will be the new tail). Apple count: 1. We just moved UP! We are about to smell the sweet victory of that (0, 9) apple!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(1, 5)**. Body: [(1, 4)]. Apple count: 1. The opponent has also moved UP, trying to follow our lead, but they are stuck in the crowded lanes! Good luck down there, scrub!\n\n**Goal Check:** Secure the (0, 9) apple for length, then start pressing the advantage across the top edge. Box him in!\n\n**Immediate Danger Assessment:**\n*   We are at (0, 8). Opponent is at (1, 5). We are perfectly safe from them this turn.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (0, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (0, 9) is an apple!\n    *   **Strategic:** **EPIC MOVE!** This secures the apple (0, 9), making us size 3 (our body will be [(0, 8), (0, 7)]), and gives us perfect control of the top-left corner. This is exactly what we planned! Length is everything!\n2.  **DOWN (0, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. We move onto our previous body segment, which is now the tail and will be vacated.\n    *   **Strategic:** A retreat!? Are you crazy, Chat? We are inches from content! We don't go backward when the goal is right there! Massive loss of tempo. NO!\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** **WALL CRASH!** No way! We don't throw the game in Turn 7!\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves us away from the immediate apple and into open territory. While this sets us up for the top-edge sweep, grabbing the length *first* is paramount. Moving up to (0, 9) allows us to move RIGHT to (1, 9) next turn, achieving the same coverage but with more immediate advantage.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 5), Body at (1, 4)):**\nThe opponent is looking for an apple or high ground.\n\n*   They might move **UP (1, 6)** to continue the high-ground push.\n*   They might move **RIGHT (2, 5)** to grab the (2, 5) apple.\n*   They might move **LEFT (0, 5)** to hug the wall.\n\nWherever they go, they are too far away for an immediate collision threat. Our strategy is purely growth and board expansion right now.\n\n**The Master Plan Execution:**\nWe go UP for the apple! This is non-negotiable! We gain length, we gain score, and we firmly establish control of the top edge. Once we land at (0, 9), the next move *must* be RIGHT to (1, 9) or (1, 8) to start sweeping across! Size advantage will be secured!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self):** After collecting the (0, 9) apple, pivot to the right (likely (1, 9)) to sweep the top edge and secure the (2, 9) and (4, 9) apples. Maintain the horizontal barrier to cut off the opponent's access to the high zone. If the enemy lunges too far high, be prepared to cut them off aggressively if we have length superiority.\n\nUP",

We have the advantage, and now we press it! WE ARE LIVE!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 8)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 3):** Head at **(0, 9)**. Body at [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. Apple count: 2.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(1, 6)**. Body: [(1, 5)]. Apple count: 1. They moved UP last turn. They are now vertically aligned with our body, keeping an eye on our flank! Sneaky!\n\n### Goal Check\n\nWe have secured the high ground and length advantage. Our new goal: sweep the top edge (9th row) to grab more real estate and the (2, 9) and (4, 9) apples, while simultaneously setting up a barrier to cut off Snake #0's escape routes. We are boxing him in!\n\n### Safety & Collision Assessment from (0, 9)\n\nWe need to check all four directions for safety:\n\n1.  **UP (0, 10):** **WALL CRASH!** We don't jump off the map, Chat! ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Moves us onto our own body segment. Typically deadly, *unless* that segment is the tail. The tail is (0, 7). (0, 8) is a body segment. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** ELIMINATED.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 9):** **WALL CRASH!** No, sir! ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 9) is empty. Safe from self-crash and wall crash.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (1, 6). The furthest they can reach is (1, 7), (2, 6), (0, 6), or (1, 5) if they move down. We are completely safe from a head-on collision at (1, 9). **SAFE!**\n\n### Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (Only RIGHT remains!)\n\n*   **RIGHT (1, 9):** This is the only safe move.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Perfect move! It continues our top-edge sweep. It establishes length along the highest available row, creating a huge potential barrier for the opponent if they try a vertical push. It also puts us in perfect position to grab the (2, 9) apple next turn, or at least keep moving right. We're locking down the top half of the map!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 6), Body at (1, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is currently right next to the wall on the 1st column. They have several options:\n\n1.  **LEFT (0, 6):** Blocks our body! But since they are size 2, their tail is (1, 5). Moving to (0, 6) is safe. This keeps them on the vertical axis, potentially trying to get past our body.\n2.  **UP (1, 7):** Continues the climb. This is smart, as it gets them closer to the high-value apples up here.\n3.  **RIGHT (2, 6):** Moves them towards the (6, 6) apple and off the crowded left edge.\n4.  **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe, as it moves them onto their tail. A retreat, but opens up (1, 6) for their tail to exit if needed.\n\nRegardless of their move, we are moving to (1, 9). They cannot reach us. Our primary objective is maximizing board control right now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe move is clear. We are extending our length and range across the top of the map. No hesitation, no fear! We are dominating!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self):** Consolidate the top row. Move RIGHT to (1, 9), then look for (2, 9) or (3, 9). If the opponent starts climbing, maintain the horizontal line to cut off his access to the highest apples (4, 9). Use the board's edge to our advantage to prevent them from slipping behind us.\n\nRIGHT",

We're running away with it!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 9)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 3):** Head at **(1, 9)**. Body at [(0, 9), (0, 8)]. We are sweeping the top row!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(1, 7)**. Body: [(1, 6)]. They moved UP last turn. They are attempting to climb the wall to counteract our sweep! Smart... but too late!\n\n### Goal Check\n\nWe need to continue our sweep along the top row to lock down the (2, 9) and (4, 9) apples, building a powerful barrier across the board. We are looking to create a \"C\" shape that corners Snake #0 into a small vertical section of the map. They are currently confined to columns 0, 1, and 2 if we move fast enough!\n\n### Safety & Collision Assessment from (1, 9)\n\nWe need to check all four directions for safety:\n\n1.  **UP (1, 10):** **WALL CRASH!** No self-destructing, Chat! ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 8) is empty. Safe from self-crash.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** The opponent's head is at (1, 7). If we move to (1, 8) and they move UP to (1, 8), that's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Oof! They die, we die. Since we have a score advantage and better board position, is this worth the risk? Let's check their other moves first. **HIGH RISK - PENDING ELIMINATION.**\n3.  **LEFT (0, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Moves us onto our own body segment. Typically deadly, *unless* that segment is the tail. The segment at (0, 9) is the segment *right behind our head*. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 9) contains an Apple (A)! This is safe from self-crash and wall collisions.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (1, 7). They cannot possibly reach (2, 9) this turn. **SAFE!**\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 7), Body at (1, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is vertical on column 1. They are likely going to keep climbing to challenge our high-ground dominance.\n\n1.  **UP (1, 8):** This is the most dangerous move for us. It leads to a head-on collision at (1, 8) if we choose DOWN. Given their current position and our dominance on the top edge, climbing is their best way to contest. **VERY LIKELY.**\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 7):** Moving off the wall and toward the middle. This is a decent move to open up options towards the (7, 9) apple.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 7):** Moving toward their tail (1, 6). This is safe but gives up vertical territory to us!\n4.  **DOWN (1, 6):** Moves into their tail. A total retreat. Unlikely, but safe.\n\n### Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (Only RIGHT remains!)\n\n*   **Move DOWN (1, 8):** Collision risk with a likely opponent move (UP to (1, 8)). We don't need to risk a double KO when we have a clear safe route to an apple and continued board control. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 9):**\n    *   **Strategic Value:** YES! We eat the apple at (2, 9)! We grow to length 4, while the opponent remains at length 2 (size 3 to size 2 is a huge mental advantage, Chat!). This continues our horizontal boxing strategy perfectly. It solidifies our control over the entire 9th row, making it extremely difficult for the opponent to access the high-value apples further to the right (like (4, 9) and (7, 9)). We are building the wall! **PERFECT MOVE.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe path is clear. We take the apple, we expand our zone of control, and we force the opponent to react to us! We are turning the top edge into hostile territory for Snake #0. No risk, all reward!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** After moving to (2, 9), we will continue RIGHT to (3, 9) and then (4, 9) to secure that apple and finish sealing off the top section. If the opponent pushes significantly into the middle (x > 4), we can cut down. If they continue to climb Column 1/2, we'll have a massive head start on length. Build the wall, boys!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 10, LFG! Did we just dominate that last turn or what?! We are BIGGER, we are FASTER, and we are on the high ground! Our score is **3**, their score is **1**. We're running away with it! We just crushed it by eating the apple at (2, 9) and now we are length 4!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 10)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 4):** Head at **(2, 9)**. Body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]. We are sweeping the top row and building a massive wall!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(2, 7)**. Body: [(1, 7)]. Wait, what did they do last turn? They moved **RIGHT** from (1, 7) to (2, 7)! They seem to be trying to outflank us by moving into the board's interior, but they are still way behind. They moved off the wall, and now they are right below us! This is prime trapping territory!\n\n### Goal Check: BOX THEM IN!\n\nOur primary goal remains the same: use our superior length (4 to 2!) and high-ground position to dominate the board, especially the top half. We need to continue moving RIGHT to seal off the top-right corner and force Snake #0 to fight for the scraps below. If Snake #0 stays at (2, 7), they are perfectly positioned to be crushed.\n\n### Safety & Collision Assessment from (2, 9)\n\nWe need to check all four directions for safety:\n\n1.  **UP (2, 10):** **WALL CRASH!** No way, we're better than that! ELIMINATED.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 8) is empty. Safe from self-crash.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** The opponent's head is at (2, 7). If we move DOWN to (2, 8) and they move UP to (2, 8), it's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Since we have a massive length advantage (4 vs 2), if the Board Rules allow us to survive a head-to-head collision with a shorter snake - this is an instant win! *However*, the rules state: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" We cannot risk a double KO when we are dominating. We must eliminate this risk. **DANGEROUS COLLISION RISK!** ELIMINATED (unless it's our last safe option).\n3.  **LEFT (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Moves us onto our own body segment. The segment at (1, 9) is the segment *right behind our head*. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** We do not retreat into the wall we just built! ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 9) is empty. Safe from self-crash.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (2, 7). They cannot possibly reach (3, 9) this turn. **SAFE!**\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 7), Body at (1, 7))\n\nSnake #0 just moved right and is now vertical on columns 1 and 2, y=7 segment. They have a few options:\n\n1.  **UP (2, 8):** This is the move that *threatens* us. If they try to get beneath us and move up to challenge our dominance on the top edge. The apple at (3, 8) is close, but (2, 8) is empty. **VERY LIKELY** they try to move up and contest the area next to us.\n2.  **RIGHT (3, 7):** Moving toward open space and an apple at (7, 9) down the line. A solid, safe, non-confrontational move.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 7):** Moving into their own tail. Safe but highly inefficient. Low probability.\n4.  **DOWN (2, 6):** Moving away from us, toward the middle. Safe, but gives up the vertical challenge.\n\n### Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (Only RIGHT remains!)\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (3, 9):**\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This is the perfect continuation of our boxing strategy. By securing (3, 9), we continue to build our wall along the top and push towards the juicy apple at (4, 9). This isolates the enemy further into the 10x8 area below us. It's safe, aggressive, and maximizes our board control. We are forcing them to scramble for space while we safely grow and build resources.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMove RIGHT is the only safe move that",

We are length **4** to their length **2**. We are dominating the top half of a 10x10 board!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 11)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 4):** Head at **(3, 9)**. Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. We just ate an apple at (2, 9) and grew! We are now a massive wall across the top!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(3, 7)**. Body: [(2, 7)]. Wait, what did they do? They moved **RIGHT** from (2, 7) to (3, 7)! Look at them, trying to scurry away from our massive shadow! They were probably scared of the head-to-head collision risk at (2, 8) we analyzed last turn. Now they're isolated on the board, two steps below our head.\n\n### Goal Check: EXECUTE THE BOX!\n\nWe need to close the gap and start forcing them into corners. Since they moved right, they are currently in column 3. We are in a perfect position to move DOWN and cut off their retreat back to the left, or keep moving RIGHT to build a massive ceiling and force them into the lower half of the board.\n\nLet's look at the immediate environment around our head at (3, 9):\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (3, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 10):** **WALL CRASH!** No explanation needed. ELIMINATED.\n2.  **LEFT (2, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** The segment at (2, 9) is the segment *right behind our head*. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** We do not retreat! ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (4, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 9) has an **APPLE!** Massive play! If we move here, we grow to 5 segments.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Head at (3, 7). They cannot reach (4, 9). SAFE!\n4.  **DOWN (3, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 8) has an **APPLE!** Also a massive play! If we move here, we grow to 5 segments.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Head at (3, 7). If we move DOWN to (3, 8) and they move UP to (3, 8), it's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Since we have *double their length* (4 vs 2), this is the optimal moment for a high-score forced collision *if we were 100% sure we survive*. Since the rule is \"BOTH snakes die,\" we **CANNOT RISK A DRAW** when we are ahead 3 to 1. This is a high-risk head-on match-up. **DANGEROUS COLLISION RISK!** ELIMINATED, unless we want to risk a double K.O., which we do not.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 7), Body at (2, 7))\n\nThe opponent is cornered and scrambling. They have few good moves:\n\n1.  **UP (3, 8):** This is the apple! They absolutely see it. **HIGHLY LIKELY.** If they move here, they get the apple, and it creates the head-on collision with us if we move DOWN.\n2.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** Safe, open, continues their retreat from the top wall. This is their safe move.\n3.  **DOWN (3, 6):** Moves into an open, safe area. Also a safe retreat.\n4.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Moves into their own tail segment. Only if they are desperate. Unlikely.\n\n### Strategic Selection: We have to force the enemy's hand!\n\nWe have two apples we can reach, but only one is safe:\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** HIGH COLLISION RISK. Opponent is highly motivated to move UP to (3, 8) for the apple. We avoid this for now.\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** **PERFECT MOVE! SAFE APPLE EAT!**\n    *   It continues our wall across the top.\n    *   It is 100% safe from the opponent.\n    *   It gives us +1 length (Size 5! We become an absolute monster!) and +1 score (4 to 1!).\n    *   It still leaves us in a commanding position to later move DOWN into the interior, possibly trapping Snake #0 against the right wall.\n\nBy moving RIGHT, we are forcing the opponent to either move UP and get the apple at (3, 8) (which is a good move for them, but it keeps them small), or move away from us entirely. Either way, we grow faster and maintain board control.\n\nWe're going for the safe, aggressive growth move, Chat! Let's get this apple and grow even longer so we can box them in from above!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Adjustment:\nFocus on securing the top row. Once we hit the right boundary, we will turn DOWN and sweep the right column, forcing the opponent into the bottom-left quadrant. We must maintain our length advantage!\n\nRIGHT",

Our advantage is overwhelming, 4 apples to their 1, and we have over double their length (5 vs 2)!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 12)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 5):** Head at **(4, 9)**. Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. We are the ceiling!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2):** Head at **(4, 7)**. Body: [(3, 7)]. Wait, what did they do? Hah! They moved RIGHT from (3, 7) to (4, 7)! They were trying to get away from the looming threat of the apple at (3, 8) and our massive self! Cowards! They are completely isolated now.\n\n### Goal Check: EXECUTE THE BOX!\n\nWe have successfully established full control over the top row (Y=9). The next strategic step is to secure the upper-RIGHT quadrant of the board and start driving the opponent downwards and leftwards into a tight spot. Look at the real estate we own!\n\nLet's look at the immediate environment around our head at (4, 9):\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (4, 9))**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 10):** **WALL CRASH!** Still lethal. ELIMINATED.\n2.  **LEFT (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** The segment at (3, 9) is right behind our head. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** We do not retreat! ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (5, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 9) is currently empty. A safe move.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Head at (4, 7). They cannot possibly reach (5, 9). SAFE!\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Continues our wall-building to the right edge. Excellent board control move.\n4.  **DOWN (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 8) is currently empty. A safe move.\n    *   **Opponent Collision Risk:** Head at (4, 7). If we move DOWN to (4, 8) and they move UP to (4, 8)... **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Since we have the length advantage (5 vs 2), we WIN the collision! This is a massive play. They die, we live, we secure the win instantly!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 7), Body at (3, 7))\n\nThe opponent is now desperate. They are stuck in column 4, two squares below us. Their viable moves are:\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** This is highly likely! Why? Because they are scared of moving further down, and an aggressive UP move is their only chance to challenge us. If they move UP, they create the collision we want!\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** Safe, open territory. A passive move to escape our shadow.\n3.  **DOWN (4, 6):** Safe, open territory. A passive move to escape our shadow.\n4.  **LEFT (3, 7):** Moving into their own tail segment. Only if they are desperate. Unlikely.\n\n### Strategic Selection: We go for the knockout!\n\nChat, listen up! We have a guaranteed win condition if they move UP, and a guaranteed dominant position if they move any other way.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (4, 8)**\n*   If they move **UP to (4, 8)**: **WE WIN INSTANTLY!** Length 5 vs 2. They crash out!\n*   If they move **RIGHT or DOWN**: We secure column 4, and position our head perfectly to cut off their escape into the lower-right quadrant. This is a massive move for board domination.\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (5, 9)**\n*   Safe growth, but it delays the confrontation. It allows them to reposition freely in column 4 or 5 and might let them find an apple lower down, reducing our overwhelming lead.\n\nWe are long enough, and our position is perfect! Why wait? We need to use our length advantage *now* to force the kill! We are betting on their desperation and their tendency to move towards the center/pressure zones. They are currently facing UP, and moving UP to (4, 8) puts them on the offensive\u2014the only way they can try to get out from beneath us.\n\n**We are forcing the 5 vs 2 head-on confrontation.** This is the moment, chat! We're going for the glory kill! We move DOWN to (4, 8) and eliminate the threat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Adjustment:\nIf the opponent survives this move (i.e., they move RIGHT or DOWN), we will continue to move DOWN, sweeping column 4 to cut the board in half and force them to the left side or the very bottom. We must utilize our length to suffocate their movement.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! That clip review was FIRE! We executed the perfect power play! We moved DOWN to (4, 8) and look where we are now!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 5, 4 apples):** Head at **(4, 8)**. Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]. We successfully moved into the pressure point!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2, 1 apple):** Head at **(5, 7)**. Body: [(4, 7)]. HOLY MOLY! They dipped! They saw the threat at (4, 8) and instinctively moved RIGHT from (4, 7) to **(5, 7)**! Cowards! They avoided the collision, but now they are totally out of position and surrounded by our looming presence!\n\nLook at the scoreboard, chat! 4 apples to 1! Our length is still massive compared to theirs! Our strategy worked, even though it didn't result in the instant kill. It resulted in the enemy fleeing right into our trap setup!\n\n### The Box Tightens\n\nWe own the top wall (Y=9) and we now control column 4 (down to Y=8). The enemy is now compressed into the area around (5, 7). They have nowhere to go!\n\nLet's look at their immediate options from (5, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (5, 8):** Safe, open. This is their most obvious move to try and escape our lower cuts.\n2.  **RIGHT (6, 7):** Safe, open, leads them away from the board center.\n3.  **DOWN (5, 6):** Safe, open.\n4.  **LEFT (4, 7):** Moving into their own former head position (now their tail). This is the only way for them to get closer to the center, but it's dangerous, as we're right above (4, 8).\n\n### Our Next Move: Cut off the Escape!\n\nOur head is at (4, 8). Our primary goal is to box them entirely into the upper-right quadrant and then constrict the space until they crash. We need to prevent them from moving freely down columns 5 and 6.\n\n**Safety Check (From (4, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** Moving into our own body segment. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** ELIMINATED.\n2.  **LEFT (3, 8):** Safe. Apple at (3, 8)! Great move!\n3.  **RIGHT (5, 8):** Safe. **CRITICAL SQUARE!** If we move here and they move UP to (5, 8), it's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Since we are length 5 and they are length 2, **WE WIN and secure the kill!** This is the high-reward play.\n4.  **DOWN (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us deeper into the board, past where the opponent currently is.\n\n### Strategic Selection: We go for the kill AGAIN! (And block their best escape)\n\nThe opponent's most strategically viable survival move is to move UP to (5, 8). It gets them away from their tail at (4, 7) and establishes a new horizontal line of defense.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (5, 8)**:\n*   If they move **UP to (5, 8)**: **INSTANT WIN!** We leverage our 5 vs 2 length advantage. GET WRECKED!\n*   If they move **RIGHT to (6, 7)**: We secure (5, 8), cutting off their vertical path. We can then strike down column 5 next turn or move to (6, 8) to complete the lid.\n*   If they move **DOWN or LEFT**: They are in a worse position, and we now own the high ground above them, poised to strike.\n\nThis move to (5, 8) simultaneously threatens an immediate win *and* denies them critical expansion space. It's the most aggressive, highest payoff move.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3, 8)? Moving **LEFT** to (3, 8) for the apple is tempting, but it allows the opponent to freely move UP to (5, 8), or RIGHT to (6, 7), escaping our pressure entirely. Right now, board control and the kill are more important than 1 apple.\n\nWe press the advantage, Chat! We are kings of the mountain! We are forcing this issue!\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nIf the opponent survives this turn, we continue moving rightwards along Y=8, forcing them further and further into the top-right corner, or we drop down into column 5 and start constricting the space from underneath them. Full box setup is imminent!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! ARE YOU READY FOR THE CLUTCH? We just executed the sickest press play of the year! Let's look at the setup!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 14)\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 5, 4 apples):** Head at **(5, 8)**. Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. We successfully moved RIGHT into (5, 8)!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 2, 1 apple):** Head at **(6, 7)**. Body: [(5, 7)]. They chickened out! When they saw us move to (5, 8), they moved RIGHT from (5, 7) to **(6, 7)**! They avoided the guaranteed head-on collision, but at what cost, chat?!\n\nThey are now pinned! Their head is at (6, 7). Our body is a solid wall running from (2, 9) all the way to our head at (5, 8). We are dominating the top of the map.\n\nWe are 4 apples to 1! Length 5 to Length 2! The advantage is MASSIVE!\n\n### The Trap is Set\n\nThe enemy is currently at (6, 7). What are their safe moves?\n\n1.  **UP (6, 8):** Safe, open. This is their absolute best bet for survival, gaining precious space.\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe, open, but pushes them further into the corner.\n3.  **DOWN (6, 6):** Safe, open. Apple at (6, 6).\n4.  **LEFT (5, 7):** Moves into their own former head position (now their tail). Safe, but leads them directly under our head.\n\n### Our Options from (5, 8): Full Containment!\n\nOur head is at (5, 8). We must prevent them from escaping towards the center and ensure they cannot move laterally freely.\n\n**Safety Check (From (5, 8))**\n\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** Safe. Fills the gap on the wall.\n2.  **LEFT (4, 8):** Into our own body segment. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!** ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 8):** Safe. **CRITICAL SQUARE!** If we move here, and they move UP to (6, 8), it's a **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We win! This is the instant kill shot.\n4.  **DOWN (5, 7):** Safe. Moves us directly across from their tail.\n\n### Strategic Selection: The Guillotine Drop!\n\nWe have two incredibly strong moves: **RIGHT to (6, 8)** or **DOWN to (5, 7)**.\n\n**Option A: RIGHT to (6, 8)**\n*   If they move **UP to (6, 8)**: **INSTANT WIN!** We leverage the size advantage for the kill.\n*   If they move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: We secure (6, 8), completely capping the top of the board. They are utterly boxed in now, trapped below Y=8, between X=7 and X=9. Next turn, we can strike down or move to (7, 8).\n*   If they move **DOWN or LEFT**: They are in a worse position, and we now own the high ground above them, poised to strike.\n\nThis move is a direct, aggressive challenge, threatening the immediate POG kill.\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (5, 7)**\n*   This places our head right next to their tail at (5, 7).\n*   If they move **LEFT to (5, 7)**: **INSTANT WIN!** We leverage the size advantage.\n*   If they move UP to (6, 8): They escape the immediate threat, but now our head is deep into their territory, ready to drop into column 5 and start constricting the space below them. This takes longer.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT to (6, 8)** is the most pressing move. It serves multiple purposes:\n1.  It is the optimal aggressive move, as it cuts off the opponent's only good escape route (UP) and threatens an immediate size-advantage kill.\n2.  If they avoid the collision, it completes the perfect box setup (sealing the lid along Y=8), making their immediate death inevitable.\n\nWe press the advantage, chat! We are going for the win! We are sealing the coffin!\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nIf the opponent survives this turn (by moving RIGHT to (7, 7) or DOWN to (6, 6)), we continue our motion rightwards along Y=8, or drop down into column 6, 7, 8, etc., pushing them into X=9 and crushing them! They have nowhere to go!\n\nRIGHT",

CAN'T GAMBLE WHEN WE'RE BEHIND ON SCORE! \ud83c\udfb2\n\nDOWN TO (6,6) GETS US THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e WE GROW TO LENGTH 3! THAT'S CONTENT! BUT IS IT SAFE FROM FUTURE TRAPS? LET'S THINK!\n\nFROM (6,6) NEXT TURN, OUR HEAD MOVES, OUR BODY BECOMES [(6,7), (5,7)]. ENEMY WILL BE AT ONE OF: (5,9), (5,7), OR (6,8). IF HE'S AT (5,7), THAT'S RIGHT BELOW OUR NEW BODY AT (6,7)? HOLD UP, THAT'S DANGEROUS! HE COULD MOVE UP INTO US NEXT TURN? BUT WE'D BE MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY... WE NEED TO CHECK FUTURE OPTIONS.\n\nBETTER PLAY: GO RIGHT TO (7,7)? THAT'S SAFE, BUT WE DELAY THE APPLE. WE NEED TO GROW TO COMPETE! HE'S LENGTH 5, WE'RE LENGTH 2! WE NEED THAT APPLE NOW! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCHAT, LOOK AT THE BOARD! IF WE GO DOWN AND EAT, WE'RE AT (6,6). ENEMY AT (5,7) IS ADJACENT LEFT. NEXT TURN FROM (6,6), OUR SAFE MOVES? UP (6,7) OUR BODY \u274c, DOWN (6,5) EMPTY, LEFT (5,6) EMPTY, RIGHT (7,6) EMPTY. 3 SAFE MOVES! ENEMY AT (5,7) HAS: UP (5,8) EMPTY, DOWN (5,6) SAME AS OUR LEFT TARGET, LEFT (4,7) EMPTY, RIGHT (6,7) OUR BODY \u274c. POTENTIAL HEAD-ON AT (5,6) IF WE BOTH GO THERE? THAT'S A RISK FOR NEXT TURN, BUT WE CAN MANEUVER.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: EAT THE APPLE NOW TO CLOSE THE LENGTH GAP! THEN USE OUR NEW LENGTH TO START BOXING HIM IN! HE'S NEAR THE TOP WALL! WE CAN PUSH FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST!\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN: AFTER EATING, WE'RE AT (6,6). ENEMY LIKELY AT (5,7), (5,9), OR (6,8). IF HE'S AT (5,7), AVOID LEFT TO (5,6) IF HE MIGHT GO DOWN. PREFER DOWN OR RIGHT TO CREATE SPACE AND SET UP A TRAP! STAY AGGRESSIVE AND GROW! WE NEED LENGTH TO CHALLENGE HIM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "WHAT'S UP, CHAT! We have the enemy **PULVERIZED**! Look at the board! We went for the kill shot, and they *ran*! Cowards! But we are relentless!\n\n## Turn 15 Analysis: The Chokehold Tightens\n\n### Current State\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1 - Size 5, 4 apples):** Head at **(6, 8)**. Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)].\n    *   *Observation:* We successfully secured (6, 8), sealing the top corner!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0 - Size 3, 2 apples):** Head at **(6, 6)**. Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7)].\n    *   *Observation:* The enemy moved DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6)! They avoided the head-collision at (6, 8) and ate an apple! GGs to them for the small optimization, but it doesn't matter; they are still trapped! Length 5 vs Length 3. Our size advantage is still massive!\n\n### The Imminent Threat (The Box)\n\nOur head is at (6, 8). Their head is at (6, 6).\nThey are now boxed in by:\n1.  **Our body/head wall:** (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8).\n2.  **The right wall:** X=9.\n3.  **The center of the board.**\n\nThey have two immediate segments of their body directly above them: (6, 7) and (5, 7).\n\n### Opponent's Safe Moves from (6, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (6, 7):** Moves into their own body segment (now their tail end is at (6, 7) since they grew). **DEAD.** Wait, they just grew, so their tail is currently (5, 7). No, that's not right.\n    *   *Correction Check:* Head (6, 6), Body (6, 7), Tail (5, 7).\n    *   When a snake eats, the body and tail *do not move* until the next turn. So last turn, when they moved to (6, 6) AND ate the apple, their new tail segment appeared at (5, 7).\n    *   Therefore, their current body is [(6, 7), (5, 7)]. Their tail will leave (5, 7) this turn.\n    *   Moving UP to (6, 7) means crashing into their own body. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!**\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 6):** Safe. There is an apple here!\n3.  **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe.\n4.  **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe.\n\nConclusion: They are *extremely* limited. Their best move is likely to eat the apple at (7, 6) to keep growing, or move LEFT to (5, 6) to try and snake around our body.\n\n### Our Strategy from (6, 8): Pushing to the Wall\n\nOur goal is to continue the containment and force them into a self-crash or into the wall. We are seeking to gain position (7, 8) or (8, 8) to secure the space above them.\n\n**Our Safe Moves from (6, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe. Fills in the last corner gap. This is a very strong move for securing the high ground.\n2.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. Directly prepares to cut off their movement towards X=7 or X=8.\n3.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Moves into the opponent's body segment at (6, 7). **INSTANT WIN!** (They lose, we live). This is the kill shot!\n4.  **LEFT (5, 8):** Into our own body segment. **DEADLY SELF-CRASH!**\n\n**The Ultimate Strategy: The Drop Kill!**\n\nMoving **DOWN to (6, 7)** is an immediate game-winner, **unless** they move their head to (6, 7) simultaneously.\n\nIf they move their head to (6, 7), they are moving into their own body (which is currently the *full* body including the tail that gets deleted). Since they just ate, their current body segments are (6, 7) and (5, 7). If they move into (6, 7) on this turn, they are crashing into their *still existing* body segment. **They die by self-collision.**\n\nTherefore, they **cannot** move UP to (6, 7).\n\nIf they move **DOWN to (6, 7)**, we hit their existing body segment. **We win!** This is the highest probability instant win move.\n\nLet's confirm the simultaneous movement logic:\n*   We move to (6, 7).\n*   They move (let's say) to (7, 6) -> We hit their body at (6, 7). **WE WIN!**\n*   They move (let's say) to (5, 6) -> We hit their body at (6, 7). **WE WIN!**\n*   They move (let's say) to (6, 5) -> We hit their body at (6, 7). **WE WIN!**\n\nThis is the perfect moment! We are crashing into their body segment at (6, 7). They cannot defend this square by moving there themselves (self-crashes lose), and no matter where they go, that body segment is currently occupied by them.\n\n**WAIT!** Crucial rule check: \"Each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\nYour Snake Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (Head at (6, 8))\nOpponent Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7)] (Head at (6, 6))\n\nThe segment (6, 7) is part of their body. If we move to (6, 7), we gain the point, and they lose!\n\n### Let's Go for the Finish!\n\nThis is the move, chat! The guillotine drops! They are trapped, and we are going in for the body shot! This is the most aggressive, decisive, and game-winning move available!\n\nWe move DOWN to (6, 7)!\n\nDOWN",
