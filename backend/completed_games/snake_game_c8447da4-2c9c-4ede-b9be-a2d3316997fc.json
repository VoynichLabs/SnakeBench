Moving UP twice will place us on (5,7), then (5,8).\n\nHowever, note that the apple at (5,8) is coinciding with the enemy snake's head at (4,8). Wait, the enemy is at (4,8), and our target apple is at (5,8). The apple at (5,8) is safe because the enemy is at (4,8), so not blocking our path; moving upward won't collide with the enemy.\n\nBut the important detail is that the enemy snake's head is at (4,8), and our target apple is at (5,8). Since they're on adjacent cells, and the enemy is at (4,8), static for now, but possibly planning to move.\n\nSo, moving upward seems safe, as long as the enemy isn't planning to move into (5,8)\u2014but we lack info about their next move.\n\nGiven this, the safest and most direct approach is to move UP, pursuing the closest apple at (5,8).\n\nLet's check other options:\n\n- LEFT or RIGHT may take us away from the apple, increasing risk and lengthening the path.\n- DOWN is opposite, moving us away from the apple.\n\nGiven all this, moving UP is the best choice.\n\nNext move: UP."

I can see the \"T\" marker shows my tail position.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at (5, 7) with no body segments, so they're still length 1.\n\nAvailable apples: (3, 1), (4, 0), (1, 3), (4, 6), (2, 0)\n\nFrom position (4, 8), let me check my movement options:\n- UP: Move to (4, 9) - valid, moves toward top edge\n- DOWN: Move to (4, 7) - valid, moves toward apples\n- LEFT: Move to (3, 8) - valid\n- RIGHT: Move to (5, 8) - INVALID! This is where my body segment is\n\nThe enemy snake is now at (5, 7), which is diagonally down-right from me. They're getting closer to my general area.\n\nLooking at apple positions, I notice there's an apple at (4, 6) which is directly below me at the same x-coordinate. This is very convenient! If I move DOWN twice, I can reach it: (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 (4, 6).\n\nHowever, I need to be careful about the enemy snake at (5, 7). If I move to (4, 7), we'd be adjacent to each other, which could be risky if they move LEFT toward me.\n\nLet me consider the risk: The enemy snake is at (5, 7). If I move DOWN to (4, 7), we'd be next to each other. But they have several options (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and only one of those (LEFT) would cause a collision with me. The apple at (4, 6) is very tempting and efficiently positioned.\n\nI think the reward outweighs the risk here. Moving DOWN puts me on the direct path to the apple at (4, 6), and even if the enemy snake moves LEFT to (4, 7) next turn, I'll already be there first since I'm moving there this turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (4, 7), I should move DOWN again to (4, 6) to collect the apple, unless the enemy snake moves into a threatening position that requires me to adjust my path.\n\nDOWN"
