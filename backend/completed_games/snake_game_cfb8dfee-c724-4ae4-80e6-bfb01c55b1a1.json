          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. The snake's head is at (0,2), and the body is none, so it's just the head. The apples are at (2,2), (9,8), (8,2), (9,5), (7,4). The enemy snake's head is at (2,0) with no body. Both have 0 apples so far.\n\nFirst, I need to check all possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Then eliminate any that are deadly.\n\nStarting with the current position (0,2). The possible directions:\n\nUP would take the head to (0,3). Is that within the board? The board goes up to 9,9. Wait, the coordinates are (X from 0-9, Y from 0-9). The head is at (0,2). So moving UP (Y increases) to (0,3), which is okay. But need to check if that cell is safe.\n\nDOWN would go to (0,1). That's within the board.\n\nLEFT would go to (-1,2), which is outside the board. So that's a death. So LEFT is invalid.\n\nRIGHT would go to (1,2). That's within the board.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check each direction for collisions:\n\nFor UP (0,3):\n\n- No snakes' body in that cell. The enemy snake's head is at (2,0), so no collision. Also not moving into own body. So safe.\n\nDOWN (0,1):\n\nSame check. No body there. Safe.\n\nRIGHT (1,2):\n\nIn the board state, the current snake's head is at 0,2. The body is none. So moving to 1,2. The enemy's head is at 2,0. So 1,2 is empty. So safe.\n\nNow, the danger is that after moving, the next step can't go back into that position, but since the body is empty, maybe not a problem yet.\n\nBut wait, when moving RIGHT to (1,2), the next move's previous head position would be (0,2), which would be the new body segment. So if you move into a new position, the body doesn't exist yet. So moving RIGHT to (1,2) would make the new head at 1,2, and no body yet. So that's okay.\n\nNow, considering the next step. The goal is to collect apples. The closest apple is (2,2), which is two steps to the right. Alternatively, other apples are further away. So moving right would get closer to (2,2). Also, (7,4) is down and right from here. But (2,2) is immediately accessible if you move right twice.\n\nBut each turn, you can only move once. So maybe moving RIGHT first step towards (2,2). But maybe the enemy is moving towards you? Let's check the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (2,0). They could move in any direction. But since they have no body, their movement could be in any direction. However, since they have zero apples, they might not be trying to block us. But we need to avoid a head-on collision. If we move RIGHT to (1,2) and the enemy moves to (1,0) or something, maybe not an issue. But if both snakes move towards each other, that could be a problem.\n\nWait, the rules state that if two heads move into the same cell, both die. So if I move UP to (0,3) and the enemy moves to (0,3), that would kill us both. But the enemy's current position is (2,0). To reach (0,3), they'd need to move left and up. Unless they choose to move towards us. But since we don't control the enemy, we can't predict their moves. However, the decision here is to choose a move that doesn't lead to a collision even if the enemy moves in the worst-case direction. Wait, but according to the rules, all snakes move simultaneously. So it's possible that the enemy moves in a way that causes a collision with us.\n\nBut the move elimination step in step 2 is to eliminate any move that would immediately kill us. That includes collisions with other snakes' bodies or heads in the new position. However, since the enemy's movement is unknown, we can't predict if they'll move into our new head position. Therefore, in step 2, we only consider the immediate result of our own move. Because the enemy's movement is also happening, but we can't know what they'll do. Therefore, we can only check for positions that are safe regardless of the enemy's movement. Wait, no. The rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So the check is against the current state's snakes' bodies and heads. Because when moving, the enemy's new position is unknown. But according to the rules, when you move, you die if your new head is in any snake's body (including your own) or in another snake's head (since all move at the same time). Wait, this is a bit tricky.\n\nThe actual collision rules:\n\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. So this is based on the positions after the move. But since all snakes move simultaneously, the enemy's head and body positions after the move could overlap with ours. However, for the purpose of checking if a move is safe, we need to consider that the enemy might move into our new head position, or we might move into their new head position. But since we can't predict the enemy's move, how can we check for collision?\n\nWait, the rule for step 2 is to eliminate moves that would immediately kill us. But \"immediately\" in this context might refer to the move itself, considering the current positions of all snakes. Because the enemy's movement hasn't happened yet. So when you choose a direction, you have to check if, in the next state (after your move and the enemy's move), there's a collision. But since we don't know where the enemy will go, this is impossible to check. Therefore, the collision check for step 2 must be based on the current positions. Because the rules state that during a move, all snakes move at the same time. So when you choose a direction, you have to check if your new head position collides with any snake's body (current or new) or head (current or new). But since we can't know the enemy's new position, perhaps the collision check in step 2 is only against the current positions. Or maybe the problem is that the enemy's movement could result in a collision even if our move is safe in the current state.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me re-read the rules.\n\nRule: If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. So the body refers to the current state's bodies, or the new state's? Because after all snakes move, their bodies change. For example, if the enemy moves their head into our body, but our body is static until after the move. Wait, the snake's body segments are determined by their previous positions. So when you move, your body is your previous head positions. Similarly for other snakes. So when checking for collision during the move, the new head position (after your move) must not be in any snake's new body or new head position. But since we don't know where the enemy will move, we can't accurately check for collisions. Therefore, the step 2 in the decision process is to eliminate moves that would kill us regardless of the enemy's move. That is, check if our new head position is in the current positions of any snake's body or head. Because even if the enemy moves, their current position is known. Wait, no. For example, if the enemy's head is at (2,0), and we move right to (1,2). The enemy could move up to (2,1), which doesn't collide with our new head. But if they move left to (1,0), then our head is at (1,2), which doesn't collide. So the collision check in step 2 is only against the current positions of all snakes. Because the enemy's movement is unknown. Therefore, in step 2, we only check if our new head position is in the current bodies or heads of any snake. Because if it is, then regardless of the enemy's movement, we would die. However, if the enemy moves into our new head position, that would be a collision, but since we can't predict that, maybe step 2 doesn't account for that. But according to the rules, the collision check is based on the new positions after all moves. But since we can't know the enemy's move, perhaps the step 2 is to eliminate moves where our new head is in any current snake's body or head. Because even if the enemy moves, their current body or head positions are known. So for example, if our new head is in the enemy's current body, then that's a collision. But if the enemy moves away, maybe not. Wait, no. Because the collision happens when the new head is in any snake's body (including your own) after the move. But the bodies after the move are the previous positions. So for example, when you move, your new head is (x,y), and your body is the previous head positions. Similarly for other snakes. So the collision check is against the new body and head positions of all snakes. But since we don't know where the enemy will move, we can't check for collisions that result from their movement. Therefore, the step 2 in the decision process must only check for collisions based on the current state's positions. Because the enemy's movement is unknown. Therefore, in step 2, we check if our new head position is in the current bodies or heads of any snake. Because if it is, then even if the enemy moves, we would have collided in that move. Wait, no. Because the enemy's movement could cause their body to move. For example, if the enemy's head is at (2,0) and they move up to (2,1), then their body would be at (2,0). So if our new head is at (2,0), that would collide with their new body? Or their new head?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me check the exact rule again:\n\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\nThe \"body\" here refers to the segments of the snake's body. When a snake moves, their body segments are the previous positions of their head. So for each snake, after moving, their body is their previous head plus the previous body. So when checking for collision, after all snakes have moved, your new head must not be in any snake's new body or new head.\n\nBut since we can't know where the enemy will move, we can't accurately check for collisions. Therefore, the step 2 in the decision process must eliminate moves where our new head position is in the current positions of any snake's body or head. Because even if the enemy moves, if our new head is in their current body or head, that would be a collision. However, if the enemy moves away, perhaps not. But according to the rules, the collision is checked after all movements. So the correct way is to check if, after all snakes have moved (including the enemy), our head is in any snake's body or head. But since we can't predict the enemy's move, we can't do that. Therefore, the step 2 is to eliminate moves where our new head is in the current positions (before the move) of any snake's body or head. Because if our new head is in the enemy's current head or body, then even if they move, we might collide. Wait, no. For example, if the enemy's head is at (2,0) and we move into (2,0), then regardless of their move, our head would be in their previous position (if they didn't move there) or new. But if they move away, then their new head is elsewhere, but our head is in their previous position. Which would be part of their new body. Because when the enemy moves, their new body is their previous head. So if we move into their previous head position (current head), then after they move, that cell becomes part of their body. So our head would be in their new body, causing a collision. Therefore, moving into any current snake's head or body positions is a collision, because after the move, that cell becomes part of their body (if they moved away) or their head (if they stayed). Therefore, in step 2, we must check if our new head position is in any current snake's head or body. Because that would result in a collision regardless of their movement. Because their current head or body positions will become part of their new body after they move. So for example, if we move into the enemy's current head position (2,0), then after they move, their new body includes their previous head (2,0), so our head is now in their new body. Therefore, that's a collision. Therefore, step 2 must check if our new head is in any current snake's body or head. Because that would result in a collision after the move.\n\nSo in this case, the current snake's head is at (0,2), body is none. The enemy's head is at (2,0), body none.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP to (0,3): check if (0,3) is in any current snake's body or head. Current positions: our head (0,2), enemy head (2,0). So no collision. So UP is safe.\n\nDOWN to (0,1): same check. Safe.\n\nRIGHT to (1,2): check if (1,2) is in any current snake's body or head. Current positions: (0,2) and (2,0). So (1,2) is empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT is invalid.\n\nSo all three moves are safe in step 2.\n\nNow, step 3: among the safe moves, prefer those that either help collect apples or keep future options open.\n\nThe apples are at (2,2), (8,2), (9,5), etc. The closest apple is (2,2), which is two steps to the right. So moving right towards (2,2) seems good. Alternatively, moving UP might not be as efficient. Let's see:\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (1,2), then next turn we can move RIGHT again to (2,2) to collect the apple. That's a good path. Alternatively, moving UP might not get us closer to any apple. The other apples are at (9,8), which is far away. So moving right is better.\n\nBut also need to consider future moves. For example, moving right to (1,2) leaves us with the option to go right again. If we move UP to (0,3), then next steps would require moving right multiple times, but maybe that's possible. However, (0,3) is further from the apples. Let's see:\n\n(0,3) to (2,2) would require moving right twice and down once. But that's more steps. So moving right is better.\n\nBut also, need to avoid getting trapped. For example, if we move UP, then next moves could be constrained. But in this case, since the snake is only the head, moving up or down or right are all possible.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy's possible moves. The enemy's head is at (2,0). If they move up to (2,1), then next turn they could be closer. But since we don't control them, we can't predict. However, if we move right to (1,2), and the enemy moves left to (1,0), then next turn, our head is at (1,2), their head is at (1,0). Then if we move right to (2,2), which is an apple. But the enemy could move into (2,0) again, but that's their own movement. However, the main thing is to avoid collisions. So moving right seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,1). That's closer to the apple at (7,4)? Not really. (0,1) is still far. So moving right is better.\n\nSo the best move is RIGHT. That brings us closer to the (2,2) apple. Also, maintaining options for future moves. If we move right, we can continue moving right or turn up/down. But moving up might not be as effective.\n\nWait, but the apple at (2,2) is directly to the right. So moving right once gets us to (1,2), then next turn moving right again to (2,2) to collect the apple. That's two moves. But each move is a turn. So in this case, moving right now is a step towards that apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if we move RIGHT to (1,2), the next move could be RIGHT again. But if the enemy moves in a way that blocks us. But since we can't predict, we have to assume that the enemy might not do that. So the best move is RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a scenario where moving UP could lead to a better position. For example, if the apple at (9,8) is reachable, but that's too far. So the closest is (2,2). So RIGHT is best.\n\nSo the final move should be RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide the next move for my snake. The current head is at (2,2), and the body is at (1,2). The apples available are at (9,8), (8,2), (9,5), (7,4), (1,7). The last move was RIGHT, so the head moved from (1,2) to (2,2). The rationale was also RIGHT, so the same move again.\n\nFirst, I need to check which moves are safe. Let's consider each direction:\n\nUP: From (2,2) moving up would take me to (2,3). Let me check if that's a safe position. The board has some apples and other snakes. Looking at the current board state: \n\nLooking at row 2 (which is y=2), the positions are [T,1], meaning my head is at (2,2) and the body is at (1,2). Moving up to (2,3) would be adjacent to (2,2). Now, checking if (2,3) is occupied. From the board state given, in row 3 (y=3), there's a '.' at x=2. So (2,3) is empty. Also, need to check if any other snake's head or body is there. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with no body. So UP seems safe.\n\nDOWN: Moving down from (2,2) would be (2,1). But looking at the board's y=1 row, there's a '.' at x=2. So that's empty. So possible.\n\nLEFT: Moving left from (2,2) would be (1,2), but that's my current body segment. So that's invalid. Because moving into your own body is a kill. So LEFT is not allowed.\n\nRIGHT: Moving right to (3,2). Check if that's safe. The board at y=2, x=3 is a '.'. Also, check other snakes. Enemy is at (4,0), so no conflict. So RIGHT is possible.\n\nWait, but wait. The last move was RIGHT. The last move's rationale was RIGHT. Now, the next move. The problem says that if you move directly backwards into your own body, that's a kill. So, after moving RIGHT, the body is now [(2,2), (1,2)]? Wait, the snake's body is ordered head-to-tail. The current body is [(1,2)], which was the previous position. So after moving RIGHT, the head is (2,2), and the body is the previous head position (1,2). So the next move's body would be the previous head. So when moving in a direction, the new head is the direction, and the body is the previous head positions.\n\nSo, for the next move, possible directions:\n\nUP: (2,3). Check if that's safe. Not in own body (since current body is (1,2)), and not in enemy's body. Enemy's head is at (4,0), so no. So UP is safe.\n\nDOWN: (2,1). Also safe.\n\nRIGHT: (3,2). Safe.\n\nLEFT: (1,2) which is the current body. So that's invalid. So possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, need to evaluate which of these moves is best. The objectives are to collect apples and avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the apples: (8,2) is at (x=8, y=2). That's on the same row as my head. If I can reach that apple, it's a good target. But how?\n\nFrom current position (2,2), moving RIGHT would take me to (3,2), then (4,2), etc. But (8,2) is 6 steps to the right. But other apples might be closer.\n\nAnother apple is (8,2), which is on the same y=2. If I move right, I can get closer. But I need to check if that's possible without dying. Also, the enemy snake is at (4,0). So if I move right, maybe the enemy could move in a way that collides with me. But since enemies move simultaneously, I need to consider their possible moves.\n\nBut since I don't have info on the enemy's next move, maybe I should assume they might act optimally. However, the enemy's current position is (4,0) with no body. If they move, say, UP, they could go to (4,1), but that's not directly conflicting with my path. But if I move right, perhaps I can reach the apple at (8,2) over time.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (1,7) is at (1,7). That's up and left from my current position. But to get there, I might need to move up and left. But moving left is invalid now because it's my body. So maybe not.\n\nThe apple at (7,4) is further away. (9,5) and (9,8) are also far.\n\nSo the closest apple is (8,2) at (8,2). To reach that, moving right is the way. But each move right would take me closer. However, after moving right once to (3,2), then next move right to (4,2), etc. But need to make sure that each step is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving up or down could lead to other apples. For example, (9,8) is way up, but that's a long path. (9,5) is also up and right. (7,4) is up and left.\n\nBut given the current position, moving right seems the best bet to approach the apple at (8,2). Also, since the enemy is at (4,0), if I move right, maybe they could move up or right, but their movement isn't known. However, if I can reach the apple at (8,2), that's a good gain.\n\nAnother consideration: moving up or down might not be as effective. For example, moving up to (2,3) would take me away from the (8,2) apple but maybe towards (7,4) or (9,5). But (7,4) is at (7,4), which is two steps up and two left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (2,1) could be a way to avoid getting stuck, but not sure.\n\nAnother thing: after moving right, the next move would have the body at (2,2). So if I keep moving right, each step would be safe as long as I don't hit the body. But since the body is behind me, moving right again would be safe. So maybe a series of RIGHT moves would be possible until I reach (8,2). But need to check if any obstacles are in the way.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apples are at (9,8), (8,2), (9,5), (7,4), (1,7). The snake's path to (8,2) is possible. The cells from (2,2) to (8,2) are all '.' except for the apple at (8,2). So moving right each time would be safe until reaching (8,2). But need to check if any other snakes are in that path. The enemy is at (4,0), which is not in that row. So moving right seems safe.\n\nBut also, need to think about future moves. If I keep moving right, I can collect the apple at (8,2), then maybe proceed to other apples. However, after collecting that apple, the snake would grow by one segment. So the body would be longer, which could restrict movement.\n\nBut for now, the immediate next move is to choose between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Since LEFT is invalid.\n\nSo which of these is best? Let's consider each:\n\nUP: (2,3). Safe. But not closer to any apple. Maybe allows for future moves.\n\nDOWN: (2,1). Safe. Similarly, not closer.\n\nRIGHT: (3,2). Closer to (8,2). So this is better for collecting apples.\n\nSo RIGHT is the best option here. Because it's the only move that brings me closer to an apple. The other moves don't contribute to that.\n\nBut wait, what about collision with other snakes? The enemy is at (4,0). If I move right, they might move in a direction that could collide. For example, if the enemy moves up to (4,1), then next turn, if I move right to (4,2), but the enemy is at (4,1), which is not in my path. So no collision. But if the enemy moves right to (5,0), then I'm at (3,2), so no collision. So seems safe.\n\nAnother thing: the last move was RIGHT. So moving RIGHT again would be continuing in the same direction. The rationale for the last move was RIGHT, so maybe continuing is good.\n\nSo the conclusion is to move RIGHT again. That would bring me closer to the apple at (8,2). The other moves don't help in that direction. Therefore, the best move is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",
