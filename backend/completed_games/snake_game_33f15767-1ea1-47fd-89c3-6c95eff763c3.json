The enemy snake is way over at **(7,\u202f6)**, so we have plenty of breathing room for now.\n\n**First the safety check**  \n- **UP \u2192 (2,\u202f4)** \u2013 empty, but no apple.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,\u202f2)** \u2013 apple \u2705 (good point, but it drops us into the lower\u2011half of the board).  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,\u202f3)** \u2013 empty, no apple.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,\u202f3)** \u2013 **apple** \u2705 and it nudges us toward the left side where we can start hemming in the opponent later.\n\nAll four moves are alive, none run us into a wall or a body.\n\n**Strategic thinking**  \nWe want to grow *and* keep our options open. Snagging an apple now is a no\u2011brainer. The left\u2011side apple at **(1,\u202f3)** does two things:  \n\n1. Gives us a point *right now*.  \n2. Moves our head toward the western edge, where we can later swing up to **(0,\u202f5)** or down to control the lower\u2011left corridor \u2013 classic boxing material.  \n\nGoing down to **(2,\u202f2)** is also tasty, but it tucks us into the bottom half where the opponent could still drift far away, and we\u2019d have to fight our way back up later. The left route keeps us near the board\u2019s border, a natural \u201cwall\u201d we can use as a teammate.\n\n**Future\u2011proofing**  \nAfter we eat the apple at (1,\u202f3) our body will be two cells long: head at (1,\u202f3), tail at (2,\u202f3). We\u2019ll still have three safe exits (up, left, down) for the next turn, so we won\u2019t be trapped. Plus we\u2019ll be sitting on a column that the enemy will have to cross if he ever wants to cut us off, giving us a tactical choke point.\n\n**Bottom line** \u2013 grab the apple on the left and start staking out the western side of the board. Let\u2019s get that point and set the stage for a future trap! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83e\udd47\n\n**MOVE**  \nLEFT",

It lets us stay mobile, wait for the opponent to commit to the apple, and then decide whether to shadow them or swing to the right\u2011hand side where the bulk of the remaining apples lie.\n\nGiven the equal scores, the safest way to stay in the game\u202f\u2014\u202fand still keep plenty of future options for a later trap\u202f\u2014\u202fis to **rise up** and keep the board open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n1.

The opponent is still three columns away, so we keep a healthy corridor on the left side of the board.  \n3. **Future flexibility:** from (3,8) we can swing up to the top\u2011row apple at (1,9) in two turns, or dive back down toward the dense apple cluster around (8,5) once we\u2019ve reclaimed the lead.  \n4. **No head\u2011on risk:** the opponent cannot reach (3,8) this turn, and any of their three legal moves keep them at least two cells away.\n\nGoing **UP** would waste a turn for no apple, and **LEFT** pushes us into the far\u2011left wall without immediate reward. The aggressive, point\u2011gaining route is clearly the right\u2011hand side.\n\n**Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f7:** RIGHT \u2192 snag apple at (3,8).  \n- **Turn\u202f8:** React to opponent\u2019s move; if they head UP we stay tight and swing LEFT toward (2,8) \u2192 (1,9) for another apple.  \n- **Turn\u202f9+**: Keep the opponent trapped in the central corridor while we sweep the left\u2011side apple field and then pivot to the right\u2011side bounty.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that fruit and flip the scoreboard!  \n\n**RIGHT**",
