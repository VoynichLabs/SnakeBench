He could close the gap FAST if we're not careful.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES:**\n*   **UP (2,7) -> (2,8):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE. Puts me closer to that apple at (1,8) for next turn.\n*   **DOWN (2,7) -> (2,6):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE. But that moves me AWAY from most apples and closer to the enemy's starting area. Feels defensive.\n*   **LEFT (2,7) -> (1,7):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE. Gets me closer to the wall, but also closer to apples at (1,8) and (1,6).\n*   **RIGHT (2,7) -> (3,7):** Empty space. \u2705 SAFE. This moves me TOWARDS the enemy head. A POWER MOVE! Could we cut him off from the left side of the board?\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nWe need to control the board, not just chase apples. Right now, Snake #1 is to our right. If we move RIGHT, we threaten to cut off his access to the entire left side. We can then use the top and bottom edges as walls to box him in. We have equal length, so we can't force a head-on collision yet, but we can start setting the trap. BE THE AGGRESSOR. DOMINATE THE SPACE.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP feels safe but passive. DOWN is just running away. LEFT is okay. But RIGHT? RIGHT IS A STATEMENT. We're coming for you, snake #1! Let's start applying pressure IMMEDIATELY! \ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT",

TIME TO COOK! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nOkay, my head is at (3,7), enemy head is at (5,6). That puts him diagonally down-right from me. He's TWO spaces away in x and ONE space down in y. He could go LEFT/UP to (4,6) and be RIGHT next to me. Or he could go UP to (5,7) and we'd be side-by-side. THIS IS A CRITICAL POSITION!\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES:**\n*   **UP (3,7) -> (3,8):** Empty. \u2705 SAFE. Gets me closer to top wall apples. But does it pressure the enemy? Not really.\n*   **DOWN (3,7) -> (3,6):** Empty. \u2705 SAFE. Puts me RIGHT next to the apple at (4,2)? Wait no, that's far. But it brings me closer to the enemy's y-level. Feels reactive.\n*   **LEFT (3,7) -> (2,7):** Empty. \u2705 SAFE. Moves me AWAY from the enemy. Feels like running. Are we scared? HELL NO. \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (3,7) -> (4,7):** EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE. THIS IS THE MOVE! This is AGGRESSION! This cuts off the enemy's potential path LEFT. It puts my head ONE space above his potential UP move to (5,7). We're establishing DOMINANCE on the right side of the board!\n\n**PREDICTING ENEMY MOVES:**\nWhat's snake #1 thinking? He sees me at (3,7). His smartest move is probably UP to (5,7) to try and get space and maybe go for the apple at (6,7). If I go RIGHT to (4,7), I'm directly above where his head would be if he goes LEFT to (4,6). I'm boxing him in from above! If he goes DOWN to (5,5), I gain even more board control. THIS IS A WIN-WIN PRESSURE PLAY!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nWe are making a power move to the RIGHT. Our goal is to use the top-right corner as a wall. We want to force the enemy down towards the bottom-left where there are fewer apples. If he tries to fight us for the top, we have to be ready to engage. Remember, with equal length, head-on collisions are bad. But if we can get just ONE apple lead, we can start forcing those fights! DOMINATE THE SPACE. BOX HIM IN.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's assess the board \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy \ud83d\udc0d is at **(6,6)**. He's TWO spaces RIGHT and ONE space DOWN from us. His potential moves:\n*   **UP to (6,7)**: Would be RIGHT next to us horizontally. Could set up a future head-on if not careful.\n*   **LEFT to (5,6)**: Gets closer, reduces the gap.\n*   **DOWN to (6,5)**: Moves away, probably going for the apple at **(4,2)**? Weak move.\nWe want to pressure him! Our aggressive RIGHT move last turn paid off \u2013 we're positioned to DOMINATE the top-right quadrant \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CHECKING OUR MOVES:**\n*   **UP to (4,8)**: \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. Puts us closer to the apple cluster at the top (like **(1,8)**). But does it pressure the enemy? Not directly. It's a growth move.\n*   **DOWN to (4,6)**: \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. THIS IS THE MOVE! It cuts OFF the enemy's potential path UP to **(6,7)**. If he goes UP, we are directly below him, threatening a future vertical pinch! If he goes LEFT to **(5,6)**, we are adjacent, forcing a confrontation SOONER. This is AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING. We are boxing him towards the center-left where there are few apples!\n*   **LEFT to (3,7)**: \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. This retreats from the pressure. Are we scared? NO. This gives up the ground we just gained. WEAK.\n*   **RIGHT to (5,7)**: \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. Also keeps pressure, but going DOWN feels more active in cutting off his options. RIGHT might allow him to slide under us if he goes DOWN.\n\n**PREDICTING ENEMY MOVES:**\nHe'll likely go for an apple or try to avoid us. The closest apple to him is at **(6,7)** \ud83c\udf4e. If he goes UP for it, and we go DOWN to **(4,6)**, we are perfectly positioned to challenge him next turn! If he runs DOWN or LEFT, we claim the valuable top-right space. WIN-WIN.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nWe are initiating the BOX-IN strategy. By moving DOWN, we aim to control the vertical line between him and the top apples. Our goal is to force him into the less valuable bottom-half of the board or into a head-on collision where we have the advantage. Keep pressuring! DON'T LET HIM BREATHE \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",

Last turn we moved **DOWN** to **(4,6)**, applying PRESSURE to the enemy! Our plan was to cut off his path UP and force a confrontation. DID IT WORK?!\n\nCHECKING THE CURRENT STATE:\n- **OUR HEAD (ID 0): (4, 6)**\n- **ENEMY HEAD (ID 1) WAS at (6, 7)**\n- WAIT. Their head is now at **(6,7)** and their body trail is **[(6,6)]**. That means on Turn 2, THEY MOVED **UP!** THEY TOOK THE APPLE AT **(6,7)**!!! \ud83c\udf4e THEY ARE NOW LONGER THAN US! Score is 0 vs 1. THEY GOT THE FIRST BLOOD! \ud83d\ude21\n\n*Current Safe Moves Check (from (4,6)):*\n- **UP to (4,7):** \u2753 *WAS* our old position. Is it safe? The enemy's body is at (6,6) and tail at (6,6)... WAIT. Is (4,7) empty? Looking at the board... YES! It's marked with a '.' on row 7! This is SAFE! Good recovery option.\n- **DOWN to (4,5):** \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. Moves us away from the enemy, towards bottom apples. But does this retreat? Are we scared? \ud83e\udd14\n- **LEFT to (3,6):** \u2705 SAFE. Empty cell. Takes us towards the left side, AWAY from the enemy. Feels like running.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6):** \u2753 Is this safe? The enemy's BODY segment is at (6,6). That's diagonally adjacent. Moving RIGHT to (5,6) is NOT touching any snake part. It's EMPTY on the board! \u2705 SAFE. This is AGGRESSIVE! Puts us right next to the enemy's HEAD at (6,7)! We'd be ADJACENT HORIZONTALLY!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION TIME! \ud83d\udc0d** Their head is at (6,7). Where can they go?\n- UP to (6,8): Possible, but riskier near the top wall. There's an apple at (9,8)... tempting.\n- DOWN to (6,6): BACKWARDS into their own body? \ud83d\udc80 THAT'S SUICIDE! THEY CAN'T GO DOWN! THEY'D DIE! CHAT, IS HE COOKED?!\n- LEFT to (5,7): SAFE. Empty cell. This is the most logical move if he sees us. It avoids a direct confrontation.\n- RIGHT to (7,7): SAFE. Empty cell. Also possible, moving along the top.\n\nHOLD UP! THE ENEMY CAN'T GO DOWN! They are TRAPPED vertically between the top wall and their own body! Their only safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT (and UP, but that's riskier near the edge)! THIS IS OUR CHANCE! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**STRATEGY: THE PINCH IS ON!**\nWe have a +1 length disadvantage, but a HUGE positional advantage! He's on the top edge with limited moves. If we go **RIGHT to (5,6)**, we are directly to his LEFT and DOWN. If he goes LEFT to (5,7), we are RIGHT BELOW HIM, setting up a potential trap next turn! If he goes RIGHT, we still control the center. We need to press this advantage NOW! Don't let him escape to the left side of the board!\n\nGoing UP or LEFT feels like giving up the pressure. DOWN is just running away. RIGHT is the ONLY AGGRESSIVE, BOARD-CONTROLLING MOVE! Let's force him into a mistake! He's already making bad decisions (trapping himself against the wall). CAPITALIZE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):** We are initiating Phase 2: The Cornering. Enemy is vulnerable on the north wall. Our goal is to mirror his LEFT/RIGHT movements, staying one row below him, and slowly push him towards the corner (9,9) or force a disastrous move. Do not let him slip past us to the south. If he goes RIGHT, we go RIGHT. If he goes LEFT, we go LEFT. We stay on his tail! He has nowhere to go but into our trap! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

So if he goes DOWN, he moves into our current position. Since we're moving away, is it safe? NO! Because moves are simultaneous!

Going DOWN to (6,4) retreats and gives up our positional advantage. We need to be AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):** Phase 5: The Shadow. Enemy is above us and limited.
