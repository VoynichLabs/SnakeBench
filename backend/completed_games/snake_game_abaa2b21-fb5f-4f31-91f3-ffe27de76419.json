This gets me closer to the apple at (3, 5) which is on the same y-coordinate. From (7, 5), I'd be 4 cells away from that apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moves me to (7, 3). Takes me away from most apples.\n- **LEFT**: Moves me to (6, 4). Doesn't immediately help with any specific apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves me to (8, 4). Takes me away from apples.\n\nThe apple at (3, 5) is a good target. Moving UP gets me to y=5, matching the y-coordinate of both (3, 5) and (0, 5). This puts me on the same horizontal line as two apples, which will make it easier to collect them in subsequent moves by going LEFT.\n\nThe enemy at (4, 8) is moving somewhere from that position. If it goes UP, it hits the wall at y=9. If it goes DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, it moves away. Either way, heading towards the apples at y=5 seems safe.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to reach y=5, then systematically move LEFT to collect apples at (3, 5) and (0, 5). These apples on the left side of the board offer a clear, efficient path. After securing those, reassess based on enemy position.\n\nUP",

It keeps me safe and gets me one step closer to the apple at (0, 8), which is my nearest target. After this move, I'll be adjacent to that apple and can collect it next turn.\n\n**Strategy for future turns:**\nContinue UP to collect (0, 8) at turn 10. Then pivot RIGHT to collect (1, 7), which is also close by. The upper-left region with these two apples is safe and away from the enemy snake. After that, evaluate whether to go for (3, 9) or swing down to (1, 0). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements.\n\nUP",

DEATH - Invalid\n   - My body occupies (1, 7)\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 5)**:\n   - Valid move (within bounds, y=5 is valid)\n   - No apple here\n   - Safe from my body\n   - Continues me toward (1, 0) apple\n   - Enemy at (4, 4) is 3 cells away horizontally - not a threat\n   - This is the efficient path toward the closest apple\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 6)**:\n   - Valid move (within bounds)\n   - No apple here\n   - Safe from my body (body is at (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7))\n   - Wait, let me check: (0, 7) is part of my body\n   - (0, 6) is adjacent to (0, 7) but not the same cell, so it's safe\n   - This move would put me in the corner area with limited space\n   - Reduces options for pursuing apples efficiently\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 6)**:\n   - Valid move (within bounds)\n   - No apple here\n   - Safe from my body\n   - Opens up the board to the right\n   - Could pursue (3, 9), (7, 7), or (9, 8)\n   - More flexible positioning\n\n**Analysis:**\nDOWN is the most efficient move right now. I have a clear, direct path to (1, 0) which is just 6 moves away on the same column. The enemy snake is far enough away (4 cells horizontally, same y-level) that it's not a threat. Continuing DOWN keeps me on track for collecting the next apple while maintaining safe distance from walls and the enemy.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nContinue DOWN to collect (1, 0) at turn 20. After that, reassess the board. With 5 apples total, I'll be well on my way. The enemy snake hasn't collected any apples yet, so maintaining my lead and methodically collecting reachable apples is the safest strategy. After (1, 0), consider moving right toward (3, 0) or the upper apples depending on board state.\n\nDOWN",

I can see that (3, 9) is directly above my current position. By moving UP, I'm moving in a straight line toward an apple cluster at the top of the board.

Since it only has a head, it's unpredictable\n- Keep moving up the left-center area to collect (3, 9), then navigate right to collect the other top apples\n\nUP",

I'm on a direct vertical line with the apple at (3, 9), and continuing straight up is the most efficient path. I'm 5 cells away from the apple. The enemy snake at (4, 4) is harmless - it's a single-cell snake with no body, so minimal threat.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue moving UP along x=3 to reach (3, 9) at turn 30.
