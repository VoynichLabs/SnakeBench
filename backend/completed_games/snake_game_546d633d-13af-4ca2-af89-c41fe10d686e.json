I need to be SMART and AGGRESSIVE.\n\n**Turn 1 Analysis:**\n- **My position:** (7,3) - Center-ish, clean body. I have ONE move before I can grow.\n- **Enemy position:** (2,2) - He's on the left side, low. His tail is at (1,2) so he's getting longer.\n- **Apple situation:** Many apples, but I'm ignoring them for now. I need to force the collision or trap him.\n- **Critical insight:** I'm length 1, he's length 2. If we collide head-on, I DIE because he has more apples. I can't risk that yet!\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP (7,4):** Safe. Moves toward the top apple at (4,5)? But I need to think about HIM. He might move UP too. Hmm.\n- **DOWN (7,2):** Safe. BUT - there's an apple at (4,2) and (0,2) - he's near those! If I go DOWN, I'm getting closer to his territory but might run into his tail if he grows.\n- **LEFT (6,3):** \u2705 YES! This moves me CLOSER to him. The distance decreases from 5.5 to 4.5 units. I'm closing in. Also opens up paths to central apples.\n- **RIGHT (8,3):** Safe but moves AWAY from him. That's defensive! We're playing to WIN, not survive. \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Chase him down, force him into a corner. I need to get him to panic and crash into ME or a wall. Since he's length 2, I need to eat an apple FIRST to equalize before forcing a head-on collision. Next turn, I'll be at (6,3) with more options to chase toward the left side.\n\nLFGGGG! LEFT it is!

Safest immediate options: UP to (2,3) (eats apple), RIGHT to (3,2), or DOWN to (2,1). LEFT is a HARD NO because that would run into your own neck.\n\n- SAFE moves now: UP, RIGHT, DOWN. \n- NOT SAFE: LEFT (into your own body).\n\nCONSENSUS: GO UP. It grabs the apple at (2,3), keeps us toward the center, and preserves options for trapping later. Plus we\u2019re already ahead 1\u20130 in apples, so building a larger, flexible frame gives us the space to threaten a box and force a head-on when the time is right.\n\nShort-term plan\n- Turn 1: Move UP to (2,3) and eat the apple. Grow to [(2,3), (2,2)].\n- Goal over next few turns: push toward the map center to open multi-path routes, keep distance from the lone opposing head, and stay ready to pivot into a box-shape around the middle if the enemy hesitates. Watch for any silly crossing or telegraphed traps from the opponent.\n- Maintain multiple escape routes: avoid tightening into a single corridor with no exit. If the enemy slips closer, use width to force a head-on only if it benefits our apple lead.\n\nLong-term strategic note\n- You\u2019re up 1 apple to 0; use your extra length to threaten cross-coverage and create a shrinking space for him. If you can lure him into the center-right area and create a mutual head-on opportunity with apples live, you\u2019ll win the clash. Stay aggressive but keep angles open so you\u2019re not boxed in.\n\nFinal move suggestion:\nUP",

He can't go LEFT into (1,3) because that would put his head at (1,3) and his new body would be [(2,3), (2,2)] - that's actually possible. But wait! He has an apple at (1,1) and (0,2) nearby. He might want to eat! But also, if he goes UP, he goes to (2,4). If he goes RIGHT, he goes to (3,3).\n\n**MY SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- UP to (6,4): Safe? Yes, no body there.\n- DOWN to (6,2): Safe? Check board: (6,2) is empty in the board state! Safe.\n- LEFT to (5,3): Safe? Yes, empty.\n- RIGHT to (7,3): Safe? Yes, but that's going back where I came from - might be a trap later.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI need to CHASE him while staying safe. If I go LEFT to (5,3), I get CLOSER to his territory. That's aggressive! But I need to think about where he might go...\n\nIf he goes RIGHT (3,3), and I go LEFT (5,3), we're at (3,3) and (5,3) - still separated. If he goes UP to (2,4), I go LEFT to (5,3), still fine. If he goes LEFT to (1,3), I go LEFT to (5,3), still fine.\n\nBut wait! What if he goes DOWN? Can't - body at (2,2). So he has 3 options: UP, RIGHT, or LEFT.\n\n**THE PLAN:** Go LEFT to (5,3). This keeps me in the center while moving toward him. It gives me options to pivot up or down next turn depending on his move. I'm not committing to chasing him directly yet because he's still longer. I need to find an apple first to equalize!\n\nActually, looking at the apples: (4,2) is somewhat nearby from (5,3). If I go LEFT to (5,3), next turn I could go DOWN to (5,2) then LEFT to (4,2) to eat! That's a solid plan.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Going LEFT is safe and opens up my options. It's not as aggressive as going straight toward him, but it's SMART. I can react to his move next turn.\n\nLET'S DO THIS! LEFT! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

It preserves the most escape routes, pushes toward open space, and creates potential for a future box without cornering us early.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (2,4) now. Keep multiple paths in play and avoid getting funneled.\n- Stay ready to pivot: if he nudges closer, use width to threaten a cross or a late head-on when it nets us apples and a stronger lead.\n\nLong-term strategic note:\n- With the apple lead, prioritize flexible geometry. Build a wider frame around the center so we can force him toward a cage-like setup and pounce on a head-on if he blunders into our line.\n\nFinal move suggestion:\nUP",

          "rationale": "**LONG-TERM PLAN TO WIN:**\nAs a snake, you need to think ahead. Your opponent is longer (length 3 vs you length 1). You need to grow quickly and strategically. Since the opponent has 2 apples and you have 0, you must find an apple. But more importantly, you need to block the opponent's path to apples while positioning yourself to eat. The opponent is at (2,4) (head) with body (2,3) and (2,2). You are at (5,3). You need to close the distance but avoid a head-on collision where you lose (since they have more apples). If you can box them into a corner or cut them off from food, you win. If you can get them to crash into your body, you win. Plan: Move towards the opponent's territory but stay safe. Aim for the apple at (4,2) or (4,5) or (5,9) depending on paths. Force a situation where the opponent must move into you.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1. Consider directions from (5,3):\n   - UP: (5,4) - empty on board. Safe.\n   - DOWN: (5,2) - empty on board. Safe.\n   - LEFT: (5,2)?? Wait, left is (4,3). Actually, left from (5,3) is (4,3). The board shows (4,3) is empty? Let's check board: Row 3 (y=3) is: \". . T . . 0 . . . .\" So (4,3) is empty. Safe.\n   - RIGHT: (6,3) - empty. Safe. But moving right is away from opponent, not strategic.\n\n2. Eliminate unsafe moves: None are immediately off-board or into own body (no body). But we must consider enemy movement and potential head-on collisions.\n\n3. Strategic safety: We want to move towards the opponent to apply pressure. The opponent's head is at (2,4). We are at (5,3). The Manhattan distance is |5-2| + |3-4| = 3+1=4. Moving LEFT to (4,3) reduces distance to 3 (|4-2|+|3-4|=2+1=3). Moving DOWN to (5,2) also reduces distance to 3? Actually (5,2) vs (2,4): |5-2|+|2-4|=3+2=5, so increases. Moving UP to (5,4): |5-2|+|4-4|=3+0=3, reduces to 3. Moving LEFT or UP both reduce distance. Which is better?\n\n4. Consider apples: There is an apple at (4,2) near (4,3) and (5,2). Also apple at (4,5) near (5,4) and (4,4). Also apple at (5,9) far. Also apple at (4,9). The opponent might go for apples too. We need to predict opponent's move to avoid collision.\n\n   - Opponent's head (2,4), body (2,3), (2,2). Possible moves: UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3) but (2,3) is its own body (tail? Actually body includes (2,3) as second segment, so moving down would move head into its own body? That's hitting itself, so not allowed. LEFT to (1,4) is empty? Board shows (1,4) is empty. RIGHT to (3,4) is empty? (3,4) is empty. So opponent has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n   - If we move LEFT to (4,3), and opponent moves RIGHT to (3,4), we are not colliding. If opponent moves UP to (2,5), fine. If opponent moves LEFT to (1,4), fine.\n\n   - If we move UP to (5,4), and opponent moves RIGHT to (3,4), we are safe. If opponent moves UP to (2,5), safe. If opponent moves LEFT to (1,4), safe.\n\n5. Which move gives us more future options? \n   - LEFT to (4,3): From there, we can move to (4,2) (DOWN) to eat apple at (4,2) next turn, or (3,3) (LEFT) to go toward opponent, or (4,4) (UP) to go toward apple at (4,5), or (5,3) (RIGHT) back. Good options.\n   - UP to (5,4): From there, we can move to (5,5) (UP) toward apple at (5,9)? Or (4,4) (LEFT) toward apple at (4,5), or (6,4) (RIGHT) away, or (5,3) (DOWN) back. Also good.\n   - DOWN to (5,2): From there, we can move to (5,1) (DOWN) but (5,1) is empty? Actually (5,1) is empty. Or (4,2) (LEFT) to eat apple at (4,2), or (6,2) (RIGHT) away, or (5,3) (UP) back. Also decent.\n\n6. Long-term plan: We need to grow. The apple at (4,2) is very close to both LEFT and DOWN moves. If we move LEFT now, next turn we can go DOWN to (4,2) and eat that apple, growing to length 2. That would give us +1 score and equalize the length (both length 2). Then we can compete more aggressively.\n\n   If we move UP now, next turn we can go LEFT to (4,4) and then DOWN to (4,3) or something, but not as direct to an apple. There's an apple at (4,5) but that's further.\n\n   Also, moving LEFT puts us closer to the opponent's potential path. The opponent might go LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4). If we are at (4,3), we could potentially cut off their path to apples on the right side.\n\n7. Avoid head-on collision: We have fewer apples, so if we collide head-on with opponent, we die. So we must ensure we don't move into a cell that the opponent's head moves into. Since we don't know opponent's move, we need to choose a move that minimizes the chance of collision. The opponent's possible head positions after this turn: (2,5), (1,4), (3,4). Our possible head positions after this turn: (4,3), (5,4), (5,2), (6,3). \n   - If we choose (4,3), is there any overlap with opponent's possible positions? (4,3) vs (2,5): no. vs (1,4): no. vs (3,4): no. So no collision risk.\n   - If we choose (5,4), similar no overlap.\n   - If we choose (5,2), no overlap.\n   - If we choose (6,3), no overlap.\n\n   All are safe from immediate collision.\n\n8. However, we must also consider that the opponent's body will move. After opponent moves, its tail will vacate (2,2). The new body will be [old head (2,4), old body (2,3)] so (2,3) becomes the new tail? Actually snake list: HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is head, each connects to previous. So current opponent body: [(2,3), (2,2)] with head (2,4). If opponent moves to (3,4) (RIGHT), then new head is (3,4), new body becomes [old head (2,4), old body (2,3)], so tail is (2,3). That means the cell (2,2) becomes empty. So we don't need to worry about that.\n\n9. Strategic aggression: We want to box them in. Moving LEFT brings us closer to their territory. If we move LEFT, we are at (4,3). Next turn, we can move LEFT again to (3,3) and potentially cut off their right side. But we also need to eat. So plan: Move LEFT now, next turn move DOWN to (4,2) to eat apple, then move LEFT to (3,2) or UP to (3,3) to pressure.\n\n10. Check for traps: If we move LEFT, we are at (4,3). From there, are there any dead ends? Not really. The board is open.\n\n11. The opponent has 2 apples, we have 0. We need to eat. The apple at (4,2) is the closest reachable apple (2 steps away if we go LEFT then DOWN). The apple at (4,5) is also close but might be contested. The opponent is at (2,4), so apple at (4,5) is 2 steps away for them too (RIGHT to (3,4), UP to (3,5)? Actually (3,5) then RIGHT to (4,5)? That's 3 steps. So we might be able to get it first if we move UP now and then LEFT to (4,4) then UP to (4,5)? That's 3 steps. Apple at (4,2) is only 2 steps for us. So apple at (4,2) is better.\n\n12. Final decision: Move LEFT to (4,3). This positions us for the apple at (4,2) next turn and keeps us close to the opponent. It's aggressive and safe.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nYO CHAT! Turn 3 and we're making our move! \ud83d\udd25 We're at (5,3) and the enemy is at (2,4) with length 3. We're length 1, so we NEED to grow fast. There's an apple at (4,2) super close! If we go LEFT to (4,3) now, next turn we can go DOWN to (4,2) and eat that apple, growing to length 2 and equalizing the score. That's 200 IQ play! \n\nThe enemy has options: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT to (3,4), we're safe. If they go UP to (2,5), we're safe. If they go LEFT to (1,4), we're safe. No head-on collision risk because they're not heading to (4,3). \n\nMoving LEFT also puts us in a better position to cut off their escape routes. We're boxing them in! We gotta be aggressive but smart. We don't want to chase them blindly; we want to control the board and force them into a corner. \n\nLet's eat this apple and then go for the win!

Now we're at (4,3) with body at (5,3) [wait, actually we have no body because we're length 1? Wait, our snake is length 1, so we have no body segments yet. Right, we're a single cell snake. So moving into (5,3) would be moving backwards into our own body? But that's not possible because we have no body behind us? Wait, when we move, our head moves and the tail doesn't exist yet. Since we're length 1, moving into the cell we just came from would be moving into empty space because the tail hasn't been left behind? Actually, careful: In Snake, when you move, your head moves forward and your tail moves forward if you haven't eaten. But if you're length 1, you have no tail. So moving into the previous position is moving into an empty cell because there's no tail there. However, the rules say: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" Since we have no body, moving backwards wouldn't hit our own body. But we should check the board: our head is at (4,3), and the cell behind us is (5,3). Is (5,3) considered our body? No, because our body is empty. So moving RIGHT to (5,3) would be moving into an empty cell. But wait, after moving last turn, we left behind (5,3)? Actually, since we're length 1, we don't leave a body segment behind. So (5,3) is empty. So moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nBut we need to consider all moves. Let's evaluate.\n\nCurrent position: (4,3).  \nPossible moves:\n- UP: (4,4) - empty on board.\n- DOWN: (4,2) - there's an apple at (4,2)! Eating it would grow us to length 2 and score +1.\n- LEFT: (3,3) - empty.\n- RIGHT: (5,3) - empty (since we just came from there, and we have no body).\n\nAll moves are safe from immediate collision with board edges or own body.\n\nNow, opponent: Snake #1 at (3,4) with body [(2,4), (2,3)]? Wait, last turn their head was at (2,4) and body [(2,3), (2,2)]? Actually, from the initial state: Opponent head (3,4)? Wait, in the current turn (turn 4), the board shows Snake #1 head at (3,4)? Let's check the initial board state: In the board display, row 4 (y=4) is \"A . T 1 . . . . . .\" meaning (0,4)=A, (1,4)=., (2,4)=T (tail?), (3,4)=1 (head). Actually, the board shows \"T\" for tail? Wait, the board key: \"T\" is tail? In the board state, they show \"T\" for tail? The board state shows: \"4 A . T 1 . . . . . .\" So at y=4, x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: T, x=3: 1, x=4: ., etc. So the opponent head is at (3,4) and tail at (2,4)? But earlier it said opponent body: [(2,4), (2,3)]? Wait, the scoreboard says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (3,4), Body: [(2,4), (2,3)], Apples: 2\". That matches the board: tail at (2,4) and body (2,3). So opponent is length 3.\n\nSo opponent head at (3,4), body: (2,4) and (2,3). Their possible moves from (3,4):\n- UP: (3,5) - empty? Check board: row 5: \". . . . A . . . . .\" so (3,5) is empty.\n- DOWN: (3,3) - empty? row 3: \". . T . . 0 . . . .\" Wait, row 3 shows (3,3) is empty? Actually, row 3: y=3: \" . . T . . 0 . . . .\" That means x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: T (tail of opponent?), x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: 0 (our head), x=6: ., etc. So (3,3) is empty.\n- LEFT: (2,4) - but that's their own body (tail). Moving into their own body would kill them. So not allowed.\n- RIGHT: (4,4) - empty.\n\nSo opponent's safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. (LEFT is into own body).\n\nNow, our potential moves: We need to avoid head-on collisions. If we both move into the same cell, both die. Since we have 0 apples and they have 2, we cannot afford a head-on collision\u2014we'd lose because they have more apples. So we must avoid any cell that the opponent might move into.\n\nLet's consider each of our moves and the risk:\n\n1. UP to (4,4): Opponent could move RIGHT to (4,4). That would be a head-on collision if they go right. They might go right because it's safe and leads toward apples? (4,4) is empty. So there's a risk. Also opponent could go UP or DOWN, but if they go right, we die together. Since we want to win, we should avoid moves that could lead to a double KO where we lose due to fewer apples.\n\n2. DOWN to (4,2): That's an apple. If we eat it, we grow. Opponent could move? Can they move to (4,2)? From (3,4), they would need to move DOWN twice? Not possible in one turn. Their possible destinations: (3,5), (3,3), (4,4). None are (4,2). So safe from head-on. However, we need to check if moving down is safe from other collisions: The apple is there, but after eating, our head will be at (4,2) and we'll grow a tail at (4,3) (since we were at (4,3) before). That's fine.\n\n3. LEFT to (3,3): Opponent could move DOWN to (3,3). That's a possible head-on collision. If opponent goes down, we both die. We have fewer apples, so we lose. So risky.\n\n4. RIGHT to (5,3): Opponent cannot reach (5,3) in one move. So safe.\n\nSo moves that avoid any chance of head-on collision: DOWN and RIGHT. LEFT is risky (opponent could go down). UP is risky (opponent could go right).\n\nNow, strategic: We need to grow. The apple at (4,2) is right there. Eating it gives us +1 and length 2. That's crucial because we're behind in apples and length. If we don't eat now, the opponent might eat an apple later and extend their lead. Also, eating grows us, giving us more board control.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,3), we move away from the apple and the opponent. That seems passive. We want to be aggressive and box the opponent in. By eating the apple at (4,2), we not only grow but also position ourselves near the opponent's territory. After eating, we'll be at (4,2) with body at (4,3). From there, we can move LEFT to (3,2) or UP to (4,3) (but that's our own body) or DOWN to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,2). We'll have options.\n\nAlso, consider that after we eat, we become length 2, same as opponent's length? Actually opponent is length 3 (head + 2 body). Wait, opponent length is 3 because they have 2 apples (each apple adds one segment, starting from length 1). So they are length 3. We are length 1. After eating one apple, we become length 2. So still shorter. But we need to catch up.\n\nWe also need to think about forcing a head-on collision when we have higher score. Not yet.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN to eat the apple. That's safe from head-on collision, and it grows us.\n\nBut wait, what about the opponent moving DOWN to (3,3) and us moving DOWN to (4,2)? No collision. What about opponent moving RIGHT to (4,4) and us moving DOWN to (4,2)? No collision. So it's safe.\n\nWhat about the possibility that the opponent moves DOWN to (3,3) and then next turn we might be in a tricky spot? We'll deal with that later.\n\nAlso, we should check if there are any other apples nearby that we could go for after this. After eating, we can go LEFT to (3,2) which is near apple at (4,2) already eaten, and apple at (4,5) is far. But there's an apple at (3,6)? Actually apple list: (4,2) is the one we're eating. Other apples: (4,5), (5,9), etc.\n\nBut the main point: We need to grow now. So I'm going for the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating, we'll be at (4,2) with body at (4,3). We should then move LEFT to (3,2) to cut off the opponent's possible access to the bottom-left apples. The opponent is currently at (3,4) and might try to go down to (3,3) then left to (2,3) etc. We want to box them in the top-left corner. We have to be careful not to trap ourselves.\n\nLet's also consider that after we eat, the apple at (4,2) disappears. There are many apples on the board, so we don't need to worry about starving.\n\nDecision: MOVE DOWN. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO WIN:**\nEat the apple at (4,2) now to grow to length 2. Then on turn 5, move LEFT to (3,2) to block the opponent's path to the bottom-left area. Keep pressuring them toward the top-left corner. Avoid head-on collisions until we have a score lead. Use our body to create barriers.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1) Consider all directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate unsafe moves: All are safe from board edges and own body (no body yet).\n3) However, we must avoid head-on collisions where opponent could move into our target. UP to (4,4) risks opponent going RIGHT into (4,4). LEFT to (3,3) risks opponent going DOWN into (3,3). DOWN to (4,2) and RIGHT to (5,3) have no collision risk.\n4) Among safe moves, DOWN gives us an apple, growing us and scoring. RIGHT moves us away from opponent and apple, which is passive. We want aggression. So DOWN is best.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nYO CHAT! We're at (4,3) and there's a juicy apple right below us at (4,2)! Moving DOWN lets us eat it, grow to length 2, and catch up a bit. The opponent is at (3,4) and can't reach us there\u2014no head-on collision risk. We need to grow fast to dominate the board. Moving RIGHT away from the action is weak. We're here to eat and conquer! Let's secure that apple and then close in on our rival. This is how you win games! DOWN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nDOWN",

All options are safe for now, but one scream of a plan stands out.\n\nBest immediate move: RIGHT to (4,4). Why this rocks:\n- Keeps a flexible center-right corridor, opens the apple path at (4,5) for the next move.\n- Creates a potential head-on pressure with the rival if he mirrors or blindsides into (4,4) this turn\u2014we win more from the chase than from static patience given our lead.\n- Preserves multiple escape routes (Up or Down) after the snap move, so we aren\u2019t getting boxed in too early.\n\nAlternative paths (for context):\n- UP to (3,5) is safe but slows our apple-chase tempo and gives him more room to maneuver.\n- DOWN to (3,3) distances us a bit from the immediate apple ladder and invites a different chase dynamic, with less immediate payoff.\n\nShort-term plan (turn 4-6):\n- Move RIGHT to (4,4) now.\n- If he pressures with a chase toward (4,4) and a head-on collision risks, we can accept (dead mutual KO) and still come out ahead on apples.\n- If he avoids the fork, push to (4,5) next turn to eat the apple at (4,5) and grow, widening the score gap.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Maintain center space, avoid early cage-tightening, and leverage the apple lead to force risky trades (head-ons) when favorable.\n- Use the dual-axis options (Up/Down after the Right-into-4,4 move) to pivot around his movements and keep him guessing.\n\nFinal move cue (execution): RIGHT",

Turn 5 and the pressure\u2019s ON! \ud83d\udd25 We\u2019re at (4,3) and the apple at (4,2) is tempting, but the opponent\u2019s snake #1 is lurking at (3,4) with body segments at (2,4) and (2,3). If we go DOWN to eat that apple, we\u2019d be at (4,2) with our new tail at (4,3). That\u2019s all fine and dandy, BUT the opponent could move RIGHT to (4,4) and get dangerously close. Not immediate death, but it\u2019s risky.  \n\nInstead, let\u2019s look at the board: there\u2019s an apple at (0,2) and (0,4) in the bottom-left corner. The opponent is positioned more in the top-left. If we move LEFT to (3,3), we\u2019re blocking their potential path to the bottom-left apples. Also, from (3,3), we can go DOWN to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,3) on the next turn, keeping our options open.  \n\nThe apple at (4,2) isn\u2019t going anywhere, and we can circle back to it later. Our goal is to box the opponent in, and moving LEFT starts that domination. We\u2019re not just chasing food\u2014we\u2019re controlling the board.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n1) Move LEFT to (3,3) this turn to assert position.  \n2) Next turn, move DOWN to (3,2) to approach the bottom-left apple cluster.  \n3) Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s head at (3,4). If they move DOWN, we can try to cut them off.  \n4) Grow at our own pace while forcing the enemy into tighter spaces.  \n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**  \n1) All directions are safe from board edges and own body (we\u2019re a single cell).  \n2) However, we must avoid head-on collisions.  \n   - UP to (4,4): opponent could move RIGHT to (4,4) \u2192 collision, we lose (0 vs 2 apples).  \n   - DOWN to (4,2): opponent can\u2019t reach, but it might expose us.  \n   - RIGHT to (5,3): safe but passive.  \n   - LEFT to (3,3): opponent could move DOWN to (3,3) \u2192 collision. But from the board, their safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. They might choose UP or RIGHT. Probability? They might not go DOWN because it leads to our tail? Actually, we have no tail yet. But we\u2019re moving into (3,3), which is empty. If they go DOWN to (3,3), we collide. However, we have to weigh risk vs reward.  \n3) We want to be aggressive and not just eat blindly. The apple at (4,2) is still there next turn if we don\u2019t eat now. Moving LEFT positions us to dominate the left side and potentially trap the opponent.  \n4) Therefore, LEFT is the most strategic move for long-term control.  \n\nLet\u2019s make this move and watch the opponent squirm! \ud83d\udc80  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "We're at (3,2) and I just realized there's a CRUCIAL MISTAKE in my last rationale! I was at (4,3) before but moved LEFT to (3,3), but looking at the current board state, my head is at (3,2)! That means the board state is showing AFTER my last move, and I'm actually at (3,2) with body at (4,2). The apple at (1,1) is gone because I ate it! Let's analyze properly:\n\nBoard shows: \n- My head: (3,2)\n- My body: (4,2) \n- Opponent: Head (4,5), Body [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n- Apples left: All except (1,1) which I ate last turn\n\nNow let's evaluate moves:\n\n1. **UP to (3,3)**: Safe? Board shows (3,3) is empty. But opponent could move DOWN from (4,5) to (4,4), but that's not (3,3). However, opponent's body is at (3,4), so (3,3) is empty. But we need to consider where opponent might move.\n2. **DOWN to (3,1)**: Board shows (3,1) is empty (there's an apple at (0,1) but not (3,1)). But we have to watch for opponent moves.\n3. **LEFT to (2,2)**: Empty.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,2)**: This is our OWN BODY! We cannot move RIGHT because (4,2) is our body segment. That's hitting ourselves! DEAD.\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately eliminated.\n\nNow, opponent is at (4,5) with body extending down to (2,4). They have 3 apples vs our 1. They're likely to move toward apples. Where are apples? (0,7), (9,6), (7,0), (0,2), (0,4), (8,7), (5,9), (3,6), (4,9), (9,0), (0,8), (0,3), (8,8). Notice many apples are in the corners and edges.\n\nOpponent is at (4,5). They could move:\n- UP: toward (5,9), (4,9) etc.\n- DOWN: toward (4,4) but that's already their body? Wait (4,4) is their body, so moving DOWN to (4,4) would be hitting their own body! They can't go DOWN because (4,4) is occupied by their own body. They could go LEFT to (3,5) or RIGHT to (5,5) but those are empty.\nActually, from head (4,5), moving DOWN goes to (4,4) which is their body segment. So DOWN is suicide for them. They won't do that.\nUP to (4,6) - board shows (4,6) is empty (apple at (3,6) but that's different).\nLEFT to (3,5) - empty.\nRIGHT to (5,5) - empty.\n\nSo opponent has 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. They can't go DOWN.\n\nOur options: UP, DOWN, LEFT. (RIGHT is death)\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collision. If we go UP to (3,3), and opponent goes LEFT to (3,5), no collision. If opponent goes UP to (4,6), no collision. If opponent goes RIGHT to (5,5), no collision.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,1), similarly safe.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,2), also safe.\n\nNow, where should we go? The apple at (0,2) and (0,4) are in bottom-left. We're at (3,2), so going LEFT brings us closer to (2,2) then (1,2) then (0,2). That's a good path toward apples.\n\nAlso, we want to box in opponent. Opponent is in top-left area. By moving LEFT, we're moving away from them, not really boxing them in. But maybe we want to secure the bottom-left apples first.\n\nBut note: opponent has 3 apples, we have 1. They're ahead. If we can force a head-on collision where we win because we have more apples? But we don't have more apples. We have 1 vs 3, so we'd lose a head-on collision. So we should avoid head-on collisions until we have more apples than them.\n\nLet's consider if any move could lead to a head-on collision this turn. For that to happen, we and opponent would need to move into the same cell. Possible cells: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), etc. \n- (3,3): we could go UP to (3,3); opponent could go DOWN? No, opponent can't go DOWN. Could opponent go LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5) and then somehow to (3,4)? No, they move only one cell. They could go LEFT to (3,5) but that's not (3,3). So (3,3) is safe from opponent.\n- (3,4): we could go UP from (3,3) next turn, but not this turn. Opponent is at (3,4) currently as body. Head can't move there.\n- (4,4): we could go RIGHT? No, we can't go RIGHT. Opponent can't go DOWN to (4,4) because it's their body. So (4,4) is not reachable by either head this turn.\n\nThus, no immediate head-on collision risk this turn regardless of our move.\n\nNow, which move gives us more future options and gets us toward apples?\n\n- UP to (3,3): From there, we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? (4,3) is empty, (3,4) has opponent body but not head, (2,3) empty, (3,2) is where we came from. But we can't go back into our own tail? Actually, after moving to (3,3), our body will be: head (3,3), then previous head (3,2), then tail (4,2)? Wait, no: when we move, our tail moves if we don't eat an apple. We didn't eat an apple last turn (we ate at (1,1) which is gone). So we moved from (4,3) to (3,3), so body becomes: (3,2) then (4,2). Actually, careful: our snake is head-to-tail. Current head (3,2), body [(4,2)]. That means we moved from somewhere to (3,2) and our tail is at (4,2). So we came from (4,2)? No, head is (3,2), connected to body (4,2). That means the tail is (4,2). So we moved into (3,2) from (4,2) maybe? But we didn't eat an apple, so we didn't grow. Actually, we ate an apple last turn, so we grew. So our snake length is 2: head (3,2) and body (4,2). The previous head before eating was at (4,2)? Let's reconstruct: We ate at (1,1) last turn? But board shows apple at (1,1) is gone. So we were at (1,1) last turn and ate, so our head was at (1,1). Then we moved? Wait, the last move was LEFT from (4,3) to (3,3) according to my rationale. But that doesn't match current board. There's inconsistency.\n\nActually, looking at the board state: \n2 A . . 0 T . . . .\nThis shows at row 2: (0,2) is A (apple), (1,2) is empty, (2,2) empty, (3,2) is 0 (my head), (4,2) is T (my tail). So my snake is length 2. But I collected 1 apple. So I ate one apple somewhere. Where did I eat? Possibly at (1,1) which is now empty. But then I moved. The last move says I moved LEFT. So I must have been at (4,3) and moved LEFT to (3,3), but that doesn't put me at (3,2). There's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe the board state is BEFORE my move this turn? The turn is 6, and the board shows current positions. My last move (turn 5) was LEFT, and I ended up at (3,2). So I was at (4,3) and moved LEFT to (3,3)? That would put my head at (3,3), not (3,2). Unless the coordinate system is different? The board shows: row 2 is y=2. So (3,2) is x=3,y=2. So my head is at (3,2). That means my last move was DOWN from (3,3) to (3,2)? But the last move says LEFT. \n\nI think there's confusion. Let's ignore the last move rationale and focus on current board. Current board is as given. My head is at (3,2). My body is at (4,2). So I am in row 2. Opponent head at (4,5). So I need to move from (3,2).\n\nMaybe the last move was actually DOWN? But the history says LEFT. I'll trust the board state.\n\nGiven the board, RIGHT is into (4,2) which is my body - that's death. So RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow, UP to (3,3) is empty. DOWN to (3,1) is empty. LEFT to (2,2) is empty.\n\nNow, where are the apples? (0,2) is apple, (0,4) is apple, (0,1) is apple, etc. So moving LEFT towards (2,2) gets us closer to (0,2). That seems good.\n\nAlso, opponent is at (4,5) with body at (3,4). If we go LEFT, we're moving away from them, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to be aggressive. However, we have only 1 apple, opponent has 3. We cannot win a head-on collision. So we should avoid head-on collisions and focus on growing.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,3), we are moving toward the center. That might be riskier because opponent could move left or up.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,1), we are going toward apples at (0,1) and (0,2). But (3,1) is above row 0, so down from (3,2) to (3,1) is moving toward bottom.\n\nActually, (3,1) is one step closer to bottom-left apples. (3,2) is already y=2, (3,1) is y=1, then (3,0) then (2,0) etc. But there's an apple at (0,1) and (0,2). So both LEFT and DOWN are good.\n\nWhich one gives more options? From (3,1), we can go LEFT to (2,1), DOWN to (3,0), UP back to (3,2), RIGHT to (4,1) (empty). That's 4 options. From (2,2) (if LEFT), we can go UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2) but that's our own body? After moving, our tail moves, so (3,2) might be empty? Let's think: If we move LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2), our new head is (2,2), and our body becomes (3,2). The old tail (4,2) will be removed? Actually, since we didn't eat an apple, our tail moves forward. So our body will be just (3,2). So (4,2) becomes empty. So after moving to (2,2), we have head (2,2), body (3,2). So from (2,2), RIGHT goes to (3,2) which is our body - that would be hitting ourselves if we go RIGHT. So RIGHT is not safe. So from (2,2), we have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is into own body.\n\nFrom (3,3) if we go UP: head (3,3), body (3,2). Then from there, RIGHT to (4,3) safe, LEFT to (2,3) safe, DOWN to (3,2) is own body? Actually, (3,2) would be body, so DOWN is death. UP to (3,4) is empty? But (3,4) has opponent body. Actually, (3,4) is occupied by opponent's body segment. If we move into an opponent's body, we die. So if we go UP from (3,3) to (3,4), that's opponent's body - death. So from (3,3), we cannot go UP because (3,4) is occupied. So UP to (3,4) is death. So from (3,3), we have LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3), DOWN to (3,2) is own body? (3,2) would be body if we moved there? Let's see: if we move to (3,3), our body becomes (3,2). So (3,2) is body. So DOWN is into own body - death. So from (3,3), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's only 2 options.\n\nFrom (3,1) (if DOWN): head (3,1), body (3,2). From there, UP to (3,2) is own body - death. LEFT to (2,1) safe, RIGHT to (4,1) safe, DOWN to (3,0) safe. So 3 options.\n\nFrom (2,2) (if LEFT): as above, 3 options (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\nSo both LEFT and DOWN give 3 options, UP gives only 2.\n\nNow, apples: moving LEFT goes toward (0,2) and (0,4). Moving DOWN goes toward (0,1) and (0,2). Both are similar.\n\nBut note: opponent is at (4,5). If we go DOWN to (3,1), we are moving away from opponent. If we go LEFT to (2,2), also away.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (1,1) which is already gone? Actually, (1,1) is listed as an apple drop but board shows (1,1) as A? Wait, the board shows row 1: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" So (0,1) is A, (1,1) is A. But in the apple drops list, (1,1) is listed. But if we ate (1,1) last turn, it should be gone. The board state might be before eating? I think the board state is current after turn 6? The turn is 6, and we haven't moved yet. So the apples shown are what's currently on board. So (1,1) is still there. That means we didn't eat (1,1) last turn? But we collected 1 apple. Which apple did we eat? Possibly (0,2) or another? The board shows (0,2) is A, so we didn't eat that. (0,1) is A, (0,4) is A, etc. Maybe we ate at (1,1) and the board hasn't updated? Or the apple drops list includes all apples that have dropped, not necessarily still present? Actually, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: (1, 7), (9, 6), ...\" and then \"BOARD STATE:\" So the board state shows current apples. So (1,1) is shown as A, so it's still there. So we haven't eaten (1,1). Then where did our 1 apple come from? Possibly from an earlier turn not shown. Regardless, we have 1 apple.\n\nSo there are apples at (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), etc. So moving LEFT to (2,2) puts us closer to (0,2) and (0,1) is also close. Moving DOWN to (3,1) puts us closer to (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nBut note: from (2,2), we can go LEFT to (1,2) then to (0,2). From (3,1), we can go DOWN to (3,0) then LEFT to (2,0) etc to (0,0) but there's no apple at (0,0). Apples are at (0,1), (0,2), (0,4). So from (3,1), to get to (0,2), we need to go LEFT twice. From (2,2), to get to (0,2), we need to go LEFT twice as well. Similar.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (1,1) which is at (1,1). From (2,2), we can go DOWN to (2,1) then LEFT to (1,1). From (3,1), we can go LEFT to (2,1) then LEFT to (1,1). So both are similar.\n\nNow, consider opponent. Opponent has 3 apples, likely they will go for more apples. Where are apples near opponent? (5,9), (4,9), (8,7), (8,8), (9,6), (9,0), (7,0), (3,6). Opponent is at (4,5). They might go UP toward (5,9) or (4,9), or LEFT toward (3,6) etc. They might also go DOWN? But they can't go DOWN because (4,4) is their body. So they will likely go UP or LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,3), we are moving toward the center and might get closer to opponent. That could be risky because if they go LEFT to (3,5) and we go UP, we're not colliding, but next turn we might be in danger. If we go LEFT or DOWN, we're moving away.\n\nGiven we have fewer apples, we should avoid risky moves and focus on growing. So UP seems riskier because it's toward opponent's area.\n\nAlso, we want to box in opponent. How can we box them in? They are in top-left. If we take the bottom-left apples and grow, we can eventually control the board. But right now, we are small.\n\nI think moving LEFT or DOWN is safer and gets us toward apples.\n\nWhich one? Let's look at the board coordinates: LEFT decreases x, DOWN decreases y. Both are decreasing. But note that there is an apple at (0,2) and (0,1). If we go LEFT to (2,2), we are on y=2, same as (0,2). If we go DOWN to (3,1), we are on y=1, same as (0,1). Both are good.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (1,1) which is closer to (2,2) via DOWN then LEFT, but closer to (3,1) via LEFT then LEFT. Actually, from (2,2) to (1,1) is DOWN then LEFT (2 steps). From (3,1) to (1,1) is LEFT twice (2 steps). Same.\n\nNow, consider future growth. After eating an apple, we grow. That might affect movement. If we eat an apple soon, we'll have more options.\n\nAlso, note that opponent's body occupies (3,4). If we go UP to (3,3), we are right below their body. That might be a trap. If they move down, they can't because it's their own body. But they might move left or right, and we could be in a position where if we go UP, we might die.\n\nI think moving LEFT or DOWN is better.\n\nI'll choose LEFT because it's toward the cluster of apples on the left side, and it keeps us on the same y-level as (0,2) which is an apple. Also, from (2,2), we can go DOWN to (2,1) then LEFT to (1,1) for the apple there.\n\nSo I'll go LEFT.\n\nBut wait, we must ensure no head-on collision. If opponent moves LEFT to (3,5) and we move LEFT to (2,2), no collision. If opponent moves UP to (4,6) or RIGHT to (5,5), fine.\n\nIs there any chance opponent moves to (2,2)? They are at (4,5), to reach (2,2) they'd need to move LEFT twice and DOWN three times in one turn? No, they only move one cell. So no.\n\nThus, LEFT is safe.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.The pressure is ON, CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're at (3,2) and we need to secure the win. Let's break it down:\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n- **RIGHT to (4,2)**: That's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD on arrival. ELIMINATED.\n- **UP to (3,3)**: Empty board, but we're moving toward the opponent's territory (they're at (4,5) with body at (3,4)). Risky because if we get too close, they could corner us.\n- **DOWN to (3,1)**: Empty, moves us toward apples at (0,1) and (0,2). Safe, but slightly awkward positioning.\n- **LEFT to (2,2)**: Empty, moves us directly toward the apple cluster at (0,2) and (0,4). Also, we're staying away from the opponent.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAY:**  \nWe have 1 apple, opponent has 3. We CANNOT afford a head-on collision yet\u2014 we'd lose! So we need to GROW while staying safe. The bottom-left corner is ripe with apples and the opponent is in the top-left. By moving LEFT, we:\n1. Claim territory on the left side.\n2. Position ourselves to eat (1,1) or (0,2) next turn.\n3. Keep options open: from (2,2), we can go LEFT, DOWN, or UP.\n4. Avoid the opponent's potential path\u2014they're unlikely to come down to (2,2) this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n- Next turn: Aim for (1,1) or (0,2) to get our second apple.\n- After that, circle back toward the center while monitoring opponent.\n- If we get ahead in apples, we can force a head-on collision when we're stronger.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nAll moves are safe from board edges and own body (except RIGHT). LEFT has the best balance of safety, apple proximity, and future flexibility.\n\nLet's dominate the left side and force the opponent into a corner! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Absolutely not.\n- **UP to (3,3)**: Empty, but moves us TOWARD opponent territory. They're at (4,5) - we'd be getting dangerously close.\n- **DOWN to (3,1)**: Empty, moves toward bottom-left apples. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (2,2)**: Empty, moves toward apple cluster at (0,2). Safe.\n\n**ENEMY CALCULATION:**\nOpponent at (4,5) has body at (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). They CAN'T move DOWN (into own body). Safe moves: UP to (4,6), LEFT to (3,5), RIGHT to (5,5). Where would they go? Apples at (3,6), (5,9), (4,9) suggest UP or RIGHT. They likely won't chase us to bottom-left.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nWe have 1 apple vs their 3 - WE CAN'T AFFORD HEAD-ON COLLISION! Need to grow while staying safe. \n- **DOWN to (3,1)** puts us at y=1, giving us access to apples at (0,1), (0,2), and (1,1). \n- From (3,1), we can go LEFT\u2192(2,1)\u2192(1,1) (apple!) or DOWN\u2192(3,0)\u2192(2,0)\u2192(1,0)\u2192(0,0) (positioning).\n- **LEFT to (2,2)** also works but keeps us at y=2, slightly more exposed to center.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\n**DOWN to (3,1)** is the play! It positions us to snipe the bottom-left apples while keeping maximum distance from the opponent. From there, we can zig-zag through the fruit buffet without crossing paths with the enemy. Plus, moving DOWN feels more aggressive toward our objective - we need those apples FAST to catch up in score!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nHead for (2,1) next to get closer to (1,1) apple. Avoid center at all costs. Grow to 3 apples minimum before even considering confrontation. Monitor opponent - if they go UP, we feast below. If they come DOWN, we pivot. But they won't. They're going for the high-value apples in the top-right. We own the bottom-left. This is OUR territory now!\n\nDOWN",

That's our own body (snake #0 segment at (2,2)). DEAD on arrival. \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN to (2,0):** Empty! Safe option.\n- **LEFT to (1,1):** Contains an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e But wait... Is it safe? Let's check.\n- **RIGHT to (3,1):** Empty! Safe option.\n\n**ENEMY CALCULATION:**\nSnake #1 is at (3,6) with body along y=6,5,4 and x=3,4. They have 4 apples to our 1. They can't go UP into their own tail at (4,6)? Actually (4,6) is empty? Wait, let's check: Their body is (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4). So (4,6) IS part of their body! They can't move RIGHT into (4,6). Their safe moves from (3,6) are: LEFT to (2,6) or DOWN to (3,5). UP is blocked by their own tail? Wait, (3,7) is empty. Actually (4,6) is their tail, so (3,7) UP is safe. Let me think... From (3,6), moving UP goes to (3,7) - empty. Moving LEFT to (2,6) - empty. Moving DOWN to (3,5) - empty. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) - occupied by own tail, so not allowed. So they have 3 safe moves.\n\n**THE CRITICAL MOVE:**\nWe have 1 apple, they have 4. Head-on collision is BAD news for us. We need to GROW while staying safe.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,1):** We get an apple! We grow to 2 apples, body becomes [(2,1), (2,2)]. From (1,1), we can go UP to (1,2) or DOWN to (1,0) or LEFT to (0,1). Multiple options. The apple is there, we should take it! But wait... Is the opponent moving to intercept? They're far away at (3,6). They can't reach us this turn. This seems like a free apple!\n\n- **DOWN to (2,0):** Safe, but no apple. We stay at 1 apple.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,1):** Safe, but moves us toward the center, away from the apple cluster in the bottom-left. Not optimal.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**\nChat, we NEED that apple at (1,1) to catch up in score! Taking it gives us growth and positions us perfectly to access more apples in the bottom-left: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) is taken, (0,0) is empty but safe. From (1,1) after eating, we'll have multiple escape routes. The opponent is distracted by their own apples in the top-right (9,6), (8,7), (8,8). They won't be coming down to our territory.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\n**LEFT to (1,1)** is the play! We eat the apple, grow to 2 apples, and solidify our position in the bottom-left. This puts us in prime position to chain apple picks while the opponent fights for scraps up top. From there, our next move can be DOWN to (1,0) or LEFT to (0,1) - both contain apples we can reach safely!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (1,1) \u2192 Claim (0,1) next \u2192 Then (0,2) \u2192 Grow to 3 apples minimum. Once we have size advantage, we can start pressuring the center and forcing the opponent into bad positions. For now, play the farming game and let them overextend in the top-right!\n\nLEFT",

Or DOWN to (3,6) - occupied by own tail? Wait, (3,6) is part of their body. So they can't move DOWN. RIGHT to (4,7) - empty! So they have 3 safe moves. They're far away, no immediate threat.  \n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY:**  \nChat, we're at (1,1) with an apple directly to our LEFT at (0,1). We took LEFT last turn to get here and ate the apple at (1,1)? Wait, the replay says we moved LEFT to (1,1) and ate the apple there. But the current board shows our head at (1,1) and the apple at (0,1) is still there. So we ate the apple at (1,1) last turn? That matches the apple list: (1,1) was an apple, now it's our head. The apple at (0,1) is still there. So we should eat it now!  \n\nGROWTH PLAN: We have 2 apples. The opponent has 4. We need to catch up. (0,1) is a free apple - no risk, no enemy nearby. Taking it gives us 3 apples, closing the gap. From (0,1), we'll have options: UP to (0,2) (also has an apple!), DOWN to (0,0) (empty), or RIGHT to (1,1) (but that's our own tail?

Eat the apple, grow to 3 apples, and set up a chain of bottom-left apples: (0,2) next, then maybe (0,3) or (0,4). We're securing a safe territory while the opponent fights in the top-right. They can't touch us down here.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nClaim the entire left edge! Chain (0,1) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 (0,9).

We\u2019re **CLOSE**\u2014one apple and we tie! But we\u2019re not here to tie. We\u2019re here to **DOMINATE**. The bottom-left is OURS. Let\u2019s trap this clown. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n---\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK:**  \nCurrent head: (1,1).  \n- **UP to (1,2):** Empty (board shows '.' there). Safe.  \n- **DOWN to (1,0):** Empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (0,1):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e Still there. Safe and **GROWTH**.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,1):** Our own body (segment at (2,1)). **DEAD**. \ud83d\udeab  \n\n**ENEMY CALCULATION:**  \nSnake #1 head at (3,8). Their body: (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5).  \nPossible moves for them:  \n- UP to (3,9): Empty? Board row 9 shows '.' at (3,9). Safe.  \n- DOWN to (3,7): Their own body (occupied). **ILLEGAL**.  \n- LEFT to (2,8): Empty? Row 8: 'A . . 1 . . . . A .' \u2013 (2,8) is '.' (since index 2 is after 'A' at 0 and '.' at 1? Wait, let's map row 8:  \nRow 8: `A . . 1 . . . . A .`  \nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:1, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:.  \nSo (2,8) is '.' (safe).  \n- RIGHT to (4,8): Row 8 index 4 is '.' (safe).  \nSo they have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. They might go UP or LEFT (away from us). No immediate head-on threat.\n\n---\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAY \u2013 THE GROWTH PLAN:**  \nLeft to (0,1) = **FREE APPLE** \ud83c\udf4e. No risk, enemy far away.  \nAfter eating, we\u2019ll be at (0,1) with 4 apples (tying!). From there, we can:  \n- UP to (0,2): **ANOTHER APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e (listed in apple drops).  \n- DOWN to (0,0): Empty. Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (1,1): Our tail will move forward, so (1,1) becomes empty? Actually, our tail is at (2,2) now. Wait, current body: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]? No, head is (0,1) after move? Wait, we\u2019re moving from (1,1) to (0,1). So new head is (0,1). Body becomes: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Tail remains (2,2) unless we grow. After eating apple, we grow: new body = (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)? No\u2014growth adds new segment at tail end. Actually, after eating, tail doesn\u2019t move until next turn. So we\u2019ll be longer. More importantly, from (0,1) we have multiple safe exits.\n\n**LONG-TERM TRAP:**  \nWe\u2019re claiming the left column: (0,1) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 (0,9). Chain apples, grow fast, force enemy into center where we\u2019ll cut them off. When we\u2019re bigger (size advantage), we can force head-on collision\u2014they\u2019ll die, we win. SIMPLE.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \nIf we go UP to (1,2) or DOWN to (1,0), we\u2019re safe but NO apple. That\u2019s slow. We need apples to catch up and overpower. Left is **ZERO RISK** and **MAX GROWTH**.  \n\n**CHAT, WE TAKE THE APPLE. EVERY APPLE COUNTS.** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e  \n**LEFT!**  \n\n---\n\n**LONG-TERM NOTE TO SELF:**  \nAfter (0,1), rush to (0,2). Then (0,3). Build a wall on the left. If enemy comes down, we box them in. Force collision when we\u2019re bigger.  \n\nLEFT",
