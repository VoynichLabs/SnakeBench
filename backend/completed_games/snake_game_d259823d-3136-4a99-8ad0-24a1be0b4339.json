It keeps me on the edge but gives more maneuverability\n2. It maintains distance from the enemy\n3. It keeps multiple future options open\n4. It positions me better for future apple targets\n5. It avoids cornering myself\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Continue moving along the top edge to maintain safety\n- Monitor the (2,1) apple and consider moving toward it if the enemy doesn't\n- Avoid the right side where the enemy is stronger\n- Keep multiple escape routes to avoid getting trapped\n- Prioritize safety over immediate apple collection\n- Be prepared to change direction if the enemy moves aggressively\n- Consider that the enemy might try to intercept if I move toward (2,1)\n- Maintain focus on maintaining board position and safety\n\nRIGHT",

UP: (6,7) - empty (safe)\n2. DOWN: (6,5) - empty (safe)\n3. LEFT: (5,6) - empty (safe)\n4. RIGHT: (7,6) - my body (unsafe)\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\nEnemy's possible moves from (3,5):\n1. UP: (3,6) - empty (safe)\n2. DOWN: (3,4) - their body (unsafe)\n3. LEFT: (2,5) - empty (safe)\n4. RIGHT: (4,5) - empty (safe)\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT\n\nAnalysis:\n- The (4,7) apple is now directly reachable by moving UP to (6,7)\n- The enemy snake is now longer (length 16) and has more apples (16 vs my 11)\n- The enemy's head is at (3,5) with several safe moves available\n- My safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT\n- UP to (6,7) would put me one move away from the (4,7) apple\n  * From (6,7), my next moves would be:\n    - UP: (6,8) - my body (unsafe)\n    - DOWN: (6,6) - my current head (safe)\n    - LEFT: (5,7) - empty (safe)\n    - RIGHT: (7,7) - my body (unsafe)\n  * This gives me two safe follow-up moves (DOWN and LEFT)\n- DOWN to (6,5) moves me toward the center but away from apples\n  * From (6,5), my next moves would be:\n    - UP: (6,6) - my current head (safe)\n    - DOWN: (6,4) - empty (safe)\n    - LEFT: (5,5) - enemy body (unsafe)\n    - RIGHT: (7,5) - enemy body (unsafe)\n  * This gives me two safe follow-up moves (UP and DOWN), but both LEFT and RIGHT are blocked by enemy\n- LEFT to (5,6) moves me toward the center and away from apples\n  * From (5,6), my next moves would be:\n    - UP: (5,7) - empty (safe)\n    - DOWN: (5,5) - enemy body (unsafe)\n    - LEFT: (4,6) - empty (safe)\n    - RIGHT: (6,6) - my current head (safe)\n  * This gives me three safe follow-up moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- The (4,7) apple is the most immediate target and can be collected next turn if I move UP now\n- The enemy is likely to move toward the center or toward the (6,2) apple\n- Moving UP gives me the best chance to collect an apple soon while maintaining reasonable follow-up options\n- After collecting the (4,7) apple, I can reassess and potentially move toward other apples or maintain distance from the enemy\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move UP to (6,7) to approach the (4,7) apple\n- Next turn, move LEFT to (5,7) to collect the (4,7) apple\n- After collecting the apple, reassess the board state\n- Consider moving toward the (9,3) apple if the path is clear\n- Maintain distance from the enemy snake which is longer and more dangerous\n- Keep multiple safe follow-up moves available at all times\n- Avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or near the enemy's body\n- Monitor the enemy's movement and adjust my path accordingly\n\nUP",
