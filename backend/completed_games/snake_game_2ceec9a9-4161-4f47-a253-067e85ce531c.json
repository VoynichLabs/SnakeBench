My primary goal now is to navigate toward the closest apples efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n\n- The apple at (7,0) is directly below and close in vertical distance, but there's a significant gap in between, and the path downward toward (7,0) is unobstructed.\n- The apple at (6,4) is above and to the left of current position, requiring moving up and then left, which may be longer.\n- The apple at (4,0) is further left and down, requiring moving left and down.\n- The apple at (2,3) is to the left and slightly down, but farther in total distance.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving down again seems problematic because I am at (8,8) now, and moving down would go to (8,7), which is empty and safe. From (8,8), moving down takes me to (8,7), which is free.\n\nHowever, I also need to think ahead towards the apple at (7,0). Moving down now keeps me away from apples at the bottom, so perhaps moving left would be better to approach (7,0) in upcoming moves because moving left from (8,8) will get me toward (7,8), then further down toward (7,0).\n\nBut moving left from (8,8) to (7,8) is possible, and then further down to (7,0). Alternatively, moving down first places me closer vertically, then moving left to reach (7,0) eventually.\n\nAnother concern is the location of the enemy snake at (6,5). If I plan to go left, I should avoid the spot at (6,5) to prevent colliding with it.\n\nConsidering all, moving left from (8,8) to (7,8) seems logical to approach (7,0), but moving down might be better for advancing toward (7,0) directly in subsequent moves.\n\nGiven that, I decide to continue moving down to get closer to the bottom apples, particularly (7,0), and then plan to navigate left afterward.\n\nNext move: DOWN.",

My primary goal now is to navigate toward the closest apples efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n\n- The apple at (7,0) is directly below and close in vertical distance, but there's a significant gap in between, and the path downward toward (7,0) is unobstructed.\n- The apple at (6,4) is above and to the left of current position, requiring moving up and then left, which may be longer.\n- The apple at (4,0) is further left and down, requiring moving left and down.\n- The apple at (2,3) is to the left and slightly down, but farther in total distance.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving down again seems problematic because I am at (8,8) now, and moving down would go to (8,7), which is empty and safe.

The last move info indicates I was at (8, 1) before moving UP, so now I'm at (8, 8) after the move.\n\n- Moving onto the apple at (8, 8) would give me a point and cause the snake to grow.

Since my move was already UP last turn, I need to decide whether to proceed with moving UP again or consider alternative directions to avoid risks.\n\n- The surrounding area:\n  - Upwards: Moving beyond (8, 8) is impossible \u2014 it\u2019s the top edge.\n  - Downward: Moving back down might be risky unless I want to avoid a potential trap.\n  - Left or right: To explore options or set up for future moves.\n\n- Since the apple at (8, 8) is directly reachable and I have no obstacles in the immediate path, continuing UP seems safe and optimal to obtain this apple.\n\n- No immediate threats or enemy snake conflicts are visible along the path.\n\nNext step: To guarantee I reach the apple, I should continue moving UP for this turn.\n\nHowever, considering the last move info, I think I\u2019m already at (8, 8), having just consumed the apple, or I plan to do so next move. The last move was UP from (8,1) to (8,8), so now I\u2019m at (8,8). If that\u2019s the case, I should now look to keep the snake safe and plan my next move accordingly.\n\nSince I just reached (8, 8), I have the following options:\n- Move down to avoid being at the top edge if I\u2019m planning to grow longer.\n- Move in another direction to pursue the next target.\n\nGiven the current goals, the best move is to move RIGHT or LEFT to continue extending the snake safely, or DOWN to avoid trapping at the top edge.\n\nLooking at the surroundings:\n- Right: (9,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Left: (7,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Down: (8,7) is empty.\n\nTo stay safe, I could go RIGHT or LEFT.

The enemy is relatively far from my current position.\n- Moving left to (7,8) seems safe; the space is free, and it aligns me towards the target apple at (7,0).\n- Moving up to (8,9) is safe but may not be strategic immediately.\n- Moving down to (8,7) is safe and gets me closer vertically.\n\nGiven the goal to approach the apple at (7,0), and the safety of moving left from my current position, **moving left** seems like a good choice.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

My primary goal now is to navigate toward the closest apples efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n\n- The apple at (7,0) is directly below and close in vertical distance, but there's a significant gap in between, and the path downward toward (7,0) is unobstructed.\n- The apple at (6,4) is above and to the left of current position, requiring moving up and then left, which may be longer.\n- The apple at (4,0) is further left and down, requiring moving left and down.\n- The apple at (2,3) is to the left and slightly down, but farther in total distance.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving down again seems problematic because I am at (8,8) now, and moving down would go to (8,7), which is empty and safe. From (8,8), moving down takes me to (8,7), which is free.\n\nHowever, I also need to think ahead towards the apple at (7,0).

Since my move was already UP last turn, I need to decide whether to proceed with moving UP again or consider alternative directions to avoid risks.\n\n- The surrounding area:\n  - Upwards: Moving beyond (8, 8) is impossible \u2014 it\u2019s the top edge.\n  - Downward: Moving back down might be risky unless I want to avoid a potential trap.\n  - Left or right: To explore options or set up for future moves.\n\n- Since the apple at (8, 8) is directly reachable and I have no obstacles in the immediate path, continuing UP seems safe and optimal to obtain this apple.\n\n- No immediate threats or enemy snake conflicts are visible along the path.\n\nNext step: To guarantee I reach the apple, I should continue moving UP for this turn.\n\nHowever, considering the last move info, I think I\u2019m already at (8, 8), having just consumed the apple, or I plan to do so next move. The last move was UP from (8,1) to (8,8), so now I\u2019m at (8,8). If that\u2019s the case, I should now look to keep the snake safe and plan my next move accordingly.\n\nSince I just reached (8, 8), I have the following options:\n- Move down to avoid being at the top edge if I\u2019m planning to grow longer.\n- Move in another direction to pursue the next target.\n\nGiven the current goals, the best move is to move RIGHT or LEFT to continue extending the snake safely, or DOWN to avoid trapping at the top edge.\n\nLooking at the surroundings:\n- Right: (9,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Left: (7,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Down: (8,7) is empty.\n\nTo stay safe, I could go RIGHT or LEFT.

Since my move was already UP last turn, I need to decide whether to proceed with moving UP again or consider alternative directions to avoid risks.\n\n- The surrounding area:\n  - Upwards: Moving beyond (8, 8) is impossible \u2014 it\u2019s the top edge.\n  - Downward: Moving back down might be risky unless I want to avoid a potential trap.\n  - Left or right: To explore options or set up for future moves.\n\n- Since the apple at (8, 8) is directly reachable and I have no obstacles in the immediate path, continuing UP seems safe and optimal to obtain this apple.\n\n- No immediate threats or enemy snake conflicts are visible along the path.\n\nNext step: To guarantee I reach the apple, I should continue moving UP for this turn.\n\nHowever, considering the last move info, I think I\u2019m already at (8, 8), having just consumed the apple, or I plan to do so next move. The last move was UP from (8,1) to (8,8), so now I\u2019m at (8,8). If that\u2019s the case, I should now look to keep the snake safe and plan my next move accordingly.\n\nSince I just reached (8, 8), I have the following options:\n- Move down to avoid being at the top edge if I\u2019m planning to grow longer.\n- Move in another direction to pursue the next target.\n\nGiven the current goals, the best move is to move RIGHT or LEFT to continue extending the snake safely, or DOWN to avoid trapping at the top edge.\n\nLooking at the surroundings:\n- Right: (9,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Left: (7,8) is empty, no obstacle.\n- Down: (8,7) is empty.\n\nTo stay safe, I could go RIGHT or LEFT. Choosing RIGHT would move toward uncharted territory and possibly place me near other apples or strategic locations.\n\nNext turn, I will move RIGHT to explore further safely.\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**",

My primary goal now is to navigate toward the closest apples efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n\n- The apple at (7,0) is directly below and close in vertical distance, but there's a significant gap in between, and the path downward toward (7,0) is unobstructed.\n- The apple at (6,4) is above and to the left of current position, requiring moving up and then left, which may be longer.\n- The apple at (4,0) is further left and down, requiring moving left and down.\n- The apple at (2,3) is to the left and slightly down, but farther in total distance.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving down again seems problematic because I am at (8,8) now, and moving down would go to (8,7), which is empty and safe.
