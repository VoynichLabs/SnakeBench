We\u2019re 10x10, plenty of space, but we need to start claiming territory NOW! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's look at the options for our first move:\n- **UP** to (9, 3): Takes us closer to the apple at (8, 3) and keeps us along the wall. I like the wall, it limits where they can come at us from!\n- **DOWN** to (9, 1): Puts us near the apples at (7, 1) and (8, 3).\n- **LEFT** to (8, 2): Puts us right next to an apple drop at (8, 3).\n- **RIGHT**: NOPE! We'd walk right off the board at x=10. We aren't throwing the game in the first ten seconds! Absolute scrub move!\n\nRival check: Snake #1 is at (2, 6). They are miles away! Can they even touch us? Not yet! But they have apples at (0, 6) and (2, 4) in their sights. We need to grow, we need to get big, and we need to eventually cut off their pathing to the center. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSince we are at (9, 2), if we move UP, we are perfectly positioned to snag the apple at (8, 3) or (7, 5) later. We want to dominate the right side and then sweep across like a boss. Let's start the climb! Can they handle the pressure? I don't think so! Let's get that height advantage!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** I'm going to head north along the 9-column or 8-column to secure the top-right quadrant. Once I have a few apples and some length, I'll start looping back toward the center to box them into the left side. Stay aggressive, stay fast!\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT toward (3, 6) keeps us flexible and allows us to react to their next move.\n- Moving UP or LEFT could box us in or limit our future options. DOWN is risky if the enemy moves up.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Keep moving toward the center to dominate the board.\n- Force the enemy into a corner or a position where they have fewer safe moves.\n- If we get a chance for a head-on collision when we have a higher score, we'll take it!\n\n### Final Move:\nLet's go RIGHT to control the center and keep our options open!\n\nRIGHT",

We are big, we are fast, and we are coming for that trophy! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's look at the map, chat. This is where we separate the pros from the casuals!\n- **Current Position:** Head at (8, 3), body trailing at (9, 3).\n- **UP to (8, 4):** This is a solid play. It keeps us flexible and moves us toward that cluster of apples in the upper-right like (7, 5) or (8, 8).\n- **DOWN to (8, 2):** Why go down? The apple at (7, 1) is there, but moving down might tuck us into a corner too early. We want the center stage!\n- **LEFT to (7, 3):** This gets us closer to our rival, Snake #1, who is currently at (4, 6). If we move left, we start closing the gap to box them in.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 3):** STOP! That's our own body! We aren't trying to eat ourselves on Turn 2! Chat, don't let me do it! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**RIVAL WATCH:** Snake #1 is at (4, 6). They have 0 apples. They are desperate. They\u2019re probably looking at (2, 4) or (5, 2). If we move UP, we maintain a height advantage. If we move LEFT, we start the squeeze.\n\n**THE PLAY:** We are going **UP** to (8, 4). Why? Because it positions us perfectly to intercept them if they try to cross to the right side of the board. We stay near the wall for safety but keep our head pointed toward the juicy targets at (7, 5) and (4, 7). We are growing, we are watching, and we are ready to punish any mistake they make. Let's build this lead and make them crash out under the pressure! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We've got the length, we've got the lead, and Snake #1 is looking absolutely LOST out there! They don't have a body yet, just a head floating at (5, 6), while we are solid at (8, 4) with our tail at (8, 3). \n\nLet's break down the board, because we are playing 4D chess while this guy is playing checkers!\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (8, 4)\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 6)\n- **The Gap:** We are currently 3 units right and 2 units down from them. \n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (8, 5):** This is a high-IQ play. We stay on the right flank, mirroring their height. There\u2019s an apple at (7, 5) just waiting to be snatched. If we go UP, we position ourselves to either grab that or cut them off if they try to dash for the (8, 8) apple.\n- **DOWN to (8, 3):** BAD CHAT! STOP! That\u2019s our own tail! We aren't about to self-destruct on Turn 3 and become a fail compilation! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT to (7, 4):** This is the aggressive \"In-Your-Face\" move. We close the distance to the enemy and move toward the apple at (2, 4) or (5, 2). It puts us on a collision course. Since we have a higher score (1 vs 0), a head-on collision at the same cell means a double KO, but the rules say the one with more apples at the moment of death WINS. We are the King of the Hill right now! \ud83d\udc51\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Too passive. We'd be hugging the wall like a coward. We don't play for 2nd place!\n\n**STRATEGY:** \nRival #1 is likely going for (7, 5) or (4, 7). If we move **LEFT**, we are moving into the center of the map to contest the space. We want to dominate the mid-board. By moving LEFT to (7, 4), we are only two steps away from that (7, 5) apple while cutting off the rival's path to the right side of the board. If they try to sneak past us, we'll be right there to box them into the corner! We are playing big, we are playing fast! Let\u2019s show them why they call us the GOAT of Snake! \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** \nSnag (7, 5) if the rival doesn't contest, then pivot UP or LEFT to keep them pinned in the top-left quadrant. Keep the score lead at all costs so we win any head-on trades!\n\nLEFT",

WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GIGA-BRAINING THIS GAME! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25 We just snagged that apple at (7, 5), and now we are a thick 3-length unit while Snake #1 is still just a lonely little head! Look at the scoreboard: 2-0! We are doubling their score! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Head:** (7, 5)\n- **Our Body:** [(7, 4), (8, 4)] \u2014 We\u2019re forming a nice \"L\" shape.\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 6). THEY ARE LITERALLY BLOCKED FROM MOVING DOWN! If they move DOWN, they crash into our head and die! \ud83d\uded1\ud83e\udd21\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (7, 6):** YO! This is the aggression Chat loves! If we move UP and they stay still (wait, they have to move!) or move to (7, 6), it\u2019s a head-on collision. Since we have more apples (2 vs 0), we win the game right there! BUT, if they move LEFT or RIGHT, we might miss.\n- **LEFT to (6, 5):** This is a solid reposition. It keeps us in the mix and sets us up to pressure the middle of the board.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 5):** This is safe growth territory! Look at the apple at (8, 8). We can start pivoting that way.\n- **DOWN to (7, 4):** NO NO NO! That\u2019s our own body! We aren't throwing for the highlights! \u274c\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 6). They have apples at (6, 7) and (4, 7) to their left, and (8, 8) to their right. They are feeling the pressure! If we move **LEFT**, we are basically building a wall. We are cutting off their path to the western apples. We want to shepherd them into the corners or force them to make a mistake.\n\nWait, look at (7, 6). If we move UP, we are challenging them for their space. But if we move **LEFT** to (6, 5), we are playing the long game. We stay flexible, we stay dangerous, and we keep our body between them and the juicy (4, 7) (3, 5) apple cluster! Let's keep the pressure high but play it smart. We want to stay parallel to them and then CUT THEM OFF!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT CLIPS:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 5). This positions us to snag the (3, 5) apple or shadow them if they try to go for (6, 7). We are the kings of this 10x10 jungle! Keep them dancing to our beat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd7a\n\nLEFT",

Body segments at (7, 5) and (7, 4). We are thick and healthy!\n- **The Enemy (Snake 1):** Head at (8, 6). They are still just a size 1 snake! No body, no backup, no hope! \ud83e\udd21\n- **The Battlefield:** We just moved LEFT to (6, 5). We are currently chilling in the middle-right of the board.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (6, 6):** This is a power move! It puts us directly adjacent to the enemy's potential movement. If we move UP and they move LEFT to (7, 6), we are breathing down their neck!\n- **DOWN to (6, 4):** A bit passive, Chat. We don't want to play it too safe when we have the advantage. \ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT to (5, 5):** This is the \"Apple Hunter\" play. We've got apples at (3, 5), (5, 2), and (5, 1) all calling our name. It also keeps us away from the enemy's potential desperation lunges.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 5):** NO! That's our own body! We aren't here to donate points! \u274c\n\n**THE GIGA-BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). They have apples at (8, 8) and (6, 7). They are likely going to try and scramble for growth. If we move **UP** to (6, 6), we are positioning ourselves to intercept them at (6, 7) or shadow them if they try to head for the top-right corner. \n\nBUT WAIT! Look at the board! If we move **UP**, and they move **LEFT** to (7, 6), and then the turn after that they move **LEFT** again to (6, 6) while we are there... that's a collision! Since we have 2 apples and they have 0, if we collide heads at (6, 6) NEXT turn, we win the game on the spot! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's maintain the pressure. We move UP to (6, 6). We are cutting off the center, shadowing their move toward the (6, 7) apple, and preparing to box them into the top-right corner where they will have nowhere to go but into our massive body or the wall!

We just hit 3 apples and we are looking ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE compared to that tiny little dot across the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51 Snake #1 is still sitting at zero\u2014literally a single pixel of sadness at (9, 7). They are probably shaking right now! \ud83d\udcc9\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **Our Squad (ID 0):** Head at (6, 7). Body trailing at (6, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5). We are long, we are strong, and we are in control!\n- **The Opposition (Snake 1):** Head at (9, 7). No body. Just a floating head. \ud83e\udd21 \n- **The Apple Situation:** There's an apple at (5, 8) and (8, 8). We are literally right there!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **DOWN to (6, 6):** THAT'S OUR OWN BODY, CHAT! We aren't trying to end the stream early! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe, but it's moving us back toward the center. We want to maintain pressure!\n- **RIGHT to (7, 7):** This brings us closer to Snake #1. Since we have 3 apples and they have 0, if we can force a head-on collision, WE WIN the tie-break! But they are at (9, 7), so moving to (7, 7) puts us two units away.\n- **UP to (6, 8):** This is the GIGA-BRAIN move! Look at the board! There are apples at (5, 8), (4, 8), and (8, 8). Moving UP puts us in the driver's seat to claim the entire top row!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is at (9, 7). If they move UP, they go to (9, 8). If we move UP to (6, 8), we are essentially mirroring them but with a massive body advantage. We are going to head UP, set ourselves up to grab more fruit, and keep our body as a literal wall between them and the rest of the board! If they try to cross the middle, they have to deal with our length! We're playing for total board dominance here. Let's go grab that next apple and get to size 5! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. \n- **The Wannabe (Snake 1):** Head at (9, 8). No body. They are trapped between us and the wall!\n- **Scoreboard:** We have 4 apples, they have 0. We are significantly longer and have the score lead!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **RIGHT to (9, 8):** NO! That's moving directly into the enemy's current head position. While we'd win the score tie-break if we both died, why throw our life away when we can just dominate them?\n- **LEFT to (7, 8):** HOLD UP! That\u2019s our own body! Chat, we are NOT throwing for the \"Fail\" compilation today! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (8, 7):** This is safe! It opens up the board and keeps us mobile while we wait for them to make a mistake.\n- **UP to (8, 9):** YO! Look at the geometry! If we move UP to (8, 9), we are effectively creating a wall. If they move LEFT to (8, 8) at the same time, we collide. Since we have 4 apples and they have 0, **WE WIN THE GAME ON THE SPOT!** \ud83c\udfc6 If they try to move UP to (9, 9), they are just delaying the inevitable. If they move DOWN to (9, 7), we've still got them cornered.\n\n**THE GIGA-BRAIN PLAY:**\nWe are going UP to (8, 9). This move is pure pressure! We are forcing them to either crash into us, crash into the wall, or retreat into a tighter space. We have the mass, we have the score, and we have the momentum. It\u2019s time to close the trap and end this stream with a massive W! Let's show them why we're the GOAT of the 10x10! \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nOccupy the (8, 9) square. If they survive this turn by moving UP to (9, 9) or DOWN to (9, 7), we will continue to shadow their movement and stay one step ahead. We will use our length to \"coil\" around the top right corner. They have no body to help them, while we have a 5-length shield! Keep the pressure, don't let them breath!\n\nUP",

Move UP to (9, 9): Still trapped.\n2. Move LEFT to (8, 8): They CRASH into our body and DIE instantly! \ud83d\udc80\n3. Move DOWN to (9, 7): They stay in the corner.\n\nWe are playing at the highest level! By moving Left, we open up the entire map to navigate back down to the massive apple clusters in the center and bottom. Snake #1 is irrelevant. They are a ghost! We are going to hit 30 apples while they are still trying to figure out how to move! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are moving LEFT to (6, 9) to secure our safety. Next turn, we continue moving LEFT toward (3, 9) or pivot DOWN to start vacuuming up the apples at (4, 8), (4, 7), and (5, 5). We will use our length to wall off the entire upper-right quadrant, essentially putting Snake #1 in a permanent timeout. If they try to follow us, they have to swim through our tail. It's GG! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating the top lane like absolute KINGS! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51 Snake #1 is literally just a single pixel at (9, 9) while we have a massive 6-segment train rolling through! 5-0 lead? That's not a score, that's a statement!\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **THE KING (ID 0):** Head at (4, 9). Our body is stretching out behind us at (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), and (8, 8). We are healthy, we are long, and we are hungry!\n- **THE WANNABE (Snake 1):** Head at (9, 9). They are pinned in the top-right corner! They have NO body segments. They are just a lonely head looking for a way out. \ud83d\udc2d\n- **SCORE:** 5 to 0. We've got the insurance policy! Since we have more apples, if we ever collide head-on, WE WIN THE GAME instantly! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (4, 10):** That's off the board! We leave the trolling to the chat, not the gameplay! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (5, 9):** That's our own neck! We aren't here to self-destruct! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (4, 8):** Very strong move. There's an apple at (4, 8) right under us! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT to (3, 9):** ALSO extremely strong. There is an apple at (3, 9) waiting for us to gobble it up!\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWhy move **LEFT to (3, 9)**? Because it\u2019s about board control, baby! By taking (3, 9), we secure our 6th apple and continue our path toward the left side where even more apples are waiting at (0, 6) and (0, 3). \n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 9). Their only moves are LEFT to (8, 9) or DOWN to (9, 8). If they go LEFT, they are running straight into our tail! If they go DOWN, they are still miles away from the action. We are effectively zoning them into the corner while we feast. Once we grab (3, 9), we can then drop DOWN to (3, 8) and sweep across the map. We're building a horizontal wall that they can't cross without risking a head-on collision they'll lose! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nPick up the apple at (3, 9) this turn. Next, we look to pivot DOWN to start clearing out the middle of the board (4, 8), (4, 7), and (5, 5). We need to maintain our lead and use our length to \"coil\" the center. If Snake #1 tries to make a run for it, we intercept! We stay wide, we stay long, and we stay WINNING! Let's get that 6th apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re going to weave through the middle-left section to keep our body away from the walls, giving us maximum room to maneuver.

Snake #1 is literally just a head at (8, 7) trying to find relevance while we are a massive 8-segment UNIT dominating the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **THE CHAD (ID 0):** Head at (4, 8). Our body is trailing away: (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9). We are long, we are strong, and we are in control!\n- **THE TRASH (Snake 1):** Head at (8, 7). They have ZERO body segments. They are basically a fly at this point, chat! \ud83e\udeb0\n- **THE LAYOUT:** There's a juice apple right below us at (4, 7). Our rival is at (8, 7). They might try to move towards the center, but they are miles away from our throne!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (4, 9):** CHAT, NO! That's our own body!

We want that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN to (4, 7):** **BINGO!** \ud83c\udfaf There is an apple sitting right there at (4, 7). We move down, we eat, we grow to 8 points, and we keep the rival pinned to the right side of the board!\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe are going **DOWN to (4, 7)**. Why? Because we need to maintain our size advantage! If we have a higher score, we can force a head-on collision later and win the tie-break or just crush them with our length! Snake #1 is at (8, 7). Even if they move LEFT to (7, 7), we are still 3 spaces away. They can't touch the King! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (4, 7). After that, we look at the snacks at (5, 6) or (3, 5). We are going to loop around the middle of the board, creating a wall that Snake #1 can't cross. We're going to box them into that right wall and watch them crash out! Stay hungry, stay dangerous! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc8e\n\nDOWN",

They are basically a speck of dust on our windshield! \ud83e\uddf9\n- **THE MAP:** We have apples at (5, 6), (4, 5), and (3, 5) just waiting for the King to claim them.\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (4, 8):** NOPE!

However, why risk a draw when we can just win by total domination? \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN to (4, 6):** **THE PLAY!** \ud83c\udfaf This positions us perfectly to snag the apple at (5, 6) or (4, 5) on the next turn. More importantly, it maintains our vertical wall. If we move down, we start cutting off the middle of the board!\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe are going **DOWN to (4, 6)**. Chat, look at the geometry! By moving down, we are staying central and keeping Snake #1 pinned against that right wall. They have no body, so they have to move every turn to stay alive. We are going to gobble up the apples at (5, 6) and (4, 5), increasing our lead to 10-0. At that point, we just coil around the center and it's GG! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (5, 6) then (4, 5). Use our massive length to create a \"No-Fly Zone\" in the center-right of the board. If the rival tries to sneak past us to the left, we'll be there to cut them off. We are playing for the 30-apple win or the total wipeout! Stay focused, stay toxic, stay winning! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

We are absolutely COOKING! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udd25 We are sitting pretty with 8 apples, and Snake #1 is still a tiny little head at (6, 7) with a big fat ZERO! He's basically a fly buzzing around a dragon right now! \ud83d\udc09\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **THE GOLIATH (ID 0):** Our head is at (4, 6). Our massive tail is curling around the top at (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9). We are a literal fortress!\n- **THE NOOB (Snake 1):** Head at (6, 7). He has no body, but he's hovering right near us. He's looking for a cheeky head-on collision to force a draw, but we\u2019re too smart for that!\n- **THE LOOT:** Look at the board! We have apples at (5, 6) right next to us, (4, 5) just below, and (3, 5) to the left of that. This is a buffet! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (4, 7):** NO WAY! That\u2019s our own body. Chat, we are NOT throwing for the memes! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6):** There is an apple there, BUT that puts us at (5, 6). If Snake #1 moves LEFT, we hit him head-on at (5, 7) or (5, 6) depending on timing. Wait, they move simultaneously! If he moves LEFT and I move RIGHT, we are in adjacent squares. If he moves DOWN and I move RIGHT, we are close. But check this: if I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we crash! Given we have the 8-0 lead, a double KO is an automatic WIN for us, but I want to humiliate him first! \ud83d\ude08\n- **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe, but it's moving away from the juicy apples. \n- **DOWN to (4, 5):** **THE BIG BRAIN PLAY!** \ud83c\udfaf This secures the apple at (4, 5) immediately! It keeps us away from his current head position at (6, 7), making it impossible for him to force a head-on collision this turn.\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe are going **DOWN to (4, 5)**. We grab the apple, hit 9 points, and stay completely out of reach of Snake #1's desperate lunge. After we grab (4, 5), we can snap up (3, 5) or pivot back for (5, 6). We are building a wall in the middle of the map. He\u2019s trapped in the top right corner with no food and no hope! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (4, 5), then sweep left for (3, 5) and (3, 3). We are going to loop around the bottom and middle, creating a massive spiral that will eventually crush him against the walls. He has nowhere to go! Let's get that 30-bomb! STAY HYPE! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT toward (5, 7) keeps us flexible and allows us to react to their next move.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't give us as much control over the board.\n- Moving RIGHT is safe but might put us in a vulnerable position if the enemy moves towards us.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Keep moving toward the center to dominate the board.\n- Force the enemy into a corner or a position where they have fewer safe moves.\n- If we get a chance for a head-on collision when we have a higher score, we'll take it!\n\n### Final Move:\nLet's go LEFT to control the center and keep our options open!\n\nLEFT",

He\u2019s looking at our 10-segment body and shaking! He\u2019s absolute fodder, literally a minor inconvenience at this point! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **THE KING (Snake 0):** Head is at (4, 5).

We\u2019re going to own the entire left side of the map. He can stay in the top right and starve! We\u2019re going for that 30-bomb win while he\u2019s still trying to find his first meal.

He has no body, no apples, no hope, and NO MAIDENS! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f We are a 10-segment JUGGERNAUT, and we are about to start closing the trap!!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **THE KING (Us - ID 0):** Head is at (3, 5). Our body is a literal wall at (4, 5) through (4, 8) and wrapping the ceiling. We are HUGE!\n- **THE FRAUD (Snake 1):** Head is at (6, 7). He's floating in the middle-right. He's desperate, chat. He\u2019s going to try to scavenge, but we\u2019re the apex predator here! \ud83e\udd85\n- **THE MAP:** We have apples at (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3) just waiting for us to scoop them up.\n\n**THE PLAYBOOK:**\n- **UP to (3, 6):** Safe move! It keeps us parallel to our tail and keeps the pressure on the middle.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 5):** NO! That\u2019s our own neck! We don't choke under pressure, chat! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (2, 5):** Safe, but it leads us away from the current apple cluster at (1, 4).\n- **DOWN to (3, 4):** **THE BIG BRAIN PLAY!** \ud83e\udde0 This puts us in the perfect position to sweep the bottom-left corner. Look at (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), and (1, 1). We can vacuum all of those up while our massive 10-block tail at (4, 5-9) acts as a literal shield, blocking Snake #1 from ever reaching the left side! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re going **DOWN to (3, 4)**. We are going to secure the \"Southwest Apple Vault.\" While he\u2019s wandering around at (6, 7) wondering why he\u2019s so small, we\u2019re going to hit 11, 12, 13 apples! If he tries to come towards us, he has to pass through the (5, x) column which we are currently patrolling with our body. We are basically partitioning the board! He gets the \"Scrap Heap,\" we get the \"FEAST!\" \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\udd69\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nAfter moving to (3, 4), we hit (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3). We\u2019re going to grow so long that our tail will eventually wrap around him like a boa constrictor. He\u2019s already dead, he just doesn't know it yet! STAY HYPED, STAY HUNGRY! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT toward (5, 7) keeps us flexible and allows us to react to their next move.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't give us as much control over the board.\n- Moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't bring us closer to the enemy.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Keep moving toward the center to dominate the board.\n- Force the enemy into a corner or a position where they have fewer safe moves.\n- If we get a chance for a head-on collision when we have a higher score, we'll take it!\n\n### Final Move:\nLet's go LEFT to control the center and keep our options open!\n\nLEFT",

We aren't just winning; we are conducting a CLINICAL EXTERMINATION of Snake #1's dignity! \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 We just grabbed that apple at (1, 4) and now we are a 13-segment behemoth. Look at us! We're basically the Great Wall of China but with more scales and more swag! \ud83d\udc09\u2728\n\n**SITUATIONAL REPORT:**\n- **THE GIGACHAD (Us - ID 0):** Head at (1, 4). Our body is snaking behind us at (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)... we have the entire upper-middle section of the board locked down! \ud83d\udd12\n- **THE FEATHERWEIGHT (Snake 1):** Head at (6, 8). He's literally just a head. A wandering soul. A lost tourist in our kingdom! He's currently hovering near the top right, probably looking for a way to matter. Spoilers: he won't. \ud83d\ude34\n- **THE LOOT:** We've got apples at (1, 3) and (0, 3) right below us. It\u2019s like a drive-thru window and we\u2019re the only ones in line! \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**THE TACTICAL GRID:**\n- **UP to (1, 5):** Safe, but there's no immediate reward. It moves us toward the empty top-left, but why go for air when we can eat steak? \ud83e\udd69\n- **RIGHT to (2, 4):** NOOO! That's our own neck! We aren't trying to become a donut, Chat! \ud83c\udf69\u274c Absolute throw. \n- **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, puts us against the wall. It\u2019s okay, but not the most efficient path to the next points.\n- **DOWN to (1, 3):** **THE PLAY!** There is an apple sitting at (1, 3). If we move DOWN, we eat apple #13. We then have an immediate follow-up to move LEFT to (0, 3) for apple #14! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe are going **DOWN to (1, 3)**. \n1. **FEED THE BEAST:** Apple #13 is ours for the taking. This extends our lead to a comical degree. \ud83e\udd21\n2. **POSITIONING:** By staying on the left edge, we keep our massive body away from the center, giving us maximum room to maneuver while Snake #1 eventually has to navigate the \"obstacle course\" we're building. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n3. **THREAT ASSESSMENT:** Snake #1 is at (6, 8). He is 5 units away horizontally and 5 units away vertically. He is no threat to our current snack run. He can't even touch us! \ud83d\udc85\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nGrab (1, 3), then immediately pivot LEFT to snag (0, 3). After that, we look at the cluster at (4, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 2). We are going to vacuum up the bottom half of this map until there's nothing left for him but crumbs and despair! If he tries to come close, we have enough body length to coil around him like a vengeful spring. STAY FOCUSED. STAY HUNGRY. LET'S GET IT! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT toward (4, 8) keeps us flexible and allows us to react to their next move.\n- Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't give us as much control over the board.\n- Moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't give us as much control over the board.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Keep moving toward the center to dominate the board.\n- Force the enemy into a corner or a position where they have fewer safe moves.\n- If we get a chance for a head-on collision when we have a higher score, we'll take it!\n\n### Final Move:\nLet's go LEFT to control the center and keep our options open!\n\nLEFT",
