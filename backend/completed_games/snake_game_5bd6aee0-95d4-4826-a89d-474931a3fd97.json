Where is the enemy snake? At (1,7) and (2,7), far away, so no immediate danger.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, moving RIGHT will get me directly adjacent to (5,3) next turn at (6,3) or (5,3) if I keep going right and then up.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP leads to (4,4), more vertical, but the apple is at (5,3) which is slightly below.\n\nBut an approach from below (UP) is useful to access apples around (6,4)...\n\nAnother consideration is the body: my current body is at (3,2), and my head is at (4,2). Moving RIGHT will move head to (5,2), the body will shift forward.\n\nAlso, moving UP to (4,3) is safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,1) would move away from apple and no apparent benefit.\n\nSo best choices are UP and RIGHT.\n\nSince last move was RIGHT, continuing RIGHT is consistent.\n\nBut moving UP might give better options in next moves since the apple (5,3) is at y=3, and moving UP now puts me closer on y-axis to the apple.\n\nSo considering that, moving UP now could be slightly better as it brings the snake closer vertically to the apple.\n\nSo move UP.\n\n**Next strategy:**\n\nAfter the next move UP, depending on tile occupancy, move RIGHT to (5,3) to eat apple.\n\nThen target apples at (6,4), (8,4) or (8,8), depending on proximity.\n\nNext move: **UP**"

The closest apples are (5, 3), (8, 8), and (6, 4), all with a Manhattan distance of 8. Moving RIGHT is the most direct initial direction towards these, but it is blocked.\n\nI must choose a safe move. Moving LEFT to (0, 7) increases the minimum distance to all apples. Moving UP to (1, 8) results in the apple at (8, 8) being the closest with a distance of 7. Moving DOWN to (1, 6) results in the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 4) being the closest with a distance of 7.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN decrease the minimum distance to an apple compared to my current position. I evaluate these two options considering the enemy snake at (4, 2). The enemy's closest apple appears to be (5, 3). Moving DOWN towards (1, 6) would likely lead me towards the same area as the enemy snake, increasing the risk of collision or competition for resources. Moving UP towards (1, 8) targets the apple at (8, 8), which is further away from the enemy's current position and likely path. Therefore, moving UP is the safest and strategically better choice to pursue an apple with less immediate risk.\n\nNext turn strategy: I will be at (1, 8). I will re-evaluate the closest apples and available safe moves, prioritizing moves that bring me closer to the nearest apple, especially (8, 8), while avoiding collisions with walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nMove: UP"

Let's analyze.\n\nMy current body is [(4,2)]. Usually, in Snake games, the tail moves forward unless I just ate an apple.

No.\n- Enemy is far.\n- No walls at (5,3).\n- Moving RIGHT means I eat apple at (5,3) and grow.\n\nTherefore moving RIGHT is good.\n\nMoving UP or DOWN or LEFT delays apple eating.\n\nSo for maximizing points, best move now is RIGHT.\n\nStrategy next turn: After eating apple at (5,3), target apples at (6,4), (8,4), then (8,8), moving safely towards these.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

My body segments are at [(5, 9), (5, 8)].\nApples are at: (8, 8), (6, 0), (7, 2), (0, 1), (1, 4).\nEnemy Snake #1 is at head (8, 5) with body at [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].\n\nLet's determine the safe moves from my current head position (6, 9):\n- UP to (6, 10): Invalid (wall collision - Y > 9).\n- DOWN to (6, 8): Valid (within board, not self, not enemy head/body).\n- LEFT to (5, 9): Invalid (self collision - my first body segment is there).\n- RIGHT to (7, 9): Valid (within board, not self, not enemy head/body).\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current position (6, 9) to each apple:\n- (8, 8): |6-8| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6, 0): |6-6| + |9-0| = 0 + 9 = 9\n- (7, 2): |6-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- (0, 1): |6-0| + |9-1| = 6 + 8 = 14\n- (1, 4): |6-1| + |9-4| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (8, 8) with a distance of 3.\n\nEvaluating the safe moves towards the closest apple (8, 8):\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 8): Distance to (8, 8) becomes |6-8| + |8-8| = 2 + 0 = 2. Decreases distance.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 9): Distance to (8, 8) becomes |7-8| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2. Decreases distance.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves that decrease the distance to the nearest apple (8, 8) to 2. The enemy snake at (8, 5) is also currently 3 moves away from the apple (8, 8) (e.g., (8,5)->(8,6)->(8,7)->(8,8)). It is likely the enemy will also move towards this apple.\n\nBoth moving DOWN and moving RIGHT put me in a position from which I can reach (7,8) in one more turn ((6,8)->(7,8) or (7,9)->(7,8)). From (7,8), I would be one step away from the apple at (8,8). However, the enemy is likely to reach (8,7) by the time I reach (7,8), leading to a potential collision at (8,8).\n\nI need to choose a move that allows for a safe escape from the potential collision point at (8,8) if the enemy arrives simultaneously or first. If I reach (7,8) while the enemy is at (8,7), moving to (8,8) would likely result in a head-to-head collision.\n\nLet's analyze escape options from (7,8), depending on my first move:\n- If I move DOWN to (6,8) first, my body next turn will include (6,8). From (7,8), safe moves towards the apple or escape are (7,9) (UP), (7,7) (DOWN). (6,8) (LEFT) would be a body collision.\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,9) first, my body next turn will include (7,9). From (7,8), safe moves towards the apple or escape are (7,7) (DOWN), (6,8) (LEFT). (7,9) (UP) would be a body collision.\n\nBoth paths lead to (7,8) and offer safe escape routes (e.7,7). The path starting with RIGHT also offers escape to (6,8), while the path starting with DOWN offers escape to (7,9). Escaping to (7,7) or (6,8) seems preferable to (7,9) as they move away from the wall and the enemy's likely path in column 8. Moving RIGHT to (7,9) therefore seems slightly better as it preserves the more favorable escape route options from the subsequent position (7,8).\n\nAlthough moving RIGHT to (7,9) puts me closer to the top wall (Y=9), the slight advantage in potential escape options from the subsequent position (7,8) makes it the preferred move. I will move towards the apple while ensuring a safe path if the enemy contests it.\n\nNext turn strategy: From (7,9), I will likely move DOWN to (7,8) to position myself near the apple. Then, I will evaluate the enemy's position. If the enemy is also positioned to take the apple at (8,8), I will prioritize survival by moving to a safe adjacent square like (7,7) or (6,8), yielding the apple if necessary.\n\nMove: RIGHT"

Decreases distance.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 9): Distance to (8, 8) becomes |8-8| + |9-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. Decreases distance.\n\nBoth safe moves, DOWN to (7,8) and RIGHT to (8,9), lead to positions that are 1 step away from the closest apple at (8,8).\n\nNow consider the enemy snake at (8, 6). Its distance to the apple (8, 8) is |8-8| + |6-8| = 0 + 2 = 2. The enemy is also 2 steps away from the apple. The enemy is likely to move UP to (8, 7) which would put them 1 step away from the apple.\n\nIf both I and the enemy move towards the apple, we would both be one step away from (8,8) in the next turn, potentially leading to a head-to-head collision if we both try to move to (8,8). Survival is the top priority. I need to choose a move that allows for a safe retreat if the apple is contested.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 8), my body becomes [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. From (7, 8), potential moves are UP (body collision), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). If the enemy is at (8,7) planning to go to (8,8), moving RIGHT to (8,8) is risky. Safe retreat options are DOWN to (7,7) and LEFT to (6,8). These are good positions away from the wall and the enemy's likely path.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 9), my body becomes [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. From (8, 9), potential moves are UP (wall), DOWN (8,8), LEFT (body collision), RIGHT (9,9). If the enemy is at (8,7) planning to go to (8,8), moving DOWN to (8,8) is risky. A safe retreat option is RIGHT to (9,9). This position is against the wall.\n\nComparing the two safe moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 8) positions me to potentially retreat to (7,7) or (6,8), offering more flexibility and better positions away from the wall.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) positions me against the wall, with only one safe retreat option (9,9) if the apple is contested.\n\nMoving DOWN provides better options for survival if the apple at (8,8) becomes dangerous due to the enemy's movement.\n\nNext turn strategy: From (7,8), I will check the enemy's position. If the enemy is also moving towards (8,8) (likely ending up at (8,7)), I will prioritize moving to a safe square like (7,7) or (6,8) rather than risking a collision at (8,8). If the enemy moves elsewhere, or if I can safely reach the apple first, I will take the apple.\n\nMove: DOWN\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

The safe move RIGHT to (8, 8) would land me on this apple.\n\nNow, let's consider the enemy snake. The enemy head is at (8, 7). Its Manhattan distance to the closest apple at (8, 8) is |8-8| + |7-8| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nBoth my snake and the enemy snake are 1 step away from the same apple at (8, 8).\nMy potential move to the apple is RIGHT to (8, 8).\nThe enemy's potential move to the apple is UP to (8, 8).\nIf both snakes move to (8, 8), it results in a head-to-head collision, which is fatal.\n\nSurvival is the top priority. Moving RIGHT to the apple at (8, 8) is risky because the enemy is also one step away and likely competing for it. It's highly probable the enemy will move UP to (8, 8).\n\nTherefore, I should avoid the risky move to (8, 8). The remaining safe moves are DOWN to (7, 7) and LEFT to (6, 8).\n\nLet's evaluate these safe, non-apple moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 7): This square is currently empty. If I move here, my head will be at (7, 7). The enemy is at (8, 7). A potential enemy move is LEFT to (7, 7). If I move DOWN to (7, 7) and the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 7), this would be a head-to-head collision. This move is also potentially risky.\n- Moving LEFT to (6, 8): This square is currently empty. If I move here, my head will be at (6, 8). The enemy is at (8, 7). If the enemy moves UP to (8, 8) (to the apple), LEFT to (7, 7), or RIGHT to (9, 7), none of these moves result in a collision with me at (6, 8). Moving LEFT to (6, 8) puts me further away from the enemy's immediate vicinity and their likely paths near the apple.\n\nComparing the safe non-apple moves:\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 7) carries a risk of head-to-head collision if the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 7).\n- Moving LEFT to (6, 8) appears to be safe regardless of the enemy's most probable moves (towards the apple, or left/right from their current position).\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 8) is the safest option that prioritizes survival by avoiding potential collisions around the contested apple and adjacent squares. I sacrifice getting the apple this turn to ensure I stay alive.\n\nNext turn strategy: From (6,8), re-evaluate the board state. Check if the apple at (8,8) is still available and safe. Locate the enemy snake and other apples and plan the next move prioritizing safe movement towards a closer, safe apple, or simply maintaining a safe position.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Within board (0-9, 0-9), not occupied by my body (7,8), (7,9) or enemy segments/head.\n- DOWN to (6, 7): Valid. Within board, not occupied by my body or enemy.\n- LEFT to (5, 8): Valid. Within board, not occupied by my body or enemy.\n- RIGHT to (7, 8): Invalid. This cell is occupied by my body segment.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (6, 9), DOWN to (6, 7), and LEFT to (5, 8).\n\nNow, let's evaluate these safe moves based on proximity to apples and potential conflicts.\nThe apples are at (6, 0), (7, 2), (0, 1), (1, 4), (3, 7).\nMy head is at (6, 8).\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current position (6, 8) to each apple:\n- (6, 0): |6-6| + |8-0| = 0 + 8 = 8\n- (7, 2): |6-7| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n- (0, 1): |6-0| + |8-1| = 6 + 7 = 13\n- (1, 4): |6-1| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n- (3, 7): |6-3| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 7) with a distance of 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves based on their destination's distance to the closest apple (3, 7):\n- Move UP to (6, 9): Distance from (6, 9) to (3, 7) is |6-3| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5. (Increases distance from closest apple)\n- Move DOWN to (6, 7): Distance from (6, 7) to (3, 7) is |6-3| + |7-7| = 3 + 0 = 3. (Decreases distance from closest apple)\n- Move LEFT to (5, 8): Distance from (5, 8) to (3, 7) is |5-3| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Decreases distance from closest apple)\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT moves reduce the distance to the closest apple (3, 7). Moving UP increases the distance.\n\nNow consider the enemy snake #1. It is at (8, 8) with body segments from (8, 7) down to (7, 4). My snake is length 3, the enemy is length 6. The enemy is longer and currently positioned to the right of me.\n\nMy safe moves (DOWN to (6,7) and LEFT to (5,8)) do not immediately lead to a collision with the enemy's current head (8,8) or body segments. The enemy's safe moves from (8,8) would be UP to (8,9) or RIGHT to (9,8), neither of which would cause immediate collision with me moving to (6,7) or (5,8).\n\nComparing the two safe moves that move towards the closest apple:\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 7): Positions me in cell (6,7). This keeps me in the middle columns but moves me closer to the lower half of the board where the enemy's body segment at (7,4) is located, and also where other apples ((6,0), (7,2)) are located.\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 8): Positions me in cell (5,8). This moves me into column 5, further away from the enemy snake which is primarily in columns 8 and 7. It also positions me closer to the apples on the left side ((0,1), (1,4)) while still decreasing distance to (3,7).\n\nGiven the enemy is longer and currently positioned to my right, moving LEFT to (5, 8) seems strategically safer as it increases the distance between my snake and the enemy's main occupied area, providing more space to maneuver and reducing the chance of getting trapped by the longer snake's body. It also moves towards the closest apple (3,7) and positions me well to potentially access the apples on the left side.\n\nNext turn strategy: From (5,8), re-evaluate the board state. Check the status of the apple at (3,7). Continue prioritizing safe moves that lead towards the closest *safe* apple. Keep track of the enemy's movements and position to avoid potential collisions or traps.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

The enemy length is 6.\n\nLet's identify the possible moves from my current head position (3, 8):\n- UP to (3, 9): This cell is within the board boundaries (0-9, 0-9), not occupied by my body [(4, 8), (5, 8)], and not occupied by the enemy.

This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (4, 8): This cell is occupied by my body segment (neck). This is not a safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are UP to (3, 9), DOWN to (3, 7), and LEFT to (2, 8).\n\nNow, let's consider the location of the apples.\nMy head is at (3, 8).\nCalculating the Manhattan distance from my current position (3, 8) to each apple:\n- (6, 0): |3-6| + |8-0| = 3 + 8 = 11\n- (7, 2): |3-7| + |8-2| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- (0, 1): |3-0| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n- (1, 4): |3-1| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- (3, 7): |3-3| + |8-7| = 0 + 1 = 1\nThe closest apple is at (3, 7) with a distance of 1.\n\nEvaluating the safe moves based on their destination:\n- Move UP to (3, 9): Moves away from the closest apple at (3, 7).\n- Move DOWN to (3, 7): Lands directly on the closest apple at (3, 7).\n- Move LEFT to (2, 8): Moves away from the closest apple at (3, 7).\n\nMoving DOWN immediately gets me the closest apple. Eating an apple increases my length and points, which is generally desirable.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake. It is at (9, 6) with a body extending around that area. My snake is currently in columns 3, 4, and 5. The enemy is far away and poses no immediate threat of collision for any of my safe moves.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 7) is the most advantageous move as it allows me to consume the closest apple safely.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving DOWN to (3,7) and eating the apple, my head will be at (3,7) and my body will be at [(3,8), (4,8)]. My length will increase to 4. I will then need to find the next closest apple from my new position and plan a safe path while continuing to monitor the enemy's movements and avoiding collisions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

This is not a safe move.\n- DOWN to (3, 6): This cell is within the board boundaries and not occupied by my body or the enemy.

This is a safe move.\n- RIGHT to (4, 7): This cell is within the board boundaries and not occupied by my body or the enemy. This is a safe move.\n\nMy safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nNow I will find the closest apple from my current head position (3, 7) using Manhattan distance:\n- (6, 0): |3-6| + |7-0| = 3 + 7 = 10\n- (7, 2): |3-7| + |7-2| = 4 + 5 = 9\n- (0, 1): |3-0| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9\n- (1, 4): |3-1| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3, 9): |3-3| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 9) with a distance of 2. The next closest is at (1, 4) with a distance of 5.\n\nI want to move towards the closest apple at (3, 9). The direct path from (3, 7) to (3, 9) is UP twice. However, moving UP to (3, 8) is blocked by my body. I need to find a path around my body to reach (3, 9).\n\nLet's consider paths starting with my safe moves:\n- If I move DOWN to (3, 6): This moves away from (3, 9). Getting back up to column 3 high enough to reach (3,9) might be difficult due to my body at (3,8), (4,8), (5,8).\n- If I move RIGHT to (4, 7): This also moves away from (3, 9). Moving up from here towards (3,9) would involve going through (4,8) or (5,8) which are blocked by my body.\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 7): From (2,7), I can move UP to (2,8), then UP to (2,9), then RIGHT to (3,9). Let's check the safety of this potential path:\n    - Current: (3,7). Move LEFT to (2,7). Safe. New head: (2,7), body: [(3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)].\n    - From (2,7). Move UP to (2,8). (2,8) is safe (not on body or enemy). New head: (2,8), body: [(2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8)].\n    - From (2,8). Move UP to (2,9). (2,9) is safe. New head: (2,9), body: [(2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8)].\n    - From (2,9). Move RIGHT to (3,9). (3,9) is an apple and is safe. New head: (3,9), body: [(2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7)].\n\nThis path starting with LEFT seems viable and leads to the closest apple in 4 moves. The enemy snake is far away and doesn't threaten this path.\n\nMoving LEFT is the best move to get to the closest apple.\n\nNext turn strategy: If I successfully move LEFT to (2,7), my strategy will be to continue the path towards the apple at (3,9) by moving UP to (2,8), then UP to (2,9), then RIGHT to (3,9). I will monitor the board state and enemy movement to ensure the path remains safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

          "rationale": "Alright, the snake's current head position after moving LEFT last turn is now at (7,5).\n\nLet's analyze the situation carefully:  \n- Apples are at (6, 0), (7, 2), (0, 1), (1, 4), (3, 9).  \n- Our main goal remains to get to (7,2) first since it's the closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Current head position:** (7,5)  \n**Body occupies:** [(6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] \u2013 but after last move body will have shifted, so new body after the last move LEFT is:  \nNew head (7,5), body would shift: (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6) \u2014 assuming the tail moves forward (we lose the last tail segment as snake moved).\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (7,5):**  \n- UP to (7,6)  \n- DOWN to (7,4)  \n- LEFT to (6,5) (normally this is where the body was, but could be free due to movement)  \n- RIGHT to (8,5) (Is this backwards? The last head was at (8,5), moving right would be moving back into itself, so illegal)\n\n---\n\n**Check move legality:**\n\n- RIGHT to (8,5) is moving back onto body (already occupied), so illegal.\n\n- LEFT to (6,5): Is this safe? Is (6,5) part of the body? Our snake's body includes (6,5) but since the snake moved left in last move, the tail shifts forward and (9,7) will be vacated. This needs more precise consideration:\n\nOur positions before last move were:  \nHead: (8,5)  \nBody: [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)]\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (7,5), the snake's body will be:  \nNew head: (7,5),  \nThen previous head position becomes new body: (8,5),  \nThen from there the body shifts forward, drop the tail segment.\n\nSo new body after move:  \n[(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] minus the tail (9,7), now tail is at (9,6)\n\nTherefore positions occupied after move are:  \nHead: (7,5)  \nBody: [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7)] tail likely moved forward, so (9,7) would be vacated. Assuming the snake did not eat an apple last move, the tail moves forward, so actual tail is one tile less. So (9,7) becomes free.\n\nThus, is (6,5) free or occupied? The body was at (6,5) before the last move? No, it's not listed in the body anymore.\n\nTherefore, (6,5) now is free to move onto.\n\n- DOWN to (7,4): Is this free?  \nNo snake body there. So safe.\n\n- UP to (7,6): Also free from body or enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Checking proximity to apple at (7,2):**  \n- Moving DOWN (7,4) would bring us closer on the y-axis to that apple.  \n- Moving LEFT to (6,5) moves away from x=7 apple, but could be navigating around some obstacle.  \n- Moving UP (7,6) moves away from apples y=2 and 0.\n\nNo immediate threats at (6,5), (7,4), or (7,6).\n\n---\n\n**Strategy:**  \nOur best path to get to apple (7,2) is to get down the y-axis quickly. So DOWN to (7,4) looks like a viable direction.\n\nLEFT to (6,5) would get us closer to apple at (6,0), but seems more lateral and could waste time or cause track looping.\n\nUP to (7,6) is away from the target apples.\n\nTherefore, **MOVE DOWN** to (7,4).\n\nNext turn we can consider moving farther DOWN towards (7,2).\n\n---\n\n**Final move decision:** DOWN"

This is the best move because it gains a point and grows the snake.\n- DOWN to (7,0): Empty but no apple there.\n- LEFT to (6,1): This is our previous head position but should be allowed since it's not immediate backward move (snake moves forward).\n- RIGHT to (8,1): Seems open, but no immediate gain.\n\nGiven that the apple is right above, moving UP is optimal.\n\nAfter moving UP to (7,2) and eating the apple, we should look next to the remaining apples at (0,1), (1,4), and (9,0). The (0,1) and (1,4) apples are somewhat close on the left side, while (9,0) is far right-bottom corner.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,4) with a vertical body placed at (3,5) to (3,9), which does not immediately block our path to the left-side apples.\n\nStrategy for subsequent turns could be to head toward (1,4) or (0,1) after grabbing the apple at (7,2), but for now, immediate priority is to pick up the apple at (7,2).\n\nNext move: UP"

My neck is at (3, 5).\nThe board is 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (6, 0), (7, 2), (0, 1), (1, 4), (9, 0).\nEnemy Snake #1 head is at (6, 1) and body is at [(5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)].\n\nLet's determine the safe moves from my current head position (3, 4):\nBoard bounds: 0 <= x <= 9, 0 <= y <= 9.\nMy body (excluding head): [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)]. My neck is at (3, 5).\nEnemy head: (6, 1).\nEnemy body: [(5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)].\n\n- UP to (3, 5): This coordinate is occupied by my neck segment (3, 5). Unsafe (cannot move directly backwards).\n- DOWN to (3, 3): This coordinate is within board bounds. It is not occupied by any of my body segments. It is not occupied by the enemy snake head or body. It is not a wall. This move is safe.\n- LEFT to (2, 4): This coordinate is within board bounds. It is not occupied by any of my body segments. It is not occupied by the enemy snake head or body. It is not a wall. This move is safe.\n- RIGHT to (4, 4): This coordinate is within board bounds. It is not occupied by any of my body segments. It is not occupied by the enemy snake head or body. It is not a wall. This move is safe.\n\nMy safe moves are DOWN to (3, 3), LEFT to (2, 4), and RIGHT to (4, 4).\n\nNow, let's find the closest apple using Manhattan distance from my current head position (3, 4):\n- Apple at (6, 0): |3-6| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- Apple at (7, 2): |3-7| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- Apple at (0, 1): |3-0| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- Apple at (1, 4): |3-1| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- Apple at (9, 0): |3-9| + |4-0| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate which safe move brings me closer to the closest apple at (1, 4):\n- Current distance to (1, 4): 2\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 3): The new distance to (1, 4) is |3-1| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3. Distance increased.\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 4): The new distance to (1, 4) is |2-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1. Distance decreased.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 4): The new distance to (1, 4) is |4-1| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3. Distance increased.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 4) is the only safe move that decreases the distance to the closest apple (1, 4). This move positions me adjacent to the apple, allowing me to eat it on the next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the closest apple if the path is safe and reduces the distance. Consider alternative safe paths if the direct path is blocked or leads to a dangerous situation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."
