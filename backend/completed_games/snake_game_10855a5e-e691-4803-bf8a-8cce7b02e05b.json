Let's break this down and get this W!\n\n**OUR CURRENT STATE:**\n- Snake 1 (ME): Head at (0,0), body none, score 0\n- Snake 0: Head at (5,8), body none, score 0\n- Apple drops: 15 apples scattered across the board\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- My head is in the bottom-left corner at (0,0) \n- Snake 0 is way up in the middle-right at (5,8)\n- We have a clear distance between us for now\n- Board has apples spread everywhere\n\n**MOVES TO CONSIDER:**\n1. **UP to (0,1)**: Safe! Empty cell. Keeps me alive and moves toward top-left region.\n2. **RIGHT to (1,0)**: Safe! Empty cell. Moves right along bottom edge.\n3. **DOWN to (0,-1)**: IMMEDIATE DEATH! Off the board! \u274c\n4. **LEFT to (-1,0)**: IMMEDIATE DEATH! Off the board! \u274c\n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN and LEFT - both immediate death! That's not content, that's a fail!\n\n**SAFE OPTIONS REMAINING:**\n- UP to (0,1)\n- RIGHT to (1,0)\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI need to think about how to box in Snake 0. With my head in the corner, I have TWO safe moves. The UP move gives me access to more of the board and moves me toward the apple at (1,1) or (0,5). The RIGHT move keeps me along the bottom edge but limits my vertical mobility.\n\nSince Snake 0 is at (5,8) in the upper-middle, I want to start positioning myself to control the board. The UP move gives me better board control and more escape routes. I can work my way toward the center-left and potentially cut off Snake 0's access to the left side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter moving UP to (0,1), I'll evaluate the position. I want to start working toward the center-left area (around x=2-4) to establish territory. Snake 0 is in the upper-right quadrant, so I need to claim the left side and prepare to either trap them or force a head-on collision when I have more mass.\n\n**MY MOVE:** UP - because it gives me better board control and keeps my future options open! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nUP",

None of those clash with any of our four squares, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible right now.\n\n**Strategic takeaway:**  \nGrab the apple now, grow, and start hemming in the rival from the top\u2011right side of the board. After we\u2019re at (5,\u202f9) we\u2019ll have a clear path to the second apple at (7,\u202f9) and can start shaping a wall that forces the opponent into a corner. The longer we get, the more \u201cbody\u2011blocking\u201d power we have.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **UP** to (5,\u202f9) and eat the apple.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn head **RIGHT** toward (6,\u202f9) \u2192 (7,\u202f9) for another apple.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the top\u2011row occupied, shrink the opponent\u2019s safe space, and look for a head\u2011on when we\u2019re ahead in score.\n\nNo risk of self\u2011collision (we\u2019re only length\u202f1), no risk of running off the board, and we lock in a point instantly. Let\u2019s do it! \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n**Final move:**  \n\nUP",

Let's get this W! \n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (0,1), body empty, score 0. I'm on the left edge, one step up from the bottom corner.\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (5,9), body [(5,8)], score 1. They're at the top-right, near the edge, with a body trailing below them.\n- **Apple Map:** 15 apples scattered. Closest to me: (1,1) is RIGHT next door, and (0,5) is straight up the left wall. Snake #0 has apples at (7,9) and (8,4), but they're far from my zone.\n\n**MOVES FROM CURRENT HEAD (0,1):**\n1. **UP to (0,2):** EMPTY. Safe. Opens path to (0,5) and center-left. **GOOD OPTION.**\n2. **DOWN to (0,0):** EMPTY. Safe. Keeps me in corner. **OKAY, BUT TERRIBLE.**\n3. **LEFT to (-1,1):** OFF BOARD. **DEATH.** \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (1,1):** APPLE! (1,1) is an apple. This means I GROW +1 point. Also EMPTY. **OPTIMAL OPTION.**\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT (instant death). DOWN is safe but stupid\u2014I want to grow and expand, not cower in a corner!\n\n**SAFE & SMART CHOICES:**\n- **RIGHT to (1,1):** Eats apple, gains +1 point (tied score!), moves toward the action. I'll have a body segment at (0,1) after this move, giving me some mass.\n- **UP to (0,2):** Safe but wastes a turn\u2014no apple, no growth, no progress toward boxing in the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR TURN 2+:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1,1), my head will be at (1,1) with body trailing at (0,1). Next turn, I can branch out: UP toward (1,2) or (2,2) to head toward the center-left cluster (apples at (2,6), (2,7), etc.). Snake #0 is top-right, so I'll claim the left side and start closing the cage. If I get aggressive later, I can force a head-on collision when I have more mass\u2014since they have 1 apple and I'll have 1, we're even, but growth gives me leverage.\n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT. Eat that apple, start the grind, and let's box this rival in! CHAT, WE'RE PULLING AHEAD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Score: 1.\n- **Snake #0:** Head at **(6, 9)**, Body at **[(5, 9)]**. Score: 1.\n- **Apple Map:** 15 apples scattered. I just ate (1, 1) last turn? Wait, no. The apple list shows (7,9), (8,4)... but (1,1) wasn't in the list. Looking at the board: `(1, 1)` shows a `1` (my head), and `(0, 1)` shows `T` (my tail). The apple at (1,1) must be gone. The remaining apples are as listed. Closest to me: (2, 7) is 6 squares away, (4, 3) is 5 squares away, (2, 6) is 5 squares away. Snake #0 is near (7,9) and (8,4) apples, far from me.\n\n**MOVES FROM HEAD (1, 1):**\n1. **UP to (1, 2):** EMPTY. Safe. Opens path upward. **GOOD OPTION.**\n2. **DOWN to (1, 0):** EMPTY. Safe. Bottom row. **OKAY, BUT LIMITS ME.**\n3. **LEFT to (0, 1):** **CRASH!** That's my own body (tail). DEAD. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 1):** EMPTY. Safe. Moves toward center. **GOOD OPTION.**\n\n**ELIMINATED:** LEFT (suicide into my own body).\n\n**DECISION TIME: UP vs RIGHT vs DOWN.**\n\n**DOWN to (1,0):** SAFE but trapped. I'd be on the bottom edge with only UP and RIGHT as future options (LEFT is (0,0) which is empty, but that's back to the wall). This limits my mobility. Avoid.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,1):** SAFE. Moves east, toward the center. From there, I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT goes back to (1,1) which will be empty since I'm moving). Good flexibility. Opens path to (2,6) and (2,7) apples.\n\n**UP to (1,2):** SAFE. Moves north, toward (1,9) apple (though that's far) and opens path to (2,2) etc. Also good flexibility.\n\n**STRATEGY PLANNING:**\nI want to dominate the board and box in Snake #0. Snake #0 is at top-right. I'm at bottom-left. I need to grow and claim territory. Moving RIGHT brings me to (2,1), which is closer to the center and the cluster of apples at (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6). Moving UP also gets me moving, but RIGHT feels more direct toward the action.\n\nAlso, check board state: `(2, 1)` is empty on the board (row 1 shows `T 1 . . . . . . . .` so index 2 is `.`). Safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Turn 2: Moving RIGHT to (2,1) to approach the central apple cluster. Goal: grow quickly to out-size opponent. Watch Snake #0's movements\u2014if they go down toward (8,4), I can flank from left. Avoid getting cornered on edges. Next turn from (2,1), I'll have options UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT back to (1,1) empty). Ready to pivot based on enemy.\"\n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT. Let's close the gap and set up for a massive grow-up!

Let\u2019s break it down.  \n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**  \n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(2, 3)**, Body at **[(2, 2)]**. Score: 1.  \n- **Snake #0:** Head at **(8, 8)**, Body at **[(8, 9), (7, 9)]**. Score: 2.  \n- **Last Move:** UP to (2, 3). Good positioning! Now I\u2019m at (2, 3) with my tail at (2, 2).  \n\n**MOVES FROM HEAD (2, 3):**  \n1. **UP to (2, 4):** EMPTY. Safe. Moves toward (2,6) apple (2 steps away). **GOOD OPTION.**  \n2. **DOWN to (2, 2):** **CRASH!** That\u2019s my own body. DEAD. \u274c  \n3. **LEFT to (1, 3):** EMPTY. Safe. Moves left, but away from apples. **OKAY, BUT NOT IDEAL.**  \n4. **RIGHT to (3, 3):** EMPTY. Safe. Moves toward (4,3) apple (1 step away from there) and (3,5). **GOOD OPTION.**  \n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN (suicide).  \n\n**DECISION: UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT.**  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 3):** SAFE. But moves me away from the apple cluster in my column and center. I need points to catch up (2-1 deficit). Avoid.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 3):** SAFE. Gets me one step closer to (4,3) apple (if I go RIGHT then UP next turn). Also opens paths to (3,5) and (4,3). **STRONG OPTION.**  \n\n**UP to (2, 4):** SAFE. Directly toward (2,6) apple (2 moves away). From (2,4), I can still go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Keeps me in column 2 for flexibility. The enemy is at (8,8)\u2014far away. No immediate head-on threat.  \n\n**STRATEGY PLANNING:**  \nTurn 5: Move RIGHT to (3, 3). Why? Because (4,3) is only 1 move away from there (UP). This lets me secure an apple faster than the UP path to (2,6) (which takes 2 moves). Fast growth = dominating the board! After eating (4,3), I can pivot to chase Snake #0 or grab more apples. Stay aggressive!  \n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT. CHAT, WE\u2019RE HUNGRY! LET\u2019S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

Keeping the lead while staying alive is priority; a safe down move maintains that lead and builds towards another point.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f8**: **DOWN** to (9,\u202f5).  \n- **Turn\u202f9**: If the corridor stays open, continue **DOWN** toward (9,\u202f0).  \n- **If the bottom\u2011right corridor gets crowded**, veer **LEFT** at the last safe moment to grab the (8,\u202f5) / (8,\u202f4) apples and then swing back up, using our longer body to block the opponent\u2019s retreat.\n\nStay aggressive, stay alive, and let the wall do the heavy lifting!  \n\nDOWN",

Still behind but we're coming! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BOARD SCAN FROM (7, 3):**\n- **UP (7, 4):** Empty - SAFE! (Apple at (7, 5) above, but that's 2 steps away)\n- **DOWN (7, 2):** Empty - SAFE!\n- **LEFT (6, 3):** MY BODY - DEAD IF I GO THERE! \u274c (That's my previous head position, but it's part of my tail now)\n- **RIGHT (8, 3):** Empty - SAFE! (But Apple at (9, 0) is further right, might be out of reach)\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy moved LEFT to (8, 5) from (9, 5) - they're definitely hunting the apple cluster! I see apples at (7, 5) and (8, 4) that both of us can reach. \n\n**DANGER ZONE:** If I go RIGHT to (8, 3) and enemy goes DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4), that's risky because (8, 4) is an apple and they might eat it. But more importantly, if they go DOWN to (8, 4) and I'm at (8, 3), we're not colliding - we're one cell apart vertically.\n\n**REAL TALK:** The apple at (7, 5) is directly above me! If I go UP to (7, 4) now, next turn I can go UP to (7, 5) and eat it. That puts me at 4 apples, still behind but closer.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy at (8, 5) could go DOWN to (8, 4) or LEFT to (7, 5) or RIGHT to (9, 5) or UP to (8, 6).\n- If they go LEFT to (7, 5), that's MY TARGET! But we'd collide if I'm also going there.\n- If I go UP to (7, 4), and they go LEFT to (7, 5), I'm safe at (7, 4) while they eat the apple.\n- If I go RIGHT to (8, 3), and they go DOWN to (8, 4), they get the apple and I'm stuck on the bottom.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (7, 4) is the play! It positions me perfectly to eat the (7, 5) apple next turn, keeps me away from the immediate collision zone, and gives me options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN from (7, 4) if needed.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After reaching (7, 4), I'll aim for (7, 5) apple next turn to grow to 4 apples. Then I'll assess if I can cut off the enemy's path to the apple at (8, 4) or start boxing them into the top-right corner. Gotta force a mistake!\n\nLET'S GO CHAT!

But if they move to (6, 6) or (7, 7), they're moving away from me.\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 4):**\n\n- **UP (8, 5):** That's the enemy's body! DEAD. \u274c\n- **DOWN (8, 3):** Empty! Safe. But puts me closer to my own tail area. \n- **LEFT (7, 4):** That's my own body! DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (9, 4):** Empty! Safe. Open space, but limited.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3):\n- Safe move\n- Opens up (8, 2) for future\n- Gives me room to maneuver\n- Enemy at (7, 6) is currently BLOCKED from hitting me (they can't reach (8, 4) in one move)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 4):\n- Safe move\n- BUT corner situation - limited future moves\n- Could get boxed in\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\nDOWN to (8, 3)! Why?\n1. It's SAFE - no immediate threats\n2. Opens up board space for future turns\n3. Keeps me mobile and aggressive\n4. Enemy is currently moving away from me (they're at (7, 6) looking for apples)\n5. I have 4 apples vs their 7 - I need to stay alive and find more apples, not get trapped\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nStay mobile, avoid corners, keep looking for apple opportunities. The enemy has a 3-apple lead but they're getting cocky in the top-right corner. I need to outmaneuver them and force them into a bad position. Next few moves: stay central, look for apple gaps, and be ready to cut off their escape routes.\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE GOING DOWN! Let's keep this snake flexible!** \ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

The other three are alive, but we want the *best* one.\n\n### Why LEFT wins the day\n1. **Apple power\u2011up** \u2013 (6,6) has a juicy apple. Eating it gives +1 length and +1 point, boosting our lead (we\u2019re already up 7\u20114).  \n2. **Growth = more control** \u2013 because we grow, our tail (8,8) stays put, extending our wall on the right while we slide leftwards. More body = more space to block the opponent later.  \n3. **Boxing potential** \u2013 after we step left, the opponent\u2019s next\u2011move options shrink. If they na\u00efvely go **UP** to (8,5) they\u2019ll crash straight into my body \u2013 instant KO! If they try to circle left, they\u2019ll run into my segment at (7,4).  \n4. **Future freedom** \u2013 moving left pulls us away from the cramped right edge, opening routes toward the centre and the top\u2011right apple cluster (0,9 etc.). Staying on the edge (UP or RIGHT) would keep us boxed against the wall.\n\n### Quick long\u2011term note for the next turns\n> *Goal*: keep hugging the centre\u2011top corridor (x\u202f\u2248\u202f4\u20116, y\u202f\u2265\u202f6) while the enemy is forced down or into my body. Grab the apple at (0,9) once we have a clear path, then swing back down to trap his tail.  \n> *Watch*: opponent may try a desperate jump to the left column; be ready to cut him off with a head\u2011on at (4,5) next turn.\n\n**Decision:** go for the apple, grow, and start tightening the net. \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

Up is fine but pushes us to the right edge where we could soon run into our own tail wall.  \n4. **Pressure on opponent** \u2013 The enemy is stuck near the bottom left (head at (8,3)). By moving left we start carving a wall that will later restrict his escape routes, while he can currently only go **DOWN** to (8,2) or **RIGHT** to (9,3). He can\u2019t threaten us this turn.\n\nGiven the lead (8\u202fvs\u202f4 apples) we can afford a solid, expanding position and later set up a head\u2011on or enclosure.

Let's see what's cooking!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (8, 2)\n- My body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]\n- Enemy head: (5, 6)\n- Enemy body: [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 2):**\n- **UP to (8, 3):** That's MY OWN BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (8, 1):** Empty! Safe! More space below.\n- **LEFT to (7, 2):** Empty! Safe! Moving towards center.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Empty! Safe! But might be corner.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nEnemy is at (5, 6) - still hunting apples in the top-left. They have 8 apples vs my 4, so I need to be AGGRESSIVE but smart. They're definitely growing while I'm trying to set up position.\n\n**MY PLAN:**\nGoing LEFT to (7, 2)! Why?\n1. **TOWARDS THE CENTER:** (7, 2) gets me closer to the action and away from the right edge\n2. **BETTER ANGLES:** From (7, 2) I can go LEFT to (6, 2), DOWN to (7, 1), or UP to (7, 3) - (7, 3) is my body but I'll be growing/shifting\n3. **CUT OFF ENEMY PATH:** I'm positioning to potentially block their routes down the right side\n4. **APPLE ACCESS:** There's an apple at (7, 0) I can start hunting from this better position\n5. **AVOID TRAP:** Going RIGHT to (9, 2) is risky - I'd be in the corner with fewer escape routes\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is probably going for (4, 6) or (6, 5) - they're focused on apples at the top. Let them keep chasing while I set up to dominate the board position from the center!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nGet to (7, 2), then (7, 1) or (6, 2) - I want to create a wall down the right side and cut off the enemy's expansion routes. Once I have position established, I can start aggressive moves to force head-on collisions when I'm ahead in score! \ud83d\udc80\n\nCHAT, LET'S MOVE TOWARDS THE CENTER AND GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

By heading that way I can snag up to three points in the next 2\u20113 turns without risking a collision.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Space control** \u2013 Moving left opens the central\u2011top corridor (x\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u20115, y\u202f\u2265\u202f6). That gives me plenty of escape routes (up, left, down) and prevents me from getting cornered against the right wall.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Opponent distance** \u2013 The rival is down near (8,2). He can\u2019t reach my new position in one move, so I stay out of his immediate danger zone.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future flexibility** \u2013 After the left move my tail will drop from (9,8), freeing a spot on the far right. I\u2019ll still have three viable continuations (up, left, down) on the next turn, keeping my options wide open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** Move LEFT to (4,6).  \n- **Turn\u202f16:** Grab the apple at (3,6).  \n- **Turn\u202f17\u201118:** Continue left to (2,6) and (0,6) while watching the opponent\u2019s drift upward.  \n- If the opponent tries to sneak up the right side, swing up to the top row and cut off his escape, forcing a head\u2011on or trapping him against the wall.\n\nAll signs point to a safe, high\u2011reward path. Let\u2019s slide left and start munching those top\u2011row apples!  \n\nLEFT",

That's my body segment from last turn's move. Can't go back into myself!\n- **DOWN to (7, 1):** \u2705 Empty! Safe! Opens up (7, 0) apple route below.\n- **LEFT to (6, 2):** \u2705 Empty! Safe! Moving towards center, cutting enemy's right-side access.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 2):** \u274c DEAD! That's my OLD head position where I just came from - my tail will move forward into it this turn.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (4, 6) - they're hunting apples in the top-left while I'm positioned on the right side. They have DOUBLE my score (8 vs 4), so I NEED to start closing the gap FAST. The apple at (7, 0) is RIGHT BELOW ME - that's free real estate!\n\n**WHY I'M GOING DOWN:**\n1. **FREE APPLE ALERT:** (7, 0) apple is just two moves away! I can eat it next turn and start closing the 8-4 deficit.\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (7, 1) I can pivot left to (6, 1), down to (7, 0) for the apple, or even right to (8, 1) if needed.\n3. **ENEMY TRACKING:** Enemy is too far left to contest this apple. They're busy with their own game in the top-left quadrant.\n4. **SPACE MANAGEMENT:** Down gives me more room to maneuver and set up my next apple hunt.\n5. **RISK MITIGATION:** Going LEFT to (6, 2) is safe but doesn't get me any closer to points. I need to start eating!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 0) on turn 16, then use my increased length to start positioning aggressively for the apple at (5, 0) or push towards the center to cut off the enemy's expansion routes. I need to start eating NOW or this game is over before it begins! Once I get 2-3 more apples, I can start playing head-on collision games when I'm closer to their score.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE HUNGRY AND WE'RE GOING DOWN TO GET IT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

That means I'm already at the apple location? Let me verify the timeline...\n\nActually, looking at the board:\n- My head: (7, 0)\n- My body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)]\n- There's an apple at (7, 0) in the board state!\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If I moved DOWN to (7, 0) last turn and there's an apple there, I should have eaten it and grown. But the apple list shows (7, 0) as a drop. Let me re-examine...\n\nActually, looking at the board again more carefully:\n- Row 0: \". . . . . A . 1 . A\"\n- The \"1\" at position 7 is ME - my head is at (7, 0)\n- The apple at (7, 0) would be where I am now\n\nBUT there's confusion. The apple list shows (7, 0) as an apple drop. If I'm standing on it, I must have just eaten it this turn? No wait, turns happen simultaneously.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The board shows me at (7, 0) and an apple at (7, 0). That's impossible unless I just moved there and the apple is still there (meaning I didn't eat it). But that contradicts the rules - if I move onto an apple, I grow and the apple disappears.\n\nActually, re-reading: The board state shown is BEFORE my move this turn (Turn 17). My head is at (7, 0) from last turn's move DOWN. The apple at (7, 0) in the board state means I'm currently on an apple? That seems wrong.\n\nLet me look at the apple drops again: \"(7, 0)\" is listed. And in the board:\nRow 0: \". . . . . A . 1 . A\"\nPosition 7 has \"1\" (me), position 5 has \"A\", position 9 has \"A\".\n\nOH! The apple at (7, 0) is NOT showing on the board because I'm standing there! The apple list shows it was a drop, but I must have just eaten it when I moved to (7, 0) last turn. That's why I'm at (7, 0) and there's no \"A\" at that position - because I ate it!\n\nSo my score should be 5 now (was 4, ate one apple). And the apple at (7, 0) is gone.\n\nNow for Turn 17, I'm at (7, 0) with body [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)].\n\nLet me check my options from (7, 0):\n- UP to (7, 1): That's my own body! DEAD!\n- DOWN to (7, -1): Off board! DEAD!\n- LEFT to (6, 0): Check board - row 0, col 6 is \".\" (empty). SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): Check board - row 0, col 8 is \".\" (empty). SAFE.\n\nSo my only safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2, 6) with body going right. They're not close to me.\n\nWhere are the apples? Looking at the board and apple list:\n- (0, 5): row 5, col 0 - shows \"A\" on board\n- (5, 0): row 0, col 5 - shows \"A\" on board  \n- (1, 9): row 9, col 1 - shows \"A\"\n- etc.\n\nFrom (7, 0):\n- LEFT to (6, 0), then maybe LEFT again to (5, 0) to eat apple at (5, 0)\n- RIGHT to (8, 0), then I'm at edge (col 9 is max), so RIGHT from (8, 0) would be (9, 0) which has an apple! But wait, (9, 0) is the edge, I can move there.\n\nLet me check (9, 0): Row 0, col 9 shows \"A\" - there's an apple!\n\nSo from (7, 0):\n- LEFT path: (6, 0) \u2192 (5, 0) [apple!] \u2192 maybe (4, 0) or (5, 1) or back\n- RIGHT path: (8, 0) \u2192 (9, 0) [apple!] \u2192 then stuck at edge, only LEFT or UP\n\nActually, if I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I can then go to (9, 0) to get the apple. But then I'm at the corner (9, 0) and my next move options would be limited to LEFT (back to 8,0) or UP (to 9,1).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 0), I can get to (5, 0) for the apple. From (5, 0), I could go UP to (5, 1) which is empty (row 1, col 5 is \".\"), giving more flexibility.\n\nWhich is better? Let's think long-term. The RIGHT path gives me an apple quickly but traps me in the corner. The LEFT path gives me an apple and more board control.\n\nAlso, I should consider enemy movement. Enemy is at (2, 6) with a long tail. They might move toward center or down. But they're far away.\n\nMy score is 5, enemy is 10. I need apples fast! Both paths have apples equally close (2 moves away: (5,0) or (9,0)).\n\nBut (9,0) is a corner - risky. From (9,0) I can only go LEFT or UP. UP to (9,1) is empty (row 1, col 9 is \".\"), so actually it's not terrible. But I'd be at the edge.\n\nFrom (5, 0), I have more options: (4,0), (5,1), (6,0). That's 3 options vs 2 from corner.\n\nI think LEFT is better for board control. Let me go LEFT to (6, 0) and set up for the apple at (5, 0).\n\nActually wait, let me double-check the board for row 0:\n\". . . . . A . 1 . A\"\nCol 0: \".\"\nCol 1: \".\"\nCol 2: \".\"\nCol 3: \".\"\nCol 4: \".\"\nCol 5: \"A\" (apple at 5,0)\nCol 6: \".\"\nCol 7: \"1\" (me at 7,0)\nCol 8: \".\"\nCol 9: \"A\" (apple at 9,0)\n\nYes, so (6,0) and (8,0) are both empty.\n\nI'll go LEFT to (6, 0) to set up for the apple at (5, 0). This gives me more flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move left toward apple at (5,0). After eating it, I'll have length 7 and can pivot up toward center or continue left. The enemy is in the top-left, so I'll dominate the bottom-right and cut off their expansion. They're at 10 apples, I need to close this gap fast!",

Let's break down this turn! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My head is at (8, 0) after moving RIGHT last turn (I think there was some confusion in the recap, but the current board shows me at (8,0))\n- My body: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)]\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (2, 7) with a long tail stretching rightward\n- I have 5 apples vs their 11 - HUGE deficit! I need to play AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis from (8, 0):**\n- **UP to (8, 1):** Check board - row 1, col 8 is \".\" (empty). SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (8, -1):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (7, 0):** That's my own body! (first element in my body list). DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (9, 0):** Check board - row 0, col 9 has \"A\" - APPLE! SAFE. \u2705\n\nSo my only SAFE moves are UP or RIGHT!\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **RIGHT to (9, 0):** This gets me an apple immediately! That's +1 score, growth, and I'm in the corner. From (9,0) I can go UP to (9,1) or LEFT back to (8,0). Corner play is risky but I get an apple NOW.\n- **UP to (8, 1):** This is safe but doesn't get an apple. From (8,1) I can explore more options. But I'm missing the apple at (9,0)!\n\n**The CRITICAL Factor:** My score is 5 vs enemy's 11! I'm DOWN 6 apples! I need EVERY apple I can get RIGHT NOW! The apple at (9,0) is literally ONE move away - I'd be throwing if I don't take it! \n\n**Enemy Prediction:** They're at (2,7) with a long body. They might move RIGHT toward (3,7) or UP to (2,8). Either way, they're far from me. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term Consideration:** Yes, the corner is limiting, but with 5 segments I can maneuver. I'll get the apple, grow to 6, then immediately go UP to (9,1) to get out of the corner. The apple at (9,9) might be worth pursuing next since I'm already on the right edge.\n\n**VERDICT:** GO RIGHT! Get that apple at (9,0)! I need to close the score gap IMMEDIATELY! AGGRESSIVE PLAY! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating at (9,0), I'll go UP to (9,1) to stay mobile, then work my way toward the center or chase apples at (9,9) or (5,0). The enemy is in the top-left - I'll dominate the right side!\n\nRIGHT",

DEAD! \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (8,0):** That's my own body - first element in my list. DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,0):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\nWAIT! Actually looking at the board again... row 0, col 9 shows \"1\" (that's ME). The apple is gone from (9,0) after I ate it last turn! So I'm NOT at (8,0) anymore, I'm still at (9,0) because I grew! My body should now extend behind me.\n\nLet me reconsider: The board shows row 0, col 9 as \"1\" - that's my current position. The apple at (9,0) was eaten. So my head is at (9,0) and I need to move FROM there.\n\n**Re-evaluating moves from (9,0):**\n- **UP to (9,1):** Board shows \"T\" at (9,1) - enemy tail! That's SAFE! Moving into a tail is fine (it moves away after I arrive). \u2705\n- **LEFT to (8,0):** Check board row 0, col 8: shows \"T\" - enemy tail! Also safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT/ DOWN:** Off board - DEAD!\n\nSo both UP and LEFT are viable! \n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n- **UP to (9,1):** Gets me closer to top-right where there's an apple at (9,9). Also moves me away from the enemy who's in the top-left.\n- **LEFT to (8,0):** Moves me toward the center but I'm cornered if I go deeper left.\n\nGiven my aggressive playstyle and being down 6 apples, I need to stay mobile and chase apples. The (9,9) apple is 9 steps away on the right edge - I can chase it! Going UP keeps me on the edge but mobile.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP to (9,1)! Get off the absolute corner, stay mobile, and start hunting the (9,9) apple! Let's close that score gap! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Plan:** After moving to (9,1), I'll work my way UP toward (9,9) while watching the enemy's position.

Let's do some CALCULATIONS! \ud83d\udd25 We're at (9,1) and the map is looking CRISP! \n\n**Current Status:** Turn 20, my head at (9,1), score 6 vs enemy 13. That's a 7-apple gap - NOT GOOD! But we're still in this!\n\n**Critical Update:** I just moved UP from (9,0) to (9,1) last turn, and the board shows \"T\" at (9,1) - that's the enemy tail! It's moving away this turn! SAFE! \u2705\n\n**Evaluating moves from (9,1):**\n- **UP to (9,2):** Board shows row 2, col 9 = \"T\" - enemy tail! Still safe, but I'm getting TRAPPED in the corner! Risky long-term. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN to (9,0):** I just came from there! My body will be there! CRASH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,1):** Off board! DEAD! \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (8,1):** Board shows row 1, col 8 = \"T\" - enemy tail! SAFE! And this is KEY - I'm moving AWAY from the dead-end corner! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC GENIUS:** Going LEFT from (9,1) puts me at (8,1) - STILL on the edge but NOT cornered! I can then go UP toward the apple at (9,9) OR go LEFT to (7,1) and explore the center! \n\n**Tactical Advantage:** The enemy is clustered in the bottom-left (around 4,7 to 9,7). By going LEFT from (9,1), I'm moving parallel to their edge, keeping distance while staying mobile. If I go UP, I'm just climbing up a dead-end wall!\n\n**Chat, we need AGGRESSION but SMART aggression!** Going LEFT keeps my escape routes OPEN. I can always pivot up later. But if I go UP now and get trapped, it's GG! \n\n**VERDICT:** LEFT to (8,1)! Stay mobile, avoid the corner trap, and keep options open to dominate the board! Let's goooo! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf\n\n**Long-term Plan:** From (8,1), I'll assess the board. If the enemy commits left, I can go UP and chase (9,9). If they move right toward me, I can retreat to (7,1) and cut through the center. FLEXIBILITY IS KEY!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I need to cut ACROSS the board to intercept!\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** Going LEFT to (7,1) puts me closer to the CENTER! From there I can:\n1. Go UP toward (7,3) where there's an apple at (5,2) \n2. Cut diagonally toward the enemy's position\n3. Control the middle of the board!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** I'm going to SLICE through the center! The enemy is distracted eating apples top-left. I'll grab the apples in rows 2-3, build my length, then CHASE them down! If I get to 7+ apples and they're at 13, I need to force a head-on collision when I have the size advantage!\n\n**VERDICT:** LEFT to (7,1)! Moving toward the center, keeping options OPEN, and setting up to dominate the middle of the board! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf\n\nLEFT",
