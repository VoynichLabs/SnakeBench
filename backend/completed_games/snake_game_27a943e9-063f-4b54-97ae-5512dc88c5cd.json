In upcoming moves we can then combine downward moves to adjust the y‑coordinate and further head RIGHT toward (4,7).\n\nOur move options from (1,8) are:  \n– UP: moves to (1,9) (away from our target apple)  \n– DOWN: moves to (1,7) (also moves toward (4,7) by lowering y)  \n– RIGHT: moves to (2,8) (increases x while keeping y, setting up further moves)  \n– LEFT: would reverse into our tail, which isn’t advisable.\n\nBetween moving RIGHT (to (2,8)) and DOWN (to (1,7)), either is acceptable since each yields a Manhattan distance of 3 from (4,7).

UP → (4,9): This is safe (inside the board) and would put us on the top row. From there, the apple (6,9) is 2 cells to the right. However, being on the top row means fewer “escape” options if we need to adjust.\n2. RIGHT → (5,8): This is also safe. It gets us closer horizontally to (6,9), leaving us with a Manhattan distance of 2 (|6–5| + |9–8| = 1 + 1) and keeps us away from the top boundary.\n3. DOWN → (4,7): That cell is occupied by our own body, so it’s not an option.\n4. LEFT → (3,8): While unoccupied and safe, it moves away from our target apple.\n\nSince both UP and RIGHT lead us toward (6,9) in about three moves, the RIGHT move is preferable. Moving RIGHT from (4,8) gives us (5,8) and maintains our flexibility without immediately tying us to the top border. We can then, in subsequent moves, go UP (or adjust as needed) toward the apple.\n\nThus, my planned strategy is:\n1. Move RIGHT to (5,8) – approaching apple (6,9) while keeping options open.\n2.

(8, 5) - up and right\n5. (0, 7) - far left and up\n\nStrategy analysis:\n- I'm at (6, 0) after successfully moving right\n- There are three apples aligned vertically above me at x=6\n- Enemy snake is far to the left, not an immediate threat\n- Moving down would be out of bounds\n- Moving left would be risky due to obstacles\n- Moving right would take me away from the vertical line of apples\n- Moving up is clear and leads directly to three apples\n\nThe best move here is clearly UP because:\n1) It starts my path toward three aligned apples (6, 3), (6, 4), and (6, 7)\n2) It's a safe move with no immediate obstacles\n3) Staying on this vertical line gives me access to multiple apples\n4) Maintains good distance from the enemy snake\n\nFor next turn:\n- Will continue moving up to reach the first apple at (6, 3)\n- Need to watch for any enemy snake movement toward this area\n- May need to plan an escape route after collecting these apples\n\nUP",
