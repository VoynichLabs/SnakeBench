From my current spot, moving UP to (5,7) positions me toward both (5,9) and (4,7) in the next steps, while preserving flexibility for escapes. Moving LEFT to (4,6) would also be fine and set up a direct move to (4,7) next, but UP keeps me more centralized and aligned with higher-utility apples.\n\nPlan short-term: head toward the closest reachable apples (prefer (4,7) or (5,9)) and avoid getting into dead ends or tight spaces. Since there is no immediate risk, selecting UP maintains good future options and keeps me on track to collect apples sooner.\n\nUP",

No apple is present at (8,0), but moving RIGHT clears the current cell and opens up space for future growth while keeping multiple subsequent moves possible.\n\nPlan: Continue extending to the right when safe, watch the opponent's head trajectory, and aim to capture apples that are currently at (9,0) and (9,1) which are reachable after a few right moves. Avoid moving upward until the body behind me no longer occupies (7,1).\n\nRIGHT",
