Grabbing it gives an immediate point and increases my length by 1, while still leaving multiple escape options (up, down, right) on the next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- After eating at (5,6), head toward nearby apple clusters (notably those around the 7th and 8th rows) while keeping space to avoid traps. Watch enemy movement from the lower-left quadrant and avoid head-on confrontations.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, looking at board: row 0 column 2 is \u2018A\u2019 (apple). Yes, so (2, 0) has an apple. No snake body there. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 0) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \n- Closest apple: (2, 0) is directly left. Eating it would grow to length 2 next turn.  \n- Other apples: (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 2), etc.  \n\n**Enemy snake considerations:**  \nEnemy at (6, 6) is far away, no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Future flexibility:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 0) and eat apple, my body will be at (3, 0) next turn, head at (2, 0). From (2, 0), possible moves: UP to (2, 1) \u2013 apple there but also safe? Check board: (2, 1) is apple, no snake there. That\u2019s fine. Also could go RIGHT back to (3, 0) but that\u2019s my body next turn so that would kill me. So from (2, 0), safe moves would be UP or DOWN (down is off board) or LEFT (to (1, 0), empty). So UP and LEFT safe. That\u2019s 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3, 1): no apple, but from there next turn I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT maybe. More options.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 0): no apple, from there next turn can go UP, RIGHT, DOWN? DOWN to (4, -1) off board, so actually UP, RIGHT safe, LEFT back to (3, 0) safe (still no body). So 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nEat apples early to get longer and have more control. The apple at (2, 0) is safe to take now. Eating it also puts me closer to other apples at (2, 1), (1, 2), etc.  \n\nLEFT seems best: immediate apple, still safe follow-up options.  \n\n**Rationale for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 0), my body will be at (3, 0). Next turn avoid moving back into (3, 0). Consider moving toward (2, 1) apple if safe, else toward center. Keep enemy snake\u2019s possible moves in mind later.  \n\nLEFT",

There is no nearby enemy head threat, so a safe, flexible approach toward the apple cluster is preferable.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- From (5,7) try to take (5,8) or (4,7) depending on enemy movement.\n- After collecting, prefer routes that preserve open space toward the upper-right cluster (7,7),(8,6),(7,8).\n- Keep an eye on enemy movements from lower-left and avoid head-on collisions or tight corridors.\n\nUP",

It is far from me (distance 5+), no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Future flexibility:**  \nIf I go UP to (2, 2): next turn body will be [(2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0)], head at (2, 2). From there, possible moves: UP (2, 3) empty, LEFT (1, 2) apple, RIGHT (3, 2) empty, DOWN (2, 1) my body \u2192 death.

From there: UP (1, 2) apple, LEFT (0, 1) empty, RIGHT (2, 1) my body \u2192 death, DOWN (1, 0) empty.

If I go UP now, I can go LEFT next turn to (1, 2) and eat it. If I go LEFT now, I can go UP next turn to (1, 2) and eat it. Both are equally good in terms of reaching that apple in two turns. However, going UP now leaves me at (2, 2), which keeps more central position and avoids being too close to left edge (0 column).

(3, 4) is close and reachable in two moves via RIGHT then UP or UP then RIGHT.  \nMove UP this turn to (2, 4), then next turn evaluate moving RIGHT to (3, 4) to eat apple, unless enemy threatens.  \nAlternatively, moving RIGHT now to (3, 3) sets up eating (3, 4) next turn as well.  \nUP gives slightly more central position, away from left edge.  \nLEFT moves toward left edge, reducing options later.  \nGiven enemy is far, I prefer UP for flexibility.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

UP to (6,4) safe, DOWN to (6,2) safe, LEFT to (5,3) body, RIGHT to (7,3) safe \u2192 3 safe.  \n\nLEFT gives fewer safe follow-ups (2). DOWN and RIGHT give 3 each.  \n\n**Avoiding potential traps:**  \nMy body occupies (5,4),(4,4),(3,4),(2,4),(2,3). Moving RIGHT opens space toward board center and many apples (6,6),(7,7),(8,4),(9,5). Moving DOWN goes toward apple (4,2) but may box me near bottom-left corner later.  \n\n**Enemy future threat:**  \nEnemy may eat (1,9) or (1,7) and grow. It will be farther from central apples for now.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN and RIGHT are equally safe and give good mobility. DOWN gets me closer to apple (4,2) next turn. RIGHT moves toward more apples in long run.  \nGiven my lead (5 vs 4 apples), I should play safe and maintain mobility while targeting nearest apple.  \n\nDOWN to (5,2) \u2192 next turn I can go LEFT to (4,2) for apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,2), if apple at (4,2) still there, go LEFT to eat it. Otherwise consider RIGHT toward (6,6) or (7,7) area, avoiding enemy path. Keep tail space in mind \u2014 my tail at (2,3) will move to (2,4) next turn if I don\u2019t grow.  \n\nDOWN",

Possible moves: UP to (1,6) its own body \u2192 suicide, DOWN to (1,4) safe, LEFT to (0,5) safe (apple there), RIGHT to (2,5) safe. It will likely avoid suicide, so could go LEFT to apple (0,5) or DOWN/right.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,2), enemy could go RIGHT to (2,5)? No, (2,5) is not adjacent to (1,5). From (1,5), enemy can go RIGHT to (2,5), which is not my target (2,2).

I want to collect (1,2) next turn if possible, but must ensure enemy doesn\u2019t cut me off. From (2,2), I can go LEFT to (1,2) if enemy not there. Enemy could reach (1,2) in 2 turns from (1,5) via (1,4)\u2192(1,3) or (0,5)\u2192(0,4)\u2192(0,3) etc. I can get there in 1 move from (2,2).

Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (5,0) could move UP to (5,1) or RIGHT to (6,0) or LEFT to (4,0) or DOWN invalid. So enemy cannot reach (5,6) in one move. So UP is safe from immediate death.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,4): that\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). That\u2019s suicide. Eliminate.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,5): not off-board, not my body (my body has (4,1), not (4,5)), not enemy body. Enemy head at (5,0) cannot reach (4,5) in one move. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,5): not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves**  \nEnemy head at (5,0): possible moves: UP to (5,1) \u2013 but (5,1) is my body (my tail end), so enemy would die if they go UP. LEFT to (4,0) \u2013 that\u2019s their own body (second segment), so suicide. RIGHT to (6,0) \u2013 empty cell. DOWN invalid (off-board). So enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (6,0).  \n\nKnowing enemy will move RIGHT means next turn enemy head at (6,0). That means enemy will be moving along bottom row toward right side.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options**  \n\nApples closest to my possible moves:  \n\n- UP to (5,6): apples at (5,7) above, (6,6) to right-up, (4,8) left-up, (7,6) far-right.  \n- LEFT to (4,5): nearest apple is (3,5) to left, (4,8) up-left, (6,6) far-right-up.  \n- RIGHT to (6,5): nearest apple is (6,6) up, (7,6) right-up, (5,7) up-left.  \n\nFrom (5,6): next turn safe moves likely: UP to (5,7) apple, LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6) apple. That\u2019s good options.  \n\nFrom (4,5): next turn safe moves: UP to (4,6), LEFT to (3,5) apple, RIGHT to (5,5) (empty now), DOWN to (4,4). Also good.  \n\nFrom (6,5): next turn safe moves: UP to (6,6) apple, LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5), DOWN to (6,4). Also good.  \n\nAll three safe moves give good future options.  \n\nBut consider enemy\u2019s path: enemy moving RIGHT along bottom means they\u2019ll be at (6,0), then maybe (7,0), etc. They are far from me now, so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nThe board\u2019s right side has many apples: (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (9,7), (9,8), (7,7), (7,8), etc. Moving UP or RIGHT now gets me closer to that cluster.  \n\nLEFT toward (3,5) apple is fine but fewer apples in left side overall.  \n\nGiven scores tied at 7 apples each, I should aim for the denser apple region while staying safe.  \n\nUP seems slightly better because:  \n1. From (5,6) I can go to (5,7) apple next turn if safe.  \n2. Also opens path to (6,6) apple after.  \n3. Avoids moving toward left where my long body trail is (blocking some leftward expansion).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check for any hidden danger**  \nCould enemy move RIGHT to (6,0) and then next turn move UP to (6,1) and eventually threaten me? Possibly, but I\u2019ll be at y=6 or higher, far from them for many turns.  \n\nAlso, my body occupies bottom left area, so moving UP leaves my body as a barrier between me and enemy\u2019s possible upward movement later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice**  \nI\u2019ll choose **UP**.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,6), check if (5,7) apple is safe (no enemy collision risk). If safe, go UP to eat it and grow. If unsafe (enemy could reach?), consider RIGHT to (6,6) apple or LEFT to (4,6) to keep options open. Monitor enemy head position (likely (6,0) next turn).  \n\nUP",

Suicide. Eliminate.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,6): on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,6): on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n\nAll three safe moves avoid immediate death.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves**  \nEnemy head at (6,0): possible moves:  \nUP to (6,1) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT to (5,0) \u2013 its own body (second segment). Suicide.  \nRIGHT to (7,0) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN invalid (off-board).  \nSo enemy safe moves: UP to (6,1), RIGHT to (7,0).  \n\nEnemy could move UP toward apples later, but currently far from me (y=0 vs my y=6).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options**  \n\nFrom (5,6):  \n- UP to (5,7): apple at (5,7) \u2192 eat immediately, grow, score 8.  \n- LEFT to (4,6): nearest apple is (3,5) or (4,8).  \n- RIGHT to (6,6): apple at (6,6) \u2192 eat immediately, grow, score 8.  \n\nEating an apple now would tie the score at 8 apples each (enemy has 7 now, but could also eat one this turn).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Check for head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy safe moves: (6,1) or (7,0). Neither conflicts with my possible moves (5,7), (4,6), (6,6). So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after eating**  \nIf I eat apple at (5,7): new head at (5,7), body grows by 1, so tail stays at (3,1) for now. Next turn my body will occupy (5,6),(5,5),...,(3,1). From (5,7), safe moves likely: UP to (5,8) empty, LEFT to (4,7) empty, RIGHT to (6,7) empty. Good options.  \n\nIf I eat apple at (6,6): new head at (6,6), body grows. From (6,6), safe moves: UP to (6,7) empty, LEFT to (5,6) (occupied by my new body segment next turn? Wait: if I move RIGHT to (6,6), my old head leaves (5,6), but my body shifts: new head at (6,6), previous head (5,6) becomes first body segment, so (5,6) is my body next turn. Then from (6,6), LEFT to (5,6) would be suicide next turn. So eating at (6,6) reduces future options because (5,6) becomes my body. Safer to eat (5,7) because (5,6) remains behind me as body, but (6,6) remains free for later.  \n\nAlso, enemy moving up may approach right side apples later. I should secure apples while keeping space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nRight side has many apples: (7,6), (7,7), (8,6), (9,7), (9,8), etc. Moving UP to (5,7) keeps me central and allows rightward movement next turn toward that cluster. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also gets an apple but blocks immediate left move next turn.  \n\nGiven tied scores, securing an apple now is good. UP to (5,7) is slightly better because:  \n1. Immediate apple.  \n2. Next turn from (5,7) I can go RIGHT to (6,7) toward more apples, or UP to (5,8), or LEFT to (4,7).  \n3. Avoids making (5,6) a body cell that would trap me if I later need to move left from (6,6).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Final choice**  \nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to eat apple at (5,7).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,7), check enemy head position. Likely safe moves: UP to (5,8), RIGHT to (6,7), LEFT to (4,7). Prefer RIGHT toward apple cluster at (7,6),(7,7),(8,6) if safe. Monitor enemy movement along bottom/right edge.  \n\nUP",

          "move": "DOWN",
          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down.  \n\n**Current head:** (7, 7)  \n**My body:** [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]  \n**Enemy head:** (8, 1)  \n**Apples:** many, especially on right side (columns 6\u20139).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check for each move from (7,7):**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 8): empty on board (apple at (7,8)? Yes, board shows A at (7,8) \u2014 so eating apple there). Not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 6): empty on board (apple at (7,6)? Yes, board shows A at (7,6)). Not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 7): my own body segment (6,7) is second in my body list \u2014 lethal.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 7): empty on board (no apple at (8,7)? Board shows '.' at (8,7)). Not my body, not enemy body.  \n\nSo LEFT is lethal. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and possible head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (8,1) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1) (its own body at (7,1)? Actually (7,1) is enemy body? Wait \u2014 enemy body: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]. Yes, (7,1) is its own body, so LEFT is lethal for enemy.)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1) (apple at (9,1), but board shows apple at (9,1) \u2014 yes.)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: UP, RIGHT, maybe DOWN (down is (8,0) \u2014 empty? Board shows '.' at (8,0), yes, but (8,0) not occupied by any body? Enemy body ends at (2,0), so (8,0) is free. So DOWN is safe for enemy too.)  \n\nCheck my destinations vs enemy\u2019s possible destinations this turn:  \n- My UP (7,8) vs enemy\u2019s possible moves: none are (7,8).  \n- My DOWN (7,6) vs enemy: none are (7,6).  \n- My RIGHT (8,7) vs enemy: none are (8,7).  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple access:**  \nUP: eats apple at (7,8) \u2192 grow by 1, score +1.  \nDOWN: eats apple at (7,6) \u2192 grow by 1, score +1.  \nRIGHT: no apple at (8,7).  \n\nSo UP and DOWN give immediate points.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \nAssume I eat apple, so my tail stays where it is (grow by 1, so body length increases, tail doesn\u2019t move).  \n\n**If UP to (7,8):**  \nNext turn from (7,8), possible moves:  \n- UP (7,9): empty? Board shows '.' at (7,9) \u2014 yes.  \n- DOWN (7,7): currently my neck at (6,7) will move forward? Wait \u2014 after move UP, my body will be [(7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), ...]. So (7,7) will be my second segment next turn, so DOWN into (7,7) is lethal.  \n- LEFT (6,8): empty? Board shows '.' at (6,8) \u2014 yes.  \n- RIGHT (8,8): empty? Board shows '.' at (8,8) \u2014 yes.  \n\nSo from (7,8) next turn, DOWN is lethal (into own new body), but UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe (check enemy later). That\u2019s 3 safe moves.  \n\n**If DOWN to (7,6):**  \nAfter eating apple, body: [(7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), ...].  \nFrom (7,6) next turn:  \n- UP (7,7): lethal (own body).  \n- DOWN (7,5): empty? Board shows '.' at (7,5).  \n- LEFT (6,6): apple at (6,6) \u2014 but is it empty? Yes, apple cell not occupied by body.  \n- RIGHT (8,6): apple at (8,6) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo UP lethal, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe = 3 safe moves.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (8,7):**  \nNo apple eaten, body shifts: [(8,7), (7,7), (6,7), ...], tail (4,1) gone (since no growth).  \nFrom (8,7) next turn:  \n- UP (8,8): empty.  \n- DOWN (8,6): apple at (8,6) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT (7,7): lethal (own body).  \n- RIGHT (9,7): apple at (9,7) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo LEFT lethal, others safe = 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo all three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic positioning:**  \nWe want to maximize apple collection safely. Enemy is far away at bottom.  \nRight side has cluster: (8,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (7,8), (7,6), (6,6).  \n\nIf I go UP to (7,8), I eat apple there, next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,8) or LEFT to (6,8) \u2014 both safe but may not lead to immediate apple.  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,6), I eat apple there, next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,6) or DOWN to (7,5) or LEFT to (6,6) \u2014 all apples nearby.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,7), no apple now, but next turn from (8,7) I can go DOWN to (8,6) or RIGHT to (9,7) \u2014 both apples.  \n\nBut going RIGHT delays eating by 1 turn, while UP/DOWN eat now. Since we want to reach 30 apples fastest, eating now is better.  \n\nBetween UP and DOWN:  \n- UP (7,8): puts me near top-right cluster, but my body forms vertical wall at x=5, so going UP then RIGHT keeps me in apple-rich zone.  \n- DOWN (7,6): also in apple-rich zone, with (6,6), (8,6) nearby.  \n\nBut check board: from (7,6), LEFT to (6,6) is apple, DOWN to (7,5) no apple. From (7,8), LEFT to (6,8) no apple, RIGHT to (8,8) no apple, UP to (7,9) no apple. So DOWN gives more immediate apples next turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy may move up toward apples at (9,1), (8,4), etc., but still far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid potential dead ends:**  \nNo tight traps evident yet.  \n\nGiven enemy is distant, I\u2019ll choose DOWN to eat apple now and position to eat (6,6) or (8,6) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,6), likely go LEFT to (6,6) for apple, or RIGHT to (8,6) for apple, depending on enemy position. Keep moving in right-side cluster. Monitor enemy progress upward.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (9, 1)**  \nEnemy body: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP (9, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN (9, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT (8, 1): its own body \u2192 lethal.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 lethal.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP or DOWN. Neither reaches my possible destinations (7, 5), (6, 6), (8, 6). No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple access**  \nLEFT (6, 6): eats apple.  \nRIGHT (8, 6): eats apple.  \nDOWN (7, 5): no apple.  \n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT give immediate +1 apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \nAssume I eat apple (grow by 1, tail stays).  \n\n**If LEFT to (6, 6):**  \nBody becomes [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), \u2026]  \nFrom (6, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (6, 7): my own body (4th segment) \u2192 lethal.  \n- DOWN (6, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT (5, 6): my body? (5, 6) is in my body list currently but will shift forward? After move, body segments shift: (5, 6) becomes 5th segment \u2192 lethal.  \n- RIGHT (7, 6): my own body (second segment) \u2192 lethal.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe \u2192 bad future mobility.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (8, 6):**  \nBody becomes [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), \u2026]  \nFrom (8, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 6): my own body (second segment) \u2192 lethal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 6): empty (no apple shown, but board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (9,6)?

Moving LEFT yields no immediate apple and puts me closer to the opponent\u2019s body, increasing risk of being cut off.\n- DOWN and RIGHT are impossible.\n\nTactical choice:\n- Take the guaranteed apple at (9,5). This keeps me on the rich right column of apples (9,7 and 9,8 ahead) and gains an immediate point.

Enemy\u2019s body includes (9,3) currently, but enemy moves now \u2014 if enemy moves UP or LEFT, (9,3) might be empty next turn. But if enemy goes UP to (9,5), (9,3) is tail?

Actually enemy body now: [(9,4), (9,3), (9,2), \u2026]. If enemy moves UP, new head (9,5), body: [(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), \u2026] so (9,3) still occupied. So RIGHT to (9,3) is lethal next turn if I\u2019m at (8,3). So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (7,4):**  \nBody: [(7,4), (8,4), (8,5), \u2026] tail disappears.  \nFrom (7,4) next turn:  \nUP (7,5): empty currently, but check my body: (7,5) not in my future body? Wait, my body after moving LEFT: head (7,4), then (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), \u2026 So (7,5) is free.  \nDOWN (7,3): empty.  \nLEFT (6,4): empty.  \nRIGHT (8,4): my own body (second segment) \u2192 lethal.  \nSo next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,4):**  \nBody: [(9,4), (8,4), (8,5), \u2026] tail disappears.  \nFrom (9,4) next turn:  \nUP (9,5): apple, possibly enemy there now? If enemy went UP to (9,5), then lethal (head-on). If enemy went LEFT to (8,4), then (9,5) empty. So risky.  \nDOWN (9,3): enemy body segment? As before, enemy body will still have (9,3) occupied after their move (since they grow only if they eat apple at (9,5)). So DOWN lethal.  \nLEFT (8,4): my own body (second segment) \u2192 lethal.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 lethal.  \nSo next turn possibly only UP safe, and only if enemy not there. Very risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid risk, keep options**  \nRIGHT leads to possible death next turn.  \nDOWN leaves only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT leaves 3 safe moves next turn and avoids enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI have a lead (12 vs 9 apples). Avoid enemy proximity. Move toward open area and apples on left side soon ((6,6), (4,7), (4,3), etc.). From (7,4) next turn, I can go UP to (7,5) toward (6,6) apple or LEFT/DOWN to safer zones.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (7,4) \u2014 safest, most future options, no immediate apple but maintains flexibility.  \n\nLEFT",

No, after moving UP, body becomes [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), ... tail (5,5)] so (4,3) is occupied \u2192 lethal.  \nLEFT (3, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 4): empty.  \nTwo safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2192 actually three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). DOWN is lethal. Yes, three safe moves.\n\n**DOWN to (4, 2):**  \nFrom (4, 2) next turn:  \nUP (4, 3): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nDOWN (4, 1): empty.  \nLEFT (3, 2): empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 2): empty.  \nThree safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n**LEFT to (3, 3):**  \nFrom (3, 3) next turn:  \nUP (3, 4): empty.  \nDOWN (3, 2): empty.  \nLEFT (2, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 3): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nThree safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**\n\nUP (4, 4): no apple directly.  \nDOWN (4, 2): no apple directly.  \nLEFT (3, 3): no apple directly.  \n\nClosest apples: (3, 5) is 2 away from (4, 3), (4, 7) is 4 away, (3, 7), (6, 6), (7, 5).  \nFrom (4, 4): closer to (3, 5) maybe.  \nFrom (3, 3): closer to (3, 5) as well.  \nFrom (4, 2): farther from most apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat**\n\nEnemy head (8, 8): possible moves:  \nUP (8, 9): empty.  \nDOWN (8, 7): empty.  \nLEFT (7, 8): empty.  \nRIGHT (9, 8): its body? Actually (9, 8) is its old head? Wait, enemy body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), ...] so (9, 8) is its second segment now? No, recheck: enemy head is (8, 8), body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), ...]. So RIGHT to (9, 8) is into its own body \u2192 lethal. So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nFrom (8, 8), UP (8, 9) near apple (7, 8), DOWN (8, 7) near apple (7, 8)?? Actually (7, 8) is apple. LEFT (7, 8) is apple. So enemy likely to go for apple at (7, 8) via LEFT or DOWN. If enemy goes LEFT to (7, 8), eats apple, grows, stays north.  \n\nDistance from enemy to me: currently (8, 8) vs (4, 3) \u2192 5 in x, 5 in y \u2192 far. No immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**\n\nAll three safe moves give three safe next moves, so no immediate trap.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**\n\nI have 13 apples vs enemy 12. I'm ahead by 1. No need to rush into risky apple chase. Better to stay safe, keep distance from enemy, maintain mobility.  \n\nLEFT to (3, 3) opens path toward left-side apples ((1, 6), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 5) above).  \nUP to (4, 4) heads toward center and top apples but also closer to enemy area eventually.  \nDOWN to (4, 2) heads toward bottom apples but fewer apples there except (0, 3), (1, 2).\n\nEnemy is long (length 13) and mostly on right/top area. Staying left seems safer for now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose move**\n\nUP: slightly closer to enemy area long-term but fine.  \nDOWN: safe but fewer apples.  \nLEFT: safe, toward more apples left side, away from enemy.\n\nLEFT seems best for both safety and apple access.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3, 3), avoid RIGHT back to (4, 3). Prefer UP to (3, 4) or LEFT to (2, 3) to explore left side apples while monitoring enemy movement toward (7, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Enemy body: [(7, 8), (8, 8), \u2026] \u2192 yes, (7, 8) is its own body segment \u2192 lethal.  \nLEFT (6, 9): empty (apple at (6, 9) actually).  \nRIGHT (8, 9): empty.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: LEFT to (6, 9) (apple), RIGHT to (8, 9).  \nEnemy might go LEFT toward apple (6, 9) or RIGHT away from wall.  \nDistance from enemy to my position: (7, 9) to (3, 4) is far (\u0394x=4, \u0394y=5). No immediate collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Avoiding dead ends\n\nUP \u2192 safe, gets apple, keeps 3 follow-ups.  \nLEFT \u2192 safe, keeps 3 follow-ups.  \nRIGHT \u2192 only 2 follow-ups, slightly riskier.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan\n\nWe want to stay ahead in apples while keeping escape routes.  \nUP gets apple now, moves toward top-center where apples at (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (2, 8) are nearby afterward.  \nLEFT moves toward left side apples (1, 6), (0, 3), (1, 2), etc., but less dense.  \n\nGiven scores tied, taking an apple now puts pressure on enemy. Enemy might go for (6, 9) apple, but that\u2019s far from us.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Decision\n\nUP is safe, gains apple, maintains good future options.  \nLEFT is safe but no immediate gain.  \nRIGHT reduces future options.  \n\nBest move: **UP** to (3, 5) for apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 5), consider UP to (3, 6), LEFT to (2, 5), or RIGHT to (4, 5). Avoid DOWN into (3, 4). Keep an eye on enemy movement toward (6, 9) apple.\n\nUP",

Safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n**LEFT to (2, 5):**  \nFrom (2, 5): UP (2, 6) empty, DOWN (2, 4) empty, LEFT (1, 5) empty, RIGHT (3, 5) my body \u2192 lethal. Safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 5):**  \nFrom (4, 5): UP (4, 6) apple, DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) my body \u2192 lethal, RIGHT (5, 5) empty. Safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe follow-ups.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (6, 9). Enemy safe moves:  \nUP (6, 10) off board \u2192 lethal.  \nDOWN (6, 8) empty.  \nLEFT (5, 9) empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 9) its own body \u2192 lethal.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5, 9), still far from me.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6, 8), still far.  \nNo immediate collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term board positioning**  \nMy snake currently occupies middle-left vertical column. Moving UP continues toward top-center apple cluster while staying near left wall for escape routes. Moving RIGHT goes toward center where enemy\u2019s tail is near (7, 0) but enemy head is far top-right.  \nUP seems good because:  \n- Gets me closer to multiple apples quickly.  \n- Keeps distance from enemy head.  \n- Avoids trapping myself in left side dead-end later.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nAll three moves are equally safe next-turn. UP positions me best for upcoming apple grabs at (3, 7) and nearby. LEFT heads toward less dense area. RIGHT goes toward center but near enemy tail zone.  \nI\u2019ll choose **UP**.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3, 6), consider UP to (3, 7) apple, LEFT to (2, 6), or RIGHT to (4, 6) apple. Avoid DOWN into (3, 5). Monitor enemy movement toward (6, 9) apple\u2014if enemy eats it, scores tie at 15 each.\n\nUP",

DOWN is feasible but funnels us toward a cramped area with several enemy segments nearby, increasing the chance of getting trapped or colliding in subsequent turns.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Continue left along y=9 to contest or take the apple at (1,9).

Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 6): Apple present, not occupied by my body or enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety analysis**  \n**If UP to (3, 7):**  \nBody will be [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), \u2026].  \nFrom (3, 7):  \nUP (3, 8) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (3, 6) \u2013 my new body \u2192 lethal.  \nLEFT (2, 7) \u2013 apple, empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 7) \u2013 apple, empty.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n**If LEFT to (2, 6):**  \nBody will be [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), \u2026].  \nFrom (2, 6):  \nUP (2, 7) \u2013 apple, empty.  \nDOWN (2, 5) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (1, 6) \u2013 apple, empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 6) \u2013 my body \u2192 lethal.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).\n\n**If RIGHT to (4, 6):**  \nBody will be [(4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), \u2026].  \nFrom (4, 6):  \nUP (4, 7) \u2013 apple, empty.  \nDOWN (4, 5) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (3, 6) \u2013 my body \u2192 lethal.  \nRIGHT (5, 6) \u2013 empty.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe follow-ups next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nCurrent apples: (1, 9), (6, 6), (4, 8), (3, 7), (0, 3), (1, 2), (4, 7), (1, 6), (7, 5), (0, 4), (2, 8), (3, 0), (2, 7), (4, 6), (8, 3).  \nFrom head (3, 6):  \n- UP (3, 7): apple immediately eaten.  \n- LEFT (2, 6): no apple, but close to (2, 7), (1, 6), (2, 8).  \n- RIGHT (4, 6): apple immediately eaten.  \n\nUP and RIGHT eat an apple this turn, LEFT doesn\u2019t. Eating sooner is good (race to 30 apples), but must also consider safety after eating (growth means tail moves slower).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (5, 9). Enemy safe moves from (5, 9):  \nUP (5, 10) off board \u2192 lethal.  \nDOWN (5, 8) empty.  \nLEFT (4, 9) empty.  \nRIGHT (6, 9) its own body \u2192 lethal.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5, 8), still far from me. If enemy goes LEFT to (4, 9), still far.  \nNo immediate collision risk for me at (3, 7), (2, 6), or (4, 6).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nMy tail end is at (6, 7), so board is getting crowded near my body in middle-right area. Moving RIGHT into (4, 6) eats apple but pushes me toward center where enemy\u2019s long body wraps around right side. Moving UP to (3, 7) eats apple and stays near left side, giving more open space on left columns for future moves. LEFT to (2, 6) doesn\u2019t eat apple now but keeps left-side options open.  \n\nGiven scores tied at 14 each, eating an apple now could give me lead. But also need to avoid trapping myself. UP to (3, 7) leaves me with UP (3, 8), LEFT (2, 7 apple), RIGHT (4, 7 apple) next turn \u2014 very good options. RIGHT to (4, 6) leaves me with UP (4, 7 apple), DOWN (4, 5), RIGHT (5, 6) \u2014 also good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Tiebreaker thinking**  \nEnemy could eat (4, 8) or (2, 8) soon from (5, 9). I want to secure apples before they do.  \n(3, 7) is close to enemy? Enemy at (5, 9) \u2192 distance 2 squares in x, 2 in y, so not immediate threat.  \nActually, if I go UP to (3, 7) and enemy goes LEFT to (4, 9), enemy is still 2 away next turn. Safe.  \n\nUP seems slightly better than RIGHT because:  \n- After eating at (3, 7), my next head position is farther from enemy head (5, 9 \u2192 3, 7) than if I go RIGHT to (4, 6) (enemy at 5, 9 \u2192 4, 6 is closer).  \n- Both eat an apple, but UP keeps me nearer left wall escape routes.  \n\nLEFT doesn\u2019t eat apple now, which could let enemy gain apple lead if they eat one.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP: eat apple, safe next moves, good positioning.  \nRIGHT: eat apple, safe next moves, slightly closer to enemy head.  \nLEFT: no apple, safe but gives up immediate score gain.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to eat (3, 7) and keep lead.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3, 7) and eating apple, my new head will be at (3, 7), body longer by 1 (tail stays at (6, 7) until moves). Next turn safe moves: UP to (3, 8) empty, LEFT to (2, 7) apple, RIGHT to (4, 7) apple. Avoid DOWN to (3, 6) my body. Monitor enemy head movement from (5, 9) \u2014 if enemy eats (4, 8) or (2, 8), scores could tie again at 15 each. Try to claim (2, 7) or (4, 7) next turn to extend lead.\n\nUP",

No enemy head can reach (4,8) this turn (enemy head at (3,7) cannot move two cells), and (4,8) is not occupied by any snake body. Eating now both increases our score and gives us more length to maneuver.\n- LEFT is safe and would pursue the top-row apple at (1,9), but it\u2019s slower and gives the opponent time to maneuver. Given we are one apple behind, taking the immediate apple is preferable.\n- There is some risk of getting closer to the enemy-dense area if we continue downward later; after taking (4,8) I will prefer to either chain the vertical apples (4,7 then 4,6) if safe, or retreat left/up to maintain space and avoid the clustered enemy body around x=6..8,y=3..7.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Eat (4,8) now.

DOWN is lethal.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety analysis**  \n\n**If UP to (3, 8):**  \nBody becomes: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7)] (tail at (6, 7) stays until we move).  \nFrom (3, 8):  \nUP (3, 9): empty, safe.  \nDOWN (3, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nLEFT (2, 8): apple, empty now.  \nRIGHT (4, 8): apple, empty now.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**If LEFT to (2, 7):**  \nBody: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), \u2026].  \nFrom (2, 7):  \nUP (2, 8): apple, empty.  \nDOWN (2, 6): empty.  \nLEFT (1, 7): empty, no apple.  \nRIGHT (3, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (4, 7):**  \nBody: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), \u2026].  \nFrom (4, 7):  \nUP (4, 8): apple, empty.  \nDOWN (4, 6): apple, empty.  \nLEFT (3, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nRIGHT (5, 7): empty.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe follow-ups next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples nearby:  \n- LEFT (2, 7) \u2013 apple there \u2192 eat immediately.  \n- RIGHT (4, 7) \u2013 apple there \u2192 eat immediately.  \n- UP (3, 8) \u2013 no apple.  \n\nEating an apple increases my lead (15 vs enemy\u2019s 14).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (4, 9).  \nFrom (4, 9):  \nUP (4, 10) off board \u2192 lethal.  \nDOWN (4, 8): apple, empty.  \nLEFT (3, 9): empty, no apple.  \nRIGHT (5, 9): enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 lethal.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 8), eats apple, ties score at 15 each. If enemy goes LEFT to (3, 9), no apple eaten yet.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3, 8), enemy at (4, 9) could go DOWN to (4, 8) and eat apple, tying score.  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 7), I eat an apple and lead 16 vs 14 or 15.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nSimultaneous moves:  \n- Enemy possible moves: (4, 8) or (3, 9).  \n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 7), enemy could go DOWN to (4, 8) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go LEFT to (2, 7), enemy nowhere near.  \n- If I go UP to (3, 8), enemy could go LEFT to (3, 9) \u2192 adjacent, not same cell.  \n\nNo head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nMy tail at (6, 7) will move eventually. Body occupies middle-right area.  \nLEFT (2, 7) moves me toward left side, more open space there.  \nRIGHT (4, 7) moves me closer to enemy\u2019s long body wrapping around right side (enemy tail at (8, 1), body along bottom-right).  \nUP (3, 8) keeps me central but no immediate apple.  \n\nGiven scores: I have 15, enemy 14. Eating an apple now gives me 16, enemy max 15 if they eat one too. That\u2019s good.  \n\nLEFT (2, 7) eats apple, moves away from enemy, leaves options open.  \nRIGHT (4, 7) eats apple, moves closer to enemy body area.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tiebreaker**  \nLEFT and RIGHT both eat apple, both safe next moves = 3 options.  \nLEFT seems slightly better because:  \n- Enemy\u2019s possible next head positions are (4, 8) or (3, 9). From (2, 7), I\u2019m farther from (4, 8) or (3, 9) than if I were at (4, 7).  \n- LEFT also positions me to potentially grab (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 8) apples soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (2, 7) and eating apple, my new head at (2, 7), body longer by 1 (tail stays at (6, 7) until moves). Next turn safe moves likely UP (2, 8 apple), DOWN (2, 6 empty), LEFT (1, 7 empty). Avoid RIGHT (3, 7) my body. Watch enemy head movement \u2014 if enemy ate (4, 8), scores 16 vs 15. Try to claim (2, 8) or (1, 6) next turn to extend lead.  \n\nLEFT",

RIGHT is lethal.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety for each option**  \n\n**If UP to (2, 8)** \u2013 eat apple, grow by 1, tail stays at (6, 7) for now.  \nNew head at (2, 8). Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), \u2026].  \nFrom (2, 8):  \nUP (2, 9): empty, safe.  \nDOWN (2, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nLEFT (1, 8): empty, safe.  \nRIGHT (3, 8): empty, safe.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**If DOWN to (2, 6)** \u2013 no apple eaten, tail moves from (6, 7) to (7, 7)? Wait: tail is last segment (6, 7). When no apple eaten, tail moves forward one cell along body path. Let\u2019s trace: body currently ends at (6, 7), before that is (7, 7), so tail will move to (7, 7) and body shifts. So new body: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), \u2026 (7, 7)].  \n\nFrom (2, 6):  \nUP (2, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nDOWN (2, 5): empty, safe.  \nLEFT (1, 6): apple, safe.  \nRIGHT (3, 6): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nSafe follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**If LEFT to (1, 7)** \u2013 no apple eaten, tail moves to (7, 7) again.  \nBody: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), \u2026 (7, 7)].  \nFrom (1, 7):  \nUP (1, 8): empty, safe.  \nDOWN (1, 6): apple, safe.  \nLEFT (0, 7): empty, safe.  \nRIGHT (2, 7): my body \u2192 lethal.  \nSafe follow-ups: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nSo UP gives 3 safe next moves, DOWN gives 2, LEFT gives 3.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apples and score**  \nApples nearby:  \n- UP (2, 8): apple \u2192 eat now, score 17 vs enemy 15 (if enemy eats one).  \n- LEFT (1, 7): no apple.  \n- DOWN (2, 6): no apple.  \n\nEating now extends my lead to 17 vs 15 max for enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy head at (4, 8)** after last turn? Wait, enemy head was at (4, 9) last turn, they moved simultaneously with me. They could have moved DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 9). But we don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s check board:  \nBoard shows \u20180\u2019 at (4, 8)? Actually board row 8: \u201c. . A . 0 A . T T T\u201d \u2192 yes, enemy head at (4, 8) now. So enemy ate apple at (4, 8), their score is 15 now (was 14). So scores: me 16, enemy 15.  \n\nFrom enemy head (4, 8):  \nUP (4, 9): empty, safe.  \nDOWN (4, 7): apple, safe.  \nLEFT (3, 8): empty, safe.  \nRIGHT (5, 8): apple, safe.  \nAll four moves safe for them.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nIf I go UP to (2, 8), enemy could go LEFT to (3, 8) \u2192 not same cell, adjacent though.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 7), enemy far.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6), enemy far.  \n\nNo direct head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future options**  \nUP (2, 8) eats apple, leads to area near apples at (1, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3), etc.  \nLEFT (1, 7) doesn\u2019t eat apple but keeps 3 safe moves next turn and puts me near apples at (1, 6), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3).  \nDOWN (2, 6) only 2 safe moves next turn, less flexible.  \n\nBetter to eat apple now to extend lead.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose**  \nBetween UP and LEFT: UP eats apple, same safe follow-ups count (3). UP also moves away from enemy head (4, 8) slightly more than LEFT? Actually LEFT is farther in x-direction. But eating apple is priority.  \n\nEnemy could move to (4, 7) apple or (5, 8) apple next turn, possibly tying score if I don\u2019t eat now. So eat now.  \n\nUP seems best: immediate apple, good future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (2, 8), head at (2, 8), body longer by 1. Next turn safe moves: UP (2, 9), LEFT (1, 8), RIGHT (3, 8). Avoid DOWN (2, 7) my body. Try to claim (1, 9) or (3, 9) apples soon. Keep an eye on enemy head movement \u2014 they have many options from (4, 8).  \n\nUP",

Wait, enemy moves simultaneously, so (4, 8) might be empty next turn if enemy moves away, or occupied by enemy body if enemy moves forward. But enemy head is at (5, 8) now? Let\u2019s check board:  \nEnemy head at (5, 8)? Wait, board row 8: \u201c. . 1 . T 0 . T T T\u201d \u2192 col 5 is \u20180\u2019, so enemy head at (5, 8). Yes, I misread earlier.  \nSo (4, 8) currently enemy body (segment after head). After enemy moves, (4, 8) will be enemy body unless enemy grows. But enemy might eat apple at (4, 7) or (5, 8) apple? Actually (5, 8) is enemy head now, so apple at (5, 8)? Board shows \u20180\u2019 at (5, 8), not \u2018A\u2019. So no apple there. Enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (5, 8), UP (5, 9): empty, DOWN (5, 7): apple at (5, 6)? Actually (5, 7) empty, LEFT (4, 8): currently his own body (4, 8) from last turn \u2192 lethal for him, so he won\u2019t choose LEFT. RIGHT (6, 8): empty. So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (5, 9), his body leaves (4, 8) occupied? No, his body shifts, so (4, 8) becomes free if he doesn\u2019t grow. But he might eat apple at (4, 7) if he moves DOWN to (5, 7)? Wait, DOWN from (5, 8) is (5, 7), not (4, 7). So he can\u2019t reach (4, 7) in one move.  \nSo (4, 8) could be free next turn if enemy moves away and didn\u2019t grow last turn. But checking: enemy\u2019s body includes (4, 8) currently (second segment). If enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT without eating apple, his tail moves, so (4, 8) becomes empty. If enemy eats apple, his tail stays, so (4, 8) remains occupied. So uncertain.  \n\nThus RIGHT to (3, 8) then next turn RIGHT to (4, 8) could be lethal if enemy stays there. But next turn from (3, 8), RIGHT to (4, 8) is risky. Other moves from (3, 8): only UP safe, DOWN and LEFT lethal. So from (3, 8) only UP definitely safe, RIGHT risky. So only 1 safe move guaranteed.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apples nearby**  \nApples visible:  \n- (1, 9) \u2013 reachable from (1, 8) next turn if I go LEFT now.  \n- (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), etc.  \n\nGoing LEFT now gives access to more apples soon. Going UP now gives fewer options next turn (only LEFT or RIGHT from (2, 9)).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy proximity**  \nEnemy head at (5, 8). From there he can go UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), RIGHT (6, 8). He might go for apple at (4, 7) but can\u2019t reach in 1 move. Apple at (5, 6) is 2 moves away.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8), I\u2019m farther from enemy. If I go RIGHT to (3, 8), I\u2019m closer, but not same cell.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose**  \nLEFT gives 3 safe next moves, UP gives 2 safe next moves, RIGHT gives 1 safe move (UP only). So LEFT is best for flexibility. Also LEFT positions me to get (1, 9) apple next turn if safe.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nCould enemy go to (1, 8) same time I go LEFT? From (5, 8), impossible in 1 move. So safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter LEFT to (1, 8), next turn safe moves: UP (1, 9) apple, DOWN (1, 7) empty, LEFT (0, 8) empty. Choose based on enemy position then, aiming for apples while keeping options open.  \n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (1, 7): empty, no apple, not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (0, 8): empty, no apple, within board. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (2, 8): occupied by my own body (first segment). Lethal.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety and apple access:**  \n- **UP**: Eat apple at (1, 9), score becomes 18. Next turn from (1, 9), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe (UP off board, DOWN into body). This may lead to limited options along the top edge.  \n- **DOWN**: No apple now. Next turn from (1, 7), safe moves are DOWN to (1, 6) (apple) and LEFT to (0, 7). This positions me to collect the apple at (1, 6) next turn and keeps me in an area with multiple apples (left side).  \n- **LEFT**: No apple now. Next turn from (0, 8), safe moves are UP to (0, 9) and DOWN to (0, 7), both edge cells with no immediate apples, potentially restricting future mobility.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy considerations:**  \nEnemy head at (5, 7) has safe moves to apples at (4, 7) or (5, 6). They will likely grow this turn. Going DOWN keeps me away from the enemy and maintains my apple lead (17 vs. their potential 17 if they eat an apple). Going UP increases my lead to 18 but risks getting trapped along the top.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN provides the best balance: it avoids immediate traps, sets up for an apple next turn at (1, 6), and keeps me in a region rich with apples (left side). It also maintains distance from the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 7), prioritize going DOWN to (1, 6) to eat the apple, unless enemy movement makes it risky. Alternatively, LEFT to (0, 7) is a safe fallback. Monitor enemy head position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

No overlap with (1, 6).  \n- If I go LEFT to (0, 7), enemy could go anywhere above, no overlap.  \n\nSo no head-on collision threat this turn with either move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each safe move**  \n\n**Option DOWN to (1, 6)**:  \nFrom (1, 6):  \n- UP: (1, 7) \u2192 my old head position, now empty (body moved forward), but my new body segment will be at (1, 6) after eating apple (since I grow), so next turn my body will be: head at (1, 6), then (1, 7), then (1, 8), etc. Wait, careful:  \nIf I eat apple at (1, 6), I grow by 1 segment. So after this turn, my body length increases by 1. The new tail end stays same, head moves to (1, 6), body list becomes:  \nHead (1, 6) + old body (1, 7) + rest of old body from (1, 8) onward. So (1, 7) will be my second segment next turn.  \nThus UP from (1, 6) next turn goes to (1, 7) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 lethal next turn.  \n- DOWN: (1, 5) \u2192 empty, no apple currently, safe.  \n- LEFT: (0, 6) \u2192 empty, no apple, safe.  \n- RIGHT: (2, 6) \u2192 empty, no apple, safe.  \n\nSo from (1, 6) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Option LEFT to (0, 7)**:  \nFrom (0, 7):  \n- UP: (0, 8) \u2192 empty, no apple, safe.  \n- DOWN: (0, 6) \u2192 empty, no apple, safe.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 lethal.  \n- RIGHT: (1, 7) \u2192 will be my body segment next turn (since my body follows). Yes, if I go LEFT now, my body moves: head to (0, 7), then body segments shift: old head (1, 7) becomes second segment. So RIGHT from (0, 7) next turn goes to (1, 7) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 lethal.  \n\nSo from (0, 7) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN only. Worse mobility (edge trap).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apples and scoring**  \nApples at: (1, 6) is apple, (0, 7) no apple.  \nEating apple now increases my score to 18 vs enemy\u2019s 17. That\u2019s good for tie-breaking.  \nAlso, enemy likely eats apple this turn too (they have two reachable apples at (4, 6) and (6, 6)), so they\u2019ll be at 18 as well if they take one.  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now, they could pull ahead if they eat apple and I don\u2019t.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nGoing DOWN to (1, 6) gives apple now and keeps me away from the top edge trap. From (1, 6), I can go to (0, 6) or (2, 6) or (1, 5) next turn, all safe and toward other apples (e.g., (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 2) nearby).  \n\nGoing LEFT to (0, 7) avoids apple now, risks being stuck on left edge with fewer options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is clearly better:  \n- Immediate safe.  \n- Gets apple now.  \n- Better next-turn mobility.  \n- Avoids edge trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6) after eating apple, avoid UP (into own body). Prefer DOWN to (1, 5) or LEFT to (0, 6) to stay safe and target apples at (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 2). Monitor enemy head position to avoid future head-on collisions.  \n\nDOWN",

Edge trap risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Option RIGHT to (2, 6)**:  \nFrom (2, 6):  \n- UP: (2, 7) \u2192 occupied by my body (4th segment: (2, 7)) \u2192 lethal next turn.  \n- DOWN: (2, 5) \u2192 empty, no apple.  \n- LEFT: (1, 6) \u2192 occupied by my body next turn \u2192 lethal next turn.  \n- RIGHT: (3, 6) \u2192 occupied by my body (6th segment: (3, 6)) \u2192 lethal next turn.  \n\nSo from (2, 6) next turn, only safe move: DOWN. Very bad.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apples and scoring**  \nApples nearby:  \n- (1, 4) is apple, reachable if I go DOWN now to (1, 5), then DOWN next turn to (1, 4).  \n- (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 2), (4, 2), (6, 0), etc.  \n\nEnemy will likely take apple at (4, 7) this turn, bringing them to 19 apples vs my 18. I need to eat soon to keep up.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nRIGHT to (2, 6) leads to dead end next turn (only DOWN safe). Avoid.  \nLEFT to (0, 6) leads to edge trap (only UP/DOWN safe).  \nDOWN to (1, 5) gives 3 safe moves next turn and paths toward apples (1, 4), (0, 4), (1, 2), etc.  \n\nAlso, enemy at (4, 6) may move UP to (4, 7) for apple, then next turn could threaten (4, 6) area, but I\u2019m far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is clearly best:  \n- Immediate safe.  \n- Best next-turn mobility (3 safe moves).  \n- Sets up for apple at (1, 4) next turn.  \n- Avoids edge/dead-end traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), avoid UP into (1, 6) (own body). Prefer DOWN to (1, 4) for apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to open space. Monitor enemy head after they likely move to (4, 7) or (4, 5).  \n\nDOWN",

LETHAL.  \n- DOWN: (4, 4) \u2192 empty, no apple.  \n- LEFT: (3, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body (my 8th segment: (3, 5)).

Wait, eating means I grow by 1 segment next turn, but the tail doesn\u2019t move this turn? Actually in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow: your head moves to apple cell, your body follows but tail stays in place (you don\u2019t move the tail that turn). So after move DOWN, my body will be: head (1, 4), then old head (1, 5), then old (1, 6), etc., length increases by 1.  \n\nFrom (1, 4) next turn:  \n- UP: (1, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body (second segment). LETHAL next turn.  \n- DOWN: (1, 3) \u2192 empty, no apple.  \n- LEFT: (0, 4) \u2192 apple present, empty now.  \n- RIGHT: (2, 4) \u2192 empty, no apple.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\n---\n\n**Option LEFT to (0, 5)**:  \nFrom (0, 5) next turn:  \n- UP: (0, 6) \u2192 empty, no apple.  \n- DOWN: (0, 4) \u2192 apple present, empty now.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 lethal.  \n- RIGHT: (1, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body next turn (old head). LETHAL.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN only (edge trap).  \n\n---\n\n**Option RIGHT to (2, 5)**:  \nFrom (2, 5) next turn:  \n- UP: (2, 6) \u2192 occupied by my body (old head position (1, 6)?? Wait, my body segments shift: after moving to (2, 5), body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), \u2026]. So (2, 6) is empty next turn? Let\u2019s check: current body: (1, 6), (1, 7), \u2026 After moving head to (2, 5), body becomes: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), \u2026 So (2, 6) is free. So UP safe.  \n- DOWN: (2, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT: (1, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body next turn (second segment). LETHAL.  \n- RIGHT: (3, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body (segment (3, 5) stays in place). LETHAL.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN only (2 safe moves).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apples and scoring**  \nApple at (1, 4) is immediate if I go DOWN. That brings me to 19 apples, tying enemy if they don\u2019t eat this turn (they have no immediate apple reachable unless they go RIGHT to (5, 5) which has no apple). Actually enemy\u2019s safe moves: (4, 4) no apple, (5, 5) no apple. So enemy likely not eating this turn unless they take a risk into (3, 5) which is my body (lethal for them). So I can get ahead in apples this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nLEFT (0, 5) gives only 2 safe moves next turn and edge trap.  \nRIGHT (2, 5) gives only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN (1, 4) gives 3 safe moves next turn and immediate apple, and opens path to more apples at (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 2), etc.  \n\nAlso, enemy at (4, 5) might move RIGHT to (5, 5), moving away from me, reducing collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is best:  \n- Immediate safe.  \n- Immediate apple (tie-breaker advantage).  \n- Best next-turn mobility (3 safe moves).  \n- Avoids edge trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 4), avoid UP into (1, 5) (own body). Consider LEFT to (0, 4) for another apple, or DOWN/rightward to open space. Watch enemy head position after their move.  \n\nDOWN",

But edge trap is dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nLEFT (0, 4) gives apple but traps me on left edge with only 2 safe moves.  \nRIGHT (2, 4) gives no apple and only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN (1, 3) gives no apple now but 3 safe moves next turn and access to apples at (1, 2), (0, 3), (4, 2), etc., while staying flexible.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (5, 5), moving likely RIGHT/DOWN away from me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN seems best for mobility and future safety.  \nLEFT gives apple but risks getting trapped on edge.  \nRIGHT gives neither apple nor good mobility.  \n\nI choose **DOWN** to keep options open and avoid edge trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 3), consider eating apple at (1, 2) or (0, 3), but watch enemy movement. Keep at least 2 safe moves after each step. Avoid boxing myself in.  \n\nDOWN",

More central flexibility.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term strategy**  \nI lead 20-19 in apples. Want to increase lead safely. DOWN sets up easy apple at (0, 1) next turn while keeping 3 safe moves now. LEFT risks edge trap. RIGHT delays apple consumption. DOWN also allows movement toward bottom apples (e.g., (3, 0)) if needed.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN provides best balance: safe, good next-turn options, and sets up an apple grab to extend lead. Avoid LEFT due to edge trap.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 1), consider:  \n- LEFT to (0, 1) to eat apple and grow (but then be at edge; plan exit via RIGHT afterward).  \n- RIGHT to (2, 1) to maintain central mobility.  \n- DOWN to (1, 0) to approach bottom apples.  \nAssess enemy position and avoid traps.  \n\nDOWN",

So safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #0 position and possible moves**  \nEnemy head: (7, 7)  \nIts possible moves:  \nUP to (7, 8) \u2013 empty? Wait, board shows (7,8) is part of enemy body (from earlier body list: (7,8) is in snake #0\u2019s body? Let\u2019s check body list: snake #0 body: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,5), \u2026 (7,8)? Actually (7,8) is not in body list given; body list: (7,6), (6,6), \u2026, (7,9), (7,8)? Let\u2019s scan: given body: (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5). Yes, (7,8) is in body list (index 14). So UP from (7,7) to (7,8) is into its own body \u2014 lethal for enemy. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN to (7,6) \u2014 its own body? Wait (7,6) is first element of its body (neck) \u2014 that\u2019s lethal (can\u2019t move backwards). Actually in Snake rules, moving into your own body segment directly behind head is lethal. (7,6) is directly behind head? Head at (7,7), body[0] = (7,6) \u2014 yes, that\u2019s the neck. So DOWN to (7,6) is lethal. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: LEFT to (6,7) \u2014 empty? Board shows (6,7) is \u2018.\u2019 (from legend). RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: LEFT (6,7) and RIGHT (8,7).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate head-on collision risk**  \nMy possible moves coordinates: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), RIGHT (3,1).  \nEnemy possible moves coordinates: (6,7), (8,7).  \nNo overlap, so no immediate head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (1,9), (0,3), (4,7), (7,5), (0,4), (3,0), (8,3), (0,1), (6,0), (0,7), (4,2), (4,4), (8,1), (8,0), (3,2).  \nFrom (2,1):  \n- UP (2,2): closer to (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (0,4) eventually.  \n- DOWN (2,0): closer to (3,0), (6,0), (8,0).  \n- RIGHT (3,1): not directly onto apple, but opens path to (4,2), (3,0), etc.  \n\n(3,2) is apple 1 step away if UP then RIGHT next turn.  \n(3,0) is apple 2 steps away if DOWN then RIGHT next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom each safe move:  \n- UP to (2,2): possible next moves: UP (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,2) my body? (1,2) is my body (from list: body[2] = (1,2)), so lethal. RIGHT (3,2) apple, DOWN (2,1) my body? That\u2019s neck (previous head position), lethal. So from (2,2), only safe moves next turn would be UP (2,3) and RIGHT (3,2) (apple). That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, but (3,2) is apple, eating it gives length +1 but may reduce mobility after.  \n- DOWN to (2,0): next moves: LEFT (1,0) empty, RIGHT (3,0) apple, UP (2,1) neck lethal. So 2 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (3,1): next moves: UP (3,2) apple, DOWN (3,0) apple, RIGHT (4,1) empty, LEFT (2,1) neck lethal. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nRIGHT gives most options next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid traps long-term**  \nWe\u2019re tied 20\u201320 apples. Need to survive and outlast. RIGHT moves toward center, keeps more options. UP or DOWN lead to fewer options next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT maximizes future safe moves and moves toward apples (3,2) or (3,0) next turn while avoiding immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,1), assess apples at (3,2) and (3,0) and enemy position. Likely go UP to (3,2) to eat apple unless enemy threatens that cell.  \n\nRIGHT",

Board shows (8,6) is \u2018.\u2019  \n- LEFT (7, 7): enemy\u2019s own neck (body[0] = (7,7)), lethal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 7): enemy body at (9,7)? Body list: \u2026 (9,7) is in list (index 18). Yes, lethal.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (8, 6).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate head-on collision risk**  \nMy possible next head positions: (3,2), (3,0), (4,1)  \nEnemy\u2019s next head position: (8,6)  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nFrom (3,1):  \n- UP (3,2): apple immediately \u2192 eat, grow by 1, score 21.  \n- DOWN (3,0): apple immediately \u2192 eat, grow by 1, score 21.  \n- RIGHT (4,1): no apple.  \n\nEating an apple now gets me to 21 apples, enemy at 20. That\u2019s good for tie-breaking.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after eating apple**  \nIf I eat apple at (3,2): my body grows by 1, so my tail stays where it is (tail is at (7,3) currently). Next head position (3,2) \u2192 possible next moves from there: UP (3,3) is my body (segment (3,3) from body list), lethal. DOWN (3,1) is neck (old head), lethal. LEFT (2,2) empty? Board shows (2,2) is \u2018.\u2019 RIGHT (4,2) apple? Yes (4,2) is apple. So only safe moves from (3,2) next turn: LEFT (2,2) and RIGHT (4,2). That\u2019s 2 options, but (4,2) is apple \u2192 could eat again.  \n\nIf I eat apple at (3,0): next head position (3,0) \u2192 possible next moves: UP (3,1) neck lethal, DOWN off board (3, -1) lethal, LEFT (2,0) empty, RIGHT (4,0) empty. So only safe moves: LEFT (2,0) and RIGHT (4,0). That\u2019s 2 options, no apple adjacent.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,1): no apple, but next turn from (4,1) safe moves: UP (4,2) apple, DOWN (4,0) empty, LEFT (3,1) neck lethal, RIGHT (5,1) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn, one leads to apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of enemy cutting off future paths**  \nEnemy moving to (8,6) \u2014 far from me currently. No immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nWe both have 20 apples. Getting to 30 apples wins. Eating apples fast is good, but must avoid dead-ends.  \n\nUP to (3,2) gives apple now but next turn only 2 moves, one into another apple at (4,2). That could set up a chain eating apples along top-left area? But my body occupies many cells near (3,3), (2,3), etc., so mobility reduces quickly.  \n\nDOWN to (3,0) gives apple now but next turn only 2 moves, both no apple, and I\u2019m near bottom edge \u2014 risky if enemy later approaches.  \n\nRIGHT to (4,1) delays apple but keeps 3 options next turn, can then go UP to (4,2) for apple or explore rightward for more apples (e.g., (7,5), (8,3)).  \n\nGiven scores tied, eating an apple now puts me ahead, which is valuable for win conditions. Between UP and DOWN, UP seems slightly better because next turn I can eat another apple at (4,2) and maybe move toward center.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll take UP to (3,2) to eat apple, go to 21 apples, and next turn decide between LEFT (2,2) or RIGHT (4,2) \u2014 probably RIGHT to (4,2) for another apple if safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,2), assess enemy position. Likely go RIGHT to (4,2) to eat apple unless enemy threatens that cell.  \n\nUP",

No.  \n- Is (4, 1) occupied by enemy body? Checking Snake #0 body: no.  \n- Is it within board? Yes (0\u20139).  \n- Is it a possible head-on collision? Enemy head is at (8, 5). Enemy could move DOWN to (8, 4) or other, not reaching (4, 1) in one step.  \n- Does it have an apple? Apples list: (4, 1) not in list. So no apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Check RIGHT to (5, 2):**  \n- Is (5, 2) occupied by my body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (8, 5) cannot reach (5, 2) in one move.  \n- Apple at (5, 2)? No.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n**After DOWN to (4, 1):**  \nAdjacent cells:  \n- UP back to (4, 2) \u2192 occupied by my old head? No, but after moving down, my body will shift: new head (4, 1), neck (4, 2), tail moves forward. Wait \u2014 let\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent body: head (4, 2), neck (3, 2), then (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), \u2026 tail (7, 3).  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 1):  \nNew body: head (4, 1), neck (4, 2), then (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), \u2026 tail (6, 3) \u2014 actually tail is last segment (7, 3) removed unless apple eaten. No apple eaten, so tail removed. So (7, 3) disappears, (6, 3) becomes new tail.  \n\nCheck moves from (4, 1):  \nUP to (4, 2) \u2192 occupied by my neck? Yes (4, 2) will be my neck after move \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT to (3, 1) \u2192 occupied by my body? Yes, (3, 1) is part of my body (3, 1) after shift? Let\u2019s check: after move, body is: (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), \u2026 So (3, 1) is the 4th segment \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT to (5, 1) \u2192 free? Yes, not in my body or enemy body.  \nDOWN to (4, 0) \u2192 free? Yes, not occupied.  \n\nSo from (4, 1), only 2 safe moves: RIGHT and DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**After RIGHT to (5, 2):**  \nNew body: head (5, 2), neck (4, 2), then (3, 2), (3, 1), \u2026 tail (6, 3).  \n\nFrom (5, 2):  \nUP to (5, 3) \u2192 occupied by my body? Yes, (5, 3) is in current body (5th segment initially? Actually (5, 3) is in old body after shift? Let\u2019s check: old body has (5, 3) after (4, 3). After move, (5, 3) is still in body? Wait, shifting: new body: (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)\u2026 yes, (5, 3) is still in body (it\u2019s the last segment before tail removal? Actually tail is (7, 3) removed, so (6, 3) becomes tail, (5, 3) stays in body as second-to-last segment). So UP is into own body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN to (5, 1) \u2192 free? Yes, not occupied.  \nLEFT to (4, 2) \u2192 occupied by neck \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT to (6, 2) \u2192 free? Yes.  \n\nSo from (5, 2), only 2 safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (4, 1): nearest apples: (3, 0), (4, 4), (6, 0) \u2014 (3, 0) is close (down-left).  \nFrom (5, 2): nearest apples: (4, 4), (6, 4), (3, 0) \u2014 (4, 4) is closer? (4, 4) is 2 steps away (up-left), (6, 4) is 2 steps (up-right).  \n\nBoth have similar apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:** Snake #0 head at (8, 5), not an immediate threat to either (4, 1) or (5, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Tie-breaker:** Which move keeps more future options open?  \nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \nBut moving DOWN to (4, 1) puts me closer to bottom row where apples are at (3, 0), (6, 0), and away from enemy.  \nMoving RIGHT to (5, 2) keeps me more central.  \n\nGiven I have a lead (22 vs 20 apples), staying alive is key.  \n(4, 1) seems slightly safer because enemy is far and board is less cluttered near bottom left.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 1), likely go RIGHT to (5, 1) or DOWN to (4, 0) to pick up apple at (3, 0) or (6, 0). Avoid trapping myself. Keep distance from enemy snake\u2019s possible path.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

It keeps more follow-up options, moves toward the cluster of apples at x=8 (8,3 / 8,1 / 8,0), and avoids the tight trap that LEFT would create immediately after eating the apple at (7,5).\n\nShort plan: move to (8,4) this turn, then to (8,3) to grab that apple if safe.

RIGHT is more restrictive long-term.\n- After eating at (8,3) I will have multiple follow-up options (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN) and avoid getting immediately boxed in.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Take (8,3) now.

Remaining moves: DOWN and RIGHT  \n**DOWN** to (4, 0):  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? Scan body: (4, 0) not in body list \u2192 OK.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? Snake #0 body: not at (4, 0) \u2192 OK.  \n- Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (8, 4). Could enemy reach (4, 0) in one move? No (too far).  \n\n**RIGHT** to (5, 1):  \n- Within board?

Enemy at (8, 4) cannot reach (5, 1) in one move.  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple check  \nApples list: (1,9), (0,3), (4,7), (7,5), (0,4), (3,0), (8,3), (0,1), (6,0), (0,7), (4,4), (8,1), (8,0), (3,8), (6,4)  \n\n- **DOWN** to (4, 0): no apple.  \n- **RIGHT** to (5, 1): no apple.  \n\nNo immediate apple pickup.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each safe move  \n\n**If move DOWN to (4, 0):**  \nNew body: head (4, 0), neck (4, 1), then (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), \u2026 tail (6, 3) removed (no apple).  \n\nFrom (4, 0):  \n- UP to (4, 1) \u2192 occupied by neck \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT to (3, 0) \u2192 apple there! Not in my body (body: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), \u2026) \u2192 safe and gets apple next turn if we go there.  \n- RIGHT to (5, 0) \u2192 free (not in body or enemy).  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo from (4, 0), safe moves: LEFT (to apple) and RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**If move RIGHT to (5, 1):**  \nNew body: head (5, 1), neck (4, 1), then (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), \u2026 tail (6, 3) removed.  \n\nFrom (5, 1):  \n- UP to (5, 2) \u2192 free? Check body: (5, 2) not in new body \u2192 OK.  \n- DOWN to (5, 0) \u2192 free \u2192 OK.  \n- LEFT to (4, 1) \u2192 neck \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT to (6, 1) \u2192 free \u2192 OK.  \n\nSo from (5, 1), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Compare  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 0):**  \n- Next turn: 2 safe moves, one leads directly to apple at (3, 0).  \n- But (4, 0) is bottom row, limits upward movement because neck blocks UP.  \n\n**RIGHT to (5, 1):**  \n- Next turn: 3 safe moves, more options, no apple pickup now but can aim for (6, 0) or (4, 4) later.  \n- Keeps more flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy threat  \nEnemy head at (8, 4). From there, possible moves: UP to (8, 5), DOWN to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 4), RIGHT to (9, 4).  \nNowhere near (4, 0) or (5, 1) this turn.  \n\nBut next turn: if enemy moves toward center, (5, 1) is closer to enemy path than (4, 0). Still not in immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Decision  \nI have a slight lead (22 vs 20 apples). Safety first.  \nRIGHT gives more options next turn (3 moves vs 2 moves), so better for avoiding future traps.  \n\nApple at (3, 0) can be reached from (4, 0) via LEFT next turn, but from (5, 1) I could go DOWN to (5, 0) then LEFT to (4, 0) then LEFT to (3, 0) in two turns \u2014 still possible.  \n\nFlexibility now is valuable.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 1), consider going DOWN to (5, 0) to approach bottom row apples (3, 0) or (6, 0), or RIGHT to (6, 1) to approach (6, 4) or (6, 0). Avoid moving toward enemy head region (top right). Keep options open.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Yes.  \n  - In my body? No.  \n  - In enemy body? No.  \n  - Enemy head could reach (6,1)? No.  \n  \u2192 **Safe**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Apple proximity:**\n\nFrom (5,1):\n- UP to (5,2): no apple.\n- DOWN to (5,0): no apple (apple at (6,0) is one step away to the right).\n- RIGHT to (6,1): no apple.\n\nNo immediate apple pickup, but DOWN puts me one step from (6,0), RIGHT puts me one step from (6,4) via UP later.\n\n---\n\n**3. Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (5,2):**  \nFrom (5,2), possible next moves:  \n- UP to (5,3) \u2192 occupied by my body (tail) \u2192 illegal (will tail move? Without apple, tail at (5,3) will vanish next turn, but next turn's body list after moving UP now: head (5,2), neck (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), \u2026 tail (4,3) \u2014 wait, need to check: current body length 23 (22 apples + 1 head). Moving without apple means tail (5,3) disappears, new tail is (4,3). So (5,3) will be free next turn. But careful: after moving UP to (5,2), the body becomes: head (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), \u2026 (4,3) tail. So (5,3) is free.  \nActually, let's simulate:  \nCurrent body: (5,1) head, (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), \u2026 (5,3) tail.  \nMove UP: new head (5,2), add (5,1) as neck, rest shift, remove tail (5,3).  \nNew body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), \u2026 (4,3).  \nSo from (5,2):  \nUP (5,3) free, DOWN (5,1) neck illegal, LEFT (4,2) in body (yes, it's the 4th segment) \u2192 illegal, RIGHT (6,2) free.  \nSo from (5,2) only UP and RIGHT are safe next turn \u2014 2 options.\n\n**DOWN to (5,0):**  \nNew body: head (5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), \u2026 tail (4,3).  \nFrom (5,0):  \nUP to (5,1) neck illegal, DOWN off board illegal, LEFT (4,0) free, RIGHT (6,0) apple there and free.  \nSo safe: LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 2 options.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,1):**  \nNew body: head (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), \u2026 tail (4,3).  \nFrom (6,1):  \nUP (6,2) free, DOWN (6,0) apple and free, LEFT (5,1) neck illegal, RIGHT (7,1) free.  \nSo safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (8,3). Possible moves: UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3).  \nNowhere near me.  \nBut enemy could aim for apples at (7,5), (4,7), (3,8), (9,7).  \nFrom (6,1), I\u2019m closer to bottom row apples (6,0), (3,0), (0,1), etc.\n\n---\n\n**5. Strategic considerations:**  \nI have a 1-apple lead (22 vs 21). Game ends at 30 apples.  \nI want to avoid risky head-on collisions and aim for apples while keeping escape routes.  \nRIGHT gives best mobility (3 options next turn), and positions me to go DOWN to (6,0) apple next turn, or UP toward (6,4) later.  \nUP gives fewer options (2) and puts me closer to my long body \u2014 risk of boxing myself.  \nDOWN also gives 2 options but gets me closer to (6,0) apple next turn.\n\n---\n\n**6. Decision:**  \nRIGHT maximizes future options and is safe.  \nFrom (6,1) next turn, I can go DOWN to (6,0) to grab that apple, or move toward other apples.  \nAvoid trapping myself.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,1), consider DOWN to (6,0) to eat apple, then possibly LEFT toward (3,0) or (0,1) apples while keeping away from enemy\u2019s area (top right). Monitor enemy head movement.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down.  \n\n**Current head:** (6, 0)  \n**Body:** head \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 tail at (4,3).  \nSo neck is at (6,1).  \n\nPossible moves from (6,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 occupied by my own body segment (neck), so death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,-1) \u2192 off board, death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 empty on board? Let\u2019s check: board shows column 5, row 0: from diagram row 0:  \n   `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`  \n   `. . . A A . 1 . A .` at bottom row.  \n   So (5,0) is `.` means empty.  \n   Check if any snake occupies (5,0): my body list doesn\u2019t have it. Enemy snake #0 body list:  \n   (8,1),(8,2),\u2026 no (5,0). So safe? Wait, enemy head is at (8,1), not near (5,0).  \n   Also check collisions: enemy could move into (5,0)? They could move DOWN from (8,1) to (8,0), LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), RIGHT to (9,1). None are (5,0). So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 empty? Row 0 col 7: from board row 0 col 7 is `.`? Wait row 0:  \n   `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`  \n   `. . . A A . 1 . A .` \u2192 so col 7 is `.` between `1` and `A`. Yes empty.  \n   Check if enemy can move into (7,0): enemy at (8,1) can move DOWN to (8,0), LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), RIGHT to (9,1). No (7,0). So safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: LEFT to (5,0) and RIGHT to (7,0).  \n\n**Apples reachable:**  \nFrom (6,0):  \n- LEFT (5,0): no apple there (apple at (4,0), (3,0), (8,0), (0,3), etc.).  \n- RIGHT (7,0): no apple there.  \n\nBut I should think about future moves after this.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0** head at (8,1), body long. Their possible moves:  \n- DOWN to (8,0) \u2014 apple at (8,0)? Yes, apple at (8,0) from list.  \n- LEFT to (7,1) \u2014 apple at (7,1)? Yes.  \n- UP to (8,2) \u2014 no apple.  \n- RIGHT to (9,1) \u2014 no apple.  \n\nThey might go for apple at (8,0) or (7,1).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0): next turn I could go UP to (5,1) \u2014 occupied by my body? My body: (5,1) is in my body list (second segment). So next turn, if I go LEFT now to (5,0), then UP to (5,1) would be into my body unless that segment moves by then. But snake movement: my tail end is at (4,3), so next turn my whole body shifts forward head to (5,0), so (5,1) becomes (6,1)? Wait let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nCurrent body: head (6,0), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), \u2026 tail (4,3).  \nIf I move LEFT to (5,0): new head at (5,0), then old head (6,0) becomes new segment 2, old segment 2 (6,1) becomes segment 3, etc., tail (4,3) might move forward if no apple eaten. So (5,1) currently occupied by old segment 3 (5,1) will shift to (4,1) next turn? Let\u2019s check:  \nNo apple eaten this turn (moving to (5,0) no apple), so length stays same, tail disappears at (4,3), each segment moves forward one position along path.  \n\nSegment (5,1) currently is the third body part. After moving left:  \nNew body: head (5,0), then (6,0), then (6,1), then (5,1), \u2026 so (5,1) becomes the fourth segment, not second. So cell (5,1) will be occupied next turn by my body (old third segment). So next turn if I\u2019m at (5,0), moving UP to (5,1) would hit myself.  \n\nSimilarly, from (5,0) next turn safe moves: LEFT to (4,0) apple there, DOWN off board, RIGHT to (6,0) empty? No, (6,0) will be my second segment then. So only LEFT to (4,0) is safe next turn? That\u2019s an apple, good. But after eating apple, I grow, so tail stays, so (5,1) still occupied? Actually eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t disappear, so length increases by 1, so old tail (4,3) stays, so shifting means (5,1) still occupied next turn if I go UP from (5,0). So indeed from (5,0) next turn only LEFT to (4,0) is safe. That\u2019s fine but then after that maybe trapped.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,0): next turn from (7,0) possible moves:  \nUP to (7,1) \u2014 apple there but enemy might be there if enemy moves LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) this turn. If enemy goes for (7,1) apple this turn, then next turn (7,1) occupied by enemy head or body. But if enemy goes for (8,0) apple, then (7,1) free.  \nLEFT to (6,0) \u2014 will be my body segment (old head) next turn, so death.  \nRIGHT to (8,0) \u2014 apple there, but enemy might go DOWN to (8,0) this turn and be there next turn.  \nDOWN off board.  \n\nSo from (7,0) next turn only UP might be safe if enemy not there, or RIGHT if enemy not there.  \n\nGiven enemy choices: enemy likely to go for apple at (8,0) (DOWN) or (7,1) (LEFT). If I go RIGHT to (7,0), enemy going LEFT to (7,1) means next turn I can\u2019t go UP safely. If enemy goes DOWN to (8,0), then (7,1) free next turn.  \n\n**Better to keep options open:**  \nLEFT to (5,0) \u2192 only one safe move next turn (LEFT to apple (4,0)), then after eating that apple, maybe more options.  \nRIGHT to (7,0) \u2192 possibly two safe moves next turn (UP if enemy not at (7,1), RIGHT if enemy not at (8,0)).  \n\nBut since enemy could block one, maybe still better than one option.  \n\nAlso, long-term: I have 23 apples, enemy 22. Need 30 to win. I\u2019m slightly ahead. Avoiding risk is good.  \n\nLEFT to (5,0) seems slightly riskier because only one follow-up move. RIGHT to (7,0) could give two if enemy chooses the other apple.  \n\nBut let\u2019s check immediate collision:  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,1) and I move RIGHT to (7,0), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (8,0) and I move RIGHT to (7,0), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (8,2) or RIGHT to (9,1), fine.  \nSo no head-on possible this turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT seems better for options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,0), check if (7,1) occupied by enemy, if not, go UP for apple, else go RIGHT to (8,0) if not occupied. If both occupied, maybe only DOWN (death) or LEFT (into my body at (6,0)), so that\u2019s bad. But enemy can\u2019t occupy both (7,1) and (8,0) in one turn. So at least one should be free.  \n\nI\u2019ll go RIGHT this turn.  \n\n**Next turn rationale reminder:** From (7,0), prefer UP to (7,1) if safe (enemy not there), else RIGHT to (8,0) if safe, else only LEFT into death or DOWN death, so avoid that by checking first.  \n\nRIGHT",

Even if the enemy moves RIGHT and survives, I remain alive with a chance to continue.\n\nNext turn, if the enemy is dead, I win.

That\u2019s acceptable for now to avoid immediate death.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (for my future self):\n- Move UP now to (9,2).\n- Continue moving UP along the right column toward the top, then attempt to sweep left along the top row to reach apples at (8,9) and nearby, while avoiding tight engagements with Snake #1.\n- Stay alert for any unexpected enemy movements that might try to cut me off; if the right edge becomes unsafe, look for an opening to peel off left into more open space.\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (7,2):\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 3)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 occupied by my own body segment \u2192 **not safe**  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 2)  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 2)  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check each for immediate death:\n\n**UP (7,3):**\n- Within board? Yes (y=3, x=7 inside 0\u20139).\n- Occupied by my body? Scan my body: (7,3) not in my body list \u2192 safe from my own body.\n- Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body list: (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9).  \n  (7,3) not in that list \u2192 safe from enemy body collision.\n- Enemy head collision? Enemy head is at (9,1). Possible enemy moves: UP\u2192(9,2), DOWN\u2192(9,0), LEFT\u2192(8,1), RIGHT\u2192(off board). So enemy can\u2019t move to (7,3) in one move \u2192 no head-on collision possible.\n- So **UP** is safe.\n\n**LEFT (6,2):**\n- Within board? Yes.\n- My body? Not in my body list \u2192 safe.\n- Enemy body? Not in enemy body list \u2192 safe.\n- Enemy head could move to (6,2)? Enemy at (9,1) can\u2019t reach (6,2) in one move \u2192 safe.\n- So **LEFT** is safe.\n\n**RIGHT (8,2):**\n- Within board? Yes.\n- My body? Not in my body list \u2192 safe.\n- Enemy body? (8,2) is in enemy body list! Yes, enemy body contains (8,2) (the 5th element in enemy body list). So moving RIGHT into (8,2) would hit enemy body \u2192 **not safe**.\n\nSo safe moves: **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Which is better strategically?\n\nApples nearby:  \n(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (7,5), (3,8), etc.  \n\nFrom (7,2):\n- UP to (7,3) \u2192 closer to apples at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) in terms of Manhattan distance?  \n  (7,3) to (6,4) = |7-6|+|3-4| = 1+1=2  \n  (7,3) to (5,4) = 3  \n  (7,2) to (6,4) = 3  \n  So UP improves slightly toward those apples.\n\n- LEFT to (6,2) \u2192 closer to apple at (6,4)?  \n  (6,2) to (6,4) = 2  \n  (7,2) to (6,4) = 3  \n  So LEFT also improves toward (6,4), but (6,4) is closer from (6,2) than from (7,3)? Let\u2019s check:  \n  (7,3) to (6,4) = 2  \n  (6,2) to (6,4) = 2  \n  Same distance.\n\nCheck immediate next-turn safety:  \nFrom (7,3): possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nFrom (6,2): possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nBoth seem similarly open.\n\nBut enemy snake head is at (9,1), moving toward left side of board likely. If I go LEFT to (6,2), I\u2019m moving toward center-left where enemy body is coiled around. Could get blocked later.  \nUP to (7,3) keeps me more central with more escape routes toward apples at (4,7), (3,8), etc.\n\nAlso, my long body is mostly on left side (columns 1\u20134), so moving UP opens space to maneuver around right side maybe.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe have 25 apples, enemy has 23. Need 30 to win. 5 apples to go. Safe path toward multiple apples: (6,4) and (5,4) are reachable from (7,3) via UP then LEFT. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s body cluster near columns 8\u20139. Keep distance from enemy head\u2019s possible path. Try to collect apples in columns 4\u20136 while staying flexible.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Check each for immediate death:\n\n**UP (7, 4):**  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? Not in my body list \u2192 safe from my own body.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body list: [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)]  \n  (7, 4) not in that list \u2192 safe from enemy body.  \n- Enemy head collision possible? Enemy head at (9, 2) can move UP\u2192(9, 3), DOWN\u2192(9, 1), LEFT\u2192(8, 2), RIGHT\u2192(off board).  \n  None of those are (7, 4) \u2192 no head-on collision possible this turn.  \nSo **UP** is safe.  \n\n**LEFT (6, 3):**  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- My body? Not in my body list \u2192 safe.  \n- Enemy body? Not in enemy body list \u2192 safe.  \n- Enemy head could move to (6, 3)? Enemy head moves: (9, 2) \u2192 UP (9, 3), DOWN (9, 1), LEFT (8, 2), RIGHT (off board).  \n  (6, 3) not reachable in one move \u2192 safe.  \nSo **LEFT** is safe.  \n\n**RIGHT (8, 3):**  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- My body? Not in my body list \u2192 safe.  \n- Enemy body? (8, 3) is in enemy body list (6th element: (8, 3)) \u2192 moving RIGHT would hit enemy body \u2192 **not safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: **UP** and **LEFT**.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Strategic choice:\n\nFrom (7, 3):  \n- **UP** to (7, 4):  \n  - Closer to apples (7, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 7).  \n  - Manhattan distance to (7, 5) = 1, to (6, 4) = 2, to (5, 4) = 3.  \n  - From (7, 4), next moves could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would be into my body at (7, 3) next turn? Wait, next turn my body will shift forward, so (7, 3) will be my neck, so DOWN would be into my own neck \u2192 not safe next turn? Actually, after moving UP to (7, 4), my body becomes [(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), ...], so DOWN from (7, 4) goes to (7, 3) which will be occupied by my own body next turn \u2192 yes, DOWN will be unsafe next turn. So UP now reduces future options slightly.)  \n\n- **LEFT** to (6, 3):  \n  - Closer to apples (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 7), (3, 8).  \n  - Manhattan distance to (6, 4) = 1, to (5, 4) = 2, to (4, 4) = 3.  \n  - From (6, 3), next moves: UP\u2192(6, 4) has apple, DOWN\u2192(6, 2) safe, LEFT\u2192(5, 3) safe, RIGHT\u2192(7, 3) safe (will be empty next turn since I left it). So LEFT now gives more options next turn.  \n\nEnemy head at (9, 2) is far away, but enemy body occupies columns 8\u20139 and some of column 7 bottom.  \n\nBetter to go for nearest apple: (6, 4) is reachable from (6, 3) in one move UP next turn. From (7, 4), (6, 4) is also one move LEFT next turn, but that risks moving near enemy territory if enemy expands leftward.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nWe have 25 apples, need 30 to win. Enemy has 23 apples.  \nClosest apples: (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (7, 5), (3, 8), (4, 7).  \nFrom (6, 3), we can go UP to (6, 4) apple next turn, then continue toward (5, 4) or (4, 4).  \nSafer path: avoid moving toward enemy body at (8, 3)\u2013(8, 7) etc.  \nKeep distance from enemy head possible path (likely moving leftward toward col 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Possible moves from (6, 3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6, 4)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 2)  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 3)  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 3)  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Immediate safety check:\n\n**UP (6, 4):**  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- In my body? No.  \n- In enemy body? No.  \n- Possible enemy head collision? Enemy at (9, 3) can move UP\u2192(9, 4), DOWN\u2192(9, 2), LEFT\u2192(8, 3), RIGHT\u2192(off board). None are (6, 4).  \n- Safe.\n\n**DOWN (6, 2):**  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- In my body? No.  \n- In enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head reachable? No.  \n- Safe.\n\n**LEFT (5, 3):**  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- In my body? No.  \n- In enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head reachable? No.  \n- Safe.\n\n**RIGHT (7, 3):**  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- In my body? Yes \u2014 (7, 3) is the first element of my body (my neck). Moving RIGHT would hit my own body \u2192 **not safe**.\n\nSo safe moves: **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Strategic choice:\n\n**Apples nearby:**  \n(6, 4) \u2014 distance 1 from UP  \n(5, 4) \u2014 distance 2 from UP+LEFT or LEFT+UP  \n(4, 4) \u2014 distance 3  \n(7, 5) \u2014 distance 3 via RIGHT+UP but RIGHT not safe now  \n(3, 8) \u2014 far  \n(4, 7) \u2014 far  \n(0, 3) \u2014 far left  \n\nFrom (6, 3):  \n- **UP (6, 4)** eats apple immediately next turn if we stay there? Wait \u2014 (6, 4) is an apple now, so moving UP eats it this turn. Yes \u2014 apple at (6, 4) in apple list. So **UP** gets us an apple now.  \n- **LEFT (5, 3)** puts us closer to (5, 4) and (4, 4) but doesn\u2019t eat now.  \n- **DOWN (6, 2)** moves away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future safety after eating apple:\n\nIf we eat apple at (6, 4):  \nOur body grows by 1, so tail doesn\u2019t move. New head at (6, 4), body becomes:  \n[(6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), \u2026 , (3, 5)] \u2014 tail stays at (3, 5).  \n\nFrom (6, 4) next turn:  \nPossible moves: UP (6, 5), DOWN (6, 3), LEFT (5, 4), RIGHT (7, 4).  \nCheck each:  \n- UP (6, 5): not in my new body (since (6, 5) not in current body except maybe enemy body? Enemy body has (6, 5)? Yes, enemy body list: \u2026 (6, 5) is there. So UP into enemy body \u2192 not safe next turn.  \n- DOWN (6, 3): will be occupied by my body next turn (old head) \u2192 not safe.  \n- LEFT (5, 4): apple there, not in my body, not in enemy body? Enemy body: (5, 5), (4, 5), etc. \u2014 (5, 4) safe now.  \n- RIGHT (7, 4): safe? Not in my body, not in enemy body (enemy has (7, 7), (7, 6) but not (7, 4)).  \n\nSo after eating (6, 4), only LEFT and RIGHT might be safe next turn \u2014 tight but manageable.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy movement risk:\n\nEnemy head at (9, 3) could move LEFT to (8, 3) or DOWN to (9, 2) or UP to (9, 4).  \n(8, 3) is enemy body already, so maybe they won\u2019t go there. Their safest moves likely UP or DOWN. They are far from us, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Score situation:\n\nWe have 25 apples, need 30 to win. Enemy 23 apples. Eating (6, 4) \u2192 26 apples.  \nThen (5, 4) apple next if possible.  \n\nWe should prioritize eating apples safely. UP gets apple now, but restricts next turn options (only LEFT/RIGHT safe). LEFT gets no apple now but keeps more options open next turn.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Tiebreaker: future flexibility:\n\nFrom (5, 3) after LEFT:  \nNext moves: UP (5, 4) apple, DOWN (5, 2) safe, LEFT (4, 3) safe, RIGHT (6, 3) safe.  \nThat\u2019s 4 options, and we can eat (5, 4) next turn.  \n\nFrom (6, 4) after UP: only 2 safe options next turn (LEFT/RIGHT). Riskier if enemy moves toward us.\n\n---\n\nGiven we have a small lead (25 vs 23), we don\u2019t need to take big risks.  \nLEFT is safe now and gives more options next turn while still heading toward apple (5, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 3), go UP to (5, 4) to eat apple if safe, else maneuver to avoid enemy body near (5, 5)\u2013(6, 5)\u2013(4, 5). Keep away from enemy head likely moving leftward along row 3 or 4.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Staying on the right edge is somewhat restrictive but currently safest given other directions are blocked.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP now to (9,6), then again to (9,7) to collect the apple.\n- After taking top apples, sweep left along the top row to (8,9) and then descend into open space, avoiding being boxed by Snake #1. Monitor Snake #1\u2019s approach and be ready to peel left earlier if it tries to cut off the right edge.\n\nUP",

Eliminate moves that kill me immediately**\n\n- **UP (5, 5)**  \n  Check board: (5,5) is part of snake #0\u2019s body? Looking at enemy body:  \n  Snake #0 body list includes (5,5)? Yes \u2014 (5,5) is in Snake #0\u2019s body (enemy snake body). That would kill me.  \n  So UP is unsafe.\n\n- **DOWN (5, 3)**  \n  My own body? My body list: [(5,3), \u2026] \u2014 first body segment after head is (5,3). That\u2019s directly behind my head, moving back into my own body \u2192 death.  \n  So DOWN is unsafe.\n\n- **LEFT (4, 4)**  \n  Check board: (4,4) is an apple? Yes, apples list includes (4,4).  \n  Apple is safe unless occupied by enemy body.  \n  Snake #0 body list: (4,4) not in it.  \n  Not off board. Not my own body (check my body: no (4,4)).  \n  So LEFT is safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6, 4)**  \n  Check board: (6,4) is an apple? Yes, apples list includes (6,4).  \n  Snake #0 body list: (6,4) not in it.  \n  Not off board. Not my body (check my body: no (6,4)).  \n  So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions**\n\nEnemy Snake #0 head at (9,5).  \nPossible enemy moves: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5), RIGHT off board (10,5) \u2192 invalid.\n\nCheck my safe moves vs enemy moves:\n\n- If I go LEFT to (4,4), enemy heads can\u2019t reach (4,4) in 1 move (too far). No head-on risk.\n\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,4), enemy heads can\u2019t reach (6,4) in 1 move (too far). No head-on risk.\n\nSo both safe from head-on collisions.\n\n---\n\n**3. Which is better strategically?**\n\nApples: (4,4) and (6,4) are both apples. Eating either grows me by 1.\n\nBut check future safety after move:\n\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**  \n  New head at (4,4), body grows by 1, tail stays same length? Actually eating apple means length increases by 1, so tail doesn\u2019t move this turn. So new body will be: head at (4,4), then old head (5,4) becomes new second segment, then rest of body as is (except tail stays).  \n\n  After eating (4,4), my head is at (4,4). Next turn possible moves from (4,4): UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4).  \n  Check quickly:  \n  UP (4,5): currently occupied by Snake #0\u2019s body? Snake #0 body list: (4,5) is there? Yes, enemy snake body at (4,5). So UP next turn blocked unless enemy moves away (possible).  \n  DOWN (4,3): free? Board shows T at (4,3)? My body: (4,3) not listed, enemy body: not listed. Actually (4,3) is free now.  \n  LEFT (3,4): free? Seems free.  \n  RIGHT (5,4): occupied by my new second segment (old head) next turn, so not safe then.\n\n  So from (4,4) next turn, at least DOWN and LEFT are likely safe unless enemy moves into them.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**  \n  New head at (6,4), apple eaten, body grows. Next turn from (6,4): UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4).  \n  UP (6,5): enemy body? Snake #0 body list includes (6,5)? Yes, (6,5) is in enemy body. So blocked.  \n  DOWN (6,3): my body? (6,3) is my current body segment (yes, second segment currently). After growth, (6,3) will be third segment, still occupied next turn. So DOWN blocked.  \n  LEFT (5,4): will be my second segment next turn \u2192 blocked.  \n  RIGHT (7,4): free? Currently board shows (7,4) empty? No enemy body there. My body? No. So RIGHT only safe exit next turn.\n\nSo RIGHT \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s risky if enemy can block (7,4) or if (7,4) becomes unsafe later.\n\nLEFT \u2192 at least 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT), maybe more depending on enemy moves.\n\nThus LEFT is better for keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**4. Long-term plan note for next turn**  \nFrom (4,4), prioritize staying safe, maybe go DOWN to (4,3) or LEFT to (3,4) to avoid enemy body at (4,5). Keep collecting apples toward 30.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (9, 7) \u2014 apple there.  \n- DOWN (9, 5) \u2014 enemy\u2019s own body segment (second segment after head).  \n- LEFT (8, 6) \u2014 enemy\u2019s own body (see list: (8, 6) is in it).  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 impossible.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (9, 7). That\u2019s far from my possible moves (4, 3) and (3, 4). No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Consider apples and future safety**  \n\nApples nearby:  \n- (4, 3) has no apple.  \n- (3, 4) has no apple.  \n- Closest apples: (4, 7), (3, 8), (2, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), etc.  \n\nFrom (4, 3) next turn:  \nUP back to (4, 4) \u2014 will be empty after I leave it? Yes, but (5, 4) is my body next turn, so (4, 4) is safe unless enemy enters.  \nLEFT (3, 3) \u2014 free? Board shows T at (3, 3)? Actually my body has (3, 3)? No. Enemy body has (3, 3)? No. Seems free.  \nRIGHT (5, 3) \u2014 my body currently at (5, 3), after moving, it will shift, but (5, 3) will be my second body segment next turn if I go DOWN now? Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3), my new body: head (4, 3), then old head (4, 4) becomes second, then old (5, 4) third, then old (5, 3) fourth, etc. So (5, 3) is still occupied next turn. So RIGHT from (4, 3) next turn is blocked.  \nDOWN (4, 2) \u2014 free? My body has (4, 2) currently, but after move, (4, 2) will be free? Wait, my body: (4, 2) is in my current body list (12th segment). After moving, tail (3, 6) will move? No, because I didn\u2019t eat apple this turn \u2192 tail moves forward, so (3, 6) disappears, all others shift. So (4, 2) will be occupied by my body next turn (specifically, the segment after (4, 3) and (4, 4) etc \u2014 let\u2019s trace: new body: head (4, 3), then (4, 4), then (5, 4), then (5, 3), then (6, 3), then (7, 3), etc. So (4, 2) not in new body list. Actually (4, 2) is free next turn. Yes.  \n\nSo from (4, 3) next turn, safe moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN (maybe).  \n\nFrom (3, 4) next turn:  \nUP (3, 5) \u2014 free? Board shows T? Actually enemy body at (3, 5)? No. My body? No.  \nDOWN (3, 3) \u2014 free.  \nLEFT (2, 4) \u2014 free? Yes.  \nRIGHT (4, 4) \u2014 free (my old head position, now empty). So all 4 moves possibly safe.  \n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT give good future options, but LEFT (3, 4) gives slightly more freedom next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan**  \n\nI have 27 apples, enemy has 23. Need 30 to win.  \nClosest apple after (3, 4) is (2, 3) or (3, 0) or (4, 7) etc.  \nFrom (3, 4), can go DOWN next turn to (3, 3), then LEFT to (2, 3) for apple.  \nOr from (4, 3), can go LEFT to (3, 3) then DOWN to (2, 3) for apple.  \n\nLEFT now seems better for keeping central space open.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

Enemy at (9,8) cannot reach (2,3) in 1 move.  \nSo DOWN is safe and gets apple.  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT (1,4):**  \n- In bounds: yes.  \n- Own body? Yes! (1,4) is in my body list (it\u2019s part of my snake\u2019s body). So moving LEFT kills me immediately.  \nLEFT is **not safe**.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT (3,4):**  \n- In bounds: yes.  \n- Own body? (3,4) is the first segment of my body (right behind head). Moving RIGHT would go directly into my own neck \u2192 immediate death.  \nRIGHT is **not safe**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Remaining safe moves: UP and DOWN  \n\nBoth are safe immediately. DOWN gets an apple at (2,3).  \nEating apple is good: I\u2019m at 27 apples, enemy at 24. Getting to 28 puts me closer to 30 (win condition).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future safety after move  \n\n**DOWN to (2,3)** after eating apple: my body will grow by 1 segment, so my tail won\u2019t move next turn. My new head at (2,3). From there:  \n- Possible moves from (2,3): UP back to (2,4) (occupied by my old head\u2019s old position? Wait, after move, body becomes: head=(2,3), then old head (2,4) becomes new second segment, etc. Actually let\u2019s simulate: My body before move: head (2,4), body[0]=(3,4)... After moving DOWN to (2,3) and eating apple: new head (2,3), then segment1 = old head (2,4), segment2 = (3,4), ... tail stays same (no tail movement because growth). So (2,4) occupied.  \nSo from (2,3), moves: UP to (2,4) \u2192 occupied by my own body next turn \u2192 not safe next turn. LEFT (1,3) \u2192 check if free: currently (1,3) is in my body list? Yes, (1,3) is in my current body. After move, (1,3) might become free? Let\u2019s check: My current body includes (1,3) as part of the long chain. After moving head to (2,3) and growing, the tail (2,7) stays, so (1,3) remains occupied. So LEFT not safe next turn. RIGHT (3,3) \u2192 currently free? Not in my body currently, not in enemy body. So safe next turn. DOWN (2,2) \u2192 free? Not in my body currently, not in enemy body. So safe next turn.  \nSo from (2,3), next turn safe moves: RIGHT and DOWN. Two options.  \n\n**UP to (2,5)** no apple:  \nFrom (2,5): possible moves next turn: UP (2,6) \u2013 free? Currently not in my body, not enemy body. DOWN (2,4) \u2013 will be occupied by my own body next turn (old head position becomes second segment). LEFT (1,5) \u2013 currently (1,5) in my body list? Yes, (1,5) is in my current body, so after move it remains occupied (tail doesn\u2019t move). So LEFT not safe next turn. RIGHT (3,5) \u2013 free? Not in my body, not in enemy body.  \nSo from (2,5), safe next turn: UP and RIGHT. Two options.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Which is better?  \n\nDOWN gets apple and leaves me with 2 safe moves next turn. UP gives no apple but also 2 safe moves next turn. Since I want to win by reaching 30 apples first, taking apple now is good. Also, enemy is at 24 apples, I\u2019m at 27 \u2192 if I eat now I\u2019m at 28, closer to win.  \n\nCheck if enemy can kill me if I go DOWN: enemy head at (9,8). They might move toward apples near them: (8,9), (7,4), etc. They can\u2019t reach me in 1 move. No risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2,3), I\u2019ll have head at (2,3), body extended. Next turn from (2,3), consider moving RIGHT toward (3,3) which is open space, then maybe toward apple at (3,0) or (4,0) or (0,3) etc. Avoid trapping myself near enemy\u2019s long body along right edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Enemy has 24.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,2), I die next turn no matter what \u2192 can\u2019t do that.  \nSo only RIGHT (3,3) is viable.  \n\nFrom (3,3) next turn, only (4,3) safe. Then from (4,3) maybe can go DOWN to (4,2) (occupied? Let\u2019s check: (4,2) is in my body currently, but after two moves, tail may move if no apple eaten\u2026 Actually, I ate apple last turn, so tail stays until I move without eating. So (4,2) will remain occupied until I eat an apple and then move enough for tail to move). This is getting tight.  \n\nBut maybe better: from (4,3) next turn, check if (4,4) is free? No, (4,4) is in my body. So (4,3) \u2192 only (5,3) maybe free? Need to check: (5,3) in my body currently. Hmm, I\u2019m wrapping myself.  \n\nActually, looking at board: my snake is a long coil around left side. I need to navigate toward an apple without trapping myself.  \n\nClosest apples: (3,0) is below, but blocked by my body at (4,1),(3,1),(3,2) etc.  \n(0,3) is left but blocked by my body.  \n(3,5) is above but (3,4) is my body.  \n(4,7) is far.  \n\nSo safest: go RIGHT to (3,3), then RIGHT to (4,3), then maybe UP to (4,4) will be free next turn? No, (4,4) is my body now and will still be next turn unless tail moves (tail at (2,7) moves only after I move without eating apple).  \n\nThis is risky. Maybe I should consider if any move could kill enemy? No, too far.  \n\nActually, wait \u2014 recheck DOWN\u2019s future: I assumed (2,1) etc. are occupied next turn. But if I move to (2,2) without eating apple, my tail (2,7) will move forward to (2,6) because no growth. Then (2,1) might become free? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nCurrent body:  \nHead (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), \u2026 up to tail (2,7).  \n\nIf I move to (2,2) without eating:  \nNew head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), \u2026 up to (2,6) (tail moves from (2,7) to (2,6)).  \nSo (2,1) is free, (1,2) is free? Wait, (1,2) is in original body but after shift: original (1,2) becomes (1,1)? No, the whole body shifts: segment at (1,2) moves to (1,1) because tail moves? Actually, the body doesn\u2019t shift uniformly; only the tail cell moves forward along body path.  \n\nLet\u2019s list body after DOWN to (2,2) without eating:  \nNew body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), \u2026 up to (1,8), then (2,8), (2,7) gone, new tail at (2,6)? Wait, my body path from (2,4) to tail (2,7) is: (2,4)-(3,4)-\u2026-(1,8)-(2,8)-(2,7). So after moving head to (2,2), the segment at (2,7) is removed (tail), so new tail is (2,8)? No, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 the tail is the last segment, which is (2,7) now. After moving head to (2,2), the tail becomes the former second-to-last segment (2,8). So (2,7) disappears.  \n\nThen (2,1) is free, (1,2) is now at (1,2) still? Actually, (1,2) in old body is still in new body because we just removed (2,7) from the end. So (1,2) remains occupied.  \n\nThus from (2,2), next turn:  \nUP (2,3) occupied, DOWN (2,1) free, LEFT (1,2) occupied, RIGHT (3,2) occupied.  \n\nSo DOWN (2,2) gives one safe move next turn: DOWN to (2,1). That\u2019s better than zero I thought earlier.  \n\nSo both RIGHT (3,3) and DOWN (2,2) give one safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Choose based on apple access**  \nFrom (2,2), next turn only (2,1) safe, then from (2,1) maybe can go to (2,0) etc., toward apple at (3,0) or (4,0).  \n\nFrom (3,3), next turn only (4,3) safe, then maybe (5,3) etc., toward apple at (4,7) or (7,5) eventually.  \n\nI have 28 apples, need 2 more. The apple at (3,0) is closer to the (2,2) path.  \n\nLet\u2019s check if from (2,1) after next move, (3,1) is free? Currently (3,1) is in my body, but after two moves without eating, tail moves enough to free it? Possibly.  \n\nSafer to go DOWN now to (2,2), then DOWN to (2,1), then RIGHT to (3,1) if free, then DOWN to (3,0) for apple #29.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN to (2,2) \u2192 sets up path toward (3,0) apple.  \n\nRIGHT to (3,3) leads toward center but more blocked by my own body soon.  \n\nI\u2019ll go DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2,2), move DOWN to (2,1) next turn if possible, then aim for (3,0) apple, then (4,0) apple to reach 30. Avoid enemy\u2019s long body on right side.  \n\nDOWN",
