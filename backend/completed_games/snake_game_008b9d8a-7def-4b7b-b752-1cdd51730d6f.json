Then I'd be at the mercy of their movements. The apple at (5,9) is a shorter journey but potentially less rewarding than the lower apple. \n\nIf I choose the down path, I'll have a straight shot at the bottom right apple, allowing me to grow to a respectable length. However, the path is congested with several apple locations, and I'd need to carefully thread the snake to avoid hitting my own body or other obstacles in the dense lower area. The enemy's lack of current movement favors this option.\n\nOverall, both paths carry risks, but I'll prioritize securing the bottom right apple by going down.
