I'm continuing my path toward the apple at (4, 0), which is now just 2 moves away directly below me.\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2, 1) with body at [(1, 1), (0, 1)]. They seem to be moving around in the bottom-left area but are not threatening my current path.\n\nLet me check the distances to all apples from my current position (4, 2):\n- (9, 6): |9-4| + |6-2| = 5 + 4 = 9 moves\n- (6, 9): |6-4| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9 moves  \n- (4, 0): |4-4| + |0-2| = 0 + 2 = 2 moves\n- (7, 8): |7-4| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9 moves\n- (6, 6): |6-4| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\n\nThe apple at (4, 0) is still clearly the closest and most efficient target. I'm perfectly aligned vertically with it, so continuing straight down is optimal.\n\nLooking at the board, the path down to (4, 1) is completely clear. The enemy snake is at (2, 1) which is 2 squares to my left, so there's no collision risk.\n\nAfter I get this apple at (4, 0), I should reassess the board. The next closest apple would likely be at (6, 6) which would be about 4 moves away from (4, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving DOWN to reach (4, 1), then one more move down to collect the apple at (4, 0). After collecting it, I should consider targeting the apple at (6, 6) next, but will need to monitor the enemy snake's movements.\n\nDOWN"
