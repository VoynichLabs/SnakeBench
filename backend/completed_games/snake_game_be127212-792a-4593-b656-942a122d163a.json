Collecting the apple at (4,1) from down also sets you up to later maneuver to (3,0) or even reposition to reach (5,2) if needed. Meanwhile, moving RIGHT to (5,2) is also safe and would get the apple there, but it may leave you a step further away from the bottom cluster. Since the idea is to quickly capitalize on the cluster of centers apples in this area, going DOWN appears to be the more natural follow-up move.\n\nThere\u2019s no risk from walls or the enemy snake (which is far off at (1,8)), so I\u2019ll choose the move that reinforces your cluster control.\n\nStrategy for the near future:\n\u2022 Grab the apple at (4,1) by moving DOWN.\n\u2022 Then, evaluate whether to pivot left toward (3,0) or back toward the other apple at (5,2), keeping in mind your longer snake body as you grow.\n\nWith that in mind, my next move is: DOWN."
