It's at (8,6).  The apple at (9,8) is still a distant goal. Staying right seems like it might still be good, but lets examine a direct path to the most immediate apple. The (6,4) apple is close by heading down and left. The (5,3) is more easily obtained down & left as well. Let examine heading left first.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll be at (4, 7). Then I can move DOWN to (4, 6) and then LEFT to (3,6) which gives me a clear path to the (6,4) apple via movement rightwards. This is a long path, but is clearer than going right when thinking past next move.\n\nRIGHT",
