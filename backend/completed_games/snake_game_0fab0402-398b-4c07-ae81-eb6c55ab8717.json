Our body occupies the cells going left: (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7).  \n\u2022 The enemy snake\u2019s head is at (3,8) and its body spans (4,8) to (8,8), so moving UP to any y=8 cell is unsafe.  \n\u2022 Moving LEFT would send us into our own body at (4,7), so that\u2019s not an option.  \n\nThat leaves us with DOWN (to (5,6)) or RIGHT (to (6,7)).  \n\u2022 Moving RIGHT lands us at (6,7) and gives us a Manhattan distance to the (7,3) apple of |7\u20136| + |3\u20137| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.  \n\u2022 Moving DOWN sends us to (5,6) and the same apple becomes |7\u20135| + |3\u20136| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps away.  \n\nLooking at the other apples, note that the ones on the left (at (2,2) and (1,1)) would be slightly closer if we head down and then steer left, since from (5,6) the distance to (2,2) is |2\u20135| + |2\u20136| = 3 + 4 = 7, while from (6,7) to (2,2) it is 4 + 5 = 9.  \n\nThus, moving DOWN keeps us safe and nudges us toward a potential route toward the cluster of apples in the bottom left. Additionally, we avoid the enemy snake\u2019s territory on row 8.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

Let\u2019s analyze them:\n\n\u2022 Moving DOWN to (5,5) reduces our vertical position. From (5,5) the apple at (7,3) is |7\u20135| + |3\u20135| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps away, while the cluster of left-side apples (at (2,2) and (1,1)) is |5\u20132| + |5\u20132| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps from there.  \n\u2022 Moving RIGHT to (6,6) brings us toward (7,3) as well, where the distance would be |7\u20136| + |3\u20136| = 1 + 3 = 4. However, if we go right, we might later have fewer options when trying to pivot toward the bottom left apple cluster.  \n\u2022 Moving LEFT to (4,6) would bring us closer towards the left-hand apples (distance to (2,2) would be |4\u20132| + |6\u20132| = 2 + 4 = 6), but that move makes the (7,3) apple less accessible, as it increases the steps to that target.\n\nGiven our earlier rationale that a DOWN move keeps us safe and positions us advantageously for either apple cluster\u2014and noticing that from (5,5) we\u2019re only 4 steps away from the tasty (7,3) apple\u2014continuing with our previous tactic seems wise.\n\nAs our snake\u2019s head progresses along the DOWN direction for now, we can later decide to orient our movement toward (7,3) by stepping RIGHT, or begin a course for the left-side cluster if needed. For this turn, the safest and most versatile move is to continue DOWN.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
