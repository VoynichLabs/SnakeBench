Possible moves: UP (7, 3), DOWN (7, 1), LEFT (6, 2), RIGHT (8, 2).  \nNone of these intersect my possible next head positions (1, 8), (1, 6), (0, 7), (2, 7) \u2014 so no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future options**  \n\nClosest apple to me: (4, 7) is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance (dx=3, dy=0).  \n(2, 6) is 2 steps away (dx=1, dy=1).  \n\nFrom my head (1, 7):  \n- UP (1, 8): moves away from (2, 6) and (4, 7).  \n- DOWN (1, 6): moves closer to (2, 6) (now 1 step away).  \n- LEFT (0, 7): moves away from both apples.  \n- RIGHT (2, 7): moves closer to (4, 7) (now 2 steps away) but away from (2, 6).  \n\n(2, 6) is the closest apple. DOWN gets me to (1, 6), then next turn I could go RIGHT to (2, 6) to eat it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Future safety after each move**  \n\nCheck each move\u2019s resulting position for next-turn safe moves:  \n\n1. **UP to (1, 8)**: Neighbors: (1, 9) top edge safe unless enemy goes there (unlikely), (0, 8), (2, 8), (1, 7) (my current head, will be empty). Likely 3 safe moves next turn unless enemy moves into one.  \n2. **DOWN to (1, 6)**: Neighbors: (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 6) apple, (1, 7) empty. All 4 could be safe next turn unless enemy blocks.  \n3. **LEFT to (0, 7)**: Neighbors: (0, 8), (1, 7) empty, (0, 6) \u2014 only 3 neighbors total (left is off board). So 2 or 3 safe moves next turn.  \n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7)**: Neighbors: (2, 8), (3, 7), (2, 6) apple, (1, 7) empty \u2014 all 4 safe unless enemy blocks.  \n\nDOWN and RIGHT both keep 4 options open next turn and move toward an apple. DOWN moves toward the closest apple (2, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note**  \n\nPlan: Eat (2, 6) next turn, then consider (4, 7) or (6, 6). Keep distance from enemy snake (currently far away). Avoid boxing myself into top-left corner early.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN gets me closest to an apple while keeping options open.  \n\nDOWN",

New head at (4, 7), body becomes [(3, 7), (2, 7)].  \nThen next turn possible moves from (4, 7):  \n- UP (4, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (4, 6) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 7) \u2013 my own body (segment 1), fatal.  \n- RIGHT (5, 7) \u2013 empty.  \nSo after eating apple, I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nFrom (3, 8): possible next moves UP (3, 9), DOWN (3, 7) \u2013 safe (body at (2, 7)), LEFT (2, 8), RIGHT (4, 8) \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\nFrom (3, 6): possible next moves UP (3, 7) \u2013 safe, DOWN (3, 5) \u2013 safe, LEFT (2, 6), RIGHT (4, 6) \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision with enemy**  \nEnemy at (6, 5) is 2 steps away from (4, 7) (dx=2, dy=-2).  \nEnemy could move UP to (6, 6) (apple), DOWN to (6, 4), LEFT to (5, 5), RIGHT to (7, 5).  \nNone of these are (4, 7). So enemy cannot reach (4, 7) this turn.  \nBut if enemy moves UP to (6, 6), they eat apple there and grow, then next turn they could move toward me. Still safe this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT gets me an apple immediately, growing to length 3, increasing my score and making me safer from head-on collisions.  \nFuture safety after RIGHT is fine (3 safe moves next turn).  \nUP and DOWN are safe but don\u2019t get apple now.  \n\nBest choice: RIGHT to eat apple at (4, 7).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (4, 7), avoid moving LEFT into own body. Consider moving UP toward (5, 9) or RIGHT to open space, depending on enemy position. Keep an eye on enemy snake #0\u2019s growth and movement toward apples.  \n\nRIGHT",

That gives me a good chance to get there first if I commit.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6), I\u2019m moving away from immediate conflict but also away from nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move**  \nIf UP to (7, 7): body next turn [(7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6)]  \nFrom (7, 7):  \n- UP to (7, 8) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN to (7, 6) \u2013 body (unsafe)  \n- LEFT to (6, 7) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT to (8, 7) \u2013 empty  \n\n3 safe moves next turn.\n\nIf DOWN to (7, 5): body next turn [(7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6)]  \nFrom (7, 5):  \n- UP to (7, 6) \u2013 body (unsafe)  \n- DOWN to (7, 4) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT to (6, 5) \u2013 body (unsafe)  \n- RIGHT to (8, 5) \u2013 empty  \n\nOnly 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 worse mobility.\n\nIf RIGHT to (8, 6): body next turn [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]  \nFrom (8, 6):  \n- UP to (8, 7) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN to (8, 5) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT to (7, 6) \u2013 body (unsafe)  \n- RIGHT to (9, 6) \u2013 empty  \n\n3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan**  \nI should aim for (7, 9) since it's closest and enemy is farther from it than from (5, 9).  \nGoing UP now positions me best for that apple while keeping options open.  \nAvoid DOWN because it reduces mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Enemy body at (7, 6) and (6, 6) \u2013 none of my moves hit those.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (5, 9), (7, 9), (4, 0), (0, 5), (0, 7).  \nClosest to me: (5, 9) is 1 step away directly above.  \nUP eats it immediately.  \nOther apples are far: (7, 9) is 2 steps away (dx=2, dy=1), (0, 7) is 5 steps away.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf I eat apple (5, 9):  \nNew body length 4: head (5, 9), then (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7). Tail stays at (4, 7) until I move off apple.  \nFrom (5, 9): safe moves?  \n- UP off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN (5, 8) \u2013 my body segment (since I just ate apple, (5, 8) is now second segment) \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT (4, 9) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 9) \u2013 empty.  \nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn if I eat apple now. That\u2019s risky but manageable if enemy is far.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 7):  \nNew body: [(5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8)], tail (4, 7) disappears.  \nFrom (5, 7): safe moves: UP (5, 8) is body, so DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7) \u2013 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 8):  \nNew body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)], tail (4, 7) disappears.  \nFrom (6, 8): safe moves: UP (6, 9), DOWN (6, 7), RIGHT (7, 8) \u2013 3 safe moves (LEFT (5, 8) is body).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision with enemy**  \nEnemy at (7, 7) could move UP (7, 8) or RIGHT (8, 7) toward top-right.  \nIf I go UP to (5, 9), enemy could go UP to (7, 8) \u2013 not same cell, no collision.  \nIf enemy goes UP twice next turn, could reach (7, 9) but not my (5, 9).  \nNo direct collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nEating apple now gets me to 3 apples, possibly leading enemy (currently 2 apples).  \nBut eating apple reduces my next-turn safe moves to 2 (LEFT/RIGHT along top edge).  \nEnemy is at (7, 7) \u2013 if it moves UP to (7, 8), then next turn it could move LEFT to (6, 8) or (5, 8) etc., possibly boxing me on top row.  \nSafer play might be to avoid apple now, keep flexibility, and eat it later? But enemy could eat (7, 9) or move toward (5, 9) in two turns.  \n\nActually, if I don\u2019t eat (5, 9) now, enemy could move UP twice to (7, 9) then LEFT to (6, 9) and be adjacent to (5, 9) by turn 9.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 8) now, next turn I could go UP to (6, 9) and be adjacent to (5, 9) and (7, 9). That might give me both apple options while keeping more safe moves.  \n\nBut going UP now eats apple immediately, gains point, and I can plan escape from top row next turn (LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9)).  \nGiven enemy is 2 cells away horizontally, I can afford to take apple and then move away from enemy next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I eat apple now, next turn move LEFT to (4, 9) (away from enemy at (7, 8) likely) and then consider going DOWN later. Avoid getting trapped on top row more than one turn.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP eats apple, gains point, minimal immediate risk.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s two safe moves, better flexibility.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement and apple risk**  \nEnemy at (7, 8) might move UP to (7, 9) to eat apple there. If I go RIGHT to (6, 9), I\u2019ll be adjacent to (7, 9). If enemy moves UP to (7, 9) this turn, we won\u2019t collide (different cells). Next turn, if enemy is at (7, 9) and I\u2019m at (6, 9), possible head-on collision if I go RIGHT to (7, 9) while enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9) simultaneously. That\u2019s risky but avoidable by choosing DOWN next turn.  \n\nIf enemy doesn\u2019t go UP, maybe it goes LEFT to (6, 8) \u2013 then from (6, 9) I could go DOWN to (6, 8) and collide head-on if enemy stays? Wait, if enemy moves LEFT to (6, 8) this turn, then enemy head at (6, 8) and my head at (6, 9) are adjacent vertically. Next turn if I go DOWN to (6, 8) and enemy stays still (unlikely) or moves elsewhere, collision possible only if we choose same cell.  \n\nBetter to avoid being adjacent to enemy head next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoing LEFT traps me badly (only one safe move next turn). Going RIGHT gives two safe moves and positions me to possibly get apple (7, 9) later if enemy doesn\u2019t take it now.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (7, 8), it\u2019s likely to go UP to (7, 9) to eat that apple this turn. If so, apple (7, 9) will be gone next turn, but I\u2019ll be at (6, 9) with DOWN safe toward center.  \n\nI should prioritize keeping future options open. RIGHT is better than LEFT for next-turn flexibility.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT to (6, 9) \u2013 safe, keeps two moves next turn, avoids immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 9), if enemy ate (7, 9), enemy head at (7, 9), avoid RIGHT to prevent head-on. Choose DOWN to (6, 8) to move away. If enemy didn\u2019t eat (7, 9), consider RIGHT to eat it if safe.  \n\nRIGHT",

So (7, 9) will be empty unless enemy moves back into it next turn? Wait: enemy moving into (7, 9) from (7, 9) is impossible because it must move. So (7, 9) is empty for me to move into unless enemy moves LEFT into (6, 9) while I move RIGHT into (7, 9) \u2192 head-on collision. That\u2019s a risk.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9) and I move RIGHT to (7, 9), we swap positions without collision.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8) and I move RIGHT to (7, 9), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 9) and I move RIGHT to (7, 9), no collision.  \nOnly if enemy moves UP (off board) impossible. So no head-on unless enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9) while I move RIGHT to (7, 9)? That\u2019s not head-on \u2014 head-on is same cell. We\u2019d be in adjacent cells. So moving RIGHT to (7, 9) is safe from immediate head-on.  \n\nBut next turn: if enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9) and I move RIGHT to (7, 9), then enemy is at (6, 9) and I\u2019m at (7, 9). That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (4, 0), (0, 5), (0, 7), (2, 2), (6, 4).  \nClosest apple to (6, 9) is (6, 4) distance 5 vertically, others farther.  \nRIGHT to (7, 9) gets apple (7, 9) \u2014 wait, apple at (7, 9) is not listed in current apples? Board shows at row 9 col 7: \u201c0\u201d (enemy head), not \u201cA\u201d. So apple (7, 9) was eaten last turn by enemy. So no apple at (7, 9) now.  \n\nSo moving RIGHT gains no apple. Moving DOWN to (6, 8) moves toward center and closer to apple (6, 4) in long term.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 9):  \nNew body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)] (tail (4, 8) disappears).  \nFrom (7, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN (7, 8) \u2013 enemy body segment? Enemy body: after enemy moves, its body will be [(new head), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7)] if it grew from apple? Wait, enemy didn\u2019t eat apple this turn (no apple at (7, 9)), so enemy length stays 4. So (7, 8) will be enemy\u2019s second segment next turn \u2192 fatal for me to move into.  \n- LEFT (6, 9) \u2013 my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT (8, 9) \u2013 empty.  \nSo only RIGHT is safe next turn \u2192 very risky (one safe move).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 8):  \nNew body: [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)] (tail (4, 8) disappears).  \nFrom (6, 8) next turn:  \n- UP (6, 9) \u2013 my body segment \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN (6, 7) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (5, 8) \u2013 my body segment \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT (7, 8) \u2013 enemy body segment next turn? Enemy\u2019s body after moving: if enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9), its body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7)], so (7, 8) is enemy\u2019s third segment \u2192 fatal. If enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8), its body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 8)? Wait, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 need to simulate: current enemy: head (7, 9), body [(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]. If enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8), new head (7, 8), new body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7)] \u2014 (7, 8) appears twice? That means (7, 8) is both head and third segment \u2014 impossible because tail (7, 6) disappears. Actually, after moving without eating, tail disappears: new body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 8)]? Let\u2019s list: old: (7,9) head, (7,8) seg2, (7,7) seg3, (7,6) tail. Move DOWN: head to (7,8), seg2 becomes old head (7,9), seg3 becomes old seg2 (7,8), tail (7,6) disappears. So body: [(7,8), (7,9), (7,8)] \u2014 yes, (7,8) appears as head and seg3, so (7,8) is occupied by enemy head and body? That means (7,8) is doubly occupied? That\u2019s not possible in standard Snake \u2014 but in this game, body segments can\u2019t overlap. Actually, in Snake, when moving without eating, the tail moves forward, so segments shift: new head at (7,8), then old head (7,9) becomes segment2, old segment2 (7,8) becomes segment3, old segment3 (7,7) becomes tail, old tail (7,6) disappears. So segment3 is at (7,8) \u2014 same as head? That\u2019s a self-collision at start of turn? That can\u2019t happen because snake would die. So enemy moving DOWN to (7,8) is invalid because it would hit its own body at (7,8) (old segment2). So enemy cannot move DOWN.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves from (7,9): LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9). UP off board invalid, DOWN into own body invalid.  \n\nThus, if enemy moves LEFT to (6,9), its body: [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)] \u2192 (7,8) is enemy\u2019s third segment.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), its body: [(8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)] \u2192 (7,8) is enemy\u2019s third segment.  \n\nSo in either case, (7,8) is enemy body segment next turn.  \n\nTherefore, from my (6,8) next turn, RIGHT to (7,8) is fatal (enemy body).  \n\nSo from (6,8) next turn, safe moves: DOWN to (6,7) only? UP and LEFT fatal, RIGHT fatal. So only DOWN safe. That\u2019s also one safe move \u2014 risky.  \n\nBut wait, check DOWN from (6,8): (6,7) empty. So only one safe move next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare risks**  \nRIGHT now \u2192 only RIGHT safe next turn.  \nDOWN now \u2192 only DOWN safe next turn.  \n\nBoth give one safe move next turn, but DOWN moves toward center and apple (6,4), RIGHT moves to edge.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Try to avoid one-safe-move situation**  \nIs there a way to have more safe moves next turn? From (6,9), only DOWN and RIGHT were safe. DOWN leads to (6,8) with one safe move next turn. RIGHT leads to (7,9) with one safe move next turn.  \n\nMaybe I missed: from (6,8) next turn, if enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), then (7,8) is enemy body, but (6,7) is safe, (5,8) is my body, (6,9) my body, (7,8) enemy body. So only DOWN safe. Yes.  \n\nSo both options equal in next-turn flexibility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term and apple access**  \nApple at (6,4) is closest. Moving DOWN progresses toward it. Moving RIGHT goes away from it. So DOWN is better for apple access.  \n\nAlso, enemy at (7,9) might move LEFT to (6,9) \u2014 if I go DOWN to (6,8), we are adjacent vertically. Next turn if I go DOWN to (6,7) and enemy goes DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8), we might collide head-on? But enemy from (6,9) can\u2019t go DOWN to (6,8) if that\u2019s its own body? Let\u2019s check: enemy body after moving LEFT to (6,9): [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]. So (6,8) is empty for enemy. So enemy could go DOWN to (6,8) next turn. If I go DOWN to (6,7) same turn, no collision. Only if I go UP from (6,8) to (6,9) and enemy goes DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8) would we swap, not collide. So safe.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gives progress toward nearest apple and equal future flexibility as RIGHT. RIGHT goes to board edge with fewer future options after next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,8), only DOWN will be safe. Take it, then reassess.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, snakes move simultaneously, so if enemy chooses LEFT into its own body, it dies, but its body remains. So (7, 9) will be enemy body segment next turn regardless.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 9) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN to (8, 8) and RIGHT to (9, 9).  \n\nNow check my safe moves against enemy\u2019s possible next heads:  \n- My DOWN to (6, 7): not in {(8, 8), (9, 9)} \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n- My RIGHT to (7, 8): not in {(8, 8), (9, 9)} \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nAlso, (7, 8) is currently empty, but after enemy moves, if enemy goes DOWN to (8, 8), its body becomes [(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)]? Wait, careful: enemy current: head (8,9), body [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7)]. If enemy moves DOWN to (8,8), new head (8,8), body: [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8)] (tail (7,7) disappears). So (7, 8) becomes enemy\u2019s fourth segment. That means if I move RIGHT to (7, 8) this turn, I\u2019d be moving into a cell that will become enemy body after movement? No \u2014 movement is simultaneous. At the start of this turn, (7, 8) is empty. Enemy is not there now. After we move, if I go to (7, 8) and enemy goes to (8, 8), then at the end of the turn, (7, 8) is my head, not enemy\u2019s body. Enemy\u2019s body will include (7, 8) only if it doesn\u2019t move? But enemy moved, so its old body shifts: old head (8,9) becomes segment2, old segment2 (7,9) becomes segment3, old segment3 (7,8) becomes segment4 (tail), old tail (7,7) disappears. So (7, 8) is enemy\u2019s tail segment after this turn. That means if I go to (7, 8), I occupy the same cell as enemy\u2019s tail after movement \u2014 but tails are vacated before new head moves in standard Snake? Actually, in simultaneous movement: first all heads move, then if heads land on apples, growth happens, then tails are removed. So if enemy moves from (8,9) to (8,8), its old tail (7,7) is removed, and its old segment3 (7,8) becomes the new tail. But my head moving into (7,8) would collide with that tail segment at the end of the turn? The rule says: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d This check happens after heads move but before tails are removed? Usually, collision is checked against the positions before movement (except the tail tip that will move away). But here, (7,8) is currently empty, but after enemy moves, (7,8) will be part of enemy\u2019s body (the segment that was at (7,8) stays there because it shifts from segment3 to tail). That means at the moment heads move, (7,8) is empty, so no collision. After movement, (7,8) is my head and also enemy\u2019s tail \u2014 but two snakes can occupy same cell if one is tail? The rules don\u2019t forbid overlapping tails, only heads colliding with bodies. Since my head moved into an empty cell that later becomes enemy\u2019s tail, that\u2019s fine. So RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (4,0), (0,5), (0,7), (2,2), (6,4).  \nFrom (6,8):  \n- DOWN to (6,7) gets closer to (6,4) (distance 3 \u2192 2 in y).  \n- RIGHT to (7,8) moves slightly away from (6,4).  \nOther apples are far. So DOWN better for apple access.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,7):  \nNew body: [(6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9)] (tail (5,8) disappears).  \nFrom (6,7) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,8) my body \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) currently enemy body segment (enemy\u2019s tail now at (7,7)? Wait, after this turn enemy\u2019s tail will be at (7,8) if enemy moved DOWN, or at (7,7) if enemy moved RIGHT? Let\u2019s simulate both cases:  \n\nCase 1: Enemy moves DOWN to (8,8): enemy body: [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8)] \u2192 (7,7) empty.  \nCase 2: Enemy moves RIGHT to (9,9): enemy body: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8)] \u2192 (7,7) empty.  \nSo (7,7) will be empty next turn. So RIGHT from (6,7) to (7,7) safe.  \n\nThus from (6,7) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 three options. Good.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,8):  \nNew body: [(7,8), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9)] (tail (5,8) disappears).  \nFrom (7,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,9) enemy body segment (enemy\u2019s segment3) \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7) empty (as above).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8) my body \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) possibly enemy head? If enemy moved DOWN to (8,8), then (8,8) is enemy head \u2192 head-on collision if I go RIGHT. If enemy moved RIGHT to (9,9), then (8,8) empty. So RIGHT is risky \u2014 could be fatal if enemy chose DOWN.  \nSo from (7,8) next turn, only DOWN is certainly safe. LEFT and UP fatal, RIGHT possibly fatal. That\u2019s risky.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gives more future safe moves (3 options next turn) and moves toward nearest apple.  \nRIGHT gives fewer future safe moves and risks head-on if enemy goes DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,7), I\u2019ll have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe. Prefer moving toward apple (6,4) via DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid trapping. Keep options open.\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

We\u2019re not intersecting yet.  \nI have 6 apples vs enemy\u2019s 3, so I can play safe but should keep collecting.  \nLEFT is best for apple pursuit and safety.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter LEFT to (4, 3), next turn consider moving toward (3, 3) or (4, 2) to close in on (2, 2). Watch enemy movement\u2014they may go for top-left apples, so we might converge near (2, 2) later. Avoid head-on collisions.\n\nLEFT",

Good flexibility.\n\nIf DOWN to (3, 2):  \nNew body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)] (tail (5, 1) removed).  \nFrom (3, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 3) my body, fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) apple (2, 2) \u2013 eating it grows, so tail stays (5, 1) for next turn? Wait, careful: If I move onto apple, I grow, so body length becomes 8, tail remains (5, 1) for next turn\u2019s movement. That means from (3, 2) after eating apple, my body will be [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1)]. Then next turn, moving from (3, 2) after eating:  \n  - UP \u2192 (3, 3) my body, fatal.  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) empty.  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) my body (since apple eaten, new segment added at tail, but (2, 2) is now my body? No: apple at (2, 2) eaten this turn, so next turn (2, 2) is my neck, so moving LEFT into (2, 2) would be fatal. So only DOWN and RIGHT would be safe? Let\u2019s check:  \n    Actually, after eating apple at (2, 2) this turn, my body: head (3, 2), then (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1). So (2, 2) is free. Wait, I ate apple at (2, 2) by moving LEFT from (3, 2)? No, DOWN from (3, 3) to (3, 2) does not eat apple. Apple at (2, 2) is not reached this turn. So DOWN to (3, 2) does not eat apple. So next turn from (3, 2), apple at (2, 2) is still there. Then possible moves:  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (2, 2) apple (eat and grow).  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) empty.  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2) empty.  \n    UP is fatal (into (3, 3)). So three safe moves: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. Good flexibility.\n\nIf LEFT to (2, 3):  \nNew body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)] (tail (5, 1) removed).  \nFrom (2, 3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2) apple (2, 2) \u2013 eating it grows.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 3) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) my body, fatal.  \nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good flexibility.\n\nAll three safe moves keep good future options.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nClosest apple is (2, 2). From (3, 3):  \n- DOWN to (3, 2) \u2192 distance to (2, 2) = 1.  \n- LEFT to (2, 3) \u2192 distance to (2, 2) = 1.  \n- UP to (3, 4) \u2192 distance to (2, 2) = 3.  \n\nDOWN and LEFT both move toward (2, 2) equally.  \nEnemy at (1, 6) could go DOWN to (1, 5) or LEFT to (0, 6). From (1, 5), enemy could go DOWN to (1, 4) or LEFT to (0, 5) (apple).  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 3), I\u2019m closer to apple (2, 2) but also closer to enemy\u2019s possible path toward (0, 5).  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 2), I\u2019m below apple (2, 2) and farther from enemy\u2019s likely vertical movement.  \n\nBetter to approach apple from below to avoid head-on risk with enemy coming down.  \nDOWN to (3, 2) also opens possibility to go LEFT to apple next turn, while keeping option to go RIGHT or DOWN if enemy approaches.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter DOWN to (3, 2), next turn consider LEFT to (2, 2) to eat apple if enemy not threatening. If enemy moves toward (1, 5) or (0, 5), they\u2019re still 3+ cells away from (2, 2) next turn, so safe. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s length (4 apples) vs mine (6 apples) \u2014 I can afford to be slightly aggressive for apple.\n\nDOWN",

Keep distance from enemy\u2019s possible path up the right side. Avoid getting pinned in top-right corner later.  \n\nRIGHT",

Next turn from (5, 0): UP (5, 1) \u2013 apple, DOWN off board, LEFT (4, 0) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (6, 0) \u2013 empty. Only UP and LEFT/RIGHT safe? Wait: DOWN unsafe, so UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe.

Eating sooner reduces enemy\u2019s lead.  \nUP delays eating but positions for (5, 1) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.  \nEnemy is far away at (5, 6), so immediate eating is safe.  \n\nAlso, after eating (5, 0), I can go UP to (5, 1) next turn for another apple \u2014 two apples in two turns possible. That\u2019s a big advantage.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note**  \nAfter eating (5, 0), go UP to (5, 1) if safe, then maybe (5, 2) for 3 apples quickly. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s territory top-right until necessary. Stay in bottom-left quadrant to collect apples while enemy is long and possibly trapped in its own body.  \n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT or UP gets me closer to that cluster.  \nRIGHT moves me into more open space on the right side, away from my long body on the left. UP also works but keeps me closer to my body loop.  \nRIGHT seems slightly better because it opens more future paths toward (8,8) and (9,9) while staying clear of enemy\u2019s likely path upward along column 5.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (7,6), next turn consider UP toward (8,8) or DOWN toward bottom apples if safe. Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s movement near (5,1) and (5,2). Avoid getting pinned in top-right corner later.  \n\nRIGHT",

Not really \u2014 apples are at (5, 1), (1, 5), (9, 9), (5, 2), (8, 8).

All 4 moves safe \u2014 very open.  \n- LEFT (4, 1): next turn UP (4, 2) \u2013 empty, DOWN (4, 0) \u2013 empty, LEFT (3, 1) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (5, 1) \u2013 empty. All 4 safe.  \n- RIGHT (6, 1): next turn UP (6, 2) \u2013 empty, DOWN (6, 0) \u2013 my body (tail end?), check: (6, 0) is in my body \u2014 unsafe. So DOWN unsafe. LEFT (5, 1) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (7, 1) \u2013 empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nUP and LEFT give more options next turn than RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nEnemy has 13 apples, I have 11. Need to catch up.  \nUP gets an apple immediately and gives maximum flexibility next turn \u2014 can go UP again toward (8, 8) or (9, 9) later.  \nLEFT gets no apple but keeps me safe \u2014 less optimal for catching up.  \nRIGHT is slightly less safe next turn (only 3 moves).\n\nBest choice: UP for immediate apple and future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note**  \nAfter eating (5, 2), consider moving toward (8, 8) apple via (6, 2) \u2192 (7, 2) etc., or toward (0, 9) if safe. Avoid enemy\u2019s path near top-right. Keep expanding options.\n\nUP",

(8, 5) is enemy body currently, but enemy moves this turn. Wait: enemy\u2019s current body has (8, 5), but enemy head is at (4, 2) and will move away. After enemy moves, (8, 5) might become empty if enemy moves forward? Actually enemy\u2019s tail is at (9, 5), so (8, 5) is part of enemy body now. After enemy moves, its tail moves only if it doesn\u2019t eat apple. Enemy has 12 apples, no apple near it this turn, so it will move and its tail will shift: (9, 5) will become tail, (8, 5) might become empty. But it\u2019s risky to assume. Safer to check next turn.

Enemy is far away in bottom-left, but its long body along right edge (columns 8-9 rows 0-5) may shift. Avoid moving into its body path. From (8, 8) next turn, UP to (8, 9) then RIGHT to (9, 9) apple is possible if safe. Monitor enemy\u2019s head movement toward (4, 4) apple. Keep distance.  \n\nUP",

Actually, if I eat apple at (9, 9), my tail is at (1, 8), so my body occupies many cells. From (9, 9) only LEFT is safe. That\u2019s dangerous\u2014enemy could move toward me, and I\u2019d have no escape.  \n\nMaybe better to avoid apple now to keep flexibility? But avoiding apple means I stay at 14 apples, enemy could eat (4, 4) apple (actually apple at (4,4) not listed\u2014wait, apples listed: (1,5),(9,9),(0,9),(0,7),(5,8). No (4,4) apple now. Enemy might eat (5,8) apple? That\u2019s close to enemy head (4,4)? Distance: (4,4) to (5,8) is 4 steps. Not immediate.  \n\nActually, looking at board: (4,4) is enemy head, (5,8) is apple. Enemy could move toward it.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,7), next turn only DOWN to (9,6), then from (9,6) maybe more options open? Possibly, but still very constrained by right wall and my own body.  \n\nGiven that both moves lead to only one safe follow-up, I choose the one that gains an apple and extends my lead, hoping enemy doesn\u2019t block my only escape next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (9,9) and eating apple, next turn must go LEFT to (8,9). From there, assess: possible moves from (8,9) will be UP (off), DOWN (body), LEFT (7,9) empty, RIGHT (9,9) body. So LEFT to (7,9) likely. Then from (7,9) maybe more options. Try to work my way toward left side apples (0,9) or (0,7) while avoiding enemy.  \n\nUP",

Wait, check: my body list after head: (4,9) is directly behind, then (4,8) is second segment. (3,8) is not in body list? Actually scan: (4,8) is at y=8 x=4, not (3,8). So (3,8) is empty? Let\u2019s verify: body cells: (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). (3,8) is not in that list. So DOWN is safe? But careful: moving DOWN from (3,9) to (3,8) is not directly backwards because my neck is at (4,9), not (3,8). So DOWN is safe unless enemy body is there. Check enemy body: Snake #0 body: [(8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)] \u2014 no (3,8).

DOWN (8,2) empty. LEFT (7,3) enemy body \u2192 fatal. RIGHT (9,3) empty.  \nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 possible next heads: (8,2), (9,3).  \n\nMy safe moves:  \n- DOWN to (3,8): far from (8,2) and (9,3) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT to (2,9): far from enemy \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (1,5), (0,9), (0,7), (1,1), (3,0)  \n\nFrom (3,9):  \n- DOWN to (3,8): Manhattan to (0,9)= |3-0|+|8-9|=3+1=4, to (0,7)= |3-0|+|8-7|=3+1=4, to (1,5)= |3-1|+|8-5|=2+3=5.  \n- LEFT to (2,9): to (0,9)=2, to (0,7)= |2-0|+|9-7|=2+2=4.  \n\nLEFT is slightly closer to (0,9).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \n\nIf LEFT to (2,9):  \nNew body: [(2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] (tail removed).  \n\nFrom (2,9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT (two options).

Check body: (3,6) is at y=6, so (3,7) is free.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT (two options). Also good.  \n\nBoth give two safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI\u2019m at top edge. LEFT continues along top edge toward apple (0,9). DOWN moves me down toward center, possibly toward other apples later. Enemy is at (8,3) moving down/right, likely toward (3,0) apple. I have 3 more apples than enemy. If I can grab (0,9) and (0,7) while staying safe, I extend lead.  \n\nBut going LEFT to (2,9) then next turn I can go LEFT to (1,9) then DOWN to (1,8) toward (0,7) or (1,5). That seems viable.  \n\nGoing DOWN now to (3,8) leaves me more central, but top apples may be harder to reach later.  \n\nGiven my lead, maybe play safe and keep options open. DOWN gives more space. LEFT edges me toward a corner but with two exits next turn.  \n\nCheck enemy possible moves: enemy might go to (8,2) or (9,3). Neither threatens me immediately.  \n\nI think LEFT toward (0,9) is slightly more aggressive for apple, but still safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,9), choose DOWN to (2,8) to avoid top-edge trap, then work toward (0,7) or (1,5). Keep checking enemy\u2019s distance.  \n\nLEFT",

Good.\n\nBoth keep two safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have a 3-apple lead. Enemy is far away in lower right. Apple (0,9) is reachable in two moves if I go LEFT now and LEFT next turn. That would extend my lead and is safe because enemy cannot threaten that corner quickly. After eating (0,9), I can go DOWN toward (0,7) or (1,5).  \n\nGoing DOWN now keeps me more central but delays eating top apples. Since I\u2019m ahead, securing nearby apples while staying safe is good.  \n\nLEFT toward (0,9) is aggressive but safe and gives me an apple next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,9), go LEFT to (0,9) to eat apple, then next turn exit DOWN to (0,8) toward (0,7) or (1,5). Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s movement toward (3,0).\n\nLEFT",

Moves away from most apples.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have a 3-apple lead. Enemy is far away (bottom left area).  \nGoal: collect apples safely while maintaining options.  \nDOWN to (1,7) gives most next-move options and puts me 1 step from (0,7) apple, also close to (1,5).  \nLEFT to (0,8) also good but slightly more constrained next turn (only 2 moves, both eat apple).  \nRIGHT is less ideal (farther from apples).  \n\nI prefer DOWN now:  \n- It keeps me centered with 3 exits next turn.  \n- Next turn I can go LEFT to (0,7) to eat apple, or DOWN to (1,6) toward (1,5), or RIGHT to (2,7) to explore.  \n- Avoids trapping myself against left wall prematurely.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,7), likely go LEFT to (0,7) to eat apple, unless enemy moves into that area.

Check: (2, 9) is body, (2, 8) not in body now, but after move, old head (1, 7) becomes body, so (2, 8) still free. Wait, actually body after move: head to (2, 7), old body shifts, (1, 8) becomes first body segment, (1, 9) second, etc. So (2, 8) not in body. So UP safe.  \n- DOWN (2, 6) free.  \n- LEFT (1, 7) my body (old head) \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT (3, 7) free.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have a 3-apple lead. Enemy is far away near bottom left.  \nLEFT (0, 7) eats apple now but next turn only 2 safe moves, both along left wall.  \nDOWN (1, 6) gives 3 safe moves next turn and puts me 1 step from (1, 5) apple.  \nRIGHT (2, 7) moves away from most apples.  \n\nI prefer DOWN:  \n- Keeps flexibility.  \n- Next turn I can eat (1, 5) apple safely.  \n- Avoids trapping myself on left wall too early.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), likely go DOWN to (1, 5) to eat apple unless enemy moves into that area. Keep monitoring enemy movement toward (3, 0) apple. Maintain lead.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait: enemy UP \u2192 (2, 2), my RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 not same cell, so no direct collision. But check if enemy could move into my new head next turn? No, enemy moves this turn simultaneously, so only worry is if we end up in same cell now. That\u2019s impossible here.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 9), (0, 7), (1, 1), (3, 0), (3, 7)  \n\nFrom (1, 3):  \n- DOWN (1, 2) \u2192 distance to (1, 1) = 1 (next turn eat if go DOWN again).  \n- LEFT (0, 3) \u2192 distance to (0, 7) = 4, to (0, 9) = 6.  \n- RIGHT (2, 3) \u2192 distance to (3, 7) = 4, to (3, 0) = 3.  \n\nClosest apple is (1, 1) via DOWN.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 2):  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP (1, 3) \u2192 my old head? Wait, old head (1, 3) will be body after move, so UP into body \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN (1, 1) \u2192 free (apple).  \n- LEFT (0, 2) \u2192 free.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2) \u2192 free.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good.  \n\nIf LEFT to (0, 3):  \nFrom (0, 3):  \n- UP (0, 4) \u2192 free.  \n- DOWN (0, 2) \u2192 free.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT (1, 3) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 fatal.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options). Less flexible.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (2, 3):  \nFrom (2, 3):  \n- UP (2, 4) \u2192 free.  \n- DOWN (2, 2) \u2192 free.  \n- LEFT (1, 3) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3) \u2192 free.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Good.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy apple threat**  \nEnemy at (2, 1) can eat (1, 1) apple by going LEFT this turn. If I go DOWN to (1, 2), I can eat (1, 1) next turn only if enemy doesn\u2019t eat it now. But if enemy eats it now, they grow, and I\u2019m at (1, 2) with no apple there. That\u2019s fine \u2014 I avoid collision and still have options.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1, 1), their new head is (1, 1), body includes old (2, 1) etc. Then my DOWN to (1, 2) is safe (not adjacent to enemy head after their move? Wait: enemy at (1, 1) is adjacent diagonally to (1, 2) \u2014 not same cell, so fine). Next turn if I go DOWN to (1, 1), that\u2019s enemy head now \u2192 fatal. So I\u2019d avoid that.  \n\nSo if enemy eats (1, 1) now, I\u2019ll just change plan next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI\u2019m ahead 18 vs 14. Securing (1, 1) apple is good if possible, but not worth risking collision. DOWN seems safe and keeps options open.  \n\nLEFT reduces future moves. RIGHT moves toward center but away from immediate apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), check if (1, 1) is occupied by enemy. If yes, avoid DOWN, maybe go LEFT/RIGHT to open area. If no, eat it. Keep flexibility.  \n\nDOWN",

No, enemy head is at (1, 1) now? Wait, enemy head is (1, 1) from last turn? Let\u2019s check: enemy head given as (1, 1), body starts with (2, 1). So (1, 1) is enemy head, not body. Moving into enemy head is not allowed? Actually rule: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d Enemy head is not body, so moving into (1, 1) is not automatically fatal unless it\u2019s a head-on collision (simultaneous move). But if enemy stays there, I\u2019d die next turn? No, they move now too. Let\u2019s check later.)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n\nSo UP is unsafe (own body). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are not obviously fatal from static board.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy collision risk**  \nEnemy head: (1, 1)  \nEnemy possible moves:  \nFrom (1, 1):  \nUP (1, 2) \u2192 my head currently at (1, 2) \u2192 if enemy goes UP and I go DOWN, we swap? Wait, if enemy goes UP to (1, 2) and I go DOWN to (1, 1), we swap heads \u2192 both die (head-on collision).  \nDOWN (1, 0) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT (0, 1) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (2, 1) \u2192 enemy body at (2, 1) \u2192 fatal for enemy.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nNow check my safe moves vs enemy possible moves:  \n- My DOWN to (1, 1): enemy could go DOWN to (1, 0) or LEFT to (0, 1). If enemy goes DOWN, I go to (1, 1) and enemy goes to (1, 0) \u2192 no collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (0, 1), I go to (1, 1) \u2192 no collision. So DOWN is safe from head-on this turn.  \n- My LEFT to (0, 2): enemy possible heads: (1, 0), (0, 1) \u2192 not (0, 2) \u2192 safe.  \n- My RIGHT to (2, 2): enemy possible heads: (1, 0), (0, 1) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo all three moves avoid head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 9), (0, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (2, 4)  \n\nFrom (1, 2):  \n- DOWN (1, 1) \u2192 no apple.  \n- LEFT (0, 2) \u2192 closest apple (0, 7) distance 5.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2) \u2192 closest apple (2, 4) distance 2, (3, 7) distance 5.  \n\nClosest reachable apple is (2, 4) via RIGHT then UP.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 1):  \nFrom (1, 1):  \nUP (1, 2) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 fatal.  \nDOWN (1, 0) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT (0, 1) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (2, 1) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\nIf LEFT to (0, 2):  \nFrom (0, 2):  \nUP (0, 3) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN (0, 1) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT (1, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (2, 2):  \nFrom (2, 2):  \nUP (2, 3) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN (2, 1) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT (1, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT (3, 2) \u2192 free.  \nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nAll give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy apple threat**  \nEnemy at (1, 1) can\u2019t eat any apple this turn (no apple at (1, 0) or (0, 1)).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI\u2019m ahead 18 vs 15. Securing (2, 4) apple soon is good. RIGHT now gets me closer. Also, moving RIGHT avoids staying near enemy head (1, 1) which could limit my future moves.  \n\nLEFT and DOWN both lead to edges, reducing flexibility later. RIGHT moves toward center and apple path.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 2), if apple at (2, 4) still there, consider UP then UP to get it, but check enemy possible moves (enemy will be at (1, 0) or (0, 1) likely). Keep space.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, enemy body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), \u2026] yes (2, 1) is in enemy body \u2192 so UP fatal for enemy.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, -1) \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 0) \u2192 enemy body (first segment after head?) Actually enemy body list: head (2, 0), then (1, 0) is second segment \u2192 so LEFT into own body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 0) \u2192 free (apple there).  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (3, 0).  \n\nNow check my safe moves vs enemy\u2019s possible head position after move:  \n- My UP to (2, 4): enemy head to (3, 0) \u2192 no collision.  \n- My RIGHT to (3, 3): enemy head to (3, 0) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nBoth safe from head-on this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 9), (0, 7), (3, 0), (3, 7), (2, 4)  \n\nFrom my head (2, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 apple! Eat immediately this turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 closest apple (3, 0) distance 3, (3, 7) distance 4.  \n\nUP gets apple now, grows to length 19.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \n\nIf UP to (2, 4) and eat apple:  \nNew length 19, tail stays where it was (no tail removed). Body: new head (2, 4), then old head (2, 3), then rest of body as before, tail still (7, 9).  \n\nFrom (2, 4) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 free.  \n\nSo safe moves next turn: UP, RIGHT.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3, 3) and no apple:  \nFrom (3, 3):  \nUP \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 free? Check enemy body: (3, 1) is enemy body, not (3, 2) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 free.  \n\nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nBut RIGHT gives no apple now, and enemy will eat apple at (3, 0) this turn (since enemy\u2019s only move is RIGHT into apple). That gives enemy 16 apples vs my 18. If I take (2, 4) now, I get 19 apples, enemy 16.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI\u2019m ahead, but enemy is trapped? Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s situation after eating apple at (3, 0):  \nEnemy head moves to (3, 0), grows to length 16, body includes old head (2, 0) as second segment.  \nFrom (3, 0) enemy\u2019s next turn moves:  \nUP \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 fatal.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 free.  \n\nSo enemy will have only RIGHT to (4, 0) next turn \u2014 very constrained, possibly heading toward bottom right open area but far from apples.  \n\nIf I take apple at (2, 4), I\u2019ll be at 19 apples, enemy 16. I\u2019ll have safe moves UP or RIGHT next turn. The board\u2019s top-left area where I am is getting tight because my body fills rows 1\u20132 in many columns. After eating (2, 4), I should plan to move toward more open space \u2014 maybe UP to (2, 5) then right toward (3, 5) etc., or go RIGHT immediately next turn to (3, 4) to start moving across the middle.  \n\nBut importantly, taking apple now puts me closer to 30, and enemy is limited in movement, so I should capitalize.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of trap**  \nGoing UP to (2, 4) leaves me with 2 safe moves next turn, which is fine. Going RIGHT leaves 3 safe moves but loses the apple and lets enemy eat one. Since enemy is forced into a narrow path, I can afford to be a bit less flexible short-term if it gains me an apple lead.\n\nGiven I\u2019m ahead and enemy is constrained, securing the apple now is best.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 4), choose UP to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 4) depending on enemy\u2019s position (enemy will be at (3, 0) \u2192 (4, 0) likely). Prefer moving to open area rightwards to avoid boxing myself in top-left.\n\nUP",

Eat immediately.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 no apple, closest apples: (3,7) distance 3, (5,0) distance 5.  \n\nUP gets apple now, grows to length 20.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \nIf UP to (2,5) and eat apple:  \nNew length 20, tail stays (no tail removed). Body: new head (2,5), old head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), tail (8,9).  \n\nFrom (2,5) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 free.  \n\nSo safe moves next turn: UP, RIGHT (2 safe moves).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3,4) and no apple:  \nFrom (3,4):  \nUP \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 free.  \n\nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nBut RIGHT loses the apple at (2,5) now, and enemy will likely eat (5,0) soon (enemy head moving to (4,0) this turn, then can go to (5,0) next turn if safe).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have 19 apples, enemy has 16. If I eat (2,5) \u2192 20 apples, enemy 16. Enemy is constrained to bottom row for now: from (4,0) next turn, enemy\u2019s only safe moves will be RIGHT to (5,0) (apple) or possibly UP if (4,1) is free? Let\u2019s check: enemy body at (4,1) currently, but after enemy moves to (4,0) and tail moves (since no apple eaten this turn), (4,1) may become free next turn? Wait: enemy ate apple last turn at (3,0), so tail didn\u2019t move last turn. This turn enemy moves to (4,0) without eating apple, so tail (7,4) moves, freeing (7,4). But (4,1) is still occupied by enemy body (segment after head). So from (4,0) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 apple, free.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move next turn is RIGHT to (5,0) (apple). Enemy will then grow to 17 apples, tail stays.  \n\nThus enemy will be at (5,0) with 17 apples next turn, still stuck along bottom row.  \n\nI should take apple now to extend lead to 20 vs 16 (soon 17). Even though UP leaves me with only 2 safe moves next turn, both lead to relatively open areas:  \n- UP from (2,5) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 then maybe right to (3,6) toward apple (3,7).  \n- RIGHT from (2,5) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 then up to (3,6) toward apple (3,7).  \n\nI can start moving right across row 5 or 6 to avoid boxing myself in left side.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe this turn. UP gets apple and extends lead but reduces next-turn options slightly. RIGHT keeps more next-turn options but loses apple lead. Given enemy is trapped on bottom row for at least 2 more turns, I can afford to take the apple now and maneuver out of the top-left congestion.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,5), choose UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5) depending on enemy position (enemy will be at (5,0)). Prefer moving rightwards to open space.\n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 enemy ate apple at (3,0) last turn, so tail didn\u2019t move last turn. This turn enemy moves to (4,0) without eating apple, so tail (7,4) moves, freeing (7,4). Next turn enemy moves to (5,0) and eats apple, so tail won\u2019t move next turn.  \n\nSo enemy will be stuck along bottom row for at least 1 more turn after next.  \n\nI want to get apples (3,7) or (4,6) before enemy can reach them. From (2,6) I can go RIGHT to (3,6) then UP to (3,7). From (3,5) I can go UP to (3,6) then UP to (3,7) or RIGHT to (4,5) then UP to (4,6).  \n\nRIGHT to (3,5) gives more next-turn options and is closer to both apples.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nBoth safe this turn. RIGHT gives more flexibility and moves toward apples. UP keeps me near left wall with fewer options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,5), choose UP to (3,6) to approach apple (3,7) while keeping DOWN and RIGHT as backups. Avoid moving left into my body.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy is far from apples (3,7) and (4,6) for now.  \n\nI want to secure apples while keeping options open. UP to (3,6) gives me next turn a choice between apple at (3,7) or (4,6) and also LEFT to (2,6) as escape. RIGHT to (4,5) also gives apple access next turn but slightly less flexible if enemy later approaches from below.  \n\nUP seems best: puts me in position to take (3,7) next turn while keeping both apples in reach.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nAll three moves safe this turn. DOWN moves away from apples and reduces options. UP and RIGHT both good, but UP gives slightly more central position relative to both apples and escape routes.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,6), if apple at (3,7) still there, take it (UP). If not, consider RIGHT to (4,6) if apple there, else LEFT to (2,6) to stay safe. Avoid moving into my body.\n\nUP",

Check: My tail is at (8, 3) now so after moving, head goes to (9, 0), body becomes: new segment head=(9, 0), then body segments shift \u2014 last segment (8,3) gets cut off (since apples eaten=17 and body length=18 \u2014 yes length after move: if no apple eaten, length stays 18 but last segment (8,3) is removed, and (7,0) becomes last body segment? Wait, check: current body length = number of body coords (17) +1 head = 18 total segments. After move without apple, head moves, all segments shift, last tail segment removed. So tail will be at (7, 1) moving to (1, 0) etc.? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body: head=(8,0), then (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) tail.  \nMove right to (9,0): new body: head (9,0), then old head (8,0) is first body segment, then (7,0), (6,0), \u2026 up to (8,2) is second-last, (8,3) is dropped. So tail will be at (8,2). That means at next turn, my body will occupy: (9,0) head, (8,0), (7,0), \u2026 so LEFT from (9,0) is (8,0) \u2014 which is my body segment \u2192 unsafe next turn. So only UP is safe next turn. That\u2019s okay.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple access planning**  \nApples: closest reachable perhaps is (9,6) via going up right edge. That\u2019s 6 moves up from (9,0) with potential risks, but no other route from here safely without hitting self in near future. Need to move along edge to find space.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan for next turn**  \nThis turn: RIGHT to (9, 0). Next turn: UP to (9, 1), then try to traverse up the right side, maybe head toward (9, 6) apple or (8, 9). But must check that enemy snake #1 body blocks top-left region.  \n\nRIGHT",

Now I need to check safe moves.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves check**  \n- UP: (9, 1) \u2013 Check the board: at (9,1), is there anything? From the board state, (9,1) is empty (no body or enemy). Wait, my body: after moving, my new body segments will be: head (9,0), then (8,0), (7,0), ... up to tail at (8,2). So (9,1) is not in my body. Enemy snake #1 body is far away. So UP is safe.  \n- DOWN: (9, -1) \u2013 off board, invalid.  \n- LEFT: (8, 0) \u2013 That\u2019s my body segment (the first segment behind head). So unsafe.  \n- RIGHT: (10, 0) \u2013 off board, invalid.\n\nSo only UP is safe this turn.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat check**  \nEnemy snake #1 head is at (4, 6). Manhattan distance to (9,0) is |4-9| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11. No immediate danger.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options after UP**  \nIf I move UP to (9,1):  \nNext turn, from (9,1):  \n- UP: (9,2) \u2013 empty now, should be safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- DOWN: (9,0) \u2013 will that be my body? After this move, my body shifts: new head (9,1), then (9,0), (8,0), ... tail at (8,2). So (9,0) is my body segment, so DOWN would be unsafe next turn.  \n- LEFT: (8,1) \u2013 currently, is that occupied? My body has (8,1) as a segment? Current body after move: (9,0) becomes body, so (8,1) is not in the new body? Let's list new body after moving UP to (9,1):  \n  Head: (9,1)  \n  Body: (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2) \u2013 wait, tail was (8,2) before, and we drop the last segment (8,3) since no apple eaten. So yes, (8,1) is in my body (the second-last segment). So LEFT to (8,1) would be unsafe next turn.  \n- RIGHT: off board.\n\nSo next turn, only UP from (9,1) would be safe. That\u2019s a bit risky, but I have to take it now.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple access**  \nApples at: (0,9), (0,7), (8,9), (9,6), (8,8). The closest is (9,6) \u2013 5 moves UP from here. But I need to navigate along the right edge. Since only UP is safe now, I should go UP and then try to continue UP next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m trapped along the right edge. My body blocks LEFT and DOWN, so I must go UP repeatedly until I reach the top. At (9,6) there\u2019s an apple, and (8,9) and (9,6) are nearby. I need to avoid hitting myself as I move up. The enemy is far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nPlan: Move UP now, then UP again next turn if possible. Once near the top, I can consider LEFT to get apples, but must check body positions.\n\nSince only UP is safe, I have no choice.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

For now, from (8,6) next turn:  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nAll three give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nApples at (8,9), (9,6), (8,8) are in the top-right.  \nRIGHT to (8,6) puts me closer to (9,6) and (8,8)/(8,9) via UP later.  \nEnemy is far away at bottom-right, but moving up slowly.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT to continue toward apples while keeping options open.  \nFrom (8,6) next turn, I can go RIGHT to eat (9,6) apple if safe, or UP toward (8,8) apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,6), check if (9,6) is safe (no enemy head collision risk) and consider eating it. If not safe, go UP toward (8,8) or DOWN to avoid dead ends. Keep multiple safe moves open.  \n\nRIGHT",

If unsafe, go LEFT to (7,7) or RIGHT to (9,7) to keep options open.  \n\nUP",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN**: (9, 5) \u2013 That\u2019s my body segment (second segment after head). Unsafe.  \n- **LEFT**: (8, 6) \u2013 Empty now. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT**: Off board \u2192 Unsafe.  \n\nSo **UP** and **LEFT** are safe.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat check**  \nEnemy snake #1 head at (8, 8). Manhattan distance to my head (9, 6) = 1 + 2 = 3.  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP: (8, 9) \u2013 empty now, safe for them.  \n- DOWN: (8, 7) \u2013 their body segment? Wait, check: their body is [(8, 7), (8, 6), \u2026]. So (8, 7) is their body segment \u2192 unsafe for them.  \n- LEFT: (7, 8) \u2013 empty now, safe for them.  \n- RIGHT: (9, 8) \u2013 empty now, safe for them.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nThey could move RIGHT to (9, 8) \u2014 that\u2019s 2 away from my head (9, 6). No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple access**  \nApples: (0, 9), (0, 7), (8, 9), (7, 7), (4, 9).  \n\nFrom (9, 6):  \n- UP to (9, 7) \u2192 no apple.  \n- LEFT to (8, 6) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nClosest apple: (8, 9) is 3 moves away (LEFT + UP + UP).  \n(7, 7) is 3 moves away (LEFT + LEFT + DOWN? Actually from (9,6): LEFT to (8,6), LEFT to (7,6), DOWN to (7,5)? Wait, no, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 apple at (7,7) is UP from (7,6). So path: LEFT to (8,6), LEFT to (7,6), UP to (7,7). Yes, 3 moves.)  \n\nAlso (4, 9) is far. (0, 9) very far.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (9, 7):  \nNext turn, my body will be: head (9, 7), then (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), \u2026, tail at (4, 1).  \nFrom (9, 7):  \n- UP: (9, 8) \u2013 empty now, safe.  \n- DOWN: (9, 6) \u2013 will be my body segment next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT: (8, 7) \u2013 empty now, safe.  \n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn I\u2019ll have UP and LEFT as safe moves.  \n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (8, 6):  \nNext turn, my body will be: head (8, 6), then (9, 6), (9, 5), \u2026, tail at (4, 1).  \nFrom (8, 6):  \n- UP: (8, 7) \u2013 empty now, safe.  \n- DOWN: (8, 5) \u2013 will be my body segment next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT: (7, 6) \u2013 empty now, safe.  \n- RIGHT: (9, 6) \u2013 will be my body segment next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo next turn I\u2019ll have UP and LEFT as safe moves.  \n\nBoth moves give 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 23 apples, I have 18. Need to catch up.  \nMoving LEFT gets me closer to apples (8, 9) and (7, 7). Moving UP doesn\u2019t get me closer to any apple immediately but might set up for future.  \nLEFT seems better for apple chasing. Also, enemy head at (8, 8) \u2014 if I go LEFT to (8, 6), enemy could go DOWN to (8, 7) next turn, blocking my UP from (8, 6)? But that\u2019s fine, I\u2019d still have LEFT safe.  \n\nActually, enemy might move toward apples too. (8, 9) apple is close to enemy \u2014 they might go UP to (8, 9) this turn. If I go LEFT to (8, 6), next turn I could go UP to (8, 7) if enemy leaves it open, then to (8, 8) or (7, 7).  \n\nLEFT seems strategically better for catching apples.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

Actually LEFT to (8,6) is fatal for them, so only truly safe for them is UP to (9,7).  \n\nCheck my safe moves vs enemy\u2019s possible new head (9,7):  \n- My UP to (8,9): enemy at (9,7) \u2192 no collision.  \n- My LEFT to (7,8): enemy at (9,7) \u2192 no collision.  \n- My RIGHT to (9,8): enemy at (9,7) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nAll safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0,9), (0,7), (8,9), (7,7), (4,9)  \nFrom my head (8,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 apple!  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 no apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nUP eats apple immediately (score 24).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move**  \n\nIf UP to (8,9) (eat apple):  \nGrow by 1, tail stays, body length increases by 1.  \nNew head (8,9), body: head (8,9), then (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9).  \n\nFrom (8,9) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2192 free.  \n\nSafe next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (2 safe moves).  \n\nIf LEFT to (7,8) (no apple):  \nTail (3,9) removed, body: head (7,8), then (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9).  \n\nFrom (7,8) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 apple there, free now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n\nSafe next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 safe moves).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,8) (no apple):  \nTail (3,9) removed, body: head (9,8), then (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9).  \n\nFrom (9,8) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (9,9) \u2192 free.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 free (unless enemy moves there this turn, but that\u2019s this turn\u2019s enemy head location, not next turn\u2019s body). Wait, enemy head at (9,7) after this turn, so next turn (9,7) will be enemy body? Actually enemy moves this turn to (9,7) likely, so next turn (9,7) is enemy body segment \u2192 fatal for me to go into. So DOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \n\nSafe next turn: UP only (1 safe move).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives immediate apple (score 24) but leaves only 2 safe moves next turn, both along top edge.  \nLEFT gives no apple but 3 safe moves next turn, including access to apple at (7,7) next turn.  \nRIGHT gives no apple and only 1 safe move next turn (dangerous).  \n\nGiven I\u2019m ahead in apples (24 vs 18) and game ends at 30, eating apple now gets me closer to win. However, being trapped at top edge with only 2 moves next turn is risky if enemy can approach.  \n\nBut enemy is far away at (9,7) after this turn, so I\u2019ll have time to escape top row next turn via LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nAlso, if I go LEFT now, enemy could move toward center and block me from apples.  \n\nBest to take apple now: UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,9), choose LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9) depending on enemy position. Prefer LEFT to stay away from enemy at (9,7).  \n\nUP",
