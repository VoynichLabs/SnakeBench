The current board state is now updated with your snake's new head position at (5, 2) and the enemy's last known position. The enemy's head will move on this turn, but we don't know its new position yet. We must assume the worst-case scenario for collision avoidance.)*\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 2):\n1. **UP:** (5, 3)\n2. **DOWN:** (5, 1) \u2014 This would move your head backward into your own body (tail at (5, 1)), so it is invalid.\n3. **LEFT:** (4, 2)\n4. **RIGHT:** (6, 2)\n\n### Safety Check:\n- **DOWN** is invalid (backward collision).\n- **UP** to (5, 3) is safe (no body collisions, no immediate enemy threat).\n- **LEFT** to (4, 2) is safe (no body collisions, no immediate enemy threat).\n- **RIGHT** to (6, 2) is safe (no body collisions, no immediate enemy threat).\n\n### Apple Reachability:\n- The closest apple is at (5, 4), which is **1 unit up** from your current position.\n  - Moving **UP** to (5, 3) would place you **1 unit away** from (5, 4), making it reachable in the next turn.\n- Other apples are farther away:\n  - (1, 2) is 4 units left and 0 units up (same row).\n  - (6, 5) is 1 unit right and 3 units up.\n  - (7, 3) is 2 units right and 1 unit up.\n  - (9, 8) is far away (4 units right and 6 units up).\n\n### Enemy Movement:\n- The enemy snake is at (5, 8) with its body at (5, 9). Its head could move in any of 4 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) on this turn.\n- The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat, but we must ensure we don\u2019t move into a position where it could trap us or cause a head-on collision in the future.\n- The enemy\u2019s body is at (5, 9), so its head cannot move to (5, 9) again (backward collision). However, it could move to (5, 7), (6, 8), (4, 8), or (5, 9) (invalid, as it would hit its own body).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- The apple at (5, 4) is the closest and most accessible. Moving **UP** to (5, 3) allows you to reach it in the next turn.\n- If you move **LEFT** to (4, 2), you would be moving away from (5, 4) but closer to (1, 2). However, this is less optimal for reaching the closest apple.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 2) is safe but moves you away from (5, 4) and toward (6, 5), which is not as close.\n- Avoid moving into dead-ends or positions that limit future options. For example, moving too far left could eventually trap you near the edge of the board.\n\n### Move Selection:\n- **UP** to (5, 3) is the best immediate move because:\n  - It places you **1 unit away** from the apple at (5, 4), allowing you to collect it in the next turn.\n  - It keeps open paths to other apples if needed.\n  - It doesn\u2019t immediately limit future options.\n  - The enemy is far away and unlikely to interfere in the next few turns.\n\n### Future Strategy Note:\n- Next turn, prioritize moving **UP** again to (5, 4) to collect the closest apple.\n- Monitor the enemy\u2019s movement to ensure it doesn\u2019t cut off your path or cause a collision.\n- If the enemy moves toward you, avoid head-on collisions and maintain safe distance.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at (6, 5) as it could become more accessible if you move rightward in the future.\n\nUP",

If we move UP, we will collect it next turn if we move UP again.\n- **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (6, 6). If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 5), we would collide. However, the enemy is unlikely to move directly into our path unless it is also targeting the apple. Given its current position, it would need to move DOWN twice in a row to reach (6, 5), which is possible but not guaranteed.\n- **Risk:** If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 5) next turn, we would collide. However, the enemy is more likely to move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid collision with its own body (at (5, 6)).\n- **Safety:** Moving UP to (6, 5) is safe if the enemy does not move DOWN. If it does, we would die, but this is a low-probability scenario given the enemy's current position and body orientation.\n\n#### **DOWN (6, 3):**\n- **No Apple:** No apple at (6, 3), and it moves us away from the closest apple at (6, 5).\n- **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (6, 6). Moving DOWN does not directly threaten the enemy, but it also does not help us collect any apple.\n- **Future Options:** Moving DOWN could eventually lead us to (6, 0), where there is an apple, but this is less optimal than collecting (6, 5) first.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7, 4):**\n- **No Apple:** No apple at (7, 4), and it moves us away from the closest apple at (6, 5).\n- **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (6, 6). Moving RIGHT does not directly threaten the enemy, but it also does not help us collect any apple.\n- **Future Options:** Moving RIGHT could eventually lead us to (7, 3), where there is an apple, but this is less optimal than collecting (6, 5) first.\n\n---\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction:\n- The enemy is at (6, 6) with body at (5, 6). Its possible moves are:\n  - UP: (6, 7) \u2192 **invalid** (off-board)\n  - DOWN: (6, 5)\n  - LEFT: (5, 6) \u2192 **invalid** (own body)\n  - RIGHT: (7, 6)\n\nThus, the enemy can only move DOWN to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (7, 6). Moving DOWN to (6, 5) would threaten us if we move UP to (6, 5) this turn, but moving RIGHT to (7, 6) is also possible.\n\nGiven the enemy's current position and body orientation, it is more likely to move RIGHT to (7, 6) to avoid collision with its own body (at (5, 6)). Moving DOWN to (6, 5) would require it to move into a position that could lead to a collision with us if we move UP, but this is less likely because it would be moving directly into our path.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- **Collect (6, 5):** Moving UP to (6, 5) this turn positions us to collect the apple next turn if we move UP again. The risk of collision with the enemy is low because the enemy is unlikely to move DOWN to (6, 5) next turn.\n- **Avoid Traps:** Moving UP keeps our snake's body flexible and avoids getting trapped in tight spaces.\n- **Prioritize Closest Apple:** Collecting (6, 5) is the most efficient move, as it increases our score and keeps us competitive.\n\n---\n\n### Move Selection:\n**UP** to (6, 5) is the best move because:\n- It maximizes our chance of collecting the closest apple next turn.\n- The risk of collision with the enemy is low, as the enemy is unlikely to move DOWN to (6, 5) next turn.\n- It keeps our snake's movement flexible and avoids immediate threats.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Next turn, move UP again to (6, 6) to collect the apple at (6, 5).\n- Monitor the enemy's movement to (7, 6) or (6, 5) and adjust accordingly.\n- If the enemy moves to (6, 5), we will die, but this is a low-probability scenario.\n- After collecting (6, 5), reassess the board for the next closest apple and plan accordingly.\n\n---\nUP",
