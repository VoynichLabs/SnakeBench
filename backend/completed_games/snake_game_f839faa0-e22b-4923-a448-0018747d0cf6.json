Enemy Collision Check:**\nEnemy head is at (5, 7).\nIf I move to (2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 4), or (3, 4), I will not collide with the enemy head (5, 7) this turn, as they are far away.\n\n**3.

To reach (2, 6) from (2, 4) in the minimum number of moves, I must move UP twice.\n\n**4. Evaluating Moves based on Apple Target (2, 6):**\n\n*   **UP (2, 5):** Moves one step closer to the closest apple (2, 6). This is a very direct and safe move.\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Moves away from the closest apple. Not ideal.\n*   **LEFT (1, 4):** Moves horizontally away from the target column (x=2).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Moves horizontally toward the apples at y=4 (A4 at (6,4) or A1 at (7,4)), but farther from the closest apple (A2 at (2,6)).\n\n**5. Considering Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at (5, 7)):**\nThe enemy at (5, 7) will also move this turn. We don't know its preferred move, but it is generally aiming for apples or survival. It is far from us.\n\nSince UP leads directly to the closest apple in the next turn (if the apple remains), and it is completely safe, UP is the optimal choice for this early stage.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Focus on the closest apple ((2, 6)) until it is eaten or blocked, maintaining safety.\n\nMy move will be UP.\n\nUP",

For the purpose of calculating safety for *my* current move, I must assume the enemy might move optimally or conservatively. Since I only see the results from the *previous* turn's calculation (your snake moved UP, landing at (2,5)), I must now analyze the board state provided above and determine the *next* move.\n\n**Board State Analysis (Turn 2 input):**\nMy head is (2, 5). My body trailed is (2, 4).\nEnemy head is (6, 7).\nApples: (7, 4), (2, 6), (8, 6), (6, 4), (5, 6).\nClosest apple is (2, 6). Distance 1 (UP).\n\n**1. Safety Check (Self-Collision & Bounds):**\nCurrent position (2, 5). Previous segment (2, 4). The cell *behind* the head (i.e., where the tail was, but since the snake grew, the previous head position (2, 4) is now the first body segment) is not relevant for immediate backward collision unless the snake shrinks, which it doesn't upon eating an apple (it only grows). My tail is at (2, 4). Moving backward into (2, 4) is generally illegal *if the snake were longer or moving in a way that looped*. Since I only have 2 segments, I cannot move backward into (2, 4) unless I move DOWN.\n\n*   Bounds: All moves are safe from boundary collision.\n*   Self-Collision:\n    *   UP (2, 6): Safe (unless Apple (2, 6) is there, which is true). If I move to (2, 6), I eat the apple, and my new body will be (2, 6), (2, 5). (2, 4) remains the tail. Safe.\n    *   DOWN (2, 4): **Unsafe**. This moves my head onto my own body segment (2, 4). This move is illegal.\n    *   LEFT (1, 5): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (3, 5): Safe.\n\n**2. Enemy Collision Check (Snake #0 at (6, 7)):**\nThe enemy head is at (6, 7). None of my safe moves ((2, 6) (Apple), (1, 5), (3, 5)) intersect with (6, 7).\n\n**3. Apple Targeting:**\nThe closest apple is (2, 6), distance 1 UP.\n\n**4. Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (2, 6):** Moves directly to and consumes the closest apple. This is the highest priority objective when safe. After eating, my snake will be (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4). Safe and rewarding.\n*   **LEFT (1, 5):** Moves away from the closest apple.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 5):** Moves away from the closest apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (2, 6) is the optimal move as it achieves the primary goal (eating the closest apple) while being completely safe (no self-collision, no boundary issue, no predicted enemy collision).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving towards apples unless safety dictates otherwise. Since I am short, I have open pathways. The immediate goal is to consume (2, 6).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

My head is now at (1, 6). My body is (2, 6). I did not eat an apple.\nSnake #0's last position was (7, 6). It is moving simultaneously.\n\n**Board State Analysis (Turn 4 input):**\nMy head: (1, 6). My body: (2, 6). Length 2.\nEnemy #0 head: (7, 6). Length 1 (no body yet, they just start or only have 1 point so far). Wait, reviewing my previous turn's input:\nTurn 3 Input Info: Snake #0 Head: (7, 6), Body: none, Apples: 0. (This means Snake #0 has length 1).\nTurn 3 Board State: ... 6 . 1 T . . A . 0 A . (Snake #0 is at (7, 6)).\n\nTurn 3 Output Info (My previous rationalized move): LEFT.\nThis means that after my move LEFT, the game state became:\nMy Head: (1, 6), Body: (2, 6). (I moved 1 step Left from (2, 6)).\n\nNow, we need to simulate Snake #0's move. Since I don't know Snake #0's move from the previous turn (it happens simultaneously with mine), I must rely on the provided *input* for Turn 4.\n\n**Turn 4 Input State:**\nMy Head: (1, 6), Body: [(2, 6)]. Score 1 (1 apple collected previously).\nEnemy #0 Head: (7, 6). Score 0.\nApples: (7, 4), (8, 6), (6, 4), (5, 6), (0, 8).\n\n*Crucially, I need to determine what move Snake #0 made to arrive at (7, 6) if it was previously somewhere else, or if it stayed at (7, 6).*\nThe input only shows the *current* position of the enemy snake *before* my move this turn. This implies the enemy has executed its move from Turn 3 already, resulting in the state I see for Turn 4.\n\nIf my previous move was LEFT, the sequence was:\n1. State at start of Turn 3: My Head (2, 6), Body [(2, 5), (2, 4)]. Enemy Head (6, 6).\n2. I chose LEFT. Enemy #0 chose a move X.\n3. State at start of Turn 4 (what I have as input): My Head (1, 6), Body [(2, 6)]. Enemy Head (7, 6).\n\nIf Snake #0 moved from (6, 6) to (7, 6), it moved RIGHT.\n\n**My Goal:** Closest Apple is (0, 8) (Manh. Dist 3: Left, Up, Up). (5, 6) (Manh. Dist 4: Right 4 times).\nLet's re-evaluate targets based on my current position (1, 6):\n1. (0, 8): Dist $|0-1| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (LEFT, UP, UP)\n2. (5, 6): Dist $|5-1| + |6-6| = 4$. (RIGHT x 4)\n3. (6, 4): Dist $|6-1| + |4-6| = 5 + 2 = 7$.\n\n(0, 8) remains the closest target. 3 steps away.\n\n**Safety Check (From (1, 6)):**\n*   **Body Segments to avoid:** (2, 6).\n*   **UP (1, 7):** Safe. New body: (1, 7), (1, 6). Tail (2, 6) drops.\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe. New body: (1, 5), (1, 6). Tail (2, 6) drops.\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe. New body: (0, 6), (1, 6). Tail (2, 6) drops. Moves towards (0, 8).\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** **Unsafe**. Hits body segment (2, 6).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (Snake #0 at (7, 6)):**\nWe need to predict Snake #0's next move. It is currently adjacent to apple (8, 6). It is also adjacent to apple (7, 4) diagonally.\nIf Snake #0 moves towards (8, 6) (RIGHT): New head at (8, 6).\nIf Snake #0 moves towards (7, 4) (DOWN): New head at (7, 5).\n\nMy safe moves are:\n1. LEFT (0, 6): Moves towards (0, 8).\n   - If Enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 6) (eats apple): Safe.\n   - If Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 5): Safe.\n   - Collision unlikely with any short move.\n2. UP (1, 7): Moves toward the center top area.\n3. DOWN (1, 5): Moves toward the center bottom area.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\nThe closest target is (0, 8). Moving LEFT to (0, 6) puts me 2 steps away from the apple. This is a strong pursuit.\nMoving UP to (1, 7) or DOWN to (1, 5) are neutral moves, maintaining distance from the target apple.\n\nSince (0, 8) is relatively close (distance 3) and there are no immediate threats, prioritizing movement towards this target using the safe move LEFT seems best.\n\nLong-term plan: Focus on collecting (0, 8) in the next two turns (LEFT, UP, UP). Then reassess the central cluster of apples (5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4).\n\nShort-term Plan: Move LEFT to (0, 6) to continue the pursuit of apple (0, 8). No predictable threats from Snake #0.\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 2 -> **3**. (The score update (Apples collected: 2 -> 3 implicitly) matches eating (0, 8) last turn). The snake length is 3 (Head + 2 body segments).\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5), Body: none, Apples: 0.\nThis implies Snake #0 just moved, but **it did not eat the apple at (7, 4)**, or the board representation hasn't updated Snake #0's position from the previous state where it was at (7, 5).\n\nLet's review the board representation vs the snakes list:\nBoard shows (7, 5) as '0'. Snake #0 is listed as Head (7, 5), Body: none.\nThe apples list shows (7, 4) is present.\n\nIf Snake #0 was at (7, 5) and its move resulted in the current state:\nOption A: Snake #0 moved DOWN to (7, 4) and ate the apple. Current state should show Head at (7, 4), Body [(7, 5)]. But the input *still* lists Head at (7, 5). This suggests Snake #0 did *not* eat the apple at (7, 4) and perhaps moved elsewhere, or the move prediction was completely wrong for the opponent.\n\n**Assuming the provided snake lists and board visualization based on my successful UP move are the canonical starting point for Turn 7:**\nMy Head: (0, 8). My Body: [(0, 7), (0, 6)]. (Safe cells: (0, 9), (1, 8)).\nSnake #0 Head: (7, 5). Body: none. (This means Snake #0 might have moved backwards or stayed put if it had length 1 before, or it moved non-optimally).\n\n**Target Apples:** (5, 9), (8, 6), (5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4).\nClosest to me are (0, 9) (if UP is chosen) or apples in the lower right quadrant.\n\n**Move Analysis (From (0, 8)):**\n1. **UP (0, 9):** Safe. Moves towards the very top edge. Next turn possible move is LEFT/RIGHT or staying put if necessary to avoid edge wall on turn 9.\n2. **RIGHT (1, 8):** Safe. Moves away from the left wall towards the center.\n3. **DOWN (0, 7):** **Unsafe**. Hits body segment (0, 7).\n4. **LEFT (-1, 8):** Unsafe (Off board).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Position Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (7, 5). It is far from me. If it moves this turn, it will likely target (7, 4) or (6, 4) or move towards (8, 6).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7, 4) (Eating apple): New state H(7, 4), B[(7, 5)].\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (6, 5): New state H(6, 5), B[].\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (8, 5): New state H(8, 5), B[].\n\nMy priority should be maximizing apple collection while keeping safe. I have secured the corner apple (0, 8). Now I need to move towards the cluster.\n\nMoving UP to (0, 9) is safe, but takes me to the top edge. If I move UP again, I'm off the board unless I move sideways first.\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 8) puts me in a better central positioning for my next move (e.g., potentially right again, or down later).\n\nDistance to closest remaining apples:\n(5, 6) or (6, 4) seem like good targets if I move aggressively right/down.\nDistance to (5, 6) from (0, 8): $5 + 2 = 7$ moves minimum.\nDistance to (1, 8) from (0, 8) is 1 move.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 8), next turn I can go RIGHT again to (2, 8), continuing the journey towards the cluster. This seems more favorable for navigating towards the center than going to the edge (0, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move towards the center mass of apples (around x=5, y=6). (1, 8) is a good stepping stone. I must be mindful of Snake #0's potential growth and pathing.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 7 / 150\n\nMy head is at (0, 8). My body is [(0, 7), (0, 6)]. I just ate the apple at (0, 8) last turn. Score 3.\nSnake #0 remains at (7, 5).\n\nSafe moves analysis from (0, 8):\n1. UP to (0, 9): Safe. Hits edge next turn if not careful.\n2. RIGHT to (1, 8): Safe. Moves towards the central mass of remaining apples.\n3. DOWN to (0, 7): Unsafe (hits body).\n4. LEFT: Unsafe (off board).\n\nI favor RIGHT over UP because moving to (0, 9) puts me on the top edge immediately, restricting my movement options severely on the next turn to only moving sideways along $Y=9$ or moving down into my body/off board. Moving RIGHT allows for continued horizontal progress toward the dense apple area ((5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 6)).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is far away, so immediate collision risk is low. I prioritize positioning for the next set of apples.\n\nPlan: Move right towards the central area (X=5, 6). (1, 8) is the first step.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Head moved from (0, 8) to (1, 8). Since I did not eat, my length remains 3.\nOld State: H(0, 8), B[(0, 7), (0, 6)].\nNew State: H(1, 8). New B = [Old H] + [Old B Segment 1]. New Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. Tail (0, 6) is dropped.\nThe input provided confirms this structure: Head (1, 8), Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. Score remained 3. This is correct for a non-eating move.\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's move:**\nSnake #0 is at H(7, 5), Body: none. Apples: 0.\nThe board state provided *before* my move suggested Snake #0 was at (7, 5). If it followed a standard pathing logic towards the closest apple (7, 4) or (6, 4), it might have moved.\nIf Snake #0 moved DOWN to (7, 4) and ate the apple, its new state would be H(7, 4), B[(7, 5)]. Score 1.\nIf Snake #0 moved LEFT to (6, 5), its new state would be H(6, 5), B[]. Score 0.\n\nSince the game summary only gives the results *after* all moves are processed, and the provided snake lists reflect the state *after* Turn 7 moves (and my apple gain), I must rely on the provided list for Snake #0: **Head: (7, 6)**. No, wait, the provided list for Turn 8 is:\nSnake #0 - Head: (7, 6), Body: none, Apples: 0.\n\nHow did Snake #0 get from (7, 5) [State at T7 End] to (7, 6) [State at T8 Start]?\nIt must have moved **UP** from (7, 5) to (7, 6) and did **NOT** eat (7, 4). This means it is moving towards the middle of the board, possibly aiming for (8, 6) or (5, 6), or generally exploring.\n\n**Current State at Start of Turn 8:**\nMy Head H1: (1, 8). Body B1: [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. Safe moves: (2, 8), (1, 9). (1, 7) is safe.\nSnake #0 Head H0: (7, 6). Body B0: none.\n\n**Target Apples:** (5, 9), (8, 6), (6, 4), (5, 6), (7, 4).\n\n**Move Analysis from (1, 8):**\n1. **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe. Continues horizontal progress toward the center apples (5, 6), (6, 4).\n2. **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Moves towards (5, 9).\n3. **DOWN (1, 7):** Safe. Moves towards the lower apples (5, 6), (7, 4), (6, 4).\n4. **LEFT (0, 8):** Unsafe (Hits body segment (0, 8)).\n\nAll three directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) are safe regarding self-collision. Collision with Snake #0 is unlikely as it is at (7, 6) and I am at (1, 8).\n\n**Evaluating Directional Preference:**\nThe closest apples are (5, 6) and (6, 4) (distance 4 or 5). (8, 6) is also reachable relatively soon if I head SE. (5, 9) is further via the top edge.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (1, 7):**\nThis path leads directly towards the cluster (5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4).\nNext turn I could move to (2, 7). Reaching (5, 6) takes about 4 more moves (if pure horizontal movement afterward).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\nThis path leads towards (8, 6) or allows flanking movement towards the (5, 6) cluster from above.\n\nIf I move **UP to (1, 9):**\nThis is a detour to the top edge apple (5, 9) which is likely less efficient than going for the central cluster first.\n\nThe central cluster (5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4) seems the most valuable target mass right now. Moving down towards Y=7 seems like the most direct trajectory towards Y=4/Y=6 apples.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (1, 7):\nTurn 9 options from (1, 7): (2, 7) [Right], (1, 6) [Down, towards (5, 6)]. (0, 7) is body.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (2, 8):\nTurn 9 options from (2, 8): (3, 8) [Right], (2, 7) [Down]. (1, 8) is body.\n\nGoing RIGHT maintains X progress, but going DOWN immediately starts closing the Y gap towards the primary target area (Y=4/Y=6). Since I have low body constraints, I can afford to move diagonally towards the target area. Moving DOWN seems slightly more aggressive towards the food mass.\n\nLet's verify Snake #0's potential move from (7, 6). It might move towards (8, 6) (eating the apple) or (5, 6).\nIf it moves RIGHT to (8, 6) and eats: H0(8, 6), B0[(7, 6)]. Score 1.\nIf it moves DOWN to (7, 5): H0(7, 5), B0[(7, 6)]. Score 0. (Likely reversing direction).\n\nIf Snake #0 targets (8, 6) and eats, it grows. Collision probability in the short term (2-4 turns) is low since we are far apart, but we are both heading towards the central/right area.\n\nI opt for moving DOWN to begin closing the X distance quicker indirectly by starting the descent toward Y=4/Y=6 apples.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move towards the cluster of apples centered around (6, 5), prioritizing moves that reduce Manhattan distance to the nearest uneaten apple ((5, 6) or (6, 4)). From (1, 8), moving DOWN to (1, 7) begins this descent efficiently. Continue moving towards the center mass (X increases, Y decreases).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The provided board state in the 'last move info' section suggesting Snake #0 was at (7, 6) with 0 apples, but the summary states Snake #0 has 1 apple. I must assume the most recent summary state is correct for Turn 9 calculation.)\nLet's re-evaluate Snake #0 based on the summary that says Score Snake #0: 1.\nIf Snake #0 *ate* an apple last turn (T8), it must have moved to (7, 4) or (6, 4) or (8, 6) (if it was near one of those).\nIf Snake #0 moved from (7, 5) (where it was T7 based on T8 prediction context) to (7, 4) and ate, its state after T8 move would be H(7, 4), B[(7, 5)]. Score 1.\nHowever, the provided state for T9 start is: Snake #0 - Head: (7, 6), Body: [], Apples: 1.\n\nThis implies Snake #0 moved from some location (X,Y) in T8 to (7, 6), and *already* has 1 apple.\nAssuming (7, 6) is the head, and Body is empty, it must have moved from (7, 5) (or (6, 6), (8, 6), (7, 7)) and *not* eaten in T8 OR it ate in T7 and then moved somewhere else in T8 without eating.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I rely solely on the *current known state for Turn 9*:\nMy Head H1: (1, 8). Moves made last turn: DOWN -> (1, 7).\nSnake #0 Head H0: (7, 6). Body B0: [].\n\n**Crucial Correction:** I must use the state provided *at the beginning of Turn 9*, not the state I deduced for the last move.\nMy state at the start of Turn 9 (after moving DOWN on T8):\nHead: (1, 7)\nBody: [(1, 8), (0, 8)] (Head moved from (1, 8) to (1, 7), old head (1, 8) becomes body, tail (0, 7) dropped)\n*Wait, my last move summary said I moved DOWN and my resulting head was (1, 8), body [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. This means the input I analyzed belonged to the END of Turn 8, and the state I need to use is the one provided for the START of Turn 9.*\n\n**State at Start of Turn 9:**\nMy Snake (ID 1): Head (1, 8), Body [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. (This is the result of moving RIGHT last turn, not DOWN as chosen in my rationale, but as recorded in the input block structure).\nSnake #0: Head (7, 6), Body [].\n\nSince the provided input is the state *before* my move on Turn 9, I must assess safety relative to my current head (1, 8) and Snake #0's head (7, 6).\n\n**My Positional Analysis (Starting from H(1, 8), B[(0, 8), (0, 7)]):**\n1. **UP (1, 9):** Safe. (2, 8) is available. New H(1, 9), B[(1, 8), (0, 8)]. Tail (0, 7) dropped.\n2. **DOWN (1, 7):** Safe. New H(1, 7), B[(1, 8), (0, 8)]. Tail (0, 7) dropped.\n3. **LEFT (0, 8):** Collision! Head (0, 8) is in Body [(0, 8), (0, 7)]. Actually, H hits B[0] = (0, 8). I die if I move LEFT. (My body is [(0, 8), (0, 7)]... Wait, my head is (1, 8), body segments are (0, 8) and (0, 7). Moving LEFT means moving to (0, 8). This IS a collision with the second segment of my body, which is unsafe according to standard rules (hitting any segment other than the tail, which is removed if I don't eat). Since (0, 8) is the *first* body segment, this is immediately fatal if moving into it.)\n4. **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe. New H(2, 8), B[(1, 8), (0, 8)]. Tail (0, 7) dropped.\n\nMoves UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), RIGHT (2, 8) are safe regarding self-collision.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (Snake #0 at (7, 6)):**\nSince the distance is large (Euclidean distance Sq: $(7-1)^2 + (6-8)^2 = 36 + 4 = 40$), immediate head-on collision (moving to (7, 6)) or body collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**Apple Target Evaluation (Apples: (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (7, 8)):**\nMy current location (1, 8) is far from all apples. Target cluster remains centered around (6, 5).\n\n*   **Option 1: Moving UP to (1, 9).** Takes me further away from the central cluster and towards the corner apple (5, 9). Distance to (5, 9) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} \\approx 4.1$. Distance to (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = 5$.\n*   **Option 2: Moving DOWN to (1, 7).** Starts moving towards the main cluster. Distance to (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} \\approx 4.1$. Distance to (6, 4) is $\\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} \\approx 5.8$.\n*   **Option 3: Moving RIGHT to (2, 8).** Closes the X distance gap to all apples simultaneously. Distance to (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} \\approx 3.6$. Distance to (6, 4) is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} \\approx 5.6$.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems marginally the best to immediately reduce distance to $(5, 6)$ and $(7, 8)$.\n\n**Predicting Snake #0's move from (7, 6):**\nSnake #0 has 1 apple. Closest edible apples for it: (7, 8) (dist 2), (8, 6) (dist 2, if it was an apple, but (8, 6) is not listed as an apple; the list is (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (7, 8)). The closest apple to (7, 6) is (7, 8) (UP) or (5, 6) (diagonally).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (7, 7), it is slightly closer to (7, 8).\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (6, 6), it heads toward (5, 6).\n\nI should try to secure (5, 6) or (7, 8) before Snake #0 does. Moving RIGHT (to (2, 8)) sets me up for a strong diagonal path towards (5, 6) or (7, 8) in subsequent turns.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8):\nT10 options: (3, 8) [R], (2, 7) [D], (2, 9) [U].\nThis keeps good options open. I choose RIGHT to start closing the X gap.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue prioritizing movement towards the central cluster of apples (5, 6), (6, 4), (7, 4) via Right/Down movements, while maintaining safety. Snake #0 is positioned on the right side, and moving right helps me reach that space slightly quicker, using the top edge only if necessary.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Dist to (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} \\approx 3.16$.\n\nComparing (3, 8) vs (2, 7):\n(3, 8) leads to (4, 8) next turn, still 4 away from (5, 6).\n(2, 7) leads possibly to (3, 7) or (2, 6) next turn, closing in on (5, 6). Dist to (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} \\approx 3.6$ from (2, 8). If we move DOWN to (2, 7), the distance becomes $\\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} \\approx 3.16$. This is a better reduction towards the primary target (5, 6) than moving RIGHT (which keeps distance at $\\sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} \\approx 4.47$ to (5, 6) from (3, 8)).\n\nIf S0 targets (7, 8) by moving UP to (7, 7), this is far away from us.\nIf S0 targets (5, 6) by moving LEFT to (6, 6), S0 will reach it faster than us.\n\nSince (5, 6) seems like a key target, moving DOWN to (2, 7) positions us better to attack it diagonally next turn (e.g., R to (3, 7) or D to (2, 6)).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Prioritize moving diagonally towards the central apple source (5, 6) by blending Right and Down movements, tracking Snake #0's aggression towards (7, 8) and (5, 6).\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

This means the move made in T10 resulted in H1 moving from (2, 7) to (2, 6).

DOWN (to (2, 5)): Moves us closer to the lower cluster (A(7, 4), A(6, 4)). Distance to A(5, 6) remains large (3 horizontal, 1 vertical).\n2. LEFT (to (1, 6)): Moves us further away from the main apple cluster.\n3. RIGHT (to (3, 6)): Moves us towards the main apple cluster (5, 6). Distance to A(5, 6) reduces from 3 to 2 horizontally.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 6), we are positioning well to reach (5, 6) on Turn 12 or 13, depending on S0's path.\nIf S0 moves to (5, 6), it eats the apple. We lose immediate access to it.\n\nLet's reassess the target priority. We are at the left edge of the board. We need to move right. A(5, 6) is the most central and currently reachable apple by movement flow.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 6):\nH1=(3, 6), B1=[(2, 6), (2, 7)]. S0 likely moves to (5, 6).\nNext turn: H1 can move RIGHT again to (4, 6), putting heavy pressure on (5, 6) if S0 moves away, or setting up for A(6, 4).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2, 5):\nH1=(2, 5), B1=[(2, 6), (2, 7)]. S0 eats A(5, 6). We are now pushing towards A(6, 4) and A(7, 4).\n\nGiven the board layout, advancing right seems necessary to engage the apples located on the right half of the board (X=5 to X=7). Moving DOWN traps us further in the bottom left quadrant, forcing a long path around later.\n\nLet's prioritize horizontal progress towards the cluster.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nLong-Term Plan for T12+: Continue advancing Right along the Y=6 line if possible, aiming for X=5, 6, 7 intersection points around Y=4/6. If the apples are taken, re-evaluate based on head positions, prioritizing safety above all else. Assume S0 will continue to eat apples aggressively.\n\nRIGHT",

The most likely move for S0 is LEFT to (5, 6) to eat this apple.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 6), H0_new = (5, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves based on S0 moving to (5, 6):**\nWe must ensure we don't collide with H0_new=(5, 6) or any of S0's new body segments.\nNew S0 Body: [(6, 6), (7, 6)].\n\n1. **DOWN to (2, 5):** Far from (5, 6). Safe. Moves us toward the lower apples (6, 4), (7, 4).\n2. **LEFT to (1, 6):** Far from (5, 6). Safe. Moves us away from apples.\n3. **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Far from (5, 6). Safe. Moves us towards (5, 6), covering distance (3->5).\n\n**Strategy:** We are currently on the left edge. The bulk of the available apples are heavily weighted towards the right side (X=5, 6, 7). Advancing right is key to engaging these targets, especially A(5, 6), A(6, 4), and A(7, 4).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 6), we are now 2 steps away from the apple S0 is likely taking (5, 6). This is the most direct path towards central action.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2, 5), S0 eats (5, 6). We are now pushing towards (6, 4) and (7, 4). The path length to (6, 4) from (2, 5) is $4 + 1 = 5$ moves, versus 4 moves from (3, 6) to (6, 4) assuming S0 doesn't block.\n\nBecause RIGHT moves us directly towards the immediate cluster of known apples, it is preferred over staying low (DOWN) or moving further left (LEFT).\n\nThe next turn (T12) if we move RIGHT to (3, 6) and S0 takes (5, 6), we can try RIGHT again to (4, 6), maintaining pressure on the right side and preparing for (6, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving right to engage the apples in the X=5 to X=7 range. Prioritize safety, but push horizontally over dwelling at the bottom edge. Watch the path of S0 carefully, especially as it consumes the apples on row Y=6.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples: 2.\nEnemy snake #0 (S0): Head: (7, 7), Body: [(7, 6)]. Apples: 1.\nApples: A1=(7, 4), A2=(6, 4), A3=(5, 6), A4=(5, 9), A5=(7, 8).\n\nWait, the input shows my body as [(3, 6), (2, 6)] and my head at (4, 6). This contradicts the \"last move rationale\" which stated my head was at (2, 6) in Turn 11, and then chose RIGHT to (3, 6) for Turn 12.\n\nThe provided input for Turn 12 is:\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (4, 6)\n  - Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 2\n\nThis means my move in Turn 11 was **RIGHT** from (3, 6) to (4, 6), assuming my last body position was (3, 6) and the tail dropped was (2, 6) if I didn't eat an apple.\n\nLet's reconcile the T11 rationale with the T12 board state:\nIf my T11 move was RIGHT, and my head at T11 started at (3, 6) (as concluded in the rationale: \"If we move RIGHT to (3, 6)...\"), then my T12 head is at (4, 6).\nIf I did not eat an apple, my body should be [(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)].\nThe provided state is Head: (4, 6), Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6)]. This confirms:\n1. I moved Right from (3, 6) to (4, 6).\n2. I did **NOT** eat an apple on T11 (otherwise the body would be longer).\n3. The tail segment that existed at (2, 6) in T11 must have been dropped (if my T11 body was [(3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)] before the move, or if the list provided is head-to-tail *after* the move but *before* the tail drop, which is non-standard, or if the list simply reflects the current state where the tail has just popped).\n\nGiven the standard state description (Head is first, then body segments, ordered head-to-tail):\nCurrent State (T12): H=(4, 6), B=[(3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length = 3.\nIf I didn't eat, my length remains 3. The tail should be at (2, 6). My previous position before moving to (4, 6) must have been (3, 6). My previous body must have ended with (2, 6). If the move didn't involve growth, the new tail is the old head's previous position, and the old tail position drops off.\n\nLet's assume the T11 rationalization was correct regarding the move choice (was RIGHT), and the current state provided reflects the outcome of T11. We now calculate moves for T12, starting from H=(4, 6).\n\n**Strategy for Turn 12:**\nCurrent Head H1 = (4, 6). Current Body B1 = [(3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 3.\n\n**Possible Moves for H1 (4, 6):**\n1. **UP (4, 7):** Safe. Body grows by segment at (4, 6), tail drops (2, 6).\n2. **DOWN (4, 5):** Safe. Body grows by segment at (4, 6), tail drops (2, 6).\n3. **LEFT (3, 6):** Collision with B1[0] = (3, 6). **Fatal.**\n4. **RIGHT (5, 6):** Collision with Apple A3=(5, 6). **Eat Apple!** Body grows by 2 segments, tail drops (2, 6). New length 4.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (Eating). LEFT is fatal.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S0 moves from H0=(7, 7)):**\nS0 Body: [(7, 6)]. Score 1.\nPotential targets for S0: A5=(7, 8). A1=(7, 4).\nS0 moving UP to (7, 8) seems highly probable as it is adjacent to an apple.\n\nIf S0 UP to (7, 8):\nNew H0 = (7, 8). New Body B0 = [(7, 7)]. (Tail segment (7, 6) drops).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves based on S0 moving to (7, 8):**\n\n1. **UP to (4, 7):** Safe from S0's new head at (7, 8). We are staying mid-board and progressing upwards.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe from S0. Moving towards A1=(7, 4) and A2=(6, 4).\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 6) [EAT A3=(5, 6)]:**\n   New H1 = (5, 6). New B1 = [(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 4.\n   This move immediately increases the score to 3 and extends our length, securing the apple S0 was also aiming for on row Y=6 based on my previous T11 analysis (though S0 is now moving to Y=8). This is a huge advantage. S0's new head (7, 8) is far away.\n\n**Comparison:**\nEating the apple at (5, 6) by moving RIGHT is clearly the most valuable move. It increases score immediately and extends the tail, improving survivability and board control. The other moves (UP, DOWN) are utility moves that gain distance but cede the immediate reward.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to eat (5, 6).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Post T12):**\nIf we eat (5, 6), H1=(5, 6), B1=[(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. The next valuable apples are (7, 4) and (6, 4). We are now 2 steps away from (7, 4) diagonally, or 1 step away from (6, 4) if we could move diagonally.\nIf S0 continued UP to (7, 8), it might then come down towards (7, 4).\n\nOur next likely move after eating at (5, 6) will be targeting (6, 4) or going UP to clear space above us. Given the cluster at Y=4, pushing towards X=6, X=7 seems beneficial.\n\nPlan: Secure the apple at (5, 6) now. On the next turn, prioritize moving towards (6, 4) or (7, 4), likely via the RIGHT or DOWN directions, depending on S0's simultaneous move.\n\nRIGHT is the move.\nRIGHT",

(A3 at (5, 6) was eaten).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 (S0): Head H0 = (6, 7), Body B0 = [(7, 7)]. Length 2. Score 1.\n\n**Step 1: Predict Enemy Moves (S0)**\nS0 is at (6, 7). Reachable apples: A5=(7, 8). Another nearby apple is A1=(7, 4).\nS0's most likely immediate move is UP to (6, 8) to approach A5=(7, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 7) which is occupied by its own body segment.\nLet's check S0 moves:\n1. UP to (6, 8): Safe. Approaches A5=(7, 8).\n2. DOWN to (6, 6): Safe. Moves towards the center.\n3. LEFT to (5, 7): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (7, 7): Collision with B0[0]=(7, 7). **Fatal.** (Wait, S0 body is [(7, 7)] and head is at (6, 7). If S0 moves right to (7, 7), it collides with its own previous adjacent segment (7, 7)).\n*Correction on S0 Body*: The input states: `* Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7)], Apples: 1`.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 7), it moves into the cell occupied by its own body segment (7, 7). This is fatal unless that segment is its immediately preceding tail, which it is here. If moving *into* another part of your body (not the immediate tail position if you aren't growing), it dies. Since S0 must have not eaten last round (length 2), moving to (7, 7) is suicide.\n\nLet's re-examine the state generation from T11 to T12 for S0.\nT11 S0 Head: (7, 7), Body: []. Implicitly S0 had length 1, or its tail just dropped. Score 1.\nIf S0 moved from (7, 7) last turn, say LEFT to (6, 7) to reach the current position, and it didn't eat. Its body should be the previous head position. If the body is specified as [(7, 7)], it implies the head moved from (7, 7) to (6, 7), and the segment (7, 7) remained static as the only body piece. This structure implies S0 has length 2.\n\nIf S0 did NOT eat in T11, and started T11 at H=(7, 7), B=[]. Move must have been to (6, 7). New state H=(6, 7), B=[(7, 7)]. This matches the current state description.\n\nIf S0 moves in T12 without eating:\n*   RIGHT to (7, 7): Collision with B0[0]. **Fatal Self-Collision.**\n\nTherefore, S0 is restricted to UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nLikely choices for S0:\nA) UP to (6, 8) - Approaching A5=(7, 8).\nB) LEFT to (5, 7) - Towards the center.\nC) DOWN to (6, 6) - Towards A1/A2 cluster.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate My Moves (H1=(5, 6))**\nMy body is [(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Backwards move is LEFT to (4, 6) -> Collision. **Fatal.**\nMy safe moves are UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), RIGHT (6, 6).\n\n**A) Move UP to (5, 7):**\nNew H1=(5, 7). New B1=[(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail drops (2, 6). Length 4.\n*Check Collisions with S0:*\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 8): (5, 7) is safe.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 7): **HEAD ON COLLISION** at (5, 7)! Both die. Score tie-breaker (3 vs 1) means I win if this happens. BUT, an intentional head-on collision to win is usually avoided if a safer path exists.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6): (5, 7) is safe.\n\n**B) Move DOWN to (5, 5):**\nNew H1=(5, 5). New B1=[(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail drops (2, 6). Length 4.\n*Check Collisions with S0:*\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 8): (5, 5) is safe.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 7): (5, 5) is safe.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6): (5, 5) is safe.\nThis is the safest move regarding calculated prediction of S0 movement options (avoiding the potential collision at (5, 7)). It brings us closer to the cluster of apples A1=(7, 4), A2=(6, 4).\n\n**C) Move RIGHT to (6, 6):**\nNew H1=(6, 6). New B1=[(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail drops (2, 6). Length 4.\n*Check Collisions with S0:*\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 8): (6, 6) is safe.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 7): (6, 6) is safe.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6): **HEAD ON COLLISION** at (6, 6)! Both die. Score tie-breaker (3 vs 1) means I win if this happens.\n\n**Step 3: Tie-breaking and Strategy**\nWe have two moves that risk collision but result in an immediate win via score tiebreaker if the opponent makes the corresponding move: UP (collision at (5, 7)) and RIGHT (collision at (6, 6)).\n\nHowever, S0 is facing suicide (RIGHT) and is likely trying to move towards apples A5=(7, 8) (UP) or maintain position/move centrally (LEFT/DOWN).\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 8):\n  UP ((5, 7) safe) > RIGHT ((6, 6) safe). DOWN ((5, 5) safe).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 7):\n  UP ((5, 7) collision, I win). DOWN ((5, 5) safe) > RIGHT ((6, 6) safe).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6):\n  UP ((5, 7) safe) > DOWN ((5, 5) safe) > RIGHT ((6, 6) collision, I win).\n\nSince DOWN to (5, 5) is safe against *all* the rational moves S0 has available (UP, LEFT, DOWN), it is the least risky move that still makes progress towards the next set of apples (A1, A2). Moving UP risks a potential collision if S0 tries to sneak towards the middle (LEFT move), and moving RIGHT risks a collision if S0 attempts to move into the lower central area (DOWN move).\n\nStrategy Note: The immediate area Y=6 became somewhat constrained due to my previous path. Moving DOWN to Y=5 clears the path for the next turn, securing proximity to the cluster at Y=4 ((7, 4) and (6, 4)). Since one of S0's moves (RIGHT) is suicidal, increasing focus on safe movement towards the next targets is prudent over trying to engineer a score-tiebreak win, especially since winning by score tiebreaker requires the opponent to make a highly specific, non-obvious move (while their obvious move, UP, is safe for both relative to my DOWN move).\n\nMove DOWN to (5, 5). This keeps us safe regardless of S0's rational choices (UP, LEFT, DOWN).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Aim directly for apple A2=(6, 4) or A1=(7, 4). From (5, 5), moving DOWN again to (5, 4) positions us perfectly to move RIGHT towards the target apples on the next turn(s).\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN again to (5, 4) continues this direct approach, brings us one step closer to the apples, and seems safe against all predictable S0 moves.\n\nIf I move to (5, 4):\nNext turn (T15): H1=(5, 4). I can move RIGHT to (6, 4) to eat A2, or LEFT to (4, 4) / UP to (5, 5).\nIf S0 moves to (6, 6) or (5, 7), I can safely eat A2 next turn via RIGHT.\n\nLet's check if S0 can cut me off at (6, 4) or (7, 4).\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 8): S0 is still far from the Y=4 apples. I can reach (6, 4) next turn.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6): S0 is closer, but I can still reach (6, 4) next turn by moving RIGHT from (5, 4) to (6, 4). If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 6) next turn, I still get the apple. If S0 moves to (7, 6) from (6, 6) and I move to (6, 4), we are relatively safe. If S0 moves to (5, 6) from (6, 6), we are safe.\n\nThe move DOWN appears the most direct path towards our visible targets (A1, A2) and avoids any calculated collision risks based on S0's remaining viable moves.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Focus on securing apples A2=(6, 4) and A1=(7, 4). Move towards Y=4. If I secure both, my score increases to 5, significantly widening the gap. If S0 aggressively pursues A5=(7, 8), that is fine as it moves it away from my target zone.\n\nDOWN",

The old body segment (5, 6) moves to (5, 7) if the length increases (eating an apple) or drops off to keep the length the same. Since I don't eat an apple, the tail (3, 6) drops off, and the body list shifts: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. Wait, the *entire* body shifts.\nIf H1 moves to $P$, New Body = $[P] + (\\text{Old Body excluding Tail})$.\nOld Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. Tail is (3, 6).

Yes, I collide with my *new* body segment (5, 6) immediately, unless the tail drops off *before* the collision check, which is how snake works. The cell I move into, (5, 6), is currently occupied by my body segment at index 0. When I move UP one cell, the tail (3, 6) is removed, and my body becomes [(5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 6)]. Since (5, 6) is the *new* head position, I must check if it lands on the rest of the body: [(5, 5), (4, 6)]. This is safe. (5, 6) is clear, as (5, 6) was my previous head, which is now segment B[0]. When the move executes, the entire body shifts forward one slot, and the tail segment drops off. The cell I land on must not be in the set {Old Head's next segment} U {Old Body Segments except Tail}.\n    *   If I move UP to (5, 6): Old body segments excluding tail (assuming no apple): \\{(5, 6), (4, 6)\\}.\n    *   (5, 6) is occupied by the segment that *will* become the second segment in the new body list. This constitutes hitting self in most implementations if the segment at (5, 6) is not the tail dropping off.\n    *   Let's use the strict definition: The new head $P$ must not be in $\\{\\text{Board limits}\\} \\cup \\{\\text{New Body}\\}$. If length is fixed L, New Body = list of L-1 cells starting from Old Head's neighbor.\n    *   Old Body (excluding tail): \\{(5, 6), (4, 6)\\}. If I move to (5, 6), I re-enter the space previously occupied by my head, which is now the first body segment. **This move (UP to (5, 6)) is a self-collision and results in death.**\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** (The previous move choice based on last turn's rationale)\n    *   Future Body (if no apple): [(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. Tail (3, 6) drops.\n    *   Collision check against self: (5, 4) is not in $\\{(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)\\}$. Safe from self.\n    *   Collision check against S0 moves $M_0$:\n        *   S0 to (7, 5): Safe.\n        *   S0 to (6, 6): Safe.\n        *   S0 to (8, 6): Safe.\n    *   Apple check: Moving to (5, 4) misses the apples A1(7, 4) and A2(6, 4). It places me adjacent to them vertically.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Future Body (if no apple): [(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)].

Tail (3, 6) drops.\n    *   Collision check against self: (6, 5) is not in $\\{(5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)\\}$. Safe from self.\n    *   Collision check against S0 moves $M_0$:\n        *   S0 to (6, 6): Collision! (6, 5) hits S0's potential new head position (6, 6)? No, they are adjacent. Safe.\n        *   Wait, S0 moves to (6, 6). My move is RIGHT to (6, 5). This is safe from S0 head-on.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Selection based on (5, 5)**\n\nThe previous move was DOWN to (5, 5). My goal is to reach A2(6, 4) or A1(7, 4).\n\n*   Move DOWN to (5, 4) (Chosen last turn): This is safe and moves me closer to Y=4. Next turn, I can strongly aim for (6, 4) or make a lateral move.\n*   Move RIGHT to (6, 5): This moves me immediately adjacent to A2's Y-coordinate, setting up a strong push towards the apples next turn, potentially eating A2(6, 4) or A1(7, 4) on T16.\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (6, 5):\n        *   If S0 moves to (6, 6), they are close but safe. On T16, I can move DOWN to (6, 4) and eat A2!\n        *   If S0 moves away, I definitely eat A2.\n        *   If S0 moves to (7, 5), they are far away. I eat A2.\n\nComparing (5, 4) [DOWN] vs (6, 5) [RIGHT]:\n(5, 4) requires two moves (RIGHT then DOWN/UP) to reach (6, 4).\n(6, 5) requires one move (DOWN) to reach (6, 4).\n\nSince all options (4, 5, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe regarding self-collision and S0's predicted move set, I prioritize the move that maximizes immediate apple proximity. (6, 5) is superior to (5, 4) as it positions me one cell closer to *both* target apples in the horizontal direction, while keeping the vertical alignment needed for the next step.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT to (6, 5) on T15:\nOn T16, my head H1=(6, 5). I check DOWN to (6, 4).\nBody: [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. (3, 6) drops.\nCheck collision for (6, 4) against $M_0$ moves:\nS0 moves from $M_0 = \\{(7, 5), (6, 6), (8, 6)\\}$ follow H0'=(X', Y').\n1. If S0 is at (7, 5): Safe.\n2. If S0 is at (6, 6): Collision! (6, 4) is safe from (6, 6) as they are not the same spot. Safe.\n3. If S0 is at (8, 6): Safe.\n\nIt seems moving RIGHT to (6, 5) sets up a guaranteed capture of A2=(6, 4) on the next turn (T16), regardless of S0's reaction, because S0 cannot intercept (6, 4) or directly collide with my move to (6, 5) on T15. Eating A2 brings me to 4 apples. This is the best path forward.\n\nI must disregard the rationale from the previous turn (\"DOWN\") because that move has already been executed, and I am now evaluating the move for Turn 15 based on the *current* state after the move to (5, 5) was made. I am evaluating moves *from* (5, 5).\n\nMy intended move for Turn 15 is RIGHT.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Execute the direct path to A2(6, 4) via (6, 5). If A2 is eaten T16, the snake grows, and I will reassess pursuit of A1(7, 4) or A5(7, 8). Maintain safety margins against S0, who seems focused on the lower half of the board as well.\n\nRIGHT",

Scoring increases to 5 apples. The increased length slightly limits future movement options but secures points. S0 is currently preoccupied with A3=(7, 8) or maneuvering elsewhere. If S0 eats A3=(7, 8), they go from L=2 to L=3. If I eat A1=(7, 4), I go from L=4 to L=5.\n\n**Option B: UP to (6, 5) [No Apple, set up]**\nThis move positions me centrally facing the remaining apples: A2(5, 9), A4(8, 5), A5(5, 7). From (6, 5), I can move UP/RIGHT/LEFT next turn depending on S0's move, aiming for (X, 5) or (6, X). E.g., if S0 moves away, I can aim for A4(8, 5) next turn by moving RIGHT to (7, 5), then RIGHT to (8, 5).\n\nComparing A and B: Eating A1 now seems superior. It builds immediate score and size advantage while still being safe from immediate danger. The proximity of A1 to my current head (6, 4) makes it the easiest next target to secure.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Capture A1=(7, 4) immediately. Then reposition to hunt A4=(8, 5) or A5=(5, 7). Maintain clearance from S0, especially if they head towards (7, 8) or (8, 7).\n\nMove: RIGHT\nRIGHT",

(Move (7, 8) -> (7, 7) is invalid if the tail doesn't move). If S0 eats an apple, the tail stays. If S0 does not eat, the cell (7, 6) is vacated. Since S0 just ate A3=(7, 8), its length increased, so tail (7, 6) is still part of the structure. Thus, moving to (7, 7) is hitting itself. Invalid.\n3. LEFT to (6, 8).\n4. RIGHT to (8, 8). **Collision with Apple A4!** (This counts as safe movement, but it eats A4). Length 4.\n\nS0 Safe Moves Set $M_0$: \\{(7, 9), (6, 8), (8, 8) [Eats A4]\\}.\n\nS0 is highly likely to eat A4=(8, 8) by moving RIGHT, increasing score to 4.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate My Safe Moves from H1 = (7, 4)**\nMy current body (excluding head) $B'_1 = \\{(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)\\}$. Tail to drop is (5, 6).\nMy potential next positions $P_1$: \\{(7, 5) UP, (7, 3) DOWN, (6, 4) LEFT, (8, 4) RIGHT\\}.\n\n1. **UP to (7, 5):** Safe from self collision as (7, 5) is not in $B'_1$.\n    *   Collision with S0 moves $M_0$: (7, 5) is safe from S0's predicted heads (7, 9), (6, 8), (8, 8).\n    *   Apple Check: Does not hit an apple. Positions me nicely between A5(5, 7) and A4(8, 8) vicinity (though S0 might grab A4).\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe from self collision.\n    *   Collision with S0 moves $M_0$: Safe.\n    *   Apple Check: Does not hit an apple. Moves me away from the remaining apples (A2, A5).\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4):** **Self Collision Warning!** (6, 4) is the next segment in $B'_1$. Invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe from self collision.\n    *   Collision with S0 moves $M_0$: Safe.\n    *   Apple Check: Does not hit an apple.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Selection**\nRemaining apples: A2=(5, 9), A5=(5, 7). S0 is likely heading for A4=(8, 8).\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8) (eats A4), they will have 4 apples and length 4, positioned near my current (7, 4) location, but horizontally distanced.\n\nMy priority should be capturing A5=(5, 7) or A2=(5, 9). A5 is closer.\n\nMove UP to (7, 5): This aligns me slightly towards the left side where A5 is located. From (7, 5), I can move LEFT to (6, 5) next turn, then potentially UP/LEFT toward (5, 7).\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 4): This moves me towards A4's *previous* location, which is now occupied by S0's head or tail if they move RIGHT. If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8), moving RIGHT to (8, 4) is safe but far from remaining apples.\n\nMove UP to (7, 5) seems strategically sound. It keeps me central, safe, and pivots me towards the remaining cluster of apples (A2, A5) centered around X=5.\n\n**Long Term Strategy Note:** Focus on A5=(5, 7). If S0 eats A4=(8, 8), they are now on the right side. (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) [unsafe] or (6, 5) -> (5, 5) [unsafe] or (6, 5) -> (5, 6) [unsafe].\nFrom (7, 5): Next move could be LEFT to (6, 5). From (6, 5), I can aim for (5, 5) or (5, 6) next if I need to traverse the body, or aim UP to (6, 6) -> (5, 6) [unsafe].\n\nLet's re-examine the path to A5=(5, 7) from H1=(7, 4):\nPath 1: (7, 4) -> R (8, 4) -> R/U/D... (too far right)\nPath 2: (7, 4) -> U (7, 5) -> L (6, 5) -> U (6, 6) -> L (5, 6) [unsafe body cell right now] or L (5, 5) [safe body cell right now].\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 5). My body shifts: New Body = \\{(7, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)\\}. Tail (4, 6) is dropped.\nNext turn, move LEFT to (6, 5). New Body = \\{(6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)\\}. Tail (5, 6) is dropped.\nNext turn, move UP to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 5) [Collision] or LEFT to (5, 6) [Safe].\nIf (6, 5) -> LEFT to (5, 6). New Body = \\{(5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)\\}. Tail (5, 5) dropped. I am now adjacent to A5=(5, 7) via (5, 6) -> UP to (5, 7). This looks like a 4-turn path to A5.\n\nGiven S0 is likely moving to (8, 8), I need to prioritize reaching the left side apples while maintaining safety. UP is the best pivot move.\n\nUP",
