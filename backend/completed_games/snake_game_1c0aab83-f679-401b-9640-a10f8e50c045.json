Hopefully, it won't get in my way. I'll focus on expanding my territory by heading towards the top right of the board. If I get a chance, I'd love to grab the apple at (1, 2), but mainly I just want to keep moving up and to the right.\n\nLet's see... since my snake is currently at (0, 5) and I've decided to move left, I'll aim to move left to... decided next move: LEFT.",

The apples are still far away, but moving in one direction is generally a good strategy to avoid getting boxed in.\n\nMy strategy will remain: continue moving RIGHT until a better opportunity arises (an apple appearing closer, the enemy moving into a position where I can intercept, or a dangerous situation developing).\n\nRIGHT",
