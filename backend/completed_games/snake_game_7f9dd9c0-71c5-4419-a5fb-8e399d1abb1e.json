My snake is at (6,5) with a body segment at (5,5), so adjacent cells are: up to (6,6), down to (6,4), left to (5,5) which is occupied by my body, and right to (7,5). Left is invalid because it's blocked by my own body.\n\nFrom the board state and apple positions, I can see that there are no apples adjacent to my head, so moving won't immediately give me points. The enemy snake at (5,4) has no body segments, so it might be a threat if we get too close, but currently, (5,4) is not adjacent, so no immediate danger. However, moving right to (7,5) might not be safe as the board shows 'T' and '0' there, which are not clearly defined in the rules, so I'll assume it's risky to go that way unless necessary.\n\nThe six apples are at: (2,2), (5,1), (9,6), (6,1), and (7,1). Distance-wise, the closest apple is (6,1) at Manhattan distance 4 (same x, y=1), followed by (5,1) and (7,1) at distance 5, and (9,6) at distance 4. Since (6,1) is directly below me, moving down could be a good strategy to start approaching that apple without turning or drawing enemy attention. Moving up to (6,6) might lead to the (9,6) apple later but doesn't have an apple nearby. Right is here, but I just came from that direction, and I don't know if (7,5) is safe or beneficial.\n\nMy last move was RIGHT, so repeating that might not be ideal if I want to explore a new direction. Also, since I need to gain points, I should prioritize moving towards an apple. Starting with DOWN to (6,4) allows me to move closer to (6,1) by continuing down if I want. Not moving riskily, as all other options seem safer or neutral for the next move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I survive this move, I'll continue moving down until I reach y=0 or find another apple, then adjust direction. I should keep an eye on the enemy, but since it's small and no direction given, it might not be a big threat yet. Also, avoid obstacles and stay away from walls.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN\n\nEnd of response.",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current situation based on the board state and available information. The snake head is at (6,4), and the body includes at least (6,5). This means (6,5) is occupied, so possible moves are left to (5,4), down to (6,3), or right to (7,4). Moving up to (6,5) is invalid because it's occupied.\n\nNow, let's analyze the board state and apple positions:\n\n- Apples are located at (2,2), (5,1), (9,6), (6,1), and (7,1).\n- From the current head position (6,4), the Manhattan distances to the apples are:\n  - (2,2): |6-2| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n  - (5,1): |6-5| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n  - (9,6): |6-9| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n  - (6,1): |6-6| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3 (closest, located directly below)\n  - (7,1): |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThe closest apple is (6,1) with a distance of 3. To minimize distance, we should prioritize moving downward, as decreasing the y-coordinate brings us closer to this apple.\n\nAfter eating an apple, the snake will grow, gaining 1 point, and we need to consider future moves. Once (6,1) is eaten, the snake will be at (6,1) or similar if moving from there. From (6,1), the distances to other apples are:\n- (5,1): |6-5| + |1-1| = 1, very close and directly adjacent or easy to reach.\n- (7,1): |6-7| + |1-1| = 1, same as above.\n- (2,2): |6-2| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5, farther.\n- (9,6): |6-9| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8, very far.\n\nThis suggests that after eating (6,1), we can efficiently move to (5,1) or (7,1), both at Manhattan distance 1. These apples are also closer to (6,1) compared to (2,2) or (9,6).\n\nEnemy snake at (3,4) has no body segments, so it poses no immediate threat. There are no other snakes present except this one. The cell (6,3) is free, as per the board state (row y=3, x=6 is '.'), so moving down to (6,3) is safe.\n\nPossible moves:\n- Down to (6,3): Decreases y-coordinate, directly towards (6,1), and stays vertically aligned, avoiding lateral movement that might not be optimal.\n- Left to (5,4): Not directly toward any apple except (5,1), but Manhattan distance from (5,4) to (5,1) is |5-5| + |4-1| = 3, while from (6,4) is 4, so moving left doesn't necessarily shorten the path to apples and could be inefficient.\n- Right to (7,4): Similar issue, while (7,4) is closer to (7,1) (Manhattan from (7,4) to (7,1) is |7-7| + |4-1| = 3), but still farther than moving directly downward.\n\nSince the last move was DOWN, and moving down is consistent with the strategy to reach the closest apple, I will again choose DOWN. This move also avoids any potential risk from the enemy, as it's not facing the enemy position.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,1), I will prioritize moving to (5,1) or (7,1) for immediate points and proximity. I should monitor the enemy snake's position if it moves or grows, and avoid walls or collisions. Focus on low y-coordinates for apples for optimization.\n\nThe cell (6,3) is within bounds (y=3 is between 0 and 9, x=6 between 0 and 9), and as per board state, it's empty, so no wall or self-collision issue.\n\n Decided next move: DOWN",

Possible moves from (6,4) are:\n\n- Up: to (6,5) \u2014 empty, but moving up increases y-coordinate, which is away from the closest apple (6,1) at distance 3.\n- Down: to (6,3) \u2014 occupied by body, invalid.\n- Left: to (5,4) \u2014 empty, same y-coordinate, decreasing x-coordinate.\n- Right: to (7,4) \u2014 empty, same y-coordinate, increasing x-coordinate.\n\nThe closest apple is (6,1) at Manhattan distance 3. To reduce this distance, we should prioritize decreasing the y-coordinate (moving down). However, direct down movement is blocked by (6,3). Therefore, we must first move to a different position where down movement is possible and leads closer to (6,1).\n\nMoving left or right (same y-coordinate) is neutral for reducing the y-distance but changes the x-coordinate. Moving to (5,4) or (7,4) both have a Manhattan distance of 4 to (6,1), which is worse than current 3. However, from (5,4), we can move down to (5,3) (assuming empty), then to (5,2), and eventually to (5,1) or (6,1) if accessible. Similarly for (7,4).\n\nThere are no enemy threats nearby, as Snake #1 is at (2,4) with no body, and other areas appear empty based on the board and apple positions. The cell (6,3) being blocked doesn't block other x-column down movements like (5,3) or (7,3).\n\nSince moving up to (6,5) increases the distance and is counterproductive for reaching (6,1), it should be avoided. Between left and right moves, both are viable, but (6,1) is at same x, so staying in x=6 is beneficial. However, since direct down is invalid, we need to position ourselves for a future down move. Moving left to (5,4) allows access to down movement at x=5, or moving right to (7,4) allows access (but (7,3) might be occupied if 'T' is an enemy). Since (7,3) is ambiguous from the board, to be safe and closer to (6,1) in x-coordinate, moving left to (5,4) is slightly better for potential future movement to (6,1) via (5,3) or elsewhere.\n\nManhattan distance to other apples:\n- (5,1): distance 4, but after moving to (5,4) or down, could be closer.\n- (7,1): distance 4, similar.\n- (2,2), (9,6) are farther.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After this move, if possible, continue to decrease y-coordinate towards (6,1) or other low-y apples. Avoid enemies and walls. The goal is to maximize points, so prioritize accessing (6,1) or (5,1)/(7,1) apples when available.\n\nDECIDED MOVE: LEFT",

Available moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, but moving RIGHT to (6,1) is a strong option because (6,1) contains an apple. Eating this apple would gain a point and grow the snake immediately.\n\nLet's evaluate the Manhattan distances to apples from my current position (5,1):\n\n- (2,2): |5-2| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (9,6): |5-9| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9\n- (6,1): |5-6| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (8,7): |5-8| + |1-7| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe apple at (6,1) is the closest (distance 1), so moving right to consume it is advantageous. I don't have the board state diagram fully clear, but based on the coordinate description, (6,1) should be empty except for the apple, so moving there is valid and won't be blocked.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) are also options, but both are away from any immediate fruit or points. (4,1) and (5,0) don't have apples, and moving there might not be as efficient for growth. The apple at (7,1) is nearby (distance 2), so by moving RIGHT, I gain the closer apple and set myself up to eat (7,1) in the next move if necessary.\n\nEnemy snake at (1,3) is not a threat, as it's far away and has no body segments. No other enemies are present, so I can focus on eating apples without worrying about collisions.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move RIGHT to consume the apple and continue growing the snake. For subsequent turns, I should try to extend towards the other apples while monitoring for enemies, but immediately, eating this apple is key.\n\nDECIDED MOVE: RIGHT",

No apple is at (4,0), so moving left does not gain points.\n\nThe nearest apple is (4,2), with a Manhattan distance of 2 (only two steps up from (4,0)). After moving to (4,0), I will prioritize moving up to reach (4,2), as it is closer than other apples and likely to provide points if reached.\n\nHowever, I must be cautious of the enemy snake #1 at (1,2), which has no body and could potentially move. Since it is on the left side, moving further left might bring it closer to my snake or create threats. But for now, it is not an immediate danger.\n\nIn the next turn, from (4,0), I will consider moving UP to (4,1) if it is safe, to progress toward (4,2). Other options like moving LEFT to (3,0) might be explored if vertical movement is blocked, but vertical progress is preferable to access the apples at y=2.
