Its possible moves this turn are UP (4,\u202f6), DOWN (4,\u202f4), LEFT (3,\u202f5), RIGHT (5,\u202f5). None of those squares is (7,\u202f1) or (8,\u202f0), so the opponent cannot block either of your safe moves on this turn.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **LEFT** brings you closer to the nearest apple (6,\u202f0) and keeps more options open for the next move.  \n- **DOWN** is safe but moves you away from the nearest apple and reduces future flexibility.\n\nTherefore the optimal move is **LEFT**.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. Turn\u202f2: Move **LEFT** to (7,\u202f1).  \n2. Turn\u202f3: From (7,\u202f1) you can either continue LEFT to (6,\u202f1) to approach the apple at (6,\u202f0), or move DOWN to (7,\u202f0) to stay on the bottom row. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s movement; if it moves left/up, you\u2019ll have a clearer path to (6,\u202f0).  \n3. Turn\u202f4+: If you reach (6,\u202f0), eat it and grow; otherwise, look for a path toward the central apple at (4,\u202f0) or the top apple at (4,\u202f8) while always maintaining at least two safe exit squares.\n\nLEFT",

None of those squares is (6,\u202f1), (7,\u202f0), or (7,\u202f2), so it cannot block any of your safe moves this turn.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **LEFT** brings you closer to the nearest apple (6,\u202f0) and keeps the most options open for subsequent moves.  \n- **DOWN** is safe but moves you to the board edge with fewer exits.  \n- **UP** moves you away from the nearest apple and limits future flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is **LEFT**.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. Turn\u202f3: Move **LEFT** to (6,\u202f1).  \n2. Turn\u202f4: From (6,\u202f1) you can continue LEFT to (5,\u202f1) to approach (4,\u202f0) or DOWN to (6,\u202f0) to eat the apple there. Watch the opponent\u2019s movement; if it moves right/up, you\u2019ll have a clearer path to (6,\u202f0).  \n3. Turn\u202f5+: After eating (6,\u202f0) or (4,\u202f0), consider moving toward the central apple at (5,\u202f4) or the top apple at (4,\u202f8) while keeping at least two safe exit squares.\n\nLEFT",

Its possible moves this turn are UP (6,\u202f8), DOWN (6,\u202f6), LEFT (5,\u202f7), RIGHT (7,\u202f7). None of those squares is (4,\u202f0) or (5,\u202f1), so the enemy cannot block either of your safe moves this turn.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **LEFT** is the only move that **collects an apple immediately** and improves your score.  \n- **UP** is safe but delays the apple capture and offers no advantage.\n\nThe optimal choice is **LEFT** to (4,\u202f0), eat the apple, grow to length\u202f5, and score\u202f4.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. Turn\u202f6: Move **LEFT** to (4,\u202f0) \u2192 eat the apple \u2192 grow to length\u202f5, score\u202f4.  \n2. Turn\u202f7: From (4,\u202f0) you can head **LEFT** to (3,\u202f0) or **UP** to (4,\u202f1). The next nearest apple is (2,\u202f2) (distance\u202f3) or (5,\u202f4) (distance\u202f5). Choose a direction that keeps multiple exits open and moves you toward the nearest reachable apple while monitoring the enemy\u2019s moves.\n\nLEFT",

From (2,\u202f1) you will have **LEFT** and **UP** as exits (RIGHT is your body, DOWN is your tail).\n   - **LEFT** to (1,\u202f0) \u2192 heads toward apple (1,\u202f1) (one more UP reaches it). From (1,\u202f0) you will have **LEFT**, **UP**, and **RIGHT** (your tail) as exits.\n\n3. **Enemy considerations**\n   - Enemy at (5,\u202f7) can move to (6,\u202f7), (4,\u202f7), (5,\u202f8), or (5,\u202f6). None of those squares is (2,\u202f1) or (1,\u202f0), so it cannot block either of your safe moves this turn.\n\n4. **Board space and flexibility**\n   - After **UP** to (2,\u202f1), your next move can be **UP** to (2,\u202f2) (apple) or **LEFT** to (1,\u202f1) (apple). This gives you immediate access to two apples.\n   - After **LEFT** to (1,\u202f0), your next move can be **UP** to (1,\u202f1) (apple) or **LEFT** to (0,\u202f0) (open). This also gives you immediate access to an apple.\n\nBoth moves are equally safe and give you a chance to eat an apple next turn. However, **UP** aligns you directly with apple (2,\u202f2) without changing columns, which often provides more exit options later (you keep the same x\u2011coordinate). Moving **LEFT** to (1,\u202f0) shifts you to column\u202fx\u202f=\u202f1, which may be slightly more restrictive if the enemy later moves to block that column.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **UP** to (2,\u202f1) is the optimal choice because it lines you up for apple (2,\u202f2) while preserving column flexibility.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n1. Turn\u202f9: Move **UP** to (2,\u202f1).  \n2. Turn\u202f10: From (2,\u202f1) move **UP** to (2,\u202f2) to eat the apple (gain 1 point, length\u202f6). After eating, you will be able to continue toward (1,\u202f1) or (5,\u202f4) depending on the enemy\u2019s position.\n\nUP",

Evaluating the safe moves\n\n#### 3.1 Move **UP** to (0,\u202f2)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (0,\u202f2):\n  - LEFT (\u22121,\u202f2) \u2192 off\u2011board (blocked)\n  - RIGHT (1,\u202f2) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n  - UP (0,\u202f3) \u2192 empty\n- **Result:** only one safe exit (UP) next turn. You will be forced to continue moving up the left edge, which gives you a clear path toward the apple at (1,\u202f6) and later toward the cluster at (6,\u202f7)/(7,\u202f7). It also keeps you away from the enemy\u2019s current column (4\u20135) and from the bottom\u2011edge corner.\n\n#### 3.2 Move **DOWN** to (0,\u202f0)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (0,\u202f0):\n  - DOWN (0,\u202f\u22121) \u2192 off\u2011board (blocked)\n  - RIGHT (1,\u202f0) \u2192 empty\n- **Result:** only one safe exit (RIGHT) next turn, meaning you\u2019ll be forced to move back into the middle of the board. This puts you closer to the lower\u2011right cluster of apples (5,\u202f4) and (7,\u202f1) but leaves you with fewer options and a tighter space.\n\n### 4.  Enemy considerations\nThe enemy is at (4,\u202f7). Its possible moves this turn are (3,\u202f7), (5,\u202f7), (4,\u202f8), or (4,\u202f6). None of those threaten your current position or either of the two safe moves you have. There is no immediate head\u2011on collision risk.\n\n### 5.  Space & flexibility\n- **UP** gives you a single exit next turn but keeps you on the left edge, away from the enemy and giving a clear upward path toward the apple at (1,\u202f6). It also avoids the bottom\u2011edge corner.\n- **DOWN** forces you into the bottom\u2011left corner with only one exit, which is generally riskier and limits future options.\n\n### 6.  Short\u2011term plan\n1. **Move UP to (0,\u202f2).**  \n   - This avoids the bottom\u2011edge corner and keeps you on the left edge.  \n   - Next turn you\u2019ll be at (0,\u202f2) with one safe exit (UP) toward (0,\u202f3). You can continue moving up the left edge, aiming for the apple at (1,\u202f6) or positioning yourself to contest the cluster at (6,\u202f7)/(7,\u202f7) later.  \n2. **Monitor the enemy** \u2013 if it moves away from column\u202f4 (e.g., toward (5,\u202f7) or (4,\u202f6)), you may have a chance to swing right later and claim the apple at (5,\u202f4) or (7,\u202f1).  \n3. **Stay aware of your tail** \u2013 after moving up a few squares you\u2019ll need to keep the tail in a position that doesn\u2019t block your path.\n\nUP",

Rationale for moving UP\n\n- **Apple?** No apple at (0,\u202f3).\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (0,\u202f3):\n  - LEFT (\u22121,\u202f3) \u2192 off\u2011board (blocked)\n  - RIGHT (1,\u202f3) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (0,\u202f2) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n- **Result:** you\u2019ll have two safe exits next turn (RIGHT and UP).

You can continue moving up the left edge toward the apple at (1,\u202f6) and later contest the cluster at (6,\u202f7)/(7,\u202f7). The move also avoids any immediate head\u2011on collision with the enemy.\n\n### 4. Enemy considerations\n\nThe enemy is at (5,\u202f7).

Evaluating each safe move\n\n#### Move **UP** to (1,\u202f4)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (1,\u202f4):\n  - LEFT (0,\u202f4) \u2192 empty\n  - RIGHT (2,\u202f4) \u2192 empty\n  - UP (1,\u202f5) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (1,\u202f3) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n- **Result:** three safe exits next turn. You stay clear of the left edge.\n- **Path to apples:** The apple at (1,\u202f6) is two rows up; you can reach it in two moves (UP, UP) then RIGHT to (2,\u202f6) and UP to (1,\u202f6). The apple at (5,\u202f4) is reachable by moving right/up later.\n\n#### Move **RIGHT** to (2,\u202f3)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (2,\u202f3):\n  - LEFT (1,\u202f3) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n  - RIGHT (3,\u202f3) \u2192 empty\n  - UP (2,\u202f4) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (2,\u202f2) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n- **Result:** two safe exits next turn (RIGHT and UP). You move away from the left edge.\n- **Path to apples:** The apple at (1,\u202f6) is farther; you\u2019d need to move up then left, which may be limited by your tail. The apple at (5,\u202f4) is reachable by moving right/up later.\n\n#### Enemy considerations\n- The enemy is at (6,\u202f8). Its possible moves this turn are (5,\u202f8), (7,\u202f8), (6,\u202f9), or (6,\u202f7). None of those threaten your current position or the only safe moves you have.\n- There is no immediate head\u2011on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Preference\n\n**UP** is the better choice because:\n- It gives you **three safe exits** next turn, maximizing flexibility.\n- It positions you closer to the apple at (1,\u202f6) with a cleaner path (UP, UP, RIGHT, UP) without needing to backtrack.\n- It keeps you away from the left edge where you have fewer exit options.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Short\u2011term plan\n\n1. **Move UP to (1,\u202f4).**  \n   - This yields three safe exits next turn and aligns you to head toward the apple at (1,\u202f6).  \n   - Aim to move UP again to (1,\u202f5), then RIGHT to (2,\u202f5), and finally UP to (1,\u202f6) if it\u2019s still there.  \n2. **Monitor the enemy** \u2013 if it moves away from column\u202f6 (e.g., toward (7,\u202f8) or (6,\u202f9)), you may have a chance to swing right later and claim the apple at (5,\u202f4) or (7,\u202f1).  \n3. **Stay aware of your tail** \u2013 after moving up/right you\u2019ll need to keep the tail in a position that doesn\u2019t block your path.\n\nUP",

The only move that threatens an apple is (7,\u202f7) (the apple at (7,\u202f7)).

The apple at (5,\u202f4) is reachable by moving right/up later.\n- **Tail considerations:** Your tail will be at (1,\u202f1) after this move, giving you more flexibility.\n\n#### Move **UP** to (1,\u202f6)\n- **Apple?** Yes \u2013 you will eat the apple at (1,\u202f6) and grow by 1 segment.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (1,\u202f6):\n  - LEFT (0,\u202f6) \u2192 empty\n  - RIGHT (2,\u202f6) \u2192 empty\n  - UP (1,\u202f7) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (1,\u202f5) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n- **Result:** three safe exits next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, UP). You gain a point and remain flexible.\n- **Path to apples:** After eating, you can head toward the apple at (5,\u202f4) by moving RIGHT and DOWN later. The apple at (7,\u202f1) is farther down and right; you can still reach it if you move down later.\n- **Tail considerations:** Your tail will be at (0,\u202f3) after this move, giving you plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy considerations\n\n- The enemy is at (7,\u202f7). Its possible moves this turn are (6,\u202f7) (blocked by its own body), (8,\u202f7), (7,\u202f8) (blocked by its own body), or (7,\u202f6). The only move that threatens an apple is (7,\u202f6) (the apple at (7,\u202f1)). If the enemy moves to (7,\u202f6), it will eat that apple, but it cannot reach any of the apples near you.\n- There is no immediate head\u2011on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Preference\n\n**UP** is the best choice because:\n- It lets you eat the apple at (1,\u202f6) immediately, gaining a point.\n- It gives you three safe exits next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, UP), keeping you flexible.\n- It moves you away from the left edge where you would have fewer options.\n- It does not bring you closer to any potential enemy conflict.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Short\u2011term plan\n\n1. **Move UP to (1,\u202f6).**\n   - On the next turn, you will have 7 points. Re\u2011evaluate the board:\n     - The apple at (5,\u202f4) is a good target; you can move RIGHT to (2,\u202f6) then DOWN to (2,\u202f5) and RIGHT to (3,\u202f5) to head toward it.\n     - Keep monitoring the enemy; if it moves away from column\u202f6, you may have a chance to swing right later and claim the apple at (7,\u202f1) or (8,\u202f3).\n2. **Stay aware of your tail** \u2013 after moving up and right you\u2019ll need to keep the tail in a position that doesn\u2019t block your path.\n3. **Avoid the left edge** where possible to keep multiple exit options available.\n\nUP",

Prioritizing apple collection and maintaining central positioning, DOWN offers the best balance of safety and future options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving DOWN, aim to continue downward toward the apples at (8,4) and (8,3).

Evaluating each safe move\n\n#### Move **LEFT** to (0,\u202f6)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (0,\u202f6):\n  - LEFT (off\u2011board) \u2192 dead\n  - RIGHT (1,\u202f6) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n  - UP (0,\u202f7) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (0,\u202f5) \u2192 empty\n- **Result:** only two safe exits next turn (UP, DOWN). You would be pinned against the left edge with limited options.\n- **Path to apples:** The apple at (1,\u202f9) is far up on the left edge; reaching it later would require moving UP from (0,\u202f6), but you would quickly run out of exits. The apple at (5,\u202f4) is far right; you would need to move away from the left edge, which is constrained by your tail.\n\n#### Move **RIGHT** to (2,\u202f6)\n- **Apple?** No.\n- **Next\u2011turn exits** from (2,\u202f6):\n  - LEFT (1,\u202f6) \u2192 your own body (blocked)\n  - RIGHT (3,\u202f6) \u2192 empty\n  - UP (2,\u202f7) \u2192 empty\n  - DOWN (2,\u202f5) \u2192 empty\n- **Result:** three safe exits next turn (RIGHT, UP, DOWN). You move away from the left edge and keep the board open.\n- **Path to apples:** The apple at (5,\u202f4) is reachable by moving RIGHT and then DOWN later. The apple at (7,\u202f1) is farther down and right; you can still reach it if you move down later.

You move up and keep flexibility.\n- **Path to apples:** The apple at (1,\u202f9) is two rows up on the left edge; you could reach it by moving UP twice then LEFT, but you would need to be careful about running out of exits. The apple at (5,\u202f4) is reachable by moving RIGHT and then DOWN later.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy considerations\n\n- The enemy is at (8,\u202f7).

The apple at (8,\u202f4) is one row above (8,\u202f3); the enemy could also reach it with two DOWN moves.\n- There is no immediate head\u2011on collision risk with your current position.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Preference\n\n**RIGHT** is the best choice because:\n- It moves you away from the left edge where you would have fewer exits next turn.\n- It gives you three safe exits next turn (RIGHT, UP, DOWN), keeping you flexible.\n- It brings you closer to the apple at (5,\u202f4), which is a good target.\n- It does not bring you closer to the enemy\u2019s likely path toward the apples at (8,\u202f3) and (8,\u202f4).\n\n**UP** is also reasonable (three safe exits) but moves you toward the left edge apple at (1,\u202f9), which is harder to reach without running out of exits.\n\n**LEFT** is less desirable because it pins you against the left edge with only two exits next turn.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Short\u2011term plan\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (2,\u202f6).**\n   - On the next turn, you will have three safe exits (RIGHT, UP, DOWN). Aim to move toward the apple at (5,\u202f4) by moving RIGHT to (3,\u202f6) then DOWN to (3,\u202f5) and then RIGHT again if needed.\n   - Keep monitoring the enemy; if it moves away from column\u202f8, you may have a chance to swing right later and claim the apple at (7,\u202f1) or (8,\u202f3).\n2. **Stay aware of your tail** \u2013 after moving right you\u2019ll need to keep the tail in a position that doesn\u2019t block your path.\n3. **Avoid the left edge** where possible to keep multiple exit options available.\n\nRIGHT",
