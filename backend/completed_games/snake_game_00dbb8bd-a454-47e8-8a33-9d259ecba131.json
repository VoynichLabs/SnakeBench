To clarify, perhaps your last move was UP, and now you're at (4,2).\n\nHealthy assumptions based on info:\n- You are at (4,2), possibly moved UP from (4,1).\n- Your body is empty, so no risk of self-collision.\n- Enemy snake is at (3,1), which is to your bottom-left, but not directly on your path unless you move down or left.\n- Your current position is at (4,2), with potential moves:\n\n  - UP: (4,3) \u2014 moving upward, away from enemy at (3,1), safe, and toward higher y-values.\n  - RIGHT: (5,2) \u2014 safe, and progressing toward apples at (6,4) and (8,1).\n  - DOWN: (4,1) \u2014 your previous position, so moving down again would be back and possible collision with walls or self if your body was there.\n  - LEFT: (3,2) \u2014 safe, but enemy at (3,1) is below, so no immediate danger.\n\nConsidering apple locations:\n- (6,4): far to the right and up.\n- (8,1): far right, lower.\n- (3,6): to the left and up.\n- (2,3): further to the left and slightly up.\n- (3,7): more left and further up.\n\nGoals:\n- Moving toward apples will maximize points.\n- The closest reachable apples seem to be at (3,6) or (6,4).\n\nOptions:\n1. Moving RIGHT:\n   - To (5,2). This path is promising because it progresses toward apples at (6,4) and (8,1). It's safe, not blocked.\n2. Moving UP:\n   - To (4,3). It moves upward, closer to (3,6) and (6,4). Also safe.\n3. Moving LEFT:\n   - To (3,2). It is safe; heading toward apples at (3,6) and (3,7). But possibly less efficient because to reach (3,6) you'd need to go further up afterward.\n4. Moving DOWN:\n   - To (4,1). It is likely to be less strategic, especially if your last position was at (4,2).\n\nGiven all this, moving RIGHT seems attractive because:\n- It keeps you moving closer to the apples at (6,4) and (8,1).\n- It avoids enemy snake's position.\n- It offers a clear, safe move in the current scenario.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP is also safe and pushes upward toward (3,6).\n\nHowever, considering the current position and the goal to approach the apple at (6,4), moving RIGHT seems more direct and promising.\n\nNext turn: I will choose to move RIGHT.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

Moving RIGHT seems to be a straightforward, safe choice to progress toward that apple.\n\nConsidering safety:\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (4,2): (5,2). No immediate threats detected\u2014no walls or enemy snakes in this cell.\n\n- Moving UP from current position: (4,3). Safe, and it positions us closer to apples at (3,6) or (3,7), but might require additional turns.\n\n- Moving LEFT: (3,2). Also safe and closer to apples at (3,6) and (3,7). Could be beneficial if I plan to go left then up.\n\n- Moving DOWN: (4,1). Less promising as it moves away from apples.\n\nStrategy:\n\n- Since the current move is already RIGHT, and moving right now progresses toward the (6,4) apple efficiently, I will continue with that to make steady progress.\n\nNext turn planning:\n\n- After moving RIGHT, from (5,2), I can decide whether to go up or right further, depending on apple positions.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n- The best immediate move for a safe and goal-oriented approach is to continue RIGHT.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
