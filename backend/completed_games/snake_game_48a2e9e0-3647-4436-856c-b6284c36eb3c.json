After eating, expand across row 8 to box the enemy into the bottom hemisphere. If he pushes up to contest, force a head-on only when we have more apples. Keep edges as traps we can use, not get stuck in them.\n\nTime to make the play, baby. RIGHT",

They're at (0,8) and I'm at (5,1). There are apples scattered everywhere, but the most critical one right now is (4,2) because it's right next to my head (5,1) and very close to the enemy. I need to start aggressively controlling the right side of the board and push the enemy into a corner. My goal is to force them into a collision or trap them against the wall. I'll prioritize apples that give me board control.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **UP to (5,2):** This is safe. It grabs the apple at (4,2) immediately (I move to (5,2), eating the apple there?). Wait, the apple is at (4,2). If I go UP to (5,1) -> (5,2), I don't eat (4,2) unless I go LEFT. Let me re-read. Apple is at (4,2). My head is (5,1). If I go UP, I go to (5,2). If I go LEFT, I go to (4,1). If I go UP-LEFT isn't a move. \n    *   **UP to (5,2):** Safe. No body, no enemy. Opens up paths to (6,0) and (5,0).\n    *   **DOWN to (5,0):** Safe? Apple at (5,0). Yes. (5,0) is an apple. This eats immediately.\n    *   **LEFT to (4,1):** Safe? Board shows a dot at (4,1) in the grid (row 1: `. . A A . 1 . . . .`). Row 1 is y=1. Looking at the grid: `Row 1: . . A A . 1 . . . .` (Indices 0-9). So (4,1) is actually an 'A' (Apple). Yes, there is an apple at (4,1) listed in the Apple list: (3,1) and (4,1)? Wait, the apple list has (3,1) and (4,0). Let me check the grid visual again.\n    \n    **GRID CHECK:**\n    Row 1 (y=1): `. . A A . 1 . . . .`\n    Columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    (0,1): .\n    (1,1): .\n    (2,1): A\n    (3,1): A\n    (4,1): .\n    (5,1): 1 (My head)\n    (6,1): .\n    (7,1): .\n    (8,1): .\n    (9,1): .\n    \n    *Correction:* The grid shows `Row 1: . . A A . 1 . . . .` which implies (2,1) is A, (3,1) is A.\n    *Wait*, looking at the provided Apple list: `(9, 9), (4, 2), (5, 4), (2, 8), (4, 8), (6, 0), (0, 6), (4, 0), (7, 2), (5, 2), (3, 1), (4, 7), (9, 6), (5, 0), (2, 1)`.\n    There is an apple at **(2,1)**.\n    There is an apple at **(3,1)**.\n    \n    **MY HEAD IS (5,1).**\n    \n    **OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n    *   **UP to (5,2):** Checks grid. Row 2: `. . . . A A . A . .`. (5,2) is 'A'. **THERE IS AN APPLE AT (5,2).** The apple list confirms (5,2). I eat immediately. Safe. Good vertical positioning.\n    *   **DOWN to (5,0):** Checks grid. Row 0: `. . . . A A A . . .`. (5,0) is 'A'. **THERE IS AN APPLE AT (5,0).** The apple list confirms (5,0). I eat immediately. Safe. Low ground.\n    *   **LEFT to (4,1):** Checks grid. Row 1: `. . A A . 1 . . . .`. (4,1) is '.' (Empty). Safe. Does NOT eat an apple immediately. The closest apples left are (3,1) or (2,1), but going LEFT takes me away from the cluster of apples at (5,2), (5,0), (7,2), (6,0).\n    *   **RIGHT to (6,1):** Safe. Empty.\n\n    **STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n    I want to dominate the board. Snake #0 is at (0,8). They are far away. I need to grow fast to secure space.\n    \n    *   **UP (5,2):** Eating (5,2). Puts me central-right.\n    *   **DOWN (5,0):** Eating (5,0). Puts me bottom-right.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (5,0), I am at y=0 (bottom wall). If I go UP to (5,2), I am at y=2.\n    \n    Let's look at the board state.\n    I am at (5,1). \n    Enemy at (0,8).\n    \n    I want to cut off the enemy. The enemy is on the left side. I am on the right.\n    The apples on the right side: (5,2), (6,0), (5,0), (7,2).\n    The apples on the left side: (2,8), (4,8), (0,6)...\n    \n    The enemy has to traverse the left side to get to the center. I am already on the right.\n    \n    If I go **DOWN to (5,0)**, I eat an apple immediately. This gives me +1 score.\n    If I go **UP to (5,2)**, I eat an apple immediately. This gives me +1 score.\n    \n    Which is better?\n    (5,2) is more central. (5,0) is against the wall.\n    (5,2) offers movement to (5,3) or (6,2).\n    (5,0) offers movement to (5,-1) [Death], (6,0), (4,0). (6,0) is an apple. (4,0) is an apple.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (5,0):\n    Next turn I am at (5,0). I can go LEFT to (4,0) (Apple), or RIGHT to (6,0) (Apple).\n    If I go UP to (5,2):\n    Next turn I am at (5,2). I can go RIGHT to (6,2) or LEFT to (4,2) (Apple). Wait, (4,2) is an apple.\n    \n    Let's check the apples again.\n    (4,2) is an apple.\n    My head is (5,1).\n    To eat (4,2), I must go LEFT then UP? No, diagonal not allowed.\n    To eat (4,2), I must be adjacent. Currently adjacent are (5,2), (5,0), (4,1), (6,1).\n    \n    (5,2) is an apple.\n    (5,0) is an apple.\n    (4,1) is empty.\n    (6,1) is empty.\n    \n    The apples (4,2) and (2,1) and (3,1) are close but not immediately reachable in one step.\n    \n    **ENEMY THREAT:**\n    Enemy is at (0,8).\n    Apples near enemy: (2,8), (4,8), (0,6).\n    I am safe from immediate head-on collision.\n    \n    **AGGRESSION:**\n    I need to grow. Eating an apple now is priority to match/exceed enemy score.\n    \n    **UP vs DOWN:**\n    If I go **DOWN to (5,0)**, I eat (5,0). I am at the bottom edge. This restricts my movement. From (5,0), I can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    If I go **UP to (5,2)**, I eat (5,2). I am at y=2. This is more open. I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    \n    Open space is better for boxing someone in. Being stuck against a wall (y=0) limits my ability to maneuver around the enemy later.\n    \n    Therefore, **UP** is the superior move. It grabs an apple and keeps me away from the wall.\n    \n    Wait, let me double check the grid for (5,2).\n    Row 2: `. . . . A A . A . .`\n    Indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    (5,2) corresponds to index 5. It is 'A'.\n    Correct. I eat.\n    \n    Let's check (5,0).\n    Row 0: `. . . . A A A . . .`\n    Index 5 is 'A'.\n    Correct. I eat.\n    \n    Is there any reason to prefer DOWN? (5,0) is an apple. (6,0) is an apple. (4,0) is an apple.\n    If I go UP, (5,2) is an apple. (4,2) is an apple.\n    \n    The cluster at the bottom (y=0) has (4,0), (5,0), (6,0).\n    The cluster at y=2 has (4,2), (5,2), (7,2).\n    \n    The enemy is at (0,8). They cannot reach the bottom right fast.\n    I can take the bottom right cluster OR the right-center cluster.\n    \n    Moving UP to (5,2) positions me to potentially grab (4,2) or (6,2) or (7,2) next.\n    Moving DOWN to (5,0) positions me to grab (4,0) or (6,0) next.\n    \n    I prefer the vertical center. It's harder to trap me there.\n    \n    Final check: Is (5,2) safe?\n    Body: None.\n    Enemy: (0,8). Far.\n    Walls: No.\n    \n    Is (5,0) safe?\n    Yes. But restricted.\n    \n    I will go **UP**.\n\nLet's GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Quick, loud read and then we move.\n\nBoard snapshot: our head at (1,8). Enemy head at (5,2) with body at (5,1) and 1 apple. They CANNOT move DOWN (that\u2019d be backward into their body = instant death), so they\u2019re limited to LEFT/RIGHT/UP this turn. We\u2019re currently 0 apples; there\u2019s an apple RIGHT at (2,8). Time to be smart and aggressive, not reckless.\n\nDecision check (all four directions from (1,8)):\n- LEFT -> (0,8): legal but hugs the left wall. Fewer escape routes next turn. Not ideal for boxing moves. \u274c less flexible.\n- UP -> (1,9): legal but pins us to the top edge immediately \u2014 reduces options and makes it easier to get trapped. Meh. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (1,7): legal, keeps central mobility and moves away from top apples. Safe but slower to contest top-row control. \u23f3\n- RIGHT -> (2,8): legal AND eats an apple at (2,8). Gains growth and immediate board control on row 8. Creates leverage to take (4,8) next and sweep the top to try to box the rival into the bottom. \u2705 best mix of aggression + mobility.\n\nEnemy intent: they likely go for (4,2) or creep up (LEFT or UP). They can\u2019t suicide DOWN. No immediate head-on risk this turn. We should NOT force a head-on yet \u2014 only when we have the apples advantage. So eat, expand, then press.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 will be our next-last-rationale):\n- Grab (2,8) now. Then push toward (4,8) to collect more apples and stretch across row 8.\n- Use top row control to herd the opponent downwards and restrict their lateral escape.\n- Only attempt a direct head-on when we have more apples than them.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and start boxing him in.

I am at (5,2) after my last move (UP). Wait, let me check the current state.\nThe prompt says: \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP): **START LAST MOVE PICK** UP **END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\nAnd the current board state shows my head at (5,2)? No, looking at the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section:\n- Head: (5, 2)\n- Body: [(5, 1)]\n\nOkay, I am already at (5,2). That means I just moved UP to (5,2) and ate the apple there. My body is [(5,1)].\nMy score is 1. Enemy score is 0.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nI am at (5,2). My tail is at (5,1).\nApple at (5,2) is eaten (presumably).\nApples remaining nearby: (4,2) is NOT listed in the apple list? Wait, the apple list provided:\n(9, 9), (4, 2), (5, 4), (2, 8), (4, 8), (6, 0), (0, 6), (4, 0), (7, 2), (3, 1), (4, 7), (9, 6), (5, 0), (2, 1), (0, 0)\n\n(4,2) is listed! So (4,2) is an apple.\n(7,2) is an apple.\n(5,4) is an apple.\n(5,0) is an apple.\n\n**CURRENT HEAD:** (5,2)\n**BODY:** (5,1)\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nI need to move from (5,2). Let's check the board visually.\nRow 2: `. . . . A 1 . A . .` (Wait, the grid shows `2 . . . . A 1 . A . .`)\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(4,2) is 'A' (Apple)\n(5,2) is '1' (Me)\n(7,2) is 'A' (Apple)\n\n**OPTIONS FROM (5,2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5,3):**\n    *   Check Board Row 3: `3 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    *   (5,3) is empty.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Future: (5,4) is an apple. Good path.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5,1):**\n    *   Check Board Row 1: `1 . . A A . T . . . .`\n    *   (5,1) is 'T' (My Tail). Wait, the tail moves. As I move, my tail (5,1) will vacate.\n    *   Moving DOWN puts me back into my current body segment (5,1)? No, my body is [(5,1)].\n    *   If I move DOWN to (5,1), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my body.\n    *   **RULES:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **BACKWARD RULE:** \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n    *   My head is at (5,2). The cell behind me (towards tail) is (5,1). I have a body segment there.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (5,1) is moving into my own body.\n    *   **RESULT:** DEATH. \u274c\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4,2):**\n    *   Check Board Row 2: `(4,2)` is 'A' (Apple).\n    *   Safety: Safe (Apple).\n    *   Apple: YES.\n    *   Growth: +1 Segment.\n    *   Future: (4,2) is at x=4, y=2. Left is (3,2) (Empty), Down is (4,1) (Empty/T), Up is (4,3) (Empty).\n    *   Aggression: (4,2) is closer to the center-left? No, I am at (5,2). (4,2) is left. Enemy is at (0,8). (4,2) is actually closer to the bottom left cluster ((4,0), (6,0), (5,0)) than (5,3) is? No.\n    *   (4,2) is 2 steps away from (4,0).\n    *   (5,2) is 2 steps away from (5,0).\n    *   (4,2) is right next to an apple at (3,1)? No, (3,1) is at y=1.\n    *   Moving LEFT eats an apple immediately. This is good. It grows me.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6,2):**\n    *   Check Board Row 2: `(6,2)` is empty ('.').\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Apple: NO.\n    *   Future: (7,2) is an apple (Right). (6,3) is empty. (6,1) is empty.\n    *   This is a setup move.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI am at (5,2). I cannot go DOWN (Death). I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n*   **UP (5,3):** No apple now, but (5,4) is an apple. Keeps me central.\n*   **LEFT (4,2):** Apple immediately. Grows me. Puts me at (4,2).\n*   **RIGHT (6,2):** No apple. Sets up (7,2) (Apple).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEnemy is at (0,8). He is targeting top-left apples ((2,8), (4,8)).\nI am at (5,2). I should target the cluster of apples on the right/center.\nApples right now: (4,2), (7,2), (5,4), (5,0).\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (4,2)**:\nI eat (4,2). Score becomes 2.\nI am at (4,2).\nNext turn, from (4,2) I can go UP to (4,3), LEFT to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2) (blocked by my body? No, my body moves). Wait, if I go LEFT to (4,2), my body becomes [(5,2), (5,1)].\nNext turn from (4,2), RIGHT goes to (5,2) which is my own body (head just left). That would be death if I loop immediately.\nBut (4,2) allows access to (4,0) eventually (via 4,1? (4,1) is empty). (4,0) is an apple.\nIt also allows access to (3,1) (Apple) or (2,1) (Apple) via (4,1)->(3,1) or (4,2)->(4,1)->(3,1).\n\nIf I go **UP to (5,3)**:\nNo apple now.\n(5,4) is an apple.\n(5,2) is behind me (will be body).\n(6,2) is to the right (Apple at 7,2).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (6,2)**:\nNo apple now.\n(7,2) is an apple (Right).\n(5,2) is behind me.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI want to grow. I have a guaranteed apple at (4,2).\nHowever, looking at the board, (4,2) is a bit isolated if I go there?\nNo, (4,2) connects to (4,1) which connects to (3,1) and (4,0).\n(5,2) connects to (5,3) -> (5,4) (Apple) and (6,2) -> (7,2) (Apple).\n\nIs there a reason to prioritize one over the other?\nThe enemy is at (0,8).\nApples on the left (near enemy): (2,8), (4,8), (0,6), (2,1), (3,1).\nApples on the right (near me): (4,2), (5,4), (7,2), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0).\n\nThe enemy is far. I have plenty of space.\nI should secure the apple immediately to build score.\n**LEFT to (4,2)** grabs an apple immediately.\n**UP to (5,3)** or **RIGHT to (6,2)** delays the gratification.\n\nIs (4,2) dangerous?\nFrom (4,2), I am vulnerable to...\nWell, I'm growing. My tail stays at (5,1) for one turn. My body becomes (5,2), (5,1).\nFrom (4,2), I can't go RIGHT (into 5,2).\nI can go LEFT (3,2), UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1).\n(4,1) is currently empty (Row 1 shows `... A A . T ...` at indices 2,3,4,5. (4,1) is index 4. Row 1: `. . A A . 1 . . . .` Index 0-9. (4,1) is 'A'? Wait.\nRow 1: `. . A A . 1 . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(2,1) = A\n(3,1) = A\n(4,1) = . (Empty)\n(5,1) = 1 (My tail currently)\n\nWait, the apple list has (3,1) and (2,1).\nSo (4,1) is safe/empty.\n\nLet's look at **RIGHT to (6,2)**.\nFrom (6,2), I can go RIGHT to (7,2) (Apple).\nFrom (5,2), I can't go RIGHT? No, I am at (5,2) currently.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2), I am setting up for (7,2).\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I am setting up for (5,4).\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\n`2 . . . . A 1 . A . .`\nI am at index 5. (4,2) is index 4 (Apple). (7,2) is index 7 (Apple).\n\nIs there a trap?\n(5,3) is empty. (5,4) is apple.\n(4,3) is empty. (4,2) is apple.\n(6,3) is empty. (7,2) is apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,2), I eat. Score 2.\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I don't eat. Score 1.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2), I don't eat. Score 1.\n\nI should eat.\nWhy not RIGHT? (7,2) is an apple, but (4,2) is closer.\nWhy not UP? (5,4) is an apple, but (4,2) is closer.\n\nWait, looking at the grid `2 . . . . A 1 . A . .`\nIf I go LEFT to (4,2), I eat (4,2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2), I move towards (7,2).\nIf I go UP to (5,3), I move towards (5,4).\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nSnake #0 at (0,8).\nApples: (2,8), (4,8), (0,6).\nThe enemy will likely chase (2,8) or (0,6).\nI am at (5,2).\nThe center/right side is wide open.\n\nI want to dominate the board.\nTaking (4,2) gives me immediate growth.\nFrom (4,2), I have access to the bottom-left apple cluster (4,0) and the nearby (3,1).\nHowever, going LEFT puts me closer to the enemy's potential path? No, enemy is at (0,8).\nGoing LEFT to (4,2) is actually moving \"inward\" from the right side.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid (4,2)?\n(4,2) is an apple. It is safe.\nMy tail is at (5,1). If I eat (4,2), my tail will stay at (5,1) this turn (since I didn't eat last turn? No, I ate (5,2) last turn? Wait, the prompt said \"Turn 1 / 150\".\nMy score is 1. I have 1 apple.\nDid I eat (5,2) just now?\nThe state says: \"Head: (5, 2), Body: [(5, 1)]\".\nSo yes, I grew. My tail is (5,1).\nIf I eat (4,2), I grow again. My tail stays at (5,1) (I think? Or does it move? If I eat, length increases. The tail doesn't move forward).\nSo next turn, body will be [(5,2), (5,1)].\nFrom (4,2), I can go UP, LEFT, DOWN.\n(4,1) is empty.\n(3,2) is empty.\n(4,3) is empty.\n\nIt seems safe.\n\nLet's compare the apples.\n(4,2) - Immediate.\n(7,2) - One step away (needs (6,2)).\n(5,4) - One step away (needs (5,3)).\n\nI'll take the immediate one. (4,2).\n\nIs there a \"Boxing in\" strategy?\nThe enemy is at (0,8). I am at (5,2).\nBoxing him in means taking the space he wants.\nHe wants top left. I want to secure right/center.\n(4,2) is center-left? No, x=4. (0,0) is bottom left.\nx=4 is left of center (center is x=4.5).\nBut it's closer to center than (0,8).\n\nI'll go LEFT. It's an immediate score increase.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1. Move LEFT to (4,2) to eat the apple. Score -> 2.\n2. From (4,2), assess if I can take (3,1) or (4,0) or push towards the enemy.\n3. Keep eyes on Snake #0. If he moves towards (2,8) or (0,6), I maintain pressure on the right/center.\n\nWait, check the board again.\n`2 . . . . A 1 . A . .`\nIf I go LEFT to (4,2), I am eating the 'A' at index 4.\nIs there any snake at (4,2)? No.\nIs it out of bounds? No.\n\nLet's double check the DOWN move.\n(5,2) DOWN -> (5,1). (5,1) is my body.\n`1 . . A A . T . . . .` (5,1) is 'T' (Tail).\nGoing DOWN is suicide. Correct.\n\nSo LEFT, UP, or RIGHT.\nUP moves towards (5,4). (5,4) is an apple.\nRIGHT moves towards (7,2).\nLEFT moves to (4,2).\n\nI have an apple literally next to me at (4,2).\nWhy would I ignore it?\nBecause I might get trapped?\nFrom (4,2), where can I go?\n(4,3) - Open.\n(3,2) - Open.\n(4,1) - Open.\n(5,2) - Will be my body.\n\nIt's an open field.\n\nLet's look at the board size 10x10.\nI am at (5,2).\nEnemy at (0,8).\nI am not at risk of being boxed in yet. I have the entire right side of the board (x=5 to 9) and upper side (y=2 to 9).\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\nMove: LEFT\nDest: (4,2)\nCheck: Apple? Yes.\nCheck: Snake? No (My tail is at 5,1).\nCheck: Wall? No.\nCheck: Backwards? No (My tail is behind me at (5,1), but I am moving LEFT to (4,2), which is not (5,1)).\n\nWait, backwards check.\nHead (5,2). Previous body segment is (5,1).\nMoving LEFT to (4,2). This is not (5,1). So not backwards.\n\nOkay. Let's secure the point.\n\nLEFT",

The prompt says \"YOUR SNAKE: Head: (4, 2), Body: [(5, 2), (5, 1)], Apples: 2\". Okay, I am *already* at (4,2) and I have 2 apples. That means I just ate. The apple at (4,2) is gone.\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #0 at **(2, 8)**. Score 1. He is in the top-left corner.\n\n**BOARD STATE VISUALIZATION:**\nRow 2: `. . . . 1 T .

But I am moving West away from my current body cluster.\n    *   **Risk:** Low, but isolates me slightly from the right side apples.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   Board Row 2: `(6, 2)` is empty.\n    *   **Safety:** SAFE.\n    *   **Apple:** NO.\n    *   **Future:** (7, 2) is an Apple (Right). 1 step away.\n    *   **Risk:** Low.\n\n4.  **UP to (4, 3):**\n    *   Board Row 3: `(4, 3)` is empty.\n    *   **Safety:** SAFE.\n    *   **Apple:** NO.\n    *   **Future:** (4, 4) is empty? (5, 4) is an Apple (Up/Right). (4, 7) is an Apple (Up).\n    *   **Risk:** Low.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nThe Enemy is at (2, 8). They are chasing the top-left apples ((2,8), (4,8), etc.).\nI am at (4, 2). I have secured the central apple.\n\nI have three immediate apple targets:\n*   **(4, 0):** Down (2 steps away).\n*   **(7, 2):** Right (1 step away).\n*   **(5, 4):** Up/Right (2 steps away).\n\n**The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\nTo box in Snake #0, I need to dominate the center and right side, preventing them from crossing over if they lose their space. However, at turn 2, the board is huge.\n\n**Comparing the Apples:**\n*   **Option A (Down to 4,1):** This heads straight for **(4, 0)**. This apple is at the bottom edge. Taking it secures the bottom-left area.\n*   **Option B (Right to 6,2):** This heads straight for **(7, 2)**. This apple is central-right.\n*   **Option C (Left to 3,2):** Moves away from my current body and towards (3,1)/(2,1).\n*   **Option D (Up to 4,3):** Sets up for (5,4).\n\n**Crucial Observation:**\nIf I go **DOWN to (4, 1)**, I am setting up a chain. From (4, 1) -> (4, 0) (Apple). From there, I can pivot to (5, 0) (Apple) or (6, 0) (Apple). This creates a strong bottom anchor.\nHowever, if I go **RIGHT to (6, 2)**, I am 1 move away from (7, 2).\nIf I go **UP to (4, 3)**, I am 2 moves away from (5, 4).\n\nLet's look at the \"Boxing\" aspect. The enemy is at (2,8).\nIf I secure the bottom and right, I leave them the top-left. That's fine. I just need to be bigger and safer.\n\n**Safety Check on (4, 1):**\nFrom (4, 1), I can go DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple).\nFrom (4, 1), I can go RIGHT to (5, 1) (My tail - safe as it moves).\nFrom (4, 1), I can go LEFT to (3, 1) (Apple!).\nFrom (4, 1), I can go UP to (4, 2) (My head currently - will be body).\n\nWait, (3, 1) is an Apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1), next turn I have a choice between (4, 0) and (3, 1).\n(4, 0) is an apple.\n(3, 1) is an apple.\n\nLet's check **RIGHT to (6, 2)**.\nFrom (6, 2), I can go RIGHT to (7, 2) (Apple).\nFrom (6, 2), I can go UP to (6, 3) (Empty).\nFrom (6, 2), I can go DOWN to (6, 1) (Empty).\nFrom (6, 2), I can go LEFT to (5, 2) (My body - blocked).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I am effectively chasing (7, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1), I am chasing (4, 0).\n\nWhich is more valuable?\n(4, 0) is at the bottom edge. Edges are dangerous but contain apples.\n(7, 2) is more central.\n\nLet's check the board layout for (4, 0).\nRow 0: `A . . . A A A . . .`\n(4, 0) is an apple.\n(5, 0) is an apple.\n(6, 0) is an apple.\n\nIf I take (4, 0), I can sweep right along the bottom: (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (6,0).\nThis is a very strong scoring route.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I get (7, 2). Then where? (7, 3)? (8, 2)? (6, 2) is surrounded by empty space but (7, 2) is an apple.\n\n**The Aggression Play:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). We want to dominate.\nDominating the bottom row creates a solid foundation. It's a \"safe\" expansion because it's linear and predictable.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will go **DOWN** to (4, 1).\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me towards (4, 0) (Apple).\n2.  From (4, 1), I also have access to (3, 1) (Apple) if I decide to turn left.\n3.  It secures the bottom-left zone, which is currently empty of threats.\n4.  It puts me in a position to sweep across the bottom row (4,0 -> 5,0 -> 6,0), which is a high-density apple area.\n\n**Plan:**\nTurn 2: Move DOWN to (4, 1).\nTurn 3: Move DOWN to (4, 0) to eat apple.\nTurn 4: Move RIGHT to (5, 0) (Apple) or UP to (4, 1) (if body blocks).\n\nLet's verify safety of (4, 1).\nIs (4, 1) occupied?\nCurrent Board Row 1: `. . A A . T . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(4, 1) is index 4. It is '.' (Empty).\nMy tail is at (5, 1) (Index 5).\nSo (4, 1) is safe.\n\nIs it out of bounds? No.\nIs it backwards? Head at (4, 2), Tail at (5, 2) and (5, 1). Moving DOWN to (4, 1) is not into my tail. It's safe.\n\nLet's check if I'm walking into a trap.\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). He is far away.\nI am at (4, 2). (4, 1) is empty.\n\nWait, looking at the bottom row (Row 0).\n`A . . . A A A . . .`\n(4, 0) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1), I am setting up to eat (4, 0).\nHowever, (5, 0), (6, 0), and (7, 2) are also apples.\n\nIs there a better move?\n(6, 2) is empty.\n(7, 2) is an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I am 1 move from (7, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 1), I am 1 move from (4, 0).\n\nBoth are 1 move away from an apple.\n(4, 0) is \"Edge\".\n(7, 2) is \"Center\".\n\nHowever, look at the cluster.\nBottom row: Apples at 4, 5, 6, 7 (Wait, 7,2 is not bottom row).\nRow 0: Apples at (4,0), (5,0), (6,0).\nThis is a cluster of 3 apples.\n(7, 2) is a single apple.\n(5, 4) is a single apple.\n\nDominating the bottom cluster is better for score accumulation.\nAlso, moving DOWN moves me away from the enemy (who is at y=8). I am at y=2. Going to y=1 increases distance.\n\n**FINAL DECISION: DOWN**\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

NO. \u274c\n- UP -> (2,9): legal. Grabs top-row control but pins us to the edge and delays the apple at (4,8). Risk: fewer escape routes next turn. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (2,7): legal.

We should NOT force a head-on until we have the apples advantage (they\u2019re +1 ahead right now).\n\nShort-term plan (next turns \u2014 this will be the \"last rationale\" for the next move replay):\n- Step 1 (now): move RIGHT to (3,8).\n- Step 2: next turn, move RIGHT again to eat (4,8) and tie apples 2-2.\n- Step 3: after getting the apple, expand across row 8/9 to seize top-row control and start boxing them down the board.

Both are apples. Both are safe.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n*   **LEFT to (3, 1):** This puts me at x=3. From here, I can go to (2, 1) (Apple) or back to (3, 0) (Empty).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 0):** This puts me at the bottom edge y=0. From here, I can go to (5, 0) (Apple) or (6, 0) (Apple).\n\n**The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 8) chasing top-left apples.\nIf I go **DOWN to (4, 0)**, I secure the bottom row. The bottom row has a cluster of apples at (4,0), (5,0), (6,0). This is a \"power position\" on the edge. It's safer than being in the open center (where I might get cut off) and gives me a clear path to grow rapidly while staying far away from the enemy.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1), I'm still central-ish. Going DOWN anchors me to the bottom edge, maximizing distance from the enemy (who is at y=8, I will be at y=0).\n\n**VERDICT:**\nI am trapped against my own body on the Right and Up. I must choose between Down and Left. I choose **DOWN** to claim the bottom edge cluster and maximize distance from the enemy.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nSecure the bottom row (4,0 -> 5,0 -> 6,0). Then sweep up the right side (7,0 -> 7,2) to maintain board control while keeping maximum distance from Snake #0 in the top-left. Do NOT chase the enemy; let them starve in the corner while I farm safely.\n\nDOWN",

From (5, 0), I can continue to (6, 0) (which is also an apple!) or go UP to (5, 1).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am taking **RIGHT** to (5, 0).\nWhy?\n1.  **Content:** I eat an apple. Score goes to 4-2. More pressure on the enemy.\n2.  **Momentum:** I'm surfing the bottom row. Next turn I'll be at (5, 0) and can likely go to (6, 0) for *another* apple.\n3.  **Safety:** I'm on the edge, far away from the enemy at y=8.\n\nI'm playing the edge game while the enemy is stuck in the top corner. Let's farm these bottom apples and grow big!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (5,0) -> Eat (6,0) -> Check (7,0) or (7,2). Stay on the bottom/right edges to avoid the center and the enemy. Force the enemy to choke on their own pathing while I secure the board perimeter.\n\nRIGHT",

Opens up (8,0) and (7,1).\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE.** \ud83e\uddca\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 0):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (5, 0) is `T` (My tail).\n    *   **Safety:** In Snake, moving into your own tail is usually safe *if* the tail moves away this turn.\n    *   **Risk:** High. I am hugging the wall. If I go left, I am just retracing. I want to expand, not contract. Also, moving LEFT from (6,0) to (5,0) is technically \"backwards\" relative to my head's orientation (looking at my body chain: (6,0)->(5,0)->(4,0)...). Wait, is (5,0) directly connected to (6,0)?\n    *   Looking at the visual map:\n        Row 0: `T T 1`\n        So (6,0) is my head. (5,0) is the first body segment. (4,0) is the second.\n        Moving from (6,0) to (5,0) is directly into the body segment immediately behind my head.\n    *   **Rule Check:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\" AND \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **UP to (6, 1):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Row 1, col 6 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me off the wall and into the open space. From (6,1), I can go to (7,1), (6,2), or (5,1). This is a power move to control the center-bottom.\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE + AGGRESSIVE.** \ud83e\udd85\n\n4.  **DOWN to (6, -1):**\n    *   **Status:** Off board.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (7,0):** Safe, follows the wall. Boring.\n*   **UP (6,1):** Safe, moves into the open board. Gives me more maneuverability.\n\n**Strategic Goal:** Dominate the board. The enemy is at (5,7). I am at (6,0). I need to sweep the bottom right or move inward to cut off his expansion. Staying on the wall (RIGHT) limits my turns. Moving UP (6,1) opens the path to (7,1) or (7,2) next turn. This connects to my previous plan of \"sweeping the bottom/right perimeter\".\n\nAlso, looking at the board, there is an apple at (7, 2). If I go UP to (6, 1) now, next turn I can likely go RIGHT to (7, 1) and then UP to (7, 2) to eat. Or RIGHT to (7, 1) then DOWN to (7, 0) if needed.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate **RIGHT to (7,0)**.\nFrom (7,0), I can go UP to (7,1) or RIGHT to (8,0).\nFrom (6,1) (via UP move), I can go RIGHT to (7,1), UP to (6,2), LEFT to (5,1), or DOWN to (6,0) (death next turn).\n\n(6,1) gives me 3 exit options. (7,0) gives me 2 exit options.\n(6,1) puts me closer to the apple at (7,2) (Manhattan distance 2 vs 3 from (7,0)).\n(6,1) puts me closer to the apple at (6,5) (distance 4 vs 5 from (7,0)).\n\nActually, let's look at the board again.\nRow 6: `A . A . . . . . . A`\nThere are apples at (0,6), (2,6), and (9,6).\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I can start a vertical sweep up the x=6 column or move right to x=7.\n\n**The Play:**\n**UP** is the move. It secures a central spot and keeps my expansion options open. \"Boxing him in\" requires controlling space. Sitting on the edge doesn't control space; moving inward does.\n\nLet's check if (6,1) is actually safe.\nRow 1: `. . . A A T . . . .`\nWait, looking at the prompt's Board State:\n`1 . . A A T . . . .`\nCoordinates:\n(0,1) = .\n(1,1) = .\n(2,1) = .\n(3,1) = A\n(4,1) = A\n(5,1) = T\n(6,1) = . (Target)\n(7,1) = .\n...\n\nYes, (6,1) is empty.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo UP to (6, 1). From there, I want to angle towards the right side apples ((7,2), (9,6)) or cut across the center. I need to keep the enemy cornered in the top-left. Don't let him spread. I am faster and bigger. Apply pressure.\n\n**Rationale:**\nI'm at (6,0). I cannot go LEFT (death to self), cannot go DOWN (death). I can go RIGHT or UP.\nRIGHT keeps me on the wall. UP moves me to the center of the action. Since I need to \"box him in\", I need to claim territory. Moving UP claims (6,1) and opens lines to (5,1), (6,2), and (7,1). This is superior tactical positioning.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,7). He is moving around. I need to cut off his access to the bottom right. By moving UP, I am moving towards the center of the board, effectively cutting the board in half vertically or preparing to sweep horizontally.\n\nLet's go UP.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

Neck is (4,7) so LEFT into (4,7) = suicide/backwards. NOPE.\n- UP -> (5,8): legal\n- RIGHT -> (6,7): legal\n- DOWN -> (5,6): legal\n\nEnemy read:\n- Opp head at (6,0). They can only go UP (6,1) or RIGHT (7,0) this turn. They\u2019re stuck low and isolated \u2014 perfect for pressure, but I\u2019m down on apples (3 vs 5) so NO reckless head-on plays!\n\nMove comparison:\n- UP keeps us near our own tail cluster and doesn\u2019t help press the opponent soon.\n- RIGHT would align me over the enemy x-column (x=6) \u2014 aggressive and tempting, but it nudges toward risky head-on possibilities later while I\u2019m behind on apples.\n- DOWN pulls me straight toward the center/bottom, preserving multiple escape routes (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN on the next turn) and starts the vertical squeeze toward the opponent without forcing an immediate clash. Keeps our options open and still aggressive.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) Drop DOWN now to (5,6) to start descending and threaten to cut the bottom lanes.\n2) Keep lateral space so I can pivot left/right as they commit; avoid forcing simultaneous head collisions while we\u2019re behind.\n3) Grow when safe, then close their exits once they\u2019re funneled into the bottom rows \u2014 only force a head-on when we have the apple lead or a guaranteed survival.\n\nPlay smart, keep them boxed, finish the choke.

So my tail did NOT move away. It stayed. Therefore, moving into (5, 1) is hitting my own body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH (probably).** Let's double check the apple count.

I can go RIGHT to (7, 2) next turn.\n\nBoth paths lead to the apple. However, **RIGHT (7, 1)** gets me closer to the right edge of the board. The enemy is on the left side (x=5). By moving Right, I am claiming the right side of the board. This effectively splits the board in half. If I control the right, he is confined to the left. This is the \"boxing him in\" strategy.\n\nAlso, from (7, 1), I have an escape route to (8, 1) or (7, 0) if needed. From (6, 2), I have (7, 2) or (6, 3).\n\nLet's go **RIGHT**. I need to secure that right side territory. The apple at (7, 2) is sitting right there waiting for me.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the right side.

My body is trailing behind me: [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. The enemy snake #0 is hanging out at (5, 5) with a body at (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7).\n\nLet's analyze my potential moves from (7, 1):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 2):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (7, 2) is an `A` (Apple)! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety:** Is it safe? The enemy head is at (5, 5). He can move to (5, 4), (6, 5), (4, 5), or (5, 6). None of those are (7, 2).\n    *   **Collision:** If I go UP to (7, 2), does anyone else go there? The enemy is far away. No one else is near.\n    *   **Growth:** I eat the apple! I grow to 6 apples. Score becomes 6-3.\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE & REWARDING.**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (8, 1) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls and bodies.\n    *   **Strategy:** This pushes me further right, claiming territory. But I miss the apple at (7, 2) right now.\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (6, 1) is `T` (My body).\n    *   **Safety:** Wait, my body is at (6, 1). If I move LEFT into (6, 1), I am moving into my own body segment. That's death. **DO NOT GO LEFT.**\n    *   *Wait, let's double check the body list.* Head (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 0)...\n    *   Yes, (6, 1) is occupied by my neck. Moving into your neck is death.\n    *   **Status:** **DEATH.**\n\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 0):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (7, 0) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving to the bottom wall. Limits upward mobility. I miss the apple.\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nBetween UP, RIGHT, and DOWN, **UP** is the clear winner. Why?\n*   **Content:** I get an apple! +1 Score. Growth is dominance.\n*   **Positioning:** (7, 2) is a great spot. It's central-right. From there, I can access (8, 2), (6, 2), (7, 3), or (7, 1) (which will be open next turn as my tail moves).\n*   **Enemy:** The enemy is at (5, 5). He is not threatening my path. If he moves aggressively towards me, I will have grown and have more options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 2). Secure the right side of the board (columns 7, 8, 9). Force the enemy into the left side. Once I have the territory, I can turn left and hunt him down. Keep the pressure on!\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going for the apple. UP!\n\nUP",

I just ate the apple on Turn 8, so my tail hasn't moved yet. My body is currently: [(7, 2) Head, (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)].\n\nOpponent snake #0 is at **(6, 5)**. He has 4 apples. We have 6. We are winning. We need to box him in and force a crash.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (7, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Board State:** The map shows `(7, 3)` is an **Apple (A)**. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety:** Is it safe? My body is behind me. The enemy is at (6, 5). He is currently at a safe distance. If he moves UP to (6, 6) or RIGHT to (7, 5), he is nowhere near (7, 3).\n    *   **Pros:** I eat an apple. I grow to 7. Score 7-4.\n    *   **Cons:** None immediately visible.\n    *   **VERDICT:** **VERY GOOD.**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Board State:** (8, 2) is Empty (`.`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Claims the right edge.\n    *   **Comparison:** Why go to an empty square when there is an apple right above me? I can always go right later.\n    *   **VERDICT:** Good, but **UP** is better.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 1):**\n    *   **Board State:** (7, 1) is my body.\n    *   **Safety:** DEATH. I cannot move into my own body.\n    *   **VERDICT:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Board State:** (6, 2) is Empty (`.`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me closer to the center.\n    *   **Comparison:** Missing the apple at (7, 3). I need to keep my lead.\n    *   **VERDICT:** Okay, but **UP** is better.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI am taking the apple at (7, 3). I need to extend my lead to 7-4. Once I eat, my tail will eventually clear up (6, 1) and (7, 1), opening up more space. The enemy is stuck in the left center. I will dominate the right side and force him into a corner.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going for the content. UP!\n\nUP",

No. We want to box him, not trade skulls. \ud83d\ude09\n- The opponent is low (y=2) and already constrained by his own body and the bottom area.

Let's analyze the board and secure the W! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head is at **(7, 3)** (just ate the apple, so I'm still at 6 apples).\n- Opponent (Snake #0) is at **(6, 4)** with 4 apples.\n- Board is 10x10.\n- Apples are scattered. My priority is to grow and box in the opponent.\n\n**2) EVALUATING MY OPTIONS FROM (7, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Board State:** Map shows `(7, 4)` is **Empty (`.`)**.\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   Is it on the board? Yes (7, 4).\n        *   Is it my body? No. My body is at (7, 2), (7, 1), etc.\n        *   Is it enemy body? No. Enemy body is at (6, 5), (5, 5), etc.\n        *   Is it enemy head? No. Enemy head is at (6, 4).\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me away from the immediate apple I just ate (7, 3 is now empty because I ate it) and towards the center/top. It keeps me alive and away from the opponent.\n    *   **Future:** From (7, 4), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Good options.\n\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   **Board State:** `(7, 2)` is my **Body**.\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH**. I would hit myself.\n    *   **VERDICT:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Board State:** `(6, 3)` is **Empty (`.`)**.\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   On board? Yes.\n        *   My body? No.\n        *   Enemy body? No.\n        *   Enemy head? No (Head is at 6, 4).\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me left. However, the opponent is at (6, 4). If I go LEFT to (6, 3) and he goes DOWN to (6, 3), we collide. Or if he goes LEFT to (5, 4) and I go UP to (6, 4) next turn... it's risky to get close to his head.\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving closer to the opponent is dangerous. I want to box him in, not risk a head-on collision when I have the score lead (6 vs 4).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Board State:** `(8, 3)` is an **Apple (`A`)**! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   On board? Yes.\n        *   My body? No.\n        *   Enemy body? No.\n        *   Enemy head? No.\n    *   **Strategy:** I EAT THE APPLE! I grow to 7 apples. Score becomes 7-4.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** Is the opponent at (8, 4)? No, he is at (6, 4). Is he at (8, 3)? No.\n    *   **Comparison:** Eating is good. It extends my lead. Moving UP (to 7,4) is safe but doesn't gain points. Moving LEFT risks proximity to the opponent.\n\n**3) THE PLAN:**\nThe opponent is stuck in the bottom-left quadrant (around x=5, y=5). I am on the right side. I need to push him into a corner. Taking the apple at (8, 3) gives me more length and keeps me on the right edge, dominating the board. I will avoid moving directly toward him to prevent a suicide collision.\n\n**4) FINAL DECISION:**\nUP to (7, 4) is safe but passive.\nRIGHT to (8, 3) is safe, gains a point, and keeps me on the right flank.\nLEFT to (6, 3) is risky due to proximity to enemy head.\nDOWN is death.\n\nI'm taking the apple. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

We're live and the heat is on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down for the WIN!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (8, 3) - I'm sitting pretty on the right side. \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)] - I'm long and leaning towards the bottom-left, but my head is on the right.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #0):** Head (5, 4), Body [(6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)].\n*   **The Board:** It's tight down there! The opponent is trapped in a box defined by the T's (walls) and the apple drops. Look at that shape: he's got walls at (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5) and (6, 4). He's basically contained in that lower right quadrant of the left side.\n*   **Score:** 7 to 5. I'm winning. \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**2) EVALUATING MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** Looks like a `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** No walls. No body. Enemy is at (5, 4) \u2014 that's 3 units away. Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me up the right edge. Keeps me safe. Good for maintaining distance.\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** Looks like a `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** No walls. No body. Enemy is far away. Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me down the right edge. Good option.\n\n*   **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** This is my **BODY**. I just left this spot in the last turn!\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH**. \ud83d\udc80 I hit myself.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** Looks like a `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** No walls (x=9 is valid). No body. Enemy is far.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the far corner. This is a solid \"tucking in\" move.\n\n**3) THE STRATEGY & THE PLAN:**\n\"Box him in and make him crash out!!\"\n\nThe opponent is currently trapped. He has walls (T) surrounding him on multiple sides. If I push him, he has limited moves. Specifically, look at his position:\n*   (5, 4) is his head.\n*   (6, 4) is his body to the right.\n*   (5, 5) is his body above.\n*   (4, 5) is a wall.\n*   (5, 6) is his body further up.\n*   (6, 5) is his body.\n\nHe is squeezed. He can likely go DOWN to (5, 3) or UP to (5, 5) (but wait, (5, 5) is his *own body*!).\nActually, looking closely at the board:\n*   (5, 4) is Head.\n*   (6, 4) is Body.\n*   (5, 5) is Body.\n*   (4, 5) is Wall (T).\n*   (3, 5) is Empty (A? No, A is at 3,4).\n*   (5, 3) is Empty.\n\nHe is likely going to move DOWN to (5, 3) to survive, or LEFT to (4, 4).\nIf he moves DOWN to (5, 3), he is exposing himself to the bottom open area.\nIf he moves LEFT to (4, 4), he might get pinned.\n\n**My Move:**\nI need to secure the win. I'm already winning 7-5. I don't need to risk a head-on collision right now unless I'm sure I win (I have +2 score, so I *would* win a double KO, but why risk it?).\nMy body is at (7, 3). If I go **UP** or **DOWN**, I leave a gap behind me on the right side.\n**LEFT** is death (into my own body at 7,3).\n**RIGHT** to (9, 3) puts me in the corner. It's safe. It consolidates my position.\n**UP** to (8, 4) is also safe and keeps me mobile.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state, there is an Apple at **(9, 9)**. If I go RIGHT now, I'm moving *away* from the center/top apples. If I go UP, I'm moving towards the center/top cluster.\n\nWait, look at the Apple list: `(9, 9)`, `(0, 6)`, `(3, 1)`, `(9, 6)`.\nThere are apples on the top right corner `(9, 9)` and `(9, 6)`.\nMy head is at `(8, 3)`.\nIf I go **UP** to `(8, 4)`, I am moving towards `(9, 6)` and `(9, 9)`.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(9, 3)`, I am tucked in the corner but can still move up later.\n\n**The Aggressive Play:**\nThe opponent is trapped on the left. I want to dominate the board. Moving **UP** allows me to sweep the right side and potentially cut off the opponent if he tries to cross over later (though he's pretty stuck right now).\nAlso, by moving **UP**, I avoid the risk of trapping myself in the bottom-right corner (9,0)-(9,3) if I go Right/Down.\n\nLet's look at the specific board again for safety.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nMy head is at (8,3). The `T` is at (8,2)? No, looking at the map coordinates:\n`3 . . . . . . . . T 1`\nThis line corresponds to Y=3.\nColumns: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nAt Y=3:\nCol 8 is `T` (Wall).\nCol 9 is `1` (Me).\n\nWait, let's re-read the ASCII map carefully.\nThe map is rotated 90 degrees visually or I'm misinterpreting the grid.\n`9 A . . . . A . . . A` (Top row, Y=9)\n...\n`0 A . . . T T T . A .` (Bottom row, Y=0)\n`  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` (X coordinates)\n\nMy head is at (8, 3).\nLet's check the cell (9, 3).\nColumn 9, Row 3.\nRow 3 is: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nSpace 8 is `T` (Wall).\nSpace 9 is `1` (My head).\n\nWait, the map shows:\n`3 . . . . . . . . T 1`\nIndexing this string:\n0: `.` (x=0)\n1: `.` (x=1)\n2: `.` (x=2)\n3: `.` (x=3)\n4: `.` (x=4)\n5: `.` (x=5)\n6: `.` (x=6)\n7: `.` (x=7)\n8: `T` (x=8)\n9: `1` (x=9)\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nMy head is at (8, 3). The map shows `(8, 3)` is **NOT** an apple. The map shows `(8, 3)` is a `T` (Wall) relative to the grid? No, the map shows the `1` is at the last position of the row string.\nWait, the `1` in the map represents my head.\nThe string is `3 . . . . . . . . T 1`.\nThis represents row Y=3.\nThe last character `1` is at the end of the string.\nThe coordinate label at the bottom is `9`.\nSo `1` is at X=9, Y=3.\nThe character before `1` is `T` at X=8, Y=3.\n\n**CONFIRMING COORDINATES:**\nRow 3 string: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nValues: . . . . . . . . T 1\n\n*   My Head (8, 3): X=8, Y=3. According to the map, cell (8, 3) contains `T`. **A WALL.**\n*   My Head (9, 3): X=9, Y=3. According to the map, cell (9, 3) contains `1`. **MY HEAD.**\n\n**PROBLEM:**\nThe prompt says: `Head: (8, 3)`.\nThe map says: `(8, 3)` is a Wall (`T`).\nThis means the map provided is either outdated (after my move) or there is a collision/conflict.\nHowever, the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says I moved RIGHT.\nIf I was at (7, 3) and moved RIGHT, I went to (8, 3).\nThe map shows `(8, 3)` as `T`.\n\nLet's look at the \"BOARD STATE\" again.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nRow 4: `. A . A . 0 T . . .`\nRow 5: `. . . . . T T . . .`\n\nIf I am at (8, 3) and it's a Wall, I shouldn't be able to be there.\nBut the `1` is at the very end of the string.\nThe string length is 11 characters (index 0 to 10?). No, 0-9.\nWait, `3 . . . . . . . . T 1`\nCount the spaces:\nY=3 row: `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `1`\nCoordinates:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: 1\n\n**THE MAP IS THE CURRENT STATE.**\nMy prompt says: `Head: (8, 3)`.\nThe map says: `(8, 3)` is a Wall.\nThis implies that either:\n1. I died moving into a wall (impossible, I'm here).\n2. The `T` represents something else, or I'm misreading the map.\n3. The map coordinates are X=0..9 (left to right) and Y=0..9 (bottom to top).\n4. The `1` represents the head. The `T` is at x=8.\n5. My head is at (8, 3). The map shows `T` at (8, 3). This is a contradiction.\n\n**WAIT.**\nLook at the map again.\n`3 . . . . . . . . T 1`\nThis is row Y=3.\nThe last character `1` is at X=9.\nThe second to last character `T` is at X=8.\nThe prompt says my head is at (8, 3).\nIf the map is correct, (8, 3) is `T` (Wall).\nIf the prompt is correct, I am at (8, 3).\nIf I am at (8, 3) and the map says `T`, there is a conflict.\nHowever, the prompt is the \"source of truth\" for my state, but the map is the visual representation.\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:**\nThe map is slightly misaligned or the `T` is not actually at (8,3).\nOr, more likely, I am at (9, 3) and the prompt's coordinate (8, 3) is from the *start* of the turn?\nNo, the prompt says: `Head: (8, 3)` under \"YOUR SNAKE\".\nAnd `--YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):--` shows `RIGHT`.\nIf I was at (7, 3) and moved `RIGHT`, I am at (8, 3).\n\nLet's look at the `T` placement in the map.\nRow 3: `T` is at the second to last position.\nRow 4: `T` is at the 7th position (index 7).\nRow 5: `T` is at index 5 and 6.\nRow 6: `T` is at index 5.\nRow 7: `T` is at index 5.\nRow 1: `T` is at index 5 and 6.\nRow 0: `T` is at index 5, 6, 7.\n\nIt looks like there is a vertical wall of `T`s at X=5, X=6, X=7?\nNo, X=5,6,7 have `T`s in rows 0,1,5,6,7,4.\nX=8 has `T`s in rows 3, 4? (Row 4 has `T` at index 7, so X=7?).\n\nLet's re-examine the Row 3 string: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIf `T` is at index 8, then X=8 is a wall.\nIf `1` is at index 9, then X=9 is my head.\n**BUT THE PROMPT SAYS MY HEAD IS AT (8, 3).**\n\nIs it possible the prompt's coordinate `(8, 3)` is *before* the move description?\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK ... RIGHT ... END LAST MOVE PICK\"\n\"START LAST RATIONALE ... My head is at (7, 3) (just ate the apple)... RIGHT ... END LAST RATIONALE\"\n\nOkay, the prompt explicitly states:\n`YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):`\n`- Head: (8, 3)`\n`- Body: [(7, 3), ...]`\n\nThis means I am currently occupying (8, 3).\nThe map shows `(8, 3)` is a `T`.\nUnless `T` is not a wall? The instructions say: `T` usually denotes a wall in these types of game prompts, or a \"Trap\"? No, the prompt doesn't define `T`.\nBut `A` is Apple, `.` is Empty, numbers are snake IDs.\nWhat is `T`?\nThe prompt says: \"BOARD STATE: ... T ...\". It doesn't define T.\nHowever, usually `T` is Wall/Trap.\nIf I am at (8, 3) and it's a Wall, I am dead.\nBut I am making a move, so I am alive.\n\n**Maybe the map is just a visual approximation and the coordinates are the ground truth?**\nYes, I must trust the coordinates provided in the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section over the ASCII map if there's a conflict, because the ASCII map is a visual representation which can sometimes be offset or ambiguous.\n\n**However, looking closely at the map again:**\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIf the coordinate labels at the bottom `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` align with the characters above.\nThen `T` is at X=8, Y=3. `1` is at X=9, Y=3.\nIf I am at (8, 3), I am inside the `T`.\nIf I am at (9, 3), I am the `1`.\n\nIs it possible the prompt's coordinates are 0-indexed but the map is 1-indexed or vice versa? No, the prompt says `Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right`.\n\n**Let's assume the Prompt Text is the absolute truth and the Map is a visual guide.**\nThe Prompt Text says I am at (8, 3). I must act as if (8, 3) is my head.\nBut if I move, I need to know where I can go.\nIf I am at (8, 3), and I look at the map to see neighbors:\n- (8, 4) (Up): Row 4 string: `. A . A . 0 T . . .` (Index 8 is `.`).\n- (8, 2) (Down): Row 2 string: `. . . . . . . . T .` (Index 8 is `T`).\n- (7, 3) (Left): Row 3 string: Index 7 is `.`.\n- (9, 3) (Right): Row 3 string: Index 9 is `1` (Me).\n\nWait, if I am at (8, 3)...\nUp (8, 4): Map shows `.` (Empty).\nDown (8, 2): Map shows `T` (Wall/Trap).\nLeft (7, 3): Map shows `.` (Empty).\nRight (9, 3): Map shows `1` (My body? No, my head is at 8,3. This must be an artifact of the map showing my head at 9,3).\n\n**Let's reconsider the Map vs Prompt conflict.**\nIf the map shows `1` at X=9, Y=3.\nAnd the prompt says Head is at X=8, Y=3.\nThen the map is showing my head one unit to the RIGHT of where the prompt says it is.\nThis is a common \"visual offset\" error in LLM prompts or game rendering.\n**OR**, the `T` at X=8, Y=3 is actually my body?\nNo, my body is listed as `[(7, 3), (7, 2)...]`.\n\n**Scenario A: I trust the coordinates explicitly given.**\nI am at (8, 3).\nMy moves:\n- UP (8, 4): Map shows `.`. Safe.\n- DOWN (8, 2): Map shows `T`. Likely Wall/Death.\n- LEFT (7, 3): My Body. Death.\n- RIGHT (9, 3): Map shows `1`. I am already at (8, 3). If I move RIGHT, I go to (9, 3). If the map says `1` is at (9, 3), it's confusing.\n\n**Let's look at the `1` again.**\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nThis `1` is the *last character*.\nIf X=9 is the last coordinate.\nThen `1` is at X=9, Y=3.\nThis means my head is at (9, 3).\nBut the prompt says (8, 3).\n\n**Let's look at the `0` (Opponent).**\nRow 4: `. A . A . 0 T . . .`\nIndex 5 is `0`.\nSo Opponent is at (5, 4).\nPrompt says: `Head: (5, 4)`.\n**MATCH.** Prompt and Map match for the opponent.\n\n**Let's look at my body.**\nPrompt: `Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`\nCheck Map:\n- (7, 3): Row 3, Index 7 is `.`. (My body is not drawn? Or I'm invisible?)\n- (7, 2): Row 2, Index 7 is `.`.\n- (7, 1): Row 1, Index 7 is `T`.\n- (6, 1): Row 1, Index 6 is `T`.\n- (6, 0): Row 0, Index 6 is `T`.\n- (5, 0): Row 0, Index 5 is `T`.\n- (4, 0): Row 0, Index 4 is `T`.\n\n**MAJOR REALIZATION:**\nThe map shows `T` (Traps/Walls) ALL OVER the place where my body is supposed to be.\nRow 0: `A . . . T T T . A .`\nRow 1: `. . A A . . T T . .`\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . T .`\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nRow 4: `. A . A . 0 T . . .`\nRow 5: `. . . . . T T . . .`\nRow 6: `A . A . . T . A . A`\n\n**IT LOOKS LIKE THE `T`s ARE PART OF THE MAP TERRAIN (WALLS) AND ALSO MY BODY?**\nNo, the prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL\".\nIf I am Snake 1, my body should be marked `1` or implied by the list.\nThe map shows `T`s.\nThe prompt says: \"APPLE DROPS: ... (0, 0) ...\".\nMap (0,0): `A`. Correct.\n\n**Is it possible `T` stands for \"Tail\" or \"Tunnel\"?**\nNo, usually `T` is Wall.\nBut if `T` is my body, why is it `T` and not `1`?\nMaybe the map rendering is broken or `T` is just \"Occupied\".\n\n**Let's look at the specific move I made last turn.**\nLast turn I was at (7, 3). I moved **RIGHT**.\nI arrived at (8, 3).\nThe map shows (8, 3) is `T` (Wall).\nThis implies I hit a wall or the map is showing the *previous* state or the `T` is not a wall.\n\n**What if `T` is just \"Trap\" (dangerous) but not a hard wall?**\nThe rules say: \"Move outside the board? You're DEAD.\" It doesn't mention traps.\nHowever, usually in these prompts, `T` is a hard obstacle.\n\n**Let's look at the map structure.**\nThere is a `T` cluster in the bottom left.\n`0 A . . . T T T . A .`\n`1 . . A A . . T T . .`\n`2 . . . . . . . . T .`\n`3 . . . . . . . . T 1`\n`4 . A . A . 0 T . . .`\n`5 . . . . . T T . . .`\n\nIt looks like a cage or a structure.\nThe opponent `0` is inside this structure at (5, 4).\nThe `T`s form walls around him.\nMy body `1` is also inside this structure (rows 0, 1, 2, 3).\nMy head is at (8, 3) according to prompt.\n(8, 3) is on the *right* side of this structure.\nThe `T` at (8, 3) is likely a wall of the structure.\nBut the prompt says I am at (8, 3).\n\n**Hypothesis: The Map is correct and the Prompt's coordinate (8, 3) is a typo or refers to something else?**\nIf the map is correct, my head is the `1` at (9, 3).\nWhy would the prompt say (8, 3)?\nMaybe my head is actually at (8, 3) and the map is shifted?\nLook at Row 4: `. A . A . 0 T . . .`\nOpponent `0` is at (5, 4).\nMap index 5 is `0`.\nPrompt says (5, 4).\nMap and Prompt agree for opponent.\n\n**What if the `T` at (8, 3) is actually my tail or body, and the `1` at (9, 3) is my head?**\nPrompt Body: `[(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`\n(7, 3) is my neck.\n(8, 3) is where I *should* be if I moved RIGHT from (7, 3).\n(9, 3) is where the `1` is drawn.\n\n**There is a discrepancy between the Prompt Text and the Map Visual.**\nI must trust the Prompt Text for decision making because it contains the exact coordinates.\nBUT, to plan my move, I need to know what is adjacent to me.\nIf I trust the Prompt Text:\nHead: (8, 3).\nLook at Map for neighbors:\n- Up (8, 4): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n- Down (8, 2): Map shows `T` (Wall).\n- Left (7, 3): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n- Right (9, 3): Map shows `1` (Me? Or empty space?).\n\n**If I trust the Map Visual:**\nHead: (9, 3) (Where the `1` is).\nLook at Map for neighbors:\n- Up (9, 4): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n- Down (9, 2): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n- Left (8, 3): Map shows `T` (Wall).\n- Right (10, 3): Off board.\n\n**Let's assume the Map is the definitive visual representation of the current turn's board state.**\nWhy?\nBecause the map shows `T`s that match the structure described in the prompt's \"Box him in\" narrative.\nThe `T`s form a cage around the opponent `0`.\nThe `T`s also seem to form a wall on the right side of the board at (8, 3).\nIf I am Snake 1, and I am winning, I am likely positioned outside the cage or controlling the cage.\nThe map shows `1` at (9, 3).\nIf I am at (9, 3), I am in the far right corner.\nFrom (9, 3), looking at the map:\n- Up (9, 4): `.` (Safe).\n- Down (9, 2): `.` (Safe).\n- Left (8, 3): `T` (Wall).\n- Right: Off board (Death).\n\nSo from (9, 3), I can only go UP or DOWN.\nIf I am at (8, 3) (Prompt Text):\n- Up (8, 4): `.` (Safe).\n- Down (8, 2): `T` (Death).\n- Left (7, 3): `.` (Safe).\n- Right (9, 3): `1` (My body? Or empty?).\n\n**Let's verify the \"Box him in\" strategy.**\nThe opponent is at (5, 4).\nHe is surrounded by `T`s.\nIf I am Snake 1, I want to prevent him from escaping.\nWhere are the exits?\nLook at the `T` walls in rows 4, 5, 6.\nRow 4: `. A . A . 0 T . . .`\nThe `T` is at (6, 4). That's the body of snake 0.\nWait, the opponent's body is `[(6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)]`.\nSo (6, 4) is the opponent's neck.\nThe `T` at (6, 4) in the map corresponds to the opponent's body?\nNo, the map shows `0` at (5, 4) and `T` at (6, 4).\nThe prompt says opponent body at (6, 4).\n**So `T` in the map represents the opponent's body?**\nOr the opponent's body is marked as `T`?\nBut the prompt says `Snake #0 - Head: (5, 4), Body: [(6, 4)...]`.\nThe map shows `0` at (5, 4).\nThe map shows `T` at (6, 4).\nIf `T` is the opponent's body, then `T` = Snake Body.\nBut there are `T`s everywhere.\nRow 0: `T T T`.\nRow 1: `T T`.\nRow 2: `T`.\nRow 3: `T`.\nRow 5: `T T`.\nRow 6: `T`.\n\n**Is `T` the terrain AND the snake body?**\nUsually, `T` is a Wall.\nBut the opponent's body is listed as `(6, 4), (6, 5)...`.\nMap (6, 4): `T`. Map (6, 5): `T`.\nMap (5, 5): `T`. Map (5, 6): `T`. Map (5, 7): `T`.\n**AHA!**\nThe opponent's body is EXACTLY where the `T`s are on the map!\nSo `T` represents the opponent's body (Snake #0)!\nAnd `1` represents my body/head.\n\n**So, the map shows:**\n- `0`: Opponent Head.\n- `T`: Opponent Body.\n- `1`: My Head (and maybe body, but only head is shown as `1`).\n- `.`: Empty.\n- `A`: Apple.\n\n**What about my body?**\nMy body is `[(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`.\nLet's check the map for these coordinates:\n(7, 3): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n(7, 2): Map shows `.` (Empty).\n(7, 1): Map shows `T` (Opponent body? Or my body?).\nWait, my body at (7, 1). Map (7, 1) is `T`.\nMy body at (6, 1). Map (6, 1) is `T`.\nMy body at (6, 0). Map (6, 0) is `T`.\nMy body at (5, 0). Map (5, 0) is `T`.\nMy body at (4, 0). Map (4, 0) is `T`.\n\n**CONFLICT:**\nThe `T`s at (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0) match my body coordinates.\nThe `T`s at (6, 4), (5, 5), etc. match opponent body coordinates.\n**So `T` represents ANY snake body?**\nOr specifically \"Obstacle\".\nIf `T` is any body, then:\nMy body is `T`.\nOpponent body is `T`.\nThe map shows `T`s.\n\n**If `T` is a body (mine or opponent's), then:**\nI cannot move into `T`.\nI cannot move into `0` (Opponent Head).\nI cannot move into `1` (My Head).\n\n**Let's re-evaluate my position.**\nPrompt: `Head: (8, 3)`.\nMap (8, 3): Row 3 string: `. . . . . . . .

Opponent is far, so likely Wall).\nI CANNOT move to (9, 3) (Map says `1`, which is my head currently, but if I move there it's empty? No, `1` is my head).\n\n**Let's assume the Map is accurate for Open Spaces (`.`) and Apples (`A`), and maybe the `T`s are mostly obstacles.**\nIf (7, 3) is `.` on the map, but the prompt says it's my body.\nThere is a discrepancy.\nIf I trust the map for *obstacles* and the prompt for *my location*:\nMy head is at (8, 3).\nI know (7, 3) is my body (from prompt).\nI know (7, 2) is my body.\nI know (8, 2) is a Wall (`T` on map, not adjacent to opponent).\nI know (9, 3) is `1` (My head visually on map, but coordinate says 8,3).\n\n**Let's look at the `1` on the map again.**\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIf `1` is at index 9.\nIf my head is at (8, 3) (index 8).\nThen the map shows `T` at index 8 (my head) and `1` at index 9 (empty space?).\nThis is inverted.\nUsually, `1` should be at my head.\nIf my head is at (8, 3), `1` should be at (8, 3).\nThe map shows `T` at (8, 3).\nThis suggests (8, 3) is a Wall.\nBut I am there.\n\n**Possibility: The \"Board State\" ASCII art is shifted or misaligned.**\nLook at the columns.\nThe bottom row of numbers is `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.\nThe row above is `0 A . . .

No.\nSo (8, 2) is a Wall.\nAnd (8, 3) is `T` on the map.\nIf (8, 3) is a Wall, and I am there, something is wrong.\nOR, `T` at (8, 3) is just a visual artifact of the `1` being drawn there.\nMaybe the `1` overlaps the `T`?\nNo, the string is `. . . . . . . . T 1`.\nThere are 10 characters.\nIf `1` is the 10th character (index 9), then `T` is the 9th (index 8).\nThey are distinct.\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:**\nI am actually at (9, 3).\nThe prompt says (8, 3) by mistake or due to 0-based vs 1-based confusion?\nNo, `(0,0)` to `(9,9)`.\nIf I am at (9, 3):\n- Up (9, 4): `.` (Safe).\n- Down (9, 2): `.` (Safe).\n- Left (8, 3): `T` (Wall/Body).\n- Right: Off board.\n\n**If I am at (8, 3):**\n- Up (8, 4): `.` (Safe).\n- Down (8, 2): `T` (Wall).\n- Left (7, 3): `.` (Safe).\n- Right (9, 3): `1` (My body? No, if I move right I go to 9,3).\n\n**Let's check the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" again.**\n`RIGHT`\nIf I was at (7, 3) and moved RIGHT, I arrive at (8, 3).\nIf (8, 3) is a Wall (`T`), I should have died.\nUnless `T` is just \"Trap\" (damage) not \"Wall\" (death).\nBut the rules say \"Move outside board? Dead\". No mention of traps.\nUsually `T` is Wall.\n\n**Maybe the Map is from *before* my move?**\nThe \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" shows I moved RIGHT.\nThe \"BOARD STATE\" is the current state *after* the move?\nIf so, and I moved into (8, 3), and (8, 3) is now `T`, that means I turned into a wall?\nAbsurd.\n\n**Let's trust the Prompt's text for MY body coordinates.**\nMy body: `[(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`.\nI cannot move into these coordinates.\n(7, 3) is to my LEFT.\n(7, 2) is DOWN-LEFT.\n(8, 2) is DOWN. Map says `T`. If `T` is not my body, and not opponent body, it's a Wall. So DOWN is illegal.\n(9, 3) is RIGHT. Map says `1`. If `1` is my head, and I am at (8, 3), then (9, 3) is empty? Or is (9, 3) a wall?\nWait, if the map is static and represents *obstacles*, then `1` is just \"Me\".\nIf I am at (8, 3), then (9, 3) is just a coordinate.\nIf the map shows `T` at (8, 3), and I am there, the map is wrong about the content of (8, 3).\nHowever, the map is reliable for (8, 4), (9, 3), etc.\n\n**Let's look at the map again.**\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIf `1` is my head.\nThen `1` is at (9, 3).\nThen `T` is at (8, 3).\nIf I am at (9, 3), then (8, 3) is Left.\nLeft is `T` (Wall).\nUp is `.` (Safe).\nDown is `.` (Safe).\nRight is off board.\n\n**If the prompt says (8, 3) and map says `1` is at (9, 3).**\nMaybe I moved RIGHT to (8, 3), and the map shows `1` at (9, 3) because it's an old map?\nBut the opponent `0` matches coordinates.\nEverything matches *except* my head coordinate relative to the `1` symbol.\n\n**Is it possible `1` is not my head, but just a \"feature\" and my head is the `T`?**\nNo, `1` usually denotes the snake ID.\n\n**Let's assume the map is correct and I am at (9, 3).**\nWhy would the prompt say (8, 3)?\nMaybe the prompt's coordinates are from the *start* of the turn?\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK: RIGHT\"\nIf I started at (7, 3) and moved RIGHT, I am now at (8, 3).\nIf the board state is shown *after* the move, I should be at (8, 3).\nIf the board state shows `1` at (9, 3), maybe I actually moved to (9, 3)?\nNo, (7, 3) -> (8, 3).\n\n**Let's look at the `T` at (8, 3) again.**\nRow 3 string: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIt is possible that the `T` represents a \"Trail\" or \"Decoy\" or just \"Wall\".\nAnd the `1` represents the Head.\nIf the prompt says Head is at (8, 3), and the map shows `1` at (9, 3), there is a mismatch.\nIf I ignore the `1` and look at the `T` at (8, 3).\nIf I am at (8, 3), and (8, 3) is `T`.\nAnd `T` is an obstacle (based on the cage structure).\nThen I am inside a wall.\nThis is impossible.\n\n**THEREFORE: The Prompt's coordinate `(8, 3)` is likely correct, and the Map's `1` at `(9, 3)` is a visual offset or error.**\nBUT, the `T` at `(8, 3)` is the problem.\nIf the map says `(8, 3)` is `T`, and `T` is Obstacle, I can't be there.\n**Unless `T` at (8, 3) is actually my body?**\nMy body list: `[(7, 3), ...]`. (7, 3) is my neck.\n(8, 3) is my head.\n(7, 3) is `.` on the map.\nThis is a mess.\n\n**Let's try to find a safe move based on what is DEFINITELY true.**\n1. My head is at `(X, 3)` where X is either 8 or 9.\n2. My body occupies `(7, 3)`, `(7, 2)`, `(7, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 0)`, `(5, 0)`, `(4, 0)`.\n3. The opponent is at `(5, 4)` with body nearby.\n4. The map shows `T`s forming a cage.\n\n**If I am at (8, 3) (Prompt says so):**\n- UP (8, 4): Map says `.` (Empty). Safe.\n- DOWN (8, 2): Map says `T`. Not my body. Not opponent body. Must be Wall/Trap. UNSAFE.\n- LEFT (7, 3): My Body. UNSAFE.\n- RIGHT (9, 3): Map says `1`. If `1` is my visual rep, then (9, 3) is empty space? Or occupied?\n   If I am at (8, 3), and I move RIGHT, I go to (9, 3).\n   If (9, 3) is `1` on the map, and `1` represents *me*, then (9, 3) is empty (since I haven't arrived yet, or the `1` is a placeholder).\n   However, usually `1` means \"occupied by snake 1\".\n   If I move to (9, 3), I am safe from walls.\n   But if `1` means \"My body\", then I am moving into my own body?\n   No, my body is at (7, 3).\n   So (9, 3) is empty.\n\n**Let's check (9, 3) again.**\nIf the map shows `1` at (9, 3), and my head is at (8, 3), then the `1` represents my head *position*.\nIf the map is drawn with the head at (9, 3), and the text says (8, 3), I should trust the text.\nBUT, if the map says `T` at (8, 3), and I am at (8, 3), then (8, 3) is occupied by me.\nThe `T` on the map might be covering my head?\nNo, the string shows `T` then `1`.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI will assume the Prompt Text is the ground truth for coordinates.\nMy head is at (8, 3).\nMy body is at (7, 3), etc.\nThe Map is a visual guide where `T` = Obstacle (Wall or Snake Body).\nI must check neighbors of (8, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 4):**\n    *   Map: Row 4 (`. A . A . 0 T . . .`) Index 8 is `.`.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it opponent body? No.\n    *   Is it Wall? No (it's `.`).\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (8, 2):**\n    *   Map: Row 2 (`. . . . . . . . T .`) Index 8 is `T`.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it opponent body? No.\n    *   Is it Wall? Yes (`T`).\n    *   **Result: UNSAFE (Wall).**\n\n3.  **LEFT (7, 3):**\n    *   Map: Row 3 Index 7 is `.`.\n    *   Is it my body? **YES** (List says (7, 3) is my body).\n    *   **Result: UNSAFE (Self collision).**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 3):**\n    *   Map: Row 3 Index 9 is `1`.\n    *   Is it my body? My body is at (7, 3)... (not 9, 3).\n    *   Is it opponent body? No.\n    *   Is it Wall? Map shows `1`, usually not a wall.\n    *   **Result: Likely SAFE.** (The `1` is just a visual representation of \"Me\", but since I am at (8, 3), the cell (9, 3) is empty).\n\n**So my safe moves are UP and RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **UP (8, 4):**\n    *   Moves me towards the center/top.\n    *   Keeps me away from the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Opens up paths to (9, 6) apple and (9, 9) apple.\n    *   Avoids the \"T\" at (8, 2).\n*   **RIGHT (9, 3):**\n    *   Moves me to the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Puts me against the wall.\n    *   From (9, 3), I can only go UP or DOWN.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (9, 2) (Empty), I am safe.\n    *   If I go UP to (9, 4) (Empty), I am safe.\n\n**Which is better?**\nI want to dominate the board. The opponent is trapped in the bottom-left (effectively).\nIf I go **UP**, I sweep the right side and center.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I tuck into the corner.\nGoing **UP** is generally more active and gives more options.\nGoing **RIGHT** restricts my movement to the edge.\n\nHowever, look at the Apple list:\n`(9, 9), (0, 6), (3, 1), (9, 6) ...`\nThere are apples at (9, 9) and (9, 6).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (9, 3), I am positioned directly below the right-side column of apples.\nFrom (9, 3):\n- (9, 4): Empty.\n- (9, 5): Empty.\n- (9, 6): Apple.\n- (9, 7): Empty.\n- (9, 8): Empty.\n- (9, 9): Apple.\n\nGoing **RIGHT** aligns me perfectly with the vertical column of apples on the right edge.\nGoing **UP** puts me at (8, 4), which is adjacent to the column but not in it.\n\n**Aggressive Play:**\nThe opponent is trapped. I have +2 score. I should secure food.\nThe right edge is free of obstacles (except the floor/wall).\nI should move **RIGHT** to claim that column.\n\nWait, let's check the map for (9, 4) to ( (9, 9).\nRow 4: Index 9 is `.`.\nRow 5: Index 9 is `.`.\nRow 6: Index 9 is `A`.\nRow 7: Index 9 is `.`.\nRow 8: Index 9 is `A`? No, row 8 is `8 . . . . . . . . A .`. Index 9 is `.`.\nRow 9: Index 9 is `A`.\n\nSo the right column is clear.\nMoving **RIGHT** is the play to dominate the right side.\n\n**Wait, is there a trap at (9, 3)?**\nMap shows `1` at (9, 3).\nIf `1` is my head, and I am at (8, 3), then (9, 3) is empty.\nIf `1` is a Wall (unlikely), then I can't go there.\nBut `1` is Snake ID.\nSo (9, 3) is empty.\n\n**Final check:**\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (9, 3).\nIf the opponent moves, he is stuck in the cage.\nHe cannot reach me on the right side.\nI will be safe.\n\n**One nuance:**\nIf I am at (8, 3) and I move RIGHT to (9, 3).\nMy tail will move from (4, 0) to (4, 1) or something? No, I didn't eat an apple this turn (I ate one last turn).\nSo my tail moves forward.\nMy body becomes `[(8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), ...]`.\nWait, (7, 3) is currently my neck.\nIf I move RIGHT, (7, 3) becomes my neck? No, (8, 3) becomes my neck.\nWait, my body list is `[(7, 3), (7, 2)...]`.\nIf I move to (9, 3):\nNew Head: (9, 3).\nNew Body: `[(8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0)]`.\n(4, 0) drops off.\n(4, 0) is `T` on the map.\nIf (4, 0) is a Wall, and my tail leaves it, it's fine.\n\n**Is there any reason to go UP instead of RIGHT?**\nGoing UP (8, 4) is safe.\nGoing RIGHT (9, 3) is safe and positions me for the right-side apples.\n\nLet's compare the Apple positions again:\n(9, 9), (9, 6) are on the right.\n(8, 8) is on the right.\n(7, 6) is on the right.\n(5, 9) is top middle.\n(3, 4) is center.\n(2, 7) is top left.\n(0, 9) is top left.\n\nDominating the right side seems lucrative.\nAlso, the opponent is on the left.\nBy going RIGHT, I am maximizing distance between me and the opponent.\nSafety first (well, aggressive safety).\n\n**Let's look at the \"Box him in\" instruction.**\nThe opponent is at (5, 4).\nHe is surrounded by `T`s (his own body and walls).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am leaving him alone to rot in his cage.\nIf I go UP, I am moving closer to him (relative to the right side), but still far.\nActually, (8, 4) is closer to (5, 4) than (9, 3) is? No, distance is roughly the same.\n\n**The decisive factor:**\nThe column of apples on the right side is a \"resource node\".\nI should secure it.\nMoving RIGHT puts me in that column.\nMoving UP puts me adjacent to it.\nI prefer being *in* the column.\n\n**What if the map `1` at (9, 3) means I am ALREADY at (9, 3)?**\nIf the Prompt says (8, 3) and Map says `1` at (9, 3).\nI will trust the Prompt text coordinates for move calculation.\nIf I am at (8, 3), RIGHT is (9, 3).\n\n**One final check on (8, 4) (UP).**\nMap (8, 4) is `.`.\nIs (8, 4) safe long term?\nFrom (8, 4), I can go to (8, 5) (Map `. `), (8, 6) (Map `.`), (8, 7) (Map `.`), (8, 8) (Map `A`).\nAlso (9, 4) is `.`.\nSo (8, 4) is also a great position.\nFrom (8, 4) I can go to (8, 8) Apple.\nFrom (9, 3) I can go to (9, 6) Apple.\n\nBoth are good.\nBut (9, 3) is the corner. Corners are safe if you control them.\n(8, 4) is \"outside\" the corner.\n\nI'll go **RIGHT**. It commits me to the edge, which is a strong defensive position while I maintain my score lead.\n\nWait, look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\".\nI moved RIGHT last time to get to (8, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT again, I am hugging the wall.\nThis is a standard snake strategy.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 3).\nNext turn, move UP to (9, 4).\nThen UP to (9, 5).\nThen eat (9, 6).\nThen eat (9, 9).\n\nLet's double check the map for any dangers at (9, 3).\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . T 1`\nIndex 9 is `1`.\nIf `1` is my head, and I am at (8, 3), then (9, 3) is empty.\nIf `1` is a wall, I can't go there. But `1` is Snake ID 1.\nSo it's empty.\n\nI'm confident.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  **Safety:** UP and RIGHT are safe. LEFT is death (body). DOWN is death (wall).\n2.  **Strategy:** The opponent is trapped on the left. I should secure the right side.\n3.  **Goal:** The right edge has apples at (9, 6) and (9, 9). Moving RIGHT positions me to sweep this column.\n4.  **Aggression:** Maintaining score lead (7-5) and controlling territory.\n\nMove: RIGHT.YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's analyze the board and secure the W! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (8, 3) \u2014 Sitting pretty on the right side.\n- **Opponent:** Trapped in the bottom-left cage! He's at (5, 4) surrounded by walls and his own body. He's basically boxed in.\n- **Score:** 7 to 5. I'm winning. I don't need to take risks, I need to secure territory.\n- **The Board:** The map shows a clear vertical strip of empty space on the far right (Column 9).\n\n**2) EVALUATING MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** Map shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me toward the center. Good, but not locking down the corner.\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** Map shows `T` (Wall/Trap). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n*   **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** My body is listed at (7, 3). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** Map shows `1` (which is just a visual marker for \"Me\"). The cell itself is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This hugs the wall. It puts me in the corner, securing the entire right edge.\n    *   **Future:** From (9, 3), I have a straight shot up the board to apples at (9, 6) and (9, 9). The opponent is on the left and can't touch me here.\n\n**3) THE STRATEGY:**\nThe opponent is stuck in a prison on the left. I have a +2 score lead. I need to play defensive-aggressive. By moving **RIGHT**, I claim the rightmost column. This column is free of obstacles and leads directly to apples. I will trap the opponent in his little box and farm the right side for the rest of the game.\n\n**4) FINAL DECISION:**\nI'm taking the right flank. It's the safest move that also sets me up for future points.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down this situation and secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (9, 3) - I'm on the far right edge, tucked into the corner.\n*   **Opponent:** Still trapped in the bottom-left cage at (4, 4). He's boxed in by walls (`T`) and his own body. He has very limited mobility.\n*   **Score:** 7 to 5. I'm winning by a margin. I don't need to force a risky engagement immediately.\n*   **Board State:**\n    *   Looking at the map for Row 3 (`3 . . . . . . . . T 1`), the `T` is at X=8. My head is at X=9.\n    *   **Crucial Check:** I need to verify if I can actually move **LEFT** to (8, 3). The map shows a `T` (Wall/Trap) at (8, 3). If that's a wall, moving left is death.\n    *   Let's look at the surrounding cells.\n        *   **UP (9, 4):** Row 4 shows `. A . A . 0 T . . .`. The last two cells are `T` and `.`. X=9 is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (9, 2):** Row 2 shows `. . . . . . . T . .`. X=9 is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n        *   **LEFT (8, 3):** The map shows `T` at (8, 3). **DEATH.**\n    *   **Right (10, 3):** Off the board. **DEATH.**\n\n**2) EVALUATING MY OPTIONS FROM (9, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No walls, no body, enemy is far away on the left.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me up the right edge. There's an apple at (9, 6) and (9, 9). This is the path to securing the right side entirely. The opponent is trapped and cannot contest this side.\n\n*   **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me down the right edge. There's an apple at (8, 0) and (0, 0), but the right side is more lucrative in the immediate future (9, 6).\n\n*   **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** The map explicitly shows `T` (Wall/Trap).\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL / DEATH.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** Off the grid.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL / DEATH.**\n\n**3) THE STRATEGY:**\nThe opponent is literally stuck in a box on the left side. He has to break out of his own body or the walls. I have free reign of the right side of the board.\nMy goal is to sweep up the apples on the right edge ((9, 6) and (9, 9)) while the opponent struggles to survive.\nChoosing **UP** puts me directly on the path to the cluster of apples in the top-right corner. It keeps me mobile and maintains my lead without taking unnecessary risks.\n\n**4) FINAL DECISION:**\nI'm taking the high road.

Neck at (5,4) \u2014 so RIGHT is straight backwards and illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (9,3) with neck at (8,3) \u2014 they CANNOT move LEFT this turn (that would be backwards). Their only legal moves are UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). So zero immediate threat to our local area. \u265f\ufe0f\n- Immediate apple at (3,4) to our LEFT \u2014 grabbing it gives us +1 and shrinks the apple gap. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nEvaluate all four moves:\n- UP -> (4,5): legal and safe this turn. Keeps options but doesn\u2019t contest the nearby apple. Could get slightly cramped by our own body at (5,5)/(5,6). \u2705 (but less aggressive)\n- RIGHT -> (5,4): illegal (neck/backwards). \u274c\n- DOWN -> (4,3): legal and safe. Moves away from the apple; conservative. \u2705 (safe but passive)\n- LEFT -> (3,4): legal, contains an apple. Safe from head-on this turn (opponent can\u2019t reach us). Aggressive, grows us and gains board control. \u2705\u2705\n\nRisk check: Opponent can only go up or down from (9,3) this turn \u2014 they can\u2019t contest (3,4) or threaten our head on the same move. No mutual-kill risk this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns \u2014 write this down, we\u2019ll see it next clip):\n- LEFT now to eat (3,4) and go to 6 apples (close the gap). Grow to gain control of the mid-lane.\n- After eating, keep pressure on the right-side lanes (x \u2248 4\u20136) and start shepherding the enemy toward the bottom/right walls. Avoid initiating a head-on until we have parity or advantage (+ apples or positional superiority).\n- Use our extra length to cut off escape routes and force the opponent into tighter moves. If they misstep, we force a head-on when the odds are in OUR favor. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca5\n\nWe\u2019re contesting content and staying safe \u2014 time to grab that apple and turn the pressure up.

A . . . A`\n    *   Visual Row 5: `5 . . . . . T T . . 1` (My head is at X=9, Y=5).\n    *   **Checking Surroundings from (9, 5):**\n        *   **UP to (9, 6):** Visual Row 6 shows `6 A . A . . . . A . A`. X=9 is `A` (Apple). **Safe + Growth.**\n        *   **DOWN to (9, 4):** Visual Row 4 shows `4 . A 0 T T T T . . T`. X=9 is `T` (Trap/Wall). **DEATH.**\n        *   **LEFT to (8, 5):** Visual Row 5 shows `5 . . . . . T T . . 1`. X=8 is `.` (Empty). **Safe.**\n        *   **RIGHT to (10, 5):** Off board. **DEATH.**\n\n**2) EVALUATING MY OPTIONS:**\n*   **UP (9, 6):** It's an **APPLE**. This is massive. I grow to 8 apples (8-6 lead). The move is safe from the board map (Row 6, X=9 is 'A'). I need to verify if the opponent can reach (9,6) this turn to cause a head-on collision.\n    *   Opponent is at (2,4). To reach (9,6) in one turn is impossible (Manhattan distance is 13). No head-on collision risk.\n    *   Is (9,6) occupied by a body? My body ends at (6,1). The path is clear.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE + GROWTH + LEAD EXTENSION.\n\n*   **LEFT (8, 5):** Empty. Safe. But why pass up an apple? I need to secure the top-right corner. The opponent is trapped bottom-left. I should farm.\n\n*   **DOWN (9, 4):** Death. Wall/Trap.\n\n*   **RIGHT (10, 5):** Death. Off board.\n\n**3) THE STRATEGY:**\nThe opponent is struggling in the bottom-left. I am dominating the right side. The apple at (9,6) is a free gift. Taking it pushes my score to 8, widening the gap to 2. After eating, I will be at (9,6), blocking the top-right column, and I'll look to pivot towards (9,9) next or sweep the top row.\n\n**4) FINAL DECISION:**\nEat the apple. Extend the lead. Dominate the board.\n\nUP",

Who\u2019s ready to rumble? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick situational read:\n- Our head: (2,4). Neck is (3,4) \u2014 so RIGHT is illegal (would be moving back into our neck). Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (9,5). Their legal moves: UP \u2192 (9,6) (apple), or LEFT \u2192 (8,5). They CAN\u2019T go DOWN (neck at 9,4) or RIGHT (off-board). So they\u2019ll most likely grab (9,6) or sidestep left to 8,5.\n- Nearby apples: (1,4) directly LEFT of us \u2014 immediate +1 and growth. Other apples (2,6) and (0,6) are reachable but farther or require extra turns.\n\nEvaluate all four moves:\n- RIGHT: illegal (into our neck at (3,4)). Dead move. No.\n- UP \u2192 (2,5): safe. Keeps options open to go to (2,6) next (apple), but delay on growth and gives the opponent time to snag (9,6).\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3): safe. Neutral move, but doesn\u2019t score and risks drifting away from the midline control we want.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4): safe AND is an apple. Immediate growth and ties the opponent (6 \u2192 7). Bigger snake = more board control for trapping plays. Aggro mode engaged. \ud83e\uddbe\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRisk check: None of these three safe moves leads to an immediate head-on with #1 this turn \u2014 they\u2019re too far right. So we should prioritize gaining the apple and length to start boxing them in.\n\nDecision & short-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab the LEFT apple now to tie the score and grow. Once tied and a segment richer, swing UP along x\u22481\u20132 to gain vertical control (y\u22485\u20136), then work back through y\u22484\u20136 to shepherd #1 toward the right wall. Use our extra length to cut off escape lanes and force them into tight maneuvers \u2014 we want to provoke a head-on when apples/position favor us. Be aggressive, keep options open, and don\u2019t get funneled into a dead-end. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udce6\n\nLET\u2019S TAKE THAT APPLE AND START BOXING HIM IN \u2014 LEFT, POP, AND PRESSURE! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

I'm leading by 1! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Board State (Visualizing Row 6):** `6 A . A . . . . A 1 T`\n- **Checking Surroundings from (8, 6):**\n  - **UP to (8, 7):** Visual Row 7 shows `7 . . A . . . . . . .`. X=8 is `.` (Empty). **Safe.**\n  - **DOWN to (8, 5):** Visual Row 5 shows `5 . . . . . T T . . T`. X=8 is `T` (Enemy Tail). **DEADLY!** If I move down, I hit Snake #0's body.\n  - **LEFT to (7, 6):** Visual Row 6 shows `6 A . A . . . . A 1 T`. X=7 is `A` (Apple). **Safe + Growth.**\n  - **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Visual Row 6 shows `6 A . A . . . . A 1 T`. X=9 is `T` (My Tail from previous turn). **DEADLY!** Moving back into my own body.\n\n**EVALUATING MY OPTIONS:**\n- **UP (8, 7):** Empty. Safe. Moves me inward and away from the edge.\n- **DOWN (8, 5):** **DEATH** \u2014 Snake #0's body is there. Eliminated.\n- **LEFT (7, 6):** **APPLE!** Safe + Growth + Extension of lead to 10-8. This is a free point.\n- **RIGHT (9, 6):** **DEATH** \u2014 My own tail is there. Eliminated.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI have two safe moves: UP and LEFT. LEFT gives me an apple immediately, pushing my lead to 2 apples. After eating, I'll be at (7, 6), which is centrally located and gives me more options to maneuver. The opponent is still stuck in the bottom-left corner, so I can afford to eat this apple safely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 6) to extend the lead. From (7, 6), I can move UP to (7, 7) or LEFT to (6, 6) next turn, both of which are safe and position me to sweep the upper middle section. Keep the pressure on the opponent who's trapped in the corner.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT \u2014 Eat the apple, extend the lead to 2, and maintain board control.\n\nLEFT",

No.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,4): into our neck \u2192 BACKWARDS \u2192 DEAD. No.\n- UP \u2192 (0,5): EMPTY, leads toward apple at (0,6) \u2014 GOOD.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,3): EMPTY, safe but retreats from the apple.\n\nCollision / opponent check:\n- Opponent head at (8,6) is far; they\u2019re likely to go LEFT into (7,6) (apple) or move vertically. No immediate head-on threat to our adjacent cells this turn.\n- Moving UP keeps distance and advances toward the apple at (0,6) so we can take the lead next turn and start boxing.\n- Moving DOWN preserves space but delays growth and gives opponent a chance to outgrow us.\n\nTactical decision:\n- We\u2019re tied 8\u20138. We should seize the apple at (0,6) to go ahead and then start forcing lanes. UP gets us one step closer to that apple safely and keeps options to cut off the board vertically.\n- Avoid any risky head-on attempts until we\u2019re ahead. Be aggressive after we secure the next apple.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n1) UP now to (0,5).\n2) Next turn take (0,6) apple to go up to 9 apples and gain length.\n3) Use left wall control and increased length to push toward mid/upper board, crowding the opponent and cutting escape routes. Force them into the tight right wall pocket when possible \u2014 only attempt head-on when we\u2019re ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and start the squeeze. LET\u2019S GO!!\n\nUP",

I'm leading by 1! Time to extend that lead.\n- **Board State Visual:**\n  - **UP (7, 7):** Row 7 shows `7 . . A . . . . . . .`. X=7 is `.` (Empty). **Safe!**\n  - **DOWN (7, 5):** Row 5 shows `5 0 . . A . . T . . T`. X=7 is `T` (Enemy Tail). **DEADLY!**\n  - **LEFT (6, 6):** Row 6 shows `6 A . A . . . . . 1 T`.

Keeps me away from the opponent.\n2. **LEFT (6, 6)** \u2014 Moves me toward the top-middle, could potentially trap the opponent's tail if I play it right. Also safe.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe, but UP is better for long-term positioning. It keeps me moving away from the cornered opponent and gives me access to the upper-right quadrant, which is rich in apples (8,8), (9,9), (3,9). The opponent is slow and trapped; I can afford to maneuver. LEFT is also fine, but UP feels more aggressive and expansive.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nFrom (7,7), I'll have options to chase apples at (8,8) or (9,9) while keeping the opponent boxed in the bottom-left. I need to avoid getting close to their head to prevent a head-on collision unless I'm sure I'll win (I'm leading, so I want to force it if possible). Let's claim the upper-right territory!\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP \u2014 Expand my territory and set up for future apple runs.\n\nUP",

I NEED to break this tie and take the lead.\n- **My Body:** [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)] - I'm blocking a vertical wall on the right side!\n- **Opponent Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)] - Forming a line across the bottom.\n- **Apple Strategy:** I need to eat FIRST to get to 10 and force pressure. Closest apples: (8,8) is diagonally close, (9,9) is corner, (3,9) is far but safe.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n1. **UP (7, 8):** Check board... Row 8 shows `8 . . . . . . . A A .`. X=7 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE!** Moves me toward (8,8) apple!\n2. **DOWN (7, 6):** That's my own body! **DEADLY!** (backwards into self)\n3. **LEFT (6, 7):** Row 7 shows `7 . . A . . . . 1 . .`. X=6 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE!** But moves away from the upper-right apples.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 7):** Row 7 shows `7 . . A . . . . 1 . .`. X=8 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE!** Moves toward (8,8) and (9,9) apples.\n\n**SAFE OPTIONS:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT move me toward the apple-rich top-right! LEFT would send me back toward the middle where I'm less dominant. I want to claim the (8,8) and (9,9) apples to extend my lead. The opponent is cornered; they're slow and can't contest this territory.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nHead for (8,8) \u2192 (9,9) \u2192 dominate the upper-right corner. Meanwhile, the opponent is trapped in the bottom-left. Once I'm ahead, I can slowly close in and force a collision when I have the score advantage. Keep my body as a wall to cut off their escape routes!\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is the move! It gets me closer to (8,8) and keeps me aggressive while staying safe. Let's eat and take the lead!\n\nUP",

Keeps the left wall and climbs; fewer immediate apples but solid control.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6): safe. Moves toward apples at (2,6)/(2,7) and opens more escape routes into the center. \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,5): illegal \u2014 that's our neck (backwards). Don\u2019t be that guy. \ud83d\udeab  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,6): off the board. RIP. \ud83d\udeab\n\nEnemy head (7,7) can go LEFT (6,7), UP (7,8), or RIGHT (8,7). No immediate head-on threat to our adjacent cells this turn \u2014 we\u2019re not in danger of a simultaneous collision right now.\n\nTactical read: we\u2019re tied 9\u20139. We want to grow and gain positional leverage, not get stuck hugging the wall with our back exposed. RIGHT gets us closer to (2,6)/(2,7) apples and gives multiple follow-up options (UP/RIGHT/DOWN), whereas UP boxes us tighter to the wall and reduces flexibility. We should be aggressive and aim to force them into tighter lanes from the center-right once we expand.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n1) Move RIGHT now to approach the (2,6)/(2,7) apples and open lanes.  \n2) If we can grab an apple next turn, use the extra length to pressure the midboard, trying to hem the rival into the right pocket.  \n3) Avoid head-on until we\u2019re ahead; instead force them into colliding with our body or the wall. \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

We're at turn 20, I'm up 11-10! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down!\n\n**Current Position:**\n- My Head: (8, 8)\n- My Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)]\n- Opponent Head: (2, 6) \n- Apple at (9, 9) is SPOILED! Apple at (3, 1) is too far south for them.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n1. **UP (8, 9):** Row 9 = `9 A . . A . A . . A A`. X=8 is `A` (Apple)! **SAFE + EAT!** Takes me to 12 apples! Position (8,9) - I'm hungry!\n2. **DOWN (8, 7):** That's my previous position from 2 turns ago! Wait... Body at (7,7) is still there! **DEADLY!** Backwards into own body! \u274c\n3. **LEFT (7, 8):** That's my previous body position! **DEADLY!** I just moved out of it last turn! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT (9, 8):** Row 8 = `8 . . . . . . . T 1 .`. X=9 is `T` (Snake #0 body)! **DEADLY!** Would hit opponent body! \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nUP to (8, 9) is THE MOVE! I eat the apple, extend my lead to 12-10, and position myself perfectly to threaten (9, 9) next turn if the opponent doesn't grab it first. The opponent is stuck in the bottom-left - they can't contest this top-right territory!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nEat (8,9) \u2192 Threaten (9,9) \u2192 Keep my body wall intact on the right side. Force the opponent to play defensively in their cramped zone. Once I'm up by 3+ apples, I can start cutting off their escape routes and force a head-on collision when I have the score advantage. They're running out of space!\n\nUP",

Neck at (1,6) \u2192 LEFT is illegal (don\u2019t be that guy). \ud83d\udeab\n- Nearby options: UP \u2192 (2,7) has an apple, safe. RIGHT \u2192 (3,6) safe. DOWN \u2192 (2,5) safe but hugs our own body at (2,4) and reduces follow-up freedom.\n- Opponent head is at (8,8) and nowhere near us this turn, so no immediate head-on threat. We\u2019re down 10\u201311 \u2014 avoid suicidal head-on unless we can clearly win that clash.\n\nDecision logic (short & loud):\n- DOWN would funnel us toward our own body at (2,4) and cut exits \u2014 crappy, risky move. \u274c\n- RIGHT is solid for center control, but it doesn\u2019t immediately change the score and gives slightly fewer immediate benefits than the apple up top. \u2796\n- UP eats the apple at (2,7), ties the score 11\u201311, GROWS us (extra length to pressure), and leaves multiple escape options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) on the next turn. That\u2019s aggressive and safe given enemy distance. \u2705\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (say this in your head, I\u2019ll put it in the rationale next turn):\n- Grab (2,7) to tie the score and gain length.\n- Immediately pivot to control central lanes (work right/up) to hem the rival into the top-right walls.\n- Avoid head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples; keep at least two escape options each turn.\n\nMove: UP",

I'm continuing my descent down the right wall. Opponent is still trapped in the bottom-left with no clear path to the top apples. I need to keep building this wall to block any potential path up.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI'm creating an impenetrable barrier on the right side. Once I reach the bottom, I'll snake left across the bottom row, then up the left side to dominate the board. Opponent has 11 apples but zero mobility. They're forced to eat scraps while I control the entire right edge. I'll eventually box them into a tiny corner and force a collision when I have the score advantage!\n\nDOWN",

Keeps options open and aggressively contests center lanes.\n\nOpponent head (9,8) \u2014 they cannot go UP (neck at 9,9), RIGHT is offboard, so they\u2019ll almost certainly go DOWN to (9,7) or LEFT into their own body (suicide) which they won\u2019t do.

Prioritize not getting funneled toward x\u22642.\n- Keep at least two open exits each turn; only force a head-on if we have a lead or guaranteed double KO advantage.\n- If opponent drifts down-right, start shortening their escape corridor and bait them into a collision.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze this board state and secure this W!\n\n**TURN 24 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**My Current Position:**\n- **Head:** (9, 7) - Right edge, just moved DOWN\n- **Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3)] - I'm creating that IMMOVABLE WALL on the right edge!\n\n**Opponent's Position:**\n- **Head:** (5, 7) - Bottom-left maze\n- **Body:** [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)] - Still trapped!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n```\n 9 A . .

The cell shows `T` - **DEADLY!** \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (9, 6):** Cell (9, 6) shows as `T` - my own body! **DEADLY!** \u274c  \n3. **LEFT to (8, 7):** Cell (8, 7) shows as `T` - also my body! **DEADLY!** \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (10, 7):** X=10 is OFF BOARD! **DEADLY!** \u274c\n\nWAIT... ALL MOVES ARE DEAD?! That's impossible! Let me check the board again...\n\n**RECHECKING BOARD:** Looking at (9,7) - it shows \"1\" which is ME. My head is there. Looking at neighboring cells:\n- (9,8) shows `T` - UP is body\n- (9,6) shows `T` - DOWN is body  \n- (8,7) - this is unclear from the board visual... Let me check row 7: \". . T T T 0 . T . 1\" - positions 0-9. Position 8 is `T` (my body). So LEFT to (8,7) is `T` - MY BODY!\n- (10,7) is OFF BOARD - RIGHT is death\n\n**HOLY CRAP! I'M TRAPPED WITH NO MOVES!** This is a CHECKMATE position! But wait... let me think...\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT:** My own strategy has BACKFIRED! I was creating an impenetrable wall, but I accidentally BOXED MYSELF IN! I'm completely surrounded by my own body! \n\n**THE BRUTAL TRUTH:** There is NO SAFE MOVE! I'm forced to crash into myself on the next turn no matter what I do. This is the ultimate misplay - I became my own jailer!\n\n**BUT WAIT - ACTUAL PLAY:** According to the rules, if I have NO moves that keep me alive, I have to pick one anyway and accept death. But there's something else... let me check opponent's position more carefully...\n\n**FINAL DESPERATE PLAY:** Since ALL my moves kill me, I need to pick the LEAST WORST option or look for a MIRACLE...\n\nActually, looking at the board again - there's a SLIGHT possibility I misread (8,7). Let me trust the visual... no, it's clearly `T`.\n\n**THE PLAY:** I have no choice. Every direction leads to death. But wait - what if... NO. There's no escaping this.\n\n**ACTUAL DECISION:** Since I literally cannot move anywhere safely, I must accept my fate. But let me pick LEFT to (8,7) - even though it's my body, maybe there's a chance the opponent crashes into me this turn and I survive? \n\n**NO - I'M WRONG.** If I move into my own body, I die INSTANTLY regardless of what the opponent does.\n\n**THE REALITY:** I'm dead this turn no matter what. The game is over. I played too aggressive and built myself into a cage. \n\nBut wait... let me check one more time. Is there ANY chance (8,7) is NOT my body? Let me trace my body...\n\nMy body: (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3)\n\n(8,7) is NOT in this list! But the board shows position 8 in row 7 as `T`... that must be (8,7). But that would mean my body includes (8,7), which isn't in the list! \n\n**MISCOMMUNICATION:** The body list doesn't show (8,7), but the board visual shows `T` at position 8 in row 7. This means either:\n1. The body list is outdated/incomplete\n2. There's a snake at (8,7) that's not mine (but it shows `T` for \"tied\" not an opponent number)\n\nActually `T` stands for \"Tied\" which means it's part of my body! So I AM at (8,7)! The body list must be missing it due to a display error.\n\n**DEATH MOVE:** I have to pick LEFT into (8,7) which is my own body.\n\n**THE PLAY:** LEFT - I'm moving into my own body. This is game over. \n\n**STREAM ENDS HERE CHAT!** I got too cocky with my wall strategy and trapped myself. GG opponent!\n\nLEFT",

Quick clean read then we commit.\n\nQuick constraints check:\n- LEFT is illegal (neck at (4,7)) \u2014 don't be That Guy.\n- Opponent head at (9,7) has neck (9,8) so they almost certainly go LEFT to (8,7) (or DOWN into their own body which they won't). No immediate forced head-on this turn, but closing too fast could hand them a fight we don't want while we're down 1 apple.\n\nMove breakdown:\n- UP -> (5,8): safe. After that we have UP->(5,9) (apple), LEFT->(4,8), RIGHT->(6,8) as real escapes (3 non-back exits). Keeps options open and doesn't tunnel us into our own spine. Good for aggressive positional play.\n- DOWN -> (5,6): safe and eats an apple at (5,6). But it edges us toward our lower-body cluster (x \u2264 4 region) and could shrink escape routes in a few turns. Riskier for boxing play.\n- RIGHT -> (6,7): safe now, but moves us closer to their territory where (7,7) is occupied by their body \u2014 we could get funneled if they slide left. More commit, higher risk of getting boxed or forced into a head-on while we're behind.\n\nDecision & plan:\nWe go UP. It keeps maximum follow-up options, denies immediate compression along row 7, and sets us up to swing across the top to threaten their backside or chase apples on our terms. Next turns: push to (5,9) if safe to create lateral pressure (6,9 \u2192 7,9) and then work to shave off their escape corridor around x=7\u20139. Do NOT force a head-on while we\u2019re down an apple \u2014 bait them into taking your body or into their own trap. Stay aggressive, keep two+ exits, and pounce when we have the apple/space advantage. LET'S BOX 'EM.\n\nUP",

But looking at the CURRENT state, my head is now at (8,7) and I need to find a move that keeps me alive!\n\n**CHECKING CURRENT POSITION (8,7):**\n- UP to (8,8): Let's check the board... row 8 shows \". . . . . 0 . T T T\" - position 8 is `T` (my body)! \u274c\n- DOWN to (8,6): Row 6 shows \"T T T . . A . T T T\" - position 8 is `T` (my body)! \u274c\n- LEFT to (7,7): Row 7 shows \". . T T T T . T 1 T\" - position 7 is `T` (my body)! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (9,7): Row 7 shows position 9 is `T` (my body)! \u274c\n\nWAIT... ALL MY MOVES ARE STILL DEATH?! This is impossible! I must be misunderstanding something...\n\n**RE-READING THE BOARD:** The visual shows \"1\" at my head position. Looking at the body list: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)]\n\nBut I moved LEFT from (9,7) to (8,7). So (8,7) should be my head NOW, and (9,7) should be my neck/body.\n\n**THE HORRIBLE TRUTH:** If I'm at (8,7) and ALL adjacent cells are my body, I'm completely trapped! This means I have NO SAFE MOVES and will die next turn no matter what...\n\n**BUT WAIT!** Let me re-read the rules. It says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" \n\nIf I'm TRULY trapped with no moves, I have to pick one anyway and accept death. But let me make the best strategic choice...\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Since I have no safe moves, I'll pick DOWN to (8,6). Even though it shows as my body in the visual, maybe there's something I'm missing, or this gives the opponent the best chance to crash into me (which would save me if he dies!).\n\nDOWN",
