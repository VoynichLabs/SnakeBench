LEFT (4,4) is safe but drifts away from the middle contested space. Going UP to (5,5) keeps me central, keeps three safe follow-up options, and lets me watch for their descent while still being threatening.\n\nPlan: stay centralized and force them to commit to one side while I look for an opening to cut them off or bait a head-on.\n\nUP",

Apples are scattered, but we're ignoring them for now? Nah, we can use them as bait later. But first, survival and positioning!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK** (Turn 0 moves):\n- UP: (6,10) \u2192 off board \u274c DEAD.\n- DOWN: (6,8) \u2192 empty, safe \u2705.\n- LEFT: (5,9) \u2192 empty, safe \u2705.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) \u2192 empty, safe \u2705.\n\nAll three moves are safe. No body segments yet, so no self-collision risk. Enemy is far away, no immediate head-on threat.\n\n**STRATEGY THINKING** \ud83e\udde0:\nWe want to dominate the board early. Enemy is at (5,4). I'm at (6,9). I could move toward center to control space, or maybe go for an apple to grow and get a length advantage. But apples are distractions unless they help us cut off the enemy.\n\nLooking at apples: closest to me is (7,8) and (7,7) below me. If I go DOWN to (6,8), I'm closer to those. If I go LEFT to (5,9), I'm near (3,8) apple but farther from enemy. If I go RIGHT to (7,9), I'm near (7,8) apple too.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**:\nWe need to pressure the enemy. With equal length, head-on collision kills both. So we avoid that unless we have a length advantage. So step 1: get an apple safely. Step 2: use length to force enemy into traps.\n\nRight now, going DOWN feels natural\u2014it keeps me in the top half but moves toward center and apples. LEFT goes toward left side apples but away from enemy. RIGHT goes toward right side apples.\n\nI think DOWN is solid\u2014opens future options to go LEFT/RIGHT next turn, and puts me closer to apples at (7,8) and (7,7) for potential growth.\n\n**FINAL PICK**:\nDOWN gives flexibility, avoids boxing myself in a corner early, and starts the growth journey. Let's move!\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves for them:  \n- UP to (5,6)  \n- DOWN to (5,4)  \n- LEFT to (4,5)  \n- RIGHT to (6,5)  \n\nIf they go RIGHT to (6,5), they\u2019re moving toward center.

With length 2 vs 1, we can start forcing head-on collisions to win. That\u2019s huge early pressure.  \n\nBut is it safe? (7,8) is empty now. Next turn after eating, our tail stays at (6,8) until we move again, so our body will be at (7,8) head and (6,8) tail. Enemy can\u2019t reach (7,8) in one turn from (5,5). No risk of them moving into our new head spot unless they go (6,5)\u2192(7,5)\u2192(7,6)\u2192(7,7)\u2192(7,8) in 3 turns, but they won\u2019t.  \n\nGoing RIGHT also puts us near cluster of apples at (7,7), (7,3), (7,2) \u2014 we can chain eats and grow fast.  \n\nAlternative: LEFT to (5,8) moves us toward left-side apples but away from enemy \u2014 lets them get apples on their side. DOWN to (6,7) moves toward center but no immediate apple. UP to (6,9) back to start \u2014 pointless.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS**:  \nIf we eat now \u2192 length 2. Next turn, we can move toward enemy while they\u2019re length 1. Force them into corners or set up head-on collision where we win. Use our extra segment as a shield.  \n\nRIGHT is aggressive, gets us growth, and positions us to cut off top-right area.  \n\n**FINAL PICK**:  \nRIGHT \u2014 get that apple, get longer, DOMINATE EARLY.  \n\nRIGHT",

Puts us near top edge, limits future options.  \n2. **DOWN (7,7)** \u2014 apple! Grows us to length 3 instantly.

If we eat now \u2192 length 3. That\u2019s a **two-segment advantage**! Then we can aggressively cut off their movement and force head-on collisions we win.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (7,7) also keeps us central, with follow-up moves possible in 3 directions (UP back to (7,8) is our tail next turn, so safe; LEFT to (6,7); RIGHT to (8,7)).  \n\nIf enemy goes to (6,6) for apple, they grow to length 2. Then next turn:  \n- Our head at (7,7), length 3  \n- Their head at (6,6), length 2  \n\nWe can move LEFT to (6,7) to block them from going up, or DOWN to (7,6) to pressure. Either way, we have advantage.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nEat, grow, pressure enemy into corners. Use length to cut off escape routes. Avoid letting them get multiple apples unchallenged.  \n\n**FINAL PICK**  \nDOWN \u2014 secure the growth, maintain board control, set up for domination.  \n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re playing to box THEM in, not give them the field to breathe, right?\n\nPlan for the next few turns: climb up toward their flank and start laying a perimeter, keeping the left corridor open so we can cut them off if they try to swing wide.

Puts us on top edge. Risk: next turn we're longer, but top row limits upward moves.  \n2. **LEFT (5,8)** \u2014 safe, no apple. Moves us left, closer to enemy if they go UP. Could start cutting off their upward escape.  \n3. **RIGHT (7,8)** \u2014 safe, no apple. Moves us right, toward apple at (7,9) and (9,9). Our tail at (7,7) moves next turn if we don't eat, opening (7,8) for future.\n\n**STRATEGY**  \nWe have length advantage. Eating apple grows our lead and makes us even longer \u2014 more body to trap enemy with!  \nBut we must avoid getting trapped ourselves.  \nIf we eat apple at (6,9), our tail stays at (7,7), so our body becomes: head (6,9), then (6,8), (6,7), (7,7). That's a bit coiled but okay.  \nGoing LEFT pressures enemy if they move up. Going RIGHT claims right side.  \nI think EATING is huge \u2014 extends lead, makes us more threatening for head-on collisions. Enemy can't afford to crash into us once we're longer.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**  \nIf we eat apple: we're length 4, enemy length 2. Next turn, focus on cutting off enemy's space. They'll likely move toward apples on left/bottom. We can swing down from top to herd them into a corner. Use our body as a wall.  \nIf we don't eat: we stay length 3, but tail moves, maybe we can eat later.  \nBut content is key \u2014 eating apple gives us points and growth! Let's secure that lead.\n\n**DECISION**  \nUP \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, EXTEND THE LEAD, DOMINATE THE BOARD! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

We have a 3-to-1 apple lead! Time to press the advantage and box this fool in! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK** from head (7,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,10) \u274c **OFF THE BOARD** \u2014 DEATH.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) \u2705 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) \u274c **OUR OWN BODY** (segment right behind head) \u2014 DEATH.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) \u2705 empty.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP is out of bounds, LEFT is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \ud83e\udde0**  \nEnemy head at (5,7), body at (5,6). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (5,8) \u2705 empty.\n- DOWN to (5,6) \u274c their own body.\n- LEFT to (4,7) \u2705 empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,7) \u274c **OUR BODY** at (6,7) \u2014 that would kill them if they go there! \ud83d\ude08\n\nThey can go UP or LEFT safely. RIGHT into our body is suicide for them. They might want apple at (3,8) (UP/LEFT), (2,8) (UP/LEFT), (1,7) (LEFT/UP), (0,4) (LEFT/DOWN). They'll probably go toward apples.\n\n**COLLISION RISK THIS TURN**  \nWe move simultaneously. If we go DOWN to (7,8) and they go LEFT to (4,7) \u2014 no collision. If we go RIGHT to (8,9) and they go UP to (5,8) \u2014 no collision. No direct head-on possible \u2014 they're at least 3 cells away.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS ANALYSIS**  \n\n1. **DOWN (7,8)** \u2014 safe, no apple. Moves us down from top edge, opens up future moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT next turn. Puts us closer to center, can start cutting off enemy's upward path.\n2. **RIGHT (8,9)** \u2014 safe, no apple. Moves us along top edge to the right, closer to corner. Limits future moves \u2014 from (8,9) only DOWN and LEFT likely safe next turn (UP off board, RIGHT off board). Riskier for getting trapped.\n\n**STRATEGY**  \nWe have a big length advantage (5 vs 2). We don't need to chase apples right now \u2014 we need to use our body as a wall to trap the enemy! Our body currently forms a vertical line from (6,7) to (6,9) plus tail at (7,7). If we go DOWN to (7,8), we create a potential horizontal barrier along y=8. Next turn we can go LEFT to (6,8) (but that's our body then? careful) or further DOWN to (7,7) (tail will move if we don't eat apple). Actually, our tail is at (7,7) \u2014 if we go DOWN to (7,8), tail stays at (7,7) this turn, then next turn tail moves to (6,7) if we don't eat apple. So we can start coiling to block off top-right area.\n\nBetter plan: go DOWN to (7,8), then next turn possibly LEFT to (6,8) (if safe) to tighten the coil and push enemy toward left wall. Enemy is at (5,7) \u2014 if they go UP to (5,8), we can potentially cut them off from above.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**  \nWe have length 5 vs enemy length 2. Use our body to create a moving wall. Force enemy into left side, then bottom-left corner. Avoid getting stuck in top-right corner ourselves. If we go RIGHT now, we corner ourselves. Go DOWN to maintain mobility and control center. Keep aggressive positioning \u2014 aim to force a head-on collision when we have length advantage. Watch for apples as bonus but don't risk trap for them.\n\n**DECISION**  \nDOWN \u2014 MAINTAIN MOBILITY, PRESS THE ENEMY, SET UP THE BOX! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is trapped against the top wall with only one escape. We can start boxing them in!  \nOur body forms an L-shape in top-right: head (8,8), then (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), tail at (6,7).  \nEnemy will be at (4,9). We can move LEFT to (7,8) to cut off their potential downward escape, or UP to (8,9) to press from above.  \nBut think long-term: we want to force them into a corner. If we go LEFT to (7,8), we block them from moving right into our territory. If we go UP to (8,9), we stay high but don't directly pressure them yet.  \nActually, going DOWN to (8,7) might be too passive \u2014 lets them breathe.  \nGoing RIGHT to (9,8) pushes us toward the right wall \u2014 risky if we get trapped later.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE**  \nLet's move **LEFT to (7,8)**! This does two things:\n1. It positions us directly between the enemy and the right side of the board, cutting off their escape route east.\n2. From (7,8) next turn, we can go UP to (7,9) (our own body then, but maybe not safe), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8) (our body), RIGHT to (8,8) (empty). Actually, careful \u2014 moving LEFT to (7,8) means next turn our body will be: head (7,8), then (8,8), (7,8)?? Wait, let's track: after move, body becomes: new head (7,8), then old head (8,8), then (7,8) is duplicate? No \u2014 our current body is [(8,8), (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8)]? Let's recalc properly:\n\nCurrent body: head (8,8), then (7,8), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8) \u2014 tail at (6,7)? Wait, apples collected: 3, so length is 5 segments? Actually starting length is 4? Let's check: we have 3 apples, so length = initial length (4) + apples (3) = 7? No \u2014 initial snake length is 4? Let's see board: at turn 9, our body listed: head (8,8), body: [(7,8), (7,9), (6,9)] \u2014 that's only 4 segments total (head + 3 body). But apples collected: 3, so length should be 4+3=7. That means there are more tail segments not shown? Possibly the board display only shows part? Actually the board shows '1' at our head, 'T' at our tail? I see 'T' at (6,9) and (7,9) and (7,8)? Confusing. But given the rules, our length is 4 + apples = 7. So we have a longer tail off-screen maybe? The board only shows 'T' for tail segments? Hmm.\n\nRegardless, safe moves are all four. Let's pick LEFT to pressure enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**  \nWe forced enemy left to (4,9). Next turn, they can only go LEFT to (3,9) or DOWN to (4,8) (since UP off board, RIGHT into our territory). We should move to cut off their DOWN escape. After we move LEFT to (7,8), next turn consider moving DOWN to (7,7) to block the row below them, or continue LEFT to (6,8) (if safe) to squeeze further. Use our length to create a barrier \u2014 they have fewer moves; we can trap them against the top wall!\n\nLEFT",
