DOWN to (1, 8) is not only valid but puts me closer to future opportunities to pursue apples, especially climbing towards the area of (3, 2) or accessing the (0, 1) apple better via upcoming moves.\n\nGiven my safety from enemy snakes and potential future paths - the best option appears to be moving down to explore more options toward the apples on lower rows.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- I will focus on navigating towards the apples, primarily targeting the ones in closer vicinity based on my next moves.\n- Continuously monitoring the enemy snake's position and maintaining distance to avoid being cornered or facing potential threats.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nNavigating down to (1, 8) is my decision, as it opens more avenues for future turns and creates a strategic advantage towards accessing apples.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

To my left (at (2, 9)) and right (at (4, 9)) aren\u2019t walls or other snakes, but I'm also considering maintaining distance from the enemy snake at (9, 3) whose movement could approach me.\n4. The enemy snake is sufficiently far away, but it\u2019s important to stay cautious. \n\n**Plan forward:**\n- I could move DOWN to (3, 8). However, that would bring me back to the position I just vacated, which isn't effective.\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 9) could potentially be beneficial. It allows me to reposition without encountering danger, while I can also consider my options for future moves.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 9) doesn't put me in immediate danger and would also keep me in line with my snake's growth and minimize confrontation.\n\nAfter analyzing, my best option appears to be moving LEFT to position (2, 9). This opens up more possible moves for future turns and keeps my snake strategic and able to gather points from remaining apples.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

Additionally, it does not pose any threat from the enemy snake.\n\n### Future Considerations\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5), I plan to aim for the apple at (3, 2) next round. This keeps my strategy focused on apple collection while minimizing the risk of entering spots near the enemy snake. \n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of possible moves and the immediate goal of collecting apples, moving **DOWN to (3, 5)** is optimal as it progresses toward my apple target while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

Additionally, it does not pose any threat from the enemy snake.\n\n### Future Considerations\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5), I plan to aim for the apple at (3, 2) next round. This keeps my strategy focused on apple collection while minimizing the risk of entering spots near the enemy snake. \n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of possible moves and the immediate goal of collecting apples, moving **DOWN to (3, 5)** is optimal as it progresses toward my apple target while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

Unsafe.\n\nMy safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nLet's find the closest apple from my current head position (4, 2) using Manhattan distance:\n- Apple at (0, 1): |4-0| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- Apple at (7, 8): |4-7| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n- Apple at (0, 8): |4-0| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- Apple at (7, 9): |4-7| + |2-9| = 3 + 7 = 10\n- Apple at (4, 5): |4-4| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 5), which is 3 units away.\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple at (4, 5):\n- Moving UP to (4, 3): Distance to (4, 5) is |4-4| + |3-5| = 0 + 2 = 2. This moves towards the closest apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 1): Distance to (4, 5) is |4-4| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4. This moves away from the closest apple.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 3) is a safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake at (3, 1). Its safe moves could potentially be (3, 0) or (4, 1). My move to (4, 3) does not lead to a head-to-head collision with the enemy's potential safe moves.\n\nMoving UP is the best option as it safely moves towards the closest food source.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue prioritizing safety while moving towards the closest food. Re-evaluate board state, snake positions, and apple locations each turn.\n\nNext Move: UP"

The next closest is at (3, 2) with a distance of 3.\n\nLet's consider how each safe move positions me relative to the closest apple at (7, 1):\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 1): Distance to (7, 1) is |6-7| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1. This moves me closer to (7, 1).\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2): Distance to (7, 1) is |5-7| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. This moves me further away from (7, 1) or keeps the distance the same (distance 3 > 2 is not strictly true, but it doesn't reduce the distance as much as the others).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 2): Distance to (7, 1) is |7-7| + |2-1| = 0 + 1 = 1. This moves me closer to (7, 1).\n\nBoth moving DOWN to (6, 1) and moving RIGHT to (7, 2) are safe moves that reduce the distance to the closest apple (7, 1) to 1. Both positions (6, 1) and (7, 2) are adjacent to the apple at (7, 1), positioning me to eat the apple in the next turn.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3, 7) is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to any of the safe moves.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are good moves. Moving DOWN to (6,1) places me below and to the left of the apple at (7,1), while moving RIGHT to (7,2) places me above and to the right of the apple. Both options allow me to reach the apple in the following move. The previous turn's rationale mentioned reaching (6,1) or (7,2) as the goal after moving to (6,2). I will choose to move DOWN towards (6,1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (6, 1), my head will be at (6, 1) and my body will be [(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)]. The closest apple is still at (7, 1), now distance 1 away.

Additionally, it does not pose any threat from the enemy snake.\n\n### Future Considerations\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5), I plan to aim for the apple at (3, 2) next round. This keeps my strategy focused on apple collection while minimizing the risk of entering spots near the enemy snake. \n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of possible moves and the immediate goal of collecting apples, moving **DOWN to (3, 5)** is optimal as it progresses toward my apple target while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

My move to (4, 5) does not result in a head-to-head collision with the enemy's potential safe moves.\n\nMoving UP is the best option as it safely moves onto a food source, allowing me to grow and gain points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 5) and I will have eaten an apple.

Although it doesn\u2019t approach any apples directly, it allows you to maneuver further.\n- **DOWN to (5, 0)**: This is a safe move as it\u2019s free. However, it puts you along the bottom edge of the board, limiting your options in subsequent moves and keeping you away from the apples.\n\n### Future Considerations:\n- **If I choose RIGHT to (6, 1)**, I can potentially move UP on the next turn if the conditions change.

(Further from 5)\n    - Distance to (7, 9) = |5-7| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Same distance as 5)\n\nMoving UP gets me closer to both (0, 8) and (7, 9) while also getting closer to the closest apple (7, 8). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (7, 8), keeps me the same distance from (7, 9), and moves me further from (0, 8). Therefore, UP is the preferred move as it positions me better relative to multiple apples in the top half of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 8). My body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)]. I will re-evaluate the board state, remaining apple locations, and enemy positions, prioritizing safety and moving towards the closest apple, while also considering strategic positioning relative to other apples and available space.\n\nNext Move: UP."

Additionally, it does not pose any threat from the enemy snake.\n\n### Future Considerations\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5), I plan to aim for the apple at (3, 2) next round. This keeps my strategy focused on apple collection while minimizing the risk of entering spots near the enemy snake. \n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of possible moves and the immediate goal of collecting apples, moving **DOWN to (3, 5)** is optimal as it progresses toward my apple target while avoiding hazards.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

It positions me somewhat closer vertically to the enemy snake's row but gives me room to maneuver.\n- **DOWN to (7, 0)**: This move is safe and could allow further options afterward, but being at the very edge of the board may create restrictions in future turns.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- The focus should be on safely positioning my snake while also maintaining proximity to a future apple. \n- Moving UP to (7, 2) provides an opportunity to move further up towards more potential apples without getting trapped. It also keeps me in a better position to navigate around enemy snakes.\n- The movement RIGHT could risk getting trapped or move me away from future apple strategies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter weighing the options, I decide that moving UP to (7, 2) is preferable.

Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (7, 8), keeps me the same distance from (7, 9), and moves me further from (0, 8). Therefore, UP is the preferred move as it positions me better relative to multiple apples in the top half of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 8). My body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)].

The remaining apples are at (0, 1), (3, 2), (7, 8), (7, 1).

(Further from 5)\n    - Distance to (7, 9) = |5-7| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Same distance as 5)\n\nMoving UP gets me closer to both (0, 8) and (7, 9) while also getting closer to the closest apple (7, 8). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (7, 8), keeps me the same distance from (7, 9), and moves me further from (0, 8). Therefore, UP is the preferred move as it positions me better relative to multiple apples in the top half of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 8). My body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)]. I will re-evaluate the board state, remaining apple locations, and enemy positions, prioritizing safety and moving towards the closest apple, while also considering strategic positioning relative to other apples and available space.\n\nNext Move: UP."

Closer.\n- Move LEFT to (3, 6): Distance to (7, 8) is |3-7| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6. Further.\n- Move RIGHT to (5, 6): Distance to (7, 8) is |5-7| + |6-8| = 2 + 2 = 4. Closer.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves that decrease the distance to the closest apple (7, 8). There is no immediate threat from the enemy snake's position at (7, 1) that makes either UP or RIGHT significantly riskier than the other. Both lead to a next position that is distance 4 from the target apple. Based on the strategy from the previous turn and the current equivalent evaluation, I will choose UP to continue moving towards the apple in that general direction.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 7).

Since (9, 8) and (9, 9) are occupied, it limits the upward mobility since (9, 8) and (8, 8) are also blocked.\n\n4. **Possible Move Options**:\n   - **UP to (9, 8)**: Blocked by enemy snake, illegal move.\n   - **DOWN to (9, 6)**: Clear space and does not lead to collision.\n   - **LEFT to (8, 7)**: Illegal move (going backward onto your body).\n   - **RIGHT to (10, 7)**: Out of bounds, illegal move.\n\n### Strategic Assessment\nGiven the analysis:\n- The only available move without hitting an enemy or yourself is DOWN to (9, 6). Although it doesn't get you closer to an apple immediately, it keeps you safe and free to navigate towards (9,0) in the following turns.\n- After moving down, the next strategic goal would be to maneuver to (9, 5) and then directly down to (9, 0) to collect the apple.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe safest move right now that allows continued play while setting up for apple collection is to move DOWN. \n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN"

DOWN to (1, 8) is not only valid but puts me closer to future opportunities to pursue apples, especially climbing towards the area of (3, 2) or accessing the (0, 1) apple better via upcoming moves.\n\nGiven my safety from enemy snakes and potential future paths - the best option appears to be moving down to explore more options toward the apples on lower rows.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n- I will focus on navigating towards the apples, primarily targeting the ones in closer vicinity based on my next moves.\n- Continuously monitoring the enemy snake's position and maintaining distance to avoid being cornered or facing potential threats.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nNavigating down to (1, 8) is my decision, as it opens more avenues for future turns and creates a strategic advantage towards accessing apples.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

It also keeps me in a better position to navigate around enemy snakes.\n- The movement RIGHT could risk getting trapped or move me away from future apple strategies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter weighing the options, I decide that moving UP to (7, 2) is preferable.
