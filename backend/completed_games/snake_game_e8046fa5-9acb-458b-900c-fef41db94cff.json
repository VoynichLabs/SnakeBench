At that point, I should focus on getting closer to the next nearest apples, which are (8, 2), (6, 9), and (4, 7). I should prioritize based on distance from my current position.\n\nIf I'm still in the vicinity of the apple at (9, 0), the next nearest apple is (8, 2), and it's 4 steps in the right direction.
