It cannot move UP to (0, 4) (body collision) or LEFT to (-1, 3) (wall collision).\n\nLet's check for head-to-head collisions or collisions with the enemy body.\n- My move UP to (1, 7): This square is not occupied by the enemy's head (0, 3) or body (0, 4), and it is not a possible next head position for the enemy (0, 2) or (1, 3). Safe.\n- My move DOWN to (1, 5): This square is not occupied by the enemy's head (0, 3) or body (0, 4), and it is not a possible next head position for the enemy (0, 2) or (1, 3). Safe.\n- My move LEFT to (0, 6): This square is not occupied by the enemy's head (0, 3) or body (0, 4), and it is not a possible next head position for the enemy (0, 2) or (1, 3). Safe.\n- My move RIGHT to (2, 6): This square is not occupied by the enemy's head (0, 3) or body (0, 4), and it is not a possible next head position for the enemy (0, 2) or (1, 3). Safe.\n\nAll my possible moves are safe this turn. Now I evaluate them based on proximity to apples and strategic positioning.\n\nThe nearest apple is at (6, 6). My current distance to it is |6-1| + |6-6| = 5.\n- Moving UP to (1, 7): Distance to (6, 6) is |6-1| + |6-7| = 5 + 1 = 6. (Further)\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 5): Distance to (6, 6) is |6-1| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6. (Further)\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 6): Distance to (6, 6) is |6-0| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6. (Further)\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 6): Distance to (6, 6) is |6-2| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4. (Closer)\n\nMoving RIGHT brings me closest to the nearest apple. It also continues my movement towards the right side of the board, where the majority of the apples are located. This also takes me further away from the left side of the board where the enemy snake is currently positioned, reducing the likelihood of immediate conflict in the near future.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I will be at (2, 6). The enemy will be at either (0, 2) or (1, 3). I will continue to assess the enemy's position and prioritize safe moves that move me towards the apples on the right side of the board, such as (6, 6), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 7), or (8, 9).\n\nRIGHT"
