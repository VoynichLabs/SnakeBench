No immediate deaths. Now let\u2019s break down options:\n\n- UP -> (1,2): Safe. Keeps lots of escape routes (L/R/U), moves us toward the center and toward nearby apples (notably (2,3) in a few moves). Also inches us up the board so we can pressure Snake #0 from below if he drops south. Best balance of aggression + flexibility. \u2705\n\n- DOWN -> (1,0): Safe. But hugs the bottom edge and reduces future maneuvering room. Less aggressive and easier to get boxed if we commit to bottom. \u274c for right now.\n\n- LEFT -> (0,1): Safe. Puts us on the left wall near (0,4) apple eventually, but immediately reduces escape options (wall at x=0). Too passive early. \u274c\n\n- RIGHT -> (2,1): Safe. Moves closer in x to the opponent (who\u2019s at (2,7)), but doesn\u2019t help us gain vertical control. Fine move but slightly less flexible than UP. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nTactical read: Both snakes are single-segment right now \u2014 that means head-on equals mutual KO. We\u2019re tied 0\u20130, so we should avoid suicidal head-on until we have the lead. Get to the center/top area, grab apples, then force collisions when we have the edge. For turn 1 we want to keep options open and move toward reachable apples and the opponent\u2019s general area.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Push UP to claim vertical space and approach (2,3) apple in ~3 turns.\n- Keep lateral options open; if opponent drifts down, pivot to trap him against the wall.\n- Avoid committing to the bottom or left walls early \u2014 we want to be the one boxing him in, not the one boxed.\n\nAlright fans, time to take the initiative \u2014 we go UP and start the climb! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",
