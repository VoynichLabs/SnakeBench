The apple at (4,7) is in the same row (y = 7) and can be reached by moving left, and the apple at (6,6) is also nearby if I head in that direction.\n\n\u2022 The enemy snake (#0) is at (7,8), which is immediately above and to the left of me. Moving upward might not be best since (8,8) is close to that enemy, so I\u2019ll avoid any move that might put me in a risky position relative to it.\n\n\u2022 By moving LEFT from (8,7), I go to (7,7) \u2013 a safe cell that puts me on a clear path toward the apple at (4,7), with room to navigate and avoid the enemy snake.\n\nThus, my decision for the next move is: LEFT."

If we choose to go DOWN into (7,7), we\u2019ll be directly adjacent to that enemy. There\u2019s a risk the enemy might also head toward that cell, which could lead to a head-on collision. By moving LEFT instead, we move to (6,8), which puts us safely on the way to (6,6) while staying clear of the enemy snake\u2019s immediate vicinity.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n1. Move LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8).\n2. On the following turn, head DOWN to (6,7), and then DOWN again to grab the apple at (6,6).\n\nThis approach minimizes interaction with the enemy snake and efficiently heads toward the closest apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
