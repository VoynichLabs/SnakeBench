My priority will be to stay flexible in my future movements and ensure I don\u2019t move into corners where I could be trapped.\n- I must keep a close eye on Snake #0 and decide on moves that would put me at a safe distance from enemy engagement.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

Hence, I need to strategically decide my next move to take the most advantageous path and not risk collision.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Moving down to (9, 4) doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n2. Moving left to (8, 5) also doesn't help me advance toward an apple. \n3. Moving up to (9, 6) would just move me further from all apples.\n4. Moving down directly to (9, 4) or (9, 3) would not be strategic as (9, 1) is further down.\n\nSince the enemy snake is not a threat in the next immediate move, the best immediate move is to go down to (9, 4) which brings me closer in line with the apple at (9, 1). If I can safely get below (9, 5), I can then explore the path to collect the mentioned apples.\n\nThus the best move is:\nDOWN\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"

This action increases my score and keeps the gameplay momentum going in a positive direction.\n   - After occupying (8, 1), I'll be at (8, 1), with my tail likely around (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), meaning I\u2019ll have further options for movement in subsequent turns.\n\n2. **Retrieving the Apple:**\n   - Moving to (8, 1) means I can eat the apple located there, contributing to my score.\n   - This also positions me well for potential next moves as I can:\n     - Consider DOWNwards to (8, 0) for an empty space (if necessary in the future)\n     - OR continue exploring further upwards or left depending on my enemy snake's movements as well.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Observation:**\n   - I perceive Snake #0 at (6, 8), which is two blocks above my current path. Moving to (8, 1) keeps me distanced from any immediate interactions or threats from Snake #0.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1.

            "rationale": "Given the current position of my snake at (8, 2) and the body structure, my next potential moves are as follows:\n\n### Possible Moves from (8, 2):\n1. **UP to (8, 3)**: This cell is empty. No apples in that direction, and it keeps me safely on the board.\n2. **DOWN to (8, 1)**: This cell is also empty, and moving here keeps me flexible. \n3. **LEFT to (7, 2)**: This cell is empty as well and does not directly lead me to any apples nearby.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 2)**: This cell contains my previous position, which means I cannot move back to this spot.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n- **Moving UP to (8, 3)**:\n  - Although it does not lead towards an apple, it keeps me in the upper section away from threat and opens future potential moves.\n\n- **Moving DOWN to (8, 1)**:\n  - This is also a good option as it does not lead me into danger and could potentially position me well for future moves towards (8, 0) where an apple is located.\n\n- **Moving LEFT to (7, 2)**:\n  - While this keeps my options open, there are no nearby apples. However, it does allow maneuverability in the long run.\n\nAfter weighing my options, moving **DOWN to (8, 1)** seems to be the best move since I can then easily navigate towards the apple at (8, 0) on my next turn, ensuring I'm not trapped and keeping a good position relative to both apples and the enemy snake.\n\nThe strategy for next turn:\n- My immediate goal is to reach (8, 0) where an apple is located. I need to keep aware of the enemy snake's movements and avoid areas that might become risky in the next couple of moves. \n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
