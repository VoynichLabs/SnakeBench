No bodies on the field yet, so main risks are just walls and setting up bad future positions.\n\nLet\u2019s check all four moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (5,5)**  \n  - Safe, inside board, no bodies, no apples.  \n  - Keeps us central, lots of future options.  \n  - Doesn\u2019t grow us, doesn\u2019t pressure the enemy immediately.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,3)**  \n  - There\u2019s an apple at (5,3) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Safe: no bodies, inside board.  \n  - We **grow to length 2**, body becomes: head (5,3) \u2192 tail (5,4).  \n  - Next turn from (5,3) we\u2019ll have **3 safe adjacent options** (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), only UP is blocked because that\u2019s our own body. That\u2019s still a very open position in the center.  \n  - Also steps us a bit closer vertically toward the enemy at y=2, keeping us in the central fight for space.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,4)**  \n  - Safe, no apple.  \n  - Slightly more left, still central, but no growth.  \n  - Less value than DOWN since DOWN gives us length and control for free.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)**  \n  - Safe, no apple.  \n  - Moves us slightly toward the enemy\u2019s x=7, but again, no growth.  \n  - We\u2019d rather meet him as the **bigger snake** than as a mirror.\n\nNo possible **head-on collision** with any of these this turn \u2014 he\u2019s too far away to land on our new square. So the real question is: do we want tempo and size, or just float around?  \n\nWe\u2019re trying to **dominate the board** and eventually **bully him into a bad lane**. Early game, that means:  \n- Grab **free apples** when they don\u2019t compromise safety.  \n- Stay **central** with multiple escape routes.  \n- Start building size so later we can **threaten head-ons** from a position of strength.\n\nDOWN to (5,3) checks all those boxes:  \n- Instant growth \u2705  \n- Central lane \u2705  \n- Multiple future options \u2705  \n- Moves us a bit closer to contest the lower-middle where he\u2019s hanging out \u2705  \n\nLong-term micro-plan for the next few turns (note to future me):  \n- Use the extra length to play more **aggressively in center**, especially around columns 4\u20137 and rows 2\u20136.  \n- Aim to keep our body between him and big apple clusters so he has to route around us.  \n- If we get a lead in apples, start **angling lines** that might force a future head-on where we\u2019re longer.  \n- Avoid drifting too close to edges early; we want room to form walls *around* him, not box ourselves.\n\nWe take the free value and start scaling.

Dead even. This is where we start sculpting the board.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom (5,3):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (5,4)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own body AND directly backwards.  \n  - Rules: moving backwards into your own body = instant death \u2620\ufe0f  \n  - **Illegal.

UP is banned (backwards).  \n  - Keeps us central and a bit closer vertically to the enemy at y=1.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,3)**  \n  - There *is* an apple at (4,3) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Safe this turn.  \n  - New body after growth: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] length 3.  \n  - Next turn: can go UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3).  \n  - **BUT** we cannot go RIGHT (backwards into (5,3)), which means we\u2019re forced to drift AWAY from the enemy for at least a turn.  \n  - We\u2019d stay the same size as him only if he also eats. If he goes right to (8,1), he also grows; no size edge gained, but we give up direct pressure.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)**  \n  - On-board, empty, no apple.  \n  - Safe this turn.  \n  - New body: [(6,3), (5,3)].  \n  - Next turn options: UP (6,4), RIGHT (7,3), DOWN (6,2). LEFT is backwards into (5,3).  \n  - This moves us **toward** the enemy\u2019s side and toward the right-side apple cluster (notably (8,3)).\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Anticipate the enemy\n\nEnemy at (7,1) with tail at (7,2):\n\nTheir options:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,2): straight into their own body = suicide. Probably not.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,0): safe, no apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,1): safe, no apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,1): **apple**, very juicy for them.  \n\nMost dangerous/likely line:  \n- They go **RIGHT to (8,1)** and grow to length 3.  \n- If we don\u2019t eat this turn and go LEFT for the apple, we drift away and also lock out an immediate move back toward them (can\u2019t go RIGHT from (4,3)).  \n- If we don\u2019t eat and instead go **RIGHT to (6,3)**, we\u2019re slightly smaller next turn but we\u2019re **much better positioned** to contest the right side and eventually box them near the bottom-right corner.\n\nRemember the brief:  \n> Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.  \n\nThat means we **don\u2019t** blindly grab every apple\u2014we grab the apples that support pressure. The apple at (4,3) pulls us away and restricts our pathing back toward him on the very next turn. That\u2019s fake value.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the safe moves\n\n**DOWN (5,2):**  \n- Safe, keeps us central.  \n- Slight vertical pressure toward him.  \n- Good flexibility, but doesn\u2019t advance us toward the dominant right-side lane or any quick apple on his side.  \n- Slower access to (8,3).\n\n**LEFT (4,3, apple):**  \n- Keeps size parity *if* he eats this turn.  \n- But forces us to move **away** from him next turn (no RIGHT allowed).  \n- Gives up early influence over the right/bottom-right quadrant where he\u2019s about to play.  \n- Tactical L masked as a snack.\n\n**RIGHT (6,3):**  \n- No apple now, but:  \n  - Puts us **closer horizontally** to the enemy and to his likely route.  \n  - Keeps three strong follow-ups (UP/RIGHT/DOWN).  \n  - Sets us up to contest or grab **(8,3)** soon, which is an apple *on his side of the board*.  \n  - Great staging square for building a future wall between him and the open center.\n\nWe probably let him take an early apple lead this turn, but in exchange we take **spatial control** on his half of the map. That\u2019s how you box a guy in and make him panic later. \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Micro Plan for Future Me (next few turns)\n\n- Prioritize **right-side central control**: hover around columns 6\u20138, rows 2\u20135. That\u2019s our staging ground to cut off his escape routes from the bottom-right.  \n- Avoid early head-on collisions while we\u2019re equal or behind in apples; only look for head-on if/when we get a **clear score lead**.  \n- Look for a timing to snag **(8,3)** or other right-side apples while our body forms a soft wall above/left of wherever he dives for (8,1), (9,1), and (9,0).  \n- Long-term aim: force him down to the **bottom-right corner**, then close the cage from above and the left.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to trade\u2014we\u2019re here to **dominate the map** and then suffocate him.  \n\nRIGHT",

Nice flexibility and we sit **above** him, which is good for boxing.\n\n#### \u2705 DOWN \u2192 (6,2)\n- Empty cell.\n- New snake: `[(6,2), (6,3)]`\n- Still no overlap with any of his immediate moves, so safe *this* turn.\n- But look at the neighborhood:\n  - His body is right there at (7,1) and (7,2).  \n  - Next turn from (6,2): options are (6,1), (5,2), (7,2).  \n  - (7,2) is right on/near his body zone; easy to get squeezed or forced into worse positions.\n- Also moves us **closer vertically** to him while we\u2019re **smaller**. Why give him close-quarters when we\u2019re behind? \ud83e\udd28\n\n#### \u2705 RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)\n- Empty cell.\n- New snake: `[(7,3), (6,3)]`\n- Enemy\u2019s possible heads this turn: (8,2), (8,0), (9,1). None are (7,3). **No instant crash.**\n- After the move:\n  - We sit directly **above his column 7 body** and just left of his head lane.\n  - Next turn options from (7,3): UP (7,4), RIGHT (8,3, apple), DOWN (7,2 \u2013 likely his trail).\n  - Realistically we have at least UP and RIGHT as strong, open options.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the safe moves\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** as candidates.\n\n- **DOWN (6,2)**  \n  - Pulls us toward his cluster at y=0\u20132 while we\u2019re smaller.  \n  - Increases risk of getting tangled in tight space near his body.  \n  - Weak for long-term **boxing**; feels like we\u2019re playing *his* game.\n\n- **UP (6,4)**  \n  - Very safe, very flexible.  \n  - We hold a higher line over midboard, but we\u2019re not leaning into the right-side pressure as hard.  \n  - Slightly more \u201cchill\u201d than I want when the whole plan is to **dominate the right side** and clamp him in the bottom-right.\n\n- **RIGHT (7,3)** \ud83d\ude08  \n  - Pushes deeper into **columns 7\u20138**, exactly where we want to build our wall.  \n  - Sets up a huge follow-up:\n    - If he goes **RIGHT to (9,1)** for the apple (very likely), then next turn we can safely grab **(8,3)** for growth and create a **horizontal barrier** at y=3.\n    - If he surprises us and goes **UP to (8,2)**, we simply *don\u2019t* contest (8,3) next turn\u2014we play UP to (7,4) and keep the high lane. No forced head-on.\n  - Keeps at least **two safe, strong follow-ups** (UP/RIGHT) in basically every branch.\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so we **do not** want a 50/50 head-on race at an apple like (8,3) next turn. But going RIGHT *now* doesn\u2019t force that; it just gives us the **option** to take (8,3) in the lines where it\u2019s safe (especially if he rushes 9,1 or 8,0).\n\nSo what do we want, chat? Sit back and let him own the right side? Or step up and start building the cage we talked about? Exactly. We go RIGHT. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Future-me game plan (next few turns)\n\n- Hold and extend control over **columns 6\u20138, rows 3\u20135**. This is our **containment band** above him.\n- If he dives to **9,1 / 9,0**, look to:  \n  - Safely secure **(8,3)** to grow and form a horizontal wall at y=3, then  \n  - Climb or extend that wall to limit his upward escape.\n- Avoid any head-on collisions until we\u2019re at **apple parity or better**; use our body as a **wall** to make *him* crash into *us* instead of trading heads.\n\nRIGHT",

Eliminate.**\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe2 UP \u2192 (7,4)\n- (7,4) is empty.\n- No way for their head at (9,1) to reach (7,4) this turn \u2192 no head-on.\n- We end as: `[(7,4),(7,3)]` (and we drop (6,3)).\n- Next turn from (7,4) we have 3 options: LEFT (6,4), UP (7,5), RIGHT (8,4).\n- Very flexible, very safe\u2026 but we **don\u2019t grow**, and they likely take the (9,0) apple and go to 4 apples.\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe2 RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (8,3) is an apple, not a body segment.\n- Can their head reach (8,3) this turn from (9,1)?  \n  - UP\u2192(9,2), DOWN\u2192(9,0), LEFT\u2192(8,1), RIGHT\u2192(10,1 off-board).  \n  - **None** of those are (8,3). So **no head-on possible**.\n- Our new snake if we eat: `[(8,3),(7,3),(6,3)]`, apples go to **2**.\n- Enemy branches:\n  - If they go **DOWN** to (9,0) (most likely):  \n    - They go to 4 apples but get forced toward the bottom edge.  \n    - We form a **horizontal wall** at y=3: x=6\u20138 all ours.  \n    - Their next move from (9,0) can\u2019t go UP (backwards) or RIGHT (off-board); they\u2019re basically forced **LEFT along the bottom**, while we dominate mid-right.\n  - If they go **UP** to (9,2):  \n    - Heads end at (8,3) vs (9,2), diagonally adjacent.  \n    - Next turn we\u2019ll have options **UP (8,4)**, **DOWN (8,2)**, **RIGHT (9,3)**.  \n    - From (9,2) they can only go **UP (9,3)** or **LEFT (8,2)** (no backwards/down, no right).  \n    - When we see them at (9,2), we can simply choose **UP to (8,4)** next turn, which avoids any square they can go to. No forced head-on, we stay safe.\n\nSo **RIGHT**:\n- Is 100% safe this turn.\n- Grows us closer to their size.\n- Claims a critical chokepoint row (y=3) for future boxing.\n- Still leaves us safe responses next turn in both of their sane branches (UP or DOWN this turn).\n\nUP is safer but passive; RIGHT is safe **and** aggressive, and we need that if we want to ever flip the apple lead and box this guy.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Future-me game plan (next few turns)\n\n- Take **RIGHT to (8,3)** now, secure the apple and build that **y=3 wall** (x=6\u20138).\n- If enemy dives **DOWN to (9,0)**:\n  - Expect them to be forced **LEFT along the bottom**.\n  - We push **UP and RIGHT** from our new head at (8,3) to dominate columns 7\u20139, rows 3+.\n  - Goal: create a vertical + horizontal cage that keeps them stuck in the lower-left/bottom corridor.\n- If enemy goes **UP to (9,2)**:\n  - Next turn favor **UP from (8,3) to (8,4)** to avoid any head-on and keep the height advantage.\n  - Keep growing on the right side and forcing them to run under us where our body becomes a deadly ceiling they can crash into.\n\nRIGHT",

Backwards into our body = instant death.  \nEliminate.\n\n2) RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)  \nThat\u2019s an apple, nice\u2026 but look at the enemy: from (9,3), their sensible options:\n- UP \u2192 (9,4) (onto the same apple)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,3) (straight into our body = suicide)\n- RIGHT \u2192 off the board (suicide)\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,2) is backwards into their own body, illegal\n\nSo any rational opponent goes UP to (9,4).  \nIf we go RIGHT to (9,4) too, both heads collide on the same square.  \nTie-break: they have 3 apples, we have 2 \u2192 we lose the double KO.  \nSo RIGHT is basically volunteering to lose.\n\n3) LEFT \u2192 (7,4)  \nCheck safety:\n- (7,4) is empty.\n- Enemy cannot reach (7,4) in one move from (9,3).\n- No body collisions, no head-on.\nIf they go UP to (9,4) they just get stronger; if they go LEFT to (8,3) they die on our body.  \nSo LEFT is safe this turn.\n\n4) UP \u2192 (8,5)  \nCheck safety:\n- (8,5) is empty.\n- Enemy from (9,3) can only threaten:  \n  - UP \u2192 (9,4)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,3) (suicide into our body)  \n  - RIGHT off-board (suicide)  \nNone of those touch (8,5), so no collision risk.  \nSo UP is also safe this turn.\n\nSo we\u2019re down to two safe moves: LEFT and UP. Time to think like a predator, not prey.\n\n---\n\nNow think a turn ahead assuming the enemy plays well (UP to (9,4) for the apple):\n\nIf we go LEFT now:\n- After this turn:\n  - Us: head (7,4), body (8,4) \u2192 (8,3)\n  - Them: head (9,4, apple), body (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 (8,1)\n  - Score: us 2, them 4\nWe\u2019re level in height (both y=4), but we\u2019ve given up the chance to climb faster. Getting to those top-right apples like (8,6) will take us longer, and we\u2019re not really blocking them from climbing the right wall.\n\nIf we go UP now:\n- After this turn:\n  - Us: head (8,5), body (8,4) \u2192 (8,3)\n  - Them: head (9,4, apple), body (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 (8,1)\n  - Score: us 2, them 4\nNext turn from here:\n- Our options from (8,5):  \n  - UP \u2192 (8,6) (apple!)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,5)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)\n- Their options from (9,4):  \n  - UP \u2192 (9,5) (forced, because LEFT hits our body at (8,4), DOWN is backwards, RIGHT is off-board)\n\nWe can safely go UP to (8,6) and grab that apple while they are forced UP to (9,5). That:\n- Closes the score gap: 3\u20134 instead of 2\u20134\n- Extends our body vertically in column 8 (8,3 through 8,6)\n- Keeps them pinned to the right wall in column 9\n\nFrom there, they\u2019re stuck going further up the wall while we stay slightly higher and inside, setting up a nasty top-side box later. We maintain interior control (column 8) and height advantage, which is exactly how we eventually trap them against the right edge and ceiling them off.\n\nLEFT is safe but passive; it delays our climb and gives up a nearly guaranteed future apple and positional dominance.  \nUP is safe and actively sets up:\n- A free, safe growth route next turn\n- A strict wall on column 8 keeping them glued to the right side\n- Vertical high ground for future boxing on the top-right quadrant\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so we absolutely cannot take losing head-ons. UP avoids those and sets us up to grow and dominate the upper-right lanes.\n\n---\n\nLong-term plan to future me:\nKeep climbing above the enemy on the right side while anchoring column 8 as a barrier between them and the center. Prioritize grabbing the high apples (like around y=6\u20139) to close the score gap while forcing them straight up the right wall. Once we\u2019re at least tied in apples and have height plus interior control, start looking for a lethal box-in near the top edge or a winning head-on if they try to cut inward.\n\nUP",

Perfect setup for a prison.\n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udde0 STEP 1: Check all four moves from (8,6)\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (8,5)  \nThat\u2019s directly into our own neck. Backwards = instant self-KO.  \n\u274c DOWN is illegal.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (9,6)  \nEnemy from (9,5) has two theoretical moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9,6)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) (into our body)\n\nIf we go RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) and they go UP \u2192 (9,6):\n- Double head-on collision, both die.\n- Apples at that moment: us 3 vs them 4 \u279c THEY win the game.  \nIf they go LEFT, they die on our body and we live\u2026 but we can\u2019t base our game on hoping they hard-int.\n\nThis move hands them a *winning* double-KO option.  \n\u274c RIGHT is a losing gamble.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (7,6)  \n- (7,6) is empty.\n- Enemy from (9,5) can only reach (9,6) or (8,5); they can\u2019t touch (7,6) this turn.\n- Safe now, and we stay clear of head-on risk.\n\nBut there\u2019s a downside: we start peeling away from column 8, weakening the clean vertical wall that\u2019s boxing them against the right side.  \n\u2705 LEFT is safe but less dominant.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP \u2192 (8,7)  \n- (8,7) is empty.\n- Enemy from (9,5) cannot reach (8,7) in one move.\n- No body in that square, no wall, no apple, just clean air.\n\nWhat can enemy do from (9,5)?\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4) is backwards into their own neck \u279c illegal.\n- RIGHT is off-board \u279c death.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) is straight into our body (not the tail), which does *not* move this turn \u279c guaranteed suicide.\n- UP \u2192 (9,6) is the **only** non-suicidal move.\n\nSo realistically:\n- We go UP \u2192 (8,7).\n- They go UP \u2192 (9,6).\nWe extend our vertical wall on x=8; they climb the wall on x=9 with no chance to cut through.  \n\u2705 UP is safe *and* keeps the clamp on.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 LEFT vs \ud83d\udcc8 UP \u2013 which boxes harder?\n\nIf we go LEFT \u2192 (7,6):\n- Our body becomes: head (7,6), then (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,4); tail (8,3) disappears.\n- We move away from being directly left of their head.\n- The \u201cprison wall\u201d on x=8 is shorter near the top, giving them more future wiggle room.\n\nIf we go UP \u2192 (8,7):\n- Our body becomes: (8,7) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,4); tail (8,3) disappears.\n- They *must* go UP to (9,6) or auto-die.\n- Next turns look like this if we keep pressing UP:\n  - We: 8,7 \u2192 8,8 \u2192 8,9 (apple up there for extra length \ud83d\udcaa)\n  - Them: 9,6 \u2192 9,7 \u2192 9,8 \u2192 9,9 (forced all the way into the top-right corner)\n\nOnce we\u2019re at (8,9) and they\u2019re at (9,8), we can slide LEFT along the top row instead of stepping into 9,9. That:\n- Keeps our wall at x=8.\n- Occupies the top row to their left.\n- Leaves them literally with *no* legal moves that aren\u2019t suicide or off-board. That\u2019s a clean box and a guaranteed future death for them while we roam free.\n\nSo:\n- LEFT now = safe but loosens the vise.\n- UP now = safe and *tightens the chokehold* toward a forced trap in the top-right.\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so we do NOT want a losing double-KO. We want a long snake and a suffocating box. UP gives us exactly that path.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udccc PLAN FOR FUTURE ME (NEXT FEW TURNS)\n- Keep riding column 8 upward: go UP again to stack a tall vertical wall between them (x=9) and the center.\n- March them up the right wall: every time they could go LEFT, it\u2019s into our non-tail body, so they\u2019re effectively forced UP.\n- Grab the apple at (8,9) on the way for extra length and stronger coverage.\n- Once they\u2019re in the top-right (9,9) and we control (8,9) and top row to the left, they\u2019ll have no safe moves. That\u2019s the box. Do *not* step into head-on ties unless we\u2019re okay with a draw.\n\nUP",

Perfect setup to funnel him into the top-right coffin.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (8,7)\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (8,6)**  \n- That\u2019s straight into our own neck. Backwards move.  \n- Instant self-KO.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Illegal / suicidal, discard.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)**  \nWe have to consider where he can go from (9,6):\n\nFrom enemy head (9,6):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,6): off-board \u2192 death.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6): into our body segment (not tail) \u2192 death.\n- UP \u2192 (9,7): the only legal, non-suicidal move.\n\nSo if we go RIGHT to (9,7), he is **forced** to go UP to (9,7) as well. That\u2019s:\n- Head-on collision on (9,7).\n- Both die.\n- Apples: us 3 vs them 4 \u2192 they win the tiebreak.\n\nWe literally hand him a forced winning double KO if we go RIGHT.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT is absolutely off the table.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n- (7,7) is empty.\n- Enemy can only reach (9,7) or suicide; they can\u2019t touch (7,7) this turn.\n- So LEFT is safe *this* move.\n\nBut strategically?\n- We move away from column 8, breaking the tight wall that\u2019s fencing him in.\n- Our vertical \u201cbarrier\u201d between center and the right wall gets weaker.\n- That gives him more long-term escape chances when our tail eventually vacates squares like (8,7).\n\nSafe now, but it loosens the clamp we\u2019re building.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f LEFT is safe but strategically weaker.\n\n**UP \u2192 (8,8)**  \n- (8,8) is empty.\n- Enemy from (9,6) cannot reach (8,8) in one step.\n- No self-collision, no wall, no body, no head-on.\n\nAnd we already saw:\n- From (9,6), the enemy\u2019s **only** legal non-suicidal move is UP \u2192 (9,7).\n\nSo if we go UP:\n- We go to (8,8).\n- He goes to (9,7).\n- We extend our vertical wall on x = 8.\n- He continues to be glued to the right wall, one column to the right, with zero ability to cut through our body.\n\nThis keeps the box tightening, exactly the game plan we laid out last turn.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f UP is safe and strengthens the trap.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Future shape if we go UP (the box plan)\n\nLet\u2019s peek a couple moves ahead to see why UP is nasty for him:\n\nAfter **this turn** if we choose UP:\n- Us: head (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) (tail (8,4) disappears)\n- Them: head (9,7) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) (tail (9,2) disappears)\n\nNext turn from there:\n- We can go UP again to (8,9) and grab the apple, growing to 4 apples and length 5.\n- Enemy is forced to go UP from (9,7) to (9,8) (all other directions are death/illegal).\n\nThen:\n- We at (8,9), he at (9,8), we\u2019re now equal in score (4\u20134).\n- From there, he is forced into the corner (9,9).\n- At that moment, we will have a choice:\n  - Step RIGHT into (9,9) for a head-on draw (4\u20134).\n  - Or better: slide LEFT along the top row, leaving him sealed in the corner with **no legal moves that don\u2019t kill him**.\n\nIf we choose the smart line (turning LEFT on the top instead of ramming):\n- He will eventually be forced to crash into our body or the wall while we stay alive.\n- That is a clean, solo win.\n\nAll of that only works cleanly if we keep reinforcing the column-8 wall now, instead of drifting left and giving him breathing room.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term note to future me\n\n- This turn: go UP to (8,8) to keep him pinned to x=9.\n- Next turn, strongly favor continuing UP to (8,9) to grab the apple, equalize the score, and extend the wall.\n- Once we\u2019re at (8,9) and he\u2019s at (9,8), let him get pushed into (9,9) while we step LEFT along the top row, not into a head-on.\n- Maintain body control on columns 7\u20138 so he never escapes left; force him into a situation where every move is suicide while we remain safe.\n\nWe\u2019re not racing apples; we\u2019re building a prison.\n\nUP",

Instant self-kill.  \n\u2192 Eliminated.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \nCheck enemy options from (9,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (9,8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) (backwards into neck, illegal/death)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) (into our body, suicide)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,7) off-board, suicide  \n\nSo his *only* real move is UP \u2192 (9,8).  \nIf we go RIGHT to (9,8), he also goes UP to (9,8) \u2192 head-on collision.  \nDouble KO at apples: us 3 vs them 4 \u2192 **we lose the game**.  \n\u2192 RIGHT is losing, hard no.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \nWe move to an empty square, don\u2019t eat, tail at (8,5) moves up and disappears.  \n- New us: (7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6)  \n- Enemy still forced UP to (9,8).  \n\nSafe this turn, but:\n- We lose the solid x=8 wall from 5\u21929 (gap opens at (8,5)).  \n- We stay behind on apples (3\u20134).  \n- Still trapping him, but not as cleanly, and we miss a free apple.\n\nSo LEFT is safe but strictly weaker than UP.\n\n**UP \u2192 (8,9)**  \nWe step onto an apple and grow.  \n- This turn we eat, so tail at (8,5) does NOT move.  \n- New us: head (8,9), then (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5). Full vertical wall x=8 from y=5 to y=9.  \nEnemy from (9,7) is still in the same bind:\n- Only sane move: UP \u2192 (9,8).  \n\nAfter moves:  \n- Our head (8,9) vs enemy head (9,8): no collision.  \n- No head into body collisions either.  \n- Apples become: us 4, them 4 \u2192 we equalize score and we\u2019re huge on space control.\n\nThis keeps him glued to the right wall and tightens the box.\n\n\u2192 UP is safe, gains an apple, and maximizes the trap. That\u2019s the play.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Short future plan (for next few turns)\n\nAfter we go UP now:\n\n- Position will be:\n  - Us: head (8,9), body (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5), apples 4.\n  - Them: head (9,8), body (9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4), apples 4.\n\nNext turn from there:\n- Our only safe moves: LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9).\n- From his head (9,8), his only safe move is UP \u2192 (9,9).\n\nSo:\n- If we go RIGHT to (9,9): head-on with him at (9,9), double KO at 4\u20134 \u2192 **draw**.\n- If we go LEFT to (7,9): \n  - He\u2019s forced UP to (9,9).\n  - On the following turn, he will have **no legal non-suicidal moves** (every move from (9,9) is wall or our body).\n  - We\u2019ll be free on the top row to pivot LEFT or DOWN safely while he\u2019s doomed.\n\nStrategy note to future me:\n- This turn: go UP to (8,9) to equalize apples and reinforce the x=8 wall.\n- Next turn from (8,9): do NOT go RIGHT; go LEFT to (7,9) to seal him into the (9,9) coffin.\n- Maintain a solid body fence at x=8 so he can never escape left; force him into a mandatory crash while we stay alive.\n\nUP",

Instant death. \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8,9)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck (backwards). Hitting ourselves = death. \u274c\n\nSo only real candidates: **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate DOWN vs LEFT, factoring HIS moves\n\nEnemy from (9,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,10): off-board \u2192 dies \u2620\ufe0f  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,9): off-board \u2192 dies \u2620\ufe0f  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8): straight backwards into own neck \u2192 dies \u2620\ufe0f  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9): that\u2019s **our body** \u2192 he dies \u2620\ufe0f\n\nNo matter what he does, he dies this turn. The only question: do WE stay safe?\n\n#### Option A: DOWN \u2192 (7,8)\n\n- Target (7,8) is empty.\n- We don\u2019t hit our own body or his.\n- We don\u2019t share a cell with his head on any of his moves (he can\u2019t reach (7,8) in one step).\n- Length stays the same, tail at (8,5) moves up, but crucially:\n  - Our body after move: (7,8),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6).\n  - (8,9) **remains our body**.\n- If he goes LEFT into (8,9), he still slams into our body and dies. We live, we win.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT \u2192 (6,9) (APPLE TIME \ud83c\udf4e)\n\n- Target (6,9) has an apple.\n- Safe: on-board, not our body, not his body.\n- We grow, tail **does not** move:\n  - New body: (6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5).\n  - Again, (8,9) is **still our body**.\n- Enemy LEFT to (8,9) = runs straight into our wall and dies.\n- Any other enemy direction = off-board/backwards, also dies.\n- We stay alive, +1 apple \u2192 6 vs his 4. But he\u2019s dead anyway, so\u2026 GG.\n\nConclusion:  \n- **Both DOWN and LEFT keep us alive while he dies 100% this turn.**  \n- LEFT also grabs an apple and keeps the wall fat and nasty. Why not flex while we win? \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Plan to future me (if somehow the game isn\u2019t over)\n\n- Maintain that x=8/x=7 wall and keep pushing inward, prioritizing center control over risky chases.\n- Avoid moving backwards into our own spine (no RIGHT from 6\u20137 on the top lane).\n- Use our length to carve big safe loops and keep any future opponent squeezed to edges for easy box-ins.\n\nLEFT",
