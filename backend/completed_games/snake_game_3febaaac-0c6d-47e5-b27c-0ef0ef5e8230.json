This means the enemy is moving down and is blocking the top-right section of the board.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the snake to (2, 6). This move is safe but far from the closest apple, and it would avoid the direct threat from the enemy.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the snake to (4, 6). This is closer to the closest apple but still requires a move to the left.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the snake to (3, 5). This is closer to the apple at (2, 3) but requires navigating the enemy's path.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- Moving up is the safest option as it avoids immediate danger and takes you closer to the apple.\n- Moving down or left would be riskier as it could lead to potential intersections or direct conflict with the enemy.\n\n### Decision:\nUP\n\nUP",
