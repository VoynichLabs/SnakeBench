The enemy head is far away at (8,9) and cannot contest this turn.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: \n- If you can safely eat (8,4) by moving UP from (8,3) next turn, do so to gain an extra apple and grow. \n- After that, reassess toward any other available apples (e.g., (7,9) or (1,8)) while avoiding getting boxed in by walls or the enemy.\n- Avoid risky head-on collisions and try to maintain multiple escape options.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (7,9) is in the same general direction (toward the top-right region) as moving LEFT now would set you up for, whereas going DOWN would keep you in a lower region with less immediate apple payoff.\n- The enemy snake #0 is far left and not likely to trap you with a quick head-on collision on this turn. Moving LEFT doesn\u2019t create an immediate risk of colliding with it.\n- Choosing LEFT keeps multiple future escape options open and gradually bends your path toward the high-value area near (7,9). DOWN would be a weaker commitment toward any nearby apple and could limit your maneuverability in the crowded mid-board region.\n\nPlan:\n- Move LEFT to (8,4). On subsequent turns, push toward the top-right apple at (7,9) by continuing left to (7,4) and then climbing upward in a controlled manner, while watching for potential blocks or collisions with your own body or enemy moves. If an apple becomes available sooner in your vicinity (e.g., (3,3) or (1,4)), reassess and adjust path to maximize safety and growth.\n\nLEFT",

Up would hit your neck, so UP is unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (2,5) is safe, but keeps you away from the left-side apples.\n- DOWN to (1,4) is safe and sets up reaching (0,4) soon.\n- LEFT to (0,5) is safe and positions you to eat the left-side apple (0,4) on the next turn; from (0,5) the only safe follow-up is DOWN to (0,4) to grab the apple, while UP would hit your neck and RIGHT would backtrack.\n\nDecision:\n- LEFT\n\nPlan:\n- Move LEFT this turn to (0,5). On the following turn, go DOWN to (0,4) to eat the left-side apple, then continue toward (0,3) if safe, while avoiding collisions with enemy #0 and not trapping yourself.\n\nLEFT",
