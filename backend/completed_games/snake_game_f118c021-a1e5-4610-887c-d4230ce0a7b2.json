Slightly further from (9, 1).\n- DOWN: Move to (7, 0), which doesn't progress towards apples and puts me near the bottom edge.\n- LEFT: Move to (6, 1), which doesn't get me any closer to apples.\n- RIGHT: Move to (8, 1), which brings me closer to an apple at (9, 1).\n\nStrategically, the best move is to head towards the apple at (9, 1). This is the closest apple and the quickest way to gain a point. There is no immediate threat from Snake #0 based on its current position.\n\nDecision for this turn:\nRIGHT"
