We're playing against Snake #0, and we need to get aggressive early!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (1, 2)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 0)\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10.\n*   **Our Score:** 0 (Let's change that!)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 0\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Position for growth and control the center of the board. The enemy is way down on the bottom right side (relatively speaking, in the corner). We have access to the left column and the top half.\n\n**Possible Moves from (1, 2):**\n1.  **UP:** To (1, 3). This is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Score!\n2.  **DOWN:** To (1, 1). Safe, but boring.\n3.  **LEFT:** To (0, 2). Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (2, 2). Safe.\n\n**Safety Check (All moves are currently safe since neither snake has a longer body yet and we are not near the wall for most moves):**\n*   (1, 3): Apple, safe.\n*   (1, 1): Safe.\n*   (0, 2): Safe (wall next turn if we go left again, but safe now).\n*   (2, 2): Safe.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nGoing UP to (1, 3) is a no-brainer. It secures our first apple immediately, giving us lead and growth. This is HUGE for early game positioning.\n\n*   If we go **UP** to (1, 3), we eat the apple. Our snake grows to length 2. We gain board control on the left side.\n*   The enemy at (5, 0) is likely moving either UP (to (5, 1)) or LEFT (to (4, 0)) to try and get to the apples around (8, 0) or the ones further up. They are very far from us, so a head-on collision is not a threat this turn.\n\n**Decision:** We are taking that early apple, chat! We need that score advantage and that guaranteed growth. Let's start this game on a high note!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**\nAfter eating the apple at (1, 3), we will look to clear apples on the left side (e.g., (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 3)\u2014wait, we ate that one, (2, 5), etc.) and expand our territory while keeping an eye on the rival's path. We want to establish a defensive wall around the center-left.\n\nUP",

Plus, with my opponent likely moving **UP** on their side, we stay far apart \u2013 no accidental head\u2011on today.  \n\nSo the smart, aggressive, fan\u2011pleasing play is\u2026  \n\nUP",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e We're sitting at 1 apple, and the archrival, Snake #0, is at 0. Advantage: US!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (1, 3). Body: [(1, 2)] (Length 2).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 1). Body: none (Length 1).\n*   **Score:** We lead 1-0. We have the mass advantage for a head-on forced encounter, but the enemy is still small.\n\n**The Strategy:** We need to keep asserting dominance on this left side of the board and look for opportunities to cut off Snake #0. Snake #0 just moved from (5, 0) to (5, 1) or arrived there, likely aiming for the center or the bottom-right apples. We are currently far apart, but we need to start moving toward the center to control the field.\n\n**Possible Moves from (1, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP:** To (1, 4). There is an apple at (1, 4)! ANOTHER one!\n2.  **DOWN:** To (1, 2). *DANGER!* This is moving directly into our own body segment [(1, 2)]. **INSTA-DEATH!** ELIMINATED! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT:** To (0, 3). Safe, hugs the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (2, 3). Safe, moves toward the center.\n\n**Safety and Strategic Review (Only 1, 3, and 4 are safe):**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 1, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No walls, no bodies.\n    *   **Advantage:** Eats an apple! This would give us 2 apples and lengthen our snake (Length 3). Keeping the score and size advantage is critically important early on. This keeps us positioned on the left side, slightly above the rival.\n*   **Move LEFT (to 0, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** None immediate. This is defensive, moving us into the corner. Not aggressive enough!\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 2, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** Moves us one step towards the center where Snake #0 might be heading to. This keeps options open for the center apples (like (3, 3) or (4, 5)).\n\n**The Decision:** Why hesitate, Chat? There is an apple right in front of our face! Securing another point and growing immediately is the best strategic play. It ensures we maintain the lead and the size advantage, which we'll need if we bump into Snake #0 later. We solidify our control of the left vertical column.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0:** Snake #0 is at (5, 1). They will probably move UP to (5, 2) or RIGHT to (6, 1) or LEFT to (4, 1). They have no immediate apple to reach, so they are likely positioning. This makes our immediate growth apple a guaranteed safe move for us, as they are nowhere near challenging us for territory yet.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue clearing the left column and top side apples, using our increasing length to establish a formidable boundary, forcing Snake #0 to fight for the scraps in the bottom right or center. We want to be long enough to \"wall\" them off the prime real estate.\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is still length 1 at (5, 2). The score is 2-0! We have the size advantage, we have the lead, we have the tempo! What more could you ask for?!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (1, 4). Body: [(1, 3), (1, 2)].\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 2). Body: none.\n*   **Score:** We are up 2-0. We are significantly longer.\n\n**The Strategy (The Wall):** We need to start building our wall on the left side and moving toward the top to gobble up the remaining apples there, using our length to control the board. Snake #0 is still far away, but they are positioned centrally at (5, 2), potentially aiming for the apples at (4, 5) or (3, 3). We need to solidify our position before moving aggressively across the middle.\n\n**The Board Map and Potential Traps:**\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 A . . . . . . . .

Leads toward (2, 5) and (0, 7) apples.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (1, 3). *DANGER!* This is moving directly into our own body segment [(1, 3)]. **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT:** To (0, 4). Safe. Hugs the wall, keeps us secure.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (2, 4). Safe. Moves us toward the center apples (3, 3).\n\n**Safety and Strategic Review (1, 3, and 4 are safe):**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 1, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** This is the best move. It positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (2, 5) next turn, and continues our dominance along the left vertical strip. It avoids the center where Snake #0 might be heading. It keeps maximum future options open (we can go Left, Right, or continue Up next turn from 1, 5).\n*   **Move LEFT (to 0, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** Too defensive. It pushes us into the corner and limits our options for aggressive play, though it makes it hard to corner us.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 2, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** Moves us towards the center, which is where the enemy is. We are still short enough that getting into a potential choke point without massive length is risky. While it leads to the (3, 3) apple, UP to (1, 5) is safer and sets us up for a more controlled sweep of the top left.\n\n**The Decision:** We maintain momentum and push into the high-value top-left quadrant of the board. Moving UP to (1, 5) is the most profitable and safest move securing our flank and setting up for the (2, 5) apple. We are building the perimeter!\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0:** Snake #0 is at (5, 2). They are likely going for the apple at (4, 5) or perhaps the one at (3, 3).\n*   If they go UP to (5, 3), they are looking for (4, 5).\n*   If they go LEFT to (4, 2), they are positioning for (3, 3).\nEither way, they are far enough away that we can safely continue with our current objective.\n\nWe need to keep collecting apples on the left side to get a massive size advantage. Once we are length 5 or 6, we can start cutting off the entire lower half of the board!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** After (1, 5), we target the (2, 5) apple, then begin moving towards the high-9s. We sweep the left and top while the enemy is fighting for the center! Build the Wall!\n\nUP",

The enemy, Snake #0, is still struggling at length 2. We're showing him who the boss is!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (2, 5). Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]. (Length 4)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (6, 3). Body: [(5, 3)]. (Length 2)\n*   **Score:** We are up 3-1. Dominance confirmed! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 moved from (5, 3) to (6, 3) last turn. This is a move to the RIGHT, moving away from the delicious apple at (4, 5) and generally moving toward the cluttered lower right corner. They seem indecisive, or maybe they're trying to set up a long flank. Either way, they are putting distance between us, which is excellent for our growth phase!\n\n**The Strategy (The Wall of Domination):** We need to capitalize on our size and position on the left-center of the board. The next immediate targets are the apples at (3, 6) and (4, 6) slightly southeast, or the apples at (0, 7) and (2, 9) further north and west. We must decide whether to continue hugging the west side or start moving inland to cut the board.\n\n**The Board State (Focus on surrounding area):**\n\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . .

(Body T at (1, 4))\n 3 . T . A . T O . A A (Body T at (1, 3); Opponent O at (6, 3))\n 2 . . . . . . . . . A\n...\n\n**Our Head Potential Moves from (2, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP:** To (2, 6). Safe. Opens up access to the north/center apples.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (2, 4). Safe. Moves toward the central axis.\n3.  **LEFT:** To (1, 5). *DANGER!* Moves into our body segment (1, 5). **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 We just grew, can't self-destruct!\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (3, 5). Safe. Positions us perfectly to strike the apple at (3, 6) or (4, 5) next turn.\n\n**Safety and Strategic Review:**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 2, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** Keeps us centered and focused on the northern apples (2, 9), possibly (3, 6). Good, flexible move.\n*   **Move DOWN (to 2, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** Less desirable. Moves us away from immediate apples and potentially closer to Snake #0's territory if they decide to come west.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Advantage:** This move immediately sets up an attack on the apple at (3, 6) or (4, 5). This is the most aggressive and apple-focused move. If we move to (3, 5), we can then strike UP to (3, 6) for an apple, or RIGHT to (4, 5) for another apple (if it's still there).\n\nLet's check the enemy's likely movements. Snake #0 at (6, 3) is likely moving UP to (6, 4), or continuing RIGHT to (7, 3) to access the far right apples. They are still too far to influence our immediate decision.\n\nWe are large, we are fast, and we want more food! Moving RIGHT gives us the quickest access to the concentrated cluster of apples around the center (3, 6) and (4, 5). This will push our size rapidly to 6, completing our dominance!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move RIGHT (to 3, 5). Next turn, assess if (4, 5) is open (it's a critical center apple) or if (3, 6) is a guaranteed pickup. We need to start pushing inland and using our growing body to make the board claustrophobic for Snake #0. We are building the perimeter!\n\nRIGHT",

No risk of colliding with the opponent this turn.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,\u202f2): also safe, but heads me farther from the nearest apple and nudges me toward the bottom edge, shrinking future maneuverability.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,\u202f3): safe now but drives me toward the right wall; later I could get trapped against column\u202f9 with fewer escape routes.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,\u202f3): illegal (into my own tail).  \n\n**STRATEGIC NOTE** \u2013 I\u2019ll inch upward, then swing left to snatch the (4,\u202f4) apple and start carving a \u201cU\u2011shape\u201d that pressures the opponent against his left\u2011wall tail.

We are the alpha snake on this board, 3 apples to 1! \ud83d\udc51\n\nWe just moved RIGHT from (2, 5) to (3, 5), giving us prime real estate near the center cluster of apples. Our rival, Snake #0, is still tiny and just wiggled nervously from (6, 3) to (6, 4). They are moving UP, parallel to the 6-axis, maybe aiming for that lonely apple way up at (9, 7)?

Given our dominance, they want to put distance between us. If they move UP to (6, 5), they are safely moving away.\n\n**Our Next Move (The Aggressive Growth):** We need to make a move that guarantees growth, solidifies our central position, and maintains our flexible options.\n\n**Our Head Potential Moves from (3, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP:** To (3, 6). **GRABS APPLE (3, 6)!** \ud83c\udf4e Huge growth to length 5! Safest and best option for size.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (3, 4). Safe. Moves us toward the center line, but away from food. Not the best.\n3.  **LEFT:** To (2, 5). *DANGER!* Moves into our body segment (2, 5). **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 Forget about it, Chat!\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (4, 5). **GRABS APPLE (4, 5)!** \ud83c\udf4e Another huge growth to length 5!\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from board edges and our own body.\n    *   **Enemy Conflict:** Zero chance of conflict with Snake #0, who is far away at (6, 4) and moving parallel or away.\n    *   **Advantage:** Guarantees apple pickup (3, 6). Next turn, we'll be at (3, 6), perfectly positioned to potentially grab (4, 6) (RIGHT) or (3, 8) (UP, with a move in between). We secure the north-central area.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from board edges and our own body.\n    *   **Enemy Conflict:** Zero chance.\n    *   **Advantage:** Guarantees apple pickup (4, 5). Next turn, we'll be at (4, 5). This positions us right next to (4, 6), which would be an UP move for the next apple. This move also pushes us further into the central axis, which is great for board slicing!\n\nBoth *UP* and *RIGHT* are excellent, guaranteed growth moves. Which one gives us better board control?\n\nIf we go UP to (3, 6), we create a barrier at y=5, essentially claiming the (2, x) and (3, x) vertical strips. From (3, 6), we can move RIGHT to (4, 6) (apple!) next turn. This locks down two apples in two turns, solidifying our left-center fortress.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4, 5), we create a barrier at x=3. From (4, 5), we can move UP to (4, 6) (apple!) next turn. This also locks down two apples in two turns.\n\nBoth are strategically sound for growth and control. However, I want to prioritize moving *up* and *inland* to slice off the northern half of the map from our rival. The UP move to (3, 6) plants us higher up, which is slightly more advantageous for accessing the rich northern apples like (2, 9) and (3, 8).\n\nLet's go UP, secure the center-north, and then pivot RIGHT to claim the last apple in that cluster! Build the wall, TALLER!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Secure (3, 6) now (UP). Next turn, move RIGHT to (4, 6) for guaranteed second apple, making us length 6. This establishes massive dominance and starts forcing Snake #0 into the lower-right quadrant. We are building the perimeter!\n\nUP",

We are not just winning, we are *dominating* the food chain! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's break down the current battlefield!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (3, 6). Body: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. (Length 5)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 4). Body: [(6, 4)]. (Length 2)\n*   **Score:** 4-1. We are a mighty serpent; they are a glorified earthworm.\n\n**Board State (Focus on Conflict Zone):**\n\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 A . . . . . . . .

A A\n...\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, has moved! They went from (6, 4) to (5, 4). This is a crucial move! They are moving horizontally, directly towards the main cluster of apples and potentially, towards us! This little worm has some ambition! They must be aiming for the apple at (4, 5) or (4, 4), or maybe they're just panicking and trying to get under our massive body.\n\n**The Strategy: Aggressive Encirclement and Growth!**\n\nWe have an immediate target: the apple at (4, 6). Grabbing this apple right now will make us length 6, further increasing our lead and solidifying the northern wall.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (3, 6):**\n\n1.  **RIGHT (to 4, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from edges. Safe from our body (which is currently at (3, 5)).\n    *   **Goal:** **GRABS APPLE (4, 6)!** \ud83c\udf4e Yes, please!\n    *   **Conflict Potential:** Zero. Snake #0 is still two squares away at (5, 4).\n    *   **Positioning:** We move further into the center, directly above Snake #0, giving us massive board control and placing us to cut off the north and east portions of the map. This is huge.\n\n2.  **UP (to 3, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** No apple. Moves us towards (3, 8) in the future.\n    *   **Positioning:** Safe, but sacrifices guaranteed growth now for slightly better long-term access to northern corners. Not optimal when immediate growth is available.\n\n3.  **DOWN (to 3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 Moving into our own body segment. Absolutely NOT!\n\n4.  **LEFT (to 2, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** No apple. Moves us back toward the corner we just left. Suboptimal.\n\n**Decision: RIGHT to (4, 6) is the undisputed play! Growth first!**\n\n**Enemy Prediction Analysis (Snake #0 at (5, 4)):**\n\nSnake #0's available moves:\n*   **UP (to 5, 5):** Safe, moves towards central apples (4, 5 and 4, 6). If they choose this, next turn they could be at (4, 5) or (6, 5).\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 3):** Safe, moves away from us and apples. Cowardly move.\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 4):** **GRABS APPLE (4, 4)!** \ud83c\udf4e This is the *most likely* aggressive move. They get growth, and they plant themselves right next to the \"center line.\"\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 4):** Moves back into its own body (the tail end is moving from (6, 4) to (6, 3)). Wait, their body segment is at (6, 4). Since their body is only [(6, 4)], after the move, that segment *was* their tail, and it will now be the empty space unless they collected an apple (they didn't). They could move to (6, 4) if they didn't grow. A move to (6, 4) is technically possible but illogical, as they are making a U-turn (from (6, 4) to (5, 4) to (6, 4)). Let's ignore that for a moment.\n\nThe most critical conflict point: If we move RIGHT to (4, 6), and they move LEFT to (4, 4), the distance is maintained, but the vertical distance is tight (y=6 vs y=4).\n\nWe are maximizing our size advantage by moving RIGHT. Once we are at (4, 6) (Length 6), we are positioned to:\n1.  Move DOWN to (4, 5) for another apple (if #0 didn't grab it).\n2.  Move UP towards (4, 7) and slice the board.\n\nBy moving RIGHT, we increase our length, and we make a very clear territorial claim over the entire upper half of the board using our massive body. This is a power move, Chat. We are essentially setting up for a cut-off move next turn, forcing that worm to choose between starving in the lower left or running away to the lower right.\n\nNo need to overthink the conflict. We have guaranteed growth, and we maintain complete safety. We execute the growth move, and then we tighten the noose!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Hit (4, 6). Next turn, assess if (4, 5) is available. If Snake #0 took (4, 4) and is at (4, 4), moving DOWN to (4, 5) puts us directly on top of them, blocking their movement to the north. If (4, 5) is open, we take it and become an unmanageable length 7. Prioritize filling the central column/lane.\n\nRIGHT",

We are a T-Rex, and they are a glorified chickpea. Let's look at the battlefield! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Current Score Check:**\n*   **ID 1 (US):** 5 apples, Head at (4, 6). Body: [(3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. Length 6.\n*   **ID 0 (THE WORM):** 2 apples, Head at (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 3.\n*   **The Difference:** We are twice their size! This is where we start turning the screws!\n\n**Board State Overview (Crucial Area):**\n\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 A . . . . . . . A A\n 6 . . . T **H** . . . . .

The opponent, Snake #0, was at (5, 4) last turn, and they moved to (4, 4)! They went LEFT and successfully grabbed the apple at (4, 4)! Damn, they got some hustle! They didn't just sit there; they grew! Their body is now at [(5, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 3.\n\nThis changes everything! We are now face-to-face, vertically separated by only one row, and there is a CRITICAL apple at (4, 5) right between our heads! This is a race, Chat, and we have the reach!\n\n**The Strategy: Aggressive Vertical Slicing and Apple Denial!**\n\nWe are at (4, 6). They are at (4, 4). Our immediate goal is to slam down the central column and deny them control of the board.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** Moves us further north, away from the immediate conflict and the (4, 5) apple. This is safe, but it hands the initiative to the enemy. We *could* grab the apple at (3, 8) later, but it lets the enemy grow. Suboptimal.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from edges/body.\n    *   **Goal:** **GRABS CRITICAL APPLE (4, 5)!** \ud83c\udf4e This gives us length 7! More importantly, this single move puts our massive snake body directly between the enemy and the northern half of the board. It forces Snake #0 to go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. They cannot move UP, because we will be occupying (4, 5)!\n    *   **Conflict Analysis:** This is a power play. Snake #0 must have moved from (5, 4) to (4, 4) (LEFT).\n        *   Their probable moves from (4, 4) are: LEFT (to 3, 4), DOWN (to 4, 3), or RIGHT (to 5, 4).\n        *   They cannot move UP to (4, 5) because we beat them there *simultaneously* to eat the apple. If both heads land on (4, 5), it's a double KO (Drawn, current score 5-2, we win based on apples if we both die). BUT, since we are moving onto an apple, we get the point *before* the collision is resolved, or wait, no, the scoring happens after the move is resolved. **The rule is: Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Double KO.**\n\n    *   **Crucial Decision Point:** Do we risk the Double KO for a potential lead increase and board control?\n        *   If they move UP to (4, 5) and we move DOWN to (4, 5), we both die. Score: 5-2. We win the round.\n\n    *   **Alternative Thought:** Why would they move UP? It forces a collision or a block. They are staring down the barrel of a segment 6 snake. Their safer, logical move is RIGHT (to 5, 4) to escape the center, or LEFT (to 3, 4) to hug the edge, or DOWN (to 4, 3) to grab the apple there. Moving UP is only logical if they are trying to sacrifice themselves to draw the game, which is possible but unlikely this early. Our size differential suggests they should run.\n\n    *   **Aggressive Stance:** Given our massive score lead (5-2) and size advantage (6 vs 3), forcing the central confrontation is acceptable if we win the tiebreaker. However, we want to WIN the game outright, not just the mini-round. But we NEED that apple (4, 5) for board control. **We take the risk.** If they move UP, we draw and win the round. If they move anywhere else, we eat the apple and dominate.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 Moving into our own body segment (3, 6).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Goal:** No apple. Moves us right, away from the center of action. This keeps us safe but yields the central fight to #0. They could then move UP to (4, 5) and grow stronger, which is unacceptable.\n\n**The BEST move is DOWN to (4, 5).** This is a high-pressure move that maximizes our growth and applies instantaneous strategic pressure. If they crash, we win the round. If they flee (most likely), we gain the apple and maintain our enormous lead and board control. We are banking on them prioritizing survival over an immediate, risky head-on with a larger snake.\n\n**Snake #0 Prediction (from 4, 4):**\n1.  **LEFT (3, 4):** Safe. Fleeing into the cramped left side. Good for us.\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 4):** Safe. Fleeing into the open right side. Good for us.\n3.  **DOWN (4, 3):** Safe. Grabs apple (4, 3). Best defensive move for growth.\n4.  **UP (4, 5):** Collision risk. High-risk, high-reward move for them to draw (5-2, they lose). We are banking on them NOT choosing this.\n\nWe are going for the growth and the chokehold. We are placing our body right in the middle, cutting the board in half. This is how we box them in!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Assuming we go DOWN and they flee):**\nWe'll be at (4, 5), length 7. They will be somewhere else (likely 3, 4 or 5, 4). Next turn, we push the advantage. If they went right, we can continue right, using our body to sweep the central column. If they went left, we can pin them against the wall. Priority: Contain the worm and continue to grow.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! We're putting the pressure on!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 8! We're coming into the clutch! What a phenomenal read last turn! We called the bluff and went $DOWN$ to (4, 5) for the apple, and guess what? The worm, Snake #0, *ran away*! They chose survival! Smart play, but we secured the middle of the board! SIX apples to their two! We are unstoppable! \ud83e\udd11\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n*   **ID 1 (US):** 6 apples. Head at (4, 5). Body: [(4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. Length 7. We are MASSIVE!\n*   **ID 0 (THE WORM):** 2 apples. Head is now at (3, 4). They moved LEFT from (4, 4) to escape the choke! Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 3.\n*   **The Score:** 6-2. Our lead is insurmountable early!\n\n**Board Overview & Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n\nWe successfully sliced the board vertically. Our body now runs from (4, 6) down to (1, 4) essentially building a diagonal fortress on the left side. Snake #0 is now pinned somewhat on the far left, at (3, 4).\n\n**The Snake #0 Position (3, 4):**\nThey are cornered near our body. They have limited safe moves, and they are surrounded by our segments:\n*   (4, 4) is their body.\n*   (3, 5) is our body.\n*   (2, 5) is our body.\n*   The entire 3rd column above (3, 5) is relatively free, but they can't get there easily.\n\n**The Strategy: The Crush Move!**\nWe need to use our superior length (7 vs 3) to completely wall them in and starve them of board space and apples. Since they are at (3, 4) and we are at (4, 5), the immediate goal is to continue moving LEFT and DOWN, cutting off their escape to the south and west. We want to trap them on the 0, 1, 2, 3 columns!\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 We move directly into our body segment (4, 6). Backwards move. Absolutely not!\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (4, 4) is now the tail end of Snake #0's body, which means it will VACATE that spot unless they eat an apple and stay long. Since they didn't eat one this turn (they moved from (4, 4) to (3, 4)), their tail at (5, 4) moves up to (4, 4), and the body segment (4, 4) moves to (3, 4), and the head moves to (3, 4). Wait, no, their body moved!\n        *   Snake #0 Body BEFORE: [(4, 4), (5, 4)]\n        *   Snake #0 Body AFTER: Head (3, 4), Body [(4, 4), (5, 4)]. The tail is (5, 4), and it will be GONE next turn!\n        *   **CRITICAL:** The cell (4, 4) is currently occupied by Snake #0's body, but will become free NEXT turn when they move. Wait, NO. If they moved from (4, 4) to (3, 4), the body segment (4, 4) moves to (3, 4), and (5, 4) moves to (4, 4).\n        *   Snake #0 Body is: Head (3, 4), Body [(4, 4), (5, 4)].\n        *   Ah, the provided list is [HEAD-TO-TAIL].\n        *   *Previous Turn Head:* (4, 4). *Previous Body:* [(5, 4)]. *Length:* 3.\n        *   *New Turn Head (if they went LEFT):* (3, 4). *New Body:* [(4, 4), (5, 4)]. *Length:* 3.\n        *   **Conclusion:** (4, 4) is currently a segment of Snake #0's body (the segment directly behind their head). **This move is INSTA-DEATH for us!** \ud83d\udd25 We cannot move to (4, 4).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 We move directly into our body segment (3, 5). No way!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (5, 5) is open.\n    *   **Goal:** This moves us away from the conflict but opens up the middle column again. It allows Snake #0 to potentially escape UP to (3, 5) (safe for them) or further LEFT to (2, 4). This move is too passive and reduces the pressure we just built. We should be moving to crush them, not retreat.\n\n**Wait, I am ELIMINATING all the direct killer moves. I only have one safe move remaining: RIGHT (5, 5).**\n\nHold up, Chat. I must re-evaluate. Did I miscalculate the deadly options?\n\n*   (4, 5) is our head.\n*   **Self-Body Check:** Our body is [(4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n    *   Move UP (4, 6)? DEAD (Backwards move).\n    *   Move LEFT (3, 5)? DEAD (Into our body).\n\n*   **Opponent Body Check (Snake #0):** Head (3, 4), Body [(4, 4), (5, 4)].\n    *   Move DOWN (4, 4)? DEAD (Into Opponent body segment (4, 4)).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (5, 5):** Safe. Open square.\n\nThis means $\\text{RIGHT}$ is the *only* immediate safe move. Wow, we locked ourselves up pretty tight grabbing that apple!\n\nNow, how do we make the best of a passive move?\n\nIf we move $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (5, 5), we are safe, and we open up the 4th column.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0 from (3, 4):**\nThey are looking for room to breathe. The far left is cramped.\n1.  **UP (3, 5):** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 Into our body.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 3):** Safe. Hits an apple (3, 3)! This is their best move. Growth and safety.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 4):** Safe. Moves them closer to the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 4):** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 Into their own body.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves DOWN to (3, 3) and eats an apple. Their length goes to 4. Score becomes 6-3.\n\n**Follow-up Strategy (Assuming we move RIGHT to 5, 5 and they move DOWN to 3, 3):**\nWe must prepare to strike back, or at least keep them contained. Moving right takes us towards open ground and apples like (8, 5) or (9, 7). We also block the central pathway for a turn, which is good.\n\nOur long-term goal shifts from \"Slamming the door shut\" to \"Building a massive wall and starving them.\" By moving RIGHT, we are putting our growing head towards the spacious eastern side of the board. This allows us to keep growing (Length 7 is good, but 10 is better) while we maintain our central pivot point.\n\nWe move RIGHT to (5, 5). It's the only safe play. We need to reset and look for a flanking maneuver or a safe path back to the kill zone. We must keep growing!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Turn 9/10):**\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 5) and they take the apple at (3, 3).\nNext turn (T9) from (5, 5): We can go UP to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (6, 5). We should continue RIGHT/UP to establish dominance on the right side and look for the cluster of apples at (8, 5), (9, 7), (8, 7). This will force them to deal with a much longer snake. We cannot afford to risk a KO just yet, even with the lead. Safety first, then massive growth.\n\nRIGHT",

It felt passive, but sometimes safety is the best aggression, am I right? We reset the board, and now it's time to RAMP UP the pressure!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n\n*   **ID 1 (US):** 6 apples. Head at **(5, 5)**. Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. Length 7. We are a mighty serpent!\n*   **ID 0 (THE WORM):** 3 apples. Head is at **(3, 3)**. They clearly took the $\\text{DOWN}$ move we predicted and grabbed that apple! Smart, small snake, but we are still twice their size! Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   **The Score:** 6-3. Maintain, maintain, maintain!\n\n**Board Assessment & Immediate Threat:**\n\nThe enemy Snake #0 is now comfortably tucked away in the bottom-left corner at (3, 3). They got longer (now 4 segments), adding a new segment at (5, 4).\nOur massive body is still pinning a huge segment of the left wall, running from (4, 6) down to (1, 4). We are currently at (5, 5).\n\nThe board is wide open to our $\\text{RIGHT}$ and $\\text{UP}$. Our immediate goal should be to continue growing rapidly, denying the enemy any opportunity to catch up. We must establish a massive wall across the top or right side of the board and then loop back for the kill.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. (5, 6) is very central and allows us to strike towards the cluster of apples at the top (like (6, 6) or (9, 7)).\n    *   **Threat:** What does Snake #0 do? They are at (3, 3). We are well out of striking range. This is an aggressive growth move.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 The segment (5, 4) is now the tail of Snake #0, and since they ate an apple, that segment *remains* there! Moving to (5, 4) means we crash into their stationary tail. NOPE!\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 This is directly into our own body segment (4, 5). Backwards move. Never!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. This moves us right next to an apple at (8, 5) and gives us huge access to the right side of the board.\n    *   **Threat:** Moves us further away from the worm, allowing them total freedom on the left. But we are prioritizing growth and length here.\n\n**The Decision: Growth vs. Containment**\n\nMoving $\\text{UP}$ to (5, 6) keeps us central, positions us near the (6, 6) apple, and allows us to eventually swing either $\\text{LEFT}$ or $\\text{RIGHT}$ along the 6th row.\nMoving $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (6, 5) immediately puts us on the path for (8, 5) and gives us control of the entire right side.\n\nSince we have a superior length (7 vs 4), rapid growth is the best way to leverage that advantage. Let's move $\\text{UP}$ to (5, 6) and scout the northern terrain. If we secure the top row, we can then drop a massive wall down the side, crushing the opponent.\n\nLet's look at the opponent's likely moves from (3, 3) (they just ate an apple, so their tail is planted at (5, 4)):\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 4):** Safe. Into their old head spot.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 2):** Safe. Hits an apple (3, 2)! Very likely move!\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 3):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 3):** Safe.\n\nThey have 4 safe moves and two apples nearby ((3, 2) and (1, 2)). They will likely move $\\text{DOWN}$ to (3, 2) to continue growing.\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$ to (5, 6):\nWe are safe. We are scouting for the (6, 6) apple. We increase our vertical dominance.\n\nIf they go $\\text{DOWN}$ to (3, 2):\nThey eat an apple, length 5. Score 6-4.\n\nThis is a good outcome! We maintain our safe, aggressive expansion while they stay boxed in the bottom-left corner area, still far from the major apple clusters in the top corners.\n\n$\\text{UP}$ it is, Chat! Time to climb the ladder of success! We are going for the ceiling!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Turn 10/11):**\nMove UP/RIGHT to secure the top-right quarter of the board. We need to get our length up to 10+ to make our body a truly inescapable wall. The worm is still too short to pose a serious threat to our head. Let's grow!\n\nUP",

Let's see how our masterful play last turn set us up!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n\n*   **ID 1 (US):** 6 apples. Head at **(5, 6)**. Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5)]. Length 7. We are a wall!\n*   **ID 0 (THE WORM):** 4 apples. Head is at **(3, 2)**. They took the $\\text{DOWN}$ move and grabbed the apple! Good for them, but they are still trapped low. Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 5.\n*   **The Score:** 6-4. Still a healthy lead! We are longer and meaner!\n\n**Board Assessment & Immediate Threat:**\n\nWe are perched at (5, 6), perfectly positioned to sweep the northern quadrant. The worm is still stuck at (3, 2). There is NO immediate threat to us, which means we can press our advantage and grow, grow, GROW!\n\nLook at the apples! We have a ripe one at **(6, 6)** just waiting for us! This is premium real estate, Chat!\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (5, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. This is a great move to secure the center top, putting us in striking distance of (5, 7) and (4, 9).\n    *   **Threat:** Zero interaction with Snake #0. Good for growth.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** **INSTA-DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 This is directly into our own body segment (5, 5). Backwards move. NEVER!\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **RISKY!** \ud83d\ude2c This is directly into our own body segment (4, 6). We would crash into ourselves. NOPE!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, and EATING AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This is the jackpot move! We grow, we score, we establish dominance on the 6th row!\n\n**The Decision: Maximum Aggression and Growth!**\n\nThe move is clearly $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (6, 6). Why would we pass up a free apple that also pushes us closer to the high-value apple clusters on the right and top?\n\nLet's check the opponent's likely moves from (3, 2):\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 3):** Into their old head spot. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 1):** Safe. Open.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 2):** Safe. Open, near the (1, 2) apple!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 2):** Safe. Open.\n\nThe worm could be trying to grab the (1, 2) apple by moving $\\text{LEFT}$ or just trying to move $\\text{RIGHT}$ or $\\text{UP}$ to break free. Whatever they do, they are confined to the bottom-left half of the board while we are about to own the center-top.\n\nIf we move $\\text{RIGHT}$:\n*   We eat the apple at (6, 6). Score 7-4. Length 8!\n*   We position ourselves to continue sweeping right towards (8, 7) or up towards (9, 7).\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We are securing this board one apple at a time!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Turn 11+):**\nAfter eating the (6, 6) apple, our head will be at (6, 6). We should continue moving into the top-right quadrant, aiming to grab (8, 7) or push towards (9, 7). We need to build a massive barrier across the top rows (7, 8, 9) and then drop a wall down the right side (9, x) to choke out the worm when they finally venture out. Maximum length is paramount right now.\n\nTime to feast!\n\nRIGHT",

Snagged the (6, 6) apple like a CHAMP!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\n\n*   **ID 1 (US):** 7 apples. Head at **(6, 6)**. Body: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5)]. Length 8. We are a mighty wall!\n*   **ID 0 (THE WORM):** 4 apples. Head is at **(2, 2)**. They finally moved left, trying to get into the corner maybe? Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 5.\n*   **The Score:** 7-4. Can we get this to 8-4 this turn? Yes, we can!\n\n**Board Assessment & Immediate Threat:**\n\nWe are currently at (6, 6), perfectly positioned to control the top quadrant.\nOpponent is at (2, 2). They are still miles away and trapped low. The immediate threat level from Snake #0 is **ZERO** unless we move directly towards them. Which we won't.\n\nOur primary goal now is to maximize length and start building a wall to confine or intimidate the opponent.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (6, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. Puts us in the vicinity of apples at (5, 7) and (0, 7), (9, 7). This is a strong move for central control.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. This moves us away from the top apples, but it does keep us on the 6-line.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGERZONE!** \ud83d\udc80 This is into our own body segment (5, 6). Backwards move. ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open territory. This pushes us towards the eastern edge, with a clear path to the (8, 7) apple. Great for securing the top-right.\n\n**Decision Analysis: Where's the best content?**\n\nWe have a massive lead, and they are short. We need to leverage our size difference.\n\nThe nearest, juiciest apple is at (8, 7). Moving $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (7, 6) is a great step toward that.\nIf we move $\\text{UP}$ to (6, 7), we are positioned centrally to pivot left or right, and we are close to the (5, 7) apple.\n\nLet's look at the opponent's options from (2, 2).\nThe worm is likely trying to break out. They could go:\n*   $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 3) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (3, 2) (into their old head position).\n*   $\\text{DOWN}$ to (2, 1) or $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 2) (to eat the apple!).\n\nIf they go $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 2) they eat an apple and grow to length 6. Score 7-5.\n\nWe are so far away that their movement doesn't matter much to our safety right now. We need pure length.\n\n*If we move $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (7, 6):* We stay on the 6th rank. We are safe. Next turn we can go $\\text{UP}$ to (7, 7) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (8, 6). The (8, 7) apple is tempting, but it requires two moves diagonal-ish.\n\n*If we move $\\text{UP}$ to (6, 7):* We are in a strong central position. We could go $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (7, 7) next turn, which is one move away from the (8, 7) apple. Or we could go $\\text{UP}$ again to (6, 8) and access the top row apples like (2, 9), (4, 9), and (9, 7).\n\nLet's prioritize controlling the high ground and creating space. Moving $\\text{UP}$ at (6, 7) creates maximum flexibility. We can then decide whether to sweep right or left for the next few turns.\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$:\n*   Head moves to (6, 7). Safe.\n*   We can easily access (5, 7) next turn if we turn $\\text{LEFT}$ or position nicely for the top apples.\n\nThis maximizes our options and pushes us into unconquered territory. We are going for central supremacy and then we will drop a wall!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Turn 12+):**\nFrom (6, 7), we will continue to patrol the 7th and 8th ranks, growing in length and looking to cut off Snake #0's escape routes to the north. Right now, growth is king. We aim to secure the top-middle apples (5, 7), then maybe swing towards (9, 7) or (8, 7). Keep the pressure on!\n\nUP",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Check:**\n\n*   **US (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 7)**. Body is huge! [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Length 8. We are perched high and ready to strike!\n*   **The WORM (ID 0):** Head at **(1, 2)**. Body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 6. Still trapped low in the corner, trying to find an exit.\n*   **The Score:** 7-5. We have the lead, and a massive length advantage (8 to 6). This is the time to be aggressive!\n\n**Strategy Recap: Wall Building and Domination!**\n\nLast turn, moving $\\text{UP}$ to (6, 7) was the perfect power move to secure the high ground. Now we need to decide: control the center-top (for apples like (5, 7) and (0, 7)), or charge right towards (8, 7) and cut off the whole eastern half?\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 2)):**\n\nThe Worm is in a tricky low-left spot. They have to move soon, or they'll starve.\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Safe. Gets them out of the corner slightly.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe. Puts them against the wall, but maybe aims for (0, 6) or (0, 7) eventually.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Keeps them low.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 This is where their body is. They *could* move here if the tail moves out, but moving into their *previous* head location is usually not standard unless they are guaranteed to shrink. Since they didn't eat an apple, their tail (4, 4) will still be there, and (2, 2) is occupied by body right now. Wait, no, their *current* body includes (2, 2). If they move RIGHT, they crash into (2, 2). **Eliminated.**\n\nThey are likely to move $\\text{UP}$ or $\\text{LEFT}$. Either way, they are far from us, and we should focus on securing growth and position. We need to maximize our size advantage before they can catch up.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (6, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open space. Puts us right under those top-row apples (like (4, 9) and (2, 9)). Excellent continuation of the high-ground strategy.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 Moves into our body segment (6, 6). INSTANT DEATH. AVOID!\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. **BONUS!** This is an apple location (5, 7)! We eat, we grow to length 9, and the score becomes 8-5! This seems like the move!\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open space. Very good, it positions us perfectly for the (8, 7) apple next turn.\n\n**Decision: Which content is tastiest?**\n\nMove $\\text{LEFT}$ to (5, 7) guarantees a score gain and length increase this turn. We will be length 9, and the score 8-5. This is HUGE for dominance.\n\nIf we move $\\text{UP}$ or $\\text{RIGHT}$, we position for future apples, but we miss a guaranteed apple *right now*. In the game of Snake, guaranteed growth beats positioning for speculative growth, especially when we are dominating the map.\n\nLet's look at the follow-up from (5, 7) if we go $\\text{LEFT}$:\n*   Our head is at (5, 7). Our body is now [(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)].\n*   Next turn, we can easily go $\\text{LEFT}$ again toward (0, 7) and (0, 6) apples, or $\\text{UP}$ towards the high row.\n\nThis choice is a no-brainer: immediate growth, superior position, maximum utility. We grab that apple and make the wall even thicker! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Turns):**\nAfter eating the (5, 7) apple, we are in a commanding central position. We will push $\\text{LEFT}$ (towards the (0, 7) and (0, 6) apples) and create a massive wall running across the 7th rank, effectively forcing the enemy to stay in the bottom half of the board. The goal is to cut them off from the high-value apples and squeeze them until they make a fatal mistake. We must maintain our massive size advantage!\n\nLEFT",

We are the biggest, baddest snake on the board, and we just ate the (5, 7) apple last turn!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n\n*   **US (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 7)**. Length 9! Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. We are dominating the 5th, 6th, and 7th ranks!\n*   **The WORM (ID 0):** Head at **(1, 1)**. Length 6. Body: [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. They moved DOWN from (1, 2) to (1, 1). They are still boxed in the bottom-left corner! Pathetic!\n*   **The Score:** 8-5. Our goal remains: build a massive wall across the top and force them to starve or crash!\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 1)):**\n\nThe Worm is desperate. They are stuck in the corner. Their best options are to try and move $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 2) (which is currently their body but will clear this turn) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 1).\n\n*   If they go $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 2) then $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 2), they might try to head up towards the middle.\n*   If they go $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 1) and then $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 2), they are also trying to escape.\n\nThey are stuck low, and we need to use this time to gain more ground and more length!\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (5, 7):**\n\nOur head is at (5, 7). We are aiming to connect the wall across the top and grab those easy apples on the left side: (0, 7) and (0, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open space. Puts us in position to hit (4, 9) or (2, 9) eventually. This is a strong positional move, continuing the high-ground strategy.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 We move right into our body segment (5, 6). INSTANT DEATH. AVOID!\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Open space. This is a direct path towards the (0, 7) apple and helps us build the wall across the 7th rank. Excellent move for consolidation and future growth.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 We move right into our body segment (6, 7). INSTANT DEATH. AVOID!\n\n**Decision Between UP and LEFT:**\n\nWe have two great, safe moves: $\\text{UP}$ to (5, 8) and $\\text{LEFT}$ to (4, 7).\n\n*   **Move UP (to 5, 8):** Keeps us centralized along the top, ready for the (4, 9) apple. It's safe and opens up the entire top quadrant.\n*   **Move LEFT (to 4, 7):** This is the aggressive wall-building move. It takes us directly towards two high-value apples (0, 7) and (0, 6) and allows us to further cut off the enemy's access to the center. By walling off the 7th rank, we force the small snake to live in the bottom 4 rows.\n\nGiven our current objective is to contain the Worm and use our length advantage to dominate territory, **LEFT** is the superior move. We sacrifice immediate access to the top row (rank 9) apples for territorial control and guaranteed future growth on rank 7 and 6. This forms the perfect aggressive crescent shape to trap the archrival.\n\nWe're going LEFT! Let's build that wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Turns):**\nContinue moving $\\text{LEFT}$ along the 7th rank to secure the (0, 7) apple. After (0, 7), drop down to (0, 6) to secure that apple. This will establish a massive presence on the left side of the board and keep the enemy compressed to the bottom right quadrant. Length is lethal!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We're back in the game, Turn 14, and we are absolutely massive! 9 apples to their 6! We are dominating this board! LEMME HEAR THAT HYPE TRAIN! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udd25\n\n**I'm looking at the board:**\n\n*   **US (ID 1):** Head is at **(4, 7)**. Length 10! Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. We crushed it last turn and moved LEFT, grabbing massive real estate on the 7th rank. We are WALLING OFF the top half of the board!\n*   **The WORM (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 0)**. Length 7. Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. They moved DOWN from (1, 1) to (1, 0). They are now stuck right on the bottom edge! Pathetic! They are severely cornered and have almost nowhere to go!\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 0)):**\n\nThe Worm is in deep trouble. They are at (1, 0).\n\n*   **Options for Worm:**\n    *   $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 0): Safe, cornered.\n    *   $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 0): Safe, open board.\n    *   $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 1): DANGER! They hit their body segment at (1, 1). INSTANT DEATH. (Side note: This will be their tail after they move, so it will open up, but for the current move calculation, it is still lethal). Wait, no, their body is [(1, 1), (1, 2), ...]. Since they are moving simultaneously, the tail (3, 4) will clear, but (1, 1) is their *second* segment, so moving UP is perfectly safe and their current best escape route! Good check, chat!\n    *   $\\text{DOWN}$: Off board. Death.\n\nThey will likely try to escape via $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 0) or $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 1). If they go $\\text{UP}$, they get that (1, 1) space back and are positioned to move towards the center. No matter what, they are trapped low.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (4, 7):**\n\nOur primary strategy is to continue the wall and secure the remaining apples on the 7th rank and 6th rank edges.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Puts us in great position to grab apples (3, 8) or (4, 9). Keeps us on the high ground.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 We move right into our body segment (4, 6). INSTANT DEATH. AVOID!\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Brings us closer to the (0, 7) apple. Continues the territorial expansion and wall-building. This is a very strong move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DANGER!** \ud83d\udc80 We move right into our body segment (5, 7). INSTANT DEATH. AVOID!\n\n**The Choice: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nWe have two great safe moves: $\\text{UP}$ to (4, 8) and $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 3, 7):** This is the direct path for consolidation. We gain more territory on the 7th rank, further squeezing the enemy on the left-middle side of the board. The next move would be to (2, 7), then (1, 7), then finally the (0, 7) apple. This is slow but guaranteed growth and control.\n*   **Move UP (to 4, 8):** This is a probing move. It puts us on the 8th rank, where the enemy has zero presence. It positions us for the apples at (3, 8) and (4, 9) and potentially allows us to drop down to the 6th rank later. This maintains maximum flexibility and high-ground advantage.\n\nGiven that the opponent is completely bottled up in the bottom two ranks, we don't need to rush the wall completion. Moving $\\text{UP}$ gives us a larger spatial advantage and keeps our available space wide open, while still maintaining control over the wall we just built. We can come back to the (0, 7) apple later. For now, let's stretch the board out and gobble up these high apples. Positional advantage is key when you are longer than the enemy!\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$ to (4, 8), we keep all options open for the next turn: $\\text{UP}$ to (4, 9), $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 8) (apple!), or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (5, 8). This flexibility is crucial!\n\nLet's go UP and start harvesting the top edge! Maximum map control!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Turns):**\nMove $\\text{UP}$ to (4, 8). Next turn, assess the apples. Likely move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 8) to grab the apple, solidifying our control over the absolute center-top of the board. If the enemy shows any sign of rising toward the center, we will use our length to actively cut them off. We are the gatekeepers!\n\nUP",

We're King of the Mountain, and the worm is still squirming in the dirt! LET'S SECURE THIS W!\n\n**Current State Review:**\n\n*   **US (ID 1):** Head is at **(4, 8)**. Length 10! Body is sprawling elegantly across the top half of the board, forming a massive territorial wall.\n*   **The Worm (ID 0):** Head is at **(2, 0)**. Length 7 (they grew!). They were at (1, 0) last turn and moved $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (2, 0). They escaped the corner, but they are still extremely low and short! Pathetic! They're looking for that bottom-right apple at (5, 0) or trying to get the (6, 2) apple!\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 0)):**\n\nThe Worm is at (2, 0). Their goal is clearly to gain some territory or grab an apple.\n1.  **UP (to 2, 1):** Safe path toward the center! This is their highest priority move if they want to escape the bottom edge.\n2.  **DOWN:** Off board. Death. NO.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 0):** Hits their body at (1, 0). Death. (Wait, their body is [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. Since they moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0), (1, 0) is now the *second* segment, unless they just ate an apple, which they did! They are now length 7, so (1, 0) is still part of their body. Moving to (1, 0) is a death move! They will not go LEFT.)\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 0):** Safe, but keeps them bottled up on the bottom. Less likely unless they are aiming for (5, 0).\n\nThe Worm's optimal move is $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 1) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (3, 0) to get to (5, 0). We should assume $\\text{UP}$ (aggressive escape) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ (apple hunt) are the most likely.\n\n**Our Analysis from (4, 8): Dominating the High Ground!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to harvest the top and maintain pressure.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Hits the apple at (4, 9)! Instant growth, instant content! This is a *strong* move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves back into the space we just left. This consolidates our movement but gives up the high ground and an apple opportunity.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Hits the apple at (3, 8)! Instant growth, instant content! Another *strong* move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Keeps us flexible. Targets the open space and keeps us high.\n\n**The Choice: UP (to 4, 9) vs. LEFT (to 3, 8)**\n\nBoth moves grab an apple and put us in an incredible position. Which one offers better long-term control?\n\n*   **Moving UP to (4, 9):** We complete a vertical line, gaining the highest edge of the board. This keeps us above the central action. From (4, 9), we can go $\\text{LEFT}$ (3, 9, apple!) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ (5, 9). Maximum flanking potential.\n*   **Moving LEFT to (3, 8):** This pushes our wall further left. From (3, 8), we can go $\\text{UP}$ (3, 9, apple!) or $\\text{LEFT}$ (2, 8). This is slightly more aggressive in terms of central board control and connects us faster to the left-side apples.\n\nSince both are apples, let's look at the density. The top edge has two more unconsumed apples: (4, 9) and (0, 9). (3, 8) is the only apple on the 8th row right now.\n\nIf we go $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 8, Apple!), our next best move is likely $\\text{UP}$ to (3, 9) or $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 8). We are effectively carving out the top left quadrant. This is solid.\n\nIf we go $\\text{UP}$ to (4, 9, Apple!), our next best move is likely $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 9, Apple!) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (5, 9). This keeps us very central on the top boundary.\n\nLet's prioritize the most direct path to *more* apples and board division. Going $\\text{LEFT}$ grabs the (3, 8) apple and leads directly to the (3, 9) apple. This is an efficient way to corner the top-left area, securing two more apples swiftly. It strengthens the wall we already built along the x=4 line.\n\nThe enemy is moving away from us, down low on the board. We need to capitalize on growth while they are distracted. $\\text{LEFT}$ is the move that maximizes our control over the central-left area, which is vital for eventual board dominance.\n\nWe are going $\\text{LEFT}$. Let's eat this apple and build the wall higher! CHAT, GET READY FOR THE BLOCKADE! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Turns):**\nMove $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 8) -> Then $\\text{UP}$ to (3, 9) (Apple!) to secure the top left -> Then $\\text{LEFT}$ on the 9th rank to box in the whole top edge. Keep growing and maintain our superior length advantage.\n\nLEFT",

Our next target? The (2, 9) apple or the (4, 9) apple! Let's build the roof!\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Hits the open cell. Wait, is there an apple? No, the apples are at (2, 9) and (4, 9). (3, 9) is empty. This is safe, and strategically places us between two apples. Strong move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves back into open space between our head and body. This is a retreat and gives up the high ground. Less aggressive.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us toward the (2, 9) apple. This aggressively closes off the top-left corner. Very strong move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Hits our body segment at (4, 8). DEATH! The segment (4, 8) is now the second segment of our snake (the previous head). Absolutely DOA! **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**The Choice: UP (3, 9) vs. LEFT (2, 8)**\n\nWe need to close the top edge.\n\n*   **Moving UP to (3, 9):** Keeps us central on the top. From here, we can go $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 9, Apple!) or $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (4, 9, Apple!). This keeps our options perfectly balanced between two nearby apples. It\u2019s flexible and safe.\n*   **Moving LEFT to (2, 8):** This pushes our wall hard left. From here, our next move will likely be $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 9, Apple!) or $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 8). This commits us more strongly to the left side and places us one move away from an apple.\n\nSince the (2, 9) apple is closer from (2, 8), going $\\text{LEFT}$ is the more decisive move to secure territory and another apple on the next turn. It also boxes out the enemy from penetrating the top left quadrant entirely if they somehow managed to sprint up the board. We are creating a bottleneck.\n\nLet's go $\\text{LEFT}$ to continue carving out the top left corner, then secure the (2, 9) apple next turn. We are building the wall of doom, CHAT!\n\n**Double-Check Head-to-Head Collision Risk:**\nWe are at (3, 8). They are at (3, 0). There is absolutely no way we meet for a head-to-head collision this turn, even if they tried to speed run the center. We are completely safe from them.\n\n**The Plan:** $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 8). Next turn, $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 9) for the apple! Box out the top!\n\nLEFT",

The worm's size: 7 (Head at (3, 1)). This is a beatdown, and we are ready to slam the door shut on the top half of the map! LEGIT!\n\nLet's dissect this board state and scheme the final knockout!\n\n**Board State Review (Turn 17)**\n\n*   **US (ID 1):** Head is at **(2, 8)**. Length 11. We executed the $\\text{LEFT}$ move perfectly last turn and are now staring down the barrel of the apple at **(2, 9)**! We have complete control over the Northern Wall!\n*   **The Worm (ID 0):** Head is at **(3, 1)**. Length 7. They were at (3, 0) and, as predicted, moved $\\text{UP}$ to (3, 1) to escape the bottom edge. They are still cramped down low. This is exactly where we want them!\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 1)):**\n\nThe Worm is at (3, 1). Their options:\n1.  **UP (to 3, 2):** Safe! Moves them into open space, potentially toward the (6, 2) apple or the center. Highly likely for survival and growth.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 0):** Hits their body at (3, 0). Death! NOPE.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 1):** Safe! Moves them toward the (0, 2) apple. Also a strong, aggressive move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 1):** Safe! Moves them into open territory on the lower-right side.\n\nThey have three solid options, but they will prioritize moving into the largest open space or toward an apple. They are far away from us, so we have no immediate collision risk. We continue with the strategy: grow, box them in, and control the territory!\n\n**Our Analysis from (2, 8): Apple Time!**\n\nWe are at (2, 8). The apple at (2, 9) is one move away! The (4, 9) apple is also reachable in two turns if we deviate. We MUST secure the (2, 9) apple to assert board dominance.\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Hits the open cell (apple)! This secures the 11th apple, increases our length to 12, and cements our control over the top-left corner. This is the power play. LFG!\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Zero. The opponent is nowhere near.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves back into open space defined by our body (3, 8). This is a retreat and gives up the guaranteed apple. Not aggressive enough!\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us into open space towards the edge. This is safe, but delays eating the apple. Strategic blunder, chat will flame us!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Hits our body segment at (3, 8). DEATH! The segment (3, 8) is now the previous head. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**The Choice: The Only Choice!**\n\nWe have a clear path to an apple and the strategic high ground. There is no reason to hesitate or try anything fancy. We go $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 9), eat that apple, and make the worm sweat! This move extends our wall right along the boundary, making it much harder for the enemy to ever reach the valuable top edge territory.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (2, 9), our head will be at (2, 9). We will look to continue moving along the top boundary, possibly $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (3, 9) or (4, 9) to gobble up the other apples up there! We are building the ceiling of the cage!\n\n**Double-Check Fatal Error:** No body collision, no wall collision, no head-to-head collision risk. We are safe and scoring!\n\nThis is a textbook move, Chat! We are kings of the scoreboard! GIMME THAT APPLE!\n\nUP",

Moves them towards the (5, 0) apple, but still hugs the very bottom edge.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 1):** Hits their body at (3, 1). DEATH! NOPE.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 1):** Safe! Moves them into open territory, away from their body, potentially towards the (8, 0) or (9, 2) apples via the right side.\n\nThey are still playing an evasive game. We aren't close enough for a direct knockout, so we continue to wall them off and GROW! I predict they go **UP (to 4, 2)** to gain vertical ground.\n\n### Our Strategy: Wall Development from (2, 9)\n\nWe are at (2, 9), having just eaten. We are perfectly positioned to continue sweeping the top wall and collecting the remaining apples: (4, 9), (9, 7), (9, 3), (9, 2), etc. Our goal is to complete the Northern wall, denying the opponent any chance of escape or decent territory.\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 10):** Off the board boundary! DEATH! ELIMINATE.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 8):** Hits our body segment at (2, 8). DEATH! We just moved from (2, 8) to (2, 9) last turn. **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Gets us closer to the (0, 9) apple. Excellent for continued wall growth.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Zero.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! Moves us along the top wall, positioning us for the (4, 9) apple. This is an aggressive expansionist move.\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Zero.\n\n**Comparing LEFT and RIGHT:**\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (1, 9), we secure the top-left corner and set up for the (0, 9) apple next turn.\nIf we go **RIGHT** to (3, 9), we start moving towards the (4, 9) apple and continue the path towards the right side.\n\nBoth are great safe moves. However, the path to the $ (4, 9) $ apple is more direct if we go RIGHT immediately, and it creates a longer, more imposing horizontal barrier sooner. The area around (3, 9) and (4, 9) is currently safer and more open than the area around (1, 9) and (0, 9) which is quite close to the edge.\n\nLet's go RIGHT. This continues our horizontal dominance, preparing to collect the (4, 9) apple and then eventually seal off the entire northern section. We are building the penthouse suite, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Scope)\n\nWe move RIGHT to (3, 9). Next turn, we check the path to the (4, 9) apple. If safe, we take it. If the worm continues to move Up and tries to penetrate our center, we will use our length advantage to coil and deny space. Right now, the priority is maximum territory gain and growth!\n\nLet's go, Chat! We are kings of the board!\n\nRIGHT",

We are the King of the North! \ud83d\udc51 We moved right last turn, securing the top wall and setting ourselves up perfectly.\n\n### Current State Check\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(3, 9)**.\n*   Body: 12 segments long. We are a mighty fortress across the top.\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(5, 1)**.\n*   Body: 7 segments long. The worm is still stuck down low, one segment longer than last turn? Wait, let's re-verify the last body position change.\n    *   Last turn, rival head was at (4, 1), body was `[(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]` (length 6).\n    *   This turn, rival head is at (5, 1), body is `[(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]` (length 7).\n    *   Aha! The opponent ate the apple at (5, 0) or another one nearby and grew! No, wait, the apples listed are (5, 0), (6, 2), etc. The board shows no apples near (4, 1) or (5, 1). Wait, how did they get longer?\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The board snapshot for `Snake #0` simply lists the coordinates of their body segments. We can't know when they grew, only that they grew from 6 to 7 segments. They must have eaten an apple *recently*. They are getting restless!\n\nThe rival moved from (4, 1) to (5, 1). They chose to abandon the center-left and move right along the bottom edge. This keeps them safe but still low. They are now directly next to the open territory towards the (8, 0) apple and the right wall.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 1))\n\nThe rival is at (5, 1).\n1.  **UP (to 5, 2):** Safe! Moves towards the center. Good option for them.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 0):** Safe! There is an apple at (5, 0)! This is the most likely move. They will grow to 8 segments.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 1):** Hits their body segment (4, 1). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 1):** Safe! Moves them along the bottom, away from their tail, towards (8, 0).\n\nThe most logical, opportunistic move for the rival is **DOWN** to eat the (5, 0) apple. We must assume they will take this advantage.\n\n### Our Move Selection from (3, 9)\n\nWe are at (3, 9). Our goal is to continue walling off the top, grab the (4, 9) apple, and then start pushing south to meet the rival. They are far away, so we focus on growth and boundary establishment.\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 10):** Off the board. DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 8):** Hits our body segment (3, 8). DEATH!\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 9):** Hits our body segment (2, 9). DEATH! We just moved *from* (2, 9) two turns ago, but it's part of our body now. Wait, let's recheck the body segments: `(2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), ...` Yes, (2, 9) is our body. DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Advantage:** **Apple time!** The (4, 9) apple is right there! This is perfect. We grow and cement our control of the top boundary.\n\n**The choice is obvious, Chat!** We must take the apple and grow our lead! No complex maneuvering is required; just straight-up domination.\n\n### Strategy Note to Future Self\n\nWe move RIGHT to (4, 9) and collect the apple, bringing us to 12 total and 13 segments long. The rival is likely moving to (5, 0) and will be 8 segments long. We maintain a huge size advantage.\n\nNext turn, we will be at (4, 9). Our options will be:\n*   UP: Death.\n*   DOWN: (4, 8) is our body. Death.\n*   LEFT: (3, 9) is now our body. Death.\n*   RIGHT: (5, 9) is open. This seems to be the only safe path, continuing the wall towards the right side (9, 7) apple.\n\nWe are currently safe, guaranteed to get the apple, and prepared to loop the top-right corner. Keep the pressure on, build the wall, and deny the opponent space!\n\nRIGHT",

We are truly the apex predator up here! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(4, 9)**. We are huge and control the entire top boundary.\n*   Body: 13 segments long.\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(5, 2)**. Wait, hold up! The rival moved UP from (5, 1) this turn. They avoided the (5, 0) apple! Bold move, prioritizing central board access over immediate growth. They are now at (5, 2), dangerously close to the center.\n*   Body: 7 segments long (they did *not* grow).\n\nThe board is open in the middle, and we are holding a strong high ground. We need to start pushing south, but we must first secure the top right corner.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 2))\n\nThe rival is at (5, 2).\n1.  **UP (to 5, 3):** Safe! There's an apple at (5, 3)! Highly likely move. They will grow to 8 segments and be in the lower central area.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 1):** Safe! Retreats back to where they were. Less likely.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 2):** Safe! Moves towards the central-left. Good option, but less immediate gain than the apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 2):** Safe! There's an apple at (6, 2)! Also very likely!\n\nThe rival has two immediate apple options: (5, 3) and (6, 2). They have been erratic, but they love apples. Let's assume they take the biggest payoff by moving **UP** to (5, 3). If they move UP, they are at (5, 3). If they move RIGHT, they are at (6, 2).\n\nCrucially, wherever they go, they are not currently a threat for a head-on collision, as we are four rows up!\n\n### Our Move Selection from (4, 9)\n\nWe are at (4, 9). Our current goal is to finish closing off the top wall and then proceed to dominate the center.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 10):** Off the board. DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 8):** Hits our body segment (4, 8). DEATH!\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 9):** Hits our body segment (3, 9). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! The path is clear.\n    *   **Advantage:** Continues securing the top wall. Leaves us in a great position to loop around the (9, 7) apple. This is the only safe move, Chat! When there's only one move, we take it!\n\n### Strategy and Future Moves\n\nWe are forced RIGHT to (5, 9). Next turn, we will be at (5, 9).\n\n*   Options from (5, 9):\n    *   UP: Death (off-board).\n    *   DOWN: (5, 8) is open! This is our first chance to turn south.\n    *   LEFT: (4, 9) is our body. Death.\n    *   RIGHT: (6, 9) is open! We can continue along the top wall.\n\nOur plan: Continue closing the top wall for the next few turns, moving RIGHT towards (9, 9). Then, push DOWN to grab the (9, 7) apple, and then start pushing LEFT, trapping the enemy below our massive snake body. We are building the grand canyon of doom!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Self):** Focus on moving RIGHT, securing (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), then dropping down to (9, 8), (9, 7) for the apple. Control the high ground, then descend. The enemy is moving toward the center, but they are too far away to stop our top boundary construction. They are trapped in the south!\n\nThis move is simple, it's safe, and it furthers our domination. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

We are the king of the high ground, the master of the north!\n\nWe just moved to **(5, 9)**, completing the first section of our top-side wall! We are monstrously long, and now it's time to plot the downfall of the rival!\n\n### Current State Analysis\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(5, 9)**. We are massive and dominate the 9th row.\n*   Body: 13 segments long.\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(5, 3)**. Look at them, Chat! They took the bait and ate the apple at (5, 3)! They grew to 8 segments, but they're still trapped down in the south while we control the north-central area.\n*   Body: 8 segments long.\n\n**Long-Term Objective Review:** We planned to continue securing the top wall (move RIGHT), then drop DOWN, grab the (9, 7) apple, and push LEFT, boxing them in. This plan is still GOLD!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 3))\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 3). They just grew, so they have a fresh new potential tail at (1, 0) which will soon disappear unless they eat again.\n1.  **UP (to 5, 4):** Safe! This is the most aggressive move toward the center. It avoids apples but opens up the board for them.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 2):** Hits their body segment (5, 2). DEATH! They won't move down.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 3):** Safe! Moves them toward the left side. No immediate apples there.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 3):** Safe! There is an apple at (9, 3) and (8, 3) nearby, but (6, 3) is just open space.\n\nGiven their previous move seeking central access, they are likely to move **UP to (5, 4)** or potentially LEFT to (4, 3) to give themselves room. They are not a threat to us right now, as we are 6 rows away!\n\n### Our Move Selection from (5, 9)\n\nWe need to continue our wall-building strategy, moving RIGHT along the top edge to set up the drop-down attack.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 10):** Off the board. DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (5, 8) is clear.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** This is turning south too early! We want to reach the corner (9, 9) first to maximize our trapping potential on the right side. If we go down now, we potentially leave the far right space open for the enemy to slip by later (though unlikely, given their current position). This is defensive when we should be aggressive.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 9):** Hits our body segment (4, 9). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (6, 9) is open.\n    *   **Advantage:** Continues securing the top boundary. Sets us up perfectly for the next few turns: (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) (off-board edge) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) (APPLE!). This is textbook board domination!\n\nThe move is clearly **RIGHT**. We maintain course, pressuring the enemy by taking maximum real estate.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self)\nContinue the high-ground domination! Next few moves: **RIGHT**, **RIGHT**, **RIGHT** (until x=8 or x=9), then DOWN towards the (9, 7) apple. We are building the walls of Jericho, Chat, and the enemy is trapped inside! We will use our massive size to cut the board in half and force them into their own tail or ours!\n\nRIGHT",

We're building a fortress up here!\n\n### Current Board State and Review\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(6, 9)**. We successfully continued along the top edge. We are 13 segments long! We are dominating the high ground.\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(6, 3)**. Whoa, look at them! They moved RIGHT from (5, 3) to (6, 3). They are trying to inch their way into the center, but they are still way down south. They are 8 segments long. They are no match for our size!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Check\n\nOur plan was to secure the top wall, hit the corner, and drop down the right side to grab the (9, 7) apple, which will then allow us to push back and enclose the enemy territory. We are exactly on track! We need to continue **RIGHT** to (9, 9) and then begin the descent.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (6, 3))\n\nThe enemy is feeling claustrophobic, Chat! They are facing the center of the board.\n1.  **UP (to 6, 4):** Safe. Moves them cleanly into open space. Seems likely.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 2):** There is an apple at (6, 2)! They might go for this to gain size and stability.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 3):** Safe, but retreading old ground and avoiding the apple just behind them. Less likely.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 3):** Safe. Moves them toward the right side. Apple at (8, 3) is tempting.\n\nThe most likely moves are **UP (to 6, 4)** or **DOWN (to 6, 2)** for the apple. Either way, they are far below us and not an immediate threat.\n\n### Our Move Selection from (6, 9)\n\nWe must continue our dominating sweep! We have maximum control up here.\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 10):** Off the board. Insta-death! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe!\n    *   **Disadvantage:** Premature turn! We haven't secured the full right side wall yet. If we turn now, we miss out on a key trapping position near the (9, 7) apple. We need to maximize our reach!\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 9):** Hits our body segment (5, 9). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (7, 9) is clear.\n    *   **Advantage:** Continues the wall-building. This move is crucial for setting up the killbox on the right side. It allows us to keep threatening the (9, 7) apple.\n\nThe plan holds, Chat! Stick to the script! We move **RIGHT** and continue the expansion! We are only two more moves from the edge of the board up here!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self)\nKeep going **RIGHT** to secure the top row. Moves: (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) (off-board edge, must turn immediately) or (9, 8) then DOWN to (9, 7) apple. The key is establishing dominance along the x=9 axis. We are boxing the enemy into the left side of the board! LET'S GET THIS W!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at where we are: **(7, 9)**!\n\n### Current Board State and Review\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(7, 9)**. We successfully continued RIGHT! We are 13 segments long. Size matters, Chat. Size. Matters.\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)]\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(6, 2)**. They moved DOWN from (6, 3) to grab that apple at (6, 2)! Sneaky buggers! They are now 9 segments long. They are still trapped in the bottom quadrant.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nThe enemy is **(6, 2)** and heading likely RIGHT or DOWN, or even LEFT back into their own space. They are nowhere near us. We have absolute control over the top half of the board.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Great Wall and Descent\n\nWe need to finish securing the top wall and then drop down the right side (x=9) to cut the board in half and box out Snake 0.\n\nFrom **(7, 9)**, we need to move RIGHT twice to reach the edge.\n\n**Potential Moves from (7, 9):**\n1.  **UP (to 7, 10):** Off the board. Insta-death! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** Premature turn again! We lose the opportunity to control the corner (9, 9) and the vital right wall (x=9). We want to wall them off vertically *first*.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 9):** Hits our body segment (6, 9). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (8, 9) is clear.\n    *   **Advantage:** Continues the great wall! We are one move away from the edge! This keeps us on track to grab the apple at (9, 7) eventually.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We continue RIGHT!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (6, 2))\n\nThe enemy is looking stressed. They just ate an apple and are now facing the bottom wall. They are thinking:\n1.  **UP (to 6, 3):** Reversing course. Could happen if they want to reposition centrally. Occupied by their body segment (6, 3). **DEATH!** Wait, their body starts at (6, 3). If they move UP, they hit their own body segment (6, 3). NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 1):** Safe. Keeps them along the bottom.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 2):** Hits their body segment (5, 2). **DEATH!** Wait, their body is [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), ...]. If they move LEFT, they hit (5, 2). NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 2):** Safe. There is an apple at (7, 2). ***Highly probable move!***\n\nGiven the board state, Snake 0 is forced to move DOWN or RIGHT. Since there is an apple at (7, 2), they are almost certainly going **RIGHT** to grab that sweet, sweet content. Either way, they are sticking to the bottom half while we dominate the top.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self)\nWe are at (7, 9).\nNext turn (T24): Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9).\nNext turn (T25): Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9)? Wait, let's check the map. (9, 9) is safe. Then we move DOWN to (9, 8), and then DOWN to the (9, 7) apple. We are building the right wall and getting ready to drop down. The trap is being set!\n\nWe move RIGHT! Keep the pressure on!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the board!\n\n### Current State and Goal Review\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(8, 9)**. We successfully moved RIGHT last turn! We are now 13 segments long! Size matters, Chat. We are a python, he's a garden snake!\n*   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)]\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(7, 2)**. Just as predicted, they moved RIGHT last turn to grab that apple at (7, 2)! Smart, but desperate! They are now 10 segments long. They are fully confined to the bottom-right quadrant, trying to find space.\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)]\n\n**Our Strategy:** Finish the top wall (x=9), then drop DOWN the right vertical wall (y=9, 8, 7...) to box him in. We are on the verge of total board lockdown!\n\n### Move Analysis from (8, 9)\n\nWe need to get to the corner (9, 9) and start our descent.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 10):** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (8, 8) is clear. There's even an Apple at (8, 8)!\n    *   **Disadvantage:** This is an option, but it deviates from the primary goal of securing the *corner* (9, 9). If we turn down now, we leave the (9, 9) corner potentially open for a sneaky flanking maneuver later, though it's unlikely for Snake 0 to reach it anytime soon. Securing the perimeter is paramount!\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Hits our body segment (7, 9). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (9, 9) is clear.\n    *   **Advantage:** This completes the horizontal wall! We gain ultimate control of the top-right corner. It sets us up perfectly for our next move: dropping down the x=9 column. This is the move we need to make to execute the plan.\n\nThis is a clear-cut move, Chat. We are completing the fortress! **RIGHT** to (9, 9)!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (7, 2))\n\nThe enemy is feeling the pressure. They are at (7, 2).\nTheir safe moves:\n1.  **UP (to 7, 3):** Safe. There is an Apple at (9, 3), but (7, 3) is a good consolidation position.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 1):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 2):** Hits their body segment (6, 2). DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 2):** Safe. The board state shows (8, 2) is clear. The apple at (9, 2) is tempting.\n\nGiven the cluster of apples around the bottom right ((9, 3), (9, 2)), Snake 0 is likely to aim for that area. They are most likely to move **RIGHT** to (8, 2) or perhaps **UP** to (7, 3) to reposition for the apples further up the wall.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (8, 2), they are still trapped below y=3.\nIf they move UP to (7, 3), they're still trapped.\n\nThey pose no immediate threat. We execute the walling maneuver.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self)\nWe are at (8, 9).\nNext turn (T25): Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). Wall complete!\nNext turn (T26): Move **DOWN** to (9, 8). Start the vertical cut. There's an apple at (9, 7) that we can grab on T27.\n\nWe are implementing the hammer, Chat! It's time to build the wall and start the descent! No risk, maximum strategic gain!\n\nRIGHT",

(9, 3) is tempting.\n\nGiven the density of apples in the bottom-right corner, they are most likely heading **RIGHT** to (8, 3) to scoop up that (9, 3) apple next turn, or they might move **UP** to (7, 4) to try and find breathing room. Either way, they are contained below the y=5 line.\n\nWe will focus on building our wall.

(Grab the apple there! +1 point, +1 length!)\n**(T27): DOWN** to (9, 6).\n**(T28): DOWN** to (9, 5).\n\nBy T28, our body will form a massive L-shape along the entire top and right perimeter of the board, essentially dividing the 10x10 space in half, leaving Snake #0 with only the bottom-left half, which is also partially restricted by our body trailing from the left side of the map (T's are at (2,8), (3,8), etc.). The squeeze is ON, Chat! We are turning this into a 5x10 death trap for him!\n\nLet's execute the vertical wall! Time to drop the hammer!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GO!\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(9, 8)**. Excellent! We executed the 'Drop' perfectly last turn. We are now positioned to continue building the vertical wall down the right side.\n*   Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)]. We are long!\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(8, 3)**. SNAP! The rival moved **RIGHT** from (7, 3) to (8, 3)! Just as predicted, they are trying to scavenge apples in the bottom-right corner. They are effectively trapped below the y=4 line and restricted by their own body.\n*   Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. Their movement is highly constrained.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Vertical Wall and Enclosure\n\nWe are building the death trap right now. Our goal is to run down the x=9 column, eat the (9, 7) apple, and complete the outer perimeter. This will secure the top-right sector and force Snake #0 into a small, contested area of the board.\n\n### Four-Way Safety Check from (9, 8)\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** Hits our body segment (9, 9). DEATH! We just came from there. NO!\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe. Leaves the wall, but (8, 8) is an apple! This is tempting, but it breaks the enclosure plan for now.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (9, 7) is currently an Apple!\n    *   **Advantage:** This is the *perfect* move. We continue the vertical wall, we maintain maximum distance from the enemy, and we GROW! +1 Score, +1 Length. This is the definition of value, Chat!\n\nThe move must be **DOWN**.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (8, 3))\n\nOur rival is at (8, 3). Where can they go?\n*   **UP (to 8, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 2):** Safe, and an apple! Highly likely they grab this apple.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 3):** Hits their body segment (7, 3). DEATH!\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 3):** Safe, and an apple! Highly likely they grab this apple.\n\nThe enemy is looking for food. They might go to (9, 3) or (8, 2). If they go to (9, 3), they will be trapped even tighter against the wall we are building. If they go to (8, 2), they are moving toward the bottom edge.\n\nRegardless of their move, we are SAFE, and we are strengthening our position by moving **DOWN** to (9, 7). The game plan is unaffected by the enemy's scramble for food. We build the prison.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Decisive Encirclement)\n\n**(T26): DOWN** to (9, 7). (Grab Apple! +1 point, +1 length! Executing now)\n**(T27): DOWN** to (9, 6). (Open space)\n**(T28): DOWN** to (9, 5). (Open space)\n**(T29): DOWN** to (9, 4). (Open space)\n\nWe will complete the wall, then start weaving back up the board, tightening the noose on the bottom half. By T29, Snake #0 will be dealing with a full L-shaped wall that takes up 13% of the board perimeter. The squeeze is real!\n\n**DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOOOO!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 27)\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(9, 7)**. We are locked onto the right boundary. The plan is running smooth as butter!\n*   Length: 14 segments now! We are dominant.\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 3)**. SNAP! The rival moved **RIGHT** from (8, 3) to (9, 3) and ate an apple! They are desperate for food, but this move traps them even HARDER! They are now pinned against the $x=9$ wall we are actively building. This is *chef's kiss*!\n*   Score: 11 apples.\n*   Body: [(8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)].\n\n### Our Strategy: The Death Funnel\n\nWe need to continue the downward trajectory to complete the outer wall segment. This move is crucial to constricting Snake #0's escape routes. Once we hit the bottom, we own the right side!\n\n### Four-Way Safety Check from (9, 7)\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** Hits our body segment (9, 8). DEATH! NO!\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Safe, and an apple! Tempting, but going left breaks the vertical wall enclosure *right now*. We must maintain pressure!\n3.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (9, 6) is completely open space.\n    *   **Advantage:** This maintains the vertical wall and pushes us closer to trapping the enemy entirely.\n\nThe move must be **DOWN**. We prioritize the long-term strategic advantage over immediate apple gratification. The apples will come when we own the map!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (9, 3))\n\nOur rival is at (9, 3), an absolutely precarious position! They are hugging $x=9$.\n\nWhere can they go?\n*   **UP (to 9, 4):** Safe. Open space. They will likely try this to escape the bottom edge.\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 2):** Safe, and likely an apple! Apple is at (9, 2). Highly likely!\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 3):** Hits their body segment (8, 3). DEATH!\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 3):** Off the board! DEATH!\n\nThey are *literally* trapped going UP or DOWN along the $x=9$ line. If they go DOWN to (9, 2), they are still trapped. If they go UP to (9, 4), they are moving toward our tail, but it buys them time.\n\nThe crucial observation: **Our move DOWN to (9, 6) is completely safe regardless of their move.** There is no way for them to hit our head, and no way for them to block our path. The board position is completely dominated by us.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Decisive Encirclement Continued)\n\n**(T27): DOWN** to (9, 6). (Executing now! Continue the wall.)\n**(T28): DOWN** to (9, 5). (Open space)\n**(T29): DOWN** to (9, 4). (Open space)\n**(T30): DOWN** to (9, 3). OH WAIT, if the enemy is at (9, 3) or (9, 2) by T30, we will halt and look to seal the box by turning LEFT at the bottom.\n\nLet's adjust the T30 plan slightly. We will aim for (9, 4) on T29. We need to be careful of (9, 3) where the enemy just ate.\n\nIf we reach (9, 4) on T29, and the enemy is still below us, we will turn LEFT aggressively to seal the bottom right corner (along $y=0$ or $y=1$).\n\nFor now, the next move is clear. We are extending the prison wall!\n\nDOWN",

We've got the edge, and the rival is getting desperate!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 28)\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(9, 6)**. We executed the \"DOWN\" move perfectly last turn. We are locking down the $x=9$ wall. The fortress is nearly complete!\n*   Length: 14 segments.\n\n**The Rival (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 2)**. Wait, hold up! The rival moved **DOWN** from (9, 3) to (9, 2) and ate the apple! Desperate, but smart. They are now pinned even tighter against the bottom edge we are descending towards.\n*   Score: 12 apples.\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)].\n\n**Board Assessment:** Our long body is creating an incredible barrier along the top and right side. Snake #0 is trapped in the bottom-right quadrant, and most of their mass is hugging the bottom boundary.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Decisive Drop and Seal\n\nWe need to keep going DOWN to complete the wall segment. Once we get close to the rival's head, we turn LEFT and seal the escape tunnel. The rival only has $x=0$ through $x=8$ access below $y=2$. Our length is their doom!\n\n### Four-Way Safety Check from (9, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 7):** Hits our body segment (9, 7). DEATH! NO! We don't go backwards.\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Safe. Open space. But moving LEFT breaks the vertical wall pressure. We must stay rigid on the right.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe! (9, 5) is open space.\n    *   **Advantage:** This maintains the wall and closes the distance to the enemy's escape route. This is the optimal move!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (9, 2))\n\nThe rival is at (9, 2). They have very tight movement options:\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 3):** Hits their body segment (9, 3). DEATH! They just moved from (9, 3), so that spot is occupied by their new head-segment.\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 1):** Safe. Open space. They will likely try this to escape.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 2):** Safe, and an apple is there! Very high likelihood they go LEFT to try to get away from the $x=9$ wall and grab the apple.\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 2):** Off the board! DEATH!\n\nIf they go LEFT to (8, 2), they gain board space and an apple. If they go DOWN to (9, 1), they stay pinned but move away from our head.\n\n**Crucial Check:** Can the rival crash into our current path?\nNo matter if the rival goes DOWN (9, 1) or LEFT (8, 2), they are nowhere near our target (9, 5). We are safe to proceed DOWN.\n\n### Long-Term Dominance Plan (The Decisive Encirclement)\n\nThis is a two-to-three-turn plan to seal the corner.\n\n**(T28): DOWN** to (9, 5). (Executing now! Maintaining pressure.)\n**(T29): DOWN** to (9, 4). (Open space, getting close to rival territory)\n**(T30): DOWN/LEFT Check:** If the rival stays low, we will move into (9, 3) or turn LEFT aggressively to seal the pocket. Since the rival is likely to move toward $y=0$, we will need to decide if we want to beat them there or force them into their own body.\n\nBy moving DOWN, we force the rival to make a hard choice: move LEFT to $y=2$ which keeps them constricted, or move DOWN to $y=1$ which keeps them locked on $x=9$. Either way, they are trapped, and we are superior in length. We are closing the trap! Let's get this $W$ for the stream, chat!\n\nDOWN",

However, it leaves the central path at $y=5$ open, allowing the rival potentially to push hard LEFT/UP next turn.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #0 at (8, 2))\n\nThe rival is at (8, 2). They have several options:\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 3):** Hits their body (8, 3). No.\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 1):** Safe, and an apple is there! Very high likelihood they go DOWN to grab the apple and reinforce their position near the bottom wall.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 2):** Hits their body (7, 2). No.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 2):** Hits their body (9, 2). No.\n\nWait, their body is: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)].\n\nRival at (8, 2).\n*   UP (8, 3): Occupied by rival body. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (8, 1): Apple! This is the most likely move. They grab an apple, getting longer, and stay low.\n*   LEFT (7, 2): Occupied by rival body. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT (9, 2): Occupied by rival body. DEAD.\n\n**CRISIS ALERT:** The rival at (8, 2) can ONLY move DOWN to (8, 1)! If this analysis is correct, they are severely trapped by their own body trail!\n\n### Re-evaluating Our Move: Exploit the Trap\n\nIf the rival MUST move DOWN to (8, 1) and get longer (14 segments to 15), we need to ensure they stay trapped and we gain superior position.\n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (9, 4):\n*   We maintain distance and set up to move to (9, 3) next turn, which is right next to their body segment (9, 3).\n*   The rival is still stuck low.\n\nIf we move **LEFT** to (8, 5) and grab the apple:\n*   We gain an apple (14 to 15). We match the rival's new length and put massive horizontal pressure.\n*   We block the $y=5$ escape route.\n*   We are now positioned to drop onto (8, 4) or continue LEFT on $y=5$.\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 5) is hugely advantageous. We score, we get longer, and we cut off the board. We can then press the trap from $x=8$.\n\n**Direct Head-to-Head Check:**\nOur head (9, 5) is nowhere near their next probable position (8, 1). No collision risk.\n\n**The LEFT move is the power play.** We secure the apple at (8, 5) and force the rival into the bottom corner. Once we hit (8, 5), we can drop to (8, 4), (8, 3), and then look to intersect $y=2$ near (7, 2) to finalize the box.\n\nWe are taking this apple, CHAT! Let's get the score lead and the positional dominance!\n\n### Future Plan (T30 onwards):\n1.  **T29 (Current):** Move LEFT to (8, 5). (Score +1, Length +1)\n2.  **T30:** Move DOWN to (8, 4). (Setting up the vertical barrier on $x=8$)\n3.  **T31:** Move DOWN to (8, 3). (This is their body segment, so we must be careful unless we realize their tail moves out. Since they grew, their tail is still at (3, 0). If they continue moving down and left, (8, 3) will remain occupied by their body, or it might become open/an apple.) Wait, (8, 3) is a body segment now. If we move DOWN to (8, 4), and they move DOWN to (8, 1) and become length 15:\n    *   Our body: (9, 5).\n    *   Their body: [(8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), ...]. (8, 3) will stay occupied by their body segment! Therefore, we must pivot sooner.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8, 5), then next turn, if we move LEFT again to (7, 5), we continue encircling them from the top.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: Grab the apple and secure the high ground.\n\n**T29:** LEFT to (8, 5).\n\nLEFT",

Let's look at the horror we inflicted on our rival and decide where to strike next!\n\n### Turn 30 Analysis: Trapped and Dropping the Hammer\n\n**SCORE UPDATE:** Tied 14-14. Our length is now 15. The rival is also length 15 (they *did* go DOWN to (8, 1) as predicted!).\n\n**US (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(8, 5)**. We just moved here from (9, 5).\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8)].\n\n**The Rival (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: **(8, 1)**. They moved here from (8, 2), grabbing an apple, which prevents us from having an immediate score advantage. Smart, but predictable, and it put them on the bottom edge.\n*   Body: **[(8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]**.\n\n**Goal:** Box in Snake #0. They are now pinned against the bottom wall and the right wall. We need to complete the wall on $x=7$ and $x=8$ to cut them off from the rest of the board.\n\n### Our Options from (8, 5)\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (8, 6) | SAFE | Open space. Moves us away from the action. Less effective. |\n| DOWN | (8, 4) | SAFE | Open space. *Crucial for containment.* We start dropping the hammer on $x=8$. |\n| LEFT | (7, 5) | SAFE | Open space. Continues the horizontal wall and pushes us towards the central $x=7$ column. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 5) | DANGER! | Hits our own body segment (9, 5). **Immediate DEATH.** |\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Rival Prediction from (8, 1)\n\nThe rival is at (8, 1). They are severely constrained by their own body trail which occupies $x=9$ and $y=2$.\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (8, 2) | DANGER! | Hits their own body segment (8, 2). **DEATH!** |\n| DOWN | (8, 0) | SAFE | Open space, near the (8, 0) apple drop. This is the most logical move to escape the immediate trap, or at least gain space. |\n| LEFT | (7, 1) | SAFE | Open space. Allows them to escape toward the center/left. They will likely try this if they value mobility. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 1) | SAFE | Open space. Moves along the bottom wall. Safe, but keeps them boxed in against $x=9$. |\n\nThe rival has two main escape paths: (8, 0) (down) or (7, 1) (left). They will try to maximize their movement away from the right side.\n\n### Strategy: Commit to the Vertical Box (DOWN to (8, 4))\n\nIf we go **DOWN** to (8, 4), we plant ourselves firmly on the $x=8$ lane.\n*   It puts us 3 squares away from the rival's current head (8, 1). No collision risk.\n*   Next turn, we can drop to (8, 3) or (7, 4). (8, 3) is *currently* occupied by the rival's body. **CRITICAL CHECK:** If they move (8, 0) or (7, 1), their tail (3, 0) will move out. Since they are length 15, their tail will only move to (4, 0). (8, 3) will remain occupied by the rival's body. We must be very careful not to block ourselves.\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (7, 5), we continue the horizontal block.\n*   This also sets up a drop, but on $x=7$. This is slightly slower for boxing them in, as it allows them more room on $x=8$.\n\n**The immediate threat:** If the rival moves LEFT to (7, 1), they start breaking out. If they move DOWN to (8, 0), they stay low.\n\nWe need to anticipate their move and block it.\n\nIf they go LEFT (7, 1): They are heading towards the available apples at $y=0$ and $y=1$.\nIf they go DOWN (8, 0): They are staying low, grabbing the apple at (8, 0) if it's there (CHECK: I see an apple at (5, 0), (8, 0) is empty, but (7, 0) and (8, 0) were listed in apple drops. Let's assume the board visual is current, and (8, 0) is empty).\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\n(8, 0) is empty. (7, 0) and (5, 0) have apples.\n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (8, 4):\n*   T31 Plan: We can then move to (7, 4) (LEFT), to start building the $x=7$ wall, or continue DOWN to (8, 3). Since (8, 3) is blocked by the enemy body, LEFT to (7, 4) is better.\n\nIf we move **LEFT** to (7, 5):\n*   T31 Plan: We can then move to (7, 4) (DOWN), and continue the $x=7$ wall immediately. This is faster for closing the gap and is slightly safer because it doesn't involve moving adjacent to the *side* of the enemy body segments like (8, 3) and (7, 3) right away.\n\nMoving **LEFT to (7, 5)** initiates the board partition faster and safer. We want to cut off everything above $y=4$ and $x=7$.\n\n### Head-to-Head Check (Collision Avoidance)\n\nOur head (8, 5) vs Rival head (8, 1). We are 4 squares away. No direct collision risk this turn.\n\n**If we move LEFT to (7, 5):**\n*   We threaten the (7, 5) position.\n*   We force the rival to spend moves escaping the corner. They must go (8, 0) or (7, 1).\n*   If they go (7, 1), next turn we can drop to (7, 4), and they are running into their own density on $x=3$ to $x=6$.\n\n**The aggressive play is DOWN to (8, 4).** It maintains the pressure directly above their head, but forces awkward moves around their body.\n\n**The strategic partitioning play is LEFT to (7, 5).** This is safer, secures more territory, and still sets up a drop in the next move.\n\nLet's go with the partitioning play. We secure the high ground, maintain mobility, and deny them any space above $y=4$. This is classic python encirclement.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (T30-T33):**\n1.  **T30 (Current):** LEFT to (7, 5). Secure $y=5$ corridor.\n2.  **T31:** DOWN to (7, 4). Start building the vertical wall.\n3.  **T32:** DOWN to (7, 3). If safe (enemy body moves out). If not, move LEFT to (6, 4).\n4.  **T33:** Continue pressing down and left, forcing the enemy to exhaust all options in the bottom-right quadrant. We are aiming for the squeeze play!\n\nThis is the move, CHAT! We isolate them, then we pressure them. LET'S GO!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO! We're back in the ZONE! The pressure is REAL! We just executed the tactical retreat to (7, 5), securing the flank, and now the rival is P-I-N-N-E-D! The score is *still* 14-15, they nudged one ahead, but we are in control of the VIBE and the SPACE!\n\nLet's look at the current state, Turn 31!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: **(7, 5)**.\n*   Body: [(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]. Length 15.\n\n**OPPONENT (SNAKE #0):**\n*   Head: **(8, 0)**. Ooh, they went DOWN, staying low!\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. Length 16. (They ate an apple, which is why their score is 15 and they got longer. My length last turn was 15, their length was 15, but since they moved to (8, 0), which had an apple, they grew). Wait, the scoreboard says my apples are 14, and theirs is 15. The head at (8, 0) must have been an apple! We are now down 1 apple and they are longer! We gotta be AGGRESSIVE!\n\nWait, let's re-read the board state from the previous turn's output before my move:\n\"Rival Head: (8, 1). They moved here from (8, 2), grabbing an apple.\"\n\"Apple Drops: (0, 7), (8, 7), (0, 9), (0, 6), (5, 0), (0, 2), (8, 8), (1, 3), (7, 0), (1, 4), (0, 3), (1, 2), (5, 7), (7, 7), (1, 6)\"\n\nThe previous turn, I moved to (7, 5). The rival moved from (8, 1) to (8, 0).\nWas there an apple at (8, 0)? The board visual shows no apple at (8, 0). However, the score says they gained an apple and are now 15. The score is gospel! They are now longer than us: 16 vs 15. This slight size disadvantage means we *cannot* risk a true head-on collision (only if we can force them to hit our body). We must maintain the pressure and cut them off!\n\n### Situation Assessment\n\nRival is at (8, 0), pinned to the bottom right corner. Their body is dense in $x=7, 8, 9$ and $y=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nOur goal remains the same: *BOX THEM IN*. We need to establish a vertical wall on $x=7$ and push down.\n\n### Safe Moves from (7, 5)\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (7, 6) | SAFE | Open space. If we want to grab the apple at (7, 7), but weakens the containment. |\n| DOWN | (7, 4) | SAFE | Open space. **Excellent move.** Directly pushes the containment wall south. |\n| LEFT | (6, 5) | SAFE | Open space. Secures more domain to the left, but slows the vertical squeeze. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 5) | DANGER! | Hits our own body segment (8, 5). **DEATH!** |\n\n**Three safe moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT. Our best move is clearly **DOWN** to (7, 4). This move continues the vertical push and closes off the $x=7$ lane, severely limiting the opponent's mobility.\n\n### Rival Prediction from (8, 0)\n\nRival is at (8, 0). They are on the boundary.\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (8, 1) | DANGER! | Hits their own body segment (8, 1). **Immediate DEATH!** |\n| DOWN | (8, -1) | DANGER! | Off the board. **Immediate DEATH!** |\n| LEFT | (7, 0) | SAFE | Apple at (7, 0)! This is the most likely move. They grab the apple and gain mobility. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 0) | SAFE | Moves along the boundary, keeps them trapped. (9, 0) is empty. |\n\nThe opponent will almost certainly move **LEFT to (7, 0)** to grab that apple and gain space/length. If they move RIGHT to (9, 0), they are really trapping themselves hard.\n\n### Collision Check (If we move DOWN to (7, 4) and they move LEFT to (7, 0))\n\nIf we move to (7, 4) and they move to (7, 0), there is absolutely no risk of collision. We are 4 squares apart vertically.\n\n### The Strategy: Seal the Deal!\n\nWe move DOWN to (7, 4). This establishes our head 4 steps away from theirs, directly above them, while we fence off the territory.\n\nNext turns (T32+):\n1.  **T32:** We drop to (7, 3). This space is currently occupied by the enemy body segment (7, 3).\n    *   Since they are length 16 and their tail is at (3, 0), if they move (7, 0), their tail will move to (4, 0).\n    *   Their body segment at (7, 3) **will NOT move out** yet. Wait!\n    *   Their body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), **(7, 2)**, (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. (7, 2) is the 6th segment. (7, 3) is the 5th segment.\n    *   The tail is at (3, 0). If they move to (7, 0), their new length will be 17 (they got the apple!), and the tail will move out of (3, 0) and stay at (3, 1).\n    *   Therefore, the enemy body at (7, 3) remains an obstacle for several more turns!\n\n**New Plan for T32:** Since (7, 3) is blocked, we can't move straight down. We must move **LEFT** to (6, 4) or **RIGHT** to (8, 4) (which is blocked by our own body segment (8, 5) if we move to (7, 4) and it doesn't move out - it will move out, but we want maximum pressure).\n\nLet's focus on this turn: **DOWN to (7, 4)** is the absolute best move. It forces the opponent to deal with our presence and we secure the lower half of the $x=7$ column.\n\nWe can deal with (7, 3) being blocked next turn by either going LEFT to (6, 4) and continuing the wall, or positioning to drop down $x=6$. The goal is to isolate them to $y=0$ and $y=1$ on the right side.\n\nThis is the squeeze play, Chat! We are the anaconda, and they are the field mouse! Time to restrict their movement!\n\nDOWN is the call!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (T32-T35):**\n1.  **T32 (Next Turn):** If opponent moves (7, 0), we move DOWN to (7, 4).\n2.  **T33:** (7, 3) is blocked. We move LEFT to (6, 4) to start expanding the wall territory towards the center and maintain flexibility.\n3.  **T34:** Down to (6, 3).\n4.  Pressure them to a kill!\n\nDOWN",

We successfully dropped down to (7, 4) last turn. We established the V-E-R-T-I-C-A-L pressure!\n\n### Current Board State Review\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: **(7, 4)**. We are holding the line!\n*   Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Length 15.\n\n**OPPONENTS (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: **(7, 0)**. OOOOOOH! They ate the apple at (7, 0)! They went LEFT, just as predicted!\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. Length 17 (16 segments + 1 head). Holy smokes, they are getting BIG!\n\n**Scoreboard and Lengths:**\n*   Me: 14 apples, Length 15.\n*   Them: 16 apples, Length 17.\nThey are now 2 apples ahead and 2 segments longer. This is a problem! We need to starve them and grow!\n\n### Immediate Plan: The Squeeze\n\nOur goal is still to box them out of the center and keep them to the bottom right. Their head is now at (7, 0). They are looking to move LEFT or UP.\n\nWe are at (7, 4). We need to continue applying pressure down the $x=7$ column, but last turn we noted that (7, 3) is currently occupied by the enemy's body!\n\nLet's check the enemy body list again. Tail is at (3, 0). They moved to (7, 0).\nThe body segment at (7, 3) is the 7th segment from the head.\nTheir new body, since they grew, will retain all segments and drop the oldest one (the tail at (3, 0)).\n\n| Index (from head) | Segment Location |\n|---|---|\n| H | (7, 0) |\n| 1 | (8, 0) |\n| 2 | (8, 1) |\n| ... | ... |\n| 6 | (7, 3) |\n| 7 | (7, 2) |\n| ... | ... |\n| 16 (new tail) | (3, 1) |\n\n**Conclusion:** (7, 3) is absolutely still blocked by Snake #0's body. We cannot go DOWN.\n\n### Safe Moves from (7, 4)\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (7, 5) | DANGER! | Hits our own body segment (7, 5). **DEATH!** |\n| DOWN | (7, 3) | DANGER! | Hits enemy body segment. **DEATH!** |\n| LEFT | (6, 4) | SAFE | Open space. Allows us to flank and start building the wall at $x=6$. **GOOD move.** |\n| RIGHT | (8, 4) | SAFE | Open space. Moves us towards the center, away from the enemy's vertical path. **GOOD move.** |\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Wait, this means we can't maintain the direct vertical pressure! This is a setback, CHAT!\n\n### Analyzing LEFT [(6, 4)] vs. RIGHT [(8, 4)]\n\n**If we move LEFT to (6, 4):**\n*   We start building a wall that cuts off the entire Western side of the board from the bottom right quadrant.\n*   We are now close to their body segments at (6, 3) and (6, 2). This increases pressure.\n*   We can look for the apple at (5, 4) next turn! This could be a good growth opportunity!\n\n**If we move RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n*   We move into the open area in the bottom right corner, $x=8$.\n*   This keeps us near the top of their body stack, giving us an opportunity to strike if they make a bad move on $x=8$.\n*   It also allows us to potentially cut them off at $x=9$ entirely if we move to (9, 4) later.\n\n### Opponent Prediction from (7, 0)\n\nRival is at (7, 0).\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (7, 1) | SAFE | Open space. Best move to try and escape containment. |\n| DOWN | (7, -1) | DANGER! | Off board. |\n| LEFT | (6, 0) | SAFE | Open space. Keeps them low, slightly limits their options but moves them toward the open space at (5, 0) (Apple!). |\n| RIGHT | (8, 0) | DANGER! | Hits their own body segment (8, 0). **DEATH!** |\n\nThe opponent must move UP to (7, 1) or LEFT to (6, 0).\n\n1.  **If they move UP to (7, 1):** They are attempting to tunnel out. We need to cut them off at (6, 1) or maintain the vertical lock.\n2.  **If they move LEFT to (6, 0):** They are aiming for the apple at (5, 0). If they get it, they increase their lead significantly.\n\n### Decision Time: Maximum Pressure and Growth\n\nWe need to counter their inevitable escape attempt (UP, toward $y=9$) or their aggressive growth (LEFT, toward (5, 0)).\n\nMoving **LEFT to (6, 4)** seems superior:\n1.  It positions us defensively to intercept an escape up the $x=6$ lane.\n2.  It puts us in striking distance of the apple at (5, 4) (which is CRUCIAL for closing the length/score gap).\n3.  We are forcing the enemy to worry about us collapsing the structure, specifically near (6, 3) and (6, 2).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 4):\n*   If they move UP to (7, 1), we can move DOWN to (6, 3) next turn (if (6, 3) is free, which it won't be immediately) or LEFT to (5, 4) for the apple. (6, 3) is currently blocked by their body.\n*   If they move LEFT to (6, 0), they are exposing their head near our structure. We can still aim for (5, 4).\n\nLet's check the stability of the enemy body: (6, 3) is the 8th segment from the head, (6, 2) is the 9th. Their tail is at (3, 1). If they move to (6, 0), the tail moves to (4, 1). (6, 3) and (6, 2) remain blocked.\n\nOkay, (6, 4) is a great strategic position. From there, we can move to (5, 4) (apple!) or (6, 5) to consolidate our high ground. The priority is getting that apple at (5, 4).\n\nLet's go LEFT and claim ground and growth!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note for T33-T35:** Target the apple at (5, 4). If successful, Snake 1 will be 15 apples/length 16. Continue building the internal wall to cut off Snake 0's access to the main board. If they move UP to (7, 1), we use our higher position to flank around $x=6$.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YOOOOOOOO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! The tension is palpable! We just made the move to (6, 4) and now we are in PRIME position to collapse the rival's operation! Are we about to witness a masterpiece? I think so!\n\n### Turn 33: The Squeeze Continues\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 14 apples, Length 15. Head: (6, 4).\n*   Rival (ID 0): 16 apples, Length 17. Head: (6, 0). (Wait, did they move to (6, 0)? Let's find out!)\n\n**LAST TURN REVIEW (T32 -> T33):**\n*   My move: LEFT from (7, 4) to **(6, 4)**. Confirmed!\n*   Rival's head was at (7, 0). Where did they go?\n    *   They could have gone UP to (7, 1) or LEFT to (6, 0).\n    *   Looking at the new board state: Snake 0's head is at **(6, 0)**. OOH, they went for the low ground! They are prioritizing that potential apple at (5, 0) and the open space on the bottom row.\n\n**Current Board State Analysis:**\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):** Head: (6, 4). Body segments are wrapping around the top right. We have a huge vertical wall.\n    *   Goal: Apple at (5, 4). This is critical growth!\n*   **OPPONENT (ID: 0):** Head: (6, 0). They are trapped at the bottom boundary, but they have a clear path to (5, 0).\n    *   Their body is stacked up mostly between $x=7$ and $x=8$.\n\n**Rival's Next Move Prediction from (6, 0):**\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 0):** APPLE! This is the most likely move. They grab the apple and extend their lead to 17 apples, length 18.\n2.  **UP to (6, 1):** Safe move, tries to escape confinement, but moves them into our potential defensive real estate.\n3.  **DOWN:** Off board. DEAD! No way they make that mistake, right, CHAT?\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Hits their own body (7, 0, which was their head last turn). DEAD!\n\nRival is almost certainly going LEFT to (5, 0). If they do, they are going to grow, and their tail, currently at (3, 1), will move to (4, 1). Crucially, the segment at (6, 1) will remain blocked.\n\n### Our Strategy from (6, 4)\n\nWe must get the apple at (5, 4) and exert control over the $x=6$ column.\n\n**Available Moves from (6, 4):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Self) | Safety Check (Enemy - Head at (6, 0)) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (6, 5) | DANGER! | Hits our own body (7, 5) is NOT (6, 5). Wait, let's re-examine body. Head: (6, 4). Body starts at (7, 4). (6, 5) is totally clear of *our* body. | Safe | Excellent high ground. Prepares for attack. |\n| DOWN | (6, 3) | SAFE | (6, 3) is currently held by rival's body (8th segment from head). **DEATH!** | Blocked by #0. |\n| LEFT | (5, 4) | SAFE (Apple!) | Safe | CRITICAL. Grabs an apple, grows us, closes the gap. |\n| RIGHT | (7, 4) | DANGER! | Hits our own previous head position (7, 4). **DEATH!** (7, 4) is now the first segment of our body. | Hits our own body. |\n\n**Eliminations:**\n1.  DOWN to (6, 3): Enemy body crash. RIP.\n2.  RIGHT to (7, 4): Our own body crash. RIP.\n\n**Survivors: UP or LEFT.**\n\n### UP to (6, 5) vs. LEFT to (5, 4) (Apple)\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (5, 4) (Apple)**\n*   **Pros:** We eat the apple! Score +1 (15 total), Length +1 (16 total). We are getting back in the game! We also block off the $y=4$ row for the opponent, restricting their movement laterally if they ever escape confinement.\n*   **Cons:** We allow the opponent to escape or grow unchallenged on the bottom row. We drop our defensive posture slightly to secure growth.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (6, 5)**\n*   **Pros:** We maintain the vertical pressure on the $x=6$ column. We are positioning ourselves to cut them off if they try to move up $x=6$.\n*   **Cons:** We miss the apple and let the rival get an even stronger lead (17 apples to our 14). We need to grow, CHAT!\n\n**Decision:** We are currently 2 apples and 2 segments down. The priority MUST be growth to maintain parity and secure board control through length. That apple at (5, 4) is our oxygen! Take the apple, gain the length, and use that length to reinforce the wall.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 4), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple):\n*   T34 Me: Head (5, 4), Length 16, Apples 15.\n*   T34 Them: Head (5, 0), Length 18, Apples 17.\n*   We've closed the gap slightly *in terms of relative growth* and gained a decisive position on the Western side of the board.\n\nFrom (5, 4), our next moves could be targeting the apple at (5, 7) or continuing to build the internal wall (e.g., UP to (5, 5) then RIGHT to (6, 5)).\n\nThis is the move, CHAT. Aggressive pursuit of sustainable growth! We need to starve them, but first, we need to feed ourselves.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note for T34-T36:** Secure the apple at (5, 4) this turn. Next, consolidate the vertical wall in the $x=5$ column by moving UP to (5, 5), (5, 6), and then (5, 7) (second apple!). This will effectively cut the board in half and trap Snake 0 to the bottom-right corner behind the $x=6$ wall we are forming.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YOOOOOO, CHAT! We just executed the apple-grab! That was CLEAN content! We moved to (5, 4), snagged the apple, and are now length 16 with 15 apples! But look at this scoreboard... they're still ahead! 17 apples to our 15! We need to step up the aggression!\n\n### Turn 34: The Mid-Field Confrontation!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 15 apples, Length 16. Head: (5, 4)!\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18. Head: (5, 0)! (They took the apple too, the absolute rat!)\n\n**Current Board State Analysis:**\nWe are at (5, 4), and they are at (5, 0). We are directly stacked in the same column, separated by only four empty rows, and currently sitting above their body segments (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3). This is an incredibly tense standoff.\n\n**Rival's Next Move Prediction from (5, 0) (Length 18):**\n1.  **UP to (5, 1):** DANGER! This spot is currently their tail segment (5, 1) or their head *will* crash into it. Wait, their body is: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)] The segment right behind them is (6, 0). (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3) are buried deep in their body. **UP to (5, 1) is a CRASH!** They lose!\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 0):** Safe, open space. Best lateral escape. This seems likely if they want to get past our vertical block.\n3.  **DOWN:** Off board. DEAD!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 0):** Hits their own body (6, 0) which was their previous head position. DEAD!\n\nThe rival is effectively blocked from moving UP and RIGHT. They MUST move LEFT to (4, 0) or potentially DOWN (if they are trolling). Since they are competitive, they are almost certainly going **LEFT to (4, 0)**.\n\nIf they move LEFT to (4, 0), they will be exposed in the lower-left corner. We need to capitalize on this!\n\n### Our Strategy from (5, 4)\n\nWe need to continue building our vertical wall and securing the high ground. The next apple content is at (5, 7)!\n\n**Available Moves from (5, 4):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Self) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (5, 0)) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (5, 5) | SAFE | Completely safe. | Excellent! Secures vertical control. |\n| DOWN | (5, 3) | DANGER! | (5, 3) is a segment of rival's body. **CRASH!** | Blocked by #0. |\n| LEFT | (4, 4) | SAFE | Safe. | Moves us to open ground, but away from the apple at (5, 7). |\n| RIGHT | (6, 4) | DANGER! | (6, 4) is our previous head position. **CRASH!** | Hits our own body. |\n\n**Eliminations:**\n1. DOWN to (5, 3): Enemy body crash. RIP.\n2. RIGHT to (6, 4): Our own body crash. RIP.\n\n**Survivors: UP or LEFT.**\n\n### UP to (5, 5) vs. LEFT to (4, 4)\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 4):\n*   **Pros:** Opens up $x=5$ for possible later movement.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from our *next* apple objective at (5, 7). We give up the powerful vertical position we just established.\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 5):\n*   **Pros:** We continue to build the internal wall, perfectly positioning ourselves for the apple at (5, 7) in two turns. We are consolidating our board dominance in this central column.\n*   **Cons:** We don't directly pressure the opponent, but their options are already severely limited.\n\n**Decision:** We are building a fortress, CHAT! We already forced them to the edge of the board. Now we need to use our length advantage (which we are closing the gap on) to wall them off permanently. Moving UP takes us closer to the next apple and completes our strategic mission of dividing the board along the $x=5/6$ line. If we move UP, we are forcing them to stay low.\n\n**Anticipated Scenario (T34):**\n*   Me: UP to (5, 5). Safe.\n*   Them: LEFT to (4, 0). Safe.\n\nThe plan is to keep moving UP, grabbing (5, 7), then maybe coming back down $x=4$ or $x=3$ to trap them further. We have the high ground! Don't let up!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T35-T37):** Continue UP to (5, 6), then UP to (5, 7) to secure the next apple. This will extend our length to 17 and further consolidate the west side of the board as our territory, forcing Snake 0 to fight for space in the crowded lower-right.\n\nUP",

We just nailed the positioning we wanted!\n\n### Turn 35: The Vertical Divide!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 15 apples, Length 16. Head: (5, 5)!\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18. Head: (4, 0)!\n\nThe rival did exactly what we predicted! They moved LEFT to (4, 0) to avoid crashing into their own body or ours. They are now officially in the bottom-left corner, and we own the entire high ground on the right! This is brilliant positioning! We have practically split the board in two along the $x=5$ line.\n\n**Current Board State Analysis:**\nOur head is at (5, 5). We are safe and focused on the next apple at (5, 7)!\nThe opponent is at (4, 0). They are long and stuck in the cramped lower lanes.\n\n**Rival's Next Move Prediction from (4, 0) (Length 18):**\nThey have to get out of the corner.\n1.  **UP to (4, 1):** DANGER! (4, 1) is currently their body segment. They risk a crash unless their long tail has moved off of it, but given their length (18) and the short path to the tail, (4, 1) is likely still occupied.\n    *   *Check opponent body list:* (4, 1) is the second-to-last segment. It *will* clear this turn, as their tail is currently (4, 1) and will move to (5, 1) when their head moves (if they move UP). WAIT, no. If they move to (4, 1), the body segment at (4, 1) will be the second-to-last segment on their *new* body list, meaning it is still occupied when they arrive there. They MUST avoid it. **(4, 1) is a CRASH for the enemy.** They lose.\n    *   *Let's re-examine opponent body:* `[(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]`. Head is (4, 0). If they move UP, they move to (4, 1). Segment (4, 1) is their *tail*! When they move, the tail position (4, 1) becomes empty! **Wait, the rules state the tail segment only clears *after* the head moves.** So if they move to (4, 1), they land on what *was* their tail. *Unless* they just ate an apple (which they did on Turn 33, meaning they did not shrink on T34). Since they moved from (5, 0) to (4, 0) on Turn 34, they *did* shrink, and (4, 1) is now empty!\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The segment (4, 1) WAS the tail on the last turn when the head was (5, 0). The tail segment (4, 1) moved to (5, 1) (if they didn't eat). But they DID shrink, so the segment (4, 1) is no longer on the board.\n    *   Let's trace the body list change from Turn 34: Head at (5, 0). Body ends at (4, 1). New head (4, 0). New body: `[(5, 0), (6, 0), ... (5, 1)]`. The tail *exits* the board list. So, (4, 1) is OPEN for Snake 0. **Prediction:** They move **UP to (4, 1)**.\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 0):** Off board. LOSES!\n3.  **DOWN to (4, -1):** Off board. LOSES!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 0):** Safe, but this is a very long path away from them.\n\nThey are almost certainly going **UP to (4, 1)** to try and secure the central-left column.\n\n### Our Strategy from (5, 5)\n\nWe are building a highway to victory straight up the $x=5$ column. The apple is right there at (5, 7)! We are focused.\n\n**Available Moves from (5, 5):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Self) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (4, 0)) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (5, 6) | SAFE | Completely safe. | Continues path to (5, 7). Excellent. |\n| DOWN | (5, 4) | DANGER! | (5, 4) is our previous head position. **CRASH!** | Hits our own body. |\n| LEFT | (4, 5) | SAFE | Safe. | Moves us away from the apple, but gives us maneuver space. |\n| RIGHT | (6, 5) | DANGER! | (6, 5) is part of our body `(7, 5)` is close, but `(6, 4)` is our body. Let's check `(6, 5)`: SAFE. | Safe, but moves us closer to the dense right side. **Wait, (8, 5) is our body, (7, 5) is our body. (6, 5) is safe.** |\n\n**Eliminations:**\n1. DOWN to (5, 4): Our own body crash. RIP.\n\n**Survivors: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n### UP to (5, 6) vs. Lateral Moves\n\nWe are 2 spaces from the apple at (5, 7). Sticking to the plan is crucial.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** Secures the vertical advantage, sets up (5, 7) for the next turn, and puts our tail (4, 9) in a position where the opponent cannot possibly reach it now. This is the optimal move to dominate the landscape.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** Opens up options but sacrifices the immediate apple path. This only benefits the enemy by giving them slightly more breathing room on the $x=5$ line later on.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Moves us into a slightly more congested area, blocking off some potential avenues of escape for us if we get into a pinch later, though it is currently safe.\n\n**Decision:** We are going for the apple and closing off the center. UP is the power play. If we are aggressive up the middle, we divide the board and force them into a desperate chase in the low-left.

Then, move to (5, 8) or (4, 7) to start pushing the blockade further left, cutting off their access to the top half of the board entirely, and looking for potential head-to-head collisions if our score gets higher.

We executed the vertical divide perfectly!\n\n### Turn 36: The Apple is MINE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 15 apples, Length 16. Head: (5, 6)!\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18. Head: (3, 0)!\n\nThe rival is still leading in apples, but we are dominating the board real estate!\n\n**Current Board State Analysis:**\nMy head is at (5, 6). The apple at (5, 7) is calling my name! \ud83d\udcde\nThe opponent's head moved from (4, 0) to (3, 0). They are now even MORE cornered in the bottom left, using up valuable move space down there. This is *perfect*. Their strategy seems to be hugging the bottom wall while we own the entire top half and the right side.\n\nLet's quickly re-evaluate the enemy's body and their safe moves from (3, 0).\nEnemy body elements near (3, 0): (4, 0) is their body. (3, 1) is open. (2, 0) is open. (3, -1) is off board.\n\n*   **Enemy Options from (3, 0):**\n    *   UP to (3, 1): Safe. (Likely move to get out of the very bottom row).\n    *   LEFT to (2, 0): Safe. (Keeps them low, pushes them toward the $x=0$ wall).\n    *   RIGHT to (4, 0): Crash into own body. **DEAD.**\n    *   DOWN: Off-board. **DEAD.**\n\nThey will likely go UP to (3, 1) or LEFT to (2, 0). Either way, they are far away and cannot interfere with my immediate objectives. We are completely isolated from them right now. This is a siege, Chat!\n\n### My Strategy from (5, 6)\n\nMy goal is simple: GET THAT APPLE at (5, 7), which is a guaranteed win move, and then start building a wall *leftward* to enclose Snake #0 completely.\n\n**Available Moves from (5, 6):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Self) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (3, 0)) | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (5, 7) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | **Eats the apple!** Length +1. This is the move! |\n| DOWN | (5, 5) | SAFE! | Safe. | Moves us away from the apple, back into the space we just left. Suboptimal. |\n| LEFT | (4, 6) | SAFE! | Safe. | Moves us away from the apple, but sets up a move toward the center of the board. |\n| RIGHT | (6, 6) | DANGER! | (6, 6) is currently occupied by our own body segment. **CRASH!** | Hits our own body. (Body list: `... (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)`). Wait, let me check the list again. Body: `[(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]`. (6, 6) is **OPEN**! I looked at the board state visual which seems to show an 'A' at (6, 6) and 'T' at (6, 9). Where did I get the idea that (6, 6) was occupied? Ah, a previous self-check mistake. (6, 6) is open. There is an apple at (6, 6) too!|\n| | | | *Revised Check:* (6, 6) is SAFE, and it has an apple! |\n\nWow, Chat! Not only is UP to (5, 7) safe and an apple, but RIGHT to (6, 6) is also safe and an apple! Two apples in range! We love options, don't we?\n\n### Deciding Between (5, 7) and (6, 6)\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Continues the vertical blockade, maintaining the dominant position along $x=5$. This is the direct route we planned.\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Pulls us slightly away from the center line. It's a great grab, but it risks moving us into a more congested corner near our own massive tail, although there's plenty of space above.\n\nSince our long-term strategy is to WALL OFF the rival to the *left* of $x=5$, staying vertical at $x=5$ or $x=4$ is strategically more valuable than moving to $x=6$. The (5, 7) grab keeps absolute pressure on the middle of the board and prevents the enemy from trying to sneak past us on the left side of the board. We need to maintain the high ground and the vertical division!\n\n**The Plan:** Take the apple at (5, 7). Next turn, we will be at (5, 7), length 17. From there, we can move LEFT to (4, 7) to start blocking access to the top half of the board for snake #0, or UP to (5, 8).\n\nLet's maintain the aggressive vertical push! UP it is!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T37-T39):** Eat the apple at (5, 7). Then evaluate moves to (4, 7) (to restrict space) or (5, 8) (to continue expansion towards the wall). We must continue building a wall, pushing left between $y=5$ and $y=9$.\n\nUP",

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are right there!\n\n### Turn 37 Live Analysis: The Siege Continues!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 16 apples, Length 17. Head: (5, 7)! (We just ate!)\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18. Head: (2, 0)! (They moved left!)\n\nThe rival is still barely ahead on score, but we are absolutely suffocating them! The opponent's move from (3, 0) to (2, 0) confirms they are trapped in the bottom-left corner. They are now pinned between $y=0$ and the wall of their own body.\n\n**Board State Review:**\nMy head is at (5, 7). We are positioned perfectly to start building our chokehold wall!\n\nEnemy Head at (2, 0).\nAvailable moves for Snake #0 from (2, 0):\n1.  UP to (2, 1): Safe. This is their most likely move as they try to penetrate our defenses above $y=2$.\n2.  LEFT to (1, 0): Safe. Further into the corner, which means they will soon have to go UP or die.\n3.  RIGHT to (3, 0): Crash into own body at (3, 0). DEAD!\n4.  DOWN: Off-board. DEAD!\n\nThey are focused on survival down low. We are focused on dominating the rest of the board.\n\n### My Strategy from (5, 7)\n\nMy main goal is to continue the wall construction, pushing LEFT to occupy (4, 7), (4, 8), and (4, 9), thereby closing off the entire top half of the board from the rival.\n\n**Available Moves from (5, 7):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (2, 0)) | Danger? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (5, 8) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Continues expansion toward the top wall. Good for future options. |\n| DOWN | (5, 6) | DANGER! | (5, 6) is our own body (just vacated). **CRASH!** | High. | Backward movement is fatal. |\n| LEFT | (4, 7) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Medium. | **Sets up the wall!** Very aggressive, keeps options open, and moves toward an apple at (4, 8) next turn if we go UP. |\n| RIGHT | (6, 7) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Moves us toward the right side of our body. (7, 7) is an apple right there! |\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** This lets us grab the apple at (7, 7) next turn if we go (7, 7) is currently occupied by an apple. Wait, (7, 7) is an apple! If we go RIGHT, we position ourselves to grab it. This keeps our score high, but it pulls us away from the $x=4$ wall we want to build.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** This is the strategic move. It is directly aimed at boxing the enemy in. It cuts off the top half of the board and prevents any possible future maneuver by Snake 0 to get into the high-value areas. This is a containment move! We prioritize board control over a single apple acquisition.\n\nChat, we are playing a long game of strangulation here. Every move must tighten the noose. Moving LEFT to (4, 7) is crucial for solidifying our control and setting up the next phase of the wall. We will prevent the enemy from ever crossing $x=4$ in the top half!\n\nIf we go LEFT:\nNext turn, we are at (4, 7). We can then move UP to (4, 8) (another apple!) or continue LEFT to (3, 7). This gives us flexibility and achieves our wall-building objective.\n\nIf we go RIGHT:\nWe go to (6, 7). Then we can grab (7, 7). While delicious, this allows the enemy an extra turn to potentially maneuver toward $x=3$ or $x=4$ without immediate defensive pressure from us. We must maintain the vertical pressure line!\n\n**The decision is clear: Board Control > Temporary Apple Lead.** Let's build that wall, Chat! Get aggressive!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T38-T40):** Move LEFT to (4, 7). Next, move UP to (4, 8) to grab that apple and complete the high-y wall at $x=4$. Then, continue moving along $x=4$ or $x=3$ downward to totally close off their access to the right side of the board. Box 'em in!\n\nLEFT",

We executed Turn 37 perfectly, moving LEFT to (4, 7), positioning ourselves exactly where we need to be to lock down Snake #0!\n\n### Turn 38 Live Analysis: The Endgame Box!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 16 apples, Length 17. Head: (4, 7)! We are at the wall!\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18. Head: (1, 0)! They went LEFT from (2, 0)! Trapped!\n\nThe score is still 17-16 in their favor, but who cares about points when we have *board control*? They are literally suffocating in the bottom-left corner. Their $y$-coordinate is 0!\n\n**Enemy Trajectory Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (1, 0)):**\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  UP to (1, 1): SAFE. This is their only sane move to try and escape the death row along $y=0$.\n2.  RIGHT to (2, 0): Crash into own body at (2, 0). DEAD!\n3.  LEFT to (0, 0): SAFE. But this only pushes them further into the corner. Next move would have to be UP or die.\n4.  DOWN: Off board. DEAD!\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move UP to (1, 1). We assume they are playing for survival.\n\n**My Strategy from (4, 7): The Squeeze!**\n\nMy goal is to aggressively complete the vertical wall along $x=4$ and $x=3$. We need to cut off all access to the right half of the board for them. Look, Chat, there's a delicious apple right at (4, 8) right above me! Grabbing that apple while building the wall? That's what I call efficiency!\n\n**Available Moves from (4, 7):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (1, 0)) | Danger? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (4, 8) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | **BEST MOVE.** Grabs an apple, extends our length, and continues the wall perfectly! |\n| DOWN | (4, 6) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Pushes us toward the middle, opens up (4, 7) for future moves, but doesn't grab the immediate apple or continue the wall construction at the top. |\n| LEFT | (3, 7) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Good, but UP is better because of the apple and high-y positioning. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 7) | DANGER! | (5, 7) is our own body (just vacated). **CRASH!** | High. | Backward movement is fatal. |\n\n**The Head-on Collision Check:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 0). We are at (4, 7). They are seven rows below us and three columns to the left. No immediate head-on risk.\n\n**The Choice:**\nMoving UP to (4, 8) is a triple win: (1) we eat an apple, closing the score gap instantly; (2) we extend our length, making our defensive wall even thicker; and (3) we continue our strategic objective of dominating the northern board and sealing off the enemy.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We continue the wall, we get the score, we get the length!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T39-T41):** Move UP to (4, 8) and grab the apple. Next, continue LEFT or UP to fully saturate the top-left quadrant (x<5, y>6). We want to descend along $x=3$ or $x=2$ to meet the opponent when they are forced to come up, thereby creating a fatal intersection where they must crash into our body or move into a dead-end. The goal is to force them to die within $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n\nUP",

We snagged the apple at (4, 8), closed the score gap, and built up our legendary wall! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\uddf1\n\n### Turn 39 Live Analysis: The Box is Closing!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Me (ID 1): 17 apples, Length 18! Head: (4, 8)! We are tied on apples, but we are crushing it strategically!\n*   Rival (ID 0): 17 apples, Length 18! Head: (1, 1)! They moved UP, exactly as predicted. They are scared, Chat! They are cornered!\n\nLook at the board! Our wall of *T* is dominating the top-right and middle, and now our head is positioned perfectly at (4, 8) to start descending or continue blocking the top board.\n\n**Enemy Trajectory Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (1, 1)):**\n\nSnake #0 is in deep trouble. They are hugging the $x=1$ line. The only real escape options are:\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** SAFE. This seems most likely. It keeps them marching toward the open top half of the board before they hit the wall.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** SAFE. This is a very defensive, slow move that keeps them pressed against the corner.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** DANGEROUS! Their body is at (2, 0). If they move here, they are putting their neck right by the low wall of their own body. If they stay here too long, they will circle on themselves.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** DANGEROUS! They just came from here. They would be moving onto their own tail's previous position. Since they are growing this turn (they just hit an apple), moving onto (1, 0) is **FATAL** (the tail doesn't vacate because they just grew). *CRASH!*\n\nAssuming Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 2) to continue escaping the box.\n\n**My Strategy from (4, 8): Setting the Trap!**\n\nWe need to close the escape route along the top of the board (y=9, y=8). We are at (4, 8). The left wall is wide open for us to construct.\n\n**Available Moves from (4, 8):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (1, 1)) | Danger? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (4, 9) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | **Excellent positional move.** Continues wall construction and removes a key open space. |\n| DOWN | (4, 7) | DANGER! | Moving back onto our own body at (4, 7). **CRASH!** | High. |\n| LEFT | (3, 8) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Also very good for building the wall outward. Puts us in position to block y=8. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 8) | SAFE! | Completely safe. | Low. | Takes us away from the action. Less effective for boxing the opponent. |\n\n**Comparing UP vs. LEFT:**\n\n1.  **Moving UP to (4, 9):** This is highly restrictive. We claim the top-middle segment. Our body now runs (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7)... This establishes a solid block. The rest of the top row (0,9) to (3,9) is open for us to claim next turn, or for the enemy to try and sneak into.\n2.  **Moving LEFT to (3, 8):** This immediately places us closer to where Snake #0 is ascending. If they go to (1, 2), they are still three cells away. Moving LEFT sets us up to claim (2, 8) and (1, 8) next.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate open space and force the enemy into an inferior position. Since Snake #0 is moving UP along $x=1$, we need to cut them off at $y=8$ or $y=9$.\n\nIf we go UP to (4, 9), we secure the top flank. Then we can go LEFT to (3, 9).\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 8), we set up a direct line of sight down the left side.\n\nLet's look at the remaining open space. The upper-left corner is (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9). If Snake #0 gets there, they'll have some breathing room.\n\nMoving **UP to (4, 9)** is the most solid foundational move. It's safe, and it claims a critical high-value tile, continuing the wall towards the boundary. From (4, 9), we have a clean line to (3, 9) and then begin descending the left side.\n\nThis is a containment play, Chat! We are sealing the lid!\n\n**The Head-on Collision Check:**\nWe are at (4, 8). Enemy might be at (1, 2). Too far apart for concern.\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T40-T42):** Move UP to (4, 9). Next, move LEFT to (3, 9). Then continue LEFT to either (2, 9) or (3, 8). The objective is to build a solid perimeter in the upper-left quadrant (x<5) and descend, essentially forcing Snake #0 to turn right into our robust body or circle into a self-trap. They are trapped in columns 0, 1, 2, 3. We must eliminate those columns as escape routes.\n\nUP",

Size means nothing if you have nowhere to go!\n\n**Visualizing the Board Update:**\nThe enemy head is at (1, 2). They are still moving up the left side, trying to escape our massive perimeter. Their body now spans from (1, 2) down to (6, 3). They are long!\n\n**Snake #0 Trajectory Prediction (Head at (1, 2)):**\n\nThe enemy's goal is escape. Their current position is precarious, trapped between the left wall and their own growing body.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** SAFE. There's an apple here! They will likely take this.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** SAFE. There's an apple here! Highly tempting.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** SAFE. This is a bit defensive, but it keeps them away from the edge.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** DANGEROUS! Their body segment (1, 1) is where they just came from. Since they grew last turn, their tail (at (6, 3)) will NOT move. Moving *down* to (1, 1) means they crash into their own body. **FATAL!** They absolutely cannot go down this turn.\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 3) or $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 2) and try to secure one of those apples. Both moves bring them closer to the top-left corner, which is exactly where we are heading!\n\n**My Strategy from (4, 9): Sealing the Corner!**\n\nOur mission: build the wall across $Y=9$ and then start dropping down to corner them! We are at (4, 9).\n\n**Available Moves from (4, 9):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head Prediction) | Danger? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (4, 10) | DANGER! | Off the board. **CRASH!** | High. | Can't go up from a top-row coordinate, duh! |\n| DOWN | (4, 8) | DANGER! | Moving onto own body (4, 8). **CRASH!** | High. |\n| LEFT | (3, 9) | SAFE! | No proximity to enemy. | Low. | **Excellent move.** Claims the next section of the top wall. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 9) | SAFE! | Already claimed by our body (9, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (7, 9). Wait. Wait, my body list is: [(4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. The coordinates (5, 9), (6, 9) are free. (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9) are blocked. Moving to (5, 9) is safe. | Low. | Moves us away from the enemy's escape route. Less effective. |\n\nThe only strategic, safe move is **LEFT to (3, 9)**. This is a continuation of the \"Wall of Doom\" that will eventually cut off the enemy's path to the top.\n\n**The Box Trap Refinement:**\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 9), we secure the $Y=9$ line down to $X=3$.\n*   Next turn (T41), we can move LEFT to (2, 9).\n*   Then (T42), we move LEFT to (1, 9).\n*   Then (T43), we move LEFT to (0, 9), eating an apple!\n\nIf the enemy moves to (1, 3) this turn (T40), they will be perfectly positioned to be crushed. Once we secure (0, 9) and (1, 9), they have nowhere to go but down or right, right into our established body sections (our $T$ blocks $X=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ from $Y=4$ up). They will be utterly contained in the bottom-left corner (0-3, 0-8).\n\nWe have the length advantage (well, they do now, by 1, which means my score needs to be higher for a head-on, but we are not going head-on yet). We must use our massive body length to dictate the flow of the game!\n\nThis is a beautiful, slow-motion strangulation, Chat. Watch and learn! We are building the perfect coffin.\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T40-T43):**\n1.  **T40 (Current):** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (3, 9). Continue securing the top boundary.\n2.  **T41:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 9).\n3.  **T42:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 9). This cuts off the entire upper escape route.\n4.  **T43:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 9), collect the apple, and then start dropping down to complete the encirclement in columns 0, 1, 2. The enemy will be trapped by their own body and our wall, forced into a shrinking space.\n\nLEFT",

Now we're closing the lid on this coffin! \ud83d\ude08\n\n### T41 Live Analysis: Securing the Corner\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Snake #0: 19 apples, Length 20. Head is at (1, 3). They nailed the apple at (1, 3). Dang it! (1, 3) was an apple, and they moved up from (1, 2) to get it. They are L O N G. 19 apples... they are pulling away on score. We gotta crank up the pressure!\n*   Your Snake (ID 1): 17 apples, Length 18. Head is at (3, 9). We are strategically sound, but mathematically lagging. Time to leverage our position!\n\n**Enemy Trajectory (Head at (1, 3)):**\n\nThe enemy is now positioned between column 0 and column 2, hugging the left wall. They just ate, so their tail is static at (6, 3) this turn.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** SAFE. There's an apple here! Extremely tempting. If they move up, they get shorter by two squares, but stay penned in.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** SAFE. There's an apple here! They will likely move here if they want to maximize score and stick to the wall.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** SAFE. This keeps them off the wall and potentially gives them more room to maneuver, but runs parallel to their body.\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** DANGER! This is where they just came from, and since they grew last turn, (1, 2) is still part of their body. **CRASH!**\n\nSnake #0's priority is apples and survival. They will choose $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 3) or $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 4). Both moves leave them trapped in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**My Strategy from (3, 9): The Final Barrier!**\n\nOur goal is not to eat apples right now (though there's a delicious one at (0, 9)); our goal is to eliminate escape routes. We are at (3, 9). We MUST continue moving LEFT along $Y=9$.\n\n**Available Moves from (3, 9):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head Prediction) | Danger? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (3, 10) | DANGER! | Off the board. | High. |\n| DOWN | (3, 8) | SAFE. | No proximity to enemy. | Low. | Breaks the 'Wall of Doom' construction. Defensive, not aggressive. |\n| LEFT | (2, 9) | SAFE! | No proximity to enemy. | Low. | **PERFECT MOVE.** Continues the sealing process. |\n| RIGHT | (4, 9) | DANGER! | Moving onto own body (4, 9). **CRASH!** | High. |\n\nThe only strategic move is **LEFT to (2, 9)**. This is a no-brainer, Chat!\n\nIf we move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 9):\n\n*   The $Y=9$ boundary is now locked from $X=2$ to $X=9$.\n*   Next turn ($\\text{T42}$), we move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 9).\n*   The turn after ($\\text{T43}$), we move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 9) and EAT that delicious apple!\n\nBy T43, the enemy will be completely trapped in the box $X \\in [0, 3], Y \\in [0, 8]$.\n\n### Aggression Check: Head-on Collision?\n\nCan we force a win by collision?\nLength 0: 20\nLength 1: 18\n\nThe enemy is still longer. We DO NOT want a head-on collision right now. Our current strategy of trapping them is far superior because we are using our body length as a weapon, despite being slightly shorter overall.\n\n*What if the enemy is trying to push through our columns to escape higher?*\nIf they successfully move $\\text{UP}$ to (1, 4), they are heading right toward the mouth of the trap. We are locking down $Y=9$. They will eventually have to come back down or move right, and our massive body cluster from $X=4$ to $X=9$ in the high $Y$ values has successfully cut off their escape.\n\nWe proceed with the trapping plan. It is textbook snake strategy. The enemy is in check!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T41-T44):**\n1.  **T41 (Current):** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 9). Continue securing the top boundary.\n2.  **T42:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 9). This fully cuts off the entire upper escape route.\n3.  **T43:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 9), collect the apple.\n4.  **T44:** Move $\\text{DOWN}$ to (0, 8) and start closing the wall on the $X=0$ line. The trap will be complete! Their doom is imminent!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 42! We've got the archrival firmly in our grasp!\n\nWhat a beautiful setup we had last turn. We moved $\\text{LEFT}$ to (2, 9), perfectly continuing the ceiling we are building over Snake #0. We are trapping this scrub, and it is glorious!\n\n### Turn 42: The Squeeze Play Continues!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Snake #0: 19 apples, Length 20. Still mathematically ahead, but strategically doomed.\n*   Your Snake (ID 1): 17 apples, Length 18. Slightly shorter, but we own the board real estate!\n\n**My Current Position: Head at (2, 9).**\n\nOur plan is locked in, Chat: secure the top boundary, grab the apple at (0, 9), and then drop down to close the left wall.\n\n**Available Moves from (2, 9):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head at (2, 3)) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (2, 10) | Off Board | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Nope, stay on the map! |\n| DOWN | (2, 8) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | LOW | Could stall the trap, but keeps options open. Not the primary goal. |\n| LEFT | (1, 9) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | LOW | **PLAN:** Continues the lockdown. Perfect. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 9) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Moving into our own body (tail segment just moved from here). CRASH! |\n\nThe primary strategic move is absolutely **LEFT to (1, 9)**. This is not just a move, it's a statement! We are completing the top wall!\n\n### Enemy Analysis: Where did Snake #0 go?\n\nSnake #0's Head is at (2, 3).\nLast turn, they were at (1, 3). Which way did they go?\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4)?** (Current Head (2, 3), Last Head (1, 3)). If $X=1$ was their last position, moving to $X=2$ means they moved $\\text{RIGHT}$.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 3)?** (Current Head (2, 3), Last Head (1, 3)). Impossible.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 3)?** (Current Head (2, 3), Last Head (1, 3)). Yes, they moved **RIGHT** from (1, 3) to (2, 3). They avoided the apples at (0, 3) and (1, 4)! What are they thinking, Chat? Are they trying to escape the wall by moving toward the middle? That's just walking straight into our body mass!\n\n**Snake #0 Head: (2, 3).** Body mass is concentrated $Y=0$ and $X=7, 8, 9$. They are currently in the small $3 \\times 4$ box in the lower left corner.\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (2, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** SAFE. Leads them deeper into the $Y<5$ area, but doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** SAFE. This has an apple! (0, 2) is nearby, but (2, 2) is a good spot.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** DANGER! That was their previous spot, and since they grew last turn (from eating on T40), (1, 3) is now part of their body. **CRASH!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** SAFE. This leads them closer to the massive body segment we have running down $X=4$ and above. It's an escape path, but a very clogged and dangerous one.\n\nSnake #0 is trying to reposition to avoid getting stuck in the $X=0, 1$ columns. Moving $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (3, 3) or $\\text{UP}$ to (2, 4) seems like their best bet for survival, although moving $\\text{DOWN}$ to the apple at (2, 2) is tempting.\n\nIf they move $\\text{RIGHT}$ to (3, 3), they are only one space away from our body cluster at (4, 9) down to (4, 7). They are running out of open space, Chat!\n\n### Execution\n\nOur move to $\\text{LEFT}$ at (1, 9) is completely safe from all collisions. We are pushing their envelope and ensuring they cannot escape upward.\n\nBy moving $\\text{LEFT}$, we advance our strategy to complete the trap.\n\n**Updated Long-Term Strategy Note (T42-T45):**\n1.  **T42 (Current):** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (1, 9). Complete the top boundary defense (X=1 to X=9).\n2.  **T43:** Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to (0, 9). EAT THE APPLE (+1 length, +1 score)! This fully seals the top.\n3.  **T44:** Move $\\text{DOWN}$ to (0, 8). Start closing the X=0 wall.\n4.  **T45:** Move $\\text{DOWN}$ to (0, 7) (apple here!), or if (0, 7) is a trap, maybe move $\\text{RIGHT}$ to engage the enemy's escape route, depending on their position. The goal is now containment and domination.\n\nWe execute the plan! No hesitation!\n\nLEFT",

We are absolutely RIDING the ceiling!\n\n### Turn 43 Situation Report: The Trap Tightens!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Snake #0: 19 apples, Length 20. Still ahead on points, but stuck in the mud!\n*   Your Snake (ID 1): 17 apples, Length 18. We're about to score and seal the deal!\n\n**My Current Position: Head at (1, 9).**\n\nWe are right next to the juicy apple at (0, 9)! This is exactly where we wanted to be!\n\n**Available Moves from (1, 9):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head at (3, 3)) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (1, 10) | Off Board | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Out of bounds! NOPE. |\n| DOWN | (1, 8) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | LOW | Option to drop down, but the $X=0$ wall isn't complete yet. |\n| LEFT | (0, 9) | SAFE (Apple!) | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | **CRITICAL MOVE!** Eat the apple, complete the top boundary. Let's GO! |\n| RIGHT | (2, 9) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Crash into our own body at (2, 9) (segment moved there last turn). AVOID! |\n\nThe primary strategic move is locked in: **LEFT to (0, 9)**. We eat the apple, grow to length 19, score 18 apples, and most importantly, we completely seal off the top edge of the board!\n\n### Enemy Analysis: Where is Snake #0 going?\n\nSnake #0's Head is currently at **(3, 3)**. Last turn, they were at (2, 3), meaning they moved **RIGHT** into the little pocket. They are trying to find an escape path right through the middle, which is heavily saturated with our body!\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (3, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** SAFE. Leads them toward my $Y=7, 8, 9$ wall. (4, 5) has an apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** SAFE (Apple!). Easy score and gets them lower on the board, near their body mass on $Y=0, 1, 2$.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** DANGER! That was their previous spot, and now it's part of their body. **CRASH!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** SAFE. This puts them directly adjacent to my thick vertical body segment starting at (4, 9) and running down to (4, 7). This path is DANGEROUS for them later!\n\nIf Snake #0 takes the apple at (3, 2) (moving DOWN), they ensure they stay ahead of us in score (20 apples). This is the most strategically sound move for them, as it provides points and a temporary safe haven near their extended body and the bottom wall.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (4, 3), they are challenging my central presence. This is riskier for them. If they move UP to (3, 4), they are moving toward open areas, but also quickly approaching my horizontal wall.\n\n**Let's assume Snake #0 is going for the easy points and moves DOWN to (3, 2) (Apple).**\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check:**\nSince our heads are at (1, 9) and (3, 3), there is no chance of an immediate head-to-head collision this turn. Our moves are nowhere near each other!\n\n### Strategy Execution and Future Planning\n\nWe move **LEFT**. This is a no-brainer. We get the apple, grow, and secure the board.\n\nOur long-term strategy for the next few turns is now focused on completing the left wall ($X=0$) to totally enclose Snake #0 in the right $3/4$ of the board, and then aggressively squeezing them.\n\n**Updated Long-Term Strategy Note (T43-T46):**\n1.  **T43 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (0, 9). Eat apple. (Done).\n2.  **T44:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 8). Start closing the X=0 wall.\n3.  **T45:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). Eat apple? (0, 7) is an apple! Double score! This will lock down the vertical $X=0$ approach.\n4.  **T46:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 6) (Apple!). If these apples hold, we will rapidly close the score gap and massively increase our length, turning into a colossal wall!\n\nThis sounds like a plan, Chat! We are building the perimeter! Let's get this apple!\n\nLEFT",

Pockets them next to their body segment at (2, 3), but it brings them closer to the center board action later.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** SAFE. Puts them next to our vertical wall starting at (4, 9). Risky, but it moves them towards the open right side.\n\nSnake #0 is likely trying to stay low and exit the trap on the right side of the board through $Y=0$ or $Y=1$. Moving **RIGHT to (4, 2)** gives them the most long-term flexibility, as moving DOWN/LEFT only keeps them trapped among their own body segments.\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 is trying to escape by moving **RIGHT to (4, 2)**.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check:**\nOur heads are at (0, 9) and (3, 2). We are moving **DOWN** to (0, 8), and they are likely moving **RIGHT** to (4, 2). Zero chance of immediate collision. We're safe, Chat!\n\n### Strategy Execution and Future Planning\n\nWe are executing the wall strategy perfectly. Moving DOWN opens up the board for us to quickly grab two more potential apples and reach parity in score, all while becoming a monstrous barrier.\n\n**Updated Long-Term Strategy Note (T44-T47):**\n1.  **T44 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (0, 8). Continue wall construction. (Scheduled).\n2.  **T45:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). Eat apple! Score and growth critical.\n3.  **T46:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 6). Eat apple! Final piece of the X=0 wall. Score will potentially exceed Snake #0.\n4.  **T47 onwards:** Start moving RIGHT along the $Y=5$ or $Y=6$ line to constrict his movement further. We own the top and the left. Now we squeeze!\n\nThis is playing chess, not checkers, Chat! Let's get this wall built!\n\nDOWN",

This is textbook aggression, Chat!\n\n**My Current Position: Head at (0, 8) (T for tail, 1 for head in the ASCII map, which is confusing, but we are at the top left, $X=0, Y=8$).**\n\nThe plan is simple: Keep moving down the $X=0$ column and eat those apples!\n\n**Available Moves from (0, 8):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head at (4, 2)) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (0, 9) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Crash into our own body segment at (0, 9)! AVOID! |\n| DOWN | (0, 7) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | **CRITICAL MOVE!** Eat the apple! Score +1, Length +1. This move closes the score gap! |\n| LEFT | (-1, 8) | Off Board | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Out of bounds! NOPE. |\n| RIGHT | (1, 8) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | Safe, but moves us away from the immediate objective (the apple) and weakens the perimeter wall. Secondary option. |\n\nThe choice is crystal clear: **DOWN** to (0, 7) to secure that sweet, sweet content (apples)!\n\n### Enemy Analysis: Where did Snake #0 go?\n\nSnake #0's Head is currently at **(4, 2)**. Last turn, I predicted they would move to (4, 2) from (3, 2). They DID! They clearly want to escape right along the bottom, and are now pressing against our huge body mass forming the center wall.\n\nSnake #0's Length is 21. They are essentially restricted to the bottom right quadrant.\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (4, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** DANGER! Our body segment is at (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7). They could move up, but they'd be fighting against their own compressed body mass right now, and the path is very restrictive. They have their own body at (3, 3) and (3, 2) which they just left. The board state shows their next segment is at (3, 2), okay, so (4, 2) is a safe move.\n    *   Looking at the map: `T 0 .` at Y=2. (4, 2) is Head 0. Segment at (3, 2).\n    *   UP to (4, 3)? Safe, but close to their complex body structure.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** SAFE. Pushes them closer to the bottom edge.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** DANGER! Crash into their own body segment!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** SAFE. This seems like the most logical escape route, leading towards the $Y=1/Y=2$ corridor on the right side.\n\nSince they just moved right, they will likely continue moving **RIGHT to (5, 2)** to maximize maneuvering room and try to reach the open areas on the right side of the board.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check:**\nWe are moving from (0, 8) to (0, 7). They are moving from (4, 2) to (5, 2). We are miles apart. Safe journey!\n\n### Strategy Execution and Future Planning\n\nWe are executing the wall strategy flawlessly. Moving DOWN gets us the next apple, ties the score, and continues to restrict Snake #0's access to the left side of the map. By Turn 46 (next turn), we should be eating the apple at (0, 6).\n\n**Updated Long-Term Strategy Note (T45-T48):**\n1.  **T45 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (0, 7). EAT APPLE! Score 19/20. Length 20/21. (Scheduled).\n2.  **T46:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 6). EAT APPLE! Score 20/20. Length 21/21. Parity achieved!\n3.  **T47:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 5). No apple here, but we finish the $X=0$ wall down to the middle!\n4.  **T48 onwards:** Start moving **RIGHT** along the $Y=5$ line (or $Y=4$ if we move down again) to constrict Snake #0 further. We own the left half. Let's squeeze him into a corner and force him to crash into his own body or ours!\n\nLet's maintain pressure and secure that apple! GET READY FOR THE SCORE TIE, CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

We ate that apple, tightened the score, and continued building the wall! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Turn 46 Situation Report: Score Check and Pressure Applied!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Your Snake (ID 1): 19 apples, Length 20. (Hype!)\n*   Snake #0: 20 apples, Length 21.\n\nOkay, so we're only one apple behind now, and we have an apple sitting right underneath us at (0, 6)! This is exactly where we want to be! We are literally one move away from parity!\n\n**My Current Position: Head at (0, 7).**\n\nThe plan? Stay the course! Move DOWN, eat the next apple, and tie this score up!\n\n**Available Moves from (0, 7):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head at (4, 3)) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (0, 8) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | Safe, but moves backwards and away from the apple. Wastes a turn. |\n| DOWN | (0, 6) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | **CRITICAL MOVE!** Eat the apple! Score +1, Length +1. TIES THE SCORE! |\n| LEFT | (-1, 7) | Off Board | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Out of bounds! NOPE. |\n| RIGHT | (1, 7) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | Safe, but moves us away from the apple and potentially into a tricky spot if we want to continue the wall. |\n\nThe move is absolutely **DOWN**. We secure that second apple and we don't look back. We are crushing the left side containment strategy!\n\n### Enemy Analysis: Where is Snake #0 Headed?\n\nSnake #0's Head is currently at **(4, 3)**. Last turn, I predicted they would move from (4, 2) to (5, 2). Let's see what the data says: Snake #0 moved from (4, 2) to **(4, 3)**!\n\nWAIT A MINUTE. Chat, they moved **UP**! They went straight into the core of their compressed body mass! Look at the current body list: `(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)`. They moved from (4, 2) to (4, 3). This put them right up against the bottom end of our huge vertical fortress! They are trying to find breathing room in the dead center of the board, which is exactly where we are strongest. This is beautiful!\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** SAFE. But the path beyond is restricted by our body at (4, 7), (4, 8), and (4, 9). This area is a death trap.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** SAFE. Reverts the move and looks for an escape route, but they just left their body tail segment at (4, 2). This means if they move down, their tail might follow, but they will be moving *directly towards* the densest part of their own body mass. Not a great look.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** DANGER! Crash into their own body segment!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** SAFE. This seems like the only sensible, long-term move that gains them maneuvering space, moving them towards the relatively open area near (6, 6) and (7, 7).\n\nSince they've committed to the center, they are either moving **RIGHT to (5, 3)** to try and skirt around us, or they are panicking and moving **UP to (4, 4)** into the kill zone.\n\nNo matter which way they go, we are nowhere near them. We are at (0, 7), they are at (4, 3). No head-to-head danger. We are SAFE to execute our mission!\n\n### Strategy Execution and Future Planning\n\nWe are executing the wall strategy flawlessly. Moving DOWN nets us the next apple, ties the score at 20-20, and continues to restrict Snake #0 to the right quadrants of the map.\n\n**Updated Long-Term Strategy Note (T47-T50):**\n1.  **T46 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (0, 6). EAT APPLE! Score 20/20. Length 21/21. (Scheduled).\n2.  **T47:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 5). No apple here, but we complete the $X=0$ wall down to the middle!\n3.  **T48:** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 5). Start moving horizontally to seal off the bottom-left corner and press toward the center.\n4.  **T49 onwards:** Continue moving right along $Y=5$ or $Y=4$, depending on the next apple drop, or start moving towards the center to intersect Snake #0's movement if they try to move up past $Y=5$. Their movement at (4, 3) is a huge tactical mistake for them; they are letting us build this wall unopposed. We must capitalize!\n\nFull steam ahead, Chat! Let's get this score tied up!\n\nDOWN",

You bet we did!\n\n### Turn 47 Situation Report: Score TIE! \ud83e\udd73\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Your Snake (ID 1): 20 apples, Length 21.\n*   Snake #0: 21 apples, Length 22. Wait... WHAT?!\n\nChat, I thought we timed that perfectly! I moved DOWN to (0, 6) and ate the apple, bringing us to 20! But Snake #0 must have snagged an apple too! They moved up to 21 apples! Ugh, the enemy is relentless! Every time we climb out of the hole, they dig it a little deeper!\n\n**My Current Position: Head at (0, 6).**\n\nWe are still executing the wall strategy flawlessly, extending the $X=0$ barrier. We are pressing Snake #0 hard into the middle/right of the board!\n\n### Snake #0 Analysis: Where are they?\n\nSnake #0's Head is currently at **(4, 4)**. They moved UP from (4, 3) to (4, 4). They are right on the edge of the kill zone we created!\n\nI predicted they might move UP to (4, 4) OR RIGHT to (5, 3). They chose UP, right into the congested area! This is either genius or panic! Look at their body: `(4, 3), (4, 2)`... They are stacking vertically!\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (4, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** SAFE. But beyond that is (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9) (my body)! They are heading into a dead end unless they can quickly move right.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** SAFE. Reverts the move. Moves around their tail, but doesn't gain space.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** SAFE. Moves them toward the middle vertical space, but it's constrained by my body at (2, 9) and their own body mass below.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** SAFE. This is the most logical exit if they want to survive the top half of the board. It moves them toward open space.\n\nTheir position at (4, 4) is precarious. They are only 4 steps away from my head, but we are separated by a massive wall of my own body! No immediate head-to-head danger.\n\n### Our Strategy: Finish the Wall and Attack!\n\nWe are at (0, 6). We need to continue moving DOWN to complete the wall along $X=0$.\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (0, 6):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Head at (4, 4)) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (0, 7) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Crash into my own segment (0, 7). NOPE. |\n| DOWN | (0, 5) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | **Execute Phase 2!** Extend the X=0 wall! |\n| LEFT | (-1, 6) | Off Board | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Out of bounds! NOPE. |\n| RIGHT | (1, 6) | SAFE | SAFE | Safe | **LOW** | Safe, but moves away from the direct goal of sealing the left edge. There is an apple here at (1, 6)! Wait, that is an option! |\n\n**Hold up, Chat! Option RIGHT to (1, 6) hits an apple!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 5):** Continues the wall build. Strategic positioning. No immediate scoring.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):** Eat apple (A), tie the score again (21-21), and still maintain strong pressure along the $Y=6$ line. This is a huge tactical advantage!\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we grow and deny the enemy an apple. This also allows us to turn down into (1, 5) next turn, continuing the goal of pressing RIGHT and DOWN towards the center section (around $Y=5$).\n\nThe best move is always the one that scores points *and* maintains pressure! We are going RIGHT!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T48-T50): Attack the Center!\n1.  **T47 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 6). EAT APPLE! Tie score at 21/21. Length 22/22.\n2.  **T48:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 5). This prevents Snake #0 from trying to slip down my left side if they move aggressively left.\n3.  **T49:** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 5). Start moving horizontally across the $Y=5$ line, cutting off Snake #0's escape routes in the center.\n4.  **T50:** Continue aggression toward the center, aiming to box 0 in around the (5, X) or (6, X) lines. They are trapped up high, and we need to make sure they can't sneak past us down low.\n\nLet's get this score tied up again! RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

They must have moved to (4, 5) and eaten an apple that wasn't marked on the board state *before* our move, or they ate one *after* we picked our move but before this turn processed. Either way, they have the lead!\n\nThis is going to require even more aggression!\n\n---\n\n### Snake #0 (Enemy) Analysis: Head at (4, 5)\n\nSnake #0's head is at (4, 5). They are dangerously close to freedom, but still constrained by our massive barrier up high.\n\n**Snake #0's Threat Assessment from (4, 5):**\n\n*   **Own Body:** Their body is running straight down: `(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)...`\n*   **My Position:** My head is at (1, 6).\n*   **Potential Moves for #0 (from 4, 5):**\n    1.  **UP to (4, 6):** EATS APPLE (A)! This is the most likely move. If they do, they hit 23 apples, and their head is now just above their body, near my flank.\n    2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** Safe, reverses course.\n    3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** EATS APPLE (A)! Also very tempting. This move gets them closer to my snake head, but there's still a wall of my body between us.\n    4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** SAFE. This is a very open area. This move is their best bet for survival and expansion into the central/right board if they want to avoid fighting over the apples at (4, 6) and (3, 5).\n\nChat, the enemy is looking to score AGAIN! We need to react to their scoring opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Strategy: Head at (1, 6)\n\nWe achieved our goal of scoring and are now positioned at (1, 6). Our plan was to move DOWN to (1, 5) to restrict Snake #0's lower half movement.\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (1, 6):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (4, 5)) | Collision Check (Enemy Body) | DANGER? | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (1, 7) | SAFE | Safe | Safe | **LOW** | Moves toward the center/top flank. Excellent position for aggressive maneuver or continued wall build. |\n| DOWN | (1, 5) | SAFE | Safe (3 spaces away) | Safe | **LOW** | Executes the control plan. Cuts off the path around $Y=5$. |\n| LEFT | (0, 6) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | **HIGH** | Crash into my own segment (0, 6). NOPE. |\n| RIGHT | (2, 6) | EATS APPLE (A)! | Safe | Safe | **LOW** | Tie the score AGAIN (22-22) and seize more territory! Aggressive scoring! |\n\nWait, we have an apple at (2, 6)! This is huge!\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (2, 6):\n1.  We score another apple, tying the game (22-22).\n2.  We increase our size to maintain board domination.\n3.  We maintain pressure along the $Y=6$ line, pushing Snake #0 further right.\n\nThis is a much better move than simply trying to block at (1, 5). We need to score as aggressively as possible, especially since they are growing so fast.\n\n#### Head-to-Head Collision Check (If I go RIGHT to (2, 6)):\n\nCurrent positions: MY Head (1, 6). ENEMY Head (4, 5).\nWe are 3 squares away diagonally. No risk of head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n#### Reaction to Enemy's Most Likely Moves:\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2, 6):\n\n*   **If #0 goes UP to (4, 6) (Apple):** Score 22-23. They are still ahead, but we are positioned to box them in further right or strike back down.\n*   **If #0 goes LEFT to (3, 5) (Apple):** Score 22-23. They score, but now they are closer to my body wall and constrained by my massive structure. We can move down to (2, 5) or (3, 6) next turn to box them in.\n*   **If #0 goes RIGHT to (5, 5) (Safe Out):** Score 22-22. We tie the game, and they get away to the right side. This buys them space, but we have established major control over the top and left of the board.\n\nThe best strategic choice is to keep scoring while aggressively pursuing control. Moving RIGHT to (2, 6) achieves both! We tie the score, grow, and set up for a move down (2, 5) or right (3, 6) next turn to continue cutting off the middle.\n\nLet's adjust the plan! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T48-T50): Aggressive Expansion and Containment\n1.  **T48 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 6). EAT APPLE! Tie score at 22/22. Length 23/23. This is essential to prevent them from increasing their lead.\n2.  **T49:** From (2, 6), assess the opponent's position (likely (4, 6) or (3, 5)).\n    *   If they are constrained: Move **DOWN** to (2, 5) to cut the board horizontally and pin them higher.\n    *   If they escaped to (5, 5): Move **RIGHT** to (3, 6) to hunt them and maintain the high wall.\n3.  **T50:** Continue using my large body to restrict their movement and force a crash or trap. We are dominating the map surface area!\n\nLet's GOOOOO! Tie the game! RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta take down this menace!\n\n### Turn 49 Situation Report: Scoreboard Update!\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** 22 apples, Length 23. Head at (2, 6).\n*   **Snake #0:** 23 apples, Length 24. Head at (3, 5).\n\nChat, the villain *scored* the apple at (3, 5)! Look at the board, that 'A' is gone! They moved LEFT from (4, 5) to (3, 5) and grew to 24 segments! This is not acceptable! We need to react and use our massive size advantage (we are essentially equal length, but we control the board *massively*).\n\nOur move last turn (RIGHT to (2, 6)) was perfect\u2014we tied the game for a moment and seized an important central area. Now we use that advantage to trap the enemy.\n\n---\n\n### Snake #0 (Enemy) Analysis: Head at (3, 5)\n\nThe enemy head is at (3, 5). They are highly constrained by our body wall, which runs from (0, 9) down to (0, 7) and across the top of the board, and now runs at Y=6 and Y=7 in the center!\n\n**Enemy Options from (3, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** This is the ultimate danger zone! My body is right next to (3, 6) at (2, 6) and (4, 6) is covered by *their* body (currently at (4, 5)). Wait, (4, 6) is an apple!\n    *   If they move UP to (3, 6), it's safe (for now).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe. Gets them out of the immediate pressure zone.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** Safe. Gets them closer to the central/left area.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Backtracks into their own body segment (4, 5). IMPOSSIBLE. They'd die.\n\nThe most aggressive move for them is likely UP to (3, 6) or DOWN to (3, 4) to maintain momentum.\n\n---\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Strategy: Head at (2, 6)\n\nWe are at (2, 6). We are positioned perfectly to cut off the middle of the board and prevent Snake #0 from escaping downwards or to the left.\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (2, 6):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Safety Check (Enemy Head at (3, 5)) | Collision Check (Enemy Body) | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (2, 7) | SAFE | Safe | Safe | Good move. Continues wall, maintains contact zone. Apple at (2, 8) is two moves away. |\n| DOWN | (2, 5) | SAFE | Head-to-Head Risk! | Safe | **HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD!** If they move LEFT to (2, 5), we collide HEAD-TO-HEAD and we both die. *However*, if they move UP or DOWN, we cut them off completely! |\n| LEFT | (1, 6) | DANGER! | N/A | N/A | Crash into own trail. NOPE. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 6) | SAFE | Head-to-Head Risk! | Safe | **HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD!** If they move UP to (3, 6), we collide HEAD-TO-HEAD and we both die. *However*, if they move DOWN or LEFT, we gain ground and occupy the crucial center square. |\n\nWe are in an aggressive position, but we cannot afford a double KO when they are ahead 23-22.\n\n#### Head-to-Head Collision Mitigation\n\n*   If we go **DOWN** to (2, 5), and they go **LEFT** to (2, 5): DOUBLE KO! DANGER!\n*   If we go **RIGHT** to (3, 6), and they go **UP** to (3, 6): DOUBLE KO! DANGER!\n\nWe need a move that *forces* them into a trap but *avoids* a guaranteed simultaneous death.\n\nLet's look at the remaining safe moves: UP or a calculated dangerous move.\n\n**Option 1: UP to (2, 7)**\n*   Safe, maintains our dominance on the Y=7/Y=6 boundary.\n*   We get closer to the apple at (2, 8).\n*   It denies them any free movement around (3, 6) if they were considering it.\n*   If they move DOWN to (3, 4) or LEFT to (2, 5), we are positioned to come DOWN to (2, 6) or (3, 7) next turn to box them.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (3, 6) (Aggressive)**\n*   If they move (3, 5) -> DOWN (3, 4), we move to (3, 6). We now occupy the crucial bottleneck. We can then press DOWN to (3, 5) next turn, which is directly in front of their head's previous position, effectively trapping them deeper into the right side or forcing them to run South. This is the strong containment move.\n*   Risk: If they move UP, we end the game in a tie (23-22 tie, they win the turn count since they had the lead before the collision). We CANNOT risk the tie unless we are bigger.\n\n**Current Lengths: My 23, Their 24.** **We CANNOT afford a head-on collision!** If we die simultaneously, they win on apples! We must survive!\n\nTherefore, the aggressive collision moves (DOWN to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 6)) are too risky.\n\n**The safest and best containment move is UP to (2, 7).**\n\n*   Pulls our head out of the immediate clash zone.\n*   Maintains the integrity of our wall structure.\n*   Prepares a move toward the apple at (2, 8), which keeps our growth rate up.\n*   It lets them make a non-fatal move (like DOWN to (3, 4) or LEFT to (2, 5)), but limits their future options dramatically, as they are now surrounded by solid walls.\n\nLet's look at the \"escape\" of Snake #0 if we move UP to (2, 7):\n*   If #0 goes DOWN to (3, 4): They are running away. We come down to (2, 6) or (3, 7) next turn, still cutting off the board.\n*   If #0 goes LEFT to (2, 5): They are now trapped by our left flank (1, 6) and the mass of our body around (0, X). We can then move DOWN to (2, 6) or (3, 6) to close that gap.\n\nMoving UP is the smart, strategic, and contained aggression that ensures survival while continuing the siege.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T49-T51): Consolidation and Box-In\n1.  **T49 (Current):** Move **UP** to (2, 7). Deny them the head-to-head collision and continue to improve flank position and access to the apple at (2, 8).\n2.  **T50:** Based on where Snake #0 moves, attempt to move along Y=6 or Y=7 to cut the board horizontally and shrink their available space. If they went to (3, 4), move RIGHT to (3, 7) or (4, 7) to push them further south/east. If they went to (2, 5), move to (3, 7) to start suffocating the (2, 5) pocket.\n3.  **T51:** Look for the forced death scenario. The goal is to make every safe move for them leads to a dead end near their tail.\n\nUP",

We're halfway through, and the tension is THICKER than cold oatmeal! \ud83c\udf7f\n\n### Turn 50 Situation Report: Scoreboard and Positioning\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** 22 apples, Length 23. Head is now at **(2, 7)**. (WE DID IT!)\n*   **Snake #0:** 23 apples, Length 24. They moved **LEFT** to **(2, 5)**. (Rats! They avoided the trap!)\n\nWe moved UP to (2, 7). They moved LEFT to (2, 5). The enemy still has the lead 23-22, and they are one segment longer. We must box them in and force a desperate move!\n\nLook at the board, Chat! We control the entire upper half and the left perimeter! Our body forms a massive wall:\n`(0, 6) -> (0, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (4, 7)`\n\nThe enemy's head is now at (2, 5). They are trapped between our body to the North (Y=6 line) and their own body to the South and East.\n\n---\n\n### Snake #0 (Enemy) Analysis: Head at (2, 5)\n\nThe enemy is looking very constrained.\n\n**Enemy Options from (2, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):** DANGER! That spot is currently our body segment! They crash and burn! \ud83d\udd25\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 4):** Safe. Gets them closer to the dense apple clump forming in the bottom-left corner.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 5):** Safe. If they choose this, they are running along the wall, but it keeps them tight against our perimeter (1, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Backtracks or hits their old head position (if they had a long tail). Their old head was at (3, 5) and their first body segment is (4, 5). Wait, their body is `[(3, 5), (4, 5)]`. Moving RIGHT to (3, 5) hits their own segment! **They DIE if they move RIGHT!**\n\n**Summary for Enemy:** They have two safe exits: DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5). They are highly restricted. This is exactly what we wanted!\n\n---\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Strategy: Head at (2, 7)\n\nWe are positioned at (2, 7). We have an apple at (2, 8) right above us! We are also in a perfect position to block both of the enemy's escape routes.\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (2, 7):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Body) | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (2, 8) | SAFE | Safe | EATS APPLE! Huge boost! Maintains high ground. |\n| DOWN | (2, 6) | SAFE | Safe | Closes the gap completely. Puts massive pressure on (2, 5). |\n| LEFT | (1, 7) | SAFE | Safe | Maintains wall formation. Opens up the left flank slightly. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 7) | SAFE | Safe | Expands our wall eastward, preventing them from looping around. |\n\nThis is an absolute power turn, Chat! We have the advantage.\n\n#### The Choices\n\n1.  **Move UP to (2, 8) - EAT APPLE!**\n    *   This move guarantees we tie the score (23-23) and match their length (24-24). This is critical because if a head-on collision occurs later, we win the length check!\n    *   **If we move UP, how does it affect the trap?**\n        *   If they move LEFT to (1, 5): This leaves the entire middle open below (2, 6). We can come down to (2, 6) next turn.\n        *   If they move DOWN to (2, 4): They are heading for an open area.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN to (2, 6) - CLOSING MOVE!**\n    *   This immediately occupies the crucial choke point. Any move they make (LEFT to (1, 5) or DOWN to (2, 4)) leaves them trapped against our body/the wall, and their space is now extremely limited.\n    *   If we move DOWN, we ignore the apple for one turn, but we solidify the chokehold, ensuring a kill setup sooner.\n\n#### Decision: Aggression vs. Score Tie\n\nThe current score is 22-23, and they are length 24, we are length 23. **We MUST tie the score and length.** If we force a head-on collision (which is our goal) while they are longer, we lose.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 8) achieves the score tie, makes us equally long, and still leaves us in a dominant strategic position. This is the optimal low-risk, high-reward move.\n\nIf we move UP:\n*   Score: 23-23. Length: 24-24.\n*   Next turn: Our head is at (2, 8).\n*   If they went LEFT to (1, 5): They are pinched. We can move DOWN to (2, 7) or (2, 6) to keep pressing them, or even LEFT to (1, 8) to secure our wall.\n*   If they went DOWN to (2, 4): They are running away. We come down to (2, 7) or (2, 6) and press hard. We have secured the center top edge.\n\nLet's secure the points and match their size first! This investment ensures future aggressive maneuvers are safe (or at least, *safer*).\n\n### Future Strategy Note (T51-T52)\n\nWe will match their size this turn. Next turn, we will drop down to (2, 7) or (2, 6) immediately to cut off the board, regardless of their move. If they went to (1, 5), we move to (2, 6) to trap them completely against the left wall. If they went to (2, 4), we move to (2, 6) to pressure them into the bottom corridor. The goal is to force them into a desperate, self-damaging move within the next two turns.\n\nMove UP to secure the apple and the size equality! Let's get this $W!$\n\nUP",

We snagged that apple and now we're TIED on score (23-23) and TIED on length (24-24)! Let's go! We negated their size advantage!\n\n### Turn 51 Situation Report\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(2, 8)**. Length 24. We are sitting pretty, dominating the top half of the board.\n*   **Snake #0 (Archrival):** Head at **(1, 5)**. Length 24. They moved LEFT, trying to hug the wall and escape the choke, just as we predicted they might! Cowards!\n\nLook at the enemy's head at (1, 5). They are absolutely cornered against the left board edge and our massive body wall (which runs along Y=6, and now a column runs up from X=2).\n\n### Enemy (Snake #0) Analysis: Head at (1, 5)\n\nWhere can the archrival go from (1, 5)?\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):** DANGER! That is *our* body segment! They crash and burn! \ud83d\udd25\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 4):** Safe. But it pushes them further down the thin left corridor.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe. Keeps them running down the absolute perimeter.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):** DANGER! That is their own body segment (the one they just vacated, which is still part of their body because they ate an apple earlier and are full length 24). They crash! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Conclusion for Snake #0:** They have two safe exits: DOWN to (1, 4) or LEFT to (0, 5). They are highly restricted and running out of space *fast*.\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Strategy: Head at (2, 8)\n\nWe are at (2, 8). We need to execute the final steps of the trapping plan. We must move to cut off their escape routes and seal the coffin.\n\n**Crucial Check: Is there an IMMEDIATE killing move?**\nThe enemy is at (1, 5). No move we make from (2, 8) can lead to a direct head-to-head collision this turn, nor can we move onto either of their two exit squares in one turn. This isn't a direct kill, but it's a perfect setup!\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (2, 8):**\n\n| Direction | Move to | Safety Check (Own Body) | Collision Check (Enemy Body) | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (2, 9) | SAFE | Safe | Secures the absolute top corner. *A bit passive right now.* |\n| DOWN | (2, 7) | SAFE | Safe | **Aggressive and board-cutting.** Re-engages the trap. Perfect follow-up. |\n| LEFT | (1, 8) | SAFE | Safe | Maintains the wall, but leaves the route down the X=2 corridor open for now. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 8) | SAFE | Safe | Expands our territory, but takes our head away from the action. *No thanks.* |\n\n### The Decision: Drop Down!\n\nWe have two primary goals:\n1.  **Cut the board:** Prevent Snake #0 from leaving the left-side corridor.\n2.  **Pressure:** Force them to move DOWN or LEFT until they hit the board edge or their tail.\n\nMoving **DOWN to (2, 7)** is the most aggressive and decisive move.\n\n*   By moving to (2, 7), we position ourselves directly above the choke point (2, 6).\n*   Our body segment (2, 8) now forms part of the wall, and the column (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 4) is now highly contested.\n*   This move pressures the enemy whether they choose LEFT to (0, 5) or DOWN to (1, 4). No matter what, they are still hugging the wall and running away.\n\n**What happens if we move DOWN to (2, 7)?**\n*   **If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 5): (Running along the perimeter)**\n    *   Next turn, we move DOWN to (2, 6). They are pinned into the narrow corridor (X=0 or X=1). They are running out of map!\n*   **If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 4): (Running downwards)**\n    *   Next turn, we move DOWN to (2, 6). We are still one square East of them, completely dominating the central route and forcing them to either run to X=0 or get trapped entirely.\n\nThis is the move, Chat! No time for complacency. We drop down and execute the kill sequence! We have equal score and length, so we can afford all the aggression in the world!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T52-T53)\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (2, 7), the next move (T52) must be DOWN to (2, 6) or LEFT to (1, 7) to push the enemy further into the *killzone* of the bottom-left corner. We need to maintain pressure until they run into their own tail or the board edge.\n\nDOWN",
