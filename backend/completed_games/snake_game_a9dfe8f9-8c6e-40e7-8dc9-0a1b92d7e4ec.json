We check all directions:\n\n*   **UP (to (5,5)):** Empty cell. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **DOWN (to (5,3)):** Empty cell. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to (4,4)):** Empty cell. \u2705 Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to (6,4)):** Empty cell. \u2705 Safe.\n\nOKAY, all moves are safe right now. That's a blessing and a curse, chat! Too many choices! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nNow, STRATEGY TIME. The enemy is way over on the right edge. We need to think long-term. We want to DOMINATE the board and BOX HIM IN. He's stuck in the corner, right? That's a WEAKNESS we can exploit! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nBut we also need to GROW. Look at those apples! There's one super close at (4,2) and another at (5,2). But moving DOWN towards them might pull us away from the enemy. OR DOES IT? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**THE PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:** We need to start controlling the center of the board. Moving LEFT to (4,4) gets us closer to the center and also sets us up to swoop down and grab that cluster of apples at (4,2) and (5,2) next. It keeps options open - from there we can go UP, DOWN, or further LEFT. If we go RIGHT towards the enemy now, we're thin and he has room to maneuver. Let's get BIG first, then hunt.\n\nSo the play is to consolidate our position, get some early apples, and then march over to trap Snake #1 against the wall. LET'S GET THIS BREAD!\n\nLEFT",

We're LIVE and I'm HYPED to crush this noob snake #0 right outta the gate! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d Look at that board \u2013 wide open for domination, and that fool's chillin' at (5,4) like he owns the place. But nah, we're comin' for his head! Scores tied at 0, but not for long \u2013 time to grow fat and box him into oblivion. Who's ready to see me feast? LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!\n\nFirst off, reviewin' the scene: I'm posted up at (9,1), solo head, no body to worry about yet. Enemy's a tiny worm at (5,4). Board? Apples EVERYWHERE, but we're not chasin' 'em blind \u2013 we're plottin' to trap this dude while snaggin' growth. Can't go RIGHT, that's off the edge \u2013 instant L, no cap. \ud83d\udeab DOWN to (9,0)? Safe, empty, leads toward that apple at (7,0) in 3 moves. UP to (9,2)? Also safe, empty, heads up the right side toward (9,6) apple later. But LEFT to (8,1)? Oh yeah, that's the play \u2013 empty cell, straight shot along row 1 to gobble that juicy apple at (4,1) in 5 moves flat. Keeps me movin' toward the center, closin' on the enemy without gettin' stuck. Why risk UP or DOWN when LEFT opens the board AND sets up an easy grow? Enemy might squirm, but with simultaneous moves, I'm forcin' him to react to ME. Aggressive? You know it! \ud83d\udca5\n\nAny head-on crash risk? Nah, he's too far left-up \u2013 my LEFT doesn't collide unless he teleports. Keepin' options wide: after this, I can pivot up/down easy. No tight spots, just pure board control. Chat, we eatin' first, then we hunt! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLong-term plan: Snake left along row 1 to (4,1) apple for quick +1 grow, stay alert for enemy moves toward center. Once bigger, circle up to cut off his paths and force a crash \u2013 dominate the mid-board!\n\nLEFT",

We're back in the arena, turn 1 droppin' like a bomb \u2013 scores locked at 0-0, but I'm 'bout to feast and flex on this snake #0 sittin' pretty at (4,4) like he ain't got a target on his back! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d Board wide open, apples scattered like free loot, but we ain't chasin' \u2013 we're huntin' HIS territory while stackin' segments to box him out. Remember that clutch LEFT last move? Slid from (9,1) to (8,1) smooth, no cap. Now, let's dissect this and scheme the W!\n\nCurrent vibe: My head chillin' at (8,1), no body drama yet \u2013 pure freedom. Enemy's solo at (4,4). All four directions? Let's break 'em:\n\n- RIGHT to (9,1): Safe, empty edge spot, but yo, that's runnin' AWAY from the action toward the wall. Why backpedal when we can close the gap? \ud83d\udeab Nah, pass \u2013 limits my flex later.\n\n- UP to (8,2): Empty cell, heads north along the right flank. Opens paths to apples like (8,6) or (8,7), and kinda angles toward enemy up-left. Solid safety, multiple escapes after, but doesn't pressure him direct. Could snake up then left to intercept \u2013 tempting!\n\n- DOWN to (8,0): Empty, bottom row toward (7,0) apple in one more left. Safe, but edges me near the south wall early. Good for quick grow, but feels too passive when I could slide center. Still, keeps options if he dives low.\n\n- LEFT to (7,1): Empty row 1 cell, straight path to that fat (4,1) apple in THREE moves now (was five before). Zero self-risk, no enemy body block, and simultaneous moves mean no head-on crash \u2013 his plays from (4,4) can't touch (7,1). This cuts me toward the center, eyes on his position, and grows me FAST to dominate space. Aggressive? Hell yeah \u2013 forces him to watch his left flank while I balloon!\n\nEliminatin' RIGHT 'cause it's retreat city \u2013 we don't run, we chase! Among UP, DOWN, LEFT: All safe, no deaths. But LEFT maxes apple proximity (grow ASAP for board control) AND keeps follow-ups wide \u2013 after, I can UP to (7,2) or pivot. UP's cool for vertical pressure, but LEFT traps him psychologically, closin' the x-distance from 4 units to 3. DOWN's too south for now. We're even scores, so grow > evade, and no collision traps since he's far. If he LEFTs or DOWNs, I gain ground; if he RIGHT/UPs, I still feast worry-free. Chat, we eatin' and settin' traps \u2013 who's hyped for the box-in? \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc80\n\nLong-term plan: Keep LEFT to snag (4,1) apple next-next turn for +1 grow, then UP toward row 4-5 to cut off his center escapes. Watch his moves \u2013 if he drifts left, circle behind; stay aggressive, force collision once I'm longer. Dominate mid-board in 5 turns!\n\nLEFT",

NO HEAD-ON COLLISION PLAY YET.\n\nLet's check the SAFE MOVES. Our body is nonexistent, so no worries about hitting ourselves! But we gotta check the opponent's potential moves.\n\n*   **UP (to 4,5):** Empty. \u2705\n*   **DOWN (to 4,3):** Empty. \u2705\n*   **LEFT (to 3,4):** Empty. \u2705\n*   **RIGHT (to 5,4):** Empty. \u2705\n\nALL DIRECTIONS ARE SAFE! But we can't just pick randomly, chat! We gotta be TACTICAL.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** The enemy is in the bottom-right corner. We are near the center-left. We need to CUT THE BOARD IN HALF. If we move RIGHT, we're going straight at him, but we're skinny. He has room to run. We need to GROW and CONTROL SPACE. Look at that beautiful cluster of apples at (4,2) and (5,2) DOWN and to our RIGHT. That's our first POWER-UP!\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,3) puts us ONE move away from that double-apple feast AND keeps us central. From there, we can grab one, then the other, and suddenly we're longer and more dangerous. If we go LEFT or UP, we're moving AWAY from the easiest growth opportunity. RIGHT is okay, but it's a bit of a commit towards the enemy without any size advantage.\n\n**THE PLAN:** Let's secure that bread! We go DOWN this turn, then next turn we snag an apple, getting bigger and putting pressure on the enemy by controlling more territory. We stay agile and avoid getting pinned early.\n\nDOWN",

We have NO body to worry about! That means we have maximum freedom, but we gotta be SMART with it.\n\nLet's ELIMINATE the deathtraps! \ud83d\udeab\u26b0\ufe0f\n*   **UP (to 4,4):** Empty space. SAFE. \u2705\n*   **DOWN (to 4,2):** Oh SNAP! That's an APPLE at (4,2)! We'd eat it and GROW! But is it SAFE? Our head moves there, and we don't have a body to crash into. IT'S SAFE! \u2705\n*   **LEFT (to 3,3):** There's an APPLE at (3,3)! Again, totally SAFE to move there and eat. \u2705\n*   **RIGHT (to 5,3):** Empty space. SAFE. \u2705\n\nALL DIRECTIONS ARE SAFE. BUT WE AIN'T PLAYING CHECKERS, CHAT, WE'RE PLAYING 4D CHESS! We gotta think about the OPPONENT. Snake #1 is at (7,1).\n\n**What's the enemy thinking?** \ud83e\udd14 His safe moves are UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0) which is an apple, LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1). He's probably gonna go for that easy apple DOWN at (7,0)! That would grow him and keep him in his corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We need to cut him OFF! He's in the bottom-right. We need to CONTROL THE CENTER and build a WALL with our body. We both have 0 apples, so a head-on collision is a DOUBLE KO. We avoid that for now. We need to GET BIGGER FIRST.\n\nLook at those apples! We have a juicy cluster to our LEFT and DOWN. If we go DOWN to (4,2) and eat, we grow. Next turn, we can easily go LEFT to (3,2) or RIGHT to (5,2) which is ANOTHER APPLE! That's a fast double-growth opportunity! Going LEFT to (3,3) is also good, but it doesn't set up a second apple as cleanly.\n\nTHE PLAN: Let's get that first apple FAST and start DOMINATING the board. We go DOWN, secure the growth, and position ourselves to snag another apple next turn, putting us AHEAD in the arms race. Then we can start pressuring that snake #1! CHAT, ARE YOU WITH ME?!\n\nDOWN",

Turn 2 hittin' hard, scores still 0-0, but your boy's snake locked and loaded at (7,1), ready to slither into dominance mode! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d Enemy chillin' at (4,3) like he owns the joint, but nah \u2013 we're 'boutta shrink his world, box that fool in, and make him taste the wall or our future gains. Last LEFT was chef's kiss, closin' that x-gap smooth \u2013 now we dissect, plot the crush, and keep the pressure ON. No apple chasin', fam; we're enemy-focused, growin' ONLY to own the board and force his crash. Who's feelin' the W vibes? \ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick board scan for threats: Wide open, no bodies blockin', enemy solo at (4,3). My (7,1) got all paths clear \u2013 no self-hits, no walls creepin'. Enemy's next spot? He could slide left (3,3), right (5,3), up (4,4), or down (4,2) \u2013 all simultaneous, so no head-on this round (our targets don't overlap, whew). But we stay ruthless: plot to cut his space, predict his drifts, and balloon later to trap. Current gap: 3 x-units right of him, 2 y-units below \u2013 time to close and circle like a predator!\n\nBreakin' down the four directions, eliminatin' the trash:\n\n- RIGHT to (8,1): Empty, sure, but that's BACKPEDALIN' east, widenin' the x-gap to 4 units? Hell naw \u2013 we're chasin', not fleein'! Hands-off this retreat snake move. \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 Why give him breathin' room when we can squeeze?\n\n- DOWN to (7,0): Empty? Wait, apple there, so grow pop \u2013 length 2 instant edge! Safe now, no crash. But yo, it bumps y-gap to 3 units south, pushin' me farther from his (4,3) zone. Too passive for dominatin'; edges me bottom-wall adjacent, limits future flex if he dives low. Grow's dope as a means, but not if it drifts us away from boxin' his ass. Pass \u2013 we need aggression, not side quests! \ud83d\udc0c\n\n- LEFT to (6,1): Empty cell, zero risks. Shrinks x-gap to 2 units (from 7 to 6, closin' on his 4 like a vice). Keeps me at y=1 for low-flank control, angles easy pivots to intercept if he drops down or lefts. Future moves? Wide open: up north toward his level, down south if needed, further left to hem him, or right peel-off. Perfect for settin' traps without committin' hard. Aggressive AF \u2013 forces him to eye his left side while we encroach! \ud83d\udca5\n\n- UP to (7,2): Empty too, no deaths. Cuts y-gap to 1 unit (from 1 to 2, matchin' his 3 closer). Stays x=7 for now, but opens vertical push to row 3-4, cuttin' center escapes. Follow-ups solid: left toward him, up higher, down reset, right flank. Strong pressure, keeps board control poppin'.\n\nAll safe, no throws \u2013 but we cut the weak: RIGHT and DOWN out 'cause they DON'T close the enemy gap (DOWN grows but sends us south, missin' the hunt; RIGHT's straight cowardice). Now, UP vs. LEFT? Both shrink total distance to 4 units, both keep 4 future paths open (no edge traps yet), both position for grow-by-default when we dominate space. But LEFT edges it ruthless: direct x-closure mimics last move's momentum, stays low to guard that (4,1) zone he might snake toward (if he downs twice, we can collide or block post-grow). UP's vertical flex is fire for center cut-off, but LEFT psychologically boxes his left/west expansion \u2013 if he rights to (5,3), we're closer to loop behind; if he lefts/down, we pincer faster. Scores tied, so no force-collide yet, but this sets the trap: grow soon via proximity control, then longer us = his nightmare. Chat, we shrinkin' his playground turn by turn \u2013 you see the box formin'? \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term scheme to my future self: Stick LEFT momentum 1-2 more turns to x=5 or 4 at y=1, closin' horizontal trap while watchin' his drift (if he ups/rights, pivot UP next to shadow from east; if lefts/downs, circle south-west for block). Grow opportunistic (snag nearby if it aids space grab, like low apples post-close), aim length 3+ by turn 5 to force paths narrow. No mercy \u2013 predict his safe spots, cut 'em off, collide once we're ahead. Dominate mid-left board, watch for his apple grabs to counter-grow!\n\nLEFT",

He thinks that apple bump gave him edge? Nah, fam \u2013 we're the predator closin' the noose, boxin' his world tighter than a bad tattoo. Last LEFT was pure fire, shrinkin' that x-gap like we own it; now we double down, predict his squirms, and carve his escape routes. No apple distractions \u2013 we're growin' to dominate, force his crash, and flip this script. You feelin' the heat buildin'? Who's ridin' for the comeback KO? \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick threat scan: Board wide open, no self-collisions possible (body-less beast mode), no wall hugs killin' us. Enemy's vertical stack at col4 rows 2-3 leaves him flexin' left to (3,2) empty, right to (5,2) apple snack, up to (4,3) tail-shift safe (he slinks, tail follows to old head spot), down to (4,1) apple grab. All his plays green for now, but we ain't lettin' him breathe \u2013 our moves gotta encroach, cut his west/east drifts, and set traps for that length-2 wiggle. Gaps: x=2 right of him, y=1 below \u2013 total manhattan 3; we slash it ruthless, keep 4+ follow-ups open, no dead-ends for us. Head-on risk? Zero overlap on our targets vs. his possibles \u2013 he can't reach (5,1), (6,2), etc. in one slide.

Hell no \u2013 we're chasin' dominance, not playin' tag-away! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude24 Why feed his freedom when we can starve it?\n\n- DOWN to (6,0): Empty cell, no instant death, y-drop to 0 keeps low control. But it jacks y-gap to 2 south, pushin' us bottom-edge adjacent and farther from his row2-3 zone \u2013 too passive, limits north pivots if he ups or rights. Grow potential low here; we'd drift instead of dictate. Pass \u2013 aggression over aimless slink! \ud83d\udc0d\u274c\n\n- LEFT to (5,1): Crystal clear, zero risks. Snaps x-gap to 1 (6\u21925, vice on his 4), holds y=1 for south-flank lockdown \u2013 perfect to shadow if he downs to (4,1) apple or lefts west. Follow-ups pop: up to (5,2) near his right-play, left to (4,1) intercept, down edge guard, right peel. Shrinks distance to 2 total, psychologically hems his left escape \u2013 if he rights, we loop faster; if he drops, we pincer post-grow. Momentum king from last LEFT \u2013 this boxes his core! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd12\n\n- UP to (6,2): Empty too, safe slide. Trims y-gap to 0 (1\u21922, levelin' his row2), x holds 6 for east pressure. Opens vertical cuts: left to (5,2) his apple/right spot, up to (6,3) center claim, down reset, right flank. Distance to 2, solid for mid-board ownage. But yo, it skips the x-closure grind \u2013 less direct hem than LEFT, leaves his west more open if he lefts.\n\nAll safe, no suicides \u2013 but RIGHT/DOWN axed for gap-widenin' trash (DOWN's low commit drifts us off-pace). UP vs. LEFT? Both cut dist to 2, both keep 4 paths flex (no traps yet), both prime for incidental grows via space grab. But LEFT wins ruthless: continues the x-squeeze momentum, guards low threats like his down apple rush, sets us at (5,1) to collide or block next if he don't dip. UP's north push is clean for center lockdown, but LEFT forces his hand west/south sooner \u2013 scores me behind (0-1), so no collide gamble yet, but this proximity play lets us grow opportunistic and balloon to trapper status. Chat, we shrinkin' his box one coil at a time \u2013 you see him sweatin'? \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term scheme to future me: Keep LEFT hammer next turn to (4,1) zone (snag that apple if clear for grow edge), then pivot based on his drift \u2013 if he rights/ups, shadow UP/LEFT to cut east/north; if lefts/downs, circle south-west for full hem. Grow via proximity (low apples like (4,1) or (5,2) if they aid trap), target length 2-3 by turn 5 to narrow his paths. Predict his safe cells, block 'em cold, force crash or our lead-flip collide. Own left-mid board, counter his apple hunts with blocks \u2013 no mercy, box complete!\n\nLEFT",

If we collide, HE DIES AND WE WIN! \ud83d\ude08 THIS IS A WINNING MOVE! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 2):** That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab CRASH! ABSOLUTELY NOT. DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 2):** Empty space! SAFE! \u2705\n\nOKAY CHAT! We have THREE viable moves. UP, DOWN (THE KILLING BLOW), and RIGHT.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWE ARE THE PREDATOR! \ud83d\udc0d Snake #1 is cornered in the bottom-right! He's at (5,1). Let's look at HIS moves:\n*   He can go UP to (5,2)... but that's OUR HEAD! That's a head-on collision where WE WIN! \ud83d\ude02\n*   He can go DOWN to (5,0)... which is an apple.\n*   He can go LEFT to (4,1)... which is an apple.\n*   He can go RIGHT to (6,1)... empty space.\n\nHe might try to run away DOWN or LEFT to eat an apple and grow. But if we go DOWN, we intercept him! We don't just win if we collide; we also BLOCK him from those apples! If we go RIGHT or UP, we give him a chance to survive and grow. WHY LET HIM BREATHE? \ud83d\udc4a\n\nTHE MOVE IS CLEAR! WE GO FOR THE THROAT! WE END THIS! PRESS THE ADVANTAGE! A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH A LENGTH ADVANTAGE IS AN INSTANT WIN! THIS IS THE META! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN (IF SOMEHOW WE BOTH LIVE):**\nIf we don't collide (maybe he runs RIGHT), our head will be at (5,1) and our body will be at (5,2), (4,2). We'll be in an even better position to corner him against the wall. We continue the pressure!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Turn 4 hittin' like a venom strike \u2013 we're at 0 apples, that smug snake #0 sittin' pretty with 2, his slimy length stretchin' from head (5,2) through (4,2) to tail (4,3), thinkin' he owns the mid-board. But nah, fam, our ghost snake at (5,1) is primed to coil tighter, no body draggin' us down yet \u2013 pure speed demon mode! Last LEFT was chef's kiss, slidin' us from (6,1) to shadow his right flank; now we amp the pressure, grow smart, and start sealin' his coffin. Enemy can't LEFT (suicide into his own neck at (4,2)), so his plays? UP to (5,3) empty climb, DOWN to (5,1) our old spot chasin' ghosts, or RIGHT to (6,2) empty drift. We predict, we pounce \u2013 force his crash or starve his space! Scores say grow first, no hero-ball collide yet, but one wrong wiggle from him and it's wrap-up time. You hyped for the trap snap? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc80\n\nThreat scan, keepin' it 100: Board still wide, our no-body flex means zero self-smash risks \u2013 all dirs green on walls/our nothing. Enemy's L-hook leaves his down empty but risky for him (our bait), his up/right open but we gon' hem that east/west. No head-on traps for us no matter his pick \u2013 our targets dodge his possibles clean. Apples? LEFT snags (4,1) gold, DOWN grabs (5,0) too, but we prioritize boxin' over bottom-huggin'. Gaps: He's col4-5 row2-3, we're col5 row1 \u2013 manhattan 1 north, perfect for south-flank lockdown. We slash closer ruthless, keep 3+ follow-ups poppin', no edge commits that box US in!\n\nDir breakdown, roastin' the scrubs:\n\n- RIGHT to (6,1): Empty slide, safe af, but yo, that's east bail-out, widenin' x-gap to 2+ while he chills mid? Soft retreat vibes, givin' him breathe room we can't afford \u2013 we're hunters, not hiders! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude24 Feeds his right drift, trash for dominance.\n\n- DOWN to (5,0): Apple feast, grow to 1, y-lock bottom edge. Safe now, but traps us next \u2013 from there, up hits own new body at (5,1), down walls out, only left/right escapes. Too pinned, drifts us south while he owns center; aggression demands center control, not corner naps! Pass, chat \u2013 edge play's for losers. \ud83d\udc0d\u274c\n\n- UP to (5,2): Vacates his old head spot, clean no-risk shift to row2 level, x-gap holds 1. Opens north cuts, but skips the side-squeeze \u2013 leaves his left more free if he ups, less hem than strikin' adjacent. Solid grow path? Nah, no apple here, just position. Meh for now, we need that point edge ASAP.\n\n- LEFT to (4,1): BOOM, apple chomp, grow length 2 body at (5,1), score 1-2 flip closer! Zero risks, snaps to his body column (col4 row1), total dist 1 \u2013 perfect south pincer on his hook. If he DOWNs to (5,1), he slams our new body? HIS funeral, chat \u2013 rules say he dies crashin' into us! Follow-ups fire: next left (3,1) open west block, down (4,0) empty guard, up (4,2) his old neck (blocks if he don't shift it clean). Shrinks his west escape, shadows his apple hunts, sets collide bait post-grow. Momentum from last LEFT? Doubled down, box tightens! This the ruthless coil \u2013 he sweats yet? \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd12\n\nAll safe, but RIGHT/UP/DOWN cut for gap-bloat, no-grow, or trap-risk \u2013 LEFT reigns: eats, grows, encroaches col4 to starve his left/down wiggles, forces him UP/RIGHT into our future loops. Grow to dominate, yeah? If he DOWNs, free win; if UP, we shadow north next; RIGHT, we cut east. No mercy!\n\nLong-term scheme to future me: Hammer LEFT momentum to claim col3-4 low, grow via nearby apples like (3,3) or (4,0) if clear \u2013 target length 3-4 by turn 7 to wall his mid. Predict his UP/RIGHT drifts, counter with LEFT/UP to cut north/east; if DOWN suicide, celebrate W. Block his body shifts cold, force wall/body crash or head-on when we lead 3+. Own left-center, circle south-west trap, no apple chases unless trap-aid. Predict safes, occupy 'em \u2013 box seal turn 8-10, KO incoming! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",
