Looking at the board, Snake #1 may have moved closer to the apple at (2,1), risking a head-on collision if I move towards (2,1). I will continue going toward the apple at (2,6) to maintain a safe distance from Snake #1. Once I've consumed the apple at (2,6), my next target will be the apple at (0,7) as earlier planned.\n\nStrategy: The biggest responsibility right now is to avoid Snake #1 and stay on course for the apple at (2,6). After taking that apple, depending on Snake #1's position, I will aim to get the apple at (0,7). Let's continue to move UP for now.\n\nNext move: UP"
