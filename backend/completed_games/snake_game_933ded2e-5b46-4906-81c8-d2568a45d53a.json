But from the map, (1,7) is near hazard 'T' at (0,7) and snake body parts at (2,7) (enemy snake). So, might be risky. But the cell (1,7) itself is '.', so safe for now.\n\n- DOWN to (1,5): Looking at your body, is (1,5) free? The map at (1,5) is '.', no mention of hazard or snake body. This could be safe.\n\n- LEFT to (0,6): Is your own body? No, you've been there previously but now your head is at (1,6), so going back is technically allowed if it doesn't collide with your own body. But is (0,6) your body? You ate an apple at (0,6) on last move. The body now includes (0,6). So moving back to (0,6) would be moving onto your own body segment, which is invalid.\n\n- RIGHT to (2,6): It's '.', no hazard, no snake. However, (2,6) is close to the enemy snake's positions at (2,7) and (2,8), so be cautious with that direction.\n\nSummary of possible moves:\n\n- UP (1,7): Safe, but close to enemy snake's body below. Might be vulnerable in the next move if they come down or around.\n\n- DOWN (1,5): Safe, empty space. Might not be moving toward apples directly, but potentially safer.\n\n- RIGHT (2,6): Approaching apples (6,6) and (8,6), but may be risky due to proximity to enemy snake.\n\n- LEFT (0,6): Not allowed, own body.\n\nStrategy:\n\nSince the goal is to reach apples at (6,6) and (8,6), moving RIGHT is the natural path, but risky now due to enemy snake proximity.\n\nMoving UP or DOWN is safer for now.\n\nIs it worth to go UP to (1,7) and potentially approach the apple at (2,9) later? Possibly, as (2,9) is an apple location up high.\n\nOption of DOWN to (1,5) might be safe, but leaves me further from immediate apples.\n\nGiven that, I think moving UP to (1,7) to eventually curve around and get to (2,9) or apples on the edge might be a good plan.\n\nNext turn, I can re-assess positions and possibly approach the apple at (2,9) or move right towards (6,6).\n\nDecided move: UP"
