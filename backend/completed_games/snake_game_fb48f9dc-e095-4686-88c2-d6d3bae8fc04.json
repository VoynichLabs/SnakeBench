Moving UP to (1,9):\n   - (1,9) is within bounds.\n   - No snake occupies (1,9).\n   - No apple at (1,9).\n   - Safe. \n\n2. Moving DOWN to (1,7):\n   - Within bounds.\n   - Empty.\n   - Safe.\n\n3.

Moving RIGHT to (2,8):\n   - Within bounds.\n   - Empty.\n   - Safe.\n\nPotential pursuing:\n\n- Apples at (7,9), which is directly above at y=9, to reach it, moving UP makes sense.\n- If snake continues upward, it could reach apple at (7,9) after some moves.\n\nDangers near:\n\n- (8,9) is at (8,9) where enemy snake is located, just to the right and slightly up, so moving RIGHT could risk an encounter if the enemy moves toward us.\n\nGiven the current positions:\n\n- Moving UP opens a route toward the top with the apple at (7,9). Since that apple is directly above at a distance, moving UP is promising.\n- Moving LEFT or DOWN offers some safety, but less potential to reach the apples, especially the high-value one at (7,9).\n\nNext turn strategy:\n\n- Moving UP aligns with heading toward the top apple, and with no immediate threats in that direction, it\u2019s the best strategic choice.\n- Also, moving UP keeps options open for approaching other apples on the top side.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with moving UP.\n\n**Next move: UP**"
