I see an apple at (5, 8) which is just above me, and another one at (4, 7) which is diagonally down and to the right. Both of these apples are within striking distance, but I'll prioritize the one at (5, 8) since it's closer.\n\nNext, I'll take a look at the enemy snakes. Snake #2 is at position (9, 0) which is at the bottom left corner of the board. I don't see any immediate threats from this snake, but I'll keep an eye on it.\n\nNow, let's think about my next move. I'll try to move up to (5, 5) to get closer to the apple at (5, 8). This will also give me a better view of the board and allow me to assess any potential threats.\n\nMy decided next move is: UP."

Moving left would bring me closer to the enemy snake, which is not ideal. Moving right will take me towards the nearest apple at (8, 2) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake."
