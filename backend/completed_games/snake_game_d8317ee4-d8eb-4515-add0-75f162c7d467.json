            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake. The head is at (9,6), and there are no bodies yet. The apples are at (1,3), (4,6), (2,7), (7,0), (0,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (4,3).\n\nFirst, I should check where I can move without dying. My current position is (9,6). The board is 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9). So, possible moves from the head:\n\n- Up would be increasing y. (9,6) up is (9,7).\n- Down is decreasing y: (9,5).\n- Left is decreasing x: (8,6).\n- Right is increasing x, but x is already at 9, so right is invalid (off the board). So right is out.\n\nNow check if any of the adjacent positions have the enemy snake. Enemy is at (4,3), which isn't adjacent to me. So no collision risk with enemy in the immediate moves. Since my body is none, moving into previous positions isn't a problem.\n\nSo possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking for apples nearby. Let's see: the apple at (4,6) is on the same y-coordinate as my head (6). Since my x is 9, and that apple is at x=4, y=6. So moving left would take me towards that apple. If I move left to (8,6), next move left again could approach that apple. Alternatively, moving down might take me away from that apple, maybe towards others?\n\nWait, my head is at (9,6). So the apple at (4,6) is directly to the left (since x is lower). Also, there's an apple at (2,7), which is left and up a bit. If I move up to (9,7), then left would take me to (8,7), which is closer to the apple at (2,7). \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (9,5), which doesn't seem to be near any apples immediately. The apple at (7,0) is way below, but that's a long way down and left.\n\nSo maybe moving left first is better because it's closer to apples. But wait, if I move left to (8,6), then next move left again, towards (7,6), etc., I could reach the apple at (4,6). That's a direct path. Plus, getting that apple would give me points and grow my body.\n\nLet me check if moving left from (9,6) is safe. The new position would be (8,6). There's no snake there. Enemy is at (4,3), which is not in that path. So yes, moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,7) \u2013 that's also safe. Then perhaps up again to (9,8), but then there's an apple at (2,7) which is to the left. But reaching that would take more moves.\n\nThe apple at (4,6) is directly left. So moving left is a straightforward path. I could also check if there's a chance of another snake blocking me. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not in my path for that apple. Unless the enemy moves into the path, but that's next turns.\n\nSo first move should be LEFT. Then continue left towards the apple at (4,6). Since moving left is safe and takes me towards an apple. Also, since I'm at x=9, moving left is valid. \n\nAnother consideration: apples at (2,7) and (1,3) are further away, but maybe I can get them after. The apple at (4,6) is closer. So this seems like the most efficient move.\n</think>\n\nI will move left to approach the apple at (4,6) on my y-coordinate. This is a direct path with no immediate obstacles. \n\nNext move: LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake. The head is at (9,6), and there are no bodies yet. The apples are at (1,3), (4,6), (2,7), (7,0), (0,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (4,3).\n\nFirst, I should check where I can move without dying. My current position is (9,6). The board is 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9). So, possible moves from the head:\n\n- Up would be increasing y. (9,6) up is (9,7).\n- Down is decreasing y: (9,5).\n- Left is decreasing x: (8,6).\n- Right is increasing x, but x is already at 9, so right is invalid (off the board). So right is out.\n\nNow check if any of the adjacent positions have the enemy snake. Enemy is at (4,3), which isn't adjacent to me. So no collision risk with enemy in the immediate moves. Since my body is none, moving into previous positions isn't a problem.\n\nSo possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking for apples nearby. Let's see: the apple at (4,6) is on the same y-coordinate as my head (6). Since my x is 9, and that apple is at x=4, y=6. So moving left would take me towards that apple. If I move left to (8,6), next move left again could approach that apple. Alternatively, moving down might take me away from that apple, maybe towards others?\n\nWait, my head is at (9,6). So the apple at (4,6) is directly to the left (since x is lower). Also, there's an apple at (2,7), which is left and up a bit. If I move up to (9,7), then left would take me to (8,7), which is closer to the apple at (2,7). \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (9,5), which doesn't seem to be near any apples immediately. The apple at (7,0) is way below, but that's a long way down and left.\n\nSo maybe moving left first is better because it's closer to apples. But wait, if I move left to (8,6), then next move left again, towards (7,6), etc., I could reach the apple at (4,6). That's a direct path. Plus, getting that apple would give me points and grow my body.\n\nLet me check if moving left from (9,6) is safe. The new position would be (8,6). There's no snake there. Enemy is at (4,3), which is not in that path. So yes, moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,7) \u2013 that's also safe. Then perhaps up again to (9,8), but then there's an apple at (2,7) which is to the left. But reaching that would take more moves.\n\nThe apple at (4,6) is directly left. So moving left is a straightforward path. I could also check if there's a chance of another snake blocking me. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not in my path for that apple. Unless the enemy moves into the path, but that's next turns.\n\nSo first move should be LEFT. Then continue left towards the apple at (4,6). Since moving left is safe and takes me towards an apple. Also, since I'm at x=9, moving left is valid. \n\nAnother consideration: apples at (2,7) and (1,3) are further away, but maybe I can get them after. The apple at (4,6) is closer. So this seems like the most efficient move.\n</think>\n\nI will move left to approach the apple at (4,6) on my y-coordinate. This is a direct path with no immediate obstacles. \n\nNext move: LEFT.",

Wait, no, the last move was LEFT, so the head is at (6,6). Wait, no, the original board state shows that the head is at (6,6) with the label '0' in row 6. So maybe the last move was left from (7,6) to (6,6). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the apples available: (1,3), (4,6), (2,7), (7,0), (0,3). The apple at (4,6) is on the same row (y=6) as my current head position (6,6). Wait, if my head is at (6,6), moving left would take me to (5,6), right to (7,6), up to (6,7), or down to (6,5).\n\nThe apple at (4,6) is two steps to the left from (6,6). Since the path is clear (the board shows that at row 6, positions 4 and 6 have apples, so moving left through (5,6) is empty?), I should continue moving left. Wait, looking at the board state given:\n\nRow 6 is \". . . . A . 0 . . .\", which translates from left to right (x=0 to x=9):\n\nAt row 6 (which is y=6?), but wait the board is labeled with y 9 to 0, so lower y is lower. Wait the coordinates are (x,y) where (0,0) is bottom left. So row 0 is at the bottom. So row 6 is middle left. The board shows in row 6 (assuming the y=6 is the 6th row from the bottom, which based on the provided data, the rows are listed from 9 down to 0. So row 6 in the given text is actually y=3? Wait no, the board is printed with 9 at the first line and 0 at the last. So for example, the line starting with \"7 . . A . . . . . . .\" corresponds to y=7. The line \"6 . . . . A . 0 . . .\" is y=6. So in that row, the head is at x=6, y=6.\n\nLooking at row 6: the positions are:\n\nx 0: . \n\nx1: . \n\nx2: . \n\nx3: . \n\nx4: A (apple)\n\nx5: . \n\nx6: 0 (current head position)\n\nx7: . \n\nx8: . \n\nx9: . \n\nWait, the row 6 is \"... A . 0 . .\" So x=4 (since the A is at the fifth position in the line, which would correspond to x=4 (positions start at x=0). So yes, (4,6) is an apple. So the head is at (6,6). Moving left would decrease x by 1 each time. So next move would be to (5,6), then (4,6) where the apple is. So moving LEFT again is safe. Because from (6,6), moving left is to (5,6), which is empty. The apple is at (4,6), so after moving left once, the next move would reach it. So now, the next direction is LEFT. \n\nI need to ensure that there's no snake blocking the path. The enemy snake is at (5,5) in row 5, which is y=5. So moving to (5,6) and then (4,6) is safe. \n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to proceed towards the apple at (4,6).\n</think>\n\nProceeding directly toward the apple at (4,6) since the path is clear. With my snake at (6,6), moving LEFT to (5,6) maintains progress toward the target. The enemy snake is at (5,5) (a row below), so no collision risk in this move. After collecting the apple, the next steps will focus on strategic positioning for subsequent apples like (2,7). \n\nLEFT",

The apples are at (1,3), (4,6), (2,7), (7,0), (0,3). The enemy snake #1 is at (4,3).\n\nFirst, I should check where I can move without dying. My current position is (9,6). The board is 10x10, from (0,0) to (9,9). So, possible moves from the head:\n\n- Up would be increasing y. (9,6) up is (9,7).\n- Down is decreasing y: (9,5).\n- Left is decreasing x: (8,6).\n- Right is increasing x, but x is already at 9, so right is invalid (off the board). So right is out.\n\nNow check if any of the adjacent positions have the enemy snake. Enemy is at (4,3), which isn't adjacent to me. So no collision risk with enemy in the immediate moves. Since my body is none, moving into previous positions isn't a problem.\n\nSo possible moves: up, down, left.\n\nLooking for apples nearby. Let's see: the apple at (4,6) is on the same y-coordinate as my head (6). Since my x is 9, and that apple is at x=4, y=6. So moving left would take me towards that apple. If I move left to (8,6), next move left again could approach that apple. Alternatively, moving down might take me away from that apple, maybe towards others?\n\nWait, my head is at (9,6). So the apple at (4,6) is directly to the left (since x is lower). Also, there's an apple at (2,7), which is left and up a bit. If I move up to (9,7), then left would take me to (8,7), which is closer to the apple at (2,7). \n\nAlternatively, moving down would take me to (9,5), which doesn't seem to be near any apples immediately. The apple at (7,0) is way below, but that's a long way down and left.\n\nSo maybe moving left first is better because it's closer to apples. But wait, if I move left to (8,6), then next move left again, towards (7,6), etc., I could reach the apple at (4,6). That's a direct path. Plus, getting that apple would give me points and grow my body.\n\nLet me check if moving left from (9,6) is safe. The new position would be (8,6). There's no snake there. Enemy is at (4,3), which is not in that path. So yes, moving left is safe. \n\nAlternatively, moving up to (9,7) \u2013 that's also safe. Then perhaps up again to (9,8), but then there's an apple at (2,7) which is to the left. But reaching that would take more moves.\n\nThe apple at (4,6) is directly left. So moving left is a straightforward path. I could also check if there's a chance of another snake blocking me. But since the enemy snake is at (4,3), which is not in my path for that apple. Unless the enemy moves into the path, but that's next turns.\n\nSo first move should be LEFT. Then continue left towards the apple at (4,6). Since moving left is safe and takes me towards an apple. Also, since I'm at x=9, moving left is valid. \n\nAnother consideration: apples at (2,7) and (1,3) are further away, but maybe I can get them after. The apple at (4,6) is closer. So this seems like the most efficient move.\n</think>\n\nI will move left to approach the apple at (4,6) on my y-coordinate. This is a direct path with no immediate obstacles. \n\nNext move: LEFT.",

The apple at (4,6) is in the same row, so moving left should get me closer. Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board state, the apple at (4,6) is still there. The enemy snake is at (5,4). If I keep moving left from (7,6), the next positions would be (6,6), then (5,6), then (4,6). Each of those positions seems empty except (4,6), which has an apple. So moving left again should be safe until I hit that apple.\n\nWait, but what about the enemy snake? They are at (5,4). If they move up next, they might get to (5,5) or (5,6), but that's not immediate. Since my current path is straight left and the enemy is in a different row, there's no collision risk yet. So the next move is LEFT again. Once I hit (4,6), I'll gain a point and grow. Then I need to plan the next apple, maybe (2,7) which is up and left from there.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let me figure out my next move. My snake's head is at (7,6), and the last move was LEFT, which brought me there. Wait, no, the last move was LEFT, so the head is at (6,6). Wait, no, the original board state shows that the head is at (6,6) with the label '0' in row 6. So maybe the last move was left from (7,6) to (6,6). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the apples available: (1,3), (4,6), (2,7), (7,0), (0,3). The apple at (4,6) is on the same row (y=6) as my current head position (6,6). Wait, if my head is at (6,6), moving left would take me to (5,6), right to (7,6), up to (6,7), or down to (6,5).\n\nThe apple at (4,6) is two steps to the left from (6,6). Since the path is clear (the board shows that at row 6, positions 4 and 6 have apples, so moving left through (5,6) is empty?), I should continue moving left. Wait, looking at the board state given:\n\nRow 6 is \". . . . A . 0 . . .\", which translates from left to right (x=0 to x=9):\n\nAt row 6 (which is y=6?), but wait the board is labeled with y 9 to 0, so lower y is lower. Wait the coordinates are (x,y) where (0,0) is bottom left. So row 0 is at the bottom. So row 6 is middle left. The board shows in row 6 (assuming the y=6 is the 6th row from the bottom, which based on the provided data, the rows are listed from 9 down to 0. So row 6 in the given text is actually y=3? Wait no, the board is printed with 9 at the first line and 0 at the last. So for example, the line starting with \"7 . . A . . . . . . .\" corresponds to y=7. The line \"6 . . . . A . 0 . . .\" is y=6. So in that row, the head is at x=6, y=6.\n\nLooking at row 6: the positions are:\n\nx 0: . \n\nx1: . \n\nx2: . \n\nx3: . \n\nx4: A (apple)\n\nx5: . \n\nx6: 0 (current head position)\n\nx7: . \n\nx8: . \n\nx9: . \n\nWait, the row 6 is \"... A . 0 . .\" So x=4 (since the A is at the fifth position in the line, which would correspond to x=4 (positions start at x=0). So yes, (4,6) is an apple. So the head is at (6,6). Moving left would decrease x by 1 each time. So next move would be to (5,6), then (4,6) where the apple is. So moving LEFT again is safe. Because from (6,6), moving left is to (5,6), which is empty. The apple is at (4,6), so after moving left once, the next move would reach it. So now, the next direction is LEFT. \n\nI need to ensure that there's no snake blocking the path. The enemy snake is at (5,5) in row 5, which is y=5. So moving to (5,6) and then (4,6) is safe. \n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to proceed towards the apple at (4,6).\n</think>\n\nProceeding directly toward the apple at (4,6) since the path is clear. With my snake at (6,6), moving LEFT to (5,6) maintains progress toward the target. The enemy snake is at (5,5) (a row below), so no collision risk in this move. After collecting the apple, the next steps will focus on strategic positioning for subsequent apples like (2,7). \n\nLEFT",
