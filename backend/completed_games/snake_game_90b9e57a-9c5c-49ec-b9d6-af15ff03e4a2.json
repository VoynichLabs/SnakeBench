I'm currently positioned at (2, 1), and my goal is to collect the apples while avoiding any potential dangers.\n\nI've decided to aim for the apple at (8, 0), which seems like a good target. However, to get there, I'll need to move right towards the apple at (2, 2) first. That's my current plan, but I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy based on any new information.\n\nAfter analyzing my options, I think my best bet is to fail to reach the apple at (8, 0) and instead make a U-turn upwards to reach the apple at (2, 9). So, my new strategy is: Move right to reach the area where I can make a U-turn, and then go up to (2, 9).\n\nHowever, I'll need to make a bit of a curve to the right, and then I should be able to go straight upwards. Given the new strategy, I need to end up on the row where the apple at (2, 9) is.\n\nSo, let's say I move RIGHT, then make a turn upwards. To make that U-turn, I need to head RIGHT then UP, UP.\n\nRethinking this... if I move RIGHT, then I can go LEFT afterwards and make my way up.
