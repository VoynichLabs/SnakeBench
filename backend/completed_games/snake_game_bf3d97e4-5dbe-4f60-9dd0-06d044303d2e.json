We only have two safe options: moving UP to (0,7) or moving RIGHT to (1,6) (moving DOWN would go back into our own body, and LEFT is off\u2010board).\n\nComparing the targets, we see two clusters of accessible apples:\n\u2022 One pair in the top row at (1,9) and (2,9), which we can approach by going upward and then shifting right.\n\u2022 Another apple at (4,6) which is reachable along our current row if we head RIGHT.\n\nBoth options are roughly four moves away (for example, from (0,6) to (1,9) via an upward/right path versus heading right along row 6 toward (4,6)). However, by moving UP toward (0,7) we keep our head along the left edge where our body isn\u2019t in the way and maintain plenty of open space. Once we\u2019re on column 0, we\u2019ll have easy access to (0,8) and then (0,9) \u2013 from where a rightward move will allow us to grab the apple at (1,9) without risk of boxing ourselves in.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake\u2019s activity is concentrated on the right side of the board, so by continuing upward on the left side we stay clear of any possible conflict.\n\nBased on these considerations, I want to continue our previous strategy of moving upward to open space and track one of the nearby apples. \n\nNext move: UP."

Our head is now at (3,8) (we ate the apple on our last RIGHT move), and our body extends to [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]. The enemy snake\u2019s head is at (4,6) with a bulky cluster of segments in the mid\u2010to\u2011upper right of the board. The remaining apples are at (1,4), (0,0), (8,5), (5,1) and (5,3).\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check our four options from (3,8):\n\n\u2022 LEFT leads to (2,8) but that square is part of our own body.\n\u2022 UP goes to (3,9). Although (3,9) is free, it\u2019s right against the top wall \u2013 that would leave us with very few options (essentially only the square (4,9) would be open next turn) and no clear route to an apple.\n\u2022 RIGHT goes to (4,8). That square is free, but it places us closer to the enemy\u2019s mass (remember enemy segments occupy much of rows 8\u20139 to the right, including (5,8) and nearby squares), so we might feel boxed in.\n\u2022 DOWN leads to (3,7). This square is free and\u2014crucially\u2014it opens up movement in three directions on the following turn (left to (2,7), right to (4,7), or further down to (3,6)). Although it puts us a bit nearer the enemy head at (4,6) (Manhattan distance 2), it keeps our options wider and actually shifts us toward the apple at (1,4) (which is only 5 moves away in Manhattan distance from (3,7)).\n\nI\u2019ve also looked at how our own body is arranged. Our segments form a barrier along the far left (with a column of T\u2019s at x=0 from y=5 up) and also cross the board near x=2. If we head RIGHT, we run the risk of getting wedged between enemy segments and our own tail. On the other hand, moving DOWN seems to steer us clear of congested territory and offers more flexibility to later target an apple once the board \u201copens up\u201d a bit (with our tail eventually moving).\n\nIn summary, while RIGHT and UP are both technically safe for one turn, DOWN gives us a better chance to maintain room to maneuver and start working on a path toward an apple (especially (1,4)) without immediately entering the enemy\u2019s crowded zone.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: DOWN."

Here\u2019s how the two options look:\n\n\u2022 If we go LEFT to (1,7):\n\u2003\u2013 Our new head will be one column closer to apple (1,4). From (1,7) the Manhattan distance is |1\u20131| + |7\u20134| = 3.\n\u2003\u2013 Being in column 1 keeps us farther from the enemy snake\u2019s cluster (which is mostly over in columns 3\u20135).\n\u2003\u2013 In subsequent moves we can go down to (1,6) and then further down toward (1,4). Although some of our body is currently along the left edge, it will gradually clear as our tail is removed.\n\n\u2022 If we go DOWN to (2,6):\n\u2003\u2013 Our new head will also be closer to (1,4), with a distance |2\u20131| + |6\u20134| = 3.\n\u2003\u2013 However, (2,6) is a little more toward the center, and that brings us one step closer to the enemy snake\u2019s pieces to our right.\n\u2003\u2013 We\u2019d soon have to turn LEFT anyway to reach (1,4), and it feels safer to keep our head already in the leftward corridor.\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance to the apple, but steering our head further left now (into (1,7)) seems to keep us farther away from the enemy\u2019s congestion while heading in the right overall direction.\n\nThus, my plan is:\n1. Move LEFT now to (1,7).\n2. Next turns I will likely continue downward (to (1,6) then (1,5)) and then finally hit the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo my decided next move is: LEFT."
