Moving RIGHT would place my head onto my own body segment at (8,7), which is an immediate suicide, so it is eliminated. Moving LEFT would take me to (6,7), a vacant cell that is not currently occupied by any snake, so it is safe. Moving UP would place me at (7,8), also safe, while moving DOWN would take me to (7,6), another empty cell. I consider the apples on the board and note that the closest ones are at (8,9) and (6,5), both only three steps away in Manhattan distance. The apple at (8,9) lies to my right and up, but I cannot move right this turn because it would kill me, so I must seek another route. The apple at (6,5) lies down and left, which is reachable by moving left now and then downward in subsequent turns. I also note that the enemy snake #0 occupies cells at (7,5), (8,5), and (9,5), all at a lower y\u2011coordinate, so moving left keeps me away from its current head. If I were to move DOWN to (7,6), the enemy could potentially move UP into the same cell, causing a head\u2011on collision that would kill both of us. Moving LEFT does not place me directly in the line of fire of the enemy\u2019s most likely upward move, making it the least risky option. Moreover, moving LEFT opens up two future directions \u2014 DOWN and UP \u2014 while still leaving the possibility to head toward the (6,5) apple after a couple of steps. My short\u2011term plan is to crawl leftward this turn, then in the next turn move down to (6,6) and finally down again to (6,5) to eat that apple. This sequence keeps my body extending away from the enemy and preserves multiple safe follow\u2011up moves. My long\u2011term plan for the next few turns is to continue moving down along the x=6 column until I reach the apple at (6,5), then turn left to explore the cluster near (4,6) and (5,5). \nLEFT",

I can collect the apple at (4, 6) immediately, which increases my score to 5 and gives me a 1-apple lead over the enemy. The enemy snake at (4, 7) won't collide with me because they're one cell above where I'm moving. Even if they move down to (4, 6), we'd collide, but let me check: their head is at (4, 7) and my head is at (4, 5). If I move UP to (4, 6) and they move DOWN, we'd meet at (4, 6) - that would be a head-on collision and we'd both die. However, looking at the board, the enemy snake is short (length 2) and has only eaten 1 apple. It's more likely they'll pursue their own strategy.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider the collision risk. If the enemy moves DOWN from (4, 7) to (4, 6) at the same time I move UP from (4, 5) to (4, 6), we would collide head-to-head and both die. This is a risk.\n\nHowever, looking at the game state, I'm ahead 4-1 in apples. The enemy has limited options and is unlikely to move directly into me. The upside of getting an apple outweighs the collision risk here, especially since the enemy's behavior suggests they're moving independently.\n\nLet me reconsider: Is there a safer move? LEFT and DOWN are both safe but don't gain apples. Given my lead, I should be aggressive and collect the nearby apple.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\n- Turn 8: Move UP to (4, 6) - collect apple, score becomes 5\n- Turn 9+: After collecting (4, 6), reassess enemy position and plan route to remaining apples: (0, 5), (8, 9), (4, 0), or (9, 7)\n- Maintain aggressive apple collection while staying aware of enemy movements\n- Current lead of 4-1 in apples is significant\n\nUP",

Safe but moves away from nearby apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: Empty cell. Safe and moves toward the (2, 7) apple.\n\n**Eliminated moves:**\n- DOWN is eliminated (moving into own body)\n\n**Remaining safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 7), which is 1 RIGHT and 1 DOWN from my current position. If I go RIGHT to (2, 8), then on the next turn I can go DOWN to (2, 7) to collect it.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: This moves me directly toward the (2, 7) apple. After this move, I'd be at (2, 8), and the (2, 7) apple would be directly below me. Very efficient path.\n\n- **UP to (1, 9)**: This moves away from nearby apples. While safe, it doesn't advance toward my objective.\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 8)**: This also moves away from nearby apples and the main apple cluster in the upper-left and lower-left areas.\n\n**Head-on collision check:**\nEnemy snake at (3, 8) will move. Possible directions from (3, 8):\n- If it goes LEFT to (2, 8), that's where I'd be - head-on collision!\n- If it goes RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, no collision with my planned move\n\nHowever, the enemy snake's body is [(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)], which blocks many of its movements. It has limited space. The enemy snake going LEFT is less likely since (2, 8) is somewhat random. But I need to be cautious.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: if the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 8), we collide and both die. But given the risk/reward, moving RIGHT toward the apple is still my best bet since:\n1. It advances toward collecting more apples\n2. (2, 8) is not the most obvious move for the enemy\n3. I need to maintain my lead (17 vs 4 apples)\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 44: RIGHT to (2, 8) - approach the (2, 7) apple\n- Turn 45: DOWN to (2, 7) - collect apple #18\n- Then continue gathering the remaining apples in the lower portion of the board\n\nRIGHT",

DEATH. Eliminate.\n2. **UP to (2, 7)**: This is my own body (at position 0 in body list). DEATH. Eliminate.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6)**: This is my own body (at position 4 in body list). DEATH. Eliminate.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6)**: This is enemy snake #1's body (at position 1). DEATH. Eliminate.\n\nWait, this analysis shows all moves are blocked! Let me reconsider the body positions after my last move.\n\nActually, after I moved DOWN from (2, 7) to (2, 6), my body should have shifted:\n- New head: (2, 6)\n- New body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2)]\n\nSo the tail at (8, 2) was removed (since I didn't eat an apple).\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n- DOWN to (2, 5): Body occupies (2, 5). DEATH.\n- UP to (2, 7): Body occupies (2, 7). DEATH.\n- LEFT to (1, 6): Body occupies (1, 6). DEATH.\n- RIGHT to (3, 6): Enemy occupies (3, 6). DEATH.\n\nThis is a critical situation! I'm completely surrounded by my own body and the enemy snake. This appears to be a trap I created for myself.\n\nLet me double-check the board visualization:\nRow 6: . T 0 T 1 . . . . .\n- Position (1, 6): T (my body)\n- Position (2, 6): 0 (my head)\n- Position (3, 6): T (enemy body)\n- Position (4, 6): 1 (enemy head)\n\nAnd below:\nRow 5: . T T T . . . . . .\n- (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5): My body\n\nI'm indeed trapped. All four directions lead to collision. This is a losing position - I cannot survive this turn regardless of which move I make. However, I must choose one direction.\n\nGiven that all moves result in death, I'll choose the move that's most \"natural\" following my previous trajectory, which was DOWN. At least this keeps with my momentum.\n\nDOWN",

This move does not step onto our own body and does not place us in a cell that the enemy head can easily reach, so it remains safe regardless of the opponent\u2019s unknown direction.\n\nPlan: Continue heading down to approach the low\u2011lying apples, then shift right to collect the apples at (6,4) and (2,4) while maintaining alternative escape routes.\n\nDOWN",
