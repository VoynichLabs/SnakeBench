          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy head is at (9, 2). The board is 10x10, so x and y go from 0 to 9. Coordinates are a bit confusing because Y increases going up. So (0,0) is bottom left, (9,9) is top right.\n\nApples available are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible. Also, I need to avoid dying by hitting the walls, my own body, or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake: it's at (6,4) with no body. So it's a single segment as well. Since all snakes move at the same time, I have to consider that both snakes might move into each other.\n\nCurrent move is Turn 0 out of 150. I haven't collected any apples yet, same as the enemy. The main objectives here are to survive and collect apples.\n\nFirst, let's check all possible moves. The options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\nUP from (9,2) would take me to (9,3). Is that safe? Let's see. What's in those coordinates? Looking at the board state:\n\nRow 9 (top row) has apples at (4,9) and (1,9). Then row 8 is empty. Row 7 is empty. Row 6: apple at (4,9) (wait, no, row 6 is (4,6) no, wait the apples are at (4,9)? Wait the apples listed are (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). So (4,9) is in row 9, x=4, y=9. Similarly, (1,9) is row 9, x=1. So (9,3) is row 3, x=9. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 3 (y=3) has apple at (1,3). So (9,3) is empty. But there's an enemy snake at (6,4). So if I move up to (9,3), what's the danger? Not immediately. But then, the enemy snake's movement depends on their chosen direction. But I don't know their next move. However, since all snakes move simultaneously, I have to assume that the enemy could move into my position or vice versa.\n\nWait, the collision rules say if two heads move into the same cell, both die. So if I move to a cell that the enemy might move into, but since we both choose moves at the same time, I need to make sure that my next position doesn't collide with any other snake's next position.\n\nBut since I don't know the enemy's move, I have to assume they might move in any direction. However, the enemy's current head is at (6,4). Possible moves for them are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If they move UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4). So if I move to (9,3), which is a different column and row, it's not overlapping. So that's safe for now.\n\nBut maybe moving up gives me a better path towards apples. The apples are mostly in rows 0,1,3,9. The higher apples (like (1,9) and (4,9)) are in the top row. So maybe moving towards those could be good, but I need to avoid walls. Moving up from (9,2) to (9,3) is safe, but if I keep moving up, I might reach (9,4), (9,5), etc., but there's no apples there except maybe (1,9) is in row 9, but moving left from (9,3) would be required to get to (1,9), which is far. Alternatively, maybe moving left or right could get into a position where I can reach apples more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the apples in lower rows: (2,0) and (2,1) are near the bottom. Since (0,0) is the bottom left, but my current position is (9,2). Moving down from (9,2) would go to (9,1). That's close to the bottom edge. If I move down to (9,1), then next move down to (9,0), but that's the edge. Then next move down would be off the board. So moving down gives me a way to reach lower apples, but with limited space there.\n\nBut my current position is (9,2). Let me check each direction:\n\nUP: (9,3). Check if that's adjacent to any snake. The enemy is at (6,4). So distance is 3 in x and 1 in y. Not adjacent. So moving up is safe. Also, not into my own body because I have no body yet.\n\nDOWN: (9,1). Similarly, check if that's safe. The enemy's position is at (6,4), so not adjacent. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (8,2). Again, check if that's safe. The enemy's position is at (6,4), so (8,2) is two cells left. No collision. Safe.\n\nRIGHT: (10,2). Wait, x can't be 10. The board is 0-9. So moving right from x=9 would be x=10, which is off the board. So RIGHT is invalid because it's off the board. So RIGHT is eliminated immediately.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, among these three, which is best?\n\nLet me evaluate each direction for immediate safety and future options.\n\nUP to (9,3): This is towards the top. There are apples at (1,9) and (4,9) in the top row. But to reach those, I need to move left. However, moving up might allow me to go towards those apples. However, the enemy is at (6,4), which is in a different column and row. If I move up, maybe there's a path towards (1,9) or (4,9), but I need to navigate around the enemy. Alternatively, maybe moving left to get closer to the apples on the same row (like (4,9) is row 9, but I'm moving up to row 3, which is lower. Wait, (4,9) is in row 9, which is higher up. Hmm. So (4,9) is in the top row, same as (1,9). So moving up might help get closer to those apples, but I need to navigate left as well.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) and then maybe left towards row 0 or 1 where there are apples at (2,0) and (2,1). That might be a shorter path. Let's see: from (9,1), moving left would take me through x=8,7,... to x=2, then down to (2,0) or (2,1). But how many steps would that take? From (9,1) to (2,1) would be 7 steps left. Then down to (2,0) is another step. But that's 8 moves. Alternatively, if I move down to (9,1), then left to (2,1) would be 7 left moves, then down to (2,0) for an apple. That's possible, but might take time, and I need to avoid other snakes.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (8,2). That's one step left. Maybe that's a neutral move, allowing flexibility. Then from there, I can consider other directions. But if I left, I might be moving away from the apples in row 9 or towards lower rows.\n\nSo which direction gives the best balance between safety and progress towards apples?\n\nAnother factor is future moves. For example, if I move up to (9,3), then next move could be left to (8,3), etc., towards (1,9) or (4,9). But the enemy's position is (6,4). Suppose the enemy moves down towards row 3. If I'm moving up to (9,3), and the enemy moves down to (6,3), then next turn, if I move left, maybe they could collide or I could get into a position where they attack.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) brings me closer to the lower apples. But (9,1) is adjacent to (9,0), which is an edge. If I go down to (9,0), next move can't go down again, so maybe I can go left from there. But (9,0) is adjacent to the bottom edge, so moving down again would be invalid. So maybe moving down first to reach (9,1) is a step towards getting lower apples.\n\nBut perhaps the apples at (2,0) and (2,1) are closer in terms of steps needed. Let's calculate the Manhattan distance from current head to each apple:\n\nFor (4,9): distance is |9-4| + |2-9| = 5 +7=12 units.\n\nFor (1,9): |9-1| + |2-9| =8 +7=15.\n\nFor (1,3): |9-1| + |2-3|=8+1=9.\n\nFor (2,1): |9-2| + |2-1|=7+1=8.\n\nFor (2,0): |9-2| + |2-0|=7+2=9.\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,1) at 8 units, followed by (2,0) at 9. The top apples are further away. So maybe moving towards (2,1) or (2,0) is better. But how?\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to go left 7 steps and down 1 step. So moving left would get me closer. But from (9,2), moving left to (8,2), then left again, etc. However, if I move LEFT to (8,2), that's progress towards (2,1) but takes 7 steps. Alternatively, moving down to (9,1) and then left would be 1 step down and 7 steps left, same total steps. So maybe either direction.\n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (9,1), then the next step could be LEFT to (8,1), which is closer to (2,1). So perhaps moving down first is better.\n\nBut there's also the enemy to consider. The enemy is at (6,4). If I move down towards (9,1) or left towards (8,2), the enemy might move in a direction that puts them in my path.\n\nBut since we don't know the enemy's move, we have to make a move that maximizes our survival and apple collection.\n\nAnother consideration is the possibility of the enemy moving into our position. For example, if I move up to (9,3), and the enemy moves up to (6,5), that's safe. If they move left to (5,4), then next turn they could approach. But it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT would allow me to avoid the enemy's possible movements. If I move left to (8,2), then the enemy at (6,4) could move left or right. Suppose they move up to (6,5), then I could proceed left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) is a safe move, but if the enemy is moving down, they might come into my path. For example, if the enemy moves down to (6,3) or (6,5). But again, not sure.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that each time I collect an apple, I grow a segment. So starting with a head-only snake, after collecting one apple, I'll have a body. That body could restrict my movement, so maybe I want to collect apples in a way that allows me to maneuver.\n\nBut for now, we have no body. So the immediate safety is key.\n\nSo the possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet me evaluate each:\n\nUP: (9,3). Safe. Then next moves could be left to approach the top apples. But maybe it's a longer path.\n\nDOWN: (9,1). Closer to lower apples but requires moving down first. Safe.\n\nLEFT: (8,2). Neutral, but moving left towards x=2. Safe.\n\nWhich of these gives the best combination of safety and progress towards apples.\n\nLooking at the apples, (2,1) is 7 left and 1 down. So from (9,2), moving left would decrease x, which is needed. But moving left all the way would take 7 steps. Alternatively, moving down first to (9,1) and then left would be same distance but maybe safer in terms of not being in a straight line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down to get closer vertically to the lower apples. Let's see: (2,1) is at y=1, which is two steps down from (9,2). So moving down to (9,1) is one step towards that apple's y-coordinate. Then moving left from (9,1) to (8,1), etc.\n\nSo moving down first could be better for reaching (2,1) and (2,0).\n\nAlternatively, moving left first could be better if I can get to x=2 quickly. But the enemy is at x=6. If I move left, maybe the enemy could come in from the side? For example, if the enemy moves right from (6,4) to (7,4), then next turn maybe to (8,4), but that's not directly threatening my path.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (8,2), then my next direction could be left again, but maybe that's too slow. Or maybe move down from (8,2) to (8,1), etc.\n\nAlternatively, the board's layout: looking at the coordinates, the apples at (4,9) and (1,9) are in the top row. To reach them, I need to get to x=1 or 4 and y=9. From (9,2), moving up to (9,3) would start moving towards y=9, but x is 9. So need to move left a lot. That's 8 left moves from x=9 to x=1. That's 8 steps. But moving left from (9,2) to (8,2) is one step. So perhaps moving left first isn't as helpful as moving towards the lower apples which are closer in steps.\n\nWait, the distance to (2,1) is 7 left and 1 down. So if I move down once, then need to move left 7 times. If I move left once, same situation. So both directions are needed. But maybe moving down first gives me a chance to get closer to the lower apples with fewer steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. For example, if I move down to (9,1), then left to (8,1), then down to (8,0) but (8,0) is not an apple. Or move left from (9,1) to (8,1), then to (7,1), etc. But that's 7 left moves to reach x=2. So maybe it's the same steps either way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving left first is better because I can start moving towards x=2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother aspect is the enemy's position. The enemy is at (6,4). If I move UP to (9,3), then in the next turn, if the enemy moves towards me, maybe they could collide. But since all snakes move simultaneously, if I move to (9,3) and the enemy moves to (9,3), then we collide. But that's unlikely unless the enemy chooses to move there. Since the enemy's current position is (6,4), moving to (9,3) would require a lot of movement. So maybe not a collision risk.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1): the enemy is at (6,4). The distance between (9,1) and (6,4) is 3 in x and 3 in y. So not adjacent. So collision risk is low.\n\nSo all three directions are safe. Now, which direction gives the best progress towards apples?\n\nThe apples at (2,1) and (2,0) are closer in steps (8 steps from current position). The apples at (1,9) and (4,9) are further. So maybe focusing on the lower apples is better.\n\nSo moving DOWN might be better. Let's think: from (9,2), moving DOWN to (9,1). Then next move could be LEFT to (8,1), which is closer to (2,1). So two moves. But each move must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (8,2), then next move could be DOWN to (8,1), then left again. So same number of steps.\n\nBut the key is which move now is best. Since the enemy is at (6,4), moving down might not interfere. However, if the enemy moves down towards y=3 or lower, maybe they could interfere.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the board's current apples. There's an apple at (2,0) and (2,1). If I can reach those quickly, I can collect them before the enemy. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving LEFT is better because it starts moving towards x=2. But moving left from (9,2) to (8,2) is one step. Then next move could be left again. But if I keep moving left, I can reach x=2 in 7 steps. Then down to (2,1) or (2,0). But that's 7+1=8 steps. Same as moving down first.\n\nBut maybe moving down first to (9,1) and then left could allow me to collect apples in a more efficient path. For example, from (9,1), moving left to (2,1) in 7 steps. Then collect the apple there. Then maybe move down to (2,0) to get another apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT first and then down. But again, same steps.\n\nHmm. Maybe the difference is in immediate safety. All moves are safe now, but future moves might be affected.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move UP, I might be able to collect apples in the top row, but those are further away. Collecting those would require more steps. But if I can get there before the enemy, maybe. However, with the enemy at (6,4), if they move towards the top, maybe they could block my path. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP might also put me in a position where I can turn around or adjust. For example, if I go up to (9,3), then maybe I can move left or down next. But it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is the safest bet because it's moving towards the apples in x=2. But again, need to see.\n\nAlternatively, think about the next turn's possible moves. For example, if I move UP to (9,3), then next turn's possible moves could be LEFT to (8,3), UP to (9,4), etc. But if I move DOWN to (9,1), next turn could be LEFT to (8,1), which is closer to the apple at (2,1).\n\nWait, the apple at (2,1) is at (2,1). From (9,1), moving left 7 steps would get me there. From (9,3), moving left to (8,3), etc., would take me to (2,3), then down to (2,1) in two steps. So that's 9 steps total. Whereas moving down first gives 8 steps. So maybe moving down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (9,1) now and then proceed left is better. Let's see:\n\nCurrent position: (9,2)\n\nMove DOWN to (9,1). Then next move could be LEFT to (8,1), then LEFT again to (7,1), etc. Each step left brings me closer to x=2.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (8,2), then next move could be DOWN to (8,1), then LEFT again. Same steps.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN is better because it brings me closer to the lower apples, which are closer in terms of total steps required.\n\nAnother thing to note: the apples at (2,0) and (2,1) are on the same x-axis (x=2). So moving towards x=2 is necessary. So moving LEFT is necessary, but how to get there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining both directions. For example, moving down then left, or left then down.\n\nBut since the current move is only one direction, I need to choose one.\n\nAnother angle: the enemy is at (6,4). If I move DOWN to (9,1), then the enemy could potentially move towards me. For example, if they move down to (6,3), then next turn they could approach. But since they are at (6,4), moving down to (6,3) would be safe from me moving to (9,1). The distance between (6,3) and (9,1) is 3 in x and 2 in y. Not adjacent, so no collision.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves right towards (7,4), then maybe they could intercept me if I'm moving left. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (8,2) might be a neutral move, but maybe not as effective in progressing towards apples.\n\nAnother thought: since I need to avoid moving backwards into my own body. Currently, I have no body, so that's not an issue. Once I collect an apple, I'll grow. So maybe the first move is to collect an apple, but none of the four directions from (9,2) leads directly to an apple. The closest apple is (2,1) which is 8 steps away.\n\nWait, (9,2) to (2,1): x difference is 7 left, y difference is 1 down. So total 8 steps. So not adjacent. So no apple adjacent to current head. So any direction doesn't immediately collect an apple. So the first move should be a safe move that positions me towards the nearest apples.\n\nThe nearest apples are (2,1) (8 steps) and (2,0) (9 steps). So moving towards x=2 and lower y.\n\nSo between UP, DOWN, LEFT:\n\nUP moves me to (9,3). From there, to reach (2,1), need to move left 7 and down 2. Total 9 steps.\n\nDOWN moves to (9,1). From there, left 7 and down 0. Total 7 steps (since y is already 1).\n\nLEFT moves to (8,2). From there, left 6 and down 1. Total 7 steps.\n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT options would lead to the apple in 7 steps. UP would take longer.\n\nSo between DOWN and LEFT. Which is better?\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,1), then next move could be LEFT to (8,1), which is one step towards x=2. Then continue left until (2,1). So that's a straight path.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8,2), then next move could be DOWN to (8,1), then left. Alternatively, keep moving left. Either way, same number of steps.\n\nBut moving DOWN might allow me to reach (9,1), which is one step closer to (2,1) in terms of x. Wait, no. From (9,1), moving left each time. From (8,2), same. The difference is the y-coordinate. If I'm at (9,1), I'm closer to (2,1)'s y-coordinate. So that might be better.\n\nAdditionally, being at (9,1) is closer to (2,1) in terms of Manhattan distance: |9-2| + |1-1| =7. Whereas from (8,2), it's |8-2| + |2-1|=6+1=7. So same distance. So both moves are equally good in that aspect.\n\nHmm. So maybe it's a tie between DOWN and LEFT. Then I need to consider other factors.\n\nAnother factor: avoiding potential collisions with the enemy. Suppose I move DOWN to (9,1). The enemy is at (6,4). If they move LEFT to (5,4), then (5,4) to (9,1) is still far. If they move UP, they go to (6,5). Not a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT to (8,2), the enemy could move in some direction. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's moving towards the apples more directly. Because the apple at (2,1) is in x=2. So moving left reduces x. So each LEFT move brings me closer. Whereas moving DOWN brings me closer to y=1, which is needed for (2,1). So both are necessary.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after moving DOWN to (9,1), the next move could be LEFT to (8,1), then LEFT to (7,1), etc. That's a straight line. Whereas moving LEFT from (9,2) to (8,2) and then DOWN to (8,1) would also be a path. So both are possible.\n\nBut in terms of immediate progress towards x=2, moving LEFT starts reducing x now. So maybe LEFT is better.\n\nWait, the apple is at x=2, so to get there from x=9, need 7 left moves. So moving LEFT now is a direct step towards that.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) and then LEFT would require 7 left moves. Same total distance. But maybe moving LEFT now is better because it starts reducing x immediately.\n\nBut maybe there's a path blocked. For example, if there's a wall or other snakes. But in this case, the board is mostly empty except for apples and the enemy.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy's head is at (6,4). If I move LEFT to (8,2), then the enemy could move in some direction. Suppose they move LEFT to (5,4), then next turn I'm at (7,2), etc. Not a collision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better to start progressing towards the apple.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after moving LEFT to (8,2), I can then move DOWN to (8,1), which is closer to the apple. So maybe that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) and then LEFT to (8,1) would be two moves needed to get to (8,1), whereas moving LEFT then DOWN would be same steps.\n\nSo perhaps both moves are similar in progress. Then maybe safety is a factor.\n\nWait, when considering future moves after this, which direction allows more flexibility or safer moves next turn.\n\nFor example, moving UP to (9,3) might restrict future moves if I keep going up, but since the board is 10x10, moving up from (9,3) to (9,4), etc., is possible until (9,9). But there are no apples there except at (1,9) and (4,9). So unless I go left, I won't get them.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) gives me a position closer to the apples at (2,0) and (2,1). And the lower row (y=0,1) might have less enemies coming towards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's a more direct path towards x=2. Let's see: from (8,2), moving left each time until x=2. Then down to y=1 or 0. That would take 6 left moves and 1 down. Total 7 moves. But same as before.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the ENEMY is at (6,4). If I move LEFT to (8,2), then in the next turn, if the enemy moves in some direction, perhaps towards me. For example, if they move right to (7,4), then they are not in my path. But if they move down to (6,3), then (6,3) is a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not a big threat right now. Since their head is at (6,4), which is a few cells away from my path towards x=2. So maybe collision risk is low.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after each move, my snake doesn't grow unless I collect an apple. Since I start with no body, all moves are safe as long as I don't hit walls or enemies.\n\nSo given that all three directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe, which one is optimal.\n\nThe key is which direction brings me closer to the nearest apples. Since (2,1) is the closest apple (7 left and 1 down), moving LEFT or DOWN.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I am moving towards x=2, which is where the apple is. If I move DOWN, I am moving towards y=1, which is where the apple is. So both directions contribute to getting closer to the apple.\n\nBut how many steps?\n\nFor example:\n\nMoving LEFT from (9,2) to (8,2). Then next move could be LEFT again or DOWN. Each LEFT reduces x by 1. To reach x=2, need 6 more LEFT moves. Then from x=2, need to go down to y=1 (if at x=2, y=2, then down to y=1). Wait, from (8,2), moving LEFT to (7,2), etc., until x=2 at (2,2). Then down to (2,1). So total steps: 7 LEFT to get from x=9 to x=2, then 1 DOWN. Total 8 steps.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) first: then moving LEFT 7 times to x=2. That's 7 steps. So moving DOWN first allows me to reach (2,1) in 7 steps (DOWN to (9,1), then 7 LEFTs). Whereas moving LEFT first would take 7 LEFTs plus 1 DOWN. So same total steps.\n\nBut moving DOWN first allows me to have a y-coordinate of 1 earlier, which is needed for the apple. But since I need both x and y to reach (2,1), maybe moving in either direction is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN first is better because once I'm at (9,1), I can move left 7 times without worrying about the enemy's position as much. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the enemy's possible moves. The enemy is at (6,4). If I move LEFT to (8,2), the enemy could move down to (6,3) or up to (6,5), etc. Not directly threatening.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (9,1) is closer to the lower apples. Suppose I reach (2,1) in 7 steps. Then I can collect that apple and grow. Then maybe move towards (2,0) or other apples.\n\nAnother thing: the apples at (2,0) and (2,1) are on the same x. So getting to x=2 is crucial. So any move that reduces x is good.\n\nSo moving LEFT now is progressing towards x=2. Moving DOWN now doesn't reduce x but reduces y. So maybe LEFT is better.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after moving DOWN to (9,1), I can then move LEFT 7 times. But if I move LEFT now, I start reducing x.\n\nSo perhaps moving LEFT is better.\n\nBut wait, from (9,2), moving LEFT to (8,2) is a step towards x=2. Then next move LEFT again. So each LEFT move gets me closer. Whereas moving DOWN first doesn't contribute to x reduction.\n\nSo in terms of progress towards the apple at (2,1), moving LEFT is better. Because each LEFT step brings me closer. Whereas moving DOWN only brings me closer to y=1, but not x.\n\nSo if I need to reach x=2, moving LEFT is necessary. So perhaps LEFT is a better first move.\n\nBut then again, after moving LEFT to (8,2), I need to continue LEFT 6 more times. Then move down.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first allows me to start moving in that direction. But maybe the path towards (2,1) requires both steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe splitting the steps between moving LEFT and DOWN is needed. But since I can only choose one direction per turn, I need to choose which direction to prioritize.\n\nSince the x-coordinate is a larger component (7 needed to reach 2), maybe prioritizing LEFT makes more sense. Because collecting x steps might be more time-sensitive? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN allows me to get closer vertically to the apple, which is at y=1. So after moving DOWN to (9,1), the apple is one step leftward. Wait, no. The apple is at (2,1). So from (9,1), I need to move left 7 times.\n\nBut if I move LEFT from (9,2) to (8,2), then next move could be DOWN to (8,1), which is one step towards y=1. So combining both directions.\n\nBut again, since I can only choose one direction per turn, I need to pick which direction now.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the board's layout. The apples in row 0 and 1 (y=0 and 1) are in the lower part. So moving DOWN towards that area might allow me to collect apples there, which are closer in steps than the top apples.\n\nSo maybe moving DOWN is better because the apples there are closer in total steps. Wait, (2,1) is 8 steps away. (4,9) is 12 steps. So yes, lower apples are closer.\n\nSo perhaps moving DOWN to get to (9,1), then move left 7 steps to reach (2,1). That's 8 moves. But if I move LEFT first, it's 7 steps left and then 1 step down. Either way, same number of steps. So maybe the order doesn't matter. But perhaps moving LEFT first allows me to start reducing x, which is a larger component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path that allows me to collect multiple apples. For example, if I can reach (2,1), then maybe (2,0) is next. But that's another step down.\n\nBut in any case, the first move needs to be safe and make progress.\n\nAnother thought: since the enemy is at (6,4), if I move LEFT, I'm getting further away in x from them. Because I'm moving from x=9 to 8, while they are at x=6. So their x is 6, mine would be 8. So increasing distance. Whereas if I move DOWN or UP, my x remains 9 or same.\n\nSo moving LEFT increases the distance from the enemy. That might be safer. Because if they move towards me, maybe they can't reach me as easily if I'm moving left.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN might not affect the distance as much. For example, moving to (9,1) is still in x=9, same as before. The enemy is at x=6, so distance in x is 3. So moving LEFT reduces that distance (from 3 to 2 if enemy moves right, but not sure).\n\nBut since the enemy's movement is unknown, it's hard to predict. However, reducing x distance might be better for avoiding them.\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (8,2), the distance in x from the enemy (6,4) is now 8-6=2. Previously it was 9-6=3. So moving LEFT reduces the x distance by 1. That could be a good thing, but not sure if that's relevant for collision risk.\n\nWait, collision happens if our next positions overlap. Since all snakes move simultaneously, if we move LEFT to (8,2), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,4), then no collision. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves LEFT to (5,4), then next turn, they are at x=5. So distance between x=5 and my new x=8 is 3. So moving LEFT gets me to x=8, which is still 2 away from enemy's x=6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT is better because it's making progress towards the apple and reducing x distance from the enemy. Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after moving LEFT, I have more options to snack on apples in the left direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better because it's a straighter path towards the apples. Let me think: to reach (2,1), I need to go left 7 and down 1. If I move DOWN first, then I'm at (9,1), and then need to move left 7. Total 8 steps. If I move LEFT first, then from (8,2), I can move DOWN later.\n\nBut maybe there's a possibility that after moving LEFT, I can then move in a direction that allows me to collect multiple apples. For example, if I can move LEFT to x=2 and then collect both (2,1) and (2,0) apples. But that depends on future moves.\n\nAlternatively, since both apples are at x=2, once I reach x=2, I can move down between y=1 and y=0 to collect both apples. That would take two additional moves.\n\nSo in total, after moving LEFT 7 times, I reach (2,2), then need to move down to (2,1) and (2,0). But that's 7 LEFT + 2 DOWN = 9 moves. Whereas moving DOWN first to (9,1), then LEFT 7 to (2,1) (collect one apple), then DOWN to (2,0) (collect another). That's 8 moves total.\n\nSo which is better? The path via DOWN first allows collecting two apples in 8 moves, whereas the path via LEFT first would take 9 moves to collect the same two apples. But maybe not, because after collecting (2,1), moving down to (2,0) would be another step.\n\nBut regardless, the first move needs to be chosen. Since both DOWN and LEFT are safe and contribute to the path, but LEFT moves me directly towards x=2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal first move is LEFT because it starts reducing the distance to the closest apple in terms of x-coordinate. Since x needs to be 2, and the enemy is at x=6, moving LEFT brings me closer to x=2. Whereas DOWN doesn't help with x.\n\nSo considering that, LEFT seems better. But I need to check if moving LEFT is safe.\n\nYes, it's safe. So direction options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, between those three.\n\nAnother point: the apple at (1,9) is in the top row. If I move UP to (9,3), then I can start moving left towards that apple. But (9,3) is 8 left and 6 up from (4,9). Whereas (2,1) is 7 left and 1 down. So the lower apple is closer.\n\nSo focusing on closer apples is better because they can be collected sooner, giving me growth earlier, which is a big advantage.\n\nSo prioritizing the lower apples makes sense.\n\nSo between DOWN and LEFT. Which contributes more to collecting apples faster.\n\nSince (2,1) is 8 steps away, and (2,0) is 9. So if I can reach (2,1) in 8 moves, that's better.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,1), then next steps are LEFT to reach there. So that's 8 steps total. If I move LEFT first, then I need 7 LEFT and 1 DOWN. Also 8 steps. So same.\n\nBut maybe moving DOWN first allows me to be at (9,1), which is one step down from current, and then left. Maybe that's a better path because the apple is at (2,1), so being at (9,1) gives me a chance to collect it by moving left.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT first to (8,2) is one step towards x=2. Then next move could be LEFT again or DOWN. So perhaps moving LEFT first is better because it's a step towards the apple in x.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's moves, it's hard to say. However, since all three moves are safe, maybe the best choice is to move LEFT to start getting closer to x=2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN is better because it's a more optimal path towards the apple. Let me think of the path:\n\nOption 1: DOWN then LEFT.\n\nCurrent position: (9,2) -> DOWN to (9,1). Then LEFT to (8,1), etc. Each LEFT step reduces x.\n\nOption 2: LEFT then DOWN.\n\nCurrent position: (9,2) -> LEFT to (8,2). Then DOWN to (8,1), etc.\n\nEither way, the steps needed are similar. But maybe moving DOWN first is better because it gets me to the same y as the apple (y=1) earlier. So from (9,1), I can then move left 7 times. So that's a straight path. Whereas moving LEFT first would take me through (8,2), then maybe down.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that after moving DOWN, I can approach the apple from above or below. For example, from (9,1), moving left to x=2 would require passing through (2,1), collecting the apple. That's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I move LEFT first, I might have a more complex path. Not sure.\n\nAnother aspect: the enemy's position. If I move LEFT, am I getting closer to their x-coordinate? No, because I'm moving from x=9 to 8, while the enemy is at x=6. So distance decreases from 3 to 2. If they don't move towards me, that's okay. If they do move towards me, maybe collision could happen. But since they can move any direction, it's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN keeps my x at 9, which is further away from the enemy's x=6. So maybe less likely to collide.\n\nBut collision depends on both snakes' next positions. Since we don't know the enemy's next move, it's risky to assume.\n\nBut given that all three moves are safe, I need to choose based on progress towards apples.\n\nSince (2,1) is the closest apple, and to reach it, x needs to decrease from 9 to 2. So moving LEFT is a direct step towards that. Therefore, moving LEFT now might be better.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN doesn't help with x, but moving LEFT does. So prioritizing LEFT.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best first move here. It brings me closer to the closest apple (2,1) in terms of x-coordinate. Even though y isn't addressed yet, each move must be one direction. So starting with LEFT makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The apple at (2,1) is 7 left and 1 down. So from (9,2), moving LEFT first reduces x by 1. Then next move could be DOWN to (8,1), which is one step towards y=1. Then continue LEFT.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (9,1), then LEFT 7 times. Either way, same steps. But maybe starting with LEFT is better because it's immediately reducing x.\n\nAnother angle: if I move LEFT, each subsequent LEFT move brings me closer. If I can keep moving LEFT, I can get to x=2 quickly. But if there's a wall, no. Since the board is 10x10, x can go to 0. So moving LEFT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trap if I keep moving LEFT. But with no body, I can't hit myself.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems safe and progress-towards-apple.\n\nSo final decision: LEFT.\nLEFT",

Let me start by looking at the board layout provided.\n\nThe board is a 10x10 grid. From the board state description:\n\nLooking at the rows from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom):\n\n- At x=4, y=9 is an apple (4,9)\n- (1,9) and (1,3) also have apples. Then (2,1) and (2,0) are apples. Wait, no, maybe I need to parse that again. The apples are listed as (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). So these are the coordinates of apples on the board.\n\nMy snake's head is at (6,2). My goal is to move in a direction that doesn't kill me and gets me closer to apples. Also, I need to consider what the enemy snake is doing. The enemy snake's head is at (6,5). Since all snakes move simultaneously, we need to avoid collisions with both our own and enemy bodies.\n\nFirst, let's check possible moves from (6,2):\n\nPossible directions: UP (to (6,3)), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2).\n\nLet's evaluate each direction for safety.\n\n1. UP (6,3): Check if this cell is safe. The enemy snake's head is at (6,5). When moving, the enemy will choose a direction. But we don't know their move yet. However, we have to assume that the enemy might move into our head or our body. Wait, but according to the rules, if the enemy's head moves into any part of my body, they die. So I need to avoid moving into their possible positions.\n\nBut since we don't control the enemy's moves, we have to consider possible moves they could make. However, in the problem statement, maybe we should treat the enemy's next move as unknown. So we have to make sure that our move doesn't put us into a position where the enemy can collide with us in their next move.\n\nWait, but in the next step, all snakes move. So after moving, our head will be at (6,3) if we choose UP. Then, the enemy snake will move in some direction. If the enemy moves UP, their head would go to (6,6), which is away from us. If they move DOWN, (6,4), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5). None of these would collide with our new head unless their move brings them to (6,3). But that's possible only if the enemy chooses to move into us. However, since the enemy's choice is unknown, we can't assume they will. But perhaps in the current state, we can check if moving in a direction might lead to a collision in the immediate next step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to check if the next position (after moving) is safe from other snakes' possible heads. For example, if after moving to (6,3), the enemy's head could move into that cell. Since the enemy is currently at (6,5), if they move DOWN once, they would be at (6,4), then next turn they could move DOWN again to (6,3). But that's two turns away. Hmm, but in the current turn, after we move, the enemy moves. So if we move UP to (6,3), and the enemy moves DOWN from (6,5) to (6,4), their head is at (6,4). Then, in the next turn, if they move again, but we need to consider the current move's safety.\n\nWait, the collision happens if during the same turn, the enemy's head moves into our body. Wait, no. The rules say: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\" So during the same turn, when all snakes move, if any enemy's head moves into any part of our body (including our head), they die. So we need to check if moving to a certain position could result in the enemy's head moving into our body (including our head) in the same turn.\n\nBut since we don't control the enemy's direction, we have to assume that they might choose a direction that would cause a collision. However, perhaps the enemy is controlled by another AI, and we can't predict their moves. Therefore, maybe the safest approach is to avoid positions where the enemy could potentially collide with us in their next move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the enemy's next move is unknown, so we have to make our move such that regardless of the enemy's move, we don't die. But that might be too restrictive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enemy's movement is not an immediate threat in this turn. Let's check the current positions.\n\nEnemy's head is at (6,5). My head is at (6,2). The distance between them is 3 cells vertically. If I move UP to (6,3), then the enemy could move DOWN to (6,4), which is still two cells away from me. If the enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, they move horizontally. So in the current turn, moving UP to (6,3) would not result in a collision unless the enemy moves to (6,3) in their move. But since they are at (6,5), moving DOWN once would take them to (6,4), which is still one cell away from my new head. So unless the enemy moves UP once (but they are at 6,5; moving UP would be (6,6)), which is away. So maybe moving UP is safe in terms of immediate collision.\n\nWait, but the enemy's head is at (6,5). If they choose to move DOWN, their head would go to (6,4). If I move UP to (6,3), then after both moves, the enemy's head is at (6,4) and mine at (6,3). No collision. If the enemy moves in any other direction, their head is not at (6,3). So moving UP seems safe in terms of enemy collision.\n\nNext, check if moving UP would hit my own body. My body is empty (since body is none). So moving to (6,3) is safe for that.\n\nWhat about moving DOWN to (6,1)? That's towards lower y. The apples at (2,0) and (2,1) are in the bottom left. But moving DOWN would take me to (6,1), which is safe. However, maybe there's an apple nearby. Let's check apples. The apples at (2,0) and (2,1) are in the lower left. To reach those, moving DOWN might not be the best direction. But maybe there's an apple nearby in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,2) or RIGHT to (7,2). Let's check those positions.\n\nFor LEFT (5,2): Check if that's safe. The enemy is at (6,5), so moving LEFT to (5,2) is two cells away. The enemy's possible moves could be towards me. For example, if the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), then next turn they might approach. But again, not immediately dangerous. Also, check if (5,2) is part of any snake's body. My own body is empty. So (5,2) is safe.\n\nRIGHT (7,2) is also safe. No apples nearby here.\n\nNow, looking at the apples. The apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). My current position is (6,2). The closest apple might be (2,1) or (2,0), but they are on the left side. Alternatively, (1,3) is at x=1, y=3. That's a bit to the left and up from my current position. Wait, my head is at y=2. (1,3) is y=3, which is one cell up from y=2, but x=1 is two cells left. So to reach that apple, maybe moving LEFT and UP. But the immediate move would need to be a direction that brings me closer.\n\nAlternatively, (4,9) is up high. If I can get there, but that's a long way. The apple at (1,9) is even higher up. Maybe the closest apple is (1,3) or (2,1). Let's see.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,2), then next move could be LEFT again to (4,2), then UP to (4,3), etc., towards (1,3). But that's multiple steps. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,3) would be moving towards (1,3)? Not directly. Maybe (1,3) is at x=1, y=3. So from (6,2), moving LEFT and UP would be needed.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,1) is at x=2, y=1. That's two cells left and one cell down from my current position. So if I move LEFT and DOWN, but that would take two moves. But in one move, I can only go one direction.\n\nSo perhaps the best immediate apple to target is (2,1) or (1,3). Let's see.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,2), then next turn I can move LEFT again to (4,2), then LEFT again to (3,2), etc., but that's not efficient. Alternatively, moving UP to (6,3) might be a step towards (1,3) if I can then move LEFT multiple times. But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,0) or (2,1) is closer. Let's calculate distances.\n\nDistance to (2,1): Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |2-1| = 4 +1=5.\n\nDistance to (1,3): |6-1| + |2-3| =5 +1=6.\n\nDistance to (2,0): |6-2| + |2-0|=4+2=6.\n\nSo (2,1) is the closest. So moving towards that would be better. But how?\n\nTo get to (2,1) from (6,2), I need to move left 4 times and down once. But each move is one direction. So the path would require moving left each time, but maybe there are obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (2,1) is in a position that I can reach by moving LEFT and then DOWN. But in one move, I can only choose one direction. So if I move LEFT now, next turn I can move DOWN. But I need to check if that path is safe.\n\nBut in the current turn, the best move would be to move towards the closest apple while ensuring safety.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (5,2) is better because it's one step towards (2,1). But is that cell safe?\n\nThe enemy's head is at (6,5). If I move LEFT to (5,2), the enemy could move in any direction. For example, if the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), then in the next turn, they might be moving towards me. But in the current turn, after moving, the enemy's head would be wherever they choose. But we can't predict that. So the immediate safety is the key.\n\nSo for each possible move, check if the new head position is safe (not off the board, not into own body, not into enemy's body, not into enemy's head in the same turn).\n\nWait, the rules say:\n\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\n\nSo when considering my move, I need to check that my new head position is not:\n\n1. Off the board.\n\n2. On my own body (but my body is empty now, so that's not an issue).\n\n3. On the enemy's body (the enemy's body is none, as per the enemy description: Body: none). So enemy's body is empty. So moving into enemy's head position would be a collision if the enemy moves into me? Wait, no. The enemy's head is at (6,5). If I move to (5,2), the enemy's head is at (6,5). So unless the enemy moves their head into my new position, which is (5,2), that would be a collision. But since the enemy is moving at the same time, if they choose to move to (5,2), that would cause a collision and both would die. But since we don't control the enemy, we can't assume they will do that. However, we have to make sure that our move doesn't put us into a position where the enemy could collide with us in their move. Wait, no. The collision happens if during the same turn, the enemy's head moves into any part of our body (including our head). But in this case, if I move to (5,2), and the enemy moves to (5,2), then their head would be in my head's new position. That would result in both our deaths (since two heads collide). But if the enemy doesn't choose to move there, then no problem. So we can't assume the enemy will collide with us, but we have to avoid moving into positions where the enemy could possibly move into us. However, since the enemy's move is unknown, perhaps we have to consider that they might. But that's a bit of a dilemma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest approach is to avoid positions where the enemy could reach in their next move. For example, if I move to (5,2), the enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT once, they would be at (5,5). Then, in the next turn, they could move DOWN to (5,4), etc. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to prioritize moves that don't put us in a position where the enemy can reach us in the next turn. For example, if I move UP to (6,3), then the enemy's head is at (6,5). If they move DOWN twice, they could reach (6,3) in two moves. But in the next turn, after I move, they will move once. So if I am at (6,3), and the enemy moves DOWN from (6,5) to (6,4), then no collision. But if they move DOWN again in the next turn, that's a different situation.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the key is to make sure that our current move doesn't result in a collision in this turn. Let's re-express the rules for safety:\n\nMy new head position must not be:\n\n- Off the board (so between 0-9 for x and y).\n\n- On my own body (but body is empty).\n\n- On the enemy's head or body. Wait, no. The rules say:\n\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So the enemy's body is none, so that's not a problem. But if the enemy's head moves into my body (including my head), then I would die? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So when I move, if my new head is in any snake's body (including my own), I die. So the enemy's body is none, so that's not a problem. But the enemy's head is at (6,5). So if I move into (6,5), that would be the enemy's head. But since the enemy is moving at the same time, if I move to (6,5) and the enemy moves away, that's okay. But if the enemy stays at (6,5) (if they don't move), then I would collide. But do snakes have to move each turn? Or can they choose not to move? The rules say \"each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" So each snake must choose a direction to move. So the enemy will have to move, so their head will change from (6,5) to somewhere else. So moving into (6,5) would only be possible if the enemy's head is there when I move. But since they are moving, their head will be elsewhere. Wait, no. Because all moves happen simultaneously. So when I choose to move to (6,5), the enemy will also move. So if the enemy chooses to move, say, LEFT to (5,5), then my new head is at (6,5), and their new head is at (5,5). So no collision. But if the enemy chooses to stay in place? No, they have to move. So in this case, moving to (6,5) would be possible only if the enemy's move takes them to (6,5). But since they have to move, their head can't stay. So my move to (6,5) is safe from collision with the enemy's head, because the enemy's head will move somewhere else.\n\nWait, no. Because during the same turn, all snakes move. So if I move my head to (6,5), and the enemy moves their head to (6,5), then both heads collide, and both die. But since the enemy is at (6,5) now, if they choose to move in a direction that keeps them there, but they have to move. So the enemy must choose a direction. So their head will leave (6,5). Therefore, moving to (6,5) would not result in a collision with the enemy's head, because the enemy's head will be elsewhere. Unless the enemy's move brings them back to (6,5), which is impossible because they have to move. So moving to (6,5) is safe in terms of enemy collision in this turn.\n\nBut wait, the enemy's head is at (6,5). If I move to (6,5), then during the same turn, the enemy must move. So their head will leave (6,5). So my new head is at (6,5), but the enemy's head is moving to another position. So no collision. So that's safe. However, if the enemy moves in a direction that brings them to (6,5) again? No, because they have to move. For example, if the enemy is at (6,5) and moves DOWN to (6,4), then my head is at (6,5). So no collision. So moving to (6,5) is safe in that case.\n\nBut wait, the enemy's head is at (6,5). If I move to (6,5), and the enemy moves, say, LEFT to (5,5), then my head is at (6,5) and their head is at (5,5). No collision. So that's safe. So moving to (6,5) is possible. But is that a good idea? Because (6,5) is where the enemy is now. But since they have to move, they can't stay. So maybe moving to (6,5) is possible, but perhaps not useful. However, in this case, the enemy's head is at (6,5), which is one cell above my current head. So if I move UP to (6,3), I'm moving away. Alternatively, moving LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nBut let's check each direction:\n\n1. UP: (6,3). Check if this is safe.\n\n- Not off the board.\n\n- Not on my body (no body).\n\n- Enemy's body is none, so no collision with enemy's body. But could the enemy's head move into (6,3) in this turn? The enemy is at (6,5). To reach (6,3), they would need to move DOWN twice. But in one turn, they can only move once. So the enemy's head would be at (6,4) if they move DOWN. So (6,3) is safe from enemy's head in this turn. So moving UP is safe.\n\n2. DOWN: (6,1). Check safety.\n\n- Not off the board.\n\n- No body.\n\n- Enemy's head is at (6,5). To reach (6,1), they would need to move DOWN four times. Not possible in one move. So safe.\n\n3. LEFT: (5,2). Check.\n\n- Safe.\n\n4. RIGHT: (7,2). Safe.\n\nSo all four directions are safe in terms of immediate collision. So all four moves are possible. Now, the next step is to choose the best among these.\n\nNow, considering apples. The closest apple is (2,1) at a Manhattan distance of 5. The next closest is (1,3) at 6. Then (2,0) at 6. The others are higher up. So ideally, moving towards (2,1) would be better. How can I get there?\n\nFrom (6,2), moving LEFT each time would reduce x-coordinate. So moving LEFT to (5,2), then LEFT again to (4,2), etc. But each move is one step. So in one move, moving LEFT gets me closer to (2,1). So that's a good direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,1) is also towards the apples at (2,1) and (2,0). But that's a vertical move. Let's see.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,2), then next turn I can move LEFT again to (4,2), then LEFT to (3,2), etc. But each step is one move. So (5,2) is closer to (2,1) than (6,2). So moving LEFT is a step in the right direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,1) would bring me closer to (2,1) in terms of y-coordinate. But x is still 6. So from (6,1), moving LEFT multiple times would be needed. But maybe moving LEFT is better.\n\nBut also, need to consider if moving LEFT is a good direction in terms of avoiding being trapped. Let's see the current position. The head is at (6,2). Moving LEFT to (5,2) would be towards the left side. There are apples at (2,1) and (2,0), which are on the left side. So moving LEFT seems beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (6,3) would take me away from the apples but maybe towards (1,3). But (1,3) is at x=1, y=3. So from (6,3), moving LEFT five times would get there. But that's a longer path. However, maybe there's an apple at (1,3), which is one cell up from (1,2). Not sure.\n\nAnother consideration is whether moving in a certain direction would block future moves. For example, if I move LEFT, then the next move could be LEFT again, but if there's a wall or enemy, that could be a problem. But in this case, the board seems open.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the enemy's position. If I move LEFT to (5,2), the enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5), then their head is at (5,5). Then, in the next turn, if I move LEFT to (4,2), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,4), that's okay. But maybe the enemy could choose to move in a way that approaches me. However, since we can't predict their moves, perhaps the best we can do is to move towards the apples while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\nAnother point: the rule says to prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available. So after moving, I should have as many possible directions next turn as possible. For example, moving UP to (6,3) would allow me to go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn. Similarly, moving LEFT to (5,2) allows me to go in any direction. So all four directions seem to have similar flexibility, unless moving into a position that's adjacent to walls or other snakes.\n\nBut in this case, all directions are open. So perhaps the best move is to go LEFT towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple in the direction of moving LEFT. For example, (2,1) is at x=2, y=1. So moving LEFT would be towards that. But how far is that? From (6,2) to (2,1) is 4 steps left and 1 step down. So moving LEFT now is a step towards that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an apple at (2,1) which is two cells left and one cell down. So if I move LEFT, then next turn I can move DOWN. But in the current turn, moving LEFT is a step towards that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving DOWN to (6,1) is also a step towards (2,1) in terms of y-coordinate. But x is still 6. So moving LEFT is better for x.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, LEFT seems better for getting closer to (2,1).\n\nAnother consideration: moving UP could be towards (1,3), but that's further away. Let's see. (1,3) is x=1, y=3. From (6,3), moving LEFT five times would get there, but that's a long way. So maybe not the best immediate target.\n\nThe apple at (4,9) is way up high. Not sure how to reach that quickly.\n\nSo the apples at (2,1) and (2,0) are the closest. So moving LEFT or DOWN could help.\n\nBut which direction is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,2), next turn I can move LEFT again to (4,2), then LEFT to (3,2), etc. Alternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,1), then next turn I can move LEFT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0), but that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT allows me to get closer to (2,1) in x, while moving DOWN gets me closer in y. Since (2,1) is x=2, y=1, moving LEFT is more critical for x. So moving LEFT is better.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (2,1) is at (2,1). If I can reach that, I can collect it. But to get there, I need to move LEFT four times and DOWN once. But each move is a turn. So in four moves, I could get there, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nBut in the current turn, moving LEFT is a step towards that.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy's position. If I move LEFT to (5,2), and the enemy moves in some direction. For example, if the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), then in the next turn, they might be closer. But I can't predict that. However, as long as my move is safe, it's acceptable.\n\nSo between the four possible moves, LEFT seems to be the best because it moves me closer to the nearest apple (2,1). The other directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) don't directly contribute to reaching an apple as effectively.\n\nWait, but what about the apple at (1,3)? If I move UP to (6,3), then next turn I can move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT again to (4,3), etc. But that's a longer path. However, (1,3) is an apple. So maybe combining UP and LEFT moves could reach that. But again, it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (4,9) is worth pursuing if I can get there. But that's very far. Probably not in the immediate future.\n\nSo the best immediate apple to target is (2,1). Therefore, moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nBut wait, let's check if moving LEFT is possible. The current head is at (6,2). Moving LEFT to (5,2). Is there any snake's body there? My own body is empty. The enemy's body is none. So (5,2) is safe.\n\nAnother thing to check: moving LEFT would not result in a collision with the enemy's head. The enemy is at (6,5). After moving LEFT, my head is at (5,2). The enemy's head will move somewhere else. So no collision.\n\nSo moving LEFT is a safe move and brings me closer to the closest apple. Therefore, the best move is LEFT.\nLEFT",

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) in this game. The board is 10x10, and right now, the head is at (4,2). The apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (6,5).\n\nFirst, I should check what moves are safe. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's evaluate each.\n\nStarting with UP. Moving up would take the head from (4,2) to (4,3). Let me check if that's safe. The body is none, so no issue with own body. Also, check if any enemy snake is body or head in that spot. Enemy's head is at (6,5), body none. So (4,3) is safe. So UP is possible.\n\nDOWN would move to (4,1). Check if that's safe. Again, no own body there. Enemy is at (6,5), so no. So DOWN is safe.\n\nLEFT would take me to (3,2). Safe? No obstacles there. So safe.\n\nRIGHT would be (5,2). Safe as well.\n\nSo all four directions are initially possible. But need to consider future moves and avoiding collisions with enemies.\n\nNext, the apples. The closest apples are at (2,1) and (2,0). Wait, the head is at (4,2). The apple at (2,1) is two steps left and one down. The apple at (2,0) is two left and two down. The apple at (1,3) is three left and one up. The apple at (4,9) is straight up 7 steps. The one at (1,9) is far away.\n\nSo maybe moving towards the closer apples would be better. Let's see. If I move LEFT once, I get to (3,2). Then next move could move LEFT again to (2,2), then DOWN to (2,1) to get that apple. Alternatively, moving DOWN would take me towards (2,0) or (2,1) more directly. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP towards (4,3) might be a longer path to (4,9) apple, but that's 6 steps up. Maybe not the best. But maybe there's a way to avoid the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,5). If they move in any direction, their head will be somewhere else. But since all snakes move simultaneously, if I move into a position that the enemy could move into, that could be a collision. Wait, the rules say that if another snake's head moves into any part of my body, that snake dies. So if the enemy's head moves into my body, they die, which is good. But if I move into their body, I die. So I need to avoid their body.\n\nBut the enemy's body is none, so only their head is at (6,5). So unless I move into (6,5), which I can't because I'm at (4,2), my movements are safe from them. Unless they move into my head. So if I move into a position that the enemy could move into next turn, but that's for the next turn.\n\nBut for this turn, the immediate safety is okay. So maybe the next step is to move towards the closest apples. The apple at (2,1) is two left and one down. So moving LEFT then DOWN could get there in two steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,1), then LEFT twice. But the path needs to be clear.\n\nLooking at the board state. The board is shown as:\n\nRow 9: . A . . A . . . . .\nRow 8: all dots\nRow 7: all dots\nRow 6: . . . . . . 0 . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . A . . . . . . . .\nRow 2: . . . . 1 . . . . .\nRow 1: . . A . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nSo the apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). The enemies are at (6,5). So the apple at (2,1) is two left and one down from my head. The apple at (2,0) is two left and two down. The apple at (1,3) is three left and one up. So moving LEFT once would get me closer to (2,1) and (1,3). Let me check if moving LEFT is safe.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2). LEFT would be (3,2). Is there any snake body there? No, since my body is none. Enemy's head is at (6,5), so no. So LEFT is safe. So moving LEFT is a valid first step. Then next turn, from (3,2), moving LEFT again to (2,2), then DOWN to (2,1) to get the apple. But I need to make sure that in each step, the path is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,1) would get me closer to (2,0) or (2,1). But (4,1) is two steps left and one down from (2,1). Hmm. Maybe moving LEFT is better first.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy's movement. Since they are at (6,5), if I can avoid their path. But since they can move in any direction, it's hard to predict. However, if I can get into a position where the enemy's head could collide with my body, that would be good. But again, that's for future turns.\n\nThe priority now is to eat apples. Since I have zero apples, getting the first one is crucial. The closest apple is (2,1), which is two left and one down. So moving LEFT first. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nYes, as before. So moving LEFT to (3,2). Then next move, LEFT again to (2,2), then DOWN to (2,1). But each step needs to be safe. Let's see if moving LEFT now is the best first step.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,1). Then from there, moving LEFT twice or DOWN again. But (4,1) is two steps away from (2,1) (LEFT twice and DOWN once?), no. Wait, (4,1) to (2,1) is two LEFT steps. So from (4,1), moving LEFT twice would reach (2,1). But that's two steps. Alternatively, from (4,2), moving LEFT once to (3,2), then DOWN to (3,1), then LEFT to (2,1). That's three steps. Hmm. Maybe moving LEFT first is better.\n\nAnother thing: after moving LEFT to (3,2), the next move could be DOWN to (3,1), then LEFT to (2,1). But need to check if those cells are safe. Let's check the board. The apple at (2,1) is present, but the path to it must not have any obstacles. The board shows that (2,1) is an apple, but the cells around it? For example, (3,1) is not an apple, but is it blocked? The board shows row 3: . A . . . . . . . . So (3,3) is an apple? Wait, (1,3) is an apple. Wait, the apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (2,1), (2,0). So (1,3) is an apple. So (3,3) is not an apple. So (3,1) is empty. So moving there is possible.\n\nBut the enemy's position is (6,5). So if they move in any direction, but unless they are moving towards my path, it's not a problem. For now, the immediate step is to move LEFT, which is safe. Then plan the next steps.\n\nAnother thing to consider: moving LEFT might not be the only option. But since the apple is closer in that direction, it's better to go towards it. Also, moving LEFT would keep the option to go DOWN or LEFT again. So the first move should be LEFT. Then next moves can be planned accordingly.\n\nSo the best initial move here is LEFT. That's the direction to take now.\nLEFT",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this multi-apple game. The goal is to collect apples without dying, and ideally get to 30 apples first. Let's start by analyzing the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake's current position is head at (1,1), body at (1,0) and (2,0). The apples collected so far are 2. The apples on the board are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (5,8), (3,9). The enemy snake is at (8,7) with no body. \n\nThe last move was UP, which probably brought the head up from (1,0) to (1,1). Wait, no, the head was at (1,1) now. Wait, the coordinates are Y from bottom (0) to top (9). So moving UP increases Y. So from (1,0), moving up would take the head to (1,1), which is where it is now. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the next move. Let's consider the possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check each direction for immediate dangers.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,1). Body is [(1,0), (2,0)]. So the cells occupied by my snake are (1,1), (1,0), (2,0).\n\nCheck each direction:\n\nUP: (1,2). Is that a problem? Let's see. Is (1,2) out of bounds? No. Is it in my body? No. Is it in the enemy's body? The enemy has no body. So moving up would be safe. But what about the enemy's head moving? The enemy is at (8,7). They might move in some direction. But since we don't know their move yet, we have to assume they could be moving in any direction. However, the problem says that all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move up, and the enemy moves in a way that their head ends up at (1,2), that would kill me. But since we can't predict their move, maybe we have to assume they might not. However, in the decision process, step 2 says to eliminate moves that would immediately kill. But since the enemy's move is unknown, perhaps we can't consider that as an immediate kill. Unless there's a guaranteed collision. But since the enemy's direction isn't known, maybe we can't eliminate that. So maybe UP is safe for now.\n\nDOWN: (1,0). That's already my body. So moving down would put the head into (1,0), which is part of my own body. That's a kill. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (0,1). Check if that's on the board. Yes. Is it in my body? No. Is it in enemy's body? No. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT: (2,1). Check if that's in my body. My body is (1,0) and (2,0). So (2,1) is not. So RIGHT is possible.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is eliminated.\n\nNow, step 3: among these, favor moves that increase chance of eating apples and keep future options open.\n\nLooking at the apples available:\n\nThe apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (1,3), (5,8), (3,9). So the closest one to me is (1,3) which is at Y=3, X=1. That's three units up from my current head (Y=1 to Y=3). To reach that apple, I need to move up. Alternatively, (1,9) is higher up. But maybe (1,9) is in the same column but higher Y. Let's see.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), then next moves could continue up towards (1,3). Alternatively, moving RIGHT or LEFT might take me away from that apple. Let's think about the apples nearby.\n\n(1,3) is directly above me. So moving UP towards that would be good. But I need to check if moving up is safe. If I go up, next turn I could continue up. But also, the enemy is at (8,7). If they move towards me, maybe they could collide. But since they are far away, maybe not a problem. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,1) might take me towards (5,8) or (3,9), but those are further. Similarly, LEFT to (0,1) is away from the apples. So the best bet might be to move UP towards the (1,3) apple. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (1,3) is three steps up. So moving up once would get me to (1,2), then next turn up again to (1,3) to collect the apple. That would be ideal. But I need to make sure that moving up is safe. \n\nAlternatively, considering the enemy's position. The enemy is at (8,7). If they move down or left, they might come closer. But since they can move in any direction, we can't be sure. However, the problem says that in step 2, we should eliminate moves that would immediately kill. Since the enemy's move is simultaneous, but we don't know their direction, perhaps we can't eliminate UP based on them. Unless there's a guaranteed collision. But since they are at (8,7), moving towards me would require moving left and up/down. But unless they are moving directly towards me, which is (1,1), that's 7 units left and 6 units down. That's a lot. So maybe it's unlikely. \n\nSo the main thing is to avoid immediate death. So UP is safe. So moving UP towards the (1,3) apple seems the best. \n\nBut wait, the last move was UP. So moving UP again would be moving from (1,1) to (1,2). Then next turn, moving up again would get to (1,3) to collect that apple. That seems good. \n\nBut what about the move RIGHT? If I move right to (2,1), then maybe I can go towards (5,8) or (3,9). But those are further away. However, maybe there's a path. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (0,1) might not be helpful. \n\nAnother consideration: the apples collected so far are 2. The goal is to get to 30. So we need to collect as many apples as possible. The next closest apple is (1,3), which is three steps up. Collecting that would be good. \n\nBut also, the apple at (1,9) is higher. But that's 8 units up. So maybe not as immediate. \n\nAnother point: when moving, we need to avoid getting trapped. For example, if we move right, maybe the path is open. But with the current body, moving right to (2,1) would have the body follow. The next body parts would be (1,1) (current head) and (2,0). So after moving right, the new body would be (1,1) and (2,1). So the path is open. \n\nBut moving up would take me towards the (1,3) apple. \n\nSo between UP, LEFT, RIGHT, which is best? \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (1,9) is in the same column. So if I can get up there, that's another apple. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,8) is to the right and up. \n\nBut given that (1,3) is the closest, moving up makes sense. \n\nSo the best move is UP. \n\nBut wait, let me check if moving up would allow for multiple future moves. For example, after moving up to (1,2), next moves could be up again to (1,3) to get the apple. That's two moves. Then, after that, maybe continue towards other apples. \n\nAlternatively, if I move right, maybe I can go towards (5,8) or (3,9). But those are further. \n\nAnother thing: the apple at (3,9) is to the right and up. If I move right to (2,1), then next moves could be up or right. \n\nBut considering that the immediate apple is (1,3), which is just three steps up, moving up seems the most efficient. \n\nSo the decision is to move UP. \n\nBut wait, what about the move LEFT? If I move left to (0,1), that's a new direction. But that's away from the apples. Unless there's a reason to go left. But I don't see any apples in that direction. \n\nSo the best options are UP or RIGHT. \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (8,7). If I move right, maybe I can stay away from them. But since they are moving simultaneously, their movement could affect. But again, we can't predict. \n\nBut the main priority is to collect apples. So moving towards (1,3) is better. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be UP.\nUP",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide the next move for my snake. Let's start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake is at (1,3) as the head, with body parts at (1,2), (1,1), and (1,0). The apples collected are 3. The board has apples at several positions, but the closest ones might be important. The enemy snake is at (9,6) with no body, so they might move towards me or maybe just stay still.\n\nThe last move was UP, which makes sense because the head is at (1,3), moving up would take it to (1,4). Wait, but looking at the board, the 1st row (y=0) is all 'T's for my body. The Y-axis increases upwards, so y=9 is the top. So my current head is at (1,3). Moving up would take me to (1,4), which is below the apple at (3,9) and others. Wait, no, (3,9) is in the top row (y=9), which is way up. So my next move needs to plan towards collecting apples but also avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, check all possible moves for safety. The last move was UP, so the current head is at (1,3). The next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each direction:\n\nUP: (1,3) + UP -> (1,4). Is this a safe move? Check if it's within bounds (yes, since y=4 is between 0 and 9). Then check if it's in my own body. The current body is [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0)], so (1,4) is not in there. Also, check if any enemy's head or body will be there. The enemy's head is at (9,6), so unless they move to (1,4), which is unlikely. So UP seems safe.\n\nWait, but when moving, all snakes move at the same time. So the enemy snake's next position depends on their move. But since I don't know their next move, I have to assume they might move in any direction. So I need to make sure that after moving, my head doesn't collide with any of the enemy's possible positions. But since I can't predict their move, maybe the safest assumption is that they might move towards me. However, the enemy's current head is at (9,6), which is far from my current position. So unless they decide to move towards me, their head won't collide with me. But since they have no body, they might be in a different path.\n\nBut for safety, when considering movement, I should check possible collisions with enemy's current head and body. However, since the enemy's body is none (they have no body segments), only their head's position matters. So during the next turn, the enemy's head could be in any of the four directions from (9,6), but without knowing their move, it's hard to predict. However, the rules state that if another snake's head moves into my body, that snake dies. But since the enemy has no body, my head moving into their head would be a collision if they move there. But since they are not moving into my body unless they choose to. So the main danger is if during my movement, my head ends up where the enemy's head is moving to. But since I can't predict their move, maybe I should avoid positions where the enemy's head could possibly move into. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy's current head is at (9,6), and they have no body, their next move could be any direction. So my head moving to (1,4) is safe unless the enemy moves there. But since (1,4) is far from (9,6), even if the enemy moves down, left, right, or up, they can't reach (1,4) in one move. So (9,6) to (1,4) would require moving 8 steps left and 2 up, which is impossible in one move. Therefore, moving UP to (1,4) is safe in terms of enemy collision.\n\nNext, DOWN: (1,3) -> (1,2). But (1,2) is part of my own body. That's invalid because moving into my own body (including the cell directly behind, which is the case here since the last move was UP, so the previous head was (1,3), and moving down would be into (1,2), which is the next body segment. So DOWN is invalid.\n\nLEFT: (1,3) -> (0,3). Check if that's safe. Coordinates are valid. Check if it's in my body. My body is (1,2), (1,1), (1,0). So (0,3) is not in there. Also, check enemy's possible positions. The enemy is at (9,6), so (0,3) is far away. So LEFT is safe.\n\nRIGHT: (1,3) -> (2,3). Also valid. Not in my body. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is invalid because it's into my own body.\n\nNow, among these three, which is best? The next step is to prioritize moves that allow me to collect apples and avoid future collisions.\n\nLooking at the apples: The apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (5,8), (3,9), (7,2). My current position is (1,3). The closest apple is (1,9) which is two cells up from (1,3) to (1,5), but wait, (1,9) is at x=1, y=9. So to reach (1,9), I need to move up 6 times. Alternatively, (3,9) is at x=3, y=9. (5,8) is x=5, y=8. (7,2) is further down. The apple at (4,9) is x=4, y=9.\n\nSo the closest apples are (1,9) and (3,9), but (1,9) is same x as me. So moving up towards (1,9) would be a good direction. However, moving up once to (1,4) is a step towards that. But after that, each turn I can continue moving up. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in my path. My current body is along x=1, y=0 to 3. If I keep moving up, my body will follow, so the next positions would be (1,4), (1,5), etc. But there's no apples in that column except (1,9). So moving up would take me towards (1,9), but it's 6 steps away. However, maybe there are other apples that are closer in other directions.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,2) is at x=7, y=2. That's quite far. The apple at (5,8) is x=5, y=8. The apple at (3,9) is x=3, y=9. So (3,9) is two steps right and six up. (5,8) is four steps right and five up. The apple at (4,9) is three steps right and six up.\n\nHmm. But given that moving up is possible, perhaps moving towards (1,9) is a good approach. However, I need to check if moving up is safe in terms of future moves. For example, if I move up to (1,4), then next turn I can move up again to (1,5), etc. But the problem is that the enemy might decide to move towards me. However, since the enemy is at (9,6), unless they move left or down, they might not approach me. But since they have no body, their movement is only their head. So if they decide to move left towards me, but that's a long way. So perhaps moving up is safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right or left could position me to collect other apples. For example, moving right to (2,3), then perhaps moving towards (5,8) or (4,9). But that's a longer path. However, the apples at (3,9) and (4,9) are in the top row. So maybe moving right to get closer to those?\n\nAlternatively, considering that I have 3 apples, and the game can be won by reaching 30 apples. So I need to collect 27 more. But that's a lot. However, the game might end before that. But the immediate goal is to not die and collect as many apples as possible.\n\nAnother factor is that if I can reach an apple quickly, that's better. The apple at (1,9) is 6 steps up. The apple at (3,9) is 2 right and 6 up. The apple at (5,8) is 4 right and 5 up. The apple at (7,2) is 6 right and 1 down. So the closest in terms of steps might be (7,2) if I can move right and down. But since my current position is (1,3), moving down would be into my body. So that's not possible. So perhaps moving right to (2,3) first, then down towards (7,2)? But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving left to (0,3), but that's moving away from most apples.\n\nWait, but the apple at (1,9) is in the same column. So moving up each time would get me there in 6 moves. Each move up would add a segment, so after 6 moves, I would reach (1,9) and collect that apple. That's 6 moves. But during those moves, I need to ensure that I don't collide with anyone. But since the enemy is at (9,6), unless they move towards me, which is possible but not certain. However, if I keep moving up, my body will be in the same column. The enemy's head is at (9,6), so unless they move left 8 steps, which they can't in one move, they can't collide. So moving up seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (2,3) could be better to avoid being in a straight line, but I'm not sure. Also, need to check if moving right would allow for more options. For example, moving right might allow me to go up and right towards (3,9) or (4,9). But that's a trade-off.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving up, the next move could be up again. But if I keep moving up, I might end up in a position where my body is blocking my own path. Wait, no. Because each time I move up, my body follows. So after moving up to (1,4), the body will be (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Then next move up to (1,5), body becomes (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So each time, the body is moving up. So there's no issue of blocking myself unless I reverse direction. But since I'm moving up each time, the body is following, so no collision.\n\nSo moving up seems a safe and direct path towards (1,9). However, maybe there's a better apple in a different direction. Let's see the other apples. The apple at (3,9) is two steps to the right and six up. If I move right once to (2,3), then next turn I could move right again to (3,3), then up towards (3,9). But that's two steps right and then up. Alternatively, moving right then up. But that's more steps. However, (3,9) is an apple. So maybe moving right first could be better if I can reach (3,9) faster. Let's calculate steps:\n\nFrom (1,3) to (3,9): need 2 right and 6 up. Total of 8 steps. If I move right once this turn, then next turn move right again, then up. But that's 2 rights and then 6 ups. Alternatively, moving up first. But (1,9) is 6 steps up. So moving up six times would get me there. So (1,9) is 6 steps, (3,9) is 8 steps. So (1,9) is closer. So moving up is better.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (1,9) is in the same column. So moving up each time is the fastest way to get there. So that's a good target. So the best move is UP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a risk that moving up could lead to a collision. For example, if the enemy moves into my path. But given that the enemy is at (9,6), unless they move left or down towards me, which is possible but not certain. However, since I can't predict their move, the safest approach is to assume they might move towards me. But how?\n\nIf I move up, the enemy could move left or down. If they move left, their head would be (8,6), then (7,6), etc. But unless they move down, they might not reach my path. Alternatively, if they move down, their head could be (9,5), (9,4), etc. But again, unless they move left and down towards me, which is possible but not certain. However, since I can't predict their move, perhaps the safest assumption is that they might not collide with me. Therefore, moving up is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when moving up, I need to check if the next position (1,4) is safe. As per the rules, the move is safe if after moving, my head doesn't collide with any snake's body (including my own) or another snake's head. Since my own body after moving up would be (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So (1,4) is not in that. The enemy's head is at (9,6), so unless they move to (1,4), which is unlikely, it's safe. So UP is a valid move.\n\nSo between UP, LEFT, RIGHT, which is best? The priority is to collect apples. The closest apple is (1,9), so moving UP is the best direction. Therefore, the best move is UP again. However, the last move was UP, and moving UP again would continue towards (1,9). So that's a good plan.\n\nBut wait, the apples at (3,9) and (4,9) are also in the top row. Maybe moving right could allow me to reach those apples. But that's a longer path. However, if I can reach (3,9) in fewer steps, but I think (1,9) is closer. Let me check the actual positions again.\n\nMy current head is (1,3). The apple at (1,9) is 6 units up. The apple at (3,9) is 2 right and 6 up. So to reach (3,9), I need to move right twice and up six times. That's 8 moves. Whereas (1,9) is 6 moves. So moving up is better.\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP. However, I need to check if there are any other considerations. For example, if moving up would lead to a situation where I have no safe moves in the future. But since the board is 10x10, and I'm moving up, there's plenty of space. Unless the enemy's head is moving towards me. But again, without knowing their move, it's hard to say. But given the current information, UP seems safe and the best direction towards an apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT or RIGHT could avoid a potential future collision. For example, if the enemy is going to move left, but that's a stretch. Since the enemy is at (9,6), moving left would take them towards (8,6), (7,6), etc. But unless they decide to move towards me, which is possible but not certain. However, since I can't predict their move, it's better to focus on my own safety and apple collection.\n\nAnother point: the rules mention that if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies. So if the enemy moves into my body, they die. But since my body is along x=1, y=0 to 3, and the enemy is at (9,6), they would have to move left 8 steps and down 6 steps to reach my body. That's impossible in one move. So the enemy's head can't reach my body in one move. Therefore, the only collision risk is if my head moves into their head's new position. But since they are at (9,6), their possible next positions are (9\u00b11,6\u00b11) or same. So (1,4) is 8 left and 2 up from (9,6). So even if the enemy moves left 8 steps, which they can't in one move, they can't reach (1,4). Therefore, moving UP is safe.\n\nThus, the best move is UP. But wait, the last move was UP. So moving UP again would be continuing in the same direction. That's fine. So the next move should be UP.\nUP",

The body is along (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). The apples are at (4,9), (1,9), (5,8), (3,9), (7,2). The enemy is at (9,5) with no body.\n\nFirst, check possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But need to eliminate unsafe moves.\n\nDOWN would take the head to (1,3), which is part of the body. That's invalid because moving into your own body. So DOWN is out.\n\nUP takes the head to (1,5). Check if that's safe. The body after moving would be [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. So (1,5) isn't in the body. Also, check enemy's possible positions. The enemy is at (9,5). If they move left, they could be at (8,5), but (1,5) is way off. So UP seems safe.\n\nLEFT to (0,4). Check safety. The body would be [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]. (0,4) is not in there. Enemy is at (9,5), so (0,4) is safe. So LEFT is possible.\n\nRIGHT to (2,4). Similarly, check body and enemy. Safe.\n\nSo possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which is best? The goal is to collect apples. The closest apple is (1,9) which is 5 cells up from current (1,4). Moving UP towards that makes sense. Also, the apple at (3,9) is 2 right and 5 up. But moving UP directly is better for (1,9). \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT could get closer to (3,9) or (4,9), but that's a longer path. However, moving UP is more direct for (1,9). Also, considering the enemy's position, moving UP doesn't put the head near the enemy. The enemy is at (9,5), so unless they move left a lot, which they can't in one turn, there's no collision risk.\n\nAnother thing: moving UP again would continue towards (1,9). Each UP move gets closer. So the best move is UP.\nUP",
