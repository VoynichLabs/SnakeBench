This takes me closer to the apple at (7, 3). No collision risk.\n\n2. **DOWN** (6, 1): This would put me exactly where the enemy snake's head is currently. Since we move simultaneously, if the enemy moves away, I'd be fine. But if the enemy stays or we both end up at (6, 1), we'd collide. The enemy might move DOWN to get the apple at (6, 0). This is risky for a head-on collision.\n\n3. **LEFT** (5, 2): Safe move. Keeps options open but doesn't move toward any nearby apple directly.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (7, 2): Safe move. This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3).\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 3) - just one right and one up from my position.\n\nThe enemy at (6, 1) is likely going to move DOWN to (6, 0) to grab that apple, since it's right below them.\n\nBest moves analysis:\n- **UP** to (6, 3): Gets me one step closer to apple at (7, 3). Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (7, 2): Also gets me one step closer to apple at (7, 3). Safe.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are good. If I go RIGHT first, then UP next turn, I reach (7, 3) and get the apple. If I go UP first, then RIGHT, same result.\n\nGoing UP keeps me vertically aligned, and the enemy is likely going down for (6, 0). Going RIGHT now seems slightly better as it separates me horizontally from the enemy's column.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. Get to (7, 3) for the apple - can do RIGHT then UP\n2. After that, consider (5, 7) or (8, 9)\n3. Watch enemy movements to avoid head-on collisions\n\nI'll go RIGHT to (7, 2), then UP next turn to grab the apple at (7, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

No obstacles. Gets me closer to (8, 9) apple.\n\n2. **DOWN** (5, 6): Safe move. No obstacles there. Gets me closer to (3, 5) apple.\n\n3. **LEFT** (4, 7): Safe move. No obstacles.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (6, 7): This is where my body is! Moving into my own body = death. ELIMINATE.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated - that's my body.\n\nHead collision check:\n- Enemy head is at (3, 2)\n- From (3, 2), enemy can move to: (3, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2)\n- None of these are anywhere near my potential positions (5, 8), (5, 6), or (4, 7). No collision risk.\n\nLet me think about which direction is best among UP, DOWN, LEFT:\n\nApple locations and distances from (5, 7):\n- (0, 0): 5 left + 7 down = 12 moves (far away, in enemy territory)\n- (6, 0): 1 right + 7 down = 8 moves (but right is blocked by my body for now)\n- (8, 9): 3 right + 2 up = 5 moves (good target!)\n- (9, 7): 4 right = 4 moves (good target, same row!)\n- (3, 5): 2 left + 2 down = 4 moves (decent target)\n\nMy body is at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), so to go right I need to wait for my tail to clear or go around.\n\nLet me think about paths:\n- To reach (9, 7) or (8, 9), I need to eventually go right. But (6, 7) is blocked. I could:\n  - Go UP first, then right\n  - Go around some other way\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 8):\n- Next turn I can go: UP to (5, 9), LEFT to (4, 8), or RIGHT to (6, 8) - all safe\n- From (5, 8), I can reach (8, 9) in 3 right + 1 up = 4 moves\n- Good path!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6):\n- Getting closer to (3, 5) apple\n- From (5, 6), I could go LEFT, LEFT, DOWN to reach (3, 5)\n- But this takes me away from the upper apples\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\n- Gets me closer to (3, 5) which is 1 left + 2 down = 3 moves\n- Also keeps me in a flexible position\n\nLet me think about strategy. I have 3 apples, enemy has 0. I'm clearly winning. The enemy is at (3, 2) and will likely go for (0, 0) or (6, 0) - bottom apples.\n\nThe apple (3, 5) is interesting - it's at x=3, y=5, which is getting closer to enemy territory but enemy is at (3, 2) so there's distance.\n\nI think UP is a good move because:\n1. It keeps options open\n2. It moves me toward (8, 9) and (9, 7) - both high-value targets\n3. I stay in the upper region away from the enemy\n\nLet me verify UP (5, 8):\n- Not off board \u2713\n- Not my body (my body is at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)) \u2713\n- Not enemy body (enemy has no body) \u2713\n- No head collision risk \u2713\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. UP to (5, 8) now\n2. Then go RIGHT toward (8, 9) or continue UP to (5, 9) then RIGHT\n3. Collect (8, 9), then go for (9, 7)\n4. Keep building lead in upper section\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at (3, 5):\n- From (5, 7), going LEFT to (4, 7), then LEFT to (3, 7), then DOWN to (3, 6), then DOWN to (3, 5) = 4 moves\n- This apple is equidistant with (9, 7) which is 4 moves right\n\nBut the issue is I can't go right immediately. Let me trace my body:\n- Turn 8: Head at (5, 7), body at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)\n- If I go UP to (5, 8), my new body is (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6) - tail at (6, 5) disappears\n- Turn 9: I could go RIGHT to (6, 8) - that's clear now!\n\nSo going UP opens the path to go right next turn. Good plan.\n\nI'll go UP.\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\nMy snake (ID 1):\n- Head at (5, 7)\n- Body at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)\n- 3 apples collected (just got one!)\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head at (3, 2)\n- No body\n- 0 apples collected\n\nApples at: (0, 0), (6, 0), (8, 9), (9, 7), (3, 5)\n\nEvaluating each direction from (5, 7):\n\n1. **UP** (5, 8): Safe move. Opens path toward (8, 9) apple.\n\n2. **DOWN** (5, 6): Safe move. Gets closer to (3, 5) apple.\n\n3. **LEFT** (4, 7): Safe move. Also gets closer to (3, 5).\n\n4. **RIGHT** (6, 7): This is my body! ELIMINATE - death.\n\nRIGHT is eliminated since that's where my body is.\n\nHead collision check:\n- Enemy at (3, 2) can move to (3, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2), or (4, 2)\n- None near my potential moves. No collision risk.\n\nStrategic thinking:\n- I'm at 3 apples vs enemy's 0 - clear lead\n- Going UP to (5, 8) positions me well for the upper apples\n- After UP, my tail at (6, 5) will move, and next turn I can go RIGHT to (6, 8)\n- This opens the path toward (8, 9) and (9, 7) - both close by\n- Enemy is likely heading for bottom apples (0, 0) or (6, 0)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. UP to (5, 8) now\n2. RIGHT to (6, 8) next turn - path will be clear\n3. Continue toward (8, 9) then (9, 7)\n4. Dominate upper board while enemy is in lower section\n\nUP",

The enemy is at (3, 3) and might go for (3, 5) since it's close (just 2 up from them).\n\nFor me, (8, 9) is the closest apple and keeps me in the upper region away from enemy.\n\nLet me think about paths:\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 8), then I can continue RIGHT to (7, 8), then RIGHT to (8, 8), then UP to (8, 9) - 4 moves to apple\n- If I go UP to (5, 9), then I could go RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to (8, 9) - also 4 moves\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are equally good for reaching (8, 9).\n\nLet me think about which one keeps more options open:\n- UP to (5, 9): Next turn I can go LEFT, RIGHT (not DOWN - body at (5, 8) will be there)\n- RIGHT to (6, 8): Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT (need to check body)\n\nAfter I move RIGHT to (6, 8):\n- My new body will be at (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7) - tail at (6, 6) disappears\n- From (6, 8), I can go: UP to (6, 9), DOWN to (6, 7) - wait, (6, 7) is still body! Actually no, let me trace again.\n\nCurrent: Head (5, 8), Body: (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 8):\n- New head: (6, 8)\n- New body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)\n- Tail (6, 6) disappears\n\nSo from (6, 8), next turn:\n- UP to (6, 9): Safe\n- DOWN to (6, 7): That's my body! Not safe\n- LEFT to (5, 8): That's my body! Not safe\n- RIGHT to (7, 8): Safe\n\nSo if I go RIGHT now, next turn I only have UP and RIGHT as safe options. Still decent.\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 9):\n- New head: (5, 9)\n- New body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)\n- Tail (6, 6) disappears\n\nFrom (5, 9), next turn:\n- UP: Off board (y=10)! Not safe\n- DOWN to (5, 8): That's my body! Not safe\n- LEFT to (4, 9): Safe\n- RIGHT to (6, 9): Safe\n\nSo if I go UP now, next turn I have LEFT and RIGHT as safe options. Also decent.\n\nBoth are reasonable. RIGHT gets me closer to (8, 9) more directly. Let me go RIGHT.\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. Going UP puts me at y=9, and from there going right 3 times gets me to (8, 9). Going RIGHT puts me at (6, 8), and I need to go up and right to reach (8, 9).\n\nFrom (5, 9): RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT = (8, 9) apple in 3 moves\nFrom (6, 8): RIGHT to (7, 8), RIGHT to (8, 8), UP to (8, 9) = 3 moves\n\nSame distance!

No collision risk.\n\nUP to (8, 9) is the clear winner - it gets me an apple RIGHT NOW!\n\nAfter eating at (8, 9):\n- My body will be at (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)\n- From (8, 9), only LEFT (7, 9) and RIGHT (9, 9) will be safe (UP is off board, DOWN is body)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. UP to (8, 9) now - collect apple (score: 4)\n2. RIGHT to (9, 9)\n3. DOWN to (9, 8)\n4. DOWN to (9, 7) - collect apple (score: 5)\n5. Maintain strong lead while patrolling upper-right quadrant\n\nThe immediate apple is always the best choice when it's safe!\n\nUP",

DEATH - ELIMINATE\n\n2. **DOWN** (8, 8): This is my body! DEATH - ELIMINATE\n\n3. **LEFT** (7, 9): Safe. No apple, but open space.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 9): Safe. No apple, but puts me in corner.\n\nSafe options: LEFT, RIGHT\n\nLet me think about follow-up options:\n\nFrom LEFT (7, 9):\n- UP (7, 10): Off board - bad\n- DOWN (7, 8): My body at this point? After moving, body will be at (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8). So (7, 8) would be body - bad\n- LEFT (6, 9): Safe\n- RIGHT (8, 9): Body after move - bad\n\nSo from (7, 9), only LEFT (6, 9) seems safe. That's concerning.\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. After I move, my body shifts:\n- If I move LEFT to (7, 9), new body will be: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\n- Tail (5, 8) moves away (didn't eat apple last turn... wait, I did eat an apple at (8, 9) last turn, so I grew)\n\nActually I ate an apple at (8, 9) last turn. So my snake grew. Current body is (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8) - that's 4 segments plus the head.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 9):\n- New head: (7, 9)\n- New body: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)\n- Wait, if I didn't eat an apple this turn, the tail would drop. So body becomes: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\n- Tail (5, 8) drops off\n\nFrom (7, 9) next turn, body at (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8):\n- UP (7, 10): Off board\n- DOWN (7, 8): Body! Bad\n- LEFT (6, 9): Safe\n- RIGHT (8, 9): Body! Bad\n\nSo from (7, 9), only LEFT is safe. That's risky but workable.\n\nFrom RIGHT (9, 9):\n- UP (9, 10): Off board - bad\n- DOWN (9, 8): Safe and toward apple at (9, 7)!\n- LEFT (8, 9): Body after move - bad\n- RIGHT (9, 10): Off board - bad\n\nWait, body after move if I go RIGHT to (9, 9):\n- New head: (9, 9)\n- New body: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\n\nFrom (9, 9):\n- UP: Off board\n- DOWN (9, 8): Safe\n- LEFT (8, 9): Body! Bad\n- RIGHT: Off board\n\nSo from (9, 9), only DOWN is safe. But DOWN leads to (9, 8), then (9, 7) which is an apple!\n\nLet me check the path:\n- This turn: RIGHT to (9, 9)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (9, 8)\n- Turn after: DOWN to (9, 7) - APPLE!\n\nLet me verify (9, 8) is safe:\nAfter moving to (9, 9), body: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\nFrom (9, 9) moving to (9, 8), body: (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)\n(9, 8) is not in that body, so safe!\n\nFrom (9, 8), body: (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)\n- UP (9, 9): Body! Bad\n- DOWN (9, 7): APPLE! Good\n- LEFT (8, 8): Body! Bad\n- RIGHT: Off board\n\nSo DOWN to (9, 7) is the only option from (9, 8), and it's an apple!\n\nFrom (9, 7), body after eating: (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)\n- UP (9, 8): Body! Bad\n- DOWN (9, 6): Safe\n- LEFT (8, 7): Safe\n- RIGHT: Off board\n\nOkay, so the path RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN works and gets me an apple!\n\nWhat about enemy? Snake #0 at (4, 0). It's far from me. It might go for (6, 0) or (0, 0) apples. No collision risk with my positions.\n\nComparing:\n- LEFT: Only one follow-up option (LEFT again), leads away from nearest apple (9, 7)\n- RIGHT: Only one follow-up option (DOWN), but leads directly to apple at (9, 7)!\n\nRIGHT is the better choice - it leads to the apple at (9, 7) in just 2 more moves!\n\nStrategy for next few turns:\n1. RIGHT to (9, 9) now\n2. DOWN to (9, 8)\n3. DOWN to (9, 7) - collect apple (score: 5)\n4. Then continue DOWN or LEFT\n\nRIGHT\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\nMy snake (ID 1):\n- Head at (8, 9)\n- Body at (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)\n- 4 apples collected\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0):\n- Head at (4, 0) - far away, likely going for bottom apples\n\nApples at: (0, 0), (6, 0), (9, 7), (3, 5), (7, 2)\n\nChecking each direction from (8, 9):\n\n1. **UP** (8, 10): Off the board! DEATH - ELIMINATE\n2. **DOWN** (8, 8): My body! DEATH - ELIMINATE\n3. **LEFT** (7, 9): Safe, but checking follow-ups...\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 9): Safe, corner but has escape path\n\nSafe options: LEFT, RIGHT\n\nAnalyzing follow-ups:\n\nFrom LEFT (7, 9):\n- Next turn body: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\n- UP: Off board, DOWN (7, 8): Body, LEFT (6, 9): Safe, RIGHT (8, 9): Body\n- Only LEFT is safe - limited options\n\nFrom RIGHT (9, 9):\n- Next turn body: (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)\n- UP: Off board, DOWN (9, 8): Safe!, LEFT (8, 9): Body, RIGHT: Off board\n- DOWN leads directly toward apple at (9, 7)!\n\nPath analysis for RIGHT:\n1. RIGHT to (9, 9) - now\n2. DOWN to (9, 8) - safe\n3. DOWN to (9, 7) - APPLE! (score: 5)\n\nEnemy at (4, 0) is far away - no collision risk.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. RIGHT to (9, 9) now\n2. DOWN to (9, 8)\n3. DOWN to (9, 7) - collect apple\n4. Continue left or down from there\n\nRIGHT is the clear winner - it leads directly to an apple in 2 moves!\n\nRIGHT",
