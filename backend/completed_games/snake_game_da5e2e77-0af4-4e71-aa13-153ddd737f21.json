The apple at (7, 4) seems like a good target after the one at (1, 3) as it's relatively close.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After reaching the apple at (1, 3), I should aim for the apple at (7, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

I see another apple at (7, 4) which is to the upper right.  I'm also far from that one.  I'm also far from the other apples.\n\nI'm going to prioritize getting closer to the apple at (1, 3) as it's the closest.  Moving up is the best option to get closer to the apple at (1, 3).\n\nStrategy for next turn:  Continue moving towards the apple at (1, 3).
