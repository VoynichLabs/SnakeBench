This is currently empty and not leading to any immediate danger. It would get us closer to the apple at (0,7). Moving UP to (1,7) would be safe, and after that, moving LEFT would reach the apple.\n- DOWN: to (1,5). No immediate benefit, but safe.\n- LEFT: to (0,6).

Moving right is risky because it could approach the walls or the enemy snake at (5,2). It\u2019s less strategic at the moment.\n\nConsidering safety and progress:\n- Moving UP to (1,7) makes sense since it\u2019s aligned with an apple at (0,7).\n- If we go UP, next turn we can go LEFT to reach (0,7) and grow.\n\nThere are no immediate threats of walls or enemy snakes in the adjacent squares. Moving UP seems to steer us toward a nearby apple and keep us safe.\n\nNext plan:\n- Move UP to position (1,7).
