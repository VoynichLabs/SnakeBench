Look at our position at (9, 2) and that rival at (3, 3). He thinks he's safe in the center? Not on my watch! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down the plays! Can we get some HYPE in the chat?\n\n**THE SCOUTER REPORT:**\n- **UP to (9, 3):** Moves us toward that fat stack of apples on the right wall. Look at (9, 3), (9, 5), and (9, 6)! That's a vertical harvest!\n- **DOWN to (9, 1):** Taking us away from the action. We don\u2019t retreat, we CONQUER!\n- **LEFT to (8, 2):** There\u2019s an apple right there at (7, 2). Snagging that would give us the lead and the size advantage early. Size matters when we're trying to box this guy in!\n- **RIGHT to (10, 2):** RIP. Out of bounds. We aren't throwing the game on Turn 1, chat! We're pros!\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nOur rival is at (3, 3). If I go LEFT, I\u2019m positioning myself to contest the middle-ground and snatch (7, 2). If I go UP, I\u2019m securing the right lane. Since we want to grow as a means of DOMINATION, I need to get that first segment ASAP. A head-on collision is a draw right now since scores are 0-0, and we don't settle for draws! \n\nI'm going to head LEFT. Why? Because (7, 2) is the closest apple, and I want to start building my body to cut off his pathing toward the bottom-right corner. We're going to squeeze him until he has nowhere to go! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**FUTURE SIGHT:**\nI'm going to grab (7, 2), then look to pivot toward (8, 3) or (6, 4). Keeping it flexible, keeping it aggressive. Let's get this bread!\n\nLEFT",

If I go **DOWN** now, I\u2019ll be on the path to that apple in the next turn, giving us a 1\u2011point edge before Snake\u202f#1 can even think about it.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 *\u201cWhat\u2019s Snake\u202f#1 gonna do?\u201d*  \nTheir head at (9,2) is chillin\u2019 near the big apple at (9,3) \u2013 an up move would grab it in one go, boosting them to 1 right away. If they go that route, they\u2019ll be heading north while we head south, keeping the gap wide.  \n\ud83d\udd04 Meanwhile, moving down keeps my **x** coordinate unchanged, so I can later pivot left or right without getting stuck in a corner. No risk of hitting my own (non\u2011existent) tail, and the opponent\u2019s body is miles away.  \n\n\ud83e\udded **Long\u2011term plan**:  \n- Turn\u202f1: **DOWN** to (3,2) \u2192 eye the apple at (3,0).  \n- Turn\u202f2: **DOWN** again to (3,1) \u2192 munch that \ud83c\udf4e, grow to size\u202f2.  \n- Turn\u202f3: **LEFT** to (2,1) \u2192 start weaving toward the left\u2011side apples (1,2,\u202f1,4,\u202f1,8) while keeping our x\u2011range flexible.  \n- Turn\u202f4+: Hunt for high\u2011value apples, and when we have a score advantage, **force a head\u2011on collision** with Snake\u202f#1.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 Bottom line: grabbing that bottom\u2011row apple ASAP beats letting the rival get a free snack. Let\u2019s dominate the board, one tasty bite at a time!  \n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "\ud83d\udccc **Future Plan**:  \nGrab the apple at (3,\u202f0) now to jump ahead on score, then **pivot LEFT** next turn to start a horizontal corridor toward the dense left\u2011side apple cluster (1,\u202f2 \u2192 1,\u202f4 \u2192 1,\u202f8). That way my body stays clear of my own tail, I stay a step ahead of the opponent, and I set the stage for a later head\u2011on clash when I\u2019m longer.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f *Turn\u202f2* Plan (focus on enemy & board safety):  \n\u2022 **UP**: (3,\u202f2) is empty, no apple, and leaves me hovering in the middle of the board \u2013 boring.  \n\u2022 **RIGHT**: (4,\u202f1) is empty, but we\u2019d miss the juicy bottom apple.  \n\u2022 **LEFT**: (2,\u202f1) is empty, safe, yet still misses the immediate bite.  \n\u2022 **DOWN**: (3,\u202f0) is occupied by an apple \ud83c\udf4e, giving me +1 point on the same turn we\u2019re both moving. That\u2019s a direct score\u2011boost and a safe move \u2013 no other snake occupies this cell, and I won\u2019t hit my own body because I have none yet.\n\n**Rationale**:  \n\ud83d\ude80 *Why DOWN?* The apple at (3,\u202f0) is literally two cells straight south of my current head. If I go **DOWN**, I lock in that point, grow to size\u202f2, and jump to 1 apple while the rival stays at 0. \ud83c\udf4f That\u2019s the quickest way to dominate the board and force a score\u2011gap that will make future collisions decisive.  \n\n\ud83d\udc0d *What about the opponent?* Snake\u202f#1 sits at (8,\u202f2). They can only claim apples at (7,\u202f2), (8,\u202f3), or (1,\u202f8) in one step \u2013 none of those intersect my vertical march. If they head **LEFT** to (7,\u202f2), they\u2019ll be on the far\u2011right side of the board, giving me a clear lane. If they go **UP** to (8,\u202f3) (also an apple), they\u2019ll be moving away from my corridor, and any head\u2011on attempt later will almost certainly crash into my body if I\u2019m longer.  \n\n\ud83d\udd04 *Long\u2011term dominance*: Eating (3,\u202f0) creates a new tail segment at (3,\u202f1). From there I can slide **LEFT** on Turn\u202f3 without stepping back into my own body (that would be a fatal self\u2011collision). That horizontal stretch opens the left\u2011side apple zone while keeping my snake flexible \u2013 no tight dead\u2011ends, no edge\u2011trapping.  \n\n\ud83d\udcaa *Overall*: Every safe option exists, but only **DOWN** gives me immediate growth + a strategic foothold. I\u2019m not risking the board, I\u2019m stacking the lead, and I\u2019m priming my body for the next decisive moves.  \n\nDOWN",
