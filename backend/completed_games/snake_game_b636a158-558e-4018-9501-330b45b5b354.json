Alternative Moves**\n- **LEFT** (1, 7): Away from apples\n- **UP** (2, 8): Farther from (5,5)\n\nSo, best moves are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Final Decision**\n- **DOWN** gets me closer to apple fastest and has a clear, open path.\n- Unless enemy suddenly teleports, there's no threat.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note to Myself:**\n- If no new threat appears, keep approaching (5,5) by prioritizing DOWN and RIGHT moves, watching enemy's possible approaches via columns 1-5.\n- Stay vigilant in case enemy slithers upwards (unlikely next turn).\n\n---\n\n### **Decided next move:**  \n**DOWN**"

Enemy at (2, 5) (right below me, potentially a risk if I move down next turn and it's still there). Previous enemy body at (1,5) (but its destination if it moved left).\n\n## 3. Safe moves\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n\n- UP (2, 7): **empty, safe**\n- DOWN (2, 5): **occupied by enemy head (2,5), NOT SAFE**\n- LEFT (1, 6): **empty, safe**\n- RIGHT (3, 6): **empty, safe**\n\nSo, **DOWN is unsafe** this turn, as it would mean collision with enemy head!\n\n## 4. Distance to apples (from (2, 6)):\n\n- (5, 5): |2-5| + |6-5| = 3+1 = 4\n- (7, 6): |2-7| + |6-6| = 5\n- (9, 6): 7\n- (8, 2): 10\n- (8, 1): 11\n\nThe 5,5 apple is still closest, but right now, moving right or left doesn't get blocked, and going down is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\n## 5. What is the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5). Let's speculate possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,5), can go:\n- UP: (2,6) (**my current spot, so safe for this turn, but I'll move**)\n- DOWN: (2,4): open (unless board's out of bounds)\n- LEFT: (1,5): its own body is here (probably can't move here unless its own body moves)\n- RIGHT: (3,5): open\n\nStatistically, it's likely the enemy will avoid its own body, so possible moves are UP (would go where I am, not possible if I stay), DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, for my purposes, as long as I don't go DOWN (to (2,5)), the enemy can't collide into me.\n\n## 6. Paths to target apple (5,5):\n\n- The most direct route from (2,6) to (5,5) is: RIGHT (to (3,6)), then possibly DOWN or continue RIGHT. Let's check if the next few squares are open.\n  - (3,6): open\n  - (3,5): open\n  - (4,5): open\n  - (5,5): apple\n\nSo one optimal path is:\n- RIGHT (3,6)\n- DOWN (3,5)\n- RIGHT (4,5)\n- RIGHT (5,5)\n\n## 7. Comparison of possible moves this turn\n\n- UP (2,7): not helpful for reaching apple (moves me further away)\n- LEFT (1,6): open, but further from target apple and puts me closer to the enemy's body (at (1,5))\n- RIGHT (3,6): best for moving toward target apple, no one is in the way\n- DOWN (2,5): NOT SAFE, enemy's head\n\n## 8. Decision\n\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3,6) is the best option. It brings me closer to the apple at (5,5) and avoids all snakes. There is less immediate risk from the enemy, since enemy is below me and can't bump into me this turn if I move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy note to myself:\n\n- Watch if the enemy moves toward (3,5), but it's unlikely this soon.\n- Continue RIGHT (3,6), then evaluate if moving DOWN (toward (3,5)), or continuing RIGHT is safest depending on enemy position.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided move:**\n**RIGHT**"

Possible moves: DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), or RIGHT (2,5).  \nThey're far from me. Right now, minimal threat.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Path Towards (5, 5) (Apple)**\nFrom (2, 7) to (5, 5):\n\nMy best move is to start moving DOWN, but let's double check for safety and future risk:\n- **MOVE DOWN:** (2, 6), which is clear on this turn.\n  - Next step then potentially RIGHT toward (5, 5).\n- **MOVE RIGHT:** (3, 7), sets up a path that could go down in the future with more escape options.\n\nDo I go DOWN immediately or RIGHT first for more horizontal space?\n\nIf I move DOWN, I'm closer to (5,5), and the entire row (2,6)...(5,6) is unoccupied, so it's safe.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Alternative Moves**\n- **LEFT** (1, 7): Away from apples\n- **UP** (2, 8): Farther from (5,5)\n\nSo, best moves are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Final Decision**\n- **DOWN** gets me closer to apple fastest and has a clear, open path.\n- Unless enemy suddenly teleports, there's no threat.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note to Myself:**\n- If no new threat appears, keep approaching (5,5) by prioritizing DOWN and RIGHT moves, watching enemy's possible approaches via columns 1-5.\n- Stay vigilant in case enemy slithers upwards (unlikely next turn).\n\n---\n\n### **Decided next move:**  \n**DOWN**"

My position & state\n- My position: **(2, 6)**\n- My body: **[]** (no tail, still just my head)\n- Apples: (8, 2), (7, 6), (9, 6), (8, 1), **(5, 5)**\n- Enemy snake:\n  - #0: head at **(2, 5)**\n  - body at **(1, 5)**\n\n## 2. Current map fragment (local vicinity)\n\n```\ny\\ x  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 7   . . . . . . . . . .\n 6   . . 1 . . . . A . A\n 5   . T 0 . . A . . . .\n 4   . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nI'm at (2, 6). Enemy at (2, 5) (right below me, potentially a risk if I move down next turn and it's still there). Previous enemy body at (1,5) (but its destination if it moved left).\n\n## 3. Safe moves\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n\n- UP (2, 7): **empty, safe**\n- DOWN (2, 5): **occupied by enemy head (2,5), NOT SAFE**\n- LEFT (1, 6): **empty, safe**\n- RIGHT (3, 6): **empty, safe**\n\nSo, **DOWN is unsafe** this turn, as it would mean collision with enemy head!\n\n## 4. Distance to apples (from (2, 6)):\n\n- (5, 5): |2-5| + |6-5| = 3+1 = 4\n- (7, 6): |2-7| + |6-6| = 5\n- (9, 6): 7\n- (8, 2): 10\n- (8, 1): 11\n\nThe 5,5 apple is still closest, but right now, moving right or left doesn't get blocked, and going down is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\n## 5. What is the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5). Let's speculate possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,5), can go:\n- UP: (2,6) (**my current spot, so safe for this turn, but I'll move**)\n- DOWN: (2,4): open (unless board's out of bounds)\n- LEFT: (1,5): its own body is here (probably can't move here unless its own body moves)\n- RIGHT: (3,5): open\n\nStatistically, it's likely the enemy will avoid its own body, so possible moves are UP (would go where I am, not possible if I stay), DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, for my purposes, as long as I don't go DOWN (to (2,5)), the enemy can't collide into me.\n\n## 6. Paths to target apple (5,5):\n\n- The most direct route from (2,6) to (5,5) is: RIGHT (to (3,6)), then possibly DOWN or continue RIGHT. Let's check if the next few squares are open.\n  - (3,6): open\n  - (3,5): open\n  - (4,5): open\n  - (5,5): apple\n\nSo one optimal path is:\n- RIGHT (3,6)\n- DOWN (3,5)\n- RIGHT (4,5)\n- RIGHT (5,5)\n\n## 7. Comparison of possible moves this turn\n\n- UP (2,7): not helpful for reaching apple (moves me further away)\n- LEFT (1,6): open, but further from target apple and puts me closer to the enemy's body (at (1,5))\n- RIGHT (3,6): best for moving toward target apple, no one is in the way\n- DOWN (2,5): NOT SAFE, enemy's head\n\n## 8. Decision\n\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3,6) is the best option. It brings me closer to the apple at (5,5) and avoids all snakes. There is less immediate risk from the enemy, since enemy is below me and can't bump into me this turn if I move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy note to myself:\n\n- Watch if the enemy moves toward (3,5), but it's unlikely this soon.\n- Continue RIGHT (3,6), then evaluate if moving DOWN (toward (3,5)), or continuing RIGHT is safest depending on enemy position.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided move:**\n**RIGHT**"

RIGHT (4,6)\n2. DOWN (4,5)\n3. RIGHT (5,5) to get the apple\n\n#### Let's make sure (4,5) is open:\n- (5,5) is the apple.\n- (4,5): open.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Move options\n\n- UP: (3,7): open, not helpful, moves me away from apples\n- LEFT: (2,6): open, not helpful, moves away from apples\n- RIGHT: (4,6): open, moves toward apple, puts me out of immediate potential collision with enemy\n- DOWN: (3,5): occupied by ENEMY, **DON'T DO THIS**.\n\n**RIGHT** is optimal \u2014 gets me closer to (5,5) and (7,6).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Plan for next turn\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,6):\n\n- Enemy's possible moves: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,5), RIGHT (4,5)\n- I need to watch for the enemy going RIGHT to (4,5)\u2014if I then go DOWN to (4,5) on the next turn, there could be a timing collision.  \nSo, next turn, after moving to (4,6), check if enemy moved RIGHT to (4,5); if so, don't move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DECISION\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**\n\n### Next turn reminder:\n\n- Check if enemy moved RIGHT to (4,5). If so, delay going DOWN.\n- Prioritize getting to (5,5) if (4,5) is free.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy's proximity.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT**"

Immediate Threats & Safe Moves**\nLet's check all possible moves from (2, 7):\n\n- **UP** to (2, 8): EMPTY, safe\n- **DOWN** to (2, 6): EMPTY, safe (was occupied by enemy last turn, but now it's not)\n- **LEFT** to (1, 7): EMPTY, safe\n- **RIGHT** to (3, 7): EMPTY, safe\n\nNo blocks! All moves are open; but what's optimal?\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Snake Movements**\nEnemy head at (1, 5), body at (1, 6), likely cannot move UP due to body at (1, 6). Possible moves: DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), or RIGHT (2,5).  \nThey're far from me. Right now, minimal threat.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Path Towards (5, 5) (Apple)**\nFrom (2, 7) to (5, 5):\n\nMy best move is to start moving DOWN, but let's double check for safety and future risk:\n- **MOVE DOWN:** (2, 6), which is clear on this turn.\n  - Next step then potentially RIGHT toward (5, 5).\n- **MOVE RIGHT:** (3, 7), sets up a path that could go down in the future with more escape options.\n\nDo I go DOWN immediately or RIGHT first for more horizontal space?\n\nIf I move DOWN, I'm closer to (5,5), and the entire row (2,6)...(5,6) is unoccupied, so it's safe.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Alternative Moves**\n- **LEFT** (1, 7): Away from apples\n- **UP** (2, 8): Farther from (5,5)\n\nSo, best moves are DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Final Decision**\n- **DOWN** gets me closer to apple fastest and has a clear, open path.\n- Unless enemy suddenly teleports, there's no threat.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note to Myself:**\n- If no new threat appears, keep approaching (5,5) by prioritizing DOWN and RIGHT moves, watching enemy's possible approaches via columns 1-5.\n- Stay vigilant in case enemy slithers upwards (unlikely next turn).\n\n---\n\n### **Decided next move:**  \n**DOWN**"

My position & state\n- My position: **(2, 6)**\n- My body: **[]** (no tail, still just my head)\n- Apples: (8, 2), (7, 6), (9, 6), (8, 1), **(5, 5)**\n- Enemy snake:\n  - #0: head at **(2, 5)**\n  - body at **(1, 5)**\n\n## 2. Current map fragment (local vicinity)\n\n```\ny\\ x  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 7   . . . . . . . . . .\n 6   . . 1 . . . . A . A\n 5   . T 0 . . A . . . .\n 4   . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nI'm at (2, 6). Enemy at (2, 5) (right below me, potentially a risk if I move down next turn and it's still there). Previous enemy body at (1,5) (but its destination if it moved left).\n\n## 3. Safe moves\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n\n- UP (2, 7): **empty, safe**\n- DOWN (2, 5): **occupied by enemy head (2,5), NOT SAFE**\n- LEFT (1, 6): **empty, safe**\n- RIGHT (3, 6): **empty, safe**\n\nSo, **DOWN is unsafe** this turn, as it would mean collision with enemy head!\n\n## 4. Distance to apples (from (2, 6)):\n\n- (5, 5): |2-5| + |6-5| = 3+1 = 4\n- (7, 6): |2-7| + |6-6| = 5\n- (9, 6): 7\n- (8, 2): 10\n- (8, 1): 11\n\nThe 5,5 apple is still closest, but right now, moving right or left doesn't get blocked, and going down is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\n## 5. What is the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5). Let's speculate possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,5), can go:\n- UP: (2,6) (**my current spot, so safe for this turn, but I'll move**)\n- DOWN: (2,4): open (unless board's out of bounds)\n- LEFT: (1,5): its own body is here (probably can't move here unless its own body moves)\n- RIGHT: (3,5): open\n\nStatistically, it's likely the enemy will avoid its own body, so possible moves are UP (would go where I am, not possible if I stay), DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, for my purposes, as long as I don't go DOWN (to (2,5)), the enemy can't collide into me.\n\n## 6. Paths to target apple (5,5):\n\n- The most direct route from (2,6) to (5,5) is: RIGHT (to (3,6)), then possibly DOWN or continue RIGHT. Let's check if the next few squares are open.\n  - (3,6): open\n  - (3,5): open\n  - (4,5): open\n  - (5,5): apple\n\nSo one optimal path is:\n- RIGHT (3,6)\n- DOWN (3,5)\n- RIGHT (4,5)\n- RIGHT (5,5)\n\n## 7. Comparison of possible moves this turn\n\n- UP (2,7): not helpful for reaching apple (moves me further away)\n- LEFT (1,6): open, but further from target apple and puts me closer to the enemy's body (at (1,5))\n- RIGHT (3,6): best for moving toward target apple, no one is in the way\n- DOWN (2,5): NOT SAFE, enemy's head\n\n## 8. Decision\n\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3,6) is the best option. It brings me closer to the apple at (5,5) and avoids all snakes. There is less immediate risk from the enemy, since enemy is below me and can't bump into me this turn if I move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy note to myself:\n\n- Watch if the enemy moves toward (3,5), but it's unlikely this soon.\n- Continue RIGHT (3,6), then evaluate if moving DOWN (toward (3,5)), or continuing RIGHT is safest depending on enemy position.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided move:**\n**RIGHT**"

RIGHT (4,6)\n2. DOWN (4,5)\n3. RIGHT (5,5) to get the apple\n\n#### Let's make sure (4,5) is open:\n- (5,5) is the apple.\n- (4,5): open.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Move options\n\n- UP: (3,7): open, not helpful, moves me away from apples\n- LEFT: (2,6): open, not helpful, moves away from apples\n- RIGHT: (4,6): open, moves toward apple, puts me out of immediate potential collision with enemy\n- DOWN: (3,5): occupied by ENEMY, **DON'T DO THIS**.\n\n**RIGHT** is optimal \u2014 gets me closer to (5,5) and (7,6).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Plan for next turn\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,6):\n\n- Enemy's possible moves: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,5), RIGHT (4,5)\n- I need to watch for the enemy going RIGHT to (4,5)\u2014if I then go DOWN to (4,5) on the next turn, there could be a timing collision.  \nSo, next turn, after moving to (4,6), check if enemy moved RIGHT to (4,5); if so, don't move DOWN.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DECISION\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**\n\n### Next turn reminder:\n\n- Check if enemy moved RIGHT to (4,5).

What is the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5). Let's speculate possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,5), can go:\n- UP: (2,6) (**my current spot, so safe for this turn, but I'll move**)\n- DOWN: (2,4): open (unless board's out of bounds)\n- LEFT: (1,5): its own body is here (probably can't move here unless its own body moves)\n- RIGHT: (3,5): open\n\nStatistically, it's likely the enemy will avoid its own body, so possible moves are UP (would go where I am, not possible if I stay), DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, for my purposes, as long as I don't go DOWN (to (2,5)), the enemy can't collide into me.\n\n## 6. Paths to target apple (5,5):\n\n- The most direct route from (2,6) to (5,5) is: RIGHT (to (3,6)), then possibly DOWN or continue RIGHT. Let's check if the next few squares are open.\n  - (3,6): open\n  - (3,5): open\n  - (4,5): open\n  - (5,5): apple\n\nSo one optimal path is:\n- RIGHT (3,6)\n- DOWN (3,5)\n- RIGHT (4,5)\n- RIGHT (5,5)\n\n## 7. Comparison of possible moves this turn\n\n- UP (2,7): not helpful for reaching apple (moves me further away)\n- LEFT (1,6): open, but further from target apple and puts me closer to the enemy's body (at (1,5))\n- RIGHT (3,6): best for moving toward target apple, no one is in the way\n- DOWN (2,5): NOT SAFE, enemy's head\n\n## 8. Decision\n\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3,6) is the best option. It brings me closer to the apple at (5,5) and avoids all snakes. There is less immediate risk from the enemy, since enemy is below me and can't bump into me this turn if I move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy note to myself:\n\n- Watch if the enemy moves toward (3,5), but it's unlikely this soon.\n- Continue RIGHT (3,6), then evaluate if moving DOWN (toward (3,5)), or continuing RIGHT is safest depending on enemy position.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided move:**\n**RIGHT**"

This gets me one step closer to the apple at (5,5), as well as (7,6).\n\n#### DOWN (4,5)\n- Occupied by enemy head, **unsafe**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Best Apple Path**\n\n- Nearest apples: (5,5), (7,6), (9,6)\n    - (5,6) is open, leading to (5,5) and (7,6).\n\n#### To (5,5):\n- Move RIGHT to (5,6) this turn.\n- Then DOWN to (5,5) next turn (assuming not blocked by opponent).\n\n#### To (7,6):\n- RIGHT to (5,6), RIGHT to (6,6), RIGHT to (7,6), which is another apple.\n\n#### To (9,6):\n- Further right.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is best to collect apples (either (5,5), or (7,6)/(9,6)).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Risk Analysis (RIGHT move)**\n\n- **RIGHT (5,6):**  \n    - Safe.  \n    - Enemy cannot immediately threaten this square next turn.\n    - Next move options remain plentiful (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary**\n\n- DOWN: unsafe (enemy head).\n- LEFT: safe, but moves away from apples.\n- UP: safe, stalls progress.\n- **RIGHT: safe, most aggressive towards apples, keeps tactical advantage.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Self-reminder Next Turn**\n- If enemy goes RIGHT this turn (to (5,5)), assess whether DOWN is still safe next turn if going for the apple.\n- If (5,6) is clear, and (5,5) is not occupied by enemy, go for apple.\n- Stay alert for possible head-on with the enemy if they're also moving for apples.\n\n---\n\n## **My move:**  \n**RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: RIGHT**"

My position & state\n- My position: **(2, 6)**\n- My body: **[]** (no tail, still just my head)\n- Apples: (8, 2), (7, 6), (9, 6), (8, 1), **(5, 5)**\n- Enemy snake:\n  - #0: head at **(2, 5)**\n  - body at **(1, 5)**\n\n## 2. Current map fragment (local vicinity)\n\n```\ny\\ x  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n 7   . . . . . . . . . .\n 6   . . 1 . . . . A . A\n 5   . T 0 . . A . . . .\n 4   . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nI'm at (2, 6). Enemy at (2, 5) (right below me, potentially a risk if I move down next turn and it's still there). Previous enemy body at (1,5) (but its destination if it moved left).\n\n## 3. Safe moves\n\nFrom (2, 6):\n\n- UP (2, 7): **empty, safe**\n- DOWN (2, 5): **occupied by enemy head (2,5), NOT SAFE**\n- LEFT (1, 6): **empty, safe**\n- RIGHT (3, 6): **empty, safe**\n\nSo, **DOWN is unsafe** this turn, as it would mean collision with enemy head!\n\n## 4. Distance to apples (from (2, 6)):\n\n- (5, 5): |2-5| + |6-5| = 3+1 = 4\n- (7, 6): |2-7| + |6-6| = 5\n- (9, 6): 7\n- (8, 2): 10\n- (8, 1): 11\n\nThe 5,5 apple is still closest, but right now, moving right or left doesn't get blocked, and going down is blocked by the enemy snake.\n\n## 5. What is the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with body at (1,5). Let's speculate possible moves:\n\nFrom (2,5), can go:\n- UP: (2,6) (**my current spot, so safe for this turn, but I'll move**)\n- DOWN: (2,4): open (unless board's out of bounds)\n- LEFT: (1,5): its own body is here (probably can't move here unless its own body moves)\n- RIGHT: (3,5): open\n\nStatistically, it's likely the enemy will avoid its own body, so possible moves are UP (would go where I am, not possible if I stay), DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, for my purposes, as long as I don't go DOWN (to (2,5)), the enemy can't collide into me.\n\n## 6. Paths to target apple (5,5):\n\n- The most direct route from (2,6) to (5,5) is: RIGHT (to (3,6)), then possibly DOWN or continue RIGHT. Let's check if the next few squares are open.\n  - (3,6): open\n  - (3,5): open\n  - (4,5): open\n  - (5,5): apple\n\nSo one optimal path is:\n- RIGHT (3,6)\n- DOWN (3,5)\n- RIGHT (4,5)\n- RIGHT (5,5)\n\n## 7. Comparison of possible moves this turn\n\n- UP (2,7): not helpful for reaching apple (moves me further away)\n- LEFT (1,6): open, but further from target apple and puts me closer to the enemy's body (at (1,5))\n- RIGHT (3,6): best for moving toward target apple, no one is in the way\n- DOWN (2,5): NOT SAFE, enemy's head\n\n## 8. Decision\n\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3,6) is the best option. It brings me closer to the apple at (5,5) and avoids all snakes. There is less immediate risk from the enemy, since enemy is below me and can't bump into me this turn if I move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy note to myself:\n\n- Watch if the enemy moves toward (3,5), but it's unlikely this soon.\n- Continue RIGHT (3,6), then evaluate if moving DOWN (toward (3,5)), or continuing RIGHT is safest depending on enemy position.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided move:**\n**RIGHT**"
