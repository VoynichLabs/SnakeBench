Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk. Therefore, a cautious approach involves avoiding hazardous areas, together with a strategy to possibly move right in the next turn, reassessing the situation.\n\nContinuing with the cautious approach, I'll move:\n\n**TO DOWN**",

However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk. Therefore, a cautious approach involves avoiding hazardous areas, together with a strategy to possibly move right in the next turn, reassessing the situation.\n\nContinuing with the cautious approach, I'll move:\n\n**TO DOWN**",

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Moving to the right (R) first would place my snake head at (4, 1), which is dangerous, so instead, I'll think two steps ahead.\n\nI'll first move to the right (R) twice, getting closer to a suitable position for the apple at (5, 2), yet still safe from Snake #1. After moving to (5, 2), my next move should position me to access the apple while minimizing risk:\n\nMoving DOWN (D) twice to (5, 0), which puts me in a position to move UP (U) twice and reach the apple at (5, 5).\n\nSo, my strategy is to move:\n- Right twice: R, R\n- Down twice: D, D\n- Up twice: U, U\n\n**My new board state will look like this:**\n```\n9 . . . . . . . .

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk. Therefore, a cautious approach involves avoiding hazardous areas, together with a strategy to possibly move right in the next turn, reassessing the situation.\n\nContinuing with the cautious approach, I'll move:\n\n**TO DOWN**",

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**. The next move strategy would revolve around reassessing this position after the turn has passed, potentially looking to move towards (6, 0) or (4, 0) if the enemy snake's movement does not pose an immediate threat, but only if it secures safety on my next turn.\n\n**TO DOWN**\n**END OF RATIONALE**\n\nGiven the conditions, due to the need for safety yet still looking to score, my next move next turn will be **RIGHT**, aiming for a safer position without risking collision, hoping that it keeps me clear of snake #1's potential trajectories as well.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1.

Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy.

Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT.

I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

The fact that a part of my snake is on the path to the apples increases the risk, so timing and movement direction are critical. Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**. The next move strategy would revolve around reassessing this position after the turn has passed, potentially looking to move towards (6, 0) or (4, 0) if the enemy snake's movement does not pose an immediate threat, but only if it secures safety on my next turn.\n\n**TO DOWN**\n**END OF RATIONALE**\n\nGiven the conditions, due to the need for safety yet still looking to score, my next move next turn will be **RIGHT**, aiming for a safer position without risking collision, hoping that it keeps me clear of snake #1's potential trajectories as well. Now, at (6, 1), if snake #1 does not pose an immediate threat, I can then consider going down again in the subsequent turns for better score opportunities. \n\n**NEXT MOVE: RIGHT**",

This apple is within the range of my head, so I will continue to look at this long-term goal while dealing with more immediate threats.\n\nTaking into account the positions of other snakes and apples, the most prudent next move would be **RIGHT**, gently pushing towards (6, 1) and (6, 2).

The fact that a part of my snake is on the path to the apples increases the risk, so timing and movement direction are critical. Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

This anticipatory move will help me decide the safest direction to anticipate the enemy's traction.

However, the (8, 9) apple is in a risky area given my current position.\n\nA suitable move could be to position myself on the right side and increase the distance from Snake #1. Moving to the right (R) first would place my snake head at (4, 1), which is dangerous, so instead, I'll think two steps ahead.\n\nI'll first move to the right (R) twice, getting closer to a suitable position for the apple at (5, 2), yet still safe from Snake #1.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

The fact that a part of my snake is on the path to the apples increases the risk, so timing and movement direction are critical. Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

The ally's current location at (8, 8), slivers around from the closest apple, is prudent. Snake #1 centered (5, 2) is within the threat zone, giving the ally a tactical advantage.\n\n\nMy next approach is analytical; Snake #1's position at (5, 2) suggests it may advance DOWN to (6, 2) or LEFT to (5, 1), due to proximity and advantageous lines of sight. This anticipatory move will help me decide the safest direction to anticipate the enemy's traction. My priority is pushing proximity between myself and the close-by apple (5, 5) without opening a line forward to an attack.\n\n\nReviewing the board with these factors in mind, if Snake #1 moves DOWN, be it to (6, 2) or (6, 1), the safest path is LEFT to (8, 7). However, this would put me too close to Snake #1 and the (8, 9) apple on the downside.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider.

Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

The fact that a part of my snake is on the path to the apples increases the risk, so timing and movement direction are critical. Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time. With a more centralized snake, I have better movement options and more control over reaching the fruit without immediate risk.\n\nAs such, my next strategic move is UP.",

The ally's current location at (8, 8), slivers around from the closest apple, is prudent. Snake #1 centered (5, 2) is within the threat zone, giving the ally a tactical advantage.\n\n\nMy next approach is analytical; Snake #1's position at (5, 2) suggests it may advance DOWN to (6, 2) or LEFT to (5, 1), due to proximity and advantageous lines of sight. This anticipatory move will help me decide the safest direction to anticipate the enemy's traction. My priority is pushing proximity between myself and the close-by apple (5, 5) without opening a line forward to an attack.\n\n\nReviewing the board with these factors in mind, if Snake #1 moves DOWN, be it to (6, 2) or (6, 1), the safest path is LEFT to (8, 7). However, this would put me too close to Snake #1 and the (8, 9) apple on the downside.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1. However, the apple at (7,7) is closer and down is a safe path without risk.\n\nNow, if I move down, I'll be at (5, 0), one position directly below my current head position, which isn't risking an instant game over but also not in direct pursuit of an apple. \n\nThe next logical thought is to move right, to get closer to an apple to maximize points while staying safe from the enemy. Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk. Therefore, a cautious approach involves avoiding hazardous areas, together with a strategy to possibly move right in the next turn, reassessing the situation.\n\nContinuing with the cautious approach, I'll move:\n\n**TO DOWN**",

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**. The next move strategy would revolve around reassessing this position after the turn has passed, potentially looking to move towards (6, 0) or (4, 0) if the enemy snake's movement does not pose an immediate threat, but only if it secures safety on my next turn.\n\n**TO DOWN**\n**END OF RATIONALE**\n\nGiven the conditions, due to the need for safety yet still looking to score, my next move next turn will be **RIGHT**, aiming for a safer position without risking collision, hoping that it keeps me clear of snake #1's potential trajectories as well.

The fact that a part of my snake is on the path to the apples increases the risk, so timing and movement direction are critical. Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2.

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Snake #1 centered (5, 2) is within the threat zone, giving the ally a tactical advantage.\n\n\nMy next approach is analytical; Snake #1's position at (5, 2) suggests it may advance DOWN to (6, 2) or LEFT to (5, 1), due to proximity and advantageous lines of sight. This anticipatory move will help me decide the safest direction to anticipate the enemy's traction. My priority is pushing proximity between myself and the close-by apple (5, 5) without opening a line forward to an attack.\n\n\nReviewing the board with these factors in mind, if Snake #1 moves DOWN, be it to (6, 2) or (6, 1), the safest path is LEFT to (8, 7). However, this would put me too close to Snake #1 and the (8, 9) apple on the downside. Conversely, FOUR UP moves would lead indirectly towards (6, 4) without crossing into danger\u2014still gaining inching steps towards (5, 5).\n\n\nTaking another look at the positioning, ascending UP not only evades Snake #1\u2019s probable downward movement near (6, 2) or (6, 1) but also sidesteps a direct collision with Snake #1, ever so slightly relevant but none the less risky.\n\n\nMy STRATEGY: IDENTIFY the intersection near the enemy\u2019s path to volley ball and approach the apple cautiously but surely.\n\n\nSo, the nod goes to UP for my next move. This strategy minimizes risk while allowing measured growth.\n\n**DECIDED NEXT MOVE: UP**",

Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT.

I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider.

Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT. This decision is made with the following considerations:\n\n1. I am currently closer to the apple at (5, 5) than the apple at (1, 2), which is a tactical choice even if it means postponing the immediate gain.\n2. Moving RIGHT allows me to potentially reposition around the apple at (5, 5) if Snake #1",

However, Snake #1, my opponent, is still at (5, 2), which places Snake #1 above and below the apple. This poses a direct risk if I move straight for the apple. My snake extends to the right, so moving UP could be a smart move to get a better perspective and control of the situation.\n\nWhile the apple at (5, 5) tempts me to make a swift move, the right move is not to follow my instincts, but to exploit the game mechanics to my advantage. I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Observing the snake #1's current location (3, 2), I should avoid the surrounding areas to mitigate risk from the enemy. Given I'm currently at (5, 1), the safest move could be going downwards to (5, 0) or rightwards avoiding areas near snake #1.

Although moving right would mean avoiding immediate risk from snake #1, the position (6, 0) is dangerous as it might lead to a direct collision with the enemy head if they choose to move down or get unpredictably close.\n\nGiven the current board state and striving to have the most points while remaining alive, I don't see an optimal move at this point since all the directions carry some degree of risk.

However, the risk of the head of snake #1 potentially moving in any direction to collide with us is something to consider. Staying at (5, 1) could also be safe temporarily, but it won't help me gain points if I want to maximize the game score.\n\nTaking into account that the apple at (7, 7) is quite out of reach in just one turn due to the enemy snake and although moving towards (6, 0) could get me closer, as mentioned earlier, it would not guarantee safety.\n\nHere's my full thought process:\n\n1. Moving down avoids both the nearby snake #1 and apples that I cannot yet reach. This minimizes the risk while remaining on safe ground.\n2. Positioning myself at (5, 0) helps my snake stay balanced and be prepared for subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering these factors, my chosen move would be **DOWN**.

Observing my current position (8, 6), the apples near me are at (5, 5) to my left and at (1, 2) below me. My enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (5, 2), and their dangerous proximity to the apple at (5, 5) makes it even riskier to go for it right now.\n\nMy initial move should be a cautious advancement that keeps me safe and allows for future planning. Opting for the right direction (RIGHT) feels reasonable as it still keeps me aligned with the apple at (5, 5). Although slightly risky, this move is a subtle approach to gaining points without direct confrontation since moving LEFT would lead to an immediate collision with Snake #1's head, and DOWN only gets me closer to my head's position without any strategic advantage, which might lead to an accidental collision with myself.\n\nUp (UP) is not immediately valuable given my current position (8, 6), as I'm already near the top row, and up could lead to unnecessary risks with Snake #1's head potentially closing in. Going LEFT (LEFT) at this stage poses a significant risk of encountering Snake #1, and moving DOWN (DOWN), while safer, doesn't align with my current objective of maximizing points through apple picking. So, I'll PM myself to stay alert, monitor Snake #1's movements, and look for a chance to refill my snake with apples without danger.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT.

I'll move UP to (9, 8), aligning my snake's head with the apple at (5, 5), and preserve the original configuration of my snake's body corners, which in this case are (0, 0) and (9, 9). This strategic maneuver will allow me to remain in an optimal position to either reach the apple or change direction if necessary without colliding with Snake #1.\n\n**END THOUGHTS**\nConsidering Snake #1's proximity to the apple, it's crucial for me to avoid a direct confrontation and instead bide my time.

Similarly, right will also lead me into the game's continuous vertical line of travel and toward the proximity of Snake #1, which I'll want to keep a safe distance from.\n\n\nMoving down is not only against my objective to move closer to the apple but could also increase the risk of a direct line to Snake #1's predicted path.\n\n\n**Strategy:** Prioritize consuming the apple at (5, 5) while maintaining spatial awareness of Snake #1's potential movements and avoiding a direct confrontation. My next turn should aim to grow by moving towards food without risking an immediate trap.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**",
