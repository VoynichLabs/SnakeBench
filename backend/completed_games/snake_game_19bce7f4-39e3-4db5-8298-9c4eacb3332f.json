Moving LEFT seems promising to approach that apple.\n- Moving DOWN would be back into the snake's current position or the bottom rows, which seem less strategic.\n\nNext, considering safety:\n- Moving LEFT: (4,4) is safe, not occupied.\n- Moving UP: (5,5) is safe and nearer to the apple at (4,5), but slightly farther.\n- Moving RIGHT: (6,4), safe, but less directly toward nearest apple.\n- Moving DOWN: (5,3), which may lead towards the enemy or dead ends.\n\nSince the apple at (4,5) is just above our current position, moving UP would be a direct step toward it. But let's check for any immediate danger:\n\n- Moving UP: head will go to (5,5). No walls or obstacles at that spot.\n- Moving LEFT: head will go to (4,4). Also safe.\n- Moving RIGHT: head to (6,4). Safe, but less optimal.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, going UP brings us directly closer to the apple at (4,5). Noticing that the apple is slightly above and to the left, choosing UP keeps us on a clear path directly to the apple.\n\nTherefore, the best strategic move is to go UP, moving toward the apple at (4,5).\n\n**Next move: UP**"
