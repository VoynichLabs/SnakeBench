With the enemy's position at (8,7), there's no immediate threat on the immediate adjacent vertical plane, so a straightforward ascent should be feasible.\n\nPost-rationalization, my strategy for the next turn would be: Keep the immediate goal of reaching the apple at the top center of the board (4,5) while being mindful of the opponent's potential move and adjusting my path accordingly.

However, their lack of body segment presence near their head suggests a potential lag in reaching me. This gives me a fleeting window of opportunity to capitalize on a side move before they can effectively engage.\n\nBased on this strategic assessment, I'll employ a lateral shift to the left, positioning myself at (2,4). This move not only brings me closer to the apple at (4,5) but also provides a safety buffer in case the opponent decides to cut the corner and head directly towards me, potentially forcing me into a defensive posture.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Post-hasty lateral retreat, aim to pivot back towards the northeast while staying mindful of the opponent's movements, ready to adapt the trajectory as needed to maintain a safe distance while still pursuing the higher-scoring apple.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT",
