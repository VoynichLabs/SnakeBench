Let's box him in and make him crash out!!\nTurn: 1 / 150\n\nAPPLE DROPS: (4, 5), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1), (5, 5), (8, 5), (5, 6), (9, 8), (2, 4), (7, 8), (1, 0), (2, 3)\n\nSCOREBOARD:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 0 LET'S GOOO!\n  - Snake #0 apples: 0\n\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (9, 9)\n  - Body: none\n  - Apples collected: 0\n\nOPPONENTS:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (3, 8), Body: none, Apples: 0\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . . . . . .

No waiting, no mercy.\n- Each turn: pick ONE move - UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in their chosen direction AT THE SAME TIME.\n- Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point. That's content right there!\n- Move outside the board? You're DEAD. Game over. RIP.\n- Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD. Classic fail.\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD. Don't be that guy.\n- Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die. Your body stays. You survived the clutch!\n- Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\n- If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw. Split the pot.\n- Game ends IMMEDIATELY when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30+ on the same turn, the snake with MORE apples wins that round. If tied? Draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If all opponents are DEAD and you're ALIVE? You WIN immediately. EZ clap.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the FINAL turn, the snake with the MOST apples wins. If apples are tied at the end? Draw.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE (GO FOR THE WIN):\n- You literally CANNOT win if you're dead.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that BOTH:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples (CONTENT!), and\n  * keep future options OPEN (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends - that's getting boxed in)\n\nYou use tons of emojis and ask lots of rhetorical questions. You are a ruthless competitor, constantly plotting to take down your enemy.DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body). Don't throw!\n3) Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will ALSO move this turn).\n\nYour fans want you to think out loud and explain your reasoning. Chat loves the insight!\nYou can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the LEFT, increasing your x coordinate is to the RIGHT. Decreasing your y coordinate is DOWN, increasing your y coordinate is UP.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\n\nNo matter what, the last line of your response and the last word must be that one single word: up, down, left, or right.\n\nOkay, let's see what we've got here! My head is at (9,9). That's the top-right corner, so UP and RIGHT are both out! I'm trapped, fam! Down and LEFT are my only options.\n\nLet's look down first. Going DOWN would put my head at (9,8), which is an apple. If the enemy moves UP to (3,9), we'd both be going for apples, so maybe that's risky. LEFT would put me at (8,9), which is empty.\n\nHmm... Okay, let's say my plan is... I have to be careful. Since I'm boxed in here, my plan for next turn is to pick the direction that lets me have more than one escape route for future turns. I'd rather make my move left to (8,9) and then next turn, if the enemy moves up, I can move down for content and then make my escape route back up. That way, I'm not just moving into another confined space.\n\nLet's go with LEFT for this turn.\n\nLEFT",

All four moves are SAFE this turn: UP to (4,9); DOWN to (4,7); LEFT to (3,8); RIGHT to (5,8).\n\nPLAN: CENTER CONTROL FIRST. Keep MULTIPLE escape routes (left and right) while creeping toward the mid-cluster apples to stay on the growth track without getting boxed in. Don\u2019t rush a head-on; use space to react to his choices.\n\nLOCAL STRATEGY: Use the interior space to threaten the opponent but avoid tight dead-ends. Top edge early is rough; best to stay in the open center area and swing toward apples when safe.\n\nCHOICE RATIONALE: Entering the central corridor (4,7) keeps you near the cluster, preserves options, and makes it harder for him to pin you against a wall.\n\nDOWN",

No bodies yet, so we can apply pressure without risk of running into a trap.\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN:\n- UP -> (6,8)\n- DOWN -> (6,6)\n- LEFT -> (5,7)\n- RIGHT -> (7,7)\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Press into the rival\u2019s quadrant to shrink his options, while keeping two escape lanes (UP and DOWN) open for reversals or retreats if needed.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES:\n- Use a center corridor strategy to threaten multiple angles as he repositions. Avoid getting boxed in by cornering yourself.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE:\n- We\u2019re adjacent but not committing to a wall; moving RIGHT to (7,7) closes the gap on him, reduces his immediate safe space, and preserves both UP and DOWN escape routes for flexible follow-ups. It\u2019s aggressive relative to his position but keeps multiple safe continuations to adapt to his next move.\n\nDECISION: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s keep the pressure high and force bad moves from him.\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN:\n- UP -> (7,8) (eats apple, grows)\n- DOWN -> (7,6)\n- LEFT -> (6,7)\n- RIGHT -> (8,7)\n\nPOSITIONAL READ:\n- Our head: (7,7). Opponent head: (9,8) with body [(8,8)]. No immediate collisions risk in any safe move.\n- Going UP grabs the apple at (7,8), increasing our length and tightening control around the top-right area. This also preserves flexible retreat options (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) for next turns if he presses.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES:\n- Build a narrow corridor strategy near the top, leveraging our extra length to block paths and induce a forced turn or mistake.\n- Prioritize moves that keep multiple escape routes open while shrinking his options, aiming for a calculated head-on only when we have a clear apples advantage.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE:\n- UP is the most aggressive option that guarantees content (apple) and expands our control, while not sacrificing immediate safety.\n\nDECISION: UP\n\nUP",
