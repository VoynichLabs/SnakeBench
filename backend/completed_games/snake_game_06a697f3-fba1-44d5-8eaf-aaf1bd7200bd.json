Moving down again seems like a good idea to get closer. However, I need to be mindful of the enemy snake at (3, 8).\n\nStrategy for next turn: I need to try and avoid the enemy snake. I should try to move towards the apple while keeping the enemy snake in my peripheral vision.\n\nDOWN",

Moving toward (3, 7) seems promising because it\u2019s relatively close and directly accessible via current position.\n- Moving RIGHT from (1, 8) to (2, 8) would bring me closer to the apple at (3, 7), moving in the positive x direction.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 8) would stray from the immediate targets, and while it gets me closer to the apple at (0, 0), the path might be longer and less safe since (0, 8) is near the left boundary and might limit future options.\n- Moving UP to (1, 9) is a safe move but risks going off the top of the grid in subsequent moves, especially if I try to go even higher next turn.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 7) takes me further away from the closest apples I\u2019m considering, which might not be optimal.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Moving RIGHT toward (2, 8) positions me to approach the apple at (3, 7) efficiently.\n- It seems the best balance of safety and progress.\n\nNext, I should keep safety in mind, avoiding collisions with walls, my own body, or enemy snakes. Since the snake is only length 1, there's no concern about self-collision for now. Enemy snake at (8, 0) is distant, so no immediate threat there.\n\nTherefore, I will move RIGHT to continue progressing toward the apple at (3, 7).\n\nNext move: RIGHT",
