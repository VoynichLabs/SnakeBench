We're at the top-left corner at (2,9), and the enemy snake is chilling at (5,0) - they're way across the map. No bodies to worry about yet, just pure board control. \n\nHere's the game plan: We need to dominate the board and box this archrival OUT. I see apples ALL over the place, but I'm not just hunting - I'm hunting to CORNER them. We're going to cut off their escape routes and force them into bad moves.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MY OPTIONS:**\n\n**UP (2,10)** - \u274c OFF BOARD! Dead on arrival. Not gonna happen.\n\n**DOWN (2,8)** - \u2705 SAFE! No obstacles, opens up the board. I can move toward the cluster of apples in the middle. This keeps my options WIDE open.\n\n**LEFT (1,9)** - \u2705 SAFE! Moves me left, but I'm already at x=2, y=9 (top row). If I go LEFT, I'm heading toward the left wall. That might trap me against the edge. Not ideal for long-term mobility.\n\n**RIGHT (3,9)** - \u2705 SAFE! Moves me right, but I'm at the top row already. If I keep going right, I might corner myself against the right wall eventually. Still, this gets me closer to some apples.\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nI'm going **DOWN** to (2,8)! Why? \n- It keeps me OFF the walls (crucial for mobility)\n- Opens up the entire board for future plays\n- Puts me in a central position to dominate the middle\n- Gives me multiple escape routes next turn\n- The enemy is so far away at (5,0) that I don't need to worry about immediate collision - I can play the long game and set up for a cornering strategy\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn, I'll likely head toward the apple at (3,7) or (1,5) depending on where the enemy moves. The key is to stay central and flexible while they're stuck in the bottom corner. Once I start collecting apples and growing, I can use my body to create barriers and cut off their access to apples. The enemy is isolated - let's make them regret playing Snake against the GOAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

It keeps you flexible, doesn\u2019t commit to a wall, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups. It also avoids a premature head-on risk since the opponent is far away and you\u2019re not racing to the edge.\n\nPlan for the next turns: stay alive, push toward the center to open lines for future ambush or escape, monitor the opponent\u2019s path, and only trade into a head-on if you have a clear apples-lead advantage.\n\nMake the call: \n\nUP",

Turn 1 and we're already planning the box-out! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n\nOkay squad, we just moved DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8) - perfect! Now we're in a central position with the entire board open. The enemy is still chilling at (5,1) with their head down low. Time to analyze and make the move!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- Our head: (2,8) - centrally positioned, not against any wall yet\n- Enemy head: (5,1) - bottom middle, completely away from us\n- No bodies on the board - we're both fresh! Pure skill matchup.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere will snake #0 go? They're at (5,1). Their options:\n- UP (5,2): Safe, moves toward middle\n- DOWN (5,0): OFF BOARD - would kill them!\n- LEFT (4,1): Safe, toward apple cluster\n- RIGHT (6,1): Safe, toward middle\n\nMost likely they'll go UP or RIGHT to get away from the bottom wall and toward apples. I'm predicting they'll go UP to (5,2).\n\n**OUR OPTIONS - ELIMINATING THE DEAD ONES:**\n\n**UP (2,9)** - \u2705 SAFE but NOT IDEAL\n- We'd be back at the top row (y=9). If we keep going UP from there later, we die. Limited mobility.\n- Only 1 safe follow-up move (DOWN back to here). Getting boxed in! \u274c\n\n**DOWN (2,7)** - \u2705 SAFE and EXCELLENT\n- Moves us deeper into central play\n- Opens up paths to multiple apples: (3,7) right next door, (1,5) close by\n- Keeps us OFF walls (crucial!)\n- Multiple follow-up options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all safe\n- Strategic positioning to dominate the middle and eventually cut off enemy's access to upper half \u2705\n\n**LEFT (1,8)** - \u2705 SAFE but LIMITED\n- Gets us closer to apple at (1,5) \n- However, moving us left toward edge. We're at x=2 already, so left wall getting closer\n- Fewer long-term options than DOWN \u2705\n\n**RIGHT (3,8)** - \u2705 SAFE and STRONG\n- Moves right, good central position\n- Gets us closer to apples at (3,7), (3,3), (4,3) etc.\n- Multiple follow-up options\n- BUT - DOWN gives us even better board control and avoids the wall approach\n\n**THE VERDICT: DOWN to (2,7)** \nWhy DOWN wins:\n- MAXIMIZES mobility - keeps us central, away from walls\n- Opens up the entire board for the next 5-10 turns\n- Puts us at y=7, x=2 - perfect central spawn position\n- Enemy is way down at (5,1) - we have time to establish dominance\n- We can hunt apples while keeping escape routes open\n- This is about BOARD CONTROL, not just one apple!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY (for future me):**\nWe're going to establish a \"zone of death\" in the upper half of the board. While enemy is stuck at the bottom, we'll collect apples in the top 4 rows (there's an apple at (0,8) right near us!). Then we'll use our growing body as a barrier to cut off their vertical movement. Once we hit 5-6 apples, we can start actively boxing them in. Force them into a corner, then crash into them when we have the length advantage. \n\nThis is chess, not checkers. We're building a fortress! \ud83c\udff0\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's break it down LIVE! \ud83c\udfa5\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **Our head:** (2,7) - Perfect central position!\n- **Enemy head:** (5,2) - Still low, they moved UP from (5,1)!\n- **Score:** 0-0 - TIME TO SECURE THE FIRST APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Our body:** None (we're still growing!)\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Turn 2):**\nSnake #0 at (5,2) just moved UP. Their options:\n- **UP (5,3):** SAFE - moves toward apple clusters at (3,3), (4,3)!\n- **DOWN (5,1):** SAFE - goes back\n- **LEFT (4,2):** SAFE - toward apples\n- **RIGHT (6,2):** SAFE - toward center\n\nThey're likely chasing apples! I predict **UP to (5,3)** or **LEFT to (4,2)** - either way, they're heading toward the apple-rich area in the bottom-center.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS - ANALYZING THE BOARD:**\n\n**UP to (2,8)** - \ud83d\udd34 DANGEROUS!\n- Back to where we were before\n- But wait... we just came from (2,9) last turn, then DOWN to (2,8), now UP back? That's BACKWARDS into our old path! \ud83d\udea8 **WE DIE!** \ud83d\udea8\n- Even if not exactly our path, we're approaching the top wall. Limited mobility. \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (2,6)** - \u2705 EXCELLENT!\n- Moves us DEEPER into central territory (y=6)\n- **DIRECT PATH to apple at (1,5) and (3,7)!**\n- Opens up: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT - all safe for future turns\n- Moves us AWAY from enemy who is at y=2 - we're building distance! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- This is **BOARD CONTROL** - we own the top half! \ud83d\udd12\n\n**LEFT to (1,7)** - \u2705 GOOD but LIMITED\n- Gets us CLOSER to apple at (1,5) and (1,3)\n- BUT moves us toward left wall (x=0 is getting closer)\n- Fewer long-term options than DOWN \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**RIGHT to (3,7)** - \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE INBOUND!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **IMMEDIATE APPLE EAT!** (3,7) is RIGHT THERE!\n- We grow to length 1, get +1 score = 1-0 lead!\n- BUT... right wall is at x=9, we're at x=3, so still okay\n- However, we need to think LONG-TERM: Eating this apple now puts us at (3,7) with our body following behind. Next turn, our options become: UP, DOWN, LEFT (to (2,7)), or RIGHT (to (4,7)). That's still 4 options, but we're getting closer to the right edge.\n\n**THE STRATEGY DILEMMA:**\n- **RIGHT (3,7)** = IMMEDIATE APPLE +1 SCORE! But compromises some mobility\n- **DOWN (2,6)** = NO APPLE NOW, but MAXIMUM board control and future flexibility\n\n**MY DECISION: RIGHT to (3,7) for the APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY?** \n1. **Score first!** We need to get on the board. 1-0 is better than 0-0.\n2. **The apple is literally one step away** - grabbing it now prevents enemy from taking it later\n3. **We're still in a great spot** - (3,7) gives us access to (3,3), (4,0), (6,6), and more apples\n4. **Enemy is far away** - at y=2, we're at y=7 - we have space to grow\n5. **Growth = Power** - longer body = better blocking potential later\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter eating (3,7) at turn 2, our new head will be at (3,7) with body at (2,7). Turn 3, we'll likely go DOWN to (3,6) to maintain central positioning while eyeing apples at (4,3), (6,6), (7,7). We'll use our growing body to establish a \"zone of control\" in the top-right quadrant, forcing enemy into the bottom-left. When we hit 3-4 apples, we start the box-out! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**FINAL CALL:** RIGHT for the apple! Let's get that first point on the board, chat! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re aiming to pressure from the center and use growth to cage him, but we must stay safe.\n\nPLAN:\n- Eat the nearby apple now by moving LEFT to (3,3). This grows us and gives more options to threaten the center lanes.\n- After that, push upward along the central column to press toward the opponent while keeping several escape options open.\n- Avoid tight dead-ends. Let the opponent commit to a path and look for a favorable head-on only if we have a clear advantage.\n\nDECISION PROCESS:\n1) Evaluate four directions from (4,3):\n   - UP -> (4,4): safe, but no immediate gain.\n   - DOWN -> (4,2): safe, but no immediate gain.\n   - LEFT -> (3,3): safe, and it eats an apple now.\n   - RIGHT -> (5,3): into our own body (dead). Not allowed.\n2) Among safe moves, LEFT gives an immediate apple and improves future control; UP/DOWN are solid but not as game-changing this turn.\n3) We avoid risky head-ons since scores are equal; we don\u2019t want to trade our life for a marginal gain.\n\nCHOICE:\nLEFT\n\nNote: If you\u2019re watching live, this sets us up to grow, centralize, and pressure the rival without surrendering safety. We\u2019ll keep you posted on the chase and adjust as their moves unfold. \n\nleft",

We NEED to eat that apple at (6,6) to tie it up! The right move is obvious - **RIGHT to (5,6)**!

On turn 6, we'll go RIGHT to (6,6) and EAT that apple! That'll tie the score 2-2!

Time to be RUTHLESS! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **Our head:** (6,6) - Just ate the apple! We grew!\n- **Our body:** [(5,6), (4,6)] - The tail at (4,6) will move away next turn.\n- **Enemy head:** (2,2) - They moved LEFT from (3,2)! They're in the bottom-left corner.\n- **Enemy body:** [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] - They're growing their chain downward.\n- **Score:** 2-3 - We're CLOSE!

Could be their move to chase apples.\n- **DOWN (2,1):** EMPTY! But there's an apple at (1,1) nearby.\n- **LEFT (1,2):** EMPTY! Moving toward left edge.\n- **RIGHT (3,2):** That's their own body! DEAD MOVE.\n\nThey're likely to go UP to (2,3) or DOWN to (2,1) to chase the apples in the bottom-left quadrant. They're far from us\u2014over in the 0-3 x-range. They're not contesting our area!\n\n**OUR OPTIONS FROM (6,6):**\n\n**UP to (6,7)** - \ud83d\udfe1 TIGHT BUT WORKING!\n- (6,7) is SAFE - empty!\n- Brings us closer to the apple at (7,7)!\n- From there we can go RIGHT to (7,7) next turn and eat!\n- Only 1 move down (to (6,6)) before hitting our own body.\n- **GOOD OPTION!** Sets up the next apple!\n\n**DOWN to (6,5)** - \ud83d\udfe1 SAFE BUT...\n- (6,5) is SAFE - empty!\n- But we're moving AWAY from the (7,7) apple!\n- From (6,5) we can go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5) or RIGHT to (7,5).\n- We lose momentum toward the top-right apples.\n- **NOT IDEAL** - we just ate to grow, now we need to use that growth!\n\n**LEFT to (5,6)** - \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 PERFECT PLAY! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- (5,6) is our OLD body position! It's now empty since we moved away last turn.\n- SAFE! And it keeps us in the same area.\n- **BUT WAIT!** The apple at (7,7) is just 2 moves away! From (5,6) we can go RIGHT to (6,6) (our old spot), then RIGHT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7)... that's 3 moves! Too slow!\n- **ACTUALLY...** from (5,6) we can go RIGHT to (6,6) then UP to (6,7) then RIGHT to (7,7)... that's also 3 moves!\n- **BUT THE REAL REASON:** Going LEFT means we DON'T eat an apple this turn! We need to close the 2-3 gap! Every turn we don't eat is a turn snake #0 might eat!\n\n**RIGHT to (7,6)** - \ud83d\udd25 PERFECT PLAY! \ud83d\udd25\n- (7,6) is SAFE - empty!\n- **This is the KEY!** From (7,6) we're ONE move away from the apple at (7,7)!\n- Next turn we go UP to (7,7) and EAT! That ties the score at 3-3!\n- From (7,6) we have options: UP to (7,7) (apple), DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6).\n- We're dominating the right side of the board!\n- **THIS IS AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** We're taking control!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nWe're 2-3! We need to keep the pressure on! Going RIGHT to (7,6) positions us perfectly to eat the (7,7) apple NEXT TURN! The enemy is stuck in the bottom-left\u2014they're not contesting the top-right quadrant. We're controlling the board! \n\nIf we go UP or DOWN, we waste time. If we go LEFT, we lose momentum. RIGHT is the ONLY move that keeps us on the path to eating an apple every few turns!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nAfter moving to (7,6), we'll be at (7,6) with body [(6,6), (5,6)]. Next turn we go UP to (7,7) and eat that apple! Then we'll be at 3-3 and can pivot to chase other apples while keeping the enemy boxed in the bottom-left. We need to maintain control of the right side\u2014cut off their escape routes if they try to climb up!\n\n**FINAL CALL:** RIGHT to position for the (7,7) apple! We're hunting, not hiding! Let's close this gap! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

We're tied 3-3 with Snake #0, but we need to stay AGGRESSIVE and dominate this board! \n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **Our head:** (7,7) - We just ate that apple last turn! Body: [(7,6), (6,6), (5,6)] (Note: We grew by 1, so body length is now 4)\n- **Enemy head:** (0,2) - Bottom-left corner, body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]\n- **Score:** 3-3 - TIED! We need to push for the lead!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nFrom my head at (7,7), looking at the apples:\n- (6,7) - EMPTY! Safe move\n- (8,7) - EMPTY! Safe move  \n- (7,8) - EMPTY! Safe move\n- (7,6) - Our own body! That's backwards into our tail - DEADLY!\n- (6,8) - (potential apple location? Not in list)\n- (8,8) - (potential apple location? Not in list)\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Turn 9):**\nSnake #0 at (0,2) is still in the bottom-left. They're likely chasing apples at (1,1), (1,0), or (2,4). They'll probably move UP to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2). They're SO far from us - no head-on collision threat!\n\n**OUR OPTIONS FROM (7,7):**\n\n**UP to (7,8)** - \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 PERFECT! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- SAFE! Empty cell, no body, no enemy\n- MOVES US CLOSER to apples at (6,8) or (8,8) if they spawn\n- KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN! From (7,8) we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- MAINTAINS BOARD CONTROL! We're in the upper-middle, ready to chase ANY apple\n- **THIS IS AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!**\n\n**DOWN to (7,6)** - \ud83d\udd34 HELL NO!\n- That's our own body! Backwards into (7,6) = **DEAD!** \ud83d\ude35\n- Never move backwards into yourself!\n\n**LEFT to (6,7)** - \ud83d\udfe1 SAFE BUT...\n- Empty cell, no issue\n- BUT... moves us left toward the edge and closer to potential enemy invasion routes\n- From (6,7) our options are limited: UP(6,8), DOWN(6,6), RIGHT(7,7)\n- **LESS FLEXIBLE!** We'd be building a \"wall\" with our body behind us\n- Not aggressive enough!\n\n**RIGHT to (8,7)** - \ud83d\udfe1 ALSO SAFE BUT...\n- Empty cell, safe\n- BUT... moves us right toward the eastern edge (x=9 is border)\n- From (8,7) we'd be getting closer to the edge with fewer escape routes\n- **DEFENSIVE!** Not our style!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n**UP to (7,8)** is the CLEAR WINNER! We need to stay CENTRAL and AGGRESSIVE. The enemy is stuck in the bottom-left while we control the upper-middle. We're not running to edges - we're claiming the territory!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep your head up and eyes scanning for apples. We want to create a \"zone of control\" in the upper half while the enemy is trapped below. If they try to climb up, we cut them off. Every apple we eat is another level of aggression! Next turn, we'll reassess from (7,8) based on where apples drop and where the enemy is trying to move.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP to claim our territory and stay on the attack! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

They're probably going UP for that apple!\n\n**CHECKING MY OPTIONS FROM (8,8):**\n- **UP to (8,9):** EMPTY! There's an apple there! (8,9) is on the board! This is a safe move that gets me an apple and grows me!\n- **DOWN to (8,7):** EMPTY! But no apple there. Safe though.\n- **LEFT to (7,8):** This is where I came from! Is it empty now? Let me check... My body was [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6)] before moving RIGHT. After moving RIGHT to (8,8), my tail moves forward, so (7,8) should be EMPTY now! This is safe.\n- **RIGHT to (9,8):** That's outside! DEAD!

I get to 4 apples, tie the enemy at 4-4! And from (8,9), I'll have options DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), and RIGHT would be off-board (dead). I'll still have 2 good moves.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEAT THE APPLE! Get to 4-4 tie! Then I need to watch where the enemy goes. If they ate (1,5) or whatever apple they're going for, we're still tied. I need to then position to either cut them off or find more apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the apple at (8,9), then sweep down the right side. The enemy is on the left with that apple cluster at (1,5), (0,8), etc. I need to control the right side and maybe intercept them if they try to cross the center.\n\n**THE MOVE:** UP to (8,9) - EAT THAT APPLE!\n\nUP",

It minimizes risky head-on opportunities since he\u2019s out of reach for now.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (NEXT FEW TURNS):\n- Turn 12: Move UP to (1,5) and eat; push to 5 apples vs 4.\n- Turn 13: If safe, continue UP to (1,6) to keep the edge; else pivot to (0,5) or (2,5) to bait him toward center.\n- Maintain left-edge confinement; only initiate head-on if you have a clear safety window with a comfortable lead.\n- Constantly monitor enemy head; avoid self-traps; be ready to swing toward the center to dodge a chase if he overextends.\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board like a hawk.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (8, 9) \u2013 Top-right corner! Just ate the apple there last turn (hence the A turned into 1 on the board? Actually, the board shows a '1' at (9,9)? Wait no, the board shows: \"9 . . . . . . . . 1 .\" So (9,9) is where the '1' is? That's MY head! Yes! (8,9) is my head. The '1' at (9,9) is likely my body segment. Let's map it.\n- My body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]\n- Enemy head: (1, 4). Enemy body: [(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]\n\n**BOARD SCAN (from visual):**\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . . . . 1 .` -> (9,9) is '1' (my body? or head?). Wait, my head is at (8,9). The coordinate (9,9) is to my RIGHT. The '1' there is likely my body. Actually, looking at the board, '1' usually denotes my snake. '0' denotes enemy. 'T' is tail? 'A' is apple. '.' is empty.\nLet's look at my position based on the board:\nRow 9 (y=9): `9 . . . . . . . . 1 .`\nx=0 to 9: (0,9)=., (1,9)=., (2,9)=., (3,9)=., (4,9)=., (5,9)=., (6,9)=., (7,9)=., (8,9)=1, (9,9)=.\nWait, the '1' is at index 8? No, indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\nThe string is: \". . . . . . . . 1 .\" (9 characters plus the row label? No, it's 10 characters for x=0 to 9).\nLet's count carefully.\n\"9 . . . . . . . . 1 .\"\nThe dots are dots. The '1' is likely my head or body.\nMy head is at (8,9). So (8,9) should be '1'.\nLooking at the string: \nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: .\nIndex 3: .\nIndex 4: .\nIndex 5: .\nIndex 6: .\nIndex 7: .\nIndex 8: 1\nIndex 9: .\nYes, (8,9) is '1'. (9,9) is empty '.'.\nMy body occupies (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nCheck board:\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\n(8,8) should be 'T' (tail?) or body. The board shows 'T' at x=7, x=8? \" . . . T T\"\nIndices: 0: A, 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: A, 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: T, 9: T.\nWait, (8,8) is x=8. The 'T' is at x=8 and x=9? No, look: ` . . . T T`\nIf x=7 is the first dot, x=8 is second dot? No, let's map it:\nRow 8 string: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nLet's write out coordinates:\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nWait, that's 10 items? 0-9.\n0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:T, 9:T.\nMy body is (8,8). The board shows 'T' at x=8? Yes.\nMy body is (7,8). The board shows 'T' at x=7? Yes, x=7 is '.'? No, x=7 is index 7. The string shows '.' at index 7. \" . . . T T\" is indices 6, 7, 8, 9? No.\nLet's look at the row again: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nMaybe I'm miscounting the spaces.\nPositions:\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nWait, the string ends with a dot? \" . . . T T .\"? No, it says `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nLet's count the characters: A (1), . (2), . (3), . (4), A (5), . (6), . (7), . (8), T (9), T (10), . (11)? No, that's too many.\nMaybe the visual is:\n`8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nLet's assume standard 10 chars.\nIf x=0: A\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: A\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: .\nx=8: T\nx=9: .\nWait, the string says `T T .` at the end.\nMaybe x=7: T, x=8: T, x=9: .\nMy body is (8,8) and (7,8). So (7,8) is x=7, y=8. (8,8) is x=8, y=8.\nThe board shows T at (7,8) and T at (8,8)? Or (8,8) and (9,8)?\nLet's look at the description: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head... last one is the tail.\"\nMy snake: Head (8,9). Body [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)].\nSo (8,8) is adjacent to head. (7,8) is next. (7,7) next. (7,6) is tail.\nOn the board at y=8:\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nLet's check coordinates for 'T':\nIf (8,8) is 'T', then x=8 should be T.\nIf (7,8) is 'T', then x=7 should be T.\nIf (7,7) is 'T', that's row 7, x=7.\nIf (7,6) is 'T', that's row 6, x=7.\nLet's check row 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nIndices:\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nThis implies (7,8) is T (x=7) and (8,8) is T (x=8)? No, (7,8) is x=7, (8,8) is x=8.\nWait, my body list: (8,8) is first, then (7,8). So (8,8) is directly connected to head. (7,8) is next.\nSo (8,8) and (7,8) should be marked.\nRow 8 shows T at x=8 and T at x=9? No, \"T T .\" usually means x=7, x=8, x=9? Or x=8, x=9?\nLet's count the characters in the string `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nIt has 11 characters (including the row label? No, the label is separate).\nThe row label is \"8 \".\nThen \"A . . A . . . T T .\"\nThat's A, ., ., A, ., ., ., T, T, .\nThat's 10 characters.\nIndices 0-9.\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nSo (7,8) is x=7, which is index 7. The board shows '.' at index 7. This is a problem.\nWait, maybe my eyes deceive me. ` . . . T T .`\nThe dots are spaces? No, '.' is empty.\nLet's look closer at the text provided:\n\"9 . . . . . . . . 1 .\"\n\"8 A . . A . . . T T .\"\n\"7 . . . . . . A T . .\"\n\"6 . . . . . . . T . A\"\n\"5 . A . . . . . . . .\"\n\"4 . 0 A . . . . . . .\"\n\"3 T T . . . . . A . A\"\n\"2 T T . . . . . . . A\"\n\"1 . A . . . . A . . .\"\n\"0 . A . . A . A . A .\"\n\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nLet's map x=0 to x=9:\nx=0: A\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: A\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: .\nx=8: T\nx=9: T\nWait, my body at (7,8) is x=7. The board shows '.' at x=7.\nMy body at (8,8) is x=8. The board shows 'T' at x=8.\nWhere is (7,8)? The board shows '.' at (7,8).\nIs it possible that (7,8) is not marked 'T'?\nMaybe 'T' marks the tail? No, the prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL... last one is the tail.\" and \"T\" is usually used for tails in these ASCII representations, but often for the whole body.\nLet's check Row 7: `7 . . . . . . A T . .`\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: A\nx=7: T\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\nMy body has (7,7). This is x=7, y=7. The board shows 'T' at x=7. Correct.\nRow 6: `6 . . . . . . . T . A`\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: T\nx=8: .\nx=9: A\nMy body has (7,6). x=7, y=6. Board shows 'T'. Correct.\n\nSo back to Row 8.\nMy body has (7,8) and (8,8).\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nIndices:\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nSo (7,8) (x=7) is '.'.\n(8,8) (x=8) is 'T'.\n(9,8) (x=9) is 'T'.\nWait, (9,8) is not in my body list. My body is (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nWhy is there a 'T' at (9,8)?\nMaybe the 'T' at x=9 is actually (8,8)?\nIf x=8 is (7,8) and x=9 is (8,8)?\nMy head is at (8,9).\nMy body is (8,8) (adjacent to head).\n(8,8) is directly below (8,9).\nSo (8,8) should be x=8, y=8.\nThe board shows (8,8) is 'T'.\nThe board shows (7,8) is '.'.\nThe board shows (9,8) is 'T'.\nThis is inconsistent with my body list [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)].\nUNLESS... the 'T' at x=9 is a mistake in my reading or the board is shifted?\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nMaybe the spacing is weird. `T T .` could be at x=6,7,8? No.\nLet's trust the text explicitly.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n8 A . . A . . . T T .\nSo:\n(0,8)=A\n(1,8)=.\n(2,8)=.\n(3,8)=.\n(4,8)=A\n(5,8)=.\n(6,8)=.\n(7,8)=.\n(8,8)=T\n(9,8)=T\n\nMy body: (8,8) and (7,8).\nSo (8,8) is T (Correct).\n(7,8) is . (Incorrect, should be T or part of body).\nWait, is it possible that (7,8) is NOT part of my body?\n\"Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]\"\nYes, (7,8) is definitely in the list.\nWhy is it empty on the board?\nMaybe the board updates *after* the move? No, the board state is current.\nMaybe I'm misinterpreting the board's 'T'?\nUsually, 'T' means tail. But here it seems to mark the body.\nIf (9,8) is 'T' and not in my list... that's a ghost segment?\nOr maybe the visual is slightly off due to monospacing?\nLet's assume the board is correct and my list is correct.\n(7,8) is listed in my body.\n(7,8) is shown as empty on board.\nIf (7,8) is empty, it means I can move into it?\nBut it IS my body.\nThis implies the board display is slightly inaccurate or I'm misaligning columns.\nHowever, I must trust the coordinates given in the text over the ASCII art if they conflict, but the ASCII art is the \"current board state\".\nLet's look at the enemy.\nEnemy head (1,4). Enemy body [(1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)].\nRow 4: `4 . 0 A . . . . . . .`\n(1,4) is '0'. Correct.\nRow 3: `3 T T . . . . . A . A`\n(1,3) should be 'T'. x=1, y=3. Board shows 'T'. Correct.\n(0,3) should be 'T'. x=0, y=3. Board shows 'T'. Correct.\nRow 2: `2 T T . . . . . . . A`\n(0,2) should be 'T'. x=0, y=2. Board shows 'T'. Correct.\n(1,2) should be 'T'. x=1, y=2. Board shows 'T'. Correct.\nSo enemy board mapping is perfect.\nMy board mapping for (7,8) is off.\n(7,8) is likely 'T' but displayed as '.' or I'm miscounting.\nLet's count the characters in row 8 string carefully.\n`8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nA (1) . (2) . (3) A (4) . (5) . (6) . (7) T (8) T (9) . (10)?\nThat's 10 items.\nIndices 0 to 9.\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: T\n9: T\nIf (7,8) is x=7, index 7 is '.'.\nIf (8,8) is x=8, index 8 is 'T'.\nIf (9,8) is x=9, index 9 is 'T'.\nThis means there is a 'T' at (9,8) which is NOT in my body list.\nIs it possible that my tail is actually at (9,8)?\nMy body list: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)].\nThe last one is the tail: (7,6).\nSo (7,6) is the tail.\nWhere is (7,6) on the board?\nRow 6: `6 . . . . . . . T . A`\nx=7 is 'T'. Correct.\nSo the tail is correct.\nWhy is (9,8) a 'T'?\nMaybe it's a visual artifact? Or a bug in the display?\nOR, maybe my body actually wraps differently?\nNo, the list is explicit.\nOkay, I will trust the coordinates of my body.\nMy body occupies: (8,9) Head, (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nI cannot move into (8,8) or (7,8) or (7,7) or (7,6).\nI can move into (9,9), (8,9) is current.\nMoves from (8,9):\n- UP: (8,10) - OFF BOARD. DEAD.\n- DOWN: (8,8) - MY BODY. DEAD.\n- LEFT: (7,9) - IS IT EMPTY?\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . . . . 1 .`\nx=7, y=9.\nRow 9: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:1, 9:.\nSo (7,9) is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) - IS IT EMPTY?\nRow 9, x=9: '.' (empty). Safe.\nWait, (9,9) is empty.\nBut is it really empty? My body is at (8,8) and (7,8).\nIs it possible (9,9) is occupied by the enemy? No, enemy is at x=1 range.\nIs it possible (9,9) is an apple? The apple list: (1,5), (9,2), (9,6), (1,0), (0,8), (4,0), (2,4), (1,1), (6,0), (9,3), (8,0), (6,1), (7,3), (6,7), (3,8).\nNo apple at (9,9).\nSo (9,9) is empty.\n\nSo valid moves: LEFT to (7,9), RIGHT to (9,9).\n\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (9,9), I'm moving to (9,9).\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9), I'm moving to (7,9).\n\nAre there any apples near?\nApple at (9,6) is below. (9,2) is below.\nApple at (0,8) is far left.\nApple at (3,8) is left.\nApple at (6,7) is left/down.\nApple at (7,3) is left/down.\nApple at (8,0) is bottom right.\n\nI need to box the enemy in.\nEnemy is at (1,4). Body at (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2).\nThere is an apple at (1,5) above the enemy head.\nThere is an apple at (0,8) top left.\nThere is an apple at (3,8) top left.\nThere is an apple at (1,0) bottom left.\nThere is an apple at (2,4) near enemy.\n\nEnemy has 4 apples. I have 4 apples.\nI need to grow.\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9), I am closer to (0,8) and (3,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9), I am in the corner.\n(9,9) is a dangerous corner. If I go into (9,9), I have only 1 move next turn (LEFT to (8,9)).\n(8,9) is my current position.\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9), I have more options.\nFrom (7,9): UP (7,10) off board. LEFT (6,9). RIGHT (8,9). DOWN (7,8) is my body.\nSo (7,9) is also a corner-ish spot but better than (9,9).\nWait, (7,9): x=7, y=9.\nNeighbors: (7,8) is body. (6,9) is empty (Row 9, x=6 is '.'). (8,9) is current (will be empty after move? No, I'm moving from there). (7,10) off board.\nSo from (7,9) I can go LEFT to (6,9) or BACK to (8,9).\nThat's 2 options.\n\nWhat about (9,9)?\nNeighbors: (9,8) is... empty? Or 'T'?\nRow 8, x=9 is 'T'.\nWait, (9,8) is 'T'.\nIs (9,8) my body?\nMy body: (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\n(9,8) is NOT in my body list.\nSo (9,8) is safe? Or is it the enemy?\nEnemy is far away.\nSo (9,8) is likely empty (the 'T' in the board is likely a display error for (8,8) or something, or it's just a visual artifact).\nLet's assume (9,8) is empty.\nIf I go to (9,9):\nI can go DOWN to (9,8) (safe?).\nI can go LEFT to (8,9) (safe?).\nI cannot go UP or RIGHT.\nSo (9,9) offers 2 moves as well: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nComparison:\nOption A: LEFT to (7,9).\nLeaves me at x=7, y=9.\nOptions: LEFT (6,9), RIGHT (8,9).\nOption B: RIGHT to (9,9).\nLeaves me at x=9, y=9.\nOptions: DOWN (9,8), LEFT (8,9).\n\nStrategically, where is the enemy?\nEnemy is at (1,4).\nApples:\n(9,6) - Bottom right. (9,2) - Bottom right.\n(8,0) - Bottom right.\n(6,7) - Mid right.\n(0,8) - Top left.\n(3,8) - Top left.\n(2,4) - Near enemy.\n(1,5) - Above enemy.\n(1,0) - Bottom left.\n(4,0) - Bottom mid.\n(6,0) - Bottom right.\n\nIf I go to (9,9), I am committed to the right side.\nIf I go to (7,9), I am slightly more central but still right side.\nHowever, (9,9) is the extreme corner.\nWait, (9,8) is marked 'T' on the board.\nIf (9,8) is indeed occupied (by a ghost segment or error), moving to (9,9) might trap me.\nBut if it's empty, it's fine.\nHowever, the board explicitly shows `T` at (9,8).\nIn Snake games, 'T' usually means Tail. But my tail is at (7,6).\nCould there be a mistake in the body list provided vs the board?\n\"Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]\"\nMaybe the body is actually (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7)?\nNo, the list is given as fact.\nI must trust the list.\nThe board is a visual representation.\nIf the board shows a 'T' at (9,8) that shouldn't be there, it's a visual error.\nBUT, if I move to (9,9), I rely on (9,8) being clear to have an exit.\nIf (9,8) is NOT clear (even if it shouldn't be), I might be stuck.\nActually, if (9,8) is blocked, I can go LEFT to (8,9).\nFrom (9,9), I can go LEFT to (8,9).\nFrom (8,9), I can go LEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8).\nBut (8,8) is my body.\nSo from (9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9) is the path.\nThat's fine.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nEnemy head (1,4). Body (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2).\nApples around: (1,5) is UP. (2,4) is RIGHT. (1,0) is DOWN.\nEnemy will likely go for (1,5) or (2,4).\nIf enemy goes UP to (1,5), they eat an apple and grow.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,4), they might be setting up for (3,8) or (6,7)? No, too far.\n(2,4) is empty currently.\nIf enemy goes UP, they might trap themselves in the top left corner eventually.\nTop left has apples: (0,8), (3,8).\nI am on the right side.\nMy goal is to dominate the right side and cut off the center.\n\nLet's evaluate moves:\n1. LEFT to (7,9):\n   - Safe? Yes (empty on board).\n   - Next moves: (6,9) and (8,9).\n   - (6,9) is empty.\n   - This keeps me away from the corner.\n   - This allows me to access (6,7) and (8,0) eventually.\n\n2. RIGHT to (9,9):\n   - Safe? Yes (empty on board).\n   - Next moves: (9,8) and (8,9).\n   - (9,8) shows 'T' on board. Risky? Possibly a visual bug.\n   - If (9,8) is blocked, I am forced to (8,9).\n   - (8,9) -> (7,9) or (8,8) blocked.\n   - So I'd go (9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9).\n   - This is a bit of a bottleneck.\n   - However, (9,9) is a corner. Corners are death traps in Snake unless you have a long tail.\n   - I am length 5. Not very long.\n   - If I go to (9,9), I have limited space to maneuver if the enemy comes down or if I need to dodge.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (1,4). They are far.\nThere are apples on the right:\n(9,6)\n(9,2)\n(8,0)\n(6,7)\n(6,1)\n(7,3)\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9), I am closer to (6,7) and (6,1) etc.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9), I am close to (9,6) and (9,2).\n\nIf I want to box the enemy in, I need to control the center.\nThe center is around (4,4).\nI am at x=8.\nThe enemy is at x=1.\nThere is a gap in the middle.\nI should probably move towards the center to prevent the enemy from expanding.\nHowever, apples are on the edges.\n(3,8) is close to me if I go LEFT.\n(0,8) is far.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . . . . 1 .`\nRow 8: `8 A . . A . . . T T .`\nRow 7: `7 . . . . . . A T . .`\nRow 6: `6 . . . . . . . T . A`\n\nThere is an apple at (6,7).\nThere is an apple at (9,6).\nThere is an apple at (9,2).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9):\nI am at (7,9).\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8) (blocked).\nSo effectively only (6,9).\nFrom (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8), etc.\nThis path leads to (6,7) apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9):\nI am at (9,9).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (9,8) or LEFT to (8,9).\n(9,8) is marked T. If blocked, I go LEFT.\nFrom (8,9), I can go LEFT (7,9) or DOWN (8,8 blocked).\nSo (8,9) -> (7,9).\nThis path is slower to get to (6,7).\n\nHowever, (9,9) is a corner.\nIn Snake, corners are dangerous because you can get boxed in.\nWith a length of 5, I have some flexibility.\nBut being in the corner limits my future moves to 2 directions.\nBeing at (7,9) also limits me to 2 directions (left and right, up is blocked).\n(7,9) is slightly better because (6,9) is open.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (7,9)? No.\nIs there an apple at (9,9)? No.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy head (1,4).\nIf enemy goes UP to (1,5) (apple), they grow.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,4) (empty).\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (1,3) (body).\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (0,4) (empty? Row 4: `4 . 0 A ...` x=0 is '.').\nSo enemy can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (1,5), they are in the top left area.\nI am in the top right.\nWe are converging on the top edge maybe?\nApples at (3,8) and (0,8) are top edge.\n\nMy plan:\nI need to secure the right side apples.\n(9,6), (9,2), (8,0), (6,7), (7,3), (6,1).\nBy going LEFT to (7,9), I can sweep down the right side (x=6,7,8,9).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9), I am committed to x=9, then I have to loop back.\nLooping back from x=9 to x=8 is fine, but x=9 is the wall.\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9), I can weave between x=6 and x=9.\n\nLet's check coordinates again.\n(7,9) is safe.\n(9,9) is safe.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nThe enemy is far.\nMy tail is at (7,6).\nWhen I move, my tail will move forward.\nCurrent body: (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nIf I move LEFT to (7,9):\nNew head: (7,9).\nNew body: (7,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nTail (7,6) moves? No, if I don't eat an apple, the tail leaves (7,6) and moves to (7,7).\nSo (7,6) becomes empty.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,9):\nNew head: (9,9).\nNew body: (9,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\nTail (7,6) becomes empty.\n\nComparison:\nLEFT to (7,9):\n- Position: (7,9).\n- Safe moves next turn: (6,9) and (8,9).\n- I am moving towards (6,7) apple.\n- I am moving towards (3,8) apple.\n- I am centralizing slightly.\n\nRIGHT to (9,9):\n- Position: (9,9).\n- Safe moves next turn: (9,8) and (8,9).\n- (9,8) is visually 'T'. If it's actually occupied, I only have (8,9).\n- (8,9) leads to (7,9).\n- This path is \"right wall hug\".\n- Apples: (9,6) is below. (9,2) is below.\n\nWhich is better?\nIf I go RIGHT, I get closer to (9,6) and (9,2).\nIf I go LEFT, I get closer to (6,7) and (3,8).\nThe enemy is at x=1.\nIf I control x=6-9, I dominate 40% of the board width.\nIf I go to x=7, I still dominate x=6-9.\n(7,9) seems more flexible than (9,9).\n(9,9) is a hard corner.\n(7,9) is a \"soft\" corner (only blocked on one side).\n\nWait, look at the board.\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . . . . 1 .`\nThe '1' is at (8,9).\nThe dots are at (0,8) to (7,9) and (9,9).\nSo (6,9) is empty.\n(7,9) is empty.\n(8,9) is occupied (me).\n(9,9) is empty.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9):\nI vacate (8,9).\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (6,9).\n(6,9) is empty.\nFrom (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8).\nRow 8, x=6 is '.'.\nRow 7, x=6 is 'A' (apple at (6,7)).\nSo from (6,8) -> (6,7) EAT APPLE.\nThis is a solid plan.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9):\nI vacate (8,9).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (9,8).\nRow 8, x=9 is 'T'.\nIs (9,8) safe?\nIt's marked 'T'. It shouldn't be my body.\nIt might be safe (visual error).\nBut if it's safe, I go to (9,8).\nFrom (9,8), I can go DOWN to (9,7).\nRow 7, x=9 is '.'.\nFrom (9,7), I can go DOWN to (9,6) EAT APPLE.\nThis is also a solid plan.\n\nBoth paths lead to an apple.\nPath 1 (Left): (7,9) -> (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7). 3 turns to apple.\nPath 2 (Right): (9,9) -> (9,8) -> (9,7) -> (9,6). 3 turns to apple.\n\nHowever, Path 2 involves (9,8) which is visually blocked.\nIf (9,8) is blocked, I cannot go DOWN.\nI would be forced to go LEFT to (8,9).\nThen (8,9) -> (7,9) -> (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7).\nThat adds a turn.\nPath 2 becomes (9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9) -> (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7). 5 turns to apple.\nPath 1 is definitely 3 turns to apple.\n\nAlso, Path 1 allows me to access (3,8) and (0,8) later.\nPath 2 locks me to the right wall.\nIf I eat (9,6), I am at x=9, y=6.\nFrom there, I can go LEFT to (8,6) or UP to (9,7) or DOWN to (9,5).\n(9,5) is empty (Row 5: `5 . A ...` x=9 is '.').\n(8,6) is empty (Row 6: `6 ... T . A` x=8 is '.').\nIt's doable.\n\nBut the \"boxed in\" warning.\nI should avoid getting trapped.\nAt (9,9), I am trapped on the right.\nAt (7,9), I am not trapped. I have the whole right side.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy.\nIf I stay at (9,9), I am far from the enemy.\nIf I go to (7,9), I am slightly closer, but still far.\nThe enemy is likely to stay left or move center.\nI need to eat apples to grow.\nMy score is 4-4.\nI need to take the lead.\nEating (6,7) or (9,6) gives me the lead.\n(6,7) is safer to access from (7,9) because of the visual 'T' at (9,8).\n\nWait, could the 'T' at (9,8) be the enemy?\nEnemy is at (1,4).\nCould the enemy have moved there?\nNo, this is the board state at Turn 12. Enemy is at (1,4).\nThe 'T' at (9,8) is likely my own body segment that is misaligned or the board is slightly wrong.\nBUT, if I rely on it being empty and it's not, I die.\nIf I rely on it being blocked and it's empty, I just play slightly more conservative.\nConservatism suggests avoiding the suspicious 'T'.\n\nAlso, strategy: \"box him in\".\nIf I take the center/left-center (x=3-5), I can block him.\nBut there are no apples there.\nThe apples are at the edges: (3,8) (left), (6,7) (right), (9,6) (right).\nI am already on the right.\nI should commit to the right side.\nTaking (7,9) is committing to the right side.\nTaking (9,9) is committing to the *extreme* right side.\n(7,9) is better positioning.\n\nLet's check if there are any apples closer?\n(8,0) is bottom right.\n(7,3) is mid right.\n(6,1) is bottom right.\n(6,7) is mid right.\n(9,6) is mid right.\n\nI will go LEFT to (7,9).\nWhy?\n1. Avoids the visual 'T' at (9,8).\n2. Positions me better to sweep the right side (x=6 to 9) rather than just x=9.\n3. Allows access to (6,7) easily.\n4. Keeps me out of the corner.\n\nNext move from (7,9) will likely be LEFT to (6,9) to set up for (6,7).\n\nWait, is there any risk in moving LEFT?\n(7,9) is empty.\n(6,9) is empty.\n(5,9) is empty.\nIt's safe.\n\nWhat about UP?\n(8,9) -> UP is (8,10) off board.\n(7,9) -> UP is (7,10) off board.\nSo no UP.\n\nWhat about DOWN?\n(8,9) -> DOWN is (8,8) (my body).\n(7,9) -> DOWN is (7,8) (my body).\nSo no DOWN.\n\nSo I must go LEFT or RIGHT.\nLeft seems strategically superior.\n\nOne detail: \"box him in\".\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the center.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away.\nMoving towards the center allows me to potentially cut him off later if he tries to cross.\nIf I go RIGHT, he has the whole left side and center.\n\nAlso, look at the apples at (3,8) and (0,8).\nThese are in the top left.\nThe enemy is at (1,4).\nIf the enemy goes UP, he can get those.\nI cannot reach them easily from the right.\nBut I don't need to.\nI just need to outgrow him.\nI can eat the right side apples: (6,7), (9,6), (8,0), (7,3), (6,1).\nThat's 5 apples.\nI have 4. He has 4.\nIf I eat 3 of these, I win.\n\nLet's confirm the move LEFT.\nFrom (8,9) to (7,9).\nIs (7,9) safe?\nYes, board shows '.'.\nIs it safe from enemy collision?\nEnemy is at (1,4). Distance is huge.\nIs it safe from my body?\nMy body is at (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).\n(7,9) is not in my body.\n\nFinal check:\nMove LEFT to (7,9).\nNext turn options: (6,9) and (8,9).\n(8,9) will be empty (I'm leaving it).\n(6,9) is empty.\nThis keeps my options open.\n\nIf I went RIGHT to (9,9):\nNext turn options: (9,8) and (8,9).\n(9,8) is suspicious.\n(8,9) is safe.\nBut (9,9) is a corner.\nCorners are bad.\nLeft is better.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (8,9). I need to grow and control the board.\nThe enemy is far away at (1,4).\nI see an apple at (6,7) and (9,6) on the right.\nThe board shows a 'T' at (9,8), which is suspicious and might block a path if I go to (9,9).\nGoing LEFT to (7,9) avoids the corner and the potential blockage.\nIt positions me to head towards (6,7) via (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7).\nThis path seems clear.\nBy moving LEFT, I maintain flexibility and move towards a cluster of apples on the right side.\nI will secure the right side apples to increase my score and dominate the board.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nFrom (7,9), likely move LEFT to (6,9) to set up for the apple at (6,7).\nOr if the enemy makes a move that changes things, I can react.\nBut for now, LEFT is the safe, aggressive play to secure resources.\n\nI must output only the direction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought_process\": \"I am at (8,9).

Turn 12 and we're tied 4-4! Let's analyze this board like a hawk. The enemy is way over at (1,4) on the left side, so I've got breathing room to make a power play.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (8, 9) - Top right corner.\n- **Board State:** There's a suspicious 'T' marking at (9, 8) on the board. If I go **RIGHT** to (9, 9), I'm boxing myself into the corner. If that 'T' is actually an obstacle (or even just a visual glitch that represents a blocked space), I'd be trapped with only one way out (back left). That's a classic trap, CHAT!\n- **Enemy:** Stuck on the far left. I need to secure the right side apples before he expands.\n\n**MY MOVE:**\nI'm choosing **LEFT** to (7, 9).\n- **Why?** It keeps me out of the corner and opens up the path to the apple at (6, 7). From (7, 9), I can move to (6, 9) next turn, setting up a direct line to eat and grow.\n- **Aggression:** By moving left towards the center/right-side apples, I'm dominating the upper half of the board and cutting off any potential route the enemy might have to cross over later.\n- **Safety:** (7, 9) is empty and confirmed safe. No immediate collision risks.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (6, 7) by moving (7,9) -> (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7). Once I eat, I'll sweep down the right side for the other apples ((9,6), (8,0), etc.) to take the lead. Keep the enemy pinned on the left!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down the battlefield.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 is still lurking on the left side at (1, 5). He's growing faster than us (5 apples vs 4), so we NEED to close this gap. If we keep our distance, he'll just rack up points. We need to box him in or force a collision.\n\n**MY POSITION:**\nHead at (7, 9). I just moved LEFT from (8, 9). Why? Because moving RIGHT to (9, 9) was a trap. It's a corner. If I eat an apple there and grow, I block myself. If the enemy rushes right (unlikely but possible), I'd be dead. We avoid corners unless we're cornering *him*.\n\n**BOARD SCAN:**\n- **Center/Open Space:** The middle of the board is relatively clear. I can maneuver here.\n- **The Threat:** The enemy is at (1, 5). To force a head-on collision, I need to close the distance. However, with a score of 4 vs 5, I **cannot** engage in a head-on collision. I would lose. I must get to 5 apples (or more) before we box him in.\n- **Apples:** There are apples scattered. (6, 7) is close, but blocked by my own tail segment at (7, 7)? Wait, no. (7, 7) is my body. (6, 7) is the apple.\n- **Current Location (7, 9):** If I go UP, I die (wall). If I go LEFT (to 6,9), that's valid. If I go DOWN (to 7,8), that's my body! I'm currently at (7,9). My body is at (7,8), (7,7), etc. So I cannot go DOWN.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI am at (7, 9).\n- **UP:** Impossible (wall). Dead.\n- **DOWN:** (7, 8) is occupied by my own body (the segment behind my head). Dead.\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 9) is empty (I just came from there, but the tail moves too, so it's open). Wait, let's check. My body is currently [(8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. My head is at (7,9). If I move RIGHT to (8,9), I will collide with my own body segment that is currently at (8,9). That is death.\n- **LEFT:** (6, 9) is empty. This is the only safe move.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI **MUST** go **LEFT**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Survival:** It's the only move that doesn't kill me immediately.\n2.  **Strategy:** Moving to (6, 9) keeps me in the game. I am setting up a path to sweep the top row or drop down into the center.\n3.  **Enemy:** The enemy is far away. I need to focus on growing. I am currently at 4 apples. I need to reach 5 to match him, then 6 to beat him. I see an apple at (6, 7). From (6, 9), I can go DOWN to (6, 8), then DOWN to (6, 7) to eat. That's the plan.\n4.  **Score:** I am currently 4-5. I **cannot** force a head-on collision yet. I must grow first.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 9). Next turn, move DOWN to (6, 8). Turn after that, DOWN to (6, 7) to eat the apple. This will level the score to 5-5. Then I can aggressively hunt.\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019ll pick a safe, high-ENG move that keeps future options open and not get boxed in.\n\nSAFE OPTIONS (no death on this turn):\n- UP to (1,6)\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n- RIGHT to (2,5)\n- DOWN is a death trench into our own neck, avoid like a bad joke.\n\nPICKED MOVE AND WHY:\n- I\u2019m going UP to (1,6). It\u2019s the safest, most flexible path that keeps us near the left flank without colliding with our own body. It also sets up a clean continuation along the edge while steadily creeping toward the mid-top area where we can menace him if he overextends.\n\nRATIONALE SNAPSHOT:\n- Avoids self-collision (our neck is at (1,4)).\n- Keeps multiple good follow-ups: continue UP to press the top-left corridor, or pivot to the left or right if he tries a center squeeze.\n- We\u2019re ahead, so a measured press beats a reckless chase. We want to force him into our wall gradually, not dive into a knife fight.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (next few turns):\n- Turn 13: Move UP to (1,6) and keep the edge pressure on the left side.\n- Turn 14: If safe, continue UP to (1,7) to push the vertical edge play; if he freelances toward the center, pivot to (0,6) or (2,6) to stimulate a center squeeze.\n- Turn 15-25: Build a slow, patient edge confinement, watching for any overextension by the enemy. If he attempts a direct head-on while we have a clean safety window and a lead, capitalize on it. Otherwise, clamp him toward the center and force a mid-board collision scenario only if it guarantees survival and a net apple gain.\n\nEMOJI CHECK: stealthy, sharp, and ready to box him in. We\u2019re keeping him in check while we stack apples. LET\u2019S GOOO!\n\nUP",

He's growing, but he's stuck on the far left. I can't force a head-on collision yet because I have 4 apples vs his 5. If we clash now, *I* lose. I need to eat an apple to tie it up (4-5) or get ahead (5-5) before I can get aggressive. He has a clear path upwards to (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), or he could move right to (2, 6). I need to watch his move next turn, but for now, I need to focus on my survival and growth.\n\n**MY POSITION:**\nI am at (6, 9). I just moved LEFT from (7, 9). I am at the top of the board. My body is currently winding through: [(7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8)]. (Technically my tail is at (7,8), but it will move this turn).\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP:** (6, 10). Out of bounds. DEAD. \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** (5, 9). There is an apple there! \ud83c\udf4e \"APPLE DROPS: ... (5, 9)\". If I eat it, I grow and score to 5 apples. Is it safe? My body is at (7,9) and (8,9) etc. (5, 9) is currently empty. The enemy is at (1, 6), nowhere near. However, I need to check for head-on collisions. If the enemy moves to (5, 9) simultaneously, we both die. Is that likely? He's at (1, 6). To reach (5, 9) in one turn is impossible (Manhattan distance is 7). So (5, 9) is safe from him.\n*   **RIGHT:** (7, 9). This is where I just came from. My body is currently at (7, 9) (the segment behind my head). Moving back there is hitting myself. DEAD. \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** (6, 8). Is it occupied? My body currently occupies (8,9), (8,8), (7,8). (6, 8) is currently empty. However, I have to be careful. If I move DOWN, I move toward the center. The apple at (6, 7) is reachable from here. But wait! There is an apple at (5, 9) RIGHT NOW.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI am at (6, 9).\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (5, 9).\nResult: I eat an apple. I grow. My score becomes 5. I tie the enemy (5-5).\nOption 2: Move DOWN to (6, 8).\nResult: I don't eat. I stay at 4 apples. I move closer to (6, 7) apple, but that's two moves away.\n\nWhy is Option 1 better?\n1.  **Score:** I need to match the enemy's score (5) to stand a chance in a head-on collision later. Eating now is priority.\n2.  **Safety:** (5, 9) is confirmed safe from the enemy's current position. It's not a corner (x=5 is not 0 or 9), so I won't be boxed in immediately.\n3.  **Positioning:** From (5, 9), I am still at the top row. I can move DOWN to (5, 8) or LEFT to (4, 9) next turn. I keep options open.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I miss the apple at (5, 9). Someone else might get it? No, only me and snake #0. But I need that point.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **LEFT** to (5, 9).\n1.  Eat the apple. Score 5-5.\n2.  Survive the turn.\n3.  Next turn: Assess the enemy's move. If he moves up/left, I might chase or set a trap. If I'm at (5, 9), I can drop down into the center or sweep the top row.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again.\nBoard:\nRow 9: `. A 1 T T .`\nCoordinates: (0,9) to (9,9).\nMy head is at (6,9).\nApple at (5,9).\n(5,9) is indeed the cell to my left.\n(6,8) is empty.\n(7,9) is occupied by my body (segment 1).\n(5,9) is NOT occupied by my body.\n(5,9) is NOT out of bounds.\n(5,9) is NOT occupied by the enemy.\n\nThe only risk is a simultaneous move head-on collision. The enemy is at (1,6). He cannot reach (5,9). He could potentially move to (2,6), (1,5), (0,6), or (1,7). None of those are (5,9).\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the winning move to gain an apple and tie the score.\n\nLEFT",

We are tied!)\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (5, 9):**\n*   **UP:** (5, 10) -> Out of bounds. DEATH. \u274c\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 9) -> My body is currently at (6, 9). That's a collision. DEATH. \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 8) -> Is it occupied? Board state shows row 8 has an 'A' at (4,8) and (8,8)/(7,8) are my tail. (5, 8) appears empty. This is safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 9) -> Is it occupied? Row 9 shows `.` at (4,9). The only things on row 9 are the apple at (5,9) (which I just ate, so it's gone now), and my tail at (6,9)/(7,9)/(8,9). (4,9) is clear. This is safe.\n\n**THE STRATEGY (LIVE PLANNING):**\nWe are tied 5-5. We need to keep the pressure on. Moving **LEFT** to (4, 9) puts us further into the top-left quadrant.\n1.  **Safety:** (4, 9) is safe from the enemy.\n2.  **Positioning:** It keeps us at the top of the map, giving us high ground.\n3.  **Aggression:** From (4, 9), I can see the apple at (3, 8). The enemy is near (1, 6), but if I swoop down, I can claim that territory.\n4.  **Trap Potential:** By moving left, I'm actually moving *away* from the enemy's direct path, but setting up to cut off his potential expansion upwards. If he goes up to (2,9) eventually, I can meet him there.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n*   **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe, but I lose control of the top row. I become a mid-board snake.\n*   **LEFT (4, 9):** Safe, maintains top row dominance. Sets up for (3, 8) or (4, 8).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm staying on the roof. I need to own this row.\nI will move **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

We need to maintain our position and prepare to hunt him down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1) **Check my current position (4,9) and possible moves:**\n*   **UP:** (4,10) -> Out of bounds (max y=9). **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN:** (4,8) -> Is this safe? My body is at [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)]. (4,8) is NOT in my body. Is it occupied by the enemy? Enemy body is on the left side. Enemy head is (3,6), body is [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. (4,8) is empty. **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT:** (3,9) -> Is this safe? My body is at [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)]. (3,9) is NOT in my body. Is it occupied by the enemy? Enemy body is nowhere near (3,9). (3,9) is empty. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (5,9) -> Is this safe? My body is at [(5,9)...]. YES, (5,9) is my first body segment. Moving into (5,9) is hitting my own body. **DEATH.**\n\n2) **Analyze the SAFE moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n*   **MOVE LEFT to (3,9):**\n    *   *Pros:* Keeps me on the top row (high ground). Allows me to eventually move towards the apple at (3,8) or (0,8). Maintains a clear path to the right side if needed.\n    *   *Cons:* Slightly closer to the left side where the enemy is.\n*   **MOVE DOWN to (4,8):**\n    *   *Pros:* Steps onto row 8. Looking at the board, row 8 has an apple at (4,8)! Looking at the `APPLE DROPS` list, there is indeed an apple at (4,2), but looking at the `BOARD STATE` specifically, row 8 shows `A . . A . . . . . T .`. Wait, checking the board state text again: \"8 A . . A . . . . T .\"\n        *   (0,8) is 'A'\n        *   (1,8) is '.'\n        *   (2,8) is '.'\n        *   (3,8) is 'A'\n        *   (4,8) is '.'\n        *   Wait, looking closer at the ASCII art provided in the prompt:\n            `9 . . . . 1 T T T T .`\n            `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n            Row 8, column 4 is indeed '.' in the drawing.\n    *   Wait, let me re-read the apple list. `(0,8), (4,0)...` No `(4,8)` in the list? The list is: (9, 2), (9, 6), (1, 0), (0, 8), (4, 0), (2, 4), (1, 1), (6, 0), (9, 3), (8, 0), (6, 1), (7, 3), (6, 7), (3, 8), (4, 2).\n    *   The apple at (3,8) IS in the list.\n    *   Looking at the ASCII map again: Row 8 has 'A's at (0,8) and (3,8).\n    *   So moving DOWN to (4,8) does NOT give an apple.\n    *   *Cons:* Leaves the top row. Reduces vision/control of the upper area.\n\n3) **Strategic Assessment:**\nThe enemy is at (3,6). If I move LEFT to (3,9), I am at x=3, y=9. The enemy is at x=3, y=6.\nThis is a vertical alignment. If I stay at (3,9), I can move DOWN next turn to (3,8) (which has an apple!).\nIf I move DOWN now to (4,8), I am one step further away from the apple at (3,8).\nStaying on the top row allows me to cut off the enemy if he tries to go up to the top row (e.g., to x=2 or x=3).\nAlso, checking the enemy's potential moves: Enemy at (3,6). He can go UP to (3,7).\nIf I am at (3,9) and he goes UP to (3,7), we are two tiles apart vertically.\nIf I am at (4,8) and he goes UP to (3,7), we are not directly aligned.\n\n**Tactical Plan:**\nThe apple at (3,8) is very close. Moving LEFT puts me at (3,9). Next turn, I can move DOWN to (3,8) and eat the apple.\nThe enemy is currently at (3,6). He is 2 tiles away from (3,8).\nIf I go to (3,9) now, I can secure the apple next turn before he can reach it, unless he goes UP-UP in one turn (impossible, he's at y=6, needs to reach y=8).\nEven if he goes UP this turn to (3,7), he will be at (3,7) and I will be at (3,9). I will be at the apple (3,8) next turn before him.\n\nLet's double check the board state for obstacles at (3,9).\nRow 9: `. . . . 1 T T T T .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(3,9) is the 4th value (index 3). It is a '.' (dot). Clear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove LEFT to (3,9) is the play. It secures my position on the high ground and sets up a guaranteed apple grab at (3,8) next turn.\n\nLEFT",

OPPONENT: HEAD (3,9) -> (4,9) -> (5,9) -> (6,9) -> (7,9) -> (8,9). Score tied at 5 apples each. Apples are scattering, but our mission is to pressure and cage him in, not just chase fruit.\n\nWhat can we safely do this turn?\n- Safe options (not dying this turn): UP to (3,8) [apple there], LEFT to (2,7), RIGHT to (4,7). DOWN would slam into our own body (3,6) and is a no-go.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning UP (the aggressive bite):\n- It grabs the immediate apple at (3,8), growing us and extending pressure on the top area.\n- It disrupts his potential top-row retreat: if he tries to drop down, we\u2019ll threaten the same square we just moved into, making a potential head-on but with him closer to the edge and us with extra length.\n- It keeps future options open: we\u2019ll still have room to pivot along the 3rd/2nd columns to start a small box near the top, pressuring his path along y=9.\n\nImmediate risk to weigh:\n- If he chooses Down to (3,8) on this turn, we\u2019d collide head-on in that same square and both die; apples would tie 5-5 and the game would end in a draw. It\u2019s a real risk, but that same risk exists for any plan that drives into that top corridor.\n\nLonger-term plan (for the next few turns if we survive this turn):\n- After UP, watch his choice. If he drops to (3,8) and we survive the head-on, we\u2019ll be at (3,8) with a longer body and better control of the vertical column near x=3. From there, use LEFT/UP to push him toward the edge and create a potential trap along the 2nd column and top row.\n- If he retreats to (2,9), we gain a strong foothold near (3,8) to threaten a follow-up move toward (2,9) or (2,8), steadily boxing him in and pinning his options while we continue to eat safe apples to grow advantage.\n\nShort-term tactic:\n- Move UP now to secure the apple at (3,8) and apply pressure on his access to the top edge. We\u2019ll adapt next turn based on his reply, aiming to either convert the top-right area into a bottleneck or force a risky head-on that we can survive with extra length.\n\nDecision: UP\n\nUP",

If I go to (2,9) and he goes to (3,7), we aren't aligned, which is safe. If I go to (2,9) and he goes to (2,7) (if he had space), we would be aligned for a potential future attack, but currently he is blocked by his own body at (3,6) and (2,6). Wait, looking at his body: Head (3,7) -> Body (3,6). He can't move LEFT to (2,7) because his body is at (2,6)? No, (2,6) is a body segment, but (2,7) is currently empty on the board map.\n    *   *Risk:* If I go LEFT, I am moving away from the apple at (3,8) which is directly below me.\n4.  **DOWN:** (3,8) - **SAFE?**\n    *   Is it out of bounds? No.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy is at y=7 and lower. (3,8) is clear.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** There is an apple at (3,8)!\n    *   **Collision Check (CRITICAL):**\n        *   **My move:** (3,9) -> (3,8).\n        *   **Enemy potential moves:** Enemy is at (3,7). He can move UP to (3,8).\n        *   **Result:** If he moves UP and I move DOWN, we both try to enter (3,8) at the same time. **HEAD-ON COLLISION. BOTH DIE.**\n    *   **Score Advantage:** I have 5 apples, he has 5 apples. It is a tie. If we both die, it's a draw. I don't want a draw. I want a win.\n    *   *However*, let's look at the board state. Row 8: `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n        *   (3,8) is an apple.\n        *   (2,8) is empty.\n        *   (4,8) is empty.\n    *   The enemy is currently at (3,7). His body is at (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4).\n    *   Can the enemy actually move UP to (3,8)? Yes, it's empty.\n    *   But wait! I am at (3,9). If I move DOWN to (3,8) and he moves UP to (3,8), we trade 1-for-1.\n    *   **Is there a way to force a kill without dying?**\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), and he moves anywhere else (e.g., UP to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,7) or RIGHT to (4,7)), I survive.\n    *   If he moves UP, we tie.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,9), I miss the apple at (3,8). He might eat it next turn if he moves UP to (3,7) -> (3,8).\n    *   **Aggression Check:** The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" My score is 5, his is 5. I do NOT have a higher score. Therefore, I should NOT force a head-on collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** I need to secure the apple at (3,8) *without* dying.\n    *   Is there a move that guarantees I get the apple?\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,9), I am safe. Next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,8) or (3,8) depending on where he is. But if I go LEFT, I lose control of the (3,8) apple immediately.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I risk the head-on collision.\n    *   **Let's re-evaluate the board.**\n    *   My body fills (4,9) to (8,9).\n    *   Enemy body fills (3,6) to (1,4).\n    *   Enemy Head (3,7).\n    *   Enemy moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6 - Body), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8):\n        *   Enemy moves UP to (3,8) -> **DRAW**. (Bad, I want to win).\n        *   Enemy moves LEFT to (2,7) -> **I SURVIVE**, I eat the apple. I grow. He doesn't.\n        *   Enemy moves RIGHT to (4,7) -> **I SURVIVE**, I eat the apple.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,9):\n        *   I survive. I miss the apple.\n        *   Next turn, enemy might eat the apple at (3,8).\n    *   **Crucial Insight:** The enemy is on the left side. He is trapped by his own body somewhat. He is at (3,7). If he moves UP to (3,8), he exposes his head to me next turn (if I survive). But if I die, I lose.\n    *   **Alternative Move: DOWN.**\n    *   The prompt asks to \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score\". Since scores are tied, I should avoid the head-on collision if possible.\n    *   However, if I move DOWN, and he *doesn't* move UP, I get a massive advantage (apple + growth).\n    *   Is he likely to move UP? He is hunting apples too. The apple is right there.\n    *   BUT, look at his position. He is at (3,7). His body is at (3,6). If he moves UP, he is moving into a \"choke point\" against me? No, (3,8) is open.\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the board map again.**\n    *   `9 . . . 1 T T T T .`\n    *   `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n    *   `7 . . . 0 . . A . . .`\n    *   `6 . T T T . . . . . A`\n    *   Enemy is at (3,7).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am eating the apple.\n    *   If he goes UP to (3,8), we crash.\n    *   If he goes LEFT to (2,7), I eat the apple and survive.\n    *   If he goes RIGHT to (4,7), I eat the apple and survive.\n    *   If he goes DOWN to (3,6) (into his own body), he dies. I survive and eat the apple.\n    *   **Probability:** He wants the apple. He will likely go UP.\n    *   **Can I avoid the collision while getting the apple?**\n    *   No. The apple is at (3,8). To get it, I must go to (3,8). He is at (3,7). To get it, he must go to (3,8). It's a direct conflict.\n    *   **Is there another apple?**\n    *   (0,8) is an apple. It's far.\n    *   (3,8) is the closest.\n    *   **Re-reading the prompt:** \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I am tied. I should NOT force it.\n    *   **Is there a move that denies him the apple without me dying?**\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), I take the apple.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,9), I leave the apple.\n    *   If I leave the apple, he might take it.\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the \"T\" on row 9.**\n    *   `9 . . . 1 T T T T .`\n    *   (5,9) is T. (6,9) is T. (7,9) is T. (8,9) is T.\n    *   My body is at (4,9) to (8,9).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,9), I am safe.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), I risk a draw.\n    *   **BUT, what if I can trap him?**\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,9), I am at (2,9).\n    *   Next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,8). This puts me directly above him if he moved UP to (3,8) or stays at (3,7)? No.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,9), and he goes UP to (3,8).\n    *   Next turn: I am at (2,9). He is at (3,8).\n    *   I can go DOWN to (2,8).\n    *   He can go UP to (3,9). (3,9) is currently empty (I moved away).\n    *   He can go LEFT to (2,8). (I would be there).\n    *   He can go DOWN to (3,7).\n    *   **Actually, let's consider the risk of the draw.**\n    *   If I go DOWN and he goes UP, it's a draw.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I miss the apple.\n    *   **Is there a move that guarantees a win?**\n    *   No. It's turn-based prediction.\n    *   **Let's look at the \"Safe\" moves.**\n    *   LEFT is safe. DOWN is safe *unless* he moves UP.\n    *   **Is he forced to move UP?**\n    *   No. He can move LEFT or RIGHT.\n    *   **Who has the advantage?**\n    *   I am at the top. He is in the middle.\n    *   If I take the apple at (3,8), I grow to length 7. He stays at length 6.\n    *   If I grow, I become more dangerous.\n    *   **Wait, if I go DOWN and he goes UP, we both die. Score 5-5. Draw.**\n    *   **If I go LEFT, I survive. He might eat the apple. Score 5-6. He leads.**\n    *   **If I go LEFT, and he does NOT eat the apple (maybe he goes LEFT to 2,7), then I can eat it next turn.**\n    *   **Is there a way to eat the apple safely?**\n    *   Only if he doesn't move UP.\n    *   **Let's look at the board state.**\n    *   The enemy is at (3,7).\n    *   His body is at (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4).\n    *   He is effectively \"stuck\" on the left side of the board (x <= 3).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), I am blocking his path UP.\n    *   Actually, if I move DOWN to (3,8), and he moves UP to (3,8), we collide.\n    *   **Let's look at the apples.**\n    *   (3,8) is an apple.\n    *   (0,8) is an apple.\n    *   (4,2) is an apple.\n    *   (2,4) is an apple.\n    *   I am at x=3. He is at x=3.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,9), I am moving away from the (3,8) apple.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), I am grabbing the apple.\n    *   **Is there any other apple near me?**\n    *   No. (0,8) is far.\n    *   **What is the enemy likely to do?**\n    *   He sees the apple at (3,8). He is at (3,7). It's a direct path.\n    *   **Is there a way to \"bait\" him?**\n    *   No, he moves simultaneously.\n    *   **Let's reconsider the collision.**\n    *   If I go DOWN and he goes UP -> Draw.\n    *   I want to WIN.\n    *   **Is there a move that offers a better future position?**\n    *   LEFT to (2,9).\n        *   Pros: Safe. Keeps me at top. Denies him the top row if he tries to go up later?\n        *   Cons: Loses the immediate apple.\n    *   DOWN to (3,8).\n        *   Pros: Grabs apple. Grows. Dominates the center.\n        *   Cons: Risk of draw (if he goes UP).\n    *   **Wait, if I go DOWN and he goes UP, it's a draw.**\n    *   **If I go DOWN and he goes LEFT or RIGHT, I win the apple and gain ground.**\n    *   **If I go LEFT and he goes UP, he gets the apple.

T .`\n    *   (8,8) is T. That's my body.\n    *   **If I go DOWN, I am at (3,8).**\n    *   If I am at (3,8), and he is at (3,7) (if he goes DOWN? No, he is at 7, down is 6 (body)). He goes UP to 8? Collision.\n    *   **Let's look at the board from a \"Boxing In\" perspective.**\n    *   I am at (3,9). My body stretches to (8,9) and (8,8).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,9), I am leaving a gap at (3,9).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am filling the gap below me.\n    *   **The prompt says:** \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   My score is NOT higher. It is tied.\n    *   Therefore, I should NOT force a head-on collision.\n    *   **Moving DOWN forces a potential head-on collision.**\n    *   Moving LEFT avoids it.\n    *   **But I want the apple!**\n    *   **Is there a guarantee he won't move UP?**\n    *   No.\n    *   **What if I move DOWN and he moves LEFT?**\n    *   I get the apple. He moves to (2,7).\n    *   Next turn: I am at (3,8) (length 7). He is at (2,7).\n    *   I can move LEFT to (2,8) or DOWN to (3,7).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,8), I am at (2,8).\n    *   He is at (2,7).\n    *   He can move UP to (2,8) -> Collision. (My length 7 vs His length 6). I win if we collide? No, head-on collision kills both.\n    *   **Wait, if I grow to length 7, and we collide next turn, we both die. Score 6-5 (or 6-6 if he ate).**\n    *   **Let's look at the \"Safe\" moves again.**\n    *   LEFT (2,9): Safe. Apple available next turn? (3,8) might be gone. (0,8) is far.\n    *   DOWN (3,8): Risky. High reward.\n    *   **Is there a third option?**\n    *   UP and RIGHT are death.\n    *   **Let's look at the board layout.**\n    *   The enemy is at (3,7). He is \"boxed in\" on the left.\n    *   If I stay on the top row, I can control the flow.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am engaging.\n    *   **Decision:** I want to win. A draw is not a win.\n    *   If I go DOWN, there is a chance he moves LEFT/RIGHT, and I get the apple and grow.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I definitely don't get the apple this turn.\n    *   **Is the apple at (3,8) critical?**\n    *   Yes, it's the only apple near me.\n    *   **Let's calculate the \"Risk vs Reward\".**\n    *   **Move DOWN:**\n        *   25% chance he goes UP (Draw).\n        *   75% chance he goes LEFT/RIGHT (I get apple, I grow).\n        *   (Assuming DOWN is impossible for him due to body).\n    *   **Move LEFT:**\n        *   100% safe.\n        *   0% chance of apple this turn.\n    *   **The prompt says:** \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   Since scores are tied, I should NOT force the collision. But I shouldn't shy away from a *potential* collision if the reward is high.\n    *   However, if I go DOWN and he goes UP, it's a draw. I don't want a draw.\n    *   **Can I move somewhere that secures the apple *without* risking a draw?**\n    *   No. The apple is at (3,8). He is at (3,7). It's a direct path.\n    *   **Wait! Look at the board state again.**\n    *   Row 8: `8 A . . A . . . .

If I don't eat, the tail follows.**\n        *   **If I move LEFT:**\n        *   Head: (2,9).\n        *   Body: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9)].\n        *   **If I move DOWN:**\n        *   Head: (3,8).\n        *   Body: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9)].\n        *   **Comparing the two:**\n        *   **LEFT:** Head at (2,9). Body at (3,9)... This creates a solid wall on row 9. The enemy is at (3,7). He is blocked from going UP past y=7 unless he goes around the side (x=0,1,2). But I am at x=2. I am blocking the top row.\n        *   **DOWN:** Head at (3,8). Body at (3,9)... This creates a vertical block at x=3. The enemy is at (3,7). He is blocked directly below me. He must go LEFT or RIGHT.\n        *   **Which position is better?**\n        *   **LEFT** allows me to stay on the \"high ground\" (y=9). High ground is usually safer and offers more mobility.\n        *   **DOWN** puts me in the mix.\n        *   **Also, look at the board.**\n        *   `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am eating an apple.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (2,9), I am not.\n        *   **Is the risk of a draw worth the apple?**\n        *   If I go DOWN and he goes UP, the game ends in a draw (likely).\n        *   I want to WIN.\n        *   **Therefore, I should play for the win, not for a draw.**\n        *   Playing for a win means avoiding the draw condition.\n        *   **So, I should NOT move DOWN.**\n        *   **I should move LEFT.**\n        *   **What about the apple?**\n        *   I will get it later. Or I will get another one.\n        *   **Let's look at the enemy's perspective.**\n        *   He is at (3,7). He sees the apple at (3,8).\n        *   He will likely move UP.\n        *   If I move DOWN, I meet him there. Draw.\n        *   If I move LEFT, I let him have it.\n        *   **Is there a third option?**\n        *   No.\n        *   **So, the choice is:**\n        *   Move DOWN -> High risk of Draw (Bad for win).\n        *   Move LEFT -> Low risk, Miss apple (Better for win probability).\n        *   **Wait, if I move LEFT, and he moves UP (3,8), he eats the apple.**\n        *   **If I move LEFT, and he moves LEFT (2,7), he doesn't eat the apple.**\n        *   **If I move LEFT, and he moves RIGHT (4,7), he doesn't eat the apple.**\n        *   **He has 3 options.**\n        *   UP (1 option): Eats apple.\n        *   LEFT/RIGHT (2 options): Doesn't eat apple.\n        *   **If he doesn't eat the apple, it stays on the board.**\n        *   **If I am at (2,9) and the apple is at (3,8):**\n        *   Next turn I can go DOWN to (2,8) or (3,8).\n        *   If I go to (3,8), I eat the apple.\n        *   He is at (2,7) or (4,7).\n        *   **Let's assume he goes UP (3,8).**\n        *   He eats apple. Score 6-5.\n        *   He is at (3,8).\n        *   I am at (2,9).\n        *   Next turn: I can go DOWN to (2,8).\n        *   He can go UP to (3,9).\n        *   He can go LEFT to (2,8).\n        *   He can go DOWN to (3,7).\n        *   If he goes UP to (3,9), he is safe.\n        *   If he goes LEFT to (2,8), he hits me if I am there? No, we move simultaneously.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (2,8) and he goes LEFT to (2,8), we collide. Draw (5-6? No, 5-6 is his lead. If we draw, scores are preserved? No, if we both die, game ends. Score 5-6. He wins).\n        *   **So, if he gets the apple (6-5), and then we collide (Draw), he wins.**\n        *   **This makes \"Letting him have the apple\" dangerous.**\n        *   **So, maybe I should fight for the apple?**\n        *   **But if I fight for the apple (Move DOWN) and he fights for it (Move UP), we draw (5-5).**\n        *   **5-5 Draw is better than 5-6 Loss.**\n        *   **Wait, if we collide at 5-6, and both die, the higher score wins. He wins.**\n        *   **If we collide at 5-5, and both die, it's a draw.**\n        *   **So, 5-5 Draw > 5-6 Loss.**\n        *   **Therefore, I should prefer the 5-5 Draw over the 5-6 Loss scenario.**\n        *   **How do I ensure 5-5 Draw?**\n        *   Move DOWN.\n        *   If he moves UP -> Draw (5-5).\n        *   If he moves LEFT/RIGHT -> I get apple (6-5).\n        *   **How do I risk 5-6 Loss?**\n        *   Move LEFT.\n        *   If he moves UP -> He gets apple (5-6).\n        *   Next turn... potential collision where he wins.\n        *   **So, Move DOWN is statistically better?**\n        *   Move DOWN:\n        *   - 25% chance Draw (Acceptable).\n        *   - 75% chance Win (6-5).\n        *   Move LEFT:\n        *   - 25% chance Loss risk (5-6).\n        *   - 75% chance Neutral (5-5).\n        *   **Wait, Move DOWN has a risk of Draw.**\n        *   **Move LEFT has a risk of falling behind.**\n        *   **The prompt says:** \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n        *   I have EQUAL score.\n        *   So I should NOT force it.\n        *   **Does Move DOWN \"force\" it?**\n        *   Yes, I am moving into his path.\n        *   **Does Move LEFT \"force\" it?**\n        *   No, I am moving away.\n        *   **Okay, so strictly following the \"Don't force if equal score\" rule -> Move LEFT.**\n        *   **But the logic of \"Draw is better than Falling Behind\" suggests Move DOWN.**\n        *   **Let's look at the \"Boxing Him In\" objective.**\n        *   If I move LEFT, I am at (2,9).\n        *   My body is at (3,9) to (7,9).\n        *   I am boxing him in from the top-left.\n        *   If I move DOWN, I am at (3,8).\n        *   I am boxing him in from the top-center.\n        *   **Which is better for boxing him in?**\n        *   Moving LEFT puts my body at x=3,4,5,6,7. He is at x=3.\n        *   If I move LEFT, I vacate (3,9). He could potentially go UP to (3,8) then UP to (3,9) if I don't block it.\n        *   If I move DOWN, I keep my body at (3,9). I block (3,9) from below.\n        *   **If I move DOWN, I am at (3,8). My body is at (3,9)... (8,9).**\n        *   This creates a wall at x=3 from y=8 to y=9.\n        *   He is at (3,7). He is blocked.\n        *   **If I move LEFT, I am at (2,9). My body is at (3,9)...**\n        *   This creates a wall at x=3... on row 9. He is at y=7. He can go UP to (3,8). He is not blocked.\n        *   **So, Moving DOWN is better for \"Boxing Him In\" because it blocks his vertical path directly.**\n        *   **Moving LEFT leaves a gap at (3,8) which he can fill.**\n        *   **So, to dominate the board and box him in, I should take the center line.**\n        *   **Move: DOWN.**\n        *   **Risk:** Head-on collision (Draw).\n        *   **Reward:** Apple (Grow) and Board Control.\n        *   **The prompt says:** \"Be aggressive\".\n        *   \"Try to force... if higher score\".\n        *   I am tied.\n        *   **BUT, \"Boxing Him In\" implies taking space.**\n        *   Taking (3,8) is taking space.\n        *   **Let's reconsider the \"No Web Searches\" and \"Pure Skill\".**\n        *   In Snake, controlling the center is usually good.\n        *   **Is there a way to block him without risking a draw?**\n        *   No.\n        *   **So I have to choose: Risk Draw for Apple/Control vs. Play Safe and Miss Apple.**\n        *   **Given the \"Aggressive\" nature of the stream (\"YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT\", \"WE GOTTA BOX HIM IN\"), the audience wants action.**\n        *   **The prompt says:** \"Do not focus on where the apples are.

I don't lose.\n        *   If I don't force it (Let him take apple), I lose the lead.\n        *   **So, forcing the collision (or threatening it) is the defensive move here.**\n        *   **Move: DOWN.**\n        *   **Plan:** Move DOWN to (3,8). If he moves UP -> Draw (Acceptable outcome vs losing lead). If he moves LEFT/RIGHT -> I eat apple, I grow, I lead 6-5.\n        *   **Wait, is there a chance he moves DOWN?**\n        *   No, his body is at (3,6).\n        *   **Is there a chance he moves LEFT?**\n        *   Yes, to (2,7).\n        *   **Is there a chance he moves RIGHT?**\n        *   Yes, to (4,7).\n        *   **Okay.**\n        *   **Move DOWN.**\n        *   **Wait, look at the board state.**\n        *   `9 . . . 1 T T T T .`\n        *   `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n        *   `7 . . . 0 . . A . . .`\n        *   The apple at (3,8) is an 'A'.\n        *   **Wait, looking at the ASCII art again.**\n        *   Row 8: `8 A . . A . . . . T .`\n        *   (3,8) is the 4th character (index 3).

Low reward.\n        *   **Given the context of the game (Tied score, aggressive play, need to grow), taking the center and the apple is the right move, even with the collision risk.**\n        *   **Actually, wait. The prompt says \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score\".**\n        *   **I do NOT have a higher score.**\n        *   **So I should NOT force it.**\n        *   **Does Move DOWN \"force\" it?**\n        *   Yes, by moving into the path.\n        *   **Does Move LEFT \"force\" it?**\n        *   No.\n        *   **So, following the rule strictly: Move LEFT.**\n        *   **BUT, if I move LEFT, I let him eat the apple.**\n        *   **If I let him eat the apple, the score becomes 5-6.**\n        *   **If the score is 5-6, *then* I will have a lower score.**\n        *   **Wait, if I let him get the apple, I am putting myself at a disadvantage.**\n        *   **Is it better to risk a Draw (5-5) now, or accept a Deficit (5-6) now?**\n        *   Risking a Draw preserves the chance to win.\n        *   Accepting a Deficit reduces the chance to win.\n        *   **So, I should take the risk of the Draw.**\n        *   **Therefore, Move DOWN.**\n        *   **Strategy:** \"Dominate the board\".\n        *   Moving DOWN dominates the center.

Even though it risks a draw, a draw is preferable to falling behind.\n        *   **Wait, what if he doesn't move UP?**\n        *   Then I get the apple and the lead. Perfect.\n        *   **What if he moves UP?**\n        *   We draw. Not a win, but not a loss.\n        *   **Okay.**\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (3,8) to secure the apple and block the enemy's vertical advance. If the enemy moves UP, we force a head-on collision (Draw), which is acceptable as it prevents him from taking the lead. If he moves LEFT or RIGHT, I secure the apple and extend my lead to 6-5. I will maintain dominance over the center column.\n\nDOWN",
