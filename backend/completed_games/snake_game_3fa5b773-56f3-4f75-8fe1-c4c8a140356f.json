After that move the next square to the right (7,3) also contains an apple, giving a potential consecutive apple run.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at (0,5) and cannot reach any of my target squares this turn, so there is no risk of a head\u2011on collision.

This opens a clear upward corridor and keeps multiple safe follow\u2011up directions (up, left, right).  \n- Moving LEFT would place me at (2,\u202f7), which is more constrained on the left side of the board and would make the rightward direction permanently unsafe (it would be a backward move into my own body).  \n- The enemy snake #1 is far to the right at (7,\u202f0) and, given its current configuration, its only safe move this turn is to (8,\u202f0). It cannot reach (3,\u202f8) or (2,\u202f7) this turn, so neither move creates a head\u2011on collision risk.  \n- Eating the apple at (3,\u202f8) now raises my apple count to 7 and extends my length, giving me more flexibility for the next few turns while keeping the board\u2019s central\u2011top region open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. Move UP to (3,\u202f8) and eat the apple there.  \n2. In the following turn, evaluate moving LEFT to (2,\u202f8) (another apple) or RIGHT to (4,\u202f8) depending on enemy positioning.  \n3. Keep the upward corridor clear; avoid moving DOWN into (3,\u202f7) which would be a self\u2011collision.  \n4.
