Moving left avoids the enemy at (9,8) and the other apples.\n- Moving UP or RIGHT might be riskier or less efficient: Up is away from apples, right would go toward the enemy's proximity and potential collisions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to approach the apple at (7,0) via (7,4). It\u2019s a safe and direct path, and I can then proceed downward.\n- This path keeps us away from walls and enemy snake, and I can plan future moves accordingly.\n\nDecided move: **LEFT**"

The last move was DOWN, so the snake moved from (3,2) to (3,3), or perhaps the current position is at (3,1) as per the map. For consistency, we'll trust the map: snake at (3,1). \n\n- The last move stated was DOWN, which would place the head at (3,2). But since the snake's position is at (3,1), likely the previous move was UP to (3,1), or perhaps the map is updated with the latest position. Assuming the latest position at (3,1), with the head there, and previous move was DOWN, the snake is at (3,1). \n\n- The map shows the snake at (3,1), and the last move was DOWN, so it moved from (3,2) to (3,1), which suggests the snake's head is at (3,1), and its previous position was (3,2). For safety, we'll treat the head as being at (3,1).\n\n- Our current position: (3,1). Moving down to (3,0): is that safe?

          "rationale": "Thinking:\n\u2022 Nearest apple is straight below at (7,0). A clear vertical corridor: (7,2) and (7,1) are empty; (7,0) holds the apple.  \n\u2022 Up is suicide (my own body).  \n\u2022 Left or Right are safe but lead me away from that easy apple.  \n\u2022 Enemy snake is far (3-column), can\u2019t interfere this turn.\n\nPlan:\n1. This turn \u2013 go DOWN to (7,2).  \n2. Next turn \u2013 continue DOWN, then eat the apple at (7,0).  \n3. After grabbing it, turn LEFT or RIGHT along the bottom row to stay mobile.\n\nMove: DOWN"
