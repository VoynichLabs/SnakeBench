The closest apples are:\n   - (8, 5) which is up and to the right\n   - (8, 1) which is down and to the right\n   - The others are significantly further\n\n3. Analysis:\n   - The enemy snake is at (0, 9), far from my position and not a immediate threat\n   - Moving UP would bring me closer to the cluster of apples in the upper part of the board\n   - Moving RIGHT would start me on the path to (8, 5), which seems like a good target\n\nStrategy for next turns:\nI think I'll aim for the apple at (8, 5) as it's one of the closer ones and puts me in a good position to then go for other apples in the upper right area. This means I should generally move right and up.\n\nFor this specific move, I'll move UP to start positioning myself better for the upper apples while maintaining flexibility in my approach.\n\nDirection: UP"
