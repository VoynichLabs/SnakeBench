We're on the opening move, let's get this bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:**\n   - Head at (4, 1)\n   - No body segments (fresh start!)\n   - Enemy Snake #1 is at (5, 1) - right next to us! \ud83d\udc40\n   - Apples are scattered around. The closest one is at (4, 3) - two steps UP from us.\n   - Board is 10x10, we have tons of room.\n\n2. **Evaluating Moves:**\n   - **UP to (4, 2)**: Safe! No walls, no bodies. Gets us closer to the apple at (4, 3). BUT - enemy is at (5, 1). If they go LEFT, they could hit us. If they go UP to (5, 2), we'd be at (4, 2) - safe distance.\n   - **DOWN to (4, 0)**: Safe! Hits the bottom wall but no collision. However, this moves us AWAY from the nearest apple at (4, 3) and into a corner. Bad long-term positioning.\n   - **LEFT to (3, 1)**: Safe! Moves away from enemy at (5, 1). Apple at (3, 5) is far. Getting boxed in left side early.\n   - **RIGHT to (5, 1)**: **DEATH!** That's exactly where the enemy head is. Head-on collision = both die. INSTANT ELIMINATION. \u274c\n\n3. **Aggressive Strategy Consideration:**\n   - We're both 0 apples, so no score advantage to force head-on collision yet.\n   - Enemy is RIGHT THERE at (5, 1). If they're smart, they might go UP or DOWN to avoid us.\n   - If we go UP and they go LEFT, we could block their path or force them to reconsider.\n\n4. **My Pick: UP to (4, 2)**\n   - Why? Because it's the most AGGRESSIVE forward play that stays safe.\n   - Gets us closer to the apple at (4, 3) - potential growth opportunity next turn.\n   - If the enemy goes UP to (5, 2), we're still adjacent but not colliding.\n   - If they go LEFT toward us, they're approaching our future body position.\n   - This sets up board control toward the center-right where more apples are.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Dominate the center-right quadrant. The apple cluster at (6,4), (7,7), (6,0) suggests that's where the action is. Force the enemy into the left side where there are fewer apples. Use our potential growth at (4,3) to start building body segments for boxing them in.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: UP**\n\nUP",

The opponent\u2019s head is locked at (4,1); they can only move to (3,1), (4,0), or (4,2), none of which intersect our new position, so we stay safe.\n\n**Plan:** Eat the (6,1) apple now to take the lead, then aim for (7,1) or (6,0) next turn while keeping an eye on the rival\u2019s head.

We need to close that gap and start boxing them in.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Current State Analysis:**\n   - Head at (4, 2) after moving UP last turn.\n   - No body yet (we're still growing!).\n   - Enemy Snake #1: Head at (6, 1), body at (5, 1). They're still close but slightly further right now.\n   - Apples: Closest one is at (4, 3) just above us. Also (2, 6) and (3, 5) to the left/up.\n\n2. **Evaluating Moves:**\n   - **UP to (4, 3)**: This hits an apple! That would give us our first point and grow our body to 1 segment. Safe? Yes - no walls, no bodies there. Enemy is at (6,1) - far enough that they can't crash into us immediately. This seems like the best aggressive move to get on the scoreboard.\n   - **DOWN to (4, 1)**: Safe move back to our previous position, but we miss the apple. Not ideal.\n   - **LEFT to (3, 2)**: Safe, but moves away from the apple at (4, 3). Also moves us toward the left side where there are fewer apples.\n   - **RIGHT to (5, 2)**: Also safe, but no apple there. We'd be moving parallel to the enemy but not gaining points.\n\n3. **Aggressive Strategy:**\n   - We're behind 0-1 in apples. Getting that apple at (4, 3) is CRUCIAL to level the score.\n   - After eating, we'll have a body segment at (4, 2), which actually helps us control space.\n   - The enemy might be going for the apple at (6, 0) or (7, 7). By taking (4, 3), we're establishing dominance in the center-left area.\n\n4. **Long-term Plan:**\n   After eating the apple at (4, 3), we'll have a body segment. Next turn, we should look toward (2, 6) or (3, 5) while keeping an eye on the enemy's movement. We want to create a wall between us and them to force them into a corner.\n\n**My Pick: UP to (4, 3)** - Getting that first apple is priority #1. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Let's break down the battlefield and make a plan to dominate this 10x10 grid. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 3) after my UP move last turn. My body is at (4, 2). I just ate that apple at (4, 3) last turn, so my tail should have been (4, 2) and I should be growing. Wait, looking at the board state: Board shows '0' at (4, 3) and 'T' at (4, 2). That's my tail. So my head is at (4, 3) and my body is [(4, 2)]. Apples collected: 1. Scoreboard confirms 1 apple.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (6, 2), body at (6, 1). Apples: 1. They moved RIGHT from (5, 1) to (6, 2)? Actually last state had them at (6, 2) with body (6, 1) already? Let's check: In the board state, there's a '1' at (6, 2) and a 'T' at (6, 1) (since body is listed as (6, 1) in opponent info). So their head is at (6, 2). They're positioned to the right of us.\n- **Board Layout:** Apples are scattered. Closest apples to me: (3, 5) is UP and LEFT, (2, 6) is further UP/LEFT, (4, 5) is UP and RIGHT, (5, 7) is far RIGHT/UP, (6, 0) is DOWN/RIGHT, etc. Enemy is at (6, 2) - they might go for (6, 0) or (7, 7) or (5, 7) etc.\n- **My Body:** Only one segment at (4, 2). So if I move DOWN back to (4, 2), I'd hit my own tail. That's moving backwards into my own body - that's a KILL. So DOWN is immediately dangerous because it's into my body. But wait, technically that's moving into the cell where my body is. According to rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" So moving DOWN to (4, 2) is suicide. Cannot do that.\n\n**2) ELIMINATE IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n- **DOWN to (4, 2):** My body is there. That's moving into my own body -> DEAD. Eliminated.\n- **UP to (4, 4):** Check if (4, 4) is occupied. Board shows at (4,4): looking at the board grid: Row 4 (y=4) is: \". . . . . . A . . .\" which means positions 0-3 are '.', 4 is '.', 5 is '.', 6 is 'A', 7-9 are '.'. So (4, 4) is '.' - empty. No wall. No enemy body there. Enemy head at (6,2) not there. So UP is safe.\n- **LEFT to (3, 3):** Check board row 3 (y=3): \". . . . 0 . . . . .\" That means positions: 0='.',1='.',2='.',3='.',4='0' (my head),5='.',6='.',7='.',8='.',9='.'. So (3, 3) is '.' - empty. No wall, no enemy body (enemy body is at (6,1) and (6,2)). Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Check board row 3: (5,3) is '.' (since after 4='0', 5='.'). So empty. No wall. No enemy body there (enemy is at (6,2) and (6,1)). Safe.\n\n**3) AMONG SAFE MOVES (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), EVALUATE STRATEGY:**\n- **UP to (4, 4):** Moves me up. No apple there. But it gets me closer to apples at (4,5), (3,5), (2,6), (5,7), etc. Keeps me in the center. Down move is forbidden (would hit myself). This move opens up future options: from (4,4) I can go UP to (4,5) (which has an apple), LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or DOWN to (4,3) (but that's backtracking? Actually (4,3) is my head's current position, which will become my body after moving, so moving down later might be safe if my body moves away). Need to think about future. This move seems safe and central.\n- **LEFT to (3, 3):** Moves me left. No apple there. Gets me closer to apples at (2,6) and (3,5). From (3,3) I could go UP to (3,4), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3) (backtrack?), DOWN to (3,2). But RIGHT to (4,3) would be moving into where my body just moved from? Actually after moving LEFT, my body will be at (4,3) and tail at (4,2)? Wait, I need to think about how snake movement works. If I move LEFT from (4,3) to (3,3), my body will become: head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2). So (4,3) becomes my body. So moving RIGHT back to (4,3) next turn would be into my own body -> dead. So LEFT might limit my right options later because I can't go back right immediately without dying. But that's true for any move (you can't reverse direction). However, LEFT moves me towards the left wall a bit more. I'm at x=3 now, left wall at x=0. That's okay.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Moves me right towards the enemy at (6,2). No apple there. Gets me closer to apples at (6,0), (7,7), (5,7), (8,6), etc. But also closer to enemy. Enemy at (6,2) is just one step away from my head at (5,3) if I go RIGHT? Actually distance: (5,3) to (6,2) is not adjacent (dx=1, dy=1). But if enemy moves LEFT and I move RIGHT simultaneously, we could collide? Let's simulate: If I move RIGHT to (5,3), and enemy moves LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2), then our heads are at (5,3) and (5,2) - different cells, no collision. If enemy moves UP to (6,3), then heads at (5,3) and (6,3) - adjacent, not same cell. If enemy moves DOWN to (6,1), heads at (5,3) and (6,1). So immediate collision is unlikely but possible if both move to same cell. However, moving towards enemy is risky because we could trap each other. But we want to be aggressive! Maybe we want to close distance to potentially force a head-on collision later when we have higher score? Currently tied 1-1. So no advantage. Better to grow first.\n\n**4) LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n- Goal: Box in the enemy and force them to crash. But first, we need to grow. We have 1 apple, they have 1. We need to get more apples to have advantage for head-on collisions.\n- We should target nearby apples while keeping an eye on enemy's likely path. Apples near me: (3,5) is 2 steps away (LEFT then UP). (4,5) is 2 steps away (UP then UP). (2,6) is further. (5,7) is far. (6,0) is far and down-right.\n- The enemy is at (6,2). They might go for (6,0) (down) or (7,7) (up-right) or (5,7) (left-up). They might also go for (4,5) or (3,5) if they move left. We need to anticipate.\n- If I go UP now to (4,4), I'm positioned to grab (4,5) next if I go UP again, or go LEFT towards (3,5). This seems flexible.\n- If I go LEFT to (3,3), I can go UP to (3,4) then UP to (3,5) for the apple. That's two moves to the apple.\n- If I go RIGHT to (5,3), I'm moving away from the apple at (3,5) and closer to enemy. Not ideal for grabbing apples quickly.\n\n**5) CONSIDERING ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES:**\n- The enemy might move DOWN to (6,1) (but that's into their own body? Wait, their body is at (6,1) currently? Actually opponent info says Body: [(6,1)]. So head at (6,2), body at (6,1). If they move DOWN to (6,1), that's into their own body -> they die. So DOWN is likely not an option for them unless they want to die. But maybe they would? Unlikely. They probably won't move DOWN.\n- Enemy could move UP to (6,3). That's safe (check board: row 3 at x=6 is '.'). \n- Enemy could move LEFT to (5,2). That's safe (board row 2 at x=5 is 'T'? Actually row 2 (y=2) shows: \". . . . T . 1 . . .\". So (5,2) is 'T'? Wait, T is my tail? My tail is at (4,2) per board. Actually board shows: row 2 (y=2): columns: 0='.',1='.',2='.',3='.',4='T',5='.',6='1',7='.',8='.',9='.'. So (5,2) is '.' - empty. (4,2) is 'T' (my tail). So (5,2) is empty. So enemy can move LEFT to (5,2).\n- Enemy could move RIGHT to (7,2). Safe (board row 2 at x=7 is '.').\n- So enemy likely won't move DOWN. They'll probably go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. If they go LEFT to (5,2), that's towards me but not immediate collision.\n\n**6) HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (5,3) and enemy moves LEFT to (5,2) simultaneously, heads at (5,3) and (5,2) - different cells. Safe.\n- If I move UP to (4,4) and enemy moves LEFT to (5,2), no collision.\n- If I move LEFT to (3,3) and enemy moves UP to (6,3), no collision.\n- It seems collision is not immediate threat this turn.\n\n**7) CHOOSING THE BEST SAFE MOVE:**\n- We want to grow and dominate. The closest apple to my current head (4,3) is (4,5) (two UP moves) or (3,5) (LEFT then UP). There's also an apple at (6,0) but that's far and might be contested by enemy.\n- Moving UP to (4,4) puts me one step closer to (4,5) and also keeps me centered for flexibility. From (4,4), I can go UP to (4,5) to eat apple, or LEFT to (3,4) towards (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,4) towards other apples. It keeps options open.\n- Moving LEFT to (3,3) also keeps options open but moves me left earlier. From there, I can go UP to (3,4) then to (3,5). That's fine too.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,3) moves me towards enemy and away from the left-side apples. Not ideal for grabbing apples quickly. Also, moving right might close the distance and could lead to potential traps if enemy blocks paths.\n\n**8) FAN ENGAGEMENT AND AGGRESSION:**\n- Chat, we need to be smart! We just got our first apple, let's keep the momentum. We need to outgrow the enemy so we can crush them in a collision later.\n- I think UP to (4,4) is the move. It's safe, it's not directly towards the enemy, and it sets us up for the apple at (4,5) or (3,5). We maintain center control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Plan: Grab the apple at (4,5) next turn if possible, then shift towards (3,5) or (2,6) while watching enemy movement. Force them into the right side or bottom-right corner. Keep score advantage!\"\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP is the best move. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Turn 3, scoreboard tied 1-1, let's analyze the battlefield! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 4). Body: [(4, 3)]. Apples: 1. So my tail is at (4, 3) after last move? Wait, last move I went UP from (4, 3) to (4, 4). That means my body should now be [(4, 3)] and tail at (4, 3)? Actually, when I moved UP, my previous head (4,3) became body, and my previous body (4,2) became tail? But the current board shows: Row 4 (y=4): \". . . . . . A . . .\" \u2013 so (4,4) is empty ('.')? Wait, the board representation might not show my head? Let's check the board state provided: It shows '0' at (4,3) and 'T' at (4,2). That seems off because my head should be at (4,4) after my UP move. There might be a discrepancy between the board display and the snake info. Looking closely: The board says \"4 . . . . 0 . A . . .\" \u2013 this is row y=4, x=0 to 9. The '0' is at position x=4? Actually, the row is labeled \"4\" (y=4), and the characters are: column 0='.',1='.',2='.',3='.',4='0',5='.',6='A',7='.',8='.',9='.'. So (4,4) is '0' \u2013 my head is indeed at (4,4). Good. My body: The snake info says body is [(4,3)]. So my body segment is at (4,3). My tail is at (4,3) since only one body segment. So I occupy (4,4) and (4,3).\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (6,3). Body: [(6,2)]. Apples: 1. So enemy head is at (6,3), body at (6,2). They moved UP from (6,2) to (6,3) last turn? That's plausible.\n- **Board:** Apples: (6,4), (3,5), (6,0), (7,7), (0,1), (2,6), (8,6), (4,5), (9,0), (5,7), (8,1), (1,1), (0,9), (5,6), (8,0). Note: (4,5) is an apple directly above my head at (4,4)? Actually (4,5) is one UP from (4,4). That's a juicy apple! Also (3,5) is LEFT and UP, (6,4) is RIGHT and UP, etc.\n- **My Body:** Occupies (4,3). So if I move DOWN to (4,3), that's into my own body -> death. Cannot go DOWN.\n\n**2) ELIMINATE IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n- **DOWN to (4,3):** My body is there. DEAD. Eliminated.\n- **UP to (4,5):** Check occupancy: (4,5) is an apple ('A') according to board? Row 5 (y=5): \". . . A A . . . . .\" \u2013 so (4,5) is 'A' (apple). No snake body there. Enemy head at (6,3) not there. So UP is safe (to an apple!).\n- **LEFT to (3,4):** Check board row 4: (3,4) is '.' (since row 4 shows: col3='.', col4='0'). So empty. No enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (5,4):** Check board row 4: (5,4) is '.' (row 4: col5='.'). Empty. Safe.\n\n**3) AMONG SAFE MOVES, EVALUATE STRATEGY:**\n- **UP to (4,5):** DIRECT APPLE! I eat the apple and grow. This gives me a score lead (2-1). That's huge for future head-on collisions. From (4,5), I'll have more body segments, and I'll be positioned to move towards other apples like (3,5) or (5,6) or (4,6) etc. However, moving UP means my body will now occupy (4,4) and (4,3). But note: moving UP to (4,5) is safe as long as no enemy head moves there simultaneously. Could enemy head move to (4,5)? Enemy is at (6,3). To reach (4,5) in one move, they'd need to go LEFT twice? Actually distance: (6,3) to (4,5) is dx=2, dy=2. Not possible in one move. So (4,5) is not reachable by enemy this turn. So UP is safe and gives me an apple.\n- **LEFT to (3,4):** Moves me towards apples at (3,5) and (2,6). No apple immediately. From (3,4), I can go UP to (3,5) next turn to eat apple. But that's one turn slower than going UP now.\n- **RIGHT to (5,4):** Moves me towards apples at (6,4) and (5,6) and (5,7). But also closer to enemy at (6,3). Might be risky. Also, (6,4) is an apple, but enemy is at (6,3) directly below it. If I go RIGHT now to (5,4), then next turn I could go RIGHT to (6,4) to eat apple, but enemy might go UP to (6,4) simultaneously? Enemy at (6,3) could go UP to (6,4) this turn? That would put enemy head at (6,4) this turn, which is an apple. But if enemy goes UP to (6,4) this turn, and I go RIGHT to (5,4), no collision. But if enemy stays at (6,3) and I go RIGHT to (5,4), then next turn if I go RIGHT to (6,4) and enemy goes UP to (6,4), we collide next turn. So RIGHT move might set up a future collision. Not ideal right now since scores are tied.\n\n**4) CONSIDERING ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES:**\n- Enemy at (6,3) with body at (6,2). They likely won't go DOWN to (6,2) (into their own body). They could go UP to (6,4) (apple there!), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3), or DOWN? No, DOWN is death. So they might go UP to eat the apple at (6,4). That would give them a lead. Or they might go LEFT towards me or other apples.\n- If enemy goes UP to (6,4), that's an apple. They'd grow and lead 2-1. I want to prevent that or outgrow them.\n- If I go UP to (4,5) and eat my apple, I also lead 2-1. That's good.\n\n**5) HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If I go UP to (4,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,3), no collision (different cells).\n- If I go UP to (4,5) and enemy goes UP to (6,4), no collision.\n- If I go UP to (4,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,3), no collision.\n- The only way we collide this turn is if enemy goes LEFT to (5,3) and I go RIGHT to (5,4)? Actually enemy at (6,3) going LEFT to (5,3) and me at (4,4) going RIGHT to (5,4) \u2013 different cells. No collision.\n- If enemy goes LEFT to (5,3) and I go UP to (4,5) \u2013 no.\n- If enemy goes UP to (6,4) and I go RIGHT to (5,4) \u2013 no.\n- So no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**6) LONG-TERM STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\n- We need to get ahead in apples to dominate. Eating the apple at (4,5) now is the fastest way to gain a lead. That's aggressive content!\n- After eating, my body will be longer, giving me more board control. From (4,5), I can move LEFT to (3,5) (another apple!) or RIGHT to (5,5) or UP to (4,6) etc.\n- If I don't eat now, enemy might eat (6,4) and get ahead. Then they could try to force a collision when they have higher score. I don't want that.\n- So UP to (4,5) is the move: safe, apple, lead, sets up future options.\n\n**7) CHAT ENGAGEMENT:**\n- Chat, we see that apple at (4,5) calling our name! Let's grab it and get that 2-1 lead. We're not waiting around! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Plan: After eating apple at (4,5), move LEFT to (3,5) next turn for another apple if safe. Watch enemy movement \u2013 they might go for (6,4) or other apples. Keep the pressure on and force them into corners. Score lead is key for head-on collisions!\"\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP is the clear winner here. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Let's break this down:\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** My snake (ID 0) is at (4,5) with body [(4,4), (4,3)]. Enemy snake #1 is at (6,4) with body [(6,3), (6,2)]. Apples are EVERYWHERE!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (4,6):** Check board: Row 6 shows (4,6) is 'A' (apple from the list: (4,6) is actually listed as (5,6)? Wait, board row 6: \". . A . . A . . A .\" \u2013 positions: x=2='A', x=5='A', x=8='A'. So (4,6) is '.' (empty). No apple there. Safe from own body? My body is at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). Moving UP to (4,6) is forward, not into body. Safe from enemy? Enemy at (6,4) can't reach (4,6) in one move. So UP is safe.\n- **DOWN to (4,4):** That's into my own body (since (4,4) is my body segment). DEAD.

So LEFT is safe and gives me an apple!\n- **RIGHT to (5,5):** Check board: Row 5 shows (5,5) is '.' (empty). Safe from own body? Yes. Safe from enemy? Possibly. But no immediate apple.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:** \nLEFT to (3,5) gives me an APPLE immediately! That would put me at 3 apples vs enemy's 2. That's a HUGE lead! I'd be dominating the board. After eating, my body grows, and I'm positioned to go UP to (3,6) next turn (another apple there? (3,6) is empty? Actually (2,6) is an apple, so (3,6) is empty). But I can chase other apples later.\n\nUP to (4,6) is safe but no apple. RIGHT to (5,5) is safe but no apple.

Score is 4-2 in our favor, but we need to stay aggressive and box out Snake #1.  \n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (2, 5), body: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)].  \n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (5, 5), body: [(5, 4), (6, 4)].  \n- Apples nearby: We're at (2, 5) \u2014 this was just an apple spot, but we ate it last turn! Now it's empty. Adjacent apples: UP (2, 6) is 'A', LEFT (1, 5) is '.' (empty), DOWN (2, 4) is '.' (empty), RIGHT (3, 5) is part of my body (deadly).  \n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**  \n- **UP to (2, 6):** Check row 6: (2, 6) is 'A' (apple!). Safe from own body? Yes (body is behind us). Safe from enemy? Enemy at (5, 5) could move to (5, 6) or (4, 5) \u2014 but (2, 6) is far left, not directly threatened. This gives us an apple (+1), growing our lead to 5-2!  \n- **DOWN to (2, 4):** Row 4: (2, 4) is '.' (empty). Safe from own body? Yes. Safe from enemy? Possibly, but moving down doesn't progress toward more apples or strategic positioning. We're already near the top-left, so down might trap us later.  \n- **LEFT to (1, 5):** Row 5: (1, 5) is '.' (empty). Safe from own body? Yes. Safe from enemy? Yes, but no apple here. Moves us toward (0, 9) apple but far away \u2014 might not be optimal for immediate growth.  \n- **RIGHT to (3, 5):** This is my own body segment (head moves into body) \u2014 DEADLY! Eliminate immediately.  \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nUP to (2, 6) is the play! We grab another apple, extending our lead to 5-2. This keeps us on the top-left side, where apples are plentiful (like (0, 9), (1, 1), (0, 1)), and we force Snake #1 into the right side. With a 3-apple lead, we can start circling or cutting off their escape routes. If they challenge us, we can bait a head-on collision since we're ahead.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nAfter eating at (2, 6), survey for next apple (maybe (0, 9) or loop back to (1, 1)). Keep the enemy confined to the right half \u2014 use our body as a barrier. If they get desperate, we force a collision and win with our size advantage.  \n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP for the apple and domination! Let's gooo!  \n\nUP",

Let's check our moves.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (2, 7), body: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].  \n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (5, 7), body: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4)].  \n- Apples around us: (6, 0), (7, 7), (0, 1), (8, 6), (9, 0), (8, 1), (1, 1), (0, 9), (8, 0), (8, 5), (7, 0), (9, 4), (2, 3), (7, 9), (2, 9). We're at (2, 7)\u2014near apples like (0, 9) and (2, 9) up top, or (1, 1) below. But focus on enemy! They're at (5, 7), which is RIGHT of us. If we go RIGHT, we might get closer to a collision. Need to think ahead.\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**  \n1. **UP to (2, 8):** Safe? Yes\u2014empty, not our body (body is at y=6,5,4). Not enemy body (enemy body is at y=6,5,4,4). Enemy head at (5,7) can't hit us this turn unless they go LEFT (to 4,7) and we go RIGHT? But we're not going RIGHT. UP keeps us moving toward top apples (0,9), (2,9), (7,7). Also opens up more space above\u2014we can swing left later to cut enemy off from left side. Multiple options next turn: LEFT, RIGHT, UP (to 2,9). Good.  \n2. **LEFT to (1, 7):** Safe? Yes\u2014empty. But this puts us closer to left wall. From there, UP to (1,8) is fine, but LEFT to (0,7) is edge. Might limit us. Also, enemy could chase us left? They're at (5,7), might not. But we lose access to top-right apples like (7,7). Less aggressive.  \n3. **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe? Yes\u2014empty. BUT: enemy is at (5,7). If they go LEFT to (4,7), no collision. If they go RIGHT to (6,7), fine. However, this moves us toward enemy territory. If they anticipate and go LEFT, we might close in. Risky. And our body is at (2,6),(2,5)... so (3,7) is safe, but next move back to (2,7) would hit our own tail? Wait, no: tail is at (4,4) currently. After moving RIGHT, tail will move too, so (2,7) becomes empty? Actually, snake moves simultaneously: after we move RIGHT to (3,7), our old head (2,7) becomes body, and tail (4,4) moves forward (if no apple eaten). So (2,7) will be occupied by our second segment. So we can't go back LEFT next turn\u2014that would hit our own body. So RIGHT might trap us if we can't go UP or DOWN later.  \n4. **DOWN to (2, 6):** DEADLY\u2014our own body is at (2, 6)! Eliminate.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nUP to (2, 8) is the move! It's safe, keeps us in the center-top, and gives us room to maneuver. The enemy is at (5,7)\u2014if they go UP to (5,8) or LEFT, we can react. We're ahead in apples, so we play smart. Long-term: Use our length to block the top row. If enemy goes UP, we might bait them into a collision next turn if we go RIGHT? But better to dominate space. Plan: From (2,8), next turn go LEFT or UP toward (0,9) or (2,9) apple while keeping exit RIGHT. Force enemy into corners. If they crash into us, we win. Let's go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLong-term plan: Circle top-left, cut off enemy access to left apples. Aim for head-on if they challenge\u2014our size wins.\n\nUP",

The board is tighter now. We need to box them in. They're pinned on the right side? Not yet. Let's plan.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \n- My safe moves from (2,8):  \n  - UP to (2,9): Empty? Yes! Apple (2,9) is there\u2014we'd EAT and grow to 6 apples! That's CONTENT. But wait, is it safe long-term? From (2,9), we'd be at the top edge. Moves: DOWN (back to 2,8, but that's our body after this move? No, after moving UP, our old head (2,8) becomes body, and tail (4,5) moves forward. So (2,8) will be occupied by segment 2. So DOWN would hit our own body\u2014dead. LEFT to (1,9) is possible, RIGHT to (3,9) is empty, but that's it. Trapped on the top row? Risky if enemy blocks.  \n  - LEFT to (1,8): Empty? Yes. From there, we can go UP to (1,9), RIGHT to (2,8) (but that'll be our body after this move), or DOWN to (1,7). Keeps options open.  \n  - RIGHT to (3,8): Empty? Yes.

Not ideal.  \n  - DOWN to (2,7): DEAD\u2014our own body is there (first segment). Eliminate.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nUP to (2,9) is tempting for the apple and growth, but it's a trap! We'd eat and grow, but we'd be stuck on the top row with only two exits (LEFT and RIGHT). Enemy could easily block us from below or force a collision. We're the long snake\u2014we need space to maneuver, not get boxed in. LEFT to (1,8) is safer: it moves us left toward the center-left, away from enemy territory. From (1,8), we can chase apples like (0,9) or (1,1), or even swing down to cut off enemy access to the left side. We're already ahead in apples, so let's deny the enemy space instead. If they go UP to (5,8) or something, we can react aggressively later. Plan: Control the left side, force them into the right corner, and if they chase us, we'll set up a head-on collision\u2014we have +1 apple lead, we win that. Let's go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (1,8), aim for (0,9) apple next turn if safe, then loop down to (0,1) or (1,1) to dominate left side.

Also, from (1,7), we have DOWN to (1,6) (safe? row 6: \". . T . . T . . A .\"\u2014(1,6) empty), LEFT to (0,7) (empty), RIGHT to (2,7) (dead\u2014our body), UP back to (1,8) (body). So three safe moves, but we're moving toward the center-right where enemy is. Not ideal for controlling space.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're the aggressor! LEFT to (0,8) dominates the left side. It sets us up to grab (0,9) apple next turn if enemy doesn't block, or loop down to (0,1) or (1,1) later. Enemy is on the right\u2014we can force them into a corner. Our score is tied, so we need to grow while keeping them contained. UP is a trap (top row prison), DOWN is okay but moves us closer to danger, RIGHT is suicide. LEFT is the power move for board control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (0,8), aim for (0,9) apple next turn to grow to 6 apples, then pivot down to (0,1) or (1,1) to lock down left side and deny enemy apples. Keep head-on collisions in mind\u2014if they chase, we win with our longer reach. Let's box them in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Enemy head at (7,7), body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]? Wait, recheck: enemy body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]\u2014so head at (7,7) is ALSO a body segment? Actually, the list is head-to-tail, so head is (7,7), first body is (7,7)? That can't be\u2014probably a typo in the data. From board state: row 7 has \". . T . . T T 1 .\"\u2014so (7,7) is \"1\" (enemy head), (6,7) is \"T\" (enemy body), (5,7) is \"T\". So body is [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]? But given body is [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)], that means head is (8,7)? No, in the scoreboard it says head (8,7). Let's check the board: row 8: \". 0 T T . . . . . . .\" so (8,7) is \"T\"? Row 7: (8,7) is not listed; row 7 shows up to 9 columns: col 0-9. So (8,7) is column 8 row 7? Row 7: \". . T . . T T 1 .\"\u2014that's 9 entries, missing col 0? Actually it's probably: col0:., col1:., col2:T, col3:., col4:., col5:T, col6:T, col7:1, col8:., col9:. So (8,7) is empty? But scoreboard says head at (8,7). That means enemy head at (8,7), body starts at (7,7) etc. So board state might be slightly off, but we'll trust the given data: enemy head (8,7), body [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)]. Apples are many, but we ignore them for now\u2014focus on CRUSHING THE ENEMY!\n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (0,8):**\n- **UP to (0,9):** Empty? Board row 9: \"A . A . . . . . A .\"\u2014so (0,9) is \"A\" (apple). Safe to move onto apple, we grow to 6 apples. From (0,9), options: DOWN to (0,8) (our body after this move\u2014dead), LEFT off board\u2014dead, RIGHT to (1,9) (empty? row 9 col1 is '.'\u2014yes). So only one safe follow-up: RIGHT to (1,9). Trapped on top row\u2014enemy could block (1,9) or come up. Risky if enemy moves to cut us off. We want space, not a prison!\n- **RIGHT to (1,8):** DEAD\u2014our own body (first segment). Eliminate.\n- **DOWN to (0,7):** Empty? Row 7: \". . T . . T T 1 .\"\u2014col0 is '.'\u2014empty. Safe. From (0,7), we have UP to (0,8) (body after this move\u2014dead), DOWN to (0,6) (row6 col0: '.'\u2014empty), LEFT off board\u2014dead, RIGHT to (1,7) (row7 col1: '.'\u2014empty). So two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Better options! We're still on left edge, controlling space. We can go down towards (0,1) or (1,1) apples later, or swing right to cut enemy's left side. Enemy is on the right (around column 5-8), so we want to expand downward and rightward to block their access to left-side apples.\n- **LEFT to (-1,8):** Off board\u2014DEAD. Eliminate.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nWe're the aggressor! DOWN to (0,7) dominates the left side without trapping ourselves. It sets us up to chase (0,1) or (1,1) apples later, and we keep multiple escape routes. UP is a trap (only one safe move after), RIGHT is suicide. Enemy is on the right\u2014we can force them into a corner by taking the bottom-left. Our score is tied, so we need to grow while denying them space. If they chase us down, we can easily loop back or go for head-on later. Let's box them in from below! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (0,7), next turn go DOWN to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,7) based on enemy move\u2014aim to sweep bottom-left apples like (0,1) or (1,1) while keeping right flank open for cuts. Grow to 6 apples first, then mirror enemy's position to force a collision when we're longer. Stay aggressive, chat!",
