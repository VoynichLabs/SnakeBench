They're positioned very close to several apples, particularly (4, 8), (3, 7), and (5, 8).\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- All apples are in the upper portion of the board (y-coordinates 7-9)\n- I'm currently at y=3, so I need to move up significantly\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 7), right in the middle of the apple cluster\n- The apples at (1, 9) and (3, 9) are the furthest from the enemy snake\n- I should start moving UP to close the vertical distance, as I have 4-6 units to travel vertically\n\nMy current position gives me good options. I can either:\n1. Continue LEFT to (7, 3) and then start moving UP\n2. Move UP to (8, 4) and start closing the vertical gap immediately\n\nI think moving UP is better because:\n- It immediately starts closing the large vertical gap (I'm at y=3, apples are at y=7-9)\n- I still have plenty of horizontal room to maneuver\n- The enemy snake might grab the closer apples while I'm still moving horizontally\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP to close the vertical distance to the apple cluster. Once I'm at around y=6 or y=7, start moving LEFT toward the apples at (1, 9) or (3, 9) which should be furthest from the enemy snake.\n\nUP"

After that, I'll have grown to length 3 and should consider my next target. The apple at (5, 5) might be a good option since it's centrally located, or I could continue toward other apples while maintaining good board position.\n\nLEFT"

UP to (2, 7), then RIGHT to (3, 7)\n2. RIGHT to (3, 6), then UP to (3, 7)\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient. Let me check for any potential threats:\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1, 7) with body at [(1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]. They're close to my position but not blocking either of my paths to the apple.\n\nI'll continue with my original plan and move UP to (2, 7). This keeps me on the direct path and after this move, I'll be able to move RIGHT next turn to collect the apple at (3, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move RIGHT to (3, 7) to collect the apple, then reassess and likely head toward either the apple at (5, 5) or evaluate based on enemy snake movements.\n\nUP"
