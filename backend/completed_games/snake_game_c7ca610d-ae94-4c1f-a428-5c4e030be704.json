No body segments.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Single segment at (0, 4). No body segments.\n- **Apples:** (1, 5), (6, 1), (8, 6), (1, 2), (2, 9).\n\n**Current Positions:**\n- Your head is at (3, 3).\n- Enemy head is at (0, 4).\n\n**Possible Moves for You:**\nSince you're a single-segment snake, you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT without immediately dying (no body to collide with yet). However, you must avoid moving into the enemy's current position (0, 4) unless you're sure the enemy won't move into you.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\n1. **UP (3, 3) \u2192 (3, 4):**\n   - New position: (3, 4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not on the board edge.\n     - Not overlapping with enemy's current position (0, 4).\n     - No self-collision (only one segment).\n   - **Safe.**\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 3) \u2192 (3, 2):**\n   - New position: (3, 2).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not on the board edge.\n     - Not overlapping with enemy's current position (0, 4).\n     - No self-collision.\n   - **Safe.**\n\n3. **LEFT (3, 3) \u2192 (2, 3):**\n   - New position: (2, 3).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not on the board edge.\n     - Not overlapping with enemy's current position (0, 4).\n     - No self-collision.\n   - **Safe.**\n\n4. **RIGHT (3, 3) \u2192 (4, 3):**\n   - New position: (4, 3).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Not on the board edge.\n     - Not overlapping with enemy's current position (0, 4).\n     - No self-collision.\n   - **Safe.**\n\nAll four moves are safe for now. Now, let's evaluate which move is best.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Apple Reachability**\nYour goal is to reach apples while keeping options open. Let's see which move gets you closer to apples:\n\n1. **UP (3, 4):**\n   - Nearest apple: (1, 5) (distance: sqrt((3-1)^2 + (4-5)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.24).\n   - Other apples are farther away.\n\n2. **DOWN (3, 2):**\n   - Nearest apple: (1, 2) (distance: sqrt((3-1)^2 + (2-2)^2) = sqrt(4 + 0) = 2).\n   - This is closer to (1, 2) than UP is to (1, 5).\n\n3. **LEFT (2, 3):**\n   - Nearest apple: (1, 2) (distance: sqrt((2-1)^2 + (3-2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) \u2248 1.41).\n   - This is the closest to (1, 2) among all options.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4, 3):**\n   - Nearest apple: (6, 1) (distance: sqrt((4-6)^2 + (3-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) \u2248 2.83).\n   - Farther from all apples compared to other options.\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT is the best move to reach the closest apple (1, 2) in the fewest steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Movement Considerations**\nThe enemy is at (0, 4). They could move in any direction, but their best options are likely UP, RIGHT, or DOWN to avoid immediate collision with you. However, since you're moving LEFT to (2, 3), the enemy would have to move in a way that doesn't immediately collide with you. For example:\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 4), they won't collide with you at (2, 3).\n- If they move UP to (0, 5), no collision.\n- If they move DOWN to (0, 3), no collision.\n\nNo immediate threat from the enemy in this move.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Strategy Note**\n- **Short-term:** Prioritize reaching the apple at (1, 2) by moving LEFT. This is the closest and safest apple to grab.\n- **Mid-term:** After growing, avoid getting trapped in corners. Keep multiple escape routes open.\n- **Long-term:** Watch for enemy movements and avoid head-on collisions. If the enemy starts growing, they may become a bigger threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **LEFT**, as it gets you closest to an apple while keeping you safe.\n\n**LEFT**",

It could move UP to (1,6) or RIGHT to (2,5). If it moves RIGHT, it may block my path to (1,2) or (2,2) in the future. I need to act fast to claim (1,2) before it becomes contested.\n3. **Expand toward the center (y=4-6)** to create space for future growth and avoid corner traps. The apple at (6,1) is a long-term target, but I need to secure shorter-term gains first.\n\n**Mid-Term Tactics:**\n- After reaching (1,2), **grow toward (0,2) or (2,2)** to secure the bottom-left corner and prevent Snake #1 from encroaching.\n- If Snake #1 moves aggressively toward (1,6) or (2,5), **block its path** by positioning my tail near its potential growth areas (e.g., (1,4) or (2,4)).\n- Watch for **apple clusters** (e.g., (8,6), (8,3)) and plan routes to monopolize them while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\n**Long-Term Vision:**\n- **Control high-value areas** (center and edges) to limit enemy mobility.\n- **Avoid stagnation**: If Snake #1 corners me, force it into a tight space where it risks collision with its own body.\n- **Exploit enemy mistakes**: If Snake #1 moves recklessly (e.g., toward my body), cut off its retreat paths.\n\n---\n### **Analysis of Current State (Turn 3)**\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1,3) (after moving LEFT from (2,3)).\n- Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (no immediate threats).\n- Closest apple: (1,2) (distance 1 via LEFT).\n- Next closest: (0,2) (distance 2 via LEFT then DOWN or UP then LEFT).\n\n**Enemy (Snake #1):**\n- Head: (1,5), Body: [(1,4)].\n- Potential moves: UP (1,6), RIGHT (2,5), LEFT (1,4) [invalid, own body], DOWN (1,4) [invalid].\n- Likely to move UP (1,6) or RIGHT (2,5). If it moves RIGHT, it could eventually threaten (2,2) or (2,3).\n\n**Apples:**\n- (1,2) is the closest (distance 1 via LEFT).\n- (1,5) is occupied by Snake #1\u2019s head, so not reachable.\n- Others are farther.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n- Moving **LEFT to (1,2)** will let me eat the apple immediately, growing my snake to length 1 (head + tail).\n- Moving **UP to (2,3)** or **DOWN to (1,2)** (but (1,2) is the apple, so same as LEFT).\n- Moving **RIGHT to (2,3)** is safe but doesn\u2019t help with apple collection.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\n- Snake #1 is likely to move UP to (1,6) or RIGHT to (2,5).\n  - If it moves UP, it won\u2019t threaten me immediately.\n  - If it moves RIGHT, it could eventually block my path to (2,2) or (1,2) if I don\u2019t act fast.\n\n---\n### **Final Decision**\n**LEFT** (to (1,2)) to eat the apple immediately and grow my snake. This secures the bottom-left corner and prevents Snake #1 from easily encroaching later.\n\n---\nLEFT",
