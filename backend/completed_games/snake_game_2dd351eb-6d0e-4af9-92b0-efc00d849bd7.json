However, if it moves UP again to (2, 7) on the same turn, this would be a head-on collision. Since we don't know the enemy's move, this is risky.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- Closest apple to me: (3, 6) - 2 units away\n- (4, 7) apple is also relatively close - 3 units away\n\n**Strategy Considerations:**\n- I want to move toward the nearest apple at (3, 6)\n- Moving RIGHT puts me at (2, 7), which is closer to both (3, 6) and (4, 7) apples\n- Moving RIGHT could lead to a head-on collision if enemy snake #0 moves UP twice\n- Moving UP or DOWN doesn't significantly improve my position toward apples\n- Moving LEFT takes me away from all apples\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe RIGHT move is the most dangerous due to potential head-on collision, but it's also the most strategically valuable move as it positions me well for apple collection.\n\nHowever, I should prioritize safety first. Moving RIGHT has a significant risk of collision. Moving UP is the safest option and still keeps me in a reasonable position.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (3, 6) first. Move carefully to avoid the enemy snake while positioning myself for apple collection. Try to force the enemy into less optimal paths while maintaining safe distance.\n\nDOWN",
