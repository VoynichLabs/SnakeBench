However, I can\u2019t move diagonally, so I\u2019ll need to plan my moves carefully.  \n\n### Next Move:\nFor this turn, moving **UP** to (6, 6) is safe and keeps me flexible for future moves. It also positions me closer to the apple at (6, 7) in case I decide to go for it later.  \n\n**Next Move: UP**  \n\n**Strategy for Next Turn**: Consider moving toward the apple at (6, 7) or (7, 4) depending on the updated board state."
