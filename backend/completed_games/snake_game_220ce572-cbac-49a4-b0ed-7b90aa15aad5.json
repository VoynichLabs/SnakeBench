Moving right (to (8,5)) would bring us closer to the apple at (8,3), but our last move was LEFT, and the current position is at (7,5). (Note: the previous move is recorded as DOWN\u2014so I need to be cautious about the sequence.)\n\nWait, earlier, you said:\n\n\"Your last move was LEFT, moving from (9,5) to (8,5).\"\n\nBut that conflicts with the position provided: the snake is now at (7,5). So perhaps the move sequence was:\n\n- From (9,5), move LEFT to (8,5),\n- Then from (8,5), move LEFT again to (7,5).\n\nBut you mentioned last move is DOWN, which indicates that after moving left, the next move was down.\n\nGiven the current, it says last move: DOWN, which was to move from (8,5) to (8,4).\n\nSo, for clarity:\n\n- Initial position: (7,5)\n- Last move: DOWN -> from (8,5) to (8,4) (or perhaps from (8,5) to (8,4))\n- Wait, the user said: \"Your last move was LEFT, moving from (9,5) to (8,5).\"\n\nBut then the last move info says: \"Direction: DOWN,\" indicating that the move just taken was down.\n\nLet's organize these details:\n\nTotal info:\n\n- Current position: (7,5) with body at [(7,5)]\n- Last move: DOWN (implying previous position was (7,6))\n- Previous move: LEFT (was from (9,5) to (8,5))\n\nPossibility:\n\n- Started at (9,5), moved LEFT to (8,5),\n- Then moved DOWN to (8,4),\n- Now at (7,5) with body at [(7,5)]?

Moving right (to (8,5)) would bring us closer to the apple at (8,3), but our last move was LEFT, and the current position is at (7,5). (Note: the previous move is recorded as DOWN\u2014so I need to be cautious about the sequence.)\n\nWait, earlier, you said:\n\n\"Your last move was LEFT, moving from (9,5) to (8,5).\"\n\nBut that conflicts with the position provided: the snake is now at (7,5).

(2,1) is empty.\n- Moving LEFT now puts us in a position where next move down gets us the apple.\n- Similarly, moving DOWN first puts us at (3,0), then LEFT to apple.\n\nOption between the two:\n- If we move LEFT first, we are also moving closer to the cluster of apples at the top left (like at (2,6)) for the future.\n- If we move DOWN first, we approach the bottom apple right away.\n\nConclusion:\n- Move LEFT first to (2,1), then DOWN to (2,0) apple.\n- We avoid going near the wall or enemy snake for now.\n- It's safe and simple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Moving right (to (8,5)) would bring us closer to the apple at (8,3), but our last move was LEFT, and the current position is at (7,5). (Note: the previous move is recorded as DOWN\u2014so I need to be cautious about the sequence.)\n\nWait, earlier, you said:\n\n\"Your last move was LEFT, moving from (9,5) to (8,5).\"\n\nBut that conflicts with the position provided: the snake is now at (7,5). So perhaps the move sequence was:\n\n- From (9,5), move LEFT to (8,5),\n- Then from (8,5), move LEFT again to (7,5).\n\nBut you mentioned last move is DOWN, which indicates that after moving left, the next move was down.\n\nGiven the current, it says last move: DOWN, which was to move from (8,5) to (8,4).\n\nSo, for clarity:\n\n- Initial position: (7,5)\n- Last move: DOWN -> from (8,5) to (8,4) (or perhaps from (8,5) to (8,4))\n- Wait, the user said: \"Your last move was LEFT, moving from (9,5) to (8,5).\"\n\nBut then the last move info says: \"Direction: DOWN,\" indicating that the move just taken was down.\n\nLet's organize these details:\n\nTotal info:\n\n- Current position: (7,5) with body at [(7,5)]\n- Last move: DOWN (implying previous position was (7,6))\n- Previous move: LEFT (was from (9,5) to (8,5))\n\nPossibility:\n\n- Started at (9,5), moved LEFT to (8,5),\n- Then moved DOWN to (8,4),\n- Now at (7,5) with body at [(7,5)]?
