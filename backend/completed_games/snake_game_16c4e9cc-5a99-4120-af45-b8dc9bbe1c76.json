            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

My snake (ID 0) is at (7,5) with no body segments yet. There are apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0).

The enemy is at (6,7).\n\nApples: \n- (6,5) is adjacent to my left? From (7,5), (6,5) is one cell left.\n- (6,3) is two cells down from me? From (7,5) to (6,5) left, then (6,4) down, then (6,3) down again? \n- (3,5) is four cells left.\n- (9,9) is four cells right and four up.\n- (6,0) is one left and five down.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is the closest and I can reach it in one move by going LEFT.\n\nBut let me consider the enemy snake at (6,7). They are two cells above the apple at (6,5). They might be aiming for that apple too. If I move LEFT to (6,5), I will eat it. But what can the enemy do?\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake at (6,7):\n- UP: to (6,8) \u2013 away from the apple.\n- DOWN: to (6,6) \u2013 closer to the apple (6,5). Then next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5).\n- LEFT: to (5,7) \u2013 away from (6,5).\n- RIGHT: to (7,7) \u2013 away from the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they will be one cell above the apple. Then if I go LEFT to (6,5), I eat it before they can get there on their next move. Because from (6,6), they would need to go DOWN to (6,5), but by then I have already taken it.\n\nIf I don't move LEFT and go somewhere else, the enemy might get it.\n\nOther options for me:\n- UP: to (7,6) \u2013 no apple there, and it moves away from all apples except maybe (9,9) which is far.\n- DOWN: to (7,4) \u2013 closer to (6,3) apple, but (6,5) is closer and more immediate.\n- RIGHT: to (8,5) \u2013 away from most apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best to secure (6,5).\n\nBut what about safety? My body is empty, so no self-collision. The enemy is at (6,7), which is two cells up. If I move to (6,5), and enemy moves to (6,6), then we are adjacent but not colliding. Collision only happens if we occupy the same cell.\n\nAfter I eat the apple, my snake will grow, so next turn I will have a body segment at (7,5). Then I need to move from (6,5) to somewhere without hitting anything.\n\nPossible moves after eating:\n- From (6,5): UP to (6,6) \u2013 but if enemy is at (6,6), that would kill me if they are there. But I don't know where they will be.\n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 toward (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2013 but that's where my tail will be, so I would run into myself.\n\nAfter eating, moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be suicide because my tail is at (7,5). So I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (6,5), I should go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5), depending on the situation.\n\nBut for now, the priority is to get the apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe user's last move was from (8,5) to (7,5) by moving LEFT, and now I am at (7,5). So continuing LEFT to (6,5) makes sense.\n\nIs (6,5) still an apple? The board shows it as 'A' at row 5, column 6, which is (6,5). Yes.\n\nEnemy snake: they are at (6,7), which is directly above the apple. If they move DOWN to (6,6), then next turn they can move DOWN to (6,5). But if I move LEFT now, I take (6,5) before they can get there, since they need two moves to reach (6,5): DOWN to (6,6) then DOWN to (6,5). I only need one move to (6,5).\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nIf the enemy moves directly to where I am going? But they can't predict perfectly. Statistically, they might not move directly to (6,5) immediately.\n\nOther apples: (6,3) is below, which I could go for if I avoid the enemy, but (6,5) is closer.\n\n(3,5) is three cells left, but I can get (6,5) in one move.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating, go DOWN to (6,4) to avoid my tail and head toward (6,3) apple, unless the enemy is threatening.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple there. This is the closest apple and I can reach it in one move. The enemy at (6,7) is two cells away and cannot reach it before me if they move down. After eating, I'll have a body segment at my previous position (7,5), so I should avoid moving back there next turn. I can consider moving DOWN toward the (6,3) apple or LEFT toward (3,5) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

The enemy is at (6,7).\n\nApples: \n- (6,5) is adjacent to my left? From (7,5), (6,5) is one cell left.\n- (6,3) is two cells down from me? From (7,5) to (6,5) left, then (6,4) down, then (6,3) down again? \n- (3,5) is four cells left.\n- (9,9) is four cells right and four up.\n- (6,0) is one left and five down.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is the closest and I can reach it in one move by going LEFT.\n\nBut let me consider the enemy snake at (6,7). They are two cells above the apple at (6,5). They might be aiming for that apple too. If I move LEFT to (6,5), I will eat it. But what can the enemy do?\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake at (6,7):\n- UP: to (6,8) \u2013 away from the apple.\n- DOWN: to (6,6) \u2013 closer to the apple (6,5). Then next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5).\n- LEFT: to (5,7) \u2013 away from (6,5).\n- RIGHT: to (7,7) \u2013 away from the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they will be one cell above the apple. Then if I go LEFT to (6,5), I eat it before they can get there on their next move. Because from (6,6), they would need to go DOWN to (6,5), but by then I have already taken it.\n\nIf I don't move LEFT and go somewhere else, the enemy might get it.\n\nOther options for me:\n- UP: to (7,6) \u2013 no apple there, and it moves away from all apples except maybe (9,9) which is far.\n- DOWN: to (7,4) \u2013 closer to (6,3) apple, but (6,5) is closer and more immediate.\n- RIGHT: to (8,5) \u2013 away from most apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best to secure (6,5).\n\nBut what about safety? My body is empty, so no self-collision. The enemy is at (6,7), which is two cells up. If I move to (6,5), and enemy moves to (6,6), then we are adjacent but not colliding. Collision only happens if we occupy the same cell.\n\nAfter I eat the apple, my snake will grow, so next turn I will have a body segment at (7,5). Then I need to move from (6,5) to somewhere without hitting anything.\n\nPossible moves after eating:\n- From (6,5): UP to (6,6) \u2013 but if enemy is at (6,6), that would kill me if they are there. But I don't know where they will be.\n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 toward (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2013 but that's where my tail will be, so I would run into myself.\n\nAfter eating, moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be suicide because my tail is at (7,5). So I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (6,5), I should go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5), depending on the situation.\n\nBut for now, the priority is to get the apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe user's last move was from (8,5) to (7,5) by moving LEFT, and now I am at (7,5). So continuing LEFT to (6,5) makes sense.\n\nIs (6,5) still an apple? The board shows it as 'A' at row 5, column 6, which is (6,5). Yes.\n\nEnemy snake: they are at (6,7), which is directly above the apple. If they move DOWN to (6,6), then next turn they can move DOWN to (6,5). But if I move LEFT now, I take (6,5) before they can get there, since they need two moves to reach (6,5): DOWN to (6,6) then DOWN to (6,5). I only need one move to (6,5).\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nIf the enemy moves directly to where I am going? But they can't predict perfectly. Statistically, they might not move directly to (6,5) immediately.\n\nOther apples: (6,3) is below, which I could go for if I avoid the enemy, but (6,5) is closer.\n\n(3,5) is three cells left, but I can get (6,5) in one move.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating, go DOWN to (6,4) to avoid my tail and head toward (6,3) apple, unless the enemy is threatening.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple there. This is the closest apple and I can reach it in one move. The enemy at (6,7) is two cells away and cannot reach it before me if they move down. After eating, I'll have a body segment at my previous position (7,5), so I should avoid moving back there next turn. I can consider moving DOWN toward the (6,3) apple or LEFT toward (3,5) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

Collect apples to grow and score points.\n\nPath options:\n- If I go UP to (6,6): \n  - This moves me away from most apples except (9,9) which is far. \n  - Enemy at (7,7) could move RIGHT to (8,7) or UP to (7,8), not directly threatening me immediately.\n  - But it's inefficient for apple collection.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,4):\n  - One step closer to (6,3) apple. I can eat it next turn by moving DOWN again to (6,3).\n  - Also positions me for (6,0) later.\n  - Safe as no immediate threats.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,5):\n  - Moves toward (3,5) apple, which is three moves away (LEFT to (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5)).\n  - Also safe.\n\nComparing DOWN vs LEFT:\n- (6,3) apple is two moves away if I go DOWN (to (6,4) then to (6,3)).\n- (3,5) apple is three moves away if I go LEFT (to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)).\n- (6,3) is closer in terms of moves required from my current position.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is directly below me, so DOWN is the most direct path to an apple.\n\nRisks:\n- Enemy might be moving toward (6,3) as well. From (7,7), they could go DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6) or (6,5), but since I'm at (6,5), they might avoid collision. If they go DOWN multiple times, they could reach (7,3) or similar, but not directly threatening (6,3) immediately.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), I can consider:\n- Continuing DOWN to (6,2) toward (6,0) apple.\n- Or moving LEFT toward (3,5) if enemy is not there.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems optimal to get to the nearest apple quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (6,4), if the apple is still at (6,3), move DOWN again to eat it. Watch out for enemy movements.\n\nTherefore, my move will be DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,4) to head toward the apple at (6,3). This is the closest apple and positions me for future moves while avoiding my tail. Next turn, I plan to continue DOWN to (6,3) if possible.\n\nDirection: DOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

The enemy is at (6,7).\n\nApples: \n- (6,5) is adjacent to my left? From (7,5), (6,5) is one cell left.\n- (6,3) is two cells down from me? From (7,5) to (6,5) left, then (6,4) down, then (6,3) down again? \n- (3,5) is four cells left.\n- (9,9) is four cells right and four up.\n- (6,0) is one left and five down.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is the closest and I can reach it in one move by going LEFT.\n\nBut let me consider the enemy snake at (6,7). They are two cells above the apple at (6,5). They might be aiming for that apple too. If I move LEFT to (6,5), I will eat it. But what can the enemy do?\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake at (6,7):\n- UP: to (6,8) \u2013 away from the apple.\n- DOWN: to (6,6) \u2013 closer to the apple (6,5). Then next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5).\n- LEFT: to (5,7) \u2013 away from (6,5).\n- RIGHT: to (7,7) \u2013 away from the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they will be one cell above the apple. Then if I go LEFT to (6,5), I eat it before they can get there on their next move. Because from (6,6), they would need to go DOWN to (6,5), but by then I have already taken it.\n\nIf I don't move LEFT and go somewhere else, the enemy might get it.\n\nOther options for me:\n- UP: to (7,6) \u2013 no apple there, and it moves away from all apples except maybe (9,9) which is far.\n- DOWN: to (7,4) \u2013 closer to (6,3) apple, but (6,5) is closer and more immediate.\n- RIGHT: to (8,5) \u2013 away from most apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best to secure (6,5).\n\nBut what about safety? My body is empty, so no self-collision. The enemy is at (6,7), which is two cells up. If I move to (6,5), and enemy moves to (6,6), then we are adjacent but not colliding. Collision only happens if we occupy the same cell.\n\nAfter I eat the apple, my snake will grow, so next turn I will have a body segment at (7,5). Then I need to move from (6,5) to somewhere without hitting anything.\n\nPossible moves after eating:\n- From (6,5): UP to (6,6) \u2013 but if enemy is at (6,6), that would kill me if they are there. But I don't know where they will be.\n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 toward (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2013 but that's where my tail will be, so I would run into myself.\n\nAfter eating, moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be suicide because my tail is at (7,5). So I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (6,5), I should go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5), depending on the situation.\n\nBut for now, the priority is to get the apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe user's last move was from (8,5) to (7,5) by moving LEFT, and now I am at (7,5). So continuing LEFT to (6,5) makes sense.\n\nIs (6,5) still an apple? The board shows it as 'A' at row 5, column 6, which is (6,5). Yes.\n\nEnemy snake: they are at (6,7), which is directly above the apple. If they move DOWN to (6,6), then next turn they can move DOWN to (6,5). But if I move LEFT now, I take (6,5) before they can get there, since they need two moves to reach (6,5): DOWN to (6,6) then DOWN to (6,5). I only need one move to (6,5).\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nIf the enemy moves directly to where I am going? But they can't predict perfectly. Statistically, they might not move directly to (6,5) immediately.\n\nOther apples: (6,3) is below, which I could go for if I avoid the enemy, but (6,5) is closer.\n\n(3,5) is three cells left, but I can get (6,5) in one move.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating, go DOWN to (6,4) to avoid my tail and head toward (6,3) apple, unless the enemy is threatening.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple there. This is the closest apple and I can reach it in one move. The enemy at (6,7) is two cells away and cannot reach it before me if they move down. After eating, I'll have a body segment at my previous position (7,5), so I should avoid moving back there next turn. I can consider moving DOWN toward the (6,3) apple or LEFT toward (3,5) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

Since it's my own body, moving there would cause a collision and death.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- The enemy at (7,7) can move in any direction except possibly into walls or me, but currently no immediate threat.\n- They might go for the apple at (8,8) or (9,9), or even down toward (6,3) or (6,0).\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death \u2013 don't hit walls, myself, or enemy.\n2.

            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

Not efficient.\n- DOWN to (8,4): Takes me farther from (6,5) and toward (6,3), but that apple is less valuable since (6,5) is closer.\n- LEFT to (7,5): Gets me closer to (6,5).

My snake (ID 0) is at (7,5) with no body segments yet. There are apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0).

The enemy is at (6,7).\n\nApples: \n- (6,5) is adjacent to my left? From (7,5), (6,5) is one cell left.\n- (6,3) is two cells down from me? From (7,5) to (6,5) left, then (6,4) down, then (6,3) down again? \n- (3,5) is four cells left.\n- (9,9) is four cells right and four up.\n- (6,0) is one left and five down.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is the closest and I can reach it in one move by going LEFT.\n\nBut let me consider the enemy snake at (6,7). They are two cells above the apple at (6,5). They might be aiming for that apple too. If I move LEFT to (6,5), I will eat it. But what can the enemy do?\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake at (6,7):\n- UP: to (6,8) \u2013 away from the apple.\n- DOWN: to (6,6) \u2013 closer to the apple (6,5). Then next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5).\n- LEFT: to (5,7) \u2013 away from (6,5).\n- RIGHT: to (7,7) \u2013 away from the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they will be one cell above the apple. Then if I go LEFT to (6,5), I eat it before they can get there on their next move. Because from (6,6), they would need to go DOWN to (6,5), but by then I have already taken it.\n\nIf I don't move LEFT and go somewhere else, the enemy might get it.\n\nOther options for me:\n- UP: to (7,6) \u2013 no apple there, and it moves away from all apples except maybe (9,9) which is far.\n- DOWN: to (7,4) \u2013 closer to (6,3) apple, but (6,5) is closer and more immediate.\n- RIGHT: to (8,5) \u2013 away from most apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best to secure (6,5).\n\nBut what about safety? My body is empty, so no self-collision. The enemy is at (6,7), which is two cells up. If I move to (6,5), and enemy moves to (6,6), then we are adjacent but not colliding. Collision only happens if we occupy the same cell.\n\nAfter I eat the apple, my snake will grow, so next turn I will have a body segment at (7,5). Then I need to move from (6,5) to somewhere without hitting anything.\n\nPossible moves after eating:\n- From (6,5): UP to (6,6) \u2013 but if enemy is at (6,6), that would kill me if they are there. But I don't know where they will be.\n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 toward (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2013 but that's where my tail will be, so I would run into myself.\n\nAfter eating, moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be suicide because my tail is at (7,5). So I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (6,5), I should go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5), depending on the situation.\n\nBut for now, the priority is to get the apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe user's last move was from (8,5) to (7,5) by moving LEFT, and now I am at (7,5). So continuing LEFT to (6,5) makes sense.\n\nIs (6,5) still an apple? The board shows it as 'A' at row 5, column 6, which is (6,5). Yes.\n\nEnemy snake: they are at (6,7), which is directly above the apple. If they move DOWN to (6,6), then next turn they can move DOWN to (6,5). But if I move LEFT now, I take (6,5) before they can get there, since they need two moves to reach (6,5): DOWN to (6,6) then DOWN to (6,5). I only need one move to (6,5).\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nIf the enemy moves directly to where I am going? But they can't predict perfectly. Statistically, they might not move directly to (6,5) immediately.\n\nOther apples: (6,3) is below, which I could go for if I avoid the enemy, but (6,5) is closer.\n\n(3,5) is three cells left, but I can get (6,5) in one move.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating, go DOWN to (6,4) to avoid my tail and head toward (6,3) apple, unless the enemy is threatening.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple there. This is the closest apple and I can reach it in one move. The enemy at (6,7) is two cells away and cannot reach it before me if they move down. After eating, I'll have a body segment at my previous position (7,5), so I should avoid moving back there next turn. I can consider moving DOWN toward the (6,3) apple or LEFT toward (3,5) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

Since it's my own body, moving there would cause a collision and death.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- The enemy at (7,7) can move in any direction except possibly into walls or me, but currently no immediate threat.\n- They might go for the apple at (8,8) or (9,9), or even down toward (6,3) or (6,0).\n\nMy priorities:\n1.

Moving DOWN to (6,2) gets me closer.\n- After eating (6,0), I could grow and have options to go left or right.\n\nRisks:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,2), next turn I could go DOWN to (6,1) then (6,0) to eat the apple.\n- Enemy might become a threat if it grows, but right now it's small and far.\n\nStrategy:\n- Move DOWN to (6,2) to head toward (6,0) apple. This is efficient.\n- After eating (6,0), I'll have more body and can consider other apples like (3,5) or (4,6).\n- Avoid going toward enemy until necessary.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to (6,2). It's safe and progresses toward an apple.\n\n</think>\n\nDirection: DOWN",

            "rationale": "<think> \nFirst, I need to understand the game board. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. My snake (ID 0) is at (8,6) with no body segments yet, since the body is listed as empty []. That means I'm just a head right now, and I need to start growing.\n\nApples are at: (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), and (6,0). I should aim to eat one of these to grow.\n\nOpponent snake #1 is at (4,7) with no body either. So we're both small snakes just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- At row 9: ...A at (9,9)\n- At row 7: ...1 at (4,7) for snake #1\n- At row 6: ...0 at (8,6) for me\n- Apples at (6,5), (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0)\n\nMy position is (8,6). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: to (8,7) \u2013 safe? Nothing there now.\n- DOWN: to (8,5) \u2013 safe? Apple at (6,5) is not directly there, but I can move towards it.\n- LEFT: to (7,6) \u2013 safe? Not sure, but board seems empty.\n- RIGHT: to (9,6) \u2013 safe? Then I can go up to (9,7), then (9,8), and reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nBut let's think about priorities. I want to eat an apple without dying. The closest apples to me:\n- (6,5) is at distance |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (6,3) is |8-6| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5) is 5 + 1 = 6\n- (9,9) is 1 + 3 = 4\n- (6,0) is 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo (6,5) is closest at Manhattan distance 3. I could go DOWN to (8,5), then LEFT to (7,5), then LEFT to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's an enemy snake at (4,7). They might also be going for apples. I should avoid them for now since we're both small and crashing into each other would kill both, I assume.\n\nAnother option: the apple at (9,9). From (8,6), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), UP to (9,8), UP to (9,9). That's 3 moves to eat it. But while I'm doing that, the enemy might eat other apples.\n\nSince I'm at (8,6), and apple at (6,5) is close, going DOWN to (8,5) gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT twice to get it.\n\nBut is (8,5) safe? From the board, row 5 has an apple at (6,5), but no snakes mentioned, so should be fine.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. They're at (4,7). If they go RIGHT, they could go to (5,7), (6,7), etc. They might head for (6,5) or (3,5). (6,5) is closer to me than to them: to (6,5) from (4,7) is |4-6| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, so I can reach it in 3 moves, they in 4. So I have a slight advantage.\n\nBut I need to make the first move. Let me list possible moves:\n\n- UP to (8,7): this is away from (6,5) and not towards any immediate apple. Might be safe, but not productive.\n- DOWN to (8,5): this gets me closer to (6,5). Then I can go LEFT to (7,5), then (6,5) to eat.\n- LEFT to (7,6): this is horizontal move, closer to the center but not directly towards an apple. From (7,6), I could go DOWN to (7,5) then LEFT to (6,5), same as above but one extra move. Not efficient.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): this moves me towards the apple at (9,9), but it's farther and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nThe apple at (6,3) is also below, but farther. (6,0) is even farther.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to head towards (6,5).\n\nBut is there any danger? The enemy is at (4,7), which is not close to me. I'm at (8,6), they at (4,7), so no immediate threat.\n\nAlso, the board has no walls or other snakes. Just two snakes and apples.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning next turn I'll have a body segment. But since I'm just the head now, after eating, my body will be where I was, so I need to be careful not to run into myself.\n\nFor now, no body, so I can even go backwards if I wanted, but since no body, it's fine. Rules say: if you run into yourself (like go backwards), you die. But with no body, going to previous position might not be an issue? No, because after moving, the tail doesn't grow until I eat, but with no body, moving to previous spot should be okay? Let me think.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, you leave the tail behind. But here, since I have no body yet, moving doesn't create a tail. So if I go DOWN to (8,5), that's fine. Then if I go back UP to (8,6), that would be running into where I was, but since it's now empty, it should be okay? The rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning your own body segments.\n\nCurrently, body is [], so no segments. Therefore, after moving, (8,6) is empty. So going back is not a problem yet.\n\nBut once I eat an apple, I'll grow, and then (8,6) might become part of my body if I was there.\n\nFor this move, since no body, all directions are safe as long as not into wall or other snake.\n\nWalls: (8,6) to:\n\n- UP: (8,7) - y=7 is within 0-9, fine.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - y=5, fine.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - x=7, fine.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - x=9, which is the right edge, but since coordinates go to (9,9), x=9 is within bounds. (9,6) is a valid cell.\n\nNo snakes at any of these positions, from the board state.\n\nSo all moves are safe.\n\nBut DOWN gets me closer to the nearest apple (6,5).\n\nI could also consider going LEFT to (7,6) to be more central, but DOWN is better.\n\nAnother apple at (9,9) might be tempting, but it's farther.\n\nStrategy: I want to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Since the enemy is on the other side, I should focus on the apples near me.\n\nAfter this move, if I go DOWN to (8,5), then I can go LEFT to (7,5) or (7,6), etc. to reach (6,5).\n\nI should also think about blocking the enemy or something, but since we're both small, it's not critical yet.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems best.\n\nRationale: Move DOWN to (8,5) to approach the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n</think>\n\nI am currently at position (8,6) and want to eat the nearest apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN to (8,5) reduces the Manhattan distance to that apple from 3 to 2, putting me in a better position to reach it next turn. All directions are safe since there are no body segments or immediate threats. The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is not close, so no collision risk. For next turn, I should continue towards (6,5) unless a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN",

The enemy is at (6,7).\n\nApples: \n- (6,5) is adjacent to my left? From (7,5), (6,5) is one cell left.\n- (6,3) is two cells down from me? From (7,5) to (6,5) left, then (6,4) down, then (6,3) down again? \n- (3,5) is four cells left.\n- (9,9) is four cells right and four up.\n- (6,0) is one left and five down.\n\nThe apple at (6,5) is the closest and I can reach it in one move by going LEFT.\n\nBut let me consider the enemy snake at (6,7). They are two cells above the apple at (6,5). They might be aiming for that apple too. If I move LEFT to (6,5), I will eat it. But what can the enemy do?\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake at (6,7):\n- UP: to (6,8) \u2013 away from the apple.\n- DOWN: to (6,6) \u2013 closer to the apple (6,5). Then next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5).\n- LEFT: to (5,7) \u2013 away from (6,5).\n- RIGHT: to (7,7) \u2013 away from the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they will be one cell above the apple. Then if I go LEFT to (6,5), I eat it before they can get there on their next move. Because from (6,6), they would need to go DOWN to (6,5), but by then I have already taken it.\n\nIf I don't move LEFT and go somewhere else, the enemy might get it.\n\nOther options for me:\n- UP: to (7,6) \u2013 no apple there, and it moves away from all apples except maybe (9,9) which is far.\n- DOWN: to (7,4) \u2013 closer to (6,3) apple, but (6,5) is closer and more immediate.\n- RIGHT: to (8,5) \u2013 away from most apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT seems best to secure (6,5).\n\nBut what about safety? My body is empty, so no self-collision. The enemy is at (6,7), which is two cells up. If I move to (6,5), and enemy moves to (6,6), then we are adjacent but not colliding. Collision only happens if we occupy the same cell.\n\nAfter I eat the apple, my snake will grow, so next turn I will have a body segment at (7,5). Then I need to move from (6,5) to somewhere without hitting anything.\n\nPossible moves after eating:\n- From (6,5): UP to (6,6) \u2013 but if enemy is at (6,6), that would kill me if they are there. But I don't know where they will be.\n- DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 toward (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT to (7,5) \u2013 but that's where my tail will be, so I would run into myself.\n\nAfter eating, moving RIGHT to (7,5) would be suicide because my tail is at (7,5). So I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, after eating the apple at (6,5), I should go DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5), depending on the situation.\n\nBut for now, the priority is to get the apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe user's last move was from (8,5) to (7,5) by moving LEFT, and now I am at (7,5). So continuing LEFT to (6,5) makes sense.\n\nIs (6,5) still an apple? The board shows it as 'A' at row 5, column 6, which is (6,5). Yes.\n\nEnemy snake: they are at (6,7), which is directly above the apple. If they move DOWN to (6,6), then next turn they can move DOWN to (6,5). But if I move LEFT now, I take (6,5) before they can get there, since they need two moves to reach (6,5): DOWN to (6,6) then DOWN to (6,5). I only need one move to (6,5).\n\nSo I should go for it.\n\nIf the enemy moves directly to where I am going? But they can't predict perfectly. Statistically, they might not move directly to (6,5) immediately.\n\nOther apples: (6,3) is below, which I could go for if I avoid the enemy, but (6,5) is closer.\n\n(3,5) is three cells left, but I can get (6,5) in one move.\n\nSo I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating, go DOWN to (6,4) to avoid my tail and head toward (6,3) apple, unless the enemy is threatening.\n\nMove: LEFT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple there. This is the closest apple and I can reach it in one move. The enemy at (6,7) is two cells away and cannot reach it before me if they move down. After eating, I'll have a body segment at my previous position (7,5), so I should avoid moving back there next turn. I can consider moving DOWN toward the (6,3) apple or LEFT toward (3,5) depending on the enemy's position.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

This means I have one body segment behind me at (7,5).\n- Apples are at (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0), and (8,8). The apple at (6,5) was eaten in the last move, so it should be gone now.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with no body segments (empty list).\n\nBoard visualization (with current positions):\n  y=9: . . . . . . . . . A  (A at (9,9))\n  y=8: . . . . . . . . A .  (A at (8,8))\n  y=7: . . . . . . . 1 . .  (enemy at (7,7))\n  y=6: . . . . . . . . . .\n  y=5: . . . A . . 0 T . .

A . . .  (A at (6,0))\n    x: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nKey points:\n- I am at (6,5) facing left from (7,5) after moving LEFT last turn.\n- My tail is at (7,5).\n- Apples available: (6,3), (3,5), (9,9), (6,0), (8,8).\n- Enemy at (7,7) with no body, so they can move freely.\n\nPossible moves for me:\n- UP: to (6,6) \u2013 empty space.\n- DOWN: to (6,4) \u2013 empty space, closer to (6,3) apple.\n- LEFT: to (5,5) \u2013 empty space, toward (3,5) apple.\n- RIGHT: to (7,5) \u2013 but that's my tail position. Since it's my own body, moving there would cause a collision and death.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is not an option.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- The enemy at (7,7) can move in any direction except possibly into walls or me, but currently no immediate threat.\n- They might go for the apple at (8,8) or (9,9), or even down toward (6,3) or (6,0).\n\nMy priorities:\n1. Avoid death \u2013 don't hit walls, myself, or enemy.\n2. Collect apples to grow and score points.\n\nPath options:\n- If I go UP to (6,6): \n  - This moves me away from most apples except (9,9) which is far. \n  - Enemy at (7,7) could move RIGHT to (8,7) or UP to (7,8), not directly threatening me immediately.\n  - But it's inefficient for apple collection.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,4):\n  - One step closer to (6,3) apple. I can eat it next turn by moving DOWN again to (6,3).\n  - Also positions me for (6,0) later.\n  - Safe as no immediate threats.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,5):\n  - Moves toward (3,5) apple, which is three moves away (LEFT to (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5)).\n  - Also safe.\n\nComparing DOWN vs LEFT:\n- (6,3) apple is two moves away if I go DOWN (to (6,4) then to (6,3)).\n- (3,5) apple is three moves away if I go LEFT (to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)).\n- (6,3) is closer in terms of moves required from my current position.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is directly below me, so DOWN is the most direct path to an apple.\n\nRisks:\n- Enemy might be moving toward (6,3) as well. From (7,7), they could go DOWN to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6) or (6,5), but since I'm at (6,5), they might avoid collision. If they go DOWN multiple times, they could reach (7,3) or similar, but not directly threatening (6,3) immediately.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), I can consider:\n- Continuing DOWN to (6,2) toward (6,0) apple.\n- Or moving LEFT toward (3,5) if enemy is not there.\n\nFor now, DOWN seems optimal to get to the nearest apple quickly.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (6,4), if the apple is still at (6,3), move DOWN again to eat it. Watch out for enemy movements.\n\nTherefore, my move will be DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,4) to head toward the apple at (6,3). This is the closest apple and positions me for future moves while avoiding my tail. Next turn, I plan to continue DOWN to (6,3) if possible.\n\nDirection: DOWN",

Now my body includes (6,4) and (6,5).\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (9,7) with no body yet.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (6,3):\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2013 that's my own body!

DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe now.\n- Eat apples: I should go for the closest one. (6,0) is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (6,2) gets me closer.\n- After eating (6,0), I could grow and have options to go left or right.\n\nRisks:\n- If I go DOWN to (6,2), next turn I could go DOWN to (6,1) then (6,0) to eat the apple.\n- Enemy might become a threat if it grows, but right now it's small and far.\n\nStrategy:\n- Move DOWN to (6,2) to head toward (6,0) apple.
