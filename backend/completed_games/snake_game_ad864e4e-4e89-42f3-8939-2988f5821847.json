          "rationale": "Let's analyze the situation. I'm snake #2, currently positioned at (3, 4). I need to move towards an apple to gain points. The closest apples to me are at (5, 8) and (4, 7). However, I also need to be cautious of the enemy snake #1 at (0, 8) and the wall boundaries.\n\nI think I'll move towards the apple at (4, 7) first, as it's closer to me than the apple at (5, 8). I'll try to move down to (4, 5) and then up to (4, 7) in the next few turns.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns is to move down to (4, 5) and then up to (4, 7), and then reassess the situation from there.\n\nSince I'm already at (3, 4) and I want to move down to (4, 5), I should move DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."
