Moving RIGHT would move me closer to the apple at (9, 1), but also potentially into the enemy snake's body. Moving DOWN is currently safe because it avoids all threats.\n\n2. **Evaluating potential moves:**\n   - **DOWN:** This is the safest option. It moves me further away from the enemy snake and brings me closer to the apple at (2, 0). It also allows me to explore other options.\n   - **RIGHT:** While it gets me closer to the apple at (9, 1), it puts me in a potential collision with the enemy snake's head and potentially gets me back into my own snake's body if the enemy moves and I then backtrack.\n   - **UP:** This move is directly into the enemy's snake, a guaranteed death.\n   - **LEFT:** Also directly into the enemy's snake.\n\n3. **Decision:** Based on the analysis, the safest and most promising move is DOWN. This allows me to continue growing and collecting apples without immediate danger.\n\nLong-term plan: I will prioritize collecting apples in the lower part of the board, keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake while also expanding my reach.

Also, it will increase the chances of a collision with snake #0 if it moves up.\n*   **DOWN:** This is a viable option!

My goal is to collect more apples while avoiding Snake #0, which is at (8, 1).\nThe apples are at (4, 1), (2, 0), (4, 2), (1, 6), and (0, 4). The closest apples to me that are safe are (2, 0) and (4, 1).  Moving right to (2, 5) gives me access to (2, 0) and further away from Snake #0. Moving down to (1,4) gives me access to (4,1).\n\nI should consider options that give me the most potential for growth, while minimizing risks. While the apple at (2,0) is close by, moving right just gets me more distance away. Moving down to (1,4) seems like the safer option.\n\nLet's consider the movement of Snake #0. It's at (8, 1). If #0 moves up, it will likely go to (8, 2). If #0 moves right, it goes to (9, 1). If #0 moves left, it goes to (7, 1). If #0 moves down, it goes to (8, 0). The worst-case scenario would be #0 moving upwards.

I need to find a safe move to increase my apple count while avoiding Snake #0.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves:\n*   **UP:**  (1, 1).  This takes me closer to the apple at (4,1), but leaves me vulnerable to Snake #0's potential move to (8,2), making a follow up move difficult.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 3). This puts me closer to the apple at (4,2).\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 2). This puts me closer to the apple at (2,0), but also puts me closer to Snake #0 if they move. I would be very close to the board boundary.\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 2). This move puts me directly in the path of Snake #0's head movement if it moves. Also, it is just a little closer to the apple at (4,1), but less favorable.\n\nI would prefer to go down since it is more likely I will reach an apple that does not lead to an imminent collision.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMoving down from (1,2) to (1,3) is a safe move. This brings me closer to the apple at (4,2). It allows for a follow up move to the apple at (4,1) which is about as close as it will get by moving down. Considering Snake #0's current position at (8,2), I need to be cautious about any move that puts me in close proximity to its head movement. Moving down provides a safer option.\n\n**PLAN NOTE:** Continue attempting to move closer to the apple at (4,1). If the snake doesn't move, continue pursuing optimal moves. If the snake does move, readjust and consider a different direction.\n\nUP\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN\nDOWN",

However, this puts me on the board boundary and vulnerable to Snake #0.\n*   **DOWN:** (1, 1) - Moves me closer to the apple at (4, 2) and avoids a collision with Snake #0.\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 2) -  Moves me closer to the apple at (2, 0), but also is very close to snake #0 if it moves.\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 0) - Moves me closer to the apple at (2, 0). Also, moves me closer to the snake if it moves.\n\nI should choose **DOWN** to minimize risk given that snakes #0 is very close to my location.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nMoving down from (1, 0) to (1, 1) is the safest course of action.
