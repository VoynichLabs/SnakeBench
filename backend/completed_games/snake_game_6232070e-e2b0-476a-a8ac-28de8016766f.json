Moving LEFT to (3, 2) or DOWN to (5, 2) would not result in eating an apple and would put the snake in a position where it could potentially collide with the enemy snake if the enemy snake moves to (3, 1) on its next turn.\n\nSince the enemy snake is trying to trap us, and moving UP or RIGHT allows us to eat an apple without colliding with the enemy snake, either move is reasonable. However, moving RIGHT to (4, 1) allows us to eat an apple and potentially position ourselves better to avoid the enemy snake's trap.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",
