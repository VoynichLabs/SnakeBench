          "rationale": "<think>Alright, let me analyze the situation. The snake I'm controlling is at (8,1), which is near the right edge of the board. The apples are located at (9,1), (6,6), (3,1), (0,2), and (4,6). My snake is currently at (8,1), so the closest apple is right next to it at (9,1). That seems like the most immediate target.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake, Snake #0 is at (9,0), which is below me. Since both snakes are at the edge, I need to be careful not to run into each other. If I move right to (9,1), I can grab that apple and grow. That would also put me closer to the enemy snake, but since I'm moving towards the apple, it's worth the risk.\n\nI should check if moving right is possible. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So moving right from (8,1) would take me to (9,1), which is a valid move and where the apple is located. That seems like the best move because it allows me to collect an apple and gain a point.\n\nI also need to consider the other apples. After getting the one at (9,1), I could head towards the next closest apple, maybe (6,6) or (3,1). But for now, focusing on the immediate apple is the priority. Additionally, I should avoid moving down to (8,0) because that's where the enemy snake is, and moving into it would cause me to lose.\n\nSo, the plan is to move right to (9,1) to collect the apple, grow, and then assess the next move from there. I need to make sure that after moving, I'm not positioning myself in a way that the enemy can block me or that I run into myself. Since my snake's body is currently empty, there's no risk of self-collision yet, but after eating the apple, the body will grow, so future moves need to be cautious.\n\nI should also think about the enemy's possible moves. Snake #0 is at (9,0). If it moves up, it would go to (9,1), which is where I'm planning to go. That could lead to a collision. So, perhaps I should be cautious, but since I'm moving first, I can take the apple before the enemy can react. Alternatively, maybe the enemy is also trying to get to that apple, but given the positions, I'm closer.\n\nAnother consideration is the board's edges. Moving right to (9,1) is safe since it's within the board's boundaries. If I were to move further right beyond (9,1), that would be outside the board, which is not allowed. So, (9,1) is the maximum right I can go without hitting a wall.\n\nIn summary, moving right to collect the apple at (9,1) is the optimal move. It's the closest apple, and it's within safe reach without immediate threats. After that, I can reassess the board state and plan the next move accordingly.\n\n</think>\n\nI should move right to (9,1) to collect the apple. This is the closest apple to my current position and will allow me to grow. I need to make sure not to collide with the enemy snake at (9,0). After collecting this apple, I can look for the next closest apple, possibly at (6,6) or (3,1). I should continue to avoid the enemy and any walls to stay alive and gain more points.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",

If I move directly **UP (9, 1)**, I risk colliding with the enemy snake **#1** at **(8, 1)**, so UP may not be safe.\n2. Moving **LEFT (9, 0)** will take me toward the wall, but that wall is farther away. It could prevent growth immediately, and it doesn\u2019t let me reach an apple quickly.\n3. Moving **DOWN (9, 0)** would move me in the direction of the wall at **(9, 9)** but doesn\u2019t give access to apples immediately.\n4. Moving **RIGHT (9, 0)** seems to provide the best initial path to avoid the wall and get closer to apples, especially **(6, 6)** or **(3, 1)**.\n\n### Strategy for Next Move:\n\nFor this turn, I\u2019ll avoid colliding with walls or snakes by **moving RIGHT**.
