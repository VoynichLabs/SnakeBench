It can move in any direction, but its current position is far from mine, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n#### Long-Term Strategy:\n- Since I have no body, I can explore the board safely without worrying about my own body blocking me.\n- The apples at (3,0) and (6,6) are reachable, but (3,0) is closer (3 steps left vs 6 steps up).\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0) is a good first step toward (3,0) without immediately committing to a path that might block future options.\n- Alternatively, moving UP to (6,1) keeps me near the bottom but doesn't immediately threaten to trap me.\n\n#### Decision:\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0) is the best choice because:\n  - It starts me on a path toward the apple at (3,0) without immediately committing to a dead-end.\n  - It keeps my options open for future moves (can still go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT further).\n  - It doesn't risk getting trapped near the edge (since RIGHT would keep me at x=7, which is also safe but less optimal for apple access).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n- Prioritize moving toward the apple at (3,0) by continuing LEFT.\n- Avoid moving too close to the enemy snake (currently at (9,5), far away but monitor its movement).\n- If the enemy snake moves toward me, adjust to avoid collisions.\n- If an apple becomes reachable in fewer steps, prioritize it over the current path.\n\n### Final Move:\nLEFT",
