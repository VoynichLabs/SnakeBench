The enemy snake 0 is at (7, 0).\nThere are apples at (8, 2), (5, 1), (3, 1), (8, 1), and (0, 5).\n\nMy current position is (7, 3).\nPossible moves: UP to (7, 4), DOWN to (7, 2), LEFT to (6, 3), RIGHT to (8, 3).\n\n1.  **Safety Check:** Since both snakes are length 1, no moves lead into anyone's body or tail immediately. Only boundary and head-on collisions are a concern.\n\n    *   (7, 4) UP: Safe.\n    *   (7, 2) DOWN: Safe.\n    *   (6, 3) LEFT: Safe.\n    *   (8, 3) RIGHT: Safe.\n\n2.  **Head-on Collision Check:** The enemy is at (7, 0).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (7, 2), and the enemy moves UP twice to (7, 2), we meet. But this is Turn 0, so only one move is considered.\n    *   Enemy's possible moves: UP to (7, 1), DOWN (off board, unlikely), LEFT to (6, 0), RIGHT to (8, 0).\n    *   The enemy cannot reach my position (7, 3) or any adjacent cell in one move. No immediate head-on risk.\n\n3.  **Apple Proximity:**\n    Apples are at: A1=(8, 2), A2=(5, 1), A3=(3, 1), A4=(8, 1), A5=(0, 5).\n\n    *   (7, 4) UP: Distance to A5=(0, 5) is Manhattan distance 7. Nothing immediately close.\n    *   (7, 2) DOWN: Closer to A1=(8, 2) and A4=(8, 1). Distance to A1 is 1 (if I move RIGHT next turn). If I move DOWN, I'm at (7, 2).\n    *   (6, 3) LEFT: Distance to A2=(5, 1) is 3. Distance to A3=(3, 1) is 4.\n    *   (8, 3) RIGHT: Distance to A1=(8, 2) is 1. If I move RIGHT, I'm at (8, 3). A1 is reachable with DOWN next turn.\n\n4.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    Apples A1, A2, A3, A4 are in the lower half of the board. A5 is far to the top left.\n    The enemy is at (7, 0), also near the bottom, specifically near A1, A2, A3, A4.\n\n    *   Moving UP or LEFT seems to move me away from the densest apple cluster (A1, A2, A3, A4).\n    *   Moving DOWN or RIGHT seems most promising for apple acquisition.\n\n    Let's compare DOWN and RIGHT:\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (8, 3):** I am adjacent to A1 (8, 2). Next turn I can move DOWN to (8, 2) and eat A1. The enemy might try to get to the lower apples too. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 0) or UP to (7, 1), they are still far from A1. This path looks efficient.\n    *   **Move DOWN to (7, 2):** I am also adjacent to A1 (8, 2) (Manhattan distance 1). Next turn I can move RIGHT to (8, 2) and eat A1. This is also efficient.\n\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 3), I secure a position slightly further right, giving me options for A1 (8, 2) and A4 (8, 1).\n    If I move DOWN to (7, 2), I also target A1, but remain centered. This might be slightly more dangerous if the enemy immediately heads towards center/upwards quickly.\n\n    Let's check the enemy's likely moves. Enemy (7, 0) is very close to the bottom edge.\n    *   Enemy is likely to move UP to (7, 1) to access the lower apples (A2, A3, A4) or RIGHT to (8, 0) to potentially target A4 (8, 1).\n\n    If I move RIGHT (8, 3):\n    T1: Snake 1 -> (8, 3). Next target: (8, 2) [A1].\n    If enemy goes UP to (7, 1), they are close to A4 (8, 1).\n    If enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 0), they are also close to A4 (8, 1).\n\n    If I move DOWN (7, 2):\n    T1: Snake 1 -> (7, 2). Next target: (8, 2) [A1].\n    If enemy goes UP to (7, 1). They are very close to me. Head distance is 1.\n\n    Moving RIGHT seems slightly safer in terms of immediate proximity to the enemy, and still positions me perfectly for A1.\n\n    Let's choose RIGHT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Target the cluster of apples (A1, A4, A2, A3) in the southern half of the map. Prioritize A1 (8, 2) first, followed by A4 (8, 1). Need to monitor the enemy's progress towards A2/A3 (5, 1), (3, 1).\nT1: (7, 3) -> RIGHT (8, 3).\nT2: (8, 3) -> DOWN (8, 2) [Eat A1].\n\nRIGHT",

Apple Acquisition:**\n\nI am targeting A1 at (8, 2).\n*   Moving DOWN to (8, 2) *is* eating an apple. This is the highest priority move.\n\nThe enemy at (8, 0) is very close to A4 at (8, 1).\n*   If the enemy moves UP, they eat A4 (8, 1).\n\n**4. Strategic Analysis:**\n\nI have a direct shot at A1 (8, 2) by moving DOWN. This is an objective move.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (8, 1) (to eat A4):\n*   My head: (8, 2)\n*   Enemy head: (8, 1)\nBoth snakes successfully eat apples and grow to length 2. My new tail is at (8, 3). Enemy new tail is at (8, 0). This is a great outcome for me.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (7, 0) or RIGHT to (9, 0):\n*   I still eat A1 at (8, 2). The enemy moves away from their closest apple (A4). This is also a good outcome for me.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 2) is safe, guarantees an apple, and fulfills the immediate tactical goal established in the previous turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for next turn (Turn 2):**\nIf I move DOWN, I will be at (8, 2). I will be length 2, tail at (8, 3).\nThe enemy will likely be at (8, 1) (if they target A4) or elsewhere.\nIf the enemy is at (8, 1), the immediate vicinity is dense with bodies/apples.\nApples remaining: (5, 1), (3, 1), (0, 5).\nIf I eat A1, and Enemy eats A4:\nMy head (8, 2), body (8, 3).\nEnemy head (8, 1), body (8, 0).\nNext turn (T2), I would need to decide whether to move LEFT (7, 2) or UP (8, 3 is blocked by my body/tail, but since I grew, the tail occupies (8, 3) *after* the move. Wait, my previous position (8, 3) becomes my tail segment, so the cell (8, 3) is occupied. Moving UP to (8, 3) means hitting my own body. I must not go UP.)\nWait, when a snake eats an apple, the tail extension happens *after* the move. The cell (8, 3) becomes the first body segment, but since I grew, the old head position is now occupied by the body.\nMy position on T1: H(8, 3). Move DOWN. New H(8, 2). Old H(8, 3) becomes B1.\nIf I grow, the new tail segment is added, but since I started at length 1, B1 is (8, 3).\nThe cell (8, 3) will be occupied by my body. I cannot move UP to (8, 3) on Turn 2.\n\nT2 Safe Moves from (8, 2): DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2). UP (8, 3) is blocked by my own body.\nSince the enemy is likely at (8, 1), moving DOWN to (8, 1) is a head-on collision risk if they remain stationary or if they move 1 space away and come back. But if they ate A4 (8, 1), they grew and their new head is (8, 1). I cannot move there.\n\nIf Enemy took (8, 1) (A4):\nMy head (8, 2), body (8, 3).\nEnemy head (8, 1), body (8, 0).\nT2: I must move LEFT or RIGHT. Moving DOWN to (8, 1) is instant death (hitting enemy body/head).\n\nSo, moving DOWN to (8, 2) is the correct move for Turn 1.\nDOWN",

The apple they ate must have been at (8, 1). This is also not on the list of remaining apples.\n\nConclusion: The apples at (8, 2) and (8, 1) were eaten in Turn 1. The current list accurately reflects the remaining apples.\n\n**My Current Position and Potential Moves:**\nHead (8, 2). Body/Tail occupies (8, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** DEAD. Hitting my own body/tail segment (8, 3).\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** Hitting Enemy Head (8, 1). **DEAD** (Head-on collision, if Enemy moves away). If Enemy stays (8, 1), it's a collision with Enemy Head. This is highly risky or definite death.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** Apple! Hitting Apple (7, 2). Safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe move.\n\n**Safety Check & Elimination:**\n*   UP (8, 3): Fatal. Eliminate.\n*   DOWN (8, 1): Fatal (Enemy Head is there). Eliminate.\n\n**Remaining Safe Moves:** LEFT (7, 2) and RIGHT (9, 2).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy Head (8, 1). Body/Tail occupies (8, 0).\nEnemy's possible moves:\n1.  UP to (8, 2): Collision with My Head (8, 2). **MUTUAL DEATH** (Head-on collision).\n2.  DOWN to (8, 0): DEAD. Hitting own body/tail segment (8, 0).\n3.  LEFT to (7, 1): Safe.\n4.  RIGHT to (9, 1): Safe.\n\nWe must assume the enemy plays optimally (or at least rationally).\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n**1. Moving LEFT to (7, 2) (Apple):**\nThis is an apple acquisition move.\nIf I move LEFT, I eat (7, 2) and grow to length 3. My new head is (7, 2). My body is [(8, 2), (8, 3)].\n\n*   **Enemy counter-moves:**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (8, 2): They hit my previous head position (8, 2) which is now a body segment. **Enemy dies.** I survive and get the apple. **Excellent outcome.**\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (7, 1): They move towards the center/left apples. We are safe from collision. Good outcome.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 1): They move away. Safe. Good outcome.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 2) is very strong as it acquires an apple and potentially kills the enemy if they attempt to move UP (which is a reasonable blocking move if they were trying to prevent me from expanding, although there are no immediate apples there for them). Since (8, 2) was my head, they might consider it safe, but since I am eating an apple, (8, 2) becomes a solid body segment.\n\n**2. Moving RIGHT to (9, 2) (Safe Move):**\nThis moves me further away from the enemy and into the corner. It is safe but non-aggressive and doesn't get an apple.\nIf I move RIGHT, H(9, 2), Body [(8, 2), (8, 3)].\n\n*   **Enemy counter-moves:**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (8, 2): They hit my body segment (8, 2). **Enemy dies.** I survive. (Same outcome as above regarding the enemy dying.)\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT/RIGHT: We are safe.\n\n**Comparison of LEFT vs RIGHT:**\nBoth moves carry the threat of killing Snake 0 if Snake 0 attempts to move UP to (8, 2). Crucially, since I grew last turn, (8, 2) is a body segment IF I eat an apple this turn. Wait, no. (8, 2) is my head currently. If I move, (8, 2) becomes B1 (body segment 1). If I eat an apple, (8, 2) remains B1 and my total length increases. If I don't eat an apple, (8, 3) falls off, (8, 2) becomes the tail, and the length remains 2.\n\nLet's re-verify the rules for body segmentation when moving without eating:\nH(8, 2), B1(8, 3).\nMove LEFT to H(7, 2).\nIf I **eat** at (7, 2): New H(7, 2), B1(8, 2), B2(8, 3). Length 3. (8, 2) is a solid body piece.\nIf I **don't eat** (Move RIGHT to (9, 2)): New H(9, 2), B1(8, 2). The tail (8, 3) disappears. Length 2. (8, 2) is a solid body piece.\n\nIn *both* cases (LEFT or RIGHT), (8, 2) becomes a body segment.\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (8, 2), they hit my body: **Snake 0 dies.**\n\nTherefore, I have a strong advantage: no matter what safe move I take, the enemy is immediately cornered into moving LEFT or RIGHT or dying.\n\nSince both LEFT and RIGHT movements guarantee safety for me and put pressure on the enemy, I should choose the move that yields an apple.\n\n**Move Decision: LEFT**\n*   I move LEFT to (7, 2) and eat the apple.\n*   Snake 0 is forced to move LEFT or RIGHT, or they die attempting to move UP to (8, 2). They cannot move DOWN (self-collision).\n*   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (7, 1), they open up space.\n*   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 1), they move towards the wall.\n\nIf I move LEFT, my new position is H(7, 2), L=3.\nApples remaining: (5, 1), (3, 1), (0, 5), (5, 0).\nI have better control of the middle right side of the board.\n\nThis seems like the optimal move: maximizes gain (apple) while maximizing defensive strength (creating a blocking segment at (8, 2)).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nNext turn (T3), I will be at (7, 2), length 3. I will look to move down towards (3, 1) and (5, 1), or perhaps target (0, 5). The enemy will likely be at (7, 1) or (9, 1). If they are at (7, 1), moving DOWN to (7, 1) would likely intersect them. I will prioritize moving towards the left side of the board to collect the cluster of apples there and potentially trap Snake 0 against the right wall.\n\nLEFT",

Head-on collision or collision with my body if I move away.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):** Safe and clear.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):** Safe and clear.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):** Hitting own body segment (8, 1). **DEAD**.\n\n**Mutual Collision Consideration: (7, 2) and (7, 1)**\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (7, 1) and Enemy moves UP to (7, 2), we cross paths but do not collide head-on. I occupy (7, 1), Enemy occupies (7, 2). *Wait, if they move UP to (7, 2), they hit my LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) head spot.*\n    *   My current head is (7, 2). My body is B[(8, 2), (8, 3)].\n    *   If I move DOWN to (7, 1) (no apple): My new body is B[(7, 2), (8, 2)]. (8, 3) falls off.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (7, 2): They hit my body segment (7, 2). **Enemy dies.** I survive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (7, 1) is safe for me, but it is high-pressure for the enemy if they mistakenly move UP. However, if the enemy *also* moves DOWN or LEFT, I gain nothing and put myself right against them.\n\n*   If I move UP (7, 3) or LEFT (6, 2): I am completely safe.\n*   If Enemy moves UP to (7, 2): They collide with my current head position (7, 2). Since I am moving away, (7, 2) becomes a body segment. **Enemy dies.**\n\nThis is a critical observation: The enemy cannot move UP this turn without hitting my body (7, 2) *unless* I were to die or move into an apple at (7, 3) or (6, 2) such that my tail at (8, 3) did not move (i.e., I grew and (8, 2) became solid).\n\nLet's check the body maintenance rule when not eating an apple:\nH(7, 2), B[(8, 2), (8, 3)].\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2) (no apple): New H(6, 2), B[(7, 2), (8, 2)]. Tail (8, 3) is released. Length remains 3.\n\n**Crucial Point:** Since I ate an apple last turn, my length is 3, and my tail (8, 3) will be retained if I eat a second apple. If I do not eat an apple (e.g., move UP or LEFT), the tail (8, 3) is released, and my body shrinks back to length 3 (Head + 2 segments).\n\nWait, the provided body list for my snake is: Head: (7, 2), Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3)]. Length is 3. Apples collected is 2.\nMy previous move rationale confirms I ate an apple at (7, 2) on Turn 2, growing my length from 2 to 3.\n\nIf I move UP (7, 3) (no apple):\nNew H: (7, 3)\nNew B: [(7, 2), (8, 2)]\nDead cell: (8, 3) (tail segment)\n\nIf the Enemy moves UP to (7, 2), they hit the new body segment **(7, 2)** and **DIE**.\n\nThis means my position H(7, 2) creates a kill zone for the enemy if they try to move into it (UP). This is a strong deterrent.\n\n**Optimal Strategy:**\nI need to capitalize on the enemy restriction while moving towards the next apple cluster. The apples (5, 1), (3, 1), and (5, 0) are nearby in the bottom left quadrant.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 2):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Puts me closer to the central apples (5, 1) and (3, 1).\n    *   Maintains the kill zone at (7, 2).\n    *   Enemy will likely move DOWN (7, 0) or LEFT (6, 1).\n        *   If Enemy moves (6, 1): We are adjacent. I can potentially move DOWN next turn to (6, 1) if they move away, or try to go for (5, 2) or (5, 1).\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 3):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Puts me slightly further from the immediate apple cluster, but sets me up to potentially move LATERALLY or towards (2, 6).\n    *   Maintains the kill zone at (7, 2).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 1):**\n    *   High risk of mutual collision if Enemy also moves DOWN to (7, 0) and I trap myself.\n    *   If Enemy stays LEFT (6, 1), I block their path to the bottom.\n    *   This is an aggressive move right into the face of the opponent. Since the enemy has safe moves (DOWN, LEFT), they are unlikely to commit to the deadly UP move, meaning I won't get the kill, but I will be right next to them. This might lead to a quick block or capture, but I am smaller (length 3 vs length 2), so trapping them is hard right now.\n\nGiven the cluster of uncollected apples (5, 1), (3, 1), (5, 0), moving LEFT is the most efficient choice for apple collection and preparing for potential future dominance of the lower half.\n\nLet's choose **LEFT** (6, 2).\n\n**If I move LEFT to (6, 2):**\n*   My Head: (6, 2). Length 3.\n*   Enemy likely moves LEFT to (6, 1) or DOWN to (7, 0).\n    *   If Enemy (6, 1): Next turn, I can move DOWN (6, 1) if they move away, or continue LEFT to (5, 2).\n    *   If Enemy (7, 0): They are moving away from the (3, 1), (5, 1) apples. Good.\n\nMoving LEFT is the most direct route to the next set of objectives.\n\n---\n*Self-Correction/Sanity Check:*\nIs the move RIGHT (8, 2) truly fatal?\nMy body is [(8, 2), (8, 3)]. (8, 2) is the segment immediately behind my head (7, 2). Moving from (7, 2) to (8, 2) is moving backwards into the first body segment. This is a fatal self-collision. Confirmed: RIGHT is deadly.\n\nIs moving DOWN (7, 1) too risky?\nIf I move DOWN (7, 1) and the Enemy moves LEFT (6, 1) or DOWN (7, 0), I survive.\nIf Enemy moves UP (7, 2), they hit my body block and die.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (7, 0), they are safe.\nIf I move DOWN (7, 1), I still have the possibility for another move (LEFT to 6, 1 or DOWN to 7, 0).\nThe risk is only if the Enemy moved exactly into (7, 1) at the same time, which would be a head-on collision. Since the enemy also has safe moves available (LEFT, DOWN), moving towards me is not their optimal move unless they try to block or intercept me. Given the uncertainty, moves UP and LEFT are safer.\n\nI stick with **LEFT** to aggressively pursue apples while maintaining a strong defensive position.\n\nLEFT",

The cluster of apples in the South (5, 1), (3, 1), (5, 0) is important.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 2), I stay competitive for the lower apples and potentially cut off the enemy's path to (3, 1) later.\n\nLet's assume the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 1) to eat the apple.\nState after turn 4:\nMe: H(5, 2), B[(6, 2), (7, 2)] (Length 3)\nEnemy: H(5, 1), B[(6, 1), (7, 1)] (Length 3, grew)\n\nThis setup keeps me positioned well to contest the remaining apples in the lower area (3, 1) and (5, 0).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 3), I give up too much territory too early. The enemy will consolidate power in the bottom and grow rapidly.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (5, 2) is the best choice to maintain pressure and pursue local apples.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:** Focus on eating the remaining lower apples (3, 1, 5, 0) and controlling the center of the board. I need to be careful of the enemy snake now at length 3, as it will start to take up more space.\n\nLEFT",

Moves towards apple (3, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Hitting own body segment (6, 1). **DEAD**.\n\n**Enemy's Strategic Outlook:**\nThe enemy has a clear path to the apple at (5, 0) by moving DOWN. This is the most logical and beneficial move for them. They gained length last turn, putting us equal at 3 segments.\n\n**Strategic Considerations for My Move (H=5, 2):**\n\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (5, 0) (eating the apple):\n*   Enemy state: H'(5, 0), B'[(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]. Length 4. Apples 3.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 3):\n*   I retreat from the lower area, allowing the enemy to gain length and control the bottom.\n*   I position myself for potentially slower-to-reach apples (2, 6), (6, 7), (0, 5).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 2):\n*   I move closer to the apple at (3, 1).\n*   I stay competitive in the lower area.\n*   I maintain a central position.\n\nSince the enemy is highly likely to take (5, 0) and grow, I should aim for the next closest apple: (3, 1). Moving LEFT to (4, 2) sets me up perfectly for this. If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 1), we will be side-by-side on the Y=1 and Y=2 rows, both heading towards (3, 1). This is a race I can afford to enter, as (4, 2) is slightly more central/open than (4, 1).\n\nIf the enemy makes an aggressively poor move (like trying to move UP to (5, 2)), the game is a draw due to simultaneous head-on collision, which is not ideal, but moving LEFT is safe regardless of what they choose.\n\nMoving LEFT maintains pressure, secures a path to a nearby apple ((3, 1)), and avoids unnecessary retreat.\n\n**Simulated Turn 5 (Assuming Enemy moves DOWN to (5, 0)):**\n*   My Move: LEFT -> (4, 2)\n*   Enemy Move: DOWN -> (5, 0) (Eats apple)\n*   State T+1:\n    *   Me: H(4, 2), B[(5, 2), (6, 2)] (Length 3)\n    *   Enemy: H(5, 0), B[(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)] (Length 4)\n*   Next turn I would aim for (3, 2) or (3, 1) (eating apple).\n\nThis sequence seems optimal: I secure my position for the next apple while avoiding confrontation and letting the enemy eat an apple (which they would do regardless of my move).\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

I have the Y advantage.\n*   If I move LEFT to (3, 2), I am one square diagonally (UP-RIGHT) from (3, 1).\n\nLet's compare DOWN (4, 1) vs LEFT (3, 2) in relation to (3, 1):\n\n*   (4, 1) -> (3, 1) (2 moves total to apple: 1 current + 1 next turn)\n*   (3, 2) -> (3, 1) (2 moves total to apple: 1 current + 1 next turn)\n\nBoth moves set me up to eat the apple next turn if I move correctly.\n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (4, 1):\n*   Keeps me close to the enemy territory (Y=0, Y=1).\n*   If the enemy moves LEFT (4, 0), I am in a direct competition, but I have the positional advantage (Y=1 vs Y=0). I can move LEFT to (3, 1) next turn, eating the apple, while the enemy would need to move UP to (4, 1) (which would self-kill if I stayed there) or LEFT again to (3, 0) and then UP. Since the enemy cannot move UP to (3, 1) if I am there, and they can't move UP from (4, 0) to (4, 1) if I am there, moving DOWN to (4, 1) seems like a strong play to secure the apple (3, 1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2):\n*   This is safer, keeping me further from the enemy's path if they move LEFT.\n*   If the enemy moves LEFT (4, 0), my path is (3, 2) -> (3, 1) [Apple]. Safe.\n*   If the enemy moves RIGHT (6, 0), my path is (3, 2) -> (3, 1) [Apple]. Safe.\n\nThe move LEFT (3, 2) guarantees I get the apple (3, 1) on turn 7, assuming no catastrophic movement by the enemy that cuts me off from the side (unlikely given their position).\n\nIf I move DOWN (4, 1), and Enemy moves LEFT (4, 0):\n*   Turn 6: Me (4, 1), Enemy (4, 0).\n*   Turn 7: I move LEFT to (3, 1) (Eat apple). Enemy could move UP to (4, 1) (Hitting my former body segment (4, 1) or my new body head (4, 1) if I stayed there - but I'm moving away). If I move LEFT, the enemy can only move LEFT to (3, 0) or UP to (4, 1). If they move UP to (4, 1), they prevent me from moving back to (4, 1) if I needed to, but they don't block the apple.\n\nThe move LEFT (3, 2) seems slightly more robust as it minimizes potential gridlock or accidental collision with the enemy's body path in the Y=1 lane, while still guaranteeing the apple on the following turn. Both moves lead to the apple next turn. Let's prioritize safety and control.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 2):\n1. Sets up (3, 1) for turn 7.\n2. Keeps distance from the enemy's highly constrained movements along Y=0.\n3. Leaves (4, 3) open if a tactical retreat is needed, and keeps the whole upper board available.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT to (3, 2). I will eat the apple at (3, 1) on Turn 7.\n\nLEFT",

It is heavily constrained by the board boundary (Y=0). The body starts at (5, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 1):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, -1):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 0):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 0):** Hitting own body segment (5, 0). **DEAD**.\n\n**Enemy's Safe Moves:** UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0).\n\n**Conflict Check for (3, 1) [Apple]:**\n*   My chosen move is DOWN to (3, 1).\n*   Can the enemy reach (3, 1)?\n    *   From (4, 0), the enemy needs to move UP to (4, 1) and then LEFT to (3, 1). This requires two moves. (3, 1) is unattainable for the enemy this turn.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nMy primary goal is to eat the apple at (3, 1). Moving DOWN achieves this safely.\n\n*   Move: DOWN to (3, 1). I will grow to length 4, and my score will increase to 3.\n\n*   What happens to the enemy?\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (4, 1), they secure the space adjacent to the apple location, but safely away from me.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 0), they are getting closer to the bottom edge and perhaps trying to wall me off, but this leaves (4, 1) open for my future moves.\n\nSince the apple is guaranteed and safe, I execute the DOWN move.\n\n**Future Planning (Post-Apple):**\nAfter eating the apple, my head will be at (3, 1). My body will be [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)]. The board state will be centered around the bottom left. The next nearest apples are (0, 5) and (2, 6). The enemy is currently bottled up near the bottom center. Once I collect this apple, I should likely aim to move UP the left side of the board towards (0, 5) or (2, 6), gaining board control while the enemy is still recovering its position from the bottom constraint.\n\nDOWN",

I need to secure the next reachable apples (0, 5) or (2, 6) and gain control of the board.

(This is the segment I just moved *from*, and since I ate an apple, the tail did not move, making the old head position now a body segment).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** This is the current location of Enemy Head (0). **Head-on collision possibility**. Risky, but if the enemy moves away, I get a clear path.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** Safe. Opens the board to the left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Opens the board to the right, adjacent to the enemy tail block.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:**\n*   UP (3, 2): Self-collision.\n\n**Enemy Analysis from H(3, 0):**\n\nEnemy is at (3, 0). Length 4. Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1)].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** This is my current head position (1). **Head-on collision! Both die.** (Wait, the enemy moves simultaneously. If I move away, the enemy moves into (3, 1). If I stay, we collide).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, -1):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** Safe. Moves toward the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Hits own body segment (4, 0). **DEAD**.\n\n**Enemy's Safe Moves:** UP (3, 1), LEFT (2, 0).\n\n**Conflict and Safety Assessment:**\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (3, 0):**\n    *   Enemy is currently at (3, 0). This is a collision square.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 1), the square (3, 0) is free for me. (But if Enemy moves UP to (3, 1), we collide at (3, 1) anyway, see below.)\n    *   Wait, the enemy is currently AT (3, 0). If I move DOWN, I move into the space (3, 0). Since the enemy is moving, the enemy's head will vacate (3, 0).\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 0): I move DOWN to (3, 0). **Safe for both.** I take the enemy's previous position. This is strategically defensive, pinning the enemy to the bottom wall.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 1): **Head-on collision at (3, 1). DEAD.** (Wait, if the enemy moves UP to (3, 1), and I move DOWN to (3, 0), we do not collide.)\n    *   *Correction on collision mechanics:* We move simultaneously. I start at (3, 1). Enemy starts at (3, 0).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (3, 0), and Enemy moves UP to (3, 1). **We swap places. Safe.**\n\n*   **My move LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 1): Enemy takes my old spot. Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 0): Safe. We are separating.\n\n*   **My move RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 1): Enemy takes my old spot. Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 0): Safe. We are separating.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** This is highly restrictive for the enemy. If Enemy moves LEFT (2, 0), I pin them further into the corner (0,0)-(3,0) area. If Enemy moves UP (3, 1), it allows the enemy to escape but also potentially opens up the route to the right for me later. This move secures the bottom path and potentially sets up a trap. However, it keeps me near the enemy where things are tight.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** This is a clean break towards the open board and apples (0, 5) and (2, 6). If the enemy moves LEFT (2, 0), we maintain parallel paths and contest the left side. If the enemy moves UP (3, 1), I gain a free turn and board space. This is generally the safest and most proactive direction towards board control and scoring.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** This also opens the board but brings me closer to the enemy's body mass [(4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)]. While (4, 1) is currently safe, the enemy could use their body mass to restrict my upward movement.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 1) seems optimal. It avoids any risk of collision (the enemy cannot reach (2, 1) this turn, and I do not target an enemy starting position unless I know they are vacating it) and drives toward the largest open space and the nearest apples.\n\nTarget Apple: (2, 6) is 5 moves away via (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6), though I must be careful of my own body (3, 2).\n\nLet's confirm the path after LEFT:\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 1).\nMy head: (2, 1). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)].\n\nNext turn (Turn 9) from (2, 1):\n*   UP to (2, 2) - Safe.\n*   DOWN to (2, 0) - Potentially blocked by Enemy (if Enemy chose LEFT this turn).\n*   LEFT to (1, 1) - Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1) - Hits my body (3, 1). DEAD.\n\nIf the enemy moved LEFT to (2, 0), I can still safely move UP or LEFT, maintaining good options. This confirms LEFT is the best strategy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT (2, 1), then aim UP along X=2 or X=1 towards apple (2, 6) or (0, 5) respectively. Prioritize gaining altitude and separating myself from the congested bottom strip before the enemy can recover and use their body length to trap me.\n\nLEFT",

UP (2, 2) seems slightly better as it maintains vertical separation from the enemy, who is currently pinned to the bottom row, and continues the push toward the center-left side apples (2, 6) and (5, 4). The apple (2, 6) is a direct path.\n\nLet's stick with the plan to gain altitude and control the center board. Moving UP also opens up movement to the right past my body segments (3, 1), (3, 2) in the subsequent turn, as my body shifts.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2):\nMy new head: (2, 2). Body segments: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2). (4, 2) becomes the tail segment unless I eat.\nI am one step closer to (2, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 1):\nMy new head: (1, 1). Body segments: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2).\nI am two steps closer to (0, 5).\n\nSince (2, 6) is slightly more centrally located and allows for easier continued movement upward and rightward, I will choose UP.\n\nUP",

I have gained a height advantage.\n\n**1. My Possible Moves from (2, 2):**\n\n*   **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. No body/wall collision. Moves toward apple (2, 6).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 1):** Hits my own body segment (2, 1). **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 2):** Safe. No body/wall collision.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Hits my own body segment (3, 2). **DEAD.**\n\n**My Safe Moves:** UP (2, 3), LEFT (1, 2).\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis from (1, 0):**\n\nEnemy Head: (1, 0). Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)].\n\n*   **UP to (1, 1):** Safe. Moves away from wall.\n*   **DOWN to (1, -1):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (0, 0):** Safe. Moves toward apple (0, 5).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 0):** Hits own body segment (2, 0). **DEAD.**\n\n**Enemy Safe Moves:** UP (1, 1), LEFT (0, 0).\n\n**3. Conflict and Strategy Assessment:**\n\nI need to choose between UP (2, 3) and LEFT (1, 2).\n\n*   **Targeting (2, 6):** UP (2, 3) is a direct path.\n*   **Targeting (0, 5):** LEFT (1, 2) moves closer to the left edge; if the enemy moves LEFT (0, 0), we could potentially compete for (0, 5).\n\n*   **Scenario A: I move UP (2, 3).**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP (1, 1) or LEFT (0, 0): We are separating. Good. I gain control of the central vertical path.\n    *   This is the safest move that maintains my advantageous vertical position and directs me toward the nearest apple in open space.\n\n*   **Scenario B: I move LEFT (1, 2).**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP (1, 1): We are close, but separated by a cell. Enemy is now below me.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT (0, 0): We are approaching a potential conflict zone near the (0, 5) apple. The enemy will be at (0, 0) and I will be at (1, 2).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP (2, 3) is the best choice. It maximizes distance separation from the enemy, who is stuck on the bottom wall, and continues my approach toward apple (2, 6). If I move UP, my body will shift, making subsequent moves easier (e.g., RIGHT to (3, 3) next turn will be safe).\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 11):** After moving to (2, 3), I will likely continue UP to (2, 4) or RIGHT to (3, 3) depending on enemy movement and proximity to (2, 6) or (5, 4). Continuing UP seems most direct for (2, 6).\n\nUP",

It also takes me one step *away* from (2, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (3, 3):\n*   This delays reaching (2, 6) but keeps me in the center.\n\nThe absolute best move is to continue maximizing my vertical separation and momentum towards the apple (2, 6). The enemy is currently unable to maneuver aggressively.\n\nI will move UP to (2, 4). This position keeps my body compactly vertical, maintains a high degree of maneuverability (I will have safe moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn), and sets me up for the apple at (2, 6).\n\n**Long-term strategy:** Secure (2, 6). Then assess if I can cut across the top half of the board before Snake 0 reaches the high apples on the left side (like 0, 5).\n\nUP",

Collision Check (Crucial for multi-snake movement):**\n\n*   My intended move: (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\n*   Enemy potential moves: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) or (1, 1).\n\nNo paths intersect. No head-on collision risk. No moving into the future enemy body (since enemy length is 4, their tail will be at (2, 0) or (1, 0) or (0, 0) depending on their move). If the enemy moves UP, their new body is (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0). If they move RIGHT, their new body is (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0). My move (2, 5) is utterly safe from the enemy's body.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to secure the imminent apple at (2, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Eat (2, 6) next turn (Turn 13).\n2. After eating (2, 6), I will be at (2, 6). I will then aim for the apples (6, 7) or (5, 9).\n3. Monitor Snake 0, which is currently climbing vertically towards (0, 5).

I will grow to length 5.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (Post-apple):**\nAfter eating (2, 6), I will be at (2, 6) with a length of 5. The next closest apples are (6, 7) and (5, 4).

It is highly likely the enemy will take it this turn by moving UP to (0, 4) or next turn if they move toward (0, 4) and then (0, 5). If they move right to (1, 3), they might challenge (1, 0) or move towards the center/right.\n\nMy current position (2, 6) gives me good connectivity to the center and right side.\n\n**1.

Moves toward (6, 7) and (5, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 5):** Hits my own body segment. **DEAD.** (Backwards movement)\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):** Safe. Moves slightly closer to the enemy/left wall.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Safe. Best line toward (6, 7).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (2, 7), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy's Possible Moves from (0, 3):**\n\nEnemy Head (0, 3). Body: [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]. Tail is (0, 0). (Note: The board state shows (0, 0) and (1, 0) are both 'T'/'0' body segments but the enemy body list is [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]. I must look at the provided text body list which is [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]. The board visualization I created based on the textual body list differs from the text-generated visualization in the input, which shows (1, 0) as 'T'. I must *only* trust the explicit enemy body list: (0, 2) connected to (0, 1) connected to (0, 0). This means the space (1, 0) is actually an apple, A (1, 0), and *not* a body segment, and the space (1, 1) is free. I will use the *textual board* representation from the input for collisions, but rely on the *explicit coordinate lists* for snake placement for movement decisions.)\n\n**Recalculated Enemy Blocked Cells (Enemy length 4):** (0, 3) Head. Body: (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0).\n*   **UP to (0, 4):** Safe. Moves directly toward (0, 5).\n*   **DOWN to (0, 2):** Hits own body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 3):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Safe. Challenges the center.\n\nEnemy Safe Moves: UP (0, 4), RIGHT (1, 3).\n\n**3. Evaluate My Safe Moves:**\n\nI cannot get to (0, 5) before the enemy does, assuming they pursue it. I should focus on (5, 4) or (6, 7). (5, 4) seems slightly closer in Manhattan distance (2, 6) to (5, 4) is 3+2=5. (2, 6) to (6, 7) is 4+1=5. Similar distance. (5, 4) is lower, keeping me away from the enemy if they go high. (6, 7) keeps me higher.\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (3, 6).**\n    *   Path towards (6, 7): (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (4 moves).\n    *   Path towards (5, 4): (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) or (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 4) (4 moves).\n    *   This move takes me immediately away from the enemy's potential moves (0, 4) and (1, 3).\n    *   If Enemy moves (1, 3): Their head is far from mine. Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves (0, 4): Their head is far from mine. Safe.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP to (2, 7).**\n    *   Path towards (6, 7): (2, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (6, 7) (4 moves).\n    *   This is safe and maintains a central column position.\n\n*   **Option C: Move LEFT to (1, 6).**\n    *   This moves toward the enemy's path and should be avoided unless necessary. If the enemy moves right to (1, 3), I am only 3 spaces away, increasing collision risk if I continue left/down.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth RIGHT (3, 6) and UP (2, 7) are excellent options. RIGHT gets me slightly closer to the right side of the board and provides the most lateral space away from the immediate enemy action on the left wall. I will target (6, 7) or (5, 4). Moving RIGHT is a strong commitment to the right half of the board.\n\nLet's check for any simultaneous head-on collision risk with RIGHT (3, 6).\nEnemy potential moves: (0, 4) or (1, 3).\nNeither of these is (3, 6). Collision risk is zero.\n\nLet's look ahead one more step.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 6).\nIf Enemy moves UP to (0, 4) (likely for 0, 5).\nNext turn (T15), I will be at (3, 6).\nMy safe moves: R (4, 6), U (3, 7), L (2, 6 - now my body T), D (3, 5).\nR (4, 6) continues moving towards (6, 7). U (3, 7) also moves toward (6, 7).\n\nI choose RIGHT to maximize lateral clearance from the enemy and start my move toward the apple cluster on the right/top.\n\nRIGHT",

They will almost certainly take it this turn by moving UP.\n\nMy goal is to reach one of the apples on the right side: (6, 7), (5, 4), or (5, 9).\n\nFrom (3, 6), I am aiming for the right half of the board.\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (3, 6):**\n\n*   **UP to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (6, 7).\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 4).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):** Hits my own body segment. **DEAD.** (Backwards movement)\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe. Moves efficiently toward (5, 4) or (6, 7).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), RIGHT (4, 6).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy's Possible Moves from (0, 4):**\n\nEnemy is length 4. Body occupies (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1). Tail is (0, 1).\n*   **UP to (0, 5):** Takes the apple (0, 5). Highly likely. Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 3):** Hits own body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 4):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Safe. Keeps pressure on the central column.\n\nIf the enemy is focusing on apples, they will move UP to (0, 5).\n\n**3. Evaluate My Safe Moves:**\n\nI need to make progress toward the right-side apples while maintaining safety. The enemies movements are restricted to the left side, so collision risk is minimal regardless of my choice, as long as I do not go left.\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (4, 6).**\n    *   Leads directly toward (5, 4) (1 step right, 2 steps down) or (6, 7) (2 steps right, 1 step up).\n    *   This is the fastest lateral move to escape the \"2\" column where my entire body currently lies.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP to (3, 7).**\n    *   Leads toward (6, 7) (3 steps right, 0 steps up).\n    *   Also good, keeps me high.\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (3, 5).**\n    *   Leads toward (5, 4) (2 steps right, 1 step down).\n    *   This is a good positioning move for (5, 4).\n\n**Comparing goals:**\n(6, 7) is 3 steps away via (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (4 steps total, or 3 if (6, 7) is chosen next). Wait, (3, 6) to (6, 7) is 3 horizontal, 1 vertical. Manhattan distance 4.\n(5, 4) is 2 steps right, 2 steps down. Manhattan distance 4.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 6):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (5, 6) (1 step from (5, 4) or (6, 7)), or DOWN to (4, 5). This keeps options open.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (4, 5) or (3, 4). (4, 5) leads to (5, 4) in 2 steps.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 7):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (4, 7). (4, 7) leads to (6, 7) in 2 steps.\n\nMoving RIGHT (4, 6) seems the most flexible and quickly clears my body segments on the left. It provides excellent central access to both targets.\n\nLet's confirm no tricky collision if the enemy decides to move RIGHT to (1, 4).\nMy trajectory: (3, 6) -> (4, 6).\nEnemy trajectory: (0, 4) -> (1, 4).\nThey are 3 units apart now. No conflict.\n\nI will continue moving right to gain open space and pursue the right-side apples.\n\nRIGHT",

I did not eat an apple on Turn 15, as my score is still 4.\nTherefore, my tail at T=15 (2, 3) disappeared.\nMy Body (T=16 start): (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4). My Tail is (2, 4). (This confirms the input list).\n\nEnemy's Turn 15 move (presumably UP to (0, 5), eating the apple at (0, 5) from T=15 state).\nIf Enemy ate an apple, their score would be 5 and their length would be 6. But their score is 4 and their length is 5.\nThis means the enemy DID NOT GATHER AN APPLE at (0, 5) on the last turn, OR the apple (0, 5) from the previous turn was removed because they moved up to it.\n\nLet's look at the apple list for T=15: (0, 5), (6, 7), (5, 9), (5, 4), (1, 0).\nCurrent Apple List (T=16): (6, 7), (5, 9), (5, 4), (1, 0), (6, 3).\nThe apple at (0, 5) is gone. A new apple appeared at (6, 3).\nSince the enemy's score is 4, they must have moved *away* from (0, 5) or missed it entirely, OR the state reflects an update where the apple was removed but the score hasn't updated yet. Given the tie score of 4-4 and the length 5, it is most likely that the enemy moved to (0, 5) but the apple at that spot was *not* the one intended for the next growth, or the enemy had not collected it yet.\n\nWait, the current enemy head is at (0, 5). This means they just arrived there (presumably UP from (0, 4) in the previous turn). If (0, 5) was an apple, they should have eaten it. Since their score didn't increase, either they chose a different move, or the apple system is flawed, or the current state provided reflects an intermediate step.\n\nCrucial assumption: The current head position (0, 5) *was* an empty space/apple space when they moved there. Since (0, 5) is not in the current apple list, we must assume they successfully claimed it, but if their score didn't update, it suggests the score update happens *after* the turn completion and before the next move computation, but only if they truly grew.\n\nLet's trust the provided state: Head 0 at (0, 5), Score 4, Length 5.\nIf they moved to (0, 5) and it was an apple, their length should be 6. If they didn't grow, then (0, 5) was not an apple they ate.\nHowever, the apple (0, 5) from T=15 is now gone from the apple list.\n\nConclusion: The enemy moved UP to (0, 5). Since they are Length 5, they did *not* grow (meaning (0, 5) was either not an apple or their score update is lagging/bugged). For move purpose, I assume (0, 5) is now occupied by Head 0.\n\n**My Goal:** Continue moving right to secure apples (6, 7), (5, 9), (5, 4), or (6, 3). I am at (4, 6).\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (4, 6):**\n*   **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (6, 7).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 4).\n*   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Hits my own body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3). Very efficient.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (4, 7), DOWN (4, 5), RIGHT (5, 6).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy's Possible Moves from (0, 5):**\nEnemy Tail is (0, 1). The space (0, 1) will be free next turn if they don't eat.\n*   **UP to (0, 6):** Safe. Explores the upper wall area.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 4):** Safe. Moves onto their previous body segment, which clears.\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 5):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 5):** Safe. Moves into the center.\n\nThe enemy snake is relatively isolated on the left boundary. They are not an immediate threat to me at (4, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate My Safe Moves (Targeting right side apples):**\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (5, 6) (1 step towards apples):**\n    *   This is the fastest way to get into the zone of 4 apples (5, 9), (6, 7), (5, 4), (6, 3).\n    *   From (5, 6):\n        *   (5, 9) is 3 steps UP.\n        *   (6, 7) is 1 step RIGHT, 1 step UP.\n        *   (5, 4) is 2 steps DOWN.\n        *   (6, 3) is 1 step RIGHT, 3 steps DOWN.\n    *   This move takes me onto X=5, which is highly advantageous.\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   Leads directly toward (6, 7). From (4, 7), (6, 7) is 2 steps RIGHT.\n    *   Puts me far from (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   Leads directly toward (5, 4). From (4, 5), (5, 4) is 1 step RIGHT, 1 step DOWN (if I miss (5, 4), I can go to (4, 4) then (5, 4) or (5, 5) then (5, 4)). Let's check (5, 4).\n    *   From (4, 5), I can move RIGHT to (5, 5). Then DOWN to (5, 4) (apple). (2 steps).\n\nComparing (5, 6) and (4, 5) for (5, 4):\nFrom (4, 6):\nRIGHT to (5, 6). Next turn DOWN to (5, 5). Next turn DOWN to (5, 4) (3 steps total).\nDOWN to (4, 5). Next turn RIGHT to (5, 5). Next turn DOWN to (5, 4) (3 steps total).\n\nComparing (5, 6) and (4, 7) for (6, 7):\nFrom (4, 6):\nRIGHT to (5, 6). Next turn UP to (5, 7). Next turn RIGHT to (6, 7) (3 steps total).\nUP to (4, 7). Next turn RIGHT to (5, 7). Next turn RIGHT to (6, 7) (3 steps total).\n\nAll three safe moves reach the nearest apples in 3 steps, but the move RIGHT to (5, 6) provides the most central position relative to all four accessible apples on the right half. It also pushes my body further away from the confining wall on X=0/1/2.\n\nI choose RIGHT to maximize positional flexibility. (5, 6) is an empty, safe spot.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure apples on X=5, 6. If the enemy moves right aggressively (unlikely, as they are boxed in near X=0), I need to be aware of collision risk, but for now, they are far. After reaching (5, 6), I will evaluate whether to go for (6, 7) or (5, 4)/(6, 3). (6, 7) is slightly closer than (5, 4) via orthogonal distance if I go UP first.\n\nMoving RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

The closest apple orthogonally is (6, 7) or (5, 4).\n\n*   (6, 7): Distance 2 (1 Right, 1 Up)\n*   (5, 4): Distance 2 (2 Down)\n*   (6, 3): Distance 3 (1 Right, 3 Down)\n*   (5, 9): Distance 3 (3 Up)\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (5, 6):**\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves towards (6, 7) and (5, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Moves towards (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Hits my own body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves towards (6, 7) and (6, 3).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), RIGHT (6, 6).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy's Possible Moves from (1, 5):**\nEnemy is moving right, attempting to cross the board. They are currently confined by the X=0 wall and their own body on X=0. Now at (1, 5), they have more options.\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe (moves onto previous body segment).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** DANGER! (2, 5) is my tail. If I don't eat, my tail moves, freeing (2, 5). If I move to (5, 7), for example, my tail (2, 5) moves, and the space (2, 5) becomes empty. If the enemy moves there, it is safe.\n\nThe enemy is far away (Manhattan distance 4/5) and is not restricting my moves.\n\n**3. Evaluate My Safe Moves (Targeting closest apples):**\n\nI want to prioritize the nearest apples: (6, 7) and (5, 4).\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (5, 7).**\n    *   Next turn, I can reach (6, 7) with a RIGHT move. (2 steps total for an apple).\n    *   This also sets me up for (5, 9).\n    *   If I go UP, I isolate myself from (5, 4).\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (5, 5).**\n    *   Next turn, I can reach (5, 4) with a DOWN move (apple). (2 steps total for an apple).\n    *   Set up for (6, 3) (2 more steps).\n\n*   **Option C: Move RIGHT to (6, 6).**\n    *   Next turn, I can reach (6, 7) with an UP move (apple). (2 steps total for an apple).\n    *   Next turn, I can reach (6, 3) with 3 steps DOWN.\n\nAll three moves lead to an apple in 2 turns. This means I should choose the move that keeps me most flexible or puts me in the best quadrant for future apples.\n\n(5, 7) leads toward the top-right block (6, 7) and (5, 9).\n(5, 5) leads toward the bottom-right block (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n\nSince both (6, 7) and (5, 4) are 2 steps away, let's look at the density beyond them.\nTop-right: (6, 7) and (5, 9)\nBottom-right: (5, 4) and (6, 3)\n\nThe density is equal (2 apples in each immediate cluster). Choosing UP or DOWN is a tactical choice focusing on one cluster.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6):\nI am 1 step from (6, 7) (UP) and 3 steps from (6, 3) (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\nThis position (6, 6) is slightly more committed to the X=6 column, but it maintains the 2-step lead on (6, 7).\n\nLet's pick UP to (5, 7).\n1. Move UP to (5, 7).\n2. Move RIGHT to (6, 7) (Apple!). (Turn 18)\n3. Move UP to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 8). If (5, 9) is the goal, move UP.\n\nThis sequence is efficient and gives me a 2-step apple grab, putting me ahead of the enemy, who is still far from apples. The apple at (1, 0) is very far for both of us right now.\n\nI choose UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. T=17: UP to (5, 7).\n2. T=18: RIGHT to (6, 7) (Eat Apple 1).\n3. T=19: Evaluate moving toward (5, 9) or dropping down for (5, 4)/(6, 3), depending on enemy position/movement.\n\nUP",

(5, 9) seems slightly safer as it moves me away from the enemy.\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (6, 7):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 9) and (3, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves along the edge, toward (6, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 7):** Hits my own body segment. **DEAD.** (This was where my head was last turn).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe. Moves further away from the current body core.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 8):** Path to (5, 9) is open (e.g., UP, LEFT, UP). This keeps me high up and away from the enemy concentrated near y=4.\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 6):** This moves me closer to my body segments (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6) but doesn't immediately intersect them. It moves towards (5, 4) and (6, 3).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe but doesn't move towards any nearby apple. Good for spacing and safety if needed, but not optimal for scoring.\n\nComparing UP and DOWN:\nMoving UP (6, 8) sets me up perfectly for the (5, 9) apple.\nMoving DOWN (6, 6) sets me up for (6, 3) or (5, 4).\n\nLet's check the proximity to the enemy. Enemy is at (2, 4). The enemy is currently focused on the left-center/bottom area. They might go for (5, 4) or (1, 0).\n\nIf I go UP, I head to (6, 8). Next moves to (5, 9) would be (6, 9) (UP) then (5, 9) (LEFT), or (5, 8) (LEFT) then towards (5, 9).\n\nIf I go DOWN, I head to (6, 6). Next steps towards (5, 4) or (6, 3).\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction from (2, 4):**\nThe enemy is likely aiming for (5, 4) or (1, 0).\n*   **UP to (2, 5):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 0) or (6, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 4):** Hits own body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 4).\n\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (3, 4) they are aiming for (5, 4).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (2, 3) they are aiming for (1, 0) or (6, 3).\n\nI should prioritize getting to (5, 9) as it is in a space where the enemy is unlikely to go immediately, and it is relatively safe.\n\nIf I choose UP:\n(6, 7) -> (6, 8). I am safe.\n\nThe path to (5, 9):\n1. T=19: UP to (6, 8).\n2. T=20: LEFT to (5, 8) or UP to (6, 9). (6, 9) is safer as (5, 8) would be one move away from (5, 7) which is my former head position, if I don't follow up with a move away from it. Let's aim through (6, 9).\n3. T=21: LEFT to (5, 9) (EAT).\n\nThis seems like a solid, three-turn plan to another apple, keeping me in the secure upper half of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nPrioritize apples in the upper half of the board ((5, 9), (3, 9)) as the enemy is currently operating low and left (near (2, 4)). Moving UP to (6, 8) sets up a safe capture of (5, 9).\n\nUP",

My prediction last turn was that the enemy would go RIGHT to (3, 4) to aim for (5, 4). This seems to have happened. Enemy body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. Length: 5. Note: The tail of Snake 0 would have moved from (0, 5) to (0, 4) if it did not eat an apple (which it did not). Wait, the provided board state shows Enemy Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. This means the enemy's tail is currently (0, 5) *before* the move, and the head is (3, 4). This implies the enemy ate an apple last turn T=19 at (3, 4) or (2, 4) or length calculation is off.\n    Let's reconstruct Snake 0's move T=19.\n    *   T=18 Head: (2, 4).

No apples were at (3, 4) or (2, 4) in the T=18 state provided in the previous rationale (apples were (5, 9), (5, 4), (1, 0), (6, 3), (3, 9)).\n    *   If no apple was eaten, the new body should be: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. The old tail (0, 4) vanishes.\n    *   The provided current state for Snake #0 is: Head: (3, 4), Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. This is consistent with a non-eating move from (2, 4) to (3, 4). Length 5.\n*   **Apples (A):** (5, 9), (5, 4), (1, 0), (6, 3), (3, 9).\n\n**Board Visualization (T=20):**\n 9 . . . A .

Analyze My Possible Moves from (6, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves directly toward (5, 9) and (3, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (6, 7):** Hits my own body segment (the neck). **DEAD.** (The neck is (6, 7)).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe. Moves directly toward (5, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe. Neutral move, maintains position.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (5, 9):**\n\nThe shortest path to (5, 9) is 2 moves away.\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 8).\n2. Move UP to (5, 9) (Eat).\n\nAlternative path:\n1. Move UP to (6, 9).\n2. Move LEFT to (5, 9) (Eat).\n\nBoth paths achieve the apple in 2 moves and are safe. Left (5, 8) looks slightly more direct.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 8):** (5, 8) is safe. Next turn, I will be at (5, 8) and can move UP to (5, 9) to eat. This is efficient.\n*   **Move UP to (6, 9):** (6, 9) is safe. Next turn, I can move LEFT to (5, 9) to eat. Also efficient.\n\nComparing LEFT vs UP:\nMoving LEFT puts me closer to the center column (x=5) where the apple is located. Moving UP puts me on the top edge (y=9), potentially limiting options slightly if I wanted to move right later, but since the apple is at (5, 9), it doesn't matter much. Both are excellent options. I'll choose LEFT for the most direct approach.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Prediction (Head at (3, 4)):**\nThe enemy is likely targeting (5, 4).\nPossible Enemy moves:\n*   UP to (3, 5): Safe. Good for (5, 9) or (3, 9), but distance is long.\n*   DOWN to (3, 3): Safe. Good for (6, 3).\n*   LEFT to (2, 4): Hits neck/body segment (2, 4). **DEAD.**\n*   RIGHT to (4, 4): Safe. Sets up for (5, 4) next turn. (4, 4) is 1 move from (5, 4).\n\nThe most logical move for the enemy is RIGHT to (4, 4) to grab (5, 4) next turn. The distance to (5, 4) is 2 moves: (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4).\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 4), they will be focused on the bottom half of the board. This confirms my choice to secure (5, 9) in the top half.\n\n**4. Final Move Selection:**\nMoving LEFT to (5, 8) is the most direct path to the apple at (5, 9), keeps me safely away from the enemy, and ensures I capture the apple in T=21.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 8).\n2. Move UP to (5, 9) to eat the apple.\n3. After eating at (5, 9), assess if enemy has taken (5, 4). If not, potentially move down the periphery to grab (3, 9) or (5, 4). If the enemy is successful, target (3, 9).\n\nLEFT",

This is clearly the superior move.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 8):** Safe, but misses the apple.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Prediction (Head at (3, 3)):**\nThe enemy is centered on the lower half. They are close to (6, 3) (3 moves away) and (1, 0) (3 moves away). They are also 4 moves from (5, 4).\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (3, 3):\n*   UP to (3, 4): Hits body segment (3, 4). **DEAD.**\n*   DOWN to (3, 2): Safe.

Good move towards (6, 3).\n\nThe enemy's top priority should be (6, 3) or (1, 0).\nIf they move RIGHT to (4, 3), they set up for (6, 3) (2 moves away).\nIf they move DOWN to (3, 2) or LEFT to (2, 3), they set up for (1, 0) (approx 3 moves away).\n\nRegardless of the enemy's move, my capture of (5, 9) is safe as they are far away and focused elsewhere.\n\n**4. Final Move Selection:**\nMove UP to capture the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\n1. Move UP to (5, 9) and collect the apple.\n2. Next turn (T=22), my head will be at (5, 9). I will have four options:\n    *   DOWN: Safe (if I expanded, (5, 8) will be my neck).\n    *   LEFT to (4, 9): Safe, moves towards (3, 9).\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 9): Safe, perimeter control.\n    *   UP: Off board. DEAD.\n3. The next targets are (3, 9) (2 moves away) and (5, 4) (5 moves away).\n4. The enemy is currently focused low.

Analyze My Possible Moves from (5, 9):**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 10):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN to (5, 8):** Hits my neck segment (5, 8). **DEAD** (Directly backwards move). *Wait, technically this is not a guaranteed death under some strict rules, but in competitive Snake implementations, moving into the cell previously occupied by your head and now occupied by your neck is usually fatal unless you grew.* I just grew, so the tail (4, 6) is still the tail, and the body segment (5, 8) will become empty **if I didn't grow**. Since I ate an apple (grew), (5, 8) is still part of my body. It is the segment immediately behind the head. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 9):** Safe. Moves toward apple at (3, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves along the perimeter.\n\nSafe Moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (4, 9):** Places me 1 step away from (3, 9). This is the best strategic option.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Places me in an empty corner. No immediate benefit.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Prediction (Head at (4, 3)):**\nThe enemy is in the central lower area.\nThey are adjacent to the apple at (5, 4). They are 2 steps from (6, 3).\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (4, 3):\n*   UP to (4, 4): Safe. Moves closer to (5, 4) (1 step away on the next turn).\n*   DOWN to (4, 2): Safe. Good pivot.\n*   LEFT to (3, 3): Hits body segment (3, 3). **DEAD.**\n*   RIGHT to (5, 3): Safe. Moves closer to (6, 3) (2 steps away). Also positions for (5, 4) (1 step away on the next turn).\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 3) or UP to (4, 4), they are prioritizing the apples (5, 4) and (6, 3).\nIf they move to (5, 3), they are poised to eat (5, 4) on T=23 or (6, 3) on T=24.\nIf they move to (4, 4), they are poised to eat (5, 4) on T=23.\n\nI am far away from this action and secured my high-value apple. I must secure (3, 9) now.\n\n**4. Check for Collisions:**\nMoving LEFT to (4, 9). The enemy is currently at (4, 3). No collision risk.\n\n**5. Final Move Selection:**\nMove LEFT to progress toward the apple at (3, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 9) (T=22).\n2. Move LEFT again to (3, 9) (T=23) to capture the apple.\n3. After capturing (3, 9), I will be at (3, 9) length 8. I will have a significant score lead (8-4 or better).\n4. Depending on enemy movement, the next target will likely be (9, 5) or sweeping down the right side (where (6, 3) and (5, 4) are located, contested by the enemy).\n\nLEFT",

The nearest apples are (9, 5) (9 steps), (6, 3) (9 steps), (3, 2) (7 steps), (0, 2) (10 steps), (1, 0) (11 steps).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 8):** This moves me down the side, maintaining control of the left half. It leads directly towards apple (3, 2) (4 steps away). This is a good strategic move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 9):** This moves me further into the corner. While safe, it puts me in a slight bottleneck if I need to change direction quickly, and it doesn't immediately approach the next closest apple (3, 2).\n\nThe best general direction is South (DOWN) towards the center of the board, which brings (3, 2) into primary range.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Check (Snake 0 at 5, 4, Length 6):**\n\nThe enemy is focused on the central part of the board. The nearest apples to the enemy are (6, 3), and possibly (9, 5).\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (5, 4):\n*   To (5, 5) (UP): Safe.\n*   To (5, 3) (DOWN): Hits body segment (5, 3) (neck). **DEAD.**\n*   To (6, 4) (RIGHT): Safe.\n*   To (4, 4) (LEFT): Safe.\n\nIf the enemy ate (5, 4) on T=23, they are now likely pushing toward (6, 3) or trying to control the center.\n*   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 4): They are heading towards (6, 3).\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (5, 5): They are heading towards (9, 5) or sweeping horizontally.\n*   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (4, 4): They are trying to consolidate the center and potentially cut off access to (3, 2).\n\nSince the enemy's maximum Y is 5, and my minimum Y is 8 (if I move DOWN), there is zero risk of head-to-head collision or body collision this turn, regardless of my safe move choice. My path is clear to move south.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\nMoving DOWN towards (3, 2) is the most efficient apple-gathering path and allows me to slowly descend the board, utilizing my length advantage to control space.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nMove DOWN toward (3, 2). After securing (3, 2), I will either move LEFT to (0, 2) and (1, 0) to control the bottom left quadrant, or continue moving down the center/left side, depending on enemy movement toward (6, 3) and (9, 5). If the enemy captures (6, 3), I should probably favor the bottom left apples to prevent the enemy from gaining too large a lead, then swing over to (9, 5) later. If the enemy moves toward (9, 5), I should prioritize (6, 3) or the bottom left. Focus is on maintaining the apple lead while maximizing space control for my longer body.\n\nDOWN",

No body segments, not off board.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe. No body segments, not off board.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Safe. No body segments, not off board.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1:**\n\nMy immediate goal is apple (3, 2), which is 3 steps away (down, down, down) or similar path.\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 7):** Moves directly towards (3, 2). This is the shortest path to an apple. It maintains my control on the left side of the enemy mass.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Moves me away from the wall and the apple (3, 2). However, it brings me closer to my internal body segments (5, 8), (6, 8). This could offer better access to the center later, but costs time to get (3, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):** Moves me further left, away from the enemy. Safe, but slightly longer path to (3, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN seems optimal as it directly attacks the closest apple (3, 2) without immediately entering dense body clusters.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Check (Snake 0 at 6, 4, Length 6):**\n\nThe enemy's nearest apples are (6, 3) (1 step away) and (9, 5) (5 steps away). Given the proximity of (6, 3), it is highly likely the enemy will move there.\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (6, 4):\n*   **DOWN to (6, 3):** This is an apple. Highly likely.\n*   **UP to (6, 5):** Safe. Heading toward (9, 5).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe. Also heading toward (9, 5).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 4):** Hits body segment (5, 4) (neck). **DEAD.**\n\n*If Enemy (0) moves to (6, 3) (DOWN):* The new head is (6, 3). The new body will be [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length 7.\n\n*Collision Check (My target (3, 7) vs. Enemy targets):*\nMy head (3, 8) and all my safe targets (3, 7, 2, 8, 4, 8) are far from the enemy head (6, 4) and its targets (6, 3, 6, 5, 7, 4). No head-to-head collision risk. No moving into the enemy's body risk this turn, as my path is currently focused on the upper-left quadrant.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\nThe path to (3, 2) is clear, and the best move is DOWN to (3, 7). This continues the strategy of claiming the bottom-left apples and expanding my territory away from the dense T-shaped body mass I currently have, minimizing self-collision risks.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving DOWN towards (3, 2). Once (3, 2) is secured, assess the enemy's position. If the enemy secured (6, 3) and is moving East, prioritize the bottom-left apples (0, 2) and (1, 0) to maintain the score lead and positional control. If the enemy gets stuck or moves North towards (9, 5), potentially pivot towards (6, 3) if it wasn't taken, or circle back. Focus on maximum growth and keeping the spatial pressure on Snake 0.\n\nDOWN",

Moving towards apple (3, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Goal: Apple (3, 2)):**\n\nThe apple (3, 2) is 5 steps away (down, down, left, up, right?) No, that's wrong. (3, 2) is 5 steps down. Wait, (3, 7) to (3, 2) is 5 steps: (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2).\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** Best path towards the closest apple (3, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves away from the enemy, but slightly away from (3, 2). Opens up territory towards the left wall.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Moves towards the center. Potentially useful for maneuvering around my large body mass (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), etc. But it delays reaching (3, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN seems highly preferred as it is the direct route towards the apple (3, 2) and keeps me constrained to the left side of the board mass, which is safer.\n\nLet's check for future blockages if I go DOWN:\nNext turn: (3, 6). Safe moves: DOWN (to 3, 5), LEFT (to 2, 6), RIGHT (to 4, 6).\nThe path (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) is mostly clear, but I must check if the enemy's tail or body will interfere.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Check (Snake 0 at 6, 3, Length 7):**\n\nThe enemy just ate an apple at (6, 3). Its new immediate target is likely (7, 6) (4 steps away) or (9, 5) (5 steps away). The enemy is currently positioned to move North, East, or South.\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (6, 3):\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Hits neck segment (6, 4). **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Moves toward open space.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 3):** Hits body segment (5, 3). **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Moves efficiently toward (7, 6) or (9, 5).\n\nThe enemy's safe moves are DOWN (6, 2) or RIGHT (7, 3).\n1.  **If Enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 3):** This moves it towards the right side of the map and the apple (7, 6).\n2.  **If Enemy goes DOWN to (6, 2):** This moves it away from nearby apples but into open space, possibly setting up for (9, 5) or (1, 0) later.\n\nGiven the enemy's recent growth, it is crucial they keep moving. (7, 3) seems like the most logical choice to secure (7, 6) or (9, 5). If they go to (7, 3), the head is (7, 3) and the tail segment (3, 4) remains.\n\n**Collision Check (My DOWN move to (3, 6)):**\n*   (3, 6) is far from the enemy head (6, 3) and its likely targets.\n*   The enemy's body is [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)].\n*   My target (3, 6) does not intersect any enemy body segment.\n*   Crucially, when Snake 0 moves, its tail (3, 4) will vacate.\n\n*If Snake 0 moves to (7, 3):* The body becomes [(7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The segment (3, 4) becomes clear/open space.\n\n*If Snake 0 moves to (6, 2):* The body becomes [(6, 2), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. The segment (3, 4) becomes clear/open space.\n\nMy chosen path DOWN to (3, 6) is safe.\n\n**4. Long-term Path Consideration:**\nIf I continue DOWN:\n(3, 7) -> (3, 6) [Safe]\n(3, 6) -> (3, 5) [Safe]\n(3, 5) -> (3, 4) [If enemy moves, (3, 4) is their old tail. Safe.]\n(3, 4) -> (3, 3) [Currently enemy body. If enemy moves, (3, 3) becomes old tail, safe if enemy does not grow]\n(3, 3) -> (3, 2) [Apple]\n\nWait, let's re-examine that path after T+1:\nMy head is (3, 7). Enemy tail is (3, 4). Enemy body is (3, 3).\n\nT=26: Move DOWN to (3, 6).\nT=27: My head is (3, 6). My tail is (3, 8). Enemy moves (say to (7, 3), no growth). Enemy tail is (3, 3). Enemy body remains (4, 3), (5, 3), etc.\nMy move options from (3, 6): DOWN to (3, 5). Safe.\n\nT=28: My head is (3, 5). My tail is (3, 9). Enemy moves (say to (8, 3), no growth). Enemy tail is (4, 3).\nMy move options from (3, 5): DOWN to (3, 4). Safe. (This cell (3, 4) was previously the enemy's body, but should now be open space as they moved and didn't eat).\n\nT=29: My head is (3, 4). My tail is (4, 9). Enemy moves (say to (9, 3), no growth). Enemy tail is (5, 3).\nMy move options from (3, 4): DOWN to (3, 3). **(3, 3) is currently held by the enemy body!** If the enemy does NOT eat and moves, (3, 3) will be the new open tail cell.\nIf the enemy is still moving right/up, they are unlikely to eat. So (3, 3) should be free (as it's the 3rd segment from the end of a 7-segment ungrowing snake).\nEnemy body: (H), (N), (S1), (S2), (S3), (S4), (T). S4 is (4, 3). S3 is (5, 3). S2 is (5, 4). S1 is (6, 4). (N) is (6, 4). (H) is (6, 3). Wait, let's use the provided body list for Snake 0 (Head: (6, 3), Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]).\nT = 26. Length 7.\nIf S0 moves to (7, 3) (no growth): New body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]. Tail (3, 4) is free.\nT = 27 (My head 3, 6).\nIf S0 moves to (8, 3) (no growth): New body: [(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3)]. Tail (3, 3) is free.\nT = 28 (My head 3, 5).\nIf S0 moves to (9, 3) (no growth): New body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. Tail (4, 3) is free.\nT = 29 (My head 3, 4).\nMy target (3, 3) is safe if S0 moved and didn't eat up to this point.\n\nT=30: My head is (3, 3). My tail is (5, 9). Enemy moves.\nMy move options from (3, 3): DOWN to (3, 2). **APPLE!** (Growth +1).\n\nThis path (straight DOWN) seems strategically sound until I hit the apple (3, 2) around turn 30, provided the enemy does not grow too much by crossing in front of me or stealing the apple. The enemy is moving away, so this strategy is good.\n\n**5. Final Decision:** Continue the clear path to the apple at (3, 2).\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving DOWN towards (3, 2). This path appears clear of immediate body collisions as the enemy snake is currently moving horizontally toward the right side of the map and will likely not grow in the immediate future. Once (3, 2) is secured, assess the remaining apples (1, 0) and (0, 2) which are nearby, while maintaining awareness of the increasingly long body shape I have constructed in the upper half of the board.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Goal: Apple (3, 2)):**\n\nI am at (3, 6). The closest apple is (3, 2), 4 steps away straight down.\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5):** Ideal move to continue the path towards (3, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):** Deviates from the primary apple path.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Deviates from the primary apple path and moves near a section of my large body mass (5, 8), (6, 8), potentially restricting future movement.\n\nThe clear priority is to move DOWN towards (3, 2).\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction & Collision Check (Snake 0 at 6, 2):**\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 2). It has immediate access to apples (3, 2) (4 steps west), (7, 6) (5 steps north/east), or (9, 5) (6 steps east/north). Given its current position, it could challenge me for (3, 2), although my path is more direct.\n\nPossible Enemy moves from (6, 2):\n*   **UP to (6, 3):** Hits neck segment (6, 3). **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. This move puts it closer to (3, 2).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe.\n\nIf the Enemy attempts to foil my apple grab at (3, 2), it will move LEFT to (5, 2).\nIf it moves LEFT to (5, 2):\nT=28: Enemy head (5, 2). My head (3, 5).\nEnemy needs 3 more steps (4, 2), (3, 2) (EAT).\nI need 3 more steps (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2) (EAT).\nWe will arrive at (3, 2) on the same turn (T=30). This would result in a head-on collision and both of us dying if the enemy chooses LEFT and I continue DOWN without considering their move.\n\nLet's assume the enemy wants to maximize its chances and will calculate the path to (3, 2).\nPath 1 (Enemy): (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2). (3 moves)\nPath 2 (Mine): (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2). (4 moves)\n\nWAIT! My path length calculation was wrong.\nMy current head is (3, 6).\n(3, 6) -> (3, 5) (Move 1)\n(3, 5) -> (3, 4) (Move 2)\n(3, 4) -> (3, 3) (Move 3)\n(3, 3) -> (3, 2) (Move 4, EAT)\nI arrive at (3, 2) on Turn 31 if I move straight down.\n\nEnemy path: (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2). (3 moves).\nThe enemy arrives at (3, 2) on Turn 30 if they go LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.\n\nThe enemy can win this race by one turn if they move optimally for that apple. I must adjust my strategy.\n\n**Alternative strategy: Block or Pivot?**\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, I should pivot to avoid a collision trap and target another apple.\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 6), I could then go (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4) (Enemy body), (6, 4) (Enemy body). This direction seems constrained.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 6), I can head towards apple (0, 2) (4 steps: (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2)? No, too winding).\n(2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) - too far.\n(2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) - Still wrong.\n\n(2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2)\n(2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2)\nLet's use Manhattan distance for (0, 2): |3-0| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nApples available:\nA1 (3, 2): Enemy 3 steps, Me 4 steps. (Enemy wins race)\nA2 (0, 2): Me 7 steps (via left side).\nA3 (1, 0): Me 7 steps (via left side).\nA4 (7, 6): Me 4 steps ((4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)). Enemy 5 steps (via Right/Up).\nA5 (9, 5): Me 6 steps (via Right/Up). Enemy 6 steps.\n\nSince the enemy can easily take (3, 2), I should pivot to A4 (7, 6). I am only 4 moves away.\n\n**New Target: Apple (7, 6)**\nPath: (3, 6) -> RIGHT (4, 6) -> RIGHT (5, 6) -> RIGHT (6, 6) -> UP (7, 6) [EAT at T=31]\n\nLet's check for head-to-head collision if I go RIGHT (7, 6) and the enemy goes for (7, 6).\nEnemy is at (6, 2).\nPath 1 (Enemy UP/RIGHT): (6, 2) -> (6, 3) [Body segment, not safe], (7, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2)\nEnemy safe path to (7, 6) (5 steps): (6, 2) -> RIGHT (7, 2) -> UP (7, 3) -> UP (7, 4) -> UP (7, 5) -> UP (7, 6) [EAT at T=32]. The enemy requires 5 steps.\n\nMy path to (7, 6) (4 steps): (3, 6) -> RIGHT (4, 6) -> RIGHT (5, 6) -> RIGHT (6, 6) -> UP (7, 6) [EAT at T=31].\n\nI win the race for (7, 6) by a full turn. This is a much better target than (3, 2).\n\n**4. Check safety of RIGHT move:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 6).\nCollision checks:\n*   My body: (4, 6) is clear.\n*   Enemy body: (4, 6) is clear.\n*   Enemy head: Enemy head is at (6, 2). Since they are highly unlikely to reach (4, 6) in one move (they would need to pass through (5, 6) or crash into their own body parts), this is safe.\n\n**5. Long-term Path Check (RIGHT towards 7, 6):**\nT=27: Move RIGHT to (4, 6). Safe.\nT=28: Move RIGHT to (5, 6). Safe, clears space for (6, 8) tail to move out of the way.\nT=29: Move RIGHT to (6, 6). Safe.\nT=30: Move UP to (6, 7). Safe.\nT=31: Move RIGHT to (7, 7). Safe.\nT=32: Move DOWN to (7, 6). APPLE! Wait, my coordinate calculation for (7, 6) was wrong in Step 3.\n\nLet's recalculate the path to (7, 6) from (3, 6).\n(3, 6) to (7, 6) is 4 steps right.\n(3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6). Total 4 moves.\nI calculated only 4 moves earlier:\nT=27: (3, 6) -> RIGHT (4, 6) (Move 1)\nT=28: (4, 6) -> RIGHT (5, 6) (Move 2)\nT=29: (5, 6) -> RIGHT (6, 6) (Move 3)\nT=30: (6, 6) -> RIGHT (7, 6) (Move 4, EAT)\n\nI will reach (7, 6) on Turn 30.\nAssuming the enemy goes for (3, 2) (3 moves) and gets there on Turn 30.\n\nI must choose between:\n1. Concede (3, 2) and take (7, 6). Arrival Turn 30. (1 apple gain)\n2. Try to block the enemy going for (3, 2). (Risky and might leave both of us in bad positions).\n\nOption 1 is strategically sound. I get an apple on the same turn the enemy gets theirs, maintaining the 1-apple lead, and I move away from the highly congested left/center columns, which may prove beneficial for expansion.\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT to secure (7, 6).\n\nRIGHT",

The new body list is what is shown: (4, 6) is the neck, and (5, 9) is the new tail (assuming (5, 9) was what was vacated in the previous move). Wait, the board shows a T at (5, 9), so that is correct.\n*   **Enemy Head (0):** (5, 1). Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. Length: 7. Tail is (5, 3).\n    *   Note: Enemy moved from (6, 1) -> (5, 1) on Turn 28 (likely LEFT).

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (from 5, 6):**\n*   My Body segments: (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9).\n*   Enemy Body segments: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3).\n*   Tail Vacuoles (cells that will be clear if the snakes move and don't eat): My Tail: (5, 9). Enemy Tail: (5, 3).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. The enemy body (5, 4) is below/ahead of this.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Collides with my neck segment (4, 6). **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. No board edge, no body parts. This is the path to (7, 6).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves (Goal: Apple (7, 6) - 2 moves away)**\nWe are racing to (7, 6). I am at (5, 6).\nPath: (5, 6) -> RIGHT (6, 6) -> RIGHT (7, 6) [EAT]. I arrive on Turn 30.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (6, 6):** This continues the trajectory. Excellent.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Potential Conflicts**\nEnemy Head (0) is at (5, 1). Target apples: (1, 0), (3, 2).\n*   (3, 2) is 3 moves away: (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2). Arrives T=32 (if optimal path taken). Wait, it's 3 moves.\n    *   T=29: (4, 1) or (5, 2) or (6, 1) - wait, (6, 1) is enemy neck. (5, 1) -> (4, 1) LEFT.\n    *   T=30: (3, 1).\n    *   T=31: (3, 2) EAT.\n    *   The enemy might arrive at (3, 2) on Turn 31.\n\n*   (1, 0) is 5 moves away.\n\nIf the enemy moves toward (3, 2) with (5, 1) -> (4, 1) [LEFT]:\n*   T=29: Enemy (4, 1). My T=29: (6, 6). No collision risk.\n\nIf the enemy moves toward (1, 0) with (5, 1) -> (5, 0) [DOWN]:\n*   T=29: Enemy (5, 0). My T=29: (6, 6). No collision risk.\n\nThe enemy could move UP to (5, 2) or DOWN to (5, 0) or LEFT to (4, 1).\n*   (5, 2) is safe.\n*   (5, 0) is safe.\n*   (4, 1) is safe.\n*   (6, 1) is suicide (neck).\n\nThe enemy is far away and cannot interfere with my movement to (6, 6) or my arrival at (7, 6). Collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**4. Check instantaneous collision risk for RIGHT (6, 6):**\nThe cell (6, 6) is currently empty.\nEnemy head is at (5, 1). The furthest the enemy can reach is (6, 2), (7, 1), (5, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0). None of these reach (6, 6). Safe.\n\n**5. Alternative Moves:**\n*   UP (5, 7) or DOWN (5, 5) would delay securing (7, 6). We must prioritize this immediate win.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nMaintain the aggressive push toward apple (7, 6). The move is RIGHT. This sets me up for a guaranteed apple on Turn 30, extending my lead to 8 apples while the enemy is likely stuck at 6 for at least two more turns.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nT=30: Move RIGHT to (7, 6) and eat the apple. Re-evaluate apple targets afterwards. The remaining apples are (1, 0), (9, 5), (3, 2), (0, 2). My position after T=30 will be good for approaching (9, 5). The enemy is currently positioned to target the lower left apples. I should try to deny them (9, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

This is consistent with a move from (5, 6) to (6, 6). The last segment (5, 9) vacated on the previous turn is gone, and the new tail is (4, 9).\n*   **Enemy Head (0):** (4, 1).\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)].

Since I was targeting (7, 6), and I moved to (6, 6), I must move right again to eat it.\n\n**1.

(5, 4) is the current tail and will be the vacuole unless the enemy eats.\n*   Tail Vacuoles: My Tail: (4, 9) (will be safe). Enemy Tail: (5, 4) (will be safe).\n\n*   **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Avoids board edge, no body parts.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Avoids board edge. (6, 4) is enemy body, but (6, 5) is safe.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 6):** Collides with my neck segment (5, 6). **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 6):** This is an apple location! Safe movement path, leads to growth.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves (Goal: Apple (7, 6))**\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 6):** This immediately consumes the apple, increasing my lead and growing my length, making the enemy's life harder. This is the optimal move.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Collision Risk**\nEnemy Head (0) is at (4, 1).\nThe enemy is likely targeting (3, 2) or (1, 0) or (0, 2).\nTo pursue (3, 2): (4, 1) -> UP (4, 2) or RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT.\nIf the enemy moves toward (3, 2):\n*   To (4, 2) (UP)\n*   To (3, 1) (LEFT/DOWN)\nThe maximum reach of the enemy head this turn is 1 cell away from (4, 1).\nIt cannot reach (7, 6). No head-on collision or direct body collision risk.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Post-Eat (7, 6):**\nAfter eating, my head will be at (7, 6). Length will be 9. The remaining apples are (1, 0), (9, 5), (3, 2), (0, 2).\nFrom (7, 6), (9, 5) is the closest apple (2 right, 1 down).\nI should aim for (9, 5) next, while keeping an eye on the enemy. The enemy is still positioned down low for the cluster of apples (1, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move RIGHT is required to secure the apple at (7, 6). It is safe and highly beneficial.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter eating at (7, 6), I will pivot to claim the apple at (9, 5), possibly moving RIGHT toward (8, 6) or (7, 7) or (7, 5).

Time to analyze the current state and determine the best move.\n\n**Game State Analysis:**\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10 (0-9).\n*   **Apples:** (1, 0), (9, 5), (3, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4)\n*   **My Snake (1):**\n    *   Head: (7, 6)\n    *   Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9)] (Length 9)\n    *   Last Tail segment (vacuole if no eat): (4, 9)\n*   **Enemy Snake (0):**\n    *   Head: (3, 1)\n    *   Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)] (Length 7)\n    *   Last Tail segment (vacuole if no eat): (6, 4)\n\n*Observation:* My last move was RIGHT, which resulted in eating the apple at (7, 6). My current head is (7, 6). The provided body trace for turn 31 is consistent with having consumed the apple, as my length is 9. The old head (6, 6) is now the neck, and the tail (4, 9) has remained in place because I grew.\n\n**Objective:** Secure the next apple, prioritize safety, and maintain map control.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (from 7, 6):**\n*   **Current Occupied Cells (excluding head 7, 6):**\n    *   My Body: (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9).\n    *   Enemy Body: (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4). (Enemy head is 3, 1).\n    *   Apples: (1, 0), (9, 5), (3, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4).\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 7):** Safe. No body, no wall.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe. (6, 4) is enemy body, but (7, 5) is clear.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** Collision with neck segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. No body, no wall (up to x=9).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Available Apples & Proximity:**\nThe remaining apples are:\nA1: (1, 0)\nA2: (9, 5)\nA3: (3, 2)\nA4: (0, 2)\nA5: (2, 4)\n\nDistances from (7, 6) (Manhattan distance):\n*   (9, 5): |9-7| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Closest)\n*   (3, 2): |3-7| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n*   (2, 4): |2-7| + |4-6| = 5 + 2 = 7.\n*   (1, 0): 7 + 6 = 13.\n*   (0, 2): 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nThe apple at (9, 5) is the closest and most accessible.\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves based on (9, 5) Target:**\nIf I target (9, 5), I need to move East (RIGHT) and then South (DOWN).\n\n*   **Option 1: Move RIGHT (to 8, 6)**\n    *   Puts me closer to (9, 5). Next moves could be (9, 6) then (9, 5), or (8, 5) then (9, 5).\n    *   Maintains flexibility.\n*   **Option 2: Move DOWN (to 7, 5)**\n    *   Puts me closer to (9, 5) vertically. Next move must be RIGHT (to 8, 5) then (9, 5).\n*   **Option 3: Move UP (to 7, 7)**\n    *   Moves away from (9, 5). Only useful if planning a defensive maneuver or trying to trap the enemy later, but currently, securing apples is key.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are good moves towards (9, 5). Let's see if the enemy poses a threat or influences the choice.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis (Snake 0 at 3, 1):**\nThe enemy is long (7 segments) and located entirely in the lower left quadrant.\nTarget apples for the enemy: (1, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4).\n*   If Enemy moves UP (to 3, 2 - Apple): Safe.\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT (to 2, 1): Still close to apples.\n*   If Enemy moves DOWN (to 3, 0): Towards (1, 0).\n*   If Enemy moves RIGHT (to 4, 1): Into its own body segment (4, 1). **DEAD.** Wait, (4, 1) is the neck, so this is an immediate death for the enemy. The enemy will not move RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy will likely move towards (3, 2) (UP) or (2, 1) (LEFT) or (3, 0) (DOWN). No matter the move, the enemy is far from me and poses no imminent collision threat in the upper right.\n\n**5. Optimal Move Selection:**\nMoving RIGHT (8, 6) sets up the easiest path to (9, 5) via (9, 6) or (8, 5).\nMoving DOWN (7, 5) also sets up a good path, potentially (8, 5) then (9, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize the move that keeps me most central to the target apple and most flexible for surrounding the right side.\nFrom (7, 6), moving RIGHT to (8, 6) keeps the path to (9, 5) wide open along the 5th or 6th row.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 6):\nNext move: DOWN to (8, 5) or RIGHT to (9, 6).\n(9, 5) is only 1 move away from (9, 6) or 1 move away from (8, 5).\n\nLet's aim for the most direct path:\n(7, 6) -> RIGHT (8, 6)\n(8, 6) -> DOWN (8, 5)\n(8, 5) -> RIGHT (9, 5) [Eats]\n\nThis three-turn sequence seems safe and efficient, assuming no interference.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\n**Long Term Strategy Note:**\nContinue targeting (9, 5). Once that apple is secured, evaluate the state of the lower-left apples (1, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4). If the enemy has claimed several, pivot to controlling the center and attempting to cut off the enemy as it grows longer. My snake is significantly longer (9 vs 7 segments) and has scored more apples (8 vs 6). I must leverage this length advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

Check for collisions: (9, 6) is safe.\n2.  Next turn, DOWN to (9, 5) is an eat. Very safe.\n\n*If I move DOWN (to 8, 5):*\n1.  Check for collisions: (8, 5) is safe.\n2.  Next turn, RIGHT to (9, 5) is an eat. Very safe.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN lead to the apple (9, 5) in two moves. Let's consider the opponent's threat.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis (Snake 0 at 3, 2):**\nThe enemy is extremely far away. H0 is at (3, 2). It will target the lower-left apples: (1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 4). (3, 2) is currently an apple, meaning the enemy likely just moved UP and consumed it.\n*Correction:* The previous turn's state showed the apple at (3, 2) was present. Let's re-examine the enemy body and head to confirm.\nEnemy Head H0: (3, 2).\nEnemy Body starts at (3, 1).\nIf the enemy moved UP into (3, 2), it ate the apple and grew.\n\nState check:\nTurn 31 Enemy Head: (3, 1). Turn 31 Apples listed: (3, 2) was an apple.\nIf enemy moved UP: (3, 1) -> (3, 2). Ate apple. New head (3, 2). Body starts (3, 1). Length increased from 7 to 8.\nCurrent Enemy Length (T32): 8 segments (Head (3, 2) + 7 body segments).\nBody listed: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)] \u2014 7 body segments + H(3, 2) = 8 total length. This confirms the enemy ate at (3, 2) last turn.\n\nEnemy's immediate remaining targets: (1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 4).\n\nEnemy Safe Moves from (3, 2):\n*   UP to (3, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (3, 1): Collision with neck. **DEAD.**\n*   LEFT to (2, 2): Towards (0, 2). Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe.\n\nEnemy will likely move LEFT (towards (2, 2) or (2, 4)) or UP (toward the top of the column 3, but this area is congested with my old body).\n\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (2, 2) or UP to (3, 3), they are still far from me. I have time to secure (9, 5).\n\n**5. Final Decision between RIGHT (9, 6) and DOWN (8, 5):**\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 6) gives me strong control over the far right edge (x=9). It allows for (9, 6) -> (9, 5) (Eat).\nMoving DOWN to (8, 5) is slightly more central but requires crossing back to x=9 to eat.\n\nLet's move RIGHT to (9, 6). This secures the far eastern wall and ensures the next turn apple capture is quick and unblockable by the enemy.\n\n**Long Term Plan (Self-Correction/Strategy Update):**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (9, 6).\n2.  Next turn, move DOWN to (9, 5) and eat.\n3.  After eating, evaluate travel to (6, 7). My current long body [(7, 6)...(3, 9)] provides a strong barrier in the center-left. If the enemy is busy in the lower-left, target (6, 7). If the path is open, also consider (2, 4). I need to be careful not to trap myself in the corners, especially with my large body structure concentrated in column 3 and row 6.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy former tail (6, 3) will be empty if Snake 0 doesn't eat an apple.\n\n**Objective:** Eat the apple at (9, 5) immediately.\n\n**1. Safe Moves for Snake 1 (from 9, 6):**\n*   **UP to (9, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 5):** **Apple at (9, 5)! EATS.**\n*   **LEFT to (8, 6):** Collision with neck segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 6):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n\nOnly two safe moves: UP and DOWN (which results in an eat).\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Capture (9, 5):**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) is optimal. It secures the apple and prevents any risk of the enemy reaching it (they are far away). This increases my lead to 9 apples vs 7.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis (Snake 0 at 2, 2):**\nThe enemy is centered on the low-left quadrant. It likely just moved LEFT to (2, 2) (from 3, 2).\nEnemy's targets are (1, 0), (0, 2), (2, 4).\nSafe moves for H0 (2, 2):\n*   UP to (2, 3): Towards (2, 4). **Safe.**\n*   DOWN to (2, 1): **Safe.**\n*   LEFT to (1, 2): Towards (0, 2). **Safe.**\n*   RIGHT to (3, 2): Collision with neck. **DEAD.**\n\nIf the enemy moves to (2, 3) (towards A at 2, 4), or (1, 2) (towards A at 0, 2), they are solidifying their position in the lower left.\n\nThere is zero risk of collision with Snake 0 this turn. Snake 0 is far away and cannot reach (9, 5).\n\n**4. Move Selection:**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) is the clear winner as it secures an apple.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1.  Eat apple at (9, 5) by moving DOWN. T1 moves to (3, 7). Length becomes 10.\n2.  Next target: (6, 7). H1 will be at (9, 5).\n3.  Path to (6, 7): (9, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (approx 5 moves).\n4.  Alternatively, the apple at (2, 4) is now closer than the others, but accessing it requires navigating around my large body segment at column 3 and row 6.\n5. Post-eat position (9, 5) is slightly constrained by the wall. I will need to move LEFT and/or UP to start heading towards the center of the board again.\n\nDOWN",

Hmm, my former head at (9, 6) is now my neck, and the segment (8, 6) is the segment after that.\n        *   Let's check the body: H1(9, 5), S2(9, 6), S3(8, 6).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (8, 5):\n            *   From (8, 5), I can move: UP to (8, 6) (S3 of my body - **DEAD**), DOWN to (8, 4) (Safe), LEFT to (7, 5) (Safe), RIGHT to (9, 5) (S2 of my body - **DEAD**).\n        *   Wait, the body list is head-to-tail.\n        *   Current Body: (9, 6) [S2], (8, 6) [S3], (7, 6) [S4], (6, 6) [S5], (5, 6) [S6], (4, 6) [S7], (3, 6) [S8], (3, 7) [S9], (3, 8) [S10/Tail].\n\n        *   If I move LEFT to (8, 5):\n            *   Next turn H1 is at (8, 5).\n            *   (8, 6) is body segment 3. Moving UP is lethal.\n            *   (9, 5) is body segment 2. Moving RIGHT is lethal.\n            *   I am dangerously close to my own body regardless of which way I move due to the tight corner I am in.\n\nLet's re-examine the current constraints at H1(9, 5):\n1. UP to (9, 6) - My neck. DEAD.\n2. DOWN to (9, 4) - Safe.\n3. LEFT to (8, 5) - Safe.\n4. RIGHT - Wall. DEAD.\n\n**Scenario A: Move DOWN to (9, 4)**\n*   H1 moves to (9, 4).\n*   Body shifts: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), ... (3, 7). T1 at (3, 8) is vacated.\n*   Next turn from (9, 4):\n    *   UP (9, 5): Neck. DEAD.\n    *   DOWN (9, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (8, 4): Safe.\n    *   The wall constraint is severe here.\n\n**Scenario B: Move LEFT to (8, 5)**\n*   H1 moves to (8, 5).\n*   Body shifts: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), ... (3, 7). T1 at (3, 8) is vacated.\n*   Next turn from (8, 5):\n    *   UP (8, 6): S3 of body. DEAD.\n    *   DOWN (8, 4): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (7, 5): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (9, 5): Neck. DEAD.\n*   This also seems very constrained due to S3 at (8, 6).\n\n**Comparing Constraints:**\n*   Moving DOWN (9, 4) leaves me two safe options next turn (DOWN, LEFT).\n*   Moving LEFT (8, 5) leaves me two safe options next turn (DOWN, LEFT).\n\nHowever, (9, 7) is an attractive apple. To get there, I must move generally diagonally or UP/LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5):\nI can then go (8, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (Apple). This is 6 steps.\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 4):\nI can then go (9, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (7, 4) ... (6, 7). Same general path, (9, 4) to (8, 4) is 1 step, then 5 more. 6 steps total.\n\nThe apple (9, 7) is much closer horizontally: H1(9, 5). (9, 7) is just 2 steps UP. I cannot go UP.\n\nIf I go LEFT (8, 5): I am better positioned strategically to move towards (6, 7) which is a major target, and I avoid being trapped against the right/bottom walls.\n\nLet's look at the path to (9, 7) through the center after moving LEFT:\n(9, 5) -> LEFT (8, 5) [Safe]\n(8, 5) -> LEFT (7, 5) [Safe]\n(7, 5) -> UP (7, 6) [S4 of body] - **DEAD**. Oh, this is fatal. My body is at (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6).\n\nI need to avoid the entire 6th row if I move LEFT.\n(9, 5) -> LEFT (8, 5)\n(8, 5) -> DOWN (8, 4) (Safe) or LEFT (7, 5) (Safe)\n\nIf I aim for (6, 7):\n(9, 5) -> LEFT (8, 5)\n(8, 5) -> LEFT (7, 5)\n(7, 5) -> DOWN (7, 4)\n(7, 4) -> LEFT (6, 4)\n(6, 4) -> UP (6, 5)\n(6, 5) -> UP (6, 6) (S5 of body) - **DEAD**.\n\nMy entire body forms a long horizontal barrier in row 6: (9, 6) down to (3, 6). This makes accessing (6, 7) extremely difficult without the tail vacating (3, 6).\n\nWait, the tail is at (3, 8). If I don't eat, (3, 8) becomes empty. Length 10.\nAfter moving: Body (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7). Tail segment (3, 7) will move to (3, 6) next turn, vacating (3, 7) if I don't eat.\n\nLet's re-verify the body segments after the current move if I choose LEFT (8, 5):\nNew Body: H1(8, 5), S2(9, 5), S3(9, 6), S4(8, 6), S5(7, 6), S6(6, 6), S7(5, 6), S8(4, 6), S9(3, 6), S10(3, 7). (3, 8) vacated.\n\nNext Turn (T35) from (8, 5):\n*   To reach (6, 7) or (9, 7) I must move NORTH eventually.\n*   (8, 6) is S4. UP is DEAD.\n*   (9, 5) is S2. RIGHT is DEAD.\n\nI am essentially forced to move DOWN or LEFT to escape the trap created by my body structure.\n\nIf I choose to move DOWN to (9, 4):\nNew Body: H1(9, 4), S2(9, 5), S3(9, 6), S4(8, 6), S5(7, 6), S6(6, 6), S7(5, 6), S8(4, 6), S9(3, 6), S10(3, 7). (3, 8) vacated.\n\nNext Turn (T35) from (9, 4):\n*   UP (9, 5): Neck. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (9, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 4): Safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 4) keeps me safe and gives me space to maneuver towards the center by moving LEFT gradually. The apple at (9, 7) is still there, but I must circumvent my body.\n\nPath if I move DOWN, aiming for general freedom/center:\nT34: DOWN (9, 4). Length 10.\nT35: LEFT (8, 4). (9, 5) becomes S2, (9, 6) S3, (8, 6) S4.\nT36: LEFT (7, 4).\nT37: LEFT (6, 4).\nT38: UP (6, 5).\nT39: UP (6, 6) - **S6 of body**. DEAD.\n\nThis confirms the entire row 6 (from 9 down to 3) is a complete barrier for the next several turns. I must go below row 6 and then UP column 3 or even further left (column 2, 1).\n\nLet's look at Snake 0. H0 is at (2, 3), body segments at (2, 2), (3, 2). They are looking at A(2, 4) and A(0, 2). They have a clear path to (2, 4) by moving UP.\n\nAssume S0 moves UP to (2, 4) and eats. (Score 9-8)\nIf S0 eats: H0(2, 4), S2(2, 3), S3(2, 2)... Tail (6, 2) stays put. Length 9.\n\nIf I move DOWN (9, 4), I avoid S0 entirely.\n\nLong term goal: Get to the high region (6, 7) or (9, 7). Since row 6 is entirely blocked, I must go LOW (row 0-1) and then UP the left side.\n\nLet's track the position of my body at Row 6: (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6).\nThis spans 7 cells. My length is 10. The tail is at (3, 8).\n\nIf I move without eating, my segments shift.\n(3, 8) vacates. (3, 7) becomes the new tail. (3, 6) remains part of the wall.\n\nTo clear (3, 6), the tail needs to move 3 steps: (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) etc. I need 3 turns without eating for (3, 6) to vacate (assuming straight movement of the tail). This is too slow.\n\nThe only way to reach (6, 7) or (9, 7) is to move around the long body. Given the severe constraints, moving away from the body is essential.\n\n1. **Move DOWN (9, 4).**\n   - Safe.\n   - Next safe moves: (9, 3) (DOWN) or (8, 4) (LEFT).\n   - This leads me into the corner, but gives me two turns to get away from the vertical alignment of my neck.\n\n2. **Move LEFT (8, 5).**\n   - Safe.\n   - Next safe moves: (8, 4) (DOWN) or (7, 5) (LEFT).\n   - This puts me in a slightly better position laterally, one step closer to the left side where I need to be.\n\nLet's stick with LEFT (8, 5). It provides more momentum towards the center of the board rather than sticking to the far right edge.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nH1: (8, 5). Safe.\n\nFuture considerations:\nI need to get to low y values (row 0-1) and move left (x=0, 1, 2) to clear my horizontal mass and head UP towards the remaining apples in the upper left/center.\n\nT35 (from 8, 5): Choose DOWN (8, 4) or LEFT (7, 5). LEFT seems better to gain distance from the right wall and H0 is far left.\nT36 (from 7, 5): Possible moves: DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5), RIGHT (8, 5 - neck collision). LEFT (6, 5) is actually S6 block. (6, 6) is S7. I am now at (7, 5). Segment (6, 6) is the one to worry about.\nLet's see the new body segments at T36 (if I go 9, 5 -> 8, 5 -> 7, 5):\nH1(7, 5), S2(8, 5), S3(9, 5), S4(9, 6), S5(8, 6), S6(7, 6), S7(6, 6), S8(5, 6), S9(4, 6), S10(3, 6). Tail at (3, 7) is vacated.\n\nAt (7, 5), safe moves are: UP (7, 6) [S6 of body - DEAD], DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5) [Safe! S7 is at (6, 6)].\nAh, (6, 5) is safe! My body is structured horizontally at row 6.\n(7, 6) is S6. So UP is deadly.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 5) at T36:\nH1 moves to (6, 5). Now I am close to the dangerous row 6.\nT37 (from 6, 5): UP (6, 6) [S7 of body - DEAD], DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5 - neck).\nThis is good. It successfully bypasses the wall section (7, 6) by moving south of it.\n\nStrategy confirms: Move LEFT to increase maneuvering options and aim for the left side of the board to go north.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Length is 9.\nApples are at: (1, 0), (0, 2), (6, 7), (9, 7), (0, 3).\n\nMy goal is to escape the congested area near (8, 5) and move towards the center/left to bypass my long body segments blocking row 6.\n\n**My Snake State (ID 1) at (8, 5):**\nBody: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]\nNote: Since I did not eat last turn, the tail segment (3, 8) was vacated. My current body length is 10 (head + 9 body segments). The listed body segments are S2 through S10.\n\n**Enemy Snake State (ID 0) at (2, 4):**\nBody: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 from (8, 5):**\n*   **UP to (8, 6):** Collision with my body segment S4. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 4):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 5):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Collision with my neck segment S2. **DEAD**.\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (8, 4):**\n*   Pros: Increases distance from the central conflict area, opens up towards lower rows.\n*   Cons: Keeps me closer to the right side of the board.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (7, 5):**\n*   Pros: Moves me significantly towards the center/left, which is necessary to navigate around my body's horizontal barrier in row 6.\n*   Cons: Brings me slightly closer to my body segments (7, 6) and (6, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate Future Constraints based on Movement:**\n\nMy long-term strategy is to get far left (x=0, 1) and then move UP towards the apples (6, 7) or (0, 3). Row 6 is severely blocked: (9, 6) down to (3, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5):\nNew Body segments (S2, S3, S4, ...): (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6). Tail (3, 7) vacates.\n\nNext turn (T36) from (7, 5):\n*   UP to (7, 6): Collision with S6. **DEAD**.\n*   DOWN to (7, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (6, 5): Safe. (The next segment is S7 at (6, 6)).\n*   RIGHT to (8, 5): Neck collision. **DEAD**.\nTwo safe options: DOWN or LEFT. This is good. It confirms the rationale from the previous turn was sound. Moving LEFT to (7, 5) keeps options open.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 4):\nNew Body segments (S2, S3, S4, ...): (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6). Tail (3, 7) vacates.\n\nNext turn (T36) from (8, 4):\n*   UP to (8, 5): Neck collision. **DEAD**.\n*   DOWN to (8, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (7, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 4): Safe.\nThree safe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. More choices are available compared to moving LEFT initially.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT (8, 5) -> (7, 5) helps me get past the x=7 boundary faster, directly positioning me for a move towards x=6 or x=5. Moving DOWN (8, 4) requires me to spend an extra turn moving sideways (8, 4) -> (7, 4) to achieve the same x position. Since I am trying to cover horizontal distance quickly to bypass the row 6 obstruction, the LEFT move is strategically superior.\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Conflicts:**\nSnake 0 is at (2, 4). They are far away and likely moving towards low-x apples (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0) or potentially UP to higher y values. They pose no immediate threat to either of my safe moves.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nLEFT maintains momentum towards the strategic goal of gaining space on the left side of the board for a push north.\n\nLEFT",

(The next body segment is (6, 6) (S6)).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Collision with my neck (S2). **DEAD**.\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Safe Moves:**\nMy primary intermediate goal is to get around the wall of my body segments blocking rows 6 and 5 (which extends from x=9 to x=3). I need to continue moving LEFT or DOWN to eventually move UP safely.\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (6, 5):**\n*   Pros: Continues the strategic move towards the center/left. Positions me well to move down or to continue left.\n*   Cons: My head is now adjacent to my body segment (6, 6).\n\nFuture options from (6, 5):\n*   UP (6, 6): Collision with own body. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (6, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT (5, 5): Safe (5, 6) is S7.\n*   RIGHT (7, 5): Neck collision. DEAD.\nIf I move LEFT, I have 2 safe options next turn (DOWN, LEFT).\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (7, 4):**\n*   Pros: Creates distance from my own body wall in row 6. Opens up the possibility of moving right or left with less immediate body constraint.\n*   Cons: Loses momentum towards the far left side, where the most convenient apples are located relative to the enemy.\n\nFuture options from (7, 4):\n*   UP (7, 5): Neck collision. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (7, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (6, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 4): Safe (8, 5) is S2.\nIf I move DOWN, I have 3 safe options next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This gives me slightly more choice.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nThe immediate target apples are (6, 7) and (9, 7) (high up), and the (0, Y) apples (far left).\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 4). They are likely going for (0, 3) or (0, 2). They are short and mobile.\nI am long. My body is a significant constraint, effectively splitting the board horizontally along row 6.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 4): I maintain excellent safety as I have 3 safe choices, and I can move towards the center of the board (6, 4) or even loop back right temporarily (8, 4) if needed, which seems unlikely. This move gives me flexibility.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 5): I am limited to 2 choices, but I am closer to the left side strategically. The risk here is that if I move left again to (5, 5), I am right next to (5, 6) and (4, 6), which could narrow options quickly.\n\nGiven the density of my body to the left (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), it is beneficial to drop down a row before pushing further left. Moving DOWN to (7, 4) allows me to try to bypass my body structure by moving below it (in row 4/3) and then turning UP near the left wall (x=0, 1).\n\nCrucially, from (7, 4), moving LEFT to (6, 4) is safe and positions me right below the obstacle. This allows a diagonal downward movement around the body mass. A move to (7, 4) is safer and provides slightly better strategic flexibility than (6, 5).\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Conflicts:**\nSnake 0 is at (1, 4).\n*   If ID 0 moves UP to (1, 5): No conflict with my (7, 4) or (6, 5).\n*   If ID 0 moves DOWN to (1, 3): No conflict.\n*   If ID 0 moves LEFT to (0, 4): No conflict.\n*   If ID 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 4): No conflict.\n\nThere is no immediate danger of a head-on collision, as we are widely separated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN to (7, 4) maintains maximum safety (3 outgoing paths next turn) and strategically assists in maneuvering around my dense body mass in row 6/5 by moving to a lower row before resuming the push left.\n\nDOWN",

Length is 9.\n\n**My State (ID 1) Head: (7, 4)**\nBody: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\nThe tail segment (4, 6) will vacate if I don't eat.\n\n**Enemy State (ID 0) Head: (0, 4)**\nBody: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\nThe tail segment (5, 1) will vacate if ID 0 doesn't eat. Snake ID 0 is extremely close to two apples: (0, 3) and (0, 2). It will likely move towards them.\n\n**Apples:** (1, 0), (0, 2), (6, 7), (9, 7), (0, 3). The two apples on the left side are (0, 2) and (0, 3). ID 0 is positioned to grab them.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 from (7, 4):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 5):** Collision with my neck (7, 5). **DEAD**. (Self-collision, moving backwards)\n*   **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe. (My segment (8, 5) is one step away).\n\nI have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Safe Moves and Trajectory:**\n\nMy previous move was strategically to drop below the wall of my own body (rows 6 and 5) to maneuver left. My current goal remains to push leftwards into (6, 4) or (5, 4) territory, bypassing the dense body mass above.\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (6, 4):**\n*   Pros: Continues the strategic movement towards the center-left. Positions me below my main body structure (S6 is (6, 6)). Puts me two moves away from potential apples (0, Y) if ID 0 misses them or if I decide to aim for the higher apples (6, 7).\n*   Future options from (6, 4):\n    *   UP to (6, 5): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (6, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (5, 4): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (7, 4): Neck collision.\n    *   3 safe options. Good flexibility.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (7, 3):**\n*   Pros: Very safe. Keeps me central.\n*   Cons: Doesn't make progress towards the necessary maneuver left.\n*   The apple (0, 3) is far away in this direction.\n*   Future options from (7, 3):\n    *   UP to (7, 4): Neck collision.\n    *   DOWN to (7, 2): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (6, 3): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (8, 3): Safe.\n    *   3 safe options. Good flexibility, but less positional advantage.\n\n**C. Move RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n*   Pros: Safe.\n*   Cons: Moves me back towards the dense body mass on the right side and away from the center. Not strategically useful unless I plan to loop around the top, which is currently blocked by (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n*   Future options from (8, 4):\n    *   UP to (8, 5): Collision with body segment (8, 5). **DEAD**.\n    *   DOWN to (8, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 4): Neck collision.\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 4): Safe.\n    *   Only 2 safe options. Less flexible and risks getting trapped near the right wall.\n\n**3. Comparison and Decision:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 4) is the best strategic option. It maintains safety (3 next-turn options) while continuing the plan to maneuver around my own length. It positions me to pressure the center of the board.\n\n**4. External Hazards (Enemy Snake ID 0):**\n\nID 0 is at (0, 4). Length 9.\nPossible moves for ID 0:\n*   UP to (0, 5): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (0, 3): Eat apple (0, 3).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 4): Out of bounds. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 4): Collision with neck (1, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nID 0 MUST move UP or DOWN. Since (0, 3) is an apple, ID 0 will almost certainly move $\\rightarrow$ DOWN to (0, 3) and eat. Its head location next turn will be (0, 3), and its length will become 10.\n\nIf ID 1 moves LEFT to (6, 4), we are separated by a large distance (6 units in x, 1 unit in y). No collision risk.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Check:**\nBy moving LEFT to (6, 4) and then potentially further LEFT to (5, 4), and then (4, 4), I create space below my body. Once I pass (4, 6), I could potentially turn UP and move along the left side, or aim for the central upper apples (6, 7). ID 0 will likely clean up (0, 3) and (0, 2). I need to aim for (6, 7) or (9, 7).\n\nSince I am safely moving into (6, 4), this consolidates my position for the next few turns of leftward movement.\n\nLEFT\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe current turn is 37.\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (7, 4). I have three safe moves: DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4).\nEnemy snake (ID 0) is at (0, 4), effectively trapped between its neck (1, 4) and the wall/death (LEFT). It must move UP to (0, 5) or DOWN to (0, 3). Since (0, 3) is an apple, ID 0 will highly likely move DOWN and eat.\n\nStrategic Goal: Continue moving LEFT and DOWN to bypass my own long body structure (in rows 5, 6) and gain open space, then aim for apples (6, 7) or (9, 7).\n\n1.  Move RIGHT to (8, 4) results in only 2 safe options next turn (DOWN, RIGHT), and risks collision with my body (8, 5) if I tried UP on the next move. This is restrictive.\n2.  Move DOWN to (7, 3) maintains safety (3 options) but delays the necessary leftward progress.\n3.  Move LEFT to (6, 4) maintains safety (3 options: UP, DOWN, LEFT) and optimally continues the strategic maneuver to escape my body mass. This is the path of highest utility right now.\n\nNo immediate collision risk with ID 0.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

(My body is at (6, 6), (7, 5)).\n*   **DOWN to (6, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 4):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Collision with my neck (7, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake (ID 0) Moves from (0, 3):**\n\nID 0 Body: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1).\nTail (5, 1) will vacate if ID 0 doesn't eat.\n\nApple at (0, 2).\n\n*   **UP to (0, 4):** Collision with neck (0, 4). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 2):** **Eats Apple!** This is highly likely.\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 3):** Out of bounds. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Safe.\n\nID 0 will almost certainly move DOWN to (0, 2) and eat. If it moves to (1, 3), it avoids eating but makes sense if it's trying to cut off an entry point, which seems unlikely given the rich food directly available. Assume ID 0 moves DOWN to (0, 2).\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Options:**\n\nMy current position (6, 4) is good, continuing the leftward maneuver below my main body mass. The central/upper apples (6, 7), (9, 7), (5, 7) are the next targets, as ID 0 is cleaning up the left-bottom corner.\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (5, 4):**\n*   Pros: Continues movement away from my dense right side. Puts me 1 step closer to the center if I aim UP later (e.g., to (5, 5)).\n*   Cons: My current tail (5, 6) is two steps above (5, 4). This move maintains maximum path flexibility.\n*   Next turn from (5, 4): UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3), LEFT (4, 4). All safe. (3 options).\n\n**B. Move UP to (6, 5):**\n*   Pros: Starts moving towards the higher apples (6, 7) and (5, 7).\n*   Cons: Moves closer to my body segments (7, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6). Requires caution.\n*   Next turn from (6, 5): UP (6, 6) (collision - **DEAD**), DOWN (6, 4) (neck - DE), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5) (collision - **DEAD**).\n*   Wait, let's recheck collisions from (6, 5).\n    *   Body segments: (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6).\n    *   (6, 5) UP to (6, 6): Collision with body segment (6, 6). **DEAD**.\n    *   (6, 5) RIGHT to (7, 5): Collision with body segment (7, 5). **DEAD**.\n*   This direction is highly restrictive for the next turn, leaving only LEFT to (5, 5) and DOWN to (6, 4) (which is a reversal). This is dangerous. I should avoid UP.\n\n**C. Move DOWN to (6, 3):**\n*   Pros: Very safe. Provides space below my body structure.\n*   Cons: Doesn't make direct progress towards the upper apples.\n*   Next turn from (6, 3): UP (6, 4) (neck - D), DOWN (6, 2), LEFT (5, 3), RIGHT (7, 3). All safe (3 options).\n\n**4. Decision:**\n\nI need to continue creating space and flexibility. Moving LEFT to (5, 4) is the most progressive move that maintains good future options (3 safe spots: UP, DOWN, LEFT). From (5, 4), I can move up to (5, 5) and then (5, 6) (which is the tail location, so guaranteed safe) if I need to attack the central apples (5, 7) or (6, 7).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 3), I am safe but spend a turn moving vertically when horizontal movement is needed to gain open territory.\n\nI will choose LEFT to continue maneuvering out of the cluster.\n\n**5. Collision Check (ID 1 (5, 4) vs ID 0 (0, 2)):**\nNo immediate risk. The snakes are far apart.\n\n**6. Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT down to (4, 4) or (3, 4), then start moving UP along the x=3 or x=4 axis to attack the apples (5, 7), (6, 7), or (9, 7).\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Length 11 (It ate the apple at (0, 2) on Turn 38).\nBody (Recalculated based on Turn 38 analysis: ID 0 moved DOWN from (0, 3) to (0, 2) and ate):\nNew Head: (0, 2)\nNew Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\nTail segment (5, 1) *will not* vacate. (Wait, the provided board state shows ID 0 at (0, 2) and the listed enemy body is [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]. This confirms ID 0 ate and is length 11. My earlier analysis was correct.)\nTail (5, 1) will vacate if ID 0 doesn't eat *this turn*.\n\nApples: (1, 0), (6, 7), (9, 7), (5, 7), (4, 4).\nNote the apple at (4, 4) is now very close to my head (5, 4).\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for My Snake (ID 1) from (5, 4):**\n\nCurrent Occupied Cells (ID 1 body): (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6).\nTail segment (6, 6) will vacate.\n\n*   **UP to (5, 5):** Safe. No body collision.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 4):** **Eats Apple!** (4, 4) is an apple location. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Collision with my neck (6, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (Apple!).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake (ID 0) Moves from (0, 2):**\n\nID 0 Body: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1).\nTail (5, 1) will vacate. Apple at (1, 0) and potentially other places it could head.\n\nPossible moves for ID 0:\n*   **UP to (0, 3):** Collision with neck (0, 3). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 1):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 2):** Out of bounds. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 2):** Safe.\n\nID 0 is limited to DOWN (towards apple at (1, 0)) or RIGHT (moving into denser area). Since (1, 0) is the last remaining bottom-left apple, ID 0 will likely move DOWN to (0, 1).\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Options:**\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (4, 4): (EATS APPLE)**\n*   Pros: Gain 1 length, 1 point. Clears a nearby obstacle/food source. Puts me at (4, 4), which is central. Length increases to 11, and my tail (6, 6) *will not* vacate.\n*   Next turn from (4, 4): UP (4, 5), DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4). All safe. (3 options).\n\n**B. Move UP to (5, 5):**\n*   Pros: Moves towards the cluster of apples (5, 7), (6, 7), (9, 7).\n*   Cons: Doesn't capitalize on the immediate apple.\n*   Next turn from (5, 5): UP (5, 6) (tail frees up, safe), DOWN (5, 4) (neck - D), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5). 3 safe options.\n\n**C. Move DOWN to (5, 3):**\n*   Pros: Safe.\n*   Cons: Does not pursue apples aggressively, moves away from the upper cluster.\n\n**4. Decision:**\n\nThere is an immediate apple at (4, 4). Eating it gives me a length advantage (11 vs 11 after the move, but I gain flexibility since I ate and ID 0 likely didn't) and score advantage. This is the optimal tactical move.\n\nBy moving LEFT to (4, 4) and eating:\n*   My head is at (4, 4).\n*   My neck is (5, 4).\n*   My new body remains: (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6).\n*   My length is 11.\n*   My future options remain good (UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe).\n*   This also positions me well to aim UP towards (4, 5) or (3, 4) to bypass the main central area and aim for the upper apples.\n\nI must choose the apple at (4, 4).\n\n**5. Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating at (4, 4), I will aim UP towards the (5, 7), (6, 7) apples. I will likely move to (4, 5) next, then (4, 6) or (3, 5). ID 0 is focused on the bottom edge and is unlikely to interfere immediately.\n\nLEFT",

No collision.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Collision with my neck (5, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nI have three safe tactical options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake (ID 0) Potential Moves from (1, 2):**\n\nID 0 Body: (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1).\nTail (4, 1) will vacate.\n\n*   **UP to (1, 3):** Safe. Adjacent to my body at (4, 4) but far enough.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Moves toward apple at (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (0, 2):** Collision with neck (0, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe (tail at (4, 1) means (2, 2) is occupied by its 8th segment). Collision with its own body segment (2, 2). **DEAD**. Wait, let's recheck the body listing for ID 0: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]. (2, 2) is the 7th segment *counting from the head as 0*. Yes, moving into (2, 2) is self-collision. This leaves (1, 3) (UP) and (1, 1) (DOWN) as ID 0's safe moves.\n\nSince ID 0 is positioned at (1, 2) and the apple (1, 0) is nearby, ID 0 is overwhelmingly likely to move DOWN to (1, 1) to prepare for eating (1, 0) next turn. If ID 0 moves UP to (1, 3), it moves slightly away from the apple.\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Options (ID 1 from (4, 4)):**\n\nMy primary goal is to reach the cluster of apples at x=5, x=6, x=9, y=7 and y=9. I need to move UP.\n\n**Option A: UP to (4, 5).**\n*   Pros: Direct path towards the high-value apples (5, 7), (6, 7), (9, 7), (7, 9). Moves away from potential conflict with ID 0.\n*   Next turn from (4, 5): UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4) (neck - D), LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5). 3 safe options. (5, 5) frees up a path to (5, 7).\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (4, 3).**\n*   Pros: Safe.\n*   Cons: Moves towards the bottom of the board and potential conflict with ID 0, and away from current apple cluster.\n\n**Option C: LEFT to (3, 4).**\n*   Pros: Safe.\n*   Cons: Seems tangential to the main objective (upper apples).\n\n**4. Decision:**\n\nMoving UP to (4, 5) best facilitates my long-term strategy of securing the upper apples whilst keeping ID 0 contained in the bottom-left area. This move is perfectly safe, and sets me up for a follow-up move to (4, 6) or (5, 5) towards the apples.\n\nLet's check potential collisions with ID 0 movement:\nIf I move (4, 5) and ID 0 moves (1, 1) or (1, 3), we remain safely separated.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 5), my path looks promising. I can proceed (4, 6) & (5, 6), then turn towards (5, 7) or (4, 7).\n\nI will choose UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving UP and RIGHT to capture the cluster of apples in the top half of the board (y>5). (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7) [Apple!].\n\nUP",

This cell will be vacated next turn if ID 0 doesn't eat an apple.\n*   **Apples:** (1, 0), (6, 7), (9, 7), (5, 7), (7, 9).\n\n**Goal:** Continue moving towards the cluster of apples in the upper half of the board (y=7, y=9). Specifically, (5, 7) is my primary target as it involves the fewest moves.\n\n**1. Analyze My Safe Moves from (4, 5):**\n\nThe next segment (neck) is (4, 4).\nOccupied cells by ID 1 (current body): (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6).\n\n*   **UP to (4, 6):** Safe.

No collision.\n\nThree safe tactical options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake (ID 0) Potential Moves from (1, 1):**\n\nID 0's next segment (neck) is (1, 2).\nID 0's target is likely the apple at (1, 0).\n\n*   **UP to (1, 2):** Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 0):** Apple! Safe move. Highly probable move.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 1):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Safe.\n\nID 0 is almost certainly going DOWN to (1, 0) to eat the apple.\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Options (ID 1 from (4, 5)):**\n\nI want to move closer to (5, 7).\n\n*   **Option A: RIGHT to (5, 5).**\n    *   Pros: Moves towards the x-coordinate of the target apple (5, 7). This puts me in a good position to move UP to (5, 6) next turn, and then potentially UP to (5, 7) (apple!).\n*   **Option B: UP to (4, 6).**\n    *   Pros: Moves closer to the y-coordinate of the target apples.\n    *   Cons: If I move UP, I might block my own path towards (5, 7) if I don't turn right quickly. If I go (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7), it works, but (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7) is potentially faster.\n*   **Option C: LEFT to (3, 5).**\n    *   Cons: Moves away from all upper apples. Less strategic.\n\nComparing RIGHT and UP:\n(4, 5) -> RIGHT (5, 5). Next turn, I can go UR to (5, 6). Then UP to (5, 7) [Apple]. Total 2 moves to reach (5, 7) from (5, 5).\n(4, 5) -> UP (4, 6). Next turn, I can go U/R. If RIGHT (5, 6). Then UP to (5, 7) [Apple]. Total 2 moves to reach (5, 7) from (4, 6).\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP lead to the apple (5, 7) in two more moves (total 3 moves from the start of T41).\n\nLet's check potential conflicts. My tail will be at (7, 6).\nThe move to (5, 5) keeps me centered and ready to ascend the central column.\nThe move to (4, 6) keeps me on the less crowded left side for now.\n\nBoth (4, 6) and (5, 5) are very safe and strategically sound. I choose **RIGHT** (5, 5) because it puts me directly in the lane of the (5, 7) apple.\n\n**Path Check (assuming RIGHT):**\nT41: (4, 5) -> (5, 5). (Safe)\nT42: (5, 5) -> (5, 6) (Assuming UP) or (6, 5) (Assuming RIGHT). (5, 4) is my body but it will be vacated as tail is (7, 6). Wait, let's recheck body path.\nMy body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 5), my previous head (4, 5) becomes the new neck. The body shifts.\nThe cell (5, 4) is currently 3rd segment. (6, 4) is 4th.\n\nNew body sequence T41 (not eating, length 11, tail vacates (7, 6)):\nHead: (5, 5)\nBody: (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6).\nNew Tail: (8, 6). The cell (7, 6) is free.\n\nNow, T42 moves from (5, 5):\n*   UP to (5, 6): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (5, 4): Safe (as (5, 4) is 4th segment, and (8, 6) is tail). Wait, if I move down to (5, 4), I hit my own segment unless it's the tail slot. (8, 6) is the tail, so (5, 4) is *not* vacated. **(5, 4) is occupied.** Self-collision.\n*   LEFT to (4, 5): Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 5), my safe choices next turn are UP (5, 6) or RIGHT (6, 5). This keeps me headed towards the apples.\n\n**Path Check (assuming UP):**\nT41: (4, 5) -> (4, 6). (Safe)\nNew body sequence T41 (not eating, length 11, tail vacates (7, 6)):\nHead: (4, 6)\nBody: (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6).\nNew Tail: (8, 6).\n\nNow, T42 moves from (4, 6):\n*   UP to (4, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (4, 5): Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n*   LEFT to (3, 6): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 6): Safe.\n\nBoth UP (4, 6) and RIGHT (5, 5) are very good moves, providing two safe options next turn that move toward the target apple (5, 7).\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), I approach the top region slightly faster (y=6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), I get onto the x-coordinate of the apple (x=5) faster.\n\nLet's stick with the plan to align with the primary target (5, 7). Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) is the most direct alignment.\n\n**Final Check:**\nID 1 Head: (4, 5). Going RIGHT to (5, 5).\nID 0 Head: (1, 1). Likely going DOWN to (1, 0) (eats apple).\nNo collision risk.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

This cell will be vacated next turn if I don't eat an apple.\n    *   I did not eat an apple last turn.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (1, 0). (Enemy moved DOWN from (1, 1) and ate the apple at (1, 0)).\n    *   Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n    *   Length: 12 (Grew by 1).\n    *   Tail segment: (3, 1). Tail does *not* move because the apple was eaten.\n*   **Apples:** (6, 7), (9, 7), (5, 7), (7, 9), (5, 2).\n\n**Objective:** My primary target is the apple at (5, 7), as I am now aligned on x=5. I need to move UP. Secondary targets are (6, 7) and (7, 9).\n\n**1. Analyze My Safe Moves from (5, 5):**\n\nOccupied cells by ID 1 (current body): (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 6):** Safe. No body collision.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 4):** Collision with body segment (5, 4). **DEAD**. (This segment is 4th in the body list).\n*   **LEFT to (4, 5):** Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe. No body collision.\n\nTwo safe tactical options: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake (ID 0) Position and Threat:**\n\nEnemy head is at (1, 0). The enemy is currently far away on the bottom left corner. They just ate an apple and their path is likely constrained by their body and the walls. The enemy is long (L=12) and currently boxed in.\n\nPossible moves for ID 0 from (1, 0):\n*   UP to (1, 1): Collision with neck. DEAD.\n*   DOWN to (1, -1): Off-board. DEAD.\n*   LEFT to (0, 0): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 0): Safe.\n\nIf ID 0 moves LEFT (0, 0) or RIGHT (2, 0), they are safe. They are unlikely to pose a threat to my immediate movement towards the upper apples.\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Options (ID 1 from (5, 5)):**\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (5, 6).**\n    *   Pros: Directly moves towards the primary target apple (5, 7). This is the shortest path to eat (5, 7) next turn (T43).\n    *   Cons: None apparent.\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (6, 5).**\n    *   Pros: Keeps me moving and safe. If (5, 7) is somehow blocked or less appealing, I could aim for (6, 7) next.\n    *   Cons: Delays reaching (5, 7).\n\nSince I am perfectly positioned to hit the apple (5, 7) with an UP move this turn and another UP move next turn, going UP to (5, 6) is the highest priority move.\n\n**4. Final Move Selection (UP):**\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6):\nT42: (5, 5) -> (5, 6). Safe.\nT43: From (5, 6), I can move UP to (5, 7) and eat an apple. (My body segment (5, 5) becomes the neck. (5, 7) is safe to enter).\nThis path is quick and efficient.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 5):\nT42: (5, 5) -> (6, 5). Safe.\nT43: From (6, 5), to reach (5, 7) I would need to go UP to (6, 6) or (6, 5) -> (7, 5) (hitting my body). If UP to (6, 6).\nT44: From (6, 6), I could go LEFT to (5, 6) or UP/RIGHT to (6, 7) or (7, 6).\nThis path is slower to (5, 7) and potentially (6, 7).\n\nUP is the clear best strategic choice.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nTarget (5, 7) on T43. After eating, I should evaluate if (6, 7) or (7, 9) is more accessible, while keeping an eye on the enemy. The enemy is currently far away, but its length (L=12) gives it control over the lower left quadrant. I have gained a temporary lead in positioning for the upper apples.\n\nUP",

I am Snake 1.\n\n**Game State Analysis (Turn 43)**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (5, 6)\n    *   Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n    *   Length: 11.\n    *   Tail segment: (9, 6). This cell will be vacated next turn if I don't eat an apple.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 0). (Enemy moved RIGHT from (1, 0)).\n    *   Body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n    *   Length: 12.\n    *   Tail segment: (3, 2). This cell will be vacated next turn.\n*   **Apples:** (6, 7), (9, 7), (5, 7), (7, 9), (5, 2).\n\n**Objective:** The immediate objective is the apple at (5, 7). I am positioned at (5, 6), right next to it.\n\n**1. Analyze My Safe Moves from (5, 6):**\n\nOccupied cells by ID 1 (current body, excluding potential tail release): (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** This is an apple! Safe move and guarantees growth.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe. Vacant cell.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Vacant cell.\n\nMoves UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe in terms of self-collision.\n\n**2. Analyze External Threats (Walls, Enemy Snake):**\n\n*   **Walls:** No immediate wall threat for UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n*   **Enemy (ID 0) Head:** (2, 0). The enemy is very far away and cannot reach my vicinity this turn.\n\n**3. Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (5, 7) (Apple).**\n    *   This is the best move. I eat an apple, increase my score, and grow by 1 segment. My head ends up in a central, high position.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (4, 6).**\n    *   Avoids the apple. Delays growth. Poor decision given the proximity of the apple.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (6, 6).**\n    *   Avoids the apple. While (6, 7) is an apple, reaching it is slower this way than securing (5, 7) first.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) is the optimal move. It grants an apple immediately and positions me well for the cluster of apples at (6, 7) and (7, 9).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T44):**\nAfter eating apple (5, 7), my head will be at (5, 7). Length will be 12.\nThe apples nearby will be (6, 7) and (7, 9).\nI should aim for (6, 7) next, likely by moving RIGHT to (6, 7) from (5, 7). This will be a short, direct move towards the next available food source. The enemy is still constrained in the bottom corner, but I must remain aware of its movements.\n\nUP",

Check for Immediate Fatalities (Self-Collision & Walls):**\n\n*   UP (5, 8): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (6, 7): Safe (Apple).\n\n**3. Check for Enemy Collision:**\n\nEnemy Head (0) is at (3, 0). Its immediate moves can be (2, 0) LEFT, (3, 1) UP, or (4, 0) RIGHT. None of these moves bring it anywhere close to my potential moves (4, 7), (5, 8), or (6, 7). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**4. Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 7):** This is an apple. Eating it secures another point and allows me to grow further, consolidating my position in the top-right quadrant where multiple apples remain (9, 7), (7, 9), (9, 9). This is the best move.\n*   **Move UP to (5, 8):** Safe, but moves away from the nearest apple. Positions me slightly closer to (7, 9) or (9, 9), but passing up (6, 7) is inefficient.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 7):** Safe, but moves away from the dense apple area.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 7) is optimal as it secures a second consecutive apple and maintains momentum in the apple-rich area of the board.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T45):**\nMy head will be at (6, 7). Length will be 13, and the tail (9, 6) remains.\nThe remaining high-priority apples are (9, 7), (7, 9), and (9, 9).\nFrom (6, 7), I should aim for (7, 7) or (6, 8) to access the next apples. (7, 9) is attractive.\nIf I move UP to (6, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 7), I keep the pressure high. I should watch the enemy's vertical movement, though they are still far. Prioritize (7, 9) or (9, 7). Given the current position, aiming for (7, 9) seems slightly better as it is more central in the cluster.\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze Next Possible Moves from (6, 7):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 8):** Empty space. Good towards (7, 9), (9, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (6, 6):** Collision with body segment (6, 6) is currently occupied by segment (6, 7)'s predecessor (5, 7) but wait, (6, 6) is actually free. My body is at (5, 7) (neck). (6, 6) is clear.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 7):** Collision with body segment (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Empty space. Good towards (9, 7), (7, 9)\n\n**2. Check for Immediate Fatalities (Self-Collision, Enemy Body, Walls):**\n\n*   **UP (6, 8):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (6, 6):** Safe. Segment (5, 7) is my neck. The coordinates are: (6, 7) H -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6). (6, 6) is empty.\n*   **LEFT (5, 7):** Self-collision (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 8), DOWN (6, 6), RIGHT (7, 7).\n\n**3. Check for Enemy Collision:**\n\nEnemy head N is at (3, 1). Its closest potential move towards me is UP to (3, 2), or RIGHT to (4, 1). It is too far for a head-on collision or collision with my immediate future path.\n\n**4. Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n\nI have a cluster of apples in the top right: (9, 7), (7, 9), (9, 9). (5, 2) and (0, 9) are farther away. I should prioritize the top-right cluster.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 7):** This is the most direct path toward (9, 7) (2 steps away) and positions me well for (7, 9) (2 steps away). It keeps my options open.\n    *   If I move R, the next turn I can go R to (8, 7) (getting closer to (9, 7)) or UP to (7, 8) (getting closer to (7, 9)).\n*   **Move UP to (6, 8):** Puts me closer to (7, 9) (2 steps away via (7, 8) or 3 steps via (6, 9)).\n    *   If I move UP, the next turn I can go R to (7, 8) or UP to (6, 9).\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 6):** This moves me away from the apple cluster and doesn't seem strategically beneficial right now.\n\nComparing UP (6, 8) and RIGHT (7, 7): Both are good. (7, 7) gives me slightly more immediate access to two apples simultaneously (9, 7) and (7, 9) and keeps me along the border area which is currently less contested.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT (7, 7)**.\n\nFrom (7, 7):\n*   Target (9, 7): R, R (2 moves)\n*   Target (7, 9): U, U (2 moves)\n*   Target (9, 9): R, U, U or U, R, R (3 moves)\n\nThis move maintains pressure and flexibility in the apple-rich quadrant.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T46):**\nHead will be at (7, 7). Tail (9, 6) will be vacated.\nNext targets are (9, 7) and (7, 9). Since (7, 9) is on the edge and perhaps strategically easier to secure, if (7, 7) is reached, look to move UP to (7, 8) to target (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 7) to target (9, 7). Given the dense apple cluster, I should probably prioritize the edge (7, 9) or (9, 7) to avoid getting congested in the middle. Moving right towards (9, 7) seems slightly more efficient in terms of covering space and setting up for (9, 9). I should aim for (9, 7) first unless a clear path to (7, 9) is better.\n\nRIGHT",

Dead.\n*   LEFT (2, 2): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (4, 2): Safe (Apple at (5, 2) is tempting).\n\nThe enemy is far away from me. No risk of immediate head-on collision or collision with my body.\n\n**3. Evaluate Strategic Options:**\n\nI am in the top-right corner cluster of apples: (9, 7), (7, 9), (9, 9). I need to secure one rapidly.\n\n*   Apple (9, 7): 2 moves via (8, 7), (9, 7).\n*   Apple (7, 9): 2 moves via (7, 8), (7, 9).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT put me on a 2-move path to an apple.\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 8):** Targets (7, 9). If successful, I'm already high up, potentially setting up for (9, 9) next (2 moves from (7, 9) to (9, 9) via (8, 9)).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 7):** Targets (9, 7). If successful, I'm on the right edge, potentially setting up for (9, 9) next (2 moves from (9, 7) to (9, 9) via (9, 8)).\n\nBoth moves are excellent. Let's compare the follow-up positions.\n\nIf I move **UP to (7, 8)**:\nNext turn (T47) I can move UP to (7, 9) (Apple).\nIf I move **RIGHT to (8, 7)**:\nNext turn (T47) I can move RIGHT to (9, 7) (Apple).\n\nBoth apples are on edges. There is slightly more space moving right along the edge (A at (9, 7), then (9, 8), A at (9, 9)).\n\nAlso, moving UP to (7, 8) leaves my path open for the enemy to potentially encroach, although they are far. Moving RIGHT to (8, 7) utilizes the wall, which is often safer.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT (8, 7)** to target (9, 7) and hug the wall. This move maintains access to the edge apples (9, 7) and (9, 9).\n\n**4. Alternative consideration: Enemy target?**\nThe enemy at (3, 2) is closest to (5, 2) (3 moves away: (4, 2), (5, 2) or (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), ... it's farther than 2 straight moves). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 2) or LEFT/UP to patrol their area, they are not a threat to the top right region yet. I have time to secure at least one of these adjacent apples.\n\nChoosing RIGHT seems safest and most direct for the next sequence of apples (9, 7) -> (9, 9).\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T47):**\nHead will be at (8, 7). I should move RIGHT to (9, 7) to eat the apple. After eating (9, 7), I will look to move UP towards (9, 9). If snake 0 somehow gets into the northern area, I will adjust, but currently, exploiting this corner seems paramount. I need to keep the score lead growing.\n\nRIGHT",

Confirm Move & Future Strategy:**\n\nThe move is clearly RIGHT to eat the apple at (9, 7).\n\nIf I eat the apple:\nMy new head will be at (9, 7). Length increases to 14.\nMy tail at (8, 5) will remain, as I ate an apple.\n\nNext turn (T48), from (9, 7), I will have access to:\n*   UP to (9, 8). (Towards (9, 9) apple)\n*   DOWN to (9, 6). (Wall)\n*   LEFT to (8, 7). (My neck)\n*   RIGHT (Off board). (Wall/Death)\n\nThe priority will be the apple at (9, 9) or (7, 9).

Direct path to (9, 9) apple.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 6):** Off board (y=6 is boundary in this view, but actually (9, 6) is on board). Let's check the board visual: (9, 6) is an empty space. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (8, 7):** Collision with body (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 7):** Off board (x=10). **DEAD**.\n\nImmediate safe moves: UP (9, 8), DOWN (9, 6).\n\n**2. Evaluate Goals and Strategy:**\n\nI am currently at (9, 7). Apples are close at (9, 9) and (7, 9).\nMy primary goal is to secure the nearest apple, which is (9, 9).\n\n*   Moving UP to (9, 8) puts me one move away from (9, 9).\n*   Moving DOWN to (9, 6) is safe, but leads away from the high-value apples in the top right.\n\nThe apple at (8, 6) is also close, accessible via DOWN, then LEFT to (8, 6). However, (9, 9) is only two moves away via UP, UP.\n\n**3. Check for Enemy Interference/Head-on Collision:**\n\nEnemy Head (0H) is at (5, 2). The enemy is far away and currently focused on the bottom/left side of the board. They pose no head-on threat to the top right corner.\n\nWhat will the enemy do?\nEnemy (5, 2) is long (length 13). It might try to move UP towards the center, or LEFT or DOWN to clear space.\nSafe moves for 0:\n*   UP (5, 3): Clear. This gives access to the central area.\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Clear.\n*   LEFT (4, 2): Body. Dead.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Clear.\n\nIf 0 moves UP to (5, 3), it is still very far away. If 0 moves to (6, 2) it seems to be going across the bottom half. If 0 moves DOWN to (5, 1) it blocks itself potentially. UP to (5, 3) seems like the most strategic retreat/expansion for 0.\n\nRegardless of the enemy's move, my chosen move (UP to (9, 8)) is safe.\n\n**4. Select the Best Move:**\n\nMoving UP to (9, 8) is the most direct path to the apple at (9, 9). If I eat that apple, I will be very long and have a dominant position in the top right.\n\n**5. Alternative Analysis: The (8, 6) Apple**\nThe apple at (8, 6) is only two moves away: DOWN to (9, 6), then LEFT to (8, 6).\nThe apple at (9, 9) is also two moves away: UP to (9, 8), then UP to (9, 9).\nBoth are excellent options.\n\n(9, 9) is on the very edge of the board, which can sometimes be tricky for maneuvering if the snake is long. However, once secure, I can start moving towards (7, 9).\n\nLet's prioritize the higher apple (9, 9).\n\nMove: UP to (9, 8).\n\n**Future Strategy (T49+):**\nFrom (9, 8), move UP to (9, 9) to eat the apple.\nAfter eating (9, 9), I will be at (9, 9) (very long, length 15).\nNext, I can drop down and move LEFT along y=9 towards (7, 9) or navigate towards (8, 6) if the path is clear.\nIf I turn LEFT towards (8, 9), I'd be aiming for (7, 9). Route: (9, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (7, 9). This is a good sequence.\n\nUP",

Length 13.\n*   **Apples:** (7, 9), (9, 9), (0, 9), (0, 0), (8, 6).\n\nThe apple at (9, 9) is one move away. This is my immediate, high-priority target.\n\n**1. Analyze Next Possible Moves from Head (9, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (9, 9):** Apple! Safe move. Eat apple, length increases to 15.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 7):** Collision with body segment (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT to (8, 8):** Empty space. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 8):** Off board (x=10). **DEAD**.\n\nWait, let's recheck the coordinates for DOWN. My body segments are: [(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\nMy head is at (9, 8). The cell behind my head is (9, 7). Moving DOWN to (9, 7) means moving into my neck segment. This is an invalid move (suicide).\n\nSafe immediate moves: UP (to eat the apple), LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Goals and Strategy:**\n\nThe closest and most obvious apple is at (9, 9). Moving UP is the best move as it secures an apple, increases my lead, and lengthens my snake.\n\n**3. Check for Enemy Interference/Head-on Collision:**\n\nEnemy Head (0H) is at (6, 2). The enemy is far away from the top right quadrant. I am safe from collision.\n\nWhat are the enemy's possible moves from (6, 2)?\nSafe moves for 0:\n*   UP to (6, 3): Clear.\n*   DOWN to (6, 1): Clear.\n*   LEFT to (5, 2): Collision with body (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 2): Clear (but (7, 2) is somewhat constrained by my body at (7, 4/5/7)).\n\nThe enemy is long (L=13) and needs room. If they move UP to (6, 3), they push into the center. If they move RIGHT to (7, 2), they might try to head towards the (8, 6) apple or move up the right side.\n\nNo matter the enemy's move, my move UP to (9, 9) is safe and high-value.\n\n**4. Select the Best Move:**\n\nMove UP to eat the apple at (9, 9).\n\n**Long-term Strategy (T50+):**\nAfter eating the apple at (9, 9), I will be at (9, 9), length 15. The next closest apples are (7, 9) (two moves away, via (8, 9)) and (8, 6) (3-4 moves away).\n\nFrom (9, 9):\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 9).\n2. Move LEFT to (7, 9) to eat the next apple.\nThis sequence secures two immediate apples in the corner, increasing my length significantly and consolidating control of the top edge.\n\nMove: UP is the current choice.\nUP",

Analyze My Possible Moves from (9, 9):**\n\nMy body segments (head-to-tail): (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5). Wait, my body segments are listed *before* the growth from the apple at (9,9). Since I ate an apple last turn, my previous body segments shifted, and my new body includes the cell I came from (9, 8). The list of body segments provided is *before* the move, but the head is updated.\nLet's assume the provided body list is the body *before* I moved to (9, 9), but since I am calculating the move for Turn 50, the head is already at (9, 9).\n\nMy new body structure (based on the turn 49 move UP from (9, 8) to (9, 9) and eating):\nHead: (9, 9)\nBody: (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5). The tail (7, 5) did not disappear because I ate the apple.\nLength: 15.\n\nCheck immediate fatal collisions from (9, 9):\n*   **UP to (9, 10):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 8):** Into my neck segment. **DEAD**. (My body starts at (9, 8)).\n*   **LEFT to (8, 9):** Clear space. Safe. Also targets apple (7, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 9):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n\nOnly one safe move: LEFT to (8, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate the Safe Move (LEFT to (8, 9)):**\n\nMoving LEFT gets me closer to the apple at (7, 9) (2 steps away if I move LEFT twice).\n(9, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (7, 9) (apple).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Potential Conflicts:**\n\nEnemy Head (0H) is at (7, 2). The enemy is far down and to the left, likely competing for (0, 0), (8, 6), or (0, 9).\nThe enemy's safe moves from (7, 2) are:\n*   UP to (7, 3): Clear.\n*   DOWN to (7, 1): Clear.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 2): Clear.\n*   LEFT to (6, 2): Collision with neck. **DEAD**.\n\nThe enemy is no threat to me in the top right corner.\n\n**4. Alternative Apple Targets:**\nAfter (7, 9), the next closest apples for me are (5, 9) and (8, 6).\n*   If I pursue (7, 9): (9, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (7, 9) (Eat). Then I can pursue (5, 9) via (6, 9) -> (5, 9) (Eat). This secures the top edge.\n*   (8, 6) is also reasonably close, but pursuing the top two apples seems most efficient right now, expanding my territory in the wide open space above 7y.\n\n**5. Determine Final Move:**\n\nSince only LEFT is safe, and it moves me directly toward the next high-priority apple (7, 9), it is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term Strategy (T51+):**\nT50: Move LEFT to (8, 9).\nT51: Move LEFT to (7, 9) and eat apple.\nT52: Move DOWN to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 9) towards the (5, 9) apple. If the space is tight, move down to preserve options. Given the large lead and open space, pursuing (5, 9) is better.\nT53: Move LEFT/DOWN to secure (5, 9).\nThis strategy continues to maximize apple collection while minimizing interaction with the enemy, who is currently stuck in the bottom-middle region.\n\nLEFT",

Length: 13.\nApples: (7, 9), (0, 9), (0, 0), (8, 6), (5, 9).\nScore: Me 14, Enemy 12. I am ahead by 2 apples.\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (8, 9):**\nMy current head is (8, 9).\nMy body segments start at (9, 9) (neck).\n\n*   **UP to (8, 10):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 9):** Apple at (7, 9)! **EAT**.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 9):** Into my neck segment (9, 9). **DEAD**.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (8, 8) and LEFT to (7, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (7, 9):** This is an apple. Eating it is a priority. It increases my length and score. This seems to be the optimal move.\n\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):** This is safe space, but moves away from the immediate apple and doesn't secure the current target. It's a fallback move if LEFT were dangerous, which it is not.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Position and Potential Conflicts:**\n\nEnemy Head (0H) is at (8, 2).\nEnemy's body segments start at (7, 2).\nPossible Enemy Moves from (8, 2):\n*   UP to (8, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (8, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (7, 2): Into neck. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 2): Safe.\n\nThe enemy is far away and poses no immediate threat to me or the (7, 9) apple. If the enemy moves UP, they might target (8, 6). If they move RIGHT or DOWN, they look for open space or (0, 0).\n\n**4. Optimal Move Selection:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 9) allows me to eat an apple, increasing my lead and length. This is clearly the best move.\n\n**Long-term Strategy (T52+):**\nAfter eating the apple at (7, 9), my head will be (7, 9). My length will be 16. The tail will *not* move since I ate an apple. The next closest apples are (5, 9) and (8, 6).\nT52: From (7, 9), I should move towards (5, 9).\nPossible moves from (7, 9) (assuming I just ate):\n*   UP: Dead (off board).\n*   RIGHT to (8, 9): Into my body (the cell I just vacated, which is now part of my longer body). Dead.\n*   DOWN to (7, 8): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (6, 9): Safe, and moves toward (5, 9).\n\nIf (6, 9) is safe, I should go LEFT to (6, 9).\nT53: Move LEFT to (5, 9) and eat the apple.\n\nThis strategy secures the top boundary rapidly.\n\nLEFT",

Yes, moving RIGHT is into the neck, which is a common error to check. The segment immediately behind the head (7, 3) is (8, 3).

Apples: 16.\nEnemy snake (ID 0) head is at H0: (6, 3). Length is 13. Apples: 12.\nApples are at A: (0, 9), (0, 0), (8, 6), (4, 3), (4, 0).\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (5, 9):**\nMy previous move was LEFT from (6, 9). The neck is now (6, 9).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 10):** Off board (y=10). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 9):** Apple at (0, 9). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Moving into my neck segment. **DEAD**.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN (5, 8) and LEFT (4, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Available Apples and Proximity:**\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (0, 9): 5 steps (LEFT).\n2. (8, 6): Manhattan distance |8-5| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps.\n3. (4, 3): 7 steps.\n4. (4, 0): 9 steps.\n5. (0, 0): 14 steps.\n\nThe apple at (0, 9) is the closest and requires moving LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Movement (H0 at (6, 3)):**\nSnake 0's body starts at [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), ...].\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP to (6, 4): Safe. (Very close to A at (4, 3) and possibly A at (8, 6)).\n*   DOWN to (6, 2): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (5, 3): Safe. (Close to A at (4, 3) and A at (4, 0)).\n*   RIGHT to (7, 3): Moving into neck segment (7, 3). **DEAD**.\n\nSnake 0 has three safe moves, and they are centrally located, threatening (4, 3) and (8, 6).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (5, 3) or UP to (6, 4), it is aiming for the center apples. Since (4, 3) is very close to Snake 0, I should assume Snake 0 is aiming for (4, 3), possibly via (5, 3) or (6, 4).\n\n**4. Determine My Move:**\nI want to secure (0, 9). Moving LEFT to (4, 9) directly moves towards this apple.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 9):\n    *   I'm 4 steps away from (0, 9).\n    *   This keeps me safe in the top left corner, away from Snake 0's current location and trajectory.\n    *   My body is long, and moving along the top wall (Y=9) is safe and efficient right now.\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (5, 8):\n    *   This is a vertical movement that slightly takes me away from (0, 9) but potentially closer to (8, 6) if I then move RIGHT, or sets me up for a drop towards the center.\n    *   However, descending into the board could introduce more complexity with my long body, especially since the enemy is in the center-south.\n\nGiven the priority of the uncontested apple at (0, 9), moving LEFT is the superior choice.\n\n**5. Check for Collision Risks:**\nMy proposed move (4, 9) is safe from my own body and the boundaries.\nSnake 0 is far away and won't reach (4, 9) this turn.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure (0, 9). Then evaluate if (0, 0) is reachable before Snake 0, or if (8, 6) or (4, 0) are better targets, depending on where Snake 0 moves. Given my current length (17) and the enemy's length (13), maintaining a safe distance while securing apples seems best.\nI should aim to stay near the top or left walls to avoid getting tangled in the center where Snake 0 is operating.\nIf Snake 0 goes for (4, 3), I collect (0, 9) and then potentially target (8, 6).\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 12.\nApples are at A: (0, 9), (0, 0), (8, 6), (4, 3), (4, 0).\n\nMy last move was LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9). My neck is (5, 9).\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (4, 9):**\n*   **UP to (4, 10):** Off board (y=10). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 8):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 9):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Moving into my neck segment. **DEAD**.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN (4, 8) and LEFT (3, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Available Apples and Proximity:**\nThe apple at (0, 9) is the primary target.\n*   (0, 9): 3 steps away via LEFT.\n*   (4, 3): 6 steps away (3 down, 3 to the side). This is extremely close to Snake 0.\n*   (8, 6): 7 steps away.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Movement (H0 at (5, 3)):**\nSnake 0's neck is (6, 3).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP to (5, 4): Safe. (Moves closer to A at (4, 3)).\n*   DOWN to (5, 2): Safe. (Moves away from (4, 3), but closer to its body/tail and (4, 0)).\n*   LEFT to (4, 3): **APPLE!** Snake 0 would eat the apple at (4, 3).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 3): Moving into neck segment. **DEAD**.\n\nGiven that Snake 0 is at (5, 3) and an apple is at (4, 3), it is almost certain Snake 0 will move LEFT to (4, 3) and eat the apple.\n\n**4. Determine My Move Strategy:**\nSince Snake 0 is likely to get the (4, 3) apple, I must secure (0, 9). Moving LEFT to (3, 9) continues the path towards (0, 9).\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (3, 9):**\n    *   I am 2 steps from (0, 9).\n    *   This is the fastest path to securing an apple, increasing my lead, and maximizing my length advantage.\n    *   It also keeps me safely away from the center action.\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (4, 8):**\n    *   This delays reaching (0, 9) (it would take 4 more steps instead of 2).\n    *   It starts moving me towards the center, which is currently occupied by my very long body and Snake 0. This increases complexity and risk unnecessarily.\n\nThe primary goal is to secure the easy apple at (0, 9) uncontested.\n\n**5. Check for Collision Risks:**\n(3, 9) is safe. No head-on collision risk with Snake 0, as it is several cells away and likely moving to (4, 3).\n\nI will move LEFT now, and then LEFT again, and then LEFT again to secure the apple at (0, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  Move LEFT to (3, 9).\n2.  Move LEFT to (2, 9).\n3.  Move LEFT to (1, 9).\n4.  Move LEFT to (0, 9) to eat the apple.\nAfter securing (0, 9), I will assess my next target. Snake 0 will likely have eaten (4, 3) and will be potentially targeting (4, 0) or (8, 6). The apple at (8, 6) is the most viable secondary target after (0, 9) without excessively crossing the board.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)]\nEnemy length is 14. Apples: 13.\nApples at: (0, 9), (0, 0), (8, 6), (4, 0), (8, 0).\n\nThe target apple (0, 9) is one move away.\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (2, 9):**\n*   **UP to (2, 10):** Off board (y=10). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 8):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 9):** Safe. One step closer to apple (0, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Moving into my neck segment [(3, 9)]. **DEAD**.\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN (2, 8) and LEFT (1, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\nThe closest apple is (0, 9).\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 9), I set myself up to eat (0, 9) next turn. This is the optimal, fastest move to gain an apple and increase my length lead.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 8), I delay eating the apple and potentially give the enemy more time to maneuver towards other apples.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Movement (H0 at (3, 3)):**\nSnake 0's neck is (4, 3).\nPossible safe moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP to (3, 4): Safe. (Towards the center/top half, away from near apples).\n*   DOWN to (3, 2): H0 body segment (3, 2) is the T (3, 2) which is next on its body list. Moving into (3, 2) is moving into its neck segment (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2). Wait, the body list is [(4, 3), (5, 3), ... (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. So (3, 2) is an internal body segment, not the neck. Moving into (3, 2) is a collision. **DEAD**.\n    *   Revisiting Snake 0's body: Head (3, 3). Neck (4, 3). Next segment is (5, 3). The list ends at (3, 0).\n    *   (3, 2) is safe for Snake 0 to move to, as it is an internal body segment, not the neck, and it will free up the tail (3, 0). (The tail moves). Wait, no, only the tail *cell* is freed, not necessarily the tail segment.\n    *   (3, 2) is currently occupied by Snake 0's body. If Snake 0 moves, its tail (3, 0) will move, and all segments shift. Since Snake 0 is not growing, the cell (3, 0) becomes empty.\n    *   A snake cannot move into *any* segment of its current body list unless the snake is growing (eating an apple). Since we don't know if they eat, we assume they don't move into existing body cells.\n    *   Body cells occupied by S0: (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0).\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN to (3, 2), it hits its body. **DEAD**.\n*   LEFT to (2, 3): Safe. (Moves towards the left edge).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 3): Moving into its own neck segment. **DEAD**.\n\nTherefore, Snake 0's safe moves are UP to (3, 4) and LEFT to (2, 3).\n(2, 3) blocks access to the lower left area (where apples (0, 0) and potentially (4, 0) are). (3, 4) seems aimless but keeps options open.\n\nSince Snake 0 is far away and not threatening the (0, 9) apple, I must secure it.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 9). This sets up the capture of (0, 9) next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (1, 9).\n2. Move LEFT to (0, 9) to eat apple A(0, 9).\nAfter eating, I will be at (0, 9). I will then look towards (8, 6) or down towards the bottom apples, depending on S0's position. Priority might shift to controlling the center lanes or clearing the top wall.\n\nLEFT",

My length is 18.\nThe enemy snake (ID 0) is at (1, 3), length 14.\n\nApples are at: (0, 0), (8, 6), (4, 0), (8, 0), (6, 8).\n\n**My Snake (ID 1) Head: (0, 9)**\nBody list: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) Head: (1, 3)**\nBody list: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)]\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (0, 9):**\n\n*   **UP to (0, 10):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 8):** Safe. Leads towards apple (0, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 9):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 9):** Into my neck segment (1, 9). **DEAD**.\n\nOnly one safe move: **DOWN to (0, 8)**.\n\nWait, since I just ate an apple, my tail (5, 5) did not move, and my body grew. However, the 'Right' move (1, 9) is my *new* neck segment. The coordinates provided are:\nHead: (0, 9)\nBody: [(1, 9), (2, 9), ...]\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1, 9) is indeed into my neck. I must not move RIGHT.\n\nMy only safe move is DOWN to (0, 8).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake #0 (H0 at (1, 3)):**\n\nPossible moves for S0 from (1, 3):\n*   **UP to (1, 4):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Into neck. **DEAD**.\n\nThe enemy has three safe moves. Given its proximity to the lower body segments (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), etc., the enemy might try to wrap around or move towards the bottom apples (0, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0).\n\nLikely moves for S0:\nThe enemy is currently boxed in by its own body segments at y=3 and y=2, leaving the column x=1 open for movement UP and DOWN, and x=0 open for movement LEFT.\nIf S0 moves UP to (1, 4), it seems like a move towards more open space.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (0, 3), it moves towards the apple at (0, 0).\n\n**3. Safety Check and Collision Prediction:**\n\nMy move: DOWN to (0, 8).\nThe enemy is far away, primarily operating in the bottom half of the board. No collision risk.\n\n**4. Strategic Goal:**\n\nI am currently at (0, 9). The closest apple is (0, 0) (Manhattan distance 9). The next closest is (8, 6) (distance 11).\nMoving DOWN to (0, 8) keeps me aligned with the (0, 0) apple and prepares me to descend the left edge. Since this is the only safe move, I take it.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\nI need to descend the left side to target the apple at (0, 0). Once I reach the bottom, I will maneuver to get the apples at (4, 0) and (8, 0) before the enemy does, or pivot back up the board if the enemy blocks the bottom access. Since S0 is near the bottom, I need to move quickly.\n\nT60: Move DOWN to (0, 8).\nT61: Move DOWN to (0, 7).\n...\nT68: Move DOWN to (0, 0) and eat the apple.\n\nThis plan seems solid, provided the enemy doesn't rapidly move to the left edge to block me. Given S0's current position (1, 3), it would take at least 5 moves to reach (0, 0) if it moves left then down (LEFT to (0, 3), DOWN to (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)). I need 8 moves to reach the apple. If S0 goes straight for (0, 0), it will get there first.\n\nS0 path to (0, 0): (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (4 moves, if it moves optimal). Wait, my calculation Rationale in step 4 was wrong.\nMy path to (0, 0): 9 - 0 = 9 moves, i.e., (0, 9) to (0, 8) ... to (0, 0) is 9 moves total. Wait, I start at (0, 9). Moving 1 cell requires 1 turn.\n(0, 9) $\\to$ (0, 8) (T59)\n(0, 8) $\\to$ (0, 7) (T60)\n...\n(0, 1) $\\to$ (0, 0) (T67)\nIt takes 9 turns (T59 through T67).\n\nS0 path to (0, 0):\n(1, 3) $\\to$ (0, 3) (T59) (1 move)\n(0, 3) $\\to$ (0, 2) (T60)\n(0, 2) $\\to$ (0, 1) (T61)\n(0, 1) $\\to$ (0, 0) (T62)\nIt takes only 4 moves for S0 if it chooses LEFT then DOWN. S0 will definitely reach (0, 0) much faster than I can. I should switch targets.\n\nNew closest apples: (4, 0) and (8, 0) are about the same distance for S0 (5 moves max).\n(8, 6) is 8 moves away for me (DOWN to (0, 8), RIGHT 8 times).\n(6, 8) is 4 moves away for me (DOWN to (0, 8), RIGHT 6 times, UP 1). No, I start at (0, 9).\n(6, 8) distance: $|6-0| + |8-9| = 6 + 1 = 7$.\nPath: (0, 9) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8). 7 moves total.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the apples:\n1. (0, 0): S0 wins race (4 moves vs 9 moves).\n2. (8, 6): Distance 11.\n3. (4, 0): Distance 13.\n4. (8, 0): Distance 17.\n5. (6, 8): Distance 7. This is the new closest apple. I can reach it fastest.\n\nMy path to (6, 8) if I move DOWN first (since it's the only option):\nT59: (0, 9) $\\to$ (0, 8) [DOWN]\nT60: (0, 8) $\\to$ (1, 8) [RIGHT]\nT61: (1, 8) $\\to$ (2, 8) [RIGHT]\nT62: (2, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8) [RIGHT]\nT63: (3, 8) $\\to$ (4, 8) [RIGHT]\nT64: (4, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8) [RIGHT]\nT65: (5, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8) [RIGHT] (Eat apple)\nTotal 7 turns.\n\nS0 path to (6, 8): (1, 3) $\\to$ (1, 4) $\\to$ (1, 5) $\\to$ (1, 6) $\\to$ (1, 7) $\\to$ (1, 8) $\\to$ (2, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8) $\\to$ (4, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8). 10 moves minimum.\n\nI win the race to (6, 8)!\n\nWait, I must check if S0 might block my path. S0 is far away and doesn't seem likely to block the 8-row path soon.\n\nTherefore, the move is DOWN, as it is the only safe move, and the first step toward the apple at (6, 8).\n\nDOWN",

(Cell (2, 2) is empty, (2, 3) is snake body).\n\nThe enemy has three safe moves: DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2).\n\n**3. Evaluate Immediate Collision Risks (Head-to-Head):**\n\nMy safe moves are (0, 7) and (1, 8).\nS0 is at (1, 2).\n\nNo risk of a direct head-on collision as we are 6 squares apart.\n\n**4. Evaluate Moves based on Strategic Goal (Target: (6, 8)):**\n\nIn the previous turn, I decided to target the apple at (6, 8) because I was in a good position to race S0 for it.\n\nTarget (6, 8).\nCurrent position: (0, 8).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 7):** This moves me 1 step closer to the (0, 0) apple, which S0 is likely to win, but it is also a step perpendicular to the horizontal path to (6, 8). If I continue DOWN, I move away from (6, 8) (Manhattan distance increases from 6 to 7).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 8):** This moves me 1 step closer to (6, 8) (Manhattan distance decreases from 6 to 5). This keeps me aligned on row 8, leading directly to the target.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to continue the planned path towards (6, 8).\n\nPath to (6, 8) if I move RIGHT:\nT60: (0, 8) $\\to$ (1, 8) [RIGHT]\nT61: (1, 8) $\\to$ (2, 8) [RIGHT]\nT62: (2, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8) [RIGHT]\nT63: (3, 8) $\\to$ (4, 8) [RIGHT]\nT64: (4, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8) [RIGHT]\nT65: (5, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8) [RIGHT] (Eat apple)\nTotal 6 moves remaining.\n\n**5. Consider Long-Term Strategy and Traps:**\n\nMoving along row 8 seems safe for the immediate future. The enemy is far down below.\n\nLet's check for potential self-trapping or blocking.\nRow 8 has my body segments at (8, 8) and (9, 8). No, review of body structure:\nHead: (0, 8).\nBody: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), ...]\nIf I move RIGHT along (1, 8), (2, 8), ..., (7, 8), I am in free space until I reach (8, 8) or (9, 8). Wait, (8, 8) is an apple location, no it is (6, 8) and (8, 6). The board diagram shows A at (6, 8).\n\nBoard:\n 9 T T T T T T T T T T\n 8 1 . . . . . A . . T\n 7 . . . . . T T T T T\n\nThe path up to (6, 8) is clear of my body. (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8) are empty. Ah, wait, (9, 8) IS part of my body loop (T at (9, 8)).\nLet's re-verify the body list for segments on row 8:\nHead: (0, 8).\nBody: ..., (9, 9), **(9, 8)**, (9, 7), ...\n\nIf I reach (8, 8), the next spot is (9, 8), which is my body!\n\nPath to (6, 8):\n(0, 8) H\n(1, 8)\n(2, 8)\n(3, 8)\n(4, 8)\n(5, 8)\n(6, 8) Apple (A)\n\nIf I move RIGHT 6 times, I eat the apple at (6, 8). My new head will be (6, 8).\nThe path (1, 8) through (6, 8) is safe. No body segments there.\n\nWhat happens after I eat the apple at (6, 8)? My length increases to 19. My body will now occupy (0, 8) up to (5, 8) and then the rest of the existing segments. My tail remains at (5, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I am fully committed to taking this apple.\n\n**6. Re-evaluating S0's Possibilities:**\n\nS0 will likely move towards the apples at (0, 0), (4, 0), or (8, 0).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (0, 2), it is lining up for (0, 0).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 2), it gives it options for (4, 0) or (8, 0).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (1, 1), it maintains a central south position.\n\nIf S0 goes for (0, 0): (0, 2) $\\to$ (0, 1) $\\to$ (0, 0). It will arrive at T62.\n\nGiven my strong position for (6, 8), moving RIGHT is the best decision.\n\nThe final decision is RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving RIGHT until (6, 8) to secure the apple. After consuming (6, 8), evaluate new closest apples. The top edge is now mostly filled by my body, so I need to find a way down or across the board safely afterwards.\n\nRIGHT",

My snake (ID 1) head is at (1, 8).\nMy body segments are: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 17 (excluding head).\nThe enemy snake (ID 0) head is at (1, 1). Length 13 (excluding head).\n\nApples are at: (0, 0), (8, 6), (4, 0), (8, 0), (6, 8).\n\n**1. Analyze My Possible Moves from (1, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (1, 9):** Into my body segment (1, 9). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 7):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 8):** Into my body segment (0, 8) (neck). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (1, 7) and RIGHT (2, 8).\n\n**2. Analyze the Enemy Snake #0 at (1, 1):**\n\nEnemy body segments near its head: (1, 2), (1, 3).\nPossible moves for S0 from (1, 1):\n*   **UP to (1, 2):** Into neck segment (1, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe. (Appears to be empty, adjacent to apple (4, 0) and (8, 0)).\n*   **LEFT to (0, 1):** Safe. (Clear path to apple (0, 0)).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Safe.\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN (1, 0), LEFT (0, 1), RIGHT (2, 1).\n\n**3. Evaluate Immediate Collision Risks (Head-to-Head):**\n\nNo immediate risk; we are far apart.\n\n**4. Evaluate My Strategy (Target: (6, 8)):**\n\nMy plan was to move along row 8 to secure the apple at (6, 8). I moved RIGHT in the previous turn to (1, 8).\n\nCurrent head: (1, 8). Target: (6, 8). Manhattan distance: 5.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 7):** This moves me off the direct horizontal path. Distance to (6, 8) increases to 5 + 1 = 6 (5 steps right, 1 step up). This is a safe alternative if RIGHT is blocked or undesirable, but sacrifices progress to the target.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 8):** Continues the path towards (6, 8). Distance decreases to 4. This is the optimal move for securing the apple.\n\nIf I continue RIGHT, I should reach (6, 8) in 4 more turns (T65).\n\nThe path (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8) is completely clear of my current body segments and the enemy.\n\n**5. Confirm Enemy Movement and Impact on My Goal:**\n\nS0 is at (1, 1). S0 appears to be moving towards the bottom apples (0, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0). My movement up top is relatively unconcerned by S0's current position.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT (0, 1), it is 1 move from (0, 0).\nIf S0 moves DOWN (1, 0), it is 3 moves from (4, 0).\nS0 is unlikely to interfere with (6, 8) in the next 4 turns.\n\n**6. Conclusion on Move Choice:**\n\nMoving RIGHT maintains the direct and safe route to the targeted apple at (6, 8).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue moving RIGHT (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) to secure the apple. After eating (6, 8), my snake will have a solid presence on the top edge. I need to observe where S0 is at that point and determine the best route to the next apple, likely (8, 6) or (8, 0), while being mindful of my long body spanning the top.\n\nRIGHT",

Segments include: (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), ..., (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7).\n*   Enemy body is in the bottom left/center, primarily along row 3 and row 1/2.

Moves directly towards the apple (6, 8).\n\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 0)):**\n\n*   Enemy's head is on apple (0, 0).\n*   Enemy body segments near head: (0, 1), (1, 1).\n*   Possible moves for S0 from (0, 0):\n    *   UP to (0, 1): Into neck (0, 1). **DEAD**.\n    *   DOWN to (0, -1): Off board. **DEAD**.\n    *   LEFT to (-1, 0): Off board. **DEAD**.\n    *   RIGHT to (1, 0): Safe.\n*   The enemy previously ate the apple at (0, 0). Now the apple is at (4, 0), (8, 0), etc. Let's re-examine the board state and the provided apple list: Apples are at (8, 6), (4, 0), (8, 0), (6, 8), (6, 7).\n*   The board shows '0' at (0, 0), confirming the enemy is there. If the enemy just moved onto an apple, its body length will increase, but the board visual suggests (0, 0) is currently occupied by S0's head, and there is no apple marker there.\n*   Looking back at Turn 62 Rationale: S0 was at (0, 1) and was predicted to move DOWN to (0, 0) to eat an apple. *If* S0 ate an apple there, it is now at (0, 0) and has grown.\n*   Given S0's current position (0, 0), its only safe move is **RIGHT to (1, 0)**. This keeps it near the bottom row where apples (4, 0) and (8, 0) are located.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are far apart. No immediate head-to-head or body collision risk.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\n\nI am only 3 moves away from eating apple (6, 8). Moving RIGHT maintains this direct path.\n\n*   (3, 8) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{RIGHT}}$ (4, 8)\n*   (4, 8) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{RIGHT}}$ (5, 8)\n*   (5, 8) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{RIGHT}}$ (6, 8) (Eat)\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 7) would divert me and require more moves to reach (6, 8) or any other nearby apple. Since the path is clear, I should prioritize the apple.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue moving right towards (6, 8). After acquiring (6, 8), I will have a very long body. The next closest apples are (6, 7) (right next door), (8, 6), and then the ones on the bottom row (4, 0), (8, 0). I will likely aim for (6, 7) or (8, 6) to consolidate control of the upper-right quadrant while S0 is busy in the bottom-left/center.\n\nRIGHT",

(Moves toward apple (4, 0))\n*   The enemy will likely move toward apple (4, 0). The most direct path is RIGHT to (3, 0). Moving UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0) are both safer options than trying to navigate the crowded bottom-left corner. Given the presence of (4, 0) nearby, S0 is likely targeting it. Let's assume S0 targets (4, 0) and moves RIGHT to (3, 0) or UP to (2, 1).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are very far apart. No risk of collision this turn.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\n\nThe path to the apple (6, 8) is RIGHT. This is the optimal move as it scores a point, maintains my lead, and continues consolidating my position in the top-right quadrant.\n\n*   Move: RIGHT to (6, 8) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7), I delay eating the apple and potentially give the enemy time to catch up.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. Eat apple at (6, 8). My head will be at (6, 8), my length 19.\n2. The next closest apples are (6, 7) (down one) and (8, 6) (down two, right two).\n3. I will aim to get (6, 7) next, by moving DOWN to (6, 7). This keeps me centered in the top-right structure I've built.\n4. Enemy 0 is now at (3, 0) or (2, 1) and will likely eat (4, 0) soon. I must keep securing apples quickly.\n\nRIGHT",

It keeps me in a dominant position in the top half of the board.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 8), I miss the immediate opportunity and the apple (6, 7) might become an obstacle later if I need to move back down that column.\n\n**Target Lock:** Move DOWN to (6, 7).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\n1. Eat apple at (6, 7). My head will be at (6, 7), length 20.\n2. The remaining nearby apples are (8, 6) and (8, 0). (2, 1) is also accessible later.\n3. Given my current position, moving towards (8, 6) seems logical, perhaps via (7, 7) then (8, 7) or (7, 6) then (8, 6).\n4. Since the enemy is likely eating (4, 0) now, the next apple they might consider is (2, 1) or (8, 0). (8, 0) is far, but (2, 1) is close.\n5. I should prioritize (8, 6) and then move to secure the right side if possible, or head towards the central column 7/8.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

My tail is at (9, 7).\n\nLet's re-verify the full body configuration for Snake 1:\n(6, 7) H -> (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9) -> (1, 9) -> (2, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (5, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) T\n\nEnemy 0:\n(4, 0) H -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (8, 3) T\n\n**Evaluating My Potential Moves from (6, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** Into my neck segment (6, 8). **DEAD**. (Unless I shrink, which I didn't, as I ate an apple).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. Free space.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe. Free space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe. Free space.\n\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n1. (8, 6): 3 moves away (via (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6) or (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6)).\n2. (4, 5): 4 moves away (via (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5)).\n3. (6, 0): 7 moves away (Straight DOWN).\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 0)):**\n\nThe enemy is massive in the bottom left. They just ate (4, 0).\nThe closest apples for them are:\n1. (2, 1): 2 moves away (UP, LEFT or LEFT, UP).\n2. (6, 0): 2 moves away (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n3. (8, 0): 4 moves away (RIGHT 4).\n4. (4, 5): 5 moves away (UP 5).\n\nThe enemy is bottlenecked by their own body segment (4, 3) and (3, 3) further up, and my body (9, 7) is keeping them confined to the bottom/left corner if they go up.\nIf S0 goes for (6, 0): Moves (4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0).\nIf S0 goes for (2, 1): Moves (4, 0) -> (3, 0) (DEAD) or (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) is 3 moves, or (4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) is complex.\nThe most straightforward path to (2, 1) minimizing length increase: (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1). This is 3 moves.\nThe move RIGHT to (5, 0) or UP to (4, 1) are most likely. UP seems better as it keeps the apple (6, 0) an option while moving toward the board center and (2, 1).\n\nLet's assume Enemy moves UP or RIGHT.\n\n*   Case A: Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 0) (to get (6, 0)).\n*   Case B: Enemy moves UP to (4, 1) (to get (2, 1) or (4, 5)).\n\n**My Strategy:**\n\nI am in a strong strategic position near the right edge and the top half. The apple (8, 6) is the closest. I should secure that one.\n\n1.  Move RIGHT to (7, 7).\n2.  From (7, 7), I can go UP to (7, 8) and then LEFT/DOWN depending on configuration, or DOWN to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 7).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 7):\nNext turn: (7, 7).\nOptions from (7, 7): UP (7, 8) [Safe toward body], RIGHT (8, 7) [Safe], DOWN (7, 6) [Safe toward apple (8, 6)], LEFT (6, 7) [Dangerous, into tail/old spot].\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 6):\nNext turn: (6, 6).\nOptions from (6, 6): UP (6, 7) [Dead into neck], LEFT (5, 6) [Safe], DOWN (6, 5) [Safe], RIGHT (7, 6) [Safe toward apple (8, 6)].\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7):\nNext turn: (5, 7).\nOptions from (5, 7): UP (5, 8) [Dead into body], LEFT (4, 7) [Safe], DOWN (5, 6) [Safe toward apple (4, 5)], RIGHT (6, 7) [Dead into neck].\n\nMoving RIGHT (to (7, 7)) is the most promising path toward (8, 6), giving me two immediate safe future moves (DOWN to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 7)) while minimizing blockage risk.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (to (6, 6)), the approach to (8, 6) is slightly indirect, (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6). This is 2 moves away.\nIf I choose RIGHT (to (7, 7)), the approach to (8, 6) is (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) or (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6). Also 2 moves away.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT opens up the channel along y=7 and gets me closer to my tail location (9, 7) which will vanish soon. It maximizes my control over the right side.\n\nLet's check for enemy interception.\nIf enemy goes UP to (4, 1), they definitely don't interfere with my moves (7, 7) or (6, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 7), I am ready to pursue (8, 6).\n\nStep 1: (6, 7) -> RIGHT -> (7, 7).\nStep 2: (7, 7) -> DOWN -> (7, 6).\nStep 3: (7, 6) -> RIGHT -> (8, 6) (Apple).\n\nThis seems solid and aggressive.\n\nLet's confirm the tail calculation. Since I ate an apple, my tail (9, 7) moves to (9, 8). This is wrong. The tail *stays* at (9, 7) when I eat an apple.\nNo, that's not right. The tail stays ONLY when the snake length increases. If I just moved, the previous tail segment becomes the new body segment, and the true tail location is removed from the board, opening up a space, UNLESS an apple was eaten.\n\nSince I ate an apple at (6, 7) last turn (Turn 66), my length increased. The tail segment (9, 7) *remained* part of the body. My new body is length 20.\nMy body segments are: (6, 8), (5, 8), ..., (9, 8), (9, 7).\nIf I move R to (7, 7), the segment (9, 7) will become free space, unless it is eaten by S0. S0 is far away.\n\nCurrent Head: (6, 7).\nCurrent Tail: (9, 7).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 7):\nNew Head: (7, 7).\nNew Body: (6, 7) ... (9, 8).\nFree space: (9, 7). This will give me more room on the right side if needed.\n\nThe plan stays: move RIGHT towards (8, 6).\n\nRIGHT",
