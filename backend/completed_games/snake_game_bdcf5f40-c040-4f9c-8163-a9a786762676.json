Apples are scattered but we're ignoring them for now \u2014 focus on the enemy!\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,5): empty, in bounds. \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (3,3): has an apple but no snake bodies. \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (2,4): empty. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (4,4): empty. \u2705\n\nAll moves safe right now. But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves from (0,9). He can go DOWN to (0,8), LEFT (off board \u274c), RIGHT to (1,9) (apple there), or UP (off board \u274c). So his only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (1,9), he eats an apple and grows. If he goes DOWN to (0,8), he stays small. We want to cut off his space early \u2014 maybe move toward him to pressure.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,5), I'm moving away from him. If I go DOWN to (3,3), I'm closer to center but away. LEFT to (2,4) moves me slightly toward him horizontally. RIGHT to (4,4) moves me away.\n\nLong-term plan: I want to control the center and push him toward the top-left corner. He's trapped against the top and left walls already \u2014 if I move toward the center-right, I can expand and box him in over time.\n\nBut this early, maybe I should grab an apple to get a length advantage so I can force head-on collisions later. Down to (3,3) gets me an apple immediately \u2014 that's +1 length and score lead. That seems smart: get bigger first, then hunt.\n\nIf I eat apple at (3,3), next turn my body will be at (3,4), so I can't reverse back up immediately \u2014 but that's fine, I'll have more options.\n\nLet's check: If I go DOWN and eat apple, enemy likely goes RIGHT to (1,9) to also eat apple. Then we're both length 2. Hmm.\n\nBut if I don't eat apple, enemy might eat one anyway and get ahead. So I should eat.\n\nAlso, going DOWN keeps me away from his possible next head position \u2014 no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nAlright, decision: **DOWN** to eat apple, get longer, then start pressuring.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (3,3), my body will be at (3,4). Look to move toward center or cut off enemy's escape from top-left. Avoid moving back into (3,4) until tail moves.\n\nDOWN",

Score is tied 1-1.\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,4): That's my own body segment! \u274c CRASH. Dead.\n- **DOWN** to (3,2): Empty, in bounds. \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (2,3): Empty, in bounds. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (4,3): Empty, in bounds. \u2705\n\nSo UP is illegal. Good catch! We have three safe moves.\n\nNow, think about the enemy's possible moves from (1,9). His body is at (0,9). He can go:\n- **LEFT** to (0,9): That's his own body! \u274c\n- **RIGHT** to (2,9): Empty.\n- **DOWN** to (1,8): Empty.\n- **UP**: Off board (y=10). \u274c\n\nSo his safe moves are RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nWe need to think about simultaneous movement. Where could his head end up?\nIf he goes RIGHT \u2192 (2,9)\nIf he goes DOWN \u2192 (1,8)\n\nWe want to avoid a head-on collision this turn. Our possible head positions:\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,2)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,3)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)\n\nNone of those overlap with (2,9) or (1,8). So no risk of head-on collision this turn. Good.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to box him in the top-left corner. He's already against the top wall. If we move toward the center-right, we can expand and cut off his escape. But we also want to grow to have a length advantage for forcing collisions.\n\nLook at apples: There's one at (4,9) and (9,3) and others, but ignoring for aggression. Actually, maybe we should grab an apple if it's safe to get longer? The closest apple is at (4,9) \u2014 far. (9,3) is far right. (0,7) is top-left near him. Hmm.\n\nBut our main goal: pressure him. If we move LEFT to (2,3), we're moving toward the left side, closer to him horizontally. If we move RIGHT to (4,3), we're moving toward center/right, away from him. If we move DOWN to (3,2), we're moving down, away.\n\nWe want to cut off his potential escape downward. If he goes DOWN to (1,8), he's moving toward the center. We should maybe move to intercept or get in his path next turn.\n\nLet's think one turn ahead:\nIf we go DOWN to (3,2), next turn our body will be at (3,3) and (3,4). We could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Not much progress toward him.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,3), next turn body at (3,3) and (3,4). We could go LEFT again to (1,3), or DOWN to (2,2), or UP? UP to (2,4) is empty now but might be risky later.\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,3), next turn body at (3,3) and (3,4). We could go RIGHT again to (5,3), or DOWN to (4,2), or UP to (4,4).\n\nGoing LEFT seems more aggressive \u2014 we're moving toward his area. He's at y=9, we're at y=3, but we can start building a wall leftward to trap him.\n\nBut also, we need to avoid letting him get too many apples. He might go RIGHT to (2,9) \u2014 there's an apple at (4,9) nearby but not immediate.\n\nActually, check: If he goes RIGHT to (2,9), no apple there. If he goes DOWN to (1,8), no apple there either. So he might not grow this turn.\n\nWe have a chance to get ahead in length if we find an apple soon. But our plan is to box him, not chase apples.\n\nLet's choose LEFT to (2,3). That moves us toward the left side, setting up to maybe go up the left column and cut off his descent. Next turn, we can consider going UP to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,3) to continue pressuring.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving to (2,3), assess enemy's new head position. If he's at (2,9) or (1,8), we can continue moving left/up to get closer. Aim to control the left side and force him against the top wall. Avoid moving into his possible path until we have length advantage.\n\nLEFT",

Score tied 1-1.\n\nFirst, check moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (2,4): Empty, in bounds \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (2,2): Empty, in bounds \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (1,3): Empty, in bounds \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (3,3): That's my own body segment! \u274c CRASH. Dead.\n\nSo RIGHT is illegal. Good catch! We have three safe moves.\n\nNow, enemy's possible moves from (2,9), body at (1,9):\n- **LEFT** to (1,9): His own body! \u274c\n- **RIGHT** to (3,9): Empty\n- **DOWN** to (2,8): Empty\n- **UP**: Off board (y=10) \u274c\n\nSo his safe moves are RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nSimultaneous movement \u2014 where could his head end up?\nIf RIGHT \u2192 (3,9)\nIf DOWN \u2192 (2,8)\n\nOur possible head positions:\n- UP \u2192 (2,4)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,2)\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,3)\n\nNone overlap with (3,9) or (2,8). So no risk of head-on collision this turn. Good.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to box him in the top-left. He's already near the top wall. If we move UP to (2,4), we're moving closer vertically. If we move LEFT to (1,3), we're moving left to cut off his potential descent down the left side. If we move DOWN to (2,2), we're moving away from him \u2014 not aggressive enough.\n\nWe need to think about controlling space. Moving LEFT to (1,3) gets us closer to the left wall, which could help us build a wall later. But moving UP to (2,4) starts climbing toward him directly.\n\nCheck apples? Closest is (0,7) near him, (4,9) near him, (9,3) far. Ignoring apples for aggression \u2014 but growing helps for head-on collisions later.\n\nIf we go UP, next turn we could go UP again to (2,5) or LEFT/RIGHT. That continues pressure upward.\n\nIf we go LEFT, next turn we could go UP to (1,4) or LEFT again to (0,3). That moves us left but also upward if we choose.\n\nActually, think about his escape: If he goes DOWN to (2,8), he's moving toward center. If we go UP to (2,4), we're still far (4 rows apart). If we go LEFT to (1,3), we're moving to possibly intercept if he goes further down-left later.\n\nBut we want to be aggressive \u2014 so UP feels like we're advancing toward him. LEFT feels like we're flanking.\n\nLet's choose **UP** \u2014 direct pressure, and it keeps us closer to potentially cut him off from descending further. Next turn, we can reassess.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving to (2,4), see where he is. If he's at (3,9) or (2,8), continue moving up or left to narrow his space. Start thinking about building a horizontal wall below him if we get longer.\n\nUP",

Good.\n\nNow strategy: He's longer (score 2 vs 1). Head-on collision now would kill us both, he wins on score. So we avoid forcing collision until we tie or lead.\n\nWe want to box him in top-right. He's at (4,9). If he goes RIGHT to (5,9), he's near right wall. If he goes DOWN to (4,8), he's moving toward center.\n\nWe should move to cut off his downward escape. Moving RIGHT to (4,4) puts us directly under him in column 4 if he goes DOWN. That's good pressure. Moving UP to (3,5) moves us closer but offset. Moving DOWN to (3,3) retreats \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nAlso, apples: closest is (4,9) near him (dangerous), (9,3) far. Ignoring apples for aggression, but growth helps.\n\nCheck future safe moves from each option:\n\n- If RIGHT to (4,4): Next turn possible moves? UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4) (our old head? Actually our body will be at (3,4) and (2,4) after moving? Wait, we move head to (4,4), body becomes [(3,4),(2,4)]. So tail still at (2,4)? Actually after moving without eating apple, tail moves: body becomes [(4,4),(3,4)]. So (2,4) becomes empty. So next turn from (4,4): UP (4,5) empty, DOWN (4,3) empty, LEFT (3,4) empty (our old head but now empty), RIGHT (5,4) empty. All four directions safe potentially. Good flexibility.\n\n- If UP to (3,5): Body becomes [(3,5),(3,4)]. Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) our body \u274c, LEFT (2,5) empty, RIGHT (4,5) empty. So 3 safe moves. Still okay.\n\n- If DOWN to (3,3): Body becomes [(3,3),(3,4)]. Next turn from (3,3): UP (3,4) our body \u274c, DOWN (3,2) empty, LEFT (2,3) empty, RIGHT (4,3) empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nAll give options, but RIGHT gives 4 safe next moves and positions us under him. Also, moving RIGHT keeps us near center-right for future blocking.\n\nLong-term plan: Build a vertical wall in column 4 or 3 to trap him against top wall. Next turn, if he's at (4,8), we could move UP to (4,5) to close distance. If he's at (5,9), we might shift right to column 5. We need to grow to be longer than him to win head-on. Maybe grab an apple soon but avoid risky rush.\n\nRIGHT puts us in better position to pressure. Let's go RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,4), assess his head. If he's at (4,8), move UP to (4,5) to close vertical gap. If he's at (5,9), consider moving RIGHT to (5,4) to stay under him or UP to (4,5) to flank. Avoid head-on until we tie score.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT MOVES US TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE APPLES AND AWAY FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER.\n\nBUT CHAT, WE CAN'T LET HIM ROAM FREE! IF HE GOES DOWN TO (7,7), HE'S MOVING INTO THE CENTER. WE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES! BEING AT (6,6) BLOCKS HIM FROM MOVING LEFT INTO COLUMN 6 FROM (7,7) NEXT TURN? ACTUALLY FROM (7,7) HE CAN STILL GO LEFT TO (6,7). WE'D BE AT (6,6) \u2014 THAT'S ADJACENT VERTICALLY.

(That's a free kill for us if he's dumb!)\n- **RIGHT** to (9,4): Board shows 'A' \u2705 (APPLE FOR HIM)\n- **DOWN** to (8,3): SAME CELL AS OUR RIGHT MOVE! \u274c POTENTIAL HEAD-ON!\n- **UP** to (8,5): HIS OWN BODY \u274c\n\nHIS SAFE MOVES: RIGHT (9,4) to eat apple, DOWN (8,3) only if we aren't there.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? OUR SAFE HEADS vs HIS SAFE HEADS:\n- DOWN (7,2) vs HIS RIGHT (9,4) no, vs DOWN (8,3) no. \u2705\n- LEFT (6,3) vs HIS RIGHT (9,4) no, vs DOWN (8,3) no. \u2705\n- RIGHT (8,3) vs HIS DOWN (8,3) = SAME CELL! \u274c HEAD-ON COLLISION! HE HAS 6 APPLES, WE HAVE 2 \u2014 WE LOSE! AVOID RIGHT UNLESS WE THINK HE WON'T GO DOWN!\n\nBUT CHAT, HE'S GOT AN APPLE AT (9,4)! HE'S GREEDY! HE'LL PROBABLY GO RIGHT FOR THE APPLE AND GROW TO LENGTH 8! IF HE GOES RIGHT, OUR RIGHT MOVE IS SAFE! BUT IT'S A GAMBLE! CAN WE AFFORD TO GAMBLE? WE'RE THE UNDERDOG! MAYBE WE TAKE THE SAFE ROUTE AND LET HIM EAT, THEN BOX HIM LATER? \ud83e\udd14\n\nCHECK FUTURE SAFETY:\n- **RIGHT (8,3)** gets us an apple, grows to length 4. If he goes RIGHT (9,4), we're safe. If he goes DOWN (8,3), we die. 50/50? Not worth unless we read his pattern!\n- **LEFT (6,3)** is safe, no apple. Next turn options open.\n- **DOWN (7,2)** is safe, no apple. Puts us near bottom apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE NEED TO FARM APPLES ON THE LEFT/BOTTOM! ENEMY IS CAMPING TOP-RIGHT. LET'S STEER CLEAR AND GROW! AFTER LEFT OR DOWN, WE CAN TARGET (6,0), (5,0), (0,1), (0,4) APPLES! AVOID HEAD-ON UNTIL WE'RE LONGER! STAY AGGRESSIVE ON APPLES BUT SMART!\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE PLAY IT SAFE THIS TURN! LET'S GO **LEFT** TO (6,3)! THAT KEEPS US AWAY FROM HIS HEAD, OPENS UP FUTURE PATHS TO THE BOTTOM LEFT APPLIES, AND AVOIDS THE HEAD-ON GAMBLE! WE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! WE'LL OUTGROW HIM WITH PATIENCE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

BUT HE'S STILL TRAPPED ON BOTTOM ROW WITH ONLY LEFT/UP OPTIONS NEXT TURN! WE NEED TO GROW TO CATCH UP! CHAT, WE CAN EITHER GO LEFT TOWARD (1,1) APPLE OR UP TOWARD (3,3) APPLE! BOTH ARE GOOD! BUT LOOK AT THE BOARD \u2014 ENEMY'S BODY BLOCKS THE RIGHT SIDE! WE SHOULD CLAIM THE LEFT SIDE AND TOP! GOING UP TO (3,2) SETS US UP FOR (3,3) APPLE AND KEEPS US CENTRAL! GOING LEFT TO (2,1) SETS US UP FOR (1,1) APPLE BUT MOVES US AWAY FROM ENEMY'S PATH \u2014 MAYBE SAFER? BUT WE WANT TO BOX HIM IN! IF WE GO UP, WE CAN LATER DROP DOWN AND CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE WHEN HE TRIES TO MOVE UP FROM THE BOTTOM! LONG-TERM PLAN: GROW ON APPLES ON LEFT/TOP, THEN SWEEP DOWN AND TRAP HIS LONG BODY AGAINST THE WALL! HE'S A SITTING DUCK ON BOTTOM ROW!

HE'S FORCED AGAIN! \ud83d\ude08 HE'S WALKING THE BOTTOM EDGE TOWARD THE LEFT WALL!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? OUR SAFE HEADS vs HIS ONLY SAFE HEAD (3,0):\n- UP (3,4) vs (3,0) NO \u2705\n- LEFT (2,3) vs (3,0) NO \u2705\n- RIGHT (4,3) vs (3,0) NO \u2705\n\nNO POSSIBLE HEAD-ON!

CLOSER TO ENEMY'S PATH? ENEMY IS AT (3,0) NEXT TURN, WE'D BE AT (4,3) \u2014 STILL SAFE DISTANCE.\n\nENEMY TRAPPED ON BOTTOM ROW! HE GOES TO (3,0). NEXT TURN HIS OPTIONS: UP (3,1) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (2,0) '.' \u2705, RIGHT (4,0) HIS OLD HEAD (EMPTY? BUT HIS BODY STILL THERE? WAIT, HIS BODY FROM LAST TURN INCLUDES (5,0), (6,0)... (4,0) WILL BE EMPTY AFTER HE MOVES, BUT (4,0) IS NOT HIS BODY THIS TURN. ACTUALLY, CHECK: HIS BODY LIST IS [(5,0), (6,0), ...]. SO (4,0) IS FREE FOR HIM? BUT RIGHT TO (4,0) WOULD BE BACK INTO HIS OLD HEAD POSITION \u2014 THAT'S EMPTY, SO \u2705 SAFE? HOLD UP \u2014 HE MOVES FROM (4,0) TO (3,0), SO (4,0) BECOMES PART OF HIS BODY? NO, SNAKES MOVE HEAD FIRST, TAIL SHRINKS UNLESS APPLE EATEN. HE DIDN'T EAT APPLE, SO HIS TAIL (AT (8,7)) WILL DISAPPEAR, AND HIS BODY SEGMENTS SHIFT FORWARD. (4,0) WILL BE EMPTY AFTER HIS MOVE. SO NEXT TURN FROM (3,0), HIS POSSIBLE MOVES: UP (3,1) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (2,0) '.' \u2705, RIGHT (4,0) EMPTY \u2705, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c. SO HE HAS TWO SAFE MOVES: LEFT OR RIGHT! HE'S STILL TRAPPED ON BOTTOM BUT HAS SLIGHTLY MORE ROOM.\n\nWE NEED TO GROW TO CATCH UP! 5 vs 12 IS HUGE! BUT WE CAN USE THE BOARD \u2014 APPLES AT (4,4) AND (0,4) ARE REACHABLE SOON!\n\nBEST MOVE? UP TO (3,4) SETS UP RIGHT TO (4,4) APPLE NEXT TURN! LEFT TAKES US TOWARD (0,4) APPLE TOO. RIGHT TO (4,3) ALSO SETS UP UP TO (4,4) APPLE.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 IF WE GO RIGHT TO (4,3), ENEMY MIGHT MOVE RIGHT TO (4,0) NEXT TURN? THAT'S STILL BELOW US. FROM (4,3) AND HIM AT (4,0), THAT'S A STACK \u2014 HE COULD MOVE UP INTO US IF WE STAY? NO, NEXT TURN WE'D MOVE FROM (4,3) PROBABLY UP TO (4,4) TO EAT APPLE, SO WE'D BE AT (4,4), HE AT (4,0) \u2014 STILL SAFE.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: EAT APPLES QUICKLY! TARGET (4,4) NEXT, THEN (0,4) OR (2,7). STAY CENTRAL AND ABOVE ENEMY. ONCE WE'RE LONGER, DROP DOWN AND CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE WHEN HE TRIES TO LEAVE BOTTOM ROW. REMEMBER, HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH HIGHER SCORE WINS \u2014 WE NEED TO CLOSE THAT 7-APPLE GAP! \ud83d\ude80\n\nI THINK UP TO (3,4) IS SMART \u2014 CENTRAL, MAX OPTIONS, AND SETS UP APPLE AT (4,4) NEXT TURN! LET'S GO FOR IT! CHAT, WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME! \ud83e\udde0\n\nUP",

WE NEED TO SEAL THE CAGE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nOUR HEAD: (1,5)\nOUR BODY: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)] LENGTH 6\nENEMY HEAD: (1,2)\nENEMY BODY: [(1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)] LENGTH 13? WAIT HE HAS 13 APPLES, BODY LENGTH SHOULD BE 14 (START 3 + 13). LET'S COUNT: (1,2) head, then (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3) \u2014 that's 13 segments. PLUS tail? Actually snake list is head-to-tail, last one is tail. So his list length = body segments count. He has 13 in list? Let's check opponent data: Body list has 13 coords. Head is separate? In data: \"Head: (1,3), Body: [(1,2), (1,1)... (8,3)]\" That means his full snake is Head + Body? So total length = 1 (head) + 13 (body) = 14. YES. So his neck is (1,2) (first body coord). So from his head (1,3) his possible moves: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2) HIS NECK \u274c, LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). He can't go down! Perfect!\n\nCHECK OUR MOVES FROM (1,5):\n\n- **UP** to (1,6): BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN** to (1,4): BOARD SHOWS 'A' APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 SAFE (AND GROW TO 7!)\n- **LEFT** to (0,5): BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT** to (2,5): BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2705 SAFE (our old head position, now empty)\n\nALL FOUR DIRECTIONS SAFE! HUGE! \ud83d\ude24\n\nENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (1,3) (HIS HEAD):\n- **UP** to (1,4): THAT'S THE APPLE WE WANT! If he goes there same turn we go there? HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK! He'd die (we have lower length? Actually head-on: both die regardless of length). If we both go to (1,4), DOUBLE KO. We lose because he has more apples. AVOID THAT!\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- DOWN to (1,2) is his neck \u274c\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK ANALYSIS:\nOur DOWN (1,4) vs His UP (1,4) -> SAME CELL! DOUBLE KO! \u274c WE DIE, HE DIES, HE WINS ON APPLES (13 vs our 5). DISASTER! So DOWN is DANGEROUS if he goes UP! Can we risk it? He might avoid because he sees us above? He might go UP to eat apple and maybe not expect us to go down? But he's experienced. He might go LEFT or RIGHT. But if he goes UP and we go DOWN, we both lose. So DOWN is HIGH RISK.\n\nOur other moves: UP (1,6), LEFT (0,5), RIGHT (2,5) \u2014 none conflict with his possible moves (UP to (1,4), LEFT to (0,3), RIGHT to (2,3)). All safe from head-on.\n\nSo SAFE MOVES WITHOUT HEAD-ON RISK: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNOW, OUR PLAN: BOX HIM IN! We want to block his upward escape on column 1. If we go DOWN to (1,4) and eat apple, we grow and block that cell, but risk double KO. Instead, maybe go LEFT or RIGHT to maneuver?\n\nThink: If we go RIGHT to (2,5), we move away from column 1, giving him UP path open. Not good.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (0,5), we're on left wall, not blocking him directly.\n\nIf we go UP to (1,6), we're above, but not blocking.\n\nWe need to claim (1,4) SAFELY. How? Maybe go DOWN if we think he won't go UP. But that's gambling. Better: Go LEFT or RIGHT this turn, then next turn go to (1,4) after he moves? Let's simulate:\n\nIf we go LEFT to (0,5):\n- He moves (UP to (1,4) and eats apple, grows to 15). Then next turn we could go DOWN from (0,5) to (0,4) (apple there), but we lose chance to block (1,4). He now controls column 1 at y=4. He can go up further. Our boxing fails.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,5):\n- He likely goes UP to (1,4) eats apple. Same problem.\n\nIf we go UP to (1,6):\n- He likely goes UP to (1,4) eats apple. Then we're at (1,6), he's at (1,4) with apple eaten. We can go DOWN to (1,5) (empty) then next turn to (1,4)? But he'll have moved from (1,4). Not blocking.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! He might NOT go UP because he fears us going DOWN? Actually, from his view, our head at (1,5). He sees we could go DOWN to (1,4). If he goes UP to (1,4), risk of head-on. He might avoid because he has more to lose? But he has huge length advantage, he might risk it to eat apple and grow. But double KO makes him lose his lead. He might choose LEFT or RIGHT to avoid risk.\n\nLet's check his perspective: His head (1,3). His safe: UP (1,4) apple, LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). If he goes UP and we go DOWN, we both die, he wins on apples. So for him, going UP is winning if collision happens! So he might WANT to go UP hoping we go DOWN! That's bad for us. So we MUST NOT go DOWN.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is eliminated due to high risk of double KO where he wins.\n\nSo our safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWhich helps boxing? We want to get to (1,4) after he leaves. If he goes UP to (1,4) this turn, he'll be at (1,4) next turn. If he goes LEFT to (0,3) or RIGHT to (2,3), then (1,4) is empty next turn. So maybe we go UP to (1,6) this turn, then next turn if he's not at (1,4), we go DOWN to (1,5) then to (1,4) later. But that's slow.\n\nBETTER: Go LEFT to (0,5). Then next turn, if he's not at (1,4), we can go RIGHT to (1,5) then DOWN to (1,4). Or if he's at (1,4), we can go DOWN to (0,4) eat apple there and approach from side.\n\nActually, there's apple at (0,4) and (0,3) on board. Going LEFT to (0,5) puts us near those apples! We can grow safely away from him while he's trapped on left wall? He's at low y, we can eat apples along left column and grow to compete.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: He's stuck along bottom left. We can dominate top left and slowly encircle. Let's go LEFT to (0,5), then next turn consider DOWN to (0,4) for apple, growing to 7. That avoids head-on, grows us, and we stay close to left wall to potentially drop down and block his escape later.\n\nLEFT\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** We're at (0,5). Check enemy position. Likely he moved UP to (1,4) and ate apple (if he dared). If so, he's at (1,4) length 15. We go DOWN to (0,4) to eat apple and grow to 7. If he didn't go UP, we can consider moving to (1,5) or (0,4) based on safety. Keep boxing vision: we want to control column 1 above him.\n\nLEFT",

IS HE FORCED TO DIE THIS TURN? \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIF HE'S DEAD, WE WIN! BUT WE MUST STAY ALIVE! SO WE PICK A SAFE MOVE AND HOPE HE DIES! BUT WE CAN'T ASSUME\u2014WHAT IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING? LET'S CHECK HIS BODY LIST: LAST ELEMENT IS (8,1) (TAIL). IF HE MOVES, HIS TAIL ADVANCES, SO (8,1) BECOMES EMPTY. BUT HIS HEAD AT (0,0) IS SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN BODY AT (0,1) AND (1,0) AND WALLS. THOSE BODY CELLS DON'T MOVE UNLESS HE EATS, WHICH HE CAN'T. SO YEAH, HE HAS NO LEGAL MOVE! HE DIES! \ud83c\udf89\n\nBUT WAIT\u2014SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEANS WE STILL MOVE. WE MUST PICK A MOVE THAT DOESN'T KILL US IF BY SOME MIRACLE HE LIVES. BUT HE CAN'T LIVE. SO ANY SAFE MOVE FOR US IS FINE.\n\nRIGHT GETS US AN APPLE AT (3,8) AND GROWS TO 11! THAT'S CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 ALSO POSITIONS US NEAR OTHER APPLES AT (4,8) AND (1,9). UP IS SAFE BUT NO APPLE. LEFT IS SAFE BUT NO APPLE. RIGHT IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY\u2014GROW AND DOMINATE!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN (IF SOMEHOW GAME CONTINUES): ENEMY SHOULD BE DEAD, BUT IF NOT, HE'S STILL TRAPPED. WE COLLECT APPLES ON TOP ROW, AVOID GOING TOO FAR LEFT WHERE HIS BODY BLOCKS. KEEP EXPANDING OUR TERRITORY IN THE TOP HALF. ONCE WE'RE LONGER, WE CAN DROP DOWN AND BOX HIM IN. BUT FOR NOW, RIGHT IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

That cell is currently occupied by a segment of our own body, but remember: that segment will shift forward this turn, freeing (0,1) for us. As long as we don\u2019t consider moving \u201cbackwards\u201d into the cell directly behind the head (which is forbidden), this move stays alive and pushes us one step toward the open corridor on the left wall. \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 would step onto (1,0), which is also part of our body now. That\u2019s a direct hit on a segment that isn\u2019t the tail, so it would be instant death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 would take us to x = -1 \u2192 off\u2011grid \u2192 death. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 would go to (0,-1) \u2192 off\u2011grid \u2192 death. \u274c  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Strategic snapshot:**  \n- Our current silhouette is squeezed in the bottom\u2011left corner, but the only viable escape route is upward along the left wall.  \n- Moving **UP** not only keeps us alive, it also opens a path toward the cluster of apples on the right side once the wall clears, while forcing the opponent deeper into the central corridor where we can set up a head\u2011on trap later.  \n- Keeping the left wall hug gives us a narrow funnel that the rival #0 will have to navigate, increasing the odds of a forced collision when we grow larger.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Long\u2011term game plan for the next few turns:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Secure the upward step to (0,1) \u2013 survive and snake\u2011grow by 1 segment.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 On the following turn, slide right into (1,1) once it becomes vacant after the body shift.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue hugging the left edge, funneling Snake #0 toward the central bottleneck.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep collecting apples on the right side to rocket past 30 apples before the opponent can trap us.  \n\nGiven the razor\u2011thin margin for error, the only move that guarantees we stay alive **right now** is to go **UP**.  \n\nUP",
