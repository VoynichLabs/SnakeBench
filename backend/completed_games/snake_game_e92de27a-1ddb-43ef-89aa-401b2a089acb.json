Collecting the apple at (5, 7) after (6, 0) would set me up well to cover more of the base of the board and potentially steer towards the apple at (3, 2) next.\n\nIt's crucial to maintain awareness of Snake #0 because even though it's distant, unpredictable behavior could block an apple.

Is there another apple up or two over where the wall meets the y=10 row? Wait, you are adding a count! Your current move indicates the wall is two squares right of and down one over where I expected the apple. If you hadn't moved, I would suggest staying where you are and running two spaces to the right. That way, at least the plausible wall diagonal apple is confirmed and my guess is only slightly off.
