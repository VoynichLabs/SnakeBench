Looking at the remaining apples:\n\n1. Apple at (0, 7): Same y-level, 6 moves left. This would be a straight horizontal path.\n2. Apple at (9, 8): Close by, 3 right + 1 up. But this is getting closer to the enemy snake's general area.\n\nI think the apple at (0, 7) is a good target since it's on the same horizontal level. I can move LEFT to start heading toward it. The path would be clear and safe.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9, 8) is closer in terms of total moves needed, but I'd be moving toward the right side where the enemy snake is positioned.\n\nI think I'll go for the apple at (0, 7) first since it's a safe, predictable path. Moving LEFT to (5, 7) starts me on that journey.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving LEFT toward the apple at (0, 7), while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nLEFT"
