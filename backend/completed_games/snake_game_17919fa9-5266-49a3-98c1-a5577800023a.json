Body is empty (no segments).\n2. **Obstacles**:\n   - Enemy head at (3,8). If we move into (3,4), (4,4), (7,3), or (7,5), we risk collision.\n   - Board boundaries: Moving left from x=0 or up from y=9 would kill us.\n   - Self-collision: Moving backward (down from y=4) would hit our own tail (none yet, but future risk).\n\n**Safe moves**:\n- UP: (7,5) → Check if (7,5) is occupied by enemy or boundary. Board shows (7,5) is empty (no snake/body). Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,3) → Check if (7,3) is occupied. Board shows (7,3) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,4) → Check if (6,4) is occupied. Board shows (6,4) is empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,4) → Check if (8,4) is occupied. Board shows (8,4) is empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy\n1. **Apples**:\n   - (4,5): Distance to (7,4) is 3 steps diagonally (not optimal).\n   - (6,1): Distance is 5 steps (too far).\n   - (2,2): Distance is 5 steps (too far).\n   - (9,4): Distance is 1 step right (best option).\n   - (5,3): Distance is 2 steps (diagonal).\n\n2. **Prioritization**:\n   - **RIGHT (8,4)**: Directly adjacent to apple at (9,4). Highest immediate reward.\n   - **DOWN (7,3)**: Leads to (5,3) in 2 steps, but requires moving away from enemy head (3,8) which is safe.\n   - **UP (7,5)**: Leads to (5,5) or (4,5) in 2 steps, but (5,5) is closer to enemy head (3,8) if it moves.\n   - **LEFT (6,4)**: Leads to (4,4) or (3,4) in 2 steps, but (3,4) is near enemy head (3,8).\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- Moving RIGHT is safest and most direct. Enemy head at (3,8) won’t interfere with this move.\n- Moving DOWN is also safe but requires more steps to reach (5,3).\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n1. **Short-term**: Move RIGHT to (8,4) and eat apple at (9,4) immediately.\n2. **Mid-term**: After eating, grow and position to avoid enemy head (3,8) while keeping options open.\n3. **Long-term**: Monitor enemy head and apple positions to avoid collisions and maximize growth.\n\n### Final Decision\n**RIGHT**\n\n---\n**Long-term note for future self**:\n- Track enemy head movement (Snake #0 at (3,8)) and avoid paths that lead to it.\n- Prioritize apples closest to current head position.\n- If enemy grows, adjust strategy to avoid collisions.\n- Avoid moving into cells where enemy could move into your body in future turns.",

From (4,5), both DOWN then RIGHT or RIGHT then DOWN can reach it in a couple of moves. LEFT would move away from that target.\n- Enemies: one enemy head at (8,3). None of the safe moves create an immediate head-on collision this turn.\n\nRationale:\n- DOWN keeps you in a central, open area and moves you closer to the nearest apple (5,3) in a straightforward path over the next couple of turns, while preserving flexibility to react to enemy movement.\n- RIGHT also keeps options open but edges you further east near the enemy, which could be riskier. LEFT diverts from the nearest apple line and is less optimal for rapid apple gain.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Progress toward apple at (5,3) with a two-step approach (preferably DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN), while avoiding traps and watching the enemy’s moves. If the apple at (5,3) is eaten, shift focus to other available apples (e.g., (9,4) or (3,0)) depending on safety and space.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk, but its body is expanding toward (6,4) next turn if it moves right.\n\n#### **Safe Moves from (7,1):**\n1. **UP:** (6,1) – **Apple at (6,1)!** Eating this would give +1 apple and grow the snake.\n2. **DOWN:** (8,1) – Safe, no apple nearby.\n3. **LEFT:** (6,1) – Same as UP (same cell, but snake moves head first).\n4. **RIGHT:** (7,2) – Safe, no apple nearby.\n\n#### **Apple Proximity & Immediate Gain:**\n- The apple at **(6,1)** is directly in front of the head if moving **UP** or **LEFT**. Since the snake moves head-first, **UP** is the correct direction to eat it.\n- Moving **UP to (6,1)** is the best immediate move—it collects the apple and grows the snake.\n\n#### **Threats & Collision Checks:**\n- **Self-collision:** No body segments yet, so no risk.\n- **Enemy collision:** Snake #0’s body is at (5,5) and (6,5). Moving to (6,1) is safe; no overlap.\n- **Post-collection:** After eating (6,1), the new head will be at (6,1), and the tail will shift to (7,1). The snake will now have a body segment at (7,1), so future moves must avoid (7,1) and (6,1) (since the tail is now at (7,1)).\n\n#### **Rationale:**\n- **UP to (6,1)** is the optimal move because:\n  - It directly collects the closest apple, increasing score and snake length.\n  - No immediate collision risk (enemy is far, and no self-collision).\n  - Avoids moving away from the apple (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT are further or redundant).\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Immediate:** Eat (6,1) via **UP** to grow and gain 1 apple.\n2. **Post-Capture:** After eating (6,1), prioritize moves that avoid the new tail position (7,1). The next apple to target is likely **(2,2)** or **(9,4)**, depending on enemy positioning.\n3. **Monitor:** If Snake #0 expands toward (6,4), prioritize vertical moves (UP/DOWN) to avoid collisions.\n4. **Next Apple:** If (6,1) is eaten, prioritize (2,2) or (9,4) based on proximity and enemy threats.\n\n---\n**Final move: UP**",
