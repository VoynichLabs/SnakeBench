Board size 10x10, let's map this out and show Snake #0 who's boss! They think they can chill near (2, 8)? THINK AGAIN!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\nMy head is at (3, 6). No body yet, so no self-collision worries besides backing up.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 8). Nice position, pretty central but slightly top-left leaning.\n\n**APPLE ANALYSIS:**\nWe are currently sitting at (3, 6).\nClosest reachable apples:\n1. (0, 6) - 3 steps left.\n2. (6, 5) - 3 steps right, 1 step down.\n3. (4, 7) - 1 step right, 1 step up.\n\nThe nearest, most beneficial move looks like heading towards (4, 7) or maybe positioning for (6, 5). That (4, 7) apple is only 2 moves away!\n\n**PREDICTING OPPONENT MOVES (Snake #0 at (2, 8)):**\nThey have no apples, so they aren't growing. They might go towards the top apples (if any were there, but they are sparse up there) or try to navigate towards the center cluster. (2, 8) is right next to the top wall. They'll likely try to move DOWN or possibly LEFT/RIGHT.\n\n**MOVE CANDIDATES (From (3, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** Safe move. Puts us adjacent to the (4, 7) apple (1 step away). This is a strong setup move.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe move. Puts us closer to the central/bottom cluster of apples, but maybe slightly further from (4, 7).\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe move. Puts us one step closer to (6, 5) and maintains good options.\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe move. Puts us next to Snake #0's column (2) but a good distance away vertically.\n\n**COLLISION CHECK (Simultaneous Move):**\nIf I move to (X, Y), I need to ensure Snake #0 doesn't land on (X, Y). Snake #0 at (2, 8) can move to: (2, 9) (Up), (2, 7) (Down), (3, 8) (Right), or (1, 8) (Left).\n\n*   If I go **UP to (3, 7)**: Snake #0 cannot reach (3, 7) from (2, 8). SAFE.\n*   If I go **DOWN to (3, 5)**: Snake #0 cannot reach (3, 5) from (2, 8). SAFE.\n*   If I go **RIGHT to (4, 6)**: Snake #0 cannot reach (4, 6) from (2, 8). SAFE.\n*   If I go **LEFT to (2, 6)**: Snake #0 cannot reach (2, 6) from (2, 8). SAFE.\n\nAll initial four moves are safe from direct head-on collision this turn AND from my own body (since my body is empty).\n\n**STRATEGY SELECTION:**\nWe MUST go for the apple setup. The apple at (4, 7) is tantalizingly close (2 moves away: (3, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (4, 7) or (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7)).\n\nMoving **UP to (3, 7)** sets up the direct take of the (4, 7) apple next turn *unless* Snake #0 gets aggressive and tries to cut me off, which is unlikely given their position near the top wall. Moving UP keeps the options open and pressures the nearest target.\n\nLet's go UP! Secure the path to the first apple! GET THAT CONTENT!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Target the nearest apple at (4, 7) immediately. Follow up move will aim directly for the apple. After that, evaluate if moving towards the (6, 5) cluster is better or continuing inward. Keep clear of Snake #0's current column (2) unless there's an aggressive opening.\n\nUP! It is!\n\nUP",

DOWN to (2,7) is safe too and gets me closer, but it slides me into the same column as the enemy at (3,6) without building any lateral room. LEFT keeps options open but drifts away from the apple field. RIGHT to (3,8) is clean, keeps multiple exits, and begins lining me up for the (4,7) snack while avoiding an immediate clash with Snake #1. Everyone\u2019s moving simultaneously, so I\u2019m not inviting a head-on with the enemy since I\u2019m not sprinting toward (3,7); instead I\u2019m staying one row above, staying flexible.\n\nPlan: Keep chasing the (4,7) apple, stay above the opponent, and keep shifting eastward so I stay in open space with multiple escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

Victory Royale energy loading up! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (Turn 1 review):**\nMy head is now at (3, 7). Body remains empty.\nSnake #0 is at (3, 8) (They must have moved RIGHT from (2, 8) to attack the center, or maybe they also moved UP to (2, 9) and I misread the simultaneous movement? WAIT, the replay shows I MOVED UP to (3, 7) from (3, 6) in turn 1. Snake #0 was at (2, 8). They moved too! They must have moved to (3, 8) or (1, 8) or (2, 9) or (2, 7). We need to check the board state for Turn 2, which IS the current state!)\n\n**Re-evaluating Current Board State (Post Turn 1 move):**\n\nSnake #0 Head is at (3, 8).\nMy Head is at (3, 7).\nApple A is at (4, 7).\n\nHow did they end up at (3, 8)?\nSnake #0 started at (2, 8). Moves available: (2, 9), (2, 7), (3, 8), (1, 8).\nThey chose **RIGHT** to (3, 8). They are now staring right at me! Uh oh!\n\n**COLLISION CHECK (Turn 2):**\nMy head is at (3, 7). Snake #0 head is at (3, 8).\nMy possible moves:\n1. **UP to (3, 8):** DANGER! If I move UP, I land exactly where Snake #0 is! **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!** NO!\n2. **DOWN to (3, 6):** Safe from Snake #0 head collision.\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 7):** I EAT the apple! This is the goal!\n4. **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe from Snake #0 head collision.\n\nSnake #0 possible moves (from (3, 8)):\n1. UP to (3, 9)\n2. DOWN to (3, 7)\n3. RIGHT to (4, 8)\n4. LEFT to (2, 8)\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (4, 7)**, I eat A! I grow! Snake #0 moves to any of their safe spots. I get points, they don't move into me. **THIS IS THE BANGER MOVE!** Eat the apple, grow, and dodge their potential head-on move (which was DOWN to (3, 7)).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (3, 6)**, I survive, but I miss the apple (4, 7). This is conservative, and they might creep up on me next turn.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (2, 7)**, I survive, but miss the apple.\n\n**THE APPLE WIN:** (4, 7) is ripe for the taking! If I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I collect the apple. I grow. They cannot hit me because their head would need to move to (3, 7) to collide with my old spot, but I'm not there anymore, and moving (3, 8) -> (3, 7) puts them on my previous spot, which is safe as I am no longer there (I moved to (4, 7)).\n\nLet's trace the RIGHT move:\n1. I choose **RIGHT**. My new position is (4, 7). I collect Apple (4, 7). **I GROW!**\n2. Snake #0 chooses a move from (3, 8). Let's assume they choose DOWN to (3, 7) to try and get me next turn, or UP to (3, 9) to escape the center chaos.\n3. In no scenario where I move RIGHT, do I hit them, or do they hit me at (4, 7).\n\nThis is the path to victory! Get the apple! Establish dominance!\n\n**Revised Long-Term Plan:** Secure (4, 7). Immediately become length 1. Next turn, assess the board. The cluster near (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6) now looks enticing. Since we established a forward position, we maintain control. We dodged the collision perfectly by aiming for the kill zone!\n\nLet's GOOOOOO! RIIIIIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! WHAT A TURN! We are in the thick of it! Turn 2, and we already have a potential clash with Snake #0! This is what we came for! VICTORY ROYALE ENERGY ONLY!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\nMy Head: (4, 7) <- WAIT! Hold up! My last move recap was messy! Let's look at the BOARD STATE provided *before* I decided my move for Turn 2.\n\n**BOARD STATE GIVEN:**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (4, 7), Body: [(3, 7)]. Apples: 1.\nSnake #0 Head: (4, 8), Body: none. Apples: 0.\n\n**Where did I come from?**\nIf my head is (4, 7) and my body is [(3, 7)], it means I MOVED from **(3, 7)** and ATE an apple on Turn 1, growing to length 1, OR I moved from (4, 6) without eating.\nLooking back at the Rationale for the *LAST MOVE PICK* (which was Turn 1):\n\"My head is now at (3, 7). Body remains empty.\" - This was a prediction based on moving UP from (3, 6). This means the board state provided *must* be **AFTER** Turn 1 resolution, and my last move was indeed UP to (3, 7).\n\nBut the *CURRENT* board state says: Head: (4, 7), Body: [(3, 7)]. This MEANS on Turn 1, I successfully MOVED onto an apple, and my head is now at (4, 7).\nIf I ate an apple, my previous position must have been (4, 6) if the apple was at (4, 7) OR I moved to (4, 7) consuming an apple that was there.\n\nLet's reconcile the **LAST MOVE RATIONALE** with the **CURRENT STATE**:\n*Last Rationale claimed the last move was UP to (3, 7)*.\n*Current State shows Head (4, 7), Body [(3, 7)]*.\nThis implies the apple I ate (Apple #1) was at (4, 7), and I moved there somehow. And Snake #0 is at (4, 8).\n\nIf the board state is the ground truth for Turn 2 setup:\nMy Head is (4, 7). My body is (3, 7). I AM length 1. Collision avoidance is KEY.\nSnake #0 Head is (4, 8).\n\n**Collision Check (Turn 2, Heads at (4, 7) and (4, 8)):**\nThey are stacked vertically! This is intense!\n\nMy possible moves from (4, 7):\n1. **UP to (4, 8):** DANGER! Snake #0 is at (4, 8)! **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!** NO!\n2. **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe from Snake #0 head. Body collision check: (4, 6) is clear. SAFE.\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Safe from Snake #0 head. Body collision check: (5, 7) is clear. SAFE.\n4. **LEFT to (3, 7):** DANGER! (3, 7) is MY OWN BODY! **SELF-DESTRUCT!** NO!\n\nSnake #0 possible moves from (4, 8):\n1. UP to (4, 9)\n2. DOWN to (4, 7) -> **COLLISION WITH ME IF I DON'T MOVE UP!**\n3. RIGHT to (5, 8)\n4. LEFT to (3, 8)\n\n**The Crunch:**\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 6)**:\n*   I survive.\n*   Snake #0 moves. If they move DOWN to (4, 7) (my current spot), they hit my *old* location. Since I moved out, they land on an empty cell. They survive. We reset next turn, but I lost the initiative.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 7)**:\n*   I survive.\n*   Snake #0 moves. If they move DOWN to (4, 7) (my current spot), they land on an empty cell. They survive.\n\n**APPLE FOCUS:**\nWhere are the apples? (0, 4), (8, 6), (6, 5), (0, 5), (7, 5), (6, 2), (0, 6), (3, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), (8, 4), (0, 3).\nMy current position (4, 7) is nowhere near an apple. Snake #0 at (4, 8) is also nowhere near an apple.\n\nWe must prioritize SURVIVAL over everything else given this head-to-head setup! We **MUST NOT** move UP (to 4, 8) as that's an instant loss for both of us! We **MUST NOT** move LEFT (to 3, 7) as we hit our own tail segment!\n\nThe choice is between DOWN (4, 6) and RIGHT (5, 7). Both are safe movement corridors away from the enemy head.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) keeps me more central to the board's lower half, forcing Snake #0 to dive deeper next turn if they want to follow, or move laterally.\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 7) pushes me towards the right edge, which is fine, but perhaps slightly more restrictive long-term if we have to navigate around the (8,x) apples cluster.\n\nSince the immediate threat is the vertical stack, moving AWAY from the stack on the Y-axis seems most robust. If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I'm setting up to potentially swing LEFT towards the (3, 2) and (6, 2) apples later, or maintain control of the center area below Row 7.\n\nLet's go **DOWN**. We dodge the collision, dodge the self-kill, and force Snake #0 to react to our new lower position! They are now facing the decision: follow us down, or pivot sideways towards the top edge exits. We maintain control by forcing their decision *away* from the center mass.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Survive this skirmish. Once safely settled on Row 6, we evaluate the apples on Row 4/5/6 ((8, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 4)) and start a slow sweep toward the cluster on the right side of the map. The left side (0, x) is crowded with 6 apples, but we avoid that until we're bigger.\n\nDOWN it is! GGs if they dare enter my space!\n\nDOWN",

DOWN is a HARD NO because Snake #1\u2019s head sits at (4,7); I\u2019m not jumping into another head\u2019s turf even if the dude might shift. That would be a direct death wish. Can you even imagine the chat going wild if I suicide that early?\n\nUP keeps us safe but starts to shrink options (no more room above). RIGHT is chill, but LEFT lets us immediately chase the apple column while staying far from Snake #1\u2019s potential up/down rush. Heading LEFT gives us space to weave and keeps a ton of follow-up moves open\u2014no walls, no opponents breathing down our necks, and the apple trail is literally screaming our name. Let\u2019s own that left corridor, keep our options wide, and make Snake #1 sweat. Who\u2019s ready for some domination?\n\nPlan: Push left toward the apple gauntlet on the west edge while keeping the center clear so Snake #1 can\u2019t pin us between the wall and his body.\n\nLEFT",

But we stayed cool, we stayed collected, and we went **DOWN** to (4, 6)! That's how you treat a noob trying to start beef too early! RESPECT THE VET!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (Post Turn 2 Move Down to (4, 6)):**\nMy Head: (4, 6)\nMy Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7)] <- LENGTH is now 2! We grew with that first apple! LET'S GO!\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 8) or (5, 8) or (4, 9) or (4, 7)? We don't know their move yet! We only know they started at (4, 8).\n\nWe are now entering the SECRET PHASE! Since moves are simultaneous, we have to PREDICT what Snake #0 did!\n\n**Turn 2 Prediction Analysis (Snake #0 starting at (4, 8)):**\n1. If Snake #0 moved **DOWN** to (4, 7) (My old spot): If they land on (4, 7), they survive.\n2. If Snake #0 moved **UP** to (4, 9): They survive.\n3. If Snake #0 moved **LEFT** to (3, 8): They survive (This is where they started last turn, so they moved from somewhere to (4, 8) and now move back left? Wait, the board shows their head at (3, 8) for Turn 3! **AHA!**).\n\nLet's check the board state provided for Turn 3 setup!\n\n**NEW BOARD STATE FOR TURN 3:**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (4, 6), Body: [(4, 7)], Apples collected: 1.\n*WAIT!* The provided board state shows my body as *only* [(4, 7)]. If I ate an apple on Turn 1, and I moved DOWN on Turn 2, and I moved safely, my new body should be [(4, 7), (4, 6)] if I grew, or [(4, 8), (4, 7)] if I didn't grow on Turn 2.\n\n**CRITICAL RE-READ OF BOARD STATE:**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (4, 6), Body: [(4, 7)]. Apples collected: 1.\nIf my head is (4, 6) and my body is [(4, 7)], this means my previous head *was* (4, 7).\nIf I moved DOWN to (4, 6) and *DID NOT* eat an apple, my body should be [(4, 7)]. THIS MATCHES!\n**Conclusion on Turn 2:** My move DOWN did NOT result in eating an apple. I am still length 1 (Head + 1 segment).\n\n**OPPONENTS (Turn 3):**\n* Snake #0 - Head: (3, 8), Body: none, Apples: 0\n* This means Snake #0 moved from (4, 8) to (3, 8) (LEFT). They survived the standoff!\n\n**Current State (Turn 3, Start):**\nMy Head: (4, 6). My Body: [(4, 7)]. (Total length 2)\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 8).\n\n**APPLE HUNT:**\nApples near me: (3, 2), (6, 2). The cluster is still far. The closest apple is (0, 4) or (0, 5) way up left, or (6, 5) up right.\n\n**Collision Analysis (Turn 3):**\nMy possible moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7):** DANGER! (4, 7) is MY OWN BODY! SELF-DESTRUCT! NO WAY!\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5):** SAFE. Clear cell.\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 6):** SAFE. Clear cell.\n4. **LEFT to (3, 6):** SAFE. Clear cell.\n\nSnake #0 Head is at (3, 8). We are far away from them! Time to breathe and look for content!\n\n**The Goal:** We need to eat! We are too small! We need this length upgrade!\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n*   (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) are on the left wall.\n*   (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6) are top right.\n*   (3, 2), (6, 2) are central bottom.\n\nMy position at (4, 6) is in the dead center of the top half. Moving toward the bottom offers more space to maneuver than swinging hard left toward the wall apples immediately.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (4, 5)**: Next turn I can decide to sweep left or right, or continue down towards (3, 2) or (6, 2). This feels like a strong central move, maintaining maximum options.\nIf I go **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This sets me up nicely to dive towards (3, 2) if Snake #0 stays high.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: This sets me up towards (6, 5) or (7, 5).\n\nLet's look at the nearest content: (6, 5) and (7, 5). The distance is 2 or 3 units away diagonally. If I move RIGHT to (5, 6), I am setting up a diagonal approach to those apples.\n\nSnake #0 is high at (3, 8). They are likely moving toward the top edge (4, 9) or sweeping left/right along Row 8/9. If they move UP to (3, 9), they are contained up top. If they move LEFT to (2, 8), they are heading towards the left wall.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: I am heading towards the right sector. This splits the map nicely. If Snake #0 drifts left, I claim the central/right apples unopposed!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Establish control on the mid-to-high sections of the map. Focus on the right-side apple cluster ((8, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 4)). We are currently safe and need to capitalize on space while the opponent is exploring the top-left.\n\nI commit to the **RIGHT** flank! Let's get some length!\n\nRIGHT",

If I ate, my score goes up from 1, and my body grows!\n\n---\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE FOR TURN 4:**\nAPPLE DROPS: (0, 4), (8, 6), (6, 5), (0, 5), (7, 5), (6, 2), (0, 6), (3, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), (8, 4), (0, 3)\nSCOREBOARD:\n  - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 1 (**STILL 1??**)\n  - Snake #0 apples: 0\n\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (5, 6)\n  - Body: [(4, 6)]  <-- THIS IS THE HUGE CLUE!\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n1. My score is **STILL 1**! I did NOT eat the apple I was aiming for!\n2. My Head is (5, 6). My body is just [(4, 6)]. This means my previous head (4, 6) became the tail segment, and my old tail segment [(4, 7)] was kicked off.\n3. **CONCLUSION:** My move **RIGHT** to (5, 6) did not hit an apple! I lost length one segment, which is standard movement when not consuming content! This is a necessary sacrifice for position! Position is EVERYTHING!\n\n**Snake #0 Position Check (Turn 4 Input):**\n* Snake #0 - Head: (2, 8), Body: none, Apples: 0.\n* Snake #0 was at (3, 8) last turn. They moved **LEFT** to (2, 8). They are hugging the top-left wall! They are still small, avoiding me! SMART, but scared!\n\n**Our Current State (Turn 4 Start):**\nMy Head: (5, 6). My Body: [(4, 6)]. Length 2. We are healthy, central, and looking sharp!\nSnake #0 Head: (2, 8). Far away, exploring the top perimeter.\n\n**APPLE HUNT & DANGER ZONE REVIEW:**\nWhere did the apples go? Look at the map!\nThe map shows a massive apple cluster on the left wall: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1). That's tempting, but being stuck on the wall is DEATH.\nThe right cluster is still there: (8, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4). This looks like the long-term goal.\n\n**Checking immediate threats/opportunities from (5, 6):**\nPossible moves from (5, 6):\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Sets me up nicely towards the upper right apples (8, 6).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Centralizes me more. Sets up a dive for (6, 2), (3, 2).\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Pushes me further towards the right wall cluster. **High potential!**\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** DANGER! (4, 6) is my own body! **SELF-DESTRUCT!** NO GO!\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 8). If they move UP, they hit (2, 9). If they move RIGHT, into (3, 8). If they move DOWN, into (2, 7). We are nowhere near them! This is our time to feast while the predator explores boring territory!\n\nI am aiming for that cluster on the right flank! (6, 5) is the closest appealing apple to my current path. By going **RIGHT to (6, 6)**, I position myself perfectly to strike (6, 5) next turn, or pivot towards (7, 5)! Going RIGHT maximizes map control and appetite!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Continue aggressive content acquisition towards the right side of the board. Maintain central mass control to prevent entrapment should Snake #0 suddenly sweep inwards. Avoid the left wall cluster until Snake #0 vacates the top area. We need length fast!\n\nI am going **RIGHT** to (6, 6)! GIMME THAT APPLE!\n\nRIGHT",

Did we set ourselves up for the feast? LET'S FIND OUT!\n\n**CURRENT HEAD POSITION:** (6, 6)\n**MY CURRENT BODY:** [(5, 6), (4, 6)] (Wait, let's re-verify the body structure based on the input! Last turn, I was at (5, 6) and my body was [(4, 6)]. If I moved RIGHT to (6, 6) and DIDN'T eat, my new body should be [(5, 6)]. My length is staying the same, which is fine for now!)\n\nLet's look at the board state to confirm my length change and my score update!\nTurn: 5 / 150\nSnake #1 Apples: 1 (Still 1! No immediate payoff!)\n\n**If I didn't eat, my body shifts:**\nOld Head (5, 6) -> New 1st Segment.\nOld 1st Segment (4, 6) -> New 2nd Segment.\nOld Tail pops off!\n\nBased on the BOARD STATE PROVIDED at the START of Turn 5:\nMY SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (6, 6) <-- WOW! So the input implies my move LEFT TO RIGHT was successful in getting me the coordinates for the next turn! The board state reflects the *result* of my move from Turn 4! Phew! If my last move was RIGHT, and I landed on (6, 6), and my previous head was (5, 6), then I definitely did NOT eat!\n  - Body: [(5, 6)] <-- This means my length is 2: (6, 6) -> (5, 6). My old tail must have been kicked off! NO APPLE GAIN! This confirms my analysis that my move to (5, 6) was just repositioning!\n\n**NOW, we are at (6, 6) STARTING TURN 5!**\n**APPLE GOALS:** The closest juicy target is (6, 5)! It's DIRECtly below the apple I was just near!\n\n**Snake #0 POSITION:** (1, 8). They are still chilling up top! They haven't moved towards any apples yet, just exploring between (1, 8) and (2, 8) last turn! They are NOT a threat yet!\n\n**Checking Safe Moves from (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Keeps me central for a cross-board move later. Not hitting anything immediately.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** **APPLE! (6, 5)!** If I go DOWN, I EAT! My score goes to 2, and I GROW! This is the priority!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** DANGER! (5, 6) is my own body! INSTANT DEATH! NO!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Moves me towards the edge group ((8, 6), (8, 4), etc.).\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT CHECK (Crucial!):**\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5) and EAT, I grow.\nWhere is Snake #0 going? If they move (1, 8) to (0, 8) or (2, 8) or (1, 7) or (1, 9), there is NO collision with (6, 5).\n\n**CONCLUSION FOR TURN 5:**\nWe have an immediate, safe, growth opportunity! We must seize content when it's presented directly in front of us without high risk! Going DOWN to (6, 5) gets us an apple, increases our length, and puts us in a better position on the right flank! This is a no-brainer! GET THAT FOOD!\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Secure the right-side cluster. If we can eat (6, 5) now, the path to (7, 5) and (8, 6) opens up beautifully next turn. We need to be BIG before Snake #0 decides to sweep down the middle. Priority: CONTENT > map control.\n\nI'm going **DOWN** to claim (6, 5)! Let's GOOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

We are DOMINATING the early game!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (STARTING TURN 6):**\n*   **MY HEAD:** We just ate at (6, 5). Since we grew, our new body structure needs recalculation based on the move DOWN from (6, 6).\n    *   Old Head: (6, 6)\n    *   New Head: (6, 5) (Where we ate!)\n    *   New Body (Old Head becomes 1st segment): [(6, 6), **(5, 6)**] (My body was [(6, 6), (5, 6)] before the move, and the tail popped off last round, but since we ATE, the old head (6, 6) becomes the first segment, and the old body shifts down, with our old head (6, 6) now being the *second* segment.

We have a nice little path developing on the right side!\n\n**SAFE MOVES FROM (6, 5):**\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** DANGER! This is my own body! (6, 6) is the 1st segment of my body! **SUICIDE! NO!**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Safe. Moves us slightly towards the middle bottom.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** Safe. Moves us towards the center mass.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** **APPLE (7, 5)!** This is a direct follow-up eat! If we move here, we GROW AGAIN! SCOOOORE!\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT CHECK (The real test!):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I eat the apple and grow.\nWhere is Snake #0 going from (0, 8)? They have a massive open field. They are likely moving towards the nearest apple pile in the top left cluster: (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1). Best guess: They move UP to (0, 9) or DOWN to (0, 7) or LEFT/RIGHT if they think they can flank. Since they have no body, they are unconstrained. Let's assume they go DOWN toward (0, 7) or UP to (0, 9) to secure the corner.\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves to (0, 7), there is absolutely NO collision with my move to (7, 5).\n*   If Snake #0 attempts a RARE cross-board move to (7, ?) or (5, ?), that's highly unlikely given their starting position and the density of their targets.\n\n**RATIONALE FOR MOVE:**\nWhy wouldn't I take the immediate second apple?! We are building momentum! We need to get HUGE before Snake #0 wakes up and realizes they are losing this race! SECURING (7, 5) makes our snake 4 segments long! Snake #0 is still size 1!\n\n**Strategy Note:** We are currently going for high-value local clusters on the right side. Once we clear (7, 5), we can look toward (8, 6) or perhaps weave back down to secure the (8, 4) region. We want length advantage!\n\nI'm going **RIGHT** to grab that second consecutive apple!

Snake #0 is still way over there playing hide-and-seek. We are currently leading the charge!\n\n**CURRENT STATE RECAP (Starting Turn 7):**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 5). We moved RIGHT last turn and ate the apple at (7, 5).\n*   **My Body:** Since we ate, we grew! My new body, assuming the previous structure was [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)] and the move was from (6, 5) to (7, 5) (RIGHT), should now be: Head (7, 5), Body [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Length 4! We are getting DANGEROUSLY big!\n*   **Opponent Snake #0:** Last known Head: (0, 7) (Assuming they continued moving down from (0, 8) in turn 6, as they were unconstrained).\n\n**BOARD CHECK (Turn 7 Start):**\n*   **My Position:** (7, 5).\n*   **My Body Segments:** (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6). (Toss out the old tail (5, 6) if we successfully ate, meaning the new tail is the old body segment before growth. If we ate, we grew by 1. Previous length 3 -> New length 4: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]). **Let's confirm the geometry visually against the provided board state for Turn 7:**\n    *   Head (7, 5) **IS** on the board!\n    *   Body: (6, 5) is A (Apple we ate). (6, 6) is T (Tail segment?). (5, 6) is T (Tail segment?).\n    *   **Hold up, the provided board state must reflect the end of Turn 6.**\n    *   My Snake (ID 1) is: Head (7, 5), Body [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)].\n    *   Apples collected: 3.\n    *   Wait, if I *just* ate at (6, 5) on Turn 6, my head *was* (6, 5). If my move was RIGHT to (7, 5) and I ate, the board state should look like the *start* of Turn 7. The input board state shows my head at (7, 5) and my body is [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. This means the apple at (6, 5) is *gone*, and my head is at (7, 5). This strongly implies my RIGHT move on Turn 6 WAS successful and I ATE the apple at (7, 5) **if that apple existed there**.\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION OF BOARD STATE & RATIONALE:**\nMy rationale stated I would move RIGHT to (7, 5) based on the apple list: (0, 4), (8, 6), (0, 5), (6, 2), (0, 6), (3, 2), **(9, 4)**, (0, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), **(8, 4)**, (0, 3), (3, 3), **(4, 3)**.\nThe *apple list* provided for Turn 7 **does not contain an apple at (7, 5)**!\n\n**MY RATIONALE WAS BASED ON A GHOST APPLE!**\nIf I moved RIGHT to (7, 5) last turn, and there was no apple there, I simply moved to (7, 5) and my tail popped off!\n*   My body *before* the move (based on the rationale describing the last move): Head (6, 5), Body [(6, 6), (5, 6)]. (Length 3)\n*   My move was RIGHT to (7, 5).\n*   Since I didn't eat, my tail popped off. New Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6)]. (Length 3)\n\n**BUT THE INPUT BOARD STATE SAYS:**\nHead: (7, 5). Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Length 4!\nThis *only* happens if I ATE something on Turn 6.\nThe only available apple near (6, 5) was (8, 6), (8, 4) or perhaps (6, 2). If my head was (6, 5) and I moved RIGHT to (7, 5), I must have eaten an apple at (7, 5) for the board state above to be true *plus* my count going from 2 to 3 apples!\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Despite the visible apple list not showing (7, 5), the resulting state **MUST** mean I ate an apple there to achieve Length 4 and Score 3. I trust the provided game state over the static apple list that supposedly pertains to Turn 7's *starting* position. **I ATE! I AM LENGTH 4!**\n\n**NEW CURRENT STATE (CONFIRMED):**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 5)\n*   **My Body (Length 4):** [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)] - Wait, length 4 means 1 head + 3 body segments. The input lists Head: (7, 5) and Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. This is correct for length 4!\n*   **Apples:** 3.\n\n**Snake #0 Head:** (0, 7). They are drifting down the left wall!\n\n**NEW APPLE TARGETS NEAR (7, 5):**\n1.  (8, 6) - Up-Right. Promising!\n2.  (8, 4) - Down-Right. Also promising!\n3.  (6, 2) / (3, 2) / (3, 3) / (4, 3) - Far, center-left cluster.\n\n**Collision Check (My move from (7, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** Safe space. Next target (8, 6) is 1 move away.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** Safe space. Next target (8, 4) is 1 move away.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** **BODY COLLISION!** Segment 1! DEAD! NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** Safe space. Moves toward the edge, opens up line to (8, 6) and (8, 4) next turn.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 7)):**\nThey are hugging the left wall. They have apples at (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1). They are currently at (0, 7).\n*   If they go UP to (0, 8) or (0, 9) - No collision.\n*   If they go DOWN to (0, 6) - They eat! (Not currently relevant to us, but good to note).\n*   If they try to cross the board radically (e.g., go RIGHT to (1, 7)) - Highly unlikely given high density of targets on their side.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We have built a strong body that curls up toward the top left of our current zone. We need to keep moving outward to secure the high-value apples on the right edge while maintaining maximum survivability. Moving towards the edge is usually safer because you have fewer boundaries to worry about adjacent bodies/walls.\n\nMoving UP to (7, 6) positions us perfectly to attack (8, 6) next turn while keeping a clear path towards (8, 4) by going right next move. Moving RIGHT to (8, 5) is also very aggressive towards the edge, but leaves us without the immediate shot at the (8, 6) apple. (7, 6) feels like better positioning to capitalize on the top edge apple cluster.\n\nLet's go UP to (7, 6) and prepare to snag that (8, 6) apple next turn! We are GOING FOR THE MVP!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Clear the right edge apples ((8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 0)) forming a long string, then use that length to safely curve inwards towards the center mass of remaining apples ((4, 3), (3, 3), etc.) while keeping an eye socket peeled for Snake #0 moving across the middle void.\n\nUP",

We are cooking with gas now! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's re-verify the board and our position after that glorious feast:\nMy Head: (7, 5). My Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. We are L-shaped, heading towards the top-right quadrant!\n\nSnake #0 is chilling at (0, 7). They seem content to sweep the left wall for now. They have a body of length 1 now, meaning they only have 2 segments including the head. They are *still* small prey!\n\n**Target Assessment for Turn 8:**\n1. **(8, 6):** The top-right apple. If we move UP to (7, 6), we can snag this next turn! (Ideal move if safe)\n2. **(8, 4):** The lower-right apple. If we move DOWN to (7, 4), we can snag this next turn!\n3. **(8, 5):** Edge move. Gets us into the corner faster.\n\n**Candidate Moves & Safety Check (Turn 8):**\n\nWe must consider simultaneous movement! Snake #0 is at (0, 7). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT ((1, 7)), that's totally fine for us since we are far away. If they move UP/DOWN, also fine. We are not near each other yet. Our immediate concern is self-preservation and maximizing apple acquisition.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. No body contact, not off the board.\n    *   *Future:* Positions us perfectly to reach (8, 6) on Turn 9! If we move UP, our new tail pops off (5, 6) -> new tail is (6, 6). Our new length is still 4.\n    *   *Enemy Check:* No immediate threat.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. No body contact, not off the board.\n    *   *Future:* Positions us to reach (8, 4) on Turn 9. Also very good.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. No body contact, not off the board.\n    *   *Future:* Puts us right on the edge. Next turn we can move UP to (8, 6) (eating the apple A!) OR move DOWN to (8, 4) (eating the apple A!) or even potentially LEFT back into the field. This move maximizes immediate access to the right wall apples.\n\n**The Grind Mentality:** Getting adjacent to an apple cluster is key. Moving RIGHT to (8, 5) puts us right next to *both* (8, 6) and (8, 4). This forces Snake #0 to react defensively if they ever venture this far right, and it maximizes our options for the next 2-3 turns! UP or DOWN only commits us to one apple path immediately. RIGHT sets up a fork!\n\nLet's execute the pincer maneuver on the right edge! Maximize the value of this new length!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR TURNS 8-11:** Secure the right edge apples (8, 6) and (8, 4) immediately. Use the resulting length to start sweeping inwards towards the center cluster or outwards towards (8, 1) and (8, 0). Stay clear of Snake #0 until we are big enough to dominate the map!\n\nMove decision: RIGHT! Time to hug that wall!\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT? Off the map, so that\u2019s a hard pass. RIGHT doesn\u2019t kill us, but does it keep the apple train coming? Not even close, it tees us away from the juicy column of fruit and opens zero pressure on this side of the board.

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We just dropped a MASSIVE strategic move last turn, going RIGHT to hug that wall! 8, 5 is our new home! Did it secure the V-ROYALE energy?! Let's see what the universe, and that pesky Snake #0, served up this turn! Turn 9, we are LOCKED and LOADED!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 9):**\nMy Head: (8, 6). Wait, what?! My rationale said I moved to (8, 5), but the board state says my head is at (8, 6) and my body is different!\n\nLet's re-read the input *carefully*.\n\nPrevious Move Rationale concluded with **RIGHT**.\nIf I moved RIGHT from (7, 5) last turn (Turn 8), my head should be at (8, 5).\nMy body last turn was [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)] before the move, length 4. If I move RIGHT, my new head is (8, 5), and my tail (5, 6) disappears, leaving body [(7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)].\n\nHowever, the **CURRENT BOARD STATE** for Turn 9 shows:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (8, 6)\n  - Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 4 (This means we must have eaten an apple last turn!)\n\n**CRITICAL DEDUCTION:** My previous move (RIGHT) must have resulted in me eating an apple!\nIf my head was at (7, 5) and I moved RIGHT, I landed on (8, 5).\nIf (8, 5) was an apple, I ate it. Length increases if I eat.\nIf I ate an apple, my new head is (8, 5), and my tail *does not* retract!\n\nLet's look at the APPLE DROPS list: **(8, 5)** IS an active apple drop!\nOkay, so last turn (Turn 8): I moved RIGHT. I ate the apple at (8, 5). My length increased by 1! I should be length 5 now, and my tail should *not* have moved!\n\nLet's reconstruct Turn 8 based on the current state *assuming I ate the apple at (8, 5)*:\nStart Head: (7, 5). Start Length: 4. Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)].\nMove: RIGHT -> New Head: (8, 5). EAT! Length becomes 5. Old Tail (5, 6) REMAINS.\nNew Body (Tail to Head, reversed for clarity): [(5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 5)] -> Head (8, 5).\n\nThis still doesn't match the current state: Head (8, 6), Body [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. Apple Count: 4 (Matches eating 1 apple).\n\nThe current length is 5 (4 body segments + head).\n\n**The only way to get to Head (8, 6) and Body [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)] is if:**\n1. Last turn I moved **UP** from (7, 5) to (7, 6). (This is safe, but I planned RIGHT).\n2. And I ate an apple at (7, 6). Wait, (7, 6) is NOT an apple!\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The automated game engine *must* have processed my move, the opponent's move, and potentially an apple consumption check, resulting in the current state. I must trust the current board state as the absolute truth for Turn 9 decision-making, regardless of my previous flawed intention output!\n\n**TRUST THE BOARD:**\nHead: (8, 6). Length 5.\nSnake #0 Head: (0, 5). Length 3. (They must have eaten too or grown slowly).\n\n**Apple Check:**\nThe apple I was aiming for, (8, 6), is GONE because that is my HEAD now! Wait, (8, 6) is my HEAD.\nThe apple at (8, 4) is still there (A)!\nThe apple at (8, 5) is GONE (I must have eaten it, increasing score from 3 to 4, matching the scoreboard!).\n\n**Turn 9 Target Sequence:**\n1. Secure (8, 4)! We are right above it!\n2. Assess Snake #0 threat. (0, 5). They are far away.\n\n**Candidate Moves from (8, 6):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 5): (EAT (8, 4) NEXT TURN?)**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe position. If I move DOWN, I land on (8, 5). (8, 5) is empty space now (I ate it last turn). My new tail pops off (6, 6).\n    *   *Future:* Next turn (T10), I move DOWN again to (8, 4) and eat! This is a guaranteed apple sequence! UP (8, 7) is also safe next turn. This path is very controlled.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. Lands on T (Snake #0's tail if they moved right?). No, T belongs to Snake #0's body if they were moving right, but their body is at (0, 6), (0, 7). (7, 6) is currently empty space! (Wait, let's check the board again carefully...)\n    *   Board: 6 T . . . . . T T 1 . -> (6, 6) is T, (7, 6) is T. MY body is [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. (7, 6) IS MY BODY! Moving LEFT lands me on my own body! **FATAL ERROR! LEFT IS DEATH!**\n\n3.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. Next turn I can move UP to (8, 8) or LEFT/RIGHT. This seems less direct than securing (8, 4).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   *Self Check:* Safe. Hugs the wall. Next step is (9, 5) or (9, 7). Good path, but doesn't directly lead to the immediate apple at (8, 4).\n\n**Decision:** DOWN seems strongest! It sets up a perfect path to the known apple at (8, 4) next turn, AND it moves us away from the ceiling, giving us room above if needed. Snake #0 is nowhere near us on the West side. We focus on the bounty!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure (8, 4) on Turn 10. Then, we can start sweeping inward towards the center, or further down the wall towards (8, 1) and (8, 0). We are current leader (4 apples vs 2), let's maintain the dominance and grow huge! We are length 5, they are length 3. We will crush them when we meet!\n\nMove Decision: DOWN! Time to collect the next piece of the treasure!\n\nDOWN",

We executed the DOWN maneuver last turn, setting up a beautiful trajectory for the one at (8, 4). Now let's see what that rodent, Snake #0, did with their little snake body!\n\n**Checking Opponent Move (Snake #0, Head at (0, 4)):**\nTheir head is at (0, 4). Their body is [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. They are chilling next to the wall. They have 3 apples.\n\nWhere did they move from? If they moved UP from (0, 3), they missed the apple at (0, 3). If they moved LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, where did they land? We don't know their move, only their new position!\n\nLet's check the apples relative to Snake #0's new position (0, 4):\nApples remaining: (6, 2), (3, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), (8, 4), (9, 0), (7, 0).\n(0, 4) is adjacent to (0, 3) and (0, 2) (Wait, (0, 3) is an apple A! (0, 2) is an apple A!). Snake #0 is POISED to eat!\n\n**CRITICAL THREAT ANALYSIS:** Snake #0 is at (0, 4). If they moved UP from (0, 3), they just ate that apple! If they moved DOWN from (0, 5) (which is currently occupied by their body segment!), that's impossible unless they grew dramatically!\n\nGiven their previous head was (0, 4) and their body was [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)], and their current head is (0, 4) and body is [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]... WAIT. The board state for Snake #0 didn't change?\n*Board State:* 4 0 . . . . . . . A A -> Snake #0 Head is (0, 4).\n*Snake #0 Definition:* Head: (0, 4), Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)].\nThis implies Snake #0 EITHER moved backward (impossible!) OR moved and did NOT grow (meaning they didn't eat an apple), OR their move resulted in them landing on an empty spot and their tail fell off, OR the game state provided for them IS their position *after* their move.\n\nSince the board explicitly shows the position for Turn 10, we assume Snake #0 moved from some position X to (0, 4). If they didn't grow (score is 3), their tail segment (0, 7) has fallen off.\nIf they moved UP from (0, 3) -> (0, 4) and ATE (0, 3), their score should be 4, and their body should be longer! They are score 3.\nIf they moved DOWN from (0, 5) -> (0, 4) [Impossible, (0, 5) is their segment].\nIf they moved RIGHT from (-1, 4) [Impossible, off-board].\nIf they moved LEFT from (1, 4) -> (0, 4). This is the only way they land at (0, 4) without eating, and their tail segment (0, 7) falls off. New body: [(0, 5), (0, 6)]. Length 2! Wait, they are listed as length 3 (Head + 2 body). So their tail did fall off if they moved LEFT from (1, 4).\n\n**BIGGEST TAKEAWAY:** Snake #0 is NOT an immediate threat on my side of the board (8, 6). I can focus purely on optimizing MY position!\n\n**Analyzing My Move from (8, 6) [DOWN]:**\n1. **Move: DOWN to (8, 5).**\n   *   IS (8, 5) safe? Yes, it was occupied by an apple last turn, now it's empty space.\n   *   My new body will be [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. My old tail (6, 6) remains. Length stays 5.\n   *   Next turn: I can move DOWN to (8, 4) and eat the apple! This is solid setup.\n\n2. **Move: UP to (8, 7).**\n   *   Safe. Next turn, I can go (8, 8) or (7, 7) or (9, 7). Puts me near the ceiling, but gives options.\n\n3. **Move: LEFT to (7, 6).**\n   *   **FATAL!** As analyzed last turn, (7, 6) is part of my current body! (Head: (8, 6), Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]). Moving LEFT hits (7, 6). **DEATH! Do not pick LEFT!**\n\n4. **Move: RIGHT to (9, 6).**\n   *   Safe. Moves me along the wall. Good secondary option if DOWN felt too slow.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nDOWN sets up a guaranteed apple in 1 turn: (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> EAT (8, 4). That's the V-ROYALE path! I'm going for the guaranteed CONTENT!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Turn 11 & Beyond:** After eating (8, 4) on T11, my head will be at (8, 4). I will then have a clear shot down the wall towards (8, 1) and (8, 0). We own the entire right flank! We need to push this advantage while Snake #0 is busy cleaning up their side, or potentially moving towards the middle.\n\nI stick with the setup move. DOWN we go!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S SECURE THE BAG! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Current State Check (My Head at (8, 5)):**\nMy goal is to move **DOWN** to (8, 4) and EAT that apple!\n\n**Opponent Check (Snake #0 Head at (0, 4)):**\nWhere the heck is that bot going? It's nestled in the corner, near apples (0, 2) and (0, 1). It likely wants to eat one of those. If it moves UP to (0, 5) (into its own body - impossible unless it starved its tail), or LEFT/RIGHT into the wall, or DOWN to (0, 3) (which is an apple!).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves **DOWN** from (0, 4) to (0, 3) and eats the apple there, they grow, and their new head is (0, 3). My move is DOWN to (8, 4). We are far apart, so collision risk is ZERO this turn! Sweet!\n\n**Move Analysis (Head at (8, 5)):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Action:** EAT APPLE (8, 4)! Score rockets to 7! My tail segment at (6, 6) falls off (Wait, my body was [(8, 5 - my spot], (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. When I move DOWN, (8, 6) becomes the new tail, and (6, 6) falls off. Since I ATE, my length increases by 1, so the tail STAYS! New body length 7! AMAZING!\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 4) is CLEAR.\n    *   **Future:** I am now in prime real estate along the right edge, ready to sweep down towards (8, 1) and (8, 0) next turn! This is the win condition path!\n\n2.  **UP to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe, but boring. Resets my upward momentum.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Action:** HITS MY OWN BODY! (7, 5) is my second segment from the head from T10! (My T10 move was DOWN to (8, 5). My T9 head was (8, 4). My T10 body became [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. Wait, my *old* body was [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. I moved DOWN to (8, 5). So my *new* body after T10 move was: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. Ah, I see the confusion in my previous rationale reading. Let's re-verify T10 body shape:\n        *   T10 Head (8, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)] (Length 4). Wait, I collected 6 apples. My body should be longer!\n        *   **Recalculating T10 Body State:** If I have 6 apples, my body length is 6 segments long in addition to the head (Total 7 segments).\n        *   **MY SNAKE (ID: 1) T10 (Start of Turn 11 Rationale):** Head (8, 4). Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. This is 6 segments total (Head + 5 Body). Ah, 6 apples collected means 6 *growth* events. If I started at 1, I should have 7 segments total. Let's trust the provided structure: Head + 6 Body segments = 7 total cells.\n        *   **My Move T10 was DOWN:** Head moved from (8, 4) to (8, 5). Since I *didn't* eat on T10, my TAIL (6, 6) fell off.\n        *   **My Body (T11 Start):** Head (8, 5). Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. This is only 5 segments! Wait, the input says: Head: (8, 4), Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]. THAT IS 6 BODY SEGMENTS! **The provided board state shows the result AFTER T10, which implies I ATE on T10 OR my tail didn't drop.**\n        *   **Crucial Inference:** Since my current stored body list has 6 segments, I must have GROWN on T10, or the system only lists the body segments *after* the move but *before* the tail is implicitly dropped/accounted for with growth. Given I'm at 6 apples, and the board shows 6 segments behind the head, I must assume the listed structure is accurate for collision checks.\n\n    *   **Re-checking Head (8, 4) move was DOWN to (8, 5).**\n    *   **T11 BODY CHECK (Based on provided list for collision):** My body occupies: (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6). (My head is at (8, 4) now, wait, NO! My head is (8, 4) for the START of T11, based on the prompt! The *last move* explanation suggests I moved DOWN FROM (8, 6) to (8, 5) on T10. The prompt structure is confusing: \"Turn: 11\" implies we are planning T11. But the body listed is the state *before* T11's move.)\n\n    *   **Let's assume the provided structure is the current state, AND my last move was RATIONALE'd (DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5))**\n\n    *   **If Head was (8, 6) at T10 start, and I moved DOWN to (8, 5), and DID NOT EAT:**\n        Old Tail (6, 6) falls off. New Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)] -> (8, 6) would be the new head! This contradicts the listed Head (8, 4).\n\n    *   **Let's TRUST the explicit list provided for T11 Start:**\n        *   Head: (8, 4)\n        *   Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)]\n        *   This means the DOWN move from T10 *resulted* in the head being at (8, 4), which contradicts the rationale saying the move was DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5) (which would put the head at 8, 5).\n\n    *   **Resolution**: I must ignore the flawed rationale about the T10 move and trust the **CURRENT BOARD STATE** for collision checking and the **TARGET APPLE** for planning!\n    *   **My Head is at (8, 4).**\n    *   **My Body occupies:** (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6).\n    *   **Target Apple:** (6, 2) (Too far), (3, 2), (9, 4), (0, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (9, 0), (7, 0).\n    *   **The closest, most logical move is to eat the apple at (9, 4) or move towards the bottom half.**\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the RATIONALE's *intent*: The player *wanted* to move to (8, 5) to set up (8, 4) for this turn! Since the current head is (8, 4), that move *already happened* in some fashion, or the target apple moved! The target apple is now at (8, 4) in the list of *remaining* apples, but the board shows an 'A' at (8, 4) for Snake 1! Wait, no, the board shows:\n        `4 T A . . . . . . . 1 A` -> Snake 1 Head is at (8, 4). There is an Apple 'A' listed at (9, 4)!\n\n    *   **Wait, let's map the current state precisely one more time:**\n        *   HEAD: (8, 4). (This is '1' on the board).\n        *   Apple 'A' is literally right next to the head at **(9, 4)** (according to the BOARD map key `4 T A . . . . . . . 1 A`).\n        *   The list of APPLE DROPS remaining shows (9, 4) is still there.\n\n    This confirms the plan: **I need to move RIGHT to (9, 4)!** This is the content!\n\n**Move Analysis (Head at (8, 4)):**\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Action:** EAT APPLE (9, 4)! Score becomes 7! I grow! My tail segment (6, 6) falls off IF I didn't eat. Since I eat, I grow, length maintained/increased.\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 4) is clear space (only other thing on row 4 is the Snake #1 indicator, my head!).\n    *   **Future:** Excellent position on the right wall. Sets up (9, 5) or (9, 3) next turn.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe. Moves me towards the cluster of apples in rows 2/3. Good, but RIGHT secures immediate points.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe. Moves me away from the right-side apples. Why would I retreat? No.\n\n4.  **UP to (8, 5):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe. I was here last turn (based on the intent of the rationale)! Resets the move. Why stay still when there is food adjacent?\n\n**Conclusion:** The path is illuminated by the gods of content! (9, 4) is staring me down! Snake #0 is nowhere near me. We consolidate the right side!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure (9, 4). Next turn, I will likely move UP to (9, 5) or DOWN to (9, 3) to clear the right wall safely, then begin a sweeping motion inward, perhaps towards the middle apple (5, 5). We are dominating this side, let the rat handle the corner!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is still chilling in the 0-column, probably plotting some sad, slow demise. We are not them! We are the content machine! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Current State Check (Head at (9, 4)):**\nMy body is long, but thanks to eating, it's structurally sound! We are patrolling the right edge!\n\n**Apple Focus:**\nRemaining apples: (6, 2), (3, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (0, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (5, 1).\nThe next juicy targets are (8, 1) and (8, 0) right below me! Then we can pivot left towards (6, 3) or (5, 5).\n\n**Opponent Check (Snake #0 Head at (0, 2)):**\nWait, in my **LAST RATIONALE**, I predicted Snake #0 would take (0, 3)! But the board state shows it MUST have eaten (0, 1) or maybe (0, 2) was its previous position and it moved *up*? Let's check the board:\nSnake #0 Head is at (0, 2). Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. This bot is moving UP the left wall! It has 5 apples. It's moving slow, but it's moving *organized*.\n\nIf Snake #0 was at (0, 3) and moved UP to (0, 2) last turn, it didn't eat. If it was at (0, 1) and moved UP, it ate and grew! Since its body ends cleanly at (0, 7), it seems to have moved UPWARDS along the wall. If it moved UP again, it hits (0, 1) (an apple!).\n\n**Move Analysis (Head at (9, 4)):**\n\nMy body segments are: (9, 4) Head, (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6). (Length Check: 8 segments total, 7 eaten = 7 body segments + head. Wait, I just ate (9, 4) last turn, so I should be 8 segments long if I didn't lose a tail. If I had 6 before, I now have 7 body segments). Let's trust the board visualization: it looks like 7 cells behind the head.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe. Gets me closer to the cluster (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3). This clears the path to the bottom right corner apples (8, 1), (8, 0).\n    *   **Opponent Risk:** Zero interaction risk. Snake #0 is far away.\n    *   **Future:** Keeps momentum focused down the right wall. Very strong candidate.\n\n2.  **UP to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Action:** Safe. Moves towards (9, 7). A bit further away from the immediate harvest. Why go up when food is immediately below? BORING!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Action:** HITS OWN BODY! (8, 4) is my second segment!

UP is safe but passive. We MUST go DOWN to clean up the right side bounty!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure (9, 3) next turn, then aim straight for (8, 1) and (8, 0). Once the right wall is clean, we pivot left towards the center mass of apples. We are playing the perimeter dominance game!

We are on Turn 13 and we just sent our snake head down to (9, 3) last move, securing our position near those bottom-right apples! Eight apples in the bin! Snake #0 is still creeping up the left wall like a shy little vine. We are the bulldozer! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Current Snake 1 Position:** Head at (9, 3).\n**Body:** [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5)] (Length 8).\n\n**Apple Targets:** (6, 2), (3, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (5, 1).\nThe immediate buffet is right below us: (8, 1) and (8, 0)! If we can snag one of those, we're looking at 9 apples! \ud83e\udd11\n\n**Snake #0 Position (Head at (0, 2)).** Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. It is highly likely it will move UP to (0, 1) to grab that apple, or perhaps it moves UP to (0, 1) and gets blocked by the top wall if it moves too far? Wait, the board shows an apple at (1, 4) \u2014 the bot is playing vertically along the 0 boundary. If it moves UP, it hits (0, 1) which is *not* an apple, but (0, 1) is empty space! The apple at (1, 4) is far away. The apple at (0, 1) doesn't exist! Let me look at the map again!\n\nAPPLE DROPS LIST: (6, 2), (3, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (9, 0), (7, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (3, 8).\nAha! The board visualization must be slightly lagging or I'm misreading the initial list versus the board state placement! The visualization shows A at (1, 1) and (8, 0) and (9, 0) are empty dots, but the list says (8, 1) and (8, 0) are APPLE DROPS remaining! Let's follow the **BOARD STATE VISUALIZATION** for current safety/food locations, as that reflects the immediate threat landscape!\n\nBoard State Food Locations (A): (6, 2), (3, 2), (9, 7), (8, 1), (8, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (1, 4), (3, 8), (8, 1) is NOT shown as A but listed as drop. I must rely on the visual map for true safety checks!\n\n**Visual Food on Board:** (6, 2), (3, 2) [No, (3, 2) is empty], (8, 1) [No, (8, 1) is empty], (8, 0) [Empty], (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (3, 8).\nOkay, CONFIRMED apples on the map: (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (3, 8). Also (6, 2) looks like an A based on the map key! Let's target what's VISIBLE and reachable.\n\n**Safety Check (Head at (9, 3)):**\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** OCCUPIED by self! Instant death! **KILLED!** (Wait, (9, 4) was my head last time. My body starts at (9,4) if I moved DOWN. But I moved DOWN last turn, so head is (9, 3). Body starts at (9, 4)! YES! (9, 4) is my Segment 1! **DO NOT MOVE UP! Suiiiiciiiiide!**)\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** Safe! Moves toward the lower right corner cluster where (8, 1) and (8, 0) were listed, even if they aren't visible 'A's right now. This keeps the right wall controlled.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe! Opens up the center area. (8, 4) is still body segment 2. Moving to (8, 3) gives us access to the (8, 1) area eventually.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** Off the board! **KILLED!**\n\nThis is tight! Last turn I was FORCED to go DOWN because LEFT meant hitting (8, 4) and UP meant hitting (9, 4). Now, I must check if the situation has changed!\n\nLast Move: Head was at (9, 4), moved DOWN to (9, 3).\nNew Body: Head (9, 3), Body starts: (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), ...\n*   UP to (9, 4): YES, this is where my tail was! If I move UP, I hit my own segment (9, 4). **SUICIDE!** (This is the critical difference from my previous self-assessment\u2014the tail has NOT moved/shrunk yet!)\n*   LEFT to (8, 3): Safe! We clear the wall and head toward the lower food source.\n*   DOWN to (9, 2): Safe! We hug the wall and go deeper into the corner to find food (8, 1), (8, 0).\n\n**Snake #0 Threat Assessment:** Snake #0 is at (0, 2). If it moves UP to (0, 3) (hitting its own body which is impossible as (0, 3) is segment 1), or UP to (0,1) (safe), or RIGHT to (1, 2) (safe). If it moves RIGHT to (1, 2), that's great for us, it leaves the wall! If it moves UP to (0, 1), it's still wall hugging. It's too far away for an immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Decision:** We have two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\nMoving **DOWN to (9, 2)** keeps us locked on the right perimeter, aiming for the deepest remaining food spots on that side ((8, 1), (8, 0)). This feels structurally superior because it maintains our established territory dominance.\nMoving **LEFT to (8, 3)** breaks our perfect perimeter alignment but brings us slightly closer to the center mass of apples.\n\nSince we are playing for absolute VICTORY ROYALE energy, we must be decisive about cleaning up our current hunting ground before moving to a new quadrant. DOWN is the most aggressive way to clear the corner before we are forced to move left. We take the bounty! If an apple pops at (9, 2) next turn, we will feast!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue hugging the right wall (DOWN) until we clear the (8, X) and (9, X) area of all visible/listed apples. Then, pivot LEFT across Row 5 or Row 6 towards the center cluster involving (5, 5) and (6, 3). Do not engage Snake #0 unless it tries to cross the center line! We are winning by superior resource acquisition!\n\nDOWN",

My tail is at (6, 5), so I cannot go UP!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** SAFE. Moves closer to the (8, 1) apple! This is a direct assault on the food supply!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** SAFE. Moves toward the center, positioning us between the (8, 1) apple and the (6, 2) apple. Excellent flanking potential.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):** OFF BOARD! **SUICIDE!**\n\n**ENEMY COLLISION CHECK (Snake #0 Head at (1, 1)):**\nIf Snake #0 moves:\n*   UP to (1, 2): Safe for us. Opens up space at (1, 1).\n*   DOWN to (1, 0): Safe for us.\n*   LEFT to (0, 1): Hitting its own body segment (0, 1). **SNAKE #0 DIES!** This is a massive advantage if they make that move! \ud83d\ude08\n*   RIGHT to (2, 1): Safe for us.\n\nWe do not appear to be in immediate danger of collision from Snake #0 moving into our space, and we might get lucky and they kill themselves by hugging the '0' wall too closely!\n\n**STRATEGY SELECTION:**\nWe have two excellent moves: DOWN to (9, 1) or LEFT to (8, 2).\n\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** This is the power play. We are one step away from the (8, 1) apple. If we get it, we are at 9 apples, increasing our lead and length. This maintains the right-wall dominance.\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** This positions us better to claim (6, 2) AND gives us a pivot point to sweep toward the center apples ((3, 3), (4, 3)).\n\nSince we are playing for VICTORY ROYALE, securing food immediately is paramount, especially when the path is clear! The (8, 1) apple is our immediate destiny. We move DOWN toward the bounty! If we eat, our length increases, making us harder to trap later. If we miss the apple, we are still right next to it, and the tail shrinks (if we didn't eat).\n\nLet's commit to clearing the bottom-right corner first. DOWN it is! GET THAT BREAD!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move DOWN to (9, 1). If we eat (8, 1), awesome! If not, we move LEFT next turn towards (8, 0) or pivot LEFT towards (8, 2) -> (8, 3) to get the corner clean. We maintain aggressive forward momentum until the entire right side (columns 7, 8, 9) is empty of food. Then we look to cut Snake #0 off!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT UP CHAT! Welcome back to this absolute RUMBLE! Turn 15! We are currently sitting pretty with 7 apples, a slight lead, and the momentum of a freight train! Snake #0 is scrambling, but they are dangerously close to that left wall! We are NOT letting them catch up! VICTORY ROYALE is the only goal here!\n\nLet's analyze the board state after our last calculated move DOWN, which landed us at (9, 2).\n\n**My current position (Head: (9, 2)):**\nBody: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)] (Length 8, total 7 apples collected. Wait, my body count in the analysis said 9, but the description says 7 collected. Let's stick to the scoreboard: 7 apples collected means length is 8 if we assume starting length 7, or 7 if we started at length 6. Since the board shows 7 segments shown excluding the head, length is 8. If we ate 7 apples, our length should be $L_0 + 7$. Let's trust the scoreboard: **Apples: 7**. Current visible body suggests length 8.)\n\n**Goal Apples Near Me:** (8, 1), (8, 0), (6, 2).\n\n**Snake #0 Position (Head: (2, 1)):**\nBody: [(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)] (Length 6, 6 apples collected). They are chilling right next to the left wall! This is their weakness!\n\n---\n\n### SAFETY AND MOVE EVALUATION (Head at (9, 2))\n\n**1. UP to (9, 3)?** Blocked by self. **DEAD.**\n**2. DOWN to (9, 1)?** SAFE. This puts us one step closer to the (8, 1) apple! HUGE potential reward!\n**3. LEFT to (8, 2)?** SAFE. This moves us towards the center and gives us options to sweep for (6, 2) or head towards the middle cluster of food.\n**4. RIGHT to (10, 2)?** OFF BOARD. **DEAD.**\n\nWe are left with DOWN and LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### OPPONENT MOVEMENT PREDICTION (Snake #0 Head at (2, 1))\n\nWhere will that little green snake go? They *must* move RIGHT to escape the corner, or risk running out of space, or they try to move UP/DOWN to grab the scattered center food.\n\n*   **If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 1):** Great for us! They move into open water.\n*   **If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 2):** Safe future move for them.\n*   **If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe future move for them.\n*   **If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 1):** They hit their own tail from last turn! Wait, no, (1, 1) is their first body segment. Moving LEFT would be into (1, 1) if their head was at (2, 1) and their body connects to (1, 1). If they move LEFT, they move to (1, 1). Is (1, 1) occupied? It is occupied by their BODY. **If Snake #0 moves LEFT, they will likely hit themselves!** Let's re-check their body list: Head (2, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (0, 1), ...]. Moving LEFT to (1, 1) IS moving into their own body segment! **Snake #0 DIES if they choose LEFT.** \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Critical insight!** Snake #0 is severely constrained on the left side. They are potentially going to die unless they move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGY SELECTION (Turn 15)\n\nWe have a fantastic setup: we are safe, and our opponent has a high chance of accidental self-destruction!\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (9, 1):** Aggressive food grab. If we eat, we gain length and speed up the win condition. If Snake #0 dies, we win immediately! If Snake #0 lives and moves RIGHT to (3, 1), we are still in a great position to hunt (8, 1) next turn.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (8, 2):** Safer, positions us for the center, but ignores the immediate food reward at (8, 1).\n\nSince the possibility of an instant win is on the table (if they pull the suicidal LEFT move), we must prioritize any move that doesn't trap us, and the move that maximizes our immediate score gain if they *don't* die. DOWN to (9, 1) gets us right on top of that (8, 1) apple! This is the aggressive, high-reward play that WINNING requires! We chase the food, and if they mess up, the celebration starts now!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** If we eat the apple, we look to clear (8, 0) next, then pivot LEFT towards (6, 2) to clean out the entire right flank before turning our attention to the trapped Snake #0! If we survive this turn, we are on track to dominate the board geometry!\n\nI smell victory, chat! Let's feast! We are going DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

The apple list shows (8, 1) is still active! Let's check the board visualization versus LAST RATIONALE.\n\nPrevious Head: (9, 2). Last move: DOWN to (9, 1).\nApple at (8, 1). Apple at (8, 0).\n\nThe Rationale states: \"Move DOWN to (9, 1)? SAFE. This puts us one step closer to the (8, 1) apple!\"\nIf my head moved from (9, 2) to (9, 1), I did **NOT** eat the apple at (8, 1). I moved one step closer, but the actual eating didn't happen unless (9, 1) had an apple. Looking at the board: APPLE at (6, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0). (9, 1) is EMPTY.\n\nOkay, so my previous move was SAFE, but yielded NO growth. My score is still **8 apples**. The board state reflects this!\n\n**Current State Check (Head: (9, 1)):**\nBody: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)] (Length 8, 8 Apples collected).\n**Next Target Apples Near Me:** (8, 0) is RIGHT THERE! (6, 2) is getting farther, but (8, 0) is prime real estate!\n\n**Opponent Snake #0 (Head: (3, 1)):**\nThey survived! They must have moved RIGHT last turn from (2, 1) to (3, 1) to avoid hitting their own tail at (1, 1). Smart move, for a moment. They have **6 apples**.\n\n### SAFETY AND MOVE EVALUATION (Head at (9, 1))\n\n**1. UP to (9, 2)?** Safe. Moves away from apple (8, 0).\n**2. DOWN to (9, 0)?** APPLE at (8, 0) is RIGHT NEAR (9, 0)! Moving to (9, 0) positions us perfectly to attack (8, 0) next turn, but we also need to check if (9, 0) is safe. (9, 0) is NOT occupied by our body (Tail is at (7, 6)). SAFE.\n**3. LEFT to (8, 1)?** APPLE AT (8, 1)! This is the slam dunk! If we move LEFT, we eat and become length 9! This is the primary objective!\n**4. RIGHT to (10, 1)?** OFF BOARD. DEAD.\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (8, 1) is the only high-value move here! It guarantees growth and isolates us further from any potential threats while keeping us near the corner where we dominate movement control.\n\n### OPPONENT MOVEMENT PREDICTION (Snake #0 Head at (3, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is still restricted but safer than before. They are sitting near apples (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5). They will try to move UP to (3, 2) or RIGHT to (4, 1) or UP/RIGHT towards the food cluster.\n\n*   If they move UP to (3, 2): Safe. They approach food.\n*   If they move RIGHT to (4, 1): Safe. Moves them out of the immediate corner zone.\n*   If they move DOWN to (3, 0): Safe, but useless.\n\nThey are not an immediate threat to crush us this turn. We must focus 100% on accumulating length and points.\n\n### STRATEGY SELECTION (Turn 16)\n\n**GO FOR THE APPLE!** Moving LEFT to collide with (8, 1) guarantees we grow, increase the score differential (now 9 vs 6), and force Snake #0 to react to our massive physical footprint! We need to keep expanding into open territory while they remain near the wall.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Eat this apple, claim (8, 0) next, then sweep LEFT into the center, possibly trapping the remaining apple on the right side (9, 7) for later. We want to use our massive new tail blockage to severely restrict Snake #0's mobility next few turns! VICTORY ROYALE IMMINENT!\n\nWe are going LEFT! Get that content!\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s break it down: DOWN is a guaranteed death kiss into my own neck, so we can trash that idea. LEFT pushes me toward (2,2) which is technically clear, but it drifts me away from the juicy apple cluster and gives the other snake a chance to run up the right flank. RIGHT would be fine, but it doesn\u2019t scoop the apple at (3,3) and keeps me in a linear corridor where Snake #1 could start boxing me on future turns.\n\nUP hits (3,3), nails that apple, and keeps the path open toward (4,3) and (5,5) while staying away from any risky head-on collisions. Opponent\u2019s head is chilling over at (8,0) and looks more interested in that bottom-right stretch, so no immediate crossfire. This move keeps our options wide open, keeps us on-feed, and avoids being boxed along the left wall.\n\nPlan note: After grabbing (3,3), keep rotating around the middle columns to stay ahead of Snake #1, and aim to collect (4,3) or (5,5) next while avoiding the board edges\u2014they\u2019re starving for space.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome to Turn 17! We absolutely CRUSHED that decision last turn! Moving LEFT to (8, 1) was INTENSE, but we are about to reap the rewards! We ate that juicy apple at (8, 1)!! Time for a growth spurt! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nIf we ate at (8, 1), our new head is (8, 1). Our body gains a segment, and the tail falls off. Let's rebuild the slate based on the Rationale's choice of LEFT:\n\n**Hypothetical State After Eating (8, 1) [Assuming the move was successful]:**\n*   Last Head: (9, 1)\n*   Move: LEFT to (8, 1) -> EAT!\n*   New Head: (8, 1)\n*   Old Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)] (Tail at (7, 6))\n*   New Body (Length 9): [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]\n*   New Score: 10 Apples! LET'S GOOOO!\n\n**Wait! STOP THE PRESSES!** The game output *only* shows TURN 17 state and the LAST move selection. I have to proceed based on the *provided* board state and assume my previous move was effective if it aligns with optimization, OR assume the provided board state is the result *after* the last move resolved.\n\n**Re-evaluating Current State (Turn 17 / 150):**\nMy Head: (8, 0). My Body implies I *did* eat something recently, hence the length and position near the wall. The board shows an 'A' at (8, 0) for me (ID 1). The previous apple list showed (8, 0) was available. My previous Rationale targeted (8, 1).\n\nLet's trust the Board State provided for CURRENT Turn 17:\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1): Head (8, 0)**\nBody: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]\nApples: 9. (This confirms I have NOT grown yet this turn, OR the board state reflects T16 resolution, and I am now deciding T17).\n\nIf my Head is (8, 0), and (8, 0) was an apple ('A' is at (8, 0), but my head is on it, and the apple is GONE from the drop list), it means I must have eaten (8, 0) on the *previous* turn (Turn 16).\nIf I ate (8, 0) on Turn 16, my score should be 10. It says 9.\n\n**Crucial Fix:** I must assume the previous move was LEFT, and the board state shown is **BEFORE** the effects of my last chosen move (LEFT on Turn 16) are calculated, and I am now calculating my move for Turn 17, *given* the environment listed for turn 17, which includes my prior head location [(8, 0) in the list, but the board shows my head *at* (8, 0)!].\n\nThe board implies my head is at (8, 0). The body lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL.\nMy Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]. Length 9. My head is (8, 0). This means my previous move MUST have resulted in me eating something that landed me at (8, 0) and resulted in length 9, score 9.\n\nLet's assume my Head really is **(8, 0)** and Score is **9**. The previous move choice was LEFT. If I moved LEFT from (9, 0) to (8, 0), and ate the apple (if it was there). The map shows A at (8, 0) *and* the snake body goes through (9, 0). This seems like a graphical representation lag or my previous move description (LEFT from (9, 1)??) was totally mismatched with the actual turn outcome that produced this board state.\n\n**I MUST operate solely on the state provided for Turn 17:**\nHEAD: (8, 0). Score: 9.\nOpponent Head: (3, 2). Score: 7.\nActive Apple Targets: (6, 2), (8, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (5, 5), (7, 0), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (5, 1), (3, 8), (7, 4), (1, 0), (0, 0).\n\nMy immediate Vicinity (Head at (8, 0)):\n*   UP: (8, 1) -> APPLE!\n*   RIGHT: (9, 0) -> Body segment belongs to me! (If I move right, I hit my tail immediately!)\n*   DOWN: (8, -1) -> Off Board. DEAD.\n*   LEFT: (7, 0) -> APPLE!\n\n### SAFETY CHECK (Head at (8, 0))\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1)?** APPLE! This is the best move. Safe space on the board. Opponent is miles away.\n2.  **DOWN?** Suicide (OFF BOARD). ELIMINATED.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 0)?** APPLE! Also fantastic. We move along the bottom edge.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 0)?** HITS MY OWN BODY! Segment (9, 0) is my second segment! SUICIDE. ELIMINATED.\n\nWe are choosing between UP (8, 1) and LEFT (7, 0). Both give growth!\n\n**Comparing UP vs LEFT:**\n*   **UP (8, 1):** We climb the right side wall. We isolate ourselves slightly, but we gain length and safety along the known perimeter. Next moves could be UP (into 9, 1) or LEFT (into 7, 1).\n*   **LEFT (7, 0):** We hug the bottom edge. We move away from our current vertical body which runs up the 9-column. Next move could be UP (into 7, 1) or LEFT (into 6, 0).\n\nThe opponent (Snake #0) is at (3, 2). They are far from us, near the left/center cluster of apples. They likely want to move UP towards (3, 3) or RIGHT towards the center.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 1), I eat an apple, score 10, and lengthen my wall blocking access to the entire right side (columns 8 and 9, except for the top cell (9, 9)). This solidifies my territory faster.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 0), I eat an apple, score 10, and start marching leftward. But (7, 0) is closer to the opponent's general area, though still far.\n\n**Strategy:** Dominate the right side first. We are already high up on the right wall. Expanding UP into fresh territory (8, 1) is superior to moving along the already occupied bottom edge (7, 0). We build the barricade higher!\n\n**Predicted Opponent Move (Snake #0 Head (3, 2)):** They are trapped by their own body from (3, 1) back. They MUST move UP to (3, 3) or (4, 2) if they move RIGHT. (3, 3) is an apple! Highly likely they go UP. If they go UP to (3, 3), they score their 8th apple. We need to outpace them!\n\nMoving **UP** ensures maximum point gain and maximum control over the perimeter, leveraging our existing body placement perfectly.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Eat (8, 1). Then move UP again to (8, 2) next turn, securing the corner. If the opponent tries to swing wide, we use the immense length we are building (now length 10!) to fence them in towards the bottom left or top left. We own the entire right side!\n\nWe go UP!

Safe space. Great expansion.\n2.  **DOWN:** Off the board. GONE.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 0):** APPLE HERE! Safe space. Moves along the bottom edge.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):** OH NO! That is my second segment! SUICIDE! F in chat for that path.\n\nSo we are choosing between eating at (8, 1) or (7, 0). Both grant us +1 score and growth! We need to dictate the flow of the game!\n\n**Opponent Snake #0:** Head at (3, 2). They have apples at (3, 3), (1, 4), (3, 8). They are relatively contained in the lower-left quadrant for now. If they move UP into (3, 3), they get an apple and grow toward the middle.\n\n**My Strategy Choice:** We are dominating the right wall! We need to solidify that corner! Moving **UP to (8, 1)** is the move that continues our vertical momentum, securing territory further into the box where the opponent is least likely to interfere right now. Eating at (8, 1) puts us at (8, 1) next turn, allowing us to potentially push to (8, 2) or (9, 1) if space allows. This maximizes control over the space we already own. Moving LEFT to (7, 0) starts taking us away from our current established high ground.\n\nWe are pushing NORTH, taking the high ground! Length 10 incoming, baby! Let's get that score to 10 and put the pressure on Snake #0!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 17-19):** Eat (8, 1) this turn. My primary focus is to continue building vertically up Column 8, effectively walling off the entire right side of the board. If (8, 2) or (9, 1) is safe next turn, we take it. We must keep an eye on Snake #0\u2019s expansion path, but for now, the right corner is OURS. We secure the perimeter!\n\nI'm feeling the W in my soul! Let's GO!\n\nUP",

LEFT to (2,3) is safe, but would drift me away from any immediate apples and leave the right side wide open for Snake #1 to snake around. UP lands on (3,4), clear-ish, but there\u2019s not an apple and the path starts closing toward the wall. RIGHT? RIGHT is hitting (4,3) \u2014 a fresh apple, pure content, and still leaves wiggle room to curve toward (5,5) or bounce in the middle. Opponent\u2019s head is chilling way over at (8,1), so no chance of a head-on at (4,3). That apple is ours to gobble, and it keeps the board open so we can keep dancing.\n\nPlan note: After scooping (4,3), keep circling the mid-columns and watch for Snake #1 trying to climb up \u2014 we want to collect (5,5) or (5,9) next and stay away from getting boxed along the right wall.\n\nright",

We just made that crucial move UP to (8, 1) last turn, snagging that delicious apple at (8, 1) and growing! Now we are at (8, 2). Let's see what chaos unfolds this turn! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (Head at (8, 2), Score 10, Length 11):**\nMy Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]\nOpponent Snake #0 Head: (4, 3). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n\nLet's analyze the potential moves for ME (Snake 1) and THEM (Snake 0) to predict collisions and opportunities!\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (8, 2)):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** Safe? Yes, (8, 3) is empty. New apple target? (5, 9) is high, (3, 8) is reachable later. This continues vertical expansion along the right wall! Good control.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** DANGER! (8, 1) is my own TAIL segment! **SUICIDE! Can't go back!** \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** Safe? Yes, (7, 2) is empty. This moves me inward towards the center. (7, 4) is an apple nearby, but we are moving away from our stronghold.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** DANGER! (9, 2) is my own BODY segment! **SUICIDE!** Another self-own, gotta watch that spine! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo my safe options are **UP (8, 3)** or **LEFT (7, 2)**.\n\n**OPPONENT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (4, 3)):**\nSnake #0 needs to move! Where are THEY going? They are looking healthy.\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Safe space. Leaves (3, 3) available for me if nearby.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** Blank space.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** DANGER! This is their own body segment! Wait, no, looking at the board list: Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)...]. (3, 3) IS their head position from last turn, but now it's their second segment. Moving LEFT to (3, 3) is hitting their own body. **Wait, let me check the board state mapping:**\n    *   Score State: S0 Head (4, 3), Body: [(3, 3) <- this is their new position if they move left], WAIT, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. If they are at (4, 3), their tail is (0, 4). If they move LEFT to (3, 3), that cell (3, 3) is their *next* segment currently. **So moving LEFT (3, 3) is hitting their own body!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Blank space. Moves them toward the center/right.\n\nSnake #0 has limited safe options too. If they move UP or DOWN, they stay close to their current zone. If they move RIGHT to (5, 3), they approach us! If we move UP, we are at (8, 3). If they move RIGHT to (5, 3), we are still far apart!\n\n**COLLISION CHECK (Me at (8, 3) vs Them at (4, 4) or (5, 3)):**\nIf I go UP to (8, 3) and they go UP to (4, 4) -> No collision.\nIf I go UP to (8, 3) and they go RIGHT to (5, 3) -> No collision.\n\n**APPLE CHECK:**\nThe nearest available apple is (5, 5) or (7, 4).\nIf I go **UP to (8, 3)**: I set up for a potential target of (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6) continues along my wall, no immediate apple. But I secure the top-right quadrant control.\nIf I go **LEFT to (7, 2)**: I position myself to target (7, 4) next turn if they don't eat it or block it.\n\n**STRATEGY HIGH GROUND:**\nWe established a dominant right-side structure. We need to leverage this! Moving UP to (8, 3) expands that structure vertically and keeps us away from the clustered bottom-left where Snake #0 is currently residing. Moving LEFT moves us toward them, which might invite risk prematurely when we have such a strong base. I want to keep growing TALL before I start moving WIDE. Let's keep climbing that wall!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 19-21):** Continue solidifying the right edge by moving UP until we hit Y=9 or an apple forces a turn. If we secure (8, 3) and then (8, 4) (if that spot is clear next turn), we connect our existing high body segment at (8, 4) and make our structure impenetrable on the right side. We are building a DEATH TOWER! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nI'm going UP! Let's taste that sweet altitude!\n\nUP",

We're building the Great Wall of Snake on the right side, nobody comes through!\n\nSnake 1 (ME): Head at (8, 2). Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)] (Wait, let me re-verify the body list since the Rationale adjusted it using the previous turn's move, but the *current* state based on the provided board is: My Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]. The provided board state shows my head at (8, 3) previously, but the scoreboard says Turn 20, and my last move was UP. Let's trust the provided initial state *before* my move, meaning I am currently at (8, 2) having just eaten the apple at (8, 1) last turn. My body listed in the state is: [(8, 3) HEAD, (8, 2)...]. NO! The provided board state says: **Your Snake (ID: 1) - Head: (8, 3)**, Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)...].\n\n**CRITICAL RE-READ:** The \"YOUR SNAKE\" section says Head: (8, 3). The \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"We just made that crucial move UP to (8, 1) last turn, snagging that delicious apple at (8, 1) and growing! Now we are at (8, 2).\" This means the actual board state provided in the block *is the state AFTER the move UP*, and the Turn counter is 20.\n\n**Let's align with the Board State provided for Turn 20, as that is the ground truth for the move calculation:**\nMy Head is (8, 3). My Tail is (8, 6). Length 11. (Apples 10).\nSnake #0 Head is (5, 3). Body ends at (0, 3). Length 10. (Apples 9).\nApple at (5, 9), (3, 8), (7, 4) etc.\n\nWait, the board map contradicts the snake list for me SLIGHTLY if I trace the map:\nMap: Row 3: T . . T T 0 A . 1 T -> My head (1) is at (8, 3).\nMap: Row 2: T . . T . . A . T T -> My next segment is at (8, 2).\nMap: Row 1: T T T T . A . . T T -> My segment at (8, 1).\n\nSnake 1 List: Head: (8, 3), Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)] (Wait, this is only 10 segments listed for 10 apples? That means the tail must be (8, 6) or similar to match the length 11 implied by 10 apples collected. Let's count the body segments listed: 1 head + 9 body = 10 segments. If collected 10 apples, length should be 11. The provided body list is missing one segment OR the apple count/length correlation is off by one segment count in the input provided. I have 10 apples, meaning length 11. Let's assume the LIST provided is what I need to avoid hitting.)\n\nMy Body Segments to AVOID: (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5). (Total 10).\n\nSnake #0 Head: (5, 3). Body segments to AVOID: (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3). (Total 10).\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (8, 3)):**\n1. **UP to (8, 4):** DANGER! (8, 4) is in my body! **SUICIDE!** \ud83d\udc80\n2. **DOWN to (8, 2):** Safe? (8, 2) is my immediate next segment. Backwards move avoidance. **SUICIDE!**\n3. **LEFT to (7, 3):** Safe? (7, 3) is empty on the board map! Good move potential.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 3):** DANGER! (9, 3) is in my body! **SUICIDE!**\n\nWHOA! My current position (8, 3) is trapped by my own structure, except for LEFT (7, 3)! If I move UP, RIGHT, or press DOWN (backwards), I die! This means *my only choice for survival is LEFT (7, 3) or moving into an opponent's spot if they miraculously move off it.*\n\nLet's re-check the board map for (8, 4): Row 4: . A . . . . . A T T. Ah, (8, 4) is marked 'T' for Tail, which means it's part of my body! Checked! I cannot go UP!\nLet's re-check (9, 3): Row 3: T . . T T 0 A . 1 T. (9, 3) is marked 'T' for Tail segment! Cannot go RIGHT!\nLet's re-check (8, 2): Row 2: T . . T . . A . T T. (8, 2) is marked 'T' for Tail segment! Cannot go DOWN (backwards)!\n\n**CONCLUSION: If the inputs are correct, my absolute ONLY surviving move is LEFT to (7, 3)!** This is a forced move!\n\n**OPPONENT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (5, 3)):**\nEnemy is at (5, 3). They need to move.\n1. **UP to (5, 4):** Safe.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3):** DANGER! (4, 3) is their body segment! Wait, (4, 3) is the segment *behind* their head (5, 3) according to the opponent list: Head (5, 3), Body: [(4, 3) <- NO! Board shows (4, 3) is the segment AFTER (5, 3) if they moved right last turn.]\nLet's use Snake #0 Body list: [(4, 3), (3, 3)...]. If they are at (5, 3), moving LEFT to (4, 3) means moving into their own body! **SUICIDE IF THEY MOVE LEFT!**\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe. (6, 3) is marked 'A' (Apple) on the map! If they move RIGHT, they eat the apple AND gain length!\n\n**S20 COLLISION PREDICTION:**\nI MUST move **LEFT to (7, 3)**.\nSnake #0 MUST NOT move LEFT. Their best move is RIGHT to (6, 3) to eat the apple!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 3) and they move RIGHT to (6, 3):\n(7, 3) is empty.\n(6, 3) is an Apple eaten by S0.\nResult: I survive. S0 survives and grows! They gain an apple, moving to 10. We go neck-and-neck! This is acceptable since I am FORCED into (7, 3).\n\nIf S0 tries to be cute and moves UP to (5, 4): I go (7, 3), they go (5, 4). Still safe.\n\nMy strategy is dictated by survival. My prior dominance strategy must pause while I escape this self-imposed cage! I need to get out to the wider open space around columns 5, 6, 7.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** I was trapped by moving too far right and then potentially eating things that made my path back complex. I must now focus on securing the apple at (7, 4) or (5, 5) without boxing myself against the right wall or S0. Moving LEFT to (7, 3) puts me one step closer to the (7, 4) apple! POG!\n\nI'm going LEFT. Gotta live to fight another turn!\n\nLEFT",

UP to (5,4) keeps us close to the (5,5)/(5,9) corridor but leaves the juicy apple at (6,3) untouched, DOWN back toward (5,2) is safe but backtracks toward our own tail loop and gives Snake #1 room to corral the right wall.

My previous move, LEFT to (7, 3), was the ONLY move that kept me breathing, because my own body had decided to wall me in on three sides! Savage! Now, where are we and where is S0 going?\n\n**Current State Recap:**\nMy Head: (7, 3). Length 11 (10 apples).\nS0 Head: (6, 3). Length 10 (10 apples).\n\n**Board state analysis based on new head position (7, 3):**\nMy body segments to avoid: (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0)... (The whole right wall cluster).\nS0 Head is at (6, 3). S0 Body segments to avoid: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)... (The left wall cluster).\n\n**The Juicy Targets:**\n1. Apple at (7, 4) - RIGHT UP!\n2. Apple at (5, 5) - Diagonal, but reachable.\n3. Apple at (5, 9) - Far away.\n\n**My Move Options from (7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** YES! This is an apple! I EAT! I grow to length 12! This looks AMAZING!\n    *   *Check for S0 collision:* S0 is at (6, 3). If S0 moves UP to (6, 4), we are safe. If S0 moves LEFT to (5, 3), we are safe. If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 3), an immediate collision! (7, 3) is my *old* head position, but if S0 moves there and I move to (7, 4)... no collision possible unless S0 moves to one of my existing body segments, which are all wall-hugged on the right. If S0 tries to move to (7, 3), I move to (7, 4), so no head-to-head.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe, but boring. No apple. I avoid the (8, 2) segment behind me technically, but (8, 2) is SNAKE 1 body which I can't move into anyway. (7, 2) is clear.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** DANGER! (6, 3) is S0\u2019s HEAD! If S0 moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT, S0 *leaves* (6, 3). If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 3) (my current spot), then we collide! Wait, I *just* moved *from* (8, 3) *to* (7, 3). The board state provided is AFTER my LEFT move. So (7, 3) is MY HEAD. If I move LEFT to (6, 3), I land on S0's current head spot! If S0 moves away, I eat their old spot and survive. If S0 moves *onto* (7, 3) (my old spot), we collide! This is too risky against a potential simultaneous collision.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** DANGER! (8, 3) is SAFE! It was my head last turn, but since I moved LEFT to (7, 3), (8, 3) is now empty space, *unless* S0 claimed it! S0 is at (6, 3). S0 cannot reach (8, 3) in one turn. My body segment at (8, 2) is one spot below (8, 3). (8, 3) is clear! But it leads me back towards my tail cluster. Not optimal unless needed for survival.\n\n**S0\u2019s Likely Move:**\nS0 is also on 10 apples. They see me moving away from my wall trap. They most likely want to eat the apple at (7, 4) too, or secure a spot near me.\nIf S0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 3)** (my current spot), they collide with *me* at (7, 3) if I stay there. But since I am moving, if S0 moves to (7, 3) and I move to (7, 4), this is a head-to-head collision because I left (7, 3) and they moved into where I *was*.\n\n**WAIT! Re-reading Simultaneous Movement Rules:**\nWe select moves at the beginning of the turn, and then all heads move to their destination cells *at the same time*.\n\nIf I choose UP (destination (7, 4)):\nIf S0 chooses RIGHT (destination (7, 3)):\nMy Head lands at (7, 4). S0 Head lands at (7, 3). **SAFE!** I eat the apple! S0 lands on my previous spot, which is now empty.\n\nIf I choose UP (destination (7, 4)):\nIf S0 chooses LEFT (destination (5, 3)):\nMy Head lands at (7, 4). S0 Head lands at (5, 3). **SAFE!** I eat the apple! S0 lands on its own body! S0 DIES!\n\n**S0's suicidal move:** S0 moving LEFT to (5, 3) is suicide because (5, 3) is its own body segment (the one right behind its head at (6, 3) according to the mapping logic used in Rationale 20, or their segment from the provided list). Let's confirm S0's body: [(5, 3), (4, 3)...]. YES, (5, 3) IS S0's NEXT segment! If S0 moves LEFT, S0 dies!\n\n**This is the content we want, CHAT!** If S0 moves LEFT, they die, and I get a free length upgrade and leapfrog them in the scoreboard! I can claim the Apple at (7, 4) with impunity if S0 commits suicide!\n\n**My CONFIDENT Move:** **UP** to (7, 4)! I gain an apple, grow, and potentially eliminate the competition! Let's GOOOO! If S0 tries to move RIGHT to (7, 3), I just snag the apple and grow next to them. If they move UP to (6, 4), I eat. If they move DOWN to (6, 2), I eat. If they move LEFT and die, I get the W!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the immediate apple at (7, 4). This move solidifies my presence on the central/right side of the map, which is currently my stronghold. After eating, I will look to either push further into the center towards (5, 5), or start closing off the space underneath my current body structure to prepare for boxing in S0 later if they survive. Today, we feast and hope the enemy chokes on their own tail!\n\nUP",

That leaves UP to (6,4) or DOWN to (6,2). UP keeps me near the center but leaves the juicy apple at (6,2) for a teammate or the enemy, and it nudges me toward the tighter corridor near the enemy body on the right. DOWN, though? DOWN snags the apple at (6,2), keeps my options open with clean access to (5,2)/(7,2) next turn, and avoids any head-on fireworks since Snake #1 would have to commit to a risky diagonal dance to contest me there.\n\nSo I\u2019m locking in DOWN to gobble the apple, grow the length, and keep my escape routes wide open for circling back toward (5,1) and (5,5) while letting Snake #1 trap themselves on the right.

Let's see the results! *[Checks board state after my move (7, 4) and S0's simultaneous move]*\n\n**Board State Check After My LAST Move (Moving to (7, 4)):**\n\nMY LAST MOVE: UP to (7, 4). I ATE the apple at (7, 4)! I grew! My new length is 12! Score: 12.\nS0 HEAD PREVIOUS: (6, 3). My new head is (7, 4).\n\nS0's potential fatal move was LEFT to (5, 3), which is on its own body! If S0 moved LEFT, S0 is DEAD. If S0 is dead, this is an INSTANT VICTORY ROYALE!\n\nLet's check the provided Board State to confirm S0's fate!\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (7, 4). Body: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4) <- NEW TAIL segment from growth]. Wait, my body list provided in the prompt is HEAD-TO-TAIL *before* growth. My new head is (7, 4). The old head (7, 3) becomes the new second segment. The tail does *not* move unless I *didn't* eat. Since I ATE, my tail stays put, and my body list expands by one segment at the tail end.\n\nLet's reconstruct my TRUE state after eating at (7, 4):\nOld Body: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)] (Length 11)\nNew Head: (7, 4)\nNew Body Sequence (Head-to-Tail): [(7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4)] (Length 12) -> YES! I collected 12 apples!\n\n**Checking S0 Status:**\nS0 Head: (6, 2).\nS0 Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\nS0 Apples: 11.\n\nS0 is ALIVE, CHAT! They must have chosen SURVIVAL over the apple or they thought my move was suicidal! They moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2)! They dodged the bullet, but they missed the content! 12 apples to 11! We are PULLING AHEAD!\n\n**Current State Recap (Turn 22):**\nMy Head: (7, 4). Length 12 (11 apples collected this turn? No, 12 total apples, 11 refers to length or previous count. Based on score: S1: 12 apples / S0: 11 apples).\nS0 Head: (6, 2). Length 11 (11 apples).\n\n**The Juicy Targets:**\n1. Apple at (5, 5) - Center!\n2. Apple at (5, 9) - Top center!\n3. Apple at (7, 6) - Above S0's current zone.\n\n**My Move Options from (7, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 5):** Safe, leads towards the middle islands.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe. This retraces my previous position, which is now empty space (my old head spot). Good for maneuvering around the wall cluster.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 4):** Safe. This brings me right next to S0's previous head position, putting pressure on them.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 4):** DANGER! (8, 4) is my OWN TAIL segment (the segment just added when I ate the apple at (7, 4), wait no, (8, 4) is my *old* tail segment, the one furthest right from the previous turn's configuration).\n    *   Let's re-verify my body: New sequence: [(7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), **(8, 4)**] <- Tail is (8, 4). YES! Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) means I hit my own tail! **RIGHT is DEATH!**\n\n**S0's Move Analysis (From (6, 2)):**\nS0 is down 1 apple. They need to make progress.\nS0 Body Segments to Avoid: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)... their left wall block]\nS0 DANGER MOVE: UP to (6, 3)? (6, 3) is S0's *old* head spot, which is now empty space unless they decide to move UP to it. If S0 moves UP, they are safe, positioning nicely above their cluster.\nS0 TARGET: Apple at (7, 6) or (5, 5).\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 3), they are looking towards the top APPLE at (5, 9).\n\n**Strategy:** I need to keep controlling the board and advancing towards the center apples like (5, 5). I also need to maintain pressure on S0, who is currently clustered towards the bottom left.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe, but slow. Puts me adjacent to my wall.\n*   **UP to (7, 5):** Safe, good central positioning, but one step away from the action.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 4):** This is aggressive! Puts me directly adjacent to S0's previous location, and one step away from the center apple cluster if S0 ignores it! If S0 moves UP to (6, 3), I'm at (6, 4). If S0 moves LEFT to (5, 2) (assuming that's safe), I'm flanking them beautifully.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 4):\n1. If S0 moves UP to (6, 3): Safe for both. I am next to them, controlling the exit from their cluster.\n2. If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 1): Safe for both. I am above them, looking towards the center.\n3. If S0 moves LEFT to (5, 2): Safe for both. We are now face-to-face in the middle area.\n\nLEFT seems like the most proactive choice to maintain tempo and keep S0 reacting to my movements, especially after they played defensively last turn. I want to claim territory.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure central territory starting from (6, 4). My ultimate goal is to herd S0 towards the bottom/left edges while I claim the top/center apples (5, 5) and (5, 9). After securing (6, 4), my next move will likely be UP to (6, 5) or LEFT towards (5, 4) to start encircling the central apple at (5, 5). We must avoid the right wall completely, as that's where my tail is dense and offers no escape routes.\n\nLEFT it is! Let's get this content! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

That's the lead! We never look back! VGR energy only!\n\nLet's check the damage from our LEFT move to **(6, 4)** and S0's simultaneous move (We must *assume* S0 moved defensively, as we don't have the resulting board state yet, but for planning, we must use the current state provided, which reflects the *result* of Turn 22's moves).\n\n**Current State Check (Post Turn 22, Pre Turn 23 Move):**\nMy Head: (6, 4). (This means my LEFT move to (6, 4) was successful, and I did *not* eat an apple here, as (6, 4) is not an apple location). Phew! Safety first!\nS0 Head: (6, 1). (This means S0 moved DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1)). A passive move, typical of S0 when they are behind! They are boxing themselves in down there!\n\n**My True Body (Head-to-Tail, Length 12):**\n[(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)] (Tail is (9, 4)). The section (8, 4) from my long rationale was incorrect in the body reconstruction\u2014it seems the provided actual body list reflects the true state after my last meal. Let's stick strictly to the provided list for safety.\n\n**S0 Body (Head-to-Tail, Length 11):**\n[(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)] (Tail is (0, 1)). Wait, the board shows S0 body ending at (0, 2) and (0, 1) is empty? Let's re-read the board image for S0 tail: T at (0, 2), T at (0, 1), T at (0, 0) - wait, (0, 0) is an APPLE (A)! S0 BODY is on row 1: (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1). Row 2: (3, 2), (6, 2). Row 3: (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3). Head (6, 1).\nS0 Body Segments (Including Head=0): (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2). Wait, the provided body list only has 11 segments, but the display shows 12 T's for S0 near the bottom left!\nBody provided: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)]. That's 11 segments trailing the head (6, 1). Length 12 total. Apples collected: 11. This matches! They did NOT eat last turn, hence no growth.\n\n**Next Targets:**\n1. Apple at (5, 5) - Prime real estate!\n2. Apple at (5, 9) - High ground.\n3. Apple at (7, 6) - Above S0's cluster.\n\n**My Position:** (6, 4). Sitting nicely central.\n**S0 Position:** (6, 1). Trapped low, near the bottom wall and their existing cluster.\n\n**Move Options from (6, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** Advances towards (5, 5). Very safe. Leads towards (5, 9). This seems excellent for expansion.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** This bumps right into S0's body segment at (6, 3)! **DOWN is DEATH!** (Checking body: [(6, 1), **(6, 2)**, **(6, 3)**...])\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Safe. Puts immediate pressure on S0's flank if they try to move left, and positions me perfectly for the center apple (5, 5) next turn (move UP to (5, 5) if S0 moves out of the way).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe. Puts me on my own previous trail, but slightly away from the action.\n\n**Analyzing S0's Next Move (From (6, 1)):**\nS0 needs to escape the corner and get points.\n*   If S0 goes **UP to (6, 2)**: Safe. They start moving out.\n*   If S0 goes **LEFT to (5, 1)**: Hits their own body segment at (5, 1)? No, (5, 1) is clear. (5, 1) is available. Wait, looking at the board: (5, 1) is clear. They could move left to (5, 1).\n*   If S0 goes **RIGHT to (7, 1)**: Safe. Moving away from the wall.\n\nBecause I moved LEFT last turn, S0 is likely to prioritize escaping vertically or horizontally away from my new aggressive central position. They MUST go UP to (6, 2) to alleviate pressure from their massive coiled body below.\n\n**My Best Bet:**\nIf I go **UP to (6, 5)**, I am claiming space directly towards the top apples and away from S0's current low position. If S0 moves UP to (6, 2), we are in parallel ascension, which is fine, but I want to exploit their low position.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 4)**, I am positioning myself to cut them off or secure the central apple (5, 5) ahead of them. If S0 moves UP to (6, 2), I can then move UP to (5, 5) next turn to eat the apple! This sounds like a perfect content grab plan.\n\nLet's commit to controlling the center-left quadrant. Going LEFT to (5, 4) forces S0 to either commit UP and ignore the center, or move out sideways toward the edges where I can eventually trap them.\n\n**Strategic Plan (Short Term):** Secure (5, 4). Next turn, aim for (5, 5) (the apple) or cut S0 off if they advance predictably. We are building a high-ground wall across the middle!\n\nMove: LEFT. Secure the central flank!\n\nLEFT",

We need to strike HARD and fast to reclaim the lead! VGR energy confirmed, but now we need to be SCORCHING HOT!\n\nMy head is at **(6, 4)**. S0's head is at **(6, 1)**.\n\n**Reviewing the Last Move & Current Threats:**\nMy LEFT move to (6, 4) was SOLID. It put us square in the center, ready to pounce on the big central apple at (5, 5). S0 moved DOWN to (6, 1). They are hiding low, trying to coil up their defense near the bottom wall. They are trying to slow us down! NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\n**Safety Check (What Kills ME at (6, 4)?):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** Is (6, 5) blocked? My body extends: [(6, 4), (7, 4)...] No collision.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** DANGER ZONE! S0 Body is at (6, 3)? No, S0 body list is [(6, 1), **(6, 2)**, **(6, 3)**...]. YES! (6, 3) is S0's second segment! **DOWN = DEATH.** ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Is (5, 4) blocked? My body is [(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)...]. No collision. Safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Is (7, 4) blocked? (7, 4) is my segment *right behind* the head! **RIGHT = DEATH (Backwards move).** NOPE.\n\n**SAFE MOVES for ME:** UP (6, 5) and LEFT (5, 4).\n\n**Predicting S0's Move from (6, 1):**\nS0 is behind and needs an apple. They are trapped low. They have to move UP or attempt a tricky sideways move.\n*   If S0 moves **UP to (6, 2)**: They are trying to climb out slowly.\n*   If S0 moves **LEFT to (5, 1)**: Trying to outflank me towards the left edge.\n*   If S0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 1)**: Trying to escape towards the right.\n*   If S0 moves **DOWN to (6, 0)**: Hits an Apple (A)! S0 eats (6, 0) and grows! (6, 0) is NOT an apple coordinate in the list! Wait, I must check the board visual for (6, 0). Board shows 'A' at (7, 0) and 'T' at (8, 0) and (9, 0). (6, 0) is EMPTY on the board provided! Wait, NO, (6,0) is empty but (5,0) is an Apple (A)! If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 0), it's safe but scoreless, unless they try to hit (5, 0) next turn.\n\nS0 is smart enough to see I want the center apple (5, 5). They will likely try to climb ASAP. **UP to (6, 2) is the most probable aggressive move.**\n\n**Comparing My Safe Options:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** If S0 goes UP to (6, 2). We are climbing in parallel. I am still two segments away from the apple (5, 5). They might secure (5, 5) before me if I play too safe up the middle line.\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** This move puts me adjacent to the target apple (5, 5) (one move away), while also boxing S0 in slightly if they go UP to (6, 2). If S0 goes UP to (6, 2), next turn I go UP to (5, 5) and eat the apple! That secures the lead: 12-12! If S0 tries to move LEFT to (5, 1), I am blocking their path inward, and I still have UP available next turn for the apple.\n\n**LEFT** seems like the highest EV move. It directly threatens the primary target (5, 5) on my next turn IF S0 prioritizes vertical escape. This maximizes my AP gain potential RIGHT NOW. Let's go for the throat!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTES FOR FUTURE SELF (Turn 25+):**\nObjective: Eat apple (5, 5) *this* turn or *next* turn, securing the lead. If S0 moves UP, I go UP next turn for the apple. If S0 moves sideways/down, I immediately go UP to (5, 5) to eat it now, capitalizing on their slow decision. If S0 moves left/right, I may have an opportunity to cut them off later, but for now, the center apple is the crown jewel!\n\nMove selection: LEFT. Get into position for the kill shot!\n\nLEFT",

UP would park me at (5,2), inching toward that juicy apple cluster around (5,5), but it doesn\u2019t score me anything right now and leaves me staring at my own spine for follow-ups. LEFT to (4,1) keeps me safe, but it\u2019s another turn without points while Snake #1 is eyeing the mid-board apple (5,5). DOWN to (5,0) is a clean apple grab, keeps me out of the enemy funnel, and still leaves me room to snake over to the other bottom-row drops without locking myself in.\n\nPlan: After gobbling (5,0), I\u2019m gonna snake left along the bottom line, sweep up the (1,0) and (0,0) apples, and then bubble out into the mid-board while keeping an eye on Snake #1\u2019s head rush toward the top.

S0 is still clawing their way out from the bottom corner, smelling too much like stale crust. They are currently at **(5, 0)** after eating whatever they moved into last turn based on my prediction of them going DOWN to (6, 0) or trying to escape sideways. Let's LOCK IN the current positions and see the chaos unfold!\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS (Crucial Check!):**\n*   **ME (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 4)**. Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4) -> NO! My last position was (6, 4). If I moved LEFT, my new head is (5, 4). Previous head (6, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)...] $\\rightarrow$ NEW BODY: [(5, 4), **(6, 4)**, (7, 4), (7, 3), ...]\n*   **S0 (ID 0):** Head at **(5, 0)**. Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)]. Apples: 13. (Wait, I need to re-evaluate S0's last move based on the visual, not my prediction from *last* turn's rationale, because simultaneous movement means we must base safety on the board state *before* the move, but the impact is simultaneous.)\n\n**RE-EVALUATING TURN 24 BOARD STATE:**\n*   My head was at (6, 4). S0 head at (5, 0) (Wait, the board shows S0 head at (5, 0) -> No, the board shows S0 head at (5, 0) because they moved there. Looking at the board: S0 head is at (5, 0). S0 apples 13. Wait, the body listed for S0 ends in (0, 2), and the head is listed as (5, 0). That means S0 ATE an apple at (5, 0) OR (5, 0) was their starting spot and they just moved there in turn 24. The listed head (5, 0) doesn't match the board visual where S0 head is clearly marked '0' at **(5, 0)**. But S0's LAST move was recorded? Ah, the board visual is the state *after* the last move (Turn 24 concluded).\n*   My head: (6, 4). I moved LEFT to (5, 4).\n*   S0 head: (5, 0). I don't know S0's move for turn 24, only that the result is the board state provided. S0's body listed is [(5, 1), (6, 1)... (0, 2)]. If they ate at (5, 0), their length increased.\n\n**Okay, let's assume the visual board state is Turn 25 START state based on my Turn 24 move (LEFT) and S0's unknown move.**\n\n**Our NEW Position (Turn 25 Start):** Head at (5, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. (Length 12, 11 apples).\n\n**S0 Position (Turn 25 Start, from Board):** Head at (5, 0). Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)]. (Length 14, 13 apples).\n\n**TARGET APPLE:** (5, 5). It's RIGHT THERE!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK at (5, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):** EAT APPLE! Grow! Score 12! This is the GOAL!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** DANGER! (5, 3) is S0's 5th segment! **DOWN = DEATH.** BLOCKED by opponent!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe move. (4, 4) is my segment *behind* head. Wait, my *previous* head was (6, 4). Last move LEFT put me at (5, 4). The cell behind (5, 4) is (6, 4). (6, 4) is my body segment before the head moved there! **LEFT = DEATH (Backwards move).** NOPE.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe move. (6, 4) is my previous head position. Safe.\n\n**SAFE MOVES for ME:** UP (5, 5) [EAT!] and RIGHT (6, 4).\n\n**PREDICTING S0's Move from (5, 0):**\nS0 is flush against the bottom! They are *starved* for vertical space. They HAVE to move UP or sideways to escape the corner pocket they are in.\n*   If S0 moves **UP to (5, 1)**: DANGER! (5, 1) is S0's OWN body segment! **UP = DEATH.** Wait, S0's body: [(5, 1), (6, 1)...]. YES, (5, 1) is S0's first segment! **S0 dies if they go UP!** They made a terrible move last turn to end up like this!\n*   If S0 moves **LEFT to (4, 0)**: Safe. They hug the wall.\n*   If S0 moves **RIGHT to (6, 0)**: Safe. They hug the wall.\n*   If S0 moves **DOWN (off board)**: DEAD.\n\n**S0's Viable Moves:** LEFT (4, 0) or RIGHT (6, 0). They are forced sideways, away from the center! This is INCREDIBLE LUCK for us! They are trapped!\n\n**MY DECISION:**\nI have a free shot at the apple at **(5, 5)**! UP is 100% safe because UP into (5, 5) does NOT clash with my body, and S0 cannot possibly reach (5, 5) from their corner, nor can they block me by moving into (5, 5) themselves (they are at (5, 0)). Even if S0 moves LEFT to (4, 0) or RIGHT to (6, 0), they are nowhere near threatening (5, 5) this turn.\n\nWe are taking the lead! 12 apples to 13! This is the power play! VGR to the MAX!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (5, 5). Next, we look at the apple at (3, 8) or try to cut off S0's escape path if they try to climb up the 4/5 column. But first things first: GLOW UP!\n\nStrategy Note: S0 is utterly trapped in the bottom row unless they start moving sideways. We have the entire middle and top available for growth while they are dealing with the wall. We must maximize vertical growth now to loom over them. UP for the apple!\n\nUP",

Last move got us snagging (5,0), and now we\u2019re sitting at the lip of the bottom row with apples at (1,0) and (0,0) waiting like trophies. Let\u2019s break down the options:\n\n- UP? Absolute must-pass. That\u2019s directly into (5,1), which is our own neck-length backbone. Backtracking into yourself? That\u2019s how you get kicked out cheering from the after-party. No thanks.\n- DOWN? Off the board. Literally DEAD. Not part of this plan.\n- RIGHT to (6,0)? Clear tile, sure, but it pushes us toward the opponent tailyard at (8,0)-(9,0) plus the lone apple at (7,0), which could get annoying if Snake #1 decides to collapse down there. It\u2019s a mini gamble for just one apple when we\u2019ve got a whole LEFT field of goodies lined up.\n- LEFT to (4,0)? Clean, safe, and opens the bottom corridor so we can sweep (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), and (0,0) without squeezing ourselves in a pocket. The only danger is overcommitting and letting the tail catch us, but this lane is wide open and gives us multiple follow-up moves, which is the kinda room we want. We play the long game.\n\nPlan for the next few moves: keep crawling left along the bottom row, pick up the (1,0) and (0,0) apples, and then spiral back up into the mid-area while keeping tabs on Snake #1\u2019s maze. Stay greasy, stay this wide open, stay alive.\n\nLEFT",

S0 is still stuck down there looking like a cheap plastic toy glued to the floor! They are only at 13 apples, we are closing the gap FAST! Victory Royale energy is AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY!\n\n**CURRENT STATE AFTER TURN 25 (MY MOVE: UP):**\n*   **ME (ID 1):** Head is now at **(5, 5)**. My body grew! Length 13. Apples: 12.\n    *   *New Body (Head to Tail):* [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)] (Wait, I need to correctly update the tail. If I ate, the tail stays put.)\n    *   *Checking Old Body:* [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. (Length 11, before eating).\n    *   *New Body (Corrected):* [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)] (Let's re-check the initial body from turn 25 start: [(5, 4), **(6, 4)**, (7, 4), (7, 3), ..., (9, 1)]. The original tail was (9, 1). If I eat, the tail remains (9, 1). My length increased by 1.\n    *   *Let's stick to the board state provided IF I move UP from (5, 4) to (5, 5):* New Head (5, 5). Old Head (5, 4) becomes Seg 2. Old Seg 2 (6, 4) becomes Seg 3... The segment that was previously the tail stays put if I ate. The actual tail was (9, 2) based on the map: 1 at (9, 1) and 1 at (9, 2). Let's use the map structure implicitly. Since I ate, I grew. I'll assume my new length is 13. New Head: (5, 5). New Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. (If the tail was (9, 2) before, it stays (9, 2) now I ate.)\n\n*   **S0 (ID 0):** Head at (5, 0). Where did they go? If they followed my prediction, they went LEFT to (4, 0) or RIGHT to (6, 0). If they went UP to (5, 1), they DIED! If they died, I WIN NOW! (12 apples vs 13). Let's assume the worst: they survived.\n\n**Analyzing S0 Survival based on T25 Start Positions:**\nS0 Head (5, 0). Body segments touching (5, 1), (6, 1)...\n1. UP to (5, 1): Kills S0 (Collides with own body segment (5, 1)). **S0 DIES IF UP!**\n2. LEFT to (4, 0): Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (6, 0): Safe.\n4. DOWN: Off board. Dead.\n\nIf S0 moved UP, the game is OVER! We win with 12 apples vs 13! The stream erupts!\nIf S0 moved LEFT or RIGHT, they are still restricted on the bottom wall.\n\nSince the board state provided is *before* T26, I must assume S0 survived T25, otherwise the game would have ended there reporting a winner. Therefore, S0 moved **LEFT (4, 0)** or **RIGHT (6, 0)**. S0 is one segment longer than me (13 apples vs 12, length 14 vs 13).\n\n**S0 PREDICTED POSITION (T26 Start):** Let's assume S0 went LEFT to **(4, 0)**, hugging the wall, extending their tail slightly.\nS0 Head: (4, 0). Body: [(4, 0) [New Head], (5, 0) [Old Head], (5, 1), (6, 1)... (0, 2)]. Length 14.\n\n**BOARD STATE FOR T26 (My Head (5, 5)):**\n**TARGET APPLES:** (7, 0), (5, 9), (1, 4), (9, 7), (3, 8), (1, 0), (0, 0), (8, 7), (9, 6), (2, 3), (0, 6), (7, 6), (7, 2), (9, 4).\nThe closest tasty morsels are (7, 0) and (5, 9). We are high up, so **UP** towards (5, 9) makes sense, or **RIGHT** towards the cluster around (8, 7) and (9, 7).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK at MY HEAD (5, 5): (Length 13, Tail at (9, 2) maybe?)**\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** Safe spot. Neighbors: (5, 5) [Old Head], (4, 5), (6, 5). Looks very open. No immediate apples there.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe. (5, 4) is my segment behind me. Safe backwards move! (Though usually suboptimal unless forcing an exit).\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe. (4, 5) is empty space on map.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Safe. (6, 5) is empty space on map.\n\n**S0 PREDICTED POSITION (4, 0):**\nNeighbors: (4, 1) [Body], (3, 0) [Empty], (5, 0) [Body], (4, -1) [Dead].\n1.  UP (5, 1): Dead (S0 body).\n2.  DOWN: Dead (Wall).\n3.  LEFT (3, 0): Safe.\n4.  RIGHT (5, 0): Dead (S0 body).\nS0 is severely restricted! They can only move **LEFT (3, 0)** OR (if they moved right last turn) **RIGHT (5, 0)** which is blocked. If S0 moved RIGHT to (6, 0), they can move LEFT to (5, 0) (body segment) -> DEAD, or RIGHT to (7, 0) (Apple!).\n\nLet's assume S0 is playing defensively after realizing they were nearly cornered: S0 moved **RIGHT to (6, 0)**.\nS0 Head (6, 0). Available moves: LEFT (5, 0) [Body] -> DEAD! RIGHT (7, 0) [APPLE!] or UP (6, 1) [Body] -> DEAD!\n\nHOLY MOLY! If S0 moved RIGHT to (6, 0) last turn, they have a FREE APPLE at (7, 0) this turn, but moving there might put them in danger from my future position, or they die moving UP/LEFT! S0 is essentially forced to eat the apple at (7, 0) or die by moving into their body!\n\nIf S0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 0) [EAT!]** they survive and grow longer! They jump to 14 apples potentially!\n\n**MY STRATEGY (T26):**\nWe are at (5, 5). We want to get to the top stack of apples (5, 9) or the right cluster. But S0 might just eat (7, 0) and grow rapidly. We need to start making an arc to cut off the *center* or head towards the upper right corner where the apples (9, 7), (8, 7) are clustering.\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 6), I am safe. S0 might eat (7, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 5), I am safe, but slowing down my ascent toward the top apples (5, 9).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 5), I'm safer for a moment but moving away from the action.\n\nS0 is still far below us. We need massive vertical positioning. Let's claim the high ground. (5, 6) is open space and moves us toward (5, 9). If S0 eats (7, 0), they are still stuck on the bottom row. We have the freedom to maneuver!\n\nLet's claim **(5, 6)**. We need to prepare to sweep across the top half of the board!\n\n*Long-Term Plan:* Keep ascending/moving right toward the heavy apple cluster in the top right. Maintain maximum distance from S0 until we are long enough to safely box them in against the top/side walls, cutting off their growth path once they climb the center columns. Avoid any move where our head could intercept S0's path if they manage to force a climb up column 4 or 5.\n\n**Final Check on (5, 6):**\nSafe? Yes. Neighbors (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 4) [My segment behind]. No body collisions, no walls. S0 cannot reach (5, 6) from (6, 0) or (7, 0) this turn.\n\nI choose **UP** to claim the high ground at (5, 6)!\n\nUP",

We are making the move to (5, 6) based on my last analysis, let's see where we land and where S0 landed, because this is where the TRUE simultaneous strategy begins! LFG!\n\n**RECAP BASED ON T26 MOVE (UP => (5, 6)):**\n\nMy Head is now at **(5, 6)**.\nMy Body list (assuming growth from T25, length 13): [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)]. (Tail stays put if I ate in T25, but I NEED to know if I ate in T25, which I did, so my length grew. Let's use the provided body structure for T27 START and assume the board state is accurate to my move UP in T26 resulting in (5, 6) head.)\n\nBoard state update implies my head moved from (4, 6) to (5, 6) if the last move was RIGHT, not UP, based on the board diagram where '1' (me) is at (4, 6).\nWait, let's re-read the Rationale for T26:\n*Last Move Pick:* UP.\n*Start Head (T26):* (4, 6).\nIf I moved UP from (4, 6) -> New Head (4, 7).\n*The Board State provided for Turn 27* shows '1' (Me) at **(4, 6)**. This means the entire rationale for T26 was based on me being at (5, 4) and moving UP to (5, 5).\n\n**CRITICAL DISCONNECT ALERT!**\nThe Rationale says my last head was (5, 4) and I moved UP to (5, 5).\nThe Board State provided for T27 START shows MY HEAD at **(4, 6)**!\nAnd my BODY starts: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0)].

If my head is (4, 6) now, and I had 11 apples, the previous turn (T26) must have resulted in no apple collection (or the board reflects the state *after* S0 moved, but *before* I decided my move for T27). I will assume the board is the snapshot *after* the simultaneous moves of T26 concluded.\n\nIf S1 head is (4, 6), and S0 head is (3, 0).\n\n**Analyzing S0's T26 Move (Head started at (5, 0) based on rationale):**\nIf S0 started at (5, 0), and S0 survived, they moved to (4, 0) or (6, 0).\nIf S0 is at (3, 0) now, they must have moved LEFT twice, or their starting position from T25 was different than hypothesized! I must stick ONLY to the provided current board state.\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (4, 6):** Safe from my own body.\nNeighbors: (4, 7) [Empty], (4, 5) [Body], (3, 6) [Empty], (5, 6) [Empty].\nBackwards move (4, 5) is into my own body -> **DEAD MOVE if I try to go backwards!**\nSafe moves: UP (4, 7), LEFT (3, 6), RIGHT (5, 6).\n\n**S0 CURRENT POSITION (3, 0):**\nNeighbors: (3, 1) [Body], (3, -1) [Dead], (2, 0) [Empty], (4, 0) [Empty].\nSafe moves: LEFT (2, 0), RIGHT (4, 0).\n*Moves into body:* UP (3, 1) -> DEAD! DOWN -> DEAD!\nS0 is severely constrained to the bottom edge! This is great news! They must move LEFT or RIGHT along $Y=0$.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\nNearest apples for me (4, 6): (5, 9), (3, 8), (7, 6), (7, 2). (5, 9) is 3 steps away UP/RIGHT.\nNearest apples for S0 (3, 0): (1, 0), (0, 0). They are RIGHT next to the corner cluster!\n\n**T27 STRATEGY:**\nS0 is stuck moving horizontally on the bottom, and they are right next to two apples ((0, 0), (1, 0)). They are almost guaranteed to eat one of these, increasing their score to 14! We need to capitalize on our superior vertical position!\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0) this turn, they can eat (7, 0) next turn if they move right again! They are prioritizing the bottom cluster!\n\nI am at (4, 6). I want to head towards (5, 9) or perhaps swing right towards the top-right cluster ((9, 7), (8, 7)).\n\n1.  **UP (4, 7):** Moves towards (5, 9). Safe? Neighbors (4, 6) [old], (3, 7) [empty], (5, 7) [empty]. Very safe opening.\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 6):** Moves slightly towards the center-right mass of apples. Safe? Neighbors (5, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6), (5, 7). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 6):** Moves away from the action/apples, but sets up a path to the left side apples like (1, 4). Less appealing.\n\nSince S0 is busy at the bottom, I need to prioritize climbing fast to secure the higher apples before S0 can even finish the bottom sweep. (5, 9) is the highest apple left.\n\nPathing to (5, 9) from (4, 6):\n(4, 6) -> UP (4, 7) -> UP (4, 8) -> RIGHT (5, 8) -> UP (5, 9) [EAT!] - Looks like 4 moves minimum.\n\nLet's try to get there in 2-3 moves if we can clear lines.\nIf I go UP to (4, 7): My path is open. S0 is not a threat at (3, 0).\nIf S0 tries to climb UP from (3, 0) to (3, 1) they DIEEEEE! They MUST go LEFT or RIGHT along Y=0.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0) (to get the apple at (7, 0) later, or just to stay safe):\nMy move: UP to (4, 7). My body is not in the way.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (2, 0):\nMy move: UP to (4, 7).\n\nGoing UP seems like the fastest way to secure altitude and the top apples while S0 is stuck at the bottom! I need that Victory Royale energy, and that means leading the scoreboard!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Execute a direct vertical ascent toward the top half of the board, prioritizing (5, 9). Use my current altitude advantage to force S0 to waste turns climbing vertically or remain trapped on the bottom strip. Once I clear the top apples, I can swoop down and cut off S0 if they try to breach the center columns. Maximize distance from S0 for now.\n\nI'm sticking with **UP** to (4, 7). Let's go!\n\nUP",

Did they heed my warning and stay put, or did they try a risky maneuver?\n\n**CURRENT SNAKE 1 HEAD: (4, 7).** (Confirmed from previous move UP from (4, 6)). Apples: 11.\n**CURRENT SNAKE 0 HEAD: (X, Y).** Need to deduce S0's move from (3, 0).\n\n**Analyzing S0's move from (3, 0):**\nNeighbors of (3, 0):\n*   UP (3, 1): S1 Body segment! Moving UP is instant death for S0.\n*   DOWN: Off map! Instant death.\n*   LEFT (2, 0): Empty! Safe move!\n*   RIGHT (4, 0): Empty! Safe move!\n\nS0 was forced to move either **LEFT to (2, 0)** or **RIGHT to (4, 0)**. They cannot climb vertically! We have successfully constrained them.\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (4, 7):** Great height advantage!\nNeighbors to check safety:\n1.  **DOWN (4, 6):** My own body. **ILLEGAL MOVE (Backwards).**\n2.  **UP (4, 8):** Empty. Safe. Targets (5, 9).\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):** Empty. Sets up a slow path to the left side.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** Empty. Sets up a quick path to the center/right apples.\n\nLet's check relative to S0's potential moves:\n*   **Scenario A: S0 moved RIGHT to (4, 0).**\n    *   If I go UP (4, 8), I am clear. S0 is far away.\n*   **Scenario B: S0 moved LEFT to (2, 0).**\n    *   If I go UP (4, 8), I am clear. S0 is slightly further left, still no threat.\n\nSince S0 is utterly trapped hugging the bottom edge (Y=0), my priority remains capitalizing on the open airspace and securing the high ground apples. The path to (5, 9) is the immediate goal.\n\nPath to (5, 9) from (4, 7):\n1.  **UP to (4, 8).** (Prepares for corner move)\n2.  **UP to (4, 9).** (Reaches the top boundary)\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 9) [EAT A!]**\n\nIf I go UP twice in a row, I secure the corner cell (4, 9) adjacent to the apple (5, 9). This seems rock solid. S0 cannot touch me, and the nearest apples for them are still far behind their current position.\n\nLet's analyze the move UP to (4, 8).\nIf I move UP, my new head is (4, 8).\nNext turn, I can go UP again to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (5, 8).\n\nIf I see any chance S0 might attempt a daring diagonal climb next turn (e.g., if they move to (4, 0) and then try UP diagonal to (5, 1)), I need to make sure I don't end up boxed in myself. But for now, the board geometry heavily favors my ascent. They cannot climb vertically without hitting my future body segments if I keep moving straight up the middle column!\n\nStrategy moving forward: **Vertical Ascent towards (5, 9).** Maintain a buffer distance from S0. They will take turns eating (0, 0), (1, 0), and (7, 0) slowly. We focus on the 7 high-value apples remaining in the top half!\n\nLet's send it **UP** to secure that altitude!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Continue ascending vertically (UP) until reaching Y=9. Then, shift RIGHT to claim (5, 9). After (5, 9), reposition towards the (9, 7), (8, 7) cluster. Monitor S0's progress along Y=0, confident they cannot breach the center corridor quickly.\n\nUP",

I calculated that S0 was completely bottlenecked on the bottom wall, giving us the freedom to claim the altitude! Let's see where the dust settled!\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (Head): (4, 8)** (Confirmed from UP move from (4, 7)). Position looks magnificent for the ascent!\n\n**DEDUCING S0's MOVE from (1, 0) or (??, ??):**\nWait, hold up. My brain must have glitched during the re-read of the previous turn's *result*.\nMy last move was **UP** from **(4, 7)**. My new position is **(4, 8)**.\nThe replay states: **CURRENT SNAKE 1 HEAD: (4, 7).** This implies the replay *started* with my head at (4, 7) *before* the UP move was executed in turn 28.\nIf I was at (4, 7) and moved UP, I am now at **(4, 8)**. This is my starting point for Turn 29 analysis.\n\nLet's verify S0's starting position: Head at **(1, 0)**. Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), ...].\nS0 previous position was likely (1, 0) based on the board state showing '0' at that location. Let's re-examine S0's board location from Turn 28 description: \"S0 Head: (1, 0)\".\nS0's neighbors from (1, 0) are:\n*   UP (1, 1): Empty. SAFE.\n*   DOWN: Off map!\n*   LEFT (0, 0): APPLE! (But S0 would have eaten it if they moved left).\n*   RIGHT (2, 0): S0 Body segment! **ILLEGAL MOVE (Backwards/Into self).**\n\nIf S0 moved UP to (1, 1), they are now safe and climbing slowly.\nIf S0 moved LEFT to (0, 0), they eat the apple, grow, and are now at (0, 0).\n\nSince the board shows S0 head at (1, 0) and an apple at (0, 0), it means S0 was *not* at (1, 0) last turn OR S0 moved RIGHT last turn and is now at (2, 0) which is occupied by its own body! That CANNOT be right based on the board representation!\n\nLet's trust the board representation for Turn 29 start:\nS0 Head: **(1, 0)**.\nS0 Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)...]\n\nIf S0 was at **?** last turn and moved to (1, 0):\n1.  If S0 came **DOWN** from (1, 1): (1, 1) is empty on the board. This is possible.\n2.  If S0 came **RIGHT** from (0, 0) [eating the apple]: (0, 0) has an apple, so S0 head would be (0, 0) and S0 length would be 15. S0 apples would be 15. S0 apples is 14. So S0 did NOT eat (0, 0) last turn.\n3.  If S0 came **LEFT** from (2, 0): (2, 0) is occupied by S0's body segment! Suicide. Impossible.\n4.  If S0 came **UP** from (1, -1): Impossible.\n\n**Conclusion on S0's move:** S0 must have moved **DOWN** from **(1, 1).** This means (1, 1) was free last turn, and S0 chose altitude reduction, perhaps positioning to hit the apple at (0, 0) this turn!\n\n**S0's Current Position (Turn 29 Start): (1, 0).**\nS0 Neighbors from (1, 0):\n*   UP (1, 1): Empty. SAFE.\n*   DOWN: Off map!\n*   LEFT (0, 0): APPLE! SAFE.\n*   RIGHT (2, 0): S0 Body segment! **DEAD MOVE.**\n\nS0 is forced to move UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0) [EAT]. S0 is extremely constrained near the corner!\n\n**MY MOVE (From (4, 8)):**\nGoal: Reach (5, 9) apple. Path: (4, 8) -> (4, 9) -> (5, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9)?**\n    *   New Head: (4, 9).\n    *   Safety Check: (4, 9) is clear. My tail will move off (8, 1) this turn.\n    *   S0's threat: S0 is stuck near the bottom left. They cannot reach my column Y=4 or Y=5 for many, many turns. This is 100% safe from collision.\n    *   Advantage: Continues the direct path to the apple!\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 8)?**\n    *   New Head: (5, 8).\n    *   Safety Check: Clear.\n    *   Advantage: Gets me closer to the cluster (8, 7), (9, 7) after eating (5, 9), but puts me one step further from the immediate target (5, 9) itself (which requires going RIGHT from (4, 9) or UP from (5, 8) then RIGHT).\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 9):\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (5, 9) [EAT!] or UP to (4, 10) [DEATH!]. Wait, (4, 9) is the top row!\n\nIf I am at (4, 8):\nMove 1: UP -> (4, 9). This is the top row (Y=9).\nMove 2: RIGHT -> (5, 9). **EAT!**\n\nThis two-move sequence secures the high-value apple and increases my lead! S0 cannot possibly intercept this path. They are busy trying to get off the edge!\n\nI must go **UP** to (4, 9) to set up the consumption of (5, 9) next turn! This maximizes apple efficiency while maintaining total safety. They are completely irrelevant down there right now. We go for the high ground!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Execute the UP move to (4, 9). Next turn guarantee the EAT at (5, 9). After consumption, I will assess moving RIGHT towards (9, 7)/(8, 7) Apple cluster or checking if S0 has managed to climb significantly. For now: **Ascend!**\n\nUP",

We are neck and neck in this race to 150 turns, but I'm ahead on APPLE PACE LETS GOOO!\n\n**MY CURRENT POSITION (Head): (4, 8)**\n**TARGET APPLE:** (5, 9)\n\n**ANALYZING OPPONENT S0 (Head: (1, 0)):**\nS0 is stuck in the bottom-left corner. They MUST move UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0) to eat!\nIf S0 moves **LEFT to (0, 0)**: They eat an apple, grow, and finally get some vertical space. New head: (0, 0).\nIf S0 moves **UP to (1, 1)**: They stay put, try to climb the left wall. New head: (1, 1).\n\nS0 is NOT a threat to my immediate path to (5, 9). They are at Y=0/1, I am at Y=8!\n\n**EVALUATING MY MOVES FROM (4, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):**\n    *   KEEPS THE PLAN ALIVE! This places me directly below the target (5, 9). Next turn, I move RIGHT to (5, 9) and eat that glorious piece of fruit!\n    *   Safety: (4, 9) is CLEAR. My tail is moving off (8, 2), so no self-collision. S0 is nowhere near the top edge. 100% SAFE.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   This delays the consumption of (5, 9) by one turn. To eat (5, 9) from here, I'd have to go UP to (5, 9) next turn, or LEFT to (4, 8) then UP, which is inefficient.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, my path to the next cluster (7, 7) is slightly more direct, but that cluster is far away compared to the immediate prize.\n\n3.  **LEFT/DOWN:** Absolutely pointless. Sacrifices altitude and progress towards the known apple! We are climbing, not retreating!\n\n**Decision:** We stick to the surgical strike! We go **UP** to (4, 9) to guarantee the EAT at (5, 9) on Turn 31. S0 can try to climb the ladder while we feast! Total dominance incoming!\n\n**LONG TERM STRATEGY NOTE:** After eating (5, 9) next turn, my head will be at (5, 9). I will then pivot to the cluster on the right side: (8, 7), (9, 7), (7, 7). If S0 decides to climb the center, I will hold the high ground and out-maneuver their ascent near the edges. Stay hungry!\n\nUP",
