The apple at (5, 9) is interesting and diagonal from me, but it might be harder to reach in one turn without going backward. The one at (5, 3) is further out but might be an option later.\n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (0, 7), which is on the same row as my current position but far enough away that it shouldn't interfere with my immediate moves. I could use this to my advantage and stay higher on the board for now.\n\nGiven this, I think moving **right** to position (9, 1) would be a good first move. It keeps me within range of several apples and doesn't risk running into the enemy or a wall.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT** (so NEXT_MOVE = 'R').",
