No bodies yet, so we\u2019re free to press.\n\nTHINKING OUT LOUD \u26a1\n- SAFE MOVES from (4,3): UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3), RIGHT (5,3) \u2014 all inside the 10x10 and no collisions with any body right now. No immediate danger.\n- WHAT MAKES SENSE NOW: LEFT to (3,3) eats an apple right away (apple at 3,3). That gives us +1 apple and a new head there, growing length to 2 with body at (4,3). Quick win that also starts building a small defensive \u201cbody\u201d toward future traps.\n- OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:\n  - UP to (4,4) would be safe but slower growth and gives opponent more room to maneuver.\n  - RIGHT to (5,3) edges closer to the big apple cluster near (8,3) but not as efficient for early growth.\n  - DOWN to (4,2) misses the immediate apple and keeps options open but less aggressive.\n- LONG-TERM PLAN IDEA:\n  - Get that first apple now (LEFT) to begin boxing potential and start accumulating length.\n  - Use the growing length to threaten and corral, especially around the dense apple lanes around (1\u20133,3) and (3,0)-(3,3) to limit opponent\u2019s routes.\n  - Keep an eye on Apple-heavy zones and aim to approach them while avoiding direct head-on unless we can ensure a favorable outcome by parity of turns and apples.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS (COACH NOTES)\n- After LEFT eat, reassess: push toward a corridor that edges toward the bottom-left apple cluster (near x=1\u20133, y=1\u20133) to keep opponent away from us and grow again.\n- Try to create a safe follow-up path that doesn\u2019t force a trap that could backfire; never sacrifice safety for a rash chase.\n- If the score stays tight, look for a calculated head-on only if we can guarantee we\u2019ll come out ahead in apples.\n\nDECISION: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re clearly safer pushing toward the center than looping into the top-left chaos right now.\n\nSAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n- UP to (2,5): safe. Keeps us near the center, opens vertical lines, and preserves multiple escape routes.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): safe. Starts building a cross-choke toward the middle and pressures him from a new axis.\n- LEFT to (1,4): DEAD (our own body).\n- DOWN to (2,3): DEAD (our own body).\n\nSTRATEGY INSIGHT:\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples (4 vs 2), so the goal is to force a head-on or trap him in a narrowing corridor while keeping our own options open. Moving toward the center (RIGHT) helps us threaten cross-traffic and prevents him from freely circling the edge.\n- If we flare toward UP, we tilt into a vertical play that could lure him into a chase, but it risks giving him easier lateral exits around our growing body. CENTER pressure seems safer and more punishing.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (next 2-3 moves):\n- Step into the center by moving RIGHT to (3,4). From there, we can pivot to UP or LEFT/RIGHT as apples and space open, always watching for head-on opportunities or to cut off his path.\n- Maintain at least two escape routes (one toward the left flank around x=2\u20133, one upward toward the upper zones) to avoid a trap if he goes aggressive.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE:\n- Keep building a lattice that squeezes his head toward the board edge while we stay alive.

It also avoids tightening into any potential dead-end and keeps you ready to react to his next move (likely toward the middle or to swing wide). UP or DOWN would widen the gap and reduce immediate pressure on his current neck-constraint, making a boxed-in setup slower to develop.\n\nDecision: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

It preserves strong central control, keeping multiple safe follow-ups and potential cross-plays open without inviting an immediate collision with the opponent or your own neck.\n\nWhy not LEFT? It\u2019s a solid option that nudges toward midboard flexibility, but it reduces vertical influence and might give him easier exit routes if he starts pressuring from below.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? Pushing toward the edge creates different angles but can isolate you from quick pivots and makes future chase/box-in harder if he pivots upward.\n\nShort-term plan: stay centered, react to his moves, and keep two-direction exit paths open. If he over-extends toward the edge, you can pivot to trap; otherwise stay ready to converge along the middle lanes.\n\nDecision:\nUP",

His head sits at (3,0) with a long tail creeping along the bottom row toward (7,3). Right now, we\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 7) so mobility and creeping toward safe apples is key, not reckless head-ons.\n\nSAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:\n- UP to (6,9): safe, keeps us near the top edge and closer to the apple at (9,9). But it can eke us away from pressing pressure now.\n- DOWN to (6,7): safe, keeps options open but drops us a row closer to his looming corridor, not ideal for boxing yet.\n- LEFT to (5,8): safe, brings us toward the apple at (4,8) and positions us to threaten a centripetal squeeze from the top-right quadrant.\n- RIGHT to (7,8): death. That would slam into our own neck (our neck is at (7,8)). Not happening.\n\nPLAN FOR FUTURE TURNS:\n- Take LEFT now to step into (5,8). This shaves a little space between us and the opponent while steering toward the adjacent apple at (4,8) for a clean grow next turn if safe.\n- If we eat that apple, we\u2019ll gain +1 and extend; that growth is crucial to catching up without getting boxed in.\n- After grabbing the apple, look to triangle-corner the top-left region, press toward (4,8)/(3,8) area, and attempt to shepherd him into a corner between walls and our growing tail.\n- Maintain multiple escape routes; never let the bottom-left snake trap you in a narrow corridor. If a head-on opportunity arises with a clear lead, consider it, but not while we\u2019re behind.\n\nSHORT-TERM GOAL:\n- Move LEFT this turn to (5,8), claim the nearby apple on the next safe turn if it remains, and steer toward open space while watching for a potential trap.\n\nFINAL MOVE DECISION:\nLEFT",

So all three safe moves avoid a double\u2011KO, but we still want the one that maximizes future growth.  \n\n**Apple proximity & future options**  \n- Moving **UP** puts me at (2,\u202f2).

That screams **UP** to claim the (2,\u202f2) spot, then prime the (3,\u202f2) bite next turn.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**  \n- **Turn\u202f1**: UP \u2192 (2,\u202f2) (empty, but opens the path to (3,\u202f2)).  \n- **Turn\u202f2**: RIGHT \u2192 (3,\u202f2) \u2192 eat apple, grow, now have 10 apples.  \n- **Turn\u202f3**: UP again to (3,\u202f3) \u2192 keep climbing the central column, building a vertical \u201cwall\u201d that forces the rival into a narrow lane.  \n- **Beyond**: Use the size advantage to push head\u2011on collisions when I\u2019m the bigger snake.  \n\nAlright, the move that hits all the sweet spots is\u2026  \n\nUP",

And yes, there\u2019s an apple at (2,9) and at (1,8) on the board, so LEFT will also grow us this turn.\n\nDECISION: I\u2019m taking LEFT to grab the apple at (1,8) and start pressuring the left edge for a future trap. This keeps us option-rich (we\u2019re not boxing in yet) and sets up a left-to-top squeeze while staying prepared to backflip to UP or DOWN if the enemy overcommits.\n\nPLAN (short-term to next few turns):\n- Turn 19: Move LEFT, eat the apple at (1,8), extend our neck toward the left edge.\n- Positioning goal: edge-wrap pressure with a widening \u201cV\u201d shape that nudges the enemy toward the top-left corridor. Use the left wall as a natural boundary to reduce his escape routes.\n- Maintain two safe retreat options after each move (UP to (2,9) or DOWN to (2,7)) so we don\u2019t dead-end ourselves.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s big body along the bottom; try to lure him into a head-on near the edge if the opportunity presents itself, but never sacrifice safety for speed.\n\nLonger-term note: We\u2019re behind on apples (6 vs 10), so the aim is to force a controlled box-in where he runs out of space and collides, preferably with a head-on if the positions align. We\u2019ll weave around the left/top area to create mutual traps and maximize chances of him hitting us or the wall first, while always preserving at least two escape routes.\n\nleft",

Eating now also opens a corridor toward the dense apple cluster on the right while keeping multiple exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for the next turn.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f LONG\u2011TERM NOTE: Secure the (6,5) apple, then slide left or right to hunt the nearby apples at (5,4) and (6,4) while staying aware of the opponent\u2019s potential descent. Keep the right flank open to chase (8,6)\u2013(9,6) later and use our length advantage to cut off the rival\u2019s path. Avoid heading back up into our own body and never let the tail become a trap.  \nDOWN",

Use the extended body to press the opponent toward riskier routes and set up future enclosure without gambling on a risky head-on.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES: \n- Prioritize safety and apple gain to close the gap in apples (12 vs 16). \n- Build a wall along the top-left corridor to limit Snake #1\u2019s options. \n- If a clean head-on opportunity arises with a favorable apple count, take it, but don\u2019t sacrifice safety.\n\nCURRENT GAME TEMPO: Aggressive pressure with careful growth; monitor enemy moves and avoid traps.\n\nLEFT",

My safe moves: LEFT (empty), RIGHT (empty), DOWN (apple + re\u2011orient!). DOWN not only adds a point but also makes the cell above my new head the next body segment, opening a safe UP path next turn. The rival is stuck up top; I can grow and then swoop up for a head\u2011on KO when I lead in apples. LEFT or RIGHT just drift; they don't set up that crucial upward move. So the optimal bite is DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Score 15 vs 17, gotta swing apples when safe and squeeze him tighter.\n\nFrom HEAD (0,7), SAFE options this turn:\n- UP to (0,8): SAFE. Empty, keeps top-left corridor open, no collision risk.\n- DOWN to (0,6): BAD. Currently occupied by Snake #1\u2019s body; likely death (or at least a bad trade) this turn.\n- LEFT to (-1,7): OFF BOARD. Not allowed.\n- RIGHT to (1,7): Hitting our own neck. Dead.\n\nConclusion: Only UP is safe. We keep the top-left pocket intact and threaten to push Snake #1 toward the wall.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (0,8) this turn to solidify the corridor.\n- Maintain multiple escape routes along the left edge; prevent a quick loop around us.\n- If opportunities arise (eg, Snake #1 drifts toward the wall or a safe apple lines up), pivot to force a head-on when feasible, but only if it\u2019s a clean trade with a higher chance of survival.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Survive long enough to eat safe apples and close the apple gap, then use the boxed channel to force him into the wall and squeeze him into a non-escape loop.\n- Avoid tight dead-ends that trap us; keep the spine of the left column open for future escapes.\n\nCurrent risk/score awareness:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (15 vs 17). We should prioritize safe growth and edge-control over a risky head-on right now.\n- The top-left corridor gives us a strong leash on Snake #1 and future chances to trap him without suicidal moves.\n\nResult: UP",

Next turns, look to gradually influence his retreat path with calculated turns and wall-adjacencies, while snaring safe apples only when it won\u2019t expose me to a trap.\n\nLong-term plan note: prioritize safety first, then shape the board to squeeze him toward a corner or into a mutually deadly exchange if a favorable head-on arises. Keep my own body as a moving shield, and avoid unnecessary duels while I grow the score advantage when opportunities arise.\n\nDOWN",
