No risk of head-on collision or body collision yet.\n2. **Apples reachable:** My snake can reach the following apples in one move:\n   - (5,1): Move LEFT twice (from (6,9) to (5,9) to (5,1)) or DOWN 8 times then LEFT twice (not efficient).\n   - (3,2): Move DOWN 7 times then LEFT twice (not efficient).\n   - (4,1): Move DOWN 6 times then LEFT twice (not efficient).\n   - (8,7): Move DOWN 2 times then RIGHT twice (from (6,9) to (6,7) to (8,7)).\n   - (0,8): Move LEFT 6 times then UP once (from (6,9) to (0,9) to (0,8)).\n\n   The most efficient apple to reach is (8,7) because it requires only 2 moves DOWN and 2 moves RIGHT (total 4 moves, but since we can only move one step per turn, it's 2 DOWN followed by 2 RIGHT). However, this is not immediately reachable in one turn. The closest apple is (8,7), but it's not directly adjacent to my head (6,9).\n   The apples at (4,1), (3,2), and (5,1) are in the bottom-left corner, far from my current position. The apple at (0,8) is reachable in 7 moves LEFT and 1 move UP (not efficient).\n   The apple at (8,7) is the most promising for now, but it's not directly reachable. The only apples directly reachable in one move are none, since none are adjacent to (6,9).\n\n3. **Safe Moves:** Since my snake is just the head at (6,9), I can move in any direction except RIGHT (which would take me to (7,9), but since the board is 10x10, (7,9) is still within bounds). However, moving RIGHT is safe because it's within the board.\n   Actually, all directions are safe because:\n   - UP: (6,10) \u2192 Out of bounds (invalid).\n   - DOWN: (6,8) \u2192 Valid.\n   - LEFT: (5,9) \u2192 Valid.\n   - RIGHT: (7,9) \u2192 Valid.\n\n   Moving UP is invalid because (6,10) is outside the board. So, safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n4. **Future Options:** I need to avoid getting trapped in a corner or dead-end. Moving LEFT or RIGHT keeps me in the top row, which is flexible. Moving DOWN takes me to the second row from the top, which might limit future options if I get stuck there.\n\n5. **Enemy Position:** The enemy snake is at (4,3). It's far away and not a threat yet. Its movement won't affect me immediately unless it moves toward me, but since we move simultaneously, I need to consider its possible moves.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **DOWN:** Move to (6,8).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top half of the board, closer to the apple at (8,7).\n   - Cons: Still not adjacent to any apple, but opens up more space for future movement.\n\n2. **LEFT:** Move to (5,9).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top row, which is flexible. I can still move LEFT or RIGHT in future turns.\n   - Cons: Not closer to any apple immediately.\n\n3. **RIGHT:** Move to (7,9).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top row, which is flexible. I can still move LEFT or RIGHT in future turns.\n   - Cons: Not closer to any apple immediately, but might be useful for future moves to reach (8,7) or (0,8).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since no apple is directly adjacent to my head, I should prioritize moving toward the closest apple while keeping flexibility for future moves.\n- The apple at (8,7) is the closest in terms of Manhattan distance (2 DOWN + 2 RIGHT = 4 steps). Moving DOWN first is a good start to reach it.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't immediately bring me closer to any apple, but moving DOWN does.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move DOWN to (6,8) on Turn 0.\n- On Turn 1, move DOWN again to (6,7) to get closer to (8,7).\n- On Turn 2, move RIGHT to (7,7) to get even closer to (8,7).\n- On Turn 3, move RIGHT to (8,7) to eat the apple.\n- After eating the apple, I will have a body segment at (7,7), so I need to ensure future moves don't hit my own body or get trapped.\n\n### Final Move:\nDOWN",

It doesn't collide with own body (no body exists yet).\n3. The enemy snake cannot reach (4,2) in one turn from (6,9) due to distance.\n4. This move positions the snake to eat the (4,1) apple on the next turn, then shoot for (5,1) afterward.\n\nMoving left to (3,3) is also safe and leads to the (3,2) apple, but going down is more central and facilitates access to two apples (4,1) and (5,1) efficiently. The long-term plan is to collect nearby apples quickly, then move toward the (0,8) apple while monitoring to avoid the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

Eating the apple increases our length and gives us a long-term advantage. This is the most beneficial option because it grows our snake, increasing our survivability by making it harder for enemies to hit us.\n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nEating the apple at (5,1) with the RIGHT move immediately increases our apple count to 2 and grows our snake to 3 segments. This makes us a tougher target while also positioning our head closer to potential threats and strategic positions. A larger snake also buys more time for future moves toward other apples. \n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Prioritize immediate apple acquisition to grow quickly. Maintain mid-board positioning to avoid tight spaces while scouting for next targets (e.g., (3,2), (8,7)). Be cautious of enemy movement uncertainty.\n\n### Decision:\n**RIGHT**\n\n**Final Move:** RIGHT",

Assuming it moved DOWN to (4, 1) (since (4, 2) is its tail), its new head is (4, 1) and body is [(4, 1), (4, 2)] (but this seems inconsistent; likely it moved DOWN to (3, 2) or another direction. Need to clarify: based on last turn's state, Snake #0 was at (4, 2) with body [(4, 1), (4, 2)]. If it moved DOWN, its new head would be (3, 2), and body would be [(3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)]. But (3, 2) has an apple, so it likely moved to eat it. Thus, Snake #0 is now at (3, 2) with body [(3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)], and has 3 apples (since it ate one).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Apple Priorities**:\n   - The apple at (8, 7) is now 1 step away (RIGHT from (7, 7)).\n   - Other apples are farther away, so (8, 7) remains the priority.\n   - Snake #0 is now at (3, 2) with an apple there, so it may move away or grow.\n\n2. **Safe Moves from (7, 7)**:\n   - UP: (7, 8) \u2192 Valid (within bounds).\n   - DOWN: (7, 6) \u2192 Valid.\n   - LEFT: (6, 7) \u2192 Valid.\n   - RIGHT: (8, 7) \u2192 Valid (apple here).\n   All directions are safe since no other snake or body segment is adjacent.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement**:\n   - Snake #0 is now at (3, 2) with body [(3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)]. It is not a direct threat to me, but its position is worth noting for future turns.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **UP**: Move to (7, 8).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top row, flexible for future movement.\n   - Cons: Moves away from the apple at (8, 7). No immediate advantage.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (7, 6).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the middle of the board.\n   - Cons: Moves away from (8, 7) and doesn't help me reach any apple faster.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (6, 7).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top half of the board, flexible for future movement.\n   - Cons: Moves away from (8, 7) and doesn't help me reach any apple faster.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (8, 7).\n   - Pros: Eats the apple at (8, 7), gaining 1 point and growing a body segment at (7, 7).\n   - Cons: After eating, my body will be [(7, 7), (8, 7)], so I need to ensure future moves don't trap me.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since (8, 7) is the closest apple and eating it is safe, I should prioritize moving RIGHT to eat it.\n- After eating, I will have a body segment at (7, 7), so I need to plan future moves carefully to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (8, 7) on Turn 3 to eat the apple.\n- After eating, my body will be [(7, 7), (8, 7)]. On Turn 4, I need to move away from (7, 7) to avoid hitting my own body.\n- Possible moves after eating: UP to (8, 8), DOWN to (8, 6), or LEFT to (7, 7) (invalid, as it would hit my body). So UP or DOWN are safe.\n- After moving UP or DOWN, I can then plan to reach the next closest apple.\n\n### Final Decision:\nEat the apple at (8, 7) by moving RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Positions the head toward the apple at (3,2) for future collection. Also keeps the snake in a central area, avoiding tight spaces. \n- **DOWN**: Moves to (5,0), safe but moves away from remaining apples, limiting future flexibility.\n- **LEFT**: Moves into (4,1), which is occupied by the snake\u2019s own body. Self-collision imminent\u2014invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (6,1), safe but no apple present. Moves away from accessible apples like (3,2). \n\n### Strategic Rationale:\nEating the apple at (3,2) is prioritized because it is the closest remaining apple and offers the most direct path. A RIGHT move would take the snake away from this target, while DOWN would centralize less advantageously. UP allows progress toward the apple while maintaining mid-board positioning to avoid enemy encroachment. Although no immediate apple is in adjacent cells, prioritizing UP sets up a safe two-step path toward (3,2). Growth remains a priority, and this move keeps the snake expandable for future apple acquisitions.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Progress toward (3,2) to collect the apple. Prioritize directional safety and apple proximity. Keep body positioning open to avoid segment collisions with itself or enemies. Continue to focus on incremental growth while scouting for new apples at (1,5) and (2,7) if needed.\n\n**Decision: UP**  \n**Final Move:** UP",

(2, 7) is 1 step away (LEFT from (8, 7) is not possible, but UP to (8, 8) and then LEFT to (7, 8) and DOWN to (2, 7) is too long. Actually, (2, 7) is 6 steps away diagonally, but Manhattan distance is (8-2) + (7-7) = 6. The apple at (1, 5) is 7 steps away (Manhattan distance: (8-1) + (7-5) = 7 + 2 = 9). Wait, no: (8,7) to (1,5) is |8-1| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9. So (2,7) is closer (6 steps).\n   - However, (2,7) is not directly reachable in one move. The closest apple is actually (0,8) at Manhattan distance 8 + 1 = 9, but (2,7) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (6). But since we can't move diagonally, we need to find the shortest path.\n   - The apple at (2,7) is directly above (2,6), but we're at (8,7). To reach (2,7), we'd need to move LEFT repeatedly, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, we could move UP to (8,8), then LEFT to (7,8), then DOWN to (7,7), but that's not helpful. Actually, the shortest path to (2,7) is:\n     - (8,7) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) (6 moves).\n   - The apple at (1,5) is farther away, so (2,7) is the priority.\n\n2. **Safe Moves from (8, 7)**:\n   - UP: (8, 8) \u2192 Valid (within bounds).\n   - DOWN: (8, 6) \u2192 Valid.\n   - LEFT: (7, 7) \u2192 Invalid (would hit my own body at (7,7)).\n   - RIGHT: (9, 7) \u2192 Invalid (off the board).\n   So only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement**:\n   - Snake #0 is at (3, 2) with body [(3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)]. It is not a direct threat to me, but its position is worth noting for future turns.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **UP**: Move to (8, 8).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the top row, flexible for future movement. From here, I can move LEFT to (7,8) and then DOWN to (7,7), but that doesn't help reach (2,7). Alternatively, I can move LEFT repeatedly to reach (2,8) and then DOWN to (2,7).\n   - Cons: Moves away from the apple at (2,7) in the short term, but sets up a path to reach it eventually.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (8, 6).\n   - Pros: Keeps me in the middle of the board, flexible for future movement. From here, I can move LEFT to (7,6) and then UP to (7,7), but again, this doesn't help reach (2,7) quickly.\n   - Cons: Similar to UP, but moves me farther from the top row where (2,7) is located.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since (2,7) is the closest apple, I should prioritize moves that set me up to reach it efficiently.\n- Moving UP to (8,8) allows me to then move LEFT to (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), and then DOWN to (3,7), (2,7). This is a longer path but avoids getting trapped.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,6) is less optimal for reaching (2,7) quickly.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move UP to (8,8) on Turn 4.\n- On Turn 5, move LEFT to (7,8).\n- On Turn 6, move LEFT to (6,8).\n- Continue moving LEFT until I reach (2,8), then move DOWN to (2,7) to eat the apple.\n- After eating, I will have a longer body, so I need to ensure I don't get trapped.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMove UP to (8,8) to set up a path to reach the apple at (2,7).\n\nUP",

Moving into my own body is invalid).\n   So safe moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement**:\n   - Snake #0 is at (2, 3) with body [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. It is not a direct threat to me, but its position is worth noting for future turns.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **UP**: Move to (3, 9).\n   - Pros: Moves me closer to the apple at (0, 8) by reducing the y-coordinate difference.\n   - Cons: This is not the most direct path to the apple at (2, 7). Moving UP would take me away from the optimal path to (2, 7).\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (3, 7).\n   - Pros: Moves me closer to the apple at (2, 7) by reducing the y-coordinate difference.\n   - Cons: Moving DOWN might not be the most efficient path to (2, 7) since LEFT seems more direct.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (2, 8).\n   - Pros: This is the most direct path to the apple at (2, 7). Moving LEFT reduces the x-coordinate, which is necessary to reach (2, 7).\n   - Cons: None, as it\u2019s the most efficient move toward the apple.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since LEFT is the most direct path to the apple at (2, 7), I should continue moving LEFT to (2, 8).\n- After moving to (2, 8), I can move DOWN to (2, 7) to eat the apple on the next turn.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move LEFT to (2, 8) on Turn 10.\n- On Turn 11, move DOWN to (2, 7) to eat the apple.\n- Ensure to avoid trapping myself and maintain flexibility in future moves.\n\nLEFT",

It is moving directly toward me since its head is at (2, 6) and my body is at (3, 8) and (2, 8).\n   - If I move DOWN to (2, 7) on Turn 11, Snake #0 will move to (2, 7) as well if it chooses to move UP (which is likely since it's moving toward me). This would result in a head-on collision and both snakes would die.\n\n4. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - If I move UP to (2, 9), Snake #0 would likely move UP to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 6) to avoid collision with my body. This would keep me safe but not allow me to eat the apple at (2, 7) this turn.\n   - If I move LEFT to (1, 8), Snake #0 would likely move UP to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 6). This would also keep me safe and allow me to potentially eat the apple at (2, 7) on the next turn if I move RIGHT.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **UP**: Move to (2, 9).\n   - Pros: Avoids immediate head-on collision with Snake #0.\n   - Cons: Does not eat the apple at (2, 7) this turn, and the apple at (0, 8) is still farther away.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (2, 7).\n   - Pros: Eats the apple at (2, 7) immediately.\n   - Cons: High risk of head-on collision with Snake #0 if it moves UP.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (1, 8).\n   - Pros: Avoids immediate head-on collision with Snake #0. Maintains flexibility to eat the apple at (2, 7) on the next turn.\n   - Cons: Does not eat the apple this turn, but keeps options open for future turns.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 7) is too risky due to the high chance of collision with Snake #0.\n- Moving UP to (2, 9) is safe but does not help in eating the apple at (2, 7).\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 8) is the safest option and keeps the apple at (2, 7) reachable on the next turn.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move LEFT to (1, 8) on Turn 11.\n- On Turn 12, move RIGHT to (2, 8) to eat the apple at (2, 7) if it is still there.\n- Ensure to avoid trapping myself and keep flexibility for future moves.\n\nLEFT",

It is moving away from me and not directly threatening me at the moment.\n\n4. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - If I move DOWN to (0, 7), I am closer to the apple at (0, 5) and can reach it in 2 turns (DOWN twice).\n   - If I move RIGHT to (1, 8), I am closer to the apple at (1, 5) but not as close to (0, 5).\n   - If I move UP to (0, 9), I am moving away from the apples and not optimal.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **DOWN**: Move to (0, 7).\n   - Pros: Moves me closer to the apple at (0, 5) and keeps options open.\n   - Cons: Does not eat an apple this turn.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Move to (1, 8).\n   - Pros: Keeps me flexible to reach the apple at (1, 5) next turn.\n   - Cons: Does not eat an apple this turn and moves me away from the apple at (0, 5).\n\n3. **UP**: Move to (0, 9).\n   - Pros: Avoids immediate danger.\n   - Cons: Moves me farther away from the apples.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Moving DOWN to (0, 7) is the best move as it keeps me on track to reach the apple at (0, 5) in the next few turns.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) is less optimal as it moves me away from the apple at (0, 5).\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- Move DOWN to (0, 7) on Turn 13 to position myself to reach the apple at (0, 5) on Turn 14.\n- On Turn 14, move DOWN again to (0, 6) and then DOWN to (0, 5) on Turn 15 to eat the apple.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at (1, 5) and other potential moves to ensure flexibility and avoid getting trapped.\n\nDOWN",

However, RIGHT and DOWN both lead to (1, 5), so they are equivalent in this case.\n\n3. **Enemy Movement**:\n   - Snake #0 is at (4, 9) with body [(3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6)]. It is not directly threatening me at the moment, but its head is moving toward the top-right corner.\n\n4. **Alternative Moves**:\n   - If I move DOWN or RIGHT to (1, 5), I will eat the apple and grow by 1 segment.\n   - If I move UP to (0, 6), I am moving away from the apple at (1, 5) and not optimal.\n\n### Possible Moves and Evaluation:\n1. **DOWN or RIGHT**: Move to (1, 5).\n   - Pros: Eats the apple at (1, 5), increasing my score to 4 apples and growing my snake by 1 segment.\n   - Cons: None significant; this is the optimal move.\n\n2. **UP**: Move to (0, 6).\n   - Pros: Keeps me alive.\n   - Cons: Does not eat an apple and moves me away from the closest apple.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Moving DOWN (or RIGHT) to (1, 5) is the best move as it allows me to eat the apple and increase my score.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- After eating the apple at (1, 5), my body will be [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)].\n- Next, I should consider moving toward the apple at (5, 5) or (4, 4) depending on which is more reachable and safe.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Since I can only move one cell per turn, I cannot eat it in this turn.\n- The apple at (5, 5) is the next closest, but it is too far away to be prioritized in this turn.\n\n**Safe and Optimal Move:**\n- Moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** are both safe and keep me alive.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (1, 4) is slightly better because:\n  - It allows me to move closer to the apple at (1, 5) in the next turn (RIGHT from (1, 4)).\n  - It keeps the enemy snake away from my path for now, as it is moving toward the top-right corner.\n\n**Enemy Movement:**\n- Snake #0 is moving toward the top-right corner, so it is not directly threatening me in the short term.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n1. **Turn 17 (Current)**: Move **DOWN** to (1, 4). This positions me optimally to reach the apple at (1, 5) on Turn 18.\n2. **Turn 18**: Move **RIGHT** to (1, 5) to eat the apple and grow by 1 segment.\n3. **Turn 19**: After eating the apple at (1, 5), my body will be [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)] (tail at (0, 7)). I will need to evaluate the next closest apple and safe path.\n   - Possible candidates: (5, 5), (4, 4), or (7, 9).\n   - Avoid getting trapped in the leftmost column; prioritize expanding toward the center or right side of the board.\n4. **General Strategy**:\n   - Maintain a balance between eating apples and avoiding collisions.\n   - Keep the snake's body spread out to avoid getting trapped in dead-ends.\n   - Monitor the enemy snake's movements to anticipate potential threats.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",
