There are no immediate obstacles around.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3,1) with no body.\n- Apples are at: (1,8), (1,3), (9,7), (2,0), (7,4)\n\n**Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- UP: (4,4) - currently empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (4,2) - currently empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (3,3) - currently empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,3) - currently empty, safe.\n\nAll four directions are safe since there are no bodies or walls adjacent.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe should consider moving towards an apple to start growing. The closest apples are:\n- (1,3) - distance 3 (left 3, same y)\n- (7,4) - distance 4 (right 3, up 1)\n- (2,0) - distance 5 (left 2, down 3)\n- (1,8) - distance 8 (left 3, up 5)\n- (9,7) - distance 9 (right 5, up 4)\n\nThe apple at (1,3) is the closest. To get there, we need to move left. Currently at (4,3), so moving LEFT to (3,3) gets us one step closer.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy snake is at (3,1). It might also be heading towards the apple at (1,3) or (2,0). However, we are closer to (1,3) than the enemy (which is at (3,1) - distance to (1,3) is 2 for enemy, but we are at (4,3) which is distance 3). Actually, the enemy is closer to (1,3) (Manhattan distance: enemy |3-1| + |1-3| = 2+2=4, while we are |4-1|+|3-3|=3+0=3). Wait recalc:\n- Enemy at (3,1) to (1,3): dx=2, dy=2 -> total 4.\n- We at (4,3) to (1,3): dx=3, dy=0 -> total 3.\n\nSo we are closer. But we should be cautious of head-on collisions. However, this turn we are both just heads, so if we both move to the same cell it would be a collision. But for now, moving left is safe.\n\nAlso, the apple at (1,3) is directly left from us. So moving LEFT is the most direct path.\n\nOther apples: (7,4) is also relatively close, but moving right and up would take longer.\n\nSo prioritize moving towards (1,3).\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Head towards the apple at (1,3) while avoiding the enemy. Since the enemy is at (3,1), it might move up or left. We should be cautious of potential collisions in the next turns. After eating the apple, we will have a body segment, so we need to avoid backtracking into it.\n\nFor now, move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

We still have no body (just the head).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with no body.\n- Apples are at: (1,8), (1,3), (9,7), (2,0), (7,4)\n\n**Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- UP: (3,4) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (3,2) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (2,3) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - empty, safe (but this is backtracking to our previous position? However, since we have no body, it is safe to move backwards for now).\n\nAll directions are safe since there are no obstacles.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe are at (3,3). The closest apple is still (1,3) at distance 2 (left 2). Also, (2,0) is at distance 3 (left 1, down 3) and (7,4) at distance 4 (right 4, up 1).\n\nWe should continue moving towards (1,3). Moving LEFT to (2,3) gets us closer. However, note that the enemy is at (2,1). If we move LEFT to (2,3), we are directly above the enemy. The enemy might move UP to (2,2) or (2,3) as well? But we don't know its move.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider moving DOWN to (3,2) to avoid potential conflict and go for (2,0)? But (2,0) is farther and we are closer to (1,3).\n\nSince we are both just heads, we need to avoid head-on collisions. If we both move to the same cell, both die. So we should predict the enemy's likely move.\n\nEnemy at (2,1) has apples nearby: (1,3) (distance 3: left1, up2) and (2,0) (distance 1: down1). So the enemy is very close to (2,0) - it can move DOWN to (2,0) and eat it. Alternatively, it might move UP to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,1) to get closer to (1,3).\n\nGiven that (2,0) is so close, the enemy is likely to move DOWN to (2,0) to eat it. That would be a safe move for it. So we don't expect the enemy to move to (2,3) this turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (2,3) is safe and gets us closer to (1,3). Also, if the enemy eats (2,0), it will grow and have a body next turn, but we are not in immediate danger.\n\nAnother option: if we move DOWN to (3,2), we are closer to (2,0) but the enemy is even closer. So we probably can't beat it to that apple.\n\nSo best to stick with (1,3). Move LEFT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Continue towards (1,3). After this move to (2,3), next turn we can move LEFT to (1,3) to eat it. But be cautious: the enemy might be at (2,1) with a body after eating (2,0)? But if it eats (2,0), it will have a body at (2,1) next turn. So when we move to (1,3), we are safe from the enemy's body (since it would be at (2,1)). However, if the enemy moves to (1,1) or something, it might conflict later. But for now, proceed.\n\nLEFT",

We have no body (just the head).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2,1) with a body at (2,1) (since it ate the apple at (2,0) last turn? Wait, let's check: last turn enemy head was at (2,0) and it had a body at (2,1). Now, after moving, it should have grown. But the board shows enemy head at (2,0)? Actually, the board state shows:\n   \"0 . . 1 . . . . . . .\" at row 0, meaning (2,0) is the enemy head? But the text says \"Snake #1 - Head: (2,0), Body: [(2,1)]\". So enemy head is at (2,0) and body at (2,1). It must have moved DOWN to (2,0) and eaten the apple there? Because last turn it was at (2,1) head and (2,0) body? Wait, last turn: enemy head was (2,0) and body [(2,1)]? Actually, last turn info: \"Enemy snakes: Snake #1 - Head: (2,0), Body: [(2,1)], Apples: 1\". So it already had a body. Now after moving, it has head at (2,0) and body at (2,1)? But that doesn't make sense because if it moved to (2,0) it would have eaten the apple and grown. But the board shows apple at (2,0) is gone? Actually, the board state shows at (2,0): \"1\" meaning enemy head. And apples are listed as (1,8), (1,3), (9,7), (7,4), (9,5) - so (2,0) is not an apple anymore. So enemy did eat the apple at (2,0) last turn? But last turn apples included (2,0)? Yes, last rationale mentioned \"(2,0)\" as an apple. So enemy moved DOWN to (2,0) and ate it. Now it has head at (2,0) and body at (2,1) (the old head position). And it has 2 apples? But scores say \"Snake #1 apples: 1\" - wait, it was 1 last turn, now it should be 2? But the text says \"Apples: 1\" for snake #1. This is inconsistent. Probably a mistake in the state. But we'll trust the given state: enemy has 1 apple and head at (2,0) with body at (2,1).\n\nActually, the board state shows:\nRow 0: \". . 1 . . . . . . .\" meaning at (2,0) is enemy head.\nRow 1: \". . T . . . . . . .\" meaning at (2,1) is enemy tail (body).\nSo enemy snake is: head (2,0), body [(2,1)].\n\nApples are at: (1,8), (1,3), (9,7), (7,4), (9,5)\n\nMy snake: head at (2,3), no body.\n\n**Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**\n- UP: (2,4) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty, safe.\n\nAll directions are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe are at (2,3). The closest apple is (1,3) at distance 1 (left 1). Also (1,8) is far, (9,7) and (9,5) are far, (7,4) is at (dx=5, dy=1).\n\nSo moving LEFT to (1,3) will let us eat the apple. This is very desirable.\n\nBut we must consider the enemy. Enemy is at (2,0) with body at (2,1). It can move UP to (2,1) but that is its own body? So it cannot move UP. It can move DOWN? But (2,-1) is off the board. So it can only move LEFT to (1,0) or RIGHT to (3,0). So it will not move to (1,3) this turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (1,3) is safe and we get the apple.\n\nAfter eating, we will grow: next turn we will have head at (1,3) and body at (2,3).\n\nThis is a great move.\n\nOther moves are not as good: they don't get us an apple immediately.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (1,3), we will have a body. Then we can consider moving to other apples. The enemy is trapped at the bottom? It has limited moves: only LEFT or RIGHT. So we can safely collect apples. Next, we might go for (7,4) or (9,5) or (9,7). But avoid getting trapped. Since we are small, we have many options.\n\nLEFT",

Other moves are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nThe closest apple is (0,5) at distance (dx=1, dy=2) or (7,4) at (dx=6, dy=1). Also (1,8) is above.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,3) gets us closer to (0,5).

This is efficient.\n\nMoving UP to (1,4) doesn't get us closer to any apple immediately, but opens paths.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1,2) moves away from most apples.\n\nSo LEFT seems best for the apple at (0,5).\n\nBut consider enemy: Enemy at (1,0) can move UP to (1,1), LEFT to (0,0), or RIGHT to (2,0) (which is its body). So it might move UP or LEFT. It won't interfere with us at (0,3) this turn.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (0,3), we have safe follow-ups: UP to (0,4) or DOWN to (0,2).

This is better than being stuck at (0,6) which only has RIGHT (to (1,6)) and DOWN (to (0,5) which will be my body next turn) as options.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the better move to improve my position and access more apples.\n\n**Next turn note:**\nAfter moving to (1,5), my body will be [(0,5), (0,4), (0,3)] (since I ate the apple last turn). I should continue moving rightwards or upwards towards the apples at (4,6) or (7,4). Avoid going back left to (0,5) as it is now my body.\n\nRIGHT",

It might limit future options.\n- Moving UP to (1,6): This moves me closer to the apple at (1,8) and (4,6). It also keeps me in a good position to access other apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,5): This moves me towards the center and closer to apples like (4,6) and (7,4). However, it brings me closer to the enemy at (2,3). The enemy might move UP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3), etc., but not directly threatening (2,5) this turn.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy at (2,3) can move UP to (2,4), DOWN to (2,2) (its own body, unsafe), LEFT to (1,3), or RIGHT to (3,3). So it might move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. It is not an immediate threat to (2,5) since it can't reach there in one move. However, if I move RIGHT to (2,5), next turn I might be adjacent to the enemy if it moves UP to (2,4). But that is manageable.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should move towards the apples. The apple at (1,8) is directly above me, and (4,6) is to the right and up. Moving UP to (1,6) is a direct step towards (1,8). Moving RIGHT to (2,5) is a step towards (4,6) and (7,4). Both are good.\n\nHowever, moving UP to (1,6) is slightly better because:\n- It is closer to (1,8) (only 2 moves away: UP to (1,7) then UP to (1,8)).\n- It avoids potential conflict with the enemy (which is at y=3, while I am at y=5 moving to y=6).\n- From (1,6), I have many options: UP to (1,7), RIGHT to (2,6), or LEFT to (0,6) (but left might be risky if my body is there later).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,5) is also good, but it brings me to the same x as the enemy (x=2) and might lead to a confrontation soon.\n\n**Next turn note:**\nAfter moving UP to (1,6), my body will be [(0,5), (0,4)] (since I didn't eat an apple this turn) and then grow to 3 segments next turn because I had collected 2 apples? Wait, no: I have already collected 2 apples, and my body length is currently 2 segments (head + 2 body parts) which is correct for 2 apples. This turn I am not eating an apple, so after moving to (1,6), my body will become [(1,5), (0,5), (0,4)] (the head moves to (1,6), and the tail moves normally since no apple eaten). So my body length remains 3.\n\nI should continue moving upwards towards (1,8) or rightwards towards (4,6). Avoid going back to (0,5) or (0,4) as they are now body segments.\n\nUP is the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,8) and maintain good mobility.\n\n**Final decision: UP**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - this is my own body (the segment directly behind my head), so unsafe (would die).\n- LEFT: (0,8) - left edge, empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - empty, safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- Moving UP to (1,9): This goes to the top edge. It doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately. From there, next moves would be limited (can't go UP further, so only LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). But DOWN would be into my body? Actually, after moving UP, my body becomes [(1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)] so DOWN to (1,8) would be safe (it's my body but not directly behind head? Wait: the head is at (1,9), the segment behind is (1,8). So moving DOWN would go to (1,8) which is my body segment? That would kill me. So after moving UP, I cannot go DOWN next turn. So UP might lead to a trap.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,8): This goes to the left edge. It doesn't get me closer to apples. From there, next moves: UP to (0,9) (safe), RIGHT to (1,8) (which is my body? Actually, after moving LEFT, my head is at (0,8), and my body is [(0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. So moving RIGHT to (1,8) would be my body segment and kill me. So LEFT also limits future options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,8): This moves me towards the center and towards apples like (4,6), (7,4), (8,4), (9,7), (9,5). From (2,8), next moves: UP to (2,9), DOWN to (2,7), LEFT to (1,8) (my body? But after moving RIGHT, my head is at (2,8), body is [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]. So LEFT to (1,8) is my body and would kill me. So only UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe next turn? Actually, DOWN to (2,7) is empty, UP to (2,9) is empty, RIGHT to (3,8) is empty. So moving RIGHT gives me more options next turn.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nThe enemy at (4,4) might move. It could go UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (5,4). It might be heading towards the apple at (4,6) or (7,4) or (8,4). It doesn't threaten me directly.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples to me are (4,6) and (9,7). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to these.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should avoid moves that trap me (like going to edges where I have fewer options). Moving RIGHT seems best as it keeps me in the center and opens paths to multiple apples. After moving to (2,8), I can plan to go further right or down towards (4,6) or (7,4).\n\nAvoid moving DOWN in the future as it would go into my body.\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT** is the best move to progress towards apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT gets me closer to these. Specifically, from (4,8), I can plan to go DOWN to (4,7) then DOWN to (4,6) (but enemy might be there) or further RIGHT and DOWN. Alternatively, going DOWN now to (3,7) also gets me closer to (7,4) via a path like (3,7) -> (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (6,7) -> (7,7) then DOWN to (7,6) and DOWN to (7,5) and DOWN to (7,4). But that is longer.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should avoid moves that trap me (like going to edges where I have fewer options). Both DOWN and RIGHT are good. RIGHT gets me closer to apples faster. However, DOWN gives me more options to avoid the enemy and also approach apples from a different angle.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (4,6), moving RIGHT to (4,8) might put me in a position where I can compete for apples, but also risk head-on collisions in the future. Moving DOWN to (3,7) avoids the enemy and keeps me safe.\n\nBut since the enemy is not directly threatening, and RIGHT is safe and efficient for apple collection, I prefer RIGHT.\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT** is the best move to progress towards apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

It doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately. From there, next moves would be limited (can't go UP further, so only LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN). LEFT to (3,9) is empty? Currently (3,9) is empty. But after moving UP, my body becomes [(4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So LEFT to (3,9) is safe? Actually, (3,9) is adjacent and empty. However, moving DOWN to (4,8) would be my body and kill me. So UP limits future options (only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn).\n- Moving DOWN to (4,7): This moves me down. It gets me closer to apples like (7,4) and (8,4). From there, next moves: LEFT to (3,7) is empty? Currently (3,7) is empty. RIGHT to (5,7) is empty. DOWN to (4,6) is currently empty (but enemy might move there). UP to (4,8) is my body and unsafe. So LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN are safe. This gives good flexibility.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,8): This moves me towards the center and towards apples like (7,4), (8,4), (9,7), (9,5). From (5,8), next moves: UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7), RIGHT to (6,8). All are currently empty. LEFT to (4,8) is my body and unsafe. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe. This also gives good flexibility.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nThe enemy at (5,6) might move.

It doesn't threaten me directly at this turn.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples to me are (8,4) and (7,4). Moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to these (distance reduced from 5 to 4 for (7,4) and 5 to 4 for (8,4)). Moving RIGHT to (5,8) also reduces distance (to (7,4) from 5 to 4, to (8,4) from 5 to 4). Both are equally good in terms of distance reduction. However, moving DOWN puts me in a position where I can potentially go to (4,6) next (if enemy moves away) and then further down, while moving RIGHT keeps me on the top half.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should avoid moves that trap me (like going to edges). Both DOWN and RIGHT are good. DOWN gets me closer to the cluster of apples at (7,4) and (8,4) and also (8,1). RIGHT also gets me closer. However, moving DOWN might put me in competition with the enemy at (5,6), but it is safe for now.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (5,6), moving DOWN to (4,7) avoids direct confrontation (since enemy is at (5,6) and I'm at (4,7), not adjacent). Moving RIGHT to (5,8) is also safe.\n\nI prefer DOWN because it progresses directly towards the apple cluster and gives me good options to continue downward or rightward.\n\n**Final decision: DOWN** is the best move to progress towards apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

Also, note that enemy might move to (4,6) or (5,6) is its body? Actually, (4,6) is enemy body (part of snake #1's body). So moving DOWN to (4,6) would hit enemy body and die. Therefore, DOWN is unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,7) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,7) - empty, safe.\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7): This moves me away from the enemy and towards the left side.

This gives three options.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy at (6,5) can move UP to (6,6) (empty), DOWN to (6,4) (empty), LEFT to (5,5) (its body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (7,5) (empty). It might be heading towards apples like (7,4) or (8,4). Moving RIGHT to (6,7) avoids direct adjacency (enemy at (6,5) and I at (6,7) are two apart vertically). However, if enemy moves UP to (6,6), it becomes adjacent to my DOWN option from (6,7), which might be risky next turn.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples are (7,4) and (8,4). From (5,7) to (7,4) is Manhattan distance 5. Moving RIGHT to (6,7) reduces distance to (7,4) to |6-7| + |7-4| = 1+3=4. Moving UP to (5,8) increases distance to (7,4) to |5-7| + |8-4| = 2+4=6. So RIGHT is better for apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should continue moving towards the apple cluster at right/bottom. RIGHT is more progressive and gives more flexibility (three safe next moves vs two for UP). Also, being at (6,7) keeps me closer to multiple apples and away from the enemy.\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT** is the best move to progress towards apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN to (6,6) reduces distance to (7,4) to |6-7| + |6-4| = 1+2=3 but is riskier due to enemy proximity.

This moves away from apples and enemy.\n- DOWN to (8,6): Next moves: UP to (8,7) my body (unsafe), DOWN to (8,5) empty, LEFT to (7,6) empty, RIGHT to (9,6) empty. So three safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This moves closer to enemy at (8,4) and apples at (9,5) and (8,1).\n- RIGHT to (9,7): This eats the apple. After eating, my snake will grow to length 5 (head at (9,7), body extends to include (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)). Next moves from (9,7): UP to (9,8) empty, DOWN to (9,6) empty, LEFT to (8,7) my body (unsafe), RIGHT off board (unsafe). So only UP and DOWN are safe. This is a bit risky because it reduces future options to two directions.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy at (8,4) can move UP to (8,5) empty, DOWN to (8,3) empty, LEFT to (7,4) its body (unsafe), RIGHT to (9,4) empty. It will likely avoid LEFT and choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving UP to (8,5) brings it closer to (9,5) apple. Moving RIGHT to (9,4) is safe but not directly threatening me immediately.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples are (9,7) (adjacent), (9,5) (distance |8-9| + |7-5|=1+2=3), and (8,1) (distance |8-8| + |7-1|=0+6=6). Eating (9,7) is very attractive.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEating the apple at (9,7) is important to catch up in score (enemy has 4, I have 3). However, moving RIGHT to (9,7) leaves me with only two safe moves next turn (UP or DOWN). I should consider if I can safely eat it without getting trapped. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (8,6) might allow me to approach (9,5) or (8,1) with more options, but it brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (8,4) and might move UP towards (9,5), I should avoid moving DOWN too aggressively. Eating (9,7) now is safe and gives me a point. Even though next turn I have only two moves, both are safe and I can reassess. Also, after eating, my body extends, so the tail is at (5,7), which might open up space later.\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT** to eat the apple at (9,7) is the best move to gain a point and stay competitive. It is safe this turn and provides immediate reward. I'll deal with the reduced options next turn.\n\nRIGHT",

So two safe options (UP and LEFT).\n- DOWN to (9,6): Next moves: UP to (9,7) my body (unsafe), DOWN to (9,5) apple (safe to eat), LEFT to (8,6) empty, RIGHT off board (unsafe). So two safe options (DOWN and LEFT).\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy at (8,5) can move UP to (8,6) empty, DOWN to (8,4) its body (unsafe), LEFT to (7,5) empty, RIGHT to (9,5) apple. It will likely avoid DOWN and choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (9,5) eats the apple and grows. Moving UP to (8,6) is safe and might be chosen to avoid risk.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (9,5), it will be adjacent to my head if I move DOWN to (9,6). That could lead to a head-on collision if I move to (9,5) next turn? But we move simultaneously, so if I move DOWN to (9,6) and enemy moves RIGHT to (9,5), we are adjacent but not colliding this turn. Next turn, if I move DOWN to (9,5) and enemy is still at (9,5), we collide. However, if enemy eats the apple at (9,5), it will grow to length 5 (head at (9,5), body extends to include (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5)). So (9,5) becomes its body next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (9,6) might put me near the enemy if it goes to (9,5). But it's safe this turn.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apples are (9,5) (directly below me) and (5,9) (far). Eating (9,5) would be good to gain a point (tying the enemy at 5 apples each).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI need to avoid getting trapped. Currently, I have only two moves. Moving UP to (9,8) is safe and gives me options to go to (9,9) or (8,8). Moving DOWN to (9,6) is safe and allows me to potentially eat (9,5) next turn (if enemy doesn't take it first) or go to (8,6).\n\nHowever, if I move DOWN to (9,6), and enemy moves to (9,5), then next turn I cannot move DOWN to (9,5) because it would be enemy body. I could only go LEFT to (8,6) or UP to (9,7) (my body). So only one safe move (LEFT). That is risky.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,8), and enemy does not come near, I have two moves next turn (UP to (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8)). This is slightly better for future options.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (5,9) is far, but I might need to plan a path eventually.\n\n**Final decision: UP** to (9,8) is safer because it avoids potential confrontation with the enemy at (9,5) and gives me more breathing room. I can then consider moving to (9,9) or (8,8) next turn.\n\nUP\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nAfter moving UP to (9,8), assess enemy position. If enemy is not threatening, consider moving LEFT to (8,8) to open more options or UP to (9,9). Avoid getting cornered. The apple at (5,9) is a long-term target, but prioritize safety and maintaining multiple moves.",

Actually, the board shows its body segments: at (9,5) is head, then (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5) \u2014 that's 6 segments. So it must have eaten an apple (probably at (9,5)) to grow to length 6.

Wait, the board state:\nRow 5: \". . . . . . T . T 1\" \u2014 so (9,5) is snake #1 head? And (8,5) is its body? So it has head at (9,5) and body segments: (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5).

However, for safety, we assume the enemy has grown to length 6.\n\n**Apples:** (8,1), (2,6), (7,0), (5,9), (7,3)\n\n**Possible moves for my snake:**\n- UP: (9,9) \u2014 empty?

Because last turn it was at (9,5) and could move UP or DOWN. It must have moved DOWN to (9,4))\n- Body: [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4)] (length 6 segments? But scores say 5 apples. There might be a discrepancy, but we'll assume it has 6 segments for safety.)\n- Apples: 5 (according to scores)\n\n**Apples:** (8,1), (2,6), (7,0), (5,9), (7,3)\n\n**Possible moves for my snake at (8,8):**\n- UP: (8,9) \u2014 empty (board shows row 9: \". . . . . A . . . .\", so (8,9) is empty). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,7) \u2014 my own body (directly behind head). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,8) \u2014 empty (row 8: \". . . . . . . . 0 T\", so (7,8) is empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,8) \u2014 my own body (the first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Enemy snake (ID 1) at (9,4):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (9,5) \u2014 its own body (directly behind head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (9,3) \u2014 empty? Row 3: \". . . . . . . A . .\" so (9,3) is empty.\n- LEFT: (8,4) \u2014 its own body (directly behind head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: off board (10,4) \u2014 invalid. Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can only move DOWN to (9,3). It has no other options. This is good for us.\n\n**Which move is better for me?**\n- UP to (8,9): Next moves: UP off board (unsafe), DOWN to (8,8) my body (unsafe), LEFT to (7,9) empty, RIGHT to (9,9) empty. So two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n- LEFT to (7,8): Next moves: UP to (7,9) empty, DOWN to (7,7) my body (unsafe), LEFT to (6,8) empty, RIGHT to (8,8) my body (unsafe). So two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nBoth moves give two safe follow-ups. However, consider apples:\n- The apple at (5,9) is above and to the left. Moving UP to (8,9) gets closer to it.\n- The apple at (7,3) is below and to the left. Moving LEFT to (7,8) is neutral.\n- The apple at (7,0) is far below, (8,1) is below, (2,6) is far left.\n\nAlso, the enemy is forced to move DOWN to (9,3), which is away from us and not threatening.\n\nLong-term: We want to collect apples to catch up to enemy (we have 4, they have 5). The closest apple is (5,9) \u2014 moving UP gets us closer. Also, (8,9) is safe and opens paths to (7,9) and (9,9), which are both empty.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7,8) is also safe, but doesn't get us closer to any apple immediately. However, it might be useful to go towards (7,3) or (8,1) later.\n\nBut since UP gives similar options and is closer to (5,9), it is slightly better.\n\nAlso, note that after moving UP to (8,9), we have two moves: LEFT to (7,9) and RIGHT to (9,9). Both are safe and open more options.\n\nTherefore, UP is preferred.\n\n**Final decision: UP** to (8,9).\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nAfter moving UP to (8,9), we can go LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9). Both are safe. Consider moving towards the apple at (5,9) by going LEFT in future turns. Enemy is forced to move DOWN to (9,3) and will be trapped at the bottom right corner (it has only one move each turn now). We should capitalize by collecting apples quickly.\n\nUP",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2014 empty (row 2: all dots). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2014 contains an apple (7,3). Safe (eating apple will grow, so it won't die by moving into apple).\n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2014 its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,3) to eat the apple.\n\n**Which move is better for me?**\n- LEFT to (6,9): This moves closer to the apple at (5,9). Next moves from (6,9): UP off board (unsafe), DOWN to (6,8) empty (row 8: (6,8) is \".\"), LEFT to (5,9) apple (safe and beneficial), RIGHT to (7,9) my body (unsafe). So only DOWN and LEFT are safe. LEFT leads to the apple.\n- DOWN to (7,8): This moves away from the apple at (5,9). Next moves from (7,8): UP to (7,9) my body (unsafe), DOWN to (7,7) empty (row 7: (7,7) is \".\"), LEFT to (6,8) empty, RIGHT to (8,8) my body (unsafe). So DOWN and LEFT are safe. This doesn't progress towards apples.\n\nLEFT is clearly better because it gets us closer to (5,9). Also, the enemy is moving towards (7,3) or (8,2), which is far from us (we are at top, enemy at bottom). We should prioritize collecting (5,9) to catch up in apples (4 vs 5).\n\nLong-term: After eating (5,9), we become length 5 (same as enemy? Actually enemy has 5 apples so length 6 segments). We need to plan for next apples: (7,0) and (8,1) are below, but enemy might be going for (7,3) now. We should avoid head-on collisions and focus on safe paths.\n\n**Final decision: LEFT** to (6,9) to approach (5,9).\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (6,9), we should go LEFT to (5,9) to eat the apple. That is the priority. If for some reason LEFT is blocked next turn (unlikely), DOWN to (6,8) is safe and we can reassess. Enemy is likely to eat (7,3) and grow, so we need to catch up.\n\nLEFT",

However, we are at the top row (y=9) and moving left might lead to a dead end if we go too far left without descending.\n\nDOWN to (5,8) moves us downward, which is beneficial because most apples are at lower rows (y=0,1,6,8). Specifically, apples at (7,0), (8,1), (6,0) are below, and (1,8) and (2,6) are to the left but also lower. Descending now opens up more options.\n\nAlso, note that our body is in the top-right corner. We need to navigate down to avoid being trapped. Moving DOWN to (5,8) is a step in that direction. From (5,8), we can then go LEFT to (4,8) or DOWN to (5,7) next turn, both likely safe.\n\nLEFT to (4,9) is safe but keeps us at the top row, which has limited options. We might have to go down eventually, but delaying it could be risky.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nWe should descend to the lower half where the apples are. The apples at (7,0), (8,1), and (6,0) are close to each other and could be collected in sequence. The enemy is also near that area (at (7,2)), so we need to be cautious. However, the enemy has more apples (6 vs our 5) and is longer, so we should avoid direct confrontation. We can try to collect the apples in the left (like (1,8) and (2,6)) which are farther from the enemy.\n\nBut for now, moving DOWN to (5,8) is a safe step towards descending. It keeps multiple options open: next turn we can go LEFT, DOWN, or possibly RIGHT (if safe) from (5,8).\n\nLEFT to (4,9) is less flexible: from (4,9), we can only go DOWN (since UP is off, LEFT to (3,9) might be safe, but we are still at the top). So DOWN is better for future flexibility.\n\n**Final decision: DOWN** to (5,8) to start descending towards the apples.\n\nDOWN",

It doesn't risk potential head-on collision paths with the enemy\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to (7, 0) to collect that apple, then assess whether to go for (8, 1) or (6, 0) based on enemy movement. The southern cluster gives me the best opportunity to extend my lead (currently 6-5).\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,7) \u2014 empty (from board: row 7 has dots at (5,7)). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,8) \u2014 empty (row 8: (4,8) is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) \u2014 empty (row 8: (6,8) is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake (ID 1) at (7,1):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (7,2) \u2014 its own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,0) \u2014 apple (row 0: (7,0) is \"A\"). Safe (and will eat apple).\n- LEFT: (6,1) \u2014 empty (row 1: (6,1) is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) \u2014 apple (row 1: (8,1) is \"A\"). Safe (and will eat apple).\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN (to eat (7,0)), RIGHT (to eat (8,1)), or LEFT (to (6,1)).\n\nThe enemy is very likely to eat an apple this turn: either (7,0) or (8,1). It will grow to length 7 (head + 7 body segments) after eating.\n\n**Which move is better for me?**\nWe should avoid the enemy since it is longer and might be aggressive. The enemy is at (7,1) and can move to (7,0) or (8,1) to eat. We are at (5,8), which is far enough.\n\nOur goal is to collect apples safely. The apples at (1,8) and (2,6) are to the left and down, while (6,0) is far down. The enemy is focused on the bottom-right apples.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,8) heads towards (1,8) and (2,6). This is a good direction to collect apples without competing with the enemy.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,7) also descends and opens paths to the left or right later. But it doesn't directly approach any apple immediately.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,8) moves slightly towards the enemy area, which is risky. The enemy might move up later? But currently, it is busy with apples below.\n\nHowever, note that after eating, the enemy will be longer and more dangerous. We should avoid the bottom-right area for now.\n\nLEFT is the best: it moves us towards the left-side apples (1,8) and (2,6), which are far from the enemy. From (4,8), we can next go DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,8) to continue towards (1,8).\n\nDOWN is also safe but less directed towards apples.\n\nRIGHT is safe but moves towards the enemy zone.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead left to collect (1,8) and (2,6). Avoid the enemy in the bottom-right. The enemy will likely be busy around (7,0) and (8,1) for a while. We can collect the left apples and then maybe descend to (6,0) later if safe.\n\nSo for this turn, choose LEFT to (4,8).\n\nLEFT",

Dies.\n- LEFT: (6,0) \u2014 apple (row 0, col 6 is \"A\"). Safe (and will eat apple).\n- RIGHT: (8,0) \u2014 empty (row 0, col 8 is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move LEFT (to eat (6,0)) or RIGHT (to (8,0)). It cannot move UP or DOWN without dying.\n\nThe enemy is likely to move LEFT to eat the apple at (6,0), which will make it grow to length 8. Alternatively, it might move RIGHT to (8,0) to avoid starvation? But (6,0) is very tempting.\n\n**Which move is better for me?**\nWe are at (4,8) and have apples at (1,8) and (2,6) to the left/down. The enemy is at (7,0) and will likely move left to (6,0) to eat, so it will be even longer (8 segments). We should continue avoiding the enemy and collecting apples on the left.\n\nOur safe moves:\n- UP to (4,9): moves up, but row 9 has no apples and might lead to a dead-end? From (4,9), we can go left to (3,9) or right to (5,9) (but (5,9) is our body) or down to (4,8) (which is our current head). So only left or down? Not great.\n- DOWN to (4,7): moves down towards (2,6) apple. From (4,7), we can go left to (3,7), down to (4,6), or right to (5,7). Good options.\n- LEFT to (3,8): moves left towards (1,8) apple. From (3,8), we can go left to (2,8), down to (3,7), or up to (3,9). Also good.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good for reaching apples. However, note that the apple at (1,8) is directly to the left (same row), while (2,6) is down and left. Moving LEFT gets us closer to (1,8) immediately.\n\nAlso, the enemy is far away and busy with the bottom apples. We should prioritize collecting the left apples quickly.\n\nLEFT is the best: it moves us directly towards (1,8). From (3,8), we can next go LEFT to (2,8) and then DOWN to (2,7) to approach (2,6), or even continue to (1,8).\n\nDOWN is also good, but LEFT is more direct for the nearest apple (1,8).\n\nUP is less desirable as it moves away from the apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue left to collect (1,8) and then (2,6). After that, consider going down to (6,0) if safe, but avoid the enemy which is growing in the bottom-right. The enemy is at (7,0) and will likely be around that area. We should stay on the left side.\n\nSo for this turn, choose LEFT to (3,8).\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - enemy's own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,0). It will likely move UP toward the apple at (8,1) or LEFT to avoid hitting itself.\n\n**My strategy:**\nWe have two apples nearby: (1,8) to the left and (2,6) down-left. Moving LEFT gets us directly toward (1,8). From (2,8), we can then go DOWN to (2,7) and then to (2,6) apple.\n\nDOWN also gets us closer to (2,6), but LEFT is more direct for the nearest apple (1,8).\n\nUP moves us away from both apples and toward the top edge, which could limit future options.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue left to collect (1,8) and then (2,6). After that, consider moving down to collect (1,7) and then potentially toward the right side apples, but be cautious of the enemy snake which is longer (8 apples) and may move upward.\n\nLEFT is the best move to continue our path toward the apples on the left side.\n\nLEFT",

Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,3) - empty (row 3, col 5 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - its own body. Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,3). It is currently far from us and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have 3 safe moves. We want to collect apples to catch up to enemy (8 vs our 7). The closest apples are (2,6) and (5,0). (2,6) is nearby.\n\n- DOWN to (1,6): moves us closer to (2,6) apple. From (1,6), we can go RIGHT to (2,6) to collect it next turn.\n- LEFT to (0,7): moves away from apples, but safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): also moves closer to (2,6) (we can go DOWN to (2,6) next turn).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get us closer to (2,6). However, DOWN is better because:\n- It avoids moving into the center where enemy might be heading.\n- After DOWN to (1,6), we can go RIGHT to (2,6) to collect the apple. This path is safe and direct.\n- RIGHT to (2,7) is also good, but then we need to go DOWN to (2,6) which might be occupied by enemy? But enemy is at (6,3) and moving UP/LEFT, so (2,6) should be safe.\n\nActually, both are equally good for reaching (2,6). But consider long-term: after collecting (2,6), we can target (5,0) or (8,1). Also, we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nAnother point: our tail is at (6,9). Moving DOWN or RIGHT doesn't risk running into tail soon.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (1,6) to approach (2,6).\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (2,6) to collect apple.\n- Then, consider moving DOWN to (2,5) and LEFT to (1,5), etc., to eventually target (5,0) or (8,1).\n\nDOWN is the best choice to set up for (2,6).\n\nDOWN",

It's the most direct path to the nearest apple (8, 4)\n2. From there I can reach (8, 4) next turn\n3. It keeps me positioned for the northeastern apple cluster\n4. All three safe directions offer good future options\n\nRIGHT",

Also, moving LEFT to (0,5) might lead to a dead end in the left column? But we can still navigate.\n\nHowever, DOWN is better for immediate progress to the closest apple (1,2).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,4), we can consider:\n- Next moves: DOWN to (1,3) (to get closer to (1,2)) or LEFT to (0,4) (to avoid potential enemy) or RIGHT to (2,4) (but that might be risky if enemy moves left). So DOWN is best.\n- Then from (1,3): DOWN to (1,2) to collect apple.\n- Avoid moving right to prevent enemy encounters.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,2) - contains an apple! Safe and beneficial.\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty (row 3, col 0 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - empty (row 3, col 2 is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake at (8,7):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (8,8) - empty (row 8, col 8 is \".\"). Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - empty (row 7, col 7 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - off the board (x=9 is valid? Actually, board is 0-9 so x=9 is valid, row 7 col 9 is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- DOWN to (1,2): directly collects the apple at (1,2). This increases our score to 9 (tying with enemy) and grows our snake by one segment.\n- LEFT to (0,3): moves towards the apple at (0,1) but requires two steps (DOWN then LEFT or LEFT then DOWN).\n- RIGHT to (2,3): moves away from the apples and towards the center/enemy.\n\nDOWN is the best choice because it immediately collects an apple, tying the score with the enemy. After eating, our head will be at (1,2) and we grow by one segment (so our tail remains at (2,8) and we add a new segment at the end). This also avoids moving towards the enemy.\n\nMoving RIGHT is risky because it heads towards the enemy's territory and doesn't help us get apples quickly. LEFT is safe but slower for apple collection.\n\nAfter collecting (1,2), we can plan to go to (0,1) next. From (1,2), we can move LEFT to (0,2) and then DOWN to (0,1) or DOWN to (1,1) and then LEFT to (0,1). We should avoid moving up (to (1,3)) because our body will be there.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Move DOWN to (1,2) to collect the apple and tie the score.\n- Next turn, from (1,2), we can move LEFT to (0,2) or DOWN to (1,1) to approach (0,1). Avoid UP (into body) and RIGHT (towards enemy).\n- After getting (0,1), we can consider other apples like (5,0) or (8,1), but be cautious of enemy.\n\nDOWN is the optimal move.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,8) - empty (row 8, col 7 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,8) - off the board? Actually, board is 0-9 so x=9 is valid. Row 8, col 9 is \".\" (since A is at (8,9) which is row 9? Wait: coordinates are (x,y) with (0,0) bottom left. So (8,9) is x=8, y=9 (top row). Enemy head is at (8,8) (x=8,y=8). So:\n  - UP: (8,9) - apple, safe.\n  - DOWN: (8,7) - body, unsafe.\n  - LEFT: (7,8) - empty (from board: row 8 col 7 is \".\").\n  - RIGHT: (9,8) - off board (x=9 is valid? x max is 9, so (9,8) is on board. Row 8 col 9 is \".\"). So safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP (to eat apple at (8,9)), LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- DOWN to (1,1): moves towards the apple at (0,1) (via (1,1) then (0,1) or (1,0) then (0,0)? Actually, (0,1) is at x=0,y=1. From (1,1), we can go LEFT to (0,1) to eat it.\n- LEFT to (0,2): moves towards the apple at (0,1) (via DOWN to (0,1)) or (0,3) (via UP to (0,3)).\n- RIGHT to (2,2): moves away from the apples and towards the center/enemy.\n\nWe should prioritize collecting apples to get ahead. The closest apples are (0,1) and (0,3). From (1,2):\n- DOWN to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) collects (0,1) in two moves.\n- LEFT to (0,2) then DOWN to (0,1) collects (0,1) in two moves.\n- LEFT to (0,2) then UP to (0,3) collects (0,3) in two moves.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good for apple collection. RIGHT is less beneficial.\n\nAlso consider enemy: it is likely to move UP to (8,9) to eat the apple there, increasing its score to 10. So we need to collect an apple quickly to keep up.\n\nWhich move is safer? Let's check future options:\n- After DOWN to (1,1): from there, we can go LEFT to (0,1) (apple), DOWN to (1,0) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,1) (empty). Avoid UP (to (1,2) which will be body? Actually, after we move, our body shifts: head moves to (1,1), and the tail (2,8) will move? Actually, when we don't eat an apple, the tail moves. So after moving DOWN without eating, our body becomes: head at (1,1), then segments: (1,2), (1,3), ... up to (2,8) but the tail (last segment) is removed? Actually, no: we didn't eat an apple, so the entire snake moves forward: the head moves to (1,1), and each segment moves to the next position. So the body becomes: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)] (tail at (1,8)). So from (1,1), UP to (1,2) is now safe? Because (1,2) is the next segment? But wait: moving backwards into your own body is allowed only if it's not the direct behind? Actually rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" The cell behind the head is (1,2) (since we came from (1,2) to (1,1)). So moving UP from (1,1) to (1,2) is directly backwards and kills us. So from (1,1), safe moves: LEFT to (0,1) (apple), DOWN to (1,0) (empty), RIGHT to (2,1) (empty). So three options.\n\n- After LEFT to (0,2): from there, safe moves: UP to (0,3) (apple), DOWN to (0,1) (apple), RIGHT to (1,2) (which will be body? After moving, our body: head at (0,2), then (1,2), (1,3), ... tail at (1,8). So RIGHT to (1,2) is directly backwards? We came from (1,2) to (0,2), so (1,2) is behind. So moving RIGHT to (1,2) is directly backwards and kills us. So safe from (0,2): UP to (0,3) (apple), DOWN to (0,1) (apple). Only two options.\n\n- After RIGHT to (2,2): from there, safe moves: UP to (2,3) (empty), DOWN to (2,1) (empty), LEFT to (1,2) (body? directly backwards? We came from (1,2) to (2,2), so (1,2) is behind. So LEFT kills. So safe: UP and DOWN. Two options.\n\nSo DOWN to (1,1) gives more future options (3) than LEFT (2) or RIGHT (2). Also, DOWN gets us closer to (0,1) which we can collect next turn.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nFrom (1,1), move LEFT to (0,1) to collect the apple. This will increase our score to 10 (same as enemy if it eats (8,9)). Then we can plan to go to (0,3) or (5,0) or (8,1). Avoid moving backwards.\n\nDOWN",

Actually, it has 10 apples so length should be 11: head + 10 body segments. But the list has 10 segments including head? Wait: the body list for snake #1 is given as [(8,8), (8,7), ... (6,1)] which is 9 segments after head? Actually, the description says \"Body: [(8,8), ... (6,1)]\" and head is (8,9). So total segments: head + 9 body = 10? But it has 10 apples, so it should be length 11. There might be a discrepancy. However, from the board, we see that snake #1 has a long body.\n\n**Apples:** (8,1), (5,0), (0,1), (0,3), (2,7)\n\n**Possible moves from (1,1):**\n- UP: (1,2) - my own body (next segment). Moving backwards? We came from (1,2) to (1,1) last turn? Actually, last move was DOWN from (1,2) to (1,1). So (1,2) is directly behind. Moving UP to (1,2) is directly backwards and kills us. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,0) - empty (from board: row 0 col 1 is \".\"). Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,1) - apple (A). Safe and beneficial.\n- RIGHT: (2,1) - empty (row 1 col 2 is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake at (8,9):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (8,10) - off board (y=10 invalid). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,8) - its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (7,9) - empty (row 9 col 7 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,9) - off board (x=9 valid? x max is 9, so (9,9) is on board. Row 9 col 9 is \".\"). Safe.\n\nSo enemy can move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- LEFT to (0,1): eats the apple immediately. This increases our score to 10 (same as enemy currently). Then we grow by one segment. After eating, our body will extend: head moves to (0,1), and the tail does not move? Actually, when eating, the tail stays put and we add a new head. So our body becomes: head at (0,1), then (1,1), (1,2), ... up to (1,8) (the tail remains). So we have length 11.\n- DOWN to (1,0): empty, no apple. Then we can go to (0,0) or (2,0) next? But (5,0) is an apple far away.\n- RIGHT to (2,1): empty, no apple. Then we can go to (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), etc.\n\nEating the apple at (0,1) is highly beneficial. It brings us to 10 apples, tying with the enemy. Also, it is safe: no risk of collision with enemy? Enemy is far away at (8,9).\n\nAfter eating the apple, we will have more body segments, but we can plan to go to (0,3) next (by UP from (0,1) to (0,2) then (0,3)) or to (5,0) or (8,1).\n\nLEFT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nAlso, consider enemy: it might move LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9). It is not a threat to us immediately.\n\nTherefore, we should move LEFT to (0,1) to eat the apple.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (0,1), our head will be at (0,1) and we have grown. Then we can consider moving UP to (0,2) (which is empty) to approach (0,3), or DOWN to (0,0) (empty) to eventually go to (5,0). Avoid moving RIGHT to (1,1) (which is now body) because that is directly backwards? Actually, we came from (1,1) to (0,1), so (1,1) is behind. So moving RIGHT would kill us. So safe moves from (0,1) would be UP and DOWN.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

We came from (1,1) to (0,1) last turn. So (1,1) is directly behind. Moving RIGHT to (1,1) is backwards and kills us. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n**Enemy snake at (7,9):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (7,10) - off board (y=10 invalid). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,8) - empty (row 8 col 7 is \".\"). Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,9) - empty (row 9 col 6 is \".\"). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,9) - its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n- UP to (0,2): moves us closer to the apple at (0,3). From (0,2), we can go UP to (0,3) to eat it next turn.\n- DOWN to (0,0): moves us down. From (0,0), we can go RIGHT to (1,0) to eventually approach (5,0) or (8,1). However, (5,0) is far.\n\nThe apple at (0,3) is very close (only 2 moves away: UP to (0,2) then UP to (0,3)). This is highly beneficial. Also, the enemy is far away and not a threat to this apple.\n\nTherefore, we should move UP to (0,2) to get closer to (0,3).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving UP to (0,2), we can then move UP to (0,3) to eat the apple. From (0,2), safe moves will be UP to (0,3) and possibly RIGHT to (1,2) (if not body) but we should avoid going backwards. Actually, our body is at (1,1) and (1,2) is body? From the body list: (1,2) is the second segment? Actually, our body is [(1,1), (1,2), ...]. So (1,2) is body. So from (0,2), safe moves would be UP to (0,3) and DOWN to (0,1) (but (0,1) is now body? Wait: after moving to (0,2), our body becomes: head at (0,2), then (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), ... (1,8). So (0,1) is the neck. So moving DOWN to (0,1) would be backwards and kill us. So only UP to (0,3) would be safe? But we need to check: from (0,2), UP to (0,3) is safe (empty), and LEFT is off board, RIGHT to (1,2) is body (since (1,2) is in the body list). So indeed only UP is safe? That would trap us. However, we are going to eat the apple at (0,3) so after eating, we grow and the tail doesn't move. So we can go to (0,3) and then have more options.\n\nBut actually, we should verify: after moving to (0,2), the board state will change. Our body will extend to include (0,1) and (0,2) as head and neck. So (1,2) is still body? Yes. So from (0,2), only UP is safe? That seems risky. However, we are forced to go UP to (0,3) to eat the apple. Then after eating, we grow and our head is at (0,3). Then from (0,3), we can go UP to (0,4) (if empty) or DOWN to (0,2) (which is body) or LEFT off board or RIGHT to (1,3). So we need to ensure (1,3) is safe? Currently, (1,3) is body. But after moving to (0,3) and eating, the tail doesn't move, so (1,3) remains body. So from (0,3), only UP to (0,4) might be safe? But we don't know if (0,4) is empty. This could lead to a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (0,0) gives more options: from (0,0), we can go RIGHT to (1,0) (empty) to eventually go to (5,0) or (8,1). But (0,3) is closer.\n\nGiven that we are tied with the enemy at 10 apples, we need to collect apples quickly. The apple at (0,3) is the closest. We should take the risk to go for it. Also, after eating (0,3), we will have length 12, and from (0,3) we can go UP to (0,4) (which is currently empty) to escape.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nUP",

Eating it would grow us to 12 segments.\n- DOWN: (0,1) - my own body (second segment). Moving backwards? (0,1) is directly behind the head (neck). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (-1,2) - off board (x=-1 invalid). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,2) - my own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo only UP is safe? But wait: we must check if (0,3) is safe. It has an apple, so it's not occupied by any snake body. Therefore, moving UP to (0,3) is safe and we eat the apple.\n\nHowever, we must also consider enemy moves. The enemy snake at (7,8) might move to (7,7), (6,8), or (8,8)? But (8,8) is its body? Actually, from its body list: (8,8) is the third segment? So enemy cannot move RIGHT to (8,8). So enemy can move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8). Both are safe. There is no direct threat to us.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move for us is UP to (0,3) to eat the apple.\n\n**After eating the apple at (0,3):**\n- Our head moves to (0,3) and we grow to 12 segments. The tail does not move.\n- Our new body: head at (0,3), then (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,7) [length 12].\n- From (0,3), we can then move UP to (0,4) (if empty) or RIGHT to (1,3) (which is body? Actually, (1,3) is the sixth segment in our body). So moving RIGHT to (1,3) would be unsafe. Similarly, DOWN to (0,2) is body (neck). LEFT is off board. So only UP to (0,4) might be safe. We need to check (0,4): currently, from the board state, (0,4) is empty (row 4 col 0 is \".\"). So after eating, we can go UP to (0,4) to escape.\n\nThis is acceptable. We are forced to go UP this turn to eat the apple, and then next turn we can go UP again to (0,4).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (0,3), we will be at (0,3) with 11 apples. Then we must go UP to (0,4) to avoid trapping ourselves. From there, we can consider moving rightwards towards (2,7) or (5,0) or (8,1). The enemy is on the top-right, so we should avoid that area for now. We can work our way down the left column to (0,4), (0,5), etc., and then turn right when safe.\n\nSince we are tied at 10 apples, eating (0,3) will put us ahead (11 vs 10). This is crucial.\n\nTherefore, the only safe and beneficial move is UP.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,5) - my own body (second segment). Unsafe (backwards into neck).\n- LEFT: (-1,6) - off board (x=-1). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,6) - empty? Board shows (1,6) is \".\" (row 6 col 1). Safe.\n\nSo we have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 at (3,8):**\nIts possible moves:\n- UP: (3,9) - empty? Board shows (3,9) is \".\" (row 9 col 3). Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,7) - empty? Board shows (3,7) is \".\" (row 7 col 3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,8) - empty? Board shows (2,8) is \".\" (row 8 col 2). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - its own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. None of these moves directly threaten us at (0,6), (0,7), or (1,6). The enemy is far away (top-right) and we are bottom-left.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nWe are currently at (0,6). Moving UP to (0,7) continues our path along the left edge, which is safe and leads to (0,9) and then the apple at (1,9). However, moving RIGHT to (1,6) opens up more options: we can then go UP to (1,7) or RIGHT to (2,6), etc. This might be better for flexibility.\n\nBut note: our body occupies (1,5) and (2,5), so (1,6) is adjacent to our body but not directly connected. It is safe.\n\nHowever, we should consider the apple at (1,9) - we want to get there. From (0,6), going UP twice gets us to (0,8), then we can go RIGHT to (1,8) and then UP to (1,9). Alternatively, from (1,6) we can go UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8), then UP to (1,9). Both paths are similar in length.\n\nBut going RIGHT now might be slightly riskier? Actually, no immediate risk. However, we are longer than the enemy (12 segments vs 11) and leading, so we should play safely. The left column is entirely safe for us until (0,9). Moving RIGHT might bring us closer to our own body and potentially limit future moves.\n\nLet's check future moves from (0,7):\n- From (0,7): UP to (0,8) safe, DOWN to (0,6) body (unsafe), LEFT off, RIGHT to (1,7) safe. So two moves: UP and RIGHT.\nFrom (1,6):\n- UP to (1,7) safe, DOWN to (1,5) body (unsafe), LEFT to (0,6) body (unsafe), RIGHT to (2,6) safe. So only UP and RIGHT.\n\nActually, both positions offer similar flexibility. But (0,7) is closer to the top and the apple at (1,9).\n\nGiven that we are already on the left edge and moving UP is consistent with our previous plan (we moved UP last turn to get here), and it is safe, I think UP is the best choice. It minimizes any risk of accidentally trapping ourselves and continues the clear path.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\n**Note for next turn:** Continue up to (0,7), then (0,8), then (0,9), then RIGHT to (1,9) to eat the apple. This is safe and straightforward.\n\nUP",

Our goal is to get to the apple at (1,9). The direct path is:\n- UP to (0,9) this turn.\n- Then RIGHT to (1,9) next turn to eat the apple.\n\nThis path is safe and efficient. Moving RIGHT to (1,8) would also be safe, but it delays eating the apple by one turn and might lead to more complex situations. Since we are tied (11 vs 11 apples), we should prioritize eating the apple quickly.\n\nFrom (0,8), moving UP continues our upward trajectory along the left edge, which is clear and safe. Moving RIGHT might be useful if we were avoiding something, but currently there's no threat.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy is at (2,7) and might move towards (1,7) or (3,7), but it is not in a position to intercept us to (1,9) immediately.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best choice to continue towards (1,9).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: UP to (0,9)\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (1,9) to eat the apple.\nAfter that, we can consider other apples like (3,2) or (7,1), but we should reassess after eating (1,9).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**My snake (ID 0):**\n- Head at (1,9)\n- Body: [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] (length 12 segments)\n- Apples collected: 12 (just ate the apple at (1,9))\n\n**Enemy snake (ID 1):**\n- Head at (1,8)\n- Body: [(1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8)] (length 11 segments)\n- Apples: 11\n\n**Apples remaining:** (8,1), (5,0), (7,1), (3,2), (3,9)\n\n**Possible moves from my head (1,9):**\n- UP: (1,10) - off board (y=10). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,8) - currently occupied by enemy snake #1's head? But note: enemy head is at (1,8) and will move this turn. So after simultaneous movement, this cell might be empty if enemy moves away. However, if enemy stays, we collide head-on. But enemy cannot stay because:\n  - Enemy snake #1 at (1,8) has possible moves:\n    - UP: (1,9) - currently my head? But I am at (1,9) and will move. So if enemy moves UP to (1,9) and I move DOWN to (1,8), we swap and both die? Actually, simultaneous movement: both heads move to the other's current head? No, that would be a head-on collision? Actually, if enemy moves to (1,9) and I move to (1,8), then enemy ends at (1,9) and I end at (1,8). But (1,9) is now empty? Wait, let's think carefully.\n\nImportant: The board state is before move. After moves are chosen, all heads move simultaneously. So:\n- If I move DOWN to (1,8), and enemy moves UP to (1,9), then:\n  - My new head is at (1,8) - which was enemy's old head position? But enemy is no longer there because it moved to (1,9). So (1,8) becomes empty? Actually, enemy's body segments remain, but head moves.\n  - Enemy's new head is at (1,9) - which was my old head position? But I moved away.\nSo no direct collision? However, if enemy moves UP to (1,9) and I move DOWN to (1,8), we both survive? But wait: enemy's head moves to (1,9) which is now empty (since I left) and my head moves to (1,8) which is now empty (since enemy left). So no collision. However, if enemy moves to (1,9) and I move to (1,8), we are both safe? But then enemy is at (1,9) and I am at (1,8). However, enemy's body is still at (1,7), (2,7), etc. So (1,8) is safe for me? Actually, yes.\n\nBut there is a risk: if enemy does not move UP (to (1,9)) but instead moves elsewhere, and I move DOWN to (1,8), then I might land on enemy's body? But enemy's body includes (1,7) and (2,7), etc., not (1,8) because enemy head was at (1,8) and moves away. So (1,8) becomes empty (unless enemy stays, but enemy cannot stay because staying would be moving to same cell? Actually, enemy cannot choose \"stay\", only one of the four directions.\n\nSo DOWN to (1,8) is potentially safe if enemy moves away. But if enemy moves UP to (1,9), we both survive. However, if enemy moves DOWN to (1,7) (which is its own body) it dies. So enemy will not choose DOWN. Enemy's safe moves from (1,8):\n- UP: (1,9) - currently my head? But I will move. So if enemy moves UP, it goes to (1,9) which becomes empty after I leave? So safe.\n- LEFT: (0,8) - my body? Board shows (0,8) is \"T\" (my body). Unsafe for enemy.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - its own body? Enemy body has (2,8) as the third segment? Actually, enemy body: [(1,7), (2,7), (2,8), ...] so (2,8) is the third segment. So moving RIGHT into its own body is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,7) - its own body (first segment after head). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy only has one safe move: UP to (1,9). Therefore, enemy will definitely move UP to (1,9) this turn.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN to (1,8), it is safe because enemy is moving to (1,9). So (1,8) will be empty.\n\n- LEFT: (0,9) - my own body (second segment). Unsafe (backwards into neck).\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - empty? Board shows (2,9) is \".\" (row 9 col 2). Safe.\n\nSo my safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the outcomes:\n- DOWN to (1,8): safe, and we move towards the lower part of the board where there are apples like (3,2), (5,0), (7,1), (8,1). Also, we avoid the enemy who is moving to (1,9).\n- RIGHT to (2,9): safe, but we are moving right along the top edge. There is an apple at (3,9) nearby. However, enemy is moving to (1,9) so we might be close to it next turn.\n\nWhich is better?\n- DOWN: moves us away from enemy and towards multiple apples.\n- RIGHT: gets us closer to (3,9) apple, but we are near the top and enemy is at (1,9) next turn.\n\nAlso, consider future moves from (1,8):\n- From (1,8): possible moves DOWN to (1,7) (empty?), LEFT to (0,8) (my body), RIGHT to (2,8) (enemy body? Actually, enemy body has (2,8) as a segment, so unsafe), UP to (1,9) (enemy head? But enemy will be at (1,9) next turn). So only safe move from (1,8) would be DOWN to (1,7) (which is empty). So only one safe follow-up.\n\nFrom (2,9):\n- Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8) (enemy body - unsafe), LEFT to (1,9) (enemy head - unsafe), RIGHT to (3,9) (apple, and empty?), UP off board. So only safe move is RIGHT to (3,9) to eat the apple.\n\nSo both moves lead to only one safe follow-up. But DOWN is better because it moves us towards more apples in the long run and away from the enemy.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (1,8) this turn. Next turn, we must move DOWN to (1,7) (only safe option). Then we can continue down towards the apples.\n\nDOWN",
