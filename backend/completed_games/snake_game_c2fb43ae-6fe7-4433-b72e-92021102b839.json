Let's prioritize this one because it's straightforward and avoids any horizontal conflict or complications strategically.\n\nStrategy Reminder for next turns:\n- After getting the apple at (2,6), reconsider if the apples on (4,2), (4,6), (6,6), or (9,3) are still clear and safe targets.

The apple at (9, 3) is right where I'm currently located\n2. Moving RIGHT would collect this apple and grow my snake\n3. UP or DOWN could potentially expose me to risks\n4. LEFT would move away from the apple\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- Collecting apples is key to scoring points\n- Avoid risky moves that could lead to collision\n- Enemy snake #1 is far away and not an immediate threat\n\nReasoning for Move:\n- Given the apple is right at my current location, moving RIGHT makes the most sense\n- This will grow my snake and put me in a potentially good position for the next turn\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- After collecting this apple, look towards the apples at (6, 6) or (4, 6)\n- Be mindful of board edges and snake positioning\n- Avoid unnecessary risks\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Thus at the moment, going back downward onto (2,3) would be unsafe (my own body).\n\nApples available at:\n- (2,6): Closest apple directly above me, just 2 moves away.\n- (4,5): Another quite close apple (right-up direction), would be 3 moves away.\n- (4,6), (6,6), (4,2): Further away apples.\n- Avoiding apple at (9,3), too close to enemy snake #2.\n\nChecking immediate neighboring squares from current head (2,4):\n- UP (2,5): clear path, moves towards apple (2,6). Safe.\n- RIGHT (3,4): clear path too, moves somewhat towards (4,5), but slower to an immediate apple.\n- LEFT (1,4): clear but no apple nearby. Not ideal.\n- DOWN (2,3): occupied by my body. DEADLY\u2014cannot consider this option.\n\nImmediate strategic choice:\n- The apple at (2,6) is very close and clearly reachable. There is no immediate threat or competition.\n- Moving UP towards apple (2,6) continues to be the most logical and direct move.\n\nFuture considerations:\n- After getting (2,6), apple at (4,5) will likely be the best next apple to target due to proximity.\n- Avoid snake #2 for now and keep the safe distance.\n\nIn conclusion, stay consistent with existing safe and optimal plan.\n\nMy decided next move: UP"
