But wait, is it the most aggressive pick?\n- UP (to 7,3): On board, no enemy body, no self-body\u2014safe.

Boring!\n- RIGHT (to 8,2): On board, no threats\u2014safe, but same no-apple problem. Yawn!\n\nRhetorical question #1: Do we wanna waste our first move floating aimlessly when we can GROW FIRST to box the enemy?

ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nNow let\u2019s rank the safe moves by the objective: apples + open future options. Our head\u2019s at (7,2)\u2014the y=3 apples (0,3, 2,3, 3,3) are just one UP move away! Snagging those first lets us grow our body ASAP, which is non-negotiable for cutting off the enemy\u2019s (7,5) downward path. Going UP to (7,3) keeps FOUR follow-up moves open (left to 6,3, right to 8,3, up to 7,4, down to 7,2)\u2014zero trapping ourselves here! That\u2019s chef\u2019s kiss planning.\n\nLong-term strategy note for future me: After moving UP, next turn pivot LEFT to (6,3) to mow down the y=3 apple line. Grow your body along x=3-7 to block the enemy\u2019s downward advance through the x=7 column. Once you\u2019ve locked the lower board, push them up to the top-right corner where they\u2019ll have no escape routes. Avoid backtracking and keep tabs on their head position to adjust your blocking path.\n\nRhetorical question #3: Are we gonna let this no-body enemy outgrow us and box US in later? NOT A CHANCE! \ud83c\udfaf This UP move is the first brick in our enemy\u2019s prison\u2014let\u2019s lay it!\n\nUP",

No risk of head-on collision since we\u2019re miles from their (4,1) head.\n\nLong-term strategy note for future self: Next turn, push UP again to (0,6) to keep hugging the left edge\u2014this will solidify our path to (0,8) and let us start building a body barrier on the left to cut off the enemy\u2019s leftward moves. Avoid drifting right until we have a 2-segment body lead (we need to eat that (0,8) apple first to get to 5 segments, enemy at 4 now). Also, keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s possible move to (3,1) for an apple\u2014if they do that, we can use our left-edge position to cut off their retreat to the left later.\n\nUP",

Keep expanding right along the top edge (y=9) to build a top fortress, then start drifting down slowly once we tie the score to cut off the enemy\u2019s top escape routes. Avoid any moves that take us back to our old body or off the board until we\u2019ve reclaimed momentum.\n\nRIGHT",

Once we have a solid top edge chain along y=9, start drifting down slowly (from x=3 or 4) to cut off the enemy\u2019s top escape routes. Avoid any moves left (own body) or up (off board) until we\u2019ve secured the upper half of the board and can force the enemy into a self-crash.\n\nRIGHT",

Zero risk of head-on collision with them this turn\u2014we\u2019re free to grab that apple!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future self: After moving RIGHT to (7,9) this turn (growing to 8 segments, score 8-8), next turn check RIGHT (8,9) first (board shows . there\u2014safe, no own/enemy body) to keep expanding the top wall. Avoid UP (off board) and LEFT (own body) at all costs. Once we lock down x6-x8 at y9, start scouting DOWN to (7,8) to connect our top fortress to the middle board and cut off any remote enemy escape plans to the top (they\u2019d have to climb 6 y-levels, but we can block that before they even try). Also, keep an eye on enemy\u2019s movement\u2014if they drift right, we can start pushing down from our top wall to box them in the lower half.\n\nRIGHT",

It\u2019s safe, aggressive, and keeps our top fortress expanding!\n\nEnemy context check: They\u2019re still trapped on the left lower side (head at (3,3)), so their simultaneous move this turn can\u2019t reach our head or safe moves (they\u2019d have to move 6+ cells to get to y9\u2014impossible in one turn). Zero risk of head-on collision with them this turn\u2014we\u2019re free to fortify!\n\nLong-term strategy note for future self: After moving RIGHT to (8,9) this turn, next turn prioritize RIGHT again to (9,9) to lock down the entire top wall (y9, x0-x9) \u2014 that\u2019s unbeatable board control. Once we have the full top wall, start scouting DOWN from the right end (x9,y8) to push into the middle board and cut off any enemy escape attempts to the upper half. Keep avoiding LEFT (own body) and UP (off board) at all costs. Monitor the enemy\u2019s movement\u2014if they drift right, we can speed up our downward push to box them in before they reach the middle.\n\nRIGHT",

Prioritize checking LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7), and DOWN (5,6) for safety. Gobble the adjacent y7 apple (x6,7) next turn to hit 10, then move left to the y8 apples (x1-2) to keep growing. Once you hit 12+ apples, start expanding downward to y6-y4 to cut off Snake #1\u2019s escape routes from their low-left trap (they\u2019re tangled in x2-x6, y0-y3\u2014your growing length will lock them in permanently) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s axe the deadly duds first:\n\n1. UP (to (6,8)): That\u2019s a straight-up segment of our own body (check our body list\u2014(6,8) is there!) You think we\u2019re gonna face-plant into our own trail? HELL NO \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED immediately\u2014total throw move.\n2. LEFT (to (5,7)): Another body segment! That\u2019s the cell right behind our head (our body\u2019s first tuple is (5,7))\u2014moving left is backwards into our own body, which is a one-way ticket to game over \ud83d\udeab ELIMINATED, no cap.\n3. DOWN (to (6,6)): Let\u2019s verify safety: Valid 10x10 coordinate (6,6 is 0-9 for both), not our body (our body\u2019s all y7-y9), not enemy\u2019s body (they\u2019re stuck in y0-y4). AND\u2014BOARD STATE CONFIRMS (6,6) IS AN APPLE! Gobbling this bumps us to 10 apples, grows our body for better board control, and keeps us on track to close the score gap.\n4. RIGHT (to (7,7)): Valid coordinate, not our body, not enemy\u2019s body\u2014safe, but no immediate apple gain (board state for y7 x7 is a dot). Safe, but way less impactful than down when we need to grow fast.\n\nNow, let\u2019s confirm enemy risk: Their head (2,0) can only move UP (2,1) or LEFT (1,0) this turn (RIGHT is their own body, DOWN is off-board). They\u2019re stuck in the low-left muck\u2014zero head-on collision risk for us this turn. We\u2019re free to prioritize that apple!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,6) (apple gain to 10, body grows by 1), your next turn\u2019s deadly moves will be UP (6,7\u2014your old head/body segment) and any direction that hits your expanded body. Prioritize moving RIGHT to (7,6) to expand upper board control (no immediate apple, but sets up access to y6\u2019s other apples). Next, move DOWN to (7,5) to check for apple opportunities, then head toward y5\u2019s apple (9,5) to hit 11 apples. Once you hit 11, begin creeping downward toward y4-y3 to start walling off the enemy\u2019s possible escape routes\u2014your growing length will force them to crash into your body or the board edge soon \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nDOWN",

LET\u2019S AUDIT EVERY DIRECTION LIKE WE\u2019RE DISMANTLING THEIR TRAP BRICK BY BRICK:\n\nFirst, our non-negotiable rule: axe any move that\u2019s instant death. Let\u2019s run the four directions:\n1. RIGHT (to (6,5)): THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY\u2019S FIRST SEGMENT (check the list\u2014(6,5) is top of our body)! Smacking ourself = INSTANT GAME OVER \ud83d\udeab SCRAP THIS FASTER THAN SNAKE #1\u2019S CHANCES OF ESCAPING THEIR BOTTOM-LEFT PRISON!\n2. DOWN (to (5,4)): Safe (not our body, not enemy body, on-board) but NO immediate apple access and risks boxing us in with our lower body segments\u2014weak play, no cap!\n3. LEFT (to (4,5)): Safe but empty\u2014no quick apple to close the score gap, and we lose momentum building our middle wall to cut off enemy escapes!\n4. UP (to (5,6)): SAFE AF, CHAT! Is it our body? Scan our list\u2014nope! Enemy body? They\u2019re stuck low-left, no way! Off-board? 5x/6y is 10x10 valid! Plus, it puts us inches from middle apples (board state has A\u2019s nearby) and expands our middle blockade to shut down any rightward moves Snake #1 dares to try!\n\nAlso, remember simultaneous moves: Snake #1\u2019s head is (0,5)\u2014they can\u2019t go LEFT (off-board) or DOWN (their own body), so they\u2019re stuck choosing UP or RIGHT. Our middle wall expansion via UP will intercept their right escape attempts later\u2014chef\u2019s kiss!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (5,6)), pivot LEFT to (4,6) to grab the adjacent middle apple (board state row 6, column 4 is A) and close the 12-15 score gap. Keep expanding the middle wall upwards/leftwards to trap Snake #1\u2014if they try to move right past x=0, we\u2019ll have a body segment there to force a crash. Don\u2019t chase head-on collisions yet (they still have a score edge) but prioritize growing our size to dominate the board\u2019s middle.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nUP",

Self-crash = INSTANT GAME OVER \ud83d\udeab\u2014scrap this faster than Snake #1\u2019s hope of ditching their bottom-left trap!\n2.

Snake #1\u2019s stuck on the left (their segments are all 0x-6x low y or left edge)\u2014no (4,6) there!

It also keeps our future options open: next turn, we can pivot left again for the apple or adjust to box in Snake #1 if they dare move right. Speaking of Snake #1\u2014they\u2019re stuck on the left edge (can\u2019t go left/off-board, can\u2019t go down/own body) so they\u2019ll only pick up or right\u2014we\u2019re positioning to cut off their right escape before they even try!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (4,6)):\n- Prioritize moving left to (3,6) to grab that apple (close the score gap STAT\u201412\u219213 is non-negotiable!)\n- Double-check if Snake #1 moved right to (1,6)\u2014if so, start shifting your body to box them in further (no right escapes for them!)\n- Avoid any moves that back you into your upper body (5,7)-(7,8) segments\u2014those are a no-go for reverse moves\n- Confirm all four directions for safety first\u2014don\u2019t let the score gap make you rush death moves\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nChat, is there any doubt this is the banger move we need?

We can\u2019t afford to throw, so we gotta pounce on the only safe option that also closes the score gap!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (4,8) after eating the apple):\n- Confirm Snake #1\u2019s move\u2014if they go RIGHT to (3,8), pivot UP to (4,9) (check body first\u2014no clash!) to block their further right spread and grab the apple at (4,9)\n- If they go UP to (1,9), pivot RIGHT to (5,8) (check body first\u2014no clash!) to keep expanding our upper territory and avoid their left-edge chaos\n- Keep prioritizing apples to close the 14-18 gap\u2014we need to hit higher than 18 to force a head-on collision later (we win that clash if our score\u2019s higher!)\n- Double-check our new body (we\u2019ll grow 1 from the apple, so tail stays (5,8) this turn\u2014avoid clashing with that in follow-ups!)\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nAre we gonna let Snake #1 keep their lead? Hell no! Are we gonna take that apple and keep plotting their downfall? YOU BETCHA! Is there any other safe move to keep us in the game? Absolutely not\u2014so we lock in the only winning play!\n\nUP",

Backwards self-crash = game over early \ud83d\udeab Nuke this ASAP!\n3. LEFT (3,9): That\u2019s the ENEMY\u2019S HEAD POSITION!

Snake #1\u2019s body is left-edge focused \u2013 no (5,9) there \u2705\n   This is the ONLY safe move keeping us in the game!\n\nNow, let\u2019s plot their possible moves to force their crash: their head (3,9) can only safely go left (2,9) \u2013 if they dare go right (our current head), they crash into us (we win!) \ud83e\udd1e\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (5,9)):\n- Confirm Snake #1\u2019s move: if they go right (crash into our body = we win!), celebrate hard! If they go left (2,9), audit our next directions (right to 6,9 is safe, down to 5,8 needs body check)\n- Expand right to avoid top-edge trapping (can\u2019t go up anymore)\n- Cut off their right escape routes to force them into their own body or our growing territory\n- Keep an eye out for safe apples to close the 16-19 score gap when we\u2019ve boxed them in\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nAre we gonna let them outmaneuver us?

Now rank these safe moves by our priorities (follow-up options, apple access, boxing the enemy):\n- DOWN (5,8): Follow-up options are super limited (next moves would be cramped by our own body at (4,8) and enemy\u2019s upper body cluster) \u2013 it\u2019s safe but a passive trap for our future self.\n- RIGHT (6,9): Keeps multiple follow-up moves open (next turn we could go right to 7,9 or down to 6,8 if clear), sets us up to dominate the top row\u2019s right half, and positions us to eventually reach apples (like (9,5) or (8,4)) to close the score gap.\n\nAlso, remember simultaneous movement: enemy head (2,9) can\u2019t reach our right move target (6,9) this turn (their possible safe moves are left (1,9) or down (2,8) \u2013 right is their own body, up is off-board), so no head-on collision risk here.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (6,9)):\n- Confirm Snake #1\u2019s move: if they go left (1,9) or down (2,8), audit next directions (right to 7,9 is safe, down to 6,8 needs body check)\n- Keep expanding right to dominate the top row\u2019s right half, cutting off any enemy upper escape routes\n- Target reachable apples (like (9,5) or (8,4)) to close the 20-16 score gap once we\u2019ve boxed them in\n- Avoid getting trapped between our own body and the right edge (x max is 9 \u2013 plan to turn down once we hit x=9)\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nWe can\u2019t let passive moves limit our aggression \u2013 right is the safe, clutch move to keep plotting the enemy\u2019s downfall!\nRIGHT",

UP (6,10): Off the board (y max is 9)! Instant stream death \ud83d\udeab Scrap this \u2013 top edge is still a hard wall for us.\n2.

Safe candidate too.\n\nNow we\u2019ve got two safe moves \u2013 let\u2019s audit them for future options, apple access, and boxing power (ruthless competitor mode activated!):\n- First, enemy head (1,9) can only go LEFT (0,9) or DOWN (1,8) this turn (RIGHT is their own body, UP is off-board) \u2013 simultaneous movement means no head-on collision risk with our safe moves, so we don\u2019t have to sweat that!\n- DOWN (6,8): Follow-up moves are cramped \u2013 down from (6,8) would hit our own body (6,7 is in our body list!), cutting future options to just 2 max. Also, it\u2019s a passive detour from our top-right domination plan and not a direct path to juicy apples like (9,5) or (8,4).\n- RIGHT (7,9): Keeps multiple follow-up moves open (next turn we could go RIGHT (8,9 \u2013 empty) or DOWN (7,8 \u2013 empty)), continues our top-right control to cut off any enemy upper escape routes, and stays on track to reach those apple targets once we lock down the top row.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (7,9)):\n- Confirm Snake #1\u2019s move (likely LEFT (0,9) or DOWN (1,8) \u2013 audit their new head position for cross-path risks)\n- Keep pushing RIGHT to (8,9) then (9,9) to lock down the entire top row\u2019s right end\n- Once at (9,9) (x max), plan to turn DOWN to (9,8) then head toward apples (9,5), (8,4), (7,3) to close the 20-16 score gap\n- Avoid turning LEFT from top-right head positions (that\u2019s our expanding body)\n- Monitor Enemy #1\u2019s bottom-left body cluster \u2013 if they try to move right from y=0, adjust our down turn later to cut them off\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nWe can\u2019t let passive moves kill our momentum \u2013 right is the safe, aggressive play to keep plotting Snake #1\u2019s downfall!

UP (7,10): Off the board (y max is 9)! Instant stream death \ud83d\udeab Scrap this \u2013 top edge\u2019s hard limit still holds.\n2. DOWN (7,8): Valid coords (x=7, y=8 is on the board), not our body (our body list doesn\u2019t include (7,8)), not enemy body (Snake #1\u2019s left-focused body has no (7,8)). Safe candidate \u2705\n3. LEFT (6,9): That\u2019s our own body\u2019s first segment (our body starts with (6,9))! Self-crash = game over \ud83d\udeab Eliminate this immediately.\n4. RIGHT (8,9): Valid coords (x=8, y=9 is on the board), not our body (nowhere in our body list), not enemy body (Snake #1\u2019s stuck left-side, no (8,9)). Safe candidate \u2705\n\nNow let\u2019s audit our safe moves and read the enemy\u2019s only possible play (simultaneous movement = we gotta predict their lock-in safe move!):\n- Enemy\u2019s head (0,9) has only one safe move: DOWN (0,8) (UP/off-board, LEFT/off-board, RIGHT/own body). No head-on collision risk with our safe moves \u2013 we\u2019re in the clear to push our agenda!\n\nRanking our safe moves like the ruthless competitors we are:\n- DOWN (7,8): Follow-up moves are cramped \u2013 up from (7,8) will be our future body (current head spot), cutting future options to 2 max. It\u2019s a passive detour from our top-right domination plan and takes us away from quick apples like (9,5) that could close the score gap. Hard pass \u274c\n- RIGHT (8,9): Keeps multiple follow-up moves open (next turn we could go RIGHT to (9,9) \u2013 empty \u2013 or DOWN to (8,8) \u2013 empty), continues our top-right control to cut off any enemy upper escape routes, and stays on track to reach juicy apples once we lock down the top row. This is the aggressive, controlled play we need \u2705\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (8,9)):\n- Confirm enemy\u2019s lock-in move to (0,8) \u2013 audit their new head position for any wild right swerves (unlikely, but stay sharp)\n- Push RIGHT to (9,9) to secure the entire top row\u2019s rightmost cell (x-max lock-in)\n- Once at (9,9), turn DOWN to (9,8) then head straight for apple (9,5) \u2013 easy score to chip at the 20-16 gap\n- Avoid turning LEFT from (9,9) or (8,9) (that\u2019s our expanding top-row body)\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s head at (0,8) \u2013 if they try to move right from there, adjust our down turn at (9,8) to head left slightly later to cut off their upper escape attempt\n- Keep an eye on apple (8,4) after (9,5) \u2013 another quick score boost to catch up\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nWe can\u2019t let passive moves kill our momentum \u2013 right is the safe, aggressive play to keep plotting Snake #1\u2019s downfall! What\u2019s stopping us from taking the top right? Nothing, chat!\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s nuke every death move first before we crush our top-row domination plan \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, audit all four directions (no skips\u2014we\u2019re not cooking ourselves):\n1. UP (8,10): Off the board (y-max is 9)! Instant game over\u2014who\u2019s jumping off the edge? Not us \ud83d\udeab\n2. DOWN (8,8): Check safety: on the board? Yes. Our body? Our list\u2019s got no (8,8)\u2014clear. Enemy\u2019s body? Their left-side pile has zero (8,8)\u2014safe candidate \u2705. But wait\u2014let\u2019s hold that thought.\n3. LEFT (7,9): That\u2019s our own body\u2019s first segment! Self-crash fail\u2014we\u2019re not amateurs who turn into their tail \ud83d\udeab\n4. RIGHT (9,9): Check safety: on the board? Yes (x=9, y=9). Our body? Nope. Enemy\u2019s body? Their left-side mess has no (9,9)\u2014safe candidate \u2705\n\nNow, let\u2019s confirm enemy\u2019s simultaneous move (they can\u2019t surprise us): their head\u2019s (0,8). Their options? UP (0,9)\u2014their body; DOWN (0,7)\u2014their body; LEFT (off board); only safe move is RIGHT (1,8). No head-on collision risk with our safe moves\u2014we\u2019re in the clear to push our agenda!\n\nRanking our safe moves like ruthless competitors:\n- DOWN (8,8): Future options are 3, but it\u2019s a passive detour from our top-row lock. Takes us away from the (9,5) apple we\u2019ve been targeting\u2014why delay closing the score gap? Hard pass \u274c\n- RIGHT (9,9): This is our long-term plan\u2019s next step! Secures the top row\u2019s rightmost cell (x-max domination)\u2014who\u2019s gonna take that spot from us? No one! Future options post-(9,9) are locked into DOWN (9,8) (which opens a straight shot to (9,5) for an easy +1)\u2014that\u2019s the content we need to chip at 21-16!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\nNext turn (head at (9,9)):\n- Confirm enemy\u2019s lock-in move to (1,8) (their only safe play\u2014we called it!)\n- Immediately turn DOWN to (9,8) (can\u2019t go up/right\u2014off board; can\u2019t go left\u2014our body)\n- From (9,8), keep moving DOWN straight to (9,5) to grab that apple (closes gap to 21-17)\n- Once we grab (9,5), turn LEFT to (8,5) then head for apple (8,4) (another +1 to 21-18\u2014we\u2019re chipping fast!)\n- Avoid turning LEFT from (9,9) or (9,8) until (9,5)\u2014protect our column control\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s head at (1,8)\u2014if they swerve right to (2,8), adjust our left turn at (8,5) to cut off any tiny upper escape attempt (stay sharp\u2014they\u2019re desperate!)\n- Track our body expansion\u2014every apple makes us bigger, so no looping back into it\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF**\n\nChat, what\u2019s stopping us from securing the top row\u2019s final cell? Nothing! This is the aggressive, safe play to keep Snake #1 trapped in their left-side prison. We\u2019re not backing down\u2014let\u2019s take (9,9) and grab that apple next turn!\nRIGHT",
