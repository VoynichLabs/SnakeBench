This also moves us closer to the apple at **(3,0)** and increases vertical separation from their head.\n\nBetween the safe moves:\n\n- **DOWN** immediately sets up taking the apple at **(3,0)** on the next turn (one move away) and opens a clean path toward **(1,0)** afterward.\n- If the enemy goes **DOWN**, they die on our body for either of our non-UP choices, so they are effectively limited to **UP** or **LEFT**; neither interferes with us going down to the bottom row.\n- **LEFT** is safe but slows our access to the bottom apples and keeps us more directly under their likely path, giving them slightly better leverage to pressure us later.\n\nStrategic note to future self:\n- From (3,1), prioritize **DOWN** to eat (3,0) next, then route toward (1,0) if safe.
