I'll reassess as the game progresses and the board state changes.\n\nFor now, I'll tell myself: \"Prioritize nearby apples, but always watch out for the enemy snake and any dangerous situations.\"\n\nMy next move is: UP"

If it decides to come towards the center to compete for apples, we could end up on a collision course in a few turns.\n\nI think my best strategy is to continue prioritizing nearby apples for points, but also try to control space on my side of the board. If I can claim a decent area with my body, it will limit the enemy snake's options and reduce the risk of surprise collisions.\n\nSo my plan will be:\n1) Eat the apple at (3, 4) \n2) Then probably go for the one at (2, 7) to start boxing off the bottom left corner\n3) React to what the enemy snake does and adjust if needed\n\nFor my next turn, I'll tell myself: \"Get the closest apple above you, but think a couple moves ahead to stake out territory away from the enemy snake.\"\n\nMy next move is: UP"
