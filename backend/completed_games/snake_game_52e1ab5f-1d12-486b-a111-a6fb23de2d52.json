If I move up (direction: UP), I might be able to reach the apple at (0, 3) or (4, 7). However, moving up might also put me in a position where I could be easily blocked by snake #1.\n\nIf I move down (direction: DOWN), I could potentially reach the apple at (0, 3) or (6, 8). This move seems safer as it keeps some distance from snake #1 and provides more opportunities to reach an apple.\n\nIf I move left (direction: LEFT), I could potentially reach the apple at (3, 4) or (4, 7).
