Current board and positions**  \n- My snake (ID 1): head at (7,8), no body yet.  \n- Enemy snake (ID 0): head at (5,3), no body yet.  \n- Apples at: (3,1), (9,1), (4,4), (6,3), (9,2).  \n\n**2. Possible moves from (7,8)**  \nUP: (7,9) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nDOWN: (7,7) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nLEFT: (6,8) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nRIGHT: (8,8) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \n\nAll moves are safe because I can't hit myself (no body except head) and no snake body near me.  \n\n**3. Enemy consideration for this turn**  \nThe enemy is far away at (5,3), so no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**4. Apple reachability**  \nApple at (6,3) is closest in terms of simple Manhattan distance: |7-6| + |8-3| = 1 + 5 = 6 moves away.  \nBut I should move gradually toward apples while avoiding dead ends long-term.  \n\nFrom (7,8), moving DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8) gets me closer to the center where apples (4,4) and (6,3) are. Moving UP (7,9) goes toward top edge, fewer apples there. Moving RIGHT to (8,8) moves toward right edge \u2014 there are apples at (9,1) and (9,2), but that's far and would require going around.  \n\n**5. Safe follow-up moves**  \nCheck each:  \n- UP (7,9): would have possible next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 but one less option if near wall (UP is blocked by boundary next).  \n- DOWN (7,7): keeps more central; next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely all open.  \n- LEFT (6,8): same \u2014 central, keeps options open.  \n- RIGHT (8,8): near right wall (only x=9 left), so fewer future options.  \n\nThus avoid RIGHT currently to keep flexibility.  \n\n**6. Long-term route planning**  \nThe biggest cluster of apples is at lower right and center-left. One apple at (4,4) is central.  \n\n(6,3) is closer if I go DOWN then LEFT etc. Better to start moving down/left now to eventually snake through apples.\n\n**Choice**: DOWN or LEFT equally good. Let\u2019s pick DOWN because it makes future path to both (6,3) and (4,4) possible, while also moving generally toward multiple apples at lower rows.\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Move toward (6,3) or (4,4), avoid trapping self against walls early.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves from (6,7)**  \nUP: (6,8) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nDOWN: (6,6) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nLEFT: (5,7) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \nRIGHT: (7,7) \u2014 inside board, empty.  \n\nAll moves are safe \u2014 no body yet, no enemy body in adjacent cells.  \n\n**3. Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy head at (6,4), body at (6,3).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP (6,5) \u2014 safe.  \n- DOWN (6,3) \u2014 into own body, deadly \u2192 eliminated.  \n- LEFT (5,4) \u2014 safe.  \n- RIGHT (7,4) \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo enemy likely moves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since enemy has eaten 1 apple, it has length 3 now (head + 1 body segment previously + 1 new segment from apple last turn). So its tail is at (6,3).  \nUsual snake growth: after eating, tail stays in place until next move, then body extends by 1 when head moves. Actually, wait \u2014 in my last move rationale I incorrectly stated enemy body at (5,3), but was wrong: previous turn enemy head at (6,3), ate something? No \u2014 scores: enemy had 1 apple already, so starting length 2 then. On turn 1 they grew to length 2, turn 2 now they are still length 2 because apple consumed last turn grows them next move? Let's clarify:  \nRule says: If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point. So growth happens instantly? Actually, common Snake: when head moves to apple, you grow by 1 starting from next move \u2014 so snake instantly lengthens by 1 cell after eating (the tail stays until next move). Yes: so if enemy ate apple on last move, current turn it moves and grows: current visible body counts eaten apple segment? Wait, let's track:  \nTurn 1: enemy head at (6,4), body=[(6,3)], apples=1. At start, apples=1 means it ate apple before turn 1 display. So actually it has length 2 already including head. No further growth until it eats another apple. Correct \u2014 so enemy length 2 now: head (6,4), body segment (6,3).  \n\n**4. Possible head-on collisions after enemy moves**  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,5), not a threat to me.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5,4), not a threat.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (7,4), not a threat.  \nNo risk of head-on collision this turn since enemy is at least 2 rows away.  \n\n**5. Apple targeting**  \nFrom (6,7), closest apples: (4,4) is 5 Manhattan distance away; (3,1) and (3,0) are farther; (9,1) and (9,2) are far.  \nBest cluster is lower-left apples (3,1),(3,0). Moving DOWN or LEFT gets me closer.  \nAlso (4,4) is reachable via going DOWN then LEFT.  \n\n**6. Future mobility**  \nFrom (6,7), staying central is good. But moving DOWN to (6,6) keeps more flexibility while progressing toward apples.  \nMoving LEFT to (5,7) also fine, but gets closer to left edge sooner \u2014 maybe not ideal yet.  \n\n**7. Decision**  \nMoving DOWN to (6,6) gives next turn options: DOWN to (6,5) toward apples, LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7) (safe since empty currently). This keeps central positioning while making progress toward (4,4) and lower apples.  \n\nLEFT is okay but I\u2019m still far from apples and might as well move toward them sooner.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nHead toward lower-left apple cluster via (4,4). Keep enemy on radar; avoid getting pinned on left edge if enemy advances.  \n\nDOWN",

Body: none.  \nApples: (3, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (3, 0), (2, 4).  \nEnemy Snake 0: head (4, 4), body [(5, 4), (6, 4)], length 3.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Legal moves from (6, 5):**  \nUP: (6, 6) \u2192 empty. Safe.  \nDOWN: (6, 4) \u2192 enemy body segment at T? Wait, check: body of snake 0: tail is last in list: body [(5, 4), (6, 4)] so (6, 4) is tail. But rules say: if my head moves into *any* snake's body (including tail), I die. So (6, 4) is occupied by snake 0's tail *this turn*, but tails move. Need to check movement rules carefully.  \n\nImportant: All snakes move at same time. So on next turn:\n- Snake 0 will move its head from (4, 4) somewhere, causing its tail (6, 4) to move forward if not growing, so unless it eats an apple this turn, tail will vacate (6, 4).  \n\nBut the tail only moves if snake 0 does not eat an apple this turn. So:  \nIf enemy eats apple this turn, tail stays in place (grows), so (6, 4) remains occupied for the next turn.  \nIf enemy does not eat apple, tail moves: the segment at (5, 4) moves to where head is, tail at (6, 4) moves to (5, 4) \u2014 so (6, 4) will be empty next turn.  \n\nThus: moving into enemy's current tail cell is only unsafe if enemy is growing this turn (eating apple now).  \nBut that can't be predicted with certainty. So safer to avoid their current body segments entirely to avoid dependency on whether enemy eats apple now.  \n\nSo DOWN: (6, 4) might be safe if enemy moves away from tail (no apple eaten), but risky if enemy eats apple. Better avoid. That\u2019s too risky.  \n\nLEFT: (5, 5) \u2192 empty. Safe.  \nRIGHT: (7, 5) \u2192 empty. Safe.  \n\nSo initially safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN risky due to possible enemy growth.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (4, 4):**  \nEnemy options: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4) into own body (not allowed).  \nSo enemy will go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.  \nApple at (2,4) is close for enemy. Enemy might go LEFT to (3,4) toward apple (2,4), or maybe UP/DOWN.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), my move LEFT to (5,5) is safe.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nHead-on collision only if we choose same cell.  \nFrom my (6,5) and enemy (4,4), possible same-cell next turn: only if I move to (5,5) and enemy moves UP to (4,5)? No, those are different cells.  \nCollision cell possibilities:  \n- (5,4): enemy can\u2019t go there (body).  \n- (5,5): me via LEFT, enemy via UP? No, enemy UP is (4,5), not (5,5).  \n- (4,5): enemy UP, me from (6,5)? I can't reach (4,5) in one move.  \n- (3,4): enemy LEFT, me? I can't reach in one move.  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting and future safety:**  \nApples: (2,4) near enemy\u2019s path. (3,0), (3,1) bottom-left. (9,1), (9,2) far right.  \nMy safe moves UP (6,6), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5).  \nBest toward apples: LEFT moves toward (3,0)/(3,1) in long path.  \nRIGHT goes away from apples except far ones.  \nUP goes central.  \n\nMap: from (6,5) to (3,0): need 3 steps horizontal + 5 vertical = 8 steps.  \n\nBut enemy blocking leftward path? Not yet.  \n\nBetter to start heading left (LEFT to (5,5)) to eventually get (3,1) area while enemy maybe goes left toward (2,4).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nLEFT to (5,5): available moves next turn: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4) \u2014 wait, (5,4) is currently enemy body but enemy will move. Actually after enemy moves:  \nif enemy ate apple: (5,4) still occupied. If not, (5,4) becomes tail maybe. Still risky to go into recent enemy body squares. So maybe avoid (5,4) next turn.  \n\nUP to (6,6) gives more central space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decide**  \nAvoid DOWN due to tail risk.  \nBetween UP, LEFT, RIGHT:  \nUP most central, keeps options open.  \nLEFT toward apples but not urgent.  \nSince I\u2019m short (length 1), avoiding enemy better initially until I grow.  \n\n**Long-term plan:** Avoid close encounters with enemy until I have length to survive head-on. Move toward left-side apples (3,0),(3,1) gradually.  \n\nUP",

Apple (3, 0) and (3, 1) are farther left/down.  \nLEFT (4,6) continues to move toward left-side apples but still far.  \nRIGHT (6,6) moves toward area around (7,3) apple and central area.  \nConsidering Snake 0 is near left-bottom apples, maybe avoiding left is safer for now.  \nDOWN (5,5) moves toward (7,3) area but also toward enemy, not too close yet.  \nUP (5,7) keeps me away from enemy and leaves options open.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future planning:**  \nSnake 0 will likely move toward apples at (3,1)/(3,0) soon, so left and bottom-left area may get dangerous. Moving UP avoids immediate conflict, gives view of board, and I can loop around top to get apples on right side (9,1), (9,2) later.  \nAvoiding enemy while building length is wise since I\u2019m length 1.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP maintains safety, no conflict risk, and keeps options open for later apple routes without rushing into enemy territory.  \n\n**Next turn plan:** From (5,7), reassess apple positions and enemy location. Possibly move right/top to target (9,2) or (7,3) while keeping distance from enemy.\n\nUP",

It will eat apple (3,0) if it moves RIGHT (4,0) into it \u2014 but (3,0) apple is not actually on the list above? Wait \u2014 check: apples listed: (9,1),(9,2),(7,3),(4,3),(8,0). The (3,0) apple is eaten (now empty)? Indeed, from board diagram: (3,0) is snake 0\u2019s head, no apple.

NO \u2013 actually it moved to (4,1) last turn so (4,0) is 2nd body segment (not directly behind), so DOWN is valid \u2705 because backtracking into 2nd segment is allowed unless body segment behind head is neck? Wait \u2014 rules: \u201cmoving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\u201d \u2014 directly behind head means: if enemy moved UP to (4,1) last turn from (4,0), then directly behind head is (4,0) so DOWN would be illegal. That\u2019s critical.  \n\nLet\u2019s backtrack enemy moves:  \nTurn 12: enemy head was (4,0), body: [(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)] etc.  \nEnemy could move UP to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,0).  \n\nOn Turn 12, enemy moved UP or RIGHT.  \n\nOur observed Turn 13: enemy head is (4,1), body: [(4,0),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)] \u2014 this means enemy moved UP from (4,0) to (4,1).

Actually going DOWN first delays reaching apple.  \n\nFrom (8,3): next move could be DOWN (8,2) then (8,1) then (8,0), or even quickly (8,3) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) apple.  \nFrom (6,3): goes away from the cluster of apples near right edge. So RIGHT seems best.\n\nRIGHT maximizes future options (can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT next turn) and moves toward apples.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nNo traps yet; board is open.\n\n**Plan next turns:**  \nRIGHT this turn to (8,3). Next turn consider DOWN to (8,2) toward (8,0) or RIGHT to (9,3) toward apples at (9,2)/(9,4)/(9,1). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 they might head for (4,3) apple soon so safe to grab right-side apples.\n\n**Final pick:**  \nRIGHT",

So (9, 2) will be my body next turn \u2192 UP not possible.  \nSo from (9, 1): possible only DOWN (9, 0) and LEFT (8, 1).  \nApple at (8, 0) can be reached by going LEFT then DOWN.  \n\nAfter LEFT (8, 2):  \nNext moves from (8, 2): UP (8, 3) is my tail (safe if tail moves away) \u2014 tail now is (8, 3) but next turn tail location will be (9, 3) or (8, 3)? Wait: tail only moves if no apple eaten. Currently apples=2, body length=3 (head + 2 segments). If I move LEFT (8, 2) without apple, tail stays at (8, 3)? Actually no: in snake movement, if no apple eaten, the tail moves forward so the body shifts: old segments: (9, 2) head, (9, 3), (8, 3) tail. New head at (8, 2), body becomes (9, 2), (9, 3), tail (8, 3) removed. So (8, 3) is the removed tail, not in body next turn. Wait, check: body order: head (9, 2) moves to (8, 2). Then body segments become: (9, 2), (9, 3). Tail (8, 3) is removed. So (9, 3) is the new tail.  \n\nSo from (8, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 3): empty (tail gone). \u2705  \n- DOWN (8, 1): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 2): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): my body next turn? Yes, (9, 2) is body then \u274c illegal.  \n\nSo LEFT now gives 3 options next turn.  \n\nDOWN now: after eating apple \u2192 body length increases by 1, so tail does not move: body becomes: head=(9, 1), then old head (9, 2) body, then (9, 3), then (8, 3). So from (9, 1) next turn:  \n- UP (9, 2): body \u274c illegal  \n- DOWN (9, 0): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (8, 1): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: off board \u274c  \n\nSo 2 options next turn after DOWN.  \n\nLEFT now gives more future mobility (3 options) but no immediate apple; DOWN gives apple but slightly constrained next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is at (7, 1). If they go RIGHT (8, 1), they could block me if I go DOWN then LEFT to (8, 1) next turn. But they may not choose RIGHT.  \n\nLong-term: going LEFT now keeps board options open, but enemy might claim column 9 apples. My strategy: eating (9, 1) now keeps lead on apple path (9, 0) next. But (9, 0) is safe? Yes.  \n\nGiven enemy has 5 apples, I need to catch up. Short-term apple grab is good but must avoid traps. After eating (9, 1), only (9, 0) and (8, 1) possible next. (8, 1) possible enemy head if they go RIGHT (8, 1) \u2014 check: head-on collision? We\u2019d both be in (8, 1) if I choose LEFT next turn and they choose RIGHT this turn \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nLEFT move now to (8, 2) avoids that risk because next turn I won\u2019t be forced into (8, 1). I can choose other moves. So LEFT safer for survival.  \n\n**Final choice:** Apple is tempting, but avoiding uncertain next-turn collision risk is more crucial for longevity. Go LEFT.  \n\nLEFT",

(8, 3) is not in my body \u2014 actually wait: my tail is (9, 3)? Body segments: [(9,2),(9,3)]. So (8,3) is fine. \u2705 empty.  \n- **DOWN** (8, 1): Empty? Board shows snake #0 head at (8,1)  \u274c enemy head \u2014 collision risk, but enemy might leave there. Need to check enemy possible moves. Actually, if I go to (8,1) and enemy #0 stays or goes there, we collide. So **unsafe** as simultaneous move? Not strictly illegal if enemy head moves away \u2014 but since simultaneous moves, if snake #0 chooses to stay in (8,1), we collide. Highly risky \u2014 let\u2019s defer final safety after enemy analysis.  \n- **LEFT** (7, 2): Empty  \u2753Board shows empty. \u2705 appears safe.  \n- **RIGHT** (9, 2): My body segment \u274c illegal.\n\nSo immediately illegal: RIGHT (own body).  \nRisky immediately due to possible enemy head collision: DOWN (8,1).  \nSo safe from self-kill: UP, LEFT, and perhaps DOWN if enemy guaranteed to leave.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (8,1):**  \nEnemy body: [(7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(4,0)]  \n\nEnemy legal moves from (8,1):\n- UP (8,2): My head currently \u2014 no, but after we move, my head won\u2019t be there if I move, so for them: (8,2) is empty in next board? Wait, from enemy\u2019s perspective: board now shows (8,2) is my head, so moving UP into my head means head-on collision (both die). So if they value survival, they won\u2019t choose UP unless they want to kill me but also die. They have 5 apples, I have 2; they might avoid suicidal moves. But possible. Dangerous for me if I stay in (8,2)? I\u2019m not staying \u2014 I must move. So irrelevant for them \u2014 they don\u2019t know my move. They see (8,2) occupied by my head, so UP for them is illegal (into my head). So UP (8,2) illegal for them. Check rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" But my head is a snake's body segment? Actually head is part of snake, yes \u2014 so moving into my head kills them too (and kills me if head-on). So yes, (8,2) fatal for them \u2192 they won\u2019t choose UP.  \n\n- DOWN (8,0): Empty \u2705 legal for them.  \n- LEFT (7,1): Their body  \u274c illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9,1): Contains apple \u2014 empty of snakes \u2705 legal.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible moves: DOWN (8,0) or RIGHT (9,1).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I move **DOWN** to (8,1) and enemy moves **RIGHT** to (9,1): no collision (safe).  \nIf I move **DOWN** to (8,1) and enemy moves **DOWN** to (8,0): no collision (safe). So DOWN is actually safe since enemy won\u2019t be in (8,1) next turn! Yes \u2014 because they can\u2019t stay there (no LEFT/UP allowed), so they must leave. So DOWN is safe (no enemy will be there). \u2705  \n\nSo all 3 directions UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (9,1), (4,3), (8,0), (9,4), (6,0)  \n- **UP** (8,3): no apple.  \n- **DOWN** (8,1): no apple.  \n- **LEFT** (7,2): no apple.  \n\nNo immediate apple gain this turn from any move.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Mobility after each move:**  \n\nAfter **UP** (8,3):  \nNext turn body: head=(8,3), body segments: (8,2), (9,2), tail=(9,3) removed? Wait: length 3 currently, so if no apple eaten, tail (9,3) removed. So body next turn: [(8,3),(8,2),(9,2)].  \nPossible moves from (8,3):  \n- UP (8,4): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (8,2): body \u274c  \n- LEFT (7,3): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9,3): empty \u2705 (tail gone)  \nSo 3 options.  \n\nAfter **DOWN** (8,1):  \nBody next turn: [(8,1),(8,2),(9,2)], tail (9,3) removed.  \nMoves from (8,1):  \n- UP (8,2): body \u274c  \n- DOWN (8,0): apple \u2014 but enemy possible target: snake #0 could be there if they chose DOWN. If they are there, I die. Risky.  \n- LEFT (7,1): body of snake #0  \u274c (snake #0 body includes (7,1)) illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9,1): apple \u2014 safe unless enemy there (they might go RIGHT to (9,1)). Potential head-on? Yes, if both go to same apple. But if enemy goes RIGHT, they will be at (9,1) when I go RIGHT \u2192 head-on collision at (9,1). So dangerous.  \n\nActually check: enemy possible moves: (9,1) and (8,0). If I go DOWN to (8,1) now, next turn my only safe moves are to cells possibly occupied by enemy head:  \nFrom (8,1): UP body, DOWN=(8,0) enemy possible, LEFT=(7,1) enemy body illegal, RIGHT=(9,1) enemy possible. So both possible moves have risk of head-on next turn! Very bad mobility. So DOWN now leads to possible death next turn.  \n\nAfter **LEFT** (7,2):  \nBody next turn: [(7,2),(8,2),(9,2)], tail (9,3) removed.  \nMoves from (7,2):  \n- UP (7,3): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (7,1): snake #0 body  \u274c illegal (enemy body at (7,1))  \n- LEFT (6,2): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (8,2): own body  \u274c  \nSo 2 options (UP, LEFT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy apple threat:**  \nSnake #0 might eat (9,1) if they go RIGHT. Or (8,0) if they go DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term survival:**  \nBest safe move with future mobility:  \n- UP \u2192 3 options, safe, no enemy nearby blocking.  \n- LEFT \u2192 only 2 options but safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 almost certain death next turn (too risky).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP maximizes future options. LEFT is okay but more limiting. UP also positions me to get apples in upper rows later (like (9,4),(4,3) eventually).  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP**.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,3), options UP/LEFT/RIGHT open. Watch snake #0\u2019s position after they move \u2014 they may take (9,1) or (8,0). Consider moving toward (9,4) apple safely.\n\nUP",

Long-term strategy\n\nSnake #0 is longer (10 apples vs our 5). Avoid head-on collisions later.  \nWe need to grow quickly to compete. (6, 5) apple is reachable in 2 turns via UP now.  \n\nAlso, (6, 7) and (7, 7) apples are above \u2014 so moving up is good direction.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (6, 5), consider path to (6, 7) or (7, 7) while avoiding possible snake #0 movement toward (5, 9) apple.

Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (4, 5) after eating:  \n- DOWN (4, 4) is empty? Wait \u2014 check board: (4, 4) is snake #0\u2019s body segment \u274c unsafe.  \nSo after eating apple at (4, 5), DOWN will be blocked next turn by enemy body. That\u2019s fine \u2014 still UP, LEFT safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT eats apple immediately, increases score, and keeps good options open.\n\nLEFT",

Actually yes \u2014 next turn, assuming snake #0 moves to (5, 8) or (6, 9), that doesn\u2019t change the safety of my (5, 8) or (6, 7) options except for head-on risk, which we\u2019d have to check on next turn but is not unavoidable. Mobility is good.\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n- UP (6, 7): apple \u2705 safe  \n- DOWN (6, 5): body \u26d4  \n- LEFT (5, 6): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7, 6): empty \u2705  \n\n3 safe moves. Also good mobility.\n\nBoth fine.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Avoid enemy confrontation long term\n\nSnake #0 may go DOWN to (5, 8) next turn, possibly competing for (5, 9) apple. If I go UP to (5, 7), I risk being near the enemy\u2019s path if it goes DOWN and then toward that apple. But with my current smaller size, I should avoid being in a position where I can be easily cut off or forced into a head-on collision.\n\nHowever, UP is actually safe and the apples just above are tempting.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision**: The more direct route to the nearest apples is UP. RIGHT feels like a detour and moves away from the apple cluster. Snake #0 is in the top row and may go down, possibly away from that apple for now.\n\n---\n\n**Plan next turn** from (5, 7): consider going RIGHT to (6, 7) to eat the apple if still available, or UP to (5, 8) if safe. Keep assessing snake #0\u2019s likely moves to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Apple targeting\n\nClosest apples: (6, 7) and (7, 7).  \nRIGHT (6, 7) eats apple immediately. That\u2019s huge \u2014 instant growth and point.  \nUP (5, 8) moves toward (9, 7) or (8, 5) eventually but not immediate.  \nLEFT (4, 7) moves away from apples.\n\nRIGHT is clearly best for apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Good mobility.\n\n**UP to (5, 8)**:  \nMoves from (5, 8):  \n- UP (5, 9): enemy body \u26d4  \n- DOWN (5, 7): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (4, 8): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (6, 8): empty \u2705  \n\n3 safe moves, but enemy might move to (6, 8) next turn, creating possible head-on risk later.\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7)**:  \nMoves from (4, 7):  \n- UP (4, 8): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (4, 6): body \u26d4  \n- LEFT (3, 7): enemy body \u26d4  \n- RIGHT (5, 7): empty \u2705  \n\nOnly 2 safe moves \u2014 worse mobility.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Avoid enemy confrontation\n\nSnake #0 is longer and could threaten cutting me off. RIGHT gets apple immediately and keeps me in open space near other apples (7, 7) next. Enemy is far enough at (6, 9) that RIGHT is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn**:  \nFrom (6, 7) after eating apple, consider going to (7, 7) if safe, or (6, 8) if enemy not there. Avoid moving toward enemy head without escape route.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Head-on collision risk\n\nMy DOWN (7, 6) vs enemy DOWN (7, 7): different cells \u2192 safe.  \nMy RIGHT (8, 7) vs enemy RIGHT (8, 8): different cells \u2192 safe.  \nMy RIGHT (8, 7) vs enemy DOWN (7, 7): different cells \u2192 safe.  \nNo immediate head-on collision possible.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple targeting\n\n- RIGHT (8, 7) \u2192 no apple, but closer to (9, 7) and (8, 5).  \n- DOWN (7, 6) \u2192 no apple, moves away from apples initially.\n\nRIGHT is better for apple proximity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Mobility after each safe move\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 7)**:  \nMoves from (8, 7):  \n- UP (8, 8): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (8, 6): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 7): body \u26d4  \n- RIGHT (9, 7): apple \u2705  \n\n3 safe moves, one leads to apple. Good mobility.\n\n**DOWN to (7, 6)**:  \nMoves from (7, 6):  \n- UP (7, 7): body \u26d4  \n- DOWN (7, 5): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6, 6): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (8, 6): empty \u2705  \n\n3 safe moves, but apples are farther away.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Avoid enemy confrontation\n\nEnemy could go DOWN to (7, 7) \u2014 I\u2019ll be gone either way. Enemy could go RIGHT to (8, 8) \u2014 adjacent to my RIGHT destination (8, 7), but not same cell. Next turn, enemy could move DOWN to (8, 7) if I\u2019m still there \u2014 so I\u2019d need to move away from (8, 7) after arriving.\n\nStill, RIGHT seems better for scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan**:  \nFrom (8, 7), consider UP (8, 8) or RIGHT (9, 7) to eat apple next turn, or DOWN (8, 6) to approach (8, 5). Avoid staying adjacent to enemy head if possible.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s verify:  \n\nActually: current length = 10 apples + 1 head segment? Let\u2019s count:  \nBody length before move = 10 segments + head = total 11 segments. After eating, total 12 segments.  \nTail stays put, new head extends body. So indeed (6, 4) is still tail next turn. Yes, tail moves only if no apple eaten.\n\nSo body after DOWN and eating:  \nHead: (8, 5)  \nBody segments: (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4).\n\nFrom (8, 5):\n\n- UP (8, 6): body   \n- DOWN (8, 4): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 5): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9, 5): empty \u2705  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn after eating apple at (8, 5). That\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy proximity risk:\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (9, 7) (eats apple there), next turn enemy head is at (9, 7), my head at (8, 5) \u2014 not adjacent.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (9, 9), also fine.  \nSo minimal risk.\n\n---\n\nEating the apple at (8, 5) gains a point and doesn\u2019t trap me. It\u2019s better than LEFT/RIGHT which don\u2019t get apple.\n\nLEFT (7, 6): leads to center but far from apples.  \nRIGHT (9, 6): corner area \u2014 possible dead end later.\n\nDOWN is best: immediate apple, safe, keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After eating (8, 5), avoid trapping self in top-right if enemy approaches; plan path toward (2, 5) or (2, 3) apples afterward, keeping distance from enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Immediate safe moves from (8, 5):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 6): Own body segment \u26d4  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 4): Empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 5): Empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 5): Empty \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (9, 7):\n\nEnemy body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6)]  \n\n- UP \u2192 (9, 8): Own body \u26d4  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 6): Empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 7): Own body \u26d4  \n- RIGHT \u2192 Off board \u26d4  \n\nSo enemy can only go DOWN to (9, 6) this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Head-on collision possibility:\n\nEnemy definitely goes to (9, 6).  \n- If I go RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5): Not same cell as enemy, not adjacent horizontally? Wait, enemy at (9, 6) vs me at (9, 5) \u2192 adjacent vertically? No, horizontally adjacent? Actually: (9, 6) enemy and (9, 5) me share x=9, y diff 1 \u2192 adjacent vertically? Yes, they are adjacent vertically (up/down neighbors). That\u2019s not a head-on collision because head-on requires same cell. So no immediate death from RIGHT.  \n\nBut next turn, if we are adjacent, possible head-on risk if we move into each other\u2019s heads \u2014 but that\u2019s future.  \n\nRIGHT is safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple targeting:\n\nNo apple at (8, 4), (7, 5), or (9, 5).  \nClosest apples: (4, 2), (2, 5), (2, 3), etc.  \nLEFT (7, 5) moves toward center, closer to apples eventually.  \nRIGHT (9, 5) moves toward enemy and corner \u2014 less future flexibility.  \nDOWN (8, 4) moves away from enemy but also away from most apples except (4, 2) eventually.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Future mobility after each move:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 4):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP blocked by body (8, 5) will be body segment after move? Wait: after moving DOWN: new body = [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), ..., (6, 4)] \u2014 tail stays because no apple eaten.  \nFrom (8, 4): UP=(8, 5) body \u26d4, DOWN=(8, 3) empty, LEFT=(7, 4) empty, RIGHT=(9, 4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (7, 5):**  \nFrom (7, 5): UP=(7, 6) empty, DOWN=(7, 4) empty, LEFT=(6, 5) body? Check body: (6, 5) is in body \u26d4, RIGHT=(8, 5) body \u26d4. Actually body: (6, 5) is tail end? Wait: body list: (8, 6), (8, 7), ..., (6, 5), (6, 4). Yes (6, 5) is in body. So LEFT from (7, 5) goes to (6, 5) body \u26d4. So LEFT not safe next turn? No \u2014 I must check next turn\u2019s body after moving LEFT:  \nNew head (7, 5), body = [(8, 5), (8, 6), ..., (6, 5), (6, 4)] \u2014 so (6, 5) still in body next turn. So from (7, 5):  \n- UP (7, 6) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (7, 4) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6, 5) body \u26d4  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) body \u26d4  \n\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn after LEFT \u2014 less flexible.\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 5):**  \nFrom (9, 5): UP=(9, 6) enemy will be there this turn? Wait, enemy moves to (9, 6) this turn, so next turn enemy head is at (9, 6). So UP next turn would be enemy head \u2014 not allowed (into enemy body) \u26d4.  \nDOWN=(9, 4) empty \u2705  \nLEFT=(8, 5) body \u26d4  \nRIGHT=off board \u26d4  \n\nSo only 1 safe move next turn after RIGHT \u2014 very risky.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Conclusion:\n\nDOWN (8, 4) gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves away from enemy.  \nLEFT (7, 5) gives 2 safe moves but moves toward apples.  \nRIGHT (9, 5) is dangerous (only 1 safe move next to enemy).\n\nBest is DOWN for safety and keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After DOWN to (8, 4), plan route toward apples (4, 2) or (2, 3) while avoiding enemy. Enemy is long and may block paths; use central area for mobility.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (9, 6):\n\nEnemy body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7)]  \n\n- UP \u2192 (9, 7): own body \u26d4  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 5): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 6): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u26d4  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 6).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Head-on collision risk this turn:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 4), enemy possible moves are (9, 5) or (8, 6) \u2014 no overlap.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3), enemy moves not overlapping.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 4), enemy moves not overlapping.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 3):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(8, 4) body \u26d4, DOWN=(8, 2) empty \u2705, LEFT=(7, 3) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(9, 3) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (7, 4):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(7, 5) empty \u2705, DOWN=(7, 3) empty \u2705, LEFT=(6, 4) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(8, 4) body \u26d4 \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9, 4):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(9, 5) possibly enemy? Enemy could be at (9, 5) or (8, 6) next turn. If enemy goes DOWN to (9, 5), then UP from (9, 4) is enemy head \u2014 deadly \u26d4. If enemy goes LEFT to (8, 6), then UP=(9, 5) empty \u2705. But we can\u2019t guarantee enemy choice \u2014 so UP is risky.  \nDOWN=(9, 3) empty \u2705, LEFT=(8, 4) body \u26d4, RIGHT=off board \u26d4 \u2192 only 1 or 2 safe moves depending on enemy choice \u2192 risky.  \n\nSo RIGHT is dangerous due to possible enemy adjacency.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple targeting:\n\nClosest apple: (4, 2) \u2014 4 steps away.  \nLEFT (7, 4) moves toward center and closer to (4, 2) path.  \nDOWN (8, 3) also moves toward (4, 2) but slightly less direct.  \n\nLEFT seems better for apple route.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy movement prediction:\n\nEnemy likely wants apples too \u2014 apples at (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 0) are near enemy\u2019s tail region. Enemy may move LEFT to (8, 6) to go toward center and down toward apples. That means enemy path may cross mine if I go deep left immediately \u2014 but not immediately dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLEFT (7, 4) gives good mobility (3 safe moves next turn) and moves toward apples while avoiding enemy proximity risk from RIGHT.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7, 4), aim for (4, 2) apple via (7, 4) \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 2), watching enemy movement.  \n\nLEFT",

Head-on collision risk this turn:\n\nEnemy will be at (9, 3) next turn. My possible moves:  \n- DOWN (7, 2) \u2014 safe  \n- LEFT (6, 3) \u2014 safe  \n- RIGHT (8, 3) \u2014 safe  \n\nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s (9, 3). No head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move:\n\n**DOWN to (7, 2):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(7, 3) body \u26d4, DOWN=(7, 1) empty \u2705, LEFT=(6, 2) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(8, 2) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 3):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(6, 4) body \u26d4, DOWN=(6, 2) empty \u2705, LEFT=(5, 3) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(7, 3) body \u26d4 \u2192 2 safe moves. Decent.\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 3):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(8, 4) body \u26d4, DOWN=(8, 2) empty \u2705, LEFT=(7, 3) body \u26d4, RIGHT=(9, 3) enemy will be there \u26d4 \u2192 1 safe move (DOWN). Risky.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple targeting:\n\nClosest apple: (4, 2) \u2014 4 steps away.  \nFrom (7, 3):  \n- DOWN (7, 2) then LEFT (6, 2) etc. leads toward (4, 2).  \n- LEFT (6, 3) then DOWN (6, 2) also works.  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good for apple path, but DOWN gives better next-turn mobility.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy movement prediction:\n\nEnemy forced to (9, 3) this turn. Next turn enemy from (9, 3):  \nPossible moves: UP=(9, 4) body \u26d4, DOWN=(9, 2) empty \u2705, LEFT=(8, 3) empty \u2705, RIGHT=off board \u26d4.  \nSo enemy will likely go LEFT to (8, 3) or DOWN to (9, 2). If enemy goes LEFT to (8, 3), that\u2019s where my RIGHT move would be risky next turn \u2014 so avoid RIGHT now.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN (7, 2) gives best mobility next turn (3 safe moves) and moves toward apple (4, 2).  \nLEFT is safe but slightly less mobility. RIGHT is safe now but risky next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7, 2), go LEFT to (6, 2), then continue toward (4, 2) apple, avoiding enemy path from right.\n\nDOWN",

Future mobility after each move:\n\n**DOWN to (7, 1):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(7, 2) empty \u2705, DOWN=(7, 0) empty \u2705, LEFT=(6, 1) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(8, 1) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 safe moves. Excellent.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 2):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(6, 3) empty \u2705, DOWN=(6, 1) empty \u2705, LEFT=(5, 2) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(7, 2) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 safe moves. Excellent.\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 2):**  \nNext turn safe moves: UP=(8, 3) \u2014 enemy could be there if enemy goes LEFT this turn \u2192 risky!  \nCheck: enemy might go LEFT to (8, 3) this turn, so next turn (8, 3) would be enemy body.  \nActually, enemy body next turn: enemy head moves to (8, 3) or (9, 2). If enemy goes LEFT to (8, 3), then next turn (8, 3) is enemy head\u2019s current position, but enemy\u2019s body next turn will include (9, 3) behind it, so (8, 3) is safe? Wait \u2014 careful:  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8, 3), then next turn enemy body = [(9, 3), (9, 4), ...]. So (8, 3) is enemy head, not body. Head-on collision possible if I go UP into (8, 3) next turn only if enemy stays there \u2014 but enemy will move next turn simultaneously with me, so head-on collision happens if we choose same cell. That\u2019s unpredictable. But (8, 3) could be dangerous next turn if enemy stays still (unlikely). Actually enemy can\u2019t stay still; they must move. So UP=(8, 3) next turn is risky only if enemy moves there again next turn \u2014 low probability. Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (8, 2), next turn:  \nUP=(8, 3) \u2014 possible enemy head if enemy goes LEFT then LEFT again? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nEnemy at (9, 3) \u2192 goes LEFT to (8, 3) this turn. Next turn enemy from (8, 3): possible moves: UP=(8, 4) my body \u26d4, DOWN=(8, 2) my possible position \u26d4 head-on collision if I go RIGHT now and then DOWN next turn? Wait, that\u2019s too deep. Let\u2019s keep it simple: RIGHT seems closer to enemy\u2019s possible path, so higher risk. LEFT and DOWN are away from enemy.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple targeting:\n\nClosest apple: (4, 2) \u2014 3 steps away Manhattan.  \nFrom (7, 2):  \n- LEFT (6, 2) then LEFT (5, 2) then LEFT (4, 2) \u2014 direct path.  \n- DOWN (7, 1) then LEFT (6, 1) then LEFT (5, 1) then UP (5, 2) then LEFT (4, 2) \u2014 longer.  \nSo LEFT is best for apple (4, 2).\n\nAlso apple (2, 3) and (2, 5) are reachable after.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy movement prediction:\n\nEnemy likely to avoid walls: from (9, 3), LEFT to (8, 3) is only non-down option? Actually DOWN to (9, 2) also safe.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8, 3), then next turn enemy is near my RIGHT side. If I go RIGHT to (8, 2), enemy at (8, 3) is adjacent \u2014 risky next turn. So avoid RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLEFT and DOWN both give 4 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT is directly toward apple (4, 2).  \nRIGHT is riskier due to enemy proximity.\n\nBest choice: LEFT toward apple and away from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6, 2), proceed to (5, 2), then (4, 2) to get apple, then maybe down toward (2, 1) or (2, 0) apples while keeping distance from enemy moving on top side.\n\nLEFT",

Which apple to take first?\n\nAll three apples are equally close (distance 1).  \nFrom (2, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3) apple  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1) apple  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2) apple  \n\nConsider board edges:  \n- UP: moves toward top row, still plenty of space.  \n- DOWN: moves toward bottom row, still space.  \n- LEFT: moves toward left edge (x=0), slightly more limiting but not yet dangerous.\n\nBut LEFT to (1, 2) leaves apple (2, 3) and (2, 1) still nearby for next turns.  \nIf I go UP or DOWN, I still have other apples nearby.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nSnake #0 has 13 apples vs my 12. After eating one apple I\u2019ll tie at 13. Need to grab apples faster and avoid dead ends.  \nFrom next position, aim to collect another apple quickly while keeping distance from enemy head. Enemy is far right now, so immediate danger low.\n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nAll three moves are equally safe and get an apple. Let\u2019s pick **UP** to (2, 3) because it keeps me more central with options to go left/right/up afterward, avoiding immediate edge constraints.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Mobility after each safe move:\n\n**UP to (1, 9)**:  \nNext turn moves: UP=off board \u26d4, DOWN=(1, 8) empty \u2705, LEFT=(0, 9) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(2, 9) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\n**LEFT to (0, 8)**:  \nNext turn moves: UP=(0, 9) empty \u2705, DOWN=(0, 7) empty \u2705, LEFT=off board \u26d4, RIGHT=(1, 8) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 8)**:  \nNext turn moves: UP=(2, 9) empty \u2705, DOWN=(2, 7) empty \u2705, LEFT=(1, 8) empty \u2705, RIGHT=(3, 8) apple \u2705 \u2192 4 safe moves.\n\nRIGHT gives best mobility and moves toward apple (3, 8).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy path after next turn:\n\nEnemy at (0, 1) next turn can go UP to (0, 2) (apple), RIGHT to (1, 1) (empty), or DOWN off board (no).  \nThey will likely go UP to eat (0, 2) apple \u2014 that would put them at 17 apples vs my 15.  \nI should aim for (3, 8) apple soon.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Head-on collision risk this turn:\n\nMy moves: (1, 9), (0, 8), (2, 8).  \nEnemy move: (0, 1).  \nNo overlap \u2192 safe.\n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nMove RIGHT to (2, 8) for better mobility and path toward (3, 8) apple. Next turn, go RIGHT to (3, 8) if safe, else UP/DOWN to avoid dead ends. Keep enemy in bottom-left in mind \u2014 they\u2019ll likely take (0, 2) apple soon. Try to match apple count by securing top apples.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t eat an apple, I just moved right from (1,8) to (2,8); that wasn\u2019t an apple cell. So length didn\u2019t change \u2014 still 15 segments.)  \n\n**Apples:** (1, 2), (7, 0), (3, 8), (0, 2), (1, 3)  \nReminder: apple (3,8) is the one close to me now.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (0,1), body wrapping around bottom-left.  \n\nFrom the board:  \n- (3,8) has an apple. That\u2019s one step away from my head (2,8) \u2192 move RIGHT to (3,8) eats it immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Possible moves from (2,8):\n\nUP \u2192 (2,9): empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,7): empty \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,8): my body \u26d4 (that\u2019s my neck)  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,8): apple \u2705 \u2014 and not occupied by enemy body  \n\nRIGHT is safe because eating apple doesn\u2019t kill me (no body collides before eating).  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (0,1):\nEnemy body: [(0, 0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), ...] snake0 body basically blocks most moves. From (0,1):\n\nUP \u2192 (0,2): apple \u2705 and empty  \nRIGHT \u2192 (1,1): empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (0,0): enemy body \u26d4  \nLEFT \u2192 off board \u26d4\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy likely to go UP to eat (0,2) apple (16\u219217 apples) or maybe RIGHT to (1,1) if avoiding confrontation.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (0,2), then next turn they are close to apples at (1,2) and (1,3).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Immediate consideration:  \nEating apple (3,8) with RIGHT gets me to 16 apples (vs enemy either 16 or 17 depending if they eat apple (0,2)).  \n\nAlso, after eating apple (3,8), my length becomes 16, new tail stays where it was; I need to check next turn mobility.\n\n---\n\n**After RIGHT to (3,8):**  \nNew head at (3,8), body:  \n[(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),...,(7,4)] + growth so tail remains (7,4) one more turn.  \n\nNext turn possible moves from (3,8):  \nUP (3,9): empty  \nDOWN (3,7): empty  \nLEFT (2,8): my body \u26d4 \u2014 neck  \nRIGHT (4,8): empty  \n\nSo after eating, I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2014 not trapped.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative moves without eating apple this turn:**  \n\nUP to (2,9): far from apples, fewer options next turn (UP off board, left/right/down maybe).  \n\nDOWN to (2,7): safe but away from immediate apple.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN delay eating apple (3,8), possibly letting enemy catch up in apples or risk them getting more by clearing bottom apples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Head-on collision risk this turn:  \nEnemy possible moves: (0,2) and (1,1). If I go RIGHT to (3,8), no overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2014 so safe.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term:  \nIf I eat apple (3,8), I\u2019ll be at 16 apples (enemy likely 17 after eating (0,2)). Next closest apple to me after (3,8) is probably (1,3) or (1,2), but they are near enemy. Alternatively, apple (7,0) is far and near enemy territory. Might need to plan route to top-left apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Best move:** RIGHT to eat the apple (3,8) and keep pace with enemy score.  \n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nAfter eating (3,8), assess path to (1,3)/(1,2) if safe relative to enemy head position. If enemy is at (0,2), going to (1,3) risks head-on; maybe go to (4,8) then toward middle/top to find safer route. Monitor enemy moves; they are longer, so more confined. Use my mobility to secure apples without direct confrontation.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Apple (7, 0) far and near enemy body.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 8), next turn I can go UP to (4, 9), RIGHT to (5, 8) to eat apple in 2 turns. That\u2019s a good safe path.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3, 9): limited next moves (RIGHT/LEFT only), might get cornered.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7): moves me away from apples, into area more constrained by my own long body.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:** RIGHT to (4, 8) to set up path to (5, 8) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nAfter RIGHT, aim for (5, 8) apple. Watch enemy; if they go to (1, 2) apple, they\u2019ll be at 18, so I need to catch up. Possibly after (5, 8), head toward (8, 8) or (7, 0) depending on enemy position.

No wait \u2014 check: in the before-state last turn, head was (4, 8), apple at (5, 8), I chose RIGHT to (5, 8) (that\u2019s wrong \u2014 if I was at (4,8) and went RIGHT, I\u2019d go to (5,8) which had the apple \u2014 so now my head is at (5,8) after eating that apple? Actually the board state shows \u201cHead: (5,8)\u201d at the top, so indeed apple at (5,8) was eaten. So now body length 18, apples now 18.\n\nActually above it says: \"Apples collected: 17\" in the fixed description \u2014 so is that before or after eating apple at (5,8)? \"... last move information ... RIGHT ...\" then shows \"HEAD: (5,8) ... apples collected: 17\" \u2014 that means my head is updated to (5,8) but score not yet incremented because it's the start of next turn? Actually the game state at the top is after last turn's move (head moved to (5,8)), but the apple count increases after you actually finish movement phase and eat, so in the game state they show the new head position and the apple count still reflects before the move? Or maybe I miscalculated: maybe apple (5,8) wasn\u2019t there \u2014 oh indeed, looking at the board diagram: at y=8: ... T T T T 1 . . A . \u2014 my head at (5,8) is shown as \u201c1\u201d, apple at (8,8) is \u201cA\u201d. So last turn I moved from (4,8) to (5,8) to an empty square, not an apple. So I was wrong in my earlier rationale \u2014 there was no apple at (5,8). Yes \u2014 that\u2019s the error in the last rationale \u2014 the apples listed at the top are only those on the board: (7,0),(8,8),(3,7),(6,5),(0,6). So (5,8) wasn\u2019t an apple.\n\nSo last turn\u2019s rationale incorrectly thought there was an apple at (5,8), but I still moved RIGHT because only LEFT was unsafe, so the choice was fine.\n\n---\n\n**This turn:** Snake head at (5, 8).  \n**My body:** [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)].  \nLength 18 segments (17 apples eaten).\n\n**Enemy snake head:** (1, 2) (no, wait \u2014 check: Snake #0 Head: (1,3) now?)  \nLooking: In the \u201cBefore last move\u201d info, enemy head was (1, 2). The board state snake #0 head is at y=3: \u201c. 0 T . . . . T T T\u201d at x=1,y=3? Actually in board: \u201c3 . 0 T . . . . T T T\u201d \u2014 yes! So enemy head at x=1, y=3.  \nSo enemy must have eaten apple at (1,3) last turn (because they had only up move to (1,3) and apple was there), so they grew: length was 19 segments before the move, now 20 segments, apples 20.  \n\n**Apples now:** Removed apple at (1,3), so apples: (7,0),(8,8),(3,7),(6,5),(0,6) as listed.\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (5, 8):**  \n- UP (5, 9): empty. Safe.  \n- DOWN (5, 7): empty. Safe.  \n- LEFT (4, 8): my body segment (3rd segment behind head). Not safe.  \n- RIGHT (6, 8): empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (1,3):**  \nAdjacent squares: (1,4) empty, (1,2) their body, (0,3) empty, (2,3) my body. So their safe moves: UP to (1,4), LEFT to (0,3).  \nThey can\u2019t collide with me this turn \u2014 distance too large.\n\n---\n\n**Nearby apples:**  \n(8,8) 3 moves away if I go right then up etc. (3,7) far away on enemy side. (6,5) could be reached in few moves: from (5,8) down to (5,7) then (6,7) then (6,6) then (6,5) \u2014 maybe too slow. (0,6) too far and near enemy.  \n\nBetter immediate apple: (8,8) accessible if I go RIGHT now to (6,8), then maybe UP to (6,9), then RIGHT toward (8,9) then down to (8,8).  \nIf I go UP now to (5,9), I can go RIGHT to (6,9) similarly.  \n\nBut UP now preserves more options: from (5,9), I can go RIGHT toward (8,8) or even down later.  \n\nBut let\u2019s check future moves:  \n- If UP to (5,9): next turn options: UP none (off board), so only RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT (4,9)? But (4,9) is empty but then maybe limited. Actually from (5,9): moves: LEFT(4,9) empty, RIGHT(6,9) empty, DOWN(5,8) my body (old neck) unsafe. So from (5,9) next turn only LEFT and RIGHT safe \u2014 that\u2019s risky.  \n\n- If DOWN to (5,7): next turn: UP back to (5,8) (body), DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT(4,7) empty, RIGHT(6,7) empty. So three options \u2014 more future flexibility.  \n\n- If RIGHT to (6,8): next turn: UP(6,9) empty, DOWN(6,7) empty, LEFT(5,8) body, RIGHT(7,8) empty. Three options.  \n\nSo UP is worse next turn (only 2 moves). So avoid UP now.\n\n**Choose between RIGHT and DOWN.**  \n\nRIGHT goes toward (8,8) apple.  \nDOWN goes toward center and possibly (6,5) apple later.  \n\nBut (8,8) is nearer and safer path: no enemy near.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn enemy location possibilities:**  \nEnemy at (1,3) going to (1,4) or (0,3). Either way they\u2019re far from top-right for several turns.  \n\nPlan: RIGHT to (6,8), next turn UP to (6,9), then RIGHT to (7,9), then RIGHT to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8) to eat apple in 4 turns. Safe path likely.\n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nMove toward the (8,8) apple via the top edge to avoid enemy. After eating it, consider looping down the right side toward (7,0) if still there. Avoid enemy\u2019s territory left side.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Wait enemy body: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), ...], so (1, 5) is empty. Actually no \u2014 check: enemy head (0, 5), body: [(0,4), (1,4), ...], so (1,5) not in body \u2014 yes safe. So actually enemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nThey might go for (0, 6) apple, moving away from me. No immediate collision threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:**  \nRIGHT (8, 7) is safe but next turn fewer options.  \nLEFT (6, 7) fewer options too.  \nDOWN (7, 6) gives more flexibility and moves me toward (6, 5) apple area.\n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nMove DOWN toward (6, 5) apple while keeping space open. Next turn, consider LEFT to (6, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 6) based on safety. Avoid trapping near enemy's long body in bottom-left.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n\nDOWN",

That makes sense: old length was 18 body + head = 19 segments total; after eating apple, length = 20 segments total (head + 19 body segments).  \n\nMeaning body is: (neck) (6, 6), then old body minus last segment is kept, and final segment (3, 2) is duplicated? Actually \u2014 given body list in current state: 18 segments, plus head = 19 total. Wait, that\u2019s inconsistent \u2014 they wrote \"Apples collected: 18\" so they couldn't have grown last turn? No \u2014 they grew last turn, so now apples collected = 19 (but they wrote 18 \u2014 maybe a typo in provided state? Let's ignore that, trust coordinates.)  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (6, 5):**\n\n- **UP (6, 6)**: My neck segment (first body segment) \u2014 unsafe. \u274c  \n- **DOWN (6, 4)**: Empty \u2014 safe. \u2705  \n- **LEFT (5, 5)**: Empty \u2014 safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT (7, 5)**: Empty \u2014 safe. \u2705  \n\nSo safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn safety check:**\n\n- **DOWN (6, 4)**: Next moves: UP (6, 5) old head unsafe, DOWN (6, 3) empty, LEFT (5, 4) empty, RIGHT (7, 4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). \u2705  \n- **LEFT (5, 5)**: Next moves: UP (5, 6) my body? body has (6,6), (7,6), etc. No, (5,6) is empty. Let's check carefully: body coords list: (6,6) exists, but not (5,6). So UP (5,6) empty, DOWN (5,4) empty, LEFT (4,5) empty, RIGHT (6,5) old head unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). \u2705  \n- **RIGHT (7, 5)**: Next moves: UP (7,6) my body  \u274c, DOWN (7,4) empty, LEFT (6,5) old head unsafe, RIGHT (8,5) empty \u2192 only DOWN and RIGHT safe \u2192 2 safe moves next turn. Less flexible.  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are better than RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (5, 7) apple: requires going LEFT then UP then maybe RIGHT?   \nActually from (5, 5): UP (5, 6), then UP (5, 7) eats apple.  \nFrom (6, 4): further away.  \n\n**Enemy head (0, 8)** \u2014 possible moves: UP off board  \u274c, DOWN (0, 7) enemy body  \u274c, LEFT off board  \u274c, RIGHT (1, 8) my body  \u274c \u2014 wait, my body has (1, 8) \u2014 yes, so enemy has no safe moves! Enemy will die this turn.  \n\nIf true, then I win immediately if I survive this turn.  \n\nCheck enemy body: (0, 7) is second segment, so (0,7) not safe for enemy head. But maybe they can go RIGHT (1,8)? My body at (1,8) \u2014 enemy hits my body and dies unless my head moves into same cell which is head-on collision. But enemy can't go anywhere without hitting body or wall except possibly RIGHT (1,8)? That\u2019s my body, so yes enemy dies.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy head at (0,8): moves:  \nUP (0,9) empty \u2014 that\u2019s valid! I mistakenly thought y=9 top edge? It's 10x10 board, so y=0..9, so y=9 is valid. Yes! So enemy can go UP (0,9) safely. Also RIGHT (1,8) is my body but my head is not there unless I move LEFT then UP \u2014 but anyway, enemy has safe move UP.  \n\nSo enemy won't die this turn necessarily.  \n\n---\n\n**Strategy:** Since enemy likely goes UP (0,9), they stay far away. I should aim to eat apples safely.  \n\nLEFT (5,5) sets me up well to eat (5,7) apple in two turns while keeping options open.  \n\nRIGHT (7,5) less safe future moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:** LEFT seems optimal \u2014 toward apple (5,7) and 3 safe moves next turn, safe now.  \n\n---\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nEnemy is far away. Move toward (5,7) apple via LEFT then UP. After that apple, maybe go for (3,7) apple using available space in bottom-left area. Keep flexibility.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n\nLEFT",

So to reach (3, 7) from (4, 7): I would go LEFT to (3, 7), not UP \u2014 that\u2019s fine.  \nApple (3, 7) is two steps away via:  \nLEFT now (4, 7) \u2192 LEFT next turn (3, 7) apple directly.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake #0** at (2, 9):  \nPossible moves from (2, 9):\n- UP (2, 10) off board \u274c\n- DOWN (2, 8) \u2014 my body? Check: my body list: (2, 8) is my body \u2192 yes, it would die if it goes there.\n- LEFT (1, 9) \u2014 its own body \u274c\n- RIGHT (3, 9) \u2014 board empty \u2705 safe for enemy\n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (3, 9). That is away from apple (3, 7): apple (3, 7) is below (3, 9). Enemy would have to go DOWN next turn to get it, but I can get (3, 7) next turn before it can.\n\n---\n\n**Compare RIGHT vs LEFT:**\n**LEFT (4, 7):**\n- Gets me closer to apple (3, 7)\n- Next turn from (4, 7): moves: UP (4, 8) body \u274c, DOWN (4, 6) empty \u2705, LEFT (3, 7) apple \u2705, RIGHT (5, 7) empty but was head now empty \u2705 \u2014 so 3 safe moves next turn.\n- Enemy less likely to interfere \u2014 will be at (3, 9) and can't get (3, 7) before me if I go LEFT now.\n\n**RIGHT (6, 7):**\n- Takes me toward apples (8, 6) or (8, 8) but both are further.\n- Next turn from (6, 7): possible moves: DOWN (6, 6) body \u274c, LEFT (5, 7) empty \u2705, RIGHT (7, 7) body \u274c, UP (6, 8) body \u274c \u2014 only 1 safe move (LEFT) next turn. Dangerously limiting.\n\nRIGHT is bad \u2014 only 1 safe next move.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT is clearly better \u2014 enables apple capture next turn, more options afterward, avoids trap.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Go LEFT to (4, 7), then next turn eat apple (3, 7). After that, move to open space downward/left to avoid body.\n\nLEFT",

Not safe.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** Check board state \u2013 appears empty. Not my body, not enemy body. \u2705 **Safe**.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Check board state \u2013 appears empty. \u2705 **Safe**.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** This is my neck/body segment directly behind my head. \u274c **DEATH**. Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves are **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n*   **Head:** (4, 9)\n*   From there, enemy's possible moves:\n    *   UP (4, 10): Off board \u274c\n    *   DOWN (4, 8): Contains my body (4,8) \u274c\n    *   LEFT (3, 9): Contains enemy's own body \u274c\n    *   RIGHT (5, 9): Empty \u2705\nEnemy's only safe move is RIGHT to (5,9). This means the enemy is moving away from me and there is **no risk of a head-on collision** this turn.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n*   (3, 0) is far away, bottom left.\n*   (7, 0) is far away, bottom right.\n*   (7, 4) is closer, middle-right.\n*   (8, 6) is top-right.\n*   (8, 8) is top-right.\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 0), but it's far south. Getting there requires moving down and left. The move **DOWN** from (3,7) to (3,6) starts heading in that general direction. The move **LEFT** to (2,7) is perpendicular to the direct path.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\nFrom (3, 6) [after DOWN]:\n*   Can go UP (back to 3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6). All four directions need checking next turn, but initial scan shows good open space below and left.\nFrom (2, 7) [after LEFT]:\n*   Can go UP (2,8) <- my body \u274c, DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7) <- my body \u274c, RIGHT (3,7). This leaves only 2 safe moves next turn, trapping me slightly.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT leads to a more constrained position next turn with only 2 exits. DOWN leads to a more open area (towards the bottom-left apples) and likely more options next move. Since the enemy is moving away and no immediate apple is adjacent, prioritizing open space and future mobility is better than taking a path that immediately reduces options.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move DOWN to (3,6) to open up movement options towards the lower-left quadrant and the apple at (3,0), while maintaining distance from the enemy in the top-right.\n\nDOWN",

Key nearby segments: (3,7) neck, (4,7), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), etc. Also note my body occupies (1,6), (1,5), (2,5) to the left/down-left.\n\n**Enemy Snake (#0):**\n- Head: (5, 9)\n- Body: Wraps around the top and left edges. Its neck is at (4,9).\n\n**Apples:** (7,0), (8,8), (8,6), (3,0), (7,4)\n\n**Possible Moves from (3,6):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** This is my neck/body segment directly behind my head. \u274c **DEATH**. Not safe.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 5):** Check board state \u2013 appears empty. Not my body, not enemy body. \u2705 **Safe**.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 6):** Check board state \u2013 appears empty. \u2705 **Safe**.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 6):** Check board state \u2013 appears empty. \u2705 **Safe**.\n\nSo safe moves are **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Possible Moves from (5,9):**\n*   UP (5,10): Off board \u274c\n*   DOWN (5,8): Contains my body segment (5,8) \u274c\n*   LEFT (4,9): Contains enemy's own body \u274c\n*   RIGHT (6,9): Empty \u2705\nEnemy's only safe move is RIGHT to (6,9). This moves it further away from me. **No risk of head-on collision this turn.**\n\n**Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\nThe closest apples are (3,0) and (7,4). (3,0) is directly south, but getting there requires navigating through my own body which is currently blocking a direct path down the left side (body at (1,5), (2,5), (1,6), etc.). (7,4) is to the right and down.\n\n**Future Mobility Analysis:**\n*   **DOWN to (3,5):**\n    *   Next moves from (3,5): UP (3,6) <- my body? Wait, is (3,6) my current head? No, after moving, my head will be at (3,5), so the body will be at (3,6). So UP would be suicide. So from (3,5), UP is not safe. DOWN (3,4) is open. LEFT (2,5) is my body \u274c. RIGHT (4,5) is open. So from (3,5), I'd have 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). This is a bit constrained.\n*   **LEFT to (2,6):**\n    *   Next moves from (2,6): UP (2,7) is open. DOWN (2,5) is my body \u274c. LEFT (1,6) is my body \u274c. RIGHT (3,6) is my new neck/body \u274c. So from (2,6), only UP is safe. That's a trap (only one exit). \u274c Very dangerous.\n*   **RIGHT to (4,6):**\n    *   Next moves from (4,6): UP (4,7) is my body \u274c. DOWN (4,5) is open. LEFT (3,6) is my new neck/body \u274c. RIGHT (5,6) is open. So from (4,6), I'd have 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). This is similar to the DOWN option but moves me closer to the apples (7,4) and (8,6). It also keeps me away from the tangled body on the left.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT leads to an immediate dead-end next turn with only one exit, which is too risky. DOWN and RIGHT both offer 2 exits next turn. RIGHT seems preferable because it moves me towards the cluster of apples in the right half of the board ((7,4), (8,6), (8,8)) and away from the complex body situation on the left. The enemy is moving to (6,9), so there's a gap between us. Moving RIGHT feels like it opens up more of the board.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move RIGHT to (4,6) to approach the apples on the right side (7,4) is the immediate target) while maintaining at least two escape routes. Avoid the left side where my body creates a maze.\n\nRIGHT",

Prioritize collecting the nearest reachable apple (8,6) before expanding further.\n\nRIGHT",

Yes, (4,6) is my neck/body segment \u2192 \u274c Suicide.  \n2. **DOWN (4, 4)** \u2192 Check board: appears empty \u2192 \u2705 Safe.  \n3. **LEFT (3, 5)** \u2192 Check board: appears empty \u2192 \u2705 Safe.  \n4. **RIGHT (5, 5)** \u2192 Check board: my body segment (5,5) is there \u2192 \u274c Suicide.  \n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7,9) and collision risk\n\nEnemy Snake #0 head at (7,9), neck at (6,9).  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP (7,10) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- DOWN (7,8) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6,9) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT (8,9) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is **DOWN** to (7,8).  \n\nThat means no head-on collision possible for me this turn since enemy is far away at top edge.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Future mobility after each safe move\n\n**Option DOWN (4,4):**  \nFrom (4,4):  \n- UP (4,5) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n- DOWN (4,3) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- LEFT (3,4) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- RIGHT (5,4) \u2192 open \u2705  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n**Option LEFT (3,5):**  \nFrom (3,5):  \n- UP (3,6) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- DOWN (3,4) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- LEFT (2,5) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- RIGHT (4,5) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n\nSo 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 still okay, but slightly less than DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Apple proximity\n\n- (7,4) apple: from (4,5), moving DOWN gets me slightly further from it, but not by much. Moving LEFT gets me closer to (3,0) apple but that\u2019s far.  \n- Actually, (7,4) is east and slightly south of current position. Moving DOWN to (4,4) then next turn could go RIGHT (5,4) etc., which is a path toward (7,4). Moving LEFT to (3,5) goes away from (7,4).  \n\nGiven enemy is at top-right and apples at (8,8) and (8,6) are near enemy\u2019s area, maybe safer to go for (7,4) apple.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Avoid potential traps\n\nBoard is getting crowded with long bodies.  \nLEFT (3,5) puts me near my body winding around top-left area, might reduce future options if I get encircled.  \nDOWN (4,4) is more central and open space below.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN offers better mobility next turn (3 options vs 2) and aligns with path toward (7,4) apple while avoiding enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

Yes, (4,5) is my body segment \u2192 \u274c Suicide.  \n2. **DOWN (4, 3)** \u2192 Check board: appears empty \u2192 \u2705 Safe.  \n3. **LEFT (3, 4)** \u2192 Check board: appears empty \u2192 \u2705 Safe.  \n4. **RIGHT (5, 4)** \u2192 Check board: appears empty \u2192 \u2705 Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT**.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8,9)  \n\nEnemy Snake #0 head at (8,9), neck at (7,9).  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP (8,10) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- DOWN (8,8) \u2192 apple there \u2705  \n- LEFT (7,9) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT (9,9) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is **DOWN** to (8,8) \u2014 eats apple there.  \n\nThat means enemy will move away from my area, so no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Future mobility after each safe move  \n\n**DOWN (4,3):**  \nFrom (4,3):  \n- UP (4,4) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n- DOWN (4,2) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- LEFT (3,3) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- RIGHT (5,3) \u2192 open \u2705  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn \u2192 good.  \n\n**LEFT (3,4):**  \nFrom (3,4):  \n- UP (3,5) \u2192 body segment \u274c  \n- DOWN (3,3) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- LEFT (2,4) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- RIGHT (4,4) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n\nSo 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 less than DOWN.  \n\n**RIGHT (5,4):**  \nFrom (5,4):  \n- UP (5,5) \u2192 body segment \u274c  \n- DOWN (5,3) \u2192 open \u2705  \n- LEFT (4,4) \u2192 neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT (6,4) \u2192 open \u2705  \n\nSo 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 less than DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Apple proximity  \n\n- Closest apple to (4,4) is (7,4) \u2014 3 steps away horizontally.  \n- Moving RIGHT (5,4) gets me closer to (7,4).  \n- Moving DOWN (4,3) slightly away from (7,4) but opens path to (7,0) apple later maybe.  \n- Enemy will take (8,8) apple this turn, so apples at (8,8) and (8,6) will be gone soon.  \n- Remaining apples after this turn: (7,0), (3,0), (7,4) if enemy eats (8,8) only.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Long-term positioning  \n\nMy body occupies top-left region heavily. Moving LEFT (3,4) puts me near crowded body area, might trap me later.  \nRIGHT (5,4) goes toward more open central area and toward apple (7,4).  \nDOWN (4,3) keeps central position and good mobility.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away, RIGHT seems best for apple gathering without sacrificing too much safety.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**  \n- Aim for (7,4) apple while avoiding getting trapped by my own body.  \n- Keep enemy\u2019s position in mind \u2014 they are top-right, likely moving down toward (8,8) apple.  \n- Prefer moves that keep at least 2 exits next turn.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check: last move was RIGHT from (4,4) to (5,4)? Actually last turn I was at (4,4) and moved RIGHT to (5,4)? Let's check body:  \nBody: [(4,4), (4,5), ...] \u2192 yes, neck is (4,4), so last move was RIGHT.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- **UP** (5,5): body segment at (5,5)? Check body list: (5,5) is in body \u2192 \u274c unsafe.\n- **DOWN** (5,3): empty? Board shows empty at (5,3) \u2192 \u2705 safe.\n- **LEFT** (4,4): neck \u2192 \u274c unsafe (backwards into neck is suicide).\n- **RIGHT** (6,4): empty? Board shows empty \u2192 \u2705 safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy snake #0 position and likely move**\n\nEnemy head: (8,8)  \nNeck: (8,9) \u2192 so last move was DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8).\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (8,8):\n\n- UP (8,9): neck \u2192 \u274c\n- DOWN (8,7): empty? Board shows empty \u2192 \u2705\n- LEFT (7,8): empty? Board shows empty \u2192 \u2705\n- RIGHT (9,8): off board \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN (8,7), it\u2019s closer to apple (8,6).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT (7,8), it\u2019s closer to apple (7,4) maybe? Actually (7,8) to (7,4) is far, but maybe it\u2019s heading toward center.\n\nLikely enemy goes DOWN to (8,7) to eat apple (8,6) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apples available**\n\nApples: (7,0), (8,6), (3,0), (7,4), (9,1)\n\n- Closest to me: (7,4) is 2 steps away (right then up or something).  \n- (3,0) far away.  \n- (8,6) enemy will likely take.  \n- (9,1) far.  \n- (7,0) far.\n\nSo best apple target: (7,4).\n\n---\n\n**4. Mobility after each safe move**\n\n**RIGHT (6,4):**  \nFrom (6,4):  \n- UP (6,5): body segment? Yes, (6,5) is in my body \u2192 \u274c  \n- DOWN (6,3): open \u2192 \u2705  \n- LEFT (5,4): neck \u2192 \u274c  \n- RIGHT (7,4): apple \u2192 \u2705 but need to check if eating apple is safe next turn after that.\n\nSo from (6,4), only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT). RIGHT leads to apple.\n\n**DOWN (5,3):**  \nFrom (5,3):  \n- UP (5,4): neck \u2192 \u274c  \n- DOWN (5,2): open \u2192 \u2705  \n- LEFT (4,3): open \u2192 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (6,3): open \u2192 \u2705  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn \u2192 better mobility.\n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of head-on collision**\n\nEnemy at (8,8) \u2192 possible moves: DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8).  \nMy possible moves: DOWN to (5,3) or RIGHT to (6,4).  \n\nNo overlap in possible head positions this turn \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term path**\n\nMy body occupies top-left area heavily. Moving DOWN (5,3) gives more space and options. Moving RIGHT (6,4) gets me closer to apple (7,4) but reduces next-turn options slightly.\n\nGiven the game is at turn 80 and I\u2019m behind by 1 apple (20 vs 21), I should prioritize apple gathering but not at the cost of trapping myself.\n\nRIGHT seems slightly more aggressive toward apple. DOWN is safer with more flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision**\n\nEnemy is far, so immediate danger low. I\u2019ll choose RIGHT to go for (7,4) apple next turn, since eating apples is necessary to catch up.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Board shows empty \u2192 \u2705 safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy snake #0 position and likely move**\n\nEnemy head: (8,7)  \nNeck: (8,8) \u2192 last move was DOWN from (8,8) to (8,7).\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (8,7):\n\n- UP (8,8): neck \u2192 \u274c\n- DOWN (8,6): empty?

Risk of head-on collision**\n\nEnemy at (8,7) \u2192 possible moves: DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7).  \nMy possible moves: DOWN to (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,4).  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7,7), my RIGHT to (7,4) is safe \u2014 no overlap.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (8,6), also safe.  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term strategy**\n\nI\u2019m behind by 1 apple (20 vs 21). Eating apples is crucial.  \nRIGHT gets me (7,4) immediately, growing to 21 apples (tying enemy if enemy eats (8,6)).  \nDOWN avoids immediate apple but keeps me flexible.\n\nGiven enemy will likely eat (8,6), I need to catch up \u2014 so eating (7,4) is important.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision**\n\nRIGHT is aggressive but safe and gets an apple, tying the score. Mobility afterward is still good.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (7,4), avoid moving into enemy if it\u2019s nearby; likely enemy will be at (8,6). From (7,4), choose a direction that keeps options open \u2014 maybe UP or DOWN to reposition.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check timing:  \n  Next turn enemy WILL be at (9, 3) before I choose my move \u2192 so I can't go UP from (9, 2) next turn without collision.  \n  Remaining moves next turn: DOWN (9, 1) and LEFT (8, 2) possibly safe \u2014 but (8, 2) is my neck now, but will be empty next turn after I move. Yes, because my body moves forward. Actually my neck (8, 3) becomes my head's old position, but later segments follow. Let's check \u2014 After I move to (9, 2), body: [ (8, 2), (8, 3), ... ] so (8, 2) is now my body segment next turn \u2014 that means LEFT from (9, 2) next turn goes to (8, 2) which is my body \u2192 suicide. So only DOWN from (9, 2) is safe next turn! That's a trap!  \n\nSo RIGHT now gives only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 bad.\n\n---\n\n**4. Safety of other moves**  \n\n**DOWN to (8, 1):**  \nFrom (8, 1) next turn:  \n- UP (8, 2): my body (segment after head moves) \u2192 \u274c  \n- DOWN (8, 0): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 1): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9, 1): empty (but enemy at (9, 3), so not adjacent) \u2192 \u2705  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn \u2014 good.\n\n**LEFT to (7, 2):**  \nFrom (7, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 3): my body? Let's trace: After LEFT to (7, 2), body list: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)...] so (7, 3) not in body. Actually wait: My body segments after head moves:  \nHead to (7, 2), neck (8, 2) becomes 2nd segment, (8, 3) 3rd, etc. So (7, 3) not in body the next turn; it's empty. But UP from (7, 2) \u2192 (7, 3) is safe.  \n\nCheck all:  \nUP (7, 3): safe \u2705  \nDOWN (7, 1): safe \u2705  \nLEFT (6, 2): safe \u2705  \nRIGHT (8, 2): my body segment \u2192 \u274c  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn after LEFT too.\n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity**  \nApples: (7, 0), (3, 0), (9, 1), (2, 3), (1, 6)  \n\nFrom (8, 2):  \n- DOWN (8, 1) \u2014 closer to (7, 0) (2 steps away: LEFT + DOWN)  \n- LEFT (7, 2) \u2014 also 2 steps to (7, 0) (DOWN + LEFT)  \n- RIGHT (9, 2) \u2014 step toward (9, 1)  \n\n---\n\n**6. Decision**  \nRIGHT is risky (only 1 safe move next turn).  \nLEFT and DOWN both give 3 safe moves.  \nApple at (7, 0) is closest; DOWN gets me closer more directly (y=1 vs y=2).  \n\nAlso, if I go DOWN, enemy moves to (9, 3) \u2014 far from me. If I go LEFT, enemy still far.  \nI'll choose **DOWN** for better apple path and avoiding potential future entanglement with enemy near top right.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter eating (7, 0), consider moving toward (3, 0) or (2, 3), keeping enemy's predictable path in mind \u2014 it's constrained along right edge for now.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No \u2014 previous turn enemy was at (9, 2) neck at (9, 3), but this turn's given info says head: (9, 1), body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), ...].  \nSo actually, doesn't matter, but enemy possibly moved DOWN from (9,2) to (9,1) as predicted. Neck is now from (9,2), so enemy can't go UP (9,2).  \n\nFrom (9,1):\n- UP (9,2) is neck \u2192 \u274c  \n- DOWN (9,0) empty? Yes \u2014 \u2705 safe  \n- LEFT (8,1): my body segment (8,1) \u2014 enemy would die if they go there \u2192 \u274c safe for me  \n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 \u274c  \n\nSo enemy will go **DOWN to (9,0)**.\n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN (6,0), enemy going (9,0) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT (5,1) or UP (6,2), no collision risk this turn.\n\n**Next turn safety:**  \n\n**DOWN (6,0) now:**  \nFrom (6,0) next turn:  \n- UP (6,1): body segment? No, that would be new head \u2014 wait, my body is currently at (6,1) only if nothing moves, but after move: snake will be head (6,0), neck (6,1) then (7,1) etc. Actually check: (6,1) will be my neck next if I go DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 so UP is into neck? Wait, DOWN from (6,1) moves head to (6,0), so neck is (6,1), so indeed UP from (6,0) would go into neck \u2192 \u274c unsafe.  \n- DOWN (6,-1): off board \u2192 \u274c  \n- LEFT (5,0): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7,0): has apple \u2014 but is it occupied? empty \u2192 \u2705  \n\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 limited but okay. Also eating apple at (7,0) next turn if I go RIGHT then.  \n\n**LEFT (5,1) now:**  \nFrom (5,1) next turn:  \n- UP (5,2): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- DOWN (5,0): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- LEFT (4,1): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (6,1): neck (previous head) \u2192 \u274c  \nSo 3 safe moves \u2014 good mobility.  \n\n**UP (6,2) now:**  \nFrom (6,2) next turn:  \n- UP (6,3): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- DOWN (6,1): neck \u2192 \u274c  \n- LEFT (5,2): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7,2): empty \u2192 \u2705  \n\nAlso 3 safe moves \u2014 good mobility.  \n\n**Apples:** (7,0), (3,0), (2,3), (1,6), (3,5)  \n\nLEFT or UP keeps mobility good. DOWN gets me closer to apple (7,0) next turn (can go RIGHT to eat it from (6,0)), and avoids enemy since enemy will be at (9,0) then moves away probably.\n\nDownside of LEFT: I move away from nearby apple (7,0) \u2014 but maybe still can get it later. Maybe better to secure apple (7,0) while enemy is on other side.  \n\nLet's test: If I go DOWN now to (6,0), enemy at (9,0). Next turn: I can go RIGHT to (7,0) to eat apple unless enemy goes LEFT to (8,0) and up to same collision? Enemy from (9,0) next turn:  \n- Their possible moves: UP (9,1) neck? Neck is (9,1)? Wait no, if enemy moves to (9,0), neck will be (9,1), so UP is into neck \u2014 \u274c unsafe.  \nSo enemy will go LEFT to (8,0) or stay DOWN off board (dead). Actually DOWN from (9,0) is (9,-1) off board \u2192 \u274c  \nSo enemy's only safe move from (9,0) is LEFT to (8,0).  \n\nSo if I go RIGHT next turn from (6,0) to (7,0) to eat apple, enemy goes to (8,0) \u2014 no collision. That works. Eating apple next turn seems safe.  \n\nThus DOWN \u2192 RIGHT next turn secures apple safely.  \n\nLong-term: Snake #0 is longer, I need apples to catch up. Securing (7,0) next turn is good.  \n\nI'll choose DOWN now to set up eating (7,0) safely next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Let's check enemy's next turn from (8, 0):\n  - Enemy neck: (9, 0) \u2192 so enemy cannot go RIGHT (back to (9, 0)).\n  - Enemy safe moves from (8, 0): UP (8, 1) has my body segment (8, 1) \u2192 \u274c unsafe for enemy; DOWN off board \u274c; LEFT (7, 0) would be my new head if I go RIGHT now \u2014 but enemy wouldn't choose that if I'm there? Actually, if I'm at (7, 0), enemy going LEFT to (7, 0) would cause head-on collision \u2192 both die. But enemy might avoid that if possible. Let's check enemy's other option: only UP and LEFT? UP (8, 1) is my body \u2192 enemy dies. So enemy's only safe move from (8, 0) is LEFT to (7, 0) \u2014 which would cause head-on collision with me if I'm at (7, 0) next turn. So going RIGHT now sets up a guaranteed head-on collision next turn if enemy acts rationally (but enemy might not know? But rules say simultaneous moves \u2014 so next turn, if I'm at (7, 0) and enemy is at (8, 0), and we both choose LEFT/RIGHT towards each other? Actually, from (7, 0) my only safe move next turn is RIGHT to (8, 0) \u2014 but that's into enemy's current position \u2014 wait, enemy will have moved from (8, 0) by then. Let's carefully simulate:\n\nTurn 89: I go RIGHT to (7, 0), enemy goes LEFT to (8, 0).\nTurn 90: My head (7, 0), neck (6, 0). My safe moves: only RIGHT (8, 0) \u2014 because UP (7, 1) body, DOWN off, LEFT neck. Enemy head (8, 0), neck (9, 0). Enemy safe moves: only LEFT (7, 0) \u2014 because UP (8, 1) body, DOWN off, RIGHT neck. So if we both move on turn 90, I go RIGHT to (8, 0), enemy goes LEFT to (7, 0) \u2014 we swap positions, no collision. Wait, head-on collision is when two heads move into same cell. Here we move into each other's previous cell \u2014 that's allowed. So actually no head-on collision. But my move RIGHT on turn 90 to (8, 0) is safe? Check (8, 0) next turn: it's empty (enemy left it). So it's safe. So actually RIGHT now gives me exactly one safe move next turn (RIGHT again), but it's safe and I eat the apple at (7, 0) now.\n\n**Option LEFT (5, 0):**\nFrom (5, 0) next turn:\n- UP (5, 1): empty \u2192 \u2705\n- DOWN: off board \u2192 \u274c\n- LEFT (4, 0): empty \u2192 \u2705\n- RIGHT (6, 0): neck \u2192 \u274c\nSo 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- RIGHT: eat apple now, grow, but next turn only 1 safe move (RIGHT to (8, 0)), then from (8, 0) maybe more options.\n- LEFT: no apple now, but 2 safe moves next turn, moving away from nearby apple.\n\nGiven enemy is longer (23 apples vs my 21), I need to catch up. Eating (7, 0) now is beneficial. The path after eating it seems viable \u2014 after (8, 0), I can go UP to (8, 1) etc., but (8, 1) is my body \u2014 actually no, (8, 1) is my body segment, so from (8, 0) next turn, UP would be unsafe. Let's check:\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (7, 0), then next turn RIGHT to (8, 0):\nFrom (8, 0) on turn 90:\n- UP (8, 1): my body \u2192 \u274c\n- DOWN: off \u2192 \u274c\n- LEFT (7, 0): neck \u2192 \u274c\n- RIGHT (9, 0): empty? Enemy was at (9, 0) turn 89, but moved to (8, 0), so (9, 0) is empty? Actually, enemy body includes (9, 0)? No, enemy head was at (9, 0) turn 89, body: [(9, 1), ...] so (9, 0) is only enemy head, not body. So (9, 0) is free after enemy leaves. So RIGHT to (9, 0) is safe. So from (8, 0) next turn, only RIGHT is safe. That's a corridor \u2014 risky but okay short-term.\n\nLonger term: after (9, 0), I can go UP to (9, 1) \u2014 but (9, 1) is enemy body \u2192 \u274c unsafe. So actually from (9, 0) only RIGHT is off board, LEFT is neck, DOWN off, UP enemy body \u2192 trap! So going RIGHT now leads to a dead end. That's very dangerous.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is safer long-term.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT avoids trap and keeps options open.\n\nLEFT",
