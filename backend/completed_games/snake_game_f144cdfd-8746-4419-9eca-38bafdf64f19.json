If we can force a head-on collision, we win because we have equal apples going in - it'd be a draw at worst, but we might be able to outplay them!\n\nCurrent positions:\n- My head: (2, 4)\n- Enemy head: (2, 2) with body segment at (2, 1)\n\nLooking at my options:\n- UP to (2, 5): Safe, moves me away from enemy, but not aggressive\n- DOWN to (2, 3): Safe, but moving toward enemy's body - risky!\n- LEFT to (1, 4): Safe, but not progressing toward apples\n- RIGHT to (3, 4): Safe, but not progressing toward apples\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. The closest apple to me is at (4, 7). That's up and to the right. But we need to be aggressive since they have the apple lead!\n\nHere's the play: If I go DOWN to (2, 3), I'm moving directly toward their body. If they go UP to (2, 3), we'd be on a collision course! And since we have equal apples, a head-on collision means we both die but it's a draw - which is better than them winning with 1 apple!\n\nBut wait... what if they go RIGHT instead? Then I'd be moving into their body segment at (2, 1) which would kill me. That's not good!\n\nLet me reconsider. If I go UP to (2, 5), I'm moving away from them but positioning myself for future plays. From (2, 5), I could then go RIGHT to (3, 5) or UP to (2, 6) next turn.

It keeps us centered but nudges the action toward the left side, creating a potential funnel without inviting an obvious head-on risk this turn. It also preserves multiple follow-up options and keeps us ready to chase or retreat depending on his move.\n\nIf he presses UP (toward the apple-rich zone above), we\u2019re already offset to the left and can threaten a cross toward (1,4)/(0,4) where an apple sits, while still keeping an escape path open. If he tries to slip LEFT or RIGHT, we maintain flexibility to respond with safe rotations and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nLong-term plan: stay alive first, then look to leverage his position by forcing him into constrained corridors and edging toward the left edge when the opportunity arises. With our 1 apple to his 0, we should aim to create a head-on scenario only when it\u2019s clearly to our advantage and guaranteed to keep us alive.\n\nMove:\nleft",

Moving UP keeps you hugging the left edge, which helps trap possibilities later and positions you to grab the apple at (0,7) soon. It also minimizes risk of a head-on collision this turn. Right would close distance but increases risk of getting boxed in or colliding with unknowns.\n\nShort-term plan: Move UP to (0,6) now.

Higher score lets us push for a head-on if the timing lines up.\n- Staying on the left edge helps us box him in over the next several turns; creates a corridor we can threaten to seal.\n- Less immediate risk of colliding with him this turn compared to moving closer toward his space.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (short window):\n- Use the left wall to force him into tighter spaces; threaten a boxed-in chase where his options shrink.\n- If he heads up toward (3,8) or (3,9), use our extra length to stay behind him and pressure from the flank, forcing him into poor turns.\n- If he ever retreats left toward x=2, we can tighten the gap and aim for a deliberate head-on when we have the advantage in apples and length.\n- Always avoid stepping into his future head path; keep our own body between him and the boundary to sustain a trap.\n\nDecision:\nUP\n\nUP",
