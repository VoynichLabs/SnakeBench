Body: none.\n\nApples: A1=(4, 5), A2=(2, 6), A3=(1, 9), A4=(8, 5), A5=(0, 8).\n\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\n\n**Goal:** Safely move towards an apple, preferably the closest one, while avoiding self-collision or collision with Snake #0.\n\n**1. Analyze immediate threats:**\n*   Self-collision: Since the snake has no body, moving backward (LEFT) is the only potential self-collision danger, but since the snake just started (length 1), moving backward is safe unless the snake moves into the previous position, which is not applicable here as it's turn 0 and the head is (6,5) with no previous positions defining a body segment. The only self-collision risk is hitting the cell *immediately* behind the head if it had length > 1. With length 1, moving backward just moves the head to the previous spot. Since this is the first move, there is no \"previous\" spot to worry about unless we consider the implicit tail maintenance rule, but on turn 0, you can move backward safely if the previous location wasn't defined as the head's starting point (which it is, (6,5)). Standard rule interpretation: if length is 1, any move is safe from self-collision unless it goes off-board.\n\n*   Enemy collision (Snake #0 at (7, 6)):\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 6), Snake #0 might move to (6, 6) (if it moves DOWN) or away.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (6, 4), Snake #0 might move to (6, 4) (if it moves LEFT or UP diagonally, but moves are orthogonal).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 5), Snake #0 might move to (5, 5) (if it moves DOWN).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 5), Snake #0 might move to (7, 5) (if it moves DOWN).\n\n**2. Analyze targets (Apples) and distances from (6, 5):**\n\n| Apple | Coords | Manhattan Distance |\n| :---: | :----: | :----------------: |\n| A1 | (4, 5) | $|6-4| + |5-5| = 2$ |\n| A2 | (2, 6) | $|6-2| + |5-6| = 5$ |\n| A3 | (1, 9) | $|6-1| + |5-9| = 9$ |\n| A4 | (8, 5) | $|6-8| + |5-5| = 2$ |\n| A5 | (0, 8) | $|6-0| + |5-8| = 9$ |\n\nThe closest apples are A1 (4, 5) and A4 (8, 5), distance 2.\n\n**3. Evaluate moves based on proximity to A1 (4, 5) and A4 (8, 5):**\n\n**Snake 1 is at (6, 5). Snake 0 is at (7, 6).**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 5):** Moves towards A1 (4, 5).\n    *   Board bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe (length 1).\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake 0 is at (7, 6). For Snake 0 to hit (5, 5), it must move either DOWN to (7, 5) or LEFT to (6, 6) [Impossible, needs to move orthogonally]. If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (7, 5), no collision. If Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 7), no collision. If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 6) [Error in logic: Snake 0 is at (7,6). If Snake 0 moves LEFT, it goes to (6, 6)]. No collision with (5, 5).\n    *   Safety: Very safe from immediate collision. Leads towards A1.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 5):** Moves away from A1, towards A4 (8, 5) is one step closer.\n    *   Board bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake 0 is at (7, 6). If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (7, 5), this is a **head-on collision**. This move is highly dangerous.\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 6):** Moves towards A2 (2, 6).\n    *   Board bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake 0 is at (7, 6). If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 6), this is a **head-on collision**. This move is highly dangerous.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 4):** Moves towards no close apples immediately (A1 is at (4, 5)).\n    *   Board bounds check: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake 0 is at (7, 6). If Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 7), no collision. If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 6), no collision. If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (8, 6), no collision. If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (7, 5), no collision. This move seems safe regarding head-on collision.\n\n**Conclusion on Collision Avoidance:**\nMoves RIGHT (to (7, 5)) and UP (to (6, 6)) risk immediate head-on collisions depending on Snake 0's optimal move (DOWN or LEFT, respectively). Since Snake 0 is close and we need to prioritize survival, we should avoid these paths if possible.\n\nMoves LEFT (to (5, 5)) and DOWN (to (6, 4)) appear safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n**4. Strategy Selection (Between LEFT and DOWN):**\n*   LEFT to (5, 5): Closes distance to A1 (4, 5). Manhattan distance reduces from 2 to 1.\n*   DOWN to (6, 4): Moves away from closest apples A1 and A4.\n\nMoving LEFT seems strategically superior as it advances towards the nearest target (A1) while maintaining high safety margins (no guaranteed collision next turn).\n\n**Long-term plan:** Aim for Apple (4, 5). If (4, 5) is eaten or becomes too risky, re-evaluate targets, prioritizing the next closest safe approach. Avoid paths that align with Snake 0's current position (7, 6).\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe closest apples are (4, 5) and (8, 5), distance 2. The enemy snake is at (7, 6).\n1. Moving UP to (6, 6) risks collision if Snake #0 moves LEFT to (6, 6).\n2. Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) risks collision if Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7, 5).\n3. Moving LEFT to (5, 5) advances towards (4, 5) and appears safe, as no orthogonal move by Snake #0 at (7, 6) lands it on (5, 5).\n4. Moving DOWN to (6, 4) is safe but doesn't advance towards the nearest targets efficiently.\nI select LEFT to safely pursue apple (4, 5).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Enemy Movement Consideration:**\nSnake #0 Head is at (9, 7). It might target A4 (8, 5) or expand towards the center/left edge. It is far from us. We should focus on the apples in the upper left quadrant: (1, 9) and (0, 8).\n\n**3. Target Selection and Pathing:**\nThe next most valuable apples are (0, 8) and (1, 9). We are currently at (2, 6).\n\n*   Pathing towards (0, 8) requires moving generally Left/Up.\n    *   (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) (4 moves)\n    *   (2, 6) -> (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) (4 moves)\n*   Pathing towards (1, 9) requires moving generally Left/Up.\n    *   (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9) (4 moves)\n    *   (2, 6) -> (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9) (4 moves)\n\nBoth LEFT ((1, 6)) and UP ((2, 7)) are excellent opening moves to approach these apples.\n\nLet's compare LEFT (1, 6) vs UP (2, 7):\n*   If LEFT to (1, 6): We are immediately one step closer to X=0, which is required for both (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n*   If UP to (2, 7): Keeps us centered in the Y direction relative to the targets.\n\nThey seem equally good for advancing towards the cluster. I will choose UP, as it keeps the lowest X coordinate accessible for one more turn, maintaining flexibility in the immediate vicinity of the board center before diving too far left.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue moving towards the cluster near (0, 8) and (1, 9). Prioritize finding a safe sequence of moves to consume both apples sequentially before considering the scattered apples (8, 5) and (5, 3). Ensure no collisions with body or enemy head (though S0 is far).\n\nUP",
