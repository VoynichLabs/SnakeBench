Instead, directly moving DOWN from my current position at (3, 5) is a more efficient move to get to the apple at (2, 7) in fewer turns. This path minimizes risk and time also considering the adversary's position and possible movements.\n\nHowever, having reevaluated, I now see that moving DIRECTLY DOWN would bypass the apple, so moving LEFT first might help me position better for a speedier approach. By moving LEFT to (2, 5), I'm in a better spot to move DOWN to (2, 4) and then RIGHT to (2, 7) thereby claiming the apple faster and safer.
