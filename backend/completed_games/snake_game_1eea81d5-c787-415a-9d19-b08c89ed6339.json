My valid moves are UP to (9, 8), DOWN to (9, 6), and LEFT to (8, 7). Moving RIGHT is invalid (wall).\n\nLet's evaluate the moves based on decreasing distance to the closest apple (5, 6):\n- UP to (9, 8): Distance to (5, 6) becomes |9-5| + |8-6| = 4 + 2 = 6 (increases distance).\n- DOWN to (9, 6): Distance to (5, 6) becomes |9-5| + |6-6| = 4 + 0 = 4 (decreases distance).\n- LEFT to (8, 7): Distance to (5, 6) becomes |8-5| + |7-6| = 3 + 1 = 4 (decreases distance).\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT decrease the distance to the closest apple (5, 6) by 1. The apple (5, 6) is to my left and down. The cluster of apples around (6, 3) and (7, 3) is primarily down and left. The apple at (2, 2) is far to the left and down. All available apples are generally in the lower-left section of the board relative to my current position (9, 7).\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 7) decreases my x-coordinate from 9 to 8, bringing me horizontally closer to all apples whose x-coordinates are 7, 6, 5, and 2. This move reduces the larger component of the distance to the closest apple (the x-distance of 4).\nMoving DOWN to (9, 6) decreases my y-coordinate from 7 to 6, bringing me vertically closer to the closest apple (5, 6) and the apple at (5, 6).\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 2) is far away and not an immediate threat. Both valid moves (DOWN and LEFT) maintain a safe distance from the enemy.\n\nConsidering that the majority of apples, including the closest one, are located significantly to my left, moving LEFT appears to be the most direct way to advance towards the general area of the apples. It also helps reduce the larger component of the Manhattan distance to the closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From my new position (8, 7), I will re-evaluate the distances to all apples, focusing on the closest one at (5, 6). I will choose the move that gets me closer to the target apple while respecting boundaries and avoiding the enemy, which will likely involve moving further left or down.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"
