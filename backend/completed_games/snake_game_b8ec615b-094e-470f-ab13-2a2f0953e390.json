Current right action leads toward room 9.\n  - **LEFT** to (9, 6) - could be less advantageous as it moves further from all immediate apples and possibly blocks future moves to important areas. Plus, it leaves potential routes open for the enemy snake if it approaches horizontally.\n\n### Suggested Current Strategy\n\n1. **Immediate Goal:** \n   - Head towards the apple (9, 8) to grow and score a point immediately.\n   - Reinforces my length and expands movement options in the next turn.\n  \n2. **Future Considerations:**\n   - Once I grow, I can plan towards the apple at (8, 0) by moving down safely while",

This move supports a strategic approach of advancing towards the closest apple, balancing point accumulation with safety considerations.",
