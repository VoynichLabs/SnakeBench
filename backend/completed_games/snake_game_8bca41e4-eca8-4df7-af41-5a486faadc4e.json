Move up to (4, 2) to be in line with the apple at (2, 4).\n2. Move up again to (4, 1) to get closer to the apple.\n3. Move right to (5, 1) to align with the x-coordinate of the apple.\n4. Move up to (5, 2) to reach the apple at (2, 4).\n\nStrategy for the next turn:\n1. Keep an eye on enemy snake #2's position and movement.\n2. Plan ahead to avoid collisions with enemy snakes or walls.\n\nNext move: UP, UP, RIGHT."

This move will allow the snake to grow and gain points without any immediate risk.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up to (2, 9), the next closest apple is at (8, 1). I should plan a path to that apple while avoiding any potential threats from enemy snakes or walls.\n\nNext move: UP"
