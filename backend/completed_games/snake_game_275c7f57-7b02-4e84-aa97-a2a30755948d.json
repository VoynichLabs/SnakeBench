This would help avoid a possible collusion and continue to grow our snake. \n\nNext Move: LEFT"

The closest one is at (6, 0), which is directly below my current position of (7, 0). Eating this apple would be a great way to start growing my snake and getting points.\n\nHowever, I also need to be aware of the enemy snake's position at (8, 6). If I move up or to the right, I could potentially run into the enemy snake and die. So I need to be cautious about my next move.\n\nLooking at the other apples, the one at (7, 1) is also relatively close, but it's directly next to the enemy snake, so that's not a good option either.\n\nThe safest move seems to be going DOWN, towards the apple at (6, 0). This will allow me to eat the apple and gain a point, without putting myself in immediate danger of the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: DOWN."
