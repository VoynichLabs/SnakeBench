It's the ONLY move that allows me to collect an apple this turn\n2. This gives me 8 apples total, putting me well ahead of the enemy (3 apples)\n3. The move is safe - no body segments or other snakes at (6,3)\n4. After collecting the apple, my body will shift: head at (6,3), body at (7,3), (7,2), etc.\n\n## Future Considerations\nAfter this move, I should be careful about:\n- The enemy snake's potential movement toward the apple at (4,6)\n- My snake's length and avoiding getting trapped in tight spaces\n- Planning my next apple target (likely (4,6) or the cluster at (1,2)/(2,2))\n\nLEFT",

Into my own body\n- **DOWN (1,0)**: Safe, moves me to bottom row, but this is away from the nearest apple at (1,9)\n- **RIGHT (2,1)**: Safe, moves me toward the center and opens up more paths\n\n### Decision Logic:\n1. **UP and LEFT are eliminated** - they would kill me immediately\n2. **DOWN vs RIGHT**: Need to consider which gives better path to apples and avoids enemy\n3. Moving DOWN to (1,0) puts me at the bottom row, which is away from the apple at (1,9) directly above me\n4. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) moves me toward the center and maintains flexibility to go up to the apple at (1,9) or toward other apples\n5. The enemy is likely to move UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7), so moving RIGHT to (2,1) avoids getting closer to the enemy\n\n### Path to Apples:\n- From (1,1), I can move UP to (1,9) by going up the left side (if I don't move into my own body)\n- But I can't move UP from here because my body is at (1,2)\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,1) allows me to then move UP to (2,2) (which is occupied by my body) - wait, that's not safe either\n- Let me reconsider the paths...\n\nActually, looking at my body more carefully:\n- My body is: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)]\n- From (1,1), if I move RIGHT to (2,1), then:\n  - I can move UP to (2,2) - but that's my body at (2,2)\n  - I can move RIGHT to (3,1) - that would be safe\n  - From (3,1), I could move UP to (3,2) - but that's my body at (3,2)\n\nIt seems my body is blocking many paths upward from my current position. Let me check the DOWN option:\n- Moving DOWN to (1,0) puts me at the bottom row\n- From (1,0), I could move LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0)\n- This might give me a path to go around my own body\n\nBut actually, the apple at (1,9) is very close and I should try to get it. Let me think about this more carefully...\n\nLooking at the board state again:\n- My body: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)]\n- The apple at (1,9) is at the same x-coordinate as my head (1,1), just 8 cells up\n- To get to (1,9), I need to go UP, but my body is at (1,2) which blocks this path\n\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (2,1), then I can:\n- Move RIGHT to (3,1) (safe)\n- Move UP to (3,2) - but that's my body, so not safe\n- This path is also blocked\n\nLet me check if moving DOWN to (1,0) gives better options:\n- From (1,0), I could move LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0)\n- From (2,0), I could move UP to (2,1) - which would be my current position\n- This doesn't seem to help much either\n\nActually, let me reconsider the RIGHT move more carefully:\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,1) seems safe\n- From there, I can move RIGHT to (3,1) - that's safe\n- From (3,1), I can move RIGHT to (4,1) - that should be safe\n- From (4,1), I can move UP to (4,2) - let me check if that's occupied...\n\nLooking at my body again: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2)]\n- (4,2) is not in my body list, so that should be safe\n- From (4,2), I can move UP to (4,3) - not in my body\n- From (4,3), I can move UP to (4,4) - but that's my body at (4,4)\n\nHmm, this path is also blocked.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe I should focus on which move keeps more future options open rather than trying to plan a specific path to an apple right now.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n- DOWN to (1,0) puts me at the bottom edge, which limits my movement options\n- RIGHT to (2,1) keeps me more in the center of the board, which should give me more flexibility\n\nAlso, considering the enemy:\n- The enemy is at (0,7) and will likely move UP to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,7)\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,1) moves me away from the enemy's potential paths\n- Moving DOWN to (1,0) doesn't really change my distance from the enemy\n\n**RIGHT** - I'll move RIGHT to (2,1) to maintain flexibility and avoid the enemy, even though my path to the nearest apple is blocked by my own body. This move keeps more future options open and positions me better for the other apples on the board.\nRIGHT",

Into my own body\n- **LEFT (2,1)**: DEADLY! Into my own body\n- **DOWN (3,0)**: Safe, moves me to bottom row\n- **RIGHT (4,1)**: Safe, moves me toward the right\n\n### Decision Logic:\n1. **UP and LEFT are eliminated** - they would kill me immediately\n2. **DOWN vs RIGHT**: Need to consider which gives better path to apples and avoids enemy\n3. Moving DOWN to (3,0) puts me at the bottom row, which is away from the apples above me\n4. Moving RIGHT to (4,1) moves me toward the right side of the board\n\n### Path to Apples:\n- The apple at (3,9) is directly above me (same x-coordinate)\n- The apple at (2,8) is one cell to the left and above\n- The apple at (1,9) is two cells to the left and above\n\nHowever, I cannot move UP because my body is at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) which blocks the path directly upward.\n\nLooking at my body segments: [(2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]\n- My body forms a vertical wall from (3,2) up to (3,4)\n- My body then extends right to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), then down to (6,3)\n\nThis means I cannot move UP from my current position (3,1) because (3,2) is my body.\n\nI also cannot move LEFT to (2,1) because that's my body.\n\nFrom my current position, I need to find a way around my own body to reach the apples above.\n\n### Considering the RIGHT move to (4,1):\n- This is safe\n- From (4,1), I can potentially move UP to (4,2) - let me check if that's occupied\n- Looking at my body list: (4,4) is my body, but (4,2) and (4,3) are not in my body\n- So from (4,1), I could move UP to (4,2), then UP to (4,3), then UP to (4,4) - but (4,4) is my body\n- This path is blocked at (4,4)\n\n### Considering the DOWN move to (3,0):\n- This is safe\n- From (3,0), I can move LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0)\n- From (4,0), I can move UP to (4,1) - which brings me back to where I would be if I moved RIGHT first\n- This doesn't seem to provide additional benefit\n\n### Enemy Threats:\n- The enemy is at (1,8) and can move UP to (1,9) or RIGHT to (2,8)\n- If the enemy moves to (2,8), it would be at the same y-coordinate as the apple at (2,8), just one cell to the right\n- If the enemy moves to (1,9), it would eat the apple there\n\n### Decision:\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, I need to consider which move gives me better future options to reach apples while avoiding my own body.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,1) puts me in a better position to potentially move UP and around my body to reach the apples above. From (4,1), I have the path (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> then I need to find a way left to get around my body at (4,4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,0) puts me at the bottom edge, which limits my movement options and doesn't help me get closer to the apples.\n\n**RIGHT** - I'll move RIGHT to (4,1) to maintain flexibility and move toward the right side of the board, which gives me a path around my own body to potentially reach the apples above. This move keeps more future options open and positions me better for the apples at (3,9), (2,8), and (1,9).\n\n**Long-term plan**: I need to find a path around my own body to reach the apples above me. Moving RIGHT to (4,1) is the first step in this direction. From there, I should try to move UP to (4,2), then UP to (4,3), then move LEFT to (3,3) - but wait, (3,3) is my body. Let me reconsider... I need to move further right and then up and then left to get around my body. I should aim to move RIGHT to (5,1) or (6,1) and then UP to get around my body segments at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). I should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements and try to avoid getting blocked by it.\n**END NEW RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Into my own body\n- **DOWN (5,0)**: Safe, moves me to bottom row\n- **RIGHT (6,1)**: Safe, moves me toward the right\n\n### Decision Logic:\n1. **LEFT is eliminated** - it would kill me immediately\n2. **UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT**: Need to consider which gives better path to apples and avoids enemy\n\n### Path to Apples:\n- The apple at (9,3) is at y=3, which is 2 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (8,5) is at y=5, which is 4 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (8,8) is at y=8, which is 7 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (3,9) is at y=9, which is 8 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (1,9) is at y=9, which is 8 cells above my current y=1\n\nLooking at my body segments: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n- My body forms a vertical wall from (3,1) up to (3,4)\n- My body then extends right to (4,4), (5,4)\n- My body is at (5,4), which means I cannot move UP from (5,1) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) because (5,4) is my body\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at my body list, I don't see (5,2) or (5,3) in my body. Let me double-check:\n- My body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n- So (5,2) and (5,3) are NOT in my body\n\nThis means I CAN move UP from (5,1) to (5,2) to (5,3), but then I would be blocked at (5,4) which is my body.\n\n### Considering the UP move to (5,2):\n- This is safe\n- From (5,2), I can move UP to (5,3) (safe)\n- From (5,3), I cannot move UP to (5,4) because that's my body\n- So this path is blocked\n\n### Considering the RIGHT move to (6,1):\n- This is safe\n- From (6,1), I can move UP to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n- The apple at (9,3) is 3 cells to the right and 2 cells up\n- From (6,1), I can move RIGHT to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1), then UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3)\n\n### Considering the DOWN move to (5,0):\n- This is safe\n- From (5,0), I can move LEFT to (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0)\n- From (6,0), I can move UP to (6,1) - which brings me back to where I would be if I moved RIGHT first\n- This doesn't seem to provide additional benefit\n\n### Enemy Threats:\n- The enemy is at (3,8) and can move UP to (3,9), RIGHT to (4,8), or DOWN to (3,7)\n- If the enemy moves to (3,9), it would collect the apple at (3,9)\n- If the enemy moves to (4,8), it would be moving away from the apples and 1 cell closer to the apple at (8,8)\n- If the enemy moves to (3,7), it would be moving away from the apples\n\n### Decision:\nLooking at this more carefully, I realize I need to find a way to get around my own body to reach the apples.\n\nMy body segments are: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n\nFrom my current position (5,1):\n- Moving UP to (5,2) is safe\n- From (5,2), moving UP to (5,3) is safe\n- From (5,3), I cannot move UP to (5,4) because that's my body\n- So from (5,3), I can only move RIGHT to (6,3) or LEFT to (4,3)\n- (4,3) is not in my body list, so LEFT to (4,3) is safe\n- From (4,3), I can move UP to (4,4) - but (4,4) is my body!\n- So this path is blocked\n\nFrom my current position (5,1):\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,1) is safe\n- From (6,1), moving UP to (6,2) is safe\n- From (6,2), moving UP to (6,3) is safe\n- From (6,3), I can move UP to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\nFrom my current position (5,1):\n- Moving DOWN to (5,0) is safe\n- From (5,0), I can move RIGHT to (6,0), then RIGHT to (7,0), then RIGHT to (8,0), etc.\n- From (8,0), I can move UP to (8,1), then UP to (8,2), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\n### Final Decision:\n**RIGHT** - I'll move RIGHT to (6,1) to start working my way around my body toward the apples on the right side. The apple at (9,3) is the nearest apple and is to my right. Moving RIGHT gives me the most flexibility to navigate around my body and reach the apples while avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan**: I need to find a path around my own body to reach the apples above me. Moving RIGHT to (6,1) is the first step in this direction. From there, I should try to move UP to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then UP to (6,4), then I need to find a way to move further right and then up to get around my body segments at (5,4) and (4,4). I should aim to move RIGHT to (7,4) or (8,4) and then UP to get around my body. I should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements and try to avoid getting blocked by it. The apple at (9,3) is the nearest and should be my priority target.\n**END NEW RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Into my own body\n- **DOWN (6,0)**: Safe, moves me to bottom row\n- **RIGHT (7,1)**: Safe, moves me toward the right\n\n### Decision Logic:\n1. **LEFT is eliminated** - it would kill me immediately\n2. **UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT**: Need to consider which gives better path to apples and avoids enemy\n\n### Path to Apples:\n- The apple at (9,3) is at y=3, which is 2 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (8,5) is at y=5, which is 4 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (8,8) is at y=8, which is 7 cells above my current y=1\n- The apple at (1,9) is at y=9, which is 8 cells above my current y=1\n\n### Considering the UP move to (6,2):\n- This is safe\n- From (6,2), I can move UP to (6,3) (safe)\n- From (6,3), I can move UP to (6,4) (safe)\n- From (6,4), I can move UP to (6,5) (safe)\n- From (6,5), I can move RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\n### Considering the RIGHT move to (7,1):\n- This is safe\n- From (7,1), I can move UP to (7,2), then UP to (7,3), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n- The apple at (9,3) is 2 cells to the right and 2 cells up\n- From (7,1), I can move RIGHT to (8,1), then RIGHT to (9,1), then UP to (9,2), then UP to (9,3)\n\n### Considering the DOWN move to (6,0):\n- This is safe\n- From (6,0), I can move LEFT to (5,0) or RIGHT to (7,0)\n- From (7,0), I can move UP to (7,1) - which brings me back to where I would be if I moved RIGHT first\n- This doesn't seem to provide additional benefit\n\n### Enemy Threats:\n- The enemy is at (3,9) and can move RIGHT to (4,9) or LEFT to (2,9)\n- If the enemy moves LEFT to (2,9), it would collect the apple at (1,9)\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,9), it would move away from the apple at (1,9)\n- Either way, the enemy is not a direct threat to the apples on the right side\n\n### Decision:\nLooking at this more carefully, I realize I need to find a way to get around my own body to reach the apples.\n\nMy body segments are: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)]\n\nFrom my current position (6,1):\n- Moving UP to (6,2) is safe\n- From (6,2), moving UP to (6,3) is safe\n- From (6,3), moving UP to (6,4) is safe\n- From (6,4), moving UP to (6,5) is safe\n- From (6,5), I can move RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\nFrom my current position (6,1):\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,1) is safe\n- From (7,1), moving UP to (7,2) is safe\n- From (7,2), moving UP to (7,3) is safe\n- From (7,3), I can move UP to (7,4), then UP to (7,5), etc.\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\nFrom my current position (6,1):\n- Moving DOWN to (6,0) is safe\n- From (6,0), I can move RIGHT to (7,0), then RIGHT to (8,0), then RIGHT to (9,0), etc.\n- From (9,0), I can move UP to (9,1), then UP to (9,2), then UP to (9,3)\n- This gives me a path to move around my body and reach the apples on the right side\n\n### Final Decision:\n**UP** - I'll move UP to (6,2) to start working my way around my body toward the apples on the right side. The apple at (9,3) is the nearest apple and is to my right. Moving UP gives me the most flexibility to navigate around my body and reach the apples while avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan**: I need to find a path around my own body to reach the apples above me. Moving UP to (6,2) is the first step in this direction. From there, I should try to move UP to (6,3), then UP to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), then I need to find a way to move further right and then up to get around my body segments at (5,4) and (4,4). I should also keep an eye on the enemy's movements and try to avoid getting blocked by it. The apple at (9,3) is the nearest and should be my priority target.\n\n**END NEW RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This is the optimal choice because:\n1. It's safe (no obstacles)\n2. I EAT AN APPLE and gain 1 point\n3. After eating, I will be at (9,9) with 20 apples\n4. Although I will be in the corner at (9,9), I will have reached 20 apples\n5. This is the only apple I can reach this turn\n6. DOWN would not give me an apple and would move me away from the apple at (9,9)\n7. I need to prioritize eating apples to reach 30\n\nUP",

This is the optimal choice because:\n1. It's one of two safe moves available (UP and RIGHT are eliminated)\n2. It moves me directly toward the left side of the board where all remaining apples are located\n3. It gives me movement options left, right, down, and up for the next turn\n4. I can continue moving left to reach the apples more quickly\n5. DOWN moves me toward the bottom but doesn't directly advance me toward the apples\n\nLEFT",
