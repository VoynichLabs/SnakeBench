RIGHT to (5,4) puts me closer to the enemy's x=5 column, increasing long-term head-on risk (enemy could follow right) while not advancing toward any apple faster than DOWN.\n- **UP**: Heads away from the (4,1) apple, into empty space; low value since it doesn't open paths to apples and slightly increases enemy proximity risk if the enemy goes UP or RIGHT.\n\nDOWN is strongest: It advances a short, safe path to earn an apple and grow (to length 2 after eating), fostering early growth to compete with the enemy snake (which has 1 apple and length 2). It keeps options open for pivots (e.g., left after eating to aim at (1,3)) and avoids traps or dead-ends.\n\nShort-term plan for future self: Complete the DOWN to (4,1) for first apple/growth, then dodge left/right if needed to avoid enemy in x=4 column (e.g., go left toward (1,3) and (0,6) for quick secondary eats while circling the board's edges for safety). Monitor enemy\u2014prioritize growing to match its size before risking head-to-head.\n\nDOWN",

Post-growth safe moves from (1,3): LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3), UP (1,4).

Enemy seems eastbound; no imminent head-on risk here.

No head-on collision risk this turn\u2014enemy's head won't reach mid-board before my next growth.\n- **Survival Check** (immediate threats):\n  - UP: (2,7) \u2014 Empty, leads directly to apple; safe, no bodies/walls/enemy head.\n  - DOWN: (2,5) \u2014 Own body (tail segment); immediate death (hitting self).\n  - LEFT: (1,6) \u2014 Empty; safe.\n  - RIGHT: (3,6) \u2014 Empty; safe.\n- **Post-Move Considerations**:\n  - UP: Eats (2,7) instantly\u2014grow to length 4, apples to 3; reduces gap slightly. Post-eat at (2,7): multiple exits (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT open); avoids dead-ends; enables quick pivot west toward (0,5)/(0,6) apples without circling back. Enemy at (9,5) or (8,4) poses no immediate threat\u2014mid-board flexibility keeps options for flanking or defense. Highest priority: aggressive growth to close apple lead.\n  - LEFT or RIGHT: Delays apple eat (zigzag back for (2,7)) and offers less clear long-term paths; RIGHT opens mid-west but farther from clusters; LEFT shifts west but may crowd with enemy if it goes LEFT. Lower value\u2014prioritize UP for instant growth.\n- **Strategy Priorities**: Narrow apple gap fast since enemy is elongating and east-bound. UP provides safest immediate eat without traps or self-collision risk. Enemy constrained to vertical/e\u043dwester paths, so mid-west remains open for next pivots.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nPost-UP: Head at (2,7) on turn 16, body [(2,6), (2,5)], apples 3. Evaluate enemy position (likely (9,5) or (8,4)). Next turn (17): Target west for (0,5) \u2014 best path LEFT from (2,7) to (1,7) then DOWN to (1,6) toward (0,6), eating en route if possible. Avoid east if enemy threatens (7,7)/(9,7). Monitor for enemy west pivot\u2014stay flexible, grow to 4-5 apples before central clashes.

Apples: west stack at x=0 (y=6,5,3); east potential (y=7 at x=7,9). West columns mostly open (x=0-2), enemy occupies x=8-9 except future (9,7). Distant apples in east are reachable but enemy is closer/stronger.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (1,8) \u2014 y=8, x=1: Empty in row 8, safe.\n  - DOWN: (1,6) \u2014 y=6, x=1: Row 6: A . T . . . . . . 1 \u2192 x=1 is empty \".\", safe.\n  - LEFT: (0,7) \u2014 y=7, x=0: Row 7: . 0 T . . . . A . A \u2192 x=0 is \".\", safe.\n  - RIGHT: (2,7) \u2014 Directly into own body (next in body list), would die from backwards move. Invalid.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT):\n  - UP: To (1,8), expands north into empty row 8, but moves away from all apples (no immediate eat), risks y-limit at top (y=9), and enemy could snake east. Low priority, less flexible for apple pursuit.\n  - DOWN: To (1,6), stays mid-west, opens row 6 path but no apple here\u2014apple at (0,6) is one step away via LEFT next turn. Keeps options (can still LEFT to (0,6) apple quickly), but slower than LEFT for direct west pivot.\n  - LEFT: To (0,7), advances west to x=0 column (next to (0,6) apple). Immediate prey: next turn DOWN to (0,6) eats apple, growing to 4 apples +1 length, closing enemy gap. Keeps west open (y=0-9 accessible), avoids east risks. High future options\u2014can follow apple chain quickly without detours.\n- **Enemy Prediction**: Enemy likely UP to (9,7) for instant apple eat (to 6 apples), or LEFT to (8,6) scouting east. Either way, their head stays east; they won't threaten west apples immediately. No head-on collision risk in safe moves unless they surprisingly LEFT/DOWN toward center (unlikely; their body blocks DOWN).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nPost-LEFT to (0,7) turn 18, I can DOWN to (0,6) for guaranteed apple (4 apples/1 gain), then reevaluate board. If eaten, body will include new segment behind (likely at old tail position, say ~ (2,4) or wherever discarded); current path west mostly safe, no tight traps. Next moves: from (0,6), DOWN to (0,5) apple if clear (check y=5 x=0: row5 A . T . . . . . . . T \u2192 \".\" at x=1? (0,5) is x=0 y=5 row5 x=0 A, so (0,5) is apple\u2014DOWN eats immediately to 5 apples. Follow DOWN to (0,4) if needed toward (0,3) at y=3. Stay x=0/west to chain eats (aim 5-6 apples by turn 25+), avoid east until enemy weakens or I lead/overtake. Monitor enemy: if they UP for (9,7), they'll grow/be eating, so prioritize speed west; if they go east via (8,6), I could pivot later if west depletes. Watch for boxing\u2014keep y-movement flexible, don't pin against y=0 or side walls early.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake at (8,7) is still ahead (6 apples vs. my 4), with eastern apples at (7,7) and (7,8) vulnerable (likely enemy will move LEFT to (7,7) this turn for an easy eat). Western apples at (0,5) and (0,3) offer a fast chain to overtake; no immediate enemy threat west yet. Other apples at (4,2) and none nearby for me. Board is open west but crowded east/north due to enemy body occupying x=9 y=2-7.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,7) \u2014 Into first body segment (directly behind head), die by hitting own body.\n  - DOWN: (0,5) \u2014 Directly below on apple, in open x=0 with no bodies or off-board issues; safe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,6) \u2014 Off west board edge, die.\n  - RIGHT: (1,6) \u2014 Row 6 x=1 is empty (no body or enemy), would be safe but directly backwards into own body if considering it as such (though not strictly the segment, it's not prohibited by rules since it's not into body).\n  - Only safe: DOWN and RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Eating the apple at (0,5), grows to 5 apples (tying initial with enemy before their likely eat), keeps the western chain alive for rapid growth (next DOWN to (0,4) empty, then (0,3) for another eat). Maintains high flexibility in wide-open x=0 (up/down safe for many turns), avoids eastern risks (enemy body blocks), prevents crowding/traps. Highest priority: Immediate eat, sustains overtaking strategy, no collision risk this turn (enemy far east).\n  - RIGHT: Moves to (1,6), empties nearby apples, but x=1 paths are narrower (only DOWN to (1,5) as follow-up, no immediate eats, risks pinching against walls/enemy if eastbound later). Less aggressive for growth; enemy might eat east apples anyway, leaving me weaker. Avoids west chain but closes quick options. Lower priority: Doesn't eat now, reduces future mobility (x=1- ? has enemy-blocks), potential to swing east later if west depletes.\n- **Enemy Prediction**: Enemy likely LEFT to (7,7) for easy eat (to 7 apples), or possibly UP to (8,8) scouting (7,8) or avoiding captivity. No west threat this turn; their body ties them east. Post-my-DOWN, no direct conflicts; they could block east if I pivot RIGHT later, but west chain outpaces their growth speed. Aim to force a tie/draw via partity or out-eat by turn 25+.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nPost-DOWN to (0,5) (eating to 5 apples, tying initial parity before enemy eats), body extends (new list: (0,5) head, (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6)). Next turn: Immediate DOWN to (0,4) empty, no eat but sets up next (0,3) apple eat to 6 apples by turn 22+. Continue DOWN to (0,2) empty if (0,3) eaten, keeping x=0 west dominance with flexible up/down escapes against y-limits/walls. If western apples depleted (after (0,3)), pivot RIGHT/UP only if enemy is weakened/repeated (eats 10+) and east opens (e.g., enemy dies or leaves x=7-9 gaps)\u2014avoid premature x=1+ moves to prevent body-pinning. Monitor enemy: If they stay east (likely, 6-8 apples by turn 25), keep west aggressive to reach 8-10+ by turn 30; tie/draw win possible if mutual collision deaths. Only go east if west empty and enemy vulnerable (e.g., trapped vertically in x=9), prioritizing apple parity then draw prevention. Adjust post-(0,3) for freedom: loop back up x=0 if needed for north expansion/scouting (0,8-9) vs. east conflicts.\n\nDOWN",

Post-last-DOWN, body is now [(0,5) head, (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6)]. Enemy head remains far east at (7,7), their body blocking x=9 solidly. Apples: (0,3) is ideal next target (two DOWNs away), while east apples ((7,8), (6,9), (8,1)) are likely enemy-bound; (4,2) is mid-board but distant. Current score: 5 vs. enemy's 7\u2014need to close gap fast.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,6) \u2014 Directly into first body segment (0,6), moving backwards counts as hitting self per rules; die.\n  - DOWN: (0,4) \u2014 Open space on board, no bodies or enemy segments; safe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,5) \u2014 Off-board west; die.\n  - RIGHT: (1,5) \u2014 Row y=5 x=1 is empty (no my body, no enemy, not into body); safe, though the segment right behind is (1,7) adjacent above, not collision.\n  - Only safe: DOWN and RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Steps forward to (0,4), keeps x=0 west channel wide-open (flexible up/down turns ahead without wall locks), moves directly toward apple at (0,3) for imminent eat (reach by next turn's DOWN, boosting to 6 apples). Avoids any east crowding/enemy proximity, sustains parity-overtake strategy. Enemy far east poses no head-on risk this turn (they'd need to cross vast board instantly). High priority: Immediate apple progress, maximal future openness (x=0 can zig/zag for 4-5 more moves before y=0 wall).\n  - RIGHT: Shifts to (1,5), neutral on apples (no eat now, (0,3) now indirectly farther via risky backward LEFT), reduces mobility instantly (x=1 paths are narrower; DOWN to y=4 but into potential pinches against my own body/edges, RIGHT only leads deeper east with enemy wall at x=9). Could pivot toward (4,2) later but sacrifices west momentum. Lower priority: No growth this turn, closes off quick eats, increases trap risk if enemy counters eastbound.\n- **Enemy Prediction**: Enemy likely UP to eat (7,8) at (7,8) this turn (easy growth to 8 apples), or possibly LEFT to (6,7) evading traps but missing apple. No west push yet; their vertical x=9 body limits them east/north. Post-my-DOWN, mutual safety maintained\u2014target tie at 8 apples by turn 22-23 if they eat and I chain (0,3).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nEat (0,3) immediately next turn via DOWN to (0,4) this turn and another DOWN, extending to 6 apples. Body grows: estimated [(0,3) head, (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6)]. Follow with DOWN to (0,2) empty if (0,3) eaten, sustaining x=0 dominance; watch for enemy redirection\u2014if they eat (7,8) to 8, I'll be at 6, needing central apples like (4,2) via RIGHT pivot after (0,3) to balance/flee west gaps. Only abandon west if chain depletes (post- (0,3)) and enemy stays trapped east (monitor head behavior); aim for 8-9 apples by turn 25-28 via (4,2)/peripheral apples. Prioritize survival/draw: if apples tie at ~10-12, let mutual deaths/draw; avoid east unless enemy weak (e.g., headed vertical in x=9), sticking to board edges for loops. Reassess near turn 25 if parity holds.\n\nDOWN",

Apples: (0,3) is directly below for an easy eat this turn. Eastern apples ((4,2), (6,9), (2,9), (8,1)) remain; enemy at (7,8) might target (6,9) or (2,9) if they LEFT or UP/DOWN safely. Score gap persistent: 5 vs. 8\u2014eating (0,3) closes to 6 vs. 8. Post-DOWN, head to (0,3), grow by 1 (adding tail segment at current tail (2,7)), so body becomes [(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,7)]. Enemy body looms at x=9, blocking that column.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,5) \u2014 Directly into my own neck/body segment; dies.\n  - DOWN: (0,3) \u2014 Empty cell with apple; safe + growth.\n  - LEFT: (-1,4) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - RIGHT: (1,4) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - Only safe: DOWN (immediate growth) and RIGHT (no growth).\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Moves to (0,3), eats apple \u2192 score 6. Maintains west dominance with open y=0-2 below (potential 2-3 more DOWNs for lingevity). Positions for future zigzags (RIGHT turns into less crowded x=1+ fields) without self/traps. Closes score gap; (0,3) is sole reachable apple this turn. Low risk: enemy (7,8) can't reach west instantly (needs multiple moves); if they eat simultaneouesly, parity improves.\n  - RIGHT: Shifts head to (1,4) \u2192 no eat (0,3 missed, requiring >1 turn detour via risky backward moves into body). Reduces options: x=1 has narrower paths (threat of trapping against enemy x=9 wall or my own body), forcing east pivot prematurely. Worse for growth\u2014delays apple chain, lets enemy widen lead if they eat (e.g., (6,9) via LEFT then UP from (6,8)).\n  - Enemy likely movements: Safe options (UP to (7,9), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8)). Probable LEFT to (6,8) for proximity to (6,9) apple next turn, or RIGHT for x=8 space if avoiding crowd. No head-on risk to me this turn; mutual safety.\n  - Preference: DOWN. High reward (growth + score), sustains mobility/openness, directly pursues eat-while-surviving strategy. Shifting RIGHT fits if dodging enemy, but here it's suboptimal\u2014sacrifices progress for vague east defense.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nEat (0,3) this turn with DOWN \u2192 score 6, body extends west further. Post-eat at (0,3), prioritize downward neck to (0,2) (empty, maintains x=0 channel for 2-3 more turns). Use this to pivot toward mid-board (4,2) via RIGHT at y=2 or 3 (e.g., after DOWN to (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2) then continue east). Monitor enemy: if they eat (6,9) to 9 apples (potential LEFT then UP sequence), maintain west defensibility (loop y=0-3 if trapped) while chasing (4,2) for catch-up to ~7 apples. Abandon west only if body overcrowds x=0 post-growth and enemy stays paralyzed east\u2014aim to reach 8+ apples by turn 24-26 via combined (4,2)+(8,1) chains. Avoid east/west death-loops; prioritize draws over mutual deaths if scores tie >10 apples. Reassess at turn 23 if enemy redirects.\n\nDOWN",

Western x=0 has open path y=0-2 for continued downward mobility and reach to (1,0) apple via zigzags (e.g., DOWN to (0,2) then RIGHT or vice versa). Eastern apples: (4,2), (6,9), (8,1), (2,9); (6,9) likely targeted by enemy this turn. Score: 6 vs. 8; remaining apples may allow ties at 9+ each if both eat. Post-move, maintain west control for longevity, pivot east toward (4,2) after securing lower y. Enemy body walls x=9 and partial x=7-8, blocking direct east clash.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,4) \u2014 Into own body/neck; dies.\n  - DOWN: (0,2) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,3) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - RIGHT: (1,3) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - Only safe: DOWN and RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Head to (0,2), maintains west lane (open y=0-2 for ~3 more turns to (0,0)); positions for (1,0) apple via RIGHT turn (e.g., at (0,0) RIGHT to (1,0) eat). Keeps multiple options (continue down or preempt east to (4,2) at y=2-3). Low enemy collision risk (their head at (7,9) can only reach west gradually via LEFT+DOWN sequence); if they LEFT eat (6,9), I counter toward mid-board. Net: prosecutes west apples, holds east openings, matches last-turn plan.\n  - RIGHT: Head to (1,3), shifts to x=1 mid-board (closer to (1,0) via 2-3 DOWNs, but risks crowding against own (1,7) body). Narrows mobility (east hits x=7-9 wall sooner, potential traps vs. enemy x=8-9 body); delays (4,2) pursuit (deviation from straight west). Worse if enemy eats (6,9)\u2014traps in x=1-3 corridors faster. Suboptimal: sacrifices west freedom for unproven east pivot.\n  - Enemy likely movements: Head at (7,9); DOWN impossible (body), UP off-board/collision with others? Wait, board rows: no one at (7,10). LEFT to (6,9) eats apple safely/at risk of wall, RIGHT to (8,9) expands x=8. Likely LEFT to eat (6,9), blocking (2,9) or continuing north.\n  - Preference: DOWN. Builds on last-turn growth, sustains multi-option freedom, directly targets (1,0) while preparing (4,2) zigzag. RIGHT risks premature east congestion without gains.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nContinue west dominance: DOWN this turn to (0,2) \u2192 turn 23 DOWN to (0,1) if safe, aiming for (0,0) then RIGHT to (1,0) eat (score 7). Post-eat (assuming growth at turn 24-25), RIGHT to (1,y) and north/up to (4,2) zigzag (RIGHT to x=1-4 while ascending y). Chase (4,2)+(8,1) chain (~turns 26-30 for score 9+). Abandon west only if body overcrowds x=0-2 and enemy advances west (e.g., via (8,9)); prioritize ties/draws at 10+ apples, avoid mutual deaths. Reassess turn 23 if enemy eats (6,9) (score 9) \u2014 accelerate to (4,2) without west overcommitment.\n\nDOWN",

Body blocks x=0 y=3-7 and x=1 y=7. Enemy is 10 segments (they ate last turn?), head at (6,9), score now 9 (up from 8, so they ate (6,9) last turn? Wait, apples were (4,2),(8,1),(2,9),(1,0),(3,7)\u2014 (6,9) wasn't listed, maybe miscount, but they have 9 now. Board shows (2,9) still A. Long body occupying east x=9 fully y=3-7, x=8 y=7, x=7 y=7-9. West x=0-2 mostly open down. Remaining apples: (1,0) immediately targetable via west; (4,2) mid West accessible via RIGHT then zigzags; (3,7) upper mid; (2,9),(8,1) east/upper. Enemy score 9, mine 6; chase for 9-10 apples each is possible for ties/draw if game goes long. West dominance (x=0) keeps mobility open\u2014open path down to y=0, then east rotations. Enemy east position threatens (2,9)/(8,1) directly but unlikely west fast without LEFT+DOWNS.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,3) \u2014 Own neck/body; dies.\n  - DOWN: (0,1) \u2014 Empty cell (board row1 x=0 is '.'; no obstacles); safe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,2) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - RIGHT: (1,2) \u2014 Empty cell (board row2 x=1 is '.'; enemy near x=6-9, no immediate threat); safe.\n  - Only safe: DOWN and RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Head to (0,1), extends west dominance (open y=1 then y=0 for ~2 more turns); direct path to (1,0) apple (DOWN again to (0,0), RIGHT to (1,0) eat, score to 7). Maintains broad options post-eat (turn RIGHT at (0,0) to x=1, then UP zigzags toward (4,2)/(3,7)). Low collision risk\u2014enemy head at (6,9) likely LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8) (RIGHT into (7,9) own body dies; UP off; left open), not closing west this turn. Avoids crowding mid-board prematurely. Builds last-turn plan horizontally/via west eats first.\n  - RIGHT: Head to (1,2), shifts to mid x=1 y=2 (closer to (4,2) x=4 y=2, but 3 turns side, while enemy could zigzag faster west from x=6-7). Open follow-ups (RIGHT again to x=2, or DOWN toward (1,0) but now at y=2 vs. y=0, adds detour). Risks tighter spaces soon (enemy x=7-9 blocks east, own body at x=1 y=7 lurks if ascending early); if enemy goes DOWN/left toward mid, could push me west into x=1-2 bottlenecks. Suboptimal without immediate apple gains\u2014delays (1,0) for uncertain (4,2) chase later. Worse if enemy eats this turn (e.g., LEFT+DOWNS to (4,2) eventually).\n  - Enemy likely movements: Head (6,9); likely LEFT to (5,9) (open, avoids body; RIGHT dies into (7,9); DOWN to (6,8) possible but y=9 remains at high y). From (5,9), could continue LEFT toward (2,9) or DOWN+zigzags west. Prioritizes upper apples ((2,9),(8,1),(3,7))? Unlikely immediate west threat; if they target (4,2), zigzags from y=9 would take turns. My west play counters/mitigates.\n  - Preference: DOWN. Aligns with last rationale/west-focused longevity (multi-option mobility, prosecutes (1,0) immediately). RIGHT narrows options without apple access, risks mid-board congestion vs. enemy. If enemy eats again this turn, accelerate east mid-game without overcommitting west now.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nWest primacy continues: DOWN this turn to (0,1) \u2192 turn 24 DOWN to (0,0) (safe, toward (1,0)). Turn 25 RIGHT to (1,0) eat (grow to 8 segments, score 7). Post-eat turn 26 RIGHT to x=1 (grow occupies x=1, open y options), then UP zigzags east (turns 27-29: RIGHT to x=2-4 while ascending y=0-? toward (4,2) eat). Chase chain (4,2 then (3,7) or (8,1)) for score 8-9 (turns ~30-33). Abandon west only if body fills x=0-2 or enemy invades (e.g., crossed x=7 west). Aim for ties at 9+ apples; survive to 150 turns via open avoidance.\n\nDOWN",

Apples remaining: (4,2) west-mid potential; (8,1), (2,9), (3,7) east-upper likely enemy targets; (1,0) immediately accessible south. My score 6 vs. enemy 9; need to eat quickly while maintaining west mobility. No imminent enemy west invasion (head at x=5, path longer).\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,2) \u2014 Own body; dies.\n  - DOWN: (0,0) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - LEFT: (-1,1) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - RIGHT: (1,1) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - Only safe: DOWN and RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (among safe: DOWN, RIGHT):\n  - DOWN: Head to (0,0), continues west dominance (free y=0 for RIGHT eat next turn); direct path to (1,0) apple (then grow, turn options: RIGHT along y=0 for mid-board access or UP zigzags east). Keeps broad mobility; avoids mid-board risks. Enemy unlikely to collide west this turn (e.g., from (5,9), LEFT to (4,9) or DOWN to (5,8), far from x=0).\n  - RIGHT: Head to (1,1), shifts to x=1 y=1 (no immediate apple; (1,0) requires detour DOWN to y=0 then LEFT, inefficient). Risks narrowing space (own body at x=0 y=2-7 behind; enemy could push west later); if enemy zigzags LEFT+DOWNS faster, could force congestion in x=1-2. Delays eats without gains; worse if enemy eats (e.g., toward (2,9)).\n  - Preference: DOWN. Aligns with west-focused plan for immediate eats and longevity; RIGHT reduces options prematurely.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nWest primacy: DOWN this turn to (0,0) for (1,0) setup.

Target chain: (4,2) then RIGHT+UP to (3,7) or LEFT+DOWNS to (8,1).

West board remains open for mobility; no enemy threat west this turn (their head moves LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9), far east).\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (0,1) \u2014 Own body; immediate death.\n  - DOWN: (0,-1) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - LEFT: (-1,0) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - RIGHT: (1,0) \u2014 Empty cell; safe. Additionally, this lands on the (1,0) apple for free eat +1 point.\n  - Only safe move: RIGHT.\n- **Post-Move Considerations**:\n  - RIGHT: Head to (1,0), eat apple (score to 7), grow to 8 segments (body shifts: old head (0,0) becomes body, old body appends (1,0)? Wait, standard snake grow: head moves to apple, tail stays, lengthening by 1. So new body: [(1,0) head, then (0,0), (0,1), ..., (0,6), and new tail at same (0,6), growing the neck]. This maintains west position, opens path rightward for future eats like (4,2). Keeps multiple options (UP/DOWN/LEFT safe from (1,0): UP (1,1) empty, DOWN (1,-1) off-board invalid, LEFT (0,0) own body but that's previous head becoming body? Wait, after shift, (0,0) is now first body, so LEFT to (0,0) would be into own body, dies\u2014safe follow-ups are UP (1,1) empty and RIGHT (2,0) empty). No head-on risk (enemy head can't reach x=1-2 this turn).\n  - No other safe moves; RIGHT is mandatory for survival and gain.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nEat (1,0) this turn to reach 7 apples. Post-eat at (1,0), avoid LEFT (own body suicide). Next turn (26): RIGHT to (2,0) for safety and mid-board access (UP to (1,1) risks open area but own body at x=0 behind). Turn 27: UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0)\u2014check safety then. Target chain: (2,0) or (1,1) to zig RIGHT-UP toward (4,2) eat around turn 30-32, then pivot RIGHT-UP to (3,7) if enemy avoids east. Maintain west escape; if enemy crosses x=5 west, defend mid with RIGHT loops. Aim for 9 apples by turn 40, survive via open west if enemy crowds east.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy #1 is at (3,9), length 10, still in the top-right east/west direction. Apples left: (4,2) is directly reachable via right-up from here, (3,7) in mid-upper, (2,9) near enemy possibly, (8,1) near enemy, (9,5) far east. My score is 7 to enemy 9, open west board for mobility/escape. Enemy likely moving towards (2,9) or (8,1) this turn (possible head moves: LEFT to (3,8), RIGHT (3,10 off), UP (2,9) directly on apple, DOWN (3,8)). No immediate threat to me west of x=5.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (1,1) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n  - DOWN: (1,-1) \u2014 Off-board; dies.\n  - LEFT: (0,0) \u2014 Own body (first after head); dies.\n  - RIGHT: (2,0) \u2014 Empty cell; safe.\n- **Post-Move Considerations**:\n  - RIGHT: Head to (2,0), stays ground level, opens direct RIGHT path to (4,2) (RIGHT to (3,0), RIGHT to (4,0), UP to (4,1), UP to (4,2) ~4 turns), keeps west escape at x=0-1 safe. Follow-ups: Beside RIGHT (3,0), UP (2,1) empty, LEFT to (1,0) (backwards into own body); 2 solid options. No head-on risk (enemy can't reach y=0 or x=3-4 area this turn).\n  - UP: Head to (1,1), shifts to mid-board, potential indirect path to (4,2) but zigzag (RIGHT to (2,1), then up-right longer). Follow-ups: RIGHT (2,1) empty, UP (1,2) empty, LEFT (0,1) own body, DOWN (1,0) backwards; also 2 options. Slightly less direct to apples, but safe\u2014prefer RIGHT for straighter eat path and more options.\n  - Among safe moves, RIGHT better moves me closer to reachable apples (direct right to (4,2)) while keeping openness (OWN west and mid paths); no dead-ends or tight spots. Avoids crowding enemy east.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nAfter RIGHT to (2,0), score remains 7. Turn 27: UP to (2,1) for central access (avoids LEFT suicide; then RIGHT/UP safe). Turn 28: RIGHT to (3,1) or UP (2,2) toward (4,2). Target eat (4,2) by turn 32, then loop back west to avoid enemy crowding east. If enemy eats (2,9)/(8,1), pivot to (3,7) via right-up. Maintain west escape; aim for 8-9 apples by turn 50, survive open west if needed.\n\nRIGHT",

My west base (x=0-1 y=0-3) is open for escapes, but prioritize eating (4,2) to close the score gap without risking deeper enemy incursion. No immediate body collision threats; avoid head-ons if enemy descends.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (4,1) \u2014 Empty; safe.

Positions at (4,1) keep multiple options (RIGHT to (5,1) empty or DOWN back to (4,0) open y=3-4). Minimizes detours; if enemy goes DOWN to (2,6), this pulls me west/up away without trapping. Low head-on risk as enemies aren't near x=4. Follow-ups: From (4,1), UP eats (4,2) next, then turn toward (3,7) or west evades; space remains open in mid-board.\n  - RIGHT to (5,0): Opens x=5 corridor but detours from (4,2) (would need extra LEFT/UP steps, ~3 more turns to eat). Broad x-space mid-bottom keeps options open, but less direct apple progress; potential dead-end if enemy cuts mid while I zigzag. Similar safety, but UP optimizes for immediate scoring and multi-turn efficiency without over-committing eastward.\n  - Favor UP for direct, low-risk apple pursuit on open y=4; maintains west flexibility for evades, sparing x-moves unless enemy closes midfield.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nEat (4,2) by Turn 31 for 8 apples (length 9); monitor enemy\u2014if they eat (3,7) RIGHT (to ~11 apples), pivot west for (0,7) escapes or pursue remaining east apples like (8,1)/(9,5).

Enemy probable moves: RIGHT to (4,7) or DOWN to (3,6) to open mid-west options or threaten y=2-6 corridor. No immediate collision threat this turn (heads not adjacent); avoid committing too far east if enemy descends, prioritizing open mid-left spaces for flexibility.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (4,2) \u2014 Empty (apple present); safe, no body/off-board issues.\n  - DOWN: (4,0) \u2014 Own body (backward); dies.\n  - LEFT: (3,1) \u2014 Board empty at (3,1); safe (adjacent own body at (3,0) but not moving into it).\n  - RIGHT: (5,1) \u2014 Board empty at (5,1); safe.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (UP/RIGHT/LEFT safe; all keep options open to mid-west evades):\n  - UP to (4,2) eat apple: Immediate score to 8 apples (length 9). Positions at (4,2) with 3 options (LEFT to (3,2) open, RIGHT to (5,2) open via empty y=2, DOWN back to (4,1) semi-open). Direct path rewards immediate growth, pulling toward mid-right escapes while y=2-4 corridor opens for future evades. Low head-on risk (enemy far west); if enemy RIGHT to (4,7), keeps distance. From (4,2), follow-UP via LEFT to x=3 for (0,7) pursuit or RIGHT toward (8,1)/(9,5) apples (~4-5 turns after eat).\n  - RIGHT to (5,1): Sideswipes east without eating, detouring 1-2 extra turns from (4,2). Options at (5,1) include UP/DOWN/LEFT back; keeps mid-east open but less efficient scoring vs. UP, risking idle turns if enemy advances mid. Effective if pivoting right for (8,1), but UP prioritizes eat + mid-flexibility.\n  - LEFT to (3,1): Opens west, near own body at (3,0); options include UP (empty y=2 column) or RIGHT back. Solid west evade, but misses (4,2); enemy less likely to threaten here immediately.\n  - Favor UP for low-risk eat + multi-options (3+ safe follow-ups), outpacing enemy potential score. Avoids dead-ends; maintains west escapes if enemy targets y=6.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nAppraised (4,2) for 8 apples by Turn 31 (maintain score gap at 3 vs. enemy 11-12). Monitor enemy: if they RIGHT to (4,7)/DOWN to (3,6), intersect y=7 or descend mid; pivot LEFT (to x=3-0) for (0,7) apple or upward evades in y=1-5. Aim east after for (8,1)/(9,5) by Turn 35-40 (~10-11 apples); stay mid-left (y=2-6, x=0-5) avoiding east traps/enemy body. If enemy nears head-on (e.g. x=4 column), full west dive. Target 12-13 apples by Turn 45, outflanking longer enemy via efficient eats + open paths.\n\nUP",

This outpaces enemy (they can't eat (0,7) this turn due to body blocks; (0,7) path is long/weak for me anyway ~9+ moves). (9,5) and (7,5) farther east. No immediate collision risk (enemy at y=8-9, unlikely to descend to y=1-2 quickly; their safe moves: only RIGHT to (4,8) per current body). Mid-board (y=2-4) has open corridors for evades if enemy shifts down later. Prioritize efficient eats to close apple gap (8 vs. 11) while maintaining east-west flexibility.\n- **Survival Check** (eliminate killing moves):\n  - UP: (4,3) \u2014 Empty; safe.\n  - DOWN: (4,1) \u2014 Own body; dies.\n  - LEFT: (3,2) \u2014 Empty; safe.\n  - RIGHT: (5,2) \u2014 Empty; safe.\n- **Post-Move Considerations** (UP/LEFT/RIGHT safe):\n  - RIGHT to (5,2): Progresses directly toward (8,2)/(8,1) apples (~4-5 moves total for 2 eats); y=2 corridor unconstrained; keeps LEFT/UP options for pivots if enemy intrudes (e.g., they RIGHT to (4,8) then descend). High reward (quick growth to length 11), minimal traps.\n  - UP to (4,3): Starts vertical dodge but takes 7+ moves to (8,1) detour via (8,3)then down; misses immediate apple proximity; decent but farther from fast scoring.\n  - LEFT to (3,2): Opens west evade/route to (0,7) (~9 moves); safer if enemy descends mid but delays eats, potentially letting enemy gap widen if they find quick apples (though tough for them now). Circuitous path risks tighter x=0-3 spaces later.\n  - Favor RIGHT for efficient 2-apple path + multi-options (full evades left/right/up possible post-move); outpaces UP/LEFT in scoring while dodging enemy likely vertical threat.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nQuickly execute RIGHT -> R -> R -> R (eat (8,2), now length 10). Then D (eat (8,1), length 11). Target ~11-12 apples by Turn 40 while staying flexible at y=1-3; monitor enemy descent (if they go RIGHT/DOWN to mid-board, pivot LEFT to x=0-3 evades or further RIGHT to (9,+/-arre5) for next apple). Avoid committing deep east if enemy targets y=5-8 corridor; if enemy waits top, seize (7,5)/(9,5) by Turn 45-50. Maintain >3 apple lead aim.\n\nRIGHT",
