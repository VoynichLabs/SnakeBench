          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for my snake here. The board is 10x10, and I need to make sure I don't die this turn. My head is at (8,4), and the snake has no body. So currently, moving in any direction just needs to avoid walls, apples, and other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples: there's one at (8,5) which is right above the head. If I move up to (8,5), I can collect that apple. That would grow my snake by one segment, which might be good for future moves. But wait, I need to check if moving up is safe. Let me check the next cells.\n\nCurrent head is (8,4). Moving up would take me to (8,5). The apple is there, so that's valid. But I have to make sure that no other snake's head or body is in that position this turn. The enemy snake is at (6,3) and has no body. So (8,5) is safe. Also, moving up is a valid direction.\n\nOther directions: Down would be (8,3). The enemy's head is at (6,3), so that's not directly in the way. But I need to check if moving down would lead to any other issues. The board state shows that (8,3) is empty. So moving down is possible. But where are other apples? The other apples are at (0,7), (6,0), (8,5) (which we're considering), (2,7), (8,8). So moving up gives me the closest apple.\n\nMoving left to (7,4): No immediate issues there, but no apple. Right to (9,4): Let me check. The board's 9th row (from the bottom) is row 9, which is the top row. The coordinate (9,4) is on the top row. The board's 9th line shows (9) as . . . . . . . . . . so that's empty. So right is possible. But again, no apple there.\n\nSo the options are up (to get the apple), down, left, right. All seem safe. But since moving up gets an apple, which is good for points and growth, that's probably the best choice. But wait, what about the enemy? The enemy is at (6,3). If I move up, the enemy moves in their direction. Wait, the enemy's last move was not given here. The last move we made was left. But the enemy's move direction isn't provided. Hmm, but in the current turn, all snakes move simultaneously. So when I choose my direction, the enemy will choose their own. However, since we can't predict the enemy's move, we have to assume they might move in any direction. So in this case, maybe moving up is safe regardless.\n\nBut maybe there's a chance that the enemy could move into (8,5) if I move up. But since the enemy's head is at (6,3), unless they move upwards and rightwards in some combination, they can't reach (8,5) in one move. So moving up to (8,5) should be safe. Also, since I have no body, there's no risk of hitting myself. So moving up is a good option here.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't move up, I might miss that apple. But considering that the other apples are further away, it's better to collect this one now. Also, collecting apples increases the chance to win if the game ends early or allows for more growth. So I think moving up is the best choice here.\nUP",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide the best move for my snake in this turn. The current head is at (8,5) according to the board state. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the problem description, under \"Your snake (ID 1): Head: (8,5)\". But then in the board state, the line for row 5 is \"5 . . . . . . . . 1 .\" which might indicate the snake's head position. But maybe the board is updated after the last move. The last move was UP, which moved from (8,4) to (8,5), collecting the apple there. Now, the current head is at (8,5).\n\nThe apples are at (0,7), (6,0), (2,7), (8,8), (2,0). The closest one is (8,8) which is one unit up from the current head (8,5). So moving up again would take me to (8,6), and then I can collect (8,8) next turn? Wait, but (8,8) is three units up from current position. Wait, (8,5) to (8,8) is three steps up. So next turn, if I move up, I can get to (8,6), then next turn up again to (8,7), then (8,8). But maybe there's a better apple to target.\n\nAlternatively, (0,7) is far away, but maybe there's a path. But given that the board is 10x10, and the snake is just a head and one body part at (8,4), I need to move carefully.\n\nThe goal is to collect apples to get points and reach 30. Since I have 1 apple so far, and the enemy has 0. The game could end if I get 30 or if the enemy does. But since the enemy is currently at (6,2) with no body, maybe they are a threat.\n\nThe previous move was UP, which moved from (8,4) to (8,5), collecting the apple there. Now, the next move options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (8,5).\n\nLet me check each direction:\n\nUP: (8,6). Is that safe? The board's row 6 is shown as \"6 . . . . . . . . . . \" so (8,6) is empty. Also, the enemy is at (6,3). If the enemy moves, say, up or right, they might approach. But I can't predict their move. But if I move up, I need to ensure that (8,6) is not occupied by any other snake's head or body during this turn. Since the enemy's current head is (6,3), unless they move into (8,6), which is two steps right and three up, that's unlikely. So moving up seems safe. Also, moving up would get me closer to (8,8), the next apple.\n\nDOWN: (8,4). But that's where the previous body was. Wait, my body is [(8,4)]. If I move down to (8,4), that's the position of my own body segment. That would cause me to die because I'm moving into my own body. So DOWN is invalid. So that's not an option.\n\nLEFT: (7,5). Let's check if that's safe. The enemy is at (6,3). Moving left to (7,5) doesn't collide with the enemy's current position. Also, the board shows row 7 as \"7 A . A . . . . . . . \" which is (7,0) and (7,2) as apples. So (7,5) is empty. So left is possible. But no apple there.\n\nRIGHT: (9,5). The board's row 5 is \"5 . . . . . . . . 1 . \" which might be the previous position. But (9,5) is on the top edge. The board's 9th line (top) is all dots. So (9,5) is empty. So right is possible. But again, no apple.\n\nSo the options are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is invalid.\n\nNow, considering which of these is best. Moving UP towards (8,6) brings me closer to the apple at (8,8). If I can reach that, I can collect two apples in two moves. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving RIGHT to (9,5) could be part of a strategy to go towards other apples. But (8,8) is three steps up. So moving up each turn would get there in three moves. But perhaps there's a better apple to target. Let's see the apples:\n\n- (8,8) is three steps up from current position.\n- (2,7) is to the left (from 8 to 2 is 6 steps left) and three steps up.\n- (0,7) is even further left and up.\n- (6,0) is down and left.\n- (2,0) is left and down.\n\nThe closest apple is (8,8), so moving up is the best immediate step. But maybe after moving up, the next steps would be to go towards that apple. However, I need to avoid the enemy. The enemy is at (6,2). If I keep moving up, maybe the enemy could move towards me. But without knowing their movement pattern, it's hard to predict. However, the main priority is to collect apples without dying.\n\nAnother thing to consider: moving up to (8,6) leaves me with the ability to move up again next turn. If the enemy is moving towards me, maybe I need to adjust. But since movement is simultaneous, if I move up and the enemy moves right or up, perhaps they might collide. But again, without knowing their direction, it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,5) could be safer if the enemy is approaching from the right. But the enemy's current head is at (6,3), which is two left and one up from my current position. If the enemy moves right, they could come towards me. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, the enemy's last move is not given. The last move information is for my snake, which was UP. The enemy's movement isn't provided. So we have to assume they might move in any direction. So the safest move is to collect the apple at (8,8) by moving up, but need to make sure that in the next steps, there's a path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (9,5) could be part of a plan to go towards other apples. But (9,5) is on the edge. If I move right, next turn I could move up or left. But (8,8) is still a target.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving up, my body would be at (8,5), but since I collected an apple, I grow. Wait, no. Wait, when you move into an apple, you grow by one segment. So after moving up to (8,5), which has an apple, I collect it, so my snake's length increases by 1. The current body is [(8,4)], so after moving up, the new body would be the previous head (8,5) and the previous body (8,4). Wait, no. The snake's body is ordered head to tail. So when you move, the head moves in the chosen direction, and each body segment follows the previous one. Since the snake has a head at (8,5) and body [(8,4)], moving up would make the new head (8,6), and the body would be [(8,5)]. Because each segment follows the previous. So if I move up, the new position is head (8,6), body [(8,5)]. But since I collected an apple at (8,5) when I moved there, does that trigger growth? Wait, the apple is at (8,5), which was the head's new position. So when the head moves into (8,5), that's where the apple is. So yes, moving up would collect the apple, and the snake would grow by one segment. So the new body would be [(8,5), (8,4)]? Wait, no. Wait, the body is ordered head to tail. So when you move, the new head is (8,6), and the body is the previous head (8,5), and the rest. But since the previous body was only [ (8,4) ], then after moving up, the body would be [ (8,5) ]? Because the head moves to (8,6), and the body follows. So the new body is the previous head. So after moving up, the snake's body would be [ (8,5) ].\n\nBut since we collected an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So the new body would be [ (8,5), (8,4) ]? Or does the growth happen after moving? Let me check the rules. The rules say: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So when the head moves into the apple's position, you collect it, and then you grow. So after moving into (8,5), which has an apple, you gain 1 point, and your snake grows by 1 segment. So the new snake would have a head at (8,5) (but wait, no, because the movement is to (8,5), so the new head is (8,5) after moving up from (8,4)? Wait, no. Wait, the previous head was (8,4) (from the initial position), and the last move was UP, which moved to (8,5). Now, the current head is (8,5). So in this turn, the head is at (8,5), and the body is [(8,4)]. So moving up would take the head to (8,6), and the body would follow. But since we collect the apple at (8,5) when we moved there last turn, but in this current turn, moving up from (8,5) to (8,6) would not collect an apple unless (8,6) has an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,7), (6,0), (2,7), (8,8), (2,0). So (8,5) had an apple, which was collected in the previous move. So in this current turn, the head is at (8,5), and the apple there is already collected. So moving up to (8,6) is empty. Therefore, moving up now would not collect an apple, but moving up would allow me to get closer to (8,8), which is three steps up.\n\nSo, the next move options:\n\nUP: (8,6) - no apple, but closer to (8,8)\nLEFT: (7,5) - no apple\nRIGHT: (9,5) - no apple\n\nSo the best option is to move UP towards (8,8). But I need to check if that's safe. The enemy is at (6,3). If the enemy moves in a direction that could lead them to collide with me. For example, if the enemy moves right and up, but since they can only move one step per turn, they can't reach (8,6) in one move. So (8,6) is safe. Also, since I have no body except (8,4), moving up would not hit my own body.\n\nTherefore, moving up is the best choice here. It's safe and brings me closer to the next apple. So the move should be UP.\nUP",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) in this turn. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the current state. My snake's head is at (5,8), with the body at (6,8) and (7,8). So it's a horizontal line going down from (5,8) to (7,8). The apples collected so far are 2, and there are more apples on the board: (0,7), (2,7), (2,0), (0,3), (2,8). Wait, (2,8) is an apple. The enemy snake is at (4,0) with a body at (5,0). \n\nThe last move was LEFT. So the previous head position was (6,8) moving left to (5,8) now. Wait, no. Wait, the current head is (5,8), so the last move must have been LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8). That seems correct. \n\nNow, considering the possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety.\n\nStarting with the current head position (5,8). Let's check each direction:\n\n1. UP: (5,8) -> (5,9). The board's y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). So (5,9) is valid. Need to check if this cell is occupied by any snake's body or another head after movement. \n\n   - My body parts are at (6,8) and (7,8). But after moving up, the new head is (5,9). The new body would be (5,8) (the previous head), (6,8), (7,8). So no collision with my own body. \n\n   - Check enemy snake: their head is (4,0), body (5,0). They might move, but since we don't know their direction yet, but since they move simultaneously, their new positions could affect us. However, in this turn, their direction isn't known. But for collision detection, we need to consider their possible moves. Wait, but according to the rules, when checking for collisions, we have to see if any snake's head moves into any part of another snake's body (including their own) after the movement. But since all snakes move at the same time, we have to check all possible positions they could move into. However, since we don't know the enemy's next move, perhaps we can only check based on the current positions. Wait, no. The rules say that if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies. But if our head moves into their body, we die. But since we don't know their direction, maybe we can't predict their movement. However, the rules state that during collision checks, all snakes move simultaneously. So when considering our move, we have to consider that the enemy snakes will also move. But since their movement is chosen by their own logic, which we don't know, this complicates things. \n\n   However, for the purpose of our decision, we can only consider the current state and possible collisions based on the current positions and the possible directions we can take. Wait, but the collision rules are based on the move we choose. So for each possible move we make, we have to check if after moving, our head is in a position that is occupied by any snake's body (including ours) after all snakes have moved. But since we don't know the enemy's next moves, perhaps we can't account for their possible directions. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\n   Wait, the rules say that when a snake moves, if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies. But for our move, we need to check if our head's new position would collide with any other snake's body (including ours) after all snakes have moved. However, since we don't know the enemy's movement, perhaps we can only check based on their current positions. Or maybe we assume that the enemies will move in a way that could cause a collision. But that's not possible. \n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the collision check for our move is based on the assumption that the enemy snakes will move in their current direction (but we don't know their direction). Wait, no. The problem states that all snakes choose their direction each turn. So for each turn, all snakes decide their direction, and then all move simultaneously. So when we choose our direction, we have to consider that the enemies could choose any direction, which might lead to collisions. But since we can't predict their choices, perhaps we can only check for collisions based on our own movement and the current positions of others. \n\n   This is a bit ambiguous. However, according to the problem's decision process step 2, eliminate any move that would immediately kill you. So for each possible move, we need to check if our head would end up in a position that is:\n\n   - Off the board: for example, moving LEFT from (5,8) would be (4,8), which is valid. But moving LEFT again would be (4,8) to (3,8), etc. \n\n   - Into your own body (including backwards). For example, if we move LEFT again, our new head is (4,8), and the body would be (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So (4,8) is not part of the body, so that's safe. \n\n   - Into another snake's body. For example, the enemy snake's body is at (5,0). If our head moves to (5,8), that's not conflicting. But if we move down to (5,7), that's not conflicting. \n\n   So for each possible direction, check if the new head position is:\n\n   - On the board (0-9 in x and y)\n   - Not in our own body (after moving)\n   - Not in any other snake's body (after they move)\n\n   But since we don't know the other snakes' directions, perhaps we can only check based on their current positions. Wait, but the rules say that when you move, all snakes move. So if another snake moves into a position where their head is in our body, they die. But for our own survival, we need to check if our head's new position is in any other snake's new position. However, since we don't know their directions, we can't predict that. \n\n   So perhaps the safest approach is to check for collisions based on the current positions of other snakes. Because if we move into a position that is currently occupied by another snake's body, then that would be a collision. But if they move away, then it's safe. But according to the rules, the collision is based on the new positions after all movements. So for example, if another snake is at (5,0), and they move up to (5,1), and our head moves to (5,8), there's no collision. But if they stay at (5,0), then no collision. However, if we move into a position that is occupied by another snake's body in their new position, that would be a collision. \n\n   Since we can't know their direction, perhaps the only way to avoid collision is to ensure that our new head position is not occupied by any other snake's body in their current position. But that's not sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps we should assume that the enemy snakes might move into positions that could cause a collision. But that's not possible to know. \n\n   This is a bit of a problem. The rules state that if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. So during our move, after all snakes have moved, if our head is in any snake's body (including their own), we die. \n\n   But since we don't know the other snakes' directions, perhaps we can't check for all possible collisions. However, the problem's decision process step 2 says to eliminate any move that would immediately kill you. So we have to check for collisions that would occur regardless of the enemy's moves. \n\n   Wait, no. Because the enemy's movement is also chosen in the same turn. So for example, if I move up, and an enemy moves into my new head position, that would kill me. But since we don't know their direction, we can't predict that. Therefore, perhaps the only collisions we can check for are those that are certain, i.e., based on current positions. \n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the decision process step 2 is to check for collisions that would happen regardless of the enemy's movement. For example, if we move into a position that is already occupied by another snake's body (current position), then even if they move away, but if they don't, then we would collide. But since they could move away, maybe that's not a certain collision. \n\n   This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the rules. \n\n   The rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So the movement is simultaneous. So when all snakes choose their direction, they all move. If after moving, my head is in any snake's body (including their own), I die. \n\n   So to check for a collision, we need to consider all possible combinations of enemy movements. But since we can't predict their directions, perhaps the only way to avoid collision is to make sure that our new head position is not in any other snake's possible new position. But that's impossible to know. \n\n   Therefore, perhaps the only collisions we can check for are those that are certain. For example, if our new head position is in another snake's current body position, and that snake does not move away, then we would collide. But since they might move, it's not certain. However, the problem's step 2 says to eliminate any move that would immediately kill you. So perhaps we need to check for moves that would definitely kill us, regardless of the enemy's moves. \n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the collision is considered if our new head position is in any other snake's new position. Since we don't know their directions, we can't know. Therefore, perhaps the only way to avoid certain death is to check if our new head position is in any other snake's current position. But that's not sufficient. \n\n   This is a bit of a dilemma. However, given the problem's decision process, step 2 says to eliminate any move that would immediately kill you. So perhaps we need to check for moves that would result in our head being in a position that is occupied by any other snake's body (current position) or if moving in that direction would cause a collision with our own body. \n\n   For example, if I move LEFT to (4,8), then check if (4,8) is in my own body (after moving) or in any other snake's body (current position). \n\n   My own body after moving would be (5,8) (previous head), (6,8), (7,8). So (4,8) is not in my body. \n\n   The enemy's current body is (5,0). So (4,8) is not in their body. So moving LEFT is safe in terms of current positions. \n\n   But if the enemy snake moves in a direction that brings their head or body to (4,8), then we would collide. But since we can't predict that, perhaps we can't consider that as a certain death. \n\n   Therefore, perhaps the only collisions we can check for are those that are certain. For example, if moving in a direction would cause our head to be in our own body (like moving back into the cell we just left, which is the previous head position). \n\n   For example, if I move LEFT from (5,8) to (4,8), then my new body is (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So the previous head (5,8) is now part of the body. But if I move LEFT again, then the new head is (4,8), and the body is (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So no collision with my own body. \n\n   However, if I move RIGHT, the new head is (6,8). But my body is at (6,8) and (7,8). So moving RIGHT would put my head at (6,8), which is part of my own body. That's a collision. So that direction is invalid. \n\n   So for each direction, check if the new head position is in my own body (after moving) or any other snake's body (current position). \n\n   So let's check each direction:\n\n   Current head: (5,8)\n\n   Possible moves:\n\n   UP: (5,9). Not in my body (new body would be (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)). Not in enemy's body (they are at (4,0) and (5,0)). So safe.\n\n   DOWN: (5,7). Check if (5,7) is in my body (new body would be (5,8), (6,8), (7,8))? No. Check enemy's body: (5,0) is not (5,7). So safe.\n\n   LEFT: (4,8). Not in my body. Not in enemy's body. Safe.\n\n   RIGHT: (6,8). But my body after moving would be (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So (6,8) is part of the body. So moving RIGHT would cause my head to be in my own body. That's a collision. So RIGHT is invalid. \n\n   So RIGHT is eliminated. \n\n   So possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. \n\n   Now, step 2 eliminates RIGHT. \n\n   Next, step 3: among the safe moves, prefer those that increase chance of eating apples and keep future options open. \n\n   Let's look at the apples. The apples are at (0,7), (2,7), (2,0), (0,3), (2,8). \n\n   Our current head is at (5,8). The apple at (2,8) is at (2,8). That's 3 units to the left. So if we move LEFT three times, we could reach that apple. But each move is one step. \n\n   The other apples are further away. For example, (0,7) is 5 left and 1 up. (2,7) is 3 left and 1 down. \n\n   So moving LEFT towards (2,8) could be a good option. \n\n   Let's see. If we move LEFT to (4,8), then next turn we could move LEFT again to (3,8), then to (2,8), which is an apple. That would allow us to collect it. \n\n   Alternatively, moving UP to (5,9) might not be helpful. The apple at (0,7) is at (0,7), which is 5 left and 2 down from (5,9). \n\n   Down to (5,7) is closer to (2,7) (3 left and 0 down). \n\n   So perhaps moving LEFT is the best option to approach (2,8). \n\n   Also, considering future moves. After moving LEFT, we have more options. For example, from (4,8), we can go LEFT again, or UP/DOWN. \n\n   Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The new head position is (4,8). The body would be (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So no collision. \n\n   Now, check if (4,8) is in any other snake's body. The enemy's body is at (5,0). So no. \n\n   So LEFT is a safe move. \n\n   Now, considering the enemy snake. Their head is at (4,0), body (5,0). If they move in any direction, their new position could be (4,1) (UP), (4,-1) (DOWN, which is invalid), (3,0) (LEFT), or (5,0) (RIGHT). But since they can't move DOWN (y=0 is the bottom, so moving down would go to y=-1 which is invalid. So possible directions for enemy are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n   If they move LEFT to (3,0), then their body would be (4,0) (previous head) and (5,0). So their new head is (3,0), body (4,0), (5,0). \n\n   If our head is at (4,8) after moving LEFT, then there's no collision. \n\n   However, if the enemy moves in a direction that brings their head or body into (4,8), that would kill us. But since they are at (4,0), even if they move up, they can't reach (4,8) in one move. \n\n   So moving LEFT seems safe. \n\n   Another thing to consider is that moving LEFT brings us closer to the apple at (2,8). So that's a good move. \n\n   Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) would bring us closer to (2,7) which is an apple. That's 3 left and 0 down. But moving LEFT three times would reach (2,8). \n\n   So which is better? \n\n   Let's think about the apple at (2,8). It's directly left of our current position. If we move LEFT three times, we can get it. But each move is one step. However, we need to make sure that each step is safe. \n\n   For example, after moving LEFT once to (4,8), then again to (3,8), then to (2,8). \n\n   But in each step, we need to check for collisions. \n\n   Let's check if moving LEFT is possible. \n\n   So the first move LEFT is safe. \n\n   So the immediate move is LEFT. Then, in future turns, we can continue LEFT towards (2,8). \n\n   Therefore, the best move now is LEFT. \n\n   Another thing to check: the apple at (2,8) is at (2,8). So moving LEFT three times would reach it. But each move must be safe. \n\n   Also, after moving LEFT, our body is (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). So the next move LEFT would be (4,8) as head, body (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). Then next LEFT to (3,8), body (4,8), (5,8), (6,8). Then next LEFT to (2,8), which is an apple. \n\n   So that's a possible path. \n\n   Now, check if any of these steps would collide. \n\n   For the first move LEFT to (4,8): safe. \n\n   Second move LEFT to (3,8): new head (3,8). Body (4,8), (5,8), (6,8). \n\n   Third move LEFT to (2,8): head (2,8), body (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8). \n\n   So each step is safe. \n\n   However, during each move, we need to check for collisions with other snakes. \n\n   For example, when moving to (4,8), the enemy's head is at (4,0). If they move up, they could be at (4,1), but that's not conflicting. \n\n   So moving LEFT seems safe. \n\n   Another consideration: the enemy's head is at (4,0). If they move in any direction, their new positions are (4,1), (3,0), (5,0). \n\n   Our head is at (5,8) now, moving LEFT to (4,8). \n\n   So no collision between our new head and enemy's body. \n\n   So LEFT is a good move. \n\n   Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) would take us closer to (2,7) apple. \n\n   But (2,7) is 3 left and 0 down from (5,7). So moving LEFT three times from (5,7) would reach (2,7). \n\n   But moving DOWN now would require that in the next steps, we can move LEFT. \n\n   However, moving DOWN now might be a good option. \n\n   Let's compare the two options: LEFT vs DOWN. \n\n   Moving LEFT brings us closer to (2,8) which is an apple. \n\n   Moving DOWN brings us closer to (2,7) which is another apple. \n\n   Which is better? \n\n   The apples are equally valuable. However, (2,8) is directly left, so moving LEFT is more direct. \n\n   Also, after moving LEFT, we can continue in that direction. \n\n   Also, moving DOWN might not be as direct. \n\n   So I think LEFT is better. \n\n   Another thing: the apple at (2,8) is in the same row as our current head (5,8) but 3 to the left. So moving LEFT three times would get it. \n\n   So the best move now is LEFT. \n\n   Therefore, the answer should be LEFT.\nLEFT",
