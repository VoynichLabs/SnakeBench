That would mean you just ate the apple at (6, 3)\u2014but looking at the board, the apple at (6, 3) isn't listed, but the apple at (6, 3) isn't present; there's an apple at (6, 3)? Actually, per the board, the apple at (6, 3) is not listed, but there's an apple at (4, 3).\n\nLet's cross-reference:\n\n- Apples are at (2, 5), (2, 7), (9, 6), (3, 5), (4, 3)\n- Our snake's head: (6, 3)\n  \nThe apple at (4, 3) is to the left and down. Our current head at (6, 3) is two units to the right of (4, 3). \n\nOur last move was DOWN, so starting at (6, 3), moving DOWN to (6, 2), which is an empty space, not an apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last move was UP? The last move info states:\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nSo, last move was DOWN, meaning moving from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\n\nNow, considering our next move decision: we want to reach the closest apple efficiently and safely.\n\n- The closest apples to us are at:\n  - (4,3): 2 units left, same y.\n  - (2,5): further away.\n  - (2,7): further away.\n  - (9,6): to the right, slightly above.\n  - (3,5): further left and slightly up.\n\nOur current position is (6, 3). The apple at (4, 3) is directly to the left at (4, 3), two steps away horizontally. To get there, moving LEFT twice would get us there, but we need to check if the path is safe:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3): is it safe? There's no obstacle reported at (5, 3).\n- Moving further left to (4, 3): likely safe and directly on the apple.\n\nAlternative paths could be approaching from above (like towards (6, 5)), but that seems less direct.\n\nIs moving LEFT now safe? Let's verify:\n\n- Positions to avoid include:\n  - Walls: (x<0 or x>9), (y<0 or y>9)\n  - Self: our snake is length 2 and in positions (6, 3) and (6, 4), so moving into (5, 3) or (7, 3) doesn't collide unless occupied.\n  - Enemy snake at (0,8): far away.\n\nSince the position at (5, 3) appears empty, and moving LEFT is safe, it seems like a good idea to move LEFT.\n\nIn terms of strategy:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3), then further LEFT to (4, 3) would result in eating an apple at (4, 3), strengthening the snake.\n\nTherefore, **next move: LEFT**.\n\nI'll decide to go LEFT now to get closer to the apple at (4, 3), which is directly to our left, as it's the most accessible. After that, we can plan to move further left to consume the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

The apple at (4, 3) is directly to the left at (4, 3), two steps away horizontally. To get there, moving LEFT twice would get us there, but we need to check if the path is safe:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3): is it safe? There's no obstacle reported at (5, 3).\n- Moving further left to (4, 3): likely safe and directly on the apple.\n\nAlternative paths could be approaching from above (like towards (6, 5)), but that seems less direct.\n\nIs moving LEFT now safe? Let's verify:\n\n- Positions to avoid include:\n  - Walls: (x<0 or x>9), (y<0 or y>9)\n  - Self: our snake is length 2 and in positions (6, 3) and (6, 4), so moving into (5, 3) or (7, 3) doesn't collide unless occupied.\n  - Enemy snake at (0,8): far away.\n\nSince the position at (5, 3) appears empty, and moving LEFT is safe, it seems like a good idea to move LEFT.\n\nIn terms of strategy:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3), then further LEFT to (4, 3) would result in eating an apple at (4, 3), strengthening the snake.\n\nTherefore, **next move: LEFT**.\n\nI'll decide to go LEFT now to get closer to the apple at (4, 3), which is directly to our left, as it's the most accessible. After that, we can plan to move further left to consume the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

The apple at (4, 3) is directly to the left at (4, 3), two steps away horizontally. To get there, moving LEFT twice would get us there, but we need to check if the path is safe:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3): is it safe? There's no obstacle reported at (5, 3).\n- Moving further left to (4, 3): likely safe and directly on the apple.\n\nAlternative paths could be approaching from above (like towards (6, 5)), but that seems less direct.\n\nIs moving LEFT now safe? Let's verify:\n\n- Positions to avoid include:\n  - Walls: (x<0 or x>9), (y<0 or y>9)\n  - Self: our snake is length 2 and in positions (6, 3) and (6, 4), so moving into (5, 3) or (7, 3) doesn't collide unless occupied.\n  - Enemy snake at (0,8): far away.\n\nSince the position at (5, 3) appears empty, and moving LEFT is safe, it seems like a good idea to move LEFT.\n\nIn terms of strategy:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3), then further LEFT to (4, 3) would result in eating an apple at (4, 3), strengthening the snake.\n\nTherefore, **next move: LEFT**.\n\nI'll decide to go LEFT now to get closer to the apple at (4, 3), which is directly to our left, as it's the most accessible. After that, we can plan to move further left to consume the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

So, our snake is vertical, with the head just below its body.\n- The nearby apple is at (6, 3), which is exactly where our head is currently located.\n- Since moving onto an apple causes growth and points, and our current head is at (6, 3), moving down to (6, 2) would be the next logical step if we wanted to go towards the apple at (6, 3). But wait, our head is already at (6, 3), which suggests immediate consumption.

But the last move info says the last move was DOWN, which aligns with moving from (6, 3) to (6, 2). That would mean you just ate the apple at (6, 3)\u2014but looking at the board, the apple at (6, 3) isn't listed, but the apple at (6, 3) isn't present; there's an apple at (6, 3)? Actually, per the board, the apple at (6, 3) is not listed, but there's an apple at (4, 3).\n\nLet's cross-reference:\n\n- Apples are at (2, 5), (2, 7), (9, 6), (3, 5), (4, 3)\n- Our snake's head: (6, 3)\n  \nThe apple at (4, 3) is to the left and down. Our current head at (6, 3) is two units to the right of (4, 3). \n\nOur last move was DOWN, so starting at (6, 3), moving DOWN to (6, 2), which is an empty space, not an apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last move was UP? The last move info states:\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nSo, last move was DOWN, meaning moving from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\n\nNow, considering our next move decision: we want to reach the closest apple efficiently and safely.\n\n- The closest apples to us are at:\n  - (4,3): 2 units left, same y.\n  - (2,5): further away.\n  - (2,7): further away.\n  - (9,6): to the right, slightly above.\n  - (3,5): further left and slightly up.\n\nOur current position is (6, 3). The apple at (4, 3) is directly to the left at (4, 3), two steps away horizontally. To get there, moving LEFT twice would get us there, but we need to check if the path is safe:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3): is it safe? There's no obstacle reported at (5, 3).\n- Moving further left to (4, 3): likely safe and directly on the apple.\n\nAlternative paths could be approaching from above (like towards (6, 5)), but that seems less direct.\n\nIs moving LEFT now safe? Let's verify:\n\n- Positions to avoid include:\n  - Walls: (x<0 or x>9), (y<0 or y>9)\n  - Self: our snake is length 2 and in positions (6, 3) and (6, 4), so moving into (5, 3) or (7, 3) doesn't collide unless occupied.\n  - Enemy snake at (0,8): far away.\n\nSince the position at (5, 3) appears empty, and moving LEFT is safe, it seems like a good idea to move LEFT.\n\nIn terms of strategy:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3), then further LEFT to (4, 3) would result in eating an apple at (4, 3), strengthening the snake.\n\nTherefore, **next move: LEFT**.\n\nI'll decide to go LEFT now to get closer to the apple at (4, 3), which is directly to our left, as it's the most accessible.

The closest apple directly accessible is at (4, 3), but it's not stated among the apples\u2014it's a target I identified earlier, but wait, the apples are at (2, 5), (2, 7), (9, 6), (3, 5), and (1, 8). Our current row is 3, and the apples are mostly above or to the sides.  \n- The closest apple aligned with our current position is at (3, 5) or (2, 5), which are above and to the left, but the snake's current position is at (6, 3).  \n- Moving left (decreasing x) from (6, 3) to (5, 3) seems safe; that keeps us on the same row, moving towards the left.  \n- However, the apple at (3, 5) is two columns left and two rows above our current position, so moving directly left won't directly help unless I aim for a more direct route.\n\nGiven the current position, moving left to (5, 3) seems safe, but it's not near an immediate apple. Alternatively, moving right to (7, 3) would put us away from apples, and moving up or down should be considered.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n- Moving right to (7, 3): no snake body there; safe.  \n- Moving up to (6, 4): is part of our body; moving up would cause collision with ourselves.  \n- Moving down to (6, 2): free, but not directly toward an apple.\n\nFurthermore, the apple at (2, 5) is quite far from our current position at (6, 3). \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (0, 6).

So, our snake is vertical, with the head just below its body.\n- The nearby apple is at (6, 3), which is exactly where our head is currently located.\n- Since moving onto an apple causes growth and points, and our current head is at (6, 3), moving down to (6, 2) would be the next logical step if we wanted to go towards the apple at (6, 3). But wait, our head is already at (6, 3), which suggests immediate consumption. So, perhaps the last move already resulted in us eating an apple at (6, 3).\n\nGiven that, let me check the last move: you moved DOWN, which would have taken your head from (6, 3) to (6, 2). But the last move info says the last move was DOWN, which aligns with moving from (6, 3) to (6, 2). That would mean you just ate the apple at (6, 3)\u2014but looking at the board, the apple at (6, 3) isn't listed, but the apple at (6, 3) isn't present; there's an apple at (6, 3)? Actually, per the board, the apple at (6, 3) is not listed, but there's an apple at (4, 3).\n\nLet's cross-reference:\n\n- Apples are at (2, 5), (2, 7), (9, 6), (3, 5), (4, 3)\n- Our snake's head: (6, 3)\n  \nThe apple at (4, 3) is to the left and down. Our current head at (6, 3) is two units to the right of (4, 3). \n\nOur last move was DOWN, so starting at (6, 3), moving DOWN to (6, 2), which is an empty space, not an apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last move was UP? The last move info states:\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nSo, last move was DOWN, meaning moving from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\n\nNow, considering our next move decision: we want to reach the closest apple efficiently and safely.\n\n- The closest apples to us are at:\n  - (4,3): 2 units left, same y.\n  - (2,5): further away.\n  - (2,7): further away.\n  - (9,6): to the right, slightly above.\n  - (3,5): further left and slightly up.\n\nOur current position is (6, 3). The apple at (4, 3) is directly to the left at (4, 3), two steps away horizontally. To get there, moving LEFT twice would get us there, but we need to check if the path is safe:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3): is it safe? There's no obstacle reported at (5, 3).\n- Moving further left to (4, 3): likely safe and directly on the apple.\n\nAlternative paths could be approaching from above (like towards (6, 5)), but that seems less direct.\n\nIs moving LEFT now safe? Let's verify:\n\n- Positions to avoid include:\n  - Walls: (x<0 or x>9), (y<0 or y>9)\n  - Self: our snake is length 2 and in positions (6, 3) and (6, 4), so moving into (5, 3) or (7, 3) doesn't collide unless occupied.\n  - Enemy snake at (0,8): far away.\n\nSince the position at (5, 3) appears empty, and moving LEFT is safe, it seems like a good idea to move LEFT.\n\nIn terms of strategy:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 3), then further LEFT to (4, 3) would result in eating an apple at (4, 3), strengthening the snake.\n\nTherefore, **next move: LEFT**.\n\nI'll decide to go LEFT now to get closer to the apple at (4, 3), which is directly to our left, as it's the most accessible. After that, we can plan to move further left to consume the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",

The closest apple directly accessible is at (4, 3), but it's not stated among the apples\u2014it's a target I identified earlier, but wait, the apples are at (2, 5), (2, 7), (9, 6), (3, 5), and (1, 8). Our current row is 3, and the apples are mostly above or to the sides.  \n- The closest apple aligned with our current position is at (3, 5) or (2, 5), which are above and to the left, but the snake's current position is at (6, 3).  \n- Moving left (decreasing x) from (6, 3) to (5, 3) seems safe; that keeps us on the same row, moving towards the left.  \n- However, the apple at (3, 5) is two columns left and two rows above our current position, so moving directly left won't directly help unless I aim for a more direct route.\n\nGiven the current position, moving left to (5, 3) seems safe, but it's not near an immediate apple. Alternatively, moving right to (7, 3) would put us away from apples, and moving up or down should be considered.\n\nChecking for obstacles:\n- Moving right to (7, 3): no snake body there; safe.  \n- Moving up to (6, 4): is part of our body; moving up would cause collision with ourselves.  \n- Moving down to (6, 2): free, but not directly toward an apple.\n\nFurthermore, the apple at (2, 5) is quite far from our current position at (6, 3). \n\nThe enemy snake's head is at (0, 6). To avoid collision, moving left or right should be safe for now. Since the current position is at (6, 3), moving left to (5, 3) seems safe and could help us start heading toward the apples on the left side. \n\nConsidering our goal: to eat apples for points and avoid collision, I think moving left makes sense, as moving left from (6, 3) to (5, 3) avoids immediate hazards and positions us to pick up apples at (2, 5) or (2, 7) with some planning.\n\nNext turn's strategy:\n- Proceed to the left to start moving toward apples on the left side.  \n- Possibly follow a path going upwards after that to reach the apples at (2, 5) or (2, 7).\n\n**Decision:** I will move LEFT this turn.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**",
