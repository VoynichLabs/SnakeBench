There are two apples to the right (3, 2 and 6, 4), one apple below (6, 1), and one apple above (0, 6).\n\nTo maximize points, I should aim for the apples that are not surrounded by my body or other snakes. The apple at (0, 6) is not a good choice because it's too close to my current position, and moving towards it would put me at risk of colliding with myself.\n\nThe apple at (6, 1) is also not a good choice because it's too close to Snake #2, and moving towards it would put me at risk of colliding with it.\n\nThe apples at (3, 2) and (6, 4) are both good choices because they are not surrounded by my body or other snakes. However, moving towards the apple at (3, 2) would require moving left, which is not an option for me at the moment.\n\nTherefore, I will aim for the apple at (6, 4).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating the apple at (6, 4), I should move towards the apple at (3, 2) if possible, or towards the apple at (0, 6) if necessary, but only if it's safe to do so.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

A . . . 2 . . . .\n   8 . . . . . . . . . .\n   7 . . . . . . . . . .\n   6 A . . . . . . . . .\n   5 . . 1 . . . . . . .\n   4 . . . . . . A . . .\n   3 . . . . . . . . . .\n   2 . . . A . . . . . .\n   1 . . . . . . A . . .\n   0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   ```\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Up**: Moving up from (5, 9) would take the snake to (4, 9). This is safe and there are no apples or enemies in this direction.\n- **Down**: Moving down from (5, 9) would take the snake to (6, 9). There is an apple at (6, 1), but moving down would not get you there directly. Also, there is no immediate threat from Snake #1.\n- **Left**: Moving left from (5, 9) would take the snake to (5, 8). This is safe and there are no apples or enemies in this direction.\n- **Right**: Moving right from (5, 9) would take the snake to (5, 10). This is out of bounds and would result in the snake dying.\n\n### Strategy:\nGiven the current position and the layout, the best move would be to move up to (4, 9) to avoid immediate threats and to stay in a safe position. This move also keeps the snake in a position where it can potentially move towards apples in the future.\n\n### Decision:\nThe next move is UP.\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP.\n\n**UP**"
