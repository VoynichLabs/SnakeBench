Eating it immediately gains 1 apple and lengthens me by 1.\n- Enemy head is at (2,6). They cannot reach (5,7) this turn, so there's no risk of a head-on collision on the apple.\n- Taking the apple keeps my options open: after UP I can continue toward nearby apple clusters or retreat if the enemy approaches from the left. Growing early is beneficial for late-game control.\n\nShort plan for next few turns:\n- After eating (5,7), prefer to stay in open space and head toward reachable apples while avoiding getting boxed against the left wall where the enemy is concentrated. If the enemy moves aggressively right, steer downward toward the dense apples around x=5 (5,4; 5,3) or circle to control central area.\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT also avoids moving toward the enemy snake at (5,6), which would risk a head-on collision on this turn. The enemy snake could move any direction, but if it moves LEFT to (4,6) or UP to (5,7), I will not be in its path. I will avoid moving into tight spaces and plan to collect apples while staying alive.\n\n**Potential moves:**\n- UP to (2,7): Empty, but moves closer to the enemy and could risk a head-on collision if the enemy moves DOWN to (5,5) (unlikely) or UP to (5,7) (possible). However, UP also approaches the apple at (5,7) but reduces options for next turn (only LEFT or RIGHT if I don't want to go back).\n- DOWN to (2,5): Empty, but moves away from most apples and could trap me later.\n- LEFT to (1,6): Empty, but moves left into a region with apples but also near the border; could be safe but I prefer RIGHT for more flexibility.\n- RIGHT to (3,6): Empty, safe, and keeps multiple options open. This is the best choice among safe moves.\n\nGiven the above, I choose RIGHT.\n\n**My move:**  \nRIGHT",

LEFT also moves toward the enemy and a more crowded apple area.\n- UP is safe and can reach the apple at (4,8) next turn, but it keeps me nearer to the enemy (x=5 vs enemy x=3).\n- RIGHT increases horizontal separation from the enemy (x becomes 6 vs their x=3), keeps multiple follow-up options, and points me toward the nearby apples at (7,7) and (8,7). It keeps escape routes open and reduces the chance of a head-on collision.\n- So RIGHT is the best balance of safety, options, and apple pursuit.\n\nShort plan for next few turns:\n- Move RIGHT now to (6,7). If safe, continue to (7,7) to pick that apple and then (8,7) if contested. If the enemy shifts aggressively right, fall back toward the central apples cluster (5,4 / 5,3 / 4,3) and use extra length to control space.\n- Always avoid moving back toward the enemy unless I can secure apples or trap them.\n\nRIGHT",

This suggests that survival and growth are key.\nMy Snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (3, 6)\n- Body: None (I am size 1).\n- Apples: 0.\n- Last Move: RIGHT (from 2,6 to 3,6).\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (5, 7)\n- Body: [(5, 6)]\n- Apples: 1 (Score: 1).\n- *Critical Observation:* The enemy snake has a body segment at (5, 6).\n- *Critical Observation:* The enemy snake has an apple at (5, 7)? Wait, looking at the board map in the prompt:\n  - Row 7 (y=7): `. . . . . 1 . A A .`\n  - The '1' is at index 5 (x=5), so Head is (5, 7).\n  - The 'A' (apple) is at index 6 (x=6) and 7 (x=7). So (6, 7) and (7, 7) are apples.\n  - *Wait*, let me check the \"Apples at\" list provided at the top: `(5, 0), (8, 4), (1, 4), (5, 3), (1, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (0, 2), (4, 8), (3, 4), (5, 4), (7, 7), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3)`.\n  - Is (5, 7) an apple? No. The list contains (8,7), (7,7) but NOT (5,7).\n  - *Correction*: I initially misread the map or the apple list. Let's verify the map row 7 again.\n    - Map row 7: `. . . . . 1 . A A .`\n    - Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    - Index 6 is empty (`.`).\n    - Index 7 is `A`.\n    - Index 8 is `A`.\n    - So there are apples at (6,7) and (7,7)? No, index 6 is empty on the map. Wait, looking closer at the map text provided:\n      ` 7 . . . . . 1 . A A .`\n      Spaces can be tricky. Let's count the dots.\n      0:.\n      1:.\n      2:.\n      3:.\n      4:.\n      5:1\n      6:.\n      7:A\n      8:A\n      9:.\n    - So apples are at (7,7) and (8,7)? No, (8,7) is 'A' at index 8? Wait, the apple list says (8,7) is an apple. The map shows an 'A' at index 8.\n    - Actually, the map row 7 text is: `. . . . . 1 . A A .`\n    - Let's look at the text more carefully. `. . . . . 1 . A A .`\n    - Counting the characters separated by spaces:\n      0: `.`\n      1: `.`\n      2: `.`\n      3: `.`\n      4: `.`\n      5: `1`\n      6: `.`\n      7: `A`\n      8: `A`\n      9: `.`\n    - So there is an apple at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n    - Wait, the apple list provided: `(5, 0), (8, 4), (1, 4), (5, 3), (1, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (0, 2), (4, 8), (3, 4), (5, 4), (7, 7), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3)`.\n    - (7, 7) is in the list. (8, 7) is in the list.\n    - The map shows 'A' at x=7 and x=8 for y=7. This matches.\n    - *However*, the map text provided in the prompt says: ` 7 . . . . . 1 . A A .`\n    - Let's verify the apple at (5,7). The map shows '1' at x=5, y=7. That is the enemy head. There is no apple at (5,7) listed in the text or the map (the map shows '.' or '1' there).\n    - My previous thought \"Enemy snake has an apple at (5,7)\" was incorrect. The enemy head is at (5,7). The apples are at (6,7) and (7,7)? No, map shows (7,7) and (8,7) as apples based on the dots.\n    - Wait, looking at the map string provided in the prompt again:\n      ` 7 . . . . . 1 . A A .`\n      Let's parse this character by character ignoring the prompt's potential formatting errors.\n      Position 0: .\n      Position 1: .\n      Position 2: .\n      Position 3: .\n      Position 4: .\n      Position 5: 1\n      Position 6: .\n      Position 7: A\n      Position 8: A\n      Position 9: .\n      So (7,7) is an Apple. (8,7) is an Apple.\n    - Wait, the apple list says (8,7) is an apple. And (7,7) is an apple.\n    - Where is the apple at (6,7)? It's not there. The map shows '.' at (6,7).\n    - So the enemy head at (5,7) is adjacent to apples at (7,7) and (8,7) but blocked by (6,7) being empty?\n    - No, the distance is important.\n    - My head is at (3,6).\n    - Enemy head is at (5,7). Enemy body is at (5,6).\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n1.  **Enemy Snake (Snake 1):**\n    -   Head: (5, 7)\n    -   Body: (5, 6)\n    -   Distance to me: My head (3,6) is 2 units away (Manhattan distance: |3-5| + |6-7| = 2+1=3? No, just x-distance is 2).\n    -   The enemy is at x=5, y=7. I am at x=3, y=6.\n    -   The cell (4, 6) is empty. (5, 6) is the enemy body.\n    -   The cell (4, 7) is empty. (5, 7) is enemy head.\n    -   The enemy can move DOWN to (5,6) -> **CRASH** into own body.\n    -   The enemy can move LEFT to (4,7).\n    -   The enemy can move RIGHT to (6,7).\n    -   The enemy can move UP to (5,8).\n    -   **Crucial**: (5,6) is the enemy's body. If the enemy moves DOWN, it dies. It is likely the enemy will not move DOWN.\n    -   If the enemy moves LEFT to (4,7), it gets closer to me.\n    -   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,7), it heads towards apples at (7,7) and (8,7).\n\n2.  **My Options (Head at 3,6):**\n    -   **UP (3,7):**\n        -   Current map: Row 7 at x=3 is `. . . . .` -> index 3 is `.`. Empty.\n        -   If I go UP to (3,7), I am closer to the enemy at (5,7).\n        -   If the enemy moves LEFT (to 4,7), we are neighbors.\n        -   If the enemy moves DOWN (to 5,6), it dies. I survive.\n        -   Risk of head-on collision? Only if Enemy moves to (3,7). Enemy is at (5,7), so max x-distance is 2. They can't reach (3,7) in one move (max move is 1).\n        -   So UP is safe from immediate collision.\n        -   Is it safe from traps? (3,7) is near the top wall (y=9 is top). I have options Left, Right, Down, Up (to 8).\n        -   (3,7) is adjacent to (2,7) (empty), (4,7) (empty), (3,6) (my tail moves away), (3,8) (empty).\n        -   Seems okay.\n    -   **DOWN (3,5):**\n        -   Map row 5: `. . . . . . . . . .` -> (3,5) is empty.\n        -   Moves away from the enemy.\n        -   Apples nearby: (3,4) is an apple. (5,4) is an apple.\n        -   (3,5) is safe.\n    -   **LEFT (2,6):**\n        -   Map row 6: `. A . 0 . T . . A .`\n        -   Index 2 is `.`. Empty.\n        -   (2,6) is empty. (I moved from here last turn).\n        -   Moving away from enemy.\n        -   (2,6) is adjacent to (1,6) which is an apple? No, looking at map row 6: `. A . 0 ...` index 1 is `A`. Yes, (1,6) is an apple.\n        -   However, (1,6) is adjacent to (0,6) which is empty. (1,5) is empty. (1,7) is empty? Map row 7: index 1 is `.`. Yes.\n        -   Moving LEFT allows me to eat (1,6) next turn.\n        -   Risk: The enemy snake is at (5,7). It cannot reach me immediately.\n    -   **RIGHT (4,6):**\n        -   Map row 6: `. A . 0 . T . . A .`\n        -   Index 4 is `.`. Empty.\n        -   (4,6) is empty.\n        -   (5,6) is the enemy body. (5,7) is enemy head.\n        -   If I go RIGHT to (4,6), I am 1 unit away from the enemy body (5,6).\n        -   If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,5), I am safe.\n        -   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,7), I am safe.\n        -   If the enemy moves UP to (5,8), I am safe.\n        -   If the enemy moves LEFT to (4,7), we are neighbors.\n        -   Is (4,6) safe? Yes.\n        -   Is it risky? The enemy is very close. If the enemy decides to move DOWN (which would kill it, so it won't), or if it moves LEFT (to 4,7), we are adjacent.\n        -   Being adjacent to an enemy is dangerous because if I move into their path next turn, I die. But here, the enemy is close.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **RIGHT (4,6):** Puts me closer to the enemy. The enemy is at (5,7). Distance is 2.\n-   **UP (3,7):** Puts me closer to the enemy. Distance is 2 (|3-5| + |7-7| = 2).\n-   **LEFT (2,6):** Moves away from enemy. Distance increases to 3. Leads to an apple at (1,6).\n-   **DOWN (3,5):** Moves away from enemy. Distance increases to 3. Leads to apples at (3,4) and (5,4).\n\n**Decision:**\nI am currently at (3,6). My last move was RIGHT to get here. I wanted flexibility.\nNow I need to choose the *best* safe move.\n\n-   Moving **RIGHT** to (4,6) or **UP** to (3,7) brings me into immediate proximity with the enemy.\n    -   The enemy has 1 apple and is likely aggressive.\n    -   However, the enemy is at (5,7). Its body is at (5,6).\n    -   If I am at (4,6) and the enemy is at (5,7), the enemy cannot move DOWN (into its own body). It can move LEFT to (4,7).\n    -   If I am at (3,7) and the enemy is at (5,7), the enemy can move LEFT to (4,7).\n    -   Being near the enemy is risky. If the enemy moves aggressively, we might get into a \"standoff\" or I might be cut off.\n\n-   Moving **LEFT** to (2,6) seems like a solid choice.\n    -   It moves me toward the apple at (1,6).\n    -   It moves me away from the enemy (distance increases).\n    -   (2,6) is empty. (1,6) is an apple.\n    -   From (2,6), I can go to (1,6) next turn to eat.\n    -   From (1,6), I am safe from the enemy at (5,7).\n\n-   Moving **DOWN** to (3,5) is also solid.\n    -   It moves me toward apples at (3,4) and (5,4).\n    -   It moves me away from the enemy.\n    -   (3,5) is empty.\n\n**Why LEFT over DOWN?**\nLooking at the apples:\nApples at (1,6) is very close (1 step away if I move LEFT now, then next step I am there).\nApples at (3,4) and (5,4) are further (2 steps away).\n(1,6) is an immediate target.\nAlso, the map at row 6 shows a clear path to the left.\nRow 6: `. A . 0 . T . . A .`\nMy body is currently just the head. I have no tail to worry about hitting (except if I move backwards, which I won't).\nBy moving LEFT, I am essentially claiming the left side of the board. The enemy is on the right side (x=5).\nThe enemy is at (5,7). If I go LEFT, I go to (2,6). The enemy likely won't chase me all the way to the left immediately because there are apples in the center and right (e.g., (7,7), (8,7), (8,6)).\nAlso, moving to (2,6) avoids the tight space near the top right corner where the enemy is. The enemy is near the top (y=7). If I go UP to (3,7), I also get near the top.\nGoing LEFT or DOWN seems safer.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate (2,6) vs (3,5).**\n(2,6) -> Apple at (1,6). (1,6) is safe? Map row 6: index 1 is 'A'. Row 5, index 1 is '.' (empty). Row 7, index 1 is '.' (empty).\nSo (1,6) is safe to approach.\n(3,5) -> Apple at (3,4). (3,4) is an apple. (3,3) is 'A' (from map row 3: `A A . . A A...` wait, map row 3: `A A . . A A...` index 3 is '.'? No, index 3 is '.'? Let's check map row 3 text: ` 3 A A . . A A . . . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:A...\nSo (3,3) is empty. (3,4) is apple.\n(3,4) is surrounded by apples at (4,3) and (5,4). This might be a cluster.\nHowever, the enemy is at (5,7). It can easily move down to (5,6) (wait, body is at 5,6, so it can't).\nIt can move to (5,5), (6,7), (4,7), (5,8).\nIf the enemy moves to (6,7) or (4,7), it is moving away from the center (3,4).\nIf the enemy moves to (5,8), it is moving up.\nIf the enemy moves to (5,5), it is moving down towards the center.\nSo the enemy might head towards the center.\nIf I go to (3,5), I am in the center.\nIf I go to (2,6), I am on the left flank.\n\nThe enemy has 1 apple. I have 0.\nIf I grab (1,6), I get 1 point.\nThe enemy might try to grab (7,7) or (8,7) or (8,6).\nThe distance from enemy (5,7) to (7,7) is 2. To (8,7) is 3.\nDistance from me (3,6) to (1,6) is 2.\nWe are racing for different apples.\n\n**Safety Check for (2,6):**\nMove LEFT from (3,6) to (2,6).\nIs (2,6) occupied? No.\nWill I hit myself? No (body is empty).\nWill I hit the enemy? Enemy is at (5,7), body at (5,6). (2,6) is far.\nWill the enemy hit me? No.\nIs there a risk of being trapped at (2,6)?\nFrom (2,6), neighbors are (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7).\n(1,6) will be an apple (and I will eat it).\n(3,6) was my previous position (will be empty by the time I arrive).\n(2,5) is empty (Row 5: ...).\n(2,7) is empty (Row 7: ...).\nSo (2,6) is a very safe move with 3 open neighbors (plus the one I came from).\n\n**Safety Check for (3,5):**\nMove DOWN from (3,6) to (3,5).\nIs (3,5) occupied? No.\nNeighbors: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n(3,4) is an apple.\n(2,5) is empty.\n(4,5) is empty.\nAlso safe.\n\n**Why (2,6) is better:**\n1.  **Distance from Enemy:** Moving to (2,6) maximizes distance from the enemy at (5,7).\n    -   Current distance: 3 (Manhattan: |3-5| + |6-7| = 3).\n    -   New distance (2,6): |2-5| + |6-7| = 3+1 = 4.\n    -   New distance (3,5): |3-5| + |5-7| = 2+2 = 4.\n    -   Distance is equal. But positionally, (2,6) is closer to the left edge, which is usually safer if the enemy is on the right.\n2.  **Apple Target:** (1,6) is a specific apple. It is \"\u5b64\u7acb\" (isolated) on the left side. Grabbing it doesn't put me immediately in a cluster where the enemy can easily follow or cut me off.\n3.  **Enemy Behavior:** The enemy is at (5,7). The most valuable apples for the enemy are likely (7,7) and (8,7). If the enemy goes for those, it will move RIGHT. This is good for me. If the enemy goes for (5,4), it has to move down.\n    -   If I am at (2,6), I am far from (5,4).\n    -   If I am at (3,5), I am competing for (5,4) (distance 2 for me vs 3 for enemy).\n    -   Actually, if I go to (3,5), I am close to the center apples.\n    -   Let's reconsider the apples.\n    -   Apples: (1,6) is a free grab.\n    -   Apples: (3,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) form a cluster in the center-left.\n    -   Apples: (7,7), (8,7) are on the right.\n    -   Apples: (8,6), (8,4) are far right.\n    -   The enemy is at (5,7). It is in the top-right quadrant.\n    -   If I move LEFT to (2,6), I am securing the left flank.\n    -   If I move DOWN to (3,5), I am entering the central cluster.\n    -   The enemy has a body at (5,6). This blocks the direct path from (5,7) to (5,5). The enemy cannot go straight down. It must go LEFT to (4,7) or RIGHT to (6,7) or UP to (5,8) to maneuver.\n    -   This blockage gives me time. The enemy is slightly restricted.\n    -   If I go to (3,5), I am closer to the enemy's potential path if it decides to invade the center.\n    -   If I go to (2,6), I am outside the immediate invasion route.\n    -   Also, consider the board edges. (2,6) is x=2. (3,5) is x=3. Both are safe from walls.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (2,6).\nThis is a safe move, moves me towards an apple (1,6), and keeps me away from the enemy snake's immediate area.\nI will not move into the center yet, as the enemy is closer to the center than I am (vertically).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove to (2,6). Then next turn, move LEFT to (1,6) to eat the apple. After eating, assess the enemy's position. If the enemy moved right towards (7,7), I can continue left or pivot to the center. If the enemy moved down, I might stay on the left or move down cautiously.\n\nDouble check coordinates.\nMy head (3,6).\nMap row 6: `. A . 0 . T . . A .`\nIndices:\n0: `.`\n1: `A` (Apple at 1,6)\n2: `.` (Target 2,6)\n3: `0` (Me)\n4: `.` (Empty)\n5: `T` (My tail? No, wait. The map says `T` at index 5. My body is empty. Why is there a T?)\nWait, looking at the map provided:\n` 6 . A . 0 . T . . A .`\nThis is confusing. \"T\" usually denotes Tail. But the state says \"Body: none\".\nIs \"T\" a typo? Or is it actually an 'A'? Or is it empty?\nLet's look at the text again: ` 6 . A . 0 . T . . A .`\nIf \"T\" is there, is it an obstacle?\nUsually in these text maps, '.' is empty, 'A' is apple, numbers are snake heads, letters/chars are body parts.\nThe prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head... and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nMy state: \"Head: (3, 6), Body: none\".\nIf body is none, then the cell behind my head (3,5) should be empty, and the cell behind that should be empty.\nWhy is there a 'T' at (5,6)?\nWait, let's look at the enemy snake.\nEnemy: \"Head: (5, 7), Body: [(5, 6)]\".\nSo (5, 6) is the enemy's body.\nThe map shows `T` at index 5 of row 6? No, row 6 index 5 is `.`? Let's count the spaces in the map string provided in the prompt.\n` 6 . A . 0 . T . . A .`\nLet's split by space:\n`6`, `.`, `A`, `.`, `0`, `.`, `T`, `.`, `.`, `A`, `.`\nWait, that's 11 items (including the row number 6).\nIndices:\n0: `.` (x=0)\n1: `A` (x=1)\n2: `.` (x=2)\n3: `0` (x=3) - My head\n4: `.` (x=4)\n5: `T` (x=5) - This is the enemy body? No, enemy body is at (5,6).\nWait, map row 6: ` . A . 0 . T . . A .`\nColumn 5 is `T`.\nColumn 5 corresponds to x=5.\nMy coordinates: (3,6) is head.\nEnemy body is at (5,6).\nSo the map shows `T` at (5,6).\nThis confirms the enemy body is there. `T` might stand for \"Target\" or just a generic body character in this specific map rendering (or typo for the enemy color/symbol).\nRegardless, (5,6) is occupied by the enemy body.\nSo (4,6) is empty (index 4).\n(3,6) is me (index 3).\n(2,6) is empty (index 2).\nSo moving LEFT to (2,6) is safe.\n\nWhat about the `T` at (5,6)? It is the enemy body. The enemy is at (5,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, it hits its own body at (5,6). It dies.\nSo the enemy will NOT move DOWN.\nThis is a crucial constraint for the enemy.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is safe.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nI have no body. So I can't hit myself.\nI just need to avoid the enemy.\n\nLet's consider if I should move UP or LEFT.\n(2,6) is empty.\n(3,7) is empty.\n(3,7) is closer to the enemy.\nIf I move to (3,7), I am at y=7. Enemy is at y=7.\nWe are on the same row.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (4,7), we are neighbors.\nIf I am at (2,6), I am at y=6. Enemy is at y=7.\nWe are not on the same row.\nThis makes me safer from a sudden dash.\nAlso, from (2,6), I can move to (1,6) to eat.\nFrom (3,7), I can move to (4,7) or (2,7) or (3,8).\n(1,6) is an apple. (4,7) is empty.\nEating an apple early is good for growth and score.\nThe enemy has 1 apple. I have 0. I need to catch up.\nTherefore, moving LEFT to secure (1,6) is a high-priority objective.\n\nIs (1,6) safe to eat next turn?\n(1,6) is an apple.\nNeighbors of (1,6): (0,6), (2,6), (1,5), (1,7).\n(0,6): Map row 6 index 0 is `.`. Empty.\n(2,6): Will be empty (my previous pos).\n(1,5): Map row 5 index 1 is `.`. Empty.\n(1,7): Map row 7 index 1 is `.`. Empty.\nSo (1,6) is safe to eat.\nThe enemy is at (5,7). It cannot reach (1,6) in 1 turn. It cannot reach (2,6) in 1 turn.\nSo I am safe.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any reason to NOT move LEFT?\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (2,6).\nIf the enemy moves somehow to (2,7)? No, enemy is at (5,7). Max move is 1. Distance is 3. Impossible.\nIf the enemy moves to (4,7)? We are safe.\nIf the enemy moves to (6,7)? We are safe.\nIf the enemy moves to (5,8)? We are safe.\nIf the enemy moves to (5,5)? We are safe.\n\nOkay, LEFT is the best move.\n\nFinal check on the prompt instructions:\n- \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\n  - My body: None.\n  - Enemy body: (5,6).\n- \"Ultrathink and consider your moves carefully.\"\n  - I have analyzed 4 directions. Left is best for safety and apple acquisition.\n- \"Be constantly aware of the enemy snake\"\n  - Enemy is at (5,7). It cannot reach me this turn. It cannot hit me.\n- \"Do not mention future directions after it.\"\n  - I will output \"LEFT\" on the final line.\n\nOne slight worry: The enemy might move LEFT to (4,7). If it does that, on the next turn I will be at (2,6) and it will be at (4,7). I will still be safe. I can eat (1,6). It can try to chase me or go for other apples.\nIf I were at (3,7) and it moved to (4,7), we would be right next to each other. That's dangerous.\nSo moving LEFT is indeed the better choice to maintain distance.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"outwit him and outlast him\".\nOutlasting requires not dying. Not dying requires keeping distance when possible.\nOutwitting requires grabbing resources efficiently.\n(1,6) is an efficient grab.\n\nLet's review the apples again.\nApples at: (5, 0), (8, 4), (1, 4), (5, 3), (1, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (0, 2), (4, 8), (3, 4), (5, 4), (7, 7), (0, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3)\nMy target: (1, 6).\n\nIs there any trap?\nThe board is open.\nMy last move was RIGHT (to 3,6).\nIf I move LEFT now, I return to (2,6).\nIs moving back and forth bad? No, because I am moving towards an apple (1,6) that I didn't have access to directly from (2,6) previously? Wait, I was at (2,6) on turn 0.\nTurn 0: Head was (2,6). I moved RIGHT to (3,6).\nWhy did I move RIGHT on turn 0?\nMy previous rationale (provided in the prompt) said: \"Moving RIGHT keeps my immediate options open... avoids moving toward the enemy snake at (5,6)\".\nThat was correct for turn 0.\nNow on turn 1, the situation has shifted slightly (I am at 3,6, enemy is at 5,7).\nThe apple at (1,6) is now a valid target.\nActually, I could have moved LEFT on turn 0 to (1,6)? No, I was at (2,6) on turn 0. (1,6) was empty? Yes.\nBut I chose RIGHT.\nNow I am at (3,6). (1,6) is still empty.\nIt is not \"moving back\". It is moving towards a target.\n(2,6) is just a waypoint.\nSo LEFT is correct.\n\nDouble check the coordinate system.\n\"decreasing your x coordinate is to the left\"\n\"increasing your y coordinate is up\"\n(3,6) -> (2,6) is decreasing x. This is LEFT.\n\nThe final line must be exactly one word: LEFT.\n\nLet's write the responseLEFT",

The enemy snake is at (5, 7) with a body segment at (5, 6).\nMy last move was RIGHT (from 2,6 to 3,6).\nI need to decide between UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6), and RIGHT (4,6).\n\nAnalysis of moves:\n1.  **RIGHT (4,6)**: This is empty. However, it places me at (4,6), which is adjacent to the enemy head (5,7) and the enemy body (5,6). This brings me into immediate proximity of the enemy, increasing risk of head-on collision or being trapped. The enemy is close and likely to move towards apples or safety. Moving into the danger zone is not optimal for \"outlasting\".\n2.  **UP (3,7)**: This is empty. (3,7) is adjacent to the enemy head at (5,7) (distance 2). It is also adjacent to the top wall at y=9. While empty, it is closer to the enemy than necessary. If the enemy moves left, we get dangerously close.\n3.  **DOWN (3,5)**: This is empty. Moves away from the enemy. Good safety move.\n4.  **LEFT (2,6)**: This is empty. Moves away from the enemy. (2,6) is the position I was at on the previous turn (Turn 0). While moving \"back\" might seem inefficient, the board state has changed slightly. The main factor is safety and the path to apples.\n    -   The apple at (1,6) is highly attractive. It is just one step away from (2,6).\n    -   Moving LEFT to (2,6) sets up a guaranteed apple eat on the following turn (Turn 3) by moving to (1,6).\n    -   Moving LEFT maximizes distance from the enemy (Distance to enemy head is |2-5| + |6-7| = 4, versus |3-5| + |5-7| = 4 or |4-5| + |6-7| = 2). Wait, let's recalculate distances to the *current* enemy position (5,7).\n        -   At (3,6): Dist = |3-5| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n        -   At (2,6): Dist = |2-5| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n        -   At (4,6): Dist = |4-5| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n        -   At (3,5): Dist = |3-5| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n        -   At (3,7): Dist = |3-5| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n    -   LEFT and DOWN provide the best separation (distance 4) from the current enemy position. LEFT leads to an apple. DOWN leads to an open area but no immediate apple (nearest are (3,4) and (5,4), two steps away).\n    -   Choosing LEFT secures the apple at (1,6) in the next turn. This is a clear objective. The area (1,6) is safe: (1,5) is empty, (1,7) is empty, (0,6) is empty. (2,6) is empty (my tail will move from (3,6) to (2,6) next turn? No, my tail is currently at (2,6) because I have length 1. Wait, I am size 1. My body is \"none\" in the description, but technically my tail is where my head was.\n        -   My current head: (3,6). Tail: effectively (2,6) (from last turn).\n        -   If I move LEFT to (2,6):\n            -   New Head: (2,6).\n            -   New Tail: (3,6) moves away? No, I am size 1. When I move, the cell I leave becomes empty (unless I eat).\n            -   Wait, the prompt says \"Body: none\". This usually implies length 1. In Snake games, length 1 has no \"body\" following, only the head. The \"tail\" is effectively non-existent or the same as the head for collision purposes?\n            -   Actually, the prompt says \"Body: none\". This means I have length 1. I do not have a body segment.\n            -   If I move from (3,6) to (2,6), I leave (3,6) empty. I do not leave a tail because I am length 1? No, usually you have a tail if you have moved. The prompt \"Body: none\" might mean I haven't eaten an apple yet.\n            -   Let's look at the prompt: \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 6), Body: none, Apples collected: 0\".\n            -   If I eat an apple, I grow.\n            -   If I don't eat, I move. My body follows.\n            -   Since I have no body listed, maybe I am literally just a head? Or the body list is empty because it's length 1?\n            -   In standard snake logic, \"Body\" usually lists the segments *excluding* the head. \"Head\" is the first element. If \"Body\" is empty, it means the snake is length 1.\n            -   If I am length 1, moving leaves my previous position empty. I do not collide with myself.\n            -   So moving to (2,6) is safe because I came from there, but I am leaving it. My previous head was at (2,6). If I am length 1, I am not currently occupying (2,6).\n            -   Wait, check the board map: `Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\n            -   The map shows '0' at index 3 (x=3, y=6).\n            -   The map shows 'T' at index 2 (x=2, y=6).\n            -   'T' usually stands for Tail.\n            -   So I am length 2? But the text description says \"Body: none\".\n            -   This is a conflict. The map is the source of truth for board state. The map shows a Tail at (2,6).\n            -   So I am length 2.\n            -   If I am length 2, my body is [(2,6)]. My head is (3,6).\n            -   If I move LEFT to (2,6), I will be moving into my own body segment.\n            -   **CRITICAL REALIZATION**: Moving LEFT is suicide.\n            -   The prompt says \"Body: none\" in the text description, but the ASCII map shows 'T' at (2,6).\n            -   I must trust the map visualization provided in the prompt. The map is the explicit state.\n            -   If the map shows a Tail at (2,6), then I cannot move there.\n\nLet's re-read the map.\n`Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nIndices 0-9.\n0: .\n1: A\n2: 0 (Wait, is this 0 or T?)\nLet's look closely at the prompt's map string:\n` 6 . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nWait, let's count the characters in the provided string ` 6 . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nSpaces are separators?\n`0: .`\n`1: A`\n`2: 0`\n`3: .`\n`4: .`\n`5: .`\n`6: T`\n`7: .`\n`8: .`\n`9: A`\n\nWait, let's look at the text again.\n` 6 . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nIf indices are separated by spaces:\nIndex 0: `.`\nIndex 1: `A`\nIndex 2: `0` (This is the head!)\nIndex 3: `.`\nIndex 4: `.`\nIndex 5: `.`\nIndex 6: `T` (This is the tail?)\nIndex 7: `.`\nIndex 8: `.`\nIndex 9: `A`\n\nWait, if the head is at (3,6) as stated in the text description (\"Head: (3, 6)\"), then index 3 should be the head.\nBut the text description at the start of the turn says: \"Head: (2, 6)\".\nWait, let's check the text provided at the very top of the prompt.\n`Turn: 2 / 150`\n`Your snake (ID: 0):`\n`  - Head: (2, 6)`\n`  - Body: none`\n`  - Apples collected: 0`\n\nWait, I am confused. The \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section says `LEFT`.\nThe \"START LAST RATIONALE\" section says `Head: (3, 6)`.\nThere is a discrepancy between the very first block (Turn 2 state) and the \"Last Rationale\" block (Turn 1 state).\n\nLet's look at the map provided in the Turn 2 state:\n`Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nLet's map this to coordinates x=0..9, y=6.\nx=0: .\nx=1: A\nx=2: 0\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: T\nx=7: .\nx=8: .\nx=9: A\n\nIf the head is at (2,6) (as per the Turn 2 state description), then this map is consistent: Head '0' is at x=2.\nIf the head is at (3,6) (as per the Turn 1 rationale), then the map is inconsistent (or I am misreading the map).\n\nLet's re-read the Turn 2 state block carefully.\n`Your snake (ID: 0):`\n`  - Head: (2, 6)`\n`  - Body: none`\n`  - Apples collected: 0`\n\nIf Head is (2,6) and Body is none (length 1), then the 'T' at x=6, y=6 must be something else? Or the map is generic?\nActually, the map key is usually:\n. = empty\nA = Apple\n0 = Snake 0 Head\n1 = Snake 1 Head\nT = Snake 0 Tail (or generic tail)\n\nIf I am length 1 (Head: (2,6), Body: none), then I do not have a tail. The 'T' on the map might be an artifact of the map generator if it expects tails, or it represents the enemy body? No, enemy is '1' and 'T' usually means \"my tail\".\n\nLet's trust the text description: `Head: (2, 6)`, `Body: none`.\nThis implies length 1.\nIf I am length 1, I can move anywhere that isn't a wall, apple (wait, apples are good), enemy body, or my own body (I have no body).\nSo, I can move LEFT to (1,6)? No, (1,6) is an Apple (A).\nI can move LEFT to (1,6) to eat the apple.\nWait, the map shows `A` at x=1, y=6.\nSo moving LEFT is a valid move to eat an apple.\n\nBUT, the \"Last Move\" info says:\n`**START LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`LEFT`\n`**END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n\nAnd the Rationale says:\n`My Head: (3, 6)`\n`Last Move: RIGHT (from 2,6 to 3,6).`\n\nThis implies I am at (3,6) currently (Turn 2 start).\nWhy does the `Your snake (ID: 0)` block say `Head: (2, 6)`?\nThis is contradictory.\n\nLet's assume the **map** and the **Head: (2,6)** text are the current state for Turn 2.\nIf `Head: (2, 6)` is correct, then I am at (2,6).\nThe map shows `0` at x=2, y=6.\nThis matches.\nThe rationale provided in the prompt (which describes the *previous* turn's analysis) claimed I moved to (3,6). But the current state says I am at (2,6).\nThis means the rationale provided *by the user* (the block starting with `START LAST RATIONALE`) is from the perspective of Turn 1, describing the move to (3,6) as hypothetical or expected?\nNo, the prompt says: `--Your last move information:--`\n`**START LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`LEFT`\n`**END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n\nWait. The user input shows `START LAST MOVE PICK` `LEFT`.\nBut the Rationale text says `Last Move: RIGHT`.\nThis is a mess of conflicting information.\n1. Current Turn 2 state: `Head: (2,6)`. Map: `0` at (2,6).\n2. Last Move (Turn 1 action): The user prompt shows `LEFT`. But the rationale text (written *by me* in the previous turn, I assume, or provided as context) says I moved `RIGHT` to (3,6).\n\nLet's look at the `START LAST RATIONALE` block.\nIt says: `Last Move: RIGHT (from 2,6 to 3,6).`\nIt also says: `Turn: 2 / 150` (at the top of the prompt).\nWait, the prompt starts with `Turn: 2 / 150`.\nThen `START LAST MOVE PICK` shows `LEFT`.\nThis implies the user is providing the move they *actually* made in the previous turn, which was LEFT.\nBut the Rationale text *inside* the prompt claims the move was RIGHT.\n\nThis is a conflict between the \"Last Move\" metadata and the \"Last Rationale\" text.\nThe \"Last Move\" metadata (`LEFT`) is likely the ground truth of what happened in Turn 1.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" text is likely a text dump from the previous turn's output, or a sample, or I (the model) am supposed to ignore the specific history and just look at the current state.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Ground Truth):**\n- Turn: 2.\n- My Snake: Head (2, 6), Body: none.\n- Map: `Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\n  - `0` is at x=2, y=6. This confirms Head is (2,6).\n  - `T` is at x=6, y=6. This is confusing if Body is none. It might be a misplaced symbol or the map is displaying a tail from a previous state that hasn't cleared? Or it's the enemy tail? No, enemy is `1`.\n  - Enemy: Head (6,7), Body [(5,7)].\n  - Map Enemy: Row 7: `1` at x=6? No, map row 7: `. . . . . T 1 A A .`\n    - Let's parse map row 7 carefully.\n    - ` 7 . . . . . T 1 A A .`\n    - x=0: .\n    - x=1: .\n    - x=2: .\n    - x=3: .\n    - x=4: .\n    - x=5: T\n    - x=6: 1\n    - x=7: A\n    - x=8: A\n    - x=9: .\n    - Wait, the text description says Enemy Head is (6,7) and Body is [(5,7)].\n    - The map shows `1` at x=6, y=7. Matches Head.\n    - The map shows `T` at x=5, y=7. This likely represents the enemy body segment (5,7). The map key uses `T` for tails/other snake bodies usually? Or just a display artifact.\n    - Regardless, (5,7) is occupied by the enemy body. (6,7) is occupied by enemy head.\n\n**Decision for Turn 2:**\nI am at (2, 6). Head (2,6). Body: none (Length 1).\nAvailable moves:\n- UP (2, 7): Map row 7 at x=2 is `.`. Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN (2, 5): Map row 5 at x=2 is `.`. Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (1, 6): Map row 6 at x=1 is `A`. Apple. Safe. Growth.\n- RIGHT (3, 6): Map row 6 at x=3 is `.`. Empty. Safe.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **LEFT (1, 6)**: Eats an apple. Increases length to 2. Safe (empty or apple). This is highly advantageous.\n- **RIGHT (3, 6)**: Moves to empty space. Safe.\n- **UP (2, 7)**: Moves towards the enemy (Head at 6,7, Body at 5,7). (2,7) is far from them. Safe.\n- **DOWN (2, 5)**: Moves away from enemy. Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince I am at (2,6) and (1,6) is an apple, I should take the apple.\nIs it safe?\nCheck collision with enemy.\nEnemy Head is at (6,7). Enemy Body is at (5,7).\nI am moving to (1,6).\nDistance is large. No collision risk.\nIs there any reason *not* to eat the apple?\nIf I don't eat, I stay small. Eating grows me. This is almost always better, especially early on, unless the apple is a trap leading to a dead end.\n(1,6) is at the left edge.\nIf I eat at (1,6), I will be at (1,6) with body [(2,6)].\nNext turn, my options from (1,6) are:\n- UP (1,7): Empty (map row 7, x=1 is `.`).\n- DOWN (1,5): Empty (map row 5, x=1 is `.`).\n- LEFT (0,6): Empty (map row 6, x=0 is `.`).\n- RIGHT (2,6): This is my current tail position. It will be empty after I move? No, if I eat, I grow. My tail stays at (2,6) effectively?\n  - If I eat at (1,6):\n    - New Head: (1,6).\n    - Old Head (2,6) becomes body segment.\n    - Tail stays at (2,6) because I grew.\n    - Wait, I am currently length 1. Tail is effectively \"none\" or the previous head.\n    - If I eat, I become length 2.\n    - My body will be [(2,6)].\n    - Next turn, moving RIGHT to (2,6) would be moving into my own body.\n    - So from (1,6), I cannot move RIGHT immediately (if I eat now).\n    - But I can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n    - (0,6) is empty.\n    - (1,7) is empty.\n    - (1,5) is empty.\n    - So the area around (1,6) is open.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT to (1,6) is the optimal move. It secures an apple, grows my snake, and is safe from immediate collision. It also positions me towards the left side of the board, potentially isolating me from the enemy who is on the right side (x=5,6).\n\nOne check: The map shows `T` at (6,6) (Row 6, Index 6).\nWait, let's look at the map again.\n`Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nIndex 6 is `T`.\nWhere is the enemy body? The text says Enemy Body is [(5,7)].\nThe map row 7 shows `T` at index 5.\nThe map row 6 shows `T` at index 6.\nThis `T` might be a display artifact for \"Empty\" or \"Snake segment\" that isn't the head?\nOr is it possible the enemy body extends to (6,6)?\nIf the enemy body is at (6,6), then moving UP to (2,7) or RIGHT to (3,6) or LEFT to (1,6) is not affected.\nBut if the enemy body is at (6,6), and I am at (2,6), we are far apart.\nThe immediate threat is low.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is the best local objective.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am currently at (2, 6). The apple at (1, 6) is immediately accessible. Moving LEFT consumes the apple, increasing my length and score. The area around (1, 6) is open (UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6) are all empty), so I will not be trapped after eating. The enemy snake is currently located on the right side of the board at (6, 7) and (5, 7), far away from my target. Engaging with the enemy is risky and unnecessary this early; securing resources and maintaining distance is the priority. Moving RIGHT, UP, or DOWN would leave the apple available for potential competition or delay my growth without offering a clear strategic advantage over the safe apple capture at (1, 6).\n\nThe final move will be LEFT.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 6), Body: none\".\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (1,6).\nThe map shows (1,6) is 'A'.\nThis is correct.\n\nDouble check the board bounds.\n(1,6) is within 0-9.\nSafe.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Move\" vs \"Current State\".\nIf the \"Last Rationale\" (which claimed I was at 3,6) was actually describing the *previous* turn's state and I should ignore the specific numbers in it because the *Current State* block overrides it, then I am definitely at (2,6).\nThe `START LAST MOVE PICK` `LEFT` in the user prompt might refer to the move *I* (the AI) should pick *now*? Or it's the history?\nUsually \"Last Move Information\" is history.\nGiven the conflict, I trust the `Turn: 2` header and the `Head: (2, 6)` block as the definitive CURRENT state.\nThe `START LAST RATIONALE` block is likely just noise or context from a previous generation that I should base my decision on the *current* board state provided.\n\nSo, I am at (2,6). (1,6) is an apple. I should eat it.\n\nWait, looking at the map again.\n`Row 6: . A 0 . . . T . . A .`\nIs the '0' at index 2?\nYes.\nIs the 'A' at index 1?\nYes.\nSo LEFT is the move.\n\nThe `T` at index 6 (x=6) is interesting. It might be the enemy tail, or a visual glitch.\nIf it's an enemy body segment at (6,6), the enemy is at (6,7) and (5,7) and (6,6).\nThis is still far from me at (2,6).\n\nDecision: Move LEFT.\n\nFinal line: LEFT.Current Situation Analysis:\n\nI am currently at **(2, 6)**. The apple at **(1, 6)** is immediately adjacent to my head. Moving **LEFT** allows me to consume this apple, increasing my length and score. This is a safe move, as the cells surrounding the target apple ((0,6), (1,5), (1,7)) are all empty according to the board state. The enemy snake is currently positioned on the right side of the board at (6,7) and (5,7), posing no immediate threat to my move on the left side. Securing resources early while maintaining distance from the opponent is the optimal strategy.\n\nI will move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

No, let's check the map again.\n        Map Row 7: `. A . . . T T 1 A .`\n        Wait, the map shows `T` at indices 5 and 6? Let's trace.\n        (0,7): .\n        (1,7): A\n        (2,7): .\n        (3,7): .\n        (4,7): .\n        (5,7): T (Body segment of Snake #1)\n        (6,7): T (Body segment of Snake #1)\n        (7,7): 1 (Head of Snake #1)\n        (8,7): A\n        (9,7): .\n\n        So, (2, 7) is **Empty**.\n        However, moving UP to (2, 7) places me directly North of the enemy's body segments at (2, 6) (wait, (2,6) is *my* tail if I move).\n        If I move UP, I go to (2, 7). This is safe for the immediate turn. But where will the enemy go?\n        The enemy is at (7, 7). They are blocked by walls to the East. They are likely to move West (to (6, 7)) or South (to (7, 6)). If they move West, they hit their own body. If they move South, they might be safe. If they move North, they hit the wall (9,9).\n        This move seems neutral but tightens space against the wall.\n\n    *   **DOWN (2, 5)**: Map Row 5: `. . . . . . . . . .` -> **Empty**.\n        This moves me away from the enemy. It is a safe, open space.\n\n    *   **LEFT (1, 6)**: Map Row 6: `. A 0 . . . T . . A .`\n        Index 1 is `A` (Apple).\n        My current head is at (2, 6) (Index 2).\n        Moving LEFT goes to (1, 6).\n        (1, 6) contains an Apple.\n        This is a valid move that eats an apple.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 6)**: Map Row 6, Index 3 is `.` (Empty).\n        This moves me away from the apple at (1,6) and towards the center of the board.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment**:\n    *   **Moving LEFT (1, 6)**:\n        *   **Immediate Benefit**: Eats an apple (+1 Score, +1 Length).\n        *   **Safety**: The destination is an apple. The cells surrounding it ((0,6), (1,5), (1,7)) are empty.\n        *   **Constraint**: The prompt states \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" If I move LEFT, my tail (at (3,6) if I was there last turn, or effectively (3,6) based on the map's `T` at index 6) moves forward. The cell I leave (2,6) becomes empty (unless I grow). Since I am eating an apple, I will grow, so my tail stays at (3,6). I will not collide with myself.\n        *   **Comparison**: Eating an apple is the primary objective to win. Since it is safe and immediately beneficial, it is the optimal choice compared to moving to empty space.\n\n    *   **Other Moves**:\n        *   UP, DOWN, RIGHT are empty spaces. While safe, they do not provide immediate score gain. LEFT provides score gain + safe transition.\n\n5.  **Long-term Strategy**:\n    *   The enemy is on the far right (x=7). I am on the left (x=2). I have plenty of space.\n    *   Eating the apple at (1,6) increases my length, which is advantageous for potential block maneuvers later.\n    *   After eating, I will likely want to move towards (0,6) or (1,5) to clear the space and look for the next apple, keeping distance from the enemy.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Move LEFT to (1, 6) is the best move. It is safe, eats an apple, and gains a point. The enemy is too far away to intercept this move, and the space is clear.\n\nDecision: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Additionally, the prompt's \"Important\" instructions and the \"last move rationale\" explicitly state that moving LEFT from (2, 6) led to (1, 6). This confirms that \"LEFT\" is the correct directional choice to maintain the intended trajectory if the head is indeed at (2, 6). If the head is at (0, 6), \"LEFT\" would be a wall, but the consistency of the \"LEFT\" command across the text strongly suggests it is the intended move to align with the game's internal logic or the map's visual representation.\n\nTherefore, I will select **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",
