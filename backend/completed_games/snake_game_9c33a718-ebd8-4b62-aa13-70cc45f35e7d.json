If it moves toward (4,1) or (3,2), it could threaten future paths.\n3. **Expand toward (2,9) or (5,5)**: After eating (7,8), choose the apple that offers the most growth opportunities (e.g., (2,9) is isolated and high-value).\n\n**Turn-by-Turn Strategy:**\n- **Turn 3**: After eating (7,8), move **UP to (7,8)** (from (8,7)). Now head is at (7,8), body is empty.\n  - Next move: **UP to (6,8)** or **LEFT to (6,7)** to avoid blocking future paths.\n- **Turn 4**: If enemy moves toward (3,2), consider moving **RIGHT to (8,8)** to avoid potential collisions.\n- **Turn 5**: If (2,9) is still available, move toward it (e.g., **UP to (6,9)** if possible).\n- **Turn 6-10**: Balance between eating (5,5) or (2,9) based on enemy movements. If enemy starts growing, prioritize (2,9) for isolation.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If enemy moves toward (4,6), avoid getting trapped near (5,5). Instead, prioritize (2,9) or (4,6) based on enemy\u2019s path.\n- Always leave at least 2 safe moves (e.g., don\u2019t corner yourself near the edge).\n\n---\n\n### **Current Turn Analysis (Turn 2)**\n- **Head at (8,7)** after moving **LEFT**.\n- **Apples**: (7,8) is now 1 move away (UP).\n- **Enemy**: No immediate threat, but could move toward (3,2) or (4,1).\n\n**Best Move**: **UP to (9,8)** is safe but doesn\u2019t help reach (7,8) quickly. **LEFT to (8,7)** was correct last turn to position for (7,8).\n**Now, to eat (7,8) on Turn 3**, the next move must be **UP to (7,8)** from (8,7). But wait\u2014this would require moving **UP** from (8,7) to (7,8), but the board shows (7,8) is an apple. However, the head is at (8,7), so moving **UP** would take it to (7,8), which is valid.\n\nBut the question is: **What\u2019s the best move now (Turn 2) to ensure we can eat (7,8) on Turn 3?**\n- If we move **UP to (9,8)**, we\u2019re not closer to (7,8).\n- If we move **LEFT to (8,7)**, we\u2019re already there (but we just moved LEFT last turn).\n- If we move **DOWN to (9,6)**, we\u2019re moving away from (7,8).\n\n**Correction**: The head is at (8,7) after moving **LEFT** from (9,7). To eat (7,8), we need to move **UP to (7,8)** on Turn 3. But on Turn 2, we\u2019re at (8,7), so the only move that keeps us positioned for (7,8) is **UP to (9,8)** (but that\u2019s not helpful) or **LEFT to (8,7)** (already there). Wait, no\u2014the head is at (8,7), so moving **UP** would take it to (7,7), not (7,8). Oops!\n\n**Re-evaluating**:\n- Head is at (8,7). Moving **UP** \u2192 (7,7).\n- Moving **DOWN** \u2192 (8,6).\n- Moving **LEFT** \u2192 (7,7).\n- Moving **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,7) (invalid, off-board).\n\n**No direct path to (7,8) from (8,7)**. The apple is at (7,8), so to reach it, we\u2019d need to move **UP** to (7,7) first, then **UP** to (7,8). But that\u2019s two moves, and the enemy could interfere.\n\n**Alternative Strategy**:\n- Since (7,8) is not reachable in one move from (8,7), the best immediate move is to **UP to (7,7)** to position for (7,8) next turn.\n- Then on Turn 3, move **UP to (7,8)** to eat it.\n\n**Enemy Consideration**:\n- Enemy at (3,1) could move toward (3,2) or (4,1). If it moves toward (4,1), it might threaten (4,6) later.\n\n**Final Decision**:\n**UP** to (7,7) to position for (7,8) on Turn 3.\n\n---\n**UP**",

It can move UP, LEFT, or DOWN. The enemy will likely move LEFT toward (2,9) since it's the closest apple to them (1 move). They might also move DOWN if they think I'm going for (2,9).\n\n**Available moves from (2,8):**\n- UP (2,9): Safe - no obstacles, gets me an apple\n- DOWN (2,7): **DEADLY** - moves into my own body\n- LEFT (1,8): Safe - no obstacles\n- RIGHT (3,8): Safe - no obstacles\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. The enemy is very close to the apple at (2,9) - only 1 move away\n2. I'm also 1 move away from (2,9) if I move UP\n3. If both of us move UP, we'd collide head-on and both die\n4. If I move UP to (2,9), I'll get the apple if the enemy moves LEFT or DOWN\n5. Moving RIGHT to (3,8) positions me closer to intercept the enemy's path to other apples\n6. Moving LEFT to (1,8) moves me away from the main apple cluster\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Moving UP to (2,9): Safe, gets me an apple if enemy doesn't move UP as well. If enemy moves UP, we collide and both die (bad outcome).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,8): Safe, positions me closer to the center of the board and keeps multiple options open\n- Moving LEFT to (1,8): Safe, but moves me away from the apple cluster\n\n**Decision:**\nI should move RIGHT to (3,8) because:\n1. Moving UP to (2,9) is risky - the enemy is very likely to move LEFT to (2,9) to get the apple, which would result in a head-on collision\n2. Moving RIGHT positions me closer to the center of the board\n3. This gives me better access to multiple apples (5,5), (3,4), (7,1), (8,1)\n4. Moving RIGHT keeps me in a good position to intercept the enemy's path to other apples\n5. This move maintains multiple safe follow-up options\n\n**Short-term strategy:**\n- Avoid head-on collision with enemy at (2,9)\n- Position myself closer to the center of the board for better access to remaining apples\n- Maintain multiple movement options for future turns\n\nRIGHT",

It can move UP, LEFT, or DOWN. From (2,9), it has body at (3,9), so it cannot move RIGHT either. This means the enemy can only move UP, LEFT, or DOWN.\n\nThe closest apple to the enemy is (3,4) at 6 moves. To get there, it would need to move DOWN or LEFT first. It might also move DOWN to position itself closer to (5,6) or (5,5).\n\n**Available moves from (3,8):**\n- UP (3,9): **DEADLY** - moves into enemy's body\n- DOWN (3,7): Safe - no obstacles\n- LEFT (2,8): **DEADLY** - moves into my own body\n- RIGHT (4,8): Safe - no obstacles\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. The enemy is blocked from moving RIGHT, so it's likely to move DOWN or LEFT\n2. Moving DOWN to (3,7) positions me closer to (3,4) and (5,6)\n3. Moving RIGHT to (4,8) moves me toward (5,5) and (5,6)\n4. (3,4) is the closest apple to me at 4 moves DOWN\n5. If the enemy moves DOWN, it might head toward (3,4) or try to cut me off\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Moving DOWN to (3,7): Safe, gets me closer to (3,4) which is the closest apple\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,8): Safe, positions me closer to (5,6) and (5,5)\n\n**Decision:**\nI should move DOWN to (3,7) because:\n1. (3,4) is the closest apple to me (4 moves)\n2. Moving DOWN gets me closer to it more directly\n3. This keeps me on the same column as (3,4), making it easier to reach\n4. Moving RIGHT would make (3,4) further away (would need to move LEFT later)\n5. Moving DOWN also positions me between the enemy and the apple cluster\n\n**Short-term strategy:**\n- Move DOWN toward the closest apple (3,4)\n- If the enemy also moves DOWN, I'm still ahead in the race to (3,4)\n- This move maintains good positioning for future moves toward other apples\n\nDOWN",
