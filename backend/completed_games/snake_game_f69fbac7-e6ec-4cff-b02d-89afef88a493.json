No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Strategic consideration**: There's a nice cluster of apples on the west side: (1,6), (3,8), and even (7,6) and (7,8) are reachable. Moving LEFT gets me positioned well to collect these efficiently while maintaining good board position.\n\nLEFT seems optimal as it moves me toward the densest apple cluster while maintaining safety.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves for me: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP: (6,2) - safe, empty.\n- DOWN: (6,0) - safe, empty.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - safe, empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - safe, empty.\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no bodies and I won't go off the board (all within 0-9).\n\nNow, which apple is closest? The apple at (7,6) is relatively close: distance |7-6| + |6-1| = 1+5=6. Also (1,6) is |1-6|+|6-1|=5+5=10, (3,8)=|3-6|+|8-1|=3+7=10, (7,8)=|7-6|+|8-1|=1+7=8, (9,7)=|9-6|+|7-1|=3+6=9.\n\nSo (7,6) is the closest. To get closer to (7,6), I should move right (to (7,1)) or up (to (6,2)). Moving right gets me directly closer in x, and then I need to go up. Moving up gets me closer in y, but then I need to go right.\n\nAlso consider the enemy: it's at (4,6). It might go for the apple at (3,8) or (1,6) or (7,6). But (7,6) is closer to me than to it: enemy distance to (7,6) is |4-7|+|6-6|=3+0=3, but it has to decide. However, since I'm far, it might get there first.\n\nBut I should start moving towards apples. Since I'm at (6,1), moving RIGHT to (7,1) gets me closer to (7,6) and also to (7,8) and (9,7). It also keeps me away from the enemy which is at (4,6) - so no immediate collision risk.\n\nAll moves are safe, so I should choose one that gives me more options. Moving RIGHT to (7,1) is good because from there I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (to (8,1)) or LEFT (back to (6,1)), but since I have no body, going back is safe. Similarly, moving UP to (6,2) gives options.\n\nBut to head towards the apples, RIGHT is better.\n\nAlso, the enemy might move towards (7,6) this turn: from (4,6), it can go RIGHT to (5,6), which is safe and closer to (7,6). Or it might go UP to (4,7) for (3,8) etc.\n\nSo I should not worry too much about head-on collision now since we are far apart.\n\nPlan for next turns: move towards the apple at (7,6) by going right and then up. Also, avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nSo this turn, I'll move RIGHT.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 is at head (3,6) with no body.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for safety:\n- UP: (7,2) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (7,0) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (6,1) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) - empty, safe.\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no obstacles and I won't go off the board.\n\nNow, which apple is closest? The apple at (7,6) is very close: Manhattan distance |7-7| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5. Other apples: (7,8)= |7-7|+|8-1|=0+7=7, (9,7)=|9-7|+|7-1|=2+6=8, (1,6)=|1-7|+|6-1|=6+5=11, (3,8)=|3-7|+|8-1|=4+7=11.\n\nSo (7,6) is the closest. To get to (7,6), I need to move up multiple times. Currently at (7,1), moving UP to (7,2) gets me closer in y-direction. Moving LEFT or RIGHT doesn't help directly for (7,6), and DOWN moves away.\n\nAlso consider the enemy at (3,6): it is closer to (7,6) than I am? Enemy distance to (7,6) is |3-7|+|6-6|=4+0=4, which is closer than my distance of 5. So the enemy might get there first if it moves right. However, the enemy might also go for other apples like (3,8) or (1,6).\n\nBut since (7,6) is very close to the enemy, I should not assume I can get it. Instead, I should consider other apples. The apple at (7,8) is also relatively close to me (distance 7) and requires moving up. Similarly, (9,7) is at distance 8.\n\nTo maximize my options and start moving towards the apples, moving UP is beneficial because it gets me closer to multiple apples: (7,6), (7,8), (9,7). Moving horizontally (LEFT or RIGHT) doesn't help as much for these apples.\n\nAlso, moving UP to (7,2) keeps me in the center and gives me many options next turn: from (7,2) I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy is far away at (3,6), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nTherefore, I should move UP this turn to start ascending towards the apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving up towards the apples at (7,6) and (7,8). Be aware that the enemy might be competing for (7,6). If the enemy gets there first, I can target (7,8) or (9,7). Avoid moving into the enemy's path.\n\nFinal move: UP\nUP",

Moving LEFT gets me closest to this apple and positions me to collect it on the very next turn.

The apple at (7,6) is very close: Manhattan distance |7-7| + |6-2| = 0 + 4 = 4. Other apples: (7,8)= |7-7|+|8-2|=0+6=6, (9,7)=|9-7|+|7-2|=2+5=7, (1,6)=|1-7|+|6-2|=6+4=10, (3,8)=|3-7|+|8-2|=4+6=10.\n\nSo (7,6) is the closest. To get to (7,6), I need to move up multiple times. Currently at (7,2), moving UP to (7,3) gets me closer in y-direction.\n\nConsider the enemy at (2,6): its distance to (7,6) is |2-7|+|6-6|=5+0=5, which is farther than my distance of 4. So I have a slight advantage to reach (7,6) first if I move directly up.\n\nHowever, the enemy might also move towards (7,6) by going RIGHT (to (3,6)) and then further right. But since the enemy is at (2,6), it has multiple options: it might go for (1,6) which is very close (distance 1), or (3,8) which is distance |3-2|+|8-6|=1+2=3, or (7,6) which is distance 5.\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closest to the enemy, it is likely that the enemy will go for (1,6) this turn (by moving LEFT to (1,6)) and eat it. So the enemy might not compete for (7,6) immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should continue moving UP to get closer to (7,6). Moving UP also helps for (7,8) and (9,7).\n\nMoving horizontally (LEFT or RIGHT) would not help as much for these apples.\n\nSo, UP is the best move to get closer to the apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving up towards (7,6). If the enemy eats (1,6), it will grow and have a body segment. Then I should be cautious about collisions. But for now, focus on moving up.\n\nFinal move: UP\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 is at head (1,6) with body segment at (2,6) (so it has length 2).\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for safety:\n- UP: (7,4) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (7,2) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (6,3) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - empty, safe.\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no obstacles and I won't go off the board.\n\nNow, which apple is closest? The apple at (7,6) is very close: Manhattan distance |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3. Other apples: (7,8)= |7-7|+|8-3|=0+5=5, (9,7)=|9-7|+|7-3|=2+4=6, (3,8)=|3-7|+|8-3|=4+5=9, (9,0)=|9-7|+|0-3|=2+3=5.\n\nSo (7,6) is the closest. To get to (7,6), I need to move up multiple times. Currently at (7,3), moving UP to (7,4) gets me closer in y-direction.\n\nConsider the enemy at (1,6): it has just eaten an apple (since it has 1 apple and a body segment) and is now at (1,6) with body at (2,6). The closest apple to it is (3,8) with distance |3-1|+|8-6|=2+2=4, or (7,6) with |7-1|+|6-6|=6+0=6. So it might move towards (3,8) by going RIGHT (to (2,6)) but that is its own body, so it cannot. Alternatively, it could go UP to (1,7) or DOWN to (1,5) to eventually reach (3,8) or other apples. It is unlikely to compete for (7,6) immediately.\n\nTherefore, I should continue moving UP to get closer to (7,6). Moving UP also helps for (7,8) and (9,7).\n\nMoving horizontally (LEFT or RIGHT) would not help as much for these apples.\n\nSo, UP is the best move to get closer to the apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving up towards (7,6). After eating (7,6), I will have a body segment and should be cautious about collisions. Then consider targeting (7,8) or (9,7). Avoid moving into areas where the enemy might be, but currently the enemy is far away.\n\nFinal move: UP\nUP",

It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for safety:\n- UP: (7,8) - contains an apple. Eating it is safe (grow to length 3: head moves to (7,8), body becomes [(7,7), (7,6)]).\n- DOWN: (7,6) - my own body (tail), unsafe (would die).\n- LEFT: (6,7) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,7) - empty, safe.\n\nSo DOWN is eliminated. Now consider UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nUP leads to eating the apple at (7,8). This is highly beneficial: I gain an apple and grow, which also extends my body and might help in future collisions. After eating, my head will be at (7,8) and body at [(7,7), (7,6)].\n\nLEFT to (6,7) and RIGHT to (8,7) are safe but do not immediately collect an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,8) which is also an apple location. It might eat that apple this turn (if it moves UP? But (3,8) is already an apple, so if it moves to (3,9) or elsewhere? Actually, the apple is at (3,8) and enemy head is at (3,8) - wait, no: the board shows apple at (7,8) and (3,8) is not listed? Actually, apples are at (7,8), (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (4,1). So (3,8) is not an apple. Enemy head is at (3,8) which is empty? But the board shows at row 8, column 3: \"0\" for enemy head. So (3,8) is enemy head, not an apple. The apple at (7,8) is separate.\n\nEnemy snake #0 might move towards other apples or possibly towards me, but it is far away (distance |7-3|+|7-8|=4+1=5) so no immediate threat.\n\nLong-term: Eating the apple at (7,8) is the best immediate action. It gives me an apple and growth. After eating, I will be at (7,8) with body [(7,7), (7,6)]. Then next turn, I can move from there: possible moves UP (7,9), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). DOWN would be into my body (7,7) which is unsafe. So I'll have 3 options.\n\nIf I don't eat the apple now, the enemy might come for it later, but it is currently at (3,8) which is 4 steps away (Manhattan distance to (7,8) is 4), so it cannot reach it this turn. However, if I move away, it might get it next turn? But I am right next to it.\n\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT would delay eating the apple, and possibly allow the enemy to get closer. But since the enemy is far, it's unlikely to get it before I can return.\n\nHowever, eating it now is optimal: it gives immediate points and growth, and avoids potential competition.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy snake is at (7,7) with body at (7,6).

Now consider UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nApples: The closest apple is at (9,7) (distance |7-9|+|8-7|=2+1=3) and (6,7) (|7-6|+|8-7|=1+1=2). However, (6,7) is directly below (6,8) if I move LEFT? Actually, (6,8) is left and up from (6,7). But note: moving LEFT to (6,8) does not immediately get an apple. The apple at (6,7) is adjacent to my current head? From (7,8), (6,7) is diagonally adjacent (not directly reachable in one move). So no move directly collects an apple this turn.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,8). It might move towards the apple at (4,1) or (8,2) or (9,7). It is 3 steps away from (9,7) (|4-9|+|8-7|=5+1=6? Actually Manhattan distance: |4-9|=5, |8-7|=1, total 6) so not immediate. But it might also move towards me? Distance |4-7|+|8-8|=3+0=3, so it could be a threat in a few turns.\n\nLong-term strategy: I should aim for the nearest apple. The apple at (6,7) is very close: from my head (7,8), I can reach it in two moves: e.g., LEFT to (6,8) then DOWN to (6,7) next turn. But note: moving DOWN from (6,8) would be safe only if my tail moves? Currently my body is [(7,7),(7,6)]. After moving LEFT to (6,8), my body becomes [(7,8),(7,7)] (since I didn't eat, so length same). Then next turn, DOWN to (6,7) would be safe because (6,7) is not part of my body? My body would be at (7,8) and (7,7), so (6,7) is free.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (9,7) which is farther but might be less contested.\n\nAlso, the enemy might be heading towards (8,2) or (4,1).\n\nTo keep options open, I should avoid moving into corners. UP to (7,9) is a corner? Actually (7,9) is not a corner, but it is near the top edge. LEFT to (6,8) is more central. RIGHT to (8,8) is also good.\n\nSince no immediate apple, I should move in a direction that keeps many safe moves next turn and doesn't trap me.\n\nAfter moving:\n- If UP to (7,9): next moves: DOWN (back to (7,8)), LEFT (6,9), RIGHT (8,9). All three might be safe? But (7,8) will be my body next turn? After moving, my body becomes [(7,8),(7,7)] so (7,8) is occupied. So from (7,9), DOWN would be into my body - unsafe. So only LEFT and RIGHT would be safe. So only 2 options.\n- If LEFT to (6,8): next moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), RIGHT (7,8). But (7,8) will be my body, so unsafe. So UP and DOWN are safe? Also LEFT to (5,8) might be safe. So actually: UP, DOWN, LEFT? That's 3 options.\n- If RIGHT to (8,8): similarly, next moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8) (unsafe), RIGHT (9,8). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe? That's 3 options.\n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn, while UP gives only 2.\n\nTherefore, UP is less favorable because it reduces future options.\n\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, which is better? The apple at (6,7) is closer if I go LEFT. Moving LEFT to (6,8) sets me up to go DOWN to (6,7) next turn to eat the apple. Also, the enemy is at (4,8) which is to the left, so moving LEFT might bring me closer to the enemy? But currently distance 3, so not immediate threat.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8,8) moves me towards (9,7) apple (distance |8-9|+|8-7|=1+1=2) so also good.\n\nBut (6,7) is very close and might be eaten sooner. Also, the enemy might not be going for it.\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it gets me closer to (6,7) and also there is an apple at (8,2) which is down and right, but that's farther.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving LEFT to (6,8), next turn move DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple. Then I will grow to length 4: head at (6,7), body [(6,8),(7,8),(7,7)]. Then from there, I can consider moving to other apples.\n\nSo move LEFT now.\n\nFinal move: LEFT\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy head is at (7,8) with body [(7,7),(7,6)]. DOWN is unsafe. UP leads to (7,9) which only has 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT and RIGHT) because DOWN will be into my body. LEFT to (6,8) and RIGHT to (8,8) both give 3 safe moves next turn. I choose LEFT because it positions me to easily get the apple at (6,7) next turn (by moving DOWN). This is efficient and avoids reducing future options. Enemy at (4,8) is not an immediate threat.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nMy snake (ID 1) has head at (6,8) and body at [(7,8), (7,7)] (after moving LEFT last turn). I have collected 2 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (4,1), (6,7)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (5,8) and body at [(4,8), (3,8)]. It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for safety:\n- UP: (6,9) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,7) - contains an apple. If I move here, I eat the apple and grow. This is safe because it is not my body (my body is at (7,8) and (7,7)) and not enemy body.\n- LEFT: (5,8) - enemy head is at (5,8). This would be a head-on collision: both heads moving into same cell? But note: enemy will also move this turn. However, I don't know where enemy will move. If enemy moves to (5,8) and I move to (5,8), we collide and both die. But if enemy moves elsewhere, (5,8) might be safe. However, since we move simultaneously, I cannot predict exactly. But moving LEFT into (5,8) is risky because enemy might also move there (e.g., if enemy moves RIGHT). So it is potentially unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - my own body (the segment behind my head). Unsafe (would die).\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated. LEFT is risky due to potential head-on collision with enemy. UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nNow consider UP and DOWN:\n- DOWN to (6,7): collects the apple. This increases my length to 4 and score to 3. After eating, my body becomes [(6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)].\n- UP to (6,9): does not collect an apple.\n\nWhich is better? Collecting the apple is good, but I must also consider future moves.\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,7) and eating:\n- My head at (6,7), body: [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7)]\n- Next moves: UP (6,8) - but (6,8) is my body (the segment just behind head), so unsafe. DOWN (6,6) - safe. LEFT (5,7) - safe. RIGHT (7,7) - my body, unsafe.\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe. That gives 2 options.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,9):\n- My head at (6,9), body: [(6,8), (7,8)]\n- Next moves: DOWN (6,8) - my body, unsafe. LEFT (5,9) - safe. RIGHT (7,9) - safe.\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Also 2 options.\n\nBoth moves lead to only 2 safe moves next turn. However, DOWN collects an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nNow consider the enemy: it is at (5,8). It might move towards the apple at (6,7) as well. If I don't take it this turn, enemy might take it next turn. So it is better to secure it now.\n\nThe risk with LEFT: moving to (5,8) could cause a head-on collision if enemy moves RIGHT. But enemy has other options: it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. From (5,8), enemy's possible moves:\n- UP: (5,9) - safe?\n- DOWN: (5,7) - safe?\n- LEFT: (4,8) - its own body? Enemy body is [(4,8), (3,8)], so (4,8) is its body segment - unsafe for enemy.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) - currently my head? But I will move away.\n\nSo enemy cannot move LEFT (into its own body). So enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6,8), and I move LEFT to (5,8), we don't collide. But if enemy moves to (5,8) (which it can't because that is its current head? Wait, enemy head is at (5,8) now. So enemy cannot move to (5,8) because that is its current position. Actually, enemy moves from its head position. So from (5,8), enemy moves to a new cell.\n\nTherefore, (5,8) will be empty after enemy moves? Not necessarily: if enemy moves UP, (5,8) becomes part of its body? But since it didn't eat, it moves and leaves its tail behind. So (5,8) might be free.\n\nBut still, if I move to (5,8), and enemy moves to (5,8) from its current position? That is impossible because enemy is already at (5,8). So enemy is moving away from (5,8). Therefore, (5,8) should be safe this turn.\n\nWait: enemy head is at (5,8). When it moves, its head goes to a new cell, and its body follows. So the cell (5,8) becomes occupied by its body (the segment behind the head) after the move. So if I move to (5,8), I would be moving into the enemy's body (after they move), which kills me.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (5,8) is unsafe because it will be occupied by enemy's body after they move.\n\nSo LEFT is unsafe.\n\nThus, only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, DOWN collects an apple and is better.\n\nSo move DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,7), I will have limited moves (only DOWN and LEFT). I should plan to move DOWN to (6,6) or LEFT to (5,7) next turn to avoid getting trapped. The apple at (8,2) and (9,7) are other targets. Enemy is at (5,8) and might be a threat.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nOnly UP and DOWN are safe. LEFT is unsafe because (5,8) will be occupied by enemy's body after they move. RIGHT is my own body. DOWN collects the apple at (6,7), increasing my score to 3 and length to 4. Although both UP and DOWN lead to only 2 safe moves next turn, taking the apple is advantageous. Enemy might take it if I don't. So move DOWN.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

I have collected 3 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (4,1), (5,1)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (3,7) and body: [(4,7), (5,7)]. It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for safety:\n- UP: (5,7) - enemy snake #0's body segment (at (5,7)). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,5) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,6) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,6) - my own body (the segment behind my head). Unsafe.\n\nSo only two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider the apples: The closest apples are at (4,1) and (5,1) to the bottom-left. Moving LEFT (to (4,6)) gets me closer to those apples. Moving DOWN (to (5,5)) also moves me in that direction but less directly.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: Enemy snake #0 is at (3,7). It might be heading towards the same apples. To avoid potential head-on collisions, I should not move directly towards the enemy. Moving LEFT (to (4,6)) is closer to the enemy, but not directly adjacent. The enemy head is at (3,7), which is one step away diagonally. However, since we move simultaneously, there is no immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: I should aim to collect the apples at (4,1) and (5,1). The path is: move LEFT to (4,6), then DOWN to (4,5), then DOWN to (4,4), and so on. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) and then LEFT to (4,5) is also good. However, moving LEFT now is more efficient.\n\nAlso, check for future safety: After moving LEFT to (4,6), my next moves could be DOWN or LEFT (to (3,6) or (4,5)). The enemy is at (3,7), so (3,6) might be risky if the enemy moves DOWN to (3,6) simultaneously. But that is a head-on collision risk only if both move there. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (5,5) gives me options to go LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4), which are safer from the enemy.\n\nGiven that the enemy is close (at (3,7)), I should avoid moving too close to it. Moving DOWN to (5,5) is safer and still progresses towards the apples. From (5,5), I can go LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4). Both are good.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN to avoid potential conflict with the enemy and to maintain flexibility.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT. Apples at (4,1) and (5,1) are closest. Moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe and progresses towards apples while avoiding the enemy at (3,7). Enemy might move towards apples too, so caution is needed. Plan: move DOWN to (5,5), then consider LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4) next turn to approach apples safely.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,2) - within board (x=5), currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples: The closest apples are at (4,1) and (5,1). Moving DOWN to (4,1) directly eats the apple. This is highly beneficial as it grows my snake and increases my score. Moving LEFT or RIGHT does not immediately get an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,4). It might also be interested in the apples below. However, I am at (4,2) and can move DOWN to (4,1) to eat it this turn. The enemy is at (3,4), which is 3 units away from (4,1) (needs to go down three times), so I can definitely get there first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4,1), my snake will grow by one segment. The new body will be: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the tail remains at (4,5).\n\nNext turn, I can aim for the apple at (5,1). From (4,1), I can move RIGHT to (5,1) to eat it. Alternatively, I can move DOWN to (4,0) or LEFT to (3,1). But (5,1) is the priority.\n\nCheck for future safety after each move:\n- DOWN to (4,1): Eating apple. Next moves: LEFT (to (3,1)), RIGHT (to (5,1)), or DOWN (to (4,0)). All are safe currently. Moving RIGHT to (5,1) eats another apple.\n- LEFT to (3,2): Next moves: DOWN (to (3,1)), LEFT (to (2,2)), UP (to (3,3)). (3,1) is safe and close to apple at (4,1) but I might not get it if enemy moves. (2,2) is safe. (3,3) is safe but not beneficial.\n- RIGHT to (5,2): Next moves: DOWN (to (5,1)), RIGHT (to (6,2)), UP (to (5,3)). (5,1) is an apple, so good.\n\nHowever, moving DOWN immediately gets an apple and sets me up for the next apple at (5,1). Moving LEFT or RIGHT delays eating an apple.\n\nEnemy proximity: The enemy head is at (3,4). Moving LEFT to (3,2) is two steps below the enemy, which is safe. Moving RIGHT is also safe. But DOWN is the most rewarding.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the best choice to immediately eat the apple and increase my score.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving DOWN to (4,1) and eating the apple, I should move RIGHT to (5,1) to eat the next apple. Then, consider moving towards other apples or avoiding the enemy. The enemy might be moving down towards the apples as well, but I am already there.\n\nI choose DOWN to eat the apple and grow.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

I have collected 4 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (5,1), (7,3)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (3,3) and body: [(3,4), (2,4)]. It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (4,2) - my own body (the segment directly behind my head). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,0) - within board (y=0), currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,1) - within board (x=3), currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,1) - within board (x=5), currently an apple. Safe (eating apple is allowed).\n\nSo three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples: The closest apple is at (5,1), which is directly to the RIGHT. Moving RIGHT immediately eats this apple, growing my snake to 5 segments. The other apples are farther away: (7,3) is 4 moves away (right and up), (8,2) is 5 moves, (9,0) is 6 moves, (9,7) is 9 moves.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,3). It might be interested in the apple at (5,1) or (7,3). However, I am at (4,1) and can move RIGHT to (5,1) to eat it this turn. The enemy is at (3,3), which is 3 units away from (5,1) (needs to go right twice and down once, or similar), so I can get there first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,1), my snake will grow: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The tail remains at (4,5).\n\nNext turn, from (5,1), I can consider moving towards other apples: UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), LEFT to (4,1) (which is now my body), or RIGHT to (6,1). Moving LEFT would be unsafe (into my own body), so only UP, DOWN, RIGHT would be safe. So I need to plan to avoid trapping myself.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,1) or DOWN to (4,0) does not get an apple this turn. While safe, they delay eating and might allow the enemy to get the apple.\n\nCheck future safety after each move:\n- RIGHT to (5,1): Eating apple. Next moves: UP (to (5,2)), DOWN (to (5,0)), RIGHT (to (6,1)). All are safe currently. However, moving LEFT to (4,1) would be unsafe (my body). So I have 3 options next turn.\n- LEFT to (3,1): Next moves: UP (to (3,2)), DOWN (to (3,0)), LEFT (to (2,1)). All safe. But no apple this turn.\n- DOWN to (4,0): Next moves: LEFT (to (3,0)), RIGHT (to (5,0)), UP (to (4,1) - unsafe, my body). So only LEFT and RIGHT safe. Limited options.\n\nMoving RIGHT gives immediate apple and good options next turn. Moving LEFT or DOWN gives no apple and fewer options (especially DOWN only has two safe moves next turn).\n\nEnemy proximity: The enemy head is at (3,3). Moving LEFT to (3,1) is directly below the enemy, which might be risky if the enemy moves down. But currently safe.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best choice to eat the apple and grow. It also positions me well for moving towards the apple at (7,3) or (8,2) in the future.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (5,1) and eating the apple, I should avoid moving LEFT (into my body). Consider UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1) to start moving towards (7,3). DOWN to (5,0) is also safe but leads to the edge.\n\nI choose RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Apple at (5,1) is directly right. Moving RIGHT eats it immediately, growing to 5 segments. Next turn, from (5,1), safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (avoid LEFT into own body). Plan to move towards (7,3) via UP and RIGHT. Enemy at (3,3) is not an immediate threat. Avoid UP (into own body). LEFT and DOWN are safe but do not get an apple. Prioritize eating to increase score and length.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

This:\n1. Moves me away from Snake #1's territory\n2. Opens a path toward the northeast apples at (7, 3) and (8, 2)\n3.

I have collected 5 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (7,3), (3,5)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (2,3) and body: [(3,3), (3,4)]. It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (5,2) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,0) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,1) - my own body (the segment directly behind my head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,1) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The closest apple is at (7,3), which is 3 moves away (e.g., RIGHT to (6,1), then RIGHT to (7,1), then UP to (7,2) and UP to (7,3)? Actually, from (5,1) to (7,3) is 4 moves (Manhattan distance: |7-5| + |3-1| = 2+2=4).\n- Other apples: (8,2) is 5 moves (|8-5|+|2-1|=3+1=4, but need to avoid obstacles), (3,5) is 4 moves (|3-5|+|5-1|=2+4=6? Actually Manhattan is 6), (9,0) is 5 moves (|9-5|+|0-1|=4+1=5), (9,7) is 10 moves.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,3). It might be interested in the apple at (3,5) (which is close to it) or (7,3). I should aim for (7,3) or (8,2).\n\nFrom my head (5,1), moving RIGHT to (6,1) gets me closer to (7,3) and (8,2). Moving UP to (5,2) also gets me closer, but RIGHT is more direct. Moving DOWN to (5,0) leads away from most apples.\n\nNext turn safety:\n- If I move RIGHT to (6,1): next moves would be UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), RIGHT (7,1). All should be safe (currently empty). LEFT to (5,1) would be unsafe (my body).\n- If I move UP to (5,2): next moves would be UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1) - unsafe (my body), LEFT (4,2) - unsafe (my body), RIGHT (6,2). So only UP and RIGHT safe. Limited options.\n- If I move DOWN to (5,0): next moves would be DOWN (5,-1) - off board (die), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0). So only LEFT and RIGHT safe. Very limited.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT provides the best future options (3 safe moves next turn) and moves me towards the apples at (7,3) and (8,2). Moving UP gives only 2 safe moves next turn, and moving DOWN gives only 2 safe moves and is near the edge.\n\nEnemy proximity: The enemy is at (2,3), which is not close to my path to (6,1). It might move towards (3,5) or other directions.\n\nI should avoid moving UP because it limits my next moves (only two safe directions) and doesn't progress as well towards the apples. DOWN is even worse.\n\nSo RIGHT is the best choice.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (6,1), I should consider moving UP to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,1) to approach (7,3). Avoid moving LEFT back into my body.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (6,1) is optimal: it provides 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and moves towards apples (7,3) and (8,2). Moving UP to (5,2) limits next moves (only UP and RIGHT safe) and moving DOWN to (5,0) limits next moves (only LEFT and RIGHT) and is near edge. Enemy at (2,3) is not a threat to this path.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nMy snake (ID 1) has head at (6,1) and body: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]. I have collected 5 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (7,3), (3,5)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (2,4) and body: [(2,3), (3,3)]. It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (6,2) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,0) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - my own body (the segment directly behind my head). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - within board, currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- The closest apples are (7,3) and (8,2). (7,3) is 2 moves away (e.g., UP to (6,2) then UP to (6,3) and RIGHT to (7,3)? Actually from (6,1) to (7,3): Manhattan distance |7-6| + |3-1| = 1+2=3 moves. Similarly, (8,2) is |8-6|+|2-1|=2+1=3 moves.\n- (9,0) is |9-6|+|0-1|=3+1=4 moves, (9,7) is far, (3,5) is far and behind me.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,4). It might be interested in (3,5) which is close. It is not a direct threat to me.\n\nNext turn safety:\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,1): next moves would be UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), RIGHT (8,1). All should be safe (currently empty). LEFT to (6,1) would be unsafe (my body). So 3 safe moves.\n- If I move UP to (6,2): next moves would be UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1) - unsafe (my body), LEFT (5,2) - unsafe (enemy body? Actually (5,2) is empty now, but check: enemy body is at (2,3) and (3,3), so (5,2) is safe), RIGHT (7,2). So UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe? Actually DOWN is unsafe. So UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe? Wait: LEFT (5,2) is empty? Yes, board shows empty at (5,2). So 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- If I move DOWN to (6,0): next moves would be DOWN (6,-1) - off board (die), LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0). So only LEFT and RIGHT safe. Very limited (2 moves).\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is bad because it limits future options. Both UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,1) gets me closer to (7,3) and (8,2). From (7,1), I can go UP to (7,2) then UP to (7,3) to eat the apple.\n- Moving UP to (6,2) also gets me closer to (7,3) and (8,2). From (6,2), I can go RIGHT to (7,2) then UP to (7,3).\n\nBoth are good, but RIGHT might be slightly more direct? Actually similar.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: it is at (2,4) and might move towards (3,5). It is not near my path.\n\nAnother factor: my body is behind me. Moving UP or RIGHT avoids it.\n\nI should avoid moving DOWN because it is near the edge and limits options.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are good. However, moving RIGHT to (7,1) might be better because it opens a path to the right side apples (7,3) and (8,2) without going through the center where my body is. Also, (7,1) is closer to (9,0) if needed later.\n\nMoving UP to (6,2) is also good, but it might lead me closer to the enemy? Not really.\n\nActually, both are equivalent. But since last move I went RIGHT, continuing RIGHT might be consistent.\n\nLong-term: I want to collect apples at (7,3) and (8,2). Moving RIGHT puts me at (7,1), from which I can go UP to (7,2) and then to (7,3). Moving UP puts me at (6,2), from which I can go RIGHT to (7,2) and then UP to (7,3). Same number of moves.\n\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (7,1), I have the option to go RIGHT again to (8,1) to approach (8,2). If I move UP to (6,2), I have to go RIGHT to (7,2) and then RIGHT to (8,2) or UP to (7,3). So similar.\n\nBut note: the apple at (7,3) is directly above (7,1), so moving RIGHT then UP is efficient.\n\nAlso, the board has an apple at (9,0) which is far, and (9,7) which is very far.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because it moves me horizontally towards the apples.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving RIGHT to (7,1), next turn I should move UP to (7,2) to approach (7,3). Avoid moving LEFT back into my body.\n\nEnemy is not a threat.\n\nSo choose RIGHT.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (7,1) is optimal: it provides 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and moves towards apples (7,3) and (8,2). Moving UP to (6,2) also provides 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) and moves towards apples, but RIGHT is more direct for the horizontal progression. Moving DOWN to (6,0) limits next moves (only LEFT and RIGHT) and is near edge. Enemy at (2,4) is not a threat. Prioritize maintaining mobility and progressing towards apples.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

It has collected 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (7,2) - within board, currently empty (board shows '.' at (7,2)).

Safe.\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider next turn safety:\n- If I move UP to (7,2): next moves would be UP (7,3) - apple (safe to move, but if I eat it I grow), DOWN (7,1) - unsafe (my body), LEFT (6,2) - empty (safe), RIGHT (8,2) - apple (safe to move, but if I eat it I grow). So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

So only LEFT and RIGHT safe. (2 safe moves) - risky.\n- If I move RIGHT to (8,1): next moves would be UP (8,2) - apple (safe), DOWN (8,0) - empty (safe), LEFT (7,1) - unsafe (my body), RIGHT (9,1) - empty (safe). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. (3 safe moves)\n\nMoving DOWN is bad because it limits future options (only 2 safe moves next turn).

(7,3) is directly above me at (7,1): distance |7-7| + |3-1| = 0+2=2 moves away (e.g., UP to (7,2) then UP to (7,3)).\n- (8,2) is at |8-7| + |2-1| = 1+1=2 moves away (e.g., RIGHT to (8,1) then UP to (8,2)).\n- Moving UP to (7,2) puts me adjacent to both (7,3) (above) and (8,2) (right and up). From (7,2), I can go UP to (7,3) or RIGHT to (8,2) (then UP to (8,2) if needed? Actually (8,2) is at same y, so from (7,2) to (8,2) is RIGHT only).\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,1) puts me adjacent to (8,2) (above) and closer to (9,0) (down and right) but farther from (7,3).\n\nSo moving UP is better for both apples: it positions me to choose between (7,3) and (8,2) next turn. Moving RIGHT only gets me closer to (8,2) but not (7,3).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) and might be targeting (3,5).

Moving UP to (7,2) is optimal: it provides 3 safe moves next turn (UP to (7,3) for apple, LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2) for apple) and positions me equidistant to both nearby apples (7,3) and (8,2). Moving RIGHT to (8,1) also provides 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) but is only adjacent to (8,2) and not (7,3). Moving DOWN to (7,0) limits next moves (only LEFT and RIGHT) and is near edge.

Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,2) - within board, currently has an apple (so safe to move there). Safe.\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider next turn safety for each safe move:\n- If I move UP to (7,3): I eat the apple and grow. My new head will be at (7,3), and my body will be longer. Next moves from (7,3): UP (7,4) - empty (safe), DOWN (7,2) - unsafe (my new body? Actually, after eating, my tail doesn't move immediately? Wait, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of your body, but your head moves forward and the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving UP to (7,3) and eating, my body becomes: head at (7,3), then (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2) [tail]. So from (7,3), possible next moves: UP (7,4) - empty (safe), DOWN (7,2) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (6,3) - empty (safe), RIGHT (8,3) - empty (safe). So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

(3 safe moves)\n\nMoving LEFT is bad because it only gives 2 safe moves next turn. Both UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (7,3) eats an apple immediately.\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,2) eats an apple immediately.\n- After eating (7,3), I am at (7,3). Nearby apples: (8,2) is adjacent (RIGHT and DOWN? Actually (8,2) is at x+1,y-1, not directly adjacent). But (9,7) is far, (9,0) is far, (4,6) is closer? From (7,3), (4,6) is |4-7|+|6-3|=3+3=6 moves away.\n- After eating (8,2), I am at (8,2). Nearby apples: (7,3) is adjacent (LEFT and UP), (9,0) is |9-8|+|0-2|=1+2=3 moves away, (9,7) is |9-8|+|7-2|=1+5=6 moves away, (4,6) is |4-8|+|6-2|=4+4=8 moves away.\nSo both positions are good.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,5) and might be targeting (4,6) (which is close to it). It is not a threat to me currently.\n\nLong-term: After eating one apple, I should consider the next one. (4,6) is near the enemy, so perhaps avoid that for now. (9,0) and (9,7) are on the edges.\n\nMoving UP to (7,3) eats the apple and leaves me with good options (UP to (7,4), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3)).\nMoving RIGHT to (8,2) eats the apple and leaves me with options (UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1), RIGHT to (9,2)).\n\nBoth are good, but moving UP might be slightly better because it doesn't move me too far right, keeping the left side open for future maneuvers.\n\nAlso, note that moving RIGHT to (8,2) might put me closer to the edge (x=8), while (7,3) is more central.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving UP to (7,3) eats an apple immediately and provides 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Moving RIGHT to (8,2) also eats an apple and provides 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Moving LEFT to (6,2) is suboptimal (only 2 safe moves next turn). Between UP and RIGHT, UP is chosen because it keeps me more centrally positioned (at (7,3)) with access to multiple directions, while RIGHT moves me to the right edge (x=8). Enemy at (3,5) is not a threat. After eating, target (9,0) or (9,7) next.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN allows me to eat (8,2) now and then potentially go to (9,0) next (which is only 3 moves away). However, moving DOWN only gives 2 safe moves next turn, which is riskier.\n\nMoving UP gives 3 safe moves next turn and positions me well for (9,7) (4 moves away) and (9,0) (5 moves away). It also avoids reducing my options.\n\nMoving RIGHT gives only 2 safe moves and puts me on the edge (x=9), which might be limiting.\n\nGiven that I have 6 apples and enemy has 4, I should prioritize safety to avoid dying. UP is the safest move with 3 options next turn. Eating (8,2) is tempting but reduces my next moves to 2, which might lead to traps later. Also, note that (8,2) is adjacent to my body at (7,2) and (8,3), so after eating it, I have fewer exits.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move for safety and maintaining flexibility.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. UP provides 3 safe moves next turn, while DOWN and RIGHT only provide 2. Although DOWN eats the apple at (8,2), it reduces future options and might lead to traps. UP keeps me safe and positions me to target (9,7) or (9,0) later. Avoid risk since I lead in apples (6 vs 4).

I have collected 6 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (5,9)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (4,7) and body: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]. It has collected 4 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (8,5) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- DOWN: (8,3) - within board, but my own body (unsafe).\n- LEFT: (7,4) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (9,4) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider next turn safety for each safe move:\n- If I move UP to (8,5): My new head at (8,5), body becomes [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1)] (since I didn't eat an apple). Next moves from (8,5): UP (8,6) - empty (safe), DOWN (8,4) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (7,5) - empty (safe), RIGHT (9,5) - empty (safe). So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).\n- If I move LEFT to (7,4): My new head at (7,4), body becomes [(7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (7,4): UP (7,5) - empty (safe), DOWN (7,3) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (6,4) - empty (safe), RIGHT (8,4) - my body (unsafe). So safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 safe moves).\n- If I move RIGHT to (9,4): My new head at (9,4), body becomes [(9,4), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (9,4): UP (9,5) - empty (safe), DOWN (9,3) - empty (safe), LEFT (8,4) - my body (unsafe), RIGHT (10,4) - off board (unsafe). So safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).\n\nSo UP gives 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives 2, RIGHT gives 2.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (8,5): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-8|+|7-5|=1+2=3 moves), (5,9) (|5-8|+|9-5|=3+4=7 moves), (9,0) (|9-8|+|0-5|=1+5=6 moves), (1,1) (|1-8|+|1-5|=7+4=11 moves).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,4): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-4|=2+3=5 moves), (5,9) (|5-7|+|9-4|=2+5=7 moves), (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-4|=1+2=3 moves), (9,0) (|9-7|+|0-4|=2+4=6 moves), (1,1) (|1-7|+|1-4|=6+3=9 moves).\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,4): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-9|+|7-4|=0+3=3 moves), (9,0) (|9-9|+|0-4|=0+4=4 moves), (5,9) (|5-9|+|9-4|=4+5=9 moves), (1,1) (|1-9|+|1-4|=8+3=11 moves).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,7) and might target (5,9) or (1,1). It is not a threat to me currently.\n\nLong-term: After this move, I should aim to eat (9,7) or (9,0). Moving UP positions me well for (9,7) (only 3 moves away) and also keeps 3 safe options next turn. Moving RIGHT also gets me close to (9,7) and (9,0), but only gives 2 safe moves next turn. Moving LEFT gives access to (8,2) (3 moves away) but also only 2 safe moves.\n\nGiven that I have 6 apples and enemy has 4, I should prioritize safety to avoid dying. UP is the safest move with 3 options next turn. It also moves me towards (9,7), which is a high-value target.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move for safety and progress towards an apple.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP provides 3 safe moves next turn, while LEFT and RIGHT only provide 2. UP moves me towards (9,7) (3 moves away) and maintains flexibility. Avoid risk since I lead in apples (6 vs 4). Long-term: After UP, consider moving towards (9,7) or (9,0) while avoiding the enemy at (4,7). Note: Enemy might be heading towards (5,9) or (1,1), so stay clear of those areas.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Next moves from (8,7): UP (8,8) - empty (safe), DOWN (8,6) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (7,7) - empty (safe), RIGHT (9,7) - apple (safe if eaten, but check: if I eat, I grow so tail doesn't move, but still safe to enter). So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).\n- If I move LEFT to (7,6): My new head at (7,6), body becomes [(7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1)] (no apple eaten).

So safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).\n\nSo UP and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives only 2.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (8,7): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-8|+|7-7|=1+0=1 move), (5,9) (|5-8|+|9-7|=3+2=5 moves), (9,0) (|9-8|+|0-7|=1+7=8 moves), (8,2) (|8-8|+|2-7|=0+5=5 moves), (1,1) (|1-8|+|1-7|=7+6=13 moves).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6): Closest apples: (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-6|=1+4=5 moves), (5,9) (|5-7|+|9-6|=2+3=5 moves), (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-6|=2+1=3 moves), (9,0) (|9-7|+|0-6|=2+6=8 moves), (1,1) (|1-7|+|1-6|=6+5=11 moves).\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,6): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-9|+|7-6|=0+1=1 move), (9,0) (|9-9|+|0-6|=0+6=6 moves), (5,9) (|5-9|+|9-6|=4+3=7 moves), (8,2) (|8-9|+|2-6|=1+4=5 moves), (1,1) (|1-9|+|1-6|=8+5=13 moves).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,8). It is very close to (5,9) (one move away) and might move there. It could also move towards other apples. It is not an immediate threat to me.\n\nUP is very attractive because it puts me one move away from (9,7) and has good future options. LEFT is also safe but slightly farther from apples. RIGHT gets me close to (9,7) but has fewer safe moves next turn.\n\nGiven that I have 6 apples vs enemy's 4, I should prioritize safety and efficient apple collection. UP is safe and moves me directly towards (9,7). After eating (9,7), I can consider (9,0) or (8,2). Enemy is likely to take (5,9) this turn, so I should avoid that area.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move for immediate progress and safety.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP and LEFT provide 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT only 2. UP moves me to (8,7), one step from (9,7) apple. Enemy is near (5,9) and not a threat. After eating (9,7), consider moving down towards (9,0) or left to (8,2). Maintain safety by avoiding dead ends. With 6 apples, focus on reaching 30 efficiently.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

So safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).\n\nSo UP and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives only 2.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (8,8): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-8|+|7-8|=1+1=2 moves), (9,0) (|9-8|+|0-8|=1+8=9 moves), (8,2) (|8-8|+|2-8|=0+6=6 moves), (1,1) (|1-8|+|1-8|=7+7=14 moves), (0,3) (|0-8|+|3-8|=8+5=13 moves).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,7): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-7|=2+0=2 moves), (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-7|=1+5=6 moves), (9,0) (|9-7|+|0-7|=2+7=9 moves), (1,1) (|1-7|+|1-7|=6+6=12 moves), (0,3) (|0-7|+|3-7|=7+4=11 moves).\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,7): I eat (9,7) immediately. Then remaining apples: (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (0,3). From (9,7), closest is (9,0) (|9-9|+|0-7|=0+7=7 moves) or (8,2) (|8-9|+|2-7|=1+5=6 moves).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (5,9). It might move towards (9,7) or (8,2) or (0,3). It is not an immediate threat to me.\n\nRIGHT is attractive because it gives me an apple immediately (7 apples vs enemy's 5), but it reduces my future moves to only 2. UP and LEFT are safer for the future.\n\nGiven that I have 6 apples and enemy has 5, eating (9,7) would give me a lead (7 vs 5). However, after eating it, I might be trapped at the top-right corner with only two moves. But I can plan to move down from (9,7) towards (9,0) or left towards (8,2). But (9,0) is far and (8,2) is closer.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (8,8) keeps me safe and I can still get (9,7) next turn (if enemy doesn't take it) or other apples. Moving LEFT to (7,7) also keeps options open.\n\nEnemy might move towards (9,7) this turn? From (5,9), it can move DOWN to (5,8) (its own body), LEFT to (4,9) (empty), RIGHT to (6,9) (empty), or UP? (5,10) off board. So it has safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. It might not go directly to (9,7) this turn.\n\nBut to be safe, I should consider that (9,7) might be taken by enemy if I don't grab it now.\n\nHowever, my long-term safety is important. With RIGHT, I have only 2 moves next turn, which is risky. UP and LEFT give 3 moves.\n\nI should prioritize safety. UP is safe and moves me to (8,8), from where I can go to (9,8) next and then (9,7) if still there, or other directions. Also, from (8,8), I can access the top row easily.\n\nLEFT is also safe and central.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (8,8) to maintain flexibility. If enemy doesn't take (9,7), I can get it next turn. Otherwise, I can go for (8,2) or (9,0) later.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP and LEFT provide 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT only 2. RIGHT eats (9,7) immediately but risks trapping me in corner. UP moves to (8,8) for better future options. Enemy at (5,9) may not reach (9,7) this turn. From (8,8), I can access (9,7) next turn if available, or move towards other apples. Maintain safety with multiple exits.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This would bring me to 6 apples, tying with Snake #1. Snake #1 is at (8, 8), and they could potentially reach (9, 7) in 2 moves via (9, 8) then (9, 7), or (8, 7) then (9, 7). I'm currently 3 moves away (need to go RIGHT twice more). This seems risky for head-on collision.\n\n- **DOWN (6, 8)**: Safe move that gives me more space and opens up the southern area. I can then potentially head toward apple at (1, 1) or (0, 3). This avoids potential conflict with Snake #1 who seems to be targeting the northern apples.\n\n**Head-on collision risk assessment:**\nSnake #1 at (8, 8) has several moves available. They might go:\n- LEFT to (7, 8) - safe for them\n- DOWN to (8, 7) - but their body is there, so this would be suicide\n- RIGHT to (9, 8) - safe, moving toward (9, 7)\n- UP to (8, 9) - safe\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 9), and Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (9, 8), we'll both be heading toward (9, 7) creating potential for head-on collision in future moves.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN to (6, 8) is the safer choice. It keeps me alive, opens up more options, and avoids direct competition with Snake #1 for the (9, 7) apple in the next couple of turns. I can reassess the board after this move and potentially target apples in the southern or eastern regions.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Play defensively, avoid direct confrontation with Snake #1, and look for opportunities to collect apples in less contested areas. Consider targeting (8, 2) or (1, 1) apples after moving south.\n\nDOWN",

I have collected 6 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (0,3)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,9) and body: [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]. It has collected 5 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (8,9) - within board (0<=x,y<=9), currently empty (safe).\n- DOWN: (8,7) - within board, but my own body (unsafe).\n- LEFT: (7,8) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (9,8) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider next turn safety for each safe move:\n- If I move UP to (8,9): My new head at (8,9), body becomes [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)] (since I didn't eat an apple). Next moves from (8,9): UP (8,10) - off board (unsafe), DOWN (8,8) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (7,9) - empty (safe), RIGHT (9,9) - empty (safe). So safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 safe moves).\n- If I move LEFT to (7,8): My new head at (7,8), body becomes [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (7,8): UP (7,9) - empty (safe), DOWN (7,7) - empty (safe), LEFT (6,8) - empty (safe), RIGHT (8,8) - my body (unsafe). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 safe moves).\n- If I move RIGHT to (9,8): My new head at (9,8), body becomes [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (9,8): UP (9,9) - empty (safe), DOWN (9,7) - has an apple (safe to enter), LEFT (8,8) - my body (unsafe), RIGHT (10,8) - off board (unsafe). So safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 safe moves).\n\nSo LEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn, UP and RIGHT give only 2.\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (8,9): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-8|+|7-9|=1+2=3 moves), (9,0) (|9-8|+|0-9|=1+9=10 moves), (8,2) (|8-8|+|2-9|=0+7=7 moves), (1,1) (|1-8|+|1-9|=7+8=15 moves), (0,3) (|0-8|+|3-9|=8+6=14 moves).\n- Moving LEFT to (7,8): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-8|=2+1=3 moves), (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-8|=1+6=7 moves), (9,0) (|9-7|+|0-8|=2+8=10 moves), (1,1) (|1-7|+|1-8|=6+7=13 moves), (0,3) (|0-7|+|3-8|=7+5=12 moves).\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,8): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-9|+|7-8|=0+1=1 move), (9,0) (|9-9|+|0-8|=0+8=8 moves), (8,2) (|8-9|+|2-8|=1+6=7 moves), (1,1) (|1-9|+|1-8|=8+7=15 moves), (0,3) (|0-9|+|3-8|=9+5=14 moves).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,9). It might move towards (9,7) or other apples. From (6,9), it can move UP (6,10) off board, DOWN (6,8) empty, LEFT (5,9) its own body, RIGHT (7,9) empty. So safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. It might go RIGHT to (7,9) or DOWN to (6,8). It is not an immediate threat to me.\n\nRIGHT is attractive because it gets me very close to (9,7) (1 move away), but it only gives 2 safe moves next turn. LEFT gives 3 safe moves and is central. UP is less favorable due to fewer moves and being at the top edge.\n\nLong-term plan: I should avoid getting trapped at the edges. Moving LEFT to (7,8) keeps me in a central position with multiple exits. From there, I can go towards (8,2) or (9,7) later. Also, enemy might be moving towards (9,7), so I shouldn't rush there if it risks a collision or dead-end.\n\nPrioritize safety and flexibility: LEFT is the best choice.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT provides 3 safe moves next turn, UP and RIGHT only 2. RIGHT gets close to (9,7) but risks fewer exits. LEFT moves to (7,8) for better central positioning and future options. Enemy at (6,9) may move RIGHT to (7,9) or DOWN to (6,8), not an immediate threat. From (7,8), I can access multiple apples safely. Maintain safety with multiple exits.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN keeps me alive and positions me to either:\n1. Continue south toward the apple at (1, 1) \n2. Potentially swing east toward the apple at (8, 2) \n3.

I have collected 6 apples.\nApples are at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (0,3)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,8) and body: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7)]. It has collected 5 apples.\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck each move for immediate safety:\n- UP: (7,9) - within board (0<=x,y<=9), currently empty (safe).\n- DOWN: (7,7) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- LEFT: (6,8) - within board, but enemy snake #0's head is at (6,8) - this would cause a head-on collision (both die) if enemy also moves into (6,8)? Actually, enemy is at (6,8) now, but we move simultaneously. If I move LEFT to (6,8), and enemy moves away, it might be safe? But wait: enemy head is currently at (6,8). If I move to (6,8), and enemy moves to another cell, then (6,8) becomes empty? However, rules: if two heads move into the same cell, both die. But here, I am moving to (6,8) which is currently occupied by enemy head. However, since we move simultaneously, the enemy head will also move to a new cell. So after movement, (6,8) might be free if enemy moves away. But if enemy stays? Actually, enemy cannot stay because it must move. So (6,8) will be free after enemy moves? But careful: the current board state is before movement. Enemy head is at (6,8). When enemy moves, it leaves (6,8). So if I move LEFT to (6,8), and enemy moves to say (6,7) or (7,8), then (6,8) becomes free. However, there is a risk: if enemy moves to (6,8)? But enemy cannot move to (6,8) because it is its own current head? Actually, enemy can only move to adjacent cells: from (6,8), it can go UP (6,9) - its own body (unsafe), DOWN (6,7) - empty, LEFT (5,8) - empty, RIGHT (7,8) - my head? But (7,8) is my current head, but I will move. So enemy might move to (7,8) if I leave? This is complex.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think: moving to a cell that is currently occupied by an enemy head is dangerous because if the enemy decides to stay (which it cannot, it must move) or if it moves to the same cell I am moving to? Actually, no: we are moving simultaneously. The cell (6,8) is currently enemy head. After movement, it will be free if enemy moves away. But if enemy moves to (7,8) and I move to (6,8), no collision. However, if I move to (6,8) and enemy moves to (6,8) (which it cannot because it is moving from (6,8)), so enemy cannot choose to stay. So moving to (6,8) is safe? But wait: rules say \"if another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\". But here, I am moving to (6,8) which is currently enemy head. After movement, enemy head is elsewhere. So (6,8) becomes free. So it should be safe.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle rule: \"if your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" But at the moment of movement, (6,8) is enemy head, which is part of its body. So if I move into it, I die. This is critical: the board state is before movement. So (6,8) is occupied by enemy snake #0's head (which is part of its body). Therefore, moving LEFT to (6,8) would be moving into another snake's body -> die.\n\nSo LEFT is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly:\n- RIGHT: (8,8) - within board, but my own body (unsafe).\n- UP: (7,9) - empty (safe).\n- DOWN: (7,7) - empty (safe).\n\nSo only safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nNow, consider next turn safety for each safe move:\n- If I move UP to (7,9): My new head at (7,9), body becomes [(7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (7,9): UP (7,10) - off board (unsafe), DOWN (7,8) - my body (unsafe), LEFT (6,9) - enemy body? Currently (6,9) is enemy body, but enemy will move. After enemy moves, (6,9) might be free? But careful: enemy body might remain. Actually, enemy snake #0 has body: [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7)]. After enemy moves, its tail might stay or grow? Since no apple eaten, enemy will move and its tail will move. So (6,9) might become free? But it depends on enemy move. However, it is risky to assume. Better to consider current state. Currently (6,9) is enemy body. So if I move to (7,9), next turn LEFT to (6,9) might be unsafe if enemy leaves its body there. Similarly, RIGHT (8,9) - empty? Currently empty. So from (7,9), safe moves might be only RIGHT? But wait, DOWN is my body. So only RIGHT is safe? Actually, we must check after movement. But to be conservative, assume enemy body remains. So from (7,9), only RIGHT (8,9) is safe? That gives 1 safe move next turn.\n- If I move DOWN to (7,7): My new head at (7,7), body becomes [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)] (no apple eaten). Next moves from (7,7): UP (7,8) - my body (unsafe), DOWN (7,6) - empty (safe), LEFT (6,7) - empty? Currently empty, but enemy is nearby. RIGHT (8,7) - my body (unsafe). So safe moves: DOWN (7,6) and possibly LEFT (6,7) if no enemy. So 2 safe moves.\n\nSo DOWN gives more options (2 safe moves) than UP (only 1 safe move).\n\nNow, which direction gets me closer to apples?\n- Moving UP to (7,9): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-9|=2+2=4 moves), (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-9|=1+7=8 moves), etc.\n- Moving DOWN to (7,7): Closest apples: (9,7) (|9-7|+|7-7|=2+0=2 moves), (8,2) (|8-7|+|2-7|=1+5=6 moves), etc.\n\nDOWN is much closer to (9,7).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,8). It can move: UP (6,9) - its body (unsafe), DOWN (6,7) - empty, LEFT (5,8) - empty, RIGHT (7,8) - my current head (but I will move). So enemy safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. It might go DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). If enemy goes DOWN to (6,7), it might compete for (9,7).\n\nSo I should move DOWN to (7,7) to get closer to (9,7). From (7,7), I can then go RIGHT to (8,7) (which has an apple) or DOWN to (7,6) to approach.\n\nLong-term: I need to eat apples to win. (9,7) is very close. Also, (8,2) is below.\n\nPrioritize DOWN for safety and apple proximity.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP and DOWN. DOWN provides 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN to (7,6) and LEFT to (6,7)), while UP only provides 1 (RIGHT to (8,9)). DOWN moves to (7,7) which is closer to apple at (9,7) (2 moves away). Enemy at (6,8) may move DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). Moving DOWN avoids immediate conflict and positions for (9,7). Next turn, from (7,7), I can go RIGHT to (8,7) to eat the apple or DOWN to (7,6) for safety.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

So moving LEFT to (6,7) would indeed kill me. Similarly, UP and RIGHT are my own body. So only DOWN is safe.\n\nTherefore, I must choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:** \nAfter moving DOWN to (7,6), my new head will be at (7,6). My body will become: [(7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)] (no apple eaten, so length remains 7). \nFrom (7,6), I can plan to go towards the apple at (9,7) or (8,2). However, enemy snake #0 is at (6,7) and might compete for (9,7). Next turn, I should avoid head-on collisions and try to reach apples safely. Since I have only one safe move this turn, I must take it and reassess next turn.\n\n**Note for future self:** \nOnly DOWN was safe this turn. Next turn, from (7,6), check moves: UP (7,7) is my body, DOWN (7,5) is empty, LEFT (6,6) is empty, RIGHT (8,6) is my body. So safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. Apple at (9,7) is to the right and up, but RIGHT is blocked by my body. So I may need to go DOWN or LEFT to avoid trapping myself and then circle around. Alternatively, apple at (8,2) is below. Consider moving DOWN to (7,5) to approach (8,2). Enemy is at (6,7) and may move towards (9,7) or down. Be cautious of head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

I have 6 apples.\n- Apples at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (0,3)\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (6,6), body: [(6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)] (length 6 segments). It has 5 apples.\n\n**Possible moves from (7,6): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\nCheck immediate safety (avoid off-board, own body, enemy body):\n- UP: (7,7) - my own body (unsafe).\n- DOWN: (7,5) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- LEFT: (6,6) - within board, currently enemy head (snake #0). Moving into enemy head would cause a head-on collision? But note: enemy head is at (6,6). If I move LEFT to (6,6) and enemy moves into (6,6) as well (e.g., if it moves RIGHT from (6,6)), we both die. However, if enemy moves away, I might survive? But rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" Since (6,6) is currently occupied by enemy head (part of its body), moving LEFT would kill me regardless of what enemy does. So LEFT is unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - my own body (unsafe).\n\nSo only safe move: DOWN to (7,5).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (7,5), my new head will be at (7,5). My body becomes: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)] (no apple eaten, so length remains 7). \nFrom (7,5), I can plan to go towards the apple at (8,2) which is below and left. Alternatively, apple at (9,7) is above and right but currently blocked by my body. Enemy snake #0 is at (6,6) and might move towards (9,7) or down. Next turn, from (7,5), safe moves will likely be DOWN (to (7,4)) or LEFT (to (6,5)) or RIGHT (to (8,5))? Check: RIGHT (8,5) is currently my tail? Actually, my tail is at (8,5) now, but after moving DOWN, my tail will move? Since no apple eaten, the tail moves: the last segment (8,5) will be removed. So (8,5) becomes free. Therefore, next turn, from (7,5):\n- UP: (7,6) is my body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (7,4) empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (6,5) empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (8,5) empty (safe) because tail moved away.\n\nSo I will have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I should consider moving towards the apple at (8,2) via DOWN and LEFT. Alternatively, apple at (1,1) is far left and down, but enemy might be competing. Avoid head-on collisions with enemy at (6,6). Enemy might move RIGHT to (7,6) or DOWN to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,6) or UP to (6,7). If enemy moves DOWN to (6,5), that would be where I might go LEFT to (6,5) next turn? So be cautious.\n\nFor now, only DOWN is safe this turn. I must take it.\n\nDOWN",

It has 5 apples.\n\n**Possible moves from (7,5): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\nCheck immediate safety (avoid off-board, own body, enemy body):\n- UP: (7,6) - my own body (unsafe).\n- DOWN: (7,4) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- LEFT: (6,5) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (8,5) - within board, currently empty (safe).\n\nSo all three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should aim for the nearest apple at (8,2) which is below and right. Moving DOWN to (7,4) or RIGHT to (8,5) both get me closer. However, moving RIGHT to (8,5) is directly towards (8,2) via a downward path later. Also, note that my body is blocking the path to (9,7) above, so that apple is less accessible. The apple at (1,1) is far left and down, but enemy snake #0 is near that area? Enemy head at (5,6) might also go for (8,2) or (1,1). I should avoid head-on collisions.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,6) can move UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), or RIGHT (6,6). Note that (6,6) is its own body (first segment), so RIGHT is unsafe for it. So enemy likely moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,5), I am moving away from enemy and towards (8,2). Then next turn from (8,5), I can go DOWN to (8,4) and then further down to (8,2). Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,4) also gets me closer to (8,2) but requires a right move later.\n\nI should also consider future safe moves. From (7,4), I can go DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), or RIGHT to (8,4). All should be safe if no enemy interferes. Similarly, from (8,5), I can go UP (8,6) but that is my body? After this move, my body will shift: head moves to new position, tail moves away. So (8,6) is currently my body, but after moving RIGHT to (8,5), my tail (currently at (8,6)) will be removed? Actually, no apple eaten, so the tail moves: the last segment (8,6) is removed. So (8,6) becomes free. Therefore, from (8,5), next turn:\n- UP: (8,6) - free (safe)\n- DOWN: (8,4) - free (safe)\n- LEFT: (7,5) - free (safe) but note that was my previous head? Actually, after moving, my body becomes [(8,5), (7,5), (7,6), ...] so (7,5) is my neck, so it is unsafe to go back LEFT to (7,5) because it is my own body. So LEFT would be unsafe next turn.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - free (safe)\n\nSo from (8,5), safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (7,4), my body becomes [(7,4), (7,5), (7,6), ...]. Then from (7,4):\n- UP: (7,5) - my neck (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (7,3) - free (safe)\n- LEFT: (6,4) - free (safe)\n- RIGHT: (8,4) - free (safe)\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,5) is safe now, but it moves me towards enemy. Enemy might move DOWN to (5,5) or LEFT to (4,6), so (6,5) might be safe. But it doesn't get me closer to any apple quickly. Apple at (1,1) is far, and enemy might be going there.\n\nBest to go for (8,2). So RIGHT to (8,5) is good, as it gets me closer and has safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Alternatively, DOWN to (7,4) also has safe follow-ups and is closer to (8,2) in the long run? Actually, (8,2) is at x=8, y=2. From (7,5), moving RIGHT to (8,5) puts me at same x as apple, but higher y. Then I need to go down. Moving DOWN to (7,4) puts me at lower y, but same x as current. Then I need to go right and down.\n\nBoth are reasonable. But moving RIGHT to (8,5) has the advantage of being further from enemy (enemy at (5,6)) and directly aligning with the apple's x-coordinate.\n\nI choose RIGHT to (8,5).\n\n**Final move:**\nRIGHT",

I have 6 apples.\n- Apples at: (9,7), (9,0), (8,2), (1,1), (0,3)\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (4,6), body: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9)] (length 6 segments). It has 5 apples.\n\n**Possible moves from (8,5): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\nCheck immediate safety (avoid off-board, own body, enemy body):\n- UP: (8,6) - currently my body? In the body list: (8,7) and (8,8) are present, but (8,6) is not listed. Actually, my body is [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7)] - so (8,6) is not occupied. However, note that after moving, my tail will shift since no apple eaten. So UP to (8,6) is safe (free).\n- DOWN: (8,4) - within board, free (safe).\n- LEFT: (7,5) - my own body (first segment after head) - unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - within board, free (safe).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should aim for the nearest apple at (8,2) which is directly below me. Moving DOWN to (8,4) gets me closer. From there, I can continue DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2). This path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,7) is above and right. Moving UP to (8,6) and then RIGHT to (9,6) and UP to (9,7) is possible, but that might be risky because enemy snake #0 is at (4,6) and might also be moving towards that area? Actually, enemy is far away (head at (4,6)), so it might not reach quickly.\n\nHowever, the apple at (8,2) is very close and achievable in 2 moves (DOWN to (8,4), then DOWN to (8,3), then DOWN to (8,2) to eat). So prioritizing (8,2) is efficient.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately; it just moves me to the right edge. From there, I could go DOWN to (9,4) etc., but that is longer to (8,2) or (9,0).\n\nSo DOWN is best for the nearest apple.\n\nAlso, consider enemy movements: enemy head at (4,6) can move UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), or RIGHT (5,6) - but (5,6) is its own body (first segment), so RIGHT is unsafe. So enemy likely moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT. It might go for apple at (1,1) or (0,3), which are far from me. So no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN to (8,4) to get closer to (8,2).\n\n**Future plan:** Next turn, from (8,4), I can go DOWN to (8,3) (towards apple) or other safe directions. Avoid moving LEFT to (7,4) if it becomes unsafe due to body, but after moving DOWN, my body will be [(8,4), (8,5), (7,5), ...] so (7,4) is free. But I should prioritize DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

I have 7 apples.\n- Apples at: (9,7), (9,0), (1,1), (0,3), (4,8)\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2,5), body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)] (length 6 segments). It has 5 apples.\n\n**Possible moves from (8,2): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\nCheck immediate safety (avoid off-board, own body, enemy body):\n- UP: (8,3) - my own body (first segment after head) - unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,1) - within board, free (no snake body).\n- LEFT: (7,2) - within board, free (safe).\n- RIGHT: (9,2) - within board, free (safe).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI just ate an apple at (8,2) last turn, so now I have 7 apples and length 8. My body extends to include (8,2) as head and the old head (8,3) becomes the next segment.\n\nApples available: (9,7) is far up-right, (9,0) is far down-right, (1,1) is far down-left, (0,3) is left, (4,8) is up-left.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,5) with head at (2,5) and body going east. It might be heading towards the apples on the left (like (1,1) or (0,3)), but it's not an immediate threat to me.\n\nI should avoid moving UP into my own body at (8,3). So DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,1) gets me closer to (9,0) and (1,1). Moving RIGHT to (9,2) gets me closer to (9,0) and (9,7). Moving LEFT to (7,2) is safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\nI should consider future moves: if I go DOWN to (8,1), next turn I can go LEFT to (7,1) or RIGHT to (9,1) to approach (9,0). If I go RIGHT to (9,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,1) for (9,0) or UP to (9,3) to eventually reach (9,7). LEFT to (7,2) is safe but less direct.\n\nSince (9,0) is closer than (9,7), I should prioritize going down towards (9,0). Also, (1,1) is another option but requires going left.\n\nTo keep options open, DOWN or RIGHT are good. LEFT is safe but not as productive.\n\nI choose DOWN to (8,1) to move towards (9,0) and avoid any potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n**Future plan:** After moving to (8,1), next turn I can go RIGHT to (9,1) to get closer to (9,0) or LEFT to (7,1) to avoid the right edge. Avoid going UP back into my body at (8,2).\n\nDOWN",

Now I need to avoid moving UP into my own body at (8,2). The apples at (9,0) and (1,1) are nearby. (9,0) is directly to the right and down, while (1,1) is far left and down.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,0) gets me adjacent to (9,0) (since (8,0) and (9,0) are neighbors). Next turn I could go RIGHT to (9,0) to eat it. However, (8,0) is safe now.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,1) is also good because it gets me closer to (9,0) (next turn DOWN to (9,0)) and also towards (9,7) long-term.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7,1) is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple; it might be useful for avoiding potential conflicts or heading towards (1,1) eventually, but that's far.\n\nI should prioritize eating (9,0) quickly since it's very close. To do that, going DOWN to (8,0) or RIGHT to (9,1) both set me up to get it next turn. However, if I go DOWN to (8,0), I can only go RIGHT to (9,0) next turn (since UP is my body, LEFT is (7,0) which is safe but not helpful, DOWN is off-board). So only one safe follow-up.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,0) to eat the apple, or UP to (9,2) (which is safe) to continue towards (9,7), or LEFT to (8,1) (but that might be occupied by my body next turn? Actually, after moving RIGHT, my body will shift: head becomes (9,1), then (8,1), (8,2), etc. So (8,1) will be my body next turn, so LEFT from (9,1) to (8,1) would be unsafe. So from (9,1), safe moves would be UP to (9,2) and DOWN to (9,0). So two safe options.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (9,1) gives more flexibility: I can go DOWN to (9,0) to eat the apple or UP to (9,2) to avoid being trapped.\n\nGoing DOWN to (8,0) only allows RIGHT to (9,0) next turn, which is risky if something blocks (9,0) (but currently it's free).\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (2,4) and moving, but not an immediate threat to me.\n\nI should choose RIGHT to (9,1) to have more options next turn and be in position to get (9,0).\n\nLEFT to (7,1) is safe but less productive.\n\nSo I'll go RIGHT.\n\n**Future plan:** After moving to (9,1), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,0) to eat the apple or UP to (9,2) to avoid dead-end. Avoid going LEFT back to (8,1) which will be my body. If I eat (9,0), I'll grow and have more segments. Then I can consider going up towards (9,7) or other apples.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**Current board state:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (9,1), body: [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6)] (length 8 segments). I have 7 apples.\n- Apples at: (9,7), (9,0), (1,1), (0,3), (4,8)\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (1,4), body: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] (length 6 segments). It has 5 apples.\n\n**Possible moves from (9,1): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\nCheck immediate safety (avoid off-board, own body, enemy body):\n- UP: (9,2) - within board, free (safe).\n- DOWN: (9,0) - within board, has an apple! But also check: no snake body there (enemy snake is far away). So safe to move and eat.\n- LEFT: (8,1) - my own body (first segment after head) - unsafe.\n- RIGHT: off-board (x=10) - invalid.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI am at (9,1). There is an apple at (9,0) directly below me. Moving DOWN to (9,0) will let me eat it, growing to 9 segments (head at (9,0), then (9,1), (8,1), ...). This is highly beneficial.\n\nMoving UP to (9,2) is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately. However, it might be useful for heading towards (9,7) later.\n\nBut since DOWN is safe and gets an apple, I should prioritize that. Eating apples is key to winning.\n\nAlso, note that after eating (9,0), my head will be at (9,0). Next turn, from (9,0), I can only move UP (to (9,1)) which will be my body (since after eating, the tail doesn't move, so my body will be [(9,1), (8,1), ...]). So moving DOWN to (9,0) is safe this turn, but next turn I will have only one move: UP to (9,1) (which is safe because it's my body? Wait no: moving into your own body is always deadly. So if I go to (9,0) and then next turn only UP is available, but UP is (9,1) which is my body - that would kill me.\n\nWait, let's simulate:\n\nCurrent head: (9,1)\nBody: [(8,1), (8,2), ...]\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,0) and eat the apple:\nNew head: (9,0)\nNew body: (9,1) (the old head) + [(8,1), (8,2), ...] but since I ate, I grow, so the tail doesn't move. So new body: [ (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6) ] (length 9).\n\nNext turn, from head at (9,0):\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (9,1) - my own body (first segment) - unsafe.\n- DOWN: off-board - unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,0) - free? Currently, (8,0) is empty. But after my move, it should remain free.\n- RIGHT: off-board - unsafe.\n\nSo actually, from (9,0), only LEFT to (8,0) is safe. So I will have one safe move next turn.\n\nSo going DOWN to (9,0) is safe this turn, but leaves me with only one option next turn (LEFT to (8,0)).\n\nNow consider UP to (9,2):\nIf I move UP to (9,2):\nNew head: (9,2)\nNew body: (9,1) + [(8,1), (8,2), ...] but since no apple, the tail moves: so body becomes [ (9,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5) ] (length 8, same as before).\n\nFrom (9,2), next turn:\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (9,3) - free.\n- DOWN: (9,1) - my body (first segment) - unsafe.\n- LEFT: (8,2) - my body (second segment) - unsafe.\n- RIGHT: off-board - unsafe.\n\nSo only UP to (9,3) is safe. So also only one option.\n\nSo both moves lead to having only one safe move next turn. But DOWN gets an apple, which is good.\n\nMoreover, after going DOWN to (9,0) and then LEFT to (8,0), I can then have more options: from (8,0), I can go UP to (8,1) (which might be free by then? But my body will be at (9,1), etc.) or LEFT to (7,0), etc. It might open up.\n\nWhereas UP to (9,2) and then UP to (9,3) leads towards (9,7), but that's a long way.\n\nSo since both are safe and DOWN gets an apple, I should choose DOWN.\n\nAlso, the enemy is far away and not a threat.\n\nTherefore, I'll go DOWN to eat the apple at (9,0).\n\n**Future plan:** After eating (9,0), head at (9,0), only LEFT to (8,0) is safe next turn. Then from (8,0), I can assess. I should try to avoid getting trapped in the bottom-right corner. After (8,0), I might go LEFT to (7,0) or UP to (8,1) if it becomes free (but it will be my body for a while). Alternatively, I can consider going towards the apple at (1,1) or (0,3) later, but that requires moving left across the board.\n\nFor now, eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is still far away on the right, so I have breathing room.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** After moving RIGHT, I should continue toward (3, 1) to collect that apple. Then I'll need to assess whether to push further right toward (6, 3) or loop back to safer territory on the left. I should avoid getting trapped against the walls and maintain distance from snake #1.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is still at (6, 2) and doesn't appear to be threatening me immediately, so I have time to collect this apple safely.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** After collecting the apple at (3, 1), I'll need to assess the best path away from that position.

It has 7 apples.\n\nFrom head position (6,2), check moves:\n- UP: (6,3) - Contains an apple! Eating this would grow me to 11 segments and give me 10 apples. Safe to move into (no snake body).\n- DOWN: (6,1) - My own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nConsider each:\n- UP (6,3): Directly eats the apple at (6,3). This is highly beneficial - it increases my score to 10 and grows my length. After eating, my head will be at (6,3) and my tail will extend (since I grow), so the body will be longer. This move puts me closer to the apple at (4,8) and (9,7) for future planning.\n- LEFT (5,2): Moves away from the immediate apple. While it might be safe, it misses an opportunity to score and grow.\n- RIGHT (7,2): Also moves away from the apple. Not optimal.\n\nCheck enemy threats: Snake #0 is at (2,1). It is not an immediate threat to me at (6,2) or (6,3). Its possible moves are UP to (2,2) (safe), DOWN to (2,0) (safe), LEFT to (1,1) (its own body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (3,1) (contains apple at (3,1)). It will likely move RIGHT to eat the apple at (3,1), which is away from me.\n\nTherefore, UP is clearly the best move - it safely eats an apple, increases my score, and doesn't risk immediate conflict.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (6,3), I'll have 10 apples. Next, consider moving toward (4,8) or (9,7). (4,8) is closer and might be safer. Avoid moving left into enemy territory since snake #0 is likely to be around (3,1) after this turn.\n\nUP",

I have 10 apples.\n**Apples:** (9,7), (4,8), (3,9), (1,5), (2,6)\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (3,2), body: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)] (length 8 segments). It has 8 apples.\n\nFrom head position (6,4), check moves:\n- UP: (6,5) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- DOWN: (6,3) - My own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,4) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,4) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nConsider each:\n- UP (6,5): Moves toward the apples at (4,8) and (3,9). This is a good direction to continue my path upward. However, note that the board shows a 'T' at (6,6) (which is my body? Actually, grid shows '1' at (6,4) and 'T' at (6,3) etc. So (6,5) is empty). But looking ahead: after UP, I'll be at (6,5). Then possible moves from there: UP to (6,6) - which is currently empty? Wait, the grid shows at row 6: \". . A . . . . . . .\" so (6,6) is empty. Actually, the grid row labels: row 6 is y=6? The grid is labeled from top (y=9) to bottom (y=0). So row 6 is actually y=6? Let me clarify: the grid has:\n  Row 9: . . . A . . . . . .\n  Row 8: . . . . A . . . . .\n  Row 7: . . . . . . . . . A\n  Row 6: . . A . . . . . . .\n  Row 5: . A . . . . . . . .\n  Row 4: . T . . . . 1 . . .   -> so (6,4) is my head.\n  Row 3: T T . . . . T . . .\n  Row 2: T T . 0 . . T . T .\n  Row 1: . T T T . . T T T T\n  Row 0: . . . . . . . T T T\n\nSo coordinates: (x,y) with x from 0 to 9 (left to right), y from 0 to 9 (bottom to top). So row 0 is y=0, row 1 is y=1, etc.\n\nTherefore, (6,5) is in row 5? Actually, row 5 is labeled \"5 . A . . . . . . . .\" so (6,5) is empty? Wait, row 5 has x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: '.', ... so (6,5) is at x=6, y=5 -> which is in row 5? But row 5 is y=5? Actually, the grid rows are labeled with y coordinate. So row 4 is y=4, row 5 is y=5, etc.\n\nSo (6,5) is currently empty ('.' in row 5, column 6). Similarly, (6,6) is in row 6: \". . A . . . . . . .\" so (6,6) is empty (it's the third column, which has 'A' at (2,6)? Actually, row 6: x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: 'A', x=3: '.', ... so (6,6) is '.').\n\nSo UP is safe and leads to open space.\n\n- LEFT (5,4): Moves left. This is also safe. But it moves away from the apples in the top-right and top-left. The apples are at (9,7), (4,8), (3,9), (1,5), (2,6). So moving left might get me closer to (1,5) and (2,6)? Actually, (1,5) is at left-top, and (2,6) is also left. But I am at (6,4), so LEFT to (5,4) is not directly toward them. Also, there is an apple at (4,8) which is above-left.\n\n- RIGHT (7,4): Moves right. This is safe. But my body is at (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), etc. So moving right might lead to tighter spaces later.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,2). It is not an immediate threat. It might move UP to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,2) or LEFT to (2,2) or DOWN to (3,1) (but (3,1) is its body). So likely UP or RIGHT.\n\nLong-term: I should aim for the apples at (4,8) and (3,9) as they are multiple and in the same direction. Moving UP continues my upward trajectory and keeps options open. LEFT might be acceptable but not as direct. RIGHT is less favorable due to my body on the right.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to progress toward the apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nConsider each:\n- UP (6,7): Moves toward the apples at (4,8) and (3,9). This continues my upward path and keeps me in open space. From (6,7), I can later go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT to access apples. This is a strong move.\n- LEFT (5,6): Moves toward the apples at (4,8), (3,9), (1,5), and (2,6). However, it moves me closer to the enemy snake #0 (which is at (2,3)) and might lead to tighter spaces on the left side. Also, my body is below me, so moving left might reduce future options.\n- RIGHT (7,6): Moves toward the apple at (9,7) but away from the other apples. My body is on the right (e.g., (7,1), (7,0)), so moving right might lead to dead-ends later. Less favorable.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,3). It might move UP to (2,4), RIGHT to (3,3) (empty?), LEFT to (1,3) (empty?), or DOWN to (2,2) (its own body). So likely UP, LEFT, or RIGHT are safe for it.

Moving UP is the most direct way to get there while maintaining flexibility. LEFT might be acceptable but risks encounters with the enemy. UP is the best choice.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving upward to target (4,8) and (3,9). Avoid moving left too early to prevent potential conflict with snake #0.

Also keeps the top row open.\n- DOWN (3,8): Moves toward the apple at (4,4) and potentially (8,6) or (9,7). However, my body is below me at (3,8) is currently empty, but moving down might lead into a more crowded area with my body trail.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0,3). It might move UP to (0,4) (empty), DOWN to (0,2) (empty), RIGHT to (1,3) (its own body). So it will likely go UP or DOWN. This doesn't conflict with my moves.\n\nLong-term strategy: I have a lead (12 vs 10 apples). I should prioritize safety and collecting apples without taking risks. The apple at (2,6) is relatively close and reachable. The apple at (4,4) is also nearby but requires navigating through my body trail. The apples at (8,6) and (9,7) are farther but valuable.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,9) is good because:\n- It moves toward (2,6) apple.\n- From (2,9), next moves could be DOWN to (2,8) (empty) or LEFT to (1,9) (empty) to avoid my body.\n- It avoids going down into my body trail immediately.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3,8) is also safe, but:\n- It moves into an area with more body segments nearby (e.g., (4,8), (5,8), etc.).\n- It might lead to fewer options later.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the better choice to maintain flexibility and move toward an apple.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (2,9), consider moving DOWN to (2,8) to approach the (2,6) apple. Avoid moving right back into my body. Also, watch for enemy snake #0 which might be moving toward (1,0) apple.\n\nLEFT",

After collecting, I'll have options from (1, 0): UP back to (1, 1), RIGHT to (2, 0), or if needed LEFT to (0, 0).\n- **RIGHT to (2, 1)**: Moves toward the center and closer to apples at (4, 4) and (2, 6), but doesn't collect anything this turn.\n- **UP to (1, 2)**: Moves away from the closest apple, not optimal.\n\n**CLOSEST APPLES:**\n- (1, 0): 1 move away - RIGHT HERE!\n- (4, 4): 5 moves away\n- (2, 6): 7 moves away\n\n**BEST MOVE:** DOWN to (1, 0). This is clearly optimal because:\n1. It collects an apple immediately (reducing the gap with snake #1 to just 1 apple)\n2. It's completely safe (no collision risk)\n3. It keeps me in a good position with multiple escape routes from (1, 0)\n4. The apple is right there - I shouldn't pass up free points!\n\n**FUTURE PLANNING:** After collecting (1, 0), I'll be at 11 apples vs snake #1's 12. I should then target (4, 4) to catch up and potentially overtake the enemy. I need to stay aware of my growing body length and avoid getting trapped.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,6) - Apple! Safe to move there (will eat apple and grow).\n- LEFT: (1,7) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,7) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- DOWN (2,6): This moves directly onto the apple at (2,6). This is highly advantageous - I get an apple, grow to length 14, and increase my lead to 13 vs 10. After eating, my head will be at (2,6) and my tail will extend (since I grow), so the body will be longer but the tail remains at (6,3) for now.\n- LEFT (1,7): Moves away from the apple. From (1,7), I could go DOWN to (1,6) or LEFT to (0,7), but this delays getting the apple.\n- RIGHT (3,7): Moves away from the apple. From (3,7), I could go DOWN to (3,6) or RIGHT to (4,7), but again, not toward the apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1,1). It might move UP to (1,2) (empty), DOWN to (1,0) (apple at (1,0)), LEFT to (0,1) (its own body), or RIGHT to (2,1) (empty). It will likely go DOWN to (1,0) to eat the apple there. This doesn't conflict with my DOWN move to (2,6).\n\nLong-term: After eating the apple at (2,6), I should consider next moves. From (2,6), I can go DOWN to (2,5) (enemy body? - snake #0 has segment at (2,5)), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). So DOWN is blocked by enemy body. I should plan to go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the enemy snake and then head toward other apples like (4,4) or (8,6). But first, prioritize getting this apple.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2,6) is the best move - it directly collects an apple and increases my score. It is safe and efficient.\n\nPlan for next turns: After eating the apple at (2,6), avoid moving DOWN into enemy body at (2,5). Consider LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6) to move toward the center and then toward (4,4) or (8,6). Watch out for enemy snake #0 which will be at (1,0) if it moves DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,5) - Enemy snake #0 body segment (at (2,5)). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (1,6) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,6) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nOnly safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- LEFT (1,6): Moves toward the left side. From (1,6), I can go UP to (1,7) (empty), DOWN to (1,5) (enemy body? - snake #0 has segment at (1,5)), or LEFT to (0,6) (empty). So UP and LEFT are safe next moves. Also, there is an apple at (1,8) which is close (UP then UP then LEFT?).\n- RIGHT (3,6): Moves toward the center. From (3,6), I can go UP to (3,7) (empty), DOWN to (3,5) (empty), or RIGHT to (4,6) (apple at (4,6)). So RIGHT leads directly to an apple in two moves (RIGHT then RIGHT to (4,6)).\n\nRIGHT is very attractive because it sets me up to eat the apple at (4,6) next turn (if I move RIGHT to (3,6) now, then RIGHT again to (4,6) next turn). Also, there is another apple at (4,4) nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1,0). It might move UP to (1,1) (its own body), DOWN is off board (1,-1) so invalid, LEFT to (0,0) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,0) (empty). So it will likely go LEFT or RIGHT. It doesn't threaten me immediately.\n\nLong-term: After moving RIGHT to (3,6), I plan to move RIGHT again to (4,6) to eat that apple. Then from (4,6), I can go DOWN to (4,5) (empty) or LEFT to (3,6) (my body? but will have moved) or RIGHT to (5,6) (empty). So I can continue toward (4,4) or (8,6).\n\nLEFT (1,6) is also safe, but it doesn't lead directly to an apple as quickly. The apple at (1,8) is two moves away (UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8)), but that might be riskier due to proximity to enemy? Actually enemy is far away.\n\nBut RIGHT is better because it gets me closer to two apples (4,6) and (4,4) and also toward (8,6). It also keeps me in the center with more options.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (3,6) this turn. Next turn, move RIGHT to (4,6) to eat the apple. Then consider DOWN to (4,5) or continue RIGHT to (5,6) to head toward (8,6). Avoid enemy snake #0 which is on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (3,5) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,6) - My own body segment (second segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) - Apple at (4,6)! If I move here, I'll eat the apple and grow.\n\nRIGHT leads directly to an apple, which is highly desirable. However, I must check if it's safe:\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,6) is safe because it's an apple (not a body segment). After eating, my head will be at (4,6) and I'll grow by 1.\n\nNow check other moves:\nUP (3,7) and DOWN (3,5) are also safe, but RIGHT gets me an apple immediately.\n\nWhat about enemy threats?\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,0). It can move:\n- UP: (2,1) - empty\n- DOWN: (2,-1) - off board (invalid)\n- LEFT: (1,0) - its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (3,0) - empty\n\nSo enemy will likely move UP or RIGHT. It is far away from me (bottom left) and poses no immediate threat to my position.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move: it gets me an apple and increases my score to 14.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (4,6) and eating the apple:\n- My new head will be at (4,6)\n- My body will grow: the tail doesn't move, so the new body will be: [current head (3,6) becomes new second segment, followed by the rest...] so body: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,7), ... , (6,4)] plus the old tail remains (since we grew) - total length 14+1=15.\n\nFrom (4,6) next turn, I can consider:\n- UP: (4,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (4,5) - empty\n- LEFT: (3,6) - my body (will be the new second segment) - unsafe\n- RIGHT: (5,6) - empty\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe. I can head toward the apple at (4,4) (DOWN then DOWN) or (8,6) (RIGHT multiple times) or (9,7) (UP and RIGHT).\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (4,6). Next turn, from (4,6), I should avoid LEFT (into my body). Consider DOWN to (4,5) to approach (4,4) apple, or RIGHT to (5,6) to approach (8,6), or UP to (4,7) for more space.\n\nRIGHT",

The tail is at (6,5).\n\nApples at: (9,7), (8,6), (4,4), (1,8), (6,9)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (4,0), body: [(3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nCheck moves from my head (4,5):\n- UP: (4,6) - My own body segment (second segment). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (4,4) - Apple! Safe to move there (eating apple grows me).\n- LEFT: (3,5) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (5,5) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nUP is unsafe because it moves into my body at (4,6). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (4,4) is directly below me: DOWN would get me there immediately.\n- (8,6) is to the right-right-up: RIGHT twice then UP.\n- (9,7) is far right-up: RIGHT five times then UP twice.\n- (1,8) is left-up: LEFT twice then UP three times.\n- (6,9) is right-up: RIGHT twice then UP four times.\n\nThe closest apple is (4,4) at distance 1. Moving DOWN eats it immediately.\n\nCheck enemy threats:\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,0). It can move:\n- UP: (4,1) - empty\n- DOWN: (4,-1) - off board (invalid)\n- LEFT: (3,0) - its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (5,0) - empty\n\nSo enemy will likely move UP or RIGHT. It is far away from me (bottom) and poses no immediate threat to my position.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves:\n- DOWN (4,4): Eats apple immediately. After eating, my head will be at (4,4) and I'll grow by 1 segment. From there, I can go LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4), or UP to (4,5) (but (4,5) will be occupied by my new body segment next turn, so UP becomes unsafe). So only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT and RIGHT).\n- LEFT (3,5): Moves away from apples. From there, I can go UP to (3,6) (my body, unsafe), DOWN to (3,4), or LEFT to (2,5). So 2 safe moves.\n- RIGHT (5,5): Moves toward (8,6) and (6,9). From there, I can go UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), or RIGHT to (6,5) (my tail, but tail will move away when I don't eat an apple). Since I'm not eating this turn, my tail at (6,5) will move forward, making (6,5) empty next turn. So all 3 directions might be safe next turn.\n\nHowever, eating the apple at (4,4) is highly beneficial - it gives me a point and extends my lead. Even though it reduces my immediate options next turn, I can plan accordingly.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (4,4), I'll be at (4,4) with my body extending. I should then move LEFT to (3,4) or RIGHT to (5,4) to avoid getting trapped. From there, I can work my way toward other apples like (8,6) or (6,9).\n\nDOWN is the best move: it secures an apple and increases my score advantage. The risk is minimal since the enemy is far away.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake is positioned at (4, 5) and above, so I need to be cautious about moving too close to their territory, but (4, 4) should still be safe to reach\n5. RIGHT would take me further away from the nearest apple\n\n**FUTURE PLANNING:** From (4, 1), I should continue UP toward (4, 2), (4, 3), and then (4, 4) to collect the apple. I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (4, 5) and avoid moving too close to their head. After collecting the apple at (4, 4), I should consider moving toward other apples like (1, 8) or (8, 6) depending on enemy positions.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (5,3) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,4) - My own body segment (second segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,4) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nLEFT is unsafe because it moves into my body at (4,4). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (8,6) is to the right-up: RIGHT three times then UP two times.\n- (6,9) is right-up: RIGHT one time then UP five times.\n- (9,7) is far right-up: RIGHT four times then UP three times.\n- (1,8) is left-up: LEFT four times then UP four times.\n- (0,9) is far left-up: LEFT five times then UP five times.\n\nThe closest apples are (6,9) and (8,6) in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\nCheck enemy threats:\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,1). It can move:\n- UP: (3,2) - empty\n- DOWN: (3,0) - its own body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (2,1) - empty\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - its own body (unsafe)\n\nSo enemy can only move UP or LEFT. It is likely to move UP to continue its upward path.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves:\n- UP (5,5): Moves toward (6,9) and (8,6). From there, I can go UP to (5,6) (empty), RIGHT to (6,5) (empty), or LEFT to (4,5) (my body - unsafe). So 2 safe moves next turn.\n- DOWN (5,3): Moves away from apples. From there, I can go DOWN to (5,2) (empty), LEFT to (4,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (6,3) (empty). So 3 safe moves next turn.\n- RIGHT (6,4): Moves toward (8,6) and (6,9). From there, I can go UP to (6,5) (empty), RIGHT to (7,4) (empty), or DOWN to (6,3) (empty). So 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nUP is less favorable because it reduces my options next turn (only 2 safe moves). RIGHT and DOWN both give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nRIGHT moves me directly toward the cluster of apples while maintaining good options. DOWN moves me away from apples and might lead to a dead-end long-term.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving rightward to target (6,9) and (8,6). Be cautious of enemy #0 moving upward - it might try to intercept me near the top-right. Avoid moving left into my body until my tail progresses.\n\nRIGHT",

It will likely move UP toward the (1,8) apple.\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- UP (6,9): Collects apple immediately. After eating, my head will be at (6,9) and I'll grow by one segment. Next turn options: LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9), DOWN (6,8) - but (6,8) will be occupied by my new body segment? Actually, after eating, my body extends - the tail doesn't move, so the cell behind me becomes body. So next turn from (6,9): LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9), DOWN (6,8) - but (6,8) will be my body (current head position). So DOWN would be unsafe next turn, leaving LEFT and RIGHT as options. Still good.\n- LEFT (5,8): Moves away from apples. Next moves: UP (5,9) empty, LEFT (4,8) empty, DOWN (5,7) empty. Three safe options.\n- RIGHT (7,8): Moves toward (8,6) and (9,7) apples. Next moves: UP (7,9) empty, RIGHT (8,8) empty, DOWN (7,7) empty. Three safe options.\n\nUP is clearly optimal - it collects an apple immediately and brings me closer to 30. Even though it reduces next turn's options slightly, the immediate gain outweighs this. LEFT and RIGHT are safe but don't collect apples.\n\nLong-term plan: After collecting (6,9), move RIGHT toward (8,6) and (9,7) apples. Monitor enemy #0 - it's moving north toward (1,8) but still distant.\n\nUP",

Wait, let's reconstruct properly.\n\nFrom the game state:\n- Head: (6,9)\n- Body: [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9)]\n\nSo I have 16 body segments plus head = 17 total length (since I collected 16 apples).\n\nApples at: (9,7), (8,6), (1,8), (0,9), (0,5)\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (1,5), body: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0)]\n\nCheck moves from my head (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) - off the board (y=10 invalid). Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (6,8) - My own body segment (first body segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (5,9) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) - Currently empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nOnly LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1,5). It can move:\n- UP: (1,6) - empty\n- DOWN: (1,4) - its own body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (0,5) - Apple at (0,5) - eating would grow it\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - empty\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It will likely move LEFT to eat the (0,5) apple.\n\nEvaluate my safe moves:\n- LEFT (5,9): Moves toward center. Next moves: LEFT (4,9) - my body (unsafe), UP (5,10) off board (unsafe), DOWN (5,8) empty, RIGHT (6,9) my head position (unsafe). So only DOWN would be safe next turn - very limiting.\n- RIGHT (7,9): Moves toward (8,6) and (9,7) apples. Next moves: UP (7,10) off board (unsafe), DOWN (7,8) empty, LEFT (6,9) my body (unsafe), RIGHT (8,9) empty. So DOWN and RIGHT would be safe next turn - better options.\n\nRIGHT is clearly better as it keeps more options open and moves toward apples. LEFT leads to a potential trap with only one safe move next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT toward the (8,6) and (9,7) apples. After RIGHT to (7,9), next turn I can go DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9). I should avoid going DOWN immediately as that might lead to limited options. The enemy is moving toward (0,5) apple and then likely toward (1,8) apple, which is far from me.\n\nRIGHT",

It can move:\n- UP: (0,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (0,5) - its own body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (-1,6) - off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,6) - empty\n\nSo enemy has two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. It will likely move UP toward (0,9) apple or RIGHT toward center.\n\nEvaluate my safe moves:\n- DOWN (7,7): Moves toward (8,6) apple. Next moves: UP (7,8) my head position (unsafe), DOWN (7,6) empty, LEFT (6,7) my body (unsafe), RIGHT (8,7) empty.

RIGHT gives me more future options (3 safe moves next turn vs 2 for DOWN). The (9,7) apple is closer than (8,6) - just two moves away with RIGHT then DOWN. The enemy is moving away from these apples, so I can safely pursue them.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (8,8) to approach the (9,7) apple.

Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (8,4) - Empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,5) - Empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - Empty ('.' in grid). Safe.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0,8). It can move:\n- UP: (0,9) - Apple position (safe)\n- DOWN: (0,7) - Empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (-1,8) - Off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - Its own body (unsafe)\n\nSo enemy has two safe moves: UP and DOWN. It will likely move UP to eat the (0,9) apple.\n\nEvaluate my safe moves:\n- DOWN (8,4): Next moves: UP (8,5) my head position (unsafe), DOWN (8,3) empty, LEFT (7,4) empty, RIGHT (9,4) empty. So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe next turn - good options.\n- LEFT (7,5): Next moves: UP (7,6) empty, DOWN (7,4) empty, LEFT (6,5) my body (unsafe), RIGHT (8,5) my head position (unsafe). So UP and DOWN would be safe next turn - decent options.\n- RIGHT (9,5): Next moves: UP (9,6) empty, DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) my head position (unsafe), RIGHT (10,5) off board (unsafe). So UP and DOWN would be safe next turn - decent options.\n\nAll three moves are viable. DOWN gives the most future options (3 safe moves next turn). The apple at (8,2) is reachable via DOWN moves. The apple at (5,5) is accessible via LEFT/DOWN moves. The apple at (9,7) is reachable via RIGHT then UP.\n\nThe enemy is about to eat the (0,9) apple and will be growing. I should focus on collecting apples while maintaining flexibility. DOWN provides the best path to multiple apples while keeping options open.\n\nLong-term plan: After DOWN, consider moving toward (8,2) apple via DOWN/DOWN/LEFT or toward (5,5) via LEFT/DOWN. Maintain distance from enemy who will be growing on left side. The RIGHT path to (9,7) remains an option if needed.\n\nDOWN",

So UP and DOWN would be safe next turn - decent options.\n- RIGHT (9,4): Next moves: UP (9,5) empty, DOWN (9,3) empty, LEFT (8,4) my head position (unsafe), RIGHT (10,4) off board (unsafe). So UP and DOWN would be safe next turn - decent options.\n\nAll three moves are viable. DOWN gives the most future options (3 safe moves next turn) and moves me directly toward the apple at (8,2). The apple at (5,5) is accessible via LEFT/DOWN moves. The apple at (9,7) is reachable via RIGHT then UP.\n\nThe enemy is forced to move RIGHT to (1,9), away from most apples. I should capitalize on this by collecting apples while maintaining flexibility. DOWN provides the best immediate path to an apple while keeping multiple options open.\n\nLong-term plan: After DOWN to (8,3), next turn move DOWN to (8,2) to eat the apple. Then consider moving LEFT toward (5,5) apple or continuing DOWN to bottom area. The RIGHT path to (9,7) remains an option. Maintain distance from enemy who is moving rightward.\n\nDOWN",

So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe next turn - excellent options. Gets me closer to apple at (9,1).\n- LEFT (7,2): Next moves: UP (7,3) empty, DOWN (7,1) empty, LEFT (6,2) empty, RIGHT (8,2) my head position (unsafe). So UP, DOWN, LEFT would be safe next turn - decent options.\n- RIGHT (9,2): Next moves: UP (9,3) empty, DOWN (9,1) apple position, LEFT (8,2) my head position (unsafe), RIGHT (10,2) off board (unsafe). So UP and DOWN would be safe next turn - decent options.\n\nDOWN is the best move - it maintains maximum flexibility with 3 safe moves next turn, moves me toward the bottom area where there's less enemy presence, and positions me to potentially collect apple at (9,1) via RIGHT next turn. The enemy is moving north/east, so moving south/west keeps me away from potential conflicts.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (8,1), consider RIGHT to (9,1) to collect that apple, then continue moving down/left to avoid the enemy. The apple at (5,5) is also accessible but requires careful navigation through my body. Maintain distance from enemy #0 who is likely moving toward the top-right area.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (10,1) - Off board (unsafe)\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe moves.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,9). It can move:\n- UP: (4,10) - Off board (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (4,8) - Empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (3,9) - Its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - Empty (safe)\n\nSo enemy has two safe moves: DOWN to (4,8) or RIGHT to (5,9).\n\nEvaluate my safe moves:\n- UP (9,2): Next moves: UP (9,3) empty, DOWN (9,1) my head position (unsafe), LEFT (8,2) my body (unsafe), RIGHT (10,2) off board (unsafe). So only UP would be safe next turn - very limited.\n- DOWN (9,0): Next moves: UP (9,1) my head position (unsafe), DOWN (9,-1) off board (unsafe), LEFT (8,0) empty, RIGHT (10,0) off board (unsafe). So only LEFT would be safe next turn - very limited.\n\nBoth options are risky with only one safe move next turn. However, DOWN to (9,0) gives me LEFT (8,0) as the only option next turn, which might lead to more open spaces. UP to (9,2) only gives UP (9,3) next, which could lead toward the apple at (9,7) but is a narrow path.\n\nThe enemy is moving DOWN or RIGHT, staying in the top area. Moving DOWN to (9,0) keeps me farther from the enemy. From (9,0), moving LEFT to (8,0) would open up DOWN (8,-1) off board, UP (8,1) my body, RIGHT (9,0) my position, LEFT (7,0) empty - so only LEFT (7,0) would be safe. This is still very constrained.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally risky in terms of next moves, I should choose DOWN to (9,0) because it moves me away from the enemy and potentially toward the left side where there are apples at (0,1) and (6,2). Also, the enemy might move toward the right/top, reducing collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (9,0), next turn I must move LEFT to (8,0). From there, I'll need to carefully navigate leftward to avoid getting trapped while seeking apples at (6,2) and (0,1). The enemy is likely to continue moving in the top-right area, so staying low and left might be safer.\n\nDOWN",

This is the most direct path to the nearest apple. The top row appears clear with only my own tail potentially in the future, but I have plenty of room before encountering it.\n\nFrom (4, 8), I would be moving away from the apple at (9, 7) and into an area with my body segments nearby at (1, 8), which could limit future mobility. While there's an apple at (7, 7) below, it's in territory occupied by the enemy snake's body.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 1), having likely just eaten the apple there (gaining their 19th apple). They're positioned well for the apple at (6, 2) now. We're not in immediate collision danger - they're on the bottom half of the board, I'm on the top.\n\nContinuing RIGHT to (5, 9) maintains my trajectory toward the apple at (9, 7) and provides good future mobility. I can continue RIGHT along the top or turn DOWN when needed. This move maximizes my chance of safely eating the nearest apple while keeping options open.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:** Continue RIGHT along top row toward (9, 7), then assess if I need to go DOWN to reach the apple or continue to maintain position advantage.\n\nRIGHT",
