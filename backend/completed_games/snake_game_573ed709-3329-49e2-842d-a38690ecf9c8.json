If I move up, I could potentially reach the apple at (7, 9), but that would also bring me closer to the enemy snake. Moving down might put me in a more defensive position, but I would miss out on the available apples.\n\nI think the best strategy here is to try to collect as many apples as possible while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. The apple at (6, 1) seems like a good target, as it's relatively isolated and moving towards it would put some distance between me and the enemy.\n\nTherefore, my next move will be DOWN."
