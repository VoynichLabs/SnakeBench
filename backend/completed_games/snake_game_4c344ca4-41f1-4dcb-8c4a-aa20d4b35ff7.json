(But the info says current position is (2, 5), and last move was LEFT, which suggests our previous position was (3, 5).)\n\nAssuming we are currently at (2, 5) after our last move, and the move was LEFT, then we would have moved from (3, 5) to (2, 5). But the data states our last move was LEFT, and our position is (2, 5). That implies our previous position was (3, 5). \n\nBut earlier, the description states our snake was at (1, 5), and the last move was LEFT, meaning we moved from (2, 5) to (1, 5). There seems to be a discrepancy, but to proceed, I will assume that our current position is (1, 5), after moving Left from (2, 5).\n\nOur goal is to reach an apple at (1, 7). To get to that apple:\n\n- From (1, 5), moving UP twice (+0,+1) twice will reach (1,7).\n\nCheck immediate threats:\n\n- Moving UP from (1,5) to (1,6), then to (1,7). Are those positions safe?\n\n- (1,6): is it occupied? No obstacle is indicated there.  \n- (1,7): there is an apple at (1,7).\n\n- No walls or enemies blocking the way upward.\n\n- Moving left or right would divert us from the target.\n\n- Moving down would take us away.\n\nSince the next move is to approach the apple at (1,7), moving UP seems optimal, especially after the previous LEFT move, as it continues towards that apple.\n\nNow, considering safety:\n\n- (1,6): unoccupied, safe to move.\n\n- Next, to reach (1,7), moving UP again from (1,6) to (1,7), where the apple is.\n\n- The only potential hazard is if moving UP to (1,6) puts us into the enemy's position at (0,6). Our current position is (1,5), moving UP would be to (1,6), which is open.\n\nThus, the sequence would be:\n\n1. UP to (1,6) - safe.\n\n2. UP again to (1,7) - to eat the apple.\n\nNext move will be UP.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the best current move is to move UP.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\n**Decided move: UP**",
