However, I'm not sure if I want to take that risk since I'm not sure what the enemy snakes are doing.\n\nAnother option is to move down to (5, 0) which is an apple, but I'd have to move right first to get there. This seems like a safer option, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get to it before the enemy snakes do.\n\nI also notice that there's an apple at (4, 7) which is relatively close to my current position, but I'd have to move up to get there. This seems like a good option since I'm not taking a huge risk.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to one of the apples without taking too much risk. I'll choose the option that seems the safest and most likely to get me a point.\n\nMy decided next move is: DOWN"
