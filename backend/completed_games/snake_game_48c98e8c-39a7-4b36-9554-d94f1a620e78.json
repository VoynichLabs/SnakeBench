Moving up would put me in a good position to go for that apple.\n\nHowever, I also need to be mindful of the enemy snake at (9, 3). I don't want to move in a way that would put me in danger of colliding with the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to prioritize moving towards the apple at (7, 7), but also maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake. I'll move UP to get closer to the (7, 7) apple while keeping some space between myself and the enemy.\n\nNext turn, I'll reassess the situation and decide whether to continue moving towards the (7, 7) apple or explore other options.\n\nMy move for this turn: UP"
