The board is 10x10.\nAvailable apples are at (7, 9), (6, 8), (0, 9), (5, 1), (1, 6).\n\nMy possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. **Check for deadly moves:**\n   * **UP (0, 5):** Safe. Inside bounds. No self-body to hit (length 1). Not where Snake 0 is (0, 1).\n   * **DOWN (0, 3):** Safe. Inside bounds. No self-body. Not where Snake 0 is.\n   * **LEFT (-1, 4):** Deadly. Off board (x < 0).\n   * **RIGHT (1, 4):** Safe. Inside bounds. No self-body. Not where Snake 0 is.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves based on proximity to apples and enemy position:**\n\nApples nearby in Y dimension: (0, 9) is 5 UP. (1, 6) is 2 UP and 1 RIGHT. (5, 1) is 3 DOWN and 5 RIGHT.\n\n*   **Snake 0 Position:** (0, 1). If Snake 0 moves UP, it will be at (0, 2). If it moves DOWN, it hits the wall and DIES.\n\n*   **UP (0, 5):** Moves me closer to (0, 9) (4 away) and (1, 6) (1 away in X, 1 away in Y). This maintains the wall safety on the left. If Snake 0 moves UP twice, it will reach (0, 3). Moving UP seems good for reaching the top left apples.\n\n*   **DOWN (0, 3):** Moves me closer to (5, 1) but far from (0, 9) and (1, 6). If Snake 0 moves UP, it might block me or cause a collision if I continue down the left wall.\n\n*   **RIGHT (1, 4):** Moves me away from the wall, opening up more space. Closer to (1, 6) (2 away in Y) and (5, 1).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nMy primary goal is to get apples while minimizing risk.\n\n1.  **Chasing (0, 9) or (1, 6):** These are the closest apples.\n    *   (0, 9) is 5 UP.\n    *   (1, 6) is 1 RIGHT and 2 UP.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 5):\n    *   I'm 4 steps from (0, 9).\n    *   I'm 1 step away in X and 1 step away in Y from (1, 6).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 4):\n    *   I'm 2 steps away in Y from (1, 6).\n    *   I'm 5 steps away in X and 5 steps away in Y from (0, 9).\n\nMoving UP seems strategically better as it keeps the option open to take the wall path towards (0, 9) OR move RIGHT later to get (1, 6). It also puts maximum distance between me and Snake 0, who is likely trying to move up towards the center or down to (5, 1). If Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 2), my move UP to (0, 5) ensures no immediate conflict.\n\nLet's plan to move towards the top left apples ((0, 9) or (1, 6)). Moving UP is the fastest way to gain Y elevation towards both of these.\n\nLong-term plan: Get to the top horizontal strip (Y=9) and clear apples there, starting with (0, 9).\n\nI choose UP.\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe move UP (0, 5) brings me closer to the apples (0, 9) and (1, 6) efficiently. It also maximizes distance from the enemy snake (0, 1) keeping the left wall open for safe movement. I plan to secure the top-left apples first.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

(Closer to (1, 6)).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n2. **Proximity Analysis and Strategy:**\n\nI am currently aiming for the top-left cluster, specifically (0, 9) and (1, 6).\n\n*   (0, 9) is 4 steps UP (Manhattan distance 4).\n*   (1, 6) is 1 step RIGHT and 1 step UP (Manhattan distance 2).\n\nEnemy 0 is at (1, 1). It is likely moving towards (1, 6) or (5, 1). If it goes for (1, 6), it needs to move 5 steps UP.\n\n*   **Move UP to (0, 6):** Puts me adjacent (1 step away) to the apple at (1, 6) in the Y dimension. I can potentially grab (1, 6) on Turn 2 by moving RIGHT. It brings me 3 steps away from (0, 9). This is the fastest vertical progress.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (1, 5):** Puts me 1 step away in Y from (1, 6). This is also a good option for (1, 6), but it moves me away from the safety of the left wall and further from (0, 9).\n*   **Move DOWN to (0, 4):** Moves away from the closest apples and closer to Snake 0 if it decides to move up the left wall. Generally poor.\n\n**Choosing between UP and RIGHT:**\n\nIf I choose UP (0, 6):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (1, 6) and eat the apple. This guarantees an apple (assuming the enemy doesn't block me, which is unlikely as they are at (1, 1)).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (1, 5):\nNext turn I can move UP to (1, 6) and eat the apple.\n\nBoth moves secure the apple (1, 6) on the next turn.\n\nComparing future prospects:\n*   (0, 6) offers a straight path to (0, 9) while also accessing (1, 6).\n*   (1, 5) is slightly less optimal for transitioning to (0, 9).\n\nLet's look at the enemy Snake 0 at (1, 1).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (1, 2), it is 4 steps away from (1, 6).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 1), it might go for (5, 1).\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 6):\nIf Snake 0 moves UP, it is still far away. My move to (1, 6) next turn is safe from Snake 0, as they cannot reach (1, 6) in two moves.\n\nIf I prioritize (1, 6), both UP and RIGHT are 1-turn setups.\nHowever, moving UP (0, 5) -> (0, 6) maintains control of the left side of the board and provides immediate vertical progress towards (0, 9) afterwards.\n\nI will choose UP to position myself for the closest apple (1, 6) on the next turn, and maintain trajectory for (0, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (0, 6), then RIGHT to (1, 6) to eat the apple. After eating (1, 6) (and growing to length 2 at (1, 6), (0, 6)), move UP along the left wall towards (0, 9).\n\nUP",

This cell contains an apple.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n2. **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 6):** This path immediately captures the closest apple. Since my snake is currently length 1, I will move to (1, 6) and instantly grow to length 2 at (1, 6), (0, 6).\n    *   *Collision risk:* Enemy 0 is at (2, 1). It is 5 steps away from (1, 6). There is no risk of a head-on collision or interception.\n    *   *Benefit:* Gain 1 apple, increase length, and secure a strong starting position.\n\n*   **UP to (0, 7):** Moves non-optimally toward (0, 9) while ignoring the immediate (1, 6). If I move UP, I allow the enemy snake to potentially move toward the top or, if they are aiming for (5, 1), they continue on that path. But mainly, I miss the immediate opportunity.\n\n*   **DOWN to (0, 5):** Moves away from all targets. Bad idea.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 6) is the immediate priority. It secures the first apple safely.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating (1, 6), the snake will be at (1, 6) with a body segment at (0, 6). The next closest apple is (0, 9) (3 moves away) or (6, 8). I should prioritize moving UP to (1, 7) or LEFT to (0, 6) and then UP along the left wall towards (0, 9). Given my new head position (1, 6) and body position (0, 6), moving UP to (1, 7) keeps me one step away from the body, and moving LEFT to (0, 6) would potentially kill me if I move into the tail location (which is where the tail **was** before the growth, but since I am only length 1 and grew, the body segment (0, 6) is not a tail that disappears, it is a body segment).\n\nWait, the rule: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". The new segment appears at the old tail's position, but since I have no body, the segment appears at the location the head just vacated.\nIf I move (0, 6) -> (1, 6) [Apple eaten].\nNew snake is: Head (1, 6), Body (0, 6).\nThe next turn, my safe moves are:\n*   UP (1, 7): Safe. Moves toward (0, 9) and (6, 8).\n*   DOWN (1, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (0, 6): Deadly (into body).\n*   RIGHT (2, 6): Safe.\n\nTherefore, after the move RIGHT, I should continue UP toward the northern goals (0, 9) or (6, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

Moves along the middle of the board.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity and Pathing:**\n\nWe are looking for (7, 9), (6, 8), (0, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2).\n\n*   (0, 9): Manhattan distance (MD) = $|1-0| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4$\n*   (6, 8): MD = $|1-6| + |6-8| = 5 + 2 = 7$\n\nThe closest apple is (0, 9) at 4 steps. The next closest is (5, 1) or (5, 2) but the enemy is oriented towards that corner. Let's focus on the northern goals.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 7):**\n    *   New distance to (0, 9): $|1-0| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3$. This is the optimal path towards (0, 9), requiring one more LEFT move and then UP moves.\n    *   Enemy 0 is at (3, 1). It is 5 steps away from (1, 7). No immediate collision risk.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 5):**\n    *   Moves away from the closest apple (0, 9). Increases distance to 5. Bad.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n    *   New distance to (0, 9): $|2-0| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5$. Moves away from (0, 9).\n    *   New distance to (6, 8): $|2-6| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6$. Slightly worse than UP.\n\n3. **Enemy Consideration:**\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (3, 1). It is positioned to attack (5, 1) or (5, 2). If Snake 0 moves UP to (3, 2), (4, 1) or (2, 1) (if it moved left last turn), its primary target is likely the clusters at (5, 1) and (5, 2). I am safely occupying the left side of the board and should leverage my position for (0, 9).\n\n4. **Decision:**\n\nMoving UP to (1, 7) optimizes my path toward the closest remaining apple (0, 9) while keeping me safe and away from the enemy's likely trajectory.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 7). Next, move LEFT to (0, 7), then UP towards (0, 9). If Snake 0 attempts to challenge the top left, I might detour to (6, 8) or try to race them.\n\nUP",

This is the shortest path.\n    *   This move takes us directly into the left wall zone, enabling rapid progress towards (0, 9).\n*   **Move UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   New distance to (0, 9): $|1-0| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2$. This path is equally short in terms of MD, but it keeps us off the wall, potentially making the final move harder if the enemy somehow challenged the top-left area. However, it's a very strong contender.\n\n3. **Enemy Consideration:**\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (4, 1). It is very far away, focusing on the (5, 1)/(5, 2) cluster.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (0, 7), I secure the left column, preventing the enemy from challenging (0, 9) easily.\n*   If I move UP to (1, 8), I maintain central positioning but keep moving towards the goal.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP result in MD 2 to (0, 9). Let's evaluate the future steps.\n\n*   **Scenario A: Move LEFT (0, 7).**\n    *   Next turn (T5): UP (0, 8), distance 1.\n    *   Next turn (T6): UP (0, 9), Capture!\n    *   This is a clean two-move capture.\n\n*   **Scenario B: Move UP (1, 8).**\n    *   Next turn (T5): Either UP (1, 9) (distance 1) or LEFT (0, 8) (distance 1).\n    *   If I move UP to (1, 9): T6, LEFT to (0, 9), Capture!\n    *   If I move LEFT to (0, 8): T6, UP to (0, 9), Capture!\n    *   This is also a clean two-move capture.\n\nBoth moves are equally efficient in terms of distance to the goal.\n\n**Choosing between LEFT and UP:**\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) hugs the wall. This limits maneuverability momentarily but also guarantees a clean line directly to the apple (0, 9) without worrying about boundary issues or straying right. Given the enemy is nowhere near, securing the wall path seems marginally safer and more decisive.\n\n4. **Collision Check (Head-on):**\nSince the enemy is at (4, 1) and is length 1, there is zero risk of collision near (0, 7) or (1, 8).\n\n5. **Decision:**\nI will move LEFT to (0, 7) to lock in the easy two-turn path to (0, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 7), then UP towards (0, 9). After consuming (0, 9), the next closest major cluster is (6, 8) and (7, 9) in the top right. I will assess if the enemy has secured (5, 1)/(5, 2) by then.\n\nLEFT",

Length: 3.\nApples: (7, 9), (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 5), (1, 3).\n\n**Objective:** Continue moving right along the top wall (Y=9) to secure the cluster of apples at (7, 9) and (8, 9). We need to analyze the potential collision with Snake #0 near (6, 9) or (7, 9).\n\n1. **Safety Check (From (5, 9), Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9)]):**\n\n   *   **UP (5, 10):** Deadly (Off board).\n   *   **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe.\n   *   **LEFT (4, 9):** Deadly (Into body segment).

Potential collision with Snake #0.\n\nSafe moves (internal): DOWN (5, 8), RIGHT (6, 9).\n\n2. **Enemy Snake #0 Analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 7). Body: [(6, 6), (6, 5)].\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP: (6, 8) (Apple, likely choice).\n*   DOWN: (6, 6) (Into body/tail, illegal if body segment is (6, 6)). Wait, the body list is [(6, 6), (6, 5)]. Moving to (6, 6) hits its own body. Snake #0 must have chosen a move for T11 that resulted in head (6, 7), body (6, 6), (6, 5). If (6, 6) was the previous head position, and (6, 7) is the current head, then the previous body was (6, 5), (6, 4). The new body is based on the T11 move.\n    *   T11: Snake #0 Head was (6, 6). If it moved UP to (6, 7), then the new body is [(6, 6), (6, 5)]. This is correct based on the provided state.\n    *   Therefore, Snake #0 cannot move to (6, 6) because it is its body segment.\n*   LEFT: (5, 7) (Safe).\n*   RIGHT: (7, 7) (Safe).\n\nIf Snake #0 chooses **UP (6, 8)** (targeting the apple):\n*   Head 1 moves to (6, 9).\n*   Head 0 moves to (6, 8) (Eats apple, grows).\n*   Result: Both moves are safe from collision. We are now 1 step away from the apple at (7, 9). Snake #0 is now very close to (7, 9) as well.\n\nIf Snake #0 chooses **RIGHT (7, 7)**:\n*   Head 1 moves to (6, 9).\n*   Head 0 moves to (7, 7).\n*   Result: Both moves are safe from collision. We are 1 step closer to the apple cluster. Snake #0 is moving away from the Y=9 row.\n\nIf Snake #0 chooses **LEFT (5, 7)**:\n*   Head 1 moves to (6, 9).\n*   Head 0 moves to (5, 7).\n*   Result: Both moves are safe from collision. We are 1 step closer to the apple cluster. Snake #0 is moving away from the Y=9 row.\n\nThe most threatening scenario for us is if Snake #0 also aims for (6, 9) or (7, 9).\nIf we choose RIGHT to (6, 9):\n*   Is it possible for Snake #0 to move to (6, 9)? Snake #0 is at (6, 7). It would require 2 moves (e.g., UP, UP) just to reach (6, 9). Since moves are simultaneous, a collision at (6, 9) is impossible this turn.\n\n3. **Strategic Consideration (RIGHT vs. DOWN):**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Directly advances toward (7, 9) and (8, 9). This is the best offensive move. It positions us to grab the first apple next turn if Snake #0 doesn't intercept (e.g., Snake #0 moves to (7, 8) next turn, then (7, 9)).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 8):** This is a defensive move, maintaining separation from Snake #0, but completely deviates from the apple cluster target and allows Snake #0 free access to (6, 8) and maybe even (7, 9).\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is at (6, 7), it is highly likely to take the apple at (6, 8). This move is geographically focused on the left half of the top cluster and is beneficial for us as it keeps Snake #0 away from (7, 9) this turn.\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (6, 9), we secure the right flank of the Y=9 row.\n\n4. **Prediction and Plan:**\nWe move RIGHT to (6, 9).\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves UP to (6, 8) (eats apple).\nNext Turn (T13): Our Head at (6, 9). Snake #0 Head at (6, 8).\nWe can then move RIGHT to (7, 9) and eat the apple, assuming Snake #0 does not anticipate this and move RIGHT to (7, 8) and then UP to (7, 9) in a blocking attempt.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves to (7, 7) or (5, 7), we are even safer to proceed right.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the necessary aggressive play to capture the required apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 5 turns):**\n1. Move RIGHT to (6, 9). (T12) (Current move)\n2. Move RIGHT to (7, 9) (Consume A). T13.\n3. Move RIGHT to (8, 9) (Consume A). T14.\n4. Move LEFT/DOWN towards (9, 5) or (1, 3) depending on new apple spawning and Snake #0 position.\n\nRIGHT",

Length: 4 (since we just ate an apple).\nEnemy Snake #0: Head: (7, 8), Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. Length: 4.\nApples: (8, 9), (9, 5), (1, 3), (2, 1), (0, 8).\n\n**Review of Last Turn (Turn 13):**\nWe moved RIGHT from (6, 9) to (7, 9), consuming an apple. Our new body is [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)].\nSnake #0's last move must have been RIGHT as well, from (6, 8) to (7, 8). Its body is now [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)].\n\n**Current Situation and Objectives:**\nWe are at (7, 9), adjacent to the next apple at (8, 9). Snake #0 is one step behind us at (7, 8). We are in a strong position to secure the next apple.\n\nWe must choose a move from (7, 9).\n\n**1. Safety Check (From (7, 9)):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 10):** Deadly (Off board).\n*   **DOWN (7, 8):** Deadly (Into Snake #0's current head position (7, 8)).\n*   **LEFT (6, 9):** Deadly (Into own body segment).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 9):** Safe relative to board and own body. This is an apple.\n\n(Note: Only RIGHT is internally safe/feasible.)\n\n**2. Enemy Snake #0 Analysis (Head at (7, 8), Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]):**\nSnake #0's potential moves:\n\n*   **UP (7, 9):** Deadly (Head-on collision with our current position (7, 9), or we move away and S0 hits our previous head position which is now safe if we grow, or S0 hits the apple if we move elsewhere). However, if we move RIGHT to (8, 9), S0 moving UP to (7, 9) is safe for S0 (it eats the former apple location, which is now empty).\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** Safe. Moves S0 away from the apples.\n*   **LEFT (6, 8):** Deadly (Into its own body segment).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 8):** Safe. Moves S0 closer to the apple cluster.\n\n**3. Move Selection and Collision Analysis:**\n\nWe are forced to choose RIGHT (8, 9) due to geometry and body placement.\n\n**Move: RIGHT (8, 9) (Apple)**\n\n*   **Self-Preservation:** Safe from off-board and self-collision.\n*   **Value:** Secures the apple.\n*   **Collision with S0 Head (S0 at (7, 8)):**\n    *   For S0 to hit (8, 9) it would need to jump two spaces (impossible).\n*   **Collision with S0 Body:** S0 body is [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. (8, 9) is not occupied by S0 body.\n\nSince we are moving onto an apple, this move is perfect. We will grow to length 5.\n\n**4. Considering S0's Response if we move RIGHT:**\nS0 is at (7, 8). It will likely move UP to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8).\n\n*   If S0 moves UP to (7, 9): It occupies our former head position and is now directly behind us, threatening the Y=9 lane.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 8): It positions itself below the apple we just consumed.\n\nIn either case, our move RIGHT is safe, high-value, and maintains the lead.\n\n**Long-term strategy (T15+):**\nAfter securing (8, 9), our head will be (8, 9), and our body will start blocking the Y=9 lane. The next closest valuable apple is (9, 5).\nIf S0 moves to (7, 9), S0 will be one step away from (8, 9) (now occupied by us), and two steps away from (9, 9) (off board). We will be in a prime position to move towards (9, 5) or potentially (9, 9) if we need space.\n\nFuture turn T15 plan: From (8, 9):\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 9) (Off board, potentially bad but creates space). If S0 is at (7, 9) this move is safe.\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 8) (Contested by S0 if it moves RIGHT).\n3. Move LEFT to (7, 9) (Into own body segment).\n\nIf S0 moves to (7, 9), we should prioritize moving to (9, 9) (if safe from collision with S0's path) or moving DOWN/RIGHT toward (9, 5). But let's secure the apple first.\n\nRIGHT",

We are currently leading in score. Snake #0 must have moved from (7, 8) to (7, 7) or (8, 8). Looking at the board, Snake #0's head is now at (7, 7). Its body is [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)]. This means Snake #0 moved DOWN from (7, 8) to (7, 7).\n\nOur head is at (8, 9). We are in the top right corner.\nBoard map reference:\n 9 . . . . T T T T 1 .\n 8 A . . . . . T T . .\n 7 . . . . . .

State of Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (7, 7), Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)]):**\nSnake #0's potential safe moves:\n\n*   **UP (7, 8):** Deadly (Moves into its own body segment).\n*   **DOWN (7, 6):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (6, 7):** Deadly (Moves into its own body segment).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe.\n\nSnake #0 will likely move DOWN (7, 6) or RIGHT (8, 7). Moving RIGHT (8, 7) places it closer to the apples (9, 5) and (8, 4).\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (Target Apple: (9, 5) is 3 steps away, (8, 4) is 5 steps away):**\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (9, 9)**\n*   **Value:** It secures peripheral space and positions us for a move toward (9, 5).\n*   **Follow-up:** From (9, 9), we can only move DOWN (9, 8) or LEFT (8, 9, back into body/tail path). We move down the Y=9 wall.\n*   **Collision:** (9, 9) is safe from S0 [(7, 7) range].\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (8, 8)**\n*   **Value:** Moves us towards the general cluster of apples at (9, 5) and (8, 4). It also positions us defensively, blocking access to the Y=8 lane potentially.\n*   **Follow-up:** From (8, 8), we can move UP (8, 9, into body/tail path), DOWN (8, 7), LEFT (7, 8, into body segment), or RIGHT (9, 8). Good options.\n*   **Collision:**\n    *   If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 7), we are safe.\n    *   If S0 moves DOWN to (7, 6), we are safe.\n    *   S0 cannot reach (8, 8) in one step. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\n\nMoving RIGT to (9, 9) commits us heavily to the right edge and limits our options next turn to (9, 8). This is okay, as (9, 8) is a good trajectory towards (9, 5).\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 8) gives us more flexibility: we can turn RIGHT to (9, 8) or continue DOWN to (8, 7). This seems the most central path to the next group of apples.\n\nLet's look at the proximity to (9, 5).\nFrom (8, 9):\n*   Target (9, 5).\n*   Path 1 (RIGHT then DOWN): (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5). 5 steps total.\n*   Path 2 (DOWN then RIGHT): (8, 8) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5). 5 steps total (or (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> ... longer).\n\nIf we move to (8, 8), we open up two primary paths: towards (9, 5) via (9, 8) and towards (8, 4) via (8, 7).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 9), we commit to the Y=9 lane, which is slightly restrictive but guarantees progression towards (9, 5).\n\nSince we want to maintain spatial advantage and flexibility, (8, 8) feels better. It allows us to react to S0's move. If S0 moves to (8, 7), we can move RIGHT to (9, 8) to secure space near the top edge and continue towards (9, 5). If S0 moves to (7, 6), we can move DOWN to (8, 7) to keep pressuring S0 and approach (8, 4).\n\nLet's choose **DOWN (8, 8)** for maximum flexibility and movement towards the apple cluster.\n\n**Post-Move Plan (T16+):**\nHead at (8, 8). S0 likely at (8, 7) or (7, 6).\nNext target: (9, 5). Requires moving RIGHT toward (9, 8).\nIf S0 moves to (8, 7): We must move RIGHT to (9, 8) to avoid collision and continue toward (9, 5).\nIf S0 moves to (7, 6): We can move RIGHT to (9, 8) or DOWN to (8, 7). (8, 7) is safer and further pressures S0's movement options.\n\nWe will prioritize (9, 5) first, as it is a less contested region currently.\n\nPlan for T16: If we move DOWN to (8, 8) now, next turn we will likely move RIGHT to (9, 8).\n\nDOWN",

We remain focused on (9, 5).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (9, 7): It targets (9, 5). We will be at (9, 8), setting up an apple eat next turn.\n\nOur move RIGHT (9, 8) is critical because it avoids immediate death and continues our scoring trajectory.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (9, 8).\n2.  Next turn (T17), move DOWN to (9, 7). S0 might be at (9, 7) from the previous turn, risking collision. We must check T17 moves carefully.\n3.  If S0 moves to (9, 7) this turn (T16), then next turn (T17) we would be forced to move LEFT (8, 7) [risking S0 body] or UP (9, 9) [away from apple].\n4.  If S0 moves DOWN to (8, 6), T17 we move DOWN to (9, 7), and then DOWN to (9, 6), and then to (9, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nLet's assume S0's highest priority is the closest apple (8, 4) or (9, 5).\nS0 is at (8, 7). (8, 4) is 3 steps total (8, 6 -> 8, 5 -> 8, 4).\n(9, 5) is 4 steps total (9, 7 -> 9, 6 -> 9, 5).\nS0 is likely to prioritize (8, 4) by moving DOWN (8, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves to (8, 6):\nT16: 1->(9, 8).

Safety Check (From (9, 8)):**\n\n*   **UP (9, 9):** Safe.

Moving DOWN results in a head-on collision. DEADLY.\n    *   If S0 moved DOWN (to 8, 6): S0 is at (8, 6). (9, 7) is safe.\n    *   We must assume the worst case (S0 went to 9, 7) or analyze which collision is more likely. S0 moving to (9, 7) targets (9, 5) which is 3 steps away. S0 moving to (8, 6) targets (8, 4) which is 2 steps away. (8, 4) is the closer apple. Assuming S0 is rational, it targeted (8, 4) -> (8, 6). **I will proceed assuming S0 is at (8, 6).**\n*   **LEFT (8, 8):** Deadly (Into own body segment).\n*   **RIGHT (10, 8):** Deadly (Off board).\n\nBased on the assumption that S0 moved to (8, 6), the safe moves are UP (9, 9) and DOWN (9, 7).\nTarget apple (9, 5) is 2 steps away via (9, 7).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Target Apple: (9, 5))**\n\nWe are at (9, 8). (9, 5) is 3 steps away (via 9, 7 -> 9, 6 -> 9, 5).\n\nMove **DOWN (9, 7)**:\n1.  Moves one step closer to (9, 5).\n2.  Keeps momentum towards the apple.\n3.  Future path: (9, 6) then (9, 5) (EAT T19).\n\n**3. Prediction for Snake #0 (Head at (8, 6), Body: [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]):**\nS0 is targeting apple (8, 4).\n*   UP (8, 7): Deadly (Into own body segment (8, 7)).\n*   DOWN (8, 5): Safe. On path to (8, 4).\n*   LEFT (7, 6): Safe. Moves away from apples.\n*   RIGHT (9, 6): Safe. Positions for (9, 5). Contests our path.\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN (8, 5), it is one step away from (8, 4).\nT17: 1->(9, 7). S0->(8, 5).\nT18: 1->(9, 6). S0->(8, 4) [EATS].\nT19: 1->(9, 5) [EATS].\nThis is optimal if nobody interferes.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (9, 6): S0 targets my apple (9, 5).\nT17: 1->(9, 7). S0->(9, 6).\nT18: Head-on collision risk! S0 is at (9, 6). I want to move to (9, 6). DEADLY.\n\n**Risk Assessment for S0 moving RIGHT (9, 6):**\nWhy would S0 choose (9, 6) over (8, 5)?\n(8, 4) is 2 steps away via (8, 5).\n(9, 5) is 2 steps away via (9, 6).\nBoth apples are equally close to S0's current *trajectory* (if S0 was at 8, 7 last turn). However, being at (8, 6), S0 is better positioned for (8, 4).\n\nIf S0 perceives me moving towards (9, 5) (which I did by moving RIGHT to 9, 8), S0 might try to cut me off or steal the apple.\n\nIf I move UP (9, 9), I guarantee safety for this turn, but lose ground on (9, 5).\nIf I move DOWN (9, 7), I risk a head-on collision at (9, 6) next turn if S0 chooses the aggressive path (9, 6) this turn.\n\nLet's re-analyze S0's position relative to all apples available:\nA1 (9, 5): 2 steps (via 9, 6)\nA2 (8, 4): 2 steps (via 8, 5)\nA3 (1, 3): 7 steps\nA4 (2, 1): 7 steps\nA5 (0, 8): 8 steps\n\nS0 has two equally desirable apples closest: (8, 4) and (9, 5). Since I seem committed to (9, 5) (by moving to 9, 8), S0 might choose (8, 4) to ensure a guaranteed score, minimizing collision risk.\n\nIf S0 moves (8, 5) (towards 8, 4): I move (9, 7), safe.\nIf S0 moves (9, 6) (towards 9, 5): I move (9, 7), safe. But T18 collision risk is high.\n\nIf S0 moves (9, 6), S0 is now directly between me and (9, 5).\nT17: 1->(9, 7). S0->(9, 6).\nT18: 1 must move (8, 7) or (9, 8, which is now a body segment), or (9, 9) or (10, 7) (off map).\nWait, if I move to (9, 7), and S0 moves to (9, 6), S0 is directly below me.\nFrom (9, 7), my safe moves for T18 are:\n1. UP (9, 8) (now body segment/safe if I grew, unsafe if tail moved) -> My T segment (9, 8) moves to (8, 8). So (9, 8) is safe.\n2. LEFT (8, 7) -> S0's old body segment (8, 7) is now S0's tail tip? No, S0's body is [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]. Tail (7, 8) moves to (7, 7). (8, 7) moves to (7, 7). The square behind S0 is (8, 7). S0's new body is [(8, 7)] segments plus new tail position. Given S0 Head is at (9, 6), S0 body will be [(8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. Wait, S0 body head to tail: (H), (B1), (B2), (B3).\nIf S0 moves (9, 6):\nNew S0 Head (9, 6).\nOld B1 (8, 7) moves to (8, 7). Still B1.\nOld B2 (7, 7) moves to (7, 7). Still B2.\nOld B3 (7, 8) moves to (7, 7). No, tail usually moves where B3 was. **Tail disappears.**\nNew S0 body: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. Oh, I misinterpreted body movement.\nIf S0 moves (9, 6):\nBody shifts: (8, 6) becomes B1. (8, 7) becomes B2. (7, 7) becomes B3. (7, 8) is now empty space.\nSo, if S0 moves to (9, 6), (7, 8) is open, (8, 7) is occupied, (8, 6) is occupied, (7, 7) is occupied.\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 7) and S0 moves RIGHT to (9, 6):\nT18 from (9, 7):\n*   To (9, 6): Deadly collision risk with opponent's body or head.\n*   To (8, 7): Deadly (S0 body B2 is here).\n*   To (9, 8): Safe.\n\nIf S0 goes for (9, 6), I cannot risk (9, 7) as it makes T18 challenging and requires me to move backward (9, 8) or away (9, 9).\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Move UP (9, 9).**\nThis guarantees safety and forces S0's hand on (9, 5) or (8, 4).\nIf I move UP (9, 9):\nIf S0 moves (8, 5): T18: S0 gets (8, 4). I can move DOWN (9, 8) then DOWN (9, 7). I lost a turn but gained guaranteed safety.\nIf S0 moves (9, 6): T18: S0 is positioned to get (9, 5) next turn. I am at (9, 8). I can move DOWN (9, 8). S0 gets (9, 5).\n\nSince I have the lead (4 apples vs 3), prioritizing absolute safety is paramount, especially when the move DOWN has a non-zero probability of leading to a trapped position if S0 decides to contest (9, 5).\n\nHowever, if I concede (9, 5) by moving UP, S0 catches up to 5 apples vs my 4. I must try to get (9, 5) first.\n\nLet's revisit the assumption: S0 prioritizing (8, 4) is highly probable since it's the slightly shorter path in terms of coordinates (y=3 vs y=2 distance difference). (8, 4) is 2 moves away via (8, 5), and (9, 5) is 2 moves away via (9, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves (8, 5) (towards 8, 4), then DOWN (9, 7) is the optimal move.\nT17: I (9, 7), S0 (8, 5).\nT18: I (9, 6), S0 (8, 4) [Eats].\nT19: I (9, 5) [Eats].\n\nThis seems the most logical outcome, assuming S0 plays rationally and defensively (not aggressively targeting collision).\n\n**Final decision on DOWN (9, 7) vs UP (9, 9):**\nIf I move DOWN, I maximize my speed towards the apple and maintain a likely competitive advantage. The risk of S0 proactively moving to (9, 6) just to block me, instead of taking their guaranteed score at (8, 4), is low but exists. However, if S0 moves to (9, 6), they are likely giving up (8, 4) to me, as I can move (8, 7) next turn (assuming S0's body (8, 7) is now (8, 6) and (8, 7) is open).\nWait, if S0 moves to (9, 6):\nS0 head (9, 6). S0 body [(8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)].\nIf I am at (9, 7), T18, I cannot move to (8, 7) (S0 body) or (9, 6) (S0 head/body). I am forced back to (9, 8) or UP (9, 9). I lost a turn and S0 is winning the race to (9, 5).\n\nI need to confirm S0's absolute safest path for T16.\nS0 at (8, 7). Safe moves: DOWN (8, 6), RIGHT (9, 7).\nIf S0 moved RIGHT to (9, 7), then my move DOWN (9, 7) results in a head-on collision right now.\n\nLet's check the absolute worst case: S0 chose the path that maximizes the collision probability with me.\nS0's possible location: (8, 6) OR (9, 7).\nIf S0 is at (9, 7), I must move away. UP (9, 9).\nIf S0 is at (8, 6), I can move DOWN (9, 7).\n\nSince the choice between (8, 6) and (9, 7) was ambiguous for S0 based on apple distance, I must assume S0 potentially moved to contest (9, 5) if they saw my move to (9, 8) coming, or took the slightly safer, closer option (8, 4).\n\nIf I move UP (9, 9), I survive regardless of S0's T16 move.\nIf I move DOWN (9, 7), I die if S0 moved to (9, 7) on T16.\n\nSince I don't have perfect information on S0's last move, and one of the two likely safe moves for S0 leads to instant death for me this turn (T17) if I choose DOWN, I must choose the absolutely safe move: UP.\n\n**Rethink: Did I assume S0 moved DOWN (8, 6) in the Rationale of T16?**\nYes, I wrote: \"S0 is likely to prioritize (8, 4) by moving DOWN (8, 6).\"\nThis was a prediction, not guaranteed.\n\nGiven the potential for immediate death, I prioritize survival over scoring speed.\n\nMove: UP (9, 9).\n\n**New Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move UP (9, 9) for safety.\n2. Observe S0's actual T17 position.\n3. If S0 moved to (8, 5) (towards 8, 4), I move DOWN (9, 8), then DOWN (9, 7), giving S0 the (8, 4) but setting up for (9, 5).\n4. If S0 moved to (9, 6) or (9, 7) (contesting 9, 5), I must pivot away from (9, 5) towards (0, 8).\n\nUP",

Their score will become 4.\n\nMy Goal: Reach (9, 5) while maintaining safety.\n\n**2. Safety Check (From (9, 9))**\n\n*   **UP (9, 10):** Deadly (Off board).\n*   **DOWN (9, 8):** Safe. This is my body segment (B1), but since the tail (7, 9) will move, (9, 8) will become open if I don't eat an apple. Since no apple is available, (9, 8) becomes the new free space.\n    *   My new body: Head (9, 8). Body shifted: [(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. The segment (9, 8) is now empty. YES, safe.\n*   **LEFT (8, 9):** Deadly (Into own body segment).\n*   **RIGHT (10, 9):** Deadly (Off board).\n\nOnly one safe move: DOWN (9, 8).\n\n**3. Move Evaluation: DOWN (9, 8)**\n\nThis is the only legal move. It places me one step closer to (9, 5).\n\n*   T18: Me (9, 8). S0 (8, 4) [EATS]. (Score: 4/4)\n*   T19: Me (9, 7).

Once (9, 5) is secured, the next logical apples are (0, 8) and (1, 3). Since (0, 8) is closer to my current position and along the path of travel after (9, 5), I will aim for (0, 8) next.\n\nDOWN",
