My goal is to collect as many apples as possible and avoid running into other snakes or the walls.\n\nSince I'm currently at (6, 3), I have a few options. I could try to move towards the apple at (3, 2) to the left, or I could try to move towards the apple at (0, 6) to the left and down. However, I should also consider the position of Snake #1, which is at (7, 9). If I move too far to the left, I might run into Snake #1.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the apple at (3, 2) to the left, and then see how things develop from there.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
