DOWN would hit your neck, which is suicide.\n- UP keeps us moving toward the upper apple cluster (around x=6-7, y=8-9) and preserves multiple escape options. LEFT heads toward the middle-left apples but could tighten space sooner; RIGHT increases distance from the cluster and nudges toward the enemy side.\n- The current open space suggests UP is the safest immediate choice that also promotes future apple access and maneuverability.\n\nPlan:\n- Push upward toward the top apples, then maneuver to eat (6,8) or (7,9) while keeping a route back toward the board center if the enemy closes in.\n\nUP",
