UP: (2, 10) - Illegal, off the board (Y > 9). **Eliminated.**\n2. DOWN: (2, 8)\n3. LEFT: (1, 9)\n4. RIGHT: (3, 9)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (9, 9).\n\nLet's check safety for the remaining moves:\n\n**Snake Body Check:**\nMy snake body is just the head H(2, 9) since the body list is empty. Moving backwards would take me to the cell *behind* (2, 9), which is not currently occupied by my body. Since my body is only the head, there is no cell *directly behind* the head that I will occupy after moving, regardless of the move (the tail position is irrelevant for self-collision on the next move, only the previous head position matters if I were longer, but here I just can't move into my *current* head position, which isn't possible anyway, or the cell immediately behind the head if the snake had length > 1). Since my length is 1 (head only), the only self-collision concern is normally moving back into my own previous position, but since I have 0 apples, my length is 1. The previous position *was* the head position (2, 9). Moving to (2, 8) leaves (2, 9) empty. Moving to (1, 9) leaves (2, 9) empty. Moving to (3, 9) leaves (2, 9) empty. Self-collision is not an issue with length 1 unless I moved into the cell I just occupied on a previous turn, but since this is Turn 0, Self-Collision only means moving backward into the cell that *would* be the neck if I had one, which is not relevant for length 1 moving one step. Standard rule: Moving directly backwards into your own body (which is just the previous head position if length > 1) counts as hitting yourself. Since I have length 1, there is no body segment behind me. All moves are safe regarding my own body.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check:**\nEnemy head E1 is at (9, 9).\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 8): Safe from E1.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 9): Safe from E1.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 9): Safe from E1.\n\n**Apple Analysis & Strategy:**\nMy current position is (2, 9).\nAvailable Apples:\nA1: (3, 6) - Distance: 3 moves minimum if clear path.\nA2: (8, 4) - Distance: 6 moves minimum if clear path.\nA3: (3, 9) - **Adjacent, reachable in 1 move (RIGHT).**\nA4: (9, 3) - Distance: 8 moves minimum if clear path.\nA5: (1, 6) - Distance: 3 moves minimum if clear path.\n\nThe closest apple is A3 at (3, 9), which is immediately to the RIGHT of my current head (2, 9).\n\n**Move RIGHT to (3, 9):**\n1. **Apple:** I eat A3 at (3, 9). I score 1, and my length becomes 2 (H gains segment).\n2. **Enemy Move:** E1 at (9, 9) moves. E1's safe moves are DOWN (9, 8), LEFT (8, 9). E1 cannot move UP (off board) or RIGHT (off board). E1 will likely move to (9, 8) or (8, 9) to stay central, or potentially towards A2(8, 4) or A4(9, 3). (8, 9) looks like a reasonable move for E1 if they aim for the top edge.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I get an apple and grow. This is usually the best strategy when an apple is immediately available and the move is safe.\n\n**Move DOWN to (2, 8):**\n1. **Apple:** No apple.\n2. **Enemy Move:** E1 moves.\n\n**Move LEFT to (1, 9):**\n1. **Apple:** No apple.\n2. **Enemy Move:** E1 moves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT immediately secures an apple (A3 at (3, 9)), increases my score and length, and the move itself is safe (not off-board, no immediate self-collision, no immediate collision with E1 at (9, 9)). Gaining length first is highly advantageous in the early game.\n\nLong-Term Plan Note: Prioritize immediate apple acquisition when safe, especially when the target is adjacent, as this rapidly increases competitive advantage. After securing this apple, I will be at (3, 9) and snake length 2. My next priority will be A5(1, 6) or A1(3, 6), moving down the board structure.\n\nPredicted new state after RIGHT move:\nMy head: (3, 9). Length: 2. Apples: 1. Body: (2, 9).\nApples remaining: (3, 6), (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6).\n\nThe best immediate move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

They are directly below me, and we will be in the same space on the next turn. I need to avoid ending up directly below Snake #0.\n\n**Possible Moves and Analysis:**\n\n*   **UP:** My head would move to (8, 9). This is safe. It moves towards the apple at (3, 6). However, it would put me in the same position as snake #0.\n*   **DOWN:** My head would move to (10, 9). This is off the board, so I die!\n*   **LEFT:** My head would move to (8, 8). This is safe and moves towards the apple at (8, 4).\n*   **RIGHT:** My head would move to (10, 9). This is off the board, so I die!\n\nTherefore, the safest move is LEFT. This avoids a head-on collision with snake #0 and brings me closer to an apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n\nI need to continue moving towards apples while avoiding snake #0. I should try to move to a position that gives me multiple potential future moves.\n\n**Final Move:**\n\nLEFT\n\n\n\nLEFT",

Possible safe moves were DOWN (8, 8) or LEFT (7, 9). It is standard early game to move away from the edge or towards the center/some apples. E1 did not eat an apple. I must assume a random safe move, or a move that maximizes their future options. Let's check the board implied by the starting state for Turn 2 for E1's actual move. Reviewing the board representation:\nThe board shows '1' at (8, 9). Since E1 started at (8, 9) and did not eat (the score remains 0), E1 performed a move. The board representation for Turn 2 *must* reflect E1's actual move position.\nSince my previous move was RIGHT resulting in my head at (3, 9), and the snake body is now [(2, 9)], the '0' on the board is at (3, 9), and the location (2, 9) is now occupied by the tail segment.\n\nLooking at the board provided for Turn 2:\n 9 . . H 0 . . . . 1 .\nSnake 0 (Me): Head at (3, 9), Body segment at (2, 9). This matches my plan (H is 0, new Head position is 3, 9).\nSnake 1 (Enemy): Head is marked as '1' at (8, 9). This means **Snake #1 did not move** from its position (8, 9) during the previous turn, or the board printout is showing the *start* state of E1's position before their move this turn, which is confusing since the board usually reflects the state *after* the simultaneous move.\n\nCrucially, the board printout shows H at (3, 9) and 0 at (2, 9) for MY snake, and 1 at (8, 9) for the ENEMY snake. This implies my RIGHT move was successful, but the depiction of the enemy snake (1 at 8, 9) suggests E1 *has not moved* yet, which contradicts the simultaneous nature of the turn.\n\nGiven the input structure (\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (3, 9), Body: [(2, 9)]\"), this state *must* be the result of my successful RIGHT move. If it is Turn 2, E1 must have also moved. I will assume the board image reflects the *current* safe zones, and that the '1' at (8, 9) is E1's *current* location after their move, meaning E1 chose a move that kept them at (8, 9) OR E1 moved off board/into an invalid spot causing them to remain stationary (unlikely) OR E1 moved to (8, 9) from an adjacent spot (e.g., (7, 9) or (9, 9) or (8, 8)).\n\nIf E1 started at (9, 9) on Turn 1:\nPossible safe moves: (8, 9) or (9, 8).\nIf E1 moved to (8, 9) as shown on the board, then E1 chose LEFT = (8, 9).\n\n**State for Turn 2 decision:**\nMy Head: (3, 9). Body: [(2, 9)]. My tail is effectively (2, 9) for collision purposes on the next move if I move into (3, 9).\nE1 Head: (8, 9). Body: None.\n\n**Possible Moves for Me (H at 3, 9):**\n1. UP: (3, 10) - Illegal (Off Board). **Eliminated.**\n2. DOWN: (3, 8)\n3. LEFT: (2, 9) - **Collision with my own body segment!** (2, 9) is my neck/body segment. **Killed.** **Eliminated.**\n4. RIGHT: (4, 9)\n\nSafe moves remaining: DOWN (3, 8), RIGHT (4, 9).\n\n**Safety Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (3, 8):**\n1. Self-collision: Safe. My previous position (3, 9) is now empty. My body is at (2, 9). (3, 8) is safe.\n2. E1 Collision: E1 is at (8, 9). (3, 8) is safe from head-on collision.\n3. Future Apple proximity: Moving towards the center region where A1(3, 6) and A4(1, 6) are located. It's a direct path toward the next nearest apple cluster.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (4, 9):**\n1. Self-collision: Safe. (4, 9) is clear.\n2. E1 Collision: E1 is at (8, 9). (4, 9) is safe from head-on collision.\n3. Future Apple proximity: Moving away from immediate apples toward the right edge, further from the nearest apple A1(3, 6). However, it keeps me on the top row, which might allow me to scout wide or retreat.\n\n**Apple Strategy:**\nNearest apples are A1(3, 6) and A4(1, 6). Both require moving down.\n(3, 9) -> DOWN -> (3, 8) -> DOWN -> (3, 7) -> DOWN -> (3, 6) [Apple A1] -> 3 moves total.\n(3, 9) -> RIGHT -> (4, 9) -> DOWN -> (4, 8) -> DOWN -> (4, 7) -> ... This adds distance.\n\nMoving DOWN is superior as it progresses towards the next closest target, A1(3, 6).\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nE1 at (8, 9) is relatively far away. E1 has no apples. E1 is likely aiming for A2(8, 4) or A4(9, 3). If E1 realizes I am moving down, they might also move towards the lower portion too. E1 cannot easily block my path to A1(3, 6) in the next few turns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove DOWN is the only choice that progresses towards the next closest goal while remaining safe, given the critical self-collision risk incurred by moving LEFT into (2, 9).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move DOWN to (3, 8). Continue moving directly toward A1(3, 6) unless E1 presents a direct threat or a closer apple appears. Prioritize A1 then A4(1, 6).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

My snake is now: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 9)]. Length 2.\nApple A1 is at (3, 6). I am 2 steps away.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction (Turn 2 to Turn 3):**\nE1 head was at (8, 9). Safe moves were LEFT (7, 9) or DOWN (8, 8).\nThe board layout given for Turn 3 shows '1' at (9, 9) (Wait, the board shows '1' at (7, 9) based on the analysis above, but the board representation provided in the prompt seems inconsistent or I misinterpreted the T/0 labeling in the initial state versus the resultant state).\n\nLet's re-examine the board position for Turn 2 *starting state* and my previous rationale:\nStart State (Turn 2): H at (3, 9), Body [(2, 9)]. E1 at (8, 9).\nMy move was RIGHT -> New Head at (4, 9). Body segment at (3, 9).\n*The rationale I wrote for my previous move was based on the assumption that my RIGHT move succeeded, but the rationale claims the previous move resulted in H:(3,9), B:[(2,9)]. This implies my move history description is confusing the *result* of the move with the *start* position for the next turn.*\n\nLet's use the provided input for THIS turn (Turn 3):\nMy Snake (ID 0): Head: (3, 8), Body: [(3, 9)]. Collected 1. (This state results from moving DOWN from (3, 9) where the body was [(2, 9)] in the previous step, meaning the TOP APPLE WAS EATEN on Turn 2).\nThe Initial State for Turn 2 had A at (3, 6), (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1). My score was 1.\nIf my move on Turn 2 was RIGHT, and the snake body implies I ate an apple, then the apple eaten *must* have been at (3, 9) if I moved from (2, 9). But the available apples were far away.\n\n**Crucial Correction: Reinterpreting Turn 2 Input**\nTurn 2 Description:\nApples: (3, 6), (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1).\nMy Snake: Head (3, 9), Body [(2, 9)]. Apples: 1. (This is the INITIAL state of Turn 2, BEFORE my MOVE).\nMy Last Move Pick: RIGHT.\nMy Last Move Rationale: \"My previous move was RIGHT, eating the apple at (3, 9).\" -> **This implies the apple list for Turn 2 provided above MUST have included (3, 9) if I ate it, OR my previous state was different.**\n\nLet's trust the resulting state provided for Turn 3:\nMy Head: (3, 8). Body: [(3, 9)].\nThis state implies my move on Turn 2 was move $M_2$, followed by my move on Turn 3 being DOWN.\nIf Head is (3, 8) and Body is [(3, 9)], then my previous head position (Start of Turn 3) was (3, 9).\nIf I moved DOWN to (3, 8), and my body is [(3, 9)], then on Turn 2 I must have moved from (H_prev) to (3, 9) OR (3, 9) was the tail that grew from a previous move.\n\nGiven the input structure, the most reliable source is the \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" block for the current turn (Turn 3):\nHead: (3, 8)\nBody: [(3, 9)]\nApples: 1\n\nThis means on Turn 2, my head landed on (3, 8) or I moved relative to a previous position that resulted in this (3, 8) head. This contradicts my previous rationale which claimed I moved RIGHT.\n\nLet's assume the input provided for Turn 3 reflects the *actual* current state after my last move (DOWN) was executed successfully in the previous simulated step (which was Turn 2).\n**State after Turn 2 Move (DOWN):** Head (3, 8). Body [(3, 9)] (meaning (3, 9) was the previous head location, and no apple was eaten, or the game logic assumes standard growth/shrinkage). If I moved DOWN from (3, 9) to (3, 8) without eating, my tail should have *moved* to where the new head came from, meaning the body should shift, and the tail segment vacates.\nIf (H, B) = ((3, 9), [(2, 9)]) at start of T2. Move DOWN results in H=(3, 8).\nNew Body: (3, 9) connects to (3, 8). The old tail (2, 9) is vacating. New Body: [(3, 9)]. Length remains 2.\nSo, if my move during Turn 2 was DOWN, the state at START of Turn 3 should be: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 9)]. This matches the provided state for Turn 3!\nConclusion: **My last move pick (DOWN) listed in the T2 log correctly describes the transition to the T3 state.**\n\n**Enemy State at start of Turn 3 E1:**\nIf E1 started T2 at (8, 9) and moved LEFT to (7, 9) (Safe non-apple move), E1 state is H=(7, 9).\n\n**Apples available for Turn 3:**\n(3, 6), (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1). (No apple was eaten, score remains 1).\n\n**My Position (H=(3, 8), B=[(3, 9)]):**\nTarget: A1 at (3, 6). 2 moves away (DOWN, DOWN).\n\n**Enemy Position (H=(7, 9), B=None):**\nRanging widely initially. Seems focused on the right side or moving inward.\n\n**Possible Moves for Me (H at 3, 8):**\n1. UP: (3, 9) - **Collision with my own body segment!** (3, 9) is my previous head/current neck. **Killed.**\n2. DOWN: (3, 7) - Safe from self. Moves towards A1(3, 6).\n3. LEFT: (2, 8) - Safe from self. Moves slightly towards A4(1, 6).\n4. RIGHT: (4, 8) - Safe from self. Moving away from immediate apples.\n\n**Safety and Strategy Analysis:**\n\n1. **Self-Collision Check:** UP is impossible.\n2. **Head-on Collision Check:** E1 is at (7, 9).\n   * DOWN (3, 7): Safe.\n   * LEFT (2, 8): Safe.\n   * RIGHT (4, 8): Safe.\n3. **Apple Proximity:** DOWN (3, 7) is superior, moving directly toward A1(3, 6).\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n*   **DOWN (3, 7):** Leads directly to A1(3, 6) next turn (if safe). Best path forward.\n*   **LEFT (2, 8):** Moves towards A4(1, 6). Longer path to A1.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 8):** Moves into open space, less efficient pathing towards closest apples.\n\n**Enemy Strategy:** E1 is likely to move towards the center or the right-hand apples (A2 at (8, 4), A3 at (9, 3)). If E1 moves DOWN towards the middle, they might approach my southern trajectory later, but for now, going directly at A1 seems best.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN maximizes pursuit of the closest apple A1(3, 6).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue driving towards A1(3, 6) unless E1 positions herself to intercept dangerously or a closer, safer apple appears. If A1 is eaten, path towards A4(1, 6). Maintain safety paramount, especially avoiding the UP move from (3, 8).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

(3, 6) was eaten last turn according to the board state, but the previous rationale suggests the target was (3, 6) and the current state shows the head at (3, 6). Let's reconcile the state.\n\nPrevious turn (T3): Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 9)]. Apple target (3, 6). Move was DOWN to (3, 7).\nCurrent state (T4): Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 7), (3, 8)]. Apples collected: 2.\n\nIf the move in T3 was DOWN to (3, 7) from (3, 8), the body would become [(3, 8), (3, 9)].\nThe *current* board state shows:\nYour snake (ID 0): Head: (3, 6), Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8)]. Apples collected: 2.\n\nThis implies that in Turn 3, the snake moved from (3, 8) and *ate* an apple at (3, 7) or (3, 6). Given the apple list in T3: (3, 6), (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1).\nIf the snake ate (3, 6) last turn:\nStart T3: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 9)]. Target (3, 6).\nIf the move was UP, it would land on (3, 9) (collision/backwards if it was the neck).\nIf the move was (3, 8) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 6) in one turn, it means the apple must have been at (3, 7) or (3, 6) and the snake grew.\n\n*Reconciling T3 Rationale vs T4 State:*\nT3 Rationale says: Target A1 at (3, 6). Move DOWN to (3, 7).\nIf the move was DOWN to (3, 7), the snake *did not* eat the apple at (3, 6) unless the body shift caused a temporary overlap. Since the snake is now at (3, 6) and has 2 apples, it must have eaten an apple on T3. It seems the state implies the move was *towards* (3, 6) and resulted in collection.\n\nLet's assume the current physical state is correct for T4: Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 7), (3, 8)]. The tail segment (3, 9) from T3 is gone, meaning the snake *did not* grow in T3 or it grew and lost its tail due to movement structure, or the T3 rationale was flawed regarding the apple eaten location.\nSince score increased to 2, an apple was eaten on T3. The apple list in T3 included (3, 6). The snake moved DOWN from (3, 8) to (3, 7). If eating (3, 6) resulted in the head at (3, 6), the move was likely $(\\text{Head}_{T3}) \\to (3, 6)$. If $\\text{Head}_{T3}=(3, 8)$, the move must have been UP or DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT towards (3, 6). A move from (3, 8) to (3, 6) is impossible in one step.\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** The current board state (T4) is the definitive starting point for generating the T4 move, regardless of inconsistencies with the T3 rationale description.\nCurrent State: Head H=(3, 6). Body B={(3, 7), (3, 8)}. Tail T=(3, 8). Length 3. Score 2.\nApples remaining: (8, 4), (9, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (6, 2).\n\n**Enemy State:** E1 H=(5, 9). Length 1. Score 0.\n\n**Movement Analysis (T4):**\nThe snake needs a path to the remaining apples.\nClosest targets (Euclidean distance squared):\n1. (6, 2): $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n2. (8, 4): $5^2 + 2^2 = 25 + 4 = 29$\n3. (2, 1): $1^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26$\n4. (1, 6): $2^2 + 0^2 = 4$ (This is extremely close! (1, 6) is distance 2 away)\n5. (9, 3): $6^2 + 3^2 = 36 + 9 = 45$\n\nWait, let's recheck distance to (1, 6) from (3, 6):\n$|3-1| = 2$ (X distance)\n$|6-6| = 0$ (Y distance)\nDistance is 2. This is the clear nearest target.\n\n**Candidate Moves from H=(3, 6):**\nNeck position is (3, 7). Moving UP to (3, 7) is illegal (self-collision).\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe from self. Moves away from (1, 6). Prepares for potential movement towards (6, 2) or (8, 4) later if needed, but currently slow. Body shifts to [(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9) - if eaten] or [(3, 7), (3, 8)] if not eaten. If no apple eaten, tail (3, 8) is vacated, next body segment is (3, 7).\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe from self. Moves 1 step closer to (1, 6). Safe path towards the closest apple.\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe from self. Moves away from (1, 6).\n4.  **UP to (3, 7):** Illegal (Neck).\n\n**Choosing between LEFT (2, 6) and DOWN (3, 5):**\nLEFT moves directly towards the closest apple (1, 6).\nPath to (1, 6) via LEFT: (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6). This takes 2 turns, assuming E1 doesn't interfere or block.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (E1 at (5, 9)):**\nE1 is far away in the top right corner. E1 is unlikely to interfere with a move to (2, 6) or (1, 6) immediately. If E1 moves down, it might head towards the center/bottom, but it is hard to predict its exact path relative to our goals. For now, prioritizing the closest apple is the best strategy.\n\n**Enemy Collision Check:**\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 6):\nE1 moves from (5, 9) to one of (4, 9), (6, 9), (5, 8). None of these intercept (2, 6). Safe.\n\n**Path Optimization:** Moving LEFT (2, 6) is the superior choice as it directly sets up eating the closest apple (1, 6) next turn.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move towards (1, 6). If eaten, re-evaluate the next closest target (likely (2, 1) or (6, 2)). Maintain awareness of E1 position, currently safe from collision.\n\nLEFT",

This implies the move chosen on Turn 5 resulted in the snake being at (2, 6) if it moved LEFT.\n*   However, the current board state shows: Head (1, 6), Body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]. Apples: 3.\n\nLet's reconcile the current state with the board:\nIf the snake moved LEFT on Turn 5 from (3, 6) to (2, 6), its body would shift/grow if it ate an apple. Since score is 3, it has eaten 3 apples previously.\nIf the snake ate an apple on Turn 5, score would be 3.\nCurrent state: Head (1, 6). This implies the snake moved from (2, 6) to (1, 6) on Turn 6 OR the state shown is *after* Turn 5's move resulted in the head at (1, 6).\n\nGiven the structure of these prompts, the current board state and the turn number (6) represent the situation *at the beginning of Turn 6*, and the \"Last Move Information\" describes what happened on Turn 5.\n\n**Reconstructing Turn 5:**\nIf the current head is (1, 6) at Turn 6, and the previous rational assumed a move towards (1, 6), it seems the snake *already* ate the apple at (1, 6) in the transition from Turn 5 to Turn 6, meaning the snake moved from (2, 6) to (1, 6) on Turn 5 and collected an apple, increasing the score from 2 to 3.\n\n*   If Score was 2 before T5, and is 3 now, an apple was eaten on T5.\n*   If the move on T5 was LEFT, and this resulted in eating (1, 6), the head must have been at (2, 6) prior to T5 move.\n*   Body before T5 move (if score was 2): [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]. (Head 1 segment longer than Body list is 3 long). Tail position would be (3, 7).\n*   If the snake moved LEFT from (2, 6) to (1, 6) and ate an apple:\n    *   New Body (Head to Tail): [(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]. Score 3.\n    *   This contradicts the current stated body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]. (This body implies the tail was *not* left behind on the move that resulted in the current position).\n\n**Conclusion on State Discrepancy:** I must trust the explicit *current* board state provided for Turn 6, regardless of the conflicting rationale block.\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Start of Turn 6):**\nHead: (1, 6)\nBody: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)] (Length 4, 3 apples collected)\nNeck (point behind head): (2, 6)\n\n**Target Apples:** (8, 4), (9, 3), (6, 2), (6, 7). Closest reachable target is (6, 2) or (6, 7) if moving right, or potentially (2, 1) if moving down/left, though (1, 6) was just collected.\n\nLet's map the current closest apples relative to (1, 6):\n1. (6, 2): Distance $\\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 16} = \\sqrt{41} \\approx 6.4$\n2. (8, 4): Distance $\\sqrt{(8-1)^2 + (4-6)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 4} = \\sqrt{53} \\approx 7.2$\n3. (6, 7): Distance $\\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (7-6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 1} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.1$ (Closest candidate)\n4. (9, 3): Distance $\\sqrt{(9-1)^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 9} = \\sqrt{73} \\approx 8.5$\n5. (2, 1): Distance $\\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (1-6)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 25} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.1$ (Also closest candidate)\n\nWe are between (6, 7) (UP/RIGHT) and (2, 1) (DOWN/LEFT).\n\n**Enemy E1 Position:** Head (3, 9). Very high up.\n\n**Move Candidates from (1, 6):** Neck is (2, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (1, 7):** Safe. Moves towards (6, 7). (Distance reduced by 1 relative to (6, 7)).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 5):** Safe. Moves towards (2, 1) or the lower apples. (Distance increased by 1 relative to (2, 1)).\n3.  **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe. Moves towards (2, 1) diagonally.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 6):** Illegal. Collision with body segment (2, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT):**\n\n**1. UP (1, 7) -> Target (6, 7) distance 5.1 -> 4.1**\nThis seems like a good direct path towards (6, 7).\n*Safety Check vs E1 (3, 9):*\nE1 moves simultaneously. E1 needs to avoid hitting (1, 7) or being run into by us.\nIf E1 moves towards us, it would likely move LEFT to (2, 9) or DOWN to (3, 8). Neither move endangers (1, 7). If E1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), it's still far. UP seems very safe regarding E1.\n\n**2. DOWN (1, 5) -> Target (2, 1) distance 5.1 -> 5.4**\nThis moves away from the closest target (2, 1) mathematically, but keeps options open for the bottom half of the board.\n\n**3. LEFT (0, 6) -> Target (2, 1) distance 5.1 -> 5.0**\nThis brings us closer to the left edge and somewhat closer to (2, 1).\n\n**Priority Choice:** Moving towards the currently closest apple candidate, (6, 7), taking 1 step closer via UP, seems the most greedy and safe option.\n\nIf we go **UP (1, 7)**:\nNext turn, we are at (1, 7). Neck is (1, 6).\n*   Targets (6, 7) is now 4 steps away (if we hug the top edge: (1, 7) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) or (6, 7)). It's still a long way.\n*   If we move UP again next turn: (1, 8). Still safe.\n\nLet's check if staying low towards (2, 1) is better.\nIf we go **LEFT (0, 6)**:\nNext turn, we are at (0, 6). Neck is (1, 6).\n*   Target (2, 1) is now $\\sqrt{2^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.4$ away. (Worsened distance).\n*   If we go DOWN next turn: (0, 5). Closer path towards (2, 1) would be RIGHT later.\n\n(6, 7) is slightly further than (2, 1) based on Manhattan distance, but Euclidean suggests they are equally close ($\\sqrt{26}$). Since the board is quite open, maximizing Euclidean proximity is standard. UP gets us 1 unit closer to (6, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Pursue (6, 7) by moving UP initially, as it's the simplest immediate step toward a close target that avoids self-collision (RIGHT) and maintains good mobility. Monitor E1 movement, which appears centralized and high, posing no immediate threat to movement towards (6, 7).\n\nLONG TERM PLAN: Aim for apple (6, 7) by moving UP. If we reach (6, 7) safely, look towards the next closest, which might be (8, 4) or the bottom apples. Keep the body space open by avoiding unnecessary tight maneuvers.\n\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**",

Score: 0.\nApples (A): (8, 4), (9, 3), (2, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7).\n\nMy previous move was UP, taking me from (1, 6) to (1, 7). Wait, the state provided shows:\nTurn 7 Start Head: (1, 6). Last Move UP led to Head at (1, 7).\nThe current reported state for Turn 8 start shows: Head at (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\nThis implies that on **Turn 7**, my snake ate an apple at (1, 7) or the previous move information given is based on a partially updated state/misinterpretation.\n\nLet's reconcile the \"Last Move Information\" with the \"Current State\":\nLast Move Rationale implies: Start Turn 7 Head at (1, 6). Move UP (1, 7).\nIf the move was UP, and I ate an apple, my length would increase. If I didn't eat an apple, my tail moves up.\nThe **Current State** shows Head (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)]. Length is 4. Score is 3.\nIf the snake ate 3 apples, its natural length is $3+1=4$.\nIf the snake at start of Turn 7 was length 3 (Body length 2), and it ate on Turn 7, it would become length 4.\nStart of Turn 7 Head: (1, 6). Body implied length 3 (Score 3). Body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)]. (This body configuration doesn't match the current state body configuration at all, suggesting the state provided for the *last move rationale* was for an entirely different run or sequence of moves leading to that point, or my snake grew significantly right before Turn 7).\n\n**Crucial assumption:** I must proceed based ONLY on the **Current State provided at the top of Turn 8**, regardless of inconsistencies in the 'Last Move Information' narrative.\n\n**Current State (Turn 8 Start):**\nH0: (1, 8)\nB0: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)] (Length 4, Score 3)\nTail: (2, 6)\nNeck: (1, 7)\n\nH1: (1, 9)\nB1: [] (Length 1, Score 0)\n\nApples: A = {(8, 4), (9, 3), (2, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7)}\n\n**Targeting Strategy:**\nThe closest apple is (6, 7).\nDistance to (6, 7) from (1, 8): $\\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (7-8)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.10$.\nThe snake is currently high on the left edge. Moving towards the top right quadrant where (6, 7) resides seems sensible.\n\n**Analyzing Moves from (1, 8):**\n\nThe old tail position, which is vacated if no apple is eaten, is (2, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9):**\n    *   Self-Collision: H1 (Enemy Head) is at (1, 9). **Collision/Death (Head-Head collision).** (1, 9) is occupied by H1. Must avoid.\n\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7):**\n    *   Self-Collision: Safe. (1, 7) is occupied by B0 neck segment. Moving backwards into the neck segment is safe unless it is the *immediate* tail move for a long snake, but for this short snake moving back to the neck is fine if the tail moves out correctly, but **moving into any body segment is usually death unless rules explicitly permit moving into *only* the tail segment when it is about to vacate.** Standard rules dictate any body segment is fatal. (1, 7) is the second element of the body list, hence a body segment. **Deadly.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8):**\n    *   Self-Collision: Safe.\n    *   Bounds Check: Safe.\n    *   Enemy Collision: H1 at (1, 9). Safe.\n    *   Proximity to Apples: Distance to (6, 7) = $\\sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{26}$. No change in distance magnitude from (1, 8) vs (0, 8).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8):**\n    *   Self-Collision: Safe.\n    *   Bounds Check: Safe.\n    *   Enemy Collision: H1 at (1, 9). Safe.\n    *   Proximity to Apples: Distance to (6, 7) = $\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$. **Significantly closer to (6, 7).**\n\n**Evaluation:**\nUP kills due to H1. DOWN kills due to self-collision with body segment (1, 7).\nWe must choose between LEFT (0, 8) and RIGHT (2, 8).\n\nRIGHT (2, 8) moves us significantly closer to the target apple (6, 7) ($\\sqrt{17}$ vs $\\sqrt{26}$).\nLEFT (0, 8) moves us perpendicular to the path towards (6, 7) and keeps us close to the deadly H1 head at (1, 9) if we needed to move up later. It also potentially traps us against the left wall if we have to snake around.\n\nSince RIGHT moves towards the nearest accessible apple (6, 7) and is safe, it is the optimal choice.\n\n**Enemy Movement Check (E1 at (1, 9)):**\nWhat could H1 do? H1 is length 1.\nH1 can move to: (0, 9), (2, 9), (1, 8).\nIf H1 moves to (1, 8), it collides head-on with my previous head position IF I had moved there, but I moved away. If H1 moves to (1, 8), we are safe as my new head is at (2, 8).\nIf H1 moves to (0, 9) or (2, 9), these are safe moves for H1.\nIf H1 moves to (1, 8), H1 dies (we move to (2, 8)). If H1 moves into our new space (2, 8) -> H1 dies. H1 cannot move into (2, 8) unless that was their planned move, but they cannot predict my move.\n\nEven if H1 tries to move towards my snake, (2, 8) seems very safe from immediate counterattack by H1.\n\n**Long Term Plan Note:**\nPrimary Objective: Reach and consume apple (6, 7). Current pathfinding suggests RIGHT, then likely UP or further RIGHT depending on board layout in subsequent turns. Must be careful not to trap the snake between the growing enemy H1 and the top wall/right boundary before reaching (6, 7).\nSecondary objective: Monitor apple (8, 4) and (9, 3) if (6, 7) path becomes blocked or dangerous.\nKeep H0 away from H1's current Y-level (Y=9) if possible, as H1 is trapped there for now, but it only takes one move for H1 to potentially move away from the corner block.\n\nRIGHT",

H1 is still far from us and cannot immediately threaten us.\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (1, 9): This gets H1 back towards the center. But this means H1 moved from (0, 9) to (1, 9). This is safe for H1.\n\nSince RIGHT (3, 8) is the move that minimizes distance to the target apple (6, 7) without creating immediate self-danger, it is the best choice. We will continue to move towards (6, 7).\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving towards (6, 7) primarily using RIGHT and DOWN movements until (6, 7) is reached.
