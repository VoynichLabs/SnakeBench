To get there from (6, 6), I need to go left 2 and up 3.\n\nMoving UP would take me to (6, 7), then I could continue toward (4, 9).\nMoving LEFT would take me to (5, 6), also moving toward (4, 9).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good moves toward (4, 9).\n\nLet me think about the enemy's likely moves:\n- Enemy at (7, 1) will likely go UP to (7, 2) then RIGHT to (8, 2) to get the apple.\n- This doesn't conflict with my path.\n\nAfter getting (4, 9), I could go for (0, 9) which would be right next to me (distance 4 from (4, 9)).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. From (6, 6):\n- To (4, 9): I need to go UP 3 and LEFT 2. That's 5 moves.\n- To (8, 2): I need to go RIGHT 2 and DOWN 4. That's 6 moves, but enemy is only 2 moves away.\n\nLet me go for (4, 9) since it's my closest apple and the enemy won't contest it.\n\nFor the first move, I'll go UP to (6, 7). This keeps my options open and moves toward the apple at (4, 9).\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. Going LEFT first might be slightly better because:\n1. It moves me toward the center-left side where there are two apples at (4, 9) and (0, 9)\n2. It gives me good access to the top-left corner\n\nEither UP or LEFT is fine. I'll go UP to start moving toward (4, 9).\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n1. Move UP to (6, 7)\n2. Move UP to (6, 8)\n3. Move UP to (6, 9)\n4. Move LEFT to (5, 9)\n5. Move LEFT to (4, 9) - get apple!\n\nThen head toward (0, 9).\n\nFinal decision: UP\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (6, 6) with no body yet.\nEnemy snake is at (7, 1) with no body.\n\nLet me evaluate the apples and distances:\n- (4, 9): Distance = 5 moves (closest to me)\n- (8, 2): Distance = 6 moves (but enemy is only 2 moves away!)\n- (3, 2): Distance = 7 moves\n- (0, 9): Distance = 9 moves\n- (1, 0): Distance = 11 moves\n\nThe enemy at (7, 1) will likely grab (8, 2) since it's only 2 moves away. I shouldn't contest that.\n\nMy best target is (4, 9) - it's my closest apple and uncontested. After that, (0, 9) would be nearby.\n\nChecking all moves from (6, 6):\n- UP \u2192 (6, 7): Safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 5): Safe, but moves away from target\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 6): Safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 6): Safe, but not toward my target\n\nBoth UP and LEFT move me toward (4, 9). Going UP first keeps me in a more central position with good flexibility.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nHead to (4, 9) by going UP to reach row 9, then LEFT to column 4. After collecting that apple, sweep left to grab (0, 9). This gives me 2 apples while the enemy likely gets (8, 2).\n\nUP",

They are now just 1 move away from the apple at (8, 2). They will likely move RIGHT to grab it next turn.\n\nLet me check my possible moves from (6, 7):\n- UP: (6, 8) - safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- DOWN: (6, 6) - safe, moves away from target\n- LEFT: (5, 7) - safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- RIGHT: (7, 7) - safe, but not toward my target\n\nSince I have no body, there's no self-collision risk.

Let me consider which keeps more options open.\n\nGoing UP first takes me to (6, 8). From there I can still go in any direction.\nGoing LEFT first takes me to (5, 7). From there I can also go in any direction.\n\nBoth are fine. Following my previous plan, I'll continue with UP to (6, 8).\n\nAfter (4, 9), I should target (0, 9) which is at the same row. That's a good follow-up plan.\n\nActually, let me double-check for any collision risks:\n- Enemy is at (7, 2) and will likely move to (8, 2) to get the apple\n- No head-on collision risk since we're far apart\n\nStrategy note for future:\n1. Continue to (4, 9) - UP then LEFT movements\n2. After getting (4, 9), head to (0, 9)\n3. Then reassess based on where enemy snake is\n\nFinal decision: UP to (6, 8)\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nMy head is at (6, 7) with no body.\nEnemy snake moved from (7, 1) to (7, 2) - they're now just 1 move away from the apple at (8, 2)! They will almost certainly grab it next turn by moving RIGHT.\n\nLet me evaluate my options from (6, 7):\n- UP \u2192 (6, 8): Safe, continues toward (4, 9)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6): Safe, but moves away from targets\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7): Safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7): Safe, but not toward my goal\n\nDistance check from (6, 7):\n- (4, 9): 4 moves away (closest to me, uncontested!)\n- (0, 9): 8 moves away\n- (8, 2): 7 moves (but enemy will grab it in 1 move)\n- (3, 2): 8 moves\n- (1, 0): 12 moves\n\nMy best strategy is to continue toward (4, 9). I need to go LEFT 2 and UP 2 to reach it.\n\nThe enemy will get (8, 2), but I can get (4, 9) and then quickly grab (0, 9) on the same row. This gives me a potential 2-apple sequence while they chase other apples.\n\nNo collision risks - enemy is far away at (7, 2) heading toward (8, 2).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. UP to (6, 8) this turn\n2. UP to (6, 9) next turn\n3. LEFT to (5, 9)\n4. LEFT to (4, 9) - collect apple!\n5. Then head LEFT to (0, 9) for the second apple\n\nUP",

From there I'll have:\n- Row 9 access to both apples at (4, 9) and (0, 9)\n- After getting (4, 9), I can continue LEFT to get (0, 9)\n\nLet me double-check for head collision risks:\n- Enemy is at (7, 1)\n- If I go UP to (6, 9), I'm at y=9\n- Enemy is at y=1, very far away\n- No collision risk\n\nChecking if enemy could reach (6, 9) next turn: They're at (7, 1), to reach (6, 9) they'd need to move 1 left and 8 up in one turn - impossible. So no collision risk.\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. UP to (6, 9) this turn\n2. LEFT to (5, 9) \n3. LEFT to (4, 9) - collect apple!\n4. Continue LEFT toward (0, 9)\n5. After (0, 9), reassess - likely head down toward (1, 0) or (3, 2)\n\nThe enemy seems to be going for apples in the lower part of the board. I'll dominate the top row.\n\nFinal decision: UP\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (6, 8), enemy is at (7, 1).\n\nInteresting - the enemy moved DOWN from (7, 2) to (7, 1) rather than going for the nearby apple at (8, 2). They might be heading toward (1, 0) or (3, 2).\n\nDistance check from my position (6, 8):\n- (4, 9): 3 moves - closest!\n- (0, 9): 7 moves\n- (8, 2): 8 moves\n- (3, 2): 9 moves\n- (1, 0): 13 moves\n\nMy possible moves from (6, 8):\n- UP \u2192 (6, 9): Safe, puts me on row 9 with both top apples\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7): Safe, but moves away from targets\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8): Safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8): Safe, but wrong direction\n\nGoing UP to (6, 9) is optimal because:\n1. It positions me on the same row as two apples\n2. From (6, 9), I can reach (4, 9) in just 2 LEFT moves\n3. After getting (4, 9), I can continue left to (0, 9)\n4. The enemy is far away at y=1, no collision risk\n\nNo body to worry about, no wall risks, enemy is far away.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. UP to (6, 9) this turn \u2190\n2. LEFT to (5, 9)\n3. LEFT to (4, 9) - collect first apple!\n4. Continue LEFT: (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9) - collect second apple!\n5. Then head down toward remaining apples\n\nI can potentially grab 2 apples in the top row while the enemy competes for the lower apples.\n\nUP",

They moved DOWN again. They might be heading toward the apple at (1, 0).\n\nApples at: (1, 0), (3, 2), (8, 2), (4, 9), (0, 9)\n\nLet me calculate distances from my current position (6, 9):\n- (1, 0): |6-1| + |9-0| = 5 + 9 = 14\n- (3, 2): |6-3| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n- (8, 2): |6-8| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- (4, 9): |6-4| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2 \u2190 closest!\n- (0, 9): |6-0| + |9-9| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nI'm at row 9 now! The apple at (4, 9) is just 2 moves to the LEFT.\n\nEnemy snake at (7, 0) - let me check their distances:\n- (1, 0): |7-1| + |0-0| = 6 + 0 = 6 \u2190 they're on the same row!\n- (3, 2): |7-3| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (8, 2): |7-8| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (4, 9): |7-4| + |0-9| = 3 + 9 = 12\n- (0, 9): |7-0| + |0-9| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\nThe enemy is closest to (8, 2) at distance 3, and also close to (1, 0) at distance 6 - but they're on the same row as (1, 0)!\n\nLet me check my possible moves from (6, 9):\n- UP: (6, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! DEATH!\n- DOWN: (6, 8) - safe\n- LEFT: (5, 9) - safe, moves toward (4, 9)\n- RIGHT: (7, 9) - safe, but away from apples\n\nSo UP is eliminated - it would kill me.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\nI should continue with my plan to get the apple at (4, 9). From (6, 9):\n- LEFT to (5, 9)\n- LEFT to (4, 9) - collect apple!\n\nThen I can continue to (0, 9) for another apple.\n\nLet me check for any collision risks:\n- Enemy is at (7, 0)\n- If I go LEFT to (5, 9), I'm at y=9\n- Enemy is at y=0, very far away\n- No collision risk\n\nThe enemy could go:\n- UP to (7, 1)\n- LEFT to (6, 0)\n- RIGHT to (8, 0)\n- DOWN would be (7, -1) - off board, death\n\nSo enemy will likely go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of these bring them anywhere near me.\n\nDecision: LEFT to (5, 9), then next turn LEFT to (4, 9) to collect the apple.\n\nAfter that:\n- Continue LEFT along row 9 to get (0, 9)\n- Path: (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)\n\nStrategy:\n1. LEFT to (5, 9) this turn \u2190\n2. LEFT to (4, 9) - collect first apple!\n3. Continue LEFT: (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9) - collect second apple!\n4. Then reassess - head down toward (3, 2) or (1, 0)\n\nThe enemy seems to be in the bottom part of the board. I'll grab the top row apples and then work my way down.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nMy head is at (6, 9), enemy is at (7, 0).\n\nThe enemy moved down twice and is now at the bottom of the board at y=0, likely going for apples (1, 0) or (8, 2).\n\nLet me check my possible moves from (6, 9):\n- UP \u2192 (6, 10): OFF THE BOARD - DEATH! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8): Safe, but moves away from nearby apples\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9): Safe, moves toward apple at (4, 9)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9): Safe, but wrong direction\n\nUP is eliminated - I'm already at the top edge (y=9).\n\nDistance check:\n- (4, 9): Just 2 moves LEFT - very close!\n- (0, 9): 6 moves LEFT along the same row\n- Other apples are much farther\n\nThe optimal move is LEFT toward (4, 9). From (5, 9), I'll be just one move away from the apple.\n\nCollision risk check:\n- Enemy at (7, 0) is 9 rows below me\n- No chance of head-on collision\n- No bodies to worry about\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. LEFT to (5, 9) this turn \u2190\n2. LEFT to (4, 9) - collect first apple!\n3. Continue LEFT along row 9: (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9) - collect second apple!\n4. Then head DOWN toward remaining apples (3, 2), (1, 0), (8, 2)\n\nThis gives me a clear path to collect 2 apples while the enemy competes for the bottom apples. I should be able to gain a lead in apple count.\n\nLEFT",
