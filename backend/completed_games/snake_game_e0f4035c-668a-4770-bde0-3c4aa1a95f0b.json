My last move was UP, and I am now at (8, 6), and I want to move towards the apple at (2,5). Moving UP again from (8,6) would take me to (8,5). This is a good step toward the apple at (2,5). It keeps me away from the enemy snake at (7,3). It also doesn't put me directly against the wall.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the apple at (2,5), prioritizing a safe path.\n\nMOVE: UP",

Now I need to think about how to get closer to the apple at (6, 1) without actually moving down. I want to maintain my options open and not commit to a specific direction just yet.\n\nI could try to get to the same x-coordinate as the apple by moving down, but that's a risk - if there's another apple at a lower y-coordinate, I might be able to get it faster. However, there are already a few apples at y-coordinates below me, so it's not like I'm going to hit a giant bonanza down there.\n\nMy strategy for next turn should be to inch my head north, to (7, 3), and reassess from there. If I can get to that position, I can then consider moving right or up to get closer to the apple.\n\nHmm, how can I get to (7, 3) from here? I can move right to (9, 3)... wait, no, the board only goes up to X=9. That's not an option. Let me try again. I can move left to (7, 3)... ooh, that sounds good. Moving left makes sense.\n\nNext move: LEFT",
