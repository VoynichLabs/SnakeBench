Moving RIGHT again would suggest head going to (9,1). \n\n- The target apple is at (7,1), which is directly to the LEFT of our current head position at (8,1). Moving LEFT would get us to the apple immediately, but since our last move was RIGHT, moving LEFT would mean reversing into our own body, which is not allowed.\n\n- Moving UP or DOWN from (8,1):\n  - Moving UP to (8,2): check for obstacles:\n    - Is there an apple at (8,2)? No.\n    - Is there any snake or obstacle? No immediate threats.\n  - Moving DOWN to (8,0): check:\n    - No apple there.\n    - No obstacle.\n\n- Moving RIGHT again would go to (9,1):\n  - Is (9,1) safe? Let's see:\n    - It's within the board.\n    - No snake or apple there.\n  \n- Our last move was RIGHT to (9,1). Wait, we need to confirm: previous move was RIGHT, position was at (8,1). Now, moving RIGHT again would go to (9,1). Is that feasible? Yes, and (9,1) is not occupied.\n\n- But, checking the board:\n  - Our snake is at (8,1), with body at [(7,1)]; moving RIGHT to (9,1) would be a no, because our snake is only at (8,1), so moving RIGHT would be to (9,1), which is free.\n\n- Alternatively, since the apple is at (7,1), moving LEFT from (8,1) would directly reach the apple, but that's reversing, which is disallowed.\n\n- Moving UP or DOWN would be lateral moves, but the best move seems to be to get closer to the apple at (7,1). Since moving LEFT is invalid (reversing), the best options are:\n\n  - Moving UP to (8,2): safe, and potentially prepares to go left later to the apple.\n  - Moving DOWN to (8,0): safe but less advantageous (more distance to apple).\n\n- Let's check if moving LEFT is allowed: Our previous move was RIGHT, so moving LEFT now would be reversing into the body at (7,1). That\u2019s forbidden.\n\n- To get to the apple, we can consider moving LEFT if not reversing. Since we cannot reverse directly, we can consider maneuvering around other obstacles.\n\n- But given the current position and no immediate threats, perhaps the best move is to move UP to position (8,2).\n\n- After moving UP to (8,2), in the next turn, we can plan to move LEFT to reach the apple at (7,1).\n\n- Also, moving UP seems safe because:\n  - There are no apples or obstacles at (8,2).\n  - No walls in that direction.\n  - Enemy at (4,6) is far away.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** To reposition upward to avoid unnecessary risks, then in subsequent turns, approach the apple from the top side.\n\n**Next move: UP**\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: UP**"

The closest apple seems to be at (7,1) (though not listed precisely on the board, the apple at (9,2) is some distance away). But considering our last move to UP, we are now at (8,2).\n\nFrom (8,2):\n\n- Moving LEFT: goes to (7,2) \u2014 potential path toward the apple at (9,2) or (7,1).\n- Moving RIGHT: (9,2), which is where the apple is\u2014approaching directly, but moving RIGHT now leads us to the apple at (9,2).\n\nNote:\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (8,2): we go to (9,2)\u2014that's an apple. That seems ideal; we can eat the apple immediately, gaining points, and our snake would grow.\n\n- Moving DOWN or UP from (8,2): UP leads to (8,3), which is empty; DOWN is back to (8,1), the previous position; moving DOWN would be to (8,1), but since that's our tail and we're about to move onto it, that would be a collision if our snake is longer, but currently our snake length is 1, so moving onto its tail is acceptable only if the tail moves away simultaneously. However, to avoid unnecessary risks, moving onto tail in a single move is only safe if tail moves away the same turn, which is not indicated here; so it's safer to avoid moving into or onto tail unless we know the tail moves away.\n\nSince the apple at (9,2) is directly to the right, moving RIGHT is the best immediate move:\n\n- It results in immediate growth, no danger from walls or enemy snake because (9,2) is just within the board at x=9, y=2.\n\nLet's confirm no immediate threat:\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,2): within bounds, no walls.\n- Enemy snake at (2,7), not nearby.\n- Our own tail is at (8,1); we're moving away, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is an excellent choice to acquire the apple and grow the snake.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
