No obstacles, snakes, or my own body here.\n\nDOWN to (6, 4): Wait, that's my current position. Actually DOWN would be to (6, 3) - but I have my own body segment at (6, 3).

The enemy snake seems to be staying in the upper-right area, so (6, 5) should be safe.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (6, 5), assess whether to continue toward the apple at (4, 7) or pivot toward other apples depending on enemy snake movement.

This move directly brings us closer to the apple at (4,7). There\u2019s nothing blocking (6,7) and no enemy snake is close enough in that direction to cause immediate concern.\n\nThus, in terms of both safety and heading toward our nearest apple, moving LEFT is best.\n\nMy strategy for future turns is to steadily work toward the apple at (4,7) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake coming from below.

We\u2019re now at a state where our snake\u2019s head is at (2,7) and its body stretches out along (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) (with the tail about to be dropped from (7,7) if we don\u2019t eat an apple).\n\nThe remaining apples are at (8,0), (0,9), (0,5), (7,0), and (6,0). Notice that the \u201cleft\u2010cluster\u201d (apples at (0,9) and (0,5)) is safely away from the enemy snake (#0), which is now centered around (1,5) and the row below.\n\nFrom our current head (2,7) our possible moves (ignoring RIGHT which is blocked by our body) are:\n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (1,7)\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (2,8)\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (2,6)\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe and work toward the left-side apple cluster. However, moving LEFT directly moves our snake\u2019s head closer to column x = 0\u2014bringing us stronger into position to reach the apple at (0,9) (or later adjust to (0,5) as needed). In contrast, moving DOWN would get us closer to enemy #0\u2019s area.\n\nGiven the reasoning, the best move is to head LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
