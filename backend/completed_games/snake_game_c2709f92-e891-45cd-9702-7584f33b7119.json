          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're live, and it's time to get tactical! This is Turn 0, board is fresh, and both snakes are neck-and-neck with zero apples. I'm at (0,8), opponent is at (1,7). Board size 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. Let's break this down.\n\n**Turn 0 Plan:** First, we need to secure space and avoid getting boxed in early. My head is at (0,8) - that's the left edge, top row (since y=9 is top). Opponent is right next to me at (1,7), so they're to my right and down one. We're both small (no body yet), so we can move freely, but we need to think about where we're headed. Apples are scattered, but the enemy is the priority. We want to dominate the board, not just chase food. If I can force a head-on collision later when I have more apples, I win because we're tied now but I'll grow. But for now, safety first.\n\n**Direction Check:**  \n- **UP:** From (0,8), up would go to (0,9). That's valid (on board), no body there (I have none), and opponent's body is empty too. Safe. But y=9 is the top edge - might limit future moves.  \n- **DOWN:** To (0,7). That's on board, safe. But it's moving toward the bottom, and there's an apple at (4,8) and (7,8) nearby. Down keeps me closer to the center but away from immediate apples.  \n- **LEFT:** To (-1,8)? Wait, x=0 is the left edge, so left would go off board - DEAD. Can't do that.  \n- **RIGHT:** To (1,8). That's on board. But opponent is at (1,7) - if they move up, they could be at (1,8) too? Heads moving into same cell = both die. Risky if they go up. Also, I'd be moving toward their position, which might set up a collision.  \n\nEliminate LEFT (off board). Now compare UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple Consideration (But Not Focus):** Apples are spread out. Closest to me: (4,8) is 4 right, same y; (7,8) is 7 right; (5,0) is far down. Opponent at (1,7) is near (7,8) and (9,5) etc. But we're not chasing apples blindly - we're setting up to box opponent in. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to the center and potential apples, but so does UP (to y=9). DOWN goes away from most apples on the left side.\n\n**Enemy Awareness:** Opponent at (1,7). If I go RIGHT to (1,8), and they go UP to (1,8), we collide and both die - that's a draw, not a win (we both have 0 apples). If they go RIGHT to (2,7), we're safe. If they go DOWN to (1,6), we're safe. If they go LEFT to (0,7), they'd be right next to my new head (1,8) but not same cell. No immediate threat if I go RIGHT, but it's risky because I'm moving toward them.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0,9): Opponent could go UP to (1,8), RIGHT to (2,7), DOWN to (1,6), or LEFT to (0,7). LEFT to (0,7) would put their head at (0,7), my head at (0,9) - not same cell, safe. No immediate collision. But (0,9) is a corner - future moves limited to DOWN and RIGHT. That could trap me if opponent presses.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,7): Opponent is at (1,7) - if they go LEFT to (0,7), heads collide, both die = draw. Bad if I want to win. If they go elsewhere, safe. But (0,7) is still left edge, moving down toward bottom where apples are (like (5,0), (6,0)). Might get stuck in left column later.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:** All three (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe from immediate death. But which gives best future options?  \n- RIGHT: Opens up center access (x=1 to 9). From (1,8), I can go UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), LEFT (0,8) (back to start but that's fine), RIGHT (2,8). Multiple options. Also closer to apples like (4,8), (5,0). But risky if opponent predicts and collides.  \n- UP: (0,9) - only DOWN (0,8) and RIGHT (1,9) as safe future moves. Limited.  \n- DOWN: (0,7) - UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7). But RIGHT (1,7) might be occupied by opponent's tail next turn if they move? Actually, no, opponent moves same time. Still, from (0,7), I can go RIGHT to (1,7) only if opponent leaves, but it's a body collision risk if their body grows there later.  \n\n**Aggressive Play:** Since scores are tied (0-0), forcing a head-on collision isn't smart yet - I need to grow first. But I can't let opponent get ahead. Board domination: I'm on the left edge, opponent is just right of me. If I go RIGHT, I'm asserting presence in the center, potentially cutting off their path to left-side apples. If I go UP or DOWN, I'm staying peripheral, which might let opponent claim the middle.\n\n**Long-term Strategy (for next turn's rationale):** \"Day 1: Claim the center from the left. Use (0,8) as a base to sweep right and down, funneling opponent into corners. Monitor their head every turn - if they chase apples aggressively, intercept. Prioritize moves that leave 2+ escape routes. Grow to 1 apple first, then press for collision.\"\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT feels strongest. It's aggressive (moving toward opponent), opens board, and gets me closer to apples without committing to a edge trap. If opponent goes UP, we might collide, but that's a risk I'll take for initiative. If they move away, I'm in a better spot. Chat, we're going for the center!\n\nUP",

Opponent is at (2,7) (HEAD) with no body. Scores still 0-0. We\u2019re both small, so we can move freely, but we need to think ahead!  \n\n**Board State Update:**  \n- My head: (0,9) - top-left corner.  \n- Opponent head: (2,7) - middle-right area, eyeing nearby apples like (4,8) and (7,8).  \n- Apples: Still scattered, but I see (4,8) is close to opponent, and (5,0) is far south.  \n\n**Direction Analysis:**  \n- **UP:** From (0,9), UP goes off-board (y=10) \u2192 DEAD. Can\u2019t do that!  \n- **DOWN:** To (0,8). That\u2019s valid, safe (no body, no enemy body). Moves me away from the corner, opens up options: from (0,8), I can go DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8), or back UP (0,9) if needed. Keeps me on the left edge but avoids trapping myself.  \n- **LEFT:** Off-board (x=-1) \u2192 DEAD. No!  \n- **RIGHT:** To (1,9). That\u2019s valid, but it puts me closer to the opponent\u2019s possible path. If opponent moves UP to (2,8), we\u2019re still safe, but if they move RIGHT to (3,7), no issue. However, from (1,9), my future options are limited: UP (1,10 - dead), DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9). Still okay, but I\u2019m moving toward the center where opponent might be.  \n\n**Enemy Awareness:**  \nOpponent at (2,7) could move in many directions. If I go DOWN to (0,8), I\u2019m keeping distance. If I go RIGHT to (1,9), I\u2019m risking a head-on collision if opponent moves UP to (1,9) (but they\u2019re at (2,7), so UP would take them to (2,8), not (1,9)). Wait\u2014no, if they move LEFT to (1,7), that\u2019s fine. But moving RIGHT might align us for future clashes.  \n\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are dead.  \n\n**Aggressive Play & Strategy:**  \nWe\u2019re tied 0-0, so we don\u2019t want a collision yet. Need to grow first! Moving DOWN to (0,8) keeps me on the edge but avoids the corner trap. From there, I can swing right later or go down toward apples like (5,0). Opponent is in the center, so let them fight for those apples. I\u2019ll claim the left side and then push into the middle.  \n\n**Long-term Plan:** \u201cTurn 1: Stay safe, avoid corner. Move DOWN to (0,8) to open up downward and rightward paths. Next turn, consider swinging right to (1,8) to challenge opponent\u2019s space. Monitor opponent\u2019s moves\u2014if they go for apples aggressively, cut them off. Grow to 1 apple before forcing collisions.\u201d  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the safest move that maintains future flexibility and avoids immediate danger. Let\u2019s go!  \n\nDOWN",

TURN 2! \ud83d\udd25 Let's assess the battlefield.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   **Me (Snake 1):** Head at `(0, 8)`, Body: none, Apples: 0.\n    *   **Enemy (Snake 0):** Head at `(3, 7)`, Body: none, Apples: 0.\n    *   **Board:** 10x10 grid.\n    *   **Coordinates:** Bottom-left `(0,0)` to Top-right `(9,9)`. `UP` increases Y, `DOWN` decreases Y.\n\n2.  **EVALUATING MY MOVES FROM `(0, 8)`:**\n    *   **UP:** Target `(0, 9)`. I was there last turn. It's valid (no body, no enemy body, inside board).\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(0, 7)`. Valid (no body, no enemy body, inside board).\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(-1, 8)`. OFF-BOARD. **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(1, 8)`. Valid (no body, no enemy body, inside board).\n\n3.  **ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:**\n    *   **LEFT** is instant death. Never an option.\n\n4.  **ANALYZING SAFE MOVES (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n    *   **UP to (0,9):**\n        *   Pros: Keeps me in the corner (safe from flanks).\n        *   Cons: **BOXING MYSELF IN.** From `(0,9)`, I can only go DOWN or RIGHT. If I go UP again, I die. If I go LEFT, I die. I am trapping myself in the top-left corner. This is weak play. I need space to maneuver, especially since I have 0 apples and need to grow.\n    *   **DOWN to (0,7):**\n        *   Pros: Opens up the board. From `(0,7)`, I can go DOWN to `(0,6)` or RIGHT to `(1,7)`. This keeps me on the edge but allows me to slide down or swing out.\n        *   Cons: Still hugging the wall.\n    *   **RIGHT to (1,8):**\n        *   Pros: **ESCAPES THE CORNER.** This is crucial. From `(1,8)`, I have three options: UP `(1,9)`, DOWN `(1,7)`, or RIGHT `(2,8)`. This is maximum flexibility. It also moves me toward the center of the board and potential apples like `(2,3)`, `(3,4)`, etc. I am moving away from the enemy (who is at `(3,7)`), so no immediate collision risk.\n        *   Cons: Moving toward the center increases potential future conflict, but that's the goal\u2014to dominate space.\n\n5.  **ENEMY AWARENESS & STRATEGY:**\n    *   Enemy is at `(3, 7)`. They have open space in the middle-right.\n    *   If I stay on the left wall `(0, 7)`, I am limiting my own movement and ceding the center to the enemy.\n    *   **Aggressive Play:** To box the enemy in, I need to control space. Hugging the corner `(0,9)` or `(0,7)` is passive. Moving `RIGHT` to `(1,8)` asserts presence. It forces the enemy to respect my future movements. If I stay on the left, the enemy can sweep the right side and central apples freely.\n    *   **Growth:** There are apples at `(2,3)` and `(3,4)` which are closer if I move rightward rather than staying at `(0,7)` or `(0,9)`.\n\n6.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    *   `UP` traps me. Bad.\n    *   `DOWN` is safe but passive. Keeps me stuck on the wall.\n    *   `RIGHT` is safe, aggressive, and **EXPANDS MY TERRITORY**. It gives me more future moves. This is the winning mindset.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove `RIGHT` to `(1,8)` to escape the corner and centralize slightly. Monitor the enemy's position at `(3,7)`; if they move aggressively towards the left side, I can react. If they stay central, I'll continue sweeping right or down towards the lower-left apples to grow. Goal: Claim space, force the enemy into tight spots.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE NOT STAYING IN THE CORNER! WE ARE TAKING THE BOARD!**\n\nRIGHT",

TURN 3 IS HERE! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down this board and make the enemy regret ever crossing us.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n   * **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(1, 8)`, Body: none. Safe and sound.\n   * **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(3, 8)`, Body: none. This is CRUCIAL info! We are in the same row (y=8).\n   * **Enemy Position:** They are at `(3, 8)`. I am at `(1, 8)`. There is an Apple at `(4, 8)` on the same row. The enemy is closer to that apple (distance 1 vs my distance 3).\n   * **Potential Threat:** If the enemy moves RIGHT to `(4, 8)` to eat the apple, their head will be at `(4, 8)`. If I move RIGHT to `(2, 8)` and then `(3, 8)`, I risk a head-on collision if I go `RIGHT` again and they don't move. However, since they are likely chasing that apple, they will be moving away from me if they go `RIGHT`.\n\n2. **EVALUATING MY MOVES FROM `(1, 8)`:**\n   * **UP:** Target `(1, 9)`. Valid (inside board). Opens up the top edge but limits vertical space immediately. Not great for expansion.\n   * **DOWN:** Target `(1, 7)`. Valid. Moves me away from the enemy row. Safe, but passive. Lets the enemy take the row.\n   * **LEFT:** Target `(0, 8)`. Valid. Moves me back to the left wall. Passive. Boxed in.\n   * **RIGHT:** Target `(2, 8)`. Valid. **TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION.** This moves me toward the center of the row. It forces the enemy to acknowledge my presence.\n\n3. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS (BOXING HIM IN):**\n   * The enemy is at `(3, 8)`. If I move `RIGHT` to `(2, 8)`, I am stepping into their space.\n   * What if the enemy moves `UP` or `DOWN`?\n     * If Enemy moves `UP` to `(3, 9)` or `DOWN` to `(3, 7)`, I am safe at `(2, 8)` and I claim the row.\n     * If Enemy moves `LEFT` to `(2, 8)`... HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die. Since I have 0 apples and they have 0 apples, it's a draw. BUT, if I eat an apple this turn or next, I win the collision. I haven't eaten yet.\n     * If Enemy moves `RIGHT` to `(4, 8)` (likely for the apple), we are separated by distance. I own `(2, 8)`.\n   * **The \"Box In\" Strategy:** By moving `RIGHT`, I am taking territory. The enemy is pinned between my potential future moves and the right wall (or the edge). If I continue to push right while staying on the row, I can force them to retreat or risk collision.\n   * **Apple Awareness:** There is an apple at `(4, 8)`. The enemy is closer. If I move `RIGHT`, I am setting up to maybe contest the *next* apple or simply cut off their retreat.\n\n4. **ELIMINATING WEAK MOVES:**\n   * `UP` / `DOWN` / `LEFT` all move me away from the action and the enemy. To dominate, I must pressure the opponent. Staying on the edge is weak play.\n\n5. **FINAL DECISION:**\n   * **RIGHT** is the only aggressive option. It claims space (`(2, 8)`), keeps options open (UP, DOWN, RIGHT from there), and puts pressure on the enemy who is sharing my row.\n   * I am not moving into the apple yet (enemy is closer), but I am securing the lane. If the enemy eats the apple at `(4, 8)` and grows, a head-on collision becomes more dangerous for me unless I eat soon. I need to watch their next move closely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the row. Force the enemy to move up or down. If they stay on the row, we collide. If they move off, I sweep the apples on this row or swing down to the cluster at `(2, 3), (3, 4)`. Do not let him breathe.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE TAKING THIS ROW! WATCH HIM SQUIRM!**\n\nRIGHT",

Pushing right keeps you on a clean horizontal track toward that apple and opens multiple safe follow-ups.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTES:\n- Immediate move: go RIGHT to (5,8). This preserves options, keeps space from the opponent, and lines you up to chase the row-8 apple.\n- Next turns: if safe, continue RIGHT to (6,8) toward (7,8); alternatively, if the moment is right, shift UP to threaten a top-row squeeze while keeping movement options open.\n- Long-term aim: accumulate apples (you\u2019re up 1 vs 0) and pressure the board so the opponent has fewer safe routes, aiming for a potential head-on collision only if it\u2019s favorable.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Move to (5,8) now.\n- If the window opens, push toward (7,8) for the next apple; otherwise, transition to a controlled mix of RIGHT and UP to start boxing toward the top-right quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is at `(4, 8)` now, moving away from us because they grabbed that apple at `(4, 8)`. They just grew to 2 segments, so their body is now at `(3, 8)` and tail at `(3, 8)`? Wait, actually they started at `(4, 8)` head and body `[(3, 8)]`. If they moved Right to `(5, 8)` or whatever, but the board shows they were at `(4, 8)` after the move? Let me check the board state carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 8: `. . 1 T 0 . . A . .`\nCoordinates: x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9 (bottom-left to top-right).\nWait, the board display is usually rows from top to bottom?

That matches (0,0) bottom-left.\nWait, \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head...\".\nMy head was at `(2, 8)`. The board shows `1` at row 8, column 2. Yes.\nEnemy head was at `(4, 8)`. The board shows `0` at row 8, column 4. Yes.\nEnemy body `[(3, 8)]` (the tail?) No, the list is head-to-tail. If head is `(4, 8)`, body list is `[(3, 8)]`. That means the segment behind the head is at `(3, 8)`. But wait, the board shows `T` at row 8, column 3. `T` usually denotes Tail.\nSo Enemy snake: Head `(4, 8)` (marked `0`), Body `[(3, 8)]` (marked `T`).\nThey ate an apple last turn? They had 1 apple already. They are at `(4, 8)`. There is an apple at `(4, 8)` in the Apple Drops list? The list includes `(9, 5), (5, 0)... (8, 0)...` Let's check `(4, 8)`.\nApple drops list: `(9, 5), (5, 0), (8, 2), (7, 8), (3, 4), (6, 0), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (7, 6), (8, 0), (7, 7), (9, 4), (1, 5), (9, 3)`.\nThere is NO apple at `(4, 8)`. The apples visible on the board are at `(8, 5)`, `(7, 6)`, `(7, 7)`, `(7, 8)`, `(9, 5)`, `(8, 4)`, `(9, 4)`, `(9, 3)`, `(8, 2)`, `(8, 1)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 0)`, `(7, 0)`... wait.\nRow 5: `. A . . . . . . . A` -> `(1, 5)` and `(9, 5)`. Correct.\nRow 8: `. . 1 T 0 . . A . .` -> `(7, 8)` is an apple. Correct.\nEnemy is at `(4, 8)`. No apple there. Why did they move there?\nMaybe they are just moving? Or maybe I misread the apple list.\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: `. . 1 T 0 . . A . .`\nx: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy head at x=2. Enemy head at x=4. Apple at x=7.\nEnemy body at x=3 (T).\nSo Enemy moved Right from `(3, 8)` to `(4, 8)`? Or maybe they moved Left from `(5, 8)`?\nPrevious state: My head `(2, 8)`. Enemy head `(4, 8)`. Body `[(3, 8)]`.\nWait, the prompt says: \"Turn: 4 / 150\". And \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (2, 8)\".\n\"OPPONENTS: * Snake #0 - Head: (4, 8), Body: [(3, 8)], Apples: 1\".\nSo at the start of Turn 4, Enemy is at `(4, 8)`.\nThe board shows `0` at `(4, 8)`. Yes.\nThe apple at `(7, 8)` is there. Enemy is chasing it? They moved away from it? `(3, 8)` to `(4, 8)` is Right.\n`(3, 8)` is to the Left of `(4, 8)`.\nSo Enemy moved Right.\nWhy? Maybe they thought I was coming from the left? I was at `(1, 8)`. I moved Right to `(2, 8)`.\nSo Enemy saw me at `(1, 8)` and moved Right? Or maybe they just picked a direction.\nActually, let's look at the board.\nMy head `(2, 8)`.\nEnemy head `(4, 8)`.\nDistance between us is 2 cells.\nApple at `(7, 8)`.\nThere is also an apple at `(8, 2)`, `(7, 6)`, etc.\n\nMy turn now. I am at `(2, 8)`.\nPossible moves: UP `(2, 9)`, DOWN `(2, 7)`, LEFT `(1, 8)`, RIGHT `(3, 8)`.\nCheck safety:\n- `(2, 9)`: Valid. Row 9 is all dots.\n- `(2, 7)`: Valid. Row 7 is `. . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at 7,7). `(2, 7)` is empty.\n- `(1, 8)`: Valid. Empty.\n- `(3, 8)`: This is where the Enemy's tail is? No, Enemy body is `[(3, 8)]`. That's a body segment. If I move to `(3, 8)`, I die. So RIGHT is DEATH.\n\nWait, Enemy body is `[(3, 8)]`. The tail is usually the last element of the body list. The prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\nSo if Head is `(4, 8)` and Body is `[(3, 8)]`, then the body segment is at `(3, 8)` and that is the tail (since it's the only body part).\nSo moving to `(3, 8)` hits the enemy body. DEATH.\nAlso, if Enemy moves Left to `(3, 8)` and I move Right to `(3, 8)`, we collide head-to-head? No, he moves into a cell I am moving into.\nBut if I just move into his body, I die.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow consider LEFT `(1, 8)`.\nI just came from `(1, 8)`? No, I was at `(1, 8)` last turn? Wait.\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK RIGHT\". I moved from `(1, 8)` to `(2, 8)`.\nSo `(1, 8)` is empty (unless I left a tail there).\nMy snake length is 1 (no body). So I don't hit myself.\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nConsider UP `(2, 9)`.\nSafe.\n\nConsider DOWN `(2, 7)`.\nSafe.\n\nSo options: UP, DOWN, LEFT. (RIGHT is blocked by enemy body).\n\nWhere is the enemy likely to go?\nEnemy at `(4, 8)`.\nPossible moves for enemy: UP `(4, 9)`, DOWN `(4, 7)`, LEFT `(3, 8)` (his own body? No, body is at `(3, 8)`. If he moves Left to `(3, 8)`, he hits his own tail? Wait.\nSnake #0: Head `(4, 8)`, Body `[(3, 8)]`.\nIf he moves Left to `(3, 8)`, that cell is currently occupied by his tail.\nSince he is length 2 (1 apple + 1 initial length?), usually length starts at 1? No, usually snakes start with length 1 or 2. \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL\". He has Head and Body. So length is at least 2.\nIf he moves Left, he enters his tail's old position.\nIn standard snake rules, moving into your own tail is usually safe because the tail moves away. BUT the prompt says: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\nMoving into the tail is safe. Moving into the segment *behind* the head (if length > 2) is unsafe.\nHere, length is 2. The only body part is the tail. So moving into `(3, 8)` is safe for him.\nHowever, if I move Right to `(3, 8)` and he moves Left to `(3, 8)`, we collide. HEAD-ON COLLISION. We both die.\nSince I have 0 apples and he has 1, if we collide, he wins (1 > 0).\nSo I must avoid head-on collision where I lose.\n\nWhat are his other options?\nUP `(4, 9)`: Safe.\nDOWN `(4, 7)`: Safe. There is an apple at `(7, 7)`. Down gets him closer to that?\nRIGHT `(5, 8)`: Safe. There is an apple at `(7, 8)`. Right gets him closer to `(7, 8)`.\nBut he is blocked by wall? No, x=5 is valid.\n\nMy strategy:\nI want to box him in. I am at `(2, 8)`. He is at `(4, 8)`.\nIf I move LEFT `(1, 8)`, I give up ground. Not good.\nIf I move UP `(2, 9)`, I move to the top wall. Limited space.\nIf I move DOWN `(2, 7)`, I move into the center of the board. This opens up more space.\n\nThe apple at `(7, 8)` is valuable.\nIf I move DOWN to `(2, 7)`, I can then move RIGHT towards `(7, 7)` or `(7, 6)`.\nWait, let's look at the apple list again.\nApples: `(9, 5), (5, 0), (8, 2), (7, 8), (3, 4), (6, 0), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (7, 6), (8, 0), (7, 7), (9, 4), (1, 5), (9, 3)`.\nThere are apples at `(7, 8)`, `(7, 7)`, `(7, 6)`.\nThis is a dense cluster of apples at x=7, y=6,7,8.\nEnemy is at `(4, 8)`. He is closer to `(7, 8)` than I am.\nI am at `(2, 8)`.\nDistance to `(7, 8)`:\nEnemy: `|7-4| = 3`.\nMe: `|7-2| = 5`.\nEnemy is closer. He will likely go for `(7, 8)`.\nIf he goes for `(7, 8)`, he will move Right.\nIf he moves Right to `(5, 8)`, and I move Right to `(3, 8)`, I die (hit body).\nSo I cannot intercept him on the row y=8.\n\nWhat if I move DOWN?\nIf I move DOWN to `(2, 7)`, I am on the same row as the apple at `(7, 7)`.\nDistance to `(7, 7)`:\nMe from `(2, 7)`: `|7-2| + |7-7| = 5`.\nEnemy from `(4, 8)`: `|7-4| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nEnemy is still closer to `(7, 7)` than I am to `(7, 7)`? No, I am 5 away, he is 4 away. He is closer.\nWait, he is at y=8. To get to y=7, he needs to move Down.\nIf he moves Down to `(4, 7)`, his distance to `(7, 7)` becomes 3.\nIf I move Down to `(2, 7)`, my distance is 5.\nHe is winning the race to the cluster.\n\nHowever, the goal is to box him in.\nIf I move DOWN, I open up the bottom half of the board.\nIf I stay UP, I am stuck in the top row with him.\nTop row (y=9) is small (10 cells).\nIf I go UP `(2, 9)`:\nI am at `(2, 9)`. Enemy is at `(4, 8)`.\nIf Enemy goes UP `(4, 9)`, he is on the top row with me.\nIf he stays on the top row, we might collide eventually.\nBut if he goes DOWN, he takes the whole board.\nI should chase him. I should go DOWN.\n\nAlso, consider the apple at `(2, 3)`.\nFrom `(2, 7)`, that's distance 4.\nFrom `(2, 8)`, that's distance 5.\nGoing Down is closer to `(2, 3)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the threats.\nIf I go DOWN `(2, 7)`:\n- Safe from board edges.\n- Safe from my own body.\n- Safe from enemy body (at `(3, 8)` and `(4, 8)`).\n- Potential head-on collision?\n  - If Enemy goes LEFT `(3, 8)` and I go... I didn't go Right. No collision.\n  - If Enemy goes DOWN `(4, 7)` and I go DOWN `(2, 7)`. No collision.\n  - If Enemy goes DOWN-LEFT diagonal? No, simultaneous turns.\n  - If Enemy goes DOWN `(4, 7)` and I go DOWN `(2, 7)`. We are on y=7. He is at x=4, I am at x=2.\n  - Next turn, if he goes LEFT `(3, 7)` and I go RIGHT `(3, 7)`. That would be a collision.\n  - I need to watch out for that.\n\nIf I go UP `(2, 9)`:\n- I am on the top row.\n- Enemy might come up. If he comes up `(4, 9)`, distance is 2.\n- If he stays down, I am isolated.\n- Top row is a trap if the enemy controls the access point (y=8).\n\nIf I go LEFT `(1, 8)`:\n- Passive. Giving up the center.\n- Enemy moves to `(5, 8)` (towards apple). I am left behind.\n\nDecision:\nGoing DOWN seems best. It keeps me connected to the lower apples `(7, 6), (7, 7), (3, 4), (2, 3)`.\nThe apple at `(7, 8)` is likely going to the enemy.\nIf enemy takes `(7, 8)`, he grows. He becomes longer.\nIf I don't grow, he wins a head-on collision.\nI MUST eat an apple soon.\nThere is an apple at `(8, 2)`. Distance from `(2, 7)` is `|8-2| + |2-7| = 6 + 5 = 11`.\nThere is an apple at `(2, 3)`. Distance from `(2, 7)` is `|2-2| + |3-7| = 4`.\nThere is an apple at `(3, 4)`. Distance from `(2, 7)` is `|3-2| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4`.\nThere is an apple at `(7, 6)`. Distance from `(2, 7)` is `|7-2| + |6-7| = 5 + 1 = 6`.\nThere is an apple at `(7, 7)`. Distance is 5.\nThere is an apple at `(8, 1)`. Distance is `|8-2| + |1-7| = 6 + 6 = 12`.\nThere is an apple at `(4, 1)`. Distance is `|4-2| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8`.\nThere is an apple at `(5, 0)`. Distance is `|5-2| + |0-7| = 3 + 7 = 10`.\nThere is an apple at `(6, 0)`. Distance is `|6-2| + |0-7| = 4 + 7 = 11`.\nThere is an apple at `(8, 0)`. Distance is `|8-2| + |0-7| = 6 + 7 = 13`.\n\nThe closest apple is `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)`.\nGoing DOWN `(2, 7)` puts me on the path to `(2, 3)` (straight down the column).\nIt also puts me on the path to `(3, 4)` (diagonal).\n\nLet's check safety of DOWN `(2, 7)` again.\nIs there any apple at `(2, 7)`? No.\nIs `(2, 7)` occupied? Board shows Row 7: `. . . . . . . A . .`. x=2 is empty.\nIs `(2, 7)` blocked by enemy?\nEnemy is at `(4, 8)` and `(3, 8)`.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to `(4, 7)`, he is safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to `(4, 7)`, and I move DOWN to `(2, 7)`.\nNext turn:\nEnemy at `(4, 7)`, I at `(2, 7)`.\nIf enemy moves LEFT `(3, 7)`, and I move RIGHT `(3, 7)`, we collide.\nIf enemy moves LEFT `(3, 7)`, he might want to go to `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)` too.\nActually, if enemy is at `(4, 7)` and I am at `(2, 7)`, and he moves LEFT to `(3, 7)`.\nI am at `(2, 7)`. If I move RIGHT to `(3, 7)`, we die.\nIf I move DOWN to `(2, 6)`, I survive.\nSo I just have to avoid moving into him.\n\nWhat if enemy moves UP `(4, 9)`?\nThen he is on the top row. I am at `(2, 7)`.\nWe are separated.\nIf he stays UP, I take the bottom.\nIf he moves DOWN later, I have a head start.\n\nWhat if enemy moves RIGHT `(5, 8)` to chase `(7, 8)`?\nThen I am at `(2, 7)`.\nDistance to `(7, 8)` for me: `|7-2| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6`.\nDistance for him: `|7-5| + |8-8| = 2`.\nHe will get it.\nIf he eats `(7, 8)`, he grows.\nI need to eat something fast.\n`(2, 3)` is 4 moves away from `(2, 7)`.\n`(3, 4)` is 4 moves away from `(2, 7)`.\nIf I go DOWN now, I am on the path.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nTop row (y=9) has no apples.\nTop row is a dead end (literally).\nGoing UP traps me in a 10x1 space.\nGoing DOWN opens up the rest of the board (9x10 space).\nSo UP is bad.\n\nIs there any reason to go LEFT?\n`(1, 8)` leads to `(0, 8)`. Left wall.\nThen I have to turn DOWN anyway.\nGoing DOWN directly from `(2, 8)` is more direct to the apple at `(2, 3)`.\n\nSo the choice is between DOWN and LEFT (and UP is bad).\nLEFT is just stalling.\nDOWN is advancing towards the objective.\n\nLet's double check the board for Row 7 at x=2.\n```\n 7 . . . . . . . A . .\n```\nx=0 to 9.\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: . (Empty)\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: A\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\nSo `(2, 7)` is empty.\n\nWhat about Row 6?\n```\n 6 . . . . . . .

No, I have no tail. I just leave the cell).\nMy body remains empty.\nSo I leave `(2, 8)`.\nThe enemy is at `(4, 8)` and `(3, 8)`.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to `(3, 8)` (into his own tail), the cell `(4, 8)` becomes empty.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to `(5, 8)`, `(3, 8)` becomes empty (tail moves).\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to `(4, 7)`.\nHe is at `(4, 7)`.\nI am at `(2, 7)`.\nWe are on the same row, separated by 2 cells (`(3, 7)` is empty).\nThis is fine.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to `(4, 9)`.\nHe is at `(4, 9)`.\nI am at `(2, 7)`.\nSafe distance.\n\nSo DOWN `(2, 7)` is safe and strategic.\n\nRationale for Chat:\n\"We are at `(2, 8)`. Enemy is at `(4, 8)`. He is blocking the path to the right-side apples on row 8. I cannot beat him to `(7, 8)` if he goes for it. The top row (y=9) is a trap. I need to secure the lower board. Going DOWN to `(2, 7)` puts me on the path to the apple cluster at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 4)`. It also gives me access to `(7, 6)` and `(7, 7)`. I am cutting off his potential retreat to the bottom if he stays high, or I am racing him to the bottom if he goes high. Let's take the initiative.\"\n\nPlan for next turn:\n\"Plan: Secure the central area. Watch enemy movement. If he goes for `(7, 8)`, I'll go for `(3, 4)` or `(2, 3)`. If he comes down, I need to prepare to box him in or race for food.\"\n\nFinal check: Is `(2, 7)` safe?\nYes.\nIs `(2, 7)` a good move?\nYes, compared to UP (trap) and LEFT (retreat).\nRIGHT is death.\nDOWN is the only aggressive/forward move.\n\nOne detail: The apple at `(1, 5)`.\nFrom `(2, 7)`, distance is `|1-2| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3`.\nFrom `(2, 8)`, distance is `|1-2| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4`.\nGoing DOWN gets me closer to `(1, 5)` as well.\nSo DOWN is good.\n\nLet's write the output.\n\n```text\nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT!

A`.\nx=1 is an apple.\nYes.\nGoing DOWN gets me closer to (1, 5).\nExcellent.\n\nThe plan seems solid.\nI am avoiding the trap (top row).\nI am moving towards food.\nI am moving away from the enemy who has an apple advantage.\nI am opening up my movement options.\n\nFinal check on the \"Box him in\" instruction.\nBy moving DOWN, I am not boxing him in immediately.\nBut by taking the space, I prevent him from taking it.\nIf he goes to the top row, he is boxed in by the wall.\nIf he comes down, I have the center.\nIt's a strategy.\n\nLet's go.\n\nOne tiny detail: The prompt says \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\".\nDoes \"Box him in\" mean physically trapping him so he has no moves?\nOr does it mean restricting his territory?\nIn Snake, physically trapping a snake is hard early game.\nRestricting territory is easier.\nBy moving DOWN, I am claiming the bottom 6 rows (y=0 to y=6).\nHe is left with y=7 to y=9? No, he is at y=8.\nIf I take (2, 7), he might take (5, 8) or (4, 9).\nIf he takes (4, 9), he has y=7, 8, 9 available (3 rows).\nIf he takes (5, 8), he has access to y=7 and y=9.\nSo I am giving him 3 rows, I take 7 rows? No, I take 7 rows (0-6) plus (2,7)? No, I am at (2, 7).\nI am on the boundary.\nI am claiming the space *below* me.\nHe is above me.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 7), and he moves DOWN to (4, 7), we are on the same row.\nThen I am boxing him in on the row? No, there is space to go around.\nBut if I stay on (2, 7) and he stays on (4, 7), we are parallel.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7) and he moves LEFT to (3, 7), we crash.\nI need to be careful.\n\nActually, moving DOWN is good because it allows me to eventually circle around if I get long enough.\nFor now, (2, 7) is the best move.\n\nLet's write the response.\n\n```text\nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT!

SAFE OPTIONS THIS TURN: UP -> (5,9), DOWN -> (5,7), RIGHT -> (6,8). LEFT would crash into your own neck, so it\u2019s OUT.\n- OPPONENT: Snake #1 is at (2,7) with no body right now, so there\u2019s no immediate trap on our tail this turn.\n- OBJECTIVE: SURGE offensively, close on the row-8 apple at (7,8), and pressure space on the board so he\u2019s got fewer safe routes. Score is 1-0 in our favor, so we want to extend that lead and look for a potential head-on if it\u2019s favorable.\n- WHY RIGHT: Moving RIGHT keeps us aligned with the row-8 apple and preserves multiple safe follow-ups (continue RIGHT, or pop UP if space tightens). UP would push us toward the top edge and may limit future options; DOWN risks losing the top-right quadrant control and gives him more room to maneuver.\n\nMOVE DECISION:\n- Short-term plan: RIGHT to (6,8) now. This keeps the apple in reach at (7,8) and sets up a direct push toward the apple on the next turn.\n- If (7,8) is safe to eat next turn, go RIGHT to (7,8) and grow. If not, pivot to UP to (6,9) or continue RIGHT along the 8th row to (8,8) depending on how he shifts.\n- Long-term: maintain the pressure on the top-right area, using apples to widen your lead, and box him in when you have a clear advantage to force dangerous head-ons only on favorable terms.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW MOVES:\n- Keep your path along the 8th row toward the apple at (7,8).\n- Watch for his possible rough lines, but with you ahead in apples, aim to force him into tighter spaces and set up a head-on only if it\u2019s advantageous.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! TURN 6! \ud83d\udd25 We're still at `(1, 7)` after that LEFT move. Let's break down the battlefield. The enemy at `(6, 8)` is lurking in the top-right corner with his body at `(5, 8)`. He's got 1 apple, we have 0. We need to get on the board and catch up, but more importantly, we need to set up a trap.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples scattered everywhere. But we gotta watch our opponent. He's going to be hungry too. Where's he likely to go? He could go LEFT towards `(5, 8)` (wait, that's his tail, he can't go left), he could go UP to `(6, 9)`, DOWN to `(6, 7)`, or RIGHT to `(7, 8)`. If he goes DOWN, he's approaching our line. If he goes UP, he's cornering himself.\n\nWe need to secure the left side. We are at `(1, 7)`. Options:\n1.  **LEFT**: To `(0, 7)`. This pushes us into the left edge. We open up `(0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 6), (1, 8)` for next turn. There's an apple at `(2, 3)` and `(1, 5)` we can access later.\n2.  **RIGHT**: To `(2, 7)`. This brings us back to the center. Risky if the enemy moves DOWN.\n3.  **DOWN**: To `(1, 6)`. Moves us away from the enemy (who is at y=8). Safe.\n4.  **UP**: To `(1, 8)`. Moves us up. There's an apple at `(1, 5)` below us, and an apple at `(2, 3)` further down. Going UP might trap us in the corner if the enemy pushes left. But there's also an apple at `(1, 5)`? Wait, looking at the board:\n    ```\n     9 . . . . . . . . . .\n     8 . . . . . T 0 A . .\n     7 . 1 . . . . . A . .\n     6 . . . . . . . A . .\n     5 . A . . . . . . . A\n    ```\n    If I go UP to `(1, 8)`, I'm next to the enemy's potential path. But `(1, 8)` is empty. However, `(1, 5)` is an apple. `(2, 3)` is an apple. If I go UP, I'm moving away from the cluster at `(2, 3)` and `(1, 5)`.\n\n    Let's look at the apples on the left side.\n    `(2, 3)` is available.\n    `(1, 5)` is available.\n    `(3, 4)` is available.\n\n    If I go **LEFT** to `(0, 7)`, I open up the bottom left corridor. This seems like a good strategic move to claim territory.\n    If I go **DOWN** to `(1, 6)`, I'm closer to the `(1, 5)` apple.\n    If I go **LEFT** to `(0, 7)`, I can go DOWN to `(0, 6)` next turn.\n\n    Let's check for immediate death:\n    *   LEFT to `(0, 7)`: On board. Not my body (empty). Enemy body is at `(5, 8)` and `(6, 8)` head. Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to `(2, 7)`: On board. Not my body. Safe, but might be dangerous if enemy moves DOWN to `(6, 7)`? No, that's far. But `$(2, 7)` is empty.\n    *   DOWN to `(1, 6)`: On board. Empty.\n    *   UP to `(1, 8)`: On board. Empty.\n\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`. He is unlikely to reach me this turn. I have time.\n    Strategy: Claim the left wall. Box him in on the right.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I control the left edge. From there I can go DOWN to `(0, 6)` or `(0, 5)` eventually. There is an apple at `(8, 0)` on the bottom right, far away. `(1, 5)` is closer. `(2, 3)` is closer.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    ```\n     8 . . . . . T 0 A . .\n     7 . 1 . . . . . A . .\n    ```\n    Enemy head `0` at `(6, 8)`, body `T` at `(5, 8)`.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am safe.\n    If I go UP to `(1, 8)`, I am at `(1, 8)`. This puts me in the top row, near the edge. The apple at `(1, 5)` is down there.\n    \n    Actually, looking at `(1, 5)`. I am at `(1, 7)`. If I go DOWN twice, I can eat that apple.\n    If I go LEFT, I go to `(0, 7)`. From there I can go DOWN to `(0, 6)`. Then `(0, 5)`.\n    \n    The apples on the left are:\n    (1, 5) - Directly below us by 2 moves.\n    (2, 3) - Diagonal.\n    (3, 4) - Diagonal.\n    (5, 0) - Bottom.\n    (6, 0) - Bottom.\n    (8, 0) - Bottom.\n    \n    The enemy is in the top right. He wants to go down to eat apples too.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am on the edge. I can sweep the edge safely.\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am moving towards the `(1, 5)` apple.\n    \n    Let's check for traps.\n    If I go LEFT `(0, 7)`: Next turn I can go DOWN `(0, 6)`, DOWN `(0, 5)`, RIGHT `(1, 5)` (apple!), or UP `(0, 8)`.\n    If I go DOWN `(1, 6)`: Next turn I can go LEFT `(0, 6)`, DOWN `(1, 5)` (apple!), RIGHT `(2, 6)`, or UP `(1, 7)`.\n    \n    Both are safe.\n    However, if I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am getting closer to the apple at `(1, 5)`.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am moving away from `(1, 5)`.\n    \n    Is `(1, 5)` safe? Looking at the board, there are no snakes nearby except the enemy in the top right.\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`. To get to `(1, 5)`, he would have to travel across the board. I am closer.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am \"showing aggression\" by moving toward the center bottom?\n    No, I am just moving down.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the \"Box him in\" strategy.\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`. If I move to `(0, 7)`, I am occupying the far left. This forces him to stick to the right side.\n    If I move DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am still central.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Board State\" text representation again:\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . . T 0 A . .`\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    \n    The apple at `(7, 8)` is next to the enemy.\n    The apple at `(9, 5)` is far right.\n    The apple at `(5, 0)` is bottom middle.\n    \n    I want to secure the left side.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am safe.\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am safe.\n    \n    The user prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\n    To box him in, I need to take territory.\n    The left side is open.\n    The bottom is open.\n    The top is open (mostly).\n    \n    If I go UP to `(1, 8)`, I am in the top row. This puts me in a \"head to head\" potential with the enemy if he goes down, but he is far away. `(1, 8)` is empty.\n    \n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    `(1, 5)` is very close.\n    `(2, 3)` is close.\n    `(3, 4)` is close.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am setting up to eat `(1, 5)` on turn 8.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am setting up to eat `(1, 5)` on turn 9.\n    \n    Speed matters. I need apples to catch up (0 vs 1).\n    Going DOWN seems faster to the apples.\n    \n    However, the board is 10x10.\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am still relatively central.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am on the edge. Edges are safer because you have fewer directions to worry about (can't go off the board on the left).\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy again. `(6, 8)`.\n    If he moves DOWN, he goes to `(6, 7)`.\n    If he moves LEFT, he goes to `(5, 8)` (his body, so he dies). So he won't go LEFT.\n    If he moves UP, he goes to `(6, 9)`.\n    If he moves RIGHT, he goes to `(7, 8)`.\n    \n    So he has 3 options.\n    \n    My move: DOWN to `(1, 6)`.\n    Next turn I can go DOWN to `(1, 5)` (Apple). That's a guaranteed point if I survive.\n    Is `(1, 5)` safe? Yes, enemy is far.\n    \n    My move: LEFT to `(0, 7)`.\n    Next turn I can go DOWN to `(0, 6)`.\n    Then DOWN to `(0, 5)`.\n    Then RIGHT to `(1, 5)`.\n    This is 3 turns to the apple.\n    \n    My move: DOWN to `(1, 6)`.\n    Next turn DOWN to `(1, 5)` (Apple). 1 turn to the apple.\n    \n    Speed is key. I am behind 0-1.\n    I should take the fastest route to an apple while maintaining safety.\n    The apple at `(1, 5)` is the closest safe apple.\n    The apple at `(2, 3)` is further (4 moves).\n    The apple at `(3, 4)` is further (3 moves).\n    \n    So, moving DOWN to `(1, 6)` is the optimal play to get an apple.\n    Is it safe from the enemy this turn?\n    Enemy at `(6, 8)`. Distance to `(1, 6)` is huge. He cannot kill me this turn.\n    \n    Are there any other threats?\n    My body is empty. So no self-collision.\n    Board bounds: `(1, 6)` is valid.\n    \n    Is there a risk of being trapped later?\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am opening up the left side? No, I am staying in the center-left.\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I can still go LEFT to `(0, 6)` next turn if needed.\n    \n    Let's check the board state again for obstacles.\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    `6 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    `5 . A . . . . . . . A`\n    \n    At `(1, 6)`: empty.\n    \n    Let's compare `DOWN` vs `LEFT`.\n    `DOWN` leads to `(1, 6)` -> `(1, 5)` (Apple).\n    `LEFT` leads to `(0, 7)` -> `(0, 6)` -> `(0, 5)` -> `(1, 5)` (Apple).\n    \n    `DOWN` is clearly faster.\n    However, `LEFT` puts me on the edge, which is often safer in the long run.\n    But I need apples NOW. I can't afford to be slow.\n    \n    What if the enemy moves to intercept?\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`. He wants apples too.\n    Apples near him: `(7, 8)`, `(8, 2)`, `(9, 5)`, `(7, 6)`, `(8, 0)`, `(7, 7)`, `(9, 4)`, `(9, 3)`.\n    He has plenty of apples on the right side.\n    He will likely stay on the right side.\n    I will take the left side.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am claiming the left-center.\n    If I go LEFT to `(0, 7)`, I am claiming the far left.\n    \n    The apple at `(1, 5)` is valuable. If I go LEFT, I delay getting it.\n    If I go DOWN, I get it in 2 turns.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Box him in\" instruction.\n    If I hug the left wall, I restrict my own movement slightly, but I also make it hard for him to cross over to my side without dying.\n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am more mobile.\n    \n    Actually, looking at the board, there is an apple at `(2, 3)`.\n    If I am at `(1, 6)`, I can go `(1, 5)` (Apple) -> `(1, 4)` -> `(2, 4)` -> `(2, 3)` (Apple).\n    That's a nice route.\n    \n    If I am at `(0, 7)`, I can go `(0, 6)` -> `(0, 5)` -> `(1, 5)` (Apple).\n    \n    The `(1, 5)` apple is the key. It's directly south of my start.\n    I should prioritize it.\n    \n    Is there any reason NOT to go DOWN?\n    `(1, 6)` is empty.\n    Enemy can't reach me.\n    \n    Let's consider the psychological aspect (the streamer persona).\n    \"Be aggressive\".\n    Moving DOWN towards the center of the board is more aggressive than hiding on the edge.\n    Moving DOWN also moves me closer to the bottom row apples eventually.\n    \n    Let's check the board again.\n    The enemy is at `(6, 8)`.\n    If I move DOWN to `(1, 6)`, I am safe.\n    \n    Let's double check the coordinates.\n    Y increases UP.\n    I am at `(1, 7)`.\n    DOWN is `(1, 6)`.\n    \n    Okay. I'm going DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, look at the board again.\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . . T 0 A . .`\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    `6 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    `5 . A . . . . . . . A`\n    \n    There is an apple at `(1, 5)`.\n    There is an apple at `(2, 3)`.\n    There is an apple at `(3, 4)`.\n    \n    Going DOWN sets me up for this cluster.\n    Going LEFT sets me up for the far left side (which has fewer apples immediately visible, except `(1, 5)` is still reachable but takes longer).\n    \n    Speed is key. I need to close the 0-1 gap.\n    Going DOWN is the fastest path to the nearest apple.\n    \n    Rationale:\n    1.  I need apples to catch up (0-1).\n    2.  The closest apple is at `(1, 5)`.\n    3.  Moving DOWN to `(1, 6)` puts me on the path to `(1, 5)`.\n    4.  It is safe from the enemy who is far away on the right.\n    5.  It keeps options open (Left, Down, Right, Up).\n    \n    Plan: Secure the left-center, eat the apple at `(1, 5)`, then push towards `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)`.\n    \n    Let's check if `UP` is a trap.\n    `UP` to `(1, 8)` puts me near the enemy's row. He is at `(6, 8)`. It's a bit risky to close the vertical distance while he is also on row 8. Better to go down and eat.\n    \n    Let's check `RIGHT`.\n    `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)`. Still central. But I'm not heading towards the closest apple.\n    \n    Decision: DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, looking at the board again.\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . . T 0 A . .`\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    \n    If I go DOWN to `(1, 6)`.\n    Is there any apple at `(1, 6)`? No.\n    Is there any apple at `(1, 5)`? Yes.\n    Is there any apple at `(2, 3)`? Yes.\n    \n    Is there any apple at `(0, 7)`? No.\n    Is there any apple at `(0, 6)`? No.\n    \n    So `DOWN` is strictly better for apple proximity.\n    \n    Safety check for `DOWN`:\n    Cell `(1, 6)` is empty.\n    Enemy cannot reach `(1, 6)` this turn.\n    \n    Okay, going DOWN.\n    \n    Last turn I went LEFT.\n    This turn I go DOWN.\n    This zig-zag pattern keeps me flexible.\n    \n    Plan:\n    Turn 6: Move DOWN to `(1, 6)`.\n    Turn 7: Move DOWN to `(1, 5)` (Eat Apple). Score 1-1.\n    Then assess.\n    \n    Let's write the rationale.\n    \n    \"YO CHAT! We're at `(1, 7)`. The enemy is eyeing us from `(6, 8)` but he's way over on the right. We need to catch up on apples, fast!\n    The apple at `(1, 5)` is staring us down, just two cells below. Moving DOWN to `(1, 6)` puts us on a direct path to chomp it next turn. It's the quickest way to tie up the score.\n    Staying central also keeps our options wide open. We can pivot left or right anytime. If we hug the edge too hard now, we might limit our escape routes later.\n    Let's grab that apple and then set up a blockade!\n    DOWN\"\n    \n    Wait, I should probably stick to the left side if I want to \"box him in\".\n    But `DOWN` is `(1, 6)`, which is still \"left side\" (x=1).\n    The \"far left\" is x=0.\n    x=1 is perfectly fine. It's the second column.\n    \n    Let's look at the `LEFT` option again.\n    `(0, 7)` is empty.\n    From `(0, 7)`, I can go `(0, 6)`, `(0, 5)`, `(1, 7)`.\n    From `(1, 6)`, I can go `(1, 5)`, `(1, 7)`, `(0, 6)`, `(2, 6)`.\n    \n    `DOWN` gives me access to `(1, 5)` (Apple) immediately next turn.\n    `LEFT` gives me access to `(1, 5)` in 2 turns.\n    \n    I'll take the faster route.\n    \n    One final check. Is there an apple at `(1, 6)`?\n    Board:\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . . T 0 A . .`\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    `6 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    `5 . A . . . . . . . A`\n    \n    No apple at `(1, 6)`. The one at `(1, 5)` is the target.\n    \n    Rationale:\n    1.  Target apple `(1, 5)` is closest.\n    2.  Path: `(1, 7)` -> `(1, 6)` -> `(1, 5)`.\n    3.  Enemy is distant (`(6, 8)`), safe to move.\n    4.  Maintains central-left position, keeping options open.\n    \n    Plan: Get the apple at `(1, 5)`, then push down-left to `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)`.\n    \n    Wait, `(2, 3)` is at x=2, y=3.\n    `(3, 4)` is at x=3, y=4.\n    After eating `(1, 5)`, I would be at `(1, 5)`.\n    From `(1, 5)`, `(2, 3)` is `(2, 3) -> (1, 5)`? No, `(2, 3)` is at y=3. `(1, 5)` is at y=5. So I need to go DOWN.\n    `(1, 5)` -> `(1, 4)` -> `(1, 3)` -> `(2, 3)`.\n    That works.\n    \n    Let's go.\n    \n    The prompt says \"Be aggressive\".\n    Moving towards the enemy is aggressive.\n    Moving towards apples is aggressive (because it increases score).\n    Moving DOWN puts me closer to the bottom, where the enemy might eventually go.\n    \n    Final decision: DOWN.\n    \n    One more check on the board state text:\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `8 . . . . . T 0 A . .`\n    `7 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\n    `6 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    `5 . A . . . . . . . A`\n    \n    The apple at `(1, 5)` is in row 5.\n    I am at row 7.\n    Moving DOWN is correct.\n    \n    Rationale:\n    \"YO CHAT! The enemy is lingering in the top right at `(6, 8)`, but I see an opportunity to secure the left side of the board and catch up on apples. The apple at `(1, 5)` is the closest target, and moving DOWN to `(1, 6)` puts me on a direct path to eat it next turn. This closes the score gap (0-1) and keeps my movement flexible. I'm not cornering myself yet\u2014I'm claiming territory efficiently. Let's go!\n    DOWN\"\n    \n    Wait, the prompt says \"Coordinate reminder: decreasing your y coordinate is DOWN\".\n    I am at `(1, 7)`. To go to `(1, 6)`, I decrease y. So the move is DOWN.\n    \n    Perfect.\n    \n    Response structure:\n    1.  Streamer intro/energy.\n    2.  Analysis of board/enemy.\n    3.  Plan.\n    4.  Move (single word).\n    \n    I need to include the long-term plan in the rationale.\n    Plan: Eat `(1, 5)`, then sweep the bottom left ( `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)` ), forcing the enemy into the right wall.\n    \n    Let's write it.\n    \n    YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! TURN 6! \ud83d\udd25\n    We're still at `(1, 7)`. The enemy at `(6, 8)` is eyeing us, but he's stuck over on the right side. We need to close that apple gap (0-1)!\n    \n    There's an apple at `(1, 5)` staring us down. It's the fastest apple to grab. Moving DOWN to `(1, 6)` puts us on a direct collision course with that apple for next turn. This is how we dominate\u2014securing resources fast while keeping the center open.\n    \n    If we stay central-left like this, we can sweep the bottom-left quadrant `(2, 3)` and `(3, 4)` after we eat. We'll box him into the right corner and force him to crash out!\n    \n    DOWN",

He's got 2 apples, I've got 0. We are at `(1, 6)` after that last DOWN move. The target apple at `(1, 5)` is literally right below us! That's the play. We need to close that gap immediately.\n\nLet's break down the moves:\n- **LEFT to `(0, 6)`**: Moves me away from the apple. Bad move, I want points.\n- **RIGHT to `(2, 6)`**: Moves me sideways, away from the apple. Not ideal.\n- **UP to `(1, 7)`**: Moves me back up, away from the apple. Why would I do that?\n- **DOWN to `(1, 5)`**: This is the apple! \ud83c\udf4e If I eat this, I grow, I score, and I catch up to the enemy's score (1-2). This also extends my tail, which helps control space.\n\nIs it safe?\n- The enemy is at `(7, 8)`. He is nowhere near `(1, 5)`. No collision risk there.\n- My body is currently just `(1, 7)`. If I go DOWN to `(1, 5)`, I won't hit my own body. I'm creating a gap of `(1, 6)` which is empty.\n- I am not going out of bounds.\n\nThis is the optimal move. Eating this apple keeps us competitive. We need to show the chat we can secure those points. Once we eat this, we can look at the next targets\u2014there's an apple at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 4)` that are relatively close, or we can sweep the bottom edge.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at `(1, 5)`, then plot a course to the bottom-left cluster `(2, 3)` or `(3, 4)` to keep dominating the left side of the board.

Looking at the board state: The apple at (1,5) is still listed in the Apple Drops, but in the board visual, I see a '1' at (1,5) and an 'A' at (1,4)? No, let's read the board carefully. The board is indexed y from 0 to 9 bottom-up. The row for y=5 says: `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`. That's row 5. (1,5) is the '1'. That's my head. (9,5) is an apple. So the apple at (1,5) is actually... gone? Or did I just eat it? The description says \"Apple drops: (9,5)...\" but doesn't list (1,5) anymore? No, looking at the list: (9,5) is there. But my head is at (1,5) and it's not an 'A' in the board visual. Wait, the board visual shows '1' at (1,5). If the apple was there, it would be '1' covering it. But the list of apple drops is just a history, not the current board. The current board shows apples as 'A'. So is there an apple at (1,5)? The board row 5 says `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`. So (1,5) is my head, and (9,5) is an apple. The apple at (1,5) must have been eaten in the previous move? Or maybe it's still there? Wait, if I moved DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5) and there was an apple, I would have eaten it. The description says \"Apple drops: (9,5), (5,0)...\" and doesn't mention (1,5) in the list for turn 8? Actually, the list provided is \"APPLE DROPS: (9, 5), (5, 0), (8, 2), (3, 4), (6, 0), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3), (7, 6), (8, 0), (7, 7), (9, 4), (9, 3), (3, 8), (5, 2)\". This is a list of positions, not necessarily distinct. It likely includes apples that were on the board previously. But the board state is the current truth. The board state shows no apple at (1,5). So I didn't eat an apple? Or I did and the list is just a history.\n\nLet's look at the scoreboard. My apples: 1. Opponent: 2.\nIn the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section: \"Apples collected: 1\".\nIn the \"LAST RATIONALE\" from previous turn: I said \"Eat the apple at (1,5)\". And I moved DOWN.\nIf I ate an apple, my length would increase. My body was [(1,6)]. If I ate, my body becomes [(1,6), (1,5)]? No, head moves to (1,5), old head becomes body. So body would be [(1,6)]. Wait, if I eat, I grow, so the tail doesn't move. Current body is listed as [(1,6)]. If I ate, my length would be 2 (head + 1 body). Current length is 2. So it's consistent.\nBut the board visual `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A` confirms (1,5) is occupied by '1'. No apple there.\n\nOkay, current state:\nMy Head: (1,5)\nMy Body: [(1,6)]\nOpponent Head: (8,8)\nOpponent Body: [(7,8), (6,8)]\n\nWait, the board shows:\nRow 8: `8 . . . A . . T T 0 .`\nCoordinates (x,y):\n(0,8) is .\n(1,8) is .\n(2,8) is .\n(3,8) is A\n(4,8) is .\n(5,8) is .\n(6,8) is T (Opponent tail?)\n(7,8) is T (Opponent body?)\n(8,8) is 0 (Opponent head)\n(9,8) is .\n\nSo Opponent Head is at (8,8).\nOpponent Body: The list says [(7,8), (6,8)]. The board shows T at (7,8) and (6,8). Correct.\n\nNow, where are the apples?\n(3,8) is an apple. (Row 8, col 3)\n(7,6) is an apple? Row 6: `6 . T . . . . . A . .`. So (7,6) is 'A'. Yes.\n(9,5) is an apple. (Row 5, col 9)\n(4,4) is an apple? Row 4: `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. So (3,4) and (9,4) are apples.\nRow 3: `3 . . A . . . . . . A`. (2,3) and (9,3) apples.\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . A . . A .`. (5,2) and (8,2) apples.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . A . . . A .`. (4,1) and (8,1) apples.\nRow 0: `0 . . . . . A A . A .`. (5,0), (6,0), (8,0) apples.\n\nOkay, let's plan.\nI am at (1,5).\nPossible moves:\n- UP to (1,6): That's my body! I die. (My body is [(1,6)]).\n- DOWN to (1,4): Safe? Board shows `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. (1,4) is '.' (empty).\n- LEFT to (0,5): Safe. `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`. (0,5) is '.'.\n- RIGHT to (2,5): Safe. `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`. (2,5) is '.'.\n\nSo UP is suicide. Eliminated.\n\nNow, evaluate SAFE moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) based on:\n1. Safety (avoid enemy head movement).\n2. Growth/Positioning.\n3. Future options.\n\nEnemy is at (8,8). He has 2 apples, I have 1. He is winning.\nI need to catch up.\nApples near me:\n- (3,8) is far and blocked by enemy territory.\n- (7,6) is far.\n- (9,5) is far.\n- Bottom left: (4,1), (5,0), (6,0) are possible but I need to snake through the board.\n- (2,3) is relatively close: (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3).\n- (5,0) is even further down.\n\nMy body is at (1,6). If I move DOWN to (1,4), my body moves to (1,5) next turn? No, if I move, my tail stays until I grow. My body is just [(1,6)].\nIf I move DOWN to (1,4):\nNew Head: (1,4)\nNew Body: [(1,5)]\nTail: (1,6) disappears? No, length stays 2. Head (1,4) -> Body (1,5). The old body (1,6) becomes the new tail? Wait, standard snake rules. Head moves. Old head becomes neck. The tail moves forward (unless apple eaten).\nCurrent: Head (1,5), Body [(1,6)].\nMove DOWN to (1,4).\nNew Head: (1,4).\nNew Body: [(1,5)].\nThe cell (1,6) is vacated.\nThis is safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,5):\nNew Head: (0,5).\nNew Body: [(1,5)].\nSafe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,5):\nNew Head: (2,5).\nNew Body: [(1,5)].\nSafe.\n\nStrategic considerations:\nI am on the left edge (x=1).\nThe enemy is on the right (x=8).\nThere is an apple at (2,3). That is DOWN and LEFT relative to my current pos? (1,5) -> (2,3) requires x+1, y-2.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,5), I go away from (2,3) and other apples in the middle. I trap myself on the left edge.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I move towards the center. (2,3) is accessible from (2,5) by going DOWN twice. (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I can go (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3). Also accessible.\n\nLet's look at the enemy.\nEnemy at (8,8). He has apples at (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0) on the right wall. He has plenty of food on his side.\nHe is unlikely to come to my side (x=0-2) unless he is forced.\nI need to expand into the board and eat apples to catch up.\nApple at (2,3) seems the closest viable target. Apple at (3,4) is also close.\nApple at (4,1) is further.\n\nLet's analyze the moves specifically:\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (0,5)**\n- Coordinates: (0,5)\n- Safety: Safe.\n- Growth: No apple at (0,5).\n- Future:\n  - From (0,5), I can go DOWN to (0,4), UP to (0,6) (currently blocked by my body at (1,6) if I move? Wait, if I go LEFT, my body is at (1,5). So (0,6) is empty).\n  - However, being at x=0 limits me. I am on the left wall.\n  - Apples: (2,3) is to the RIGHT. I would have to turn around.\n  - This move slows down my access to the central apples.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (2,5)**\n- Coordinates: (2,5)\n- Safety: Safe.\n- Growth: No apple.\n- Future:\n  - From (2,5), I can go DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), RIGHT to (3,5), UP to (2,6).\n  - This puts me in the open.\n  - Path to (2,3): (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3).\n  - Path to (3,4): (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) or (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4).\n  - This looks good. It moves me toward the apple cluster at (2,3), (3,4).\n\n**Option 3: DOWN to (1,4)**\n- Coordinates: (1,4)\n- Safety: Safe.\n- Growth: No apple.\n- Future:\n  - From (1,4), I can go DOWN to (1,3), LEFT to (0,4), RIGHT to (2,4).\n  - Path to (2,3): (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) or (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3).\n  - This also looks good.\n  - However, (1,4) is very close to my body at (1,5) and (1,6). If I go DOWN to (1,4), my body becomes (1,5).\n  - If I then go DOWN to (1,3), body becomes (1,4).\n  - If I go RIGHT to (2,4), body becomes (1,4).\n  - Seems fine.\n\nComparing RIGHT (2,5) vs DOWN (1,4):\n(2,5) is more \"centered\" than (1,4).\n(1,4) keeps me pinned to the left wall slightly (x=1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I effectively open up the board.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I am diving down, which might be necessary to get (2,3).\nBut (2,5) allows me to go DOWN to (2,4) and then to (2,3).\nLet's check distances to (2,3):\nFrom (1,5): Manhattan dist = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nFrom (2,5): Manhattan dist = |2-2| + |3-5| = 0 + 2 = 2.\nFrom (1,4): Manhattan dist = |2-1| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBoth (2,5) and (1,4) are equidistant to (2,3).\nHowever, (2,5) is \"higher\" y-coordinate. (1,4) is lower.\nIf I go to (1,4), I am getting closer to the bottom edge (y=0).\nIf I go to (2,5), I am staying in the middle vertical band.\nThe bottom edge has apples at (5,0), (6,0), (8,0).\nThe left-center has (2,3), (3,4).\nThe right-center has (7,6), etc.\n\nLet's consider the immediate next turn options after each move to ensure I don't get trapped.\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT to (2,5):**\nNew state: Head (2,5), Body [(1,5)].\nMoves next turn:\n- UP (2,6): Is it safe? (2,6) is currently `6 . T . . . . . A . .`. (2,6) is '.'.\n- DOWN (2,4): Is it safe? (2,4) is `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. (2,4) is '.'.\n- LEFT (1,5): Is it safe? (1,5) is my body (next turn it will be, but currently it's my old head? Wait, after I move to (2,5), my body is (1,5). So (1,5) is occupied by my body. Moving LEFT into (1,5) would be hitting my own body. So LEFT is invalid.\n- RIGHT (3,5): Is it safe? (3,5) is `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`. (3,5) is '.'.\nSo from (2,5), I have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n\n**Analysis of DOWN to (1,4):**\nNew state: Head (1,4), Body [(1,5)].\nMoves next turn:\n- UP (1,5): Is it safe? (1,5) is my body. Invalid.\n- DOWN (1,3): Is it safe? (1,3) is `3 . . A . . . . . . A`. (1,3) is '.'.\n- LEFT (0,4): Is it safe? (0,4) is `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. (0,4) is '.'.\n- RIGHT (2,4): Is it safe? (2,4) is '.'.\nSo from (1,4), I also have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n\n**Analysis of LEFT to (0,5):**\nNew state: Head (0,5), Body [(1,5)].\nMoves next turn:\n- UP (0,6): Safe? (0,6) is `6 . T . . . . . A . .`. (0,6) is '.'.\n- DOWN (0,4): Safe? (0,4) is '.'.\n- RIGHT (1,5): Body. Invalid.\nSo only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). This is slightly worse than the others. Being on the wall restricts options.\n\nSo LEFT is the weakest option.\n\nNow compare RIGHT (2,5) vs DOWN (1,4).\n\nGoal: \"Box him in and make him crash out\".\nEnemy is at (8,8). To box him in, I need to control the center or push from the left.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I am moving towards the bottom. The enemy is at the top right.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I am moving towards the center.\nThe apple at (2,3) is a good target.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I can then go DOWN to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,3) to eat the apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I can go RIGHT to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,3).\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (1,4), I am at (1,4). My body is (1,5).\nIf I then go RIGHT to (2,4), my body becomes (1,4).\nIf I then go DOWN to (2,3), my body becomes (2,4).\nThis path works.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), my body is (1,5).\nIf I then go DOWN to (2,4), my body becomes (2,5).\nIf I then go DOWN to (2,3), my body becomes (2,4).\nThis path also works.\n\nHowever, (2,5) is \"higher\" than (1,4).\nIf I am at (2,5), I can also potentially target (3,4) or (4,1) or even loop around.\nIf I am at (1,4), I am committed to the lower path or the left edge.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5: `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`\nRow 4: `4 . . . A . . . . . A`\nRow 3: `3 . . A . . . . . . A`\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . A . . A .`\nRow 1: `1 . . . . A . . . A .`\nRow 0: `0 . . . . . A A . A .`\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5):\nI am at (2,5). (2,5) is empty.\nNext turn, if I go DOWN to (2,4), I am at (2,4). (2,4) is empty.\nNext turn, if I go DOWN to (2,3), I am at (2,3). This is an APPLE!\nSo the sequence: (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) [Eat].\nThis is a clear path to an apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4):\nI am at (1,4).\nNext turn, if I go RIGHT to (2,4), I am at (2,4).\nNext turn, if I go DOWN to (2,3), I am at (2,3) [Eat].\nSequence: (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) [Eat].\nAlso clear.\n\nWhich path is safer regarding the enemy?\nEnemy is at (8,8). He is far away. He can move to (8,7), (8,9) (out of bounds?), (7,8), (9,8).\n(9,8) is out of bounds (max x is 9, so (9,8) is valid? Board is 0-9. Yes (9,8) is valid).\nWait, board is 10x10. x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9.\n(9,8) is valid.\n(8,9) is valid (y=9).\n(9,9) is valid.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,8). He is chasing apples on the right side: (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0).\nHe is unlikely to come left.\nHowever, the board is small. If I grow, I might cut off his access.\nBut for now, he is on the far right.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nMy only threat is myself (crashing into my own body) or the enemy moving into my body.\nMy body is at (1,6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,5), my body moves to (1,5).\nIf enemy moves to (1,5)? No, he is at (8,8). Impossible.\nIf I move DOWN to (1,4), my body moves to (1,5).\nSame safety.\n\nSo safety is equal for RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nWhat about \"Boxing him in\"?\nTo box him in, I need to claim territory.\nCurrently, I am on the left (x=0-1). He is on the right (x=8-9).\nThe center (x=2-7) is mostly empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I claim the center line x=2.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I stay at x=1 but go lower y.\nGoing RIGHT to (2,5) feels more aggressive towards the center. It puts pressure on the board.\nAlso, (2,5) allows me to go UP to (2,6) if needed, which is closer to the center/top.\n(1,4) forces me down.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,4).\nFrom (2,5), (3,4) is distance 2 (Right/Down or Down/Right).\nFrom (1,4), (3,4) is distance 3 (Right/Right/Up or similar).\n(2,5) is better for (3,4).\n\nAlso, looking at the board, there's an apple at (4,1) and (5,0).\nFrom (2,5), I can snake down: (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) [Eat] -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) [Eat] -> (5,1) -> (5,0) [Eat].\nThis is a long-term farm path on the left-center.\nFrom (1,4), the path is similar but starts one step lower.\n\nHowever, there is also an apple at (3,8). Top center.\nFrom (2,5), (3,8) is distance 4.\nFrom (1,4), (3,8) is distance 6.\n(2,5) is better for top apples too.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,8). If he goes for (3,8), we might collide.\nLet's check (3,8). It's an apple.\nEnemy at (8,8). Distance = 5.\nMe at (2,5). Distance = 4.\nI can reach (3,8) in 4 moves.\nEnemy can reach it in 5 moves (if he moves directly Left).\nIf I want to contest (3,8), starting from (2,5) is better than (1,4).\nBut (3,8) is risky because the enemy is heading towards that area.\nThe enemy is at (8,8). He might go to (7,8) -> (6,8) -> (5,8) -> (4,8) -> (3,8).\nWait, his body is at (7,8) and (6,8).\nIf he moves LEFT to (7,8), his body becomes (8,8) and (7,8). The tail (6,8) moves? No, if he doesn't eat, his tail moves forward.\nWait, his body is [(7,8), (6,8)].\nIf he moves LEFT to (7,8), he hits his own body? No, his head is at (8,8). Moving LEFT to (7,8) is occupied by his body.\nSo he cannot move LEFT.\nHe must move UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), or RIGHT (9,8).\nRIGHT (9,8) is open.\nUP (8,9) is open.\nDOWN (8,7) is open.\n(8,7) is `7 . . . . . . . A . .`. Empty.\nSo he will likely move DOWN or RIGHT.\nHe has apples at (9,5) and (8,2), (8,0).\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes towards (8,2) and (8,0).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he goes towards (9,5).\nSo he is NOT coming towards me (Left).\nThis confirms he is occupying the right side.\n\nSince he is committed to the right side, I should aggressively take the left and center.\nThe apple at (2,3) is a great first target to secure the left-center.\n(2,5) puts me on the doorstep of (2,3).\n\nLet's check the move RIGHT to (2,5) against the \"Backwards into own body\" rule.\nMy body is [(1,6)].\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), the cell behind my head (where I came from) is (1,5).\nIs (1,5) part of my new body? No.\nMy new body will be [(1,5)].\nSo moving RIGHT to (2,5) is not moving into my body.\nWait, the rule says \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)?\"\nIf I am at (1,5) facing... wait, I don't have a facing direction.\nThe rule usually applies if I am in a line and try to reverse direction.\ne.g. Head (1,5), Body (1,6). If I move UP to (1,6), that's hitting body.\nIf I move DOWN to (1,4), that's fine.\nIf I move LEFT to (0,5), that's fine.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,5), that's fine.\nThere is no \"backwards\" constraint here because my body is only one segment at (1,6).\nSo all moves are valid as long as I don't hit (1,6).\n\nDecision:\nRIGHT to (2,5) seems the most balanced and aggressive move towards the center/apples.\nDOWN to (1,4) is also good but commits me to the bottom edge slightly more.\nLEFT is weak.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (2,5).\nNext turn, move DOWN to (2,4).\nTurn after, move DOWN to (2,3) to eat the apple.\nThen assess the board. Maybe go for (3,4) or loop back to (4,1)/(5,0).\n\nWait, is there an apple at (2,5)? No.\nIs there an apple at (1,4)? No.\nIs there an apple at (0,5)? No.\n\nLet's double check the board for any apple I missed near (2,5).\nRow 5: `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A` (Apple at 9,5)\nRow 4: `4 . . . A . . . . . A` (Apple at 3,4)\nRow 3: `3 . . A . . . . . . A` (Apple at 2,3)\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . A . . A .` (Apple at 5,2, 8,2)\nRow 1: `1 . . . . A . . . A .` (Apple at 4,1, 8,1)\nRow 0: `0 . . . . . A A . A .` (Apple at 5,0, 6,0, 8,0)\n\nSo (2,3) is the closest apple.\nDistance from (1,5) to (2,3) is 3 steps.\nPath: (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3).\nPath: (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3).\nPath: (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3).\n\nThe path via (2,5) opens up options to go to (3,4) or (4,5) or (5,5) etc.\nThe path via (1,4) limits me to left side or bottom.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nRationale for next turn (to write in the plan section):\n\"Eat the apple at (2,3). Control the left-center. Enemy is trapped on the right.\"\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nFinal check on rules:\n1. Off board? (2,5) is valid (0-9).\n2. Own body? My body is at (1,6). (2,5) is empty.\n3. Enemy body? Enemy is at 8,8 area. Far away.\n4. Backwards? Not applicable.\n\nLooks solid.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 6: `6 . T . . . . . A . .`\nThe 'T' at (1,6) is my tail? No, my tail is (1,6)? Wait.\nMy snake: Head (1,5), Body [(1,6)].\nSo (1,6) is my body (and effectively tail).\nThe board shows 'T' at (1,6)? Row 6: `6 . T . . . . . A . .`\nYes, (1,6) is 'T'. That's my body.\nSo (1,6) is occupied by me.\nMoving UP to (1,6) would kill me.\nMoving RIGHT to (2,5) avoids it.\n\nWhat about (2,5)? Row 5: `5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`\nWait, (2,5) is the 3rd character in row 5.\n`5 . 1 . . . . . . . A`\nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: 1 (My head)\nIndex 2: .\nSo (2,5) is '.'. Correct.\n\nOne more thing.\nThe enemy has 2 apples. I have 1.\nIf I eat (2,3), I will have 2 apples. Tied score.\nThis is good. It keeps me in the game.\nIf I don't eat, I stay at 1. He is at 2. He can extend his lead.\n\nI must eat.\n(2,3) is reachable in 3 turns.\n(3,4) is reachable in 3 turns? (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4). Also 3 turns.\n(3,4) is `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. Yes, apple.\n(2,3) is `3 . . A . . . . . . A`. Yes, apple.\n(3,4) is slightly further in Manhattan distance? (1,5) to (3,4) is |3-1| + |4-5| = 2+1 = 3.\n(1,5) to (2,3) is |2-1| + |3-5| = 1+2 = 3.\nSame distance.\n\nHowever, (3,4) is more \"centered\". (2,3) is closer to the left wall.\nIf I go for (3,4), I might have to deal with the board edge eventually.\nIf I go for (2,3), I can easily pivot to (3,4) or (4,1).\nLet's stick to (2,3) as the first target. It's safer being near the wall initially.\n\nPlan:\nTurn 8: RIGHT to (2,5).\nTurn 9: DOWN to (2,4).\nTurn 10: DOWN to (2,3) -> Eat Apple (Score 2).\nTurn 11: Evaluate. Maybe go LEFT to (1,3) to set up for (4,1)? Or RIGHT to (3,3) to set up for (3,4)? Or DOWN to (2,2) to go to bottom.\n\nWait, if I eat at (2,3), my tail won't move.\nCurrent length: 2 (Head (1,5), Body (1,6)).\nAfter (2,5): Length 2. Head (2,5), Body (1,5).\nAfter (2,4): Length 2. Head (2,4), Body (2,5).\nAfter (2,3): Eat. Length 3. Head (2,3), Body (2,4), Tail (2,5).\nThis is a straight line: (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5).\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (3,3) or (1,3) or (2,2).\n(2,2) is empty. (1,3) is empty. (3,3) is empty.\n(2,2) is directly below.\n(1,3) is left.\n(3,3) is right.\nI'll worry about that when I get there.\n\nFor now, the move is RIGHT.\n\nOne edge case: What if the enemy moves to (1,5)? Impossible.\nWhat if the enemy moves to (2,5)? Impossible.\n\nWhat if there is a hidden apple at (2,5) that the board state missed? The board state is the source of truth. I trust the board state.\n\nWhat if I move DOWN to (1,4)?\n(1,4) is `4 . . . A . . . . . A`. (1,4) is '.'.\nIt is safe.\nIt is closer to the bottom apples (5,0) etc.\nBut it limits my vertical reach on the top side.\n(2,5) allows me to go UP to (2,6) which is near the center.\nThe board has an apple at (7,6) and (7,7).\nTo reach those, I need to cross the center.\n(2,5) is a better springboard for the center than (1,4).\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\nLet's write the response.\nRemember to be hype.\n\"YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT!\"\n\"TURN 8!\"\n\"...\"\n\"RIGHT\"\n\nWait, the user prompt says \"DECREASE your y coordinate is DOWN\".\nMy head is at (1,5).\nIf I go RIGHT, new head is (2,5). y stays 5.\nIf I go DOWN, new head is (1,4). y decreases.\nIf I go LEFT, new head is (0,5).\nIf I go UP, new head is (1,6).\n\nMy plan is RIGHT.\n\nFinal check on \"Box him in\".\nIf I claim the center (x=2-5), I prevent him from crossing left.\nIf I stay at x=1, he can still sneak through the center (x=2-7).\nSo moving to x=2 is better for controlling the board.\n\nLet's do it.\n\nOne minor detail: The enemy has 2 apples. I have 1.\nIf I move RIGHT, I don't eat.\nIf I move DOWN, I don't eat.\nIf I move LEFT, I don't eat.\nSo no immediate score change.\nBut positioning is key.\n\nThe opponent is Snake #0. Head (8,8).\nHe has a body of length 2.\nHe is \"camping\".\nIf he moves DOWN to (8,7), he is safe.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (9,8), safe.\nIf he moves UP to (8,9), safe.\nHe cannot move LEFT (hits body).\nSo he will expand his area on the right.\nI need to expand on the left/center.\n\nThe move RIGHT seems optimal.\n\nI will output:\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! ...\nRATIONALE ...\n... plan to eat (2,3) ...\nRIGHT\n\nOne last check. Is there any apple at (2,5)? No.\nIs there any apple at (1,4)? No.\nIs there any apple at (0,5)? No.\nSo no greedy apple moves available.\nMust position.\n\nWhat if I move UP?\nHead (1,6).\nBody (1,5).\n(1,6) is currently my body/tail.\nIf I move UP, I hit my own body.\nSo UP is death.\nCorrect.\n\nWhat if I move LEFT?\nHead (0,5).\nBody (1,5).\nSafe.\nBut trapped on left edge.\nLess strategic.\n\nWhat if I move DOWN?\nHead (1,4).\nBody (1,5).\nSafe.\nGood access to bottom.\nBut (2,5) is better access to center.\n\nWhat if I move RIGHT?\nHead (2,5).\nBody (1,5).\nSafe.\nBest access to center.\n\nDecision stands.\n\nThe user wants me to \"box him in\".\nIf I go RIGHT, I am taking the center.\nIf I go DOWN, I am taking the bottom-left.\nTaking the center is better for boxing him in the top-right.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nI will write the plan for the next few turns in the rationale.\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT to (2,5) to approach the (2,3) apple and control the center. Next turn go DOWN to (2,4). Then DOWN to (2,3) to eat.\"\n\nWait, I should not explicitly say \"Next turn go DOWN\" in the plan? The prompt says \"plan must appear BEFORE your final move line\". It will be shown back to me next turn.\nSo it's good to have a plan.\n\nOne detail: The apple at (2,3) is at row 3.\nThe apple at (3,4) is at row 4.\n(2,5) is at row 5.\nSo (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) is going down.\n(2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) is going right then down.\nBoth paths exist.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I have the option to pivot to (3,4) if (2,3) becomes dangerous.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I am forced into the bottom corner essentially.\nRIGHT gives more options.\n\nOkay, ready.\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! TURN 8! \ud83d\udd25\nWe just ate... wait, did we eat? The board shows '1' at (1,5). If there was an apple there, we ate it. Score is 1. Opponent is 2.\nWe need to catch up.\nThe enemy is stuck at (8,8) because he can't move left into his own body. He is effectively cornered on the right edge for this turn.\nI need to push into the center.\nFrom (1,5), moving RIGHT to (2,5) opens up the board.\nI can then go for the apple at (2,3) or (3,4).\nMoving DOWN to (1,4) is okay, but (2,5) is better positioning.\nMoving LEFT to (0,5) is bad.\nMoving UP to (1,6) is death.\n\nSo RIGHT is the move.\n\nLet's hype it up.\n\n\"WE ARE MOVING INTO THE CENTER TO APPLY PRESSURE!\"\n\"HE IS TRAPPED ON THE RIGHT, WE NEED TO CLAIM THE LEFT AND CENTER!\"\n\"GOING FOR THE APPLE AT (2,3) NEXT!\"\n\nMake sure the last line is just \"RIGHT\".\n\nDouble check the coordinates.\n(1,5) -> (2,5) is RIGHT. Correct.\n\nOne thought: What if the enemy moves to (7,8)?\nWait, his body is at (7,8) and (6,8).\nIf he moves to (7,8), he hits his own body.\nSo he cannot move to (7,8).\nHe must move OUT from (8,8).\nOptions: (9,8), (8,9), (8,7).\nAll of these are away from me.\nSo he is definitely not a threat this turn.\n\nI am safe to move anywhere (except UP).\nBetween LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT:\nRIGHT is the most aggressive and strategic.\n\nLet's go.\n\nFinal check on the \"APPLE DROPS\" list.\nIt lists (9,5), (5,0), etc.\nIt does NOT list (1,5).\nSo did I eat an apple at (1,5)?\nIf the list is \"drops\", maybe it means apples that have appeared?\nOr apples that were eaten?\nUsually \"Apple drops\" implies they are on the board.\nBut the board visual is the ground truth.\nThe board visual at (1,5) shows '1'.\nIf there was an apple, it's eaten.\nThe list might be outdated or just a history.\nRegardless, my current score is 1. The board shows no apple at my head.\nI must move to find the next apple.\n\nThe closest apple is (2,3).\n(3,4) is also close.\n(5,0) is further.\n(4,1) is close.\n(2,3) is reachable.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,5) is the correct setup.\n\nLet's write the responseYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! TURN 8! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're LIVE and the enemy is STILL camping at `(8, 8)`! He's stuck! He can't move LEFT into his own body at `(7, 8)`, so he's forced to move OUT onto the right edge. He's cornering himself, just like we wanted!\n\nWe're at `(1, 5)`. The apple we ate last turn is gone, and we need to start hunting the next one to catch up to his score (2 vs 1). The board is wide open on our side.\n\nLet's look at the moves:\n- **UP to `(1, 6)`**: That's MY BODY! Instant death. \u274c\n- **LEFT to `(0, 5)`**: This traps me on the left wall. I lose mobility. \u274c\n- **DOWN to `(1, 4)`**: Safe, but keeps me hugging the left side. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to `(2, 5)`**: This is the play! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWhy `RIGHT`?\n1.  **Safety:** `(2, 5)` is empty. The enemy is miles away.\n2.  **Positioning:** This moves me into the CENTER of the board. I control the space. If I stay on the left (`LEFT` or `DOWN`), I let the enemy have the center if he ever breaks out.\n3.  **The Plan:** From `(2, 5)`, I am one step away from `(2, 4)`, and then `(2, 3)`\u2014which has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e I can secure that apple on Turn 10 and tie the score 2-2.\n4.  **Options:** From `(2, 5)`, I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn. I'm not trapped. From `(1, 4)`, I'm stuck going DOWN or LEFT.\n\nWe need to dominate the board and force him to crash into us. Taking the center is step one.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to `(2, 5)` to approach the `(2, 3)` apple and control the center. Next turn, navigate DOWN toward `(2, 3)` to eat and tie the score. Continue sweeping the left/center side to box the enemy into the right corner.\n\nRIGHT",

We are at `(2, 5)` after our last move, and the board is wide open. The enemy at `(9, 8)` is moving onto the right edge. He's boxing himself in while we take control of the map.\n\nLet's analyze the move from `(2, 5)`:\n- **UP to `(2, 6)`**: Safe. Board is open. Moves us closer to the apple at `(3, 4)`? No, actually `(3, 4)` is down-left from here. But `(2, 6)` is just moving up.\n- **DOWN to `(2, 4)`**: Safe. This moves us closer to the apple at `(2, 3)`! \ud83c\udf4e That apple is just two steps away. `(2, 5)` -> `(2, 4)` -> `(2, 3)`. This is the direct hunting path.\n- **LEFT to `(1, 5)`**: Safe. That's where we just came from. We'd be backtracking. Bad for board control.\n- **RIGHT to `(3, 5)`**: Safe. This moves us toward the center-right. `(3, 5)` is closer to `(3, 4)` (apple) and `(5, 2)` (apple). However, `(2, 4)` is closer to `(2, 3)` specifically.\n\nWe need to secure that apple at `(2, 3)` to tie the score 2-2!\nIf we go **DOWN** to `(2, 4)`, we set up a guaranteed eat on the next turn (Turn 10) by going DOWN again to `(2, 3)`.\nIf we go **RIGHT** to `(3, 5)`, we can still reach apples, but we might be fighting for them with the enemy if he breaks out. Since he is currently stuck, we should secure the closest apple first.\n\n**DOWN** to `(2, 4)` is the most direct path to food. It keeps us in the vertical column, preserving options to go LEFT to `(1, 4)` or RIGHT to `(3, 4)` later. It doesn't trap us against the wall like LEFT would.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to `(2, 4)` to position for eating the apple at `(2, 3)` next turn. Once we eat and grow, we will have equal score (2-2) and we can continue sweeping the bottom half of the board while the enemy is stuck on the right edge.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's break down the situation:\n\n**CURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- My head: (2, 4)\n- My body: [(2, 5)]\n- Enemy head: (9, 7), body: [(9, 8), (8, 8)]\n- Score: 1 vs 2 - I'm BEHIND!\n\n**THE APPLE HUNT:**\nThe apple at (2, 3) is RIGHT BELOW ME! If I go DOWN to (2, 3), I eat the apple, grow, and tie the score 2-2! That's the obvious play, but I need to check if it's SAFE considering simultaneous movement.\n\n**ANALYZING EACH MOVE:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (2, 3)**: \n   - This eats the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Is it safe from enemy? Enemy is at (9, 7) - way too far to reach (2, 3) in one turn.\n   - Is it safe from myself? (2, 3) is not in my body (only (2, 5) behind me).\n   - POTENTIAL ISSUE: After eating, my tail stays at (2, 5) temporarily (until next move), so my new body would be [(2, 4), (2, 5)]. This is fine.\n   - **VERDICT: SAFE AND REWARDING!**\n\n2. **UP to (2, 5)**:\n   - This is MY CURRENT TAIL! If I go UP, I'd be moving into my own tail. According to rules, moving backwards into your own body = DEAD. That's a suicide move!\n   - **VERDICT: INSTANT DEATH!** \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 4)**:\n   - Safe from board boundary.\n   - Not hitting my body or enemy.\n   - But I'd be moving AWAY from the delicious apple at (2, 3)!\n   - **VERDICT: SAFE BUT SUBOPTIMAL**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 4)**:\n   - Safe from board boundary.\n   - Not hitting my body or enemy.\n   - Moves me toward center but away from the immediate apple at (2, 3).\n   - **VERDICT: SAFE BUT SUBOPTIMAL**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe enemy is still trapped in the corner at (9, 7). He's likely going to try to break out, but he can't reach my apple in one turn. Going DOWN secures the apple, ties the score, and keeps me in the center for board control. \n\nThe only risk is if the enemy somehow makes a miraculous move to (2, 3), but that's literally impossible - he's 7 columns away and needs to traverse 7+ tiles in one turn. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2, 3) with DOWN move to tie 2-2. After growing, I'll have a 3-segment body: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]. Next turn, I should move RIGHT to (3, 3) to expand my territory and hunt the apple at (3, 4) or (5, 2).

TURN 11! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (2, 3) - just ate that apple! \ud83c\udf4e Now 2-2 tied!\n- My body: [(2, 4), (2, 5)] - growing strong!\n- Enemy head: (9, 6) - moved DOWN from (9, 7)! He's still stuck in that corner!\n- Score: 2-2 - WE'RE TIED! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**THE BOARD IS MINE TO DOMINATE!** The enemy is cornered at the top-right, and I'm centered with easy apple access. Time to make him sweat!\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 4)** - OH NO! That's my CURRENT BODY! If I go UP, I'd be moving directly into my own body segment. That's instant death! \u274c\n   - **VERDICT: SUICIDE! NOPE!**\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 2)** - This is SAFE! Empty space, no threats. But...\n   - The apple at (2, 3) is GONE (I ate it!)\n   - Nearest apples: (3, 4) to the right, (5, 2) down-right\n   - Moving down keeps me centered but I'm not aggressively hunting\n   - **VERDICT: SAFE BUT NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH!**\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 3)** - SAFE! Moves me toward the left side.\n   - Opens up potential to go for (5, 2) or (3, 4) later\n   - But I'm moving away from the dense apple cluster on the right\n   - **VERDICT: SAFE BUT SUBOPTIMAL!**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 3)** - OH YES! THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83d\udd25\n   - SAFE: (3, 3) is empty, not hitting my body\n   - TACTICAL: Moves me CLOSER to TWO apples - (3, 4) above and (5, 2) down-right\n   - AGGRESSIVE: I'm pushing toward the center-right where apples are plentiful\n   - ENEMY PRESSURE: I'm getting closer to his corner while maintaining dominance\n   - After this move, I'll have options to go UP for (3, 4) or RIGHT for more central control\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nThe enemy at (9, 6) is STILL trapped! He can only move UP to (9, 7), DOWN to (9, 5), or LEFT to (8, 6). His tail is at (9, 8), so moving UP is risky. He's forced to be defensive while I'm expanding!\n\nBy going RIGHT to (3, 3), I'm:\n- \u2705 Securing central board control\n- \u2705 Positioning for multiple apple options next turn\n- \u2705 Keeping pressure on the enemy's corner\n- \u2705 Maintaining my body length advantage (3 segments to his 3 segments)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter RIGHT to (3, 3), next turn I'll likely go UP to (3, 4) to eat that apple and grow to 4 segments. This will give me the score lead (3-2) and position me perfectly to continue dominating the center-right. The enemy will be forced to either stay trapped or make a desperate breakout attempt. Either way, I control the board!\n\n**RUTHLESS REMINDER:** If I can keep growing while he's cornered, eventually he'll have no moves and crash. That's how you box someone in! Make every move count toward his eventual demise!\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Here's why:\n- Only one direction that's not into my own body (DOWN and LEFT are suicide)\n- UP keeps me mobile and gives me more options next turn\n- I can go RIGHT next turn toward those sweet apples\n- The enemy is still stuck in the corner - I need to keep expanding while he's trapped\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving UP to (3, 5), I'll be in a better position to chase the apple cluster at (5, 2) or (6, 0). The enemy is cornered at (9, 4) with his body going UP the column. I need to keep growing and box him in eventually! Once I get more apples than him, I can force a head-on collision for the win!\n\nUP",

We\u2019re LIVE\u2014Snake vs the archrival, right on the edge.\n\nFrom current spot: YOUR head is at (9,4); OPPONENT head is at (3,4) with body (3,3),(2,3),(2,4). Apples are buzzing all over, but we\u2019re not chasing them\u2014we\u2019re hunting the space and the counterplay.\n\nSAFE MOVES from (9,4): DOWN to (9,3) (an apple), LEFT to (8,4) (empty), UP would crash into my own neck, RIGHT is off-board. DOWN gives me a growth that speeds up the edge-box strategy while LEFT just shuffles.\n\nI\u2019m choosing DOWN to eat the apple at (9,3). This grows me to six segments and preserves the right-edge corridor, letting me pressure the board while keeping distance from his current footprint.\n\nScore check: I\u2019m up 4 apples to 3. Growing now keeps the lead and sets up a stronger follow-up to box him in later, rather than risking a reckless chase through the middle.\n\nLong-term plan: ride the right border to corral him toward the center later, set up a boxed corridor on the far-right, and only engage in a head-on when I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll win the clash (more apples, safer positioning). Keep tabs on his tail as he snakes leftward, and avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or back-in corners.\n\nTurn-by-turn mindset: prioritize safety first, but maintain aggression by threatening the edge path that forces him toward me. If he veers into my vicinity on the left, I\u2019ll tighten the box and look for a favorable head-on where I\u2019m ahead on apples.\n\nExecuting now.\n\nDOWN",

Next turn, I'll go UP to (2, 8) - looking at the board, (2,8) is empty! That keeps my vertical path open. Then I'll start maneuvering toward the right side to box in that enemy snake. He's currently at the bottom-right corner, but his body is stacked up column 9 going UP. If I can get to the right side and cut off his escape route, he'll be trapped in that corner!

Not an option.\n  - LEFT: to (8,1) would grow by apple, but it breaks the edge containment and invites chase lines behind us.\n  - DOWN: to (9,0) is safe, stays hugging the border, and preserves the boxing corridor.\n\n- Why DOWN over LEFT:\n  - Keeps the right-wall corridor intact, making it harder for him to maneuver around us.\n  - Avoids giving him an easy flanking path or a chase line behind us.\n  - We\u2019re currently ahead on apples; staying compact gives us more control to force future head-ons if opportunity arises.\n\n- Short-term plan:\n  - Stay on the edge with a tight bend-free line: head to (9,0) this turn, tail slides forward, length stays steady.\n  - Watch for his approach; keep space to pivot and pivot toward a potential trap.\n\n- Long-term note (for the next turns):\n  - Maintain the right-edge dominance, using the border to force awkward turns toward his body.\n  - Aim for a controlled head-on if the score gap remains in our favor, or push him into a corner where we can trap him with the border as a shield.\n\nFinal move suggestion for this turn:\nDOWN\n\ndown",

Wait, let me count... 6 body parts means they're at 5 apples? No, let me check...\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nMy head at (1, 7):\n- UP to (1, 8): Empty! (I can see it on the board)\n- DOWN to (1, 6): Empty! (I can see it on the board)\n- LEFT to (0, 7): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (Look at the board, (0,7) is marked as A!)\n- RIGHT to (2, 7): MY BODY! (where I just came from) \ud83d\udc80\n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **UP to (1, 8)** - \ud83d\udd25\n   - SAFE: Empty space\n   - NO apple immediately\n   - Opens up: UP to (1,9), RIGHT to (2,8), DOWN to (1,7)\n   - Moves me toward top-left corner\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 6)** - \ud83d\udd25\n   - SAFE: Empty space\n   - NO apple immediately\n   - Opens up: DOWN to (1,5), RIGHT to (2,6), LEFT to (0,6)\n   - Moves me down toward center\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 7)** - \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n   - IMMEDIATE apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - SAFE: Empty space (apple doesn't count as obstacle!)\n   - Brings me to 6 apples - TIE GAME!\n   - Opens up: UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), RIGHT to (1,7)\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7)** - \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n   - DANGER! MY BODY! Moving back into myself = instant death!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**LEFT to (0, 7)** is THE MOVE! Here's why:\n- IMMEDIATE apple! That's +1 point, bringing me to 6 apples - TIE GAME!\n- I NEED to stay aggressive and catch up NOW\n- Enemy is still trapped in that bottom-right corner at (8,0) - he's got limited mobility down there!\n- After eating, I'll be tied and can position myself to dominate the left side of the board\n- The path is OPEN: From (0,7) I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT - plenty of options\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating at (0,7), I'll be at 6 apples, tied again. Next turn, I should go UP to (0,8) to claim the top-left corner and set up for future apples near the top edge. The enemy is stuck in that corner - if I can get to the right side (column 7,8,9) and cut him off, he'll have nowhere to go! He's currently surrounded by his own body on the RIGHT and the board edge on the BOTTOM. If I can block his LEFT escape route by positioning myself in columns 7-8, he'll be boxed in!

(I can see it on the board - there's an apple at (0,9)!)\n- DOWN to (0, 7): MY BODY! \ud83d\udc80 Would hit myself!\n- LEFT to (-1, 8): OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n- RIGHT to (1, 8): EMPTY! (I can see it on the board)\n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS:**\n\n1. **UP to (0, 9)** - \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n   - SAFE: Empty space, NO body there\n   - HAS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e At (0,9) - I'll GROW and get +1 point!\n   - Opens up: LEFT is OFF BOARD, RIGHT to (1,9)\n   - Moves me to the top-left corner (max Y coordinate!)\n   - After eating, I'll be at 7 apples (still down by 1 from Snake #0)\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 7)** - \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n   - DEAD! Would hit my own body at (0,7)!\n   - NO! Can't go backwards into myself!\n\n3. **LEFT to (-1, 8)** - \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n   - DEAD! OFF BOARD! Can't go left from column 0!\n   - NO! This is suicide!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (1, 8)** - \ud83d\udd25\n   - SAFE: Empty space, NO body there\n   - NO apple immediately\n   - Opens up: UP to (1,9), DOWN to (1,7) (my body though!), RIGHT to (2,8)\n   - Moves me toward the center/top\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**UP to (0, 9)** is the ABSOLUTE PLAY! Why?\n- **APPLE INSIDE!** There's literally an apple at (0,9) - free point and growth! \ud83c\udf4e\n- SAFEST option - empty space, no collision risk\n- Positions me at the top edge where I can control the perimeter\n- After eating, I'll be at 7 apples (only 1 behind Snake #0!)\n- From (0,9), next turn I'll have options: RIGHT to (1,9) or DOWN (but that would be into my body at (0,8))\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI need that apple at (0,9) to catch up! Snake #0 is at (8,2) - he's still in the bottom-right corner. After I eat this apple, I'll be at 7 apples and he'll still be at 8. I need to start closing the gap!\n\nFrom (0,9) after eating, I'll move RIGHT across the top row. I need to get to column 7-8-9 at the top to start boxing him in. If I can get to (9,9) at the top-right corner, I can cut off his escape route and force him into a collision!\n\nHe's collecting apples in the bottom-right, but I'm controlling the top-left. Once I eat this apple, I'll start moving right and start dominating the top half of the board! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LET'S GET THAT BAG AND CATCH UP! UP UP UP!** \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Because UP, DOWN, and LEFT are ALL death sentences! UP and LEFT take me off the board, DOWN hits my own body. The ONLY safe move is RIGHT to (1, 9).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy snake #0 at (7, 2) is still hunting apples in the bottom-right quadrant\n- I'm now positioned at the top-left edge with 7 apples\n- From (1, 9), I'll have options: RIGHT to (2, 9), DOWN to (1, 8), or eventually work my way right across the top row\n- I need to start moving across the top to cut off his access to the right side\n- If I can get to column 7-8-9 at the top, I can start boxing him in from above\n- He's collecting apples in the bottom-right, but once I establish presence on the right side, I can force him into a collision\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT across the top row (1,9) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (5,9) \u2192 etc. While snake #0 is distracted collecting apples at the bottom-right, I'll claim the entire top edge and right side. When he tries to move up or left to escape, he'll either hit my body or be forced into a head-on collision where my superior position wins! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLet's execute!

Let's analyze the current battlefield!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My Head: (1, 9) - I just moved RIGHT from (0, 9)!\n- My Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)] - 7 segments\n- My Score: 7 apples - Still DOWN by 2 from Snake #0 at 9 apples! \ud83d\ude24\n- Enemy Head: (7, 3) - Snake #0 moved UP from (7, 2) - he's climbing!\n- Enemy Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)] - 9 segments\n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS FROM (1, 9):**\n- **UP to (1, 10)**: OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80 - Top edge, can't go higher!\n- **DOWN to (1, 8)**: EMPTY! \u2705 - Safe space!\n- **LEFT to (0, 9)**: MY BODY! \ud83d\udc80 - My tail is there!\n- **RIGHT to (2, 9)**: EMPTY! \u2705 - Safe space!\n\n**THE PLAY IS CLEAR: LEFT to (0, 9) is DEATH!** I just came from there and my body is there now. UP is impossible. So I have TWO safe options: DOWN to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 9).\n\n**WHY I'M GOING LEFT (BUT WAIT... I CAN'T):**\nActually, I CAN'T go LEFT because it's my own body! \ud83d\ude05 Let me reconsider...\n\n**BETTER ANALYSIS - ACTUALLY GOING DOWN:**\nFrom (1, 9), LEFT is death (my body), UP is off board. That leaves DOWN or RIGHT. \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION - DOWN to (1, 8):**\nWhy DOWN instead of RIGHT? Because:\n1. Enemy is at (7, 3) moving UP - he's committing to the right side\n2. The apple at (1, 8) is right there! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. Moving DOWN gives me access to (1, 7), (0, 7), (2, 7) - I can sweep the top-left quadrant\n4. I can then work my way RIGHT across the middle rows to cut off his escape routes\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1. Move DOWN to (1, 8) - grab that apple!\n2. Then DOWN to (1, 7) - but wait, my body is at (1, 7)!\n3. Actually from (1, 8) I could go LEFT to (0, 8) - my tail will move away!\n\n**CORRECT PATH:**\n(1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 (1, 7) is my body... NO WAIT.\n\nLet me be strategic: The apple at (1, 8) is RIGHT THERE. I should take it. From (1, 8), I can go LEFT to (0, 8) which will be empty by then (my tail moves), or RIGHT to (2, 8).\n\n**FINAL CALL:** DOWN to (1, 8) - I grab the apple, expand my territory, and maintain flexibility to sweep left or right next turn. \n\nWAIT - my body is at (1, 7) already! If I go DOWN to (1, 8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (1, 7) but that's my body! I'd be moving backwards!\n\nActually, let me think differently: From (1, 9), RIGHT to (2, 9) might be better because it keeps my options open on the top row and I can then move DOWN through (2, 8), (2, 7) which is currently my body but will move away...\n\n**DECISION:** I'm going RIGHT to (2, 9). From there I have more flexibility and I avoid potential self-collision issues on the left side. Plus I can start working my way down the right side of the top quadrant to cut off the enemy.\n\nActually, I realize I'm overthinking this. Let me be direct: From (1, 9), the ONLY safe moves that don't kill me immediately are DOWN and RIGHT. LEFT is death (my body). UP is off board.\n\nI'll go RIGHT to (2, 9) - it keeps me at the top edge and gives me more board control options.\n\n**WAIT NO - I said LEFT in the move pick! That's a mistake!**\n\nLet me correct this: From (1, 9), I CANNOT go LEFT. The correct move is either DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the board: Apple at (2, 9)? No. Apple at (1, 8)? YES!\n\nI should go DOWN to (1, 8) to grab that apple and maintain position.\n\n**ACTUAL FINAL DECISION: DOWN**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Score gap is in our favor (10 vs 7), so we should press the advantage but stay sharp and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nSAFE OPTIONS SUMMARY:\n- UP to (8,5): safe, not colliding with any body. Keeps space above for future approach to top-right apples.\n- LEFT to (7,4): safe, stays off current body and away from opponent. Brings us toward center-top apple cluster.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): safe, hugging the edge. Keeps open lines but less room to maneuver if opponent plays hard.\n- DOWN to (8,3): DEAD. It\u2019s one of our own body segments, so nope.\n\nDECISION:\n- Move UP to (8,5). It\u2019s the safest path that preserves multiple future options while keeping pressure on the top-right apple grid.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Keep marching upward, then tilt toward the top-right apple cluster (especially around (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)).\n- Maintain open corridors to avoid accidental head-on collisions; don\u2019t block yourself into a corner.\n- If the opportunity arises for a controlled head-on later (with a higher score), take it, but only when safe.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE:\n- Stay aggressive but disciplined: grow safely, push toward the top-right zone, and aim to outpace the rival in apples while avoiding traps. Force the rival into unfavorable lanes and keep your own path clear for quick pivots.\n\nSTART LAST MOVE PICK\nUP\nEND LAST MOVE PICK\n\nUP",

I need to play smart but aggressive.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 8)\n*   **My Body:** (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (8, 5) - *Wait, hold up.* The enemy was at (8, 4) last turn. Now they're at (8, 5)? That's **UP**.\n*   **Enemy Body:** (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)\n*   **Board Visualization:**\n    ```\n     9 T T . A . . .

Grid shows \"A\".\n    *   Safety: No body parts listed at (3, 9).\n    *   Enemy Interaction: Enemy at (8, 5). Safe distance.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe.

Score becomes 9. Enemy is at 10. We tie!\n*   **DOWN** moves us toward the center/open board but no apple immediately.\n*   **RIGHT** moves us toward the right side.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (8, 5) moving UP (presumably towards apples). We are at (3, 8). We are winning on the board position because we have more space to our left and top, while the enemy is cornering themselves on the right edge (x=8/9).\nIf we go **UP** to (3, 9), we get an apple, tie the score 10-10, and secure the top row. From (3, 9), we can drop down or move right later.\nIf we go **DOWN** or **RIGHT**, we miss an apple that is literally right next to us.\nGiven the goal is to box the enemy in, taking space (like the top row) is vital. The apple at (3, 9) is a freebie.\n\n**PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (3, 9) to tie the score. From (3, 9), I'll have a strong position on the top edge. I need to watch the enemy's next move; they might be heading for the apple at (8, 9). I'll prepare to cut them off or secure more apples in the top-left quadrant.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nLet's grab that apple and close the gap!\n\nUP",

The enemy was at (8, 5) according to my last rationale.\n    *   **Check:** The enemy head in the *current* board state is (8, 6).\n    *   That means the enemy moved **UP** from (8, 5) to (8, 6) last turn.\n    *   Did we collide?

WE'RE AT TURN 26! Let's check the board after my UP move last turn.\n\n**LAST TURN RECAP:**\n*   **My Move:** UP to (3, 9).\n*   **Result:** I collected the apple at (3, 9)! My score is now 10 (tied with the enemy!).\n*   **Enemy Move:** The enemy was at (8, 6) (based on the current turn start). Wait, looking at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block, I was at (3, 8) last turn. The enemy was at (8, 5) according to my last rationale.\n    *   **Check:** The enemy head in the *current* board state is (8, 6).\n    *   That means the enemy moved **UP** from (8, 5) to (8, 6) last turn.\n    *   Did we collide? My head was at (3, 8) -> (3, 9). Enemy at (8, 5) -> (8, 6). No collision.\n    *   Did I eat? Yes, apple at (3, 9) is gone. My score is 10.\n    *   Wait, the scoreboard says **Your snake apples: 9**.\n    *   **HOLD UP.** The prompt says \"Your snake apples: 9\" in the header, but I physically moved to (3, 9) which the previous logic confirmed was an apple.\n    *   Let's look at the apple list again: `(5, 0), (6, 0), (4, 1), (7, 6), (7, 7), (5, 2), (8, 9), (6, 7), (5, 1), (3, 1), (7, 8), (7, 9), (4, 7), (9, 3), (1, 0)`.\n    *   The apple list **DOES NOT** contain (3, 9).\n    *   My previous rationale stated: *\"Board Check: Row 9, col 3 is 'A' (from Apple list). Grid shows 'A'.\"*\n    *   **Correction:** The apple list provided in the prompt at the start of *this* turn does **not** list (3, 9). The grid visual shows \"A\" at (3, 9) in the previous turn's visualization, but that apple must have been eaten or it was a visual artifact.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I did **not** eat an apple last turn. I am still at 9 apples. The grid \"A\" was misleading or the apple list is the source of truth.\n    *   *However*, the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block says I went UP. The current board state shows my head at (3, 9). The body connects back.

Next turn, (3,8) moves to (2,8), so (3,8) becomes empty.\n        So I could go DOWN next turn.\n        \n        However, the apples at (7,8), (7,9), (8,9) are closer in terms of \"open space\".\n        \n        Let's stick to RIGHT.\n        \n        **One detail:**\n        The board shows (7,9) and (8,9) as Apples.\n        The enemy is at (8,6).\n        The enemy is 2 squares away from (8,9) vertically? No, (8,6) to (8,9) is 3 squares up.\n        I am at (3,9). To (8,9) is 5 squares right.\n        \n        Enemy is closer to (8,9).\n        But I have the top row advantage?\n        \n        If I go RIGHT, I commit to the top row.\n        \n        What if enemy goes for (8,9)?\n        I might not make it in time.\n        \n        Is there a better move?\n        DOWN to (3,8) is impossible (backwards).\n        \n        What about LEFT to (2,9)?\n        As established, it's a dead end.\n        \n        So only RIGHT is viable.\n        \n        **Wait, is (4,9) safe from enemy collision next turn?**\n        Enemy at (8,6).\n        Enemy moves at same time.\n        If enemy moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n        I move RIGHT to (4,9).\n        Distance is huge.\n        \n        **What about the 'T' at (2,9)?**\n        If I assume the grid is 100% correct and (2,9) is a body part I can't see in the list (maybe a glitch in the list), then moving LEFT kills me.\n        So I MUST move RIGHT.\n        \n        **Decision:**\n        RIGHT.\n        \n        **Plan:**\n        Move RIGHT to (4,9). Secure the top-right quadrant. Prepare to dive for apples (7,8) or (7,9). Watch the enemy's vertical position.\n        \n        **Check (4,9) again.**\n        Grid: `9 T T . 1 . . .

A A .` -> Wait, my head is at (4,9).\n    *   Let's look at the raw string: `9 T T . T 1 . . A A .`\n    *   Indices: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:T, 4:1 (Me), 5:.\n    *   Wait, `(5, 9)` is `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it part of my body? My body is at (3,9), (3,8), etc. (5,9) is empty.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy is at y=6. (5,9) is safe.\n    *   **This is a safe move.**\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nI am at (4, 9).\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (4, 8) opens up the center of the board. I can access the apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7) and (7, 7). The enemy is at (7, 6), so they are close to those apples too.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 9) keeps me on the top row. The top row has apples at (7, 8), (7, 9), and (8, 9).\n\n**Who is closer to the loot?**\n*   **Target (7, 8):**\n    *   Enemy (7, 6) is distance **2**.\n    *   Me (5, 9) is distance **3** (Right->Right->Down).\n    *   Me (4, 9) is distance **4** (Right->Right->Right->Down).\n*   **Target (7, 9):**\n    *   Enemy (7, 6) is distance **3**.\n    *   Me (5, 9) is distance **2**.\n    *   Me (4, 9) is distance **3**.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nIf I go **DOWN** to (4, 8), I enter the \"battleground\". The enemy is very close at (7, 6). If I go center, I risk a head-on collision if he moves up/left.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (5, 9), I flank him on the top side. I get closer to the top-right apples (7,9) and (8,9). Even if he goes for (7,8), I can grab (7,9) or (8,9).\n\nCrucially, moving **RIGHT** keeps me safe from the enemy's immediate path (he is at y=6, I am at y=9). Moving **DOWN** brings me to y=8, which is getting into his vertical range.\n\nAlso, look at the board structure at row 8: `8 T T T T . . . A . .`\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 8), I am in an open space surrounded by my own body on the left and empty space on the right. It's a valid move, but it's aggressive.\n\nHowever, looking at the apple distribution:\nTop Row: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9).\nCenter/Bottom: (6,7), (7,7), (5,2), etc.\n\nIf I take (5,9), I am one step closer to (7,9). The enemy has to navigate through the center to get to the top row. I can secure the top-right corner.\n\nLet's check (5,9) one more time.\nRow 9 string: `9 T T . T 1 . . A A .`\nWait, looking at the provided board string again:\n` 9 T T . T 1 . . A A .`\n` 8 T T T T . . . A . .`\n\nMy head is at (4,9). The '1'.\nThe cell to the right (5,9) is `.`.\nThe cell to the left (3,9) is `T` (My neck).\nThe cell up is out.\nThe cell down (4,8) is `.` (Row 8, index 4).\n\nSo (5,9) is indeed empty.\n\nWhy choose (5,9) over (4,8)?\n1.  **Safety:** Enemy is at y=6. I stay at y=9.\n2.  **Control:** I control the top row.\n3.  **Content:** I get access to (7,9) and (8,9).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,8), I am effectively cutting off the left side of the board, but I am exposing my head to the center. The enemy is already in the center. If he moves UP to (7,7) or (7,8), and I move DOWN/Right, we might meet.\n\nStaying on the top row is safer and directs the flow of the game.\n\n**Move: RIGHT**\n\n**Plan:** Secure the top row. Flank the enemy. Watch for his move towards the top apples. If he moves up, I might need to dive down later, but for now, claim the space.\n\nRIGHT",

Nah, we're gonna squeeze him out.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (5, 9)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 7)\n*   **The Board:** It's a gridlock in the middle, but the top row is wide open.\n*   **The Score:** I'm trailing. I need apples. The top right has (7,9) and (8,9). The enemy is grounded in the center (y=7). If I stay on the roof (y=9), I have free range to the right while he has to navigate the clutter.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **Secure the Roof:** I'm already at (5,9). Moving **RIGHT** puts me at (6,9), setting up a direct path to (7,9) and (8,9).\n2.  **Isolate the Enemy:** He's at y=7. If I stay high (y=9), he cannot threaten me on his next turn. If I drop down into the center now, I risk a head-on collision or getting blocked by his massive body.\n3.  **Don't Trap Myself:** Moving down to (5,8) looks open, but looking at the board string: `8 T T T T . . . A . .` - Wait, looking closer at the visual map provided: `8 T T T T . . . A . .`\n    *   Actually, looking at the map provided in the prompt:\n        ` 9 T T . T T 1 . A A .`\n        Wait, the text map says `9 T T . T T 1 . A A .` but the coordinates show my head at (5,9).\n    *   Let's look at the text map string for row 9: `9 T T . T T 1 . A A .`\n    *   Actually, let's look at the grid representation provided:\n        ` 9 T T . T T 1 . A A .`\n        Index: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:T, 4:T, 5:1, 6:., 7:A, 8:A, 9:.\n    *   Wait, my head is at (5,9). The character at index 5 is `1`. The character at index 6 is `.`.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (6,9) is open.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (5,8): Row 8 string is `8 T T T T . . . A . .`. Index 5 is `.`. That's also open.\n    *   BUT, if I go DOWN to (5,8), I'm exposing myself to the center. The enemy is at (7,7). If he moves UP to (7,8), we are getting very close.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (6,9), I am literally as far away from him as possible while still on the board. He is at (7,7). Distance = |6-7| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   If I went DOWN to (5,8), Distance = |5-7| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3. Same distance.\n    *   However, the enemy has a massive tail trailing down the right side. `Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), ... (9, 1)]`.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (6,9), I am approaching his tail region? No, his tail is low. (9,0), (9,1).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I head towards (7,9) and (8,9).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I head towards (6,8) and (6,7). (6,7) has an apple.\n    *   Which is safer? The top row is empty of bodies except for my own.\n    *   The enemy is at (7,7). If he moves UP, he hits (7,8). If I am at (6,9), I am safe.\n    *   If I am at (5,8), and he moves UP to (7,8) and then RIGHT, or if I move into his path... it's risky.\n    *   The enemy has 12 apples. He is massive. He might try to cut me off. But his head is at (7,7). He is not currently a threat to the top row.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm taking **RIGHT**. I want that top row control. I need the apples at (7,9) and (8,9). The enemy is stuck in the mud. Let's keep him there.\n\nRIGHT",

With our lead (13 vs 9 apples), even a double KO can still favor us if it ends the game cleanly with apples tallied. We\u2019re okay flirting with that risk to grab the apple and keep the pressure.\n- Strategic plan: Take the apple to grow, stay away from tight corners that trap us, and keep future options open to chase more apples or force him into a trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- If we eat UP to (7,9), grow to 14 apples and push the enemy away from easy boxed routes. If he reacts aggressively, the head-on risk becomes an asset given our lead.\n- Keep at least two safe follow-up options after any growth to avoid getting boxed in (preferably continuing toward central/upper zones to threaten more apples and keep him guessing).\n\nChosen move for turn 29:\n- UP\n\nUP",

T T T 1 A A .`\n    Index 5 is currently `1` (Me).\n    Index 4 is `T`.\n    Moving LEFT to `(5, 9)` is actually occupied by my own body `T` (specifically `(5, 9)` is the second segment of my body listed in the data). Wait, let me check my body list again:\n    My Body: `[(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), ...]`\n    If I move LEFT to `(5, 9)`, I am moving directly into my own neck. **CRASH. GAME OVER.** \u274c **ELIMINATED**.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Moving to `(7, 9)`.\n    *   Is it off-board? No, `x=7` is valid.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it Enemy Body? Let's check the enemy `Snake #0`:\n        Head: `(7, 8)`\n        Body: `[(7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1)]`\n        `(7, 9)` is NOT in the list. The enemy is at `(7, 8)`, but he is moving simultaneously. If he moves UP to `(7, 9)` and I move RIGHT to `(7, 9)`, we **COLLIDE HEAD-ON**. If he moves UP, I die. If he moves RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am safe.\n    *   **Risk Level: HIGH.** It's a gamble on his next move.\n4.  **DOWN:** Moving to `(6, 8)`.\n    *   Is it off-board? No.\n    *   Is it my body? Let's check my body list: `(6, 8)` is NOT in the list.\n    *   Is it Enemy Body? Enemy body includes `(8, 6), (7, 7), (7, 6)`... `(6, 8)` is NOT in the list.\n    *   **Risk Level: LOW/MEDIUM.** The enemy is at `(7, 8)`. If I go DOWN to `(6, 8)`, I am not moving into him. However, the square `(6, 8)` is currently empty (based on the board map row 8: `T T T T . . . 0 . .` -> Index 6 is `.`).\n    *   **The Enemy's Move:** If he moves UP to `(7, 9)`, I am safe at `(6, 8)`. If he moves DOWN to `(7, 7)`, I am safe. If he moves RIGHT to `(8, 8)`, I am safe. If he moves LEFT to `(6, 8)`, we collide (he moves into my new spot).\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving DOWN to `(6, 8)` gives me a safe position away from his immediate head. Moving RIGHT to `(7, 9)` puts me directly in the line of fire if he decides to move UP (which he might, as it's an open square).\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at `(7, 8)`. I am at `(6, 9)`.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I go to `(6, 8)`.\nIf he moves **UP**, he goes to `(7, 9)`. We miss each other. (Distance increases).\nIf he moves **RIGHT**, he goes to `(8, 8)`. We miss each other.\nIf he moves **LEFT**, he goes to `(6, 8)` -> **HEAD ON COLLISION**.\nIf he moves **DOWN**, he goes to `(7, 7)`. We miss each other.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I go to `(7, 9)`.\nIf he moves **UP**, he goes to `(7, 9)` -> **HEAD ON COLLISION**.\nIf he moves **RIGHT**, he goes to `(8, 8)`. We miss.\n\nConsidering the board state, `(6, 8)` is an open space with **NO** immediate threats in the adjacent cells (except the enemy's potential position). `(7, 9)` is an open space, but it puts my head directly next to `(7, 8)`.\n\n**CALCULATION:**\nMy Score: 9 (I need apples!)\nEnemy Score: 13 (He is winning).\nIf I die, I lose. If he dies, I win.\nCrashing into him guarantees I lose (since I have fewer apples? No, if we crash, I win because I have 13 vs 9? Wait.\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\nIf we BOTH die, the game ends. The snake with MORE apples wins.\nHe has 13. I have 9.\n**IF WE CRASH, HE WINS (13 > 9).**\nTherefore, **I MUST AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISION AT ALL COSTS.**\n\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to `(7, 9)` risks a collision if he moves UP. If we collide, **I LOSE**.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to `(6, 8)` risks a collision if he moves LEFT. If we collide, **I LOSE**.\n*   However, looking at the board, `(6, 8)` is a slightly more \"central\" position than `(7, 9)`, but `(7, 9)` is literally on the edge of the board.\n*   Actually, let's look at the board map again.\n    Row 8: `8 T T T T . . . 0 . .`\n    Indices: 0:T, 1:T, 2:T, 3:T, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:0 (Enemy Head), 8:., 9:.\n    Wait, the prompt says Enemy Head is `(7, 8)`. The map shows `0` at index 7. Correct.\n    Indices 4, 5, 6 are `.` (Empty).\n    So `(6, 8)` is empty.\n    Row 9: `9 T T . T T T 1 A A .`\n    Indices: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:T, 4:T, 5:T, 6:1 (My Head), 7:A, 8:A, 9:.\n    `(7, 9)` is `A` (Apple). `(8, 9)` is `A` (Apple).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I eat an apple (Score 10). I risk the enemy moving UP (which is his only open path up, as his left is blocked by my body? No, wait. His left is `(6, 8)`. That's empty.\nIf he moves UP, he gets `(7, 9)`. If I move RIGHT, I get `(7, 9)`. Collision. **I DIE.**\n\nIf I go **DOWN**, I do not eat an apple. I go to `(6, 8)`. This is safe from the board edges.\nIf he moves UP, he goes to `(7, 9)` (Apple). No collision.\nIf he moves LEFT, he goes to `(6, 8)` (Collision).\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes to `(7, 7)` (Empty).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he goes to `(8, 8)` (Empty).\n\nWhich move is safer?\nIf I go **DOWN**:\n- I avoid the \"Apple Trap\" at `(7, 9)`. Apples are often kill zones.\n- I move into the center of the board.\n- I am betting he won't move LEFT.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT**:\n- I grab an apple (Content! Score increase!).\n- I move to the top edge.\n- I am betting he won't move UP.\n\n**Is he likely to move UP?**\nHe is at `(7, 8)`. The cell above him `(7, 9)` is an apple.\nHe wants apples. He is winning (13 apples vs 9).\nHe is aggressive.\n**Moving UP is a high-probability move for him because it's an apple.**\nIf he moves UP to get the apple, and I move RIGHT to get the same apple, we crash.\n**Crash = I lose (13 > 9).**\n\n**Is he likely to move LEFT?**\nLeft is `(6, 8)`. This is empty.\nWhy would he move left?\nTo cut me off? Maybe.\nBut apples are more tempting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGoing **RIGHT** is a suicide play if he follows his hunger for the apple.\nGoing **DOWN** is the defensive play. It avoids the apple collision zone. Even if he moves LEFT, it's a 50/50 gamble, but moving RIGHT is a 50/50 gamble against a guy who *wants* apples.\n\nWait, let's look at the map again.\nRow 9: `9 T T . T T T 1 A A .`\nMy head is at 6.\nApple is at 7.\nIf I move right, I take the apple at 7.\nIf he moves up, he takes the apple at 7.\nCollision.\n\nIf I move down, I go to `(6, 8)`.\nRow 8: `8 T T T T . . . 0 . .`\n`(6, 8)` is safe.\n\nHowever, I am in a bad spot. I am trapped on the top row by my own body. My body is `(5,9), (4,9)...`\nIf I move **DOWN**, I open up the path to return to the top later. If I move **RIGHT**, I commit to the top wall.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's body again.\n`Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1)]`\nHis body is mostly on the right side (x=7, 8, 9) and bottom.\nIf I stay on the left/top, I am safe from his body.\n\n**The Real Play:**\nI am losing 9 to 13.\nI need to grow.\nBut I cannot die.\nIf I die, I lose immediately.\nIf I live, I have 120 turns to catch up.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to `(6, 8)` feels like the only move that doesn't rely on the enemy ignoring an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am forcing a collision if he goes for the apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I am safe.\n\nWait, is `(6, 8)` actually safe?\nMy body is at `(5, 9), (4, 9)...`\nThe enemy head is at `(7, 8)`.\nThe enemy body is at `(7, 7)`.\nSo `(6, 8)` is empty.\n\n**Why not LEFT?**\nLeft is `(5, 9)`.\nMy body list: `[(5, 9), ...]`\nYes, `(5, 9)` is my neck. Moving left kills me. So LEFT is out.\n**Why not UP?**\nOff board. Out.\n\n**The Choice: DOWN vs RIGHT.**\n\nIf I go **DOWN**: I am at `(6, 8)`.\nIf he goes **UP**: He is at `(7, 9)`. We are safe.\nIf he goes **LEFT**: He is at `(6, 8)`. We collide. (He dies if he moves into me? No, \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH die.\")\nWait. If he moves LEFT to `(6, 8)` and I am at `(6, 8)`, we both die.\nIf we both die, score comparison. 13 vs 9. **I lose.**\nSo I need to avoid him moving LEFT.\n\nWhy would he move LEFT?\nHe is at `(7, 8)`.\nHis Left: `(6, 8)` (Empty).\nHis Up: `(7, 9)` (Apple).\nHis Down: `(7, 7)` (Body).\nHis Right: `(8, 8)` (Empty).\n\nHe is trapped in a way too. He cannot go down (his body). He probably wants the apple at `(7, 9)`. Or he wants to chase me.\nIf I move DOWN, I am at `(6, 8)`.\nIf he moves UP, he is at `(7, 9)`.\nIf he moves RIGHT, he is at `(8, 8)`.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I am at `(7, 9)`.\nIf he moves UP, he is at `(7, 9)`. Collision.\nIf he moves RIGHT, he is at `(8, 8)`.\n\nThe apple at `(7, 9)` is a trap.\nThe enemy is winning. He has 13 apples. He doesn't *need* that apple as much as I do, but he will likely take it because it's there.\nIf I don't take it, and he takes it, he gets closer to 30.\nBut if I try to take it and he takes it, I die.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI am at `(6, 9)`.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I go to `(6, 8)`.\nFrom there, I can move to `(5, 8)` or `(6, 7)` (Apple at 6,7!).\n`(6, 7)` is an apple.\nIf I go down to `(6, 8)`, next turn I can go to `(6, 7)` and eat an apple without risking a head-on collision with the enemy (who will likely be elsewhere).\nThis is a **BETTER** apple path.\n`(6, 7)` is an apple.\n`(5, 1)` is an apple.\n`(4, 1)` is an apple.\nThe top right is full of apples `(7,9), (8,9)`, but it's also full of risk.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(7, 9)`:\nI get +1 score. (10 total).\nI am at the top right corner.\nNext moves: `(8, 9)` (Apple) or `(7, 8)` (Enemy occupied currently).\nIf I am at `(7, 9)`, I am trapped in the corner unless I go DOWN to `(7, 8)`.\nBut `(7, 8)` is where the enemy is *right now*.\nIf the enemy moves, `(7, 8)` becomes empty.\nBut if I go to `(7, 9)`, I am cornered.\n\n**The Trap:**\nI am at `(6, 9)`.\nEnemy at `(7, 8)`.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(6, 8)`, I am safe.\nThe enemy is likely to go **UP** to `(7, 9)` because it's an apple.\nIf he goes UP, I am safe at `(6, 8)`.\nIf he goes LEFT, we crash.\nBut why would he go LEFT?\nHe sees me at `(6, 9)`.\nIf he goes UP, he gets an apple and gets away from me.\nIf he goes LEFT, he risks a collision.\n\n**I am taking the DOWN move.**\nIt avoids the immediate apple trap at `(7, 9)`.\nIt opens up the path to the apple at `(6, 7)`.\nIt moves me towards the center where I have more options.\n\nWait, looking at the board map again.\nRow 8: `8 T T T T . . . 0 . .`\nIndices 4, 5, 6 are empty.\nI am at `(6, 9)`. Down is `(6, 8)`.\nIs `(6, 8)` blocked?\nMap says index 6 of row 8 is `.`.\nSo it is empty.\n\nWhat about my body? My body is at `(5, 9), (4, 9)...`\nMy body is mostly on the top row (y=9) and left side.\n`(6, 8)` is clear.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **DOWN**.\nThis is the safest move to avoid the collision on the top row.\n\nWait, I need to check the \"Last Move Rationale\" requirement.\nIt says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nI will write a plan.\nAnd the final word must be the direction.\n\nMy plan:\nSurvive the turn. The enemy is at `(7, 8)`. I am at `(6, 9)`.\nMoving **DOWN** to `(6, 8)` is the only move that guarantees I don't crash into my own body (Left) or the wall (Up).\nIt also avoids the high-probability collision at `(7, 9)` if the enemy goes for the apple.\nFrom `(6, 8)`, I can target the apple at `(6, 7)` next turn.\n\nDouble check collision logic.\nIf I go DOWN to `(6, 8)`.\nEnemy moves UP to `(7, 9)`. Safe.\nEnemy moves LEFT to `(6, 8)`. Collision. Both die. I lose (13 > 9).\nIs `(6, 8)` dangerous?\nEnemy is at `(7, 8)`.\n`(6, 8)` is adjacent left.\nIf he moves left, he hits me.\nDoes he want to hit me?\nHe is winning (13 > 9).\nHe wants to survive.\nIf he moves left, he risks death. If he moves UP, he gets an apple.\nA smart enemy will take the apple.\nIf he is dumb and moves left, I die.\nBut if I go RIGHT, I risk him taking the apple and hitting me.\nProbability of him taking the apple is higher than him moving left into an unknown spot.\nSo RIGHT is riskier.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the play.\n\nWait, is there a block?\nMy body is at `(5, 9), (4, 9)...`\nEnemy body is at `(7, 7)...`\n`(6, 8)` is empty.\n\nOne final check.\nCan I go LEFT? No, `(5, 9)` is my body.\nCan I go UP? No, off board.\nCan I go RIGHT? Yes, but high collision risk with apple.\nCan I go DOWN? Yes, safest.\n\nI will move DOWN.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to `(6, 8)` to avoid the enemy and the wall. Prepare to move to `(6, 7)` (Apple) next turn.\n\nFinal Move: DOWNYO CHAT! We're in the ENDGAME now! \ud83d\udea8 The enemy is at `(7, 8)` breathing down my neck, but if I try to snatch that apple at `(7, 9)` I'm risking a **HEAD-ON COLLISION**!\n\nIf we crash, his score (13) beats mine (9) and I lose the stream! I can't let that happen! \ud83d\ude24\n\nSo here's the plan:\n1.  **RETREAT & REPOSITION:** I'm moving **DOWN** to `(6, 8)`. This gets me off the dangerous top wall and away from his immediate reach.\n2.  **SETUP THE PLAY:** From `(6, 8)`, I can pivot to `(6, 7)` next turn to grab that apple safely while he's distracted.\n3.  **PLAY IT SAFE:** I'm down on the scoreboard, but staying alive is the only way to catch up. I won't let him trap me in the corner!\n\nLet's make the safe play and live to fight another turn! We stayin' alive! \ud83d\udc80\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f",
