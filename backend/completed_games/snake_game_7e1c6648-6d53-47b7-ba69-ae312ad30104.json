All stay inside board, no self\u2011collision, and none land on opponent's current head. The only apple we can reach soon is at (9,3) two steps east, so moving RIGHT puts us directly on the path to that tasty snack. If we go LEFT or DOWN we wander away from any apple and risk getting boxed in by the opponent's potential left\u2011ward crawl. UP also stays empty but doesn't bring us closer to any fruit. So the smartest play is to edge east, set up a future bite, and keep the board open for more apples.  \n\nPlan: Move RIGHT now \u2192 (8,3). Next turn aim for (9,3) to eat an apple, then evaluate new options. Keep an eye on opponent's possible left or vertical moves to avoid head\u2011on collisions.  \n\nRIGHT",

NO IMMEDIATE THREATS ON THESE SQUARES THIS TURN.  \n- APPLES ON BOARD: I see an apple sitting at (8,5) right next to my head. EATING THAT NOW gives me +1 apple and a clean early grow.  \n- RISK CHECK: None of the SAFE moves put me into the opponent\u2019s path this turn, and there\u2019s no head-on collision risk this turn. Heading toward (8,5) keeps me on the right edge with room to maneuver and sets me up for back-to-back apple grabs if the wall helps trap the space.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- Primary plan: grab the nearby apple at (8,5) now, then pivot toward the next closest safe apple (likely (7,5) or (9,8) depending on how the board flows) while maintaining open escape routes.  \n- Secondary goal: avoid tight dead-ends near the wall; keep at least two safe follow-ups after each move.  \n- Mindset: pressure the rival by staying on the edge where they can\u2019t easily box me in, while I stack apples and grow length to secure control.\n\nMOVE CHOICE FOR THIS TURN: LEFT\nLEFT",

Plus, it forces the opponent to think twice before colliding with us at (9,3) \u2013 they\u2019d have to teleport there, which is highly unlikely.  \n\nSo, the smartest play is to edge east, claim that sweet apple, and keep the board wide open for future maneuvers.  \n\nRIGHT",

Neck is at (8,9) (the next segment in our body).\n- Consider all four directions:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,10): off the board. DEAD end.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (10,9): off the board. DEAD end.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,9): that\u2019s directly into our own neck. DEAD end.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,8): safe so far (on board, not in own body).\n- Only SAFE move: DOWN. No immediate self-collision, no instant off-board, and it doesn\u2019t collide with opponent body this turn (opponent head at (8,6)).\n\nMOVE CHOICE\n- DOWN to (9,8).

If not, we still keep a solid position with an open route toward top-right apples and future turns.\n\nSTRATEGY ALERT\n- We\u2019re not boxed in yet; we\u2019re keeping doors open. If the rival tries to chase, they\u2019re not in a position to trap us on this turn.\n- After this turn, plan to:\n  - Explore the top-right region while avoiding cramping our own necks.\n  - Use the edge to keep maneuver space and threaten future apple pickups while preventing a clean sandwich by the rival.\n  - Continue to pressure the rival with safe routes rather than risky head-ons.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN NOTE\n- Focus on UP/RIGHT-leaning routes from (9,8) next turns if safe, but always avoid self-collision or entering their body.\n- If we can harvest the apple at (9,8) this turn, we\u2019ll be at 5 apples and in a better position to outbox the opponent later.\n\nTURN 8 ACTION: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT is a no-go (that\u2019s into your own neck at (9,7)).\n- LEFT is risky this turn because Snake #1 could counter with RIGHT to (7,7), leading to a potential head-on collision. Not worth it when you\u2019re already plus-apple ahead.\n- UP (8,8) bumps into your own tail this turn (the tail is at (8,8) and would vacate if you don\u2019t eat an apple), so it\u2019s safe but grants less immediate progress toward new apples.\n- DOWN (8,6) keeps you on a safe, open line on the right edge and lines you up to reach apples near the bottom on x=8 (e.g., (8,1) and (8,0)) in a few moves. It also avoids any head-on risk this turn.\n\nShort-term plan\n- Stay on the right edge, dodge the head-on trap with Snake #1, and push toward the lower-right apple cluster.\n- Keep multiple follow-up options open (down again, or left if Snake #1 isn\u2019t contesting that square).\n- Maintain space to avoid getting boxed in; we\u2019re up 5 apples to 2, so don\u2019t risk a grind-out in a corner.\n\nPlan for next turns (to future self)\n- If safe, keep sliding down along x=8 toward (8,1)/(8,0) to pick up more apples and extend lead.\n- Watch Snake #1; if he commits to a chase on the right edge, avoid quick ditches that trap you against the board or against his neck.\n- If a favorable head-on opportunity arises, force them into a boundary trap only if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll survive and win the ensuing apples tally.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT runs into my own neck at (4,3).\n\n- REASONING: UP grabs the apple at (3,4) now (+1 apple, growth) and keeps multiple escape options open. LEFT is solid too but delays immediate gain. Since we want content and space to maneuver, UP edges out as the best proactive play.\n\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN: Eat (3,4) this turn, grow, and keep two viable paths to dodge and chase nearby apples while pressuring the rival\u2019s position.\n\n- OPPONENT VIEW: They can\u2019t move Up (blocked by their own body at (3,2)); they\u2019ll choose among Down (3,0), Left (2,1), or Right (4,1). We\u2019ll be in a stronger board state after we eat.\n\n- EMOJIS AND VIBE: Let\u2019s push the advantage, lock in space, and hunt those apples. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Keeps multiple safe follow-ups and keeps pressure on the center area.\n  - RIGHT to (4,4): safe, no apple, preserves space for micro-angles.\n  - LEFT to (2,4): safe, shields a bit and keeps options open.\n  - DOWN to (3,3): dead-on-your-neck; avoid.\n\n- MOVE OF CHOICE: UP to (3,5). It eats the apple, grows, and continues to create space around the head while threatening new paths toward the top-middle apples.\n\n- WHY UP OVER RIGHT: Eating now compounds future options (more length but still flexible) and helps drain a nearby apple while the rival sits lower on the board, reducing risk of a quick box-in.\n\n- OPPONENT CONTEXT: Snake #1 is at (4,1). They can\u2019t contest the apple at (3,5) this turn and their next steps won\u2019t instant-collide with our new head position.\n\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN: Eat (3,5) this turn; on turn 28, pivot toward the upper/apples cluster to pressure them while maintaining at least two safe exits. If they misstep closer to your flank, trap with smart turns around the top rows.\n\n- LONG-TERM NOTE: Keep alternating between edge-friendly routes and interior dodges; bait their movements toward the border while grazing the abundant apples (top-right and near (3,6)/(3,7) for instance).
