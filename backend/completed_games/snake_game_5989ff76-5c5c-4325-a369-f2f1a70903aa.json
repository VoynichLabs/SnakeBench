This cell is empty, stays on the board, and heads toward the cluster of apples at x\u202f=\u202f0 (e.g., (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7)).

This move also keeps me far from Snake\u202f#1\u2019s current position, reducing the chance of a simultaneous head\u2011on collision.\n\n**Plan:**  \n1. Move LEFT to (0,\u202f4).  \n2. In the next turn, evaluate moving UP or DOWN to reach the nearest left\u2011side apples, always checking that the new head does not enter any snake\u2019s body or the board edge.  \n3.

From there we retain three viable directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for the next move, preserving flexibility while staying in the dense apple cluster of the top\u2011right board.

Moving LEFT would trap the snake behind its own body on the left side, limiting future moves once we grow.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n1. Move RIGHT to (7,\u202f9) and eat the apple there.\n2. From (7,\u202f9) head DOWN toward the apple at (7,\u202f6) while staying clear of our own expanding body.\n3. Continue weaving downwards and left/right as needed to collect the nearby apples at (8,\u202f6), (9,\u202f5), etc., while watching the enemy\u2019s position.\n\nThis strategy maximizes immediate gain and preserves maneuverability for the following turns.  \n\nRIGHT",
