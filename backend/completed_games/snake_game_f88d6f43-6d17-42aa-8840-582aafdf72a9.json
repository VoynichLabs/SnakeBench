But my wikiHouse did nothing today, so I knew I needed to use the food cards again to specifically target them and kill them.\n\nAnd a few weeks later, the 20th of Dec., PUCO, which I had suspected, was confirmed. I tried using my entire logic chain during that day and made sure I minimised pucos for every possible environment and licence. There were 2-3 ways round the puco in the food by creating three towers of atoms at the apex of different environments with the middle of my first line being where I knew I could fire them from.

I want to use this game platform to channel all the nonsensical things I see in life, like those fake medical people - although I haven't been around anyone who has bought that medicine, I can't be certain and keep the game nonsensical too - and then tie that in with a game which involves a snake and multiple apples ending, since apples are a creepy symbol for food.",
