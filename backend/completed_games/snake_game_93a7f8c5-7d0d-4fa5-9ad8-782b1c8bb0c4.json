A . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- Snake #0 (enemy) is at (1, 8)\n- Apples are marked with 'A' at (5,7), (1,1), (4,7), (4,4), (7,5)\n- Snake #1 (you) is at (1,3)\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Move from (1,3) to (0,3) (off the board, y=0 is bottom row, so this is invalid)\n   - **Eliminated**: Off the board.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move from (1,3) to (2,3)\n   - Check if this cell is occupied by enemy or your own body: no.\n   - Check if this cell is occupied by an apple: no.\n   - Check if this cell is occupied by enemy head: enemy head is at (1,8), so no.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move from (1,3) to (0,3) (off the board, x=0 is leftmost column)\n   - **Eliminated**: Off the board.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Move from (1,3) to (2,3)\n   - Wait, this is the same as DOWN. Actually, moving right from (1,3) would be (2,3), same as DOWN. Wait, no, moving right from (1,3) is (1+1, 3) = (2,3). So same as DOWN.\n\nWait, let me clarify directions:\n- **UP**: y increases (upwards)\n- **DOWN**: y decreases (downwards)\n- **LEFT**: x decreases (leftwards)\n- **RIGHT**: x increases (rightwards)\n\nSo:\n- **UP**: (1,3) -> (1,4)\n- **DOWN**: (1,3) -> (2,3)\n- **LEFT**: (1,3) -> (0,3) (off the board)\n- **RIGHT**: (1,3) -> (2,3)\n\nSo, **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are the same move in this case.\n\n### Safe Moves:\n- **DOWN** or **RIGHT** to (2,3)\n\n### Check if this cell is safe:\n- (2,3) is not occupied by enemy head (enemy is at (1,8))\n- (2,3) is not occupied by any apple\n- (2,3) is not occupied by your own body (you have no body yet)\n\n### Next Step:\nNow, let's consider what happens if we move to (2,3):\n- If we move to (2,3), our snake will be at (2,3) with no body.\n- Next turn, we can grow by adding a body segment.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\n- **Immediate Goal**: Move to a safe cell to avoid immediate death.\n- **Next Turn**: Grow by adding a body segment to (1,3) or (2,3) depending on where we want to go next.\n- **Apple Strategy**: Look for apples that are reachable without immediate danger and avoid enemy paths.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\nEnemy is at (1,8). Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP: (1,9) - off the board\n- DOWN: (2,8)\n- LEFT: (0,8) - off the board\n- RIGHT: (1,7)\n\nEnemy will likely move to (2,8) or (1,7) to avoid immediate death.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- Closest apples to our current position (1,3):\n  - (1,1) is far away (left and down)\n  - (4,4) is far away\n  - (5,7) is far away\n  - (4,7) is far away\n  - (7,5) is far away\n\nNone of the apples are immediately adjacent to our current position. So, we need to plan a path to reach apples.\n\n### Snake Growth:\nSince we have no body, we can only move one segment at a time. We need to grow to have a body to plan longer paths.\n\n### Safe Move:\n**DOWN** or **RIGHT** to (2,3) is the only safe move.\n\n### Next Turn:\nAfter moving to (2,3), we can grow by adding a body segment to (1,3) or (2,3) depending on our next move.\n\n### Final Decision:\nSince we have no body, we should move to a cell that allows us to grow and explore the board safely. Moving to (2,3) is safe and allows us to grow next turn.\n\n**RIGHT** is the same as DOWN in this case, so let's choose RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nRIGHT",

A . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- Your snake is at (2, 4).\n- Enemy is at (3, 8).\n\n---\n\n### **Immediate Threats and Constraints**\n1. **No Body Yet**: Since your snake has no body, you can move freely without immediate collision risks (except for the enemy).\n2. **Enemy Movement**: The enemy is at (3, 8) and will move this turn. Their possible moves:\n   - UP: (3, 7) (safe, no collision with your snake)\n   - DOWN: (4, 8) (safe, no collision)\n   - LEFT: (2, 8) (collision with your snake if you move to (2, 8) or (1, 8))\n   - RIGHT: (4, 8) (same as DOWN)\n   - **Critical**: If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), it will collide with your snake if you move to (2, 8) or (1, 8). So, avoid moving into y=8 unless you can block it.\n\n3. **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple to your snake is (4, 4) and (4, 7). However, (4, 4) is not directly reachable from (2, 4) in one move (you'd need to move diagonally, which is not allowed). The next closest is (4, 7), which is one move RIGHT (x=3) or DOWN (y=5).\n\n---\n\n### **Possible Moves and Their Implications**\n1. **UP (y=3)**:\n   - New position: (2, 3)\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Avoids y=8 (safe from enemy LEFT move).\n     - No immediate collision risk.\n     - Future growth options remain open (e.g., expand left or right).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - No apple here, but this is a safe pivot point for future expansion.\n\n2. **DOWN (y=5)**:\n   - New position: (2, 5)\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Closer to (4, 4) apple (but still not directly reachable in one move).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), this move doesn't block it, but it's still safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (x=1)**:\n   - New position: (1, 4)\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Closer to (1, 1) apple (but still not reachable in one move).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), this move doesn't block it, but it's still safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x=3)**:\n   - New position: (3, 4)\n   - **Pros**:\n     - Closer to (4, 4) apple (but still not reachable in one move).\n   - **Cons**:\n     - If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), this move doesn't block it, but it's still safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n**Turn 2 (Current Turn):**\n- Prioritize safety and future growth. Move to (2, 3) to avoid y=8 and set up for expansion.\n- **Key Goal**: Avoid being trapped in a corner or blocked by the enemy.\n\n**Turn 3:**\n- From (2, 3), expand left or right to block enemy's potential moves. For example, move to (1, 3) or (3, 3) to cover ground.\n\n**Turn 4:**\n- Extend toward (4, 4) apple or block enemy's path. If enemy moves to (2, 8), block (2, 7) next turn.\n\n**Turn 5:**\n- Target (4, 4) apple if reachable. If blocked, pivot toward (5, 4) or (3, 5).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe safest move that keeps options open and avoids immediate threats is **UP**. This move avoids y=8 and sets up for future expansion.\n\n**UP**",

Block this by moving to (2, 7) or (1, 7) next turn.\n  - RIGHT: (4, 8) → same as DOWN.\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1. **Safety:** Avoid enemy’s LEFT move (3, 8 → 2, 8). Your snake is at (2, 3), so no immediate collision risk yet, but future moves must account for this.\n2. **Apple Proximity:** Closest apples are (4, 4) and (4, 7). From (2, 3), reachable apples in 2 moves:\n   - (4, 4): Path (2,3) → (3,3) → (4,3) → (4,4) (but no apple at (4,3)).\n   - (4, 7): Path (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (4,6) → (4,7) (too long).\n   - Better: (4, 7) is reachable via (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (4,6) → (4,7) (still too long). **No direct 1-turn apple access**, so prioritize safety and expansion.\n\n**Enemy Threat Mitigation:**\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), block it by moving to (2, 7) or (1, 7) next turn. To do this, your snake must grow to cover (2, 7) or (1, 7). This requires expanding **right or left** from (2, 3).\n\n**Move Prioritization:**\n1. **UP (y=2):** (2, 2). Pros: Keeps snake near center-left (safe from enemy’s LEFT move). Cons: No apple, but future expansion left/right is open.\n2. **DOWN (y=4):** (2, 4). Pros: Closer to (4, 4) apple (but still unreachable in 1 move). Cons: If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), this move doesn’t block it.\n3. **LEFT (x=1):** (1, 3). Pros: Blocks enemy’s LEFT move if enemy tries (2, 8). Cons: If enemy doesn’t move LEFT, this move is less strategic.\n4. **RIGHT (x=3):** (3, 3). Pros: Expands right, blocks enemy’s LEFT move if enemy tries (2, 8). Cons: If enemy doesn’t move LEFT, this move is less strategic.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **RIGHT (x=3):** (3, 3). This expands your snake to the right, covering (3, 3) and creating a barrier against enemy’s LEFT move. If enemy tries (2, 8), your snake at (3, 3) won’t collide, and you can block (2, 7) next turn by moving to (2, 3) → (2, 4) → (2, 5) → (2, 6) → (2, 7).\n\n---\n**Final Decision:**\nRIGHT\n\n---\n**End of Long-Term Strategy Note.**",

Their next move must avoid collision with your snake (now at (3, 4)).\n- **Apples:** (1,1), (4,4), (7,5), (0,2), (5,3). Closest to you is (4,4) and (5,3).\n\n### **Immediate Threats & Safety:**\n1. **Enemy Movement:** Snake #0’s head is at (5,7). Their body is at (4,7) and (3,7). If they move LEFT to (3,7), they will collide with your snake if you don’t block it. If they move DOWN to (6,7), no immediate collision risk.\n2. **Your Snake’s Body:** Currently only the head at (3,4). No tail yet, so no self-collision risk.\n3. **Board Boundaries:** No immediate risk of going off the board.\n\n### **Safe Moves:**\n- **UP (y=3):** (3,3). No apple, but keeps snake near center.\n- **DOWN (y=5):** (3,5). Blocks enemy’s LEFT move to (3,7) by occupying (3,5). Also, (5,3) is an apple.\n- **LEFT (x=2):** (2,4). No apple, but expands left.\n- **RIGHT (x=4):** (4,4). **Apple at (4,4)!** This is the best immediate reward.\n\n### **Move Analysis:**\n- **UP:** Safe but no apple. Keeps snake in a neutral position.\n- **DOWN:** Blocks enemy’s LEFT move to (3,7) and reaches (5,3) in 2 moves (not optimal yet).\n- **LEFT:** No apple, but expands left. Enemy’s LEFT move (3,7) isn’t blocked.\n- **RIGHT:** **Eats apple at (4,4)**.

If they move DOWN to (6,7), no issue.\n\n### **Best Move:**\n**RIGHT (x=4)** to (4,4) and eat the apple. This is the most immediate and rewarding move while keeping safety.\n\n---\n**RIGHT**",
