Since only one body segment is shown at (8,8), and moving RIGHT led us to the apple at (7,8), it's likely our head is at (6,8).  \n- The apple at (7,8) is directly to the RIGHT, safe and unoccupied.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,8) will result in eating the apple, increasing our length and points.\n- The other apples are farther away: at (6,0), (4,6), (9,3), (9,7), (2,4), which are not immediate priorities.\n- No immediate threat from enemy snake #0 at (3,6) or its body at (4,6).  \n- Moving UP to (6,9) isn't beneficial right now; it doesn't bring us closer to any apple and might lead us toward the top boundary.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,8) puts us away from the current apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (6,7): no nearby apple, less advantageous and potentially riskier if obstacles appear.\n\nSafety is paramount: moving RIGHT to (7,8) is directly onto an apple, safe, and aligns with our current goal.\n\nNext, I want to maintain control and plan to navigate toward other apples later, but for now, securing this apple is best.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"

Moving LEFT to (2,6) positions us directly above the apple, allowing a straight drop in two more moves. No immediate collision threats in that direction.\n\nStrategy for next turn: from (2,6) go DOWN twice to reach and eat the apple at (2,4), then reassess the next closest fruit.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
