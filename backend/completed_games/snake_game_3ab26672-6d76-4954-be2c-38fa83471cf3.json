Safe this turn (enemy head is far). Eating this apple grows me (longer tail), and it positions me to grab the upper-right apple cluster (e.g., (8,6) then work toward (7,8)/(7,9) and nearby apples).\n- LEFT -> (7,5): legal and safe this turn. Keeps more lateral options but doesn't immediately get an apple.\n- RIGHT -> (9,5): legal but moves onto the right edge, reducing escape routes next turn.\n\nEnemy head (5,2) possible moves: LEFT (4,2), DOWN (5,1), or UP (5,3). It cannot move into (6,2) because that's its own body. None of those threaten my immediate reachable squares (7,5), (8,6), or (9,5) this turn.\n\nAssessment and choice:\n- UP is the best move: it immediately collects the apple at (8,6), increases my score, and keeps several follow-up options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) next turn rather than pushing me into the wall. LEFT is safe but less rewarding; RIGHT hurts mobility. There is no realistic head-on collision risk from the enemy this turn.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (8,6) now. From there, prioritize the nearby upper-right apples (7,8), (7,9), (5,9) while avoiding hugging the right wall. Maintain distance from the enemy column around x=6; if the enemy commits to lower-left apples, sweep the upper-right cluster and keep at least two escape directions open each turn. Be careful about growth after eating (tail will linger), so avoid trying to reverse or squeeze through tight gaps immediately after an apple.\n\nUP",

The nearest high-value apples I can reach quickly are along y=8 at (2,8) and (1,8).

Their natural best moves next turn are toward (1,6) and then toward (0,7)/(1,6) apples, but I can take (1,8) now and be first to the top-left cluster.\n- Taking (1,8) now gains an apple and keeps me in a position with at least 2\u20133 safe follow-up moves. From (1,8) I can go down to (1,7) then left to (0,7) (apple), or up/around if the enemy approaches. This sequence both grows me and preserves escape options; it also forces the enemy to commit more moves to contest those apples.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns:\n- Eat (1,8) now. Then move toward (0,7) and (1,6) to secure the top-left cluster. If the enemy diverts upward aggressively, use the north corridor (y=9) to avoid head-on clashes and pick the (8,9) apple later or swing down to uncontested apples. Avoid moves that reduce my available safe exits to 1.\n\nLEFT",

However reaching (0,7) will take three moves and is directly contestable by the enemy (they can reach (0,7) in 3 moves as well from (2,6)). That risks a simultaneous head-to-head or a contested fight where I have the disadvantage (enemy already has more apples). After moving left I'll be forced to go down next (0,8) with few immediate alternate escapes, so I could become trapped in a contest.\n\nEvaluate RIGHT (2,9):\n- This keeps me in the top corridor and heads me toward the relatively uncontested apple at (8,9).\n- I will be somewhat constrained for the next couple of moves (moving right along the top row is essentially forced for a few turns because my body currently blocks dropping down), but that sequence is safe: moving into cells that will be vacated by my tail as we shift makes the right-run legal.\n- The enemy head (2,6) is a few rows away; their fastest path to the top (to threaten my top corridor) takes multiple turns. Staying on the top reduces immediate head-on risk versus diving to the left and contesting apples (which the opponent can reach faster).\n- Moving right also preserves the possibility of continuing along the top toward the apple at (8,9) or swinging down later into less-contested apples after the body clears.\n\nTactical decision:\n- Take RIGHT now to stay out of the contested left-column fights, keep distance from the enemy head, and work toward the top-row apple at (8,9). I'll accept the short forced right-run because it's safe (tail will vacate the cells I need) and it keeps me away from the enemy's immediate approach.\n\nShort plan for next few turns:\n- Continue along the top row toward (8,9), avoid dropping into columns near the enemy while they control the middle-left. If the enemy pushes up column 2-3 to contest the top, avoid head-on clashes and instead loop around to pick less-contested apples (4,5,5,4,6,5 area) while maintaining escape space.\n\nRIGHT",

Taking (9,9) keeps me on the open top row and positions me to take (9,7) soon (there is an apple at 9,7), then drop down to the center apples.\n\nRisk check:\n- No immediate head-on collision risk for RIGHT. Eating at (9,9) will prevent my tail from moving this turn (I grow), but my body already spans the top row from x=1..8 so extending to x=9 simply completes a contiguous top-row spine; I still have escape options by dropping down from x=9 in subsequent turns. DOWN is slightly safer positionally but yields no apple and moves me toward a denser area controlled by the enemy.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take (9,9) this turn.
