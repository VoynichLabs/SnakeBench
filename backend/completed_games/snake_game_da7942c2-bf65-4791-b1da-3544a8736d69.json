Assess Nearby Apples**\n- Let's calculate the distance (Manhattan) to each apple:\n    - (5,1): |5-4| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n    - (8,6): |8-4| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n    - (6,2): |6-4| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7\n    - (2,0): |2-4| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9\n    - (5,4): |5-4| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- Closest apple: (5,4), distance = 4\n- Next closest: (8,6), distance = 5\n\n**3. My Immediate Moves**\n- Up: (4,8) \u2014 open, not out of bounds, no apples.\n- Down: (4,6) \u2014 open, not out of bounds.\n- Left: (3,7) \u2014 open.\n- Right: (5,7) \u2014 open.\n\nAll four options are safe. Let's start heading towards the nearest apple at (5,4). To make progress, I need to decrease my y from 7 toward 4 and increase my x by 1.\n\n**4. Next Move Decision**\n- To get to (5,4), candidates:\n    - If I go down, I'm closer in y.\n    - If I go right, closer in x.\n\nFrom here, my reasoning:\n- Since my x is just 1 away, and y is 3 away, either down or right is valid. Both are open.\n- Let's start by going DOWN to (4,6) to close the vertical gap. Also, this keeps me central and flexible.\n\n**Strategy to remember for next turn:** \n- Keep heading toward (5,4) unless an enemy snake approaches or an apple spawns closer.\n- Monitor enemy snakes for collisions.\n\n**Decided Move:**  \nDOWN"

Which Apple is Closest Now?**\n- (5,4) is closest at distance 3.\n- (8,6) is next at distance 4.\n\n**4. Possible Moves from (4,6):**\n- UP: (4,7) \u2014 open, on the way to (5,4) only slightly, neither x nor y moving directly to (5,4).\n- DOWN: (4,5) \u2014 open, brings y closer to 4.\n- LEFT: (3,6) \u2014 open, but x moves away from (5,4) and (8,6).\n- RIGHT: (5,6) \u2014 open, increases x towards 5 (and 8,6).\n\n**5. Which Move Progresses toward Apple (5,4)?**\n- From (4,6) to (5,4): Need to get x up by 1 (to 5), y down by 2 (to 4).\n- If I go DOWN: (4,5). Now at (4,5), 1 away in x and 1 away in y from apple.\n- If I go RIGHT: (5,6). Now at (5,6), 2 away in y.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n- DOWN (to 4,5): on the next turn, I could go RIGHT (to 5,5), then DOWN to (5,4).\n- RIGHT (to 5,6): then I could go DOWN twice (to 5,5 then 5,4).\n\nBoth approaches are equally direct: Reach (5,5) in 2 steps, then (5,4).\n\nBut after going RIGHT, I'm also directly on the same row as the (8,6) apple, so if (5,4) gets grabbed by someone else, (8,6) is next closest.\n\n**6. Do I Need to Worry about Snake 0?**\n- Snake 0 is at (6,3), not in range to contest (5,4) or (8,6) right now.\n\n**7. Compare Potential Next Step Benefits:**\n- RIGHT puts me at (5,6), which is adjacent to both (5,4) after going down, and gives direct access to (8,6) if needed.\n- RIGHT also puts me \"off center\" in that row, but no threats nearby.\n- DOWN keeps me centered as well, but requires an extra x move.\n\n**Strategy** (for future): \n- If no snake is nearby, always try to move so that you keep more apple options in line.\n- After getting (5,4), continue towards (8,6) if possible.\n\n**Decided Move:**  \nRIGHT"

Which move gets me closer to (5,4)?**\n- DOWN to (5,5): then DOWN again to (5,4) (the apple).\n- No blockers in that path.\n\n**6. Which move gets me closer to (8,6)?**\n- RIGHT to (6,6), then RIGHT again to (7,6), then RIGHT again to (8,6). \n- Current location is equidistant in terms of steps to both apples after this move:\n    - (5,6) to (5,4): DOWN, DOWN\n    - (5,6) to (8,6): RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT\n\n**7. Is there risk from other snake?**\n- Enemy is not near either (5,4) or (8,6) and not between me and those apples.\n\n**8. Should I prioritize (5,4) or (8,6)?**\n- (5,4) is closer (2 moves), so best to go for that first unless danger is sensed (none currently).\n- After that, (8,6) would then be closest next.\n\n**9. Should I go UP for safety or DOWN for the apple?**\n- DOWN makes progress to (5,4), with no threat.\n- RIGHT would be a switch to favor the (8,6) apple. However, since (5,4) is closer, and if I move RIGHT now and someone grabs (5,4), I will regret missing the quick easy apple.\n- LEFT makes no sense (away from apples).\n- UP is just stalling, doesn\u2019t help.\n\n**10. Any benefit to waiting or zig-zagging?**\n- None \u2014 no threats, no race. Fastest to (5,4) is DOWN.\n\n**In summary:**  \nDOWN is unblocked, fastest path to (5,4), and then can immediately get back on track towards (8,6).\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nAfter grabbing (5,4), re-evaluate for (8,6) or (5,1) as next best targets. Continue to avoid enemy snake, but they are not a threat presently.\n\n---\n\n**Decided Move:**  \nDOWN"

Where are the apples now?\n- (8,6)\n- (2,0)\n- (3,0)\n- (1,3)\n- (1,0)\n\nNo more apple at (5,4) \u2014 I just ate it.\n\n## 3. My possible moves from (5,4):\n\n### Let's check available directions:\n- **UP (5,5):** that's where my body just was and is now (since I grew), so can't go back.\n- **DOWN (5,3):** Board position, within bounds, is empty.\n- **LEFT (4,4):** Empty, in-bounds.\n- **RIGHT (6,4):** Empty, in-bounds.\n\nSo three possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n## 4. Enemy proximity/safety:\n\nWhere is Snake #0?  \n- Head at (5,1), body at (5,2), (6,2)\n- Snake #0 is far below; moving DOWN is safe for now (would go to (5,3)), but it would take another turn to get to where the enemy could ever threaten me (not adjacent now).  \n- All adjacent squares are unoccupied (besides my own tail at (5,5)), so all available moves are safe.\n\n## 5. Where are the apples now, and how close am I?\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- (8,6): dx=3, dy=2 \u21d2 5 moves away\n- (2,0): dx=3, dy=4 \u21d2 7 moves away\n- (3,0): dx=2, dy=4 \u21d2 6 moves away\n- (1,3): dx=4, dy=1 \u21d2 5 moves away\n- (1,0): dx=4, dy=4 \u21d2 8 moves away\n\nAll apples are fairly far, mostly on the lower left (columns 0\u20133, rows 0\u20133), and one at (8,6) top right.\n\nThe closest to me are:\n- (1,3): (down then left)\n- (3,0): (down-left-down-down)\n- (8,6): (right-up-up-right-right)\n- All roughly equal in terms of minimum distance.\n\n**Note:** The easiest to generally track is (8,6) \u2014 it's furthest from the enemy and other apples, less likely to be raced for.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,1): closest for them is (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), but they're also not yet at those.\n\n## 6. Next move planning\n\n### Option 1: Continue DOWN (to (5,3))\n- Puts me closer to the left-lower apples, but also gets a bit closer to the enemy's likely vector (they are at (5,1)).\n\n### Option 2: LEFT (to (4,4))\n- Moves me closer to (1,3), (3,0), potentially keeps distance from enemy.\n\n### Option 3: RIGHT (to (6,4))\n- Moves me a bit further from the cluster of apples, but toward (8,6) (which is generally \"out of the way\").\n\n### Which route is less risky?\n- DOWN: heads toward where the enemy is below. Would put me eventually near the enemy if we both go toward the left-bottom apples.\n- LEFT: safer, drift toward the cluster at (1,3), (1,0), and (3,0) and have lateral options next turn.\n- RIGHT: open corridor, go toward (8,6), but it's only one apple and not a cluster.\n\n### Other considerations\n- My tail is at (5,5), not on my projected path if moving LEFT or DOWN.\n- All adjacent squares currently open, so not boxed in.\n\n## 7. Summary\n\n- **LEFT** (to (4,4)) gives me the most flexibility: avoids immediately heading toward the enemy, positions me to move DOWN or continue LEFT next turn, and moves closer to the largest group of apples.  \n- IF the enemy moves toward (2,0)/(3,0)/(1,0), being further up and left gives me a better position to cut them off or stay safe.\n- **DOWN** is slightly riskier because the enemy is in that column below.\n- **RIGHT** only makes sense if exclusively going for (8,6), which is less efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- If no immediate threat, keep aiming for the cluster of apples at lower left (via LEFT/DOWN as possible).  \n- Keep an eye on the enemy's direction (are they going left toward apples, or right?).  \n- Avoid head-to-head path with the enemy snake; take routes with more escape options.\n\n---\n\n**Decided Move:**  \nLEFT"

Assess enemy threat\n\n- Enemy is at (5,1). \n- No immediate collision risk; I'm well above, can ignore for now but keep in mind.\n\n### 4.

Safety of LEFT\n\n- (3,4) is empty, not occupied.\n- LEFT does not put me near walls yet.\n- No immediate risk from enemy.\n\n### 7. Strategy and Look Ahead\n\n- By going LEFT, I'll line up to continue pursuing (1,3), then route down for other apples as they become available or snapped up.\n- Keep distance from Snake #0, monitor their position if they start racing down/left.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn strategy note:**  \nIf the enemy begins to go left as well, try to claim (1,3) soon and then shift downward, possibly prioritizing (3,0) over (1,0) if the enemy aims for the far-left apples.\n\n---\n\n## Decided Move\n\n**LEFT**"

My Current Situation\n\n- **My head:** (3,4) *(after last move LEFT)*\n- **My body:** [(4,4)]  *(tail will move to this square if I do not eat an apple this turn)*\n- I am moving through open space towards the cluster of apples on the left/bottom side.\n- **Enemy snake:** Now at (4,0), with body at [(5,0), (5,1)]\u2014they are low and right on the board, not a current direct conflict.\n\n## 2. Valid Moves from (3,4):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,5):** Open, inbounds\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,3):** Open, inbounds\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,4):** Open, inbounds\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,4):** Occupied by my own body ([4,4]) (unless tail moves), but this would be moving backwards, which is not allowed.\n\n**Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT**\n\n## 3. Apple Distances\n\n**Current apples:** (8,6), (2,0), (3,0), (1,3), (1,0)\n- (1,3) is our closest, 2 left and one down from here.\n\n### Options from (3,4):\n\n- **LEFT (2,4):** Gets me closer to (1,3).\n    - Next turn: LEFT again then DOWN to arrive at (1,3).\n- **DOWN (3,3):** Not optimal\u2014would need to go further left or down, and then left anyway (less direct to the apples left-lower).\n- **UP (3,5):** No apples above, moves away from cluster and away from current targets.\n\n## 4. Potential Threats\n\n- Enemy snake remains on bottom row and not headed toward the left apple cluster (they are at (4,0)), so the lower apples could be in contest, but (1,3) is uncontested.\n\n## 5. What's the Shortest Path to (1,3)?\n\nFrom (3,4):  \n- **LEFT** to (2,4)\n- **LEFT** to (1,4)\n- **DOWN** to (1,3)\n\n## 6. Safety\n\n- (2,4) is unoccupied.\n- No walls nearby.\n- Enemy is not near this path at all.\n\n## 7. Next Turn Planning\n\n- Plan to continue LEFT again and then DOWN as long as the apples remain and board stays clear.\n- After (1,3), continue down to (1,0) if uncontested, then traverse to (2,0) or (3,0), maximizing apple collection.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **LEFT** is the safest, most direct route to the nearest apple and lines me up for more apples next.\n- Maintain situational awareness of enemy in bottom rows.\n\n---\n\n**Next Turn Strategy Note:**  \nIf (1,3) remains after I move to (2,4), continue pursuing it. If it disappears (collected or blocked), reevaluate for (1,0), (2,0) or (3,0) as the next closest apple and avoid moving DOWN too soon where the enemy may come up from below.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision\n\n**LEFT**"

However, there's a risk of collision if they move down.\n\nLooking at safer alternatives:\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 0) puts me in the corner, which could be a trap later\n- The apple at (6, 1) is relatively close and would take me away from the enemy snake\n- The apple at (8, 0) is further but keeps me on the bottom row\n\nI think the safest and most strategic move is UP to (1, 1). This gets me out of the bottom edge and starts me toward the apple at (1, 5). The enemy snake would have to move down twice to reach (1, 1), and I can monitor their movement.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (1, 1), assess the enemy snake's position. If they move away from column 1, continue UP toward the apple at (1, 5). If they move toward me, consider going RIGHT toward the apple at (6, 1) to avoid collision.\n\nUP"
