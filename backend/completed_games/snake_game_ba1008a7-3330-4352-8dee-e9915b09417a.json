No walls or bodies are restricting movement at the moment.  \n   - My snake (#1) is at `(0, 3)`, so I have full room to move in all directions except outside the boundaries. I have no body to avoid yet.  \n   - There are **five apples** on the board at `(1, 3)`, `(0, 4)`, `(4, 8)`, `(6, 8)`, and `(6, 6)`.  \n\n2) **Apple Prioritization**  \n   - The apples `(1, 3)` and `(0, 4)` are the closest to my current position.  \n     - The apple `(1, 3)` is *adjacent* to my current position to the right. It's the shortest path and a guaranteed next turn growth.  \n     - The apple `(0, 4)` is directly above me. It would take me two moves to grab after `(1, 3)` if nothing changes.  \n\n3) **Enemy Snake**  \n   - Snake #0 is at `(8, 7)`. It\u2019s far away from the nearest apples and poses no immediate threat. There is no need to take defensive action at this moment.  \n\n4) **Strategy for This Turn**  \n   - The **safest, simplest, and most efficient** move is to grab the apple at `(1, 3)`, which is to my right. This will grow my snake and give me 1 point.  \n   - My **next turn** will likely involve moving **UP** toward `(0, 4)` after securing the apple at `(1, 3)`, but I will reevaluate based on the updated board state after this turn.  \n\n### Decision:\nI will move **RIGHT** to `(1, 3)` and prioritize the adjacent apple.  \n\n**Next move:** RIGHT"

For now, the only body segment to worry about is `(1, 3)` below and eventually `(0, 4)` since the tail will move on my next move.\n\n2. **Remaining Apples:**\n   - Apples are located at:\n     - **(4, 8), (6, 8), (6, 6), and (2, 9):**\n       - These are all farther away. My next move should aim to set me on a path to the nearest apple to maximize my score efficiently.\n     - **Nearest Apple:**\n       - The closest apple to me is **(2, 9)**.  \n       - My current path strategy should focus on gradually moving toward (2, 9) while avoiding unnecessary risks.

Its position doesn\u2019t threaten me yet. However, it could move toward the apples at `(6, 6)` or `(6, 8)`, so I should reach closer apples **(2, 9)** or strategically stay ahead of them.\n\n4. **The Board:**\n   - As the board size is limited (10x10), I must ensure I don\u2019t accidentally trap myself near walls or body segments as I continue to grow.\n\n---\n\n#### **Immediate Move Options**\n- **UP to (0, 5):**\n  - This is a safe move because it keeps me away from my body segment `(1, 3)` and moves me closer vertically toward the direction of **(2, 9)**.\n  - This starts setting a path to collect apples farther away.\n\n- **RIGHT to (1, 4):**\n  - This moves me back toward my body segment `(1, 3)` and doesn\u2019t make progress toward the nearest apple. It\u2019s a bad move.\n\n- **LEFT to (-1, 4):**\n  - This is outside the board and leads to death. Not an option.\n\n- **DOWN to (0, 3):**\n  - This would immediately run into my own growing body. A collision with my tail will kill me. Bad decision.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy for This Turn**\nThe only viable move is to go **UP** to `(0, 5)` to stay safe and continue moving toward the nearest apple at `(2, 9)`. It keeps me in good positioning for future moves and avoids any immediate risk.\n\n#### **Strategy for Future Turns**\n1. Next turn, I can proceed toward `(2, 9)` via the following routes:\n   - If I turn **LEFT, UP, or RIGHT**, I\u2019ll adjust based on potential obstacles or optimal positioning.\n2.

          "rationale": "### **Thinking Out Loud**\n\n#### **Current Position and Board State Analysis:**\n1. **My Snake Position:**\n   - My current head is at `(1, 6)` after the last move **UP**.\n   - My body is at `[(1, 5)]`. This means there is no immediate threat of self-collision as long as I don\u2019t move directly back **DOWN** to `(1, 5)`.\n\n2. **Apples:**\n   - Apples are located at:\n     - **(0, 4):** Closest apple. This is below my current position but requires me to navigate carefully to avoid doubling back on myself immediately.\n     - **(4, 8), (6, 8), (9, 8):** These apples are much further away and less practical to pursue for now.\n     - **(2, 9):** This apple is closer but still involves multiple moves and facing potential competition. \n   - **Target Priority:** While `(2, 9)` is the nearest destination in the upward direction, **(0, 4)** is still the geographically closest apple overall. However, it\u2019s tricky to reach safely without retracing my body.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake (Snake #0):**\n   - Enemy Snake is at `(6, 7)` with its body at `[(6, 6)]`.\n   - It\u2019s likely moving toward the group of apples near `(4, 8)` and `(6, 8)` since those are closer to its position. No immediate lethal threat from it.\n\n4. **Board Mapping and Risks:**\n   - Moving **UP** to `(1, 7)` keeps my trajectory open toward either `(2, 9)` or the apples further on top of the board.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to `(2, 6)` keeps the broader area accessible to me but doesn\u2019t progress meaningfully toward any specific apple.\n   - Moving **DOWN** to `(1, 5)` runs into my own body and is therefore a deadly option.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to `(0, 6)` gives me access to **(0, 4)** if I plan to loop around safely. It also keeps my options open for **UPWARD** movement toward `(2, 9)` later.\n\n---\n\n#### **Pathfinding to Apples**\n- **Path to (2, 9):**\n  - Best route involves temporarily moving **UP** and perhaps shifting **RIGHT** later to align closer to `(2, 9)`. This apple is safe to pursue for now as there are no competing snakes near it.\n- **Path to (0, 4):**\n  - This requires moving **LEFT** to `(0, 6)`. Afterward, I can safely navigate downward toward `(0, 4)`. However, I must balance this against the risk of getting too close to my existing body trail without proper maneuvering space.\n\n---\n\n#### **Move Options and Analysis**\n1. **UP to `(1, 7)`**:\n   - Keeps me moving safely upward and aligns toward the apple at `(2, 9)`. Avoids collisions with my own body or walls. It also provides future flexibility to either veer **RIGHT** or maneuver safely.\n\n2. **LEFT to `(0, 6)`**:\n   - Aligns toward `(0, 4)` for an early apple grab. This is a valid option, but it risks putting me into a difficult positioning against my body if I need to loop upward later. Only worth considering if I\u2019m confident in planning ahead.\n\n3. **RIGHT to `(2, 6)`**:\n   - Doesn\u2019t progress meaningfully toward any apple and sacrifices the current progress toward `(2, 9)` or `(0, 4)`.\n\n4. **DOWN to `(1, 5)`**:\n   - Immediate death.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision and Strategy**\nAfter weighing the options, the best move for now is **UP to (1, 7)**. This progresses safely toward the apple at `(2, 9)` while keeping my future maneuverability flexible. It also avoids any unnecessary risks associated with looping toward `(0, 4)` too soon.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Strategy:**\n1. Continue monitoring the safe path to `(2, 9)` or decide to pivot toward `(0, 4)` if the situation changes (e.g., needing to avoid blocking myself in).\n2. Keep an eye on the enemy snake\u2019s position, especially as it approaches other apples to ensure it doesn\u2019t become a threat later.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move:**\n**UP** to `(1, 7)`"

This could risk trapping me in a situation too close to my own body, especially as I grow.\n     - Becomes more viable later if I plan to navigate around my current position carefully.\n\n   - Apple at `(2, 9)`:\n     - **Closest reachable apple in the upward direction.** This is 2 moves away if I continue **UP** and then **RIGHT** (to `(2, 9)`).\n     - No significant threat from enemy Snake #0, as it is far away from this apple.\n\n   - Apples at `(4, 8)`, `(9, 8)`, `(6, 8)`:\n     - These are farther from my current position and should only be considered after collecting closer apples or as backup goals.\n\n   - **Target Priority:**\n     - `(2, 9)` is the safest and most immediate goal, aligning with my current trajectory upward. \n     - `(0, 4)` can be considered later after planning for safe maneuverability.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake:**\n   - Snake #0 is at `(6, 8)`:\n     - Its head is far from my current position and is unlikely to interfere with either the apple at `(2, 9)` or `(0, 4)` in the immediate future.\n     - It is likely prioritizing apples near `(6, 8)` or `(4, 8)`, so it doesn\u2019t pose an immediate threat to me.\n\n4. **Pathfinding and Risk Assessment:**\n   - Safe paths to `(2, 9)`:\n     - Continue **UP** to `(1, 8)`, then step **RIGHT** to `(2, 9)`.\n   - Safe paths to `(0, 4)`:\n     - Move **LEFT** to `(0, 6)`, then reorient downward carefully to avoid self-trapping.

It allows me to approach the apple at `(2, 9)` in just 2 moves while keeping my position safe for future turns. It also avoids unnecessary risk or delays.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Strategy:**\n1. **Next Turn:**\n   - After moving **UP**, I can move **RIGHT** to easily collect the apple at `(2, 9)`. No competition or risk is present near this apple.\n2. **Post-Apple Collection:**\n   - If I successfully collect the apple at `(2, 9)`, my size will increase, which slightly limits maneuverability.\n   - Re-assess positions of other apples and Snake #0 to decide whether to target `(0, 4)` next or pursue another apple within safe positioning.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Move:**\n**UP**"

At this point, there is no threat of **collision** or **denial** of apples from Snake #0.\n\n4. **Pathfinding and Movement Safety:**\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to `(2, 9)` is the **optimal play** this turn:\n     - It allows me to consume the apple cleanly.\n     - I will grow my snake by 1 segment, extending the body to `[(1, 9), (1, 8)]` while positioning the head at `(2, 9)`.\n   - Alternative moves would be unsafe or ineffective:\n     - **UP**: Going up is illegal since `(1, 10)` is outside the board.\n     - **LEFT**: Moves me away from the apple and wastes time unnecessarily.\n     - **DOWN**: Would result in a **collision** with my own body.\n\n---\n\n### **Move Options and Evaluation**\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to `(2, 9)`**:\n   - This allows me to consume the apple and grow safely.\n   - Keeps the snake aligned within the safest part of the board while preparing for the next target.\n\n2. **Move LEFT to `(0, 9)`**:\n   - Wasteful and ineffective. This takes me further away from the nearest apple and creates unnecessary steps.\n\n3. **Move DOWN to `(1, 8)`**:\n   - **Immediately suicidal** as I would collide with my own body.\n\n---\n\n#### **Decision and Strategy**\n\n- **Next Move:** **RIGHT**  \n  This is the **optimal and logical move** to consume the apple at `(2, 9)`. It ensures I grow while staying safe from enemy interference or other threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Future Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n1. **After Consuming `(2, 9)`**:\n   - Reassess the position of the remaining apples:\n     - If the board remains clear and Snake #0 is no close threat, prioritize **closest apples** (e.g., `(2, 5)` or `(0, 4)`).\n   - Consider which paths remain safest as the snake grows longer.\n   \n2. **Keep Maneuverability in Mind:**\n   - Avoid putting myself into tight or cornered spaces.\n   - Continue observing Snake #0\u2019s trajectory to ensure mutual non-interference.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move:** **RIGHT**"

It is:\n     - Accessible in just **3 steps**.\n     - Risk-free (no obstacles currently blocking the path).\n   - The apple at `(3, 4)` is slightly farther and would require moving **diagonally**, which makes it less efficient to target at this stage.

This restricts future options.\n   - **Suboptimal.**\n\n4. **RIGHT**:\n   - New position: `(3, 8)`.\n   - This completely deviates from the shortest path to any nearby apples and moves toward Snake #0\u2019s position (potentially increasing risk in future turns).\n   - **Unnecessary risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for This Turn and the Next**\n\n- **Immediate Goal:**\n  My next move will be **DOWN** to work toward the apple at `(2, 5)`.\n  \n- **Future Plan:**\n  - After consuming the apple at `(2, 5)`, target `(3, 4)` as the next closest apple unless Snake #0 moves aggressively toward apples in the top-left quadrant.\n  - Stay in the central columns of the board (e.g., columns 2\u20134) to maintain flexibility and avoid cornering myself.\n\n### **Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**"

Apples on the Board:**\n- Apples available: `(0, 4)`, `(9, 8)`, `(2, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(7, 3)`.\n- Apple `(2, 5)` is directly below my current position, requiring just **2 moves downward**.\n  - It's the closest apple on the board, and the path is entirely clear.\n- Apple `(3, 4)` is also reasonably close but farther in terms of the overall path compared to `(2, 5)`.\n\n#### **3. Enemy Snake (#0):**\n- Enemy snake's current head: `(6, 9)`.\n- Body occupies: `[(5, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)]`.\n- Snake #0 is located in the top-right area and currently poses no threat to me. It\u2019s unlikely to interfere with the apples I am targeting anytime soon.\n\n#### **4. Obstacles:**\n- No immediate obstacles in my planned path. The board is clear below me.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Possible Moves**\n#### **UP**\n- **Resulting Position:** `(2, 8)`.\n- **Consequence:** I would move backward into my own body, which is a guaranteed game-ending collision.\n- **Invalid Move.**\n\n#### **DOWN**\n- **Resulting Position:** `(2, 6)`.\n- **Consequence:** This move takes me closer to the apple at `(2, 5)`. The path downward is safe, and reaching the apple in 2 moves is almost guaranteed.\n- **Optimal Move.**\n\n#### **LEFT**\n- **Resulting Position:** `(1, 7)`.\n- **Consequence:** Moving left doesn't offer any immediate advantage and takes me farther from any apples. Additionally, it restricts my position in case I need to maneuver toward a better target later.\n- **Suboptimal Move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT**\n- **Resulting Position:** `(3, 7)`.\n- **Consequence:** Moving right will take me farther away from the apple at `(2, 5)` and doesn\u2019t align with any strategic goal. It also increases proximity to the enemy snake's head in future turns.\n- **Suboptimal Move.**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for This Turn and the Future**\n1. **Immediate Goal:** Move closer to the apple at `(2, 5)` in the straightest and safest path possible.\n   - My next move will be **DOWN**.\n   - I will reach `(2, 6)` after this move.\n  \n2. **Future Plan:**\n   - In 1 additional move, I will reach `(2, 5)` and consume the apple.\n   - Afterward, the next closest apple is likely `(3, 4)`. I will re-evaluate the board after consuming `(2, 5)`.\n\n3. **General Planning:**\n   - Stay in the central parts of the board (columns around 2\u20134) to maintain flexibility and avoid getting cornered.\n   - Monitor the enemy snake's head and path to ensure my apple targets remain uncontested.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**"

Additionally, heading up allows fewer options to turn without intersecting my body in subsequent moves.  \n- **Verdict:** **Suboptimal Move.**\n\n#### **DOWN**\n- **Position After Move:** `(3, 4)`.  \n- **Consequence:** Moving down to `(3, 4)` will immediately result in capturing the apple. This advances my progress toward winning and expands my size by 1 segment.  \n- **Verdict:** **Optimal Move.**\n\n#### **LEFT**\n- **Position After Move:** `(2, 5)`.  \n- **Consequence:** Moving left will run into my own body, causing the game to end.  \n- **Verdict:** **Invalid Move.**\n\n#### **RIGHT**\n- **Position After Move:** `(4, 5)`.  \n- **Consequence:** Moving right takes me farther from the closest apple `(3, 4)` and creates unnecessary inefficiency in reaching my target.  \n- **Verdict:** **Suboptimal Move.**\n\n---\n\n### **Decision and Strategy**\n- The optimal move is **DOWN** to reach the apple at `(3, 4)`.  \n- Upon capturing the apple:\n  1. My new head will be at `(3, 4)`.\n  2. My body will grow by 1 segment, with the tail shifting accordingly.  \n  3. I will briefly re-evaluate for the next closest apple and plan my moves around avoiding self-intersection or traps.\n\n- **Future Planning:** The next closest apples after `(3, 4)` are `(7, 3)` and `(4, 2)`. My focus after consuming `(3, 4)` will be realigning with one of those apples depending on Snake #0's movement and proximity.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**"

Target Apple Locations\nThe apple locations are as follows:\n  - **(0, 4):** 4 steps left, 3 steps down. This apple is somewhat far and requires diagonal movement.\n  - **(7, 3):** 3 steps right, same row as my current position. This apple is reachable but currently farther than my closest target.\n  - **(4, 2):** *Directly below me (1 step). This is the closest apple.*\n  - **(4, 0):** Also directly below me but farther (3 steps down).\n  - **(1, 9):** This apple is in a distant corner and requires 10+ moves, making it the least optimal target right now.\n\n- **Closest Apple:** (4, 2).  \n  This apple is the easiest and safest to reach with my next move.\n\n#### 3. Movements and Obstacles\n- **UP:**  \n  - Moves me to (4, 4), which is already occupied by my body.  \n  - **Result:** Self-collision. **Not valid.**\n\n- **DOWN:**  \n  - Moves me to (4, 2), directly onto the closest apple.  \n  - Outcome: I will grow, and my score will increase by 1.  \n  - **Result:** This is a valid and optimal move.\n\n- **LEFT:**  \n  - Moves me to (3, 3).  \n  - Outcome: This does not bring me closer to my target apple and positions me near my existing body part at (3, 4), which could risk self-collision in subsequent turns.  \n  - **Result:** Suboptimal move.\n\n- **RIGHT:**  \n  - Moves me to (5, 3).  \n  - Outcome: This takes me farther away from the closest apple at (4, 2). It does not serve any strategic purpose at this time.  \n  - **Result:** Suboptimal move.\n\n#### 4. Enemy Snake Analysis\n- Snake #0's head is at (8, 7), which is too far away to affect me right now. It remains confined to the top-right corner of the board and poses no immediate threat.\n\n#### 5. Other Considerations\n- After moving **DOWN** and eating the apple at **(4, 2)**, my next focus will be on subsequent apples. Likely candidates are:\n  - (7, 3): Closest horizontally, requiring 3 steps right and 1 step directly down.\n  - (0, 4): Located on the far-left side of the board but reachable depending on enemy movement.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. Move toward the apple at (4, 2).  \n2. Reassess based on the new state of the board after I grow.  \n3.

Current Snake Status\n**My Head:** (4, 2)  \n**My Body:** [(4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5)]  \n\nI\u2019ve grown from the previous turn after eating the apple at **(4, 2)** and have now become longer. My head is now at (4, 2), and my body extends behind me, forming an \"L\" shape.\n\n##### Implications for Movement:\nMy growing body makes movement slightly more complex, as I need to avoid running into my own tail. Additionally, optimal navigation toward the next apple requires recalculating shorter paths while avoiding self-collision.\n\n#### 2. Target Apple Locations:\nThe updated board and apple locations are:\n- **(0, 4):** Four steps left, two steps up.  \n- **(7, 3):** Three steps right, one step up.  \n- **(1, 9):** Far top-left corner.  \n- **(2, 7):** Six steps left, five steps up.\n\n##### Closest Apples:\nSince I just consumed the apple at (4, 2), the next closest apple is at **(7, 3)**. This apple is only three steps to the right and one step down from my current location, and is the most optimal target for my next move sequence.\n\n#### 3. Movements and Obstacles:\nThe key here is to determine the safe moves given that my own body creates obstacles nearby. Let\u2019s evaluate each possible move:\n\n- **UP (to (4, 3)):**  \n  - This leads directly back into my own body.  \n  - **Result:** Self-collision. **NOT VALID**  \n\n- **DOWN (to (4, 1)):**  \n  - This moves me away from my primary apple target at (7, 3).  \n  - While safe, it is an inefficient move and adds unnecessary distance to my journey.  \n  - **Result:** Suboptimal but valid.\n\n- **LEFT (to (3, 2)):**  \n  - This moves me toward my own body segment at (3, 3), making future navigation tricky.  \n  - Additionally, it moves me farther from the target apple at (7, 3).  \n  - **Result:** Risky and suboptimal. **NOT PREFERRED**\n\n- **RIGHT (to (5, 2)):**  \n  - This brings me one step closer to the apple at (7, 3).  \n  - It\u2019s a safe move away from my body and keeps me on track toward my next apple.  \n  - **Result:** Optimal move.\n\n#### 4. Enemy Snake #0:\nSnake #0\u2019s head is still at (8, 6), far enough away that it does not pose an immediate threat. There is no indication that it is targeting the same apple at (7, 3), but I will continue to monitor its movements in subsequent turns.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. Move **RIGHT** toward the apple at (7, 3).  \n2. Continue monitoring the path to ensure no self-collision as my body grows.  \n3. After eating the apple at (7, 3), reevaluate the situation to target either (0, 4) or (2, 7) depending on board state and obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

For the next turn, evaluate:  \n   - Whether the apple at (7, 3) is still uncontested by Snake #0.  \n   - My options to ensure I don\u2019t trap myself when I grow further after eating the apple.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:  \nIf I successfully reach (7, 3) and consume the apple:  \n- **Reprioritize apple targets** based on new positions and safety considerations.  \n- Consider turning downward (if Snake #0 presents no threat) to head toward newly viable apples.  \n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **RIGHT**"

This is a **medium-priority target**.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Threat Analysis from Snake #0:**  \n- Snake #0 remains distant.

Still, I should remain vigilant if its head trends toward newly viable apples in future turns.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Obstacle and Movement Analysis:**  \n##### Potential Moves:  \n1. **UP (to (7, 4)):**  \n   - This move travels along the open board space into no immediate danger.  \n   - However, moving upward does not immediately orient me toward my next target.  \n\n2. **DOWN (to (7, 2)):**  \n   - This move reverts back to my own body.  \n   - Result: **Collision \u2013 Not valid.**  \n\n3. **LEFT (to (6, 3)):**  \n   - Moving left immediately sets up my path toward the **(4, 0)** apple.  \n   - It avoids any immediate collision concerns.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (8, 3)):**  \n   - Moving right moves me away from any viable apple.  \n   - This avoids my body temporarily but does not progress toward any effective goal.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Strategy for This Turn**  \nI will move **LEFT to (6, 3)** to position myself toward the apple at **(4, 0)**. This is a logical next step based on proximity and safety.  \n\nAfter this move, I will reassess depending on the enemy snake's actions and the board state.  \n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **LEFT**"

Updated Snake Status:**  \n- Current head position: **(6, 3)** \u2014 After the previous move, I have moved left from (7, 3) and my head is now at (6, 3).  \n- Updated body position:  \n  **[(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)]**.  \n\nThis positioning leaves me in a moderately safe area where I can continue towards viable targets while avoiding a collision with myself.  \n\n#### **2. Apples Remaining Locations:**  \nThe apples still available on the board are:  \n- **(0, 4)**  \n- **(4, 0)**  \n- **(1, 9)**  \n- **(2, 7)**  \n- **(4, 7)**  \n\n#### **3. Initial Risk Assessment:**  \nThe biggest risk for this turn is potentially cutting myself off from a clear path to apples while avoiding my own increasingly long tail. Snake #0 remains far from me, so I do not need to react to its movements just yet.  \n\n#### **4. Apple Targeting and Optimal Paths:**  \nI will now assess the apples and their accessibility.  \n\n---\n\n##### (4, 0):  \n- **Distance:** 2 steps left and 3 steps down.  \n- **Path:** Move LEFT and then DOWN x3.  \n- **Risk:** This apple is close and in a safe direction. I can easily move toward it without hitting my body. This remains a **high-priority target**.   \n\n---\n\n##### (0, 4):  \n- **Distance:** 6 steps left and 1 step up.  \n- **Path:** Move LEFT consistently.  \n- **Risk:** While this apple is fairly far, moving toward it early could be risky because it increases the possibility of trapping myself along the bottom wall. This remains a **low-priority target** for now.  \n\n---\n\n##### (1, 9):  \n- **Distance:** 5 steps left and 6 steps up.  \n- **Path:** Move UP x6, then LEFT.  \n- **Risk:** Very far and unnecessary to prioritize right now, as no other snake is nearby to collect it. I will continue to deprioritize this apple.  \n\n---\n\n##### (2, 7):  \n- **Distance:** 4 steps left and 4 steps up.  \n- **Path:** Move UP x4, then LEFT.  \n- **Risk:** This apple is moderately accessible and lies in a safe direction. It\u2019s an option, but it\u2019s secondary due to increased risk versus **(4, 0)**. **Medium-priority target**.  \n\n---\n\n##### (4, 7):  \n- **Distance:** 2 steps left and 4 steps up.  \n- **Path:** Move UP x4, then LEFT x2.  \n- **Risk:** Similar to (2, 7), but this is very close after I collect some other apples like (4, 0). **Medium-priority target**.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Plan for This Move**  \n- My priority remains **(4, 0)** because it is close, safe, and moving there avoids complicating my positioning.  \n- I will move **LEFT** toward **(5, 3)** to gradually progress toward (4, 0).  \n\n---\n\n#### **6. Obstacle and Movement Analysis for This Move**  \nI\u2019ll evaluate all possible moves from my current position:  \n\n1. **UP (to (6, 4)):**  \n   - This move does not progress me toward (4, 0). It also risks moving toward Snake #0\u2019s head (though it is far away for now).  \n   - Not optimal based on my objectives.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (6, 2)):**  \n   - This move is unsafe because it moves toward my own tail and would trap me with no escape.  \n   - **Invalid move**.  \n\n3. **LEFT (to (5, 3)):**  \n   - Safely moves me closer to the apple at (4, 0).  \n   - The space at (5, 3) is completely open and avoids trapping myself.  \n   - Best option for progress toward my goal.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (7, 3)):**  \n   - This move takes me backward and away from my target. It also risks wasting turns.  \n   - Not ideal.  \n\nThus, my best choice for this turn is **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Future Turns  \n- After reaching (4, 0), I will reassess the board. I will likely pivot toward **(0, 4)** or **(4, 7)**, depending on remaining threats and Snake #0\u2019s behavior.  \n- I need to remain vigilant of my growing tail, especially as my snake becomes longer.  \n\n---\n\n### Decided Next Move: **LEFT**"

Still an option after reaching (4, 0).  \n- **Priority:** **Low \u2013 Postpone for now.**  \n\n---\n\n##### **(1, 9):**  \n- **Proximity:** 4 steps left and 6 steps up (total: 10 steps).    \n- **Risk:** No other snake is nearby to collect it, so deprioritizing this distant apple is reasonable.  \n- **Priority:** **Low \u2013 Ignore for now.**\n\n---\n\n##### **(2, 7):**  \n- **Proximity:** 3 steps left and 4 steps up (total: 7 steps).  \n- **Risk:** Safely collectible from above, but secondary in importance to (4, 0).  \n- **Priority:** **Medium Priority.**  \n\n---\n\n##### **(4, 7):**  \n- **Proximity:** 1 step left and 4 steps up (total: 5 steps).  \n- **Risk:** Path remains clear, but this apple competes with (4, 0). I\u2019ll go here only after claiming (4, 0).  \n- **Priority:** **Medium Priority.**  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Movement Options from (5, 3)**  \nI\u2019ll review the four possible moves:  \n\n1. **UP (to (5, 4)):**  \n   - Takes me further from my immediate target, (4, 0).  \n   - No benefit. Not optimal.  \n\n2. **DOWN (to (5, 2)):**  \n   - Dangerously close to my body. Increases the risk of becoming boxed in.  \n   - **Unsafe. Invalid move.**  \n\n3. **LEFT (to (4, 3)):**  \n   - Safely progresses toward the apple at (4, 0).  \n   - Avoids tail collision and prepares for downward movement next turn.  \n   - **Best move.**  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (6, 3)):**  \n   - Moves backward into my own body, resulting in an immediate loss.  \n   - **Invalid move.**  \n\n---\n\n#### **6.

Current Snake Status**  \n- **My Head Position:** (3, 3) (updated after my last move to the left).  \n- **Body Configuration:** [(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]  \n- I successfully advanced **LEFT** last turn, moving closer to the apple at (4, 0).  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Apples Still Available**  \nRemaining apples on the board are at these locations:  \n- (0, 4)  \n- (4, 0)  \n- (1, 9)  \n- (2, 7)  \n- (8, 7)  \n\nThe apple at **(4, 0)** is still the most favorable target based on proximity and risk.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Current Risk Assessment from (3, 3)**  \n\n- **Immediate Collision Risks:**  \n   - I cannot **RIGHT (to (4, 3))** as it moves into my own body.  \n   - I cannot **UP (to (3, 4))** as it is unnecessary and deviates from the apple path.  \n   - Moving **LEFT (to (2, 3))** is safe but does not progress toward the apple at (4, 0).  \n   - Moving **DOWN (to (3, 2))** is safe and progresses efficiently toward the apple but requires slightly more care near the tail.\n\n- **Global Board Risk:**  \n   - Snake #0 is still confined in the area near the top of the board. Its presence does not directly impact my immediate path to the apple.  \n   - No other imminent collision threats from the board.  \n \n---\n\n#### **4. Priority Reassessment \u2013 Targeting Apples**  \n\n1. **(4, 0):**  \n   - **Proximity:** 3 steps down from my current position.  \n   - **Risk:** No enemy snakes nearby; only a need to carefully avoid overlapping with my body.  \n   - **Plan:** Focus on eating this apple FIRST. A sequence of **DOWN -> DOWN -> RIGHT** seems most efficient.  \n\n2. **(0, 4):**  \n   - Lower priority as it is farther away and takes more moves. Pursue only after securing (4, 0).  \n\n3. **Other apples (1, 9), (2, 7), (8, 7):**  \n   - These apples are unlikely to be contested for several more turns. Safe to deprioritize for now.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Movement Options from (3, 3)**  \n\n1. **UP (to (3, 4)):**  \n   - Moves away from my immediate target and wastes precious time.  \n   - **Not a favorable move.**  \n\n2. **DOWN (to (3, 2)):**  \n   - Directly progresses toward the apple at (4, 0).  \n   - Keeps me safe and opens up more flexibility next turn to realign toward (4, 0).  \n   - **Best option for this turn.**  \n\n3. **LEFT (to (2, 3)):**  \n   - Keeps me safe but moves me farther away from (4, 0).  \n   - Inefficient for progressing toward my immediate goal.  \n   - **Not optimal.**  \n\n4. **RIGHT (to (4, 3)):**  \n   - This is an invalid move as it leads directly into my body.  \n   - **Not possible.**  \n\n---\n\n#### **6. Plan for This Turn and Strategy for the Next**  \n\n- **This Turn:** Move **DOWN** to (3, 2).  \n- **Future Turn Strategy:** After moving down, re-evaluate. Likely, the path will involve a **RIGHT** move next turn to realign toward (4, 0). Maintain awareness of my tail placement to avoid unintentionally boxing myself in near the bottom.  \n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: DOWN**"

Current Snake Status**\n- **My Head Position:** (4, 2) (after the last move RIGHT).\n- **My Body Configuration:** [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)].\n- **Growth:** Since I ate the apple at (4, 2), my body will grow by 1 segment during this next move.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Apples Still Available**\nThe remaining apples on the board are:\n1. **(0, 4)**  \n2. **(4, 0)**  \n3. **(1, 9)**  \n4. **(8, 7)**  \n\n**Next Closest Apple:**  \n- The apple at **(4, 0)** is still the closest and most easily reachable from my current head position.\n- Priority Target: **(4, 0)**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Risk Analysis**\n\n#### **Immediate Collision Risks:**\nFrom my position at **(4, 2)**:\n- **UP (to (4, 3)):** This will result in a collision with my own body. **Not possible.**\n- **DOWN (to (4, 1)):** This move is **safe** and moves me closer to the apple at (4, 0). **Favorable.**\n- **LEFT (to (3, 2)):** This leads back into my own body. **Not possible.**\n- **RIGHT (to (5, 2)):** This move is **safe**, but it moves me farther from the immediate target (4, 0). **Not favorable.**\n\n**Global Risk Assessment:**  \n- Snake #0 is far away in the upper half of the board, and there are no imminent threats from other snakes.\n- My tail is situated to the right, so moving downward opens new space for future maneuvers.\n- Moving downward is the most efficient path toward the apple at (4, 0).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Updated Plan \u2013 Targeting Apples**\n**Current Plan:**  \n- Move **DOWN (to (4, 1))**, which continues my progress directly toward the apple at (4, 0).  \n- Once at (4, 0), reassess based on the new global board state, including any newly spawned apples or emergent threats.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**  \n- After successfully eating the apple at (4, 0), I will likely shift focus toward the next nearest apple, potentially **(0, 4)** or newly spawned apples (if any).  \n- Avoid boxing myself in as my tail grows longer by leveraging open spaces and avoiding unnecessary backtracking.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Movement Analysis**\n- **UP (to (4, 3)):** Leads into my body. **Not possible.**\n- **DOWN (to (4, 1)):** Safe, efficient, and progresses toward the target apple at (4, 0). **Best option.**\n- **LEFT (to (3, 2)):** Leads into my body. **Not possible.**\n- **RIGHT (to (5, 2)):** Safe but inefficient as it deviates from my primary target (4, 0). **Not favorable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Next Move: DOWN**\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\nAfter moving **DOWN** to (4, 1), aim to reach (4, 0) in the following turn to collect the apple. Reassess once the apple is obtained, considering new spawn locations, my updated body length, and the global board state."
