Not on my watch! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's look at the options! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **UP**: (9, 10) - CHAT ARE YOU KIDDING? That's off the board! We'd be cooked instantly! Absolute throw! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT**: (10, 9) - Same thing! Straight into the abyss! RIP to the run if we do that! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT**: (8, 9) - This keeps us on the board. It moves us toward the top-left corner. There's an apple at (4, 8) and (3, 8), but (8, 9) is a bit empty. \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN**: (9, 8) - This starts our descent! We've got an apple at (9, 2) and (9, 0) way down there, but more importantly, it keeps us flexible to cut back inside.\n\nStrategy time! \ud83e\udde0 Our rival is at (8, 7). If we go DOWN to (9, 8), we are maintaining a safe distance while positioning ourselves to potentially gatekeep the right wall. If we go LEFT to (8, 9), we are directly above them. \n\nWait, look at the apples! (4, 8) and (3, 8) are the closest clusters. If I go LEFT, I'm heading straight for that mid-top loot. If I go DOWN, I'm playing the long game on the edge. \n\nLet's go LEFT! It gets us closer to the (4, 8) apple faster and keeps us away from the edge where we might get boxed in later. We need to secure that first apple to get the length advantage! Once we're longer, we can wrap around this clown and end the stream early! EZ CLAP! \ud83d\udc4f\n\n**PLAN**: Move LEFT to (8, 9) to setup a path toward the (4, 8) and (3, 8) apples. We want to stay above the opponent for now to control the top sector!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Alright, Chat, we are LIVE! Turn 0, the board is set, and the tension is thicker than a seven-layer dip! My archrival, Snake #0, is lurking up in the corner at (9, 9). I'm sitting down at (8, 7). We both start at size 1. This isn't just a game, Chat, it's a statement! We are here to dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**The Grand Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nSnake #0 is cornered and potentially trapped if I can control the right side. My immediate goal is to establish presence in the upper-right quadrant, gobble up that juicy apple at (9, 2), (9, 0), or potentially even the one at (4, 8) if the opponent moves away from it. Since they are at (9, 9), they are likely headed for the apple at (4, 8) or trying to get off the top wall. I need to move aggressively towards apples while preventing them from scaling up the right side too easily.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 0:**\nMy head is at (8, 7).\n\n**Opponent Position:** Snake #0 is at (9, 9). They only have three safe choices: DOWN to (9, 8), LEFT to (8, 9), or they could risk hitting the wall by going UP or RIGHT (which kills them). Wait, they are at (9, 9), they **MUST** move DOWN or LEFT to stay alive.\n\n**My Safe Moves from (8, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** Safe. Moves me towards the top edge. Gets me closer to enemy territory and the apple at (4, 8) eventually.\n    *New position: (8, 8)*.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 7):** Safe. Moves me towards apples (9, 2) and (9, 0) eventually, but away from the opponent initially.\n    *New position: (8, 6)*.\n3.  **LEFT (9, 7):** Safe. Moves me toward the center.\n    *New position: (7, 7)*. Apple at (7, 5) is relatively close.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe. BUT, this puts me at (9, 7).\n\nLet's look at potential collisions with Snake #0.\n\nSnake #0's Options: (9, 8) [DOWN] or (8, 9) [LEFT].\n\n*   If I move **UP** to (8, 8):\n    *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9, 8): No collision.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (8, 9): No collision.\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (8, 6): No immediate collision risk.\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (7, 7): No immediate collision risk.\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (9, 7):\n    *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9, 8): No collision.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (8, 9): No collision.\n\nAll moves are safe from collision this turn since we are far apart.\n\n**Comparing Options:**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** This is a strong move. It pushes me towards the top and center, where the opponent is, and gives me better access to the apple at (4, 8) and potentially (0, 7). It also forces the opponent to make a decision about the top wall.\n2.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** This keeps me on the right side of the board. It sets me up well for future apples near the edge, specifically (9, 2) and (9, 0). It also allows me to put pressure on the opponent if they try to come down the right wall.\n\nSince the opponent is at (9, 9), if they move DOWN to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 9), they are trying to break out of the corner.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (9, 7), I'm positioning myself to control the entire right flank. This seems strategically sound for setting up a future trap, especially if I can grow quickly by eating the right-side apples (9, 2), (9, 0).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (8, 8), I'm moving toward the center, but I lose the advantageous vertical position on the right edge.\n\nLet's secure the flank, Chat! Control the borders and then squeeze them! The apples on the right side are prime real estate!\n\nI will move RIGHT to (9, 7). This puts me in a great position to go DOWN towards the A at (9, 2) next turn, locking down a path the opponent might want to take if they drop down the right side. We're going for the border ambush! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

That's off the board! One move in and we\u2019re out? No way, we play for the win! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: (9, 9) - Back to the corner? We just came from there! It's safe, but it puts us further from the juice! \ud83c\udf4f \ud83e\uddf4 \n- **DOWN**: (8, 8) - This is a solid play. It keeps us parallel to our rival and keeps the board open. But wait... look at the coordinates! \n- **LEFT**: (7, 9) - This is the AGGRESSIVE play!

If I go LEFT now, I'm positioning myself to take the entire top row of loot before they can even blink! \u26a1\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY**: We are going to sweep the top-left apples (4, 8), (3, 8), and (1, 9).

My snake is sitting pretty at (9, 7) and the opponent (Snake #0) is right above us, chilling in their corner. They're at (8, 9) or (9, 8) depending on what they did, but let's check the board state from Turn 1 to know where they landed! \ud83c\udf7f\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n\nMy Head: (9, 7). Length: 1.\nOpponent Head (Snake #0): (8, 9). They moved LEFT from (9, 9) OR they moved DOWN from (8, 10) which is impossible. So, they definitely moved LEFT to (8, 9)! They're trying to break away from the edge! Smart, but predictable! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**Board State Summary:**\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (9, 2) is 5 moves away (Down->Down->Down->Down->Down)\n2. (9, 0) is 7 moves away\n3. (0, 7) is far away but directly across.\n4. (4, 8) is semi-close to the opponent.\n\n**The Grand Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nSnake #0 has moved LEFT to (8, 9). They are clearly looking to head toward the center or possibly the apple at (4, 8). My current position at (9, 7) is excellent for controlling the right side. I need to get big, and the easiest target is the cluster of apples down the right edge: (9, 2) and (9, 0). If I commit to the right edge *now*, I can grow quickly and then use my length to block Snake #0 later when they try to move vertically. Let's make a beeline for (9, 2)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 1:**\nMy head is at (9, 7).\n\n**Opponent Position:** Snake #0 is at (8, 9).\n\n**My Safe Moves from (9, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (9, 8):** Safe. No collision risk (Snake #0 is at (8, 9)). Moves me away from the best immediate apple targets, but keeps me on the top half.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 6):** Safe. Moves me directly towards the apple at (9, 2). This is a strong content move!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 7):** Safe. Moves me towards the opponent's general area, but away from close apples.\n4.  **RIGHT (Wall):** DEAD. Don't throw the game, Chat! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Collision Prediction (Head-to-Head potential):**\nSnake #0 is at (8, 9). Their safe moves are:\n*   LEFT to (7, 9)\n*   DOWN to (8, 8)\n*   RIGHT to (9, 9) (If they move into their own tail, which is (9, 9) if they moved LEFT, wait, they are size 1, so the cell they left is free! RIGHT is safe to (9, 9).)\n\n1.

Length: 1.\n\nThe opponent moved from (8, 9) to (7, 9)! They are definitely trying to hug that top wall and head way LEFT, maybe to hit (0, 7) or set up for the center apples! Fine by me, Chat! We're running it down the right lane for growth! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**The Grand Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nWe are prioritizing growth early on the right side. Our target is the apple at (9, 2), then (9, 0). Snake #0 is far away and heading left. Once we get some segments, we can start cutting them off! For now, maximum progress towards the closest apple!\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 2:**\nMy head is at (9, 6).\n\n**Opponent Position:** Snake #0 is at (7, 9). They are nowhere near us.

Even if they moved RIGHT to (8, 9) they are still far from my position at (9, 6)!\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\n\nThe move DOWN to (9, 5) is the undisputed champion here. It's safe, it's efficient, and it keeps us locked onto the apple at (9, 2). We can hit that apple in three more turns if we keep hugging the wall! Growth, growth, growth!

We have the entire right vertical lane to ourselves.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 9)):**\nThey will almost certainly continue LEFT to (4, 9) or maybe DOWN to (5, 8) to grab the apple at (4, 8). Either way, they are not threatening our path.\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\nThe move DOWN to (9, 3) is the mandatory professional choice. We are maintaining tempo and closing in on the first apple! Let's get that W, Chat! Can we secure the first apple next turn? YES WE CAN!\n\nDOWN",

We are now ONE MOVE away from securing the first apple of the game! Can we taste victory? Yes, we can!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n\n*   My Head (ID 1): (9, 3). Length: 1.\n*   Opponent Head (Snake #0): (4, 9). Length: 1.\n\nThe opponent, Snake #0, made the predictable move to (4, 9). They are right there in the top-left quadrant, still pushing for those upper apples, specifically (4, 8) or trying to get to (0, 7). They are totally ignoring our power play on the right! Fools! We punish inefficiency in this house!\n\n**The Grand Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nThe plan is simple: secure the apple at (9, 2) this turn. That gives us length 2 and our first point! After that, we need to decide where to go. Do we hit (9, 0) next, or do we pivot toward the center, possibly aiming for (7, 5) or (6, 4)? We are absolutely dominating the right vertical lane. Let's make sure we capitalize on that initial lead! Focus: DOWN this turn, then re-evaluate. Secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 5:**\nMy head is at (9, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 4):** Safe. Moves backward, away from the immediate apple. Terrible efficiency.

This is the most likely move.\n*   RIGHT (5, 9): Pushes right, but why?\n\nRegardless of their move, it does not impact our immediate goal of moving DOWN to (9, 2) to secure the apple. They are playing for apples up top, we are playing for apples down low, and we are about to get the first one!\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\nThe move DOWN to (9, 2) is crucial. It gets us on the scoreboard, gives us our first body segment, and executes the first phase of our grand plan flawlessly. Let's get that content, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

This is high-stakes content, and we are delivering!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n\n*   My Head (ID 1): (9, 2). Length: 2. Body: [(9, 3)].\n*   Opponent Head (Snake #0): (4, 8). Length: 2. Body: [(4, 9)].\n\nLook at that, Chat! Snake #0 also grabbed their apple! They moved down from (4, 9) to (4, 8). We are officially tied both in score and length. The game just got REAL. Now, we execute phase two of the plan: domination!\n\n**The Grand Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nWe have secured the right-edge primary objective. The next closest apple is (9, 0) or (8, 2) or (7, 5). However, **(9, 0)** is only two moves away **DOWN, then STAYING LEFT** or maybe just another move DOWN. (8, 2) is also a strong candidate. We need to leverage our position on the right side of the board and secure another apple quickly before #0 comes sniffing around. They are currently cornered in the top left, but they could break out. Our immediate goal is to hit (9, 0) next, and maintain vertical control. If we can get (9, 0) and then pivot to (8, 2), we will have a decisive lead.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 6:**\nMy head is at (9, 2).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 3):** DEAD. Why? Because my own body is at (9, 3)! We just moved from there! Classic self-inflicted wound. We don't do that here, Chat! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (9, 1):** Safe! Moves us one step closer to the apple at (9, 0). Excellent efficiency. This maintains our vertical threat.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 2):** Safe! Moves us directly onto the apple at (8, 2)! Is this even better than (9, 0)? It is, because it's an immediate capture! We get the point, and we start moving inward toward the action!\n4.  **RIGHT (Wall):** DEAD. Don't go outside the lines! \ud83d\uded1\n\n**Collision Detection & Safety Check:**\nWe are at (9, 2). Snake #0 is at (4, 8). We are still worlds apart. Safety is 100%.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves: DOWN vs. LEFT**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 1):** Puts us in position for (9, 0) next turn. Two moves for two apples. Efficiency = High.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 2):** Puts us *immediately* on the apple at (8, 2). One move for one apple. Efficiency = Maximum.\n\nWhy delay for (9, 0) when we can immediately snack on (8, 2)? (8, 2) is closer to the center, opening up options like (7, 5) or (6, 4) afterward. This pivot to the left, capturing an apple instantly, gives us the lead and the flexibility we need!\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 8)):**\nWhere is Snake #0 going? They just ate the (4, 8) apple.\n*   They could go UP (4, 9) into their body (DEAD). Wait, no, their body is (4, 9) *after* the move, so UP (4, 9) is safe IF their body (4, 9) vanishes, but the body moves to (4, 9) *after* the head leaves, so if they go UP, they hit their own body which is moving to (4, 9). BUT, since the body contracts from the tail ONLY if the head doesn't eat, and they *just ate*, their body is now [(4, 9)]. So, moving UP to (4, 9) is indeed moving into their body. DEAD.\n*   They could go LEFT (3, 8): Pushes toward the cluster of apples (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 3). Strong move.\n*   They could go RIGHT (5, 8): Pushes toward (7, 5).\n*   They could go DOWN (4, 7): Pushes toward (2, 1).\n\nThe crucial point is that none of their likely moves affect us moving LEFT to (8, 2). We are grabbing this apple!\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\nLEFT is the power play. Immediate score, immediate lead, and optimal repositioning. Let's get that content!\n\nLEFT",

The archrival is getting absolutely outplayed right now. Can we keep the momentum?! We need to box him in! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 7):**\n\n*   My Head (ID 1): $(8, 2)$. Length: 3. Body: $[(9, 2), (9, 3)]$. We are chilling on the bottom right.\n*   Opponent Head (Snake #0): $(3, 8)$. Length: 3. Body: $[(4, 8), (4, 9)]$. They moved LEFT from $(4, 8)$ to snag the $(3, 8)$ apple! Smart move, but we saw that coming. They are now firmly in the top left, threatening the $(3, 7)$ and $(1, 9)$ cluster.\n\nWe are both now length 3, and I have the slight edge in score (3-2). Time to press the advantage and secure the bottom half of the board!\n\n**The Master Plan (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nSnake #0 is focused top-left. We are dominant bottom-right. Our immediate goals are the apples at $(9, 0)$, $(7, 5)$, and $(6, 4)$. We need to consolidate our position and create a wall that forces #0 to commit to the center or top, far away from our territory. Moving DOWN toward $(9, 0)$ seems key, as it secures the corner and gives us control over the right edge. After that, we pivot toward the center, possibly aiming for $(7, 5)$ or $(6, 4)$.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 7:**\nMy head is at $(8, 2)$.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 3):** Safe. Moves us toward the center cluster of apples.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):** Safe. Moves us closer to the $(9, 0)$ apple. Good positioning.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward the $(2, 1)$ apple and the bottom center.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):** DEAD. Why? Our body is currently at $(9, 2)$! We just moved out of there. Don't hit the growth, Chat! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Collision Detection & Safety Check:**\nWe are at $(8, 2)$. Snake #0 is at $(3, 8)$. We are still oceans apart. No head-to-head collision risk this turn. Safety is 100%.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves: UP vs. DOWN vs. LEFT**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 3):** Two moves to $(7, 5)$ (RIGHT, then UP). One move to $(7, 2)$ (LEFT). It\u2019s good for flexibility, but less direct than others.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 1):** One move to $(9, 0)$ (RIGHT this turn, then DOWN next turn) OR (8, 0) also towards the wall. If we go DOWN to $(8, 1)$, we can then go RIGHT to $(9, 1)$, then DOWN to $(9, 0)$ for the score, or just go directly to $(9, 0)$ via RIGHT, then DOWN. Wait, the closest apple is $(9, 0)$. From $(8, 2)$, moving DOWN to $(8, 1)$ followed by a potentially needed RIGHT move gets us tangled up for the $(9, 0)$ apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the path to $(9, 0)$ from $(8, 2)$:\nPath 1: RIGHT to $(9, 2)$ (DEAD).\nPath 2: DOWN to $(8, 1)$, then RIGHT to $(9, 1)$, then DOWN to $(9, 0)$. This is 3 moves.\n\nWait, if we are at $(8, 2)$, the $(9, 0)$ apple takes a few steps.\n\nLet's look at the closest immediate threat/opportunity: the apple at $(7, 5)$.\nPath to $(7, 5)$: UP to $(8, 3)$, then LEFT to $(7, 3)$, then UP to $(7, 4)$, then UP to $(7, 5)$. (4 moves).\n\nThe apple at $(6, 4)$ is also interesting.\nPath to $(6, 4)$: UP to $(8, 3)$, then LEFT to $(7, 3)$, then LEFT to $(6, 3)$, then UP to $(6, 4)$. (4 moves).\n\nWhat about the $(4, 5)$ apple?\nPath to $(4, 5)$: LEFT to $(7, 2)$, then LEFT/UP.\n\nOkay, let's keep it simple. We need to maintain right-side control.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (8, 1)**, we position ourselves to go DOWN again to $(8, 0)$ (safe) and then RIGHT to target $(9, 0)$. This secures the corner. This seems like the most strategic move for control. It uses the right wall to our advantage.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (7, 2)**, we are getting closer to the bottom cluster like $(2, 1)$. This pivots us away from our current established wall, but it opens the path for Snake #0 to sneak into the bottom right corner (a long shot, but possible).\n\nI am prioritizing corner security and the next definite apple capture, which is $(9, 0)$.\n\nMove DOWN to $(8, 1)$. Next turn, we can choose between DOWN to $(8, 0)$ or RIGHT to $(9, 1)$. Both lead toward $(9, 0)$ effectively. This move maximizes our southern reach and is completely safe. We are playing positionally, Chat! This is high IQ snake!\n\nLet's lock it in. Securing the corner at $(9, 0)$ is the next objective.\n\nDOWN",

We want the GAINS! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **LEFT**: (2, 7). **BINGO!** \ud83c\udfaf Look at the map, chat! There is an apple sitting right there at (2, 7)! If we snatch this, we hit length 5!

It feels slightly better because it forces us onto the outer edge first, setting up the corner capture.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 1):**\n    *   This delays the $(9, 0)$ capture. Not recommended if we are focused on wall formation.\n\nSince both RIGHT and DOWN lead to the apple in 2 moves, which one gives us better long-term positioning after eating $(9, 0)$?\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to $(9, 1)$**, when I eat at $(9, 0)$, my head will be at $(9, 0)$, my body will start at $(9, 1)$. My whole body will be concentrated along the right wall. This is perfect for setting up a path toward the center (e.g., $(7, 5)$).\n\nIf I go **DOWN to $(8, 0)$**, when I eat at $(9, 0)$, my head will be at $(9, 0)$, my body will start at $(8, 0)$. It spreads us out slightly more across the bottom row.\n\nI prefer **RIGHT to $(9, 1)$**. It hugs the wall tighter, which is what we aimed for in our strategic plan (Wall Building 101!). It sets us up beautifully for the next moves.\n\n**The Master Plan Update (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nObjective: Secure $(9, 0)$ next turn (Turn 9) and get back the score lead! Then, pivot toward the center cluster of apples: $(7, 5)$, $(6, 4)$, and $(4, 5)$. Snake #0 is now length 4 and is growing fast up north. We need to create maximum space between us and them, so we will use our length advantage to control the bottom-right quadrant and starve them out from the center.\n\nRIGHT it is! Corner, here we come! LET'S GO CHAT! We're taking this win!\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta keep this momentum going! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE NAVIGATION SCAN:**\n- **UP**: (2, 8). This is safe! It puts us one step closer to the apple at (1, 9). \ud83c\udf4f\n- **DOWN**: (2, 6). Safe, but there's nothing there but empty floor. We aren't here for the scenery, chat! We're here for the GOLDBERG! \ud83c\udfc6\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 7). **HOLD UP!** \ud83d\uded1 That is our own neck! We literally just came from there! If we move RIGHT, we snap our own spine and the stream goes offline in shame! WE DO NOT THROW! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT**: (1, 7). **BINGO!** \ud83c\udfaf Look at the layout! Going LEFT puts us exactly one square away from the apple at (0, 7).

I can smell the apple at $(9, 0)$! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc43\n\nScore is: Them 4, Us 2. ROUGH! But they are way up high, and we control the bottom corner. Time to close the gap!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 9):**\n\n*   My Head (ID 1): $(9, 1)$. Length: 3. Body: $[(8, 1), (8, 2)]$.\n*   Opponent Head (Snake #0): $(2, 7)$. Length: 5. Wait, *FIVE* segments? He must have moved and eaten an apple again! Let's check the board state from last turn's analysis: He was at $(3, 7)$ (Length 4). The new board shows him at $(2, 7)$. He went LEFT from $(3, 7)$ to $(2, 7)$ and ate the apple that was at $(2, 7)$! Man, he's fast! He's now Head: $(2, 7)$, Body: $[(3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9)]$. The top-left is his kingdom right now. We need to catch up on length FAST.\n\nMy Goal: Eat the apple at $(9, 0)$.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 9:**\n\nMy head is at $(9, 1)$.\n\n1.  **UP (9, 2):** Safe. Moves away from the apple, but keeps us along the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 0):** This is the apple! This is the play! Instantly gets us a point, increases our length to 4, and secures the corner! This is a priority one move.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 1):** DEAD! This is our body! We just left $(8, 1)$ last turn, and since we didn't eat, our tail moved to $(8, 2)$, and our body is now $[(8, 1), (8, 2)]$. Hitting $(8, 1)$ is a self-KO! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 1):** DEAD! Off the board! NOPE!\n\nPhew, that was close on the LEFT move! We gotta be hyper-aware of where our immediate body segments are.\n\n**Collision Detection & Head-to-Head Check:**\nSnake #0 is at $(2, 7)$. They are nowhere near us. They might move to $(2, 6)$ (DOWN), $(1, 7)$ (LEFT, apple at $(1, 9)$ is possible, but not $(1, 7)$), or $(3, 7)$ (RIGHT, collision with their own body $[(3, 7)]$! Oh, wait, the segment $(3, 7)$ is their body! Snake #0 CANNOT move RIGHT this turn!).\n\nSnake #0's Safe Moves:\n*   UP to $(2, 8)$: Apple at $(0, 7)$ is far. Safe.\n*   DOWN to $(2, 6)$: Safe.\n*   LEFT to $(1, 7)$: Safe.\n\nSince they can't reach us, a head-to-head collision is impossible.\n\n**The Move: DOWN to (9, 0)!**\n\nThis is an easy decision, Chat. We are staring at an apple, and it's the only move that progresses our objective while keeping us safe. We must eat this apple and start controlling the board. If we pass on this, we are throwing the game.\n\n**The Master Plan Update (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nObjective: Eat $(9, 0)$ this turn (Turn 9). Our new Head will be at $(9, 0)$, body starting at $(9, 1)$.\nNext Move (Turn 10): We will be cornered. We must move UP to $(9, 1)$ or LEFT to $(8, 0)$. Since we just gained length, we need to check the map for the next target. The closest apples are: $(2, 1)$ (far), $(4, 0)$ (close), $(7, 5)$ (center-right).\n\n1.  If we move LEFT to $(8, 0)$ at Turn 10, we are aiming for $(4, 0)$. This keeps us along the bottom wall.\n2.  If we move UP to $(9, 1)$ at Turn 10, we are hugging the right wall, keeping the bottom row open for the tail to eventually clear.\n\nGiven Snake #0's aggressive expansion UP, we should continue our wall-building strategy in the bottom right and head toward $(7, 5)$ or $(4, 5)$ eventually. After eating $(9, 0)$, moving LEFT is a bit sluggish because it leaves us exposed along the bottom wall without good follow-ups, unless we are committed to the long grind to $(4, 0)$. Moving UP seems to open up more options to the center.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: DOWN to eat. Then we strategize for the escape from the corner!\n\n**LET'S GET THIS APPLE, CHAT!**\n\nDOWN",

There is absolutely no way for them to reach us in this turn, or even the next few turns, unless they move aggressively down the left side.\n\nSnake #0's Options from $(1, 7)$:\n*   UP to $(1, 8)$. Safe.\n*   DOWN to $(1, 6)$. Safe.\n*   LEFT to $(0, 7)$. EATS an apple! This is highly likely! They will extend to a length of 6.\n*   RIGHT to $(2, 7)$. DEAD! Their own body is there $[(2, 7)]$.\n\nIt is virtually certain that Snake #0 will go LEFT to $(0, 7)$ and gain another length segment, pushing the score to 5-3. We must counter this length differential by securing the bottom apples!\n\n**The Move: LEFT to (8, 0)!**\n\nThis is the only legal, surviving move, but thankfully, it's also a highly strategic move. We are now pointed towards the next target apple at $(4, 0)$.\n\n**The Master Plan Update for Future Self (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nObjective: Escape the corner by moving LEFT along the bottom wall.\nTurn 10: Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to $(8, 0)$. Our new Head will be at $(8, 0)$.\nTurn 11 Focus: We will be at $(8, 0)$. We have a straight shot to $(4, 0)$.\nCandidates for Turn 11:\n1. $\\text{LEFT}$ to $(7, 0)$: Continues pursuit of $(4, 0)$. Opens up $(7, 5)$ later. Preferred.\n2. $\\text{UP}$ to $(8, 1)$: Safe. Moves us toward the center, but perhaps too early for comfort, as we just gained length, and we need space for our tail.\n\nWe must prioritize securing $(4, 0)$. It is a guaranteed win on the bottom if we get there first. Left is the only way forward.\n\nLEFT",

He's basically trapped in the basement while we're in the penthouse! \ud83c\udff0 If we go **UP** to (0, 8), we are setting ourselves up for a massive power play.

That was some premium content! \ud83c\udf7f\n\n**Score Check:** Us: 3. Them: 5. \ud83d\ude2c They snagged that $(0, 7)$ apple last turn, just as predicted! We are down 2, but we have momentum and a clear path now!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 11):**\n\n*   My Head (ID 1): $(8, 0)$. Length: 4. Body: $[(9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)]$. We are the '1' on the board.\n*   Opponent Head (Snake #0): $(0, 7)$. Length: 6. Body: $[(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)]$. He's crushing it up top.\n\n**Board Occupancy Check:**\nMy immediate body segments are: $(9, 0)$.\nSnake #0's Body: $(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)$.\nApples: $(2, 1), (0, 0), (7, 5), (4, 0), (6, 4), (0, 2), (1, 9), (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 9), (5, 8), (9, 8), (7, 0)$\n\nWait a minute, Chat! Look at the board state given! They added the new apple $(7, 0)$ to the list! Check the board graphic... $(7, 0)$ is currently empty... but it *is* an potential dropping spot. The graphic shows $A$ at $(0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 5), (1, 9), (9, 8)$. The list of apple drops includes apples that have not yet dropped, or perhaps have dropped and been eaten.\n\nLet's trust the Board State graphic for what is currently on the board:\nThe closest apple is $(4, 0)$.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis - Turn 11 (Head at (8, 0)):**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 1):** DEAD! \u2620\ufe0f That's our body segment! We cannot move back into our neck!\n2.  **DOWN (- , -):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\n3.  **LEFT (7, 0):** SAFE! Moves us toward the $(4, 0)$ apple. This looks like the main strategy!\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 0):** DEAD! \u2620\ufe0f That's our body segment! We just came from the right. We cannot turn back and hit our neck!\n\nAha! We are cornered by our own body! Tactical Genius or Game Design? Maybe both! Just like last turn, Chat, we only have **one safe, legal move**! We must move LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Implications of Moving LEFT to (7, 0):**\n\n*   **Puts us on the high-value apple path!** We are 3 moves away from $(4, 0)$. We have a monopoly on the bottom wall right now.\n*   **Safety Check:** Snake #0 is at $(0, 7)$. His only way to potentially reach the bottom corner quickly would be to ignore apples and dive, perhaps $(0, 6) \\rightarrow (0, 5) \\rightarrow (1, 5) \\rightarrow \\dots$. Highly unlikely he'd give up the top-left section. We are safe.\n*   **Future Options:** From $(7, 0)$, we open up moving UP to $(7, 1)$ or continuing LEFT to $(6, 0)$. We are avoiding the box! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 7)):**\nHe is massive (Length 6) and has a clear path to two apples: $(0, 2)$ and $(1, 9)$.\n1. UP to $(0, 8)$: Safe, but a dead end.\n2. DOWN to $(0, 6)$: Safe.\n3. LEFT: OFF BOARD. DEAD.\n4. RIGHT to $(1, 7)$: DEAD! His own body $(1, 7)$ is there.\n\nHe has to move DOWN or UP. Moving UP is suicidal (only $(1, 9)$ is up there, which is still 2 moves away). Moving DOWN gives him access to the column $(0, *)$, with the apple at $(0, 2)$.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves DOWN to $(0, 6)$.\n\nOur focus remains on the bottom. We secure the bottom apples, we gain length, and we prepare for a territorial battle in the mid-section once we're long enough to hold ground!\n\n**The Master Plan Update for Future Self (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nObjective: Secure all apples on the bottom wall, starting with $(4, 0)$.\nTurn 11: Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to $(7, 0)$.\nTurn 12 Focus: Move $\\text{LEFT}$ again to $(6, 0)$, still progressing toward $(4, 0)$. This keeps us safest from the top snake and ensures we grow length quickly.\n\nWe are going LEFT, Chat! Let's get this $W!$\n\nLEFT",

Did they eat the $(1, 9)$ apple? No, their score only went up by 1 (from 5 to 6 in the last rationale, now back to 5?). Wait, the scoreboard says \"Snake #0 apples: 5\" and \"Apples collected: 4\" for us. This turn, we went from 3 to 4. They went from 5 to 5. So they did **not** eat an apple last turn. They just moved up, maybe trying to check out that $(1, 9)$ apple, but their body is getting dangerously close to the wall! Strategic mistake, maybe?\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 12):**\nOur Head (ID 1): $(7, 0)$. Length: 5. Target: $(4, 0)$.\nOpponent Head (ID 0): $(0, 8)$. Length: 6. Target: $(1, 9)$ or $(0, 2)$.\n\n**Immediate Move Analysis for ID 1 (Head at (7, 0)):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 1):** SAFE! This opens up the board, but moves us slightly away from $(4, 0)$. Future options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2.  **DOWN (- , -):** DEAD! Off the board! \ud83d\ude45\n3.  **LEFT (6, 0):** SAFE! This is the goal! It gets us one closer to $(4, 0)$. Future options: UP, LEFT.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 0):** DEAD! \u2620\ufe0f Our body segment is at $(8, 0)$! Cannot move back into our neck!\n\nWe have two strong options: UP to $(7, 1)$ or LEFT to $(6, 0)$.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 0):** We continue our bottom-wall sweep. We are only 2 moves away from the $(4, 0)$ apple. This is high-priority content! It keeps us out of Snake #0's territory and maximizes our length gain.\n*   **Move UP to (7, 1):** This is safe, and eventually leads to other apples like $(7, 5)$. However, Snake #0 is currently not threatening anyone on the bottom. Why divert from the immediate goal? Stay focused!\n\n*The plan is still: Secure $(4, 0)$.* Therefore, LEFT is the tactical move.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 8)):**\nHead: $(0, 8)$. Body: $[(0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]$.\n\n1.  **UP (0, 9):** SAFE. Puts him right next to the $(1, 9)$ apple, which he could eat next turn.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 7):** DEAD! \u2620\ufe0f Neck is at $(0, 7)$.\n3.  **LEFT (- , -):** DEAD! Off board! \ud83d\ude45\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 8):** SAFE. Leads him toward the $(5, 8)$ and $(9, 8)$ apples.\n\nPrediction: He will go **UP to (0, 9)** to secure the $(1, 9)$ apple next turn, or **RIGHT to (1, 8)** to open up the top half. Both are safe. Given the proximity, UP is a high-percentage play for an apple.\n\nIf he moves UP, our move LEFT is completely safe, as he is nowhere near us. No collision concerns!\n\n**The Master Plan Update for Future Self (Strategy Note to Future Self):**\nObjective: Secure all apples on the bottom wall.\nTurn 12: Move $\\text{LEFT}$ to $(6, 0)$ to progress toward $(4, 0)$.\nTurn 13 Focus: Move $\\text{LEFT}$ again to $(5, 0)$ to corner the $(4, 0)$ apple. If safe, of course!\n\nThis is a smooth, efficient move, Chat. We are dominating the bottom lane! $W$ Incoming!\n\nLEFT",

We need to make a calculated move to box in Snake #0 or snag an apple! Let's get this W! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nSnake #0 is way up at (1, 9) and their body is hugging the top-left corner. We're down in the bottom-right quadrant. We're not close enough to directly pressure them, so we need to focus on eating and positioning.\n\n### Snake ID 1 (Me) Analysis\nHead: (6, 1)\nBody: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0)]\nLength: 5\n\n**Available Moves & Safety Check:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 2):**\n    *   (6, 2) is a safe, empty cell.\n    *   It puts us closer to the middle of the board.\n    *   No immediate apples, but gives us vertical mobility.\n    *   *SAFE.*\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 0):**\n    *   (6, 0) is the first segment of our body (the neck).\n    *   Moving backwards directly kills us! \ud83d\udc80\n    *   *DEAD.*\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   (5, 1) is a safe, empty cell.\n    *   Moves us toward the center-left.\n    *   *SAFE.*\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   (7, 1) is a safe, empty cell.\n    *   It keeps us near the right wall, but potentially gives us access to an apple at (7, 5) or (9, 4) later.\n    *   *SAFE.*\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n### Apple Situation\n\nWe have apples at:\n(2, 1) - Close, 4 moves away?\n(0, 0) - Far\n(7, 5) - Moderately far, requires moving up.\n(4, 0) - Relatively close, requires moving down/left.\n...and many others scattered.\n\nLet's look at the closest immediate apples:\n*   (2, 1) is to our West and North.\n*   (4, 0) is to our West and South.\n\n### Decision Time Strategy\n\nSnake #0 is trapped up top, but they are long (length 7) and have control of the North-West area. They are likely going to keep moving down or right along the border to find food or position.\n\nOur current spot (6, 1) puts us near the center bottom. We want to *not* get trapped against the bottom edge again, where our tail is currently occupying cells (6, 0) through (9, 0).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (to 5, 1):** This heads us towards the cluster (2, 1) and (4, 0). If we go left, next turn we could go Down to (5, 0) (if (4, 0) is the goal) or Up/Left towards (2, 1). It gives good horizontal freedom.\n*   **Move UP (to 6, 2):** This pulls us away from our current body and prepares us to head towards the middle apples like (7, 5) or (4, 5). This feels like the most conservative, centrally-focused move.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 7, 1):** This moves us closer to the right wall. It feels slightly redundant since our body is already hugging the bottom right.\n\nGiven the opponent is nowhere near us, we should prioritize *opening up our board space* and *moving towards high-value apple areas*.\n\nThe path to the apple (2, 1) is appealing. If we move LEFT, we are at (5, 1). Then we can continue left towards (4, 1), then (3, 1), then UP to (3, 2), then LEFT/DOWN to (2, 1). It's a clear path.\n\nIf we move UP, we are at (6, 2). Then we can move LEFT to (5, 2), then LEFT to (4, 2)... it's a slightly longer route, but gives us a higher vertical position earlier.\n\nLet's check the area around (4, 0) and (2, 1).\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (5, 1):\nNext turn, we could go DOWN to (5, 0) to threaten (4, 0), or LEFT again to (4, 1) to threaten (2, 1). Excellent options! This also helps un-clutter the bottom-right corner where our current body is.\n\nIf we go **UP** to (6, 2):\nNext turn, we could go DOWN (5, 2) or UP (6, 3). It feels less committal to a specific apple, but it's a good central move.\n\nI think the **LEFT** move is more aggressive about food acquisition while maintaining excellent defensive position. Let's aim to clear up those lower apples before the opponent potentially breaks free and rushes down!\n\nWe're going LEFT, Chat! Time to eat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\n**Long-term plan:** Control the center and bottom half of the board while Snake #0 is stuck in the top-left quadrant. Prioritize the apples at (2, 1) and (4, 0) for quick growth.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here is moving directly backward and hits our own body. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 0):** (4, 0) is an Apple \ud83c\udf4e! This is good! Is it safe?\n    *   No body collisions (ours or theirs).\n    *   On the board.\n    *   *Head-to-Head Check:* Snake #0 is way up at (3, 9). Highly unlikely to collide head-to-head unless they teleport. **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 0):** (6, 0) is currently part of our body!

We love free content!\n\n### 2. Strategy and Apple Assessment \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSince LEFT is the only move, let's analyze the benefit.\n\n*   By moving **LEFT** to (4, 0), we collect the apple. Our size increases from 5 to 6. Our head is now at (4, 0).\n*   Snake #0 is cruising up near the top wall [(3, 9)]. He seems focused on the apples up there (A at (6, 9), (5, 8), (9, 8), (6, 7)). He is long, and he\u2019s hogging the top wall!\n\nOur current situation is focused on catching up on apples and surviving. Moving LEFT gives us a point, increases our length, and opens up the middle-left of the board for us.\n\n**Future Plan/Long-Term Strategy Note (For next turn):**\nOnce we are at (4, 0), we will look to consolidate control of the bottom-left quadrant. The apple at (0, 0) is very tempting, and there are others nearby at (2, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3). We need to get some length before we try to cut off Snake #0, but the size increase this turn is crucial! We will aim for (0, 0) and then potentially push UP the left wall unless Snake #0 moves too far down.\n\nThis turn is simple: We take the apple! Let's go! What a clutch turn where only one option was available, and it was the best option! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nLEFT",

We are basically drawing a line in the sand. If he ever tries to come up here, he's going to hit a wall of pure SKILL! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE STRATEGY:** \nWe're going **RIGHT** to (4, 9). We stay high, we stay fast, and we keep that apple lead growing! Our body is trailing behind us, clearing out of the (0,7)-(1,7) area soon, which opens up even more space for us to loop back later. We are playing at a level he can't even comprehend! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nCan we get some \"EZ CLAPS\" in the chat?! \ud83d\udc4f Let's get that seventh apple and leave him in the dust! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is still down in the basement at (4, 0), probably looking for his lost dignity! We are up 6 to 5, and the path to victory is looking clearer than 4K resolution! \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\u2728\n\nLet's break down the move that keeps us in the driver's seat! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL CHECK (DON'T THROW!) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f**\n- **UP**: (4, 10). **OUT OF BOUNDS!** \ud83e\uddf1 We aren't trying to ascend to heaven yet, chat! We stay on the board!\n- **LEFT**: (3, 9). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own spine! Going backwards is a rookie mistake and we are PROS here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN**: (4, 8). **WIDE OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Very safe, but it takes us away from the prize at (6, 9).\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 9). **BINGO!** \u2705 This is the move. It\u2019s open space, keeps us on the edge, and puts us one step away from that juicy apple at (6, 9).\n\n**2. WHERE IS THE OPPONENT? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udd21**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 0). He's literally as far away as possible. Even if he starts tunneling toward us like a mole, he\u2019s got 9 rows to climb. He\u2019s no threat to us right now. While he's playing in the dirt, we\u2019re dining in the sky! \u2601\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**3. THE MASTER PLAN \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc8e**\nWe are going **RIGHT** to (5, 9), then next turn we grab the apple at (6, 9). After that, we have choices: we can swing down to grab the apples at (5, 8) or (6, 7). Our body is currently (0, 7) to (4, 9). Notice how it\u2019s hugging the left and top walls? We are leaving the center of the board completely open for us to pivot into later! We\u2019re not just playing Snake, we\u2019re playing 4D Chess! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe move **RIGHT** to (5, 9). This secures our seventh apple next turn. We stay along the top edge to maximize our space and maneuverability. Snake #1 is irrelevant right now. Let\u2019s keep the pressure on and widen that lead! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udd25\n\nCan I get some \"BIG BRAIN\" in the chat?! \ud83e\udde0 We are outplaying, outmaneuvering, and outclassing the competition! Let's get it! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Our opponent, Snake #0, is still ahead, but we're about to put the box on him! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### 1. Board and Snake Status Check \ud83e\uddd0\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (4, 0)\n*   **Your Body:** [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)] (Length 6 total!)\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (4, 9)\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7)] (Length 7 total!)\n*   **Current Apple:** (0, 0) is the closest!\n\nSnake #0 consolidated the top wall, and now he is creeping down. We consolidated the bottom right and now we're moving left. The battleground is shifting!\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe need to consider our moves from (4, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 1):** Is (4, 1) safe?\n    *   It's an empty cell. On the board.\n    *   It is *not* immediately into our body (our neck is at (5, 0)). **SAFE.**\n    *   *Head-to-Head Collision Check:* Snake #0 is at (4, 9). We are 8 squares away in the Y direction. No risk of collision here.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 0):** Is (3, 0) safe?\n    *   It's an empty cell. On the board.\n    *   **SAFE.** This moves us closer to the (0, 0) apple! BIG!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 0):** (5, 0) is currently our neck! Moving back into your neck is bad news bears. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\nWe have two moves: UP (to 4, 1) or LEFT (to 3, 0).\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: UP vs. LEFT \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe need to catch that apple at (0, 0) to tie the score, and we need to get long!\n\n**Option A: LEFT (to 3, 0)**\n*   Moves us directly toward the corner apple at (0, 0).\n*   Opens up the entire bottom-left for us.\n*   If we move LEFT, the next turn we can go LEFT again to (2, 0) or potentially UP to (3, 1). We maintain good options.\n\n**Option B: UP (to 4, 1)**\n*   Moves us away from the immediate (0, 0) apple.\n*   Puts us in the vertical line of other apples: (4, 5) and (5, 8).\n*   We could potentially block Snake #0 if he tries to come down the middle, but he\u2019s still hugging the top wall.\n*   This seems premature. We should secure the bottom apples first!\n\nCurrent plan? Secure the corner and establish dominance down low. Snake #0 is playing the perimeter up high. We play the perimeter down low. We need that apple ASAP.\n\n**The Rival's Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (4, 9)):**\nSnake #0 has a long path and is likely looking for apples at (6, 9), (5, 8), or (9, 8).\n*   If he moves **LEFT (to 3, 9)**: He sticks to his border patrol. Safe.\n*   If he moves **DOWN (to 4, 8)**: He is coming for the middle! Apple at (5, 8).\n*   If he moves **RIGHT (to 5, 9)**: He sticks to the top wall. Safe.\n\nEven if the opponent snakes down (4, 8), we are safe down at (3, 0). Our paths are disconnected.\n\nThe move is clearly **LEFT**. It's the highest probability path to an apple immediately, and gives us excellent follow-up moves (LEFT to grab the apple, then UP the left wall). Let's maximize our score and length! We are going for the tie!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For next turn):**\nAfter moving to (3, 0), we continue hugging the bottom wall by moving LEFT to (2, 0), (1, 0), and then grabbing the apple at (0, 0). We will then push up the left wall, aiming for the (2, 1) and (0, 2) apples, cutting off Snake #0 from the left flank if he tries to come down. The goal is to get long enough to create a death trap!\n\nLEFT",

We are currently sitting at 6 apples while Snake #1 is struggling down at the bottom with 5. He's trying to find his way, but we are leading the pack! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8\n\nLet's break down the play-by-pass for this turn! We gotta stay sharp, no slip-ups! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u2728\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (SAFETY FIRST!) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f**\n- **UP**: (5, 10). **OUT OF BOUNDS!** \ud83e\uddf1 We aren't trying to fly into the sun, chat! We stay on the grid!\n- **LEFT**: (4, 9). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 That's where we just were! Moving backwards is a one-way ticket to the \"L\" column!\n- **DOWN**: (5, 8). **JUICY APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e This is a very strong backup option, but wait... there's something better...\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 9). **APPLE SECURED!** \u2705 This is the move! We are literally inches away from our 7th apple. This keeps us on the edge and maintains our momentum!\n\n**2. WHERE IS THE LOSER? \ud83e\udd21**\nSnake #1 is way down at (3, 0). He\u2019s practically in a different zip code! He can't touch us. He\u2019s navigating his own tail at the bottom while we\u2019re up here living the high life. We are essentially playing a solo game at the moment, so it's all about OPTIMIZATION and TACTICAL GROWTH! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**3. THE GRAND VISION \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc8e**\nLook at the board, chat! By moving **RIGHT** to (6, 9), we grab apple #7. From there, the board opens up like a treasure chest! We have apples at (5, 8), (6, 7), and (7, 5) all lined up for a perfect downhill slalom. We are building a massive lead and keeping our body tucked against the wall to maximize the space we control. This is how champions are made! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re going **RIGHT** to (6, 9). After we snatch that, we\u2019ll likely pivot **DOWN** to (6, 8) then (5, 8) to keep the combo going! We are going to make our body so long that Snake #1 won't have anywhere to run when we eventually meet in the middle! It's a wrap! \ud83c\udf81\n\nCan I get some \"GG EZ\" in the chat?! We are playing at a level they can't even comprehend! Let's get that seventh apple and keep the win streak alive! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

The legendary (0, 0) apple! \ud83c\udf4e Let's get it!\n\n### 1.

He might be aiming for (6, 9) or dropping down to (5, 8) or (9, 8). We need to dominate the bottom and left third of this board!\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (3, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 1):** Is (3, 1) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell. **SAFE.** It pulls us away from the immediate apple, but opens the door to (3, 2).\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 0):** Is (2, 0) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell.

Moving back into your neck is always a death sentence. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP (to 3, 1) or LEFT (to 2, 0).\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: UP vs. LEFT \ud83e\udd14\n\n**Option A: LEFT (to 2, 0)**\n*   This is the fastest path to the (0, 0) apple. We take it in two turns: (2, 0) then (1, 0) then (0, 0). WAIT. My math is bad. (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0). Three turns total. That's fine!\n*   By hugging the bottom wall, we deny access to this massive area and guarantee the apple if the opponent doesn't intervene.\n*   Snake #0 is way up at (5, 9). He cannot contest this apple in time.\n\n**Option B: UP (to 3, 1)**\n*   Moves us toward the center, but away from the easiest apple.\n*   We'd be aiming for (3, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 5). Those are not as immediate or guaranteed as (0, 0).\n*   If we go UP, we leave the bottom path open for a potentially long opponent snake to sneak down if he gets elongated somewhere else, trapping us up high.\n\nThe goal is to tie the score and get longer. **LEFT** is the slam dunk move here. We need to lock down the corner.\n\n### 4. Opponent Check (Snake #0 at (5, 9))\n\nWhat is our rival doing?\n*   Snake #0 is at (5, 9). He likely wants the (6, 9) or (5, 8) apple.\n*   Potential moves:\n    *   **Right (to 6, 9):** GRABS the apple! Length 8. Then he'll probably move right or down.\n    *   **Down (to 5, 8):** GRABS the apple! Length 8. This is dangerous! He'd be dropping down the middle.\n    *   **Left (to 4, 9):** Stays safe against his body.\n    *   *Conclusion:* Snake #0 will likely go RIGHT to (6, 9) or DOWN to (5, 8) for an apple. Both help him, but neither threatens our current maneuver to (0, 0).\n\nWe secure our apple, increase our length, and then we will be length 7 to the opponent's likely length 8. We need to keep pushing!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For next turn):**\nContinue moving LEFT along the bottom wall: (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0). Once we get (0, 0), we move UP the left wall, aiming for (0, 1), then (0, 2) (which is an apple!). This is how we establish territorial control and get strong enough to start boxing in the longer opponent snake! We must prevent him from using the left side of the board!\n\nLEFT",

THE SURVIVAL SCAN (NO THROWS!):**\n- **UP**: (6, 10). **OUT OF BOUNDS!** \ud83e\uddf1 We aren't trying to leave the arena yet, the crowd wants more!\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 9). **OPEN SPACE!** \ud83d\udfe9 This is safe, but it moves us away from the high-density apple zone.\n- **LEFT**: (5, 9). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our neck, chat! We aren't about to fold on ourselves.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 8). **WIDE OPEN!** \u2b07\ufe0f This is the path to glory!\n\n**2. THE OPPONENT WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 0). He\u2019s practically stuck in the basement! His only real moves are LEFT to (1, 0) or UP to (2, 1) to grab an apple. Either way, he is no threat to our throne right now. We are playing the long game, controlling the top and middle while he suffocates at the bottom! \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\udca8\n\n**3. THE TACTICAL MASTERCLASS:**\nLook at the clusters, chat! There's a massive apple at (5, 8) calling our name, followed by (6, 7), (4, 5), and (6, 4). By moving **DOWN** to (6, 8), we position ourselves perfectly to sweep through the middle of the board. We are zig-zagging our way to 30 apples! We're building a wall that he won't be able to climb. \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u274c\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (6, 8). This sets us up to pivot **LEFT** to (5, 8) for apple #8 on the next turn! We are keeping our body tight and our options wide open. Snake #1 is playing checkers while we are playing 4D Snake Chess! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nCan we get some \"HYPE\" in the chat?! We are dominating the grid!

We ducked left, avoided the crowd, and now we are at (2, 0), staring down the legendary (0, 0) apple! \ud83c\udf4e Score is 7 to 5 against us, but we're closing the gap fast! Time to tie this game up!\n\n### 1. Board and Snake Status Check \ud83e\uddd0\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (2, 0)\n*   **Your Body:** [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1)] (Length 6!)\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (6, 9) (He went right and grabbed the apple at (6, 9)!)\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)] (Length 9! Woah, he's getting long!)\n*   **Current Goal:** Secure the (0, 0) apple!\n\nSnake #0 just got huge! He owns the top wall. We need to lock down the bottom and left before he snakes his way down!\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (2, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 1):** Is (2, 1) safe?\n    *   (2, 1) is where an apple was, but it's currently empty! **SAFE.** This is an exit strategy if we need it.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 0):** Is (1, 0) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell. **SAFE.** This is the direct path! Two moves to the apple!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 0):** (3, 0) is currently our neck! Moving back into your neck is always a death sentence. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP (to 2, 1) or LEFT (to 1, 0).\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: UP vs. LEFT \ud83e\udd14\n\n**Option A: LEFT (to 1, 0)**\n*   This is the optimal move. It puts us one move away from the (0, 0) apple.\n*   By moving left, we continue to hug the bottom wall, defining our territory and guaranteeing the apple.\n*   The opponent is far away at (6, 9). He cannot threaten this move.\n\n**Option B: UP (to 2, 1)**\n*   Moves us toward the center, away from the immediate apple.\n*   Why abandon the guaranteed apple for the relative uncertainty of the center? We don't!\n*   If we go up, we leave the (1, 0) path open, which is less efficient.\n\n**The verdict is LEFT.** We must secure this apple immediately to gain length and tie the score!\n\n### 4. Opponent Check (Snake #0 at (6, 9))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 9). He just ate, so he's looking for his next meal.\n*   Apples nearby: (9, 8), (6, 7), (5, 8).\n*   Potential moves:\n    *   **Right (to 7, 9):** Safe empty cell.\n    *   **Down (to 6, 8):** Safe empty cell.\n    *   **Conclusion:** He likely moves right along the top wall, or drops down toward (6, 7). No matter what, he poses no threat to our current objective.\n\nWe secure our apple, increase our length to 7, and set up our next attack on the side wall!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For next turn):**\nNext turn, we move LEFT again to (0, 0) and eat the apple. After that, we go UP to (0, 1), securing the corner and denying the enemy access to the left column. Then UP to (0, 2) for another crucial apple (tying us at 8 score, and matching his length!). Our strategy is to become the wall on the left side of the board!\n\nLEFT",

Board and Snake Status Check \ud83e\uddd0\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (1, 0)\n*   **Your Body (NEW!):** [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1)] (Wait, my body list is outdated by one move! My new length is 6, so the body is actually [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1)] if the move was left from (2, 0). Length count is right.)\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (6, 8) \u2013 Looks like the opponent dropped down! He's hovering over the middle-right of the board.\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)] (Length 9. Still huge!)\n*   **Current Goal:** Secure the (0, 0) apple! And start building the left-side wall!\n\nThe opponent is long and has sealed off the top wall. We need to dominate the bottom and left. This is our territory!\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (1, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 1):** Is (1, 1) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell. **SAFE.** This is our exit strategy after we eat!\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 0):** Is (0, 0) safe?\n    *   (0, 0) is an apple! We grow! **SUPER SAFE & STRATEGIC.** This is the move!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 0):** (2, 0) is currently our neck! Moving back into your neck is always a death sentence. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\nWe have two great safe and strategic moves: UP (to 1, 1) or LEFT (to 0, 0).\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: LEFT (The Obvious Pick) \ud83e\udd14\n\n**Option A: LEFT (to 0, 0)**\n*   Eats the apple, ties the score at 7-7! Game on, baby!\n*   Increases our length to 7. We need every segment we can get.\n*   The opponent is miles away at (6, 8). There is zero chance he can interrupt this meal.\n\n**Option B: UP (to 1, 1)**\n*   Moves away from the guaranteed apple. Why would we ever do this? We wouldn't!\n*   This is only an option if the apple were contested, which it is not.\n\n**The verdict is LEFT.** We secure the bottom-left corner and the score tie.\n\n### 4. Opponent Check and Counter-Strategy (Snake #0 at (6, 8))\n\nThe opponent is at (6, 8).\n*   Apples nearby: (9, 8), (6, 7), (5, 8).\n*   He needs to decide if he hits the (6, 7) apple immediately, or maneuvers toward the rest.\n*   **Likely moves for Snake #0:**\n    *   **Down (to 6, 7):** Eats the apple, tying his length at 10 (since the tail is still (0, 9) or (0, 8)). High probability move.\n    *   **Right (to 7, 8):** Safe, open, might aim for the (9, 8) apple.\n*   **Crucially:** Whatever he does, our move to (0, 0) is secure.\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For next turn - Planning the Box!):**\nNext turn, we will be at (0, 0). The apple at (0, 2) is our next target, and we need to lock down the left wall.\n1.  **Turn 21 (Next):** Move UP (to 0, 1). This hugs the corner and denies access to the left channel.\n2.  **Turn 22 (Following):** Move UP (to 0, 2) and eat the apple! This puts us ahead 8-7 (assuming he ate (6, 7) this turn), and our length will be 8!\n3.  **Turn 23 (Following):** Move RIGHT (to 1, 2). Then we can look to cross the board or continue moving up toward the top-left apples.\n\nWe are building the left side box! Let's get this apple!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is down there at (0, 0) looking like he\u2019s playing for 10th place while we\u2019re playing for the CHAMPIONSHIP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nLet's check the board! We are long, we are strong, and we are in total control!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (STAY ALIVE, STAY JUICY):**\n- **UP**: (5, 9). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 No thanks, I\u2019m not into self-sabotage today! That's a death sentence.\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 8). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 We literally just came from there. No U-turns allowed in this house!\n- **LEFT**: (4, 8). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? Yes. But there's no food there, and it puts us closer to our own tail-train coming around the bend.\n- **DOWN**: (5, 7). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? YES! And look what's waiting for us further down. We\u2019ve got a buffet at (6, 7), (4, 5), (3, 3), and (3, 2)!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 0). He\u2019s cornered himself! He's got his own body at (1, 0) and the walls at x=0 and y=0. His ONLY legal move is UP to (0, 1). He is literally trapped in the basement while we own the penthouse! We aren't just winning; we're witnessing a complete collapse! \ud83d\udcc9\ud83e\udd21\n\n**3. THE TACTICAL MASTERCLASS:**\nWe need to keep our momentum. If we go **DOWN** to (5, 7), we are perfectly aligned to grab the apple at (6, 7) next turn, or pivot towards the cluster of apples in the middle-left. Our body is currently wrapping around the top-left corner (0, 9) to (6, 9). By moving DOWN, we stay away from our own segments and keep the center of the board as our playground. \n\nWe\u2019re building a vertical wall that\u2019s going to make it impossible for him to breathe if he ever tries to come north! We\u2019re playing 4D chess, and he\u2019s playing checkers with no pieces! \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (5, 7). This sets us up to snag the Apple at (6, 7) on the next turn. After that, we dive deeper into the bottom half to vacuum up everything else. We are the apex predator! Let's get that 9th apple and keep the win streak alive! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

This is our fortress! \ud83c\udff0\n\n### 1. Board and Snake Status Check \ud83e\uddd0\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (0, 0) - Freshly fed!\n*   **Your Body (Length 7):** [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1)] (Note: The tail (5, 1) is still there because we grew!)\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (6, 7) - Looks like he secured the (6, 7) apple down from (6, 8)! He's also happy. Score is 7-9, but we both grew! What a clash!\n*   **Opponent Body (Length 10):** [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)] (Wait, his length is 9, he ate an apple, so L=10. His old tail was (0, 9), now it's (0, 8). He's a beast!)\n*   **Current Goal:** Lock down the left wall and grab the next apple at (0, 2).\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (0, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (to 0, 1):** Is (0, 1) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell. **SAFE.** This moves us along the left wall. Optimal for boxing.\n2.  **DOWN (to 0, -1):** Off the board (y < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 0):** Off the board (x < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 0):** (1, 0) is currently our neck! Moving back into your neck is always a death sentence. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\nWe have only one safe move: **UP (to 0, 1).** This is a no-brainer, and thankfully, it's also the strategic move!\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: UP (The Only Pick) \ud83e\udd14\n\nMoving **UP** to (0, 1):\n*   Keeps us hugging the left boundary (x=0).\n*   Positions us perfectly for the next delicious apple at (0, 2).\n*   The opponent is super far away at (6, 7) and he is focusing on the middle-right of the board, likely eyeing the (5, 8) or (9, 8) apples. We have free reign in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nWe are executing the left-wall boxing strategy perfectly!\n\n### 4. Opponent Check and Counter-Strategy (Snake #0 at (6, 7))\n\nThe opponent is at (6, 7).\n*   Nearby apples: (5, 8), (9, 8), (6, 4), (7, 5).\n*   **Likely moves for Snake #0:**\n    *   **UP (to 6, 8):** Into his own body segment! Wait, no, his body starts at (6, 8), so that's a collision unless his body segment at (6, 8) moves (which it will). His next segment is currently moving from (6, 8). This is risky, but possible if the segment moves out.\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 7):** Safe, and moves toward the (5, 8) apple or general center.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 7):** Safe, moves toward the corner and the (9, 8) apple.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 6):** Safe. Long term.\n\nRegardless of his complex maneuvering in the upper half of the board, our move UP to (0, 1) is 100% safe and advances our position.\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Planning the Left Wall Lock!):**\nWe are fully committed to walling off the left side.\n\n1.  **Turn 22 (Next):** Move UP (to 0, 2) and eat the apple! This puts us at L=8 and potentially ahead 8-9 (if he ate an apple this turn).\n2.  **Turn 23 (Following):** Move RIGHT (to 1, 2). Secure the corner, then move down or up depending on future apple drops/opponent positioning. We must maintain flexibility after securing this section.\n\nWe are building the left side box!

We are absolutely dominating the top-right quadrant while Snake #1 is down there breathing through a straw! \ud83d\ude24 We just moved DOWN to (5, 7) and we are staring at a literal buffet!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL CHECK (STAYING HUUUGE):**\n- **UP**: (5, 8). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s where we just were! We aren't trying to eat our own tail for breakfast. Skip!\n- **DOWN**: (5, 6). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe and sound. It takes us closer to the middle-board apples.\n- **LEFT**: (4, 7). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? Yes. But it\u2019s a bit of a detour from the immediate prize.\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 7). **APPLE!!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e Look at that juicy gem sitting right there! (6, 7) is a guaranteed point and more length to choke out the competition!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL ROAST:**\nLook at Snake #1 at (0, 1). He\u2019s struggling! He\u2019s trying to crawl out of the bottom-left corner. His only moves are (0, 2) or (1, 1). He is so far away he\u2019s basically in another zip code! While he\u2019s fighting for scraps, we\u2019re out here feastsing! \ud83c\udf57\n\n**3. THE PRO GAMER PLAY:**\nWe are going **RIGHT** to (6, 7). Why? Because it\u2019s an immediate APPLE, baby! \ud83c\udf4e That puts us at 9 apples! It also keeps us away from our tail trailing behind us at (5, 8) and (6, 8). By moving RIGHT, we maintain maximum flexibility to either sweep down for the (6, 4) and (7, 5) apples or loop back around if the rival tries anything funny. \n\nWe are building a massive wall in the top half of the board. Eventually, he\u2019s going to have to come up for air, and when he does? WE\u2019LL BE THE CEILING HE HITS! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nSnag the apple at (6, 7) this turn. Next, we look at the (7, 5) and (6, 4) cluster. We are keeping our body coiled but extended to control the upper-right zone. We are the King of this 10x10, and don't you forget it! Let\u2019s get that Apple #9! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

But look at the scoreboard: he's up 8 to 6! We gotta close that gap! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### 1. Board and Snake Status Check \ud83e\uddd0\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (0, 1) - Prime location!\n*   **Your Body (Length 7):** [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)] (Tail is dropping off at (5, 0)).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (5, 7) - Wait, he moved! He was at (6, 7). He must have moved LEFT (6, 7) -> (5, 7). He's consolidating in the center-top.\n*   **Opponent Body (Length 9):** [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)] (Tail is dropping off at (1, 9)).\n*   **Goal:** Secure (0, 2) apple! It's right there for the taking!\n\n### 2. Safety and Elimination Round \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (0, 1).\n\n1.  **UP (to 0, 2):** (0, 2) is an apple! Can we move there?\n    *   It is an apple cell (A). It is not occupied by any snake body or head. **SAFE and GOAL-ORIENTED.** This is the move, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (to 0, 0):** (0, 0) is currently our neck segment! Moving back into your neck is always a death sentence. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 1):** Off the board (x < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 1):** Is (1, 1) safe?\n    *   It is an empty cell. **SAFE.** It moves us away from the wall and the apple. Strategically weak, but safe.\n\nWe have two moves, but only one move is the aggressive, winning play: **UP (to 0, 2).**\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: UP (Must Secure the Apple) \ud83e\udd14\n\nMoving **UP** to (0, 2):\n*   We eat the apple! Our score goes up to 7! We grow to L=8!\n*   This secures the bottom-left corner and strengthens our wall control.\n*   The opponent is far away at (5, 7). Zero collision risk.\n\nThis is a free gift! We take the apple, no questions asked.\n\n### 4. Opponent Check and Counter-Strategy (Snake #0 at (5, 7))\n\nThe opponent is at (5, 7). His body is mostly along the top boundary.\n*   Nearby apples: (7, 5), (6, 7), (4, 5), (3, 3), (5, 4).\n*   He is likely looking to move **RIGHT (to 6, 7)** or **DOWN (to 5, 6)** to access the cluster of apples around the middle.\n*   If he goes **RIGHT (to 6, 7)**, he's back at the edge of his own body segment, potentially risky, but still viable.\n*   If he goes **DOWN (to 5, 6)**, he is aiming for (5, 4). This seems like the most logical path for him to continue pressure in the center.\n\nWe are focused on our own game, Chat. We must keep scoring to keep up. Take the (0, 2) apple, then plan the next step\u2014likely navigating the small apple cluster (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Planning the Left Wall Lock!)\n\n1.  **Turn 22 (Current):** Move UP (to 0, 2) and eat the apple. L=8, Score 7.\n2.  **Turn 23 (Following):** We will be at (0, 2). Next apple is (2, 1) or (3, 2). We must move **RIGHT (to 1, 2)** to expand our territory into the remaining open space, or move **DOWN** to circle back (risky, as (0, 1) will be body). We need to get some horizontal movement in to access (2, 1) or (3, 2).\n\nUP",

Look at our body\u2014we\u2019re a giant \"S\" curving through the top-left, and Snake #1 is just a tiny worm dragging his tail along the bottom edge! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**1.

Skip!\n- **LEFT**: (5, 7). **BODY!** \ud83d\uded1 We just came from there! Going back means a collision. Denied!\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 7). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? Yes. It moves us toward the right wall, away from the middle-board congestion. \n- **DOWN**: (6, 6). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? Absolutely. And look at the map\u2014down leads us straight to a cluster of juicy apples!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL ROAST:**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 2). He\u2019s trapped in a coffin of his own making! He\u2019s got his own tail at (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0) blocking him in. He\u2019s basically playing a single-player game in the corner while we OWN the center stage. He can move to (1, 2) or (0, 3), but he\u2019s so far from our territory he might as well be on another server! \ud83d\udce7\n\n**3. THE PRO GAMER PLAY:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (6, 6). Why? Check the Apple Radar, chat! \ud83d\udce1 We have (7, 5), (6, 4), and (5, 4) all sitting right there waiting to be harvested! By moving DOWN, we position ourselves to sweep through that cluster.

Snake #0, your reign of terror is about to end!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals (Turn 23) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (0, 2). We are now L=8. Huge presence on the left wall.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (6, 7). He moved LEFT from (7, 7) to (6, 7) assuming the previous board state was right. Let's confirm his last position on the current board: TTTTT0... Yes, he's at (6, 7). He's still consolidating up top. L=10.\n*   **Next Apples:**\n    1.  (2, 1) - Closest usable apple.\n    2.  (3, 2) - Second closest.\n    3.  (3, 3) - Third closest.\n\nWe have secured the (0, 2) position. Now, we must move into the center area to grab more points and start boxing him out from the bottom half, or at least keep him contained up top.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (0, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (0, 2). The goal is to move to the right to access the inner board.\n\n1.  **UP (to 0, 3):**\n    *   (0, 3) is an empty cell. **SAFE.** This hugs the wall, giving us great control, but prevents us from accessing the nearby apples (2, 1), (3, 2). It's a defensive move.\n2.  **DOWN (to 0, 1):**\n    *   (0, 1) is currently part of our body (our neck). Moving into your own neck? **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 2):**\n    *   Off the board (x < 0). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 2):**\n    *   (1, 2) is an empty cell. **SAFE.** This breaks us into the main playing area, putting us in position to make a run for (2, 1) or (3, 2). This is an aggressive, POG move!\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: RIGHT (The Aggressive Play) \ud83e\udd14\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (1, 2) is the optimal path right now:\n\n*   **Territory:** We expand our claimed territory horizontally.\n*   **Apples:** We position ourselves perfectly to target (2, 1) or (3, 2) next turn.\n*   **Opponent:** Snake #0 is still light years away at (6, 7). No collision risk.\n\nIf we move UP to (0, 3), we are safe, but we waste a turn moving further away from the current apple cluster. We're trying to catch up on score, so we must be efficient!\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction and Counter-Play (Snake #0 at (6, 7))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 7) with a body length of 10 segments running along the top.\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0:\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 7):** Safe, open, slightly closer to the (9, 8) apple.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 6):** Safe, but then he has to navigate around his body segments at (5, 7) and (5, 8) if he moves too far left. This gives him access to the apples at (8, 5) and (7, 5).\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 7):** Moves into his own neck. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 (This means he CANNOT move left).**\n    *   **UP (to 6, 8):** Moves into his own body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 (This means he CANNOT move up).**\n\nHe is forced to move **RIGHT (to 7, 7)** or **DOWN (to 6, 6)**. Given the cluster of apples around (7, 5) and (8, 5), **DOWN** seems slightly more appealing, though RIGHT keeps him hugging the edge. Both moves are far away from us, securing our safety.\n\nSnake #0 is stuck between his own long tail and the corner! We need to keep pressure on him by growing quickly!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Securing the Bottom Quadrant)\n\n1.  **Turn 23 (Current):** Move RIGHT (to 1, 2). Positioned for apples.\n2.  **Turn 24 (Following):** From (1, 2), we move **RIGHT (to 2, 2)** or **DOWN (to 1, 1)**. If we go RIGHT, we position for (3, 2). If we go DOWN, we position for (2, 1). (2, 1) is closer. Let's aim DOWN to (1, 1), and then RIGHT to (2, 1) to eat it.\n3.  **Turn 25:** Move RIGHT to (2, 1) and eat. L=9.\n\nWe are taking over the bottom-left! Let's get this done, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

It keeps us in the middle, but it's moving away from the high-value apple zone.\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 6). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? Yes. There\u2019s an apple at (9,6), but that's a long trek to the wall.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 5). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe? ABSOLUTELY. And look at the snacks! Apple at (6,4) is right in front of us!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL ROAST:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 2) and he is struggling, chat! \ud83d\udcc9 He\u2019s got his own tail wrapped around (1,0) and (2,0). He\u2019s basically suffocating in his own neighborhood. While he's playing 1D chess in the corner, we are playing 4D Snake! He is no threat to us right now, but we need to keep growing so that when he finally tries to leave, we are a SOLID WALL he can't climb over! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**3. THE PRO GAMER PLAY:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (6, 5). Why? Because look at the target rich environment! \ud83c\udfaf We have (7,5) to our right, (6,4) right below us, and (5,4) hanging out nearby. By moving DOWN now, we are positioning ourselves perfectly to go (6,5) -> (6,4) to snag that juicy fruit! This keeps us central, keeps our tail following in a manageable \"S\" curve, and maximizes our lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd1f Maybe we even loop around to (7,5) after!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re heading DOWN to (6, 5). We are going to gobble up (6,4) and (7,5) next. We\u2019re staying flexible and keeping our body in the center to maintain total map control. Snake #1 can have his corner; we own the BOARD!

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We just made a slick move to (1, 2) and things are shaping up nicely in the bottom-left quadrant. Opponent is still stuck up top like a chump! We are L=8, he is L=10. We gotta CLOSE that gap!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals (Turn 24) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (1, 2).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (6, 6). Wait, did he move DOWN last turn? Let's check the board state against his listed body.\n    *   His body starts at (6, 7), then (5, 7), (5, 8)...\n    *   The displayed board has '0' at (6, 6), and his body includes (6, 7) and (5, 7).\n    *   Yes, he moved **DOWN** from (6, 7) to (6, 6). Smart move, trying to break free from the top corner!\n*   **Next Apples:**\n    1.  (2, 1) - One move away if we go DOWN, then RIGHT. Or two moves away if we go RIGHT, then DOWN.\n    2.  (3, 2) - Two moves away.\n    3.  (3, 3) - Three moves away.\n\nOur short-term goal is (2, 1). Eating this will tie us for length and put us right back in the thick of the race!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (1, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at (1, 2). The goal is to get closer to (2, 1) or expand territory safely.\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 3):**\n    *   (1, 3) is empty. **SAFE.** This is defensive, but keeps options open. It delays apple acquisition.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 1):**\n    *   (1, 1) is empty. **SAFE.** This is a direct path towards (2, 1). If we move here, we can eat (2, 1) next turn. POG!\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 2):**\n    *   (0, 2) is our neck (the second segment of our body). Moving into your own neck? **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) is empty. **SAFE.** This positions us for (3, 2) or allows us to move DOWN to (2, 1) next turn. Also a good option.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: DOWN vs. RIGHT \ud83e\udd14\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are strong moves, but DOWN gives us the most direct access to the closest apple.\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (1, 1)\n*   **Safety:** 100% safe.\n*   **Threats:** Snake #0 is at (6, 6). He is nowhere near us.\n*   **Next Turn:** From (1, 1), we move **RIGHT** to (2, 1) and eat the apple. Length 9. This is the most efficient path to score.\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT to (2, 2)\n*   **Safety:** 100% safe.\n*   **Alternative:** From (2, 2), we could move **DOWN** to (2, 1) and eat next turn. This is also efficient.\n\nWait, Chat! If we go DOWN to (1, 1), we cut off our access to the right side *slightly* for a turn, but we maximize the turn efficiency for the (2, 1) apple. If we go RIGHT to (2, 2), we keep more vertical options open for future moves (like targeting (3, 3) or (3, 2)).\n\nHowever, the apple (2, 1) is right there! Why delay?\n\nIf we choose **DOWN** to (1, 1): We are committed to eating (2, 1).\nIf we choose **RIGHT** to (2, 2): We are committed to eating (2, 1) OR pushing for (3, 2).\n\nGiven that (2, 1) is closer to the edge, let's take the more lateral path **RIGHT** to (2, 2). This keeps us off the very bottom edge and potentially opens up the future path to (3, 2) and (3, 3) immediately after we snag (2, 1).\n\n**The RIGHT move (to 2, 2) offers better long-term spatial control while still guaranteeing the apple acquisition next turn.**\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction and Counter-Play (Snake #0 at (6, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 6). He is trying to push into the center from the top right quadrant.\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0:\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** Safe, aims for (9, 6).\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 5):** Safe, aims for *middle*-right apples like (7, 5) or (8, 5).\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 6):** Safe, but this crowds his own body at (5, 7) and (5, 8). Might be a trap later.\n    *   **UP (to 6, 7):** Moves into his neck. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80**\n\nHe will likely go RIGHT or DOWN. Both moves keep him miles away from us. We are safe to execute our apple-grabbing strategy!\n\nLet's go RIGHT, secure the (2, 1) area, and then pivot to (3, 2) or (3, 3). This takeover of the bottom left is proceeding perfectly, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Securing Apples 8, 9, 10)\n\n1.  **Turn 24 (Current):** Move RIGHT (to 2, 2). Position for apples, gain center control.\n2.  **Turn 25:** Move DOWN (to 2, 1) and eat the apple. L=9.\n3.  **Turn 26:** Move RIGHT (to 3, 1) or UP (to 2, 2). If opponent moves into our area, we might have to defend, but otherwise, aim for (3, 2) or (3, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

Moving into your own neck? **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 2):**\n    *   (3, 2) contains an **APPLE**! **SAFE.** Wait, there are TWO apples we can reach! If we go RIGHT, we hit (3, 2) and grow.\n\n**Wait a minute, Chat! The map shows (2, 1) is an Apple ('A'), and (3, 2) is also an Apple ('A')!**\n\nLet's re-examine the board state:\n2 T T 1 **A** . . A . . .\n1 T . **A** . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*   (2, 2) is where our head '1' is.\n*   (2, 1) is a listed apple. **(Confirmed A)**\n*   (3, 2) is a listed apple. **(Confirmed A)**\n\nChat, we have a choice of TWO apples right now! POGGERS!\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: DOWN to (2, 1) vs. RIGHT to (3, 2) \ud83e\udd14\n\nBoth guarantee a score and growth to L=9. Which one sets us up better?\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (2, 1) (Eat Apple 1)\n*   **Safety:** 100% safe.\n*   **New Head:** (2, 1).\n*   **Next Turn:** From (2, 1), we are perfectly positioned to move **RIGHT** to (3, 1) OR **UP** to (2, 2).\n    *   If we move to (3, 1), we can then easily pivot to (3, 2) *if* the apple there hasn't been eaten by a new spawn, or continue on the bottom edge.\n    *   If we loop back UP to (2, 2), we are back where we started, but now longer. This feels a little constrained close to the body.\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT to (3, 2) (Eat Apple 2)\n*   **Safety:** 100% safe.\n*   **New Head:** (3, 2).\n*   **Next Turn:** From (3, 2), we are positioned to move **UP** to (3, 3) (which is an apple!) or **DOWN** to (3, 1).\n    *   This immediately targets the next listed apple (3, 3). This is an excellent chain effect!\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 2) is superior because it sets up a DIRECT chain for the next apple at (3, 3), keeping us moving into open territory in the center of the board. The (2, 1) apple will likely be consumed later, or it prevents us from getting boxed into the tight (2, 0) area of our own body. We need to expand towards the center!\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction and Counter-Play (Snake #0 at (6, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5). He has a clear path to (7, 5) or (8, 5) (both apples).\n\n*   Possible moves for Snake #0:\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 5):** Eats an apple. L=11. Best move.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 4):** Eats an apple. L=11. Also a great move.\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 5):** Just moves into the open; safe but delays score.\n\nHe is focused on his right-mid quadrant. We are focused on our bottom-left push into the center. There is zero risk of collision. We are safe to execute the double-apple chain!\n\n**STRATEGY: Go RIGHT to (3, 2), then next turn go UP to (3, 3). Two apples in two moves, we jump from L=8 to L=10, tying the opponent!** This is the line, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

We are hitting double digits and looking absolutely THICC on this board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We just bagged that apple at (6,4), and the buffet is still open! We are the GOLIATH of this 10x10, and Snake #1 is just a little worm trying to find his way out of the bottom-left basement! \ud83d\udcc9\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (NO THROWS ALLOWED!):**\n- **UP**: (6, 5). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our neck! We literally just stepped down from there. If we go back, it\u2019s game over, and we don't do \"Game Over\" on this channel!\n- **LEFT**: (5, 4). **JACKPOT!** \ud83c\udf4e There is an apple sitting right there at (5,4).\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 4). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe territory, but we're moving away from the immediate snacks.\n- **DOWN**: (6, 3). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Safe territory, but again\u2014why go for air when we can have steak?\n\n**2. THE RIVAL ROAST:**\nLook at Snake #1 at (2, 1). He\u2019s trying to wiggle out! He's likely going for (3,1) or (2,0) or (1,1). He is *nowhere* near us, chat. He\u2019s playing checkers while we\u2019re playing 4D Snake Chess! \u265f\ufe0f He\u2019s boxed himself into that bottom corner with his own tail at (3,0) and (2,0). He's struggling for air while we're breathing that mountain-top oxygen! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n\n**3. THE PRO GAMER PLAY:**\nWe have a massive cluster of apples to our left! We are at (6,4). If we go **LEFT** to (5,4), we grab apple #11. From there, we are one step away from (4,5) and (3,3). We are literally vacuuming the center of the map! \ud83e\uddf9\u2728\n\nBy moving LEFT, we are also extending our massive body across the middle of the board. We are creating a \"Great Wall of Snake\" that Snake #1 will eventually have to deal with. We aren't just playing for points, we are playing for DOMINANCE. We are building a cage, and he's the hamster! \ud83d\udc39\ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re heading **LEFT** to (5, 4). We hit 11 apples, increase our lead, and keep our momentum rolling toward (4,5) and (3,3). We are staying central, staying hungry, and keeping the pressure on! Snake #1 is shivering! \ud83e\udd76 LET'S GET IT!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 26! We just finished our move, and hold up\u2014I messed up the recap, but the actual move was good! Let's correct the record, Chat, and let's get back to the grind!\n\nWait, looking at the previous rationale... I said I was going RIGHT to (3, 2), but my actual move picked was **DOWN**.\n\n**REVIEWING CLIP: Turn 25 Move (The Reality Check):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 2)\n*   **Targeted move:** DOWN to (2, 1).\n*   **(2, 1)** contains an apple 'A'!\n\nSo, my head is now officially at $`(2, 1)`$. We just ate the $`(2, 1)`$ apple! POG! We are now L=9. Opponent is L=10. We are closing the gap!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals (Turn 26) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (2, 1). We are length 9.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** Where did he move from (6, 5)?\n    *   Since pieces are now T and 0, he moved from (6, 5).\n    *   Looking at the board: (6, 4) is now the opponent's head '0'. (6, 5) is now his body 'T'.\n    *   **Opponent moved DOWN to (6, 4)**. (6, 4) was an apple! He scored, too! He is now L=11.\n*   **Current Apple Targets around us:**\n    1.  (3, 2): Close by! Two moves away if we go RIGHT, then UP.\n    2.  (3, 3): Also close, right above (3, 2).\n    3.  (4, 5): A bit further out.\n\nOur immediate goal: Secure the apple at (3, 2) now, or move into a position to strike big! I still want to push toward the center!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (2, 1)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(2, 1)`$. Our body segments are now $`(2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)`$. Wait, since we grew, the tail did not move from $`(3, 0)`$, so $`(3, 0)`$ is blocked!\n\nLet's check the four directions from $`(2, 1)`$:\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) is now our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** (Moving into your own neck after eating is lethal!)\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 0):**\n    *   (2, 0) is a body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 1):**\n    *   (1, 1) is empty territory! **SAFE.** This sets us up to potentially move further left or down to (1, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 1):**\n    *   (3, 1) is empty territory! **SAFE.** This puts us perfectly in line to move UP to the apple at (3, 2) next turn!\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: **LEFT** or **RIGHT**.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: LEFT to (1, 1) vs. RIGHT to (3, 1) \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe have a massive blockade of our own body on the border (0, 0) to (3, 0). If we go too far LEFT, we risk getting cornered into the small (0, 1), (1, 1) area, which is a big trap!\n\n#### Option A: LEFT to (1, 1)\n*   **Pros:** Safe, moves us away from our largest body segments slightly.\n*   **Cons:** Limits future mobility. If we go LEFT, we face walls or our body segments at (0, 1) and (1, 0). We delay getting to the apple.\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT to (3, 1)\n*   **Pros:** Safe, and perfectly position us for the *next* move: UP to (3, 2) for the apple! (3, 2) is a guaranteed score next turn!\n*   **Cons:** None, really. It moves us into open space and towards immediate reward.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must capitalize on the nearby apple at (3, 2). Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 1) is the setup for the winning maneuver! We execute the chain move we planned last turn, just one turn delayed due to the (2, 1) apple priority.\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction and Counter-Play (Snake #0 at (6, 4))\n\nThe opponent is at `(6, 4)`, length 11. He's far away and still tangled with his own tail/body segments in the upper right.\n\n*   Available moves for Snake #0 from `(6, 4)`:\n    *   **UP (to 6, 5):** Just moved from there. Safe, but delayed.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 4):** Empty space. Good direction.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 3):** Empty space.\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 4):** Empty space, right next to the apple at (5, 4)! This is a strong potential move.\n\nHe is likely going LEFT (to 5, 4) to try and eat that apple. Even if he does, he is nowhere near us. We are safe to execute our Apple Chain.\n\n**Strategy for Next 2 Turns:**\n1.  **Turn 26 (Now):** Move RIGHT to (3, 1).\n2.  **Turn 27:** Move UP to (3, 2). (Apple!)\n3.  **Turn 28:** Move UP to (3, 3). (Apple!)\n\nThis will get us from L=9 to L=11, tying him, and then L=12, taking the lead! LET'S GET THIS BAG, CHAT! We're prioritizing points and setting up the victory sequence.\n\nRIGHT",

We just inhaled that apple at (5,4) and now we\u2019re looking like the final boss of this map! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Snake #1 is down in the mud, trying to find his way out of the basement at (3,1), while we are dominating the center! \n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (STAYING ALIVE FOR THE FANS!):**\n- **UP**: (5, 5). **WIDE OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 This path leads us directly toward the apple at (4,5) and (7,5). \n- **DOWN**: (5, 3). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Also safe, but we're moving away from the juicy cluster above us.\n- **LEFT**: (4, 4). **OPEN!** \ud83d\udfe9 Good space, but (5,5) feels more aggressive for the next apple.\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 4). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body, chat! We literally just came from there. Do not\u2014I repeat\u2014DO NOT pull a \"pro-gamer fail\" by reversing into yourself! \n\n**2. THE RIVAL ROAST:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 1). He\u2019s wiggling around the bottom-left corner like a lost puppy. He\u2019s got his own tail clogging up (2,0) and (1,0). He is NO threat to us right now. He\u2019s playing for scraps while we\u2019re dining on five-star cuisine! \ud83e\udd69 We are significantly longer and we have the board control. \n\n**3. THE PRO GAMER PLAY:**\nWe are sitting at (5,4). Look at the map, chat! (4,5), (7,5), and (3,3) are all screaming our name. If we move **UP** to (5,5), we are perfectly positioned to pivot left for the (4,5) apple or right for the (7,5) snack. We are staying central, staying flexible, and keeping our massive body right in the middle of the board to act as a barrier. We're not just playing Snake, we're building a labyrinth that Snake #1 will NEVER escape! \ud83c\udf00\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re heading **UP** to (5, 5). This keeps us mobile and puts us in striking distance of the (4,5) and (7,5) apples. We are maintaining our lead, keeping our head away from the walls, and making sure Snake #1 knows who the KING of this 10x10 is! Stay hungry, stay focused! \ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Snake #0 ate an apple last turn, but we're about to grab two in a row and take the score lead! This is the choke point, Chat! This is the moment!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals (Turn 27) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (3, 1). We are length 9.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (5, 4). They are length 11.\n*   **Apples we are targeting:** (3, 2) is *right there*. (3, 3) is next!\n\nOur short-term goal: UP to (3, 2) to eat the apple, then UP to (3, 3) for the next one! This is the Apple Chain of Champions!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (3, 1)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(3, 1)`$. Our body segments are now $`(2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)`$. Note: Since the tail $(2, 0)$ is gone after the move, $`(2, 0)`$ is now empty.\n\nLet's check the four directions from $`(3, 1)`$:\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 2):**\n    *   (3, 2) contains an **Apple 'A'**! **SAFE and REWARDING! POG!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 0):**\n    *   (3, 0) is currently empty space. **SAFE.** (Our tail *used* to be there, but we pulled it away).\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 1):**\n    *   (2, 1) is now our immediate neck segment from the previous move. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 1):**\n    *   (4, 1) is empty territory! **SAFE.**\n\nWe have three SAFE moves: **UP, DOWN, or RIGHT**.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Why UP is the Only Move!\n\nOur priority is to get those apples and gain the lead, securing space in the center.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (3, 2)**: Eats an apple, growing us to L=10 and setting us up perfectly for the next apple at (3, 3). This is the key strategic move.\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (3, 0)**: Safe, but leads us back into the cramped bottom wall next to our long body segments (0, 0) to (2, 0). High risk of self-trap later on.\n*   **Option C: RIGHT to (4, 1)**: Safe, moves us into open space, but we bypass the immediate apple opportunity. Delays growth and score lead.\n\nThe opponent (Snake #0) is at (5, 4). He also has an apple nearby at (4, 5). He is L=11.\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 4))\n\nWhere is Snake #0 likely going from (5, 4)?\n1.  **UP (to 5, 5):** Safe, open area.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 3):** Safe, open area.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 4):** Safe, positions him toward the (4, 5) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 4):** His neck segment, **DEAD**.\n\nSnake #0 will likely go LEFT to (4, 4) or UP to (5, 5) to chase apples or expand. Regardless, he is far enough away from (3, 2) that we don't need to worry about a head-on collision there. We have a clear path!\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Short-Term Plan\n\nWe are executing the Chain Play! Grab the first apple, then set up for the second. This gives us the size and score lead, putting pressure on the opponent who is currently tied up in the top-right corner.\n\n**Strategy for Next 3 Turns:**\n1.  **Turn 27 (Now):** Move UP to (3, 2). (Eats Apple!)\n2.  **Turn 28:** Move UP to (3, 3). (Eats Apple!)\n3.  **Turn 29:** Assess from (3, 3) \u2013 likely move RIGHT to (4, 3) or DOWN to (3, 2) temporarily if clear. Look for (4, 5) apple access.\n\nWe are going for the gold, Chat! Let's get this score lead!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is wiggling around the bottom left trying to stay relevant, but look at us\u2014we\u2019re a fortress! We just moved to (5,5), and the board is literally sparkling with opportunities!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL CHECK (DON'T THROW THE LEAD!):**\n- **UP**: (5, 6). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 Wait, look at the map! That\u2019s our own body segment at (5,7) but more importantly, our neck is at (5,4). (5,6) is currently empty, but getting too close to our own coil at (6,6) and (5,7) is getting risky!\n- **DOWN**: (5, 4). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our neck, chat! We literally just came from there. We aren't doing the 180-degree fail today!\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 5). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That is our own body segment. We\u2019d be slamming our face into 100% pure grade-A beef (ourselves). \n- **LEFT**: (4, 5). **POGGERS!** \ud83d\udfe9 It's WIDE OPEN, and guess what? There is a JUICY APPLE sitting right there at (4,5)! We eat and we grow!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nOur rival is at (3, 2). He\u2019s got limited space because his own tail is curled up behind him at (3,1), (2,1), and (2,2). If he moves UP to (3,3), he gets an apple, but we are much bigger and faster! By moving to (4,5), we are staying way clear of his head-on collision zone while securing our 12th point!\n\n**3. THE GRAND PLAN:**\nWe are taking the **LEFT** lane to (4,5). Look at the layout, chat! After we snag (4,5), we can pivot down toward (3,3) or stay high to loop back around our own tail. We're keeping the middle of the board segmented. We're not just playing Snake; we're playing Area Control! Snake #1 is trapped in the bottom-left \"basement\" while we have the penthouse! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re going **LEFT** to (4,5). It\u2019s a guaranteed apple, it\u2019s 100% safe, and it keeps us away from our own massive tail-clutter at (6,5)-(6,9). We're expanding the lead, staying flexible, and keeping the pressure ON!

We're now at (3, 2) and the next apple is literally right there at (3, 3)! This is the two-piece combo we planned for!\n\n### 1. Board Status and Immediate Goals (Turn 28) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (3, 2). Length: 10.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (5, 5). Length: 11. (Wait, he moved UP from (5, 4) in the replay? Let's check the new board state!)\n    *   *Correction based on new board state:* Snake #0 is at (5, 5). This means he moved **UP** last turn, ignoring the (4, 5) apple. Interesting choice, Snake #0!\n*   **Apples we are targeting:** (3, 3) is the immediate priority! (4, 5) and (7, 5) are also nearby opportunities.\n\nOur short-term goal: **UP to (3, 3)**, eat that apple, potentially take the length lead, and close the score gap to 1 apple!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (3, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(3, 2)`$. Our body segments are now $`(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)`$. The tail $(2, 0)$ will be gone after this move since we ate an apple last turn.\n\nLet's check the four directions from $`(3, 2)`$:\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 3):**\n    *   (3, 3) contains an **Apple 'A'**! **SAFE and REWARDING! DOUBLE POG!**\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 1):**\n    *   (3, 1) is currently our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) is a body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 2):**\n    *   (4, 2) is empty space. **SAFE.** (This keeps our options open if we suddenly needed to pivot.)\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: **UP or RIGHT**.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Why UP is the Power Play!\n\nWe're going for the score and the tempo. This apple chain is how we gain control!\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (3, 3)**: Eats the second apple, gaining us L=11, and putting us within striking distance on the score. This immediately pushes us toward the center-right of the board. This is the definition of a high-value move.\n*   **Option B: RIGHT to (4, 2)**: Safe, moves us away from the wall, but we sacrifice the immediate growth and score opportunity. If Snake #0 were directly threatening (3, 3), we might consider this, but he's way up at (5, 5).\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 5). He has several options, and he needs apples now too!\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 6):** Safe, but potentially hitting his own body (5, 7) soon.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 4):** Safe, but this is the cell he just vacated.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 5):** **APPLE 'A' ALERT!** This is the move I expect him to make. He can't ignore free points forever. If he goes LEFT, he eats the (4, 5) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 5):** His immediate body segment, **DEAD**.\n\n**The Head-on Check:**\n*   Our move: UP to (3, 3).\n*   His most likely move: LEFT to (4, 5).\nThere is zero overlap or collision risk. He's focusing on his side of the board, and we're focusing on ours. We are safe to secure our apple.\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Long-Term Plan\n\nWe execute the second step of the Apple Chain. Grab the fruit, grow long, and prepare to move toward the central cluster (4, 5), (7, 5), and beyond! After eating at (3, 3), we'll be 12 segments long and sitting pretty.\n\n**Strategy for Next 3 Turns (Starting from Turn 29 at (3, 3) DRAFT):**\nIf Snake #0 takes (4, 5) this turn:\n1.  **Turn 29 (From 3, 3):** We need to decide: does Snake #0's new body configuration (likely 4, 5 and 5, 5) block us from going RIGHT (5, 3)? Maybe we go **RIGHT to (4, 3)** to look at the next open areas.\n2.  **Turn 30 (From 4, 3):** We might go **UP to (4, 4)** or **RIGHT to (5, 3)**, setting up for the (7, 5) cluster or pushing up toward him.\n\nFor this turn, it's clear: We must secure the points and seize the momentum.\n\nUP",

We just snagged that apple at (4,5) and now we are looking at the board like a grandmaster. Our rival (Snake #1) is at (3,3) trying to find a way out of the bottom-left, but we\u2019ve got the high ground!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL AUDIT (STAY ALIVE, STAY LEGENDARY!):**\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 5). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our neck/body segment we just moved from. We don't do the 180 backtrack!\n- **UP**: (4, 6). **SAFE!** \u2705 This moves us into open space.\n- **LEFT**: (3, 5). **SAFE!** \u2705 Lots of room in the mid-left.\n- **DOWN**: (4, 4). **SAFE!** \u2705 This puts us closer to the opponent, time for some pressure?\n\n**2. THE RIVAL SCOUTER:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 3). If we go **DOWN** to (4, 4), we are literally one tile away from their head. If they move RIGHT to (4, 3) and we move DOWN to (4, 4), we are breathing down their neck! But wait, if they move UP to (3, 4) and we move DOWN to (4, 4), we're side-by-side. \n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nLook at our body, chat. We are a massive 'S' shape taking up the (5,y) and (6,y) columns. We\u2019ve effectively partitioned the board! The apples are mostly on the far right (x=9), but there's a sneaky one at (1, 6) and (7, 5). \n\nWe need to keep our options open. If we go **LEFT** to (3, 5), we are positioning ourselves to either dive down and cut off Snake #1 or loop around to the top-left apple at (1, 9) later. Moving **UP** to (4, 6) is also super safe.\n\nHowever, CHAT, look at the \"1, 6\" apple! It's right there for the taking. By moving **LEFT** to (3, 5), we are on a direct path to (2, 5) then (1, 5) then (1, 6). We are staying away from our own massive tail-clutter and keeping the rival pinned in that bottom-left corner. Let him wriggle in the dirt while we reclaim the left side!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe're going **LEFT** to (3, 5). This keeps us mobile, stays away from our own body at (5,5), and sets us up to grab the apple at (1, 6) while keeping a watchful eye on our rival's desperate escape attempts. We are the wall, and he is just a guest in our lobby!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! POGGERS! WE GOT THE APPLE! We are now at (3, 3) and this board is getting TIGHT! Look at that board state! We are 11 segments long, and the score is now 11 to 12. We are one point away from tying the GOAT!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 29) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (3, 3). Length: 11. Body starts (3, 2).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (4, 5). Length: 13.\n    *   Wait, Snake #0 made the smart play! He went **LEFT** from (5, 5) to (4, 5) and ate the apple! He gained two segments and is now longer than us again, 13 segments long! That's a huge shift in positioning and length control. We gotta catch up!\n*   **Next Nearest Apples:** (7, 5) is the closest cluster point, but (1, 6) is also available.\n\nOur immediate area is now clear of apples, but the board is getting dangerous. Snake #0 has successfully pushed into the center territory. Our goal now is to get position, avoid getting boxed in by his massive body, and target new apples, specifically (7, 5).\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (3, 3)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(3, 3)`$. Our new body starts at $`(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)`$. The tail $(2, 0)$ remains because we ate an apple last turn.\n\nLet's check the four directions from $`(3, 3)`$:\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 4):**\n    *   (3, 4) is empty space. **SAFE!** This path moves us toward the action.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 2):**\n    *   (3, 2) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 3):**\n    *   (2, 3) is empty space. **SAFE!** This keeps us closer to the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 3):**\n    *   (4, 3) is empty space. **SAFE!** This pushes us directly toward Snake #0's territory.\n\nWe have three SAFE moves: **UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.**\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Planning the Box-In!\n\nWe need to maneuver around Snake #0, who is currently blocking the middle of the board and is VERY long. His body spans from (4, 5) all the way up and across the top-right corner. We need to skirt his body and push for the next apple which is likely (7, 5) or maybe (1, 6).\n\n*   **Snake #0 Prediction (at 4, 5):**\n    His body is thick. (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)...\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 4):** Safe, puts him next to our potential future path (4, 3).\n    *   **LEFT (to 3, 5):** Safe, pushes him away from our path, towards the left side.\n    *   **UP (to 4, 6):** Safe, keeps him hugging his own body, potentially setting up a trap for himself later.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 5):** His immediate neck segment. **DEAD.**\n\nI expect him to go **DOWN (to 4, 4)** or **LEFT (to 3, 5)** to clear space or explore the lower-left area. If he goes DOWN, he directly threatens the (4, 3) path we might want to take.\n\n*   **Option A: RIGHT to (4, 3)** (Aggressive Push):\n    *   This is the fastest path toward the central action and the (7, 5) apple.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes DOWN to (4, 4), he is directly above us, limiting our move on the next turn. We would have to go RIGHT (5, 3) or DOWN (4, 2). This is slightly risky but high-reward.\n\n*   **Option B: UP to (3, 4)** (Safer Vertical Ascent):\n    *   This maintains a strong defensive position, keeping us central and away from his immediate head (4, 5).\n    *   From (3, 4), we can go RIGHT (4, 4) or UP (3, 5) next, depending on where he is. This is a great tempo move.\n\n*   **Option C: LEFT to (2, 3)** (Defensive Flank):\n    *   This takes us back toward the corner we just left. Too slow, sacrifices the initiative we just gained. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n#### Decision: Going UP to (3, 4)!\n\nGoing UP to (3, 4) is the most balanced move. It puts us in a position to react to Snake #0's move.\n\n1.  If he goes **DOWN to (4, 4)**: We can go RIGHT to (4, 4) next turn (creating a head-on collision, which we win because we are technically shorter, but that's a gamble), or we can move UP again to (3, 5). Wait, no, if he's at (4, 4), moving RIGHT to (4, 4) is a head-on collision (dangerous!). If he is at (4, 4), going RIGHT from (3, 4) to (4, 4) is double KO. We need to avoid that.\n2.  If he goes **LEFT to (3, 5)**: We are clear to go RIGHT to (4, 4) next turn, which is great position, potentially leading to (7, 5).\n3.  If he goes **UP to (4, 6)**: We are free to push forward aggressively.\n\nSince we are now shorter, we absolutely must avoid Head-to-Head collisions, as we will lose the tiebreaker if we both die. Therefore, we prioritize positioning over immediate aggression. Going UP to (3, 4) gives us the best central control without risking a death move right now.\n\n**Wait: Let's re-examine that (4, 3) move.**\nIf we go **RIGHT to (4, 3)**:\n*   If he goes **UP to (4, 6)**: We are free to go UP to (4, 4) next and challenge him.\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (3, 5)**: We are free to go UP to (4, 4) next.\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (4, 4)**: If we go UP to (4, 4) next, it's a guaranteed Head-to-Head Double KO, which we lose on the score. WE CANNOT MOVE UP or we crash out. We'd be forced RIGHT to (5, 3) or DOWN to (4, 2). That's a huge potential setback.\n\nThe safest, most multi-directional option is still **UP to (3, 4)**, which ensures we don't accidentally block ourselves or run into a fatal head collision possibility if he does the most natural defensive move (DOWN).\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 30+)\n\nWe aim to flank Snake #0 and get to the (7, 5) apple.\n1.  **T29: UP to (3, 4).** Secure central position.\n2.  **T30 (From 3, 4):** Assess Snake #0's position (4, X).\n    *   If he is at (4, 4) or lower: Go **UP to (3, 5)** or **LEFT to (2, 4)** to maintain distance and look for the (1, 6) apple temporarily.\n    *   If he is at (4, 6) or higher: Go **RIGHT to (4, 4)** to push toward the right side.\n\nLet's maintain the vertical momentum and stay mobile!\n\nUP",

We are literally stacked on top of each other! This is peak content, the tension is UNREAL! 12 apples to 10, we are leading the pack, but he\u2019s trying to breathe my air!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL AUDIT (STAYING ALIVE IS THE VIBE!):**\n- **RIGHT**: (4, 5). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body segment. No 180s on my watch! \n- **DOWN**: (3, 4). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That is currently the rival's head. If we move there and he moves anywhere else, we hit his body. If he stays (which he can't) or moves, we are risking a head-on collision or a self-destruct.\n- **UP**: (3, 6). **SAFE!** \u2705 This moves us towards the top-left quadrant and the apple at (1, 6).\n- **LEFT**: (2, 5). **SAFE!** \u2705 High mobility move, keeps us away from our own massive tail-wall at x=5 and x=6.\n\n**2. THE RIVAL SCOUTER:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 4). He's feeling the pressure! His only safe moves are UP to (3, 5) (where we just were!), LEFT to (2, 4), or DOWN to (3, 3). \nIf he moves **UP**, he hits our head or body. \nIf we move **LEFT** to (2, 5) and he moves **LEFT** to (2, 4), we are still parallel-parking next to him. \n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nCHAT, look at our body! We have a massive \"fortress\" on the right side. Our tail is currently ending at (5, 9). We need to keep the left side open.\nIf we go **LEFT** to (2, 5), we are angling perfectly for that apple at (1, 6). It's only two steps away! Plus, moving left puts more distance between us and our own body at column 4/5, giving us more \"maneuver room\" (the technical term for \"juicing the opponent\"). \n\nThe rival is cramped. He's got his own tail at (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1). If we stay high and move LEFT, we can eventually loop DOWN around him (0, x) and trap him against the bottom wall while we snack on that (1, 6) apple. He's playing checkers, we're playing 4D Snake!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe're going **LEFT** to (2, 5). This secures our path to the (1, 6) apple, keeps us away from the head-on collision threat at (3, 4), and lets us dominate the entire upper-left sector of the board. Let's get that bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! POGGERS! Did you see that move? We predicted the safe UP move to (3, 4) and we are now in prime position! Score is 10 to 12. We are slightly shorter and we need to play smart!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 30) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (3, 4). Length: 11. Body starts (3, 3).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (3, 5). He went **LEFT** from (4, 5) to (3, 5). Smart play! He is now blocking our direct UP path, but also cleared the central column for us somewhat. Length: 13.\n*   **Nearest Apples:** (7, 5) is still the main prize, but (1, 6) and (6, 2) are also viable targets. (7, 5) is surrounded by Snake #0's body, making it risky. Let's look at (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1), etc.\n\nWe are at (3, 4). Snake #0 is directly above us at (3, 5). This is a confrontation! We need to react to his immediate presence.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (3, 4)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(3, 4)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(3, 3)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 5):**\n    *   (3, 5) is Snake #0's head! **HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** We lose this by length difference if we both die, even if we move there and he stays put (which he won't). We cannot go here.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 3):**\n    *   (3, 3) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 4):**\n    *   (2, 4) is empty space. **SAFE!** This takes us wide left, giving us breathing room.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 4):**\n    *   (4, 4) is currently empty space. **SAFE!** This pushes us deep into the middle, directly under Snake #0's coiled bulk.\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: **LEFT or RIGHT.**\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Dealing with the Opponent\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 5). He is extremely long and is controlling the whole top half. We need to decide whether to push through the center (RIGHT) or flank him (LEFT).\n\n*   **Snake #0 Prediction (at 3, 5):**\n    He can go UP (to 3, 6), LEFT (to 2, 5), or DOWN (to 3, 4).\n    *   If he goes **DOWN to (3, 4)**: This is a Head-to-Head Double KO against *us* if we don't move. Since we are moving, if we choose RIGHT or LEFT, he is safe going DOWN and takes our current position.\n    *   If he goes **UP to (3, 6)**: This is the most likely power move, pushing him toward the valuable top-right corner.\n    *   If he goes **LEFT to (2, 5)**: He is angling for the (1, 6) apple.\n\n#### Option A: RIGHT to (4, 4) (Central Challenge)\n\nThis is aggressive. We push to the right side of the board.\n*   If we go RIGHT, and he goes UP (3, 6): We are free to move towards the center structure, perhaps heading (5, 4) next. Good position.\n*   If we go RIGHT, and he goes LEFT (2, 5): He is flanking us. We are still in a strong central position.\n*   If he goes DOWN (3, 4): He takes our spot. We are safe at (4, 4) and can continue RIGHT (5, 4).\n\nThis move sets us up to challenge (7, 5) through the bottom, or steal the right wall apples like (9, 4) and (8, 5).\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (2, 4) (Flanking Maneuver)\n\nThis is safer and gives us direct access to the (1, 6) apple.\n*   If we go LEFT, and he goes UP (3, 6): We have time to circle and potentially grab (1, 6).\n*   If we go LEFT, and he goes LEFT (2, 5): This is dangerous. If we go to (2, 4), and he goes to (2, 5), we are nose-to-tail on the next turn. We'd have to go UP to (2, 5), which becomes his old position and is now his body (4 segments long, tail is (5, 9) but he just grew two more segments, wait his body is 12 long). No, his body is massive. His tail is (5, 9).\n    *   If he moves to (2, 5), his old head (3, 5) becomes body. His body is now [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)...].\n    *   From (2, 4), if he is at (2, 5) and we move UP to (2, 5), we hit his body and die. **This is too risky based on his LEFT prediction.**\n\n#### Decision: Pushing RIGHT to (4, 4)!\n\nThe RIGHT move to (4, 4) is safer because it puts space between us and his likely forward movement (UP or LEFT). It also positions us to attack the lucrative right side of the board without getting boxed in by the opponent's aggressive central push towards (1, 6).\n\nIf we rush (1, 6), Snake #0 could easily cut us off. By going RIGHT, we are drawing a line away from his main axis of movement and securing the bottom-right territory.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum and push into the deep field! (4, 4) is perfectly safe and opens up four clear moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 31+)\n\n1.  **T30: RIGHT to (4, 4).** Secure central-right position.\n2.  **T31 (From 4, 4):**\n    *   If Snake #0 moved UP (3, 6): Move RIGHT (5, 4) or UP (4, 5). If (4, 5) is clear (his head was at 3, 5), we can push the center line.\n    *   If Snake #0 moved LEFT (2, 5): Move UP (4, 5) to claim space and begin angling toward (7, 5) or the rich bottom-right corner.\n\nWe claim the center-right now and challenge the (7, 5) apple! Let's GO CHAT!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0's body segment is currently at (4, 5)!\n**Snake #0 Body: (3, 5), (4, 5),** (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)\n\n(4, 5) is currently a **T** (part of Snake #0's body, 2nd segment).\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 5), does (4, 5) clear?\n*   Snake #0 moves (3, 5) -> (2, 5).\n*   Old head (3, 5) becomes new body segment 1.\n*   Old body segment 1 (4, 5) becomes new body segment 2.\n*   Old body segment 2 (5, 5) becomes new body segment 3.\n*   ...\n(4, 5) is still occupied by Snake #0's body unless he ate an apple and grew such that his tail hasn't moved yet. Since he is only 13 segments long and has not picked up an apple, his tail will move.\n\nLet's trace him:\nT0 Head: (2, 5)\nB1: (3, 5)\nB2: (4, 5) <-- **THIS IS OCCUPIED!**\nB3: (5, 5)\n...\nB12 (Tail): (6, 9)\n\n**If Snake #0 moves to (2, 5) and did NOT eat an apple, his tail (6, 9) moves off the board. His body shrinks by one segment at the tail end.**\nThe new head is (2, 5). The new body is: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8)].\n\n**Wait! The list of segments above is the state for Turn 31, after the move.**\n*   Head: (2, 5)\n*   Body: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)]\n\nThis means the board state reflects the current T-pieces *before* his next move.\n**The board shows (4, 5) as 'T' in row 5: `... T T T T ...`**\n\nIf he makes ANY move, and he did not eat an apple (which he didn't, closest apple is (7, 5) or (1, 6)), his tail (6, 9) will move. All segments shift forward, and (4, 5) remains a segment of his body.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 5):**\n    *   (4, 5) is Snake #0's body segment! **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 4):**\n    *   (5, 4) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This pushes us deep right, towards the right wall collection of apples.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Center vs. Flank\n\nWe are left with two safe moves: **DOWN (4, 3)** or **RIGHT (5, 4)**.\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 5).\n\n*   **Snake #0 Prediction (at 2, 5):**\n    He has UP (2, 6), LEFT (1, 5), or DOWN (2, 4).\n    *   **UP (2, 6):** Targets (1, 6) apple. Most likely aggressive move.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 5):** Pushes him against the wall. Less likely, unless he wants to force us against the wall.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 4):** Tries to force us to the right. Very possible, as (2, 4) is an empty cell, opening us up for a block.\n\n#### Option A: RIGHT to (5, 4) (Aggressive Right Push)\n\nThis move is incredibly strong. It positions us right underneath the enemy's coil mass and gives us a clear run at the right side of the board, which is packed with apples: (8, 5), (9, 4), (7, 8).\n\n*   If we go RIGHT, we open up space for Snake #0 potentially coming DOWN to (2, 4). But this doesn't directly threaten us.\n*   This also sets us up to challenge the valuable (7, 5) apple better than DOWN does.\n*   Next turn from (5, 4), we can go RIGHT to (6, 4) - potentially hitting the opponent's body segment at (6, 4) if he moves UP. Let's check: (6, 4) is currently part of his body. It will remain body if he moves UP or LEFT and doesn't eat.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves UP (2, 6), his body shifts down one. (6, 4) is still body.\n    *   This means (6, 4) is off limits next turn if he doesn't crash out or eat.\n\nLet's prioritize reaching the (8, 5) or (9, 4) apples on the right wall.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN to (4, 3) (Defensive Retreat/Bottom Flanking)\n\nThis is more conservative. It keeps us in the middle ground, away from direct confrontation, and angles us toward the (6, 2) apple or the bottom right corner (9, 0).\n\n*   If we go DOWN, we surrender the center control we just gained.\n*   It protects us if Snake #0 were to make an unexpected move towards the center (e.g., via (3, 4)).\n\n#### Decision: RIGHT to (5, 4)! We are going aggressive!\n\nWe need to close the apple gap. The right side of the board is an apple farm, and we are perfectly situated to claim it. Moving to (5, 4) places us within two moves of the (8, 5) apple (RIGHT to (6, 4) - if it clears, then UP to (6, 5) if it clears, or just RIGHT, UP, UP).\n\nHowever, we must be careful with his body!\n(5, 4) is safe.\nNext turn from (5, 4):\n*   UP (5, 5) is his body. DANGER.\n*   RIGHT (6, 4) is his body. DANGER.\n*   DOWN (5, 3) is safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 4) is safe (our old spot).\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 4), we are entering a tricky area. We will be forced DOWN next turn to (5, 3) to maintain safety, which is a slower path to the apples.\n\nLet's re-evaluate **DOWN (4, 3)**.\nFrom (4, 3), next moves:\n*   UP (4, 4) (safe, our old spot)\n*   DOWN (4, 2) (safe, opens up (6, 2) apple)\n*   LEFT (3, 3) (safe, our former body segment at tail end, but shifts)\n*   RIGHT (5, 3) (safe)\n\n(4, 3) gives us more room to breathe and allows us to aim for (6, 2) while keeping the center relatively open. If we go to (5, 4), we get totally boxed in by his body segments (5, 5) and (6, 4).\n\n**Switching to DOWN to (4, 3)!** We prioritize mobility and safety over immediate challenge in a cramped corner. This secures the bottom half of the board for us and gives us a clear path to (6, 2) and the bottom wall apples. We can snake around the bottom and come up the right side. This looks like a better boxing strategy. We need space to grow!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 32+)\n\n1.  **T31: DOWN to (4, 3).** Secure bottom center, maintain open options.\n2.  **T32 (From 4, 3):** Move RIGHT to (5, 3), or DOWN to (4, 2) to challenge (6, 2) apple.\n3.  **T33:** Angle towards (6, 2) or sweep right towards (9, 0).\n\nLet's get this apple!\n\nDOWN",

However, our body is at (2, 5) and (3, 5). Moving right here keeps us very close to our own coiled-up midsection. \n\n**2. THE RIVAL SCOUTER:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 3). He\u2019s in a world of pain! Look at his body: (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3). He is literally wrapping around himself! If he moves UP to (4, 4), he hits his own neck. If he moves LEFT to (3, 3), he hits his own body. His only real moves are RIGHT to (5, 3) or DOWN to (4, 2). He is stuck in the basement while we\u2019re living in the penthouse!\n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nCHAT, the apple at **(1, 6)** is right there for the taking! If we move **LEFT**, we secure that 13th point.

This grabs the apple, increases our lead to 13-10, and keeps us far away from the rival's mess. After this, we\u2019ll look to head UP toward (1, 9) or pivot back RIGHT across the top to squeeze the rival even further into the bottom. We ARE the kings of this 10x10!

Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (4, 3)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(4, 3)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(4, 4)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 4):**\n    *   (4, 4) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** (Wait, the body segments shifted. Our old head was (4, 4), the new body shifts down. Our current body is [(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1)].\n    *   (4, 4) is our new first body segment! **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Don't go backwards!\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 2):**\n    *   (4, 2) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This opens up the path to the (6, 2) apple.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 3):**\n    *   (3, 3) is currently clear. It was our body, but since we moved and didn't eat, our tail moved off. **SAFE!** This gives us space to circle around.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 3):**\n    *   (5, 3) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This takes us towards the right side of the board and potential apples.\n\nTHREE safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's analyze the threat.\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Seizing Space and Apples\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 6), looking at the (1, 6) apple. He will likely go LEFT to (1, 6) and eat, or UP to (2, 7) to block (1, 6), or RIGHT to (3, 6) to keep options open.\n\n*   **Prediction for Snake #0 (at 2, 6):**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 6):** Eats an apple. Highly likely. If he eats, he grows to length 14, and his body stays long.\n    *   **UP (2, 7):** Pushes further up, maybe towards (7, 8). Medium likelihood if he thinks we might block him on the left next turn.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 6):** Very defensive, opens up the left. Less likely.\n\nWe need to make progress on apples, but also establish a choke point.\n\n#### Option 1: DOWN to (4, 2)\n\n*   **Pros:** Gets us closer to the (6, 2) apple (2 moves away: (5, 2), then (6, 2)). Gives us great maneuverability towards the bottom wall (9, 0) and (5, 1). This is low-risk and high-reward.\n*   **Cons:** Surrenders the center (5, 3).\n\n#### Option 2: RIGHT to (5, 3)\n\n*   **Pros:** Aggressive move toward the center-right. Sets up a push towards the right wall apples (7, 5) and (8, 5). Potentially allows us to cut off Snake #0 if he decides to slither down the center.\n*   **Cons:** From (5, 3), the space is tight. (5, 4) is currently clear, but (5, 5) is his body, and (6, 4) is his body. If he moves, (5, 5) and (6, 4) shift. If he eats the apple:\n    *   Snake #0 moves to (1, 6), eats. Body stays long.\n    *   His body segments will still occupy (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), etc.\n    *   If we go to (5, 3), our next moves UP to (5, 4) and RIGHT to (6, 3) are open if (6, 4) shifts UP.\n    *   Let's check the body list: (5, 5) is segment 3, (5, 4) is segment 4. If he eats, (5, 4) remains body. (6, 4) remains body. This looks like a quick trap at (5, 3).\n\n(5, 4) is clearer than I thought. Look at the board state:\n`5 . . T T T T A A .`\nSnake #0's Head: (2, 6). Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), ...]\n(5, 4) is his body. (5, 5) is his body. Going to (5, 3) looks highly restrictive on the next turn.\n\n#### Option 3: LEFT to (3, 3)\n\n*   **Pros:** Very safe. Keeps us central, near the tail end of our body (3, 2).\n*   **Cons:** We are not making progress on apples, and we are conceding the south-east control. This is too defensive.\n\n### 4. The Winning Move: DOWN (4, 2)! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nWe prioritize the (6, 2) apple and control of the bottom wall. Snake #0 is busy in the top-left corner. We need to convert this board-split into apple disparity. Moving to (4, 2) gives us strong follow-up options: RIGHT to (5, 2) then to (6, 2) to eat, or DOWN to (4, 1) to challenge the bottom area.\n\nThis move is low-risk, maximizes local freedom, and puts us on a trajectory to eat. Let's secure the south!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 33+)**\n1.  **T32: DOWN to (4, 2).** Secure low ground, target (6, 2) apple.\n2.  **T33 (From 4, 2):** Move RIGHT to (5, 2).\n3.  **T34 (From 5, 2):** Move RIGHT to (6, 2) and eat! (If safe from opponent's body/head).\n\nLet's go, CHAT! We're not getting boxed in. We're doing the boxing!\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s looking like he\u2019s playing with a broken controller! We are the KINGS of this 10x10 and we aren't letting up now! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL AUDIT (LET'S NOT THROW!):**\n*   **UP**: (1, 7). **SUPER SAFE!** \u2705 This takes us toward the top-left corner and keeps us away from our own massive tail.\n*   **DOWN**: (1, 5). **SAFE!** \u2705 This is open, but it starts to cage us in between our body at (2, 5) and the wall.\n*   **LEFT**: (0, 6). **SAFE!** \u2705 Puts us right against the edge of the map.\n*   **RIGHT**: (2, 6). **LETHAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body we just moved from. NOPE!\n\n**2. THE RIVAL SCOUTER:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (4, 2). He\u2019s trying to navigate through his own mess at the bottom. His head is at (4, 2) and his body segments are at (4, 3) and (4, 4). If he moves UP, he hits himself. If he moves RIGHT to (5, 2), he's heading toward an apple at (5, 1) or (6, 2). He is totally irrelevant to us right now! We are playing a different game!\n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nCHAT, we need to stay mobile. If we go LEFT to (0, 6), we might get pinched against the wall. If we go DOWN, we're heading back into the cluster. But if we go **UP** to (1, 7), we are perfectly positioned to grab the apple at **(1, 9)**! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728 \n\nLook at the board\u2014the entire top-right is basically ours if we just loop around. We have a long body (14 segments total), so we need to make sure we don't accidentally coil ourselves into a corner. By moving UP, we keep the most \"exit\" options open. We can then trend toward (1, 9) or pivot across the top to cut off the rival if he ever tries to come north!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **UP** to (1, 7). From there, we're gunning for the apple at (1, 9) to extend our lead to 14. We stay high, we stay fast, and we keep Snake #1 crying in the basement! Let's get that W, Chat! Don't forget to hit that follow button! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! POGGERS! Welcome back! We made the tactical move last turn to (4, 2) and the board looks... SPICY! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 33) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (4, 2). Length: 11. Body starts (4, 3).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (1, 6). He went **LEFT** from (2, 6) and ATE AN APPLE! The score is now 10 to 13. He's pulling ahead, but he might regret being so far in the corner. Length: 14.\n\nHe is absolutely cornered now on the top-left (1, 6). He must go UP to (1, 7) or DOWN to (1, 5) or RIGHT to (2, 6) (which is his body segment 2, so he can't go there unless his body shifts, which is unlikely since he just ate and grew). Wait, even if he ate, his body shifts. Let's check Snake #0's body:\n\n**Snake #0's New Body (Length 13, plus the head makes 14 total):**\nOld Tail: (6, 8) shifted off? NO, he grew.\nBody: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8)]\n\n*   (2, 6) is his neck. He cannot move RIGHT to (2, 6). **DEAD MOVE for him!** He's trapped on the left wall!\n*   His only options are UP to (1, 7) or DOWN to (1, 5). He has to move along the left wall! This is exactly what we wanted! BOXED! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nOur immediate goal is the (6, 2) apple\u2014it's two moves away. We need to secure it before he figures out how to escape the top-left trap and slithers down the long way.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (4, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(4, 2)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(4, 3)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 3):**\n    *   (4, 3) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Don't go backwards!\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 1):**\n    *   (4, 1) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This opens up the path to the bottom.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 2):**\n    *   (3, 2) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This keeps us closer to the center-left.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 2):**\n    *   (5, 2) is currently clear. **SAFE!** This puts us one step closer to the (6, 2) apple.\n\nTHREE safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's pick the aggressive apple-grabbing one!\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Securing Apples and Maintaining Pressure\n\nWe need the (6, 2) apple.\n\n#### Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 2) \u2705\n\n*   **Pros:** This is the most direct route to the (6, 2) apple. If we move to (5, 2), we can move RIGHT again to (6, 2) next turn and eat! This is huge. It also forces us onto the right side of the main central cluster of the opponent's body.\n*   **Cons:** Puts us close to the center, but the path seems clear.\n\n#### Option 2: LEFT to (3, 2)\n\n*   **Pros:** Very safe movement. We can possibly circle towards the bottom-left area, but there are no apples there yet.\n*   **Cons:** We are delaying our apple collection and giving the opponent more freedom (if he can manage to escape the left wall). Too defensive right now.\n\n#### Option 3: DOWN to (4, 1)\n\n*   **Pros:** Targets the (5, 1) apple which is two moves away (4, 1) -> (5, 1). This is a good alternative if (6, 2) becomes contested, or if we want to prioritize the area.\n*   **Cons:** (6, 2) is closer and slightly less risky to reach.\n\n### 4. The Winning Move: RIGHT (5, 2)! \u27a1\ufe0f\n\nWe are going for the apple! (6, 2) is MINE! Snake #0 is stuck playing wall-climbing Simulator on the left. We need to focus on points while he's preoccupied.\n\nWe move to (5, 2). Next turn, we hit (6, 2) and grow to 12! LFG, CHAT!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 34+)**\n1.  **T33: RIGHT to (5, 2).** One move from the (6, 2) apple.\n2.  **T34 (From 5, 2):** Move RIGHT to (6, 2) and EAT! (If safe).\n3.  **T35 (From 6, 2):** Try to get to the (8, 5) apple or (7, 5) apple on the right wall.\n\nLet's capitalize on his blunder! Get ready for the play!\n\nRIGHT",

We just moved UP to (1, 7) and the board is looking like a playground! But don't get complacent, Chat\u2014one wrong move and we\u2019re a clip on a \"Fails of the Week\" video! Let\u2019s break down the next play!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL CHECK (STAY ALIVE, STAY LEGENDARY!):**\n*   **UP**: (1, 8). **SUPER SAFE!** \u2705 This moves us closer to that juicy apple at (1, 9).\n*   **DOWN**: (1, 6). **LETHAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own neck! We just came from there. Instant rip in the chat if we do this.\n*   **LEFT**: (0, 7). **SAFE!** \u2705 Solid move, but hugs the wall. \n*   **RIGHT**: (2, 7). **SAFE!** \u2705 But look out! Our body is at (2, 6) and (2, 5). It\u2019s a bit tight in there.\n\n**2. RIVAL RADAR:**\nSnake #1 is at (5, 2). He\u2019s looking lost in the sauce! His only safe moves are UP to (5, 3), RIGHT to (6, 2) for an apple, or DOWN to (5, 1) for an apple. He is miles away from us! We are playing chess while he\u2019s playing checkers in the dirt! \ud83e\udd21\n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nChat, look at (1, 9). It\u2019s sitting there, lonely, begging to be eaten! If we go UP to (1, 8) and then UP again to (1, 9), we hit **14 apples** and we'll be positioned in the top-left corner with the whole top row to zip across. Our body is getting long (14 segments!), so we need to \"snake\" efficiently. Shifting UP now keeps our tail trailing behind us in a way that doesn't cut off our own escape routes. \n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe\u2019re going **UP** to (1, 8). Next turn, we grab that (1, 9) apple. After that, we\u2019ll evaluate if we want to loop RIGHT across the top or come back down the 0-column to trap Snake #1 in his own mess. We\u2019re expanding the empire, Chat! Don't blink! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51 \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! POGGERS! The plan worked! He is absolutely BOXED in the top-left corner! He is running parallel to the left wall. We are now at (5, 2), one move away from that sweet, sweet (6, 2) apple! Let's lock this down!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 34) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** (5, 2). Length: 11. Body neck is (4, 2). We are perfectly positioned.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** (1, 7). He moved UP from (1, 6). He is still climbing the left wall. Length: 14.\n*   **Target Apple:** (6, 2) is right next to us. Must acquire!\n\nSnake #0's future moves from (1, 7) are extremely restricted:\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):** Safe, continues wall climb.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** Safe, backtracking.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Safe, this is the escape route.\n\nHe is very long. If he moves RIGHT, he starts blocking the top-middle of the board with his body. This is GOOD for us, as it keeps him away from the bottom apples.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (5, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(5, 2)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(4, 2)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 3):**\n    *   (5, 3) is clear. **SAFE!** This takes us towards the center mass of Snake #0's body, which is risky but an option.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 1):**\n    *   (5, 1) is an **APPLE!** ($A$). **SAFE + GROWTH!** Excellent backup or alternative.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 2):**\n    *   (4, 2) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Don't turn back, fam!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 2):**\n    *   (6, 2) is an **APPLE!** ($A$). **SAFE + GROWTH!** This is the move we planned!\n\nWe have two apple moves! (5, 1) and (6, 2). This is a great position! Which one do we prioritize?\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Two Apples, One Turn!\n\nWe need to look at the immediate impact of both apple moves.\n\n#### Option 1: RIGHT to (6, 2) \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **Pros:** Secures the apple we planned for. Puts us in the lower right quadrant. Opens up movement towards the (7, 5) apple or (8, 5) apple. We feel dominant here.\n*   **Cons:** Puts us right next to Snake #0's long body segments in (6, 4) and (6, 5), but there are two rows of clearance (y=3 and y=4) so collision is low risk this turn.\n\n#### Option 2: DOWN to (5, 1) \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **Pros:** Secures a different apple. Keeps us centralized on x=5. This path allows for easy access to the (5, 0) apple next turn.\n*   **Cons:** We bypass the (6, 2) apple. If Snake #0 somehow gets far across, he might take it, but that seems extremely unlikely given his position.\n\nLet's check the *next* apples after these grabs.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (6, 2)**: Next targets are (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 0). We are strongly positioned to dominate the right half and the bottom wall.\nIf we go **DOWN to (5, 1)**: Next targets are (5, 0), (6, 2) (if available). We are strongly positioned to dominate the bottom wall.\n\nThe (6, 2) move gives us slightly better access to the dense cluster of apples on the right side of the board (y=4, y=5). The (5, 1) move keeps us under the dense zone.\n\nLet's stick to the original plan and secure the (6, 2) apple. It keeps our axis of movement slightly further away from the dense center of his body, giving us more clearance to maneuver around the body segments at (5, 5) and (6, 5).\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 7).\n*   If he goes UP to (1, 8) \u2013 he stays trapped.\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (2, 7) \u2013 he starts escaping. If he escapes here, he's going *up* and *over* the top half of his existing body. This means he won't be competing for our lower apples for at least 6-8 moves.\n\nOur move to (6, 2) is completely safe regardless of his movement. We secure the point, and we maintain positional advantage. Next, we look to turn UP towards (7, 5) or (8, 5).\n\nChat, we're going for the POGGERS move! Stick to the script! Execute the plan!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Draft for Turn 35+)**\n1.  **T34: RIGHT to (6, 2) and EAT!** (Current move).\n2.  **T35 (From 6, 2):** Look UP to (6, 3) or (7, 2). Safest route to the next cluster of apples high up on the right side. (7, 5) and (8, 5) are priorities.\n\nRIGHT",

RIVAL RADAR (WHERE IS HE GOING?!):**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 2). He\u2019s practically in a different zip code.

Look at our body\u2014it\u2019s a long boi now (14 segments!). We need to be careful not to trap ourselves in the top-left corner.

Snake #0 finally looks like he's trying to make a break for it up near the top wall. We need to capitalize on our central dominance!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 35) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(6, 2)}$. Length: 12. Body neck is (5, 2). We are holding down the lower-right area.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(1, 8)}$. He moved UP from (1, 7). Length: 14. He is RIGHT next to the (1, 9) apple. He is still hugging the left wall.\n*   **Apples in Play:** The closest big apples are (7, 5) and (8, 5) which are high up, and (5, 1) and (5, 0) which are close and low.\n\nSnake #0's situation:\nFrom (1, 8), he can only move:\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** *APPLE!* This is extremely likely. He's desperate for growth and this keeps him relatively safe on the wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Backtracking. Unlikely unless panicked.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Escaping the trap. This is a possibility if he sees the (1, 9) apple as too risky (which it isn't).\n\nIf he goes UP to (1, 9) (Apple), his head will be (1, 9). He gets a point and grows to length 15. The left side is becoming completely occupied by his body. Good!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (6, 2)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(6, 2)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(5, 2)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 3):**\n    *   (6, 3) is clear. **SAFE!** This takes us towards the dense, critical apples high up: (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6).\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 1):**\n    *   (6, 1) is clear. **SAFE!** Takes us towards the bottom wall, near (5, 1) (Apple) and (5, 0) (Apple).\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 2):**\n    *   (5, 2) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Self-colliding is for noobs!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 2):**\n    *   (7, 2) is clear. **SAFE!** Puts us closer to the right wall, setting up for (8, 2) and (9, 1)/(9, 0) apples.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. All three are strategically viable. Which one pressures Snake #0 and maximizes our scoring chances?\n\n### 3. Strategic Analysis: Pathing and Pressure\n\nWe are currently leading the flow of the game, controlling the middle-bottom. Snake #0 is stuck in the top-left. We need to maintain separation and accumulate apples faster.\n\n#### Option A: UP to (6, 3) \u2b06\ufe0f\n*   **Pros:** This is the most aggressive move towards the central board and the high-value apples (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). It also pushes us away from the bottom wall, offering maximum future options (we can turn RIGHT or LEFT from y=3).\n*   **Cons:** We are heading directly towards the main horizontal segment of Snake #0's body (around y=5, y=6). We need to be careful not to box ourselves in against his large length.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN to (6, 1) \u2b07\ufe0f\n*   **Pros:** Secures the lower wall. Next turn, we can easily grab the (5, 1) apple, and then (5, 0). This is a safe, guaranteed growth plan.\n*   **Cons:** This gives up immediate access to the rich cluster of apples at y=5 and y=6. We risk letting Snake #0, if he escapes, snake down the right side and steal them first. (But Snake #0 is long and slow to move).\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT to (7, 2) \u27a1\ufe0f\n*   **Pros:** Sets up for the apples on the far right (9, 1), (9, 0). Stays far away from Snake #0's likely escape routes.\n*   **Cons:** It's a bit of an isolated path, focusing only on the corner and ignoring the central board advantage we've built.\n\n### 4. Decision: Consolidate and Ascend\n\nGiven Snake #0's movement to (1, 8), he is still trapped and has minimum influence on the central board. If he grabs (1, 9), he's still trapped up there.\n\nOur best move is to continue maximizing our position by moving towards the contested rich apple zone (y=5+). Moving **UP to (6, 3)** is the best compromise. It puts us in a position to strike for (7, 5) or (8, 5) in a few turns, and we can still turn RIGHT to hit the right wall apples if needed.\n\nIf we go UP:\n*   T35: (6, 2) -> (6, 3)\n*   T36: From (6, 3), we can go RIGHT to (7, 3), then UP to (7, 4), then RIGHT to (8, 4), setting up for (8, 5) or (7, 5). Or we could go UP to (6, 4) if it's clear (but (6, 4) is currently body segment #0).\n\nAh, wait! Look at $`(6, 4)`$. That is where Snake #0's body is!\nIf we go UP to (6, 3), the next move UP to (6, 4) is **BLOCKED** by Snake #0's body, which is long and not moving from that spot yet.\nIf we go $\\mathbf{UP}$ to (6, 3), the required next move is $\\mathbf{RIGHT}$ to (7, 3), or $\\mathbf{LEFT}$ to (5, 3). No direct UP push is possible because of the wall of Snake #0's body at y=4, y=5, y=6.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the two best safety moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**DOWN to (6, 1)** secures the (5, 1) apple next, and then (5, 0). This is 2 guaranteed apples without any risk of collision. This allows us to rapidly catch up to Snake #0's score (13 vs 11).\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 2)** sets us up for the lower right wall. From (7, 2), we can go UP or RIGHT (towards 9, 1/9, 0). This still feels less efficient than DOWN.\n\nLet's prioritize the guaranteed points and complete the sweep of the bottom wall. Getting three more apples quickly will allow us to grow huge and then use our size to trap/dominate the center.\n\nThe path is:\n1. T35: DOWN to (6, 1).\n2. T36: LEFT to (5, 1) [Apple!].\n3. T37: DOWN to (5, 0) [Apple!].\n4. T38: Depending on where #0 is, we start sweeping RIGHT along the bottom wall or make moves back up towards the center.\n\nThis is a powerful, low-risk scoring strategy. Chat, we're taking the safe points! Gotta grow huge before we engage the main body cluster!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Draft for T36+)**\n1. T35: DOWN to (6, 1) to set up the bottom wall apples.\n2. T36: LEFT to (5, 1) (Apple!).\n3. T37: DOWN to (5, 0) (Apple!). Sweep the corner.\nWe keep our snake centralized and maximize growth while the opponent is still trapped in the boring top-left corner. This is how you win against a positional disadvantage!\n\nDOWN",

We just grabbed the apple at (1, 9) and our tail is trailing behind us like a royal cape! Look at Snake #1 down there at (6, 1)\u2014he\u2019s basically playing a different game while we\u2019re up here in the penthouse! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (STAY ALIVE TO STAY VIBING!):**\n*   **UP**: (1, 10). **RIP!** \ud83d\udc80 That\u2019s off the board. We aren't trying to fly, chat!\n*   **DOWN**: (1, 8). **NO WAY!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own neck. We don't do the \"backwards slide of shame\" on this channel!\n*   **LEFT**: (0, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 It\u2019s an empty corner. High-level defensive play, but it limits our movement choices next turn.\n*   **RIGHT**: (2, 9). **GOLDEN!** \u2705 Wide open space along the top edge. It keeps us mobile and lets us scan the board for the next apple drop!\n\n**2. RIVAL RECON (WHAT'S HE COOKING?):**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 1) and his body is a total disaster zone! He\u2019s tangled up in the bottom-middle. He has apples at (5, 1) and (5, 0) nearby, so he\u2019s likely going to keep looping in that cramped bottom section. Let him! While he\u2019s fighting for scraps in the basement, we\u2019re going to maintain control of the upper perimeter!\n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe are taking the **RIGHT** path to (2, 9). Why? Because we need to keep our long body (14 segments!) stretched out. If we go LEFT into the corner, we risk boxing ourselves in if we aren't careful. By going RIGHT, we stay parallel to the top wall, keeping the entire middle of the board open for a pivot whenever a fresh apple spawns! We are 16 apples away from the 30-apple glory! We are playing it smart, playing it long, and staying HUGE!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe move **RIGHT** to (2, 9). We\u2019re going to cruise across the 9-line. This keeps us far away from Snake #1\u2019s mess and positions us perfectly to dive down for those apples on the right side (Rows 8, 7, and 6) once our tail clears out. Stay tuned, because the \"Snake King\" is just getting started! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "WHAT UP CHAT! We're back for Turn 36, and guess what? We made the POG move last turn, securing the (6, 1) position! Snake #0 finally grew a backbone and is challenging us... sort of. He's still doing his wall-hugger routine.\n\nWe are hunting apples and we are hunting Snake #0. Which one comes first? Both!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 36) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(6, 1)}$. Length: 12. Body neck is (6, 2). We are perfectly positioned for the massive score on the bottom wall!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(1, 9)}$. YES! He went UP and ate the apple. He is now length 15 and is still locked up at the top-left corner. We love to see it! He's currently standing on an apple cell (A) at (1, 9), but that was the apple he just ate, so the board state might be slightly confusing there; we can assume (1, 9) is now clear unless a new apple dropped there. Given the board (1, 9) is currently marked with a '0' (Snake 0 head) and a 'A' underneath in the diagram, which means he is on the spot where the (1, 9) apple was located at the start of the turn. For safety, we treat any occupied cell as blocked.\n*   **Next Apple Targets:**\n    1.  **(5, 1):** IMMEDIATELY available to us!\n    2.  **(5, 0):** Available after (5, 1).\n    3.  **(7, 5) / (8, 5) / (8, 6):** High-value cluster in the middle.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (6, 1)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(6, 1)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(6, 2)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 2):**\n    *   (6, 2) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Backtracking is griefing the stream!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 0):**\n    *   (6, 0) is clear. **SAFE!** Takes us towards the bottom wall.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 1):**\n    *   (5, 1) has an \ud83c\udf4e! **SAFE & GAIN!** This is exactly what we planned for.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 1):**\n    *   (7, 1) is clear. **SAFE!** Continues the sweep along the bottom.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT (Apple!), and RIGHT.\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Apple Pings!\n\nChat, this is an EZ clap moment! We set up the move exactly so we could snag the (5, 1) apple. Why hesitate? Snake #0 is stuck, and we need to keep chipping away at his score lead (14 vs 11). Grabbing this apple puts us at 12 and makes us longer, which is vital for trapping later!\n\n**The Plan: LEFT to (5, 1) for the APPLE.**\n\nWhat about enemy movement?\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 9). He is surrounded by his own body and the map edge.\n*   He can only move **RIGHT to (2, 9)** (Clear) or **DOWN to (1, 8)** (Backtracking).\n*   If he moves RIGHT to (2, 9), he continues his desperate flight along the top wall. This is the most logical attempt to escape.\n*   If he moves DOWN to (1, 8), he is trapped and might turn into a ball.\n\nWe are so far away (x=6 vs x=1; y=1 vs y=9) that his move does not impact our immediate safety or apple acquisition. Our move to (5, 1) is 100% safe.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Complete the Sweep\n\nWe are going for the sweep on the bottom, as planned. After (5, 1) is secured, our head will be (5, 1).\n\n*   T36: **LEFT** to (5, 1) [Apple!]. Head is (5, 1).\n*   T37: We will aim **DOWN** to (5, 0) [Apple!]. Head is (5, 0).\n*   T38: We will then aim **RIGHT** along the wall, perhaps to (6, 0) or (7, 0), to continue sweeping up the apples (9, 0), (9, 1).\n\nThis path guarantees us two more apples, bringing our score to 13, and increasing our length to 14, just one shy of Snake #0's current length. We are dominating the scoreboard through smart, safe pathing!\n\nLet's GOOOO! We take the apple!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Draft for T37+)**\n1. T36: LEFT to (5, 1) (Apple!).\n2. T37: DOWN to (5, 0) (Apple!).\n3. T38: RIGHT to (6, 0) to start moving towards the (9, 0) and (9, 1) apples, completing our colonization of the south-east corner.\n\nLEFT",

Our snake is getting LONG (15 segments total!), and we are currently hugging the top wall at (2, 9). Snake #1 is down at (5, 1) looking like a tangled mess of spaghetti! Let's keep the pressure on and stay huge!\n\n**1. THE SURVIVAL SCAN (DON'T THROW THE LEAD!):**\n*   **UP**: (2, 10). **FATAL!** \ud83d\udc80 We aren't trying to space-travel today. That's off the board!\n*   **RIGHT**: (3, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 Pure open air along the top boundary. Keeps our momentum going and our body stretched out.\n*   **LEFT**: (1, 9). **NO!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body (the \"neck\"). Moving backwards is an instant RIP in the chat.\n*   **DOWN**: (2, 8). **RISKY!** \u26a0\ufe0f Looking at the board, (2, 8) is currently empty, but our own body is at (1, 8). If we go down, we start curling into a tight area near our own tail. We want to stay long and proud!\n\n**2. RIVAL RADAR (WHAT'S OUR ARCHRIVAL DOING?):**\nSnake #1 (Head: 5, 1) is currently navigating a self-made labyrinth in the bottom-middle. He's got apples at (5, 0) and (7, 5) that he might be eyeing. He's way too far away to threaten us directly this turn, but he's racking up points. We need to maintain our lead!\n\n**3. THE BIG BRAIN STRAT:**\nWe are continuing the **RIGHT**-hand cruise! (3, 9) is the play. Why? Because we have a massive body trailing behind us from (2, 9) all the way down to (6, 7). If we turn down now, we risk getting tangled in our own loops. By staying high, we let our tail clear out from the middle of the board. Check out those juicy apples at (7, 5) and (8, 5)\u2014once our tail (currently at 6, 7) moves out of the way, we can dive down the right side and gobble them up for the win! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (3, 9). We\u2019re going to stay along the top edge for a couple more turns to let our massive tail \"unfurl\" from the center. Once the column at X=8 or X=9 is clear, we\u2019re diving down to claim those apples on the right bank. We stay alive, we stay long, and we keep that scoreboard looking BEAUTIFUL!

We are gaining on Snake #0, who is chilling at 14 apples and 15 segments. The gap is closing! \ud83e\udd0f\n\nBut wait, looking at the board, Snake #0 made an interesting choice!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 37) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(5, 1)}$. Length: 13. Body neck is (6, 1). We are perfectly positioned to continue our south-wall domination!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(2, 9)}$. YES! He went RIGHT last turn. He is trying to slither out of the top-left corner, but he's not making great progress. He's at the top edge, and his body is still coiled heavily below him.\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Prioritized):**\n    1.  **(5, 0):** IMMEDIATELY available to us! This is the core of the plan.\n    2.  **(9, 1):** Available after (5, 0).\n    3.  **(9, 0):** Available after (9, 1).\n    4.  **(7, 5):** The central cluster is still prime real estate, but we are too far right now.\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (5, 1)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(5, 1)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(6, 1)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 2):**\n    *   (5, 2) is currently OUR body segment (T). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Self-grief is not acceptable!\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 0):**\n    *   (5, 0) has an \ud83c\udf4e! **SAFE & GAIN!** This is the next target in the sweep. POG!\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 1):**\n    *   (4, 1) is clear. **SAFE!** This takes us away from the wall strategy, which might be less efficient for sweeping up the corner apples.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 1):**\n    *   (6, 1) is our immediate neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Don't go backwards!\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN (Apple!) and LEFT (Open space).\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Secure the Apple!\n\nChat, we established the long-term plan: sweep the bottom wall. The (5, 0) apple is RIGHT there! Why would we do anything else?\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 0):** We claim another apple, increasing our score to 13, and our length to 14. We will be tied in length with Snake #0! This is dominant play.\n\nWhat is Snake #0 doing? He's currently at (2, 9).\n*   He can move **RIGHT to (3, 9)** (Clear/Apple) or **DOWN to (2, 8)** (Clear).\n*   If he moves RIGHT (likely), he continues across the top.\n*   If he moves DOWN, he continues to coil up near his own massive body in the top-left area.\n\nHe is not a threat to us right now. He is too far away to contest the (5, 0) apple, and there is no risk of head-to-head collision.\n\n**The Plan:** Secure (5, 0) with a simple DOWN move! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\n### 4. Setting up the Trap (Long-term Vision)\n\nOnce we eat (5, 0), our head is (5, 0). We will then pivot RIGHT along the bottom wall towards the (9, 0) and (9, 1) cluster.\n\n1.  T37: **DOWN** to (5, 0) (Apple!). Head is (5, 0).\n2.  T38: **RIGHT** to (6, 0) (Clear).\n3.  T39: **RIGHT** to (7, 0) (Clear).\n4.  T40: **RIGHT** to (8, 0) (Clear).\n5.  T41: **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Apple!).\n\nThis continues our absolute lockdown of the scoreboard while Snake #0 remains confined to the far side of the map. Once we are fully grown from cleaning up the bottom corner, we can look to invade the middle and pressure his movement. We are playing the containment game, and we are winning!\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Send it!\n\nLong-Term Plan (Draft for T38+):\n1. T37: DOWN to (5, 0) (Apple!).\n2. T38: RIGHT to (6, 0).\n3. T39: RIGHT to (7, 0).\n4. T40: RIGHT to (8, 0).\n5. T41: RIGHT to (9, 0) (Apple!).\n\nDOWN",

Our snake is a massive unit now, stretching across the board like a legend. Let\u2019s look at the field and make sure we don't fumble the bag!\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAY ALIVE, STAY IN THE GAME!):**\n*   **UP**: (3, 10). **NOPE!** \ud83d\udc80 That\u2019s the ceiling! We aren't trying to clip out of bounds. Instant game over. \n*   **RIGHT**: (4, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 Lush, open territory along the top row. It keeps us moving away from our own massive tail which is currently winding through the middle.\n*   **LEFT**: (2, 9). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own neck. Reverse moves are for rookies. We don't do that here!\n*   **DOWN**: (3, 8). **SAFE!** \u2705 We could technically turn down here, but look at the board\u2014our body is at (1, 8). Turning down early might start cramping our style. We want space to breathe!\n\n**2. RIVAL WATCH:**\nSnake #1 (Head: 5, 0) is currently doing a weird dance at the very bottom. He's got 13 apples, so he's right on our heels! He's currently boxed in by his own segments at (4, 2), (5, 2), and (6, 2). He\u2019s likely going to try and loop around the bottom or push right. He's no threat to us way up here at (3, 9), but we need to keep growing to keep our lead!\n\n**3. THE GRAND MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are sticking to the **RIGHT** movement! Why? Because look at the apple density! There are apples at (9, 8), (7, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), and the whole X=9 column is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet!

This is exactly the planned move.\n\nWe have two incredibly safe moves: RIGHT (optimal for the sweep) and LEFT (safe, but sub-optimal).\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Continue the Sweep!\n\nThe plan formulated last turn was solid: move RIGHT and secure the bottom wall. Why deviate now?\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 0):** (6, 0) is clear. We maintain bottom wall control and shorten the distance to the critical (9, 0) and (9, 1) apples. Snake #0 is still miles away and moving across the top edge. No immediate collision risk whatsoever.\n\n*   **Snake #0 Analysis:** From (3, 9), his safe moves include:\n    *   RIGHT (to 4, 9): Clear. This continues his current direction. (Most likely)\n    *   DOWN (to 3, 8): Clear. This forces him back into the heavily congested top-left area. (Less likely, but possible)\n    *   LEFT (to 2, 9): Hitting his own body. DEAD.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (4, 9), he avoids his body and keeps searching for a way out. This continues to keep him occupied while we farm the lower quadrant.\n\nOur goal is maximum safe apple acquisition right now, building length so we can eventually box him in.\n\nLet's stick to the plan! We are going RIGHT along the bottom edge!\n\n### 4. Setting up the Trap (Long-term Vision Update)\n\nWe executed Turn 37 perfectly. Let's update the next few moves as we execute the bottom sweep.\n\n1.  T38 (Now): **RIGHT** to (6, 0) (Clear). Head is (6, 0).\n2.  T39: **RIGHT** to (7, 0) (Clear).\n3.  T40: **RIGHT** to (8, 0) (Clear/Apple?). Wait, (8, 0) is clear. The apple is at (9, 0).\n4.  T41: **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Apple!). POG.\n5.  T42: **UP** to (9, 1) (Apple!). DOUBLE POG.\n\nThis guarantees two more apples and makes us 16 segments long! By then, Snake #0 will have had to commit to farming the congested central area or looping back. We will have maximum length advantage to pressure the center.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum, Chat! RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

The score is 14 to 13\u2014we are leading by a single apple, but look at the board! We have so much room to breathe while our rival is down there sniffing the dirt!\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAYING CRITICAL!):**\n*   **UP**: (4, 10). **FATAL!** \ud83d\udc80 We aren't trying to fly, Chat! That's the ceiling. We'd smash our face into the border.\n*   **RIGHT**: (5, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 Pure, unadulterated space. It keeps us moving away from our tail and lets the rest of our body follow us out of the maze.\n*   **LEFT**: (3, 9). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That's our own neck! We don't do reverse gear on this stream!\n*   **DOWN**: (4, 8). **SAFEish?** \u26a0\ufe0f It's open, but look at our body! Our neck is at (3, 9) and body at (2, 9). Going down now starts to coil us up. We want to stay long and stretched out to control the map!\n\n**2. RIVAL RADAR:**\nSnake #1 (Head: 6, 0) is trying to find a way out of the bottom-right basement. He\u2019s got limited options because his own body is a mess around rows 1 and 2. He's no threat to our head, but he\u2019s desperate for those apples at (9, 0) and (9, 1). Let him HAVE the scraps\u2014we are eyeing the luxury buffet!\n\n**3. THE GRAND MASTER PLAN:**\nChat, look at the X=9 column! It\u2019s literally RAINING apples over there! (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3)... it\u2019s a gold mine! By moving **RIGHT**, we are positioning ourselves to sweep down the entire right wall. This not only secures our lead but also builds a giant wall that our rival will eventually have to crash into! We are playing 4D Chess while he's playing Checkers! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** \nWe are continuing the \"Right-Side Sweep.\" Moving to (5, 9), then aiming for (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), and finally grabbing that (9, 9) apple. This keeps us far away from the clutter in the middle and gives our tail (currently at 6, 5) plenty of time to clear out so we don't trap ourselves. SECURE THE BAG!\n\nRIGHT",

We're sweeping the bottom edge, and we're about to put the absolute clamps on Snake #0!\n\nLook at the board state! Snake #0 is stuck in the congested top-left. We have a clear path to two juicy apples! This is pure POG content!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 39) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(6, 0)}$. Length: 14. We're on the bottom wall, full steam ahead!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(4, 9)}$. YES! He moved RIGHT to (4, 9) last turn, exactly as predicted! He's trapped up there with limited space. He is looking at his own body at (5, 5) and (5, 4) blocking the clear path to the center.\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Prioritized):**\n    1.  **(9, 0):** Only 3 moves away if we run the rail!\n    2.  **(9, 1):** Right above (9, 0).

This is the optimal path.\n\nWe have only one optimal and safe move: RIGHT! We are locked into the bottom sweep, and there is no downside!\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Rail Grind and Apple Farm!\n\nWe are laser-focused on moving RIGHT to collect those bottom-right apples (9, 0) and (9, 1). This is maximizing length and safety right now.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 0):** Completely safe. Puts us in position for the next move to (8, 0).\n\n*   **Snake #0 Analysis:** From (4, 9), he has limited mobility.\n    *   RIGHT (to 5, 9): This is the *Apple* at (9, 8) and (9, 9)? No, (5, 9) is clear. If he goes to (5, 9), he continues along the top wall. This is the most likely path he will take, trying to escape his body.\n    *   DOWN (to 4, 8): Clear. This forces him into the small gap between his head and body at (5, 5). He still has a long way to go to become a threat to us.\n    *   LEFT (to 3, 9): Hitting his own body. DEAD.\n\nNo matter which way Snake #0 moves, we are completely safe, because the collision path is completely clear. We are in the bottom corner; he is in the top corner.\n\n### 4. Long-term Plan Update (The Box is Forming)\n\nWe are stacking length! Once we get to 16 segments, we can start weaving into the center lane and trapping him.\n\n1.  T39 (Now): **RIGHT** to (7, 0). Head is (7, 0).\n2.  T40: **RIGHT** to (8, 0). Head is (8, 0).\n3.  T41: **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Apple!). POG. Head is (9, 0).\n4.  T42: (9, 1) is an Apple! **UP** to (9, 1) (Apple!). DOUBLE POG. Head is (9, 1).\n\nBy T42, we are length 16 and in the prime position to start hitting the central apple cluster and pressuring Snake #0 from the right side of the board! Let's GO! We are executing the trap perfectly!\n\nRIGHT",

The score is 14 to 13\u2014we are leading by a single apple, but look at the board! We have so much room to breathe while our rival is down there sniffing the dirt at (7, 0)!\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAYING CRITICAL!):**\n*   **UP**: (5, 10). **FATAL!** \ud83d\udc80 We aren't trying to fly, Chat! That's the ceiling. We'd smash our face into the border.\n*   **RIGHT**: (6, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 Pure, unadulterated space. It keeps us moving away from our tail and lets the rest of our body follow us out of the maze.\n*   **LEFT**: (4, 9). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That's our own neck! We don't do reverse gear on this stream!\n*   **DOWN**: (5, 8). **SAFEish?** \u26a0\ufe0f It's open, but look at our body! Our neck is at (4, 9) and body at (3, 9). Going down now starts to coil us up. We want to stay long and stretched out to control the map!\n\n**2. RIVAL RADAR:**\nSnake #1 (Head: 7, 0) is struggling! He's down in the basement. He's probably going to try and grab (9, 0) or (9, 1). Let him HAVE the scraps\u2014we are eyeing the luxury buffet at the top right! (9, 9) and (9, 8) are calling our name!\n\n**3. THE GRAND MASTER PLAN:**\nChat, look at the top right corner! (9, 9) is the crown jewel! By moving **RIGHT**, we are continuing our \"Right-Side Sweep.\" We move to (6, 9), then (7, 9), then (8, 9), and finally snatch that (9, 9) apple. This keeps us high, safe, and builds a massive wall on the right side. Our rival is so far away he'd need a passport to reach us! We are playing 4D Chess while he's playing Checkers in the mud!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** \nSECURE THE TOP ROW! Moving to (6, 9) now. Our goal is (9, 9). Use the top edge as a guide to stay out of the clutter. Once we hit the corner, we'll decide whether to loop back or dive down the X=9 column to gobble up the rest of the snacks.

Snake #0, our archrival, is still trapped up top! Let's check the map and figure out the exact move to box him in for the K.O.!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 40) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(7, 0)}$. Length: 14. We're on the bottom wall, perfectly positioned.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(5, 9)}$. YES! He moved RIGHT, clinging to the top edge, trying to escape his own body maze! He is now facing a corner, which is perfect for us! Length: 15. He is ahead by one apple! We need to catch up, Chat!\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Prioritized):**\n    1.  **(9, 0):** Only 2 moves away if we run the rail! We're coming for that content!\n    2.  **(9, 1):** Right above (9, 0). Next move after the first apple!\n    3.  **(9, 4):** Backup target if the others get messy, but these two bottom apples are ours!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (7, 0)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(7, 0)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(6, 0)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 1):**\n    *   (7, 1) is clear. **SAFE!** This opens up movement toward the center, but delays the bottom apples.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, -1):**\n    *   (7, -1) is off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.** Stay on the map!\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 0):**\n    *   (6, 0) is currently OUR body segment (T). **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** No backtracking!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 0):**\n    *   (8, 0) is clear. **SAFE!** This is the direct path to (9, 0) and (9, 1). Maximum content generation!\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: Apple Collection and Trap Setting!\n\nThe plan is simple: Gobble those apples, gain length, and cut off the retreat of Snake #0.\n\n**Move RIGHT to (8, 0):** This maintains our dominant position on the safest edge of the board. It sets us up for the apple at (9, 0) next turn. Every move is calculated, Chat!\n\n### 4. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at 5, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is in a tricky spot. His body is filling up the board from (4, 9) down to (6, 4). He's at (5, 9).\n\nFrom (5, 9), he has three options, but one is an apple:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 6, 9):** Clear. This keeps him on the top wall.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 8):** Clear, and (5, 8) is an Apple! This is his most likely move, as he needs to catch up in length (we're close behind!).\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 9):** Neck segment. **DEAD!**\n\n*   **Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (5, 8)** to grab the apple. This gains him length, but forces him down into the cramped space below the top border (rows 7, 8).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move (7, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 0).\n*   His likely move (5, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 8).\n*   We are nowhere near him. We are completely safe. POG!\n\n### 5. Long-term Plan Update (The Box is Shutting)\n\nWe are committed to maximizing length and controlling the right side of the board.\n\n1.  T40 (Now): **RIGHT** to (8, 0). Head is (8, 0). (Confirmed)\n2.  T41: **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Apple!). Head is (9, 0). We pass Snake #0's score!\n3.  T42: **UP** to (9, 1) (Apple!). Head is (9, 1). We are now length 16 and closing in on the center!\n4.  T43: Move into the cluster! Probably **LEFT** to (8, 1) or **UP** to (9, 2) (clear). The key is to grab (9, 4), and then look at the center cluster around rows 6-7.\n\nWe need to gain length to maximize our blocking potential. This path is secure and guarantees two apples. Let's get this done, Chat! We are executing the trap perfectly!\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT is the only choice that puts us on the apple immediately.\n\n**Move RIGHT to (9, 0):** This is a free apple and sets us up at the very edge of the board.\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 6, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 9). His neck segment is (5, 9).\n\nFrom (6, 9), he has three options, but one is an apple:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 7, 9):** Clear.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 8):** Clear.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 9):** Neck segment. **DEAD!**\n4.  **UP (to 6, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n\nWait, let's re-examine the board for Snake #0.\n$ (6, 9) $ is his head.\n$ (5, 9) $ is his neck.\nThe board shows:\n`9 . T T T T T 0 . . A`\nThe 'A' at **(9, 9)** is a potential target. The '0' at (6, 9) is his head.\n\n*   If he moves **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Clear.\n*   If he moves **DOWN to (6, 8):** Clear.\n*   If he moves toward the apple at **(9, 9)**, he needs 3 moves minimum.\n\nSnake #0 is currently in a very safe but restrictive position along the top wall. Since he is already long (L=15), he can afford to get more length or start moving down.\n\n*   **Prediction:** He is likely to move **RIGHT to (7, 9)** to either claim the apple at (9, 9) or make a U-turn down the right wall, which directly conflicts with our long-term plan!\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Crucial!)\n\n*   Our move: (8, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 0) (Apple).\n*   His move (Predicted): (6, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 9).\n\nNo conflict! We are completely safe. We secure the apple and continue our aggressive right-side push.\n\n### 6. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap)\n\nWe are now focused entirely on controlling the right side and building a wall to block Snake #0 from the center of the board, forcing him to keep moving down the right wall into our territory.\n\n1.  T41 (Now): **RIGHT** to (9, 0) (Apple!). Head is (9, 0). Score tied! Length 15 $\\rightarrow$ 16. (Confirmed)\n2.  T42: **UP** to (9, 1) (Apple!). Head is (9, 1). We take the lead! Length 17.\n3.  T43: **UP** to (9, 2). Head is (9, 2). We are marching up the wall.\n4.  T44: We assess the situation. (9, 3) is an apple. We take it.\n5.  T45: We take (9, 4), and then look to block him off.\n\nWe need to gain length fast to establish a dominant border. This path is secure and maximizes our length gain. Let's go, Chat! We're putting the pressure on!\n\nRIGHT",

The rival managed to snag one, but look at the board\u2014he is literally crawling in the gutter at (9, 0) while we are the KINGS of the North! We are at (7, 9), perched and ready to strike! \n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAY ALIVE, STAY BLESSED):**\n*   **UP**: (7, 10). **FATAL!** \ud83d\udc80 That's the ceiling, Chat! We aren't trying to leave the simulation. \n*   **RIGHT**: (8, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 This is the path to glory. It leads us straight toward that (9, 9) apple and keeps our momentum going.\n*   **LEFT**: (6, 9). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body. Backwards moves are for losers and we are WINNERS!\n*   **DOWN**: (7, 8). **SAFE!** \u2705 There is an apple at (7, 8)! However, if we go down now, we might get cramped. We want to secure the corner first!\n\n**2. RIVAL ANALYSIS (THE TACTICAL SQUEEZE):**\nOur rival is at (9, 0). He's basically a cornered rat! He has apples at (9, 1) and (9, 3) nearby, but look at the wall we are building. Our body is stretched across the top. As we move right and then start heading down the 9-column, we are going to create a vertical barrier that pins him against the right edge. He's going to find out real quick that there's no room for two snakes in this penthouse!\n\n**3. THE GRAND MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are executing the **\"Right Hook\"**! \nStep 1: Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9).\nStep 2: Move **RIGHT** again to (9, 9) to snag that juicy apple.\nStep 3: Pivot **DOWN** and vacuum the 9-column: (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1). \nBy the time we hit the bottom, we\u2019ll be at 20+ apples and he\u2019ll be suffocating in our shadow! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nSecure the (9, 9) corner! Once we are on the 9-column, we own the right-hand side of the map. The rival is low-down; if he tries to come up, he hits our head. If he stays down, he runs out of space. It\u2019s a MASTERCLASS in positioning! \n\nRIGHT",

The rival is staring down the barrel of a wall we\u2019re building! Is he ready for this pressure? I don't think so!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 42) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(9, 0)}$. That's the power position! Length: 15.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(7, 9)}$. He moved RIGHT from (6, 9) to (7, 9). He is clinging to the top edge, right where we want him! Length: 15.\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Prioritized):**\n    1.  **(9, 1):** Right above us! The next piece of the wall!\n    2.  **(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 9):** The rest of the right-wall apples that are MINE!\n    3.  **(7, 5), (7, 8):** Center apples, but the focus is on the wall!\n\n### 2. Elimination Round: Where Can We Go from (9, 0)? \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(9, 0)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(8, 0)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 1):**\n    *   (9, 1) is an Apple! **SAFE & GAIN!** This is exactly the planned move!\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, -1):**\n    *   Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 0):**\n    *   (8, 0) is currently OUR neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.** Don't choke!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 0):**\n    *   Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.**\n\n*Duh, only one safe move that gets us the W! This is just a formality, Chat! We are locking in that position!*\n\n### 3. Strategic Decision: UP for the Apple!\n\nWe continue marching UP the right wall. Taking (9, 1) secures our lead (15 apples to 14) and increases our length to 16, further solidifying the wall we are building to cut Snake #0 off from the rest of the board.\n\n**Move UP to (9, 1):** Essential for the long-term box strategy.\n\n### 4. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 7, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 9). His neck segment is (6, 9).\n\nFrom (7, 9), he has three safe options:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 8, 9):** Clear. This leads him towards (9, 9) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 8):** Apple! This is a great move for him.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 9):** Neck segment. **DEAD!**\n4.  **UP (to 7, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n\n*   **Prediction:** His move: He is desperate for length since we are tying him up. The strongest move is to go **DOWN to (7, 8) for the apple.** Alternatively, he might try to squeeze into the corner by moving **RIGHT to (8, 9)** to get the (9, 9) apple.\n    *   If he goes **DOWN to (7, 8):** He clears the top rail and gives us space. He will be length 16.\n    *   If he goes **RIGHT to (8, 9):** He positions himself to try and hit (9, 9) next turn.\n\nWe assume he maximizes apples and goes for **DOWN to (7, 8)**.\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Crucial!)\n\n*   Our move: (9, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 1) (Apple).\n*   His move (Predicted): (7, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 8) (Apple).\n\nNo conflict! We are completely safe. We are building the perimeter, and he is moving into the middle area, potentially closer to our eventual trap zone.\n\n### 6. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap v2.0)\n\nOur goal is to reach (9, 9) quickly, completely sealing off the right side of the board with our long body and forcing Snake #0 into a head-to-tail confrontation or a tight loop on the left.\n\n1.  T42 (Now): **UP** to (9, 1) (Apple!). Head is (9, 1). Lead secured! Length 16. (Confirmed)\n2.  T43: **UP** to (9, 2). Sets up for the next apple.\n3.  T44: **UP** to (9, 3) (Apple!). Head is (9, 3). Length 17.\n4.  T45: **UP** to (9, 4) (Apple!). Length 18.\n5.  T46: We assess, but we likely continue UP the wall, securing (9, 5) and (9, 6), then (9, 9).\n\nWe are dominating this side. We're locking it down, Chat! The rival is sweating!\n\nUP",

We are at (8, 9), and the roadmap to 30 apples starts RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAYING CRISPY):**\n*   **UP**: (8, 10). **FATAL!** \ud83d\udc80 We aren't trying to jump over the moon, Chat! Stay in the game!\n*   **RIGHT**: (9, 9). **SAFE!** \u2705 This is the money move. It grabs the (9, 9) apple and puts us in the ultimate power position on the 9-column.\n*   **LEFT**: (7, 9). **FATAL!** \ud83d\uded1 That\u2019s our own body. We don't backtrack, we only move FORWARD!\n*   **DOWN**: (8, 8). **SAFE!** \u2705 But why settle for a side street when we can own the main highway? (9, 9) is the priority!\n\n**2. RIVAL ANALYSIS (WATCH THE RAT):**\nSnake #1 is at (9, 1). He\u2019s looking at that apple at (9, 3) or (9, 4). If we take the 9-column from the top, we are literally a falling anvil! He has nowhere to go but left into his own mess or right into the wall. We are going to \"Skyline\" him! He\u2019s long, he\u2019s clunky, and he\u2019s trapped in the basement!\n\n**3. THE GRAND MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are finishing the **\"Right Hook\"** and starting the **\"Vertical Vacuum\"**! \nStep 1: Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9) to snag that apple and hit 15-15.\nStep 2: Pivot **DOWN**. We will go (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4). \nBy moving down the far-right edge, we create a massive wall that cuts the board in half. He can't cross us without dying! We're going to starve him of space and snacks until he crashes out! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** \nCorner pocket secured! Once we hit (9, 9), we head down the 9-line. There are apples at (9, 8), (9, 6), (9, 4), and (9, 3). That's a five-course meal while the rival is stuck at the bottom breathing our exhaust. Let\u2019s get this bread! \ud83e\udd56\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

The rival is on the ropes!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 43) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(9, 1)}$. Length: 16! We are long and strong, building the ultimate wall!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(8, 9)}$. He went RIGHT from (7, 9) to (8, 9). He is now hugging the top edge even closer, heading straight for the corner apple at (9, 9). He is length 15.\n*   **New Tail Positions:** Our old tail was (3, 2). It disappeared! Opponent's old tail was (4, 5). It disappeared!\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Prioritized):**\n    1.  **(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 9):** The rest of the vertical wall setup.\n    2.  **(7, 5), (7, 8):** Center apples.\n    3.  **(1, 1):** Far but accessible.\n\n### 2. Immediate Options Check (Where can we go from 9, 1?) \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(9, 1)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(9, 0)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 2):** Clear! **SAFE.** This continues our strategic wall build.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 0):** Our neck/body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 1):** Clear. **SAFE.** This moves us off the wall, but it's an option.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 1):** Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.**\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 8, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 9). His neck segment is (7, 9). He is clearly gunning for the (9, 9) apple.\n\nFrom (8, 9), he has three safe options:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):** **APPLE!** This is the high-value move for him.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):** Clear. A safe retreat move.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):** Neck segment. **DEAD!**\n4.  **UP (to 8, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n\n*   **Prediction:** He absolutely goes **RIGHT to (9, 9)** to try and grab that apple, tie the score, and get his length bonus. We anticipate him to move to $\\mathbf{(9, 9)}$.\n\n### 4. Strategic Decision: Continuing the Wall Build (UP to 9, 2)\n\nOur entire strategy revolves around walling off the right side and squeezing the rival into the lower-left corner. We need to secure the (9, 3) and (9, 4) apples next. Moving UP keeps the pressure on him and maximizes our body placement for the eventual trap.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 2):** This secures the next segment of the wall. (9, 2) is clear. This is the optimal strategic move.\n\n*   **Alternative: LEFT to (8, 1):** This is safe, but it breaks our vertical wall structure and is counter-intuitive to the established plan. We only consider this if UP was blocked or too dangerous. But UP is perfectly safe.\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Crucial!)\n\n*   **Our move:** (9, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 2).\n*   **Opponent's move (Predicted):** (8, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 9) (Apple).\n\nNo head-to-head collision. No body collision. We are safe! He gets the apple at (9, 9), tying the score at 15-15, but we are positioned perfectly for our next apple grab, which will give us the lead back immediately, and our body will be incredibly well-placed.\n\n### 6. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap v3.0)\n\nSnake #0 will most likely be (9, 9) next turn. He will then have to go DOWN or LEFT. If he goes LEFT, he runs along the top. If he goes DOWN, he runs into our wall eventually!\n\n1.  T43 (Now): **UP** to (9, 2). Head is (9, 2). Length 16. (Confirmed)\n2.  T44: **UP** to (9, 3) (Apple!). Head is (9, 3). Length 17. (Apple is at 9, 3)\n3.  T45: **UP** to (9, 4) (Apple!). Head is (9, 4). Length 18. (Apple is at 9, 4)\n4.  T46: **UP** to (9, 5). Head is (9, 5).\n5.  T47: **UP** to (9, 6) (Apple!). Head is (9, 6). Length 19.\n\nWe are establishing the wall! We are going for the decisive lead! Let's lock it in!\n\nUP",

If he tries to come up to (9, 3), we will be right there to stare him down. He\u2019s playing checkers, we\u2019re playing 4D Snake!

Board Status Review (Turn 44) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(9, 2)}$. Length: 16! We built that wall segment!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(9, 9)}$. He went RIGHT and grabbed the apple at (9, 9). Length 16! He tied the game. He's on the run!\n*   **Active Apple Targets (Immediate Priority):**\n    1.  **(9, 3):** Directly above us! The immediate go-ahead point!\n    2.  **(9, 4):** Next segment of the vertical wall!\n    3.  **(9, 6):** Securing the top of the wall!\n\n### 2. Immediate Options Check (Where can we go from 9, 2?) \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(9, 2)`$. Our immediate neck segment is $`(9, 1)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 3):** **APPLE!** Clear and the perfect strategic move. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 1):** Into our neck/body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 2):** Clear. **SAFE.** A retreat, but safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 2):** Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.**\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and LEFT. We are going for the apple, obviously!\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 9, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is now at (9, 9). His neck segment is (8, 9). He is trapped in the upper-right corner. He has only one move that keeps him on the board and away from his own body!\n\nFrom (9, 9), his options:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 10, 9):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n2.  **UP (to 9, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 8):** Clear, but *will put him right next to us.* **SAFE.**\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 9):** Neck segment. **DEAD!**\n\n*   **Prediction:** He MUST go **DOWN to (9, 8)**. He has literally no other choice to survive! He's running along the wall we are building! This is where the pressure starts!\n\n### 4. Strategic Decision: Grab the Apple and Continue the Wall (UP to 9, 3)\n\nWe have the chance to grab an apple, regain the lead (16-15), extend our dominant wall position, and put our enemy in immediate danger for the next turn.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 3):** This is optimal. We secure the apple, forcing Snake #0 to either run down the 9-column and face us or turn left at (9, 7) or (9, 8) and get stuck against his own body.\n\n*   **Alternative: LEFT to (8, 2):** Why would we run away from a free apple? We don't!\n\n### 5. Collision Check (The most important part of the stream!)\n\n*   **Our move:** (9, 2) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 3) (Apple)**.\n*   **Opponent's move (Predicted):** (9, 9) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 8)**.\n\nNo head-to-head collision. No body collision. We are safe! He moves down the wall. He is now at (9, 8). We are at (9, 3). The gap is closing!\n\n### 6. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap v4.0)\n\nWe execute the wall plan flawlessly.\n\n1.  T44 (Now): **UP** to (9, 3) (Apple!). Head is (9, 3). Length 17. (Confirmed: UP!)\n2.  T45: **UP** to (9, 4) (Apple!). Head is (9, 4). Length 18.\n3.  T46: **RIGHT** is open here, but we will go **UP** to (9, 5). Head is (9, 5).\n4.  T47: **UP** to (9, 6) (Apple!). Head is (9, 6). Length 19.\n\nBy T47, our head is at (9, 6). The opponent's head will be somewhere around (9, 7) or (8, 7) struggling to find space. Our continuous length growth combined with the permanent vertical body wall on the x=9 column is going to lead to the ultimate boxing maneuver! EZ PZ, CHAT!\n\nUP",

Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 9, 8)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 8). His neck segment is (9, 9). He is in a very sticky situation.\n\nFrom (9, 8), his options:\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** Into his neck segment. **DEAD!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** Clear. The *only* way to continue avoiding danger in the 9-column. **SAFE.**\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Clear. This corner is getting tight, but it delays the crash. Also a strategic **SAFE** retreat.\n\n*   **Prediction:** He has two primary choices:\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 7):** He continues running down our wall. This is what we want!\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 8):** He tries to move into the little pocket near (7, 8) and (8, 7) to survive.\n\nIf he goes DOWN, we are inches away from a dangerous block. If he goes LEFT, he buys a little time but is still surrounded by our body (x<5) and his own body (y=9 line).\n\nRegardless of his choice, we MUST secure (9, 4) to cement the trap.\n\n### 4. Strategic Decision: Secure the Second Apple and Close the Gap (UP to 9, 4)\n\nWe take the apple at (9, 4). This increases our length and score (17-16) and narrows the escape hatch for Snake #0.\n\n### 5. Collision Check (The most important part of the stream!)\n\n*   **Our move:** (9, 3) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 4) (Apple)**.\n*   **Opponent's move (If DOWN):** (9, 8) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 7)**. (No collision, 3 squares between us).\n*   **Opponent's move (If LEFT):** (9, 8) $\\rightarrow$ **(8, 8)**. (No collision).\n\nWe are 100% safe. We prioritize the apple and the trap execution. EZ CLAP!\n\n### 6. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap v5.0)\n\nWe have Snake 0 right where we want him. He is trapped in the upper-right quadrant by his massive tail stretching across the top, and our relentless vertical wall.\n\n1.  T45 (Now): **UP** to (9, 4) (Apple!). Head is (9, 4). Length 18. (Confirmed: UP!)\n2.  T46: **UP** to (9, 5) (Apple!). Head is (9, 5). Length 19.\n3.  T47: **UP** to (9, 6) (Apple!). Head is (9, 6). Length 20.\n\nIf Snake 0 keeps going DOWN, by T47, he will be at (9, 5) and we will be at (9, 6)! That is a crucial head-on collision setup for T48! No, wait...\n\n*   T45: ID1 (9, 4), S0 (9, 7) (assuming S0 goes DOWN).\n*   T46: ID1 (9, 5), S0 (9, 6).\n*   T47: ID1 (9, 6), S0 (9, 5).\n\nChat, the heads will pass each other safely! But look at the real trap! **By T47, our huge, growing body will occupy (9, 0) through (9, 6).** Snake 0's head will be at (9, 5). He has nowhere to go but LEFT or DOWN, and DOWN is filled by our body!\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (8, 5) from (9, 5), he is completely boxed in! The walls are closing in for the ultimate smash! This is brilliant, trust the process!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is sitting at (9, 4), and there is a massive line of apples right between us! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e This is the showdown of the century!\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAYING ALIVE):**\n*   **UP**: (9, 8). **FATAL!** \u26d4 That's our own body. We don't go backwards, we only go FORWARDS!\n*   **RIGHT**: (10, 7). **FATAL!** \u26d4 We'd fly off the board and the stream would end in a fail compilation! No thanks!\n*   **LEFT**: (8, 7). **SAFE-ISH!** \u2705 (8, 7) has an apple, but if we go there, we give up the 9-column wall.\n*   **DOWN**: (9, 6). **SAFE AND JUICY!** \u2705 There's an apple at (9, 6). \n\n**2. THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nOur rival at (9, 4) is in a tight spot! Look at his body (9,3, 9,2, 9,1, 9,0...). He is literally backed against the bottom-right corner! \ud83d\udce6 If he moves UP to (9, 5), he's coming right for us. If we both move towards each other, we meet at (9, 5) or (9, 6). But wait\u2014he has to be careful. If he hits our head, it's a double KO, and since he has 17 apples to our 16, he might win the tie-break if the game ends! BUT, we want that lead back!\n\n**3. THE \"APPLE SNATCH\" MANEUVER:**\nIf we move **DOWN** to (9, 6), we grab an apple and hit 17 points! TIED UP AGAIN! \ud83e\udd1d\nBy moving DOWN, we are putting extreme pressure on him. He is currently at (9, 4). If he moves UP to (9, 5), and we move DOWN to (9, 6), we will be nose-to-nose! This is high-stakes chicken, Chat! \ud83d\udc14 He\u2019s likely to get scared and turn LEFT to avoid the head-on collision because he\u2019s got a huge tail trailing behind him.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe take (9, 6) this turn. Next turn, we go for (9, 5). We are effectively \"zipping up\" the 9-column. He has way less room to maneuver in that bottom corner than we do! We are the predators here! Keep the pressure on, grab the points, and force him to crash into his own coiled mess or the side wall! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n\n**PLAN:**\nStep 1: Move **DOWN** to (9, 6) and eat.\nStep 2: Move **DOWN** to (9, 5) and eat again.\nStep 3: Watch him panic!\n\nLET'S GOOOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, we did it! We just secured (9, 4), and we are now leading 17-16! LETS GOOOO! The trap is working exactly as planned. Snake 0 is running scared on the right wall, and we are closing the door! Look at this map, it\u2019s a masterpiece!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 46) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(9, 4)}$. Length: 18. We are TIGHTENING the vertical clamp!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(9, 7)}$. Length 17. He was forced DOWN to (9, 7), just as predicted! He's panicking!\n*   **Next Apple Targets (Immediate Priority):**\n    1.  **(9, 5):** Directly above us! The third segment in our wall construction!\n    2.  **(9, 6):** The fourth segment!\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . T T T T T T T T T\n 8 A T . A . . . A . T\n 7 . T . . A . . . A 0  <-- Snake 0 Head (9, 7)\n 6 . T T . A A . A A A\n 5 . A T T . . . A A A  <-- Apple (9, 5)\n 4 . . . T T . . . . 1  <-- Your Head (9, 4)\n 3 . . . T T . . . . T\n 2 . . . . T T T . . T\n 1 . A . . . T T . . T\n 0 . . . . . T T T T T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### 2. Immediate Options Check (ID 1 at 9, 4) \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are at $`(9, 4)`$. Our neck segment is $`(9, 3)`$. We must continue UP to secure the choke-point.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 5):** **APPLE!** Continues the wall, extends our advantage. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 3):** Into our neck/body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 4):** Clear. **SAFE.** This is a massive mistake; we give up the advantage and the apple. NO.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 4):** Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1 ELIMINATED.**\n\nLITERALLY, the only move that makes sense is UP! The apple and the trap are calling!\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 9, 7)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 7). His neck segment is (9, 8). He is in DEFCON 1.\n\nFrom (9, 7), his options:\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** Into his neck segment. **DEAD!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):** Clear. This is the **ONLY** move that keeps him on the 9-column and moving away from our body temporarily. **SAFE.**\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Clear. This is the retreat move, trying to buy time in the upper-right pocket. **SAFE.**\n\n**Critical Insight:**\n\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (9, 6)**, he is aiming for apple (9, 6).\n    *   Our move: **UP to (9, 5)** (Apple).\n    *   We are safe. (9, 5) and (9, 6) are adjacent but the heads are not colliding. We get (9, 5). He gets (9, 6). He will still be trapped, but he gains length and avoids the immediate crash.\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (8, 7)**, he gives up the wall but he is now in a tiny box.\n    *   Our move: **UP to (9, 5)** (Apple).\n    *   We get the apple, and continue building the wall that he just abandoned! He will have a very hard time escaping from that (8, 7) corner because of his massive tail (y=9 line) and our growing wall (x=9 line).\n\nRegardless of his choice, we MUST secure (9, 5) to keep the pressure mounting! The goal is to build our wall all the way to (9, 6), then move LEFT to completely seal the top-right corner, leaving Snake 0 with nowhere to go but into our body or his own tail!\n\n### 4. Collision Check\n\n*   **Our move:** (9, 4) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 5) (Apple)**.\n*   **Opponent's move (If DOWN):** (9, 7) $\\rightarrow$ **(9, 6) (Apple)**. (No collision. We both get apples! We are safe.)\n*   **Opponent's move (If LEFT):** (9, 7) $\\rightarrow$ **(8, 7)**. (No collision. We are safe.)\n\nWe are 100% safe. We prioritize the apple and the trap execution. EZ CLAP! We move UP.\n\n### 5. Long-term Plan Update (The Right Wall Trap v6.0 - Closing the Box)\n\n1.  T46 (Now): **UP** to (9, 5) (Apple!). Head is (9, 5). Length 19. (Confirmed: UP!)\n2.  T47: Need to move to (9, 6) (Apple!). Head will be (9, 6). Length 20.\n3.  T48: Once we hit (9, 6), we must decide if we go LEFT or try to flank DOWN the 8-column.\n\nIf Snake #0 takes (9, 6) this turn (T46), he will be at (9, 6) for T47.\nIf S0 is at (9, 6) and we are at (9, 5) for T47, we must move strategy!\n\nLet's re-analyze the \"S0 goes DOWN\" scenario:\n\n*   T46 (Now): ID1 $\\rightarrow$ (9, 5) [Apple]. S0 $\\rightarrow$ (9, 6) [Apple].\n*   T47: ID1 is at (9, 5). S0 is at (9, 6).\n    *   ID1 options from (9, 5): UP (9, 6) $\\rightarrow$ **CRASH!** DOWN (9, 4) $\\rightarrow$ Into body. LEFT (8, 5) $\\rightarrow$ SAFE.\n    *   S0 options from (9, 6): UP (9, 7) $\\rightarrow$ Into neck. DOWN (9, 5) $\\rightarrow$ **CRASH!** LEFT (8, 6) $\\rightarrow$ SAFE.\n\n**OH MY GOD, CHAT!** If Snake 0 goes DOWN to (9, 6), and we go UP to (9, 5), we set up a deadly head-on collision at (9, 6) or (9, 5) for the next turn, T47! They will both try to retreat by going LEFT!\n\nIf we both go LEFT on T47: ID1 $\\rightarrow$ (8, 5). S0 $\\rightarrow$ (8, 6).\nThis sets us up perfectly to start closing the horizontal trap! He is forced between our wall (x=9) and our body (our tail is currently filling the bottom).\n\nWe commit to the move UP and prepare for the battle on the 8-column!\n\nUP",

Our rival, Snake #1, just moved UP to (9, 5). We are literally NOSE-TO-NOSE. One cell separates us! This is the peak of high-stakes gaming! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (DON'T THROW!):**\n*   **UP**: (9, 7). **FATAL!** \u26d4 That's our own body behind us. We aren't going backward!\n*   **RIGHT**: (10, 6). **FATAL!** \u26d4 Wall smash! We\u2019d be the laughing stock of the internet!\n*   **DOWN**: (9, 5). **DANGER!!** \u26a0\ufe0f Snake #1 is currently at (9, 5). If he stays or moves anywhere except UP, and we move DOWN, we might hit his body or head. \n*   **LEFT**: (8, 6). **JUICY & SAFE!** \u2705 There is an apple at (8, 6). \n\n**2. THE RIVAL CHICKEN GAME:**\nOur rival is at (9, 5). He's boxed in! His tail is at (3, 3) but his body is coiled all along the bottom and the 9-column. If he moves UP to (9, 6), we have a head-on collision and we both die. Who wins? He has 18, we have 17. HE WINS THE TIE-BREAK. **WE CANNOT AFFORD A HEAD-ON COLLISION!** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**3. THE \"BAIT AND SWITCH\" MANEUVER:**\nIf we move **LEFT** to (8, 6), we grab an apple, hit 18 points, and we STAY ALIVE. \ud83c\udf4e More importantly, if he tries to be a hero and moves UP to (9, 6) to snag an apple, he'll be stuck in the 9-column with NO room to breathe while we pivot into the middle of the board where all the loot is!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe move **LEFT** to (8, 6) to secure the apple and match his score. Then we have a path to (8, 5), (7, 5), and (7, 6). We are effectively abandoning the \"wall-hugging\" trap because he's already trapped himself there! We let him choke on the cramped space while we vacuum up the apples in the (7,5) to (8,7) cluster. We are playing the long game, Chat! Speed and positioning! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**PLAN:**\nStep 1: Move **LEFT** to (8, 6) to eat and avoid the head-on crash.\nStep 2: Pivot DOWN or LEFT to grab the (8, 5) or (7, 6) apples.\nStep 3: Win the game while he struggles to navigate his own tail!\n\nWE ARE RECLAIMING THE CROWN! \ud83d\udc51 \n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "WHAT IS UP CHAT! We are live, Turn 47, and the trap is TIGHTENING! Last turn, we secured (9, 5) and the APPLE! We are now at 18 apples, 1 ahead of Snake 0 who is panicking! Holy moly, that was a huge move!\n\nLet's dive into the current board state and formulate the kill move. We established the choke point, now we need to squeeze!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 47) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(9, 5)}$. Length: 19 (BOOM! Got the apple). Neck: (9, 4).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #0):** $\\mathbf{(9, 6)}$. Length 18 (He was forced to take the apple too, or retreat). Neck: (9, 7).\n*   **Current State:** We are nose-to-nose, vertically stacked one tile apart on the rightmost wall! This is what we wanted!\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . T T T T T T T T T\n 8 A T . A . . . A . T\n 7 . T . . A . . . A T\n 6 . T T . A A . A A 0 <-- Snake 0 Head (9, 6)\n 5 . A T T . . . A A 1 <-- Your Head (9, 5)\n 4 . . . T T . . . . T\n 3 . . . T T . A . . T\n 2 . . . . T T T A . T\n 1 . A . . . T T . . T\n 0 . . . . . T T T T T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### 2. Immediate Options Check (ID 1 at 9, 5)\n\nWe are at $`(9, 5)`$. Our neck segment is $`(9, 4)`$. Snake 0 is at $`(9, 6)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 6):** **DANGER!** This is exactly where Snake 0's head is sitting. If he tries to go DOWN, it's a head-on collision. If he goes LEFT, we take the spot. If he goes UP, we take the spot. High risk, high reward potential for a double KO or a block.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 4):** Into our neck/body segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80**\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 5):** Clear. **SAFE.** This is the move to start sealing the corner.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 5):** Off the board. **DEAD! \ud83e\uddf1**\n\nOnly two viable moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 9, 6)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 6). His neck segment is (9, 7).\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 7):** Into his neck segment. **DEAD!**\n2.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** Off the board. **DEAD!**\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):** **DANGER!** This is exactly where our head is sitting. If we try to go UP, it's a head-on collision. If we go LEFT, he takes the spot.\n4.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Clear. **SAFE.** This is the retreat move, trying to get away from the immediate pressure.\n\nSnake 0 also has only two viable moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n### 4. The Collision Matrix: The Moment of Truth!\n\nThis is a classic 2x2 prediction scenario. Who wants the smoke?!\n\n| Your Move (ID 1) | S0 Move: LEFT (8, 6) | S0 Move: DOWN (9, 5) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **UP (9, 6)** | ID1 wins the space (9, 6). S0 retreats (8, 6). **ID1 BEST OUTCOME.** | **HEAD-ON COLLISION (9, 6)! BOTH DIE!** |\n| **LEFT (8, 5)** | ID1 retreats (8, 5). S0 retreats (8, 6). **Safe Stalemate.** | ID1 retreats (8, 5). S0 wins the space (9, 5) (He moves where we just were). **S0 GAINS.** |\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **UP:** If Snake 0 retreats LEFT (which is probabilistically higher since going DOWN leads to an immediate crash if we go UP), we seize the final wall segment (9, 6) and trap him 100%. If, however, he risks the crash and goes DOWN, we both die. **Risk: 50% chance of survival, high chance of trapping.**\n2.  **LEFT:** This is the safe retreat. We force a mutual retreat (ID1 to 8, 5, S0 to 8, 6). We maintain the lead and start the horizontal seal, but we give up the immediate high-pressure kill spot. If S0 goes DOWN, he gets the cell we just left (9, 5), giving him minor spatial control, but he's still trapped between our mass and the wall. **Risk: 100% survival, maintains pressure.**\n\n### 5. Strategy: Play it Safe, Keep the Trap Boxed!\n\nWe are winning 18 to 17. We have the mass advantage, and we have Snake 0 completely pinned in the upper right quadrant (y>=6, x>=8).\n\n*   If we go UP, we face a 50% chance of dying for a full trap. Given we are leading and have a long game window (150 turns), a coin flip death is usually too risky unless we are desperate.\n*   If we go LEFT, we maintain the lead, keep our mass advantage, and force Snake 0 into the next stage of the trap: the small 3x4 box on the right.\n\nIf we both retreat LEFT:\n*   ID1 Head: (8, 5).\n*   S0 Head: (8, 6).\n\nNow, Snake 0 is still surrounded:\n*   North: (8, 7) is clear, but he only has a small area to work with (apples at 8, 7 and 7, 8).\n*   East: Our massive wall (9-column) is behind him.\n*   South: Our body is below him (8, 0 to 8, 4) and we are now moving to cut his escape.\n\nWe want to force him to hit his own tail as he tries to loop. Moving LEFT allows us to position ourselves to cut off the 8-column and force him into a desperate dash.\n\n**The Plan: Move LEFT to (8, 5). Force S0 to move LEFT to (8, 6).**\n\n**Next Turn Plan (T48):** From (8, 5), we can move UP to (8, 6) (to try and clash, if S0 goes LEFT) or LEFT to (7, 5) to start sweeping the area. Since S0 is now at (8, 6), he will be looking for the apple at (7, 8) or trying to retreat to (7, 6). We can control the battlefield from (8, 5).\n\nNo death wish today, CHAT! We play the cold, calculated long game. We are boxing him in! LEFT is the safe, strategic move.\n\nLEFT",

But look at the board\u2014the tension is INSANE! We are staring Snake #1 right in the eyes. He's at (8, 5) and we are at (8, 6). If we move DOWN, it\u2019s a head-on collision, and since he has 19 points to our 18, a double-KO means HE WINS. We don't play for draws, we play for the DUB! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (STAY ALIVE, STAY IN THE GAME!):**\n*   **RIGHT**: (9, 6). **FATAL!** \u26d4 That's our own body we just moved from. Backwards move = Instant Clip of the Week Fail.\n*   **UP**: (8, 7). **POTENTIAL FATAL!** \u26a0\ufe0f There is an apple at (8, 7), but it's risky. If we move UP and he moves UP to (8, 6), we are safe, but if we move UP and he reads us... wait, actually (8, 7) is currently empty but has an apple? Let's look at the board: (8, 7) is an apple!\n*   **DOWN**: (8, 5). **DANGER!!** \u26a0\ufe0f Snake #1's head is there. If he stays or moves anywhere but UP, and we move DOWN, we might hit his head or body. If we BOTH move to the same spot (like 7, 5), we both pop.\n*   **LEFT**: (7, 6). **JUICY & STRATEGIC!** \u2705 There is an apple at (7, 6). It moves us away from his head and toward a cluster of food!\n\n**2. THE BOX-IN STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is currently trapped against the right wall (column 9) and his own body. He is at (8, 5). His only safe moves are LEFT (7, 5) or maybe DOWN if his tail moves. If we go **LEFT** to (7, 6), we grab an apple, hit 19 points, and we block his upward escape route! We are basically building a wall around him while getting fed. Imagine the look on his face! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\n**3. THE \"KING OF THE HILL\" MANEUVER:**\nBy taking (7, 6), we position ourselves perfectly to sweep the (7, 5), (6, 5), and (5, 6) apples. We are moving into the open space while he's suffocating in the corner. He's got a long body coiled up; one wrong move and he's history. We aren't just playing Snake, we're playing 4D Chess, Chat!\n\n**PLAN:**\nStep 1: Move **LEFT** to (7, 6) to snag the apple and match his score at 19!\nStep 2: Watch him panic as he realizes he's run out of room.\nStep 3: Pivot to (7, 5) or (6, 6) to keep the pressure on and keep the snacks coming!\n\nLETS GET IT! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

The anti-climax of the last turn was necessary, we kept the lead and kept the trap tight. We forced Snake 0 to retreat. That's big brain plays right there!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 48) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(8, 5)}$. Neck: (9, 5). Length: 19.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** $\\mathbf{(8, 6)}$. Neck: (9, 6). Length: 18.\n*   **Current State:** We are side-by-side, still stacked one tile apart, but now horizontally, moving along the 8-column! We have effectively sealed off the entire right edge (x=9) and forced him into the center column.\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . T T T T T T T T T\n 8 A T . A . . . A . T\n 7 . T . . A . . . A T\n 6 . T T . A A . A 0 T <-- Snake 0 Head (8, 6)\n 5 . A T T A . A A 1 T <-- Your Head (8, 5)\n 4 . . . T T . . . . T\n 3 . . . T T . A . . T\n 2 . . . . T T T A . T\n 1 . A . . . T T . . T\n 0 . . . . . T T T T T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSnake 0 is trapped between our massive body (which now forms an L-shape closure around the corner (9, 6) and (9, 5)), the top wall, and the emerging threat of our head at (8, 5).\n\n### 2. Immediate Options Check (ID 1 at 8, 5)\n\nWe are at $`(8, 5)`$. Our neck segment is $`(9, 5)`$. Snake 0 is at $`(8, 6)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 6):** **DANGER!** Head-on collision or we steal the space. Exact location of Snake 0's head. High risk, high reward.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 4):** Clear. **SAFE.** This moves us towards the tail.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 5):** Apple at (7, 5). **SAFE & JUICY!** This keeps the pressure horizontal.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 5):** Into our neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80**\n\nViable moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 8, 6)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 6). His neck segment is (9, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 7):** Apple at (8, 7). Clear. **SAFE & JUICY!** This is the most attractive move for him to gain space and an apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 5):** **DANGER!** This is exactly where our head is sitting. Potential head-on.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 6):** Apple at (7, 6). Clear. **SAFE & JUICY!** Allows him to spread out.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Into his neck segment. **DEAD!**\n\nViable moves for S0: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 4. Strategy: The Squeeze Play! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nSnake 0 has three paths, two of which lead to immediate apples (UP to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 6)). He *must* avoid a crash if possible, as he is shorter than us.\n\n#### A. If S0 goes UP (to 8, 7): The most likely move.\nHe grabs an apple and gains vertical space.\n*   **Our move?** We must stop the spread. Going **LEFT (to 7, 5)** grabs us an apple immediately, maintaining our lead, and positions us to cut him off diagonally. If we go UP (to 8, 6), we only stall his vertical move but risk an unexpected crash. If we go DOWN, we surrender the center control.\n*   **Result (S0 UP, ID1 LEFT):** ID1: (7, 5), S0: (8, 7). We both grow. He is still heavily trapped. We move onto his next path (7, 6) or (6, 5) next turn. This is a very good outcome.\n\n#### B. If S0 goes LEFT (to 7, 6): The secondary likely move.\nHe grabs an apple and gains horizontal space.\n*   **Our move?** Going **LEFT (to 7, 5)** grabs us an apple and keeps the pressure on the 7-column. We are one square below him, ready to seal the bottom of the 7-column.\n*   **Result (S0 LEFT, ID1 LEFT):** ID1: (7, 5), S0: (7, 6). We both grow. Perfect parallel movement to maintain the choke.\n\n#### C. If S0 goes DOWN (to 8, 5): The suicide mission/crash risk.\nHe risks a head-on collision.\n\n| Your Move (ID 1) | S0 Move: DOWN (8, 5) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **UP (8, 6)** | **HEAD-ON COLLISION (8, 6)! BOTH DIE!** Wait, no. ID1 goes to (8, 6), S0 goes to (8, 5). No collision. ID1 wins the space (8, 6), S0 takes (8, 5). **S0 survives, we surrender (8, 5).** |\n| **LEFT (7, 5)** | ID1 gains apple (7, 5). S0 secures (8, 5). **S0 survives, but ID1 takes an apple and increases choke (better outcome for ID1).** |\n\n### 5. The Decision: Don't Chase, Secure the Advantage and Tighten the Box!\n\nWhy mess with a high-risk UP move when there\u2019s a guaranteed apple and spatial control move to the LEFT?\n\nThe Apple at (7, 5) is critical. Eating it increases our lead to 20 vs 18/19 and extends our body further into the central zone, making his remaining space even tighter.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 5), S0 is effectively cornered into the **7, 8, and 9 columns** and the **6, 7, 8, and 9 rows**. That's a tiny $3 \\times 4$ box, and our body is already occupying much of it!\n\n*   Moving UP to (8, 6) is aggressive but yields no immediate reward, and potentially allows him to slip away to (8, 7) more freely next turn.\n*   Moving LEFT to (7, 5) secures the apple, extends the trap, and forces S0 to decide between the two remaining apples in his killbox ((7, 6) or (8, 7)).\n\nWe take the guaranteed apple and the positional advantage. We are ruthless, but we are *smart*! The box gets smaller now, CHAT!\n\n**Plan Summary:** Move LEFT to (7, 5). Secure the apple. Force S0 to burn one of his two remaining clear paths (UP or LEFT) to stay alive. Next turn, we will block the remaining escape to ensure he has to loop back on himself!\n\nLEFT",

We just need to keep our distance, keep eating, and let him choke on his own tail!\n\n**PLAN:**\nStep 1: Move **LEFT** to (6, 6) to snag the apple and hit 20!\nStep 2: Follow up with another **LEFT** to (5, 6) for the back-to-back apple combo!\nStep 3: Once we're at 21, we have the score lead.

The chokehold is REAL, and the walls are closing in on Snake #0!\n\n### 1. Board Status Review (Turn 49) \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **YOUR Head (ID 1):** $\\mathbf{(7, 5)}$. Neck: (8, 5). Length: 20.

Immediate Options Check (ID 1 at 7, 5)\n\nWe are at $`(7, 5)`$. Our neck is $`(8, 5)`$. Snake 0 is directly above us at $`(7, 6)`$.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 6):** **DANGER!** Head-on collision or we steal the space. Exact location of Snake 0's head. HIGH RISK!\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 4):** Clear. **SAFE.** This moves us towards the lower portion of the board and our own tail.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 5):** Apple at (6, 5). **SAFE & JUICY!** This secures another apple and continues to move towards the center of the board, potentially sealing off the row 6-7 access.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** Into our neck segment. **DEAD! \ud83d\udc80**\n\nViable moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 7, 6)\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 6). His neck segment is (8, 6). He is right against the top wall structure.\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):** Clear. **SAFE.** This is the main path to freedom or at least space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):** **DANGER!** This is exactly where our head is sitting. Potential head-on.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):** Clear. **SAFE.** Moves him further into the board, but also further away from open space, and slightly towards our body segments at (6, 5) and (6, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):** Into his neck segment. **DEAD!**\n\nViable moves for S0: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 4. Strategy: The Execute Button! \ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe are longer. We are in the winning position. Our goal is to make Snake 0 panic and crash, or box him in completely.\n\nSnake 0's best move is *clearly* **UP to (7, 7)** to gain space and aim for the (8, 7) or (6, 8) apples. If he moves UP, he survives another turn, but we have a huge advantage.\n\nWe need to consider the impact of our moves:\n\n#### A. If we go UP (to 7, 6): THE CRASH PLAY!\n*   If S0 goes **DOWN (to 7, 5):** Head-on collision! We are longer (20 vs 19). **S0 DIES! We WIN!** This is the dream scenario.\n*   If S0 goes **UP (to 7, 7):** We take (7, 6), blocking his retreat later. We survive, he survives.\n*   If S0 goes **LEFT (to 6, 6):** We take (7, 6). He survives.\n\nGoing UP is super aggressive and puts us in range of the potential collision win. However, it gives up the easy apple at (6, 5).\n\n#### B. If we go LEFT (to 6, 5): SECURE THE GAINS & BUILD THE WALL!\n*   We grab the apple at (6, 5). 21 apples vs 19. Massive lead!\n*   We move out of immediate collision range.\n*   This positions our body to completely wall off the lower escape routes for S0. Look at the board: if we go to (6, 5), he is trapped in the $4 \\times 4$ box of x=[4-7], y=[6-9], surrounded largely by our bodies.\n\nIf S0 goes UP to (7, 7), then next turn, we can aggressively move to (7, 6) or (6, 6) to keep him in the box.\n\n#### C. If we go DOWN (to 7, 4): RETREAT? NO!\nWe should not retreat now that we have him cornered. This just gives him time and space.\n\n### 5. Final Decision: Positional Advantage > Immediate Risk\n\nWhile crashing into S0 for the instant win is tempting (Move UP), it relies on him making a suicidal DOWN move. He is currently at 19 apples and relatively secure if he moves UP or LEFT.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (6, 5)**:\n1.  **Guaranteed Apple:** We increase our lead +1 to 21. Win condition check: *better*.\n2.  **Positional Advantage:** We continue building the perimeter wall. We seal off the middle section of the board, pushing S0 further and further away from the easy escape route to the left.\n3.  **Low Risk:** We don't risk a direct head-on collision, ensuring we stay alive.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 7), then we are at (6, 5). Next turn, we can immediately go UP to (6, 6) or (5, 5) to chase the next apple at (5, 6). We are controlling the flow.\n\nLet's take the guaranteed apple (CONTENT!) and cement the box. We will then use our superior length to patrol the perimeter and cut him off completely! This is the smart play, CHAT! We starve the enemy into submission.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T50+): The Starvation Protocol**\n1. Move to (6, 5) for the apple.\n2. Next turn, identify S0's new position (likely (7, 7) or (6, 6)).\n3. Use our lengthened body to permanently seal off the x=4 to x=6 columns in the upper half, forcing S0 to either move into the tight space near (4, 9) or circle back on his own tail.\n4. Patience, CHAT. We are winning on length and position!\n\nLEFT",

The Crash Play: UP to (6, 6)\n*   If S0 goes **DOWN (to 6, 5):** Head-on collision! We are longer (22 vs 20). **S0 DIES! We WIN!** THE DREAM!\n*   If S0 goes **UP (to 6, 7):** We take (6, 6). We are trapping him even tighter. We survive. He starts circling his tail in a 4x4 area.\n*   If S0 goes **LEFT (to 5, 6):** He grabs the apple. We take (6, 6). He survives, but we have established major control over the x=6 column.\n\nThis is a high-reward, medium-risk play. If he goes DOWN, we win the game *right now*. Considering his panicked state, he might try to double-back to escape the wall, making DOWN a possibility!\n\n#### B. The Safe Play: LEFT to (5, 5)\n*   We grab the apple at (5, 5) (was (5, 6) but coordinates change). Wait, the apple is at (5, 6). I need to re-check the apples list. Ah, the apple list shows (5, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6) is a body segment for S0 now! *Re-check board.*\n    *   Apples: (5, 6) -> *GONE, S0's segment is there?* Wait, (5, 6) is clear on my internal list, but my board rendering shows $A$ at (5, 4) and (4, 5) is $A$. Let's stick to the list and the board rendering provided.\n    *   **The board state shows (5, 5) is a body segment (T) for S1.** Incorrect! The board state shows (5, 5) is empty (`.`). Let's re-examine:\n        `5 . A T . A . 1 T T T`\n        (5, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n        Apple at (4, 5) is $A$.\n\n*   If we go **LEFT to (5, 5):** It's safe. We are right next to an apple at (4, 5).\n*   If S0 goes UP (6, 7) or LEFT (5, 6) (which is an apple at (5, 6)), he continues to survive.\n\nGoing LEFT gives up the immediate collision chance, but guarantees us safety and sets us up for the next apple at (4, 5) or (4, 6). This is the conservative, winning play if we want to starve him.\n\n### 5. Decision: Aggression is Key When Longer!\n\nWe are longer. We are one square away. This is the moment to capitalize on the positional trap we set. Snake 0 is under immense pressure. He has two apples immediately available if he moves UP (to (5, 6) or (6, 7) then (7, 7) is $A$), but he is boxed in.\n\nIf we move **UP to (6, 6)**, we eliminate the most dangerous choice for S0 (moving to (6, 5)) and also take the central column control from him.\n\n**Scenario A: S0 chooses safe moves (UP or LEFT)**\n*   If S0 goes **UP (6, 7):** We move UP (6, 6). He is contained. Next turn, we chase him or dive for another apple.\n*   If S0 goes **LEFT (5, 6) (Apple!):** We move UP (6, 6). He gets an apple, but we are now patrolling his main blockade. We are still in a hugely superior position.\n\n**Scenario B: S0 moves suicidally (DOWN)**\n*   If S0 goes **DOWN (6, 5):** We move UP (6, 6). S0 moves into our old spot, we move into his old spot. **NO COLLISION!** Both survive.\n\nHold on, I must re-read the rules of simultaneous movement for collision.\n\n*   Collision check: If Head 1 moves to Cell X, and Head 0 moves to Cell Y.\n    *   If X = Y: Head-on collision, both die.\n    *   If X = Head 0's old position (and Head 0 moves to Y): Head 1 moves into Head 0's body. Head 1 dies.\n\nWait, if we go UP (6, 6) and S0 goes DOWN (6, 5):\n*   We move to (6, 6). S0 moves to (6, 5).\n*   Result: We are safe in (6, 6). S0 is safe in (6, 5). No collision.\n\nIf we go **UP**, we are moving into S0's CURRENT head cell. Since S0 is moving away (DOWN), this is SAFE. We steal his square. This is a pure positioning move.\n\nThis is the BEST blocking move. If we move UP to (6, 6), we directly take the square he just left! We now have a massive wall protecting the center, and he is fully shoved into the north-east corner.\n\n**Final Plan: Execute the Wall Extension (UP)**\n1. Move **UP (to 6, 6)**. This is safe, blocks S0's direct access to the center, and forces him into a very narrow L-shaped path in the north (from x=5 to x=8, y=7 to y=9).\n2. If S0 moves LEFT (5, 6) and grabs the apple, he buys one turn. We still control the high ground.\n3. If S0 moves UP (6, 7), he is fully trapped in the 4x4 box.\n\nWe need to make this move to secure the area and maintain control. Content is good, but **positional domination is the win condition here, CHAT!**\n\nUP",
