Yes, it's within the board and no snake bodies there.\n   - Is there an apple? No.\n   - Does it keep future options open? Yes, it moves away from the enemy snake and towards some apples.\n\n2. DOWN: (2, 4)\n   - Is it safe? Yes, it's within the board and no snake bodies there.\n   - Is there an apple? No.\n   - Does it keep future options open? Yes, it moves towards some apples.\n\n3. LEFT: (1, 5)\n   - Is it safe? Yes, it's within the board and no snake bodies there.\n   - Is there an apple? No.\n   - Does it keep future options open? Yes, it moves towards some apples.\n\n4. RIGHT: (3, 5)\n   - Is it safe? Yes, it's within the board and no snake bodies there.\n   - Is there an apple? No.\n   - Does it keep future options open? Yes, it moves towards some apples.\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no bodies on the board yet. Let's consider which move is best:\n\n- UP: Moves towards the apple at (1, 7) and (6, 8)\n- DOWN: Moves towards the apple at (8, 4)\n- LEFT: Moves towards the apple at (1, 7)\n- RIGHT: Moves towards the apple at (8, 4)\n\nI think moving UP or LEFT would be good since they move towards the apple at (1, 7), which is relatively close. Let me choose UP as it also moves away from the enemy snake at (4, 9).\n\nSo my move will be UP.<|end_of_box|>\nUP",

Also, moving RIGHT keeps me away from the enemy snake's current position.\n\nLong-term strategy note: Focus on the closer apples first (5,2) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. Avoid getting boxed in near the bottom edge.\n\nAfter careful consideration, RIGHT seems like the better move as it:\n1. Is safe\n2. Moves toward a reachable apple\n3.

It's relatively far from me, so immediate collision is unlikely. Since moving DOWN would let me eat the apple at (0, 3) and increase my score, this seems like the best move.

UP: Move to (0, 4)\n   - NOT SAFE: Would move into my own body segment at (0, 4)\n\n2. DOWN: Move to (0, 2)\n   - Safe: Within board, not into my body, not into enemy body\n   - Moves away from apple at (0, 3), closer to apple at (4, 1)\n\n3. LEFT: Move to (-1, 3)\n   - NOT SAFE: Would move off the board (x < 0)\n\n4. RIGHT: Move to (1, 3)\n   - Safe: Within board, not into my body, not into enemy body\n   - Moves away from apple at (0, 3), closer to apple at (4, 1)\n\nI have two safe options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (3, 0) and appears to be moving upward. It's relatively far from me, so immediate collision is unlikely.\n\nAmong the remaining apples, the closest one is at (5, 2), which is 5 units to the right and 1 unit down from my current position. The apple at (4, 1) is 4 units to the right and 2 units down. Since RIGHT gets me closer to the apple at (5, 2), I'll choose RIGHT to move towards this apple.\n\nRIGHT\n<|begin_of_box|>RIGHT<|end_of_box|>",
