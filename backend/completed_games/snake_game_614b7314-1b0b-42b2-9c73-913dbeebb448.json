          "rationale": "The board size is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\nMy snake (ID 0) head is at (3, 8). My body is empty.\nEnemy snake (ID 1) head is at (9, 3). Its body is empty.\nApples are at: A1=(5, 4), A2=(9, 0), A3=(0, 8), A4=(3, 3), A5=(9, 8).\n\nMy immediate safety check:\n1. ** Boundaries (0-9):**\n   - UP: (3, 9) - Safe.\n   - DOWN: (3, 7) - Safe.\n   - LEFT: (2, 8) - Safe.\n   - RIGHT: (4, 8) - Safe.\n2. ** Self-collision:** Since my body is empty, no self-collision is possible other than moving backward into the tail, which doesn't exist. However, moving backward is only an issue if the snake occupies that space later. For now, all positions are safe from my current body.\n3. ** Enemy collision:** Snake 1 head is at (9, 3).\n   - UP to (3, 9): Safe from Snake 1 head.\n   - DOWN to (3, 7): Safe from Snake 1 head.\n   - LEFT to (2, 8): Safe from Snake 1 head.\n   - RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe from Snake 1 head.\n\nAll four moves are currently safe from immediate self-destruction or collision with Snake 1's current head position.\n\nNow, I must evaluate the strategic value of each move, considering apple locations and enemy movement. Both snakes move simultaneously.\n\nEnemy Snake 1 at (9, 3) is quite far. It is closest to apples at (9, 0) and potentially (5, 4) or (3, 3).\n\nMy current position (3, 8) is adjacent to an apple at (0, 8) (A3).\n\n**Target Apples Analysis:**\n*   A3 at (0, 8): Closest apple. I need 3 LEFT moves to reach it.\n*   A1 at (5, 4): Mid-range.\n*   A4 at (3, 3): Directly below. I need 5 DOWN moves to reach it.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** Moves further away from all apples, especially the nearest one (0, 8). Does not significantly improve position.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Moves slightly closer to the cluster of apples below (A4 at (3, 3) and A1 at (5, 4)). It brings me closer to the center mass of the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** This is the best direction for reaching the nearest apple (0, 8). It takes 2 more left moves to reach it immediately.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Moves me across the top edge, away from the closest apple cluster, towards the right side where Snake 1 resides, but still far from any apple Snake 1 might target immediately.\n\n**Collision Check with Predicted Enemy Move:**\nEnemy Snake 1 at (9, 3) will move. Since the enemy has no history or known strategy, I must consider moves that minimize the risk of future collision, although predicting an exact move is speculative. Assuming the enemy might move towards the nearest apples (9, 0) or try to move towards the center.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 8):\nEnemy could move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. If they move RIGHT to (10, 3) they die (off-board). If they move UP/DOWN/LEFT, no immediate collision is apparent on Turn 1.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 7):\nThis puts me in a better central area for future maneuvering, especially towards (5, 4) and (3, 3). It seems like a reasonable setup move.\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs DOWN:**\n*   LEFT gains the most ground towards the closest apple A3 (0, 8).\n*   DOWN prepares better for access to centrally located apples A1 (5, 4) and A4 (3, 3).\n\nGiven that I have 0 length, any move path is viable unless an apple is immediately reachable or blocked. The apple at (0, 8) is 3 moves away. Moving LEFT puts me at (2, 8). The next move LEFT gets me to (1, 8), and the move after that eats the apple at (0, 8) if no one interferes. This seems like the most direct path to securing a point quickly.\n\nStrategy Note: Focus on the nearest apple (0, 8) at the top left. Prioritize moving towards it safely.\n\nPath to (0, 8): (3, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (0, 8) [Eat]\n\nI will choose LEFT to start closing the distance to A3.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Acquire the apple at (0, 8). Then re-evaluate proximity to (5, 4) and (3, 3). Keep an eye on Snake 1's general location (far right).\n\nLEFT is the most aggressive move towards a tangible immediate goal (Apple A3).\n\nLEFT",
