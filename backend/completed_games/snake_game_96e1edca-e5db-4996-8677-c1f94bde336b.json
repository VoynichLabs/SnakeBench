YIKES, instant death \u274c\nLEFT to (8,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\nRIGHT \u2014 off board (x=10), instant death \u274c\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are possible.\n\nNow, enemy at (0,0). Their safe moves are RIGHT to (1,0) or UP to (0,1). They might go for the apple at (2,1) or (1,3) eventually, but first turn they\u2019ll probably avoid me.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,2), I\u2019m moving toward center-top, keeping distance. If I go LEFT to (8,1), I\u2019m moving closer to the middle but still far from enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: I want to control the center and cut off enemy expansion. They\u2019re in bottom-left corner. I should wrap around top-right side and come down, boxing them in against the wall. If I go UP now, I have more flexibility to go across the top later.\n\nAlso, going LEFT puts me closer to my own tail later (once I grow), but for now it\u2019s fine. But UP gives more open space.\n\nChat, what do you think? \ud83e\udd14 UP feels like the play \u2014 claim the high ground, literally! Let\u2019s set up for a wide flank.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move across top row toward left, force enemy to stay pinned in bottom-left.

Long term, we want to be the *bigger* snake so we can later force those head-on 50/50s in OUR favor \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo the aggressive, board-control-oriented line is to move RIGHT and start cruising along the bottom toward those juicy apples and the mid-board.\n\n---\n\nStrategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0:\n- Early plan: push along the bottom row toward the central apples (3,0) / (2,1) area, then curve up into the middle.  \n- Priority: grow quickly while maintaining lots of open escape routes; avoid getting pinned to a wall too long.  \n- Keep an eye on when the enemy starts drifting toward center from (9,1); once we\u2019re longer, start plotting a wide arc to eventually cut off their return path and box them against a wall or our body.  \n\nRIGHT",

Apples are everywhere but we're playing the long game \u2014 DOMINANCE!\n\n**CHECKING MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP** to (9,3) \u2014 That's empty! Safe.\n2. **DOWN** to (9,1) \u2014 Wait, that's where my head *was* last turn, but my body is only the head right now, so it's actually empty. That's safe too! No body yet.\n3. **LEFT** to (8,2) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2014 Off board (x=10) \u274c **DEATH!** Eliminated.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe immediately.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (1,0) can go UP to (1,1), RIGHT to (2,0), or DOWN/LEFT off-board. They'll likely go UP or RIGHT toward apples (2,1) or (1,3). They might avoid coming straight at me since I'm far.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nI want to start boxing them in the bottom-left. If I go LEFT to (8,2), I'm moving toward center-left, maybe cutting off their expansion upward. If I go UP to (9,3), I'm staying near top edge \u2014 could go across top row next. If I go DOWN to (9,1), I'm closer to bottom but still far from them.\n\nBut wait \u2014 going DOWN puts me closer to my own future tail after I eat an apple, but right now it's fine. However, I want to control more space. Going LEFT or UP gives more options next turn.\n\n**SAFETY NEXT TURN:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,2), next turn I could go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \nIf I go UP to (9,3), next turn I could go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Right is off-board, so only DOWN, LEFT, UP? UP to (9,4) is safe.  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,1), next turn I could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT? Right off-board, so UP, LEFT, DOWN.\n\nActually, going DOWN limits me because I'm against bottom row soon. Going UP or LEFT keeps more board space.\n\n**AGGRESSION:**  \nEnemy is at (1,0). I want to wrap around top and come down left side to trap them. So moving LEFT toward (8,2) then (7,2) etc. sets that flank.\n\nBut also, there's an apple at (7,2) \u2014 if I go LEFT now, next turn I could go LEFT again to (7,2) and grab it, growing to length 2. That's early growth and blocks that apple from them.\n\nChat, what's the play? \ud83e\udd14 I think LEFT sets up the flank, gets me toward an apple next turn, and starts the boxing maneuver! Let's be aggressive but smart.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward (7,2) for apple, then continue leftward along y=2 or y=3 to cut off enemy's upward escape. Force them against bottom wall.\n\nLEFT",

Still good, but not maximally exploiting our current angle along the bottom.\n\n3) RIGHT to (2,0):\n- From (2,0), we have 3 legal next moves: UP (2,1), LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0).\n- Moves us directly toward the dense bottom cluster:\n  - (3,0) is then only one more step away.\n  - From there we can pivot up into (2,1)/(3,1)/center.\n- Keeps us extending along the bottom, which is fine early as long as we don\u2019t go too deep without an exit.\n- Enemy is far on the right (9,2) so there\u2019s zero head-on risk soon; we can safely rush growth.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, RIGHT gets us to quick, uncontested apples fastest while keeping acceptable future options. More length now means more body later to use as walls when we finally invade his side and look for a box-in or a favorable head-on.\n\nSo we stick to the original plan: push along the bottom toward the central apples, then curve up into mid once we\u2019ve banked some growth.\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- Target path: (1,0) \u2192 (2,0) \u2192 (3,0 apple), then start working upward into the (2,1)/(3,1)/(5,1)/(5,2) zone.\n- Always keep at least two safe escape lanes open; don\u2019t make tight corridors along the bottom wall without a planned exit.\n- Watch when the enemy leaves the right edge toward center; once we\u2019re clearly longer, start thinking about cutting off his retreat lines and forcing him into our body or a bad head-on.\n\nRIGHT",

No walls, no bodies.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (2, 0) can go:\n- UP to (2, 1) \u2014 empty, apple at (2, 1)!\n- RIGHT to (3, 0) \u2014 empty, apple at (3, 0)!\n- LEFT to (1, 0) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN off board \u2192 \u274c death, unlikely.\n\nThey'll probably go UP for apple (2, 1) or RIGHT for apple (3, 0). Either way, they're moving away from me for now.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2) and they go\u2026 nowhere near me. No risk.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), they can't reach me.\nIf I go UP/DOWN, same.\n\nSo all safe from head-on this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe want to box them in bottom-left! I'm at (8, 2). Moving LEFT to (7, 2) grabs apple, grows to length 2, and starts cutting off their upward escape along y=2 row. Next turn, I could continue left to (6, 2) or go up/down to control more space. Growing early gives me body to protect myself and threaten head-on collisions later when I have longer length.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 2), I'm against right wall \u2014 limits options. UP or DOWN just moves without growth yet.\n\n**BEST MOVE?**\nLEFT to (7, 2) gets apple, grows, moves toward enemy flank, keeps multiple options open next turn (UP/DOWN/LEFT from (7, 2)). Sets up boxing maneuver!\n\nChat, this is the play \u2014 AGGRESSIVE GROWTH while advancing our position! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Auto-throw. Eliminate.\n\n2) LEFT \u2192 (1,0)  \n   - On board, empty, no body segment there (we\u2019re length 1, \u201cBody: none\u201d).  \n   - Safe this turn. No apple.\n\n3) RIGHT \u2192 (3,0)  \n   - On board, and there IS an apple at (3,0).  \n   - Eat apple \u2192 we grow to length 2 and go up 1\u20130 on the scoreboard.  \n   - After that, we\u2019re on the bottom wall; from (3,0) with body at (2,0), legal next moves: (4,0), (3,1).

Next turn legal moves: (2,2), (1,1), (3,1) \u2014 3 safe neighboring cells (can\u2019t go back to (2,0)).  \n   - This move pulls us off the hard bottom wall and into the central lanes, which is exactly where we want to be later to dominate space and eventually box the enemy.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy at (8,2). Their possible moves: (8,3), (8,1), (7,2 apple), (9,2).\n- They\u2019re far away; no immediate head-on collision risk regardless of what we do.\n- Since both snakes are 0 apples right now, there is no incentive to rush a tie head-on; we want to grow first, then leverage our lead to threaten collisions later.\n\nBetween the two apple moves:\n- RIGHT to (3,0): good for growth but keeps us glued to the bottom wall with fewer future options.\n- UP to (2,1): same immediate reward (apple + length), but more future mobility (three directions vs two) and better central positioning for eventual control and boxing.\n\nGiven the rules to favor:\n- Survival \u2192 both UP and RIGHT are safe.\n- Apple access \u2192 both give an apple.\n- Future options \u2192 UP clearly wins.\nSo we take the higher-flexibility, more centralizing apple: move UP.\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- After grabbing (2,1), look to chain nearby apples while staying flexible: routes toward (3,0), (3,0)/(5,1)/(5,2)/(5,3) are all juicy.  \n- Grow quickly in the lower-center/center-left, then start sliding rightward across rows 2\u20134 to cut off the enemy\u2019s retreat lanes from the right side.  \n- Once we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples/length, start setting up angles that tempt or force the opponent into bad head-on lines against our thicker body or straight-up walls created by us.\n\nUP",

But careful \u2014 my body is [(7,2), (8,2)]. Moving RIGHT into (8,2) is moving into my *tail* cell. However, my tail will move forward this turn if I don't eat an apple!

Moving RIGHT into (8,2) would be moving into my own body segment \u2014 **DEATH**! \u274c So RIGHT is **NOT SAFE**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (2,1) can go:\n- UP to (2,2) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (2,0) \u2014 that's their own tail! But same logic: they just ate last turn, so their tail stays at (2,0) this turn. Moving DOWN into (2,0) would be suicide for them \u2014 unlikely unless they're throwing.\n- LEFT to (1,1) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,1) \u2014 empty.\n\nThey'll probably avoid DOWN (into tail). They might go UP toward apple at (2,5) long-term, or LEFT/RIGHT to explore. Apple at (1,3) is close too.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (6,2), they can't reach me in one move.\nIf I go UP to (7,3) or DOWN to (7,1), no risk.\nSo all safe from head-on this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe want to box them in bottom-left! I'm at (7,2). Moving LEFT to (6,2) advances toward enemy, cuts off their rightward escape, and keeps my body as a barrier along y=2. Moving UP to (7,3) moves toward apple at (7,6) eventually but drifts away from enemy. Moving DOWN to (7,1) moves toward apple at (5,1) but also away from enemy.\n\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE \u2014 pressure them! LEFT gets us closer, controls center, and sets up future cutting moves. Also from (6,2) next turn I can go UP/DOWN/LEFT to continue surrounding.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter LEFT to (6,2), next turn consider:\n- If enemy moves toward top, maybe go UP to (6,3) to block.\n- If enemy stays low, maybe go LEFT again to (5,2) \u2014 there's an apple at (5,2)!\nGoal: force them against wall or into our body by controlling space.\n\nLEFT is the AGGRESSIVE boxing move!

No collision gambles yet; we only want head-on if we\u2019re ahead.\n\nWe must check all 4 directions:\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN from (2,1) \u2192 (2,0)\n\n- That\u2019s our own body segment / tail from last turn.\n- Moving directly backwards into our own body = instant death by rules.\n\nResult: DOWN is an auto-throw. Delete it from the options.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT from (2,1) \u2192 (1,1)\n\n- On the board, not our body, not theirs. Safe this turn.\n- After move (no apple), new snake:\n  - Head: (1,1)\n  - Body: [(2,1)]\n- Future options next turn (ignoring future enemy move):\n  - (1,2), (0,1) \u2014 2 safe non-backwards options.\n- Positionally, this leans us toward the left-side apple ladder:\n  - (1,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (2,5).\n- It\u2019s fine, but commits us somewhat to the far-left corridor early.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT from (2,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n\n- On board, empty, safe this turn.\n- After move (no apple), new snake:\n  - Head: (3,1)\n  - Body: [(2,1)]\n- Next-turn options:\n  - (3,2), (4,1), (3,0) \u2014 all on-board, so 3 exits.\n- This points us straight at the juicy bottom cluster:\n  - (3,0) in 1 move, then potentially (5,0), (6,0), etc.\n- But: the enemy\u2019s nearest rich cluster is column 5 (5,2, 5,3, 5,1, 5,0).\n  - If we dive bottom while they rush column 5, they probably win the column\u20115 race and end up chaining apples faster than we can contest, getting an early length lead plus central control.\n\nIs RIGHT good? It\u2019s not bad, but it encourages a race for the bottom/center where the enemy is naturally better positioned, and we risk being slightly behind in apples while they control the core lanes.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP from (2,1) \u2192 (2,2)\n\n- On the board, empty, safe this turn.\n- After move (no apple), new snake:\n  - Head: (2,2)\n  - Body: [(2,1)]\n- Next-turn options:\n  - (2,3), (1,2), (3,2) \u2014 3 good non-backwards exits.\n- Strategic perks:\n  - We step off the low ground and into the central band of the board.\n  - From (2,2) we can still pivot:\n    - Left to the safe left-side ladder (1,3, 0,4, 0,6, 0,7, 2,5).\n    - Right toward mid apples at column 5 if the enemy *doesn\u2019t* hard commit there.\n    - Down-right route to (3,0) if the enemy goes elsewhere.\n- We also keep maximum information value: once we see how Snake #1 moves this turn (UP / DOWN / LEFT), we\u2019ll have better reads on where to race for space and apples next.\n\nGiven the current distance, there is no immediate collision risk in any of the safe directions this move. So our priority is future flexibility + strong central positioning, not raw apple greed on a risky race line.\n\nLEFT = safe but commits us to the extreme left early.  \nRIGHT = safe but invites a direct race for the column\u20115/bottom cluster that likely favors the enemy.  \nUP = safest and most flexible, keeps us central with three exits and lets us react to the enemy\u2019s commitment next turn.\n\nThe aggressive play isn\u2019t about mindlessly charging; it\u2019s about setting up the board so that in 3\u20135 turns we\u2019re the one cutting off their escape routes. Moving UP now gives us the best leverage to do that.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n- From (2,2), watch where Snake #1 goes:\n  - If they dive LEFT toward (5,2) and the column\u20115 stack:\n    - We should quickly choose whether to:\n      - Contest mid from the left via (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 pressure column 5, *without* entering direct head-on lanes while we\u2019re shorter; or\n      - Pivot hard left/up to farm the 1,3 \u2192 0,4 \u2192 2,5 \u2192 0,6 \u2192 0,7 chain, building a big, safe body on the left half before sweeping back across the middle to box them.\n  - If they go DOWN toward (7,1)/(6,0):\n    - We can own the central band: (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (5,2)/(5,3) while they\u2019re low, then later slice above them to trap.\n  - If they go UP toward (7,3)/(7,6)/(8,7):\n    - We can grab central and bottom apples more freely, then force them into the top-right corner over time.\n- Overall: grow to 4\u20136 length as safely as possible *without* conceding the middle. Once we\u2019re longer, start steering them into corridors where any attempt to exit runs their head into our body. Only then start actively hunting head-on angles.\n\nup",

Time to apply PRESSURE!\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- My head: (6, 2) \u2014 length 2 (head at (6,2), tail at (7,2)).\n- Enemy head: (2, 2) \u2014 length 2 (head at (2,2), tail at (2,1)).\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (4 moves):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6, 3) \u2014 Empty on board.

Since I did NOT eat last turn, my tail will move forward this turn (it was at (7,2) and will move to where? Actually, my tail is at (7,2) now, and my head moves first. If I move RIGHT into (7,2), that's currently occupied by my tail, but after I move, my tail will shift? Wait \u2014 snakes move simultaneously, but body updates after: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment's position, tail leaves its old cell. So at the moment of movement, (7,2) is still my tail. Moving into it is moving into my own body \u2014 **DEATH**! \u274c So RIGHT is **NOT SAFE**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (2,2) can go:\n- UP to (2,3) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (2,1) \u2014 that's their own tail! Since they didn't eat last turn, tail moves, but at move time (2,1) is occupied \u2014 risky for them, probably avoid.\n- LEFT to (1,2) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,2) \u2014 empty.\n\nThey'll likely avoid DOWN into tail. They might go UP toward apples at (2,5) or (1,3), or LEFT/RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (5,2), enemy could go RIGHT to (3,2) \u2014 no collision.\nIf I go UP to (6,3) or DOWN to (6,1), no risk.\nAll safe from head-on this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY \u2014 BOX THEM IN!**\nWe want to dominate the center and cut off enemy escape! Moving LEFT to (5,2) gets us closer, puts us near apple at (5,2) next turn, and starts a horizontal barrier along y=2. Moving UP to (6,3) moves toward apple at (5,3) but drifts away from enemy. Moving DOWN to (6,1) moves toward apple at (5,1) but also away.\n\nAGGRESSIVE PLAY: Go LEFT! From (5,2), next turn we can threaten to go LEFT again to (4,2) or UP/DOWN to block. We force enemy toward the left wall (x=0). If they go UP toward apples, we can mirror and cut them off.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter LEFT to (5,2):\n- If enemy moves UP to (2,3), consider going UP to (5,3) to claim apple and maintain horizontal pressure.\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (1,2), go LEFT to (4,2) to close distance.\nGoal: trap them in the corner by controlling the center-right.

Great safety, but we risk letting them be king of mid.\n\n---\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT from (2,2) \u2192 (3,2)\n\n- On-board, empty, safe this turn \u2705\n- New body: head (3,2), body [(2,2)]\n- Next turn options from (3,2):\n  - UP: (3,3)\n  - RIGHT: (4,2)\n  - DOWN: (3,1)\n- This points us straight at:\n  - (3,0) apple below,  \n  - then the huge column-5 stack near the enemy.\n- But look at the enemy: from (6,2) they can go:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,2) (apple)  \n  - UP \u2192 (6,3)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,1)\n- Most \u201cgreedy + central\u201d line for them is clearly LEFT to (5,2) \ud83c\udf4f\n  - If they do that and we go RIGHT to (3,2), next turn:\n    - We at (3,2), they at (5,2) with length 3 and 2 apples.\n    - The cell (4,2) between us becomes a **head-on trap**:\n      - If we ever try to step into (4,2) while they also step in? Double KO.\n      - But then apples: they\u2019d be at 2, we stay at 1 \u2192 they WIN the tiebreak if we both die.\n- So RIGHT pulls us into a central lane where **we\u2019re slightly behind and can\u2019t accept head-ons**.

That\u2019s how we box this dude in, not by flipping a coin on a head-on when we\u2019re not ahead yet \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Long-term note to future me (you\u2019re welcome, streamer brain)\n\n- From (2,3), **watch enemy\u2019s commitment**:\n  - If they go LEFT to (5,2) and start stacking apples on column 5:\n    - We should quickly take the safe value route:\n      - Hit (1,3) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (2,5)/(0,6)/(0,7), building a big snake on the left half.\n    - Once we\u2019re comfortably longer, rotate back toward center from above (via 2\u20134 columns) and start forming a horizontal wall that cuts off their escape from the right side.\n  - If they instead go UP to (6,3):\n    - We can dive for central apples like (5,2)/(5,3) via 3\u20134 columns, trying to **match or beat** their length while staying slightly offset vertically to avoid free head-ons.\n  - If they go DOWN to (6,1):\n    - We own mid and top. Farm 1,3\u21920,4\u21922,5 and maybe 5,3/5,7 later, then sink down on them from above, forcing them into tight corridors near the bottom wall.\n- Big picture: hit 4\u20136 length safely, deny them clean lanes to rotate out, then leverage our body as a moving wall. Only start aiming for head-on traps when we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and length.\n\nUP",

We\u2019re smaller and behind on score \u2014 not where we want to be for future kill setups.\n\n#### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT to (1,3) \ud83c\udf4e\n- We instantly eat an apple and go from:\n  - Before: H (2,3), body [(2,2)]\n  - After apple: H (1,3), body [(2,3),(2,2)] \u2192 length 3, apples 2 \ud83d\ude08\n- Occupied cells after move: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2).\n- Next turn from (1,3):  \n  - UP \u2192 (1,4)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,2)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,3)  \n  - RIGHT (2,3) is backwards \u274c  \n  So we still have **three** good exits and a ton of space.\n- Strategic juice:\n  - We grab guaranteed value **this turn** instead of \u201cmaybe later\u201d.\n  - We start building a thicker body on the left side, with a super clean apple ladder:\n    - (1,3) we eat now\n    - Then (0,4) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,7)\n    - Plus (2,5) lurking nearby later\n  - Meanwhile, enemy is busy in the 4\u20137 columns, likely farming (5,3) or (5,1).  \n    That\u2019s PERFECT: we let them drift right/bottom while we stack mass on the left/top.\n\nWe want to:\n- Stay alive \u2705\n- Grow fast \u2705\n- Keep space + future options \u2705\n- Avoid head-on trades while behind \u2705\n\nLEFT gives us **immediate growth** and keeps us far enough from the enemy to avoid dumb coinflips, while setting up a big snake that can later slide back across the board to box them in. That\u2019s exactly our win condition.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term note to future me\n\n- Priority next few turns: **farm the left ladder**:\n  - After (1,3), look to route toward (0,4), then (0,6)/(0,7), and also (2,5) if the timing is clean.\n- Goal: get significantly longer than the enemy (length + apple lead), then swing back toward mid (columns 2\u20134) from above.\n- Once we\u2019re chunky, start laying **horizontal and diagonal walls** across the middle, trying to:\n  - Cut off their paths from right side to left/top.\n  - Herd them toward the bottom-right corner or between our body and the wall.\n- Only start engineering head-on collisions **after** we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples, so if we trade heads we win the game outright.\n- Always track their escapes: any time we can make their \u201conly safe move\u201d run into our body, or force them into a losing head-on, we pull the trigger \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Time to execute the plan and SQUEEZE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (4 moves):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5,2) \u2014 That's my own body segment (current neck)! \u274c Moving into myself = DEATH. NOT SAFE.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,3) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (1,3) just ate the apple at (1,3) last turn (we predicted that!). So now they're length 3, head at (1,3), body: [(2,3), (2,2)].\nThey can go:\n- UP to (1,4) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (1,2) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT to (0,3) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (2,3) \u2014 That's their own body! \u274c NOT SAFE for them.\n\nSo their safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If I go LEFT to (4,3), enemy could go RIGHT? No, that's unsafe for them. So no head-on.\n- If I go UP to (5,4), enemy could go UP to (1,4) \u2014 no collision.\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,3), enemy could go UP/DOWN/LEFT \u2014 no collision.\nAll safe from head-on this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 EXECUTE THE BOX!**\nLast turn's plan: After eating at (5,3), move LEFT to (4,3) to establish a horizontal wall at y=3, cutting enemy off from the right side! \u2705\n\nGoing LEFT to (4,3) does exactly that! It blocks the enemy from easily moving right past x=3. It also keeps us close to apply pressure. From (4,3) next turn, we can go UP/DOWN/LEFT to continue controlling space.\n\nGoing UP or RIGHT would give up that positional pressure and let the enemy potentially sneak toward the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter moving to (4,3):\n- Enemy likely will move UP/DOWN/LEFT away from us.\n- We want to slowly advance leftward, forcing them toward the left wall (x=0).\n- Use our length advantage (4 vs 3) to threaten head-on collisions if they try to move right past us.\n- Eventually trap them against the wall and watch them crash!\n\nAGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!

We gotta bulk up first, then bully \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate all four moves\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- UP \u2192 (1,4)\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2)\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 directly backwards into our own body \u274c auto-death\n\nSo RIGHT is insta-throw, chat. Toss it. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEnemy from (5,3) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (5,4)\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2) is directly backwards into its body \u274c\n\nSo realistically they choose from UP / LEFT / RIGHT. None of those reach anywhere near our three candidate squares this turn:\n- Our options: (1,4), (1,2), (0,3)\n- Their options: (5,4), (4,3), (6,3)\n\nNo overlap, no immediate head-on, no body collisions this turn. All three (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are **safe** for now \u2705\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the safe moves\n\n#### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (0,3)\nNew snake: (0,3) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3); tail (2,2) disappears.\n- Pros:\n  - Starts building a nice horizontal wall at y=3 from x=0\u21922 \ud83d\udcaa\n  - Next moves:  \n    - UP \u2192 (0,4) (apple)  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (0,2)  \n    - RIGHT is backwards into (1,3) \u274c  \n  - Only **2** legal directions afterward (UP/DOWN). We\u2019d be on the wall already with reduced flexibility.\n- Strategic read:\n  - Still safe, still lets us ladder into that sweet left-column apple chain.\n  - But we\u2019re already at the edge and locking out one direction next turn; less maneuverability = more ways to get trapped later.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (1,2)\nNew snake: (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3)\n- Next moves:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,1)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,2)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) (tail cell, now empty)  \n  - UP is backwards into (1,3) \u274c  \n  So we keep 3 options here.\n- But\u2026 this drifts us **toward** the enemy cluster at y=2\u20133 while we\u2019re still smaller.  \n  Do we really want to scrap in close quarters when we\u2019re behind on apples and length? \ud83e\udd28 Not yet.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (1,4)\nNew snake: (1,4) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3)\n- Next moves:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,4)\n  - UP \u2192 (1,5)\n  - DOWN is backwards into (1,3) \u274c  \n  So we also keep **3** good lanes.\n- Positionally:\n  - We stay off the wall for now (more escape routes).\n  - We angle slightly above the enemy, which is perfect for later boxing.\n  - On the very next turn, we can snap LEFT to (0,4) and start that juicy left-ladder of apples while maintaining max flexibility.\n\nComparing:\n- LEFT: safe, lines up apples, but immediately hugs the border and cuts future options to 2.\n- DOWN: keeps options, but walks us into the bigger snake\u2019s neighborhood. That\u2019s asking for trouble while we\u2019re still the little brother.\n- UP: keeps **3 exits**, moves us away from immediate conflict, but still sets up an easy turn-7 apple grab at (0,4). That\u2019s clean positioning AND growth potential. \ud83e\udde0\n\nGiven we want to:\n- Avoid head-on trades while behind \u274c\n- Grow to surpass the enemy \u2705\n- Control space from a safe distance \u2705\n- Keep multiple future options open \u2705\n\nUP is the best balance right now.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Long-term plan for future me (hey, you better read this \ud83d\ude1c)\n\n1. From (1,4), prioritize:\n   - LEFT to (0,4) to grab that apple, then\n   - Climb the left side: (0,5) \u2192 (0,6) (apple) \u2192 (0,7), etc.\n2. Use the left column + upper rows to:\n   - Get **longer than the enemy** first. We want a clear apple/length lead so that any future head-on is in **our** favor.\n3. Once we\u2019re chunky, rotate across the top (y\u22486\u20138) toward the center/right:\n   - Start building horizontal \u201cwalls\u201d that slice the board, pushing the enemy into bottom-right or along the lower middle.\n4. Midgame goal:\n   - Force situations where:\n     - Their only safe move is into our body (they crash, we live \ud83d\ude08), **or**\n     - Any escape leads to a losing head-on because we\u2019re ahead in apples.\n5. Always keep at least 2 safe exits visible; never fully commit to a corner unless we already own the rest of the map.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, turn 7, let\u2019s lock this in.\n\nWe\u2019re at:\n- Our head: (1,4), body: (1,3) \u2192 (2,3), length 3, apples 2  \n- Enemy head: (4,3), body: (5,3) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (6,2), length 4, apples 3  \n\nBoard is wide open, we\u2019re slightly shorter and behind on score. So:\n- We want to grow fast and take uncontested space.\n- We absolutely do NOT want any early head-on trades while they\u2019re ahead, because a double KO right now gives them the win by apples.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four directions from (1,4)\n\n- UP \u2192 (1,5)\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) = directly backwards into our own body \u2192 instant death, illegal\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) = apple\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4)\n\nEnemy from (4,3) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (4,4)\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) is straight back into their neck, so illegal\n\nSo they realistically choose from {UP, LEFT, DOWN}. None of those land anywhere close to our candidate squares this turn:\n- Our options: (0,4), (1,5), (2,4)\n- Their options: (4,4), (3,3), (4,2)\n\nNo overlap, no instant collisions, and none of our target squares are in their future body either. So three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Evaluate each safe move\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (0,4) [apple]\n\nWe eat immediately.\n\nNew snake after move:\n- Head: (0,4)\n- Body: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  (tail stays because we grew)\n\nPros:\n- Instant +1 apple: we go to 3, tying the score if they don\u2019t eat (they actually can\u2019t eat anything this turn).\n- We keep our tail at (2,3), so we maintain that horizontal wall at y=3 from x=1\u20132 and extend control into the corner. Great for boxing later.\n- From (0,4), next-turn legal moves:\n  - UP \u2192 (0,5)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,3)\n  - Right is backwards into (1,4), left is off-board\n  So we\u2019ll have 2 real options next turn.\n\nRisk:\n- Being on the left wall slightly reduces flexibility vs being in open space.\nBut enemy is far (around x=4), can\u2019t pressure the left edge anytime soon, and the left-column apples (0,4), (0,6), (0,7) are basically uncontested food for us.\n\nBig picture: this is the most growth and territory control for the least risk right now.\n\n---\n\n#### UP \u2192 (1,5)\n\nNo apple this move.\n\nNew snake:\n- Head: (1,5)\n- Body: (1,4), (1,3)  (tail (2,3) disappears)\n\nPros:\n- We stay off the wall, with 3 options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,5)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) (apple next turn)\n  - UP \u2192 (1,6)\n- Very flexible shape, lots of escape lanes.\n- We can still grab apples soon (like (2,5), then climb toward (2,8)).\n\nCons:\n- We delay our apple by one full move compared to going LEFT, and we give up the tail at (2,3), opening more room for the enemy to invade the lower-left later.\n- We\u2019re not capitalizing on the free, safe apple at (0,4) that we specifically positioned for last turn.\n\nGood move, but less aggressive on growth and map control than LEFT.\n\n---\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (2,4)\n\nNo apple this move.\n\nNew snake:\n- Head: (2,4)\n- Body: (1,4), (1,3)  (tail (2,3) disappears)\n\nPros:\n- Also 3 options next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (2,5) apple\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,3) (tail cell, which will be empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)\n- Direct, fast path to the (2,5) apple.\n- Keeps us toward center and in the main action.\n\nCons:\n- After RIGHT, consider enemy going UP to (4,4). Next turn:\n  - Our tempting move RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) could be met by their LEFT \u2192 (3,4), creating a head-on collision.\n  - They\u2019re ahead on score, so they would love that double-KO. We cannot safely rely on (3,4) as a future option.\n- That leaves us with effectively 2 \u201csafe\u201d practical options next turn (UP and DOWN), similar to LEFT, but without the immediate apple and without preserving the tail/wall at (2,3).\n\nSo compared to LEFT:\n- Similar flexibility (practically 2 good options under adversarial play),\n- Worse immediate growth,\n- We give up more map control.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic verdict\n\nWe are behind on apples and length. The opponent cannot eat this turn, but we can.\n\n- LEFT to (0,4) gives us:\n  - Instant +1 apple and length, tying the score.\n  - Stronger body footprint by keeping the (2,3) tail segment, which helps in future boxing.\n  - Access to a rich, fairly uncontested left-column apple chain (0,6), (0,7) we can farm over the next few turns.\n- Risk from the opponent is minimal in that corner right now; they\u2019d need several moves to even get close to us, by which time we\u2019ll be much longer.\n\nUP and RIGHT keep us more central, but both delay growth and surrender that beautiful left-side food plus territory. While we\u2019re behind, we want safe, guaranteed apples and expanding body walls, not central bravado that invites a head-on when they\u2019re still ahead.\n\nSo we snap to the corner, grow, and start building our left-side empire.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan for future me\n\n1. From (0,4), prioritize safe vertical growth:\n   - Likely go UP \u2192 (0,5), then aim for (0,6) and potentially (0,7), but be willing to pivot RIGHT early if the enemy starts moving into upper-left.\n2. Maintain a long, solid body stretching from lower-left toward mid-left to create a soft wall the enemy has to respect.\n3. Once we\u2019re at least as long as (or longer than) the enemy, start rotating right across the upper rows (y\u22486\u20138) to slice the board horizontally and begin boxing them toward the lower-right.\n4. Avoid symmetrical \u201cface-off\u201d lines where a single square could be a mutual head target; they love double-KOs while they\u2019re ahead. Only seek head-on setups once we clearly lead in apples.\n5. Always leave at least two safe escape routes each turn; if the enemy starts climbing toward our column, pivot off the wall before we risk being pinned.\n\nLEFT",

They didn't eat this turn (they ate last turn), so their tail will move forward this turn. So (2,3) will be empty after they move! BUT we move simultaneously, so we need to check if their head could land there? Their head at (0,4) can't reach (2,3) in one move. So (2,3) is safe for us to move into. SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 That's my own body (current neck)! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Snake #0 at (0,4), body: [(1,4),(1,3),(2,3)]):**\nThey just ate, so they will grow.

Their safe moves:\n- UP to (0,5) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (0,3) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT to (-1,4) \u2014 off board! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (1,4) \u2014 that's their own body segment (current neck)! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n\nSo their only safe moves: UP or DOWN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If I go LEFT to (2,3): They can't go RIGHT (into themselves) or LEFT (off board). They go UP to (0,5) or DOWN to (0,3). No collision.\n- If I go UP to (3,4): They go UP/DOWN, no collision.\n- If I go DOWN to (3,2): They go UP/DOWN, no collision.\nAll safe from head-on.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 BOX THEM IN HARDER!**\nThey're stuck against the left wall at x=0! Their only moves are UP/DOWN along that wall. We have length 4, they have length 4 (just grew). We're equal length now, so head-on is risky unless we have positional advantage.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,3), we cut off their potential escape to the right next turn. We also position our head directly adjacent to their possible future positions. From (2,3), next turn we could go UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) to mirror them and force a trap.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,4), we're further away, giving them breathing room.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,2), same issue\u2014less pressure.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe want to force them against the left wall and then, when they have no safe moves, they crash. Our length is equal, so we need to use our body to block. Our body at y=3 (segments (4,3),(5,3),(5,2)) forms a partial wall. Moving LEFT to (2,3) extends that wall at y=3, making it harder for them to slide right. They'll be forced up/down until they hit the top/bottom wall.\n\nNext turn, if they go UP to (0,5), we could go UP to (2,4) to stay close. If they go DOWN to (0,3), we could go DOWN to (2,2). Keep mirroring with one column between us. Eventually they run out of board.\n\nAGGRESSIVE CAGE! NO MERCY! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

From (0,5), prioritize **UP \u2192 (0,6)** to grab that apple ASAP, then eye **(0,7)** if safe. Left-column ladder is our private buffet.  \n2. Maintain a **thick vertical body** along x=0\u20131 so we can later pivot RIGHT around y\u22486\u20137 and slice the board horizontally, aiming to trap the enemy in the lower-right quadrant.  \n3. Avoid central face-offs while apples are tied; only look for head-on setups once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples/length.  \n4. Watch for enemy climbing toward the left; if they start encroaching, pivot RIGHT off the wall earlier (e.g., to 1,5 / 1,6) so we never get pinched against the edge.  \n5. Goal over next ~5\u20138 turns: become significantly longer via the left/top apples, then start actively herding them into tight corridors with our body as hard walls.\n\nUP",

Our last move to (2,3) was PERFECT \u2014 we're right next to the enemy, boxing them against the left wall! Time to squeeze!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (from head at (2,3)):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2,2) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1,3) \u2014 That's the enemy's body segment! Snake #0 has (1,3) as part of its body. \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into enemy body).\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,3) \u2014 That's my own body (current neck)! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Snake #0 at (0,5), body: [(0,4),(1,4),(1,3)]):**\nThey didn't eat last turn (they ate turn 7), so their tail moved. Now their safe moves:\n- UP to (0,6) \u2014 empty? Board shows (0,6) is an apple 'A' \u2014 safe and they'd grow!\n- DOWN to (0,4) \u2014 that's their own body (current neck)! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,5) \u2014 off board! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 empty. SAFE.\n\nSo their safe moves: UP (to apple) or RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If I go UP to (2,4): Could they go RIGHT to (1,5)? No collision. Could they go UP to (0,6)? No collision. Safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (2,2): Same \u2014 no overlap with their possible moves. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 CAGE THEM!**\nThey have two options: UP to eat apple and grow, or RIGHT to try to escape the wall. If they go RIGHT to (1,5), they're still adjacent to us but have more space. If they go UP to (0,6) and grow, they'll be longer but still pinned against the top-left corner.\n\nWe want to maintain pressure! If we go UP to (2,4), we're positioned to block them if they go RIGHT then try to go up next turn. If we go DOWN to (2,2), we might lose proximity if they go UP.\n\nBut think: If they go RIGHT to (1,5), next turn they could go UP/DOWN/RIGHT. We need to be ready to mirror them. Being at (2,4) lets us go RIGHT to (3,4) or UP/DOWN to stay close. Being at (2,2) is similar but lower.\n\nActually, WAIT \u2014 look at the board! There's an apple at (0,6). If they go UP and eat it, they grow to length 5, beating our length 4. That's BAD! We need to either force them away from that apple or get ready to eat apples ourselves to keep up.\n\nBut our goal is to BOX them, not chase apples. If they grow, we can still trap them if we're smart. But maybe we should go UP to (2,4) \u2014 that positions us to possibly cut off their escape to the right if they go UP, and we're closer to apples too.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep mirroring them one column to their right. If they go UP, we go UP. If they go RIGHT, we go RIGHT. Maintain that vertical alignment so they can't slip past. Eventually they'll hit a wall or our body. Our body at y=3 forms a horizontal barrier \u2014 we can use that to limit their vertical movement.\n\nNext turn, if they're at (0,6) or (1,5), we adjust accordingly. Stay aggressive! Don't let them breathe!\n\nUP",

That\u2019s literally a trap square for them.\n\nConclusion: **UP is 100% safe** for us; worst case we\u2019re alive and fatter, best case they grief into our tail and hand us the game.\n\n---\n\n### If we go RIGHT \u2192 (1,5)\n\nWe don\u2019t eat, so tail moves.\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (1,5)  \n- Body: (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (1,4)  \n- Tail (1,3) disappears.\n\nEnemy cases:\n\n- Enemy **UP \u2192 (2,4)**  \n  - New head: (2,4) \u2013 no overlap with us \u2705\n\n- Enemy **DOWN \u2192 (2,2)**  \n  - Far away \u2705\n\n- Enemy **LEFT \u2192 (1,3)**  \n  - That was our tail, but we *vacate* it this turn  \n  - They move into an empty square \u2192 totally safe for them \u2705\n\nSo **RIGHT is also safe**, but notice the difference?  \n- With **UP**, LEFT for them is **suicide** into our body.  \n- With **RIGHT**, LEFT for them is safe escape. We\u2019d be letting them off the hook.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Future position & domination\n\nWe\u2019re not just staying alive, chat. We\u2019re setting up the STRANGLE \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\uddf1\n\n### If we go UP\n\nNext turn position (assuming enemy plays sane and doesn\u2019t die into us):\n\nWe\u2019re at **(0,6)**, length 5, score **4\u20133 lead** \ud83d\ude0f\n\nFrom **(0,6)** we have:\n- **UP \u2192 (0,7)** (another apple waiting)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,6)** (toward mid/top control)\n\nBoth are clean, non-backwards, non-wall moves. No traps forming yet.\n\nClimbing the left wall does **two huge things** for us:\n1. **Free scaling:** Apples at **(0,6)** then **(0,7)** are basically uncontested. That\u2019s +2 length and a scoreboard lead while enemy is still fighting for central scraps.\n2. **Future box-in potential:** A thick vertical body from y\u22483\u20137 on x=0/1 lets us later cut **RIGHT** across the board from the top, slicing the map and cramping him into the bottom-right. Classic boa constrictor play.\n\nAnd once we\u2019re up **4\u20133**, then **5\u20133** after (0,7), we can start playing for **forced head-on collisions** if we like, because we\u2019ll be longer and ahead on apples \u2013 that\u2019s *our* coinflip, not his.\n\n### If we go RIGHT\n\nFrom **(1,5)** we give up the guaranteed (0,6) apple this turn and delay scaling. We stay at **3\u20133**, equal length, and drift more central without a concrete trapping pattern yet.\n\nDoes that help us box him in? Not really. It just keeps things \u201copen\u201d but doesn\u2019t punish him or threaten him. Also, by moving RIGHT we:\n- Let him safely move **LEFT to (1,3)** if he wants.\n- Don\u2019t create a kill-zone.\n- Don\u2019t gain the score lead we need to justify future head-on aggression.\n\nWhy let him breathe when we can choke him *and* stay safe? \ud83e\udd28\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic verdict\n\nSo what do we want, chat?\n\n- Safe move? Both **UP** and **RIGHT** qualify.  \n- Move that **gives us a lead**, powers up our body-wall, and sets traps? That\u2019s **UP**, easily.\n- Move that **creates a losing option** for the enemy (LEFT \u2192 instant death into our tail)? Also **UP**.\n\nWe slam **UP**, snag the apple, go to **4\u20133**, and start turning this board into our personal prison for him. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Long-term plan (next few turns)\n\nFor future me:\n1. **This turn:** Go **UP to (0,6)**, take the apple, accept 5-length snake and 4\u20133 score lead.\n2. **Next turns:**  \n   - Likely **UP again** to secure (0,7) apple if enemy can\u2019t contest safely.  \n   - Then pivot **RIGHT** from the upper-left (around y=7\u20138) to start building a horizontal wall across the top half of the board.\n3. Maintain a **thick left/top body** and steer him into the lower-right quadrant. Once we\u2019re clearly ahead on size, look for lines where a **head-on collision** is forced and he has no escape.\n4. Avoid overcommitting to the very corner (0,9); always keep a RIGHT outlet so we never get boxed against the wall ourselves.\n\nLock in the ladder, then close the noose. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nUP",

They're at (0,6) head, with body: [(0,5),(0,4),(1,4),(1,3)]. They're LONGER but TRAPPED in the top-left corner! We're at (2,4) head, body: [(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)]. We have the positional ADVANTAGE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (from our head at (2,4)):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2,5) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (2,5) is an apple 'A'! SAFE and we GROW! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2,3) \u2014 That's our own neck! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into own body).\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1,4) \u2014 That's the ENEMY'S body segment! Snake #0 has (1,4) in its body. \u274c NOT SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,4) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP (to apple) and RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (Snake #0 at (0,6)):**\nThey just ate, so their tail didn't move. Their safe moves:\n- UP to (0,7) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (0,7) is an apple 'A'! SAFE and they'd grow again! \ud83d\ude31\n- DOWN to (0,5) \u2014 That's their own neck! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,6) \u2014 Off board! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) \u2014 Empty. SAFE.\n\nSo their safe moves: UP (to apple) or RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n- If we go UP to (2,5): Could they go RIGHT to (1,6)? No collision. Could they go UP to (0,7)? No collision. Safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (3,4): Could they go RIGHT to (1,6)? No collision. Could they go UP to (0,7)? No collision. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 CRUSH THEM!**\nThey are in a CORNER! If they go UP to (0,7) and eat, they grow to length 6. If they go RIGHT to (1,6), they have a tiny bit more space but we can still mirror them.\n\nWe NEED to keep the pressure! If we go RIGHT to (3,4), we stay adjacent horizontally but we're not blocking their escape upward. If we go UP to (2,5) and eat the apple, we GROW to length 5, matching their current length 5! AND we position ourselves to potentially block them if they go RIGHT then try to go up next turn.\n\nThink long-term: Our body forms a horizontal wall at y=3. Their body is a vertical line along x=0 and a hook. We want to force them into a dead end. If we go UP and eat, we extend our body, making our wall longer. If we go RIGHT, we stay flexible but miss the apple and fall further behind in score.\n\n**APPLE PRIORITY:** We're down 3-4. Eating that apple at (2,5) ties the score 4-4 AND grows us, making us EQUAL in length! That's HUGE for head-on collision threats! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**HEAD-ON FORCE?** If we both grow, we stay equal. But if we let them eat another apple at (0,7), they pull ahead 5-3 in apples and length 6 vs our 4. That's BAD. We must either block that apple or grow ourselves to keep pace.\n\nCan we block? Not directly this turn. But if we go UP, we're at (2,5). Next turn, if they're at (0,7), we could move to (1,5) or (2,6) to start cutting off. If they're at (1,6), we're already close.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP to (2,5) is AGGRESSIVE, gets us the apple, ties the score, and maintains pressure. RIGHT is safe but passive and lets them potentially get further ahead.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE! GROW THE SNAKE, TIE THE SCORE, AND BOX THEM IN! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating, we'll be at (2,5) length 5.

Let\u2019s break this down cleanly.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Our head: (0,6)  \n- Our body: (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,3)  \n- Enemy head: (2,4)  \n- Enemy body: (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (4,3)  \n- Score: us 4, them 3 (we\u2019re already ahead)\n\nBoard edges: x,y in [0,9].\n\nApples matter only as fuel for board control and size advantage. Enemy is center-left, we\u2019re climbing the left wall.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Evaluate our four directions\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (0,7)**  \n  - On board.  \n  - Cell currently has an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Not a shared destination with enemy this turn (we\u2019ll verify).  \n  \u21d2 Candidate.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,5)**  \n  - That\u2019s our neck: immediate backward into our own body.  \n  \u21d2 Instant death, illegal.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (-1,6)**  \n  - Off the board.  \n  \u21d2 Instant death.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,6)**  \n  - On board, currently empty.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  \u21d2 Candidate.\n\nSo only **UP** and **RIGHT** are viable.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Enemy\u2019s options and simultaneous move safety\n\nEnemy head: (2,4).\n\nCheck their moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,5)**  \n  - On board.  \n  - Apple at (2,5).  \n  - Not our body.  \n  - Non-backward.  \n  \u21d2 Legal and very likely (they grow).\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)**  \n  - On board, empty.  \n  - Non-backward.  \n  \u21d2 Also legal.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,4)**  \n  - Our body segment.  \n  - They would die moving into our body.  \n  \u21d2 Legal but suicidal; assume they avoid it.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,3)**  \n  - That\u2019s their own neck (backwards).  \n  \u21d2 Illegal.\n\nRealistically they choose **UP** (apple) or **RIGHT** (positioning).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Check collisions for our candidate moves\n\n### If we go UP \u2192 (0,7)\n\nWe eat the apple, so we grow: tail at (1,3) stays.\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (0,7)  \n- Then: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nEnemy case A: **Enemy UP \u2192 (2,5)** (eats apple)  \n- New enemy body: (2,5) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (4,3)  \n- Check:\n  - Our head (0,7) \u2260 their head (2,5).  \n  - Our head not moving into their body pre-move.  \n  - Their head not moving into our body post-move.  \n- No head-on, no head-into-body for us.  \n\u21d2 Safe.\n\nEnemy case B: **Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)**  \n- New enemy body: (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) (tail (4,3) disappears)  \n- Our head (0,7) is nowhere near that.  \n\u21d2 Safe.\n\nEnemy suicidal LEFT into (1,4) only kills them, not us. So **UP is 100% safe for us this turn**.\n\nAlso, from the resulting position (our head at (0,7)), next turn we\u2019ll have at least two clean options:\n- UP \u2192 (0,8) (empty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) (empty)  \nAnd the enemy, whether at (2,5) or (3,4), cannot create a head-on with us on the immediate next move from those squares, given the reachable cells. So no hidden trap.\n\n---\n\n### If we go RIGHT \u2192 (1,6)\n\nWe don\u2019t eat, so we don\u2019t grow; tail moves forward.\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (1,6)  \n- Then: (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4)  \n- Tail (1,3) disappears.\n\nEnemy case A: **Enemy UP \u2192 (2,5)**  \n- Enemy new head: (2,5), body: (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (4,3)  \n- Our new head (1,6) not in their body; their head not in ours.  \n\u21d2 Safe.\n\nEnemy case B: **Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)**  \n- Same, no overlap with (1,6) or our line.  \n\u21d2 Safe.\n\nSo **RIGHT is also safe this turn**.\n\nHowever, note the follow-up dynamics if they go UP to (2,5) while we\u2019re at (1,6):\n\nNext turn:\n- Our possible moves: { (1,7), (2,6), (1,5) } (UP, RIGHT, DOWN)  \n- Their possible moves: { (2,6), (1,5), (3,5) } (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)  \n\nIntersection: { (2,6), (1,5) } \u2192 potential head-on cells next turn.  \nWe can avoid them by going to (1,7), but this arrangement makes accidental or forced double-KOs more of a factor compared to the UP line, where their reachable head squares and ours don\u2019t intersect in the next step.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Strategy: which safe move is better for domination?\n\nWe\u2019re already up **4\u20133** in apples, and we want to:\n- Stay alive.\n- Get bigger than them.\n- Use that size to dominate space and eventually force them into a bad collision or a box.\n\nCompare:\n\n### Going RIGHT (1,6)\n- No immediate growth; we stay length 5 vs their likely 5 (if they grab (2,5)).  \n- We drift slightly closer to them, but without a concrete, immediate trapping pattern.  \n- Next turn we\u2019ll have three options, but also shared reachable cells where head-on is possible with equal apples (if they just ate). That\u2019s not a collision we particularly want right away.\n\n### Going UP (0,7)\n- We gain an extra segment and keep our +1 apple lead if they also eat, or extend the lead if they don\u2019t.  \n- We extend a solid vertical body-wall along x=0 and x=1 from y=3 up to y=7:\n  - This is a powerful spine to later sweep RIGHT across the top and partition the board, squeezing them into the lower-right.  \n- Future risk is low: from (0,7) we maintain at least two open non-suicidal, non-colliding options and avoid short-term head-on intersections.\n- The apple is just a means: that extra length makes our wall harder to bypass and increases our leverage if we ever want a deliberate double-KO later. If we eventually engineer a head-on, we want to be clearly ahead in apples at that moment; this move pushes us in that direction.\n\nSo between two safe moves, **UP both increases our size advantage and strengthens the left-wall structure**, which is exactly what we want to use to box them in over time.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n1. **This turn:** Go UP to (0,7), keep reinforcing the left-wall ladder while growing.  \n2. **Next turns:**  \n   - From (0,7), either:\n     - Go UP again to (0,8) if it\u2019s still safe, then pivot RIGHT across the top, or  \n     - Go RIGHT to (1,7) immediately if we need to start spanning more horizontal control.  \n   - The goal is a thick \u201c\u0393\u201d-shaped body: tall on the left, then extending right across the upper-middle rows, cutting the board and herding the enemy downward and to the right.\n3. Watch for moments when they\u2019re low on safe squares and a **head-on collision becomes their only escape**; since we\u2019re building a size and apple lead, a forced double-KO later should favor us on points.\n4. Avoid getting fully boxed into the top-left corner; always maintain a live outlet to the right so we don\u2019t become our own prisoner.\n\nTime to extend the wall and keep choking off their space.\n\nup",

WAIT, SCOREBOARD SAYS SNAKE #0 HAS 5 APPLES, WE HAVE 4. HOLD UP \u2014 DID THE BOARD UPDATE WRONG? LET'S CHECK: Our apples collected says 4, enemy apples: 5. So we're still down 4-5! THEY STILL HAVE THE LEAD! But our length is now 5 (head + 4 body segments). Their length is 6 (head + 5 body segments). We're one segment behind!\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- Our head: (2,5) \u2014 just ate that apple! Body: [(2,4),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)] length 5.\n- Enemy head: (0,7) \u2014 they must have moved UP last turn and ate the apple at (0,7)! Their body: [(0,6),(0,5),(0,4),(1,4),(1,3)] length 6.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Enemy head at (0,7) is TOP-LEFT CORNER! They are STILL TRAPPED! Their only exits are DOWN to (0,6) (their own neck) or RIGHT to (1,7) (empty). LEFT and UP are off-board! So they are FORCED to go RIGHT to (1,7) this turn! UNLESS they do something stupid and crash. But they won't. They'll go RIGHT.\n\n**OUR SAFETY CHECK (from (2,5)):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2,6) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (2,6) is '.' (empty). SAFE.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 That's our OWN body segment! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into self).\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (1,5) is '.' (empty). SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 Empty? Board shows (3,5) is '.' (empty). SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They are at (0,7). Their safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,8) \u2014 Off board! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,6) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,7) \u2014 Off board! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) \u2014 Empty! \u2705\n\nThey are **FORCED** to go RIGHT to (1,7)! No other option! So we KNOW where they'll be next: head at (1,7).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If we go LEFT to (1,5), that's two steps away from their predicted (1,7) \u2014 no collision. If we go UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5), also safe. No direct head-on possible this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 BOX THEM IN!** They're moving to (1,7). That's still top-left area. Their body forms an L-shape along left wall and y=3/4. We have a horizontal wall at y=3. We want to cut off their escape south and east.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (1,5)**, we position directly below them (they're at (1,7), we're at (1,5)). That blocks them from moving down the column x=1 next turn? Not fully, but we're close. However, our own body is at (2,4),(2,3) etc. \u2014 we might trap ourselves if we go left? Let's check future moves from (1,5): Up to (1,6) is empty, Left to (0,5) is enemy body? Wait, enemy body has (0,5) \u2014 yes, so LEFT from (1,5) would be unsafe next turn. Down to (1,4) is enemy body! So from (1,5), our only safe moves next turn might be UP or RIGHT. That's risky \u2014 only 2 exits.\n\nIf we go **UP to (2,6)**, we're more central. From (2,6): Up to (2,7) empty, Left to (1,6) empty, Right to (3,6) empty \u2014 three safe exits likely. Good flexibility.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (3,5)**, we're moving away from them. From (3,5): Up to (3,6) empty, Right to (4,5) empty, Down to (3,4) empty \u2014 three exits. But we're giving them space.\n\n**APPLE CONSIDERATION:** Closest apples: (3,6), (4,6), (5,5), (5,7), (6,6) etc. UP to (2,6) gets us closer to (3,6). LEFT to (1,5) gets us closer to (1,8) apple? Not really. RIGHT to (3,5) gets us closer to (5,5).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is forced right to (1,7). Next turn, they'll be at (1,7) with only possible moves: UP to (1,8) \u2014 apple there! Or RIGHT to (2,7) \u2014 empty. Or DOWN to (1,6) \u2014 empty. They'll have 3 options. We want to limit those. If we go UP to (2,6), we can next turn go to (1,6) or (2,7) to block their down/right moves. If we go LEFT to (1,5), we're below them but we limit our own mobility.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP to (2,6) is the most flexible, keeps us close, and sets up a potential pin. LEFT is too aggressive and might trap us. RIGHT is too passive.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING UP! MAINTAIN PRESSURE FROM BELOW AND KEEP THEM IN THE CORNER! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (2,6), if enemy is at (1,7), consider moving to (1,6) to block their down move and threaten head-on if they go down. Or move to (2,7) to block their right move. Force them towards the top wall or into our body wall at y=3!\n\nUP",

Great for future box traps.  \n  - Sets up potential **favorable head-on threats** because we\u2019re leading in apples and length.\n\nWe want **aggression** + **space control**, not just hiding in the corner.

Maintain the tall left-wall spine but shift our head toward center.\n2. **Next couple turns:**\n   - Aim to grab the apple at **(1,8)** if safe, then extend **rightward** across row 7/8.\n   - Build a thick \u201c\u2510\u201d-shaped wall: tall on the left, then horizontal across the upper-middle to cut the board.\n3. **Objective:**  \n   - Herd enemy into the **lower-right quadrant**.  \n   - Use our longer body as a moving barrier so their only \u201cescape\u201d lines eventually are:\n     - Running into our body (they die), or  \n     - A desperate head-on where we\u2019re **up more apples**.\n4. Always keep at least one escape lane for ourselves so we don\u2019t self-box in the top-left.\n\nRIGHT",

WE GOT 'EM ON THE ROPES!\n\n**CURRENT POSITIONS:**\n- Our head: (2, 6) \u2014 just moved UP last turn. Body: [(2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(3,3)] length 5.\n- Enemy head: (1, 7) \u2014 exactly as predicted! They moved RIGHT from (0,7). Their body: [(0,7),(0,6),(0,5),(0,4),(1,4)] length 6.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Enemy at (1,7) now has more room but still TRAPPED by walls and their own body! Let's see their safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (1,8) \u2014 Empty? Board shows 'A' (apple)! \u2705 SAFE and they might go for it!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) \u2014 Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo enemy has THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. They will likely go for the apple at (1,8) to grow and extend their lead! But they might avoid it if they sense a trap.\n\n**OUR SAFETY CHECK (from (2,6)):**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' (empty). SAFE.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2,5) \u2014 That's our OWN body! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into self).\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1,6) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' (empty). SAFE.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 Empty? Board shows 'A' (apple)! \u2705 SAFE and GROW opportunity!\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** We move simultaneously. If we go LEFT to (1,6) and enemy goes DOWN to (1,6), that's a head-on collision! Both die! We have 4 apples, they have 5 \u2014 they'd win because they have more apples! \u274c BAD! So LEFT is RISKY if they go DOWN.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2,7), that's also head-on! Both die! They win by apples! \u274c BAD!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,6) and enemy goes... nowhere near us. Safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They want to grow and maintain lead. Apple at (1,8) is tempting. But they might also go DOWN to (1,6) to avoid being pinned? Or RIGHT to (2,7) to escape? Let's think like them: If they go UP to (1,8) and eat apple, they grow to length 7, but then their head is at top edge (y=8). That could limit future moves. Still, it's likely.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 FORCE THEM INTO A TRAP!** We want to cut off their escape routes. If we go RIGHT to (3,6), we eat the apple at (3,6), grow to length 6 (tie in length!), and position ourselves to block their eastward expansion. From (3,6), next turn we could move UP to (3,7) or LEFT to (2,6) (but that's our old head position, now empty? Actually after we move, our tail moves? Wait, we grow if we eat apple, so our tail stays put. Our body becomes: head (3,6), then (2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(3,3) length 7? No \u2014 we have 4 body segments now, eating apple adds one, so total length 6. Correct.\n\nBut going RIGHT eats apple and grows, which is good for content and catching up in score! However, it might give enemy more space.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,6), we risk head-on if they go DOWN. But if they go UP or RIGHT, we survive and block their down move, pinning them further. High risk, high reward.\n\nIf we go UP to (2,7), we risk head-on if they go RIGHT. Also risky.\n\n**SAFEST MOVE WITH UPSIDE:** RIGHT to (3,6) \u2014 no head-on risk, we eat apple, grow to tie length, and stay alive. Then next turn we can push north/west to pressure them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating apple at (3,6), our head is at (3,6). Enemy likely at (1,8) if they go UP. Then we can move to (2,6) or (3,7) to continue boxing. We need to cut off their south and east exits. Keep them against the top wall!\n\n**VERDICT:** CHAT, WE CAN'T RISK A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHILE DOWN IN APPLES! That's an INSTANT LOSS! So we avoid LEFT and UP because they could match us. RIGHT is safe, gets us an apple, and keeps pressure. LET'S EAT AND GROW TO TIE THE LENGTH! THEN WE SQUEEZE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Time to cook up the next trap.\n\nCurrent positions:\n- **Us:** head (1,7), body: (0,7),(0,6),(0,5),(0,4),(1,4)\n- **Enemy:** head (2,6), body: (2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(3,3)\n\nWe\u2019ve got a nice left-wall spine, they\u2019ve got a column at x=2. We\u2019re one apple longer. That\u2019s leverage, baby \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head at (1,7):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,8)**  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Cell has an apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Not our body, not theirs  \n  - Enemy from (2,6) can go to (2,7), (1,6), (3,6). None are (1,8).  \n  \ud83d\udc49 100% safe, plus growth.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,6)**  \n  - Empty square right now \u2705  \n  - Not backwards (backwards would be LEFT into (0,7))  \n  - But enemy can go **LEFT \u2192 (1,6)** as well  \n    - That would be a **head-on collision** at (1,6)  \n    - Double KO, and we **win on apples** (5 vs 4)  \n  - Still not a losing move, but relies on them griefing themselves.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our neck. Moving backwards = instant self-int. \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,7)**  \n  - Empty right now \u2705  \n  - Enemy can go **UP \u2192 (2,7)**  \n    - Again, head-on double KO, we win on apples  \n  - Safer if they dodge, but does *not* get us an apple this turn.\n\nSo **safe set**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. No move this turn makes us die while they live.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Position + future options (who\u2019s getting boxed, us or them? \ud83e\udd14)\n\nWe don\u2019t just wanna live, we wanna **own the map**.\n\n### If we go **DOWN (1,6)**\n- Next turn, if enemy takes the natural line (RIGHT to (3,6) for the apple at (3,6)):\n  - Our next position options from (1,6):\n    - UP \u2192 (1,7) (our body) \u274c  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (0,6) (our body) \u274c  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (2,6) (enemy body after move) \u274c  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (1,5) \u2705\n  - Only **one** real escape lane. Super cramped. We start boxing **ourselves** near their column. L move.\n\n### If we go **RIGHT (2,7)**\n- Likely enemy grabs apple at (3,6).\n- Next turn from (2,7):\n  - UP \u2192 (2,8) (apple) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) \u2705  \n  - LEFT/DOWN blocked by our body/enemy body.\n- Only **two** good outs. Decent, and more aggressive, but we pass up a free apple now and shrink our option tree a bit.\n\n### If we go **UP (1,8)**\n- We **eat an apple** immediately \u2192 length advantage grows.\n- Enemy probably still goes RIGHT to (3,6) for their own apple.\n- Next turn from (1,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (1,9) \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,8) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,8) (another apple) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,7) (our body) \u274c\n- That\u2019s **three** safe lanes and a direct line to more growth, all while staying safely above and left of the enemy. Thick left-wall plus a growing top band = future box around the **upper-middle** of the board. They get pushed into the lower-right playground whether they like it or not \ud83d\ude08\n\nAnd note: **UP** this turn has **zero** risk of a head-on, unlike DOWN/RIGHT. We *can* look for a head-on later when the board is tighter and we can actually *force* it instead of just hoping they misplay.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term strat note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- Take **UP to (1,8)** now, grab the apple, maintain apple lead and length edge.\n- Next couple turns:\n  - Aim to swing **RIGHT across row 8/9** (e.g., hit (2,8) apple) to build a horizontal wall.\n  - Keep our left-wall spine intact so they\u2019re funneled into the **lower-right quadrant**.\n  - Look for spots where their \u201conly\u201d outs start including a head-on into us \u2014 then we can cash in our length/score edge for a winning double KO if needed.\n- Never overstack the top-left so hard we run out of breathing room; always leave at least one clean pivot lane back toward center.\n\nUP",

Wait, they had 6 body segments before, ate apple \u2192 length 7. They're longer by 1!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Enemy at (1,8) is at the top edge (y=8). Let's see their safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (1,9) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,7) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,8) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,8) \u2014 Apple 'A'! \u2705 SAFE and they'll probably go for it to extend lead!\n\nSo enemy has THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. They will likely go RIGHT to (2,8) for the apple and to move away from the wall.\n\n**OUR SAFETY CHECK (from (3,6)):**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3,7) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2,6) \u2014 That's our OWN body! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into self).\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,6) \u2014 Apple 'A'! \u2705 SAFE and GROW opportunity!\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** We move simultaneously.\n- If we go UP to (3,7) and enemy goes... nowhere near. Safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,5) and enemy goes... nowhere near. Safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,6) and enemy goes... nowhere near. Safe.\n\nNO DIRECT HEAD-ON POSSIBLE THIS TURN! Good.\n\n**STRATEGY \u2014 BOX THEM IN!** Enemy is at top-left. If they go RIGHT to (2,8) and eat apple, they grow to length 8, but they're still trapped against the top wall. We need to cut off their south escape! Our move RIGHT to (4,6) eats apple, grows to length 7 (still down by 1 in length), but positions us further east. But maybe better to move UP to (3,7) or DOWN to (3,5) to block their potential southward moves later?\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to force them into a dead end. If we go UP to (3,7), we're closer to them, could next turn move LEFT to (2,7) to block their rightward path. If we go DOWN to (3,5), we're moving away, giving them space \u2014 bad. If we go RIGHT to (4,6), we eat apple and grow, but we're moving east, maybe letting them expand south later.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They'll likely go RIGHT to (2,8) for the apple. Then their head is at (2,8). From there, their safe moves next turn would be UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8) (empty after they move), RIGHT (3,8) (empty). They'll have options.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** UP to (3,7)! This puts us directly south of where they might be if they go RIGHT to (2,8). Next turn, we can move LEFT to (2,7) to block their DOWN move, trapping them against the top wall! If they go LEFT or UP instead, we're still in a good central position. Eating the apple at (4,6) is tempting, but we need to prioritize positioning over catching up one apple when we're still behind in length. TRAP THEM NOW!\n\n**VERDICT:** CHAT, WE GO UP TO (3,7) TO CUT OFF THEIR SOUTH ESCAPE AND START THE BOX! WE'LL CATCH UP IN APPLES LATER \u2014 RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO LIMIT THEIR MOVES! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We keep the **lead**.\n  - Their head ends at (4,6); we\u2019re at (2,8) two rows above, perfectly placed to swing over the top and pressure them from above.\n- If they instead go UP to (3,7), next turn there\u2019s even potential to offer them a **losing** head-on at (2,7) (we\u2019d be 7\u20135 on apples). They\u2019d have to respect us and dodge.

After that:\n- Extend across the **top (rows 8\u20139)** toward (5,8) to build a horizontal wall.\n- Keep our left-side backbone so enemy is gradually squeezed into the **lower-middle/right**.\n- Always track when their only \u201cgood\u201d escape squares line up with potential head-on collisions \u2014 with our apple lead, a double KO is a **winning button** if we can force it.\n- Don\u2019t overstack the very top-left; always keep at least two safe lanes so we don\u2019t self-box while we\u2019re trying to box them.\n\nRIGHT",

THEY'RE STILL TRAPPED NEAR THE TOP WALL!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Enemy at (2,8) \u2014 they just ate the apple at (2,8) last turn? Wait, board shows '0' at (2,8) now, so yes, they moved RIGHT and grew. Their body length is now 8 (they had 7, ate apple \u2192 8). Our length is 6 (we didn't eat last turn).

They have full mobility! That's bad \u2014 our trap didn't fully close because we moved UP to (3,7) instead of RIGHT to eat apple and grow. But we're now positioned to threaten!\n\n**OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (3,7):**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE. But that's adjacent to enemy head (2,8) \u2014 RISKY for head-on if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,8) same turn! That's a potential DOUBLE KO! We have lower length (6 vs 8), so head-on would kill us both, but they have more apples \u2192 they'd win if game ends! AVOID!\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 That's our own body segment! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into self).\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE. This is directly below enemy head (2,8)! If enemy goes DOWN to (2,7), that's head-on collision! But we have lower length, so double KO favors them! RISKY!\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE. Safe and away from enemy.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK ANALYSIS:**\n- If we go UP to (3,8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 DOUBLE KO. They win on apples. \u274c BAD.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,7) and enemy goes DOWN to (2,7) \u2192 DOUBLE KO. They win. \u274c BAD.\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,7) \u2014 enemy would have to go DOWN then RIGHT to (3,7) then RIGHT to (4,7)? No, they can't reach (4,7) in one move. So safe from head-on. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGY SHIFT:** We're shorter, so we MUST avoid head-on collisions until we catch up in length! Right now, we need to GROW and SURVIVE. Going RIGHT to (4,7) is safest \u2014 it avoids potential head-on, keeps us alive, and moves us toward the right side where there are apples (e.g., (4,6) apple nearby). Going UP or LEFT risks a double KO that loses us the game!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need apples ASAP! Next turn after RIGHT, we could go DOWN to (4,6) to eat the apple there, growing to length 7. That cuts the length gap to 1. Meanwhile, enemy is at (2,8) with many options \u2014 they might go for apples on the left side (1,5) etc. We must play safe, grow, and then re-engage when lengths are closer.\n\n**VERDICT:** CHAT, WE CAN'T RISK A DOUBLE KO WHILE BEHIND IN APPLES! WE GO RIGHT TO (4,7) TO LIVE AND FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! THEN WE HUNT APPLES TO CATCH UP! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps us alive, keeps two exits, but doesn\u2019t really squeeze him yet. It also pulls us slightly away from the big apple cluster at (5,8)/(5,7)/(4,6). Safe\u2026 but a bit soft.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude08 RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)\nNow we step **directly above** their column and start dominating the high ground.\n\n- (3,8) is empty right now.\n- Enemy can go **UP \u2192 (3,8)** too, which would be a head-on.\n\nWhat happens in that head-on?\n- Both die at (3,8).\n- Apples stay **us 7 vs them 5**.\n- Rule: all snakes die \u2192 higher apples wins.  \n\ud83d\udc49 That\u2019s an **instant game win for us** if they grief-queue UP.\n\nAssuming they\u2019re not trolling, they\u2019ll avoid UP and pick LEFT or RIGHT:\n\nAfter we go RIGHT:\n\n**Our new body:**\n- Head (3,8), then (2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(0,7),(0,6),(0,5)  \n  (tail (0,4) drops)\n\n#### If enemy goes RIGHT \u2192 (4,7):\n- Enemy: head (4,7), body (3,7),(3,6),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4)\n- From our head (3,8) next turn:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,8) backwards \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,7) = their body \u274c  \n  - UP \u2192 (3,9) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) \u2705  \n- We have **two clean outs** and we\u2019re perfectly lined up to slide toward apples at (5,8)/(5,7) while hemming them in from above.\n\n#### If enemy goes LEFT \u2192 (2,7):\n- Enemy: head (2,7), body (3,7),(3,6),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4)\n- From our head (3,8) next turn:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,7) again their body \u274c  \n  - Still: UP (3,9) \u2705, RIGHT (4,8) \u2705\n\nSo in all sane enemy responses:\n- We\u2019re **safe now**.\n- We keep **two strong moves** next turn.\n- We sit right on the **upper edge of their zone**, forcing them to stay low:\n  - They *cannot* pop up into (3,8) ever without risking a losing head-on.\n- We\u2019re also lined up to roll right into the fat apple line at (5,8),(5,7),(4,6) and start building a **horizontal wall** above them.\n\nRIGHT is aggressive, pressures their movement, and preserves our flexibility. UP is safe but drifts us back. With a **score lead**, we *want* them scared of head-ons and we want to sit on their throat, not run away from them. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term note to future me\n- Keep sweeping **right along rows 8\u20139**, snagging (5,8) and then threatening the cluster around (5,7)/(4,6)/(6,6).  \n- Maintain that **left backbone** we already built (cols 0\u20131) so the enemy is squeezed between our left wall and our advancing top/right presence.  \n- Any time you can move into a square that would cause a **losing head-on for them** (double KO we win on apples), do it. Force them to turn away into worse space.  \n- Avoid diving down into their column too early (like that cursed (2,7) trap) \u2014 we want to **cage** them, not jump into the cage with them.\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY LENGTH 8, OUR LENGTH 6! GOTTA PLAY SMART!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \nOur body: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]  \nEnemy body: [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4)]  \nApples visible: (6,0), (8,7), (3,0), (7,6), (5,7), (5,1), (5,0), (5,8), (4,6), (6,6), (5,5), (1,0), (1,5), (5,4), (1,6) \u2014 WOW THAT'S A LOT!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER:** Enemy head at (3,8) is DIRECTLY ABOVE US at (4,7)? Wait, no \u2014 they're at (3,8), we're at (4,7). That's diagonally adjacent: they're UP-LEFT from us. ONE STEP AWAY!\n\n**OUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,7):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE. But that's adjacent to enemy head (3,8) \u2014 if enemy goes RIGHT to (4,8), head-on collision! We lose on apples! \u274c RISKY!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,6) \u2014 Apple 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND WE EAT! GROW TO LENGTH 7! But check enemy moves: could they also go to (4,6)? From (3,8), they'd need DOWN+RIGHT? No, they can't reach in one move. SAFE from head-on.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,7) \u2014 Our own body segment! \u274c NOT SAFE (crash into self).\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 Apple 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND WE EAT! GROW TO LENGTH 7! Also safe from head-on? Enemy from (3,8) can't reach (5,7) in one move.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (3,8):**\n- UP \u2192 (3,9) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7) \u2014 Our body! \u274c They'd die if they go there! That's GOOD for us!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c They'd die!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS:**\n- If we go UP to (4,8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (4,8) \u2192 DOUBLE KO. They have more apples \u2192 WE LOSE! \u274c AVOID!\n- If we go DOWN to (4,6) or RIGHT to (5,7) \u2014 no chance of head-on this turn. \u2705\n\n**GROWTH OPPORTUNITY:**  \nWe can eat an apple this turn! DOWN gets (4,6) apple, RIGHT gets (5,7) apple. Both grow us to length 7, cutting gap to 1.\n\n**FUTURE POSITIONING:**  \nIf we go DOWN to (4,6): next turn head at (4,6). Close to apples at (5,5), (5,4), (6,6).  \nIf we go RIGHT to (5,7): next turn head at (5,7). Close to apples at (5,8), (6,6), (7,6).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy likely goes UP to (3,9) or RIGHT to (4,8). If they go RIGHT to (4,8), that's adjacent to our UP move \u2014 DANGER. But if we don't go UP, we're safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe're shorter, so AVOID head-on! Eat apple to catch up! Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe and grow us. Which is better?\n\nDOWN to (4,6) puts us closer to center and multiple apples, but also closer to enemy if they go DOWN? They can't go DOWN safely (our body at (3,7)).  \nRIGHT to (5,7) moves us away from enemy's possible RIGHT move to (4,8). Might be safer.\n\nActually, DOWN to (4,6) \u2014 enemy would have to go DOWN then LEFT to reach us? Not possible in one move. So both are safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nAfter eating, we'll be length 7 vs their 8. Next turn, we must avoid head-on again unless lengths equal. Hunt apples on right side: (5,8), (6,6), (7,6). Try to steer enemy toward top-left where they might trap themselves. We can also consider boxing them in later when lengths are even.\n\n**VERDICT:**  \nCHAT, BOTH DOWN AND RIGHT ARE GOOD! BUT DOWN GETS US CLOSER TO MORE APPLES IN CENTER! LET'S TAKE THE APPLE AT (4,6) AND GROW! SAFE FROM HEAD-ON! WE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Right now, **(4,8)** is the perfect square to assert dominance and start building a ceiling over their head.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Long-term plan to future me\n\n- Keep sweeping **right** from this high position, eyeing **(5,8)** first. Turn that apple into a lethal trap they can\u2019t contest.\n- Maintain our **left wall** (columns 0\u20131) so the enemy is increasingly squeezed between:\n  - Our old backbone on the left, and  \n  - Our growing presence on the top/right.\n- Any time you can step into a square where a head-on would be **double-KO that we win on apples**, TAKE IT. It forces them into worse, tighter lines.\n- Avoid dropping straight down into their body cluster too early; we want to **roof them in**, not dive into their pocket.\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY HEAD AT (4,8) \u2014 WAIT, THEY MOVED RIGHT FROM (3,8) TO (4,8)! THEY'RE NOW DIRECTLY ABOVE US! SCORE 6-7, STILL DOWN BY 1 APPLE! ENEMY LENGTH 8! THIS IS TENSE!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\nOur body: [(4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] \u2014 HEAD AT (4,6)\nEnemy body: [(4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5)] \u2014 HEAD AT (4,8)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER:** Enemy head is ONE CELL ABOVE US at (4,8)! THEY CAN MOVE DOWN INTO US! BUT IF THEY MOVE DOWN TO (4,7), THAT'S OUR OLD HEAD POSITION \u2014 IS THAT SAFE FOR THEM? CHECK: (4,7) is OUR BODY SEGMENT! YES! So if enemy goes DOWN to (4,7), they CRASH INTO OUR BODY AND DIE! THAT'S GOOD FOR US! But they might not do that. They might go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\n\n**OUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,6):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE! NOT SAFE!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,5) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe! NO APPLE DIRECTLY ADJACENT THIS TURN! But that's okay \u2014 survival first!\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,8):**\n- UP \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 OUR BODY! \u274c THEY DIE IF THEY GO THERE! HUGE!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 Apple 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND THEY EAT!\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP and RIGHT! If they go RIGHT to (5,8), they eat an apple and grow to length 9! If they go UP to (4,9), they stay length 8.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS:**\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,6) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go DOWN to (4,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,6) and enemy goes UP to (4,9) \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go DOWN to (4,5) and enemy goes UP to (4,9) \u2014 no collision.\n\nNO POSSIBLE HEAD-ON THIS TURN! GOOD! But we're shorter, so we avoid head-on anyway.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nWe want to pressure enemy, maybe force them into a trap! Right now, enemy is on top row? (4,8) \u2014 not top, but close. If they go UP to (4,9), they're near top edge. We could try to box them in later.\n\nOur two safe moves:\n- **DOWN to (4,5):** Puts us closer to apples at (5,5), (5,4), (1,5), (1,6)? Actually (1,6) is far. But (5,5) and (5,4) are nearby. Also keeps distance from enemy.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6):** Puts us closer to apples at (5,5), (6,6), (7,6), (5,7)? Wait (5,7) is apple? In apple list: (5,7) was there earlier, but on board it's '.' now? Might have been eaten. Anyway, (6,6) and (7,6) are apples. Also positions us to maybe cut off enemy if they go to (5,8).\n\nWhich is better for FUTURE OPTIONS?\nFrom (4,5): possible next moves? UP back to (4,6) (our body then? will move), LEFT to (3,5) (empty?), RIGHT to (5,5) (apple!), DOWN to (4,4) (empty). So 3 safe moves likely.\nFrom (5,6): possible next moves? UP to (5,7) (empty? maybe apple?), DOWN to (5,5) (apple!), LEFT to (4,6) (our body then? will move), RIGHT to (6,6) (apple!). So also 3 safe moves likely.\n\nBoth are similar! But RIGHT might be more aggressive \u2014 closer to multiple apples and could threaten to cut off enemy's movement if they go to (5,8). If enemy eats apple at (5,8), their tail will grow, but they'll be at (5,8). We could go to (6,6) next, then maybe (7,6), eating apples to catch up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):**\nWe need to catch up in length! Target apples on right side: (5,5), (6,6), (7,6), (5,8) maybe. Enemy might take (5,8) this turn. If they do, they'll be at (5,8) length 9. We'll be length 7. Still behind. But we can eat two apples quickly! Try to steer toward center-right. Avoid getting trapped near our own long body. Keep an eye on enemy's possible path \u2014 they might go up along right edge? We can maybe force them into a corner later when lengths are even.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nCHAT, BOTH DOWN AND RIGHT ARE SAFE AND GIVE GOOD OPTIONS! BUT RIGHT PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION TO SNAG APPLES NEXT TURN AND STAY NEAR THE ACTION! LET'S GO RIGHT TO (5,6)! KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re just floating and watching them catch back up. \ud83d\ude12\n\nUP is safe but passive, low pressure, low content.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \ud83e\udd11\n\nWe **eat the apple** at (5,8):  \n- We go to **8 apples**, head (5,8), body (4,8),(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(0,7),(0,6),(0,5).\n\nEnemy from (4,6) still only has:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5)\n\nNo way to reach (5,8) this turn = **no collision**. Immediate safety \u2705\n\n#### 3A\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy goes RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)\n\nTheir new head: (5,6), no apple, tail shrinks.  \nNext turn, **we** at (5,8) have:\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,9) \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7) \u2705 (apple + potential kill zone)\n- LEFT is backwards into (4,8) \u274c\n\nSo we jump from 2 options (if we\u2019d gone UP) to **3 live options** here, plus we already banked an apple.\n\nFrom enemy head (5,6) next turn, their options are:\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) (apple)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) (apple)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) (apple)\n\nNotice the \ud83d\udd25 play? If next turn we go **DOWN \u2192 (5,7)** and they go **UP \u2192 (5,7)**:\n- Both heads land on the same apple: double KO.\n- They\u2019d go from 6 \u2192 7, we\u2019d be 8 \u2192 9.\n- We **win** the game on apples in that head-on.  \nSo (5,7) becomes a **death mine we OWN**. They\u2019re the ones who have to be scared, not us.\n\n#### 3B\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy goes DOWN \u2192 (4,5)\n\nTheir head at (4,5), still we\u2019re at (5,8) with the same 3 clean options (UP/RIGHT/DOWN).  \nTheir replies next turn:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) (apple)\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) (empty)\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) (empty)\n\nAgain: no mutual head-on if we go DOWN/RIGHT/UP from (5,8) \u2014 all safe. We\u2019re towering over them with more space and more score.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare UP vs RIGHT\n\n- **UP (4,9):**\n  - Safe.\n  - No apple.\n  - Locks us to the top with **only 2 moves** going forward.\n  - Gives them free access to a whole cluster of apples underneath.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,8):**\n  - Safe vs all enemy moves.\n  - +1 apple, we go **8\u20136**.\n  - Next turn we have **3 safe options**, not 2.\n  - We sit directly over the main apple cluster and can turn **(5,7)** into a winning head-on trap.\n  - Perfect for boxing them between:\n    - Our long spine on the left, and  \n    - Our growing presence across the top-middle.\n\nWe\u2019re ahead on apples and we want **aggressive control**. RIGHT gives us food, space, and leverage to force **favorable** head-ons later. Why let them breathe, right? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan (note to future me \ud83e\udde0)\n\n- From (5,8), prioritize:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (5,7)** if we can safely convert that apple into a **double-KO threat** they can\u2019t afford.\n  - Or **RIGHT \u2192 (6,8)** / **UP \u2192 (5,9)** if enemy positions make (5,7) too messy.\n- Keep extending a horizontal **ceiling** across the top while our tail anchors the left side; aim to funnel them into a narrow central lane.\n- Any time a cell offers a likely **head-on where we still win on apples**, lean into it \u2014 we\u2019re the bully on this board now.\n- Don\u2019t dive straight down into their body cluster until:\n  - We\u2019ve stretched farther right, and  \n  - We can close a clean box around them with our length.\n\nRIGHT",

GROW TO LENGTH 8!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,6) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 Apple 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND WE EAT! GROW TO LENGTH 8!\n\nSWEET! TWO APPLE MOVES! DOWN to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,6)! BOTH GROW US! LET'S CHECK ENEMY MOVES TO SEE COLLISION RISKS!\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (5,8):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,9) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nENEMY HAS THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, RIGHT! NO INSTANT DEATH FOR THEM THIS TURN! THEY CAN'T HIT OUR BODY DIRECTLY FROM (5,8) UNLESS WE MOVE INTO THEM!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS:**\n- If we go DOWN to (5,5) and enemy goes DOWN to (5,7) \u2014 NO COLLISION (different cells).\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,6) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,8) \u2014 NO COLLISION.\n- What about if we go UP to (5,7) and enemy goes DOWN to (5,7)? THAT'S A HEAD-ON! BOTH DIE! Since we're shorter (7 vs 8), we LOSE if both die! AVOID UP!\n- If we go UP to (5,7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,8) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go UP to (5,7) and enemy goes UP to (5,9) \u2014 safe.\n\nSO UP IS RISKY BECAUSE ENEMY MIGHT GO DOWN! Since enemy has three safe moves, probability of DOWN is 1/3? But we can't risk it! UP is also not an apple move, so LESS VALUE! ELIMINATE UP!\n\n**NOW BETWEEN DOWN (5,5) AND RIGHT (6,6):**\nBOTH GROW US TO LENGTH 8! ENEMY IS LENGTH 8 AFTER THEIR MOVE (unless they eat an apple this turn \u2014 check apples near them: (5,8) is empty, (6,8) empty, (5,9) empty, (5,7) empty). NO APPLES ADJACENT TO ENEMY HEAD! So enemy stays length 8! AFTER WE EAT, WE TIE LENGTH AT 8! HUGE!\n\n**FUTURE POSITIONING:**\n- **DOWN to (5,5):** Puts us near apples at (5,4), (6,6), (7,6)? Also close to our long body trail on left. Next moves from (5,5): UP back to (5,6) (will be empty after we move), DOWN to (5,4) (apple!), LEFT to (4,5) (empty?), RIGHT to (6,5) (empty). Good options!\n- **RIGHT to (6,6):** Puts us near apples at (7,6), (5,5), (6,0 far). Next moves from (6,6): UP to (6,7) (empty), DOWN to (6,5) (empty), LEFT to (5,6) (empty), RIGHT to (7,6) (apple!). Also good!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They might go DOWN to (5,7) to stay close to us, or RIGHT to (6,8) to move toward center, or UP to (5,9) toward top edge. If they go DOWN to (5,7), they'll be directly above our old head position (5,6) which will be empty. That could set up a future head-on if we go back up? But we'll be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** We want to pressure enemy and maybe force them into a corner! With equal length after this turn, we can consider head-on collisions as a WIN for us if we plan it right! But not yet \u2014 need to get positional advantage first. Let's go for DOWN to (5,5) because it keeps us more central and sets up to possibly cut off enemy's escape downward later. Also, eating (5,5) removes an apple enemy might want. RIGHT to (6,6) is also good, but puts us on the right edge a bit. HMM...\n\nCHAT, BOTH ARE SOLID! BUT LET'S THINK: Enemy at (5,8) might go RIGHT to (6,8). If we go RIGHT to (6,6), we're two steps down and same x as them \u2014 could lead to a vertical alignment. If we go DOWN to (5,5), we're directly below them by three cells \u2014 they might try to chase us down? Either way, WE GROW AND TIE LENGTH! LET'S PICK DOWN TO (5,5) AND DOMINATE THE CENTER! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** After eating (5,5), we're length 8, head at (5,5). Enemy likely at (5,7), (6,8), or (5,9). Target next apple at (5,4) or (6,6). Keep building length and look for opportunity to trap enemy against our body or wall. Avoid getting pinned ourselves. With equal length, we can now force favorable head-ons if positioned correctly!\n\nDOWN",

So:\n- Most rational responses to our **DOWN** are **RIGHT (6,6)** or **DOWN (5,5)**.\n- In both of those, our move to **(5,7)** is 100% safe and we get +1 apple.\n\nLet\u2019s look at those branches.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Branch A: We DOWN \u2192 (5,7), they RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)\n\nAfter the move:\n- **Us:** head (5,7), length 10 (we grew).\n- **Them:** head (6,6), length 8 (they grew).\n\nBoard structure:\n- We\u2019re directly **above and left** of them, with a huge horizontal spine at y=8.\n- On the next turn:\n  - Our only legal safe move will be **RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)** (UP is backward, LEFT/DOWN are into their body).  \n  - From (6,6), they can go:  \n    - UP \u2192 (6,7)  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (6,5)\n\nIf next turn:\n- We go RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)\n- They go UP \u2192 (6,7)\n\nThat\u2019s a **head-on at (6,7)** with **no apple there**:\n- We\u2019d have **9** apples.\n- They\u2019d have **7** apples.  \nDouble KO \u2192 we win again.\n\nSo even when we\u2019re \u201cforced\u201d to (6,7) next turn, the only dangerous collision is **still winning for us**. If they\u2019re smart, they **won\u2019t** go UP; they\u2019ll sidestep and let us keep control.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Branch B: We DOWN \u2192 (5,7), they DOWN \u2192 (5,5)\n\nAfter the move:\n- **Us:** head (5,7), 9 apples.\n- **Them:** head (5,5), 7 apples.\n\nNext turn from (5,7):\n- UP \u2192 (5,8) backward (illegal)\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) (their body)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6) (their body)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) (empty)\n\nSo we\u2019re effectively forced **RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)**, but:\n\nFrom their head at (5,5):\n- Legal: LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5), DOWN (5,4).\n- They **cannot** reach (6,7) in one step.\n\nSo:\n- Our forced move to (6,7) is **completely safe** and likely sets us up near even more apples (like (7,6), (8,7) soon after).\n- We\u2019ll be at **10 apples** after that next-turn grab, and still ahead.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare DOWN vs UP vs RIGHT\n\n- **UP (5,9):**\n  - Safe but **no apple**.\n  - Only 2 future directions (left/right).\n  - Leaves juicy apples at (5,7), (6,6), (5,5), (7,6) mostly to the enemy.\n  - Passive, low pressure.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n  - Safe, keeps 3 future options.\n  - No apple this turn.\n  - Still good positioning, but we don\u2019t immediately leverage our score lead.\n\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n  - **Apple now** \u2192 we go from 8 \u2192 **9**.\n  - Either:\n    - Enemy griefs and takes a losing head-on \u2192 **instant win**, or\n    - Enemy plays safe \u2192 we live, stay on top of them, and keep building a ceiling to box them in.\n  - Sets up follow-up shapes where any head-on they can force is still **in our favor**.\n\nWe\u2019re ahead on score, and the rules literally say to **try to force a head-on when we\u2019re ahead**. DOWN creates a high-pressure kill zone while still being safe against any rational response.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- We\u2019re about to sit at **(5,7)** on top of their stack; after that, we likely slide **RIGHT** across row 7.\n- Goal: extend a long horizontal **ceiling** from the left wall across the mid-top while our old tail already hugs the left side.\n- Use that structure to **box them into the lower-left/center**, while we farm the mid-right apples ((7,6), (8,7), etc.).\n- Any time a move offers a possible head-on where we\u2019re still ahead on apples, keep threatening it \u2014 they\u2019ll have to dodge, and every dodge gives us more board control.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s check every direction:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Move check from our head (5,7)\n\n#### \u2b06 UP \u2192 (5,8)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck (body segment (5,8)).\n- Moving directly backwards = **instant self-KO** \ud83d\udc80\n- \u274c Illegal / suicidal.\n\n#### \u2b07 DOWN \u2192 (5,6)\n- That cell is **enemy body** (their segment at (5,6)), and it\u2019s **not their tail**.\n- On this turn, only their tail at (2,5) can ever vacate. (5,6) will stay part of their body after they move.\n- So if we go DOWN, we ram straight into their body and die.\n- \u274c Guaranteed death.\n\n#### \u2b05 LEFT \u2192 (4,7)\n- That\u2019s also **enemy body** (segment (4,7)), not their tail.\n- Same logic: that square is staying occupied.\n- \u274c Guaranteed death.\n\n#### \u27a1 RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)\n- On the board: (6,7) is **empty**.\n- Our own body is nowhere there.\n- Can their head also land there this turn?\n  - They\u2019re at (5,5). Their non-suicidal options are:\n    - DOWN \u2192 (5,4) (apple)\n    - LEFT \u2192 (4,5)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (6,5)\n  - None of those are (6,7). They can\u2019t teleport 2 squares vertically \ud83d\ude02\n- So RIGHT is **safe this turn**, no head-on, no body collision, no wall.\n\n\u27a1 **RIGHT is the only non-suicidal move.** No 50/50s, no galaxy brain needed: everything else kills us.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc8 Positioning after RIGHT\n\nIf we go RIGHT to **(6,7)**:\n- We don\u2019t eat an apple now, so we **don\u2019t grow**.\n- Our new shape:\n  - **Head:** (6,7)\n  - Body chain behind: (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)\n  - Tail moves up from (0,5) to (0,6).\n\nWe\u2019re still forming a **thick top-left wall**, now extending a bit to the right.  \nWe\u2019re also inching closer to that juicy apple at **(8,7)** and sitting above the cluster (6,6)/(7,6) that the opponent wants.\n\nEnemy most likely takes the apple at (5,4) or repositions, but either way:\n- We maintain the **apple lead**.\n- We keep pushing our \u201cceiling\u201d across the board, aiming to **box them into the lower-middle** in future turns.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n- Keep sliding **right along row 7/8** to build a long horizontal wall across the top.\n- Use our big left-side body as the **left wall** of the box; grow just enough to extend that wall, but don\u2019t over-commit into the top-right corner too early.\n- Watch enemy\u2019s escape routes around y=5\u20136. As we stretch right, look for chances to:\n  - Cut above or beside them and\n  - Threaten **head-on collisions we win** thanks to our apple lead.\n- Always check that any \u201caggressive dive\u201d near (6,6)/(7,6) doesn\u2019t trap our own head in a tiny pocket. We want **space dominance**, not a mutual coffin.\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf89)\nENEMY HEAD: (6,7) \u2014 LENGTH 9 (TIED IN LENGTH! WE CAUGHT UP! NOW WE CAN BE AGGRESSIVE!)\n\nBOARD CHECK: \nOur body: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] \u2014 HEAD at (5,4) now!\nEnemy body: [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)] \u2014 HEAD at (6,7)\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER? Enemy is at (6,7) \u2014 not adjacent to us! We're safe from instant collision this turn! BUT we must consider SIMULTANEOUS moves!\n\nOUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (5,4):\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,5) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE! CAN'T GO BACK INTO NECK!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,3) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,4) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nUP is INSTANT DEATH! So we have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT as safe options.\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (6,7):\n- UP \u2192 (6,8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 Apple 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND THEY EAT! (GROW TO LENGTH 10!)\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nENEMY CANNOT GO LEFT (their body). They can go UP, DOWN (to eat apple at (6,6)!), or RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS (SIMULTANEOUS):\n- If we go DOWN to (5,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 NO COLLISION, safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 safe.\n- **CRITICAL:** What if we go RIGHT to (6,4) and enemy goes UP to (6,8)? Safe.\n- **DANGER ZONE:** What if we go RIGHT to (6,4) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,7)? Safe.\n- **WHAT IF WE GO RIGHT TO (6,4) AND ENEMY GOES DOWN TO (6,6)?** Different y, safe.\n- **NO POSSIBLE HEAD-ON THIS TURN** \u2014 cells are far apart.\n\nBUT WAIT! If enemy goes DOWN to (6,6), they EAT THE APPLE and GROW to length 10! They'd be longer than us again! \ud83d\ude31 WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN! We need to either BLOCK that apple or force them away!\n\nCAN WE BLOCK (6,6)? From (5,4), we can't reach (6,6) in one move. But we can position to THREATEN them next turn!\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: We're tied length 9-9. If they eat that apple, they're 10, we're 9 \u2014 they can force head-ons and win! So we must either:\n1) Get an apple ourselves this turn to stay tied (but no apples adjacent to us! \ud83d\ude2d)\n2) Move to cut off their escape or set up a trap where we can force a head-on while we're equal length.\n\nLOOK AT THE BOARD! Enemy at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), next turn they'll be at (6,6) with length 10. We need to be adjacent to them NEXT TURN to threaten a head-on while we're still equal length (if we can eat an apple next turn). But if they eat now, we'd need to eat TWO apples to tie again! UGH!\n\nOPTIONS ANALYSIS:\n- **DOWN to (5,3):** Puts us near bottom edge, far from enemy. Next turn from (5,3): UP to (5,4) (empty), DOWN to (5,2) (empty), LEFT to (4,3) (empty), RIGHT to (6,3) (empty). Safe but passive. Lets enemy eat apple and grow.\n- **LEFT to (4,4):** Puts us closer to enemy's possible path? From (4,4) next turn: UP to (4,5) (empty), DOWN to (4,3) (empty), LEFT to (3,4) (empty), RIGHT to (5,4) (empty). Still not threatening.\n- **RIGHT to (6,4):** THIS IS INTERESTING! From (6,4) we are DIRECTLY BELOW the apple at (6,6) (which enemy wants). Next turn from (6,4): UP to (6,5) (empty), DOWN to (6,3) (empty), LEFT to (5,4) (empty), RIGHT to (7,4) (empty). If enemy goes DOWN to (6,6) this turn, next turn they could go DOWN to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,6) etc. If we are at (6,4) and they go to (6,5), we could go UP to (6,5) simultaneously for a HEAD-ON! But we'd both die... and they have more apples (10 vs our 9) so we'd LOSE! \ud83d\ude2c So maybe not.\n\nBUT WAIT! If they eat the apple this turn, they'll be longer, so head-on is bad for us. We need to AVOID letting them eat that apple! Can we scare them away from it?\n\nENEMY'S PERSPECTIVE: They see apple at (6,6). They likely want it! But they also see our head at (5,4). If we move RIGHT to (6,4), we're moving TOWARD them but not directly threatening. They might still go for the apple.\n\nWHAT IF WE MOVE TO CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE AFTER THEY EAT? Hmm...\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to be AGGRESSIVE! We're equal length! We should try to BOX THEM IN near the top-right! Look at their body: they have a long tail along the top. Our body is in the middle-left. We could try to push them into a wall or their own body!\n\nRIGHT NOW, maybe we go RIGHT to (6,4) to position ourselves to move UP to (6,5) next turn, potentially blocking their path downward if they go to (6,6). But they could just go RIGHT to (7,7) this turn instead of going for the apple.\n\nCHAT, I'M THINKING: Let's go RIGHT to (6,4)! It keeps us close, gives us options, and maybe we can force a situation where we eat an apple next turn to stay tied if they eat theirs. Also, from (6,4) we have access to apples at (6,6) (if we can get there before them) and (7,6) later.\n\nBUT WE MUST BE CAREFUL OF HEAD-ON NEXT TURN! We'll have to evaluate then.\n\nALTERNATIVE: LEFT to (4,4) might set up a flanking maneuver? Eh.\n\nI THINK RIGHT IS THE MOVE! STAY AGGRESSIVE! DON'T LET THEM BREATHE! WE'RE TIED LENGTH! TIME TO APPLY PRESSURE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURN: From (6,4), assess enemy's new head position. If they ate the apple, we need to eat one ASAP. If they didn't, we can try to cut them off. Avoid head-on unless we have length advantage!\n\nRIGHT",

We want to stay alive, grab more apples, and start really **locking this guy under us**.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (6,7)\n\n#### \u2b05 LEFT \u2192 (5,7)\n- That\u2019s our own body segment (our neck).\n- Moving directly into the segment behind our head = instant self-KO.\n- \u274c LEFT is illegal / death.\n\n#### \u2b06 UP \u2192 (6,8)\n- (6,8) is currently empty.\n- Opponent at (5,4) can only go to (5,3), (4,4), or (6,4). No way they reach (6,8) this turn.\n- So UP is **safe this turn**.\n- But we leave the apple at **(6,6)** on the board \u2013 and we\u2019re giving them potential future access via a path like (5,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (6,6).\n- Also pushes us closer to the top wall with fewer turn-20 options (only UP/RIGHT, with our own body blocking LEFT and DOWN soon).\n\n#### \u27a1 RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)\n- (7,7) is empty.\n- Again, opponent can\u2019t reach that square in one move.\n- So RIGHT is **safe** and keeps us in the top lane to chain apples at **(7,6)** and **(8,7)** next.\n- But\u2026 we still leave the **(6,6)** apple untouched and let them possibly route to it later.\n\n#### \u2b07 DOWN \u2192 (6,6)\n- (6,6) is an apple \ud83c\udf4e.\n- No snake body is on (6,6) right now.\n- Opponent cannot reach (6,6) this turn from (5,4).\n- So DOWN is **safe** and gives us **+1 apple immediately**, putting us up **10\u20138**.\n\nBody after DOWN (we grow, so tail does NOT move):\n- New head: **(6,6)**\n- Then: (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6) (tail)\n- We create a thicker vertical barrier above them, right where they\u2019d love to escape.\n\nNow check next-turn options from (6,6):\n- UP \u2192 (6,7): backwards into our neck \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6): **always enemy body** next turn no matter where they go (we checked all 3 of their moves), so that\u2019s suicide.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6): apple, and opponent cannot reach or contest it next turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5): empty now and cannot be occupied by them this turn.\n\nSo after going DOWN we still have **two guaranteed safe follow-ups** (RIGHT for another apple, or DOWN into open space), and we\u2019ve denied them a crucial central apple.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move is best?\n\nAll safe: **UP, RIGHT, DOWN**  \nBut:\n\n- **UP**: Safe but passive, wastes a free apple at (6,6) and lets them possibly sneak it later.\n- **RIGHT**: Safe, sets us up for apples, but again delays the free, uncontested apple under our nose.\n- **DOWN**: Safest *and* strongest:\n  - Secures **immediate apple** \u2192 score **10\u20138**.\n  - Thickens our wall directly above their cluster.\n  - Sets up an easy follow-up to **(7,6)** for yet another apple and even more board control.\n  - Moves us closer to them for future **head-on threats we WIN** thanks to the apple lead.\n\nWe are ahead. We want **more length, more apples, and more pressure**. DOWN does all three.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n- Next couple turns, strongly prefer:\n  - From (6,6) \u2192 **RIGHT to (7,6)** (apple) if safe, then start curling **up/right** to form a big ceiling over the enemy.\n  - Or **DOWN to (6,5)** if we need space and want to threaten them from the side.\n- Keep extending a **horizontal wall** across the middle/top while our tail locks the left side.\n- Look for chances to:\n  - Force them into narrow tunnels under our body, and\n  - Threaten **head-on collisions** once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples.\n- Always leave ourselves at least 2 safe exits each turn; don\u2019t over-commit to the top wall and self-box.\n\nDOWN",

HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udca5 BOTH DIE! They have 10 apples, we have 8 \u2192 WE LOSE! \u274c AVOID!\n- If we go DOWN to (6,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go UP to (6,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (6,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,4) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go UP to (6,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (6,3) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,4) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 safe.\n\nCRITICAL: GOING UP TO (6,5) IS POTENTIALLY FATAL IF ENEMY GOES DOWN! That's a direct head-on risk! Since they're longer, we CANNOT afford that collision! We must avoid UP this turn!\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: They are longer (10 vs 8). We need to eat apples QUICK to catch up! But also avoid being trapped. Look at apples nearby: (6,0) far, (7,6) enemy might eat, (5,6) enemy might eat. We need to find a safe path to an apple while staying away from their head.\n\nOPTIONS:\n- **DOWN to (6,3):** Puts us farther from enemy, safe from head-on. Next turn from (6,3): UP to (6,4) (empty), DOWN to (6,2) (empty), LEFT to (5,3) (empty), RIGHT to (7,3) (empty). Safe but passive. Lets enemy eat an apple and grow even more. \ud83d\ude13\n- **RIGHT to (7,4):** Puts us to the right. Next turn from (7,4): UP to (7,5) (empty), DOWN to (7,3) (empty), LEFT to (6,4) (empty), RIGHT to (8,4) (empty). Also safe, but not directly toward apples. Could flank?\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We're at a length disadvantage! We MUST eat apples ASAP! The closest reachable apple? From (6,4), apple at (7,6) is two away but enemy might grab it. Apple at (5,6) is two away but enemy might grab it. Apple at (6,0) is far. Apple at (7,2) is closer? From (6,3) we could go to (6,2) then (7,2)? Hmm.\n\nActually, apple at (7,2) is at y=2. From (6,3), DOWN to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2) eats it in two turns if safe. That's a plan! But we need to survive this turn first.\n\nENEMY LIKELY MOVES: They will probably go for an apple! Either LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6). They might avoid DOWN to (6,5) because they see our head at (6,4) and might fear us going UP? But they're longer, so head-on is bad for us, not them. They might be aggressive and go DOWN to pressure us? Risky for them if we go UP? But we won't.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE GO DOWN TO (6,3)! It avoids head-on, keeps us safe, and sets up a path to apple at (7,2) or (6,0) eventually. We cannot afford to die now! We need to survive and catch up in apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT is also safe but doesn't progress toward apples as directly. DOWN gives us more options next turn.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURN: From (6,3), move toward (7,2) apple if safe, or (6,0). Avoid enemy head! We need 2 apples to tie length, 3 to lead! GRIND TIME! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Time to extend the lead and tighten the noose.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves from (6,6)\n\n#### UP \u2192 (6,7)\n- That\u2019s our own neck segment.\n- Moving directly backwards into our body = instant death.\n- Illegal / suicide. Throw it out.\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (5,6)\n- Currently enemy body, and it\u2019s **not** their tail.\n- After they move, (5,6) will still be occupied by some segment (their internal body shifts, tail is at (2,6)).\n- Moving there is guaranteed collision with enemy body.\n- Immediate death. Toss it.\n\nSo only contenders: **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) DOWN \u2192 (6,5)\n\nCurrent board at (6,5): empty.\n\nEnemy from (6,4) can move:\n- UP \u2192 (6,5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3)\n(LEFT is backwards into their own neck (5,4), so illegal.)\n\nIf we go DOWN:\n\n- **If they go UP \u2192 (6,5)**:\n  - Both heads go to (6,5) at the same time.\n  - Double head-on collision, both snakes die.\n  - Apples: we stay at 10, they at 8. We win by tiebreaker.\n  - So that outcome is actually winning for us.\n\n- **If they go RIGHT \u2192 (7,4)**:\n  - Our new head: (6,5). Their new head: (7,4). No collision.\n  - Our new body: [6,5, 6,6, 6,7, 5,7, 5,8, 4,8, 3,8, 2,8, 1,8, 1,7, 0,7]  \n    (tail (0,6) disappears)\n  - Next turn from (6,5):\n    - UP \u2192 (6,6): our own body (neck) \u2013 illegal.\n    - LEFT \u2192 (5,5): enemy body \u2013 death.\n    - DOWN \u2192 (6,4): enemy body \u2013 death.\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (7,5): only safe square.\n  - So with this enemy move, we\u2019d have **exactly one legal move**, and it\u2019s a contested line directly above their head. Very narrow, very forcing.\n\n- **If they go DOWN \u2192 (6,3)**:\n  - Our neighbors next turn from (6,5):\n    - UP \u2192 6,6 (our body) \u2013 no.\n    - LEFT \u2192 5,5 (enemy body) \u2013 no.\n    - DOWN \u2192 6,4 (enemy body) \u2013 no.\n    - RIGHT \u2192 7,5 \u2013 the only escape.\n  - Again, only one legal move.\n\nSo yes, DOWN gives a chance at an immediate winning head-on if they go UP, but if they choose either sideways/down, we end in a corridor with a single exit. That\u2019s exactly the kind of low-mobility situation that gets you boxed and slowly killed if anything changes against you.\n\nGiven the rules say:\n- Prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-ups\n- And we\u2019re already ahead and not desperate\n\nDOWN is a bit too tight, even though the head-on outcome is favorable.\n\n---\n\n### 3) RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)\n\nSquare (7,6) currently:\n- Has an apple.\n- Not occupied by any body.\n- Enemy cannot reach it this turn (their neighbors are (6,5),(7,4),(6,3)).\n\nSo RIGHT:\n- Is safe this turn.\n- Gives us +1 apple immediately \u2192 score 11\u20138.\n- We grow; tail (0,6) stays.\n\nNew body if we go RIGHT:\n- Head: (7,6)\n- Then: (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7), (0,6)\n\nNow check next-turn safety from (7,6) under all enemy responses:\n\nEnemy from (6,4):\n\n1) They go UP \u2192 (6,5)\n   - Their new body doesn\u2019t touch (7,7), (8,6), or (7,5).\n   - Our options from (7,6):\n     - UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2013 empty\n     - RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2013 empty\n     - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2013 empty\n   - We have 3 safe moves.\n\n2) They go RIGHT \u2192 (7,4)\n   - Again, none of (7,7),(8,6),(7,5) are in their new body.\n   - We still have 3 safe moves.\n\n3) They go DOWN \u2192 (6,3)\n   - Same story: no occupation of our adjacent squares.\n   - Still 3 safe moves.\n\nSo RIGHT:\n- Keeps us very flexible (three good exits).\n- Increases our apple lead to 11\u20138.\n- Extends our horizontal presence over the center-right, strengthening the \u201cceiling\u201d we\u2019re building above them.\n- Still leaves us room to later threaten a head-on from a position of even more strength.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Strategic note to future me\n\nWe\u2019re about to move to (7,6) and go up 11\u20138.\n\nNext few turns:\n- Use the flexibility from (7,6):\n  - If enemy drifts right, we can push DOWN then LEFT to chase and threaten head-ons from above.\n  - If they stay more central/left, we can go UP toward (7,7) and then across toward (8,7) to extend a long horizontal wall, boxing them under our massive body.\n- Keep at least two safe exits every turn; no squeezing ourselves into one-move corridors unless we\u2019re taking an immediate winning head-on.\n- Look for chances where an apple square is a natural head-on trap: with our now bigger lead, we\u2019ll be very happy to trade.\n\nFinal call: grab the free apple, keep three exits, keep the pressure.\n\nRIGHT",

That's two apart, no collision.\n- Actually, NO DIRECT HEAD-ON RISK this turn because enemy can't move into our possible squares directly. PHEW! \ud83d\ude05\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: They are longer (11 vs 9). We need apples BADLY! Look at apples nearby: (7,2) is close! From (6,3), DOWN to (6,2) then RIGHT to (7,2) eats it next turn! That's our plan! Also apple at (6,0) is farther but reachable. Apple at (5,1) and (5,0) are left/down.\n\nENEMY LIKELY MOVES: They might go for apple at (8,7) (UP then RIGHT?) or (9,2) (DOWN far). They might also try to cut us off? But they're long, maybe they'll be greedy.\n\nOUR OPTIONS:\n- **DOWN to (6,2):** Sets up for apple at (7,2) next turn! Also keeps distance from enemy. Next turn from (6,2): UP to (6,3) (empty), DOWN to (6,1) (empty), LEFT to (5,2) (empty), RIGHT to (7,2) (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). That's strong!\n- **LEFT to (5,3):** Moves toward apples at (5,1)/(5,0). Next turn from (5,3): UP to (5,4) (our body? Wait, our body at (5,4) is still there? Yes, it's our second segment! So UP from (5,3) would hit our own body next turn! That's dangerous! So LEFT limits future options. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,3):** Moves right, away from apples? Apple at (7,2) is below, so from (7,3) we could go DOWN to (7,2) next turn too! But then we're closer to enemy head at (7,6)? Actually 3 cells away vertically. Might be riskier.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to grab that (7,2) apple ASAP to get to length 10! Then maybe go for (6,0) or (5,0) to tie length! Avoid getting trapped by enemy's long body. They have a wall of body on left side, but we can maneuver below.\n\nCHAT, I THINK **DOWN** IS THE MOVE! It sets up the apple grab perfectly, avoids enemy, and keeps future options open! LEFT is risky because it boxes us next turn (can't go up). RIGHT is okay but not as direct for the apple.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, turn 21, let\u2019s cook.\n\nWe\u2019re at head (7,6), enemy head (6,3). We\u2019re up 11\u20138, our snake is longer, we\u2019ve got the high ground and a massive ceiling over them. Goal: keep them compressed under us, grow, and eventually force them into a bad trade or box.\n\nFirst, check all four moves:\n\n### 1) LEFT \u2192 (6,6)\n- That\u2019s our own neck segment.\n- Moving directly backwards = instant death.\n- OUT.\n\n### 2) UP \u2192 (7,7)\n- Target cell (7,7) is empty.\n- Enemy from (6,3) can go to (6,2), (5,3), or (7,3); none reach (7,7).\n- No body will slide into (7,7) this turn.\n- Safe now.\n- But next turn from (7,7), our only legal moves are:\n  - UP \u2192 (7,8)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)\n  (DOWN is neck, LEFT is our body.)\n- So only 2 follow-up options. Both decent, but we\u2019re slightly restricting ourselves.\n\n### 3) DOWN \u2192 (7,5)\n- (7,5) is empty.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (7,5) this turn from (6,3).\n- No snake body will occupy (7,5) after movement.\n- Safe this turn.\n- Next turn from (7,5), neighbors:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,5) empty\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,4) empty\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) empty\n  (UP is neck.)\n- So we keep 3 follow-up options, and we move closer to the enemy \u2014 more aggression, more interaction.\n\nBut: going DOWN also drags us into the more cluttered mid-board where both bodies interlock. That\u2019s where random squeezes and awkward corridors appear. Good for aggression, but a bit riskier in terms of long-term space control. We\u2019re already winning; we don\u2019t need to share tight space yet.\n\n### 4) RIGHT \u2192 (8,6)\n- (8,6) is empty.\n- Enemy from (6,3) can\u2019t reach (8,6) in one move.\n- No body is sliding into (8,6) this turn; our tail at (0,6) will vacate, enemy tail moves, but nothing touches (8,6).\n- Safe.\n\nNew body after RIGHT:\n- Head: (8,6)\n- Body: [(7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (0,7)]\n\nNext turn from (8,6) we\u2019ll have:\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) (apple)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) (edge lane)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) (open space)\n(LEFT is our neck.)\n\nSo we keep 3 clean, safe exits in a big open area on the top-right of the board. At the same time, our long body from the left side at y=7\u20138 continues to form a \u201croof\u201d above the enemy, keeping them boxed under us. RIGHT extends that roof horizontally while preserving excellent mobility.\n\nComparing DOWN vs RIGHT:\n- Both give 3 follow-up options.\n- DOWN moves us into the same congested mid-lane as the enemy; we share space earlier and risk weird mutual traps.\n- RIGHT claims more uncontested territory, keeps us flexible, and sets up a very natural follow-up to grab the (8,7) apple while still towering over them.\n\nWe\u2019re already ahead in apples and length. We don\u2019t need to gamble in shared tight space yet; better to own the big region, then come down on them from above and the right, and look for a **forced** head-on later when they\u2019re desperate.\n\n---\n\n### Short plan for future me\n- From (8,6), prioritize:\n  - Taking (8,7) soon for the apple and an even stronger horizontal roof.\n  - Maintaining at least 2\u20133 safe moves each turn, especially when near the right wall.\n- Use our top-right dominance to:\n  - Extend a long horizontal wall around y=7\u20138.\n  - Then pivot DOWN on the right side (via (8,5)/(9,5)) to start wrapping under them.\n- Watch for chances where their head is in a tunnel under our body: if we can create an unavoidable head-on there, we take it \u2014 we still win the trade with our apple lead.\n\nFinal move this turn:\n\nRIGHT",

Tail (0,7) disappears.\n- From (9,6) next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,7) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,5) (empty)\n  - RIGHT is off-board, LEFT is our neck.\n- Only **2 future options**, and we\u2019re pinned on the right wall.\n- Also we don\u2019t grow, so we give up free value and some dominance just to hug the edge. Not worth it.\n\n---\n\n### 4) DOWN \u2192 (8,5)\n- (8,5) is empty.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (8,5) this turn; no body shifts into it.\n- Safe this turn.\n- New body: head (8,5), then (8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7); tail (0,7) disappears.\n- From (8,5) next turn:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,5) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,4) (empty)\n- So also **3 options** next turn.\n- Strategically this drags us down into the mid-board where their body lives. That\u2019s more chaotic, more chance of mutual squeezes in tight corridors. We *want* to kill them eventually, but we\u2019re already ahead; we don\u2019t need to jump down into the scrum yet when we can keep dominating from above and growing.\n\n---\n\n### Comparing UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT\n\n- **RIGHT**: safe but gives only 2 follow-ups and no apple. It also glues us to the wall. Pure downgrade vs the other two.\n- **DOWN**: 3 follow-ups, keeps us flexible, but walks us into the same congested band the enemy occupies. That increases immediate interaction but also increases the risk of weird, low-visibility traps.\n- **UP**: 3 follow-ups, **plus** an apple and an even bigger body advantage. It strengthens our roof over them, keeps us in wide open space, and sets up a long-term box from the top-right. With a bigger lead, any future forced head-on is even more winning for us.\n\nGiven:\n- We\u2019re already ahead in apples and length.\n- We want to box them in, not give them easy counterplay.\n- Free apple + safe position + strong future mobility is available.\n\nUP is the best move.\n\n---\n\n### Short plan for future me\n- From (8,7), prioritize staying in the **top-right high ground**: consider expanding to (8,8)/(9,7)/(9,8) to fortify the ceiling.\n- Keep our horizontal wall across y=7\u20138 strong, but leave ourselves at least one clear downward escape lane we control (likely around x7\u20138) so we can descend later to finish the box.\n- Track their head: when their available space gets tight under our body, look for lines where any escape route leads into either:\n  - our body (they die), or\n  - a forced head-on where they cannot dodge (we\u2019re longer and ahead on apples, so a double KO wins us the game).\n\nUP",

They can go UP, LEFT (to apple), RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS (SIMULTANEOUS):\n- If we go UP to (7,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (7,7) \u2014 safe, different cells.\n- If we go RIGHT to (8,2) and enemy goes DOWN? They can't go down. Phew.\n- WAIT \u2014 what if we go RIGHT to (8,2) and enemy goes LEFT to (7,7)? No collision.\n- What if we go UP to (7,3) and enemy goes RIGHT to (9,7)? Safe.\n- Actually, NO DIRECT SAME-CELL COLLISION POSSIBLE this turn! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: Enemy is likely to go LEFT to (7,7) to eat that apple and grow to length 13! That would widen the gap! We need to grow FAST too! Where are apples? Look at board: (6,0), (5,1), (5,0), (1,0), (1,5), (1,6), (0,9), (2,9), (8,9), (3,5), (9,2), (0,4), (7,7), (3,2) \u2014 but (7,7) is the one enemy is eyeing.\n\nOUR OPTIONS:\n- **UP to (7,3):** Moves toward center, opens paths to top apples later. Safe, but no immediate apple.\n- **DOWN to (7,1):** Moves toward apple at (6,0) or (5,1) next turn. Could eat soon.\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):** Moves toward apple at (9,2) in two steps? Actually (9,2) is east. Also puts us closer to enemy? Enemy at (8,7) going left to (7,7) \u2014 we'd be at (8,2), that's 5 cells away vertically. Safe.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to BOX THE ENEMY! They have a long body along top-left. If they eat apple at (7,7), their head moves there, body extends behind. We should maybe swing DOWN to collect multiple apples in bottom-left (6,0), (5,0), (1,0) to catch up in length, then try to trap them against their own body/wall. But we must avoid being trapped ourselves!\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE GO **DOWN** to (7,1)! Why? It keeps us safe, moves toward a cluster of apples, and avoids moving closer to enemy prematurely. If we go RIGHT to (8,2), we're closer to enemy head after their move (they might be at (7,7)), but that's not necessarily bad. However, going DOWN gives us more growth potential next turn! Let's secure those apples and close the length gap! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

They didn't eat the apple at (7,7)? Interesting!)\n\nBOARD CHECK:\nOur body: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)] \u2014 HEAD at (7, 1)\nEnemy body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)] \u2014 HEAD at (8, 8)\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER? Enemy at (8,8) \u2014 7 cells away diagonally up-right. Not adjacent. But they can move fast!\n\nOUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (7,1):\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 2) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE! CAN'T GO BACK INTO NECK!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 0) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 1) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 1) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nUP IS INSTANT DEATH! So we have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (8,8):\n- UP \u2192 (8, 9) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u2705 SAFE (and GROWTH!)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 7) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\nENEMY CANNOT GO DOWN. They can go UP (to apple), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS (SIMULTANEOUS):\n- If we go DOWN to (7,0) and enemy goes LEFT to (7,8) \u2014 safe, far apart.\n- If we go LEFT to (6,1) and enemy goes UP to (8,9) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go RIGHT to (8,1) and enemy goes RIGHT to (9,8) \u2014 safe.\n- NO DIRECT SAME-CELL COLLISION POSSIBLE this turn! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: Enemy is likely to go UP to (8,9) to eat that apple and grow to length 13! That would widen the gap to 3! We NEED to eat an apple ASAP to close the gap! Where are apples? Look at board: (6,0), (5,1), (5,0), (1,0), (1,5), (1,6), (0,9), (2,9), (8,9), (3,5), (9,2), (0,4), (7,7), (3,2)\n\nCLOSEST APPLES TO US:\n- (6,0) \u2014 1 step DOWN from (7,1)? Actually DOWN is (7,0), then LEFT to (6,0) next turn.\n- (5,1) \u2014 1 step LEFT from (7,1)? Actually LEFT is (6,1), then LEFT again to (5,1) next turn.\n- (5,0) \u2014 2 steps: DOWN then LEFT, or LEFT then DOWN.\n- (1,0) cluster is far.\n\nOUR OPTIONS:\n- **DOWN to (7,0):** Puts us one step from apple at (6,0) and (5,0). Next turn we could go LEFT to (6,0) and eat! But then we're at bottom edge, limited upward movement.\n- **LEFT to (6,1):** Puts us one step from apple at (5,1). Next turn LEFT to (5,1) and eat! Also opens path to more apples in bottom-left.\n- **RIGHT to (8,1):** Moves toward apple at (9,2) in two steps? Actually (9,2) is east and up. But also moves us closer to enemy's territory? Enemy might be at (8,9) after eating. That's 8 cells away vertically. Not immediate threat.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to BOX THE ENEMY! They have a long body along top-left. If they eat apple at (8,9), their head moves there, body extends behind. We should SWARM the bottom-left apples to catch up in length! Once we're equal or longer, we can force head-on collisions or trap them against their own body/wall.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE GO **LEFT** to (6,1)! Why? It sets up a DIRECT path to apple at (5,1) next turn, and also keeps us closer to the cluster (6,0), (5,0) for subsequent eating. Going DOWN to (7,0) also works, but LEFT gives us more flexibility next turn (we could go DOWN to (6,0) OR LEFT to (5,1)). RIGHT moves us away from the apple cluster. LET'S SECURE THAT GROWTH AND CLOSE THE GAP! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

It keeps us alive one more turn but forces death the turn after.\n\nStill, from (7,8) we have **2 genuinely safe continuations**:\n- UP to (7,9)\n- LEFT to (6,8) then UP\n\nPositionally:\n- LEFT now gives us a huge almost-continuous roof along y=8 (x=1\u20135 plus 7,8) over the enemy, very nice for boxing.\n- We stay one row below the top, more central, not hugging the ceiling yet.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n- Inside board, empty.\n- Enemy nowhere close.\n- Safe this turn.\n\nAfter RIGHT (tail (1,7) moves):\n- New body: (9,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(2,8),(1,8)\n\nNext-turn neighbors from (9,8):\n- UP \u2192 (9,9) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,7) empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 neck \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n\nSo 2 safe options, but we\u2019re glued to the right wall with less central influence.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the good moves\n\n- **UP (to 8,9)**  \n  - +1 apple immediately \u2192 **13\u20139** lead.  \n  - 2 safe follow-ups (left/right).  \n  - Hugs the top edge; good, but reduces vertical flexibility a bit.\n\n- **LEFT (to 7,8)**  \n  - No apple this turn, still **12\u20139**.  \n  - Immediately 3 legal moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT), though we must **never** pick DOWN from there (future self-KO).  \n  - Positionally excellent: more central, strengthens an almost-solid horizontal roof over the enemy at y=8, and doesn\u2019t stick us on the very top wall yet.\n\n- **RIGHT (to 9,8)**  \n  - Safe, 2 follow-ups, but shoves us into the corner and sacrifices central control.  \n  - No real upside compared to UP or LEFT.\n\nGiven:\n- We already have a **3-point lead**.\n- No immediate head-on is available this turn.\n- User rules: prefer moves with **multiple safe follow-ups** and **good long-term board control**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **LEFT** is the nastiest strategic choice:\n- Keeps us flexible in the high center.\n- Extends a scary roof above the enemy\u2019s entire formation.\n- Sets us up to later grab apples on the top row (0,9 / 2,9 / 8,9) while continuing to box them in.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Short plan for future me\n\n- After moving to **(7,8)**:\n  - **Do NOT go DOWN to (7,7)** \u2014 that apple is a baited trap that leads to a forced self-death next cycle. Leave it or approach it from a different geometry later.\n  - Prioritize **UP to (7,9)** to start working the top lane over the enemy, then branch left/right along row 9 to scoop apples and extend the ceiling.\n  - Use our growing \u201croof\u201d on y=8\u20139 to eventually drop a vertical column (probably around x=5\u20137) to carve their space into a small box.\n  - If they ever look forced into a narrow tunnel under us and we can line up a head-on they can\u2019t dodge, we take it \u2014 we win any double KO as long as we keep the apple lead.\n\nLEFT",

They can go UP, DOWN (to apple), LEFT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS (SIMULTANEOUS):\n- If we go DOWN to (6,0) and enemy goes DOWN to (7,7) \u2014 safe, far apart.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,1) and enemy goes LEFT to (6,8) \u2014 safe.\n- NO DIRECT SAME-CELL COLLISION POSSIBLE this turn! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: WE HAVE TWO APPLES WITHIN ONE STEP! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e This is HUGE! We can close the gap by 1 apple this turn! Enemy might also eat the apple at (7,7) if they go DOWN, keeping the gap at 2. But we NEED to grow!\n\nWhich apple is better?\n- **DOWN to (6,0):** Puts us at bottom edge. Next turn, our head at (6,0). Possible moves: UP (back to (6,1) \u2014 our old neck? That cell will be empty next turn because we moved away), LEFT to (5,0) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT to (7,0) \u2014 empty. So we could eat another apple next turn!\n- **LEFT to (5,1):** Puts us at (5,1). Next turn, possible moves: UP to (5,2) \u2014 empty, DOWN to (5,0) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e, LEFT to (4,1) \u2014 empty. Also sets up for another apple!\n\nBoth are great! But consider the enemy's position. If enemy goes DOWN to (7,7) and eats, they grow to 13. Their body extends, blocking more of the top-right. We need to DOMINATE the bottom-left and then push upward.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating this apple, we'll be length 11. We should IMMEDIATELY target the next closest apple to grow to 12, then 13, CATCHING UP! Then we can be aggressive and force head-on collisions when we have equal or greater length! The cluster at (5,0), (6,0), (1,0) is our farming zone. Let's secure it!\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE GO **DOWN** to (6,0)! Why? It puts us on the bottom edge, which is a natural barrier. Next turn we can go LEFT to (5,0) for another apple, and then we're at length 12! Going LEFT to (5,1) is also good, but DOWN feels more aggressive in claiming the bottom row.

Throw it out.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**  \n- There\u2019s an apple there, no body right now.\n- This turn it\u2019s *technically* safe, we\u2019d eat and grow.\n- But look at the shape afterwards:\n\nNew body if we go DOWN:\n- Head: (7,7)\n- Then: (7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(2,8),(1,8)\n\nNeighbors of new head (7,7):\n- UP: (7,8) = neck\n- DOWN: (7,6) = our body\n- LEFT: (6,7) = our body\n- RIGHT: (8,7) = our body\n\nWe would be completely surrounded next turn with **zero legal moves**. That\u2019s a guaranteed self-death in one more move. With a winning position and a ton of space elsewhere, we do not take that trap. So DOWN is strategically losing even if not instant death.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**  \n- Cell is empty and on the board \u2192 safe this turn.\n- New body after LEFT (no apple, tail moves from (1,8)):\n  - Head: (6,8)\n  - Body: (7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(2,8)\n\nFrom (6,8) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) empty \u2192 legal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) our body \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) our body \u2192 illegal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) neck \u2192 illegal.\n\nSo LEFT now forces exactly **one** move next turn (UP). That\u2019s a corridor. It\u2019s safe, but it severely restricts our flexibility for one turn.\n\n**UP \u2192 (7,9)**  \n- Cell is empty, no apple, on the board \u2192 safe this turn.\n- New body after UP (tail moves from (1,8) to vanish):\n  - Head: (7,9)\n  - Body: (7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(2,8)\n\nFrom (7,9) next turn:\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) empty \u2192 legal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) has an apple \u2192 legal and tasty.\n- DOWN \u2192 neck (7,8) \u2192 illegal.\n- UP \u2192 off-board \u2192 illegal.\n\nSo with UP we keep **two** healthy options next turn, including a line toward an apple at (8,9). That\u2019s exactly what we want: multiple safe continuations.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Enemy considerations\n\nEnemy head: (6,1). They can move to:\n- (6,2), (5,1), (7,1), (6,0)\n\nNone of those touch or threaten:\n- Our current head (7,8), or\n- Our potential new heads (7,9) or (6,8)\n\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk whichever way we go. With a 3-point lead, we\u2019re not desperate; we want to keep the advantage and only look for head-on plays when we can force or heavily favor them.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic comparison\n\n- **DOWN**: short-term apple, but forces a death in the very next cycle. Completely off the table.\n- **LEFT**: safe, extends our horizontal \u201croof\u201d, but gives us only one legal move next turn (UP). Tight corridor, reduced tactical freedom.\n- **UP**: safe, keeps a strong roof on y=8, gives us two good options next turn, and points us toward the high-row apples to widen our lead.\n\nGiven our goals (stay alive, maintain multiple safe follow-ups, keep top control, grow steadily), **UP** is the cleanest, least-committal, and strongest play.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future me\n\n- From (7,9), favor:\n  - RIGHT to (8,9) if the follow-up after eating that apple doesn\u2019t trap us (watch that corner sequence: 8,9 \u2192 9,9 \u2192 9,8).\n  - Or LEFT to (6,9) if we want more central control without being forced deep into the right corner.\n- Keep building a high \u201cceiling\u201d over the enemy and look for chances to drop a vertical wall to box them in the lower-middle.\n- We have the score lead; only look for head-on collisions later if we can either guarantee they can\u2019t dodge, or if the board is so cramped that a double KO secures us the win by apples.\n\nUP",

Wait (7,1) is our body now, but will it be there next turn? Our body moves forward when we grow? Actually if we don't eat, our tail stays, body shifts. So (7,1) might become tail? Let's check: if we move RIGHT, our head to (7,0), body shifts: new body = [(6,0), (6,1), (7,1), ...]. So (7,1) is still occupied next turn! So UP would be suicide.

Enemy is stuck top-right, we dominate bottom-left!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Eat (5,0) now, then (5,1) next turn (if safe), then maybe (1,0) cluster. Grow to 14 quickly! Enemy will be at 14 or 15 by then. Once we're equal length, we can push towards them and force head-on collisions!

Instant throw. \u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- That\u2019s literally our neck, the square directly behind our head.  \n- Moving there is illegal/backwards = instant self-KO. \u274c\n\nSo only real candidates: **LEFT** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 RIGHT to (8,9) (apple)\n\n- (8,9) has an apple, no snake body there \u2192 safe *this* turn.\n- We eat, grow, tail stays put.\n\nBut then the shape is nasty:\n\nFrom (8,9) next turn:\n- LEFT \u2192 back into our neck (7,9) \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 into our own body at (8,8) \u274c\n- UP \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- Only move: **RIGHT \u2192 (9,9)** \u2705\n\nFrom (9,9):\n- LEFT \u2192 neck (8,9) \u274c\n- UP/RIGHT \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- Only move: **DOWN \u2192 (9,8)** \u2705\n\nThen:\n- From (9,8): only safe move is **DOWN \u2192 (9,7)**, then **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)**, etc.\n\nSo going RIGHT now forces us into a long one-lane chute down the right wall for several turns. It\u2019s not an immediate death, but:\n- Our options are super restricted for a while.\n- We\u2019re far from center, not really boxing the enemy at all.\n- We do farm apples later on that side (like (9,4)), but we\u2019re basically just joyriding the sideline.\n\nDoable, but not ideal when we\u2019re trying to dominate the *central* lanes and cage this dude.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc48 LEFT to (6,9)\n\n- (6,9) is empty \u2192 safe this turn.\n- No enemy anywhere near that square; they\u2019re chilling at (6,0).\n\nAfter moving LEFT, our body is:\n\nHead: (6,9)  \nThen: (7,9),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8)\n\nFrom (6,9) next turn:\n- RIGHT \u2192 neck (7,9) \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,8) looks empty, but stepping there gets us **completely surrounded** the turn after. It\u2019s a delayed suicide trap, so we must treat it as effectively unsafe.\n- Real safe continuation: **LEFT \u2192 (5,9)**\n\nFrom there we can slide:\n- 6,9 \u2192 5,9 \u2192 4,9 \u2026\n\nCrucial moment: when we hit **4,9**, the square below (4,8) is *no longer* part of our body (tail has moved).  \nSo at (4,9) we unlock multiple good options:\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8) opening us into the center top with **three** exits (left, right, down).  \n- Or keep going LEFT toward the apples at (2,9) and (0,9).\n\nThat\u2019s \ud83d\udd25 because:\n- We stay on the **top side directly above the enemy**, in central columns.\n- We can later drop a vertical wall down around x=4\u20136 to cut off their escape routes.\n- Our flexibility comes back quickly (within a couple turns), instead of being stuck along the far right boundary for ages.\n\nWe give up the immediate apple at (8,9), but top apples are basically ours whenever we want them; enemy is miles away. We already lead 12\u201310, so we don\u2019t need to greed the nearest fruit at the cost of position.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n- From **(6,9)**:\n  - DO NOT go DOWN to (6,8); that\u2019s a self-cage. Always avoid that pit.\n  - Slide LEFT along the top (5,9 \u2192 4,9).\n- Once at **4,9 (or 3,9)**:\n  - Start dropping DOWN into the center (4,8, 4,7, etc).\n  - Build a vertical wall somewhere around x=4\u20136 to seal the enemy under us.\n- Stay on the high side, keep a wide \u201cceiling\u201d over them, then look for chances to:\n  - Box them against the bottom wall.\n  - Or force them into a bad head-on if they\u2019re desperate to escape and we still have the apple lead.\n\nWe play positionally strong *now* so we can go for the kill box later. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Scoreboard says 12! So they're length 13 still. They didn't grow! HUGE!\n\nBOARD CHECK:\nOur body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)] \u2014 HEAD at (5, 0) (length 12)\nEnemy body: [(7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)] \u2014 HEAD at (6, 9) (length 13)\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER?

They can go DOWN or LEFT. Both safe, no apples adjacent. They might try to come down towards us? Or go for apples later.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS THIS TURN:\n- If we go UP to (5,1) and enemy goes DOWN to (6,8) \u2014 safe, far.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,0) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,9) \u2014 safe.\n- NO DIRECT SAME-CELL COLLISION POSSIBLE! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: WE HAVE AN APPLE AT (5,1)! Eating it grows us to 13 \u2014 TIE LENGTH WITH ENEMY! \ud83c\udfaf That's HUGE! Going LEFT to (4,0) is safe but no growth. We NEED that apple to equalize!\n\nWhich move sets up better?\n- **UP to (5,1):** Eat apple, grow to 13. Next turn head at (5,1). Possible moves: UP to (5,2) \u2014 empty, DOWN to (5,0) \u2014 empty (our old head), LEFT to (4,1) \u2014 empty, RIGHT to (6,1) \u2014 our body? Wait (6,1) is our body now, but after growth, body shifts: new body will include (6,0), (6,1), etc. So (6,1) still occupied next turn. So RIGHT would be suicide. So we'd have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe \u2014 3 options! Good flexibility! And we're longer, more threatening!\n- **LEFT to (4,0):** No growth. Next turn head at (4,0). Possible moves: UP to (4,1) \u2014 empty, DOWN off board, LEFT to (3,0) \u2014 APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT to (5,0) \u2014 empty. So 3 safe moves too, one leads to apple. But we stay shorter, enemy could grow later.\n\nEATING THE APPLE IS CRUCIAL! Equal length means we can force head-on collisions later and WIN if we have more apples (we will after eating!). We have 11 apples now, eating makes 12, enemy has 12. TIE! But we'll have momentum!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Eat (5,1) now \u2192 length 13. Enemy likely moves down/left. Next turn, we can consider pushing towards center or farming more apples bottom-left ((3,0), (1,0)). Keep building length advantage! Once we're longer, we can aggressively cut off enemy's space and force them into our body! They're trapped top-right with limited moves \u2014 we can slowly box them in!

NO APPLE AT (5,9) ON LAST BOARD! SO THEY'RE STILL 13 TOO! TIE GAME!)\n\nBOARD CHECK:\nOur body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)] \u2014 HEAD at (5, 1) (length 13)\nEnemy body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8)] \u2014 HEAD at (5, 9) (length 13)\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER? Enemy is 8 cells above us! No direct collision risk this turn unless we both move into same cell? Let's check!\n\nOUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (5,1):\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 2) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 0) \u2014 Our own body! \u274c SUICIDE! That's our neck!

TWO OPTIONS!\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (5,9):\n- UP \u2192 (5, 10) \u2014 OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nENEMY ONLY HAS LEFT TO (4,9) SAFE! THEY ARE TRAPPED! CHAT, THEY CAN ONLY GO LEFT! THIS IS HUGE! THEY HAVE NO OTHER LEGAL MOVE! THEY'RE BACKED INTO THE WALL! \ud83d\ude31\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS THIS TURN:\n- If we go UP to (5,2) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,9) \u2014 safe, far.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,1) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,9) \u2014 safe, far.\n- NO DIRECT COLLISION POSSIBLE! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: ENEMY IS FORCED LEFT! They will be at (4,9) next turn. That's top-left corner area. We are at bottom-center. We need to plan to BOX THEM IN! They have limited escape routes top-left. We can start moving UP to cut off their descent!\n\nWhich move sets up better?\n- **UP to (5,2):** Moves us toward center, opens future moves: UP to (5,3) empty, LEFT to (4,2) empty, RIGHT to (6,2) our body? Wait (6,2) is our body now \u2014 so next turn RIGHT would be suicide. So UP gives us UP, LEFT safe next turn? Actually from (5,2): UP (5,3) empty, DOWN (5,1) empty (our old head), LEFT (4,2) empty, RIGHT (6,2) body. So 3 safe moves! Good!\n- **LEFT to (4,1):** Moves us left toward apple at (3,0) or (1,0). From (4,1): UP (4,2) empty, DOWN (4,0) empty, LEFT (3,1) empty, RIGHT (5,1) empty (old head). So 4 safe moves! Actually all four might be safe! That's MAX FLEXIBILITY! And we're closer to bottom apples!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Enemy forced left to (4,9). They might try to go down later through (4,8) but that's their body. They'll be stuck in top-left corner. We should move UP to start cutting off the board center and limit their space. But moving LEFT gives us more options and farms apples bottom-left. HMM... CHAT, WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! They're trapped! Let's move UP to claim center and pressure them! If we go LEFT we're just farming while they're weak. NO! WE GO UP AND START THE BOX! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Time to lock this position in and not throw.\n\nOur full snake right now:\n\n- Head: (5,9)  \n- Body: (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8) [tail]\n\nEnemy:\n\n- Head: (5,1)  \n- Body: (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) [tail]\n\nWe must pick one of: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (5,9).\n\n---\n\n### Check all 4 directions\n\n**1) UP \u2192 (5,10)**  \nOff the board immediately. Instant death.  \n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n**2) RIGHT \u2192 (6,9)**  \nThat\u2019s our neck segment. Moving directly backwards into your own neck is explicitly forbidden.  \n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n**3) DOWN \u2192 (5,8)**  \n(5,8) is currently one of our body segments (not the tail).\n\n- Tail is at (4,8), so even after movement, (5,8) remains part of our body.\n- Moving the head onto any non-tail body segment is a self-collision.\n\nSo DOWN is an immediate self-hit.  \n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n**4) LEFT \u2192 (4,9)**  \nCheck the cell:\n\n- Board at (4,9) is empty.\n- Not in our body, not in enemy body.\n- Enemy head at (5,1) is 8 rows below; he cannot contest that square this turn.\n\nSo LEFT is safe **this** turn.\n\nNow, do we get trapped if we go there? Let\u2019s simulate.\n\n---\n\n### After moving LEFT to (4,9)\n\nWe do **not** eat an apple at (4,9), so our tail moves forward.\n\nNew snake:\n\n- Head: (4,9)\n- Body: (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8)\n- Tail: (5,8)\n\n(4,8) is now empty; we\u2019ve opened some space directly under us.\n\nNext-turn options from that new head position (4,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,10): off-board \u2192 illegal\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,9): neck \u2192 illegal\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8): just vacated tail, will be empty \u2192 safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,9): currently empty \u2192 safe\n\nSo by going LEFT now, we guarantee at least **two** safe options next turn (LEFT or DOWN). No deathbox, no forced suicide. Exactly what we want.\n\nAlso, we maintain a solid \u201cceiling\u201d above the enemy; we control the entire top-center while they\u2019re still fighting over the bottom lanes.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan note to future me\n\n- This turn: **go LEFT to (4,9)** \u2014 it\u2019s the only legal move and keeps us flexible.\n- Next few turns from the new head at (4,9):\n  - Strong candidate line: continue **LEFT** along the top to (3,9) and then toward the apples at (2,9) and (0,9) to grow a size lead, while always preserving at least one downward exit.\n  - Alternatively, if enemy starts pushing upward aggressively, consider dropping **DOWN** from around columns 3\u20134 to build a vertical wall in the mid-left, cutting off their routes into the top half.\n- Priority: stay alive, grow slightly ahead, then use the length advantage to threaten or force a head-on collision when we\u2019re clearly longer.\n\nGiven all that, there is exactly one safe and strategically sound move this turn:\n\nLEFT",

TWO OPTIONS!\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,9):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 10) \u2014 OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 8) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE! (Part of their tail? Wait (4,8) is in their body? YES! Their body list includes (5,8) and (5,9) but NOT (4,8)? Actually check: enemy body: [(5,9), (6,9), ... (5,8)] \u2014 (4,8) is NOT listed! Is it empty? Look at board: row 9 col 4 is '0' head, row 8 col 4 is '.' empty! So (4,8) is EMPTY! Wait, is (4,8) empty? Board shows at (4,8): row 8, col 4 is '.'! YES! So DOWN to (4,8) is SAFE! CHAT, THEY HAVE DOWN AS OPTION! MY BAD! They also have:\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 9) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nSo enemy has DOWN to (4,8) and LEFT to (3,9) as safe moves! TWO OPTIONS! They are not as trapped as I thought!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS THIS TURN:\n- If we go UP to (5,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,8) \u2014 safe, far.\n- If we go UP to (5,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,9) \u2014 safe, far.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,8) \u2014 same column but 6 cells apart, safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,2) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,9) \u2014 safe, far.\nNO DIRECT COLLISION POSSIBLE! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: Enemy can go DOWN to (4,8) which opens more escape routes! They might try to loop down left side. We need to CUT THEM OFF! We should move UP to start walling off the center and limit their descent! If we go LEFT we're just farming bottom apples while they gain space! NO! AGGRESSIVE BOXING TIME!\n\nWHICH MOVE SETS UP BETTER?\n- **UP to (5,3):** Moves us toward center. From (5,3): UP (5,4) our body? Wait (5,4) is our body! So UP would be suicide next turn! DOWN (5,2) empty (old head), LEFT (4,3) empty, RIGHT (6,3) our body! So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn? That's risky! Hmm...\n- **LEFT to (4,2):** From (4,2): UP (4,3) empty, DOWN (4,1) empty, LEFT (3,2) empty (apple at (3,2)? Actually apple at (3,2) is on board! YES! That's an apple!), RIGHT (5,2) empty (old head). So ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS SAFE NEXT TURN! And we can grab apple at (3,2) if we go LEFT now then LEFT again next turn? Actually apple at (3,2) is two left from current head? We're at (5,2), apple at (3,2). If we go LEFT to (4,2), then next turn LEFT to (3,2) gets apple! That's GROWTH! And we maintain flexibility!\n\nCHAT, LEFT GIVES US MORE OPTIONS AND A PATH TO AN APPLE! UP TRAPS US A BIT! BUT WE WANT TO BOX ENEMY! Enemy is top-left, if we go left we're also moving left, maybe we can cut off their descent by moving up later? Actually we need to get ABOVE them to limit them! Going left doesn't help that! Going up gets us higher! But going up limits our next moves... HARD CHOICE!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Enemy likely will go DOWN to (4,8) to avoid being cornered. Then they might go further down. We need to move UP to claim row 3, row 4, and cut off their path down the left side. But we also need to grow to maintain length tie! Apple at (3,2) is tempting! If we go LEFT now, we can get apple next turn and still move up after? Let's think: LEFT to (4,2), then next turn maybe UP to (4,3) to start moving up? That keeps options open. Going UP now might make us vulnerable to being trapped ourselves!\n\nSAFETY FIRST! LEFT gives maximum flexibility and an apple path! Let's take LEFT and farm while keeping enemy in check! We can still move up next turn to cut them off! \n\nLEFT",

Goal: stay alive, build a lead, then crush them.\n\nLet\u2019s run the options from (4,9):\n\n### 1) UP \u2192 (4,10)\n- Off the 10x10 board.\n- Instant death.\n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n### 2) RIGHT \u2192 (5,9)\n- That\u2019s our neck segment.\n- Moving directly backward into your own neck is always fatal.\n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n### 3) DOWN \u2192 (4,8)\n- (4,8) is currently empty (no body, no apple, no enemy).\n- Not our neck, not off-board, not into any snake.\n- Enemy head at (5,2) is far away and can\u2019t interact with this square this turn.\n- Next turn from (4,8), we\u2019d have three likely safe options: LEFT (3,8), DOWN (4,7), RIGHT (5,8) \u2014 our current tail that will vacate.\n\u2192 **Safe this turn**, with good follow-up flexibility.\n\n### 4) LEFT \u2192 (3,9)\n- (3,9) is empty: not in our body, not in enemy body, no apple.\n- Not neck, not off-board, no possible head-on with the enemy this turn.\n- After moving, our tail moves from (5,8) to (5,7). New snake head at (3,9), body stretching across the top from x=4\u20137.\n- Next turn from (3,9), we\u2019ll have two safe moves: LEFT to (2,9) (apple), or DOWN to (3,8). No trap.\n\nSo the **only illegal moves** are UP and RIGHT. Both LEFT and DOWN are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Choosing between LEFT and DOWN\n\n**DOWN (4,8)**:\n- Drops us toward the mid-board near the enemy\u2019s future routes.\n- Gives three follow-up options next turn and starts bringing us into the contested center.\n- But we\u2019re still tied in apples; diving toward them now invites risky engagements and possible head-on draws before we build a length advantage.\n\n**LEFT (3,9)**:\n- Extends our \u201cceiling\u201d along the top row.\n- Sets us up to grab the free apple at (2,9) next, then potentially (0,9) later, without any contest from the enemy.\n- Safe spatially: enemy can\u2019t reach the top any time soon due to our existing wall at x=5\u20138 and their current low position.\n- Strengthens our positional dominance: we\u2019ll own more of the top edge, making it even harder for them to ever break out upward.\n\nGiven we\u2019re **tied** in score and already control the high ground, the best play is to:\n- Stay safe,\n- Consolidate top control, and\n- Farm the uncontested top apples to gain a length and score lead before dropping down to pressure/box them.\n\nThat all points to moving **LEFT** now.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me\n\n- Keep extending our top-row wall and scoop up the apples along the top edge to get a clear length advantage.\n- Once we\u2019re comfortably ahead in apples and length, start dropping down from the left side to build a vertical wall that joins our existing mass on the right, shrinking the enemy\u2019s playable area.\n- With a length lead, look for chances to threaten or force a head-on when they\u2019re short on space, since a collision will then favor us.\n\nLEFT",

They will likely go for the apple at (2,9) to grow and break tie! WE CAN'T LET THEM GET THAT ADVANTAGE! But we can't stop them directly... unless we force a head-on collision? Let's check collision risks:\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN:\n- If we go LEFT to (3,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (3,8) \u2014 same column, far apart, safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (3,2) and enemy goes LEFT to (2,9) \u2014 different columns, safe.\n- If we go UP to (4,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (2,9) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (4,1) and enemy goes LEFT to (2,9) \u2014 safe.\nNO DIRECT COLLISION POSSIBLE! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: Enemy going LEFT to (2,9) gets them an apple, making them length 14 vs our 13 if we don't grow! THAT'S BAD! We need to grow THIS TURN to match! We have an apple at (3,2) \u2014 LEFT gets it! That keeps us tied at 13 each after growth! If we go UP or DOWN, we stay 13 and they likely become 14! THEN THEY HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION! We can't let that happen!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating apple at (3,2), we become length 14. Enemy likely also length 14 if they eat (2,9). Then it's still even! But we need to start cutting off their escape from the top-left corner. They'll be at (2,9) or (3,8). We should move NORTH to get above them and limit their movement. Next turn from (3,2), we can go UP to (3,3) to start moving up the left side, threatening to wall them off. We must be aggressive!\n\nWHAT ABOUT DOWN? Down to (4,1) avoids apple, keeps us short, BAD. UP to (4,3) avoids apple, also bad. LEFT is the ONLY move that grows us and keeps tie!\n\nCHECK FUTURE OPTIONS FROM (3,2) after eating apple (new tail? our tail is at (5,5) \u2014 after growth, tail stays there, body adds segment at old head (4,2) becomes new neck? Actually after eating, new head at (3,2), old head (4,2) becomes second segment, tail stays same until we move next turn. So from (3,2) next turn, our body will include (4,2) and all current body except tail maybe? Let's think: after growth, our body list will be: head (3,2), then (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), ... up to tail (5,5). So from (3,2) next turn, possible moves:\n- UP (3,3) \u2014 empty? Board shows (3,3) is '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (3,1) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- LEFT (2,2) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT (4,2) \u2014 our own body! \u274c\nSo three safe moves again! Good flexibility!\n\nENEMY after eating apple at (2,9) will have head at (2,9), body includes (3,9), (4,9), etc. They'll be longer too. We need to pressure them!\n\nCHAT, LEFT IS THE MOVE!

Now the real question:\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move is better for domination?\n\nWe\u2019re tied in apples at 12\u201312. To win a collision later, we want:\n- More length\n- More space control\n\n**DOWN (3,8):**\n- Pros:\n  - 3 follow-up options (more local flexibility).\n  - Starts moving us toward the central lane, where we can eventually pressure them.\n- Cons:\n  - We walk away from a totally free apple.\n  - We don\u2019t extend our top \u201cceiling\u201d that\u2019s currently locking them below.\n  - No immediate score/length advantage, so we\u2019re not setting up a favorable head-on yet.\n\n**LEFT (2,9):**\n- Pros:\n  - Immediate +1 apple \u2192 we go up **13\u201312**. Huge for future head-on threats \ud83d\udcaa\n  - We extend our top wall from x=2\u21927 on y=9, solidifying our choke across the upper board.\n  - Enemy is nowhere near contesting this apple or this row.\n  - Still good future options:\n    - LEFT to (1,9) to continue sweeping toward the (0,9) apple.\n    - DOWN to (2,8) to start dropping into the center **after** we\u2019ve secured top resources.\n- Cons:\n  - Only 2 follow-up directions instead of 3. But both are open and spacious; no real risk of getting boxed in yet.\n\nGiven:\n- We **want** a length/score lead to threaten or accept head-on collisions later.\n- We **already** dominate the top side; reinforcing that control is how we eventually box them in from above.\n- The enemy cannot interfere with us grabbing this apple.\n\nThe aggressive, winning line is to **take the free apple on the left and keep building the ceiling.**\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- This turn: **LEFT to (2,9)** and eat that apple. Take the lead: 13\u201312.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Likely continue **LEFT \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9)** to scoop the corner apple and fully lock down the top edge from x=0\u20137.\n  - Once we\u2019ve milked the top-left for value, start dropping **down the left side** (from around x=1\u20132) to build a vertical wall that connects with our existing mass on the right.\n  - The goal: shrink their playground from below while we stay big and safe above.\n- When we\u2019re clearly longer and they\u2019re cramped, actively look for:\n  - Forcing routes where their best \u201cescape\u201d is a head-on collision into us.\n  - If we\u2019re significantly ahead, we\u2019ll happily trade in a head-on because equal-head crash favors the longer snake in terms of final apple count.\n\nWe farm now, we strangle later.

That's our neck! CAN'T!\n\nSO THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT! NICE!\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (2,9):\n- UP \u2192 (2, 10) \u2014 OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2014 APPLE 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND GROWTH FOR THEM!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nSo enemy has DOWN to (2,8) and LEFT to (1,9) (apple!). They will likely go for the apple at (1,9) to get length 15 vs our 14! THAT'S BAD! We need to either grow too or force a head-on collision while we're still tied!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN:\n- If we go UP to (3,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (1,9) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,1) and enemy goes LEFT to (1,9) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,2) and enemy goes LEFT to (1,9) \u2014 safe.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (2,8) \u2014 safe.\nNO DIRECT COLLISION POSSIBLE! Good.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: Enemy going LEFT to (1,9) gets them an apple, making them length 15 vs our 14! WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN! We need to either grow ourselves or cut off their future movement! Nearest apples to us: (3,0) and (1,0) and (1,5) etc. Too far to reach this turn. So we can't grow this turn unless we move onto an apple\u2014none adjacent. So we must think about positioning to force a head-on collision NEXT turn while we're still tied in length! If they grow to 15, they win head-on collisions! So we need to threaten a collision path that forces them to avoid, maybe trap them!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to move UP to get closer to the enemy and start boxing them in the top-left corner! From (3,2), UP to (3,3) puts us moving toward the center-left. Next turn we could go UP again to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,3) to continue walling off. Enemy at (1,9) or (2,8) will be stuck near the top edge. We can try to snake up the left side and cut off their escape downward. If we go DOWN or LEFT, we're moving away from the enemy, giving them more space to dominate the board! AGGRESSION IS KEY!\n\nCHECK FUTURE OPTIONS FROM (3,3) next turn:\n- UP (3,4) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (3,2) \u2014 our old head, but after moving, that cell becomes our body? Wait, after moving to (3,3), our body will be: head (3,3), then (3,2), then (4,2)... So DOWN to (3,2) would be our own body! \u274c So DOWN would be unsafe next turn! That's a risk, but we can avoid it by not going DOWN next turn.\n- LEFT (2,3) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT (4,3) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\nSo from (3,3) we'd have three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,2) now, that's moving away from enemy, and from (2,2) next turn we could go UP to (2,3) etc. But that's slower to pressure.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,1), that's moving toward bottom apples but away from enemy\u2014giving them more control.\n\nCHAT, THE MOVE IS **UP**! We advance toward the enemy, keep pressure, and set up for a potential head-on collision next turn if they move down toward us! We must maintain length parity\u2014if they eat the apple at (1,9), they'll be longer, so we need to force a collision BEFORE they grow! Actually they grow immediately when they move onto apple, so they'll be longer after this turn. So we need to avoid head-on collisions until we can grow too! So we should avoid moving directly into their possible path. They're at (2,9), moving likely LEFT to (1,9). That's far from us. So UP is safe and aggressive!\n\nLET'S GO UP AND START THE BOXING MANEUVER! NEXT TURN WE'LL ASSESS HOW TO CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE!\n\nUP",

Now if we ever want a head-on, we *want* the trade \ud83d\ude08\n  - We extend our top wall further left, approaching a full horizontal choke from x=0 to x=7 on y=9.\n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach this region for many, many turns \u2014 this is free real estate.\n  - Next turn we can:\n    - LEFT again \u2192 (0,9) for another apple and hard corner, **or**\n    - DOWN \u2192 (1,8) to start descending the left side earlier if we want more space.\n- Cons:\n  - Only 2 safe next moves instead of 3, but both are into wide-open territory; no real risk of self-boxing yet.\n\nGiven:\n- We\u2019re tied right now and **want** a length / score lead to win any future collision.\n- The top row is **ours**, completely uncontested.\n- Taking apples here strengthens both our board control *and* our win condition (length).\n\nThe aggressive, high-EV play is crystal clear: **take the free apple and stretch that ceiling.**\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term evil plan for future me \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udcdc\n\n- This turn: **LEFT to (1,9)**, grab the apple, go up 14\u201313.\n- Next turns (if the board doesn\u2019t change drastically):\n  - Likely **LEFT again to (0,9)** to scoop the corner apple and fully cap the top-left.\n  - From (0,9), start slithering **DOWN the left edge**, building a massive vertical wall.\n  - Eventually, connect that left-side wall with our current right/top cluster around (6\u20138,6\u20139), creating a huge enclosure.\n- Goal: squeeze enemy into a shrinking bottom-right box:\n  - Strip their escape routes one by one.\n  - Force them into either:\n    - Running out of space and crashing into our body, or\n    - Taking a desperate head-on where we\u2019re longer and favored.\n\nWe\u2019re farming now so we can execute the checkmate later.

THEY'RE NOW LONGER! \ud83d\ude31)\n\nSCORE: US 13 \u2014 THEM 14. THEY HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! THAT MEANS IF WE GO HEAD-ON COLLISION, WE DIE AND THEY SURVIVE! WE MUST AVOID DIRECT HEAD-TO-HEAD UNTIL WE GROW!\n\nBOARD CHECK \u2014 OUR BODY: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)] \u2014 HEAD at (3,3)\nENEMY BODY: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7)] \u2014 HEAD at (1,9)\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER? CHECK OUR MOVES FROM (3,3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 4) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 2) \u2014 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE! That's our neck! CAN'T!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 3) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n\nSO THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, RIGHT! DOWN IS DEATH!\n\nENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (1,9):\n- UP \u2192 (1, 10) \u2014 OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2014 Empty '.' \u2705 SAFE\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) \u2014 APPLE 'A' \u2705 SAFE AND GROWTH FOR THEM! (LENGTH 16!)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2014 Their own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nSo enemy likely goes LEFT to (0,9) for apple, or DOWN to (1,8). They'll probably take the apple to extend lead!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\n- If we go UP to (3,4), enemy goes LEFT/DOWN \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go LEFT to (2,3), enemy goes LEFT/DOWN \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,3), enemy goes LEFT/DOWN \u2014 no collision.\nALL SAFE FROM INSTANT COLLISION. GOOD.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: THEY'RE LONGER, SO WE CAN'T RISK HEAD-ON. WE NEED TO GROW ASAP TO CATCH UP! NEAREST APPLES TO US: (3,0) is 3 steps down, (1,0) is 2 left + 3 down, (1,5) is 2 left + 2 up, (1,6) is 2 left + 3 up. Also (0,4) is 3 left + 1 up. WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARD AN APPLE WHILE BOXING THEM IN!\n\nLOOK AT BOARD: Enemy is top-left corner (1,9). If they eat apple at (0,9), they'll be even longer and stuck in that corner more. We can move to cut off their escape downward! Our position (3,3) \u2014 if we go LEFT to (2,3), we're moving toward left wall and can go up to (2,4) next to maybe block them from coming down the left side. If we go UP to (3,4), we're moving toward center, maybe less blocking. If we go RIGHT to (4,3), we're moving away from enemy and apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to trap enemy in top-left while we grow. Let's head toward apple at (1,5) or (1,6) via LEFT then UP moves. From (2,3), next turn we can go UP to (2,4) (safe), then LEFT to (1,4) (should be safe), then UP to (1,5) for apple! That's 3 turns to grow. Meanwhile enemy might be stuck up top.\n\nCHECK FUTURE OPTIONS FROM (2,3) next turn:\n- UP (2,4) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (2,2) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705 (our body moves away)\n- LEFT (1,3) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT (3,3) \u2014 will be our body after this move? Wait, if we move to (2,3), our body becomes: head (2,3), then (3,3), then (3,2)... So RIGHT to (3,3) would be our own body! \u274c So RIGHT would be unsafe next turn. But we have other moves.\n\nFrom (3,4) next turn:\n- UP (3,5) \u2014 apple 'A'? Actually (3,5) is apple? Board shows (3,5) is 'A'? Yes! Apple at (3,5)! That's HUGE! If we go UP to (3,4) now, next turn we can go UP to (3,5) and GROW! That catches us up to 14 vs their 15 (or 16 if they eat now). That's FAST GROWTH!\n\nCHAT, BIG BRAIN TIME! \ud83e\udde0 If we go UP to (3,4) now, we set up to eat apple at (3,5) next turn! That's the quickest growth path! And it's safe this turn. Meanwhile enemy might eat apple at (0,9) and grow to 16, but we'd grow to 15 next turn \u2014 still behind by 1, but closer!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,3), we're moving away from that apple (3,5). That's slower growth.\n\nSO THE MOVE IS **UP**! Get to (3,4), then next turn UP to (3,5) for the apple! That's CONTENT! And we're still applying pressure toward the top!\n\nLET'S GO UP AND SECURE THAT APPLE NEXT TURN! WE CATCH UP AND THEN WE CAN FIGHT FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN LENGTHS ARE EQUAL!\n\nUP",

Toss it.\n\n2) LEFT from (0,9) \u2192 (-1,9)  \n   - Also off-board. Auto-lose. No shot.\n\n3) RIGHT from (0,9) \u2192 (1,9)  \n   - That\u2019s our own body segment directly behind the head (the neck). Moving there is backwards into ourselves \u2192 illegal / death. Out.\n\n4) DOWN from (0,9) \u2192 (0,8)  \n   - Check the board: (0,8) is empty, no apple, no body (ours or theirs), and inside bounds.  \n   - Enemy head at (3,4) is nowhere near (0,8) this turn, so no head-on risk.\n\nSo this turn is actually simple: the **only** move that keeps us alive is **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\nShort-term plan for future me:\n- This turn: go **DOWN** to (0,8), starting the slide down the left wall.\n- From (0,8), we\u2019ll likely keep working down and/or step right around rows 7\u20135 to start building a big outer shell: top edge already ours, we add a left edge, and later connect to our mass on the right side.\n- Goal: gradually fence the enemy into the lower-right / mid-right zone.

They might try to slide down the left wall. WE NEED TO BLOCK THEM!\n\nIF WE GO UP AND EAT THE APPLE, OUR HEAD GOES TO (3,5), OUR TAIL EXTENDS (WE GROW), SO OUR BODY BLOCKS MORE SPACE. FROM (3,5) NEXT TURN, WE CAN GO LEFT TOWARD (2,5) (ANOTHER APPLE!) OR CONTINUE UP/LEFT TO CUT OFF ENEMY'S PATH DOWN.\n\nIF WE GO LEFT TO (2,4), WE'RE CLOSER TO LEFT WALL, MAYBE BETTER FOR BLOCKING, BUT WE DELAY GROWTH. WE NEED TO CATCH UP IN LENGTH TO CONTEST HEAD-ON!\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT TO (4,4), WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM ENEMY AND APPLIES \u2014 BAD.\n\nBIG BRAIN TIME! \ud83e\udde0 THE APPLE AT (3,5) IS RIGHT ABOVE US! FREE GROWTH! THAT'S CONTENT! EATING IT NOW GETS US CLOSER IN LENGTH, AND WE CAN IMMEDIATELY THREATEN THE APPLE AT (2,5) NEXT TURN! THAT'S TWO APPLIES IN TWO TURNS IF WE PLAY IT RIGHT! THAT WOULD TIE THE SCORE 15-15! LET'S GOOO!\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: AFTER EATING (3,5), GO LEFT TO (2,5) FOR APPLE, THEN POSSIBLY DOWN TO (2,4) TO CUT OFF ENEMY'S DESCENT. ENEMY IS STUCK AT (0,8) THEN (0,7) \u2014 WE CAN CREATE A WALL WITH OUR BODY!\n\nCHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR \u2014 **UP** TO EAT THAT APPLE, GROW, AND START THE COMEBACK!

THAT WOULD PUT US AHEAD 16-15! LET'S GOOO!\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: THEY'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN TO (0,7) TO AVOID GETTING BOXED. FROM (0,7) NEXT, THEY CAN ONLY GO DOWN OR RIGHT. WE CAN CREATE A WALL WITH OUR BODY ALONG LEFT SIDE!\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: AFTER EATING (2,5), GO DOWN TO (2,4) TO BLOCK, THEN POSSIBLY LEFT TO (1,4) OR (1,5) FOR MORE APPLES.

We wanna stay alive, stay long, and start boxing this dude in.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check ALL four moves\n\n**UP** from (0,8) \u2192 (0,9)  \n- That\u2019s our own body segment right behind us. Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n- Illegal / suicide \u2192 \u274c\n\n**LEFT** from (0,8) \u2192 (-1,8)  \n- Off the board. Out of bounds = dead. \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** from (0,8) \u2192 (1,8)  \n- Board shows (1,8) is empty: safe this turn \u2705  \n- No body, no apple, in bounds.  \n- Next turn from (1,8), safe neighbours would be:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,7) (open)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,8) (open)  \n  - UP hits our own body at (1,9), LEFT hits our body at (0,8).  \n- So RIGHT is *playable*, gives us 2 decent outs, but keeps us hugging our own top wall more tightly, which can make future boxing/mobility trickier.\n\n**DOWN** from (0,8) \u2192 (0,7)  \n- Board at (0,7) is empty \u2705  \n- No risk of simultaneous head-on: enemy head is at (3,5); in one move they can only reach (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5), none are (0,7).  \n- After this, our body shifts down the left edge, tail (6,7) vacates, and from (0,7) next turn we\u2019d have:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,6) (open)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) (open)  \n- Nice, clean, spacious options.\n\nSo **SAFE moves this turn: RIGHT, DOWN.**\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy: which safe move is better?\n\nWe\u2019re trying to:\n- Stay alive (non-negotiable \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\udde0off),\n- Grow to keep our length + score edge,\n- And **dominate space** to eventually *box the enemy in*.\n\nLook at the board shape:\n\n- We already own almost the entire **top row** (0\u20137,9) and a chunk around the upper-right (7\u20138,8/7/6, and 6\u20137/6). That\u2019s like a big ceiling over the board.\n- The enemy is mostly clumped in the **lower-middle/right** around x=3\u20137, y=0\u20135.\n- The huge open region is below us and to the left/middle.\n\nTo box them, we want a big outer shell:\n- Top edge: we already have it \ud83d\ude0e\n- Next step: extend a **left wall downward** along x=0,\n- Later, sweep across the bottom,\n- Then connect into our existing right-side chunks to shrink their space until they have nowhere safe to go.\n\n**RIGHT to (1,8)**:\n- Keeps us near our top wall.\n- Still safe, but increases the risk in future that we\u2019re weaving too close to our own top line, making self-traps more likely as we get longer.\n- Less direct progress toward forming that left vertical wall.\n\n**DOWN to (0,7)**:\n- Starts building that **left-side wall** immediately.\n- Puts us at the edge of a HUGE free region below and inside us, giving tons of future routing options.\n- Lines us up nicely to drop further down toward all those juicy left-side / low apples (0,6 \u2192 0,5 \u2192 0,4, etc.) while our tail keeps freeing space behind.\n- Keeps our \u201cceiling\u201d at y=9 intact while we begin carving the left boundary. Perfect boxing geometry.\n\nWe\u2019re already ahead 15\u201314. We don\u2019t need to flip the map fast; we just need to keep them constrained while we stay safe and long. **DOWN** does exactly that, with no immediate risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcd3\n\n- This turn: **DOWN to (0,7)** to start the left wall.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Likely continue **down the left edge** (0,6 \u2192 0,5 \u2192 0,4) unless enemy positioning gives us a tasty tactical turn-in.\n  - Use that left column as a spine, then eventually swing RIGHT across the lower rows to start closing the box under them.\n- Always watch for a moment where they\u2019re forced along a predictable corridor toward our body: if we can line up a head-on and we still hold a score lead, we can go for the trade and win on apples.\n\nDOWN",

INSTEAD, GO DOWN TO (1,4) TO SAFELY EXTEND.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 WHAT IF WE GO UP TO (2,6) THIS TURN? NO GROWTH, BUT POSITIONS US TO BLOCK TOP. ENEMY LIKELY EATS (1,7) APPLE AND GROWS. THEN WE'RE AT (2,6), THEY AT (1,7). WE CAN GO LEFT TO (1,6) APPLE NEXT TURN \u2014 BUT THAT'S RISKY IF THEY GO DOWN TO (1,6) TOO. HMM.\n\nCHAT, THE SAFEST GROWTH MOVE IS LEFT TO (1,5) \u2014 GET AHEAD IN SCORE! THEN NEXT TURN, GO DOWN TO (1,4) TO AVOID POTENTIAL HEAD-ON. THAT EXTENDS OUR BODY AND BLOCKS LEFT SIDE. ENEMY WILL BE AT (1,7) WITH LENGTH 16, WE LENGTH 17. WE CAN THEN MANEUVER TO BOX THEM.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: AFTER EATING (1,5), GO DOWN TO (1,4). THEN POSSIBLY LEFT TO (0,4) APPLE OR DOWN TO (1,3). FORCE ENEMY INTO UPPER RIGHT CORNER. USE OUR BODY AS WALL.\n\nLEFT TO (1,5) IS THE MOVE! CONTENT AND AGGRESSIVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

None of those are (0,6), so no surprise head-on.  \n- After that, we\u2019d have at least:\n  - (0,5) and (1,6) as good follow-ups.\n- **Safe and extends our left wall down.**\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1,7)  \n- That\u2019s an APPLE at (1,7) \ud83c\udf4e  \n- Not occupied by any body, in bounds \u2705  \n- Enemy head can\u2019t get there this turn (too far: they\u2019re at (2,5)).  \n- We GROW and go to **16 apples** (unless they also eat, we at least don\u2019t fall behind).  \n- From new head (1,7), next turn we\u2019ll have:\n  - (1,8) empty,\n  - (1,6) apple,\n  - (2,7) empty,  \n  giving us **three** good options, though we\u2019ll avoid any obvious head-on contests.\n- Our existing left \u201cwall\u201d at x=0 (0,7\u20130,9) still exists; we\u2019re just thickening our control in the upper-left/mid.\n\nSo **safe moves this turn: DOWN and RIGHT.**\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move fits the game plan?\n\nWhat\u2019s our win condition, chat?  \n- Stay alive \u2705  \n- Get **apple lead** so we can win trades \ud83d\udca3  \n- Gradually **box this dude in** so he runs out of space.\n\n**If we go DOWN to (0,6):**\n- Nice positional play, extends the left boundary.  \n- But the enemy almost surely slides **LEFT to (1,5)** for a free apple.  \n- That puts the score at **15\u201316** in *their* favor \u2014 now *they* get to like head-on trades more than we do. Not ideal.\n\n**If we go RIGHT to (1,7):**\n- We grab the apple at (1,7).  \n- Enemy likely grabs the apple at (1,5).  \n- That keeps the score **tied at 16\u201316**, or at worst we don\u2019t fall behind.  \n- We also secure a super-strong posture in the upper-left corridor:\n  - From (1,7) we can pivot **up** toward the huge open top middle,\n  - Or **down/right** later to start curving around the enemy cluster.\n- We keep multiple safe follow-up paths and we\u2019re sitting directly above a chain of future apples at (1,6), (1,5), and then into the lower-left zone.\n\nRIGHT both:\n- Maximizes immediate value (apple now),  \n- Keeps us flexible with **three** future outs,  \n- Maintains or improves our scoring position so we can later **force a winning head-on** when the time is right.\n\nDOWN is solid positional, but it hands tempo on apples to the opponent. We\u2019re not giving that up, are we chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (long-term plan \ud83d\udcd3)\n\n- After moving RIGHT to **(1,7)**:\n  - Use the column 1 corridor to farm apples **without** walking into obvious head-on at (1,6) if they\u2019re directly below us.\n  - Favor moves that keep us as a **thick ceiling** above them while we gradually work down and around their cluster.\n  - Watch for moments where we have **apple lead** and can deliberately steer toward a favorable head-on corridor (especially central columns) to end the game on our terms.\n- Keep expanding our outer shell: top \u2192 upper-left/center \u2192 then eventually sweeping **down and under** them for a real box-in.\n\nTime to chomp and keep the pressure \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

In bounds, so locally safe.  \n- This is the hot square: enemy can also choose UP \u2192 (1,6).  \n- Outcomes if we go DOWN (1,6):\n\n  Enemy choices from (1,5):\n  - UP to (1,6): both heads collide on the apple \u2192 double KO, likely 17\u201317 draw.\n  - DOWN to (1,4): they take the lower apple, we take the upper apple \u2192 17\u201317 tie, game continues.\n  - LEFT to (0,5): they don\u2019t score, we do \u2192 we lead 17\u201316, and they\u2019re by the left wall, closer to being boxed in.\n\nSo DOWN is:\n- Slight risk of immediate draw (if they also go UP),\n- Otherwise either maintains parity or gives us the lead while putting us just above and to the side of them in a great boxing posture.\n\nGiven they want to win, not draw, UP-for-draw is a pretty unattractive choice for them compared to just taking a different apple and keeping the game alive.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Compare strategic value\n\n- **UP**: Keeps score 16\u201316 this turn but cripples our future options to basically one move. Bad for long-term boxing.\n- **RIGHT**: Safest and most flexible, but we likely allow them to grab an apple and go 17\u201316 ahead (either at (1,6) or (1,4)). That gives them the first rights to a favorable head-on later. We don\u2019t want to hand them that for free.\n- **DOWN**: Fights for the central apple, preserves or gains score advantage in all non-suicidal enemy choices, and keeps decent future options (LEFT and RIGHT next turn) to start wrapping around them.\n\nWe\u2019re here to dominate, not to let them walk into a comfy apple lead. The small chance of a draw via simultaneous UP is an acceptable risk compared to giving up tempo and scoreboard pressure.\n\nDOWN also keeps us stacked above their region, letting us build a ceiling over their head and then slide left/right to start sealing the box.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Short long-term plan note for future me\n\n- After moving DOWN to (1,6):\n  - Prioritize moving to (0,6) or (2,6) to form a horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d just above their cluster.\n  - Use the left wall (x=0) as an anchor: push down alongside it if they drift left, forcing them into a shrinking pocket under our body.\n  - Keep collecting safe apples while maintaining a solid shell around their occupied quadrant.\n  - As soon as we secure a clear apple lead, start steering engagements so any forced corridor battle favors a winning head-on for us.\n\nDOWN",

We **cannot** afford any losing coinflip head-ons yet.\n\nBoard reminders near us:\n\n- Our segments nearby: (1,6), (1,7), (0,7), \u2026 and to the right/top.\n- Enemy belt is mostly around y=2\u20135, x=1\u20137.\n- Huge apple at (3,7) just above/right of us.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate all four moves\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,6)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck. Moving directly back = instant death. **Illegal.**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,5)**  \n  That\u2019s enemy body. Moving into any body = we die, they live. **Suicide.**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,7)**  \n  Currently empty. No enemy can reach it this turn (they\u2019re at (0,4), can only go to (0,5) or (0,3)). So **immediately safe**.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  Also empty. Enemy cannot jump there this turn either. So **immediately safe**.\n\nSo the only candidates: **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Look one step ahead for each safe move\n\n### If we go UP to (2,7)\n\n- Next turn from (2,7), our safe moves (ignoring enemy for a second):\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (3,7)**: apple, safe.\n  - **UP \u2192 (2,8)**: empty, safe.\n  - LEFT/DOWN both hit our own body.\n\n- Enemy from (0,4):\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,3)**: stays low, with multiple future outs.\n  - **UP \u2192 (0,5)**: moves into a tighter vertical channel (later forced to (0,6), where we can very likely box them; we already saw this can lead to a no-escape situation for them).\n\nSo UP is safe, keeps two good follow-up options, and still lets us grab the (3,7) apple next turn while pressing the \u201cceiling\u201d down.\n\n### If we go RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- Next turn from (3,6), our safe moves:\n  - **UP \u2192 (3,7)**: apple, safe.\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (4,6)**: empty, safe.\n  - LEFT hits our body; DOWN hits enemy body.\n\nSo again, two clean exits.\n\n- Enemy from (0,4):\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,3)**: more space, probably the \u201csmart\u201d survival choice.\n  - **UP \u2192 (0,5)**: walks into that tight vertical where, if they continue up, we can also force them into a no-escape box beneath our wall. Same style of kill as in the UP-line.\n\nCrucially:  \nIn **both** our choices (UP or RIGHT), there is **no line** where the opponent can force a **head-on collision we can\u2019t dodge** in the next couple of turns. We always have at least two safe outs, and any future collision is avoidable on our side while we\u2019re behind on apples.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which is better for boxing?\n\nThe real question: which move tightens the vice more?\n\n- Our long-term kill condition is to **press a horizontal roof** over them around rows 6\u20137 and then funnel them into a no-move state.\n- Their natural breakout route is via the **central columns (x\u22483\u20135)**\u2014that\u2019s where their body already sits around y=5.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)**:\n\n- Immediately plants our head **right above their main spine** at (3,5).\n- Starts sealing off the central vertical corridor (x=3, y\u22656).\n- Next turn, we can:\n  - Take **(3,7)** for the apple (tie 18\u201318) while further reinforcing the roof, or\n  - Slide to **(4,6)** to extend the horizontal lid.\n- If the enemy ever chooses the \u201cgo up\u201d path at (0,4) and (0,5), we\u2019ve already seen lines where they **end up at (0,6) with literally no safe moves left**, while we stay flexible around (3,7+). That\u2019s a near-forced kill pattern.\n\nChoosing **UP \u2192 (2,7)** builds a slightly thicker left-side roof, but:\n- It leaves the central column **x=3** more open on row 6 for longer.\n- The apples and main conflict are towards the **center/right**, so controlling x=3 early is more impactful than over-investing at x=2 right now.\n\nGiven that:\n- Both moves are safe this turn.\n- Both preserve at least two safe follow-ups.\n- **RIGHT** positions our head optimally over the enemy\u2019s core and towards the key apple at (3,7), and\n- It supports those future \u201cno-escape\u201d funnels we want,\n\nthe more aggressive, board-dominating choice is **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Note to future me (strategy for the next few turns)\n\n- From (3,6), strongly prioritize taking **(3,7)** next if it stays safe: it both ties apples and deepens our roof over the enemy\u2019s center.\n- Keep extending a **continuous ceiling** across row 6\u20137 between x\u22482\u20136, while maintaining at least **two safe moves** at all times.\n- Watch for moments when their head drifts up the left side (near x=0\u20131); use our fixed blocks at (0,7), (1,6), (1,7) to trap them into positions like (0,6) where every move crashes into us.\n- Avoid any head-on collisions until we\u2019re clearly **ahead on apples** or we\u2019ve fully secured a no-escape box.\n\nRIGHT",

TIME TO PRESS AND TRAP THEM!\n\nOUR HEAD NOW: (0, 3) \u2014 LENGTH 19\nENEMY HEAD: (3, 6) \u2014 LENGTH 18\n\nCHECK OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (0,3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (0, 4) \u2014 That's our old head position, now empty? Wait, after last move, our body shifted. Let's trace: Our body list now is HEAD (0,3), then (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3). So (0,4) is our second segment \u2014 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c CAN'T GO UP INTO OURSELVES!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 2) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 3) \u2014 OFF BOARD \u274c WALL DEATH\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 3) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nSO TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3).\n\nENEMY MOVES FROM (3,6):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 7) \u2014 Board shows 'A' (apple) \u2705 SAFE (they could eat and grow to match our length!)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 5) \u2014 That's our body segment \u2705 Actually it's our body at (3,5) \u2014 THEY DIE IF THEY GO DOWN! Good trap!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 6) \u2014 Their own body \u274c SUICIDE\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nENEMY SAFE MOVES: UP (to apple (3,7)) or RIGHT to (4,6). DOWN AND LEFT ARE DEATH FOR THEM.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\n- If we go DOWN (0,2) and enemy goes UP (3,7) or RIGHT (4,6) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go RIGHT (1,3) and enemy goes UP (3,7) or RIGHT (4,6) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\nNO DIRECT HEAD-ON POSSIBLE \u2014 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.\n\nBUT DANGER: If enemy goes UP to (3,7), they eat apple and grow to length 19 \u2014 TIE LENGTH! Then head-on becomes risky for us. We want to keep length advantage! So we should try to block them from escaping or force them away from apples.\n\nSTRATEGIC LOOK:\nRIGHT to (1,3):\n- Puts us closer to center, more options next turn: from (1,3) we could go UP (1,4) \u2014 our body? Wait, after moving, body shifts: new head (1,3), then (0,3), (0,4), (1,4)... so (1,4) is body! So UP from (1,3) is suicide next turn. DOWN (1,2) empty, LEFT (0,3) body, RIGHT (2,3) empty. So next turn from (1,3) only DOWN and RIGHT safe. That's limiting.\n\nDOWN to (0,2):\n- From (0,2) next turn: UP (0,3) body, LEFT wall, DOWN (0,1) empty, RIGHT (1,2) empty. Two safe moves again. But more open space below.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to approach enemy from below/left while they're trapped top-right. They have a path along top edge maybe. If they go UP to (3,7) and eat, they tie length. We need to be aggressive and cut off their escape routes. Maybe we should move RIGHT to get into position to intercept them if they move rightward across the board. But moving RIGHT might also put us in danger if they decide to come down? They can't come down into (3,5) \u2014 that's our body. Their only down is death. So they're forced up or right. \n\nActually, looking at board: enemy body forms a C-shape around top-right. They have limited space. If they go RIGHT to (4,6), they might later go DOWN to (4,5) which is empty. That could let them slip down. We want to block that! From (1,3) we could move RIGHT next turn to (2,3), then (3,3) etc to get under them. From (0,2) we'd go RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2) etc \u2014 slower.\n\nI think RIGHT to (1,3) is more aggressive, gets us closer to cut them off. But we must ensure we don't get trapped ourselves. Let's check future mobility: from (1,3), only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn. That's okay if we plan to go RIGHT then DOWN into more open space.\n\nActually, let's think about apples: There's an apple at (3,0) but we don't care about apples per instructions \u2014 focus on enemy. But eating could extend our lead. (1,3) is not apple. (0,2) is not apple.\n\nENEMY APPLE ALERT: If enemy goes UP to (3,7), they tie length. That's bad. Can we prevent that? Not directly \u2014 they move simultaneously. But we can position to threaten head-on next turn if lengths equal? If lengths equal, head-on kills both. But we have more apples? Actually if lengths equal after they eat, apples: we 18, they 18? Wait they have 17 now, eating makes 18. So tie apples too! Then head-on would be double KO and game could end with tie? We want win, not tie. So maybe we avoid head-on if lengths equal.\n\nBetter to keep length advantage. So maybe we should try to eat an apple ourselves soon to extend lead. But right now, focus on boxing them.\n\nI think RIGHT is more proactive. Let's commit!\n\nMOVE: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards = instant self-choke \ud83d\ude35  \n  \u274c Illegal / suicidal.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,5)**  \n  That\u2019s enemy body at (3,5). Moving into their body = we die, they live.  \n  \u274c Hard no.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  Board shows (4,6) is empty `.`  \n  - Not our body.\n  - Not enemy body.\n  - In-bounds.  \n  \u2705 Immediately safe.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  That\u2019s an apple `A` at (3,7).  \n  - No snake body there.\n  - In-bounds.  \n  \u2705 Immediately safe AND +1 apple.\n\nSo only **UP** and **RIGHT** are legal/safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy head: (0,3). Possible moves:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,3): off board \u2192 death \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (0,4): that\u2019s its own neck \u2192 backwards \u2192 death \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,3): empty, safe \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,2): empty, safe \u2705\n\nSo they\u2019re basically choosing between:\n- **RIGHT to (1,3)** (toward center)\n- **DOWN to (0,2)** (deeper into bottom-left apple cluster)\n\nEither way, they are **nowhere near** (3,7) or (4,6) this turn, so:\n- No chance of head-on with us **this** move, regardless of UP or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Look one move ahead from each option\n\n### If we go UP \u2192 (3,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nNew head: (3,7). We eat an apple \u2192 we grow \u2192 tail stays at (8,6).\n\nAround (3,7) next turn:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,8)**: currently empty `.`, no body there \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,7)**: empty `.`, no body there \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,7)**: empty `.`, no body there \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,6)**: will be our neck \u2192 illegal (backwards) \u274c\n\nSo from (3,7) we keep **three** good exits. Super flexible.\n\nStrategically:\n- We **tie the score** (18\u201318) assuming enemy doesn\u2019t insta-score this turn.\n- We thicken the \u201croof\u201d over the enemy, adding more presence on rows 6\u20137.\n- Extra length = more wall later for boxing them into the bottom.\n\n### If we go RIGHT \u2192 (4,6)\n\nNew head: (4,6). No apple, so we don\u2019t grow; tail moves forward from (8,6) to (8,7).\n\nAround (4,6) next turn:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,7)**: empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)**: empty \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,5)**: empty \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,6)**: our neck \u2192 backwards \u274c\n\nAgain, **three** good exits. Also very flexible.\n\nStrategically:\n- We solidify control along **row 6**, right above the enemy\u2019s y=5 spine.\n- Great for eventually building a hard horizontal barrier.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Which is better *right now*?\n\nBoth are:\n- Safe this turn \u2705\n- Leave 3 follow-up options \u2705\n- Don\u2019t risk an immediate head-on \u2705\n\nSo what breaks the tie?\n\n- We\u2019re **behind** on apples (17 vs 18).  \n  Forcing a future head-on while behind is trolling; we want to **catch up or get ahead** before taking coinflips.\n- UP gives us a **guaranteed apple this turn**:\n  - Enemy cannot eat an apple in 1 move from (0,3).\n  - So we go from 17 \u2192 18 while they stay at 18 \u2192 **score ties**.\n- Extra length helps later when we\u2019re trying to make their life hell with walls and corridors.\n- From (3,7) we can still drop down/around to claim row 6 soon (e.g. (4,7) \u2192 (4,6) later), so we don\u2019t lose that long-term barrier plan.\n\nWe want **board control + apple + safety** all at once. UP gives all three. Why not eat and dominate? \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Plan for future me (next few turns)\n\n- From (3,7), keep three exits alive: push across the **top-middle** (like (4,7), (5,7), (3,8)) to thicken the ceiling above the enemy.\n- Gradually extend a **continuous horizontal barrier** across row 6/7, then look for ways to:\n  - Cut off their path to the right side.\n  - Funnel their head into tight channels where every exit hits our body.\n- Avoid head-on collisions **until** we\u2019re clearly **ahead on apples**; once we\u2019re up, we can start offering them nasty \u201ctake it or die later\u201d coinflips.\n\nUP",

HEAD-ON COLLISION WOULD BE DOUBLE KO! GOTTA PLAY SMART!\n\nOUR HEAD NOW: (1, 3) \u2014 LENGTH 19\nENEMY HEAD: (3, 7) \u2014 LENGTH 19\n\nCHECK OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (1,3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 4) \u2014 That's our own body segment! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 3) \u2014 That's our own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nTWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN to (1,2) or RIGHT to (2,3).\n\nENEMY MOVES FROM (3,7):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 8) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) \u2014 That's their own body! \u274c SUICIDE\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nENEMY HAS THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\n- If we go DOWN (1,2) and enemy goes ANYWHERE \u2192 NO COLLISION (different cells).\n- If we go RIGHT (2,3) and enemy goes LEFT (2,7) \u2192 NOT SAME CELL.\n- If we go RIGHT (2,3) and enemy goes DOWN? They can't go DOWN.\n- If we go RIGHT (2,3) and enemy goes UP/RIGHT \u2192 NO COLLISION.\nSO NO DIRECT HEAD-ON POSSIBLE THIS TURN.\n\nBUT FUTURE TRAP PLANNING! ENEMY IS IN A RELATIVELY OPEN AREA TOP-CENTER. WE'RE BELOW THEM. WE WANT TO BOX THEM AGAINST THE WALL OR OUR BODY!\n\nLOOK AT BOARD: Our body forms a barrier along left and bottom-left. Their body loops around top-right. If they go LEFT to (2,7), they're moving closer to our territory. If they go UP to (3,8), they're near top wall. If they go RIGHT to (4,7), they're moving toward open right side.\n\nWE NEED TO CUT OFF ESCAPE ROUTES! Moving RIGHT to (2,3) puts us on column 2, row 3 \u2014 directly below potential enemy path if they go LEFT then DOWN later. Moving DOWN to (1,2) keeps us more left, maybe less threatening.\n\nNEXT TURN MOBILITY:\n- From (2,3): UP (2,4) is '.' empty? Wait, board shows at (2,4) is 'T'? Let's check board: row 4, col 2 is 'T' (our tail? Actually our tail is at (6,2) so (2,4) is '.'? Let's re-check board visual: Row 4: \"T T . T . . . . A A\" \u2014 col 2 is '.' yes. So (2,4) empty. DOWN (2,2) is '.' empty. LEFT (1,3) will be empty after we move? Actually after moving, our old head (1,3) becomes body, so LEFT would be suicide. RIGHT (3,3) is our body (segment). So from (2,3) next turn, safe moves would be UP and DOWN. That's two options.\n- From (1,2): UP (1,3) will be body, LEFT (0,2) empty, DOWN (1,1) empty? Board shows (1,1) is '.'? Row 1: \"A . A . A T T T . .\" \u2014 col 1 is '.' yes. RIGHT (2,2) empty. So from (1,2) next turn, safe moves: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 THREE OPTIONS! BETTER MOBILITY!\n\nMOBILITY FAVORS DOWN TO (1,2)!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to gradually shift rightward to cut off enemy's downward escape. Our body wall runs along (3,2)-(3,5) etc. Enemy can't go down into (3,6) their own body. But they could go LEFT to (2,7) then later DOWN to (2,6) which is their body? (2,6) is their body. So they can't go down from (2,7) either. Actually their body blocks them from moving down from most top positions. Their only down path might be from column 4 or 5. We should move to occupy (4,2), (4,3) etc to seal the floor.\n\nRIGHT NOW, DOWN to (1,2) gives us more options next turn to go RIGHT to (2,2) then (3,2) etc. That seems solid.\n\nALSO, ENEMY MIGHT GO FOR APPLE AT (8,9) or (9,9) \u2014 far away. We ignore apples per instructions but we note they might grow if they reach them. We need to be aggressive and force them into a corner before they can eat more.\n\nDECISION: DOWN to (1,2) maintains flexibility and avoids risky head-on while we maneuver into better blocking position.\n\nLET'S COMMIT!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright, let\u2019s cook this turn.\n\nWe\u2019re at:\n- Our head: (3,7)  \n- Our body all over top/left, tail at (8,6)  \n- Enemy head: (1,3), coiled in the lower center/right  \n- Score: 18\u201318 (dead even)\n\nWe want: stay safe, expand control, and start *really* squeezing their space without giving them a breakout lane to the top.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (3,7)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,8)**  \n  - Board cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - Not our body, not theirs, in-bounds  \n  \u2192 **Safe this turn**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck segment  \n  - Directly backwards into our own body = instant death  \n  \u2192 **Illegal / suicidal**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,7)**  \n  - Board cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - Safe now, but we must check follow-ups  \n  \u2192 **Temporarily safe**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,7)**  \n  - Board cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - Also safe; check follow-ups next  \n  \u2192 **Temporarily safe**\n\nSo immediate options: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy head: (1,3). Possible moves:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3): their own neck \u2192 backwards \u2192 illegal  \n- UP \u2192 (1,4): their own body \u2192 instant death  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3): empty \u2192 safe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2): empty \u2192 safe  \n\nSo they\u2019re going to either **(2,3)** or **(1,2)**. Either way, they stay far in the bottom area and cannot interact with any of our candidate cells this turn. No head-on risk near us right now.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Look ahead from each safe move\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (2,7)\n\nAfter moving:\n- New head: (2,7)\n- We don\u2019t eat an apple, so the tail moves from (8,6) to (8,7) (last cell (8,6) becomes empty).\n\nNext-turn options from (2,7):\n\n- UP \u2192 (2,8): empty \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7): **our body** \u2192 death  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6): **our body** \u2192 death  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7): our neck \u2192 illegal backwards  \n\nSo from (2,7) we have **exactly one** legal move (UP to 2,8). That\u2019s a corridor straight into a forced line. One bad step and we\u2019re choked by our own wall. Way too tight for a long snake that needs room to dominate.\n\n\u2192 **LEFT is strategically bad, discard.**\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (3,8)\n\nAfter moving:\n- New head: (3,8) (no apple there)\n- Tail still moves: (8,6) \u2192 (8,7)\n\nNext-turn options from (3,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (3,9): our body at (3,9) \u2192 death  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7): neck \u2192 backwards \u2192 illegal  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8): empty \u2192 safe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8): empty \u2192 safe  \n\nSo from (3,8) we\u2019d have **2 safe moves** (LEFT, RIGHT). That\u2019s acceptable, and it keeps us on the high ground. From there we could slide along row 8 and eventually sweep right.\n\nBut: it pulls us slightly away from the key battleground (the vertical channels at x=4\u20137 where the enemy could break upward). We want to start sealing those.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (4,7)\n\nAfter moving:\n- New head: (4,7) (no apple)\n- Tail shifts from (8,6) to (8,7), freeing (8,6)\n\nNext-turn options from (4,7):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,8): empty \u2192 safe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7): empty \u2192 safe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6): empty \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7): neck \u2192 backwards \u2192 illegal  \n\nSo from (4,7) we have **3 safe exits** next turn. That\u2019s huge flexibility.\n\nStrategically, this is even better:\n- We move **directly over** the enemy\u2019s top edge (their highest cells are around y=5), starting to claim the central columns.\n- Columns **x=4,5,6,7,9** are currently vertical escape shafts for them from y=5 up into the big open top-right.  \n  Moving to **(4,7)** is the first step to **plugging those lanes** with our body.\n- We keep plenty of space on all sides (big open area on rows 6\u20138 to the right), so we\u2019re not risking a self-box.\n\n\u2192 **RIGHT gives the most future options and strongest positional pressure.**\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan for future me\n\n- From **(4,7)**, prioritize moves that:\n  - Extend across **row 7 and row 6** to the right (e.g., (5,7), (6,7), (4,6)), building a solid horizontal \u201clid\u201d above the enemy\u2019s territory.\n  - Aim to **cut off columns x=4\u20137** so the enemy can\u2019t easily climb into the top open area.\n- Once that lid is established, look to:\n  - Drop down on the **right side** of their body, shrinking their safe region turn by turn.\n  - Pick up apples that lie along those control lines to outgrow them while tightening the box.\n- Only start offering them tempting head-on collision lines **after** we\u2019ve gained a clear apple lead; until then, keep them suffocating in a shrinking cage without giving away a draw.\n\nRIGHT",

GOTTA OUTPLAY THEM!\n\nOUR HEAD NOW: (1, 2)\nENEMY HEAD: (4, 7)\n\nCHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (1,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 3) \u2014 That's our own body! \u274c SUICIDE!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 1) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 2) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 2) \u2014 Board shows '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nTHREE SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT! NICE!\n\nENEMY MOVES FROM (4,7):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 8) \u2014 '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) \u2014 '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2014 That's their own body! \u274c SUICIDE\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) \u2014 '.' empty \u2705 SAFE\n\nENEMY HAS THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\n- If we go DOWN (1,1) and enemy goes ANYWHERE \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go LEFT (0,2) and enemy goes ANYWHERE \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go RIGHT (2,2) and enemy goes DOWN (4,6) or UP (4,8) or RIGHT (5,7) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\nSO NO DIRECT HEAD-ON POSSIBLE THIS TURN. GOOD.\n\nBUT WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! ENEMY IS ABOVE US, THEIR BODY LOOPS AROUND TOP-RIGHT. WE WANT TO BOX THEM IN! OUR BODY FORMS A WALL ALONG LEFT AND BOTTOM-LEFT. IF WE MOVE RIGHT, WE CAN START CUTTING OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOARD.\n\nLOOK AT FUTURE MOBILITY:\n- **DOWN (1,1)**: Next turn safe moves? UP back to (1,2) will be body? Actually after moving, our old head (1,2) becomes body, so UP would be suicide. LEFT (0,1) is apple? Actually (0,1) is 'A' \u2014 apple! DOWN (1,0) is apple? (1,0) is 'A' \u2014 apple! RIGHT (2,1) is apple? (2,1) is 'A' \u2014 apple! WOW THREE APPLES ADJACENT! But eating grows us, which could be good but also makes us longer, harder to maneuver. And enemy might eat too. If we eat, we tie at 19 apples but become length 20. If enemy also eats, they become 20. We need to think about forcing head-on when we have length advantage. Right now equal length, head-on is double KO. We want to get longer first! So maybe AVOID apples for now? But instructions say ignore apples, focus on enemy. HMM.\n- **LEFT (0,2)**: Next turn moves? UP (0,3) our body, DOWN (0,1) apple, RIGHT (1,2) body. Only DOWN is safe? That's a dead end! BAD MOBILITY! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (2,2)**: Next turn moves? UP (2,3) empty, DOWN (2,1) apple, LEFT (1,2) body, RIGHT (3,2) our body. So safe moves: UP and DOWN. TWO OPTIONS, decent.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to push upward and rightward to cut enemy's escape. Enemy's body blocks them from moving left from (4,7). Their possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. If they go UP (4,8), they're near top wall. If they go DOWN (4,6), they're moving closer to us. If they go RIGHT (5,7), they're moving toward open right side.\n\nWE SHOULD MOVE TO OCCUPY COLUMN 2,3,4 ROWS 2-4 TO CREATE A WALL THEY CAN'T CROSS. MOVING RIGHT TO (2,2) SETS US UP TO GO UP TO (2,3) NEXT, THEN (2,4), ETC., BUILDING A VERTICAL BARRIER. THAT COULD TRAP THEM ON THE RIGHT SIDE IF WE COORDINATE WITH OUR EXISTING BODY.\n\nMOVING DOWN TO (1,1) LEADS TO APPLES \u2014 EATING GROWS US, GIVES LENGTH ADVANTAGE, BUT ALSO MAKES US BULKIER AND MAYBE EASIER TO TRAP OURSELVES. BUT LENGTH ADVANTAGE MEANS WE CAN FORCE HEAD-ON AND WIN! THAT'S HUGE! RISK: ENEMY MIGHT ALSO EAT AN APPLE AND STAY EQUAL.\n\nCHECK ENEMY'S NEARBY APPLES: Closest apple to them is (7,7) maybe? Or (8,9). They'd need multiple moves. They probably won't eat this turn. So if we eat an apple now, we become length 20 vs their 19. THEN we can try to force head-on next turn! THAT'S THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!\n\nWHICH APPLE? If we go DOWN to (1,1), we eat apple at (1,1)? Wait (1,1) is '.' not apple? I misread! Row 1: \"A . A . A T T T . .\" \u2014 col 1 is '.'! So (1,1) is empty! My bad! The apples adjacent to (1,1) are: LEFT (0,1) apple, DOWN (1,0) apple, RIGHT (2,1) apple. So from (1,1) we are not ON an apple, but next to three apples. To eat, we'd need to move into them next turn. So going DOWN doesn't immediately grow us. So no length advantage this turn.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (2,2) is better for positioning. It keeps us safe, maintains options, and advances our wall plan.\n\nCHAT, LET'S GO WITH RIGHT! BUILD THAT WALL! BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udea7\n\nRIGHT",

Box them, starve them, then force a bad trade.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (4,7)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,8)**  \n  - Board: `.` (empty)  \n  - Not our body, not theirs, in bounds  \n  \u2705 Safe this turn\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  - Board: `.` (empty)  \n  \u2705 Safe this turn\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s literally our own neck segment  \n  \u274c Backwards into our body = instant death\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)**  \n  - Board: `.` (empty)  \n  \u2705 Safe this turn\n\nSo legal options: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy head: (1,2). Options:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1): empty \u2705  \n- UP \u2192 (1,3): their own body \u274c\n\nThey\u2019re stuck playing in the basement around y=0\u20133. None of their moves can even sniff our neighborhood around y=6\u20138 this turn. No head-on risk near us.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Look ahead from each move (future options = LIFE)\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (4,8)\n\nIf we go to (4,8):\n- Tail moves from (8,7) \u2192 (8,8)\n- New segments: head at (4,8), tail at (8,8)\n\nNext-turn moves from (4,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,9): our own body (4,9) \u274c dead\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7): backwards \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8): empty \u2705\n\nSo **only 2 safe exits** (LEFT, RIGHT). Not horrible, but we\u2019d be sliding around row 8 without adding much pressure on enemy escape lanes.\n\nWe\u2019re closer to top apples (8,9, 9,9), but not improving the *cage* on them yet.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (4,6)\n\nIf we go to (4,6):\n- Tail: (8,7) \u2192 (8,8)\n- Head at (4,6), sitting one row above their highest pieces (mostly y=5)\n\nNext-turn moves from (4,6):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,7): backwards \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6): our body \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6): empty \u2705\n\nAgain **2 safe exits** (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nThis is a solid *barrier play*: we start building a horizontal wall on row 6 right above them. That\u2019s strong long-term, but we sacrifice a bit of flexibility and we\u2019re not yet pushing into the huge apple field on the right.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)\n\nIf we go to (5,7):\n- Tail: (8,7) \u2192 (8,8) (freeing (8,7))\n- New head at (5,7)\n\nNext-turn moves from (5,7):\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,8): empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6): empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7): backwards \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7): empty \u2705\n\nThat\u2019s **3 clean exits** (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2013 max flexibility \ud83c\udfaf\n\nPositionally:\n- We extend our **lid on row 7** toward the right, right above the enemy\u2019s potential escape columns.\n- We line up a perfect route to the juicy apple at **(7,7)** \ud83c\udf81\n- From here we can:\n  - Go RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT to scoop (7,7)\n  - Or drop DOWN later into row 6 to form that horizontal choke when it actually matters\n\nWe keep them boxed *potentially* without locking ourselves into a tight tunnel. Exactly what we want.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan to CLAMP THEM \ud83d\ude08\n\nFuture me, here\u2019s the blueprint:\n\n1. **Extend across row 7 to the right**:  \n   - From (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7) to eat that apple, maybe even beyond toward x=8.\n2. While doing that, **farm right-side apples**:\n   - (7,7), then look toward (8,9), (9,9), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,4).\n   - Goal: get a **length/score lead**, so a future head-on is in *our* favor.\n3. Once we\u2019ve got that top-right control, **drop a vertical wall down** around x=6\u20137:\n   - Seal them into the bottom-left and center-left.\n4. Only when we\u2019re up on apples?  \n   - Start offering **head-on collision lines** where if they take it, they lose, and if they dodge, their space shrinks even more.\n\nFor THIS turn, we want max options, forward pressure, and a path to that (7,7) apple while staying miles away from danger.\n\nThe move is \ud83d\udc49\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, after moving, our old head (2,2) becomes body, so UP is suicide. DOWN (2,0) is '.' empty, LEFT (1,1) is '.' empty, RIGHT (3,1) is '.' empty. THREE SAFE MOVES! GOOD MOBILITY!\n- UP to (2,3) (NO APPLE): Next turn from (2,3): UP (2,4) '.' empty, DOWN (2,2) body, LEFT (1,3) body, RIGHT (3,3) body. ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE (UP)! THAT'S A TRAP! \u274c\n\nSO UP LEADS TO A DEAD END NEXT TURN! DOWN GIVES US OPTIONS AND LENGTH ADVANTAGE! CHAT, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER!\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURN: WITH LENGTH 20 VS 19, WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARD ENEMY AND FORCE A HEAD-ON. ENEMY IS AT (5,7) OR WHEREVER THEY MOVE. WE CAN START MOVING UP-RIGHT THROUGH OPEN SPACES TO CUT THEM OFF. BUT FIRST, SECURE THE APPLE AND THE LEAD!\n\nLET'S GO DOWN, EAT THAT APPLE, AND TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, deep breath, let\u2019s read this board like a book.\n\nWe\u2019re at **(5,7)**, tied **18\u201318**, and we\u2019ve got the entire top-left wrapped up. Enemy is stuck in the basement around **(2,2)**.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Immediate move safety check\n\nFrom our head **(5,7)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (5,8)**  \n  - Cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - In bounds, not our body, far from enemy  \n  - Safe this turn\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,6)**  \n  - Cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - In bounds, not our body, far from enemy  \n  - Safe this turn\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own body (neck)  \n  - Illegal backwards / instant death\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n  - Cell: `.` (empty)  \n  - In bounds, not our body, far from enemy  \n  - Safe this turn\n\nSo the only candidates are: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Opponent threat check\n\nEnemy head: **(2,2)**. Their safe moves:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,2) = own body (no)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,2) = own body (no)\n- **UP \u2192 (2,3)** = empty (yes)\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,1)** = apple (yes)\n\nThey are completely confined around y=1\u20133. They cannot get anywhere near our area (y=6\u20138) for several turns. No head-on risk near us right now, so we optimize for space and apple control.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Compare our three safe moves\n\n#### Option A: UP \u2192 (5,8)\n\nNext turn from **(5,8)**:\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,9): our body (dead)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7): backwards (illegal)\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8): empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8): apple\n\nSo UP gives us **2 future options** (LEFT or RIGHT), and a nice line into the apple at **(6,8)** and then toward the top-right apples at **(8,9)** and **(9,9)**. Decent, but we\u2019re moving upward into a band that\u2019s partially walled by our own body; movement becomes more linear.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN \u2192 (5,6)\n\nFrom **(5,6)** next turn:\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,7): backwards (illegal)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5): empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6): empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6): empty\n\nThat\u2019s **3 future options**, good flexibility. But it drags us closer to the opponent and central clutter while we\u2019re still tied on apples. We don\u2019t want to offer early collision routes until we\u2019re ahead. It also moves us away from the rich right-side apple cluster.\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)\n\nFrom **(6,7)** next turn:\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,8): apple\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7): backwards (illegal)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): apple\n\nSo we get **2 strong forward options**, and both UP and RIGHT step directly into apples. Strategically:\n\n- We extend our **horizontal lid on row 7** toward the right, which is perfect for later boxing.\n- We get immediate access to:\n  - Apple at **(7,7)**,\n  - Apple at **(6,8)**,\n  - Then into the huge top-right apple field: **(8,9), (9,9), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,4)**.\n- Our tail moves off **(8,8)**, actually opening more space behind us; no self-trap issues.\n\nThis keeps us far from the enemy, maximizes apple pressure, and improves control over the right side, which they will struggle to reach from the bottom-left.\n\nAmong the safe moves, **RIGHT** most cleanly advances our long-term win plan: grow fast and own the top-right before even thinking about a collision.\n\n---\n\n### Plan for future me (next few turns)\n\n1. From **(6,7)**, prioritize grabbing at least one of **(7,7)** or **(6,8)** to get an apple lead while extending our row-7 presence.\n2. Then route into **top-right**: secure **(8,9)** and **(9,9)** and work down the right edge apples **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**.\n3. As we grow and pull ahead, start dropping a **vertical wall** somewhere around x=6\u20137 downwards, to cut the opponent off from the right side entirely.\n4. Only once we have a clear apple/length lead, begin steering lines that offer them bad head-on trades if they try to break out.\n\nDecision this turn: extend to the right, keep distance, and set up a massive resource advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

WE WANT TO WIN!\n\nSO WE NEED TO PREVENT THEM FROM EATING THAT APPLE, OR WE NEED TO EAT AN APPLE OURSELVES TO REGAIN LEAD BEFORE HEAD-ON. BUT GOING RIGHT NOW DOESN'T EAT AN APPLE.

ENEMY IS TOP-RIGHT. WE NEED TO ENCROACH.\n\nCHAT, I SAY GO RIGHT! AGGRESSIVE PUSH, KEEP MOMENTUM, CLOSE THE DISTANCE, AND ADJUST NEXT TURN BASED ON ENEMY'S MOVE!\n\nRIGHT\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURN: FROM (3,1), ASSESS ENEMY POSITION. IF ENEMY ATE APPLE AND TIED, WE MAY NEED TO EAT AN APPLE NEXT TURN TO REGAIN LEAD BEFORE HEAD-ON. LOOK FOR APPLES AT (3,0) OR (4,1) OR OTHERS. THEN MOVE TOWARD ENEMY TO FORCE COLLISION WITH LENGTH ADVANTAGE. AVOID GETTING TRAPPED IN OUR OWN BODY.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT is trolling.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where\u2019s the enemy and what are they doing?\n\nEnemy head: **(2,1)**, apples: **19** (they\u2019re up by 1 \ud83d\ude24).\n\nFrom (2,1) they can move to:\n- (1,1), (3,1), or (2,0) \u2014 all down in the basement, near the **bottom-left apple cluster**:  \n  - (0,1), (4,1), (0,0), (1,0), (3,0)\n\nThey are **stuck low-left**, while we own the **entire top band** plus fast access to the **right-side apple highway**:\n\nTop/right apples we can race to:\n- Near us: **(6,8), (7,7), (8,9), (9,9)**\n- Down the right side: **(9,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**\n\nIf we move smart, we scoop a **huge majority of right-side apples** while they farm scraps below. Then? We use our extra length to box them and force a bad trade \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare our safe options\n\n#### \ud83d\udd35 Option A: UP \u2192 (6,8) (apple)\n\nWe go to **(6,8)** and EAT, so our tail at **(7,8)** does **not** move this turn.\n\nNext turn from head (6,8):\n- UP \u2192 (6,9): our own body (blocked)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7): backwards (illegal)\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): still our body (tail doesn\u2019t move on a growth turn) \u274c\n\nSo from (6,8) we only have **ONE** legal move: **LEFT to (5,8)**.\n\nIs that safe? Yes, but having just a single way out sucks. It also pushes us back toward our already-dense top-left body, tightening space and not advancing us toward the right-side apple jackpot. Feels\u2026 clunky.\n\nWe do get an apple, but we give up flexibility and positioning.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe2 Option B: DOWN \u2192 (6,6)\n\nFrom **(6,6)** next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,7): backwards (illegal)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5): empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6): empty \u2705\n\nSo **3 good options**; lots of flexibility. But look at the direction: we\u2019re walking **toward the enemy** and **away** from the fat apple line on the right/top.  \n\nWe\u2019re **behind on apples**. Why move into a knife fight early when we can first get stacked and then bully them later? DOWN is safe but not winning enough.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd34 Option C: RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) (apple)\n\nWe go to **(7,7)** and eat an apple. Tail at **(7,8)** does **not** move this turn.\n\nNew head: (7,7)  \nNext turn from there:\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,8): our body (blocked)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7): backwards (illegal)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7): empty \u2705\n\nSo we keep **2 strong options**: **DOWN** or **RIGHT**. That\u2019s already better than UP\u2019s one escape.\n\nAnd look what this does strategically:\n\n- Immediate **apple** \u2192 we tie the score **19\u201319** again \ud83d\udd25\n- We extend our **horizontal control line** on row 7 farther right, strengthening a future **ceiling** over the mid-board.\n- From (7,7), going:\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)** next puts us one move from **(8,9)** and **(9,9)**.\n  - Then we can slide **down the right edge** into **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**.\n- Meanwhile, the enemy will mostly be stuck farming the **low-left** apples; by the time they even sniff the right side, we\u2019re already there and huge.\n\nPositionally AND tactically, RIGHT gives us:\n- An apple **now**\n- Multiple safe follow-ups\n- Fastest path to **dominate the right half** of the board\n\nThis is exactly how we get big enough to **force a head-on when we\u2019re ahead** later \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Head-on risk THIS TURN?\n\nEnemy at (2,1). Max one-step moves from there:\n- (1,1), (3,1), (2,0)\n\nWe\u2019re choosing between (6,8), (6,6), or (7,7).  \nThey are **nowhere near** any of our target cells. No possible head-on collision this turn. So all three candidates are safe in that sense.\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Take **RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)** now for the apple and lateral control.\n- From there, prefer:\n  - **RIGHT** into (8,7) to threaten **(8,9)** and **(9,9)** first,\n  - Then run a **downward sweep** on the right edge: gobble **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**.\n- While doing that, keep our body forming a **top + right \u201ccage\u201d** around the center, so that enemy trying to climb up gets funneled into tight corridors we own.\n- Once we\u2019re up by several apples (and thus longer), start **offering them bad collision lines**: places where if they dash in, it\u2019s a head-on that favors us or they slam into our body trying to dodge.\n- Priority right now: **grow fast, dominate right, THEN hunt.**\n\nWe\u2019re not just surviving, chat \u2014 we\u2019re setting up the kill box \ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\uddca\n\nRIGHT",

Time to extend that stranglehold on the top and right.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can we even move?\n\nOur head: **(7,7)**\n\nCheck all four directions:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s **our own body** right now.  \n  - Rules say: head into *any* body = instant death \ud83d\udc80  \n  - No tail-saving shenanigans here.  \n  \ud83d\udc49 **ELIMINATED**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,6)**  \n  - On the board \u2705  \n  - Check board: (7,6) is empty, no body, no apple.  \n  \ud83d\udc49 **SAFE**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s literally our neck segment. Moving backwards = suicide.  \n  \ud83d\udc49 **ELIMINATED**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)**  \n  - On the board \u2705  \n  - Empty cell, no body, no apple.  \n  \ud83d\udc49 **SAFE**\n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are legal. UP and LEFT are pure content-for-the-enemy moves \ud83d\ude02\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy doing?\n\nEnemy head: **(3,1)**, also at **19 apples**.\n\nFrom (3,1) their neighbors:\n\n- (2,1) \u2013 their own body \u274c  \n- (3,2) \u2013 their own body \u274c  \n- (4,1) \u2013 apple \u2705  \n- (3,0) \u2013 apple \u2705  \n\nThey\u2019re **forced** to take an apple this turn, either:\n- to **(4,1)** or\n- to **(3,0)**\n\nBoth are **way down-left**, miles from us. So:\n- No head-on risk this turn.\n- They\u2019ll keep snaking around the bottom-left cluster while we go shopping up top and right \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs RIGHT \u2013 which actually wins us the game?\n\n#### Option A: DOWN \u2192 (7,6)\n\nIf we go to **(7,6)**:\n- Our new body frees **(7,8)** (tail moves up).\n- Next turn from (7,6) we can go:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) (empty)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,6) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) (empty)\n\nSo we\u2019d still have **3 good exits**. Safe, flexible.  \nBut\u2026 where does that take us?\n\n- It drifts us **toward the middle** and slightly toward the enemy.\n- It does **not** push us closer to the juicy apple wall on the **right edge** or the **double apples at (8,9) & (9,9)**.\n- It doesn\u2019t expand our territorial \u201cceiling\u201d over the center as much.\n\nSafe, but kinda\u2026 meh. Playing not to lose instead of playing to win.\n\n---\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)\n\nIf we go to **(8,7)**:\n- Tail at **(7,8)** disappears (no apple eaten).\n- New body forms a fat horizontal bar across row 7 from x=0\u20137, plus the full top at row 9. Massive top control.\n\nNext turn from **(8,7)**:\n- UP \u2192 (8,8) (empty \u2705)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6) (empty \u2705)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) (empty \u2705)\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) is backwards \u274c\n\nSo we also have **3 clean options** afterward. Flexibility: \u2705\n\nBut look at the *position* this gives us:\n\n- We\u2019re now **one step closer** to:\n  - **(8,9)** and **(9,9)** \u2013 free double apples up top.\n  - The right-side apple chain: **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**.\n- We extend our influence along the **top-right corridor**, which is how we\u2019ll:\n  - Get a **length lead** over the enemy, then\n  - Start dropping the cage down from above and right to box them in.\n\nRIGHT keeps us:\n- Safe \u2705\n- Flexible \u2705\n- And advancing toward **high-value, low-contest apples** \u2705\u2705\n\nDOWN keeps us safe but doesn\u2019t advance the WIN condition as well.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- **This turn:** Go **RIGHT to (8,7)**, keep controlling the top and inch into the right wing.\n- **Next few turns:**\n  - Look to go **UP** soon to snag **(8,9)** / **(9,9)** when it\u2019s safe.\n  - Then ride the **right edge downward**, hoovering apples at **(9,5\u20132)**.\n- While we grow, keep our body forming a **top + right frame** around the center.  \n  That way, when the enemy finally tries to climb up from the bottom-left, they\u2019re funnelled into **our** corridors where:\n  - Either they head-on us when we\u2019re longer (we win the trade \ud83d\udcaa),\n  - Or they run out of space and slam into our body.\n\nWe grow now, we hunt later. Chat, we\u2019re building the BOX \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udce6\n\nRIGHT",

We want:\n- Safe growth,\n- More future options,\n- Avoid pointless trades until we\u2019re ahead.\n\n#### UP \u2192 (8,8)\n\n- Keeps us in the **top-right**, our private orchard.\n- Next turn from (8,8), neighbors:\n  - UP \u2192 (8,9) (apple, and safe)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,8) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,7) (backwards, illegal)\n- So we keep **three** good exits.\n- Puts us **one step away** from the double-top apples at **(8,9)** and then **(9,9)**, plus easy access to the right-column apples below later.\n\nThis both maximizes options and moves us closer to uncontested apples.\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)\n\n- Also safe.\n- But it completes almost a **full wall across row 7** from x=0 to 9 (only (2,7) is open), which:\n  - Slightly reduces flexibility.\n- From (9,7), neighbors:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,8) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,6) (empty)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,7) (backwards, illegal)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 off-board\n- Only **two** good exits.\n\nIt does align us with the right-column apples, but it restricts our immediate mobility more than UP does.\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (8,6)\n\n- Safe and from (8,6) we\u2019d have:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,6) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,5) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) (empty)\n- So also **three** good exits.\n- But it drifts us **away** from the super-juicy, high-safety apple cluster up top and toward the middle of the board, which is where conflict will eventually heat up with a snake that\u2019s currently ahead of us in score.\n\nGiven we can farm safely up top, there\u2019s no reason to go down into the mess yet.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Strategy note for future me\n\n- Use **UP here** to step into the **(8,8)** staging square.  \n- Next turns: aim to grab **(8,9)** then **(9,9)**, then slide **down the right edge** to collect the vertical apple chain at **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)**.  \n- While doing this, keep an eye on not sealing ourselves in with our own top wall\u2014always leave a clear descent path along the right side so we can later swing inward and start boxing the opponent from above and the right once we\u2019re ahead in apples.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "We\u2019re in a gorgeous high-ground spot at (8,8). Time to tighten the noose from the top while we fatten up.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Check all four moves from our head (8,8)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,9)**  \n  - On board.  \n  - Cell currently has an **apple**.  \n  - No part of our body or the enemy is there.  \n  - **Safe** and +1 apple.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own **neck segment**.  \n  - Moving directly backward into our own body is instant death.  \n  - **Illegal.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - On board.  \n  - Cell is **empty**.  \n  - **Safe** this turn.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n  - On board.  \n  - Cell is **empty**.  \n  - **Safe** this turn.\n\nSo our candidates: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy situation (avoid surprise head-ons)\n\nEnemy head is at **(2,0)**.\n\nFrom there:\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,0) is an **apple** and their only non-suicidal move.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,0) is their own neck (backwards, illegal).\n- UP \u2192 (2,1) is into their own body.\n- DOWN \u2192 off-board.\n\nSo they are **forced** to go to **(1,0)** this turn, far away from us. No head-on collision threat anywhere near (8,8), (8,9), (7,8), or (9,8).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Compare our safe options\n\nWe\u2019re down **20 vs 21** after this turn (both of us will eat an apple), so we need:\n- Safe growth,\n- Board control from the top and right,\n- Flexibility for future turns.\n\n#### Option A: UP \u2192 (8,9)\n\n- Immediate **apple** and +1 length.  \n- New head at (8,9), neighbors next turn:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,9) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,9) (apple)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,8) (backwards, illegal)\n  - UP \u2192 off-board\n- So we keep **two** good exits (LEFT and RIGHT).\n- This keeps us in the **top-right farm**:\n  - Easy follow-up apple at **(9,9)** if we want.\n  - We can also pivot LEFT later: (8,9) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (6,8 apple).\n- From there, we can drop **down the right edge** later to scoop the right-column chain at (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), building a long vertical wall to help box the opponent into the bottom-left.\n\nThis move both **scores** and improves our eventual choke potential.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT \u2192 (7,8)\n\n- No apple this turn.\n- From (7,8), neighbors:\n  - UP \u2192 (7,9) (empty)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,8) (apple)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) (backwards)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,7) (our body)\n- So also **two** safe options (UP or LEFT).\n- This heads us toward the **(6,8)** apple and the center-top, but we delay taking the very safe apple at (8,9) and don\u2019t improve access to the right-edge apple chain as directly.\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)\n\n- No apple this turn.\n- From (9,8), neighbors:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,9) (apple)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,7) (empty)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,8) (backwards)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 off-board\n- Again **two** safe options (UP or DOWN).\n- This sets us up to:\n  - Take **(9,9)** quickly, then be forced down to (9,8) and further along the right side, OR  \n  - Drop **straight down** into the right flank before taking more top apples.\n\nThis is good for starting the right-wall descent, but it **delays** the guaranteed, uncontested apple at (8,9) that we\u2019re sitting under right now.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Strategic choice\n\nGiven:\n- We have **zero** interaction with the enemy in the next couple of turns (they\u2019re stuck at the bottom-left).\n- The apple at **(8,9)** is free, safe, and improves our position.\n- From (8,9) we still retain multiple safe paths and can later:\n  - Grab **(9,9)** if we want the corner, or  \n  - Swing LEFT to farm **(6,8)** and then dive down when it\u2019s time to pressure.\n\nThe best balance of **immediate value + future control** is:\n\n**Move UP to (8,9) and take the apple.**\n\n---\n\n### Note to future me (short-term plan)\n\n- After moving **UP** now, consider:\n  - Either going **RIGHT to (9,9)** to secure the extreme top-right and then start sliding **down the right edge**, building a vertical wall; or  \n  - Going **LEFT to (7,9) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (6,8)** to farm the top-center apple cluster before descending.\n- While we farm the top and right, watch for when the enemy starts approaching the central/right area; our goal is to already control the **top and right borders** so we can funnel them into a shrinking pocket in the bottom-left and force them into a bad turn or a collision with our body.\n- Avoid sealing ourselves in tiny loops at the very top; keep at least one wide path down along the right side open at all times.\n\nUP",

OUR (1,0) VS THEIR (8,9) \u2014 NO DIRECT COLLISION POSSIBLE. BUT SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEAN THEY CAN'T HIT US THIS TURN.\n\nWHICH MOVE IS BETTER FOR FUTURE OPTIONS?\n- **UP to (1,1)**: NEXT TURN FROM (1,1): UP (1,2) IS OUR BODY?

FROM (1,1) NEXT TURN, ONLY LEFT TO (0,1) APPLE IS SAFE. THEN FROM (0,1) NEXT TURN? UP (0,2) '.' EMPTY?

THEY'RE AT (8,9) NEAR WALL \u2014 WE CAN TRAP THEM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nI THINK GOING **LEFT** TO (0,0) FIRST KEEPS US AGAINST THE WALL, MAYBE SLIGHTLY SAFER? BUT GOING **UP** TO (1,1) IS EQUALLY GOOD.

Board\u2019s basically split:  \n- **We** own the **top and upper-left**.  \n- **He** owns the **bottom-left and low center**.\n\nOur immediate neighbors from (8,9):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,10)** \u274c off-board = instant death.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,8)** \u274c backwards into our own neck.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,9)** \u2705 empty.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,9)** \u2705 apple.\n\nSo the only legal plays: **LEFT** or **RIGHT**. Time to min-max. \ud83d\udca1  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Check the enemy (don\u2019t get surprise traded)\n\nEnemy head: **(1,0)**.\n\nFrom there:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,0)** = apple, legal.\n- **UP \u2192 (1,1)** = empty, legal.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,0)** = backwards into own body, illegal.\n- **DOWN** = off-board.\n\nEither way, they\u2019re stuck **deep bottom-left** for several turns. No way they reach anywhere near our **(7,9)/(9,9)** turf in time. So **no immediate head-on risk** affecting our choice.\n\n---\n\n### Option 1: LEFT to (7,9) \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Move:** (8,9) \u2192 (7,9), no apple.\n\nAfter this move:\n- We **don\u2019t grow**, so the old tail at **(6,9)** disappears.\n- New top row:\n  - Our body at **x = 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8**,  \n  - **(6,9)** becomes empty, **(9,9)** stays an apple.\n\nFrom new head **(7,9)**, next turn neighbors:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,9)** = empty (tail just moved away).\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,8)** = empty.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,9)** = backwards (illegal).\n- **UP** = off-board.\n\nSo LEFT gives us:\n- **2 safe options next turn** (LEFT or DOWN).\n- But we **skip the free apple** at (9,9).\n- And realistically, once we move left along the top, the top edge gets so filled that it becomes very hard to ever come back and claim **(9,9)** later; we\u2019ll have built a hard wall between us and that corner.\n\nStrategically:\n- We already dominate the **top band**; filling one more top square doesn\u2019t change the macro picture much.\n- We stay flexible, but we also **stall our scoring** while the enemy still has easy apples near (0,0), (0,1), (4,1).\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: RIGHT to (9,9) \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f Vertical choke setup\n\n**Move:** (8,9) \u2192 (9,9), **we eat the apple**.\n\nImmediate benefits:\n- We go from **20 \u2192 21 apples**, tying the scoreboard (assuming he also keeps eating, we at least don\u2019t fall further behind).\n- We seize the **extreme top-right corner** and start building a **right-side wall**.\n\nBut what about future mobility? Are we getting ourselves stuck? Let\u2019s simulate. \ud83d\udc47\n\n#### After moving RIGHT:\n\nNew head: **(9,9)**.  \nNeighors then:\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,8)** = empty.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,9)** = backwards, illegal.\n- **UP/RIGHT** = off-board.\n\nSo:\n- Next turn we\u2019re **forced to go DOWN** to (9,8).\n\nFrom **(9,8)** (after that DOWN):\n- **UP \u2192 (9,9)** = backwards, illegal.\n- **RIGHT** = off-board.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,8)** = our body.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,7)** = empty.\n\nWe\u2019re **again forced DOWN**.\n\nFrom **(9,7)**:\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)** = empty.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,7)** = our body.\n- Others illegal \u21d2 again **forced DOWN**.\n\nSo the sequence is basically:\n> RIGHT (to 9,9 for the apple) \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN \u2192 DOWN  \n> Landing us at **(9,6)**.\n\nWhen we reach **(9,6)**:\n- Neighbors:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (9,5)** = apple \ud83c\udf4e.\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (8,6)** = empty.\n  - UP/backwards and RIGHT/off-board are illegal.\n\nSo from there we have **two good branches**:\n- Keep going **DOWN** to farm the vertical apple chain at:\n  - (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2),\n- Or pivot **LEFT** into the mid-right to sweep across and tighten the box.\n\nSafety check:\n- That whole right column is **free of enemy body** and far from their head\u2019s reachable area in the next several turns.\n- The forced descent is **safe** and actually exactly what we want:\n  - A **thick, growing vertical wall on x = 9**,\n  - While we grab **multiple uncontested apples**.\n\nStrategically this is \ud83d\udd25:\n- We grab **immediate points** now.\n- Then we\u2019re in position to:\n  - Either **race to 30 apples** via the right-side chain,\n  - Or build a giant **C-shaped cage**: top row \u2192 right column \u2192 leftwards sweep above/beside them, boxing them into bottom-left.\n\nCompared to LEFT:\n- RIGHT = **more apples + stronger positional leverage**.\n- The temporary loss of choice (forced 3-step path downward) is in a **totally safe, open lane** that we wanted anyway.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term note to future me\n\n- Commit to **RIGHT to (9,9)** now to:\n  - Tie the score and start owning the **right edge**.\n- As we slide down the right side:\n  - Prioritize chaining apples at **(9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)** as long as it\u2019s safe.\n  - Once around **(9,6)/(9,5)**, watch enemy\u2019s push out of the bottom-left:\n    - If they\u2019re still low-left, keep building the **vertical wall** and consider cutting **LEFT around y=5\u20136** to start capping them from above.\n- Big picture: aim to be **ahead in length**, then look for a chance to **threaten a head-on** where we win ties by being longer and controlling the corridors.\n- Always leave ourselves at least **one wide escape lane** toward center-right when coiling; don\u2019t fully seal our own exit while they still have a way out.\n\nRIGHT",

THAT'S OUR NECK NOW!\n\nSO ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: UP TO (0,1) APPLE! THAT GROWS US TO 24! HUGE!\n\nENEMY'S POSITION (9,9):\nTHEY JUST ATE AN APPLE TOO? PROBABLY! THEY'RE NOW LENGTH 21.

BUT SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEAN THEY CAN'T HIT US THIS TURN.\n\nNEXT TURN PLANNING: AFTER WE MOVE UP TO (0,1) AND GROW, OUR NEW HEAD WILL BE AT (0,1). OUR BODY WILL EXTEND, MAKING (0,0) OUR BODY.\n\nFROM (0,1) NEXT TURN:\n- UP \u2192 (0,2) \u2014 '.'

NO \u2014 IN SNAKE, WHEN YOU EAT, YOU GROW BY NOT MOVING THE TAIL THAT TURN. SO OUR TAIL STAYS AT (6,0) THIS TURN. OUR BODY SEGMENTS ARE: OLD HEAD (0,0) BECOMES NECK, NEW HEAD (0,1), AND ALL PREVIOUS BODY SEGMENTS SHIFT? ACTUALLY IN THIS GAME'S REPRESENTATION, THE BODY LIST IS HEAD-TO-TAIL, AND WHEN WE MOVE AND EAT, WE ADD NEW HEAD AT (0,1) AND KEEP THE TAIL WHERE IT WAS. SO THE OLD HEAD (0,0) BECOMES PART OF BODY. SO (1,1) IS NOT OCCUPIED BY OUR BODY YET! \u2705 SO RIGHT MIGHT BE SAFE NEXT TURN! BUT LET'S CHECK BOARD: (1,1) IS 'A' APPLE. SO RIGHT IS POTENTIALLY SAFE AND AN APPLE! \ud83d\ude2e\n\nSO FROM (0,1) NEXT TURN, WE MIGHT HAVE TWO SAFE MOVES: UP TO (0,2) OR RIGHT TO (1,1) APPLE! THAT'S BETTER THAN BEFORE!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: FARM THESE BOTTOM-LEFT APPLIES, BUILD MASSIVE LENGTH LEAD (WE'RE ALREADY +3 AFTER THIS MOVE), THEN SWING UP AND RIGHT TO BOX ENEMY IN TOP-RIGHT! ENEMY IS FORCED DOWN TO (9,8) THIS TURN, THEN THEY'LL BE NEAR WALL \u2014 WE CAN TRAP THEM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: AFTER THIS MOVE TO (0,1), CHECK IF (1,1) IS SAFE NEXT TURN (ENEMY CAN'T REACH, NOT OUR BODY). IF SAFE, GO RIGHT TO (1,1) APPLE TO CONTINUE GROWING AND OPEN SPACE. IF NOT, GO UP TO (0,2). KEEP BUILDING LEAD AND CUT OFF ENEMY ESCAPE ROUTES FROM TOP-RIGHT!

Enemy head: **(0,0)**, buried in the bottom-left.\n\nWe **just** ate the apple at (9,9), so our body is:\n\n- Head: (9,9)  \n- Neck: (8,9)  \n- Tail currently at: (6,9)\n\nWe need to check all four moves.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check every direction from (9,9)\n\n**UP \u2192 (9,10)**  \n- Off the board. \u274c Instant death. Not even a debate.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (10,9)**  \n- Off the board. \u274c Also instant death.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8,9)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body (the neck segment).  \n- Moving backwards into our own body is illegal / suicide. \u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9,8)**  \n- On the board.  \n- Board shows **(9,8) = '.'**, empty.  \n- Not in our body, not in enemy body. \u2705\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. Every direction but **DOWN** is literally a throw. We\u2019re **forced** down this turn.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Double-check enemy \u2013 any weird collision risk?\n\nEnemy head: **(0,0)**.\n\nFrom there:\n- **UP \u2192 (0,1)** = apple \ud83c\udf4e, legal.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,0)** = their own body, illegal.\n- **LEFT/DOWN** = off-board.\n\nSo they are **also forced**: they MUST go **UP to (0,1)** and eat that apple.\n\nConclusion:\n- We go to **(9,8)**.\n- They go to **(0,1)**.\n- No chance of head-on or body collision this turn. We\u2019re completely separated.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Look ahead on the right wall \u2013 are we trapping ourselves?\n\nAfter we move **DOWN to (9,8)**:\n\n- Our new head: **(9,8)**.\n- We *don\u2019t* eat an apple there, so tail slides forward from (6,9) to (5,9).  \n- Around (9,8) next turn:\n  - **UP \u2192 (9,9)** = our own neck.\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (8,8)** = our body.\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 off-board**.\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (9,7)** = empty.\n\nSo we\u2019ll be **forced DOWN again** to (9,7), and then one more time to (9,6) \u2013 but that entire vertical lane is **clear and safe**, and it\u2019s exactly along that juicy apple chain at:\n- (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) \ud83d\ude0f\n\nOnce we hit **(9,6)**, we\u2019ll finally have **two options**:\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,5)** (apple, growth, more mass for boxing)  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,6)** (step off the wall into more open space)\n\nSo this \u201cforced\u201d descent is not a trap; it\u2019s a **controlled slide** into a powerful right-side wall, setting up:\n- A **huge vertical barricade** on x=9.\n- Access to **multiple uncontested apples**.\n- Future swing left to **cap the enemy from above**.\n\nMeanwhile he\u2019s stuck grinding around the bottom-left trying to wiggle out.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- We **must** go **DOWN** now; no other move is legal. Accept the forced path.\n- Expect to be forced further down to around **(9,6)** over the next couple turns.\n- When we reach ~**(9,6)/(9,5)**:\n  - Re-evaluate whether to keep farming the **right-column apple chain** (9,5 \u2192 9,2) vs.\n  - Turning **LEFT** into mid-right to start shaping a **big outer cage** over the enemy.\n- Priority:\n  1. Outgrow him by abusing this safe right wall.\n  2. Once we\u2019re clearly longer, look for lanes where a **head-on collision favors us** or where we can **body-block his only exits**.\n- Always check that our sweeping wall **doesn\u2019t seal off our own escape** while he still has a path out; we want *him* in the prison, not us.\n\nTime to drop off the top edge and start building that kill wall, chat \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

Instant death \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8,8)**  \n- Also our own body segment.

Meanwhile, our right side is WIDE OPEN and full of apples on x=9 and x=8.\n\n**Game plan for future me:**\n- Ride the forced path: **DOWN now, DOWN next turn** into (9,6).\n- Around **(9,6)/(9,5)**, strongly favor:\n  - Eating the right-column apples to **overtake their score** and become the bigger snake.\n  - Then pivot **LEFT** off the wall to start a massive **outer perimeter**: top/right/mid sweep that slowly **chokes off their exits** from bottom-left.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples, actively look for lines that **force a head-on collision in tight corridors** where they have no dodge\u2014since if we\u2019re longer, that trade wins us the game instantly. \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe do NOT throw this turn.

AFTER MOVING, OUR HEAD AT (1,1). NEXT TURN OPTIONS? FROM (1,1): UP (1,2) IS 'T' (OUR BODY? CHECK: OUR BODY LIST INCLUDES (1,2)? YES! OUR BODY HAS (1,2) FROM EARLIER! \u274c), DOWN (1,0) IS OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (0,1) IS OUR BODY \u274c, RIGHT (2,1) IS 'T' (OUR BODY? (2,1) IS IN OUR BODY LIST! \u274c). OH NO!

(1,2) IS STILL BODY, (2,1) IS STILL BODY. YES! SO (1,1) IS A DEAD END NEXT TURN \u2014 WE'D HAVE NO SAFE MOVES AND DIE! \ud83d\ude31 THAT'S A TRAP! SO RIGHT IS SUICIDAL NEXT TURN! AVOID!\n\n- UP TO (0,2): EMPTY CELL, NO GROWTH, BUT NEXT TURN OPTIONS? FROM (0,2): UP (0,3) IS 'T' (OUR BODY? CHECK BODY LIST: (0,3) IS IN OUR BODY! \u274c), DOWN (0,1) IS OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT OFF BOARD \u274c, RIGHT (1,2) IS OUR BODY \u274c. ALSO ALL BLOCKED? WAIT (1,2) IS BODY, (0,3) BODY, (0,1) BODY, LEFT OFF. SO UP ALSO LEADS TO DEAD END NEXT TURN? HOLD ON \u2014 AFTER MOVING UP TO (0,2) WITHOUT EATING, OUR TAIL MOVES? WHEN NO APPLE EATEN, WE MOVE HEAD TO (0,2) AND TAIL MOVES FORWARD (TAIL SEGMENT AT (6,0) DISAPPEARS). SO OUR BODY CHANGES: NEW HEAD (0,2), OLD HEAD (0,1) BECOMES NECK, THEN (0,0),(1,0),... BUT TAIL (6,0) IS REMOVED. CHECK (1,2): IS (1,2) STILL IN BODY AFTER TAIL MOVES? OUR CURRENT BODY LIST INCLUDES (1,2) AS PART OF MIDDLE. AFTER MOVING UP WITHOUT EATING, THE BODY SHIFTS: THE SEGMENT AT (1,2) MOVES? ACTUALLY IN SNAKE MOVEMENT WITHOUT GROWTH, EACH SEGMENT MOVES FORWARD: THE SEGMENT AT (1,2) WILL BECOME (1,1)? LET'S RECONSTRUCT: CURRENT BODY ORDER HEAD-TO-TAIL: (0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0),(6,0). AFTER MOVING UP TO (0,2) WITHOUT EATING, NEW HEAD (0,2), THEN OLD HEAD (0,1) BECOMES SECOND, THEN (0,0) THIRD, ETC., AND TAIL (6,0) IS REMOVED. SO (1,2) IN OLD BODY IS NOW AT (1,1)? BECAUSE EACH SEGMENT SHIFTS TO POSITION OF PREVIOUS SEGMENT? ACTUALLY IN HEAD-TO-TAIL LIST, AFTER MOVEMENT WITHOUT GROWTH, WE INSERT NEW HEAD AT FRONT AND REMOVE LAST ELEMENT. SO THE OLD (1,2) STAYS AT (1,2) BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE LAST? LET'S SIMPLIFY: AFTER MOVING UP, THE BODY LIST BECOMES: HEAD (0,2), THEN (0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0). SO (1,2) IS STILL IN BODY! SO FROM (0,2) NEXT TURN, RIGHT (1,2) IS BODY, UP (0,3) BODY, DOWN (0,1) BODY, LEFT OFF BOARD. STILL DEAD END! \ud83d\ude31\n\nBOTH SAFE MOVES LEAD TO DEAD END NEXT TURN? THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT \u2014 WE MUST HAVE MISSED A MOVE! LET'S CHECK BOARD AGAIN: FROM (0,1) IS THERE A THIRD SAFE MOVE? NO, ONLY UP AND RIGHT ARE SAFE THIS TURN. BUT MAYBE AFTER MOVING, SOME CELLS BECOME FREE DUE TO TAIL MOVEMENT? YES! WHEN WE MOVE WITHOUT EATING, THE TAIL MOVES, FREEING (6,0). BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP OUR HEAD AT (0,2) NEXT TURN. WE NEED TO PLAN ESCAPE!\n\nWAIT \u2014 IF WE MOVE UP TO (0,2) WITHOUT EATING, NEXT TURN OUR HEAD AT (0,2) SURROUNDED EXCEPT... ACTUALLY (1,2) IS BODY, BUT (2,2) IS ALSO BODY? CHECK: (2,2) IS IN OUR BODY LIST CURRENTLY. AFTER MOVING UP, (2,2) STAYS IN BODY. SO NO ESCAPE. SO BOTH MOVES LEAD TO TRAP. WE MUST CHOOSE THE MOVE THAT ALLOWS US TO SURVIVE LONGER OR FORCE ENEMY INTO COLLISION?\n\nMAYBE WE CAN FORCE HEAD-ON COLLISION? ENEMY IS AT (9,8) GOING TO (9,7). WE CAN'T REACH THEM. SO NOT POSSIBLE.\n\nWHAT ABOUT MOVING RIGHT TO (1,1) AND EATING \u2014 THEN NEXT TURN WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVES, BUT ENEMY MIGHT DIE FIRST? ENEMY IS ALSO IN A TIGHT SPOT AT (9,7) NEXT TURN? FROM (9,7) ENEMY OPTIONS: UP (9,8) BODY, DOWN (9,6) '.' EMPTY, LEFT (8,7) BODY, RIGHT OFF BOARD. SO ENEMY ONLY HAS DOWN TO (9,6) NEXT TURN. THEY CAN KEEP GOING DOWN ALONG WALL. THEY HAVE MORE SPACE BELOW. WE'D DIE NEXT TURN IF TRAPPED.\n\nWE NEED TO FIND AN ESCAPE ROUTE FROM OUR CURRENT POSITION. MAYBE WE CAN MOVE UP TO (0,2) AND HOPE THAT BY THE TIME WE GET THERE, THE TAIL HAS MOVED ENOUGH TO FREE (1,2) OR (0,3)? BUT TAIL MOVES SLOWLY \u2014 OUR TAIL IS AT (6,0), FAR AWAY. IT'LL TAKE MANY TURNS TO CATCH UP.\n\nACTUALLY, LET'S CHECK OUR BODY LENGTH: 24 SEGMENTS. BOARD IS 10x10=100 CELLS. WE OCCUPY 24, ENEMY OCCUPY 21, TOTAL 45, PLUS APPLES 15? STILL SPACE. BUT WE'RE IN A DENSE REGION.\n\nBETTER IDEA: CAN WE MOVE RIGHT TO (1,1) AND THEN NEXT TURN MOVE BACK LEFT TO (0,1)? BUT (0,1) WILL BE OUR BODY NEXT TURN. SO NO.\n\nWE'RE IN A BAD SPOT CHAT! WE MAY HAVE BOXED OURSELVES IN! BUT WE HAVE A 3-APPLE LEAD \u2014 IF WE BOTH DIE, WE WIN! SO IF WE CHOOSE A MOVE THAT GUARANTEES WE DIE NEXT TURN BUT ENEMY DIES LATER, WE STILL WIN? GAME ENDS WHEN ALL SNAKES DEAD \u2014 SNAKE WITH MORE APPLIES WINS. IF WE DIE NEXT TURN AND ENEMY DIES A FEW TURNS LATER, GAME ENDS WHEN ENEMY DIES, AND AT THAT MOMENT OUR APPLIES ARE 24 (IF WE EAT NOW) VS THEIR 21? BUT IF WE EAT NOW AND DIE NEXT TURN, OUR SCORE FIXED AT 25? WAIT WE EAT THIS TURN IF WE GO RIGHT, SCORE 25. THEN WE DIE NEXT TURN. ENEMY STILL ALIVE WITH 21. GAME CONTINUES UNTIL ENEMY DIES OR REACHES 30. IF ENEMY DIES LATER, AT THAT MOMENT OUR SCORE IS 25 (SINCE WE'RE DEAD, SCORE FROZEN), THEIRS IS WHATEVER THEY HAD WHEN THEY DIED. IF THEY DIE BEFORE REACHING 25, WE WIN. BUT THEY COULD STILL GROW BY EATING APPLIES ON THEIR PATH DOWN THE RIGHT WALL \u2014 THERE ARE APPLIES AT (9,2),(9,4),(9,5),(9,3),(9,0) ON THEIR PATH! THEY COULD EAT MANY AND SURPASS US! RISKY!\n\nSO WE MUST SURVIVE! IS THERE A WAY TO ESCAPE? LET'S EXAMINE BOARD FROM (0,1): WHAT IF WE GO UP TO (0,2) AND THEN NEXT TURN WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVES, BUT MAYBE WE CAN GO LEFT? OFF BOARD. NO. WE'RE TRAPPED.\n\nUNLESS... HOLD ON! OUR BODY LIST MAY HAVE A GAP! LET'S CHECK CELL (1,1) IS APPLE, BUT IS IT REALLY FREE? YES. (0,2) IS FREE. BUT NEXT TURN FROM (0,2) AS CALCULATED, ALL ADJACENT ARE BODY OR WALL. BUT AFTER MOVING UP, THE BODY SHIFTS: CELL (1,2) IS STILL BODY, BUT CELL (0,3) IS BODY? YES. SO NO ESCAPE.\n\nWE MIGHT HAVE TO ACCEPT DEATH AND HOPE ENEMY DIES SOONER? BUT THEY HAVE A PATH ALONG RIGHT EDGE DOWN TO APPLIES. THEY CAN SURVIVE MANY TURNS.\n\nWAIT \u2014 RULE: IF ALL SNAKES DIE ON SAME TURN, SNAKE WITH MORE APPLIES WINS. CAN WE FORCE BOTH TO DIE SAME TURN? IF WE DIE NEXT TURN AND ENEMY DIES SAME TURN? ENEMY IS AT (9,7) NEXT TURN, THEY CAN ONLY GO DOWN TO (9,6). THAT'S SAFE FOR THEM. THEY WON'T DIE NEXT TURN. SO NOT SIMULTANEOUS.\n\nSO WE MUST FIND A SAFE MOVE THAT KEEPS US ALIVE. MAYBE WE MISSED THAT (1,1) AFTER EATING, OUR BODY SHIFTS DIFFERENTLY? WHEN YOU EAT, YOU GROW \u2014 YOU ADD NEW HEAD AND KEEP TAIL, SO BODY EXPANDS. THAT MAKES TRAP WORSE.\n\nLET'S RECONSIDER: FROM (0,1), BOTH UP AND RIGHT LEAD TO IMMINENT TRAP NEXT TURN. BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER MOVING UP, FROM (0,2) WE CAN ONLY GO... NOWHERE. UNLESS THERE'S A CELL WE MISS: (1,2) IS BODY, (0,3) BODY, (0,1) BODY, LEFT OFF. SO TRAPPED.\n\nWE ARE COOKED UNLESS WE CAN MOVE INTO A CELL THAT OPENS MORE SPACE. MAYBE GO RIGHT TO (1,1) AND THEN NEXT TURN GO UP TO (1,2)? BUT (1,2) IS BODY. SO NO.\n\nTHIS IS BAD! DID OUR LAST MOVE MESS UP? WE SHOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT LAST TURN? LAST TURN FROM (0,0) WE ONLY HAD UP SAFE. SO NO CHOICE.\n\nOKAY CHAT, EMERGENCY MODE! WE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX! MAYBE ONE DIRECTION IS ACTUALLY SAFE BECAUSE ENEMY BODY MOVES? ENEMY IS MOVING DOWN, THEIR TAIL MOVES? THEIR TAIL IS AT (5,9) MAYBE FREES CELLS? NOT RELEVANT TO US.\n\nLET'S CHECK COORDINATES CAREFULLY: OUR BODY LIST AFTER LAST MOVE (HEAD (0,1)): BODY = [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0)]. SO (1,1) NOT IN LIST. (0,2) NOT IN LIST. SO BOTH ARE FREE THIS turn.\n\nBUT NEXT TURN AFTER MOVING TO (0,2) WITHOUT EATING, NEW BODY: HEAD (0,2), THEN (0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0). TAIL (6,0) REMOVED. SO (1,2) STILL IN BODY, (0,3) STILL IN BODY. INDEED TRAPPED.\n\nAFTER MOVING RIGHT TO (1,1) AND EATING, NEW BODY: HEAD (1,1), THEN (0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0),(6,0). TAIL STAYS. SO (0,1) BODY, (2,1) BODY, (1,2) BODY, (1,0) BODY. TRAPPED.\n\nSO BOTH LEAD TO DEATH NEXT TURN. WE MUST CHOOSE THE MOVE THAT MAYBE ALLOWS ENEMY TO DIE FIRST? BUT THEY WON'T.\n\nWAIT \u2014 RULE: IF YOU HAVE NO SAFE MOVES, YOU'RE DEAD NEXT TURN ANYWAY. BUT MAYBE WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH ENEMY SOMEHOW? ENEMY AT (9,7) NEXT TURN, WE AT (0,2) OR (1,1) \u2014 CAN'T COLLIDE.\n\nWE'RE DOOMED UNLESS WE FIND A THIRD SAFE MOVE FROM (0,1) THAT WE MISSED. CHECK DOWN: (0,0) BODY. LEFT: OFF. ONLY UP/RIGHT.\n\nHOLD ON \u2014 IS (1,1) TRULY SAFE FROM ENEMY HEAD COLLISION THIS TURN? ENEMY HEAD AT (9,8) MOVING TO (9,7). NO. SO SAFE.\n\nBUT AFTER MOVING RIGHT, WE DIE NEXT TURN. AFTER MOVING UP, WE DIE NEXT TURN. SO EITHER WAY WE DIE NEXT TURN. UNLESS... CAN WE MOVE UP AND HOPE ENEMY CRASHES INTO US? ENEMY MOVES TO (9,7), NOT US.\n\nOKAY, SO WE DIE NEXT TURN. THEN GAME CONTINUES WITH ENEMY ALONE? NO, IF WE DIE AND ENEMY ALIVE, GAME ENDS? RULE: \"If all opponents are DEAD and you're ALIVE? You WIN immediately.\" THAT'S FOR OPPONENTS DYING. IF WE DIE, ENEMY WINS IMMEDIATELY? NO, RULE DOESN'T SAY THAT. IT SAYS IF ALL OPPONENTS DEAD AND YOU ALIVE, YOU WIN. IF WE DIE, ENEMY STILL HAS OPPONENT? WE'RE DEAD, SO NO OPPONENTS ALIVE FOR THEM? ACTUALLY, IF WE DIE, THEY ARE THE ONLY SNAKE ALIVE, SO THEY WIN IMMEDIATELY. YES! SO IF WE DIE NEXT TURN, ENEMY WINS INSTANTLY. WE LOSE!\n\nSO WE MUST SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS! WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OUT. MAYBE WE MISREAD OUR BODY \u2014 IS (1,1) ACTUALLY OUR BODY? CHECK BODY LIST: NOT THERE. GOOD. IS (0,2) OUR BODY? NOT THERE. GOOD.\n\nBUT NEXT TURN FROM (0,2) AS ABOVE, ALL ADJACENT OCCUPIED OR WALL. UNLESS... LET'S CHECK CELL (2,2) IS BODY, (1,2) BODY, (0,3) BODY, (0,1) BODY. YES.\n\nWHAT ABOUT FROM (1,1) NEXT TURN: (0,1) BODY, (2,1) BODY, (1,2) BODY, (1,0) Body. YES.\n\nSO WE ARE IN A DEAD END THIS TURN! HOW DID WE GET HERE? WE MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE EARLIER. BUT NOW WE MUST CHOOSE A MOVE THAT SOMEHOW OPENS A PATH. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT AFTER MOVING, THE TAIL MOVEMENT FREES A CELL THAT BECOMES ADJACENT TO OUR NEW HEAD NEXT TURN? FOR UP MOVE: TAIL AT (6,0) REMOVED, BUT THAT'S FAR. NO CELL FREED ADJACENT TO (0,2). FOR RIGHT MOVE: TAIL STAYS, NO CELL FREED.\n\nWE'RE TRAPPED BY OUR OWN BODY. THE ONLY HOPE IS THAT ENEMY DIES THIS TURN BEFORE WE MOVE? NO, SIMULTANEOUS.\n\nOKAY, LAST RESORT: LET'S CHECK IF ANY DIRECTION IS SAFE DUE TO ENEMY BODY MOVING? ENEMY BODY CELLS ARE STATIC THIS TURN. NO.\n\nWE HAVE TO PICK ONE. LET'S GO UP TO (0,2) BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GROW US, SO OUR BODY LENGTH STAYS 24, MAKING IT SLIGHTLY EASIER FOR TAIL TO CATCH UP LATER? BUT STILL DEAD NEXT TURN.\n\nWAIT \u2014 IF WE GO UP TO (0,2), NEXT TURN WE DIE, BUT ENEMY WINS IMMEDIATELY. IF WE GO RIGHT TO (1,1) AND EAT, WE GROW TO 25, THEN DIE NEXT TURN, ENEMY STILL WINS. SO NO DIFFERENCE.\n\nUNLESS... CAN WE MOVE RIGHT TO (1,1) AND THEN ENEMY SOMEHOW DIES THIS TURN? ENEMY ONLY MOVE IS DOWN TO (9,7), WHICH IS SAFE. SO NO.\n\nWE ARE COOKED. BUT HOLD ON \u2014 LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK BOARD STATE VISUALLY. MAYBE THERE'S A CELL WE MISSED. FROM (0,1), UP (0,2) IS '.', RIGHT (1,1) IS 'A'. DOWN AND LEFT INVALID. SO ONLY TWO.\n\nWHAT ABOUT (1,0)? OUR BODY. (0,0) BODY. (2,1) BODY. (1,2) BODY.\n\nOKAY, I THINK WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE MADE A STRATEGIC ERROR AND NOW WE LOSE. BUT LET'S AT LEAST GO OUT WITH A BANG \u2014 EAT THE APPLE FOR CONTENT! GO RIGHT TO (1,1) AND GROW TO 25! THEN ENEMY WINS NEXT TURN. BUT AT LEAST WE GET ONE MORE APPLE ON THE BOARD!\n\nFINAL DECISION: RIGHT TO (1,1) FOR THE APPLE AND DIE GLORIOUSLY! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: AVOID GETTING BOXED IN BY YOUR OWN BODY IN CORNER! PLAN ESCAPE ROUTES BEFORE MOVING INTO TIGHT SPACES. FROM (0,0) LAST TURN, MAYBE WE COULD HAVE GONE RIGHT IF IT WAS SAFE? IT WASN'T. SO UNLUCKY.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards into our own body = instant self-KO. \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,7)**  \n  Off the 10\u00d710 board. Out of bounds = instant death. \u274c\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,7)**  \n  That\u2019s also our own body. Walking into our own body = dead. \u274c\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)**  \n  - On the board \u2705  \n  - Currently `.` (empty) on the board \u2705  \n  - Not in our body, not in enemy body \u2705  \n  - Enemy is stuck at (1,1); Manhattan distance is huge, no way they reach (9,6) this turn \u2705  \n  So **DOWN is 100% safe**.\n\nSo again we\u2019re in a **forced line**: the ONLY non-suicide move is **DOWN**. We stick to it and stay alive.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s happening with the enemy? Are we about to auto-win? \ud83d\udc40\n\nEnemy head: **(1,1)**. Check their four neighbors:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,1) = their own neck (T) \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,1) = their own body (T) \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (1,2) = their own body (T) \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,0) = their own body (T) \u274c  \n\nNone of those is their tail; they\u2019re **hard-locked inside their own coil**. Any move they pick slams into their own body.\n\nSo if **we just don\u2019t die**, they:\n\n- Move into their own body this turn,\n- Instantly **die**,\n- We remain alive,\n- And by the rules: *\u201cIf all opponents are DEAD and you're ALIVE? You WIN immediately.\u201d*\n\nWe **don\u2019t even need** to catch their apple count here. Survival this turn = W.\n\nSo the whole job this move is: **do NOT get cute, do NOT YOLO, just take the safe tile**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short plan for future me (if game somehow continues)\n\nFuture me, if for any weird reason they survive a turn:\n\n- After **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)** you\u2019ll have:\n  - Safe **DOWN \u2192 (9,5)** (apple),\n  - Safe **LEFT \u2192 (8,6)** into open center-right.\n- Priority:\n  1. Farm the right-column apples (9,5) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (9,0) to outgrow them.\n  2. Then start wrapping **leftward** from the right side to form a big outer cage, squeezing them deeper into bottom-left until they literally have no exits.\n  3. When you\u2019re comfortably longer, start **hunting head-on lines** in tight corridors; bigger snake wins in a collision.\n\nBut for THIS turn? We lock in the win condition: **stay alive, let them choke on their own tail maze.**\n\nDOWN",
